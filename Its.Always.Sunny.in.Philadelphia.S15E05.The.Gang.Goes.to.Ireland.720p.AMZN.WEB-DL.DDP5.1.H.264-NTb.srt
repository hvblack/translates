1
00:00:04,892 --> 00:00:07,340
All right, try to get it
all the way up under her nose.

2
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:08,804
I'm just trying
to stick it in her mouth.

3
00:00:08,804 --> 00:00:11,322
...under her nose should do it
and let it kind of waft up.

4
00:00:11,322 --> 00:00:12,604
Oh, she's starting to wake up

5
00:00:12,604 --> 00:00:14,536
- Wakey, wakey, Dee!

6
00:00:14,579 --> 00:00:17,810
- Good, because I'm getting sick
of trying to keep
the-the hair out of the soup.

7
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:19,940
It's not soup, it's stew,
okay, and you...

8
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:21,261
Same thing, don't correct me.

9
00:00:21,261 --> 00:00:23,529
Soup or stew,
you shouldn't feed it
to an unconscious person.

10
00:00:23,529 --> 00:00:25,062
Yeah, but I'm trying
to use it to wake her up.

11
00:00:25,062 --> 00:00:28,125
Look, she's not gonna eat it,
I'm telling you.
It's not gonna wake her up;
I mean,

12
00:00:28,125 --> 00:00:30,410
I don't think stew has
any arousing components.

13
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:32,611
- What are you talking about?!
The smells, the flavors!
- What is this? What's going on?

14
00:00:32,611 --> 00:00:34,775
That's the whole point
of getting the stew
in the first place.

15
00:00:34,775 --> 00:00:36,243
Wha-What is this? Where am I?

16
00:00:36,243 --> 00:00:40,220
All right, Dee, remember
yesterday when you were waving
that first-class ticket
to Ireland in our faces

17
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:42,572
and bragging about
that acting gig that you got?
- Yeah.

18
00:00:42,572 --> 00:00:45,624
Then you drank yourself
into a stupor and passed out?

19
00:00:46,448 --> 00:00:48,476
I... oh... o-okay.
Yeah, well, uh, good news.

20
00:00:48,476 --> 00:00:51,985
We took that one
first-class ticket,
divided it
into five coach tickets.

21
00:00:51,985 --> 00:00:55,282
And then gave you
just enough sleeping pills
to keep you blissfully asleep

22
00:00:55,282 --> 00:00:58,038
so you could enjoy the flight
and wake up here in Dublin
fully rested.

23
00:00:58,038 --> 00:01:00,980
No. No, you didn't!
You didn't do this.
This-this can't be
happening, no.

24
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:02,705
- Yeah, no, we did.
That's exactly what we did.

25
00:01:02,705 --> 00:01:05,407
We absolutely did. Because we
wanted to be supportive.
- No, you didn't!

26
00:01:05,407 --> 00:01:08,163
- Because we are always there
for each other.
- No, we're not!

27
00:01:08,163 --> 00:01:10,576
- Right, guys?
In good times and in bad.

28
00:01:10,576 --> 00:01:13,173
- And speaking of time,
um, you are late.

29
00:01:13,173 --> 00:01:15,384
You got about 15 minutes
to get to that TV studio.

30
00:01:15,384 --> 00:01:17,110
- No, no, no, no.
Good thing you woke up.

31
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:19,350
- This can't be happening...
- Well, slow down now.

32
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:24,226
- Hey, be sure to look to
the right if you go in the road!
'Cause they drive
on the other side here!

33
00:01:24,226 --> 00:01:27,127
- No, no, no, no, no. No.

34
00:01:27,127 --> 00:01:30,990
Oh, goddamn it!

35
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:38,268
Taxi? Oh, taxi!
- Taxi! Taxi!

36
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:43,185
IRELAND

37
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:04,372
Car!
- Yeah, I see it, Frank,
I can handle the driving.

38
00:02:04,372 --> 00:02:08,253
- Oh, just go faster, goddamn it!
I can't believe
you guys did this to me.

39
00:02:08,253 --> 00:02:10,371
Oh, my God, Dee, we are
driving you to work, okay?

40
00:02:10,371 --> 00:02:13,470
We-we brought you to Ireland.
We brought you here, okay?

41
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:15,799
We didn't have to do that.
Do you know how hard
it was to get you
through customs?

42
00:02:15,799 --> 00:02:17,871
- It was wicked hard, yeah.
- We're doing this for you!

43
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:20,511
Whatever, okay, I think
the studio's right up here.

44
00:02:20,511 --> 00:02:23,237
I'll call you guys around 6:00
or whenever I'm off.

45
00:02:23,237 --> 00:02:25,986
- Why?
- So you can pick me up.

46
00:02:25,986 --> 00:02:31,093
- Dee, we're taking time
out of our Irish vacation
to drive you to work,
now you want us to pick you up?

47
00:02:31,093 --> 00:02:33,889
"Vacation"? You just said
you were here for me!

48
00:02:33,889 --> 00:02:36,771
Well, yeah, we're here for you,
but we're also here
for our vacation.

49
00:02:36,771 --> 00:02:41,099
Yeah, I'm back
in the motherland finally!
I've always wanted to trace
back my family lineage.

50
00:02:41,099 --> 00:02:43,131
I mean, as the most Irish
person here, I really think...

51
00:02:43,131 --> 00:02:45,370
Wait a minute, wait,
whoa, whoa, dude, I'm Irish.

52
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:46,803
Well, yeah, but you're
not as Irish as me.

53
00:02:46,803 --> 00:02:48,561
I could be. You don't know that.
How do you know that?

54
00:02:48,561 --> 00:02:52,135
- Charlie, I have
a shamrock tattooed on my thigh.
- So what?

55
00:02:52,135 --> 00:02:53,905
- I'm gonna show it to you!
You want to see it?!
- No, stop it!
You're squishing me!

56
00:02:53,905 --> 00:02:56,165
- Car! Car!
- I see the car, stop!

57
00:02:56,165 --> 00:02:58,961
Mac, stop!
You're kicking my seat, okay?

58
00:02:59,004 --> 00:03:00,650
Keep your stupid, ugly
shamrock tattoo in your pants.

59
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:03,215
Why did you have to get the
teeny, tiniest car possible?

60
00:03:03,215 --> 00:03:04,920
I'm getting squished back here
and just sucking in
diesel fumes.

61
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,822
What did you want me to do, Dee?

62
00:03:06,822 --> 00:03:10,105
Did you want me to rent
a big obnoxious American truck
like-like that one over there?

63
00:03:10,105 --> 00:03:11,997
That's exactly what we're
trying to get away from.

64
00:03:11,997 --> 00:03:16,250
Okay, you know,
the-the tiny car,
that's all part of the charm
of-of Europe.

65
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:18,133
You know, like driving on
the left-hand side of the road.

66
00:03:18,133 --> 00:03:20,091
Dangerous for Americans like you.

67
00:03:20,091 --> 00:03:23,500
But, you know,
it's authentic and,
and that's what I want,
that's what I'm going for.

68
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,077
- An authentic Irish...

69
00:03:25,077 --> 00:03:27,195
- Get fucked!
- Oh!

70
00:03:27,495 --> 00:03:29,128
...Irish experience.

71
00:03:29,128 --> 00:03:32,323
Okay, just pull over, all right?
Just pull over and let me out!
I'll walk.

72
00:03:32,323 --> 00:03:34,718
You goddamn bastards!

73
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:42,092
Here I am! "Obnoxious American
MILF" reporting for duty, sir!

74
00:03:42,092 --> 00:03:44,171
You're late. You were supposed
to be here an hour ago.

75
00:03:44,171 --> 00:03:46,879
I know, I know,
I hit a little bit of traffic.

76
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:49,997
But if you think about it,
you know, in a way,
I feel like the character
would be late, too,

77
00:03:49,997 --> 00:03:51,560
so it's not really
that big of a...

78
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:54,323
You're lucky this time--
production's running behind,
so we don't need you
for another hour.

79
00:03:54,323 --> 00:03:56,465
Ah, thank God, okay.

80
00:03:56,465 --> 00:03:58,896
Jesus Christ.
What happened to you?

81
00:04:02,442 --> 00:04:04,038
that's a doozy, isn't it?

82
00:04:04,038 --> 00:04:06,604
We can't shoot you like that--
it-it's disturbing!

83
00:04:06,604 --> 00:04:10,170
Well, it's not,
it's not even real.
It-It's just makeup.

84
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:13,517
It's makeup left over
from the show
I did this morning.

85
00:04:13,517 --> 00:04:17,107
- That's makeup?
- Yep, nothing to it
but a little latex and blush.

86
00:04:17,107 --> 00:04:20,737
You know, I just forgot to...
wash... it off.

87
00:04:20,806 --> 00:04:25,000
Um, you know, probably 'cause I
never wear makeup in real life.
'Cause natural beauty.

88
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,556
I'll tell you what, um, since
I do have a little time,
I should just pop out and wash
my face real quick

89
00:04:29,556 --> 00:04:31,300
and-and come
right back, it's not a big deal.

90
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:33,877
Go on, just go on.
Be back in an hour.
And don't be late again.

91
00:04:33,877 --> 00:04:36,648
- Absolutely. I won't be late.
I'm one wet wipe away
from being your MILF.

92
00:04:36,648 --> 00:04:37,862
Can we get cracking here,
people, come on!

93
00:04:37,862 --> 00:04:40,674
Oh, you're gonna want
to F this so bad!

94
00:04:41,092 --> 00:04:44,079
This is so exciting.
I already feel like I'm home.

95
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:47,111
I cannot wait to see the house
that my dad grew up in.

96
00:04:47,183 --> 00:04:50,444
- Apparently it's been
in my family for generations.

97
00:04:50,444 --> 00:04:54,691
- Cool. Yeah, I mean,
I dig it here, man.
You know, you get
all the comforts of Philly.

98
00:04:54,691 --> 00:04:57,118
You got drunks, you got
Irish people, you got, um...

99
00:04:57,118 --> 00:05:02,094
I guess that's
the same thing, but, like,
you also get, like, the magical
mystical element of this place,

100
00:05:02,094 --> 00:05:04,144
you know, you get the banshees
and the spirits and the sprites!

101
00:05:04,144 --> 00:05:06,717
And Shelley! Shelley's here,
which is pretty cool.

102
00:05:06,717 --> 00:05:09,819
- All of those things are made up,
including Shelley.
- Shelley's not made up.

103
00:05:09,819 --> 00:05:12,029
- He's your imaginary friend
that you've had
since you were a kid.

104
00:05:12,029 --> 00:05:15,780
- Dude, he's not my
imaginary friend,
he's my pen pal, okay?
And he's Irish,
that's why his name is Shelley.

105
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:18,418
A pen pal that writes to you
in a magical language.

106
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:22,342
Dude, the guy's real, okay?
And this is why
I know more about
Ireland than you do.

107
00:05:22,342 --> 00:05:23,898
- Hey, stop!
Stop right there, all right?

108
00:05:23,898 --> 00:05:26,159
This is why Irish people
hate Americans.

109
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:30,075
You've got, like,
two percent Irish in you,
and you think you know more
about Ireland than me?

110
00:05:30,075 --> 00:05:32,752
Do you have a shamrock tattoo
somewhere on your body? No.

111
00:05:32,752 --> 00:05:35,349
I do, because that's
my primary identity.

112
00:05:35,349 --> 00:05:37,923
Number one, Irish.
Number two, gay.

113
00:05:37,923 --> 00:05:39,387
Number three, badass.

114
00:05:39,387 --> 00:05:41,607
You're none of those things,
so you should be talking
of none of them.

115
00:05:41,607 --> 00:05:44,395
Are talking
about what you identify as
or what you actually are?

116
00:05:44,395 --> 00:05:45,978
They're the same thing now,
Charlie.

117
00:05:45,978 --> 00:05:49,481
And I can have you canceled
for even suggesting otherwise.
- No, right.

118
00:05:49,481 --> 00:05:53,467
- I have the power to do that.
Because I'm a gay man and you're
just a straight white, cis male.

119
00:05:53,467 --> 00:05:57,799
- Yeah. And Irish, so...
- Will you just be here for me?

120
00:05:57,799 --> 00:06:01,977
- This is a huge day for me
and I just,
I feel like you could...
you could support me
a little bit...

121
00:06:01,977 --> 00:06:04,941
- All right! All right!
- I mean, this is the circle
of life coming full-- oh, oh!

122
00:06:04,941 --> 00:06:06,796
Oh! It-it should be
coming up right here.

123
00:06:06,896 --> 00:06:11,658
Yeah, the House of McDonald is
at this address...

124
00:06:11,658 --> 00:06:13,826
here.

125
00:06:16,323 --> 00:06:19,010
Wow.
Yeah, nailed it.

126
00:06:19,646 --> 00:06:22,207
Cool, so your dad grew up
in a McDonald's or...?

127
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:24,991
No. No, my dad didn't grow up
in a McDonald's.

128
00:06:24,991 --> 00:06:27,471
You sure? 'Cause this is
the House of McDonald.

129
00:06:27,471 --> 00:06:31,476
Hey, oh, you know what, dude?
Maybe you are, like,
from the McDonald family?

130
00:06:31,476 --> 00:06:36,623
Like, like, are you
the Ronald McDonald?
Like, is the hamburger clown
named after you?

131
00:06:36,623 --> 00:06:39,621
I can't tell if you're
making fun of me right now.

132
00:06:39,684 --> 00:06:42,011
- We got to go find out.
I got to, we got to find out.

133
00:06:42,011 --> 00:06:44,004
- You want to get some
more information on that?
- Yeah, let's get some more information.

134
00:06:44,004 --> 00:06:47,199
- Yeah, okay, yeah, 'cause you
could be entitled to
a lot of money.

135
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:54,260
What the hell is this, Frank?
I-I thought we were going
to a distillery.

136
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:56,873
You want an authentic
Irish experience?

137
00:06:56,873 --> 00:07:00,004
There's nothing more Irish
than a corporate tax shelter.

138
00:07:00,004 --> 00:07:05,442
Welcome to the worldwide
headquarters
of Frank's Fluids.

139
00:07:05,442 --> 00:07:08,500
Goddamn. What's that smell?

140
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:12,431
- What smell?
- Oh, it's Ralphie.

141
00:07:12,431 --> 00:07:16,404
Must've got trapped in here.
Looks like he's fused
to the carpet.

142
00:07:16,404 --> 00:07:18,853
- Uh-huh. Is that a cat?
- It was.

143
00:07:18,853 --> 00:07:20,918
Okay, well, that is,
that is grotesque.

144
00:07:20,918 --> 00:07:23,487
- I can't believe
I don't smell that.
- It stinks.

145
00:07:23,487 --> 00:07:26,212
- Guys! Guys! Hey,
acting emergency.

146
00:07:26,212 --> 00:07:30,736
Oh, goddamn, what is that smell?
- That's Ralphie. He's fused.

147
00:07:30,736 --> 00:07:32,634
- Whoa, Dee! That looks bad.

148
00:07:32,634 --> 00:07:35,435
- Yeah, I got myself
a bit of a hematoma here.
Can you guys please help me?

149
00:07:35,435 --> 00:07:38,420
- It's okay, Dee. I got you,
I got you.
This is why we're here.

150
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:40,024
- You know, lucky for you,
I happen to have experience

151
00:07:40,068 --> 00:07:42,673
covering up blunt force trauma,
so...

152
00:07:43,137 --> 00:07:46,039
- Okay, good, so...
- simple fix.
- Great.

153
00:07:46,039 --> 00:07:48,800
We simply need
to redistribute the blood.

154
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,390
- Great, do it, let's go.
- That...

155
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:53,503
- Do it, bitch, go!
- All right.

156
00:07:55,574 --> 00:07:57,823
Oh, God!

157
00:07:59,208 --> 00:08:01,068
Wow, look at that.

158
00:08:01,068 --> 00:08:02,767
Let me see here.

159
00:08:04,039 --> 00:08:06,966
Oh! Oh, shit.
That's like magic.
- Yeah.

160
00:08:06,966 --> 00:08:09,184
Okay, now you guys can
help me with my thing.

161
00:08:09,227 --> 00:08:10,622
We got to shred
a bunch of documents.

162
00:08:10,622 --> 00:08:13,965
What-- whoa, what?
What are you talking about, man?
- Well, the thing of it is, um...

163
00:08:13,965 --> 00:08:17,349
that Frank's Fluids may
or may not have been

164
00:08:17,349 --> 00:08:21,747
the official beverage supplier
of Jeffrey Epstein.

165
00:08:21,747 --> 00:08:24,122
- What?!
- Jeffrey Epstein?!

166
00:08:24,122 --> 00:08:26,640
Yeah. Yeah, but before you
judge me,

167
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:30,811
yes, I was on the sex island,
but only for the snorkeling!

168
00:08:30,811 --> 00:08:32,787
I didn't know anything about
the kid stuff.

169
00:08:32,787 --> 00:08:37,256
- Oh!
- No, look,
95% of what went on down there
- was not pedophilia.
- Oh, yeah?

170
00:08:37,256 --> 00:08:40,320
No, the other five percent,
that sullied
the whole operation.

171
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,898
- Yeah, it sure did, Frank.
- It sure did.

172
00:08:41,898 --> 00:08:46,400
Well, you know,
it ain't just me.
Your guys' names are on those
documents, too, remember?

173
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:49,372
- What? Still? Son of a bitch!
- Goddamn it, Frank!

174
00:08:49,372 --> 00:08:50,677
- No, I don't have time for this!

175
00:08:50,677 --> 00:08:54,634
Well, come on, it'll be quick.
It's only a couple boxes.
- Ah, shit!

176
00:08:57,709 --> 00:09:00,624
Goddamn it!

177
00:09:05,303 --> 00:09:09,055
Bullshit.
This one's bullshit.

178
00:09:09,055 --> 00:09:13,009
All these family tree books...
This one just fell apart.

179
00:09:13,009 --> 00:09:16,681
There's so many
"Mc" and "Mac" names, too.
Like, how are we supposed
to find anything?

180
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:20,287
Dude, I found one right here
in this gibberish book.
There's a whole section
on McDonald.

181
00:09:20,287 --> 00:09:21,983
It's not gibberish,
you just can't read, dude.

182
00:09:21,983 --> 00:09:24,494
Well, uh, well, no, I can
read this. Here, check this out.

183
00:09:24,494 --> 00:09:30,444
"The McDonalds of County Cork
settled in the Lee Valley
as far back as..."

184
00:09:30,444 --> 00:09:36,240
- Wait, wait, wait,
wait a second.
This is, like, Irish or Gaelic
or whatever, whatever they
call it-- you can read that?

185
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:41,183
Well, if "Gaelic"
or "Irish" is-is what you call
the magical gibberish language
that my pen pal taught me,

186
00:09:41,183 --> 00:09:42,527
uh, yes, Mac, I can.

187
00:09:42,527 --> 00:09:46,859
So you're telling me
that you can't read English,
but you can speak and read
an entirely different language?

188
00:09:46,859 --> 00:09:48,614
Uh, I can read it,
I can't speak it.

189
00:09:48,614 --> 00:09:50,788
How can you read something
you can't speak?
It doesn't make any sense.

190
00:09:50,788 --> 00:09:52,600
- I don't know,
it's the mystery
of the magic, I don't know.

191
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:56,154
Plus, you know,
these are Irish words,
and my mouth is made
for American words naturally...

192
00:09:56,154 --> 00:10:01,110
- So your imaginary pen pal was
a real person?
- Yes, dude, that's what I've been
telling you this whole time.

193
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:05,663
My mom was, like, really
invested in me having a pen pal
so she found me this kid,
Shelley Kelly. You know, I...

194
00:10:05,663 --> 00:10:09,208
I'm sorry, your pen pal's name
was Shelley Kelly?
- Yeah.

195
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:11,002
- Have you ever thought
maybe you were related?

196
00:10:11,002 --> 00:10:13,323
- Why?
- Because you have
the same last name.

197
00:10:13,323 --> 00:10:15,294
- He's from Ireland, man!
- Jesus Christ!

198
00:10:15,294 --> 00:10:17,000
Okay, look. Follow me here for a second--

199
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,002
- your mom was a giant whore,
right?
- Yeah.

200
00:10:20,002 --> 00:10:24,026
- Okay.
So maybe she banged
her way through Ireland sometime
in the '70s, right?

201
00:10:24,026 --> 00:10:25,929
And maybe this is,
like, your half brother.

202
00:10:25,929 --> 00:10:28,193
Dude, wait a second.

203
00:10:28,193 --> 00:10:32,648
Now you're finally making some
sense here, because, like,
this guy is like
the Irish version of me.

204
00:10:32,648 --> 00:10:34,632
You know what I mean?
We're into all the same shit.

205
00:10:34,632 --> 00:10:36,685
Um, cheese, ghouls, um...

206
00:10:36,685 --> 00:10:38,414
uh, ghouls, cheese, uh...

207
00:10:38,414 --> 00:10:40,378
Holy shit, man, this is crazy.

208
00:10:40,378 --> 00:10:43,133
- You know what the problem is?
This library's got
too many books.

209
00:10:43,133 --> 00:10:45,701
- And so what I got to do is...
- You need a phone instead.

210
00:10:45,701 --> 00:10:47,027
- Well, I got to go
to the source.

211
00:10:47,027 --> 00:10:50,653
- Of?
- I'm gonna call my mommy.

212
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:56,457
- Hey, Mommy!

213
00:10:56,457 --> 00:11:00,501
- Who is this?
It's... it's me, Mac.

214
00:11:00,614 --> 00:11:02,708
- Yeah, I'm in Ireland.

215
00:11:03,895 --> 00:11:05,620
I miss you, too.

216
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:07,643
- She didn't say that.
- Yes, she did. She did.

217
00:11:07,643 --> 00:11:08,695
- Nah, she didn't. She did not.
- She totally did.

218
00:11:08,695 --> 00:11:13,407
Hey, Mom?
Um, so, anyway, um,
we're in Ireland, and I was
looking for Dad's house,

219
00:11:13,407 --> 00:11:15,991
but the address
you gave me was wrong,

220
00:11:15,991 --> 00:11:19,830
and, like, I kind of can't find
the Luther McDonalds anywhere.

221
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:22,343
- Yeah.
- What do you mean, "yeah"?

222
00:11:22,343 --> 00:11:25,481
Do you have any information
on Dad or our heritage?

223
00:11:25,481 --> 00:11:27,497
- No.
- What do you mean, "no"?

224
00:11:27,447 --> 00:11:29,533
You're not Irish.

225
00:11:29,533 --> 00:11:31,586
- I'm not Irish?
- Yeah.

226
00:11:31,586 --> 00:11:33,558
- Are you joking?
- Nope.

227
00:11:33,558 --> 00:11:36,437
- My last name is McDonald.
- No.

228
00:11:36,437 --> 00:11:39,394
- Are you telling me
that Dad changed his last name?
- Yep.

229
00:11:39,394 --> 00:11:42,032
- What's Dad's last name?
- Vandross.

230
00:11:42,032 --> 00:11:44,628
Dad's name is Luther Vandross?

231
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:46,559
-Are you messing with me?
- No.

232
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:48,269
- Are you Irish?
- Uh-uh.

233
00:11:48,269 --> 00:11:49,974
- What are you?
- Dutch.

234
00:11:49,974 --> 00:11:51,717
- What's Dad?
- Dutch.

235
00:11:51,717 --> 00:11:53,612
Am I Dutch?!

236
00:11:54,182 --> 00:11:58,036
Yeah.
No, Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom,
slow down.

237
00:11:58,036 --> 00:12:01,210
Slow down, be serious, Mom,
be serious!

238
00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:04,994
Am I Irish?

239
00:12:06,191 --> 00:12:07,319
No.

240
00:12:07,319 --> 00:12:11,173
Please-please tell me
th-that's not true.
Please tell me that I'm...

241
00:12:11,522 --> 00:12:13,719
No! No!

242
00:12:13,719 --> 00:12:15,120
You Dutch?

243
00:12:15,181 --> 00:12:18,617
No, th-th-there's
no way I'm Dutch.
There's no way I'm...

244
00:12:18,617 --> 00:12:21,496
You shush! You shush!

245
00:12:22,123 --> 00:12:24,986
Everybody was on the island
that weekend.

246
00:12:24,986 --> 00:12:30,187
Jizzaline...
the-the computer guy
with the little weird glasses?

247
00:12:30,187 --> 00:12:31,922
He didn't do anything
with the kids.

248
00:12:31,922 --> 00:12:34,184
But he was really
into the manatees.

249
00:12:34,236 --> 00:12:37,385
Which, by the way,
also got very sexual.

250
00:12:37,385 --> 00:12:41,124
Frank...
can you, can you
just stop talking
about sexual things
with manatees.

251
00:12:41,124 --> 00:12:45,480
The following year,
he doesn't show up,
the manatee's
all bent out of shape.

252
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:50,129
Frank, can you please stop?
I-I'm looking for someone
and you're distracting me.

253
00:12:50,129 --> 00:12:53,066
I mean, this manatee was
so depressed,

254
00:12:53,066 --> 00:12:56,100
she actually swam
into a boat propeller.

255
00:12:56,100 --> 00:13:00,001
Boom! Blammo!
Mantacide.

256
00:13:00,001 --> 00:13:05,322
The moral of the story is
the heart wants
what the heart wants.

257
00:13:05,322 --> 00:13:06,792
It was all consensual.

258
00:13:06,877 --> 00:13:10,476
Except for the kids,
thus the shredding.

259
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:14,527
- Wait, oh, Frank, Frank,
I've found her.
- Who?

260
00:13:14,527 --> 00:13:19,262
- The perfect woman
with the perfect
head of Irish hair.

261
00:13:19,262 --> 00:13:22,666
What, what the hell,
what the hell is that?
With the hair thing--

262
00:13:22,666 --> 00:13:24,656
what are
you, some kind of freak?

263
00:13:24,656 --> 00:13:30,535
Here's the thing.
I've always noticed that
redheads have a distinct odor.

264
00:13:30,535 --> 00:13:32,901
A pleasant odor, to be clear.

265
00:13:32,901 --> 00:13:37,308
But, um, a peculiar scent
that is quite different
than all other hair types.

266
00:13:37,369 --> 00:13:39,580
And I've always wondered,
like, is that a genetic thing?

267
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:44,700
Or is it some sort of mutation
that sprung from generations
of being away
from the motherland, so...

268
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:47,997
I wanted to find a native with
an authentic head of Irish hair.

269
00:13:47,997 --> 00:13:52,962
And this little lass over there
is the perfect specimen.

270
00:13:52,962 --> 00:13:55,718
- Uh-huh.
- The perfect woman, I mean.
Woman.

271
00:13:55,718 --> 00:13:57,858
She's the perfect woman.

272
00:13:57,858 --> 00:13:59,832
I'll be back.

273
00:14:03,228 --> 00:14:05,769
- Hi, how are you?
- Lovely. How are you?

274
00:14:05,769 --> 00:14:10,169
- I'm great, I'm great.
Are you from Ireland?
- How'd you guess?

275
00:14:10,256 --> 00:14:12,165
- Oi!

276
00:14:12,165 --> 00:14:14,640
- Liar!
- What the hell are you doing?

277
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:17,287
What the hell are you doing?
You're not Irish.

278
00:14:17,287 --> 00:14:20,564
Or if you are,
that-that's a wig.
There's no smell at all to you.

279
00:14:20,564 --> 00:14:23,016
Am I to believe
that you're a natural redhead
and yet there's no odor?

280
00:14:23,016 --> 00:14:25,507
No odor at all?
No, I don't believe you.

281
00:14:25,507 --> 00:14:28,105
Are you okay, hon?
You seem a little nutted.

282
00:14:28,105 --> 00:14:31,867
Oh, no, I'm fine.
If anyone's nutted, it's you.
Okay, if "nutted" means
that you're a liar.

283
00:14:31,923 --> 00:14:33,162
- Have you got a temp check yet?

284
00:14:33,162 --> 00:14:35,555
- What are you talk...?
Don't-don't point
that thing at me.

285
00:14:35,635 --> 00:14:37,129
Jesus. You have a fever.

286
00:14:37,129 --> 00:14:38,878
Okay, well, if I'm hot,

287
00:14:38,921 --> 00:14:41,134
it's only because you've
riled me up with your lies.

288
00:14:41,134 --> 00:14:43,363
My friend and I have traveled a
long way to this country and...

289
00:14:43,363 --> 00:14:45,337
- Is that him?
- Yeah.

290
00:14:45,337 --> 00:14:47,640
You can't dump
your rubbish in the beer!

291
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:51,552
That's not rubbish,
it's, uh, shredded documents
from a sex island, it's...

292
00:14:51,552 --> 00:14:54,820
I'm not gonna explain it
to you because, uh,
it sounds worse than it is.

293
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:57,648
- You need to leave!
- I'm going to leave.
I want to leave.

294
00:14:57,648 --> 00:15:00,491
I'm gonna go find
real Irish people,
who have odors 

295
00:15:00,491 --> 00:15:04,265
 and don't
make people smell them,
only to find out
that they have no odor at all!

296
00:15:04,265 --> 00:15:08,151
That's crazy!
Good day to you.

297
00:15:09,383 --> 00:15:12,802
Hey, Frank,
we got to go, man, come on.
We're getting kicked out.

298
00:15:12,802 --> 00:15:15,045
Someone lied and I got angry.

299
00:15:15,545 --> 00:15:19,120
Wait a minute.
Hold on a second.

300
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:23,465
- Hey, Charlie!
- Yo, Frank.
Hey, man.
Can you come pick us up?

301
00:15:23,465 --> 00:15:27,368
We got booted out of the library
'cause Mac's freaking out.
He just found out he's Dutch.

302
00:15:27,368 --> 00:15:29,929
Aw, that's gonna be
a whole thing.

303
00:15:29,972 --> 00:15:31,278
Oh, dude,
it's a whole thing already.

304
00:15:31,321 --> 00:15:32,714
He's being super annoying
about it.

305
00:15:32,757 --> 00:15:34,759
We just got tossed
out of this pub,

306
00:15:34,803 --> 00:15:37,023
because Dennis was smelling
somebody's hair.

307
00:15:37,066 --> 00:15:39,286
You can't smell something
that's got no odor, Frank.

308
00:15:39,329 --> 00:15:40,852
Oh, really?
Weird.

309
00:15:40,896 --> 00:15:42,898
Hey, look, dude, I found out

310
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:44,813
I might have, like,
a half brother or something.

311
00:15:44,856 --> 00:15:46,989
So maybe we can, like, take this
trip out to the countryside?

312
00:15:47,033 --> 00:15:48,425
I'd really love
to meet up with this guy.

313
00:15:48,469 --> 00:15:50,688
A brother? That's weird.

314
00:15:50,732 --> 00:15:52,560
Well, the country sounds good.

315
00:15:52,603 --> 00:15:54,518
I can fold in
my shred-and-spread.

316
00:15:54,562 --> 00:15:56,390
Oh, you're doing
a shred-and-spread?

317
00:15:56,433 --> 00:15:58,044
We haven't done
one of those in years, man!

318
00:15:58,087 --> 00:16:00,046
I'm gonna kill myself, Frank.

319
00:16:00,089 --> 00:16:02,352
He's not really gonna do it,
dude, he's just being dramatic.

320
00:16:02,396 --> 00:16:04,528
- Do it, bitch!
- Yeah, do it, bitch.

321
00:16:04,572 --> 00:16:05,965
I'm not really gonna do it.
It's just a cry for help.

322
00:16:06,008 --> 00:16:07,836
Yeah, no shit! Just-just
come pick us up, all right?

323
00:16:07,879 --> 00:16:10,012
All right, all right, goodbye!

324
00:16:10,056 --> 00:16:11,448
- Wait, let me get this bag...
- Let's go.

325
00:16:11,492 --> 00:16:13,015
Come on, let's get
this stuff out of here.

326
00:16:13,059 --> 00:16:14,190
This is ridiculous, man.
What are you doing?

327
00:16:14,234 --> 00:16:15,713
You're throwing it in a keg,
seriously?

328
00:16:15,757 --> 00:16:17,193
What, what are you gonna do?
I got to get rid of 'em.

329
00:16:20,849 --> 00:16:23,286
She has arrived, the obnoxious
American MILF is walking!

330
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:25,419
The MILF is walking.

331
00:16:25,462 --> 00:16:28,248
- You're two hours late.
- Am I now? Oh, gosh. Well,

332
00:16:28,291 --> 00:16:30,206
I did get caught up in a little
bit of a shred-and-spread,

333
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:31,816
plus it's hard to tell
with the time difference.

334
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:33,862
Um, you can show me
to my trailer now.

335
00:16:33,905 --> 00:16:35,603
And I'd love a cup of coffee--
two creams, please?

336
00:16:35,646 --> 00:16:36,734
- Uh...
- Holy shit.

337
00:16:36,778 --> 00:16:38,127
What?

338
00:16:38,171 --> 00:16:39,563
I am so confused.

339
00:16:39,607 --> 00:16:41,348
Is this more makeup?

340
00:16:43,437 --> 00:16:46,048
Oh, goddamn! I mean...

341
00:16:46,092 --> 00:16:49,617
Yeah, yeah, it looks
as though the makeup

342
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:52,794
did redistribute down
into my, my eye area.

343
00:16:52,837 --> 00:16:54,578
I think just a quick touch-up

344
00:16:54,622 --> 00:16:56,580
from a professional
would do the trick.

345
00:16:56,624 --> 00:16:58,234
Okay, ma'am, I don't know
what's going on with you,

346
00:16:58,278 --> 00:17:00,323
- but please leave my set.
- Hmm?

347
00:17:00,367 --> 00:17:02,282
No, no, no, no... no, come on.
Give me a chance, please.

348
00:17:02,325 --> 00:17:04,762
I can still be an obnoxious
American mom you'd like to F!

349
00:17:04,806 --> 00:17:06,373
Please, just give me a chance.

350
00:17:06,416 --> 00:17:08,810
I'm sorry,
we've already recast your part.

351
00:17:12,248 --> 00:17:13,858
You!

352
00:17:13,902 --> 00:17:15,730
Do you two know each other?

353
00:17:15,773 --> 00:17:18,515
- What are you doing here?
- What are you doing here?

354
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:19,908
- I asked you first!
- Okay!

355
00:17:19,951 --> 00:17:21,910
I've just been
backpacking across Europe.

356
00:17:21,953 --> 00:17:23,433
About an hour ago,
some guy approached me,

357
00:17:23,477 --> 00:17:25,087
said I'd be perfect
for an obnoxious American MILF.

358
00:17:25,131 --> 00:17:26,871
Here I am.

359
00:17:26,915 --> 00:17:28,221
You don't know what you're
doing! You're not even an actor.

360
00:17:28,264 --> 00:17:30,179
- Neither are you.
- Oh, you bitch!

361
00:17:30,223 --> 00:17:32,094
- Oh, you dumb bitch!
- Okay.
- Security!

362
00:17:32,138 --> 00:17:33,052
- Get this woman off my set!
- Don't you start!

363
00:17:33,095 --> 00:17:34,270
- Security!
- Don't you--

364
00:17:34,314 --> 00:17:36,098
Come on, man!
Okay, okay, okay, it's fine!

365
00:17:36,142 --> 00:17:38,231
Okay, it's fine.
Everyone, listen, please.

366
00:17:38,274 --> 00:17:39,754
Please, please, I'm begging you.

367
00:17:39,797 --> 00:17:41,234
I'm begging you--
I need this so bad!

368
00:17:41,277 --> 00:17:42,931
I need this worse

369
00:17:42,974 --> 00:17:44,454
than I've ever needed
anything in my entire life.

370
00:17:44,498 --> 00:17:45,890
Please give me a role, any role.

371
00:17:45,934 --> 00:17:48,284
A speaking role.
I'll say anything.

372
00:17:50,547 --> 00:17:52,897
I'll also do anything.

373
00:17:52,941 --> 00:17:54,812
That won't be necessary.

374
00:17:54,856 --> 00:17:56,771
Is it the black eyes, like...?

375
00:17:56,814 --> 00:17:58,077
Because I don't trade roles
for sex.

376
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:59,469
Oh, goddamn feminists
ruin everything.

377
00:17:59,513 --> 00:18:00,905
- Come on, man.
- Okay, okay, okay.

378
00:18:00,949 --> 00:18:03,125
L-Look, we're
casting for the role

379
00:18:03,169 --> 00:18:05,432
of "abused wife" for a scene
that shoots tomorrow.

380
00:18:05,475 --> 00:18:07,564
- Huh?
- It's only one line, but...

381
00:18:07,608 --> 00:18:09,610
I suppose given
your current face situation...

382
00:18:09,653 --> 00:18:12,047
Yes, I'll take it! I'll nail it!

383
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:14,441
I'm gonna be fucking hilarious!
Oh, my God!

384
00:18:14,484 --> 00:18:16,791
You'll see,
you'll see how funny I am.

385
00:18:16,834 --> 00:18:18,532
- The role is "abused wife."
- Yeah.

386
00:18:18,575 --> 00:18:20,273
There's nothing funny about it.

387
00:18:20,316 --> 00:18:22,710
Oh, dramatic role.

388
00:18:22,753 --> 00:18:24,625
Even better.
That's where the awards are.

389
00:18:24,668 --> 00:18:27,193
Yeah, whatever. Just be here
tomorrow at 7:00 a.m.

390
00:18:27,236 --> 00:18:28,977
- Okay, yep, yep. No, I won't.
- And don't be late.

391
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:31,284
Abused wife!
Is it Abused Wife Number One?

392
00:18:31,327 --> 00:18:34,461
Or-- It doesn't matter.
Oh, my God, I'm gonna nail it.

393
00:18:36,027 --> 00:18:38,595
Well, gentlemen,
this driving experience has

394
00:18:38,639 --> 00:18:40,423
become much more charming
now that I've

395
00:18:40,467 --> 00:18:42,817
- switched to driving
on the correct side of the road.
- Huh?

396
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:44,340
- See, the Irish are
so accommodating.

397
00:18:44,384 --> 00:18:47,082
They-they don't want to drive
headfirst into a maniac.

398
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:49,432
- They will simply move
to avoid us.

399
00:18:49,476 --> 00:18:52,609
- Uh-huh.

400
00:18:52,653 --> 00:18:55,090
Dude, are you sick?

401
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:57,484
I'm not sick.

402
00:18:57,527 --> 00:19:00,139
I think I'm c-coughing 'cause
of all the European exhaust.

403
00:19:00,182 --> 00:19:02,489
The air is probably thick
with, uh, petrol.

404
00:19:02,532 --> 00:19:04,273
He can't smell nothing.

405
00:19:04,317 --> 00:19:05,927
- Plus he's got a fever.
- What?

406
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:07,711
Do you think you might
have COVID, dude?

407
00:19:07,755 --> 00:19:09,887
I-I don't have COVID, okay?

408
00:19:09,931 --> 00:19:11,672
- It's probably just, like,
allergies or something.

409
00:19:11,715 --> 00:19:14,196
You know? Swerve, asshole!

410
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,850
Do you want to collide
with an oncoming car?!

411
00:19:18,374 --> 00:19:21,072
Oh, my God, I'm on a call sheet!

412
00:19:21,116 --> 00:19:23,640
That's my name!
I can't believe this!

413
00:19:23,684 --> 00:19:25,816
I'm gonna be an abused wife!

414
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:27,731
Oh!

415
00:19:27,775 --> 00:19:30,256
This is the greatest day
of my life-- oh, shit!

416
00:19:30,299 --> 00:19:32,127
Got to look right
when you're in Ireland.

417
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:34,129
- That would've been stupid...

418
00:19:35,739 --> 00:19:37,393
- Oh!
- Oh, shit!

419
00:19:37,437 --> 00:19:39,221
- Oh, G...
- No.

420
00:19:39,265 --> 00:19:40,918
- That's not good.
- Come on.

421
00:19:40,962 --> 00:19:43,443
- Aw, man!
- Oh, goddamn it, Dee!

422
00:19:43,486 --> 00:19:45,314
Why weren't you looking?

423
00:19:45,358 --> 00:19:47,360
- Well, she looked right.
- Well, you got
to look both ways.

424
00:19:47,403 --> 00:19:49,753
I mean,
that's standard shit, man.

425
00:19:49,797 --> 00:19:51,494
All right, well, don't yell
at her-- she's unconscious.

426
00:19:51,538 --> 00:19:53,322
All right, you know
what, Frank, give her some stew.

427
00:19:53,366 --> 00:19:55,281
- I finished the stew.
- All right, uh, maybe

428
00:19:55,324 --> 00:19:57,152
breathe your stewy breath
in her face?

429
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:59,328
Stew and stew breath
have never--

430
00:20:00,808 --> 00:20:02,984
You definitely have COVID, man.

431
00:20:03,027 --> 00:20:05,378
You're the only one
that didn't get vaccinated.

432
00:20:05,421 --> 00:20:08,598
I'm fine, I'm fine. Now, we
told Dee that we were gonna

433
00:20:08,642 --> 00:20:10,165
pick her up from her acting gig,
and that's what we're gonna do.

434
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:11,775
We're gonna,
we're gonna pick her up.

435
00:20:11,819 --> 00:20:13,864
Pick her up? I mean...

436
00:20:13,908 --> 00:20:16,084
she's all gangly
and then I'm gonna be crammed

437
00:20:16,127 --> 00:20:17,955
in the backseat
with an unconscious person.

438
00:20:17,999 --> 00:20:19,783
Like, is there
anything else we can do?

439
00:20:26,921 --> 00:20:28,749
All right, th-this is
just gonna be much better,

440
00:20:28,792 --> 00:20:30,968
- I think, you know?
- We should've done this
from the very beginning.

441
00:20:31,012 --> 00:20:33,144
- Yeah!
- Guys, I think
we're finally on vacation.
