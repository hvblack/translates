1
00:00:01,136 --> 00:00:04,065
>>> YOU'RE WATCHING FOX AND
FRIENDS.

2
00:00:05,476 --> 00:00:08,525
GOOD MORNING

3
00:00:11,473 --> 00:00:14,444
>> WELCOME TO FOX AND FRIENDS.
I'M STEVE DUCEY

4
00:00:14,444 --> 00:00:18,517
HERE WITH BRIAN
KILLMEADE AND AMY.

5
00:00:18,517 --> 00:00:22,994
>> HI, EVERYBODY.
HAPPY THANKSGIVING AND WAKANDA
FOREVER.

6
00:00:22,994 --> 00:00:25,111
>> I DON'T THINK WE'RE ALLOWED
TO SAY THAT.

7
00:00:25,111 --> 00:00:27,147
>> EVERYBODY CHILL.

8
00:00:27,147 --> 00:00:30,373
>> WHAT A TERRIBLE WEEK FOR THE
GOP.

9
00:00:30,373 --> 00:00:33,791
THE DEMS ARE RETAINING CONTROL
OF THE SENATE,

10
00:00:33,791 --> 00:00:38,262
SO WHAT THE HECK
HAPPENED TO THAT RED WAVE THAT
PEOPLE WERE TALKING ABOUT?

11
00:00:38,262 --> 00:00:40,182
>> YEAH.
WHO WAS PROMISING THAT?

12
00:00:40,182 --> 00:00:42,493
BECAUSE COULDN'T HAVE BEEN US
EVERY DAY.

13
00:00:42,493 --> 00:00:45,374
>> WELL, THANKFULLY THERE'S NO
WAY TO CHECK,

14
00:00:45,374 --> 00:00:47,066
BUT IT DEFINITELY DIDN'T HAPPEN,

15
00:00:47,066 --> 00:00:50,630
AND ACCORDING TO
EVERYBODY, ONLY ONE MAN WAS TO
BLAME.

16
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:52,593
LOOK AT THESE HEADLINES.

17
00:00:52,593 --> 00:00:57,425
TRUMPTY DUMPTY.
FIRE

18
00:00:57,425 --> 00:01:00,330
>> AND LOOK AT THIS UP ED.

19
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:05,675
MR. DeSANTIS, WILL YOU BE MY NEW
DADDY?

20
00:01:05,675 --> 00:01:09,402
>> NOW, WHO WROTE THAT?
>> ERIC TRUMP.

21
00:01:09,402 --> 00:01:12,732
>> SEEMS LIKE EVERYBODY IS
TURNING ON TRUMP.

22
00:01:12,732 --> 00:01:17,432
>> AND PER A COMPANY-WIDE EMAIL
WE GOT THIS MORNING, HE'S DEAD
TO US.

23
00:01:17,432 --> 00:01:23,331
>> NEARLY EVERY CANDIDATE,
TRUMP-BACK LOST THIS WEEK,

24
00:01:23,331 --> 00:01:26,746
EXCEPT FOR ONE WHO'S STILL
HANGING ON BY A THREAD,

25
00:01:26,746 --> 00:01:31,153
AND
SHE'S HERE WITH US TODAY.
PLEASE WELCOME KARI LAKE.

26
00:01:31,153 --> 00:01:33,134
>> HELLO THERE.
HI.

27
00:01:33,134 --> 00:01:35,221
GREETINGS FROM ARIZONA

28
00:01:35,221 --> 00:01:39,105
WHERE THE AVERAGE AGE AND TEMPERATURE IS
95.

29
00:01:39,403 --> 00:01:41,513
>> HI, KARI.
THANKS FOR BEING HERE

30
00:01:41,513 --> 00:01:45,400
DURING
WHAT MUST BE A VERY STRESSFUL
TIME FOR YOUR CAMPAIGN.

31
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,646
>> HEY.
MY CAMPAIGN ISN'T DEAD YET

32
00:01:47,646 --> 00:01:51,682
EVEN
THOUGH ANY CAMERA FILTER MAKES
IT LOOK LIKE I'M IN HEAVEN.

33
00:01:51,682 --> 00:01:55,283
>> THIS SEEMS LIKE THIS IS A
RACE YOU WOULD EASILY WIN,

34
00:01:55,283 --> 00:02:00,108
REAL
YOU AND YOUR OPPONENT ARE
CURRENTLY NECK AND NECK.

35
00:02:00,108 --> 00:02:04,510
>> THAT IS BECAUSE THE MARICOPA
COUNTY OFFICIALS ARE INCOMPETENT,

36
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:08,867
AND IT'S MY BELIEF
THE ELECTION IS RIGGED AND THE
RESULTS SHOULD BE THROWN OUT.

37
00:02:08,867 --> 00:02:14,055
>> SOUNDS LIKE SOME NEW NUMBERS
ARE COMING IN WHICH HAS YOU
TAKING A NARROW LEAD OVER
KATIETY HOBBS.

38
00:02:14,055 --> 00:02:17,474
>> WHICH IS WHY I'VE ALWAYS SAID

39
00:02:17,474 --> 00:02:20,023
TRUST THE SYSTEM, TRUST THE
VOTE.

40
00:02:20,023 --> 00:02:23,730
>> ANOTHER SYSTEM JUST CAME IN,
AND YOU ARE LOSING AGAIN.

41
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:26,975
>> BECAUSE OUR SYSTEM IS BROKEN.

42
00:02:26,975 --> 00:02:29,543
>> YOU'RE BACK IN THE LEAD.

43
00:02:29,543 --> 00:02:31,728
>> THANKFULLY, IT'S NOW FIXED.

44
00:02:31,728 --> 00:02:36,932
I'M 100% CONFIDENT I'M GOING TO
WIN THIS ELECTION,

45
00:02:36,932 --> 00:02:40,574
AND I WON'T
STOP FIGHTING UNTIL EVERY VOTE
IS COUNTED

46
00:02:40,574 --> 00:02:42,724
AND SOME VOTES ARE
TAKEN AWAY.

47
00:02:42,724 --> 00:02:45,725
BECAUSE WHO DO AARIZONAENS WANT
LEADING THEM?

48
00:02:45,725 --> 00:02:48,215
KATIE HOBBS WHO'S HIDING IN A
BASEMENT

49
00:02:48,215 --> 00:02:53,386
OR ME,  KARI LAKE WHO
LIVES RIGHT HERE IN THIS
BEAUTIFUL POOL OF VASELINE

50
00:02:53,386 --> 00:02:56,780
AND IS OUT THERE EVERY DAY AT CVS

51
00:02:56,780 --> 00:03:00,192
ASKING BLACK CUSTOMERS IF THEY
WORK HERE.

52
00:03:01,066 --> 00:03:04,107
>> WELL, WE ARE ROOTING FOR YOU,
KARI.

53
00:03:04,107 --> 00:03:06,458
WE KNOW THE VOTES WILL GO YOUR
WAY.

54
00:03:06,458 --> 00:03:10,182
>> WELL, IF THEY DON'T, I'LL
BURN ARIZONA TO THE GROUND.

55
00:03:10,182 --> 00:03:12,239
>> SHE WAS NICE.

56
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:15,212
>> I HOPE THE TRUMP EFFECT DON'T
MESS WITH HER CAMPAIGN.

57
00:03:15,212 --> 00:03:18,155
>> YOU DON'T THINK HE STILL
WATCHES OUR SHOW.

58
00:03:18,155 --> 00:03:21,483
>> WELL, HE'S AT HIS DAUGHTER'S
WEDDING THIS WEEKEND,

59
00:03:21,483 --> 00:03:24,245
SO AT
LEAST WE KNOW HE WON'T CALL IN.

60
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,680
>> HELLO.
IT'S YOUR FAVORITE PRESIDENT.

61
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,546
>> NEW PHONE.
WHO DIS?

62
00:03:31,546 --> 00:03:34,338
>> HE'S JUST KIDDING.
HI, DONALD.

63
00:03:34,421 --> 00:03:36,574
CONGRATULATIONS ON TIFFANY'S
WEDDING.

64
00:03:36,574 --> 00:03:39,058
>> WHO?
OH, YEAH.

65
00:03:39,058 --> 00:03:41,535
IT'S OKAY.
THEY'RE JUST DOING THE VOWS.

66
00:03:41,535 --> 00:03:46,079
>> GREAT.
WE WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT YOU.

67
00:03:46,079 --> 00:03:50,806
THERE WAS THAT NEW YORK POST
HEADLINE THAT CALLED YOU TRUMPTY DUMPTY

68
00:03:50,806 --> 00:03:53,015
AND SAID YOU HAD
A GREAT FALL.

69
00:03:53,015 --> 00:03:57,389
>> WELL, I AGREE.
I HAD A GREAT FALL AND A GREAT
SUMMER AS WELL.

70
00:03:57,389 --> 00:04:01,070
MANY SAY I WILL HAVE A GREAT
WINTER AS WELL.

71
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:04,319
HAVING A GREAT FALL.
THE LEAVES ARE TURNING RED.

72
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:09,373
IT'S A RED WAVE IN TERMS OF TREE
AND WITH REGARD TO LEAF.

73
00:04:09,373 --> 00:04:15,460
>> WELL, WE HEARD THAT YOU'RE
BLAMING BOTH SEAN HANNITY AND
MELANIA.

74
00:04:15,461 --> 00:04:17,727
FOR ADVISING

75
00:04:17,727 --> 00:04:20,971
>> IT'S TRUE.
LET ME TELL YOU, IT'S VERY HARD
BEING IN A FIGHT

76
00:04:20,971 --> 00:04:24,288
WERE YOUR SOUL
MATE AND ALSO MELANIA.

77
00:04:24,288 --> 00:04:29,084
NOW ALL ANYBODY WANTS TO TALK
ABOUT IS RON DeSanctimonious

78
00:04:29,084 --> 00:04:32,426
I KNOW. I'M SURPRISED I KNOW THAT WORD,
TOO.

79
00:04:32,426 --> 00:04:34,340
BUT RON HAD IT SO EASY.

80
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:38,040
>> YOU SAID DeSANTIS HAS THE
ADVANTAGE OF SUNSHINE.

81
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:40,646
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
EVERYONE GOES TO FLORIDA FOR THE
SUNSHINE.

82
00:04:40,646 --> 00:04:43,050
I MADE RON DeSANTIS.

83
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:48,054
HE WAS GOING TO LOSE UNTIL I
SENT FBI AGENTS TO GO FIX HIS
ELECTION.

84
00:04:48,054 --> 00:04:49,414
>> YOU ADMITTED TO WHAT?

85
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:53,640
>> BUT HE'S UNGRATEFUL AND HE'S
TRYING TO STEAL MY SUNSHINE JUST
LIKE LYNN.

86
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:58,295
THEY WERE A ONE-HIT WONDER.
GOT TO GO SEE.

87
00:04:58,295 --> 00:05:03,252
AND THESE ELECTION RESULTS ARE
MAKING US GO, HOW BIZARRE.

88
00:05:03,252 --> 00:05:05,141
HOW BIZARRE.

89
00:05:05,141 --> 00:05:08,023
WE'RE ALL HEARING THAT ALL THE
TIME, RIGHT?
HOW BIZARRE.

90
00:05:08,023 --> 00:05:11,525
>> DON'T YOU NEED TO LIKE WALK
YOUR DAUGHTER DOWN THE AISLE?

91
00:05:11,525 --> 00:05:14,354
>> MISSED IT.

92
00:05:14,354 --> 00:05:17,089
ANYWAY, WHAT ARE YOU GUYS
TALKING ABOUT?
YOU SEE

93
00:05:17,089 --> 00:05:21,546
>> MR. PRESIDENT, I DON'T KNOW
HOW TO TELL YOU THIS, BUT WE'VE
MOVED ON.

94
00:05:21,546 --> 00:05:24,056
WE CAN'T HAVE YOU ON THE SHOW
ANYMORE.

95
00:05:24,056 --> 00:05:27,579
>> WHAT?
WHAT DID I DO?

96
00:05:27,579 --> 00:05:31,284
WAS IT THE INSURRECTION?
>> NO.

97
00:05:31,284 --> 00:05:32,924
>> THE IMPEACHMENTS?
>> NO.

98
00:05:32,924 --> 00:05:34,781
>> BLACKMAILING UKRAINE?
>> NO.

99
00:05:34,781 --> 00:05:36,317
>> CHARLOTTESVILLE?
>> NO.

100
00:05:36,318 --> 00:05:38,154
- WALL?
- NO.

101
00:05:38,154 --> 00:05:39,398
>> THE MURDER?

102
00:05:39,398 --> 00:05:40,708
KIDDING.

103
00:05:42,195 --> 00:05:44,510
IT WAS BECAUSE YOU LOST.

104
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:47,547
WE DIDN'T SEE A FUTURE WITH YOU,

105
00:05:47,547 --> 00:05:50,404
BUT WE CAN STILL BE FRIENDS.

106
00:05:50,404 --> 00:05:51,567
BYE

107
00:05:51,567 --> 00:05:55,416
>> WAIT, WAIT.
I HAVE A BIG ANNOUNCEMENT
NOVEMBER 15th.

108
00:05:55,416 --> 00:05:59,382
DON'T PUSH ME OFF.
I HAVE A BIG ANNOUNCEMENT, AND
IT'S NOT WHAT YOU THINK.

109
00:05:59,382 --> 00:06:02,048
I'M RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT AGAIN.

110
00:06:02,048 --> 00:06:05,291
>> OH, MY.

111
00:06:07,257 --> 00:06:11,262
>> THAT WAS AWKWARD.

112
00:06:11,262 --> 00:06:13,433
BUT WE'RE FINALLY FREE.

113
00:06:13,433 --> 00:06:17,324
CHANGE IS ON THE HORIZON, AND I
HAVE A PRETTY GOOD IDEA

114
00:06:17,324 --> 00:06:20,728
WE WON'T
BE HEARING FROM HIM AGAIN.

115
00:06:20,728 --> 00:06:22,994
AND HE'S CALLING MY PHONE.

116
00:06:22,994 --> 00:06:24,889
>> AND MINE.

117
00:06:24,889 --> 00:06:26,155
>> MINE TOO.

118
00:06:26,155 --> 00:06:29,338
>> WHOA.
KARI, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

119
00:06:29,338 --> 00:06:32,802
>> YOU THINK IF I LOSE, I'M JUST
GOING TO GO AWAY?
NOT ON YOUR LIFE.

120
00:06:32,883 --> 00:06:35,680
WE'LL BE BACK FOR MORE KARI AND
FRIENDS.

121
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:40,186
AND LIVE FROM NEW YORK, IT'S
SATURDAY NIGHT!

122
00:08:47,553 --> 00:08:52,579
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, DAVE
CHAPPELLE.

123
00:09:15,322 --> 00:09:19,828
>> THANK YOU.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING
HERE.

124
00:09:19,828 --> 00:09:23,304
BUT BEFORE I START TONIGHT, I
JUST WANTED TO READ

125
00:09:23,304 --> 00:09:26,827
A BRIEF
STATEMENT THAT I PREPARED.

126
00:09:29,419 --> 00:09:33,273
I HAVE STIGMATISM IN ALL ITS FORMS,

127
00:09:34,973 --> 00:09:39,223
AND I STAND WITH MY
FRIENDS IN THE JEWISH COMMUNITY.

128
00:09:39,223 --> 00:09:42,797
AND THAT, KANYE,

129
00:09:42,797 --> 00:09:46,499
IS HOW YOU BUY YOURSELF SOME TIME.

130
00:09:53,869 --> 00:09:56,024
I GOT TO TELL YOU GUYS,

131
00:09:56,024 --> 00:09:59,863
I PROBABLY BEEN DOING THIS 35
YEARS NOW.

132
00:09:59,863 --> 00:10:05,508
AND EARLY IN MY CAREER, I
LEARNED THAT THERE WERE TWO
WORDS IN THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE

133
00:10:05,508 --> 00:10:07,723
THAT YOU SHOULD NEVER SAY
TOGETHER IN SEQUENCE,

134
00:10:07,723 --> 00:10:09,307
AND THOSE WORDS

135
00:10:09,307 --> 00:10:13,288
ARE "THE" AND "JEWS."

136
00:10:13,288 --> 00:10:17,709
I'VE NEVER HEARD NO ONE DO GOOD
AFTER THEY SAID THAT.

137
00:10:22,661 --> 00:10:24,649
Kanye's gotten into some scrapes before.

138
00:10:24,649 --> 00:10:28,541
NORMALLY WHEN HE'S IN TROUBLE, I
PULL UP IMMEDIATELY.

139
00:10:28,541 --> 00:10:32,007
BUT THIS TIME, I WAS LIKE, YOU
KNOW WHAT?
LET ME SEE WHAT'S GOING TO
HAPPEN FIRST.

140
00:10:32,007 --> 00:10:35,898
SEE

141
00:10:37,412 --> 00:10:40,067
I CAN'T REMEMBER HOW IT STARTED.

142
00:10:40,067 --> 00:10:43,854
VAGUELY I REMEMBER IT STARTED
WITH A TWEET, STRANGE TWEET.

143
00:10:43,854 --> 00:10:47,204
IT WAS LIKE, I'M FEELING A
LITTLE SLEEPY.

144
00:10:49,658 --> 00:10:54,308
I'M GOING TO GET ME SOME REST,
BUT WHEN I WAKE UP,

145
00:10:54,634 --> 00:11:00,830
I'M GOING TO
GO DEFCON THREE ON THE JEWS.

146
00:11:02,109 --> 00:11:05,366
AND THEN HE JUST WENT TO BED.

147
00:11:05,366 --> 00:11:11,531
I WAS UP ALL NIGHT WORRIED.
WHAT IS HE TRYING TO DO TO THE
JEWS?

148
00:11:17,251 --> 00:11:20,135
I GREW UP AROUND JEWISH PEOPLE.

149
00:11:20,185 --> 00:11:21,929
I HAVE A LOT OF JEWISH FRIENDS,

150
00:11:21,929 --> 00:11:23,888
SO I'M NOT FREAKED OUT BY YOUR
CULTURE.

151
00:11:23,888 --> 00:11:25,680
I KNOW A LITTLE BIT ABOUT IT
HANGING AROUND.

152
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,333
LET'S HANG OUT AFTER SCHOOL
TOMORROW.

153
00:11:27,333 --> 00:11:29,453
WE CAN'T GO OUT.
IT'S SHA-NA-NA TOMORROW.

154
00:11:29,454 --> 00:11:31,125
WHAT?

155
00:11:33,429 --> 00:11:36,014
WHAT IS SHA-NA-NA?

156
00:11:36,015 --> 00:11:37,789
QUESTIONS

157
00:11:37,789 --> 00:11:41,284
WHY DO SO MANY OF YOUR PEOPLE
DRESSILY R.E.M. DMC?

158
00:11:46,648 --> 00:11:50,629
WOKE UP FROM A TINY NAP AND WENT
TO WORK.

159
00:11:52,783 --> 00:11:57,178
A YEAR AGO, I'VE SEEN HIM ON A
PODCAST CALLED DRINK CHAMPS.

160
00:11:57,178 --> 00:12:01,461
GREAT SHOW, AND IT WAS AN
AMAZING APPEARANCE.

161
00:12:01,462 --> 00:12:06,226
Noreaga
RAPPERS THAT I LOVE WERE THERE
AND THEY ALL HAD THEIR GOLD
CHAINS AND STUFF ON.

162
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:10,325
KANYE SAID, ONLY MILLIONAIRES
WEAR CHAINS.

163
00:12:10,325 --> 00:12:12,335
THEY SAID WHAT?

164
00:12:12,335 --> 00:12:14,445
HE SAID, I'M A BILLIONAIRE.

165
00:12:14,445 --> 00:12:17,797
BILLIONAIRES DON'T WEAR THEIR
MONEY ON THEIR BODY.

166
00:12:17,797 --> 00:12:20,847
I TUCKED MY CHAIN, AND I SAID,
OH, SNAP.

167
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:29,941
GOOD APPEARANCE.
FUN AND FUNNY.

168
00:12:29,941 --> 00:12:32,374
WHEN HE WOKE UP, HE WENT ON
DRINK CHAMPS AGAIN.

169
00:12:32,374 --> 00:12:35,411
THIS TIME, HE WAS MAD ABOUT
SOMETHING.

170
00:12:35,411 --> 00:12:39,514
HE SAID, I CAN SAY ANTI-SEMITIC THINGS,

171
00:12:39,514 --> 00:12:43,927
AND ADIDAS CAN'T DROP ME.
NOW WHAT?

172
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:47,713
THEY DROPPED THAT NIGGER
IMMEDIATELY.

173
00:12:51,161 --> 00:12:55,232
IRONICALLY, ADIDAS WAS FOUNDED BY NAZIS,

174
00:12:55,232 --> 00:12:57,874
AND THEY WERE
OFFENDED.

175
00:12:57,874 --> 00:13:02,487
PASS THE TEACHER.

176
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:11,093
IT'S A BIG DEAL.

177
00:13:11,093 --> 00:13:13,754
HE BROKE SHOW BUSINESS RULES.

178
00:13:13,754 --> 00:13:17,350
IS THIS A RULE?
YOU KNOW, THE RULES OF
DECEPTION.

179
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:19,786
IF THEY'RE BLACK, THEN IT'S A
GANG.

180
00:13:19,786 --> 00:13:21,474
IF THEY'RE TINY, IT'S A MOB.

181
00:13:21,474 --> 00:13:23,366
IF THEY'RE JEWISH, IT'S A
COINCIDENCE

182
00:13:23,366 --> 00:13:26,461
AND YOU SHOULD NEVER
SPEAK ABOUT IT.

183
00:13:30,795 --> 00:13:34,525
KANYE GOT IN SO MUCH TROUBLE,
KYRIE GOT IN TROUBLE.

184
00:13:45,443 --> 00:13:51,458
KYRIE IRVING POSTED A LINK TO A
MOVIE HE HAD SEEN ON AMAZON.

185
00:13:51,459 --> 00:13:53,635
NO CAPTION

186
00:13:53,635 --> 00:13:58,139
APPARENTLY IT HAD SOME
ANTI-SEMITIC JOKES OR SOMETHING.

187
00:13:58,139 --> 00:14:02,026
IT WAS SOME WEIRD TITLE LIKE
FROM HERO TO NEGRO OR SOMETHING.

188
00:14:04,434 --> 00:14:08,652
THE NBA TOLD HIM TO APOLOGIZE,
AND HE WAS SLOW TO APOLOGIZE.

189
00:14:08,652 --> 00:14:12,893
SO THE LIST OF DEMANDS GOT
LONGER AND LONGER.

190
00:14:12,893 --> 00:14:16,468
AND THIS IS WHERE I DRAW THE
LINE.

191
00:14:16,468 --> 00:14:20,418
I KNOW THE JEWISH PEOPLE HAVE
BEEN THROUGH TERRIBLE THINGS ALL OVER THE WORLD,

192
00:14:20,418 --> 00:14:24,048
BUT YOU CAN'T
BLAME THAT ON BLACK AMERICANS.

193
00:14:24,127 --> 00:14:25,687
JUST CAN'T

194
00:14:25,758 --> 00:14:27,137
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

195
00:14:27,137 --> 00:14:30,333
THANKS THE ONE PERSON.

196
00:14:31,627 --> 00:14:35,088
I'M SAYING PUNISHMENT WOULD BE
JUST TO POST A LINK TO SHINLER'S LIST

197
00:14:35,088 --> 00:14:37,528
AND Y'ALL WRITE YOUR OWN
CAPTIONS.

198
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:45,111
KYRIE IRVING'S BLACK ASS WAS
NOWHERE NEAR THE HOLOCAUST.

199
00:14:45,111 --> 00:14:48,865
IN FACT, HE'S NOT EVEN CERTAIN
IT EXISTS.

200
00:14:55,384 --> 00:14:59,027
I SAW ONE NEWS WOMAN SCREAMING
ABOUT KANYE.

201
00:14:59,027 --> 00:15:03,668
SHE SAID, MENTAL HEALTH IS NO
EXCUSE FOR THAT TYPE OF
LANGUAGE.

202
00:15:03,668 --> 00:15:06,494
YES, IT IS, BITCH.

203
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:09,933
IF YOU MENTALLY ILL

204
00:15:09,933 --> 00:15:13,856
LISTEN.
OKAY.
I DON'T THINK KANYE IS CRAZY AT
ALL.

205
00:15:13,856 --> 00:15:17,687
I THINK HE'S POSSIBLY NOT WELL.

206
00:15:22,065 --> 00:15:24,535
I'VE BEEN TO HOLLYWOOD.

207
00:15:24,535 --> 00:15:27,018
I DON'T WANT Y'ALL TO GET MAD AT
ME.
I'M JUST TELLING YOU.

208
00:15:27,018 --> 00:15:30,138
I HAVE BEEN TO HOLLYWOOD.
THIS IS WHAT I SAW.

209
00:15:31,686 --> 00:15:34,771
IT'S A LOT OF JEWS.

210
00:15:38,031 --> 00:15:40,660
LIKE A LOT.

211
00:15:42,729 --> 00:15:44,824
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING.
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

212
00:15:44,824 --> 00:15:48,978
There's a lot of Black people in Ferguson, Missouri.
It doesn't mean we run the place.

213
00:15:55,381 --> 00:15:59,483
I CAN SEE IF YOU HAD SOME KIND
OF ISSUE.
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

214
00:15:59,483 --> 00:16:03,322
MIGHT GO OUT TO HOLLYWOOD AND
START CONNECTING SOME KIND OF LINES,

215
00:16:03,322 --> 00:16:08,245
AND YOU CAN MAYBE ADOPT
THE ILLUSION THAT JEWS RUN SHOW
BUSINESS.

216
00:16:08,245 --> 00:16:11,289
NOT A CRAZY THING TO THINK.

217
00:16:11,289 --> 00:16:15,760
BUT IT'S A CRAZY THING TO SAY
OUT LOUD
in a climate like this

218
00:16:25,151 --> 00:16:27,995
NOW THE MIDTERMS ARE OVER
AND IT'S CRAZY CLIMATE.

219
00:16:27,995 --> 00:16:32,792
AND I HAVE TO TELL YOU, I FEEL
LIKE THIS MIDTERM IS LIKE ALL OF
HUMANITY DEPENDS ON IT.

220
00:16:32,792 --> 00:16:37,560
And it's an ominous sign.
THE MOST OMINOUS SIGN I BELIEVE
WOULD BE HERSCHEL WALKER,

221
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:42,250
WHO I
DON'T WANT TO SPEAK BAD OF
BECAUSE HE'S BLACK.

222
00:16:42,741 --> 00:16:47,348
BUT I HAVE TO ADMIT, HE'S

223
00:16:47,348 --> 00:16:50,556
OBSERVABLY STUPID.

224
00:16:57,085 --> 00:17:01,130
EVEN WHEN HE'S NOT TALKING, HIS
MOUTH BE OPEN A LITTLE BIT
LIKE --

225
00:17:03,764 --> 00:17:08,612
HE'S THE KIND OF GUY THAT LOOKS
LIKE HE THINKS BEFORE HE MAKES A
MOVE ON TIC TAC TOE.

226
00:17:16,209 --> 00:17:19,805
WATCHING THE NEWS NOW, THEY'RE
DECLARING THE END OF THE TRUMP
ERA.

227
00:17:19,805 --> 00:17:23,381
I CAN SEE HOW IN NEW YORK YOU
BELIEVE IT'S THE END OF HIS ERA.

228
00:17:23,381 --> 00:17:28,719
I'LL BE HONEST WITH YOU, I LIVE
IN OHIO AMONGST THE POOR WHITES.

229
00:17:30,129 --> 00:17:34,045
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY TRUMP
WAS SO POPULAR.

230
00:17:34,045 --> 00:17:36,878
I GET IT.
I HEAR HIM EVERY DAY.

231
00:17:36,878 --> 00:17:38,620
HE'S VERY LOVED.

232
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:44,287
THE REASON WHY IS BECAUSE PEOPLE
IN OHIO HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYBODY
LIKE HIM.

233
00:17:44,287 --> 00:17:47,530
HE'S WHAT I CALL AN HONEST LIAR.

234
00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:51,311
I'M NOT JOKING.
HE IS AN HONEST LIAR.

235
00:17:51,311 --> 00:17:55,559
THAT FIRST DEBATE, I'D NEVER
SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT.

236
00:17:55,559 --> 00:17:58,611
I'D NEVER SEEN A WHITE MALE
BILLIONAIRE

237
00:17:58,611 --> 00:18:01,058
SCREAMING AT THE TOP
OF HIS LUNGS,

238
00:18:01,058 --> 00:18:04,081
THIS WHOLE SYSTEM
IS RIGGED, HE SAID.

239
00:18:04,081 --> 00:18:07,767
AND ACROSS THE STAGE WAS A WHITE
WOMAN, HILLARY CLINTON AND BARACK OBAMA

240
00:18:07,767 --> 00:18:10,073
sitting there looking at him like
NO, IT'S
NOT.

241
00:18:10,073 --> 00:18:13,939
I SAID, WAIT A MINUTE, BRO.
IT'S WHAT HE SAID,

242
00:18:13,939 --> 00:18:16,590
AND THE
MODERATOR SAID, WELL,

243
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:20,966
IF IN FACT
THE SYSTEM IS RIGGED AS YOU SUGGEST,

244
00:18:20,966 --> 00:18:22,503
WHAT WOULD BE YOUR
EVIDENCE?

245
00:18:22,503 --> 00:18:24,864
REMEMBER WHAT HE SAID, BRO?

246
00:18:24,864 --> 00:18:29,255
HE SAID, I KNOW THE SYSTEM IS RIGGED

247
00:18:29,255 --> 00:18:31,111
BECAUSE I USE IT.

248
00:18:31,141 --> 00:18:34,618
I SAID, GOD DAMN!

249
00:18:35,672 --> 00:18:38,032
THEN PULLS OUT AN ILLUMINATI
MEMBERSHIP CARD

250
00:18:38,032 --> 00:18:41,695
chopped a line of cocaine up in it

251
00:18:45,383 --> 00:18:48,009
NO ONE'S EVER HEARD ANYONE SAY
ANYTHING SO TRUE.

252
00:18:48,009 --> 00:18:52,035
and then Hillary Clinton tried to punch him in the taxes.
She said, 'This man doesn't pay his taxes,'

253
00:18:52,035 --> 00:18:55,312
HE SHOT RIGHT BACK -- THAT MAKES
ME SMART!

254
00:18:58,592 --> 00:19:03,532
AND THEN HE SAID, IF YOU WANT ME
TO PAY MY TAXES,

255
00:19:03,532 --> 00:19:05,786
THEN CHANGE THE TAX CODE

256
00:19:05,786 --> 00:19:09,626
BUT I KNOW YOU WON'T
BECAUSE YOUR FRIENDS AND DONORS

257
00:19:09,626 --> 00:19:13,122
ENJOY THE SAME TAX BREAK THAT I
DO.

258
00:19:13,122 --> 00:19:18,487
AND WITH THAT, MY FRIENDS, A
STAR WAS BORN.

259
00:19:18,487 --> 00:19:20,368
NO ONE HAD EVER SEEN ANYTHING
LIKE THAT.

260
00:19:20,368 --> 00:19:23,679
NO ONE HAD EVER SEEN ANYONE COME
FROM INSIDE THAT HOUSE

261
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:25,654
OUTSIDE
AND TELL ALL THE COMMONERS,

262
00:19:25,743 --> 00:19:30,838
WE'RE DOING EVERYTHING YOU THINK
WE'RE DOING INSIDE THAT HOUSE.

263
00:19:30,871 --> 00:19:35,040
HE WENT RIGHT BACK IN THE HOUSE
AND STARTED PLAYING A GAME
AGAIN.

264
00:19:38,304 --> 00:19:41,537
DEMOCRATS ARE SORE LOSERS.

265
00:19:41,537 --> 00:19:44,010
I'M A DEMOCRAT.
I'M TELLING YOU, AS SOON AS HE WON,

266
00:19:44,010 --> 00:19:47,783
THEY STARTED SAYING, HE'S
COLLUDING WITH RUSSIA.

267
00:19:47,783 --> 00:19:51,344
IT'S VERY EMBARRASSING AS A
DEMOCRAT.
BUT AS TIME WENT ON,

268
00:19:51,756 --> 00:19:54,517
WE ALL CAME TO LEARN,

269
00:19:54,941 --> 00:19:57,826
HE WAS PROBABLY
COLLUDING WITH RUSSIA.

270
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:05,353
I EVEN LOOK AT HIS WIFE
DIFFERENT NOW.

271
00:20:05,353 --> 00:20:07,461
HIS WIFE THE BEAUTIFUL, NO
QUESTION ABOUT IT.

272
00:20:07,461 --> 00:20:11,706
BUT SHE LOOKS LIKE THE SAME
CHICK THAT JAMES BOND WOULD
SMASH BUT NOT TRUST.

273
00:20:18,475 --> 00:20:22,041
WHY ALL THEM DOCUMENTS AT HIS
HOUSE?

274
00:20:22,041 --> 00:20:24,723
THIS GUY IS FAMOUS FOR NOT
READING HIS press briefings

275
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:29,126
AND NOW HE GOT
10,000 DOCUMENTS
and won't take them

276
00:20:31,022 --> 00:20:34,263
I HAVE BEEN FIRED FROM JOBS MANY
TIMES IN MY LIFE,

277
00:20:34,263 --> 00:20:36,977
AND I WILL BE
VERY HONEST WITH YOU.
SOMETIMES WHEN I WAS FIRED,

278
00:20:36,977 --> 00:20:39,522
I
STOLE THINGS FROM THE OFFICE.

279
00:20:39,522 --> 00:20:42,357
STAPLE GUNS, COMPUTER MOUSES,
ALL THAT KIND OF STUFF.

280
00:20:42,357 --> 00:20:46,257
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT I NEVER STOLE
FROM WORK?
WORK.

281
00:20:53,769 --> 00:20:56,663
War in Ukraine brought it all into focus.

282
00:20:56,663 --> 00:20:58,715
LUCKY FOR EVERYBODY IN THE
WESTERN WORLD,

283
00:20:58,715 --> 00:21:03,569
THE UKRAINIANS
ARE WAY BETTER FIGHTERS THAN WE
THOUGHT THEY WOULD BE.

284
00:21:03,569 --> 00:21:06,403
I mean these guys, God bless them.

285
00:21:07,348 --> 00:21:11,034
>> THEY KILLED 10,000 RUSSIANS
THE FIRST WEEK OF THE WAR.

286
00:21:11,034 --> 00:21:15,273
EVEN VIETNAMESE WERE LIKE, THEM
ARE SOME GOOD NUMBERS!

287
00:21:19,466 --> 00:21:22,151
THIS WAS BEFORE THEY HAD
WEAPONS.

288
00:21:22,151 --> 00:21:26,693
BEFORE WE STARTED SENDING THEM
WEAPONS, THEY WERE KILLING
RUSSIANS WITH STUFF YOU CAN FIND
AROUND THE HOUSE.

289
00:21:26,693 --> 00:21:29,935
That whole country of Ukraine
was littered with traps
LIKE HOME ALONE.

290
00:21:29,935 --> 00:21:31,222
THEY WERE STEPPING ON RAKES

291
00:21:31,222 --> 00:21:34,252
AND LIKE AHH!

292
00:21:38,748 --> 00:21:41,578
HOW IS RUSSIA LOSING TO THE
UKRAINE?

293
00:21:41,578 --> 00:21:44,834
THAT WOULD BE LIKE AMERICA
LOSING A WAR TO COLORADO.

294
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:53,311
NOW THE MIDTERMS ARE OVER AND
EVERYBODY'S AWAKE.

295
00:21:53,311 --> 00:21:56,367
THESE NEW WHITES, THEY'RE LIKE

296
00:21:56,367 --> 00:21:59,433
NEWBORN BABIES WHO JUST WOKE UP.

297
00:21:59,433 --> 00:22:03,391
EVERYTHING WHITE PEOPLE MAD
ABOUT, WE HAVE BEEN ON THAT.

298
00:22:03,391 --> 00:22:08,089
MAN, I CAN'T SEE MY FAMILY.
WE BE LIKE, WE BEEN ON THAT!

299
00:22:08,388 --> 00:22:13,140
MAN, WE CAN'T TRUST THE
GOVERNMENT.
WE BEEN ON THAT?

300
00:22:13,468 --> 00:22:15,857
WHY DON'T YOU DISMANTLE THE FBI?

301
00:22:15,857 --> 00:22:19,725
WORD TO MARTIN LUTHER KING, BRO.
WE'VE BEEN ON THAT.

302
00:22:25,592 --> 00:22:29,359
Nobody listens to me when I tell these jokes,
you ignore me.

303
00:22:29,359 --> 00:22:32,555
MY FIRST NETFLIX SPECIAL, WHAT
DID I SAY?

304
00:22:32,612 --> 00:22:37,037
I SAID, I DON'T WANT TO SNEAK A
DEAL BECAUSE THE MINUTE I SAY
SOMETHING THAT MAKES THOSE
PEOPLE MAD,

305
00:22:37,037 --> 00:22:38,600
THEY'RE GOING TO
TAKE MY SNEAKERS AWAY.

306
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:40,496
AND THE WHOLE CROWD WAS
LAUGHING.

307
00:22:41,670 --> 00:22:46,163
Now you see Kanye walking
around L.A. barefoot with his chain on.

308
00:22:55,562 --> 00:23:00,982
THIS GUY LOST 1.5 BILLION IN A
DAY.

309
00:23:00,982 --> 00:23:04,275
$1.5 BILLION A DAY.

310
00:23:04,275 --> 00:23:07,574
I SAW THAT AND I SAID, PUT YOUR
CHAIN ON.
WELCOME BACK.

311
00:23:16,243 --> 00:23:20,450
IT SHOULDN'T BE THIS SCARY TO
TALK ABOUT ANYTHING.

312
00:23:20,450 --> 00:23:22,776
IT'S MAKING MY JOB INCREDIBLY
DIFFICULT.

313
00:23:22,854 --> 00:23:26,529
AND TO BE HONEST WITH YOU, I'M
SICK OF TALKING TO A CROWD LIKE
THIS.

314
00:23:26,529 --> 00:23:30,022
I LOVE YOU TO DEATH, AND I THANK
YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT.

315
00:23:30,022 --> 00:23:33,477
AND I HOPE THEY DON'T TAKE
ANYTHING AWAY FROM ME,

316
00:23:34,308 --> 00:23:37,543
WHOEVER

385
00:26:47,259 --> 00:26:49,658

COULD BE.

396
00:27:10,978 --> 00:27:11,365
