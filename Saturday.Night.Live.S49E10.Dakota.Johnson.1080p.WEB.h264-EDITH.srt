1
00:00:02,189 --> 00:00:06,360
>>> YOU'RE WATCHING THE AFC
CHAMPIONSHIP ON CBS.

2
00:00:09,584 --> 00:00:12,263
>> HELLO EVERYONE WELCOME TO THE
AFC CHAMPIONSHIP

3
00:00:12,263 --> 00:00:14,606
BETWEEN THE
BALTIMORE RAVENS AND THE KANSAS
CITY CHIEFS.

4
00:00:14,606 --> 00:00:16,738
I'M JIM NANTZ ALONGSIDE TONY
ROMO.

5
00:00:16,739 --> 00:00:19,048
SHOUTOUT

6
00:00:19,048 --> 00:00:20,947
DO YOU LOVE TO SHAKE, RATTLE,
AND ROLL?

7
00:00:20,947 --> 00:00:25,220
BECAUSE YOU'LL DO ALL THREE ON A
BOEING MAX 739.

8
00:00:25,221 --> 00:00:29,444
CAUSE

9
00:00:29,444 --> 00:00:31,687
ARE YOU EXCITED FOR TODAY'S
MATCHUP?

10
00:00:31,687 --> 00:00:32,910
>> WITHOUT A DOUBT, JIM.

11
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:36,973
WE'VE GOT TWO GENERATIONAL
TALENTS AT QUARTERBACK, TWO
ELITE DEFENSES.

12
00:00:36,973 --> 00:00:40,019
I EXPECT IT TO BE AN ALL-OUT
BATTLE FOR THE NEXT THREE HOURS.

13
00:00:40,019 --> 00:00:43,391
AND AFTER THAT, IT'S ALL OVER.

14
00:00:43,391 --> 00:00:45,748
>> ALL OVER?
>> FOOTBALL.

15
00:00:45,748 --> 00:00:50,063
AFTER TODAY, IT'S JUST -- IT'S
DONE.

16
00:00:50,063 --> 00:00:52,126
>> WELL, THERE'S STILL THE SUPER
BOWL.

17
00:00:52,126 --> 00:00:54,388
>> YEAH, BUT THAT'S NOT REAL
FOOTBALL.

18
00:00:54,388 --> 00:00:57,346
SUPER BOWL IS FOR COMMERCIALS AND USHER

19
00:00:57,346 --> 00:01:02,037
AND PEOPLE WHO NEVER
WATCH FOOTBALL ASKING HOW MANY
POINTS A TOUCHDOWN IS WORTH.

20
00:01:02,099 --> 00:01:07,000
TODAY'S THE LAST REAL FOOTBALL
DAY FOR JUST US GUYS.

21
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,183
>> TONY, ARE YOU OKAY, BUD?

22
00:01:10,183 --> 00:01:12,367
>> NAH, NOT REALLY.

23
00:01:12,367 --> 00:01:16,386
>> ALL RIGHT.
WELL, LET'S THROW IT OVER TO
JAMES BROWN AND OUR HALF TIME CREW

24
00:01:16,386 --> 00:01:18,135
FOR A SNEAK PEEK AT WHAT'S
AHEAD.

25
00:01:18,135 --> 00:01:21,289
>> THANKS, JIM.
I'M HERE WITH PHIL SIMMS,

26
00:01:21,289 --> 00:01:23,935
BILL
COWHER, AND NATE BURLESON.

27
00:01:23,935 --> 00:01:27,324
AND WE WERE JUST LISTENING TO
WHAT TONY SAID, AND

28
00:01:27,324 --> 00:01:29,215
REALLY GOT
US THINKING.

29
00:01:29,215 --> 00:01:33,912
>> YEAH.
I'M REALIZING THAT AFTER THIS
GAME ENDS, THERE'S JUST NOTHING.

30
00:01:33,912 --> 00:01:38,668
>> WELL, WHAT ARE MEN SUPPOSED
TO DO ON SUNDAYS NOW?

31
00:01:38,668 --> 00:01:42,447
JUST GO TO THEIR FRIENDS' HOUSES
FOR NO REASON?

32
00:01:42,447 --> 00:01:44,841
>> WITHOUT FOOTBALL, WHAT ARE WE
GOING TO TALK ABOUT?

33
00:01:44,841 --> 00:01:48,586
I MEAN, DOES ANYONE HAVE
ANYTHING REMOTELY INTERESTING OR
INSIGHTFUL TO SAY?

34
00:01:48,586 --> 00:01:54,344
>> I WISH INSTEAD OF SALT, THE
OCEAN WAS FULL OF SUGAR.

35
00:01:55,771 --> 00:01:58,657
>> OH, JESUS.
WE'RE DOOMED.

36
00:01:58,757 --> 00:02:02,448
>> WELL, COME ON NOW.
DON'T FORGET WE STILL GOT THE
PRO BOWL COMING UP.

37
00:02:02,448 --> 00:02:06,738
>> JIM, I HAVE BEEN COVERING
FOOTBALL FOR 30 YEARS,

38
00:02:06,738 --> 00:02:09,533
AND I
HAVE NEVER ONCE WATCHED THE PRO
BOWL.

39
00:02:09,533 --> 00:02:14,552
>> YOU KNOW, THIS ISN'T JUST
ABOUT US.
AMERICA NEEDS FOOTBALL.

40
00:02:14,552 --> 00:02:17,000
IT'S THE ONLY THING EVERYONE
STILL WATCHES.

41
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,404
>> ESPECIALLY LIVE.

42
00:02:18,404 --> 00:02:23,899
THERE'S NO OTHER LIVE TV THAT'S
EVEN REMOTELY WATCHABLE.

43
00:02:23,899 --> 00:02:28,368
>> WELL, THANK GOD CBS STILL HAS
BLUE BLOODS,

44
00:02:28,368 --> 00:02:30,948
THE NUMBER ONE
DRAMA IN EVERY DENTIST OFFICE.

45
00:02:30,948 --> 00:02:33,444
>> "BLUE BLOODS" NOW IN ITS --

46
00:02:33,444 --> 00:02:36,099
WAIT, FINAL SEASON?

47
00:02:36,099 --> 00:02:38,834
NOW THEY'RE TAKING "BLUE BLOODS"
FROM US TOO?

48
00:02:38,834 --> 00:02:42,221
>> WHAT THE HELL ARE THEY EVEN
REPLACING IT WITH?

49
00:02:42,221 --> 00:02:45,890
>> OH, MY -- SO HELP ME TODD?

50
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:47,672
WHAT IS THAT?

51
00:02:47,672 --> 00:02:50,506
>> IT SOUNDS TODD DAMN AWFUL.

52
00:02:50,506 --> 00:02:53,202
PEOPLE ARE GETTING UPSET ABOUT
BARBIE GETTING STUBBED.

53
00:02:53,202 --> 00:02:56,424
WHAT ABOUT "YELLOWSTONE"?
ZERO EMMY NOMINATIONS?

54
00:02:56,424 --> 00:02:59,541
>> "YELLOWSTONE" IS OUR
BARBIE.

55
00:02:59,541 --> 00:03:04,897
AND I UNDERSTAND THAT MARGOT
ROBBIE GOT SNUBBED,

56
00:03:04,897 --> 00:03:06,861
I REALLY DO, BUT --

57
00:03:06,861 --> 00:03:08,314
I'M SORRY.

58
00:03:08,314 --> 00:03:12,045
BUT THEY'RE COMING AFTER
GOSLING?

59
00:03:12,675 --> 00:03:18,196
KEN WAS THE FIRST TIME I FELT
SEEN IN A MOVIE.

60
00:03:18,196 --> 00:03:21,438
>> ALL RIGHT.
GUYS, I THINK WE ALL NEED TO
JUST CALM DOWN, OKAY?

61
00:03:21,438 --> 00:03:24,093
LET'S GO TO TRACY WOLFSON WHO'S
STANDING ON THE SIDELINES

62
00:03:24,093 --> 00:03:26,521
WITH
KANSAS CITY CHIEFS HEAD COACH
ANDY REID.

63
00:03:26,521 --> 00:03:29,853
>> COACH REID, ARE YOU UPSET
ABOUT THE SEASON ENDING?

64
00:03:29,853 --> 00:03:35,091
>> WHY?
BECAUSE IT'S THE ONLY TIME I GET
TO HANG OUT WITH TAYLOR SWIFT

65
00:03:35,091 --> 00:03:37,765
AND NOW THAT'S OVER?

66
00:03:37,831 --> 00:03:40,608
I'M SORRY.
I NEED TO GO.

67
00:03:41,831 --> 00:03:46,306
>> GUYS, WHAT IS GOING ON?
CAN WE JUST DO OUR FINAL
PREDICTIONS?

68
00:03:46,306 --> 00:03:48,545
>> I PREDICT THAT PEOPLE WILL BE
SO DEPRESSED

69
00:03:48,545 --> 00:03:52,725
THAT DRY JANUARY
WILL GIVE WAY TO LIVER FAILURE
FEBRUARY.

70
00:03:53,521 --> 00:03:57,841
>> I PREDICT THAT ONE OF US WILL APPEAR

71
00:03:57,841 --> 00:04:00,514
IN A COMMERCIAL FOR PENIS
PILLS.

72
00:04:00,514 --> 00:04:03,868
BUT WE WON'T KNOW WHETHER THEY
MAKE YOUR PENIS

73
00:04:03,868 --> 00:04:06,473
LONGER, HARDER, STRAIGHTER,

74
00:04:06,473 --> 00:04:09,173
OR MAKE IT LOSE
WEIGHT.

75
00:04:09,173 --> 00:04:12,665
>> WELL, I PREDICT I'M GOING TO
CRY.

76
00:04:12,665 --> 00:04:15,686
BECAUSE I LOVE YOU GUYS SO DAMN
MUCH.

77
00:04:16,184 --> 00:04:20,000
>> I PREDICT RAVENS.

78
00:04:20,137 --> 00:04:22,807
>> YOU KNOW, I JUST REALIZED
SOMETHING.

79
00:04:22,807 --> 00:04:26,733
AFTER TODAY, WE MAY NOT HAVE
FOOTBALL, BUT WE STILL HAVE EACH
OTHER.

80
00:04:26,733 --> 00:04:29,597
TO QUOTE "FAST AND FURIOUS"
THREE THROUGH SEVEN,

81
00:04:29,662 --> 00:04:31,455
IT'S ABOUT FAMILY,

82
00:04:31,455 --> 00:04:34,060
AND NOT COUNTING MY WIFE
AND THREE KIDS,

83
00:04:34,121 --> 00:04:37,041
YOU GUYS ARE THE
ONLY FAMILY I GOT.

84
00:04:39,796 --> 00:04:46,591
* IT'LL BE A LONG DAY WITHOUT
YOU MY FRIENDS,

85
00:04:46,591 --> 00:04:52,478
AND I'LL TELL
YOU ALL ABOUT IT WHEN I SEE YOU
AGAIN *

86
00:04:52,478 --> 00:04:55,975
* I'LL PLAY SOME GOLF IN PHOENIX,

87
00:04:55,975 --> 00:04:59,037
MAYBE GET SOME GAMBLING IN,

88
00:04:59,037 --> 00:05:04,652
AND I'LL TELL YOU ALL ABOUT
IT WHEN THERE'S FOOTBALL AGAIN,

89
00:05:27,016 --> 00:05:31,717
>> AND LIVE FROM NEW YORK, IT'S
SATURDAY NIGHT!

90
00:07:37,592 --> 00:07:42,677
DAKOTA JOHNSON.

91
00:08:03,347 --> 00:08:08,862
>>> THANK YOU!
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

92
00:08:08,862 --> 00:08:13,345
IT IS SO GREAT TO BE BACK
HOSTING "SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE."

93
00:08:15,025 --> 00:08:19,524
THE LAST TIME I HOSTED WAS RIGHT
AFTER THE SNL 40th.

94
00:08:19,524 --> 00:08:22,289
I WAS ACTUALLY IN THE AUDIENCE
FOR THAT SPECIAL.

95
00:08:22,289 --> 00:08:24,645
LOOK AT THIS PHOTO.

96
00:08:25,974 --> 00:08:28,249
LOOK AT THIS COLLECTION OF
PEOPLE.

97
00:08:28,338 --> 00:08:31,224
SARAH PALIN, GEORGE LUCAS,
STEVEN SPIELBERG,

98
00:08:31,224 --> 00:08:34,410
AND LOOK WHO'S
SITTING RIGHT BEHIND ME.

99
00:08:36,273 --> 00:08:39,678
IT'S JUST CRAZY TO BE STANDING
SO CLOSE TO SOMEONE

100
00:08:39,678 --> 00:08:43,513
WHO WOULD
BECOME THE MOST POWERFUL PERSON
IN AMERICA.

101
00:08:48,809 --> 00:08:51,700
I HAVE A NEW MOVIE COMING OUT.

102
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:54,215
IT'S CALLED "MADAME WEB."

103
00:08:55,065 --> 00:09:00,794
IT IS IN THE MARVEL UNIVERSE,
AND IT ALSO STARS SYDNEY
SWEENEY.

104
00:09:00,794 --> 00:09:04,477
SO IT'S KIND OF LIKE IF AI

105
00:09:04,477 --> 00:09:07,606
GENERATED YOUR BOYFRIEND'S
PERFECT MOVIE.

106
00:09:07,606 --> 00:09:10,390
I'VE BEEN DOING A LOT OF PRESS FOR IT,

107
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:13,969
AND I'M JUST NOT GOOD AT
TALKING TO JOURNALISTS.

108
00:09:13,969 --> 00:09:16,697
I THINK THE BIG PROBLEM IS THAT

109
00:09:16,697 --> 00:09:20,411
I SAY STUFF, AND THEN THEY WRITE
IT DOWN.

110
00:09:20,427 --> 00:09:24,200
AND IT'S REALLY UNFAIR.

111
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:27,018
BECAUSE MOST OF THE TIME, I'M
JOKING.

112
00:09:27,018 --> 00:09:31,376
EVEN WHEN I WAS A KID, I DIDN'T
TAKE INTERVIEWS SERIOUSLY.

113
00:09:31,376 --> 00:09:35,342
LOOK AT ME ON THIS RED CARPET
WITH MY DAD WHEN I WAS 7.

114
00:09:35,342 --> 00:09:38,283
>> WELL, THEY'RE MY BIGGEST FANS,

115
00:09:38,283 --> 00:09:43,276
AND THE BEST BAROMETER
THAT I HAVE, AND THEY LOVE THE
SHOW.

116
00:09:48,555 --> 00:09:53,731
>> ANYWAY, I'M SO EXCITED TO BE
BACK AT SNL.

117
00:09:54,978 --> 00:10:00,931
IT'S ALSO A SORT OF REUNION FOR
ME AND JUSTIN TIMBERLAKE.

118
00:10:01,867 --> 00:10:06,487
WE WERE ACTUALLY IN A MOVIE
TOGETHER CALLED "THE SOCIAL
NETWORK."

119
00:10:15,368 --> 00:10:17,415
>> SHUT UP.

120
00:10:18,403 --> 00:10:20,847
I REMEMBER THOSE DAYS, DAKOTA.

121
00:10:20,847 --> 00:10:23,196
>> JUSTIN, WHAT ARE YOU DOING UP
HERE?
ARE YOU LOST?

122
00:10:23,196 --> 00:10:26,443
>> I HEARD MY NAME.
I THOUGHT THAT WAS MY CUE.

123
00:10:26,443 --> 00:10:30,057
>> OH, NO.
YOU'RE THE MUSICAL GUEST.

124
00:10:30,057 --> 00:10:32,555
>> OKAY.

125
00:10:32,555 --> 00:10:36,215
WELL, IF YOU WANT ME TO BE IN
SKETCHES, I HAVE --

126
00:10:39,085 --> 00:10:41,771
-- I'VE HOSTED BEFORE.

127
00:10:41,771 --> 00:10:43,593
FIVE

128
00:10:44,026 --> 00:10:47,986
>> YEAH.
WELL, THAT WAS TEN YEARS AGO,
SO.

129
00:10:49,286 --> 00:10:51,274
>> WAS IT THAT LONG?

130
00:10:51,274 --> 00:10:56,622
>> WELL, I MEAN, EITHER WAY, I'M
SO HAPPY YOU CHOSE MY SHOW FOR
YOUR COMEBACK.

131
00:11:00,922 --> 00:11:04,565
>> IT'S -- HMM, COMEBACK.
IS THAT WHAT WE'RE CALLING IT?

132
00:11:04,565 --> 00:11:07,247
>> YEAH.
COMEBACK IN A GOOD WAY.

133
00:11:07,247 --> 00:11:10,285
>> OKAY.
I SEE WHAT THIS IS.
THIS IS WHERE WE MAKE A JOKE LIKE

134
00:11:10,285 --> 00:11:14,053
FIRST HE WAS BRINGING SEXY
BACK, AND NOW HE'S BRINGING
COMING BACK.

135
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:18,605
>> I WOULDN'T PHRASE IT LIKE
THAT.

136
00:11:18,605 --> 00:11:22,452
>> WELL, YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.
NOW THAT I HEARD THAT OUTLOUD, THAT WAS --

137
00:11:22,452 --> 00:11:25,519
SORRY.
ANYWAYS, JUST WANTED TO SAY GOOD LUCK,

138
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:27,572
>> THANK YOU.
- AND YOU'RE GOING TO CRUSH
IT.

139
00:11:27,572 --> 00:11:30,930
>> AND I'M HERE IF YOU NEED ME.
>> OKAY.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

140
00:11:30,930 --> 00:11:32,882
>> ARE WE DOING IT?

141
00:11:44,908 --> 00:11:49,320
I'M HERE TO SAY BREAK A LEG.

142
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,286
>> OKAY.
>> THESE ARE MY NORMAL CLOTHES.

143
00:11:51,286 --> 00:11:53,216
BREAK A LEG.

144
00:11:58,101 --> 00:12:01,047
>> BEFORE WE START, I JUST WANT TO SAY

145
00:12:01,047 --> 00:12:05,380
THIS IS MY FAVORITE PLACE
TO BE, AND I'M SO GRATEFUL TO BE
HERE.

146
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:09,762
WE HAVE GOT A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU
TONIGHT.
JUSTIN TIMBERLAKE IS HERE.

147
00:12:09,762 --> 00:12:12,780
STICK AROUND
WE|LL BE BACK

148
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:31,084
IT'S LIKE A MINI MASON FAMILY

149

00:27:35,923 --> 00:27:39,215
>> WHAT?
>> NOT HOW I EXPECTED YOU TO
COME IN HERE.

469
00:27:39,215 --> 00:27:41,996
MUST BE THAT DRY SENSE OF HUMOR.

470
00:27:41,996 --> 00:27:43,797
WE HAD AN IDEA FOR YOU.

471
00:27:43,797 --> 00:27:48,455
>> YEAH.
BASICALLY, ONE OF US WOULD PLAY
YOUR BOYFRIEND AND --

472
00:27:48,455 --> 00:27:51,765
>> SORRY.
THAT'S THE FIRST FUNNY THING
YOU'VE EVER SAID.

473

>> THAT WASN'T A JOKE.

474
00:27:53,342 --> 00:27:55,756
>> SO IS IT LIKE A MAKE-A-WISH
THING?

475
00:27:55,756 --> 00:27:57,919
DOES MY CHARACTER HAVE BRAIN
DAMAGE?

476
00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:00,275
>> DID WE DO SOMETHING TO OFFEND
YOU?

477
00:28:00,275 --> 00:28:04,905
>> NO.
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO MEET THE
LONELIER ISLAND.

478
00:28:04,905 --> 00:28:08,564
>> ALL RIGHT.
LET'S DO IT THEN.

WEB."

481
00:28:13,714 --> 00:28:16,389
CAN YOU INTRODUCE ME TO SYDNEY
SWEENEY?

483
00:28:20,018 --> 00:28:24,616
>> HOW DOES IT FEEL TO BE IN THE
LEAST VIRAL TAYLOR SWIFT VIDEO
SHE'S HAD?

484
00:28:24,616 --> 00:28:26,828
>> DO YOU STILL HAVE TO AUDITION, 

485
00:28:26,828 --> 00:28:30,328
OR DO THEY GIVE YOU
THE PART AS SOON AS AUBREY PLAZA
SAYS NO.

486
00:28:30,329 --> 00:28:32,157
HOW

487

>> HEY, I LOVE THAT YOU'RE STILL
DOING BANGS.
VERY OBAMA FIRST TERM.

492
00:28:43,967 --> 00:28:47,078
>> THAT'S ALMOST AS FUNNY AS THE
MOVIE YOU MADE THAT NO ONE SAW.

493
00:28:47,078 --> 00:28:50,399
>> MORE PEOPLE SAW IT THAN
DADDIO.

494
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:52,529
>> IS "DADDIO" WHO YOU CALLED TO
GET YOUR JOB.

495
00:28:52,529 --> 00:28:56,371
>> YOU WANT TO DO THE PARENT
THING?

>> I DON'T KNOW WHY WE'RE
INSULTING EACH OTHER.

500
00:29:08,270 --> 00:29:11,828
I'M GENERALLY A BIG FAN OF
YOURS.
I LOVED BIGGER SPLASH.

501
00:29:11,828 --> 00:29:15,596
- YEAH?

MAKE IN THE BOX OFFICE?

502
00:29:15,596 --> 00:29:17,559
>> LET'S GO!

503
00:29:17,559 --> 00:29:22,459
>> WHAT'S IT LIKE LOOKING LIKE

MOVIE'S 40% ON ROTTEN TOMATOES.

510
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:40,517

CARDS SO YOU SAY THE N WORD
DURING YOUR MONOLOGUE.

511
00:29:44,221 --> 00:29:46,297
I'M SO SORRY ABOUT THAT.

512

00:39:27,026 --> 00:39:31,609
TO PAY WRITER E.
JEAN CAROL $83.3 MILLION,

803
00:39:31,609 --> 00:39:34,189
AND
TRUMP IS A BILLIONAIRE,

804
00:39:34,189 --> 00:39:38,957
SO
OBVIOUSLY HE IMMEDIATELY HIT UP
YOUR GRANDMA FOR FIVE BUCKS.

805
00:39:38,957 --> 00:39:42,770
THEY ORDERED TRUMP TO PAY
$83 MILLION.

806
00:39:42,770 --> 00:39:44,569
THAT'S HOW UNLIKABLE HE IS.

807
00:39:44,569 --> 00:39:50,733
O.J. SIMPSON ONLY HAD TO PAY 33
MILLION FOR A DOUBLE MURDER.

808
00:39:50,733 --> 00:39:52,096
EVEN

809
00:39:52,096 --> 00:39:54,281
>> OKAY.
WELL.

810
00:39:57,664 --> 00:40:00,549
THIS TRIAL MUST HAVE DRIVEN
TRUMP CRAZY.

811
00:40:00,549 --> 00:40:02,431
THE JUDGE KEPT TELLING HIM TO
SHUT UP.

812
00:40:02,431 --> 00:40:05,271
THE JURY MADE HIM PAY TRIPLE
WHAT THE VICTIM ASKED FOR.

813
00:40:05,271 --> 00:40:08,915
EVEN THE COURTROOM SKETCH ARTIST
MADE HIM LOOK --

814
00:40:08,915 --> 00:40:14,753
MADE HIM LOOK
LIKE THAT LADY WHO GOT HER FACE
RIPPED OFF BY A MONKEY.

815
00:40:15,165 --> 00:40:19,261
THE ONLY WAY THIS COULD'VE GONE
WORSE FOR TRUMP IS IF THEY TOOK
AWAY HIS BUSINESSES,

816
00:40:19,261 --> 00:40:22,597
WHICH IS OF
COURSE WHAT HAPPENS IN NEXT
WEEK'S TRIAL.

817
00:40:23,193 --> 00:40:26,106
>> AFTER RON DeSANTIS ENDORSED TRUMP,

818
00:40:26,106 --> 00:40:28,788
HE CALLED DeSANTIS A
REALLY TERRIFIC PERSON.

819
00:40:28,788 --> 00:40:32,129
STOP CALLING

820
00:40:32,129 --> 00:40:34,844
WELL, IT'S LIKE A WISE MAN ONCE
SAID.

821
00:40:34,944 --> 00:40:39,571
>> YOU CAN BE THE MOST WORTHLESS
REPUBLICAN IN AMERICA,

822
00:40:39,571 --> 00:40:43,172
BUT IF
YOU KISS THE RING, HE'LL SAY
YOU'RE WONDERFUL.

823
00:40:43,172 --> 00:40:44,935
>> WELL.

824
00:40:44,935 --> 00:40:49,201
AFTER THE NEW HAMPSHIRE PRIMARY,
NIKKI HALEY ATTACKED DONALD TRUMP

825
00:40:49,201 --> 00:40:51,484
AND CALLED OUT HIS, QUOTE,
SENIOR MOMENTS,

826
00:40:51,484 --> 00:40:53,218
WHICH MADE TRUMP
SO ANGRY,

827
00:40:53,218 --> 00:40:56,866
HE ALMOST RIPPED OFF
THE SAFETY RAILS ON HIS TOILET.

828
00:40:59,884 --> 00:41:02,864
ALSO CALLED TOTALLY UNHINGED

829
00:41:02,864 --> 00:41:05,888
AND CALLED FOR HIM TO TAKE A MENTAL COMPETENCY
TEST,

830
00:41:05,888 --> 00:41:10,244
AND HERE'S SOME FOOTAGE OF
TRUMP TRYING TO BUZZ IN WITH HIS
ANSWERS.

831
00:41:14,591 --> 00:41:17,540
>> SEE.
HE'S FINE.
HASN'T LOST A STEP.

832
00:41:17,540 --> 00:41:21,450
TRUMP DID HAVE A SLIGHT STUMBLE
THIS WEEK WHILE TALKING ABOUT BANKS,

833
00:41:21,450 --> 00:41:24,433
AND HE INTRODUCED A NEW
TERM CALLED DEBANK.

834
00:41:24,433 --> 00:41:27,288
>> WE'RE GOING TO PAY STRONG
PROTECTIONS

835
00:41:27,288 --> 00:41:31,480
TO STOP BANKS AND
REGULATORS FROM TRYING TO DEBANK
YOU.

836
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:34,988
THEY'RE GOING TO DEBANK YOU, AND
WE'RE GOING TO DEBANK --

837
00:41:35,710 --> 00:41:38,646
DEBANK MEANS,

838
00:41:38,646 --> 00:41:43,408
BUT HE MIGHT HAVE TO TAKE D AMBULANCE TO SEE D
DOCTOR.

839
00:41:46,775 --> 00:41:50,532
TO SEND THE DIRECTOR OF THE CIA

840
00:41:50,532 --> 00:41:53,083
TO BROKER A DEAL BETWEEN ISRAEL AND HAMAS

841
00:41:53,083 --> 00:41:57,648
BECAUSE NO ONE EASES
TENSIONS IN THE MIDDLE EAST
QUITE LIKE THE CIA.

842
00:41:57,648 --> 00:42:01,896
THEY'RE LIKE THE DRAYMOND GREEN
OF PEACEFUL SOLUTIONS.

843
00:42:01,896 --> 00:42:06,220
REPORT SHOWS THAT SINCE THE ABORTION BAN TOOK
EFFECT IN TEXAS,

844
00:42:06,220 --> 00:42:11,108
THE NUMBER OF
TEENAGERS GIVING BIRTH IN THE
STATE ROSE FOR 15 YEARS,

845
00:42:11,193 --> 00:42:14,602
WHICH
IS GREAT NEWS FOR MY NEW STORE,

846
00:42:14,602 --> 00:42:17,874
MICHAEL CHE'S MATERNITY PROM
DRESSES.

847
00:42:21,694 --> 00:42:23,851
I LIKE THIS CROWD.

848
00:42:24,755 --> 00:42:29,449
>> LILY GRADSTONE IS THE FIRST

849
00:42:18,838 --> 00:42:29,449
NATIVE AMERICAN WOMAN TO BE

850
00:42:29,449 --> 00:42:31,196
NOMINATED FOR BEST ACTRESS.

851
00:42:32,870 --> 00:42:37,237
THAT'S RIGHT.
IT'S A HISTORIC MOMENT.
HER FELLOW NOMINEES ARE CALLING IT,

852
00:42:37,237 --> 00:42:39,836
PLEASE DON'T LET US WIN.

853
00:42:42,977 --> 00:42:48,320
GLADSTONE'S NOMINATION COMES
AFTER SEVERAL NATIVE AMERICAN
ACTORS WERE SNUBBED IN THE PAST,

854
00:42:48,385 --> 00:42:51,655
INCLUDING JOHNNY DEPP IN LONE
RANGER.

855
00:42:52,845 --> 00:42:56,081
>> THE JAPANESE MOVIE GODZILLA MINUS ONE

856
00:42:56,081 --> 00:42:59,627
RECEIVED A SURPRISE
OSCAR NOMINATION FOR VISUAL
EFFECTS.

857
00:42:59,627 --> 00:43:04,367
ALSO, THE GODZILLA PREQUEL,
OPPENHEIMER.

858
00:43:09,284 --> 00:43:12,910
>> SPIRIT AIRLINES SHARES HAVE
FALLEN 58%

859
00:43:12,910 --> 00:43:16,120
AFTER A FEDERAL JUDGE
BLOCKED A MERGER WITH JET BLUE.

860
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:18,966
SO NOW THE ONLY WAY SPIRIT AND
JET BLUE WILL MERGE

861
00:43:18,966 --> 00:43:20,768
IS MIDAIR.

862
00:43:25,589 --> 00:43:31,711
CRITICS HAVE BEEN BREAKING DOWN

863
00:43:27,474 --> 00:43:31,711
THE FIRST TIME NOMINEES AND

864
00:43:27,474 --> 00:43:31,711
SURPRISE SNUBS.

865
00:43:31,711 --> 00:43:36,082
HERE TO COMMENT IS A GUY NAMED

866
00:43:31,711 --> 00:43:36,082
ETHAN.

867
00:43:31,711 --> 00:43:36,082
>> HEY, EVERYONE!

868
00:43:36,082 --> 00:43:38,985
HEY, COLIN.

869
00:43:36,082 --> 00:43:38,985
THANKS SO MUCH FOR HAVING ME.

870
00:43:36,082 --> 00:43:38,985
I'M ETHAN.

871
00:43:38,985 --> 00:43:45,625
>> HI, ETHAN.

872
00:43:38,985 --> 00:43:45,625
SO DO YOU WORK FOR THE OSCARS OR

873
00:43:45,625 --> 00:43:47,360
SOMETHING?

874
00:43:45,625 --> 00:43:47,360
>> NO.

875
00:43:45,625 --> 00:43:47,360
I COULD.

876
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:54,100
BUT I ACTUALLY STARTED MY OWN

877
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:54,100
AWARDS SHOW FOR MOVIES THAT

878
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:54,100
REALLY AMUSED ME, ETHAN.

879
00:43:54,100 --> 00:44:01,908
I'M EXCITED TO ANNOUNCE THIS

880
00:43:54,100 --> 00:44:01,908
YEAR'S NOMINEES FOR BEST

881
00:43:54,100 --> 00:44:01,908
PERFORMANCE THAT REMINDED ME

882
00:44:01,908 --> 00:44:09,082
FROM MOMENTS OF ETHAN'S PAST.

883
00:44:01,908 --> 00:44:09,082
THE MOMENTS ARE BRADLEY COOPER

884
00:44:01,908 --> 00:44:09,082
MARRYING A WOMAN, MAESTRO, BEEN

885
00:44:09,082 --> 00:44:11,851
THERE.

886
00:44:09,082 --> 00:44:11,851
PAUL'S EYE CONDITION, THE

887
00:44:09,082 --> 00:44:11,851
HOLDOVERS, BEEN THERE.

888
00:44:11,851 --> 00:44:17,957
AND FINALLY, THE CHICKENS

889
00:44:11,851 --> 00:44:17,957
BUILDING A FORT, CHICKEN RUN,

890
00:44:11,851 --> 00:44:17,957
DONNA THE NUGGET.

891
00:44:17,957 --> 00:44:21,294
I AIN'T NO CHICKEN, BUT I'VE

892
00:44:17,957 --> 00:44:21,294
BEEN THERE.

893
00:44:17,957 --> 00:44:21,294
>> YOU'VE BEEN THERE?

894
00:44:21,294 --> 00:44:25,331
I'M SORRY.

895
00:44:21,294 --> 00:44:25,331
THAT AWARD DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

896
00:44:21,294 --> 00:44:25,331
>> I KNOW.

897
00:44:25,331 --> 00:44:28,501
THERE'S SOME SERIOUS SNUBS.

898
00:44:25,331 --> 00:44:28,501
I'M SO OFFENDED.

899
00:44:25,331 --> 00:44:28,501
>> WAIT.

900
00:44:28,501 --> 00:44:32,906
YOU'RE OFFENDED?

901
00:44:28,501 --> 00:44:32,906
DON'T YOU CHOOSE WHO GETS

902
00:44:28,501 --> 00:44:32,906
NOMINATED AT THE ETHANS?

903
00:44:32,906 --> 00:44:37,243
>> YEAH.

904
00:44:32,906 --> 00:44:37,243
IT'S A REAL PROBLEM.

905
00:44:32,906 --> 00:44:37,243
THE LACK OF DIVERSITY.

906
00:44:37,243 --> 00:44:43,950
THE ACADEMY IS 100% ASIAN.

907
00:44:37,243 --> 00:44:43,950
THAT'S WHY I'M ASKING EVERYONE

908
00:44:37,243 --> 00:44:43,950

YOU WANT PEOPLE TO DONATE TO

912
00:44:52,859 --> 00:44:56,496
WHAT?

00:44:52,859 --> 00:44:56,496
WHO'S IN THE ACADEMY FOR THE

914
00:44:52,859 --> 00:44:56,496
ETHANS?

915
00:44:56,496 --> 00:45:01,267
>> HERE'S A PHOTO FROM THE ETHAN

916
00:44:56,496 --> 00:45:01,267
ACADEMY'S LAST MEETING.

917

919
00:45:01,267 --> 00:45:04,204
NO.

920
00:45:01,267 --> 00:45:04,204
I'M ONLY 15.

921
00:45:04,204 --> 00:45:07,707
>> I DON'T BELIEVE YOU.

922
00:45:04,204 --> 00:45:07,707
>> WELL, FINE.

923
00:45:04,204 --> 00:45:07,707
I WAS BORN ON LEAP DAY, SO I'M

924
00:45:07,707 --> 00:45:14,347
ACTUALLY 60.

925
00:45:07,707 --> 00:45:14,347
>> OKAY.

926
00:45:07,707 --> 00:45:14,347
>> ASIAN DON'T RAISIN.

927
00:45:14,347 --> 00:45:23,456
RIGHT, COLIN?

928
00:45:14,347 --> 00:45:23,456
>> ANYWAY.

929
00:45:14,347 --> 00:45:23,456
WHAT DO A LOT OF THE ETHAN

930
00:45:23,456 --> 00:45:26,559
AWARDS AT LEAST GO TO ASIAN

931
00:45:23,456 --> 00:45:26,559
PEOPLE?

932
00:45:23,456 --> 00:45:26,559
>> NO!

933
00:45:26,559 --> 00:45:30,697
I GET TOO JEALOUS WHEN ANY OF

934
00:45:26,559 --> 00:45:30,697
THEM WIN ANYTHING.

935
00:45:26,559 --> 00:45:30,697
IT'S A REAL PROBLEM.

936
00:45:30,697 --> 00:45:35,068
>> OKAY.

937
00:45:30,697 --> 00:45:35,068
THAT'S REALLY TOO BAD.

938
00:45:30,697 --> 00:45:35,068
>> BUT THE ETHANS HAVE A NEW

00:45:35,068 --> 00:45:40,206
CATEGORY THIS YEAR, SUPER

940

EXCITING, ETHAN, I, WILL BE

941
00:45:35,068 --> 00:45:40,206
HANDING OUT THE AWARD FOR MOVIE

942
00:45:40,206 --> 00:45:48,214
MOMENT THAT MADE ETHAN SAY,

943
00:45:40,206 --> 00:45:48,214
OKAY, WAIT, WHAT, NICE.

944
00:45:40,206 --> 00:45:48,214

THAT CATEGORY EITHER.

953
00:46:00,660 --> 00:46:03,897

THE OSCARS, COLIN?

955
00:46:03,897 --> 00:46:06,566

00:46:18,678 --> 00:46:20,814
OKAY.

962

NOTHING THEY CAN DO ABOUT THE
PEOPLE LOOTED FROM GHANA.

>> WELL, UNFORTUNATELY, NO.

1153
00:53:36,616 --> 00:53:42,589
MY MIND'S BEEN A LITTLE BIT

1154
00:53:36,616 --> 00:53:42,589

LITTLE BIT CRAZY.

1164
00:53:54,401 --> 00:54:01,174
SINCE I GOT THE CALL.

1165
00:54:01,174 --> 00:54:14,921

00:54:20,694 --> 00:54:25,165
GOING TO BE QUITE DIFFERENT.

1173
00:54:20,694 --> 00:54:25,165
THE POWER STRUCTURE IN THIS

I'M OKAY.

1183
00:54:44,351 --> 00:54:50,557
BUT IF EVERYONE STARTS ASKING IF

1184
00:54:44,351 --> 00:54:50,557
I'M OKAY, I MIGHT START CRYING.

1185
00:54:44,351 --> 00:54:50,557

1191
00:54:55,862 --> 00:55:02,602
SAYS THAT ON IT?

1192
00:55:02,602 --> 00:55:07,107
>> HUH, BINGO.

1193
00:55:02,602 --> 00:55:07,107
SHE MIGHT BE UGLY, BUT SHE'S

1201
00:55:21,087 --> 00:55:25,525

01:04:01,041 --> 01:04:06,212
IS THE DIARY ENTRY NOT ENOUGH?

1439

1441
01:04:06,212 --> 01:04:12,152
THAT DIARY COULD HAVE FLOWN UP

1442
01:04:06,212 --> 01:04:12,152
OUT OF YOUR BAG, STOPPED, AND

1443
01:04:06,212 --> 01:04:12,152
THEN DOWN INTO ANOTHER.

CAN YOU BE MORE SPECIFICALLY?

1451
01:04:19,659 --> 01:04:28,134

DIARRHEA AS USUAL.

1456
