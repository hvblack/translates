1
00:00:02,189 --> 00:00:06,360
>>> YOU'RE WATCHING THE AFC
CHAMPIONSHIP ON CBS.

2
00:00:09,584 --> 00:00:12,263
>> HELLO EVERYONE WELCOME TO THE
AFC CHAMPIONSHIP

3
00:00:12,263 --> 00:00:14,606
BETWEEN THE
BALTIMORE RAVENS AND THE KANSAS
CITY CHIEFS.

4
00:00:14,606 --> 00:00:16,738
I'M JIM NANTZ ALONGSIDE TONY
ROMO.

5
00:00:16,739 --> 00:00:19,048
SHOUTOUT

6
00:00:19,048 --> 00:00:20,947
DO YOU LOVE TO SHAKE, RATTLE,
AND ROLL?

7
00:00:20,947 --> 00:00:25,220
BECAUSE YOU'LL DO ALL THREE ON A
BOEING MAX 739.

8
00:00:25,221 --> 00:00:29,444
CAUSE

9
00:00:29,444 --> 00:00:31,687
ARE YOU EXCITED FOR TODAY'S
MATCHUP?

10
00:00:31,687 --> 00:00:32,910
>> WITHOUT A DOUBT, JIM.

11
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:36,973
WE'VE GOT TWO GENERATIONAL
TALENTS AT QUARTERBACK, TWO
ELITE DEFENSES.

12
00:00:36,973 --> 00:00:40,019
I EXPECT IT TO BE AN ALL-OUT
BATTLE FOR THE NEXT THREE HOURS.

13
00:00:40,019 --> 00:00:43,391
AND AFTER THAT, IT'S ALL OVER.

14
00:00:43,391 --> 00:00:45,748
>> ALL OVER?
>> FOOTBALL.

15
00:00:45,748 --> 00:00:50,063
AFTER TODAY, IT'S JUST -- IT'S
DONE.

16
00:00:50,063 --> 00:00:52,126
>> WELL, THERE'S STILL THE SUPER
BOWL.

17
00:00:52,126 --> 00:00:54,388
>> YEAH, BUT THAT'S NOT REAL
FOOTBALL.

18
00:00:54,388 --> 00:00:57,346
SUPER BOWL IS FOR COMMERCIALS AND USHER

19
00:00:57,346 --> 00:01:02,037
AND PEOPLE WHO NEVER
WATCH FOOTBALL ASKING HOW MANY
POINTS A TOUCHDOWN IS WORTH.

20
00:01:02,099 --> 00:01:07,000
TODAY'S THE LAST REAL FOOTBALL
DAY FOR JUST US GUYS.

21
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,183
>> TONY, ARE YOU OKAY, BUD?

22
00:01:10,183 --> 00:01:12,367
>> NAH, NOT REALLY.

23
00:01:12,367 --> 00:01:16,386
>> ALL RIGHT.
WELL, LET'S THROW IT OVER TO
JAMES BROWN AND OUR HALF TIME CREW

24
00:01:16,386 --> 00:01:18,135
FOR A SNEAK PEEK AT WHAT'S
AHEAD.

25
00:01:18,135 --> 00:01:21,289
>> THANKS, JIM.
I'M HERE WITH PHIL SIMMS,

26
00:01:21,289 --> 00:01:23,935
BILL
COWHER, AND NATE BURLESON.

27
00:01:23,935 --> 00:01:27,324
AND WE WERE JUST LISTENING TO
WHAT TONY SAID, AND

28
00:01:27,324 --> 00:01:29,215
REALLY GOT
US THINKING.

29
00:01:29,215 --> 00:01:33,912
>> YEAH.
I'M REALIZING THAT AFTER THIS
GAME ENDS, THERE'S JUST NOTHING.

30
00:01:33,912 --> 00:01:38,668
>> WELL, WHAT ARE MEN SUPPOSED
TO DO ON SUNDAYS NOW?

31
00:01:38,668 --> 00:01:42,447
JUST GO TO THEIR FRIENDS' HOUSES
FOR NO REASON?

32
00:01:42,447 --> 00:01:44,841
>> WITHOUT FOOTBALL, WHAT ARE WE
GOING TO TALK ABOUT?

33
00:01:44,841 --> 00:01:48,586
I MEAN, DOES ANYONE HAVE
ANYTHING REMOTELY INTERESTING OR
INSIGHTFUL TO SAY?

34
00:01:48,586 --> 00:01:54,344
>> I WISH INSTEAD OF SALT, THE
OCEAN WAS FULL OF SUGAR.

35
00:01:55,771 --> 00:01:58,657
>> OH, JESUS.
WE'RE DOOMED.

36
00:01:58,757 --> 00:02:02,448
>> WELL, COME ON NOW.
DON'T FORGET WE STILL GOT THE
PRO BOWL COMING UP.

37
00:02:02,448 --> 00:02:06,738
>> JIM, I HAVE BEEN COVERING
FOOTBALL FOR 30 YEARS,

38
00:02:06,738 --> 00:02:09,533
AND I
HAVE NEVER ONCE WATCHED THE PRO
BOWL.

39
00:02:09,533 --> 00:02:14,552
>> YOU KNOW, THIS ISN'T JUST
ABOUT US.
AMERICA NEEDS FOOTBALL.

40
00:02:14,552 --> 00:02:17,000
IT'S THE ONLY THING EVERYONE
STILL WATCHES.

41
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,404
>> ESPECIALLY LIVE.

42
00:02:18,404 --> 00:02:23,899
THERE'S NO OTHER LIVE TV THAT'S
EVEN REMOTELY WATCHABLE.

43
00:02:23,899 --> 00:02:28,368
>> WELL, THANK GOD CBS STILL HAS
BLUE BLOODS,

44
00:02:28,368 --> 00:02:30,948
THE NUMBER ONE
DRAMA IN EVERY DENTIST OFFICE.

45
00:02:30,948 --> 00:02:33,444
>> "BLUE BLOODS" NOW IN ITS --

46
00:02:33,444 --> 00:02:36,099
WAIT, FINAL SEASON?

47
00:02:36,099 --> 00:02:38,834
NOW THEY'RE TAKING "BLUE BLOODS"
FROM US TOO?

48
00:02:38,834 --> 00:02:42,221
>> WHAT THE HELL ARE THEY EVEN
REPLACING IT WITH?

49
00:02:42,221 --> 00:02:45,890
>> OH, MY -- SO HELP ME TODD?

50
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:47,672
WHAT IS THAT?

51
00:02:47,672 --> 00:02:50,506
>> IT SOUNDS TODD DAMN AWFUL.

52
00:02:50,506 --> 00:02:53,202
PEOPLE ARE GETTING UPSET ABOUT
BARBIE GETTING STUBBED.

53
00:02:53,202 --> 00:02:56,424
WHAT ABOUT "YELLOWSTONE"?
ZERO EMMY NOMINATIONS?

54
00:02:56,424 --> 00:02:59,541
>> "YELLOWSTONE" IS OUR
BARBIE.

55
00:02:59,541 --> 00:03:04,897
AND I UNDERSTAND THAT MARGOT
ROBBIE GOT SNUBBED,

56
00:03:04,897 --> 00:03:06,861
I REALLY DO, BUT --

57
00:03:06,861 --> 00:03:08,314
I'M SORRY.

58
00:03:08,314 --> 00:03:12,045
BUT THEY'RE COMING AFTER
GOSLING?

59
00:03:12,675 --> 00:03:18,196
KEN WAS THE FIRST TIME I FELT
SEEN IN A MOVIE.

60
00:03:18,196 --> 00:03:21,438
>> ALL RIGHT.
GUYS, I THINK WE ALL NEED TO
JUST CALM DOWN, OKAY?

61
00:03:21,438 --> 00:03:24,093
LET'S GO TO TRACY WOLFSON WHO'S
STANDING ON THE SIDELINES

62
00:03:24,093 --> 00:03:26,521
WITH
KANSAS CITY CHIEFS HEAD COACH
ANDY REID.

63
00:03:26,521 --> 00:03:29,853
>> COACH REID, ARE YOU UPSET
ABOUT THE SEASON ENDING?

64
00:03:29,853 --> 00:03:35,091
>> WHY?
BECAUSE IT'S THE ONLY TIME I GET
TO HANG OUT WITH TAYLOR SWIFT

65
00:03:35,091 --> 00:03:37,765
AND NOW THAT'S OVER?

66
00:03:37,831 --> 00:03:40,608
I'M SORRY.
I NEED TO GO.

67
00:03:41,831 --> 00:03:46,306
>> GUYS, WHAT IS GOING ON?
CAN WE JUST DO OUR FINAL
PREDICTIONS?

68
00:03:46,306 --> 00:03:48,545
>> I PREDICT THAT PEOPLE WILL BE
SO DEPRESSED

69
00:03:48,545 --> 00:03:52,725
THAT DRY JANUARY
WILL GIVE WAY TO LIVER FAILURE
FEBRUARY.

70
00:03:53,521 --> 00:03:57,841
>> I PREDICT THAT ONE OF US WILL APPEAR

71
00:03:57,841 --> 00:04:00,514
IN A COMMERCIAL FOR PENIS
PILLS.

72
00:04:00,514 --> 00:04:03,868
BUT WE WON'T KNOW WHETHER THEY
MAKE YOUR PENIS

73
00:04:03,868 --> 00:04:06,473
LONGER, HARDER, STRAIGHTER,

74
00:04:06,473 --> 00:04:09,173
OR MAKE IT LOSE
WEIGHT.

75
00:04:09,173 --> 00:04:12,665
>> WELL, I PREDICT I'M GOING TO
CRY.

76
00:04:12,665 --> 00:04:15,686
BECAUSE I LOVE YOU GUYS SO DAMN
MUCH.

77
00:04:16,184 --> 00:04:20,000
>> I PREDICT RAVENS.

78
00:04:20,137 --> 00:04:22,807
>> YOU KNOW, I JUST REALIZED
SOMETHING.

79
00:04:22,807 --> 00:04:26,733
AFTER TODAY, WE MAY NOT HAVE
FOOTBALL, BUT WE STILL HAVE EACH
OTHER.

80
00:04:26,733 --> 00:04:29,597
TO QUOTE "FAST AND FURIOUS"
THREE THROUGH SEVEN,

81
00:04:29,662 --> 00:04:31,455
IT'S ABOUT FAMILY,

82
00:04:31,455 --> 00:04:34,060
AND NOT COUNTING MY WIFE
AND THREE KIDS,

83
00:04:34,121 --> 00:04:37,041
YOU GUYS ARE THE
ONLY FAMILY I GOT.

84
00:04:39,796 --> 00:04:46,591
* IT'LL BE A LONG DAY WITHOUT
YOU MY FRIENDS,

85
00:04:46,591 --> 00:04:52,478
AND I'LL TELL
YOU ALL ABOUT IT WHEN I SEE YOU
AGAIN *

86
00:04:52,478 --> 00:04:55,975
* I'LL PLAY SOME GOLF IN PHOENIX,

87
00:04:55,975 --> 00:04:59,037
MAYBE GET SOME GAMBLING IN,

88
00:04:59,037 --> 00:05:04,652
AND I'LL TELL YOU ALL ABOUT
IT WHEN THERE'S FOOTBALL AGAIN,

89
00:05:27,016 --> 00:05:31,717
>> AND LIVE FROM NEW YORK, IT'S
SATURDAY NIGHT!

90
00:07:37,592 --> 00:07:42,677
DAKOTA JOHNSON.

91
00:08:03,347 --> 00:08:08,862
>>> THANK YOU!
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

92
00:08:08,862 --> 00:08:13,345
IT IS SO GREAT TO BE BACK
HOSTING "SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE."

93
00:08:15,025 --> 00:08:19,524
THE LAST TIME I HOSTED WAS RIGHT
AFTER THE SNL 40th.

94
00:08:19,524 --> 00:08:22,289
I WAS ACTUALLY IN THE AUDIENCE
FOR THAT SPECIAL.

95
00:08:22,289 --> 00:08:24,645
LOOK AT THIS PHOTO.

96
00:08:25,974 --> 00:08:28,249
LOOK AT THIS COLLECTION OF
PEOPLE.

97
00:08:28,338 --> 00:08:31,224
SARAH PALIN, GEORGE LUCAS,
STEVEN SPIELBERG,

98
00:08:31,224 --> 00:08:34,410
AND LOOK WHO'S
SITTING RIGHT BEHIND ME.

99
00:08:36,273 --> 00:08:39,678
IT'S JUST CRAZY TO BE STANDING
SO CLOSE TO SOMEONE

100
00:08:39,678 --> 00:08:43,513
WHO WOULD
BECOME THE MOST POWERFUL PERSON
IN AMERICA.

101
00:08:48,809 --> 00:08:51,700
I HAVE A NEW MOVIE COMING OUT.

102
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:54,215
IT'S CALLED "MADAME WEB."

103
00:08:55,065 --> 00:09:00,794
IT IS IN THE MARVEL UNIVERSE,
AND IT ALSO STARS SYDNEY
SWEENEY.

104
00:09:00,794 --> 00:09:04,477
SO IT'S KIND OF LIKE IF AI

105
00:09:04,477 --> 00:09:07,606
GENERATED YOUR BOYFRIEND'S
PERFECT MOVIE.

106
00:09:07,606 --> 00:09:10,390
I'VE BEEN DOING A LOT OF PRESS FOR IT, 

107
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:13,969
AND I'M JUST NOT GOOD AT
TALKING TO JOURNALISTS.

108
00:09:13,969 --> 00:09:16,697
I THINK THE BIG PROBLEM IS THAT

109
00:09:16,697 --> 00:09:20,411
I SAY STUFF, AND THEN THEY WRITE
IT DOWN.

110
00:09:20,427 --> 00:09:24,200
AND IT'S REALLY UNFAIR.

111
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:27,018
BECAUSE MOST OF THE TIME, I'M
JOKING.

112
00:09:27,018 --> 00:09:31,376
EVEN WHEN I WAS A KID, I DIDN'T
TAKE INTERVIEWS SERIOUSLY.

113
00:09:31,376 --> 00:09:35,342
LOOK AT ME ON THIS RED CARPET
WITH MY DAD WHEN I WAS 7.

114
00:09:35,342 --> 00:09:38,283
>> WELL, THEY'RE MY BIGGEST FANS, 

115
00:09:38,283 --> 00:09:43,276
AND THE BEST BAROMETER
THAT I HAVE, AND THEY LOVE THE
SHOW.

116
00:09:48,555 --> 00:09:53,731
>> ANYWAY, I'M SO EXCITED TO BE
BACK AT SNL.

117
00:09:54,978 --> 00:10:00,931
IT'S ALSO A SORT OF REUNION FOR
ME AND JUSTIN TIMBERLAKE.

118
00:10:01,867 --> 00:10:06,487
WE WERE ACTUALLY IN A MOVIE
TOGETHER CALLED "THE SOCIAL
NETWORK."

119
00:10:15,368 --> 00:10:17,415
>> SHUT UP.

120
00:10:18,403 --> 00:10:20,847
I REMEMBER THOSE DAYS, DAKOTA.

121
00:10:20,847 --> 00:10:23,196
>> JUSTIN, WHAT ARE YOU DOING UP
HERE?
ARE YOU LOST?

122
00:10:23,196 --> 00:10:26,443
>> I HEARD MY NAME.
I THOUGHT THAT WAS MY CUE.

123
00:10:26,443 --> 00:10:30,057
>> OH, NO.
YOU'RE THE MUSICAL GUEST.

124
00:10:30,057 --> 00:10:32,555
>> OKAY.

125
00:10:32,555 --> 00:10:36,215
WELL, IF YOU WANT ME TO BE IN
SKETCHES, I HAVE --

126
00:10:39,085 --> 00:10:41,771
-- I'VE HOSTED BEFORE.

127
00:10:41,771 --> 00:10:43,593
FIVE

128
00:10:44,026 --> 00:10:47,986
>> YEAH.
WELL, THAT WAS TEN YEARS AGO,
SO.

129
00:10:49,286 --> 00:10:51,274
>> WAS IT THAT LONG?

130
00:10:51,274 --> 00:10:56,622
>> WELL, I MEAN, EITHER WAY, I'M
SO HAPPY YOU CHOSE MY SHOW FOR
YOUR COMEBACK.

131
00:11:00,922 --> 00:11:04,565
>> IT'S -- HMM, COMEBACK.
IS THAT WHAT WE'RE CALLING IT?

132
00:11:04,565 --> 00:11:07,247
>> YEAH.
COMEBACK IN A GOOD WAY.

133
00:11:07,247 --> 00:11:10,285
>> OKAY.
I SEE WHAT THIS IS.
THIS IS WHERE WE MAKE A JOKE LIKE

134
00:11:10,285 --> 00:11:14,053
 FIRST HE WAS BRINGING SEXY
BACK, AND NOW HE'S BRINGING
COMING BACK.

135
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:18,605
>> I WOULDN'T PHRASE IT LIKE
THAT.

136
00:11:18,605 --> 00:11:22,452
>> WELL, YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.
NOW THAT I HEARD THAT OUTLOUD, THAT WAS --

137
00:11:22,452 --> 00:11:25,519
 SORRY.
ANYWAYS, JUST WANTED TO SAY GOOD LUCK,

138
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:27,572
>> THANK YOU.
- AND YOU'RE GOING TO CRUSH
IT.

139
00:11:27,572 --> 00:11:30,930
>> AND I'M HERE IF YOU NEED ME.
>> OKAY.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

140
00:11:30,930 --> 00:11:32,882
>> ARE WE DOING IT?

141
00:11:44,908 --> 00:11:49,320
I'M HERE TO SAY BREAK A LEG.

142
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,286
>> OKAY.
>> THESE ARE MY NORMAL CLOTHES.

143
00:11:51,286 --> 00:11:53,216
BREAK A LEG.

144
00:11:58,101 --> 00:12:01,047
>> BEFORE WE START, I JUST WANT TO SAY 

145
00:12:01,047 --> 00:12:05,380
THIS IS MY FAVORITE PLACE
TO BE, AND I'M SO GRATEFUL TO BE
HERE.

146
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:09,762
WE HAVE GOT A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU
TONIGHT.
JUSTIN TIMBERLAKE IS HERE.

147
00:12:09,762 --> 00:12:12,780
STICK AROUND
WE|LL BE BACK

148
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:31,084
IT'S LIKE A MINI MASON FAMILY

149

00:51:19,079 --> 00:51:21,981
LET'S SEE.

1333
00:51:21,981 --> 00:51:26,353
OH, DEAR.

1334
00:51:21,981 --> 00:51:26,353
OH, DEAR INDEED.

1335
00:51:21,981 --> 00:51:26,353
I'M SEEING THE NEWSMAN AGAIN.

1336
00:51:26,353 --> 00:51:32,425
THE CARDS AREN'T DONE WITH YOU.

1337
00:51:26,353 --> 00:51:32,425
AND THEN, THE RIVER OF COINS.

1338
00:51:26,353 --> 00:51:32,425
HUH.

1339
00:51:32,425 --> 00:51:40,900
SO THE NEWSMAN IS GIVING A

1340
00:51:32,425 --> 00:51:40,900
GREAT, GREAT DEAL OF MONEY.

1341
00:51:32,425 --> 00:51:40,900
BUT TO WHOM?

1342
00:51:40,900 --> 00:51:48,541
HUH.

1343
00:51:40,900 --> 00:51:48,541
ONLYFANS.

1344
00:51:40,900 --> 00:51:48,541
DOES THAT --

1345
00:51:48,541 --> 00:51:51,111
I DON'T KNOW.

1346
00:51:51,111 --> 00:51:55,115
DOES THAT MAKE SENSE TO YOU,

1347
00:51:51,111 --> 00:51:55,115
MICHAEL?

1348
00:51:51,111 --> 00:51:55,115
THE NEWSMAN FINANCIALLY

1349
00:51:55,115 --> 00:52:00,620
SUPPORTING ONLYFANS?

1350
00:51:55,115 --> 00:52:00,620
>> I MEAN, I WISH IT DIDN'T MAKE

1351
00:51:55,115 --> 00:52:00,620
SENSE.

1352
00:52:00,620 --> 00:52:08,628
>> I'M TELLING YOU THE CARDS

1353
00:52:00,620 --> 00:52:08,628
WANT TO EMPHASIZE THESE ONLYFANS

1354
00:52:00,620 --> 00:52:08,628
HAVE BANKRUPTED THE NEWSMAN.

1355
00:52:08,628 --> 00:52:11,331
>> IT'S THAT BAD?

1356
00:52:08,628 --> 00:52:11,331
COME ON.

1357
00:52:08,628 --> 00:52:11,331
>> WAIT.

1358
00:52:11,331 --> 00:52:16,369
THE CARDS ARE SPEAKING TO ME.

1359
00:52:11,331 --> 00:52:16,369
THEY'RE STILL SPEAKING TO ME.

1360
00:52:11,331 --> 00:52:16,369
ALL RIGHT.

1361
00:52:16,369 --> 00:52:21,975
THE NEWSMAN AGAIN.

1362
00:52:16,369 --> 00:52:21,975
THE BEAUTIFUL WOMAN.

1363
00:52:16,369 --> 00:52:21,975
AND NOW I'M SEEING A WEDDING

1364
00:52:21,975 --> 00:52:26,680
ALTER.

1365
00:52:21,975 --> 00:52:26,680
>> OH, OKAY.

1366
00:52:21,975 --> 00:52:26,680
THAT SOUNDS GOOD, RIGHT?

1367
00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:36,756
>> OH, I'M NOT SURE.

1368
00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:36,756
OH, THE CATFISH.

1369
00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:36,756
SO IN THE END, YOUR NEWSMAN

1370
00:52:36,756 --> 00:52:41,094
CONNECTS TO A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN

1371
00:52:36,756 --> 00:52:41,094
WHO TURNS OUT TO BE A CATFISH.

1372
00:52:36,756 --> 00:52:41,094
BUT WHO?

1373
00:52:41,094 --> 00:52:50,403
WHO IS THE CATFISH?

1374
00:52:41,094 --> 00:52:50,403
COLIN JOST.

00:52:41,094 --> 00:52:50,403
COLIN JOST.

1376
00:52:50,403 --> 00:52:57,344
>> WHAT?

00:52:50,403 --> 00:52:57,344
I'VE -- I'M SORRY, MAN.

1378
00:52:50,403 --> 00:52:57,344
I FEEL BAD, BUT I'VE BEEN HAVING

1379
00:52:57,344 --> 00:53:02,115
A BLAST.

1380
00:52:57,344 --> 00:53:02,115

COLIN JOST

1385
00:53:17,364 --> 00:53:26,573
EXCITED WHEN LILY MET RILE, BUT

1386
00:53:17,364 --> 00:53:26,573
WHEN ATLAS CAME BACK.

1387
00:53:17,364 --> 00:53:26,573
>> AM I A BAD PERSON FOR LIKING

1388
00:53:26,573 --> 00:53:31,578
ATLAS?

1389
00:53:26,573 --> 00:53:31,578
>> I STILL HAVE NO IDEA WHO OR

1390
00:53:26,573 --> 00:53:31,578
WHAT YOU GUYS ARE TALKING ABOUT.

1391
00:53:31,578 --> 00:53:36,616
>> GIRL, DIDN'T YOU READ THE

1392
00:53:31,578 --> 00:53:36,616
BOOK?

1393
00:53:31,578 --> 00:53:36,616
>> WELL, UNFORTUNATELY, NO.

1394
00:53:36,616 --> 00:53:42,589
MY MIND'S BEEN A LITTLE BIT

1395
00:53:36,616 --> 00:53:42,589
ELSEWHERE.

1396
00:53:36,616 --> 00:53:42,589
>> OKAY.

1397
00:53:42,589 --> 00:53:50,430

00:53:50,430 --> 00:53:54,401
>> I HAVE BEEN SO SWAMPED.

1401
00:53:50,430 --> 00:53:54,401
PREOCCUPIED REALLY.

1402
00:53:50,430 --> 00:53:54,401
>> REALLY, IT'S OKAY.

1403
00:53:54,401 --> 00:54:01,174
>> THINGS HAVE JUST BEEN A

1404
00:53:54,401 --> 00:54:01,174
LITTLE BIT CRAZY.

1405
00:53:54,401 --> 00:54:01,174
SINCE I GOT THE CALL.

1406
00:54:01,174 --> 00:54:14,921
>> WHAT CALL?

1407
00:54:01,174 --> 00:54:14,921

THAT SAYS I'M GOING TO BE ON

1409
00:54:14,921 --> 00:54:20,694
SHARK TANK.

WE SHOOT, THINGS ARE PROBABLY

1413
00:54:20,694 --> 00:54:25,165
GOING TO BE QUITE DIFFERENT.

1414
00:54:20,694 --> 00:54:25,165
THE POWER STRUCTURE IN THIS

1415
00:54:25,165 --> 00:54:30,437
FRIEND GROUP IS GONNA SHIFT.

1416
00:54:25,165 --> 00:54:30,437

1417
00:54:25,165 --> 00:54:30,437
AN INVENTOR.

1418
00:54:30,437 --> 00:54:38,144
>> YEAH.

1419
00:54:30,437 --> 00:54:38,144
WHAT'S THE IDEA?

1420
00:54:30,437 --> 00:54:38,144
>> WELL, IT'S JUST THIS LITTLE

1421
00:54:38,144 --> 00:54:44,351
T-SHIRT THAT SAYS -- DON'T ASK

1422
00:54:38,144 --> 00:54:44,351
IF I'M OKAY.

1423
00:54:38,144 --> 00:54:44,351
I'M OKAY.

1424
00:54:44,351 --> 00:54:50,557
BUT IF EVERYONE STARTS ASKING IF

1425
00:54:44,351 --> 00:54:50,557
I'M OKAY, I MIGHT START CRYING.

1426
00:54:44,351 --> 00:54:50,557
>> SO IS IT LIKE A SPECIAL TYPE

1427
00:54:50,557 --> 00:54:55,862
OF T-SHIRT?

1428
00:54:50,557 --> 00:54:55,862
>> HOW DO YOU MEAN?

1429
00:54:50,557 --> 00:54:55,862
>> LIKE DOES THE T-SHIRT DO

1430
00:54:55,862 --> 00:55:02,602
ANYTHING?

1431
00:54:55,862 --> 00:55:02,602
>> OR IS IT JUST A T-SHIRT THAT

1432
00:54:55,862 --> 00:55:02,602
SAYS THAT ON IT?

1433
00:55:02,602 --> 00:55:07,107
>> HUH, BINGO.

1434
00:55:02,602 --> 00:55:07,107
SHE MIGHT BE UGLY, BUT SHE'S

1435
00:55:02,602 --> 00:55:07,107
SMART.

1436
00:55:07,107 --> 00:55:13,646
>> GIRL, I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S

1437
00:55:07,107 --> 00:55:13,646
REALLY "SHARK TANK "MATERIAL.

1438
00:55:07,107 --> 00:55:13,646
>> ARE YOU JEALOUS THAT WHEN I'M

1441
00:55:13,646 --> 00:55:21,087
OF YOUR SMALL STINKY HOUSE?

1442
00:55:21,087 --> 00:55:25,525
>> MY HOUSE ISN'T STINKY.

1443
00:55:21,087 --> 00:55:25,525
>> WELL --

1444
00:55:21,087 --> 00:55:25,525
>> IT'S GROSS.

1445
00:55:25,525 --> 00:55:31,731
>> I'M JUST SAYING I THINK A

1446
00:55:25,525 --> 00:55:31,731
SHIRT THAT SAYS DON'T ASK ME HOW

1448
00:55:31,731 --> 00:55:35,602
SHARKS.

1449
00:55:31,731 --> 00:55:35,602
>> THAT'S NOT WHAT IT SAYS,

1450
00:55:31,731 --> 00:55:35,602
NUMB-NUTS.

1451
00:55:35,602 --> 00:55:41,675
I DISTILLED THE ENTIRE HUMAN

1452
00:55:35,602 --> 00:55:41,675
EXPERIENCE INTO THREE SENTENCES.

1453
00:55:35,602 --> 00:55:41,675
DON'T ASK IF I'M OKAY.

1454
00:55:41,675 --> 00:55:47,681
I'M OKAY.

1455
00:55:41,675 --> 00:55:47,681
BUT IF EVERYONE STARTS ASKING IF

1456
00:55:41,675 --> 00:55:47,681
I'M OKAY, I MIGHT START CRYING.

1457
00:55:47,681 --> 00:55:51,518
>> IF I'M BEING HONEST, I THINK

1458
00:55:47,681 --> 00:55:51,518
IT'S TOO MANY WORDS.

1459
00:55:47,681 --> 00:55:51,518

WELL, LET ME ASK YOU THIS.

1466
00:56:02,929 --> 00:56:10,603

ARE YOU OKAY?

1470
00:56:10,603 --> 00:56:16,743

1478
00:56:26,886 --> 00:56:32,359
SAYS HE'S LOOKING FOR WORK, BUT

1479
00:56:26,886 --> 00:56:32,359
I FOLLOWED HIM MONDAY, AND HE

1480
00:56:32,359 --> 00:56:40,467
SAT IN HIS CAR AND ATE TWO

1481
00:56:32,359 --> 00:56:40,467
BAGELS WITH NOTHING ON THEM AND

1482
00:56:32,359 --> 00:56:40,467
NOT CUT IN HALF.

1483
00:56:40,467 --> 00:56:42,969
>> HERE.

01:03:38,551 --> 01:03:43,790
>> POOR.

1666
01:03:38,551 --> 01:03:43,790
>> WHOA!

1667
01:03:43,790 --> 01:03:47,761
>> SORRY.

1668
01:03:43,790 --> 01:03:47,761
IT WAS AFTER YOU VENMO REQUESTED

1669
01:03:43,790 --> 01:03:47,761
ME FOR A SODA.

1670
01:03:47,761 --> 01:03:52,098
I JUST --

1671
01:03:47,761 --> 01:03:52,098
>> NOW, MRS. VANESSA.

1672
01:03:47,761 --> 01:03:52,098
YOU STILL THERE?

1673
01:03:52,098 --> 01:03:57,470
>> DUDE, THIS ISN'T A PHONE

1674
01:03:52,098 --> 01:03:57,470
CALL.

1675
01:03:52,098 --> 01:03:57,470
I HAVE NOT MOVED FROM YOUR EYE

1676
01:03:57,470 --> 01:04:01,041
LINE.

1677
01:03:57,470 --> 01:04:01,041
I'M RIGHT HERE.

1678
01:03:57,470 --> 01:04:01,041
WHAT ELSE DO I NEED TO DO?

1679
01:04:01,041 --> 01:04:06,212
IS THE DIARY ENTRY NOT ENOUGH?

1680
01:04:01,041 --> 01:04:06,212
>> THAT DOES NOT MEAN THIS IS

1681
01:04:01,041 --> 01:04:06,212
YOUR BAG.

1682
01:04:06,212 --> 01:04:12,152
THAT DIARY COULD HAVE FLOWN UP

1683
01:04:06,212 --> 01:04:12,152
OUT OF YOUR BAG, STOPPED, AND

1684
01:04:06,212 --> 01:04:12,152
THEN DOWN INTO ANOTHER.

1685
01:04:12,152 --> 01:04:17,490
>> THERE'S NO WAY THAT HAPPENED.

1686
01:04:12,152 --> 01:04:17,490
>> ALSO SEEING SOME MEDICATION.

1687
01:04:12,152 --> 01:04:17,490
CAN YOU TELL ME WHAT THE LABEL

1688
01:04:17,490 --> 01:04:19,659
SAYS?

1689
01:04:17,490 --> 01:04:19,659
>> IMODIUM.

1690
01:04:17,490 --> 01:04:19,659
>> UH-HUH.

1691
01:04:19,659 --> 01:04:28,134
CAN YOU BE MORE SPECIFICALLY?

1692
01:04:19,659 --> 01:04:28,134
>> IT'S EXTREME IMODIUM FOR

1693
01:04:19,659 --> 01:04:28,134
UNUSUAL DIARRHEA.

1694
01:04:28,134 --> 01:04:34,507
>> NOW UNUSUAL LIKE HOW?

1695
01:04:28,134 --> 01:04:34,507
BECAUSE I WOULDN'T CONSIDER ANY

1696
01:04:28,134 --> 01:04:34,507
DIARRHEA AS USUAL.

1697
01:04:34,507 --> 01:04:40,547
THIS MUST BE LIKE A SPOOKY KIND,

1698
01:04:34,507 --> 01:04:40,547
HUH?

1699
01:04:34,507 --> 01:04:40,547
>> MAYBE WE DON'T GO BACK TO

1700
01:04:40,547 --> 01:04:43,183
MINE.

1701
01:04:40,547 --> 01:04:43,183
>> NO, PLEASE.

1702
01:04:40,547 --> 01:04:43,183
THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

1703
01:04:43,183 --> 01:04:46,319
CAN I PLEASE SPEAK TO YOUR

1704
01:04:43,183 --> 01:04:46,319
SUPERVISOR?

1705
01:04:43,183 --> 01:04:46,319
>> YEAH.

1706
01:04:46,319 --> 01:04:52,258
RANGO, YOU BACK THERE?

1707
01:04:46,319 --> 01:04:52,258
>> YEAH.

1708
01:04:46,319 --> 01:04:52,258
WHAT SEEMS TO BE THE PROBLEM?

1709
01:04:52,258 --> 01:04:57,163
>> I THINK THIS BEAUTIFUL LADY

1710
01:04:52,258 --> 01:04:57,163
MAY BE DISPLEASED.

1711
01:04:52,258 --> 01:04:57,163
>> WELL, HOW CAN I BE OF

1712
01:04:57,163 --> 01:04:59,899
ASSISTANCE?

1713
01:04:57,163 --> 01:04:59,899
>> WHY DO YOU GUYS TALK THE

1714
01:04:57,163 --> 01:04:59,899
SAME?

1715
01:04:59,899 --> 01:05:06,706
>> WELL, THIS IS MY SON.

1716
01:04:59,899 --> 01:05:06,706
>> UH-HUH.

1717
01:04:59,899 --> 01:05:06,706
>> AND THIS IS MY FATHER, RANGO.

1718
01:05:06,706 --> 01:05:13,246
>> THAT'S SHORT FOR RANGORIUS.

1719
01:05:06,706 --> 01:05:13,246
HELLO TO YOU, BEAUTIFUL

1720
01:05:06,706 --> 01:05:13,246
TRAVELER.

1721
01:05:13,246 --> 01:05:19,052
>> CAN YOU PLEASE GIVE ME ME BAG

1722
01:05:13,246 --> 01:05:19,052
BACK.

1723
01:05:13,246 --> 01:05:19,052
I'VE PROVEN THAT'S MY

1724
01:05:19,052 --> 01:05:23,890
MEDICATION.

1725
01:05:19,052 --> 01:05:23,890
>> YOUR MEDICATION COULD HAVE

1726
01:05:19,052 --> 01:05:23,890
EASILY FLOWN UP OUT OF YOUR BAG,

1727
01:05:23,890 --> 01:05:28,762
STOPPED, THOUGHT ABOUT IT, AND

1728
01:05:23,890 --> 01:05:28,762
THEN LANDED INTO ANOTHER.

1729
01:05:23,890 --> 01:05:28,762
>> I'M JUST GOING TO HEAD OUT.

1730
01:05:28,762 --> 01:05:33,533
HAVEN'T SLEPT, THIS IS SUPER

1731
01:05:28,762 --> 01:05:33,533
WEIRD, AND I DON'T KNOW YOU THAT

1732
01:05:28,762 --> 01:05:33,533
WELL.

1733
01:05:33,533 --> 01:05:36,569
I DIDN'T EVEN CARE ABOUT THE

1734
01:05:33,533 --> 01:05:36,569
DIARRHEA THING, BUT ALSO LIKE I

1735
01:05:33,533 --> 01:05:36,569
DON'T LOVE IT, SO.

1736
01:05:36,569 --> 01:05:45,879
NICE TO MEET YOU.

1737
01:05:36,569 --> 01:05:45,879
>> MRS. VANESSA, I CANNOT HELP

1738
01:05:36,569 --> 01:05:45,879
BUT FEEL SOMEWHAT RESPONSIBLE

1739

1741
01:05:45,879 --> 01:05:47,681

>> THAT WAS A VERY NICE LADY.

1745
01:05:55,722 --> 01:05:58,391
VERY NICE LADY.
