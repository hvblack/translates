1
00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:07,839
>>> HAPPY BIRTHDAY.

2
00:00:11,143 --> 00:00:14,307
HAPPY 30th BIRTHDAY, MATTHEW,
MAKE A WISH.

3
00:00:14,307 --> 00:00:15,831
>> OKAY.

4
00:00:16,019 --> 00:00:19,387
GOSH, THANKS SO MUCH, KELSEY,
THIS MEANS SO MUCH TO ME,

5
00:00:19,387 --> 00:00:21,789
ESPECIALLY WITH EVERYTHING GOING
ON IN THE WORLD,

6
00:00:21,789 --> 00:00:25,350
GOVERNMENT
SHUTDOWN, AI, JUST SO MUCH
UNCERTAINTY.

7
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:29,049
BUT THE FACT MY BEAUTIFUL WIFE

8
00:00:29,049 --> 00:00:30,936
MEANS A LOT.

9
00:00:31,705 --> 00:00:33,416
>> WELL, OF COURSE.

10
00:00:33,416 --> 00:00:37,139
HEY, MATT, LOOKS LIKE SOME
SPECIAL GUESTS JUST ARRIVED.

11
00:00:37,139 --> 00:00:40,045
>> OH, MY GOD, KELSEY, DID YOU
FLY OUT MY BEST FRIENDS?

12
00:00:40,045 --> 00:00:43,623

14
00:00:48,671 --> 00:00:52,935
FOR THOSE OF YOU HAVE HAVEN'T

15
00:00:52,935 --> 00:00:55,040
WE WENT TO NURSING SCHOOL TOGETHER

16
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:57,192
BUT I DIDN'T GRADUATE.

17
00:00:57,192 --> 00:01:00,431
HELP

00:01:00,432 --> 00:01:03,622

DIDN'T
I GOT MY BFF DEGREE

00:01:08,812 --> 00:01:12,354
BECAUSE I MET KELSEY'S BESTIES, AKA THE
KELSQUAD.

22
00:01:12,354 --> 00:01:14,759
HEY

23
00:01:14,759 --> 00:01:18,867
>> OH, IT'S MY BIRTHDAY BUT YOUR
FRIENDS ARE GIVING A SPEECH.

24
00:01:18,867 --> 00:01:20,468
SO GOOD.

25
00:01:20,468 --> 00:01:24,120
>> LAST MONTH, KELSEY ASKED YOU
TO GO ON A TRIP WITH HER

26
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:27,940
TO FIND
THE MOST MAGICAL BIRTHDAY
PRESENT FOR MATTHEW.

27
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:31,908
>> THEY SAY DISNEY'S THE MOST
MAGICAL PLACE ON EARTH.

28
00:01:31,908 --> 00:01:36,515
>> BUT WE'RE BANNED FROM THERE,
SO WE WENT TO NASHVILLE.

29
00:01:39,298 --> 00:01:43,536
¶ OUR KELSEY CALLED US BECAUSE
SHE WANTED TO ¶

30
00:01:43,536 --> 00:01:47,961
¶ FIND A REALLY GOOD GIFT FOR
MATTHEW ¶

31
00:01:48,841 --> 00:01:53,157
¶ WE WERE AVAILABLE BECAUSE WE
LOVE HER ¶

32
00:01:53,157 --> 00:01:57,934
¶ AND BECAUSE WE WANTED THE
DELTA POINTS ¶

33
00:01:57,934 --> 00:02:00,236
>> WOW, YOU LADIES SURE LOVE
TRAVELING TOGETHER.

34
00:02:00,236 --> 00:02:02,342
WHY ARE YOUR SCHEDULES SO OPEN?

35
00:02:02,342 --> 00:02:06,553
¶ AND KELSEY SET ONE BOUNDARY

36
00:02:06,553 --> 00:02:10,479
SHE SAID THIS TRIP ¶
¶ WAS MEANT TO BE

37
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:12,987
JUST ABOUT A
GIFT FOR MATT ¶

38
00:02:12,987 --> 00:02:15,102
AND NOT NOT ABOUT ABOUT

39
00:02:15,102 --> 00:02:20,713
SEEING THE ONE ¶
¶ GUY SHE WAS THINKING OF ¶

40
00:02:20,713 --> 00:02:23,595
>> WHO WERE YOU THINKING OF?
>> YOU, DUMMY.

41
00:02:23,595 --> 00:02:26,619
BUT I NEEDED TO FOCUS ON GETTING
YOU AN AWESOME GIFT.

42
00:02:26,619 --> 00:02:31,550
>> BUT I OPENED MY GIFT ALREADY.
YOU GOT ME A HOODIE FROM HUDSON
NEWS.

43
00:02:32,034 --> 00:02:33,936
¶ WHILE WE WENT OUT

44
00:02:33,936 --> 00:02:35,872
KELS SAT ALONE IN THE HOTEL ¶

45
00:02:35,872 --> 00:02:37,822
¶ AND SAID I DON'T REALLY FEEL
WELL ¶

46
00:02:37,822 --> 00:02:41,549
¶ I NEED TO BE ALONE

47
00:02:41,549 --> 00:02:43,570
WHEN WE GOT HOME ¶

48
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:45,630
¶ WE PULLED BACK ALL OF THE
COVERS ¶

49
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:47,479
¶ AND WE SAW THAT THERE WAS JUST

50
00:02:47,479 --> 00:02:51,077
A PUNCH OF PILLOWS ¶

51
00:02:51,077 --> 00:02:55,588
¶ WE CHECKED IN WITH THE FRONT
DESK THEY SAID SHE LEFT ¶

52
00:02:55,671 --> 00:02:59,177
¶ IN A BIKINI ABOUT FOUR HOURS
AGO ¶

53
00:02:59,177 --> 00:03:02,155
¶ SHE WAS HOLDING TWO GRAND IN CASH

54
00:03:02,155 --> 00:03:07,689
AND SHE ¶
¶ ONLY CHOSE TO BRING HER BURNER
PHONE ¶

55
00:03:07,689 --> 00:03:12,326
¶ ONE NIGHT WITH DOMINGO ¶

56
00:03:14,006 --> 00:03:17,702
>> OKAY, SO DOMINGO WAS IN
NASHVILLE?

57
00:03:17,702 --> 00:03:19,867
>> YOU COULD HAVE COME ON THE
TRIP, BABE.

58
00:03:19,867 --> 00:03:24,035
>> NO I COULDN'T, I WAS IN
ALBANY ATTENDING A SELF-WORTH
SEMINAR.

59
00:03:24,035 --> 00:03:26,357
>> OUR NASHVILLE TRIP WAS MAGIC.

60
00:03:26,357 --> 00:03:29,048
LIKE DID SOMEONE SAY
ABRACADABRA?

61
00:03:29,048 --> 00:03:31,195
>> NO, NO ONE DID.

62
00:03:31,195 --> 00:03:35,820
>> BABE, I PROMISE, THIS NEXT
SONG WILL NOT BE ABOUT DOMINGO.

63
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:43,538
¶ D-O-M-I-N-G-O DOMINGO ¶
¶ D-O-M-I-N-G-O DOMINGO ¶

KELSEY TELLS HIM I

00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:29,370
BUT BABE, I PROMISE, DOMINGO IS
IN THE PAST.

76
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:31,625

NO, JUST KIDDING, I LIVE VERY
CLOSE BY.

80
00:04:42,281 --> 00:04:46,182
KELSEY, THE NIGHT WE SPENT
TOGETHER IN NASHVILLE

81
00:04:46,182 --> 00:04:49,969
WAS
ANYTHING BUT ORDINARY.

82
00:04:50,556 --> 00:04:52,996
¶ I KNOW THAT YOU TOOK A VOW

ANY OF YOUR
VOCAL RANGES.

89
00:05:11,597 --> 00:05:14,886
ALSO WHATEVER HAPPENED TO THE

98
00:05:39,203 --> 00:05:42,530

AGAIN.

100
00:05:45,524 --> 00:05:50,327
LIVE FROM NEW YORK, IT'S
SATURDAY NIGHT!

101
00:07:53,962 --> 00:07:59,479
HOST

LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, SABRINA
CARPENTER!

103
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:27,804
THANK

104
00:08:27,804 --> 00:08:31,006
I'M SO EXCITED TO BE HERE
HOSTING "SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE."

105
00:08:31,006 --> 00:08:33,185
LAST TIME I WAS HERE FOR THE 50th ANNIVERSARY

106
00:08:33,185 --> 00:08:35,183
WHERE I GOT TO
SING WITH PAUL SIMON.

107
00:08:35,183 --> 00:08:38,222
SINCE THEN, MY NEW ALBUM "MAN'S
BEST FRIEND" CAME OUT,

108
00:08:38,222 --> 00:08:39,736
WHICH I'M
EXCITED ABOUT.

109
00:08:39,736 --> 00:08:42,695
BUT SOME
PEOPLE GOT A LITTLE FREAKED OUT
BY THE COVER.

110
00:08:42,695 --> 00:08:45,257
NOT SURE WHY, IT WAS JUST THIS.

111
00:08:45,257 --> 00:08:48,656
ME ON ALL FOURS WITH AN UNSEEN
FIGURE
PULLING MY HAIR.

112
00:08:48,656 --> 00:08:51,820
BUT WHAT PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE IS
THAT'S JUST HOW THEY CROPPED IT.

113
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:55,540
IF YOU ZOOM OUT, IT'S CLEARLY A
PICTURE FROM THE 50th
ANNIVERSARY SPECIAL

114
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:58,740
OF BOWEN
HELPING ME UP BY THE HAIR.

115
00:09:02,845 --> 00:09:07,203
AFTER MARTIN SHORT SHOVED ME OUT
OF THE BUFFET LINE.

116
00:09:07,203 --> 00:09:11,614
SAYING SOMETHING LIKE
DADDY NEED HIS MINI QUICHE.

117
00:09:11,614 --> 00:09:16,260
NOW SINCE I'M HERE, I WANT TO
CLEAR UP SOME MISCONCEPTIONS
PEOPLE HAVE ABOUT ME.

118
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:19,346
EVERYONE THINKS OF ME AS THIS
HORN-DOG POP STAR.

119
00:09:19,346 --> 00:09:21,060
BUT THERE'S SO MUCH MORE TO ME.

120
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:24,745
I'M NOT JUST HORNY, I'M ALSO
TURNED ON.

121
00:09:24,745 --> 00:09:27,518
I'M SEXUALLY CHARGED.

122
00:09:27,518 --> 00:09:29,980
AND I LOVE TO READ.

123
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:32,773
MY FAVORITE BOOK IS THE
ENCYCLOPEDIA.

124
00:09:32,773 --> 00:09:36,139
IT'S SO BIG AND IT'S HARD --

125
00:09:36,139 --> 00:09:37,719
WAIT, SERIOUSLY. SORRY,

126
00:09:37,719 --> 00:09:41,983
THERE IS A REAL PERSON
UNDER ALL
THE SPARKLES, CORSETS AND WIGS,

127
00:09:41,983 --> 00:09:43,703
ANOTHER THING YOU MIGHT NOT KNOW
ABOUT ME

128
00:09:43,703 --> 00:09:46,668
IS I LOVE TO INTERACT
WITH THE AUDIENCE DURING MY
SHOWS.

129
00:09:46,668 --> 00:09:49,159
I'D LIKE TO DO THAT NOW.

130
00:09:49,159 --> 00:09:52,061
HI, SIR, WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

131
00:09:52,061 --> 00:09:53,649
>> MY NAME IS WILL.

132
00:09:53,649 --> 00:09:57,618
>> WILL, WHAT A SEXY, UNUSUAL
NAME, WILL.

133
00:09:57,618 --> 00:10:00,618
WHERE ARE YOU FROM?
>> MARYLAND.

134
00:10:00,618 --> 00:10:04,783
>> MARYLAND, OH, WHAT A SEXY,
UNUSUAL PLACE.

135
00:10:04,783 --> 00:10:07,391
SEE, I LOVE TALKING TO NORMAL
PEOPLE.

136
00:10:07,391 --> 00:10:09,271
THEY'RE SO FASCINATING WHEN
THEIR REAL.

137
00:10:09,271 --> 00:10:12,057
LIKE YOU SIR, HI, WHAT DO YOU DO
FOR WORK.

138
00:10:12,057 --> 00:10:15,427
>> VENTURE CAPITAL.
>> AWESOME.

139
00:10:17,814 --> 00:10:20,943
BUT HONESTLY, I CAN HAVE
CHEMISTRY WITH LITERALLY
ANYTHING.

140
00:10:20,943 --> 00:10:22,637
LIKE THIS GUY.

141
00:10:23,509 --> 00:10:27,260
I CAN'T WITH YOU, YOU LOOK LIKE
MY BROTHER.

142
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:31,482
I'M GOING BACK UP HERE.

143
00:10:31,951 --> 00:10:34,529
SO ANOTHER FUN THING I LIKE TO
DO AT MY CONCERTS

144
00:10:34,529 --> 00:10:38,073
IS ARREST
SOMEONE FOR BEING HOT.
WHO CAN I ARREST TONIGHT.

145
00:10:38,073 --> 00:10:40,738
>> NOT SO FAST, SABRINA CARPENTER,

146
00:10:40,738 --> 00:10:44,248
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST.
>> FOR BEING HOT?

147
00:10:44,248 --> 00:10:49,780
NO. MORE FOR FALSELY
IMPERSONATING AN OFFICER AT CONCERTS

148
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:52,965
AND ARRESTING HOT
PEOPLE.

149
00:10:52,965 --> 00:10:57,319
>> KENAN, YOU'RE NOT A COP.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HER

150
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,012
FINE

151
00:10:59,012 --> 00:11:01,829
>> I'M HERE FOR A CAMEO FOR MY
NIECE.

152

OR NOT
ON OTHER PEOPLE'S EXPECTATIONS OF ME

 WHAT EVERYONE
HAS BEEN ASKING HIM TO RELEASE -- 

685
00:38:50,362 --> 00:38:52,986
GEORGE SANTOS,

686
00:38:52,986 --> 00:38:55,345
 THE FORMER REPUBLICAN CONGRESSMAN

687
00:38:55,345 --> 00:38:57,474
WHO HAD PLED GUILTY TO FRAUD

688
00:38:57,474 --> 00:39:00,789
 AND SOMETHING CALLED
AGGRAVATED IDENTITY THEFT.

689
00:39:00,789 --> 00:39:04,722
WHICH I THINK IS WHEN YOU PUSH
SOMEONE IN A CLOSET AND CHANGE
CLOTHES WITH THEM.

690
00:39:04,722 --> 00:39:08,553
IS NOW
FREE AND WILL FACE ZERO
CONSEQUENCES.

691
00:39:08,553 --> 00:39:11,217
HE'S SAID HE'S A CHANGED MAN

692
00:39:11,217 --> 00:39:15,306
 AND ALSO RELEASED A PHOTO OF
HIS NEW PRISON BODY.

693
00:39:16,893 --> 00:39:22,105
>> VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY HAS SAID
IF PRESIDENT TRUMP SUPPLIES
UKRAINE WITH TOMAHAWK MISSILES,

694
00:39:22,105 --> 00:39:24,919
HE WILL NOMINATE TRUMP FOR THE
NOBEL PEACE PRIZE.

695
00:39:24,919 --> 00:39:28,602
YOU KNOW, THE PRIZE THEY GIVE
YOU FOR SELLING MISSILES.

696
00:39:28,602 --> 00:39:33,525
THERE WAS OUTRAGE THIS WEEK
OVER A LEAKED GROUP CHAT BETWEEN
REPUBLICAN LEADERS 

697
00:39:33,525 --> 00:39:38,075
WHICH PRAISED
HITLER AND REFERRED TO BLACK
AMERICANS AS WATERMELON PEOPLE.

698
00:39:38,075 --> 00:39:41,133
THE CHAT WAS NAMED JOST FAMILY.

699
00:39:46,071 --> 00:39:48,428
>> WHAT DID I DO TO YOU?

700
00:39:48,428 --> 00:39:52,548
>> WHILE TRAVELING ON AIR FORCE
ONE TO THE MIDDLE EAST TO
CELEBRATE THE CEASEFIRE,

701
00:39:52,548 --> 00:39:57,691
PRESIDENT TRUMP TOLD REPORTERS,
I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANYTHING
THAT'S GOING TO GET ME INTO
HEAVEN.

702
00:39:57,691 --> 00:40:00,534
THEN HE PAUSED FOR TEN FULL MINUTES

703
00:40:00,534 --> 00:40:03,979
 WAITING FOR SOMEONE TO
SAY THAT'S NOT TRUE.

704
00:40:03,979 --> 00:40:06,374
BECAUSE TRUMP CAN'T GO TO HEAVEN, 

705
00:40:06,374 --> 00:40:10,584
HE'S FAR TOO BUSY DOWN
HERE, RUNNING HELL.

706
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:15,914
>> PRESIDENT TRUMP ANNOUNCED
THAT ANOTHER ALLEGED DRUG
SMUGGLING BOAT FROM VENEZUELA

707
00:40:15,914 --> 00:40:18,431
HAS BEEN BLOWN OUT OF THE WATER
WITHOUT WARNING.

708
00:40:18,431 --> 00:40:21,208
YOU MAY NOT THINK THAT'S A BIG
DEAL RIGHT NOW, 

709
00:40:21,208 --> 00:40:24,915
BUT ONE DAY SOON
YOU'LL LOOK AT YOURSELF IN THE
MIRROR AND REALIZE -- 

710
00:40:24,915 --> 00:40:27,353
YOU'RE OUT
OF COCAINE.

711
00:40:30,457 --> 00:40:43,756
PRESIDENT TRUMP CRITICIZED

712
00:40:43,758 --> 00:40:44,491
TIME MAGAZINE FOR USING A BAD

713
00:40:44,493 --> 00:40:45,291
PICTURE OF HIM ON THE COVER,

714
00:40:45,293 --> 00:40:46,025
SAYING QUOTE, THEY DISAPPEARED

715
00:40:46,027 --> 00:40:48,094
MY HAIR.

716
00:40:48,096 --> 00:40:51,331
AND I GOT TO AGREE.

717
00:40:51,333 --> 00:41:01,608
THAT THING DO LOOK WAXED.

718
00:41:01,610 --> 00:41:03,142
>> JOHN BOLTON, WHO WANTS PEOPLE

719
00:41:03,144 --> 00:41:04,110
STOP COMING UP TO HIM TO ORDER

720

ACTUAL LIST OF YOUR ENEMIES.

726
00:41:15,257 --> 00:41:15,855
AT LEAST THAT'S WHAT MY

727
00:41:15,857 --> 00:41:18,391
THERAPIST TOLD ME.

728
00:41:18,393 --> 00:41:25,565
SO NOW SHE'S ON THE LIST, TOO.

729
00:41:25,567 --> 00:41:26,633
HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE IN PORTLAND

730
00:41:26,635 --> 00:41:27,734
SENT A MESSAGE TO I.C.E. TO

731
00:41:27,736 --> 00:41:28,468
LEAVE THEIR CITY BY RIDING THEIR

732

BIKES NAKED THROUGH THE RAIN.

733

AND YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BELIEVE

734
00:41:30,438 --> 00:41:34,774
IT, IT DIDN'T WORK.

735
00:41:34,776 --> 00:41:36,409
>> A NEW REPORT SHOWS THAT OF

TWO BLACK PEOPLE OUT OF 100.

I'M FROM LIKE A BIG

947
00:48:56,617 --> 00:48:57,350
MINNESOTAN FAMILY, ONE OF EIGHT

948
00:48:57,352 --> 00:48:59,952
KIDS.

949
00:48:59,954 --> 00:49:02,388
>> EIGHT KIDS, WOW, YOU DO NOT

950
00:49:02,390 --> 00:49:02,855
SEE THAT A LOT.

951
00:49:02,857 --> 00:49:03,556
>> PROBABLY BECAUSE IT'S THE

952
00:49:03,558 --> 00:49:05,658
WRONG CHOICE.

953
00:49:05,660 --> 00:49:07,293
EIGHT IS TOO MANY KIDS.

954
00:49:07,295 --> 00:49:11,063
YOU KNOW HOW I KNOW THAT?

955
00:49:11,065 --> 00:49:14,533
WE HAD A CAFETERIA STYLE MILK

956
00:49:14,535 --> 00:49:16,202
MACHINE AT HOME.

957
00:49:16,204 --> 00:49:16,702
WE HAD A MILK MAN.

958
00:49:16,704 --> 00:49:17,737
TIM THE MILK MAN WAS A BIG PART

959
00:49:17,739 --> 00:49:21,073
OF MY LIFE.

960
00:49:21,075 --> 00:49:21,507
HE'D SHOW UP,

961
00:49:21,509 --> 00:49:22,208
REPLACE THE MILK, PLAY CATCH,

962
00:49:22,210 --> 00:49:23,275
CALL ME SON.

963
00:49:23,277 --> 00:49:25,911
I'D BE LIKE WHY DO I LOOK SO

964
00:49:25,913 --> 00:49:26,345
MUCH LIKE YOU?

965
00:49:26,347 --> 00:49:27,046
>> SOUNDS LIKE YOU GREW UP IN

966
00:49:27,048 --> 00:49:28,047
THE 1930s.

967
00:49:28,049 --> 00:49:29,148
>> WELL, I DIDN'T, BUT I LOOK

968
00:49:29,150 --> 00:49:33,085
LIKE I DID.

969
00:49:33,087 --> 00:49:36,389
I LOOK LIKE A LOCKET PHOTO

970
00:49:36,391 --> 00:49:37,089
DURING WORLD WAR I.

971
00:49:37,091 --> 00:49:39,825
I LOOK LIKE A GUY WHO WAS REALLY

972
00:49:39,827 --> 00:49:46,098
GOOD AT FOOTBALL PREINTEGRATION.

973
00:49:46,100 --> 00:49:48,567
I WILL SAY I THINK THE WAY I

974
00:49:48,569 --> 00:49:49,268
GREW UP HAS REALLY HELPED ME

975
00:49:49,270 --> 00:49:50,136
ADJUST TO NEW YORK.

976
00:49:50,138 --> 00:49:51,237
EVERYONE SAYS PUBLIC TRANSIT IS

977
00:49:51,239 --> 00:49:53,973
WILD.

978
00:49:53,975 --> 00:49:55,007
FOR MY ENTIRE CHILDHOOD THE TEN

979
00:49:55,009 --> 00:50:00,980
OF US RODE IN A SEVEN-SEATER

980
00:50:00,982 --> 00:50:05,217
CHEVY ASTRO VAN.

981
00:50:05,219 --> 00:50:05,951
SO ANYWHERE WE DROVE IT LOOKED

982
00:50:05,953 --> 00:50:09,989
LIKE WE WERE BEING TRAFFICKED.

983
00:50:09,991 --> 00:50:10,556
I CAN HANG.

984
00:50:10,558 --> 00:50:11,657
WATCHING PEOPLE JUMP OVER THE

985
00:50:11,659 --> 00:50:12,391
TURNSTILES, AND TODAY I WORKED

986
00:50:12,393 --> 00:50:13,259
UP THE COURAGE AND JUMPED OVER

987
00:50:13,261 --> 00:50:17,096
MY FIRST ONE.

988
00:50:17,098 --> 00:50:17,963
>> CONGRATS,

989
00:50:17,965 --> 00:50:18,597
BUDDY, JUMPED YOUR FIRST

990
00:50:18,599 --> 00:50:20,399
TURNSTILE.

991
00:50:20,401 --> 00:50:21,634
>> IT WAS COOL, IT WAS

992
00:50:21,636 --> 00:50:23,169
EXHILARATING AND THRILLING.

993
00:50:23,171 --> 00:50:27,473
IT WAS ON THE WAY OUT BUT I

994
00:50:27,475 --> 00:50:29,008
-- IT FELT GOOD, IT COUNTS.

995
00:50:29,010 --> 00:50:29,942
>> IT STILL COUNTS.

996
00:50:29,944 --> 00:50:33,512
YOU'RE A GOOD BOY.

997
00:50:33,514 --> 00:50:35,648
>> SURE.

998
00:50:35,650 --> 00:50:36,082
YEAH.

999
00:50:36,084 --> 00:50:39,985
I'M A GOOD BOY.

1000
00:50:39,987 --> 00:50:43,355
I'M JUST REALLY SCARED OF BEING

1001
00:50:43,357 --> 00:50:45,591
IN TROUBLE ALL THE TIME BECAUSE

1002
00:50:45,593 --> 00:50:47,726
I GREW UP CATHOLIC.

1003
00:50:47,728 --> 00:50:50,262
I GREW UP FEELING GUILTY BUT

1004
00:50:50,264 --> 00:50:53,732
NEVER KNEW WHAT FOR.

1005
00:50:53,734 --> 00:50:56,402
IF YOU GREW UP CATHOLIC, ONLY

1006
00:50:56,404 --> 00:50:59,205
SINS YOU KNOW ARE LIKE BREAKING

1007
00:50:59,207 --> 00:50:59,538
THE TEN

1008
00:50:59,540 --> 00:51:00,239
COMMANDMENTS -- DON'T STEAL,

1009
00:51:00,241 --> 00:51:00,973
DON'T KILL, RIGHT TO BEAR ARMS

1010
00:51:00,975 --> 00:51:01,373
OR WHATEVER.

1011
00:51:01,375 --> 00:51:02,408
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY IN

1012
00:51:02,410 --> 00:51:05,845
CONFESSION.

1013
00:51:05,847 --> 00:51:07,947
COULDN'T CONFESS TO THE ONE SIN

1014
00:51:07,949 --> 00:51:10,316

CRYING IN BED

1282
01:01:39,997 --> 01:01:41,630
WHAT A FAMILIAR FEELING ¶

1283

SO FINE AND SO DECEIVING ¶

1290

01:02:17,534 --> 01:02:20,235
JUST THOUGHT THAT

1296
01:02:20,237 --> 01:02:22,938
HE EVENTUALLY

1297
01:02:22,940 --> 01:02:26,741
WOULD CAVE IN, REACH OUT ¶

1298
01:02:26,743 --> 01:02:28,877
¶ BUT NO SIREE

1299

1300
01:02:32,683 --> 01:02:35,951
HE DISCOVERED IT THIS WEEK

1301
01:02:35,953 --> 01:02:36,518
THIS WEEK, OH AH ¶

WHAT A FAMILIAR FEELING ¶

1330
01:03:40,651 --> 01:03:42,250
¶ ALL MY FRIENDS IN LOVE

1331
01:03:42,252 --> 01:03:48,256
AND I'M THE ONE THEY CALL

1332

TO BELIEVE IN ¶

1339
01:04:25,294 --> 01:04:28,229
BUT GROWING UP I WAS ALWAYS TOLD

1340
01:04:28,231 --> 01:04:29,864
TO NEVER JUDGE A BOOK BY ITS

1341
01:04:29,866 --> 01:04:32,033
COVER.

1342
01:04:32,035 --> 01:04:33,134
BUT WHEN I WATCHED THE NEWS, I

1343
01:04:33,136 --> 01:04:34,235
FEEL LIKE NOBODY ELSE REMEMBERS

1344
01:04:34,237 --> 01:04:42,143
THAT LESSON.

1345
01:04:42,145 --> 01:04:44,746
>> LABUBU?

1346
01:04:44,748 --> 01:04:45,180
>> NO TEETH.

1347
01:04:45,182 --> 01:04:47,649
>> YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT TEETH.

1348
01:04:47,651 --> 01:04:50,585
>> SO I WANTED TO PUT THAT TO

1349
01:04:50,587 --> 01:04:51,519
THE TEST TONIGHT WITH A LITTLE

1350
01:04:51,521 --> 01:04:52,487
SOCIAL EXPERIMENT.

1351
01:04:52,489 --> 01:04:53,088
I FILLED A THEATER WITH

1352
01:04:53,090 --> 01:04:54,089
PROFESSIONAL ACTORS DRESSED TO

1353
01:04:54,091 --> 01:04:54,823
LOOK STEREOTYPICALLY DANGEROUS

1354
01:04:54,825 --> 01:04:55,724
OR SCARY.

1355
01:04:55,726 --> 01:04:56,791
NOT THE TYPE ONE MIGHT EXPECT TO

1356
01:04:56,793 --> 01:04:58,460
ENCOUNTER IN AN UPSCALE

1357
01:04:58,462 --> 01:04:59,527
NEIGHBORHOOD.

1358
01:04:59,529 --> 01:05:00,261
I WANTED TO SEE IF PEOPLE WOULD

1359
01:05:00,263 --> 01:05:02,197
JUDGE THEM BASED ON THEIR

1360
01:05:02,199 --> 01:05:03,298
APPEARANCE.

1361
01:05:03,300 --> 01:05:03,932
AND WHAT I FOUND FRANKLY

1362
01:05:03,934 --> 01:05:04,966
DISAPPOINTED ME.

1363
01:05:04,968 --> 01:05:06,034
OKAY.

1364
01:05:06,036 --> 01:05:07,669
FIRST GUY IS GOING IN.

1365
01:05:07,671 --> 01:05:23,852
¶¶

1366
01:05:27,323 --> 01:05:35,363
THEIR APPEARANCES.

1367
01:05:35,365 --> 01:05:36,398
EVEN THIS LADY, WHO I THOUGHT

1368
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:38,099
WOULD BE WOKE BECAUSE OF THE

1369
01:05:38,101 --> 01:05:40,769
HAIRCUT.

1370
01:05:40,771 --> 01:05:41,870
MISS, MISS, WHY DID YOU LEAVE

1371
01:05:41,872 --> 01:05:43,471
THAT MOVIE THEATER?

1372
01:05:43,473 --> 01:05:44,572
>> BECAUSE EVERYONE WAS DRESSED

1373
01:05:44,574 --> 01:05:46,207
AS FRANKENSTEIN, AND THE MOVIE I

1374
01:05:46,209 --> 01:05:47,275
WANTED TO SEE DOES NOT HAVE

1375
01:05:47,277 --> 01:05:50,779
FRANKENSTEIN IN IT.

1376
01:05:50,781 --> 01:05:52,580
>> WOW, SO YOU ASSUMED THEY WERE

1377
01:05:52,582 --> 01:05:53,815
THERE TO SEE A MOVIE ABOUT

1378
01:05:53,817 --> 01:05:54,849
FRANKENSTEIN JUST BECAUSE OF THE

1379
01:05:54,851 --> 01:05:55,884
COLOR OF THEIR SKIN?

1380
01:05:55,886 --> 01:05:56,618
>> THE COLOR OF THEIR SKIN WAS

1381
01:05:56,620 --> 01:05:59,721
GREEN.

1382
01:05:59,723 --> 01:06:01,956
>> SHE JUST SAID THE QUIET PART

1383
01:06:01,958 --> 01:06:03,758
OUT LOUD.

1384
01:06:03,760 --> 01:06:05,393
IF YOU WALKED INTO THE THEATER

1385
01:06:05,395 --> 01:06:08,363
TO SEE THE FANTASTIC 4 AND THE

1386
01:06:08,365 --> 01:06:10,999
WHOLE AUDIENCE WAS ASIAN, WHAT

1387
01:06:11,001 --> 01:06:11,566
WOULD YOU ASSUME THEN?

1388
01:06:11,568 --> 01:06:12,200
>> WHAT WOULD YOU ASSUME?

1389
01:06:12,202 --> 01:06:14,836
>> UM.

1390
01:06:14,838 --> 01:06:15,904
>> SLIGHTLY PROBLEMATIC.

1391
01:06:15,906 --> 01:06:17,005
>> EVERYONE WAS FAILING MY TEST

1392
01:06:17,007 --> 01:06:18,640
AND BEFORE LONG MY FRANKENSTEINS

1393
01:06:18,642 --> 01:06:19,707
WERE STARTING TO LOSE FAITH.

1394
01:06:19,709 --> 01:06:20,775
EVEN MY OWN GIRLFRIEND FAILED

1395
01:06:20,777 --> 01:06:21,876
WHEN I PERFORMED THE SAME

1396
01:06:21,878 --> 01:06:25,146
EXPERIMENT IN HER APARTMENT.

1397
01:06:25,148 --> 01:06:29,517
>> WE BROKE UP THREE MONTHS AGO.

1398
01:06:29,519 --> 01:06:30,618
>> AND AS MY EXPERIMENT EVOLVED,

1399
01:06:30,620 --> 01:06:31,653
I FOUND THAT PEOPLE JUDGED

1400
01:06:31,655 --> 01:06:33,321
ANYONE WHO LOOKED DIFFERENTLY.

1401
01:06:33,323 --> 01:06:37,625
EVEN A FRIENDLY FACE.

1402
01:06:37,627 --> 01:06:39,828
I HAD REACHED A LOW POINT.

1403
01:06:39,830 --> 01:06:41,429
ALSO THAT FRANKENSTEIN I THOUGHT

1404
01:06:41,431 --> 01:06:45,967
FELL ASLEEP ACTUALLY HAD DIED.

1405
01:06:45,969 --> 01:06:47,435
BUT THEN, FINALLY, ONE MAN

1406
01:06:47,437 --> 01:06:47,836
WALKED INTO

1407
01:06:47,838 --> 01:06:49,571
THAT THEATER WITHOUT JUDGMENT.

1408
01:06:49,573 --> 01:06:53,374
>> HEY, WHAT'S UP.

1409
01:06:53,376 --> 01:06:55,009
HUNGRY?

1410
01:06:55,011 --> 01:06:56,611
>> THIS MAN HAD NO REACTION AT

1411
01:06:56,613 --> 01:06:58,213
ALL TO BEING IN A THEATER FULL

1412
01:06:58,215 --> 01:06:59,881
OF FRANKENSTEINS, NOT BEFORE,

1413
01:06:59,883 --> 01:07:02,684
DURING OR AFTER THE MOVIE.

1414
01:07:02,686 --> 01:07:03,685
>> REALLY?

1415
01:07:03,687 --> 01:07:05,353
>> I HAD TO TALK TO HIM.

1416
01:07:05,355 --> 01:07:08,490
EXCUSE ME, WHY DIDN'T YOU JUDGE

1417
01:07:08,492 --> 01:07:10,525
THE FRANKENSTEINS.

1418
01:07:10,527 --> 01:07:11,659
>> WHO IS FRANKENSTEIN?

1419
01:07:11,661 --> 01:07:12,293
>> YOU'VE NEVER HEARD OF

1420
01:07:12,295 --> 01:07:13,128
FRANKENSTEIN?

1421
01:07:13,130 --> 01:07:16,731
>> I KNOW A TOM FRANKENBURG.

1422
01:07:16,733 --> 01:07:21,102
>> MARY SHELLEY'S FRANKENSTEIN?

1423
01:07:21,104 --> 01:07:22,103
>> I LOVE MARY SHELLEY.

1424
01:07:22,105 --> 01:07:24,973
>> I TOOK GOTHIC LITERATURE.

1425
01:07:24,975 --> 01:07:26,207
>> AND YOU HAVEN'T HEARD OF

1426
01:07:26,209 --> 01:07:26,641
FRANKENSTEIN?

1427
01:07:26,643 --> 01:07:27,809
>> DOESN'T RING A BELL.

1428
01:07:27,811 --> 01:07:28,376
>> EVERYONE WAS GREEN.

1429
01:07:28,378 --> 01:07:31,112
>> LIKE SHREK.

1430
01:07:31,114 --> 01:07:36,151
>> FRANKENSTEIN.

1431
01:07:36,153 --> 01:07:36,618
TOM FRANKENBURG.

1432
01:07:36,620 --> 01:07:37,352
>> YOU ALREADY TOLD ME ABOUT TOM

1433
01:07:37,354 --> 01:07:39,287
FRANKENBURG.

1434
01:07:39,289 --> 01:07:42,223
I HAD NEVER BEEN SO CONFUSED BUT

1435
01:07:42,225 --> 01:07:43,958
LATER REFLECTING ON THE MEANING

1436
01:07:43,960 --> 01:07:44,292
OF LIFE,

1437
01:07:44,294 --> 01:07:45,026
I REALIZED THE ONLY WAY TO TRULY

1438
01:07:45,028 --> 01:07:45,727
RID THE WORLD OF JUDGMENT WAS

1439
01:07:45,729 --> 01:07:47,695
THROUGH THE POWER OF SONG.

1440
01:07:47,697 --> 01:07:50,431
¶ WE ARE FRANKENSTEINS NO NEED

1441
01:07:50,433 --> 01:07:54,135
TO JUDGE US ¶

1442
01:07:54,137 --> 01:07:55,803
¶ WE ARE THE ONES MADE OUT OF

1443
01:07:55,805 --> 01:07:56,838
DEAD PEOPLE AND ¶

1444
01:07:56,840 --> 01:08:01,776
¶ CAME TO LIFE ¶

1445
01:08:16,025 --> 01:08:21,696
MUCH TO LORNE, TO THE AMAZING

1446
01:08:21,698 --> 01:08:23,631
