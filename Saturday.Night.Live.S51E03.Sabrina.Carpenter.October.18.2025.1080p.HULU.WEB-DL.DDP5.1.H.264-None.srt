1
00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:07,839
>>> HAPPY BIRTHDAY.

2
00:00:11,143 --> 00:00:14,307
HAPPY 30th BIRTHDAY, MATTHEW,
MAKE A WISH.

3
00:00:14,307 --> 00:00:15,831
>> OKAY.

4
00:00:16,039 --> 00:00:19,387
GOSH, THANKS SO MUCH, KELSEY,
THIS MEANS SO MUCH TO ME,

5
00:00:19,387 --> 00:00:21,789
ESPECIALLY WITH EVERYTHING GOING
ON IN THE WORLD,

6
00:00:21,789 --> 00:00:25,350
GOVERNMENT
SHUTDOWN, AI, JUST SO MUCH
UNCERTAINTY.

7
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:29,049
BUT THE FACT MY BEAUTIFUL WIFE

8
00:00:29,049 --> 00:00:30,936
MEANS A LOT.

9
00:00:31,705 --> 00:00:33,416
>> WELL, OF COURSE.

10
00:00:33,416 --> 00:00:37,139
HEY, MATT, LOOKS LIKE SOME
SPECIAL GUESTS JUST ARRIVED.

11
00:00:37,139 --> 00:00:40,045
>> OH, MY GOD, KELSEY, DID YOU
FLY OUT MY BEST FRIENDS?

12
00:00:40,045 --> 00:00:43,623

14
00:00:48,671 --> 00:00:52,935
FOR THOSE OF YOU HAVE HAVEN'T

15
00:00:52,935 --> 00:00:55,040
WE WENT TO NURSING SCHOOL TOGETHER

16
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:57,192
BUT I DIDN'T GRADUATE.

17
00:00:57,192 --> 00:01:00,431
HELP

DIDN'T
I GOT MY BFF DEGREE

BECAUSE I MET KELSEY'S BESTIES, AKA THE
KELSQUAD.

22
00:01:12,354 --> 00:01:14,759
HEY

23
00:01:14,759 --> 00:01:18,867
>> OH, IT'S MY BIRTHDAY BUT YOUR
FRIENDS ARE GIVING A SPEECH.

24
00:01:18,867 --> 00:01:20,468
SO GOOD.

25
00:01:20,468 --> 00:01:24,120
>> LAST MONTH, KELSEY ASKED YOU
TO GO ON A TRIP WITH HER

26
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:27,940
TO FIND
THE MOST MAGICAL BIRTHDAY
PRESENT FOR MATTHEW.

27
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:31,908
>> THEY SAY DISNEY'S THE MOST
MAGICAL PLACE ON EARTH.

28
00:01:31,908 --> 00:01:36,515
>> BUT WE'RE BANNED FROM THERE,
SO WE WENT TO NASHVILLE.

29
00:01:39,298 --> 00:01:43,536
¶ OUR KELSEY CALLED US BECAUSE
SHE WANTED TO ¶

30
00:01:43,536 --> 00:01:47,961
¶ FIND A REALLY GOOD GIFT FOR
MATTHEW ¶

31
00:01:48,841 --> 00:01:53,157
¶ WE WERE AVAILABLE BECAUSE WE
LOVE HER ¶

32
00:01:53,157 --> 00:01:57,934
¶ AND BECAUSE WE WANTED THE
DELTA POINTS ¶

33
00:01:57,934 --> 00:02:00,236
>> WOW, YOU LADIES SURE LOVE
TRAVELING TOGETHER.

34
00:02:00,236 --> 00:02:02,342
WHY ARE YOUR SCHEDULES SO OPEN?

35
00:02:02,342 --> 00:02:06,553
¶ AND KELSEY SET ONE BOUNDARY

36
00:02:06,553 --> 00:02:10,479
SHE SAID THIS TRIP ¶
¶ WAS MEANT TO BE

37
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:12,987
JUST ABOUT A
GIFT FOR MATT ¶

38
00:02:12,987 --> 00:02:15,102
AND NOT NOT ABOUT ABOUT

39
00:02:15,102 --> 00:02:20,713
SEEING THE ONE ¶
¶ GUY SHE WAS THINKING OF ¶

40
00:02:20,713 --> 00:02:23,595
>> WHO WERE YOU THINKING OF?
>> YOU, DUMMY.

41
00:02:23,595 --> 00:02:26,619
BUT I NEEDED TO FOCUS ON GETTING
YOU AN AWESOME GIFT.

42
00:02:26,619 --> 00:02:31,550
>> BUT I OPENED MY GIFT ALREADY.
YOU GOT ME A HOODIE FROM HUDSON
NEWS.

43
00:02:32,034 --> 00:02:33,936
¶ WHILE WE WENT OUT

44
00:02:33,936 --> 00:02:35,872
KELS SAT ALONE IN THE HOTEL ¶

45
00:02:35,872 --> 00:02:37,822
¶ AND SAID I DON'T REALLY FEEL
WELL ¶

46
00:02:37,822 --> 00:02:41,549
¶ I NEED TO BE ALONE

47
00:02:41,549 --> 00:02:43,570
WHEN WE GOT HOME ¶

48
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:45,630
¶ WE PULLED BACK ALL OF THE
COVERS ¶

49
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:47,479
¶ AND WE SAW THAT THERE WAS JUST

50
00:02:47,479 --> 00:02:51,077
A PUNCH OF PILLOWS ¶

51
00:02:51,077 --> 00:02:55,600
¶ WE CHECKED IN WITH THE FRONT
DESK THEY SAID SHE LEFT ¶

52
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:59,177
¶ IN A BIKINI ABOUT FOUR HOURS
AGO ¶

53
00:02:59,177 --> 00:03:02,155
¶ SHE WAS HOLDING TWO GRAND IN CASH

54
00:03:02,155 --> 00:03:07,689
AND SHE ¶
¶ ONLY CHOSE TO BRING HER BURNER
PHONE ¶

55
00:03:07,689 --> 00:03:12,326
¶ ONE NIGHT WITH DOMINGO ¶

56
00:03:14,006 --> 00:03:17,702
>> OKAY, SO DOMINGO WAS IN
NASHVILLE?

57
00:03:17,702 --> 00:03:19,867
>> YOU COULD HAVE COME ON THE
TRIP, BABE.

58
00:03:19,867 --> 00:03:24,035
>> NO I COULDN'T, I WAS IN
ALBANY ATTENDING A SELF-WORTH
SEMINAR.

59
00:03:24,035 --> 00:03:26,357
>> OUR NASHVILLE TRIP WAS MAGIC.

60
00:03:26,357 --> 00:03:29,048
LIKE DID SOMEONE SAY
ABRACADABRA?

61
00:03:29,048 --> 00:03:31,195
>> NO, NO ONE DID.

62
00:03:31,195 --> 00:03:35,820
>> BABE, I PROMISE, THIS NEXT
SONG WILL NOT BE ABOUT DOMINGO.

63
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:43,538
¶ D-O-M-I-N-G-O DOMINGO ¶
¶ D-O-M-I-N-G-O DOMINGO ¶

KELSEY TELLS HIM I

00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:29,370
BUT BABE, I PROMISE, DOMINGO IS
IN THE PAST.

76
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:31,625

NO, JUST KIDDING, I LIVE VERY
CLOSE BY.

80
00:04:42,281 --> 00:04:46,182
KELSEY, THE NIGHT WE SPENT
TOGETHER IN NASHVILLE

81
00:04:46,182 --> 00:04:49,969
WAS
ANYTHING BUT ORDINARY.

ANY OF YOUR
VOCAL RANGES.

89
00:05:11,597 --> 00:05:14,886
ALSO WHATEVER HAPPENED TO THE

98
00:05:39,203 --> 00:05:42,530

AGAIN.

100
00:05:45,524 --> 00:05:50,327
LIVE FROM NEW YORK, IT'S
SATURDAY NIGHT!

101
00:07:53,962 --> 00:07:59,479

LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, SABRINA
CARPENTER!

103
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:27,804
THANK

104
00:08:27,804 --> 00:08:31,006
I'M SO EXCITED TO BE HERE
HOSTING "SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE."

105
00:08:31,006 --> 00:08:33,185
LAST TIME I WAS HERE FOR THE 50th ANNIVERSARY

106
00:08:33,185 --> 00:08:35,183
WHERE I GOT TO
SING WITH PAUL SIMON.

107
00:08:35,183 --> 00:08:38,222
SINCE THEN, MY NEW ALBUM "MAN'S
BEST FRIEND" CAME OUT,

108
00:08:38,222 --> 00:08:39,736
WHICH I'M
EXCITED ABOUT.

109
00:08:39,736 --> 00:08:42,695
BUT SOME
PEOPLE GOT A LITTLE FREAKED OUT
BY THE COVER.

110
00:08:42,695 --> 00:08:45,257
NOT SURE WHY, IT WAS JUST THIS.

111
00:08:45,257 --> 00:08:48,656
ME ON ALL FOURS WITH AN UNSEEN
FIGURE
PULLING MY HAIR.

112
00:08:48,656 --> 00:08:51,820
BUT WHAT PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE IS
THAT'S JUST HOW THEY CROPPED IT.

113
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:55,540
IF YOU ZOOM OUT, IT'S CLEARLY A
PICTURE FROM THE 50th
ANNIVERSARY SPECIAL

114
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:58,740
OF BOWEN
HELPING ME UP BY THE HAIR.

115
00:09:02,845 --> 00:09:07,203
AFTER MARTIN SHORT SHOVED ME OUT
OF THE BUFFET LINE.

116
00:09:07,203 --> 00:09:11,614
SAYING SOMETHING LIKE
DADDY NEED HIS MINI QUICHE.

117
00:09:11,614 --> 00:09:16,260
NOW SINCE I'M HERE, I WANT TO
CLEAR UP SOME MISCONCEPTIONS
PEOPLE HAVE ABOUT ME.

118
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:19,346
EVERYONE THINKS OF ME AS THIS
HORN-DOG POP STAR.

119
00:09:19,346 --> 00:09:21,060
BUT THERE'S SO MUCH MORE TO ME.

120
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:24,745
I'M NOT JUST HORNY, I'M ALSO
TURNED ON.

121
00:09:24,745 --> 00:09:27,518
I'M SEXUALLY CHARGED.

122
00:09:27,518 --> 00:09:29,980
AND I LOVE TO READ.

123
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:32,773
MY FAVORITE BOOK IS THE
ENCYCLOPEDIA.

124
00:09:32,773 --> 00:09:36,139
IT'S SO BIG AND IT'S HARD --

125
00:09:36,139 --> 00:09:37,719
WAIT, SERIOUSLY. SORRY,

126
00:09:37,719 --> 00:09:41,983
THERE IS A REAL PERSON
UNDER ALL
THE SPARKLES, CORSETS AND WIGS,

127
00:09:41,983 --> 00:09:43,703
ANOTHER THING YOU MIGHT NOT KNOW
ABOUT ME

128
00:09:43,703 --> 00:09:46,668
IS I LOVE TO INTERACT
WITH THE AUDIENCE DURING MY
SHOWS.

129
00:09:46,668 --> 00:09:49,159
I'D LIKE TO DO THAT NOW.

130
00:09:49,159 --> 00:09:52,061
HI, SIR, WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

131
00:09:52,061 --> 00:09:53,649
>> MY NAME IS WILL.

132
00:09:53,649 --> 00:09:57,618
>> WILL, WHAT A SEXY, UNUSUAL
NAME, WILL.

133
00:09:57,618 --> 00:10:00,618
WHERE ARE YOU FROM?
>> MARYLAND.

134
00:10:00,618 --> 00:10:04,783
>> MARYLAND, OH, WHAT A SEXY,
UNUSUAL PLACE.

135
00:10:04,783 --> 00:10:07,391
SEE, I LOVE TALKING TO NORMAL
PEOPLE.

136
00:10:07,391 --> 00:10:09,271
THEY'RE SO FASCINATING WHEN
THEIR REAL.

137
00:10:09,271 --> 00:10:12,057
LIKE YOU SIR, HI, WHAT DO YOU DO
FOR WORK.

138
00:10:12,057 --> 00:10:15,427
>> VENTURE CAPITAL.
>> AWESOME.

139
00:10:17,814 --> 00:10:20,943
BUT HONESTLY, I CAN HAVE
CHEMISTRY WITH LITERALLY
ANYTHING.

140
00:10:20,943 --> 00:10:22,637
LIKE THIS GUY.

141
00:10:23,509 --> 00:10:27,260
I CAN'T WITH YOU, YOU LOOK LIKE
MY BROTHER.

142
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:31,482
I'M GOING BACK UP HERE.

143
00:10:31,951 --> 00:10:34,529
SO ANOTHER FUN THING I LIKE TO
DO AT MY CONCERTS

144
00:10:34,529 --> 00:10:38,073
IS ARREST
SOMEONE FOR BEING HOT.
WHO CAN I ARREST TONIGHT.

145
00:10:38,073 --> 00:10:40,738
>> NOT SO FAST, SABRINA CARPENTER,

146
00:10:40,738 --> 00:10:44,248
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST.
>> FOR BEING HOT?

147
00:10:44,248 --> 00:10:49,780
NO. MORE FOR FALSELY
IMPERSONATING AN OFFICER AT CONCERTS

148
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:52,965
AND ARRESTING HOT
PEOPLE.

149
00:10:52,965 --> 00:10:57,319
>> KENAN, YOU'RE NOT A COP.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HER

150
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,012
FINE

151
00:10:59,012 --> 00:11:01,829
>> I'M HERE FOR A CAMEO FOR MY
NIECE.

152

WHO WANTS TO DRIVE A NICE CAR
AND LIVE IN A GAY COMMUNITY?

483

>> DOES SHE MEAN GATED
COMMUNITY?

484
00:29:02,623 --> 00:29:07,266
>> WHO WANTS TO HAVE A ROCKING
BODY AND BE NEXT DOOR NEIGHBORS

IT STANDS FOR
FEAR OF MISSING OUT ON ME

490
00:29:22,459 --> 00:29:24,530
OR NOT
ON OTHER PEOPLE'S EXPECTATIONS OF ME

491
00:29:24,530 --> 00:29:27,722
WHILE I'M ON THE WAY TO
LIVING MY DREAM LIFE IN THE CAR

>> THANK YOU.
GOOD EVENING EVERYONE.

640
00:38:40,570 --> 00:38:43,550
>> WELCOME TO WEEKEND UPDATE.
I'M MICHAEL CHE.
>> I'M COLIN JOST.

641
00:38:43,550 --> 00:38:47,642
WELL, YESTERDAY PRESIDENT TRUMP
FINALLY RELEASED

642
00:38:47,642 --> 00:38:50,362
WHAT EVERYONE
HAS BEEN ASKING HIM TO RELEASE --

643
00:38:50,362 --> 00:38:52,986
GEORGE SANTOS,

644
00:38:52,986 --> 00:38:55,345
THE FORMER REPUBLICAN CONGRESSMAN

645
00:38:55,345 --> 00:38:57,474
WHO HAD PLED GUILTY TO FRAUD

646
00:38:57,474 --> 00:39:00,789
AND SOMETHING CALLED
AGGRAVATED IDENTITY THEFT.

647
00:39:00,789 --> 00:39:04,722
WHICH I THINK IS WHEN YOU PUSH
SOMEONE IN A CLOSET AND CHANGE
CLOTHES WITH THEM.

648
00:39:04,722 --> 00:39:08,553
IS NOW
FREE AND WILL FACE ZERO
CONSEQUENCES.

649
00:39:08,553 --> 00:39:11,217
HE'S SAID HE'S A CHANGED MAN

650
00:39:11,217 --> 00:39:15,306
AND ALSO RELEASED A PHOTO OF
HIS NEW PRISON BODY.

651
00:39:16,893 --> 00:39:22,105
>> VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY HAS SAID
IF PRESIDENT TRUMP SUPPLIES
UKRAINE WITH TOMAHAWK MISSILES,

652
00:39:22,105 --> 00:39:24,919
HE WILL NOMINATE TRUMP FOR THE
NOBEL PEACE PRIZE.

653
00:39:24,919 --> 00:39:28,602
YOU KNOW, THE PRIZE THEY GIVE
YOU FOR SELLING MISSILES.

654
00:39:28,602 --> 00:39:33,525
THERE WAS OUTRAGE THIS WEEK
OVER A LEAKED GROUP CHAT BETWEEN
REPUBLICAN LEADERS

655
00:39:33,525 --> 00:39:38,075
WHICH PRAISED
HITLER AND REFERRED TO BLACK
AMERICANS AS WATERMELON PEOPLE.

656
00:39:38,075 --> 00:39:41,133
THE CHAT WAS NAMED JOST FAMILY.

657
00:39:46,071 --> 00:39:48,428
>> WHAT DID I DO TO YOU?

658
00:39:48,428 --> 00:39:52,548
>> WHILE TRAVELING ON AIR FORCE
ONE TO THE MIDDLE EAST TO
CELEBRATE THE CEASEFIRE,

659
00:39:52,548 --> 00:39:57,691
PRESIDENT TRUMP TOLD REPORTERS,
I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANYTHING
THAT'S GOING TO GET ME INTO
HEAVEN.

660
00:39:57,691 --> 00:40:00,534
THEN HE PAUSED FOR TEN FULL MINUTES

661
00:40:00,534 --> 00:40:03,979
WAITING FOR SOMEONE TO
SAY THAT'S NOT TRUE.

662
00:40:03,979 --> 00:40:06,374
BECAUSE TRUMP CAN'T GO TO HEAVEN,

663
00:40:06,374 --> 00:40:10,584
HE'S FAR TOO BUSY DOWN
HERE, RUNNING HELL.

664
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:15,914
>> PRESIDENT TRUMP ANNOUNCED
THAT ANOTHER ALLEGED DRUG
SMUGGLING BOAT FROM VENEZUELA

665
00:40:15,914 --> 00:40:18,431
HAS BEEN BLOWN OUT OF THE WATER
WITHOUT WARNING.

666
00:40:18,431 --> 00:40:21,208
YOU MAY NOT THINK THAT'S A BIG
DEAL RIGHT NOW,

667
00:40:21,208 --> 00:40:24,915
BUT ONE DAY SOON
YOU'LL LOOK AT YOURSELF IN THE
MIRROR AND REALIZE --

668
00:40:24,915 --> 00:40:27,353
YOU'RE OUT
OF COCAINE.

669
00:40:30,457 --> 00:40:33,300
PRESIDENT TRUMP CRITICIZED
TIME MAGAZINE

670
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:36,222
FOR USING A BAD
PICTURE OF HIM ON THE COVER,

671
00:40:36,222 --> 00:40:39,819
SAYING QUOTE, THEY DISAPPEARED
MY HAIR.

672
00:40:39,819 --> 00:40:44,091
AND I GOT TO AGREE.
THAT THING DO LOOK WAXED.

673
00:40:49,754 --> 00:40:52,097
>> JOHN BOLTON, WHO WANTS PEOPLE

674
00:40:52,097 --> 00:40:55,668
STOP COMING UP TO HIM TO ORDER CHICKEN,

675
00:40:55,668 --> 00:41:01,227
HAS BECOME THE THIRD
PERSON ON PRESIDENT TRUMP'S
ENEMIES LIST TO BE INDICTED.

676
00:41:01,227 --> 00:41:03,027
AND YOU KNOW YOU AREN'T LIVING
YOUR LIFE RIGHT

677
00:41:03,027 --> 00:41:05,987
WHEN YOU KEEP AN
ACTUAL LIST OF YOUR ENEMIES.

678
00:41:05,987 --> 00:41:08,837
AT LEAST THAT'S WHAT MY
THERAPIST TOLD ME.

679
00:41:08,837 --> 00:41:12,255
SO NOW SHE'S ON THE LIST, TOO.

680
00:41:14,178 --> 00:41:16,439
HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE IN PORTLAND

681
00:41:16,439 --> 00:41:19,199
SENT A MESSAGE TO I.C.E. TO LEAVE THEIR CITY

682
00:41:19,199 --> 00:41:22,188
BY RIDING THEIR
BIKES NAKED THROUGH THE RAIN.

683
00:41:22,188 --> 00:41:26,085
AND YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BELIEVE
IT, IT DIDN'T WORK.

684
00:41:28,551 --> 00:41:34,318
>> A NEW REPORT SHOWS THAT OF
THE NEARLY 100 TRUMP NOMINEES
CONFIRMED BY THE SENATE,

685
00:41:34,318 --> 00:41:36,249
ONLY
TWO OF THEM WERE BLACK.

686
00:41:36,249 --> 00:41:38,031
TWO BLACK PEOPLE OUT OF 100.

687
00:41:38,031 --> 00:41:40,677
I MEAN WHAT THIS IS, MY TINDER
MATCHES?

688
00:41:41,614 --> 00:41:43,522
NOPE.

689
00:41:43,522 --> 00:41:45,217
>> I LIKED IT.

690
00:41:45,217 --> 00:41:48,067
ARGENTINE PRESIDENT JAVIER MILEI,

691
00:41:48,067 --> 00:41:51,961
SEEN ASKING IF HE MAKES
YOU HORNY BABY,

692
00:41:51,961 --> 00:41:55,684
MET WITH
PRESIDENT TRUMP AT THE WHITE
HOUSE THIS WEEK,

693
00:41:55,684 --> 00:42:00,189
WHERE TRUMP
ANNOUNCED THAT HE'S SENDING $40
BILLION TO ARGENTINA,

694
00:42:00,189 --> 00:42:02,004
BECAUSE IF
HISTORY IS ANY GUIDE,

695
00:42:02,004 --> 00:42:06,586
A LOT OF
TRUMP OFFICIALS WILL END UP
FLEEING TO ARGENTINA.

696
00:42:09,232 --> 00:42:11,943
HEY, ONE CLAP.

697
00:42:12,770 --> 00:42:15,179
JUST KIDDING.

698
00:42:15,179 --> 00:42:20,705
IN THE CLINCHING GAME OF THE
NLCS, DODGERS STAR SHOHEI OHTANI

699
00:42:20,705 --> 00:42:24,084
PITCHED SIX SCORELESS INNINGS,
STRUCK OUT TEN BATTERS

700
00:42:24,084 --> 00:42:25,983
AND HIT THREE HOME RUNS,

701
00:42:25,983 --> 00:42:30,116
A FEAT
PREVIOUSLY ONLY ACCOMPLISHED

702
00:42:30,116 --> 00:42:32,648
BY
GEORGE SANTOS.

703
00:42:33,693 --> 00:42:38,311
>> DURING THE FIRST NEW YORK
MAYORAL DEBATE, ANDREW CUOMO
ATTACKED ZOHRAN MAMDANI.

704
00:42:38,311 --> 00:42:43,083
SAYING THAT HE ONCE GAVE THE
FINGER TO THE COLUMBUS DAY STATUE,

705
00:42:43,083 --> 00:42:47,434
WHEREAS CUOMO SNUCK UP
BEHIND THE STATUE AND GRABBED
IT BY THE HIPS.

706
00:42:50,184 --> 00:42:52,601
>> HALLOWEEN IS RIGHT AROUND THE
CORNER.

707
00:42:52,601 --> 00:42:55,202
IT'S SCARY MOVIE SEASON.

708

710
00:43:08,727 --> 00:43:12,816
I'M HERE TALKING ABOUT SCARY
MOVIES.

711
00:43:15,940 --> 00:43:18,463
>> OKAY.

712
00:43:18,463 --> 00:43:22,542
MOVIE GUY, LET'S START WITH
BLACK PHONE 2, JUST CAME OUT
THIS WEEKEND.

713
00:43:22,542 --> 00:43:24,669
>> OH, YEAH, "BLACK PHONE 2,"

714
00:43:24,669 --> 00:43:26,332
RING RING, HELLO,

00:43:28,115 --> 00:43:31,212
BECAUSE I HAVE NOT SEEN THAT ONE
YET.

717
00:43:32,519 --> 00:43:34,967
>> OKAY, WELL I GUESS IT
JUST CAME OUT.

718
00:43:34,967 --> 00:43:37,267
WHAT ABOUT THE BIGGEST HORROR
MOVIE OF THE YEAR,
WEAPONS.

719
00:43:37,267 --> 00:43:40,973
>> YEAH, "WEAPONS," THAT WAS A
VERY BIG MOVIE.

720
00:43:40,973 --> 00:43:44,539
EVERYBODY SAW "WEAPONS," AND I
HAVE TO TELL YOU,

721
00:43:44,539 --> 00:43:47,392
I WAS
NOT ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE.

722
00:43:47,392 --> 00:43:49,842
>> DO YOU EVEN LIKE SCARY
MOVIES?

723
00:43:49,842 --> 00:43:51,827
>> I LOVE SCARY MOVIES

724
00:43:51,827 --> 00:43:54,950
BECAUSE IN THE TITLE THEY TELL YOU WHAT
GOING TO HAPPEN.

725
00:43:54,950 --> 00:43:58,767
LIKE "SCREAM."
EVERYBODY SCREAM.

726
00:43:59,103 --> 00:44:02,326
SMILE, EVERYBODY SMILE.

727
00:44:02,326 --> 00:44:05,340
AND "SAW."
EVERYBODY SAW

728
00:44:05,340 --> 00:44:08,947
EXCEPT ME, I DID
NOT SEE "SAW."

729
00:44:10,452 --> 00:44:14,842
>> HOW ABOUT CLASSIC HORROR
MOVIES LIKE "THE EXORCIST"?

730
00:44:16,190 --> 00:44:20,528
>> THAT'S ABOUT A SCARY CHILD.

731
00:44:20,528 --> 00:44:23,628
YOU KNOW WHO IS THE SCARIEST
CHILD?

732
00:44:23,628 --> 00:44:25,478
STEWIE.

733
00:44:26,468 --> 00:44:28,835
>> WHO?
>> STEWIE.

734
00:44:28,835 --> 00:44:32,285
>> TOOEY?

735

HIS FATHER IS FAT, HIS MOTHER IS SKINNY,

736
00:44:37,072 --> 00:44:39,948
AND SHE ALWAYS GETTING
MAD AT HIM.

737
00:44:39,948 --> 00:44:41,459
I CAN SEE WHY,

738
00:44:41,459 --> 00:44:46,183
HIS HEAD LOOKS
LIKE A VAGINA DESTROYER.

739
00:44:47,258 --> 00:44:50,086
>> WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

740
00:44:50,086 --> 00:44:53,263
>> I'M TALKING ABOUT SCARY
MOVIES MAN.

>> WHAT MOVIE IS REALLY SCARY,

742
00:44:55,620 --> 00:44:57,515
THE ONE WITH
MICHAEL MYERS.

743
00:44:57,515 --> 00:45:00,102
>> "HALLOWEEN."

744
00:45:00,102 --> 00:45:04,981
>> NO, "SHREK."

745
00:45:04,981 --> 00:45:09,458
THIS MOVIE IS ABOUT EVERY MAN'S
BIGGEST FEAR.

746
00:45:09,458 --> 00:45:12,784
YOU GO TO SLEEP WITH A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN

747
00:45:12,784 --> 00:45:17,365
AND THEN YOU WAKE UP AND
GO HOW DRUNK WAS I LAST NIGHT?

748
00:45:18,046 --> 00:45:21,385
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT,
COLIN.
YOU KNOW.

749
00:45:21,385 --> 00:45:23,242
YOU KNOW.

750
00:45:23,242 --> 00:45:25,363
>> LEAVE ME OUT OF THIS, OKAY?

751
00:45:25,363 --> 00:45:27,458
CAN WE FOCUS ON SCARY MOVIES.

752
00:45:27,458 --> 00:45:31,025
"I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST"
SUMMER."
>> WHAT DID I DO?

753
00:45:31,025 --> 00:45:35,716
>> I DON'T KNOW.
>> SO WHOA WOULD YOU SAY
SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

754
00:45:35,716 --> 00:45:40,134
>> WHAT ABOUT THE MOVIE "IT"?
>> I DID NOT SEE THAT.

755
00:45:42,677 --> 00:45:47,192
>> "ALIEN"?
>> NO COLIN, I'M AN AMERICAN
CITIZEN.

756
00:45:50,556 --> 00:45:55,002
>> ALL RIGHT.
MOVIE GUY, I FEEL LIKE I
SHOULD HAVE SAID THIS TWO
MINUTES AGO,

757
00:45:55,002 --> 00:45:57,031
BUT IT'S
TIME TO WRAP THIS UP.

758
00:45:57,031 --> 00:46:02,137

BUT BEFORE I GO, CAN I DO A
JOKE?

759
00:46:02,137 --> 00:46:05,830

SCARY MOVIE FROM 2008.
OKAY?

761

THE MOVIE IS CALLED "ONE MISSED
CALL."

762
00:46:14,633 --> 00:46:17,118
IN THIS MOVIE, THE PHONE RINGS,

763
00:46:17,118 --> 00:46:19,771
AND IF YOU DON'T PICK IT UP, YOU
DIE.

764
00:46:19,771 --> 00:46:24,785
AND I'M LIKE, IS THIS MOVIE
ABOUT MY MOTHER?

765
00:46:24,785 --> 00:46:26,816
AM I RIGHT, GUYS?

766
00:46:26,816 --> 00:46:30,525
>> MOVIE GUY, EVERYONE.

WITH KING CHARLES ABOUT HIS
FRIENDSHIP WITH JEFFREY EPSTEIN,

779
00:47:29,779 --> 00:47:32,710
HE WILL STOP USING HIS ROYAL
TITLE DUKE OF YORK

780
00:47:32,710 --> 00:47:36,947
AND INSTEAD
WILL GO BY THE KING OF
QUINCEANERAS.

781
00:47:40,184 --> 00:47:42,848
I'M PROUD OF THAT JOKE.

INTO A MAN WHO LIVED FOR 171
DAYS AFTER THE PROCEDURE.

789
00:48:10,227 --> 00:48:12,795
THE LIVER WILL NOW BE SENT TO A
SPECIAL FACILITY

00:48:35,718 --> 00:48:38,911
>> HI COLIN.
>> TOMMY, WELCOME.

797
00:48:38,911 --> 00:48:41,235
SO YOU JUST MOVED TO NEW YORK.
WHAT DO YOU THINK SO FAR?

798
00:48:41,340 --> 00:48:43,360
>> IT'S A LITTLE DIFFERENT FROM
HOME.

799
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:46,637
I'M FROM THE MIDWEST, I DON'T
KNOW IF YOU CAN TELL FROM MY KIND EYES

800
00:48:46,637 --> 00:48:48,978

>> EIGHT KIDS, WOW, YOU DO NOT
SEE THAT A LOT.

803
00:48:55,146 --> 00:48:59,487
>> PROBABLY BECAUSE IT'S THE
WRONG CHOICE.

804
00:48:59,487 --> 00:49:01,821
EIGHT IS TOO MANY KIDS.

805
00:49:01,821 --> 00:49:06,327
YOU KNOW HOW I KNOW THAT?
WE HAD A CAFETERIA STYLE MILK
MACHINE AT HOME.

806
00:49:06,327 --> 00:49:10,575
WE HAD A MILK MAN.
TIM THE MILK MAN WAS A BIG PART
OF MY LIFE.

807
00:49:10,575 --> 00:49:13,909
HE'D SHOW UP,
REPLACE THE MILK, PLAY CATCH,
CALL ME SON.

MUCH LIKE YOU?

809
00:49:17,472 --> 00:49:20,813
>> SOUNDS LIKE YOU GREW UP IN
THE 1930s.

810
00:49:20,813 --> 00:49:24,225
>> WELL, I DIDN'T, BUT I LOOK
LIKE I DID.

811
00:49:24,225 --> 00:49:29,117
I LOOK LIKE A LOCKET PHOTO
DURING WORLD WAR I.

812
00:49:29,117 --> 00:49:34,502
I LOOK LIKE A GUY WHO WAS REALLY
GOOD AT FOOTBALL PREINTEGRATION.

813
00:49:37,792 --> 00:49:41,980
I WILL SAY I THINK THE WAY I
GREW UP

814
00:49:41,980 --> 00:49:43,667
HAS REALLY HELPED ME
ADJUST TO NEW YORK.

815
00:49:43,667 --> 00:49:46,651
EVERYONE SAYS PUBLIC TRANSIT IS
WILD.

816
00:49:46,651 --> 00:49:50,417
FOR MY ENTIRE CHILDHOOD THE TEN
OF US RODE

817
00:49:50,417 --> 00:49:52,876
IN A SEVEN-SEATER
CHEVY ASTRO VAN.

818
00:49:52,876 --> 00:49:56,778
SO ANYWHERE WE DROVE IT LOOKED
LIKE WE WERE BEING TRAFFICKED.

819
00:49:56,778 --> 00:49:59,508
LOVE SUBWAY.
I CAN HANG.

820
00:49:59,602 --> 00:50:01,860
WATCHING PEOPLE JUMP OVER THE
TURNSTILES,

821
00:50:01,860 --> 00:50:06,186
AND TODAY I WORKED
UP THE COURAGE AND JUMPED OVER
MY FIRST ONE.

822
00:50:06,186 --> 00:50:09,051
>> CONGRATS,

823
00:50:09,051 --> 00:50:10,227
BUDDY, JUMPED YOUR FIRST
TURNSTILE.

824
00:50:10,227 --> 00:50:13,588
>> IT WAS COOL, IT WAS
EXHILARATING AND THRILLING.

825
00:50:13,588 --> 00:50:17,003
IT WAS ON THE WAY OUT BUT I

826
00:50:17,766 --> 00:50:20,967
-- IT FELT GOOD, IT COUNTS.

827
00:50:20,967 --> 00:50:24,320
>> IT STILL COUNTS.
YOU'RE A GOOD BOY.

828
00:50:26,702 --> 00:50:28,680
>> SURE.
YEAH.

829
00:50:28,680 --> 00:50:31,293
I'M A GOOD BOY.

830
00:50:31,626 --> 00:50:35,473
I'M JUST REALLY SCARED OF BEING
IN TROUBLE ALL THE TIME

831
00:50:35,473 --> 00:50:36,788
BECAUSE
I GREW UP CATHOLIC.

832
00:50:36,788 --> 00:50:41,241
I GREW UP FEELING GUILTY BUT
NEVER KNEW WHAT FOR.

833
00:50:41,241 --> 00:50:45,655
IF YOU GREW UP CATHOLIC, ONLY
SINS YOU KNOW

834
00:50:45,655 --> 00:50:47,694
ARE LIKE BREAKING
THE TEN COMMANDMENTS --

835
00:50:47,694 --> 00:50:51,585
DON'T STEAL,
DON'T KILL, RIGHT TO CARRY WEAPONS 
OR WHATEVER.

836
00:50:51,585 --> 00:50:55,704
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY IN
CONFESSION.

837
00:50:55,704 --> 00:50:57,456
COULDN'T CONFESS TO THE ONE SIN

838
00:50:57,456 --> 00:51:01,327
ME AND EVERY OTHER 12-YEAR-OLD
BOY WERE COMMITTING CONSTANTLY,

839
00:51:01,327 --> 00:51:04,877
WHAT I REFERRED TO THEM AS TOMMY
TIME.

840
00:51:05,109 --> 00:51:09,074
YOU KNOW, SHUCKING MY CORN.
>> YEP.

841
00:51:09,427 --> 00:51:13,711
>> AT CONFESSION COULDN'T BE
LIKE
I'VE BEEN GOING TO TOWN ON
MYSELF LATELY.

842
00:51:13,711 --> 00:51:17,455
IT'S ALL I DO.
CONSUMING MY LIFE, FATHER.

843
00:51:17,455 --> 00:51:19,508
IF I WASN'T IN HERE, THAT'S WHAT
I WOULD BE DOING.

844
00:51:19,508 --> 00:51:23,826
CAN'T SAY THAT BECAUSE HE WOULD
BE LIKE YOU CAN DO IT IN HERE,
I'M DOING IT.

845
00:51:23,826 --> 00:51:26,948
>> TOMMY BRENNAN, EVERYONE.
>> I'M SORRY.

MAKES A REGULAR DAY FEEL
SPECIAL.

904
00:56:18,123 --> 00:56:20,842
>> EVERY DAY IS SPECIAL WHEN I'M
WORKING WITH MY CRUSH.

905
00:56:20,842 --> 00:56:24,021
>> LIZ, YOU KNOW I'M MARRIED TO
A MODEL.

906
00:56:24,795 --> 00:56:27,188
>> OKAY, ESH, SHE'S COMING.

>> SURPRISE!
>> DON'T HURT ME!

909
00:56:47,058 --> 00:56:49,876
OH, GOD.

910
00:56:50,287 --> 00:56:52,710
OH, GOD.

911
00:57:13,319 --> 00:57:17,751
HAPPY?

912
00:57:19,348 --> 00:57:24,548
>> I'M SORRY, LAURA, WE JUST
WANTED TO DO SOMETHING SPECIAL
FOR YOUR BIRTHDAY.

913
00:57:24,548 --> 00:57:26,071

I'M FEELING PRETTY SPECIAL RIGHT NOW.
WHAT?

915
00:57:30,101 --> 00:57:32,227
>> SORRY, WE THOUGHT YOU'D LIKE
IT.

916
00:57:32,227 --> 00:57:34,167
>> YOU THOUGHT I'D LIKE WHAT,

917
00:57:34,167 --> 00:57:38,891
WALKING INTO A DARK ROOM
THINKING I'M BEING ATTACKED?
I ALMOST PASSED OUT.

918
00:57:38,891 --> 00:57:42,576
>> I THINK YOU JUST GOT SCARED
AND FARTED A LITTLE.

919
00:57:42,576 --> 00:57:46,107
>> OKAY, CAN WE JUST WORK?

920
00:57:46,107 --> 00:57:49,908
>> LET'S START THE MEETING.
I THINK THAT'S A GREAT IDEA.

921
00:57:49,908 --> 00:57:52,586
>> I MEAN IS THIS WHAT YOU GUYS
WANTED, HUH,

922
00:57:52,586 --> 00:57:56,245
TO SEE ME LOSE FULL
CONTROL OF MY BODY?

923
00:57:56,245 --> 00:57:58,487
>> LAURA, WE'RE SORRY.

924
00:57:58,487 --> 00:58:01,615
>> HE I MEAN
WHERE DO YOU EVEN GET AN IDEA
FOR SOMETHING LIKE THIS?

925
00:58:01,615 --> 00:58:05,380
>> IT'S ACTUALLY A COMMON THING.
MOST PEOPLE LAUGH.

926
00:58:05,380 --> 00:58:10,508
I MEAN I LAUGHED, TOO, I GUESS,
JUST NOT OUT OF MY MOUTH.

927
00:58:10,508 --> 00:58:13,592
WHO DO I SEND THE THANK YOU NOTE
TO, EVERYONE OR?

928
00:58:13,592 --> 00:58:17,109
>> WE'RE SORRY, MOST PEOPLE LIKE
IT.
LET'S JUST PUT IT BEHIND US.

929
00:58:17,109 --> 00:58:20,159
>> NO,
SINCE EVERYONE LIKES IT SO MUCH,
LET'S SEE

930
00:58:20,159 --> 00:58:24,440
JEN, COME IN HERE PLEASE.

CAN SLEEP TONIGHT?

937
00:58:51,145 --> 00:58:52,545
>> IT WAS MINE.

938
00:58:52,545 --> 00:58:55,514
>> I KNEW IT, YOU'VE BEEN OUT
FOR ME SINCE THE BEGINNING.

939
00:58:55,514 --> 00:58:56,817
>> I STARTED A WEEK AGO.

940
00:58:56,817 --> 00:58:59,472
>> YOU WANT MY JOB AND YOU'VE
MADE THAT VERY CLEAR.

941
00:58:59,472 --> 00:59:01,390
>> I THINK I'M ABOVE YOU.

942
00:59:01,390 --> 00:59:03,302
>> YOU ARE?
>> I THINK SO.

943
00:59:03,302 --> 00:59:06,779
>> IS THAT REAL, IS THAT TRUE?
>> I THINK WE ALL ARE.

944
00:59:06,779 --> 00:59:11,351
>> SINCE WHEN?
>> OVER TIME WE ALL JUST GOT
PROMOTED.

945
00:59:11,351 --> 00:59:15,378
>> BUT I THOUGHT I WAS RIGHT
UNDER THE CEO.
>> WHY WOULD YOU THINK THAT?

946
00:59:15,378 --> 00:59:19,754
>> I'M THE CSO, IT SAYS IT ON
MY MUG YOU GUYS GAVE ME.

947
00:59:19,754 --> 00:59:22,502
>> THAT STANDS FOR CHIEF SNACK
OFFICER.

948
00:59:22,502 --> 00:59:26,511
IT WAS A JOKE BECAUSE YOU'RE
ADDICTED TO VEGGIE STRAWS.

949
00:59:26,511 --> 00:59:30,188
>> OH, HOW MUCH DO YOU GUYS
MAKE?
>> WE'RE NOT DOING THAT.

950
00:59:30,188 --> 00:59:33,189
>> HOW MUCH YOU MAKE?
>> I'M NOT SAYING.

951
00:59:33,506 --> 00:59:37,428
>> HEY, HOW MUCH YOU MAKE?
>> YOU NEED TO STOP.

952
00:59:37,428 --> 00:59:40,606
>> OKAY FINE, RAISE
YOUR HAND IF YOU MAKE MORE THAN
$9.50 AN HOUR.

953
00:59:40,606 --> 00:59:42,368
>> YOU'RE NOT EVEN SALARIED?

954
00:59:42,368 --> 00:59:45,400
>> WHAT EVEN IS THAT.
CAN I STILL FIRE PEOPLE?

955
00:59:45,400 --> 00:59:47,657
>> YOU WERE NEVER ALLOWED TO
FIRE PEOPLE.

956
00:59:47,657 --> 00:59:50,309
>> COOL.
GREAT BIRTHDAY, EVERYBODY.

957
00:59:50,309 --> 00:59:52,172
FARTED AND GOT DEMOTED.

958
00:59:52,172 --> 00:59:56,873
>> YOU WEREN'T DEMOTED, YOU JUST
LEARNED WHAT YOUR JOB IS.

959
00:59:56,873 --> 01:00:00,780
>> THEN I GUESS I JUST FARTED.

960
01:00:00,780 --> 01:00:03,087
I GOT TO GO.

961
01:00:03,351 --> 01:00:07,644
>> HEY, LAURA, IT'S YOUR
BIRTHDAY.
YOU DESERVE A REAL GIFT.

962
01:00:07,644 --> 01:00:11,007
IS THERE ANYTHING WE CAN DO TO
MAKE YOU HAPPY, MAKE UP FOR ALL
THIS?

963
01:00:11,007 --> 01:00:14,075
ANYTHING?

967
01:00:23,945 --> 01:00:26,491
>> AND STOCK OPTIONS.

968
01:00:26,491 --> 01:00:30,674
>> OKAY, GUYS, WE HAVE GOT TO
GET OUT OF THIS ROOM.

969
01:00:30,674 --> 01:00:33,552
>> WHO IS READY FOR CAKE?

970
01:00:33,552 --> 01:00:35,470
>> NO!

971
01:00:35,470 --> 01:00:36,668
>> WHAT?

972
01:00:36,668 --> 01:00:41,163
>> I THINK WE THOUGHT THE
OFFICE
WAS GOING TO BLOW UP BECAUSE OF
ALL THE --

NOT ANYONE LEFT FOR ME
TO BELIEVE IN ¶

1021
01:04:17,670 --> 01:04:19,587
SOCIAL

1022
01:04:20,362 --> 01:04:23,691
KNOW
BUT GROWING UP I WAS ALWAYS TOLD

1023
01:04:23,691 --> 01:04:25,601
TO NEVER JUDGE A BOOK BY ITS
COVER.

1024
01:04:25,601 --> 01:04:27,690
BUT WHEN I WATCHED THE NEWS,

1025
01:04:27,690 --> 01:04:31,307
I FEEL LIKE NOBODY ELSE REMEMBERS
THAT LESSON.

1026
01:04:36,065 --> 01:04:39,127
>> NO TEETH.
>> YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT TEETH.

1027
01:04:39,615 --> 01:04:43,881
>> SO I WANTED TO PUT THAT TO
THE TEST TONIGHT WITH A LITTLE
SOCIAL EXPERIMENT.

1028
01:04:43,881 --> 01:04:46,839
I FILLED A THEATER WITH
PROFESSIONAL ACTORS

1029
01:04:46,839 --> 01:04:50,137
DRESSED TO
LOOK STEREOTYPICALLY DANGEROUS
OR SCARY.

1030
01:04:50,137 --> 01:04:54,359
NOT THE TYPE ONE MIGHT EXPECT TO
ENCOUNTER IN AN UPSCALE
NEIGHBORHOOD.

1031
01:04:54,359 --> 01:04:57,646
I WANTED TO SEE IF PEOPLE WOULD
JUDGE THEM BASED ON THEIR
APPEARANCE.

1032
01:04:57,646 --> 01:05:00,584
AND WHAT I FOUND FRANKLY
DISAPPOINTED ME.

1033
01:05:00,584 --> 01:05:03,935
OKAY.
FIRST GUY IS GOING IN.

1034
01:05:22,102 --> 01:05:23,690
NOT

1035
01:05:23,690 --> 01:05:27,530
THEIR APPEARANCES.

1036
01:05:30,806 --> 01:05:35,071
EVEN THIS LADY, WHO I THOUGHT
WOULD BE WOKE BECAUSE OF THE
HAIRCUT.

1037
01:05:35,703 --> 01:05:38,963
MISS, MISS, WHY DID YOU LEAVE
THAT MOVIE THEATER?

1038
01:05:38,963 --> 01:05:41,383
>> BECAUSE EVERYONE WAS DRESSED
AS FRANKENSTEIN,

1039
01:05:41,383 --> 01:05:44,759
AND THE MOVIE I
WANTED TO SEE DOES NOT HAVE
FRANKENSTEIN IN IT.

1040
01:05:44,759 --> 01:05:48,762
>> WOW, SO YOU ASSUMED THEY WERE
THERE TO SEE A MOVIE ABOUT FRANKENSTEIN

1041
01:05:48,762 --> 01:05:50,834
JUST BECAUSE OF THE
COLOR OF THEIR SKIN?

1042
01:05:50,834 --> 01:05:53,128
>> THE COLOR OF THEIR SKIN WAS
GREEN.

1043
01:05:53,128 --> 01:05:55,335
>> SHE JUST SAID THE QUIET PART
OUT LOUD.

1044
01:05:55,335 --> 01:05:56,402
RACIST

1045
01:05:56,402 --> 01:05:59,273
IF YOU WALKED INTO THE THEATER
TO SEE THE FANTASTIC 4

1046
01:05:59,273 --> 01:06:03,137
AND THE
WHOLE AUDIENCE WAS ASIAN, WHAT
WOULD YOU ASSUME THEN?

1047
01:06:03,137 --> 01:06:05,645
>> WHAT WOULD YOU ASSUME?

1048
01:06:07,021 --> 01:06:08,743
>> SLIGHTLY PROBLEMATIC.

1049
01:06:08,743 --> 01:06:10,537
>> EVERYONE WAS FAILING MY TEST

1050
01:06:10,537 --> 01:06:13,818
AND BEFORE LONG MY FRANKENSTEINS
WERE STARTING TO LOSE FAITH.

1051
01:06:13,818 --> 01:06:15,754
EVEN MY OWN GIRLFRIEND FAILED

1052
01:06:15,754 --> 01:06:19,258
WHEN I PERFORMED THE SAME
EXPERIMENT IN HER APARTMENT.

1053
01:06:20,045 --> 01:06:22,430
>> WE BROKE UP THREE MONTHS AGO.

1054
01:06:22,430 --> 01:06:23,413
RACIST

1055
01:06:23,413 --> 01:06:25,344
>> AND AS MY EXPERIMENT EVOLVED,

1056
01:06:25,344 --> 01:06:28,290
I FOUND THAT PEOPLE JUDGED
ANYONE WHO LOOKED DIFFERENTLY.

1057
01:06:28,290 --> 01:06:30,741
EVEN A FRIENDLY FACE.

1058
01:06:32,809 --> 01:06:34,596
I HAD REACHED A LOW POINT.

1059
01:06:34,596 --> 01:06:39,494
ALSO THAT FRANKENSTEIN I THOUGHT
FELL ASLEEP ACTUALLY HAD DIED.

1060
01:06:39,494 --> 01:06:41,970
BUT THEN, FINALLY, ONE MAN

1061
01:06:41,970 --> 01:06:44,868
WALKED INTO
THAT THEATER WITHOUT JUDGMENT.

1062
01:06:44,868 --> 01:06:47,186
>> HEY, WHAT'S UP.

1063
01:06:48,646 --> 01:06:49,685
HUNGRY?

1064
01:06:49,685 --> 01:06:54,194
>> THIS MAN HAD NO REACTION AT
ALL TO BEING IN A THEATER FULL
OF FRANKENSTEINS,

1065
01:06:54,194 --> 01:06:58,033
NOT BEFORE,
DURING OR AFTER THE MOVIE.

1066
01:06:58,597 --> 01:06:59,966
>> I HAD TO TALK TO HIM.

1067
01:06:59,966 --> 01:07:01,018
EXCUSE ME,

1068
01:07:01,018 --> 01:07:02,848
WHY DIDN'T YOU JUDGE
THE FRANKENSTEINS.

1069
01:07:02,848 --> 01:07:04,114
>> WHO IS FRANKENSTEIN?

1070
01:07:04,114 --> 01:07:07,256
>> YOU'VE NEVER HEARD OF
FRANKENSTEIN?

1071
01:07:07,256 --> 01:07:09,157
>> I KNOW A TOM FRANKENBURG.

1072
01:07:09,157 --> 01:07:11,440
>> MARY SHELLEY'S FRANKENSTEIN?

1073
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:14,245
>> I LOVE MARY SHELLEY.
- HOW

1074
01:07:14,245 --> 01:07:15,412
>> I TOOK GOTHIC LITERATURE.

1075
01:07:15,412 --> 01:07:18,655
>> AND YOU HAVEN'T HEARD OF
FRANKENSTEIN?

1076
01:07:18,655 --> 01:07:20,086
>> DOESN'T RING A BELL.

1077
01:07:20,086 --> 01:07:22,519
>> EVERYONE WAS GREEN.
>> LIKE SHREK.

1078
01:07:22,519 --> 01:07:23,930
>> FRANKENSTEIN.

1079
01:07:23,930 --> 01:07:27,269
TOM FRANKENBURG.
>> YOU ALREADY TOLD ME ABOUT TOM
FRANKENBURG.

1080
01:07:27,269 --> 01:07:29,867
I HAD NEVER BEEN SO CONFUSED

1081
01:07:29,867 --> 01:07:33,448
BUT LATER REFLECTING ON THE MEANING
OF LIFE,

1082
01:07:33,448 --> 01:07:37,954
I REALIZED THE ONLY WAY TO TRULY
RID THE WORLD OF JUDGMENT

1083
01:07:37,954 --> 01:07:40,353
WAS
THROUGH THE POWER OF SONG.

1084
01:07:40,531 --> 01:07:44,566
¶ WE ARE FRANKENSTEINS

1085
01:07:44,566 --> 01:07:48,222
NO NEED TO JUDGE US ¶

1086
01:07:48,222 --> 01:07:51,899
¶ WE ARE THE ONES MADE OUT OF
DEAD PEOPLE

1087
01:07:51,899 --> 01:07:53,976
AND ¶
¶ CAME TO LIFE ¶

1088
01:07:53,976 --> 01:07:55,954
WRITTEN

1089
01:08:08,724 --> 01:08:11,472
SHOW

1090
01:08:11,472 --> 01:08:16,134
MUCH TO LORNE, TO THE AMAZING
CAST AND CREW.

1091
01:08:16,134 --> 01:08:19,366
THIS HAS BEEN ONE OF MY BIGGEST
DREAMS.
I'M SO GRATEFUL.

1092
01:08:19,366 --> 01:08:20,502
THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME,

1093
01:08:20,502 --> 01:08:24,023
THANK YOU FOR LAUGHING AND BEING AN
AMAZING AUDIENCE.

1094
01:08:24,023 --> 01:08:26,550
I HOPE YOU HAVE A GREAT NIGHT
TONIGHT.
