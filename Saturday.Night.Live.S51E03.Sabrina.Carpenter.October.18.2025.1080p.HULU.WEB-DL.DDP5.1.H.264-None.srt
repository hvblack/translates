SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO FEEL

725
00:26:46,622 --> 00:26:47,121
INSECURITY OR FOMO

>> ARE WE SURE SHE'S OKAY, IT

744
00:27:32,868 --> 00:27:34,935
LOOKS LIKE SHE HIT HER HEAD

745
00:27:34,937 --> 00:27:36,136
DIRECTLY INTO THAT DUMPSTER.

746

00:27:57,159 --> 00:27:58,926
CONCUSSION, THAT DIDN'T MAKE ANY

759
00:27:58,928 --> 00:27:59,860
SENSE.

760
00:27:59,862 --> 00:28:01,495
>> THAT JUST MEANS YOU DON'T

761
00:28:01,497 --> 00:28:03,664
BELIEVE IN YOURSELF, GIRL.

762
00:28:03,666 --> 00:28:06,166
>> GIRLS, TUNE OUT THE FOMO,

GET READY TO FLY LIKE THE

764
00:28:08,738 --> 00:28:12,172
ORIGINAL ICON AMELIA EARHART.

00:28:12,174 --> 00:28:15,909
SHE BROKE THE GLASS CEILING BY

766
00:28:15,911 --> 00:28:16,610
BEING THE FIRST WOMAN TO EVER

767

DIE AND THAT'S MY PERIOD.

768
00:28:19,014 --> 00:28:22,216

769
00:28:22,218 --> 00:28:23,250
>> NOW, WHO HERE HAS A PROBLEM?

770
00:28:23,252 --> 00:28:28,122

BUT I THINK MY COWORKER SUSAN IS

774
00:28:31,727 --> 00:28:32,326
TRYING TO SABOTAGE ME.

775
00:28:32,328 --> 00:28:32,860
WHAT DO I DO?

776
00:28:32,862 --> 00:28:33,594
>> GIRL, THERE'S A SPECIAL PLACE

777
00:28:33,596 --> 00:28:37,197
IN HELL FOR WOMEN WHO ARE WOMEN.

778
00:28:37,199 --> 00:28:39,733
BUT WHEN YOU'RE IN THE CAR OF

00:28:39,735 --> 00:28:43,203
SUCCESS, THE ONLY THING SUSAN BE

780
00:28:43,205 --> 00:28:43,937

>> WHAT IS YOUR DEAL.

786
00:28:54,650 --> 00:28:57,284
DO YOU JUST HATE OTHER WOMEN?

787
00:28:57,286 --> 00:29:00,187
>> I'M WORRIED SHE HAS A BRAIN

788
00:29:00,189 --> 00:29:00,521
INJURY.

789
00:29:00,523 --> 00:29:00,954
>> ALL RIGHT.

790
00:29:00,956 --> 00:29:01,822
NOW WHO HERE WANTS TO BE RICH?

791
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:02,856
WHO WANTS TO DRIVE A NICE CAR

792
00:29:02,858 --> 00:29:05,025
AND LIVE IN A GAY COMMUNITY?

793
00:29:05,027 --> 00:29:06,160
>> DOES SHE MEAN GATED

794
00:29:06,162 --> 00:29:08,862
COMMUNITY?

795
00:29:08,864 --> 00:29:09,930

798
00:29:14,603 --> 00:29:15,536

COMMUNITY.

800
00:29:16,972 --> 00:29:18,071
>> IF YOU WANT TO DO THAT, YOU

801
00:29:18,073 --> 00:29:26,280
HAVE TO REPLACE YOUR FOMO WITH

802

FOMO-OMO-NONONO.

WHAT DOES THAT STAND FOR?

804
00:29:27,983 --> 00:29:29,216
I'LL TELL YOU.

805
00:29:29,218 --> 00:29:29,817
IT STANDS FOR

806
00:29:29,819 --> 00:29:30,751
FEAR OF MISSING OUT ON ME OR NOT

807
00:29:30,753 --> 00:29:31,852
ON OTHER PEOPLE'S EXPECTATIONS

808
00:29:31,854 --> 00:29:32,953
OF ME WHILE I'M ON THE WAY TO

809
00:29:32,955 --> 00:29:33,687
LIVING MY DREAM LIFE IN THE CAR

810
00:29:33,689 --> 00:29:34,555
OF SUCCESS.

811
00:29:34,557 --> 00:29:36,690
YEAH, THAT'S WHAT IT STANDS FOR.

00:29:36,692 --> 00:29:39,927
AND YOU JUST GOT YOUR PERIOD.

813
00:29:39,929 --> 00:29:43,130
>> WAIT, SO THAT WAS PLANNED?

814
00:29:43,132 --> 00:29:44,865
STOP, DANCING, YOU'RE GOING TO

815
00:29:44,867 --> 00:29:48,235
HURT HER AGAIN.

816
00:29:48,237 --> 00:29:50,771
>> AH, ANOTHER WINDOW

00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:52,072
SUPPOSE I'LL JUST BE ON MY WAY.

819
00:29:52,074 --> 00:29:56,910
WHOA!

820

THAT WAS A RELIEF, MY

821
00:29:58,814 --> 00:29:59,813
WINDOW IS SAFE.

822
00:29:59,815 --> 00:30:00,914
NO!

823
00:30:00,916 --> 00:30:03,684
AH!

824
00:30:03,686 --> 00:30:08,789
WHAT?

825
00:30:08,791 --> 00:30:10,958
WHAT WAS THAT?

826
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,526
>> QUEEN LISHA, MY GIRL, WE GOT

827
00:30:12,528 --> 00:30:14,728
TO GET YOU TO THE HOSPITAL.

828
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:17,431
YOU CLEARLY HAVE A CONCUSSION.

829
00:30:17,433 --> 00:30:21,768
>> DO I?

830
00:30:21,770 --> 00:30:25,038
OR IS YOUR INTERNALIZED MISOGYNY

831
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:27,774
SO DEEP ROOTED THAT A WOMAN

832
00:30:27,776 --> 00:30:28,876
BEING CONFIDENT AND INSPIRING

833
00:30:28,878 --> 00:30:32,412
JUST SOUNDS LIKE NONSENSE TO

834
00:30:32,414 --> 00:30:32,679
YOU?

835
00:30:32,681 --> 00:30:34,081
>> YOU KNOW WHAT, MAYBE YOU'RE

836
00:30:34,083 --> 00:30:35,148
RIGHT.

837
00:30:35,150 --> 00:30:41,121
THANKS QUEEN LISHA.

THE CHAT WAS NAMED JOST FAMILY.

1067

PRESIDENT TRUMP TOLD REPORTERS,

1072
00:40:03,251 --> 00:40:03,983
I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANYTHING

00:40:03,985 --> 00:40:04,851
THAT'S GOING TO GET ME INTO

1074
00:40:04,853 --> 00:40:05,385
HEAVEN.

1075
00:40:05,387 --> 00:40:06,519
THEN HE PAUSED FOR TEN FULL

1076
00:40:06,521 --> 00:40:08,121
MINUTES WAITING FOR SOMEONE TO

1077
00:40:08,123 --> 00:40:11,925
SAY THAT'S NOT TRUE.

1078
00:40:11,927 --> 00:40:14,394
BECAUSE TRUMP CAN'T GO TO

1079
00:40:14,396 --> 00:40:17,297
HEAVEN, HE'S FAR TOO BUSY DOWN

WITHOUT WARNING.

1086
00:40:26,374 --> 00:40:27,474
YOU MAY NOT THINK THAT'S A BIG

1087
00:40:27,476 --> 00:40:28,575
DEAL RIGHT NOW, BUT ONE DAY SOON

1088
00:40:28,577 --> 00:40:29,642
YOU'LL LOOK AT YOURSELF IN THE

1089
00:40:29,644 --> 00:40:30,743
MIRROR AND REALIZE -- YOU'RE OUT

1091
00:40:43,124 --> 00:40:43,756
PRESIDENT TRUMP CRITICIZED

AND I GOT TO AGREE.

1097
00:40:51,333 --> 00:41:01,608
THAT THING DO LOOK WAXED.

1098
00:41:01,610 --> 00:41:03,142

AT LEAST THAT'S WHAT MY

1107
00:41:15,857 --> 00:41:18,391
THERAPIST TOLD ME.

1108

00:49:37,091 --> 00:49:39,825
I LOOK LIKE A GUY WHO WAS REALLY

1352
00:49:39,827 --> 00:49:46,098
GOOD AT FOOTBALL PREINTEGRATION.

1353
00:49:46,100 --> 00:49:48,567
I WILL SAY I THINK THE WAY I

1354
00:49:48,569 --> 00:49:49,268
GREW UP HAS REALLY HELPED ME

1355
00:49:49,270 --> 00:49:50,136
ADJUST TO NEW YORK.

1356
00:49:50,138 --> 00:49:51,237
EVERYONE SAYS PUBLIC TRANSIT IS

1357
00:49:51,239 --> 00:49:53,973
WILD.

1358
00:49:53,975 --> 00:49:55,007
FOR MY ENTIRE CHILDHOOD THE TEN

1359
00:49:55,009 --> 00:50:00,980

1360
00:50:00,982 --> 00:50:05,217
CHEVY ASTRO VAN.

1361
00:50:05,219 --> 00:50:05,951
SO ANYWHERE WE DROVE IT LOOKED

1362
00:50:05,953 --> 00:50:09,989
LIKE WE WERE BEING TRAFFICKED.

1363
00:50:09,991 --> 00:50:10,556
I CAN HANG.

1364
00:50:10,558 --> 00:50:11,657
WATCHING PEOPLE JUMP OVER THE

1365
00:50:11,659 --> 00:50:12,391
TURNSTILES, AND TODAY I WORKED

1366
00:50:12,393 --> 00:50:13,259
UP THE COURAGE AND JUMPED OVER

1367
00:50:13,261 --> 00:50:17,096
MY FIRST ONE.

1368
00:50:17,098 --> 00:50:17,963
>> CONGRATS,

1369
00:50:17,965 --> 00:50:18,597

1371
00:50:20,401 --> 00:50:21,634
>> IT WAS COOL, IT WAS

1372
00:50:21,636 --> 00:50:23,169
EXHILARATING AND THRILLING.

1373
00:50:23,171 --> 00:50:27,473
IT WAS ON THE WAY OUT BUT I

1374
00:50:27,475 --> 00:50:29,008
-- IT FELT GOOD, IT COUNTS.

1375
00:50:29,010 --> 00:50:29,942
>> IT STILL COUNTS.

1376
00:50:29,944 --> 00:50:33,512
YOU'RE A GOOD BOY.

1377
00:50:33,514 --> 00:50:35,648
>> SURE.

1378
00:50:35,650 --> 00:50:36,082
YEAH.

1379

I'M A GOOD BOY.

1380
00:50:39,987 --> 00:50:43,355
I'M JUST REALLY SCARED OF BEING

1381
00:50:43,357 --> 00:50:45,591
IN TROUBLE ALL THE TIME BECAUSE

1382
00:50:45,593 --> 00:50:47,726
I GREW UP CATHOLIC.

1383
00:50:47,728 --> 00:50:50,262
I GREW UP FEELING GUILTY BUT

1384
00:50:50,264 --> 00:50:53,732
NEVER KNEW WHAT FOR.

1385
00:50:53,734 --> 00:50:56,402
IF YOU GREW UP CATHOLIC, ONLY

1386
00:50:56,404 --> 00:50:59,205
SINS YOU KNOW ARE LIKE BREAKING

1387
00:50:59,207 --> 00:50:59,538

OR WHATEVER.

1391
00:51:01,375 --> 00:51:02,408
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY IN

1392
00:51:02,410 --> 00:51:05,845
CONFESSION.

1393
00:51:05,847 --> 00:51:07,947
COULDN'T CONFESS TO THE ONE SIN

1394
00:51:07,949 --> 00:51:10,316

01:02:39,223 --> 01:02:41,389
WHAT A FAMILIAR FEELING ¶

1685
01:02:41,391 --> 01:02:43,058
¶ ALL MY FRIENDS IN LOVE

1686
01:02:43,060 --> 01:02:44,693
AND I'M THE ONE THEY CALL

1687
01:02:44,695 --> 01:02:46,294
FOR A THIRD WHEELING ¶

1688
01:02:46,296 --> 01:02:47,362
¶ PROBABLY SHOULD

1689
01:02:47,364 --> 01:02:48,997
HAVE GUESSED

1690
01:02:48,999 --> 01:02:50,632
HE'S LIKE THE REST

1691
01:02:50,634 --> 01:02:52,801
SO FINE AND SO DECEIVING ¶

1692
01:02:52,803 --> 01:02:54,436
¶ THERE'S NOBODY'S SON

1693
01:02:54,438 --> 01:02:57,138
NOT ANYONE LEFT FOR ME

1694
01:02:57,140 --> 01:02:59,841
TO BELIEVE IN

1695
01:02:59,843 --> 01:03:13,455
BELIEVE IN, OH WHOA WHOA ¶

1696
01:03:13,457 --> 01:03:15,624
¶ THAT BOY IS CORRUPT AH

1697
01:03:15,626 --> 01:03:16,658
COULD YOU RAISE HIM

1698
01:03:16,660 --> 01:03:19,961
TO LOVE ME MAYBE ¶

1699
01:03:19,963 --> 01:03:21,596
¶ HE SURE EFFED ME UP AH-AH

1700
01:03:21,598 --> 01:03:22,664
AND YES I'M TALKING 'BOUT

1701
01:03:22,666 --> 01:03:25,367
YOUR BABY ¶

1702
01:03:25,369 --> 01:03:27,035
¶ THAT BOY IS CORRUPT AH

1703
01:03:27,037 --> 01:03:29,204
GET PTSD ON THE DAILY ¶

1704
01:03:29,206 --> 01:03:30,839
¶ HE SURE EFFED ME UP AH-AH

1705
01:03:30,841 --> 01:03:32,440
AND YES I'M TALKING 'BOUT

1706
01:03:32,442 --> 01:03:34,609
YOUR BABY ¶

1707
01:03:34,611 --> 01:03:36,244
¶ HERE WE GO AGAIN

1708
01:03:36,246 --> 01:03:38,446
CRYING IN BED

1709
01:03:38,448 --> 01:03:40,649
WHAT A FAMILIAR FEELING ¶

1710
01:03:40,651 --> 01:03:42,250
¶ ALL MY FRIENDS IN LOVE

1711
01:03:42,252 --> 01:03:48,256
AND I'M THE ONE THEY CALL

1712
01:03:48,258 --> 01:03:49,324
¶ PROBABLY SHOULD

1713
01:03:49,326 --> 01:03:50,392
HAVE GUESSED

1714
01:03:50,394 --> 01:03:51,493
HE'S LIKE THE REST

1715
01:03:51,495 --> 01:03:52,594
SO FINE AND SO DECEIVING ¶

1716
01:03:52,596 --> 01:03:53,695
¶ THERE'S NOBODY'S SON

1717
01:03:53,697 --> 01:03:56,932
NOT ANYONE LEFT FOR ME

1718
01:03:56,934 --> 01:04:02,570
TO BELIEVE IN ¶

1719
01:04:25,294 --> 01:04:28,229
BUT GROWING UP I WAS ALWAYS TOLD

1720
01:04:28,231 --> 01:04:29,864
TO NEVER JUDGE A BOOK BY ITS

1721
01:04:29,866 --> 01:04:32,033
COVER.

1722
01:04:32,035 --> 01:04:33,134
BUT WHEN I WATCHED THE NEWS, I

1723
01:04:33,136 --> 01:04:34,235
FEEL LIKE NOBODY ELSE REMEMBERS

1724
01:04:34,237 --> 01:04:42,143
THAT LESSON.

1725
01:04:42,145 --> 01:04:44,746
>> LABUBU?

1726
01:04:44,748 --> 01:04:45,180
>> NO TEETH.

1727
01:04:45,182 --> 01:04:47,649
>> YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT TEETH.

1728
01:04:47,651 --> 01:04:50,585
>> SO I WANTED TO PUT THAT TO

1729
01:04:50,587 --> 01:04:51,519
THE TEST TONIGHT WITH A LITTLE

1730
01:04:51,521 --> 01:04:52,487
SOCIAL EXPERIMENT.

1731
01:04:52,489 --> 01:04:53,088
I FILLED A THEATER WITH

1732
01:04:53,090 --> 01:04:54,089
PROFESSIONAL ACTORS DRESSED TO

1733
01:04:54,091 --> 01:04:54,823
LOOK STEREOTYPICALLY DANGEROUS

1734
01:04:54,825 --> 01:04:55,724
OR SCARY.

1735
01:04:55,726 --> 01:04:56,791
NOT THE TYPE ONE MIGHT EXPECT TO

1736
01:04:56,793 --> 01:04:58,460
ENCOUNTER IN AN UPSCALE

1737
01:04:58,462 --> 01:04:59,527
NEIGHBORHOOD.

1738
01:04:59,529 --> 01:05:00,261
I WANTED TO SEE IF PEOPLE WOULD

1739
01:05:00,263 --> 01:05:02,197
JUDGE THEM BASED ON THEIR

1740
01:05:02,199 --> 01:05:03,298
APPEARANCE.

1741
01:05:03,300 --> 01:05:03,932
AND WHAT I FOUND FRANKLY

1742
01:05:03,934 --> 01:05:04,966
DISAPPOINTED ME.

1743
01:05:04,968 --> 01:05:06,034
OKAY.

1744
01:05:06,036 --> 01:05:07,669
FIRST GUY IS GOING IN.

1745
01:05:07,671 --> 01:05:23,852
¶¶

1746
01:05:27,323 --> 01:05:35,363
THEIR APPEARANCES.

1747
01:05:35,365 --> 01:05:36,398
EVEN THIS LADY, WHO I THOUGHT

1748
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:38,099
WOULD BE WOKE BECAUSE OF THE

1749
01:05:38,101 --> 01:05:40,769
HAIRCUT.

1750
01:05:40,771 --> 01:05:41,870
MISS, MISS, WHY DID YOU LEAVE

1751
01:05:41,872 --> 01:05:43,471
THAT MOVIE THEATER?

1752
01:05:43,473 --> 01:05:44,572
>> BECAUSE EVERYONE WAS DRESSED

1753
01:05:44,574 --> 01:05:46,207
AS FRANKENSTEIN, AND THE MOVIE I

1754
01:05:46,209 --> 01:05:47,275
WANTED TO SEE DOES NOT HAVE

1755
01:05:47,277 --> 01:05:50,779
FRANKENSTEIN IN IT.

1756
01:05:50,781 --> 01:05:52,580
>> WOW, SO YOU ASSUMED THEY WERE

1757
01:05:52,582 --> 01:05:53,815
THERE TO SEE A MOVIE ABOUT

1758
01:05:53,817 --> 01:05:54,849
FRANKENSTEIN JUST BECAUSE OF THE

1759
01:05:54,851 --> 01:05:55,884
COLOR OF THEIR SKIN?

1760
01:05:55,886 --> 01:05:56,618
>> THE COLOR OF THEIR SKIN WAS

1761
01:05:56,620 --> 01:05:59,721
GREEN.

1762
01:05:59,723 --> 01:06:01,956
>> SHE JUST SAID THE QUIET PART

1763
01:06:01,958 --> 01:06:03,758
OUT LOUD.

1764
01:06:03,760 --> 01:06:05,393
IF YOU WALKED INTO THE THEATER

1765
01:06:05,395 --> 01:06:08,363
TO SEE THE FANTASTIC 4 AND THE

1766
01:06:08,365 --> 01:06:10,999
WHOLE AUDIENCE WAS ASIAN, WHAT

1767
01:06:11,001 --> 01:06:11,566
WOULD YOU ASSUME THEN?

1768
01:06:11,568 --> 01:06:12,200
>> WHAT WOULD YOU ASSUME?

1769
01:06:12,202 --> 01:06:14,836
>> UM.

1770
01:06:14,838 --> 01:06:15,904
>> SLIGHTLY PROBLEMATIC.

1771
01:06:15,906 --> 01:06:17,005
>> EVERYONE WAS FAILING MY TEST

1772
01:06:17,007 --> 01:06:18,640
AND BEFORE LONG MY FRANKENSTEINS

1773
01:06:18,642 --> 01:06:19,707
WERE STARTING TO LOSE FAITH.

1774
01:06:19,709 --> 01:06:20,775
EVEN MY OWN GIRLFRIEND FAILED

1775
01:06:20,777 --> 01:06:21,876
WHEN I PERFORMED THE SAME

1776
01:06:21,878 --> 01:06:25,146
EXPERIMENT IN HER APARTMENT.

1777
01:06:25,148 --> 01:06:29,517
>> WE BROKE UP THREE MONTHS AGO.

1778
01:06:29,519 --> 01:06:30,618
>> AND AS MY EXPERIMENT EVOLVED,

1779
01:06:30,620 --> 01:06:31,653
I FOUND THAT PEOPLE JUDGED

1780
01:06:31,655 --> 01:06:33,321
ANYONE WHO LOOKED DIFFERENTLY.

1781
01:06:33,323 --> 01:06:37,625
EVEN A FRIENDLY FACE.

1782
01:06:37,627 --> 01:06:39,828
I HAD REACHED A LOW POINT.

1783
01:06:39,830 --> 01:06:41,429
ALSO THAT FRANKENSTEIN I THOUGHT

1784
01:06:41,431 --> 01:06:45,967
FELL ASLEEP ACTUALLY HAD DIED.

1785
01:06:45,969 --> 01:06:47,435
BUT THEN, FINALLY, ONE MAN

1786
01:06:47,437 --> 01:06:47,836
WALKED INTO

1787
01:06:47,838 --> 01:06:49,571
THAT THEATER WITHOUT JUDGMENT.

1788
01:06:49,573 --> 01:06:53,374
>> HEY, WHAT'S UP.

1789
01:06:53,376 --> 01:06:55,009
HUNGRY?

1790
01:06:55,011 --> 01:06:56,611
>> THIS MAN HAD NO REACTION AT

1791
01:06:56,613 --> 01:06:58,213
ALL TO BEING IN A THEATER FULL

1792
01:06:58,215 --> 01:06:59,881
OF FRANKENSTEINS, NOT BEFORE,

1793
01:06:59,883 --> 01:07:02,684
DURING OR AFTER THE MOVIE.

1794
01:07:02,686 --> 01:07:03,685
>> REALLY?

1795
01:07:03,687 --> 01:07:05,353
>> I HAD TO TALK TO HIM.

1796
01:07:05,355 --> 01:07:08,490
EXCUSE ME, WHY DIDN'T YOU JUDGE

1797
01:07:08,492 --> 01:07:10,525
THE FRANKENSTEINS.

1798
01:07:10,527 --> 01:07:11,659
>> WHO IS FRANKENSTEIN?

1799
01:07:11,661 --> 01:07:12,293
>> YOU'VE NEVER HEARD OF

1800
01:07:12,295 --> 01:07:13,128
FRANKENSTEIN?

1801
01:07:13,130 --> 01:07:16,731
>> I KNOW A TOM FRANKENBURG.

1802
01:07:16,733 --> 01:07:21,102
>> MARY SHELLEY'S FRANKENSTEIN?

1803
01:07:21,104 --> 01:07:22,103
>> I LOVE MARY SHELLEY.

1804
01:07:22,105 --> 01:07:24,973
>> I TOOK GOTHIC LITERATURE.

1805
01:07:24,975 --> 01:07:26,207
>> AND YOU HAVEN'T HEARD OF

1806
01:07:26,209 --> 01:07:26,641
FRANKENSTEIN?

1807
01:07:26,643 --> 01:07:27,809
>> DOESN'T RING A BELL.

1808
01:07:27,811 --> 01:07:28,376
>> EVERYONE WAS GREEN.

1809
01:07:28,378 --> 01:07:31,112
>> LIKE SHREK.

1810
01:07:31,114 --> 01:07:36,151
>> FRANKENSTEIN.

1811
01:07:36,153 --> 01:07:36,618
TOM FRANKENBURG.

1812
01:07:36,620 --> 01:07:37,352
>> YOU ALREADY TOLD ME ABOUT TOM

1813
01:07:37,354 --> 01:07:39,287
FRANKENBURG.

1814
01:07:39,289 --> 01:07:42,223
I HAD NEVER BEEN SO CONFUSED BUT

1815
01:07:42,225 --> 01:07:43,958
LATER REFLECTING ON THE MEANING

1816
01:07:43,960 --> 01:07:44,292
OF LIFE,

1817
01:07:44,294 --> 01:07:45,026
I REALIZED THE ONLY WAY TO TRULY

1818
01:07:45,028 --> 01:07:45,727
RID THE WORLD OF JUDGMENT WAS

1819
01:07:45,729 --> 01:07:47,695
THROUGH THE POWER OF SONG.

1820
01:07:47,697 --> 01:07:50,431
¶ WE ARE FRANKENSTEINS NO NEED

1821
01:07:50,433 --> 01:07:54,135
TO JUDGE US ¶

1822
01:07:54,137 --> 01:07:55,803
¶ WE ARE THE ONES MADE OUT OF

1823
01:07:55,805 --> 01:07:56,838
DEAD PEOPLE AND ¶

1824
01:07:56,840 --> 01:08:01,776
¶ CAME TO LIFE ¶

1825
01:08:16,025 --> 01:08:21,696
MUCH TO LORNE, TO THE AMAZING

1826
01:08:21,698 --> 01:08:23,631
CAST AND CREW.

1827
01:08:23,633 --> 01:08:26,334
THIS HAS BEEN ONE OF MY BIGGEST

1828
01:08:26,336 --> 01:08:26,668
DREAMS.

1829
01:08:26,670 --> 01:08:29,204
I'M SO GRATEFUL.

1830
01:08:29,206 --> 01:08:31,005
THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME, THANK

1831
01:08:31,007 --> 01:08:34,309

1832
01:08:34,311 --> 01:08:34,809
AMAZING AUDIENCE.

1833
01:08:34,811 --> 01:08:35,543
I HOPE YOU HAVE A GREAT NIGHT

1834
01:08:35,545 --> 01:08:39,214
TONIGHT.
