1
00:00:01,389 --> 00:00:05,422
>>> THIS IS AN MSNBC NEWS
SPECIAL REPORT.

2
00:00:10,311 --> 00:00:12,168
>>> GOOD EVENING,

3
00:00:12,168 --> 00:00:15,875
I AM NICOLLE WALLACE AND YOU'RE
WATCHING MSNBC NEWS

4
00:00:15,875 --> 00:00:18,307
BECAUSE YOU
HAVE NOWHERE ELSE TO PLACE YOUR
ANGER.

5
00:00:18,307 --> 00:00:23,201
TONIGHT POLITICAL FALLOUT FROM
THE RECENT JANUARY 6th SUBPOENAS,

6
00:00:23,201 --> 00:00:26,262
UPDATES ON THE
RUSSIAN HELICOPTER TAKEN DOWN BY UKRAINE

7
00:00:26,262 --> 00:00:29,138
PLUS A NATIONWIDE
SHORTAGE OF BABY FORMULA.

8
00:00:29,138 --> 00:00:33,961
BUT WE START OF COURSE WITH THE
JOHNNY DEPP AMBER HEARD CUCKOO
TRIAL.

9
00:00:34,305 --> 00:00:37,641
I KNOW IT'S NOT THE MOST
PERTINENT STORY OF THE MOMENT,

10
00:00:37,641 --> 00:00:40,777
BUT WITH ALL OF THE PROBLEMS IN
THE WORLD ISN'T IT NICE TO HAVE A NEWS STORY

11
00:00:40,777 --> 00:00:45,609
WE CAN ALL
COLLECTIVELY WATCH AND SAY I'M
GLAD IT AIN'T ME?

12
00:00:45,609 --> 00:00:49,338
I THOUGHT SO.
WE TAKE YOU NOW TO LIVE
COVERAGE.

13
00:00:49,338 --> 00:00:53,005
>> MR. DEPP, EARLIER
IN THIS TRIAL YOU MENTIONED

14
00:00:53,005 --> 00:00:56,740
THAT
MISS HEARD LEFT FECAL MATTER IN
YOUR BED.

15
00:00:56,740 --> 00:01:00,356
>> THAT IS CORRECT, YES.

16
00:01:00,356 --> 00:01:03,194
>> AND HOW DID THAT MAKE YOU
FEEL?

17
00:01:03,194 --> 00:01:06,684
>> I FELT VERY, VERY --

18
00:01:07,193 --> 00:01:09,141
SAD.

19
00:01:09,141 --> 00:01:11,853
>> OBJECTION.
YOUR HONOR, WE'VE BEEN THROUGH THIS,

20
00:01:11,853 --> 00:01:14,389
THERE'S NO ACTUAL PROOF
THIS EVER HAPPENED.

21
00:01:14,389 --> 00:01:17,454
>> SUSTAINED.
WHERE ARE YOU GOING WITH THIS
COUNSELOR?

22
00:01:17,454 --> 00:01:22,068
>> YOUR HONOR, WE'VE RECENTLY
FOUND SURVEILLANCE FOOTAGE OF THE HOUSE STAFF

23
00:01:22,068 --> 00:01:25,893
DISCOVERING THE
ALLEGED FECAL MATTER ON MR.
DEPP'S BED.

24
00:01:25,893 --> 00:01:27,703
>> OH.
WORD?

25
00:01:27,703 --> 00:01:32,014
>> OBJECTION.
THAT STILL WOULDN'T PROVE MY
CLIENT IS GUILTY OF ANYTHING.

26
00:01:32,014 --> 00:01:34,543
>> THAT'S TRUE. BUT I'LL ALLOW IT

27
00:01:34,543 --> 00:01:39,188
BECAUSE IT
DOES SOUND FUN AND THIS TRIAL IS
FOR FUN.

28
00:01:39,188 --> 00:01:41,294
>> WHAT?

29
00:01:41,575 --> 00:01:44,006
>> THANK YOU, YOUR HONOR.

30
00:01:44,006 --> 00:01:48,309
MR. DEPP, CAN YOU TELL US WHO
THAT IS?

31
00:01:48,309 --> 00:01:51,327
>> WELL, THAT'S MY PROPERTY
MANAGER, LEONARD GREEN.

32
00:01:51,327 --> 00:01:55,144
I GUESS HE'S DOING A ROUTINE
CHECK AROUND THE HOUSE.

33
00:01:55,144 --> 00:01:58,885
>> YOU KNOW SHE CUT THAT JOKER'S
FINGER OFF, RIGHT?

34
00:01:58,885 --> 00:02:01,211
IF I'M LYING I'M FLYING.

35
00:02:01,211 --> 00:02:03,148
HOLD ON A SECOND.

36
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:10,079
DAMN, SMELL LIKE BOO BOO IN
HERE.

37
00:02:10,079 --> 00:02:12,944
IT'S COMING FROM THIS BED.

38
00:02:12,944 --> 00:02:17,652
AH, HELL NO!
THAT'S A BOOBOO!

39
00:02:18,262 --> 00:02:22,736
>> AND THERE YOU HAVE IT.
THEY FOUND THE DOOKIE.

40
00:02:22,736 --> 00:02:26,848
>> OBJECTION.
YOUR HONOR, THIS IS PURE
SPECULATION.

41
00:02:26,848 --> 00:02:30,603
>> OVERRULED.
I'D LIKE TO SEE MORE OF THIS
VIDEO?

42
00:02:30,603 --> 00:02:34,398
>> WHY?
>> BECAUSE IT'S FUNNY.

43
00:02:34,398 --> 00:02:36,165
>> PLEASE CONTINUE.

44
00:02:36,165 --> 00:02:39,688
>> SASHA!
DAMN, I HATE THIS JOB.

45
00:02:39,688 --> 00:02:42,088
>> WHY YOU YELLING MY NAME LIKE
YOU CRAZY?

46
00:02:42,088 --> 00:02:43,400
>> LOOK AT THIS.

47
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:46,983
>> AH, HELL NAH.
WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST GO IN THE
TOILET?

48
00:02:46,983 --> 00:02:48,924
>> I DIDN'T DO THIS.

49
00:02:48,924 --> 00:02:52,256
>> WHO DID IT, THEN?
>> I DON'T KNOW.
MAYBE THE DOG?

50
00:02:52,256 --> 00:02:54,712
>> NO, NO, NO, NO.
THAT MESS AIN'T COME OUT OF NO
DOG.

51
00:02:54,712 --> 00:02:57,611
THAT CAME OUT OF A DEHYDRATED
ADULT.

52
00:02:57,611 --> 00:03:01,189
>> MAYBE THE WIFE DID IT.
>> WHY WOULD SHE BOOBOO IN HER
OWN BED?

53
00:03:01,189 --> 00:03:03,418
>>  YOU REMEMBER
SHE ALREADY CUT THAT BOY FINGER
OFF.

54
00:03:03,418 --> 00:03:08,652
AND MY DADDY ALWAYS TOLD ME, IF
A GIRL CUT YOUR FINGER OFF
SHE'LL BOO BOO IN YOUR BED.

55
00:03:09,814 --> 00:03:14,087
>> WHY YOU TAKING A PICTURE OF
IT?
>> BECAUSE IT LOOKS JUST LIKE
THE EMOJI.

56
00:03:14,087 --> 00:03:16,873
>> MAN, WHAT IS WRONG WITH WHITE
PEOPLE?

57
00:03:16,873 --> 00:03:19,750
>> I DON'T KNOW BUT YOU NEED IT
CLEAN THIS UP BEFORE MR. JOHNNY
GET BACK.

58
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:22,381
>> NO, NO, NO.
THAT AIN'T MY JOB.
I AM A LANDSCAPER.

59
00:03:22,381 --> 00:03:24,263
>> WELL, AIN'T THAT FERTILIZER?

60
00:03:24,263 --> 00:03:26,399
>> SOFIA!
>> SOFIA!

61
00:03:26,399 --> 00:03:30,469
>> OBJECTION, YOUR HONOR.
HOW MUCH OF THIS VIDEO DO WE
HAVE TO WATCH?

62
00:03:30,469 --> 00:03:32,443
>> WE DON'T HAVE TO WATCH ANY OF
IT.

63
00:03:32,443 --> 00:03:35,147
BUT WE WANT TO.
SO HUSH.

64
00:03:35,147 --> 00:03:37,575
NOW, WHO'S THIS SOFIA PERSON?

65
00:03:37,575 --> 00:03:41,614
>> OH, SHE'S MY --
CLEANING LADY.

66
00:03:41,614 --> 00:03:45,714
>> MR. DEPP, ARE YOU FINDING
THIS TRIAL AMUSING?

67
00:03:45,714 --> 00:03:48,902
>> A LITTLE.
YES.

68
00:03:48,902 --> 00:03:53,169
>> SO AM I.
YOU'RE BAD, CAPTAIN JACK.

69
00:03:59,758 --> 00:04:02,064
>> IT'S BOOBOO, SOFIA.

70
00:04:03,907 --> 00:04:06,108
>> SEE, I TOLD YOU.

71
00:04:06,108 --> 00:04:08,115
>> SOFIA, YOU GOT TO CLEAN THAT
UP, OKAY.

72
00:04:08,115 --> 00:04:11,712
>> NO, NO NO, NO.
>> YES, YES, YES, YES, YES, YES.

73
00:04:11,712 --> 00:04:15,459
>> MAN, YA'LL SEEN SOMEBODY DREW
A DINGALING IN THE WALLS WITH
BLOOD?

74
00:04:15,459 --> 00:04:17,629
I HATE THIS DAMN JOB SO MUCH.

75
00:04:17,629 --> 00:04:19,555
WHAT'S THAT SMELL?

76
00:04:20,434 --> 00:04:23,941
SO YOU REALLY DID IT, MAN.
YOU FINALLY QUITTING.

77
00:04:24,283 --> 00:04:27,068
>> I DIDN'T DO THIS.
IT WAS THE WIFE.

78
00:04:27,068 --> 00:04:30,272
>> AND YOU'VE GOT TO CLEAN IT
UP, JAMAL.
>> OH, HELL NO, I JUST DO
LAUNDRY.

79
00:04:30,272 --> 00:04:32,253
>> YEAH.
AND THAT'S LAUNDRY, BRO.

80
00:04:32,253 --> 00:04:34,543
>> DAMN, I HATE THIS JOB.

81
00:04:34,543 --> 00:04:37,954
>> OKAY.
I THINK I'VE SEEN ENOUGH.

82
00:04:37,954 --> 00:04:40,509
THIS TRIAL HAS GIVEN ME A LOT TO
CONSIDER.

83
00:04:40,509 --> 00:04:43,515
ON ONE HAND I BELIEVE MR. DEPP'S STORY,

84
00:04:43,515 --> 00:04:47,250
BUT ON THE OTHER HAND
YOUR CONSTANT LITTLE SMIRK LETS ME KNOW

85
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:51,465
THAT THIS IS NOT THE
FIRST WOMAN YOU'VE MADE SO MAD
THAT SHE POOPED IN YOUR BED.

86
00:04:51,465 --> 00:04:55,382
>> I GUESS I HAVE BEEN KNOWN TO
BE A --

87
00:04:55,382 --> 00:04:56,995
FULL NIGHTMARE.

88
00:04:56,995 --> 00:05:01,530
>> RIGHT.
OKAY.
EITHER WAY, I'M JUST SO GLAD
THIS AIN'T ME.

89
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:06,957
AND --
LIVE FROM NEW YORK, IT'S
SATURDAY NIGHT!

90
00:07:17,438 --> 00:07:22,282
>> Announcer: LADIES AND
GENTLEMEN, SELENA GOMEZ!

91
00:07:37,814 --> 00:07:40,609
>>> THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.

92
00:07:40,609 --> 00:07:42,743
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

93
00:07:42,743 --> 00:07:45,372
I'M SO EXCITED TO BE HERE.

94
00:07:45,372 --> 00:07:48,948
GROWING UP, I USED TO WATCH
SNL EVERY SATURDAY WITH MY MOM

95
00:07:48,948 --> 00:07:50,145
-- HI, MOM.

96
00:07:50,145 --> 00:07:51,956
THIS IS A BIG MOMENT FOR ME.

97
00:07:51,956 --> 00:07:54,276
I ACTUALLY STARTED ACTING WHEN I WAS 7,

98
00:07:54,276 --> 00:07:57,457
AND I'VE BEEN LUCKY
ENOUGH TO WORK WITH SOME HOLLYWOOD ICONS,

99
00:07:57,457 --> 00:07:59,562
FROM STEVE MARTIN, MARTIN SHORT,

100
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:02,290
AND OF
COURSE BARNEY.

101
00:08:06,357 --> 00:08:09,737
YEAH.
THAT'S ME.
THAT WAS THE FIRST SHOW I WAS
ON.

102
00:08:09,737 --> 00:08:13,503
AND NOW I'M ON A SHOW CALLED
ONLY MURDERS IN THE BUILDING.

103
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:19,436
I WAS SO HONORED TO WORK WITH
STEVE MARTIN AND MARTIN SHORT,

104
00:08:19,436 --> 00:08:22,782
ESPECIALLY AFTER I GOOGLED THEM
TO FIND OUT WHO THEY WERE.

105
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:26,925
I REMEMBER TELLING MY FRIENDS
THAT I WAS CAST IN A SHOW "ONLY MURDERS"

106
00:08:26,925 --> 00:08:29,713
AND SHE SAID SOUNDS
SEXY.
ANY HOT CO-STARS?

107
00:08:29,713 --> 00:08:31,610
AND I WAS LIKE --

108
00:08:33,290 --> 00:08:37,670
DEPENDS.
DO YOU LOVE THE BANJO?

109
00:08:38,457 --> 00:08:42,336
ALL RIGHT.
IT'S COOL BEING AROUND TWO "SNL"
LEGENDS.

110
00:08:42,336 --> 00:08:46,217
AND WHEN I FOUND OUT I WAS
HOSTING I IMMEDIATELY ASKED FOR
THEIR ADVICE.

111
00:08:46,217 --> 00:08:47,882
STEVE SAID TRUST NO ONE.

112
00:08:47,882 --> 00:08:52,265
AND MARTY SAID I THINK STEVE
MARTIN HAS BEEN USING MY CREDIT
CARD.

113
00:08:52,938 --> 00:08:56,505
I ALSO ASKED ONE OF MY OLDEST
FRIENDS, MILEY CYRUS.

114
00:08:56,505 --> 00:09:01,194
AND SHE SAID JUST BE YOURSELF
AND HAVE FUN.

115
00:09:01,194 --> 00:09:05,560
I WAS LIKE, MILEY, IS THAT JUST
AN EXCUSE FOR ME TO DO AN
IMPRESSION OF YOU ON THE SHOW?

116
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:09,018
AND SHE'S LIKE, "HELL, YEAH, I'M
MILEY CYRUS."

117
00:09:09,018 --> 00:09:13,374
BUT ONE REASON I'M REALLY
EXCITED TO HOST "SNL"

118
00:09:13,374 --> 00:09:16,021
IS BECAUSE
I'M SINGLE.

119
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:23,796
AND I HEARD THAT "SNL" IS A
GREAT PLACE TO FIND ROMANCE.

120
00:09:24,153 --> 00:09:26,491
EMMA STONE MET HER HUSBAND HERE.

121
00:09:26,491 --> 00:09:28,789
SCARLETT JOHANSSON AND
COLIN JOST.

122
00:09:28,789 --> 00:09:32,562
AND PETE AND MACHINE GUN KELLY.

123
00:09:32,562 --> 00:09:36,043
AND SINCE I DON'T REALLY WANT TO TRY THE DATING APPS

124
00:09:36,043 --> 00:09:39,623
I JUST WANT
TO PUT IT OUT IN THE UNIVERSE
THAT I'M MANIFESTING LOVE

125
00:09:39,623 --> 00:09:42,062
AND I
WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT I'M
LOOKING FOR MY SOULMATE.

126
00:09:42,062 --> 00:09:45,008
BUT AT THIS POINT I WILL TAKE
ANYONE.

127
00:09:45,227 --> 00:09:47,337
>> I'LL DO IT.

128
00:09:47,337 --> 00:09:49,024
>> WHAT?

129
00:09:49,024 --> 00:09:53,352
>> BE WITH YOU, LIKE YOU SAID,
I'LL DO IT.

130
00:09:54,436 --> 00:09:57,480
NO.

131
00:09:57,925 --> 00:10:01,251
NO.
NO.

132
00:10:01,251 --> 00:10:03,226
>> BUT YOU JUST SAID YOU'D TAKE
ANYONE.

133
00:10:03,226 --> 00:10:05,850
>> YEAH, BUT I WAS JUST SORT OF
JOKING.

134
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:09,608
I JUST DON'T REALLY THINK THAT'S
GOING TO BE OUR JOURNEY.
I'M SORRY.

135
00:10:09,608 --> 00:10:14,099
AREN'T YOU MARRIED?
>> OH, YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.

136
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:18,657
>> OKAY.
WELL, I STILL BELIEVE THAT I CAN
FIND LOVE AND THE RIGHT PERSON.

137
00:10:18,657 --> 00:10:21,934
>> I'LL DO IT.

138
00:10:21,934 --> 00:10:26,707
>> OH, THIS IS THE NEW CAST
MEMBER, JEFF.

139
00:10:28,394 --> 00:10:34,245
>> IT'S JAMES, BUT I'LL CHANGE
IT TO JEFF IF YOU WANT.

140
00:10:34,245 --> 00:10:38,070
>> WAIT, AREN'T YOU MARRIED
ALSO?
>> OH.
RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT.

141
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:39,886
>> EXCUSE ME.

142
00:10:43,635 --> 00:10:46,499
COME ON, MAN.
YOU'VE GOT TO READ THE ROOM.

143
00:10:46,499 --> 00:10:48,801
IT'S A NO, JEFF.
BYE.

144
00:10:48,801 --> 00:10:51,362
>> THANK YOU, PUNKEY.
>> OF COURSE, BABY.

145
00:10:51,362 --> 00:10:53,747
LISTEN, I'M SO SORRY PEOPLE OUT
HERE HARASSING YOU.

146
00:10:53,747 --> 00:10:57,755
IT'S JUST UNACCEPTABLE GIRL.
YOU JUST OUT HERE TRYING TO DO

BUT GETTING SOMETHING FOR ME

358
00:17:57,444 --> 00:18:02,916
WITHOUT ME BEING THERE IS A LOT

359
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:10,323
FOR HIM TO HANDLE.

360
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:10,323
ESPECIALLY AT HIS AGE.

361
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:10,323
I MIGHT HAVE A BOTTLE OR GLASS

OF WINE.

363
00:18:10,323 --> 00:18:13,326
IT'S 10:00 A.M. BUT IT'S FINE.

364
00:18:10,323 --> 00:18:13,326
YOU CAN CUT THAT OUT, RIGHT?

00:18:22,702 --> 00:18:28,241
BUT WHAT'S THIS?

373
00:18:22,702 --> 00:18:28,241

383
00:18:44,858 --> 00:18:48,261

>> NO, THEY CAN'T SEE PURPLE.

485
00:21:31,324 --> 00:21:33,827
>> THAT'S SAD.

486
00:21:31,324 --> 00:21:33,827
I LOVE PURPLE.

487
00:21:33,827 --> 00:21:39,232
>> YEAH.

488
00:21:33,827 --> 00:21:39,232
>> OH, DO YOU GUYS HAVE "THE CAT

489
00:21:33,827 --> 00:21:39,232
IN THE HAT"?

490
00:21:39,232 --> 00:21:41,501
THAT BOOK IS SO FUNNY.

491
00:21:39,232 --> 00:21:41,501
>> WELL, YES, WE DO HAVE "THE

492

SEE, LOCAL NEWS STORIES USUALLY

506
00:22:00,653 --> 00:22:06,726

SENTENCES TO SET THE SCENE

508

BEFORE TRANSITIONING INTO THE

509
00:22:06,726 --> 00:22:09,462
ACTUAL NEWS STORY.

510
00:22:09,462 --> 00:22:13,233

HE MAKES MUSIC, BUT HE DOESN'T

519
00:22:21,141 --> 00:22:26,079
EVEN SING.

520
00:22:21,141 --> 00:22:26,079
HE JUST RAPS.

521
00:22:21,141 --> 00:22:26,079
>> BIENVENIDOS LITTLE HUBCAP.

522

527
00:22:32,419 --> 00:22:37,257
SO YOU GOT AN ALBUM OUT OR

528
00:22:37,257 --> 00:22:41,227
SOMETHING?

529
00:22:37,257 --> 00:22:41,227
>> YEAH, MY MUSIC IS INSPIRED MY

530
00:22:37,257 --> 00:22:41,227
STRUGGLE.

531
00:22:41,227 --> 00:22:44,431
SEE, MY DAD, HE WASN'T AROUND

532
00:22:41,227 --> 00:22:44,431
MUCH, AND WHEN HE WAS, HE WAS

533
00:22:41,227 --> 00:22:44,431
MAD.

534
00:22:44,431 --> 00:22:48,968
>> YOUR DAD WAS A BAD MAN.

535
00:22:44,431 --> 00:22:48,968
>> MY DAD WAS BATMAN?

536
00:22:48,968 --> 00:22:54,107
>> NO, NOT BATMAN.

537
00:22:48,968 --> 00:22:54,107
YOUR DAD WAS A BAD MAN.

538
00:22:48,968 --> 00:22:54,107
>> YEAH, YOU HAD A BAD DAD.

539
00:22:54,107 --> 00:22:56,109
THAT'S SAD.

540
00:22:54,107 --> 00:22:56,109
BUT THEN YOU TURNED YOUR BAD DAD

541
00:22:54,107 --> 00:22:56,109
INTO RAP.

542
00:22:56,109 --> 00:22:58,978
THAT'S GOOD.

543
00:22:56,109 --> 00:22:58,978
>> YEAH, I DIDN'T CATCH ALL

544
00:22:58,978 --> 00:23:04,417
THAT.

545
00:22:58,978 --> 00:23:04,417
SO, I'M JUST GONNA DO MY SONG

>> WOW.

560
00:23:23,269 --> 00:23:27,073
THAT WAS SAD, BUT IT MADE ME

561
00:23:27,073 --> 00:23:29,409
FEEL GOOD.

562
00:23:27,073 --> 00:23:29,409
>> YEAH.

563
00:23:27,073 --> 00:23:29,409
IT'S CATHARTIC.

564
00:23:29,409 --> 00:23:31,811
>> CATHARTIC?

00:23:33,146 --> 00:23:35,749
>> OKAY.

572
00:23:35,749 --> 00:23:41,721

WELL, I'M HERE IN PICO PARK

583
00:23:47,327 --> 00:23:51,765
WHERE THE SUN IS SHINING AND THE

584
00:23:51,765 --> 00:23:53,500
BIRDS ARE CHIRPING.

585
00:23:51,765 --> 00:23:53,500
>> OKAY.

586
00:23:51,765 --> 00:23:53,500
WE'RE OUT OF TIME.

587
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:58,805

>> OKAY.

593
00:24:05,245 --> 00:24:08,782
AYE, I POKED MY EYE AGAIN.

594
00:24:05,245 --> 00:24:08,782
>> THAT'S SAD.

595
00:24:05,245 --> 00:24:08,782
>> THAT'S SAD.

596
00:24:08,782 --> 00:24:12,652
>> THAT'S SAD.

597
00:24:08,782 --> 00:24:12,652
>> BYE.

598
00:24:19,526 --> 00:24:26,566
WELCOME TO THE FIRST PREVIEW OF

599
00:24:19,526 --> 00:24:26,566
A STORM WITHIN BY ACCLAIMED

600
00:24:19,526 --> 00:24:26,566
IRISH PLAYWRIGHT,

RORY McFADDEN.

602
00:24:26,566 --> 00:24:31,071
AND AS I'M SURE YOU'RE AWARE,

603
00:24:26,566 --> 00:24:31,071
THERE IS A PENIS IN THE SHOW.

604
00:24:31,071 --> 00:24:34,374
YES, WE GO THERE.

605
00:24:31,071 --> 00:24:34,374
AND IT BETTER NOT END UP ONLINE.

606
00:24:34,374 --> 00:24:38,511
IF YOU POST IT, YOU WILL LOSE

607
00:24:34,374 --> 00:24:38,511
THE PENIS.

608
00:24:38,511 --> 00:24:42,215
OKAY?

609
00:24:38,511 --> 00:24:42,215
SO JUST ENJOY IT AND THEN LET IT

610
00:24:38,511 --> 00:24:42,215
GO.

611
00:24:42,215 --> 00:24:48,855
ALSO, EVERYONE IN THE SHOW HAS

612
00:24:42,215 --> 00:24:48,855
COVID.

613
00:24:42,215 --> 00:24:48,855
SO THESE ARE ALL UNDERSTUDIES.

614
00:24:48,855 --> 00:24:56,730
THEY'VE HAD 30 MINUTES OF

615
00:24:48,855 --> 00:24:56,730
REHEARSAL BACKSTAGE.

616
00:24:48,855 --> 00:24:56,730
WE COULD HAVE CANCELED TONIGHT,

617
00:24:56,730 --> 00:24:59,599
BUT I'M IN A FIGHT WITH MY

618
00:24:56,730 --> 00:24:59,599
HUSBAND, SO I NEED TO BE OUT OF

619
00:24:56,730 --> 00:24:59,599
THE APARTMENT.

620
00:24:59,599 --> 00:25:04,304
OUR FIGHT MAY OR MAY NOT BE

621
00:24:59,599 --> 00:25:04,304
ABOUT THE PENIS IN THIS SHOW.

622
00:25:04,304 --> 00:25:09,776
THE PENIS IS ALSO BEING

623
00:25:04,304 --> 00:25:09,776
UNDERSTUDIED SO I'M EXCITED TO

624
00:25:04,304 --> 00:25:09,776
SEE WHAT THAT'S LIKE.

625
00:25:09,776 --> 00:25:11,945
ALL RIGHT.

626
00:25:09,776 --> 00:25:11,945
WITHOUT FURTHER TATTOO WE NOW

627
00:25:11,945 --> 00:25:17,717
PRESENT "A STORM WITHIN."

628
00:25:11,945 --> 00:25:17,717
>> OH, THIS IS GONNA BE GOOD.

629
00:25:11,945 --> 00:25:17,717
>> IS THAT WHAT YOU TOOK FROM

630
00:25:17,717 --> 00:25:29,295
THAT?

631
00:25:17,717 --> 00:25:29,295
>> LINE?

632
00:25:29,295 --> 00:25:34,501
>> ALREADY?

633
00:25:29,295 --> 00:25:34,501
YOU DON'T KNOW YOUR FIRST LINE?

634
00:25:29,295 --> 00:25:34,501
>> NO.

635
00:25:34,501 --> 00:25:41,074
>> WELL, IT'S "HUSH NOW BABY."

636
00:25:34,501 --> 00:25:41,074
>> OH, YEAH, YEAH,.

637
00:25:34,501 --> 00:25:41,074
HUSH NOW BABY DON'T WAKE YOUR

638
00:25:41,074 --> 00:25:43,410
MAM.

639

SHE'S SLEEPING OFF HER DRINK IN

640
00:25:41,074 --> 00:25:43,410
THE OTHER ROOM.

641
00:25:43,410 --> 00:25:46,079
BUT NAN'S HERE TO TAKE CARE

642
00:25:43,410 --> 00:25:46,079

LINE?

644
00:25:46,079 --> 00:25:49,816
>> YA.

645
00:25:46,079 --> 00:25:49,816
>> AND NAN'S HERE TO TAKE CARE

00:25:46,079 --> 00:25:49,816
OF YA.

647
00:25:49,816 --> 00:25:54,487
IS IT THE PENIS NOW?

648
00:25:49,816 --> 00:25:54,487
>> NO.

649
00:25:49,816 --> 00:25:54,487
IT'S IN ACT TWO.

650
00:25:54,487 --> 00:25:59,726
IT NEEDS AN HOUR TO PREP.

651
00:25:54,487 --> 00:25:59,726
>> WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH MY

652
00:25:54,487 --> 00:25:59,726
BABY?

653
00:25:59,726 --> 00:26:05,598
>> WHAT IS THAT ACCENT?

654
00:25:59,726 --> 00:26:05,598
>> SORRY, I TRIED IRISH, IT

655
00:26:05,598 --> 00:26:11,037
SOUNDS WEIRD SO I'M JUST DOING

656
00:26:05,598 --> 00:26:11,037
AUSTRALIAN.

657
00:26:05,598 --> 00:26:11,037
>> YOU'RE NOT DOING AUSTRALIAN.

658
00:26:11,037 --> 00:26:14,808
>> OH, I THINK I AM, MATE.

659
00:26:11,037 --> 00:26:14,808
>> PLEASE STOP.

660
00:26:11,037 --> 00:26:14,808
DO YOU AT LEAST KNOW YOUR LINES?

661
00:26:14,808 --> 00:26:18,778
>> YES.

662
00:26:14,808 --> 00:26:18,778
I NEED --

663
00:26:14,808 --> 00:26:18,778
LINE?

664
00:26:18,778 --> 00:26:23,049
>> I NEED MONEY FOR WHISKEY.

665
00:26:18,778 --> 00:26:23,049
>> SORRY, I DON'T HAVE ANY

666
00:26:18,778 --> 00:26:23,049
MONEY.

667
00:26:23,049 --> 00:26:27,821
>> NO, THAT'S YOUR LINE.

668
00:26:23,049 --> 00:26:27,821
JUST DO THE PLAY.

669
00:26:27,821 --> 00:26:31,624
>> YOU SAW HIM AGAIN, DIDN'T

670
00:26:27,821 --> 00:26:31,624
YOU?

671
00:26:27,821 --> 00:26:31,624
YOU ALWAYS ACT THIS WAY WHEN YOU

672
00:26:31,624 --> 00:26:38,231
SEE HIM.

673
00:26:31,624 --> 00:26:38,231
>> WHAT'S WRONG, ARE YOU AFRAID

674
00:26:31,624 --> 00:26:38,231
TO SAY HIS NAME?

675
00:26:38,231 --> 00:26:43,370
>> OF COURSE I'M NOT AFRAID.

676
00:26:38,231 --> 00:26:43,370
BUT YOU SAY IT FIRST JUST TO

677
00:26:38,231 --> 00:26:43,370
REMIND ME WHAT IT IS.

678
00:26:43,370 --> 00:26:47,507
>> YOU SHOULD SINCE YOU BROUGHT

679
00:26:43,370 --> 00:26:47,507
IT UP.

680
00:26:47,507 --> 00:26:50,243
>> OKAY.

681
00:26:47,507 --> 00:26:50,243
WELL, THEN LET'S JUST BOTH SAY

682
00:26:47,507 --> 00:26:50,243
IT AT THE SAME TIME.

683
00:26:50,243 --> 00:26:55,682
ONE, TWO, THREE.

684
00:26:50,243 --> 00:26:55,682
FOUR.

685
00:26:50,243 --> 00:26:55,682
>> FOUR.

686
00:26:55,682 --> 00:26:58,585
>> FIVE.

687
00:26:55,682 --> 00:26:58,585
>> I'M ASSUMING FROM THIS

688
00:26:55,682 --> 00:26:58,585
BACK-AND-FORTH THAT YOU BOTH

689
00:26:58,585 --> 00:27:02,555
FORGOT THE NAME.

690
00:26:58,585 --> 00:27:02,555
>> YES.

691
00:26:58,585 --> 00:27:02,555
>> IT'S SHEAMUS.

692
00:27:02,555 --> 00:27:06,693
>> OH, YEAH.

693
00:27:02,555 --> 00:27:06,693
OH.

694
00:27:02,555 --> 00:27:06,693
SHOULD WE DO THE KISS NOW?

695
00:27:06,693 --> 00:27:11,531
>> NO, NO, YOU ARE MOTHER AND

696
00:27:06,693 --> 00:27:11,531
DAUGHTER.

697
00:27:06,693 --> 00:27:11,531
THERE IS NO KISS.

698
00:27:11,531 --> 00:27:14,668
>> OH, MY GOD.

699
00:27:11,531 --> 00:27:14,668
THIS IS HORRIBLE.

700
00:27:11,531 --> 00:27:14,668
>> I KNOW.

701
00:27:14,668 --> 00:27:20,473
THINK OF HOW THAT BABY IS GOING

702
00:27:14,668 --> 00:27:20,473
TO GROW UP.

703
00:27:14,668 --> 00:27:20,473
>> WHY WON'T YOU GIVE ME THE

704
00:27:20,473 --> 00:27:28,515
MONEY, COW?

705
00:27:20,473 --> 00:27:28,515
>> WASH YOUR MOUTH.

706
00:27:20,473 --> 00:27:28,515
>> IT'S WATCH.

707
00:27:28,515 --> 00:27:31,951
>> OH, I'M SORRY, WASH YOUR

708
00:27:28,515 --> 00:27:31,951
WATCH.

709
00:27:31,951 --> 00:27:36,389
I DON'T CARE THAT YOU'RE MY

710
00:27:31,951 --> 00:27:36,389
DAUGHTER.

711
00:27:31,951 --> 00:27:36,389
I'D CALL THE POLICE.

712
00:27:36,389 --> 00:27:42,495
>> I'D BE CAREFUL.

713
00:27:36,389 --> 00:27:42,495
YOU'RE TREADING A VERY THIN

714
00:27:36,389 --> 00:27:42,495
LINE.

715
00:27:42,495 --> 00:27:44,364
>> LINE.

716
00:27:42,495 --> 00:27:44,364
>> YES, THAT'S WHAT I'M ASKING.

717
00:27:42,495 --> 00:27:44,364
>> NO, NO, LINE IS YOUR LINE.

718
00:27:44,364 --> 00:27:46,066
>> WHAT?

719
00:27:44,364 --> 00:27:46,066
>> WHAT.

720
00:27:44,364 --> 00:27:46,066
THE WORD LINE IS YOUR LINE.

721
00:27:46,066 --> 00:27:50,136
>> OH, LINE.

722
00:27:46,066 --> 00:27:50,136
>> NO.

723
00:27:50,136 --> 00:27:54,207
JUST KEEP GOING.

724
00:27:50,136 --> 00:27:54,207
>> WHO IS THAT?

725
00:27:50,136 --> 00:27:54,207
IS THAT PENIS --

726
00:27:54,207 --> 00:28:01,815
SHEAMUS.

727
00:27:54,207 --> 00:28:01,815
>> ONLY ONE WAY TO FIND OUT.

728
00:27:54,207 --> 00:28:01,815
>> NO, NO.

729
00:28:01,815 --> 00:28:03,516
>> WOW.

730
00:28:01,815 --> 00:28:03,516
SAYS HERE THE DOGS ARE

731
00:28:01,815 --> 00:28:03,516
UNDERSTUDIES TOO.

732
00:28:03,516 --> 00:28:07,454
>> OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

733
00:28:03,516 --> 00:28:07,454
I'M JUST GOING TO PLAY ALL OF

734
00:28:07,454 --> 00:28:10,590
THE PARTS.

735
00:28:07,454 --> 00:28:10,590
YOU'LL KNOW WHO I'M DOING

736
00:28:07,454 --> 00:28:10,590
BECAUSE I'LL BE DOING ALL OF THE

737
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:19,199
VOICES.

738
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:19,199
MAM, I DIDN'T WANT YOU TO DO

739
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:19,199
THIS, BUT YOU'VE LEFT ME NO

740
00:28:19,199 --> 00:28:22,202
CHOICE.

741
00:28:19,199 --> 00:28:22,202
IS THAT A GUN, GIRL?

742
00:28:19,199 --> 00:28:22,202
YEAH, MATE, I GOT IT FROM

743
00:28:22,202 --> 00:28:25,438
SHEAMUS.

744
00:28:22,202 --> 00:28:25,438
>> I'M SORRY, I KNOW I'M EARLY

745
00:28:22,202 --> 00:28:25,438
BUT IT'S READY AND IT NEEDS TO

746
00:28:25,438 --> 00:28:29,709
BE NOW.

747
00:28:25,438 --> 00:28:29,709
>> BUT IT'S NOT SUPPOSED TO BE

748
00:28:29,709 --> 00:28:37,050
UNTIL ACT TWO.

749
00:28:29,709 --> 00:28:37,050
>> IT HAS TO BE NOW!

750
00:28:29,709 --> 00:28:37,050
>> CAN YOU SAY THE LINE AT

751
00:28:37,050 --> 00:28:41,621
LEAST?

752
00:28:37,050 --> 00:28:41,621
>> CURSE OF THE IRISH, MORE LIKE

753
00:28:37,050 --> 00:28:41,621
BLESSING, WHAT TIME IS, DAWN

754
00:28:41,621 --> 00:28:47,160
O'CLOCK.

755
00:28:41,621 --> 00:28:47,160
AYUGA.

756
00:28:41,621 --> 00:28:47,160
>> OKAY.

757
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:52,132
THOSE ARE ACTUALLY THE LINES.

758
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:52,132
JUST GO AHEAD AND SHOW IT.

759
00:28:52,132 --> 00:28:59,072
>> WOW.

760
00:28:52,132 --> 00:28:59,072
THEY REALLY DID GO THERE.

761
00:28:52,132 --> 00:28:57,072
>> I TOLD YOU.

762
00:29:01,608 --> 00:29:05,491
>>> WE NOW RETURN TO "AMERICAN
INVENTORS."

763
00:29:06,267 --> 00:29:11,078
>> THE AUTOMOBILE, PAPER CUP,
DANCING, COMPUTER --

764
00:29:11,078 --> 00:29:13,100
THESE WERE ALL INVENTED.

765
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:15,581
BUT WHO DID THAT, AND WHAT IS
THEIR STORY?

766
00:29:15,581 --> 00:29:17,696
WE BEGIN WITH ARCHIE GIZMO,

767
00:29:17,696 --> 00:29:20,808
THE BRILLIANT INVENTOR OF THE
WHOOPEE CUSHION.

768
00:29:20,808 --> 00:29:24,781
>> WELL, BACK IN THE EARLY 60s,
I WAS JUST A STRUGGLING GAG
INVENTOR.

769
00:29:24,781 --> 00:29:27,999
AND ALL I HAD WAS AN EARLY
PROTOTYPE OF THE CUSHION.

770
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,362
I KNEW IT WOULD BE FUNNY TO HAVE
YOUR BOSS SIT DOWN,

771
00:29:30,362 --> 00:29:32,061
AND A NOISE COME FROM HIS BUTT,

772
00:29:32,061 --> 00:29:35,477
BUT I JUST
COULDN'T FIGURE OUT WHAT NOISE.

773
00:29:35,703 --> 00:29:37,058
NO.

774
00:29:37,058 --> 00:29:38,736
DAMN IT.

775
00:29:38,736 --> 00:29:39,914
I COULDN'T CRACK IT.

776
00:29:39,914 --> 00:29:42,923
BUT THEN, I MET HER.

777
00:29:45,816 --> 00:29:49,045
MISS DINA BEANS.
I SAW HER FROM AFAR.

778
00:29:49,045 --> 00:29:53,399
HER ENERGY WAS MAGNETIC.
HER EYES WERE ENDLESS.

779
00:29:53,399 --> 00:29:56,312
AND EVERY TIME SHE SAT DOWN --

780
00:29:56,708 --> 00:29:58,922
GAS.

781
00:30:00,161 --> 00:30:05,370
>> IT WAS THAT NIGHT HE
REALIZED, THE FUNNIEST NOISE TO
COME OUT OF A BUTT WAS A FART.

782
00:30:05,370 --> 00:30:08,377
>> WATCH OUT, SUBSTITUTE
TEACHERS.
DON'T SIT DOWN.

783
00:30:08,377 --> 00:30:10,447
THEY'RE CALLING IT THE "WHOOPEE
CUSHION."

784
00:30:10,447 --> 00:30:12,341
AND THEY'RE FLYING OFF THE
SHELVES.

785
00:30:12,341 --> 00:30:15,873
>> HE HAD A BONA FIDE HIT, AND
IT DIDN'T STOP THERE.

786
00:30:15,873 --> 00:30:17,939
DINA BEANS BECAME HIS MUSE.

787
00:30:17,939 --> 00:30:22,525
>> I FELL IN LOVE WITH DINA, AND
SHE WAS BEHIND EVERY GOOD IDEA I
EVER HAD.

788
00:30:22,525 --> 00:30:25,858
BECAUSE YOU SEE, SHE WASN'T JUST
A CHRONIC GAS-PASSER.

789
00:30:25,858 --> 00:30:30,740
SHE WAS ALSO THE VICIOUSLY MOST
UNLUCKY WOMAN I HAD EVER MET.

790
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:34,490
>> OH, YUM.
PEANUTS!

791
00:30:37,444 --> 00:30:39,985
MORE SNAKES!

792
00:30:39,985 --> 00:30:43,080
>> AND WHAT THE HELL COULD HAVE
BEEN GOING ON AT THE PEANUT FACTORY

793
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:47,565
FOR A SEALED CAN TO BE
FULL OF FOUR MULTI-COLORED,

794
00:30:47,565 --> 00:30:50,250
ALIVE, POISONOUS SNAKES?

795
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:53,704
>> WATCH OUT PEANUT FANS, MAYBE
IT'S TIME TO SWITCH TO PECANS.

796
00:30:53,704 --> 00:30:57,685
>> ARCHIE DILIGENTLY RECORDED
HOME FOOTAGE OF DINA'S EVERY
MOVE.

797
00:30:57,685 --> 00:31:01,348
HERE, DINA IS STRUCK BY
LIGHTNING WHILE SHAKING
SOMEONE'S HAND.

798
00:31:01,348 --> 00:31:03,892
>> HI, MISTER, NICE TO MEET YOU!

799
00:31:04,747 --> 00:31:06,964
>> OOH, THAT WAS THE HAND
BUZZER!

800
00:31:06,964 --> 00:31:08,712
VERY NEXT DAY, HAND TO GOD,

801
00:31:08,712 --> 00:31:12,658
HER EYEBALLS POPPED OUT OF HER
SOCKETS.

802
00:31:13,779 --> 00:31:15,347
>> OH, MY EYES FELL OUT.

803
00:31:15,347 --> 00:31:18,624
>> BOOM.
GOOGLY-EYED SLINKY GLASSES.

804
00:31:19,198 --> 00:31:20,617
>> THAT'S BETTER.

805
00:31:20,617 --> 00:31:23,360
>> THEN, LIGHTNING GOT THE WOMAN AGAIN,

806
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:26,397
THIS TIME WHILE TAKING A
PIECE OF GUM FROM A GUY.

807
00:31:26,397 --> 00:31:28,910
>> TOOTY FRUITY, MY FAVORITE --

808
00:31:28,910 --> 00:31:31,175
>> ELECTRIC GUM, THE GUM THAT
BITES BACK.

809
00:31:31,175 --> 00:31:35,888
>> HOW THIS WOMAN DID NOT DIE
BETWEEN TWO LIGHTNING STRIKES
AND A SNAKE ATTACK

810
00:31:35,888 --> 00:31:38,532
IS BETWEEN
HER AND GOD.

811
00:31:38,532 --> 00:31:41,401
BUT ARCHIE'S HIT PRANKS JUST
KEPT COMING.

812
00:31:41,401 --> 00:31:43,399
>> DINA GOT STRUCK BY LIGHTNING
ALMOST WEEKLY --

813
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:45,186
WHILE CLICKING THE PEN.

814
00:31:45,186 --> 00:31:47,896
>> ELECTRIC SHOCKER -- THE PEN
THAT GIVES AN ELECTRIC SHOCK.

815
00:31:47,896 --> 00:31:49,359
>> SITTING DOWN.

816
00:31:49,839 --> 00:31:51,791
>> ELECTRIC WHOOPEE CUSHION.

817
00:31:51,791 --> 00:31:53,632
>> SHE WAS GOD'S PERFECT FOOL.

818
00:31:53,632 --> 00:31:56,930
>> ARCHIE BECAME THE MOST FAMOUS

COMFORT THEM OR SOMETHING?

1566
01:03:55,506 --> 01:03:58,829

SO THEY ARE LOADED WITH
SUGAR RIGHT NOW.

>> YEAH.
IT LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE FIGHTING.

1580

>> THEY'RE JUST ROUGHHOUSING.

1581
01:04:47,620 --> 01:04:50,041
IT'S WHAT SIBLINGS DO.

1582
01:04:50,041 --> 01:04:55,230
>> WAIT, ACTUALLY, I HAVE A BABY
BROTHER AND SISTER AND I HAVE
NEVER SEEN THEM DO THAT.

1583
01:04:57,669 --> 01:04:59,883

FLIES OFF.

1585
01:05:06,444 --> 01:05:10,400
>> UGH, FINE.
I'LL JUST GO GIVE THEM A PIECE
OF BREAD OR SOMETHING.

1586
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:14,181
>> ARE BABIES SUPPOSED TO EAT
FULL PIECES OF BREAD?

1587
01:05:14,181 --> 01:05:19,969
>> I DON'T THINK SO.
BUT THE BABIES DEFINITELY SEEM
TO LIKE IT.

1588
01:05:27,663 --> 01:05:32,364
>> ALL RIGHT.
NOW WHO WANTS TO FOCUS ON
GETTING WASTED?

1589
01:05:32,364 --> 01:05:34,363
>> HONESTLY, I DON'T WANT TO GET
DRUNK ANYMORE.

1590
01:05:34,363 --> 01:05:37,649
I JUST WANT TO SIT HERE AND
WATCH THESE BABIES GO HARD.

1591

1594
01:05:47,673 --> 01:05:50,964
>> WHO IS THAT?
>> I DON'T KNOW.

1595
01:05:50,964 --> 01:05:53,836
SOMETIMES HE'S THERE AND
SOMETIMES HE'S NOT.

1596
01:05:53,836 --> 01:05:57,414
>> THAT'S NOT CONCERNING TO YOU?
>> NO.

1597
01:05:57,414 --> 01:06:00,917
NOW, WHO WANTS TO CHUG HAND
SANITIZER AND TRY ON MY DAD'S
UNDERWEAR?

1598
01:06:00,917 --> 01:06:02,437

PARTY SO HARD?
THESE BABIES NEED YOU.

1601
01:06:09,233 --> 01:06:14,143
>> LOOK, GUYS.
THIS MIGHT COME AS A COMPLETE
SHOCK TO YOU

1602
01:06:14,143 --> 01:06:16,476
BUT I'M NOT A HUGE
PARTY GIRL.

1603
01:06:16,476 --> 01:06:18,623
I'VE NEVER EVEN HAD A SIP OF
ALCOHOL.

1604
