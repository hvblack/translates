THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH FOR COMING

PRESS SECRETARY JEN PSAKI FOR
HAVING THE VISION TO SET THIS
UP.

14

>> I SUGGESTED IT AS A JOKE, AND
THEN IT ACTUALLY HAPPENED.

FIRST

16
00:00:50,812 --> 00:00:54,268
THIS IS TOUGH ON ME BECAUSE
I'M THE LANDLINE OF PRESIDENTS.

17
00:00:54,268 --> 00:00:56,278
THAT'S WHY I NEED YOU.

18
00:00:56,278 --> 00:01:00,238
I UNDERSTAND PUTIN.
I UNDERSTAND WAR.

19
00:01:00,238 --> 00:01:03,197
BUT THERE'S ONE THING I DON'T
UNDERSTAND.

20
00:01:03,197 --> 00:01:05,488
THAT'S COMPUTER.

21
00:01:05,488 --> 00:01:09,214
>> HE MEANS TECHNOLOGY BUT HE
SAYS COMPUTER.

22
00:01:09,214 --> 00:01:11,458

MEAN TO ME.

COMPUTER SAY, DID YOU MEAN
MAGENTA?"

26
00:01:22,027 --> 00:01:28,102
>> THE POINT IS WE NEED FRESH
IDEAS FROM YOU GUYS ABOUT HOW WE
CAN WIN THE INFORMATION WAR ON
SOCIAL MEDIA.

27
00:01:28,102 --> 00:01:29,083
YES, YOU.

28
00:01:29,083 --> 00:01:32,722
>> HEY, GUYS.
I'M AN ACTRESS FROM THE CW.

>> GREAT, WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
>> ACTRESS FROM THE CW.

30
00:01:37,035 --> 00:01:40,143
AND WHILE PUTIN MAY HAVE TANKS AND BOMBS,

31
00:01:40,143 --> 00:01:44,163
THERE'S SOMETHING
EVEN MORE POWERFUL WE CAN ATTACK
HIM WITH.

32
00:01:44,163 --> 00:01:45,367
POEMS.

33
00:01:45,367 --> 00:01:48,362
>> OH, NO, IT'S THAT GIRL.

34
00:01:48,362 --> 00:01:51,567
>> DEAR VLADAMIR PUTIN,

35
00:01:51,567 --> 00:01:53,810
IF I WAS YOUR MOTHER,

36
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:56,678
I WOULD LOVE YOU
MORE.

37
00:01:56,678 --> 00:01:59,283
IF I WAS YOUR WIFE,

38
00:01:59,283 --> 00:02:03,719
I WOULD HAVE
BEEN SO, SO, SO MAD AT YOU.

39

BABY BROTHER

40
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:09,776
>> THANK YOU.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

41
00:02:09,776 --> 00:02:13,239
DO YOU HAVE ANY ACTUAL USEFUL
SUGGESTIONS?

42
00:02:13,239 --> 00:02:14,692
>> OH, SURE.

43
00:02:14,692 --> 00:02:18,736
HERE ARE FIVE WAYS TO STOP THE
WAR IN UKRAINE.

44
00:02:24,149 --> 00:02:27,176
>> WHAT'S THAT MEAN?
YOU SEE ANYTHING?

45
00:02:27,176 --> 00:02:31,555
>> I THINK SHE'S EXPECTING TECH
TO SHOW UP.
>> OKAY.

46
00:02:31,555 --> 00:02:34,064
HEY, YOU.
WHAT'S YOUR THING?

47
00:02:34,064 --> 00:02:39,473
>> OH, ME?
LET'S JUST SAY I DO RAPS AND
PRANKS.

48
00:02:39,473 --> 00:02:42,385
MAYBE YOU'VE HEARD OF MY SQUAD,
THE BOO-BOO BOYS?

49
00:02:42,385 --> 00:02:46,070
>> I THINK YOU KNOW THE
PRESIDENT HAS NEVER HEARD OF THE
BOO-BOO BOYS.

50
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:49,722
>> WAIT A SECOND.
THE BOO-BOO BOYS?

51
00:02:49,722 --> 00:02:54,517
DON'T YOU LIVE IN THE YEESH
HOUSE WITH ONE NET KEVIN AND
DUMBASS LARRY?

52
00:02:54,517 --> 00:02:57,252
>> OH-OH, WE GOT A BOO-BOO HEAD!

53
00:02:57,252 --> 00:03:02,562
>> Y'ALL, ONE TIME THEY PRANKED
A WOMAN DOWN FIVE FLIGHTS OF
STAIRS, IT WAS HILARIOUS.

54
00:03:02,562 --> 00:03:05,078
>> WELL, THAT SOUNDS LIKE AN
AMAZING HOBBY.

55
00:03:05,078 --> 00:03:07,584
>> WE MADE $13 MILLION LAST
YEAR.

56
00:03:07,584 --> 00:03:09,163
>> GOD, I HATE THIS WORLD.

57
00:03:09,163 --> 00:03:13,755
AND DID YOU HAVE A PLAN FOR HOW
TO DEFEAT PUTIN?

58
00:03:13,832 --> 00:03:15,694
>> OH, YEAH, I'M COOKING
SOMETHING UP.

59
00:03:15,694 --> 00:03:19,026
>> IS IT PUSHING HIM DOWN A
FLIGHT OF STAIRS?

60
00:03:19,026 --> 00:03:22,342
>> IT IS.
>> GREAT.

61
00:03:22,342 --> 00:03:25,704
ALL RIGHT.
WHAT ABOUT YOU?
* JASON DERULO *

62
00:03:25,704 --> 00:03:28,683

CUTE.

67

>> THANKS.
I DO SILLY ANIMAL MAKEUP FOR
KIDS.

68
00:03:46,477 --> 00:03:50,500
>> WELL, THAT'S ADORABLE.
WHAT DO YOU THINK WE CAN DO TO
WIN THIS WAR?

69
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:55,813
>> OH, YOU MEAN THE ONE STARTED
BY YOUR SON, HUNTER BIDEN.

70
00:03:55,813 --> 00:03:57,952
WHEN HE AND HIS PALS AT BURISMA --

71
00:03:57,952 --> 00:03:59,986
WHERE'S THE LAPTOP,
IS IT IN THIS ROOM?

72
00:03:59,986 --> 00:04:02,641
>> OKAY, THANK YOU, SWEETHEART.

ANIMAL

74
00:04:07,222 --> 00:04:10,594
WHAT ABOUT THIS RANDOM
MIDDLE-AGED GUY?

75
00:04:10,594 --> 00:04:14,087
>> HELLO.

76
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:17,606
MY NAME IS CHARLES F. D'AMELIO.

77
00:04:17,606 --> 00:04:20,088
I'M A ROOFER FROM PITTSBURGH.

78
00:04:20,088 --> 00:04:23,235
>> OKAY.
WHY ARE YOU HERE?

79
00:04:23,235 --> 00:04:25,131
>> I DON'T KNOW.

80
00:04:25,374 --> 00:04:29,634
I SUSPECT MAYBE THAT YOU HAVE
CONFUSED ME FOR CHARLI D'AMELIO,

81
00:04:29,634 --> 00:04:35,072
THE 17-YEAR-OLD GIRL WITH
130 MILLION FOLLOWERS ON TIKTOK.

82
00:04:35,072 --> 00:04:36,630
>> SOUNDS RIGHT, YEAH.

83
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:38,757
>> SO I TELL YOU WHAT, I'M JUST
GOING TO HEAD OUT.

84
00:04:38,757 --> 00:04:41,147
BUT FIRST,

85
00:04:41,147 --> 00:04:46,052
DO Y'ALL HAPPEN TO HAVE ONE OF THOSE COVID STIMMY
CHECKS AROUND, BY ANY CHANCE?

86
00:04:46,052 --> 00:04:49,270
>> AFRAID NOT.
>> WE DON'T, I'M SO SORRY.

87
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:51,942
>> ALL RIGHT, GOOD LUCK WITH THE
WORLD WAR.

88
00:04:51,942 --> 00:04:55,127
NOT WHAT YOU CARE WHAT A ROOFER
THINKS ABOUT PUTIN, BUT

89
00:04:55,235 --> 00:04:58,103
MAYBE
YOU SHOULD PUT SOMEONE UP ON A
ROOF AND --

90
00:04:58,103 --> 00:05:00,407
BAM BAM BAM.

91
00:05:00,407 --> 00:05:02,537
Y'ALL HAVE A GOOD ONE.

92
00:05:02,538 --> 00:05:04,658
THANK

IT'S DOWN TO YOU.
WHAT DO YOU DO?

94
00:05:08,529 --> 00:05:11,924
>> WHO, ME?
OH, I JUST GO UP BEHIND PEOPLE ON THE STREET

95
00:05:11,924 --> 00:05:17,489
WITH THIS WEIRD
PIPE AND I GO -- OONGYANGYO!

96
00:05:17,489 --> 00:05:20,260
>> WHAT WOULD YOU DO ABOUT
UKRAINE?

97
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:26,710
>> I WOULD GO UP BEHIND THE
RUSSIAN TANKS AND GO OONGYANGYO.

98
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:29,207
>> AND HOW DID YOU GET HERE
TODAY?

99
00:05:29,207 --> 00:05:31,903
>> YOU FLEW ME FIRST CLASS FROM
CALIFORNIA,

100
00:05:31,903 --> 00:05:34,297
AND ON THE PLANE,I
WENT UP THERE TO THE PILOT

101
00:05:34,297 --> 00:05:39,223
AND I
SAID, "OONGYANGYO."

102
00:05:39,223 --> 00:05:41,893
>> THAT'S ACTUALLY BEST PLAN
I'VE HEARD SO FAR.

103
00:05:41,894 --> 00:05:45,764
HEARD

104
00:05:45,764 --> 00:05:48,618
HEY, HEY, SORRY I'M LATE, GUYS.

105
00:05:51,618 --> 00:05:54,765
SECURITY WAS GIVING ME A HARD
TIME.

106
00:05:54,765 --> 00:05:57,179
>> OKAY, THIS IS AWESOME.
WHO THE HECK ARE YOU?

107
00:05:57,179 --> 00:06:02,663
>> I DO A PUNCH OF INSANE TRICKS
USING A TOILET PLUNGER STUCK TO
MY NIPPLES.

108
00:06:02,663 --> 00:06:05,440
I'M ONE OF THE FAMOUS PEOPLE ON TIKTOK,

109
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,748
IT'S LIKE ME AND
REESE WITHERSPOON.

110
00:06:07,748 --> 00:06:11,735
>> OKAY, WELL WE'RE ACTUALLY
ABOUT TO WRAP THIS MEETING UP
BECAUSE IT WAS CLEARLY A BAD
IDEA.

111
00:06:11,735 --> 00:06:13,466
>> HEY, DON'T DO THAT.

112
00:06:13,466 --> 00:06:17,585
DON'T JUST TEAR THE PLUNGER OFF
THE NIPPLE LIKE THAT.

113
00:06:17,585 --> 00:06:21,846
YOU KNOW, THE IDEA OF ASKING
TIKTOK STARS HOW TO FIGHT RUSSIA

114
00:06:21,846 --> 00:06:23,509
MIGHT SOUND LIKE A JOKE,

115
00:06:23,509 --> 00:06:27,665
BUT
REMEMBER, THEY SAID THE SAME
THING ABOUT THE RADIO IN WORLD
WAR II.

116
00:06:27,665 --> 00:06:31,264
NEVER UNDERESTIMATE THE
IMPORTANCE OF NEW TECHNOLOGY

117
00:06:31,264 --> 00:06:33,252
AND
YOUNG PEOPLE.

118
00:06:33,253 --> 00:06:35,941
NEVER UNDERSTAND

119
00:06:35,941 --> 00:06:38,864
GIMMICKS

120
00:06:38,864 --> 00:06:43,909
MAY HAVE MORE POWER AND
INFLUENCE THAN THE "NIGHTLY
NEWS."

121
00:06:43,909 --> 00:06:46,603
THAT WAS TRULY INSPIRING, YOUNG
MAN.

122
00:06:46,603 --> 00:06:49,135
>> OH, I'M 55.

123
00:06:49,135 --> 00:06:52,847
NOW IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME, I'M
GOING TO GO MOVE THIS PLUNGER TO MY CROTCH,

124
00:06:52,847 --> 00:06:56,421
ATTACH A KNIFE TO THE
END, AND TRY TO SLICE AN APPLE
IN HALF.

125
00:06:56,421 --> 00:06:58,457
GOD BLESS AMERICA!

126
00:06:58,457 --> 00:07:02,939
>> AND LIVE FROM NEW YORK, IT'S
SATURDAY NIGHT!

127
00:09:04,811 --> 00:09:07,681
MUSICAL GUEST, ROSALIA

128
00:09:07,681 --> 00:09:09,282
MUSICAL GUEST, ROSALIA

129
00:09:07,681 --> 00:09:09,282
AND YOUR HOST, ZOE KRAVITZ!

130
00:09:13,998 --> 00:09:18,843
LADIES

131
00:09:35,525 --> 00:09:38,933
>> THANK YOU.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

132
00:09:38,933 --> 00:09:43,783
IT IS SO FANTASTIC TO BE HERE.
I'M YOUR HOST, ZOE KRAVITZ.

133
00:09:45,484 --> 00:09:50,065
I CURRENTLY HAVE A NEW MOVIE OUT
CALLED "THE BATMAN."

134
00:09:51,159 --> 00:09:53,268
CAT

135
00:09:53,268 --> 00:09:55,104
THE CATWOMAN

136
00:09:55,104 --> 00:09:59,600
TO PREPARE FOR THE ROLE, I
WATCHED THE MOVIE MUSICAL "CATS"
EVERY DAY FOR A YEAR.

137
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:04,919
WHICH IS ACTUALLY HOW I HEARD
JOAQUIN PHOENIX PREPARED TO PLAY
THE JOKER.

138
00:10:04,919 --> 00:10:08,253
>> SOMEONE HERE TALKING ABOUT
CATS?

139
00:10:11,738 --> 00:10:14,575
>> I WAS, YEAH.
I WAS JUST DOING THE MONOLOGUE.

140
00:10:14,679 --> 00:10:16,796
YOU'RE ALSO CATWOMAN?
>> YES.

141
00:10:16,796 --> 00:10:20,649
I'M CATWOMAN FROM THE '90S.
THE ONE WITH THE WHIP.

142
00:10:20,649 --> 00:10:23,466
YOU KNOW.
LIKE CATS HAVE.

143
00:10:24,754 --> 00:10:29,586
SO YOU'RE PART OF A PROUD
LINEAGE OF CATWOMEN,

144
00:10:29,586 --> 00:10:31,636
EACH WITH
OUR OWN ORIGIN STORIES.

145
00:10:31,636 --> 00:10:35,687
DO YOU WANT TO KNOW MINE?
>> YEAH, SURE, WHAT'S YOURS?

146
00:10:35,687 --> 00:10:41,000
>> I FELL OUT OF A WINDOW INTO A
PILE OF CATS.
THEY LICKED ME BACK TO LIFE,

147
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,138
AND
NOW IT'S JUST LIKE SANDY FROM A
PORNO VERSION OF "GREASE."

148
00:10:45,138 --> 00:10:49,131
IT'S STILL CALLED "GREASE."

149
00:10:49,131 --> 00:10:50,943
>> COOL.

150
00:10:50,943 --> 00:10:54,597
WELL -- THANK YOU, IT'S REALLY
GREAT TO HAVE A FELLOW CATWOMAN
SUPPORT.

151
00:10:54,597 --> 00:10:55,793
I SHOULD PROBABLY GET BACK TO --

152
00:10:55,793 --> 00:10:58,349
>> HANG ON, WE MUST FIRE UP THE
CAT SIGNAL.

153
00:10:58,439 --> 00:11:00,063
>> I'M SORRY, CAT SIGNAL?

154
00:11:00,144 --> 00:11:02,638
>> YEAH, FOR ANY TIME YOU NEED A
CATWOMAN.

155
00:11:02,638 --> 00:11:04,773
BEHOLD.

156
00:11:09,199 --> 00:11:13,911
I LOVE THAT.
IT'S A NOBLE CAT READY TO POUNCE
OFF THE LEDGE.

157
00:11:13,911 --> 00:11:16,326
>> OR MAYBE IT'S JUST DOING ITS
BIZ IN THE LITTER BOX.

158
00:11:16,326 --> 00:11:19,934
>> I SAW THE SIGNAL, IS SOMEONE
IN DANGER?

159
00:11:23,716 --> 00:11:25,829
TOO

160
00:11:25,829 --> 00:11:29,382
>> INDUBITABLY.
I WAS THE FIRST BLACK CATWOMAN.

161
00:11:29,382 --> 00:11:33,053
>> RIGHT, YES, OF COURSE,
EARTHA KITT FROM THE 1960S TV
VERSION.

162
00:11:33,053 --> 00:11:37,576
>> YEAH, PEOPLE CALLED IT CAMPY,
TURNS OUT IT WAS SUPER GAY.

163
00:11:37,576 --> 00:11:40,546
BE GRATEFUL YOUR OUTFIT ISN'T LATEX

164
00:11:40,546 --> 00:11:43,993
BECAUSE THIS IS HOW I
SNEAK UP ON BAD GUYS.

165
00:11:46,427 --> 00:11:52,805
NICE HAVING ALL THIS CATWOMAN ENERGY UP HERE,

166
00:11:52,805 --> 00:11:54,716
BUT I REALLY
SHOULD GET BACK TO THE
MONOLOGUE.

167
00:11:54,716 --> 00:11:56,969
SO CAN WE TURN OFF THE CAT
SIGNAL BEFORE WE --

168
00:11:56,969 --> 00:12:00,856
>> BEFORE ME?

169
00:12:04,533 --> 00:12:06,497
>> ANOTHER CATWOMAN?

170
00:12:06,566 --> 00:12:09,883
>> YEAH.
YEAH, I'M MORE OF A CAT LADY, I
GUESS.

171
00:12:09,883 --> 00:12:13,520
THIS IS MY HUSBAND.
SORRY CAT,

172
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:16,641
AND WE'RE HERE TO
MEET ROSALIA.

173
00:12:16,641 --> 00:12:19,728
DO YOU TAKE ME TO HER OR HOW
DOES THAT WORK?

174
00:12:19,728 --> 00:12:23,519
>> I DON'T THINK I CAN DO THAT
RIGHT NOW, I KIND OF HAVE TO
HOST THE SHOW, SO --

175
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:25,798
>> OH, YEAH.
I GET IT.

176
00:12:25,798 --> 00:12:28,683
YOU KNOW, I HOSTED THE SHOW
DOZENS OF TIMES.

177
00:12:28,758 --> 00:12:32,665
IN MY MIND.
WHERE IT'S CALLED "SATURDAY
NIGHT CATS."

178
00:12:32,665 --> 00:12:37,562
>> NOT "CATURDAY NIGHT LIVE"?
>> DANG IT.

179
00:12:37,752 --> 00:12:42,582
MEET SO MANY CAT -- PEOPLE.

180
00:12:42,582 --> 00:12:44,866
AND NOT THAT I'M NOT LOVING IT,
BUT MAYBE THAT'S ENOUGH, SO
LET'S JUST --

181
00:12:44,866 --> 00:12:48,378
>> EVEN IF THE NEXT ONE WAS DOJA
CAT?
>> OH, MY GOD, IS SHE HERE?

182
00:12:48,378 --> 00:12:54,004
>> NO, BUT THEY WERE ABLE TO GET
ME.
IT IS I, KAT WILLIAMS!

183
00:12:54,004 --> 00:12:56,124
>> COME ON.
YOU'RE NOT EVEN A WOMAN.

184
00:12:56,124 --> 00:12:59,248
>> I AM A LOVER OF WOMEN, MEOW!

185
00:12:59,248 --> 00:13:01,358
AND IF I WANTED TO MEET ROSALIA,
HOW WOULD I DO THAT?

186
00:13:01,358 --> 00:13:04,049
>> SERIOUSLY, IS THERE AN OFF
BUTTON SOMEWHERE?

187
00:13:04,136 --> 00:13:07,203
>> THE CAT SIGNAL BROUGHT US ALL
TOGETHER.

188
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:09,659
WORLD NEEDS

189
00:13:09,659 --> 00:13:12,393
CAN GET.

190
00:13:12,393 --> 00:13:14,428
NOW LET'S GO FIGHT SOME CRIME,

191
00:13:14,428 --> 00:13:16,672
YES!

192
00:13:17,369 --> 00:13:21,629
>> OKAY.

193
00:13:21,629 --> 00:13:24,590
BEEN TRYING TO SAY.

194
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:27,588
WHICH IS, WE'VE GOT A GREAT SHOW
FOR YOU TONIGHT.
ROSALIA IS HERE.

195
00:13:27,588 --> 00:13:30,894
STICK AROUND, AND WE'LL BE RIGHT
BACK!

196
00:13:39,653 --> 00:13:45,625
>>> I ALWAYS GOT THE SENSE THAT

197
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:45,625
MATT LOOKED DOWN ON ME, BUT

198
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:45,625
THAT'S ONLY 'CAUSE HE'S TWO

199
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:47,861
INCHES TALLER.

200
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:47,861
NO, BUT I'M SO HAPPY FOR YOU,

201
00:13:47,861 --> 00:13:53,833
BUDDY, I LOVE YOU, BRO.

202
00:13:47,861 --> 00:13:53,833
TO MATT AND TANYA, CHEERS!

203
00:13:47,861 --> 00:13:53,833
>> OKAY.

204
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:59,372
YES, HOW ABOUT A HAND FOR MATT'S

205
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:59,372
BEST MAN, NATE!

206
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:59,372
ALL RIGHT!

207
00:13:59,372 --> 00:14:02,275
YAY.

208
00:13:59,372 --> 00:14:02,275
I'M SO SORRY I'M CHEWING, THAT

209
00:14:02,275 --> 00:14:09,683
WAS JUST AN INCREDIBLY SHORT

210
00:14:02,275 --> 00:14:09,683
SPEECH.

211
00:14:02,275 --> 00:14:09,683
IT OPENED WITH THAT "LOOKED DOWN

212
00:14:09,683 --> 00:14:12,385
ON ME" JOKE, AND, IT JUST KIND

213
00:14:09,683 --> 00:14:12,385
OF ENDED A FEW SENTENCES LATER.

214
00:14:09,683 --> 00:14:12,385
SO I WAS SURE IT WOULD BE

215
00:14:12,385 --> 00:14:16,890
LONGER, WHICH IS WHY I TOOK A

216
00:14:12,385 --> 00:14:16,890
BITE OF FOOD, BUT I WAS WRONG.

217
00:14:12,385 --> 00:14:16,890
BUT STILL, A VERY NICE SPEECH

218
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:20,193
FROM NATE.

219
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:20,193
OKAY.

220
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:20,193
NOW LET'S HEAR FROM THE MAID OF

221
00:14:20,193 --> 00:14:24,197
HONOR.

222
00:14:20,193 --> 00:14:24,197
IT'S TANYA'S BEST FRIEND, SARAH,

223
00:14:20,193 --> 00:14:24,197
COME ON UP, SARAH!

224
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:29,869
>> YEAH!

225
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:29,869
>> HI, EVERYONE.

226
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:35,709
I'M SARAH.

227
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:35,709
UM, MATT, LET ME JUST TELL YOU

228
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:35,709
SOMETHING.

229
00:14:35,709 --> 00:14:40,747
YOU'RE A REALLY LUCKY GUY.

230
00:14:35,709 --> 00:14:40,747
BECAUSE TANYA IS THE BEST GIRL

231
00:14:35,709 --> 00:14:40,747
IN THE WORLD.

232
00:14:40,747 --> 00:14:45,085
>> AW.

233
00:14:40,747 --> 00:14:45,085
>> I MEAN, THIS GIRL IS LIKE --

234
00:14:40,747 --> 00:14:45,085
>> YES, SHE IS.

235
00:14:45,085 --> 00:14:49,989
>> SHE'S LIKE A SISTER TO ME.

236
00:14:45,085 --> 00:14:49,989
AND NOT JUST BECAUSE WE'VE BOTH

237
00:14:45,085 --> 00:14:49,989
SEEN MY DAD NAKED.

238
00:14:49,989 --> 00:14:53,093
>> OKAY.

239
00:14:49,989 --> 00:14:53,093
>> SHE'S ALWAYS HAD MY BACK.

240
00:14:53,093 --> 00:14:58,665
EVEN WHEN NOBODY ELSE AGREED

241
00:14:53,093 --> 00:14:58,665
WITH ME, SHE ALWAYS SAID,

242
00:14:53,093 --> 00:14:58,665
"SARAH, IF YOU SAY YOU'RE SOBER

243
00:14:58,665 --> 00:15:02,535
ENOUGH TO DRIVE THEN I BELIEVE

244
00:14:58,665 --> 00:15:02,535
YOU."

245
00:14:58,665 --> 00:15:02,535
AND THAT MEANT THE WORLD TO ME,

246
00:15:02,535 --> 00:15:07,374
GIRLIE.

247
00:15:02,535 --> 00:15:07,374
AND WHEN I STUMBLE, WHEN I MAKE

248
00:15:02,535 --> 00:15:07,374
A MISTAKE, SHE'D NEVER MAKE ME

249
00:15:07,374 --> 00:15:11,044
FEEL BAD.

250
00:15:07,374 --> 00:15:11,044
SHE'D SAY, "GIRLIE, DON'T BEAT

251
00:15:07,374 --> 00:15:11,044
YOURSELF UP, NOBODY KNEW THAT

252
00:15:11,044 --> 00:15:18,151
THING WAS LOADED."

253
00:15:11,044 --> 00:15:18,151
>> DID SHE SHOOT SOMEONE?

254
00:15:11,044 --> 00:15:18,151
>> BABE, I'M TRYING TO LISTEN.

255
00:15:18,151 --> 00:15:24,491
>> AND WHEN SHE'S GOING THROUGH

256
00:15:18,151 --> 00:15:24,491
A TOUGH TIME HERSELF, SHE

257
00:15:18,151 --> 00:15:24,491
DOESN'T COMPLAIN, SHE DANCES.

258
00:15:24,491 --> 00:15:30,897
PROFESSIONALLY.

259
00:15:24,491 --> 00:15:30,897
>> WHAT KIND OF DANCING?

260
00:15:24,491 --> 00:15:30,897
>> BABE?

261
00:15:30,897 --> 00:15:37,303
>> LIKE, SHE'S NOT PERFECT.

262
00:15:30,897 --> 00:15:37,303
>> NO WAY.

263
00:15:30,897 --> 00:15:37,303
>> WHAT KIND OF DANCING?

264
00:15:37,303 --> 00:15:43,777
>> SHE HAS BEEN A BIT OF A

265
00:15:37,303 --> 00:15:43,777
BRIDEZILLA, AND NOT JUST BECAUSE

266
00:15:37,303 --> 00:15:43,777
SHE ATTACKED A LOT OF JAPANESE

267
00:15:43,777 --> 00:15:54,220
PEOPLE.

268
00:15:43,777 --> 00:15:54,220
I AM IN AWE OF HER.

269
00:15:43,777 --> 00:15:54,220
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT ALL OF YOU,

270
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:56,756
BUT IF MY LAST 15 BOYFRIENDS

271
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:56,756
KILLED THEMSELVES, I'D GIVE UP

272
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:56,756
ON ROMANCE.

273
00:15:56,756 --> 00:16:01,428
BUT NOT TANYA.

274
00:15:56,756 --> 00:16:01,428
>> SHE'S -- SHE'S JOKING, RIGHT?

275
00:15:56,756 --> 00:16:01,428
>> 'CAUSE SHE BELIEVES IN LOVE.

276
00:16:01,428 --> 00:16:05,632
WHEN I STARTED DATING MY

277
00:16:01,428 --> 00:16:05,632
NOW-HUSBAND, SHE WAS SO HAPPY

278
00:16:01,428 --> 00:16:05,632
FOR ME.

279
00:16:05,632 --> 00:16:10,103
EVERYONE ELSE SAID, "YOU'RE A

280
00:16:05,632 --> 00:16:10,103
MONSTER."

281
00:16:05,632 --> 00:16:10,103
BUT WHAT DID YOU SAY, GIRLIE?

282
00:16:10,103 --> 00:16:20,046
>> "YOU'RE NOT A MONSTER, YOU'RE

283
00:16:10,103 --> 00:16:20,046
JUST HIS MATH TEACHER."

284
00:16:10,103 --> 00:16:20,046
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

285
00:16:20,046 --> 00:16:25,885
LOVE IS LOVE, RIGHT, BABY?

286
00:16:20,046 --> 00:16:25,885
>> NO DOUBT.

287
00:16:20,046 --> 00:16:25,885
>> BUT MOST OF ALL, TANYA IS

288
00:16:25,885 --> 00:16:28,321
BRAVE.

289
00:16:25,885 --> 00:16:28,321
GIRLIE, I KNOW YOU REMEMBER

290
00:16:25,885 --> 00:16:28,321
THIS.

291
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:31,624
WE WERE AT A PROTEST FIGHTING

292
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:31,624
FOR JUSTICE.

293
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:31,624
AND YOU GOT RIGHT IN THAT COP'S

294
00:16:31,624 --> 00:16:35,628
FACE.

295
00:16:31,624 --> 00:16:35,628
NO FEAR AT ALL.

296
00:16:31,624 --> 00:16:35,628
AND DO YOU REMEMBER WHAT YOU

297
00:16:35,628 --> 00:16:42,068
SAID?

298
00:16:35,628 --> 00:16:42,068
>> "I'M STORMING THE CAPITOL AND

299
00:16:35,628 --> 00:16:42,068
I'M GOING TO KILL MIKE PENCE."

300
00:16:42,068 --> 00:16:54,080
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

301
00:16:42,068 --> 00:16:54,080
AND MATT, YOU MAKE HER SO HAPPY.

302
00:16:42,068 --> 00:16:54,080
I DON'T WANT TO EMBARRASS YOU,

303
00:16:54,080 --> 00:17:00,620
BUT WHEN YOU GUYS FIRST GOT

304
00:16:54,080 --> 00:17:00,620
TOGETHER, ME AND TONIA ARE

305
00:16:54,080 --> 00:17:00,620
HAVING SOME GIRL TALK AND I

306
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:03,556
SAID, YOU KNOW, "HOW'S THE

307
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:03,556
CHEMISTRY IN THE BEDROOM?"

308
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:03,556
>> HA, NO, HERE WE GO.

309
00:17:03,556 --> 00:17:07,260
>> AND SHE SAID, "HE'S TRYING

310
00:17:03,556 --> 00:17:07,260
HIS BEST."

311
00:17:03,556 --> 00:17:07,260
AND THAT'S WHAT MAKES MATT

312
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:10,030
DIFFERENT FROM THE HUNDREDS AND

313

CASSIE, YOU KNOW, MY -- MY

489
00:23:32,212 --> 00:23:36,816
PARENTS SAID I WAS VERY

490
00:23:32,212 --> 00:23:36,816
EMOTIONALLY MATURE WHEN WE PUT

491
00:23:32,212 --> 00:23:36,816
DOWN MY TURTLE.

492
00:23:36,816 --> 00:23:41,588
>> OH, WELL, AT LEAST HE DIDN'T

493
00:23:36,816 --> 00:23:41,588
SUFFER.

>> WELL, HE ACTUALLY DID, THE

496
00:23:41,588 --> 00:23:42,622
DOCTOR DIDN'T HIT HIM IN THE

497
00:23:41,588 --> 00:23:42,622
RIGHT SPOT.

498
00:23:46,259 --> 00:23:48,728
SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE REALLY

499
00:23:46,259 --> 00:23:48,728
STRONG.

500
00:23:46,259 --> 00:23:48,728
>> JASON, AGAINST ALL ODDS, I AM

501
00:23:48,728 --> 00:23:56,169
CONTINUING TO CRUSH.

502
00:23:48,728 --> 00:23:56,169
>> WITH MY ADVICE, I CAN'T FEIGN

503
00:23:48,728 --> 00:23:56,169
SURPRISE.

504
00:23:56,169 --> 00:24:00,607
BUT YOU NEED TO FIND OUT IF SHE

505
00:23:56,169 --> 00:24:00,607
IS AVAILABLE.

00:24:00,607 --> 00:24:05,311
PLEASE HOLD.

508
00:24:00,607 --> 00:24:05,311
CASSIE, ARE YOU CURRENTLY DATING

509
00:24:00,607 --> 00:24:05,311
ANYONE?

510
00:24:05,311 --> 00:24:13,386
>> NO, I'M DONE WITH JOCKS.

511
00:24:05,311 --> 00:24:13,386
I LIKE QUIET GUYS.

512
00:24:05,311 --> 00:24:13,386
OR, ACTUALLY, GIRLS TOO.

513
00:24:13,386 --> 00:24:19,926
>> UNLESS MY BRAIN SHORT

514
00:24:13,386 --> 00:24:19,926
CIRCUITED, WE HAVE A MODERN

515
00:24:13,386 --> 00:24:19,926
WOMAN ON OUR HANDS.

516
00:24:19,926 --> 00:24:26,266
>> GOOD.

517
00:24:19,926 --> 00:24:26,266
THEN LET'S UP THE ROMANCE.

518
00:24:19,926 --> 00:24:26,266
ACT LIKE YOU'RE IN A MOVIE AND

519
00:24:26,266 --> 00:24:33,206
WIPE AN EYELASH FROM HER FACE.

520
00:24:26,266 --> 00:24:33,206
>> OKAY, BRILLIANT.

521
00:24:26,266 --> 00:24:33,206
STAND BY, PLEASE.

522
00:24:33,206 --> 00:24:36,609
OKAY, I DID IT.

00:24:33,206 --> 00:24:36,609
>> WELL, HOW DID IT GO?

524
00:24:33,206 --> 00:24:36,609
>> I DIDN'T TELL HER THAT'S WHAT

525
00:24:36,609 --> 00:24:44,150
I WAS DOING, SO I'M NOT SURE.

526
00:24:36,609 --> 00:24:44,150
>> DANG, I KNEW THE EYELASH WAS

527
00:24:36,609 --> 00:24:44,150
A TYPO.

528
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:49,823
>> CAN I PUT MY HEAD ON YOUR

529
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:49,823
SHOULDER?

530
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:49,823
>> SHOULDER.

531
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:12,245
>> CALL ATTENTION TO YOUR KNEE

532
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:12,245
SO SHE KNOW IT'S THERE.

533
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:12,245
NOW, IF SHE LIKED, SHE MAY TOUCH

534
00:25:12,245 --> 00:25:19,853
IT WITH HER OWN.

535
00:25:12,245 --> 00:25:19,853
>> OKAY, WE HAVE CONTACT.

536
00:25:12,245 --> 00:25:19,853
THE KNEE.

537
00:25:19,853 --> 00:25:27,227
WE ARE AFFIRMATIVE.

538
00:25:19,853 --> 00:25:27,227
PATELAU ON PATELAU AND I CAN

539
00:25:19,853 --> 00:25:27,227
FEEL MY PEN IN MY HEAD.

540
00:25:27,227 --> 00:25:33,066
>> THIS IS OFFICIALLY ABOVE MY

541
00:25:27,227 --> 00:25:33,066
PAY GRADE.

542
00:25:27,227 --> 00:25:33,066
>> YOU HAVE TO STAY WITH ME.

543
00:25:33,066 --> 00:25:44,310
THE STAKES ARE LIFE AND DEATH.

544
00:25:33,066 --> 00:25:44,310
>> WELL, CHECK FOR SHOULDER

545
00:25:33,066 --> 00:25:44,310
DEMEANOR.

546
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:46,079
STIFF OR LOOSE?

547
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:46,079
>> I'M CHECKING, REMAIN ON THE

548
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:46,079
LINE, PLEASE.

549
00:25:46,079 --> 00:25:50,450
OH, DEAR GOD, SHE'S MET MY GAZE.

550
00:25:46,079 --> 00:25:50,450
WE'RE LOOKING AT EACH OTHER,

551
00:25:46,079 --> 00:25:50,450
WE'RE SHARING BREATH, WE'RE

552
00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:58,091
BECOMING SOULMATES.

553
00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:58,091
AND YET, I FEEL AFRAID.

554
00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:58,091
NOT OF LOVE BUT OF LOSING YOU,

555
00:25:58,091 --> 00:26:06,900
>> NAY, SAVOR THIS, MY GOOD MAN.

556
00:25:58,091 --> 00:26:06,900
'TIS THE SPICE OF LIFE.

557
00:25:58,091 --> 00:26:06,900
>> HEY, CAN -- CAN WE KISS NOW?

558
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:15,542
>> YOU HEARD THE WOMAN.

559
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:15,542
I'LL SEE YOU ON THE OTHER SIDE.

560
00:26:21,544 --> 00:26:23,665
>>> YOU'RE WATCHING DISNEY MINUS,

561
00:26:23,665 --> 00:26:25,936
THE MOVIES DISNEY DOESN'T
PROMOTE AS MUCH.

562
00:26:25,936 --> 00:26:29,431
FROG

563
00:26:31,257 --> 00:26:35,217

00:26:42,406 --> 00:26:47,097
PRINCESS AND THE FROG *

567
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:50,904
>> I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M SAYING
THIS, BUT I THINK I'VE FALLEN IN
LOVE.

568
00:26:50,904 --> 00:26:52,408
WITH A FROG.

569
00:26:52,408 --> 00:26:57,225
>> I KNOW, IT'S CRAZY, RIGHT?
I'M LIKE THIS FROG, YOU'RE LIKE
THIS PRINCESS.

570
00:26:57,225 --> 00:27:00,762
BUT I GUESS IT'S TRUE WHAT THEY
SAY.
LOVE IS LOVE IS LOVE.

571
00:27:00,762 --> 00:27:04,688
I HOPE I'M NOT BEING TOO
FORWARD, TIANA, BUT WILL YOU
KISS ME?

572
00:27:04,688 --> 00:27:08,957
>> OF COURSE I WILL.
BECAUSE LOVE CONQUERS ALL.

573
00:27:08,957 --> 00:27:11,186
>> EXACTLY.
YOU LOVE ME FOR ME.

574
00:27:11,186 --> 00:27:15,631
YOU DON'T CARE THAT I'M A FROG
AND FROGS DON'T HAVE PENISES.

575
00:27:16,190 --> 00:27:18,216
>> WHAT WAS THAT?

576
00:27:18,216 --> 00:27:21,821
>> IT'S JUST A SCIENTIFIC FACT.
FROGS DON'T HAVE PENS.

577
00:27:21,821 --> 00:27:24,418
AND THAT'S WHY I LOVE YOU.

578
00:27:24,419 --> 00:27:27,615
SURE

579
00:27:27,615 --> 00:27:31,274
>> AND THAT'S JUST SOMETHING
EVERYBODY KNOWS?

580
00:27:31,274 --> 00:27:37,156
IT'S ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS
THAT COMES UP WHEN YOU GOOGLE
FROG PENIS.

581
00:27:37,156 --> 00:27:42,068
YOU KNOW WHAT LET'S JUST KISS
AND GET MARRIED AND WE'LL TACKLE
THE WHOLE NO PENIS THING LATER.

582
00:27:42,068 --> 00:27:46,188
>> SORRY.
JUST -- SO IF YOU DON'T HAVE A
PENIS, WHAT DO YOU HAVE?

583
00:27:46,277 --> 00:27:48,026
>> OH, IT'S EVERY WOMAN'S DREAM.

584
00:27:48,026 --> 00:27:51,276
I GOT BALLS THAT JUST SHOOT
STUFF DIRECTLY ON YOU.

585
00:27:51,276 --> 00:27:54,948
NO PESKY PENIS GETTING IN THE
WAY.

586
00:27:54,948 --> 00:27:56,925
>> OH, WOW.

587
00:27:57,026 --> 00:28:02,870
>> IT'S LIKE THEY ALWAYS SAY.
WHO NEEDS A STRAW WHEN I CAN
JUST THROW THE MILKSHAKE IN YOUR
FACE?

588
00:28:02,870 --> 00:28:05,364
HOW ABOUT THAT KISS?

589
00:28:05,554 --> 00:28:09,385
>> YEAH, YOU KNOW -- I MIGHT
HAVE TO RETHINK THIS A BIT.

590
00:28:09,385 --> 00:28:11,569
>> OH, COME ON.
SIZE DOESN'T MATTER.

591
00:28:11,569 --> 00:28:14,001
>> I THINK IT DOES WHEN IT'S
ZERO.

592
00:28:14,001 --> 00:28:18,146
HOW DO YOU EVEN HAVE SEX?
>> OH, I'LL EXPLAIN IN GREAT
DETAIL.

593
00:28:18,146 --> 00:28:22,737
YOU SEE, I CLIMB ON YOUR BACK
AND I WRAP MY FORELIMBS AROUND YOUR BODY,

594
00:28:22,737 --> 00:28:26,948
THEN I STAY THERE
ABOUT TWO DAYS AND CROAK LOUDLY
IN YOUR EAR UNTIL YOU LAY YOUR
EGGS.

595
00:28:26,948 --> 00:28:31,239
HOW MANY EGGS DO YOU TYPICALLY
LAY?
>> I DON'T LAY EGGS.

596
00:28:31,239 --> 00:28:33,162
>> OH, THAT COULD BE A DEAL
BREAKER.

597
00:28:33,162 --> 00:28:36,521
>> YOU KNOW THIS NEVER CAME UP
WHEN WE DISSECTED FROGS IN HIGH
SCHOOL.

598
00:28:36,521 --> 00:28:38,877
>> WHAT?

599
00:28:42,521 --> 00:28:44,767
WELL

600
00:28:44,767 --> 00:28:47,772
CURSED

601
00:28:47,772 --> 00:28:50,909
HOOK

00:28:50,909 --> 00:28:54,742
>> DR. FACILIER,

00:28:54,742 --> 00:28:57,513
THE VOODOO
WITCH DOCTOR FROM THIS MOVIE.

604
00:28:57,513 --> 00:29:02,279
>> SO, IF I KISS THIS FROG,
HE'LL TRANSFORM INTO A PRINCE?

605
00:29:02,279 --> 00:29:04,339
>> ONLY IF IT'S TRUE LOVE.

606
00:29:04,339 --> 00:29:05,990
>> UH-HUH?
UH-HUH?

607
00:29:05,990 --> 00:29:12,300
AND WHAT WOULD HAPPEN WITH
HIS -- PENIS?

608
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:13,348
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

609
00:29:13,348 --> 00:29:16,313
>> WELL, APPARENTLY FROGS DON'T
HAVE THEM.

610
00:29:16,313 --> 00:29:18,167
>> THE HELL?

611
00:29:18,733 --> 00:29:22,924
WELL, THEN, HOW DO THEY --
>> IT JUST SHOOTS UP THE NUTS.

612
00:29:22,924 --> 00:29:27,731
>> ON THE PLUS SIDE, I CAN DO
ORAL FROM LIKE FIVE FEET AWAY.

613
00:29:29,826 --> 00:29:36,084
>> WELL.
I GUESS IF HE CHANGED BACK TO
BEING A HUMAN, HE WOULD GET HIS
PENIS BACK.

614
00:29:36,084 --> 00:29:40,921
>> THEN LET'S DO IT!
LET'S KISS AND JOIN OUR SOULS
FOREVER!

615
00:29:40,921 --> 00:29:43,884
>> AND WHAT IF I DIDN'T HAVE A
PENIS BEFORE?

616
00:29:43,884 --> 00:29:45,522
>> WHAT?

617
00:29:45,522 --> 00:29:48,094
>> I MEAN, AS A HUMAN, BEFORE
THE CURSE.

618
00:29:48,094 --> 00:29:51,881
WHAT IF I, HYPOTHETICALLY, GOT
RIPPED CLEAN OFF AT A BOWLING
ALLEY?

619
00:29:51,881 --> 00:29:54,708
IF SHE KISSED, WOULD IT GROW
BACK?

620
00:29:54,708 --> 00:29:57,041
>> A BOWLING ALLEY?

621
00:29:57,041 --> 00:30:00,937
>> I TRIED TO HUMP THE BALL
RETURN MACHINE, AS A JOKE.

622
00:30:00,937 --> 00:30:03,456
CLEAN OFF.

623
00:30:03,456 --> 00:30:07,419
>> STOP SAYING CLEAN OFF.
>> IF YOU SAW IT, YOU'D AGREE.

624
00:30:07,419 --> 00:30:10,284
>> YOU ARE A WEIRD FROG, DUDE.

625
00:30:10,284 --> 00:30:15,506
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE HELL IS
GOING ON WITH YOU.
BUT AT LEAST YOU'RE A PRINCE.

626
00:30:15,506 --> 00:30:19,501
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
THE PRINCE OF NEWARK,
NEW JERSEY.

627
00:30:20,134 --> 00:30:22,027
>> OKAY.
I'M -- I'M OUT.

628
00:30:22,027 --> 00:30:25,153
>> YEAH, EVEN FOR VOODOO, THIS
IS MESSED UP.

629
00:30:32,462 --> 00:30:35,583
IT'S ABOUT TIME I INTRODUCED
MYSELF.

630
00:30:35,583 --> 00:30:39,636
MY NAME RAYMOND.
BUT EVERYBODY CALLS ME RAY.

631
00:30:39,636 --> 00:30:42,779
I'M THE CAJUN FIREFLY IN THE
MOVIE.
WHICH THAT'S WRONG.

632
00:30:42,779 --> 00:30:47,717
AND CRITICALLY, I MIGHT BE JUST
ABOUT THE WORST DISNEY CHARACTER

00:54:34,274 --> 00:54:43,917
THANKS, CHRIS.

1115
00:54:34,274 --> 00:54:43,917

1116
00:54:34,274 --> 00:54:43,917
>> ALL RIGHT.

1117
00:54:43,917 --> 00:54:45,919
CONTESTANTS, LET'S PULL UP OUR

1118
00:54:43,917 --> 00:54:45,919
FIRST WORD CRUNCH.

1119
00:54:43,917 --> 00:54:45,919
IF YOU SEE A WORD, JUST SHOUT IT

1120
00:54:45,919 --> 00:54:50,590
OUT.

1121
00:54:45,919 --> 00:54:50,590
AND YOUR TIME STARTS NOW.

1122
00:54:45,919 --> 00:54:50,590
>> OH, I SEE "HAPPY."

1123
00:54:50,590 --> 00:54:54,527
>> YOU GOT IT.

1124
00:54:50,590 --> 00:54:54,527
5 POINTS.

1125
00:54:50,590 --> 00:54:54,527
>> I SEE "CAT."

1126
00:54:54,527 --> 00:55:05,372
>> GREAT, THAT'S 3 POINTS.

1127
00:54:54,527 --> 00:55:05,372
>> I SEE "MOM HOLE."

1128
00:54:54,527 --> 00:55:05,372
>> NO, SORRY ABOUT THAT, CARA,

1129
00:55:05,372 --> 00:55:09,109
NO POINTS.

1130
00:55:05,372 --> 00:55:09,109
BUT THERE'S STILL TIME, KEEP

1131
00:55:05,372 --> 00:55:09,109
GUESSING.

1132
00:55:09,109 --> 00:55:19,452
>> "DOG."

1133
00:55:09,109 --> 00:55:19,452
>> NICE, 3 POINTS FOR DAVE.

1134
00:55:09,109 --> 00:55:19,452
>> OH, I'VE GOT ONE, "MOM HOLE."

1135
00:55:19,452 --> 00:55:25,658
>> YEAH, AGAIN, CARA, MAYBE STOP

1136
00:55:19,452 --> 00:55:25,658
GUESSING "MOM HOLE."

1137
00:55:19,452 --> 00:55:25,658
WE CANNOT ACCEPT "MOM HOLE."

1138
00:55:25,658 --> 00:55:28,428
>> WHY NOT?

1139
00:55:25,658 --> 00:55:28,428
>> WELL, IT'S A FEW REASONS.

1140
00:55:25,658 --> 00:55:28,428
FOR ONE, IT'S TWO WORDS.

1141
00:55:28,428 --> 00:55:31,765
YOU COULD DO "MOM," AND THEN

1142
00:55:28,428 --> 00:55:31,765
AFTER THAT, YOU COULD SAY

1143
00:55:28,428 --> 00:55:31,765
HOLE.

1144
00:55:31,765 --> 00:55:44,077
>> BUT I WANT TO CONNECT THEM.

1145
00:55:31,765 --> 00:55:44,077
>> WELL, YOU CAN'T.

1146
00:55:31,765 --> 00:55:44,077
PLEASE GUESS SOMETHING ELSE.

1147
00:55:44,077 --> 00:55:45,578
>> FINE.

1148
00:55:44,077 --> 00:55:45,578
>> THANK YOU.

1149
00:55:44,077 --> 00:55:45,578
>> OH, "MOM HOLE."

1150
00:55:45,578 --> 00:55:47,614
>> YES, OH, I TOLD YOU NOT TO

1151
00:55:45,578 --> 00:55:47,614
SAY THAT.

1152
00:55:45,578 --> 00:55:47,614
>> NO, NO, THE OTHER ONE.

1153
00:55:47,614 --> 00:55:50,817
>> WHY ARE THERE TWO?

1154
00:55:47,614 --> 00:55:50,817
>> I DON'T KNOW, GENE, THIS

1155
00:55:47,614 --> 00:55:50,817
ISN'T MY GAME.

1156
00:55:50,817 --> 00:55:54,087
>> OH, OH, I'VE GOT ONE.

1157
00:55:50,817 --> 00:55:54,087
I SEE "APPLE."

1158
00:55:50,817 --> 00:55:54,087
>> GREAT, 5 POINTS.

1159
00:55:54,087 --> 00:55:57,590
>> SO WAIT, LET ME GET THIS

1160
00:55:54,087 --> 00:55:57,590
STRAIGHT.

1161
00:55:54,087 --> 00:55:57,590
SHE SAYS "APPLE," WHICH IS

1162
00:55:57,590 --> 00:56:02,095
5 POINTS, AND YOU THINK THAT'S

1163
00:55:57,590 --> 00:56:02,095
COOL.

1164
00:55:57,590 --> 00:56:02,095
BUT THEN WHEN I SAY "MOM HOLE,"

1165
00:56:02,095 --> 00:56:07,167
WHICH IS 7, I GET NOTHING?

1166
00:56:02,095 --> 00:56:07,167
THAT DOESN'T SEEM FAIR.

1167
00:56:02,095 --> 00:56:07,167
>> WELL, APPLE IS A REAL THING,

1168
00:56:07,167 --> 00:56:21,848
SO --

1169
00:56:07,167 --> 00:56:21,848
>> SO IS MOM HOLE.

1170
00:56:07,167 --> 00:56:21,848
YOU MIGHT WANT TO THINK ABOUT

1171
00:56:21,848 --> 00:56:24,484
IT, BUT THEY'VE GOT THEM.

1172
00:56:21,848 --> 00:56:24,484
>> OH, I'VE GOT ANOTHER ONE.

1173
00:56:21,848 --> 00:56:24,484
POTHOLE.

1174
00:56:24,484 --> 00:56:27,053
>> OH, GREAT, 7 POINTS.

1175
00:56:24,484 --> 00:56:27,053
>> WHAT THE HELL?

1176
00:56:24,484 --> 00:56:27,053
>> CARA, CARA, RELAX.

1177
00:56:27,053 --> 00:56:28,588
>> OKAY, SO IF I HAD SAID

1178
00:56:27,053 --> 00:56:28,588
POTHOLE THAT WOULD HAVE

1179
00:56:27,053 --> 00:56:28,588
COUNTED?

1180
00:56:28,588 --> 00:56:29,823
>> YES.

1181
00:56:28,588 --> 00:56:29,823
>> OKAY, GREAT.

1182
00:56:28,588 --> 00:56:29,823
SO "MOM HOLE."

1183
00:56:29,823 --> 00:56:31,291
>> ALL RIGHT.

1184
00:56:29,823 --> 00:56:31,291
>> ALL RIGHT, I DON'T

1185
00:56:31,291 --> 00:56:34,227
UNDERSTAND.

1186
00:56:31,291 --> 00:56:34,227
>> YOU KNOW WHAT?

1187
00:56:31,291 --> 00:56:34,227
LET'S JUST GET A NEW PUZZLE UP

1188
00:56:34,227 --> 00:56:40,233
HERE.

1189
00:56:34,227 --> 00:56:40,233
>> AM I ALLOWED TO GUESS?

1190
00:56:34,227 --> 00:56:40,233
>> YES, AS LONG AS IT'S NOT "MOM

1191
00:56:40,233 --> 00:56:42,202
HOLE."

1192
00:56:40,233 --> 00:56:42,202
>> NO PROBLEM.

1193
00:56:40,233 --> 00:56:42,202
HIM HOLE.

1194
00:56:42,202 --> 00:56:45,171
>> NO.

1195
00:56:42,202 --> 00:56:45,171
>> "GAY HOLE."

1196
00:56:42,202 --> 00:56:45,171
>> WOW, THERE'S A FOUR ON THE

1197
00:56:45,171 --> 00:56:48,942
BOARD.

1198
00:56:45,171 --> 00:56:48,942
>> "JACKSON HOLE."

1199
00:56:45,171 --> 00:56:48,942
>> WHAT?

1200
00:56:48,942 --> 00:56:52,479
>> "HOLE FOODS."

1201
00:56:48,942 --> 00:56:52,479
MY HOLE.

1202
00:56:48,942 --> 00:56:52,479
>> OKAY.

1203
00:56:52,479 --> 00:57:02,489
>> "CORN HOLE."

1204
00:56:52,479 --> 00:57:02,489
>> COME ON!

1205
00:56:52,479 --> 00:57:02,489
>> AND "MMM HOLE."

1206
00:57:02,489 --> 00:57:04,357
>> OKAY, THAT IS NOT "MMM HOLE,"

1207
00:57:02,489 --> 00:57:04,357
THAT'S JUST THREE MS AND THEN

1208

1209

IF YOU SEE "HOLE" ON THE BOARD,

1220
00:57:34,454 --> 00:57:36,756
DON'T SAY "HOLE."

1221
