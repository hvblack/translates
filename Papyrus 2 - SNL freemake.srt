Yeah, I had
a rough couple of years.

-My something
was hard to explain.

in history,

And then it happened.

I came face-to-face
with my demons.

Just turn it off, please.

Okay, it's not
a huge improvement,
but it's -- it's not Papyrus.

00:01:36,894 --> 00:01:38,289
Somebody must have
said something.

So, yeah, again,
just to be clear,
not a huge improvement,

ushering in enlightenment
after enlightenment.
