1
00:00:01,641 --> 00:00:04,976
CHEERS IS FILMED BEFORE
A LIVE STUDIO AUDIENCE.

2
00:00:04,976 --> 00:00:10,494
OH, GEORGE! GEORGE!
GEORGE...

3
00:00:10,494 --> 00:00:11,815
ARE YOU REAL?

4
00:00:11,815 --> 00:00:14,790
HOT BUTTERED RUM
AND AN IRISH COFFEE.

5
00:00:15,183 --> 00:00:19,687
OH, NO.
NOT
IT'S A WONDERFUL
LIFE AGAIN.

6
00:00:19,687 --> 00:00:23,025
HOW MANY TIMES A DAY
ARE THEY GONNA SHOW
THIS GOLDEN MOLDY?

7
00:00:23,025 --> 00:00:28,647
SIX.
FROM NOW UNTIL NEW YEAR'S
ON CHANNEL 13,
IT'S A WONDERFUL MONTH.

8
00:00:29,163 --> 00:00:32,286
THIS FLICK'S SO
SWEET, IT MAKES
MY TEETH ACHE.

9
00:00:32,286 --> 00:00:35,203
UH-OH. STUPID ALERT.

10
00:00:35,203 --> 00:00:38,765
I CAN GUARANTEE YOU
FROM MY DAYS IN ACCOUNTING
IF YOU RUN SHORT
AT THE BANK,

11
00:00:38,765 --> 00:00:43,441
EVERYONE IN TOWN DOES NOT
DASH OVER, CASH IN HAND,
TO BAIL YOU OUT.

12
00:00:44,478 --> 00:00:46,992
HERE COMES THE
GUSHIEST PART.

13
00:00:46,992 --> 00:00:48,976
HAVE THEY NO SHAME?

14
00:00:48,976 --> 00:00:50,418
OH, YECCH, YECCH,
YECCH, YECCH.

15
00:00:50,418 --> 00:00:55,579
* FOR AULD LANG SYNE *

16
00:00:55,579 --> 00:01:00,991
* WE'LL DRINK A CUP
OF KINDNESS YET *

17
00:01:00,991 --> 00:01:07,346
* FOR AULD LANG SYNE **

18
00:01:07,346 --> 00:01:10,065
COULD I HAVE
A KLEENEX, SAM?

19
00:01:10,839 --> 00:01:13,705
I MUST HAVE GOTTEN
SOMETHING IN MY EYE.

20
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:16,587
YEAH, ME, TOO.

21
00:01:17,578 --> 00:01:20,380
MUST BE SOMETHING
IN THE AIR.

22
00:01:26,754 --> 00:01:29,379
* MAKING YOUR WAY
IN THE WORLD TODAY *

23
00:01:29,379 --> 00:01:32,326
* TAKES EVERYTHING
YOU'VE GOT *

24
00:01:32,326 --> 00:01:35,095

25
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:38,266

36
00:02:38,412 --> 00:02:41,634
GOOD AFTERNOON, ALL YOU
WARMHEARTED AND GENEROUS PEOPLE.

37
00:02:41,634 --> 00:02:43,737
CLIFFIE, WHAT'S
WITH THE BOX?

38
00:02:43,737 --> 00:02:46,130
WELL, THE POSTAL CARRIERS
ARE HAVING A FOOD DRIVE.

39
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:49,116
IF YOU GOOD SAMARITANS
FILL THIS BOX WITH CANNED GOODS,

40
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:52,607
I'LL WIN A FREE TRIP
TO DISNEY WORLD.

41
00:02:53,341 --> 00:02:58,047
IMAGINE THAT--
PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN,
MR. TOAD'S WILD RIDE,
AND ME.

42
00:02:58,109 --> 00:03:00,048
WHO ARE
THE CANS FOR?

43
00:03:00,048 --> 00:03:01,649
I DON'T KNOW.

44
00:03:01,649 --> 00:03:03,609
THE POOR, NEEDY--
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

45
00:03:03,685 --> 00:03:07,455
THEY MAKE SUCH A FUSS
ABOUT MOTHER THERESA.

46
00:03:07,455 --> 00:03:10,069
EXCUSE ME THERE, DOCTOR,
BUT DO I DETECT

47
00:03:10,069 --> 00:03:13,093
A WRY NOTE OF CYNICISM THERE
IN YOUR COMMENTS?

48
00:03:13,093 --> 00:03:14,662
CYNICAL, ME?

49
00:03:14,662 --> 00:03:17,542
HOW COULD I POSSIBLY
BE CYNICAL LIVING
IN A NATION

50
00:03:17,542 --> 00:03:20,668
IN WHICH WE CELEBRATE
THE HOLY BIRTH OF A BABE
IN A MANGER

51
00:03:20,668 --> 00:03:23,412
WITH PERRY COMO
IN HAWAII?

52
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:29,270
HEY, BOSS LADY,
WHAT ARE YOU ALL
DUDED UP FOR?

53
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:33,669
- YOU MEAN WHY AM I NOT
WEARING A SWEATSHIRT
AND PLASTIC EARRINGS?
- YEAH.

54
00:03:33,669 --> 00:03:36,917
BECAUSE I JUST CAME
FROM THE COMPANY
CHRISTMAS PARTY.

55
00:03:36,917 --> 00:03:40,254
DID YOU CORNER MR. DRAKE
UNDER THE MISTLETOE
AND MAKE NICE?

56
00:03:40,254 --> 00:03:41,672
NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS.

57
00:03:41,672 --> 00:03:45,830
* OH, REBECCA DIDN'T GET
HER CHRISTMAS GOOSE **

58
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:50,431
BUT I DID HAVE PLENTY
OF TIME TO MAKE OUT
NEXT WEEK'S SCHEDULE.

59
00:03:50,431 --> 00:03:55,040
WHOA.
WAIT A SECOND HERE.
YOU GOT US WORKING
ON CHRISTMAS EVE.
THAT'S A HOLIDAY.

60
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,154
NO. CHRISTMAS
IS A HOLIDAY.

61
00:03:57,154 --> 00:03:59,869
WELL, IT'S
A HOLIDAY EVE.

62
00:03:59,957 --> 00:04:02,569
I'M GONNA PAY YOU ALL
TIME-AND-A-HALF.

63
00:04:02,569 --> 00:04:05,746
NO. HEY, FORGET IT.
WE CANNOT BE BOUGHT.

64
00:04:05,746 --> 00:04:07,192
I CAN.

65
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:11,026
SWEETHEART,
DON'T YOU WANT TO BE HOME
WITH YOUR FAMILY?

66
00:04:11,026 --> 00:04:12,681
WOULD YOU?

67
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:15,164
GOOD POINT, GOOD POINT.

68
00:04:15,164 --> 00:04:17,736
UH, WOODY!
UH, WOODY CAN'T WORK.

69
00:04:17,736 --> 00:04:19,600
HE HAS TO GO BACK HOME
TO INDIANA AND BE
WITH HIS FOLKS.

70
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,580
NOT THIS YEAR, SAM.
I'M A BIG BOY NOW.

71
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:24,501
I GOT
COMMITMENTS IN THE CITY.

72
00:04:24,523 --> 00:04:28,602
I LANDED A PART
IN OUR CHILDREN'S THEATER
PRODUCTION OF THE STORY OF SNOW.

73
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:31,288
I PLAY THE KING
OF THE FLAKES.

74
00:04:32,005 --> 00:04:34,674
THAT WILL BE
A STRETCH.

75
00:04:35,848 --> 00:04:37,865
WE ONLY HAVE A MATINEE
ON CHRISTMAS EVE,

76
00:04:37,865 --> 00:04:41,214
SO I'D BE HAPPY TO
WORK THAT NIGHT,
ENCORES PERMITTING.

77
00:04:41,214 --> 00:04:45,484
GREAT.
JUST SO YOU GUYS KNOW
I'M NOT PULLING RANK,
I'M SCHEDULED TO WORK
THAT NIGHT TOO.

78
00:04:45,484 --> 00:04:48,304
NO, WAIT. LISTEN.
NO WAY AM I
PUNCHING THE CLOCK

79
00:04:48,304 --> 00:04:50,908
ON ONE OF THE MOST
SACRED AND FAMILY NIGHTS
OF THE WHOLE YEAR.

80
00:04:50,908 --> 00:04:52,693
WHAT DO YOU
HAVE PLANNED,

81
00:04:52,693 --> 00:04:56,729
AN INTIMATE LITTLE
DINNER WITH ONE
OF YOUR NIECES?

82
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:01,950
SHE MAKES IT SOUND
SO CHEAP.

83
00:05:08,776 --> 00:05:12,024
OH, JOY.
CHRISTMAS EVE.

84
00:05:12,024 --> 00:05:14,950
BY THIS TIME TOMORROW
MILLIONS OF AMERICANS,

85
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:17,794
KNEE-DEEP
IN TINSEL AND WRAPPING PAPER,

86
00:05:17,794 --> 00:05:22,093
WILL HAVE UTTERED
THOSE HEARTFELT WORDS,
"IS THIS ALL I GOT?"

87
00:05:24,068 --> 00:05:26,864
I HOPE YOU'RE NOT
HANGING THAT THERE
FOR MY BENEFIT.

88
00:05:26,864 --> 00:05:32,065
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
WHO'D WANT TO KISS SOMEBODY
WHO'D MAKE THEM WORK ON
CHRISTMAS EVE?

89
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:34,662
OH, ALL RIGHT.

90
00:05:36,434 --> 00:05:40,170
THE REVIEWS ARE IN.
WE'RE A HIT!

91
00:05:41,025 --> 00:05:44,128
LET'S TAKE A PEEK.

92
00:05:44,878 --> 00:05:49,183
OK.
"THE STORY OF SNOW
WAS WAY EXCELLENT.

93
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:53,336
"I THINK ANY KID IN
MISS PODESTA'S CLASS

94
00:05:53,336 --> 00:05:56,524
WHO MISSES IT
IS A FULL-ON GOON."

95
00:05:56,524 --> 00:06:00,470
AND THAT FROM THE KID
WHO PANNED GOLDILOCKS.

96
00:06:00,528 --> 00:06:04,122
I'M GONNA CALL MY MOM
AND READ IT TO HER.

97
00:06:04,122 --> 00:06:08,168
I SURE AM GLAD I STAYED
IN BOSTON AFTER ALL.

98
00:06:08,168 --> 00:06:11,754
IF I WAS HOME RIGHT NOW,
I'D JUST BE SITTING AROUND
LISTENING TO
MY AUNT AND UNCLE

99
00:06:11,754 --> 00:06:17,578
TALK ABOUT WHO'S DEAD
AND WHO'S SICK
AND WHO LOST PART OF THEIR HAND
IN THE THRESHER.

100
00:06:19,447 --> 00:06:21,582
HELLO, MOM?

101
00:06:21,582 --> 00:06:24,498
I MISS YOU ALL SO MUCH.

102
00:06:28,255 --> 00:06:30,491
LOOK AT
THE POOR SLOB,

103
00:06:30,491 --> 00:06:33,749
FORCED TO
HUMILIATE HIMSELF
IN SOME STUPID OUTFIT

104
00:06:33,749 --> 00:06:36,163
JUST TO
MAKE A FEW BUCKS
FOR THE
HOLIDAY SEASON.

105
00:06:36,163 --> 00:06:39,567
WHY DOESN'T HE JUST
WEAR A SIGN,
"LOSER FOR HIRE"?

106
00:06:39,567 --> 00:06:42,723
HEY, PETERSON.
YOU'RE LATE AGAIN.

107
00:06:42,723 --> 00:06:44,937
I'M NOT COVERING
FOR YOU THIS TIME.

108
00:06:44,937 --> 00:06:47,040
I THINK YOU HAVE
THE WRONG PETERSON.

109
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:52,755
OH, YEAH? WHEN YOU FIND
THE RIGHT ONE,
TELL HIM NOT TO SWEAT
IN THE HAT SO MUCH.

110
00:06:57,124 --> 00:07:00,560
WELL, I GUESS
I'M BUSTED.

111
00:07:00,954 --> 00:07:03,770
OK, I DIDN'T MENTION
ANYTHING TO YOU GUYS BECAUSE I

112
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:07,499
THOUGHT YOU GUYS
JUST MIGHT RAZZ ME
A LITTLE BIT

113
00:07:07,499 --> 00:07:10,598
ABOUT BEING
A SANTA CLAUS
OVER AT NAGELS.

114
00:07:10,598 --> 00:07:12,437
THAT WAS YOU?

115
00:07:12,437 --> 00:07:14,485
THAT'S WHAT
MY KID MEANT
WHEN SHE SAID

116
00:07:14,485 --> 00:07:18,623
SANTA SMELLS
LIKE THE PLACE
WHERE MOMMY WORKS.

117
00:07:27,047 --> 00:07:31,040
ARE YOU MAKING
THE STUFFING BONE-DRY
THE WAY I LOVE IT?

118
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:36,645
CAN'T YOU FREEZE SOME
AND MAIL IT TO ME?

119
00:07:36,645 --> 00:07:40,318
NO, NOT THE GRAVY.
THAT WOULD BE STUPID.

120
00:07:40,628 --> 00:07:42,639
MY MOTHER.

121
00:07:46,867 --> 00:07:50,617
OH, GOD. CAN YOU
BELIEVE REBECCA?

122
00:07:50,617 --> 00:07:53,471
AS LONG AS ONE
CUSTOMER STAYS,
WE ALL STAY.

123
00:07:53,471 --> 00:07:56,414
IT'S 10:30. THE GUY'S BEEN
NURSING THE SAME DRINK
FOR OVER AN HOUR.

124
00:07:56,414 --> 00:08:00,368
YEAH, I WISH HE'D HURRY
THE HELL UP SO WE COULD
GET OUT OF HERE.

125
00:08:00,368 --> 00:08:04,451
THE PRESENTS
ARE ALL WRAPPED,
ALL THE KIDS
ARE IN BED,

126
00:08:04,451 --> 00:08:08,299
AND EDDIE'S
WAITING UP FOR ME
SO THAT WE CAN
EXCHANGE OUR GOODIES
IN PRIVATE.

127
00:08:08,299 --> 00:08:10,917
YOU DON'T WAIT UNTIL
CHRISTMAS MORNING TO
OPEN YOUR PRESENTS?

128
00:08:10,917 --> 00:08:14,583
YEAH, BUT WE LIKE TO
EXCHANGE OUR GOODIES
IN PRIVATE.

129
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:19,853
HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT?
LET'S YOU, ME, AND WOODY
EXCHANGE PRESENTS
RIGHT NOW.

130
00:08:19,853 --> 00:08:22,784
AND WHEN HE LEAVES,
WE CAN LEAVE.
GOOD IDEA.

131
00:08:22,784 --> 00:08:25,338
DAD REPAIRED
THE WISE MEN?

132
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:27,657
IS BALTHAZAR
STILL BLACK?

133
00:08:27,657 --> 00:08:31,273
WOODY, SOON AS YOU FINISH,
WE'RE GONNA EXCHANGE
PRESENTS.

134
00:08:31,273 --> 00:08:34,147
OK, MOM,
GOT TO GO.
LOVE YOU. BYE.

135
00:08:36,517 --> 00:08:39,131
HERE YOU GO, SAM.
HERE, CARLA.

136
00:08:39,131 --> 00:08:40,985
OH, NO. WAIT.
THAT'S MISS HOWE'S.

137
00:08:40,985 --> 00:08:44,225
YOU...YOU GOT SOMETHING
FOR REBECCA?

138
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:47,961
WELL, IT'S
NOTHING SPECIAL.
JUST AN ANTIQUE
SILVER FRAME

139
00:08:47,961 --> 00:08:51,880
WITH A SILHOUETTE
OF HER FACE
THAT I CUT OUT
IN BLACK VELVET.

140
00:08:52,376 --> 00:08:53,851
WOW!

141
00:08:53,851 --> 00:08:57,533
I'M GLAD YOU LIKE IT
'CAUSE I GOT YOU
THE SAME THING.

142
00:08:57,533 --> 00:09:00,061
WELL, IT'S YOUR FACE.

143
00:09:00,441 --> 00:09:03,193
YEAH, I BETTER GIVE HER
MY PRESENT NOW, TOO.

144
00:09:03,193 --> 00:09:04,952
YOU GAVE
REBECCA A PRESENT?

145
00:09:04,952 --> 00:09:07,514
YOU DON'T
EVEN LIKE HER.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

146
00:09:07,514 --> 00:09:11,468
IT'S A CHRISTMAS
TRADITION, SAM.
IT'S CALLED KISSING UP.

147
00:09:14,287 --> 00:09:18,176
YEAH, I'D SURE FEEL
LIKE A DOOFUS
IF I DIDN'T
GET ANYTHING
FOR MISS HOWE

148
00:09:18,176 --> 00:09:20,632
WHEN SHE GOT
ALL THOSE WONDERFUL
PRESENTS FOR US.

149
00:09:20,632 --> 00:09:22,880
OH, MAN!

150
00:09:23,531 --> 00:09:25,259
I DIDN'T
GET HER ANYTHING.

151
00:09:25,259 --> 00:09:29,637
DON'T FEEL BAD, SAM,
JUST BECAUSE
EVERYBODY ELSE
GOT HER SOMETHING--

152
00:09:29,637 --> 00:09:31,965
THE PRETZEL SALESMAN,
THE BEER DISTRIBUTOR,

153
00:09:31,965 --> 00:09:34,964
THE RELIEF BARTENDER,
THAT GUY SHE FIRED
AFTER ONE DAY.

154
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:39,197
WAIT A MINUTE.
ALL THOSE GUYS
ARE JUST TRYING TO
GET HER IN THE SACK.

155
00:09:39,197 --> 00:09:42,564
I GOT SOME
SHOPPING TO DO.

156
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:48,746
ALL RIGHT,
HAPPY NEW YEAR,

157
00:09:48,746 --> 00:09:52,160
MERRY CHRISTMAS,
HAPPY CHANUKAH.
NOW GET LOST.

158
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,709
- I CAN'T!
- WHY NOT?

159
00:09:54,709 --> 00:09:58,114
- I'M EXPECTING FRIENDS.
- OH, YEAH. RIGHT.

160
00:09:58,114 --> 00:10:01,604
HI!
MERRY CHRISTMAS!

161
00:10:27,094 --> 00:10:31,049
BUON NATALE, FELIZ NAVIDAD,
JOYEUX NOEL,

162
00:10:31,049 --> 00:10:34,301
MERRY CHRISTMAS,
AND SHALOM.

163
00:10:34,301 --> 00:10:38,288
NOW GO HOME
AND TAKE 10
OF THESE DEADBEATS
WITH YOU.

164
00:10:38,288 --> 00:10:40,191
WOULD THAT I COULD, CARLA,

165
00:10:40,191 --> 00:10:43,365
BUT LADY BOUNTIFUL HERE
INSISTS ON DOLING OUT
THESE OBLIGATORY GIFTS

166
00:10:43,431 --> 00:10:46,413
SO PEOPLE WILL PRETEND
THEY LIKE US IN THE NEW YEAR.

167
00:10:46,413 --> 00:10:48,188
MY LITTLE SCROOGE.

168
00:10:48,188 --> 00:10:51,254
IF HE DOESN'T CHEER UP,
SANTA'S GONNA GIVE HIM
A LUMP OF COAL

169
00:10:51,254 --> 00:10:53,841
AND MAKE HIM SLEEP
ON THE COUCH.

170
00:10:53,954 --> 00:10:56,523
MERRY, MERRY,
HAPPY, HAPPY.

171
00:10:56,523 --> 00:10:59,727
WHERE'S SAM? I'VE GOT
A LITTLE SOMETHING
FOR HIM.

172
00:10:59,727 --> 00:11:01,795
HE WENT
TO BUY A GIFT
FOR MISS HOWE.

173
00:11:01,795 --> 00:11:03,296
TOO BAD HE
DIDN'T WAIT
AROUND.

174
00:11:03,296 --> 00:11:05,032
HE COULD'VE JUST
GIVEN HER THIS.

175
00:11:05,032 --> 00:11:07,434
I DON'T THINK SO.
THAT'S MENTHOLATED
PRESHAVE

176
00:11:07,434 --> 00:11:08,802
FOR TOUGH BEARDS.

177
00:11:08,802 --> 00:11:10,871
OH.
JUST AS WELL.

178
00:11:10,871 --> 00:11:12,672
THAT'S WHAT I
GOT HIM.

179
00:11:15,042 --> 00:11:17,477
HE DID IT AGAIN,
DAMN IT!

180
00:11:17,477 --> 00:11:19,379
THE THIRD YEAR IN A ROW
WALT TWITCHELL HAS CHEATED ME

181
00:11:19,379 --> 00:11:21,749
OUT OF MY RIGHTFUL PLACE
IN THE MAGIC KINGDOM

182
00:11:21,749 --> 00:11:26,086
AND HE DID IT BY
ONE LOUSY DENTED CAN OF SPAM.

183
00:11:26,086 --> 00:11:29,289
CLAVIN, I KNOW
YOU'RE DYING
TO GO A PLACE

184
00:11:29,289 --> 00:11:30,824
WHERE NO ONE LOOKS TWICE

185
00:11:30,824 --> 00:11:33,727
AT FUNNY COSTUMES
AND BIG, FLOPPY EARS,

186
00:11:33,727 --> 00:11:35,662
BUT I THINK YOU
MISSED THE POINT HERE.

187
00:11:35,662 --> 00:11:37,297
A LOT OF FOOD
GOT TO NEEDY PEOPLE.

188
00:11:37,297 --> 00:11:39,733
ISN'T THAT
WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT?

189
00:11:39,733 --> 00:11:41,802
WELL...

190
00:11:41,802 --> 00:11:44,571
I GUESS YOU'RE
RIGHT, CARLA.

191
00:11:44,571 --> 00:11:47,908
MR. CLAVIN,
I'M GLAD YOU'RE HERE.
I GOT SOMETHING FOR YOU.

192
00:11:47,908 --> 00:11:50,310
OH, THANKS,
WOODY, BUT...

193
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:52,412
WAIT A MINUTE.

194
00:11:52,412 --> 00:11:54,815
CHOW MEIN
AND LITCHI NUTS?

195
00:11:54,815 --> 00:11:56,216
WOODROW, THINK
VERY CAREFULLY.

196
00:11:56,216 --> 00:11:59,119
WERE THESE IN THE BAR
BEFORE 4 P.M. TODAY?

197
00:11:59,119 --> 00:12:02,022
YEAH. THEY WERE HERE.
I JUST FORGOT TO PUT
THEM IN THE BOX.

198
00:12:02,022 --> 00:12:05,025
OH, THAT MAKES
ONE MORE CAN
THAN TWITCHELL.

199
00:12:05,025 --> 00:12:06,693
I WIN!

200
00:12:06,693 --> 00:12:08,561
DECK THE HALLS
WITH SUNTAN LOTION.

201
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:11,398
DISNEY WORLD,
HERE I COME!

202
00:12:11,398 --> 00:12:15,068
WELL, I GUESS IT'S TRUE
WHAT THEY SAY--

203
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:17,437
CHARITY BEGINS
IN ORLANDO.

204
00:12:23,443 --> 00:12:26,279
OH, YOO-HOO!

205
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:27,414
HEY, WAIT! NO!

206
00:12:27,414 --> 00:12:28,381
I SEE YOU IN THERE!

207
00:12:28,381 --> 00:12:31,218
HEY, COME--
PLEASE! OH, PLEASE OPEN!

208
00:12:31,218 --> 00:12:33,120
AW!

209
00:12:36,023 --> 00:12:36,924
HEY!

210
00:12:36,924 --> 00:12:39,326
PLEASE OPEN UP!

211
00:12:39,326 --> 00:12:40,627
EXCUSE--

212
00:12:40,627 --> 00:12:42,229
OH, GREAT, LISTEN, UH...

213
00:12:42,229 --> 00:12:45,866
IS THERE ANY STORE
OPEN AROUND HERE
THIS TIME OF NIGHT?

214
00:12:45,866 --> 00:12:48,201
OH, GEEZ.

215
00:12:48,201 --> 00:12:49,269
OHH!

216
00:12:51,371 --> 00:12:52,339
OH, BLESS YOU, SIR.

217
00:12:52,339 --> 00:12:54,374
THANK YOU. THANK YOU
FOR BEING OPEN.

218
00:12:54,374 --> 00:12:56,343
SORRY. CLOSED.

219
00:12:56,343 --> 00:12:57,878
OHH!

220
00:12:57,878 --> 00:12:59,847
MERRY CHRISTMAS.

221
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:15,362
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

222
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:21,835
NO...NO.
I'M TRYING TO GET
A GIFT FOR MY BOSS,

223
00:13:21,835 --> 00:13:23,203
EVERYTHING'S CLOSED,

224
00:13:23,203 --> 00:13:26,106
I'M COLD, IT'S WET,
AND I'M MISERABLE.

225
00:13:26,106 --> 00:13:27,707
I'VE GOT
PLENTY OF PRESENTS HERE.

226
00:13:27,707 --> 00:13:29,843
MAYBE YOU CAN USE
ONE OF THESE.

227
00:13:35,582 --> 00:13:38,518
WHAT? YOU MUST
BE AN ANGEL.

228
00:13:38,518 --> 00:13:40,787
YOU DON'T HAVE WINGS
UNDER THERE, DO YOU?

229
00:13:40,787 --> 00:13:42,155
MM-HMM.

230
00:13:42,155 --> 00:13:43,723
WHAT?

231
00:13:43,723 --> 00:13:45,725
I'M A STEWARDESS.

232
00:13:45,725 --> 00:13:48,061
OH, OH, GOD!

233
00:13:48,061 --> 00:13:49,963
OH, BLESS YOUR HEART!

234
00:13:49,963 --> 00:13:52,966
WELL, LET'S SEE
WHAT I'VE GOT.

235
00:13:52,966 --> 00:13:54,467
OH, THANK YOU.
OK.

236
00:13:54,467 --> 00:13:56,904
AH, WELL, WHAT'S
THIS ONE RIGHT HERE?

237
00:13:56,904 --> 00:13:58,138
THOSE ARE EAR MUFFS.

238
00:13:58,138 --> 00:13:59,973
YOU DON'T WANT THOSE.

239
00:13:59,973 --> 00:14:01,641
THEY'RE TOO IMPERSONAL
AND BORING.

240
00:14:01,641 --> 00:14:04,544
THEY'D BE PERFECT
FOR HER.

241
00:14:04,544 --> 00:14:05,845
YOUR BOSS IS A HER?

242
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:08,648
YEAH. WELL,
RUMOR HAS IT.

243
00:14:08,648 --> 00:14:11,952
I'VE GOT SOME THINGS I BOUGHT
FOR MYSELF SHE MIGHT LIKE.

244
00:14:11,952 --> 00:14:14,321
NO,
THE EAR MUFFS
ARE PERFECT.

245
00:14:14,321 --> 00:14:15,322
LET ME JUST
WRITE YOU OUT
A CHECK HERE.

246
00:14:15,322 --> 00:14:19,492
HOW ABOUT
A NICE SILK TEDDY?

247
00:14:19,492 --> 00:14:22,662
I LOVE TO LOUNGE
AROUND IN MY HOUSE WITH THIS.

248
00:14:22,662 --> 00:14:24,297
OH, YEAH?

249
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:28,969
WHAT ELSE DID YOU BUY
FOR YOURSELF IN THERE?

250
00:14:28,969 --> 00:14:31,104
A BLACK LACE
GARTER BELT.

251
00:14:31,104 --> 00:14:33,540
TRUST ME. YOU CAN
NEVER HAVE TOO MANY
OF THESE.

252
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:34,874
MMM.

253
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:38,111
MM-HMM. LET'S SEE.
WE HAVE BABY DOLLS

254
00:14:38,111 --> 00:14:40,647
AND A SHORT KIMONO...

255
00:14:40,647 --> 00:14:42,149
MERRY CHRISTMAS, SAMMY.

256
00:14:42,149 --> 00:14:45,085
AND SATIN CAMISOLE.

257
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:52,025
EVENING, EVERYBODY.

258
00:14:52,025 --> 00:14:54,694
NORM!
NORM!
NORM!

259
00:14:54,694 --> 00:14:56,296
SANTA, WHAT
CAN I GET YOU?

260
00:14:56,296 --> 00:15:00,067
FINALLY, SOMEONE WANTS
TO GET ME SOMETHING.

261
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:06,906
I AM SO HAPPY
THIS HOLIDAY SEASON
IS OVER WITH.

262
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:09,309
THE WHINING, THE CRYING,

263
00:15:09,309 --> 00:15:12,345
THE SCREAMING,
THE TEMPER TANTRUMS...

264
00:15:12,345 --> 00:15:14,982
OK, I WASN'T
YOUR TRADITIONAL SANTA CLAUS.

265
00:15:21,488 --> 00:15:23,190
RIGHT OVER THERE.

266
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:25,058
I'LL GET YOU SOME BEERS
I'LL BE RIGHT WITH YOU.

267
00:15:25,058 --> 00:15:27,660
WHAT'S WITH ALL THE BOWLS
FULL OF JELLY?

268
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:30,097
JUST HAVING A LITTLE
GET TOGETHER
AFTER WORK,

269
00:15:30,097 --> 00:15:32,365
KIND OF A CLASS REUNION.

270
00:15:32,365 --> 00:15:34,601
WOW.
YOU GUYS ALL WENT
TO THE SAME SCHOOL?

271
00:15:34,601 --> 00:15:35,969
SANTA SCHOOL.

272
00:15:35,969 --> 00:15:37,670
IT COVERED ALL THE BASICS--

273
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:39,272
THE HAIR, THE MAKE-UP,

274
00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:42,175
HOW TO TALK KIDS INTO
ASKING FOR BIG-TICKET ITEMS.

275
00:15:45,312 --> 00:15:47,947
HO HO!
LOOK WHO'S HERE.

276
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:51,318
OH, NO! WHAT IF
A LITTLE KID WALKS IN HERE?

277
00:15:51,318 --> 00:15:54,354
SWEETHEART,
IT'S ALMOST MIDNIGHT
CHRISTMAS EVE.

278
00:15:54,354 --> 00:15:58,125
WHAT A TIME
TO FIND OUT.

279
00:15:58,125 --> 00:16:00,327
WHY DON'T YOU
GRAB A SEAT RIGHT HERE,

280
00:16:00,327 --> 00:16:02,829
AND I'LL GO GET US SOMETHING
HOT FOR OUR TODDIES.

281
00:16:02,829 --> 00:16:04,564
THANKS, SAM.

282
00:16:06,599 --> 00:16:09,869
HEY, CARLA,
I GOT A PRESENT
FOR REBECCA.

283
00:16:09,869 --> 00:16:12,605
I SEE YOU PICKED UP
A LITTLE PACKAGE
FOR YOURSELF, TOO.

284
00:16:12,605 --> 00:16:16,009
HEY, WHY NOT?
I'VE BEEN A GOOD BOY.

285
00:16:16,009 --> 00:16:17,710
IT'S WHAT I ASKED FOR.

286
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:22,415
SAM, PLEASE ACCEPT
THIS MERRY CHRISTMAS
FROM FRASIER AND ME.

287
00:16:22,415 --> 00:16:25,385
OH! HEY, WOW!
THAT'S GREAT.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

288
00:16:25,385 --> 00:16:27,320
LISTEN,
I GOT YOU SOMETHING, TOO.

289
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:30,823
I LEFT IT OVER AT, UH,
MY OTHER APARTMENT.

290
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:33,060
CAN I GET IT FOR YOU
NEXT WEEK?

291
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:34,461
OF COURSE,
WHATEVER YOU LIKE, SAM.

292
00:16:34,461 --> 00:16:37,264
OR WHENEVER YOU GET
A CHANCE TO BUY IT.

293
00:16:39,266 --> 00:16:44,237
IGNORE HIM, SAM.
HE HAS A BUG UP
HIS CHIMNEY.

294
00:16:44,237 --> 00:16:45,672
MERRY CHRISTMAS!

295
00:16:45,672 --> 00:16:47,107
MERRY CHRISTMAS!

296
00:16:47,107 --> 00:16:48,308
LET ME HAVE
THE EAR MUFFS.

297
00:16:48,308 --> 00:16:49,576
THAT'S MY BOSS HERE.

298
00:16:49,576 --> 00:16:51,711
WOODY,
CARLA, SAM.

299
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:54,013
THESE ARE JUST
LITTLE TOKENS
OF APPRECIATION

300
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:56,416
FROM ME TO YOU.

301
00:16:56,416 --> 00:16:58,651
OH, MY!
YOU GOT US
PRESENTS!

302
00:16:58,651 --> 00:17:00,353
OH, WOW!

303
00:17:00,353 --> 00:17:01,788
THERE WERE
SO MANY CHOICES,

304
00:17:01,788 --> 00:17:04,391
BUT I THINK
I DONE GOOD.

305
00:17:04,391 --> 00:17:07,260
A COFFEE MUG
WITH THE CORPORATE LOGO.

306
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:09,896
A NIGHTSHIRT
WITH THE CORPORATE LOGO.

307
00:17:09,896 --> 00:17:11,964
THANKS.
THANKS.
THANKS.

308
00:17:11,964 --> 00:17:13,333
YOU'RE WELCOME,

309
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:16,136
AND I DON'T
EXPECT ANYTHING
IN RETURN.

310
00:17:16,136 --> 00:17:17,870
OH, WE GOT YOU GIFTS.

311
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:19,372
YAY!

312
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:23,176
WHY DON'T YOU
OPEN MINE FIRST?

313
00:17:23,176 --> 00:17:24,544
"TO REBECCA FROM SAM."

314
00:17:24,544 --> 00:17:26,313
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE
GONE TO THE TROUBLE.

315
00:17:26,313 --> 00:17:28,515
JUST A LITTLE
SOMETHING TO KEEP
YOUR EARS WARM.

316
00:17:28,515 --> 00:17:31,784
OH, MY GOD!

317
00:17:31,784 --> 00:17:33,886
DIAMOND EARRINGS!

318
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:36,123
I DON'T BELIEVE THIS!

319
00:17:39,692 --> 00:17:41,294
I DON'T EITHER.

320
00:17:42,162 --> 00:17:43,463
I THOUGHT
I WAS A KISS-UP,

321
00:17:43,463 --> 00:17:46,233
BUT SAMMY WINS
THE PUCKER SWEEPSTAKES.

322
00:17:46,233 --> 00:17:48,701
HEY, IF HE GOT HER DIAMONDS,
I WONDER WHAT HE GOT US!

323
00:17:48,701 --> 00:17:50,870
YEAH!

324
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:52,705
AW, BIG WHOOP,
A WALLET.

325
00:17:54,141 --> 00:17:56,843
THANKS FOR
THE SOAP, SAM.

326
00:17:56,843 --> 00:18:00,547
OOH, AND
IT'S PINK, TOO.

327
00:18:00,547 --> 00:18:02,415
LISTEN, I'M SORRY
ABOUT THE MIX-UP HERE,

328
00:18:02,415 --> 00:18:04,517
BUT MY BOSS SEEMS
TO REALLY LOVE
THE DIAMOND EARRINGS.

329
00:18:04,517 --> 00:18:08,087
CAN I BUY THEM FROM YOU,
MAYBE?

330
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:09,522
THEY WERE FOR MY MOTHER.
THEY COST $500.

331
00:18:09,522 --> 00:18:13,160
$500? I'LL BE RIGHT
BACK. REBECCA?

332
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:15,895
SAM, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO SAY.

333
00:18:15,895 --> 00:18:18,598
I'M REALLY OVERWHELMED
BY YOUR GENEROUS GIFT,

334
00:18:18,598 --> 00:18:21,033
BUT I THINK
IT'S INAPPROPRIATE.

335
00:18:21,033 --> 00:18:24,604
YOU MEAN,
YOU'RE GIVING IT BACK?

336
00:18:24,604 --> 00:18:27,174
YOU DON'T
WANT TO KEEP IT?

337
00:18:27,174 --> 00:18:28,608
I THINK I SHOULD.

338
00:18:28,608 --> 00:18:30,577
OH, WELL...
IF THAT'S THE WAY YOU FEEL,

339
00:18:30,577 --> 00:18:33,513
BUT I WANT YOU TO KNOW
I WOULDN'T HAVE BOUGHT
THESE FOR YOU

340
00:18:33,513 --> 00:18:35,748
UNLESS I WANTED YOU
TO HAVE THEM.

341
00:18:35,748 --> 00:18:38,718
WELL, THEY
ARE PRETTY.

342
00:18:42,088 --> 00:18:43,490
THANK YOU.

343
00:18:45,892 --> 00:18:48,695
IS THAT THANK YOU YOU'RE
GIVING THEM BACK TO ME

344
00:18:48,695 --> 00:18:51,231
OR THANK YOU
YOU'LL KEEP THEM?

345
00:18:51,231 --> 00:18:53,833
I'M AFRAID THAT
I'VE MISJUDGED YOU.

346
00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:55,402
YOU'RE VERY SWEET.

347
00:18:57,404 --> 00:18:59,239
WOULD YOU LIKE
TO COME OVER
MY HOUSE TONIGHT

348
00:18:59,239 --> 00:19:01,408
FOR A LATE SUPPER?

349
00:19:01,408 --> 00:19:04,211
WELL, THAT SOUNDS
VERY INVITING.

350
00:19:04,211 --> 00:19:06,713
AND I'LL WEAR
MY NEW EARRINGS.

351
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:10,583
AND VERY LITTLE ELSE.

352
00:19:14,754 --> 00:19:18,358
DAMN! THAT WITCH IS
GONNA MAKE ME WORK
TONIGHT.

353
00:19:18,358 --> 00:19:19,626
AFTER I GAVE HER
THE EARRINGS, TOO.

354
00:19:19,626 --> 00:19:21,261
I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

355
00:19:21,261 --> 00:19:25,131
OH. GUESS THAT MEANS
THERE'S NO LINGERIE
FASHION SHOW THEN?

356
00:19:25,131 --> 00:19:27,967
WELL, MAYBE WE COULD
DO IT SOME OTHER TIME.

357
00:19:27,967 --> 00:19:29,068
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

358
00:19:29,068 --> 00:19:30,537
I DON'T KNOW.

359
00:19:30,537 --> 00:19:33,606
JUST SEEMED LIKE SUCH
A CHRISTMASSY THING TO DO.

360
00:19:35,107 --> 00:19:36,376
OH, WELL,
JUST WRITE ME A CHECK

361
00:19:36,376 --> 00:19:38,077
FOR THE EARRINGS,
AND I'LL BE GOING.

362
00:19:38,077 --> 00:19:41,047
ALL RIGHT.
THAT WAS $500,

363
00:19:41,047 --> 00:19:44,251
AND SHE BETTER
BE FANTASTIC.

364
00:19:44,251 --> 00:19:45,918
THERE WE GO.

365
00:19:45,918 --> 00:19:46,986
ALL RIGHT.

366
00:19:46,986 --> 00:19:48,855
WELL, THANK YOU
VERY MUCH.

367
00:19:48,855 --> 00:19:50,923
YOU'RE SURE
YOU'RE NOT UPSET
ABOUT THIS?

368
00:19:50,923 --> 00:19:52,959
NO. I'M JUST GONNA GO OVER
TO MY MOM'S HOUSE.

369
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:55,762
SHE'S PROBABLY STILL UP,
GETTING EVERYTHING
READY FOR TOMORROW--

370
00:19:55,762 --> 00:19:58,097
YOU KNOW, BAKING THE BREAD
AND ICING THE COOKIES

371
00:19:58,097 --> 00:19:59,732
AND STUFFING THE TURKEY.

372
00:19:59,732 --> 00:20:01,301
STUFFING?

373
00:20:01,301 --> 00:20:04,103
OH, YEAH. MY MOM
MAKES IT FROM SCRATCH.

374
00:20:04,103 --> 00:20:06,539
GEE, SO DOES MINE.

375
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:09,175
YEAH, BUT DOES YOUR MOM
MAKE IT BONE-DRY?

376
00:20:09,175 --> 00:20:11,311
YOU COULD GAG ON IT.

377
00:20:14,414 --> 00:20:15,815
HEY, DON'T TELL ME,

378
00:20:15,815 --> 00:20:18,518
DO YOU HAVE
A MANGER SCENE
ON YOUR FRONT LAWN?

379
00:20:18,518 --> 00:20:20,553
THE BIGGEST
ON OUR BLOCK.

380
00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:21,588
OH!

381
00:20:21,588 --> 00:20:23,390
THE WISE MEN
ARE MY FAVORITE.

382
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:25,392
OH! I LOVE BALTHAZAR.

383
00:20:25,392 --> 00:20:29,195
BALTHAZAR'S GOOD,
BUT MELCHIOR'S THE BEST.

384
00:20:29,195 --> 00:20:30,830
LISTEN,
I'D INTRODUCE YOU TWO,

385
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:32,965
BUT SOMETHING TELLS ME
YOU'VE KNOWN EACH OTHER
FOR YEARS.

386
00:20:34,867 --> 00:20:36,836
YOU DRIVING, CARL?

387
00:20:36,836 --> 00:20:40,940
NO WAY, B.J.
I'M OVER MY LIMIT.

388
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:41,841
DON'T ASK ME.

389
00:20:41,841 --> 00:20:44,210
I'LL GONNA SLEEP
WHERE I FALL.

390
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:47,380
DOESN'T THAT
JUST EPITOMIZE

391
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:49,215
THE SPIRIT OF CHRISTMAS
IN THE EIGHTIES--

392
00:20:49,215 --> 00:20:52,552
A GAGGLE OF PIE-EYED
SANTA CLAUSES

393
00:20:52,552 --> 00:20:55,021
ALL TRYING TO FIND
A DESIGNATED DRIVER

394
00:20:55,021 --> 00:20:57,390
FOR THE SLEIGH RIDE
HOME.

395
00:20:57,390 --> 00:21:00,226
WELL, I HATE TO LEAVE,

396
00:21:00,226 --> 00:21:03,363
BUT I'VE GOT
A BUSY NIGHT

397
00:21:03,363 --> 00:21:06,499
AND A LONG HAUL
AHEAD OF ME.

398
00:21:09,235 --> 00:21:11,704
ANYONE REMEMBER
THAT GUY FROM CLASS?

399
00:21:11,704 --> 00:21:13,673
BEATS ME. I THOUGHT
HE WAS YOUR FRIEND.

400
00:21:13,673 --> 00:21:15,074
NO, NO.

401
00:21:15,074 --> 00:21:16,242
HE CAME IN YOUR CAR.

402
00:21:16,242 --> 00:21:17,410
I'D SWEAR HE CAME--

403
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:19,045
WAIT A SECOND NOW!

404
00:21:19,045 --> 00:21:22,014
YOU DON'T SUPPOSE...

405
00:21:22,014 --> 00:21:23,550
[MUFFLED SOUND]

406
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:25,452
DID YOU HEAR THAT?

407
00:21:25,452 --> 00:21:26,753
I SUPPOSE IT COULD BE
THE WIND,

408
00:21:26,753 --> 00:21:28,521
BUT IT SOUNDED
LIKE SLEIGH BELLS.

409
00:21:28,521 --> 00:21:30,857
OH, COME ON, GUYS.

410
00:21:30,857 --> 00:21:33,593
SERIOUSLY,
THERE MUST BE
SOME EXPLANATION.

411
00:21:33,593 --> 00:21:34,894
OH...

412
00:21:37,764 --> 00:21:39,732
YOU THINK
THERE ACTUALLY
COULD BE A...

413
00:21:43,269 --> 00:21:44,904
MY WIFE'S
GOING TO KILL ME.

414
00:21:44,904 --> 00:21:47,206
I LEFT THE LIGHTS ON
IN THE STATION WAGON AGAIN.

415
00:21:47,206 --> 00:21:49,041
CAN ONE OF YOU GUYS
GIVE ME A JUMP?

416
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:56,883
LILITH,
THAT WAS A MIRACLE.

417
00:21:56,883 --> 00:21:59,652
SNOWBALL, YOU'VE HAD
TOO MUCH SCHNAPPS.

418
00:21:59,652 --> 00:22:02,221
NO, NO. I'M STONE SOBER.

419
00:22:02,221 --> 00:22:04,391
I KNOW THAT'S JUST
SOME FAT OLD GUY
WITH CAR TROUBLE.

420
00:22:04,391 --> 00:22:06,359
BUT FOR A HALF-SECOND THERE,

421
00:22:06,359 --> 00:22:08,094
I ACTUALLY BELIEVED
IN CHRISTMAS.

422
00:22:08,094 --> 00:22:11,731
THAT HASN'T HAPPENED TO ME
SINCE I WAS...

423
00:22:11,731 --> 00:22:13,500
BORN.

424
00:22:15,034 --> 00:22:18,204
COME ON! LET'S SING
SOME CHRISTMAS CAROLS,

425
00:22:18,204 --> 00:22:20,440
ROAST SOME CHESTNUTS,

426
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:22,409
AND ALL THAT TREACLE.

427
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:26,479
* DECK THE HALLS
WITH BOUGHS OF HOLLY *

428
00:22:26,479 --> 00:22:29,348
* FA LA LA LA LA
LA LA LA LA *

429
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:31,551
* 'TIS THE SEASON
TO BE JOLLY *

430
00:22:31,551 --> 00:22:33,986
* FA LA LA LA LA
LA LA LA LA *

431
00:22:33,986 --> 00:22:37,289
SAMMY, I DON'T WANT
TO BE UNGRATEFUL
OR ANYTHING,

432
00:22:37,289 --> 00:22:40,927
BUT THIS SOAP
SUCKS WIND!

433
00:22:40,927 --> 00:22:43,530
YOU BOUGHT
MISS HUMBUG
DIAMOND EARRINGS.

434
00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:45,665
COME ON, NOW, THERE WAS
A REASON FOR THAT.

435
00:22:45,665 --> 00:22:47,199
SHE HAS INVITED ME OVER

436
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:49,636
FOR AN INTIMATE
LATE-NIGHT SUPPER.

437
00:22:49,636 --> 00:22:53,072
YEAH, YOU, ME,
AND HALF THE PEOPLE
IN THIS BAR.

438
00:22:54,741 --> 00:22:56,509
DON'T KID AROUND
WITH ME.

439
00:22:56,509 --> 00:22:58,711
I'M IN FAR TOO FRAGILE
A CONDITION.

440
00:22:58,711 --> 00:23:02,148
YOU MEAN, YOU THOUGHT
YOU WERE GONNA BE
THE ONLY...

441
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:05,818
I WASN'T TOO THRILLED
ABOUT THE SOAP,

442
00:23:05,818 --> 00:23:08,187
BUT THIS
MAKES UP FOR IT.

443
00:23:08,187 --> 00:23:10,790
* ...LA LA LA LA **

444
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:13,359
HEY, LOOK
IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE
IS ON AGAIN!

445
00:23:13,359 --> 00:23:14,627
IT'S THE VERY BEST PART.

446
00:23:14,627 --> 00:23:16,663
TURN IT UP, SAM.

447
00:23:18,097 --> 00:23:22,802
* SHOULD OLD ACQUAINTANCE
BE FORGOT *

448
00:23:22,802 --> 00:23:24,504
* AND NEVER BROUGHT... *

449
00:23:24,504 --> 00:23:26,372
I'M GLAD I CAN FINALLY
SAY THIS TO YOU

450
00:23:26,372 --> 00:23:28,374
WITHOUT HAVING MY HEAD
BITTEN OFF--

451
00:23:28,374 --> 00:23:30,409
MERRY CHRISTMAS,
FRASIER.

452
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:32,411
IT IS, ISN'T IT?

453
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:34,180
WE HAVE EVERYTHING
