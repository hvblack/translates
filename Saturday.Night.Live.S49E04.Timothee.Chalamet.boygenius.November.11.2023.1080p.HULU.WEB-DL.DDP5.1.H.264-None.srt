1
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:02,761
>>> YOU'RE WATCHING NBC

2
00:00:02,761 --> 00:00:06,051
FROM THE
ADRIENNE ARSHT CENTER FOR THE
PERFORMING ARTS IN FLORIDA,

3
00:00:06,051 --> 00:00:08,697
IT'S THE THIRD REPUBLICAN DEBATE.

4
00:00:13,791 --> 00:00:17,870
>> GOOD EVENING.
I'M LESTER HOLT

5
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:21,646
AND WELCOME TO
THE REPUBLICAN KIDS TABLE
DEBATE.

6
00:00:21,646 --> 00:00:23,245
LET'S MEET THE CANDIDATES.

7
00:00:23,245 --> 00:00:26,087
FORMER NEW JERSEY GOVERNOR CHRIS
CHRISTIE.

8
00:00:26,087 --> 00:00:29,815
>> MY WIFE SAID I COULD TRY THIS
ONE MORE TIME.

9
00:00:30,167 --> 00:00:33,027
>> FORMER U.N. AMBASSADOR, NIKKI
HALEY.

10
00:00:33,027 --> 00:00:36,307
>> EXCITED TO LOOK GOOD IN
COMPARISON.

11
00:00:36,307 --> 00:00:40,146
>> FLORIDA GOVERNOR AND OWNER OF
THE WORLD'S MOST UPSETTING SMILE,

12
00:00:40,146 --> 00:00:42,145
RON DeSANTIS.

13
00:00:43,012 --> 00:00:45,996
ENTREPRENEUR, VEVIK RAMASWAMY.

14
00:00:45,996 --> 00:00:48,985
TONIGHT

15
00:00:48,985 --> 00:00:52,025
AND SENATOR TIM SCOTT.

16
00:00:52,025 --> 00:00:54,725
>> IS THAT ME?

17
00:00:54,725 --> 00:00:56,368
>> IT IS.

18
00:00:56,468 --> 00:00:57,820
LET'S GET TO THE QUESTIONS.

19
00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:03,194
MR. RAMASWAMY, IF ELECTED, WHAT
WOULD YOU DO ON YOUR FIRST DAY
IN OFFICE?

20
00:01:03,194 --> 00:01:07,082
>> I WOULD LIKE TO BEGIN BY NOT
ANSWERING YOUR QUESTION,

21
00:01:07,082 --> 00:01:11,266
AND
INSTEAD USE THIS PLATFORM TO SAY
HER DAUGHTER IS ON TIKTOK.

22
00:01:11,266 --> 00:01:14,466
>> KEEP MY DAUGHTER'S NAME OUT
OF YOUR VOICE.

23
00:01:14,466 --> 00:01:16,853
>> ALMOST SAID THAT RIGHT.

24
00:01:16,853 --> 00:01:19,881
MR. SCOTT, ANYTHING YOU WOULD
LIKE TO ADD?

25
00:01:19,881 --> 00:01:22,219
>> I HAVE A GIRLFRIEND.

26
00:01:22,582 --> 00:01:24,656
>> OKAY.

27
00:01:24,656 --> 00:01:27,032
>> LISTEN.
ABOUT HER, SHE'S REAL,

28
00:01:27,032 --> 00:01:29,654
AND I
KNOW HER, AND SHE IS MY GIRLFRIEND,

29
00:01:29,654 --> 00:01:31,251
AND WE MET THROUGH DATING,

30
00:01:31,251 --> 00:01:34,994
AND FOR HER, I FEEL A
REAL SENSE OF HUMAN LOVE.

31
00:01:34,994 --> 00:01:36,519
>> GOT IT.

32
00:01:36,519 --> 00:01:40,393
NOW, FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP IS
LEADING IN THE POLLS WITH 56%.

33
00:01:40,393 --> 00:01:43,821
AMBASSADOR HAILEY, WHY SHOULD
VOTERS CONSIDER YOU INSTEAD?

34
00:01:43,821 --> 00:01:48,589
>> LOOK, HE WAS THE RIGHT CHOICE
IN 2016, BUT WE NEED TO MOVE ON.

35
00:01:48,589 --> 00:01:52,681
I PROMISE YOU ONE OF US ON THIS
STAGE TONIGHT

36
00:01:52,681 --> 00:01:57,301
WILL BE THE
REPUBLICAN NOMINEE FOR
PRESIDENT.

37
00:01:58,311 --> 00:02:01,138
>> HOW ADORABLE.

38
00:02:01,138 --> 00:02:03,713
THEY ACTUALLY THINK THEY'VE GOT
A CHANCE.

39
00:02:03,713 --> 00:02:06,887
SAD IN SOME WAYS, BUT IN OTHER
WAYS, FUNNY.

40
00:02:06,887 --> 00:02:10,532
CAN YOU BELIEVE IT, FOLKS?
91 INDICTMENTS, FOUR TRIALS,

41
00:02:10,532 --> 00:02:13,184
AND
I'M STILL THE BEST CHOICE.

42
00:02:13,184 --> 00:02:15,149
NOW THEY'RE ALL STUCK BEHIND ME,

43
00:02:15,149 --> 00:02:17,898
AND THERE'S NOTHING THEY CAN DO
ABOUT IT, JUST LIKE IN REAL
LIFE.

44
00:02:17,898 --> 00:02:23,456
3%, 8%, 14%, 5%.

45
00:02:23,456 --> 00:02:26,058
AND HOW ABOUT POOR TIM SCOTT,
HUH?

46
00:02:26,058 --> 00:02:28,784
1%.
VERY LOW.

47
00:02:28,835 --> 00:02:32,666
LOWER THAN FRANKLY MILK.

48
00:02:33,144 --> 00:02:37,171
APPARENTLY THERE'S A MILK LOWER
THAN 1%.
PEOPLE ARE CALLING IT SKIM.

49
00:02:37,171 --> 00:02:39,450
WE'VE NEVER HAD IT.
WE DON'T DRINK IT.

50
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:41,551
BUT WE LIKE SKIM SCOTT.
WE LOVE HIM.

51
00:02:41,551 --> 00:02:42,874
AND HIS GIRLFRIEND.

52
00:02:42,874 --> 00:02:45,679
NOT A LOT OF CHEMISTRY BETWEEN
THOSE TWO, RIGHT?

53
00:02:45,748 --> 00:02:50,169
THEY MAKE ME AND MELANIA LOOK
LIKE TAYLOR AND TRAVIS.

54
00:02:50,408 --> 00:02:54,284
AND HOW ABOUT VIVEK RAMASWAMY?

55
00:02:54,284 --> 00:02:57,451
WE LIKE TO SAY RAMASWAMY,

56
00:02:57,554 --> 00:03:01,344
BUT DO WE LIKE HIM?
HE MAKES IT HARD, DOESN'T HE?

57
00:03:01,344 --> 00:03:06,320
HE CHECKS A LOT OF BOXES.
HE'S RICH, RUDE, HE'S GOT WEIRD
HAIR.

58
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:09,538
HE'S A LOT LIKE ME EXCEPT FOR ONE THING

59
00:03:09,538 --> 00:03:13,747
THAT MATTERS A LOT TO
MY HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE BASE,

60
00:03:13,747 --> 00:03:15,900
WHITE.

61
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:18,405
SAD HE'S GOING NOWHERE.

62
00:03:18,405 --> 00:03:22,608
LOOK WHO SNL HAS PLAYING HIM.
POOR EGO.

63
00:03:23,338 --> 00:03:26,135
YOU DON'T LIKE IT, SHE DOESN'T
LIKE IT.

64
00:03:26,135 --> 00:03:28,944
SHE USED TO BE LISA FROM
TEMECULA.

65
00:03:28,944 --> 00:03:32,783
NOW SHE'S VIVEK FROM RAMASWAMY.

66
00:03:32,783 --> 00:03:36,777
AND LOOK WHO THEY GOT PLAYING
MEATBALL RON.

67
00:03:36,777 --> 00:03:39,008
ONE OF THE DESTROY BOYS.

68
00:03:39,008 --> 00:03:42,106
RON'S WATCHING AT HOME LIKE, WHO
THE HELL IS THAT.

69
00:03:42,106 --> 00:03:46,381
POOR RON DeSANTIS.
EVEN SNL DOESN'T THINK HE HAS A
CHANCE.

70
00:03:46,381 --> 00:03:50,375
IF THEY DID, IT WOULD BE LIKE
PAUL RUDD OR SOMETHING IN THERE,
RIGHT?

71
00:03:50,468 --> 00:03:52,889
HOW ABOUT NIKKI HALEY, RIGHT?

72
00:03:52,889 --> 00:03:56,007
I CALL HER BIRD BRAIN, BUT ONLY
IN PUBLIC.

73
00:03:56,007 --> 00:03:58,490
SHE MADE SOME TERRIBLE POINTS IN
THAT DEBATE.

74
00:03:58,490 --> 00:04:00,073
I THINK.
I DON'T REALLY KNOW.

75
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:03,370
I HAVE TROUBLE HEARING WOMEN
OVER 25.

76
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:08,340
BUT LET'S BE HONEST.
WE'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE A
PRESIDENT WHOSE NAME IS NIKKI.

77
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:12,303
PRESIDENT NIKKI.
JUST DOESN'T SOUND RIGHT.

78
00:04:12,303 --> 00:04:14,947
PROBABLY BECAUSE IT'S A WOMAN'S
NAME.

79
00:04:14,947 --> 00:04:17,813
AND HOW CAN WE FORGET CHRIS
CHRISTIE?

80
00:04:17,813 --> 00:04:21,037
IT'S ACTUALLY PRETTY EASY.
YOU JUST WALK AWAY.

81
00:04:21,621 --> 00:04:26,238
ISN'T IT SAD, FOLKS, NONE OF
THEM CAN BEAT JOE BIDEN,

82
00:04:26,238 --> 00:04:29,754
THE
WORST PRESIDENT SINCE, FRANKLY,
ME.

83
00:04:29,754 --> 00:04:31,888
JOE BIDEN, HE'S SO OLD.

84
00:04:31,888 --> 00:04:34,881
THE MENTALS ARE CLEARLY IN
DECLINE.

85
00:04:34,881 --> 00:04:37,142
AND I AM LOSING IT ALSO.

86
00:04:37,142 --> 00:04:39,959
YOU'RE SEEING IT ALL THE TIME.
WE'RE SEEING IT A LOT.

87
00:04:39,959 --> 00:04:42,627
I SAY THINGS LIKE I'M BEATING
OBAMA.

88
00:04:42,627 --> 00:04:45,716
THAT'S NOT RIGHT.
BUT I SAY IT.
IT'S FUN.

89
00:04:45,716 --> 00:04:49,293
AND THEY SAY, WHY AREN'T YOU AT
THE DEBATE, MR. TRUMP.

90
00:04:49,401 --> 00:04:50,719
WHERE'S TRUMP?

91
00:04:50,719 --> 00:04:54,563
BUT I COULDN'T BE AT THE DEBATE
BECAUSE I'M VERY, VERY BUSY.

92
00:04:54,563 --> 00:04:57,343
I'M GOING FROM TRIAL TO TRIAL.

93
00:04:57,343 --> 00:05:00,778
I'M BASICALLY DOING HOUSE
HUNTERS BUT WITH COURTROOMS.

94
00:05:00,778 --> 00:05:05,085
BUT HOW HORRIBLE ARE THESE
TRIALS, MAKING ALL MY CHILDREN
TESTIFY AGAINST ME.

95
00:05:05,085 --> 00:05:09,008
MY SWEET LITTLE MIDDLE-AGED
CRIMINAL CHILDREN.

96
00:05:09,008 --> 00:05:11,824
SO AWFUL TO BRING IN THE FAMILY.

97
00:05:11,824 --> 00:05:15,236
IT'LL BE VERY SAD WHEN I PIN IT
ALL ON ONE OF THEM,

98
00:05:15,236 --> 00:05:17,008
PROBABLY
ERIC.

99
00:05:17,008 --> 00:05:21,530
WOW, LOOK AT THEM BACK THERE
STILL FROZEN,

100
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:23,679
TRYING NOT TO
BLINK, TRYING NOT TO MOVE.

101
00:05:23,679 --> 00:05:27,069
STUCK ON STAGE WHILE I COOK.

102
00:05:27,958 --> 00:05:31,272
BUT THEY'RE AFTER ME, FOLKS.
THEY'RE COMING AFTER ME.

103
00:05:31,272 --> 00:05:34,114
THEY'RE SAYING I COMMITTED
FRAUD.
NOT TRUE.

104
00:05:34,114 --> 00:05:37,730
I'VE COMMITTED A LOT OF THINGS,
ADULTERY, TREASON,

105
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:40,043
A LOT OF FRAUD PERHAPS,

106
00:05:40,043 --> 00:05:42,885
BUT I'VE BEEN ON
MY BEST BEHAVIOR IN COURT.

107
00:05:42,885 --> 00:05:46,404
THE JUDGE ASKS, DID YOU APPROVE
THESE FINANCIAL REPORTS,

108
00:05:46,404 --> 00:05:51,240
AND I
VERY RESPECTFULLY SAY YOU'RE A
DUMB ASS, THIS IS A SHAM.

109
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:54,893
WHEN I'M PRESIDENT AGAIN, I'LL
HAVE YOU EXECUTED.

110
00:05:54,893 --> 00:05:58,309
THEY'RE NOT BIG FANS, ESPECIALLY
TISH JAMES,

111
00:05:58,309 --> 00:06:01,023
ATTORNEY GENERAL WHO
IS VERY RACIST.

112
00:06:01,023 --> 00:06:05,008
THE WORST KIND OF RACISM, RACISM
AGAINST WHITES.

113
00:06:05,008 --> 00:06:08,631
AFTER EVERYTHING WE'VE DONE FOR THE WORLD

114
00:06:08,631 --> 00:06:12,638
IN TERMS OF AIRPLANE
AND WITH REGARD TO BEACH BOYS.

115
00:06:12,638 --> 00:06:15,448
SO THAT CONCLUDES THE DEBATE,

116
00:06:15,448 --> 00:06:19,326
AND THAT'S PROBABLY A WRAP ON
SOME OF THESE IMPRESSIONS AS
WELL.

117
00:06:19,326 --> 00:06:22,446
LOOK AT EGO, SO RELIEVED.

118
00:06:22,446 --> 00:06:27,032
ANYWAY, I'LL PICK ONE OF THESE
LUCKY FIVE TO BE MY VP,

119
00:06:27,032 --> 00:06:29,177
OR IN
MANY WAYS, I WILL NOT AT ALL.

120
00:06:29,247 --> 00:06:31,224
MAYBE IN MY THIRD TERM.

121
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:34,739
AND LIVE FROM NEW YORK, IT'S
SATURDAY NIGHT!

122
00:08:41,234 --> 00:08:46,040
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, TIMOTHEE
CHALAMET!

123
00:09:01,757 --> 00:09:03,937
>>> OH, MAN.

124
00:09:03,937 --> 00:09:06,971
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

125
00:09:06,971 --> 00:09:10,825
IT IS GREAT TO BE HERE.
IT'S MY SECOND TIME HOSTING
SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE.

126
00:09:12,022 --> 00:09:15,601
BUT IN A LOT OF WAYS, IT FEELS
LIKE MY FIRST TIME

127
00:09:15,601 --> 00:09:17,423
BECAUSE THE
LAST TIME WAS DURING COVID,

128
00:09:17,423 --> 00:09:20,232
AND
THAT WAS JUST WEIRD.
I WAS WEARING A MASK THE WHOLE
WEEK.

129
00:09:20,232 --> 00:09:22,352
I DON'T THINK LAUREN MICHAELS
KNEW WHO I WAS.

130
00:09:22,352 --> 00:09:25,038
KEPT CALLING ME WYNONA.

131
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:28,721
AFTER STRIKE

132
00:09:28,721 --> 00:09:32,782
I'VE BEEN TOLD TWO DAYS AGO, AND
I KNOW THIS IS WHAT WE WERE ALL THINKING ABOUT,

133
00:09:32,782 --> 00:09:35,086
ACTORS COULDN'T
TALK ABOUT THEIR MOVIES.

134
00:09:35,087 --> 00:09:39,203
ONLY THING I WAS ALLOWED TO TALK
ABOUT WAS THE PERFUME I HAVE
COMING OUT.

135
00:09:39,203 --> 00:09:42,828
IT'S AN ADD FOR A PERFUME
DIRECTED BY MARTIN SCORSESE.

IS, MAN, I REALLY HOPE IT'S A
PERFUME COMMERCIAL.

138
00:09:53,057 --> 00:09:55,325
NOW THE STRIKE IS OVER,

139
00:09:55,325 --> 00:10:01,575

THIS IS THE SPLENDOR OF NATURE.

1359
01:05:11,875 --> 01:05:13,908
AS THE SUN SET AND THE CITY FELT

QUIET, THE SOFT WINDS WHOOSHED

GARDEN WHERE DAPHNE WAS PLANTING

1363
01:05:24,554 --> 01:05:24,953
SUNFLOWERS.

1364

THAT WAS HER PLACE OF PEACE.

1365

IS THE SLEEP STORY ABOUT A DOG

1372
01:05:42,372 --> 01:05:42,937

1376
01:05:45,876 --> 01:05:48,410
>> AND MAYBE A LITTLE LESS

1377
01:05:48,412 --> 01:05:50,245
CHATTER IN BETWEEN TAKES.

01:05:50,247 --> 01:05:52,147
COOL?

1379
01:05:52,149 --> 01:05:52,480
>> SURE.

ALL RIGHT.

1382
01:05:53,183 --> 01:05:55,517
THE GARDEN WAS FULL OF

1383
01:05:55,519 --> 01:05:55,884
POTENTIAL.

1384
01:05:55,886 --> 01:05:57,218
THERE WERE PLANTS TO POT,

1385
01:05:57,220 --> 01:05:58,420
FLOWERS TO BLOOM.

1386
01:05:58,422 --> 01:06:01,189
I SWEAR TO GOD IF HIS BLIND ASS

BRINGS THAT DUMB DOG ROUND HERE

1388
01:06:03,293 --> 01:06:05,060
AGAIN, I'M GOING TO BE SERIOUSLY

1389
01:06:05,062 --> 01:06:05,927
PISSED OFF.

1390
01:06:05,929 --> 01:06:07,862
HELL, I MIGHT EVEN SWING ON HIM.

1391

I'M SORRY, AREN'T PEOPLE

1392

YOU'RE SURE?

1404
