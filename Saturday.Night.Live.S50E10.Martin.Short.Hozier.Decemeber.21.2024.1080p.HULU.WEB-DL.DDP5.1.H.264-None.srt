1
00:00:02,215 --> 00:00:03,986
>>> HELLO.

2
00:00:23,326 --> 00:00:26,622
HELLO.
I'M TOM HANKS.

3
00:00:27,992 --> 00:00:32,278
IN DECEMBER, 1990, I CREATED

4
00:00:32,278 --> 00:00:35,255
THE "SNL" FIVE-TIMERS CLUB.

5
00:00:35,255 --> 00:00:40,283
AND INGENIOUSLY LAZY WAY TO
AVOID WRITING A MONOLOGUE.

6
00:00:40,283 --> 00:00:44,950
IT HAS GROWN INTO ONE OF THE
MOST EXCLUSIVE CLUBS IN THE
INDUSTRY.

7
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:49,065
AND TONIGHT, WE ARE HERE TO
INDUCT OUR NEWEST MEMBER.

8
00:00:49,065 --> 00:00:50,864
>> HEY.

9
00:00:57,559 --> 00:00:59,390
>> TOM.

10
00:01:01,182 --> 00:01:05,293
TOM, I GOT TO ASK, WHO THE HELL
ARE YOU TALKING TO HERE, PAL?

11
00:01:05,293 --> 00:01:09,236
>> I'M SORRY.
I'M SORRY.
I'VE DONE SO MANY DOCUMENTARIES,

12
00:01:09,236 --> 00:01:13,726
WHEN EVER I SIT IN A LEATHER
CHAIR I NATURALLY ASSUME I'M IN
ONE.

13
00:01:13,726 --> 00:01:17,752
>> SHOULD WE LET HIM IN?
HE'S BEEN STANDING OUTSIDE FOR
20 MINUTES.

14
00:01:17,752 --> 00:01:20,093
>> ABSOLUTELY.

15
00:01:21,131 --> 00:01:25,746
MARTIN ORT, WELCOME TO THE
FIVE-TIMERS CLUB.

16
00:01:28,276 --> 00:01:32,458
>> OH MY GOODNESS GRACIOUS.

17
00:01:36,915 --> 00:01:40,449
WHAT A SURPRISE THAT I'VE KNOWN
ABOUT ALL WEEK.

18
00:01:40,449 --> 00:01:42,484
>> WELL, GET OVER HERE, MARTY.

19
00:01:42,484 --> 00:01:46,397
HEY, HAVE THEY TAUGHT YOU THE
SECRET HANDSHAKE?
>> OF COURSE THEY HAVE.

20
00:01:46,397 --> 00:01:49,762
>> ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR, FIVE.

21
00:01:49,762 --> 00:01:52,297
>> YOU'RE GREAT.
>> YOU'RE GREAT.

22
00:01:52,297 --> 00:01:56,458
>> HEY, WHAT DO THEY CALL YOU BY
THE WAY, MARTY OR MARTIN?

23
00:01:56,458 --> 00:01:58,472
>> WELL, MY FRIENDS ALL CALL ME MARTY,

24
00:01:58,472 --> 00:02:01,479
SO YOU CAN CALL ME MR.
MARTIN SHORT.

25
00:02:03,573 --> 00:02:06,934
>> MARTY, CONGRATULATIONS!

26
00:02:17,255 --> 00:02:19,852
YOU KNOW, I AM SO GLAD YOU'RE
HERE.

27
00:02:19,852 --> 00:02:21,832
YOU'RE ONE OF THE RASHEST THINGS
IN HOLLYWOOD.

28
00:02:21,832 --> 00:02:26,070
A WRITER BUT ATTRACTIVE ENOUGH
TO BE ON CAMERA.

29
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:29,290
>> AND YOU'RE ONE OF THE LEAST
RARE THINGS IN HOLLYWOOD,

30
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:31,529
A LOUD
MAN.

31
00:02:31,746 --> 00:02:36,179
>> THANK YOU, MISSY.
YOU'RE RIGHT.
YOU'RE SO RIGHT.

32
00:02:36,513 --> 00:02:39,170
>> HEY, THANK YOU, KID.

33
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:43,153
MARTIN, MAY I OFFER YOU OUR
SIGNATURE COCKTAIL,

34
00:02:43,153 --> 00:02:45,979
THE
MARTY-TINI.

35
00:02:45,979 --> 00:02:48,463
>> IT'S JUST LIKE YOU.
SUPER SWEET

36
00:02:48,463 --> 00:02:51,879
AND AFTER A FEW SIPS
YOU'RE LIKE, I GET IT.

37
00:02:51,879 --> 00:02:56,011
>> YOU KNOW, IT'S OFTEN PAIRED
WITH OUR STEVE MAR --

38
00:02:56,011 --> 00:02:58,537
TONIGHT

39
00:02:58,537 --> 00:03:02,275
>> I BET IT'S BETTER ON ITS OWN.

40
00:03:03,068 --> 00:03:07,207
>> FIRST THINGS FIRST.
FIVE TIMER

41
00:03:07,207 --> 00:03:09,981
QUICK, NAME THREE CURRENT CAST
MEMBERS.

42
00:03:09,981 --> 00:03:11,884
>> NO IDEA.
>> CORRECT!

43
00:03:11,884 --> 00:03:14,627
AND THAT WAS THE WHOLE TEST.

44
00:03:16,666 --> 00:03:20,749
>> AND, HEY, YOU PICKED A GREAT
TIME TO BE HERE TO JOIN.

45
00:03:20,749 --> 00:03:23,885
THIS IS OUR ANNUAL CHRISTMAS
PARTY.

46
00:03:23,885 --> 00:03:26,513
>> YES.
AND I LOVE THE DECORATIONS, MY
GOODNESS.

47
00:03:26,513 --> 00:03:30,453
>> YES.
THESE ARE ACTUALLY SCRIPTS
THAT WE ALL SABOTAGED

48
00:03:30,453 --> 00:03:33,288
BECAUSE A CAST
MEMBER HAD A BETTER PART THAN WE
DID.

49
00:03:33,288 --> 00:03:34,849
>> I CAN DO THAT?

50
00:03:34,849 --> 00:03:37,409
>> ABSOLUTELY.
>> OF COURSE YOU CAN.

51
00:03:44,604 --> 00:03:48,128
YOU'RE A FIVE-TIMER NOW.
THE RULES ARE ALL DIFFERENT.

52
00:03:48,128 --> 00:03:50,331
>> ALEC, LOOK AT YOUR ROBE.

53
00:03:50,331 --> 00:03:54,887
>> WELL, THAT'S RIGHT, I'VE
HOSTED 17 TIMES.

54
00:03:54,887 --> 00:03:57,379
HAPPEN TO BE A VERY USEFUL TYPE OF THE SHOW,

55
00:03:57,379 --> 00:04:00,254
THEY CALL ME WHEN
THEY NEED SOMEBODY TO PLAY
A REPUBLICAN.

56
00:04:00,254 --> 00:04:03,042
APPARENTLY BECAUSE OF MY FACE,
MY VOICE

57
00:04:03,042 --> 00:04:05,974
AND MY STRONG DADDY
VIBES.
>> YES.

58
00:04:05,974 --> 00:04:07,776
>> REALLY?
A DADDY VIBE?

59
00:04:07,776 --> 00:04:09,618
>> GO TO YOUR ROOM, TINA.

60
00:04:09,618 --> 00:04:12,392
>> I WONDER WHO THAT IS.

61
00:04:13,424 --> 00:04:15,648
>> HI, EVERYONE.

62
00:04:23,218 --> 00:04:28,048
>> WE HAVE A NEW CAST MEMBER.
WHERE SHOULD I PUT THIS SECRET
SANTA GIFT?

63
00:04:28,048 --> 00:04:30,935
>> OH, I'LL TAKE THAT GIFT.
I HAVE TO PUT MINE UNDER THE
TREE, TOO.

64
00:04:30,935 --> 00:04:34,362
>> NOW, IT'S NOT ANOTHER BOOK
ABOUT WORLD WAR II, IS IT, TOM?

65
00:04:34,362 --> 00:04:37,736
>> NO.
IT'S ABOUT OUTER SPACE.

66
00:04:38,408 --> 00:04:40,388
>> HEY, GUYS.

67
00:04:48,507 --> 00:04:50,542
>> WHY ARE YOU WEARING A
BATHROBE?

68
00:04:50,542 --> 00:04:54,011
>> IN A BATHROBE, I'M NOT LIVING
HERE.

69
00:04:54,151 --> 00:04:55,842
>> NO ONE SAID THAT.

70
00:04:55,842 --> 00:04:59,201
>> GOOD.
BECAUSE I'M NOT LIVING HERE.

71
00:05:00,355 --> 00:05:03,811
>> HELLO, MARTIN.
>> HELLO, KRISTIN.

72
00:05:03,811 --> 00:05:08,291
>> I HOPE YOU'RE NOT EXPECTING A
REPEAT OF LAST TIME WE SAW EACH
OTHER.

73
00:05:08,291 --> 00:05:10,030
I'M NOT THAT GIRL ANYMORE.

74
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:13,095
>> AND I'M NOT THAT FLEXIBLE
ANYMORE.

75
00:05:13,095 --> 00:05:15,787
>> DID YOU TWO HAVE A THING?

76
00:05:15,787 --> 00:05:20,176
>> WE TOOK A HOT YOGA CLASS
TOGETHER WHERE WE MADE LOVE AND
GOT KICKED OUT

77
00:05:20,176 --> 00:05:22,545
AND WE BOTH VOTED
FOR TRUMP.

78
00:05:22,545 --> 00:05:25,353
>> DON'T TELL THEM THAT.
>> IT'S OKAY.

79
00:05:25,353 --> 00:05:29,313
IN THIS CLUB YOU CAN BE
COMPLETELY HONEST.
ANYONE ELSE WANT TO TRY?

80
00:05:29,313 --> 00:05:31,136
>> I'LL GO.

81
00:05:31,136 --> 00:05:34,650
ANTMAN'S POWERS AREN'T GOOD.

82
00:05:36,229 --> 00:05:40,853
>> I'LL GO.
IT'S ME THAT'S FLYING THOSE
DRONES.
ALL OF THEM.

83
00:05:41,673 --> 00:05:45,613
>> I'LL GO.
I NEVER HAD COVID.

84
00:05:46,392 --> 00:05:50,456
>> I'LL GO.
I HAVE COVID RIGHT NOW.

85
00:05:50,456 --> 00:05:53,698
>> I'LL GO.
I HAVE WAY TOO MANY CHILDREN.

86
00:05:53,698 --> 00:05:55,607
>> SEE, WE FEEL BETTER ALREADY.

87
00:05:55,607 --> 00:05:59,405
BUT WAIT, IS THIS A FIVE-TIMERS
THINK OR ONLY "MURDERS"
REUNION.

88
00:05:59,405 --> 00:06:03,156
>> IT IS TRUE.
TINA AND PAUL WERE BOTH GUEST
STARS.

89
00:06:03,156 --> 00:06:08,158
ISN'T IT EMBARRASSING WHEN A
SHOW THROWS BIG NAME CAMEOS FOR
CHEAP RATING BOOSTS.

90
00:06:08,158 --> 00:06:11,634
>> IT'S THE WORST.
IT'S THE WORST POSSIBLE
THING.

91
00:06:23,513 --> 00:06:26,147
>> CONGRATULATIONS, MARTY.

92
00:06:26,147 --> 00:06:29,511
HONESTLY, THIS IS SUCH AN
ACCOMPLISHMENT.

93
00:06:29,999 --> 00:06:33,794
>> HELLO, KRISTIN.
>> EMMA.

94
00:06:33,794 --> 00:06:38,137
>> I HOPE YOU'RE NOT EXPECTING A
REPEAT OF WHAT HAPPENED WHEN I
SAW YOU LAST TIME.

95
00:06:38,137 --> 00:06:40,873
>> I'M NOT THAT GIRL ANYMORE.
>> AND I'M NOT THAT DRUNK.

96
00:06:40,873 --> 00:06:43,837
BUT YOU SHOULD KNOW, I'M GETTING
CLOSE.

97
00:06:45,075 --> 00:06:47,245
>> GOOD.

98
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:55,300
>> WELL, I JUST HAVE TO SAY THAT
IT IS SO NICE TO SEE EACH OTHER
OUTSIDE OF A SKETCH.

99
00:06:55,300 --> 00:07:00,426
WE CAN ACT LIKE THE DIGNIFIED
SALT OF THE EARTH CELEBRITY
FOLKS THAT WE ARE.

100
00:07:00,426 --> 00:07:05,037
>> NORMALLY YOU WOULD BE
CHUGGING RANCH DRESSING AND
CRASHING THROUGH A TABLE BY NOW.

101
00:07:05,037 --> 00:07:08,415
>> OH, MARTY, FOR SHAME.
BUT EXACTLY.

102
00:07:08,415 --> 00:07:10,645
YEAH.
THIS IS A CLASSY PLACE.

103
00:07:10,645 --> 00:07:13,999
WE DON'T DO ANY OF THAT
SOPHOMORIC COMEDY HERE,
DO WE?

104
00:07:13,999 --> 00:07:18,894
NO.
BUT IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME, I'D
LIKE TO TREAT MYSELF TO A
COCKATAIL.

105
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:32,607
>> HI!

106
00:07:33,969 --> 00:07:37,673
SHE'LL BE FINE.
SHE'LL BE FINE.

107
00:07:39,628 --> 00:07:43,870
I JUST STOPPED BY TO SAY
CONGRATULATIONS.

108
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:46,491
>> JOHN, LOOK AT YOU.
LOOK AT YOU.

109
00:07:46,491 --> 00:07:50,133
I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT WE DID THAT
SITCOM TEN YEARS AGO.

110
00:07:50,133 --> 00:07:52,256
>> YOU COULD NEVER DO THAT SHOW
NOW.

111
00:07:52,256 --> 00:07:54,065
>> WHY, BECAUSE EVERYONE IS SO
WOKE?

112
00:07:54,065 --> 00:07:57,556
>> NO, BECAUSE IT WASN'T GOOD
AND NO ONE LIKED IT.

113
00:07:57,556 --> 00:08:01,444
>> BUT YOU CAME BACK STRONG.
AND THEN YOU CRASHED AND BURNED.

114
00:08:01,444 --> 00:08:05,573
AND THEN YOU CAME BACK STRONG.
AND WE'RE ALL SO CURIOUS WHAT
WILL HAPPEN NEXT.

115
00:08:05,573 --> 00:08:07,470
>> LET'S RAISE A TOAST, SHALL
WE?

116
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:09,695
>> OH S THERE ANYTHING
NONALCOHOLIC?

117
00:08:09,695 --> 00:08:13,672
>> DO YOU MEAN DRINKS OR PEOPLE,
BECAUSE EITHER WAY NO.

118
00:08:13,672 --> 00:08:17,925
>> WELL, MARTY, YOU'RE FINALLY

00:08:29,824 --> 00:08:32,014

124
00:08:32,014 --> 00:08:35,896
AND THEN I HAVE TO GO AND HOST
ANOTHER GAME SHOW AND LAUGH AT
MY OWN JOEX.

125
00:08:35,896 --> 00:08:39,211

LAUGHING.

00:12:45,924 --> 00:12:47,413
>> THANK YOU, LORNE.

149
00:12:47,413 --> 00:12:49,646
YOU KNOW, LORNE AND I ARE VERY
CLOSE FRIENDS.

150
00:12:49,646 --> 00:12:52,181
WE'RE KIND OF LIKE TRUMP AND ELON MUSK

151
00:12:52,181 --> 00:12:54,825
WITHOUT THE SEXUAL
TENSION, YOU KNOW.

152
00:12:54,825 --> 00:12:59,196
IN FACT, I'M REMINDED OF LORNE'S
WORDS AFTER EVERY SHOW I'M EVER
HOSTED.

153
00:12:59,196 --> 00:13:01,755
NEXT TIME

154
00:13:01,755 --> 00:13:05,887
TONIGHT I JOIN THE FIVE-TIMERS
CLUB.

155
00:13:09,643 --> 00:13:14,324
>> COME TO THINK OF IT, YOU
KNOW, FIVE MUST BE MY LUCKY
NUMBER.

156
00:13:14,324 --> 00:13:15,852
I MEAN, THIS IS MY FIFTH TIME
HOSTING.

157
00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:20,487
I'M ABLE TO START SEASON FIVE OF
ONLY MURDERS IN THE BUILDING.

158
00:13:22,727 --> 00:13:25,529
>> I OWN FIVE CYBERTRUCKS.

159
00:13:25,529 --> 00:13:29,469
NOT TO DRIVE.
IT'S JUST THEY'RE SO BEAUTIFUL.

160
00:13:29,469 --> 00:13:32,283
MY DEAR FRIEND STEVE MARTIN IS
ALSO PART OF THE CLUB.

161
00:13:32,283 --> 00:13:33,726
HE WOULD HAVE BEEN HERE TONIGHT,

162
00:13:33,726 --> 00:13:37,621
BUT HE HAD A CONFLICT WITH ME
NOT WANTING HIM TO BE HERE.

163
00:13:37,621 --> 00:13:40,405
>> AND BESIDES, IT'S REHEARSAL
WEEK FOR "THE MASKED SINGER."

164
00:13:40,405 --> 00:13:41,950
SO, YOU KNOW.

165
00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:44,669
STEVE AND I HAVE HOSTED TOGETHER
BEFORE, BUT YOU KNOW,

166
00:13:44,669 --> 00:13:47,308
HOSTING "S
NL" IS A LOT LIKE SEX.

167
00:13:47,308 --> 00:13:52,621
IT'S GREAT WITH A PARTNER, BUT
SOMETIMES IT'S GREAT TO KNOCK
ONE OUT BY YOURSELF.

168
00:13:52,621 --> 00:13:57,467
THIS WEEK HAS BEEN SO MUCH FUN.
AND THE CAST IS JUST SO
LOVELY --

169
00:13:57,467 --> 00:14:01,406
OH, HI, SARAH.

170
00:14:02,973 --> 00:14:06,992
>> IS THERE SOMETHING WRONG?
>> OH, MARTY, I DON'T KNOW WHAT
TO DO.

171
00:14:06,992 --> 00:14:10,579
I WANT TO HAVE THE HOLIDAY
SPIRIT, BUT ALL I FEEL IS DREAD.

172
00:14:10,579 --> 00:14:13,021
>> DON'T WORRY.
THAT HAIRCUT WILL GROW OUT.

173
00:14:13,021 --> 00:14:17,341
>> I WASN'T  ING ABOUT MY
HAIR.
>> YOU SHOULD HAVE BEEN.

174
00:14:17,341 --> 00:14:21,338
I GUESS I'M JUST UPSET BECAUSE
THE HOLIDAYS HAVE SUPPOSED TO BE FUN,

175
00:14:21,338 --> 00:14:24,954
BUT EVERYONE HERE IS SO
STRESSED OUT.
RIGHT, GUYS?

176
00:14:24,954 --> 00:14:27,932
>> YEAH.
YOU ALWAYS SEEM SO HAPPY.

177
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:32,719
>> WE WERE HOPING YOU COULD, I
DON'T KNOW, CHEER US UP?

178
00:14:32,719 --> 00:14:34,508
>> PLEASE, MARTY.
>> PLEASE.

179
00:14:34,508 --> 00:14:37,786

00:14:37,786 --> 00:14:41,778
>> SURE.
GATHER AROUND, YOUNGSTERS.
AND KENAN.

181
00:14:41,834 --> 00:14:44,801
THE HOLIDAYS ARE ALWAYS
STRESSFUL

182
00:14:44,801 --> 00:14:46,390
AND SURE, THE WORLD IS
GOING CRAZY,

183
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:48,732
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT,
I HAVE A SOLUTION.

184
00:14:48,732 --> 00:14:51,645
>> REALLY?
>> FOR THE PURPOSE OF THIS BIT,
SURE.

185
00:14:51,645 --> 00:14:53,225
AND I'LL TELL YOU HOW.

186
