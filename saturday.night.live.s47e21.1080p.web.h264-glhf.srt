1
00:00:03,157 --> 00:00:04,482
PENTAGON

2
00:00:04,482 --> 00:00:07,563
>>> HELLO ONCE AGAIN.

3
00:00:20,472 --> 00:00:24,431
NSA

4
00:00:24,431 --> 00:00:26,400
AND THIS IS SPECIAL AGENT
FITZSIMMONS.

5
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:30,054
>> YOU TWO ARE A GREAT INTEREST

6
00:00:30,054 --> 00:00:36,390
ABDUCTIONS

7
00:00:36,391 --> 00:00:38,877
WILD

8
00:00:38,877 --> 00:00:43,377
>> WE WERE JUST THREE GALS AT A
HOT SAUCE EXTO

9
00:00:43,377 --> 00:00:46,368
AND NOW WE'RE VIP
AT THE PENTAGON.

10
00:00:46,368 --> 00:00:49,712
>> I WOULD JUST LIKE TO SAY FOR THE RECORD,

11
00:00:49,712 --> 00:00:53,073
PENTAGON HAS ALWAYS
BEEN MY FAVORITE SHAPE,

12
00:00:53,073 --> 00:00:56,253
SO THIS
IS A REAL TREAT FOR ME.

13
00:00:56,253 --> 00:00:58,281
>> ALL RIGHT, GOOD TO HEAR.

14
00:00:58,281 --> 00:01:03,299
NOW, LET'S START WITH HOW YOU
WERE ALL BROUGHT INTO THE
SPACECRAFT.

15
00:01:03,299 --> 00:01:07,215
>> WELL, WE HAD PULLED OVER ON
THE SIDE OF THE HIGHWAY JUST TO STRETCH OUR LEGS

16
00:01:07,215 --> 00:01:11,391
AND SUDDENLY I
WAS ENVELOPED BY THIS WARM BLUE
LIGHT.

17
00:01:11,391 --> 00:01:16,020
>> AND IT GENTLY LIFTED US ON TO
THE SHIP LIKE WE WAS FLOATING.

18
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:20,604
THEN WE MET ALIENS MADE OF PURE
ENERGY.

19
00:01:20,604 --> 00:01:24,102
ALMOST LIKE ANGELS, SIR.
I ALMOST CRIED.

20
00:01:24,102 --> 00:01:27,235
AND YOU, MS. RAFFERTY?

21
00:01:28,301 --> 00:01:30,298
>> YEAH, SAME.

22
00:01:30,298 --> 00:01:35,332
>> OH, REALLY?
>> NO, OBVIOUSLY NOT.

23
00:01:35,332 --> 00:01:38,706
YEAH, I WASN'T SO MUCH GENTLY LIFTED

24
00:01:38,706 --> 00:01:44,886
AS I WAS YANKED SKYWARD
BY SOME SORT OF CLAW MACHINE DEVICE,

25
00:01:44,886 --> 00:01:48,658
AND MIND YOU, I'M
POPPING A SQUAT ON THE MEDIAN AT THE TIME

26
00:01:48,658 --> 00:01:53,868
SO I SLIDE RIGHT OUT OF
MY SLACKS AND I'M BECOME
ROCKETED UP TO THE SHIP.

27
00:01:53,869 --> 00:01:56,692
CUCKOO

28
00:01:56,692 --> 00:02:00,903
I BARELY MANAGED TO PULL MY
WONDER WEAR BACK UP.

29
00:02:00,903 --> 00:02:04,163
>> I'M SORRY, YOUR WONDER WEAR?

30
00:02:04,163 --> 00:02:08,185
>> YEAH, I CALL THEM THAT
BECAUSE IF YOU SAW THEM, YOU'D
WONDER WHERE THEY'D BEEN.

31
00:02:08,185 --> 00:02:12,592
ANYWAY, I GET DUMPED ON BOARD
THE BOTTOM OF THE SHIP,

32
00:02:12,592 --> 00:02:16,255
AND I
SEE MY LITTLE PALS, THE LITTLE
GRAY ALIENS WITH THE BIG DUMB
EYES.

33
00:02:16,255 --> 00:02:18,680
AND IT HITS ME, COLLEEN,

34
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:22,833
THIS MAY BE THE MOST STABLE
RELATIONSHIP YOU'VE EVER HAD.

35
00:02:22,902 --> 00:02:24,855
>> THAT'S UNFORTUNATE.

36
00:02:24,855 --> 00:02:27,224
NOW, ONCE YOU WERE ON BOARD,
WHAT HAPPENED?

37
00:02:27,224 --> 00:02:31,910
>> WELL, THE ALIENS SHOWED US,
LIKE, THE FIVE ELEMENTAL FORCES

38
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:34,599
THAT KNIT THE FABRIC OF REALITY
TOGETHER.

39
00:02:34,599 --> 00:02:36,549
AND Y'ALL WILL NEVER BELIEVE THIS,

40
00:02:36,549 --> 00:02:40,619
BUT THOSE PHI FORCES WERE
ARRANGE IN THE A PENTAGON.

41
00:02:40,619 --> 00:02:44,851
>> LIKE, THERE IS A UNIVERSAL
LANGUAGE THAT BONDS THE UNIVERSE TOGETHER,

42
00:02:44,851 --> 00:02:48,834
AND THE CLOSEST WORD
WE HAVE TO DESCRIBE IT IS LOVE.

43
00:02:48,834 --> 00:02:51,385
>> AND YOU, MS. RAFFERTY?

44
00:02:52,433 --> 00:02:55,830
>> YEAH, A LITTLE DIFFERENT DOWN
IN THIRD CLASS.

45
00:02:55,921 --> 00:02:59,994
I GET ON BOARD AND THE GRAY ALIENS, GOD BLESS THEM,

46
00:02:59,994 --> 00:03:04,946
THEY'RE
ALREADY STANDING IN LINE TO BAT
MY KNOCKERS AROUND,

47
00:03:04,946 --> 00:03:08,385
I THINK,
WHAT THE HELL, PLAY THE HITS.

48
00:03:08,935 --> 00:03:11,573
SO I START UNBUTTONING MY BLOUSE,

49
00:03:11,573 --> 00:03:15,098
BUT I'M IN MY SKIF VIS,
WHICH ARE REAL LOOSE.

50
00:03:15,098 --> 00:03:19,097
SO, MY ITSY AND BITSY ARE
FULL VIEW

51
00:03:19,097 --> 00:03:23,429
NOT TO GET TOO GRAPHIC, BUT
PUBICALLY SPEAKING,

52
00:03:23,429 --> 00:03:26,330
IT'S A
JUNGLE DOWN THERE.

53
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:29,315
I'VE GOT MORE HAIR POKING OUT THE SIDE

54
00:03:29,315 --> 00:03:33,746
THAN A HIPSTER'S BEARD
STUFFED INTO AN N-95.

55
00:03:35,647 --> 00:03:41,650
LOOK, I'M NOT PROUD OF IT, BUT,
HEY, WHY CLEAN THE HOUSE IF
NOBODY'S COMING OVER, RIGHT?

56
00:03:42,148 --> 00:03:45,964
>> THANK YOU, MS. RAFFERTY FOR
THAT DETAILED ACCOUNT.

57
00:03:45,964 --> 00:03:49,405
NOW, WHAT HAPPENED NEXT WITH THE
ENERGY BEINGS?

58
00:03:49,405 --> 00:03:54,116
>> WELL, THE ALIENS SHOWED US
HOW AN INFINITE NUMBER OF REALITIES

59
00:03:54,188 --> 00:03:56,130
CAN COEXIST AT ONCE.

60
00:03:56,130 --> 00:04:00,960
>> YEAH, AND, LIKE, HOW THE
DIFFERENT REALITIES CONVERGING IN ONE SPOT
WHERE

61
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:04,077
FOREVER

62
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:06,635
KIND OF
WHAT WE WOULD CALL HEAVEN.

63
00:04:06,635 --> 00:04:09,178
>> WHAT?

64
00:04:09,178 --> 00:04:15,242
ALL RIGHT, NO.
SO, THESE TWO ARE HANGING WITH
DOCTOR STRANGE AND THE MULTIVERSE,

65
00:04:15,242 --> 00:04:17,542
MEANWHILE, I'M STUCK
WITH THE MADNESS.

66
00:04:17,542 --> 00:04:23,306
BACK IN ECONOMY, WORD IS OUT
ABOUT MY HARRY FODDER.

67
00:04:23,307 --> 00:04:26,806
GRAYS

68
00:04:26,901 --> 00:04:32,594
THESE ARE POINTING AT MY DOWN
THERE HAIR, AND THEY'RE LIKE --
ELBOWING EACH OTHER LIKE,

69
00:04:32,594 --> 00:04:35,243
ARE
YOU GUYS SEEING THIS?

70
00:04:40,755 --> 00:04:45,061
>> SO, THE GROUP'S REACTION WAS
ONE OF EXCITEMENT?

71
00:04:45,061 --> 00:04:50,999
>> YEAH, LIKE WHEN A DOG -- LIKE
A DOG WHEN ITS OWNER COMES HOME
FROM WORK.

72
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:54,649
IT WAS BEDLAM, OKAY?
THEY'RE RUNNING AROUND,

73
00:04:54,649 --> 00:04:58,365
THEY'RE
WAVING THEIR ARMS LIKE KERMIT THE FROG

74
00:04:58,365 --> 00:05:02,020
MAKING WEIRD LITTLE
NOISES LIKE --

75
00:05:04,112 --> 00:05:07,710
AND THEN ONE OF THESE LITTLE
BASTARDS RUNS UP AND --

76
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:10,547
I'M SORRY, CARLA, I GOT TO USE
YOU HERE.

77
00:05:10,547 --> 00:05:14,413
PLUCKS ONE RIGHT OUT,

78
00:05:14,413 --> 00:05:16,033
STARTS SHOWING IT OFF.

79
00:05:16,033 --> 00:05:20,922
NOW, SUDDENLY MY CURLIES HAVE
BECOME THE MUST-HAVE ITEM OF THE SEASON,

80
00:05:20,922 --> 00:05:23,869
AND THEY'RE FLYING OFF
THE SHELF.

81
00:05:23,869 --> 00:05:28,844
THEY'RE GRABBING AND PLUCKING
AND GRABBING AND PLUCKING,

82
00:05:28,844 --> 00:05:32,537
CLIMBING ALL OVER EACH OTHER
LIKE MY BUSH

83
00:05:32,537 --> 00:05:36,003
IS THE LAST
LIFEBOAT ON THE "TITANIC."

84
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:40,416
>> AND WERE YOU UNSETTLED BY
THIS AT ALL?

85
00:05:40,416 --> 00:05:44,222
>> NO.
HONESTLY THE ENTIRE TIME, ALL I
COULD THINK WAS,

86
00:05:44,222 --> 00:05:48,804
DAMN, THAT
FORTUNE TELLER WAS DEAD ON.

87
00:05:48,954 --> 00:05:52,298
DID YOU GUYS GET ANY OF THAT
PUBE STUFF?

88
00:05:52,298 --> 00:05:54,815
>> NO, NO PUBE STUFF.
SORRY.

89
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:59,543
>> HEY, DON'T APOLOGIZE.
FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE I'M READY
FOR BIKINI SEASON.

90
00:05:59,618 --> 00:06:02,632
>> WOW.
AGAIN, VERY DETAILED.

91
00:06:02,632 --> 00:06:04,781
WELL, HOW WERE YOU RETURNED TO
EARTH?

92
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:07,702
>> THERE WAS ANOTHER SOFT LIGHT
THAT JUST WASHED OVER ME,

93
00:06:07,702 --> 00:06:10,509
AND I
WAS INSTANTLY BACK TO WHERE I
WAS BEFORE.

94
00:06:10,509 --> 00:06:13,961
>> OH, IT WAS LIKE WAKING UP
FROM AN AMAZING DREAM.

95
00:06:13,961 --> 00:06:17,089
>> OKAY, SEE, NOW, THAT REALLY
RIPS MY NIPS.

96
00:06:17,089 --> 00:06:22,272
BECAUSE I HAD TO CLIMB DOWN A GD
ROPE LADDER THAT WAS TOO SHORT, RIGHT

97
00:06:22,272 --> 00:06:26,162
SO I DROPPED 20 FEET AND
LAND ASS UP

98
00:06:26,162 --> 00:06:31,802
WITH MY DONG HOLE
AND WRONG HOLE OUT IN THE MIDDLE
OF A FIELD.

99
00:06:31,802 --> 00:06:34,519
>> AND WHAT HAPPENED NEXT?

100
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:37,783
>> THE UMPIRE CALLED TIMEOUT

101
00:06:37,783 --> 00:06:41,800
AND THE METS SECURITY STAFF TOOK ME
OUT OF THE STAND.

102
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:46,621
NOT THE MOST EMBARRASSING THING
I'VE DONE ON A JUMBOTRON.

103
00:06:46,621 --> 00:06:50,026
>> WELL, THAT WAS A RIVETING TESTIMONY,

104
00:06:50,026 --> 00:06:52,279
BUT THERE IS
SOMETHING YOU SHOULD ALL KNOW.

105
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:55,143
WE HAVE BEEN IN CONTACT WITH THE
BEINGS.

106
00:06:55,143 --> 00:07:00,250
>> THEY HAVE OFFERED THE U.S.
GOVERNMENT ACCESS TO SOME OF THEIR TECHNOLOGY

107
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:05,315
IF ONE OF YOU
AGREES TO GO WITH THEM
PERMANENTLY.

108
00:07:05,315 --> 00:07:08,477
>> WELL, I CAN READ THE ROOM.
IT'S ME, RIGHT?

109
00:07:08,477 --> 00:07:10,514
SURE.
WHY NOT?

110
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:13,998
I ALWAYS KIND OF FELT LIKE AN
ALIEN ON THIS PLANET ANYWAY.

111
00:07:39,421 --> 00:07:43,921
WELL, EARTH, I LOVE YOU.

112
00:07:43,921 --> 00:07:47,332
THANKS FOR LETTING ME STAY A
WHILE.

113
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:54,373
LIVE FROM NEW YORK, IT'S
SATURDAY NIGHT.

114
00:10:09,343 --> 00:10:13,769
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN --
NATASHA LYONNE!

115
00:10:35,271 --> 00:10:39,815
THANK

116
00:10:39,815 --> 00:10:42,222
MY NAME IS NATASHA LYONNE,

117
00:10:42,222 --> 00:10:46,406
AND I ALSO WISH I WAS HARRY STYLES.

118
00:10:47,570 --> 00:10:50,866
GOSH.
WILL YOU LOOK AT THIS?

119
00:10:50,866 --> 00:10:55,335
I'M HOSTING THE SEASON FINALE OF
SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE.

120
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:04,592
FOR A REAL NEW YORKER LIKE ME,
THAT'S BIG.

121
00:11:04,592 --> 00:11:07,937
I HAVE A SHOW CALLED "RUSSIAN
DOLL".

122
00:11:11,314 --> 00:11:14,588
THE SECOND SEASON OF "RUSSIAN
DOLL" JUST PREMIERED ON NETFLIX,

123
00:11:14,588 --> 00:11:17,553
AND TWO THINGS YOU DEFINITELY
WANT TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH RIGHT NOW

124
00:11:17,553 --> 00:11:20,726
ARE RUSSIA AND NETFLIX.

125
00:11:21,459 --> 00:11:26,019
YOU KNOW, IT'S MY FIRST TIME
HOSTING AND I'M GENUINELY
HUMBLED TO BE HERE.

126
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:30,074
THE TRUTH IS, I FEEL A COSMIC
CONNECTION TO "SNL."

127
00:11:30,074 --> 00:11:32,701
THE PEOPLE HERE ARE MY REAL-LIFE
CHOSEN FAMILY.

128
00:11:32,701 --> 00:11:34,931
I HAVE BEEN COMING HERE SINCE I
WAS A TEENAGER.

129
00:11:34,931 --> 00:11:37,204
I COCREATED "RUSSIAN DOLL" WITH
AMY POEHLER.

130
00:11:37,204 --> 00:11:39,909
AND I HAVE GREAT FRIENDS --

131
00:11:42,284 --> 00:11:45,961
FRED

132
00:11:52,442 --> 00:11:55,401
HEY.
HEY, ARE YOU BUSY?

133
00:11:55,401 --> 00:11:57,451
>> RIGHT NOW?
NO, NOT AT ALL.

134
00:11:57,451 --> 00:12:00,949
>> I THOUGHT WE COULD DO OUR
NATASHA LYONNE IMPRESSIONS FOR
YOU.

135
00:12:00,949 --> 00:12:04,764
>> WE DO GOOD IMPRESSIONS OF YOU
WHEN YOU'RE NOT AROUND.

136
00:12:07,604 --> 00:12:10,200
>> CONGRATULATIONS.
IPSO FACTO.

137
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,740
GOOD

138
00:12:12,337 --> 00:12:14,479
>> HOW ARE YOU?
ALL RIGHT.

139
00:12:14,479 --> 00:12:17,348
IT'S A DYNAMITE SWEATER.

140
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,762
COCKAROACH.

141
00:12:19,762 --> 00:12:23,450
BYE

142
00:12:27,229 --> 00:12:31,583
>> FREDDY AND I DATED FOR SEVEN
YEARS.

143
00:12:31,583 --> 00:12:35,130
WE'RE THE ONLY COUPLE WHO HAD A
SEX TAPE NOBODY WANTED TO BUY.

144
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:37,538
GOD, I LOVE THIS PLACE.

145
00:12:37,611 --> 00:12:40,349
SNL COMBINES EVERYTHING I LIKE --

146
00:12:40,349 --> 00:12:42,716
NEW YORK CITY, SHOW BUSINESS,

147
00:12:42,716 --> 00:12:45,735
PEOPLE WHO HAVE DONE
THE SAME THING SINCE THE '70s,

148
00:12:45,735 --> 00:12:48,341
AND DIFFERENT UNIONS FIGHTING.

149
00:12:48,341 --> 00:12:50,545
YEAH, I LOVE IT.

150
00:12:50,545 --> 00:12:53,954
I MEAN, I'M A NEW YORK CITY KID
AND A SHOWBIZ BABY.

151
00:12:53,954 --> 00:12:56,758
WEIRD STORY, BUT WHILE I HAVE
YOU, LISTEN TO THIS.

152
00:12:56,758 --> 00:12:59,127
SO, I'M BORN IN NEW YORK.

153
00:12:59,127 --> 00:13:02,237
DOESN'T MATTER WHAT YEAR.
EARLY '80s PROBABLY.

154
00:13:02,237 --> 00:13:04,471
EVERYTHING IS BROWN.

155
00:13:04,471 --> 00:13:08,176
MOST AUTOMOBILES ARE LONG AND
BANANA COLORED.

156
00:13:08,176 --> 00:13:12,146
MY PARENTS GET THIS BIG IDEA
THAT I HAVE A FUTURE IN SHOW BUSINESS,

157
00:13:12,146 --> 00:13:13,935
SO I START
AUDITIONING.

158
00:13:13,935 --> 00:13:18,034
A LOT OF CASTING MANAGERS ARE
LOOKING FOR A LITTLE ORPHAN ANNIE TYPE

159
00:13:18,034 --> 00:13:20,941
WHO TALKS LIKE
DEDERAMON.

160
00:13:20,941 --> 00:13:25,681
HERE'S A CLIP FROM ONE OF MY
EARLIEST ROLES.

161
00:13:28,222 --> 00:13:30,308
>> HI.

162
00:13:30,308 --> 00:13:32,048
>> HI, PEE WEE.

163
00:13:32,048 --> 00:13:35,013
>> WE'VE GOT A NEW MEMBER.
- HER NAME IS --

164
00:13:35,013 --> 00:13:37,438
>> HI.

165
00:13:37,438 --> 00:13:39,084
>> YEAH.

166
00:13:42,968 --> 00:13:46,097
I GOT TO SAY, MY BEST WORK TO
DATE.

167
00:13:46,097 --> 00:13:50,642
SO, I DO SOME TV.
MY MOM AND MOVED TO THE UPPER
EAST SIDE.

168
00:13:50,642 --> 00:13:52,144
SUDDENLY I'M IN THE MOVIES.

169
00:13:52,144 --> 00:13:57,375
I WAS IN ALL THOSE '90s MOVIES,
AMERICAN PIE, "AMERICAN PIE
2."

170
00:13:57,376 --> 00:14:00,850
AMERICAN

171
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:04,456
AND CULT FAVORITE "BUT I'M A
CHEERLEADER."

172
00:14:06,579 --> 00:14:10,864
SO, THINGS ARE GOING GREAT AND
KNOCK KNOCK, WHO'S THERE?

173
00:14:10,864 --> 00:14:13,238
MULTIPLE ARRESTS AND DRUG
ADDICTION.

174
00:14:13,238 --> 00:14:17,523
OH, YEAH, I WENT TO HELL AND
BACK.
LIFE WAS ROUGH.

175
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:21,287
BUT JUST LIKE WHEN FABIO WAS ON
THAT ROLLER COASTER

176
00:14:21,287 --> 00:14:23,884
AND THE BIRD FLEW INTO HIS FACE --

177
00:14:23,884 --> 00:14:26,393
HEY, DO WE
HAVE A PHOTO OF THAT?

178
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:33,681
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
JUST LIKE WHEN FABIO, WHEN THAT HAPPENED,

179
00:14:33,681 --> 00:14:39,350
I BRUSHED MYSELF OFF
AND I GOT BACK ON THE RIDE.

180
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:45,523
AND NOW I'M HERE.

181
00:14:45,523 --> 00:14:48,437
ALL RIGHT?
SURE, I'M CONFLATING EVENTS,

182
00:14:48,437 --> 00:14:52,029
GLOSSING OVER ENTIRE DECADES,
BUT I'M HERE.

183
00:14:52,029 --> 00:14:54,046
AND I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I FOUND.

184
00:14:54,046 --> 00:14:56,606
THERE'S ALWAYS HOPE IN THIS AND DESPAIR

185
00:14:56,606 --> 00:15:01,917
AND THERE'S ALWAYS A
REASON TO GET BACK IN THE RING
AND FIGHT ANOTHER DAY.

186
00:15:02,129 --> 00:15:06,304
WE GOT A GREAT SHOW.
JAPANESE BREAKFAST IS HERE.

187
00:15:06,304 --> 00:15:09,536
STICK AROUND AND WE'LL BE RIGHT
BACK.

188
00:15:18,852 --> 00:15:21,454
STUPID.

189
00:15:18,852 --> 00:15:21,454
>> HI.

190
00:15:18,852 --> 00:15:21,454
I'M JOANN.

191
00:15:21,454 --> 00:15:25,191
AND FOR AS LONG AS I CAN

192
00:15:21,454 --> 00:15:25,191
REMEMBER, I'VE BEEN A STUPID

193
00:15:21,454 --> 00:15:25,191
PERSON.

194
00:15:25,191 --> 00:15:29,396
>> I'M TIM, AND MY PARENTS ARE

195
00:15:25,191 --> 00:15:29,396
BOTH STUPID.

196
00:15:25,191 --> 00:15:29,396
I'M STUPID, AND MY GRANDSON IS

197
00:15:29,396 --> 00:15:36,803
STUPID.

198
00:15:29,396 --> 00:15:36,803
>> NEARLY 1 IN 5 U.S. ADULTS

199
00:15:29,396 --> 00:15:36,803
LIVE WITH A MENTAL ILLNESS OR

200

THEY CHECKED.

204
00:15:39,973 --> 00:15:43,143
>> I'M JUST PLAIN STUPID.

205
00:15:39,973 --> 00:15:43,143
>> I ALWAYS KNEW I WAS

206
00:15:43,143 --> 00:15:46,846
DIFFERENT.

207
00:15:43,143 --> 00:15:46,846
THINGS THAT WERE OBVIOUS TO

208
00:15:43,143 --> 00:15:46,846
EVERYONE ELSE WERE ALWAYS VERY

209
00:15:46,846 --> 00:15:52,852
COMPLICATED FOR ME.

210
00:15:46,846 --> 00:15:52,852
>> JOKES HAVE TO BE EXPLAINED.

211
00:15:46,846 --> 00:15:52,852
MOVIES HAVE TO BE EXPLAINED.

212
00:15:52,852 --> 00:15:58,992
FOODS HAVE TO BE EXPLAINED.

213
00:15:52,852 --> 00:15:58,992
SLOWLY.

214
00:15:52,852 --> 00:15:58,992
>> I DON'T NEED THIS THING.

215
00:15:58,992 --> 00:16:05,832
I JUST THOUGHT IT SOUNDED COOL.

216
00:15:58,992 --> 00:16:05,832
I GUESS THAT'S STUPID.

217
00:15:58,992 --> 00:16:05,832
>> MOST PEOPLE, LIKE ME, GO

218

219

>> THAT WAS FIRE, CASSIE MARIE.

510
00:25:19,853 --> 00:25:23,556

THAT'S BETWEEN US, TREECE.

00:25:32,298 --> 00:25:40,540
HARD IN THE CAR.

519
00:25:32,298 --> 00:25:40,540
>> OKAY, TREECE, I DON'T WANT TO

520
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:43,076
TALK ABOUT THAT HERE.

521
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:43,076
MY TEARS ARE MY BUSINESS.

522
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:43,076

523
00:25:43,076 --> 00:25:45,979

524
00:25:43,076 --> 00:25:45,979
EMOTIONAL STATE.

>> ALL RIGHT.

534
00:25:59,926 --> 00:26:02,529
HOW IS EVERYBODY DOING TONIGHT?

535
00:26:02,529 --> 00:26:10,670
HOW ABOUT YOU, LOVELY COUPLE?

536
00:26:02,529 --> 00:26:10,670
>> OH, WE'RE NOT A COUPLE.

537
00:26:02,529 --> 00:26:10,670
I'M GAY AND SHE'S MY PSYCHIC.

538
00:26:10,670 --> 00:26:15,575

>> I KNEW IT.

544
00:26:18,044 --> 00:26:23,950
SPILL THE BEANS, CASSIE MARIE.

545
00:26:18,044 --> 00:26:23,950
>> OH, HO!

546
00:26:18,044 --> 00:26:23,950
THERE IS NOTHING TO SPILL, AND

547
00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:29,756
THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS

548
00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:29,756
PSYCHICS.

549
00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:29,756
>> IT'S SOMEONE WITH AN "R"

550
00:26:29,756 --> 00:26:33,727
NAME.

551
00:26:29,756 --> 00:26:33,727
>> WHAT?

552
00:26:29,756 --> 00:26:33,727
SO THERE'S A "R" IN YOUR LIFE?

553
00:26:33,727 --> 00:26:38,465
IS IT R. KELLY?

554
00:26:33,727 --> 00:26:38,465
STEER CLEAR.

555
00:26:33,727 --> 00:26:38,465
>> THERE'S NO R. KELLY.

556
00:26:38,465 --> 00:26:42,635

**

562
00:26:46,873 --> 00:26:54,280
>> TREECE, I'M SORRY TO

563
00:26:46,873 --> 00:26:54,280
INTERRUPT, BUT CASSIE IS ABOUT

564
00:26:46,873 --> 00:26:54,280
TO RECEIVE A NEST CAM ALERT.

565
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:56,649
>> WHAT?

566
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:56,649
PULL OUT YOUR PHONE.

567
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:56,649
>> TREECE, YOU'RE KILLING THE

568
00:26:56,649 --> 00:26:58,752
VIBE.

569
00:26:56,649 --> 00:26:58,752
>> JUST DO IT.

570
00:26:58,752 --> 00:27:00,887
IT'S YOUR NEST CAM.

571
00:26:58,752 --> 00:27:00,887
THERE'S SOMEONE IN YOUR FRONT

572
00:26:58,752 --> 00:27:00,887
YARD.

573
00:27:00,887 --> 00:27:04,057
SHE WAS RIGHT AGAIN.

574
00:27:00,887 --> 00:27:04,057
>> YOU TWO!

575
00:27:00,887 --> 00:27:04,057
GET OUT OF HERE WITH YOUR DEVIL

576
00:27:04,057 --> 00:27:06,693
BUSINESS!

577
00:27:04,057 --> 00:27:06,693
>> OH, NO, I PAID $4 FOR BOTH OF

578
00:27:04,057 --> 00:27:06,693
THESE SEATS.

579
00:27:06,693 --> 00:27:12,032
WE'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE, HONEY.

580
00:27:06,693 --> 00:27:12,032
>> WHO IS THAT IN YOUR YARD?

581
00:27:06,693 --> 00:27:12,032
HE'S WEARING A T-SHIRT THAT SAYS

582
00:27:12,032 --> 00:27:21,374
RONALD.

583
00:27:12,032 --> 00:27:21,374

584
00:27:12,032 --> 00:27:21,374
>> YES, IT'S MY EX, RONALD.

585
00:27:21,374 --> 00:27:30,183
>> WELL, THAT EXPLAINS THE TEE.

586
00:27:21,374 --> 00:27:30,183
WAIT, WHAT'S HE DOING NOW?

587
00:27:21,374 --> 00:27:30,183
>> HE'S IN THE CLOSET BEDROOM.

588
00:27:30,183 --> 00:27:33,520
>> WHAT?

589
00:27:30,183 --> 00:27:33,520
BUT THAT'S MY CLOSET BEDROOM.

590
00:27:30,183 --> 00:27:33,520
THAT'S WHERE I PUT MY

591
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:39,859
FASHIONWARE.

592
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:39,859
>> HE MUST THINK THEY'RE MINE.

593
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:39,859
HE'S GOING TO BURN THEM TO GET

594
00:27:39,859 --> 00:27:42,195
ME BACK FOR DUMPING HIM.

595
00:27:39,859 --> 00:27:42,195
>> OH, NO, HE HAS MY BOTTEGA

596
00:27:39,859 --> 00:27:42,195
VENETA FANNY PACK.

597
00:27:42,195 --> 00:27:51,104
YOU CAN'T BURN THAT!

598
00:27:42,195 --> 00:27:51,104
THAT'S MY BOTTEGA VENETA.

599
00:27:42,195 --> 00:27:51,104
>> BUT IT'S A KNOCKOFF, TREECE.

600
00:27:51,104 --> 00:27:55,342
>> OH, YOU SHUT UP!

601
00:27:51,104 --> 00:27:55,342
>> TREECE, THEY'RE JUST CLOTHES.

602
00:27:51,104 --> 00:27:55,342
>> YOU'RE JUST CLOTHES.

603
00:27:55,342 --> 00:28:02,682
AND HER EX-BOYFRIEND IS ABOUT TO

604
00:27:55,342 --> 00:28:02,682
ANGELA BASSETT MY BOTTEGA VENETA

605
00:27:55,342 --> 00:28:02,682
AND SET IT ON FIRE AND WALK AWAY

606
00:28:02,682 --> 00:28:05,819
AND SNAP.

607
00:28:02,682 --> 00:28:05,819
NOW, CALL HIM AND TELL HIM TO

608
00:28:02,682 --> 00:28:05,819
STOP.

609
00:28:05,819 --> 00:28:11,191
>> OKAY, JUST FOR YOU, TREECE.

610
00:28:05,819 --> 00:28:11,191
HELLO, RONALD.

611
00:28:05,819 --> 00:28:11,191
WHAT DID YOU SAY TO ME?

612
00:28:11,191 --> 00:28:19,265
NO, YOU'RE GARBAGE!

613
00:28:11,191 --> 00:28:19,265
I DON'T CARE.

614
00:28:11,191 --> 00:28:19,265
BURN EVERY PIECE OF CLOTHING IN

615
00:28:19,265 --> 00:28:23,403
THAT ROOM IF YOU WANT!

616
00:28:19,265 --> 00:28:23,403
>> NO!

617
00:28:19,265 --> 00:28:23,403
THAT WAS NOT THE PLAN.

618
00:28:23,403 --> 00:28:26,039
>> I'M SORRY, TREECE.

619
00:28:23,403 --> 00:28:26,039
I'LL BUY YOU ALL NEW STUFF

620
00:28:23,403 --> 00:28:26,039
TOMORROW.

621
00:28:26,039 --> 00:28:34,114
>> YOU CAN'T.

622
00:28:26,039 --> 00:28:34,114
YOU'RE POORER THAN ME.

623
00:28:26,039 --> 00:28:34,114

628
00:28:38,852 --> 00:28:46,059

**

630
00:28:51,564 --> 00:28:55,769

COME TO AN END, INCLUDING THIS

632
00:28:51,564 --> 00:28:55,769
PROM.

633
00:28:55,769 --> 00:28:59,439
BUT WE'VE GOT A COUPLE SONGS

634
00:28:55,769 --> 00:28:59,439

635
00:28:55,769 --> 00:28:59,439
SO LET'S MAKE THEM COUNT.

**

639
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:12,452
>> HARD TO BELIEVE IT'S BEEN

640
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:12,452
20 YEARS SINCE THAT NIGHT.

641
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:12,452
AFTER GRADUATION, WE ALL WENT

642
00:29:12,452 --> 00:29:17,724
OUR SEPARATE WAYS, BUT I STILL

643
00:29:12,452 --> 00:29:17,724
LIKE TO THINK ABOUT MY OLD

644
00:29:12,452 --> 00:29:17,724
FRIENDS AND SMILE.

645
00:29:17,724 --> 00:29:25,665
SHELLY HINES GRADUATED FIRST IN

646
00:29:17,724 --> 00:29:25,665
OUR CLASS, THEN WENT TO HARVARD,

647
00:29:17,724 --> 00:29:25,665
WHERE SHE GRADUATED DEAD LAST.

648
00:29:25,665 --> 00:29:31,705
I GUESS OUR HIGH SCHOOL JUST

649
00:29:25,665 --> 00:29:31,705
WASN'T THAT GOOD.

650
00:29:25,665 --> 00:29:31,705
TESSA WHITE GOT MARRIED AND HAD

651
00:29:31,705 --> 00:29:40,246
TWO BEAUTIFUL DAUGHTERS.

652
00:29:31,705 --> 00:29:40,246
AND ONE FAT UGLY SON.

653
00:29:31,705 --> 00:29:40,246
AS FOR RACHEL FINSTER, WELL, THE

654
00:29:40,246 --> 00:29:44,150
LESS SAID ABOUT HER THE BETTER.

662
00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:54,494
SHE SHOULD HAVE BEEN HAPPY, BUT

663
00:29:54,494 --> 00:30:02,702
SHE NEVER GOT OVER RACHEL

664
00:29:54,494 --> 00:30:02,702
FINSTER SLEEPING WITH HER DAD.

665

00:30:02,702 --> 00:30:06,940
HE'S WORKED WITH ALL THE GREATS,

669
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:17,417
EVEN RACHEL FINSTER.

670
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:17,417
>> AS FOR CARLY HILL, SHE MOVED

671
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:17,417

672

676
00:30:24,791 --> 00:30:28,461
UNFORTUNATELY, HE ONLY DREAMED

677
00:30:24,791 --> 00:30:28,461
ABOUT KILLING HIS GRANDPARENTS.

678
00:30:28,461 --> 00:30:36,369
DOUGIE FINNEGAN NEVER STOPPED

INVENTING THINGS, AND EVENTUALLY

680
00:30:28,461 --> 00:30:36,369
ONE OF THOSE INVENTIONS MADE HIM

681
00:30:36,369 --> 00:30:42,542
RICH.

682
00:30:36,369 --> 00:30:42,542

686
00:30:42,542 --> 00:30:46,146
ROBBIE MADE A VOW TO LOSE THEIR

00:30:46,146 --> 00:30:52,485
TO THE DEEJAY.

690
00:30:52,485 --> 00:30:59,325
SOME PEOPLE HAD HAPPIER STORIES,

691
00:30:52,485 --> 00:30:59,325
LIKE NATALIE TURNER, WHO WAS

692
00:30:52,485 --> 00:30:59,325
GRANTED THE FIRST GAY MARRIAGE

694
00:30:59,325 --> 00:31:05,265
WE ALL WENT TO THE WEDDING, EVEN

695
00:30:59,325 --> 00:31:05,265

SEVEN YEARS LATER, JEFF AHMED

699
00:31:12,072 --> 00:31:16,443
REACHED OUT TO RACHEL TO TRY TO

700
00:31:12,072 --> 00:31:16,443
TALK SENSE AND HER, AND IT

701
00:31:12,072 --> 00:31:16,443
WORKED.

702
00:31:16,443 --> 00:31:21,381
THEY STARTED DATING AND MOVED IN

703
00:31:16,443 --> 00:31:21,381
TOGETHER.

704
00:31:16,443 --> 00:31:21,381
HIS BODY WAS NEVER FOUND.

705
00:31:21,381 --> 00:31:29,356
SOME OF OUR FRIENDS SURPRISED

706
00:31:21,381 --> 00:31:29,356
US.

707
00:31:21,381 --> 00:31:29,356
CARLA ANDRETTI FOLLOWED HER

708
00:31:29,356 --> 00:31:37,263
MOTHER'S FOOTSTEPS ALL THE WAY

709

JANUARY 6th.

711
00:31:37,263 --> 00:31:41,368
HOW CAN WE FORGET AMY FULTON?

712
00:31:37,263 --> 00:31:41,368
I'M NOT SURE HOW, BUT WE ALL

713
00:31:37,263 --> 00:31:41,368

714
00:31:41,368 --> 00:31:44,270
JUST COMPLETELY FORGOT ABOUT HER

715
00:31:41,368 --> 00:31:44,270
LIKE SHE DIDN'T EXIST.

716
00:31:41,368 --> 00:31:44,270
THEN THERE'S PETER LIU, WHO LEFT

717
00:31:44,270 --> 00:31:50,176
A HUGE MARK ON BROADWAY AFTER HE

AFTER THE DOG, THE MOUNTAIN LION
WAS WAY TOO FULL TO EAT ANYTHING
ELSE.

SKINNY KID AND NO ONE KNEW WHAT
RACE I WAS.

1085
00:50:27,033 --> 00:50:28,915
LIKE NOW, EVERYONE KNOWS I'M WHITE

1086
00:50:28,974 --> 00:50:33,522
BECAUSE I BECAME HUGELY
SUCCESSFUL WHILE BARELY SHOWING
UP TO WORK.

1087
00:50:33,522 --> 00:50:36,954
AND LIKE, LOOK AT ME NOW.
I'M AGING LIKE AN OLD BANANA,

1088
00:50:36,954 --> 00:50:41,388
AND COLIN STILL LOOKS LIKE THE
ONLY KENNEDY WHO DOESN'T DRINK.

>> HAS A LOT CHANGED SINCE YOU
STARTED HERE?

1093
00:50:58,222 --> 00:51:01,838
>> A LOT HAS CHANGED.
IN THREE YEARS
FOX NEWS WENT

1094
00:51:01,838 --> 00:51:06,644
FROM CALLING ME A MONSTER FOR
MAKING FUN OF CONGRESSMAN DAN
CRENSHAW'S EYE PATCH

1095
00:51:06,644 --> 00:51:09,938
TO ALSO
MAKING FUN OF HIS EYE PATCH.

1096
00:51:09,938 --> 00:51:13,377
TUCKER CARLSON CALLED HIM EYE
PATCH McCAIN.

1097
00:51:13,377 --> 00:51:15,683
THAT'S TWO VETERAN INSULTS IN
ONE.

1098
00:51:15,683 --> 00:51:18,597
YOUR DAD'S A DICK.

1099

CARLSON.

>> LEARN SOMETHING EVERY DAY.

1101
00:51:27,524 --> 00:51:33,257
IN FAIRNESS, WHAT I SAID,
BECAUSE IT STILL BOTHERS ME,

1102
00:51:33,257 --> 00:51:37,358
I WAS MAKING A JOKE ABOUT
SOMEONE'S EXPERIENCE

1103
00:51:37,463 --> 00:51:41,035
WITHOUT
REALIZING THE MEDICAL CONDITION
BEHIND IT WAS A SENSITIVE ISSUE,

1104
00:51:41,105 --> 00:51:44,080
WHICH IS A "SNL" TRADITION.

1105
00:51:48,468 --> 00:51:53,148
ON ONE HAND I DON'T LIKE A GUY
RUNS UP ON STAGE.

1106
00:51:53,148 --> 00:51:57,353
MY CHOSE WILL BE SOLD OUT.

1107
00:51:57,353 --> 00:52:00,485
>> IS THERE ANYTHING YOU'RE
GOING TO MISS?

1108
00:52:00,485 --> 00:52:02,720
>> LORNE FOR SURE.

1109
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:04,419
HE'S LED US THROUGH THE COVID
ERA.

1110
00:52:04,419 --> 00:52:08,649
THE ONLY TIME HE WEARS A MASK IS
AT HIS "EYES WIDE SHUT" PARTIES.

1111
00:52:14,323 --> 00:52:16,385
NO, HE REALLY ALWAYS GIVES ME
THE BEST ADVICE.

1112
00:52:16,385 --> 00:52:18,946
THIS IS ALL TRUE.

1113
00:52:18,946 --> 00:52:22,899
I'LL NEVER FORGET.
I CALLED HIM WHEN I GOT ENGAGED.

1114
00:52:22,991 --> 00:52:27,219
I WAS LIKE, "LORNE, I JUST GOT
ENGAGED TO ARIANA GRANDE AFTER
DATING HER FOR TWO WEEKS."

1115
00:52:27,219 --> 00:52:30,665
HE GOES, "OH, HOLD ON FOR DEAR
LIFE."

1116
00:52:31,278 --> 00:52:33,780
IT'S A TRUE STORY.

1117
00:52:33,780 --> 00:52:38,328
AND THEN WHEN I AUDITIONED FOR SNL HE SAID,

1118
00:52:38,328 --> 00:52:41,917
I DON'T THINK
YOU'RE RIGHT FOR THIS SHOW,

1119
00:52:41,917 --> 00:52:44,777
SO
LET'S SCREW THIS UP TOGETHER.

1120
00:52:44,777 --> 00:52:48,615
AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE DID.
AND THAT'S WHY PEOPLE WHO DON'T
THINK I DESERVE THE JOB

1121
00:52:48,615 --> 00:52:51,105
SHOULDN'T REALLY HATE ME SINCE
WE HAVE SO MUCH IN COMMON.

1122
00:52:51,105 --> 00:52:53,821
LIKE, IF ANYTHING, I SHOULD
INSPIRE HOPE

1123
00:52:53,821 --> 00:52:57,795
THAT LITERALLY
ANYONE CAN BE ON "SATURDAY NIGHT
LIVE."

1124
00:52:57,795 --> 00:53:01,829
SERIOUSLY, YOU SEE A GUY BUMMING
CIGARETTES OUTSIDE A 7-ELEVEN AT 2:00 A.M.,

1125
00:53:01,829 --> 00:53:05,366
THAT'S NOT SOME METH
HEAD, THAT'S THE NEXT
PETE DAVIDSON.

1126
00:53:05,542 --> 00:53:07,456
>> I'M GOING TO MISS YOU, PETE.

1127
00:53:07,544 --> 00:53:11,403
>> THANKS, COLIN, EVEN THOUGH I
KNOW IT'S ON YOUR CUE CARD.

1128
00:53:11,403 --> 00:53:13,580
YOU HAVE BEEN LIKE A BROTHER TO ME,

1129
00:53:13,580 --> 00:53:17,885
IN THAT MY MOM LOVES YOU
MORE.

1130
00:53:17,885 --> 00:53:20,787
>> I APPRECIATE "SNL,"

1131

1132
00:53:23,349 --> 00:53:27,457
LORN FOR NEVER GIVING UP ON ME AND

OTHER

1134
00:53:29,372 --> 00:53:33,381
BELIEVING IN ME AND ALLOWING ME
TO HAVE A PLACE THAT, LIKE, I
COULD CALL HOME

1135
00:53:33,381 --> 00:53:35,987
WITH MEMORIES
THAT WILL LAST A LIFETIME

1136
00:53:35,987 --> 00:53:36,937
SO
THANK YOU GUYS.

1137
00:53:36,937 --> 00:53:39,327
>> PETE DAVIDSON, EVERYONE.

1138
00:53:54,100 --> 00:54:02,042
NOT CLASSIC, "9:15 TO 5:10."

1139

00:54:02,042 --> 00:54:07,313
>> YEAH, MR. DOOLEY'S A GRADE-A

1142
00:54:02,042 --> 00:54:07,313
BIGOT AND MISOGYNIST.

1143
00:54:02,042 --> 00:54:07,313
>> BUT IS HE NICE?

1144
00:54:07,313 --> 00:54:12,619
>> HE'S THE EXACT OPPOSITE OF

1145
00:54:07,313 --> 00:54:12,619
NICE.

1146
00:54:07,313 --> 00:54:12,619
SOMEONE OUGHT TO KILL HIM.

1147
00:54:12,619 --> 00:54:16,856
>> BUT HE'S OUR BOSS AND IT'S

1148
00:54:12,619 --> 00:54:16,856
1981 AND WE'RE THREE WOMEN.

1149
00:54:12,619 --> 00:54:16,856
>> AND SOMEONE OUGHT TO KILL

1150
00:54:16,856 --> 00:54:24,464
HIM.

1151
00:54:16,856 --> 00:54:24,464
COME ON.

1152
00:54:16,856 --> 00:54:24,464
>> MR. DOOLEY, ARE YOU DECENT?

1153
00:54:24,464 --> 00:54:29,536
>> OH, IN THE SACK?

1154
00:54:24,464 --> 00:54:29,536
YEAH, I DO OKAY, BUT JUST GIVE

1155
00:54:24,464 --> 00:54:29,536
ME A SECOND TO BUTTON EVERYTHING

1156
00:54:29,536 --> 00:54:41,881
BACK UP.

1157
00:54:29,536 --> 00:54:41,881
>> OH, MY GOD, DID YOU JUST

1158
00:54:29,536 --> 00:54:41,881
SHOOT MR. DOOLEY?

1159
00:54:41,881 --> 00:54:46,186
HE BARELY SAID A LINE.

1160
00:54:41,881 --> 00:54:46,186
>> WELL, YOU SAID YOU WANTED HIM

1161
00:54:41,881 --> 00:54:46,186
DEAD, SO I DID.

1162
00:54:46,186 --> 00:54:49,723
>> WHERE DID YOU GET THAT GUN

1163
00:54:46,186 --> 00:54:49,723
EVEN?

1164
00:54:46,186 --> 00:54:49,723
>> MY HUSBAND GAVE IT TO ME,

1165
00:54:49,723 --> 00:54:52,892
IN CASE I SEE A DEER IN THE

1166
00:54:49,723 --> 00:54:52,892
STREET.

1167
00:54:49,723 --> 00:54:52,892
>> BUT NOW WHAT DO WE DO?

1168
00:54:52,892 --> 00:54:56,096
THE SHAREHOLDER MEETING IS IN

1169
00:54:52,892 --> 00:54:56,096
TEN MINUTES.

1170
00:54:52,892 --> 00:54:56,096
>> ARE WE SURE HE'S DEAD?

1171
00:54:56,096 --> 00:54:58,698
I MEAN YOUR PISTOL'S SO TINY.

1172
00:54:56,096 --> 00:54:58,698
>> WELL, THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY TO

1173
00:54:56,096 --> 00:54:58,698
FIND OUT.

1174
00:54:58,698 --> 00:55:04,037
LET'S TICKLE HIM.

1175
00:54:58,698 --> 00:55:04,037
>> WHAT?

1176
00:54:58,698 --> 00:55:04,037
TICKLE A DEAD GUY?

1177
00:55:04,037 --> 00:55:09,509
>> WE DON'T KNOW HE'S DEAD,

1178
00:55:04,037 --> 00:55:09,509
NOT UNTIL WE TICKLE HIM.

1179
00:55:04,037 --> 00:55:09,509
>> OKAY.

1180
00:55:09,509 --> 00:55:18,585
HERE GOES NOTHING.

1181
00:55:09,509 --> 00:55:18,585
>> TICKLE, TICKLE, TICKLE,

1182
00:55:09,509 --> 00:55:18,585
TICKLE!

1183
00:55:18,585 --> 00:55:22,589
>> TICKLE, TICKLE!

1184
00:55:18,585 --> 00:55:22,589
>> YEAH, WELL, HE DIDN'T EVEN

1185
00:55:18,585 --> 00:55:22,589
MOVE.

1186
00:55:22,589 --> 00:55:27,927
NOT EVEN A LITTLE, SO I GUESS HE

1187
00:55:22,589 --> 00:55:27,927
IS DEAD.

1188
00:55:22,589 --> 00:55:27,927
>> WHAT DO YOU THINK WE SHOULD

1189
00:55:27,927 --> 00:55:32,399
DO?

1190
00:55:27,927 --> 00:55:32,399
>> I THINK -- OH, NO, THE

1191
00:55:27,927 --> 00:55:32,399
SHAREHOLDERS ARE COMING.

1192
00:55:32,399 --> 00:55:34,467
>> WELL, SHOULD WE CUT UP HIS

1193
00:55:32,399 --> 00:55:34,467
BODY AND BURN IT?

1194
00:55:32,399 --> 00:55:34,467
>> THERE'S NO TIME.

1195
00:55:34,467 --> 00:55:46,579
THEY'RE HERE.

1196
00:55:34,467 --> 00:55:46,579
FOLLOW MY LEAD.

1197
00:55:34,467 --> 00:55:46,579
>> DOOLEY.

1198
00:55:46,579 --> 00:55:48,848
GOOD TO SEE YOU, OLD

1199
00:55:46,579 --> 00:55:48,848
CHEESEBURGER.

1200
00:55:46,579 --> 00:55:48,848
I HOPE YOU HAVE SOME GOOD NEWS

1201
00:55:48,848 --> 00:55:55,689
FOR US.

1202
00:55:48,848 --> 00:55:55,689
>> YEAH, WHAT ARE YOUR NUMBERS

1203
00:55:48,848 --> 00:55:55,689
THIS QUARTER?

1204
00:55:55,689 --> 00:56:02,395
>> OH, BIG HIGH NUMBERS.

1205
00:55:55,689 --> 00:56:02,395
I LIKE TO SEE THAT.

1206
00:55:55,689 --> 00:56:02,395
>> I LIKE IT, TOO.

1207
00:56:02,395 --> 00:56:04,497
BUT WHY ARE THE WOMEN RAISING

1208
00:56:02,395 --> 00:56:04,497
YOUR ARMS?

1209
00:56:02,395 --> 00:56:04,497
>> WHO, US?

1210
00:56:04,497 --> 00:56:08,201
WE'RE NOT WOMEN.

1211
00:56:04,497 --> 00:56:08,201
>> NO, WE ARE WOMEN.

1212
00:56:04,497 --> 00:56:08,201
WE'RE JUST NOT HERE.

1213
00:56:08,201 --> 00:56:10,837
>> NO, WE'RE HERE.

1214
00:56:08,201 --> 00:56:10,837
IT'S JUST THAT BEHIND EVERY

1215
00:56:08,201 --> 00:56:10,837
GREAT MAN ARE THREE DUMB WOMEN

1216
00:56:10,837 --> 00:56:18,178
MOVING HIS ARMS AROUND, RIGHT?

1217
00:56:10,837 --> 00:56:18,178
>> GOOD ONE, DOOLEY.

1218
00:56:18,178 --> 00:56:23,383
>> COME ON, DOOLEY, LAUGH WITH

1219
00:56:18,178 --> 00:56:23,383
US.

1220
00:56:18,178 --> 00:56:23,383
>> OH, WELL, MR. DOOLEY LOVES TO

1221
00:56:23,383 --> 00:56:28,488
LAUGH.

1222
00:56:23,383 --> 00:56:28,488
>> CLASSIC DOOLEY.

1223
00:56:23,383 --> 00:56:28,488
NEEDS THREE WOMEN TO MAKE HIM

1224
00:56:28,488 --> 00:56:31,624
LAUGH.

1225
00:56:28,488 --> 00:56:31,624
>> WAIT, THAT DOESN'T MAKE

1226
00:56:28,488 --> 00:56:31,624
SENSE.

1227
00:56:31,624 --> 00:56:36,930
WOMEN AREN'T FUNNY.

1228
00:56:31,624 --> 00:56:36,930
HE'S NOT DEAD, IS HE?

1229
00:56:31,624 --> 00:56:36,930
>> DEAD?

1230
00:56:36,930 --> 00:56:42,669
HARDLY.

1231
00:56:36,930 --> 00:56:42,669
I MEAN, LOOK AT THIS DOG.

1232
00:56:36,930 --> 00:56:42,669
HIS HANDS ARE ALL OVER OUR

1233
00:56:42,669 --> 00:56:54,547
BODIES.

1234
00:56:42,669 --> 00:56:54,547
>> OH, MR. DOOLEY!

1235
00:56:42,669 --> 00:56:54,547
>> THAT'S GOOD FUN.

1236
00:56:54,547 --> 00:56:58,318
HEY, HOW ABOUT A DRINK, DOOLEY?

1237
00:56:54,547 --> 00:56:58,318
>> YEAH, IT'S 11:00 A.M.

1238
00:56:54,547 --> 00:56:58,318
SOMEWHERE.

1239
00:56:58,318 --> 00:57:02,022
>> A DRINK?

1240
00:56:58,318 --> 00:57:02,022
MR. DOOLEY MAKES GREAT DRINKS AT

1241
00:56:58,318 --> 00:57:02,022
THAT BAR ACROSS THE ROOM.

1242
00:57:02,022 --> 00:57:06,393
>> HERE WE GO.

1243
00:57:02,022 --> 00:57:06,393
>> OKAY.

1244
00:57:02,022 --> 00:57:06,393
>> WHY IS HE STAYING IN THAT

1245
00:57:06,393 --> 00:57:12,399
CHAIR?

1246
00:57:06,393 --> 00:57:12,399
>> OH, UH, BECAUSE HE JUST GOT A

1247
00:57:06,393 --> 00:57:12,399
COLONOSCOPY.

1248
00:57:12,399 --> 00:57:16,936
>> YEAH, AND THEY LEFT THE TUBE

1249
00:57:12,399 --> 00:57:16,936
IN.

1250
00:57:12,399 --> 00:57:16,936
>> OH, THAT'S THE WORST.

1251
00:57:16,936 --> 00:57:28,515

1252
00:57:16,936 --> 00:57:28,515
DRINK.

1253
00:57:16,936 --> 00:57:28,515
>> CAN WE OFFER YOU A MAI TAI?

1254
00:57:28,515 --> 00:57:33,920
>> BREAKING A LOT OF BOTTLES

1255
00:57:28,515 --> 00:57:33,920
THERE, OLD DOOLEY.

1256
00:57:28,515 --> 00:57:33,920

1257
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:45,432
>> OKAY, HERE THEY ARE.

1258
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:45,432

>> MAI THAIS.

1260
00:57:45,432 --> 00:57:54,074

YOU'RE ALL OVER ME.

1262
00:57:45,432 --> 00:57:54,074
>> THANK YOU.

WAIT -- WAIT A SECOND.

1264
00:57:54,074 --> 00:57:59,446
SOMETHING'S OFF HERE.

00:57:59,446 --> 00:58:08,888
IN HIS HAND.

1268
00:57:59,446 --> 00:58:08,888
>> THAT'S 'CAUSE HE'S DEAD!

1269
00:58:08,888 --> 00:58:16,429
DEAD ON WITH THIS MAI TAI.

1270

JUST IN CASE HE IS DEAD, I'M

1273
00:58:16,429 --> 00:58:21,534

NOW, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE US, WE'RE

1285
00:58:40,420 --> 00:58:48,795

1289
00:58:48,795 --> 00:58:51,431
NOT THE DOOR.
