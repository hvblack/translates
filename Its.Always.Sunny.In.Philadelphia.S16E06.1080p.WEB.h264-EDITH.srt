1
00:00:21,422 --> 00:00:24,164
That hits.
-I am so psyched
that we're going back.
-[grunts]

2
00:00:24,164 --> 00:00:28,298
Yeah, yes.
You guys, I mean, arcade games,
pizza, comedy.

3
00:00:28,298 --> 00:00:29,564
-What more
do you want in a place?
-You can't beat it.

4
00:00:29,564 --> 00:00:33,747
The best part about
Risk E. Rat's, though,
is that they make kids feel
like they're the ones in charge.

5
00:00:33,747 --> 00:00:37,902
Totally.
Like, that's where
I became a man
and saw my first set of boobies,
at Risk E.'s.

6
00:00:37,902 --> 00:00:39,365
-Really?
-Uh-huh.
-Wait, what?

7
00:00:39,365 --> 00:00:40,885
Wait a minute. Hold on.
I don't know about this.

8
00:00:40,885 --> 00:00:45,735
Oh, yeah, dude,
Justine the Teen Dream.
She was one of the robots in
the Animatronic No Rules Band.

9
00:00:45,735 --> 00:00:46,885
-You guys remember that?
-Yeah, of course.

10
00:00:46,885 --> 00:00:49,960
Right, so if you got off
the Train to Kid City
and you snuck backstage,

11
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:53,103
you could see under her shirt
just before she came out
to perform.

12
00:00:53,103 --> 00:00:56,208
-Uh, yeah, I remember
hearing about that,
but I thought that was
just a legend.

13
00:00:56,208 --> 00:00:57,269
-That's real, dude.
-No, that was real, dude.

14
00:00:57,269 --> 00:00:58,773
-You saw them?
-I saw 'em, I saw 'em.

15
00:00:58,773 --> 00:01:02,052
-Yeah. Yeah.
-That was the fir-first set
of boobs I ever saw
since my mom's, so...

16
00:01:02,052 --> 00:01:05,940
Do they still have that room
where they paddle you
if you're out of line?

17
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:08,720
-Oh, no, uh, in our day
they called it
the Time-Out Room.

18
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:13,328
And you would just go
and sit there
and fester in your candy-fueled
rage for about 20 minutes.

19
00:01:13,328 --> 00:01:15,609
-Then you learned your lesson,

20
00:01:15,642 --> 00:01:16,132
and they'd send you back out
to unleash it on the kids.

21
00:01:16,132 --> 00:01:18,554
Yeah, listen,
at the end of the day
it's all part of the fun.

22
00:01:18,554 --> 00:01:19,848
I know, but speaking of fun,
let's keep the song...

23
00:01:19,848 --> 00:01:23,192
-Yeah, crank that shit.
-Yeah, yeah, play it again.

24
00:01:24,026 --> 00:01:25,729
-Here comes the...

25
00:01:32,223 --> 00:01:35,034
CENTER

26
00:01:57,519 --> 00:02:00,429
They really spruced
this place up, huh?
Looks good.

27
00:02:00,429 --> 00:02:02,085
But it still sounds
the same, though, right?

28
00:02:02,085 --> 00:02:04,638
But, boy, that noise sure would
send the parents running,
wouldn't it?

29
00:02:04,638 --> 00:02:08,244
Yeah.
Oh, remember when
the moms would go
in the padded bar?

30
00:02:08,244 --> 00:02:10,739
-Oh, yeah, they soundproofed it.
- Yeah, they soundproofed it
so you couldn't hear it.

31
00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:12,620
-Yeah.
-Oh, they would get hammered.

32
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:13,807
What you got there, bozo?

33
00:02:13,807 --> 00:02:17,039
- Just need you to sign
these waivers.
- Eh, no waivers, no.

34
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:19,674
I'm not really supposed to
let you in
unless you sign this.

35
00:02:19,674 --> 00:02:23,097
Oh, yeah, well, listen.
Well, I agree
it's total bullshit
that we would have
to sign a waiver

36
00:02:23,097 --> 00:02:26,487
and also that
we could bum-rush you
and there's nothing
you could do about it.

37
00:02:26,487 --> 00:02:30,009
But you know what?
Listen, today
we're just gonna have fun,
we're not gonna do any of that.

38
00:02:30,009 --> 00:02:32,738
We'll sign your goddamn waivers,
but I want you to know that,
for the record,

39
00:02:32,738 --> 00:02:35,844
- we're doing this under protest.
- Sure, I don't care.

40
00:02:35,844 --> 00:02:38,744
-Okay. Cool, man.
-Hey, here's
a little something for you.

41
00:02:38,744 --> 00:02:40,828
That's not my name.

42
00:02:40,828 --> 00:02:42,701
Yeah, I just went...

43
00:02:43,021 --> 00:02:45,356
There's a bottom section,
too... okay.

44
00:02:45,356 --> 00:02:46,282
-All right, man.

45
00:02:46,282 --> 00:02:48,842
-None of 'em are really...
Okay.

46
00:02:52,287 --> 00:02:53,942
What the hell are you doing?

47
00:02:53,942 --> 00:02:56,554
Drinking water.
What does it look
like I'm do...?

48
00:02:56,554 --> 00:02:58,899
Get the hell out of here!

49
00:02:58,899 --> 00:03:02,642
Frank, what...?
-I guess he's thirsty.
-Yeah.

50
00:03:02,642 --> 00:03:05,285
All right, well, we have a few
hours before the show begins.

51
00:03:05,285 --> 00:03:09,280
I was thinking I would go
redeem my old tickets
and then maybe play
some Skee-Ball.

52
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,838
-Yeah, good call, man.
Nice. Have fun, have fun.
-Get it, go ahead. Yo.

53
00:03:11,838 --> 00:03:17,454
-Hey, uh, Charlie, um,
I can't get past
this whole Justine
the Teen Dream thing.

54
00:03:17,454 --> 00:03:20,940
And this feeling that I just
missed out on my childhood.

55
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:23,851
-And I'm just wondering if
maybe you want to...
-Yes, I do.

56
00:03:23,851 --> 00:03:25,940
-Yeah?
-Yeah, let's go.

57
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:28,847
Well, they're gonna go check out
some animatronic titties, so...

58
00:03:28,847 --> 00:03:30,821
- Hey, you want to do
the joke hunt?
-Yeah!

59
00:03:30,821 --> 00:03:32,558
- Did you have that
when you were a kid?
-Yeah.

60
00:03:32,558 --> 00:03:35,334
Where you search around
for the little pieces of cheese
and they have jokes attached?

61
00:03:35,334 --> 00:03:38,693
Yeah, and if you got 'em all...
...you'd get to meet
Risk E. himself.

62
00:03:38,693 --> 00:03:40,229
And he'd do
his whole routine for you.

63
00:03:40,229 --> 00:03:43,606
Where he would smack
his kids in the head
because they were pieces of shit

64
00:03:43,606 --> 00:03:46,871
and then he would
bust his brother
because he was a lazy drunk.

65
00:03:46,871 --> 00:03:48,756
That was so funny.

66
00:03:48,756 --> 00:03:53,746
-Oh, yeah.
I mean, that, that's funny.
They changed it a bit
by-by the '80s.

67
00:03:53,746 --> 00:03:56,390
-Oh.
-Yeah, I think they...
It was a little bit more
highbrow and, like,

68
00:03:56,390 --> 00:04:00,054
um, uh, topical,
like, like, uh,
like diverse ethnic stuff.

69
00:04:00,054 --> 00:04:02,049
Oh, ethnic, yeah.
Racist.

70
00:04:02,049 --> 00:04:04,740
Mm, no, no.
Not, not racist.
Thinks like, um,

71
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:08,099
you know,
like making fun of people
for not belonging here.

72
00:04:08,099 --> 00:04:11,368
Right? Or like, like it's funny
when people sound funny

73
00:04:11,368 --> 00:04:15,141
because they're, they don't,
they're not from...
they're not from here.

74
00:04:15,141 --> 00:04:16,377
Yeah, because of their race.

75
00:04:16,377 --> 00:04:19,786
Hmm, I don't think that was it
because it was like,
it's like a fish out of water...

76
00:04:19,786 --> 00:04:22,748
-kind of...
Satire? I don't know.

77
00:04:22,748 --> 00:04:25,173
I can't wait to see
who the victims are
these days.

78
00:04:25,173 --> 00:04:26,581
-Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Totally.
-Yeah. Let's go.

79
00:04:26,581 --> 00:04:30,112
-Let's-let's go find
some cheese.
-Let's... okay.
Let's go. Let's go this way.

80
00:04:32,774 --> 00:04:35,618
No more Game Boys,
but they do have a PlayStation.
That's an upgrade.

81
00:04:35,618 --> 00:04:38,175
-Can I help you, sir?
-Ah, yes, you can.

82
00:04:38,175 --> 00:04:41,854
I brought my tickets
and I'd like to make a purchase.
Where are your guns?

83
00:04:41,854 --> 00:04:44,479
- Uh, excuse me?
- Uh, the gun section.

84
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:47,128
I'm very specifically
looking for Risk E.'s rifle.

85
00:04:47,128 --> 00:04:51,618
It had a real heavy feel to it,
it was very realistic,
had a good smoky bang.

86
00:04:51,618 --> 00:04:56,278
I used to put pebbles in there
and I could fire them, like,
right at Charlie's eye.
It was awesome.

87
00:04:56,278 --> 00:05:00,986
Oh, uh, I don't think we have
anything like that.
We have an orange space laser.

88
00:05:00,986 --> 00:05:03,648
What t
he hell am I supposed to
do with an orange space laser?

89
00:05:03,648 --> 00:05:06,836
Have you ever seen anybody use
a space laser in real life?

90
00:05:06,836 --> 00:05:09,491
How do I simulate
real-world violence
with something like that?

91
00:05:09,491 --> 00:05:12,038
Why would you want to simulate
real-world violence?

92
00:05:12,038 --> 00:05:15,363
To get it out of
my system, bozo.
All right, fine.
Forget it.

93
00:05:15,363 --> 00:05:18,467
Just get me one of those, um...
switchblades that are combs.

94
00:05:18,467 --> 00:05:19,972
I don't know what that is.

95
00:05:19,972 --> 00:05:23,169
The switchblades
that become combs
that you can threaten
your friends with,

96
00:05:23,169 --> 00:05:26,147
but then you don't know whether
it's a blade or a comb.
You know what I'm talking about?

97
00:05:26,147 --> 00:05:29,192
Okay, how about
some of that, um...
can you get me some of that gum

98
00:05:29,192 --> 00:05:33,438
that I can put in my mouth
and pretend like I got,
like, a big old fat lip
and spit all over the place?

99
00:05:33,438 --> 00:05:35,451
- You know what I'm talking about?
The...
- I don't think we have those--

100
00:05:35,451 --> 00:05:37,355
What about the candy cigarettes?
Give me candy cigarettes!

101
00:05:37,355 --> 00:05:39,995
Those were discontinued
because cigarettes are illegal.

102
00:05:39,995 --> 00:05:41,842
Okay, for Christ's sakes,
can you get me like...

103
00:05:41,842 --> 00:05:43,958
the extra large
Atomic FireBalls?

104
00:05:43,958 --> 00:05:45,667
I believe they were considered
a choking hazard.

105
00:05:45,667 --> 00:05:49,256
Oh, my God,
a-a box of Nerds, nerd.
Now, Nerds.

106
00:05:49,256 --> 00:05:51,449
Oh, you got those.

107
00:05:51,449 --> 00:05:53,315
What the...?

108
00:05:53,315 --> 00:05:56,162
What is, what is this?
Where's the mouse hall?

109
00:05:56,162 --> 00:05:57,719
Hold on a second.

110
00:05:57,719 --> 00:06:03,549
What, what? So you're telling me
they shut down the-the-the
Ride to Kid City
for a superstore?

111
00:06:03,549 --> 00:06:07,367
I mean, there's clearly
no mouse hall.
There's no way to access
this thing.

112
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:11,413
-Dude, what are they doing, man?
Also, okay, what's up
with the helmet, right?

113
00:06:11,413 --> 00:06:15,096
-Risk E. does not wear
a helmet, remember?
If he would fall and hit
his head, he would say...

114
00:06:15,096 --> 00:06:17,848
- "That's what the bone's for."
- "That's what
the bone was for," right?

115
00:06:17,848 --> 00:06:20,789
- And he'd come up, he'd crack you
on the back of the head.
- He'd smack you in the back of the head.

116
00:06:20,789 --> 00:06:23,037
-"That's what the bone is for!"
-"Bone is for!"

117
00:06:23,037 --> 00:06:25,871
-I mean, that was, like...
-part of the fun of it.
-It's unbelievable, man.

118
00:06:25,871 --> 00:06:28,561
-Things change, I-I get that.
-Okay, fine.
-Things change, right?
-Yeah.

119
00:06:28,561 --> 00:06:32,372
I mean, look,
I don't want to be that old guy
who's, like, complaining about
the way things used to be,

120
00:06:32,372 --> 00:06:34,290
but, you know, I, uh...

121
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:36,315
-Want to see boobs.
-I just do.

122
00:06:36,315 --> 00:06:39,078
You didn't get to see 'em,
and it was a big part of
the experience.

123
00:06:39,078 --> 00:06:41,296
They knew that you needed that.
Risk E. knew that
you needed that.

124
00:06:41,296 --> 00:06:43,696
They knew you were curious.
It wasn't a big deal.

125
00:06:43,696 --> 00:06:47,180
-The boys, they need
something to as... you know.
- Yeah, yeah.
It's great for the boys.

126
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:50,791
- And it's also good for the girls
because then they know
what they're supposed
to look like.
- It's aspirational.

127
00:06:50,791 --> 00:06:53,816
I mean, this,
I don't think this is
the work of Risk E.
You know what I mean? Like...

128
00:06:53,816 --> 00:06:55,752
I feel like Risk E.'s
walled off in there,

129
00:06:55,752 --> 00:07:00,046
and-and I think
Risk E. would want us
to take a risk right now.

130
00:07:00,046 --> 00:07:01,759
He would want us to do it.

131
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:05,700
Do it, whatever we want.
Watch my back.

132
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:07,085
No one looking?

133
00:07:11,355 --> 00:07:14,642
Good, I think you...
made some headway, though.

134
00:07:25,346 --> 00:07:27,579
These balls have
no weight to 'em.

135
00:07:27,579 --> 00:07:31,199
Back in my day, you could crush
a man's skull with one of these.

136
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:33,881
Oh, hey, you're pretty good.

137
00:07:33,881 --> 00:07:36,323
Thanks.
I'm going for 10,000 tickets.

138
00:07:36,323 --> 00:07:38,487
Oh, yeah?
Dude, I got like 7,000.

139
00:07:38,487 --> 00:07:39,778
What? How do you have so many?

140
00:07:39,778 --> 00:07:41,939
I was really good
back in the day.
Better than you.

141
00:07:41,939 --> 00:07:43,924
Oh, well, I only have 1,500.

142
00:07:43,924 --> 00:07:46,731
Oh, you know what we should do?
We should pool our tickets,

143
00:07:46,731 --> 00:07:48,987
and that way we can get, like,
the biggest prize they have.

144
00:07:48,987 --> 00:07:51,417
Uh, I don't think
you're allowed to do that.

145
00:07:51,417 --> 00:07:53,873
Yeah, you can.
This is America.
You can do whatever
the fuck you want.

146
00:07:53,873 --> 00:07:58,830
- You just cursed.
- So what?
We're in an arcade.
And there's no adults around.

147
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:01,450
Hey, do you know how much candy
we can get
with this many tickets?

148
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:04,143
I'm not allowed to eat candy.
I have to ask my parents.

149
00:08:04,143 --> 00:08:07,175
You don't have to ask
your parents anything.
You can eat as much candy
as you want.

150
00:08:07,175 --> 00:08:09,637
You're at Risk E. Rat's.
That's the whole point.
You can do whatever you want.

151
00:08:09,637 --> 00:08:11,640
-I want my mom.
-You're not getting your mom!

152
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,108
Whoa!
Everything okay over here?

153
00:08:13,108 --> 00:08:14,973
Looks like someone might
need to take a breather.

154
00:08:14,973 --> 00:08:17,425
We don't need a breather.
All right? I'm just...

155
00:08:17,425 --> 00:08:19,933
- I'm navigating something
with the kid.
- 'Cause you're a jerk.

156
00:08:19,933 --> 00:08:23,745
You're a jerk,
and now we're in trouble,
and now we have to go
to the Time-Out Room.

157
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:28,735
I tell you what, I don't care
for these new scanners.

158
00:08:28,735 --> 00:08:30,799
You know, it was just so much
cooler when they were like...

159
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,860
-...little plastic pieces
of cheese with the joke on 'em.

160
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:35,378
You'd read the joke
and toss it in the trash.

161
00:08:35,441 --> 00:08:39,836
You know what they,
they used to do?
They used to put 'em
on the waitresses
without them knowing it.

162
00:08:39,836 --> 00:08:43,045
-Really?
-Yeah, that was the fun thing,
because then
you could cop a feel

163
00:08:43,045 --> 00:08:47,018
and they couldn't say anything
because if they did,
they'd lose their jobs.

164
00:08:47,018 --> 00:08:49,938
-That's terrible.
No, it was the '50s.
It was fine.

165
00:08:49,938 --> 00:08:52,813
-Yo, folks.
Got your mozzarella sticks.

166
00:08:52,813 --> 00:08:56,596
- Oh, yeah.
Thank you so much.
- Please be careful, they're hot.

167
00:08:56,596 --> 00:09:00,020
Are they hot, dork?
Are you trying to tell me

168
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:04,021
that these sticks of molten cheese
that just came out of
the deep fryer, they're hot?

169
00:09:04,021 --> 00:09:07,583
- Well, yeah, I don't want you
to get burned.
- Thank you so much
for helping me out.
What'd I've done
if you weren't here?

170
00:09:07,648 --> 00:09:10,019
- Bye. Beat it.
Bye, Jesse.
- Sorry.

171
00:09:10,019 --> 00:09:12,528
-I mean...
- I'm talking about it.

172
00:09:12,528 --> 00:09:16,097
-There's one.
I found it. Look, over there.

173
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:17,317
-Where?
-Right over there.

174
00:09:17,317 --> 00:09:19,996
-Oh, my God. Ooh.
-Un-Un-Under the table.

175
00:09:19,996 --> 00:09:21,822
He wasn't joking.

176
00:09:22,262 --> 00:09:25,106
-[chuckles] Hey, guys.
You having a good time?

177
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:28,248
-Hey there, Dingbat Duck.
Yes, we are.

178
00:09:28,248 --> 00:09:30,776
-Uh, actually,
it's Dapper Duck now.

179
00:09:30,776 --> 00:09:33,536
How do you like
the delectable duds?

180
00:09:33,541 --> 00:09:35,976
It's not Dapper Duck.
You're-you're Dingbat Duck.

181
00:09:35,976 --> 00:09:39,031
Oh, hey, and where's your
stutter? That was your...
-the funny thing you did.
-Yeah, yeah,
where-where's the...?

182
00:09:39,031 --> 00:09:42,277
Oh, I don't stutter.
I have delightful diction.

183
00:09:42,277 --> 00:09:47,235
No, you don't. No, you d...
you d-d-d-d-d-do-do
st-st-st-st-stutter.

184
00:09:47,235 --> 00:09:49,088
And that's the only thing
that's funny about you.

185
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:50,534
-That was good.
-He's laughing.

186
00:09:50,534 --> 00:09:52,986
- Yeah.
- See?
You were, you were the retard.

187
00:09:52,986 --> 00:09:55,821
-What?
-Don't say...
come on, don't say that.

188
00:09:55,821 --> 00:09:58,475
Well, he's a duck.
I wouldn't say that
about a human.

189
00:09:58,475 --> 00:10:01,359
- But you're telling me
I can't say a duck is retarded?
-Yes.

190
00:10:01,359 --> 00:10:04,072
-No? What do you mean?
Suppose he walked up here,

191
00:10:04,072 --> 00:10:07,742
and his feet were on backwards
and his beak was on
the inside of his head,

192
00:10:07,742 --> 00:10:09,474
what, then I could
call him retarded?

193
00:10:09,474 --> 00:10:12,247
Well, no.
Then you're dealing with
a mutant duck,
and that's not funny.

194
00:10:12,247 --> 00:10:17,060
But his whole shtick was that
he would drool and slobber
and-and, you know,
he was like...

195
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:20,940
He could b-b-b-b-b-b-barely get
the w-w-w-w-w-w-w-w-words out.

196
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:25,605
-His mouth was retarded.
-Stop saying "retarded."

197
00:10:25,775 --> 00:10:27,628
'Cause I didn't see anything
backstage and...

198
00:10:27,628 --> 00:10:30,943
Oh, shit. Okay. Look, look,
look at, look at this.

199
00:10:30,943 --> 00:10:32,955
Oh, man, this is, this is sad.

200
00:10:32,955 --> 00:10:36,404
And they stuck 'em
all in storage, dude.
The whole band is here, dude.

201
00:10:36,404 --> 00:10:40,050
You got Spaz the drummer,
Chef Greaseball Linguini.

202
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:43,363
-Dr. Slice
the Funky Funkosapien
or whatever he was.

203
00:10:43,363 --> 00:10:46,926
Was he supposed to be Black?
-Yeah. I, yeah, I-I think so.

204
00:10:46,926 --> 00:10:49,266
And you know what?
Now that I think of it,
it's good that
they're updating that.

205
00:10:49,371 --> 00:10:53,098
I mean, you can't have
a purple character
-that does a Black voice.

206
00:10:53,098 --> 00:10:55,016
-Why not?
- Well, because...

207
00:10:55,421 --> 00:10:58,948
If you're gonna put
a Black person in the band,
it's got to be
representative of...

208
00:10:58,948 --> 00:11:01,535
It was a white guy
doing the voice.
-That was the problem.

209
00:11:01,535 --> 00:11:03,278
-Yeah, yeah.
-It was a white guy doing
a Black voice...

210
00:11:03,278 --> 00:11:04,537
-No, no, no, that's--
-...in a purple costume.

211
00:11:04,537 --> 00:11:07,718
- That's not a good look,
you know what I mean?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
No. For sure, for sure.

212
00:11:07,718 --> 00:11:09,338
But they are purple.

213
00:11:09,338 --> 00:11:11,788
- Who? What?
- Monsters.
You know, like...

214
00:11:11,788 --> 00:11:15,412
-Monsters are purple?
-Yeah. Blue, green, purple, orange,

215
00:11:15,412 --> 00:11:19,292
and we can't just, like,
not have purple monsters
in bands anymore.

216
00:11:19,292 --> 00:11:20,356
-All right, you know what? I...

217
00:11:20,356 --> 00:11:23,979
-Oh, but they should have
white voices.
-Well, they should have
monster voices.

218
00:11:23,979 --> 00:11:27,009
They should have monster voices
because we need monster
representation.

219
00:11:27,009 --> 00:11:29,312
So we can't just
put them in boxes.

220
00:11:29,409 --> 00:11:32,812
- This is all very
complicated stuff, man.
It's tough to navigate it, man.
-It is complicated, man.

221
00:11:32,812 --> 00:11:35,216
I don't know what the answer is,
so I'm gonna move past it.

222
00:11:35,313 --> 00:11:37,693
-All right, as long
as they can still have
-groovy monsters, you know?
-Yeah.

223
00:11:37,693 --> 00:11:40,000
Look at all this stuff.
Eh, tell you what,

224
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:42,340
some of this stuff brings back
a lot of memories.

225
00:11:43,304 --> 00:11:45,756
Oh, no.

226
00:11:45,991 --> 00:11:50,102
-Sweet Justine.
What have they done to you?

227
00:11:50,102 --> 00:11:51,677
Oh, man.

228
00:11:51,677 --> 00:11:53,715
Bam! Look at those.

229
00:11:53,715 --> 00:11:56,825
-Hey, you found her torso.
- Yeah.

230
00:11:58,374 --> 00:11:59,438
- Hey-hey.
-That looks crazy, man.

231
00:11:59,438 --> 00:12:01,579
- That is something else,
isn't it? Mmm.
- Yeah, yeah.

232
00:12:01,579 --> 00:12:04,483
Now, are you telling me that
there is a lifelike set 

233
00:12:04,483 --> 00:12:07,680
of
animatronic breasts under there?
-I am, sir.

234
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,721
-Really?
-Yeah. Very accurate design.

235
00:12:10,721 --> 00:12:13,433
-Uh, nipples.
-Interesting.

236
00:12:13,467 --> 00:12:15,035
-All the curves.
-Fascinating.

237
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:16,336
-Yeah, wow, good.
-Yeah.

238
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:19,072
Yeah, okay.
So I will take, uh...

239
00:12:19,106 --> 00:12:20,641
-Yeah.
-...the shirt off.

240
00:12:20,674 --> 00:12:23,410
-Let's, uh, let's pop it off.
-And, uh, I... hmm...

241
00:12:23,443 --> 00:12:25,512
Hmm, I'm sorry,
is it wrong to do this?

242
00:12:25,546 --> 00:12:27,714
If I'm being honest,
it feels wrong to me as well.

243
00:12:27,748 --> 00:12:30,284
- Right, but why?
Why would--?
-I don't know.

244
00:12:30,317 --> 00:12:31,785
-Is it 'cause she's underage?
-No.

245
00:12:31,818 --> 00:12:33,754
I mean, she's a robot,
man, like...

246
00:12:33,787 --> 00:12:35,455
-Right. Robot.
-They're ageless.

247
00:12:35,489 --> 00:12:37,424
Now, wait a second.

248
00:12:37,457 --> 00:12:40,394
We could just be two mature men
with an interest in robotics.

249
00:12:40,427 --> 00:12:42,296
This could be science
is what you're saying.

250
00:12:42,329 --> 00:12:44,631
I think this is
a scientific experiment,

251
00:12:44,665 --> 00:12:46,333
and that's one way
to look at it, and--

252
00:12:46,366 --> 00:12:49,303
This is for the good of...
future robots, right?

253
00:12:49,336 --> 00:12:50,504
So, for the good of...
science...

254
00:12:50,537 --> 00:12:52,172
-Yeah.
-...I'm just gonna

255
00:12:52,206 --> 00:12:53,473
-go ahead and...
-Yeah.

256
00:12:53,507 --> 00:12:55,309
I'm gonna slide this down here.

257
00:12:55,342 --> 00:12:56,210
Just for scientific purposes
we can... aah!

258
00:12:56,243 --> 00:12:58,011
Oh, God!

259
00:12:58,045 --> 00:12:59,613
-That is...

260
00:13:00,681 --> 00:13:02,416
-What?!
-How did they...?

261
00:13:02,449 --> 00:13:04,618
These are not the boobs I saw,
dude, these are not them.

262
00:13:04,651 --> 00:13:06,486
This is so disturbing.

263
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:09,156
They-they took her tits off.
They literally sanded 'em off!

264
00:13:09,189 --> 00:13:12,125
-They mutilated this poor woman.
-That is disgusting.

265
00:13:12,159 --> 00:13:13,260
Goddamn libs.

266
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:15,028
-Unbelievable.
-Oh, my God.

267
00:13:15,062 --> 00:13:16,763
And this could be the
religious conservatives, too.

268
00:13:16,797 --> 00:13:18,532
You know, y-you don't know.

269
00:13:18,565 --> 00:13:20,400
-That's true.
-Which kind of--

270
00:13:20,434 --> 00:13:22,369
Lopping tits off feels like a,
feels like a religious move.

271
00:13:22,402 --> 00:13:23,737
-Yeah, that's
some kind of like--
-I don't know anymore.

272
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:25,405
-Everybody's crazy these days.

273
00:13:25,439 --> 00:13:27,040
This is nuts, man.
I'll tell you what, though.

274
00:13:27,074 --> 00:13:29,109
This is a sad day
for women's rights.

275
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:37,584
Now, Mac, tell us
how you're feeling right now.

276
00:13:37,618 --> 00:13:40,354
Well, I... feel angry.

277
00:13:40,387 --> 00:13:41,622
Is there anything else?

278
00:13:41,655 --> 00:13:46,226
Yeah, I feel...
misunderstood.

279
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:47,528
Unheard.

280
00:13:47,561 --> 00:13:49,730
Thank you.

281
00:13:49,763 --> 00:13:51,565
Sam, how are you feeling?

282
00:13:51,598 --> 00:13:53,467
I feel stupid.

283
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,035
You are stupid.
It's 'cause you're stupid.

284
00:13:55,068 --> 00:13:56,170
-Shut up.
-Now, Mac...
-You shut up.

285
00:13:56,203 --> 00:13:57,638
-Mac.
-He's getting sassy.

286
00:13:57,671 --> 00:13:59,339
-I was not being sassy.
-You were being sassy.

287
00:13:59,373 --> 00:14:01,008
You... Okay, hey, guys.

288
00:14:01,041 --> 00:14:02,743
Honestly, you were both being
a little sassy.

289
00:14:02,776 --> 00:14:07,214
But right now I just want to
hear about Sam's emotions, okay?

290
00:14:08,382 --> 00:14:09,516
Fine.

291
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:11,051
Thank you.

292
00:14:11,084 --> 00:14:12,586
There's that sass
that I was talking about.

293
00:14:12,619 --> 00:14:14,621
I feel like we're getting stuck
on the sass of it.

294
00:14:14,655 --> 00:14:16,156
It's hard not to get
stuck in the sass.

295
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:17,157
-I understand.
-I'm mired in the sass

296
00:14:17,191 --> 00:14:18,525
because the kid is so sassy.

297
00:14:18,559 --> 00:14:19,660
Let's just let him talk,
and I feel

298
00:14:19,693 --> 00:14:21,728
like it'll all sort itself out.

299
00:14:21,762 --> 00:14:23,630
Fine.

300
00:14:23,664 --> 00:14:28,502
As I was saying, I feel stupid
talking about my feelings.

301
00:14:28,535 --> 00:14:30,504
Like, I don't want to be
in the Feelings Center.

302
00:14:30,537 --> 00:14:32,406
That's not the point
of Risk E. Rat's.

303
00:14:32,439 --> 00:14:34,341
-We are on the same page there

304
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:36,276
'cause, like,
this isn't the point.

305
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:37,778
I don't want to be in
the Feelings Center either,

306
00:14:37,811 --> 00:14:40,147
and, like, he's dead right
about Risk E. Rat's.

307
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:41,248
That's the whole point of it.

308
00:14:41,281 --> 00:14:42,683
And...

309
00:14:42,716 --> 00:14:45,452
I feel I just want to go
out there and have fun.

310
00:14:45,485 --> 00:14:47,020
That's what I want to do, too.

311
00:14:47,054 --> 00:14:48,055
I just want to play
and have fun, and--

312
00:14:48,088 --> 00:14:50,057
-See?
-Good, good.

313
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:52,593
Hey, here's the question
about that, you guys.

314
00:14:52,626 --> 00:14:55,629
Do we feel like
we've earned that?

315
00:14:55,662 --> 00:14:56,630
Yes.

316
00:14:56,663 --> 00:14:59,132
Okay, well, so do I.

317
00:14:59,166 --> 00:15:02,102
-Let's get out there
and have some fun, shall we?
-Wait, wait, wait, wait.

318
00:15:02,135 --> 00:15:03,470
We've only been here
for like five minutes.

319
00:15:03,504 --> 00:15:05,706
That's not a punishment.
I-I don't feel punished.

320
00:15:05,739 --> 00:15:07,508
Where-Where's the shame
I'm supposed to be feeling?

321
00:15:07,541 --> 00:15:09,443
There's no shame in
making a mistake, Mac.

322
00:15:09,476 --> 00:15:11,078
Yes, there is.

323
00:15:11,111 --> 00:15:12,546
How else would I know
not to do it anymore?

324
00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:14,248
Hey, listen, man.
I'm a licensed psychotherapist.

325
00:15:14,281 --> 00:15:16,617
You're a talking dog.
I'm out of here.

326
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:18,452
- Great.
-I'm scared.
-I'm sure you are, Sam.

327
00:15:18,485 --> 00:15:20,153
I'm sure you are.

328
00:15:20,187 --> 00:15:21,355
'Cause you're a pussy.

329
00:15:22,322 --> 00:15:23,724
Now, look, look, man, that's...

330
00:15:23,757 --> 00:15:25,325
-that's not your fault.
-Jesus Christ, man.

331
00:15:25,359 --> 00:15:27,194
It's not your fault.
This dog, your parents,

332
00:15:27,227 --> 00:15:30,197
the whole, the whole culture
is grooming you to be a pussy.

333
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:31,365
You got no freedom,

334
00:15:31,398 --> 00:15:33,367
which means you got no balls.

335
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:36,403
And then, even when
you actually do get caught

336
00:15:36,436 --> 00:15:39,239
doing something bad,
you're not held accountable.

337
00:15:39,273 --> 00:15:41,208
And if you're not held
accountable, you feel no guilt.

338
00:15:41,241 --> 00:15:43,010
If you feel no guilt,
you feel no shame.

339
00:15:43,043 --> 00:15:45,479
If you got no shame...

340
00:15:45,512 --> 00:15:47,414
you're never gonna hate
yourself enough

341
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:51,218
to stop being bad
and grow some balls.

342
00:15:52,786 --> 00:15:54,655
You diddle this kid,
you're definitely on camera.

343
00:15:54,688 --> 00:15:56,123
I don't know if you want
to be alone with him.

344
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:00,160
All right,
this is the last piece.

345
00:16:00,194 --> 00:16:01,361
-All right, what's it say?

346
00:16:01,395 --> 00:16:03,363
"What does a nosy pepper do?"

347
00:16:03,397 --> 00:16:05,999
-What?
-"It gets jalapeño business."

348
00:16:06,033 --> 00:16:08,402
That's stupid.
Let me see it.

349
00:16:08,435 --> 00:16:10,437
Oh, I get it!
You know what it is?

350
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:12,306
You got to do it with an accent.

351
00:16:12,339 --> 00:16:14,708
Uh, it gets
"all-up-in-yo" business.

352
00:16:14,741 --> 00:16:16,143
-Get it?
-Yeah, well, that's funny.

353
00:16:16,176 --> 00:16:17,444
-Yeah.
-'Cause that's Black.

354
00:16:17,477 --> 00:16:19,580
-That's Black.
-Well, n-not necessarily,

355
00:16:19,613 --> 00:16:21,148
but it is sassy.

356
00:16:21,181 --> 00:16:23,083
You just got to put
some sass on there.

357
00:16:23,116 --> 00:16:24,518
It also could be
Mexican, I guess,

358
00:16:24,551 --> 00:16:26,687
'cause of the jalapeño,
that's a Mexican pepper.

359
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,623
-Um, gets "hall-up-in-your"
business, see?
-Oh, yeah, that...

360
00:16:29,656 --> 00:16:31,658
I get it, but I got to know
who it's about.

361
00:16:31,692 --> 00:16:33,227
I-I don't think
it's about anybody.

362
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:34,661
I think it's just
a-a play on words.

363
00:16:34,695 --> 00:16:36,663
But I got to know
who the victim is

364
00:16:36,697 --> 00:16:38,398
in order for me
to laugh at them.

365
00:16:38,432 --> 00:16:40,367
Yeah, I'll tell you what,
in this scenario it's whites

366
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,002
because white people
are the only people

367
00:16:42,035 --> 00:16:43,537
who don't have the accent
to pull off the joke.

368
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:45,339
-Well, that's racist.
-That is racist,

369
00:16:45,372 --> 00:16:46,607
-and I don't appreciate it.
-That's very racist.

370
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:48,175
I'll tell you that much
right now.

371
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:49,443
Is this the satire
you're talking about?

372
00:16:49,476 --> 00:16:51,445
I don't know.
If I'm being honest,

373
00:16:51,478 --> 00:16:53,747
I don't 100% understand
what satire means.

374
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:55,315
-Let's go through
the jokes again.

375
00:17:03,056 --> 00:17:05,159
-Yeah, it's not good now,
man, you know?
-Yeah, it's the pits.

376
00:17:05,192 --> 00:17:06,527
Really creepy, too.

377
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:08,061
Like, who are the weirdos
with the kids?

378
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:10,130
I think it's their parents.

379
00:17:10,164 --> 00:17:12,399
-The parents should be
in the bar.
-Charlie, there is no bar.

380
00:17:12,432 --> 00:17:14,301
-What? Are you serious?
They got rid of the bar?
-There's no bar?

381
00:17:14,334 --> 00:17:16,036
Oh, that's crazy.

382
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:17,538
This was, like, one of
the best bars in town, man.

383
00:17:17,571 --> 00:17:18,572
All right, all right,
you know what? Every...

384
00:17:18,605 --> 00:17:20,407
Let's just, everybody calm down.

385
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:22,676
Okay? We're here, you know?
Let's give it another shot.

386
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:24,178
Right? The show's
about to begin.

387
00:17:24,211 --> 00:17:25,445
That was always
one of the best parts

388
00:17:25,479 --> 00:17:27,047
of this place anyway, right?
The show.

389
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:28,582
-Okay. Okay.
-Let's see if the show's good.

390
00:17:28,615 --> 00:17:29,750
-One, one last shot.
-Hard to screw the show up.

391
00:17:29,783 --> 00:17:31,351
They could redeem
themselves here.

392
00:17:31,385 --> 00:17:33,554
Everybody clap your hands

393
00:17:33,587 --> 00:17:35,756
'cause it's time to party.

394
00:17:35,789 --> 00:17:38,058
-Here it comes.

395
00:17:38,091 --> 00:17:39,560
-Okay. Okay.
-Party time, baby.

396
00:17:39,593 --> 00:17:41,195
It's party time.

397
00:17:41,228 --> 00:17:42,663
What are these?

398
00:17:42,696 --> 00:17:44,131
-What's this?
-Earplugs?
-Earphones?

399
00:17:44,164 --> 00:17:45,399
-Are you serious?
-No, no, no, no, no.

400
00:17:45,432 --> 00:17:46,567
-No, no, no, no. No.
-Get out of here.

401
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,168
I want to be able
to hear the show.

402
00:17:48,202 --> 00:17:49,069
-Risk E., Risk E....
-This is a jam, right?

403
00:17:49,102 --> 00:17:50,337
Has a good beat going.

404
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:51,705
Yeah, I like that beat.
That's it.

405
00:17:51,738 --> 00:17:54,575
♪ It's time for magic and fun ♪

406
00:17:54,608 --> 00:17:58,212
♪ Rocking out at
Robbie-pizza.com ♪

407
00:17:58,245 --> 00:17:59,479
What the...?

408
00:17:59,513 --> 00:18:01,582
Did he just say
Robbie-pizza.com?

409
00:18:01,615 --> 00:18:03,150
-Did they change the name?
-They can't...

410
00:18:03,183 --> 00:18:04,685
You cannot call a place
a website.

411
00:18:04,718 --> 00:18:05,719
That's crazy.

412
00:18:05,752 --> 00:18:07,187
He's not Risk E. anymore?

413
00:18:07,221 --> 00:18:08,689
-He's Robbie now?

414
00:18:08,722 --> 00:18:11,658
This is so depressing,
but, g-guys, we c...

415
00:18:11,692 --> 00:18:13,193
we can't wallow.

416
00:18:13,227 --> 00:18:14,728
We got to do something
about this.

417
00:18:14,761 --> 00:18:16,430
For the sake of the kids!

418
00:18:16,463 --> 00:18:19,433
Okay.
So here's what we do.

419
00:18:19,466 --> 00:18:23,036
We recreate the old Risk E.'s
so that these kids can have

420
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:25,572
the same experience that we had
when we were younger

421
00:18:25,606 --> 00:18:28,075
and they can perhaps
tell the tale.

422
00:18:28,108 --> 00:18:30,544
That's exactly
what I was thinking.

423
00:18:30,577 --> 00:18:33,180
Guys, let's get risky.

424
00:19:15,589 --> 00:19:19,293
Wow.
Those kids are jazzed.

425
00:19:19,326 --> 00:19:21,461
-Wow!
-Yeah, man, we're all set here.

426
00:19:23,063 --> 00:19:24,598
Guys, I got to say,
I think we've...

427
00:19:24,631 --> 00:19:25,732
I think we've done something
pretty magical here today.

428
00:19:25,766 --> 00:19:27,134
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.
-Yeah!

429
00:19:27,167 --> 00:19:29,169
Okay.
On the count of three,

430
00:19:29,203 --> 00:19:31,271
you open the doors
and let 'em in...

431
00:19:31,305 --> 00:19:34,174
- Yeah.
-...and I will throw this switch

432
00:19:34,208 --> 00:19:35,742
and let the real fun begin.

433
00:19:35,776 --> 00:19:37,477
- Yeah, baby.
-Ready?

434
00:19:37,511 --> 00:19:39,580
-That's the attitude, Frank.

435
00:19:39,613 --> 00:19:41,582
- Let's do it,
let's do it.
- Yeah, all right.

436
00:19:41,615 --> 00:19:45,185
Three, two, one...

437
00:19:45,219 --> 00:19:46,453
Fun!

438
00:19:48,522 --> 00:19:51,658
Where's my son?!
Where's my son?!

439
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:55,696
They're standing
right over there. Go get them.

440
00:20:03,203 --> 00:20:06,139
-Well, that got out of hand.
-Yeah.

441
00:20:06,173 --> 00:20:07,574
Yeah, these kids, they just,

442
00:20:07,608 --> 00:20:08,542
th-they weren't prepared
for that amount of fun.

443
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:10,077
You know what it is?

444
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:12,045
That's because they were
sheltered too much.

445
00:20:12,079 --> 00:20:13,447
-Right.
-I'm glad that they signed
the waiver, though.

446
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:15,082
Oh, right.
No lawsuits for them.

447
00:20:15,115 --> 00:20:17,050
-They can't do shit.

448
00:20:17,084 --> 00:20:19,453
-Nobody can sue.
-Although you didn't,
you didn't sign anything.

449
00:20:19,486 --> 00:20:21,421
Ah, they won't find me.

450
00:20:21,455 --> 00:20:23,323
-Hey, should we get out of here?
-Yes.
-Probably, yes.

451
00:20:23,357 --> 00:20:25,292
-Let's go, let's go.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Let's slip out.
