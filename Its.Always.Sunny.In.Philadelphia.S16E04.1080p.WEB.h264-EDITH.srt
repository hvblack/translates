1
00:00:07,458 --> 00:00:09,278
Frank!
Frank, come on, man!

2
00:00:09,278 --> 00:00:11,064
We got to go!
We got to go!

3
00:00:11,064 --> 00:00:13,326
-Oh, what?
- Come on, man,
we're gonna miss it.

4
00:00:13,326 --> 00:00:16,322
-Wake up, wake up. Come on.
-Wh-What?
-Right away!
-Okay.

5
00:00:16,322 --> 00:00:18,511
Guys, make way.
Make way, please.

6
00:00:18,511 --> 00:00:21,104
-Hey, wait, no, no, please.
-Cutting it
pretty close there, pal.

7
00:00:21,104 --> 00:00:23,936
Ah, I feel like
I got to take a shit.
- No, no, no, no, no.
There's no time for that.

8
00:00:23,936 --> 00:00:25,686
-Oh, God, excuse me. Come on.
- No, no, no, no,
no autographs.

9
00:00:25,686 --> 00:00:26,870
-I'm not ready for this.

10
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:28,607
-Listen, listen.
-You got it, you got it,
you got it.

11
00:00:28,607 --> 00:00:30,597
-Frank, you are ready.

12
00:00:30,597 --> 00:00:34,350
Everything you need
is already inside you.

13
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:37,063
Move. No, out of the way.

14
00:00:47,046 --> 00:00:49,928
VS

15
00:01:09,616 --> 00:01:11,441
-Dennis, please. Just...
-God, no.

16
00:01:11,441 --> 00:01:13,110
Please, please.
Pretty please, just help me.

17
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:16,244
No! No, Mac.
I'm not helping you, okay?

18
00:01:16,244 --> 00:01:17,819
Stop talking to me about Johnny.

19
00:01:17,819 --> 00:01:21,352
Well, hey, I could help you
with your guy troubles.

20
00:01:21,352 --> 00:01:23,466
No, thanks, Dee.
You suck with men.

21
00:01:23,466 --> 00:01:25,813
Tell that to the guy leaving
my apartment this morning.

22
00:01:25,813 --> 00:01:29,431
That's right. Your girl
got her guts pumped last night.

23
00:01:29,431 --> 00:01:32,320
Oh, my God, that is disgusting.
-Your guts pumped?

24
00:01:32,386 --> 00:01:34,727
-Aren't you, like, 60?
You're not a girl.

25
00:01:34,793 --> 00:01:37,221
-Yeah, come on, Dee.
This is insane.
-I mean... really.
-Who talks like that?

26
00:01:37,221 --> 00:01:40,115
And, by the way, anybody can
get a guy to bang them once.

27
00:01:40,115 --> 00:01:43,846
Okay, well, I guarantee you
he'll be coming back
for seconds.

28
00:01:43,846 --> 00:01:46,748
In fact, he pulled
an old move of mine.

29
00:01:46,748 --> 00:01:49,328
He took my phone "by mistake"

30
00:01:49,362 --> 00:01:50,551
so that he could see me again.

31
00:01:50,551 --> 00:01:54,737
Oh, okay. Yeah.
How's he gonna call you?

32
00:01:57,554 --> 00:01:59,166
-Dennis, can you
help me get my phone--
-No.

33
00:01:59,166 --> 00:02:01,554
-Dennis, Dennis, I need
your help really quick, man.
-No!

34
00:02:01,554 --> 00:02:03,551
Do you remember when we stole a
restaurant buzzer the other day?

35
00:02:03,551 --> 00:02:06,279
I can't find it anywhere.
It's a matter of
national security here, man.

36
00:02:06,279 --> 00:02:07,674
Oh, yes, no, no, I'm sure, yeah.

37
00:02:07,674 --> 00:02:10,686
You know what? Maybe it's in
the back office. Let me check
the back office. Frank,
let me check the back office.

38
00:02:10,686 --> 00:02:12,818
Hey, uh, Frank, could you
help me with something?
-Yeah.

39
00:02:12,818 --> 00:02:17,270
-Are you kidding?
You want Frank's help
with your guy troubles?
He's insanely homophobic.

40
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:21,376
Huh? Not anymore.
No, once Mac did the dance,

41
00:02:21,376 --> 00:02:24,217
- then I get it. I get the gay thing.
- He gets it. He's an ally now.

42
00:02:24,217 --> 00:02:26,455
Okay, so, Frank, I need
some relationship advice.

43
00:02:26,455 --> 00:02:28,872
-I'm having some issues
with this guy that I'm dating.

44
00:02:28,872 --> 00:02:32,713
-I want to take it
to the next level, you know,
by actually meeting this guy.

45
00:02:32,713 --> 00:02:36,625
- What, you've never met the guy?
- No, never met him,
never spoken with him,
never seen him,

46
00:02:36,625 --> 00:02:40,797
but it's not weird
because we're in
constant communication
through the beads.

47
00:02:41,214 --> 00:02:45,834
- The beads?
- Oh, yes.
The extra-large anal beads
that I shoved up my butt,

48
00:02:45,834 --> 00:02:49,843
and Johnny can control them
via an app on his phone.

49
00:02:49,843 --> 00:02:53,448
And when I feel the buzz,
I know it's time
to go to the motel
and wait.

50
00:02:53,448 --> 00:02:54,855
It's very romantic.

51
00:02:54,855 --> 00:02:58,058
Uh, yes, he's never
actually showed up before,

52
00:02:58,058 --> 00:03:01,567
but one day he will,
and it's going to be hot.

53
00:03:01,567 --> 00:03:04,054
That's it.
I'm out.

54
00:03:04,054 --> 00:03:07,711
I'm out. That's it. I don't
get it. I am never gonna get it.

55
00:03:07,711 --> 00:03:10,151
-Beads? You never said
anything about beads.
-Let me-let me explain it again.

56
00:03:10,151 --> 00:03:11,824
It's beads that go into my ass.

57
00:03:11,824 --> 00:03:14,240
The dance never said anything
about no beads.

58
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:17,730
- Frank, I found it. I found it.
I found it.
- Let's get the hell out of here.

59
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:18,902
We got it, guys, we're good.

60
00:03:18,902 --> 00:03:20,150
Anal beads up his ass.

61
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:22,527
Dennis, can you please help me
get my phone back?
'Cause I need my phone.

62
00:03:22,527 --> 00:03:23,903
No, Dennis, help
me, though. Help me because
-I need help--

63
00:03:23,903 --> 00:03:27,107
-No, you are beyond help, okay?
You let a stranger
hack your butthole. Dennis--

64
00:03:27,107 --> 00:03:28,919
Enough! Enough.

65
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:32,162
It is clear that I'm not going
to get a moment's peace

66
00:03:32,162 --> 00:03:35,695
until I foist you two
off on someone else,
so, fine, I will help you.

67
00:03:35,695 --> 00:03:38,353
-Okay. Okay.
-Oh, yeah! All right, all right,
let's go.

68
00:03:39,972 --> 00:03:43,919
- This is all I could find.
- Yeah, no, this is good. Um...

69
00:03:43,974 --> 00:03:47,822
Okay, are there, like, a pair
of, like, weird spy glasses
in here or anything?

70
00:03:47,822 --> 00:03:50,587
-Aw, shit.
-They dropped all those charges
weeks ago. Wh--

71
00:03:50,587 --> 00:03:52,197
Call you back.

72
00:03:52,197 --> 00:03:55,109
Hey, what are you guys doing
with all my research equipment?

73
00:03:55,109 --> 00:03:57,034
Charlie and Frank
are gonna play spies.

74
00:03:57,034 --> 00:03:59,157
Yeah, well, we're not
playing spies,
we're playing chess, okay?

75
00:03:59,157 --> 00:04:02,308
There's a Russian grandmaster
coming to town.
I'm entering Frank
in the tournament,

76
00:04:02,308 --> 00:04:06,351
and then he's gonna
rise through the ranks,
and he's gonna beat
this guy's ass, USA style.

77
00:04:06,418 --> 00:04:09,682
So, I need the glasses,
Uncle Jack,
because Frank's got to be able
to transmit me the board

78
00:04:09,682 --> 00:04:13,066
while I play along
on a computer
and I signal him the moves
with the restaurant buzzer.

79
00:04:13,066 --> 00:04:17,270
No, stop, stop, stop.
Uh, you're gonna break it.
This is, uh,
very sensitive equipment.

80
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:20,571
Right, yeah, okay.
Look, do you have
the spy glasses or not, dude?

81
00:04:20,571 --> 00:04:24,410
Fine. I'll let you borrow them,
but I'm coming with.
Okay? I don't want you
breaking any of this.

82
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:25,830
-A play date.

83
00:04:25,924 --> 00:04:28,004
-Goddamn it.
-Oh, yeah. Like we used to.

84
00:04:28,004 --> 00:04:29,074
-We never did.

85
00:04:29,074 --> 00:04:32,310
-Man, we never did.
- You don't remember.

86
00:04:33,513 --> 00:04:37,858
I mean, what is taking
Uncle Jack so long?
-Well, why don't we just go in?

87
00:04:37,858 --> 00:04:39,741
Hang on.

88
00:04:43,414 --> 00:04:45,229
-What the...
-Is that-is that him?

89
00:04:45,229 --> 00:04:47,358
Holy shit.

90
00:04:47,428 --> 00:04:50,244
Uh, Uncle Jack,
what-what is this?

91
00:04:50,244 --> 00:04:51,656
-My ice cream truck.

92
00:04:51,656 --> 00:04:54,728
You know, I-I have, like,
a side business.

93
00:04:54,728 --> 00:04:57,645
Ugh. All right, fine. You know
what? Actually, this could work.

94
00:04:57,645 --> 00:04:59,692
-You got the spy glasses?
-Yeah. Here they are.
-Glasses.

95
00:04:59,692 --> 00:05:01,965
-Here's how this goes.
Frank, you got the buzzer?
-Yeah, I got the buzzer.

96
00:05:01,965 --> 00:05:04,005
-All right, so Frank's got
a buzzer in his pocket, okay?
-I'm gonna put it in my pocket.

97
00:05:04,005 --> 00:05:07,997
So, he'll hover his hand
over the piece, you know,
one buzz for yes,
two buzzes for no,

98
00:05:07,997 --> 00:05:09,913
three if you need him to switch
to a different piece, okay?

99
00:05:09,913 --> 00:05:11,824
Same goes for where
to put it down. Got it?
-Okay.

100
00:05:11,824 --> 00:05:12,619
-You clear?
- Yup.

101
00:05:12,619 --> 00:05:14,533
-Give me a Push Pop, will you?
-And get him a Push Pop.

102
00:05:14,533 --> 00:05:17,369
What? Oh, no, I-I don't have
any ice cream.

103
00:05:17,369 --> 00:05:20,601
-Oh, my God. All right, fine.
Just... just...

104
00:05:20,601 --> 00:05:22,794
-get to your spot
and play the-- Ugh.
- Okay.

105
00:05:22,794 --> 00:05:25,179
Hey, I'll be watching you.

106
00:05:29,059 --> 00:05:31,834
Should I go here?

107
00:05:31,834 --> 00:05:36,024
-Mm. Or should I go...
here?

108
00:05:36,024 --> 00:05:38,478
Charlie, don't look at the kid,
look at the board.

109
00:05:38,478 --> 00:05:41,617
Actually,
one quick look at the kid again,
so I can get a screen grab.

110
00:05:41,617 --> 00:05:42,942
-Gross, no, man, no.

111
00:05:42,942 --> 00:05:45,103
-No? No?
- I-- No, not you. Sorry.

112
00:05:45,103 --> 00:05:46,853
Talking to the voices
in my head, so...

113
00:05:46,853 --> 00:05:48,916
-Stay on the board.
-Yup. Yes.

114
00:05:48,916 --> 00:05:51,893
- Don't mind my friend.
He's schizophrenic.
-I am, yeah.

115
00:05:51,893 --> 00:05:53,646
- Got it.

116
00:05:56,563 --> 00:05:59,911
Boom.
I took your little
castle-y thing.

117
00:05:59,911 --> 00:06:02,202
Suck on that,
boy!

118
00:06:02,202 --> 00:06:05,034
If he does, let me get
another screen grab.

119
00:06:05,034 --> 00:06:07,572
Shut up, dude.
That's gross, man.

120
00:06:07,572 --> 00:06:10,777
-Sir?
Uh, sir, may I have
a word with you?

121
00:06:10,777 --> 00:06:13,650
Um, absolutely not because
I'm in the middle of watching
a game of chess.

122
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:16,606
Uh, there is no alcohol allowed
on the premises.

123
00:06:16,606 --> 00:06:20,169
What? Wh-What do you mean?
Like, I got to drink wine
or something?

124
00:06:20,169 --> 00:06:23,094
No alcohol at all.
At a sporting event?

125
00:06:23,094 --> 00:06:25,987
That's crazy.
Fine, dude. Here you go.

126
00:06:25,987 --> 00:06:28,844
Frank, I'm gonna have to find
some way to sneak beer in here.

127
00:06:28,844 --> 00:06:32,348
- Excuse me?
- Dude, are you still here?
Go away.

128
00:06:32,348 --> 00:06:35,321
I gave you the beer, man.

129
00:06:38,474 --> 00:06:42,546
Now, as you're both aware,
I have a foolproof system
for attracting a woman.

130
00:06:42,546 --> 00:06:47,549
But I also have
a foolproof system
for attracting a man.

131
00:06:47,549 --> 00:06:50,268
-Aw, awesome.
-No way.

132
00:06:50,334 --> 00:06:52,668
-Why?
-How come?
-Shh, shh.

133
00:06:54,674 --> 00:06:58,108
Okay.
Now, it begins
with me setting you both up

134
00:06:58,108 --> 00:07:00,930
with nice, normal dates.

135
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:04,495
You will begin by greeting them
with the traditional
pleasantries.

136
00:07:04,495 --> 00:07:05,663
Very nice to meet you, Patrick.

137
00:07:05,663 --> 00:07:08,791
- Kyle, it's a pleasure.
- Pleasure's all mine.

138
00:07:08,791 --> 00:07:12,544
I'll be nearby, of course,
to make sure nothing goes awry.

139
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:15,892
Step one.

140
00:07:15,892 --> 00:07:18,912
S-- suppress your instincts.

141
00:07:18,912 --> 00:07:23,189
See, your first instinct
is going to be to try
to make yourself
seem awesome to him,

142
00:07:23,189 --> 00:07:25,512
but that's wrong.
'Cause this isn't about you.

143
00:07:25,512 --> 00:07:29,047
This is a man
we're talking about.
It's always about him.

144
00:07:29,047 --> 00:07:31,268
Okay?
So, you're going to...

145
00:07:31,268 --> 00:07:34,164
I-- inflate his ego.

146
00:07:34,164 --> 00:07:37,620
Make him feel like
he's awesome, he's funny,

147
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:40,735
he's the most interesting
person in the room.

148
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:42,886
You're the most interesting
person in this room.

149
00:07:42,886 --> 00:07:45,583
Uhp, uhp, uhp. Hi.
Hello.

150
00:07:45,583 --> 00:07:47,435
I just wanted to come over
and introduce myself.

151
00:07:47,435 --> 00:07:48,953
I'm-I'm the manager
of the establishment.

152
00:07:48,953 --> 00:07:51,513
-Yes, I was just saying
that he's the most interesting
man in the room.

153
00:07:51,513 --> 00:07:55,671
Yeah. You know, it's--
I-I caught that, actually,
and I wanted to say to you

154
00:07:55,671 --> 00:07:59,167
that, uh, Mac does,
in fact, know everyone here,

155
00:07:59,167 --> 00:08:04,775
which he would, of course,
have to in order to have said
something like that.

156
00:08:04,775 --> 00:08:06,839
So, it's meaningful.

157
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:11,857
Now, once your man's
feeling important,
you're gonna show him
that you...

158
00:08:11,857 --> 00:08:15,568
N-- need his power.

159
00:08:15,568 --> 00:08:19,687
See, every man's greatest fear
is that he's a... pussy.

160
00:08:19,687 --> 00:08:22,299
- Mm.
-You need to make him
feel powerful.

161
00:08:22,299 --> 00:08:24,490
Oh, boy.

162
00:08:26,725 --> 00:08:28,914
Oh... man. I just can't seem
to get this open.

163
00:08:28,914 --> 00:08:31,497
- Do you think you could
help me out?
- Sure.

164
00:08:35,106 --> 00:08:37,327
Oh, this is really on tight.

165
00:08:37,327 --> 00:08:40,050
-Uh, are you-are you
being serious?

166
00:08:40,083 --> 00:08:41,920
Oh, Christ, Bozo, give it back
to me. I'll do it.

167
00:08:41,953 --> 00:08:44,024
Wai-- No, no. Uh, no.
Yeah, it's-- You can't.

168
00:08:44,058 --> 00:08:45,260
You can't. You couldn't.

169
00:08:45,293 --> 00:08:47,164
No one could,
because these bottles...

170
00:08:47,197 --> 00:08:49,536
are all, uh...

171
00:08:49,569 --> 00:08:51,707
they're defective
and un-openable.

172
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:53,276
Yeah, there's been a recall,
actually. See?

173
00:08:53,309 --> 00:08:55,715
It's-it's impossible.
Nobody could...

174
00:08:55,748 --> 00:08:58,319
...get these
open today.

175
00:08:58,352 --> 00:09:01,225
-Mm.
-You know what? You do look
very, very strong.

176
00:09:01,258 --> 00:09:04,198
You mind giving this
one more shot for me?

177
00:09:04,231 --> 00:09:06,903
Let's see if you can get it.

178
00:09:09,074 --> 00:09:10,110
-Wow.
-Wow.

179
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:14,284
Now that your man's
feeling powerful,

180
00:09:14,318 --> 00:09:16,355
on top of the world, you must...

181
00:09:16,388 --> 00:09:18,025
rip it away from him.

182
00:09:18,059 --> 00:09:21,098
You're going to N--
negate his power.

183
00:09:21,132 --> 00:09:23,837
Yeah, but this
needs to be subtle.

184
00:09:23,871 --> 00:09:26,075
A man's ego is... fragile.

185
00:09:26,108 --> 00:09:28,947
The goal here is to make him
feel that he may be a...

186
00:09:28,981 --> 00:09:30,316
tad bit inadequate,

187
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:32,755
in comparison, maybe,
to a former lover.

188
00:09:32,789 --> 00:09:33,824
-Yes?
-Oh.

189
00:09:33,857 --> 00:09:35,360
But don't lay it on too thick.

190
00:09:35,393 --> 00:09:37,865
-Mm. Mm-hmm.
-Subtle.

191
00:09:37,899 --> 00:09:40,036
I used to fuck LeBron James.

192
00:09:41,205 --> 00:09:42,809
Oh, God.

193
00:09:44,211 --> 00:09:45,681
Now, even if things have gone

194
00:09:45,714 --> 00:09:46,783
a little off the rails
at this point,

195
00:09:46,817 --> 00:09:48,052
we can get things back on track

196
00:09:48,085 --> 00:09:49,656
with a classic.

197
00:09:49,689 --> 00:09:53,129
E-- engage physically.

198
00:09:53,162 --> 00:09:54,933
-Hey-o.
-Yeah.

199
00:09:54,966 --> 00:09:57,070
But you got to make sure
that your physical engagement

200
00:09:57,104 --> 00:09:59,208
is appropriate
to the environment, okay?

201
00:09:59,241 --> 00:10:02,380
Your demeanor wants to remain
elegant and classy.

202
00:10:02,414 --> 00:10:04,218
-Right.
-Mm. Got it.

203
00:10:08,426 --> 00:10:10,130
What are you doing?

204
00:10:10,163 --> 00:10:12,668
I'm grabbing your ding-dong.

205
00:10:12,702 --> 00:10:14,004
No!

206
00:10:14,037 --> 00:10:16,242
No, yeah. That's, uh...

207
00:10:16,275 --> 00:10:18,112
And now for the final step,

208
00:10:18,146 --> 00:10:20,951
the most profound move
of the entire system.

209
00:10:22,354 --> 00:10:23,757
D.

210
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,696
"Do you want a tissue?"

211
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:28,801
-Huh?
-Huh?

212
00:10:28,834 --> 00:10:31,205
You see, with this one
simple but profound question,

213
00:10:31,238 --> 00:10:33,342
you instantly transport
this man back to a time

214
00:10:33,376 --> 00:10:35,313
when he was a tiny,
snot-nosed little bitch

215
00:10:35,346 --> 00:10:37,384
who depended on the most
important person in his life

216
00:10:37,417 --> 00:10:39,054
for absolutely everything.

217
00:10:39,087 --> 00:10:41,025
The person who inflated his ego,

218
00:10:41,058 --> 00:10:42,995
who made him feel powerful,

219
00:10:43,029 --> 00:10:44,732
but also powerless.

220
00:10:44,766 --> 00:10:46,770
The person whose validation

221
00:10:46,803 --> 00:10:49,876
he's been seeking
his entire life.

222
00:10:49,909 --> 00:10:50,878
Guys,

223
00:10:50,911 --> 00:10:52,314
the way to make a man

224
00:10:52,347 --> 00:10:54,017
fall in love with you

225
00:10:54,051 --> 00:10:56,388
is to make him feel

226
00:10:56,422 --> 00:10:58,861
like you are...

227
00:10:58,894 --> 00:11:01,332
his mommy.

228
00:11:01,365 --> 00:11:02,869
Well, it's getting late.

229
00:11:02,902 --> 00:11:04,739
Yeah.

230
00:11:04,772 --> 00:11:06,275
Yeah, we should
probably call it.

231
00:11:06,308 --> 00:11:09,081
I have, uh, one thing
that I'd like to ask you.

232
00:11:09,114 --> 00:11:11,953
Um... do you need a tissue?

233
00:11:11,987 --> 00:11:14,124
Do you need a tissue?

234
00:11:14,157 --> 00:11:16,028
-What?
-What?

235
00:11:16,061 --> 00:11:18,165
-You need a tissue.
-You need a tissue.

236
00:11:18,199 --> 00:11:20,938
Oh. Oh, really? Ah...

237
00:11:20,971 --> 00:11:22,808
Ah, just...
That's-that's embarrassing.

238
00:11:22,842 --> 00:11:24,411
-Hang on, all right, stop it.

239
00:11:24,444 --> 00:11:26,048
There we go. Come here.

240
00:11:26,081 --> 00:11:29,254
There we go. Now

241
00:11:29,288 --> 00:11:32,127
my little man
is all ready for his day.

242
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,830
Before, they wanted

243
00:11:33,864 --> 00:11:36,168
nothing more than
this date to be over.

244
00:11:36,202 --> 00:11:37,738
But now they can't help
but ask...

245
00:11:37,772 --> 00:11:41,111
Hey, um, any chance...

246
00:11:41,145 --> 00:11:42,380
Would you want to...

247
00:11:42,414 --> 00:11:43,449
...do this again...

248
00:11:43,482 --> 00:11:44,719
...sometime?

249
00:11:44,752 --> 00:11:45,888
Mm.

250
00:11:45,921 --> 00:11:47,090
It worked.

251
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:48,459
And there you have it.

252
00:11:48,493 --> 00:11:50,463
That, my friends, is...

253
00:11:50,497 --> 00:11:52,735
the SINNED system.

254
00:11:52,768 --> 00:11:53,971
-Oh!
-Whoa!

255
00:11:54,004 --> 00:11:55,440
-Oh, ho!
-Amazing.

256
00:11:55,473 --> 00:11:57,210
-Crazy creepy, though,
-Oh, yeah, very creepy.

257
00:11:57,244 --> 00:11:58,479
with all the mom stuff, and...

258
00:11:58,513 --> 00:12:00,016
the name's a little
heavy-handed.

259
00:12:00,049 --> 00:12:01,452
Yeah, took a-took a lot
to get there.

260
00:12:01,485 --> 00:12:03,322
It's not as clean
as the DENNIS system.

261
00:12:03,356 --> 00:12:05,026
Well, but listen,
the DENNIS system--

262
00:12:05,059 --> 00:12:06,462
that's a system
for getting a woman.

263
00:12:06,496 --> 00:12:07,965
This is a system
for getting a man,

264
00:12:07,999 --> 00:12:11,138
and that's why SINNED
is actually...

265
00:12:11,171 --> 00:12:12,742
-DENNIS backwards.

266
00:12:12,775 --> 00:12:16,181
Oh, my God!

267
00:12:16,215 --> 00:12:18,252
-That's amazing.
-How-how did that line up
like that?

268
00:12:18,286 --> 00:12:19,889
Yeah, like,
what are the odds, though?

269
00:12:19,923 --> 00:12:22,060
-Oh, wow.
-What do you-- The odds of what?

270
00:12:22,093 --> 00:12:23,997
What are the odds that
the steps to the system

271
00:12:24,031 --> 00:12:25,868
would be DENNIS backwards

272
00:12:25,901 --> 00:12:27,404
and that they would spell out
the word "sinned?"

273
00:12:27,437 --> 00:12:30,443
High! High.
'Cause I made it up.

274
00:12:30,476 --> 00:12:33,115
-Oh! Yeah, he did it on purpose.
-Oh, my... He made it up.

275
00:12:38,092 --> 00:12:40,363
-Hey-o!
-Hey-o!

276
00:12:40,396 --> 00:12:41,365
Hey, hey, hey!

277
00:12:41,398 --> 00:12:43,135
What's up, guy--

278
00:12:43,169 --> 00:12:44,539
You know what, I got to say,

279
00:12:44,572 --> 00:12:46,843
I am, I'm still, like,
buzzing from last night.

280
00:12:46,876 --> 00:12:48,513
-Got a little hairy there
for a second, didn't it?
- Yeah. Yeah.

281
00:12:48,547 --> 00:12:49,949
Yeah, but we pulled it off.

282
00:12:49,983 --> 00:12:50,985
-We sure did!
-We really did.

283
00:12:51,018 --> 00:12:52,287
-We really did.
-Success.

284
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,224
All right, so talk to me,
when are those

285
00:12:54,257 --> 00:12:55,494
-second dates?
-Ooh, yeah, no,
that's not happening.

286
00:12:55,527 --> 00:12:57,430
What do you mean,
that's not happening?

287
00:12:57,464 --> 00:12:59,836
Well, I got home last night,
and, I, uh, found myself

288
00:12:59,869 --> 00:13:02,374
real horny, so I popped
a couple of Mommy's magic beans

289
00:13:02,407 --> 00:13:04,044
and headed over to Kyle's house.

290
00:13:04,077 --> 00:13:07,017
Roofies. I roofied myself. Yeah,

291
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:08,887
not 100% sure
if we plowed or not,

292
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:10,991
but I do know I got this.

293
00:13:11,025 --> 00:13:12,427
You stole his phone.

294
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:14,298
-Yeah, well, I'll be honest,
-Aw...

295
00:13:14,331 --> 00:13:16,302
the details
are a bit hazy, still,

296
00:13:16,335 --> 00:13:18,406
but I do know
I stole somebody's phone.

297
00:13:18,439 --> 00:13:20,276
-And you?
-Oh, I'm not doing it either.

298
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:22,447
-Yeah!
-Okay, but I have
a good reason, Dennis.

299
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:25,253
I have a really good reason,
'cause I'm not a-a rapist

300
00:13:25,286 --> 00:13:27,925
and a thief like Dee is.
I'm-I'm just a boy in love.

301
00:13:27,958 --> 00:13:29,294
I'm just a boy
in love with Johnny,

302
00:13:29,328 --> 00:13:31,933
and I realized that
I-I have to be with him.

303
00:13:31,966 --> 00:13:33,870
Well, no, see,
that's-that's the thing--

304
00:13:33,904 --> 00:13:36,442
Johnny doesn't love you.
He doesn't even like you.

305
00:13:36,475 --> 00:13:38,446
-You don't know him.
-No, no, no.

306
00:13:38,479 --> 00:13:39,481
You don't know him.

307
00:13:39,515 --> 00:13:40,617
I know him better than you.

308
00:13:40,651 --> 00:13:42,287
Do you? Because I am him.

309
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:44,592
What?

310
00:13:44,625 --> 00:13:46,261
I invented Johnny as a means

311
00:13:46,295 --> 00:13:47,397
of getting you
out of the apartment

312
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:48,432
when you were irritating me.

313
00:13:48,466 --> 00:13:50,003
I don't understand.

314
00:13:50,036 --> 00:13:51,606
Okay, like,
when "Johnny" sent you out

315
00:13:51,639 --> 00:13:53,042
to go get those
soft-shell crabs,

316
00:13:53,075 --> 00:13:54,311
-you remember that?
-Yeah.

317
00:13:54,344 --> 00:13:56,048
Yeah. And he was
supposed to meet you,

318
00:13:56,081 --> 00:13:57,952
-but he didn't.
He ghosted you, right?
-No.

319
00:13:57,985 --> 00:14:00,156
And so, you came sauntering back
in the house and all depressed,

320
00:14:00,189 --> 00:14:01,893
and I was like,
"Well, I tell you what, buddy,

321
00:14:01,926 --> 00:14:05,033
I'll eat the soft-shell crabs.
They are my favorite."

322
00:14:05,066 --> 00:14:06,569
And I said, "Oh, my God,
what a coincidence

323
00:14:06,603 --> 00:14:09,074
because they're-they're
Johnny's favorite, too."

324
00:14:09,107 --> 00:14:11,178
-Yeah, because I am Johnny.
-Then who's Dennis?

325
00:14:11,211 --> 00:14:13,617
-What do you mean?
-Well, if you're Johnny,
then who-- who's you?

326
00:14:13,650 --> 00:14:15,587
I'm Dennis!
I've always been Dennis.

327
00:14:15,621 --> 00:14:18,025
L-L-Let me-- This is gonna make
it all clear. This is my phone,

328
00:14:18,059 --> 00:14:19,629
-Don't want to get into this--
-and when I push
a certain button...

329
00:14:19,662 --> 00:14:21,465
-Wait, hold on.
H-Hold on a second.

330
00:14:21,499 --> 00:14:23,436
-What, what?
-Johnny's buzzing me.
I got-- Look.

331
00:14:23,469 --> 00:14:25,440
-No, I pushed the button.
-I haven't heard
from him in a while,

332
00:14:25,473 --> 00:14:27,511
and I'm going to the motel.
I got to meet him.

333
00:14:27,545 --> 00:14:29,582
-I'm sorry.
-Mac, it's not Johnny. I pushed
the button on my phone--

334
00:14:29,615 --> 00:14:31,218
I can't engage with you
on this right now.

335
00:14:31,251 --> 00:14:33,089
I got to-I got to
go see Johnny.

336
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:35,093
Dennis! Dennis.
I need your help, man.

337
00:14:35,126 --> 00:14:36,261
-I need your help, big-time.
-No, no!

338
00:14:36,295 --> 00:14:37,932
I am done helping people.

339
00:14:37,965 --> 00:14:39,468
Dude, we're so close, man.
We're in the finals.

340
00:14:39,502 --> 00:14:41,205
-Yeah? I don't care.
-And there's no way

341
00:14:41,238 --> 00:14:42,942
I'm gonna be able to sneak a
restaurant buzzer in now.

342
00:14:42,975 --> 00:14:44,411
Okay, you know what?
You're not gonna stop talking.

343
00:14:44,444 --> 00:14:46,281
-So, I-I'm just...
-Yes-- No, I'm not, because,

344
00:14:46,315 --> 00:14:48,119
-Dennis, I need your help.
Look, I've
-I don't care.

345
00:14:48,152 --> 00:14:49,989
been controlling Frank using
the restaurant buzzer, okay?

346
00:14:50,022 --> 00:14:50,624
-Wait a-wait a-- whoa, what...
-And it's the perfect plan.

347
00:14:50,657 --> 00:14:52,293
Hold on a second.

348
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:56,335
Sorry, did you just say
you've been...

349
00:14:56,368 --> 00:15:00,143
controlling Frank
like a pawn in a game?

350
00:15:00,176 --> 00:15:02,515
Like a puppet?

351
00:15:02,548 --> 00:15:04,552
Uh, I didn't say
any of those words, but yeah.

352
00:15:04,585 --> 00:15:06,422
I've been-I've been controlling
Frank, uh, in chess, yes.

353
00:15:06,455 --> 00:15:08,159
Very interesting.

354
00:15:08,192 --> 00:15:11,265
And Frank's been aware
of the puppetry the entire time?

355
00:15:11,298 --> 00:15:13,503
Yeah, of course. He's in on it.
But dude, it's over, right?

356
00:15:13,537 --> 00:15:15,106
Unless you know a way
I can sneak

357
00:15:15,139 --> 00:15:17,611
something into this tournament
that vibrates.

358
00:15:20,016 --> 00:15:22,721
I think I may have a way,
but, uh...

359
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:24,357
Frank's not gonna like it.

360
00:15:25,661 --> 00:15:27,130
-Dee.
- Mm.

361
00:15:27,163 --> 00:15:28,967
Got any more
of those magic beans?

362
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,002
Yeah.

363
00:15:30,036 --> 00:15:31,038
'Cause we're gonna need

364
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:32,207
to turn the lights out.

365
00:15:37,685 --> 00:15:39,454
-Frank! Frank, get up!
- Wow, what...

366
00:15:39,488 --> 00:15:41,058
-Wake up! Wake up, man!
We're late!
-Okay. What?

367
00:15:41,091 --> 00:15:43,530
-We're gonna miss it, dude.

368
00:15:43,563 --> 00:15:45,466
-Move. No, out of the way.

369
00:15:45,501 --> 00:15:47,170
Jesus, Frank. Cutting it
pretty close there, pal.

370
00:15:47,203 --> 00:15:48,673
Ah, feel like
I got to take a shit.

371
00:15:48,707 --> 00:15:51,078
What? You got to sh--
Don't shit, don't shit.

372
00:15:51,111 --> 00:15:52,548
- No, no, no.
There's no time for that.
- I'm not ready for this.

373
00:15:52,581 --> 00:15:55,554
No, listen to me, listen to me.
You are ready.

374
00:15:55,587 --> 00:15:59,294
Everything you need
is already inside you.

375
00:15:59,327 --> 00:16:01,733
Move. No, out of the way.

376
00:16:10,183 --> 00:16:12,420
The excitement here is palpable.

377
00:16:12,453 --> 00:16:14,625
At last, the moment
we've all been waiting for,

378
00:16:14,659 --> 00:16:17,430
Mr. Reynolds is about
to make his first move.

379
00:16:17,463 --> 00:16:19,569
You got this, Frank!

380
00:16:19,602 --> 00:16:21,205
You got this, man!

381
00:16:23,777 --> 00:16:26,448
I don't know what I'm doing.

382
00:16:26,481 --> 00:16:28,687
Frank, trust your gut.

383
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,451
He seems a little
uncomfortable, Susan.

384
00:16:44,484 --> 00:16:46,488
Just think about
the incredible amount

385
00:16:46,523 --> 00:16:48,392
of pressure
he's feeling right now.

386
00:16:54,539 --> 00:16:56,609
-Ho, ho.

387
00:16:56,643 --> 00:16:58,379
Ho, ho!

388
00:16:58,412 --> 00:17:00,751
Yes. Yes.

389
00:17:03,422 --> 00:17:05,193
-Oh, God, no.
-[Susan] Mr. Reynolds seems
to be going through

390
00:17:05,226 --> 00:17:07,063
a range of emotions

391
00:17:07,096 --> 00:17:09,334
while contemplating
his first move.

392
00:17:09,367 --> 00:17:11,138
You don't have to do this.

393
00:17:11,171 --> 00:17:12,541
You don't have to do it.

394
00:17:12,575 --> 00:17:14,612
S-Should I go here?

395
00:17:17,417 --> 00:17:19,487
Uh... There?

396
00:17:26,134 --> 00:17:27,638
Take your time, take your time.

397
00:17:27,671 --> 00:17:31,512
Take your time. Take your time.

398
00:17:41,666 --> 00:17:43,737
You don't have to do this!

399
00:17:45,674 --> 00:17:47,678
Should I go there?
Aah!

400
00:17:54,224 --> 00:17:55,661
Hey, Dennis.

401
00:17:55,694 --> 00:17:57,531
Oh, man, I had
the craziest night last night,

402
00:17:57,564 --> 00:17:59,434
'cause I think I, like,
blacked out, and then,

403
00:17:59,467 --> 00:18:01,839
when I woke up, I think
that Johnny broke up with me,

404
00:18:01,873 --> 00:18:03,843
-'cause he was gone.
-Mac, I can't do this right now.

405
00:18:03,877 --> 00:18:05,446
-Here?

406
00:18:06,749 --> 00:18:08,419
Here?

407
00:18:08,452 --> 00:18:10,423
Don't lose your shit, man.
Don't lose your shit.

408
00:18:10,456 --> 00:18:12,327
A language warning
for anybody watching at home.

409
00:18:14,565 --> 00:18:16,301
-Nice.

410
00:18:16,335 --> 00:18:19,140
I am Johnny! I don't know
how else to tell you!

411
00:18:19,174 --> 00:18:21,746
Look, I have the texts.
I will show you the texts.

412
00:18:21,779 --> 00:18:25,453
Look, these are the texts that
I sent to you from my phone.

413
00:18:25,486 --> 00:18:28,425
Oh, my God.
You have Johnny's phone.

414
00:18:28,459 --> 00:18:30,162
-This is my...
-Give it to me.

415
00:18:30,196 --> 00:18:31,866
-Give me Johnny's phone.
-Goddamn it!
-Whoa, whoa.

416
00:18:36,776 --> 00:18:39,314
You motherfucker!

417
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,570
Oh, God.

418
00:18:50,604 --> 00:18:53,442
It won't...
it won't go down.

419
00:18:53,475 --> 00:18:55,514
What have you done?

420
00:18:55,547 --> 00:18:57,651
Take my king. Take my king.

421
00:18:57,685 --> 00:18:58,653
Take him.

422
00:18:58,687 --> 00:19:00,456
Take it. Take it.

423
00:19:11,713 --> 00:19:14,685
Kd2! Kd2!

424
00:19:14,719 --> 00:19:17,758

a brilliant endgame by Reynolds.

425
00:19:17,791 --> 00:19:20,463
