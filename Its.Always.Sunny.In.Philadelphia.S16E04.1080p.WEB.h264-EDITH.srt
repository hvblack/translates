1
00:00:07,458 --> 00:00:09,278
Frank!
Frank, come on, man!

2
00:00:09,278 --> 00:00:11,064
We got to go!
We got to go!

3
00:00:11,064 --> 00:00:13,326
-Oh, what?
- Come on, man,
we're gonna miss it.

4
00:00:13,326 --> 00:00:16,322
-Wake up, wake up. Come on.
-Wh-What?
-Right away!
-Okay.

5
00:00:16,322 --> 00:00:18,511
Guys, make way.
Make way, please.

6
00:00:18,511 --> 00:00:21,104
-Hey, wait, no, no, please.
-Cutting it
pretty close there, pal.

7
00:00:21,104 --> 00:00:23,936
Ah, I feel like
I got to take a shit.
- No, no, no, no, no.
There's no time for that.

8
00:00:23,936 --> 00:00:25,686
-Oh, God, excuse me. Come on.
- No, no, no, no,
no autographs.

9
00:00:25,686 --> 00:00:26,870
-I'm not ready for this.

10
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:28,607
-Listen, listen.
-You got it, you got it,
you got it.

11
00:00:28,607 --> 00:00:30,597
-Frank, you are ready.

12
00:00:30,597 --> 00:00:34,350
Everything you need
is already inside you.

13
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:37,063
Move. No, out of the way.

14
00:00:47,046 --> 00:00:49,928
VS

15
00:01:09,616 --> 00:01:11,441
-Dennis, please. Just...
-God, no.

16
00:01:11,441 --> 00:01:13,110
Please, please.
Pretty please, just help me.

17
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:16,244
No! No, Mac.
I'm not helping you, okay?

18
00:01:16,244 --> 00:01:17,819
Stop talking to me about Johnny.

19
00:01:17,819 --> 00:01:21,352
Well, hey, I could help you
with your guy troubles.

20
00:01:21,352 --> 00:01:23,466
No, thanks, Dee.
You suck with men.

21
00:01:23,466 --> 00:01:25,813
Tell that to the guy leaving
my apartment this morning.

22
00:01:25,813 --> 00:01:29,431
That's right. Your girl
got her guts pumped last night.

23
00:01:29,431 --> 00:01:32,320
Oh, my God, that is disgusting.
-Your guts pumped?

24
00:01:32,386 --> 00:01:34,727
-Aren't you, like, 60?
You're not a girl.

25
00:01:34,793 --> 00:01:37,221
-Yeah, come on, Dee.
This is insane.
-I mean... really.
-Who talks like that?

26
00:01:37,221 --> 00:01:40,115
And, by the way, anybody can
get a guy to bang them once.

27
00:01:40,115 --> 00:01:43,846
Okay, well, I guarantee you
he'll be coming back
for seconds.

28
00:01:43,846 --> 00:01:46,748
In fact, he pulled
an old move of mine.

29
00:01:46,748 --> 00:01:49,328
He took my phone "by mistake"

30
00:01:49,362 --> 00:01:50,551
so that he could see me again.

31
00:01:50,551 --> 00:01:54,737
Oh, okay. Yeah.
How's he gonna call you?

32
00:01:57,554 --> 00:01:59,166
-Dennis, can you
help me get my phone--
-No.

33
00:01:59,166 --> 00:02:01,554
-Dennis, Dennis, I need
your help really quick, man.
-No!

34
00:02:01,554 --> 00:02:03,551
Do you remember when we stole a
restaurant buzzer the other day?

35
00:02:03,551 --> 00:02:06,279
I can't find it anywhere.
It's a matter of
national security here, man.

36
00:02:06,279 --> 00:02:07,674
Oh, yes, no, no, I'm sure, yeah.

37
00:02:07,674 --> 00:02:10,686
You know what? Maybe it's in
the back office. Let me check
the back office. Frank,
let me check the back office.

38
00:02:10,686 --> 00:02:12,818
Hey, uh, Frank, could you
help me with something?
-Yeah.

39
00:02:12,818 --> 00:02:17,270
-Are you kidding?
You want Frank's help
with your guy troubles?
He's insanely homophobic.

40
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:21,376
Huh? Not anymore.
No, once Mac did the dance,

41
00:02:21,376 --> 00:02:24,217
- then I get it. I get the gay thing.
- He gets it. He's an ally now.

42
00:02:24,217 --> 00:02:26,455
Okay, so, Frank, I need
some relationship advice.

43
00:02:26,455 --> 00:02:28,872
-I'm having some issues
with this guy that I'm dating.

44
00:02:28,872 --> 00:02:32,713
-I want to take it
to the next level, you know,
by actually meeting this guy.

45
00:02:32,713 --> 00:02:36,625
- What, you've never met the guy?
- No, never met him,
never spoken with him,
never seen him,

46
00:02:36,625 --> 00:02:40,797
but it's not weird
because we're in
constant communication
through the beads.

47
00:02:41,214 --> 00:02:45,834
- The beads?
- Oh, yes.
The extra-large anal beads
that I shoved up my butt,

48
00:02:45,834 --> 00:02:49,843
and Johnny can control them
via an app on his phone.

49
00:02:49,843 --> 00:02:53,448
And when I feel the buzz,
I know it's time
to go to the motel
and wait.

50
00:02:53,448 --> 00:02:54,855
It's very romantic.

51
00:02:54,855 --> 00:02:58,058
Uh, yes, he's never
actually showed up before,

52
00:02:58,058 --> 00:03:01,567
but one day he will,
and it's going to be hot.

53
00:03:01,567 --> 00:03:04,054
That's it.
I'm out.

54
00:03:04,054 --> 00:03:07,711
I'm out. That's it. I don't
get it. I am never gonna get it.

55
00:03:07,711 --> 00:03:10,151
-Beads? You never said
anything about beads.
-Let me-let me explain it again.

56
00:03:10,151 --> 00:03:11,824
It's beads that go into my ass.

57
00:03:11,824 --> 00:03:14,240
The dance never said anything
about no beads.

58
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:17,730
- Frank, I found it. I found it.
I found it.
- Let's get the hell out of here.

59
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:18,902
We got it, guys, we're good.

60
00:03:18,902 --> 00:03:20,150
Anal beads up his ass.

61
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:22,527
Dennis, can you please help me
get my phone back?
'Cause I need my phone.

62
00:03:22,527 --> 00:03:23,903
No, Dennis, help
me, though. Help me because
-I need help--

63
00:03:23,903 --> 00:03:27,107
-No, you are beyond help, okay?
You let a stranger
hack your butthole. Dennis--

64
00:03:27,107 --> 00:03:28,919
Enough! Enough.

65
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:32,162
It is clear that I'm not going
to get a moment's peace

66
00:03:32,162 --> 00:03:35,695
until I foist you two
off on someone else,
so, fine, I will help you.

67
00:03:35,695 --> 00:03:38,353
-Okay. Okay.
-Oh, yeah! All right, all right,
let's go.

68
00:03:39,972 --> 00:03:43,919
- This is all I could find.
- Yeah, no, this is good. Um...

69
00:03:43,974 --> 00:03:47,822
Okay, are there, like, a pair
of, like, weird spy glasses
in here or anything?

70
00:03:47,822 --> 00:03:50,587
-Aw, shit.
-They dropped all those charges
weeks ago. Wh--

71
00:03:50,587 --> 00:03:52,197
Call you back.

72
00:03:52,197 --> 00:03:55,109
Hey, what are you guys doing
with all my research equipment?

73
00:03:55,109 --> 00:03:57,034
Charlie and Frank
are gonna play spies.

74
00:03:57,034 --> 00:03:59,157
Yeah, well, we're not
playing spies,
we're playing chess, okay?

75
00:03:59,157 --> 00:04:02,308
There's a Russian grandmaster
coming to town.
I'm entering Frank
in the tournament,

76
00:04:02,308 --> 00:04:06,351
and then he's gonna
rise through the ranks,
and he's gonna beat
this guy's ass, USA style.

77
00:04:06,418 --> 00:04:09,682
So, I need the glasses,
Uncle Jack,
because Frank's got to be able
to transmit me the board

78
00:04:09,682 --> 00:04:13,066
while I play along
on a computer
and I signal him the moves
with the restaurant buzzer.

79
00:04:13,066 --> 00:04:17,270
No, stop, stop, stop.
Uh, you're gonna break it.
This is, uh,
very sensitive equipment.

80
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:20,571
Right, yeah, okay.
Look, do you have
the spy glasses or not, dude?

81
00:04:20,571 --> 00:04:24,410
Fine. I'll let you borrow them,
but I'm coming with.
Okay? I don't want you
breaking any of this.

82
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:25,830
-A play date.

83
00:04:25,924 --> 00:04:28,004
-Goddamn it.
-Oh, yeah. Like we used to.

84
00:04:28,004 --> 00:04:29,074
-We never did.

85
00:04:29,074 --> 00:04:32,310
-Man, we never did.
- You don't remember.

86
00:04:33,513 --> 00:04:37,858
I mean, what is taking
Uncle Jack so long?
-Well, why don't we just go in?

87
00:04:37,858 --> 00:04:39,741
Hang on.

88
00:04:43,414 --> 00:04:45,229
-What the...
-Is that-is that him?

89
00:04:45,229 --> 00:04:47,358
Holy shit.

90
00:04:47,428 --> 00:04:50,244
Uh, Uncle Jack,
what-what is this?

91
00:04:50,244 --> 00:04:51,656
-My ice cream truck.

92
00:04:51,656 --> 00:04:54,728
You know, I-I have, like,
a side business.

93
00:04:54,728 --> 00:04:57,645
Ugh. All right, fine. You know
what? Actually, this could work.

94
00:04:57,645 --> 00:04:59,692
-You got the spy glasses?
-Yeah. Here they are.
-Glasses.

95
00:04:59,692 --> 00:05:01,965
-Here's how this goes.
Frank, you got the buzzer?
-Yeah, I got the buzzer.

96
00:05:01,965 --> 00:05:04,005
-All right, so Frank's got
a buzzer in his pocket, okay?
-I'm gonna put it in my pocket.

97
00:05:04,005 --> 00:05:07,997
So, he'll hover his hand
over the piece, you know,
one buzz for yes,
two buzzes for no,

98
00:05:07,997 --> 00:05:09,913
three if you need him to switch
to a different piece, okay?

99
00:05:09,913 --> 00:05:11,824
Same goes for where
to put it down. Got it?
-Okay.

100
00:05:11,824 --> 00:05:12,619
-You clear?
- Yup.

101
00:05:12,619 --> 00:05:14,533
-Give me a Push Pop, will you?
-And get him a Push Pop.

102
00:05:14,533 --> 00:05:17,369
What? Oh, no, I-I don't have
any ice cream.

103
00:05:17,369 --> 00:05:20,601
-Oh, my God. All right, fine.
Just... just...

104
00:05:20,601 --> 00:05:22,794
-get to your spot
and play the-- Ugh.
- Okay.

105
00:05:22,794 --> 00:05:25,179
Hey, I'll be watching you.

106
00:05:29,059 --> 00:05:31,834
Should I go here?

107
00:05:31,834 --> 00:05:36,024
-Mm. Or should I go...
here?

108
00:05:36,024 --> 00:05:38,478
Charlie, don't look at the kid,
look at the board.

109
00:05:38,478 --> 00:05:41,617
Actually,
one quick look at the kid again,
so I can get a screen grab.

110
00:05:41,617 --> 00:05:42,942
-Gross, no, man, no.

111
00:05:42,942 --> 00:05:45,103
-No? No?
- I-- No, not you. Sorry.

112
00:05:45,103 --> 00:05:46,853
Talking to the voices
in my head, so...

113
00:05:46,853 --> 00:05:48,916
-Stay on the board.
-Yup. Yes.

114
00:05:48,916 --> 00:05:51,893
- Don't mind my friend.
He's schizophrenic.
-I am, yeah.

115
00:05:51,893 --> 00:05:53,646
- Got it.

116
00:05:56,563 --> 00:05:59,911
Boom.
I took your little
castle-y thing.

117
00:05:59,911 --> 00:06:02,202
Suck on that,
boy!

118
00:06:02,202 --> 00:06:05,034
If he does, let me get
another screen grab.

119
00:06:05,034 --> 00:06:07,572
Shut up, dude.
That's gross, man.

120
00:06:07,572 --> 00:06:10,777
-Sir?
Uh, sir, may I have
a word with you?

121
00:06:10,777 --> 00:06:13,650
Um, absolutely not because
I'm in the middle of watching
a game of chess.

122
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:16,606
Uh, there is no alcohol allowed
on the premises.

123
00:06:16,606 --> 00:06:20,169
What? Wh-What do you mean?
Like, I got to drink wine
or something?

124
00:06:20,169 --> 00:06:23,094
No alcohol at all.
At a sporting event?

125
00:06:23,094 --> 00:06:25,987
That's crazy.
Fine, dude. Here you go.

126
00:06:25,987 --> 00:06:28,844
Frank, I'm gonna have to find
some way to sneak beer in here.

127
00:06:28,844 --> 00:06:32,348
- Excuse me?
- Dude, are you still here?
Go away.

128
00:06:32,348 --> 00:06:35,321
I gave you the beer, man.

129
00:06:38,474 --> 00:06:42,546
Now, as you're both aware,
I have a foolproof system
for attracting a woman.

130
00:06:42,546 --> 00:06:47,549
But I also have
a foolproof system
for attracting a man.

131
00:06:47,549 --> 00:06:50,268
-Aw, awesome.
-No way.

132
00:06:50,334 --> 00:06:52,668
-Why?
-How come?
-Shh, shh.

133
00:06:54,674 --> 00:06:58,108
Okay.
Now, it begins
with me setting you both up

134
00:06:58,108 --> 00:07:00,930
with nice, normal dates.

135
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:04,495
You will begin by greeting them
with the traditional
pleasantries.

136
00:07:04,495 --> 00:07:05,663
Very nice to meet you, Patrick.

137
00:07:05,663 --> 00:07:08,791
- Kyle, it's a pleasure.
- Pleasure's all mine.

138
00:07:08,791 --> 00:07:12,544
I'll be nearby, of course,
to make sure nothing goes awry.

139
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:15,892
Step one.

140
00:07:15,892 --> 00:07:18,912
S-- suppress your instincts.

141
00:07:18,912 --> 00:07:23,189
See, your first instinct
is going to be to try
to make yourself
seem awesome to him,

142
00:07:23,189 --> 00:07:25,512
but that's wrong.
'Cause this isn't about you.

143
00:07:25,512 --> 00:07:29,047
This is a man
we're talking about.
It's always about him.

144
00:07:29,047 --> 00:07:31,268
Okay?
So, you're going to...

145
00:07:31,268 --> 00:07:34,164
I-- inflate his ego.

146
00:07:34,164 --> 00:07:37,620
Make him feel like
he's awesome, he's funny,

147
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:40,735
he's the most interesting
person in the room.

148
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:42,886
You're the most interesting
person in this room.

149
00:07:42,886 --> 00:07:45,583
Uhp, uhp, uhp. Hi.
Hello.

150
00:07:45,583 --> 00:07:47,435
I just wanted to come over
and introduce myself.

151
00:07:47,435 --> 00:07:48,953
I'm-I'm the manager
of the establishment.

152
00:07:48,953 --> 00:07:51,513
-Yes, I was just saying
that he's the most interesting
man in the room.

153
00:07:51,513 --> 00:07:55,671
Yeah. You know, it's--
I-I caught that, actually,
and I wanted to say to you

154
00:07:55,671 --> 00:07:59,167
that, uh, Mac does,
in fact, know everyone here,

155
00:07:59,167 --> 00:08:04,775
which he would, of course,
have to in order to have said
something like that.

156
00:08:04,775 --> 00:08:06,839
So, it's meaningful.

157
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:11,857
Now, once your man's
feeling important,
you're gonna show him
that you...

158
00:08:11,857 --> 00:08:15,568
N-- need his power.

159
00:08:15,568 --> 00:08:19,687
See, every man's greatest fear
is that he's a... pussy.

160
00:08:19,687 --> 00:08:22,299
- Mm.
-You need to make him
feel powerful.

161
00:08:22,299 --> 00:08:24,490
Oh, boy.

162
00:08:26,725 --> 00:08:28,914
Oh... man. I just can't seem
to get this open.

163
00:08:28,914 --> 00:08:31,497
- Do you think you could
help me out?
- Sure.

164
00:08:35,106 --> 00:08:37,327
Oh, this is really on tight.

165
00:08:37,327 --> 00:08:39,715
-Uh, are you-are you
being serious?

166
00:08:39,715 --> 00:08:41,833
Oh, Christ, Bozo, give it back
to me. I'll do it.

167
00:08:41,833 --> 00:08:44,634
Wai-- No, no. Uh, no.
Yeah, it's-- You can't. You can't.

168
00:08:44,703 --> 00:08:49,299
You couldn't.
No one could,
because these bottles...
are all, uh...

169
00:08:49,299 --> 00:08:51,508
they're defective
and un-openable.

170
00:08:51,508 --> 00:08:53,379
Yeah, there's been a recall,
actually. See?

171
00:08:53,379 --> 00:08:57,639
It's-it's impossible.
Nobody could...
...get these
open today.

172
00:08:58,084 --> 00:09:01,471
-You know what? You do look
very, very strong.

173
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:03,973
You mind giving this
one more shot for me?

174
00:09:03,973 --> 00:09:06,157
Let's see if you can get it.

175
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:10,675
-Wow.
-Wow.

176
00:09:12,237 --> 00:09:16,176
Now that your man's
feeling powerful,
on top of the world, you must...

177
00:09:16,176 --> 00:09:17,757
rip it away from him.

178
00:09:17,757 --> 00:09:21,521
You're going to N--
negate his power.

179
00:09:21,616 --> 00:09:23,109
Yeah, but this
needs to be subtle.

180
00:09:23,109 --> 00:09:25,737
A man's ego is... fragile.

181
00:09:25,737 --> 00:09:28,487
The goal here is to make him
feel that he may be a...

182
00:09:28,487 --> 00:09:33,242
tad bit inadequate,
in comparison, maybe,
to a former lover.

183
00:09:33,242 --> 00:09:36,106
But don't lay it on too thick.

184
00:09:36,106 --> 00:09:37,895
-Mm. Mm-hmm.
-Subtle.

185
00:09:37,895 --> 00:09:40,651
I used to fuck LeBron James.

186
00:09:40,651 --> 00:09:42,953
Oh, God.

187
00:09:43,693 --> 00:09:46,833
Now, even if things have gone
a little off the rails
at this point,

188
00:09:46,833 --> 00:09:49,104
we can get things back on track
with a classic.

189
00:09:49,104 --> 00:09:53,832
E-- engage physically.
-Hey-o.

190
00:09:53,832 --> 00:09:58,973
But you got to make sure
that your physical engagement
is appropriate
to the environment, okay?

191
00:09:58,973 --> 00:10:02,456
Your demeanor wants to remain
elegant and classy.

192
00:10:02,456 --> 00:10:04,600
-Right.
-Mm. Got it.

193
00:10:08,759 --> 00:10:12,480
- What are you doing?
- I'm grabbing your ding-dong.

194
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,529
No!

195
00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:16,023
No, yeah. That's, uh...

196
00:10:16,023 --> 00:10:18,112
And now for the final step,

197
00:10:18,146 --> 00:10:21,719
the most profound move
of the entire system.

198
00:10:21,869 --> 00:10:23,837
D.

199
00:10:24,725 --> 00:10:26,983
"Do you want a tissue?"

200
00:10:26,983 --> 00:10:28,242
-Huh?
-Huh?

201
00:10:28,242 --> 00:10:31,174
You see, with this one
simple but profound question,

202
00:10:31,174 --> 00:10:35,323
you instantly transport
this man back to a time
when he was a tiny,
snot-nosed little bitch

203
00:10:35,323 --> 00:10:38,764
who depended on the most
important person in his life
for absolutely everything.

204
00:10:38,764 --> 00:10:40,880
The person who inflated his ego,

205
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:44,281
who made him feel powerful,
but also powerless.

206
00:10:44,281 --> 00:10:49,906
The person whose validation
he's been seeking
his entire life.

207
00:10:49,906 --> 00:10:53,413
Guys,
the way to make a man
fall in love with you

208
00:10:53,413 --> 00:10:55,539
is to make him feel

209
00:10:55,539 --> 00:11:01,344
like you are...
his mommy.

210
00:11:01,344 --> 00:11:02,966
Well, it's getting late.

211
00:11:02,966 --> 00:11:06,037
Yeah.
Yeah, we should
probably call it.

212
00:11:06,037 --> 00:11:09,734
I have, uh, one thing
that I'd like to ask you.

213
00:11:09,734 --> 00:11:12,142
Um... do you need a tissue?

214
00:11:12,142 --> 00:11:14,287
Do you need a tissue?

215
00:11:14,287 --> 00:11:15,768
-What?
-What?

216
00:11:15,768 --> 00:11:18,078
-You need a tissue.
-You need a tissue.

217
00:11:18,078 --> 00:11:20,704
Oh. Oh, really? Ah...

218
00:11:20,774 --> 00:11:22,630
Ah, just...
That's-that's embarrassing.

219
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:24,111
-Hang on, all right, stop it.

220
00:11:24,111 --> 00:11:26,361
There we go. Come here.

221
00:11:26,361 --> 00:11:28,256
There we go.

222
00:11:28,256 --> 00:11:32,030
Now my little man
is all ready for his day.

223
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:35,416
Before, they wanted
nothing more than
this date to be over.

224
00:11:35,416 --> 00:11:37,838
But now they can't help
but ask...

225
00:11:37,838 --> 00:11:41,158
Hey, um, any chance...

226
00:11:41,262 --> 00:11:42,348
Would you want to...

227
00:11:42,348 --> 00:11:43,475
...do this again...

228
00:11:43,475 --> 00:11:44,946
...sometime?

229
00:11:45,786 --> 00:11:47,002
It worked.

230
00:11:47,002 --> 00:11:48,101
And there you have it.

231
00:11:48,101 --> 00:11:50,216
That, my friends, is...

232
00:11:50,216 --> 00:11:53,112
the SINNED system.

233
00:11:53,672 --> 00:11:55,349
-Oh, ho!
-Amazing.

234
00:11:55,349 --> 00:11:58,049
-Crazy creepy, though, with all the mom stuff, and...
-Oh, yeah, very creepy.


235
00:11:58,049 --> 00:12:01,424
- the name's a little
heavy-handed.
- Yeah, took a-took a lot
to get there.

236
00:12:01,424 --> 00:12:03,337
It's not as clean
as the DENNIS system.

237
00:12:03,337 --> 00:12:06,286
Well, but listen,
the DENNIS system--
that's a system
for getting a woman.

238
00:12:06,286 --> 00:12:10,465
This is a system
for getting a man,
and that's why SINNED
is actually...

239
00:12:10,465 --> 00:12:12,737
-DENNIS backwards.

240
00:12:12,737 --> 00:12:16,744
Oh, my God!
That's amazing.

241
00:12:16,744 --> 00:12:20,399
-How-how did that line up
like that?
- Yeah, like,
what are the odds, though?

242
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:23,796
-What do you-- The odds of what?
What are the odds that
the steps to the system

243
00:12:23,796 --> 00:12:27,347
would be DENNIS backwards
and that they would spell out
the word "sinned?"

244
00:12:27,347 --> 00:12:30,646
High! High.
'Cause I made it up.

245
00:12:30,646 --> 00:12:34,978
-Oh! Yeah, he did it on purpose.
-Oh, my... He made it up.

246
00:12:37,992 --> 00:12:40,198
-Hey-o!
-Hey-o!

247
00:12:40,198 --> 00:12:43,396
Hey, hey, hey!
What's up, guy--

248
00:12:43,396 --> 00:12:44,539
You know what, I got to say,

249
00:12:44,572 --> 00:12:46,635
I am, I'm still, like,
buzzing from last night.

250
00:12:46,635 --> 00:12:49,557
-Got a little hairy there
for a second, didn't it?
Yeah, but we pulled it off.

251
00:12:49,557 --> 00:12:52,059
-We sure did!
-We really did.
-We really did.
-Success.

252
00:12:52,059 --> 00:12:53,637
All right, so talk to me,
when are those second dates?

253
00:12:53,637 --> 00:12:57,493
-Ooh, yeah, no,
that's not happening.
- What do you mean,
that's not happening?

254
00:12:57,493 --> 00:13:00,120
Well, I got home last night,
and, I, uh, found myself real horny, 

255
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:04,033
so I popped
a couple of Mommy's magic beans
and headed over to Kyle's house.

256
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:05,923
Roofies. I roofied myself. 

257
00:13:05,923 --> 00:13:11,031
Yeah, not 100% sure
if we plowed or not,
but I do know I got this.

258
00:13:11,031 --> 00:13:12,482
You stole his phone.

259
00:13:12,482 --> 00:13:16,175
-Yeah, well, I'll be honest,
the details
are a bit hazy, still,

260
00:13:16,175 --> 00:13:18,479
but I do know
I stole somebody's phone.

261
00:13:18,479 --> 00:13:20,640
-And you?
-Oh, I'm not doing it either.

262
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:23,758
-Okay, but I have
a good reason, Dennis.
I have a really good reason,

263
00:13:23,758 --> 00:13:26,251
'cause I'm not a-a rapist
and a thief like Dee is.

264
00:13:26,251 --> 00:13:29,062
I'm-I'm just a boy in love.
I'm just a boy
in love with Johnny,

265
00:13:29,062 --> 00:13:31,508
and I realized that
I-I have to be with him.

266
00:13:31,508 --> 00:13:33,870
Well, no, see,
that's-that's the thing--

267
00:13:33,904 --> 00:13:36,387
Johnny doesn't love you.
He doesn't even like you.

268
00:13:36,387 --> 00:13:39,516
-You don't know him.
-No, no, no. You don't know him.

269
00:13:39,516 --> 00:13:43,126
- I know him better than you.
- Do you? Because I am him.

270
00:13:43,126 --> 00:13:48,428
- What?
- I invented Johnny as a means
of getting you
out of the apartment
when you were irritating me.

271
00:13:48,428 --> 00:13:49,724
I don't understand.

272
00:13:49,724 --> 00:13:53,819
Okay, like,
when "Johnny" sent you out
to go get those
soft-shell crabs,
you remember that?

273
00:13:53,819 --> 00:13:57,249
Yeah. And he was
supposed to meet you,
but he didn't.
He ghosted you, right?

274
00:13:57,249 --> 00:13:59,982
And so, you came sauntering back
in the house and all depressed,

275
00:13:59,982 --> 00:14:04,678
and I was like,
"Well, I tell you what, buddy,
I'll eat the soft-shell crabs.
They are my favorite."

276
00:14:04,678 --> 00:14:08,745
And I said, "Oh, my God,
what a coincidence
because they're-they're
Johnny's favorite, too."

277
00:14:08,745 --> 00:14:11,154
-Yeah, because I am Johnny.
-Then who's Dennis?

278
00:14:11,154 --> 00:14:13,651
-What do you mean?
-Well, if you're Johnny,
then who-- who's you?

279
00:14:13,651 --> 00:14:15,787
I'm Dennis!
I've always been Dennis.

280
00:14:15,787 --> 00:14:17,979
L-L-Let me-- This is gonna make
it all clear. This is my phone,

281
00:14:17,979 --> 00:14:19,669
-Don't want to get into this--
-and when I push
a certain button...

282
00:14:19,669 --> 00:14:21,251
-Wait, hold on.
H-Hold on a second.

283
00:14:21,251 --> 00:14:23,215
-What, what?
-Johnny's buzzing me.
I got-- Look.

284
00:14:23,215 --> 00:14:25,813
-No, I pushed the button.
-I haven't heard
from him in a while,

285
00:14:25,813 --> 00:14:27,447
and I'm going to the motel.
I got to meet him.

286
00:14:27,447 --> 00:14:29,462
-Mac, it's not Johnny. I pushed
the button on my phone--

287
00:14:29,462 --> 00:14:32,228
I can't engage with you
on this right now.
I got to-I got to
go see Johnny.

288
00:14:32,290 --> 00:14:35,092
Dennis! Dennis.
I need your help, man.

289
00:14:35,092 --> 00:14:37,391
-I need your help, big-time.
-No, no!
I am done helping people.

290
00:14:37,391 --> 00:14:39,280
Dude, we're so close, man.
We're in the finals.

291
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:42,729
-Yeah? I don't care.
-And there's no way
I'm gonna be able to sneak a
restaurant buzzer in now.

292
00:14:42,729 --> 00:14:44,537
Okay, you know what?
You're not gonna stop talking.

293
00:14:44,537 --> 00:14:46,035
-Yes-- No, I'm not, because,
Dennis, I need your help.

294
00:14:46,035 --> 00:14:48,970
-I don't care.
- been controlling Frank using
the restaurant buzzer, okay?

295
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:50,857
-Wait a-wait a-- whoa, what...
-And it's the perfect plan.

296
00:14:50,857 --> 00:14:52,845
Hold on a second.

297
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:55,930
Sorry, did you just say
you've been...

298
00:14:55,930 --> 00:15:00,157
controlling Frank
like a pawn in a game?

299
00:15:00,157 --> 00:15:02,558
Like a puppet?

300
00:15:02,558 --> 00:15:04,654
Uh, I didn't say
any of those words, but yeah.

301
00:15:04,654 --> 00:15:06,956
I've been-I've been controlling
Frank, uh, in chess, yes.

302
00:15:06,956 --> 00:15:08,159
Very interesting.

303
00:15:08,192 --> 00:15:10,799
And Frank's been aware
of the puppetry the entire time?

304
00:15:10,799 --> 00:15:13,663
Yeah, of course. He's in on it.
But dude, it's over, right?

305
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:17,560
Unless you know a way
I can sneak
something into this tournament
that vibrates.

306
00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:22,560
I think I may have a way,
but, uh...

307
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,989
Frank's not gonna like it.

308
00:15:25,361 --> 00:15:28,726
-Dee.
Got any more
of those magic beans?

309
00:15:28,726 --> 00:15:33,340
Yeah.
'Cause we're gonna need
to turn the lights out.

310
00:15:35,745 --> 00:15:38,383
-Frank! Frank, get up!
- Wow, what...

311
00:15:38,383 --> 00:15:41,361
-Wake up! Wake up, man!
We're late!
-Okay. What?

312
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:43,108
-We're gonna miss it, dude.

313
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:45,373
-Move. No, out of the way.

314
00:15:45,373 --> 00:15:47,618
Jesus, Frank. Cutting it
pretty close there, pal.

315
00:15:47,618 --> 00:15:49,293
Ah, feel like
I got to take a shit.

316
00:15:49,293 --> 00:15:51,324
Don't shit, don't shit.
- No, no, no. There's no time for that.

317
00:15:51,324 --> 00:15:53,653
- I'm not ready for this.
- No, listen to me, listen to me.

318
00:15:53,653 --> 00:15:58,875
You are ready.
Everything you need
is already inside you.

319
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:01,985
Move. No, out of the way.

320
00:16:09,683 --> 00:16:12,261
The excitement here is palpable.

321
00:16:12,261 --> 00:16:14,762
At last, the moment
we've all been waiting for,

322
00:16:14,762 --> 00:16:18,005
Mr. Reynolds is about
to make his first move.

323
00:16:18,005 --> 00:16:21,456
You got this, Frank!
You got this, man!

324
00:16:23,549 --> 00:16:25,612
I don't know what I'm doing.

325
00:16:25,612 --> 00:16:28,480
Frank, trust your gut.

326
00:16:41,651 --> 00:16:44,507
He seems a little
uncomfortable, Susan.

327
00:16:44,507 --> 00:16:49,101
Just think about
the incredible amount
of pressure
he's feeling right now.

328
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:01,575
Yes. Yes.

329
00:17:02,822 --> 00:17:06,661
Mr. Reynolds seems
to be going through
a range of emotions

330
00:17:06,661 --> 00:17:09,046
while contemplating
his first move.

331
00:17:09,046 --> 00:17:12,548
You don't have to do this.
You don't have to do it.

332
00:17:12,548 --> 00:17:15,143
S-Should I go here?

333
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:20,005
Uh... There?

334
00:17:25,734 --> 00:17:32,203
Take your time, take your time.
Take your time. Take your time.

335
00:17:41,522 --> 00:17:44,648
You don't have to do this!

336
00:17:45,387 --> 00:17:47,634
Should I go there?

337
00:17:54,224 --> 00:17:57,813
Hey, Dennis.
Oh, man, I had
the craziest night last night,

338
00:17:57,813 --> 00:18:02,522
'cause I think I, like,
blacked out, and then,
when I woke up, I think
that Johnny broke up with me,
'cause he was gone.

339
00:18:02,522 --> 00:18:04,051
-Mac, I can't do this right now.

340
00:18:04,117 --> 00:18:06,273
-Here?

341
00:18:07,011 --> 00:18:08,039
Here?

342
00:18:08,039 --> 00:18:10,098
Don't lose your shit, man.
Don't lose your shit.

343
00:18:10,098 --> 00:18:13,059
A language warning
for anybody watching at home.

344
00:18:15,003 --> 00:18:16,376
-Nice.

345
00:18:16,376 --> 00:18:19,641
I am Johnny! I don't know
how else to tell you!

346
00:18:19,641 --> 00:18:21,902
Look, I have the texts.
I will show you the texts.

347
00:18:21,902 --> 00:18:25,550
Look, these are the texts that
I sent to you from my phone.

348
00:18:25,550 --> 00:18:28,564
Oh, my God.
You have Johnny's phone.

349
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:32,484
-This is my...
-Give it to me.
Give me Johnny's phone.

350
00:18:36,576 --> 00:18:39,857
You motherfucker!

351
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,192
Oh, God.

352
00:18:50,192 --> 00:18:53,545
It won't...
it won't go down.

353
00:18:53,545 --> 00:18:55,377
What have you done?

354
00:18:55,377 --> 00:18:57,855
Take my king. Take my king.

355
00:18:57,855 --> 00:19:00,915
Take him.
Take it. Take it.

356
00:19:12,038 --> 00:19:15,314
Kd2! Kd2!
That is checkmate. 

357
00:19:15,314 --> 00:19:17,598
What
a brilliant endgame by Reynolds.

358
00:19:17,598 --> 00:19:19,762
-He won?
-He won!

359
00:19:19,843 --> 00:19:22,119
-Frank won?

360
00:19:25,174 --> 00:19:27,459
Get it out! Get it out!

361
00:19:27,459 --> 00:19:30,854
-You did it, Frank!
Frank, you did it!
You beat the Russian!

362
00:19:30,941 --> 00:19:33,161
-You beat the Russian!

363
00:19:33,585 --> 00:19:35,671
 It's gonna
split me in half, Charlie.

364
00:19:35,671 --> 00:19:37,522
-He won! He won!

365
00:19:37,522 --> 00:19:43,667
-USA! USA!
-Kill the Wi-Fi! Kill the Wi-Fi!
-USA! USA!
-Kill it. Kill the Wi-Fi!
