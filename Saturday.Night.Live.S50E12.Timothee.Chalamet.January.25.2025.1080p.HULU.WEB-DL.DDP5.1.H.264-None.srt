1
00:00:00,615 --> 00:00:05,304
>>> NEARLY 250 YEARS AGO,
DELEGATES FROM THE 13 AMERICAN COLONIES

2
00:00:05,304 --> 00:00:08,651
GATHERED IN
PHILADELPHIA TO SIGN A
REVOLUTIONARY DOCUMENT

3
00:00:08,663 --> 00:00:11,228
DECLARING
THAT THEY WERE NO LONGER SUBJECTS

4
00:00:11,228 --> 00:00:13,470
BUT FREE TO CHOOSE
THEIR OWN DESTINY.

5
00:00:13,555 --> 00:00:17,625
THAT DOCUMENT WOULD COME TO BE
KNOWN AS THE DECLARATION OF
INDEPENDENCE.

6
00:00:17,625 --> 00:00:21,158
AND THOSE MEN, THE FOUNDING
FATHERS.

7
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:33,540
>> GENTLEMEN, THOSE OF US WHO
HAVE PUT OUR NAMES TO THIS DECLARATION

8
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:36,652
ARE NOW ENEMIES OF
THE CROWN.

9
00:00:36,652 --> 00:00:40,207
ESPECIALLY ME, JOHN HANCOCK,'

10
00:00:40,207 --> 00:00:43,642
CAUSE I WROTE MY NAME THE
BIGGEST.

11
00:00:43,642 --> 00:00:45,707
>> YEAH, WE SAW THAT.

12
00:00:45,707 --> 00:00:50,249
BUT WHAT YOU SAY IS TRUE.
WE MUST INDEED ALL HANG
TOGETHER.

13
00:00:50,249 --> 00:00:53,586
OR MOST ASSUREDLY, WE SHALL ALL
HANG SEPARATELY.

14
00:00:53,586 --> 00:00:58,091
>> WHAT SAY YOU, ALEXANDER
HAMILTON?

15
00:01:01,222 --> 00:01:03,937
>> WHAT DO I SAY?

16
00:01:06,855 --> 00:01:12,788
I SAY, OUR LIVES MATTER NOT IF
WE LOSE THEM IN THE CAUSE OF
LIBERTY.

17
00:01:12,881 --> 00:01:15,467
WHAT MATTERS IS THE NATION WE
BUILD.

18
00:01:15,467 --> 00:01:17,564
>> HEAR, HEAR!
>> AYE, AYE!

19
00:01:17,564 --> 00:01:20,842
>> BECAUSE IN AMERICA, ALL MEN
ARE CREATED EQUAL.

20
00:01:20,842 --> 00:01:23,636
¶ AMERICA NOT ENGLAND WE DOING
THE SEQUEL ¶

21
00:01:23,636 --> 00:01:26,490
¶ WE WILL HAVE LEADERS BUT

22
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:30,027
IN AMERICA WE WILL NEVER HAVE A
KING ¶

23
00:01:30,027 --> 00:01:32,439
>> NEVER SAY NEVER.

24
00:01:32,954 --> 00:01:35,802
OF COURSE, THOUGH IN MANY WAYS
I'M NOT.

25
00:01:35,802 --> 00:01:38,449
I'M IN MY KING ERA.

26
00:01:38,449 --> 00:01:43,260
BUT JUST LIKE THE FOUNDING
FATHERS, I AM CREATING A NEW
COUNTRY AS WELL.

27
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:47,050
AND JUST LIKE THEM, WE'RE DOING
IT VERY WHITELEY.

28
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:49,255
DEI IS OVER.
IT'S DEAD.

29
00:01:49,255 --> 00:01:53,307
WORKPLACES MUST GO BACK TO
LOOKING LIKE THE TV SHOW "THE
OFFICE."

30
00:01:53,307 --> 00:01:56,386
MOSTLY WHITE PEOPLE BUT WITH ONE
FUNNY BLACK GUY

31
00:01:56,386 --> 00:01:58,367
WHO'S HAVING A
REALLY BAD TIME.

32
00:01:58,367 --> 00:02:01,071
WE NEED TO BRING BACK STANLEY
CULTURE.

33
00:02:01,071 --> 00:02:05,400
IN TERMS OF CROSSWORD AND WITH
REGARD TO PRETZEL DAY.

34
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:08,829
LOOK AT LIN.
HE GOT TRICKED INTO COMING HERE,

35
00:02:08,829 --> 00:02:12,129
NOW HE'S FROZEN ON STAGE.

36
00:02:12,753 --> 00:02:15,089
BUT I'M BACK IN THE WHITE HOUSE.

37
00:02:15,089 --> 00:02:17,977
JUST IN TIME.
EVERYTHING IS BACK TO HOW IT
WAS.

38
00:02:17,977 --> 00:02:20,852
EXCEPT NOW MY NEW FAVORITE SON
IS BARRON.

39
00:02:20,852 --> 00:02:25,045
AND HE IS SMACKING HIS HEAD ON
EVERY DOOR FRAME, OH, IT'S BAD.

40
00:02:25,045 --> 00:02:28,138
IT'S LIKE WHEN GANDALF GOES TO
BILBO'S HOUSE.

41
00:02:28,138 --> 00:02:32,182
AND THE INAUGURATION WAS A
TREMENDOUS SUCCESS.

42
00:02:32,182 --> 00:02:35,359
IT WAS INSIDE DUE TO COLD AND
FEAR.

43
00:02:35,359 --> 00:02:37,847
BUT WE HAVE A LOT OF SURPRISE
GUESTS.

44
00:02:37,847 --> 00:02:40,629
LIKE MELANIA.
THAT WAS NICE.

45
00:02:40,629 --> 00:02:43,963
MELANIA SHOWED UP TO MY
INAUGURATION DRESSED LIKE

46
00:02:43,963 --> 00:02:47,882
KUNG LAO FROM "MORTAL KOMBAT."

47
00:02:47,882 --> 00:02:50,776
I HAD TO PUT MY NERD HERD IN THE
FRONT ROW,

48
00:02:50,776 --> 00:02:53,410
BROLIGARCHS BEFORE
OLIGARCHS.

49
00:02:53,411 --> 00:02:55,919
SAY

50
00:02:55,919 --> 00:03:00,658
ZUCK, TIM BEZOS, OF COURSE,
ELON.

51
00:03:00,658 --> 00:03:02,137
WE LOVE ELON,

52
00:03:02,137 --> 00:03:04,524
BUT TO QUOTE SOME OF HIS OWN CHILDREN,

53
00:03:04,524 --> 00:03:07,663
"I DO NOT WANT HIM IN MY LIFE."

54
00:03:07,663 --> 00:03:10,847
THEY SAY HE GAVE THE NAZI
SALUTE.
NOT TRUE.

55
00:03:10,847 --> 00:03:16,028
HE WAS CREATING A NEW GREETING.
A CROSS BETWEEN HI AND HELLO.

56
00:03:16,028 --> 00:03:18,975
WE'RE CALLED IT "HEIL."

57
00:03:19,387 --> 00:03:21,837
LIN, WHAT DO YOU THINK, DID HE
DO IT?

58
00:03:21,837 --> 00:03:24,569
I THINK HE DID IT A LITTLE BIT.

59
00:03:24,569 --> 00:03:27,382
BUT -- IT'S BEEN A GREAT FIRST
WEEK.

60
00:03:27,382 --> 00:03:29,147
I'VE DONE MORE IN THE PAST FOUR YEARS

61
00:03:29,147 --> 00:03:34,265
THAN SLEEPY JOE AND KAMALA
DID IN THE PAST FOUR YEARS.

62
00:03:34,265 --> 00:03:37,603
ALL THANKS TO MY BEAUTIFUL
EXECUTIVE ORDERS.

63
00:03:37,603 --> 00:03:40,387
FROM NOW ON, THERE WILL BE TWO
GENDERS.

64
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:42,449
ONE TO WORK, AND ONE TO COOK.

65
00:03:42,449 --> 00:03:47,489
AND WE'RE DONE WITH LGBT.
NO MORE DRAG, NO MORE GUYS IN WIGS, NO MORE --

66
00:03:47,489 --> 00:03:50,192
WHATEVER THESE
GUYS WERE WEARING.

67
00:03:50,192 --> 00:03:54,250
WHAT A WEIRD WAY TO DRESS,
RIGHT?
A LITTLE ZESTY.

68
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:57,300
DARLING, I'M OFF TO START
AMERICA!

69
00:03:57,300 --> 00:04:01,712
HAND ME MY WIG AND MY TIGHTS AND
MY BIG BLOUSY SHIRTS.

70
00:04:01,712 --> 00:04:04,825
SO WE'RE GOING TO GO BACK TO
COMMON SENSE IN REGARDS TO
GENDER.

71
00:04:04,825 --> 00:04:07,714
AND THE WOMEN WILL WEAR THE
MAKEUP.
NO MORE MAKEUP ON MEN.

72
00:04:07,812 --> 00:04:10,924
UNLESS YOU NEED IT TO BE
PRESIDENT.

73
00:04:10,924 --> 00:04:14,618
ALSO, WE ARE PULLING OUT OF
PARIS CLIMATE AGREEMENT,

74
00:04:14,618 --> 00:04:16,868
WE'RE
PULLING OUT OF WORLD HEALTH
ORGANIZATION,

75
00:04:16,898 --> 00:04:20,589
USING SOMETHING I
CALL THE PULLOUT METHOD.

76
00:04:20,589 --> 00:04:23,822
SOMETHING, FRANKLY, I WISH I DID
A LOT MORE IN THE 1980s.

77
00:04:23,822 --> 00:04:25,280
ERIC!

78
00:04:26,117 --> 00:04:29,266
BUT AS MUCH AS I'VE ALREADY
ACCOMPLISHED,

79
00:04:29,266 --> 00:04:31,193
THERE'S STILL SO
MUCH TO BE DONE.

80
00:04:31,193 --> 00:04:35,171
I KNOW I SAID I WOULD END THE
WAR IN UKRAINE IN 24 HOURS.

81
00:04:35,171 --> 00:04:38,181
I DIDN'T SAY WHICH 24 HOURS.

82
00:04:38,181 --> 00:04:42,506
ALSO HAVE TO ENSURE THAT ALL OF
MY CABINET POSITIONS ARE FILLED.

83
00:04:42,506 --> 00:04:45,205
WE'RE FILLING MY CABINET WITH
SOME OF THE BEST PEOPLE.

84
00:04:45,205 --> 00:04:48,641
THEY'RE ALL VERY GOOD.
EXCEPT FOR MOST OF THEM.

85
00:04:48,641 --> 00:04:51,760
OH, MAN, WHAT IS "SNL" GOING TO
DO?
WHO'S GOING TO PLAY HEGSETH?

86
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:57,429
LOOK AT THESE GUYS BACK HERE.
NONE OF THEM GOT THE BUILD.
NOBODY HAS THE JAW.

87
00:04:57,429 --> 00:05:01,508
GOT PLENTY OF ZUCKERBERG
OPTIONS, THOSE.
THAT'S GOING TO BE A FIGHT.

88
00:05:01,857 --> 00:05:06,245
OH, HOW GREAT IS PETE HEGSETH?
HE SAID HE WAS GOING TO STOP
DRINKING IF HE GOT THE JOB,

89
00:05:06,245 --> 00:05:07,702
AND
THAT'S ALL I NEEDED TO HEAR.

90
00:05:07,702 --> 00:05:12,565
I'LL NEVER DRINK AGAIN!
THE FAMOUS PROMISE PEOPLE MAKE
RIGHT INTO THE TOILET.

91
00:05:12,565 --> 00:05:14,630
GOOD LUCK WITH THAT.

92
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:18,874
OH, LOOK AT LIN, LOOK HOW BAD HE
WANTS TO DO A RAP.

93
00:05:19,028 --> 00:05:21,987
HE WROTE A WHOLE RAP, AND HE
DOESN'T GET TO DO IT.

94
00:05:21,987 --> 00:05:24,082
THE AUDIENCE WOULD HAVE EATEN
THAT RIGHT UP.

95
00:05:24,082 --> 00:05:26,663
BUT WE'RE NOT GOING TO HEAR IT.

96
00:05:26,663 --> 00:05:29,375
HE'S IN SNIFFING DISTANCE OF AN EGOT,

97
00:05:29,375 --> 00:05:31,977
AND HE'S GOT TO STAND
THERE TILL I'M DONE.

98
00:05:31,977 --> 00:05:35,801
LINDIE, LINDIE, LINDIE, LINDIE.

99
00:05:35,801 --> 00:05:38,028
LAURA LINNEY.

100
00:05:38,028 --> 00:05:42,474
LIN-MANUEL MIRANDA COSGROVE.
THERE HE IS.

101
00:05:42,474 --> 00:05:45,030
HE'S SUCH A MOR RAN.

102
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:48,620
WELL, IN CONCLUSION, IT'S BEEN A
GREAT WEEK.

103
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:50,634
I BASICALLY HIT ALL MY CAMPAIGN
PROMISES

104
00:05:50,634 --> 00:05:53,966
EXCEPT FOR THE ONE
PEOPLE CARED ABOUT, PRICE OF
EGGS.

105
00:05:53,966 --> 00:05:55,286
ALL-TIME HIGH.

106
00:05:55,286 --> 00:05:58,447
WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT IT WOULD
BE EASIER TO GET A CEASE FIR IN GAZA

107
00:05:58,447 --> 00:06:00,679
THAN BRING DOWN THE PRICE
OF EGGS?

108
00:06:00,679 --> 00:06:02,980
MIGHT HAVE TO TAKE THE "L" ON
THAT ONE.

109
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:06,748
WE'RE LOOKING INTO FABULOUS
ALTERNATIVE EGG OPTIONS

110
00:06:06,748 --> 00:06:10,951
SUCH AS
SEAGULL OR PERHAPS CADBURY.

111
00:06:11,245 --> 00:06:13,986
WELL, LIN, YOU'VE BEEN A GREAT
SPORT.

112
00:06:13,986 --> 00:06:16,538
FRANKLY, A REALLY GOOD FRIEND.

113
00:06:16,538 --> 00:06:21,646
I WANT TO THANK HIM FOR HIS
GENEROUS ANONYMOUS $1 MILLION
DONATION TO MY CAMPAIGN.

114
00:06:21,646 --> 00:06:23,368
I KNOW THAT WAS YOU, LIN.

115
00:06:23,368 --> 00:06:26,080
>> NO, IT WAS NOT.
>> YOUR WORD AGAINST MINE!

116
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:30,167
AND LIVE FROM NEW YORK, IT'S
SATURDAY NIGHT!

117
00:08:48,237 --> 00:08:53,339
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN -- TIMOTHEE
CHALAMET!

118
00:09:13,143 --> 00:09:16,423
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING
HERE.

119
00:09:16,423 --> 00:09:21,020
I'M HONORED TO BE BACK.
THIS IS MY THIRD TIME HOSTING
SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE.

120
00:09:22,953 --> 00:09:26,238
BUT IT'S MY FIRST TIME
HOSTING IT WITH A LITTLE STACHE
AND A LITTLE GOATEE.

121
00:09:26,238 --> 00:09:29,357
LET'S GET A LITTLE CLOSEUP ON
THAT, ALL RIGHT?

122
00:09:29,357 --> 00:09:34,137
YEAH, GET CLOSE, YEAH.
THAT'S 37 HAIRS RIGHT THERE.
YEAH, I COUNTED.

123
00:09:34,137 --> 00:09:36,921
I'M LITERALLY GOING TO BE 30
YEARS OLD NEXT YEAR.
OKAY.

124
00:09:36,921 --> 00:09:39,296
BUT SERIOUSLY, THIS IS A
HISTORIC EPISODE

125
00:09:39,296 --> 00:09:44,340
BECAUSE IT'S
THE FIRST TIME AN ACTOR HAS ALSO
BEEN THE MUSICAL GUEST AT
SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE.

126
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:48,006
IF YOU'RE WONDERING IF THAT'S
TRUE, IT'S NOT.

127
00:09:48,236 --> 00:09:53,020
THAT'S A DISTINCTION I SHARE
WITH THE GREAT GARY BUSEY.

128
00:09:54,878 --> 00:09:59,083
TONIGHT, I'LL BE PLAYING SONGS
BY BOB DYLAN, AND I WILL SAY --

129
00:09:59,083 --> 00:10:00,605
THANK YOU.

130
00:10:02,374 --> 00:10:05,179
I WILL SAY, IT WAS A LITTLE
WEIRD PLAYING BOB DYLAN

131
00:10:05,179 --> 00:10:06,640
RIGHT
AFTER I PLAYED WILLY WONKA.

132
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:10,855
BUT I ACTUALLY DISCOVERED THAT
THE TWO MEN HAVE A LOT IN
COMMON.

133
00:10:10,855 --> 00:10:14,042
THEY'RE BOTH ECCENTRIC.
THEY'RE BOTH INNOVATORS.

134
00:10:14,042 --> 00:10:18,359
AND THEY BOTH CAPTURED AND
ENSLAVED HUNDREDS OF OOMPA
LOOMPAS.

135
00:10:21,076 --> 00:10:25,834
A COMPLETE UNKNOWN JUST GOT
EIGHT ACADEMY AWARD NOMINATIONS.

136
00:10:25,834 --> 00:10:28,797
THANK YOU.

137
00:10:28,797 --> 00:10:31,148
AND I'M TRULY OVERJOYED.

138
00:10:31,148 --> 00:10:36,052
I WAS LITERALLY CRYING IN MY
DRESSING ROOM WHEN I FOUND OUT
THE ENTIRE CREATIVE TEAM

139
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:39,386
WORKED
EXTREMELY HARD BRINGING TO LIFE
THE BRILLIANT ARTIST, BOB DYLAN,

140
00:10:39,386 --> 00:10:43,119
A MAN WHOSE MUSIC AND CAREER HAS
BECOME A GUIDING LIGHT TO ME.

141
00:10:43,119 --> 00:10:45,862
IT'S AN ENORMOUS HONOR GOING TO
THESE AWARD SHOWS.

142
00:10:45,862 --> 00:10:47,547
IT'S SUCH A GREAT EXPERIENCE.

143
00:10:47,547 --> 00:10:51,173
BUT I JUST KEEP LOSING.

144
00:10:52,551 --> 00:10:56,499
AND EACH TIME, IT GETS HARDER TO
PRETEND IT DOESN'T STING.

145
00:10:56,499 --> 00:10:58,578
LET'S TAKE A LOOK.

146
00:10:58,578 --> 00:11:02,430
>> AND THE WINNER IS -- GARY
OLDMAN.

313
00:17:12,332 --> 00:17:13,097
FORGET, GIRL.

314
00:17:13,099 --> 00:17:14,198
>> NATHANIEL!

315
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,299
>> YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.

316
00:17:15,301 --> 00:17:18,836
WE HAVE A CINNABON NEW FROSTED

317
00:17:18,838 --> 00:17:20,905
MEGA CINNA CAKE.

318
00:17:20,907 --> 00:17:22,240
THIS IS LIKE HEAVEN.

319
00:17:22,242 --> 00:17:22,540
FOCUS.

320
00:17:22,542 --> 00:17:24,976
FLY TO ME AND GRAB A BITE TO THE

321
00:17:24,978 --> 00:17:25,276
MUSIC.

322
00:17:25,278 --> 00:17:26,210
HERE WE GO.

323
00:17:26,212 --> 00:17:27,278
YES, FLY.

324
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,180
YES, YES, YES, LADIES!

325
00:17:29,182 --> 00:17:31,516
YES, YES, GET IN THERE, YES!

326
00:17:31,518 --> 00:17:34,819
YES, YES, GET IN THERE, YES!

327
00:17:34,821 --> 00:17:36,621
YES, EAT IT, EAT IT!

328
00:17:36,623 --> 00:17:38,189
EAT IT, GREAT, GREAT.

329
00:17:38,191 --> 00:17:39,323
GREAT, DELICIOUS.

330
00:17:39,325 --> 00:17:41,859
OKAY.

331
00:17:41,861 --> 00:17:42,660
>> WHAT IS THIS CLASS?

332
00:17:45,732 --> 00:17:48,533
YOU JUST BOUNCE AROUND AND EAT

333
00:17:48,535 --> 00:17:48,733
CINNABON?

334
00:17:48,867 --> 00:17:51,736
>> OH, SORRY WE'RE NOT

335
00:17:51,738 --> 00:17:54,472
WEIGHTLESS LIKE YOU, JASON

336
00:17:54,474 --> 00:17:55,740
MOMOA.

337
00:17:56,142 --> 00:17:57,308
>> IS THE CALORIE METER TOO BAD?

338
00:17:57,310 --> 00:17:57,708
>> YEP, YEP.

339
00:18:00,046 --> 00:18:00,878
>> THOSE THREE BITES WERE 1,100

340
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,747
CALORIES?

341
00:18:02,749 --> 00:18:04,015
>> OKAY, IT'S TIME TO WORK IT

342
00:18:04,017 --> 00:18:04,415
OFF, Y'ALL.

343
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:05,383
NOW FLY!

344
00:18:05,385 --> 00:18:06,651
FLY!

345
00:18:09,518 --> 00:18:12,460
>>> AT ONE MEDICAL, OUR MOTTO IS
HEALTH CARE FOR ALL.

346
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:16,765
ONE GROUP WAS BEING LEFT BEHIND.
MEN AGED 20 TO 45.

347
00:18:16,765 --> 00:18:19,120
COMPARED TO WOMEN, THEY'RE LESS
LIKELY TO SEE A DOCTOR

348
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:23,324
AND MORE
LIKELY TO SEEK MEDICAL ADVICE
FROM SOCIAL MEDIA OR PODCASTS.

349
00:18:23,324 --> 00:18:26,192
WE KNEW WE HAD TO DO BETTER IN
ORDER TO REACH THESE MEN.

350
00:18:26,192 --> 00:18:28,392
THAT'S WHY WE DEVELOPED MEDCAST.

351
00:18:28,392 --> 00:18:31,180
THE DOCTOR'S APPOINTMENT THAT
FEELS LIKE A PODCAST.

352
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:33,403
>> HEY!
>> WHAT UP?

353
00:18:33,404 --> 00:18:36,789
>> OUR GUEST TODAY IS KEVIN
JONES.
>> I LOVE HIM!

354
00:18:36,789 --> 00:18:39,561
>> WELCOME TO THE STUDIO, BRO.
>> THANKS FOR HAVING ME.

355
00:18:39,561 --> 00:18:42,045
>> AGAIN, MEDCAST IS NOT A
PODCAST.

356
00:18:42,045 --> 00:18:45,224
IT'S A REAL DOCTOR'S APPOINTMENT
THAT FEELS LIKE ONE,

357
00:18:45,224 --> 00:18:48,911
ALLOWING
MEN TO BE HONEST IN A WAY THEY
NEVER WOULD WITH A NORMAL
DOCTOR.

358
00:18:48,911 --> 00:18:51,477
>> HOW'S YOUR STOOLS?

359
00:18:51,477 --> 00:18:53,548
ANY BLOOD IN THOSE THINGS?

360
00:18:53,548 --> 00:18:55,893
SICK

361
00:18:55,893 --> 00:18:57,691
>> I USED TO HATE GOING TO THE
DOCTOR.

362
00:18:57,691 --> 00:19:01,215
MEDCAST ISN'T LIKE THAT.
WE JUST VIBE.

363
00:19:01,215 --> 00:19:05,549
>> MAN, YOU STILL PARTY, RIGHT?
I KNOW YOU PARTY, RIGHT?

364
00:19:05,549 --> 00:19:07,243
>> I'LL HAVE A COUPLE DRINKS
HERE AND THERE.

365
00:19:07,243 --> 00:19:09,019
>> OKAY!
>> HELL, YEAH.

366
00:19:09,019 --> 00:19:11,479
HOW MANY WOULD YOU SAY YOU HAVE
IN A WEEK?

367
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:15,426
>> MEDCAST CREATES A SUPPORTIVE,
LIGHTHEARTED ENVIRONMENT

368
00:19:15,426 --> 00:19:19,194
THAT
PUTS MEN AT EASE AND ALLOWS
DOCTORS TO DO THEIR IMPORTANT
WORK.

369
00:19:19,194 --> 00:19:21,611
>> OKAY.
HE'S LOW-KEY JACK, RIGHT?

370
00:19:21,611 --> 00:19:23,981
>> SHUT UP, NO, I'M NOT.

371
00:19:23,981 --> 00:19:27,430
>> GET OUT THE BICEP MEASURING
MACHINE.

372
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:30,721
>> 136 OVER 91!

373
00:19:32,577 --> 00:19:35,348
>> THAT'S NOT GOOD.
>> IT'S NOT?

374
00:19:35,348 --> 00:19:37,785
>> PLUS, DURING UNCOMFORTABLE
PARTS OF AN EXAM,

375
00:19:37,785 --> 00:19:42,364
OUR POD
DOCTORS ARE TRAINED TO ENGAGE
PATIENTS ON WHATEVER TOPIC
INTERESTS THEM.

376
00:19:42,364 --> 00:19:44,614
>> IT'S CALLED THE STONE APE
THEORY.
- WHAT?

377
00:19:44,614 --> 00:19:47,055
THEY THINK APES TOOK SHROOMS,

378
00:19:47,055 --> 00:19:49,557
AND THAT KICK-STARTED HUMAN
EVOLUTION.

379
00:19:49,557 --> 00:19:50,971
>> THAT'S CRAZY!

380
00:19:50,971 --> 00:19:53,175
GO AHEAD AND COUGH FOR ME.

381
00:19:53,586 --> 00:19:55,849
ORDER IMAGING FOR HERNIA.

382
00:19:55,849 --> 00:20:00,958
>> BEST OF ALL, WITH MEDCAST,
MEN ARE 80% MORE LIKELY TO
RETURN FOR FOLLOW-UPS.

383
00:20:00,958 --> 00:20:03,485
>> BEFORE YOU GO, TO WRAP UP,

384
00:20:03,485 --> 00:20:07,223
JUST SAY HOW MANY SEXUAL
PARTNERS WE'VE HAD IN THE LAST
12 MONTHS.

385
00:20:07,223 --> 00:20:08,973
>> OH, MAN.

386
00:20:08,973 --> 00:20:11,180
ZERO.

387
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:15,064
>> WE'VE GOT TO HAVE YOU BACK
ON, WHAT DO YOU SAY, IN SIX
MONTHS?

388
00:20:15,064 --> 00:20:16,096
>> YEAH, IF YOU'LL HAVE ME.

389
00:20:16,096 --> 00:20:17,721
>> "MEDCAST."

390
00:20:17,721 --> 00:20:19,817
>> MEDCAST FROM ONE MEDICAL.

391
00:20:19,817 --> 00:20:24,589
ONLY THING I SHOULD MENTION IS
WE DO POST THE EPISODES,

392
00:20:24,927 --> 00:20:27,501
AUDIO AND VIDEO.

393
00:20:27,501 --> 00:20:30,999
FINANCIALLY, IT'S THE ONLY WAY
WE COULD MAKE THIS WORK.

394
00:20:59,982 --> 00:21:04,695
WE ARE NEARLY DONE WITH BARISTA
TRAINING.

395
00:21:04,695 --> 00:21:09,574
>> NOW, CAN ANYONE TELL ME THE
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A LATTE AND A
CAPPUCCINO?

396
00:21:09,574 --> 00:21:14,479
>> A CAPPUCCINO HAS THE
MOZZARELLA ON THE BOTTOM AND THE
SAUCE ON TOP.

397
00:21:14,479 --> 00:21:18,526
>> NO, THAT'S DETROIT STYLE, AND
IT'S JUST FOR PIZZA.

398
00:21:18,526 --> 00:21:21,761
>> I DON'T THINK I CAN RECOVER
FROM THAT ONE.

399
00:21:21,761 --> 00:21:24,072
GOOD-BYE, EVERYBODY.

400
00:21:26,116 --> 00:21:29,787
>> OKAY.
THAT'S PROBABLY FOR THE BEST.

401
00:21:29,787 --> 00:21:32,430
OKAY, WELL, A FUN PART OF
WORKING AT THIS CAFE

402
00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:36,123
IS WRITING
QUIPPY JOKES FOR OUR CHALKBOARD
OUT FRONT.

403
00:21:36,123 --> 00:21:38,594
>> PEOPLE GO CRAZY FOR OUR PUNS.

404
00:21:38,594 --> 00:21:43,452
>> WHOA, WAIT, WE GET TO DO
JOKES?
I LOVE COMEDY.

405
00:21:43,452 --> 00:21:46,811
>> OH, THAT'S GREAT, BENNY,
YOU'LL BE REALLY GOOD AT THIS.

406
00:21:46,811 --> 00:21:50,012
>> YEAH.
I BET I WILL BE.

407
00:21:50,012 --> 00:21:55,516
>> OKAY.
SO, OUR SIGNS USUALLY HAVE A
COFFEE PUN.

408
00:21:55,516 --> 00:21:59,015
SO, MAYBE WE DO SOMETHING WITH
THE COLD WEATHER?

409
00:21:59,015 --> 00:22:03,563
>> YEAH, LIKE, IT'S ESPRESS-SO
COLD OUTSIDE.

410
00:22:03,564 --> 00:22:05,021
TRY

411
00:22:05,021 --> 00:22:10,434
>> IT'S SO COLD OUT, I CAN'T
COMPANY.
OF-FEEL MY FACE.

412
00:22:10,434 --> 00:22:13,648
>> OH, YEAH.
>> CASSIE?

413
00:22:13,648 --> 00:22:18,852
>> OH, MAYBE, THIS COLD WEATHER
IS MOCHA ME CRAZY.

414
00:22:20,776 --> 00:22:22,991
>> OKAY, THERE ARE NO BAD IDEAS.

415
00:22:22,991 --> 00:22:26,449
BENNY?
>> LET ME THINK.

416
00:22:26,898 --> 00:22:31,105
MAN, YOU EVER GO TO YOUR
LADY, SAY SHE GOT A YELLOW RING
AROUND THE TUB?

417
00:22:31,105 --> 00:22:35,717
GIRL, WHO YOU BEEN WASHING UP IN
THERE, HOMER SIMPSON?

418
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:43,582
>> I'M SORRY, THAT WAS FOR THE
CHALKBOARD?

419
00:22:43,582 --> 00:22:45,548
>> YEAH, WE'RE DOING JOKES,
RIGHT?

420
00:22:45,548 --> 00:22:49,707
>> YEAH.
OKAY.
COUPLE THINGS.

421
00:22:49,707 --> 00:22:51,988
YOU DIDN'T MENTION COFFEE.

422
00:22:51,988 --> 00:22:54,710
>> ALSO, YOU DID A CHRIS
ROCK-STYLE PACE.

423
00:22:54,710 --> 00:22:57,249
THAT'S KIND OF DIFFICULT TO
CONVEY ON A SIGN.

424
00:22:57,249 --> 00:23:00,402
>> YEAH, AND WHO WERE YOU
LOOKING AT?

425
00:23:00,402 --> 00:23:04,632
>> OKAY, SO LET'S TRY AGAIN.
NOT EVERYONE GETS THE VOICE
RIGHT AWAY.
TOM?

426
00:23:04,632 --> 00:23:07,611
>> OKAY.
HOW ABOUT, WASN'T IT COLD
YESTERDAY?

427
00:23:07,611 --> 00:23:09,902
I'M HAVING DEJA BREW.

428
00:23:09,902 --> 00:23:13,143
>> AMAZING.
CASSIE?

429
00:23:13,143 --> 00:23:17,959
>> HOW ABOUT, OUR BRR-ISTAS WILL
WARM YOU RIGHT UP.

430
00:23:19,495 --> 00:23:22,163
>> HEY, YOU'RE TRYING, AND I
RESPECT THAT.

431
00:23:22,163 --> 00:23:25,769
BENNY?
>> UM, OKAY, LET ME SEE.

432
00:23:26,133 --> 00:23:29,232
YOU EVER GET READY TO GO TO
CHEESECAKE FACTORY WITH YOUR LADY

433
00:23:29,232 --> 00:23:32,236
AND SHE GOES, I DON'T WANT
TO EAT TOO MUCH, I DON'T WANT TO
GET BIG.

434
00:23:32,236 --> 00:23:35,774
GIRL, TOO LATE!
BIG BENNY SAY WHAT?

435
00:23:40,668 --> 00:23:46,624
>> OKAY.
A LOT TO TALK ABOUT HERE.

436
00:23:46,624 --> 00:23:49,914
YOU DID A FULL DANCE BREAK AND
ADDED A CATCH PHRASE.

437
00:23:49,914 --> 00:23:52,164
ALSO, HOW DID YOU CONNECT TO THE
BLUETOOTH?

438
00:23:52,164 --> 00:23:55,221
>> AND AGAIN, ZERO MENTION OF
COFFEE.

439
00:23:55,221 --> 00:23:57,119
>> NO, THAT'S BECAUSE I WASN'T
DONE YET.

440
00:23:57,119 --> 00:24:00,684
COME TO 250 MADISON AVENUE FOR
SOME HOT-ASS COFFEE!

441
00:24:01,138 --> 00:24:03,535
>> NO, NO, NO.

442
00:24:03,535 --> 00:24:06,435
YOU DON'T NEED THE ADDRESS IF
SOMEONE'S READING THE SIGN.

443
00:24:06,435 --> 00:24:07,682
THEY'RE ALREADY HERE.

444
00:24:07,682 --> 00:24:11,399
>> YEAH, ALSO, I DON'T WANT WE
WANT TO BE CALLING WOMEN FAT.

445
00:24:11,399 --> 00:24:13,994
>> HEY, AIN'T NOTHING WRONG WITH
A BIG OLD WOMAN.

446
00:24:13,994 --> 00:24:16,632
HEY, YOU SHOULD PUT THAT ON THE
SIGN.

447
00:24:17,610 --> 00:24:21,161
>> YOU THINK THE SIGN IN FRONT
OF OUR COFFEE SHOP SHOULD SAY

448
00:24:21,161 --> 00:24:23,479
"NOTHING WRONG WITH A BIG"
WOMAN"?

449
00:24:23,479 --> 00:24:26,170
>> YES, SIR, I DO.

450
00:24:26,170 --> 00:24:27,738
LIKE MY MAN OVER HERE.

451
00:24:27,738 --> 00:24:30,256
HEY.
CAN I ASK YOU?
HEY, HOW BIG IS YOUR WIFE?

452
00:24:30,256 --> 00:24:32,334
>> SORRY, I'M JUST TRYING TO
ORDER.

453
00:24:32,334 --> 00:24:34,885
SHE'S DECENTLY LARGE, THOUGH.

454
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:41,702
>> OKAY, BENNY, PLEASE DON'T DO
CROWD WORK WITH THE CUSTOMERS.

455
00:24:41,702 --> 00:24:44,089
>> YEAH.
LET'S JUST MAKE IT SIMPLE.

456
00:24:44,089 --> 00:24:47,009
JUST A PUN ON THE WORD "LATTE."
TOM?

457
00:24:47,009 --> 00:24:51,221
>> HOW ABOUT LA-TAKE YOURSELF
OUT OF THE COLD AND HAVE SOME
COFFEE?

458
00:24:51,221 --> 00:24:53,246
>> FANTASTIC.

459
00:24:53,246 --> 00:24:54,857
CASSIE?

460
00:24:54,857 --> 00:24:58,980
>> OOH-LA-LATTE, IT'S COLD OUT.

461
00:24:59,789 --> 00:25:02,836
>> IS EVERYTHING OKAY AT HOME?

462
00:25:02,836 --> 00:25:06,932
>> THESE AREN'T BAD IDEAS.
>> THEY ARE.

463
00:25:06,932 --> 00:25:11,278
BENNY.
AND REMEMBER, JUST A PUN ON THE
WORD "LATTE."

464
00:25:11,278 --> 00:25:13,731
>> OKAY, ALL RIGHT, LET ME
THINK.

465
00:25:13,731 --> 00:25:17,812
UM -- MAN, JUST THE OTHER DAY MY
LADY SAID, BIG BENNY, HOW MUCH
WEIGHT YOU THINK I GAINED?

466
00:25:17,812 --> 00:25:21,033
GIRL, A LATTE!

00:25:25,923 --> 00:25:27,191
BUT I AIN'T MAD.

ALL RIGHT, Y'ALL, THAT'S MY
TIME, GIVE IT UP FOR YOUR NEXT COMIC,

YO REGGIE, I WANT YOU TO GO
DOWNTOWN.

471
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:44,421
AND I LIKE, GIRL, NOT UNTIL YOU
CLEAN UP THEM STREETS.

472
00:25:44,421 --> 00:25:46,159
GIMME SOME!

473
00:25:51,987 --> 00:25:54,634
>> WHAT ELSE IS IN THE NEWS?

474
00:25:54,835 --> 00:25:58,740
>> WOW.
I THINK I SPEAK FOR BOTH OF US

475
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:00,471
WHEN I SAY THIS.

476
00:26:00,471 --> 00:26:02,500
THE CAFE IS YOURS NOW.

477
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:03,678
THAT WAS FANTASTIC!

478
00:26:03,678 --> 00:26:07,930
>> BIG BENNY'S CAFE.
NOTHING WRONG WITH A BIG OLD
WOMAN AND A HOT-ASS CUP OF
COFFEE.

479
00:26:07,930 --> 00:26:09,758
GIMME SOME!

480
00:26:12,126 --> 00:26:14,833
>>> VALENTINE'S DAY IS RIGHT
AROUND THE CORNER.

481
00:26:14,833 --> 00:26:18,389
WITH SO MANY GIFTS AND SO MANY
WAYS TO SAY I LOVE YOU.

482
00:26:18,389 --> 00:26:20,897
AND SURE, YOU HAVE A GIRLFRIEND.

483
00:26:20,984 --> 00:26:25,452
BUT THERE'S NO WOMAN IN YOUR
LIFE MORE SPECIAL THAN YOUR MOM.

484
00:26:25,452 --> 00:26:27,652
BECAUSE YOU LOVE YOUR MOM.

485
00:26:27,652 --> 00:26:29,679
YOU REALLY LOVE HER.

486
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:32,648
THE WAY YOUR DAD NEVER COULD.

487
00:26:32,648 --> 00:26:37,763
SO THIS YEAR, WHY NOT GET YOUR
MOM AN OEDIPAL ARRANGEMENT.

488
00:26:37,763 --> 00:26:40,328
BASED ON THE TRAGIC GREEK MYTH OF OEDIPUS,

489
00:26:40,328 --> 00:26:42,815
WHO MURDERED HIS
FATHER AND MARRIED HIS MOTHER.

490
00:26:42,815 --> 00:26:45,389
OEDIPAL ARRANGEMENTS LET YOUR MOTHER KNOW,

491
00:26:45,389 --> 00:26:48,913
SHE'S MORE THAN
JUST YOUR MOM, SHE'S YOUR
EVERYTHING.

492
00:26:48,913 --> 00:26:53,099
FEATURING JUICY, SUCCULENT
FRUIT.

493
00:26:53,099 --> 00:26:57,086
THE KIND YOU CAN HAND-FEED
DIRECTLY TO YOUR MOM.

494
00:26:57,086 --> 00:27:01,272
WHILE YOUR DAD CAN ONLY STAND
THERE, WATCHING.

495
00:27:01,573 --> 00:27:05,965
OEDIPAL ARRANGEMENTS FEATURE
RICH CHOCOLATE THAT'S MELTED

496
00:27:05,965 --> 00:27:09,178
ALONG WITH ANY BOUNDARIES.

497
00:27:09,178 --> 00:27:12,076
>> SHOULD WE MAYBE PLAY A BOARD
GAME OR SOMETHING?

498
00:27:12,076 --> 00:27:13,864
>> HOW ABOUT TABOO?

499
00:27:14,005 --> 00:27:15,753
>> I FEEL LIKE WE'RE PLAYING
ALREADY.

500
00:27:15,753 --> 00:27:18,117
>> THEY CALL IT AN OEDIPAL COMPLEX,

501
00:27:18,117 --> 00:27:21,530
BUT WHEN YOU'RE
TOGETHER, THERE'S NOTHING
COMPLEX ABOUT IT.

502
00:27:21,530 --> 00:27:24,158
>> YOU TWO OKAY OVER THERE?

503

00:27:43,648 --> 00:27:46,714
>> YOU CAN'T USE OUR BEDROOM!
HEY!

507
00:27:46,714 --> 00:27:49,451
YOU'RE NOT TOO OLD FOR A
SPANKING, MISTER.

00:27:49,451 --> 00:27:52,927
>> OH, TRUST ME.
I'LL GET ONE.

512
00:28:15,061 --> 00:28:16,927

>> I CAN SEE FROM HERE THAT

516
00:28:20,066 --> 00:28:22,032
YOU'RE PLAYING THE iPHONE GAME

517
00:28:22,034 --> 00:28:24,268
WHERE THAT DASTARDLY KING IS

518
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:26,036
TRAPPED AND YOU HAVE TO PLAY

519
00:28:26,038 --> 00:28:29,807
CANDY CRUSH TO FREE HIM.

520
00:28:29,809 --> 00:28:31,308
>> PSHHT.

521
00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:32,976
>> OKAY, NOW I KNOW THAT MANY OF

522
00:28:32,978 --> 00:28:35,913
YOU ARE STRUGGLING WITH READING,

523
00:28:35,915 --> 00:28:37,281
STUDYING, AND LEARNING.

524
00:28:37,283 --> 00:28:39,383
IF YOUR GRADES DON'T IMPROVE,

525
00:28:39,385 --> 00:28:41,218
THEY'RE GOING TO TURN OUR SCHOOL

526
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:42,986
EITHER INTO A TARGET OR A

527
00:28:42,988 --> 00:28:43,520
FOR-PROFIT JAIL.

528
00:28:43,522 --> 00:28:44,455
>> I VOTE TARGET.

529
00:28:44,457 --> 00:28:47,257
>> NO, WE DON'T GET TO CHOOSE.

530
00:28:47,259 --> 00:28:49,059
SO THE SCHOOL HAS INVESTED IN A

531
00:28:49,061 --> 00:28:51,161
NEW AI PROGRAM THAT TAKES YOUR

532
00:28:51,163 --> 00:28:52,996
TEXTBOOKS AND TURNS THEM INTO AN

533
00:28:52,998 --> 00:28:53,864
EDUCATIONAL PODCAST.

534
00:28:53,866 --> 00:28:56,467
>> WHOA, AI CAN MAKE A PODCAST?

535
00:28:56,469 --> 00:28:58,635
I'VE ONLY EVER USED IT TO MAKE

536
00:28:58,637 --> 00:28:59,770
PEOPLE DO FUNNY DANCES.

IT'S FREAKY.

540
00:29:03,776 --> 00:29:05,542
>> THE TECHNOLOGY ISN'T PERFECT,

541
00:29:05,544 --> 00:29:07,044
BUT THEY MAKE IT SOUND SO CASUAL

542
00:29:07,046 --> 00:29:09,012
THAT IT DOESN'T EVEN FEEL LIKE

543
00:29:09,014 --> 00:29:09,480
HOMEWORK.

544
00:29:09,482 --> 00:29:09,780

MUCH EASIER TO UNDERSTAND.

580
00:30:00,432 --> 00:30:03,167
LET'S TRY A SCIENCE ONE.

581
00:30:03,169 --> 00:30:05,135

NOT, LIKE, BURGERS?

587

00:38:55,164 --> 00:38:58,621
WELL, GUYS.
I WAS NEVER REALLY DOING DRY
JANUARY,

798
00:38:58,621 --> 00:39:01,088
BUT THIS WEEK I STOPPED
EVEN PRETENDING.

799
00:39:01,088 --> 00:39:04,583
PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS SWORN BACK
INTO OFFICE ON MONDAY.

800
00:39:04,583 --> 00:39:08,019
BUT HE APPEARED TO NOT PLACE HIS
HAND ON THE BIBLE.

801
00:39:08,019 --> 00:39:11,461
WELL, HE TRIED TO, BUT THE BIBLE
SCREAMED.

802
00:39:11,461 --> 00:39:16,338
THE BIBLE TRUMP USED WAS THE
SAME ONE ABRAHAM LINCOLN USED AT
HIS INAUGURATION,

803
00:39:16,338 --> 00:39:18,891
AND MAN, I
WISH THOSE TWO COULD TALK TO
EACH OTHER.

804
00:39:18,891 --> 00:39:23,024
LINCOLN COULD TEACH TRUMP A LOT
ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF
PRESERVING OUR UNION.

805
00:39:23,024 --> 00:39:28,217
TRUMP COULD TEACH LINCOLN HOW TO
TURN YOUR HEAD AT THE EXACT
RIGHT MOMENT.

806
00:39:33,354 --> 00:39:36,744
DURING HIS ADDRESS, PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID

807
00:39:36,744 --> 00:39:41,663
HE WAS CHANGING THE
NAME OF THE GULF OF MEXICO TO
THE GULF OF AMERICA.

808
00:39:43,072 --> 00:39:48,242
AND -- LIKE YOU, HILLARY CLINTON
COULD BE SEEN IN THE BACKGROUND
LAUGHING WHILE HE SAID IT.

809
00:39:48,242 --> 00:39:53,479
WHILE KAMALA COULD BE SEEN
SILENTLY BEGGING HER EDIBLE TO
KICK IN.

810
00:39:54,564 --> 00:39:59,436
>>> PRESIDENT TRUMP PARDONED
OATH KEEPERS LEADER STEWART RHODES,

811
00:39:59,436 --> 00:40:03,205
WHO WAS SERVING 18 YEARS
FOR HIS ROLE IN THE JANUARY 6th
ATTACKS.

812
00:40:03,205 --> 00:40:07,378
AND LADIES, JUST LIKE HIS EYES,
HE'S SINGLE.

813
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:14,614
>>> PRESIDENT TRUMP DEFENDED HIS
PARDON OF THE JANUARY 6th ATTACKERS,

814
00:40:14,614 --> 00:40:17,746
SAYING THAT THESE ARE
JUST PEOPLE THAT LOVE THEIR
COUNTRY.

815
00:40:17,746 --> 00:40:21,033
YOU KNOW.
LIKE HOW O.J. LOVED NICOLE.

816
00:40:22,685 --> 00:40:25,114
IT'S A DARK "UPDATE."

817
00:40:25,629 --> 00:40:29,015
>>> PRESIDENT TRUMP REVEALED
WHAT HE CALLED AN INSPIRATIONAL LETTER

818
00:40:29,015 --> 00:40:31,562
THAT PRESIDENT BIDEN LEFT
HIM IN THE OVAL OFFICE,

819
00:40:31,562 --> 00:40:34,589
WHICH
READ, "ENJOY IT, DO A GOOD JOB."

820
00:40:34,589 --> 00:40:37,313
THOUGH TRUMP THOUGHT IT WAS
STRANGE THAT THE LETTER BEGAN,

821
00:40:37,313 --> 00:40:41,118
"CONGRATS ON BEING THE FIRST"
BLACK FEMALE PRESIDENT."

822
00:40:44,646 --> 00:40:47,523
>>> THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION
SAID THAT I.C.E. AGENTS

823
00:40:47,523 --> 00:40:50,663
WILL NOW
BE PERMITTED TO ARREST MIGRANTS
IN CHURCHES.

824
00:40:50,663 --> 00:40:54,385
AND I CAN'T WAIT UNTIL LAW
ENFORCEMENT BURSTS INTO A CHURCH

825
00:40:54,385 --> 00:40:57,805
AND THE PRIEST IS LIKE, "THOSE
KIDS ARE LYING!"

826
00:41:02,582 --> 00:41:05,321
>>> ON PRESIDENT TRUMP'S FIRST
DAY IN OFFICE,

827
00:41:05,321 --> 00:41:10,117
HE SIGNED 26
EXECUTIVE ORDERS, 12 MEMOS, 4
PROCLAMATIONS,

828
00:41:10,117 --> 00:41:13,071
AND REVOKED 78
BIDEN EXECUTIVE ACTIONS.

829
00:41:13,071 --> 00:41:16,831
THEN THAT NIGHT, BIG CLOG IN THE
TOILET.

830

>>> ELON MUSK WAS CRITICIZED FOR
HIS SPEECH AT A RALLY
AFTER THE
INAUGURATION

831
00:41:21,962 --> 00:41:24,647
IN WHICH HE APPEARS
TO GIVE THE NAZI SALUTE.

832
00:41:24,647 --> 00:41:26,767
BUT COME ON, ELON MUSK IS NOT A
NAZI.

833
00:41:26,767 --> 00:41:29,959
THE NAZIS MADE NICE CARS.

834
00:41:33,086 --> 00:41:35,993
>>> THE WHITE HOUSE SHARED
IMAGES OF ILLEGAL MIGRANTS

835

BEING
PLACED ON MILITARY PLANES TO BE
DEPORTED.

836
00:41:39,010 --> 00:41:41,571
AND TRUMP SAID THE DEPORTATIONS
WON'T STOP

837
00:41:41,571 --> 00:41:45,256
UNTIL A WHITE KID
WINS THE SPELLING BEE.

838
00:41:47,284 --> 00:41:50,546
>>> YESTERDAY, PRESIDENT TRUMP
AND FIRST LADY MELANIA

HURRICANE DAMAGE IN NORTH CAROLINA,

840
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:57,538
AND FOR SOME REASON,
THEY WERE DRESSED LIKE JAY AND
SILENT BOB.

841
00:41:58,263 --> 00:42:02,425
>>> CONGRESSWOMAN LAUREN BOEBERT
TRIED TO HAVE A MAN KICKED OUT

842
00:42:02,425 --> 00:42:04,675
OF THE WOMEN'S ROOM IN THE CAPITOL BUILDING,

843
00:42:04,675 --> 00:42:06,541
BUT IT TURNED
OUT TO BE A WOMAN.

844
00:42:06,541 --> 00:42:10,411
IN BOEBERT'S DEFENSE, MARJORIE
WAS STANDING UP.

845
00:42:15,568 --> 00:42:19,477
>>> TRUMP ALSO SIGNED AN
EXECUTIVE ORDER DIRECTING THE
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

846

TO END ALL
DIVERSITY, EQUITY, AND INCLUSION
PROGRAMS.

847
00:42:23,428 --> 00:42:27,616
WORSE, THE ORDER BEGAN, "LISTEN
UP, GAYWADS."

848
00:42:28,549 --> 00:42:31,861
>>> JUST DAYS INTO HIS SECOND
TERM, TRUMP BEGAN TO SIGN

HERE TO COMMENT IS GISELE, A
CONCERNED BUSINESSWOMAN.

853
00:42:46,603 --> 00:42:51,048
YOU KNOW, I'M SORRY.
IS IT OKAY IF I JUST TALK
DIRECTLY TO THE PEOPLE?

854
00:42:51,048 --> 00:42:52,520
>> YEAH, I GUESS.

00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:56,223
>> THIS IS A VERY SCARY TIME FOR
US.

AND I AM SPEAKING AS A BLACK
WOMAN.

859
00:43:06,274 --> 00:43:08,592
IT IS TIME TO ACT.

EXTENSIONS YOU NEED BEFORE THOSE

>> GISELE, IT'S NOT THAT
SERIOUS.

867
00:43:30,246 --> 00:43:33,145
>> NOT THAT SERIOUS?
YOU NEED TO BE FREAKING OUT TOO,
CHE.

FADE.

869
00:43:37,063 --> 00:43:41,156

OVERREACTING.
CAN'T YOU WEAR YOUR NATURAL
HAIR?

870
00:43:41,156 --> 00:43:44,706
>> WHAT NATURAL HAIR?
I AM BALD UNDER THIS.

871
00:43:44,706 --> 00:43:47,860
MY REAL HAIR'S NOT EVEN LONG
ENOUGH FOR A BOWL CUT.

872
00:43:47,860 --> 00:43:50,496
THEY GOT TO USE A PLATE.

873
00:43:50,690 --> 00:43:54,715
AND I KNOW SOME WOMEN CAN PULL
OFF THE BALD LOOK, BUT I CAN'T.

874
00:43:54,715 --> 00:43:57,606
MY HEAD IS LUMPIER THAN THE
APPALACHIAN TRAIL.

875
00:43:57,606 --> 00:43:59,322
>> I'M SURE IT'S NOT THAT BAD.

876
00:43:59,322 --> 00:44:02,733
GISELE, YOU KNOW, A LOT OF
SUCCESSFUL BLACK WOMEN WEAR
THEIR HAIR NATURAL.

877
00:44:02,733 --> 00:44:06,163
LOOK AT JOY ANN REID, WHOOPI
GOLDBERG, WANDA SYKES.

878
00:44:06,163 --> 00:44:10,368

AND WHILE YOU REALLY PULLED SOME

SMASH, CHE?

881
00:44:16,631 --> 00:44:19,508
>> I AM NOT ANSWERING THAT.
>> YEAH,

882
00:44:19,508 --> 00:44:23,971
IF I HAD KNOWN TRUMP
WAS GOING TO DO THIS, I WOULD
HAVE NEVER VOTED FOR HIM.

883
00:44:23,971 --> 00:44:26,011
>> YOU VOTED FOR TRUMP?
>> YEAH.

THE CASE FOR ALL BLACK WOMEN.

HAVE HAIR?

01:02:43,460 --> 01:02:45,293
YOU, YOU WONDERFUL, WONDERFUL

1267
01:02:45,295 --> 01:02:45,560
MAN.

1268
01:02:45,562 --> 01:02:47,729
>> OH, JUST DOING MY JOB.

1269
01:02:47,731 --> 01:02:48,830
SOMEONE GET THIS WOMAN A GLASS

1270
01:02:48,832 --> 01:02:50,899
OF WATER AND AN ALTOID.

1271
01:02:50,901 --> 01:02:51,766
>> THERE WERE NO PADDLES.

1272
01:02:51,768 --> 01:02:54,603
WHY DID HE SAY CLEAR?

1273
01:02:54,605 --> 01:02:57,138
>> WELL, I WAS SITTING THE

1274
01:02:57,140 --> 01:02:58,840
CLOSEST, I KNOW WHY HE SAID

1275
01:02:58,842 --> 01:02:59,174
CLEAR.

1276
01:02:59,576 --> 01:03:00,742
>> WHAT DID WE JUST WITNESS?

1277
01:03:00,744 --> 01:03:03,311
>> WE WITNESSED ANOTHER VICTORY

1278
01:03:03,313 --> 01:03:04,312
FOR MODERN SCIENCE.

1279
01:03:04,314 --> 01:03:05,747
YOU KNOW, IT'S FUNNY.

1280
01:03:05,749 --> 01:03:08,416
JUST THIS MORNING, I WAS EATING

1281
01:03:08,418 --> 01:03:10,085
BREAKFAST AT WHITE CASTLE

1282
01:03:10,087 --> 01:03:11,453
WONDERING IF I WAS EVEN MAKING A

1283
01:03:11,455 --> 01:03:11,853
DIFFERENCE.

1284
01:03:11,855 --> 01:03:13,054
>> BREAKFAST AT WHITE CASTLE?

1285
01:03:13,056 --> 01:03:15,190
>> UH-HUH, THEN EVEN WHEN I WAS

1286
01:03:15,192 --> 01:03:19,294
EATING DEVILED EGG JUMBALAYA FOR

1287
01:03:19,296 --> 01:03:21,263
LUNCH, WAS WONDERING, WHAT'S THE

1288
01:03:21,265 --> 01:03:22,430
POINT OF ALL OF THIS?

1289
01:03:22,432 --> 01:03:23,531
WHEN I WAS WALKING DOWNTOWN

1290
01:03:23,533 --> 01:03:25,033
THROUGH THE CHILI CONTEST

1291
01:03:25,035 --> 01:03:28,136
SAMPLING ALL THE ETHNIC ONES, I

1292
01:03:28,138 --> 01:03:30,238
REMEMBERED SOMETHING.

1293
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:30,739
LIFE IS PRECIOUS.

1294
01:03:30,741 --> 01:03:31,640
>> HOW ARE YOU FEELING, MOM?

1295
01:03:31,642 --> 01:03:32,974
>> STRANGE, SON.

1296
01:03:32,976 --> 01:03:34,209
EVERYTHING WENT DARK, AND THEN

1297
01:03:34,211 --> 01:03:36,544
SUDDENLY I HEARD THE SOUND OF

1298
01:03:36,546 --> 01:03:37,245
GABRIEL'S HORN CALLING ME TO

1299
01:03:37,247 --> 01:03:39,381
HEAVEN.

1300
01:03:39,383 --> 01:03:40,582
>> THAT WASN'T NO GABRIEL'S

1301
01:03:40,584 --> 01:03:40,882
HORN.

1302
01:03:43,287 --> 01:03:46,688
>> WELL, WHATEVER IT WAS, IT WAS

1303
01:03:46,690 --> 01:03:46,988
LOUD.

1304
01:03:46,990 --> 01:03:48,890
AND THEN WHEN I GOT TO HEAVEN,

1305
01:03:48,892 --> 01:03:51,760
IT WAS THE STRANGEST THING.

1306
01:03:51,762 --> 01:03:54,896
IT SMELLED AND TASTED LIKE A

1307
01:03:54,898 --> 01:03:55,230
CHALUPA.

1308
01:03:55,232 --> 01:03:56,197
>> OH, YEAH.

1309
01:03:56,600 --> 01:03:58,700
I ALSO WENT TO TACO BELL.

1310
01:03:58,702 --> 01:04:01,937
>> ANYWAY, NOW IT SEEMS LIKE I'M

1311
01:04:01,939 --> 01:04:04,506
SEEING THE WORLD THROUGH

1312
01:04:04,508 --> 01:04:05,206
ROSE-COLORED GLASSES.

1313
01:04:05,208 --> 01:04:07,509
>> NO, IT JUST SOUNDS LIKE YOU

1314
01:04:07,511 --> 01:04:08,910
HAVE PINKEYE.

1315
01:04:09,313 --> 01:04:11,846
>> SOMEBODY MARK DOWN THE TIME

1316
01:04:11,848 --> 01:04:12,380
FOR THE PARAMEDICS.

1317
01:04:12,382 --> 01:04:13,114
IT'S 3:15.

1318
01:04:13,116 --> 01:04:14,115
>> 3:15?

1319
01:04:14,117 --> 01:04:15,116
I KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS.

1320
01:04:15,118 --> 01:04:16,785
IT'S TIME FOR MY BIRTHDAY KISS.

1321
01:04:16,787 --> 01:04:18,787
>> NO!

1322
01:04:19,189 --> 01:04:20,055
YUCK!

1323
01:04:20,057 --> 01:04:21,656
EWW!

1324
01:04:21,658 --> 01:04:25,226
>> OH, MAN.

1325
01:04:25,228 --> 01:04:27,362
AH -- AH -- OH --

1326
01:04:27,364 --> 01:04:28,296
>> MR. DAVIS, ARE YOU OKAY?

1327
01:04:28,298 --> 01:04:28,697
>> SHUT UP!

1328
01:04:32,169 --> 01:04:33,902
>> YOU'RE HAVING A HEART ATTACK!

1329
01:04:33,904 --> 01:04:35,103
>> NO.

1330
01:04:35,105 --> 01:04:35,370
SHH!

1331
01:04:35,372 --> 01:04:35,837
JUST LET ME DIE.

1332
01:04:37,607 --> 01:04:40,141
DON'T LET THAT AWFUL MAN DO THAT

1333
01:04:40,143 --> 01:04:43,178
TO ME.

1334
01:04:43,180 --> 01:04:45,747
JUST PUTTER ME AROUND LIKE

1335
01:04:45,749 --> 01:04:48,817
WEEKEND AT BERNIE'S TILL HE'S

1336
01:04:48,819 --> 01:04:49,751
OUT OF HERE.

1337
01:04:49,753 --> 01:04:51,953
>> THIS A BIRTHDAY I'LL NEVER

1338
01:04:51,955 --> 01:04:52,287
FORGET.

1339
01:04:52,289 --> 01:04:53,488
>> BECAUSE YOUR WHOLE FAMILY IS

1340
01:04:53,490 --> 01:04:53,788
HERE?

1341
01:04:53,790 --> 01:04:55,590
>> NO, BECAUSE YOUR TWINK

1342
01:04:55,592 --> 01:04:59,027
BOYFRIEND SAT ON MY FACE.

1343
01:04:59,429 --> 01:05:03,898
AND FARTED ME BACK TO LIFE.

1344
01:05:03,900 --> 01:05:05,166
ANYHOO, RAISE YOUR HAND IF YOU'D

1345
01:05:05,168 --> 01:05:06,334
LIKE A SLICE OF CAKE.

1346
01:05:06,336 --> 01:05:07,802
>> TWO SLICES FOR US, PLEASE.

1347
01:05:21,637 --> 01:05:24,142
GOD

1348
01:05:24,142 --> 01:05:25,934
VOLCANO

1349
01:05:25,934 --> 01:05:27,576
>>> SO, I'M CALLING THEM PLANTS.

1350
01:05:27,576 --> 01:05:32,479
AND THE IDEA IS THAT THEY INHALE
CARBON DIOXIDE AND EXHALE
OXYGEN.

1351
01:05:32,479 --> 01:05:33,653
THE OPPOSITE OF ANIMALS.

1352
01:05:33,653 --> 01:05:36,556
>> SO IT ALL BALANCES OUT.
THAT'S REALLY CLEVER.

1353
01:05:36,556 --> 01:05:38,033
HAVE YOU PITCHED IT TO GOD YET?

1354
01:05:38,033 --> 01:05:40,436
>> NO, I WANT TO MAKE SURE ALL
THE KINKS ARE WORKED OUT.

1355
01:05:40,436 --> 01:05:43,164
>> OH MY DOG.
DO YOU MIND, I HAD AN IDEA.

1356
01:05:43,164 --> 01:05:44,338
I THINK WE SHOULD DO IT.
CHECK IT OUT.

1357
01:05:44,338 --> 01:05:47,710
IT'S LIKE A MOUNTAIN, RIGHT,
THAT EXPLODES.

1358
01:05:47,710 --> 01:05:48,966
>> IT EXPLODES?

1359
01:05:48,966 --> 01:05:51,436
>> YES.
SO TAKE THE INSIDE OF THE EARTH,
IT'S GOING TO COME TO THE
OUTSIDE.

1360
01:05:51,436 --> 01:05:55,284
IT'S LIKE FIRE AND [ BLEEP ].
IT'S SICK.
LET'S GET GOING ON THESE.

1361
01:05:55,284 --> 01:05:58,417
>> OKAY.
HEY, SINCE YOU'RE HERE, THERE'S
AN IDEA FOR SOMETHING CALLED --

1362
01:05:58,417 --> 01:06:01,593
>> THAT'S GREAT, I DON'T WANT TO
HEAR ABOUT IT, BUT LET'S DO
EXPLODING MOUNTAINS FIRST.

1363
01:06:01,593 --> 01:06:03,636
AND HEY, YOU GUYS, YOU'RE
KILLING IT.

1364
01:06:03,636 --> 01:06:06,287
KANGAROO

1365
01:06:06,287 --> 01:06:08,190
WHAT AM I LOOKING AT?
WHAT IS THIS?

1366
01:06:08,190 --> 01:06:10,451
>> WE THOUGHT IT WAS GOOD.
>> YEAH, YOU THOUGHT IT WAS
GOOD?

1367
01:06:10,451 --> 01:06:14,440
IT'S A GIANT BOUNCING RAT WITH A
CAMEL HEAD AND HUMAN ARMS.
IT'S NOT GOOD.

1368
01:06:14,440 --> 01:06:17,809
>> I'M SORRY.
>> WHAT'S IN THIS POUCH ON ITS
STOMACH?

1369
01:06:17,809 --> 01:06:22,540
>> THOSE ARE THE BABIES THAT
CRAWL IN THERE AFTER THEY'RE
BORN.

1370
01:06:26,278 --> 01:06:27,470
>> GET OUT.

1371
01:06:27,470 --> 01:06:29,976
SELF PLEASURE

1372
01:06:29,976 --> 01:06:32,426
>> STUPID.
SUCKS.

1373
01:06:32,426 --> 01:06:34,013
- HEY
- HI, WHAT'S UP?

1374
01:06:34,013 --> 01:06:35,469
>> JUST WANTED TO FLOG
SOMETHING.

1375
01:06:35,469 --> 01:06:38,717
WITH THE HUMANS YOU ASKED US TO
MAKE IT SO THEIR PRIVATE AREAS

1376
01:06:38,717 --> 01:06:41,023
FELT VERY GOOD WHEN THEY'RE
CREATING BABIES.
>> YEAH.

1377
01:06:41,023 --> 01:06:45,506
>> WELL, IN TESTING WE REALIZED
THEY CAN GET THAT SAME FEELING
ING THEIR OWN HANDS.

1378
01:06:45,506 --> 01:06:48,127
>> HEARD, YEAH.
I'LL TELL THEM NOT TO DO THAT.

1379
01:06:48,127 --> 01:06:51,438
>> IF ONE OF THEM DOES DO IT
ANYWAY, WHAT SHOULD WE --

1380
01:06:51,438 --> 01:06:52,897
>> STRAIGHT TO HELL FOREVER.

1381
01:06:52,897 --> 01:06:54,940
SOLAR

1382
01:06:54,940 --> 01:06:56,788
>> IT'S REALLY GREAT.
>> SO GOOD.

1383
01:06:56,788 --> 01:06:59,055
>> ALL THESE PLANETS AND THIS
GRAVITY IDEA.

1384
01:06:59,055 --> 01:07:00,779
>> THE MOONS.
>> WE KILLED IT.

1385
01:07:00,779 --> 01:07:03,613
>> YEAH, TOTALLY AGREE.
THE WHOLE SOLAR SYSTEM SLAPS.

1386
01:07:03,613 --> 01:07:05,759
THE PLANETS, THEN MY IDEA FOR GOOBIE,

1387
01:07:05,759 --> 01:07:08,409
THE GIANT CREATURE WITH
THE SUN IN ITS MOUTH.
IT'S LIKE BRILLIANT.

1388
01:07:08,409 --> 01:07:10,913
THEN ALL THE STARS AND STUFF
AROUND IT, IT'S LIKE, IT REALLY
WORKS.

1389
01:07:10,913 --> 01:07:13,626
>> HEY, GOD, ABOUT GOOBIE?

1390
01:07:13,626 --> 01:07:16,529
WE ACTUALLY THINK MAYBE IT'S A
LITTLE BETTER

1391
01:07:16,529 --> 01:07:19,285
TO JUST HAVE THE
SUN BY ITSELF.

1392
01:07:19,285 --> 01:07:20,966
>> OH, I DON'T QUITE GET WHAT --

1393
01:07:20,966 --> 01:07:22,487
>> HERE, LET ME JUST SHOW YOU.

1394
01:07:22,487 --> 01:07:25,085
SEE?
DOESN'T THAT FEEL BETTER?

1395
01:07:25,085 --> 01:07:28,961
BECAUSE IT'S JUST CLEANER.
>> IT'S TOTALLY CLEANER.

1396
01:07:32,202 --> 01:07:34,437
>> TELL HIM THE IDEA.
>> OKAY.

1397
01:07:34,437 --> 01:07:37,323
HEY, GOD.
YOU KNOW WHAT WE COULD DO, WE
COULD KEEP GOOBIE

1398
01:07:37,323 --> 01:07:40,205
AS MAYBE A
SMALL ANIMAL ON EARTH.

1399
01:07:40,205 --> 01:07:42,958
WOULD IT -- WHAT WOULD IT LOOK
LIKE?

1400
01:07:42,958 --> 01:07:46,581
>> SOMETHING LIKE THIS, MAYBE.

1401
01:07:47,035 --> 01:07:50,419
>> AND THERE WOULD BE A LOT OF
THEM?
>> YEAH, THEY COULD BE
EVERYWHERE.

1402
01:07:50,419 --> 01:07:52,344
WE COULD PUT THEM IN PONDS.
>> SWAMPS.

1403
01:07:52,344 --> 01:07:55,541
>> AND WE'LL CALL THEM FROGS.

1404
01:07:55,541 --> 01:07:58,558
FROGS, OKAY, YEAH.
OKAY, I'M GOOD WITH THAT.

1405
01:07:58,558 --> 01:08:01,032
SORRY I GOT A LITTLE WEIRD
THERE.

1406
01:08:21,765 --> 01:08:22,430
>>> ALL RIGHT.

1407
01:08:22,432 --> 01:08:23,031
MAN, THANK YOU SO MUCH.

1408
01:08:23,033 --> 01:08:25,934
