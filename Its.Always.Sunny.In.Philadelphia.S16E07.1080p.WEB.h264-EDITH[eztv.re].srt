1
00:00:08,303 --> 00:00:10,910
I'm-a order some
chili cheese fries.

2
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:13,594
-Oh, yeah? Get me some.
-Anybody else want an order?

3
00:00:13,594 --> 00:00:18,451
A delivery
of chili cheese fries?
They'll be mush by the time
they get here. No way.

4
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:20,509
-Ah! Shit.

5
00:00:20,509 --> 00:00:23,770
What are you doing, man?
You can't hit it that hard.

6
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:25,540
You got to use more finesse.

7
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:29,395
Well, finesse isn't
really my style, Charlie.
I like to dominate the table
into submission.

8
00:00:29,395 --> 00:00:31,932
Dennis, I got to head out.
Tip me out.

9
00:00:31,932 --> 00:00:33,720
- What?
-Give me my tips.

10
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:35,423
What tips, Dee?
What are you talking about?

11
00:00:35,423 --> 00:00:37,163
Hey, any of you guys
tip Dee today?

12
00:00:37,163 --> 00:00:39,492
-For what?
-Hell no.

13
00:00:39,492 --> 00:00:42,122
- No.
- All right, whatever.
Just give me 40 bucks
from the register.

14
00:00:42,122 --> 00:00:45,282
- What do you need money for?
- I'm going out.
I just need a little cash.

15
00:00:45,282 --> 00:00:46,480
Where you going?

16
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:50,971
I'm going to a fancy place with
some fancy new friends of mine.

17
00:00:50,971 --> 00:00:54,148
-What friends?
-What is happening?
Why is everyone
asking me questions?

18
00:00:54,148 --> 00:00:57,352
Well, it's 'cause you're
sneaking around trying
to steal money
that you haven't earned

19
00:00:57,352 --> 00:01:00,818
and looking like
Carmen Sandiego.
I mean, what-what
are we supposed to think?

20
00:01:00,818 --> 00:01:02,259
-W-What are you hiding, Dee?
-What?

21
00:01:02,259 --> 00:01:03,644
-Let me see
what's under that coat.
-No.

22
00:01:03,644 --> 00:01:05,005
-I want to see what's under it.
-No.

23
00:01:05,005 --> 00:01:06,771
-Show me.
-She's hiding something, Dennis.

24
00:01:06,771 --> 00:01:09,511
You want me to hold her down
and rip it off her?

25
00:01:10,484 --> 00:01:14,157
-Yeah.
-Stop it.
Stop. Stop it. Don't touch me.

26
00:01:14,157 --> 00:01:15,943
Don't touch me. Okay?

27
00:01:15,943 --> 00:01:20,192
I decided that I want
to take off the coat,

28
00:01:20,192 --> 00:01:23,566
'cause it's hot in here.

29
00:01:24,936 --> 00:01:27,865
Bowling? That's the fancy outing
you were, uh, hiding from us?

30
00:01:27,865 --> 00:01:29,456
Dee, why were you hiding
that from us?

31
00:01:29,456 --> 00:01:34,006
Because it's my thing, okay?
It's not your thing,
and I don't want
you guys getting involved.

32
00:01:34,349 --> 00:01:39,519
-As if.
-As if, Dee.
-As if.
-As if.
-As if, Dee. As if.

33
00:01:39,519 --> 00:01:42,467
Yeah, okay. All right.
Well, I'm gonna head out.

34
00:01:42,467 --> 00:01:46,752
You guys enjoy sitting around
with your ding-dongs in your
hand doing nothing all night.

35
00:01:49,032 --> 00:01:52,092
-Ding-dongs in our hand--
What is she talking--
What a bitch. 
-Yeah.

36
00:01:52,092 --> 00:01:54,244
My ding-dong wasn't even in
my hand. I mean, what do you...

37
00:01:54,244 --> 00:01:55,803
-Mine was.
-Yeah, so was mine.

38
00:01:55,803 --> 00:01:57,403
Yeah, I was scratching mine
when she said that.

39
00:01:57,403 --> 00:02:00,335
I-I had my hands
fully down my pants,
if I'm being honest.

40
00:02:00,335 --> 00:02:01,832
I had to push it to the left.

41
00:02:01,832 --> 00:02:03,733
-They get itchy in there.
-That's a, such a coincidence.

42
00:02:03,733 --> 00:02:07,184
-That is a lucky guess.
-That's a crazy-- yeah.
-It was a lucky guess.
-It was a lucky guess.

43
00:02:07,184 --> 00:02:09,896
But that's not the point.
Look-look, the point is...

44
00:02:09,896 --> 00:02:13,366
...we have
a lot better things to do
than just go bowling.

45
00:02:13,366 --> 00:02:16,390
BOWLING

46
00:02:38,219 --> 00:02:41,111
Oh, hello, ladies.
You ready to roll?

47
00:02:41,111 --> 00:02:42,427
Why is everybody
sitting on their butts?

48
00:02:42,427 --> 00:02:44,425
We've been waiting here
for 20 minutes.

49
00:02:44,425 --> 00:02:49,825
Okay, well, listen,
things are just gonna be
a little different
if you want me on your team.
I show up when I want.

50
00:02:49,825 --> 00:02:52,709
Well, we don't want you
on our team.
It's just that our fourth
didn't show up

51
00:02:52,709 --> 00:02:55,047
and literally no one else
was free on a Friday night.

52
00:02:55,047 --> 00:02:56,002
-So you want me to be here.

53
00:02:56,002 --> 00:02:57,192
-Not really.
Awesome. Good.

54
00:02:57,192 --> 00:02:59,030
Do you have the $35 team fee?

55
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:03,417
-Ooh, I do not, but I have...
...something
much more valuable:

56
00:03:03,417 --> 00:03:04,485
my expertise.

57
00:03:04,485 --> 00:03:06,226
So listen to me
and you'll be in business.

58
00:03:06,226 --> 00:03:08,957
Anyone want to snort
Jell-O shots?

59
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:10,710
-Oh...
- Snail?
You're on the team?

60
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:14,418
Yeah, I love bowling.
The whole scene is so hot.

61
00:03:14,418 --> 00:03:18,049
I sucked off a rando
in the parking lot.
Ugh, my mouth hurts.

62
00:03:18,049 --> 00:03:20,633
Gross. Waitress,
you're responsible for this?

63
00:03:20,633 --> 00:03:23,216
I'm not responsible for this,
but this is my team, okay?

64
00:03:23,216 --> 00:03:27,533
So you can't just come in here
and take over,
come in late,
not have your money, okay?

65
00:03:27,533 --> 00:03:30,815
I signed us up, I booked
the lane, I made us shirts.

66
00:03:30,815 --> 00:03:35,288
I even found us an appliance
company to sponsor us.
Frige-it.

67
00:03:35,354 --> 00:03:37,141
-"Frige-it Bitches"?
- Yeah.

68
00:03:37,141 --> 00:03:39,171
-God, you guys are stupid.
I'm not wearing this.

69
00:03:39,171 --> 00:03:40,445
-No, it's so funny.
-It's not funny.

70
00:03:40,445 --> 00:03:42,701
-We've been laughing all night.
-That doesn't surprise me.

71
00:03:42,701 --> 00:03:45,936
Now listen up.
We're not here to laugh
or be funny.

72
00:03:45,936 --> 00:03:48,924
-We're here to win.
Which you can do
if you listen to me.

73
00:03:48,924 --> 00:03:52,480
Or perhaps I should let
my balls do the talking.

74
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,858
-Please do.
-Yeah.

75
00:04:02,803 --> 00:04:04,620
-Hot shit, Dee.

76
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:05,877
-Do I have your attention?

77
00:04:05,877 --> 00:04:08,852
- Well, well, well.
-Oh, God.
-What?

78
00:04:08,852 --> 00:04:12,098
Pretty nice roll, Deandra.
Too bad it'll be your last.

79
00:04:12,098 --> 00:04:15,796
- Can you please just leave and
let me have one thing to myself?
- Nah.

80
00:04:15,796 --> 00:04:19,659
So these, uh, "frigid bitches,"
these are your new
"fancy friends"?

81
00:04:19,659 --> 00:04:23,882
- What is this,
some kind of women's league?
- It's a coed tournament.

82
00:04:23,882 --> 00:04:28,311
- So you'll be
competing against men?
- Vaginas and penises
together again.

83
00:04:28,311 --> 00:04:32,505
I'll tell you what,
why don't we join this league
and have ourselves
a little competition?

84
00:04:32,505 --> 00:04:36,262
Or are y
ou too scared
that you'll lose to us?

85
00:04:39,073 --> 00:04:41,720
He did one, so I thought
we were doing... Okay.

86
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:42,697
Shit.

87
00:04:42,697 --> 00:04:43,916
Anyone got a straw?

88
00:04:43,916 --> 00:04:47,896
-I didn't know.
-Okay.
-It's fine. All right.
-Hey!
-Hey, guys?
-Let's have it.

89
00:04:47,973 --> 00:04:50,299
Oh, for Christ's sakes.
- Shit.
-Are you kidding me?

90
00:04:50,299 --> 00:04:52,658
-Please tell me
you guys don't own
this bowling alley.

91
00:04:52,658 --> 00:04:55,731
We got out
of the video rental business
just after the bubble burst.

92
00:04:55,731 --> 00:04:57,589
Bowling's always been
in our blood.

93
00:04:57,589 --> 00:05:01,312
Ryan's got the forearms
of an elephant wrangler.
He could have been pro.

94
00:05:01,312 --> 00:05:04,514
I could have been.
If not for my tragic accident.

95
00:05:04,514 --> 00:05:07,271
The story is too horrible
for words, so don't ask me...

96
00:05:07,271 --> 00:05:10,966
-We-we...
-We're not gonna ask.
We don't really care
-about that, yeah.
-You can keep that to yourself.

97
00:05:10,966 --> 00:05:13,107
I'd tell you, but you wouldn't
be able to handle it.

98
00:05:13,107 --> 00:05:15,810
-You clearly want to tell us,
but we're not here for it.
-We don't want to hear it.

99
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:18,694
Listen, I'm moving past this.
Can we sign up for the league?
-Impossible.

100
00:05:18,694 --> 00:05:23,095
-Why, is it too late to sign up?
- No, you just couldn't afford it.

101
00:05:23,095 --> 00:05:25,047
-How much is it?
-$35.

102
00:05:25,047 --> 00:05:26,765
-We got that.
-Well, we got that, yeah.
That's fine.

103
00:05:26,765 --> 00:05:28,282
Each.

104
00:05:28,948 --> 00:05:33,223
-Uh, do you mind covering us?
-That's still...
W-We're good, we're good, yeah.

105
00:05:33,223 --> 00:05:36,576
- Hey, listen, can we play
the Frigid Bitches first?
- Sure, whatever.
I don't give a shit.

106
00:05:36,576 --> 00:05:38,221
You guys got
chili cheese fries here?

107
00:05:38,221 --> 00:05:41,222
Franklin, we do have chili
and we do have cheese
and we do have fries,

108
00:05:41,222 --> 00:05:43,047
but combining them
is strictly prohibited.

109
00:05:43,047 --> 00:05:45,629
-Why?
-The story is too terrible
to tell.

110
00:05:45,629 --> 00:05:47,665
-Oh, for Christ's sake.
Nobody cares.
-Oh, Christ's sake.

111
00:05:47,665 --> 00:05:49,571
-Sign us up for the league.
-We won't combine the fries.

112
00:05:49,571 --> 00:05:51,081
Make sure we're playing
the Frigid Bitches.

113
00:05:51,081 --> 00:05:54,814
Yeah, give us some shoes.
W-What size shoe...
We'll get the shoes.

114
00:05:54,814 --> 00:05:58,449
Three, two, one and smile.

115
00:05:58,449 --> 00:06:01,216
-Great.
Let me check that picture.

116
00:06:01,216 --> 00:06:02,323
-How's my ass look?
-Okay.

117
00:06:02,356 --> 00:06:03,958
-That looks pretty good.

118
00:06:03,991 --> 00:06:05,793
Oh, it looks huge. Sick.

119
00:06:05,826 --> 00:06:08,429
Can we take another? I wasn't
sufficiently in character.

120
00:06:08,462 --> 00:06:10,064
-In character?
-Yes, character.

121
00:06:10,097 --> 00:06:11,799
I'm researching
a character I'm playing

122
00:06:11,832 --> 00:06:14,869
named Donna Brunswick of
the Brunswick Bowling Dynasty.

123
00:06:14,902 --> 00:06:17,004
Oh, goddamn. You guys are not
taking this seriously.

124
00:06:17,037 --> 00:06:18,572
Okay? Let's cut the BS.

125
00:06:18,606 --> 00:06:20,441
As your leader,
I demand we cut the BS.

126
00:06:20,474 --> 00:06:21,575
Now let's talk order.

127
00:06:21,609 --> 00:06:23,777
I'm thinking Snail, Artemis,

128
00:06:23,811 --> 00:06:25,813
-Waitress, best for last.
- Okay,
I'm just gonna remind you

129
00:06:25,846 --> 00:06:28,082
that you're not the leader
and you can't be the leader

130
00:06:28,115 --> 00:06:29,750
'cause you don't even know
everyone's names.

131
00:06:29,783 --> 00:06:31,652
Mm, can you switch mine
to "Donna"?

132
00:06:31,685 --> 00:06:33,921
-No.
- Well, well, well.
Looks like

133
00:06:33,954 --> 00:06:37,491
the Frigid Bitches are going up
against the Hanging Monster Dong

134
00:06:37,525 --> 00:06:40,694
Lucky Strike
Chili Cheese Fryers.

135
00:06:40,728 --> 00:06:42,463
Is that your name?
That's really stupid.

136
00:06:42,496 --> 00:06:43,731
-It's too many ideas, man.
-I told you it was stupid.

137
00:06:43,764 --> 00:06:45,566
I-I knew they were gonna
make fun of us

138
00:06:45,599 --> 00:06:47,334
-and they did make fun of us.
-Yeah, 'cause it's stupid.

139
00:06:47,368 --> 00:06:48,836
You know what?
Uh, but it doesn't matter,

140
00:06:48,869 --> 00:06:50,471
'cause you guys are dead meat.

141
00:06:50,504 --> 00:06:53,374
Hey, did Dee happen
to tell you the history

142
00:06:53,407 --> 00:06:55,309
of her experience with bowling?

143
00:06:55,342 --> 00:06:57,511
-No.
-You should tell them,
you should tell them.

144
00:06:57,545 --> 00:06:59,780
-You tell them, you tell them.
-Tell them, tell them.
-I-I was about to.

145
00:06:59,814 --> 00:07:01,882
-I don't know.
-Oh, you were?
-I was about to. Yes.

146
00:07:01,916 --> 00:07:04,051
- Are we doing
the laugh?
-He's gonna tell you.

147
00:07:04,084 --> 00:07:05,753
-Are we doing laughs?
-Yeah, uh, no.
I'll just tell it.

148
00:07:05,786 --> 00:07:07,988
-He's gonna tell you.
-Okay, well, when she was a kid,

149
00:07:08,022 --> 00:07:10,524
she was, well,
she was pretty decent.

150
00:07:10,558 --> 00:07:12,893
And I got to say, she worked
really, really hard at it.

151
00:07:12,927 --> 00:07:16,597
So, she eventually became
the captain of the girls' team.

152
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:17,865
Can you believe that?

153
00:07:17,898 --> 00:07:20,334
Now, I'm no fan
of women's sports.

154
00:07:20,367 --> 00:07:22,303
-Who is?
-Yeah, they're not very popular.
-Nobody is.

155
00:07:22,336 --> 00:07:23,871
Nobody watches--
Especially women.

156
00:07:23,904 --> 00:07:24,872
Women don't even like
women's sports.

157
00:07:24,905 --> 00:07:26,740
So I wouldn't have it.

158
00:07:26,774 --> 00:07:31,512
And to prove that Dee's
female mind was mentally weak,

159
00:07:31,545 --> 00:07:33,514
I started to go watch her,

160
00:07:33,547 --> 00:07:36,517
and I would say, "gutter ball"

161
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:39,954
right before she rolled it,
and wouldn't you know it,

162
00:07:39,987 --> 00:07:43,057
every time I said it,

163
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:45,726
she'd roll a gutter ball.

164
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:50,030
Since then, if I even so much
as look at Dee when she bowls,

165
00:07:50,064 --> 00:07:52,633
she can't knock down
a single pin.

166
00:07:52,666 --> 00:07:56,070
Not even one.

167
00:07:56,103 --> 00:08:00,407
 Well, that's
a bit of an exaggeration.

168
00:08:00,441 --> 00:08:02,343

lead us off against Snail.

-Uh, Frank?

00:12:33,848 --> 00:12:37,418
Yeah. Yet another reason why
women can't compete with men.

297
00:12:37,451 --> 00:12:39,019
Besides your
physical limitations,

298
00:12:39,053 --> 00:12:41,422
if given the opportunity
to either work together

299
00:12:41,455 --> 00:12:44,458
as a team
or tear each other apart,

300
00:12:44,492 --> 00:12:46,460
you will always choose
the latter.

301
00:12:46,494 --> 00:12:51,298
Because women are devious
a-and destructive

302
00:12:51,332 --> 00:12:54,401
and will always default
to using their insidious venom

303
00:12:54,435 --> 00:12:56,670
on the most sought-after
victim of all...

304
00:12:57,738 --> 00:12:59,740
...each other.

305
00:13:03,777 --> 00:13:05,846
Okay, Dennis is right.
Just hear me out.

306
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:08,015
If we want to win,
we can't compete like men,

307
00:13:08,048 --> 00:13:10,551
but what we can do
is use those skills

308
00:13:10,584 --> 00:13:12,887
of mental manipulation
against them.

309
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:14,388
Do you want to know why?

310
00:13:14,421 --> 00:13:15,523
Why?

311
00:13:15,556 --> 00:13:18,526
Because... they're stupid.

312
00:13:21,695 --> 00:13:24,565
Hey,
Mac, how come
you throw the ball so straight?

313
00:13:24,598 --> 00:13:26,734
I throw the ball straight
because, as a man,

314
00:13:26,767 --> 00:13:28,936
dominance is my sporting style.

315
00:13:28,969 --> 00:13:31,906
Uh, I heard it's 'cause
you have no finesse.

316
00:13:31,939 --> 00:13:34,408
-You don't know
how to spin the ball.
-What?

317
00:13:34,441 --> 00:13:35,876
-Yeah.
-I have finesse.
I could spin the ball.

318
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:37,411
-You want to see me?
-Yeah.

319
00:13:37,444 --> 00:13:38,612
-Yeah...
-Hey, uh, Mac? Mac?

320
00:13:38,646 --> 00:13:39,880
Can I talk to you for a second?

321
00:13:39,914 --> 00:13:41,015
Yeah.

322
00:13:41,048 --> 00:13:43,317
Do not try and spin the ball.

323
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:45,519
She said that I can't spin,
and I can spin.

324
00:13:45,553 --> 00:13:47,455
-You-- Do not try it.
-But Dennis, she said
I have no finesse,

325
00:13:47,488 --> 00:13:49,423
-and you know
that I have finesse.
-Don't-don't do it.

326
00:13:49,457 --> 00:13:50,558
-Don't do it.
Just play your game.
-Can I just spin one?

327
00:13:50,591 --> 00:13:51,559
-I don't care...
-Let me spin one.

328
00:13:51,592 --> 00:13:52,993
You don't need to spin it.

329
00:13:53,027 --> 00:13:53,928
You just play your game
and we're gonna win.

330
00:13:53,961 --> 00:13:55,362
Okay? Do not spin it.

331
00:13:55,396 --> 00:13:56,630
Do not do it.

332
00:13:58,499 --> 00:14:00,034
Okay, fine.

333
00:14:00,067 --> 00:14:01,869
I won't, I won't spin it.

334
00:14:03,003 --> 00:14:04,538
I won't.

335
00:14:07,775 --> 00:14:09,710
Stride, stride, stride, spin!

336
00:14:11,345 --> 00:14:12,713
Oh, goddamn it!

337
00:14:12,746 --> 00:14:14,815
Gutter ball.

338
00:14:14,849 --> 00:14:15,883
- I'm gonna try it again.
-I'm coming,
I'm coming.

339
00:14:15,916 --> 00:14:16,984
Wait, I'm coming, I'm coming.

340
00:14:17,017 --> 00:14:18,719
Hey, Tyrone, double or nothing!

341
00:14:18,752 --> 00:14:19,854
'Cause there's no way
you're beating me

342
00:14:19,887 --> 00:14:21,322
two out of three, dude!

343
00:14:21,355 --> 00:14:23,324
-Hey, Charlie? Excuse me.

344
00:14:23,357 --> 00:14:24,992
Can I, can I ask your advice
on something?

345
00:14:25,025 --> 00:14:26,994
-Yeah.
-Well, you're just such
a good natural bowler...

346
00:14:27,027 --> 00:14:28,329
-Yeah.
-...and I'm having a hard time,
so I was wondering,

347
00:14:28,362 --> 00:14:30,331
where are you putting your elbow

348
00:14:30,364 --> 00:14:31,932
-when you're rolling?
-My elbow?

349
00:14:31,966 --> 00:14:33,634
Yeah, before you throw the ball,
where is your elbow going?

350
00:14:33,667 --> 00:14:35,469
You-you want me to show you
where my elbow goes?

351
00:14:35,503 --> 00:14:37,538
-Yeah.
-Oh, I'm...

352
00:14:37,571 --> 00:14:39,540
-My-my elbow's like...
-Uh-huh.

353
00:14:39,573 --> 00:14:41,642
That looks good.

354
00:14:42,643 --> 00:14:43,944
Oh.

355
00:14:43,978 --> 00:14:45,346
Gutter ball.

356
00:14:45,379 --> 00:14:46,480
Uh...

357
00:14:46,514 --> 00:14:48,349
Holy shit. It's working.

358
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:54,622
-There we go.
-Okay.

359
00:14:54,655 --> 00:14:55,990
Okay. It's okay.

360
00:14:56,023 --> 00:14:57,424
Damn it!

361
00:14:57,458 --> 00:14:59,393
-Just walk.
-What are you doing?

362
00:14:59,426 --> 00:15:01,996
Stride, stride, stride, spin!
Come on!

363
00:15:02,029 --> 00:15:04,465
-Gutter ball.
-S-Stop it.

364
00:15:04,498 --> 00:15:06,000
Gutter ball.

365
00:15:06,033 --> 00:15:07,935
-Gutter ball.

366
00:15:07,968 --> 00:15:09,036
-Gutter ball.
-Come on.

367
00:15:10,037 --> 00:15:11,338
-Gutter ball.

368
00:15:11,372 --> 00:15:13,307
-Gutter ball.

369
00:15:22,650 --> 00:15:23,984
You want one?

370
00:15:33,961 --> 00:15:35,596
Wh-- Hey!

371
00:15:35,629 --> 00:15:36,730
-What happened?

372
00:15:36,764 --> 00:15:38,466
What the hell happened?

373
00:15:38,499 --> 00:15:40,634
In the third act of my play,
Donna rolls a gutter ball

374
00:15:40,668 --> 00:15:43,003
in the big match
against her rival high school.

375
00:15:43,037 --> 00:15:44,738
-Are you serious?
-Oh, my God.

376
00:15:44,772 --> 00:15:46,574
Can you knock it off
with the play, please?

377
00:15:53,447 --> 00:15:56,484
Ah, well, well,
you done good, ladies.

378
00:15:56,517 --> 00:15:58,853
Your little mind games,
they got you pretty far,

379
00:15:58,886 --> 00:16:01,455
but unfortunately...

380
00:16:01,489 --> 00:16:03,924
...still 11 points shy
in the final frame.

381
00:16:03,958 --> 00:16:06,827
Now, technically,
I could pick up this spare

382
00:16:06,861 --> 00:16:08,963
and push the lead
even further, and I...

383
00:16:08,996 --> 00:16:11,398
think we all know Dee's about
to roll two gutter balls.

384
00:16:11,432 --> 00:16:13,501
So I'll tell you what.
Dee, if you would like,

385
00:16:13,534 --> 00:16:16,337
uh, you could just quit now

386
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:18,539
and you could all admit
that you're inferior

387
00:16:18,572 --> 00:16:20,608
in every single way,

388
00:16:20,641 --> 00:16:22,343
and we could just call it
a night.

389
00:16:22,376 --> 00:16:23,744
Okay, you know what, dick?

390
00:16:23,777 --> 00:16:26,614
I don't like your sister.
She's a terrible person.

391
00:16:26,647 --> 00:16:28,315
-She's a bitch and she's ugly

392
00:16:28,349 --> 00:16:29,683
and I didn't want her
on the team.

393
00:16:29,717 --> 00:16:30,818
And she's gross.

394
00:16:30,851 --> 00:16:32,453
Sure, and she's gross.

395
00:16:32,486 --> 00:16:34,588
But you know what?
You're even worse.

396
00:16:34,622 --> 00:16:36,023
And I am not gonna sit here

397
00:16:36,056 --> 00:16:37,758
and let you just shit on her
all night long.

398
00:16:37,792 --> 00:16:40,728
You think
you're physically superior?

399
00:16:40,761 --> 00:16:43,864
-Yeah.
-Then I challenge you
to a test of strength.

400
00:16:43,898 --> 00:16:45,466
 Come on.

401
00:16:45,499 --> 00:16:46,867
This isn't fair.

402
00:16:46,901 --> 00:16:48,669
Oh. Is it not fair?

403
00:16:48,702 --> 00:16:50,738
Okay, well, if you're scared,
we don't have to do it.

404
00:16:50,771 --> 00:16:52,873
Okay, well, listen,
if you insist, that's fine.

405
00:16:52,907 --> 00:16:54,508
-I do. Okay.
-Let's do it. Yeah.

406
00:16:54,542 --> 00:16:55,810
Ladies first.

407
00:16:55,843 --> 00:16:57,611
-All right, let's do it.
-Oh, thank you.

408
00:16:57,645 --> 00:16:58,846
Go, Waitress, go.

409
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:01,048
-Let's go.
-Give it all you got.

410
00:17:05,586 --> 00:17:07,488
Shit.

411
00:17:07,521 --> 00:17:09,457
-Didn't know you could kick it.
-Oh, yeah, you could kick it.

412
00:17:09,490 --> 00:17:11,325
-And that's fine. Okay.
-Yeah, yeah, okay. Do it.

413
00:17:11,358 --> 00:17:13,060
Show them what you got, Dennis.
Come on.

414
00:17:13,093 --> 00:17:15,663
Let's go, buddy.

415
00:17:15,696 --> 00:17:18,732
I summon the very fact
that I am a man!

416
00:17:29,009 --> 00:17:30,478
I have defeated you.

417
00:17:30,511 --> 00:17:31,879
And of course I have.

418
00:17:31,912 --> 00:17:34,548
I've been blessed
with the genetic gifts to do so.

419
00:17:38,486 --> 00:17:40,921
 I've broken
every single bone in my hand.

420
00:17:40,955 --> 00:17:42,523
I cannot bowl.

421
00:17:42,556 --> 00:17:44,325
-What?
-Really?
-L-Listen to me.

422
00:17:44,358 --> 00:17:45,659
There's nothing solid
left in there.

423
00:17:45,693 --> 00:17:48,362
It's just bloody soup
and bone broth.

424
00:17:48,395 --> 00:17:49,763
All right?
Now, I need to scream.

425
00:17:49,797 --> 00:17:51,031
And I need you to find me
somewhere to scream

426
00:17:51,065 --> 00:17:52,766
so I don't have to do it here.

427
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,635
No, wait a minute.

428
00:17:54,668 --> 00:17:56,670
I'm going to scream here,
and now,

429
00:17:56,704 --> 00:17:58,405
'cause I can't hold it in,
so here we go.

430
00:18:05,513 --> 00:18:07,882
Ryan, I need you to bowl for me.

431
00:18:07,915 --> 00:18:09,483
I'll never bowl again.

432
00:18:09,517 --> 00:18:10,785
-Come on, man.
-Why not? What's the big deal?

433
00:18:10,818 --> 00:18:13,854
The story's
too horrible to tell.

434
00:18:13,888 --> 00:18:15,322
-Oh, with this stuff.
-For fuck's sake,
just spit it out.

435
00:18:15,356 --> 00:18:16,991
Yeah, you clearly want
to tell it, man.

436
00:18:17,024 --> 00:18:18,692
Fine.

437
00:18:18,726 --> 00:18:20,327
-But brace yourself.

438
00:18:20,361 --> 00:18:21,996
There I was,

439
00:18:22,029 --> 00:18:23,964
practicing for
the state semifinals.

440
00:18:27,668 --> 00:18:29,436
I was on my way
to a perfect game.

441
00:18:33,607 --> 00:18:35,976
I was enjoying
some chili cheese fries.

442
00:18:36,010 --> 00:18:38,712
They were delicious,
and I offered some to Ryan.

443
00:18:38,746 --> 00:18:40,848
I accepted, but not realizing

444
00:18:40,881 --> 00:18:42,983
my other hand was
in the ball return lane.

445
00:18:43,017 --> 00:18:45,586
I never should have allowed
myself such indulgences,

446
00:18:45,619 --> 00:18:49,690
because little did I know,
my ball was returning.

447
00:18:56,931 --> 00:18:58,866
It pinched it really bad.

448
00:18:58,899 --> 00:19:01,368
I had a nasty bruise for a week.

449
00:19:01,402 --> 00:19:02,770
-That's it?
-That's why you won't bowl?

450
00:19:02,803 --> 00:19:04,305
-You pinched your finger?
-You pinched your finger

451
00:19:04,338 --> 00:19:05,339
-and you won't bowl?
-Big deal, man.

452
00:19:05,372 --> 00:19:06,774
I'll bowl for you... Dennis.

453
00:19:06,807 --> 00:19:08,476
-Okay, fine.
-Okay.
-Wait, what's happening?

454
00:19:08,509 --> 00:19:09,643
What-what are you saying? What?

455
00:19:09,677 --> 00:19:10,711
-Hmm?
-Well, he...

456
00:19:10,744 --> 00:19:11,979
-Nothing.
-What?

457
00:19:12,012 --> 00:19:13,447
-N-Nothing.
-What's going on?

458
00:19:13,481 --> 00:19:15,616
Liam's gonna bowl for me

459
00:19:15,649 --> 00:19:17,818
because I hurt my hand
a little bit.

460
00:19:17,852 --> 00:19:19,553
O-Ow!

461
00:19:19,587 --> 00:19:21,555
Ow, I just,
I just twisted my ankle.

462
00:19:21,589 --> 00:19:22,723
-No.
-Yeah, and I need Ryan,

463
00:19:22,756 --> 00:19:24,325
I need Ryan to bowl for me.

464
00:19:24,358 --> 00:19:25,559
-No way. No way.
-My ankle is hurt,

465
00:19:25,593 --> 00:19:26,994
and I need Ryan to bowl for me.

466
00:19:27,027 --> 00:19:28,529
-That...
-That is bullshit.

467
00:19:32,533 --> 00:19:34,969
This is incredibly weird.

468
00:19:54,855 --> 00:19:56,690
Ryan!

469
00:19:56,724 --> 00:19:58,959
Brother!
Brother, what have I done?

470
00:20:01,896 --> 00:20:03,564
No!

471
00:20:06,467 --> 00:20:07,568
What the...

472
00:20:13,741 --> 00:20:15,042
Well, well, well, Dee,
it looks like

473
00:20:15,075 --> 00:20:16,777
you're gonna have
to roll after all.

474
00:20:16,811 --> 00:20:19,513
Fine. No problem.

475
00:20:19,547 --> 00:20:21,715
Gonna make my team proud.

476
00:20:21,749 --> 00:20:23,317
Oh, well, maybe you will.

477
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:24,952
Or maybe...

478
00:20:24,985 --> 00:20:26,454
you'll roll a gutter ball.

479
00:20:31,659 --> 00:20:34,695
One pin. That's all.

480
00:20:34,728 --> 00:20:36,030
You can do this.

481
00:20:36,063 --> 00:20:38,566
-Gutter ball.
-No. No.

482
00:20:38,599 --> 00:20:40,701
Just don't think "gutter ball,"
that's all.

483
00:20:43,337 --> 00:20:44,572
Oh, hi, Dee.

484
00:20:44,605 --> 00:20:46,740
I'm in here, too.

485
00:20:46,774 --> 00:20:48,442
Gutter ball.

486
00:20:50,044 --> 00:20:54,014
-Gutter ball. Gutter ball.
-Gutter ball. Gutter ball.

487
00:20:55,549 --> 00:20:57,485
You goddamned son of a--

488
00:20:57,518 --> 00:20:59,653
bitch!

489
00:21:06,994 --> 00:21:08,429
Gutter ball.

490
00:21:18,873 --> 00:21:20,975
-Oh.
-No, no...

491
00:21:22,676 --> 00:21:24,512
-No, no, no...
-No, no...

492
00:21:24,545 --> 00:21:26,747
No, no, no, no...

493
00:21:32,586 --> 00:21:35,456
I did it! In your faces.

494
00:21:35,489 --> 00:21:37,591
Ha... Uh... What's going on?

495
00:21:37,625 --> 00:21:40,427
-Where'd everybody go?
-Frank's having a threesome

496
00:21:40,461 --> 00:21:41,996
in the bathroom
with Gail and Artemis,

497
00:21:42,029 --> 00:21:45,432
and, um, yeah, I think the guys
went to the Sixers game.

498
00:21:45,466 --> 00:21:47,301
What?

499
00:21:47,334 --> 00:21:48,602
Oh, goddamn it.

500
00:21:49,370 --> 00:21:51,372
Well, why aren't you
celebrating?

501
00:21:52,773 --> 00:21:54,909
yeah, honestly?

502
00:21:54,942 --> 00:21:57,745
I don't give a shit
about women's sports.

503
00:21:57,778 --> 00:22:00,014
Well...
