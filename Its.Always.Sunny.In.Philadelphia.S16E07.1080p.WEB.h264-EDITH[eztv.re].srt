1
00:00:08,303 --> 00:00:10,910
I'm-a order some
chili cheese fries.

2
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:13,594
-Oh, yeah? Get me some.
-Anybody else want an order?

3
00:00:13,594 --> 00:00:18,451
A delivery
of chili cheese fries?
They'll be mush by the time
they get here. No way.

4
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:20,509
-Ah! Shit.

5
00:00:20,509 --> 00:00:23,770
What are you doing, man?
You can't hit it that hard.

6
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:25,540
You got to use more finesse.

7
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:29,395
Well, finesse isn't
really my style, Charlie.
I like to dominate the table
into submission.

8
00:00:29,395 --> 00:00:31,932
Dennis, I got to head out.
Tip me out.

9
00:00:31,932 --> 00:00:33,720
- What?
-Give me my tips.

10
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:35,423
What tips, Dee?
What are you talking about?

11
00:00:35,423 --> 00:00:37,163
Hey, any of you guys
tip Dee today?

12
00:00:37,163 --> 00:00:39,492
-For what?
-Hell no.

13
00:00:39,492 --> 00:00:42,122
- No.
- All right, whatever.
Just give me 40 bucks
from the register.

14
00:00:42,122 --> 00:00:45,282
- What do you need money for?
- I'm going out.
I just need a little cash.

15
00:00:45,282 --> 00:00:46,480
Where you going?

16
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:50,971
I'm going to a fancy place with
some fancy new friends of mine.

17
00:00:50,971 --> 00:00:54,148
-What friends?
-What is happening?
Why is everyone
asking me questions?

18
00:00:54,148 --> 00:00:57,352
Well, it's 'cause you're
sneaking around trying
to steal money
that you haven't earned

19
00:00:57,352 --> 00:01:00,818
and looking like
Carmen Sandiego.
I mean, what-what
are we supposed to think?

20
00:01:00,818 --> 00:01:02,259
-W-What are you hiding, Dee?
-What?

21
00:01:02,259 --> 00:01:03,644
-Let me see
what's under that coat.
-No.

22
00:01:03,644 --> 00:01:05,005
-I want to see what's under it.
-No.

23
00:01:05,005 --> 00:01:06,771
-Show me.
-She's hiding something, Dennis.

24
00:01:06,771 --> 00:01:09,511
You want me to hold her down
and rip it off her?

25
00:01:10,484 --> 00:01:14,157
-Yeah.
-Stop it.
Stop. Stop it. Don't touch me.

26
00:01:14,157 --> 00:01:15,943
Don't touch me. Okay?

27
00:01:15,943 --> 00:01:20,192
I decided that I want
to take off the coat,

28
00:01:20,192 --> 00:01:23,566
'cause it's hot in here.

29
00:01:24,936 --> 00:01:27,865
Bowling? That's the fancy outing
you were, uh, hiding from us?

30
00:01:27,865 --> 00:01:29,456
Dee, why were you hiding
that from us?

31
00:01:29,456 --> 00:01:34,006
Because it's my thing, okay?
It's not your thing,
and I don't want
you guys getting involved.

32
00:01:34,349 --> 00:01:39,519
-As if.
-As if, Dee.
-As if.
-As if.
-As if, Dee. As if.

33
00:01:39,519 --> 00:01:42,467
Yeah, okay. All right.
Well, I'm gonna head out.

34
00:01:42,467 --> 00:01:46,752
You guys enjoy sitting around
with your ding-dongs in your
hand doing nothing all night.

35
00:01:49,032 --> 00:01:52,092
-Ding-dongs in our hand--
What is she talking--
What a bitch.
-Yeah.

36
00:01:52,092 --> 00:01:54,244
My ding-dong wasn't even in
my hand. I mean, what do you...

37
00:01:54,244 --> 00:01:55,803
-Mine was.
-Yeah, so was mine.

38
00:01:55,803 --> 00:01:57,403
Yeah, I was scratching mine
when she said that.

39
00:01:57,403 --> 00:02:00,335
I-I had my hands
fully down my pants,
if I'm being honest.

40
00:02:00,335 --> 00:02:01,832
I had to push it to the left.

41
00:02:01,832 --> 00:02:03,733
-They get itchy in there.
-That's a, such a coincidence.

42
00:02:03,733 --> 00:02:07,184
-That is a lucky guess.
-That's a crazy-- yeah.
-It was a lucky guess.
-It was a lucky guess.

43
00:02:07,184 --> 00:02:09,896
But that's not the point.
Look-look, the point is...

44
00:02:09,896 --> 00:02:13,366
...we have
a lot better things to do
than just go bowling.

45
00:02:13,366 --> 00:02:16,390
BOWLING

46
00:02:38,219 --> 00:02:41,111
Oh, hello, ladies.
You ready to roll?

47
00:02:41,111 --> 00:02:42,427
Why is everybody
sitting on their butts?

48
00:02:42,427 --> 00:02:44,425
We've been waiting here
for 20 minutes.

49
00:02:44,425 --> 00:02:49,825
Okay, well, listen,
things are just gonna be
a little different
if you want me on your team.
I show up when I want.

50
00:02:49,825 --> 00:02:52,709
Well, we don't want you
on our team.
It's just that our fourth
didn't show up

51
00:02:52,709 --> 00:02:55,047
and literally no one else
was free on a Friday night.

52
00:02:55,047 --> 00:02:56,002
-So you want me to be here.

53
00:02:56,002 --> 00:02:57,192
-Not really.
Awesome. Good.

54
00:02:57,192 --> 00:02:59,030
Do you have the $35 team fee?

55
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:03,417
-Ooh, I do not, but I have...
...something
much more valuable:

56
00:03:03,417 --> 00:03:04,485
my expertise.

57
00:03:04,485 --> 00:03:06,226
So listen to me
and you'll be in business.

58
00:03:06,226 --> 00:03:08,957
Anyone want to snort
Jell-O shots?

59
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:10,710
-Oh...
- Snail?
You're on the team?

60
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:14,418
Yeah, I love bowling.
The whole scene is so hot.

61
00:03:14,418 --> 00:03:18,049
I sucked off a rando
in the parking lot.
Ugh, my mouth hurts.

62
00:03:18,049 --> 00:03:20,633
Gross. Waitress,
you're responsible for this?

63
00:03:20,633 --> 00:03:23,216
I'm not responsible for this,
but this is my team, okay?

64
00:03:23,216 --> 00:03:27,533
So you can't just come in here
and take over,
come in late,
not have your money, okay?

65
00:03:27,533 --> 00:03:30,815
I signed us up, I booked
the lane, I made us shirts.

66
00:03:30,815 --> 00:03:35,288
I even found us an appliance
company to sponsor us.
Frige-it.

67
00:03:35,354 --> 00:03:37,141
-"Frige-it Bitches"?
- Yeah.

68
00:03:37,141 --> 00:03:39,171
-God, you guys are stupid.
I'm not wearing this.

69
00:03:39,171 --> 00:03:40,445
-No, it's so funny.
-It's not funny.

70
00:03:40,445 --> 00:03:42,701
-We've been laughing all night.
-That doesn't surprise me.

71
00:03:42,701 --> 00:03:45,936
Now listen up.
We're not here to laugh
or be funny.

72
00:03:45,936 --> 00:03:48,924
-We're here to win.
Which you can do
if you listen to me.

73
00:03:48,924 --> 00:03:52,480
Or perhaps I should let
my balls do the talking.

74
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,858
-Please do.
-Yeah.

75
00:04:02,803 --> 00:04:04,620
-Hot shit, Dee.

76
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:05,877
-Do I have your attention?

77
00:04:05,877 --> 00:04:08,852
- Well, well, well.
-Oh, God.
-What?

78
00:04:08,852 --> 00:04:12,098
Pretty nice roll, Deandra.
Too bad it'll be your last.

79
00:04:12,098 --> 00:04:15,796
- Can you please just leave and
let me have one thing to myself?
- Nah.

80
00:04:15,796 --> 00:04:19,659
So these, uh, "frigid bitches,"
these are your new
"fancy friends"?

81
00:04:19,659 --> 00:04:23,882
- What is this,
some kind of women's league?
- It's a coed tournament.

82
00:04:23,882 --> 00:04:28,311
- So you'll be
competing against men?
- Vaginas and penises
together again.

83
00:04:28,311 --> 00:04:32,505
I'll tell you what,
why don't we join this league
and have ourselves
a little competition?

84
00:04:32,505 --> 00:04:36,262
Or are y
ou too scared
that you'll lose to us?

85
00:04:39,073 --> 00:04:41,720
He did one, so I thought
we were doing... Okay.

86
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:42,697
Shit.

87
00:04:42,697 --> 00:04:43,916
Anyone got a straw?

88
00:04:43,916 --> 00:04:47,896
-I didn't know.
-Okay.
-It's fine. All right.
-Hey!
-Hey, guys?
-Let's have it.

89
00:04:47,973 --> 00:04:50,299
Oh, for Christ's sakes.
- Shit.
-Are you kidding me?

90
00:04:50,299 --> 00:04:52,658
-Please tell me
you guys don't own
this bowling alley.

91
00:04:52,658 --> 00:04:55,731
We got out
of the video rental business
just after the bubble burst.

92
00:04:55,731 --> 00:04:57,589
Bowling's always been
in our blood.

93
00:04:57,589 --> 00:05:01,312
Ryan's got the forearms
of an elephant wrangler.
He could have been pro.

94
00:05:01,312 --> 00:05:04,514
I could have been.
If not for my tragic accident.

95
00:05:04,514 --> 00:05:07,271
The story is too horrible
for words, so don't ask me...

96
00:05:07,271 --> 00:05:10,966
-We-we...
-We're not gonna ask.
We don't really care
-about that, yeah.
-You can keep that to yourself.

97
00:05:10,966 --> 00:05:13,107
I'd tell you, but you wouldn't
be able to handle it.

98
00:05:13,107 --> 00:05:15,810
-You clearly want to tell us,
but we're not here for it.
-We don't want to hear it.

99
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:18,694
Listen, I'm moving past this.
Can we sign up for the league?
-Impossible.

100
00:05:18,694 --> 00:05:23,095
-Why, is it too late to sign up?
- No, you just couldn't afford it.

101
00:05:23,095 --> 00:05:25,047
-How much is it?
-$35.

102
00:05:25,047 --> 00:05:26,765
-We got that.
-Well, we got that, yeah.
That's fine.

103
00:05:26,765 --> 00:05:28,282
Each.

104
00:05:28,948 --> 00:05:33,223
-Uh, do you mind covering us?
-That's still...
W-We're good, we're good, yeah.

105
00:05:33,223 --> 00:05:36,576
- Hey, listen, can we play
the Frigid Bitches first?
- Sure, whatever.
I don't give a shit.

106
00:05:36,576 --> 00:05:38,221
You guys got
chili cheese fries here?

107
00:05:38,221 --> 00:05:41,222
Franklin, we do have chili
and we do have cheese
and we do have fries,

108
00:05:41,222 --> 00:05:43,047
but combining them
is strictly prohibited.

109
00:05:43,047 --> 00:05:45,629
-Why?
-The story is too terrible
to tell.

110
00:05:45,629 --> 00:05:47,665
-Oh, for Christ's sake.
Nobody cares.
-Oh, Christ's sake.

111
00:05:47,665 --> 00:05:49,571
-Sign us up for the league.
-We won't combine the fries.

112
00:05:49,571 --> 00:05:51,081
Make sure we're playing
the Frigid Bitches.

113
00:05:51,081 --> 00:05:54,814
Yeah, give us some shoes.
W-What size shoe...
We'll get the shoes.

114
00:05:54,814 --> 00:05:58,449
Three, two, one and smile.

115
00:05:58,449 --> 00:06:01,216
-Great.
Let me check that picture.

116
00:06:01,216 --> 00:06:03,965
-How's my ass look?
- That looks pretty good.

117
00:06:03,965 --> 00:06:05,682
Oh, it looks huge. Sick.

118
00:06:05,682 --> 00:06:08,169
Can we take another? I wasn't
sufficiently in character.

119
00:06:08,169 --> 00:06:10,485
-In character?
-Yes, character.

120
00:06:10,485 --> 00:06:14,895
I'm researching
a character I'm playing
named Donna Brunswick of
the Brunswick Bowling Dynasty.

121
00:06:14,895 --> 00:06:17,458
Oh, goddamn. You guys are not
taking this seriously.

122
00:06:17,458 --> 00:06:20,613
Okay? Let's cut the BS.
As your leader,
I demand we cut the BS.

123
00:06:20,613 --> 00:06:25,746
Now let's talk order.
I'm thinking Snail, Artemis,
Waitress, best for last.

124
00:06:25,746 --> 00:06:30,144
- Okay,
I'm just gonna remind you
that you're not the leader
and you can't be the leader
'cause you don't even know
everyone's names.

125
00:06:30,144 --> 00:06:32,275
Mm, can you switch mine
to "Donna"?
-No.

126
00:06:32,275 --> 00:06:36,407
- Well, well, well.
Looks like
the Frigid Bitches are going up
against

127
00:06:36,407 --> 00:06:40,414
the Hanging Monster Dong
Lucky Strike
Chili Cheese Fryers.

128
00:06:40,414 --> 00:06:42,166
Is that your name?
That's really stupid.

129
00:06:42,166 --> 00:06:44,078
-It's too many ideas, man.
-I told you it was stupid.

130
00:06:44,078 --> 00:06:47,261
I-I knew they were gonna
make fun of us
and they did make fun of us.
-Yeah, 'cause it's stupid.

131
00:06:47,261 --> 00:06:50,484
You know what?
Uh, but it doesn't matter,
'cause you guys are dead meat.

132
00:06:50,484 --> 00:06:55,197
Hey, did Dee happen
to tell you the history
of her experience with bowling?

133
00:06:55,197 --> 00:06:57,708
-No.
-You should tell them,
you should tell them.

134
00:06:57,708 --> 00:07:00,880
-You tell them, you tell them.
-Tell them, tell them.
-I-I was about to.

135
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,669
-Oh, you were?
-I was about to. Yes.

136
00:07:02,915 --> 00:07:04,001
-He's gonna tell you.

137
00:07:04,001 --> 00:07:06,157
-Are we doing laughs?
-Yeah, uh, no.
I'll just tell it.

138
00:07:06,157 --> 00:07:10,421
-He's gonna tell you.
-Okay, well, when she was a kid,
she was, well,
she was pretty decent.

139
00:07:10,421 --> 00:07:13,284
And I got to say, she worked
really, really hard at it.

140
00:07:13,284 --> 00:07:18,344
So, she eventually became
the captain of the girls' team.
Can you believe that?

141
00:07:18,344 --> 00:07:22,102
Now, I'm no fan
of women's sports.
-Yeah, they're not very popular.

142
00:07:22,102 --> 00:07:26,518
Nobody watches--
Especially women.
Women don't even like
women's sports.
So I wouldn't have it.

143
00:07:26,518 --> 00:07:31,479
And to prove that Dee's
female mind was mentally weak,

144
00:07:31,479 --> 00:07:33,250
I started to go watch her,

145
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:38,278
and I would say, "gutter ball"
right before she rolled it,

146
00:07:38,278 --> 00:07:42,627
and wouldn't you know it,
every time I said it,

147
00:07:42,627 --> 00:07:46,131
she'd roll a gutter ball.

148
00:07:46,131 --> 00:07:50,063
Since then, if I even so much
as look at Dee when she bowls,

149
00:07:50,063 --> 00:07:52,699
she can't knock down
a single pin.

150
00:07:52,699 --> 00:07:57,495
Not even one.

151
00:07:57,912 --> 00:08:00,601
Well, that's
a bit of an exaggeration.

152
00:08:00,601 --> 00:08:03,229
Anyway, good luck out there.

153
00:08:03,472 --> 00:08:06,160
-Ladies.
-Gentlemen.

154
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:09,605
-That was so good. That was really good, Dennis.
-That was really good.

155
00:08:13,799 --> 00:08:17,468
All right, I'm looking
at their lineup,
and I'm wondering who should
lead us off against Snail.

156
00:08:17,468 --> 00:08:21,688
I'll start. It'll be good
to show our power and dominance,
you know, -for intimidation.

157
00:08:21,688 --> 00:08:24,090
-Uh, Frank?
You should go against Artemis.
She's next.

158
00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:26,202
Okay? And-and you should
go up after that,
'cause it's The Waitress,

159
00:08:26,202 --> 00:08:28,639
and you're gonna irritate
the shit out of her and
that-that's a good thing, okay?

160
00:08:28,724 --> 00:08:31,048
Oh, shit.
What?

161
00:08:31,144 --> 00:08:34,132
Some kid's having, like,
a birthday party in the arcade
or something.

162
00:08:34,132 --> 00:08:36,138
-Okay. So what?
-It looks fun.

163
00:08:36,138 --> 00:08:39,551
-Charlie, do not be that guy
that everyone's looking for
when it's their turn.

164
00:08:39,551 --> 00:08:41,983
That shit drives me crazy.
Please don't be that guy.

165
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:46,175
Okay, I'll go last against Dee
because it's gonna be
a lot of fun getting
in her head, so...

166
00:08:46,212 --> 00:08:48,093
It's gonna really mess her up.
It's gonna be awesome.

167
00:08:48,093 --> 00:08:50,199
All right. Hands in, boys.
Say it on three.

168
00:08:50,199 --> 00:08:55,557
- Hanging Monster Ch...
Chili Cheese Fryers!

169
00:08:57,933 --> 00:09:00,601
-Let's do it, bud.
Let's go, man.

170
00:09:00,601 --> 00:09:04,465
Stride, stride, stride, execute.

171
00:09:06,507 --> 00:09:09,912
-Okay, not bad, not bad, Mac.
-Not bad.
Not bad, dude.

172
00:09:09,912 --> 00:09:11,738
Come on, Snail.

173
00:09:11,738 --> 00:09:13,900
What the...
What? What?

174
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:16,214
Okay,
why are you so happy right now?

175
00:09:16,214 --> 00:09:19,815
- Gail. What the hell was that?
-Ooh, my cooter's
on fire for Mac.

176
00:09:19,815 --> 00:09:21,657
I want to have his baby.

177
00:09:21,657 --> 00:09:24,335
Your cooter is most likely
on fire from a yeast infection.

178
00:09:24,335 --> 00:09:26,551
Go in the bathroom, rinse it out
and be better next time.

179
00:09:26,551 --> 00:09:28,817
Dennis, cover me. Cover me.

180
00:09:28,817 --> 00:09:32,434
Ryan's eyeballing me
and I'm trying to mix these.

181
00:09:32,434 --> 00:09:35,324
-I can't do that right now.
-Go stand over here.

182
00:09:35,324 --> 00:09:37,637
I got Liam over here
eyeballing me.

183
00:09:37,637 --> 00:09:42,044
I mean, I...
I think he is. Little hard
to tell with the eyepatch.

184
00:09:42,044 --> 00:09:44,925
Ah. Anyway, it's your,
it's your roll, man.
Go, go, go. Go, yeah.

185
00:09:44,925 --> 00:09:47,140
-Oh. I'm up?
-Yes, you're up.
-Up.

186
00:09:49,207 --> 00:09:51,620
-Artemis.
-Frank.

187
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:57,116
How about we, uh,
test out the back seat
of my LeBaron after the roll?

188
00:09:57,116 --> 00:09:59,084
Everybody stop trying
to have sex with each other.

189
00:09:59,084 --> 00:10:03,517
Hey, you know,
another reason why
men and women
can't compete, Dee.
It's too sexually charged.

190
00:10:04,105 --> 00:10:06,567
Donna Brunswick...

191
00:10:10,757 --> 00:10:12,582
Strike.

192
00:10:13,911 --> 00:10:15,461
Nice.

193
00:10:15,461 --> 00:10:17,549
-Artemis, you can bowl?
-No.

194
00:10:17,549 --> 00:10:21,526
My character can.
Me, I can't bowl for shit.

195
00:10:32,026 --> 00:10:34,350
It's not gonna make it.

196
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:46,261
All right, Frank.
Good job, Frank.
All right, Frank.

197
00:10:46,261 --> 00:10:49,234
-What? Oh, bullshit.
No, come on, that doesn't count.

198
00:10:49,234 --> 00:10:51,112
Uh, no, the computer counted it,
so it counts.

199
00:10:51,112 --> 00:10:52,654
-Hey, Artemis, let's mush.

200
00:10:52,654 --> 00:10:55,322
What? No. No. You're not gonna
miss your turn, okay?

201
00:10:55,322 --> 00:10:56,710
If you must mush, mush later.

202
00:10:56,710 --> 00:10:59,058
- A quickie.
-Quickie it is.

203
00:10:59,058 --> 00:11:01,742
-What?
- My character is also
a giant whore,

204
00:11:01,742 --> 00:11:03,867
which is what
attracted me to the role
in the first place, so...

205
00:11:03,867 --> 00:11:07,638
-No. No, no.
- Come on,
you can't go now.
Well, mush fast!

206
00:11:11,946 --> 00:11:14,346
Hey, Tyrone,
do not take my spot!

207
00:11:14,346 --> 00:11:16,787
Do not take my spot
at the air hockey table.

208
00:11:16,787 --> 00:11:19,682
-Charlie, shut up.
-You should see the party
they got going there.

209
00:11:19,682 --> 00:11:22,780
-It's great.
They got one of those...
...punching machines
that rates how, like,
how much power
you have in your punch.

210
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:25,719
-I don't care.
Shut up, I'm trying to focus.
-It's totally crazy.
By the way,
your hair looks great.

211
00:11:25,719 --> 00:11:27,526
Charlie, shut up,
I'm trying to focus.

212
00:11:27,526 --> 00:11:29,728
-Did you, like,
change your hair or something?
-Oh, my God.

213
00:11:29,728 --> 00:11:32,774
Elbow in,
slight bend in the knee,

214
00:11:34,523 --> 00:11:37,318
Come on.

215
00:11:37,318 --> 00:11:40,364
All right. I'm coming!
-Charlie, Charlie,
where you going?
-Where you going?

216
00:11:40,364 --> 00:11:42,859
-Put the cake down...
-I'll be back.

217
00:11:44,033 --> 00:11:47,052
-Dee, you want to go first?
-Don't... Stop it. I know what you're doing.

218
00:11:47,052 --> 00:11:49,883
-I'm not gonna say anything.
I swear to God.
Please, I insist.

219
00:11:49,883 --> 00:11:51,422
I'm not.

220
00:11:51,515 --> 00:11:54,719
-Fine.
-All right. Come on, Dee.

221
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:57,293
Gutter ball.

222
00:11:57,293 --> 00:11:59,031
You-you dick.

223
00:11:59,031 --> 00:12:01,270
-Sorry. I'm sorry.
-That's not funny.

224
00:12:01,357 --> 00:12:04,157
I couldn't resist.
It's... Sorry.

225
00:12:12,404 --> 00:12:16,866
Don't say it again.
Okay? Just leave me alone.
-I'm not. I just... I'm not.

226
00:12:17,346 --> 00:12:18,615
Gutter ball.

227
00:12:18,615 --> 00:12:21,747
You goddamned son of a bitch!

228
00:12:22,111 --> 00:12:25,468
How are you gonna talk to me
about form
after you bowl like that?

229
00:12:25,468 --> 00:12:26,854
-Get off my back,
you frigid bitch.

230
00:12:26,854 --> 00:12:30,723
- I knew inviting you
was a bad idea.
- Well, then, don't invite me.
Then don't invite me next time.

231
00:12:30,723 --> 00:12:32,189
-I didn't invite...

232
00:12:32,189 --> 00:12:34,316
Oh, isn't this fun?

233
00:12:34,316 --> 00:12:37,876
Yeah. Yet another reason why
women can't compete with men.

234
00:12:37,876 --> 00:12:39,814
Besides your
physical limitations,

235
00:12:39,814 --> 00:12:44,873
if given the opportunity
to either work together
as a team
or tear each other apart,

236
00:12:44,873 --> 00:12:46,945
you will always choose
the latter.

237
00:12:46,945 --> 00:12:51,746
Because women are devious
a-and destructive

238
00:12:51,814 --> 00:12:57,806
and will always default
to using their insidious venom
on the most sought-after
victim of all...

239
00:12:57,806 --> 00:13:00,134
...each other.

240
00:13:04,177 --> 00:13:06,391
Okay, Dennis is right.
Just hear me out.

241
00:13:06,391 --> 00:13:08,729
If we want to win,
we can't compete like men,

242
00:13:08,729 --> 00:13:13,540
but what we can do
is use those skills
of mental manipulation
against them.

243
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:15,861
Do you want to know why?
Why?

244
00:13:15,861 --> 00:13:20,248
Because... they're stupid.

245
00:13:21,975 --> 00:13:25,076
Hey,
Mac, how come
you throw the ball so straight?

246
00:13:25,076 --> 00:13:29,807
I throw the ball straight
because, as a man,
dominance is my sporting style.

247
00:13:29,874 --> 00:13:34,460
Uh, I heard it's 'cause
you have no finesse.
You don't know
how to spin the ball.

248
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:36,642
-What?
I have finesse.
I could spin the ball.

249
00:13:36,642 --> 00:13:37,754
-You want to see me?
-Yeah.

250
00:13:37,754 --> 00:13:41,678
-Hey, uh, Mac? Mac?
Can I talk to you for a second?
- Yeah.

251
00:13:41,678 --> 00:13:43,718
Do not try and spin the ball.

252
00:13:43,718 --> 00:13:46,958
She said that I can't spin,
and I can spin.
-You-- Do not try it.

253
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:49,672
-But Dennis, she said
I have no finesse,
and you know
that I have finesse.

254
00:13:49,672 --> 00:13:52,578
-Don't do it.
Just play your game.
-Can I just spin one?
-I don't care...
-Let me spin one.
You don't need to spin it.

255
00:13:52,578 --> 00:13:54,500
You just play your game
and we're gonna win.

256
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:57,851
Okay? Do not spin it.
Do not do it.

257
00:13:59,563 --> 00:14:03,114
Okay, fine.
I won't, I won't spin it.

258
00:14:03,114 --> 00:14:04,950
I won't.

259
00:14:07,775 --> 00:14:11,415
Stride, stride, stride, spin!

260
00:14:11,415 --> 00:14:12,797
Oh, goddamn it!

261
00:14:12,797 --> 00:14:15,534
Gutter ball.
- I'm gonna try it again.

262
00:14:15,534 --> 00:14:17,648
-I'm coming,
I'm coming.
Wait, I'm coming, I'm coming.

263
00:14:17,648 --> 00:14:22,305
Hey, Tyrone, double or nothing!
'Cause there's no way
you're beating me
two out of three, dude!

264
00:14:22,305 --> 00:14:25,915
-Hey, Charlie? Excuse me.
Can I, can I ask your advice
on something?
-Yeah.

265
00:14:25,915 --> 00:14:28,742
-Well, you're just such
a good natural bowler...
...and I'm having a hard time,

266
00:14:28,742 --> 00:14:31,261
so I was wondering,
where are you putting your elbow
when you're rolling?

267
00:14:31,322 --> 00:14:34,260
-My elbow?
- Yeah, before you throw the ball,
where is your elbow going?

268
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:36,963
You-you want me to show you
where my elbow goes?
-Yeah.

269
00:14:37,671 --> 00:14:40,211
-My-my elbow's like...
-Uh-huh.

270
00:14:40,443 --> 00:14:42,306
That looks good.

271
00:14:44,517 --> 00:14:46,957
Gutter ball.

272
00:14:46,957 --> 00:14:49,789
Holy shit. It's working.

273
00:14:53,006 --> 00:14:56,977
-There we go.
-Okay.
Okay. It's okay.

274
00:14:56,977 --> 00:14:57,877
Damn it!

275
00:14:57,877 --> 00:14:59,666
-Just walk.
-What are you doing?

276
00:14:59,666 --> 00:15:02,497
Stride, stride, stride, spin!
Come on!

277
00:15:02,497 --> 00:15:05,149
-Gutter ball.
-S-Stop it.

278
00:15:05,149 --> 00:15:13,504
Gutter ball.

279
00:15:23,145 --> 00:15:24,781
You want one?

280
00:15:36,098 --> 00:15:38,707
-What happened?
What the hell happened?

281
00:15:38,707 --> 00:15:40,634
In the third act of my play,
Donna rolls a gutter ball

282
00:15:40,668 --> 00:15:43,902
in the big match
against her rival high school.

283
00:15:43,902 --> 00:15:45,516
-Are you serious?
-Oh, my God.

284
00:15:45,516 --> 00:15:47,932
Can you knock it off
with the play, please?

285
00:15:53,261 --> 00:15:56,982
Ah, well, well,
you done good, ladies.

286
00:15:56,982 --> 00:15:59,538
Your little mind games,
they got you pretty far,

287
00:15:59,538 --> 00:16:05,000
but unfortunately...
...still 11 points shy
in the final frame.

288
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,773
Now, technically,
I could pick up this spare
and push the lead
even further,

289
00:16:08,773 --> 00:16:12,028
and I...
think we all know Dee's about
to roll two gutter balls.

290
00:16:12,028 --> 00:16:16,696
So I'll tell you what.
Dee, if you would like,
uh, you could just quit now

291
00:16:16,696 --> 00:16:21,228
and you could all admit
that you're inferior
in every single way,

292
00:16:21,228 --> 00:16:22,655
and we could just call it
a night.

293
00:16:22,655 --> 00:16:27,364
Okay, you know what, dick?
I don't like your sister.
She's a terrible person.

294
00:16:27,364 --> 00:16:30,477
-She's a bitch and she's ugly
and I didn't want her
on the team.

295
00:16:30,477 --> 00:16:33,199
- And she's gross.
- Sure, and she's gross.

296
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:35,328
But you know what?
You're even worse.

297
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:38,764
And I am not gonna sit here
and let you just shit on her
all night long.

298
00:16:38,764 --> 00:16:42,151
You think
you're physically superior?
-Yeah.

299
00:16:42,151 --> 00:16:45,127
-Then I challenge you
to a test of strength.

300
00:16:46,245 --> 00:16:49,533
- This isn't fair.
- Oh. Is it not fair?

301
00:16:49,533 --> 00:16:51,543
Okay, well, if you're scared,
we don't have to do it.

302
00:16:51,543 --> 00:16:53,944
Okay, well, listen,
if you insist, that's fine.

303
00:16:53,944 --> 00:16:55,397
-I do. Okay.
-Let's do it. Yeah.

304
00:16:55,397 --> 00:16:57,456
Ladies first.
-All right, let's do it.
-Oh, thank you.

305
00:16:57,456 --> 00:17:01,733
Go, Waitress, go.
Give it all you got.

306
00:17:05,928 --> 00:17:09,966
- Shit. Didn't know you could kick it.
-Oh, yeah, you could kick it.

307
00:17:09,966 --> 00:17:11,776
-And that's fine. Okay.
-Yeah, yeah, okay. Do it.

308
00:17:11,852 --> 00:17:16,201
Show them what you got, Dennis.
Come on.
Let's go, buddy.

309
00:17:16,339 --> 00:17:20,735
I summon the very fact
that I am a man!

310
00:17:29,842 --> 00:17:32,497
I have defeated you.
And of course I have.

311
00:17:32,497 --> 00:17:36,250
I've been blessed
with the genetic gifts to do so.

312
00:17:39,498 --> 00:17:43,384
I've broken
every single bone in my hand.
I cannot bowl.

313
00:17:43,384 --> 00:17:46,345
-What?
-Really?
-L-Listen to me.
There's nothing solid
left in there.

314
00:17:46,345 --> 00:17:48,915
It's just bloody soup
and bone broth.

315
00:17:48,915 --> 00:17:53,501
All right?
Now, I need to scream.
And I need you to find me
somewhere to scream
so I don't have to do it here.

316
00:17:53,501 --> 00:17:57,277
No, wait a minute.
I'm going to scream here,
and now,

317
00:17:57,277 --> 00:17:59,855
'cause I can't hold it in,
so here we go.

318
00:18:05,726 --> 00:18:09,995
- Ryan, I need you to bowl for me.
- I'll never bowl again.

319
00:18:09,995 --> 00:18:11,660
-Come on, man.
-Why not? What's the big deal?

320
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:14,525
The story's
too horrible to tell.

321
00:18:14,525 --> 00:18:17,872
-For fuck's sake,
just spit it out.
- Yeah, you clearly want
to tell it, man.

322
00:18:17,872 --> 00:18:21,275
Fine.
But brace yourself.

323
00:18:21,592 --> 00:18:25,757
There I was,
practicing for
the state semifinals.

324
00:18:27,979 --> 00:18:31,223
I was on my way
to a perfect game.

325
00:18:34,557 --> 00:18:39,491
I was enjoying
some chili cheese fries.
They were delicious,
and I offered some to Ryan.

326
00:18:39,491 --> 00:18:44,082
I accepted, but not realizing
my other hand was
in the ball return lane.

327
00:18:44,082 --> 00:18:46,292
I never should have allowed
myself such indulgences,

328
00:18:46,292 --> 00:18:50,405
because little did I know,
my ball was returning.

329
00:18:57,370 --> 00:19:01,890
It pinched it really bad.
I had a nasty bruise for a week.

330
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:03,399
-That's it?
-That's why you won't bowl?

331
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,651
-You pinched your finger?
-You pinched your finger
-and you won't bowl?
-Big deal, man.

332
00:19:05,651 --> 00:19:07,630
I'll bowl for you... Dennis.

333
00:19:07,630 --> 00:19:11,235
-Okay, fine.
-Okay.
-Wait, what's happening?
What-what are you saying? What?

334
00:19:11,637 --> 00:19:12,889
-Nothing.
-What?

335
00:19:12,889 --> 00:19:14,612
-N-Nothing.
-What's going on?

336
00:19:14,612 --> 00:19:18,184
Liam's gonna bowl for me
because I hurt my hand
a little bit.

337
00:19:20,333 --> 00:19:22,554
Ow, I just,
I just twisted my ankle.

338
00:19:22,554 --> 00:19:25,005
-No.
-Yeah, and I need Ryan,
I need Ryan to bowl for me.

339
00:19:25,005 --> 00:19:28,066
-No way. No way.
-My ankle is hurt,
and I need Ryan to bowl for me.

340
00:19:28,066 --> 00:19:30,001
-That...
-That is bullshit.

341
00:19:32,998 --> 00:19:36,153
This is incredibly weird.

342
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:57,380
Ryan!

343
00:19:57,380 --> 00:20:01,325
Brother!
Brother, what have I done?

344
00:20:14,262 --> 00:20:17,721
Well, well, well, Dee,
it looks like
you're gonna have
to roll after all.

345
00:20:17,721 --> 00:20:20,032
Fine. No problem.

346
00:20:20,032 --> 00:20:22,214
Gonna make my team proud.

347
00:20:22,214 --> 00:20:23,864
Oh, well, maybe you will.

348
00:20:23,864 --> 00:20:28,050
Or maybe...
you'll roll a gutter ball.

349
00:20:32,544 --> 00:20:36,882
One pin. That's all.
You can do this.

350
00:20:36,882 --> 00:20:39,757
-Gutter ball.
-No. No.

351
00:20:39,757 --> 00:20:42,630
Just don't think "gutter ball,"
that's all.

352
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:47,284
Oh, hi, Dee.
I'm in here, too.

353
00:20:47,284 --> 00:20:49,845
Gutter ball.

354
00:20:50,778 --> 00:20:56,211
-Gutter ball. Gutter ball.
-Gutter ball. Gutter ball.

355
00:20:56,211 --> 00:21:00,946
You goddamned son of a--
bitch!

356
00:21:23,359 --> 00:21:28,502
-No, no, no...
-No, no...
No, no, no, no...

357
00:21:33,328 --> 00:21:36,982
I did it! In your faces.

358
00:21:37,434 --> 00:21:39,614
Ha... Uh... What's going on?
Where'd everybody go?

359
00:21:39,614 --> 00:21:43,226
-Frank's having a threesome
in the bathroom
with Gail and Artemis,

360
00:21:43,226 --> 00:21:46,042
and, um, yeah, I think the guys
went to the Sixers game.

361
00:21:46,042 --> 00:21:50,029
What?
Oh, goddamn it.

362
00:21:50,324 --> 00:21:52,446
Well, why aren't you
celebrating?

363
00:21:52,446 --> 00:21:55,336
yeah, honestly?

364
00:21:55,336 --> 00:21:58,833
I don't give a shit
about women's sports.

365
00:22:00,771 --> 00:22:20,834
translate
