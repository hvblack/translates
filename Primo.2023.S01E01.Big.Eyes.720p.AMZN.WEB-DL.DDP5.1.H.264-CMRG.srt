1
00:00:10,092 --> 00:00:11,198
Cool picture

2
00:00:11,198 --> 00:00:15,485
Finger

3
00:00:16,883 --> 00:00:18,425
Serious

4
00:00:18,425 --> 00:00:19,461
Nope

5
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:22,330
Cooking

6
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:23,584
Yeah

7
00:00:23,584 --> 00:00:25,557
Come

8
00:00:27,041 --> 00:00:29,726
Uncles

9
00:00:29,726 --> 00:00:31,524
Check

10
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:46,756
You're being ridiculous.

11
00:00:46,839 --> 00:00:48,591
What's ridiculous
is your narrow view of the world.

12
00:00:48,674 --> 00:00:50,718
Hurry up and get some food
before your uncles eat it all.

13
00:00:50,801 --> 00:00:52,136
All right, Ma.
I just gotta go to the bathroom.

14
00:00:52,219 --> 00:00:53,179
Hey, what's up, Primo?

15
00:00:53,262 --> 00:00:54,388
What? Uncle Rollie.

16
00:00:54,472 --> 00:00:56,390
- Oh, come on.
-  Too slow.

17
00:00:56,474 --> 00:00:58,142
What are you talking about too slow?

18
00:00:58,225 --> 00:01:00,519
- I was here first.
-  Too fast then.

19
00:01:01,645 --> 00:01:04,148
- Too fast?
-  You can't wisdom your way
out of this one.

20
00:01:04,231 --> 00:01:05,858
Primo. Perfect.

21
00:01:05,941 --> 00:01:08,569
How tall can a person be
before you think he's dumb?

22
00:01:08,652 --> 00:01:10,070
- What?
- If you're looking at a person,

23
00:01:10,154 --> 00:01:11,530
let's say it's a guy,

24
00:01:11,614 --> 00:01:13,282
how tall can that guy be

25
00:01:13,365 --> 00:01:15,326
- before you think he's dumb?
- You've got it backward.

26
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:17,369
The taller a person is,
the smarter they are.

27
00:01:17,453 --> 00:01:20,080
The brain has already expended
all of its energy on making you tall

28
00:01:20,164 --> 00:01:21,624
and now it can work on other things.

29
00:01:21,707 --> 00:01:23,959
When things get more advanced,
they do not get bigger,

30
00:01:24,043 --> 00:01:25,085
they get smaller.

31
00:01:25,169 --> 00:01:27,004
Computers, cameras, phones.

32
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:30,132
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar,
Abe Lincoln, Queen Latifah.

33
00:01:30,216 --> 00:01:31,509
- Are there any eggs left?
- No.

34
00:01:31,592 --> 00:01:32,843
Awesome.

35
00:01:32,927 --> 00:01:34,470
Hey, what happened
with that girl you like?

36
00:01:34,553 --> 00:01:36,222
Hey, whose advice did you take?

37
00:01:36,305 --> 00:01:38,808
Well, I had a lot of really good options.

38
00:01:38,891 --> 00:01:41,769
The way you connect with someone
is through communal crying.

39
00:01:41,852 --> 00:01:44,522
The two of you stare
into each other's eyes and cry together.

40
00:01:44,605 --> 00:01:47,316
No words, just tears.

41
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:48,901
Primo, forget all that.

42
00:01:48,984 --> 00:01:51,821
See, what you wanna do
is find someone she hates, right,

43
00:01:51,904 --> 00:01:54,114
then punch him in the mouth
right in front of her.

44
00:01:54,198 --> 00:01:55,866
Prove that you can protect her.

45
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:57,409
- That's not terrible.
- It isn't?

46
00:01:57,493 --> 00:01:59,328
No, but it's more about
proving how strong you are.

47
00:01:59,411 --> 00:02:00,788
Find a reason to pick her up.

48
00:02:00,871 --> 00:02:03,707
Just right off the ground,
like the Stanley Cup.

49
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,336
I think that's where they get
the term trophy wife.

50
00:02:08,003 --> 00:02:10,297
I think I'm gonna go about it my own way.

51
00:02:10,381 --> 00:02:12,550
Just be super weird in front of her
and never do anything?

52
00:02:12,633 --> 00:02:15,010
- Correct.
- Nice. Good job.

53
00:02:15,636 --> 00:02:16,846
What are you watching?

54
00:02:16,929 --> 00:02:20,266
It's a supercut of all the cocaine scenes
from Wolf of Wall Street.

55
00:02:20,349 --> 00:02:21,725
It ends up being the whole movie.

56
00:02:21,809 --> 00:02:24,270
I thought Ma said
no  Wolf of Wall Street  before 8:00 A.M.?

57
00:02:25,437 --> 00:02:27,898
Wolves don't follow rules.

58
00:02:27,982 --> 00:02:29,692
- Turn it off, Ryan.
- You got it.

59
00:02:29,775 --> 00:02:31,569
Primo, sit down. Let me ask you something.

60
00:02:31,652 --> 00:02:34,071
How many of your teachers
would you say are...

61
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:36,240
satisfied with their
current banking situations?

62
00:02:36,323 --> 00:02:38,033
Why would I know that, Uncle Ryan?

63
00:02:38,117 --> 00:02:40,661
All right. Do me a favor.
Leave these on your teachers' desks

64
00:02:40,744 --> 00:02:43,080
and tell them that I will personally
take care of them.

65
00:02:43,706 --> 00:02:45,040
Did you staple these?

66
00:02:45,124 --> 00:02:47,835
You got a better way to attach
business cards to apples?

67
00:02:47,918 --> 00:02:49,044
Tape.

68
00:02:49,128 --> 00:02:50,296
Damn it.

69
00:02:50,379 --> 00:02:52,548
I made 40 business apples.

70
00:02:53,674 --> 00:02:55,634
Ernesto is sick.
We're a man short

71
00:02:55,718 --> 00:02:57,970
and I got four irrigation systems
to install.

72
00:02:58,053 --> 00:02:59,096
Which one of you all
is coming with me today?

73
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:00,014
- Not me.
-  No, no, no, no.

74
00:03:00,097 --> 00:03:01,599
Take them all.
Get everybody out of my house.

75
00:03:01,682 --> 00:03:02,683
Rafa, breakfast.

76
00:03:02,766 --> 00:03:04,476
Okay. I'm leaving. Bye.

77
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,862
All right. Too slow for real this time.
- Are you kidding me?

78
00:03:06,862 --> 00:03:08,981
-  Let's go, guys.
We don't have all day.

79
00:03:09,064 --> 00:03:11,317
- Guys, you heard him.
- And, you, put some shoes on.

80
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:15,154
- And why are you wearing a fleece?
It's like a hundred degrees outside.

81
00:03:15,237 --> 00:03:16,697
I got a job. But you know that already.

82
00:03:19,978 --> 00:03:22,317
All uncles

83
00:03:23,272 --> 00:03:25,213
Nvm

84
00:03:33,429 --> 00:03:35,461
Big eyes
End of August

85
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:39,303
Before you start, Mr. Flores,
can I just say that

86
00:03:39,386 --> 00:03:40,804
whatever you think that I did,
I didn't do it.

87
00:03:40,888 --> 00:03:43,891
And if I did do it, then I didn't mean to.

88
00:03:43,974 --> 00:03:48,187
And if I did mean to,
then I didn't know that it was wrong.

89
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:50,689
Also, are you happy
with your current banking situation?

90
00:03:50,773 --> 00:03:54,401
I have a business apple.
Just careful of the staple.

91
00:03:56,737 --> 00:04:00,532
Mr. Gonzalez... where do you think
you might wanna go to college?

92
00:04:00,616 --> 00:04:02,284
- I'm sorry?
- College.

93
00:04:02,368 --> 00:04:04,244
Surely, you've thought about it.
I know I have.

94
00:04:04,328 --> 00:04:06,121
You haven't gone to college yet?

95
00:04:06,205 --> 00:04:07,164
I meant for you.

96
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:08,749
There's a college prep program here

97
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:11,585
that helps our juniors and seniors
prepare for the admission process.

98
00:04:11,669 --> 00:04:16,674
Oh. Yeah, I don't think that's for me.
I'm probably not right for college.

99
00:04:16,757 --> 00:04:17,925
What does that mean?

100
00:04:18,008 --> 00:04:21,136
I mean, college is for kids
who do boat sports.

101
00:04:25,432 --> 00:04:26,517
Do you know what that is?

102
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:30,521
No, but it's definitely good news.
There's a lot of green here.

103
00:04:31,355 --> 00:04:33,607
If you get a thing from a teacher

104
00:04:33,691 --> 00:04:36,527
and it has a green on it,
it's usually good.

105
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:40,406
Red is almost always bad.
Red cards in soccer,

106
00:04:40,489 --> 00:04:44,076
the-the buzzer in  Family Feud,
Red Wedding in  Game of Thrones.

107
00:04:45,119 --> 00:04:49,164
Sorry. I'm kind of nervous.
You talk now.

108
00:04:49,248 --> 00:04:51,333
Those are the results
from the standardized tests

109
00:04:51,417 --> 00:04:54,086
you and your classmates took
at the end of sophomore year.

110
00:04:54,169 --> 00:04:58,257
You scored in the 93rd percentile.
You scored higher than 93%

111
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:00,634
of all the other sophomores
in the state of Texas.

112
00:05:00,718 --> 00:05:02,344
You're telling me you're not right
for college.

113
00:05:02,428 --> 00:05:04,680
I'm telling you
you're exactly right for college.

114
00:05:06,098 --> 00:05:07,599
Here's an application.

115
00:05:08,684 --> 00:05:11,186
I think you should apply to the program.

116
00:05:13,147 --> 00:05:15,983
Oh, no. What does blue mean?

117
00:05:16,066 --> 00:05:17,943
Yo, you're a genius.

118
00:05:18,027 --> 00:05:20,738
It's not a big deal.
It's just one test.

119
00:05:20,821 --> 00:05:22,322
But now the guidance counselor

120
00:05:22,406 --> 00:05:24,867
wants me to apply
to this college prep program.

121
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:26,201
Did you all know anything about that?

122
00:05:26,285 --> 00:05:28,662
I honestly didn't even know
we had a guidance counselor,

123
00:05:28,746 --> 00:05:31,206
so, no, I did not know about
the college prep program.

124
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:33,542
I've been in a college prep program
since I was born.

125
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:35,961
Both my parents went to Howard.
Their parents went to Howard.

126
00:05:36,045 --> 00:05:37,129
So guess where I'm going?

127
00:05:37,212 --> 00:05:39,465
I'm sorry. Who's Howard?
I wasn't really listening.

128
00:05:39,548 --> 00:05:41,425
I'm trying to figure out
if I could rock a bucket hat?

129
00:05:41,508 --> 00:05:43,343
College. We're talking about college.

130
00:05:43,427 --> 00:05:44,344
I don't need college.

131
00:05:44,428 --> 00:05:47,681
I'm gonna inherit my parents' store
and be the Filipino Godfather.

132
00:05:47,765 --> 00:05:50,601
See? That sounds good.
I need a plan like that.

133
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:55,355
You know, I could work for my Uncle Jay,
maybe become the Irrigation Scarface.

134
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:57,024
Oh, is that what you wanna do?

135
00:05:57,107 --> 00:05:59,526
Oh, I have no idea what I wanna do.
I thought that was obvious.

136
00:06:01,278 --> 00:06:03,113
You all give me a minute.
I'mma say what's up to my mom?

137
00:06:03,197 --> 00:06:04,281
All right.

138
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,784
-  Looks better if you had red...
- Hey, Ma.

139
00:06:06,867 --> 00:06:07,868
Oh, get out of here. Go.

140
00:06:07,951 --> 00:06:09,787
Oh, hi. Hi.

141
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:11,330
Who's that? Do I know him?

142
00:06:11,413 --> 00:06:13,373
Uh, he works at the tire shop?

143
00:06:13,457 --> 00:06:15,250
- What's in the box?
- Oh, this?

144
00:06:15,334 --> 00:06:17,544
This is a beautiful, handmade,

145
00:06:17,628 --> 00:06:19,797
one-of-a-kind
none of your goddamn business.

146
00:06:20,923 --> 00:06:25,385
Oh, is, is that our new neighbor, Mya?
Bring her in so I can meet her.

147
00:06:25,469 --> 00:06:28,305
No, no, I can't. I gotta go.
We'll be at Harris' house though, okay?

148
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:29,932
- Bye.
- I need you home by 7:00.

149
00:06:30,015 --> 00:06:33,185
What? No, no, no, no, no.
I was hoping I could hang out at Harris'.

150
00:06:34,478 --> 00:06:36,605
I was hoping I could be home by 7:00.

151
00:06:36,688 --> 00:06:37,815
Perfect.

152
00:06:51,286 --> 00:06:52,996
- Mike, here. This is your job.
-  Hmm.

153
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:55,040
Write, "Congratulations, Rafa"
on the cake.

154
00:06:55,124 --> 00:06:57,000
- What's the other bag for?
- Oh, hell, yeah.

155
00:06:57,084 --> 00:06:58,293
Cake icing.

156
00:06:58,377 --> 00:07:00,546
- It's gonna turn your teeth blue.

157
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:03,465
Okay. I need to talk to you guys
about something.

158
00:07:03,549 --> 00:07:06,051
Rafa's guidance counselor called me
a few weeks ago

159
00:07:06,135 --> 00:07:09,930
and said that Rafa scored really high
on some test

160
00:07:10,013 --> 00:07:11,849
and he thinks Rafa has a good chance

161
00:07:11,932 --> 00:07:13,851
of getting into college
after he graduates.

162
00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:15,936
Rafa hasn't said anything to me
about it yet

163
00:07:16,019 --> 00:07:18,188
but I know that he met with him today.

164
00:07:18,272 --> 00:07:20,941
College is a scam.
He should be working.

165
00:07:21,024 --> 00:07:23,735
He's 16 now. He'll be 17
by the end of the school year.

166
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:25,070
Soon he'll be 18.

167
00:07:25,154 --> 00:07:27,739
Hey, Jay's right.
That is how numbers work.

168
00:07:27,823 --> 00:07:31,410
If he starts working for me now,
he'll be ready to run his own crew

169
00:07:31,493 --> 00:07:33,036
by the time he graduates high school.

170
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,122
What if he doesn't wanna dig holes
for a living?

171
00:07:35,205 --> 00:07:37,666
Maybe he wants to work in finance like me.

172
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:38,917
You're a bank teller.

173
00:07:39,001 --> 00:07:42,796
You son of a bitch.
If you would've read the apple,

174
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,965
you would've known
that I am an account manager now.

175
00:07:45,048 --> 00:07:46,717
- I read the apple.
- Thank you.

176
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,512
Okay.
This is exactly what I'm talking about.

177
00:07:50,596 --> 00:07:53,765
I don't need you all in his ear about this
like you are about everything else.

178
00:07:53,849 --> 00:07:59,146
So, nobody says a word to him about it.
Not a word. Leave him be.

179
00:08:04,818 --> 00:08:08,071
Jay, after Rafa turns 18,
what age does he turn next?

180
00:08:10,782 --> 00:08:12,492
Well, thanks for walking me home.

181
00:08:12,576 --> 00:08:13,869
I still don't really know my way
around here

182
00:08:13,952 --> 00:08:15,996
and there's a lot of stray dogs
in this neighborhood.

183
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:18,457
No, of course. It's no problem.

184
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:21,418
- But honestly, if any of the dogs come...
- Mm-hmm.

185
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:23,712
- ...you're on your own.
-  Whatever.

186
00:08:23,795 --> 00:08:26,048
Hey, you still applying
to that college thing?

187
00:08:26,924 --> 00:08:28,300
Part of me wants to.

188
00:08:28,884 --> 00:08:31,178
No one in my family has ever been
to like a real college before.

189
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,889
My mom would freak.

190
00:08:33,972 --> 00:08:36,600
- She'd be so happy.

191
00:08:36,683 --> 00:08:39,311
But who knows
what all my uncles would say?

192
00:08:39,394 --> 00:08:41,647
All your uncles? How many uncles you got?

193
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:43,148
- Five.
- Oh.

194
00:08:43,232 --> 00:08:46,026
It feels like 50 most of the time though.

195
00:08:46,109 --> 00:08:49,112
My dad left when I was little,
so they're always around

196
00:08:49,196 --> 00:08:50,989
and they're super protective
of my mom and me.

197
00:08:51,073 --> 00:08:52,574
Yeah. What's that like?

198
00:08:52,658 --> 00:08:55,244
Mostly it's like being
inside a cloud of bees...

199
00:08:55,327 --> 00:08:59,331
- Mm-hmm.
- ...except the bees are always
like cussing and punching at each other.

200
00:08:59,414 --> 00:09:00,874
Okay.

201
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:04,169
Uh, you wanna come
and wait at the front porch?

202
00:09:04,253 --> 00:09:05,754
I'll go inside and get
those history notes for you.

203
00:09:05,837 --> 00:09:06,922
Yeah. Sure.

204
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:16,306
Surprise!

205
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:19,518
Mya, you're here? Come in.

206
00:09:21,353 --> 00:09:23,480
Does that sign say you're a junior?

207
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:26,233
Yeah. It's just what my mom does.

208
00:09:26,316 --> 00:09:29,861
Any time I do a thing that she's proud of,
she throws me a party.

209
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:32,393
Football

210
00:09:32,393 --> 00:09:33,962
Vision

211
00:09:33,962 --> 00:09:36,772
Shaved

212
00:09:36,772 --> 00:09:39,988
Quit

213
00:09:39,988 --> 00:09:43,041
I'm an only child.
It's kind of embarrassing.

214
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:48,046
I don't know. It seems really nice.
I won the 1600 at a track meet last year

215
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:50,382
and my father just said,
"You performed adequately."

216
00:09:50,465 --> 00:09:54,094
It's so nice to meet you, Mya.
I'm Andrea, Rafa's mom.

217
00:09:54,177 --> 00:09:56,013
- Welcome to the neighborhood.
- Thank you.

218
00:09:56,096 --> 00:09:57,806
Okay. Everybody, gather around.

219
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,643
First of all, we just wanna say
how proud we are of you, Rafa.

220
00:10:01,727 --> 00:10:04,104
I cannot believe that you're a junior.

221
00:10:04,187 --> 00:10:06,648
-  My baby!

222
00:10:06,732 --> 00:10:08,400
This is for you.

223
00:10:08,483 --> 00:10:10,485
- What's this?
- It's a present.

224
00:10:10,569 --> 00:10:12,654
I knew that. I was asking what's inside?

225
00:10:12,738 --> 00:10:14,364
Do you not know how presents work?

226
00:10:14,448 --> 00:10:16,366
- Right.

227
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:17,951
- Okay.
-  Okay. Open it!

228
00:10:18,035 --> 00:10:23,582
- Yes. Come on.
-  Open it!
Open it! Open it!
Open it! Open it!

229
00:10:25,417 --> 00:10:27,252
-  Okay. Try it on.
- What?

230
00:10:31,757 --> 00:10:32,883
Oh, thanks.

231
00:10:32,966 --> 00:10:35,635
I just figured that you
might need something nice

232
00:10:35,719 --> 00:10:38,513
for, you know, future occasions.

233
00:10:38,597 --> 00:10:39,765
Like court.

234
00:10:46,355 --> 00:10:49,107
...I actually have an announcement
to make too.

235
00:10:49,191 --> 00:10:51,151
I met with my guidance counselor today

236
00:10:51,234 --> 00:10:53,236
and he thinks that I have a shot
at going to college.

237
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,488
- What?

238
00:10:54,571 --> 00:10:56,031
My boy.

239
00:10:56,114 --> 00:10:58,200
That's-that's great, baby.

240
00:10:58,283 --> 00:11:00,285
College is a scam. Don't be stupid.

241
00:11:00,369 --> 00:11:02,120
- Not the time, Jay.
- No, he's right.

242
00:11:02,204 --> 00:11:05,332
It's just four years of expensive nonsense
where the system tells you how to think.

243
00:11:05,415 --> 00:11:08,335
Education is not stupid.
Plus, the military will pay for it.

244
00:11:08,418 --> 00:11:09,920
He's not going into the military, dummy.

245
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:11,004
Are you gonna take that from him, Mike?

246
00:11:11,088 --> 00:11:12,798
- Kick his ass.
- Okay. That's enough.

247
00:11:12,881 --> 00:11:15,759
He should be working.
Contributing to the family. Helping Drea.

248
00:11:15,842 --> 00:11:17,928
Higher education is the key to success.

249
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:20,055
I make the most money
out of anyone in this family

250
00:11:20,138 --> 00:11:21,515
because I got a degree.

251
00:11:21,598 --> 00:11:23,975
You took one class at a technical school
and you got a certificate.

252
00:11:24,059 --> 00:11:25,811
And you made $800 more than me last year.

253
00:11:25,894 --> 00:11:27,979
And is that more or is that less?

254
00:11:28,063 --> 00:11:29,189
Kick his ass, Ryan.

255
00:11:29,272 --> 00:11:31,483
He doesn't need a university
to be educated.

256
00:11:31,566 --> 00:11:33,735
The universe is a university.

257
00:11:33,819 --> 00:11:36,363
- You're homeless. Shut up.
- My home is the planet Earth,

258
00:11:36,446 --> 00:11:38,365
and Mother Nature doesn't charge me rent

259
00:11:38,448 --> 00:11:40,534
nor does Jay whose shed
I've been sleeping in.

260
00:11:40,617 --> 00:11:42,452
God damn it, Mondo, stay out of my shed.

261
00:11:42,536 --> 00:11:44,121
Hey, well, someone better
kick someone's ass.

262
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:52,546
Just relax. And you? Stay out of my shed.

263
00:11:53,547 --> 00:11:55,674
Oh, I get it. Cloud of bees.

264
00:12:31,186 --> 00:12:33,684
Balance

265
00:12:39,009 --> 00:12:42,304
When I said
don't say a word about college,

266
00:12:42,304 --> 00:12:46,850
did I need to define what a word is
for your little T-Rex brains?

267
00:12:46,933 --> 00:12:48,310
Listen to me.

268
00:12:48,393 --> 00:12:50,770
We are gonna fill this house with joy
or I swear to God

269
00:12:50,854 --> 00:12:54,024
I will slit all of your throats.

270
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:56,860
Denise. Hey, girl.

271
00:12:56,943 --> 00:12:59,988
Man, what's got her all worked up?

272
00:13:00,071 --> 00:13:01,448
Us.

273
00:13:01,531 --> 00:13:03,408
Oh. Right.

274
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:08,538
You spelled it wrong.
There's an apostrophe in congratulations.

275
00:13:08,622 --> 00:13:12,167
- No, there's not.
- Yes, there is before the S. Like this.

276
00:13:12,918 --> 00:13:14,044
That's definitely wrong.

277
00:13:14,127 --> 00:13:16,171
They don't do spelling
at "Universe University"?

278
00:13:16,254 --> 00:13:18,548
Ryan, who's right, me or Mike?

279
00:13:19,174 --> 00:13:22,344
{\an8}Huh. Well, I know the answer
because I got a degree.

280
00:13:22,427 --> 00:13:24,054
- Certificate.
- But I will not tell you the answer

281
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:25,639
- because you're a dick.
- Hmm.

282
00:13:25,722 --> 00:13:28,266
If it were me, I would just pay
for the bakery to ice the cake,

283
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:31,436
because I can afford these things,
'cause I got a job,

284
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,230
- because I got a degree.
- Certificate.

285
00:13:33,313 --> 00:13:34,648
- Rollie.
- Yo.

286
00:13:34,731 --> 00:13:36,483
Come here. Is this right?

287
00:13:36,566 --> 00:13:37,484
It's ugly.

288
00:13:37,567 --> 00:13:40,654
So if you meant for it to be ugly,
then, yeah, it's right.

289
00:13:40,737 --> 00:13:42,197
Hey, good job.

290
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:44,783
Apostrophe shows ownership
or combines words.

291
00:13:44,866 --> 00:13:46,826
Mm-hmm. Right.

292
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:51,164
And this is Primo's cake,
so he owns it, so it needs an apostrophe.

293
00:13:51,248 --> 00:13:53,750
You know what? Good idea. Here.
Let's put apostrophes everywhere.

294
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:56,211
- Look. Ra...
-  No, Mike. Don't be crazy.

295
00:13:56,294 --> 00:13:57,629
No, Mike. Stop it. Stop it, Mike.

296
00:13:57,712 --> 00:13:59,548
- You're being crazy. Mike. Come on, Mike.
- No, no, no.

297
00:13:59,631 --> 00:14:02,133
- You want apostrophe.
I'll give you apostrophe.

298
00:14:02,217 --> 00:14:05,679
- Apostrophe. Apostrophe.
One for Ryan. One for you.

299
00:14:05,762 --> 00:14:07,347
Did you finish the cake?

300
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:10,559
Yes.

301
00:14:12,435 --> 00:14:14,646
There you go. Cake time, everybody.

302
00:14:14,729 --> 00:14:16,523
- Hey, Ma.
-  Yeah?

303
00:14:16,606 --> 00:14:17,816
- Don't get mad but...
-  Uh-hmm.

304
00:14:17,899 --> 00:14:20,151
...I was getting on the computer
and your bank account page was up

305
00:14:20,235 --> 00:14:21,194
and I saw that you only have...

306
00:14:21,278 --> 00:14:23,655
Oh, no, no. Don't worry about that.
I have it under control.

307
00:14:23,738 --> 00:14:27,951
What do you mean don't worry about it?
Ma, you only have $52 in your account.

308
00:14:28,034 --> 00:14:30,412
You're throwing me a party.
You just bought me this new coat.

309
00:14:30,495 --> 00:14:33,415
Rafa, you have small eyes.
You can't see the whole picture yet.

310
00:14:33,498 --> 00:14:35,709
Why are you talking
like the Oracle from  The Matrix?

311
00:14:35,792 --> 00:14:37,085
This is serious.

312
00:14:37,168 --> 00:14:41,381
College costs money that you don't have.
That we don't have.

313
00:14:41,464 --> 00:14:43,592
Rafa, relax.

314
00:14:43,675 --> 00:14:45,802
All of this has been in the works
for a long time.

315
00:14:46,595 --> 00:14:49,097
Last month, Carlos,
who you saw at the store earlier,

316
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:51,308
kept talking about how he had a rash
on his foot.

317
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:53,435
So, you know, Gloria,
the receptionist at the clinic,

318
00:14:53,518 --> 00:14:56,313
she traded me some samples
of the foot medicine for some bus passes,

319
00:14:56,396 --> 00:14:59,190
because I know she rides the bus,
because it stops in front of the store

320
00:14:59,274 --> 00:15:00,650
and I see her getting on it each morning.

321
00:15:00,734 --> 00:15:02,027
How did you get bus passes?

322
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:03,978
I always hear Sammy,
the bus driver,

323
00:15:03,978 --> 00:15:06,406
complaining about having to eat a cold lunch every day

324
00:15:06,489 --> 00:15:08,825
because his break isn't long enough
to find some place to eat.

325
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:12,203
So, I made him a hot plate
every day for a week

326
00:15:12,287 --> 00:15:13,872
and he slipped me some bus passes.

327
00:15:13,955 --> 00:15:17,334
So, food for Sammy,
bus passes for Gloria,

328
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:21,129
foot medicine for Carlos,
and he has a booth at the flea market

329
00:15:21,212 --> 00:15:24,716
where he sells clothes
and he gave me the coat
for free.

330
00:15:25,884 --> 00:15:28,303
So, if Carlos didn't have
some gross foot fungus,

331
00:15:28,386 --> 00:15:30,513
I wouldn't have this new coat?

332
00:15:30,597 --> 00:15:34,059
One man's rash is another man's treasure.

333
00:15:34,142 --> 00:15:36,478
Okay. Well, I mean,
what about all the food at this party?

334
00:15:36,561 --> 00:15:38,313
What messed-up skin condition
bought us those ribs?

335
00:15:38,396 --> 00:15:40,398
Oh, that is a good one. Okay.

336
00:15:40,482 --> 00:15:42,859
So like, three months ago,
there was this lady up the street

337
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:44,319
who was having trouble with her car.

338
00:15:44,402 --> 00:15:46,613
I could tell by the sound,
it was her alternator.

339
00:15:46,696 --> 00:15:50,784
Stop, stop, stop. This is too much, Ma.
Our life is like a Jenga tower.

340
00:15:50,867 --> 00:15:54,204
We make one tiny wrong move
and it all comes tumbling down.

341
00:15:54,287 --> 00:15:57,248
Do not worry about any of that, okay?
That's my job.

342
00:15:57,332 --> 00:16:00,460
Your job is to be 16 and
figure out what you want.

343
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:03,546
Big eyes.

344
00:16:04,673 --> 00:16:06,007
Okay.

345
00:16:06,091 --> 00:16:08,051
Mm. I love you. Eat some cake.

346
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:34,285
What's up, Uncle Jay? You got a minute?

347
00:16:34,369 --> 00:16:35,453
Yeah, but not much more.

348
00:16:35,537 --> 00:16:37,539
I got Rollie, Mike,
and Mondo working today.

349
00:16:37,622 --> 00:16:39,999
We're running late
because Rollie hit Mike with a shovel.

350
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:41,084
Why?

351
00:16:41,167 --> 00:16:44,087
Because earlier Mike hit Rollie
with a shovel. What's up?

352
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:48,007
Well, you keep saying that I should start
coming to work with you more hours.

353
00:16:48,091 --> 00:16:52,512
Is that offer still available?
I think I need a steady job.

354
00:16:59,853 --> 00:17:01,938
-   You've got, Ryan.
- I know, stupid.

355
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:03,648
Rafa is here with me right now.

356
00:17:03,732 --> 00:17:06,151
I want you to hear the conversation
him and I are about to have

357
00:17:06,234 --> 00:17:07,777
so that you can know that I beat you.

358
00:17:07,861 --> 00:17:09,487
-   What are you talking about?
- Go ahead, Rafa.

359
00:17:09,571 --> 00:17:11,281
Uh, hi, Uncle Ryan.

360
00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:13,950
I was just telling Uncle Jay
I think I'm ready to start working.

361
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:15,827
Jay, Rollie hit me in the head
with a shovel.

362
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:17,036
Hey, he's lying.

363
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:19,372
- Hey, Primo, what are you doing here?
- Good. You're all here,

364
00:17:19,456 --> 00:17:21,583
so now you can all hear
what Rafa was about to say.

365
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:24,210
Uncle Jay, I kind of just wanted
to talk to you like one on one.

366
00:17:24,294 --> 00:17:25,754
Well, this is better than one on one.

367
00:17:25,837 --> 00:17:28,339
- It's a full uncle meeting.
-  I don't want that.

368
00:17:28,423 --> 00:17:32,719
I-I never want that.
I want the opposite of an uncle meeting.

369
00:17:32,802 --> 00:17:34,053
An aunt separation?

370
00:17:34,137 --> 00:17:35,638
Hey, that was pretty good.

371
00:17:36,639 --> 00:17:38,349
Hey, I'm sorry I hit you with a shovel.

372
00:17:38,433 --> 00:17:39,601
Hey, Primo, listen.

373
00:17:39,684 --> 00:17:42,937
I'm sorry that I couldn't be there
for this great conversation,

374
00:17:43,021 --> 00:17:46,274
but I can't be there
because I have a good job,

375
00:17:46,357 --> 00:17:48,902
- 'cause I have a higher degree.
- Certificate.

376
00:17:48,985 --> 00:17:52,322
Primo, if the concern is money,
then you should know the military

377
00:17:52,405 --> 00:17:54,824
will pay for your schooling
if you serve four years.

378
00:17:54,908 --> 00:17:56,743
- That's what I did.
- You didn't go to college.

379
00:17:56,826 --> 00:17:58,953
But I could've and they would have paid.

380
00:17:59,037 --> 00:18:02,123
Hey, for the record, I don't really care
what Primo decides.

381
00:18:02,207 --> 00:18:04,125
I just hate Ryan. What's up, Ryan?

382
00:18:04,209 --> 00:18:07,128
Actually, I hate all you guys.
I wish I had a giant shovel.

383
00:18:07,212 --> 00:18:11,633
College is just handcuffs for the mind,
and money's a disease.

384
00:18:11,716 --> 00:18:13,134
Great. I won't pay you for today.

385
00:18:13,218 --> 00:18:15,011
Fine. Then I'm moving out of your shed.

386
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:18,014
- That's what I want.
- Can you please just stop?

387
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:20,683
I came here to talk to Uncle Jay
about working...

388
00:18:20,767 --> 00:18:23,102
-
- ...but this, what's happening right now,

389
00:18:23,186 --> 00:18:24,729
is what happens all of the time.

390
00:18:24,813 --> 00:18:27,941
You guys just come over the top
of everything, and it's chaos,

391
00:18:28,024 --> 00:18:29,818
and none of you even listen
to what I'm saying.

392
00:18:29,901 --> 00:18:31,277
Hey, I listen. They don't listen.

393
00:18:31,361 --> 00:18:32,946
That's not true.
You don't listen to any of us.

394
00:18:41,621 --> 00:18:42,956
What's going on, guys?

395
00:18:44,207 --> 00:18:45,834
- Is that Drea?
- Yeah.

396
00:18:45,917 --> 00:18:49,504
And like I was saying, we shouldn't
be doing this without Drea present...

397
00:18:49,587 --> 00:18:51,756
Good news.
Primo's decided he wants to...

398
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,508
Shut up, Jay.

399
00:18:53,591 --> 00:18:54,759
- Mike.
- Mm-hmm?

400
00:18:54,843 --> 00:18:56,135
Give me your keys.

401
00:18:56,219 --> 00:18:59,722
I'm gonna drive Rafa home
and I'll see you all at dinner tonight.

402
00:19:05,103 --> 00:19:07,272
Oh, that super calm, quiet voice.

403
00:19:07,355 --> 00:19:08,773
Hey, she's pissed.

404
00:19:09,774 --> 00:19:11,734
Hey, she might kick someone's ass though.

405
00:19:15,113 --> 00:19:17,115
- I don't understand why you're mad.

406
00:19:17,198 --> 00:19:18,908
I didn't go to Primo. He came to me

407
00:19:18,992 --> 00:19:20,535
and said he wants to work.
How is that bad?

408
00:19:20,618 --> 00:19:23,079
A decision that you pressed him to make.

409
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:26,499
But don't you want him to go to college?
Why aren't you telling him that?

410
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:28,084
Why aren't you telling him anything?

411
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:30,503
What I want is for you all
to leave him alone.

412
00:19:30,587 --> 00:19:33,464
- Okay. I understand but...
- No buts, Ryan.

413
00:19:33,548 --> 00:19:35,174
You guys have to understand

414
00:19:35,258 --> 00:19:38,303
that your influence on him
is meaningful, okay?

415
00:19:38,386 --> 00:19:41,222
This is not like you teaching him
how to ride a bike.

416
00:19:41,306 --> 00:19:43,308
He's not a kid anymore.

417
00:19:43,391 --> 00:19:45,435
You could push him
toward making a decision

418
00:19:45,518 --> 00:19:47,979
that he will regret for a long time.

419
00:19:48,062 --> 00:19:51,399
Now, I want him to go to college.
That's what I want.

420
00:19:51,482 --> 00:19:55,403
But whatever he chooses,
it's a decision that he needs to arrive at

421
00:19:55,486 --> 00:19:58,031
on his own or it's not going to work.

422
00:19:58,114 --> 00:20:01,659
That doesn't make sense.
If you want a thing, speak up.

423
00:20:01,743 --> 00:20:03,369
It's like a restaurant.

424
00:20:03,453 --> 00:20:06,080
You don't just hope for the waiter
to bring you cheese sticks.

425
00:20:06,164 --> 00:20:07,373
You tell him.

426
00:20:07,457 --> 00:20:08,625
So, you're smart today?

427
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:10,543
I'm smart every day.

428
00:20:10,627 --> 00:20:12,378
Your t-shirt's on backwards.

429
00:20:13,338 --> 00:20:14,505
Man.

430
00:20:16,633 --> 00:20:17,967
It's a v-neck.

431
00:20:19,093 --> 00:20:20,845
What is wrong with you?

432
00:20:20,929 --> 00:20:22,639
I thought it was from Europe.

433
00:20:25,099 --> 00:20:27,685
He's like a magician
with that cane, man.

434
00:20:29,812 --> 00:20:33,358
Hey, your mom took off for work already
but she left food for you on the table.

435
00:20:34,651 --> 00:20:36,194
And then you ate it.

436
00:20:36,277 --> 00:20:37,403
I did eat the food, yes.

437
00:20:37,487 --> 00:20:39,030
Perfect.

438
00:20:39,113 --> 00:20:41,658
Hey, hold up, boy.
Hey, you forgot something.

439
00:20:41,741 --> 00:20:44,619
What? What did I forgot, Uncle Rollie?
Do you want my lunch too?

440
00:20:44,702 --> 00:20:46,287
Do you wanna hit me with a shovel?

441
00:20:49,582 --> 00:20:51,542
How'd you know I threw that away?

442
00:20:51,626 --> 00:20:54,671
- Or even what it was?
-  I didn't.

443
00:20:54,754 --> 00:20:57,423
I was looking for chicken wings
people might've tossed out,

444
00:20:57,507 --> 00:21:00,843
because most people when they eat wings,
only eat like half the meat.

445
00:21:00,927 --> 00:21:04,222
So, if you gather enough of them,
it's basically like a whole extra meal.

446
00:21:04,305 --> 00:21:05,306
Gross.

447
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:09,227
Anyways, I found that paper.
Didn't know why you threw it away.

448
00:21:10,311 --> 00:21:11,521
What's going on, Primo?

449
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:15,274
I don't know what to do.

450
00:21:15,358 --> 00:21:17,819
I have way too many opinions
coming at me at once.

451
00:21:17,902 --> 00:21:20,029
It's like, you know,
do I--do I go to college?

452
00:21:20,113 --> 00:21:22,323
Do I start working?
Do I join the military?

453
00:21:22,407 --> 00:21:24,242
Do I join the military
and then go to college?

454
00:21:24,325 --> 00:21:27,286
And how does ma figure into any of it
because she has $50 to her name

455
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:29,038
- so who's gonna take care of her?
- Hey, wait.

456
00:21:29,122 --> 00:21:30,957
Hold up. Hold up.

457
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:33,751
You don't think you'd take
care of your mom, do you?

458
00:21:33,835 --> 00:21:37,839
I mean, she's been taking care of
all of us
since she was like 12 years old.

459
00:21:37,922 --> 00:21:40,091
I mean, you saying
you'd take care of your mom

460
00:21:40,174 --> 00:21:42,844
is like saying a flower
takes care of the sun.

461
00:21:42,927 --> 00:21:45,763
And, second, boohoo.

462
00:21:45,847 --> 00:21:49,600
So, you've got six people in this house
who give a damn about what happens to you.

463
00:21:49,684 --> 00:21:50,852
That must suck.

464
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:54,689
All right. Look,
I'm not gonna sit here and tell you

465
00:21:54,772 --> 00:21:57,316
that we're not gonna keep
shoving advice into your ear

466
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,401
because we are.

467
00:21:59,235 --> 00:22:02,071
That's what we do.
We've been doing it since you were tiny

468
00:22:02,155 --> 00:22:04,907
and we're gonna keep doing it
till we're all dead.

469
00:22:04,991 --> 00:22:07,035
Hey, but, ultimately, that's your call.

470
00:22:07,952 --> 00:22:09,996
And whatever you decide to do,
it'll be fine.

471
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:12,832
And your mom will be fine too,
because besides her own toughness,

472
00:22:12,915 --> 00:22:15,126
hey, she's got us. Her brothers.

473
00:22:16,252 --> 00:22:18,504
Every single one of us
would do jail time for her.

474
00:22:18,588 --> 00:22:20,006
Hell, I just did.

475
00:22:20,089 --> 00:22:22,675
You didn't serve jail time for her.

476
00:22:22,759 --> 00:22:25,136
You served jail time
'cause you jumped a dog track

477
00:22:25,219 --> 00:22:26,763
and tried to race the greyhounds.

478
00:22:26,846 --> 00:22:29,640
Let me tell you something.
Those skinny bitches are fast.

479
00:22:29,724 --> 00:22:31,392
I stand corrected.

480
00:22:31,476 --> 00:22:34,270
Hey, get out of here. I'm trying
to watch my show. Bug off.

481
00:22:50,828 --> 00:22:55,458
Okay, okay, okay, everyone.
Uh, I have an announcement to make.

482
00:22:55,541 --> 00:22:57,126
Didn't we do this already?

483
00:22:57,210 --> 00:22:59,504
I have decided

484
00:22:59,587 --> 00:23:03,299
that I am going to apply
to that college prep program.

485
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:05,718
And I don't know
what happens after that just yet

486
00:23:05,802 --> 00:23:09,305
but I do know that this is the decision
I wanna make right now

487
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:12,058
and so...I'm making it.

488
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:15,311
We're so proud of you, baby.

489
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:17,855
Whatever your path is, man,
that's your path.

490
00:23:17,939 --> 00:23:19,190
That poem sucked.

491
00:23:19,273 --> 00:23:21,609
If this blows up in your face
and you need a job,

492
00:23:21,692 --> 00:23:22,944
I'll be here.

493
00:23:23,027 --> 00:23:25,822
Primo, all that matters
is that you're happy.

494
00:23:25,905 --> 00:23:29,408
-  Mm-hmm.
- And that you basically chose my thing.

495
00:23:29,492 --> 00:23:32,870
Those are the two main takeaways
we should all be focusing as a family.

496
00:23:32,954 --> 00:23:34,622
Okay. Let's eat.

497
00:23:34,705 --> 00:23:39,085
Actually, the point is that
I'm grateful for you guys.

498
00:23:39,168 --> 00:23:41,546
You are all looking out for me

499
00:23:41,629 --> 00:23:44,382
and I'm sure I'm gonna to need
to lean on all of you all

500
00:23:44,465 --> 00:23:48,302
at the appropriate times
for advice on different things.

501
00:23:48,386 --> 00:23:49,679
Like when you're gonna ask Mya out?

502
00:23:49,762 --> 00:23:51,430
Who told you Mya is the girl I like?

503
00:23:51,514 --> 00:23:54,225
Our brains every time
we see you make google eyes at her.

504
00:23:54,308 --> 00:23:56,644
Hold on. Did you just say google eyes?

505
00:23:56,727 --> 00:23:59,689
Yeah. Google eyes.
That's why they call it Google.

506
00:23:59,772 --> 00:24:01,941
It's like your eyes
are searching for information.

507
00:24:02,024 --> 00:24:03,985
No. It's goo-goo eyes.

508
00:24:04,068 --> 00:24:06,612
No, it's googly eyes.

509
00:24:06,696 --> 00:24:09,532
Gentleman, it's ghoul-y.
Like a ghoul,

510
00:24:09,615 --> 00:24:12,535
because you're so scared
of how much you like that person.

511
00:24:12,618 --> 00:24:15,288
That is the dumbest thing
I have ever heard anybody say.

512
00:24:37,727 --> 00:24:40,688
No apostrophe. Mike was right.

513
00:24:44,025 --> 00:24:45,818
I wonder if there's any cake left.
