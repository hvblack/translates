1
00:00:01,133 --> 00:00:03,291
C-SPAN

2
00:00:03,291 --> 00:00:06,025
CAN YOU BELIEVE
COOKER SPANIEL

3
00:00:06,025 --> 00:00:09,487
IN THE CLOSING
STATEMENTS OF THE JANUARY 6th COMMITTEE

4
00:00:09,487 --> 00:00:12,555
TO INVESTIGATE THE
ATTACK ON THE NATION'S CAPITOL.

5
00:00:18,902 --> 00:00:23,772
>> ALL RIGHT.
WE HAVE TO LET THE COMMITTEE COME TO ORDER

6
00:00:23,772 --> 00:00:25,717
FOR ITS NINTH AND
FINAL HEARING.

7
00:00:25,717 --> 00:00:28,711
THE JANUARY 6th WAS ONE OF THE
MOST DRAMATIC

8
00:00:28,711 --> 00:00:31,410
AND CONSEQUENTIAL
MOMENTS IN OUR NATION'S HISTORY.

9
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:37,108
SO TO FIGHT BACK, WE ASSEMBLED A
TEAM OF MONOTONE NERDS TO DO A
POWERPOINT.

10
00:00:37,108 --> 00:00:39,969
>> I DID MINE WITH GOOGLE FLY.

11
00:00:39,969 --> 00:00:43,419
>> WE'VE BEEN INVESTIGATING THIS
HORRIBLE ATTACK FOR MORE THAN A YEAR,

12
00:00:43,419 --> 00:00:45,677
BUT TODAY'S SESSION IS
GOING TO BE A LITTLE DIFFERENT.

13
00:00:45,677 --> 00:00:50,004
WE'RE GOING TO SUMMARIZE OUR
FINDINGS, HOLD A HISTORY-MAKING VOTE,

14
00:00:50,004 --> 00:00:52,746
AND THEN, AND ONLY THEN --

15
00:00:52,746 --> 00:00:56,482
WE ALL GET TO HAVE A LITTLE
TREAT.

16
00:00:56,482 --> 00:01:00,404
>> AW, COME ON, CAN'T I HAVE ONE
CUPCAKE NOW?

17
00:01:00,404 --> 00:01:03,108
>> NO, NO, NO, NO.
IT'S EVIDENCE,

18
00:01:03,108 --> 00:01:06,242
THEN A VOTE, THEN
A LITTLE TREAT.

19
00:01:06,242 --> 00:01:10,365
ALL RIGHT, I WOULD FIRST LIKE TO
RECOGNIZE THE GENTLE LADY FROM WYOMING

20
00:01:10,365 --> 00:01:13,985
WHO I AM SHOCKED TO SAY
HAS BECOME MY BEST FRIEND.

21
00:01:13,985 --> 00:01:16,370
LIZ CHENEY.

22
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:18,955
>> THANK YOU, BENNIE.

23
00:01:18,955 --> 00:01:22,370
OVER THE PAST FEW MONTHS, THIS
BIPARTISAN COMMITTEE

24
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:25,106
HAS
PRESENTED OUR CASE TO ALL
AMERICANS.

25
00:01:25,106 --> 00:01:27,744
WHETHER YOU'RE A REPUBLICAN
WHO'S NOT WATCHING,

26
00:01:27,744 --> 00:01:32,047
OR A
DEMOCRAT WHO'S NODDING SO HARD
YOUR HEAD IS FALLING OFF --

27
00:01:32,047 --> 00:01:36,378
ONE PERSON IS RESPONSIBLE FOR
THIS INSURRECTION, DONALD TRUMP.

28
00:01:36,378 --> 00:01:40,625
AND ONE PERSON WILL SUFFER THE
CONSEQUENCES, ME.

29
00:01:40,625 --> 00:01:43,897
YOU MIGHT BE WONDERING WHAT
MAKES ME SO TOUGH.

30
00:01:43,897 --> 00:01:47,391
AND I ASK YOU, WHO IS YOUR DAD?

31
00:01:47,391 --> 00:01:49,837
IS IT DICK CHENEY?

32
00:01:49,837 --> 00:01:55,176
YOU MIGHT WONDER, WHEN YOU HAVE
THE GUTS TO TAKE ON YOUR ENTIRE
PARTY ALONE.

33
00:01:55,176 --> 00:01:59,610
I SAY, WHEN YOU WERE LITTLE, WHO
TUCKED YOU IN AT NIGHT?

34
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:02,414
WAS IT DICK CHENEY?

35
00:02:02,414 --> 00:02:06,108
I'VE BEEN ASKED, HOW DID YOU GET
A BACKBONE MADE OF STEEL?

36
00:02:06,108 --> 00:02:08,875
AND I ASK BACK, FOR YOUR 10th BIRTHDAY,

37
00:02:08,875 --> 00:02:12,396
DID YOU EAT PIZZA AT
CHUCK E. CHEESE WITH ALL YOUR
FRIENDS?

38
00:02:12,396 --> 00:02:15,737
OR DID YOU SHOOT A DEER IN THE
FACE WITH DICK CHENEY?

39
00:02:15,737 --> 00:02:21,491
SO YEAH, I GUESS YOU COULD SAY I
HAVE BIG DICK CHENEY ENERGY.

40
00:02:21,491 --> 00:02:25,857
>> WELL.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH, GENTLE LADY
FROM WYOMING.

41
00:02:25,857 --> 00:02:29,247
THE CHAIR NOW RECOGNIZES THE
GENTLEMAN FROM CALIFORNIA,

42
00:02:29,247 --> 00:02:33,040
AND
MAYBE THE HORROR MOVIE SMILE?

43
00:02:35,367 --> 00:02:38,490
ACTUALLY, NO, NO, NO, WE GONNA
SKIP HIM.

44
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:39,692
TOO SPOOKY.

45
00:02:39,692 --> 00:02:43,879
ALL RIGHT.
THE CHAIR INSTEAD RECOGNIZES THE
GENTLEMAN FROM MARYLAND.

46
00:02:43,879 --> 00:02:46,108
>> THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN.

47
00:02:46,108 --> 00:02:48,454
LEADING UP TO JANUARY 6th,

48
00:02:48,454 --> 00:02:52,401
THE FBI SCOURED
THROUGH ALT-RIGHT MESSAGE BOARDS

49
00:02:52,401 --> 00:02:55,939
AND FOUND
DISTURBING COMMENTS LIKE,

50
00:02:55,939 --> 00:02:59,211
WHO
WANTS TO BURN D.C. TO THE
GROUND?

51
00:02:59,211 --> 00:03:02,366
ANYONE GOT ROOM IN THEIR CAR FOR
ME,

52
00:03:02,366 --> 00:03:05,420
10 RIFLES AND 30 SNAKES?

53
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:08,144
WHERE DO WE PARK?

54
00:03:08,144 --> 00:03:13,770
IS THERE A SHUTTLE FROM LA
QUINTA INN TO COUP?

55
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:19,335
AM I AT WRONG WASHINGTON?
I SEE SPACE NEEDLE.

56
00:03:19,335 --> 00:03:24,248
YET AGAIN, PRESIDENT TRUMP
DIDN'T RAISE A FINGER.

57
00:03:24,248 --> 00:03:29,302
AND WHILE THESE HOOLIGANS WERE
RANSACKING OUR BELOVED CAPITOL,

58
00:03:29,302 --> 00:03:33,693
REAL LEADERS LIKE NANCY PELOSI
AND CHUCK SCHUMER

59
00:03:33,693 --> 00:03:38,691
WERE BUNKERED
IN A SENATE HIDE-AWAY TRYING TO
SAVE THE COUNTRY.

60
00:03:38,691 --> 00:03:42,342
>> YES, HELLO, MR. VICE
PRESIDENT.
IT'S SPEAKER PELOSI.

61
00:03:42,342 --> 00:03:44,243
WHAT IS HAPPENING OVER THERE?

62
00:03:44,243 --> 00:03:47,100
CAN WE GET BACK TO THE CAPITOL
AND RESUME THE VOTE

63
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:51,440
IN HELLO,
DOORDASH?
IT'S CHUCK SCHUMER!

64
00:03:51,753 --> 00:03:56,009
YES, WE STILL HAVEN'T RECEIVED
ANY OF OUR LUNCH ORDERS!

65
00:03:56,009 --> 00:04:01,326
DID CHANGE THE DROP-OFF LOCATION, DUE TO
SOME UNFORTUNATE TREASON,

66
00:04:01,326 --> 00:04:03,219
BUT IT
SHOULD HAVE ARRIVED BY NOW.

67
00:04:03,219 --> 00:04:07,413
>> THE PRESIDENT IS DOING
NOTHING, THIS IS COMPLETELY
UNACCEPTABLE.

68
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:11,837
>> MY ORDER?
DILL PICKLES STILL FLOATING IN
THE JUICE

69
00:04:11,837 --> 00:04:13,724
AND A PASTRAMI SANDWICH

70
00:04:13,724 --> 00:04:17,678
WITH VERY LIGHT
MUSTARD, DO YOU HEAR ME?

71
00:04:17,679 --> 00:04:20,412
NEGATIVE REVIEW

72
00:04:20,412 --> 00:04:23,708
I'M IN A CONFINED SPACE WITH 30
PEOPLE.

73
00:04:23,708 --> 00:04:29,485
IF I GET AN UPSET STOMACH, ALL
HELL IS GOING TO BREAK LOOSE.

74
00:04:29,485 --> 00:04:32,896
>> AND IT CONTINUES FOR HOURS
FROM THERE.

75
00:04:32,896 --> 00:04:34,807
>> WELL, THANK YOU, MR. RASKIN.

76
00:04:34,807 --> 00:04:38,368
THE CHAIR NOW RECOGNIZES THE
TENDERONI FROM ILLINOIS.

77
00:04:38,368 --> 00:04:41,552
>> THANK YOU, MR. CHAIR.
I TOOK A CUPCAKE.

78
00:04:41,552 --> 00:04:46,337
NOW, DONALD TRUMP KNEW HE HAD
LOST THE ELECTION.

79
00:04:46,337 --> 00:04:47,759
EVERYONE AROUND HIM KNEW.

80
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:50,698
HE ASKED WHITE HOUSE COUNSEL PAT
CIPOLLONE,

81
00:04:50,698 --> 00:04:52,507
DID I LOSE THE
ELECTION?

82
00:04:52,507 --> 00:04:55,056
AND PAT SAID, YES.

83
00:04:55,056 --> 00:04:57,405
HE THEN ASKED IVANKA.

84
00:04:57,405 --> 00:04:59,717
DID I REALLY LOSE THE ELECTION?

85
00:04:59,717 --> 00:05:02,481
SHE SAID, YES.

86
00:05:02,481 --> 00:05:04,785
HE THEN TRIED A JANITOR.

87
00:05:04,785 --> 00:05:07,549
HEY, YOU DON'T THINK I LOST, DO
YOU?

88
00:05:07,549 --> 00:05:10,778
THE JANITOR RESPONDED, I DO.

89
00:05:10,778 --> 00:05:14,772
THEN THE PRESIDENT TURNED TO A DOG AND SAID,

90
00:05:14,772 --> 00:05:17,438
WHAT ABOUT YOU?
DID I WIN?

91
00:05:17,438 --> 00:05:21,365
AND THE DOG LEGIT SHOOK ITS HEAD
SIDE TO SIDE

92
00:05:21,365 --> 00:05:25,047
THEN BARKED A
PERFECT HUMAN "NO."

93
00:05:25,047 --> 00:05:28,485
DONALD WAS DESPERATE TO HANG ON
TO POWER.

94
00:05:28,485 --> 00:05:32,093
MEANWHILE, REAL HEROES LIKE
NANCY PELOSI AND CHUCK SCHUMER

95
00:05:32,093 --> 00:05:34,851
WERE THE ONES ACTUALLY RUNNING
THIS COUNTRY.

96
00:05:34,851 --> 00:05:38,540
>> MR. VICE PRESIDENT, MR. VICE
PRESIDENT, SPEAKER PELOSI AGAIN.

97
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:40,820
TELL THEM I'M HERE TOO.

98
00:05:41,255 --> 00:05:44,250
MR. VICE PRESIDENT, WHERE IS
PRESIDENT TRUMP?

99
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:45,846
WHAT IS HE DOING TO STOP THIS?

100
00:05:45,846 --> 00:05:49,627
>> HI, MIKE, IT'S CHUCK SCHUMER,
I'M HERE AS WELL!

101
00:05:49,627 --> 00:05:53,361
>> LET ME TELL YOU, IF TRUMP
COMES HERE RIGHT NOW, I'M GOING
TO PUNCH HIM RIGHT IN THE FACE.

102
00:05:53,361 --> 00:05:56,069
THEN I'LL BE HAPPY.

103
00:05:56,069 --> 00:06:00,445
>> LET ME TELL YOU, IF TRUMP
COMES, I'M GOING TO LET HIM
PUNCH ME IN THE FACE,

104
00:06:00,445 --> 00:06:03,697
I'LL GO TO
THE HOSPITAL, FREE SOUP.

105
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:08,788
>> NOT SURE IF SCHUMER NEEDS TO
BE IN ALL THESE CLIPS.

106
00:06:08,788 --> 00:06:11,173
MISS CHENEY, ANY FINAL THOUGHTS?

107
00:06:11,173 --> 00:06:15,625
>> THE FACT IS TRUMP PLANNED TO
DECLARE VICTORY NO MATTER THE
RESULTS.

108
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:19,360
LOOK AT THIS VIDEO OF THE
PRESIDENT THE DAY BEFORE THE
ELECTION.

109
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:24,265
>> THE VOTES DON'T MATTER, I'VE
ALWAYS SAID THAT THE VOTES DON'T
MATTER AT ALL.

110
00:06:24,265 --> 00:06:26,286
WHAT EVEN IS A VOTE?

111
00:06:26,286 --> 00:06:31,154
IT'S A PIECE OF PAPER YOU FOLD
UP, PUT IT IN A HAT, A GUY
SHAKES IT AROUND.

112
00:06:31,154 --> 00:06:35,285
HE HAD A GREAT HAT, IT WAS VERY TALL,

113
00:06:35,285 --> 00:06:37,310
HE BORROWED IT FROM APOLLO CREED

114
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:39,896
WHO IS A VERY CLOSE FRIEND OF MINE,

115
00:06:39,896 --> 00:06:42,618
WE TALK ON THE PHONE
EVERY DAY, OUR WIVES ARE
FRIENDS.

116
00:06:42,618 --> 00:06:45,231
HE SHOULD NEVER HAVE DIED IN
THAT RING.

117
00:06:45,231 --> 00:06:49,426
HE GETS WHACKED IN THE HEAD, AND BOOM,

118
00:06:49,426 --> 00:06:51,779
WHERE'S THE OBAMACARE?

119
00:06:51,779 --> 00:06:55,147
NO, WE DON'T VOTE, WE DON'T
VOTE.

120
00:06:55,147 --> 00:06:57,213
IT'S OPEN!

121
00:06:57,213 --> 00:06:59,056
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

122
00:06:59,056 --> 00:07:01,831
IS MIKE PENCE DEAD YET?

123
00:07:01,831 --> 00:07:07,688
>> ALL RIGHT, I THINK WE'VE SEEN
QUITE ENOUGH.

124
00:07:07,688 --> 00:07:10,904
LET US NOW TAKE A VOTE, SHOULD
WE SUBPOENA PRESIDENT TRUMP

125
00:07:10,904 --> 00:07:13,352
AND
FORCE HIM TO TESTIFY BEFORE THIS
COMMITTEE?

126
00:07:13,352 --> 00:07:17,760
>> YES, WE MUST.
AND THIS VOTE IS NOT JUST AN
EMPTY GESTURE.

127
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:19,695
HE WILL TESTIFY.

128
00:07:19,695 --> 00:07:23,315
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
HE WILL GET ON A PLANE

129
00:07:23,315 --> 00:07:26,363
AND LEAVE
FLORIDA, WHERE HE IS BELOVED,

130
00:07:26,363 --> 00:07:30,920
AND HE WILL FLY TO WASHINGTON
WHERE HE IS HATED,

131
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:34,471
AND HE WILL
ANSWER MY QUESTIONS.

132
00:07:34,471 --> 00:07:35,956
QUESTIONS LIKE,

133
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:40,646
HEY! WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE,
MISTER!

134
00:07:40,646 --> 00:07:46,176
>> TRUMP IS 100% COMING AND THIS
TIME HE WILL BE HELD
ACCOUNTABLE.

135
00:07:46,176 --> 00:07:50,959
SURE, HE GOT AWAY WITH A LOT OF
STUFF IN THE '70s, THE '80s, THE '90s,

136
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:55,407
THE EARLY 2000s, THE
2010s, AND THE EARLY 2020S.

137
00:07:55,407 --> 00:07:59,212
BUT THAT ENDS NOW!
WITH US.

138
00:07:59,212 --> 00:08:01,378
BECAUSE I'M --

139
00:08:01,705 --> 00:08:04,666
MR. KINZINGER.

140
00:08:04,666 --> 00:08:07,259
AND HE WILL RESPECT MY
AUTHORITY.

141
00:08:07,259 --> 00:08:11,641
>> ALL RIGHT, WELL, I CAN
ALREADY SEE THIS IS A COMPLETE
ZERO.

142
00:08:11,641 --> 00:08:14,555
I WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUES
FOR THROWING AWAY THEIR SUMMERS,

143
00:08:14,555 --> 00:08:17,805
AND IN SOME CASES THEIR CAREERS,
TO SERVE ON THIS COMMITTEE.

144
00:08:17,805 --> 00:08:20,045
>> HEY NO PROBLEM.
>> MY CALENDAR WAS EMPTY.

145
00:08:20,045 --> 00:08:22,588
>> I DO HAVE A COUPLE OF
REGRETS.

146
00:08:22,588 --> 00:08:26,703
>> AMERICA, I DON'T KNOW WHAT
MORE WE COULD POSSIBLY SHOW YOU

147
00:08:26,703 --> 00:08:30,094
EXCEPT MAYBE THIS CLIP OF NANCY
PELOSI SAYING POO-POO.

148
00:08:30,094 --> 00:08:34,012

AND I DID THAT
WHILE GOING ON A WORLD TOUR.

177
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:49,272
SO NOW I CAN GO BY ANOTHER NAME.

ALWAYS WANTED TO HELP THE PEOPLE
IN MY COMMUNITY.

IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE CALLED,
HOTGIRLBUMMER BUT SOMEBODY STOLE

187
00:13:22,494 --> 00:13:24,845
YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE.

188
00:13:24,845 --> 00:13:29,332
BEFORE THE SHOW STARTS, THERE'S
SOMETHING I'VE BEEN REALLY
WANTING TO SAY.

189
00:13:29,332 --> 00:13:32,178
I'VE HAD SOME WINS AND I'VE HAD SOME LOSSES

190
00:13:32,178 --> 00:13:34,254
AND I ALWAYS GET
MORE WINS.

191
00:13:34,254 --> 00:13:36,771
BUT I DO PRIDE MYSELF ON BEING
AN OPEN BOOK.

JUST FOLLOW THE ARC OF MY POINT

481
00:22:47,982 --> 00:22:48,715
WITH YOUR EYES TO THE DEER.

482
00:22:48,717 --> 00:22:50,122
>> I SAID IT'S OKAY, I DON'T

483
00:22:50,124 --> 00:22:53,193
REALLY CARE.

484
00:22:53,195 --> 00:22:55,336
>> BUT IT'S RIGHT THERE.

485
00:22:55,338 --> 00:22:59,175
JUST MAKE YOUR EYES GO IN MINE

486
00:22:59,177 --> 00:23:00,326
WITH THE ANGLE OF MY POINT.

487
00:23:00,328 --> 00:23:03,365
>> FORGET, I I DON'T NEED TO SEE

488
00:23:03,367 --> 00:23:04,069
NO DEER!

489
00:23:04,071 --> 00:23:04,389
>> THERE'S A BLOODY RABBIT

490
00:23:04,391 --> 00:23:08,132
RIDING ON THE BACK OF THE DEER!

491
00:23:08,134 --> 00:23:08,515
>> WHAT?

492
00:23:08,517 --> 00:23:12,193
WHERE'S THAT HAPPENING NOW?

493
00:23:13,763 --> 00:23:14,945
>> OH, AND THE BUNNY HAS A TAIL.

494
00:23:14,947 --> 00:23:16,224
>> IF I WANTED TO SEE THAT,

495
00:23:16,226 --> 00:23:16,640
WHERE EXACTLY I WOULD LOOK?

496
00:23:16,642 --> 00:23:18,367
>> IT'S WALKING STRAIGHT TOWARDS

497
00:23:18,369 --> 00:23:19,391
US, SEE?

498
00:23:19,393 --> 00:23:20,062
>> DAD, IMAGINE A LASER COMING

499
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:24,125
FROM MY FINGERS.

500
00:23:24,127 --> 00:23:24,860
>> WHAT?

501
00:23:24,862 --> 00:23:26,716
>> DO YOU SEE THE THIRD CLOUD ON

502
00:23:26,718 --> 00:23:27,707
THE SIDE OF THE SKY?

503
00:23:27,709 --> 00:23:30,362
>> THE SIDE OF THE SKY?

504
00:23:30,364 --> 00:23:30,650
>> RIGHT THERE AT 12:00.

505
00:23:30,652 --> 00:23:32,314
>> EAST COAST OR WEST COAST

506
00:23:32,316 --> 00:23:33,497
TIME?

507
00:23:33,499 --> 00:23:34,681
>> LOOK, THE DEER'S RIGHT THERE,

508
00:23:34,683 --> 00:23:34,937
YOU HAVE TO SEE IT.

509
00:23:34,939 --> 00:23:36,215
>> BUT I DON'T, AND I DON'T WANT

510
00:23:36,217 --> 00:23:36,696
TO.

511
00:23:36,698 --> 00:23:38,647
>> SHOOT, I THINK Y'ALL ARE

512
00:23:38,649 --> 00:23:39,414
MAKING THIS UP.

513
00:23:39,416 --> 00:23:41,078
>> ALL RIGHT, DADDY, IT'S OKAY.

514
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:42,006
LET'S TALK ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE.

515
00:23:42,008 --> 00:23:44,629
>> YEAH, IT'S NOT THAT GREAT OF

516
00:23:44,631 --> 00:23:48,946
A DEER.

517
00:23:48,948 --> 00:23:49,779
>> OH MY GOD, IS THAT THE ONE ON

518
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:51,217
MR. REYNOLDS'S WALK?

519
00:23:51,219 --> 00:23:51,506
>> I WILL NOT.

520
00:23:51,508 --> 00:23:52,177
I HAVE LOST ALL INTEREST IN THE

521
00:23:52,179 --> 00:23:55,376
DEER.

522
00:23:55,378 --> 00:23:55,760
>> IT'S RIGHT THERE WAVING AT

523
00:23:55,761 --> 00:23:57,039
US!

524
00:23:57,745 --> 00:23:59,119
>> I DON'T CARE IF IT'S DOING

525
00:23:59,121 --> 00:24:00,686
THE MACARENA.

526
00:24:00,688 --> 00:24:01,006
>> FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, JUST

527
00:24:01,008 --> 00:24:02,574
TURN AROUND AND YOU'LL SEE IT!

528
00:24:02,576 --> 00:24:07,819
>> OKAY.

529
00:24:07,821 --> 00:24:08,459
FINE.

530
00:24:08,461 --> 00:24:08,971
BUT IT BETTER BE THERE.

531
00:24:08,973 --> 00:24:10,634
>> OH!

532
00:24:10,636 --> 00:24:11,113
>> OH!

533
00:24:11,115 --> 00:24:13,225
>> I'M GOING TO BURN THIS WHOLE

534
00:24:13,227 --> 00:24:13,865
HOUSE DOWN.

535
00:24:13,867 --> 00:24:15,240
>> IT WAS RIGHT THERE, IT JUST

536
00:24:15,242 --> 00:24:16,616
JUMPED DOWN.

537
00:24:16,618 --> 00:24:18,119
>> Y'ALL ARE MESSING WITH ME,

538
00:24:18,121 --> 00:24:19,302
JUST LIKE WHEN YOU PULLED MY

539
00:24:19,304 --> 00:24:20,742
PANTS DOWN AT THE YANKEE GAME.

540
00:24:20,744 --> 00:24:21,414
>> I DIDN'T PULL YOUR PANTS

541
00:24:21,416 --> 00:24:22,085
DOWN, THEY WERE LOOSE, THEY FELL

542
00:24:22,087 --> 00:24:22,789
ON THEIR OWN.

543
00:24:22,791 --> 00:24:23,045
>> WHATEVER.

544
00:24:23,047 --> 00:24:26,467
EVERYBODY ALWAYS MESSING WITH

545
00:24:26,469 --> 00:24:28,963
ME.

546
00:24:28,965 --> 00:24:31,010
>> OH MY GOD!

547
00:24:31,012 --> 00:24:32,257
>> OH MY GOD, DEER IN THE HOUSE!

548
00:24:32,259 --> 00:24:32,545
>> I DON'T WANT TO MEET HER.

549
00:24:32,547 --> 00:24:34,593
I DON'T WANT TO HEAR ABOUT NO

550
00:24:34,595 --> 00:24:35,040
DEER.

551
00:24:35,042 --> 00:24:35,936
>> RIGHT BEHIND YOU!

552
00:24:35,938 --> 00:24:37,855
>> HUGH?

553
00:24:37,857 --> 00:24:40,606
WHO IS HUGH?

554
00:24:40,608 --> 00:24:42,205
>> NOT HUGH, YOU.

555
00:24:42,207 --> 00:24:42,493
>> ME, STOP MESSING WITH ME.

556
00:24:42,495 --> 00:24:42,813
>> MR. REYNOLDS, IT'S GOT A

557
00:24:42,815 --> 00:24:47,387
KNIFE!

558
00:24:47,389 --> 00:24:49,691
>> WHAT?

559
00:24:50,204 --> 00:24:50,938

00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:51,610
US!

561
00:24:51,612 --> 00:24:53,496
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

562
00:24:53,498 --> 00:24:54,137
PACK YOUR BAGS, GIRL.

563
00:24:54,139 --> 00:24:55,480
YOU'RE MOVING BACK TO THE CITY.

564

567
00:25:01,431 --> 00:25:04,245
NO, DADDY.

568
00:25:04,247 --> 00:25:07,283
WE LOVE IT OUT HERE.

569
00:25:08,244 --> 00:25:08,883
I KNOW YOU WORRY ABOUT ME, BUT I

570
00:25:08,885 --> 00:25:11,633
PROMISE WE GOING TO BE OKAY.

571
00:25:11,635 --> 00:25:12,721
>> WELL, I DO WORRY.

572
00:25:12,723 --> 00:25:13,777
MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT.

573
00:25:13,779 --> 00:25:15,024
MAYBE MY BABY GIRL --

574
00:25:15,026 --> 00:25:16,271

MR. REYNOLDS, THE DEER'S PULLING

576
00:25:19,056 --> 00:25:22,253

THE TEA IS HOT AND THE BRAS ARE

581
00:25:57,729 --> 00:26:03,036
OFF.

582
00:26:03,038 --> 00:26:06,044
IT'S TIME FOR "GIRLS TALK."

583
00:26:06,845 --> 00:26:08,635

ASKED ME TO MOVE IN WITH HIM.

617

IT'S LIKE STRESSING ME OUT.

639
00:28:06,669 --> 00:28:08,235
MY ANXIETY IS THROUGH THE ROOF.

640

DON'T DO THAT, DON'T DO THAT.

1147
00:45:34,097 --> 00:45:37,040
I HATE HOW NEW YORKERS TALK
ABOUT WHERE I'M FROM.

1148
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:39,311
EVERY TIME I TELL A NEW YORKER
I'M FROM TEXAS,

1149
00:45:39,311 --> 00:45:41,931
THEY APOLOGIZE
TO ME LIKE I FOUGHT IN A WAR.

1150
00:45:41,931 --> 00:45:46,222
EVERY TIME, OH MY GOD, I'M SO
SORRY THAT HAPPENED TO YOU.
TOUCH LIKE THAT.

1151
00:45:46,222 --> 00:45:47,848
TEXAS ISN'T A PERFECT PLACE

1152
00:45:47,848 --> 00:45:50,524
BUT EVERY TIME I STEP OUTSIDE MY
APARTMENT IN NEW YORK

1153
00:45:50,524 --> 00:45:53,188
I SEE THE
WORST THING I'VE EVER SEEN IN MY
LIFE.

1154
00:45:53,188 --> 00:45:56,035
THAT'S A NORMAL THING TO SEE,
ALL RIGHT?

1155
00:45:56,035 --> 00:46:00,222
LIKE ONE TIME I SAW A KID GET
INTO A FISTFIGHT WITH A BIRD.

1156
00:46:00,222 --> 00:46:02,702
AND THE BIRD WAS WINNING.

1157
00:46:02,702 --> 00:46:04,909
I TOLD MY HOMIE HE WAS FROM THE
NEIGHBORHOOD,

1158
00:46:04,909 --> 00:46:07,315
"OH, THAT'S JUST
MIKE."
THAT'S WHAT HE SAID.

1159
00:46:07,315 --> 00:46:10,458
I DIDN'T KNOW IF HE WAS TALKING
ABOUT THE KID OR THE BIRD.

1160
00:46:10,458 --> 00:46:14,437
YOU SAW THAT IN TEXAS, THEY'D
SHUT TEXAS DOWN FOR.

1161
00:46:14,437 --> 00:46:18,809
NOBODY WOULD GO TO SCHOOL OR
ANYTHING, THEY'D HANG OUT AT
HOME UNTIL THE VIBES GOT RIGHT
AGAIN.

1162
00:46:18,809 --> 00:46:21,656
>> I'M SURE YOU'LL START TO FIT
IN.

1163
00:46:21,656 --> 00:46:25,230
>> CAN I ASK THE AUDIENCE A
QUESTION?

1164
00:46:25,230 --> 00:46:26,751
>> OKAY.

1165
00:46:26,751 --> 00:46:29,525
>> HEY, GUYS.
Y'ALL THINK I LOOK LIKE A
CATCALLER?

1166
00:46:29,525 --> 00:46:32,437
>> YEAH!
>> NO!

1167
00:46:34,163 --> 00:46:37,787
>> I DON'T THINK I LOOK LIKE
ONE.
BUT EVER SINCE I MOVED HERE,

1168
00:46:37,787 --> 00:46:40,432
EVERY TIME I SEE A DUDE DOING A CATCALL,

1169
00:46:40,432 --> 00:46:43,091
WE HAVE ON THE EXACT
SAME OUTFIT.

1170
00:46:43,091 --> 00:46:45,077
SOMETIMES I PASS WOMEN ON THE
STREET, THEY GO LIKE THAT.

1171
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:47,546
I KNOW WHY IT HAPPENS.

1172
00:46:47,548 --> 00:46:48,780
I'M A LARGE MAN.

1173
00:46:48,782 --> 00:46:49,214
LARGE MEN BE RESPONSIBLE FOR A

1174
00:46:49,216 --> 00:46:50,215
LOT OF THE BAD THINGS

1175
00:46:50,217 --> 00:46:52,184
HISTORICALLY.

1176
00:46:52,186 --> 00:46:53,418
BUT I'VE BEEN TRYING TO FIGURE

1177
00:46:53,420 --> 00:46:55,153
OUT HOW TO COMMUNICATE TO THESE

1178
00:46:55,155 --> 00:46:57,456
WOMEN I'M NOT GOING TO DO

1179
00:46:57,458 --> 00:47:00,092
ANYTHING WEIRD, SO ANY TIME ONE

1180
00:47:00,094 --> 00:47:00,859
TRIES TO AVOID ME, I'VE BEEN

1181
00:47:00,861 --> 00:47:01,260
"HEY, BABY GIRL, DON'T WORRY"

1182
00:47:01,262 --> 00:47:02,461
ABOUT IT, I'M REGULAR."

1183
00:47:04,365 --> 00:47:06,431
>> WHY ARE YOU WHISPERING?

1184
00:47:06,433 --> 00:47:06,765
>> I DON'T KNOW, MY BODY'S BIG,

1185
00:47:06,767 --> 00:47:08,767
I'M TRYING TO MAKE MY VOICE

1186
00:47:08,769 --> 00:47:10,235
LITTLE.

1187
00:47:10,237 --> 00:47:11,436
>> YOU MIGHT BE OVERTHINKING IT.

1188
00:47:11,438 --> 00:47:12,604
>> I DON'T THINK I AM.

1189
00:47:12,606 --> 00:47:13,705
WATCH THIS.

1190
00:47:13,707 --> 00:47:19,411
HEY, REAL QUICK, WHERE ARE MY

1191
00:47:19,413 --> 00:47:20,245
STRAIGHT BOYS AT?

1192
00:47:23,651 --> 00:47:25,584
YEAH, MORALE IS REAL LOW RIGHT

1193
00:47:25,586 --> 00:47:27,653
NOW, ALL RIGHT?

1194
00:47:27,655 --> 00:47:28,020
ODD TO ASK THAT QUESTION IN 19

1195
00:47:28,022 --> 00:47:29,454
THINGS, THE BUILDING WOULD HAVE

1196
00:47:29,456 --> 00:47:31,123
EXPLODED.

1197
00:47:31,125 --> 00:47:33,091
30 ROCK WOULD BE GONE BECAUSE

1198
00:47:33,093 --> 00:47:33,392
THE HETERO BOYS BROUGHT IT DOWN.

1199
00:47:33,394 --> 00:47:34,826
WE GET A LOT OF BAD PRESS RIGHT

1200
00:47:34,828 --> 00:47:36,094
NOW.

1201
00:47:36,096 --> 00:47:37,095
A LOT OF BAD PRESS.

1202
00:47:37,097 --> 00:47:37,930
I THINK WE CAN CHANGE IT.

1203
00:47:37,932 --> 00:47:39,131
I THINK CULTURE SHIFT, THAT'S

1204
00:47:39,133 --> 00:47:39,898
WHAT WE NEED.

1205
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:42,901
I THINK ALL OF US NEED TO TRY TO

1206
00:47:42,903 --> 00:47:43,902
BE A LITTLE BIT MORE GAY.

1207
00:47:45,306 --> 00:47:47,105
>> SAY WHAT?

1208
00:47:47,107 --> 00:47:48,006
>> I SAID WHAT I SAID, MICHAEL,

1209
00:47:48,008 --> 00:47:50,409
ALL RIGHT?

1210
00:47:50,411 --> 00:47:52,611
OUR CULTURE IS BAD, WE NEED A

1211
00:47:52,613 --> 00:47:53,445
SHIFT, EVERY SINGLE YEAR 37 OF

1212
00:47:53,447 --> 00:47:54,146
MY HOMIES INVITE ME TO BE IN A

1213
00:47:54,148 --> 00:47:55,380
FANTASY FOOTBALL LEAGUE.

1214
00:47:55,382 --> 00:47:56,048
I DON'T THINK THE STRAIGHT

1215
00:47:56,050 --> 00:47:56,448
COMMUNITY KNOWS WE DON'T HAVE SO

1216
00:47:56,450 --> 00:47:57,983
DO THAT.

1217
00:48:00,220 --> 00:48:02,287
