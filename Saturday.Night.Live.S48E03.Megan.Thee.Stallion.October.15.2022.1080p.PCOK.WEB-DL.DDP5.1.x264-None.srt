1
00:00:01,133 --> 00:00:03,291
C-SPAN

2
00:00:03,291 --> 00:00:06,025
CAN YOU BELIEVE
COOKER SPANIEL

3
00:00:06,025 --> 00:00:09,487
IN THE CLOSING
STATEMENTS OF THE JANUARY 6th COMMITTEE

4
00:00:09,487 --> 00:00:12,555
TO INVESTIGATE THE
ATTACK ON THE NATION'S CAPITOL.

5
00:00:18,902 --> 00:00:23,772
>> ALL RIGHT.
WE HAVE TO LET THE COMMITTEE COME TO ORDER

6
00:00:23,772 --> 00:00:25,717
FOR ITS NINTH AND
FINAL HEARING.

7
00:00:25,717 --> 00:00:28,711
THE JANUARY 6th WAS ONE OF THE
MOST DRAMATIC

8
00:00:28,711 --> 00:00:31,410
AND CONSEQUENTIAL
MOMENTS IN OUR NATION'S HISTORY.

9
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:37,108
SO TO FIGHT BACK, WE ASSEMBLED A
TEAM OF MONOTONE NERDS TO DO A
POWERPOINT.

10
00:00:37,108 --> 00:00:39,969
>> I DID MINE WITH GOOGLE FLY.

11
00:00:39,969 --> 00:00:43,419
>> WE'VE BEEN INVESTIGATING THIS
HORRIBLE ATTACK FOR MORE THAN A YEAR,

12
00:00:43,419 --> 00:00:45,677
BUT TODAY'S SESSION IS
GOING TO BE A LITTLE DIFFERENT.

13
00:00:45,677 --> 00:00:50,004
WE'RE GOING TO SUMMARIZE OUR
FINDINGS, HOLD A HISTORY-MAKING VOTE,

14
00:00:50,004 --> 00:00:52,746
AND THEN, AND ONLY THEN --

15
00:00:52,746 --> 00:00:56,482
WE ALL GET TO HAVE A LITTLE
TREAT.

16
00:00:56,482 --> 00:01:00,404
>> AW, COME ON, CAN'T I HAVE ONE
CUPCAKE NOW?

17
00:01:00,404 --> 00:01:03,108
>> NO, NO, NO, NO.
IT'S EVIDENCE,

18
00:01:03,108 --> 00:01:06,242
THEN A VOTE, THEN
A LITTLE TREAT.

19
00:01:06,242 --> 00:01:10,365
ALL RIGHT, I WOULD FIRST LIKE TO
RECOGNIZE THE GENTLE LADY FROM WYOMING

20
00:01:10,365 --> 00:01:13,985
WHO I AM SHOCKED TO SAY
HAS BECOME MY BEST FRIEND.

21
00:01:13,985 --> 00:01:16,370
LIZ CHENEY.

22
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:18,955
>> THANK YOU, BENNIE.

23
00:01:18,955 --> 00:01:22,370
OVER THE PAST FEW MONTHS, THIS
BIPARTISAN COMMITTEE

24
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:25,106
HAS
PRESENTED OUR CASE TO ALL
AMERICANS.

25
00:01:25,106 --> 00:01:27,744
WHETHER YOU'RE A REPUBLICAN
WHO'S NOT WATCHING,

26
00:01:27,744 --> 00:01:32,047
OR A
DEMOCRAT WHO'S NODDING SO HARD
YOUR HEAD IS FALLING OFF --

27
00:01:32,047 --> 00:01:36,378
ONE PERSON IS RESPONSIBLE FOR
THIS INSURRECTION, DONALD TRUMP.

28
00:01:36,378 --> 00:01:40,625
AND ONE PERSON WILL SUFFER THE
CONSEQUENCES, ME.

29
00:01:40,625 --> 00:01:43,897
YOU MIGHT BE WONDERING WHAT
MAKES ME SO TOUGH.

30
00:01:43,897 --> 00:01:47,391
AND I ASK YOU, WHO IS YOUR DAD?

31
00:01:47,391 --> 00:01:49,837
IS IT DICK CHENEY?

32
00:01:49,837 --> 00:01:55,176
YOU MIGHT WONDER, WHEN YOU HAVE
THE GUTS TO TAKE ON YOUR ENTIRE
PARTY ALONE.

33
00:01:55,176 --> 00:01:59,610
I SAY, WHEN YOU WERE LITTLE, WHO
TUCKED YOU IN AT NIGHT?

34
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:02,414
WAS IT DICK CHENEY?

35
00:02:02,414 --> 00:02:06,108
I'VE BEEN ASKED, HOW DID YOU GET
A BACKBONE MADE OF STEEL?

36
00:02:06,108 --> 00:02:08,875
AND I ASK BACK, FOR YOUR 10th BIRTHDAY,

37
00:02:08,875 --> 00:02:12,396
DID YOU EAT PIZZA AT
CHUCK E. CHEESE WITH ALL YOUR
FRIENDS?

38
00:02:12,396 --> 00:02:15,737
OR DID YOU SHOOT A DEER IN THE
FACE WITH DICK CHENEY?

39
00:02:15,737 --> 00:02:21,491
SO YEAH, I GUESS YOU COULD SAY I
HAVE BIG DICK CHENEY ENERGY.

40
00:02:21,491 --> 00:02:25,857
>> WELL.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH, GENTLE LADY
FROM WYOMING.

41
00:02:25,857 --> 00:02:29,247
THE CHAIR NOW RECOGNIZES THE
GENTLEMAN FROM CALIFORNIA,

42
00:02:29,247 --> 00:02:33,040
AND
MAYBE THE HORROR MOVIE SMILE?

43
00:02:35,367 --> 00:02:38,449
ACTUALLY, NO, NO, NO, WE GONNA
SKIP HIM.

44
00:02:38,528 --> 00:02:39,692
TOO SPOOKY.

45
00:02:39,692 --> 00:02:43,879
ALL RIGHT.
THE CHAIR INSTEAD RECOGNIZES THE
GENTLEMAN FROM MARYLAND.

46
00:02:43,879 --> 00:02:46,108
>> THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN.

47
00:02:46,108 --> 00:02:48,454
LEADING UP TO JANUARY 6th,

48
00:02:48,454 --> 00:02:52,401
THE FBI SCOURED
THROUGH ALT-RIGHT MESSAGE BOARDS

49
00:02:52,401 --> 00:02:55,939
AND FOUND
DISTURBING COMMENTS LIKE,

50
00:02:55,939 --> 00:02:59,211
WHO
WANTS TO BURN D.C. TO THE
GROUND?

51
00:02:59,211 --> 00:03:05,420
ANYONE GOT ROOM IN THEIR CAR FOR
ME, 10 RIFLES AND 30 SNAKES?

52
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:08,144
WHERE DO WE PARK?

53
00:03:08,144 --> 00:03:13,770
IS THERE A SHUTTLE FROM LA
QUINTA INN TO COUP?

54
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:19,335
AM I AT WRONG WASHINGTON?
I SEE SPACE NEEDLE.

55
00:03:19,335 --> 00:03:24,248
YET AGAIN, PRESIDENT TRUMP
DIDN'T RAISE A FINGER.

56
00:03:24,248 --> 00:03:29,302
AND WHILE THESE HOOLIGANS WERE
RANSACKING OUR BELOVED CAPITOL,

57
00:03:29,302 --> 00:03:33,693
REAL LEADERS LIKE NANCY PELOSI
AND CHUCK SCHUMER

58
00:03:33,693 --> 00:03:38,691
WERE BUNKERED
IN A SENATE HIDE-AWAY TRYING TO
SAVE THE COUNTRY.

59
00:03:38,691 --> 00:03:42,342
>> YES, HELLO, MR. VICE
PRESIDENT.
IT'S SPEAKER PELOSI.

60
00:03:42,342 --> 00:03:44,243
WHAT IS HAPPENING OVER THERE?

61
00:03:44,243 --> 00:03:47,100
CAN WE GET BACK TO THE CAPITOL
AND RESUME THE VOTE

62
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:51,440
IN HELLO,
DOORDASH?
IT'S CHUCK SCHUMER!

63
00:03:51,753 --> 00:03:56,009
YES, WE STILL HAVEN'T RECEIVED
ANY OF OUR LUNCH ORDERS!

64
00:03:56,009 --> 00:04:01,326
DID CHANGE THE DROP-OFF LOCATION, DUE TO
SOME UNFORTUNATE TREASON,

65
00:04:01,326 --> 00:04:03,219
BUT IT
SHOULD HAVE ARRIVED BY NOW.

66
00:04:03,219 --> 00:04:07,413
>> THE PRESIDENT IS DOING
NOTHING, THIS IS COMPLETELY
UNACCEPTABLE.

67
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:11,837
>> MY ORDER?
DILL PICKLES STILL FLOATING IN
THE JUICE

68
00:04:11,837 --> 00:04:13,724
AND A PASTRAMI SANDWICH

69
00:04:13,724 --> 00:04:17,678
WITH VERY LIGHT
MUSTARD, DO YOU HEAR ME?

70
00:04:17,679 --> 00:04:20,412
NEGATIVE REVIEW

71
00:04:20,412 --> 00:04:23,708
I'M IN A CONFINED SPACE WITH 30
PEOPLE.

72
00:04:23,708 --> 00:04:29,485
IF I GET AN UPSET STOMACH, ALL
HELL IS GOING TO BREAK LOOSE.

73
00:04:29,485 --> 00:04:32,896
>> AND IT CONTINUES FOR HOURS
FROM THERE.

74
00:04:32,896 --> 00:04:34,807
>> WELL, THANK YOU, MR. RASKIN.

75
00:04:34,807 --> 00:04:38,368
THE CHAIR NOW RECOGNIZES THE
TENDERONI FROM ILLINOIS.

76
00:04:38,368 --> 00:04:41,552
>> THANK YOU, MR. CHAIR.
I TOOK A CUPCAKE.

77
00:04:41,552 --> 00:04:46,337
NOW, DONALD TRUMP KNEW HE HAD
LOST THE ELECTION.

78
00:04:46,337 --> 00:04:47,759
EVERYONE AROUND HIM KNEW.

79
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:50,698
HE ASKED WHITE HOUSE COUNSEL PAT
CIPOLLONE,

80
00:04:50,698 --> 00:04:52,507
DID I LOSE THE
ELECTION?

81
00:04:52,507 --> 00:04:55,056
AND PAT SAID, YES.

82
00:04:55,056 --> 00:04:57,405
HE THEN ASKED IVANKA.

83
00:04:57,405 --> 00:04:59,717
DID I REALLY LOSE THE ELECTION?

84
00:04:59,717 --> 00:05:02,481
SHE SAID, YES.

85
00:05:02,481 --> 00:05:04,785
HE THEN TRIED A JANITOR.

86
00:05:04,785 --> 00:05:07,549
HEY, YOU DON'T THINK I LOST, DO
YOU?

87
00:05:07,549 --> 00:05:10,778
THE JANITOR RESPONDED, I DO.

88
00:05:10,778 --> 00:05:14,578
THEN THE PRESIDENT TURNED TO A DOG AND SAID,

89
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:17,438
WHAT ABOUT YOU?
DID I WIN?

90
00:05:17,438 --> 00:05:21,365
AND THE DOG LEGIT SHOOK ITS HEAD
SIDE TO SIDE

91
00:05:21,365 --> 00:05:25,047
THEN BARKED A
PERFECT HUMAN "NO."

92
00:05:25,047 --> 00:05:28,485
DONALD WAS DESPERATE TO HANG ON
TO POWER.

93
00:05:28,485 --> 00:05:32,093
MEANWHILE, REAL HEROES LIKE
NANCY PELOSI AND CHUCK SCHUMER

94
00:05:32,093 --> 00:05:34,851
WERE THE ONES ACTUALLY RUNNING
THIS COUNTRY.

95
00:05:34,851 --> 00:05:38,540
>> MR. VICE PRESIDENT, MR. VICE
PRESIDENT, SPEAKER PELOSI AGAIN.

96
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:40,820
TELL THEM I'M HERE TOO.

97
00:05:41,255 --> 00:05:44,250
MR. VICE PRESIDENT, WHERE IS
PRESIDENT TRUMP?

98
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:45,846
WHAT IS HE DOING TO STOP THIS?

99
00:05:45,846 --> 00:05:49,627
>> HI, MIKE, IT'S CHUCK SCHUMER,
I'M HERE AS WELL!

100
00:05:49,627 --> 00:05:53,361
>> LET ME TELL YOU, IF TRUMP
COMES HERE RIGHT NOW, I'M GOING
TO PUNCH HIM RIGHT IN THE FACE.

101
00:05:53,361 --> 00:05:56,069
THEN I'LL BE HAPPY.

102
00:05:56,069 --> 00:06:00,445
>> LET ME TELL YOU, IF TRUMP
COMES, I'M GOING TO LET HIM
PUNCH ME IN THE FACE,

103
00:06:00,445 --> 00:06:03,697
I'LL GO TO
THE HOSPITAL, FREE SOUP.

104
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:08,736
>> NOT SURE IF SCHUMER NEEDS TO
BE IN ALL THESE CLIPS.

105
00:06:08,736 --> 00:06:11,173
MISS CHENEY, ANY FINAL THOUGHTS?

106
00:06:11,173 --> 00:06:15,625
>> THE FACT IS TRUMP PLANNED TO
DECLARE VICTORY NO MATTER THE
RESULTS.

107
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:19,360
LOOK AT THIS VIDEO OF THE
PRESIDENT THE DAY BEFORE THE
ELECTION.

108
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:24,265
>> THE VOTES DON'T MATTER, I'VE
ALWAYS SAID THAT THE VOTES DON'T
MATTER AT ALL.

109
00:06:24,265 --> 00:06:26,286
WHAT EVEN IS A VOTE?

110
00:06:26,286 --> 00:06:31,154
IT'S A PIECE OF PAPER YOU FOLD
UP, PUT IT IN A HAT, A GUY
SHAKES IT AROUND.

111
00:06:31,154 --> 00:06:35,285
HE HAD A GREAT HAT, IT WAS VERY TALL,

112
00:06:35,285 --> 00:06:37,310
HE BORROWED IT FROM APOLLO CREED

113
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:39,896
WHO IS A VERY CLOSE FRIEND OF MINE,

114
00:06:39,896 --> 00:06:42,618
WE TALK ON THE PHONE
EVERY DAY, OUR WIVES ARE
FRIENDS.

115
00:06:42,618 --> 00:06:45,231
HE SHOULD NEVER HAVE DIED IN
THAT RING.

116
00:06:45,231 --> 00:06:49,426
HE GETS WHACKED IN THE HEAD, AND BOOM,

117
00:06:49,426 --> 00:06:51,779
WHERE'S THE OBAMACARE?

118
00:06:51,779 --> 00:06:55,147
NO, WE DON'T VOTE, WE DON'T
VOTE.

119
00:06:55,147 --> 00:06:57,213
IT'S OPEN!

120
00:06:57,213 --> 00:06:59,056
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

121
00:06:59,056 --> 00:07:01,831
IS MIKE PENCE DEAD YET?

122
00:07:01,831 --> 00:07:07,688
>> ALL RIGHT, I THINK WE'VE SEEN
QUITE ENOUGH.

123
00:07:07,688 --> 00:07:10,904
LET US NOW TAKE A VOTE, SHOULD
WE SUBPOENA PRESIDENT TRUMP

124
00:07:10,904 --> 00:07:13,352
AND
FORCE HIM TO TESTIFY BEFORE THIS
COMMITTEE?

125
00:07:13,352 --> 00:07:17,760
>> YES, WE MUST.
AND THIS VOTE IS NOT JUST AN
EMPTY GESTURE.

126
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:19,695
HE WILL TESTIFY.

127
00:07:19,695 --> 00:07:23,315
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
HE WILL GET ON A PLANE

128
00:07:23,315 --> 00:07:26,363
AND LEAVE
FLORIDA, WHERE HE IS BELOVED,

129
00:07:26,363 --> 00:07:30,920
AND HE WILL FLY TO WASHINGTON
WHERE HE IS HATED,

130
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:34,471
AND HE WILL
ANSWER MY QUESTIONS.

131
00:07:34,471 --> 00:07:35,956
QUESTIONS LIKE,

132
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:40,646
HEY! WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE,
MISTER!

133
00:07:40,646 --> 00:07:46,176
>> TRUMP IS 100% COMING AND THIS
TIME HE WILL BE HELD
ACCOUNTABLE.

134
00:07:46,176 --> 00:07:50,959
SURE, HE GOT AWAY WITH A LOT OF
STUFF IN THE '70s, THE '80s, THE '90s,

135
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:55,207
THE EARLY 2000s, THE
2010s, AND THE EARLY 2020S.

136
00:07:55,207 --> 00:07:59,212
BUT THAT ENDS NOW!
WITH US.

137
00:07:59,212 --> 00:08:01,378
BECAUSE I'M --

138
00:08:01,705 --> 00:08:04,666
MR. KINZINGER.

139
00:08:04,666 --> 00:08:07,259
AND HE WILL RESPECT MY
AUTHORITY.

140
00:08:07,259 --> 00:08:11,641
>> ALL RIGHT, WELL, I CAN
ALREADY SEE THIS IS A COMPLETE
ZERO.

141
00:08:11,641 --> 00:08:14,555
I WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUES
FOR THROWING AWAY THEIR SUMMERS,

142
00:08:14,555 --> 00:08:17,805
AND IN SOME CASES THEIR CAREERS,
TO SERVE ON THIS COMMITTEE.

143
00:08:17,805 --> 00:08:20,045
>> HEY NO PROBLEM.
>> MY CALENDAR WAS EMPTY.

144
00:08:20,045 --> 00:08:22,588
>> I DO HAVE A COUPLE OF
REGRETS.

145
00:08:22,588 --> 00:08:26,703
>> AMERICA, I DON'T KNOW WHAT
MORE WE COULD POSSIBLY SHOW YOU

146
00:08:26,703 --> 00:08:30,094
EXCEPT MAYBE THIS CLIP OF NANCY
PELOSI SAYING POO-POO.

147
00:08:30,094 --> 00:08:34,012
>> THERE'S POO-POO.
THERE'S POO HAVE POO ON THE

157
00:11:34,842 --> 00:11:37,588
MOST OF Y'ALL KNOW ME AS MEGAN

158
00:11:37,588 --> 00:11:41,038
BUT IF YOU KNOW ME, THEN YOU
KNOW I GO BY MORE THAN ONE NAME.

159
00:11:41,038 --> 00:11:43,973

HOTTEST EMCEES IN THE GAME RIGHT
NOW!

168
00:12:13,163 --> 00:12:16,143
BUT THERE'S SO MUCH MORE TO ME
THAN MEETS THE EYE.

169
00:12:16,143 --> 00:12:19,505
FOR EXAMPLE, I'M A REALLY GOOD
ACTRESS.

170
00:12:19,505 --> 00:12:24,317
I DON'T WANT TO TOOT MY OWN
HORN, BUT I THINK I DO A PRETTY
GOOD BRITISH ACCENT.

171
00:12:24,317 --> 00:12:26,263

IT'S NOT EASY

175
00:12:42,801 --> 00:12:46,420
AND I DID THAT
WHILE GOING ON A WORLD TOUR.

176
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:49,272
SO NOW I CAN GO BY ANOTHER NAME.

SWEETS.

ADMINISTRATION BECAUSE I HAVE
ALWAYS WANTED TO HELP THE PEOPLE
IN MY COMMUNITY.

179
00:12:56,567 --> 00:13:00,665
I BELIEVE THAT IT IS IMPORTANT

THAT'S A REAL WEBSITE.

184
00:13:14,096 --> 00:13:17,183
I CAN'T BELIEVE THE DOMAIN
WASN'T ALREADY TAKEN.

185
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:22,494
IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE CALLED,
HOTGIRLBUMMER BUT SOMEBODY STOLE
IT.

186
00:13:22,494 --> 00:13:24,845
YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE.

187
00:13:24,845 --> 00:13:29,332
BEFORE THE SHOW STARTS, THERE'S
SOMETHING I'VE BEEN REALLY
WANTING TO SAY.

188
00:13:29,332 --> 00:13:32,178
I'VE HAD SOME WINS AND I'VE HAD SOME LOSSES

189
00:13:32,178 --> 00:13:34,254
AND I ALWAYS GET
MORE WINS.

190
00:13:34,254 --> 00:13:36,771
BUT I DO PRIDE MYSELF ON BEING
AN OPEN BOOK.

191
00:13:36,771 --> 00:13:40,527
SO WITH THAT BEING SAID, I WOULD
LIKE TO ADDRESS A CERTAIN

195
00:13:53,599 --> 00:13:57,040

00:22:47,982 --> 00:22:48,715
WITH YOUR EYES TO THE DEER.

481
00:22:48,717 --> 00:22:50,122
>> I SAID IT'S OKAY, I DON'T

482
00:22:50,124 --> 00:22:53,193
REALLY CARE.

483
00:22:53,195 --> 00:22:55,336
>> BUT IT'S RIGHT THERE.

484
00:22:55,338 --> 00:22:59,175
JUST MAKE YOUR EYES GO IN MINE

485
00:22:59,177 --> 00:23:00,326
WITH THE ANGLE OF MY POINT.

486
00:23:00,328 --> 00:23:03,365
>> FORGET, I I DON'T NEED TO SEE

487
00:23:03,367 --> 00:23:04,069
NO DEER!

488
00:23:04,071 --> 00:23:04,389
>> THERE'S A BLOODY RABBIT

489
00:23:04,391 --> 00:23:08,132
RIDING ON THE BACK OF THE DEER!

490
00:23:08,134 --> 00:23:08,515
>> WHAT?

491
00:23:08,517 --> 00:23:12,193
WHERE'S THAT HAPPENING NOW?

492
00:23:13,763 --> 00:23:14,945
>> OH, AND THE BUNNY HAS A TAIL.

493
00:23:14,947 --> 00:23:16,224
>> IF I WANTED TO SEE THAT,

494
00:23:16,226 --> 00:23:16,640
WHERE EXACTLY I WOULD LOOK?

495
00:23:16,642 --> 00:23:18,367
>> IT'S WALKING STRAIGHT TOWARDS

496
00:23:18,369 --> 00:23:19,391
US, SEE?

497
00:23:19,393 --> 00:23:20,062
>> DAD, IMAGINE A LASER COMING

498
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:24,125
FROM MY FINGERS.

499
00:23:24,127 --> 00:23:24,860
>> WHAT?

500
00:23:24,862 --> 00:23:26,716
>> DO YOU SEE THE THIRD CLOUD ON

501
00:23:26,718 --> 00:23:27,707
THE SIDE OF THE SKY?

502
00:23:27,709 --> 00:23:30,362
>> THE SIDE OF THE SKY?

503
00:23:30,364 --> 00:23:30,650
>> RIGHT THERE AT 12:00.

504
00:23:30,652 --> 00:23:32,314
>> EAST COAST OR WEST COAST

505
00:23:32,316 --> 00:23:33,497
TIME?

506
00:23:33,499 --> 00:23:34,681
>> LOOK, THE DEER'S RIGHT THERE,

507
00:23:34,683 --> 00:23:34,937
YOU HAVE TO SEE IT.

508
00:23:34,939 --> 00:23:36,215
>> BUT I DON'T, AND I DON'T WANT

509
00:23:36,217 --> 00:23:36,696
TO.

510
00:23:36,698 --> 00:23:38,647
>> SHOOT, I THINK Y'ALL ARE

511
00:23:38,649 --> 00:23:39,414
MAKING THIS UP.

512
00:23:39,416 --> 00:23:41,078
>> ALL RIGHT, DADDY, IT'S OKAY.

513
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:42,006
LET'S TALK ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE.

514
00:23:42,008 --> 00:23:44,629
>> YEAH, IT'S NOT THAT GREAT OF

515
00:23:44,631 --> 00:23:48,946
A DEER.

516
00:23:48,948 --> 00:23:49,779
>> OH MY GOD, IS THAT THE ONE ON

517
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:51,217
MR. REYNOLDS'S WALK?

518
00:23:51,219 --> 00:23:51,506
>> I WILL NOT.

519
00:23:51,508 --> 00:23:52,177
I HAVE LOST ALL INTEREST IN THE

520
00:23:52,179 --> 00:23:55,376
DEER.

521
00:23:55,378 --> 00:23:55,760
>> IT'S RIGHT THERE WAVING AT

522
00:23:55,761 --> 00:23:57,039
US!

523
00:23:57,745 --> 00:23:59,119
>> I DON'T CARE IF IT'S DOING

524
00:23:59,121 --> 00:24:00,686
THE MACARENA.

525
00:24:00,688 --> 00:24:01,006
>> FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, JUST

526
00:24:01,008 --> 00:24:02,574
TURN AROUND AND YOU'LL SEE IT!

527
00:24:02,576 --> 00:24:07,819
>> OKAY.

528
00:24:07,821 --> 00:24:08,459
FINE.

529
00:24:08,461 --> 00:24:08,971
BUT IT BETTER BE THERE.

530
00:24:08,973 --> 00:24:10,634
>> OH!

531
00:24:10,636 --> 00:24:11,113
>> OH!

532
00:24:11,115 --> 00:24:13,225
>> I'M GOING TO BURN THIS WHOLE

533
00:24:13,227 --> 00:24:13,865
HOUSE DOWN.

534
00:24:13,867 --> 00:24:15,240
>> IT WAS RIGHT THERE, IT JUST

535
00:24:15,242 --> 00:24:16,616
JUMPED DOWN.

536
00:24:16,618 --> 00:24:18,119
>> Y'ALL ARE MESSING WITH ME,

537
00:24:18,121 --> 00:24:19,302
JUST LIKE WHEN YOU PULLED MY

538
00:24:19,304 --> 00:24:20,742
PANTS DOWN AT THE YANKEE GAME.

539
00:24:20,744 --> 00:24:21,414
>> I DIDN'T PULL YOUR PANTS

540
00:24:21,416 --> 00:24:22,085
DOWN, THEY WERE LOOSE, THEY FELL

541
00:24:22,087 --> 00:24:22,789
ON THEIR OWN.

542
00:24:22,791 --> 00:24:23,045
>> WHATEVER.

543
00:24:23,047 --> 00:24:26,467
EVERYBODY ALWAYS MESSING WITH

544
00:24:26,469 --> 00:24:28,963
ME.

545
00:24:28,965 --> 00:24:31,010
>> OH MY GOD!

546
00:24:31,012 --> 00:24:32,257
>> OH MY GOD, DEER IN THE HOUSE!

547
00:24:32,259 --> 00:24:32,545
>> I DON'T WANT TO MEET HER.

548
00:24:32,547 --> 00:24:34,593
I DON'T WANT TO HEAR ABOUT NO

549
00:24:34,595 --> 00:24:35,040
DEER.

550
00:24:35,042 --> 00:24:35,936
>> RIGHT BEHIND YOU!

551
00:24:35,938 --> 00:24:37,855
>> HUGH?

552
00:24:37,857 --> 00:24:40,606
WHO IS HUGH?

553
00:24:40,608 --> 00:24:42,205
>> NOT HUGH, YOU.

554
00:24:42,207 --> 00:24:42,493
>> ME, STOP MESSING WITH ME.

555
00:24:42,495 --> 00:24:42,813
>> MR. REYNOLDS, IT'S GOT A

556
00:24:42,815 --> 00:24:47,387
KNIFE!

557
00:24:47,389 --> 00:24:49,691
>> WHAT?

558
00:24:50,204 --> 00:24:50,938

00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:51,610
US!

560
00:24:51,612 --> 00:24:53,496
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

561
00:24:53,498 --> 00:24:54,137
PACK YOUR BAGS, GIRL.

562
00:24:54,139 --> 00:24:55,480
YOU'RE MOVING BACK TO THE CITY.

563

566
00:25:01,431 --> 00:25:04,245
NO, DADDY.

567
00:25:04,247 --> 00:25:07,283
WE LOVE IT OUT HERE.

568
00:25:08,244 --> 00:25:08,883
I KNOW YOU WORRY ABOUT ME, BUT I

569
00:25:08,885 --> 00:25:11,633
PROMISE WE GOING TO BE OKAY.

570
00:25:11,635 --> 00:25:12,721
>> WELL, I DO WORRY.

571
00:25:12,723 --> 00:25:13,777
MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT.

572
00:25:13,779 --> 00:25:15,024
MAYBE MY BABY GIRL --

573
00:25:15,026 --> 00:25:16,271

MR. REYNOLDS, THE DEER'S PULLING

THE TEA IS HOT AND THE BRAS ARE

580
00:25:57,729 --> 00:26:03,036
OFF.

581
00:26:03,038 --> 00:26:06,044
IT'S TIME FOR "GIRLS TALK."

582
00:26:06,845 --> 00:26:08,635

ASKED ME TO MOVE IN WITH HIM.

616

IT'S LIKE STRESSING ME OUT.

638
00:28:06,669 --> 00:28:08,235
MY ANXIETY IS THROUGH THE ROOF.

639

METH HIDDEN INSIDE PUMPKINS.

THEY COULD TELL THE PUMPKINS

YOU DIGGING NEW YORK?

>> NOT REALLY.

1175
00:46:35,393 --> 00:46:36,158
IF I'M BEING HONEST, I THINK NEW

1176
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:37,026
YORK'S A LITTLE OVERRATED.

1177
00:46:37,028 --> 00:46:37,894
>> WOW.

1178
00:46:37,896 --> 00:46:38,194

DON'T DO THAT, DON'T DO THAT.

1183
00:46:48,506 --> 00:46:49,572
I HATE HOW NEW YORKERS TALK

1184
00:46:49,574 --> 00:46:51,240
ABOUT WHERE I'M FROM.

1185
00:46:51,242 --> 00:46:53,276
EVERY TIME I TELL A NEW YORKER

1186
00:46:53,278 --> 00:46:55,845
I'M FROM TEXAS, THEY APOLOGIZE

1187
00:46:55,847 --> 00:46:56,546
TO ME LIKE I FOUGHT IN A WAR.

1188
00:46:56,548 --> 00:46:57,380
EVERY TIME, OH MY GOD, I'M SO

1189
00:46:57,382 --> 00:47:00,550
SORRY THAT HAPPENED TO YOU.

1190
00:47:00,552 --> 00:47:01,250
TOUCH LIKE THAT.

1191
00:47:01,252 --> 00:47:02,151
TEXAS ISN'T A PERFECT PLACE BUT

1192
00:47:02,153 --> 00:47:03,619
EVERY TIME I STEP OUTSIDE MY

1193
00:47:03,621 --> 00:47:05,421
APARTMENT IN NEW YORK, I SEE THE

1194
00:47:05,423 --> 00:47:05,821
WORST THING I'VE EVER SEEN IN MY

1195

LIFE.

1196
00:47:06,925 --> 00:47:08,157
THAT'S A NORMAL THING TO SEE,

1197
00:47:08,159 --> 00:47:10,626
ALL RIGHT?

1198
00:47:10,628 --> 00:47:11,027
LIKE ONE TIME I SAW A KID GET

1199
00:47:11,029 --> 00:47:11,661
INTO A FISTFIGHT WITH A BIRD.

1200
00:47:13,064 --> 00:47:18,601
AND THE BIRD WAS WINNING.

1201
00:47:20,138 --> 00:47:20,436
I TOLD MY HOMIE HE WAS FROM THE

1202
00:47:20,438 --> 00:47:21,070
NEIGHBORHOOD, "OH, THAT'S JUST

1203
00:47:21,072 --> 00:47:22,805
MIKE."

1204
00:47:22,807 --> 00:47:23,806
THAT'S WHAT HE SAID.

1205
00:47:23,808 --> 00:47:26,609
I DIDN'T KNOW IF HE WAS TALKING

1206
00:47:26,611 --> 00:47:27,143
ABOUT THE KID OR THE BIRD.

1207
00:47:27,145 --> 00:47:30,112
YOU SAW THAT IN TEXAS, THEY'D

1208
00:47:30,114 --> 00:47:30,813
SHUT TEXAS DOWN FOR.

1209
00:47:30,815 --> 00:47:32,882
NOBODY WOULD GO TO SCHOOL OR

1210
00:47:32,884 --> 00:47:33,215
ANYTHING, THEY'D HANG OUT AT

1211
00:47:33,217 --> 00:47:34,650
HOME UNTIL THE VIBES GOT RIGHT

1212
00:47:34,652 --> 00:47:34,917
AGAIN.

1213
00:47:34,919 --> 00:47:36,352
>> I'M SURE YOU'LL START TO FIT

1214
00:47:36,354 --> 00:47:36,719
IN.

1215
00:47:36,721 --> 00:47:37,086
>> CAN I ASK THE AUDIENCE A

1216
00:47:37,088 --> 00:47:37,987
QUESTION?

1217
00:47:37,989 --> 00:47:40,656
>> OKAY.

1218
00:47:40,658 --> 00:47:43,459
>> HEY, GUYS.

1219
00:47:43,461 --> 00:47:44,060
Y'ALL THINK I LOOK LIKE A

1220
00:47:44,062 --> 00:47:44,961
CATCALLER?

1221
00:47:44,963 --> 00:47:46,162
>> YEAH!

1222
00:47:46,164 --> 00:47:46,429
>> NO!

1223
00:47:46,431 --> 00:47:49,165
>> I DON'T THINK I LOOK LIKE

1224
00:47:49,167 --> 00:47:51,634
ONE.

1225
00:47:51,636 --> 00:47:52,501
BUT EVER SINCE I MOVED HERE,

1226
00:47:52,503 --> 00:47:53,369
EVERY TIME I SEE A DUDE DOING A

1227
00:47:54,539 --> 00:47:55,538
CATCALL, WE HAVE ON THE EXACT

1228
00:47:55,540 --> 00:47:56,505
SAME OUTFIT.

1229
00:47:57,141 --> 00:48:00,242
SOMETIMES I PASS WOMEN ON THE

1230
00:48:00,244 --> 00:48:01,177
STREET, THEY GO LIKE THAT.

1231
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:03,646
I KNOW WHY IT HAPPENS.

1232
00:48:03,648 --> 00:48:04,880
I'M A LARGE MAN.

1233
00:48:04,882 --> 00:48:05,314
LARGE MEN BE RESPONSIBLE FOR A

1234
00:48:05,316 --> 00:48:06,315
LOT OF THE BAD THINGS

1235
00:48:06,317 --> 00:48:08,284
HISTORICALLY.

1236
00:48:08,286 --> 00:48:09,518
BUT I'VE BEEN TRYING TO FIGURE

1237
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:11,253
OUT HOW TO COMMUNICATE TO THESE

1238
00:48:11,255 --> 00:48:13,556
WOMEN I'M NOT GOING TO DO

1239
00:48:13,558 --> 00:48:16,192
ANYTHING WEIRD, SO ANY TIME ONE

1240
00:48:16,194 --> 00:48:16,959
TRIES TO AVOID ME, I'VE BEEN

1241
00:48:16,961 --> 00:48:17,360
"HEY, BABY GIRL, DON'T WORRY"

1242
00:48:17,362 --> 00:48:18,561
ABOUT IT, I'M REGULAR."

1243
00:48:20,465 --> 00:48:22,531
>> WHY ARE YOU WHISPERING?

1244
00:48:22,533 --> 00:48:22,865
>> I DON'T KNOW, MY BODY'S BIG,

1245
00:48:22,867 --> 00:48:24,867
I'M TRYING TO MAKE MY VOICE

1246
00:48:24,869 --> 00:48:26,335
LITTLE.

1247
00:48:26,337 --> 00:48:27,536
>> YOU MIGHT BE OVERTHINKING IT.

1248
00:48:27,538 --> 00:48:28,704
>> I DON'T THINK I AM.

1249
00:48:28,706 --> 00:48:29,805
WATCH THIS.

1250
00:48:29,807 --> 00:48:35,511
HEY, REAL QUICK, WHERE ARE MY

1251
00:48:35,513 --> 00:48:36,345
STRAIGHT BOYS AT?

1252
00:48:39,751 --> 00:48:41,684
YEAH, MORALE IS REAL LOW RIGHT

1253
00:48:41,686 --> 00:48:43,753
NOW, ALL RIGHT?

1254
00:48:43,755 --> 00:48:44,120
ODD TO ASK THAT QUESTION IN 19

1255
00:48:44,122 --> 00:48:45,554
THINGS, THE BUILDING WOULD HAVE

1256
00:48:45,556 --> 00:48:47,223
EXPLODED.

1257
00:48:47,225 --> 00:48:49,191
30 ROCK WOULD BE GONE BECAUSE

1258
00:48:49,193 --> 00:48:49,492
THE HETERO BOYS BROUGHT IT DOWN.

1259
00:48:49,494 --> 00:48:50,926
WE GET A LOT OF BAD PRESS RIGHT

1260
00:48:50,928 --> 00:48:52,194
NOW.

1261
00:48:52,196 --> 00:48:53,195
A LOT OF BAD PRESS.

1262
00:48:53,197 --> 00:48:54,030
I THINK WE CAN CHANGE IT.

1263
00:48:54,032 --> 00:48:55,231
I THINK CULTURE SHIFT, THAT'S

1264
00:48:55,233 --> 00:48:55,998
WHAT WE NEED.

1265
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:59,001
I THINK ALL OF US NEED TO TRY TO

1266
00:48:59,003 --> 00:49:00,002
BE A LITTLE BIT MORE GAY.

1267
00:49:01,406 --> 00:49:03,205
>> SAY WHAT?

1268
00:49:03,207 --> 00:49:04,106
>> I SAID WHAT I SAID, MICHAEL,

1269
00:49:04,108 --> 00:49:06,509
ALL RIGHT?

1270
00:49:06,511 --> 00:49:08,711
OUR CULTURE IS BAD, WE NEED A

1271
00:49:08,713 --> 00:49:09,545
SHIFT, EVERY SINGLE YEAR 37 OF

1272
00:49:09,547 --> 00:49:10,246
MY HOMIES INVITE ME TO BE IN A

1273
00:49:10,248 --> 00:49:11,480
FANTASY FOOTBALL LEAGUE.

1274
00:49:11,482 --> 00:49:12,148
I DON'T THINK THE STRAIGHT

1275
00:49:12,150 --> 00:49:12,548
COMMUNITY KNOWS WE DON'T HAVE SO

1276
00:49:12,550 --> 00:49:14,083
DO THAT.

1277
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:18,387
I WANT MY BROTHERS TO BE FREE.

1278

1292
00:50:13,711 --> 00:50:14,777
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M ABOUT TO SAY.

1293
00:50:14,779 --> 00:50:15,811
>> FAT ASS!

1294
00:50:15,813 --> 00:50:18,914
>> ALL RIGHT, NOW.

1295
00:50:18,916 --> 00:50:19,181
IT'S TIME TO SWEAT.

1296
00:50:19,183 --> 00:50:21,317
LET'S START OFF IN A SQUAT AND

1297

1298

AND SQUAT AND POP.

1299
00:50:24,455 --> 00:50:28,724
NOW REMEMBER, WITH A BIG ASS

1300
00:50:28,726 --> 00:50:33,829
COMES BIG RESPONSIBILITIES.

1301
00:50:33,831 --> 00:50:34,797
IF YOU NEED A MODIFIED VERSION,

1302
00:50:34,799 --> 00:50:37,099
TRAIN YOUR EYES TO KEELY KAY.

1303
00:50:37,101 --> 00:50:39,201
>> THAT'S RIGHT, ANYBODY LOOKING

NOT TO GET A BUTT, LOOK OUR WAY.

THAT'S KEELY, THAT'S KALIE KAY,

WE DON'T HAVE BUTTS.
