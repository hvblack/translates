00:00:02,926 --> 00:00:04,689
>>> ladies and gentlemen,

2
00:00:04,689 --> 00:00:08,200
the ukrainian chorus of new york.

3
00:01:42,614 --> 00:01:46,401
>>> live from new york, it's
Saturday night.

4
00:03:45,787 --> 00:03:50,983
>>  MUSICAL GUEST,
LCD SOUNDSYSTEM.

5
00:03:50,983 --> 00:03:55,073
AND YOUR HOST, JOHN MULANEY.

6
00:03:58,664 --> 00:04:03,411
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
JOHN MULANEY!

7
00:04:24,766 --> 00:04:28,006
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

8
00:04:28,006 --> 00:04:32,470
IT IS AMAZING TO BE HERE HOSTING
"SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE"
FOR THE
FIFTH TIME.

9
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:33,996
I THANK YOU.

10
00:04:36,053 --> 00:04:40,204
FOR MANY, MANY REASONS, I'M
GRATEFUL TO BE HERE TONIGHT.

11
00:04:40,204 --> 00:04:44,121
AFTER A VERY COMPLICATED YEAR,
IT IS WONDERFUL TO BE IN A PLACE

12
00:04:44,121 --> 00:04:48,261
THAT HAS ALWAYS
EMPHASIZED SOBRIETY AND MENTAL
HEALTH.

13
00:04:48,261 --> 00:04:52,877
SINCE I LAST HOSTED, DIFFERENT
THINGS HAVE HAPPENED.

14
00:04:52,877 --> 00:04:56,951
I -- IN DECEMBER OF 2020,

15
00:04:56,951 --> 00:04:59,714
I WENT TO DINNER AT A FRIEND'S
APARTMENT.

16
00:04:59,714 --> 00:05:01,731
BUT IT WAS NOT DINNER.

17
00:05:01,731 --> 00:05:06,505
IT WAS AN INTERVENTION.
FOR ME.

18
00:05:06,505 --> 00:05:09,631
MY LEAST FAVORITE KIND OF
INTERVENTION.

19
00:05:09,631 --> 00:05:12,385
WHEN I WALKED IN TO MY INTERVENTION,

20
00:05:12,385 --> 00:05:15,593
I KNEW RIGHT AWAY
THAT IT WAS AN INTERVENTION.

21
00:05:15,593 --> 00:05:19,319
DO YOU KNOW HOW BAD OF A DRUG
PROBLEM YOU HAVE TO HAVE

22
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:23,706
IF WHEN
YOU OPEN A DOOR AND SEE PEOPLE GATHERED,
YOUR FIRST THOUGHT IS,

23
00:05:23,706 --> 00:05:26,153
"THIS IS PROBABLY AN
INTERVENTION ABOUT MY DRUG
PROBLEM"?

24
00:05:26,153 --> 00:05:29,284
THERE IS NO OTHER REASON PEOPLE
WOULD BE BEHIND A DOOR.

25
00:05:29,284 --> 00:05:34,624
I WALK IN.
THERE WERE SIX OF MY FRIENDS IN
NEW YORK IN PERSON

26
00:05:34,624 --> 00:05:38,160
AND SIX OF
MY FRIENDS OVER ZOOM FROM L.A.

27
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,080
AND I KNOW YOU MIGHT BE
THINKING, "HEY, IF THAT WAS ME,
I WOULD'VE BEEN LIKE,

28
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:44,101
"IF YOU'RE
SO WORRIED ABOUT ME, HOW COME
YOU DIDN'T FLY IN?"

29
00:05:44,101 --> 00:05:48,561
DON'T WORRY.
I SAID THAT SEVERAL TIMES.

30
00:05:48,561 --> 00:05:52,629
I RANG THAT BELL AS OFTEN AS
POSSIBLE.

31
00:05:52,629 --> 00:05:56,018
I WENT AWAY TO A REHAB, WHICH
WAS A VERY GOOD EXPERIENCE.

32
00:05:56,018 --> 00:05:57,357
I'M VERY GRATEFUL THAT I WENT.

33
00:05:57,357 --> 00:06:02,102
I WAS THERE FOR TWO MONTHS FROM
DECEMBER TO FEBRUARY 2021.

34
00:06:02,102 --> 00:06:04,862
I WAS THERE DURING JANUARY 6th,
THE INTERCEPTION.

35
00:06:04,862 --> 00:06:07,745
WOULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED ON MY
WATCH.

36
00:06:07,745 --> 00:06:09,978
BECAUSE I WOULD HAVE SEEN TO
IT.

37
00:06:09,978 --> 00:06:14,335
WAS THERE EVER AN INSURRECTION
BEFORE I WENT TO REHAB?
NO.

38
00:06:14,335 --> 00:06:17,988
HAS THERE BEEN ONE SINCE I GOT
OUT?
ABSOLUTELY NOT.

39
00:06:17,988 --> 00:06:19,509
THEY WOULDN'T DARE.

40
00:06:19,509 --> 00:06:22,607
THEY KNOW BABY JAY IS BACK ON
THE STREETS.

41
00:06:23,229 --> 00:06:26,553
LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT ONE THING
YOU DO IN REHAB, OKAY?

42
00:06:26,553 --> 00:06:28,491
YOU SIT DOWN WITH A COUNSELOR

43
00:06:28,491 --> 00:06:32,578
AND YOU DELETE AND BLOCK
ANY DRUG DEALER'S NUMBERS.

44
00:06:32,578 --> 00:06:35,404
IN SOME CASES, YOU REACH OUT TO
DEALERS AND YOU SAY,

45
00:06:35,404 --> 00:06:38,146
"PLEASE
NEVER CONTACT WITH ME AGAIN."

46
00:06:38,146 --> 00:06:40,137
IT'S CALLED "BREAKING UP WITH
YOUR DRUG DEALER."

47
00:06:40,137 --> 00:06:43,066
SO I DID THIS ONE AFTERNOON.
I SAT DOWN WITH A COUNSELOR.

48
00:06:43,066 --> 00:06:45,408
I TEXTED MY MAIN DEALER ARVIN
FIRST.

49
00:06:45,408 --> 00:06:47,000
I SHOULDN'T HAVE SAID HIS NAME.

50
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,353
THAT'S OKAY.
YOU DON'T KNOW HIM.

51
00:06:50,353 --> 00:06:53,266
SO I TEXT ARVIN, AND I SAY,

52
00:06:53,266 --> 00:06:55,699
"HEY, IT'S ME.
I'M DELETING AND BLOCKING YOU.

53
00:06:55,699 --> 00:06:59,086
I'M SOBER NOW.
I'M NEVER GOING TO BUY DRUGS
FROM YOU AGAIN."

54
00:06:59,086 --> 00:07:02,677
AND THEN I'M REALLY POLITE, SO I
DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO END THE TEXT.

55
00:07:02,677 --> 00:07:08,756
SO I WAS LIKE, "BUT THANK YOU
FOR ALL OF THE NIGHTS THAT BECAME DAYS

56
00:07:08,756 --> 00:07:12,263
AND YOUR INSPIRED
PROFESSIONALISM."

57
00:07:12,397 --> 00:07:14,091
I SEND THE TEXT, ALL RIGHT?

58
00:07:14,091 --> 00:07:17,307
BEFORE I CAN DELETE AND BLOCK
HIM, HE TEXTS ME BACK.

59
00:07:17,307 --> 00:07:21,315
HE GOES, "HEY, I'M SO PROUD OF
YOU.

60
00:07:21,315 --> 00:07:24,722
I'M SO HAPPY YOU GOT SOBER."

61
00:07:24,722 --> 00:07:29,154
YOU KNOW, I
ONLY BOUGHT DRUGS TO SELL TO YOU

62
00:07:29,154 --> 00:07:31,805
BECAUSE I WAS WORRIED ABOUT YOU

63
00:07:31,805 --> 00:07:35,882
AND I DIDN'T WANT YOU TO GET
WORSE STUFF OFF THE STREET."

64
00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:41,927
I KNOW!
AND I'M BREAKING UP WITH THIS
GUY?

65
00:07:42,578 --> 00:07:46,976
SO I CAN'T BLOCK HIM NOW.
I TEXT HIM BACK, YOU KNOW?

66
00:07:48,149 --> 00:07:52,105
AND I GO, "OH, MY GOD.
YOU SWEET MAN."

67
00:07:52,105 --> 00:07:55,784
I SAID, "YOU ONLY BOUGHT
DRUGS TO SELL TO ME?"

68
00:07:55,784 --> 00:07:57,569
HE SAYS "YEAH."

69
00:07:57,569 --> 00:08:01,699
I SAID, "DID YOU SELL DRUGS TO
OTHER PEOPLE?"

70
00:08:01,699 --> 00:08:03,858
HE SAID "NO."

71
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:07,349
I SAID, "THIS IS A WEIRD TIME TO
ASK.

72
00:08:07,349 --> 00:08:09,985
BUT ARE YOU A DRUG DEALER?"

73
00:08:10,437 --> 00:08:15,371
HE SAID, "NO.
I'M A PAINTER.
WE TALKED ABOUT THIS."

74
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:22,625
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I HAVE NO IDEA

75
00:08:22,625 --> 00:08:24,969
HOW I KNOW THIS PERSON.

76
00:08:25,712 --> 00:08:27,886
SO I TEXT HIM.

77
00:08:27,886 --> 00:08:33,154
I GO, "HOW DID IT COME TO BE

78
00:08:33,444 --> 00:08:36,456
THAT YOU SELL ME DRUGS?"

79
00:08:36,456 --> 00:08:42,375
AND HE WROTE BACK, "I DON'T
KNOW.
YOU JUST KEPT ASKING."

80
00:08:42,556 --> 00:08:44,709
I LIKE THAT STORY

81
00:08:44,709 --> 00:08:47,682
BECAUSE THERE ARE MANY TALES OF DRUG DEALERS

82
00:08:47,682 --> 00:08:51,154
WHO HAVE TURNED INNOCENT PEOPLE
INTO DRUG ADDICTS.

83
00:08:51,255 --> 00:08:53,993
I MIGHT BE THE FIRST DRUG ADDICT

84
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:58,450
TO TURN AN INNOCENT MAN INTO A
DRUG DEALER.

85
00:08:58,451 --> 00:09:01,851
PROMISE

86
00:09:04,914 --> 00:09:07,801
LIFE IS A LOT BETTER AND HAPPIER
NOW.

87
00:09:07,801 --> 00:09:09,469
I HAVE A 12-WEEK-OLD SON.

88
00:09:09,469 --> 00:09:11,760
I'M VERY EXCITED.
YES.

89
00:09:13,099 --> 00:09:16,192
HE'S A PRETTY COOL GUY FOR
SOMEONE WHO CAN'T VOTE.

90
00:09:16,192 --> 00:09:19,918
HE HAS -- HIS LEGS ARE LIKE
LITTLE CALZONES, AND I WANT TO
EAT THEM.

91
00:09:19,919 --> 00:09:21,716
MALCOLM

92
00:09:21,716 --> 00:09:26,000
LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT
THE MOMENT I FIRST BONDED THE
HARDEST WITH MALCOLM.

93
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,339
WE'RE IN THE DELIVERY ROOM.
MY GIRLFRIEND GIVES BIRTH TO
HIM.

94
00:09:29,339 --> 00:09:30,708
AND HE'S CRYING A LITTLE.

95
00:09:30,708 --> 00:09:33,977
AND THEY BRING HIM OVER TO THIS
WARMER.

96
00:09:33,977 --> 00:09:37,110
AND THEY PUT HIM UNDER THIS WARMER,
UNDER THIS BIG BRIGHT LIGHT

97
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:39,948
AND LIGHT
THAT'S SHINING IN
HIS FACE.
REALLY BRIGHT

98
00:09:39,949 --> 00:09:41,760
AND -- AND MALCOLM,

99
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:45,024
HE JUST LOOKS AND HE GOES --

100
00:09:49,544 --> 00:09:54,474
HE WAS
ANNOYED, BUT HE DIDN'T SAY
ANYTHING.

101
00:09:54,474 --> 00:09:57,456
AND I WAS LIKE, "THAT'S MY SON."

102
00:09:57,613 --> 00:10:01,235
A POLITE MAN IN AN UNCOMFORTABLE
SITUATION,

103
00:10:01,235 --> 00:10:03,001
BUT HE'S NOT
GOING TO MAKE A FUSS.

104
00:10:03,001 --> 00:10:05,069
AND IT WAS A SUPER BRIGHT LIGHT.

105
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:06,851
ME

106
00:10:06,851 --> 00:10:08,907
HE'D NEVER SEEN ANY LIGHT IN HIS
LIFE.

107
00:10:08,907 --> 00:10:13,645
IT'S FUNNY -- IT'S FUNNY TO SEE
ON A BABY'S FACE THE
EXPRESSION -- JESUS WITH THE
LIGHTS.

108
00:10:13,645 --> 00:10:15,288
MALCOLM IS A VERY GOOD BABY,

109
00:10:15,288 --> 00:10:18,626
HIS FAVORITE PASSIFIER JUST GOT
RECALLED, THOUGH.

110
00:10:18,626 --> 00:10:21,191
IT'S SUCH A BUMMER.
HE LOVED IT.

111
00:10:21,191 --> 00:10:25,243
SO WE HAVE A DOZEN OF THEM.
WE STILL HAVE THEM ON A BASKET
ON THE COUNTER.

112
00:10:25,243 --> 00:10:27,730
AND I CAN SEE THIS LOOK IN HIS
EYES, ALWAYS LIKE,

113
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:31,450
"OH, I WANT
TO USE THOSE, BUT I CAN'T
BECAUSE THEY COULD KILL ME."

114
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:34,237
I'M LIKE, "WELCOME TO MY WORLD,
HOMIE."

115
00:10:37,023 --> 00:10:40,374
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WE HAVE A
GREAT SHOW.

116
00:10:40,374 --> 00:10:43,073
LCD

117
00:10:43,073 --> 00:10:46,851
STICK

118
00:10:54,926 --> 00:10:57,535
>>> THANKS AGAIN FOR TAKING MY
CASE.

119
00:10:57,535 --> 00:10:58,919
>> HOW COULD I NOT?

120
00:10:58,919 --> 00:11:04,449
YOUR NEIGHBOR KEEPS A WILD
MONKEY IN A RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD

121
00:11:04,449 --> 00:11:08,240
AND YOU GO OVER TO
SAY "HI" AND GET MAULED.
IT'S NOT RIGHT.

122
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,925
>> DO YOU THINK WE'LL GET A
SETTLEMENT?
>> ABSOLUTELY.

123
00:11:10,925 --> 00:11:13,007
UNLESS WE WIND UP
WITH THE WRONG JUDGE.

124
00:11:13,007 --> 00:11:17,627
>> OH, YAY.
OH, YAY.
ALL RISE!
THE HONORABLE JUDGE ZENGO
PRESIDING.

125
00:11:22,010 --> 00:11:26,451
>> YEP.
THAT'S A
TOUGH BREAK.
WE GOT THE MONKEY JUDGE.

126
00:11:26,451 --> 00:11:28,184
>> A MONKEY JUDGE?

127
00:11:28,184 --> 00:11:31,984
>> YEAH.
HE WAS APPOINTED LAST YEAR BY
THAT GOVERNOR WHO LOVES PRANKS

128
00:11:31,984 --> 00:11:34,244
AND STRUGGLED WITH ADDICTION.

129
00:11:34,244 --> 00:11:37,115
>> PLEASE BE SEATED.

130
00:11:37,115 --> 00:11:39,776
NO ONE LOOK ME IN THE EYE.

131
00:11:39,776 --> 00:11:42,788
DO NOT MAKE ANY NOISES THAT I
DON'T KNOW.

132
00:11:42,788 --> 00:11:46,367
I DON'T FEEL CORNERED, SO WE CAN
BEGIN.

133
00:11:46,367 --> 00:11:49,503
I HAVE DECIDED TO ALLOW CAMERAS
IN THIS COURTROOM.

134
00:11:49,503 --> 00:11:52,461
HOWEVER, IF I SEE MY IMAGE IN THE MONITOR,

135
00:11:52,461 --> 00:11:57,056
I WILL THINK
IT IS A RIVAL MONKEY AND I WILL
COMPLETELY LOSE IT.

136
00:11:57,056 --> 00:12:01,794
NOW, ALSO, LET THE RECORD SHOW
THAT I AM ALREADY VERY CLOSE TO
COMPLETELY LOSIN

137
00:12:01,794 --> 00:12:06,111
IN THE BLUE WITH THE GRAY.

138
00:12:06,111 --> 00:12:07,874
PROCEED.

139
00:12:07,874 --> 00:12:09,768
>> THANK YOU, YOUR HONOR.

140
00:12:09,768 --> 00:12:14,411
MY CLIENT WENT OVER TO SAY
"HELLO" TO THE DEFENDANT AND HIS
PET MONKEY, GUMMO.

141
00:12:14,411 --> 00:12:16,561
>> NO GUMMO.

142
00:12:16,561 --> 00:12:19,579
>> WHAT?
>> TENGO.

143
00:12:19,867 --> 00:12:23,154
>> YEAH.
I KNOW.
I'M TALKING ABOUT A DIFFERENT
MONKEY.

144
00:12:23,154 --> 00:12:25,791
>> YEAH, YEAH.
NO GUMMO.
TENGO.

145
00:12:25,791 --> 00:12:27,482
>> SHOULD I KEEP GOING?

146
00:12:27,482 --> 00:12:31,648
>> YEAH.
BUT I'M GOT TO THROW A LITTLE
SAND TO SHOW DOMINANCE.

147
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:34,186
>> ALL RIGHT.
OKAY.

148
00:12:34,186 --> 00:12:37,645
SO MY CLIENT WAS AT THE
DEFENDANT'S HOUSE

149
00:12:37,645 --> 00:12:40,353
WHEN OUT OF
NOWHERE, HIS PET MONKEY GRABBED
HER HAT AND --

150
00:12:40,353 --> 00:12:42,129
>> WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA,
WHOA.

151
00:12:42,129 --> 00:12:47,044
WAS IT THE SAME HAT YOU NORMALLY
WEAR, OR WAS IT ANY DIFFERENT?

152
00:12:47,044 --> 00:12:49,690
>> WELL, NORMALLY, I WEAR AN
ORANGE BUCKET HAT,

153
00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:52,052
AND THIS
TIME, I HAD ON A GREEN BASEBALL
CAP.

154
00:12:52,052 --> 00:12:53,367
>> LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT,

155
00:12:53,367 --> 00:12:56,603
YOU WALKED UP TO THIS MONKEY AS A
DIFFERENT SHAPE

156
00:12:56,603 --> 00:12:59,619
AND YOU
EXPECTED, WHAT, HIM TO JUST BE
COOL WITH THAT?

157
00:12:59,619 --> 00:13:03,100
FOR YOU TO NOT FEEL HIS INSANE
BREATH ON YOUR FACE

158
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:06,945
WHILE HE
BROKE ALL THE BONES IN YOUR BODY
WITH THE STRENGTH OF 30 MEN.

159
00:13:06,945 --> 00:13:10,083
>> WELL, HE'S IN A HANGING MOOD
TODAY.

160
00:13:10,083 --> 00:13:12,448
>> ARE YOU SURE?
HE'S SMILING.

161
00:13:12,448 --> 00:13:15,664
>> NO, HE'S BARING HIS TEETH.

162
00:13:17,887 --> 00:13:21,619
>> IT'S HOPELESS.
SO WHO CAN REASON WITH A JUDGE
LIKE THIS?

163
00:13:21,619 --> 00:13:26,677
>> MAY THE DEFENSE APPROACH THE
BENCH IN A SLOW, DELIBERATE WAY

164
00:13:26,677 --> 00:13:29,126
HOLDING A BIRTHDAY CAKE?

165
00:13:29,126 --> 00:13:34,226
>> THE COURT RECOGNIZES THE
SHAPE HE NORMALLY ASSOCIATES
WITH TREATS.

166
00:13:34,226 --> 00:13:39,124
>> AS I APPROACH, YOUR HONOR,
I'D LIKE TO NOTIFY THE COURT

167
00:13:39,124 --> 00:13:42,334
THAT I AM WEARING PERFUME, BUT I
AM NOT FRUIT.

168
00:13:42,334 --> 00:13:45,238
>> THE COURT APPRECIATES THE
CLARIFICATION.

169
00:13:45,238 --> 00:13:50,826
I WILL TAKE THIS CAKE, AND I
WILL PLACE IT IN MY PILE OF
SHREDDED NEWSPAPER.

170
00:13:50,826 --> 00:13:53,974
AND I WILL ALSO TAKE THIS SHINY
THING.

171
00:13:53,974 --> 00:13:59,512
LET THE RECORD SHOW THAT THIS
SHINY
THING WAS HIS AND NOW IT'S MINE.

172
00:13:59,512 --> 00:14:03,487
AND IT GOES IN THE NEWSPAPER WITH THE CAKE,

173
00:14:03,487 --> 00:14:09,197
SO NOW I HAVE WON
MANY THINGS AND I KNOW VISUALLY
WHAT I HAVE.

174
00:14:09,197 --> 00:14:11,321
>> YOU ARE THE ALPHA.
>> YES.

175
00:14:11,321 --> 00:14:15,803
>> OBJECTION!
YOUR HONOR, IT IS OBVIOUS THAT
YOU'RE FAVORING THE DEFENSE.

176
00:14:15,803 --> 00:14:17,613
>> THAT IS RIDICULOUS.

177
00:14:17,613 --> 00:14:21,227
>> YOUR HONOR?
I LOVE JUDGE.

178
00:14:21,227 --> 00:14:23,136
>> I LOVE YOU.

179
00:14:23,136 --> 00:14:25,758
>> I LOVE JUDGE.

180
00:14:25,758 --> 00:14:29,095
>> YOU ARE BABY.
JUDGE LOVE BABY.

181
00:14:29,095 --> 00:14:31,485
BRING JUDGE BABY.
JUDGE LOVE YOU.

182
00:14:31,485 --> 00:14:32,779
JUDGE FAVOR DEFENSE.

183
00:14:32,779 --> 00:14:37,114
>> COME ON!
>> YEAH.
WE MOVE TO REQUEST A NEW JUDGE.

184
00:14:37,114 --> 00:14:40,008
>> ARE YOU SUGGESTING THAT I'M
NOT COMPETENT?

185
00:14:40,008 --> 00:14:43,438
TENGO MADE THESE PIECES MATCH.

186
00:14:43,438 --> 00:14:46,946
SURE IT WAS A BIT OF TRIAL AND
ERROR, BUT I DID IT.

187
00:14:46,946 --> 00:14:49,692
I WON THE JUTE.

188
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:54,836
I'M GETTING TIRED AND I FEEL
SLIGHTLY CORNERED

189
00:14:54,836 --> 00:14:57,401
AND THIS IS
ALL GETTING SO, SO DANGEROUS.

190
00:14:57,401 --> 00:14:59,461
SO I'M
JUST GOING TO DISMISS THE
ENTIRE --

191
00:14:59,461 --> 00:15:02,012
>> WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
I WOULD LIKE TO CALL A SURPRISE
WITNESS.

192
00:15:02,012 --> 00:15:06,447
>> UNLESS THAT SURPRISE WITNESS
IS A RATTY OLD STUFFED ANIMAL
FOR ME TO VIOLATE,

193
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:10,733
I ASSURE YOU
THE COURT IS NOT INTERESTED IN
BEING STARTLED.

194
00:15:10,733 --> 00:15:14,395
>> WELL, I GOT SOME GOOD NEWS
FOR YOU, JUDGE.

195
00:15:14,395 --> 00:15:17,814
>> THAT SIDE WINS.
THAT SIDE WINS.

196
00:15:18,926 --> 00:15:21,019
>>> NEXT ON "MONKEY JUDGE,"

197
00:15:21,019 --> 00:15:25,119
A PUBLIC URINATOR MARKED THE
WRONG TERRITORY GETS THE MAXIMUM
PENALTY.

198
00:15:25,119 --> 00:15:27,181
HIS PENIS RIPPED CLEAN OFF OF HIS
BODY.

199
00:15:27,181 --> 00:15:29,000
MONKEY JUDGE.

200
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:35,699
SORRY

201
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:39,102
>> REBECCA, HI.

202
00:15:39,102 --> 00:15:41,713
LOOKS LIKE WE'RE BOTH BUYING DOG
FOOD TODAY.

203
00:15:41,713 --> 00:15:44,013
>> WELL, NOT REALLY.

204
00:15:44,013 --> 00:15:47,159
I'M BUYING BLUE RIVER DOG FOOD,
WHICH IS REAL FOOD

205
00:15:47,159 --> 00:15:50,217
WHICH MY
GUNTHER REALLY APPRECIATES.
RIGHT, BUDDY?

206
00:15:50,217 --> 00:15:54,299
AND HAVE YOU EVER LOOKED AT THE
INGREDIENTS ON THAT BIG NAME
BRAND DOG FOOD YOU'RE BUYING?

207
00:15:54,299 --> 00:15:55,830
>> IT SEEMED FINE TO ME.
>> REALLY?

208
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:59,576
OKAY.
WELL, THEN, WHY DON'T YOU READ
THEM OUT LOUD IN FRONT OF YOUR
DOG.

209
00:15:59,576 --> 00:16:02,374
>> OKAY.
CORN, CHICKEN.

210
00:16:02,374 --> 00:16:04,740
>> GO ON.
CONTINUE.
>> CORN GLUTEN MEAL.

211
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:08,432
>> SORRY, WHAT IS THAT "CORN
GLUTEN MEAL?"
>> NO, I THINK YOU HEARD ME.

212
00:16:08,432 --> 00:16:11,344
>> HOW MUCH DO YOU PAY FOR BLUE
RIVER?
LIKE $80.

213
00:16:11,344 --> 00:16:14,488
>> IT'S NOT $80, IT'S $73.99.

214
00:16:14,488 --> 00:16:18,352
IT'S ACTUALLY ONLY 32 CENTS MORE
A DAY THAN YOU WHAT YOU PAY
MONTHLY.
>> NO, IT'S NOT.

215
00:16:18,352 --> 00:16:23,026
>> ACTUALLY, IT IS.
IF YOU TAKE THE DIFFERENCE IN
THE PRICES BETWEEN THE TWO BAGS
AND DIVIDE THAT BY 28.

216
00:16:23,026 --> 00:16:26,211
28 DAYS IN A MONTH, RIGHT?
7 DAYS IN A WEEK, CORRECT?
CORRECT?

217
00:16:26,211 --> 00:16:27,914
>> CORRECT.
>> CORRECT.
YOU AGREE.
>> I SHOULD BE GOING.

218
00:16:27,914 --> 00:16:30,535
>> YEAH, OKAY.
28.
28 DAYS.
4 WEEKS IS A MONTH, RIGHT?

219
00:16:30,535 --> 00:16:33,291
SO DIVIDE IT BY 28, WHICH WE
BOTH AGREED IS A MONTH.
>> YES.

220
00:16:33,291 --> 00:16:36,333
>> IT COMES OUT TO 32 CENTS A
DAY MONTHLY.

221
00:16:36,333 --> 00:16:41,401
>> I GUESS I WOULDN'T BE
BRAGGING ABOUT ALL THIS SAVINGS
BECAUSE IT IS NOT AS MUCH AS YOU
THINK.

222
00:16:41,401 --> 00:16:43,445
>> NO, THAT MATH DOESN'T MAKE
SENSE.

223
00:16:43,445 --> 00:16:45,812
>> OH, YOU DON'T THINK SO?
WELL, WHY DON'T WE ASK MY
HUSBAND.
DANIEL.

224
00:16:45,812 --> 00:16:47,035
>> OH, MY GOD, I DON'T CARE.

225
00:16:47,035 --> 00:16:51,613
>> OH, MY GOD.
YOU'RE NOT PLANNING ON FEEDING
THAT TO YOUR FUR BABY, ARE YOU?

226
00:16:51,613 --> 00:16:53,880
>> SHE LIKES IT, OKAY?
AND I'M SAVING MONEY.

227
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,227
>> 32 CENTS A DAY MONTHLY?

228
00:16:55,227 --> 00:16:59,096
THAT'S WORTH IT TO YOU?
FOR YOU DOG NOT TO BE ABLE TO
WALK?

229
00:17:00,012 --> 00:17:02,869
>> OH, MY GOD.
THAT'S --

230
00:17:02,869 --> 00:17:06,067
THAT'S WHY THE DOG HAS BEEN IN
THIS STUPID CART.

231
00:17:06,067 --> 00:17:10,080
IT CAN'T WALK.
BECAUSE OF THE FOOD.

232
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:12,456
THE DOG HAS JUST BEEN SITTING
THERE IN THE CART

233
00:17:12,456 --> 00:17:16,269
AND LIKE I
THINK SUBCONSCIOUSLY I KNEW WHAT
THAT MEANT THE WHOLE TIME.

234
00:17:16,269 --> 00:17:20,336
BUT I WASN'T EVEN READY TO SHOW
THAT TO MYSELF, TO SHOW ME THAT.

235
00:17:20,336 --> 00:17:21,863
>> OKAY.
LOOK, SHE CAN WALK.

236
00:17:21,863 --> 00:17:25,227
>> PEOPLE LIKE YOU SHOULD BE
HUNG IN A PUBLIC SQUARE.

237
00:17:25,227 --> 00:17:27,798
>> LOOK AT ME.
I CAN FIX THIS.

238
00:17:27,798 --> 00:17:30,624
>> I JUST FEEL LIKE THESE
ANIMALS HAVE NO VOICE.

239
00:17:30,624 --> 00:17:32,507
WHO WILL BE THEIR VOICE?

240
00:17:32,507 --> 00:17:37,390
>> YOU WILL.

241
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:37,144
REBECCA ANN BUSH, LOOK AT ME.

242
00:17:37,568 --> 00:17:40,051
LOOK AT GUNTHER.

243
00:17:41,121 --> 00:17:43,636
LOOK AT PRIME TIME.

244
00:17:43,921 --> 00:17:46,204
LOOK AT WANTON.

245
00:17:46,914 --> 00:17:49,595
LOOK AT ALEXANDER.

246
00:17:49,595 --> 00:17:54,982
YOU ALWAYS, ALWAYS HAVE BEEN
THEIR ADVOCATES AND THEIR VOICE,

247
00:17:54,982 --> 00:17:58,811
MORE THAN ANYONE, ANYONE WHO
EVER LIVED.

248
00:17:58,811 --> 00:18:01,601
>> I KNOW.
I KNOW.
BUT I FEEL LIKE IT'S TOO LATE.

249
00:18:01,601 --> 00:18:04,680
I MEAN, THE DOG CAN'T WALK.
IT IS JUST SITTING THERE
HUMILIATED.

250
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:09,451
>> IT WILL WALK IF IT STARTS
EATING BLUE RIVER TODAY.

251
00:18:09,451 --> 00:18:13,167
NOW, FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, LOOK
YOUR DOG IN THE EYE

252
00:18:13,167 --> 00:18:15,571
AND LISTEN
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN YOUR LIFE.

253
00:18:15,571 --> 00:18:20,219
>> FINE.
FELICITY, WHAT DO YOU WANT?

254
00:18:20,809 --> 00:18:24,272
>> I WANT BLUE RIVER DOG FOOD,
MOMMA.

255
00:18:24,272 --> 00:18:27,584
I WANT TO WALK.

256
00:18:27,584 --> 00:18:30,529
IT'S ONLY 32 CENTS MORE A DAY.

257
00:18:30,529 --> 00:18:33,406
I DON'T WANT A CORN
GLUTEN MEAL.

258
00:18:33,406 --> 00:18:35,459
LISTEN

259
00:18:36,215 --> 00:18:40,082
>> DO IT!
DO THE RIGHT THING!
IT'S NOT TOO LATE.

260
00:18:40,082 --> 00:18:44,022
>> OH, MY GOD.
FINE.
I WILL BUY THE BLUE RIVER, OKAY?

261
00:18:45,713 --> 00:18:48,779
MAY I GO NOW, PLEASE?
>> DEFINITELY.

262
00:18:48,779 --> 00:18:52,214
>> WE JUST SAVED THAT DOG'S
LIFE.

263
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:54,315
>> NOT WE.
YOU.

264
00:18:54,315 --> 00:18:56,991
AND YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE?
I THINK I'M READY TO DO IT.

265
00:18:56,991 --> 00:18:59,609
I THINK I'M FINALLY READY TO
MAKE LOVE TO YOU.

266
00:18:59,609 --> 00:19:03,528
>> WHAT?
IT'S WORKING?
>> IF THIS IS WHAT I THINK IT
IS, IT'S WORKING.

267
00:19:03,528 --> 00:19:06,822
>> EVERYONE, HE SAYS IT'S
WORKING!

268
00:19:07,049 --> 00:19:08,659
>> CONGRATULATIONS!

269
00:19:08,659 --> 00:19:12,336
>> I CAN REALLY THANK YOU, YEAH.

270
00:19:12,336 --> 00:19:17,049
>> BLUE RIVER DOG FOOD.
IF YOU WANT YOUR DOG TO EVER
WALK AGAIN.

271
00:19:20,707 --> 00:19:22,805
>> I'M SO GLAD WE'RE DOING THIS.

272
00:19:22,805 --> 00:19:25,140
MY FAVORITE RESTAURANT WITH MY
FAVORITE PEOPLE.

273
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:28,186
>> 100%.

274
00:19:28,186 --> 00:19:31,935
>> YOU KNOW WHAT?
THIS IS SO FUN.
DINNER IS ON US.

275
00:19:31,935 --> 00:19:36,581
>> WOW.
BUT YOU KNOW YOU CAN TAKE YOUR
MASK OFF AT THE TABLE.

276
00:19:36,581 --> 00:19:39,824
>> I'M SORRY.
I DON'T KNOW I'M WEARING IT HALF
THE TIME.

277
00:19:39,824 --> 00:19:43,247
>> WELL, I HEARD THE CDC IS
GOING TO LIFT ALL MASK MANDATES
SO --

278
00:19:43,248 --> 00:19:45,171
KNOW

279
00:19:45,171 --> 00:19:49,848
>> THAT'S SO WEIRD.
IT'S LIKE COVID'S NOT OVER, BUT
WE'RE ALL JUST GONNA STOP?

280
00:19:49,848 --> 00:19:51,651
I DON'T KNOW HOW I FEEL ABOUT
THAT.
>> YEAH.

281
00:19:51,651 --> 00:19:53,938
>> OH, YOU KNOW WHAT?
THAT REMINDS ME OF AN ARTICLE I
READ.

282
00:19:53,938 --> 00:19:56,027
>> OH, HONEY, NO ONE WANTS TO
HEAR ABOUT THAT.

283
00:19:56,027 --> 00:19:59,550
>> WELL, IT WAS IN BLOOMBERG AND
I THOUGHT IT WAS INTERESTING.

284
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:02,036
>> WHAT, UH -- WHAT ARTICLE?

285
00:20:02,036 --> 00:20:04,477
>> WELL --
>> HONEY.

286
00:20:04,477 --> 00:20:08,054
IT WAS JUST SAYING HOW MASK
MANDATES HAD,

287
00:20:08,054 --> 00:20:12,551
I DON'T KNOW,
LITTLE TO NO EFFECT ON COVID.

288
00:20:29,689 --> 00:20:34,202
ANYTHING.

289
00:20:34,202 --> 00:20:37,551
I JUST WONDER IF SOMETIMES ANY
OF THE THINGS WE DID ACTUALLY
HELPED.

290
00:20:37,551 --> 00:20:39,290
>> GINA!
>> NO, NO, NO.

291
00:20:39,290 --> 00:20:44,048
WE CAN TALK ABOUT THIS
INCREDIBLY COMPLICATED AND
EMOTIONAL TOPIC.

292
00:20:44,048 --> 00:20:46,671
>> I WILL START

293
00:20:46,671 --> 00:20:50,864
BECAUSE, FOR
INSTANCE, WHILE I'M

294
00:20:50,864 --> 00:20:53,315
SO PERSONALLY
RELIEVED THAT I'M VACCINATED --

295
00:20:53,315 --> 00:20:55,399
>> CAREFUL.

296
00:20:55,399 --> 00:20:58,741
>> -- I JUST, YOU KNOW, I
SOMETIMES WONDER

297
00:20:58,741 --> 00:21:01,615
IF OTHER PEOPLE
WHO ARE HESITANT --

298
00:21:01,615 --> 00:21:03,989
>> CAREFUL.

299
00:21:03,989 --> 00:21:07,148
>> -- MIGHT NOT HAVE, LIKE, A
VALID --

300
00:21:07,148 --> 00:21:09,336
>> WHAT.

301
00:21:09,336 --> 00:21:12,786
>> NOT -- NOT VALID, BUT -- BUT
AN UNDERSTANDABLE --

302
00:21:12,786 --> 00:21:15,761
>> NOT TONIGHT.

303
00:21:15,761 --> 00:21:16,742
>> HELP ME.

304
00:21:16,742 --> 00:21:20,300
>> I THINK WHAT SHE MEANS IS
THAT SOMETIMES,

305
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:24,154
WE CAN ALL BE A
LITTLE OVERZEALOUS WHEN WE
CONDEMN --

306
00:21:24,154 --> 00:21:26,776
>> OH, NO.

307
00:21:26,776 --> 00:21:31,304
>> I JUST THINK, IF PEOPLE ARE
ACTUALLY LOSING THEIR JOBS --

308
00:21:31,304 --> 00:21:34,042
>> OH, NO.

309
00:21:34,042 --> 00:21:35,901
>> CAREFUL, GIRL.

310
00:21:35,901 --> 00:21:39,736
>> LOOK.
VACCINES SAVE LIVES, FACT.
OKAY?

311
00:21:39,736 --> 00:21:42,466
THEY STOP THE HOSPITALS FROM
BEING OVERRUN, FACT.

312
00:21:42,466 --> 00:21:45,654
>> WHERE ARE YOU UP TO?

313
00:21:45,654 --> 00:21:49,786
>> BUT DID I HAVE TO DUMP MY
OLDEST FRIEND JUST BECAUSE HE
DIDN'T GET --

314
00:21:49,786 --> 00:21:51,031
>> OH, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO,
NO, NO, NO.

315
00:21:51,031 --> 00:21:53,862
>> -- A BOOSTER?

316
00:22:18,739 --> 00:22:21,231
>> GUYS, GUYS, COME ON.
THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE FUN.

317
00:22:21,231 --> 00:22:23,234
ISN'T THERE SOMETHING HAPPY WE
CAN TALK ABOUT?

318
00:22:23,234 --> 00:22:25,312
>> NO!
NO.
WE STARTED THIS, AND
WE NEED TO FINISH IT.

319
00:22:25,312 --> 00:22:27,200
DAVID, GO.
MAKE SENSE OF THIS.

320
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:31,988
>> OH, OKAY.
WELL, I -- I THINK THE BIGGEST
MISTAKE THE ADMINISTRATION MADE

321
00:22:31,988 --> 00:22:33,963
WAS NOT PROVIDING MORE TESTING.

322
00:22:33,963 --> 00:22:38,537
>> BUT THE U.K. HAD TONS OF
TESTING AND EVEN MORE COVID.

323
00:22:38,537 --> 00:22:40,248
>> DUH.

324
00:22:40,248 --> 00:22:43,908
>> AT LEAST BIDEN'S FINALLY SENT
OUT ALL THE TESTS OVER
CHRISTMAS.

325
00:22:43,908 --> 00:22:48,070
>> YOU MEAN THE TWO TESTS FOR A
FAMILY OF EIGHT THAT FROZE IN
THE MAIL?

326
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:50,243
GGG

327
00:22:50,243 --> 00:22:52,959
>> WELL, AT LEAST WE HAVE THE
CDC.

328
00:22:52,959 --> 00:22:56,362
I MEAN, THEY HAVEN'T ALWAYS BEEN
PERFECT, BUT THE SCIENCE
CHANGED.

329
00:22:56,362 --> 00:22:58,586
>> HM, HOW DOES SCIENCE CHANGE?

330
00:22:58,586 --> 00:23:02,409
WHEN I MAKE A MISTAKE AT WORK, I
DON'T GET TO SAY, "THE SCIENCE
CHANGED."

331
00:23:02,409 --> 00:23:04,096
LLL

332
00:23:04,096 --> 00:23:06,716
>> AT LEAST WE HAD OUTDOOR
DINING?

333
00:23:06,716 --> 00:23:11,712
>> OH.
YOU MEAN WHEN THEY BUILT
A SMALLER RESTAURANT IN THE
STREET?
HOW IS THAT OUTDOORS?

334
00:23:11,712 --> 00:23:13,213
>> OH, MY GOD.

335
00:23:13,213 --> 00:23:16,614
>> OKAY.
I -- I WENT TO A CHILD'S
BIRTHDAY PARTY, SELF  CAREFUL --

336
00:23:16,614 --> 00:23:20,520
AND, UM, THEY DID GYMNASTICS IN
MASKS -- DON'T --

337
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:26,010
AND THEN THEY
WENT INTO ANOTHER ROOM AND THEY
TOOK OFF THEIR MASKS TO EAT PIZZA --

338
00:23:26,010 --> 00:23:27,371
THIS IS THE END OF ME.

339
00:23:27,371 --> 00:23:30,774
SO DID THEY REALLY NEED THE
MASK?

340
00:23:30,774 --> 00:23:32,275
OH, NO.

341
00:23:32,275 --> 00:23:37,292
>> DID ANY OF US EVER REALLY
NEED THE MASK?

342
00:23:37,292 --> 00:23:41,798
>> NO!

343
00:23:49,859 --> 00:23:52,060
>> I LIKE TURTLES.

344
00:23:53,696 --> 00:23:57,324
>> MY GOD.
MY GOD.
I'M SO GLAD I
SAID THAT OUT LOUD.

345
00:23:57,324 --> 00:23:59,293
>> YES, OF COURSE -- OF COURSE
WE NEEDED THE MASKS.
WE NEEDED.

346
00:23:59,293 --> 00:24:02,984
WE MAY NOT KNOW FOR YEARS THE
FULL EXTENT OF WHAT WE'VE BEEN THROUGH,

347
00:24:02,984 --> 00:24:05,783
BUT WE DID OUR BEST,
AND WE'RE GOING TO GET THROUGH
THIS.

348
00:24:05,783 --> 00:24:07,933
>> AMEN.

349
00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:11,779
>> WHEN AN ANTI-VAXXER GETS IT,
I FEEL HAPPY.

350
00:24:11,779 --> 00:24:14,291
>> NO, YOU DON'T.
NO, YOU DON'T.

351
00:24:14,291 --> 00:24:16,906
>> WAIT.
WE DON'T HAVE TO WASH OUR HANDS
ANYMORE, DO WE?

352
00:24:16,906 --> 00:24:19,106
>> HA, HA, HA, I NEVER DID.

353
00:24:19,474 --> 00:24:22,038
>> WAIT.
WHERE'S MY WIFE?

354
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:34,070
GOD
VARIANT?

355
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:36,399
>> ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
>> OH, MY GOD, ANOTHER ONE?

356
00:24:36,399 --> 00:24:39,300
>> WHEN IS COVID GONNA BE OVER?
THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

357
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:42,192
>> OH, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
APPARENTLY THIS ONE IS GOOD.

358
00:24:42,192 --> 00:24:43,754
>> WHAT DO YOU MEAN, "IT'S
GOOD"?

359
00:24:43,754 --> 00:24:45,775
>> I DUNNO, LET ME JUST --

360
00:24:45,775 --> 00:24:48,240
THEY'RE CALLING IT A
MIRACLE.

361
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:52,345
A NEW STRAIN OF COVID-19 THAT'S
MUTATED SO HARD,

362
00:24:52,345 --> 00:24:53,979
IT'S ACTUALLY
GOOD.

363
00:24:53,979 --> 00:24:55,333
>> WAIT.
NO.

364
00:24:55,333 --> 00:24:57,768
>> IT'S CALLED THE GELVENIE VARIANT,

365
00:24:57,862 --> 00:25:03,101
AND IT DOESN'T MAKE YOU
SICK, IT JUST MAKES YOU FEEL
DOPE.

366
00:25:03,101 --> 00:25:06,044
DUDE, IT LIKE DOESN'T GIVE YOU A
FEVER OR ANYTHING?

367

LIKE, COOL AND CONFIDENT.

368
00:25:08,311 --> 00:25:10,777

BEACHES OF CABO SAN LUCAS.

369
00:25:10,777 --> 00:25:14,475
>> DUDE, HAVING GELVENIE IS LIKE
HAVING A DRINK WITH AN OLD
FRIEND.

CANDACE AND PAUL,

411
00:27:47,639 --> 00:27:51,475
HOW DO WE THINK THE SHOW IS
GOING SO FAR, AND DON'T BE
AFRAID TO BE BRUTAL.

412
00:27:51,476 --> 00:27:54,064
>> WELL, NOT TO BE A TOTAL BITCH

413
00:27:54,064 --> 00:27:57,658
BUT MY FIVE-TIMER SHOW IN
DECEMBER WAS GOING TO BE A LOT
BETTER.

414
00:27:57,658 --> 00:28:00,788
THAT IS, UNTIL THE WHOLE CAST
DECIDED TO CALL OUT SICK.

415
00:28:00,788 --> 00:28:04,743
>> WELL, THEY GOT COVID.
>> SO, WHAT?
I HAVE COVID RIGHT NOW!

416
00:28:04,743 --> 00:28:07,665
I GOT IT FROM THE QUEEN.

417
00:28:07,665 --> 00:28:10,379
HUMBLE BRAG.

>> THAT'S WHAT I SAID, PHILLIP.

439
00:29:34,608 --> 00:29:39,970
>> WHAT KIND OF A DRINK IS THAT?
>> MM, IT'S THE FIVE-TIMERS'
FIZZ.

440
00:29:39,970 --> 00:29:43,075
IT'S MADE WITH JUSTIN TIMBERLAKE
TEQUILA, DAN AYKROYD VODKA,

441
00:29:43,075 --> 00:29:46,651
AND
TRACY MORGAN'S CLUB SODA, WHICH
IS AQUARIUM WATER.

442
00:29:46,651 --> 00:29:50,440
>> GROSS.
DAN AYKROYD VODKA?

443
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:52,181
LISTEN,

444
00:29:52,181 --> 00:29:56,464
I HAVE TO SAY, I HAD NO IDEA
PEOPLE GOT TREATED THIS WELL.

445
00:29:56,464 --> 00:29:58,696
YOU KNOW, WHEN I WORKED HERE, I
WAS JUST A WRITER.

446
00:29:58,696 --> 00:30:00,837
>> WELL, YOU WERE ONE OF THE
BEST.

447
00:30:00,837 --> 00:30:03,451
I MEAN, YOU WROTE THAT CHARACTER
WITH BILL HADER

448
00:30:03,451 --> 00:30:06,989
AND 800 OTHER
THINGS THAT AGED REALLY
TERRIBLY.

449
00:30:06,989 --> 00:30:08,439
>> THANK YOU.

450
00:30:08,439 --> 00:30:10,176
>> AH, WELL, THAT'S ALL BEHIND
YOU.

451
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:12,450
TONIGHT YOU ARE IN THE COMPANY
OF COMEDY LEGENDS

452
00:30:12,450 --> 00:30:17,131
AND THE
SEXIEST MAN ALIVE.

453
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:22,031
>> OH, THIS SILLY THING?

454
00:30:22,031 --> 00:30:24,528
PAUL, THAT WAS SO 2021.

455
00:30:24,528 --> 00:30:29,185
I WAS TALKING ABOUT
MR. ELLIOT GOULD.

456
00:30:32,316 --> 00:30:34,834
>> OH, HELLO.

457
00:30:34,834 --> 00:30:36,980
>> OH, MY GOD.
ELLIOT.

458
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:39,644
>> WELL, PAUL MAY HAVE "PEOPLE"
MAGAZINE,

459
00:30:39,644 --> 00:30:42,880
BUT I WAS NAMED
"SEXIEST MAN ALIVE"

460
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:47,118
BY CHEST
HAIR MAGAZINE.

461
00:30:49,364 --> 00:30:54,367
>> HEY, ELLIOT, DO YOU REMEMBER
BEING ON MY SITCOM?
>> SHOULD I?

462
00:30:55,189 --> 00:30:59,507
>> SO, JOHN, WE'VE GOT SOME
BUSINESS TO DISCUSS.

463
00:30:59,507 --> 00:31:03,456
THE CLUB HERE HAS GOTTEN SO BIG

464
00:31:03,456 --> 00:31:07,732
THAT IN ORDER FOR YOU TO GET IN,
SOMEONE HAS TO RETIRE.

465
00:31:07,732 --> 00:31:11,235
>> YEAH, TOO BAD NO ONE HERE IS
AT RETIREMENT AGE.

466
00:31:11,885 --> 00:31:16,724
>> YOU ARE 76.
>> BUT I HAVE THE CHILD OF A
38-YEAR-OLD.

467
00:31:16,724 --> 00:31:19,445
AND WE GET RID OF TINA.

468
00:31:19,445 --> 00:31:22,984
SHE WAS THE FIRST WOMAN TO WEAR
GLASSES ON TV.

469
00:31:22,984 --> 00:31:27,109
>> THAT IS TRUE.
"ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY" CALLED IT
DISGUSTING.

470
00:31:27,109 --> 00:31:30,622
AND IT CAN'T BE CANDICE BECAUSE
SHE WAS BACK HERE IN THE '70s.

471
00:31:30,622 --> 00:31:33,605
YOU CAN IMAGINE HOW MUCH SEXUAL
HARASSMENT THAT HAPPENED BACK
THEN?

472
00:31:33,605 --> 00:31:37,258
>> OH, PLEASE.
THOSE GUYS DID REALLY WEIRD
STUFF.

473
00:31:37,258 --> 00:31:40,392
>> I WAS FINE WITH IT.

474
00:31:40,392 --> 00:31:43,311
>> SO YOU'RE SAYING THERE'S NO
ROOM FOR ME?

475
00:31:43,382 --> 00:31:47,146
>> THIS WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A
VERY SMALL CLUB,

476
00:31:47,235 --> 00:31:50,821
WITH JUST THE
HIGHEST QUALITY STARS.
DOES THAT MAKE SENSE?

477
00:31:50,821 --> 00:31:53,756
>> YEAH.
YEAH.
SO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS --

478
00:31:53,756 --> 00:31:59,228
>> I THINK WHAT WE'RE ALL TRYING
TO SAY IS THIS HAS BECOME NOT
SPECIAL.

479
00:31:59,228 --> 00:32:01,738
>> DID SOMEONE SAY --

480
00:32:14,689 --> 00:32:17,993
>> DID SOMEBODY SAY NOT SPECIAL?

481
00:32:17,993 --> 00:32:20,389
>> CONAN, WHAT ARE YOU DOING
HERE?

482
00:32:20,389 --> 00:32:23,243
>> WELL, I'M JUST HERE TO SIGN
UP FOR PEACOCK.

483
00:32:23,243 --> 00:32:26,492
IT'S WEIRD THEY MAKE YOU DO IT
IN PERSON.

484
00:32:26,492 --> 00:32:31,350
>> LOOK, JOHN, DO NOT LISTEN TO
THEM.
THIS IS VERY SPECIAL.

485
00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:38,584
I WAS IN THE VERY FIRST
FIVE-TIMERS SPECIAL -- THING

486
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:41,600
WRITERS

487
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:44,229
>> A LOT OF US WERE WRITERS
HERE.

488
00:32:44,229 --> 00:32:46,562
>> YES.
BUT YOU WERE ON THE SHOW WHEN
YOU WERE A WRITER,

489
00:32:46,562 --> 00:32:48,600
SO SHUT UP!

490
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:51,862
JOHN AND I WERE NEVER SUPPOSED
TO BE ON TV.

491
00:32:51,862 --> 00:32:55,283
'CAUSE WE'RE BOTH HIDEOUS,
RIGHT?
RIGHT, JOHN!
>> I -- I GUESS.

492
00:32:55,386 --> 00:32:58,225
>> YES, WE ARE!
WE'RE HERE AND WE'RE TAKING
WHAT'S OURS.

493
00:32:58,287 --> 00:33:01,390
WE WANT TO TAKE IT BY THE HORNS.

494
00:33:02,379 --> 00:33:05,516
THE POINT IS, YOU START HERE AND
YOU CAN DO GREAT THINGS.

495
00:33:05,516 --> 00:33:07,841
I HOSTED MY OWN TV SHOW FOR
DECADES.

496
00:33:07,937 --> 00:33:12,365
AND WHAT ARE YOU DOING NOW?
>> I HAVE A PODCAST.

497
00:33:12,365 --> 00:33:15,100
>> WELL, I NEVER THOUGHT I'D SAY
THIS, BUT CONAN HAS A POINT.

498
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:18,666
BEING IN THIS CLUB IS PRETTY
DAMN SPECIAL.

499
00:33:18,666 --> 00:33:21,440
>> YES!
YES!
COME ON.
LET'S GIVE HIM HIS JACKET.

500
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:24,501
>> ALL RIGHT, PAUL.
GIVE HIM YOUR JACKET.

501
00:33:24,501 --> 00:33:28,109
>> AH, MAN.
IT WAS FUN WHILE IT LASTED.

502
00:33:31,716 --> 00:33:34,607
GUYS

503
00:33:34,607 --> 00:33:38,401
THIS -- THIS REALLY DOES --
JUST, IT MEANS THE WORLD TO ME.

504
00:33:38,401 --> 00:33:40,744
>> OH YEAH.
AND HEY, ONE MORE THING.

505
00:33:40,744 --> 00:33:42,767
LIVE FROM NEW YORK --

506
00:33:42,833 --> 00:33:45,803
>> OH, NO, CONAN.
WE DID THAT ALREADY.

507
00:33:45,803 --> 00:33:47,517
>> I'LL DOING IT ANYWAY.

508
00:33:47,517 --> 00:33:51,400
LIVE FROM NEW YORK, IT'S
SATURDAY NIGHT!

509
00:34:03,303 --> 00:34:07,289
>>> LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, LCD
SOUNDSYSTEM!

510
00:34:07,289 --> 00:34:13,297
Thrills

511

YOU'VE BEEN LOOSE-KNIT *

525
00:35:44,638 --> 00:35:48,693

BECAUSE YOU WANT ME
BECAUSE YOU WANT ME *

00:36:19,350 --> 00:36:23,307
* BUT ALL OF MY DESIRE

530
00:36:23,307 --> 00:36:28,202
IS GOING TO CRUSH ME
WHEN YOU EXPIRE *

531
00:36:28,202 --> 00:36:32,253
* BUT I'M STILL ALL KILLS

532

533
00:36:36,963 --> 00:36:40,966
But I'm still all kills

534
00:36:40,966 --> 00:36:46,126
When its all pills
I need my thrills

535
00:37:32,256 --> 00:37:37,432
>>> IT'S "WEEKEND UPDATE" WITH
COLIN JOST AND MICHAEL CHE.

536
00:37:43,802 --> 00:37:47,268
>> THANK YOU.
GOOD EVENING, EVERYBODY.

537
00:37:47,268 --> 00:37:50,712
>> WELCOME TO "WEEKEND UPDATE."
I'M MICHAEL CHE.
>> I'M COLIN JOST.

538
00:37:51,293 --> 00:37:54,812
THIS WEEK RUSSIA BEGAN THEIR
INVASION OF UKRAINE.

539
00:37:54,813 --> 00:37:57,810
ALLIES

540
00:37:57,810 --> 00:38:00,901
BELARUS

541
00:38:01,383 --> 00:38:04,645
MANY ANALYSTS WERE SURPRISED
THAT PUTIN WENT THROUGH WITH IT

542
00:38:04,645 --> 00:38:07,396
EVEN THOUGH IT WAS OBVIOUSLY
GOING TO BE A COLOSSAL MISTAKE.

543
00:38:07,396 --> 00:38:09,800
BUT HE COULDN'T BACK DOWN AFTER
ALL THAT BUILD UP.

544
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:15,699
KIND OF LIKE HOW NBC STILL HAD
TO GO THROUGH WITH AIRING THE
WINTER OLYMPICS.

545
00:38:19,096 --> 00:38:24,444
EXPERTS ON RUSSIAN POLITICS ARE
SAYING THAT ECONOMIC SANCTIONS
FROM THE WEST WILL NOT DETER PUTIN

546
00:38:24,444 --> 00:38:28,376
BECAUSE HIS MONEY IS IN
NON-TRADITIONAL ASSETS THAT ARE
DIFFICULT TO TRACE.

547
00:38:28,376 --> 00:38:32,005
SO ON TOP OF EVERYTHING ELSE
AWFUL ABOUT PUTIN,

548
00:38:32,005 --> 00:38:34,493
HE'S ALSO
INTO CRYPTO.

549
00:38:35,486 --> 00:38:42,481
UKRAINE, THE RUSSIA STOCK MARKET
FELL BY 30% TO NEGATIVE 90%.

550
00:38:42,481 --> 00:38:45,480
THAT'S A TOUGH SUBJECT TO MAKE
JOKES ABOUT.

551
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:49,275
I MEAN, WE HAVE SEEN FOOTAGE OF
ATTACKS LIKE THIS ON OTHER
COUNTRIES,

552
00:38:49,275 --> 00:38:51,696
BUT NEVER THE WHITE
ONES.

553
00:38:53,664 --> 00:38:56,226
I DON'T KNOW VERY MUCH ABOUT
THIS WHOLE SITUATION.

554
00:38:56,226 --> 00:38:58,192
BUT I HAVE A CLOSE FRIEND WHO IS RUSSIAN

555
00:38:58,192 --> 00:39:00,830
AND I HAVE ASKED HER
WHAT SHE THOUGHT ABOUT IT.
AND SHE SAID,

556
00:39:00,830 --> 00:39:04,112
"MICHAEL, YOU
DON'T PAY ME TO TALK, BABY."

557
00:39:08,241 --> 00:39:13,625
I AM -- I AM VERY IMPRESSED BY
ALL THE UKRAINIAN CITIZENS
SIGNING UP TO DEFEND THEIR COUNTRY,

558
00:39:13,625 --> 00:39:16,087
EVEN THE FAMOUS ONES.
IMAGINE THAT HERE.

559
00:39:16,087 --> 00:39:19,411
CHE JOINED

560
00:39:19,411 --> 00:39:21,950
LOST

561
00:39:22,823 --> 00:39:27,687
>> ONE OF THE FIRST PLACES
RUSSIAN FORCES SEIZED WHEN
INVADING UKRAINE WAS CHERNOBYL,

562
00:39:27,687 --> 00:39:30,473
THE SITE OF THE 1986 NUCLEAR
DISASTER.

563
00:39:30,473 --> 00:39:34,494
SAID UKRAINIANS, "OH, NO.
DON'T TAKE THAT."

564
00:39:36,611 --> 00:39:42,249
CAPTURING CHERNOBYL IS LIKE
LANDING AN AUDITION FOR
HARVEY WEINSTEIN NOW.

565
00:39:45,023 --> 00:39:48,243
TRANS

566
00:39:48,243 --> 00:39:52,412
DONALD TRUMP PRAISED
VLADIMIR PUTIN MOVING TROOPS
INTO UKRAINE,

567
00:39:52,412 --> 00:39:54,165
SAYING, "THIS IS
GENIUS."

568
00:39:54,242 --> 00:39:59,825
"THIS IS GENIUS" IS ALSO HOW HE
SARCASTICALLY INTRODUCES ERIC.

569
00:40:01,983 --> 00:40:07,935
>>> JUDGE KETANJI BROWN JACKSON
SEEN HERE GETTING TIRED OF
Y'ALL'S FOOLISHNESS

570
00:40:07,935 --> 00:40:15,400
WAS
NOMINATED BY PRESIDENT BIDEN TO
BECOME THE FIRST BLACK WOMAN ON
THE SUPREME COURT.

571
00:40:19,871 --> 00:40:24,823
THE NOMINATION FULFILLING
BIDEN'S PROMISE TO CHANGE THE
SUBJECT.

572
00:40:25,154 --> 00:40:28,403
CLAP

573
00:40:28,403 --> 00:40:32,483
>> BIDEN CHOSE JACKSON AFTER
INTERVIEWING THREE FINALISTS
THIS WEEK.

574
00:40:32,483 --> 00:40:35,913
WEIRD.
"I THOUGHT INTERVIEWING BLACK
CANDIDATES WAS JUST FOR SHOW,"

575
00:40:35,913 --> 00:40:37,961
SAID THE NFL.

576
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:43,819
>>> A NEW BOOK CLAIMS THAT WHILE
DONALD TRUMP WAS PRESIDENT,

577
00:40:43,819 --> 00:40:49,029
WHITE HOUSE STAFF ROUTINELY FOUND WADS OF
PAPER CLOGGING THE TOILET.

578
00:40:49,029 --> 00:40:52,394
SO EITHER HE TRIED TO FLUSH
CLASSIFIED DOCUMENTS,

579
00:40:52,394 --> 00:40:55,361
OR HE EATS
THE WRAPPERS.

580
00:40:57,741 --> 00:41:01,015
IN A DAYS AFTER NEY-YORK MAYOR ERIC ADAMS

581
00:41:01,015 --> 00:41:04,646
ANNOUNCED THE
NEW PLAN TO STOP VIOLENCE IN THE
CITY'S TRANSIT SYSTEM,

582
00:41:04,646 --> 00:41:07,028
SIX
PEOPLE WERE STABBED ON THE
SUBWAY.

583
00:41:07,028 --> 00:41:11,451
AND I SPEAK FOR ALL NEW YORKERS

729
00:52:15,656 --> 00:52:18,367
>> OKAY.

00:52:19,688 --> 00:52:22,122
>> HEY, TRACY.

732
00:52:22,122 --> 00:52:25,647
YOU GOT A RUBIX CUBE?
>> NOT REALLY.
I'M COLOR BLIND.

733
00:52:25,647 --> 00:52:29,270
>> WAIT.
YOU'RE COLOR BLIND AND YOUR
PARENTS ARE DIVORCED?

734
00:52:29,270 --> 00:52:32,058
NO WONDER YOU DON'T HAVE A
BOYFRIEND.

735
00:52:32,482 --> 00:52:37,664
>> AGAIN, THIS IS FROM 1980 WHEN
TV WAS CRAZY.

736
00:52:37,664 --> 00:52:38,858
>> YOU KNOW, I HAVE ALWAYS

737
00:52:38,858 --> 00:52:41,308
WONDERED, WHO EXACTLY IS THIS
RUBIK GUY.

738
00:52:41,308 --> 00:52:44,080
>> HUH.

739
00:52:44,303 --> 00:52:47,418
OH, MY GOD!
THAT WAS LIKE CONCRETE.

740
00:52:47,418 --> 00:52:49,693
>> I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU SAID, "I

741
00:52:49,693 --> 00:52:51,615
OOPS.

742
00:52:53,325 --> 00:52:55,206
>> OH, GEEZ.

743
00:52:55,206 --> 00:52:58,807
>> SORRY!
LITTLE BASTARD SLIPPED OUT OF MY
HANDS.

744
00:52:58,807 --> 00:53:01,884
YEAH.
SLIME IS TOO DAMN THICK.

745
00:53:02,957 --> 00:53:08,169
>> FUN FACT.
THAT WOMAN WITH THE BUSTED ASS
HAIR CUT IS BECKY.

746
00:53:08,169 --> 00:53:13,152
>> THE EARLY DAYS ALSO SAW
EXPERMITATION IN THE METHODS OF SLIMING,

747
00:53:13,152 --> 00:53:16,382
AS SEEN IN THIS CLIP
FROM AN EARLY EPISODE.

748
00:53:16,382 --> 00:53:19,073

SUZANNE SUMMERS.

749
00:53:19,073 --> 00:53:22,978
>> IT'S MARK SUMMERS.

751
00:53:26,961 --> 00:53:31,169
THIS SPIDERMAN COMIC GOT ME
THINKING, YOU'D BE A GREAT
SUPERHERO.

752
00:53:31,241 --> 00:53:33,265
STUFFED HER BRA WOMAN.

753
00:53:33,265 --> 00:53:37,941
>> OH, WELL YOU CAN BE MY
SIDEKICK, THE INCREDIBLE HOMO.

754
00:53:37,941 --> 00:53:42,199
>> 1980.

755
00:53:43,062 --> 00:53:45,310
>> NO.
I PREFER SUPER CRAIG.

756
00:53:45,310 --> 00:53:49,087
>> HUH.
AND WHAT'S SUPER CRAIG'S SUPER
POWER?

757
00:53:49,087 --> 00:53:51,735
>> HA, I DON'T KNOW. I GUESS --

758
00:53:52,842 --> 00:53:55,940
JESUS CHRIST.

759
00:53:57,900 --> 00:54:02,621
LOOKS LIKE SUPER CRAIG'S SUPER
POWER IS BEING SLIMED.

760
00:54:04,405 --> 00:54:07,171
>> WHY DID THEY DO THAT TO ME?

761
00:54:07,171 --> 00:54:10,406
>> I DON'T KNOW, BUT THEY JUST

762
00:54:10,406 --> 00:54:14,427
DAMMIT, STOP, PLEASE.

763

00:54:20,585 --> 00:54:24,081
YOU KNOW, THE ISSUE IS FIXED,
AND IT WILL NOT HAPPEN AGAIN.

766
00:54:24,952 --> 00:54:28,486
>> OKAY.
STOP.
WE'RE BEGGING YOU.

767
00:54:28,486 --> 00:54:33,284
>> OKAY.
THE SECOND TO LAST EPISODE

768
00:54:33,284 --> 00:54:35,896
SHOWED A GLIMMER OF THE SLIME WE KNOW TODAY,

769
00:54:35,896 --> 00:54:38,453
BUT THERE WERE STILL
SOME ISSUES TO IRON OUT.

770
00:54:38,453 --> 00:54:40,703
SLIME IS ONE STICKY BUSINESS.

771
00:54:40,703 --> 00:54:45,962
>> HELL, YEAH.
JUST LIKE HAVING 18 KIDS WITH
20 DIFFERENT WOMEN.

772
00:54:45,962 --> 00:54:48,146
I'M LOSING MY HAIR.

773
00:54:48,146 --> 00:54:50,363
>> HEY.

00:54:50,363 --> 00:54:54,447
>> GEE, WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU,
ABBIE?
ARE YOU ON YOUR PERIOD OR
SOMETHING?

775
00:54:54,447 --> 00:54:58,354
>> NO.
SHE'S PROBABLY JUST UPSET
BECAUSE SHE'S ADOPTED.

776
00:54:58,746 --> 00:55:01,218
>> I MEAN, DO I GOT TO SAY IT?

777
00:55:01,218 --> 00:55:05,602
>> 1980.
>> THEY KNOW, MAN.

778
00:55:06,100 --> 00:55:10,563
>> I HAVE A QUESTION.
ARE YOU DWEEBS EVER NOT
ANNOYING?

779
00:55:10,563 --> 00:55:12,892
>> HUH.

780
00:55:21,590 --> 00:55:24,536
I FEEL LIKE YOU CAN STOP SOON.

781
00:55:24,536 --> 00:55:26,687
>> IT'S GETTING IN MY EYES RIGHT
NOW.

782
00:55:26,687 --> 00:55:30,453
>> IS IT OKAY IF I GET IT IN MY
MOUTH?

783
00:55:30,453 --> 00:55:34,080
>> PLEASE STOP.
CAN YOU PLEASE?

784
00:55:34,081 --> 00:55:37,322
I FEEL LIKE YOU GOT IT.

785
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:41,192
GOD

786

787
00:55:43,569 --> 00:55:48,792

MINUTES TO FIVE SECONDS.
