00:00:02,926 --> 00:00:04,689
>>> ladies and gentlemen,

2
00:00:04,689 --> 00:00:08,200
the ukrainian chorus of new york.

3
00:01:42,614 --> 00:01:46,401
>>> live from new york, it's
Saturday night.

4
00:03:45,787 --> 00:03:50,983
>>  MUSICAL GUEST,
LCD SOUNDSYSTEM.

5
00:03:50,983 --> 00:03:55,073
AND YOUR HOST, JOHN MULANEY.

6
00:03:58,664 --> 00:04:03,411
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
JOHN MULANEY!

7
00:04:24,766 --> 00:04:28,006
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

8
00:04:28,006 --> 00:04:32,470
IT IS AMAZING TO BE HERE HOSTING
"SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE"
FOR THE
FIFTH TIME.

9
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:33,996
I THANK YOU.

10
00:04:36,053 --> 00:04:40,204
FOR MANY, MANY REASONS, I'M
GRATEFUL TO BE HERE TONIGHT.

11
00:04:40,204 --> 00:04:44,121
AFTER A VERY COMPLICATED YEAR,
IT IS WONDERFUL TO BE IN A PLACE

12
00:04:44,121 --> 00:04:48,261
THAT HAS ALWAYS
EMPHASIZED SOBRIETY AND MENTAL
HEALTH.

13
00:04:48,261 --> 00:04:52,877
SINCE I LAST HOSTED, DIFFERENT
THINGS HAVE HAPPENED.

14
00:04:52,877 --> 00:04:56,951
I -- IN DECEMBER OF 2020,

15
00:04:56,951 --> 00:04:59,714
I WENT TO DINNER AT A FRIEND'S
APARTMENT.

16
00:04:59,714 --> 00:05:01,731
BUT IT WAS NOT DINNER.

17
00:05:01,731 --> 00:05:06,505
IT WAS AN INTERVENTION.
FOR ME.

18
00:05:06,505 --> 00:05:09,631
MY LEAST FAVORITE KIND OF
INTERVENTION.

19
00:05:09,631 --> 00:05:12,385
WHEN I WALKED IN TO MY INTERVENTION,

20
00:05:12,385 --> 00:05:15,593
I KNEW RIGHT AWAY
THAT IT WAS AN INTERVENTION.

21
00:05:15,593 --> 00:05:19,319
DO YOU KNOW HOW BAD OF A DRUG
PROBLEM YOU HAVE TO HAVE

22
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:23,706
IF WHEN
YOU OPEN A DOOR AND SEE PEOPLE GATHERED,
YOUR FIRST THOUGHT IS,

23
00:05:23,706 --> 00:05:26,153
"THIS IS PROBABLY AN
INTERVENTION ABOUT MY DRUG
PROBLEM"?

24
00:05:26,153 --> 00:05:29,284
THERE IS NO OTHER REASON PEOPLE
WOULD BE BEHIND A DOOR.

25
00:05:29,284 --> 00:05:34,624
I WALK IN.
THERE WERE SIX OF MY FRIENDS IN
NEW YORK IN PERSON

26
00:05:34,624 --> 00:05:38,160
AND SIX OF
MY FRIENDS OVER ZOOM FROM L.A.

27
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,080
AND I KNOW YOU MIGHT BE
THINKING, "HEY, IF THAT WAS ME,
I WOULD'VE BEEN LIKE,

28
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:44,101
"IF YOU'RE
SO WORRIED ABOUT ME, HOW COME
YOU DIDN'T FLY IN?"

29
00:05:44,101 --> 00:05:48,561
DON'T WORRY.
I SAID THAT SEVERAL TIMES.

30
00:05:48,561 --> 00:05:52,629
I RANG THAT BELL AS OFTEN AS
POSSIBLE.

31
00:05:52,629 --> 00:05:56,018
I WENT AWAY TO A REHAB, WHICH
WAS A VERY GOOD EXPERIENCE.

32
00:05:56,018 --> 00:05:57,357
I'M VERY GRATEFUL THAT I WENT.

33
00:05:57,357 --> 00:06:02,102
I WAS THERE FOR TWO MONTHS FROM
DECEMBER TO FEBRUARY 2021.

34
00:06:02,102 --> 00:06:04,862
I WAS THERE DURING JANUARY 6th,
THE INTERCEPTION.

35
00:06:04,862 --> 00:06:07,745
WOULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED ON MY
WATCH.

36
00:06:07,745 --> 00:06:09,978
BECAUSE I WOULD HAVE SEEN TO
IT.

37
00:06:09,978 --> 00:06:14,335
WAS THERE EVER AN INSURRECTION
BEFORE I WENT TO REHAB?
NO.

38
00:06:14,335 --> 00:06:17,988
HAS THERE BEEN ONE SINCE I GOT
OUT?
ABSOLUTELY NOT.

39
00:06:17,988 --> 00:06:19,509
THEY WOULDN'T DARE.

40
00:06:19,509 --> 00:06:22,607
THEY KNOW BABY JAY IS BACK ON
THE STREETS.

41
00:06:23,229 --> 00:06:26,553
LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT ONE THING
YOU DO IN REHAB, OKAY?

42
00:06:26,553 --> 00:06:28,491
YOU SIT DOWN WITH A COUNSELOR

43
00:06:28,491 --> 00:06:32,578
AND YOU DELETE AND BLOCK
ANY DRUG DEALER'S NUMBERS.

44
00:06:32,578 --> 00:06:35,404
IN SOME CASES, YOU REACH OUT TO
DEALERS AND YOU SAY,

45
00:06:35,404 --> 00:06:38,146
"PLEASE
NEVER CONTACT WITH ME AGAIN."

46
00:06:38,146 --> 00:06:40,137
IT'S CALLED "BREAKING UP WITH
YOUR DRUG DEALER."

47
00:06:40,137 --> 00:06:43,066
SO I DID THIS ONE AFTERNOON.
I SAT DOWN WITH A COUNSELOR.

48
00:06:43,066 --> 00:06:45,408
I TEXTED MY MAIN DEALER ARVIN
FIRST.

49
00:06:45,408 --> 00:06:47,000
I SHOULDN'T HAVE SAID HIS NAME.

50
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,353
THAT'S OKAY.
YOU DON'T KNOW HIM.

51
00:06:50,353 --> 00:06:53,266
SO I TEXT ARVIN, AND I SAY,

52
00:06:53,266 --> 00:06:55,699
"HEY, IT'S ME.
I'M DELETING AND BLOCKING YOU.

53
00:06:55,699 --> 00:06:59,086
I'M SOBER NOW.
I'M NEVER GOING TO BUY DRUGS
FROM YOU AGAIN."

54
00:06:59,086 --> 00:07:02,677
AND THEN I'M REALLY POLITE, SO I
DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO END THE TEXT.

55
00:07:02,677 --> 00:07:08,756
SO I WAS LIKE, "BUT THANK YOU
FOR ALL OF THE NIGHTS THAT BECAME DAYS

56
00:07:08,756 --> 00:07:12,263
AND YOUR INSPIRED
PROFESSIONALISM."

57
00:07:12,397 --> 00:07:14,091
I SEND THE TEXT, ALL RIGHT?

58
00:07:14,091 --> 00:07:17,307
BEFORE I CAN DELETE AND BLOCK
HIM, HE TEXTS ME BACK.

59
00:07:17,307 --> 00:07:21,315
HE GOES, "HEY, I'M SO PROUD OF
YOU.

60
00:07:21,315 --> 00:07:24,722
I'M SO HAPPY YOU GOT SOBER."

61
00:07:24,722 --> 00:07:29,154
YOU KNOW, I
ONLY BOUGHT DRUGS TO SELL TO YOU

62
00:07:29,154 --> 00:07:31,805
BECAUSE I WAS WORRIED ABOUT YOU

63
00:07:31,805 --> 00:07:35,882
AND I DIDN'T WANT YOU TO GET
WORSE STUFF OFF THE STREET."

64
00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:41,927
I KNOW!
AND I'M BREAKING UP WITH THIS
GUY?

65
00:07:42,578 --> 00:07:46,976
SO I CAN'T BLOCK HIM NOW.
I TEXT HIM BACK, YOU KNOW?

66
00:07:48,149 --> 00:07:52,105
AND I GO, "OH, MY GOD.
YOU SWEET MAN."

67
00:07:52,105 --> 00:07:55,784
I SAID, "YOU ONLY BOUGHT
DRUGS TO SELL TO ME?"

68
00:07:55,784 --> 00:07:57,569
HE SAYS "YEAH."

69
00:07:57,569 --> 00:08:01,699
I SAID, "DID YOU SELL DRUGS TO
OTHER PEOPLE?"

70
00:08:01,699 --> 00:08:03,858
HE SAID "NO."

71
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:07,349
I SAID, "THIS IS A WEIRD TIME TO
ASK.

72
00:08:07,349 --> 00:08:09,985
BUT ARE YOU A DRUG DEALER?"

73
00:08:10,437 --> 00:08:15,371
HE SAID, "NO.
I'M A PAINTER.
WE TALKED ABOUT THIS."

74
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:22,625
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I HAVE NO IDEA

75
00:08:22,625 --> 00:08:24,969
HOW I KNOW THIS PERSON.

76
00:08:25,712 --> 00:08:27,886
SO I TEXT HIM.

77
00:08:27,886 --> 00:08:33,154
I GO, "HOW DID IT COME TO BE

78
00:08:33,444 --> 00:08:36,456
THAT YOU SELL ME DRUGS?"

79
00:08:36,456 --> 00:08:42,375
AND HE WROTE BACK, "I DON'T
KNOW.
YOU JUST KEPT ASKING."

80
00:08:42,556 --> 00:08:44,709
I LIKE THAT STORY

81
00:08:44,709 --> 00:08:47,682
BECAUSE THERE ARE MANY TALES OF DRUG DEALERS

82
00:08:47,682 --> 00:08:51,154
WHO HAVE TURNED INNOCENT PEOPLE
INTO DRUG ADDICTS.

83
00:08:51,255 --> 00:08:53,993
I MIGHT BE THE FIRST DRUG ADDICT

84
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:58,450
TO TURN AN INNOCENT MAN INTO A
DRUG DEALER.

85
00:08:58,451 --> 00:09:01,851
PROMISE

86
00:09:04,914 --> 00:09:07,801
LIFE IS A LOT BETTER AND HAPPIER
NOW.

87
00:09:07,801 --> 00:09:09,469
I HAVE A 12-WEEK-OLD SON.

88
00:09:09,469 --> 00:09:11,760
I'M VERY EXCITED.
YES.

89
00:09:13,099 --> 00:09:16,192
HE'S A PRETTY COOL GUY FOR
SOMEONE WHO CAN'T VOTE.

90
00:09:16,192 --> 00:09:19,918
HE HAS -- HIS LEGS ARE LIKE
LITTLE CALZONES, AND I WANT TO
EAT THEM.

91
00:09:19,919 --> 00:09:21,716
MALCOLM

92
00:09:21,716 --> 00:09:26,000
LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT
THE MOMENT I FIRST BONDED THE
HARDEST WITH MALCOLM.

93
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,339
WE'RE IN THE DELIVERY ROOM.
MY GIRLFRIEND GIVES BIRTH TO
HIM.

94
00:09:29,339 --> 00:09:30,708
AND HE'S CRYING A LITTLE.

95
00:09:30,708 --> 00:09:33,977
AND THEY BRING HIM OVER TO THIS
WARMER.

96
00:09:33,977 --> 00:09:37,110
AND THEY PUT HIM UNDER THIS WARMER,
UNDER THIS BIG BRIGHT LIGHT

97
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:39,948
AND LIGHT
THAT'S SHINING IN
HIS FACE.
REALLY BRIGHT

98
00:09:39,949 --> 00:09:41,760
AND -- AND MALCOLM,

99
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:45,024
HE JUST LOOKS AND HE GOES --

100
00:09:49,544 --> 00:09:54,474
HE WAS
ANNOYED, BUT HE DIDN'T SAY
ANYTHING.

101
00:09:54,474 --> 00:09:57,456
AND I WAS LIKE, "THAT'S MY SON."

102
00:09:57,613 --> 00:10:01,235
A POLITE MAN IN AN UNCOMFORTABLE
SITUATION,

103
00:10:01,235 --> 00:10:03,001
BUT HE'S NOT
GOING TO MAKE A FUSS.

104
00:10:03,001 --> 00:10:05,069
AND IT WAS A SUPER BRIGHT LIGHT.

105
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:06,851
ME

106
00:10:06,851 --> 00:10:08,907
HE'D NEVER SEEN ANY LIGHT IN HIS
LIFE.

107
00:10:08,907 --> 00:10:13,645
IT'S FUNNY -- IT'S FUNNY TO SEE
ON A BABY'S FACE THE
EXPRESSION -- JESUS WITH THE
LIGHTS.

108
00:10:13,645 --> 00:10:15,288
MALCOLM IS A VERY GOOD BABY,

109
00:10:15,288 --> 00:10:18,626
HIS FAVORITE PASSIFIER JUST GOT
RECALLED, THOUGH.

110
00:10:18,626 --> 00:10:21,191
IT'S SUCH A BUMMER.
HE LOVED IT.

111
00:10:21,191 --> 00:10:25,243
SO WE HAVE A DOZEN OF THEM.
WE STILL HAVE THEM ON A BASKET
ON THE COUNTER.

112
00:10:25,243 --> 00:10:27,730
AND I CAN SEE THIS LOOK IN HIS
EYES, ALWAYS LIKE,

113
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:31,450
"OH, I WANT
TO USE THOSE, BUT I CAN'T
BECAUSE THEY COULD KILL ME."

114
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:34,237
I'M LIKE, "WELCOME TO MY WORLD,
HOMIE."

115
00:10:37,023 --> 00:10:40,374
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WE HAVE A
GREAT SHOW.

116
00:10:40,374 --> 00:10:43,073
LCD

117
00:10:43,073 --> 00:10:46,851
STICK

118
00:10:54,926 --> 00:10:57,535
>>> THANKS AGAIN FOR TAKING MY
CASE.

119
00:10:57,535 --> 00:10:58,919
>> HOW COULD I NOT?

120
00:10:58,919 --> 00:11:04,449
YOUR NEIGHBOR KEEPS A WILD
MONKEY IN A RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD

121
00:11:04,449 --> 00:11:08,240
AND YOU GO OVER TO
SAY "HI" AND GET MAULED.
IT'S NOT RIGHT.

122
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,925
>> DO YOU THINK WE'LL GET A
SETTLEMENT?
>> ABSOLUTELY.

123
00:11:10,925 --> 00:11:13,007
UNLESS WE WIND UP
WITH THE WRONG JUDGE.

124
00:11:13,007 --> 00:11:17,627
>> OH, YAY.
OH, YAY.
ALL RISE!
THE HONORABLE JUDGE ZENGO
PRESIDING.

125
00:11:22,010 --> 00:11:26,451
>> YEP.
THAT'S A
TOUGH BREAK.
WE GOT THE MONKEY JUDGE.

126
00:11:26,451 --> 00:11:28,184
>> A MONKEY JUDGE?

127
00:11:28,184 --> 00:11:31,984
>> YEAH.
HE WAS APPOINTED LAST YEAR BY
THAT GOVERNOR WHO LOVES PRANKS

128
00:11:31,984 --> 00:11:34,244
AND STRUGGLED WITH ADDICTION.

129
00:11:34,244 --> 00:11:37,115
>> PLEASE BE SEATED.

130
00:11:37,115 --> 00:11:39,776
NO ONE LOOK ME IN THE EYE.

131
00:11:39,776 --> 00:11:42,788
DO NOT MAKE ANY NOISES THAT I
DON'T KNOW.

132
00:11:42,788 --> 00:11:46,367
I DON'T FEEL CORNERED, SO WE CAN
BEGIN.

133
00:11:46,367 --> 00:11:49,503
I HAVE DECIDED TO ALLOW CAMERAS
IN THIS COURTROOM.

134
00:11:49,503 --> 00:11:52,461
HOWEVER, IF I SEE MY IMAGE IN THE MONITOR,

135
00:11:52,461 --> 00:11:57,056
I WILL THINK
IT IS A RIVAL MONKEY AND I WILL
COMPLETELY LOSE IT.

136
00:11:57,056 --> 00:12:01,754
NOW, ALSO, LET THE RECORD SHOW
THAT I AM ALREADY VERY CLOSE TO
COMPLETELY LOSIN

137
00:12:01,754 --> 00:12:06,111
IN THE BLUE WITH THE GRAY.

138
00:12:06,111 --> 00:12:07,874
PROCEED.

139
00:12:07,874 --> 00:12:09,768
>> THANK YOU, YOUR HONOR.

140
00:12:09,768 --> 00:12:14,411
MY CLIENT WENT OVER TO SAY
"HELLO" TO THE DEFENDANT AND HIS
PET MONKEY, GUMMO.

141
00:12:14,411 --> 00:12:16,561
>> NO GUMMO.

142
00:12:16,561 --> 00:12:19,579
>> WHAT?
>> TENGO.

143
00:12:19,867 --> 00:12:23,154
>> YEAH.
I KNOW.
I'M TALKING ABOUT A DIFFERENT
MONKEY.

144
00:12:23,154 --> 00:12:25,791
>> YEAH, YEAH.
NO GUMMO.
TENGO.

145
00:12:25,791 --> 00:12:27,482
>> SHOULD I KEEP GOING?

146
00:12:27,482 --> 00:12:31,648
>> YEAH.
BUT I'M GOT TO THROW A LITTLE
SAND TO SHOW DOMINANCE.

147
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:34,186
>> ALL RIGHT.
OKAY.

148
00:12:34,186 --> 00:12:37,645
SO MY CLIENT WAS AT THE
DEFENDANT'S HOUSE

149
00:12:37,645 --> 00:12:40,353
WHEN OUT OF
NOWHERE, HIS PET MONKEY GRABBED
HER HAT AND --

150
00:12:40,353 --> 00:12:42,129
>> WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA,
WHOA.

151
00:12:42,129 --> 00:12:47,044
WAS IT THE SAME HAT YOU NORMALLY
WEAR, OR WAS IT ANY DIFFERENT?

152
00:12:47,044 --> 00:12:49,690
>> WELL, NORMALLY, I WEAR AN
ORANGE BUCKET HAT,

153
00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:52,052
AND THIS
TIME, I HAD ON A GREEN BASEBALL
CAP.

154
00:12:52,052 --> 00:12:53,367
>> LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT,

155
00:12:53,367 --> 00:12:56,603
YOU WALKED UP TO THIS MONKEY AS A
DIFFERENT SHAPE

156
00:12:56,603 --> 00:12:59,619
AND YOU
EXPECTED, WHAT, HIM TO JUST BE
COOL WITH THAT?

157
00:12:59,619 --> 00:13:03,100
FOR YOU TO NOT FEEL HIS INSANE
BREATH ON YOUR FACE

158
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:06,945
WHILE HE
BROKE ALL THE BONES IN YOUR BODY
WITH THE STRENGTH OF 30 MEN.

159
00:13:06,945 --> 00:13:10,083
>> WELL, HE'S IN A HANGING MOOD
TODAY.

160
00:13:10,083 --> 00:13:12,448
>> ARE YOU SURE?
HE'S SMILING.

161
00:13:12,448 --> 00:13:15,664
>> NO, HE'S BARING HIS TEETH.

162
00:13:17,887 --> 00:13:21,619
>> IT'S HOPELESS.
SO WHO CAN REASON WITH A JUDGE
LIKE THIS?

163
00:13:21,619 --> 00:13:26,677
>> MAY THE DEFENSE APPROACH THE
BENCH IN A SLOW, DELIBERATE WAY

164
00:13:26,677 --> 00:13:29,126
HOLDING A BIRTHDAY CAKE?

165
00:13:29,126 --> 00:13:34,226
>> THE COURT RECOGNIZES THE
SHAPE HE NORMALLY ASSOCIATES
WITH TREATS.

166
00:13:34,226 --> 00:13:39,124
>> AS I APPROACH, YOUR HONOR,
I'D LIKE TO NOTIFY THE COURT

167
00:13:39,124 --> 00:13:42,334
THAT I AM WEARING PERFUME, BUT I
AM NOT FRUIT.

168
00:13:42,334 --> 00:13:45,238
>> THE COURT APPRECIATES THE
CLARIFICATION.

169
00:13:45,238 --> 00:13:50,826
I WILL TAKE THIS CAKE, AND I
WILL PLACE IT IN MY PILE OF
SHREDDED NEWSPAPER.

170
00:13:50,826 --> 00:13:53,974
AND I WILL ALSO TAKE THIS SHINY
THING.

171
00:13:53,974 --> 00:13:59,512
LET THE RECORD SHOW THAT THIS
SHINY
THING WAS HIS AND NOW IT'S MINE.

172
00:13:59,512 --> 00:14:03,487
AND IT GOES IN THE NEWSPAPER WITH THE CAKE,

173
00:14:03,487 --> 00:14:09,197
SO NOW I HAVE WON
MANY THINGS AND I KNOW VISUALLY
WHAT I HAVE.

174
00:14:09,197 --> 00:14:11,321
>> YOU ARE THE ALPHA.
>> YES.

175
00:14:11,321 --> 00:14:15,803
>> OBJECTION!
YOUR HONOR, IT IS OBVIOUS THAT
YOU'RE FAVORING THE DEFENSE.

176
00:14:15,803 --> 00:14:17,613
>> THAT IS RIDICULOUS.

177
00:14:17,613 --> 00:14:21,227
>> YOUR HONOR?
I LOVE JUDGE.

178
00:14:21,227 --> 00:14:23,136
>> I LOVE YOU.

179
00:14:23,136 --> 00:14:25,758
>> I LOVE JUDGE.

180
00:14:25,758 --> 00:14:29,095
>> YOU ARE BABY.
JUDGE LOVE BABY.

181
00:14:29,095 --> 00:14:31,485
BRING JUDGE BABY.
JUDGE LOVE YOU.

182
00:14:31,485 --> 00:14:32,779
JUDGE FAVOR DEFENSE.

183
00:14:32,779 --> 00:14:37,114
>> COME ON!
>> YEAH.
WE MOVE TO REQUEST A NEW JUDGE.

184
00:14:37,114 --> 00:14:40,008
>> ARE YOU SUGGESTING THAT I'M
NOT COMPETENT?

185
00:14:40,008 --> 00:14:43,438
TENGO MADE THESE PIECES MATCH.

186
00:14:43,438 --> 00:14:46,946
SURE IT WAS A BIT OF TRIAL AND
ERROR, BUT I DID IT.

187
00:14:46,946 --> 00:14:49,692
I WON THE JUTE.

188
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:54,836
I'M GETTING TIRED AND I FEEL
SLIGHTLY CORNERED

189
00:14:54,836 --> 00:14:57,401
AND THIS IS
ALL GETTING SO, SO DANGEROUS.

190
00:14:57,401 --> 00:14:59,461
SO I'M
JUST GOING TO DISMISS THE
ENTIRE --

191
00:14:59,461 --> 00:15:02,012
>> WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
I WOULD LIKE TO CALL A SURPRISE
WITNESS.

192
00:15:02,012 --> 00:15:06,447
>> UNLESS THAT SURPRISE WITNESS
IS A RATTY OLD STUFFED ANIMAL
FOR ME TO VIOLATE,

193
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:10,733
I ASSURE YOU
THE COURT IS NOT INTERESTED IN
BEING STARTLED.

194
00:15:10,733 --> 00:15:14,395
>> WELL, I GOT SOME GOOD NEWS
FOR YOU, JUDGE.

195
00:15:14,395 --> 00:15:17,814
>> THAT SIDE WINS.
THAT SIDE WINS.

196
00:15:18,926 --> 00:15:21,019
>>> NEXT ON "MONKEY JUDGE,"

197
00:15:21,019 --> 00:15:25,119
A PUBLIC URINATOR MARKED THE
WRONG TERRITORY GETS THE MAXIMUM
PENALTY.

198
00:15:25,119 --> 00:15:27,181
HIS PENIS RIPPED CLEAN OFF OF HIS
BODY.

199
00:15:27,181 --> 00:15:29,000
MONKEY JUDGE.

200
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:35,699
SORRY

201
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:39,102
>> REBECCA, HI.

202
00:15:39,102 --> 00:15:41,713
LOOKS LIKE WE'RE BOTH BUYING DOG
FOOD TODAY.

203
00:15:41,713 --> 00:15:44,013
>> WELL, NOT REALLY.

204
00:15:44,013 --> 00:15:47,159
I'M BUYING BLUE RIVER DOG FOOD,
WHICH IS REAL FOOD

205
00:15:47,159 --> 00:15:50,217
WHICH MY
GUNTHER REALLY APPRECIATES.
RIGHT, BUDDY?

206
00:15:50,217 --> 00:15:54,299
AND HAVE YOU EVER LOOKED AT THE
INGREDIENTS ON THAT BIG NAME
BRAND DOG FOOD YOU'RE BUYING?

207
00:15:54,299 --> 00:15:55,830
>> IT SEEMED FINE TO ME.
>> REALLY?

208
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:59,576
OKAY.
WELL, THEN, WHY DON'T YOU READ
THEM OUT LOUD IN FRONT OF YOUR
DOG.

209
00:15:59,576 --> 00:16:02,374
>> OKAY.
CORN, CHICKEN.

210
00:16:02,374 --> 00:16:04,740
>> GO ON.
CONTINUE.
>> CORN GLUTEN MEAL.

211
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:08,432
>> SORRY, WHAT IS THAT "CORN
GLUTEN MEAL?"
>> NO, I THINK YOU HEARD ME.

212
00:16:08,432 --> 00:16:11,344
>> HOW MUCH DO YOU PAY FOR BLUE
RIVER?
LIKE $80.

213
00:16:11,344 --> 00:16:14,488
>> IT'S NOT $80, IT'S $73.99.

214
00:16:14,488 --> 00:16:18,352
IT'S ACTUALLY ONLY 32 CENTS MORE
A DAY THAN YOU WHAT YOU PAY
MONTHLY.
>> NO, IT'S NOT.

215
00:16:18,352 --> 00:16:23,026
>> ACTUALLY, IT IS.
IF YOU TAKE THE DIFFERENCE IN
THE PRICES BETWEEN THE TWO BAGS
AND DIVIDE THAT BY 28.

216
00:16:23,026 --> 00:16:26,211
28 DAYS IN A MONTH, RIGHT?
7 DAYS IN A WEEK, CORRECT?
CORRECT?

217
00:16:26,211 --> 00:16:27,914
>> CORRECT.
>> CORRECT.
YOU AGREE.
>> I SHOULD BE GOING.

218
00:16:27,914 --> 00:16:30,535
>> YEAH, OKAY.
28.
28 DAYS.
4 WEEKS IS A MONTH, RIGHT?

219
00:16:30,535 --> 00:16:33,291
SO DIVIDE IT BY 28, WHICH WE
BOTH AGREED IS A MONTH.
>> YES.

220
00:16:33,291 --> 00:16:36,333
>> IT COMES OUT TO 32 CENTS A
DAY MONTHLY.

221
00:16:36,333 --> 00:16:41,401
>> I GUESS I WOULDN'T BE
BRAGGING ABOUT ALL THIS SAVINGS
BECAUSE IT IS NOT AS MUCH AS YOU
THINK.

222
00:16:41,401 --> 00:16:43,445
>> NO, THAT MATH DOESN'T MAKE
SENSE.

223
00:16:43,445 --> 00:16:45,812
>> OH, YOU DON'T THINK SO?
WELL, WHY DON'T WE ASK MY
HUSBAND.
DANIEL.

224
00:16:45,812 --> 00:16:47,035
>> OH, MY GOD, I DON'T CARE.

225
00:16:47,035 --> 00:16:51,613
>> OH, MY GOD.
YOU'RE NOT PLANNING ON FEEDING
THAT TO YOUR FUR BABY, ARE YOU?

226
00:16:51,613 --> 00:16:53,880
>> SHE LIKES IT, OKAY?
AND I'M SAVING MONEY.

227
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,227
>> 32 CENTS A DAY MONTHLY?

228
00:16:55,227 --> 00:16:59,096
THAT'S WORTH IT TO YOU?
FOR YOU DOG NOT TO BE ABLE TO
WALK?

229
00:17:00,012 --> 00:17:02,869
>> OH, MY GOD.
THAT'S --

230
00:17:02,869 --> 00:17:06,067
THAT'S WHY THE DOG HAS BEEN IN
THIS STUPID CART.

231
00:17:06,067 --> 00:17:10,080
IT CAN'T WALK.
BECAUSE OF THE FOOD.

232
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:12,456
THE DOG HAS JUST BEEN SITTING
THERE IN THE CART

233
00:17:12,456 --> 00:17:16,269
AND LIKE I
THINK SUBCONSCIOUSLY I KNEW WHAT
THAT MEANT THE WHOLE TIME.

234
00:17:16,269 --> 00:17:20,336
BUT I WASN'T EVEN READY TO SHOW
THAT TO MYSELF, TO SHOW ME THAT.

235
00:17:20,336 --> 00:17:21,863
>> OKAY.
LOOK, SHE CAN WALK.

236
00:17:21,863 --> 00:17:25,227
>> PEOPLE LIKE YOU SHOULD BE
HUNG IN A PUBLIC SQUARE.

237
00:17:25,227 --> 00:17:27,798
>> LOOK AT ME.
I CAN FIX THIS.

238
00:17:27,798 --> 00:17:30,624
>> I JUST FEEL LIKE THESE
ANIMALS HAVE NO VOICE.

239
00:17:30,624 --> 00:17:32,507
WHO WILL BE THEIR VOICE?

240
00:17:32,507 --> 00:17:37,390
>> YOU WILL.

241
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:37,144
REBECCA ANN BUSH, LOOK AT ME.

242
00:17:37,568 --> 00:17:40,051
LOOK AT GUNTHER.

243
00:17:41,121 --> 00:17:43,636
LOOK AT PRIME TIME.

244
00:17:43,921 --> 00:17:46,204
LOOK AT WANTON.

245
00:17:46,914 --> 00:17:49,595
LOOK AT ALEXANDER.

246
00:17:49,595 --> 00:17:54,982
YOU ALWAYS, ALWAYS HAVE BEEN
THEIR ADVOCATES AND THEIR VOICE,

247
00:17:54,982 --> 00:17:58,811
MORE THAN ANYONE, ANYONE WHO
EVER LIVED.

248
00:17:58,811 --> 00:18:01,601
>> I KNOW.
I KNOW.
BUT I FEEL LIKE IT'S TOO LATE.

249
00:18:01,601 --> 00:18:04,680
I MEAN, THE DOG CAN'T WALK.
IT IS JUST SITTING THERE
HUMILIATED.

250
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:09,451
>> IT WILL WALK IF IT STARTS
EATING BLUE RIVER TODAY.

251
00:18:09,451 --> 00:18:13,167
NOW, FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, LOOK
YOUR DOG IN THE EYE

252
00:18:13,167 --> 00:18:15,571
AND LISTEN
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN YOUR LIFE.

253
00:18:15,571 --> 00:18:20,219
>> FINE.
FELICITY, WHAT DO YOU WANT?

254
00:18:20,809 --> 00:18:24,272
>> I WANT BLUE RIVER DOG FOOD,
MOMMA.

255
00:18:24,272 --> 00:18:27,584
I WANT TO WALK.

256
00:18:27,584 --> 00:18:30,529
IT'S ONLY 32 CENTS MORE A DAY.

257
00:18:30,529 --> 00:18:33,406
I DON'T WANT A CORN
GLUTEN MEAL.

258
00:18:33,406 --> 00:18:35,459
LISTEN

259
00:18:36,215 --> 00:18:40,082
>> DO IT!
DO THE RIGHT THING!
IT'S NOT TOO LATE.

260
00:18:40,082 --> 00:18:44,022
>> OH, MY GOD.
FINE.
I WILL BUY THE BLUE RIVER, OKAY?

261
00:18:45,713 --> 00:18:48,779
MAY I GO NOW, PLEASE?
>> DEFINITELY.

262
00:18:48,779 --> 00:18:52,214
>> WE JUST SAVED THAT DOG'S
LIFE.

263
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:54,315
>> NOT WE.
YOU.

264
00:18:54,315 --> 00:18:56,991
AND YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE?
I THINK I'M READY TO DO IT.

265
00:18:56,991 --> 00:18:59,609
I THINK I'M FINALLY READY TO
MAKE LOVE TO YOU.

266
00:18:59,609 --> 00:19:03,528
>> WHAT?
IT'S WORKING?
>> IF THIS IS WHAT I THINK IT
IS, IT'S WORKING.

267
00:19:03,528 --> 00:19:06,822
>> EVERYONE, HE SAYS IT'S
WORKING!

268
00:19:07,049 --> 00:19:08,659
>> CONGRATULATIONS!

269
00:19:08,659 --> 00:19:12,336
>> I CAN REALLY THANK YOU, YEAH.

270
00:19:12,336 --> 00:19:17,049
>> BLUE RIVER DOG FOOD.
IF YOU WANT YOUR DOG TO EVER
WALK AGAIN.

271
00:19:20,707 --> 00:19:22,805
>> I'M SO GLAD WE'RE DOING THIS.

272
00:19:22,805 --> 00:19:25,140
MY FAVORITE RESTAURANT WITH MY
FAVORITE PEOPLE.

273
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:28,186
>> 100%.

274
00:19:28,186 --> 00:19:31,935
>> YOU KNOW WHAT?
THIS IS SO FUN.
DINNER IS ON US.

275
00:19:31,935 --> 00:19:36,581
>> WOW.
BUT YOU KNOW YOU CAN TAKE YOUR
MASK OFF AT THE TABLE.

276
00:19:36,581 --> 00:19:39,824
>> I'M SORRY.
I DON'T KNOW I'M WEARING IT HALF
THE TIME.

277
00:19:39,824 --> 00:19:43,247
>> WELL, I HEARD THE CDC IS
GOING TO LIFT ALL MASK MANDATES
SO --

278
00:19:43,248 --> 00:19:45,171
KNOW

279
00:19:45,171 --> 00:19:49,848
>> THAT'S SO WEIRD.
IT'S LIKE COVID'S NOT OVER, BUT
WE'RE ALL JUST GONNA STOP?

280
00:19:49,848 --> 00:19:51,651
I DON'T KNOW HOW I FEEL ABOUT
THAT.
>> YEAH.

281
00:19:51,651 --> 00:19:53,938
>> OH, YOU KNOW WHAT?
THAT REMINDS ME OF AN ARTICLE I
READ.

282
00:19:53,938 --> 00:19:56,027
>> OH, HONEY, NO ONE WANTS TO
HEAR ABOUT THAT.

283
00:19:56,027 --> 00:19:59,550
>> WELL, IT WAS IN BLOOMBERG AND
I THOUGHT IT WAS INTERESTING.

284
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:02,036
>> WHAT, UH -- WHAT ARTICLE?

285
00:20:02,036 --> 00:20:04,477
>> WELL --
>> HONEY.

286
00:20:04,477 --> 00:20:08,054
IT WAS JUST SAYING HOW MASK
MANDATES HAD, 

287
00:20:08,054 --> 00:20:12,551
I DON'T KNOW,
LITTLE TO NO EFFECT ON COVID.

288
00:20:29,689 --> 00:20:34,202
ANYTHING.

289
00:20:34,202 --> 00:20:37,551
I JUST WONDER IF SOMETIMES ANY
OF THE THINGS WE DID ACTUALLY
HELPED.

290
00:20:37,551 --> 00:20:39,290
>> GINA!
>> NO, NO, NO.

291
00:20:39,290 --> 00:20:44,048
