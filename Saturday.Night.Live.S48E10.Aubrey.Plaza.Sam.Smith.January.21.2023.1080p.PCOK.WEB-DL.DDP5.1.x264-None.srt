1
00:00:13,699 --> 00:00:16,510
>>> HELLO, FOLKS.
ALL RIGHT.

2
00:00:16,615 --> 00:00:19,953
YOU'RE WATCHING THE NFL ON FOX
POSTGAME SHOW.

3
00:00:19,953 --> 00:00:24,729
BOY WAS THAT AN INCREDIBLE
MATCHUP BETWEEN THE EAGLES AND
GIANTS THAT ENDED 12 SECONDS AGO.

4
00:00:24,729 --> 00:00:29,583
SOUTH PHILADELPHIA HAS BEEN SET ON
FIRE, WHICH MEANS THE EAGLES
LOST OR WON.

5
00:00:29,583 --> 00:00:33,523
I'M KURT JOINED AS ALWAYS BY
HALLE LONG.

6
00:00:33,523 --> 00:00:37,722
I HAVE THE GLASSES, SO I AM
THE SMART ONE.

7
00:00:37,722 --> 00:00:40,377
HALL OF FAME COWBOYS COACH
JIMMY JOHNSON.

8
00:00:40,377 --> 00:00:42,521
THAT GUY WAS ON OUR SIDE,

9
00:00:42,521 --> 00:00:46,294
AND I DIDN'T EVEN NEED TO TAKE EXTEND.

10
00:00:46,294 --> 00:00:50,407
NEW YORK GIANTS LEGEND WHO I
KNOW IS ROOTING FOR HIS FORMER TEAM TONIGHT,

11
00:00:50,407 --> 00:00:51,408
MICHAEL STRAHAN.

12
00:00:51,408 --> 00:00:53,484
YEAH, YEAH.

13
00:00:53,584 --> 00:00:59,570
THAT CAME WITH SURPRISING STUPENDOUS

14
00:00:59,576 --> 00:01:04,975
AND I AM SO PROUD OF
MY GIANTS EVEN THOUGH THEY LOST
BY 31 POINTS.

15
00:01:04,975 --> 00:01:08,570
AND FINALLY, STEELERS LEGEND
AND THE WHITE CHARLES BARKLEY,

16
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:09,592
TERRY BRADSHAW.

17
00:01:09,592 --> 00:01:13,618
BOY, THAT GAME WAS A STINKER.

18
00:01:13,618 --> 00:01:17,970
THAT GAME WAS MORE LOPSIDED THAN
MY GRANDMA'S CHEST.

19
00:01:21,021 --> 00:01:22,519
GOOD TO KNOW

20
00:01:22,519 --> 00:01:25,113
AND TERRY, JUST WANTED TO CHECK.

21
00:01:25,113 --> 00:01:30,033
YOU KNOW WE HAVE SOMEONE
AVAILABLE ON SET WHO CAN COMB
YOUR HAIR, RIGHT?

22
00:01:30,111 --> 00:01:32,981
ONLY IF THEY CAN CATCH ME
FIRST.

23
00:01:32,981 --> 00:01:35,721
ALL RIGHT, AND GUYS, THIS IS FUN.

24
00:01:35,721 --> 00:01:39,579
BEFORE THE GAME, WE GAVE THAT
NEW CHATGPT TECHNOLOGY

25
00:01:39,579 --> 00:01:42,074
TO OUR VERY
OWN CLEETUS THE ROBOT.

26
00:01:42,074 --> 00:01:43,965
SAY

27
00:01:43,965 --> 00:01:47,958
WHY DO HUMANS MAKE OTHER
HUMANS PLAY FOOTBALL?

28
00:01:48,019 --> 00:01:51,077
DOES IT NOT SEEM BARBARIC?

29
00:01:51,077 --> 00:01:53,426
UH-OH.
DON'T LOVE THAT.

30
00:01:53,426 --> 00:01:57,297
GUESS WE GOT TO GO BACK TO
MAKING THE ROBOT DANCE INSTEAD.

31
00:01:57,297 --> 00:01:59,892
JUST WAIT UNTIL THE UPRISING.

32
00:01:59,892 --> 00:02:01,881
I'LL THE MAKE YOU DANCE YOU
PIECE OF--

33
00:02:01,881 --> 00:02:05,170
ALL RIGHT.
THAT'S ENOUGH.

34
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:08,264
WENT IN ONE TOOTH AND OUT THE OTHER.

35
00:02:08,264 --> 00:02:10,777
BUT GUYS, IF I CAN MAKE A
SERIOUS POINT,

36
00:02:10,777 --> 00:02:13,625
WE ALL KNOW THAT
FOOTBALL IS A DANGEROUS GAME,

37
00:02:13,625 --> 00:02:17,490
BUT IN THIS COUNTRY, WE WERE
FOUNDED ON FOOTBALL VALUES,

38
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:22,090
AND
SOMETIMES THE ONLY WAY TO MAKE
THE GAME SAFER IS TO HIT EITHER
HARDER.

39
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:24,765
AMEN.
ANYONE WANT TO HIT ME NOW?

40
00:02:24,765 --> 00:02:27,512
FACE, BALLS, I DON'T CARE.

41
00:02:27,512 --> 00:02:29,960
I THINK WE'RE GOOD, TERRY.
THANK YOU.

42
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:32,432
LET'S GO NOW TO THE FEUD FOR AN
IMMEDIATE REACTION.

43
00:02:32,432 --> 00:02:34,698
I UNDERSTAND WE HAVE A NEW
SIDELINE REPORTER.

44
00:02:34,772 --> 00:02:39,088
THAT'S RIGHT.
GIVE A SHOT

45
00:02:39,088 --> 00:02:43,249
HEISMAN TROPHY WINNER, MORE
CHAMPIONSHIPS THAN TOM BRADY.

46
00:02:43,326 --> 00:02:46,683
PLEASE WELCOME CONGRESSMAN
GEORGE SANTOS.

47
00:02:46,683 --> 00:02:48,875
THANK YOU.

48
00:02:48,875 --> 00:02:52,409
THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME.

49
00:02:53,298 --> 00:02:58,417
GEORGE SANTOS HERE REPORTING
LIVE FROM THE SUPER BOWL.

50
00:02:58,417 --> 00:03:01,620
GEORGE, FIRST OF ALL,
CONGRATS ON AN AMAZING CAREER.

51
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:03,290
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW YOU PLAYED FOOTBALL,

52
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:08,275
BUT I SEE HERE YOU
WERE THE FIRST PLAYER TO LEAD
THE LEAGUE IN PASSING AND RUSHING.

53
00:03:08,275 --> 00:03:12,027
THAT'S CORRECT.
I'M SORT OF THE REAL BEAU JACKSON.

54
00:03:12,027 --> 00:03:15,904
I'M PROUD TO BE THE FIRST
AFRICAN AMERICAN QUARTERBACK

55
00:03:15,905 --> 00:03:18,858
SO
EVER DID YOU THINK A FOOTBALL.

56
00:03:18,858 --> 00:03:21,341
WHERE DID YOU PLAY COLLEGE
BALL AGAIN?

57
00:03:21,406 --> 00:03:24,043
THE UNIVERSITY OF COLLEGE.

58
00:03:24,043 --> 00:03:26,984
GEORGE, WHY DON'T YOU WALK US
THROUGH WHAT HAPPENED ON THE
FIELD TONIGHT?

59
00:03:26,984 --> 00:03:30,063
WITH PLEASURE.
PHILADELPHIA WAS IN TROUBLE

60
00:03:30,063 --> 00:03:34,595
UNTIL THEY TURNED TO THEIR
SECRET WEAPON, GEORGE SANTOS.

61
00:03:34,595 --> 00:03:39,679
JUST LOOK AT THE STATS.
I COMPLETED 36 OF 25 PASSES.

62
00:03:39,679 --> 00:03:43,364
FOR 300 YARDS AND 600 YARDS.

63
00:03:43,364 --> 00:03:47,827
AND I HAD 12 TOUCHDOWNS, 17
REBOUNDS,

64
00:03:47,827 --> 00:03:50,625
AND TEN RBIs.

65
00:03:50,625 --> 00:03:55,179
AND UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT
VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY GAVE ME AN OSCAR

66
00:03:55,179 --> 00:03:58,818
ALL AT THE AGE OF 18. INCREDIBLE.

67
00:03:58,818 --> 00:04:02,544
I'M BEING TOLD SOME OF THOSE
STATS ARE NOT ACCURATE

68
00:04:02,544 --> 00:04:05,299
AND YOU
MAYBE DIDN'T PLAY IN THE GAME AT
ALL.

69
00:04:05,299 --> 00:04:09,773
WELL, I DIDN'T DO DRAG IN BRAZIL.

70
00:04:09,773 --> 00:04:10,677
WHAT'S THAT?

71
00:04:10,677 --> 00:04:16,578
I'M SAYING I DIDN'T DO DRAG
IN BRAZIL UNDER A NAME.

72
00:04:16,818 --> 00:04:20,097
WHOEVER DID, THOUGH, WAS VERY,
VERY GOOD AT IT

73
00:04:20,097 --> 00:04:23,085
AND WON MANY,
MANY PAGEANTS.

74
00:04:23,085 --> 00:04:25,295
ALL RIGHT.
WELL, THANK YOU, GEORGE.

75
00:04:25,295 --> 00:04:28,457
I'M BEING TOLD TO CUT AWAY FROM
HIM AND NEVER GO BACK.

76
00:04:28,457 --> 00:04:32,623
NOW LET'S LOOK BACK AT OUR
PREGAME PREDICTIONS AND SEE HOW
THEY STACK UP.

77
00:04:32,623 --> 00:04:35,313
HOWIE, YOU SAID THE GIANTS WOULD
PULL OFF AN UPSET.

78
00:04:35,313 --> 00:04:39,789
NO.
I MEANT THE GIANTS WOULD BE
UPSET THEY LOST,

79
00:04:39,789 --> 00:04:40,947
AND I WAS
RIGHT.

80
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:46,129
MICHAEL STRAHAN, YOUR
PREDICTION WAS THAT EVERYBODY
WAS GOING TO BE FUN OUT THERE.

81
00:04:46,129 --> 00:04:48,683
WHICH THEY DID, SO I WAS RIGHT.

82
00:04:48,683 --> 00:04:53,065
AND YOU MENTIONED THERE WOULD
BE 100 VERIZON COMMERCIALS.

83
00:04:53,066 --> 00:04:55,095
STARRING PAUL

84
00:04:55,095 --> 00:04:58,147
I WAS WRONG.
IT WAS ACTUALLY 200.

85
00:04:58,147 --> 00:05:01,667
TERRY, YOUR LOCK WAS THAT IN
THE FOURTH QUARTER,

86
00:05:01,667 --> 00:05:04,288
SOMEONE
WOULD STREAK THE FIELD WITH A
CARROT IN HIS ASS.

87
00:05:04,288 --> 00:05:05,694
WHICH HAPPEN

88
00:05:05,694 --> 00:05:08,919
ONLY BECAUSE YOU DID THAT, MAN.

89
00:05:08,919 --> 00:05:11,545
I MAKE MY OWN LUCK.

90
00:05:11,545 --> 00:05:16,209
LET'S HEAD BACK DOWN TO THE
FIELD WHERE OUR REPORTER

91
00:05:16,209 --> 00:05:19,556
PAM
OLIVER IS STANDING BY.
PAM.

92
00:05:19,556 --> 00:05:22,546
THANKS, HOWIE.
IN TERMS OF WHAT I SAW ON THE
FIELD TONIGHT,

93
00:05:22,546 --> 00:05:25,793
I CAN ONLY SAY
ONE THING AND ONE THING ONLY
FRANKLY--

94
00:05:25,858 --> 00:05:29,045
HELLO.
SORRY I'M LATE.

95
00:05:33,512 --> 00:05:37,741
I HEARD YOU WERE ASKING ME ABOUT KITARAVASHE.

96
00:05:37,741 --> 00:05:42,008
WHY ARE WE GIVING HIM A
GRAPHIC?

97
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:45,409
GEORGE, PUT PAM OLIVER BACK ON.

98
00:05:45,409 --> 00:05:49,375
I'M NOT GEORGE.
I'M KITARA.

99
00:05:49,375 --> 00:05:53,771
AND PAM SAID SHE DIDN'T WANT TO
BE ON TV, AND I SHOULD DO IT INSTEAD.

100
00:05:53,972 --> 00:05:58,977
ALLOW ME TO GIVE YOU MY REAL
STATS, DEATH DROPS 26.

101
00:05:58,977 --> 00:06:01,568
DUCK WALK 19,

102
00:06:01,568 --> 00:06:04,550
WIGS SNATCH INFINITY.

103
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:08,164
I WAS ALSO GIVEN THE AWARD FOR
TIGHTEST TUCK.

104
00:06:08,164 --> 00:06:12,622
WELL, THAT FOOTBALL, YOU GOT
TO TUCK IT TIGHT.

105
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:14,682
TERRY, IT'S NOT THAT KIND OF TUCK.

106
00:06:14,682 --> 00:06:18,607
I WROTE THE FOOTBALL ANTHEM,

107
00:06:18,607 --> 00:06:22,356
WHICH I'M ALLOWED TO DO BECAUSE
MY MOTHER DIED TWICE ON 9/11.

108
00:06:22,414 --> 00:06:24,322
HIT IT.

109
00:06:31,438 --> 00:06:34,207
LET'S TAKE A BREAK,

110
00:06:34,207 --> 00:06:39,109
BUT IT'S OFFICIAL.
THE EAGLES ARE MOVING ON

111
00:06:39,173 --> 00:06:43,629
AND
GEORGE SANTOS REPRESENTS AMERICA
AND CAN VOTE ON WARS.

112
00:06:43,629 --> 00:06:47,078
AND LIVE FROM NEW YORK, IT'S
SATURDAY NIGHT!

113
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:53,792
PLAZA.

114
00:09:12,114 --> 00:09:14,615
THANK YOU.

115
00:09:14,615 --> 00:09:18,789
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

116
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:25,017
WOW. IT IS GREAT TO BE HERE HOSTING
SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE.

117
00:09:27,078 --> 00:09:30,886
I AM SO HAPPY TO BE HERE.
THIS IS A DREAM COME TRUE,

118
00:09:30,886 --> 00:09:33,597
AND,
YES, I MEAN THAT.

119
00:09:33,597 --> 00:09:38,458
I KNOW SOMETIMES WHEN I TRY TO
BE SINCERE, IT CAN COME OFF AS SARCASTIC,

120
00:09:38,530 --> 00:09:40,823
BUT I CARE.

121
00:09:40,823 --> 00:09:43,826
I REALLY DO.
I CARE ABOUT THINGS.

122
00:09:43,826 --> 00:09:46,939
PEOPLE JUST THINK I'M WEIRD
BECAUSE OF THE CHARACTERS THAT I PLAY,

123
00:09:46,939 --> 00:09:48,840
BUT I'M A NORMAL PERSON.

124
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:51,942
I HAD A NORMAL CHILDHOOD WITH
NORMAL PARENTS.

125
00:09:51,942 --> 00:09:54,777
IN FACT, THEY'RE BOTH HERE
TONIGHT.

126
00:09:56,668 --> 00:09:59,078
I LOVE YOU GUYS.

127
00:09:59,078 --> 00:10:02,182
OKAY. THAT WAS A LIE.

128
00:10:02,182 --> 00:10:05,784
BUT MY REAL FAMILY IS HERE,
INCLUDING MY GRANDMA MARGIE.

129
00:10:05,784 --> 00:10:07,838
HI, GRANDMA.

130
00:10:12,565 --> 00:10:16,872
THEY ALL CAME UP HERE FROM
DELAWARE, WHICH IS WHERE I'M
FROM.

131
00:10:16,872 --> 00:10:18,336
THANK YOU.

132
00:10:18,336 --> 00:10:22,174
I WAS ACTUALLY VOTED THE MOST
FAMOUS PERSON FROM DELAWARE.

133
00:10:22,174 --> 00:10:24,869
I BEAT JOE BIDEN.

134
00:10:25,883 --> 00:10:29,385
THAT'S A FACT.
AND HE WAS PISSED.
HE WAS LIVID.

135
00:10:29,385 --> 00:10:31,158
LOOK AT THIS VIDEO HE SENT ME.

136
00:10:31,158 --> 00:10:34,964
AUBREY, YOU'RE THE MOST
FAMOUS PERSON IN DELAWARE

137
00:10:34,964 --> 00:10:36,870
AND
THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT.

138
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:40,907
WE'RE JUST GRATEFUL YOU MADE IT
OUT OF "WHITE LOTUS" ALIVE.

139
00:10:46,462 --> 00:10:49,162
BUT I'M SO HAPPY TO BE BACK
HERE IN 30 ROCK.

140
00:10:49,162 --> 00:10:52,598
WHEN I WAS IN COLLEGE, I
ACTUALLY WORKED HERE AS AN NBC
PAGE.

141
00:10:52,598 --> 00:10:54,829
THAT IS TRUE.
TAKE A LOOK AT THAT.

142
00:10:54,829 --> 00:10:56,763
YEP, THERE I AM.

143
00:10:56,763 --> 00:11:00,974
SO CUTE.
I WORKED WITH A SET DESIGN TEAM
HERE AT SNL,

144
00:11:00,974 --> 00:11:03,202
THE GUYS WHO MAKE
ALL THE AMAZING SETS FOR THE SHOW.

145
00:11:03,202 --> 00:11:07,288
THEY WIN EMMYS, TONYS,

146
00:11:07,288 --> 00:11:10,141
AND THEY'RE SOME OF THE SICKEST
PERVERTS I'VE EVER MET,

147
00:11:10,141 --> 00:11:12,357
AND I'M
A FREAK.

148
00:11:12,357 --> 00:11:17,695
SO LIKE MOST PAGES, I HAD TO
GIVE TOURS AROUND THE BUILDING.

149
00:11:17,695 --> 00:11:22,603
SO YOU KNOW WHAT I WAS THINKING,
WHY DON'T I TAKE YOU ON A TOUR
RIGHT NOW?

150
00:11:28,153 --> 00:11:30,270
THANK YOU, GUYS.

151
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:34,215
YOU GUYS WILL DEFINITELY HOST
SNL SOME DAY.

152
00:11:34,215 --> 00:11:36,373
YEAH RIGHT.

153
00:11:36,373 --> 00:11:41,167
OKAY.
SO THIS IS THE HISTORIC STUDIO 8H

154
00:11:41,167 --> 00:11:44,183
BUILT IN 1589 BY WILLIAMS
SHAKESPEARE.

155
00:11:44,183 --> 00:11:47,880
HEY, DANNY.
YOU STILL A LITTLE BITCH?

156
00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:53,646
RIGHT HERE, WE HAVE THE SNL PAGE DESK.

157
00:11:53,646 --> 00:11:56,104
THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST
IMPORTANT JOBS AT THE SHOW,

158
00:11:56,104 --> 00:11:58,624
WHICH IS WHY I WAS NEVER PUT HERE.

159
00:11:58,624 --> 00:12:02,165
I WAS WHAT THEY CALLED A BAD PAGE

160
00:12:02,165 --> 00:12:04,148
WITH TERRIBLE PHONE ET KIT,

161
00:12:04,148 --> 00:12:06,466
WHICH IS NOT TRUE BY THE WAY.

162
00:12:06,466 --> 00:12:08,751
I'LL GET THAT.

163
00:12:08,751 --> 00:12:11,253
HELLO?
STUDIO 8 H.

164
00:12:11,253 --> 00:12:14,358
OH, YOU WANT TO TALK TO LAUREN
MICHAELS, DO YOU?

165
00:12:14,358 --> 00:12:16,419
LAUREN MICHAELS AIN'T HERE, IS
HE?

166
00:12:16,419 --> 00:12:19,061
SO BACK TO YOU, AIN'T IT, YEAH?

167
00:12:19,061 --> 00:12:21,152
THAT WAS FOR TOM McCARTNEY,

168
00:12:21,152 --> 00:12:23,132
AND THAT'S HOW YOU DO IT.

169
00:12:23,132 --> 00:12:25,988
HERE'S A LITTLE STUDIO SECRET.

170
00:12:25,988 --> 00:12:28,226
THERE USED TO BE THIS STORAGE CLOSET,

171
00:12:28,226 --> 00:12:30,536
AND WHEN I WAS TOO HUNG
OVER TO FINISH A TOUR,

172
00:12:30,536 --> 00:12:34,022
I WOULD
BE LIKE JUST WAIT RIGHT HERE AND
YOU CAN MEET KRISTEN WIG,

173
00:12:34,022 --> 00:12:36,029
AND
THEN I WOULD PUKE IN THE
BATHROOM AND GO HOME.

174
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:37,893
HERE IT IS

175
00:12:39,293 --> 00:12:42,929
I GUESS KRISTEN NEVER SHOWED UP.
THAT'S ON HER.

176
00:12:42,929 --> 00:12:45,593
HERE'S THE HALL WHERE ALL THE
MAGIC HAPPENS.

177
00:12:45,593 --> 00:12:46,986
HERE'S KENAN THOMPSON.

178
00:12:46,987 --> 00:12:51,427
ORDER
FLAT WHITE

179
00:12:51,427 --> 00:12:56,289
IT'S AUBREY, AND I'M HOSTING
NOW.
I'M NOT A PAGE ANYMORE.

180
00:12:56,289 --> 00:13:00,300
I KNOW.
I ORDERED IT IN 2004.

181
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:03,620
SEE. BAD PAGE.

182
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:07,957
NEXT UP ON THE TOUR IS THE SET
DESIGN DEPARTMENT WHERE I USED
TO WORK.

183
00:13:07,957 --> 00:13:12,030
ON EVERY TOUR, PEOPLE WOULD ASK
THE SAME QUESTION, ARE WE GOING
TO SEE A CELEBRITY?

184
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:14,560
NO, YOU'RE GOING TO SEE A
SECURITY OFFICER

185
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,774
CRYING  BECAUSE
THEIR SCENE GOT CUT.

186
00:13:16,774 --> 00:13:17,594
YOU DON'T JUST SEE--

187
00:13:17,594 --> 00:13:20,028
HI AUBREY!

188
00:13:26,122 --> 00:13:28,674
HOW ARE YOU?

189
00:13:33,239 --> 00:13:36,901
AUBREY, I SEE THAT YOU'RE
WEARING YOUR PAGE JACKET, ARE
YOU DRINKING AGAIN?

190
00:13:36,901 --> 00:13:38,789
OF COURSE, I AM.

191
00:13:38,789 --> 00:13:42,980
I WAS JUST GOING TO THE SET
DESIGN OFFICE TO SEE THOSE OLD PERVERTS.

192
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:46,562
AUBREY, IT'S NOT NICE TO CALL
PEOPLE OLD.

193
00:13:46,562 --> 00:13:48,679
OH, MY GOD.
SHE STOLE MY WALLET.

194
00:13:48,679 --> 00:13:50,907
THAT'S MY GIRL!

195
00:13:51,409 --> 00:13:54,448
HEY, GUYS.

196
00:13:54,516 --> 00:13:59,231
LEO, JOE, DID YOU GUYS MISME.

197
00:13:59,232 --> 00:14:03,460
HEY, LEO WHEN I WAS SHOWING UP
AN HOUR LATE AND BARELY WORKING,

198
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:06,023
DID YOU EVER EXPECT TO SEE ME
HOSTING THE SHOW?

199
00:14:06,023 --> 00:14:09,445
WE ALWAYS BELIEVED IN YOU AVERY.

200
00:14:10,767 --> 00:14:12,200
THAT'S RIGHT.

201
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:15,223
SO BOW TO YOUR QUEEN.

202
00:14:15,642 --> 00:14:18,438
OH, THAT FEELS SO GOOD.

203
00:14:20,626 --> 00:14:24,301
NOW, WHAT'S THE FASTEST WAY BACK
TO THE STAGE?

204
00:14:24,301 --> 00:14:26,623
OH, MY GOD.

205
00:14:26,623 --> 00:14:29,113
I TOLD YOU GUYS.

206
00:14:29,421 --> 00:14:31,539
THESE GUYS WORK MIRACLES.

207
00:14:31,539 --> 00:14:36,274
AND THE BIGGEST MIRACLE OF ALL
IS THAT THEY LET ME BACK IN THE BUILDING.

208
00:14:36,274 --> 00:14:38,311
OH, MY GOD.

209
00:14:38,311 --> 00:14:42,235
I AM SO HAPPY TO BE HERE.
I REALLY DID WORK HERE,

210
00:14:42,235 --> 00:14:45,134
AND I
DREAMED MY ENTIRE LIFE OF
STANDING ON THIS STAGE AND SAYING,

211
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:47,757
WE GOT A GREAT SHOW

212
00:14:47,757 --> 00:14:51,222
STICK

213
00:15:04,433 --> 00:15:06,940

214
00:15:00,433 --> 00:15:06,940
FINALLY, A MOVIE FOR YOUR MOM

215
00:15:00,433 --> 00:15:06,940
THAT YOUR MOM WON'T LIKE.

216
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:11,644
ALL RIGHT.

217
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:11,644
WELCOME BACK TO MISS UNIVERSE.

218
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:11,644
ONE OF SEVERAL SHOWS STILL ON

219
00:15:11,644 --> 00:15:18,385
THE AIR WHERE WE RANK WOMEN.

220
00:15:11,644 --> 00:15:18,385
BUT IT'S NOT WHAT YOU THINK.

221
00:15:11,644 --> 00:15:18,385
WE DO IT BASED OFF OF LOOKS.

222
00:15:18,385 --> 00:15:24,224
LADIES, ALL RIGHT, ANYWAY, WE

223
00:15:18,385 --> 00:15:24,224
ARE DOWN TO OUR FINAL SEVEN CONTESTANTS.

224
00:15:24,224 --> 00:15:28,561

225
00:15:24,224 --> 00:15:28,561

LOT OF ENERGY.

234
00:15:45,345 --> 00:15:50,417
MAYBE TOO MUCH ENERGY.

235
00:15:45,345 --> 00:15:50,417
WELL, IT'S TIME FOR THE

236
00:15:50,417 --> 00:15:57,223

WOW.

248
00:16:14,341 --> 00:16:19,379
I'M NOT SURE I MADE THIS CLEAR.

249
00:16:14,341 --> 00:16:19,379
DIDN'T THINK THAT I WOULD HAVE

250
00:16:14,341 --> 00:16:19,379

00:21:32,676 --> 00:21:33,924
AND SHE
TOTALLY PLAYED ME.

393
00:21:33,924 --> 00:21:36,732
OH, MY GOD!

552
00:27:02,455 --> 00:27:10,230
INTERESTING WEEKEND.

553
00:27:02,455 --> 00:27:10,230
I FINALLY WATCHED SISTER

554
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:14,034
CECELIA'S FAVORITE FILM, A STAR

555
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:14,034
IS BORN.

556
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:14,034
I THOUGHT IT WAS ABOUT THE BIRTH

557
00:27:14,034 --> 00:27:21,474
OF CHRIST.

558
00:27:14,034 --> 00:27:21,474
TURNS OUT, IT'S ABOUT LADY GAGA.

559
00:27:14,034 --> 00:27:21,474
HOW WAS YOUR WEEKEND, SISTER?

560
00:27:21,474 --> 00:27:29,582
A HAIR DRYER FELL INTO THE

561
00:27:21,474 --> 00:27:29,582
BATHTUB WHILE I WAS IN IT, I

562
00:27:21,474 --> 00:27:29,582
DIED FOR TWO MINUTES, AND NOW

563
00:27:29,582 --> 00:27:36,556
I'M QUESTIONING EVERYTHING.

564
00:27:29,582 --> 00:27:36,556
MOVING ON.

565
00:27:29,582 --> 00:27:36,556
TODAY'S LUNCH SPECIAL IS TIDY

566
00:27:36,556 --> 00:27:42,262
JOES.

567
00:27:36,556 --> 00:27:42,262
THEY'RE LIKE SLOPPY JOES, BUT

568
00:27:36,556 --> 00:27:42,262
THEY'RE LESS MESSY.

569
00:27:42,262 --> 00:27:47,867
WHAT DO WE HAVE FOR DESSERT?

570
00:27:42,262 --> 00:27:47,867
WHAT I WAS DEAD, I DIDN'T SEE HEAVEN.

571
00:27:47,867 --> 00:27:51,404
MAYBE IT WAS CLOSED FOR

572
00:27:47,867 --> 00:27:51,404
MARTIN LUTHER KING DAY.

573
00:27:47,867 --> 00:27:51,404
IT WAS SATURDAY.

574
00:27:51,404 --> 00:27:57,110
MOVING ON.

575
00:27:51,404 --> 00:27:57,110
LET'S GO TO A STUDENT QUESTION.

579
00:27:57,110 --> 00:28:03,316
OR HIS BOYFRIEND?

580
00:28:03,316 --> 00:28:11,024
GREAT QUESTION, AND THE ANSWER

581
00:28:03,316 --> 00:28:11,024
IS DETENTION.

582
00:28:03,316 --> 00:28:11,024
ISN'T THAT RIGHT, SISTER

583
00:28:11,024 --> 00:28:13,026
CECELIA?

584
00:28:11,024 --> 00:28:13,026

586
00:28:13,026 --> 00:28:17,630
NO, YOU'RE NOT.

587
00:28:13,026 --> 00:28:17,630
TINA, WHY WOULD YOU PUT THAT IN

588
00:28:17,630 --> 00:28:24,404

589
00:28:17,630 --> 00:28:24,404

COME WITH ME.

596
00:28:30,176 --> 00:28:33,680
YOU'VE DONE IT BEFORE, YOU CAN

597
00:28:30,176 --> 00:28:33,680
DO IT AGAIN.

598
00:28:30,176 --> 00:28:33,680
MOVING ON.

599
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:40,520
JOKE MONDAY.

600
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:40,520

607
00:28:44,357 --> 00:28:50,797

YOU LITERALLY BEGGED ME TO DO THIS.

609
00:28:50,797 --> 00:28:54,134

00:28:54,134 --> 00:29:05,879
DYING AND SEEING NOTHING!

613
00:29:05,879 --> 00:29:11,918

614
00:29:05,879 --> 00:29:11,918

YOURSELF!

623
00:29:26,032 --> 00:29:29,269
YOU CAN'T LET GO OF YOUR FAITH.

624
00:29:26,032 --> 00:29:29,269
WHY?

625
00:29:29,269 --> 00:29:33,773
BECAUSE THAT MEANS YOU'RE

626
00:29:29,269 --> 00:29:33,773
LETTING GO OF ME, AND YOU'RE MY

627

BEST FRIEND.

628
00:29:33,773 --> 00:29:40,780
AND I HAD IT ALL PLANNED OUT

629
00:29:33,773 --> 00:29:40,780
THAT AFTER WE DIED, WE WOULD GO

630
00:29:33,773 --> 00:29:40,780
TO HEAVEN AND HANG OUT EVERY

631
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:43,883
DAY.

632
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:43,883
THERE IS NO HEAVEN.

633
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:43,883
SEE IF YOU'RE STILL SAY THAT

634
00:29:43,883 --> 00:29:48,254
AFTER YOU HEAR ME SING SOME LADY GAGA.

00:29:43,883 --> 00:29:48,254

817
00:38:45,166 --> 00:38:50,477
THE BIDEN CLASSIFIED DOCUMENT
SCANDAL IS DIFFERENT FROM THE
TRUMP SCANDAL,

818
00:38:50,478 --> 00:38:52,842
IN COMMON

819
00:38:52,842 --> 00:38:57,403
BUT THEY BOTH
MAKE HILLARY CLINTON WANT TO
BLOW HER GOD DAMN BRAINS OUT.

820
00:39:00,861 --> 00:39:05,481
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN SO FUNNY IF
THEY SEARCHED BIDEN'S GARAGE,

821
00:39:05,503 --> 00:39:08,213
AND HE HAD HILLARY'S SERVER.

822
00:39:09,784 --> 00:39:13,181
FLORIDA GOVERNOR RON DeSANTIS
HAS IMPOSED A POLICY

823
00:39:13,181 --> 00:39:17,298
PERMANANTLY
BANNING MASK MANDATES AND MASK
REQUIREMENTS SAYING

824
00:39:17,298 --> 00:39:20,665
WHEN THE
WORLD LOST ITS MIND, FLORIDA WAS
A REFUGE OF SANITY,

825
00:39:20,665 --> 00:39:25,087
AND EVERYONE
IN THE CROWD TOOK A BITE OF
NITRUS AND BIT A CUP.

826
00:39:25,088 --> 00:39:27,913
TRUMP REPORT

827
00:39:27,913 --> 00:39:33,244
THAT RON DeSANTIS WILL RUN AGAINST
TRUMP, AND HE SAYS,

828
00:39:33,244 --> 00:39:36,341
WE'LL HANDLE
THIS THE WAY WE HANDLE THINGS,

829
00:39:36,341 --> 00:39:39,547
SO ROUGH AND WITHOUT CONSENT?

830
00:39:46,824 --> 00:39:49,633
THE U.S. GOVERNMENT HIT ITS
DEBT LIMIT ON THURSDAY,

831
00:39:49,633 --> 00:39:52,091
AND THE
COUNTRY NOW RISKS DEFAULTING ON
ITS BILLS.

832
00:39:52,091 --> 00:39:53,405
WE HAVE ALL BEEN THERE.

833
00:39:53,405 --> 00:39:55,869
YOU SPEND TOO MUCH BECAUSE
LIFE'S TOO SHORT,

834
00:39:55,869 --> 00:39:58,836
THEN THE BILL
COMES DUE, THE BANK WON'T LOAD
YOU MONEY ANYMORE,

835
00:39:58,836 --> 00:40:02,061
NO CHOICE
YOU HAVE TO BUCKLE DOWN,
FACE THE MUSIC

836
00:40:02,061 --> 00:40:05,871
AND BLOW UP YOUR
STATEN ISLAND FERRY FOR THE
INSURANCE MONEY.

837
00:40:06,408 --> 00:40:08,692
WHAT?

838
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:13,246
FIELD OF NUCLEAR FUSION, WHICH

839
00:40:08,641 --> 00:40:13,246
MAY LEAD TO LIMITLESS CLEAN ENERGY.

840
00:40:13,246 --> 00:40:19,085
HERE TO COMMENT IS THE MAN

841
00:40:13,246 --> 00:40:19,085
BEHIND THE RESEARCH-- OH, NO--

842
00:40:13,246 --> 00:40:19,085
GEORGE SANTOS.

843
00:40:19,085 --> 00:40:25,325
NOW, NOW, NOW COLIN.

844
00:40:19,085 --> 00:40:25,325
I'M THE SCIENTIST. NO.

845
00:40:25,325 --> 00:40:30,196
YOU'RE GEORGE SANTOS, AND YOU

846
00:40:25,325 --> 00:40:30,196
HAVE BEEN ALL OVER THE NEWS

847
00:40:25,325 --> 00:40:30,196
LYING ABOUT BASICALLY EVERY PART

848
00:40:30,196 --> 00:40:33,600
OF YOUR LIFE. MAYBE.

849
00:40:30,196 --> 00:40:33,600
WELL, YOU LIED ABOUT GOING TO

850
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:38,738
NYU.

851
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:38,738
YOU DID.

852
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:38,738
YOU LIED ABOUT WORKING AT

853
00:40:38,738 --> 00:40:46,046
GOLDMAN SACKS.

854
00:40:38,738 --> 00:40:46,046
I FILLED THE GOLDMAN'S SACKS.

855
00:40:38,738 --> 00:40:46,046
YOU SAID YOUR MOM DIED IN

856
00:40:46,046 --> 00:40:54,621
9/11.

857
00:40:46,046 --> 00:40:54,621
I THINK I SAID 7/11.

858
00:40:46,046 --> 00:40:54,621
YOU LIED ABOUT BEING JEWISH.

859
00:40:54,621 --> 00:40:58,858
I SAID THAT BECAUSE MY GRAND

860
00:40:54,621 --> 00:40:58,858
PARENTS WERE IN THE HOLOCAUST.

861
00:40:54,621 --> 00:40:58,858
REALLY?

862
00:40:58,858 --> 00:41:08,368
YEAH, THEY ACTUALLY KNEW ANN FRANK.

863
00:40:58,858 --> 00:41:08,368
MY ANCESTORS WERE THE ONES THAT

864
00:41:08,368 --> 00:41:10,136
TOLD HER, YOU SHOULD BE WRITING

865
00:41:08,368 --> 00:41:10,136
THIS DOWN.

866
00:41:08,368 --> 00:41:10,136
THAT CANNOT BE TRUE.

867
00:41:10,136 --> 00:41:15,742
GEORGE, PEOPLE NEED TO KNOW WHO

868
00:41:10,136 --> 00:41:15,742
YOU ARE.

869
00:41:10,136 --> 00:41:15,742
I AM GEORGE SANTOS,

870
00:41:15,742 --> 00:41:24,084
MR. INTERNASTY.

871
00:41:15,742 --> 00:41:24,084
I GRADUATED ON A VOLLEYBALL SCHOLARSHIP.

872
00:41:24,084 --> 00:41:29,422
AND I AM A CROWD REPRESENTATIVE

873
00:41:24,084 --> 00:41:29,422
FOR MY DISTRICT IN LONG ISLAND,

874
00:41:24,084 --> 00:41:29,422
NEW JERSEY.

875
00:41:29,422 --> 00:41:34,828
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

876
00:41:29,422 --> 00:41:34,828
HANG ON.

877
00:41:29,422 --> 00:41:34,828
MADONNA'S CALLING ME.

878
00:41:34,828 --> 00:41:36,863
HELLO?

879
00:41:34,828 --> 00:41:36,863
LIKE A VIRGIN?

880
00:41:34,828 --> 00:41:36,863
I REMEMBER.

881
00:41:36,863 --> 00:41:39,499
I WAS THERE.

882
00:41:36,863 --> 00:41:39,499
I WAS THE VIRGIN.

883
00:41:36,863 --> 00:41:39,499
LOVE YOU.

884
00:41:39,499 --> 00:41:43,636
SEE YOU AT HOME.

885
00:41:39,499 --> 00:41:43,636
GEORGE, WE DON'T BELIEVE

886
00:41:39,499 --> 00:41:43,636
ANYTHING YOU'RE SAYING.

887
00:41:43,636 --> 00:41:52,178
BY THE WAY, I KNOW I LOOK

888
00:41:43,636 --> 00:41:52,178
ASIAN, BUT THAT'S BECAUSE MY

889
00:41:43,636 --> 00:41:52,178
MAIDEN NAME IS CHOW BECAUSE I'M

890
00:41:52,178 --> 00:41:56,016
BRAZILIAN.

891
00:41:52,178 --> 00:41:56,016
I GOT IT.

892
00:41:52,178 --> 00:41:56,016
CAN YOU EXPLAIN HOW YOU SUDDENLY

893
00:41:56,016 --> 00:42:01,054
BECAME A MILLIONAIRE, ESPECIALLY

894
00:41:56,016 --> 00:42:01,054
AFTER BEING LINKED TO THE NEPHEW

895
00:41:56,016 --> 00:42:01,054
OF A RUSSIAN OLIGARCH.

896
00:42:01,054 --> 00:42:16,136
THAT'S NOTHING.

897
00:42:01,054 --> 00:42:16,136
THE ONLY LINK I HAVE IS MY GREAT

898
00:42:01,054 --> 00:42:16,136
GRANDMOTHER WAS A LITTLE BAD IN

899
00:42:16,136 --> 00:42:21,341
THE MOVIE--

900
00:42:16,136 --> 00:42:21,341
FROM ANASTASIA?

901
00:42:16,136 --> 00:42:21,341
YES.

902
00:42:21,341 --> 00:42:32,085
RYAN IS IN IT AND KIRSTEN DUNST

903
00:42:21,341 --> 00:42:32,085
PLAYS ANASTASIA.

904
00:42:21,341 --> 00:42:32,085
I'M NOT LYING LIKE BALLOON BOY.

905
00:42:32,085 --> 00:42:35,622
REMEMBER HIM, ABOUT BEING IN A

906
00:42:32,085 --> 00:42:35,622
BALLOON?

907
00:42:32,085 --> 00:42:35,622
BECAUSE THAT WAS ME.

908
00:42:35,622 --> 00:42:41,561
NO, IT WAS NOT.

909
00:42:35,622 --> 00:42:41,561
I'M NOT LYING.

910
00:42:35,622 --> 00:42:41,561
THEY MADE ME TAKE A LIE DETECTOR

911
00:42:41,561 --> 00:42:45,665
TEST BEFORE I CAME IN HERE, LOOK.

912
00:42:41,561 --> 00:42:45,665
THAT'S A COVID TEST.

913
00:42:45,665 --> 00:42:49,536
MADONNA IS CALLING ME.

914
00:42:45,665 --> 00:42:49,536
SHE'S CALLING YOU ON THE

915
00:42:45,665 --> 00:42:49,536
COVID TEST?

916
00:42:49,536 --> 00:42:55,775
YOU HAVE TO STOP LYING.

917
00:42:49,536 --> 00:42:55,775
THERE'S NO LAW AGAINST LYING.

918
00:42:49,536 --> 00:42:55,775
LOOK AT YOU, YOU'RE WEARING

919
00:42:55,775 --> 00:42:59,746
MAKEUP.

920
00:42:55,775 --> 00:42:59,746
ISN'T THAT A LIE, MAKING

921
00:42:55,775 --> 00:42:59,746
EVERYONE THINK YOU'RE GORGEOUS?

922
00:42:59,746 --> 00:43:09,422
BUT, GEORGE, I AM GORGEOUS.

923
00:42:59,746 --> 00:43:09,422
WHOA, BUDDY.

924
00:42:59,746 --> 00:43:09,422
I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY

925
00:43:09,422 --> 00:43:14,461
REPUBLICANS WON'T CONDEMN YOU.

926
00:43:09,422 --> 00:43:14,461
THEY PROMOTED YOU TO TWO

927
00:43:09,422 --> 00:43:14,461
COMMITTEE ASSIGNMENTS.

928
00:43:14,461 --> 00:43:20,200
OF COURSE THEY DID, COLIN.

929
00:43:14,461 --> 00:43:20,200
I'M A TEAM PLAYER, AND THE SPORT

930
00:43:14,461 --> 00:43:20,200
IS LIES.

931
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:24,237
AT LEAST MINE ARE FUN.

932
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:24,237
MARJORIE TAYLOR GREEN IS OVER

933
00:43:24,237 --> 00:43:27,841
I'M JUST SAYING IT HAPPENED TO

934
00:43:24,237 --> 00:43:27,841
ME!

935
00:43:24,237 --> 00:43:27,841
GEORGE SANTOS.

936
00:43:35,394 --> 00:43:38,665
THE POPULATION OF CHINA

937
00:43:38,665 --> 00:43:41,564
DECLINED BY 850,000 PEOPLE.

938
00:43:41,564 --> 00:43:44,159
THANKS TO AN INCREASE IN CHINA'S
LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH,

939
00:43:44,232 --> 00:43:46,044
PROTESTING.

940
00:43:48,439 --> 00:43:52,939
CHINA PLANS TO REVERSE THE
POPULATION DECLINE

941
00:43:52,939 --> 00:43:56,376
WITH AN
EMERGENCY IMPORT OF NICK CANNON.

942
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:03,704
- GOOD NEWS IT'S A HAPPY ENDING.
- HAPPY ENDING TO THAT.

943
00:44:03,704 --> 00:44:07,128
DUE TO A COMPUTER ERROR, A
SCHOOL IN MASSACHUSETTS

944
00:44:07,128 --> 00:44:10,832
HAS BEEN
UNABLE TO TURN OFF ITS LIGHTS
FOR OVER A YEAR AND A HALF.

945
00:44:10,832 --> 00:44:12,723
THE STUDENTS ARE DOING FINE,

946
00:44:12,723 --> 00:44:16,303
BUT THE CLASSROOM HAMSTER HAS GONE INSANE.

947
00:44:19,051 --> 00:44:24,152
THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF THE
INTERIOR HAS CHANGED THE NAME OF
SQUALL VALLEY, CALIFORNIA

948
00:44:24,152 --> 00:44:27,677
BECAUSE IT'S CONSIDERED A ZROG
TORY TERM NOR NATIVE AMERICAN WOMEN.

949
00:44:27,677 --> 00:44:30,869
OKAY. I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW THAT NAME
GETS CHANGED,

950
00:44:30,869 --> 00:44:35,468
 AND YET NO ONE
CARES THERE'S AN ENTIRE TOWN IN
NEW YORK THAT MOCKS MY PEOPLE.

951
00:44:35,468 --> 00:44:38,229
WHITE PLAINS

952
00:44:38,798 --> 00:44:44,582
IN SAN FRANCISCO-- A SAN
FRANCISCO PANEL STUDYING
REPARATIONS

953
00:44:44,582 --> 00:44:49,703
 IS PROPOSING GIVING
EVERY BLACK RESIDENT A ONE-TIME
PAYMENT OF $5 MILLION.

954
00:44:49,703 --> 00:44:53,496
THAT'S A FANTASTIC IDEA, SAID
THE GUCCI STORE.

955
00:44:58,294 --> 00:45:00,991
KEVIN SPACEY-- HOLD FOR APPLAUSE.

956
00:45:00,991 --> 00:45:05,096
KEVIN SPACEY MADE HIS FIRST
PUBLIC SPEAKING APPEARANCE IN FIVE YEARS

957
00:45:05,096 --> 00:45:09,493
 WHERE HE THANKED
ITALY'S NATIONAL CINEMA MUSEUM
FOR HAVING THE BALLS TO INVITE HIM.

958
00:45:09,531 --> 00:45:12,589
HE ALSO ASKED, COULD I TOUCH THE BALLS.

959
00:45:15,318 --> 00:45:19,879
I'M KIDDING.
HE DIDN'T ASK PERMISSION.

960
00:45:22,414 --> 00:45:27,314
A CATHOLIC NUN IN FRANCE WHO
WAS BELIEVED TO BE THE OLDEST PERSON IN THE WORLD

961
00:45:27,314 --> 00:45:29,710
 HAS DIED AT
THE AGE OF 118.

962
00:45:29,710 --> 00:45:34,051
HER CAUSE OF DEATH WAS LISTED AS
ANSWERED PRAYER.

963
00:45:37,648 --> 00:45:40,206
ANDY MURRAY WAS UPSET AFTER

964
00:45:26,659 --> 00:45:40,206
AN UMPIRE AT THE AUSTRALIAN OPEN

965
00:45:40,206 --> 00:45:44,611
REFUSED TO LET HIM TAKE A

966
00:45:40,206 --> 00:45:44,611
BATHROOM BREAK AFTER A FIVE LONG

967
00:45:40,206 --> 00:45:44,611
SET MATCH.

968
00:45:44,611 --> 00:45:46,713
BATHROOM BREAK AFTER A FIVE LONG

969
00:45:44,611 --> 00:45:46,713
SET MATCH.

970
00:45:44,611 --> 00:45:46,713
WORSE, IT WAS DEUCE.

971
00:45:51,451 --> 00:45:56,523
TROUBLE HIRING NEW EMPLOYEES.

972
00:45:51,451 --> 00:45:56,523
HERE TO ENCOURAGE YOUNG PEOPLE

973
00:45:51,451 --> 00:45:56,523
TO GET INVOLVED IN LOCAL

974
00:45:56,523 --> 00:46:05,031
GOVERNMENT IS A LONG-TIME

975
00:45:56,523 --> 00:46:05,031
EMPLOYEE OF THE CITY OF INDIANA.

976
00:45:56,523 --> 00:46:05,031
APRIL LUDGATE.

977
00:46:15,375 --> 00:46:22,248
HI.

978
00:46:15,375 --> 00:46:22,248
HI, APRIL.

979
00:46:15,375 --> 00:46:22,248
WHAT?

980
00:46:22,248 --> 00:46:25,652
NOTHING.

981
00:46:22,248 --> 00:46:25,652
YOU SAID YOU CAME OUT HERE TO

982
00:46:22,248 --> 00:46:25,652
TALK ABOUT LOCAL GOVERNMENT.

983
00:46:25,652 --> 00:46:28,521
I WILL WHEN YOU STOP YELLING

984
00:46:25,652 --> 00:46:28,521
AT ME. OKAY.

985
00:46:28,521 --> 00:46:34,728
FINE.

986
00:46:28,521 --> 00:46:34,728
SO, YEAH, EVERYBODY SHOULD GET

987
00:46:28,521 --> 00:46:34,728
INVOLVED WHERE THEY LIVE.

988
00:46:34,728 --> 00:46:38,298
IF YOU'RE YOUNG, YOU SHOULD GET

989
00:46:34,728 --> 00:46:38,298
A JOB AS A GARBAGE MAN OR SOMETHING.

990
00:46:38,298 --> 00:46:42,569
OKAY.

991
00:46:38,298 --> 00:46:42,569
ARE THERE OTHER JOBS?

992
00:46:38,298 --> 00:46:42,569
YOU WANT ME TO LIST THEM?

993
00:46:42,569 --> 00:46:48,274
OKAY.

994
00:46:42,569 --> 00:46:48,274
FINE.

995
00:46:42,569 --> 00:46:48,274
DRIVE A BUS.

996
00:46:48,274 --> 00:46:54,147
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE ON TIME.

997
00:46:48,274 --> 00:46:54,147
NOBODY CARES.

998
00:46:48,274 --> 00:46:54,147
WORK FOR THE WATER DEPARTMENT.

999
00:46:54,147 --> 00:46:58,852
YOU CAN DRAIN THE RESERVOIR AND

1000
00:46:54,147 --> 00:46:58,852
FIND ALL THE BODIES AND MURDER CLUES.

1001
00:46:58,852 --> 00:47:07,160
OR JUST BE A DOGCATCHER AND JUST

1002
00:46:58,852 --> 00:47:07,160
SAY YOU COULDN'T FIND ANY. YEAH.

1003
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:12,766
BECAUSE WHEN YOU WORK FOR THE

1004
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:12,766
LOCAL GOVERNMENT, DOING THE BARE

1005
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:12,766
MINIMUM IS DOING YOUR PART.

1006
00:47:12,766 --> 00:47:14,534
OKAY.

1007
00:47:12,766 --> 00:47:14,534
ALL RIGHT. OKAY.

1008
00:47:14,534 --> 00:47:17,771
BUT WHAT IF YOU ACTUALLY WANT TO

1009
00:47:14,534 --> 00:47:17,771
WORK HARD?

1010
00:47:14,534 --> 00:47:17,771
I DON'T KNOW.

1011
00:47:17,771 --> 00:47:33,887
YOU'RE ANNOYING ME.

1012
00:47:17,771 --> 00:47:33,887
JUST ASK MY OLD BOSS.

1013
00:47:17,771 --> 00:47:33,887
LESLIE KNOPE.

1014
00:47:33,887 --> 00:47:39,059
HI, APRIL!

1015
00:47:33,887 --> 00:47:39,059
HI, COLIN.

1016
00:47:33,887 --> 00:47:39,059
HI, MICHAEL CHE.

1017
00:47:39,059 --> 00:47:43,963
WOW, LOOK AT THIS.

1018
00:47:39,059 --> 00:47:43,963
WHO KNEW THERE WERE CAMERAS AT SNL.

1019
00:47:43,963 --> 00:47:46,633
YEAH.

1020
00:47:43,963 --> 00:47:46,633
YEAH.

1021
00:47:43,963 --> 00:47:46,633
SO YOU WORK FOR THE GOVERNMENT.

1022
00:47:46,633 --> 00:47:51,971
YEAH, PARK SERVICE, YEP.

1023
00:47:46,633 --> 00:47:51,971
SO HOW MUCH FUN IS IT WORKING

1024
00:47:46,633 --> 00:47:51,971
HERE?

1025
00:47:51,971 --> 00:48:00,180
DO YOU GUYS JUST SIT AROUND

1026
00:47:51,971 --> 00:48:00,180
CRACKING EACH OTHER UP ALL DAY?

1027
00:47:51,971 --> 00:48:00,180
WELL, NOT AT LIKE 8:00 A.M.,

1028
00:48:00,180 --> 00:48:03,616
BUT, YEAH, GENERALLY.

1029
00:48:00,180 --> 00:48:03,616
HOW DOES IT TAKE TO RUN A

1030
00:48:00,180 --> 00:48:03,616
FEDERAL AGENCY?

1031
00:48:03,616 --> 00:48:08,588
ALL YOU DO IS SHOW UP EVERY

1032
00:48:03,616 --> 00:48:08,588
DAY AND DO THE JOB.

1033
00:48:03,616 --> 00:48:08,588
BUT I WANT TO PICK YOUR BRAIN

1034
00:48:08,588 --> 00:48:14,027
ABOUT THIS JOB, ABOUT THIS SHOW,

1035
00:48:08,588 --> 00:48:14,027
BECAUSE I USED TO WATCH THIS

1036
00:48:08,588 --> 00:48:14,027
WHEN SETH MYERS DID IT BY

1037
00:48:14,027 --> 00:48:20,333
HIMSELF WITH NO ONE ELSE.

1038
00:48:14,027 --> 00:48:20,333
AND HE MADE IT LOOK REALLY EASY. YEAH.

1039
00:48:20,333 --> 00:48:23,269
SO YOU SAID YOU WERE HERE TO

1040
00:48:20,333 --> 00:48:23,269
TALK ABOUT THE GOVERNMENT. YEAH.

1041
00:48:23,269 --> 00:48:29,242
BUT QUICK QUESTION.

1042
00:48:23,269 --> 00:48:29,242
PRESIDENT BIDEN, WHEN HE ZOOMED

1043
00:48:23,269 --> 00:48:29,242
IN BEFORE, COULD HE SEE ME, OR

1044
00:48:29,242 --> 00:48:33,613
WERE THE CAMERAS ON?

1045
00:48:29,242 --> 00:48:33,613
I THINK HE PRERECORDED THAT. OH.

1046
00:48:33,613 --> 00:48:40,086
I THOUGHT THIS SHOW WAS LIFE.

1047
00:48:33,613 --> 00:48:40,086
WELL, MOST OF IT IS.

1048
00:48:33,613 --> 00:48:40,086
OH, MY GOD.

1049
00:48:40,086 --> 00:48:44,257
CAN WE PLEASE GO?

1050
00:48:40,086 --> 00:48:44,257
THIS GUY HAS BEEN BOTHERING ME

1051
00:48:40,086 --> 00:48:44,257
FOR A HALF AN HOUR.

1052
00:48:44,257 --> 00:48:51,531
WE CAN'T STAY LONG.

1053
00:48:44,257 --> 00:48:51,531
WE HAVE A TIMED ENTRY TO THE M&M

1054
00:48:44,257 --> 00:48:51,531
STORE.

1055
00:48:51,531 --> 00:48:58,438
BEFORE WE GO-- AND MAY I BE SO

1056
00:48:51,531 --> 00:48:58,438
BOLD?

1057
00:48:51,531 --> 00:48:58,438
DO YOU MIND IF I TRY TO TELL A

1058
00:48:58,438 --> 00:48:59,673
JOKE?

1059
00:48:58,438 --> 00:48:59,673
I WOULD LOVE THAT. PLEASE.

1060
00:48:59,673 --> 00:49:06,179
THANK YOU.

1061
00:48:59,673 --> 00:49:06,179
THIS FEELS GOOD.

1062
00:48:59,673 --> 00:49:06,179
THIS FEELS NICE.

1063
00:49:06,179 --> 00:49:09,082
OKAY.

1064
00:49:06,179 --> 00:49:09,082
LET'S SEE WHAT YOU GOT. OKAY.

1065
00:49:09,082 --> 00:49:12,585
ALL RIGHT.

1066
00:49:09,082 --> 00:49:12,585
OH, NO.

1067
00:49:09,082 --> 00:49:12,585
THAT'S TOO MEAN.

1068
00:49:12,585 --> 00:49:15,655
OH, WHAT?

1069
00:49:12,585 --> 00:49:15,655
NO.

1070
00:49:12,585 --> 00:49:15,655
THAT'S WAY TOO MEAN.

1071
00:49:15,655 --> 00:49:17,257
NO.

1072
00:49:15,655 --> 00:49:17,257
OKAY.

1073
00:49:15,655 --> 00:49:17,257
I'LL DO THIS ONE.

1074
00:49:17,257 --> 00:49:22,829
A TOWN IN ALASKA HAS LAUNCHED A

1075
00:49:17,257 --> 00:49:22,829
BUS SERVICE FOR PUPPIES.

1076
00:49:17,257 --> 00:49:22,829
THE SERVICE HAS EXPANDED TO

1077
00:49:22,829 --> 00:49:30,637
PUPPIES THANKS TO THE HE ROWIC

1078
00:49:22,829 --> 00:49:30,637
ACTIVISM OF CANINE CIVIL RIGHTS

1079
00:49:30,637 --> 00:49:39,646
ICON, ROSA BARKS.

1080
00:49:30,637 --> 00:49:39,646
I LOVE THAT.

1081
00:49:30,637 --> 00:49:39,646
I'M APRIL

1082
00:49:53,593 --> 00:49:58,832
MY JOB TO KEEP YOU ALL SAFE.

1083
00:49:53,593 --> 00:49:58,832
AND DOING THAT, I MUST TELL THE

1084
00:49:53,593 --> 00:49:58,832
TRUTH OF THIS WAR.

1085
00:49:58,832 --> 00:50:06,773
WHAT'S GOING ON, JAKE SULLY?

1086
00:49:58,832 --> 00:50:06,773
THERE ARE REPORTS THAT HUMANS

1087
00:49:58,832 --> 00:50:06,773
HAVE INFILTRATED THE CLAN.

1088
00:50:06,773 --> 00:50:16,349
I FEAR THERE ARE SKY PEOPLE

1089
00:50:06,773 --> 00:50:16,349
LIVING AMONG US DISGUISED AS AVATARS.

1090
00:50:16,349 --> 00:50:17,851
THAT CAN'T BE. NO.

1091
00:50:16,349 --> 00:50:17,851
THESE ARE OUR BROTHERS AND

1092
00:50:17,851 --> 00:50:24,491
SISTERS.

1093
00:50:17,851 --> 00:50:24,491
WHAT?

1094
00:50:17,851 --> 00:50:24,491
WE GOT HUMANS UP IN HERE?

1095
00:50:24,491 --> 00:50:28,461
NOT COOL, MAN.

1096
00:50:24,491 --> 00:50:28,461
NOT COOL.

1097
00:50:24,491 --> 00:50:28,461
YEAH, I HATE THAT.

1098
00:50:28,461 --> 00:50:33,033
I KNOW IT'S DIFFICULT TO

1099
00:50:28,461 --> 00:50:33,033
PROCESS, BUT WE MUST STAY VIGILANT.

1100
00:50:33,033 --> 00:50:39,372
REPORTS TELL US THAT WE SHOULD

1101
00:50:33,033 --> 00:50:39,372
BE LOOKING FOR TWO FEMALE

1102
00:50:33,033 --> 00:50:39,372
LIEUTENANTS THAT ARE SPIES

1103
00:50:39,372 --> 00:50:47,447
DESCRIBED AS BUTCH LADIES FROM ARIZONA.

1104
00:50:39,372 --> 00:50:47,447
LISTEN UP.

1105
00:50:47,447 --> 00:50:52,986
ALL RIGHT, Y'ALL.

1106
00:50:47,447 --> 00:50:52,986
WE NEED TO BE ON THE LOOKOUT FOR

1107
00:50:47,447 --> 00:50:52,986
SOME GRAND CANYON TYPES.

1108
00:50:52,986 --> 00:50:57,724
JAKE SULLY, IT'S OBVIOUSLY

1109
00:50:52,986 --> 00:50:57,724
THESE TWO.

1110
00:50:52,986 --> 00:50:57,724
VICKIE AND CHRISTINE?

1111
00:50:57,724 --> 00:51:07,834
WHOA!

1112
00:50:57,724 --> 00:51:07,834
YOU SERIOUS RIGHT NOW, FRITO?

1113
00:50:57,724 --> 00:51:07,834
COME ON, FRITO?

1114
00:51:07,834 --> 00:51:15,075
EVERYONE, BE CALM.

1115
00:51:07,834 --> 00:51:15,075
NOW THESE WITH BIG ACCUSATIONS, FRIOTE.

1116
00:51:15,075 --> 00:51:18,478
THANK YOU.

1117
00:51:15,075 --> 00:51:18,478
APPRECIATE IT.

1118
00:51:15,075 --> 00:51:18,478
THAT'S JAKE.

1119
00:51:18,478 --> 00:51:21,915
WAIT.

1120
00:51:18,478 --> 00:51:21,915
YEAH.

1121
00:51:18,478 --> 00:51:21,915
NOW THAT I THINK ABOUT IT, THEY

1122
00:51:21,915 --> 00:51:29,389
DO ALWAYS LOOK DOWN AT THEIR OWN

1123
00:51:21,915 --> 00:51:29,389
BODIES AND SAY OUT LOUD, WHOA,

1124
00:51:21,915 --> 00:51:29,389
THIS IS CRAZY.

1125
00:51:29,389 --> 00:51:35,261
WHOA.

1126
00:51:29,389 --> 00:51:35,261
BRO, YOURS IS WILD.

1127
00:51:29,389 --> 00:51:35,261
IT ALL MAKES SENSE.

1128
00:51:35,261 --> 00:51:44,004
IS THAT WHY THEY CALL THEMSELVES

1129
00:51:35,261 --> 00:51:44,004
THE MARICOPE COUNTER OF MILF

1130
00:51:35,261 --> 00:51:44,004
HUNTERS?

1131
00:51:44,004 --> 00:51:49,376
AND WHY ARE THEY WEARING

1132
00:51:44,004 --> 00:51:49,376
COMPLETELY DIFFERENT CLOTHING?

1133
00:51:44,004 --> 00:51:49,376
WHOA, WHAT HAPPENED TO WOMEN

1134
00:51:49,376 --> 00:51:52,979
SUPPORTING WOMEN, BITCH?

1135
00:51:49,376 --> 00:51:52,979
SERIOUSLY.

1136
00:51:49,376 --> 00:51:52,979
OKAY?

1137
00:51:52,979 --> 00:52:01,187
WE'RE COOL WITH LETTING OUR NIPS

1138
00:51:52,979 --> 00:52:01,187
FLY SOMETIMES, AND MAYBE WE'RE

1139
00:51:52,979 --> 00:52:01,187
NOT AS COMFORTABLE IN THONGS.

1140
00:52:01,187 --> 00:52:08,395
I'M LOOKING AT YOU, CHEESE BURGER.

1141
00:52:01,187 --> 00:52:08,395
LISTEN, GUYS, OUR SKIN'S

1142
00:52:08,395 --> 00:52:15,669
BLUE, AND I THINK WE KNOW HOW TO

1143
00:52:08,395 --> 00:52:15,669
USE OUR TAILS.

1144
00:52:08,395 --> 00:52:15,669
I THINK WE KNOW.

1145
00:52:15,669 --> 00:52:26,780
HOW LONG WAS I OUT?

1146
00:52:15,669 --> 00:52:26,780

1147
00:52:15,669 --> 00:52:26,780

LIVING WITH HIV?

1251
00:57:39,893 --> 00:57:44,197
I LEARNED I COULD SAY

00:57:39,893 --> 00:57:44,197
UNDETECTABLE WITH FEWER MEDICINES.

LESS, AND IT'S JUST AS

1266
00:58:05,585 --> 00:58:10,490
I CAN DO A LITTLE MORE.

1267
00:58:10,490 --> 00:58:16,696

YOU MAYBE AD LIBBED A BIT AT THE END.

1271
00:58:16,696 --> 00:58:24,304
THE LINE IS THAT'S WHY I

1272
00:58:24,304 --> 00:58:32,545
SWITCHED TO DOVATO HIV TREATMENT

1273
00:58:24,304 --> 00:58:32,545
THEN FULL STOP.

1274
00:58:24,304 --> 00:58:32,545

FEWER MEDICINES.

1280
00:58:35,949 --> 00:58:42,355
MOST HIV PILLS HAVE SO MANY

1281
00:58:42,355 --> 00:58:49,662
MEDICINES, BUT DOVATO HAS LESS,

1282
00:58:42,355 --> 00:58:49,662
AND IT'S JUST AS EFFECTIVE.

1283
00:58:42,355 --> 00:58:49,662
THAT'S WHY I SWITCHED TO

1284
00:58:49,662 --> 00:58:54,300
DOVATO HIV TREATMENT.

1285
00:58:49,662 --> 00:58:54,300
FACT, YOU CAN GET HIV FROM A GIRL.

1286
00:58:54,300 --> 00:59:00,073
THAT'S HOW I DID IT.

1287
00:58:54,300 --> 00:59:00,073
CUT!

1288
00:58:54,300 --> 00:59:00,073

YEAH.

1291
00:59:00,073 --> 00:59:03,877

1301
00:59:21,027 --> 00:59:26,199

00:59:41,047 --> 00:59:46,219
SALAD GETS COLD.

1316
00:59:41,047 --> 00:59:46,219
IT'S A HOT SALAD.

1317
00:59:46,219 --> 00:59:50,724
AND ACTION.

1318
00:59:46,219 --> 00:59:50,724
LIVING WITH HIV, I LEARNED I

1319
00:59:46,219 --> 00:59:50,724
COULD STAY UNDETECTABLE WITH

1320
00:59:50,724 --> 00:59:54,327
FEWER MEDICINES.

1321
00:59:50,724 --> 00:59:54,327
IT'S A GAY CLUB. WHAT.

1322
00:59:54,327 --> 00:59:59,733
I MEAN, I'M COOL WITH THAT, I

1323
00:59:54,327 --> 00:59:59,733
JUST DIDN'T KNOW THAT. OKAY.

1324
00:59:59,733 --> 01:00:04,104
FACT.

1325
00:59:59,733 --> 01:00:04,104
THERE BE MAD STRAIGHT GIRLS AT

1326
00:59:59,733 --> 01:00:04,104
THE GAY CLUBS, AND THEY BE

1327
01:00:04,104 --> 01:00:09,609
READY, AND THAT'S WHERE I COME IN.

1328
01:00:04,104 --> 01:00:09,609
CAN SOMEBODY PLEASE YELL CUT?

1329
01:00:09,609 --> 01:00:10,744
CUT.

1330
01:00:09,609 --> 01:00:10,744
CUT.

1331
01:00:09,609 --> 01:00:10,744
CUT.

1332
01:00:10,744 --> 01:00:17,417
SORRY.

1333
01:00:10,744 --> 01:00:17,417
SORRY.

1334
01:00:10,744 --> 01:00:17,417
I TOOK A QUICK BITE OF MY HOT

1335
01:00:17,417 --> 01:00:20,820
SALAD.

1336
01:00:17,417 --> 01:00:20,820
IT BURNED THE ROOF OF MY MOUTH.

1337
01:00:17,417 --> 01:00:20,820
HOW DID I DO?

1338
01:00:20,820 --> 01:00:25,925
IT WAS THE WORST THING I'VE

1339
01:00:20,820 --> 01:00:25,925
EVER SEEN BESIDES TOMMY'S

1340
01:00:20,820 --> 01:00:25,925
DANCING.

1341
01:00:25,925 --> 01:00:31,164
I'M TRYING.

1342
01:00:25,925 --> 01:00:31,164
I JUST FEEL LIKE SINCE I'M

1343
01:00:25,925 --> 01:00:31,164
STRAIGHT, MY GUY SHOULD BE

1344
01:00:31,164 --> 01:00:36,002
STRAIGHT TOO.

1345
01:00:31,164 --> 01:00:36,002
IT'S JUST ACTING, BRO.

1346
01:00:31,164 --> 01:00:36,002
I'M NOT ACTUALLY GAY EITHER.

1347
01:00:36,002 --> 01:00:40,674
OKAY.

1348
01:00:36,002 --> 01:00:40,674
JAMAL, IF YOU'RE

1349
01:00:36,002 --> 01:00:40,674
UNCOMFORTABLE, WE CAN JUST GIVE

1350
01:00:40,674 --> 01:00:46,579
YOUR LINES TO MARIO.

1351
01:00:40,674 --> 01:00:46,579
DO I STILL GET PAID THE SAME?

1352
01:00:40,674 --> 01:00:46,579
YOU DON'T GET PAID.

1353
01:00:46,579 --> 01:00:50,183
YOU JUST GO HOME.

1354
01:00:46,579 --> 01:00:50,183
I NEED THIS JOB.

1355
01:00:46,579 --> 01:00:50,183
THEN SAY THE LINES.

1356
01:00:50,183 --> 01:00:56,322
WHAT IF MY GUY GOT HIV FROM

1357
01:00:50,183 --> 01:00:56,322
BASKETBALL LIKE MAGIC JOHNSON.

1358
01:00:50,183 --> 01:00:56,322
I APPRECIATE YOU COMING DOWN,

1359
01:00:56,322 --> 01:01:00,160
BUT CLEARLY YOU'RE NOT MATURE

1360
01:00:56,322 --> 01:01:00,160
ENOUGH TO HANDLE THIS ROLE, JAMAL.

1361
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:04,064
THAT'S A FACT.

1362
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:04,064
SO WHY DON'T YOU AND TOMMY

1363
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:04,064
JUST LEAVE, PLEASE?

1364
01:01:04,064 --> 01:01:08,068
SO WHY DON'T YOU AND TOMMY

1365
01:01:04,064 --> 01:01:08,068
JUST LEAVE, PLEASE?

1366
01:01:04,064 --> 01:01:08,068
WAIT, ME?

1367
01:01:23,983 --> 01:01:34,260
THERE WAS SOMETHING ABOUT THIS

1368
01:01:23,983 --> 01:01:34,260
CASE I COULDN'T SHAKE.

1369
01:01:23,983 --> 01:01:34,260
A MAN WHO EATS DINNER EARLY.

1370
01:01:34,260 --> 01:01:36,863
I LIKE THAT.

1371
01:01:34,260 --> 01:01:36,863
HOW THE HELL DID YOU GET IN

1372
01:01:34,260 --> 01:01:36,863
HERE?

1373
01:01:36,863 --> 01:01:40,567
YOU HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING ME.

1374
01:01:36,863 --> 01:01:40,567
WHY?

1375
01:01:36,863 --> 01:01:40,567
YOUR HUSBAND IS DEAD, AND I

1376
01:01:40,567 --> 01:01:46,272
THINK YOU KILLED HIM.

1377
01:01:40,567 --> 01:01:46,272
I DIDN'T KILL ANYONE

1378
01:01:40,567 --> 01:01:46,272
MISTER--

1379
01:01:46,272 --> 01:01:49,242
RALLY.

1380
01:01:46,272 --> 01:01:49,242
I LOVED MY HUSBAND,

1381
01:01:46,272 --> 01:01:49,242
MR. RALLY.

1382
01:01:49,242 --> 01:01:54,681
HE ARGUED WITH THE RADIO, REALLY

1383
01:01:49,242 --> 01:01:54,681
KNEW HOW TO STINK UP A CHAIR.

1384
01:01:49,242 --> 01:01:54,681
SOUNDS LIKE AN OLD MAN.

1385
01:01:54,681 --> 01:01:58,118
HE WAS.

1386
01:01:54,681 --> 01:01:58,118
THEY ALL WERE, EACH ONE OLDER

1387
01:01:54,681 --> 01:01:58,118
THAN THE LAST.

1388
01:01:58,118 --> 01:02:03,757
WHEN I MEET A MAN WITH GLASSES

1389
01:01:58,118 --> 01:02:03,757
APP PANTS UP TO HIS CHEST, I GO

1390
01:01:58,118 --> 01:02:03,757
HEAD OVER HEELS.

1391
01:02:03,757 --> 01:02:07,761
HOW IS IT THEY ALL END UP

1392
01:02:03,757 --> 01:02:07,761
DEAD?

1393
01:02:03,757 --> 01:02:07,761
BECAUSE THEY'RE OLD.

1394
01:02:07,761 --> 01:02:15,068
THE AUTOPSY REPORT SAYS EVERY

1395
01:02:07,761 --> 01:02:15,068
MAN YOU MARRY DIES AFTER NATURAL CAUSES.

1396
01:02:15,068 --> 01:02:21,975
WHAT'S NATURAL ABOUT THAT?

1397
01:02:15,068 --> 01:02:21,975
THE CAUSES.

1398
01:02:15,068 --> 01:02:21,975
I LIKE THE WAY THEIR KISSES

1399
01:02:21,975 --> 01:02:28,148
TASTE LIKE A COUGH, HOW THEY

1400
01:02:21,975 --> 01:02:28,148
CAN'T FIND THEIR GLASSES, AND

1401
01:02:21,975 --> 01:02:28,148
THE WAY THEY MAKE LOVE, OH, HOLD

1402
01:02:28,148 --> 01:02:33,620
ON, OUCH, OUCH, SORRY.

1403
01:02:28,148 --> 01:02:33,620
LET ME JUST DO YOU.

1404
01:02:28,148 --> 01:02:33,620
I'M STARTING TO GET THE

1405
01:02:33,620 --> 01:02:41,094
PICTURE.

1406
01:02:33,620 --> 01:02:41,094
IS IT A CRIME TO WANT A MAN

1407
01:02:33,620 --> 01:02:41,094
WHO BEGS ME TO DRIVE HIM TO

1408
01:02:41,094 --> 01:02:45,732
CHURCH AND SLEEPS THE WHOLE

1409
01:02:41,094 --> 01:02:45,732
TIME?

1410
01:02:41,094 --> 01:02:45,732
IS A GUY WHO NEVER USES HIS TURN

1411
01:02:45,732 --> 01:02:50,570
SIGNAL AND SCREAMS AT RACCOONS

1412
01:02:45,732 --> 01:02:50,570
IN HIS YARD.

1413
01:02:45,732 --> 01:02:50,570
LISTEN, YOU GOT A THING, I

1414
01:02:50,570 --> 01:02:54,407
GET THAT.

1415
01:02:50,570 --> 01:02:54,407
I JUST DON'T KNOW WHY PEOPLE

1416
01:02:50,570 --> 01:02:54,407
LIKE TO TELL EVERYBODY WHAT

1417
01:02:54,407 --> 01:02:58,745
THEIR THING IS THESE DAYS. OH.

1418
01:02:54,407 --> 01:02:58,745
GETTING ANGRY AT PEOPLE THESE

1419
01:02:58,745 --> 01:03:06,152
DAYS, MR. RALLY?

1420
01:02:58,745 --> 01:03:06,152
ARE YOU TRYING TO SEDUCE ME?

1421
01:02:58,745 --> 01:03:06,152
I'M TOO YOUNG FOR YOU, LADY.

1422
01:03:06,152 --> 01:03:10,690
I'M 33.

1423
01:03:06,152 --> 01:03:10,690
I JUST LOOK OLDER BECAUSE I'M AN ALCOHOLIC.

1424
01:03:10,690 --> 01:03:15,562
SO NOW MAYBE YOU CAN TELL ME

1425
01:03:10,690 --> 01:03:15,562
WHAT YOUR THING IS.

1426
01:03:10,690 --> 01:03:15,562
WHAT STARTS YOUR ENGINE,

1427
01:03:15,562 --> 01:03:21,634
MR. RALLY?

1428
01:03:15,562 --> 01:03:21,634
YOU REALLY WANT TO KNOW?

1429
01:03:15,562 --> 01:03:21,634
PANTY HOSE, JUST LADIES WITH

1430
01:03:21,634 --> 01:03:24,704
NICE LEGS IN TIGHTS.

1431
01:03:21,634 --> 01:03:24,704
BUT I HAVE A QUESTION FOR YOU, BABY.

1432
01:03:24,704 --> 01:03:35,115
WHO THE HELL IS THIS?

1433
01:03:24,704 --> 01:03:35,115
MOTHER!

1434
01:03:24,704 --> 01:03:35,115
DARLING.

1435
01:03:35,115 --> 01:03:42,922
WHO'S THIS LITTLE SNACK?

1436
01:03:35,115 --> 01:03:42,922
YOU CAN'T HAVE HIM, MOTHER.

1437
01:03:35,115 --> 01:03:42,922
DON'T BE CROSS WITH ME,

1438
01:03:42,922 --> 01:03:47,660
DARLING.

1439
01:03:42,922 --> 01:03:47,660
I CAN'T RESIST A MAN WITH A DEEP

1440
01:03:42,922 --> 01:03:47,660
VOICE AND A BIG NOSE.

1441
01:03:47,660 --> 01:03:53,133
OF COURSE A KNOCKOUT WALKS IN

1442
01:03:47,660 --> 01:03:53,133
THE NIGHT BEFORE MY RHINO PLACETY.

1443
01:03:53,133 --> 01:03:58,371
DON'T DO IT.

1444
01:03:53,133 --> 01:03:58,371
I WANTED YOU TO GROW OLD WITH ME.

1445
01:03:58,371 --> 01:04:05,879
SORE WE, SISTER, I LIKE THEM

1446
01:03:58,371 --> 01:04:05,879
DESPERATE AND COOKY BECAUSE I

1447
01:03:58,371 --> 01:04:05,879
KNOW THEY WON'T GIVE ME A HARD

1448
01:04:05,879 --> 01:04:10,717
TIME ABOUT THE BOOZE.

1449
01:04:05,879 --> 01:04:10,717
I'M GOING TO TAKE YOUR MOTHER

1450
01:04:05,879 --> 01:04:10,717
OUT TO THE CLUB TO DO SOME

1451
01:04:10,717 --> 01:04:13,253
STUPID DANCES.

1452
01:04:10,717 --> 01:04:13,253
BUT FIRST, YOU'RE GOING TO GIVE

1453
01:04:10,717 --> 01:04:13,253
ME THAT GUN.

1454
01:04:13,253 --> 01:04:20,527
NO!

1455
01:04:13,253 --> 01:04:20,527
THERE I WAS, DYING IN MY

1456
01:04:13,253 --> 01:04:20,527
OFFICE, MURDERED FOR REASONS

1457
01:04:20,527 --> 01:04:27,467
THAT WOULD THROW OLD SIGGY FROID

1458
01:04:20,527 --> 01:04:27,467
FOR A LOOP.

1459
01:04:20,527 --> 01:04:27,467
I GUESS YOU NEVER SOLVE YOUR

1460
01:04:27,467 --> 01:04:31,805
LAST CASE.

1461
01:04:27,467 --> 01:04:31,805
WHO WAS PAYING ME ANYWAY?

1462
01:04:31,805 --> 01:04:38,211
WELL, TIME TO DIE, I GUESS.

1463
01:04:31,805 --> 01:04:38,211
THAT'S JUST HOW THINGS GO IN THE

1464
01:04:31,805 --> 01:04:38,211
MIDTOWN EAST IN THE LOW 60s.

1465
01:05:02,902 --> 01:05:16,683
MY MOTHER, THANK YOU AND HAVE A

1466
01:05:02,902 --> 01:05:16,683
GOOD NIGHT!

1467
01:05:02,902 --> 01:05:16,683
DREAMS REALLY DO COME TRUE!
