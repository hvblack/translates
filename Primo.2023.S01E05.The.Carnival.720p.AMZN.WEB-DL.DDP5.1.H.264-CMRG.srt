1
00:00:01,374 --> 00:00:05,211
{\an8}All right. Classifieds for Mom.

2
00:00:05,294 --> 00:00:07,380
Financial section for Uncle Ryan,

3
00:00:07,838 --> 00:00:09,382
Crosswords for Uncle Rollie.

4
00:00:10,341 --> 00:00:11,467
Where's Uncle Rollie?

5
00:00:11,551 --> 00:00:12,385
I don't know.

6
00:00:13,803 --> 00:00:15,346
Obituaries for Uncle Mike,

7
00:00:15,429 --> 00:00:17,723
so he can see
if any of his enemies have died.

8
00:00:17,807 --> 00:00:19,475
Come on, Richard Soto.

9
00:00:19,559 --> 00:00:21,143
- What'd he do to you?
- I don't remember.

10
00:00:21,227 --> 00:00:22,687
I just know that I want him dead.

11
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:26,899
Uncle Mondo gets the horoscopes,
and everything else for Uncle Jay,

12
00:00:26,983 --> 00:00:28,609
so he can throw it all in the trash

13
00:00:28,693 --> 00:00:31,070
'cause he's still mad
about the typo in his ad last year.

14
00:00:31,153 --> 00:00:34,407
I was very clear.
"Hose." H-O-S-E.

15
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:38,077
We're an irrigation company.
That kind of "hose." Not the other kind.

16
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:41,163
- Rollie's in jail.

17
00:00:41,247 --> 00:00:42,707
He needs to be bailed out again.

18
00:00:45,042 --> 00:00:47,503
- Mike.
- Damn it.

19
00:00:48,713 --> 00:00:52,133
Mondo, I'll do your laundry
if you go pick up Rollie for me.

20
00:00:52,216 --> 00:00:53,551
Hmm. Deal.

21
00:00:54,677 --> 00:00:56,012
Ryan, if you go get Rollie,

22
00:00:56,095 --> 00:00:58,347
I'll let you explain crypto to me
for 20 minutes.

23
00:00:58,431 --> 00:01:01,058
Deal. Smartest decision you've ever made.

24
00:01:01,142 --> 00:01:04,186
Jay, your daughter's still doing
a fundraiser for their dance recital

25
00:01:04,270 --> 00:01:07,315
because I would now
love to make a donation?

26
00:01:07,398 --> 00:01:08,649
Deal.

27
00:01:08,733 --> 00:01:09,900
- Mike?
-  Hmm.

28
00:01:09,984 --> 00:01:11,110
If you go get Rollie,

29
00:01:11,193 --> 00:01:13,571
I won't tell anyone
about your secret Tinder profile.

30
00:01:13,654 --> 00:01:15,031
- Hmm.
- You know about that?

31
00:01:15,114 --> 00:01:16,907
I've been cat-fishing you for a month.

32
00:01:17,908 --> 00:01:19,994
- You're "Jae?"
- I didn't even change my name.

33
00:01:20,077 --> 00:01:21,329
This is on you.

34
00:01:21,412 --> 00:01:24,248
And if you don't want everyone else
to see the screenshots I took...

35
00:01:27,335 --> 00:01:29,545
And here's my laundry.

36
00:01:30,296 --> 00:01:32,340
- Can you drop me at the school after?
- Sure.

37
00:01:32,423 --> 00:01:34,050
Does anybody else
have any more jobs I can do?

38
00:01:34,133 --> 00:01:35,551
- Oh, no, I'm good.

39
00:01:35,635 --> 00:01:37,303
You sure?
Great.

40
00:01:43,768 --> 00:01:46,187
You're gonna show us
the screenshots though, right?

41
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:47,396
Yes.

42
00:01:55,467 --> 00:01:57,804
Carnival

43
00:01:58,991 --> 00:02:03,037
All right, guys.
Fifteen across, "Source of agony."

44
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,163
Eight letters.

45
00:02:05,706 --> 00:02:07,708
- Knife.
- That's five letters.

46
00:02:09,251 --> 00:02:10,336
Big knife.

47
00:02:12,004 --> 00:02:13,798
Try some non knife words.

48
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:15,925
-  Gonzales.
-  What's up?

49
00:02:17,218 --> 00:02:18,803
Your family bailed you out.

50
00:02:18,886 --> 00:02:22,306
All right, Viper.
Finish this off for me. I believe in you.

51
00:02:27,687 --> 00:02:29,480
Machetes.

52
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:31,732
There's a lesson here, Primo.

53
00:02:31,816 --> 00:02:34,985
Yes, I was in jail.
But I did it for a good reason.

54
00:02:35,069 --> 00:02:37,446
Some idiot was trying to
dine and dash on a waitress,

55
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:39,031
so I had to knock him out.

56
00:02:39,115 --> 00:02:41,200
And I knew
it'd probably get me into trouble,

57
00:02:41,283 --> 00:02:43,411
but I did it
for the principle of the matter.

58
00:02:43,494 --> 00:02:46,288
You head-butted a guy
at a strip club buffet.

59
00:02:46,372 --> 00:02:48,416
Yeah. I did what I had to do
to right the wrong.

60
00:02:48,499 --> 00:02:51,210
Whoa, you're like Mexican Batman.

61
00:02:51,293 --> 00:02:53,045
- No.
-  Yeah, that's right.

62
00:02:53,129 --> 00:02:54,880
I'm a vigilante for justice.

63
00:02:54,964 --> 00:02:57,633
That's why I have
a tattoo of Lady Justice.

64
00:02:59,468 --> 00:03:02,138
Is that Halle Berry?
Yeah.

65
00:03:02,221 --> 00:03:04,223
Yeah, she used to be married
to David Justice,

66
00:03:04,306 --> 00:03:06,183
so she was Lady Justice.

67
00:03:06,267 --> 00:03:08,269
- Oh.
- Do you see, Primo?

68
00:03:08,352 --> 00:03:10,563
I'm always sticking up for the little guy.

69
00:03:10,646 --> 00:03:12,022
Like your Uncle Mike.

70
00:03:12,106 --> 00:03:15,151
Look how little he is,
with his cute, tiny Lego body.

71
00:03:15,234 --> 00:03:17,737
Okay. Primo, go get the truck.

72
00:03:22,283 --> 00:03:25,161
Stop making yourself sound like a hero
in front of Primo.

73
00:03:25,244 --> 00:03:26,704
I could try, but it's kind of hard

74
00:03:26,787 --> 00:03:28,748
when you look like
a chiseled Marc Anthony.

75
00:03:28,831 --> 00:03:31,333
Rollie, you get locked up once a month.

76
00:03:31,417 --> 00:03:33,711
I didn't even have to say your name
when I walked in today.

77
00:03:33,794 --> 00:03:36,213
You are a regular. In jail.

78
00:03:37,131 --> 00:03:39,091
Primo looks up to you, man.

79
00:03:39,175 --> 00:03:42,303
Oh, I get it now.

80
00:03:42,386 --> 00:03:44,972
You're just jealous
because he doesn't look up to you.

81
00:03:45,055 --> 00:03:47,183
Because he can't, 'cause you're short.

82
00:03:47,266 --> 00:03:50,352
First of all, I'm taller than Tom Cruise,
People's Sexiest Man Alive in 1990.

83
00:03:50,436 --> 00:03:52,271
- Eh.
- Second of all,

84
00:03:52,354 --> 00:03:54,982
Primo might be able to go to college.

85
00:03:55,065 --> 00:03:57,818
He has a chance to use his head,
and not as a weapon.

86
00:03:57,902 --> 00:04:01,197
So if he starts doing the dumb crap you do
'cause he thinks that's cool,

87
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,323
that's on you.

88
00:04:03,449 --> 00:04:05,534
Is that what you want for Primo?

89
00:04:10,289 --> 00:04:14,126
What? Your Uncle Rollie?
He's not Mexican Batman.

90
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:15,753
I thought Danny Trejo was Mexican Batman?

91
00:04:15,836 --> 00:04:16,921
I'm telling you, guys.

92
00:04:17,004 --> 00:04:20,549
He's kind of a playboy,
he only goes out at night and, uh--

93
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:24,678
dude, you know what?
Now that I think about it,
he's been in a bunch of fights

94
00:04:24,678 --> 00:04:26,055
with a dude named "Joker."

95
00:04:26,138 --> 00:04:27,431
Isn't Batman a billionaire?

96
00:04:27,515 --> 00:04:30,267
Yeah. That's where the similarities end.

97
00:04:30,351 --> 00:04:32,478
He's working at the carnival tonight,
so we'll see him there.

98
00:04:32,561 --> 00:04:33,687
Wait, there's a carnival?

99
00:04:33,771 --> 00:04:35,272
Yeah.
Well, it's like a seasonal thing.

100
00:04:35,356 --> 00:04:37,483
And we go every year
the first weekend it opens up.

101
00:04:37,566 --> 00:04:38,609
And tonight's the first night.

102
00:04:38,692 --> 00:04:40,069
I love carnivals.

103
00:04:40,152 --> 00:04:42,238
When we lived in Germany,
there was one called Spargelfest.

104
00:04:42,321 --> 00:04:45,074
All the rides and attractions
were asparagus-themed.

105
00:04:48,202 --> 00:04:49,495
Do you have any cotton candy?

106
00:04:49,662 --> 00:04:50,538
No.

107
00:04:50,621 --> 00:04:51,664
Only asparagus.

108
00:04:52,122 --> 00:04:53,165
{\an8}Asparagus. Asparagus.

109
00:04:53,332 --> 00:04:54,375
Asparagus.

110
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:55,876
Asparagus.

111
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:59,338
You should come with us tonight.
Unless you have plans.

112
00:04:59,421 --> 00:05:01,090
I was just gonna
hang out with my mom.

113
00:05:01,173 --> 00:05:03,551
On Friday night, she likes to drink
two glasses of white wine

114
00:05:03,634 --> 00:05:05,052
and watch  Remember the Titans.

115
00:05:05,135 --> 00:05:08,973
But this sounds like more fun.

116
00:05:09,056 --> 00:05:11,392
- Hey, I'mma see you all tonight, okay?
- See ya.

117
00:05:14,687 --> 00:05:15,855
Dude.

118
00:05:15,938 --> 00:05:17,147
What?

119
00:05:20,776 --> 00:05:23,487
Oh, my God.
Mya's coming to the carnival with us.

120
00:05:23,571 --> 00:05:24,613
At night.

121
00:05:24,697 --> 00:05:26,448
You basically just asked her out.

122
00:05:26,532 --> 00:05:27,700
No, I didn't.

123
00:05:28,909 --> 00:05:31,245
- I did?
- Yeah. This is big.

124
00:05:31,328 --> 00:05:34,915
People make out at carnivals all the time.
I should know.

125
00:05:38,168 --> 00:05:39,670
Awesome.

126
00:05:39,753 --> 00:05:41,964
Great time. Ugh.

127
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:48,012
Wait. But I mean,
she doesn't like me like that.

128
00:05:48,971 --> 00:05:50,097
Does she?

129
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:52,600
If she doesn't,
this is your chance to change that.

130
00:05:52,683 --> 00:05:54,727
Rafa, the girl was excited
about asparagus.

131
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:57,187
Now, all you gotta do
is be more interesting than a vegetable.

132
00:05:57,271 --> 00:06:00,524
Yeah. I can do that.
I think I can do that.

133
00:06:01,525 --> 00:06:04,153
I mean, asparagus is the most
dynamic vegetable, though.

134
00:06:04,236 --> 00:06:06,655
Like it starts out one way,
and then it gets complicated

135
00:06:06,739 --> 00:06:09,408
at the top in a way
that you just don't see coming.

136
00:06:10,367 --> 00:06:12,745
What's the second most dynamic vegetable?

137
00:06:12,828 --> 00:06:14,663
Tomatoes.
You can put it in meats and salads.

138
00:06:14,747 --> 00:06:16,916
- Tomato is a fruit, though.
- Yeah. Exactly.

139
00:06:16,999 --> 00:06:20,294
Another reason why it's one of
the most dynamic. It's unstoppable.

140
00:06:20,377 --> 00:06:22,129
It goes asparagus, tomato, cabbage.

141
00:06:22,796 --> 00:06:23,964
I'm not going tonight.

142
00:06:24,048 --> 00:06:26,216
Crows, pigeons, hawks?

143
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:27,676
Don't say another one.

144
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,595
What are you guys fighting about?

145
00:06:29,678 --> 00:06:31,055
- Give it a rest!
-  Owls.

146
00:06:35,976 --> 00:06:38,270
- What did you do?
- It's his fault.

147
00:06:38,354 --> 00:06:40,814
- He keeps saying birds don't get tired.
- They don't.

148
00:06:40,898 --> 00:06:42,691
Have you ever seen a bird
just be out of breath?

149
00:06:42,775 --> 00:06:44,610
Then why do they sleep,
if they don't get tired?

150
00:06:44,693 --> 00:06:46,403
-  Shut up!
- Enough.

151
00:06:47,655 --> 00:06:49,865
Fix this. Now.

152
00:06:49,949 --> 00:06:51,992
Relax. It's not a big deal.

153
00:06:52,076 --> 00:06:54,828
It's just an old bookshelf.
We'll get you a brand new one.

154
00:06:54,912 --> 00:06:58,457
I know a place that has great bookshelves.
And meatballs.

155
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:00,626
- Is it IKEA?
- It's IKEA.

156
00:07:00,709 --> 00:07:03,545
I don't want a new bookshelf, Ryan.
I want this bookshelf.

157
00:07:03,629 --> 00:07:05,172
And I want it back the way it was.

158
00:07:07,841 --> 00:07:09,259
Sons of bitches!

159
00:07:10,302 --> 00:07:14,014
Birds just do this all day.
Big whoop.

160
00:07:15,808 --> 00:07:19,687
Oh, I feel it now. Birds are amazing.

161
00:07:24,984 --> 00:07:28,404
Hey. Thank you for letting me
borrow this outfit, Uncle Mike.

162
00:07:28,487 --> 00:07:29,488
I look sick as hell.

163
00:07:29,571 --> 00:07:30,823
Yeah, you do.

164
00:07:30,906 --> 00:07:33,367
The salesgirl at Express Men
said I looked "dope."

165
00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:35,869
And salesgirls,
they have no reason to lie to you.

166
00:07:35,953 --> 00:07:39,164
This shirt is so slippery.
I feel like a sexy snake. Yeah.

167
00:07:39,248 --> 00:07:40,624
I'll pick you up at 11:00.

168
00:07:40,708 --> 00:07:43,085
- And steer clear of Uncle Rollie.
- Why?

169
00:07:43,168 --> 00:07:45,462
He's gonna be with his carney friends.
You know?

170
00:07:45,546 --> 00:07:47,423
Who knows what he'll go
bash his head into.

171
00:07:47,506 --> 00:07:49,967
- Okay.
- Oh, also, stay away from open flames.

172
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:52,011
Those pants will melt
right into your thighs.

173
00:07:52,553 --> 00:07:54,888
- Oh.
- Have fun.

174
00:08:01,854 --> 00:08:05,566
Dude, what are you wearing?
You look like a giant fishing lure.

175
00:08:05,649 --> 00:08:08,027
Well, it can't be a date
if I don't dress like it's a date.

176
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:10,654
Which uncle did this?
Because this can't be all you.

177
00:08:10,738 --> 00:08:13,365
Uncle Mike. Y'all don't like it?

178
00:08:13,449 --> 00:08:15,784
She's 's gonna think
you're a divorced magician.

179
00:08:16,869 --> 00:08:19,872
What's up, guys? Rafa, you look cool.

180
00:08:19,955 --> 00:08:23,500
Thank you, Mya.
They're my uncle's clothes.

181
00:08:29,256 --> 00:08:30,632
Okay. Let's go.

182
00:08:36,722 --> 00:08:40,142
Hey, Dad. I'm here.
Yeah, I met up with my friends.

183
00:08:40,225 --> 00:08:42,519
I'll see you at 11:00?

184
00:08:42,603 --> 00:08:45,814
No, there's no boys here.
It's the first ever all-female carnival.

185
00:08:47,066 --> 00:08:49,777
Okay. See you at 10:30. Bye.

186
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:51,945
I thought you just said
your curfew was 11:00?

187
00:08:52,029 --> 00:08:54,114
Yeah, he docked me a half hour
'cause I mouthed off.

188
00:08:54,198 --> 00:08:55,199
My daddy don't play.

189
00:08:55,282 --> 00:08:57,493
So, what rides y'all wanna get on first?

190
00:08:57,576 --> 00:08:59,244
I don't waste time on those kiddie rides.

191
00:08:59,328 --> 00:09:01,830
I am here to meet girls,
and spend no money doing it.

192
00:09:01,914 --> 00:09:03,415
And how are you gonna pull that off?

193
00:09:03,499 --> 00:09:07,211
He packs his own popcorn and candy.
He hangs out by the carousel.

194
00:09:07,294 --> 00:09:08,587
It's a very romantic ride.

195
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:10,214
Then there's the closer.

196
00:09:11,173 --> 00:09:13,258
I won this baby three years ago,

197
00:09:13,342 --> 00:09:16,136
but I carry it around
so the ladies think I won it tonight.

198
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:19,223
- Hmm.
-  See, I don't go on any rides,
because I have no money,

199
00:09:19,306 --> 00:09:22,017
so my entertainment is
watching Harris try and talk to girls.

200
00:09:22,101 --> 00:09:24,520
Because it never works.
And that's always funny.

201
00:09:25,979 --> 00:09:27,606
Wait, wait, wait. Where's my money?

202
00:09:27,689 --> 00:09:29,983
It was in my pocket
and now it's not there.

203
00:09:30,067 --> 00:09:31,568
Shit.

204
00:09:31,652 --> 00:09:32,861
There it is.

205
00:09:36,782 --> 00:09:38,158
Hey! That's my money!

206
00:09:39,952 --> 00:09:41,078
Come on!

207
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:43,789
Harris! Hurry up!

208
00:09:43,872 --> 00:09:47,042
If I jostle the unicorn too hard,
the horn's gonna falls off!

209
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:52,005
We did it. Good as new.

210
00:09:52,089 --> 00:09:55,259
No, it's not. Not even close.

211
00:09:55,342 --> 00:09:57,719
What are you talking about?
This piece of crap looks great.

212
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,055
You guys suck.

213
00:10:00,139 --> 00:10:01,974
- I'm gonna call Mondo.
-  Here we go.

214
00:10:02,057 --> 00:10:03,559
"Perfect Mondo."

215
00:10:03,642 --> 00:10:06,562
- Come on. Why do you gotta call him?
- Because he's her favorite.

216
00:10:06,645 --> 00:10:08,063
He's not my favorite.

217
00:10:08,897 --> 00:10:11,900
I mean, he is the nicest, and the wisest,

218
00:10:11,984 --> 00:10:15,404
and if all of you were drowning,
I would choose to save him.

219
00:10:15,487 --> 00:10:17,781
Oh, I guess he is my favorite.
How about that?

220
00:10:17,865 --> 00:10:21,201
Anyway, he understands things like this.
And you two don't.

221
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:25,497
We need to figure this out
- before Mondo gets here.
- Yeah.

222
00:10:25,581 --> 00:10:28,250
I'm so sick of losing
to that kombucha-sipping freak.

223
00:10:28,333 --> 00:10:31,336
Actually, uh, Mondo put me
on a kombucha regimen,

224
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:35,799
and let me tell you,
my gut health is through the roof.

225
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:39,678
How's your gut health now, dummy?

226
00:10:44,099 --> 00:10:47,102
Well, this sucks.
What do we do now?

227
00:10:47,186 --> 00:10:48,604
We can watch Harris.

228
00:10:48,687 --> 00:10:51,732
Sometimes when he gets rejected
really hard, he cries into his unicorn.

229
00:10:51,815 --> 00:10:53,358
Oh, hang on a second.

230
00:10:53,442 --> 00:10:54,985
That doesn't seem like much fun.

231
00:10:55,068 --> 00:10:57,112
I promise you it is.

232
00:10:57,196 --> 00:11:00,199
I don't know. There's gotta be a way
that we can get your money back.

233
00:11:03,202 --> 00:11:05,537
Yes. Hold on one second.

234
00:11:06,622 --> 00:11:10,000
- Uncle Rollie. Great.
- Hey, what's up, Primo?

235
00:11:10,083 --> 00:11:12,753
Some freaking kid
ran off with Mya's money.

236
00:11:12,836 --> 00:11:14,296
I need you to find him
and take care of it.

237
00:11:14,379 --> 00:11:15,631
"Take care of it?"

238
00:11:15,714 --> 00:11:17,966
Yeah, yeah.
Just, I don't know, uh, scare him.

239
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:19,301
Wave your trash thingy at him.

240
00:11:19,384 --> 00:11:20,636
Oh, like a shakedown?

241
00:11:20,719 --> 00:11:22,846
Yes. Exactly. Awesome.

242
00:11:22,930 --> 00:11:25,641
I already told them about how Uncle Mike
and I bailed you out this morning

243
00:11:25,724 --> 00:11:28,518
after you beat up that one guy,
and now they get to see it in real life.

244
00:11:29,603 --> 00:11:30,729
Hey, actually, Primo.

245
00:11:33,065 --> 00:11:36,777
Hey, I wish I could help you out,
but fighting isn't really my department.

246
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:39,363
What? This is exactly your department.

247
00:11:39,446 --> 00:11:41,823
You're the employee of the month
in this department.

248
00:11:41,907 --> 00:11:45,327
Look, Primo. I can't do it.
And plus I'm working.

249
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:46,954
You know what? Get out of here. Beat it.

250
00:11:47,037 --> 00:11:48,830
- Go.
- Now you're waving the stick at me?

251
00:11:56,421 --> 00:11:59,424
Where's your uncle? Is he gonna help?

252
00:11:59,508 --> 00:12:01,093
No, he's not.

253
00:12:02,219 --> 00:12:03,804
We're on our own.

254
00:12:03,887 --> 00:12:05,264
Guys, it's fine. Go have fun.

255
00:12:05,347 --> 00:12:07,266
I'll just go home.
I don't care about the money.

256
00:12:07,349 --> 00:12:09,476
No. No. Don't, don't leave.

257
00:12:09,559 --> 00:12:13,105
What if, what if we find the kid?
I mean, me and Harris can go this way,

258
00:12:13,188 --> 00:12:15,148
you two go the other way.
We'll run into him.

259
00:12:15,232 --> 00:12:20,112
Or you and Mya go that way,
and Harris and I go the other way.

260
00:12:20,195 --> 00:12:22,447
We're already partnered up by sides.
It doesn't make any sense.

261
00:12:22,531 --> 00:12:24,199
We should just do my plan.
It's way better.

262
00:12:29,913 --> 00:12:33,417
Oh, oh, yeah, yeah.

263
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:34,543
Okay.

264
00:12:34,626 --> 00:12:37,212
Let's do that. Right?
Let's go catch this kid, girl.

265
00:12:38,588 --> 00:12:39,673
Or woman.

266
00:12:40,799 --> 00:12:43,135
'Cause girls who mature,
and get larger, are called women.

267
00:12:44,011 --> 00:12:45,762
That's the difference.

268
00:12:45,846 --> 00:12:48,932
That's the difference. Size and age.

269
00:12:49,933 --> 00:12:51,810
Saved it. Good work.

270
00:12:52,602 --> 00:12:54,062
Okay.

271
00:12:55,063 --> 00:12:56,148
Catch you guys later.

272
00:12:58,317 --> 00:13:00,193
- That was awful.
- Yeah, he's hopeless.

273
00:13:03,071 --> 00:13:04,948
Ha, you're too late, idiot.

274
00:13:05,032 --> 00:13:06,325
We already figured it out.

275
00:13:06,408 --> 00:13:08,368
Everything's arranged by color.

276
00:13:09,119 --> 00:13:12,080
You two are completely clueless.

277
00:13:12,164 --> 00:13:14,875
What are you talking about?
All the junk is back on the shelves,

278
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:16,793
and it looks great.
What else could she want?

279
00:13:16,877 --> 00:13:18,337
She wants you not to call it junk.

280
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:22,466
Also, do you know why Drea would save me,
if we were all drowning?

281
00:13:22,549 --> 00:13:23,759
She told you that?

282
00:13:23,842 --> 00:13:25,385
Because I pay attention to her.

283
00:13:26,136 --> 00:13:27,929
This isn't just some bookshelf.

284
00:13:28,013 --> 00:13:30,223
There's an order within the chaos,
gentlemen.

285
00:13:30,307 --> 00:13:32,225
And until you figure out
what that order is,

286
00:13:32,309 --> 00:13:33,643
Drea will never forgive you.

287
00:13:33,727 --> 00:13:35,270
All right, fine. What's the order?

288
00:13:35,354 --> 00:13:38,565
Yeah. That's for you to figure out.
My job here is done.

289
00:13:38,648 --> 00:13:41,360
Also Arby's Beef 'N Cheddar
is three-for-five dollars today,

290
00:13:41,443 --> 00:13:44,821
so I have to get over there.
Also, can I borrow five dollars?

291
00:13:54,915 --> 00:13:58,001
Okay. After this is over,

292
00:13:58,085 --> 00:13:59,252
I'm not fighting you.

293
00:13:59,336 --> 00:14:00,879
You and me are fighting him.

294
00:14:00,962 --> 00:14:04,049
One hundo p.

295
00:14:04,132 --> 00:14:05,342
A hundred percent?

296
00:14:06,218 --> 00:14:08,637
Oh, again.

297
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,181
- Say full words.
-  Uh-hmm.

298
00:14:23,276 --> 00:14:25,946
This is pointless.
We're never gonna find this kid.

299
00:14:26,029 --> 00:14:30,659
Yo.
What's with the unicorn?

300
00:14:30,742 --> 00:14:34,996
Oh, yeah.
I just won it at the ring toss.

301
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:37,916
I forgot I had this
because I win all the things,

302
00:14:37,999 --> 00:14:39,960
all the time. So...

303
00:14:40,043 --> 00:14:43,630
They actually don't have unicorns
this year. They have sloths.

304
00:14:45,132 --> 00:14:48,844
What kind of creep walks around
with a raggedy
old unicorn in his backpack?

305
00:14:48,927 --> 00:14:50,137
He does.

306
00:14:52,389 --> 00:14:55,517
His name's Harris.
He also has candy in his backpack.

307
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,019
You see? It is better than any ride.

308
00:14:58,687 --> 00:15:00,313
Come on, man, you ruined it.

309
00:15:00,397 --> 00:15:02,023
Oh, yeah, I ruined it.

310
00:15:02,732 --> 00:15:05,026
So, this is kind of fun, right?

311
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:07,279
It's like we're the two guys
in  Lord of the Rings.

312
00:15:07,362 --> 00:15:09,614
Kind of. I mean,
they had the ring the whole time.

313
00:15:11,074 --> 00:15:13,618
I got bored halfway through
and stopped watching it.

314
00:15:13,702 --> 00:15:15,912
Like, why didn't the wizard
just summon a giant eagle

315
00:15:15,996 --> 00:15:17,873
and fly the ring straight
into the volcano, you know?

316
00:15:17,956 --> 00:15:20,250
That actually happens in the last movie.

317
00:15:20,333 --> 00:15:23,044
See? I could've saved them so much time.

318
00:15:26,715 --> 00:15:29,593
Why don't, why, why don't we get
on the carousel?

319
00:15:30,594 --> 00:15:33,096
We might be able to get a better 360 view.

320
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:35,265
No. The line is too long.
It'll take forever.

321
00:15:35,348 --> 00:15:38,226
How about you jump on that bench
and see if you can see anything?

322
00:15:41,855 --> 00:15:44,357
I think we should probably stay
right here in the middle,

323
00:15:44,441 --> 00:15:46,860
where it's nice and cool. Keep looking.

324
00:15:48,904 --> 00:15:52,866
Oh, my God. He's right there.

325
00:15:52,949 --> 00:15:54,451
Hey. Hey, yo, kid!

326
00:15:55,452 --> 00:15:56,870
You owe her $20!

327
00:16:01,333 --> 00:16:04,169
Damn, this shirt is amazing! Come on!

328
00:16:07,172 --> 00:16:10,759
Here we go.
I found a picture with the bookshelf
in the background.

329
00:16:11,927 --> 00:16:14,888
- Who's that?
- Oh, that's Maggie. Yeah.

330
00:16:14,971 --> 00:16:16,806
She came into the bank
and asked for the manager,

331
00:16:16,890 --> 00:16:20,435
so then I just pretended
to be the manager,
and then we dated for a month.

332
00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:23,844
But then, she found out
I wasn't the manager,
and then we broke up.

333
00:16:23,844 --> 00:16:25,690
And then,
she talked to the actual manager.

334
00:16:25,774 --> 00:16:29,945
And now, they're married.
Oh, that's Maggie for you.

335
00:16:30,028 --> 00:16:34,115
All right.
That blue book goes on the top shelf.

336
00:16:39,287 --> 00:16:42,040
"Dear Drea, thank you
for taking me to choir practice.

337
00:16:42,123 --> 00:16:45,961
I love church and I love you, Rollie."
Aww.

338
00:16:46,044 --> 00:16:47,587
I forgot he used to sing.

339
00:16:48,505 --> 00:16:49,881
Why does she still have that?

340
00:16:49,965 --> 00:16:52,050
Well, you know Drea, she saves everything.

341
00:16:53,552 --> 00:16:55,345
She saves everything.

342
00:16:56,304 --> 00:16:58,723
Look, I lost my first tooth!

343
00:16:58,807 --> 00:17:00,684
Congrats, Ryan!

344
00:17:01,935 --> 00:17:03,853
I made this in shop.

345
00:17:04,938 --> 00:17:07,232
I love it!

346
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:10,735
What happened to you?

347
00:17:10,819 --> 00:17:12,529
Marco called you a thing I didn't like,

348
00:17:12,612 --> 00:17:15,156
so I knocked his tooth out
and I brought it to you.

349
00:17:21,621 --> 00:17:25,125
Each of these shelves is for one of us.

350
00:17:25,208 --> 00:17:27,377
She's been saving everything,
our whole lives.

351
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:28,587
Took you long enough.

352
00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:31,923
I mean, you've walked
by that shelf a million times

353
00:17:32,007 --> 00:17:33,800
and you never thought to look at it?

354
00:17:35,302 --> 00:17:36,636
Men are so stupid.

355
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,638
- Where'd you come from?
- Arby's.

356
00:17:38,722 --> 00:17:40,390
Where are our sandwiches?

357
00:17:40,473 --> 00:17:41,641
"Your" sandwiches?

358
00:17:41,725 --> 00:17:44,394
Yeah. It was a three-for-five deal.
I gave you the money.

359
00:17:44,477 --> 00:17:46,396
We thought you were getting
each of us a sandwich!

360
00:17:46,479 --> 00:17:49,441
Hmm, guys, let's not get caught up
on "who gave who money,"

361
00:17:49,524 --> 00:17:51,818
or "who ate all three sandwiches
by himself."

362
00:17:51,901 --> 00:17:55,655
The point is,
this shelf represents our lives,

363
00:17:55,739 --> 00:17:57,866
rendered in objects.

364
00:17:57,949 --> 00:18:00,827
And the fact that you didn't know
that is embarrassing for you,

365
00:18:00,910 --> 00:18:03,705
and hurtful to Drea.

366
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:10,754
I made this in like seventh grade
and she saved it.

367
00:18:10,837 --> 00:18:14,132
- What is it?
- I don't know.

368
00:18:14,215 --> 00:18:15,675
It kinda looks like a robot turd.

369
00:18:15,759 --> 00:18:18,970
We're so ugly, and she loves us anyway.

370
00:18:20,639 --> 00:18:22,432
Just like this robot turd.

371
00:18:25,935 --> 00:18:28,521
- Hey! You stole our money!
- No, I didn't, I found it.

372
00:18:28,605 --> 00:18:30,899
- Then hand it over.
- No.

373
00:18:32,484 --> 00:18:33,693
Yes.

374
00:18:34,986 --> 00:18:37,822
What the hell
is that shirt made out of, eel skin?

375
00:18:39,115 --> 00:18:42,494
Fight! Fight!
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!

376
00:18:45,121 --> 00:18:46,498
Give it back!

377
00:18:46,581 --> 00:18:48,667
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!

378
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:50,710
Oh, damn. Primo! Sh...

379
00:18:51,753 --> 00:18:56,716
Oh! Whoa! Hey!
Put me down! Put me down!

380
00:19:02,472 --> 00:19:04,140
Well, this was fun.

381
00:19:10,271 --> 00:19:14,526
Ladies and gentlemen,
the park will be closing in 15 minutes.

382
00:19:16,986 --> 00:19:18,697
You okay?

383
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:20,532
Now you wanna talk?

384
00:19:20,615 --> 00:19:22,742
Because earlier I asked you for help,

385
00:19:22,826 --> 00:19:24,202
and you left me hanging.

386
00:19:24,285 --> 00:19:26,788
And then, you actually picked me up
in front of everyone.

387
00:19:26,871 --> 00:19:29,749
And, and you actually left me hanging.

388
00:19:31,668 --> 00:19:33,712
Are you seriously
laughing at me right now?

389
00:19:33,795 --> 00:19:35,755
Hey, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, all right?

390
00:19:35,839 --> 00:19:38,341
It's just that...
that there's this clown, like,

391
00:19:38,425 --> 00:19:41,970
right behind you and he's got
the same exact outfit as you.

392
00:19:42,762 --> 00:19:44,305
Come on.

393
00:19:44,389 --> 00:19:45,765
Hey. My bad, my bad.

394
00:19:45,849 --> 00:19:49,102
Hey, just switch places with me,
so I don't got to look at it. Come on.

395
00:19:54,065 --> 00:19:56,985
Great. Now I have to look at it.

396
00:19:57,068 --> 00:20:00,196
Hey, look.
You don't understand the code.

397
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:02,240
Now, just because you had a bad night,

398
00:20:02,323 --> 00:20:04,909
it doesn't mean you grab some kid
and beat the crap out of him.

399
00:20:04,993 --> 00:20:09,122
He stole Mya's money,
and he ruined my best chance,

400
00:20:09,205 --> 00:20:12,250
my only chance to have fun with her
at the carnival.

401
00:20:13,126 --> 00:20:17,088
It's like... I mean, I don't know.
What else was I supposed to do?

402
00:20:17,172 --> 00:20:21,843
All right, look, Primo.
Fighting is my way to solve a problem.

403
00:20:21,926 --> 00:20:24,429
And yes, it does make me,
like, extremely cool,

404
00:20:25,096 --> 00:20:26,890
but it doesn't have to be your way.

405
00:20:28,933 --> 00:20:30,101
Hey, you know what?

406
00:20:31,311 --> 00:20:33,646
Hey, call your little girlfriend back.

407
00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:36,399
And you guys meet me
at the back gate in 30 minutes.

408
00:20:36,483 --> 00:20:38,818
Why? This place is gonna be closed.

409
00:20:38,902 --> 00:20:41,654
I have a plan. Look for my signal.

410
00:20:45,825 --> 00:20:47,160
Wait. What signal?

411
00:20:47,243 --> 00:20:50,205
You're making a big reveal
out of fixing something you broke?

412
00:20:50,288 --> 00:20:51,498
That's rich.

413
00:20:52,791 --> 00:20:54,667
Open your eyes.

414
00:20:58,046 --> 00:21:02,050
Oh, my goodness.
Look how beautiful.

415
00:21:02,133 --> 00:21:06,179
And you got everything back the right way.
And you added that little light.

416
00:21:06,262 --> 00:21:09,808
But here's the best part. This...
is the Drea shelf,

417
00:21:09,891 --> 00:21:13,228
for all your precious keepsakes
that matter to us.

418
00:21:13,311 --> 00:21:15,396
You boys.

419
00:21:16,314 --> 00:21:17,524
Is that my charger?

420
00:21:17,607 --> 00:21:19,859
Yeah, we didn't really have
anything good yet,

421
00:21:19,943 --> 00:21:21,611
but we'll find some better stuff soon.

422
00:21:21,694 --> 00:21:24,239
Also, there was a lot
of human teeth on there.

423
00:21:24,322 --> 00:21:26,825
We threw those away, because that's gross.

424
00:21:26,908 --> 00:21:29,702
Okay. Well, I love it and it's wonderful.
Thank you.

425
00:21:31,704 --> 00:21:33,998
You, you did it again?

426
00:21:34,082 --> 00:21:35,542
- Goddamn it!
- Oh, come on.

427
00:21:35,625 --> 00:21:37,669
So glad you like it.

428
00:21:37,752 --> 00:21:40,380
I can always count on you, you know?

429
00:21:41,798 --> 00:21:44,759
- What are we waiting for?
- I don't know.

430
00:21:44,843 --> 00:21:47,303
He said to come out here
and that we were to see something.

431
00:21:47,387 --> 00:21:49,514
What is that?

432
00:21:52,517 --> 00:21:54,394
The Mexican Bat-Signal.

433
00:21:54,477 --> 00:21:56,855
- Brown Knight rises!
- That seems racist.

434
00:21:56,938 --> 00:21:59,232
Harris is Filipino, it's close enough.

435
00:21:59,315 --> 00:22:03,570
Psst. Hey. Come on. Let's go.
Come on. Hurry up.

436
00:22:07,991 --> 00:22:10,118
I broke curfew for this?

437
00:22:10,201 --> 00:22:11,953
What's going on, Uncle Rollie?

438
00:22:12,036 --> 00:22:15,957
You guys
got the place all to yourselves.

439
00:22:27,176 --> 00:22:28,678
Damn, I'm like the king of the park.

440
00:22:28,761 --> 00:22:30,263
I wish there was some girls here
to see me.

441
00:22:30,346 --> 00:22:33,474
Well, let's go! Come on!

442
00:22:40,356 --> 00:22:43,067
- What the hell, man?
- Hey, what's up, Chris?

443
00:22:43,151 --> 00:22:45,278
You know I did you a favor
by bringing you on, right?

444
00:22:45,361 --> 00:22:49,657
Yeah, look.
Look, here's the money
back from my shift, all right?

445
00:22:49,741 --> 00:22:53,161
They had a rough night.
Hey, hey, do me a favor,

446
00:22:53,244 --> 00:22:56,414
give them like 40 minutes
before you call the cops, all right?

447
00:22:56,497 --> 00:23:00,084
Man, if I had an uncle like you,

448
00:23:00,168 --> 00:23:02,128
my life might've turned out differently.

449
00:23:02,211 --> 00:23:03,504
Probably not.

450
00:23:11,304 --> 00:23:12,972
Oh, it's the photo booth! Come on!

451
00:23:13,056 --> 00:23:15,016
All right. All right. All right.

452
00:23:22,398 --> 00:23:25,777
Uh-oh. They're coming out.
Let's see. What was that?

453
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:28,988
Goofball.

454
00:23:41,626 --> 00:23:44,253
Hey. What is going on? Where is Primo?

455
00:23:44,337 --> 00:23:47,507
Hey, just relax.
They're fine.

456
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:49,592
Hey, hey,
why don't you ride the Gravitron,

457
00:23:49,676 --> 00:23:52,345
since you're not tall enough to ride it
during regular business hours.

458
00:23:55,223 --> 00:23:57,642
- Great job.

459
00:23:57,725 --> 00:23:59,519
- No! What the...

460
00:23:59,602 --> 00:24:01,938
That's Uncle Rollie's
"The cops are coming" whistle.

461
00:24:02,021 --> 00:24:03,356
We gotta go.

462
00:24:11,114 --> 00:24:13,408
Let me handle this.

463
00:24:13,491 --> 00:24:16,285
No. Let me handle this. I'm in the Army.
They are law enforcement.

464
00:24:16,369 --> 00:24:19,956
There's a mutual respect there.
Just let me do the talking.

465
00:24:20,039 --> 00:24:21,332
What's going on here?

466
00:24:21,416 --> 00:24:23,793
Good evening, ma'am, sir.

467
00:24:23,876 --> 00:24:26,087
Mike Gonzalez,
U.S. Army Recruitment Office.

468
00:24:26,170 --> 00:24:27,922
Let me explain to you
what's happening here.

469
00:24:28,006 --> 00:24:31,134
Do you remember when Halle Berry
was married to David Justice?

470
00:24:34,846 --> 00:24:37,306
Hey, Rollie, I'm halfway through.

471
00:24:37,390 --> 00:24:39,559
Aye, nice work, bro.

472
00:24:39,642 --> 00:24:42,395
No, it's not.
Every one of those is wrong.

473
00:24:42,478 --> 00:24:44,564
He's just writing
different types of weapons.

474
00:24:44,647 --> 00:24:48,149
Hey. We measure effort, Mike, not results.

475
00:24:48,149 --> 00:24:50,389
Hey, good job, Viper.

476
00:24:51,195 --> 00:24:54,449
- Don't touch me.
- Okay.

477
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:02,623
You gonna be in trouble?

478
00:25:02,707 --> 00:25:06,586
Well, I'm an hour late past my curfew,
so, yeah, I'm pretty much dead.

479
00:25:06,669 --> 00:25:08,755
I'm sorry everything got so crazy.

480
00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:28,316
What was that for?

481
00:25:28,399 --> 00:25:31,110
Tonight was the most fun I've had
since I moved here.

482
00:25:32,779 --> 00:25:35,493
And that's my mom. Or my dad.

483
00:25:35,493 --> 00:25:37,644
Either way, you should probably run.

484
00:25:38,451 --> 00:25:40,661
Now. Go.

485
00:25:45,166 --> 00:25:46,375
Yes!

486
00:25:55,167 --> 00:25:58,746
Nine

487
00:25:58,746 --> 00:26:00,014
What do you think?

488
00:26:06,479 --> 00:26:07,688
You were right.

489
00:26:08,981 --> 00:26:10,566
I look dope.
