1
00:00:01,544 --> 00:00:05,381
{\an8}All right. Classifieds for Mom.

2
00:00:05,464 --> 00:00:07,550
Financial section for Uncle Ryan,

3
00:00:08,008 --> 00:00:09,552
Crosswords for Uncle Rollie.

4
00:00:10,511 --> 00:00:11,637
Where's Uncle Rollie?

5
00:00:11,721 --> 00:00:12,555
I don't know.

6
00:00:13,973 --> 00:00:15,516
Obituaries for Uncle Mike,

7
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:17,893
so he can see
if any of his enemies have died.

8
00:00:17,977 --> 00:00:19,645
Come on, Richard Soto.

9
00:00:19,729 --> 00:00:21,313
- What'd he do to you?
- I don't remember.

10
00:00:21,397 --> 00:00:22,857
I just know that I want him dead.

11
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:27,069
Uncle Mondo gets the horoscopes,
and everything else for Uncle Jay,

12
00:00:27,153 --> 00:00:28,779
so he can throw it all in the trash

13
00:00:28,863 --> 00:00:31,240
'cause he's still mad
about the typo in his ad last year.

14
00:00:31,323 --> 00:00:34,577
I was very clear.
"Hose." H-O-S-E.

15
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:38,247
We're an irrigation company.
That kind of "hose." Not the other kind.

16
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:41,333
- Rollie's in jail.

17
00:00:41,417 --> 00:00:42,877
He needs to be bailed out again.

18
00:00:45,212 --> 00:00:47,673
- Mike.
- Damn it.

19
00:00:48,883 --> 00:00:52,303
Mondo, I'll do your laundry
if you go pick up Rollie for me.

20
00:00:52,386 --> 00:00:53,721
Hmm. Deal.

21
00:00:54,847 --> 00:00:56,182
Ryan, if you go get Rollie,

22
00:00:56,265 --> 00:00:58,517
I'll let you explain crypto to me
for 20 minutes.

23
00:00:58,601 --> 00:01:01,228
Deal. Smartest decision you've ever made.

24
00:01:01,312 --> 00:01:04,356
Jay, your daughter's still doing
a fundraiser for their dance recital

25
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:07,485
because I would now
love to make a donation?

26
00:01:07,568 --> 00:01:08,819
Deal.

27
00:01:08,903 --> 00:01:10,070
- Mike?
-  Hmm.

28
00:01:10,154 --> 00:01:11,280
If you go get Rollie,

29
00:01:11,363 --> 00:01:13,741
I won't tell anyone
about your secret Tinder profile.

30
00:01:13,824 --> 00:01:15,201
- Hmm.
- You know about that?

31
00:01:15,284 --> 00:01:17,077
I've been cat-fishing you for a month.

32
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:20,164
- You're "Jae?"
- I didn't even change my name.

33
00:01:20,247 --> 00:01:21,499
This is on you.

34
00:01:21,582 --> 00:01:24,418
And if you don't want everyone else
to see the screenshots I took...

35
00:01:27,505 --> 00:01:29,715
And here's my laundry.

36
00:01:30,466 --> 00:01:32,510
- Can you drop me at the school after?
- Sure.

37
00:01:32,593 --> 00:01:34,220
Does anybody else
have any more jobs I can do?

38
00:01:34,303 --> 00:01:35,721
- Oh, no, I'm good.
- You sure?

39
00:01:35,805 --> 00:01:37,473
-  Uh-hmm.
-  Great.

40
00:01:43,938 --> 00:01:46,357
You're gonna show us
the screenshots though, right?

41
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,566
Yes.

42
00:01:48,734 --> 00:01:50,402
Ahh.

43
00:01:59,161 --> 00:02:03,207
All right, guys.
Fifteen across, "Source of agony."

44
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:04,333
Eight letters.

45
00:02:05,876 --> 00:02:07,878
- Knife.
- That's five letters.

46
00:02:09,421 --> 00:02:10,506
Big knife.

47
00:02:12,174 --> 00:02:13,968
Try some non knife words.

48
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:16,095
-  Gonzales.
-  What's up?

49
00:02:17,388 --> 00:02:18,973
Your family bailed you out.

50
00:02:19,056 --> 00:02:22,476
All right, Viper.
Finish this off for me. I believe in you.

51
00:02:27,857 --> 00:02:29,650
Machetes.

52
00:02:30,442 --> 00:02:31,902
There's a lesson here, Primo.

53
00:02:31,986 --> 00:02:35,155
Yes, I was in jail.
But I did it for a good reason.

54
00:02:35,239 --> 00:02:37,616
Some idiot was trying to
dine and dash on a waitress,

55
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:39,201
so I had to knock him out.

56
00:02:39,285 --> 00:02:41,370
And I knew
it'd probably get me into trouble,

57
00:02:41,453 --> 00:02:43,581
but I did it
for the principle of the matter.

58
00:02:43,664 --> 00:02:46,458
You head-butted a guy
at a strip club buffet.

59
00:02:46,542 --> 00:02:48,586
Yeah. I did what I had to do
to right the wrong.

60
00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:51,380
Whoa, you're like Mexican Batman.

61
00:02:51,463 --> 00:02:53,215
- No.
-  Yeah, that's right.

62
00:02:53,299 --> 00:02:55,050
I'm a vigilante for justice.

63
00:02:55,134 --> 00:02:57,803
That's why I have
a tattoo of Lady Justice.

64
00:02:59,638 --> 00:03:01,015
Is that Halle Berry?

65
00:03:01,098 --> 00:03:02,308
Yeah.

66
00:03:02,391 --> 00:03:04,393
Yeah, she used to be married
to David Justice,

67
00:03:04,476 --> 00:03:06,353
so she was Lady Justice.

68
00:03:06,437 --> 00:03:08,439
- Oh.
- Do you see, Primo?

69
00:03:08,522 --> 00:03:10,733
I'm always sticking up for the little guy.

70
00:03:10,816 --> 00:03:12,192
Like your Uncle Mike.

71
00:03:12,276 --> 00:03:15,321
Look how little he is,
with his cute, tiny Lego body.

72
00:03:15,404 --> 00:03:17,907
Okay. Primo, go get the truck.

73
00:03:22,453 --> 00:03:25,331
Stop making yourself sound like a hero
in front of Primo.

74
00:03:25,414 --> 00:03:26,874
I could try, but it's kind of hard

75
00:03:26,957 --> 00:03:28,918
when you look like
a chiseled Marc Anthony.

76
00:03:29,001 --> 00:03:31,503
Rollie, you get locked up once a month.

77
00:03:31,587 --> 00:03:33,881
I didn't even have to say your name
when I walked in today.

78
00:03:33,964 --> 00:03:36,383
You are a regular. In jail.

79
00:03:37,301 --> 00:03:39,261
Primo looks up to you, man.

80
00:03:39,345 --> 00:03:42,473
Oh, I get it now.

81
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:45,142
You're just jealous
because he doesn't look up to you.

82
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:47,353
Because he can't, 'cause you're short.

83
00:03:47,436 --> 00:03:50,522
First of all, I'm taller than Tom Cruise,
People's Sexiest Man Alive in 1990.

84
00:03:50,606 --> 00:03:52,441
- Eh.
- Second of all,

85
00:03:52,524 --> 00:03:55,152
Primo might be able to go to college.

86
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:57,988
He has a chance to use his head,
and not as a weapon.

87
00:03:58,072 --> 00:04:01,367
So if he starts doing the dumb crap you do
'cause he thinks that's cool,

88
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:02,493
that's on you.

89
00:04:03,619 --> 00:04:05,704
Is that what you want for Primo?

90
00:04:10,459 --> 00:04:14,296
What? Your Uncle Rollie?
He's not Mexican Batman.

91
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:15,923
I thought Danny Trejo was Mexican Batman?

92
00:04:16,006 --> 00:04:17,091
I'm telling you, guys.

93
00:04:17,174 --> 00:04:20,719
He's kind of a playboy,
he only goes out at night and, uh--

94
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,554
dude, you know what?

95
00:04:22,638 --> 00:04:24,848
Now that I think about it,
he's been in a bunch of fights

96
00:04:24,932 --> 00:04:26,225
with a dude named "Joker."

97
00:04:26,308 --> 00:04:27,601
Isn't Batman a billionaire?

98
00:04:27,685 --> 00:04:30,437
Yeah. That's where the similarities end.

99
00:04:30,521 --> 00:04:32,648
He's working at the carnival tonight,
so we'll see him there.

100
00:04:32,731 --> 00:04:33,857
Wait, there's a carnival?

101
00:04:33,941 --> 00:04:35,442
Yeah.
Well, it's like a seasonal thing.

102
00:04:35,526 --> 00:04:37,653
And we go every year
the first weekend it opens up.

103
00:04:37,736 --> 00:04:38,779
And tonight's the first night.

104
00:04:38,862 --> 00:04:40,239
I love carnivals.

105
00:04:40,322 --> 00:04:42,408
When we lived in Germany,
there was one called Spargelfest.

106
00:04:42,491 --> 00:04:45,244
All the rides and attractions
were asparagus-themed.

107
00:04:48,372 --> 00:04:49,665
Do you have any cotton candy?

108
00:04:49,832 --> 00:04:50,708
No.

109
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:51,834
Only asparagus.

110
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:53,335
{\an8}Asparagus. Asparagus.

111
00:04:53,502 --> 00:04:54,545
Asparagus.

112
00:04:55,129 --> 00:04:56,046
Asparagus.

113
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,508
You should come with us tonight.
Unless you have plans.

114
00:04:59,591 --> 00:05:01,260
I was just gonna
hang out with my mom.

115
00:05:01,343 --> 00:05:03,721
On Friday night, she likes to drink
two glasses of white wine

116
00:05:03,804 --> 00:05:05,222
and watch  Remember the Titans.

117
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:09,143
But this sounds like more fun.

118
00:05:09,226 --> 00:05:11,562
- Hey, I'mma see you all tonight, okay?
- See ya.

119
00:05:14,857 --> 00:05:16,025
Dude.

120
00:05:16,108 --> 00:05:17,317
What?

121
00:05:20,946 --> 00:05:23,657
Oh, my God.
Mya's coming to the carnival with us.

122
00:05:23,741 --> 00:05:24,783
At night.

123
00:05:24,867 --> 00:05:26,618
You basically just asked her out.

124
00:05:26,702 --> 00:05:27,870
No, I didn't.

125
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:31,415
- I did?
- Yeah. This is big.

126
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:35,085
People make out at carnivals all the time.
I should know.

127
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:39,840
Awesome.

128
00:05:39,923 --> 00:05:42,134
Great time. Ugh.

129
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:48,182
Wait. But I mean,
she doesn't like me like that.

130
00:05:49,141 --> 00:05:50,267
Does she?

131
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,770
If she doesn't,
this is your chance to change that.

132
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:54,897
Rafa, the girl was excited
about asparagus.

133
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:57,357
Now, all you gotta do
is be more interesting than a vegetable.

134
00:05:57,441 --> 00:06:00,694
Yeah. I can do that.
I think I can do that.

135
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:04,323
I mean, asparagus is the most
dynamic vegetable, though.

136
00:06:04,406 --> 00:06:06,825
Like it starts out one way,
and then it gets complicated

137
00:06:06,909 --> 00:06:09,578
at the top in a way
that you just don't see coming.

138
00:06:10,537 --> 00:06:12,915
What's the second most dynamic vegetable?

139
00:06:12,998 --> 00:06:14,833
Tomatoes.
You can put it in meats and salads.

140
00:06:14,917 --> 00:06:17,086
- Tomato is a fruit, though.
- Yeah. Exactly.

141
00:06:17,169 --> 00:06:20,464
Another reason why it's one of
the most dynamic. It's unstoppable.

142
00:06:20,547 --> 00:06:22,299
It goes asparagus, tomato, cabbage.

143
00:06:22,966 --> 00:06:24,134
I'm not going tonight.

144
00:06:24,218 --> 00:06:26,386
Crows, pigeons, hawks?

145
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:27,846
Don't say another one.

146
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:29,765
What are you guys fighting about?

147
00:06:29,848 --> 00:06:31,225
- Give it a rest!
-  Owls.

148
00:06:36,146 --> 00:06:38,440
- What did you do?
- It's his fault.

149
00:06:38,524 --> 00:06:40,984
- He keeps saying birds don't get tired.
- They don't.

150
00:06:41,068 --> 00:06:42,861
Have you ever seen a bird
just be out of breath?

151
00:06:42,945 --> 00:06:44,780
Then why do they sleep,
if they don't get tired?

152
00:06:44,863 --> 00:06:46,573
-  Shut up!
- Enough.

153
00:06:47,825 --> 00:06:50,035
Fix this. Now.

154
00:06:50,119 --> 00:06:52,162
Relax. It's not a big deal.

155
00:06:52,246 --> 00:06:54,998
It's just an old bookshelf.
We'll get you a brand new one.

156
00:06:55,082 --> 00:06:58,627
I know a place that has great bookshelves.
And meatballs.

157
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:00,796
- Is it IKEA?
- It's IKEA.

158
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:03,715
I don't want a new bookshelf, Ryan.
I want this bookshelf.

159
00:07:03,799 --> 00:07:05,342
And I want it back the way it was.

160
00:07:08,011 --> 00:07:09,429
Sons of bitches!

161
00:07:10,472 --> 00:07:14,184
Birds just do this all day.
Big whoop.

162
00:07:15,978 --> 00:07:19,857
Oh, I feel it now. Birds are amazing.

163
00:07:25,154 --> 00:07:28,574
Hey. Thank you for letting me
borrow this outfit, Uncle Mike.

164
00:07:28,657 --> 00:07:29,658
I look sick as hell.

165
00:07:29,741 --> 00:07:30,993
Yeah, you do.

166
00:07:31,076 --> 00:07:33,537
The salesgirl at Express Men
said I looked "dope."

167
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:36,039
And salesgirls,
they have no reason to lie to you.

168
00:07:36,123 --> 00:07:39,334
This shirt is so slippery.
I feel like a sexy snake. Yeah.

169
00:07:39,418 --> 00:07:40,794
I'll pick you up at 11:00.

170
00:07:40,878 --> 00:07:43,255
- And steer clear of Uncle Rollie.
- Why?

171
00:07:43,338 --> 00:07:45,632
He's gonna be with his carney friends.
You know?

172
00:07:45,716 --> 00:07:47,593
Who knows what he'll go
bash his head into.

173
00:07:47,676 --> 00:07:50,137
- Okay.
- Oh, also, stay away from open flames.

174
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:52,181
Those pants will melt
right into your thighs.

175
00:07:52,723 --> 00:07:55,058
- Oh.
- Have fun.

176
00:07:55,142 --> 00:07:58,604
yeah [indistinct] every year.

177
00:07:58,687 --> 00:08:00,731
Yeah, that's right. That's right.

178
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:01,940
Anyway

179
00:08:02,024 --> 00:08:05,736
Dude, what are you wearing?
You look like a giant fishing lure.

180
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:08,197
Well, it can't be a date
if I don't dress like it's a date.

181
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,824
Which uncle did this?
Because this can't be all you.

182
00:08:10,908 --> 00:08:13,535
Uncle Mike. Y'all don't like it?

183
00:08:13,619 --> 00:08:15,954
She's 's gonna think
you're a divorced magician.

184
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:20,042
What's up, guys? Rafa, you look cool.

185
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:23,670
Thank you, Mya.
They're my uncle's clothes.

186
00:08:29,426 --> 00:08:30,802
Okay. Let's go.

187
00:08:36,892 --> 00:08:40,312
Hey, Dad. I'm here.
Yeah, I met up with my friends.

188
00:08:40,395 --> 00:08:42,689
I'll see you at 11:00?

189
00:08:42,773 --> 00:08:45,984
No, there's no boys here.
It's the first ever all-female carnival.

190
00:08:47,236 --> 00:08:49,947
Okay. See you at 10:30. Bye.

191
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:52,115
I thought you just said
your curfew was 11:00?

192
00:08:52,199 --> 00:08:54,284
Yeah, he docked me a half hour
'cause I mouthed off.

193
00:08:54,368 --> 00:08:55,369
My daddy don't play.

194
00:08:55,452 --> 00:08:57,663
So, what rides y'all wanna get on first?

195
00:08:57,746 --> 00:08:59,414
I don't waste time on those kiddie rides.

196
00:08:59,498 --> 00:09:02,000
I am here to meet girls,
and spend no money doing it.

197
00:09:02,084 --> 00:09:03,585
And how are you gonna pull that off?

198
00:09:03,669 --> 00:09:07,381
He packs his own popcorn and candy.
He hangs out by the carousel.

199
00:09:07,464 --> 00:09:08,757
It's a very romantic ride.

200
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,384
Then there's the closer.

201
00:09:11,343 --> 00:09:13,428
I won this baby three years ago,

202
00:09:13,512 --> 00:09:16,306
but I carry it around
so the ladies think I won it tonight.

203
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:18,141
- Hmm.
-  See, I don't go on any rides,

204
00:09:18,225 --> 00:09:19,393
because I have no money,

205
00:09:19,476 --> 00:09:22,187
so my entertainment is
watching Harris try and talk to girls.

206
00:09:22,271 --> 00:09:24,690
Because it never works.
And that's always funny.

207
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:27,776
Wait, wait, wait. Where's my money?

208
00:09:27,859 --> 00:09:30,153
It was in my pocket
and now it's not there.

209
00:09:30,237 --> 00:09:31,738
Shit.

210
00:09:31,822 --> 00:09:33,031
There it is.

211
00:09:36,952 --> 00:09:38,328
Hey! That's my money!

212
00:09:40,122 --> 00:09:41,248
Come on!

213
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:43,959
Harris! Hurry up!

214
00:09:44,042 --> 00:09:47,212
If I jostle the unicorn too hard,
the horn's gonna falls off!

215
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:52,175
We did it. Good as new.

216
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:55,429
No, it's not. Not even close.

217
00:09:55,512 --> 00:09:57,889
What are you talking about?
This piece of crap looks great.

218
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:00,225
You guys suck.

219
00:10:00,309 --> 00:10:02,144
- I'm gonna call Mondo.
-  Here we go.

220
00:10:02,227 --> 00:10:03,729
"Perfect Mondo."

221
00:10:03,812 --> 00:10:06,732
- Come on. Why do you gotta call him?
- Because he's her favorite.

222
00:10:06,815 --> 00:10:08,233
He's not my favorite.

223
00:10:09,067 --> 00:10:12,070
I mean, he is the nicest, and the wisest,

224
00:10:12,154 --> 00:10:15,574
and if all of you were drowning,
I would choose to save him.

225
00:10:15,657 --> 00:10:17,951
Oh, I guess he is my favorite.
How about that?

226
00:10:18,035 --> 00:10:21,371
Anyway, he understands things like this.
And you two don't.

227
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,291
We need to figure this out

228
00:10:24,374 --> 00:10:25,667
- before Mondo gets here.
- Yeah.

229
00:10:25,751 --> 00:10:28,420
I'm so sick of losing
to that kombucha-sipping freak.

230
00:10:28,503 --> 00:10:31,506
Actually, uh, Mondo put me
on a kombucha regimen,

231
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:35,969
and let me tell you,
my gut health is through the roof.

232
00:10:36,053 --> 00:10:38,096
Oh.

233
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:39,848
How's your gut health now, dummy?

234
00:10:44,269 --> 00:10:47,272
Well, this sucks.
What do we do now?

235
00:10:47,356 --> 00:10:48,774
We can watch Harris.

236
00:10:48,857 --> 00:10:51,902
Sometimes when he gets rejected
really hard, he cries into his unicorn.

237
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:53,528
Oh, hang on a second.

238
00:10:53,612 --> 00:10:55,155
That doesn't seem like much fun.

239
00:10:55,238 --> 00:10:57,282
I promise you it is.

240
00:10:57,366 --> 00:11:00,369
I don't know. There's gotta be a way
that we can get your money back.

241
00:11:03,372 --> 00:11:05,707
Yes. Hold on one second.

242
00:11:06,792 --> 00:11:10,170
- Uncle Rollie. Great.
- Hey, what's up, Primo?

243
00:11:10,253 --> 00:11:12,923
Some freaking kid
ran off with Mya's money.

244
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:14,466
I need you to find him
and take care of it.

245
00:11:14,549 --> 00:11:15,801
"Take care of it?"

246
00:11:15,884 --> 00:11:18,136
Yeah, yeah.
Just, I don't know, uh, scare him.

247
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:19,471
Wave your trash thingy at him.

248
00:11:19,554 --> 00:11:20,806
Oh, like a shakedown?

249
00:11:20,889 --> 00:11:23,016
Yes. Exactly. Awesome.

250
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:25,811
I already told them about how Uncle Mike
and I bailed you out this morning

251
00:11:25,894 --> 00:11:28,688
after you beat up that one guy,
and now they get to see it in real life.

252
00:11:29,773 --> 00:11:30,899
Hey, actually, Primo.

253
00:11:33,235 --> 00:11:36,947
Hey, I wish I could help you out,
but fighting isn't really my department.

254
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:39,533
What? This is exactly your department.

255
00:11:39,616 --> 00:11:41,993
You're the employee of the month
in this department.

256
00:11:42,077 --> 00:11:45,497
Look, Primo. I can't do it.
And plus I'm working.

257
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:47,124
You know what? Get out of here. Beat it.

258
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:49,000
- Go.
- Now you're waving the stick at me?

259
00:11:56,591 --> 00:11:59,594
Where's your uncle? Is he gonna help?

260
00:11:59,678 --> 00:12:01,263
No, he's not.

261
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:03,974
We're on our own.

262
00:12:04,057 --> 00:12:05,434
Guys, it's fine. Go have fun.

263
00:12:05,517 --> 00:12:07,436
I'll just go home.
I don't care about the money.

264
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:09,646
No. No. Don't, don't leave.

265
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:13,275
What if, what if we find the kid?
I mean, me and Harris can go this way,

266
00:12:13,358 --> 00:12:15,318
you two go the other way.
We'll run into him.

267
00:12:15,402 --> 00:12:20,282
Or you and Mya go that way,
and Harris and I go the other way.

268
00:12:20,365 --> 00:12:22,617
We're already partnered up by sides.
It doesn't make any sense.

269
00:12:22,701 --> 00:12:24,369
We should just do my plan.
It's way better.

270
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:33,587
Oh, oh, yeah, yeah.

271
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:34,713
Okay.

272
00:12:34,796 --> 00:12:37,382
Let's do that. Right?
Let's go catch this kid, girl.

273
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:39,843
Or woman.

274
00:12:40,969 --> 00:12:43,305
'Cause girls who mature,
and get larger, are called women.

275
00:12:44,181 --> 00:12:45,932
That's the difference.

276
00:12:46,016 --> 00:12:49,102
That's the difference. Size and age.

277
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:51,980
Saved it. Good work.

278
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:54,232
Okay.

279
00:12:55,233 --> 00:12:56,318
Catch you guys later.

280
00:12:58,487 --> 00:13:00,363
- That was awful.
- Yeah, he's hopeless.

281
00:13:03,241 --> 00:13:05,118
Ha, you're too late, idiot.

282
00:13:05,202 --> 00:13:06,495
We already figured it out.

283
00:13:06,578 --> 00:13:08,538
Everything's arranged by color.

284
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:12,250
You two are completely clueless.

285
00:13:12,334 --> 00:13:15,045
What are you talking about?
All the junk is back on the shelves,

286
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:16,963
and it looks great.
What else could she want?

287
00:13:17,047 --> 00:13:18,507
She wants you not to call it junk.

288
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:22,636
Also, do you know why Drea would save me,
if we were all drowning?

289
00:13:22,719 --> 00:13:23,929
She told you that?

290
00:13:24,012 --> 00:13:25,555
Because I pay attention to her.

291
00:13:26,306 --> 00:13:28,099
This isn't just some bookshelf.

292
00:13:28,183 --> 00:13:30,393
There's an order within the chaos,
gentlemen.

293
00:13:30,477 --> 00:13:32,395
And until you figure out
what that order is,

294
00:13:32,479 --> 00:13:33,813
Drea will never forgive you.

295
00:13:33,897 --> 00:13:35,440
All right, fine. What's the order?

296
00:13:35,524 --> 00:13:38,735
Yeah. That's for you to figure out.
My job here is done.

297
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:41,530
Also Arby's Beef 'N Cheddar
is three-for-five dollars today,

298
00:13:41,613 --> 00:13:44,991
so I have to get over there.
Also, can I borrow five dollars?

299
00:13:55,085 --> 00:13:58,171
Okay. After this is over,

300
00:13:58,255 --> 00:13:59,422
I'm not fighting you.

301
00:13:59,506 --> 00:14:01,049
You and me are fighting him.

302
00:14:01,132 --> 00:14:04,219
One hundo p.

303
00:14:04,302 --> 00:14:05,512
A hundred percent?

304
00:14:06,388 --> 00:14:08,807
Oh, again.

305
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:11,351
- Say full words.
-  Uh-hmm.

306
00:14:23,446 --> 00:14:26,116
This is pointless.
We're never gonna find this kid.

307
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:30,829
Yo.
What's with the unicorn?

308
00:14:30,912 --> 00:14:35,166
Oh, yeah.
I just won it at the ring toss.

309
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:38,086
I forgot I had this
because I win all the things,

310
00:14:38,169 --> 00:14:40,130
all the time. So...

311
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:43,800
They actually don't have unicorns
this year. They have sloths.

312
00:14:45,302 --> 00:14:47,387
What kind of creep walks around
with a raggedy

313
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:49,014
old unicorn in his backpack?

314
00:14:49,097 --> 00:14:50,307
He does.

315
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:55,687
His name's Harris.
He also has candy in his backpack.

316
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:58,189
You see? It is better than any ride.

317
00:14:58,857 --> 00:15:00,483
Come on, man, you ruined it.

318
00:15:00,567 --> 00:15:02,193
Oh, yeah, I ruined it.

319
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:05,196
So, this is kind of fun, right?

320
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:07,449
It's like we're the two guys
in  Lord of the Rings.

321
00:15:07,532 --> 00:15:09,784
Kind of. I mean,
they had the ring the whole time.

322
00:15:09,868 --> 00:15:11,161
Oh.

323
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:13,788
I got bored halfway through
and stopped watching it.

324
00:15:13,872 --> 00:15:16,082
Like, why didn't the wizard
just summon a giant eagle

325
00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:18,043
and fly the ring straight
into the volcano, you know?

326
00:15:18,126 --> 00:15:20,420
That actually happens in the last movie.

327
00:15:20,503 --> 00:15:23,214
See? I could've saved them so much time.

328
00:15:26,885 --> 00:15:29,763
Why don't, why, why don't we get
on the carousel?

329
00:15:30,764 --> 00:15:33,266
We might be able to get a better 360 view.

330
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:35,435
No. The line is too long.
It'll take forever.

331
00:15:35,518 --> 00:15:38,396
How about you jump on that bench
and see if you can see anything?

332
00:15:42,025 --> 00:15:44,527
I think we should probably stay
right here in the middle,

333
00:15:44,611 --> 00:15:47,030
where it's nice and cool. Keep looking.

334
00:15:49,074 --> 00:15:53,036
Oh, my God. He's right there.

335
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:54,621
Hey. Hey, yo, kid!

336
00:15:55,622 --> 00:15:57,040
You owe her $20!

337
00:16:01,503 --> 00:16:04,339
Damn, this shirt is amazing! Come on!

338
00:16:07,342 --> 00:16:08,551
Here we go.

339
00:16:08,635 --> 00:16:10,929
I found a picture with the bookshelf
in the background.

340
00:16:12,097 --> 00:16:13,765
Who's that?

341
00:16:13,848 --> 00:16:15,058
Oh, that's Maggie. Yeah.

342
00:16:15,141 --> 00:16:16,976
She came into the bank
and asked for the manager,

343
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:18,728
so then I just pretended
to be the manager,

344
00:16:18,812 --> 00:16:20,605
and then we dated for a month.

345
00:16:20,689 --> 00:16:22,732
But then, she found out
I wasn't the manager,

346
00:16:22,816 --> 00:16:25,860
and then we broke up. And then,
she talked to the actual manager.

347
00:16:25,944 --> 00:16:30,115
And now, they're married.
Oh, that's Maggie for you.

348
00:16:30,198 --> 00:16:34,285
All right.
That blue book goes on the top shelf.

349
00:16:39,457 --> 00:16:42,210
"Dear Drea, thank you
for taking me to choir practice.

350
00:16:42,293 --> 00:16:46,131
I love church and I love you, Rollie."
Aww.

351
00:16:46,214 --> 00:16:47,757
I forgot he used to sing.

352
00:16:48,675 --> 00:16:50,051
Why does she still have that?

353
00:16:50,135 --> 00:16:52,220
Well, you know Drea, she saves everything.

354
00:16:53,722 --> 00:16:55,515
She saves everything.

355
00:16:56,474 --> 00:16:58,893
Look, I lost my first tooth!

356
00:16:58,977 --> 00:17:00,854
Congrats, Ryan!

357
00:17:02,105 --> 00:17:04,023
I made this in shop.

358
00:17:05,108 --> 00:17:07,402
I love it!

359
00:17:09,529 --> 00:17:10,905
What happened to you?

360
00:17:10,989 --> 00:17:12,699
Marco called you a thing I didn't like,

361
00:17:12,782 --> 00:17:15,326
so I knocked his tooth out
and I brought it to you.

362
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:25,295
Each of these shelves is for one of us.

363
00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:27,547
She's been saving everything,
our whole lives.

364
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:28,757
Took you long enough.

365
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:32,093
I mean, you've walked
by that shelf a million times

366
00:17:32,177 --> 00:17:33,970
and you never thought to look at it?

367
00:17:35,472 --> 00:17:36,806
Men are so stupid.

368
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:38,808
- Where'd you come from?
- Arby's.

369
00:17:38,892 --> 00:17:40,560
Where are our sandwiches?

370
00:17:40,643 --> 00:17:41,811
"Your" sandwiches?

371
00:17:41,895 --> 00:17:44,564
Yeah. It was a three-for-five deal.
I gave you the money.

372
00:17:44,647 --> 00:17:46,566
We thought you were getting
each of us a sandwich!

373
00:17:46,649 --> 00:17:49,611
Hmm, guys, let's not get caught up
on "who gave who money,"

374
00:17:49,694 --> 00:17:51,988
or "who ate all three sandwiches
by himself."

375
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:55,825
The point is,
this shelf represents our lives,

376
00:17:55,909 --> 00:17:58,036
rendered in objects.

377
00:17:58,119 --> 00:18:00,997
And the fact that you didn't know
that is embarrassing for you,

378
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,875
and hurtful to Drea.

379
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:10,924
I made this in like seventh grade
and she saved it.

380
00:18:11,007 --> 00:18:12,467
What is it?

381
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:14,302
I don't know.

382
00:18:14,385 --> 00:18:15,845
It kinda looks like a robot turd.

383
00:18:15,929 --> 00:18:19,140
We're so ugly, and she loves us anyway.

384
00:18:20,809 --> 00:18:22,602
Just like this robot turd.

385
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:28,691
- Hey! You stole our money!
- No, I didn't, I found it.

386
00:18:28,775 --> 00:18:31,069
- Then hand it over.
- No.

387
00:18:32,654 --> 00:18:33,863
Yes.

388
00:18:35,156 --> 00:18:37,992
What the hell
is that shirt made out of, eel skin?

389
00:18:39,285 --> 00:18:42,664
Fight! Fight!
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!

390
00:18:42,747 --> 00:18:45,208
Hand it over! Give it back!

391
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:46,668
Give it back!

392
00:18:46,751 --> 00:18:48,837
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!

393
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,880
Oh, damn. Primo! Sh...

394
00:18:51,923 --> 00:18:56,886
Oh! Whoa! Hey!
Put me down! Put me down!

395
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:04,310
Well, this was fun.

396
00:19:10,441 --> 00:19:14,696
Ladies and gentlemen,
the park will be closing in 15 minutes.

397
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:18,867
You okay?

398
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:20,702
Now you wanna talk?

399
00:19:20,785 --> 00:19:22,912
Because earlier I asked you for help,

400
00:19:22,996 --> 00:19:24,372
and you left me hanging.

401
00:19:24,455 --> 00:19:26,958
And then, you actually picked me up
in front of everyone.

402
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:29,919
And, and you actually left me hanging.

403
00:19:31,838 --> 00:19:33,882
Are you seriously
laughing at me right now?

404
00:19:33,965 --> 00:19:35,925
Hey, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, all right?

405
00:19:36,009 --> 00:19:38,511
It's just that...
that there's this clown, like,

406
00:19:38,595 --> 00:19:42,140
right behind you and he's got
the same exact outfit as you.

407
00:19:42,932 --> 00:19:44,475
Come on.

408
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:45,935
Hey. My bad, my bad.

409
00:19:46,019 --> 00:19:49,272
Hey, just switch places with me,
so I don't got to look at it. Come on.

410
00:19:54,235 --> 00:19:57,155
Great. Now I have to look at it.

411
00:19:57,238 --> 00:20:00,366
Hey, look.
You don't understand the code.

412
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:02,410
Now, just because you had a bad night,

413
00:20:02,493 --> 00:20:05,079
it doesn't mean you grab some kid
and beat the crap out of him.

414
00:20:05,163 --> 00:20:09,292
He stole Mya's money,
and he ruined my best chance,

415
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:12,420
my only chance to have fun with her
at the carnival.

416
00:20:13,296 --> 00:20:17,258
It's like... I mean, I don't know.
What else was I supposed to do?

417
00:20:17,342 --> 00:20:22,013
All right, look, Primo.
Fighting is my way to solve a problem.

418
00:20:22,096 --> 00:20:24,599
And yes, it does make me,
like, extremely cool,

419
00:20:25,266 --> 00:20:27,060
but it doesn't have to be your way.

420
00:20:29,103 --> 00:20:30,271
Hey, you know what?

421
00:20:31,481 --> 00:20:33,816
Hey, call your little girlfriend back.

422
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:36,569
And you guys meet me
at the back gate in 30 minutes.

423
00:20:36,653 --> 00:20:38,988
Why? This place is gonna be closed.

424
00:20:39,072 --> 00:20:41,824
I have a plan. Look for my signal.

425
00:20:45,995 --> 00:20:47,330
Wait. What signal?

426
00:20:47,413 --> 00:20:50,375
You're making a big reveal
out of fixing something you broke?

427
00:20:50,458 --> 00:20:51,668
That's rich.

428
00:20:52,961 --> 00:20:54,837
Open your eyes.

429
00:20:58,216 --> 00:21:02,220
Oh, my goodness.
Look how beautiful.

430
00:21:02,303 --> 00:21:06,349
And you got everything back the right way.
And you added that little light.

431
00:21:06,432 --> 00:21:09,978
But here's the best part. This...
is the Drea shelf,

432
00:21:10,061 --> 00:21:13,398
for all your precious keepsakes
that matter to us.

433
00:21:13,481 --> 00:21:15,566
You boys.

434
00:21:16,484 --> 00:21:17,694
Is that my charger?

435
00:21:17,777 --> 00:21:20,029
Yeah, we didn't really have
anything good yet,

436
00:21:20,113 --> 00:21:21,781
but we'll find some better stuff soon.

437
00:21:21,864 --> 00:21:24,409
Also, there was a lot
of human teeth on there.

438
00:21:24,492 --> 00:21:26,995
We threw those away, because that's gross.

439
00:21:27,078 --> 00:21:29,872
Okay. Well, I love it and it's wonderful.
Thank you.

440
00:21:31,874 --> 00:21:34,168
You, you did it again?

441
00:21:34,252 --> 00:21:35,712
- Goddamn it!
- Oh, come on.

442
00:21:35,795 --> 00:21:37,839
So glad you like it.

443
00:21:37,922 --> 00:21:40,550
I can always count on you, you know?

444
00:21:41,968 --> 00:21:44,929
- What are we waiting for?
- I don't know.

445
00:21:45,013 --> 00:21:47,473
He said to come out here
and that we were to see something.

446
00:21:47,557 --> 00:21:49,684
What is that?

447
00:21:52,687 --> 00:21:54,564
The Mexican Bat-Signal.

448
00:21:54,647 --> 00:21:57,025
- Brown Knight rises!
- That seems racist.

449
00:21:57,108 --> 00:21:59,402
Harris is Filipino, it's close enough.

450
00:21:59,485 --> 00:22:03,740
Psst. Hey. Come on. Let's go.
Come on. Hurry up.

451
00:22:08,161 --> 00:22:10,288
I broke curfew for this?

452
00:22:10,371 --> 00:22:12,123
What's going on, Uncle Rollie?

453
00:22:12,206 --> 00:22:16,127
You guys
got the place all to yourselves.

454
00:22:25,636 --> 00:22:27,263
Yo!

455
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:28,848
Damn, I'm like the king of the park.

456
00:22:28,931 --> 00:22:30,433
I wish there was some girls here
to see me.

457
00:22:30,516 --> 00:22:33,644
Well, let's go! Come on!

458
00:22:40,526 --> 00:22:43,237
- What the hell, man?
- Hey, what's up, Chris?

459
00:22:43,321 --> 00:22:45,448
You know I did you a favor
by bringing you on, right?

460
00:22:45,531 --> 00:22:47,241
Yeah, look.

461
00:22:47,325 --> 00:22:49,827
Look, here's the money
back from my shift, all right?

462
00:22:49,911 --> 00:22:53,331
They had a rough night.
Hey, hey, do me a favor,

463
00:22:53,414 --> 00:22:56,584
give them like 40 minutes
before you call the cops, all right?

464
00:22:56,667 --> 00:23:00,254
Man, if I had an uncle like you,

465
00:23:00,338 --> 00:23:02,298
my life might've turned out differently.

466
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:03,674
Probably not.

467
00:23:11,474 --> 00:23:13,142
Oh, it's the photo booth! Come on!

468
00:23:13,226 --> 00:23:15,186
All right. All right. All right.

469
00:23:22,568 --> 00:23:25,947
Uh-oh. They're coming out.
Let's see. What was that?

470
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:29,158
Goofball.

471
00:23:41,796 --> 00:23:44,423
Hey. What is going on? Where is Primo?

472
00:23:44,507 --> 00:23:46,050
Hey, just relax.

473
00:23:46,134 --> 00:23:47,677
They're fine.

474
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,762
Hey, hey,
why don't you ride the Gravitron,

475
00:23:49,846 --> 00:23:52,515
since you're not tall enough to ride it
during regular business hours.

476
00:23:55,393 --> 00:23:57,812
- Great job.

477
00:23:57,895 --> 00:23:59,689
- No! What the...

478
00:23:59,772 --> 00:24:02,108
That's Uncle Rollie's
"The cops are coming" whistle.

479
00:24:02,191 --> 00:24:03,526
We gotta go.

480
00:24:11,284 --> 00:24:13,578
Let me handle this.

481
00:24:13,661 --> 00:24:16,455
No. Let me handle this. I'm in the Army.
They are law enforcement.

482
00:24:16,539 --> 00:24:20,126
There's a mutual respect there.
Just let me do the talking.

483
00:24:20,209 --> 00:24:21,502
What's going on here?

484
00:24:21,586 --> 00:24:23,963
Good evening, ma'am, sir.

485
00:24:24,046 --> 00:24:26,257
Mike Gonzalez,
U.S. Army Recruitment Office.

486
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:28,092
Let me explain to you
what's happening here.

487
00:24:28,176 --> 00:24:31,304
Do you remember when Halle Berry
was married to David Justice?

488
00:24:35,016 --> 00:24:37,476
Hey, Rollie, I'm halfway through.

489
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:39,729
Aye, nice work, bro.

490
00:24:39,812 --> 00:24:42,565
No, it's not.
Every one of those is wrong.

491
00:24:42,648 --> 00:24:44,734
He's just writing
different types of weapons.

492
00:24:44,817 --> 00:24:49,864
Hey. We measure effort, Mike, not results.
Hey, good job, Viper.

493
00:24:51,365 --> 00:24:53,409
Don't touch me.

494
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:54,619
Okay.

495
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:02,793
You gonna be in trouble?

496
00:25:02,877 --> 00:25:06,756
Well, I'm an hour late past my curfew,
so, yeah, I'm pretty much dead.

497
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:08,925
I'm sorry everything got so crazy.

498
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,486
What was that for?

499
00:25:28,569 --> 00:25:31,280
Tonight was the most fun I've had
since I moved here.

500
00:25:32,949 --> 00:25:37,328
And that's my mom. Or my dad.
Either way, you should probably run.

501
00:25:38,621 --> 00:25:40,831
Now. Go.

502
00:25:45,336 --> 00:25:46,545
Yes!

503
00:25:59,016 --> 00:26:00,184
What do you think?

504
00:26:06,649 --> 00:26:07,858
You were right.

505
00:26:09,151 --> 00:26:10,736
I look dope.

506
00:27:13,716 --> 00:27:15,468
Next on  Primo...

507
00:27:15,551 --> 00:27:17,094
Both of you, sit.

508
00:27:17,178 --> 00:27:18,596
Why'd you take that candy bar?

509
00:27:18,679 --> 00:27:21,390
{\an8}I decided what you did earned a spin
of the Punishment Wheel.

510
00:27:21,474 --> 00:27:23,768
Banks are scams. I like my money
in my house, where it's safe.

511
00:27:23,851 --> 00:27:25,686
You got robbed earlier today
by your nine-year-old daughter.

512
00:27:25,770 --> 00:27:27,563
Ah! They're hot!

513
00:27:27,646 --> 00:27:29,231
What if, and I know
this is highly unlikely...

514
00:27:29,315 --> 00:27:31,025
Jay, no movie-style bank heist

515
00:27:31,108 --> 00:27:33,861
is going to happen in this
regional San Antonio bank branch.
