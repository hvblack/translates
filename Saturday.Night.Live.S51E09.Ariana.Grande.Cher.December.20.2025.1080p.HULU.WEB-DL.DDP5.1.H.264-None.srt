1
00:00:02,403 --> 00:00:07,527
>> Announcer: AND NOW A HOLIDAY
MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT OF
THE UNITED STATES.

2
00:00:09,677 --> 00:00:11,398
HI

3
00:00:11,398 --> 00:00:13,360
>> HO, HO, HO, HO.

4
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:15,965
WE'VE ADDED A FOURTH HO.

5
00:00:15,966 --> 00:00:18,185
WAS THREE

6
00:00:18,185 --> 00:00:21,564
IT'S ME, YOUR FAVORITE
PRESIDENT.
BACK AGAIN THIS WEEK.

7
00:00:21,564 --> 00:00:24,292
COMING TO YOU LIVE FROM A PART
OF THE WHITE HOUSE

8
00:00:24,292 --> 00:00:27,619
THAT
MELANIA'S CHRISTMAS DECORATIONS
HAVEN'T GOTTEN TO YET.

9
00:00:27,619 --> 00:00:30,927
THAT'S WHY WE STILL HAVE
FIREPLACE AND GARLAND

10
00:00:30,927 --> 00:00:34,533
AND NOT
SPOOKY TWIGS IN BLACK VASE.

11
00:00:34,533 --> 00:00:37,927
BUT WE HAVE TO BE VIGILANT THIS
CHRISTMAS AS AMERICANS.

12
00:00:37,927 --> 00:00:41,311
AS YOU KNOW, ARCTIC
IMMIGRANTS ARE COMING IN OUR
CHIMNEYS,

13
00:00:41,311 --> 00:00:43,651
STEALING OUR MILK AND
COOKIES.

14
00:00:43,651 --> 00:00:45,634
I THINK THAT'S WHERE NORTH POLE
IS, ARCTIC.

15
00:00:45,634 --> 00:00:47,925
WE'RE GOING TO LOOK INTO THAT.

16
00:00:47,925 --> 00:00:52,179
WE LOVE CHRISTMAS, CROSS TO
TREE.

17
00:00:52,179 --> 00:00:56,215
I KNOW I'M NOT SUPPOSED TO SAY
THAT OUT LOUD, BUT IT HELPS ME
OKAY.

18
00:00:56,215 --> 00:00:58,592
WE LOVE TREE.

19
00:00:58,592 --> 00:01:01,572
REMEMBER WHEN I DID THIS WITH
FLAG?

20
00:01:01,572 --> 00:01:05,763
DID YOU LIKE THAT?
I'M HUGGING TREE NOW.
IT'S VERY SHARP.

21
00:01:05,763 --> 00:01:09,878
I HUG FLAG AND TREE, JUST NEVER
PERSON.
RETURN TO PODIUM.

22
00:01:09,878 --> 00:01:12,961
CHRISTMAS IS GREAT, WE LOVE IT.

23
00:01:12,961 --> 00:01:16,117
I'M DOING MY OWN VERSION OF NATIVITY,

24
00:01:16,117 --> 00:01:19,325
KINGS FROM THE MIDDLE
EAST BRING GIFTS FOR ME,

25
00:01:19,325 --> 00:01:24,244
LIKE
GOLD, AN AIRPLANE AND CASINO IN
DUBAI.

26
00:01:24,244 --> 00:01:27,939
BUT UNLIKE NATIVITY, THEY'RE NOT
SHOWING UP ON CAMEL.

27
00:01:27,939 --> 00:01:29,940
I KNOW CAMEL VERY WELL.

28
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:33,488
I KNOW IT FROM MY MANDATORY DAILY
COGNITIVE TEST.

29
00:01:33,488 --> 00:01:36,897
I ALWAYS POINT RIGHT TO CAMEL,
ALWAYS GET IT RIGHT.

30
00:01:36,897 --> 00:01:39,659
IT'S THE BUMPY HORSE.

31
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:41,958
CAMEL, BUMPY HORSE.
I SAY IT A LOT.

32
00:01:41,958 --> 00:01:44,545
BUT I WANTED TO RAMBLE TO YOU TONIGHT

33
00:01:44,545 --> 00:01:48,062
ABOUT THE INCREDIBLE
THINGS THIS ADMINISTRATION IS
DOING.

34
00:01:48,062 --> 00:01:49,758
WONDERFUL STUFF.

35
00:01:49,758 --> 00:01:53,545
WE ARE RENAMING THE KENNEDY
CENTER FOR THE PERFORMING ARTS,

36
00:01:53,545 --> 00:01:55,508
WHICH WILL NOW BE CALLED

37
00:01:55,508 --> 00:02:00,888
THE TRUMP-KENNEDY CENTER FOR THE
PERFORMING ARTS, NO HOMO.

38
00:02:01,787 --> 00:02:03,619
AND I'M ACTUALLY GOING TO BE

39
00:02:03,619 --> 00:02:07,894
RENAMING A NUMBER OF OUR OTHER
MONUMENTS AS WELL.

40
00:02:07,894 --> 00:02:11,159
TRUMP WASHINGTON MONUMENT.

41
00:02:12,008 --> 00:02:14,824
TRUMP LINCOLN MEMORIAL.

42
00:02:14,824 --> 00:02:19,488
AND OF COURSE -- BIG ELPHABA.

43
00:02:19,488 --> 00:02:22,903
THAT'S WAS JUST FOR FUN.
THE THIRD ONE IS ALWAYS THE
FUNNY ONE.

44
00:02:22,903 --> 00:02:27,901
YOU KNOW, PEOPLE ARE SAYING,
SIR, WHY
ARE YOU PUTTING YOUR NAME ON SO
MANY BUILDINGS,

45
00:02:27,901 --> 00:02:31,700
AND I SAY
BECAUSE WE HAD TO TAKE IT OFF SO
MANY FILES.

46
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:34,876
EPSTEIN, REDACTED.

47
00:02:34,876 --> 00:02:38,888
WE HAD SO MANY TRUMPS IN THERE,
HAD TO PUT THEM SOMEWHERE, YOU
KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

48
00:02:38,888 --> 00:02:40,826
WE LIKE TO SAY REDACTED.

49
00:02:40,826 --> 00:02:44,787
IT'S MY SECOND FAVORITE R-WORD,
REDACTED.

50
00:02:44,787 --> 00:02:47,161
SHUT UP.
LOVE IT.

51
00:02:47,161 --> 00:02:49,991
IT'S BEEN A GREAT YEAR FOR
FOREIGN POLICY.

52
00:02:49,991 --> 00:02:54,682
I AM INVADING VENEZUELA BY
MYSELF, STYLE.

53
00:02:54,682 --> 00:02:58,869
THAT'S EXCITING.
I THINK THAT HIT WITH SOME OF
THE LOSERS IN THE CROWD.
MAYBE IT DID.

54
00:02:58,869 --> 00:03:02,704
AND THE ECONOMIC IS FINE,

55
00:03:02,704 --> 00:03:05,518
CLOSER TO FINE.
INDIGO GIRLS.

56
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:09,405
THEY WERE ONE OF MY FAVORITE
LESBIAN FOLK ROCK DUOS,

57
00:03:09,405 --> 00:03:13,183
I
BELIEVE IT WAS MELISSA ETHERIDGE
AND ELTON JOHN.

58
00:03:13,183 --> 00:03:15,988
THEY WERE GREAT.

59
00:03:15,988 --> 00:03:18,527
AND THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT, I
ALMOST FORGOT,

60
00:03:18,527 --> 00:03:20,861
I'M INVENTING MY OWN HUNGER
GAMES.

61
00:03:20,861 --> 00:03:24,646
THAT'S RIGHT, THE WHITE HOUSE
WILL BE HOSTING PATRIOT GAMES

62
00:03:24,646 --> 00:03:26,893
FOR HIGH SCHOOL ATHLETES TO
COMPETE.

63
00:03:26,893 --> 00:03:31,718
BECAUSE I THOUGHT WHAT'S THE
BEST WAY TO DISTRACT FROM THE
EPSTEIN FILES?

64
00:03:31,718 --> 00:03:35,235
OH, I KNOW, INVITE A BUNCH OF
TEENAGERS TO MY HOUSE.

65
00:03:35,235 --> 00:03:36,788
THAT WILL HELP.

66
00:03:36,788 --> 00:03:40,814
I'LL TAKE "THINGS A PEDOPHILE
MIGHT DO" FOR A THOUSAND, ALEX.

67
00:03:40,814 --> 00:03:44,507
BUT YOU CAN'T SAY ALEX ANYMORE,
RIGHT, YOU GOT TO SAY KEN.

68
00:03:44,507 --> 00:03:46,972
GOT TO SAY KEN.
CAN'T SAY ALEX.

69
00:03:46,972 --> 00:03:49,497
AND IT WAS MIYAM BIALIK FOR A
WHILE.

70
00:03:49,497 --> 00:03:51,968
I LIKE KEN.

71
00:03:51,968 --> 00:03:55,517
THEY'RE SAYING, SIR, YOU'RE
DOING HUNGER GAMES

72
00:03:55,517 --> 00:03:56,710
AND YOU DON'T KNOW
HOW THE BOOK ENDS.

73
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:59,382
AND OF COURSE I DON'T BECAUSE
BOOK!

74
00:03:59,382 --> 00:04:03,280
I DON'T LIKE TO READ, AND
FRANKLY, MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO
ANYMORE.

75
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,071
WE'LL BE LOOKING INTO THAT
SHORTLY.

76
00:04:05,071 --> 00:04:08,274
BUT WITH REGARD TO FILES WE'RE
BEING VERY TRANSPARENT.

77
00:04:08,334 --> 00:04:10,702
BECAUSE JEFFREY
EPSTEIN WAS A TERRIBLE MAN

78
00:04:10,702 --> 00:04:12,936
AND I
DIDN'T KNOW HIM AND I LIKED HIM
A LOT.

79
00:04:12,936 --> 00:04:18,312
SO WE RELEASED ALL THE FILES AND
I CAME OUT LOOKING FRANKLY VERY
GOOD.

80
00:04:18,312 --> 00:04:21,676
WE HAD TO REDACT A FEW SENSITIVE
THINGS BUT YOU'LL GET THE GIST
HERE.

81
00:04:21,676 --> 00:04:23,461
LOOK AT THIS.

82
00:04:26,475 --> 00:04:27,904
CHECK IT OUT.

83
00:04:27,904 --> 00:04:31,635
TRUMP.
DIDN'T.
DO.
NOTHING.
BAD.

84
00:04:31,635 --> 00:04:33,595
TRUMP.
DOES.
SMASH.

85
00:04:33,595 --> 00:04:35,921
BUT.
NOT.
LIKE.
WRONG.
KIND.

86
00:04:35,921 --> 00:04:37,636
THE END.

87
00:04:37,636 --> 00:04:40,971
SEE, IT'S ALL THERE.
CAN YOU BELIEVE IT?

88
00:04:41,449 --> 00:04:46,107
IN CONCLUSION, IT'S BEEN A GREAT
SECOND FIRST YEAR.

89
00:04:46,107 --> 00:04:48,482
I WANT TO WISH EVERYONE A MERRY
CHRISTMAS

90
00:04:48,482 --> 00:04:51,380
OR IF YOU'RE JEWISH,
HAPPY HONKYTONK,

91
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:55,904
AND -- LIVE
FROM NEW YORK IT'S SATURDAY
NIGHT!

92
00:06:58,496 --> 00:07:02,922
MUSICAL

93
00:07:03,288 --> 00:07:08,396
HOST

94
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:16,137
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, ARIANA
GRANDE!

95
00:07:39,543 --> 00:07:42,182
THANK

96
00:07:42,182 --> 00:07:46,753
IT'S SO GOOD TO BE HERE TONIGHT
HOSTING THE CHRISTMAS EPISODE OF
SNL.

97
00:07:48,555 --> 00:07:50,878
THE LAST TIME I HOSTED WAS A YEAR AGO,

98
00:07:50,878 --> 00:07:54,460
AND PEOPLE HAVE BEEN
ASKING ME IF I'LL REVISIT SOME
OF MY SKETCHES FROM LAST TIME.

99
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:57,092
LIKE DOMINGO.

100
00:07:57,863 --> 00:08:00,543
BUT I TOLD THEM I DON'T THINK
SO.

101
00:08:00,543 --> 00:08:04,335
WHEN SOMETHING IS PERFECT, IT
DOESN'T NEED A SEQUEL.

102
00:08:04,591 --> 00:08:06,960
WHAT?

103
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:11,064
WHICH IS WHY I JUST FINISHED
FILMING "MEET THE PARENTS 4."

104
00:08:11,064 --> 00:08:13,835
DECEMBER IS MY FAVORITE TIME OF
YEAR IN NEW YORK.

105
00:08:13,835 --> 00:08:16,679
I LOVE THE DECORATIONS, THE SNOW
ON THE GROUND.

106
00:08:16,679 --> 00:08:19,001
I LOVE SHOPPING FOR
ALL MY LOVED ONES.

107
00:08:19,001 --> 00:08:21,718
BUT I HAVE TO ADMIT, I GET A
LITTLE STRESSED

108
00:08:21,718 --> 00:08:24,577
SHOPPING FOR
CERTAIN OTHER PEOPLE IN MY LIFE.

109
00:08:24,577 --> 00:08:27,208
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
MAYBE YOU CAN RELATE.

110
00:08:27,208 --> 00:08:29,531
OH, THANK YOU.

>> MARCELLO, WHAT IS IT?
>> I'LL TELL YOU.

162
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:03,026

THOUGHT.

163
00:12:03,026 --> 00:12:06,928
WHAT ELSE?

164
00:12:06,928 --> 00:12:10,191
>> MY COUSIN BROKE UP WITH

165
00:12:10,191 --> 00:12:15,667

WELL IN THAT CASE --

166
00:12:15,667 --> 00:12:24,708

00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:29,427
YOU ¶

WE HAVE GOT A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU

CHER IS HERE,

169
00:12:32,514 --> 00:12:35,668
SO STICK AROUND
AND WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

170
00:12:59,501 --> 00:13:03,297
CHILDREN ALL DAY

171
00:13:03,297 --> 00:13:05,708
TO SEE IF
THEY'RE NICE OR MEAN.

172
00:13:05,708 --> 00:13:11,062
AT NIGHT THEY FLY LIKE SANTA'S
SLEIGH AND TELL SANTA WHAT
THEY'VE SEEN.

173
00:13:11,062 --> 00:13:14,449
BUT THE JOB ISN'T ALWAYS JOLLY
EACH WINTER.

174
00:13:14,449 --> 00:13:17,224
IT CAN CAUSE THEIR BRIGHT
SPIRITS TO DROOP.

175
00:13:17,224 --> 00:13:19,813
SO AT THE NORTH POLE REC CENTER

176
00:13:19,813 --> 00:13:24,052
MEETS THE ELF ON THE SHELF
SUPPORT GROUP.

177
00:13:24,052 --> 00:13:28,666
>> OKAY, LOOKS LIKE THIS IS
EVERYONE.

178
00:13:28,666 --> 00:13:33,427
FOR OUR NEWCOMERS, HI, I'M
WAFFLES SILLYMUFFIN,

179
00:13:33,427 --> 00:13:38,248
AND I
RECEIVED A MASTERS IN
PSYCHOTHERAPY FROM PEPPERMINT.

180
00:13:38,248 --> 00:13:41,571
I PUT THIS GROUP TOGETHER TO
HELP US WORK THROUGH OUR TRAUMA.

181
00:13:41,571 --> 00:13:44,612
HAS ANYONE HAD A PARTICULARLY
ROUGH WEEK?

182
00:13:44,612 --> 00:13:47,755
>> YES.
LOOK WHAT THEY DID TO ME!

183
00:13:47,755 --> 00:13:51,654
MY HAT WAS FALLING OFF TOO MUCH
SO THEY STAPLED IT TO MY HEAD.

184
00:13:52,606 --> 00:13:57,019
>> MMM, THAT'S HARD.
BUT THAT'S WHY WE HAVE THIS
GROUP.
RIGHT?

185
00:13:57,019 --> 00:14:01,822
DEEDLEBEEP, WE HAVEN'T SEEN YOU
FOR A WHILE.
FEEL LIKE SHARING?

186
00:14:05,395 --> 00:14:08,176
>> NAH, MAN, NOT YET.

187
00:14:08,176 --> 00:14:10,321
>> THAT'S OKAY.
THAT'S OKAY.

188
00:14:10,321 --> 00:14:12,860
WE HAVE A NEW FACE.
HI THERE.

189
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:17,050
>> UH, HI.
I'M GIGGLEBOOPS.

190
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:21,000
AND THREE WEEKS AGO I FELL IN
BETWEEN THE COUCH CUSHIONS

191
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,819
AND
NOBODY'S FOUND ME.

192
00:14:22,819 --> 00:14:27,092
AND I'M GOING FRICKING CRAZY,
MAN.

193
00:14:27,092 --> 00:14:31,351
I'M TALKING TO A TRIPLE-A
BATTERY LIKE IT'S MY FRIEND,

194
00:14:31,351 --> 00:14:35,477
WHEN ARE THEY GONNA FIND ME?
WHEN ARE THEY GOING TO FIND
ME!

195
00:14:35,477 --> 00:14:39,017
>> HEY, HEY, HEY.
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.

196
00:14:39,017 --> 00:14:41,864
IT'S NOT.
YOUR FAULT.

197
00:14:41,864 --> 00:14:44,390
TWINKLEBUTTER?
WOULD YOU LIKE TO SHARE?

198
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:47,240
>> SURE.
HI.

199
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:49,771
I'M TWINKLEBUTTER.

200
00:14:49,771 --> 00:14:52,733
THE LITTLE GIRL THAT I'M
WATCHING IS AN ANGEL

201
00:14:52,733 --> 00:14:54,445
AND I LOVE
HER MORE THAN GUMDROPS.

202
00:14:54,445 --> 00:14:57,446
BUT THIS YEAR, THEY GOT A CAT.

203
00:14:57,446 --> 00:15:00,281
>> AND HOW ARE YOU GETTING ALONG
WITH THE CAT?

204
00:15:00,281 --> 00:15:02,541
>> BAD.

205
00:15:03,654 --> 00:15:08,047
AS YOU CAN SEE, IT RIPPED MY
ASS IN HALF.

206
00:15:08,047 --> 00:15:11,046
UM, IT HUNTS ME LIKE I'M A RAT.

207
00:15:11,046 --> 00:15:15,202
AND SINCE SANTA SAYS I CAN'T
MOVE
SANTA

208
00:15:15,202 --> 00:15:18,339
I HAVE TO LET IT
HAPPEN.

209
00:15:18,339 --> 00:15:21,857
I JUST WISH ELVES COULD DIE!

210
00:15:21,857 --> 00:15:24,244
WHY CAN'T WE DIE?

211
00:15:24,244 --> 00:15:26,943
SORRY, I'M GOING TO CRY.

212
00:15:26,943 --> 00:15:31,047
LET IT OUT.
LET IT ALL OUT.

213
00:15:31,047 --> 00:15:36,018
IT'S OKAY, GUYS.
THIS ISN'T SANTA'S WORKSHOP,
YOU'RE ALLOWED TO CRY HERE.

214
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:38,695
AND ACTUALLY ELVES CAN DIE.

215
00:15:38,695 --> 00:15:42,166
IF THEY THINK A NAUGHTY THOUGHT,
THEY EXPLODE INTO CONFETTI.

216
00:15:42,166 --> 00:15:46,399
>> HARD FOR ME NOT TO THINK
NAUGHTY THOUGHTS.

217
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:52,472
I'M ON A SHELF IN A FRAT HOUSE
AT ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY.

218
00:15:52,472 --> 00:15:57,344
AND THEY POSE ME IN WAYS THAT
AREN'T VERY JOLLY

219
00:15:57,344 --> 00:15:59,957
AND THEN TAKE
PICTURES.

220
00:15:59,957 --> 00:16:02,898
LIKE THIS ONE.

221
00:16:04,896 --> 00:16:09,550
AND ALSO THIS ONE.

222
00:16:09,837 --> 00:16:15,170
I EAT SUGAR WITH MY MOUTH, NOT
MY NOSE.

223
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:20,280
AND THEN THE WORST ONE, THIS.

224
00:16:21,853 --> 00:16:25,438
>> WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THAT
PICTURE, STICKYNUMMIES?

225
00:16:25,438 --> 00:16:28,152
>> I DON'T KNOW!

226
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:32,470
>> I THINK I KNOW WHAT'S
HAPPENING, AND I THINK I LIKE
IT.

227
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:35,976
>> NO, NO, ZIPPY, NO NO.

228
00:16:46,205 --> 00:16:49,698
IT'S FOR THE BEST.
HE WAS IN PAIN.

229
00:16:49,698 --> 00:16:52,245
DEEDLEBEEP, DO YOU WANT TO SHARE
NOW?

230
00:16:52,245 --> 00:16:54,937
>> NAH.
MISS ME WITH THAT.

231
00:16:54,937 --> 00:16:59,339
>> OKAY.
PICKLEFICKLE, I'M SURPRISED TO
SEE YOU HERE.

232
00:16:59,339 --> 00:17:01,389
I THOUGHT YOUR HOME WAS WARM AND
JOLLY.

233
00:17:01,389 --> 00:17:02,689
>> IT WAS.

234
00:17:02,689 --> 00:17:07,023
BUT THE OTHER DAY, THE GRANDPA
WAS ALONE IN THE HOUSE AND FELL.

235
00:17:07,023 --> 00:17:10,895
AND BECAUSE SANTA WON'T LET US
MOVE, I HAD TO SIT STILL

236
00:17:10,895 --> 00:17:14,654
AND
WATCH THIS POOR MAN MOAN FOR
HELP FOR NINE HOURS.

237
00:17:14,654 --> 00:17:17,740
WHILE MAKING THIS FACE!

238
00:17:18,972 --> 00:17:22,323
>> MAN, THAT AIN'T NOTHING!

239
00:17:22,323 --> 00:17:28,153
I GOT EATEN BY MY FAMILY'S BIG
OLD DUMB GUMABITCH DOG.

240
00:17:31,433 --> 00:17:34,808
TOOK MY DOWN IN ONE BITE.

241
00:17:34,808 --> 00:17:39,107
>> HOW'D YOU GET OUT?
>> HOW YOU THINK?

242
00:17:39,107 --> 00:17:41,862
I CAME OUT THE BACK DOOR.

243
00:17:41,862 --> 00:17:45,178
THE DOG PASSED ME OUT ITS
HERSHEY HOLE!

244
00:17:45,178 --> 00:17:48,338
WITH THE DOO-DOO!

245
00:17:48,854 --> 00:17:51,927
RIGHT IN THE BACKYARD

246
00:17:51,927 --> 00:17:56,379
WITH MY HAT SITTING ON TOP OF THE PILE.

247
00:17:56,379 --> 00:18:01,411
AND THAT GOT ME THINKING, MAN,
THAT SANTA, HEHE.

248
00:18:02,023 --> 00:18:05,655
>> OKAY, BE CAREFUL.
LET'S NOT HAVE ANY NAUGHTY
THOUGHTS, DEEDLEBEEP.

249
00:18:05,655 --> 00:18:08,695
>> TOO LATE BECAUSE I THINK SANTA IS --

250
00:18:08,778 --> 00:18:11,424
SANTA IS A
BUTT!

251
00:18:14,779 --> 00:18:17,787
>> OKAY, WELL LET'S CALL IT
THERE.

252
00:18:23,205 --> 00:18:24,967
TELEVISION.

253
00:18:24,968 --> 00:18:27,419
REGULAR

254
00:18:27,419 --> 00:18:28,846
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

255
00:18:28,846 --> 00:18:34,184
WE NOW RETURN TO THE
HEARTWARMING ENDING OF A
CHRISTMAS CLASSIC "HOME ALONE."

256
00:18:38,068 --> 00:18:40,441
>> KEVIN?

257
00:18:40,842 --> 00:18:45,113
KEVIN?
KEVIN?

258
00:18:47,074 --> 00:18:49,429

259
00:18:58,817 --> 00:19:03,674
>> OH, KEVIN, MERRY CHRISTMAS.

260
00:19:03,674 --> 00:19:07,334
I'M SO SORRY HONEY.

261
00:19:11,129 --> 00:19:14,259
OH, KEVIN, I MISSED YOU SO MUCH.

262
00:19:14,259 --> 00:19:16,405
>> BUT WHERE'S EVERYONE ELSE?

263
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:21,883
>> OH, THEY COULDN'T MAKE IT,
SWEETIE, THEY WANTED TO BUT --

264
00:19:24,698 --> 00:19:29,427
>> KEVIN!

265
00:19:29,427 --> 00:19:31,870
>> HEY BARF NUTS,

266
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:35,895
IT'S PRETTY COOL YOU DIDN'T BURN THE PLACE
DOWN.
>> THANKS, BUZZ.

267
00:19:35,895 --> 00:19:39,336
>> WAIT A MINUTE, HOW DID YOU
ALL GET HOME?

268
00:19:39,336 --> 00:19:44,026
>> WE TOOK THE MORNING FLIGHT,
REMEMBER?
THE ONE YOU DIDN'T WANT TO WAIT
FOR?

269
00:19:44,026 --> 00:19:47,108
>> I'VE BEEN AWAKE FOR 72 HOURS!

270
00:19:47,108 --> 00:19:50,022
>> SO WHAT DID YOU DO THE WHOLE
TIME YOU WERE ALONE, KEV?

271
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:53,081
>> OH, JUST HUNG AROUND.

272
00:19:53,046 --> 00:19:56,047
>> I'VE BEEN AWAKE SO LONG I'M
LEGALLY INSANE!

273
00:19:56,047 --> 00:20:00,235
>> NOW WE HAVE PLENTY OF TIME TO
HEAR ABOUT KEVIN'S LITTLE
ADVENTURES.

274
00:20:00,235 --> 00:20:01,806
LET'S ALL PUT OUR COATS AWAY --

275
00:20:01,806 --> 00:20:04,506

00:22:37,821 --> 00:22:41,160
>> OH, I THOUGHT THIS CLASS WAS
THREE HOURS.

302
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:43,850
>> NO, IT STARTS AT 3:00 AND
IT'S OURS.

303
00:22:43,850 --> 00:22:47,172
>> IT'S THEIRS!
TRY LISTENING, YOU OLD GIRL.

304
00:22:47,172 --> 00:22:49,183
>> THANK YOU, DENNISTON.

305
00:22:49,183 --> 00:22:53,756
OKAY LESSON ONE.
THE FIRST RULE OF GREAT DANCING

306
00:22:53,756 --> 00:22:56,273
IS --
FAST, FAST, FAST, SLOW.

307
00:22:56,273 --> 00:22:58,799
>> I'M SORRY, WHAT DOES THAT
MEAN?

308
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:01,545
>> EVERY POP STAR USES THIS
DANCE TECHNIQUE.

309
00:23:01,545 --> 00:23:03,570
IT STARTS OUT FAST, THEN YOU GET
SLOW.

310
00:23:03,570 --> 00:23:05,197
WATCH US.

311
00:23:05,221 --> 00:23:09,963
>> FAST FAST FAST SLOW.
FAST FAST FAST SLOW.

312
00:23:10,046 --> 00:23:12,457
WE SLOWED IT DOWN,
WE SLOWED IT DOWN FOR YOU,

313
00:23:12,457 --> 00:23:15,024
DID
YOU LIKE IT?

314
00:23:15,024 --> 00:23:17,345
DOES THAT ANSWER YOUR QUESTION?

315
00:23:17,345 --> 00:23:19,173
>> NOT REALLY.

316
00:23:19,173 --> 00:23:20,954
>> WHAT?
IT'S SO EASY.

317
00:23:20,954 --> 00:23:22,712
IT'S A FAST-FAST-FAST-SLOW!

318
00:23:22,712 --> 00:23:26,204
IT'S COCAINE, THEN RED WINE.
LIKE THIS.

319
00:23:26,204 --> 00:23:28,264
COCAINE, COCAINE, COCAINE,

320
00:23:28,264 --> 00:23:31,175
RED WINE.

321
00:23:34,887 --> 00:23:39,597
>> EXACTLY, DENNISTON.
YOU GET A KISS ON THE FOREHEAD.

322
00:23:39,757 --> 00:23:42,007
>> THANK YOU!

323
00:23:42,007 --> 00:23:46,888
>> I'M SORRY, I THOUGHT WE WERE
GOING TO BE LEARNING LIKE ACTUAL
DANCE MOVES.

324
00:23:46,888 --> 00:23:49,957
>> OH, I'M SORRY, WHO'S THE
EXPERT HERE?

325
00:23:49,957 --> 00:23:52,117
YOU WITH ZERO DANCE EXPERIENCE

326
00:23:52,117 --> 00:23:54,796
OR US, WITH SOME?

327
00:23:54,796 --> 00:23:57,881
>> WE ARE THE PEOPLE WHO
CHOREOGRAPHED THE DANCES

328
00:23:57,881 --> 00:24:00,272
IN
THREE JARDIANCE COMMERCIALS.

329
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:05,042
>> YES, BITCH.
WE MADE DIABETES LOOK LIKE
SOMETHING YOU WANT.

330
00:24:05,042 --> 00:24:07,359
>> IS THAT A GOOD THING?

331
00:24:07,359 --> 00:24:11,999
>> LISTEN PEOPLE, OKAY, LISTEN.
LISTEN TO US, PEOPLE.
OKAY?

332
00:24:11,999 --> 00:24:15,152
ANYTHING YOU WANT TO SAY YOU CAN
SAY WITH YOUR BODY.

333
00:24:15,152 --> 00:24:18,185
DANCE IS THE UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE.
WATCH ME.

334
00:24:18,185 --> 00:24:22,842
¶ I'M HUNGRY ¶
¶ I AM HUNGRY ¶

00:24:33,588 --> 00:24:37,597
>> YOU ACTUALLY CAN'T ASK ME
THAT IN RFK'S AMERICA.

340
00:24:37,597 --> 00:24:41,619
>> THEY STILL DON'T GET IT.

AND SHE HAD A BABY
SO I

344

345
00:24:54,579 --> 00:24:56,479
>> SOMEONE ELSE, PLEASE

346
00:24:56,479 --> 00:24:59,544
TELL US LITTLE BIT ABOUT YOURSELF
THROUGH THE ART OF DANCE.

347
00:24:59,544 --> 00:25:01,672
>> OH, OKAY.

358
00:25:32,710 --> 00:25:36,551
>> NOW REMEMBER, CLASS, DANCING
IS SOMETHING THAT'S REVEALING.

359
00:25:36,551 --> 00:25:38,664
FOR EXAMPLE, THIS IS HERS.

360
00:25:38,664 --> 00:25:41,543
>> YES, THANK YOU.

361
00:25:41,543 --> 00:25:43,646
THANK YOU.
>> YOU'RE WELCOME.

362
00:25:43,646 --> 00:25:49,124
>> I'VE ALWAYS SAID YOU CAN TELL
HOW SOMEONE HAS SEX SIMPLY BY
WATCHING THEM DANCE.

363
00:25:49,124 --> 00:25:51,548
>> I HIGHLY DOUBT THAT.

364
00:25:51,548 --> 00:25:54,048
>> OKAY, THEN SHOW US HOW YOU
DANCE.

365
00:25:54,048 --> 00:25:56,299
>> OKAY, OKAY.

366

00:26:03,850 --> 00:26:06,352
SEE?

369
00:26:06,425 --> 00:26:12,125
NOW FOR NO PARTICULAR REASON, I
HAVE TO GO.

370
00:26:17,761 --> 00:26:21,983
>> AND NO DANCE IS COMPLETE
WITHOUT A GRAND FINALE.

371
00:26:21,983 --> 00:26:24,260
>> AND NOTHING IS GRANDER THAN
TWO PEOPLE

372
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:27,707
THAT MADE THE DANCE
LOOK MUCH HARDER THAN IT WAS,

373
00:26:27,707 --> 00:26:30,204
OUT OF BREATH, ABOUT TO KISS.

374

NONSUSPICIOUS WAY.

622
00:41:04,479 --> 00:41:05,578
WAS MY FAVORITE CHARACTER IN THE

623

SPACEY.

627

PROBABLY BECAUSE HE HAD BOOKED A

00:41:14,489 --> 00:41:18,424
RECURRING ROLE IN THE EPSTEIN

629
