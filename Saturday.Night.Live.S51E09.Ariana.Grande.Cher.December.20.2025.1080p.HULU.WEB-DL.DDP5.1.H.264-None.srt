1
00:00:02,403 --> 00:00:07,527
>> Announcer: AND NOW A HOLIDAY
MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT OF
THE UNITED STATES.

2
00:00:09,677 --> 00:00:11,398
HI

3
00:00:11,398 --> 00:00:13,360
>> HO, HO, HO, HO.

4
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:15,965
WE'VE ADDED A FOURTH HO.

5
00:00:15,966 --> 00:00:18,185
WAS THREE

6
00:00:18,185 --> 00:00:21,564
IT'S ME, YOUR FAVORITE
PRESIDENT.
BACK AGAIN THIS WEEK.

7
00:00:21,564 --> 00:00:24,292
COMING TO YOU LIVE FROM A PART
OF THE WHITE HOUSE

8
00:00:24,292 --> 00:00:27,619
THAT
MELANIA'S CHRISTMAS DECORATIONS
HAVEN'T GOTTEN TO YET.

9
00:00:27,619 --> 00:00:30,927
THAT'S WHY WE STILL HAVE
FIREPLACE AND GARLAND

10
00:00:30,927 --> 00:00:34,533
AND NOT
SPOOKY TWIGS IN BLACK VASE.

11
00:00:34,533 --> 00:00:37,927
BUT WE HAVE TO BE VIGILANT THIS
CHRISTMAS AS AMERICANS.

12
00:00:37,927 --> 00:00:41,311
AS YOU KNOW, ARCTIC
IMMIGRANTS ARE COMING IN OUR
CHIMNEYS,

13
00:00:41,311 --> 00:00:43,651
STEALING OUR MILK AND
COOKIES.

14
00:00:43,651 --> 00:00:45,634
I THINK THAT'S WHERE NORTH POLE
IS, ARCTIC.

15
00:00:45,634 --> 00:00:47,925
WE'RE GOING TO LOOK INTO THAT.

16
00:00:47,925 --> 00:00:52,159
WE LOVE CHRISTMAS, CROSS THE
TREE.

17
00:00:52,159 --> 00:00:56,215
I KNOW I'M NOT SUPPOSED TO SAY
THAT OUT LOUD, BUT IT HELPS ME
OKAY.

18
00:00:56,215 --> 00:00:58,592
WE LOVE TREE.

19
00:00:58,592 --> 00:01:01,572
REMEMBER WHEN I DID THIS WITH
FLAG?

20
00:01:01,572 --> 00:01:05,763
DID YOU LIKE THAT?
I'M HUGGING TREE NOW.
IT'S VERY SHARP.

21
00:01:05,763 --> 00:01:09,878
I HUG FLAG AND TREE, JUST NEVER
PERSON.
RETURN TO PODIUM.

22
00:01:09,878 --> 00:01:12,961
CHRISTMAS IS GREAT, WE LOVE IT.

23
00:01:12,961 --> 00:01:16,117
I'M DOING MY OWN VERSION OF NATIVITY,

24
00:01:16,117 --> 00:01:19,325
KINGS FROM THE MIDDLE
EAST BRING GIFTS FOR ME,

25
00:01:19,325 --> 00:01:24,244
LIKE
GOLD, AN AIRPLANE AND CASINO IN
DUBAI.

26
00:01:24,244 --> 00:01:27,939
BUT UNLIKE NATIVITY, THEY'RE NOT
SHOWING UP ON CAMEL.

27
00:01:27,939 --> 00:01:29,940
I KNOW CAMEL VERY WELL.

28
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:33,488
I KNOW IT FROM MY MANDATORY DAILY
COGNITIVE TEST.

29
00:01:33,488 --> 00:01:36,897
I ALWAYS POINT RIGHT TO CAMEL,
ALWAYS GET IT RIGHT.

30
00:01:36,897 --> 00:01:39,659
IT'S THE BUMPY HORSE.

31
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:41,958
CAMEL, BUMPY HORSE.
I SAY IT A LOT.

32
00:01:41,958 --> 00:01:44,545
BUT I WANTED TO RAMBLE TO YOU TONIGHT

33
00:01:44,545 --> 00:01:48,062
ABOUT THE INCREDIBLE
THINGS THIS ADMINISTRATION IS
DOING.

34
00:01:48,062 --> 00:01:49,758
WONDERFUL STUFF.

35
00:01:49,758 --> 00:01:53,545
WE ARE RENAMING THE KENNEDY
CENTER FOR THE PERFORMING ARTS,

36
00:01:53,545 --> 00:01:55,508
WHICH WILL NOW BE CALLED

37
00:01:55,508 --> 00:02:00,888
THE TRUMP-KENNEDY CENTER FOR THE
PERFORMING ARTS, NO HOMO.

38
00:02:01,787 --> 00:02:03,619
AND I'M ACTUALLY GOING TO BE

39
00:02:03,619 --> 00:02:07,894
RENAMING A NUMBER OF OUR OTHER
MONUMENTS AS WELL.

40
00:02:07,894 --> 00:02:11,159
TRUMP WASHINGTON MONUMENT.

41
00:02:12,008 --> 00:02:14,824
TRUMP LINCOLN MEMORIAL.

42
00:02:14,824 --> 00:02:19,488
AND OF COURSE -- BIG ELPHABA.

43
00:02:19,488 --> 00:02:22,903
THAT'S WAS JUST FOR FUN.
THE THIRD ONE IS ALWAYS THE
FUNNY ONE.

44
00:02:22,903 --> 00:02:27,901
YOU KNOW, PEOPLE ARE SAYING,
SIR, WHY
ARE YOU PUTTING YOUR NAME ON SO
MANY BUILDINGS,

45
00:02:27,901 --> 00:02:31,700
AND I SAY
BECAUSE WE HAD TO TAKE IT OFF SO
MANY FILES.

46
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:34,856
EPSTEIN, REDACTED.

47
00:02:34,856 --> 00:02:38,888
WE HAD SO MANY TRUMPS IN THERE,
HAD TO PUT THEM SOMEWHERE, YOU
KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

48
00:02:38,888 --> 00:02:40,826
WE LIKE TO SAY REDACTED.

49
00:02:40,826 --> 00:02:44,787
IT'S MY SECOND FAVORITE R-WORD,
REDACTED.

50
00:02:44,787 --> 00:02:47,161
SHUT UP.
LOVE IT.

51
00:02:47,161 --> 00:02:49,991
IT'S BEEN A GREAT YEAR FOR
FOREIGN POLICY.

52
00:02:49,991 --> 00:02:54,682
I AM INVADING VENEZUELA BY
MYSELF, STYLE.

53
00:02:54,682 --> 00:02:58,869
THAT'S EXCITING.
I THINK THAT HIT WITH SOME OF
THE LOSERS IN THE CROWD.
MAYBE IT DID.

54
00:02:58,869 --> 00:03:02,704
AND THE ECONOMIC IS FINE, 

55
00:03:02,704 --> 00:03:05,518
CLOSER TO FINE.
INDIGO GIRLS.

56
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:09,405
THEY WERE ONE OF MY FAVORITE
LESBIAN FOLK ROCK DUOS,

57
00:03:09,405 --> 00:03:13,183
 I
BELIEVE IT WAS MELISSA ETHERIDGE
AND ELTON JOHN.

58
00:03:13,183 --> 00:03:15,988
THEY WERE GREAT.

59
00:03:15,988 --> 00:03:18,527
AND THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT, I
ALMOST FORGOT,

60
00:03:18,527 --> 00:03:20,861
I'M INVENTING MY OWN HUNGER
GAMES.

61
00:03:20,861 --> 00:03:24,646
THAT'S RIGHT, THE WHITE HOUSE
WILL BE HOSTING PATRIOT GAMES

62
00:03:24,646 --> 00:03:26,893
FOR HIGH SCHOOL ATHLETES TO
COMPETE.

63
00:03:26,893 --> 00:03:31,718
BECAUSE I THOUGHT WHAT'S THE
BEST WAY TO DISTRACT FROM THE
EPSTEIN FILES?

64
00:03:31,718 --> 00:03:35,235
OH, I KNOW, INVITE A BUNCH OF
TEENAGERS TO MY HOUSE.

65
00:03:35,235 --> 00:03:36,788
THAT WILL HELP.

66
00:03:36,788 --> 00:03:40,814
I'LL TAKE "THINGS A PEDOPHILE
MIGHT DO" FOR A THOUSAND, ALEX.

67
00:03:40,814 --> 00:03:44,507
BUT YOU CAN'T SAY ALEX ANYMORE,
RIGHT, YOU GOT TO SAY KEN.

68
00:03:44,507 --> 00:03:46,972
GOT TO SAY KEN.
CAN'T SAY ALEX.

69
00:03:46,972 --> 00:03:49,497
AND IT WAS MIYAM BIALIK FOR A
WHILE.

70
00:03:49,497 --> 00:03:51,968
I LIKE KEN.

71
00:03:51,968 --> 00:03:55,517
THEY'RE SAYING, SIR, YOU'RE
DOING HUNGER GAMES

72
00:03:55,517 --> 00:03:56,710
 AND YOU DON'T KNOW
HOW THE BOOK ENDS.

73
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:59,382
AND OF COURSE I DON'T BECAUSE
BOOK!

74
00:03:59,382 --> 00:04:03,280
I DON'T LIKE TO READ, AND
FRANKLY, MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO
ANYMORE.

75
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,071
WE'LL BE LOOKING INTO THAT
SHORTLY.

76
00:04:05,071 --> 00:04:08,274
BUT WITH REGARD TO FILES WE'RE
BEING VERY TRANSPARENT.

77
00:04:08,334 --> 00:04:10,702
BECAUSE JEFFREY
EPSTEIN WAS A TERRIBLE MAN

78
00:04:10,702 --> 00:04:12,936
 AND I
DIDN'T KNOW HIM AND I LIKED HIM
A LOT.

79
00:04:12,936 --> 00:04:18,312
SO WE RELEASED ALL THE FILES AND
I CAME OUT LOOKING FRANKLY VERY
GOOD.

80
00:04:18,312 --> 00:04:21,676
WE HAD TO REDACT A FEW SENSITIVE
THINGS BUT YOU'LL GET THE GIST
HERE.

81
00:04:21,676 --> 00:04:23,461
LOOK AT THIS.

82
00:04:26,475 --> 00:04:27,904
CHECK IT OUT.

83
00:04:27,904 --> 00:04:31,635
TRUMP.
DIDN'T.
DO.
NOTHING.
BAD.

84
00:04:31,635 --> 00:04:39,478
TRUMP.

85
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,012
DOES.

86
00:04:40,014 --> 00:04:41,113
SMASH.

87
00:04:41,115 --> 00:04:41,647
BUT.

88
00:04:41,649 --> 00:04:42,214
NOT.

89
00:04:42,216 --> 00:04:43,348
LIKE.

90
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:43,915
WRONG.

91
00:04:43,917 --> 00:04:44,416
KIND.

92
00:04:44,418 --> 00:04:45,517
THE END.

93
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:48,120
SEE, IT'S ALL THERE.

94
00:04:48,122 --> 00:04:48,854
CAN YOU BELIEVE IT?

95
00:04:48,856 --> 00:04:51,790
IN CONCLUSION, IT'S BEEN A GREAT

96
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:52,691
SECOND FIRST YEAR.

97
00:04:52,693 --> 00:04:55,827
I WANT TO WISH EVERYONE A MERRY

98
00:04:55,829 --> 00:04:57,429

99

103
00:05:07,875 --> 00:05:11,443
NIGHT LIVE" WITH --

104
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:18,804
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, ARIANA

105
00:07:18,806 --> 00:07:22,674
GRANDE!

106
00:07:46,098 --> 00:07:48,700
IT'S SO GOOD TO BE HERE TONIGHT

107
00:07:48,702 --> 00:07:49,734
HOSTING THE CHRISTMAS EPISODE OF

108
00:07:49,736 --> 00:07:54,673
SNL.

109
00:07:54,675 --> 00:07:56,308
THE LAST TIME I HOSTED WAS A

110
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:57,976
YEAR AGO, AND PEOPLE HAVE BEEN

111
00:07:57,978 --> 00:07:58,710
ASKING ME IF I'LL REVISIT SOME

112
00:07:58,712 --> 00:08:00,679
OF MY SKETCHES FROM LAST TIME.

113
00:08:00,681 --> 00:08:03,949
LIKE DOMINGO.

114
00:08:03,951 --> 00:08:05,016
BUT I TOLD THEM I DON'T THINK

115
00:08:05,018 --> 00:08:09,754
SO.

116
00:08:09,756 --> 00:08:14,092
WHEN SOMETHING IS PERFECT, IT

117
00:08:14,094 --> 00:08:14,659
DOESN'T NEED A SEQUEL.

118
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:14,960
WHAT?

119
00:08:14,962 --> 00:08:15,727
WHICH IS WHY I JUST FINISHED

120
00:08:15,729 --> 00:08:17,362
FILMING "MEET THE PARENTS 4."

121
00:08:17,364 --> 00:08:20,665
DECEMBER IS MY FAVORITE TIME OF

122
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:21,166
YEAR IN NEW YORK.

123

I THOUGHT YOUR HOME WAS WARM AND

00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:09,394
JOLLY.

354
00:17:09,396 --> 00:17:10,461
>> IT WAS.

355
00:17:10,463 --> 00:17:11,629
BUT THE OTHER DAY, THE GRANDPA

356
00:17:11,631 --> 00:17:13,731
WAS ALONE IN THE HOUSE AND FELL.

357
00:17:13,733 --> 00:17:15,933
AND BECAUSE SANTA WON'T LET US

358
00:17:15,935 --> 00:17:17,001

359
00:17:17,003 --> 00:17:19,203
WATCH THIS POOR MAN MOAN FOR

360
00:17:19,205 --> 00:17:22,206

WHILE MAKING THIS FACE!

362
00:17:25,745 --> 00:17:30,448
>> MAN, THAT AIN'T NOTHING!

363
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:36,654
I GOT EATEN BY MY FAMILY'S BIG

366
00:17:42,695 --> 00:17:44,295

368
00:17:45,365 --> 00:17:48,065
I CAME OUT THE BACK DOOR.

>> I SURE DO.

1019
00:44:02,624 --> 00:44:03,356
DO YOU THINK SANTA IS WATCHING

00:44:06,494 --> 00:44:07,460
PROBABLY.

1030
00:44:15,704 --> 00:44:17,503
LOOK IN THAT CAMERA, SAY WHAT

1035
00:44:20,275 --> 00:44:21,407
REMEMBER ME?

1036
00:44:21,409 --> 00:44:23,009
I ASKED FOR A BIKE LAST YEAR,

1037
00:44:23,011 --> 00:44:24,043
AND I DIDN'T GET ONE, AND THAT

1038
00:44:24,045 --> 00:44:25,111
KIND OF HURT MY FEELINGS.

1039
00:44:25,113 --> 00:44:26,779
BUT THIS YEAR I'M GOING TO GET

1040
00:44:26,781 --> 00:44:30,650

1046
00:44:35,123 --> 00:44:36,222
>> WHOA, TYSON!

1047
00:44:36,224 --> 00:44:37,356
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

1048
00:44:37,358 --> 00:44:40,059
>> WHAT?

1049
00:44:40,061 --> 00:44:42,228
I'M JUST A LITTLE KID WHO REALLY

1050
00:44:42,230 --> 00:44:43,496
WANTS A BICYCLE MORE THAN

1051
00:44:43,498 --> 00:44:47,066
ANYTHING IN THE WORLD.

1052
00:44:47,068 --> 00:44:48,468
>> WELL, THAT SOUNDS MORE LIKE A

1053
00:44:48,470 --> 00:44:48,801
THREAT.

1054
00:44:48,803 --> 00:44:51,237
>> I'M SORRY.

1055
00:44:51,239 --> 00:44:53,706
CAN I KEEP TALKING TO SANTA IF I

1056
00:44:53,708 --> 00:44:54,240
PROMISE TO BE NICE?

1057
00:44:54,242 --> 00:44:54,907
>> YEAH, TYSON, BUT SHOW A

1058
00:44:54,909 --> 00:44:55,675
LITTLE RESPECT.

1059

00:45:08,923 --> 00:45:11,324
NOT COMING ALONE WITH ME, BRING

INVASION AGAINST SANTA.

1073
00:45:24,005 --> 00:45:25,304

1074
00:45:25,306 --> 00:45:28,374
UNCLE CHE.

1075

I'M ONLY THIS MANY.

1076
00:45:30,345 --> 00:45:32,478

1077
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:34,747
YOU GOT TO STOP DOING THAT.

1078
00:45:34,749 --> 00:45:37,183
