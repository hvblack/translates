00:00:16,027 --> 00:00:20,778
EITHER THAT OR YOU'RE AT
COACHELLA AND THE 'SHROOMS ARE
KICKING IN.

00:00:20,778 --> 00:00:24,439

HAPPENS

13
00:00:53,678 --> 00:00:59,229
NOW REMEMBER THE SMEAR SPIRIT OF EASTER

14
00:00:59,229 --> 00:01:01,790
IS ABOUT RENEWAL AND THE
BIRTH.

15
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:06,937
THAT'S WHY I'VE INVITED FOLKS
FROM ALL WALKS OF LIFE
TO SHARE THEIR HOPES
FOR THIS EASTER SEASON.

16
00:01:06,937 --> 00:01:10,726
TAKE IT AWAY, DR. ANTHONY FAUCI.

17
00:01:15,763 --> 00:01:19,867
>> IT'S ME, YOUR BOY, FAUCI, I
KNOW, I KNOW.
I'M STILL HERE.

18
00:01:19,867 --> 00:01:21,871
TURNS OUT I'M LIKE LIZARD.

19
00:01:21,871 --> 00:01:27,129
NO MATTER HOW HARD YOU TRY TO
GET RID OF ME, I'M STILL
HAIR OR FACE

20
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:30,756
COVID

21
00:01:30,756 --> 00:01:33,718
I'M NOT STUPID ENOUGH TO THINK
YOU'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO FOLLOW
IT.

22
00:01:33,718 --> 00:01:37,841
ALL I CAN SAY IS COVID CASES ARE
A LOT LIKE JESUS,

23
00:01:37,841 --> 00:01:39,401
THEY'VE RISEN
AGAIN.

24
00:01:39,401 --> 00:01:43,448
IF YOU'RE VACCINATED, YOU'RE
GOING TO BE FINE.

25
00:01:43,448 --> 00:01:45,019
NOT

26
00:01:45,019 --> 00:01:48,077
I'M NOT SUPPOSED TO SAY THIS,
BUT I HONESTLY DON'T CARE WHAT
HAPPENS TO YOU.

27
00:01:48,077 --> 00:01:49,717
HAPPY EASTER, EVERYBODY.

28
00:01:51,162 --> 00:01:54,190
HI.
I'M MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE.

29
00:01:54,190 --> 00:02:00,189
AND AS I'VE BEEN SAYING
AGGRESSIVELY TO ALL MY JEWISH
AND MUSLIM COLLEAGUES, HAPPY
EASTER.

30
00:02:00,189 --> 00:02:04,058
DON'T WORRY.
THIS RIFLE IS CHOCOLATE, BUT THE
BULLETS ARE REAL.

31
00:02:04,058 --> 00:02:08,720
NOW, I'M WORRIED ABOUT EASTER.
BETWEEN THE PASTELS AND THE
JELLY BEANS,

32
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:13,334
THIS HOLIDAY'S
GOTTEN A LITTLE TOO LGBQRSA FOR
ME.

33
00:02:13,334 --> 00:02:16,120
AND THERE IS NOTHING GAY ABOUT EASTER,

34
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:20,711
A DAY WHEN A BUNCH OF
MALE PRIESTS WORSHIP A GUY WITH GREAT ABS

35
00:02:20,711 --> 00:02:24,143
AND TALK ABOUT WANTING
TO EAT HIS BODY.
THAT'S STRIKE STUFF.

36
00:02:24,143 --> 00:02:26,738
HAPPY
RUSSIA

37
00:02:26,738 --> 00:02:27,722

SO, I AM ELON MUSK.

56
00:03:37,931 --> 00:03:42,520
I AM HERE TO OFFICIALLY BUY
EASTER.

57
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:46,883
I'M OFFERING 43 BILLION PEEPS.

58
00:03:49,329 --> 00:03:52,108
THAT WAS A JOKE.

59
00:03:52,617 --> 00:03:54,049
DO YOU GET IT?

60
00:03:54,049 --> 00:03:58,300
THAT'S WHY AFTERWARDS, I SAY,
THAT WAS A JOKE,

61
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:01,286
SO YOU KNOW IT
WAS A JOKE.

62
00:04:01,286 --> 00:04:05,025
LOOK, I KNOW PEOPLE DON'T WANT
ME TO BUY TWITTER,

63
00:04:05,025 --> 00:04:08,940
BUT WHY?
YOU'RE WORRIED I'LL MAKE TWITTER
BAD?

64
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:13,653
WHAT ARE YOU SCARED I'LL BUY
NEXT?
THE OSCARS?

65
00:04:16,212 --> 00:04:18,896
THAT WAS A JOKE.

66
00:04:20,023 --> 00:04:22,921
HEY, Y'ALL, IT'S ME, BRITNEY.

67
00:04:22,921 --> 00:04:28,420
AND I BET YOU DIDN'T THINK I
COULD DO THIS.

68
00:04:34,457 --> 00:04:38,264
REMEMBER SIX MONTHS AGO WHEN
EVERYONE WAS LIKE,

69
00:04:38,264 --> 00:04:40,900
WE NEED TO
GET HER OUT OF THIS
CONSERVATORSHIP.

70
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:44,777
AND NOW YOU'RE ALL LIKE,
SOMEONE'S GOING TO CHECK IN ON
HER, RIGHT?

71
00:04:44,777 --> 00:04:47,661
WELL, DON'T WORRY.
I'M FINALLY FREE,

72
00:04:47,661 --> 00:04:50,837
AND  I'M HAVING A
BABY.

73
00:04:52,592 --> 00:04:56,444
I JUST PRAY THAT MY BABY IS BORN
HAPPY, HEALTHY,

74
00:04:56,444 --> 00:04:59,493
AND WITH POWER
OF ATTORNEY.

75
00:04:59,493 --> 00:05:01,869
HAPPY EASTER, EVERYONE.

76
00:05:04,171 --> 00:05:07,778
>> HEY.
IT'S ME, JESUS CHRIST.

77
00:05:07,946 --> 00:05:10,984
JUST KIDDING.
I'M JARED LETO.

78
00:05:12,965 --> 00:05:16,064
IT'S WHAT I WORE TO KIDS CHOICE
AWARDS.

79
00:05:16,064 --> 00:05:19,281
YOU KNOW, MY EASTER MESSAGE THIS
YEAR IS SIMPLE.

80
00:05:19,281 --> 00:05:20,793
POSITIVITY.

81
00:05:20,793 --> 00:05:26,021
SO, IF YOU GO TO SEE MY NEW
MOVIE, "MORBIUS," PLEASE DON'T
REVIEW IT.

82
00:05:26,021 --> 00:05:30,760
IF YOU'RE THE KIND OF PERSON WHO
REVIEWS MOVIES, "MORBIUS" JUST
ISN'T RIGHT FOR YOU.

83
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:33,478
I'LL SEE YOU ON THE BIG SCREEN.

84
00:05:33,478 --> 00:05:37,743
AND THE TWO LITTLE SCREENS
BEHIND YOUR EYELIDS WHEN YOU GO
TO SLEEP.

85
00:05:37,743 --> 00:05:39,718
LOVE PEACE.

86
00:05:39,718 --> 00:05:44,556
>> SO MANY FASCINATING
VIEWPOINTS.

87
00:05:44,556 --> 00:05:49,995
I GUESS IT'S TRUE WHAT THEY SAY,
SPRING IS A BEAUTIFUL REMINDER
OF WHAT CHANGE CAN BRING.

88
00:05:49,995 --> 00:05:52,792
>> EXCUSE ME.

89
00:05:52,792 --> 00:05:56,150
I WAS TOLD WE WERE DOING EASTER
WISHES.
AND I WAS NOT
GIVEN MY TURN.

90
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:58,224
THIS IS VERY, VERY UNFAIR.

91
00:05:58,224 --> 00:06:03,490
ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF HOW WHITES
ARE BEING HORRIBLY MISTREATED IN
THIS COUNTRY.

92
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:05,466
>> ALL RIGHT.
FINE.
GO AHEAD.

93
00:06:05,466 --> 00:06:09,594
>> EASTER IS A TIME FOR BASKETS
AND BUNNIES

94
00:06:09,594 --> 00:06:12,267
AND FRANKLY BONNETS.

95
00:06:12,267 --> 00:06:15,523
AND LET'S NOT FORGET EGG.

96
00:06:15,523 --> 00:06:18,480
YOU HAVE EASTER EGG, CADBURY EGG,

97
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:21,014
AND MY FAVORITE, WHICH IS
REESES EGG.

98
00:06:21,014 --> 00:06:23,358
THE REESES EGG DOESN'T LOOK LIKE EGG,

99
00:06:23,358 --> 00:06:26,885
BUT I LIKE REESE.
I'M VERY GOOD FRIENDS WITH
REESE.

100
00:06:26,885 --> 00:06:29,336
WE'RE VERY GOOD FRIENDS.

101
00:06:29,336 --> 00:06:32,014
DO YOU KNOW WHAT REESE SAYS?
HE SAYS, NOT SORRY.

102
00:06:32,014 --> 00:06:36,317
REESE SAYS IN A VERY DEEP VOICE,
NOT SORRY.

103
00:06:36,317 --> 00:06:39,299
AND THAT'S GOOD.
WE DON'T LIKE FOOD TO APOLOGIZE,
DO WE?

104
00:06:39,299 --> 00:06:41,592
LIKE THAT AWFUL CAPTAIN CRUNCH.

105
00:06:41,592 --> 00:06:45,677
HE WAS VERY RUDE TO ME AT COUNT
CHOCULA'S 500TH BIRTHDAY.

106
00:06:45,677 --> 00:06:48,975
BUT HE WAS DOING OOPS ALL
BERRIES.

107
00:06:48,975 --> 00:06:51,289
YOU'RE HEARING IT ALL THE TIME.
OOPS ALL BERRIES.

108
00:06:51,289 --> 00:06:54,154
BAD THING
WHY SAY OOPS?

109
00:06:54,154 --> 00:06:56,647
WE LIKE CRUNCH BERRIES.
BERRIES SO BEAUTIFUL.

110
00:06:56,647 --> 00:07:00,608
BERRIES SO BEAUTIFUL.
I'VE HEARD WE HAVE SOME OF THE
BEST BERRIES.
RIGHT MR. BUNNY?

111
00:07:00,608 --> 00:07:03,453
>> WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU TALKING
ABOUT?

112
00:07:03,453 --> 00:07:06,296
SOME PEOPLE ARE SAYING I'M NOT
HEALTHY, OKAY?

113
00:07:06,296 --> 00:07:08,923
I'M VERY GOOD WITH HEALTH.
VERY GOOD HEALTH.

114
00:07:08,923 --> 00:07:13,942
HEALTHY LIKE A HORSE, LIKE SEA
BISCUIT.
SEA BISCUIT -- I EAT BISCUIT.

115
00:07:13,942 --> 00:07:17,723
FRANKLY WE'RE DOING GREAT THINGS
WITH BISCUIT AND BUN

116
00:07:17,723 --> 00:07:21,857
AND BREAD.
WE'RE DOING CRAZY BREAD.
LITTLE CAESARS, YOU KNOW?

117
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:25,360
LONG TIME

118
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:31,145
I ACTUALLY TOLD HIM TO SAY PIZZA
PIZZA.

119
00:07:31,145 --> 00:07:35,482
HE NEEDS TO SAY IT ONCE.
I SAID, WE SHOULD BE SAYING IT
TWICE.

120
00:07:35,482 --> 00:07:37,318
WE SHOULD SAY IT TWICE.

121
00:07:37,318 --> 00:07:39,980
>> OKAY.
I'M ACTUALLY JUST GOING TO WALK
AWAY.

122
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:41,180
YOU WIN.
YOU CAN HAVE EASTER.

123
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:44,725
>> AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
I WOULD LOVE TO MEET BUNNY

124
00:07:44,725 --> 00:07:49,561
BECAUSE I TOLD AMERICA COVID
WOULD BE OVER BY EASTER.

125
00:07:49,561 --> 00:07:52,715
I JUST SAY WHICH ONE.

126
00:07:52,715 --> 00:07:55,423
SO, SAY IT EVERYONE, HAPPY
EASTER

127
00:07:55,423 --> 00:07:59,767
>> LIVE FROM NEW YORK, IT'S
SATURDAY NIGHT!

128
00:10:05,651 --> 00:10:10,115
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN --
LIZZO!

129
00:10:31,343 --> 00:10:34,739
>> THANK YOU!
THANK YOU VERY MUCH!

130
00:10:34,739 --> 00:10:39,862
MY NAME IS LIZZO, AND, YES, I'M
SHOCKED I HAVE CLOTHES ON TOO.

131
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:43,737
I'M REALLY EXCITED.
TONIGHT WE'RE GOING TO BREAK THE RECORD

132
00:10:43,737 --> 00:10:48,054
FOR THE AMOUNT OF TIME BITCH IS
SAID ON LIVE TV!

133
00:10:50,034 --> 00:10:52,311
BITCH, BITCH, BITCH.

134
00:10:52,311 --> 00:10:53,688
THAT'S THREE MORE.

135
00:10:53,688 --> 00:10:56,195
I HATE CUSSING IN FRONT OF MY
MOM.
HEY MAMA.

136
00:10:56,195 --> 00:10:58,480
BABY

137
00:11:02,125 --> 00:11:05,161
YEARS

138
00:11:05,161 --> 00:11:09,108
THE FIRST TIME MY MOM CAME TO
SEE ME PERFORM, I HAD TO WARN HER,

139
00:11:09,108 --> 00:11:12,380
MOM, WHEN I'M ON STAGE, I'M
GONE SAY SOME BAD WORDS.

140
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:14,439
AT THE TIME, SHE DIDN'T LIKE THAT,

141
00:11:14,439 --> 00:11:17,999
BUT NOW RICH SO SHE'S
LIKE, "BITCH, CUSS ME OUT."

142
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:20,952
FIVE

143
00:11:20,952 --> 00:11:25,943
BUT REALLY, THE LIZZO YOU SEE ON
STAGE IS DIFFERENT FROM THE REAL
ME.

144
00:11:25,943 --> 00:11:28,223
I GOT A SERIOUS SIDE AS WELL.

145
00:11:28,223 --> 00:11:33,282
LIKE, LAST YEAR, I HAD THE HONOR
OF GIVING A TED TALK.

146
00:11:34,449 --> 00:11:38,552
IT WAS VERY SERIOUS STUFF.
IT WAS ABOUT TWERKING.

147
00:11:38,552 --> 00:11:40,113
GOOGLE IT.

148
00:11:40,113 --> 00:11:42,247
IT WAS ACTUALLY ABOUT THE
HISTORY OF TWERKING

149
00:11:42,247 --> 00:11:45,643
AND HOW IT
COMES FROM WEST AFRICAN DANCES
LIKE MAPOUKA.

150
00:11:45,643 --> 00:11:48,186
YEAH, I'M DEEPER THAN YOU
THOUGHT, RIGHT?

151
00:11:48,186 --> 00:11:51,281
I'VE GOT BRAINS AND BOOTY.

152
00:11:51,281 --> 00:11:55,670
EINS

153
00:11:55,670 --> 00:12:00,120
BUT WHILE I'M HERE, I DO WANT TO
ADDRESS SOME RUMORS.

154
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:05,964
I READ A LOT ONLINE THAT I'M
DATING EVERY LITTLE WHITE BOY IN
HOLLYWOOD.

155
00:12:05,964 --> 00:12:11,777
THEY THINK I'M COLLECTING
MEMBERS OF ONE DIRECTION LIKE
INFINITY STONES.

156
00:12:11,777 --> 00:12:18,179
AND I EVEN HEARD A RUMOR THAT
I'M PREGNANT WITH CHRIS EVANS'
BABY.

157
00:12:18,534 --> 00:12:22,160
I HAVE NO IDEA WHERE THAT ONE
STARTED.

158
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:25,230
IT COULD BE THE TIKTOK WHERE I SAID,

159
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:28,960
I AM PREGNANT WITH
CHRIS EVANS' BABY, Y'ALL.

160
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:32,721
IT'S CALLED MANIFESTING, OKAY?

161
00:12:33,305 --> 00:12:36,578
BUT I AM HONORED TO BE UP HERE
ON THIS STAGE.

162
00:12:36,578 --> 00:12:39,887
WHEN I GOT THE CALL TO HOST
SNL, I WAS PRETTY NERVOUS.

163
00:12:39,887 --> 00:12:42,850
I KNOW IT'S SHOCKING
BECAUSE I'M THE ONE WHO
SAID,

164
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:45,280
"I JUST TOOK A DNA TEST, TURNS OUT

165
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:47,606
I'M 100% THAT BITCH."

166
00:12:47,606 --> 00:12:49,670
NUMBER ONE.

167
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:54,076
WELL, TO BE COMPLETELY HONEST,
I'M REALLY LIKE 50% THAT BITCH,

168
00:12:54,076 --> 00:12:55,836
10% BOSS BITCH,

169
00:12:55,836 --> 00:13:00,584
AND 40% FLUTE
PLAYING, BAND NERD BITCH.

170
00:13:03,099 --> 00:13:06,524
BUT I'M THRILLED TO BE HOSTING
THIS PARTICULAR EPISODE,

171
00:13:06,524 --> 00:13:11,134
ESPECIALLY BECAUSE I DO LOVE
TONIGHT'S MUSICAL GUEST.

172
00:13:11,134 --> 00:13:13,374
ME!

173
00:13:14,056 --> 00:13:17,898
NO, FOR REAL, I DO LOVE MYSELF.

174
00:13:17,898 --> 00:13:21,066
EVERYBODY SHOULD LOVE
THEMSELVES.

175
00:13:21,066 --> 00:13:26,514
YOU KNOW, AT EVERY SHOW, I TELL
MY AUDIENCE THE SAME THING, AND
I'LL TELL Y'ALL TOO.

176
00:13:26,514 --> 00:13:29,247
I LOVE YOU.
YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL.

177
00:13:29,247 --> 00:13:31,137
AND YOU CAN DO ANYTHING.

178
00:13:31,137 --> 00:13:33,434
I'M LIVING PROOF OF THAT.

179
00:13:33,434 --> 00:13:35,326
I USED TO LIVE IN MY CAR.

180
00:13:35,326 --> 00:13:40,438
NOW I'M UP HERE HOSTING
SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE.

181
00:13:41,211 --> 00:13:45,819
WE'VE GOT A GREAT SHOW
FOR YOU TONIGHT

182
00:13:45,819 --> 00:13:49,335
STICK AROUND WE'LL
BE RIGHT BACK

183
00:13:57,122 --> 00:14:02,000
TIME
HOST

184
00:14:05,312 --> 00:14:10,303
>> WELCOME TO "GUESS THAT!"
CLINT LITTERS.

185
00:14:10,303 --> 00:14:13,899
AND WE HAVE THREE WONDERFUL
CONTESTANTS PLAYING --

186
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:17,532
TRACY,
NICOLE, AND KENNY.

187
00:14:17,532 --> 00:14:19,932
NOW, WE ALL KNOW HOW THE GAME
GOES.

188
00:14:19,932 --> 00:14:23,050
I'LL ASK YOU GUYS A SERIES OF
RAPID FIRE TRIVIA QUESTIONS,

189
00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:26,268
AND
IF YOU GET THEM RIGHT, I'LL GIVE
YOU SOME MONEY.
SOUND GOOD?

190
00:14:26,268 --> 00:14:28,293
>> YEAH, LET'S PLAY.
>> SOUNDS GREAT, CLINT.

191
00:14:28,293 --> 00:14:30,185
>> ALL RIGHT, LET'S START.

192
00:14:30,185 --> 00:14:34,237
FIRST QUESTION -- THIS AMINO
ACID FOUND IN TURKEY

193
00:14:34,237 --> 00:14:36,317
IS KNOWN TO
MAKE YOU SLEEPY.

194
00:14:36,317 --> 00:14:39,175
>> THAT WOULD BE TRYPTOPHAN,
CLINT.

195
00:14:39,386 --> 00:14:42,340
>> CORRECT.
$100 ON THE BOARD FOR TRACY.

196
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:47,910
NEXT QUESTION.
THIS SURGERY USES LASER
TECHNOLOGY TO RESTORE VISION.

197
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:50,911
>> I'VE ACTUALLY HAD THIS, IT'S
LASIK SURGERY.

198
00:14:50,911 --> 00:14:53,522
>> YES.
THAT'S $100 FOR YOU, KENNY.

199
00:14:53,522 --> 00:14:56,541
OKAY.
THIS NEW YORK CITY AIRPORT

200
00:14:56,541 --> 00:15:00,779
WAS NAMED AFTER THE 35TH PRESIDENT
OF THE UNITED STATES.

201
00:15:00,779 --> 00:15:03,065
>> ROBERT KENNEDY AIRPORT.

202
00:15:03,065 --> 00:15:06,100
>> OH, SORRY, THAT'S ACTUALLY
INCORRECT.

203
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:07,807
>> NO, IT'S NOT!
I WAS JUST THERE.

204
00:15:07,807 --> 00:15:11,998
>> THAT'S STILL WRONG, NICOLE.

205
00:15:11,998 --> 00:15:15,591
>> HOW YOU GONE TELL ME?
I WAS JUST STUCK IN THAT AIRPORT FOR FIVE HOURS

206
00:15:15,591 --> 00:15:19,453
'CAUSE I PET A
BOMB-SNIFFING DOG AND THEY SAID
I RUINED HIM.

207
00:15:20,674 --> 00:15:23,785
>> THAT'S VERY CONFUSING TO
HEAR.

208
00:15:23,785 --> 00:15:27,327
KENNY?
>> IS IT JOHN F. KENNEDY
AIRPORT?

209
00:15:27,327 --> 00:15:28,671
>> THAT IS CORRECT.

210
00:15:28,671 --> 00:15:33,689
>> I -- I JUST SAID THAT.
>> UH, NO, YOU SAID "ROBERT
KENNEDY."

211
00:15:33,689 --> 00:15:35,905
>> OKAY, BUT YOU KNEW WHAT I
MEANT.

212
00:15:36,792 --> 00:15:39,992
>> OKAY, NICOLE.
WE HAVE A LOT MORE QUESTIONS.

213
00:15:39,992 --> 00:15:42,451
SO, THAT'S $100 FOR YOU, KENNY.

214
00:15:42,451 --> 00:15:44,777
>> AND WHAT DO I GET?

215
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:47,345
>> YOU DON'T -- YOU DON'T GET
ANYTHING.

216
00:15:47,345 --> 00:15:50,645
>> I GAVE HIM HALF THE ANSWER,
SO I SHOULD GET HALF THE MONEY.

217
00:15:51,497 --> 00:15:53,518
>> WELL, THAT'S NOT HOW THE GAME
WORKS.

218
00:15:53,518 --> 00:15:57,332
>> OH, OKAY, SO THEY GIVE YOU A
LITTLE SUIT AND SOME BLUE CARDS

219
00:15:57,332 --> 00:16:00,006
AND NOW YOU'RE THE MAYOR OF GAME
TOWN?

220
00:16:00,006 --> 00:16:04,261
>> I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS,
BUT YOU'RE SLOWING UP THE GAME.

221
00:16:04,261 --> 00:16:09,066
ALL RIGHT.
NEXT QUESTION.
IN 1492, THIS EXPLORER --

222
00:16:09,066 --> 00:16:11,650
NICOLE, YOU HAVE AN ANSWER
ALREADY?

223
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:13,702
>> I DON'T WANNA PLAY NO MORE.

224
00:16:15,718 --> 00:16:20,293
>> WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
>> YOU SAID I CAN'T WIN, SO I
DON'T WANNA PLAY NO MORE.

225
00:16:20,293 --> 00:16:24,746
>> I NEVER SAID YOU CAN'T WIN.
>> UH-UH, DON'T GASLIGHT ME.

226
00:16:24,746 --> 00:16:28,122
>> WHO'S GASLIGHTING?
>> Y'ALL SEE THIS, RIGHT?

227
00:16:28,122 --> 00:16:31,327
IF HE WANT ME TO LOSE SO BAD,
WHY DON'T YOU JUST LET ME QUIT,
CLINT?

228
00:16:31,327 --> 00:16:34,270
>> ALL RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT.
QUIT.
I DON'T CARE.

229
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:36,271
>> OKAY.
GIVE ME MY MONEY FIRST.

230
00:16:36,271 --> 00:16:40,040
>> WHAT MONEY?
YOU HAVE A SCORE OF ZERO.

231
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:42,665
>> WELL THEY SAY I GET $500 JUST
FOR PLAYING.

232
00:16:42,665 --> 00:16:44,858
>> YEAH, THAT'S IF YOU FINISH
THE GAME.

233
00:16:44,858 --> 00:16:49,833
>> OKAY, SO YOU'RE FORCING ME TO
PLAY, EVEN THOUGH YOU SAID I
CAN'T WIN.

234
00:16:49,833 --> 00:16:53,908
THIS MAN IS A CLASSIC
GASLIGHTING NARCISSIST, Y'ALL.

235
00:16:53,908 --> 00:16:57,114
>> CAN I JUST FINISH ASKING THE
QUESTIONS, NICOLE?

236
00:16:57,114 --> 00:17:01,528
>> GO AHEAD, BUT THAT HOTEL YOU
PUT US IN IS NASTY.

237
00:17:03,143 --> 00:17:05,826
>> WELL, I'M SORRY YOU FEEL THAT
WAY.

238
00:17:05,826 --> 00:17:10,945
IN 1492, THIS EXPLORER SET SAIL
TO DISCOVER THE NEW WORLD.

239
00:17:10,945 --> 00:17:12,679
>> CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS.

240
00:17:12,679 --> 00:17:16,583
>> YES.
THAT IS CORRECT.
$100 FOR YOU, KENNY.

241
00:17:16,583 --> 00:17:19,803
NICOLE?
>> CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS.

242
00:17:21,097 --> 00:17:22,735
>> YEAH, HE ALREADY SAID THAT.

243
00:17:22,735 --> 00:17:27,714
>> OKAY.
SO WHEN I REPEAT HIS ANSWER, I
DON'T GET NO MONEY, BUT WHEN HE
REPEAT MINE, HE GET $100?

244
00:17:27,714 --> 00:17:30,969
>> YOU GUESSED THE WRONG ANSWER,
NICOLE.

245
00:17:30,969 --> 00:17:34,479
>> NO, YOU HATE WOMEN.

246
00:17:34,479 --> 00:17:38,463
>> YO, CAN I -- CAN I JUST GIVE
HER 50 OF MY DOLLARS?

247
00:17:38,463 --> 00:17:40,364
>> YES.

248
00:17:40,364 --> 00:17:43,899
>> NO.
THAT IS NOT HOW THE GAME WORKS.

249
00:17:43,899 --> 00:17:47,343
AND STOP USING THE BUZZER EVERY
TIME YOU WANT TO SAY SOMETHING.

250
00:17:47,343 --> 00:17:51,823
WHO DIED AND MADE YOU THE MAYOR
OF GAME TOWN?

251
00:17:52,461 --> 00:17:57,753
>> GIRL, HE THINK HE THE MAYOR
OF GAME TOWN JUST BECAUSE HE GOT
A LITTLE SUIT AND A GUN.

252
00:17:57,753 --> 00:18:03,297
>> I DON'T HAVE A GUN.
AND I'M NOT THE MAYOR OF
ANYTHING.

253
00:18:03,297 --> 00:18:05,030
WHAT, NICOLE?

254
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:08,954
>> WELL, IF YOU DON'T WANT TO BE
THE MAYOR NO MORE, CAN I DO IT?

255
00:18:08,954 --> 00:18:10,482
>> NO!

256
00:18:10,482 --> 00:18:14,066
>> OH, OKAY.
SO, A WOMAN CAN'T BE A MAYOR OF
GAME TOWN?

257
00:18:14,067 --> 00:18:17,022
THERE IS NO GAMETOWN.

258
00:18:17,022 --> 00:18:20,861
>> HOW YOU GONE BE THE MAYOR OF
GAME TOWN, YOU DON'T EVEN

259
00:18:21,204 --> 00:18:23,919
>> 'CAUSE SEE, NOW I'M THE NEW
MAYOR.

260
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:29,500
AND THE FIRST THING I'M DOING IS
PUTTING US IN A BETTER HOTEL
WITH AN ESPRESSO MACHINE.

261
00:18:29,501 --> 00:18:31,248

265
00:18:44,516 --> 00:18:46,228
>> THAT'S NOT A GAME SHOW.

266
00:18:46,228 --> 00:18:49,129
>> THEN HOW COME I WON SO MUCH
MONEY?

267
00:18:49,129 --> 00:18:50,524
>> I DON'T KNOW.

268
00:18:50,524 --> 00:18:56,008
>> WRONG.
THE ANSWER IS I BURNT MY HAND.
NOW YOU OWE US $100.

MAKING MAJOR GAINS.

290
00:20:09,909 --> 00:20:16,750
TESTOSTERONE IS OFF THE CHARTS.

968
00:47:02,022 --> 00:47:07,727
IB THINK THAT WAS KIND OF MEAN.

969
00:47:02,022 --> 00:47:07,727
CAN WE EDIT THAT OUT?

970
00:47:02,022 --> 00:47:07,727

971
00:47:07,727 --> 00:47:14,034

NEPHEW?

975
00:47:14,034 --> 00:47:24,778

00:47:29,282 --> 00:47:33,820
ONE DAY.

982

00:47:33,820 --> 00:47:39,459
>> THAT'S REALLY SWEET BUT I

984

JUST TRUST YOUR MATERIAL.

986
00:47:39,459 --> 00:47:45,065
>> YOU'RE RIGHT.

987
00:47:39,459 --> 00:47:45,065
ANYONE HERE GOT A PISTON?

988
00:47:39,459 --> 00:47:45,065
I GOT A CRAZY SISTER.

989
00:47:45,065 --> 00:47:52,772
LOOK AT HER.

990
00:47:45,065 --> 00:47:52,772
SHE GOT PURPLE HAIR.

991
00:47:45,065 --> 00:47:52,772
YOU TRYING TO LAND A DAY WITH AN

992
00:47:52,772 --> 00:48:01,781
OOMPA.

993
00:47:52,772 --> 00:48:01,781
LOOMPA.

994
00:47:52,772 --> 00:48:01,781
THAT'S THE WORST MISTAKE SHE

995
00:48:01,781 --> 00:48:05,085
MADE SINCE GIVING BIRTH TO

996
00:48:01,781 --> 00:48:05,085
CARLITO

997
00:48:01,781 --> 00:48:05,085
>> CAESAR.

998
00:48:05,085 --> 00:48:12,759
>> I DID IT AGAIN.

999
00:48:05,085 --> 00:48:12,759
IT'S ALMOST EASTER.

1000
00:48:05,085 --> 00:48:12,759
JESUS IS GOING TO WAKE UP IN HIS

1001
00:48:12,759 --> 00:48:17,597
GRAVE AND BE SO DISAPPOINTED IN

1002
00:48:12,759 --> 00:48:17,597
ME.

1003
00:48:12,759 --> 00:48:17,597
YOUR FAMILY DOESN'T CARE THAT

1004
00:48:17,597 --> 00:48:23,203
YOU SMELL OR NAME YOUR LIZARDS

1005
00:48:17,597 --> 00:48:23,203
AFTER SUBSTANCE.

1006
00:48:17,597 --> 00:48:23,203
PLEASE FORGIVE ME.

1007
00:48:23,203 --> 00:48:31,277
>> ALL RIGHT.

1008
00:48:23,203 --> 00:48:31,277
WELL, MAYBE JOKES AREN'T YOUR

1009
00:48:23,203 --> 00:48:31,277
THINGS OR APOLOGIES.

1010
00:48:31,277 --> 00:48:35,548
>> I SHOULD STICK TO

1011
00:48:31,277 --> 00:48:35,548
IMPRESSIONS, LIKE THE ONE OF MY

1012
00:48:31,277 --> 00:48:35,548
AUNT LISA.

1013
00:48:35,548 --> 00:48:41,054
SHE'S CRAZY OLD.

1014
00:48:35,548 --> 00:48:41,054
SHE'S LIKE MY SKIN IS SO

1015
00:48:35,548 --> 00:48:41,054
WRIRNGALLED.

1016
00:48:41,054 --> 00:48:49,863
WHY DOES CARLITO KEEP TAKING MY

1017
00:48:41,054 --> 00:48:49,863
LOTION?

1018
00:48:41,054 --> 00:48:49,863
CAESAR.

1019
00:48:49,863 --> 00:48:56,069
EASY, SEIZER.

1020
00:48:49,863 --> 00:48:56,069
>> I KNOW.

1021
00:48:49,863 --> 00:48:56,069
IT'S TEARING ME APART.

1022
00:48:56,069 --> 00:49:05,078
CARLITO, LISTEN.

1023
00:48:56,069 --> 00:49:05,078
DON'T BE EMBARRASSED.

1024
00:48:56,069 --> 00:49:05,078
YOU WERE ONLY STAELTING IT TO

1025
00:49:05,078 --> 00:49:10,016
MOISTURIZE YOUR LIZARD.

1026
00:49:05,078 --> 00:49:10,016
YOU CAN BE A GROSS NERD YOUR

1027
00:49:05,078 --> 00:49:10,016
WHOLE LIFE IS AND STILL BE

1028

SUCCESSFUL.

1029

JUST LOOK AT COLIN JOST.

1030
00:49:10,016 --> 00:49:19,125

1031
00:49:19,125 --> 00:49:25,365

PARTY HERE IN THE THRONE ROOM.

1041
00:49:46,820 --> 00:49:53,059
WHY DON'T WE START BY GIVING

1042
00:49:46,820 --> 00:49:53,059
OURSELVES A ROUND OF APPLAUSE?

1043
00:49:53,059 --> 00:50:00,000
>> YEAH, THIS PARTY, ORGY,

1044
00:49:53,059 --> 00:50:00,000

WHEN IT COMES TO MY LITTLE

1074
00:50:36,236 --> 00:50:41,775
TENDER BOY, SHOULD I TEASE HIM

1075
00:50:41,775 --> 00:50:44,544

OH, OH!

1079
00:50:44,544 --> 00:50:48,648
>> OR MAYBE, I CAN PUNISH HIM

1080
00:50:44,544 --> 00:50:48,648
FOR BEING INSOLENT BY SMACKING

1081
00:50:48,648 --> 00:50:53,319

1082

1087
00:51:09,069 --> 00:51:12,939
>> HONESTLY, I LOVE BOTH.

1088
00:51:09,069 --> 00:51:12,939
>> HI, I'M SORRY TO INTERRUPT.

1089
00:51:09,069 --> 00:51:12,939
UM, I'M THE GUY WHO SPITS FIRE

1090
00:51:12,939 --> 00:51:14,674

I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU'RE

1093
00:51:14,674 --> 00:51:16,710

1094

SO, I'LL BE BY THE DOOR, AND

1095

WHEN SOMEONE COMES IN, IT'LL

1096
00:51:16,710 --> 00:51:19,579
JUST BE LIKE, "WELCOME TO THE

1097

DEN OF EARTHLY DELIGHT!"

1098

1110
00:51:43,570 --> 00:51:49,943

>> YEAH, I WAS TOLD TO JUST HANG

1117
00:52:02,756 --> 00:52:06,192
IN THE SHADOWS, BUT EMERGE IN

1118
00:52:02,756 --> 00:52:06,192
MOMENTS OF UNEASE.

1119
00:52:06,192 --> 00:52:08,161
MOMENTS OF UNEASE.

1120
00:52:06,192 --> 00:52:08,161

WE JUST WANTED TO GIVE YOU GUYS

1125
00:52:19,406 --> 00:52:21,307

I'M SO GLAD THAT

00:57:32,185 --> 00:57:41,428
YOU'RE STILL WITH US *

1301

BROKEN, BUT DAMN

YOU'RE STILL PERFECT *

00:57:48,501 --> 00:57:54,407
HEY *

1312
00:58:08,655 --> 00:58:09,222
>>> STOP, STOP.

1313
00:58:08,655 --> 00:58:09,222
THIS IS A DISASTER.

1314
00:58:12,092 --> 00:58:14,694
AND OUR FLAUTIST GETS FOOD

1315
00:58:12,092 --> 00:58:14,694
POISONING?

1316
00:58:12,092 --> 00:58:14,694
HOW AM I GOING TO FIND A

1317
00:58:14,694 --> 00:58:15,628
HOW AM I GOING TO FIND A

1318
00:58:14,694 --> 00:58:15,628
REPLACEMENT ON SUCH SHORT

1319
00:58:14,694 --> 00:58:15,628
NOTICE?

1320
00:58:22,302 --> 00:58:25,105
SOMEBODY LOOKING FOR A FLUTIST?

1321
00:58:22,302 --> 00:58:25,105
>> A FLAUTIST, BUT, YES.

1322
00:58:22,302 --> 00:58:25,105
WHO ARE YOU?

1323
00:58:25,105 --> 00:58:30,677
>> THE NAME'S TONY BANKS.

1324
00:58:25,105 --> 00:58:30,677
AND I JUST HAPPEN TO BE MANAGING

1325
00:58:25,105 --> 00:58:30,677
THE GREATEST FLUTIST OF OUR

1326
00:58:30,677 --> 00:58:32,545
TIME.

1327
00:58:30,677 --> 00:58:32,545
ALLOW ME TO INTRODUCE TO YOU THE

1328
00:58:30,677 --> 00:58:32,545
MASTER OF HER CRAFT.

1329
00:58:32,545 --> 00:58:35,248
LIPS AND LUNGS SENT FROM GOD

1330
00:58:32,545 --> 00:58:35,248
HERSELF.

1331
00:58:32,545 --> 00:58:35,248
THE INCOMPARABLE BEVERLY GAGS.

1332
00:58:35,248 --> 00:58:43,757
>> GOOD EVENING, YOUR HONOR.

1333
00:58:35,248 --> 00:58:43,757
>> I'M NOT A JUDGE.

1334
00:58:35,248 --> 00:58:43,757
I'M A CONDUCTOR.

1335
00:58:43,757 --> 00:58:48,228
MS. GAGS, IS IT?

1336
00:58:43,757 --> 00:58:48,228
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

1337
00:58:43,757 --> 00:58:48,228
BECAUSE AFTER YOU HERE HER PLAY,

1338
00:58:48,228 --> 00:58:52,065
YOU GOING TO GAG.

1339
00:58:48,228 --> 00:58:52,065
I MADE IT UP MYSELF.

1340
00:58:48,228 --> 00:58:52,065
>> OKAY, WELL, THAT'S WONDERFUL.

1341
00:58:52,065 --> 00:58:54,067
BUT THIS IS THE DEVRY INSTITUTE

1342
00:58:52,065 --> 00:58:54,067
SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA.

1343
00:58:52,065 --> 00:58:54,067
IF SHE WANTS FIRST CHAIR, I MUST

1344
00:58:54,067 --> 00:58:59,406
HEAR HER PLAY.

1345
00:58:54,067 --> 00:58:59,406
>> YOU AIN'T SAID NOTHING BUT A

1346
00:58:54,067 --> 00:58:59,406
WORD.

1347
00:58:59,406 --> 00:59:00,740
>> BITCH, SHOW THAT MAN WHAT YOU

1348
00:58:59,406 --> 00:59:00,740
GOT.

1349
00:58:59,406 --> 00:59:00,740
**

1350
00:59:00,740 --> 00:59:06,312
>> WOW.

1351
00:59:00,740 --> 00:59:06,312
LOOK AT THAT BREATH CONTROL.

1352
00:59:00,740 --> 00:59:06,312
>> YEAH, AND EVERYTHING ELSE

1353
00:59:06,312 --> 00:59:11,584
GOING ON TOO.

1354
00:59:06,312 --> 00:59:11,584
>> SO, SHE GOT THE PART?

1355
00:59:06,312 --> 00:59:11,584
>> WELL, SHE'S CLEARLY TALENTED,

1356
00:59:11,584 --> 00:59:21,461
BUT I JUST DON'T THINK SHE'S OUR

1357
00:59:11,584 --> 00:59:21,461
STYLE.

1358
00:59:11,584 --> 00:59:21,461
>> I DON'T KNOW, SIR, WE'RE IN

1359
00:59:21,461 --> 00:59:28,401
QUITE A BIND.

1360
00:59:21,461 --> 00:59:28,401
>> THE SHOW IS IN THREE HOURS.

1361
00:59:21,461 --> 00:59:28,401
DON'T DO THIS.

1362
00:59:28,401 --> 00:59:32,672
>> WELL, WHEN YOU PUT IT THAT

1363
00:59:28,401 --> 00:59:32,672
WAY, I SUPPOSE WE CAN ALLOW A

1364
00:59:28,401 --> 00:59:32,672
QUICK AUDITION.

1365
00:59:32,672 --> 00:59:37,744
SO, TAKE YOUR SEAT.

1366
00:59:32,672 --> 00:59:37,744
>> I'M SO EXCITED.

1367
00:59:32,672 --> 00:59:37,744
YOU WON'T REGRET IT,

1368
00:59:37,744 --> 00:59:55,795
MR. CONDUCTOR.

1369
00:59:37,744 --> 00:59:55,795
>> FROM THE TOP OF ODE TO JOY.

1370
00:59:37,744 --> 00:59:55,795
* *

1371
00:59:55,795 --> 00:59:59,799
>> STOP, STOP.

1372
00:59:55,795 --> 00:59:59,799
PLEASE.

1373
00:59:55,795 --> 00:59:59,799
>> WHY YOU STOPPING, JIM?

1374
00:59:59,799 --> 01:00:02,202
SHE WAS JUST GETTING IN THE

1375
00:59:59,799 --> 01:00:02,202
GROOVE?

1376
00:59:59,799 --> 01:00:02,202
>> OH, I DON'T KNOW.

1377
01:00:02,202 --> 01:00:08,341
MAYBE BECAUSE SHE WAS TWERKING

1378
01:00:02,202 --> 01:00:08,341
ON OUR BASSOONIST.

1379
01:00:02,202 --> 01:00:08,341
THIS IS A TRADITIONAL SYMPHONY.

1380
01:00:08,341 --> 01:00:14,981
YOU KNOW, ONE WHERE YOU SIT DOWN

1381
01:00:08,341 --> 01:00:14,981
AND PLAY.

1382
01:00:08,341 --> 01:00:14,981
>> OH.

1383
01:00:14,981 --> 01:00:21,254
SO, YOU WANT ME TO SIT DOWN ON

1384
01:00:14,981 --> 01:00:21,254
THE TWERK.

1385
01:00:14,981 --> 01:00:21,254
I GOT YOU.

1386
01:00:21,254 --> 01:00:25,658
**

1387
01:00:21,254 --> 01:00:25,658
>> NO, NO, NO.

1388
01:00:21,254 --> 01:00:25,658
NO.

1389
01:00:25,658 --> 01:00:34,501
NOBODY WANTS THAT.

1390
01:00:25,658 --> 01:00:34,501
>> I MEAN -- I WOULDN'T SAY

1391
01:00:25,658 --> 01:00:34,501
NOBODY.

1392
01:00:34,501 --> 01:00:40,106
>> LOOK.

1393
01:00:34,501 --> 01:00:40,106
MS. BEVERLY --

1394
01:00:34,501 --> 01:00:40,106
>> GAGS.

1395
01:00:40,106 --> 01:00:56,690
>> YOU THINK WE SAID HER LAST

1396
01:00:40,106 --> 01:00:56,690
NAME ENOUGH, OKAY?

1397
01:00:40,106 --> 01:00:56,690
>> I CAN'T DO THAT.

1398
01:00:56,690 --> 01:00:58,458
>> YEAH, SIR, THAT'S A TALL

1399
01:00:56,690 --> 01:00:58,458
ORDER, BUDDY.

1400
01:00:56,690 --> 01:00:58,458
>> HOW IS THAT A TALL ORDER?

1401
01:00:58,458 --> 01:01:00,660
YOU JUST SIT DOWN AND YOU PLAY A

1402
01:00:58,458 --> 01:01:00,660
SOLO.

1403
01:00:58,458 --> 01:01:00,660
>> IF YOU SAY SO.

1404
01:01:00,660 --> 01:01:07,367
>> STOP.

1405
01:01:00,660 --> 01:01:07,367
STOP.

1406
01:01:07,367 --> 01:01:13,306
WHAT WAS THAT?

1407
01:01:07,367 --> 01:01:13,306
YOU WERE PLAYING SO WELL BEFORE.

1408
01:01:07,367 --> 01:01:13,306
>> WELL, SIR, THE TRUTH IS --

1409
01:01:13,306 --> 01:01:16,176
**

1410
01:01:13,306 --> 01:01:16,176
THANKS, GIRL.

1411
01:01:13,306 --> 01:01:16,176
THE TRUTH IS THE ONLY WAY I CAN

1412
01:01:16,176 --> 01:01:18,778
PLAY THE FLUTE IS IF I'M

1413
01:01:16,176 --> 01:01:18,778
TWERKING.

1414
01:01:16,176 --> 01:01:18,778
SEE, TWO YEARS AGO, I COULDN'T

1415
01:01:18,778 --> 01:01:25,151
PLAY ANY INSTRUMENT.

1416
01:01:18,778 --> 01:01:25,151
AND THEN ONE DAY LAST SUMMER,

1417
01:01:18,778 --> 01:01:25,151
THE ICE CREAM TRUCK PULLED UP,

1418
01:01:25,151 --> 01:01:29,556
AND I HEARD THAT JINGLE.

1419
01:01:25,151 --> 01:01:29,556
AND THAT BEAT HAD MY BODY MOVING

1420
01:01:25,151 --> 01:01:29,556
IN WAYS THAT MADE ME FEEL

1421
01:01:29,556 --> 01:01:37,897
POWERFUL, LIKE I COULD DO

1422
01:01:29,556 --> 01:01:37,897
ANYTHING, EVEN PLAY THE FLUTE.

1423
01:01:29,556 --> 01:01:37,897
AND THE REST IS HISTORY.

1424
01:01:37,897 --> 01:01:43,603
>> WELL, I'M SORRY, BUT THIS IS

1425
01:01:37,897 --> 01:01:43,603
OUR FINAL PERFORMANCE OF THE

1426
01:01:37,897 --> 01:01:43,603
SEASON, AND IT WILL BE JUST TOO

1427
01:01:43,603 --> 01:01:48,942
DISTRACTING IF SOMEONE IS

1428
01:01:43,603 --> 01:01:48,942
TWERKING.

1429
01:01:43,603 --> 01:01:48,942
>> WELL, THEN, WHAT IF WE ALL

1430
01:01:48,942 --> 01:01:55,548
ARE TWERKING?

1431
01:01:48,942 --> 01:01:55,548
>> WHAT?

1432
01:01:48,942 --> 01:01:55,548
>> WE ARE THE DEVRY INSTITUTE

1433
01:01:55,548 --> 01:02:02,122
ORCHESTRA.

1434
01:01:55,548 --> 01:02:02,122
WE CAN DO THIS TOGETHER.

1435
01:01:55,548 --> 01:02:02,122
AND IF THAT MEANS I HAVE TO POP

1436
01:02:02,122 --> 01:02:25,278
THIS BOOTY FOR BEETHOVEN, THEN

1437
01:02:02,122 --> 01:02:25,278
SO BE IT.

1438
01:02:02,122 --> 01:02:25,278
**

1439
01:02:39,859 --> 01:02:46,966
>>> MAY THE NEXT CHAPTER BE AS

1440
01:02:39,859 --> 01:02:46,966
EXCITING AS THE LAST.

1441
01:02:39,859 --> 01:02:46,966
>> THANKS, BUDDY.

1442
01:02:47,834 --> 01:02:55,442
>> STILL CAN'T BELIEVE I FINALLY

1443
01:02:47,834 --> 01:02:55,442
QUIT MY JOB.

1444
01:02:47,834 --> 01:02:55,442
I REALIZED WHY AM I WASTING MY

1445
01:02:55,442 --> 01:03:00,347
LIFE AT A JOB I HATE WHEN I

1446
01:02:55,442 --> 01:03:00,347
DON'T HAVE TO WORK.

1447
01:02:55,442 --> 01:03:00,347
SO, I TOLD MY BOSS I QUIT.

1448
01:03:00,347 --> 01:03:05,318
>> I'M SO GLAD HE DID.

1449
01:03:00,347 --> 01:03:05,318
NOW WE CAN FINALLY START LIVING

1450
01:03:00,347 --> 01:03:05,318
OUR LIVES.

1451
01:03:05,318 --> 01:03:11,491
>> SO, WHAT'S THE PLAN?

1452
01:03:05,318 --> 01:03:11,491
WHAT'S NEXT?

1453
01:03:05,318 --> 01:03:11,491
>> EUROPE, BRAZIL, YOU NAME IT.

1454
01:03:11,491 --> 01:03:16,396
AND AS FAR AS MONEY GOES, WE'RE

1455
01:03:11,491 --> 01:03:16,396
NOT WORRIED.

1456
01:03:11,491 --> 01:03:16,396
STEVE HAS HIS INVESTMENTS.

1457
01:03:16,396 --> 01:03:23,370
>> INVESTING.

1458
01:03:16,396 --> 01:03:23,370
I GOT TO GET INTO THAT.

1459
01:03:16,396 --> 01:03:23,370
>> YOU MUST, PAUL.

1460
01:03:23,370 --> 01:03:26,473
FINANCIAL SAFETY IS SO

1461
01:03:23,370 --> 01:03:26,473
IMPORTANT.

1462
01:03:23,370 --> 01:03:26,473
YOU HAVE TO MAKE YOUR MONEY WORK

1463
01:03:26,473 --> 01:03:33,213
FOR YOU.

1464

YOU CAN INVEST IN A FUND, A

1465
01:03:26,473 --> 01:03:33,213
BUSINESS OR, IN MY CASE, I HAVE

1466
01:03:33,213 --> 01:03:40,687
MY BEANIE BABIES.

1467
01:03:33,213 --> 01:03:40,687

>> I'M HOLDING ON TO THESE BAD

1470
01:03:40,687 --> 01:03:47,227

1472
01:03:47,227 --> 01:03:51,765
>> NEEDLESS TO SAY, WE WON'T BE

1473
01:03:47,227 --> 01:03:51,765
WORRYING ABOUT MONEY FOR QUITE

1474
01:03:47,227 --> 01:03:51,765
SOME TIME.

1475
01:03:51,765 --> 01:03:58,538
>> THAT IS REALLY COOL.

1476
01:03:51,765 --> 01:03:58,538
BUT YOU KNOW THOUGH, I THINK I

1477
01:03:51,765 --> 01:03:58,538
HEARD A LOT OF BEANIE BABIES

1478
01:03:58,538 --> 01:04:05,679
AREN'T ACTUALLY WORTH THAT MUCH.

1479
01:03:58,538 --> 01:04:05,679

1480
01:03:58,538 --> 01:04:05,679
>> I MEAN, YES, THEY'RE

1481
01:04:05,679 --> 01:04:12,419
ESSENTIALLY WORTHLESS.

1482
01:04:05,679 --> 01:04:12,419
>> HUH.

1483
01:04:05,679 --> 01:04:12,419
ALL OF THEM?

1484
01:04:12,419 --> 01:04:21,795
>> MOST.

1485
01:04:12,419 --> 01:04:21,795
>> HUH.

1486
01:04:12,419 --> 01:04:21,795
GOD DAM IT.

1487
01:04:21,795 --> 01:04:29,302
>> THAT WAS OUR SAVINGS.

1488
01:04:21,795 --> 01:04:29,302
>> IT WAS WORTHLESS.

1489
01:04:21,795 --> 01:04:29,302
DON'T YOU SEE MY LIFE'S WORK IS

1490
01:04:29,302 --> 01:04:37,110
WORTHLESS.

1491
01:04:29,302 --> 01:04:37,110

1492
01:04:29,302 --> 01:04:37,110

1494
01:04:37,110 --> 01:04:42,549

1495
01:04:37,110 --> 01:04:42,549

1500
01:04:46,553 --> 01:04:51,891
>> WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO,

1501
01:04:46,553 --> 01:04:51,891
STEVE?

1502
01:04:51,891 --> 01:04:56,963
WE'RE GOING TO LOSE THE HOUSE.

1503
01:04:51,891 --> 01:04:56,963
>> MAYBE I START DRAWING MARIO

1504
01:04:51,891 --> 01:04:56,963
FULL TIME.

1505
01:04:56,963 --> 01:05:01,434
LAST WEEK I DREW YOU A MARIO.

1506
01:04:56,963 --> 01:05:01,434
IO SAID IT WAS THE BEST ONE YOU

1507
01:04:56,963 --> 01:05:01,434
HAD EVER SEEN.

1508
01:05:01,434 --> 01:05:09,275
>> IT WAS.

1509
01:05:01,434 --> 01:05:09,275
IT WAS BETTER THAN THE ACTUAL

1510
01:05:01,434 --> 01:05:09,275
MARIO BUT DRAWING MARIO ISN'T A

1511
01:05:09,275 --> 01:05:14,280
DRAW, STEVE.

1512
01:05:09,275 --> 01:05:14,280
>> SOMEBODY SOMEWHERE IS DRAWING

1513
01:05:09,275 --> 01:05:14,280
MARIO.

1514
01:05:14,280 --> 01:05:19,486
DO YOU EXPECT ME TO BELIEVE

1515
01:05:14,280 --> 01:05:19,486
NINTENDO HAS NO INTEREST IN THE

1516
01:05:14,280 --> 01:05:19,486
MAN WHO DID THIS?

1517
01:05:19,486 --> 01:05:24,691
>> I'M SORRY.

1518
01:05:19,486 --> 01:05:24,691
BUT THAT ISN'T REALLY A VERY

1519
01:05:19,486 --> 01:05:24,691
GOOD MARIO.

1520
01:05:24,691 --> 01:05:29,195
>> IS THAT LOUIGI?

1521
01:05:24,691 --> 01:05:29,195
>> YOU DON'T HAVE FOOLIE.

1522
01:05:24,691 --> 01:05:29,195

MARIO.

1524
01:05:29,195 --> 01:05:37,504

1525
01:05:29,195 --> 01:05:37,504

1526
01:05:37,504 --> 01:05:44,711
I NEED TO TELL YOU.

01:05:37,504 --> 01:05:44,711
I SHOULDN'T BE DRINKING THAT.

1528
01:05:37,504 --> 01:05:44,711
THE REASON I'M WORRIED ABOUT

1529
01:05:44,711 --> 01:05:51,584
MONEY IS BECAUSE YOU'RE GOING TO

1530
01:05:44,711 --> 01:05:51,584
BE A DADDY.

1531
