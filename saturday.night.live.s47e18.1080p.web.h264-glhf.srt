IT'S REALLY ME, THE EASTER

00:00:16,027 --> 00:00:20,778
EITHER THAT OR YOU'RE AT
COACHELLA AND THE 'SHROOMS ARE
KICKING IN.

00:00:20,778 --> 00:00:24,439
HOW IS EVERYONE TONIGHT?

00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:31,578

HAPPENS

13
00:00:53,678 --> 00:00:59,229
NOW REMEMBER THE SMEAR SPIRIT OF EASTER

14
00:00:59,229 --> 00:01:01,790
IS ABOUT RENEWAL AND THE
BIRTH.

15
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:06,937
THAT'S WHY I'VE INVITED FOLKS
FROM ALL WALKS OF LIFE
TO SHARE THEIR HOPES
FOR THIS EASTER SEASON.

16
00:01:06,937 --> 00:01:10,726
TAKE IT AWAY, DR. ANTHONY FAUCI.

17
00:01:15,763 --> 00:01:19,867
>> IT'S ME, YOUR BOY, FAUCI, I
KNOW, I KNOW.
I'M STILL HERE.

18
00:01:19,867 --> 00:01:21,851
TURNS OUT I'M LIKE LIZARD.

19
00:01:21,921 --> 00:01:27,129
NO MATTER HOW HARD YOU TRY TO
GET RID OF ME, I'M STILL
HAIR OR FACE

20
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:30,756
COVID

21
00:01:30,756 --> 00:01:33,693
I'M NOT STUPID ENOUGH TO THINK
YOU'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO FOLLOW
IT.

22
00:01:33,778 --> 00:01:37,841
ALL I CAN SAY IS COVID CASES ARE
A LOT LIKE JESUS,

23
00:01:37,841 --> 00:01:39,401
THEY'VE RISEN
AGAIN.

24
00:01:39,401 --> 00:01:43,448
IF YOU'RE VACCINATED, YOU'RE
GOING TO BE FINE.

25
00:01:43,448 --> 00:01:45,019
IF YOU'RE VACCINATED, YOU'RE
GOING TO BE FINE.

26
00:01:45,019 --> 00:01:48,077
I'M NOT SUPPOSED TO SAY THIS,
BUT I HONESTLY DON'T CARE WHAT
HAPPENS TO YOU.

27
00:01:48,077 --> 00:01:49,717
HAPPY EASTER, EVERYBODY.

28
00:01:51,162 --> 00:01:54,190
HI.
I'M MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE.

29
00:01:54,190 --> 00:02:00,189
AND AS I'VE BEEN SAYING
AGGRESSIVELY TO ALL MY JEWISH
AND MUSLIM COLLEAGUES, HAPPY
EASTER.

30
00:02:00,189 --> 00:02:04,058
DON'T WORRY.
THIS RIFLE IS CHOCOLATE, BUT THE
BULLETS ARE REAL.

31
00:02:04,058 --> 00:02:08,720
NOW, I'M WORRIED ABOUT EASTER.
BETWEEN THE PASTELS AND THE
JELLY BEANS,

32
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:13,334
THIS HOLIDAY'S
GOTTEN A LITTLE TOO LGBQRSA FOR
ME.

33
00:02:13,334 --> 00:02:16,120
AND THERE IS NOTHING GAY ABOUT EASTER,

34
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:20,678
A DAY WHEN A BUNCH OF
MALE PRIESTS WORSHIP A GUY WITH GREAT ABS

35
00:02:20,747 --> 00:02:24,143
AND TALK ABOUT WANTING
TO EAT HIS BODY.
THAT'S STRIKE STUFF.

36
00:02:24,143 --> 00:02:26,738
HAPPY
RUSSIA

37
00:02:26,738 --> 00:02:27,722

00:03:33,148 --> 00:03:37,931
>> HELLO.
SO, I AM ELON MUSK.

56
00:03:37,931 --> 00:03:42,520
I AM HERE TO OFFICIALLY BUY
EASTER.

57
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:46,883
I'M OFFERING 43 BILLION PEEPS.

58
00:03:49,329 --> 00:03:52,108
THAT WAS A JOKE.

59
00:03:52,617 --> 00:03:54,049
DO YOU GET IT?

60
00:03:54,049 --> 00:03:58,300
THAT'S WHY AFTERWARDS, I SAY,
THAT WAS A JOKE,

61
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:01,286
SO YOU KNOW IT
WAS A JOKE.

62
00:04:01,286 --> 00:04:05,025
LOOK, I KNOW PEOPLE DON'T WANT
ME TO BUY TWITTER,

63
00:04:05,025 --> 00:04:08,940
BUT WHY?
YOU'RE WORRIED I'LL MAKE TWITTER
BAD?

64
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:13,653
WHAT ARE YOU SCARED I'LL BUY
NEXT?
THE OSCARS?

65
00:04:16,212 --> 00:04:18,896
THAT WAS A JOKE.

66
00:04:20,023 --> 00:04:22,921
HEY, Y'ALL, IT'S ME, BRITNEY.

67
00:04:22,921 --> 00:04:28,420
AND I BET YOU DIDN'T THINK I
COULD DO THIS.

68
00:04:34,457 --> 00:04:38,264
REMEMBER SIX MONTHS AGO WHEN
EVERYONE WAS LIKE,

69
00:04:38,264 --> 00:04:40,900
WE NEED TO
GET HER OUT OF THIS
CONSERVATORSHIP.

70
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:44,724
AND NOW YOU'RE ALL LIKE,
SOMEONE'S GOING TO CHECK IN ON
HER, RIGHT?

71
00:04:44,802 --> 00:04:47,661
WELL, DON'T WORRY.
I'M FINALLY FREE,

72
00:04:47,661 --> 00:04:50,837
AND  I'M HAVING A
BABY.

73
00:04:52,592 --> 00:04:56,444
I JUST PRAY THAT MY BABY IS BORN
HAPPY, HEALTHY,

74
00:04:56,444 --> 00:04:59,493
AND WITH POWER
OF ATTORNEY.

75
00:04:59,493 --> 00:05:01,869
HAPPY EASTER, EVERYONE.

76
00:05:04,171 --> 00:05:07,778
>> HEY.
IT'S ME, JESUS CHRIST.

77
00:05:07,846 --> 00:05:10,984
JUST KIDDING.
I'M JARED LETO.

78
00:05:12,965 --> 00:05:16,064
IT'S WHAT I WORE TO KIDS CHOICE
AWARDS.

79
00:05:16,064 --> 00:05:19,281
YOU KNOW, MY EASTER MESSAGE THIS
YEAR IS SIMPLE.

80
00:05:19,281 --> 00:05:20,793
POSITIVITY.

81
00:05:20,793 --> 00:05:26,021
SO, IF YOU GO TO SEE MY NEW
MOVIE, "MORBIUS," PLEASE DON'T
REVIEW IT.

82
00:05:26,021 --> 00:05:30,760
IF YOU'RE THE KIND OF PERSON WHO
REVIEWS MOVIES, "MORBIUS" JUST
ISN'T RIGHT FOR YOU.

83
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:33,478
I'LL SEE YOU ON THE BIG SCREEN.

84
00:05:33,478 --> 00:05:37,743
AND THE TWO LITTLE SCREENS
BEHIND YOUR EYELIDS WHEN YOU GO
TO SLEEP.

85
00:05:37,743 --> 00:05:39,718
LOVE PEACE.

86
00:05:39,718 --> 00:05:44,556
>> SO MANY FASCINATING
VIEWPOINTS.

87
00:05:44,556 --> 00:05:49,995
I GUESS IT'S TRUE WHAT THEY SAY,
SPRING IS A BEAUTIFUL REMINDER
OF WHAT CHANGE CAN BRING.

88
00:05:49,995 --> 00:05:52,792
>> EXCUSE ME.

89
00:05:52,792 --> 00:05:56,129
I WAS TOLD WE WERE DOING EASTER
WISHES.
AND I WAS NOT
GIVEN MY TURN.

90
00:05:56,241 --> 00:05:58,224
THIS IS VERY, VERY UNFAIR.

91
00:05:58,224 --> 00:06:03,490
ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF HOW WHITES
ARE BEING HORRIBLY MISTREATED IN
THIS COUNTRY.

92
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:05,466
>> ALL RIGHT.
FINE.
GO AHEAD.

93
00:06:05,466 --> 00:06:09,594
>> EASTER IS A TIME FOR BASKETS
AND BUNNIES

94
00:06:09,594 --> 00:06:12,267
AND FRANKLY BONNETS.

95
00:06:12,267 --> 00:06:15,523
AND LET'S NOT FORGET EGG.

96
00:06:15,523 --> 00:06:18,499
YOU HAVE EASTER EGG, CADBURY EGG,

97
00:06:18,502 --> 00:06:20,916
AND MY FAVORITE, WHICH IS
REESES EGG.

98
00:06:20,916 --> 00:06:23,358
THE REESES EGG DOESN'T LOOK LIKE EGG,

99
00:06:23,358 --> 00:06:26,885
BUT I LIKE REESE.
I'M VERY GOOD FRIENDS WITH
REESE.

100
00:06:26,885 --> 00:06:29,336
WE'RE VERY GOOD FRIENDS.

101
00:06:29,336 --> 00:06:32,014
DO YOU KNOW WHAT REESE SAYS?
HE SAYS, NOT SORRY.

102
00:06:32,014 --> 00:06:36,317
REESE SAYS IN A VERY DEEP VOICE,
NOT SORRY.

103
00:06:36,317 --> 00:06:39,299
AND THAT'S GOOD.
WE DON'T LIKE FOOD TO APOLOGIZE,
DO WE?

104
00:06:39,299 --> 00:06:41,592
LIKE THAT AWFUL CAPTAIN CRUNCH.

105
00:06:41,592 --> 00:06:45,677
HE WAS VERY RUDE TO ME AT COUNT
CHOCULA'S 500TH BIRTHDAY.

106
00:06:45,677 --> 00:06:48,975
BUT HE WAS DOING OOPS ALL
BERRIES.

107
00:06:48,975 --> 00:06:51,289
YOU'RE HEARING IT ALL THE TIME.
OOPS ALL BERRIES.

108
00:06:51,289 --> 00:06:54,123
BAD THING
WHY SAY OOPS?

109
00:06:54,194 --> 00:06:56,647
WE LIKE CRUNCH BERRIES.
BERRIES SO BEAUTIFUL.

110
00:06:56,647 --> 00:07:00,608
BERRIES SO BEAUTIFUL.
I'VE HEARD WE HAVE SOME OF THE
BEST BERRIES.
RIGHT MR. BUNNY?

111
00:07:00,608 --> 00:07:03,453
>> WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU TALKING
ABOUT?

112
00:07:03,453 --> 00:07:06,296
SOME PEOPLE ARE SAYING I'M NOT
HEALTHY, OKAY?

113
00:07:06,296 --> 00:07:08,923
I'M VERY GOOD WITH HEALTH.
VERY GOOD HEALTH.

114
00:07:08,923 --> 00:07:13,942
HEALTHY LIKE A HORSE, LIKE SEA
BISCUIT.
SEA BISCUIT -- I EAT BISCUIT.

115
00:07:13,942 --> 00:07:17,723
FRANKLY WE'RE DOING GREAT THINGS
WITH BISCUIT AND BUN

116
00:07:17,723 --> 00:07:21,857
AND BREAD.
WE'RE DOING CRAZY BREAD.
LITTLE CAESARS, YOU KNOW?

117
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:25,360
LITTLE
LONG TIME

118
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:31,145
I ACTUALLY TOLD HIM TO SAY PIZZA
PIZZA.

119
00:07:31,145 --> 00:07:35,482
HE NEEDS TO SAY IT ONCE.
I SAID, WE SHOULD BE SAYING IT
TWICE.

120
00:07:35,482 --> 00:07:37,318
WE SHOULD SAY IT TWICE.

121
00:07:37,318 --> 00:07:39,980
>> OKAY.
I'M ACTUALLY JUST GOING TO WALK
AWAY.

122
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:41,180
YOU WIN.
YOU CAN HAVE EASTER.

123
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:44,725
>> AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
I WOULD LOVE TO MEET BUNNY

124
00:07:44,725 --> 00:07:49,561
BECAUSE I TOLD AMERICA COVID
WOULD BE OVER BY EASTER.

125
00:07:49,561 --> 00:07:52,715
I JUST SAY WHICH ONE.

126
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,423
SO, SAY IT EVERYONE, HAPPY
EASTER

127
00:07:55,423 --> 00:07:59,767
>> LIVE FROM NEW YORK, IT'S
SATURDAY NIGHT!

128
00:10:05,651 --> 00:10:10,115
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN --
LIZZO!

129
00:10:31,343 --> 00:10:34,739
>> THANK YOU!
THANK YOU VERY MUCH!

130
00:10:34,739 --> 00:10:39,862
MY NAME IS LIZZO, AND, YES, I'M
SHOCKED I HAVE CLOTHES ON TOO.

131
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:43,737
I'M REALLY EXCITED.
TONIGHT WE'RE GOING TO BREAK THE RECORD

132
00:10:43,737 --> 00:10:48,054
FOR THE AMOUNT OF TIME BITCH IS
SAID ON LIVE TV!

133
00:10:50,034 --> 00:10:52,311
BITCH, BITCH, BITCH.

134
00:10:52,311 --> 00:10:53,688
THAT'S THREE MORE.

135
00:10:53,688 --> 00:10:56,195
I HATE CUSSING IN FRONT OF MY
MOM.
HEY MAMA.

136
00:10:56,195 --> 00:10:58,480
BABY

137
00:11:02,125 --> 00:11:05,161
YEARS

138
00:11:05,161 --> 00:11:09,108
THE FIRST TIME MY MOM CAME TO
SEE ME PERFORM, I HAD TO WARN HER,

139
00:11:09,108 --> 00:11:12,380
MOM, WHEN I'M ON STAGE, I'M
GONE SAY SOME BAD WORDS.

140
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:14,439
AT THE TIME, SHE DIDN'T LIKE THAT,

141
00:11:14,439 --> 00:11:17,999
BUT NOW RICH SO SHE'S
LIKE, "BITCH, CUSS ME OUT."

142
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:20,952
FIVE

143
00:11:20,952 --> 00:11:25,943
BUT REALLY, THE LIZZO YOU SEE ON
STAGE IS DIFFERENT FROM THE REAL
ME.

144
00:11:25,943 --> 00:11:28,223
I GOT A SERIOUS SIDE AS WELL.

145
00:11:28,223 --> 00:11:33,282
LIKE, LAST YEAR, I HAD THE HONOR
OF GIVING A TED TALK.

146
00:11:34,449 --> 00:11:38,552
IT WAS VERY SERIOUS STUFF.
IT WAS ABOUT TWERKING.

147
00:11:38,552 --> 00:11:40,113
GOOGLE IT.

148
00:11:40,113 --> 00:11:42,247
IT WAS ACTUALLY ABOUT THE
HISTORY OF TWERKING

149
00:11:42,247 --> 00:11:45,643
AND HOW IT
COMES FROM WEST AFRICAN DANCES
LIKE MAPOUKA.

150
00:11:45,643 --> 00:11:48,186
YEAH, I'M DEEPER THAN YOU
THOUGHT, RIGHT?

151
00:11:48,186 --> 00:11:51,281
I'VE GOT BRAINS AND BOOTY.

152
00:11:51,281 --> 00:11:55,670
EINS

153
00:11:55,670 --> 00:12:00,120
BUT WHILE I'M HERE, I DO WANT TO
ADDRESS SOME RUMORS.

154
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:05,964
I READ A LOT ONLINE THAT I'M
DATING EVERY LITTLE WHITE BOY IN
HOLLYWOOD.

155
00:12:05,964 --> 00:12:11,777
THEY THINK I'M COLLECTING
MEMBERS OF ONE DIRECTION LIKE
INFINITY STONES.

156
00:12:11,777 --> 00:12:18,179
AND I EVEN HEARD A RUMOR THAT
I'M PREGNANT WITH CHRIS EVANS'
BABY.

157
00:12:18,534 --> 00:12:22,160
I HAVE NO IDEA WHERE THAT ONE
STARTED.

158
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:25,230
IT COULD BE THE TIKTOK WHERE I SAID,

159
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:28,960
I AM PREGNANT WITH
CHRIS EVANS' BABY, Y'ALL.

160
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:32,721
IT'S CALLED MANIFESTING, OKAY?

161
00:12:33,305 --> 00:12:36,578
BUT I AM HONORED TO BE UP HERE
ON THIS STAGE.

162
00:12:36,578 --> 00:12:39,887
WHEN I GOT THE CALL TO HOST
SNL, I WAS PRETTY NERVOUS.

163
00:12:39,887 --> 00:12:42,807
I KNOW IT'S SHOCKING
BECAUSE I'M THE ONE WHO
SAID,

164
00:12:42,903 --> 00:12:45,266
"I JUST TOOK A DNA TEST, TURNS OUT

165
00:12:45,328 --> 00:12:47,606
I'M 100% THAT BITCH."

166
00:12:47,606 --> 00:12:49,670
NUMBER ONE.

167
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:54,076
WELL, TO BE COMPLETELY HONEST,
I'M REALLY LIKE 50% THAT BITCH,

168
00:12:54,076 --> 00:12:55,836
10% BOSS BITCH,

169
00:12:55,836 --> 00:13:00,584
AND 40% FLUTE
PLAYING, BAND NERD BITCH.

170
00:13:03,099 --> 00:13:06,524
BUT I'M THRILLED TO BE HOSTING
THIS PARTICULAR EPISODE,

171
00:13:06,524 --> 00:13:11,134
ESPECIALLY BECAUSE I DO LOVE
TONIGHT'S MUSICAL GUEST.

172
00:13:11,134 --> 00:13:13,374
ME!

173
00:13:14,056 --> 00:13:17,898
NO, FOR REAL, I DO LOVE MYSELF.

174
00:13:17,898 --> 00:13:21,066
EVERYBODY SHOULD LOVE
THEMSELVES.

175
00:13:21,066 --> 00:13:26,514
YOU KNOW, AT EVERY SHOW, I TELL
MY AUDIENCE THE SAME THING, AND
I'LL TELL Y'ALL TOO.

176
00:13:26,514 --> 00:13:29,247
I LOVE YOU.
YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL.

177
00:13:29,247 --> 00:13:31,137
AND YOU CAN DO ANYTHING.

178
00:13:31,137 --> 00:13:33,352
I'M LIVING PROOF OF THAT.

179
00:13:33,464 --> 00:13:35,326
I USED TO LIVE IN MY CAR.

180
00:13:35,326 --> 00:13:40,438
NOW I'M UP HERE HOSTING
SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE.

181
00:13:41,211 --> 00:13:45,819
WE'VE GOT A GREAT SHOW
FOR YOU TONIGHT

182
00:13:45,819 --> 00:13:49,335
STICK AROUND WE'LL
BE RIGHT BACK

183
00:13:57,122 --> 00:14:02,000
TIME
HOST

184
00:14:05,312 --> 00:14:10,303
>> WELCOME TO "GUESS THAT!"
CLINT LITTERS.

185
00:14:10,303 --> 00:14:13,854
AND WE HAVE THREE WONDERFUL
CONTESTANTS PLAYING --

186
00:14:13,942 --> 00:14:17,532
TRACY,
NICOLE, AND KENNY.

187
00:14:17,532 --> 00:14:19,912
NOW, WE ALL KNOW HOW THE GAME
GOES.

188
00:14:19,912 --> 00:14:23,008
I'LL ASK YOU GUYS A SERIES OF
RAPID FIRE TRIVIA QUESTIONS,

189
00:14:23,116 --> 00:14:26,268
AND
IF YOU GET THEM RIGHT, I'LL GIVE
YOU SOME MONEY.
SOUND GOOD?

190
00:14:26,268 --> 00:14:28,293
>> YEAH, LET'S PLAY.
>> SOUNDS GREAT, CLINT.

191
00:14:28,293 --> 00:14:30,185
>> ALL RIGHT, LET'S START.

192
00:14:30,185 --> 00:14:34,237
FIRST QUESTION -- THIS AMINO
ACID FOUND IN TURKEY

193
00:14:34,237 --> 00:14:36,317
IS KNOWN TO
MAKE YOU SLEEPY.

194
00:14:36,317 --> 00:14:39,175
>> THAT WOULD BE TRYPTOPHAN,
CLINT.

195
00:14:39,386 --> 00:14:42,348
>> CORRECT.
$100 ON THE BOARD FOR TRACY.

196
00:14:42,357 --> 00:14:47,847
NEXT QUESTION.
THIS SURGERY USES LASER
TECHNOLOGY TO RESTORE VISION.

197
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:50,843
>> I'VE ACTUALLY HAD THIS, IT'S
LASIK SURGERY.

198
00:14:50,957 --> 00:14:53,478
>> YES.
THAT'S $100 FOR YOU, KENNY.

199
00:14:53,552 --> 00:14:56,501
OKAY.
THIS NEW YORK CITY AIRPORT

200
00:14:56,501 --> 00:15:00,779
WAS NAMED AFTER THE 35TH PRESIDENT
OF THE UNITED STATES.

201
00:15:00,779 --> 00:15:03,159
>> ROBERT KENNEDY AIRPORT.

202
00:15:03,244 --> 00:15:06,100
>> OH, SORRY, THAT'S ACTUALLY
INCORRECT.

203
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:07,807
>> NO, IT'S NOT!
I WAS JUST THERE.

204
00:15:07,807 --> 00:15:11,998
>> THAT'S STILL WRONG, NICOLE.

205
00:15:11,998 --> 00:15:15,591
>> HOW YOU GONE TELL ME?
I WAS JUST STUCK IN THAT AIRPORT FOR FIVE HOURS

206
00:15:15,591 --> 00:15:19,453
'CAUSE I PET A
BOMB-SNIFFING DOG AND THEY SAID
I RUINED HIM.

207
00:15:20,674 --> 00:15:23,785
>> THAT'S VERY CONFUSING TO
HEAR.

208
00:15:23,785 --> 00:15:27,327
KENNY?
>> IS IT JOHN F. KENNEDY
AIRPORT?

209
00:15:27,327 --> 00:15:28,671
>> THAT IS CORRECT.

210
00:15:28,671 --> 00:15:33,689
>> I -- I JUST SAID THAT.
>> UH, NO, YOU SAID "ROBERT
KENNEDY."

211
00:15:33,689 --> 00:15:35,905
>> OKAY, BUT YOU KNEW WHAT I
MEANT.

212
00:15:36,792 --> 00:15:39,962
>> OKAY, NICOLE.
WE HAVE A LOT MORE QUESTIONS.

213
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:42,451
SO, THAT'S $100 FOR YOU, KENNY.

214
00:15:42,451 --> 00:15:44,777
>> AND WHAT DO I GET?

215
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:47,345
>> YOU DON'T -- YOU DON'T GET
ANYTHING.

216
00:15:47,345 --> 00:15:50,645
>> I GAVE HIM HALF THE ANSWER,
SO I SHOULD GET HALF THE MONEY.

217
00:15:51,497 --> 00:15:53,518
>> WELL, THAT'S NOT HOW THE GAME
WORKS.

218
00:15:53,518 --> 00:15:57,273
>> OH, OKAY, SO THEY GIVE YOU A
LITTLE SUIT AND SOME BLUE CARDS

219
00:15:57,372 --> 00:16:00,006
AND NOW YOU'RE THE MAYOR OF GAME
TOWN?

220
00:16:00,006 --> 00:16:04,261
>> I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS,
BUT YOU'RE SLOWING UP THE GAME.

221
00:16:04,261 --> 00:16:09,066
ALL RIGHT.
NEXT QUESTION.
IN 1492, THIS EXPLORER --

222
00:16:09,066 --> 00:16:11,650
NICOLE, YOU HAVE AN ANSWER
ALREADY?

223
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:13,702
>> I DON'T WANNA PLAY NO MORE.

224
00:16:15,718 --> 00:16:20,293
>> WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
>> YOU SAID I CAN'T WIN, SO I
DON'T WANNA PLAY NO MORE.

225
00:16:20,293 --> 00:16:24,746
>> I NEVER SAID YOU CAN'T WIN.
>> UH-UH, DON'T GASLIGHT ME.

226
00:16:24,746 --> 00:16:28,087
>> WHO'S GASLIGHTING?
>> Y'ALL SEE THIS, RIGHT?

227
00:16:28,168 --> 00:16:31,327
IF HE WANT ME TO LOSE SO BAD,
WHY DON'T YOU JUST LET ME QUIT,
CLINT?

228
00:16:31,327 --> 00:16:34,241
>> ALL RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT.
QUIT.
I DON'T CARE.

229
00:16:34,317 --> 00:16:42,802
>> OKAY.

230
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:42,802
GIVE ME MY MONEY FIRST.

231
00:16:42,802 --> 00:16:45,372
>> WHAT MONEY?

232
00:16:42,802 --> 00:16:45,372
YOU HAVE A SCORE OF ZERO.

233
00:16:42,802 --> 00:16:45,372
>> WELL THEY SAY I GET $500 JUST

234
00:16:45,372 --> 00:16:47,073
FOR PLAYING.

235
00:16:45,372 --> 00:16:47,073
>> YEAH, THAT'S IF YOU FINISH

236
00:16:45,372 --> 00:16:47,073
THE GAME.

237
00:16:47,073 --> 00:16:51,678
>> OKAY, SO YOU'RE FORCING ME TO

238
00:16:47,073 --> 00:16:51,678
PLAY, EVEN THOUGH YOU SAID I

239
00:16:47,073 --> 00:16:51,678
CAN'T WIN.

240
00:16:51,678 --> 00:16:56,649
THIS MAN IS A CLASSIC

241
00:16:51,678 --> 00:16:56,649
GASLIGHTING NARCISSIST, Y'ALL.

242
00:16:51,678 --> 00:16:56,649
>> CAN I JUST FINISH ASKING THE

243
00:16:56,649 --> 00:17:03,923
QUESTIONS, NICOLE?

244
00:16:56,649 --> 00:17:03,923
>> GO AHEAD, BUT THAT HOTEL YOU

245
00:16:56,649 --> 00:17:03,923
PUT US IN IS NASTY.

246
00:17:03,923 --> 00:17:10,263
>> WELL, I'M SORRY YOU FEEL THAT

247
00:17:03,923 --> 00:17:10,263
WAY.

248
00:17:03,923 --> 00:17:10,263
IN 1492, THIS EXPLORER SET SAIL

249
00:17:10,263 --> 00:17:11,698
TO DISCOVER THE NEW WORLD.

250
00:17:10,263 --> 00:17:11,698
KENNY?

251
00:17:11,698 --> 00:17:13,867
>> CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS.

252
00:17:11,698 --> 00:17:13,867
>> YES.

253
00:17:13,867 --> 00:17:18,772
THAT IS CORRECT.

254
00:17:13,867 --> 00:17:18,772
THAT IS CORRECT.

255
00:17:13,867 --> 00:17:18,772
$100 FOR YOU, KENNY.

256
00:17:18,772 --> 00:17:27,380
NICOLE?

257
00:17:18,772 --> 00:17:27,380
>> CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS.

258
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:29,149
>> YEAH, HE ALREADY SAID THAT.

259
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:29,149
>> OKAY.

260
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:29,149
SO WHEN I REPEAT HIS ANSWER, I

261
00:17:29,149 --> 00:17:34,054
DON'T GET NO MONEY, BUT WHEN HE

262
00:17:29,149 --> 00:17:34,054
REPEAT MINE, HE GET $100?

263
00:17:29,149 --> 00:17:34,054
>> YOU GUESSED THE WRONG ANSWER,

264
00:17:34,054 --> 00:17:38,858
NICOLE.

265
00:17:34,054 --> 00:17:38,858
>> NO, YOU HATE WOMEN.

266
00:17:38,858 --> 00:17:41,828
>> YO, CAN I -- CAN I JUST GIVE

267
00:17:38,858 --> 00:17:41,828
HER 50 OF MY DOLLARS?

268
00:17:41,828 --> 00:17:43,430
>> YES.

269
00:17:41,828 --> 00:17:43,430
>> NO.

270
00:17:41,828 --> 00:17:43,430
THAT IS NOT HOW THE GAME WORKS.

271
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:51,438
AND STOP USING THE BUZZER EVERY

272
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:51,438
TIME YOU WANT TO SAY SOMETHING.

273
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:51,438
WHO DIED AND MADE YOU THE MAYOR

274
00:17:51,438 --> 00:17:55,308
OF GAME TOWN?

275
00:17:51,438 --> 00:17:55,308
>> GIRL, HE THINK HE THE MAYOR

276
00:17:51,438 --> 00:17:55,308
OF GAME TOWN JUST BECAUSE HE GOT

277
00:17:55,308 --> 00:18:00,480
A LITTLE SUIT AND A GUN.

278
00:17:55,308 --> 00:18:00,480
>> I DON'T HAVE A GUN.

279
00:17:55,308 --> 00:18:00,480
AND I'M NOT THE MAYOR OF

280
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,614
>> I DON'T HAVE A GUN.

281
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,614
AND I'M NOT THE MAYOR OF

282
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,614
ANYTHING.

283
00:18:06,019 --> 00:18:08,922
WHAT, NICOLE?

284
00:18:06,019 --> 00:18:08,922
>> WELL, IF YOU DON'T WANT TO BE

285
00:18:06,019 --> 00:18:08,922
THE MAYOR NO MORE, CAN I DO IT?

286
00:18:08,922 --> 00:18:10,023
>> NO!

287
00:18:08,922 --> 00:18:10,023
NO!

288
00:18:10,023 --> 00:18:12,158
>> OH, OKAY.

289
00:18:12,158 --> 00:18:13,426
>> OH, OKAY.

290
00:18:12,158 --> 00:18:13,426
SO, A WOMAN CAN'T BE A MAYOR OF

291
00:18:12,158 --> 00:18:13,426
GAME TOWN?

292
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:19,766
>> HOW YOU GONE BE THE MAYOR OF

293
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:19,766
GAME TOWN, YOU DON'T EVEN

294
00:18:19,766 --> 00:18:22,035
BELIEVE, BRO?

295
00:18:22,035 --> 00:18:23,870
>> 'CAUSE SEE, NOW I'M THE NEW

296
00:18:22,035 --> 00:18:23,870
MAYOR.

297
00:18:22,035 --> 00:18:23,870
AND THE FIRST THING I'M DOING IS

298
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:25,572
PUTTING US IN A BETTER HOTEL

299
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:25,572
WITH AN ESPRESSO MACHINE.

300
00:18:25,572 --> 00:18:31,678
>> YO, I LOVE THE NEW MAYOR, YO.

301
00:18:25,572 --> 00:18:31,678
>> LOOK.

302
00:18:25,572 --> 00:18:31,678
Y'ALL GONE BURN UP THE BATTERIES

00:18:31,678 --> 00:18:36,750
ON THEM BUZZERS.

304
00:18:31,678 --> 00:18:36,750
NOW, HAVE ANY OF Y'ALL EVER BEEN

305
00:18:31,678 --> 00:18:36,750
ON A GAME SHOW?

306
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:40,453
>> I WAS ON "PEOPLE'S COURT."

307
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:40,453
I BROKE INTO MY EX'S HOUSE AND

655
00:28:30,477 --> 00:28:32,512
>> I HAD AN AMAZING TIME AT

656
00:28:30,477 --> 00:28:32,512

FULL OF CHEESE.

659
00:28:32,512 --> 00:28:36,049
I FEEL LIKE I'M A LITTLE LUIGI.

660
00:28:36,049 --> 00:28:40,487
>> YOU ALREADY SAID THAT IN THE

661
00:28:36,049 --> 00:28:40,487
CAR.

662
00:28:36,049 --> 00:28:40,487
YOU KNOW, I USUALLY DON'T BRING

663
00:28:40,487 --> 00:28:44,424
GUYS HOME AFTER A FIRST DATE,

664
00:28:40,487 --> 00:28:44,424
BUT SOMETHING ABOUT THIS JUST

00:28:40,487 --> 00:28:44,424
FEELS RIGHT.

666
00:28:44,424 --> 00:28:49,362
>> YEAH.

667
00:28:44,424 --> 00:28:49,362
I FEEL THE SAME WAY.

668
00:28:44,424 --> 00:28:49,362
>> OH, BY THE WAY, I SHOULD

669
00:28:49,362 --> 00:28:54,067
MENTION, I LIVE HERE WITH MY

670
00:28:49,362 --> 00:28:54,067
GRANDPA.

671
00:28:49,362 --> 00:28:54,067
SORRY, I SHOULD HAVE SAID

672
00:28:54,067 --> 00:28:57,671
SOMETHING EARLIER.

673
00:28:54,067 --> 00:28:57,671
IF YOU WANT TO GO --

674
00:28:54,067 --> 00:28:57,671
>> OH, NO, NO.

675
00:28:57,671 --> 00:29:02,475
I MEAN, WHY WOULD I LEAVE?

676
00:28:57,671 --> 00:29:02,475
I THINK THAT'S REALLY SWEET.

677
00:28:57,671 --> 00:29:02,475
>> IS THAT MY GRANDDAUGHTER?

678
00:29:02,475 --> 00:29:11,785
>> OH, HI GRANDPA.

679
00:29:02,475 --> 00:29:11,785
>> I'M SORRY, I DIDN'T REALIZE

680
00:29:02,475 --> 00:29:11,785
WE HAD COMPANY.

681
00:29:11,785 --> 00:29:21,594
WELL, PRETEND LIKE I'M NOT EVEN

682
00:29:11,785 --> 00:29:21,594

683
00:29:11,785 --> 00:29:21,594
>> WHAT?

684
00:29:21,594 --> 00:29:36,376
THAT IS YOUR GRANDPA?

685
00:29:21,594 --> 00:29:36,376
>> DON'T MIND ME.

686
00:29:21,594 --> 00:29:36,376
>> I'LL LEAVE YOU KIDS TO IT.

687
00:29:36,376 --> 00:29:42,449
>> DON'T MIND ME.

688
00:29:36,376 --> 00:29:42,449
>> I'LL LEAVE YOU KIDS TO IT.

689
00:29:36,376 --> 00:29:42,449

691
00:29:52,892 --> 00:30:00,066
YOUR GRANDPA KIND OF THREW ME.

692
00:29:52,892 --> 00:30:00,066
>> I'D RATHER NOT MAKE IT A

693
00:30:00,066 --> 00:30:06,806
THING, BUT YEAH.

694
00:30:00,066 --> 00:30:06,806
MY GRANDPA'S WHITE.

695
00:30:00,066 --> 00:30:06,806
>> NO.

696
00:30:06,806 --> 00:30:12,379
I WAS REFERRING MORE TO THE FACT

699
00:30:12,379 --> 00:30:35,402
>> WOW.

>> I GOT MY BOILING HOT TEA.

701
00:30:12,379 --> 00:30:35,402
OH, I SPILLED MY TEA.

702
00:30:35,402 --> 00:30:36,903

I MEAN, WE COULD GO TO MY PLACE

708
00:30:39,406 --> 00:30:43,977
IF YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT US

709
00:30:39,406 --> 00:30:43,977
MAKING NOISE.

710
00:30:39,406 --> 00:30:43,977

718
00:31:02,362 --> 00:31:08,501

719

>> NO, NO.

722
00:31:08,501 --> 00:31:15,709
MY GRANDPA'S THE SIX FLAG GUY.

723
00:31:15,709 --> 00:31:19,379
SHE'S JUST A SIX FLAGS GUY.

THEIR FRIENDS.

748
00:32:10,230 --> 00:32:15,168
BUT DON'T WORRY, IT'S NOT WHAT

749
00:32:10,230 --> 00:32:15,168
YOU THINK.

750

>> YEAH, I FEEL LIKE IT IS GOING

751
00:32:15,168 --> 00:32:18,705
TO BE WHAT I THINK.

752
00:32:15,168 --> 00:32:18,705
>> COME ON IN, GUYS.

753

YOU WANT TO LEAVE?

WHY?

761
00:32:44,898 --> 00:32:51,504
BECAUSE MY GRANDPARENTS AND

THEIR WHOLE FRIEND GROUP ARE SIX

763

HERSELF.

1385
00:58:32,545 --> 00:58:35,248
THE INCOMPARABLE BEVERLY GAGS.

1386
00:58:35,248 --> 00:58:43,757

I'M A CONDUCTOR.

1389
00:58:43,757 --> 00:58:48,228
MS. GAGS, IS IT?

1390
00:58:43,757 --> 00:58:48,228

SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA.

1400
00:58:54,067 --> 00:58:59,406
WORD.

1401
00:58:59,406 --> 00:59:00,740

>> SO, SHE GOT THE PART?

1409
00:59:06,312 --> 00:59:11,584
>> WELL, SHE'S CLEARLY TALENTED,

1410
00:59:11,584 --> 00:59:21,461
BUT I JUST DON'T THINK SHE'S OUR

1411
00:59:11,584 --> 00:59:21,461
STYLE.

1412
00:59:11,584 --> 00:59:21,461
>> I DON'T KNOW, SIR, WE'RE IN

1413
00:59:21,461 --> 00:59:28,401
QUITE A BIND.

1414
00:59:21,461 --> 00:59:28,401

1415
00:59:21,461 --> 00:59:28,401
DON'T DO THIS.

1416
00:59:28,401 --> 00:59:32,672
>> WELL, WHEN YOU PUT IT THAT

1417
00:59:28,401 --> 00:59:32,672
WAY, I SUPPOSE WE CAN ALLOW A

1418
00:59:28,401 --> 00:59:32,672
QUICK AUDITION.

1419
00:59:32,672 --> 00:59:37,744
SO, TAKE YOUR SEAT.

1420
00:59:32,672 --> 00:59:37,744

1421
00:59:32,672 --> 00:59:37,744
YOU WON'T REGRET IT,

1422
00:59:37,744 --> 00:59:55,795
MR. CONDUCTOR.

1423
00:59:37,744 --> 00:59:55,795

>> WHY YOU STOPPING, JIM?

1428
00:59:59,799 --> 01:00:02,202
SHE WAS JUST GETTING IN THE

1429
00:59:59,799 --> 01:00:02,202
GROOVE?

1430
00:59:59,799 --> 01:00:02,202
>> OH, I DON'T KNOW.

1431
01:00:02,202 --> 01:00:08,341
MAYBE BECAUSE SHE WAS TWERKING

1432
01:00:02,202 --> 01:00:08,341
ON OUR BASSOONIST.

1433
01:00:02,202 --> 01:00:08,341
THIS IS A TRADITIONAL SYMPHONY.

1434
01:00:08,341 --> 01:00:14,981
YOU KNOW, ONE WHERE YOU SIT DOWN

1435
01:00:08,341 --> 01:00:14,981

SO, YOU WANT ME TO SIT DOWN ON

1438
01:00:14,981 --> 01:00:21,254
THE TWERK.

1439
01:00:14,981 --> 01:00:21,254
I GOT YOU.

NO.

1443
01:00:25,658 --> 01:00:34,501
NOBODY WANTS THAT.

1444
01:00:25,658 --> 01:00:34,501
>> I MEAN -- I WOULDN'T SAY

1445
01:00:25,658 --> 01:00:34,501
NOBODY.

>> GAGS.

1449
01:00:40,106 --> 01:00:56,690

1450
01:00:40,106 --> 01:00:56,690
NAME ENOUGH, OKAY?

1451
01:00:40,106 --> 01:00:56,690
>> I CAN'T DO THAT.

1452
01:00:56,690 --> 01:00:58,458
>> YEAH, SIR, THAT'S A TALL

1453
01:00:56,690 --> 01:00:58,458
ORDER, BUDDY.

1454
01:00:56,690 --> 01:00:58,458
>> HOW IS THAT A TALL ORDER?

1455
01:00:58,458 --> 01:01:00,660
YOU JUST SIT DOWN AND YOU PLAY A

1456
01:00:58,458 --> 01:01:00,660
SOLO.

1457
01:00:58,458 --> 01:01:00,660
>> IF YOU SAY SO.

1458
01:01:00,660 --> 01:01:07,367
>> STOP.

1459
01:01:00,660 --> 01:01:07,367
STOP.

1460
01:01:07,367 --> 01:01:13,306
WHAT WAS THAT?

1461
01:01:07,367 --> 01:01:13,306
YOU WERE PLAYING SO WELL BEFORE.

1462
01:01:07,367 --> 01:01:13,306
>> WELL, SIR, THE TRUTH IS --

1463
01:01:13,306 --> 01:01:16,176

THANKS, GIRL.

1465
01:01:13,306 --> 01:01:16,176
THE TRUTH IS THE ONLY WAY I CAN

1466
01:01:16,176 --> 01:01:18,778
PLAY THE FLUTE IS IF I'M

1467
01:01:16,176 --> 01:01:18,778
TWERKING.

1468
01:01:16,176 --> 01:01:18,778
SEE, TWO YEARS AGO, I COULDN'T

1469
01:01:18,778 --> 01:01:25,151
PLAY ANY INSTRUMENT.

1470
01:01:18,778 --> 01:01:25,151
AND THEN ONE DAY LAST SUMMER,

1471
01:01:18,778 --> 01:01:25,151
THE ICE CREAM TRUCK PULLED UP,

1472
01:01:25,151 --> 01:01:29,556
AND I HEARD THAT JINGLE.

1473
01:01:25,151 --> 01:01:29,556
AND THAT BEAT HAD MY BODY MOVING

1474
01:01:25,151 --> 01:01:29,556
IN WAYS THAT MADE ME FEEL

1475
01:01:29,556 --> 01:01:37,897
POWERFUL, LIKE I COULD DO

1476
01:01:29,556 --> 01:01:37,897
ANYTHING, EVEN PLAY THE FLUTE.

1477
01:01:29,556 --> 01:01:37,897
AND THE REST IS HISTORY.

1478
01:01:37,897 --> 01:01:43,603
>> WELL, I'M SORRY, BUT THIS IS

1479
01:01:37,897 --> 01:01:43,603
OUR FINAL PERFORMANCE OF THE

1480
01:01:37,897 --> 01:01:43,603
SEASON, AND IT WILL BE JUST TOO

1481
01:01:43,603 --> 01:01:48,942
DISTRACTING IF SOMEONE IS

1482
01:01:43,603 --> 01:01:48,942
TWERKING.

1483
01:01:43,603 --> 01:01:48,942
>> WELL, THEN, WHAT IF WE ALL

1484
01:01:48,942 --> 01:01:55,548
ARE TWERKING?

1485
01:01:48,942 --> 01:01:55,548
>> WHAT?

1486
01:01:48,942 --> 01:01:55,548
>> WE ARE THE DEVRY INSTITUTE

1487
01:01:55,548 --> 01:02:02,122
ORCHESTRA.

1488
01:01:55,548 --> 01:02:02,122
WE CAN DO THIS TOGETHER.

1489
01:01:55,548 --> 01:02:02,122
AND IF THAT MEANS I HAVE TO POP

1490
01:02:02,122 --> 01:02:25,278
THIS BOOTY FOR BEETHOVEN, THEN

1491
01:02:02,122 --> 01:02:25,278
SO BE IT.

1492
01:02:02,122 --> 01:02:25,278
**

1493
01:02:39,859 --> 01:02:46,966
>>> MAY THE NEXT CHAPTER BE AS

1494
01:02:39,859 --> 01:02:46,966
EXCITING AS THE LAST.

1495
01:02:39,859 --> 01:02:46,966
>> THANKS, BUDDY.

1496
01:02:47,834 --> 01:02:55,442
>> STILL CAN'T BELIEVE I FINALLY

1497
01:02:47,834 --> 01:02:55,442
QUIT MY JOB.

1498
01:02:47,834 --> 01:02:55,442
I REALIZED WHY AM I WASTING MY

1499
01:02:55,442 --> 01:03:00,347
LIFE AT A JOB I HATE WHEN I

1500
01:02:55,442 --> 01:03:00,347
DON'T HAVE TO WORK.

1501
01:02:55,442 --> 01:03:00,347
SO, I TOLD MY BOSS I QUIT.

1502
01:03:00,347 --> 01:03:05,318
>> I'M SO GLAD HE DID.

1503
01:03:00,347 --> 01:03:05,318
NOW WE CAN FINALLY START LIVING

1504
01:03:00,347 --> 01:03:05,318
OUR LIVES.

1505
01:03:05,318 --> 01:03:11,491
>> SO, WHAT'S THE PLAN?

1506
01:03:05,318 --> 01:03:11,491
WHAT'S NEXT?

1507
01:03:05,318 --> 01:03:11,491
>> EUROPE, BRAZIL, YOU NAME IT.

1508
01:03:11,491 --> 01:03:16,396
AND AS FAR AS MONEY GOES, WE'RE

1509
01:03:11,491 --> 01:03:16,396
NOT WORRIED.

1510
01:03:11,491 --> 01:03:16,396
STEVE HAS HIS INVESTMENTS.

1511
01:03:16,396 --> 01:03:23,370
>> INVESTING.

1512
01:03:16,396 --> 01:03:23,370
I GOT TO GET INTO THAT.

1513
01:03:16,396 --> 01:03:23,370
>> YOU MUST, PAUL.

1514
01:03:23,370 --> 01:03:26,473
FINANCIAL SAFETY IS SO

1515
01:03:23,370 --> 01:03:26,473
IMPORTANT.

1516
01:03:23,370 --> 01:03:26,473
YOU HAVE TO MAKE YOUR MONEY WORK

1517
01:03:26,473 --> 01:03:33,213
FOR YOU.

1518
01:03:26,473 --> 01:03:33,213
YOU CAN INVEST IN A FUND, A

1519
01:03:26,473 --> 01:03:33,213
BUSINESS OR, IN MY CASE, I HAVE

1520
01:03:33,213 --> 01:03:40,687
MY BEANIE BABIES.

1521
01:03:33,213 --> 01:03:40,687
>> OH.

1522
01:03:33,213 --> 01:03:40,687
WOW.

1523
01:03:40,687 --> 01:03:47,227
>> I'M HOLDING ON TO THESE BAD

1524
01:03:40,687 --> 01:03:47,227
BOYS SINCE 1993 AND MY FRIENDS

1525
01:03:40,687 --> 01:03:47,227
ARE, IT'S TIME TO CASH IN.

1526
01:03:47,227 --> 01:03:51,765
>> NEEDLESS TO SAY, WE WON'T BE

1527
01:03:47,227 --> 01:03:51,765
WORRYING ABOUT MONEY FOR QUITE

1528
01:03:47,227 --> 01:03:51,765
SOME TIME.

1529
01:03:51,765 --> 01:03:58,538
>> THAT IS REALLY COOL.

1530
01:03:51,765 --> 01:03:58,538
BUT YOU KNOW THOUGH, I THINK I

1531
01:03:51,765 --> 01:03:58,538
HEARD A LOT OF BEANIE BABIES

1532
01:03:58,538 --> 01:04:05,679
AREN'T ACTUALLY WORTH THAT MUCH.

1533
01:03:58,538 --> 01:04:05,679
>> HOW DO YOU MEAN?

1534
01:03:58,538 --> 01:04:05,679
>> I MEAN, YES, THEY'RE

1535
01:04:05,679 --> 01:04:12,419
ESSENTIALLY WORTHLESS.

1536
01:04:05,679 --> 01:04:12,419
>> HUH.

1537
01:04:05,679 --> 01:04:12,419
ALL OF THEM?

1538
01:04:12,419 --> 01:04:21,795
>> MOST.

1539
01:04:12,419 --> 01:04:21,795
>> HUH.

1540
01:04:12,419 --> 01:04:21,795
GOD DAM IT.

1541
01:04:21,795 --> 01:04:29,302
>> THAT WAS OUR SAVINGS.

1542
01:04:21,795 --> 01:04:29,302
>> IT WAS WORTHLESS.

1543
01:04:21,795 --> 01:04:29,302
DON'T YOU SEE MY LIFE'S WORK IS

1544
01:04:29,302 --> 01:04:37,110
WORTHLESS.

1545
01:04:29,302 --> 01:04:37,110
>> YOU HAVE CAN GO TO YOUR JOB.

1546
01:04:29,302 --> 01:04:37,110
>> I CAN'T BECAUSE I BENT OVER,

1547
01:04:37,110 --> 01:04:42,549
GRAB MY CHEEKS AND PUFFTED THEM

1548
01:04:37,110 --> 01:04:42,549
LIKE HE COULD HAVE DONE IN THE

1549
01:04:37,110 --> 01:04:42,549
POCKETS.

1550
01:04:42,549 --> 01:04:46,553
I WENT SOMETHING LIKE SCREW YOU

1551
01:04:42,549 --> 01:04:46,553
GUYS, I'M OUT OF HERE.

1552
01:04:42,549 --> 01:04:46,553
>> THAT'S TERRIBLE.

1553
01:04:46,553 --> 01:04:51,891
>> I KNOW.

1554
01:04:46,553 --> 01:04:51,891
>> WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO,

1555
01:04:46,553 --> 01:04:51,891
STEVE?

1556
01:04:51,891 --> 01:04:56,963
WE'RE GOING TO LOSE THE HOUSE.

1557
01:04:51,891 --> 01:04:56,963
>> MAYBE I START DRAWING MARIO

1558
01:04:51,891 --> 01:04:56,963
FULL TIME.

1559
01:04:56,963 --> 01:05:01,434
LAST WEEK I DREW YOU A MARIO.

1560
01:04:56,963 --> 01:05:01,434
IO SAID IT WAS THE BEST ONE YOU

1561
01:04:56,963 --> 01:05:01,434
HAD EVER SEEN.

1562
01:05:01,434 --> 01:05:09,275
>> IT WAS.

1563
01:05:01,434 --> 01:05:09,275
IT WAS BETTER THAN THE ACTUAL

1564
01:05:01,434 --> 01:05:09,275
MARIO BUT DRAWING MARIO ISN'T A

1565
01:05:09,275 --> 01:05:14,280
DRAW, STEVE.

1566
01:05:09,275 --> 01:05:14,280
>> SOMEBODY SOMEWHERE IS DRAWING

1567
01:05:09,275 --> 01:05:14,280
MARIO.

1568
01:05:14,280 --> 01:05:19,486
DO YOU EXPECT ME TO BELIEVE

1569
01:05:14,280 --> 01:05:19,486
NINTENDO HAS NO INTEREST IN THE

1570
01:05:14,280 --> 01:05:19,486
MAN WHO DID THIS?

1571
01:05:19,486 --> 01:05:24,691
>> I'M SORRY.

1572
01:05:19,486 --> 01:05:24,691
BUT THAT ISN'T REALLY A VERY

1573
01:05:19,486 --> 01:05:24,691
GOOD MARIO.

1574
01:05:24,691 --> 01:05:29,195
>> IS THAT LOUIGI?

1575
01:05:24,691 --> 01:05:29,195
>> YOU DON'T HAVE FOOLIE.

1576
01:05:24,691 --> 01:05:29,195
IT'S AN OBJECTIVELY PERFECT

1577
01:05:29,195 --> 01:05:37,504
MARIO.

1578
01:05:29,195 --> 01:05:37,504
>> BETTER THAN THE ACTUAL MARIO.

1579
01:05:29,195 --> 01:05:37,504
>> BUT STEVE, THERE'S SOMETHING

1580
01:05:37,504 --> 01:05:44,711
I NEED TO TELL YOU.

1581
01:05:37,504 --> 01:05:44,711
I SHOULDN'T BE DRINKING THAT.

1582
01:05:37,504 --> 01:05:44,711
THE REASON I'M WORRIED ABOUT

1583
01:05:44,711 --> 01:05:51,584
MONEY IS BECAUSE YOU'RE GOING TO

1584
01:05:44,711 --> 01:05:51,584
BE A DADDY.

1585
01:05:44,711 --> 01:05:51,584
>> MY GOD.

1586
01:05:51,584 --> 01:05:58,625
I'M GOING TO BE A DADDY?

1587
01:05:51,584 --> 01:05:58,625
BABY, I LOVE YOU SO MUCH.

1588
01:05:51,584 --> 01:05:58,625
>> I LOVE YOU TOO.

1589
01:06:28,154 --> 01:06:29,789
>>> TONIGHT WAS THE BEST NIGHT

1590
01:06:28,154 --> 01:06:29,789
EVER.

1591
01:06:29,789 --> 01:06:32,926
>>> THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE

1592
01:06:29,789 --> 01:06:32,926
CAST AND CREW.

1593
01:06:29,789 --> 01:06:32,926
THANK YOU, ME.

1594
01:06:32,926 --> 01:06:36,763

GOOD NIGHT, EVERYBODY!

1596
01:06:36,763 --> 01:06:43,737
