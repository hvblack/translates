1
00:00:02,392 --> 00:00:04,431
>>> LIVE FROM CENTRAL PARK,

2
00:00:04,431 --> 00:00:08,328
IT'S
THE FIRST WARM DAY OF THE YEAR
ARRIVALS SHOW.

3
00:00:10,929 --> 00:00:15,126
>> WELL, FOLKS, IT'S MID APRIL
HERE IN NEW YORK CITY,

4
00:00:15,126 --> 00:00:17,645
AND THE
TEMPERATURE HIT 90 DEGREES THIS WEEK,

5
00:00:17,645 --> 00:00:19,879
A FULL TWO MONTHS AHEAD OF
SCHEDULE.

6
00:00:19,879 --> 00:00:23,049
WHILE THAT MAY BE TERRIFYING ON
A CLIMATE LEVEL,

7
00:00:23,049 --> 00:00:25,916
THE WARM
WEATHER CAN ONLY MEAN ONE THING.

8
00:00:25,916 --> 00:00:31,013
ALL THE FREAKS, CRAZIES, AND
WEIRDOS ARE HEADED TO CENTRAL
PARK.

9
00:00:31,013 --> 00:00:35,637
AND WE'RE EXPECTED TO SEE SOME
ICONIC PARK PEOPLE TODAY, AREN'T
WE, JACE?

10
00:00:35,637 --> 00:00:38,776
>> WE SURE ARE.
THE MOOD HERE IS ELECTRIC.

11
00:00:38,776 --> 00:00:42,472
THE SMELL OF HORSE MANURE IS IN
THE AIR.

12
00:00:42,473 --> 00:00:46,132
ICON

13
00:00:46,132 --> 00:00:49,153
OLDER MAN DOING AN AGGRESSIVE
POWER WALK.

14
00:00:49,153 --> 00:00:50,137
>> HI THERE.

15
00:00:50,137 --> 00:00:53,173
>> FIRST, DISH ON THIS OUTFIT.
>> CERTAINLY.

16
00:00:53,173 --> 00:00:56,230
I'M WEARING THE TIGHTEST SPANDEX
SHIRT OF ALL TIME,

17
00:00:56,230 --> 00:01:00,716
LITTLE
SHORTS, AND A WEIRD HEART RATE
MONITOR STRAPPED TO MY ARM.

18
00:01:00,716 --> 00:01:03,434
>> ICONIC.
CAN YOU GIVE US A PREVIEW OF
YOUR WALK?

19
00:01:03,434 --> 00:01:07,922
>> ABSOLUTELY.
BEHIND YOU, BEHIND YOU, BEHIND YOU,

20
00:01:07,922 --> 00:01:10,898
ON YOUR
LEFT, BEHIND YOU.
AND THERE IT IS.

21
00:01:10,898 --> 00:01:13,686
>> WOW, GORGEOUS.
DANA.

22
00:01:13,686 --> 00:01:16,261
>> WELL, JACE, I AM STAR STRUCK RIGHT NOW

23
00:01:16,261 --> 00:01:20,233
AS I AM JOINED BY NOT
ONE BUT TWO PERVERTS

24
00:01:20,233 --> 00:01:22,595
WHO CAME TO
THE PARK TO PLEASURE THEMSELVES.

25
00:01:22,595 --> 00:01:24,465
>> NICE TO BE OUT OF THE SUBWAY.

26
00:01:24,465 --> 00:01:27,224
>> EXCITED FOR THE BIG DAY?

27
00:01:27,224 --> 00:01:29,963
>> OH, YEAH.
I GOT MY MODESTY BLANKET AND BY
KNOCK LARS,

28
00:01:29,963 --> 00:01:31,660
SO I'M GOOD TO GO.

29
00:01:31,661 --> 00:01:34,293
POLICE

30
00:01:34,293 --> 00:01:38,894
>> YOU KNOW WHERE TO FIND YOUR
BOYS, THIS IS BUSHES, BABY.

31
00:01:39,172 --> 00:01:42,607
>> ANY NEW TECHNIQUES THIS YEAR?
>> OH, JUST ONE.

32
00:01:42,607 --> 00:01:47,425
>> IS THAT A FAKE ARM?
>> YEAH.

33
00:01:47,425 --> 00:01:49,882
>> WOW!
SHAME ON YOU BOTH.

34
00:01:49,882 --> 00:01:51,273
JACE.

35
00:01:51,273 --> 00:01:53,522
>> WELL, WE WERE HOPING SHE
WOULD MAKE AN APPEARANCE.

36
00:01:53,522 --> 00:01:55,905
IT'S A WOMAN LEARNING TO ROLLER
BLADE.

37
00:01:55,905 --> 00:01:58,899
>> YEAH.
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO LEARN, AND
I THOUGHT WHAT BETTER PLACE

38
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:01,530
THAN
ON A CROWDED PATHWAY FILLED WITH
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE.

39
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:03,943
>> HORRIBLE PLAN.
LET'S SEE WHAT YOU GOT.

40
00:02:03,943 --> 00:02:06,632
>> HERE I GO.

41
00:02:06,632 --> 00:02:09,166
>> AND SHE FELL RIGHT AWAY.
DANA.

42
00:02:09,166 --> 00:02:13,183
>> WELL, LOOK WHO I FOUND.
TWO OF CENTRAL PARK'S FINEST.

43
00:02:13,183 --> 00:02:15,964
PARK EMPLOYEES WHO DO NOT CARE
ABOUT THEIR JOBS.

44
00:02:15,964 --> 00:02:20,045
HOW YOU GUYS FEELING?
>> WE ARE VERY HIGH RIGHT NOW.
YES.

45
00:02:20,045 --> 00:02:21,212
THANK YOU FOR ASKING.

46
00:02:21,212 --> 00:02:25,642
>> AMAZING.
ANY WARNINGS FOR THOSE WHO
VIOLATE PARK RULES?

47
00:02:25,642 --> 00:02:28,095
>> YOU DO YOU.

48
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:30,362
>> INSPIRING WORDS.

49
00:02:30,362 --> 00:02:33,933
JACE, I HEAR YOU'VE SPOTTED AN
ABSOLUTE LEGEND.

50
00:02:33,933 --> 00:02:35,923
>> WELL, I HOPE SHE'LL STOP TO
TALK.

51
00:02:35,923 --> 00:02:38,328
IT'S A LADY TRYING TO TELL
SOMEONE WHERE SHE IS.

52
00:02:38,328 --> 00:02:40,687
>> WELL, I DON'T SEE YOU, BITCH.

53
00:02:40,687 --> 00:02:42,936
I'M RIGHT WHERE I SAID I WOULD
BE.

54
00:02:42,936 --> 00:02:46,587
RIGHT BY THE BIG TREE, THE BIG
TREE NEAR THE BRIDGE.

55
00:02:46,587 --> 00:02:49,282
>> OH, JUST MISSED HER.
DANA.

56
00:02:49,282 --> 00:02:51,913
>> HE'S BACK.

57
00:02:51,913 --> 00:02:55,255
IT'S THE GROWN MAN WITH THE
DRONE WHO'S ALONE.

58
00:02:55,255 --> 00:02:56,453
>> HEY, THERE.

59
00:02:56,453 --> 00:03:01,495
>> AND YOU WON'T BE FILMING
GIRLS LAYING OUT SUN BATHING,
WILL YOU?

60
00:03:04,359 --> 00:03:07,890
>> NO.
>> I DON'T BELIEVE YOU.

61
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:13,171
NOW, JACE, THIS GUY IS BAD, BUT
I HEAR YOU'RE WITH ONE OF THE
WORST PARK PEOPLE OF ALL.

62
00:03:13,171 --> 00:03:16,074
>> I SURE AM.
IT'S THE GUY WITH THE CLIPBOARD

63
00:03:16,074 --> 00:03:19,174
WHO WANTS TO KNOW IF YOU HAVE A
SECOND FOR A GOOD CAUSE.

64
00:03:19,174 --> 00:03:22,938
NOW, PEOPLE ABSOLUTELY HATE YOU.
CAN YOU TELL US WHY?

65
00:03:22,938 --> 00:03:28,126
>> WELL, I THINK IT'S BECAUSE I
ZERO IN ON FOLKS TRYING TO ENJOY
THEMSELVES AND PESTER THEM FOR
MONEY.

66
00:03:28,126 --> 00:03:31,268
>> ABSOLUTELY.
CAN WE SEE THAT IN ACTION?
>> YOU BET.

67
00:03:31,268 --> 00:03:33,310
WOW.
COOL SHIRT.

68
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:37,733
YOU HAVE A SECOND FOR --
>> NO!
I DONATED BEFORE.

69
00:03:37,733 --> 00:03:40,630
>> WHAT AN ABSOLUTE PAIN IN THE
ASS.
DANA.

70
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:42,805
>> IT'S A BIRD, IT'S A PLANE.

71
00:03:42,805 --> 00:03:45,321
IT'S A CRAZY MAN WITH A
MICROPHONE.

72
00:03:45,321 --> 00:03:47,427
>> GOOD TO BE BACK FOR ANOTHER
YEAR.

73
00:03:47,427 --> 00:03:51,070
>> AND I SEE YOU BROUGHT A LADY
FRIEND WITH YOU.

74
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:55,242
>> I SURE DID.
THIS WOMAN WILL BE DEBATING THE
NONSENSE THAT I SCREAM

75
00:03:55,242 --> 00:03:58,051
AS IF I'M
A RATIONAL MAN WHOSE MIND CAN BE
CHANGED.

76
00:03:58,051 --> 00:03:59,912
>> CAN WE GET A PREVIEW?

77
00:03:59,912 --> 00:04:01,780
>> OF COURSE.
>> OUR PLEASURE.

78
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:04,169
>> CREATED THE
CORONAVIRUS.

79
00:04:04,169 --> 00:04:05,778
>> THAT IS BOLOGNA!

80
00:04:05,779 --> 00:04:07,452
5G

81
00:04:07,452 --> 00:04:09,265
IMPOSSIBLE

82
00:04:09,265 --> 00:04:10,753
LIKE THAT

83
00:04:10,753 --> 00:04:14,193
>> WOW.
I CAN'T TELL WHO ANNOYS ME MORE.

84
00:04:14,193 --> 00:04:15,032
JACE.

85
00:04:15,032 --> 00:04:17,173
>> WELL, WE HAVE BEEN WAITING
FOR HER TO ARRIVE.

86
00:04:17,173 --> 00:04:19,519
IT'S WEALTHY WOMAN AND CHILD.

87
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:22,291
I FOUGHT TO ASK, WHAT'S THE PLAN
TODAY?

88
00:04:22,291 --> 00:04:24,749
>> I'M TAKING RILEY HERE TO THE PLAYGROUND

89
00:04:24,749 --> 00:04:29,064
WHERE I'LL SNAP INTO
AN IMMEDIATE PANIC IF I LOSE
SIGHT OF HIM FOR ONE SECOND.

90
00:04:29,064 --> 00:04:32,424
RILEY?
RILEY!

91
00:04:32,424 --> 00:04:33,786
>> OH, NO.

92
00:04:33,786 --> 00:04:36,141
>> WELL, I STILL DON'T SEE YOU.

93
00:04:36,141 --> 00:04:39,475
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M DONE LOOKING FOR YOU, BITCH.
YOU COME FIND ME.

94
00:04:39,475 --> 00:04:43,473
I'LL BE IN THE GRASS IN A RED
BIKINI GETTING MYSELF SOME SUN.

95
00:04:43,473 --> 00:04:47,388
>> WELL, WE'VE GOT PLENTY MORE
PARK PEOPLE COMING UP,

96
00:04:47,388 --> 00:04:51,036
INCLUDING
A WOMAN WITH AN OUT OF CONTROL DOG

97
00:04:51,036 --> 00:04:54,033
AND A PERFORMANCE FROM SOME
A-HOLE PLAYING AT ACOUSTIC GUITAR.

98
00:04:54,033 --> 00:04:55,770
AND LIVE --

99
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:57,682
>> OKAY.
GIRL, I'M RIGHT HERE.

100
00:04:57,682 --> 00:05:01,312
>> LIVE FROM NEW YORK, IT'S
SATURDAY NIGHT!

101
00:07:04,361 --> 00:07:09,501
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, ANA de
ARMAS!

102
00:07:26,764 --> 00:07:30,330
>>> GRACIAS.
GRACIAS.

103
00:07:36,575 --> 00:07:38,586
JUST KIDDING.

104
00:07:38,586 --> 00:07:40,721
I SPEAK ENGLISH.

105
00:07:41,043 --> 00:07:43,825
BUT I DIDN'T WHEN I FIRST GOT TO
THE U.S.

106
00:07:43,825 --> 00:07:47,803
I WAS BORN IN CUBA, CAME TO
AMERICA WHEN I WAS

107
00:07:47,803 --> 00:07:53,268
26, AND I
LEARNED ENGLISH THE WAY EVERYONE
WHO COMES TO THIS COUNTRY DOES,

108
00:07:53,268 --> 00:07:55,274
BY WATCHING "FRIENDS."

109
00:07:55,274 --> 00:07:59,752
WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THE BEST
ENGLISH TUTOR WOULD HAVE BEEN
CHANDLER BING.

110
00:07:59,752 --> 00:08:04,060
LOOK AT ME NOW, COULD I BE ANY
BETTER AT ENGLISH?

111
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:08,110
ACTING HERE WAS DIFFICULT AT FIRST

112
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:10,796
BECAUSE I DIDN'T ALWAYS
UNDERSTAND WHAT I WAS SAYING.

113
00:08:10,796 --> 00:08:14,170
THEN I MET A GUY WHO HAD A CLASS
CALLED HOW TO AUDITION,

114
00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:17,145
WHICH
WAS DEFINITELY A SCAM.

115
00:08:17,145 --> 00:08:19,135
HE HAD ME READ A SCENE,

116
00:08:19,135 --> 00:08:22,004
AND THERE WAS THIS LINE, I BEG YOUR
PARDON.

117
00:08:22,004 --> 00:08:24,431
BUT I HAD NEVER SEEN OR HEARD THAT PHRASE,

118
00:08:24,431 --> 00:08:27,713
SO I THOUGHT THIS
CHARACTER WAS LITERALLY BEGGING.

119
00:08:27,713 --> 00:08:32,721
SO WHEN I DID THE LINE, I SAID,
I BEG YOUR PARDON!
GIVE IT TO ME!

120
00:08:32,721 --> 00:08:36,089
THEN SOMEONE ELSE IN THE CLASS
READ THE LINE, AND I WAS LIKE,

121
00:08:36,089 --> 00:08:39,642
OH, CAN I TRY AGAIN?

122
00:08:39,804 --> 00:08:42,447
THIS HAS BEEN A MAGICAL YEAR.

123
00:08:42,447 --> 00:08:45,774
NOT ONLY I WAS NOMINATED FOR AN
OSCAR --

124
00:08:48,943 --> 00:08:54,088
BUT IN THREE WEEKS, I'M GOING
OFFICIALLY BECOME AN AMERICAN
CITIZEN.

125
00:08:56,455 --> 00:08:58,684
I AM PROUD TO BECOME A CITIZEN

126
00:08:58,684 --> 00:09:03,046
BECAUSE WHEN I MOVED HERE,
EVERYONE WAS SO WELCOMING.

127
00:09:03,046 --> 00:09:06,850
WHEN I DID MY FIRST MOVIE IN THE
U.S. CALLED HANDS OF STONE,

128
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:08,774
I
GOT TO WORK WITH ROBERT DE NIRO,

129
00:09:08,774 --> 00:09:12,190
AND ONE DAY ON SET, HE SAID HE
WAS GOING TO CUBA SOON,

130
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:15,757
AND IF I
DO, I'LL SAY HELLO TO YOUR
FAMILY.

131
00:09:15,757 --> 00:09:18,331
HE ASKED ME FOR THEIR PHONE
NUMBER.

132
00:09:18,331 --> 00:09:20,137
I COMPLETELY FORGOT ABOUT IT,

133
00:09:20,137 --> 00:09:24,340
AND ONE DAY I GET A PHONE CALL
FROM MY DAD, HE'S HYSTERICAL,

134
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:26,529
AND I GO, DAD, WHAT'S WRONG,

135
00:09:26,529 --> 00:09:30,142
AND HE GOES, ROBERT DE NIRO JUST
CAME TO VISIT ME AT WORK.

136
00:09:30,307 --> 00:09:33,499
THAT WAS SUCH A KIND GESTURE,

137
00:09:33,499 --> 00:09:37,781
AND I HAVE BEEN SO FORTUNATE TO
WORK WITH SO MANY WONDERFUL
ACTORS.

138
00:09:37,781 --> 00:09:40,282
MY DAD WAS SO PROUD OF ME,

139
00:09:40,282 --> 00:09:44,811
AND HE WOULD BE PROUD TO SEE ME
TODAY STANDING ON THIS STAGE.

140
00:09:44,811 --> 00:09:46,998
I FEEL VERY LUCKY TO BE HERE.

141
00:09:46,998 --> 00:09:51,592
I REMEMBER THE FIRST TIME MY
NAME WAS IN THE NEW YORK CROSS
WORD.

142
00:09:51,592 --> 00:09:55,210
EVERYONE TEXTED ME, AND THEY
SAID, YOU MADE IT.

143
00:09:55,210 --> 00:09:56,656
AND I THOUGHT I DID.

144
00:09:56,656 --> 00:09:59,663
BUT THEN, A COUPLE MONTHS AGO,
SNL CALLED ME AND SAID,

145
00:09:59,663 --> 00:10:01,292
ANA, WE
WANT YOU TO HOST.

146
00:10:01,292 --> 00:10:04,956
AND I WAS SO SHOCKED AND EXCITED
THAT ALL I COULD SAY WAS --

147
00:10:04,956 --> 00:10:07,418
I
BEG YOUR PARDON!

148
00:10:07,418 --> 00:10:11,472
WE HAVE A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU
TONIGHT.
KAROL G IS HERE.

149
00:10:11,472 --> 00:10:14,272
STICK AROUND.

>> I THINK I DO.

241
00:13:05,455 --> 00:13:07,689
HE OBVIOUSLY GAVE HER A KIDNEY

242
00:13:07,691 --> 00:13:08,823
AND SAVED HER LIFE.

243
00:13:08,825 --> 00:13:10,725
>> HE DIDN'T GIVE ME A KIDNEY.

244

>> NO.

248
00:13:17,167 --> 00:13:23,204

WHEN HE STANDS IT'S A FOUR.

250
00:13:25,609 --> 00:13:28,009

251
00:13:28,011 --> 00:13:28,776
GETS SMALLER?

252
00:13:28,778 --> 00:13:29,477
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

253
00:13:29,479 --> 00:13:30,678

LOOK AT MY HUSBAND.

259
00:13:39,356 --> 00:13:41,556

260
00:13:41,558 --> 00:13:41,956
WITH HIM.

261
00:13:41,958 --> 00:13:43,892
>> THE JUDGES SAY NO.

262
00:13:43,894 --> 00:13:44,792
>> I'M SORRY.

263
00:13:44,794 --> 00:13:47,328

FIRST QUESTION GOES TO YOU.

SOMETHING ABOUT THE WORD TRANS

1094

1104
00:48:51,529 --> 00:48:53,929
AND ALSO, MY LEGS ARE GOING

1105
00:48:53,931 --> 00:48:55,464
NUMB, AND I MIGHT PASS OUT.

1106
00:48:55,466 --> 00:48:56,999
>> HOW LONG WERE YOU HANGING UP

1107
00:48:57,001 --> 00:48:57,299
THERE?

1108
00:48:57,301 --> 00:48:58,801

00:48:58,803 --> 00:48:59,101
LIKED.

1110
00:48:59,103 --> 00:49:01,303
I TRIED TO CALL DOWN, BUT NO ONE

1111
00:49:01,305 --> 00:49:02,138
COULD HEAR ME.

1112
00:49:02,140 --> 00:49:04,774
AT ONE POINT, I HEARD A CREW GUY

1113
00:49:04,776 --> 00:49:06,842
SAY, IS SHE GONNA DIE UP THERE.

1114
00:49:06,844 --> 00:49:08,444
AND THEN ANOTHER GUY WAS LIKE,

1115
00:49:08,446 --> 00:49:11,981
YOU MEAN, ARE THEY GONNA DIE UP

1116
00:49:11,983 --> 00:49:12,381
THERE.

1117
00:49:12,383 --> 00:49:15,751
AND THEN THEY BOTH WALKED AWAY

1118
00:49:15,753 --> 00:49:17,586
AND DIDN'T HELP, WHICH FEELS A

1119
00:49:17,588 --> 00:49:20,656
LOT LIKE HOW TRANSPEOPLE ARE

1120
00:49:20,658 --> 00:49:21,257
BEING TREATED RIGHT NOW.

1121
00:49:21,259 --> 00:49:21,891
BUT DON'T WORRY.

1122
00:49:21,893 --> 00:49:25,061
WE HAVE A CODE WORD FOR

1123
00:49:25,063 --> 00:49:26,962
EMERGENCIES, AND IT WAS

1124
00:49:26,964 --> 00:49:27,363
TRANSRIGHTS.

1125
00:49:27,365 --> 00:49:29,031
OH, MY GOSH.

1126
00:49:29,033 --> 00:49:30,099
GOOD GOLLY!

1127
00:49:30,101 --> 00:49:32,702
THAT WAS THE CODE FOR CONFETTI!

1128
00:49:32,704 --> 00:49:33,602
MY BAD.

1129
00:49:33,604 --> 00:49:34,670
>> THAT WAS SO LOUD.

1130
00:49:34,672 --> 00:49:35,905
>> WELL, YEAH.

1131
00:49:35,907 --> 00:49:38,641
PEOPLE NEED TO WAKE UP!

1132
00:49:38,643 --> 00:49:41,911
WE ARE MAKING TRANS KIDS GROW UP

1133
00:49:41,913 --> 00:49:42,778
TOO FAST.

1134
00:49:42,780 --> 00:49:44,580
WE SHOULD BE KEEPING THEM SAFE,

1135
00:49:44,582 --> 00:49:46,515
AND WE NEED TO LIFT THEM UP.

1136
00:49:46,517 --> 00:49:47,149
NOT ME, THEM.

1137
00:49:47,151 --> 00:49:49,752
I MEAN THE KIDS!

1138
00:49:49,754 --> 00:49:52,021
THEY GOT MY PRONOUNS RIGHT,

1139
00:49:52,023 --> 00:49:57,526
LET'S GO!

1140
00:49:57,528 --> 00:49:58,360
WAIT A MINUTE.

1141
00:49:58,362 --> 00:49:59,028
BEFORE I GO.

1142
00:49:59,030 --> 00:50:00,396
I WANT TO TALK TO YOU.

1143
00:50:00,398 --> 00:50:02,598
WHAT'S HAPPENING, KIDS, IS

1144
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:02,965
WRONG.

1145
00:50:02,967 --> 00:50:05,367
AND YOU DON'T NEED TO BE SCARED.

1146
00:50:05,369 --> 00:50:07,970
OUR JOB IS TO PROTECT YOU, AND

1147
00:50:07,972 --> 00:50:11,273
YOUR JOB IS TO FOCUS ON BEING A

1148
00:50:11,275 --> 00:50:11,540
KID.

1149
00:50:11,542 --> 00:50:13,809
IT'S KIND OF LIKE ME FLYING IN

1150
00:50:13,811 --> 00:50:14,910
THE SNL SKY.

1151
00:50:14,912 --> 00:50:17,046
THERE'S A BUNCH OF DUDES ASKING

1152
00:50:17,048 --> 00:50:19,081
YOU ABOUT YOUR CROTCH AND

1153

CONTROLLING WHEN AND WHERE YOU

1154
00:50:21,586 --> 00:50:23,886
GET TO PEE.
