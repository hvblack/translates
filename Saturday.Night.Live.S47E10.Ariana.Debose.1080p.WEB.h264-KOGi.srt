1
00:00:01,648 --> 00:00:05,599
AND NOW A MESSAGE FROM
PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN.

2
00:00:06,655 --> 00:00:08,801
GOOD EVENING!

3
00:00:12,767 --> 00:00:14,647
GOOD EVENING

4
00:00:18,099 --> 00:00:21,940
HELLO, MY FELLOW AMERICANS

5
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:24,361
AS I KEEP SAYING EVERY CHANCE I GET,

6
00:00:24,361 --> 00:00:28,631
WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF A
COLD, DARK WINTER.

7
00:00:28,631 --> 00:00:33,602
THIS WINTER IS SO DARK
REPUBLICANS DON'T THINK YO
SHOULD VOTE.

8
00:00:33,997 --> 00:00:36,547
I KNOW THIS VIRUS HAS DISRUPTED OUR LIVES,

9
00:00:36,547 --> 00:00:40,914
IT'S CANCELED
HOLIDAYS, WEDDINGS, QUINCEANERAS,

10
00:00:40,914 --> 00:00:43,380
GENDER REVEAL PARTIES,

11
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:47,522
WILD FIRES THAT STARTED
AS GENDER REVEAL PARTIES

12
00:00:47,522 --> 00:00:51,464
WHATEVER THE HELL IS HAPPENING
WITH NOVAK DJOKOVIC.

13
00:00:51,464 --> 00:00:56,340
I KNOW YOU'RE TIRED OF GETTING
EMAILS FROM YOUR KIDS' SCHOOL AT NIGHT SAYING

14
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:59,723
"OKAY, COME IN
TOMORROW
WE'RE FEELING LUCKY.

15
00:00:59,723 --> 00:01:04,950
I KNOW EVERY TIME A STRANGER
BREATHES ON YOU, YOU THINK,
THAT'S IT.
I'M DEAD

16
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:08,840
AMERICA, I'M HERE TO TELL YOU
THERE IS ONE SIMPLE THING

17
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:11,664
YOU
CAN DO TO MAKE THIS WHOLE VIRUS
GO AWAY.

18
00:01:11,664 --> 00:01:15,305
STOP SEEING "SPIDER-MAN.

19
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,971
JUST STOP SEEING "SPIDER-MAN."

20
00:01:20,971 --> 00:01:22,748
THINK ABOUT IT.

21
00:01:22,748 --> 00:01:27,368
WHEN DID "SPIDER-MAN" COME OUT
DECEMBER 17th.

22
00:01:27,702 --> 00:01:32,772
WHEN DID EVERY SINGLE PERSON GET
OMICRON?
THE WEEK AFTER DECEMBER 17th

23
00:01:32,772 --> 00:01:35,046
STOP SEEING "SPIDER-MAN.

24
00:01:35,046 --> 00:01:38,935
THAT'S REALLY ALL I HAVE TO SAY.
I YIELD THE REMAINDER OF MY TIME
FOR QUESTIONS.

25
00:01:38,935 --> 00:01:39,954
YES?

26
00:01:39,954 --> 00:01:45,024
I'M SORRY, DID YOU REALLY
JUST BLAME SPREAD THE ENTIRE
SPREAD OF OMICRON ON PEOPLE
SEEING "SPIDER-MAN?"

27
00:01:45,024 --> 00:01:47,803
I DID, YES.
NEXT QUESTION?

28
00:01:47,803 --> 00:01:51,896
DO YOU THINK ALL OF COVID
WILL END
IF PEOPLE STOP GOING TO THE
MOVIES

29
00:01:51,896 --> 00:01:54,786
I DIDN'T SAY DON'T GO TO THE
MOVIES

30
00:01:54,786 --> 00:01:57,482
I SAID STOP SEEING "SPIDER-MAN."

31
00:01:57,482 --> 00:01:59,355
SEE ANYTHING ELSE.

32
00:01:59,355 --> 00:02:02,081
I SAW THE FIRST HALF HOUR OF
"HOUSE OF GUCCI.

33
00:02:02,081 --> 00:02:05,289
THAT'S MORE THAN ENOUGH MOVIE
FOR ANYONE

34
00:02:05,289 --> 00:02:08,680
IS THIS THEORY BASED ON ANY
KIND OF DATA

35
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:13,318
YES
EVERYONE IN AMERICA HAS SEEN
SPIDER-MAN,"" LIKE, EIGHT TIMES."

36
00:02:13,318 --> 00:02:16,667
EVERYONE IN AMERICA ALSO HAS
COVID.

37
00:02:16,667 --> 00:02:18,621
STOP SEEING "SPIDER-MAN.

38
00:02:18,621 --> 00:02:20,703
HAVE YOU SEEN "SPIDER-MAN?"

39
00:02:20,703 --> 00:02:22,907
I COULDN'T GET TICKETS,

40
00:02:22,907 --> 00:02:25,318
AND I'M ON THE STUBS' A-LIST

41
00:02:25,318 --> 00:02:29,622
JILL AND I TRIED TO GO LAST
NIGHT AND THEY ONLY HAD ONE SEAT
LEFT IN THE FRONT ROW.

42
00:02:29,622 --> 00:02:31,388
WHAT WAS I SUPPOSED TO DO?

43
00:02:31,388 --> 00:02:34,546
MAKE JOE GO SEE "ENCANTO" ALONE

44
00:02:34,546 --> 00:02:38,515
WHILE I SIT TWO INCHES FROM THE
SCREEN LIKE THIS

45
00:02:40,428 --> 00:02:42,448
STOP SEEING "SPIDER-MAN.

46
00:02:42,448 --> 00:02:46,752
BUT WHAT ABOUT EXPERTS WHO
SAY THAT THE REAL PROBLEM IS A
LACK OF TESTING?

47
00:02:46,752 --> 00:02:48,793
OH, THEY TESTED "SPIDER-MAN."

48
00:02:48,793 --> 00:02:52,456
IT GOT 98% ON AU GRATIN
POTATOES

49
00:02:52,456 --> 00:02:55,416
HE MEANT TESTING FOR COVID.

50
00:02:55,416 --> 00:02:57,903
YOU WANT TO KNOW IF YOU HAVE
COVID?

51
00:02:57,903 --> 00:03:00,015
LOOK AT YOUR HAND.

52
00:03:00,015 --> 00:03:04,212
ARE YOU STILL HOLDING A TICKET
THAT SAY
YOU RECENTLY WENT TO SEE
"SPIDER-MAN?

53
00:03:04,914 --> 00:03:07,985
IF SO, THEN YOU HAVE COVID

54
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:12,320
ALL RIGHT
WELL, THEN, WHAT ABOUT THE OTHER
PROBLEMS
FACING AMERICA, LIKE INFLATION

55
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:14,358
SPIDER-MAN.

56
00:03:14,358 --> 00:03:17,894
OKAY.
THEN WHY CAN'T DEMOCRATS PASS
THE VOTING RIGHTS BILL

57
00:03:17,894 --> 00:03:20,476
DO YOU THINK PEOPLE CAN FOCUS
ON VOTING RIGHTS

58
00:03:20,476 --> 00:03:24,651
WHEN SPIDER-MAN
AUNT MAY IS A FREAKIN' SMOKE
SHOW

59
00:03:24,651 --> 00:03:28,882
MR. PRESIDENT, ISN'T THE REAL
REASON YOU CAN'T PASS THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT

60
00:03:28,882 --> 00:03:32,567
BECAUSE MEMBERS OF
YOUR OWN PARTY REFUSE TO GET RID
OF THE FILIBUSTER?

61
00:03:32,567 --> 00:03:36,021
IT'S TRUE
SPIDER-MAN HAS HIS VILLAINS.

62
00:03:36,021 --> 00:03:39,526
I HAVE JOE MANCHIN AND
KYRSTEN SINEMA

63
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,247
THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IS IF ONE OF
SPIDER-MAN'S VILLAINS SAW
KYRSTEN SINEMA, THEY'S BE LIKE,

64
00:03:45,247 --> 00:03:47,937
"HEY, HONEY, THAT OUTFIT IS A
LITTLE MUCH.

65
00:03:47,937 --> 00:03:52,246
WHAT ABOUT THE RUSSIAN TROOPS
THAT ARE NOW SURROUNDING THE UKRAINIAN BORDER

66
00:03:52,246 --> 00:03:55,145
PUSHING US TO
THE BRINK OF WORLD WAR III

67
00:03:55,145 --> 00:03:59,487
I MEAN, IF THAT DOESN'T SOUND
LIKE A JOB FOR SPIDER-MAN, I
DON'T KNOW WHAT DOES

68
00:03:59,487 --> 00:04:02,067
OKAY
I GOT TIME FOR ONE MORE
QUESTION

69
00:04:02,067 --> 00:04:04,578
YES, THE NERD.

70
00:04:06,087 --> 00:04:10,963
MR. PRESIDENT, IT SOUNDS LIKE
YOU WANT PEOPLE TO STOP SEEING
SPIDER-MAN."

71
00:04:10,963 --> 00:04:13,344
THAT'S THE GENERAL IDEA
YEAH

72
00:04:13,344 --> 00:04:16,177
DO YOU THINK THAT ELSEWHERE
IN THE MULTIVERSE,

73
00:04:16,177 --> 00:04:19,881
THERE'S A
VERSION OF YOU THAT WANTS PEOPLE
TO SEE "SPIDER-MAN?"

74
00:04:19,881 --> 00:04:22,804
FINALLY, A GOOD QUESTION!

75
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:25,458
I'VE ACTUALLY THOUGHT ABOUT THIS
A LOT.

76
00:04:25,458 --> 00:04:29,440
I'VE CONSULTED WITH DR. FAUCI
AND DR. STRANGE.

77
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:33,108
AS FAR AS I CAN TELL THERE ARE
AT LEAST THREE JOE BIDENS.

78
00:04:33,108 --> 00:04:35,529
ONE OF THEM IS ME.

79
00:04:35,529 --> 00:04:37,876
ONE OF THEM IS A JOE BIDEN THAT
LOST TO TRUMP.

80
00:04:37,876 --> 00:04:42,834
THAT BIDEN HOSTS A SHOW ON CNBC
CALLED "T-BIRDS, TACOS AND
TRAINS."

81
00:04:42,834 --> 00:04:47,590
AND THEN THERE'S A THIRD
JOE BIDEN THAT WAS THE GREATEST
PRESIDENT IN HISTORY

82
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:49,920
MY APPROVAL RATINGS ARE SKY
HIGH

83
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,927
I'M ACTUALLY SUPPORTED BY MY OWN PARTY,

84
00:04:52,927 --> 00:04:56,485
AND I UNDERSTAND THE SHOW
"EUPHORIA.

85
00:04:56,485 --> 00:05:01,217
I'M SORRY
YOU'RE NOW SAYING THAT WE'RE NOW
LIVING IN A SPIDER-MAN STYLE
MULTIVERSE

86
00:05:01,217 --> 00:05:06,186
DOESN'T THAT MAKE MORE SENSE
THAT WHATEVER THE HELL OUR
CURRENT WORLD IS

87
00:05:06,186 --> 00:05:08,106
I MEAN SERIOUSLY

88
00:05:08,106 --> 00:05:11,491
SERIOUSLY.
COME ON!

89
00:05:11,491 --> 00:05:15,204
SERIOUSLY, DON'T YOU WAKE UP
EVERY MORNING, LOOK AT THE NEWS

90
00:05:15,204 --> 00:05:18,023
AND THINK THIS CAN'T BE RIGHT.
THIS IS ALL CRAZY.

91
00:05:18,023 --> 00:05:21,915
PEOPLE GOT VACCINATED AND THE
PANDEMIC GOT WORSE

92
00:05:21,915 --> 00:05:26,268
YOU HAVE TO WEAR A MASK AT A
RESTAURANT FOR THE TEN FEET UNTIL YOU SIT DOWN,

93
00:05:26,268 --> 00:05:29,074
THEN YOU
TAKE IT OFF FOR THE WHOLE MEAL

94
00:05:29,074 --> 00:05:32,837
UNLESS YOU GO TO THE BATHROOM
AND THEN YOU GOTTA PUT IT BACK
ON

95
00:05:32,837 --> 00:05:37,421
IS THE COVID IN THE BATHROOM
HOW DOES ANY OF IT MAKE SENSE?

96
00:05:37,421 --> 00:05:39,869
MR. PRESIDENT, ARE YOU OKAY

97
00:05:39,869 --> 00:05:42,617
FOR THE FIRST TIME, HELL YES!

98
00:05:42,617 --> 00:05:45,673
IT'S LIKE THE WEBS HAVE FALLEN
FROM MY EYES

99
00:05:45,673 --> 00:05:48,437
I CAN FINALLY SEE.

100
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:58,839
WHEN YOUR TIME HAS COME, YOU
ARE READY.

101
00:05:59,212 --> 00:06:02,611
OKAY.
WHO THE HELL IS THAT

102
00:06:02,611 --> 00:06:05,619
I AM JOE BIDEN FROM THE REAL
UNIVERSE

103
00:06:05,619 --> 00:06:08,444
THE TIME LINE YOU ARE ALL LIVING
IN IS ABOUT TO COLLAPSE.

104
00:06:08,444 --> 00:06:11,847
YOU SEE, IT WAS CREATED AS A
JOKE STARTIN IN 2016

105
00:06:11,847 --> 00:06:14,651
WHEN THE CHICAGO CUBS
WON THE WORLD SERIES,

106
00:06:14,651 --> 00:06:18,678
AND NOW IT
SPIRALLED OUT OF CONTROL AND
COULD EXPLODE AT ANY MINUTE.

107
00:06:18,678 --> 00:06:21,206
AM I THE PRESIDENT IN THIS
REAL WORLD

108
00:06:21,206 --> 00:06:24,613
OF COURSE, NOT.
DO YOU THINK YOU WOULD LOSE FOUR TIMES

109
00:06:24,613 --> 00:06:27,436
AND THEN FINALLY WIN WHEN
YOU WERE 78?

110
00:06:27,741 --> 00:06:31,278
WHAT ABOUT THE REST OF US
ARE WE OKAY?

111
00:06:31,278 --> 00:06:33,903
EVERYONE ON EARTH IS BETTER
OFF IN THE REAL WORLD

112
00:06:33,903 --> 00:06:36,458
EXCEPT ONE
MAN NAMED PETE DAVIDSON.

113
00:06:36,458 --> 00:06:39,833
HIS WORLD IS MAYBE MORE FUN FOR HIM,

114
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:42,386
NOW HURRY BEFORE THE PORTAL
CLOSES

115
00:06:42,386 --> 00:06:44,470
I'LL COME BACK FOR YOU ALL.
I PROMISE.

116
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:46,758
RIGHT AFTER I PASS THE BUILD
BACK BETTER BILL

117
00:06:46,758 --> 00:06:49,781
DUDE, EVEN IN THE REAL
UNIVERSE
THAT'S NOT PASSING

118
00:06:49,781 --> 00:06:53,799
LIVE FROM NEW YORK, IT'S
SATURDAY NIGHT

119
00:09:04,211 --> 00:09:09,280
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN -
ARIANA DeBOSE.

120
00:09:32,297 --> 00:09:36,704
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.

121
00:09:36,704 --> 00:09:39,435
I AM SO HONORED TO BE HERE
TONIGHT.

122
00:09:39,435 --> 00:09:44,038
WOW!
2022 HAS ALREADY BEEN AN
EXCITING YEAR.

123
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,276
I AM HOSTING SNL,

124
00:09:48,276 --> 00:09:52,825
"" AND I WON A" GOLDEN GLOBE FOR MY ROLE AS
ANITA IN "WEST SIDE STORY.

125
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:58,927
SO NOW -- NOW NOT MANY PEOPLE
KNOW THIS,

126
00:09:58,927 --> 00:10:03,036
BUT "WEST SIDE STORY" IS
ACTUALLY BASED ON ANOTHER
CLASSIC TALE OF STAR-CROSSED LOVERS,

127
00:10:03,036 --> 00:10:05,454
"90 DAY FIANCE."

128
00:10:06,363 --> 00:10:11,655
BUT IT IS GREAT TO BE HERE
REPRESENTING NOT ONLY THE LATINO COMMUNITY AS AN AFRO-LATINA,

129
00:10:11,655 --> 00:10:13,411
BUT

130
00:10:13,905 --> 00:10:17,294
ALSO THE BROADWAY COMMUNITY.

131
00:10:17,448 --> 00:10:25,167
OBVIOUSLY -- OBVIOUSLY, BROADWAY
HAS BEEN
THROUGH A TOUGH COUPLE OF YEARS,

132
00:10:25,168 --> 00:10:26,315
LAST PASS

133
00:10:26,315 --> 00:10:29,570
BUT WE ARE A COMMUNITY THAT PERSEVERES,

134
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:31,357
AND I BELIEVE
BROADWAY CHANGES LIVES

135
00:10:31,357 --> 00:10:33,013
I MEAN, HEY, IT CHANGED MINE

136
00:10:33,013 --> 00:10:37,223
AND BROADWAY HAS THIS MAGICAL
ABILITY TO BRING PEOPLE
TOGETHER

137
00:10:37,223 --> 00:10:40,683
AND I THINK WE CAN ALL USE A
LITTLE BROADWAY RIGHT NOW.

138
00:10:40,683 --> 00:10:45,242
MAYBE -- MAYBE --

139
00:10:45,242 --> 00:10:48,804
MAYBE A LITTLE SOMETHING FROM
WEST SIDE STORY.
HUH?

140
00:10:53,106 --> 00:10:57,685
DID YOU SAY SING SONGS FROM
WEST SIDE STORY WITH
KATE McKINNON?

141
00:10:57,776 --> 00:10:59,937
NO, BUT HI, KATE.
HI.

142
00:10:59,937 --> 00:11:03,616
I'M SORRY.
IT'S MY FAVORITE SHOW.
I'VE
LOVED IT SINCE HIGH SCHOOL AND
BEFORE

143
00:11:03,616 --> 00:11:06,574
- DID YOU LIKE IT?
- I DIDN'T SEE IT

144
00:11:06,574 --> 00:11:10,892
I DON'T LEAVE THE HOUSE BECAUSE
OF COVID, AND ALSO I DON'T LEAVE
THE HOUSE.

145
00:11:10,892 --> 00:11:16,002
WELL, IN THAT CASE, WHY DON'T
WE BRING OUT SOME STOOLS AND WE
CAN SING TOGETHER.

146
00:11:18,858 --> 00:11:22,485
I DON'T THINK I EVEN REMEMBER
THE SONG

147
00:11:22,485 --> 00:11:24,883
TONIGHT IN A FLAT, PLEASE.

148
00:11:27,624 --> 00:11:31,659
* TONIGHT, TONIGH

00:11:31,659 --> 00:11:35,122

00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:41,766
ARIANA DeBOSE

THERE'S ONLY YOU TONIGHT *

154
00:11:48,529 --> 00:11:56,406
* WHAT YOU ARE, WHAT YOU DO

155
00:11:56,965 --> 00:12:00,012
- THAT WAS PRETTY GOOD, KATE.

158
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:09,268

159
00:12:09,268 --> 00:12:15,686

I MEAN, I MEAN, JUST SINGING IT
MAKES ME FEEL PRETTY

169
00:12:39,928 --> 00:12:41,724
WHICH IS CRAZY BECAUSE JUST LIKE AN HOUR AGO,

170
00:12:41,724 --> 00:12:45,068
WE WERE BOTH
IN OUR
SWEATPANTS SPOONING OUR
13-YEAR-OLD CATS

171
00:12:45,068 --> 00:12:49,682
I WASN'T DOING THAT
ME NEITHER.

172
00:12:50,374 --> 00:12:54,036
- MAMBO
- MAMBO, GO *

173
00:13:00,314 --> 00:13:02,507
YOUR TURN, KATE

174
00:13:02,922 --> 00:13:05,775
NO, THEY KNOW I DANCE

175
00:13:09,361 --> 00:13:13,032

176
00:13:13,101 --> 00:13:16,460
WHO KNOWS *

177
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:19,211
* THERE'S SOMETHING
DUE ANY DAY *

178
00:13:19,211 --> 00:13:20,977
* I WILL KNOW RIGHT AWAY

179
00:13:20,977 --> 00:13:25,026
SOON AS IT SHOWS *

180
00:13:25,026 --> 00:13:26,907
* IT MAY COME CANNONBALLING
DOWN THROUGH THE SKY *

181
00:13:26,907 --> 00:13:30,769
* GLEAM IN ITS EY
BRIGHT AS A ROSE *

182
00:13:30,769 --> 00:13:35,324
* I LIKE TO BE IN AMERICA
OKAY BY ME IN AMERICA *

183
00:13:35,379 --> 00:13:41,334
* EVERYTHING FREE IN AMERICA
FOR A SMALL FEE IN AMERICA *

184
00:13:41,335 --> 00:13:42,308
FINAL

185
00:13:42,308 --> 00:13:45,053
* TODAY

186
00:13:45,053 --> 00:13:48,039
THE MINUTES SEEM LIKE HOURS *

187
00:13:48,039 --> 00:13:51,601

188
00:13:51,601 --> 00:13:56,599
AND STILL THE SKY IS LIGHT *

189
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:00,900
* OH MOON, GROW BRIGHT

190
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:04,154
AND MAKE THIS ENDLESS DAY *

191
00:14:04,154 --> 00:14:08,186

TONIGHT *

193
00:14:18,749 --> 00:14:22,884
WE HAVE A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU

BLEACHERS ARE HERE

194
00:14:22,884 --> 00:14:24,563
SO STICK AROUND, WE'LL BE RIGHT

195
00:14:24,563 --> 00:14:28,173
HAPPY SATURDAY, NANA

00:14:37,548 --> 00:14:45,985
WELCOME BACK TO NBA ON TNT

197
00:14:36,843 --> 00:14:45,985
HALFTIME

198
00:14:36,843 --> 00:14:45,985
NETS AND KINGS ERNIE JOHNSON,

199
00:14:45,985 --> 00:14:48,154
JOINED BY MY PALS,

200
00:14:45,985 --> 00:14:48,154
CHARLES BARKLEY AND KENNY SMITH.

201
00:14:45,985 --> 00:14:48,154
SHAQ IS UNFORTUNATELY OUT SICK

202
00:14:48,154 --> 00:14:55,628
YEAH, HE SAYS HE'S GOT

203
00:14:48,154 --> 00:14:55,628
SOMETHING CALLED SHAQ FLU, BUT

204
00:14:48,154 --> 00:14:55,628
LET'S CALL IT WHAT IT IS

205
00:14:55,628 --> 00:14:57,097
THAT MAN GOT COVID

206
00:14:55,628 --> 00:14:57,097
HEY, HEY, HEY, YOU DON'T KNOW

207
00:14:55,628 --> 00:14:57,097
THAT CHARLES

208
00:14:57,097 --> 00:15:07,140
FILLING IN FOR SHAQ IS ANOTHER

209
00:14:57,097 --> 00:15:07,140
BIG MAN, YAO MING.

210
00:14:57,097 --> 00:15:07,140
YES

211
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:15,048
YAO IS HERE.

212
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:15,048
HELLO.

213
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:15,048
YAO, YOU ARE ENORMOUS, MAN.

214
00:15:15,048 --> 00:15:17,584
YOU KNOW, BEFORE THE SHOW, I

215
00:15:15,048 --> 00:15:17,584
WATCHED THIS MAN EAT AN ENTIRE

216
00:15:15,048 --> 00:15:17,584
PUMPKIN.

217
00:15:17,584 --> 00:15:22,789
STEM AND ALL

218
00:15:17,584 --> 00:15:22,789
YEAH.

219
00:15:17,584 --> 00:15:22,789
JUST A SNACK FOR Y'ALL

220
00:15:22,789 --> 00:15:27,494
WELL, SPEAKING OF COVID,

221
00:15:22,789 --> 00:15:27,494
BEFORE THE GAME, THE KINGS

222
00:15:22,789 --> 00:15:27,494
ENTIRE TEAM TESTED POSITIVE

223
00:15:27,494 --> 00:15:32,699
ALONG WITH MOST OF THEIR

224
00:15:27,494 --> 00:15:32,699
COACHING STAFF AND TRAINERS AND

225
00:15:27,494 --> 00:15:32,699
THEY WERE FORCED TO FIND

226
00:15:32,699 --> 00:15:43,977
REPLACEMENTS VERY QUICK, BUT

227
00:15:32,699 --> 00:15:43,977
THEY DID AND AT THE HALF, IT'S

228
00:15:32,699 --> 00:15:43,977
NETS LEAD THE KINGS 268-1.

229
00:15:43,977 --> 00:15:47,847
CHARLES WHY CAN'T SACRAMENTO

230
00:15:43,977 --> 00:15:47,847
GET ANYTHING GOING TONIGHT

231
00:15:43,977 --> 00:15:47,847
WELL, IN MY OPINION, THE

232
00:15:47,847 --> 00:15:52,652
BIGGEST THING TO ME IS THAT THE

233
00:15:47,847 --> 00:15:52,652
KINGS DON'T HAVE ANY NBA PLAYERS

234
00:15:47,847 --> 00:15:52,652
ON THEIR TEAM WHEREAS THE NETS

235
00:15:52,652 --> 00:15:57,757
DO

236
00:15:52,652 --> 00:15:57,757
YEAH, I WROTE DOWN THE SAME

237
00:15:52,652 --> 00:15:57,757
THING.

238
00:15:57,757 --> 00:16:03,663
YOU CAN SEE HOW THE KINGS

239
00:15:57,757 --> 00:16:03,663
LACK OF NBA PLAYERS IS

240
00:15:57,757 --> 00:16:03,663
REFLECTED IN THE SCORE

241
00:16:03,663 --> 00:16:09,736
YEAH, THE KINGS PLAYERS

242
00:16:03,663 --> 00:16:09,736
TONIGHT ARE ALL FANS OR ARENA

243
00:16:03,663 --> 00:16:09,736
SUPPORT STAFF.

244
00:16:09,736 --> 00:16:18,144
ANY THOUGHTS

245
00:16:09,736 --> 00:16:18,144
ANY THOUGHTS, YAO?

246
00:16:09,736 --> 00:16:18,144
THEY'RE TINY PEOPLE

247
00:16:18,144 --> 00:16:21,781
TOO SMALL.

248
00:16:18,144 --> 00:16:21,781
WELL SAID, YAO.

249
00:16:18,144 --> 00:16:21,781
LET'S LOOK AT A MATCH UP HERE.

250
00:16:21,781 --> 00:16:28,388

DOUG MCCORMICK FOR THE KINGS

254
00:16:28,388 --> 00:16:33,259
LOOK AT THE NUMBERS, OKAY

255
00:16:28,388 --> 00:16:33,259
McCORMACK IS JUST GETTING

256
00:16:33,259 --> 00:16:37,530
OUTPLAYED OUT THERE AND THE TWO

257
00:16:33,259 --> 00:16:37,530
ASTHMA ATTACKS DIDN'T HELP

258
00:16:33,259 --> 00:16:37,530
THAT'S BEEN THE CASE FOR MANY

259
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:41,067
KINGS PLAYERS TONIGHT.

260
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:41,067

TONIGHT?

266
00:16:45,872 --> 00:16:50,543
LEFT SIDE

267
00:16:45,872 --> 00:16:50,543
NOT THE BEST FIRST HALF FOR

268
00:16:50,543 --> 00:16:54,080
THE KINGS.

269
00:16:50,543 --> 00:16:54,080
WHAT WAS IT LIKE OUT ON THE

270
00:16:50,543 --> 00:16:54,080

00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:58,952
YEAH.

272
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:58,952
I'M SORRY.

273
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:58,952
I'M KIND OF WINDED

274
00:16:58,952 --> 00:17:01,488
WAS WORKING HARD OUT THERE

275
00:16:58,952 --> 00:17:01,488
YOU'RE TALL.

276
00:16:58,952 --> 00:17:01,488
HOW TALL ARE YOU

277
00:17:01,488 --> 00:17:11,731
5'7."

278
00:17:01,488 --> 00:17:11,731
AWESOME, YEAH

279
00:17:01,488 --> 00:17:11,731
YEAH, LOOK, WE CAME TO PLAY

281
00:17:11,731 --> 00:17:15,035
I WAS CONFIDENT GOIN

282
00:17:11,731 --> 00:17:15,035
IN BECAUSE I PLAYED PICKUP AT MY

283
00:17:15,035 --> 00:17:22,042
GYM WITH OTHER WHITE GUYS MY

284
00:17:15,035 --> 00:17:22,042
SIZE, BUT BEING OUT THERE

285
00:17:15,035 --> 00:17:22,042
AGAINST THE NETS

286
00:17:22,042 --> 00:17:25,245
I REALIZED THAT BASKETBALL IS AN

287
00:17:22,042 --> 00:17:25,245
IMPOSSIBLE SPORT PLAYED BY

288
00:17:22,042 --> 00:17:25,245
GIANTS AND GODS.

289
00:17:25,245 --> 00:17:27,347
WELL, GOOD LUCK IN THE SECOND

290
00:17:25,245 --> 00:17:27,347
HALF

00:17:25,245 --> 00:17:27,347

I'M SCARED SO I'M GOING HOME

294
00:17:27,347 --> 00:17:32,552
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

295
00:17:32,552 --> 00:17:36,322
WELL, NOT EVERY KINGS PLAYER

296
00:17:32,552 --> 00:17:36,322
HAS BEEN SHUT OUT.

297
00:17:32,552 --> 00:17:36,322
ALICIA MILLER MANAGED TO PUT ONE

298
00:17:36,322 --> 00:17:42,429

299
00:17:36,322 --> 00:17:42,429
SHE JOINS US NOW

300
00:17:36,322 --> 00:17:42,429

00:17:46,099 --> 00:17:52,639
ISN'T THAT WILD?

305
00:17:46,099 --> 00:17:52,639
THIS IS LIKE THE CRAZIEST GIRLS'

306
00:17:46,099 --> 00:17:52,639

00:17:57,510 --> 00:18:00,847
YOU WERE ALSO CALLED FOR

312
00:17:57,510 --> 00:18:00,847
TRAVELING 39 TIMES

313
00:18:00,847 --> 00:18:07,320
I KNOW.

314
00:18:00,847 --> 00:18:07,320
I KEEP FORGETTING TO BOUNCE THE

315
00:18:00,847 --> 00:18:07,320
BALL.

316
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:15,028
YEAH.

317
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:15,028
BUT THEN YOU GOT EJECTED FOR

318
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:15,028
TAKING A SELFIE WITH BLAKE

319
00:18:15,028 --> 00:18:20,266
GRIFFIN DURING THE GAME.

320
00:18:15,028 --> 00:18:20,266
I HAD TO.

321
00:18:15,028 --> 00:18:20,266
I DIDN'T KNOW IF I WAS GOING TO

322
00:18:20,266 --> 00:18:32,679
SEE HIM AGAIN.

323
00:18:20,266 --> 00:18:32,679
YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE TO SHOOT YOUR

324
00:18:20,266 --> 00:18:32,679
SHOT

325
00:18:32,679 --> 00:18:45,225

326
00:18:32,679 --> 00:18:45,225
BUT GO SACS!

327

KEVIN DURANT WITH 178

AND MOST PLAYERS CRYING ON THE

329
00:18:45,225 --> 00:18:50,830
COURT AT ONCE.

330
00:18:45,225 --> 00:18:50,830
SIX KINGS PLAYERS WERE CRYING AT

331
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:55,135
THE SAME TIME.

332
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:55,135
I'M SORRY, Y'ALL.

333
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:55,135
I JUST GOT A GLIMPSE OF YAO'S

334
00:18:55,135 --> 00:18:58,304
HANDS.

335
00:18:55,135 --> 00:18:58,304
IT IS HUGE, MAN.

336
00:18:55,135 --> 00:18:58,304

338
00:18:58,304 --> 00:19:07,313
LOOK AT THIS

339
00:18:58,304 --> 00:19:07,313
THE MAN HAS LIKE THE IRON GIANT.

340
00:19:07,313 --> 00:19:11,351
NO, NO, NOT MY FACE, MAN.

341
00:19:07,313 --> 00:19:11,351
NOT MY FACE.

342
00:19:07,313 --> 00:19:11,351
GET OUT OF HERE.

343
00:19:11,351 --> 00:19:13,019
THAT'S CUTE

344
00:19:11,351 --> 00:19:13,019
WELL, LET'S GO RIGHT TO THE

345
00:19:11,351 --> 00:19:13,019
SOURCE OF THE KINGS' ISSUES

347
00:19:13,019 --> 00:19:16,589
TEMPORARY COACH PATRICK BEAMUS

00:19:13,019 --> 00:19:16,589
JOINS US LIVE.

349
00:19:16,589 --> 00:19:20,727
NOW YOU COACHED AT LITTLE

350
00:19:16,589 --> 00:19:20,727
DUNKER'S DAY CAMP, HUH

351
00:19:16,589 --> 00:19:20,727
THAT'S CORRECT.

352
00:19:20,727 --> 00:19:27,300
I COACHED MY SON'S TEAM.

353
00:19:20,727 --> 00:19:27,300
HE -- HE WAS ACTUALLY DRAFTED,

354
00:19:20,727 --> 00:19:27,300
TOO.

355
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:35,475
HE'S BEEN GUARDING KYRIE IRVING.

356
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:35,475
OH, YEAH.

357
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:35,475
I THINK WE'VE GOT A PICTURE OF

358
00:19:35,475 --> 00:19:41,181
THAT

359
00:19:35,475 --> 00:19:41,181
YEAH, YEAH.

360
00:19:35,475 --> 00:19:41,181
HE ACTUALLY GOT KIND OF HURT

361
00:19:41,181 --> 00:19:46,653
THERE.

362
00:19:41,181 --> 00:19:46,653
I HOPE WE BOTH GET COVID SO WE

363
00:19:41,181 --> 00:19:46,653
CAN LEAVE.

364
00:19:46,653 --> 00:19:57,230
THAT SOUNDS ABOUT RIGHT

365
00:19:46,653 --> 00:19:57,230
COACH?

366
00:19:57,230 --> 00:19:58,832
KENNY, HOW CAN SACK TOWN PULL

367
00:19:57,230 --> 00:19:58,832
OFF A WIN TONIGHT.

368
00:19:57,230 --> 00:19:58,832
I SAY IF THE KINGS PLAYER HAS

369
00:19:58,832 --> 00:20:00,600
SOME SORT OF SPACE JAM LIKE MY

370
00:19:58,832 --> 00:20:00,600
MAGICAL SHOE SITUATION, THEY

371
00:19:58,832 --> 00:20:00,600
MIGHT BE ABLE TO ESTABLISH A

372
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,602
WIN.

373
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,602
CHARLES?

374
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,602
MY PREDICTION IS I'M OUT

375
00:20:02,602 --> 00:20:07,640
100 GRAND.

376
00:20:02,602 --> 00:20:07,640
BECAUSE I BET ON THESE CLOWNS TO

377
00:20:02,602 --> 00:20:07,640
WIN.

378
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09,376
WHY DO I DO THIS TO MYSELF

379
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09,376
I DON'T KNOW

380
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09,376
ALL RIGHT.

381
00:20:09,376 --> 00:20:11,478
WELL, WE'VE GOT TO TAKE A BREAK.

382
00:20:09,376 --> 00:20:11,478
YAO, YOU WANT TO THROW US TO

383
00:20:09,376 --> 00:20:11,478
COMMERCIAL, BUD?

384
00:20:11,478 --> 00:20:20,920

00:21:33,910 --> 00:21:37,009
WITH
ABSOLUTELY NONE OF THE FUN OR
CHARM.

409
00:21:37,009 --> 00:21:38,733
FLOWERS, MY PET

410
00:21:38,733 --> 00:21:42,144
PLEASE, IT AIN'T LIKE THAT
BETWEEN US
I'M NOT YOUR PET

411
00:21:42,144 --> 00:21:42,978

FATHER'S GONE, MOTHER'S A DRUNK.

417
00:21:54,454 --> 00:21:57,558
WHEN YOU GONNA STOP WORKING
ON THIS STUPID ROBOT

418
00:21:57,558 --> 00:22:00,843
AND MAKE SOME
MONEY FOR THIS FAMILY?
WHAT FAMILY

419
00:22:00,910 --> 00:22:03,127
I RAISED A DAMN NERD.

420
00:22:03,127 --> 00:22:07,008
A YOUNG GENIUS ALONE IN THE
WORLD.

421
00:22:08,917 --> 00:22:10,233
YOU DON'T LOVE HER.

422
00:22:10,233 --> 00:22:13,388
NO, BUT I LOVE HOW SHE MAKE
IT CLAP.

423
00:22:13,727 --> 00:22:16,023
OH, MY NOSE

00:22:16,023 --> 00:22:18,457
DID I DO THAT?

425
00:22:18,457 --> 00:22:20,898
DID I DO THAT?

426
00:22:20,898 --> 00:22:23,152
WHAT IF I SHOT YOU IN THE FACE

427
00:22:23,152 --> 00:22:26,524
DID I DO THAT?

428
00:22:27,095 --> 00:22:28,798
DROP THE GUN, STEVE

429
00:22:28,798 --> 00:22:34,096
"ROLLING STONE" RAVES "FAMILY
MATTERS" IS THE NUMBER ONE WORST
CHOICE FOR A SITCOM TO MODERNIZE LIKE THIS,

430
00:22:34,096 --> 00:22:38,547
WHILE "ENTERTAINMENT
WEEKLY" ADDS THIS GIF OF

THE STEVE URKEL I KNOW IS WAY
TOO SMART FOR THAT NONSENSE.

433
00:22:44,644 --> 00:22:46,023
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE
OUT HERE

434
00:22:46,023 --> 00:22:49,136

BITCH

438
00:22:56,672 --> 00:22:58,782
IF YOU CONTINUE DOWN THIS PATH,

439
00:22:58,782 --> 00:23:02,708
YOU'RE GOING TO WIND UP
DEAD OR LOCKED UP BY YOUR 18th
BIRTHDAY

440
00:23:02,708 --> 00:23:06,190
AIN'T NOBODY GOING TO CARE.
I AIN'T GOT A FAMILY.

441
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:11,099
YOU'RE WRONG, STEVE

GOOD MORNING

00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:42,402
I'D LIKE TO WELCOME EVERYONE TO
CITY HALL.

582
00:27:42,512 --> 00:27:45,220
AS YOU KNOW, IT'S BEEN A TOUGH
FEW YEARS FOR NEW YORK,

583
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:47,622

 AND YOU ALL
FEEL THAT?

599
00:28:35,445 --> 00:28:38,045
NEW YORK IS BACK, BABY

600
00:28:38,045 --> 00:28:42,356
THIS CITY'S NEVER HAD A MAYOR
WITH SO MUCH SWAGGER BEFORE.

601
00:28:42,356 --> 00:28:43,902
I MEAN
YOU ALL SEE ME OUTSIDE

602
00:28:43,902 --> 00:28:48,135
THE PEA COATS, THE SCARF, THE
SHINE OR THE BALDY,

603
00:28:48,135 --> 00:28:50,487
 YOU CAN TELL
I HAVE SWAGGER

604
00:28:50,487 --> 00:28:51,766
IT KEEPS ME HEALTHY.

605
00:28:51,766 --> 00:28:57,277
SEE, THE CITY'S BEEN SUFFERING
FROM WHAT I CALL, A SWAGLESS"
EXISTENCE.

606
00:28:57,277 --> 00:28:59,897
YOU ONLY HAD NO SWAGGER.
THAT'S WHY YOU'RE GETTING SICK

607
00:28:59,897 --> 00:29:02,295
NO OFFENSE, LET'S JUST BE REAL

608
00:29:02,295 --> 00:29:05,968
I HAVEN'T BEEN SICK IN OVER 60
YEARS.

609
00:29:05,968 --> 00:29:08,262
I'M MUSCULAR, I'M VEGAN, 

610
00:29:08,262 --> 00:29:11,738
AND I GET THAT THING THING EVERY DAY
BEFORE BREAKFAST, ALL RIGHT?

611
00:29:11,738 --> 00:29:15,560
YOU CAN'T START THE DAY WITHOUT
FINISHING FIRST, YOU UNDERSTAND
ME

612
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:18,844
I'M JUST PLAYING, UNLESS YOU
LIKE THAT.

613
00:29:18,844 --> 00:29:22,175
OKAY
LET'S GET THESE QUESTIONS GOING
SO WE CAN FIX THIS CITY.

614
00:29:22,175 --> 00:29:24,316
BITCH UP FROM NEW YORK

OKAY

616
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:32,152
I TOLD YOU ALL THAT.

617
00:29:32,152 --> 00:29:36,324
I WAS A POLICE OFFICER FOR OVER
70 YEARS

618
00:29:36,324 --> 00:29:40,719
IF I GET STARTLED, I START
BEATING PEOPLE ASSES

619
00:29:40,719 --> 00:29:42,506
I DON'T WANT TO DO THAT.

620
00:29:42,506 --> 00:29:46,165
OKAY, EXCUSE ME
THIS MAN AIN'T BILL de BLASIO.

621
00:29:46,165 --> 00:29:50,476
AND HE WILL KICK YOUR ASS

622
00:29:51,370 --> 00:29:55,588
NOW, NOW, SHE'S JOKING, BUT
SHE'S FROM THE BRONX, SO IS SHE?

623
00:29:57,582 --> 00:29:59,380
OKAY.
QUESTIONS?

624
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:02,238
LET'S START WITH THE SQUIRREL UP
FRONT.
GO AHEAD, SQUIRREL

625
00:30:02,238 --> 00:30:05,731
ME?
OKAY

626
00:30:05,731 --> 00:30:10,197
UH, MR. MAYOR, YOU SAID YOU
INTEND TO KEEP SCHOOLS OPEN

627
00:30:10,197 --> 00:30:15,468
DESPITE SKYROCKETING COVID
NUMBERS AND OUTCRY FROM
TEACHERS

628
00:30:15,468 --> 00:30:17,319
DOES THAT STILL MAKE SENSE

629
00:30:17,319 --> 00:30:18,958
THANK YOU, NUT-NUT, 

630
00:30:18,958 --> 00:30:22,086
LITTLE SQUIRREL MAN
ASKED A REALLY GOOD QUESTION,

631
00:30:22,086 --> 00:30:26,402
YES.
KIDS NEED TO STAY IN SCHOOL,
LEARN ABOUT LIFE

632
00:30:26,402 --> 00:30:28,895
THERE ARE TOO MANY SWAGLESS

633
00:30:22,822 --> 00:30:28,895
PARENTS OUT THERE GIVING THEIR

634
00:30:22,822 --> 00:30:28,895
KIDS NO SWAGGER AT HOME AND AS A

635
00:30:28,895 --> 00:30:35,502
MAYOR THAT'S SO SAUCY, JUST

636
00:30:28,895 --> 00:30:35,502
DRIPPING IN SWAG, OH

637
00:30:28,895 --> 00:30:35,502
IT HURTS MY HEART.

638
00:30:35,502 --> 00:30:37,704
IT'S DANGEROUS FOR KIDS TO BE

639
00:30:35,502 --> 00:30:37,704
OUT THERE WITH NO SWAG

640
00:30:35,502 --> 00:30:37,704
LET ME TELL YOU A STORY ABOUT A

641
00:30:37,704 --> 00:30:42,275
BOY I WENT TO SCHOOL WITH,

642
00:30:37,704 --> 00:30:42,275
LITTLE TIMMY

643
00:30:37,704 --> 00:30:42,275
NOW, THE BOY HAD NO SWAG

644
00:30:42,275 --> 00:30:46,946
DUMBASS SHOES, DUMBASS SHIRT,

645
00:30:42,275 --> 00:30:46,946
DUMBASS PANTS.

646
00:30:42,275 --> 00:30:46,946
ONE DAY LITTLE TIMMY WALKED HIS

647
00:30:46,946 --> 00:30:54,888
DUSTY ASS UP TO THE FINEST GIRL

648
00:30:46,946 --> 00:30:54,888
IN SCHOOL, TIFFANY

649
00:30:46,946 --> 00:30:54,888
SHE WAS FINE, Y'ALL.

650
00:30:54,888 --> 00:31:00,193
LITTLE TIMMY LOOKED HER RIGHT IN

651
00:30:54,888 --> 00:31:00,193
HER EYE AND -- BOOM!

652
00:30:54,888 --> 00:31:00,193
DROPPED DEAD

653
00:31:00,193 --> 00:31:05,098
THE LACK OF SWAGGER STOPPED THE

654
00:31:00,193 --> 00:31:05,098
BOY'S HEART.

655
00:31:00,193 --> 00:31:05,098
IT WAS SO SAD.

656
00:31:05,098 --> 00:31:07,167
AND YOU KNOW WHAT SHAKESPEARE

657
00:31:05,098 --> 00:31:07,167
SAID, "IF DOTH LACKING THE

658
00:31:05,098 --> 00:31:07,167
SWAGGER, WOTH FOR ART THOU,

659
00:31:07,167 --> 00:31:13,807
HEART SHALL BEAT" OR SOMETHING

660
00:31:07,167 --> 00:31:13,807
LIKE THAT.

661
00:31:07,167 --> 00:31:13,807
BITCH, I'M FROM NEW YORK

662
00:31:13,807 --> 00:31:18,178
DOES THAT ANSWER YOUR QUESTION

663
00:31:13,807 --> 00:31:18,178
NOT REALLY, NO.

664
00:31:13,807 --> 00:31:18,178
GOOD.

665
00:31:18,178 --> 00:31:24,117
NEXT QUESTION.

666
00:31:18,178 --> 00:31:24,117
WAIT, MR. MAYOR

667
00:31:18,178 --> 00:31:24,117
NO, NO, NO, NO.

668
00:31:24,117 --> 00:31:26,920
BABY, EXCUSE ME.

669
00:31:24,117 --> 00:31:26,920
LET ME ASK YOU ONE MORE

670
00:31:24,117 --> 00:31:26,920
QUESTION

671
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:35,995
NO, NO, NO

672
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:35,995
THAT'S HOW Y'ALL SOUND

673
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:35,995
THIS AIN'T THE C TRAIN, OKAY

674
00:31:35,995 --> 00:31:37,530
WE DO HAVE STANDARDS

675
00:31:35,995 --> 00:31:37,530
WE DO

676
00:31:35,995 --> 00:31:37,530
GO DEEP

677
00:31:37,530 --> 00:31:39,632
ALL RIGHT

678
00:31:37,530 --> 00:31:39,632
MISS LADY, GO AHEAD.

679
00:31:37,530 --> 00:31:39,632
MR. MAYOR, LAST WEEK, YOU

680
00:31:39,632 --> 00:31:41,201
SAID "LOW SKILL WORKERS DON'T

681
00:31:39,632 --> 00:31:41,201
HAVE THE SKILLS TO SIT IN AN

682
00:31:39,632 --> 00:31:41,201
OFFICE."

683
00:31:41,201 --> 00:31:47,440
DO YOU REALLY BELIEVE THAT

684
00:31:41,201 --> 00:31:47,440
I'M GLAD YOU BROUGHT THAT

685
00:31:41,201 --> 00:31:47,440
BACK UP PRINCESS PEACH

686
00:31:47,440 --> 00:32:04,524
AND CONGRATULATIONS ON ESCAPING

687
00:31:47,440 --> 00:32:04,524
THAT CASTLE.

688
00:31:47,440 --> 00:32:04,524
LOOK, THAT QUOTE WAS TAKEN OUT

689
00:32:04,524 --> 00:32:05,725
OF CONTEXT

690
00:32:04,524 --> 00:32:05,725
LET ME CLARIFY

691
00:32:04,524 --> 00:32:05,725
BY UNSKILLED WORKERS, I MEANT

692
00:32:05,725 --> 00:32:09,896
FOLKS WITH TRASH JOBS -- I MEAN,

693
00:32:05,725 --> 00:32:09,896
TRASH LIVES.

694
00:32:05,725 --> 00:32:09,896
WAIT, NO

695
00:32:09,896 --> 00:32:14,567
WHAT I MEAN IS

696
00:32:09,896 --> 00:32:14,567
IF YOU WERE BETTER AT LIFE, YOU

697
00:32:09,896 --> 00:32:14,567
HAVE A DESK.

698
00:32:14,567 --> 00:32:16,136
NO

699
00:32:14,567 --> 00:32:16,136
WAIT

700
00:32:14,567 --> 00:32:16,136
I'M SORRY.

701
00:32:16,136 --> 00:32:18,805
YOU ALL MISHEARING ME AND YOU'RE

702
00:32:16,136 --> 00:32:18,805
MAKING ME MISQUOTE MYSELF.

703
00:32:16,136 --> 00:32:18,805
LISTEN -- I MEAN -- LOOK AT OUR

704
00:32:18,805 --> 00:32:20,807
SOCIETY, OKAY?

705
00:32:18,805 --> 00:32:20,807
THERE'S KINGS AND THERE'S QUEENS

706
00:32:18,805 --> 00:32:20,807
AND THEN EVERYONE ELSE BELOW

707
00:32:20,807 --> 00:32:27,080
THAT, THE DIRTY PEOPLE

708
00:32:20,807 --> 00:32:27,080
IS THAT BETTER FOR YOU

709
00:32:20,807 --> 00:32:27,080
I DON'T LIKE HOW YOU ALL MAKING

710
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:32,085
ME FEEL ABOUT THIS RIGHT NOW

711
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:32,085
I MEAN, I WAS A COP FOR 97

712
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:32,085
YEARS.

713
00:32:32,085 --> 00:32:45,098
DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME

714
00:32:32,085 --> 00:32:45,098
SHOW ME SOME RESPECT

715
00:32:32,085 --> 00:32:45,098
NEXT QUESTION, WEIRD EMINEM.

716
00:32:45,098 --> 00:32:47,100
I'M HERE.

717
00:32:45,098 --> 00:32:47,100
MR. MAYOR, WHAT QUALIFICATIONS

718
00:32:45,098 --> 00:32:47,100
DOES YOUR BROTHER HAVE TO BE THE

719
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:48,768
HEAD OF YOUR SECURITY DETAIL AND

720
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:48,768
ISN'T THAT NEPOTISM?

721
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:48,768
THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION,

722
00:32:48,768 --> 00:32:51,271
SLIM SHADY

723
00:32:48,768 --> 00:32:51,271
NOW YOU ALL KEEP ASKING ABOUT MY

724
00:32:48,768 --> 00:32:51,271
BROTHER LIKE YOU ALL CAN KICK

725
00:32:51,271 --> 00:32:59,179
HIS ASS OR SOMETHING

726
00:32:51,271 --> 00:32:59,179
LISTEN, I WAS A COP FOR OVER 222

727
00:32:51,271 --> 00:32:59,179
YEARS.

728
00:32:59,179 --> 00:33:07,087
I TRUST MY BROTHER

729
00:32:59,179 --> 00:33:07,087
WE GOT A LOT OF SECRETS

730
00:32:59,179 --> 00:33:07,087
TOGETHER, FAIR, TOO.

731
00:33:07,087 --> 00:33:11,291
LET'S NOT FORGET JFK APPOINTED

732
00:33:07,087 --> 00:33:11,291
HIS BROTHER.

733
00:33:07,087 --> 00:33:11,291
WHY?

734
00:33:11,291 --> 00:33:18,932
BECAUSE THE MAN HAS SWAGGER.

735
00:33:11,291 --> 00:33:18,932
I COULD BE YOUR JFK, NEW YORK.

736
00:33:11,291 --> 00:33:18,932
I'M OUT HERE LOOKING FOR MY

737
00:33:18,932 --> 00:33:25,739
MARILYN MONROE

738
00:33:18,932 --> 00:33:25,739
SHOUT OUT.

739
00:33:18,932 --> 00:33:25,739
BUT UNLIKE JFK, I'M NOT GOING

740
00:33:25,739 --> 00:33:29,909
GET POPPED IN THE HEAD

741
00:33:25,739 --> 00:33:29,909
I'M GOING TO RECEIVE SOME.

742
00:33:25,739 --> 00:33:29,909
UNDERSTAND THAT?

743
00:33:29,909 --> 00:33:31,678
HEY!

744
00:33:29,909 --> 00:33:31,678
OKAY, THAT'S MY STAFF WAVING AT

745
00:33:29,909 --> 00:33:31,678
ME SAYING I SHOULD NOT HAVE MADE

746
00:33:31,678 --> 00:33:35,181
THAT JOKE.

747
00:33:31,678 --> 00:33:35,181
AND THAT'S FAIR.

748
00:33:31,678 --> 00:33:35,181
I DO APOLOGIZE UNLESS YOU LIKE

749
00:33:35,181 --> 00:33:39,853
THAT

750
00:33:35,181 --> 00:33:39,853
OKAY, HOW MUCH TIME I GOT?

751
00:33:35,181 --> 00:33:39,853
I GOT TO RUN, Y'ALL, BUT I'LL

752
00:33:39,853 --> 00:33:41,888
LEAVE YOU WITH THIS, NEW YORK.

753
00:33:39,853 --> 00:33:41,888
YOU ALL INCLUDE BLACK

754
00:33:39,853 --> 00:33:41,888
PAUL BUNYAN HANDS, OKAY?

755
00:33:41,888 --> 00:33:52,866
WE'RE GOING TO BEAT THIS VIRUS

756
00:33:41,888 --> 00:33:52,866
TOGETHER, I BELIEVE THAT

757
00:33:41,888 --> 00:33:52,866
PLUS, YOU KNOW WHAT RHYMES WITH

758
00:33:52,866 --> 00:33:55,835
COUGH?

759
00:33:52,866 --> 00:33:55,835
TOUGH.

760
00:33:52,866 --> 00:33:55,835
I MEAN, IT DOESN'T, BUT IT

761
00:33:55,835 --> 00:33:57,270
SHOULD

762
00:33:55,835 --> 00:33:57,270
AND I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, I THINK

763
00:33:55,835 --> 00:33:57,270
COVID KNOWS BETTER THAN TO RUN

764
00:33:57,270 --> 00:34:04,144
UP ON SOMEBODY LIKE ME

765
00:33:57,270 --> 00:34:04,144
PLEASE, COVID, I WOULD LOVE

766
00:33:57,270 --> 00:34:04,144
THAT

767
00:34:04,144 --> 00:34:06,780
COVID-19 IS WELCOME IN THIS

768
00:34:04,144 --> 00:34:06,780
NEW -- COVID IS WELCOME IN

769

00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:13,219
THAT, YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING

771
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:13,219
OKAY.

772
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:13,219
MAYBE LET'S NOT WELCOM

773
00:34:13,219 --> 00:34:16,056

THANK YOU

875
00:39:07,875 --> 00:39:09,309
GOOD EVENING, EVERYONE

876
00:39:07,875 --> 00:39:09,309
WELCOME TO "WEEKEND UPDATE.

877
00:39:09,309 --> 00:39:17,551
I'M MICHAEL CHE.

878
00:39:09,309 --> 00:39:17,551
AND I'M COLIN JOST.

879
00:39:09,309 --> 00:39:17,551
WELL, JUST LIKE EVERYBODY

880
00:39:17,551 --> 00:39:22,222
ELSE, PRESIDENT BIDEN'S NEW

881
00:39:17,551 --> 00:39:22,222
YEAR'S RESOLUTION FELL APART IN

882
00:39:17,551 --> 00:39:22,222
THE THIRD WEEK OF JANUARY.

883
00:39:22,222 --> 00:39:29,329
THE SUPREME COURT STRUCK DOWN

884
00:39:22,222 --> 00:39:29,329
HIS VACCINE MANDATE, THE VOTING

885
00:39:22,222 --> 00:39:29,329
RIGHTS BILL GOT BLOCKED AN

886
00:39:29,329 --> 00:39:32,399
HIS APPROVAL RATING IS SO LOW

887
00:39:29,329 --> 00:39:32,399
HE'S GONE INTO POWER SAVE MODE

888
00:39:29,329 --> 00:39:32,399
BUT I WILL POINT OUT THERE WAS

889
00:39:32,399 --> 00:39:36,036
ANOTHER PRESIDENT WHO HAD A

890
00:39:32,399 --> 00:39:36,036
DISASTROUS START TO HIS FIRST

891
00:39:32,399 --> 00:39:36,036
TERM, YET HE BECAME AN

892
00:39:36,036 --> 00:39:40,674
INSPIRATION TO GENERATIONS OF

893
00:39:36,036 --> 00:39:40,674
REPUBLICANS TO THIS DAY.

894
00:39:36,036 --> 00:39:40,674
I'M TALKING, OF COURSE, ABOUT

895
00:39:40,674 --> 00:39:51,819
JEFFERSON DAVIS.

896
00:39:40,674 --> 00:39:51,819
PRESIDENT OF THE CONFEDERACY

897
00:39:40,674 --> 00:39:51,819
AND THERE ARE STILL STATUES OF

898
00:39:51,819 --> 00:40:01,495
HIM IN 10 DIFFERENT STATES,

899
00:39:51,819 --> 00:40:01,495
WHICH, COME TO THINK OF IT, IS

900
00:39:51,819 --> 00:40:01,495
PROBABLY

901
00:40:01,495 --> 00:40:03,097
WHY THE VOTING RIGHTS STUFF

902
00:40:01,495 --> 00:40:03,097
ISN'T WORKING OUT.

903
00:40:01,495 --> 00:40:03,097
THE BOTTOM LINE IS I THINK BIDEN

904
00:40:03,097 --> 00:40:04,832
JUST NEEDS MORE TIME

905
00:40:03,097 --> 00:40:04,832
YOU KNOW, HE MAY BE MORE OF AN

906
00:40:03,097 --> 00:40:04,832
ACQUIRED TASTE

907
00:40:04,832 --> 00:40:07,468
AND UNFORTUNATELY, MOST

908
00:40:04,832 --> 00:40:07,468
AMERICANS RECENTLY LOST THEIR

909
00:40:04,832 --> 00:40:07,468
SENSE OF TASTE

910
00:40:07,468 --> 00:40:11,071
PRESIDENT BIDEN GAVE A SPEECH

911
00:40:07,468 --> 00:40:11,071
IN ATLANTA WHERE HE CALLED ON

912
00:40:07,468 --> 00:40:11,071
THE SENATE TO PASS TWO VOTING

913
00:40:11,071 --> 00:40:14,208
RIGHTS BILLS TO SAY I'M TIRED OF

914
00:40:11,071 --> 00:40:14,208
BEING QUIET.

915
00:40:11,071 --> 00:40:14,208
AND TO PROVE IT HE TOOK A

916
00:40:14,208 --> 00:40:20,481
20-MINUTE STANDING NAP

917
00:40:14,208 --> 00:40:20,481
MINORITY LEADER, MITCH

918
00:40:14,208 --> 00:40:20,481
McCONNELL, SEEN HERE, LOSING THE

919
00:40:20,481 --> 00:40:28,322
BATTLE WITH HIS BREAKFAST

920
00:40:20,481 --> 00:40:28,322
BURRITO, CRITICIZED PRESIDENT

921
00:40:20,481 --> 00:40:28,322
BIDEN'S SPEECH ON VOTING RIGHTS

922
00:40:28,322 --> 00:40:32,493
CALLING IT "BENEATH HIS OFFICE."

923
00:40:28,322 --> 00:40:32,493
COINCIDENTALLY, "BENEATH HIS

924
00:40:28,322 --> 00:40:32,493
OFFICE" IS ALSO WHERE McCONNELL

925
00:40:32,493 --> 00:40:41,335
BURIES THE HOMELESS MEN HE HUNTS

926
00:40:32,493 --> 00:40:41,335
FOR SPORT.

927
00:40:32,493 --> 00:40:41,335
FUN FACT.

928
00:40:41,335 --> 00:40:44,138
REPUBLICANS ARE BEING

929
00:40:41,335 --> 00:40:44,138
CRITICIZED FOR BLOCK THE VOTING

930
00:40:41,335 --> 00:40:44,138
RIGHTS BILL, BUT OF COURSE,

931
00:40:44,138 --> 00:40:48,842
REPUBLICANS DON'T WANT VOTING

932
00:40:44,138 --> 00:40:48,842
RIGHTS BECAUSE IF VOTING WAS

933
00:40:44,138 --> 00:40:48,842
FAIR THEY'D LOSE

934
00:40:48,842 --> 00:40:53,013
IT'S THE SAME REASON I KEEP MY

935
00:40:48,842 --> 00:40:53,013
BASKETBALL HOOP LOWER TO EIGHT

936
00:40:48,842 --> 00:40:53,013
FEET

937
00:40:53,013 --> 00:41:01,889
'CAUSE WITH THE HELP OF A SMALL

938
00:40:53,013 --> 00:41:01,889
LADDER, I CAN DUNK

939
00:40:53,013 --> 00:41:01,889
BUT IF THERE'S ANY SILVER LINING

940
00:41:01,889 --> 00:41:04,558
TO VOTER SUPPRESSION IS THAT

941
00:41:01,889 --> 00:41:04,558
WE'LL NEVER HAVE TO HEAR

942
00:41:01,889 --> 00:41:04,558
REPUBLICANS TRY TO APPEAL TO

943
00:41:04,558 --> 00:41:11,265
BLACK VOTERS

944
00:41:04,558 --> 00:41:11,265
BECAUSE NO ONE WANTS TO HEAR

945
00:41:04,558 --> 00:41:11,265
TED CRUZ SAY "FO' SHIZZEL.

946
00:41:11,265 --> 00:41:16,570
FRANKLY, NO ONE WANTS TO HEAR ME

947
00:41:11,265 --> 00:41:16,570
SAY IT EITHER.

948
00:41:11,265 --> 00:41:16,570
IT'S TOO LATE, IT'S ALREADY A

949
00:41:16,570 --> 00:41:23,277
GIF.

950
00:41:16,570 --> 00:41:23,277
LEADER OF THE OATHKEEPERS

951
00:41:16,570 --> 00:41:23,277
STEWART RHODES HAS BEEN ARRESTED

952
00:41:23,277 --> 00:41:27,448
AND CHARGED WITH SADITIOUS

953
00:41:23,277 --> 00:41:27,448
CONSPIRACY IN CONNECTION WITH

954
00:41:23,277 --> 00:41:27,448
THE JANUARY 6th ATTACK

955
00:41:27,448 --> 00:41:30,651
I DON'T KNOW, HE LOOKS PRETTY

956
00:41:27,448 --> 00:41:30,651
REMORSEFUL

957
00:41:27,448 --> 00:41:30,651
HOPEFULLY HE CAN PATCH THINGS

958
00:41:30,651 --> 00:41:41,462
UP

959
00:41:30,651 --> 00:41:41,462
YEAH

960
00:41:30,651 --> 00:41:41,462
THAT WASN'T AN EYE JOKE.

961
00:41:41,462 --> 00:41:42,996
I WAS BEIN

962
00:41:41,462 --> 00:41:42,996
GENUINE.

963
00:41:41,462 --> 00:41:42,996
RHODES IS BEING ACCUSED OF

964
00:41:42,996 --> 00:41:49,403
MESSAGING HIS RIGHT-WING GROUP

965
00:41:42,996 --> 00:41:49,403
WITH INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO

966
00:41:42,996 --> 00:41:49,403
USE FORCE TO ATTACK THE CAPITOL.

967
00:41:49,403 --> 00:41:55,576
AUTHORITIES KNEW THE MESSAGES

968
00:41:49,403 --> 00:41:55,576
WERE FROM RHODES BECAUSE THEY

969
00:41:49,403 --> 00:41:55,576
ALL BEGAN WITH "ARGG, MATEY.

970
00:41:55,576 --> 00:42:00,781
THAT'S NOT WHAT THAT WAS

971
00:41:55,576 --> 00:42:00,781
THAT WASN'T AN EYE JOKE AT ALL.

972
00:41:55,576 --> 00:42:00,781
IT WASN'T AN EYE JOKE.

973
00:42:00,781 --> 00:42:05,719
NO.

974
00:42:00,781 --> 00:42:05,719
DURING A SENATE COMMITTE

975
00:42:00,781 --> 00:42:05,719
HEARING, DR. ANTHONY FAUCI WAS

976
00:42:05,719 --> 00:42:07,721
HEARD ON A HOT MIKE CALLING

977
00:42:05,719 --> 00:42:07,721
SENATOR ROBERT MARSHAL A MORON

978
00:42:05,719 --> 00:42:07,721
REPLIED MARSHALL, "HEY, WHAT

979
00:42:07,721 --> 00:42:16,697
DOES THAT WORD MEAN?

980
00:42:07,721 --> 00:42:16,697
POPE FRANCIS SAID THIS WEEK

981
00:42:07,721 --> 00:42:16,697
THAT GETTING VACCINATED AGAINST

982
00:42:16,697 --> 00:42:22,336
COVID IS A MORAL OBLIGATION

983
00:42:16,697 --> 00:42:22,336
ESPECIALLY SINCE PRIESTS WORK SO

984
00:42:16,697 --> 00:42:22,336
CLOSELY WITH KIDS.

985
00:42:22,336 --> 00:42:35,382
THAT WASN'T AN EYE JOKE

986
00:42:22,336 --> 00:42:35,382
DELTA AIRLINES SAID COVID

987

00:42:35,382 --> 00:42:40,220
SPIRIT AIRLINES BECAUSE WHEN YOU

991

992
00:42:40,220 --> 00:42:50,964
