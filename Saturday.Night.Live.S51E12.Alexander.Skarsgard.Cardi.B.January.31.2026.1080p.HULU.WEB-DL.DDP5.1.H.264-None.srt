1
00:00:00,436 --> 00:00:03,574
>>> IN RESPONSE TO THE CHAOTIC
SITUATION IN MINNESOTA,

2
00:00:03,574 --> 00:00:06,287
PRESIDENT TRUMP ORDERED WHITE
HOUSE BORDER CZAR TOM HOMAN

3
00:00:06,287 --> 00:00:09,011
TO
TRAVEL TO MINNEAPOLIS AND TAKE
CONTROL OF THE OPERATION.

4
00:00:09,011 --> 00:00:11,315
UPON ARRIVAL, HE MET WITH I.C.E.
UNIT COMMANDERS

5
00:00:11,315 --> 00:00:13,719
TO CLARIFY THE
MISSION OBJECTIVES.

6
00:00:13,719 --> 00:00:16,655
>> ALL RIGHT, EVERYONE.

7
00:00:16,655 --> 00:00:21,257
ALL RIGHT.
THANK YOU.
ALL RIGHT.

8
00:00:21,257 --> 00:00:23,665
ALL RIGHT, EVERYONE, SETTLE
DOWN.

9
00:00:23,665 --> 00:00:25,121
MY NAME IS TOM HOMAN.

10
00:00:25,121 --> 00:00:29,742
NOW I'M SURE A LOT OF YOU ARE
WONDERING WHY GREG BOVINO, THE
LAST GUY, WAS DISMISSED.

11
00:00:29,742 --> 00:00:33,166
I WANT TO STRESS THAT IT WASN'T
BECAUSE HE DID A BAD JOB.

12
00:00:33,166 --> 00:00:36,209
OR PUBLICLY LIED ABOUT THE
SHOOTING OF AN AMERICAN CITIZEN.

13
00:00:36,309 --> 00:00:39,653
OR EVEN, OH-OH, DRESSED LIKE A
NAZI.

14
00:00:39,653 --> 00:00:44,270
IT WAS THAT HE WAS FILMED DOING
THESE THINGS.

15
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:46,762
AND THE PRESIDENT NO LIKEE THAT.

16
00:00:46,762 --> 00:00:49,407
SO I'M HERE NOW, AND WE NEED TO
TIGHTEN UP.

17
00:00:49,407 --> 00:00:51,928
THAT STARTS WITH REMEMBERING THE
MISSION OBJECTIVE.

18
00:00:52,013 --> 00:00:55,338
NOW, WHO CAN TELL ME WHY WE'RE
HERE IN MINNEAPOLIS?

19
00:00:55,338 --> 00:00:57,025
>> PASS.

20
00:00:57,025 --> 00:00:59,679
>> NOPE, CAN'T PASS.

21
00:00:59,751 --> 00:01:02,098
COME ON, GUYS.
WHAT ARE WE DOING IN
MINNEAPOLIS?

22
00:01:02,098 --> 00:01:05,722
>> THIS COULD BE WRONG, BUT
ARMY?

23
00:01:05,722 --> 00:01:08,248
>> CLOSE.
THAT'S CLOSE.

24
00:01:08,248 --> 00:01:12,856
WE'RE HERE TO DETAIN AND DEPORT
ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS WHO HAVE
COMMITTED CRIMES.

25
00:01:12,856 --> 00:01:16,621
>> THAT IS LITERALLY THE FIRST
I'M HEARING OF THAT.

26
00:01:16,621 --> 00:01:18,705
>> WELL, IT SHOULDN'T BE.

27
00:01:18,705 --> 00:01:22,048
JUST SO I KNOW WHAT WERE YOU
TOLD YOU SHOULD BE DOING?

28
00:01:22,048 --> 00:01:24,811
>> UM -- WILDING OUT.

29
00:01:24,811 --> 00:01:27,991
>> FORGET EVERYTHING YOU WERE
TOLD BEFORE.

30
00:01:27,991 --> 00:01:32,513
WE'RE NOT HERE TO INTIMIDATE,
RACIALLY PROFILE, OR VIOLATE
ANYONE'S RIGHTS.

31
00:01:32,513 --> 00:01:35,297
SO AGAIN, WHAT ARE WE LOOKING
FOR?

32
00:01:35,297 --> 00:01:37,417
>> EPSTEIN FILES?

33
00:01:37,417 --> 00:01:39,619
>> NOPE!
NOPE!

34
00:01:39,619 --> 00:01:43,087
WE ACTUALLY JUST RELEASED THOSE
TO DISTRACT FROM THIS.

35
00:01:43,087 --> 00:01:46,997
WHICH IS IRONIC, BECAUSE WE DID
THIS TO DISTRACT FROM THOSE, SO...

36
00:01:46,997 --> 00:01:50,671
ANYWAY, GUYS.
IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT DOING THE MISSION,

37
00:01:50,671 --> 00:01:52,467
IT'S ABOUT DOING IT THE
RIGHT WAY.

38
00:01:52,467 --> 00:01:57,179
A LOT OF THE BAD PRESS WE'RE
GETTING IS COMING FROM THE
AGGRESSIVE TACTICS WE'RE USING.

39
00:01:57,179 --> 00:01:59,128
>> AND THE NAZI COAT.

40
00:01:59,128 --> 00:02:02,724
>> YES, THE NAZI COAT, VERY
GOOD.

41
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:08,538
SO, LET'S TALK ABOUT USE OF
FORCE.

42
00:02:08,538 --> 00:02:10,364
WHEN DO WE WANT TO USE FORCE?

43
00:02:10,364 --> 00:02:12,061
>> RIGHT AWAY?

44
00:02:12,061 --> 00:02:15,021
>> NO.
THINK OF THE OPPOSITE.

45
00:02:15,021 --> 00:02:17,678
>> RIGHT.
PRE-EMPTIVELY.

46
00:02:17,678 --> 00:02:21,323
>> ALSO NO.
IT'S KIND OF A TRICK QUESTION,

47
00:02:21,323 --> 00:02:23,740
BECAUSE WE ACTUALLY DON'T WANT
TO USE FORCE.

48
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:28,844
REMEMBER, THE JOB ULTIMATELY IS
ABOUT KEEPING AMERICA SAFE
FROM -- WHAT?

49
00:02:28,844 --> 00:02:32,406
>> THIS COULD BE WRONG, BUT --
DON LEMON?

50
00:02:32,406 --> 00:02:35,665
>> THAT IS WRONG, YES.

51
00:02:35,665 --> 00:02:37,480
IT'S CRIMINALS.

52
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:39,418
>> TEACHER?

53
00:02:39,418 --> 00:02:42,642
>> NOT A TEACHER.
GO AHEAD.

54
00:02:42,642 --> 00:02:46,537
>> UM -- SOME OF THESE PEOPLE
PROTESTING HAVE GUNS.

55
00:02:46,537 --> 00:02:48,914
THAT SHOULDN'T BE ALLOWED,
RIGHT?

56
00:02:48,914 --> 00:02:51,046
>> WELL, LET'S FLIP IT AROUND,
RIGHT?

57
00:02:51,046 --> 00:02:54,080
HOW MANY OF YOU WENT TO A "STOP
THE STEAL" PROTEST

58
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,926
WITH A LOADED
AUTOMATIC WEAPON?

59
00:02:59,243 --> 00:03:01,706
OKAY.
THAT IS ALL OF YOU.

60
00:03:01,706 --> 00:03:02,991
SO YOU'VE GOT TO DO BETTER.

61
00:03:02,991 --> 00:03:05,674
LOOK, I'M TOM HOMAN, OKAY?

62
00:03:05,674 --> 00:03:10,681
I'M THE -- I'M THE SEPARATING
FAMILIES AT THE BORDER GUY.

63
00:03:10,681 --> 00:03:14,747
I'M THE ON-FILM TAKING A $50,000
BRIBE GUY.

64
00:03:14,747 --> 00:03:19,233
AND Y'ALL ARE MAKING ME LOOK
LIKE THE UPSTANDING, REASONABLE
ADULT IN THE ROOM.
THAT'S CRAZY!

65
00:03:19,233 --> 00:03:21,994
NOW, LET'S OPEN IT UP TO
QUESTIONS, PLEASE.
YES?

66
00:03:22,096 --> 00:03:24,639
>> I HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT THE
LOCAL POLICE.

67
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:29,026
>> THAT'S GREAT.
I WAS HOPING SOMEONE WOULD BRING
THIS UP, BECAUSE THERE'S BEEN
SOME FRICTION THERE.

68
00:03:29,026 --> 00:03:31,295
WHAT'S YOUR QUESTION ABOUT THE
LOCAL POLICE?

69
00:03:31,295 --> 00:03:35,636
>> UM -- HOW COME I WASN'T
ALLOWED TO BE IN THEM?

70
00:03:35,636 --> 00:03:38,322
>> I'M NOT SURE.

71
00:03:38,322 --> 00:03:39,934
YES, YES, YOU.

72
00:03:39,934 --> 00:03:43,588
>> UH, YES.
SO -- I HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT
DESTROYING EVIDENCE.

73
00:03:43,588 --> 00:03:45,228
>> YEAH, LET ME STOP YOU RIGHT
THERE.

74
00:03:45,228 --> 00:03:48,518
YOU SHOULD NEVER, NEVER DESTROY
EVIDENCE.

75
00:03:48,518 --> 00:03:50,833
>> GOT IT.

76
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:55,310
>> DON'T WINK.
DON'T WINK.

77
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:58,425
NOW, WHO ELSE HAS A QUESTION?
YES, YOU?

78
00:03:58,425 --> 00:04:02,224
>> YEAH, HOW COME ALL THE FAST
FOOD IN THIS CITY TASTES LIKE
SPIT?

79
00:04:02,224 --> 00:04:05,150
>> IT'S JUST BEST NOT TO THINK
ABOUT THAT.

80
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:07,801
OKAY.
WE GOT ONE MORE QUESTION.

81
00:04:07,801 --> 00:04:10,953
>> I'M BEING DETAILED TO THE
SUPER BOWL,

82
00:04:10,953 --> 00:04:14,293
BUT I'M LOOKING IN
MY TICKET APP AND I DON'T SEE A
TICKET.

83
00:04:14,293 --> 00:04:18,092
>> RIGHT.
SO YOU WON'T ACTUALLY HAVE A
SEAT.

84
00:04:18,092 --> 00:04:22,922
>> SO WE'RE PLAYING IN IT?
LIKE WHAT?

85
00:04:22,922 --> 00:04:25,459
>> GUYS.
GUYS, NO.
NO.

86
00:04:25,459 --> 00:04:29,325
LET'S RECAP.
WHAT HAVE WE LEARNED TODAY?

87
00:04:29,325 --> 00:04:31,374
>> THIS COULD BE WRONG, BUT --

88
00:04:31,374 --> 00:04:34,128
THAT YOU HIRED A BUNCH OF ANGRY,
AGGRESSIVE GUYS,

89
00:04:34,128 --> 00:04:38,058
GAVE US GUNS,
DIDN'T TRAIN US, SO THIS IS WHAT
YOU WANTED TO HAPPEN?

90
00:04:38,058 --> 00:04:42,010
>> COME ON, MAN, DON'T START
THINKING NOW.

91
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:44,841
DROP AND GIVE ME 20.

92
00:04:44,841 --> 00:04:48,701
>> HOW ABOUT THREE WITH KNEES
GIRL-STYLE?

93
00:04:48,701 --> 00:04:50,669
>> NEVER MIND.
LOOK.

94
00:04:50,669 --> 00:04:55,113
THE SITUATION OUT THERE HAS BEEN
ROUGH, AND WE NEED TO LOWER THE
TEMPERATURE.

95
00:04:55,113 --> 00:04:58,354
SO LET'S GET OUT THERE, LET'S
SHOW SOME RESTRAINT.

96
00:04:58,354 --> 00:05:02,485
LET'S DO OUR JOB WITHOUT
VIOLATING ANYONE'S RIGHTS AS
AMERICANS.

97
00:05:02,485 --> 00:05:05,455
CAN YOU DO THAT?
>> NO.

98
00:05:05,455 --> 00:05:08,949
>> WELL, I HAD TO ASK.
MAYBE JUST TRY NOT TO GET
FILMED.

99
00:05:08,949 --> 00:05:13,414
AND LIVE FROM NEW YORK, IT'S
SATURDAY NIGHT!

100
00:07:11,442 --> 00:07:16,085
MUSICAL

101

HOST
SKARSGARD!

102
00:07:23,242 --> 00:07:28,855
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN --
ALEXANDER SKARSGARD!

103
00:07:47,971 --> 00:07:50,581
>> THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK

104
00:07:50,581 --> 00:07:53,461
I AM INCREDIBLY EXCITED TO BE
HERE TONIGHT,

105
00:07:53,461 --> 00:07:59,275
BECAUSE WE ARE

SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE!

106
00:08:01,993 --> 00:08:06,719
¶ CELEBRATE GOOD TIMES COME ON ¶

107
00:08:10,456 --> 00:08:13,315
NOW, WHEN I WAS A KID, I LOVED
WATCHING THIS SHOW

108
00:08:13,315 --> 00:08:15,940
FROM MY IGLOO
BACK IN STOCKHOLM.

109
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:19,440
BUT DURING THESE MONOLOGUES, I
WOULD NEVER FOCUS ON THE HOST.

110
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:22,309
I WAS MORE INTERESTED IN THE
BAND.

111
00:08:22,309 --> 00:08:24,067
BACK THERE IN THE BACKGROUND.

112
00:08:24,067 --> 00:08:26,933
SOMETIMES LAUGHING.
MORE OFTEN NOT.

113
00:08:26,933 --> 00:08:31,443
BUT ALWAYS OUT OF FOCUS.
NEVER IN THE SPOTLIGHT.

114
00:08:31,443 --> 00:08:33,485
WELL, NOT ON MY WATCH.

115
00:08:33,485 --> 00:08:36,432
CALL ME WILLY WONKA, BECAUSE
TONIGHT,

116
00:08:36,432 --> 00:08:39,293
I'M GOING TO LET THE
LITTLE PEOPLE COOK.

117
00:08:40,433 --> 00:08:43,245
GUYS, GIVE ME SOMETHING.

118
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,620
SEE, I LIKE THAT ONE.

119
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:48,959
NICE RIGHT THERE.
MIC, PLEASE.

120
00:08:49,608 --> 00:08:51,838
COME

121
00:08:54,612 --> 00:08:57,249
WHAT IS YOUR NAME, GOOD SIR?
>> JAMES.

122
00:08:57,249 --> 00:08:59,603

HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN IN THE
BAND?

123
00:08:59,603 --> 00:09:03,955
>> 26 YEARS, BUT
>> THAT'S AMAZING, AMAZING.

124
00:09:03,955 --> 00:09:08,544
HOW ABOUT YOU, IS SIR?
MUST BE PRETTY COOL TO TALK TO
THE HOST, HUH?

125
00:09:08,544 --> 00:09:11,743
>> DEPENDS ON THE HOST.
>> YOU ARE WELCOME.

126
00:09:12,291 --> 00:09:17,814
A FEMALE.
ON GUITAR.

127
00:09:18,658 --> 00:09:23,848
YBANEZ 2000, NO?
>> NO.

128
00:09:23,848 --> 00:09:25,387
>> NO?
THAT'S WHAT I SAID NO.

129
00:09:25,491 --> 00:09:27,634
GREAT BANTER, GUYS.

130
00:09:28,307 --> 00:09:34,207
HEY -- WHO WANTS TO HEAR SOME
FREEFORM JAZZ?

131
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:37,534
THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT.
SHOW ME WHAT YOU GOT.

132
00:09:39,776 --> 00:09:44,317
WHAT HAVE WE GOT HERE?
A LITTLE STRAY SAXOPHONE.

133
00:09:44,317 --> 00:09:47,401
ALWAYS WANTED TO PLAY ONE OF
THOSE.

134
00:09:54,031 --> 00:09:57,949
THAT WAS EASY.
NO, NO, DON'T FOLLOW ME.

135
00:09:57,949 --> 00:10:01,781
FOCUS ON THE LADIES.

136
00:10:10,344 --> 00:10:12,927
POWER

137
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:17,493
YOU

138
00:10:49,924 --> 00:10:53,308
IT FEELS GOOD TO GIVE!

139
00:10:53,308 --> 00:10:56,581
GIVE IT UP FOR THE BAND FOR
REALS.

140
00:10:59,297 --> 00:11:03,349
WE HAVE A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU.
CARDI B IS HERE.

141
00:11:04,027 --> 00:11:06,901
STICK AROUND, WE'LL BE RIGHT
BACK!

142
00:11:36,388 --> 00:11:40,438
THANKS
MOM AND DAD.

143
00:11:40,438 --> 00:11:42,083
>> OF COURSE.

144
00:11:42,083 --> 00:11:44,584
>> WE LOVE YOU, WE LOVE YOU.

145
00:11:44,584 --> 00:11:48,610
>> SHOULD WE HEAD TO THE
RESTAURANT?
I'M STARVING.

146
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:49,965
>> OH, YEAH.
>> SURE.

147
00:11:50,047 --> 00:11:53,513
>> OH, OH -- WAIT.
WAIT, THERE'S --

148
00:11:53,623 --> 00:11:56,552
THERE'S
SOMETHING I NEED TO TELL YOU ALL
FIRST.

149
00:11:56,552 --> 00:11:59,973
>> OH, OKAY, WHAT IS IT, MOM?
>> IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

150
00:11:59,973 --> 00:12:04,310
>> I'M ONLY GOING TO SAY IT IF,
AFTER I DO,

151
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:07,862
YOU PROMISE YOU WILL
NOT REACT.

152
00:12:07,862 --> 00:12:12,011
NO TALKING.
NO FACES.

153
00:12:12,011 --> 00:12:14,265
NO NOTHING.

154
00:12:14,265 --> 00:12:18,596
>> MOM, WHAT IS GOING ON?
>> YEAH, YOU'RE SCARING US.

155
00:12:18,596 --> 00:12:23,968
>> THE THING I'M GOING TO SAY --
IS SHOCKING.

156
00:12:23,968 --> 00:12:27,300
AND IT'S GOING TO MAKE YOU WANT
TO REACT.

157
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:31,492
BUT I NEED YOU TO PROMISE THAT
YOU WILL NOT.

158
00:12:31,492 --> 00:12:33,479
>> FINE.
>> SURE, YEAH.

159
00:12:33,479 --> 00:12:34,924
>> LET'S DO A PRACTICE EXAMPLE.

160
00:12:34,924 --> 00:12:39,109
I EAT BUGS.
I EAT BUGS.

161
00:12:40,087 --> 00:12:41,664
>> MOM.
IS THAT --

162
00:12:41,664 --> 00:12:44,600
>> NO, NO, WHAT DID I SAY?
>> SORRY, SORRY.

163
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,514
>> NO SPEAKING.

164
00:12:46,514 --> 00:12:49,496
NO TALKING.
NO NOTHING.

165
00:12:49,496 --> 00:12:51,238
PRACTICE EXAMPLE.

166
00:12:51,238 --> 00:12:53,044
MY BUTT FELL OFF, I CAN'T FIND
IT.

167
00:12:53,044 --> 00:12:55,641
I DON'T HAVE A BUTT.

168
00:12:58,657 --> 00:13:01,062
OKAY, GOOD.

169
00:13:01,456 --> 00:13:04,348
WHAT I HAVE TO TELL YOU --

170
00:13:05,029 --> 00:13:09,329
IS I MAY HAVE CHANGED MY MIND --

171
00:13:10,372 --> 00:13:13,426
ABOUT TRUMP.

172
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:18,121
>> WHAT?
>> YEAH!

173
00:13:18,121 --> 00:13:22,114
>> STOP IT, STOP IT!
YOU WANT THIS TO BE REAL OR NOT?

174
00:13:22,114 --> 00:13:25,227
>> YES!
>> SURE, YEAH.

175
00:13:28,012 --> 00:13:31,597
>> I FEEL NOW --

176
00:13:31,597 --> 00:13:35,263
LIKE HE MIGHT BE --

177
00:13:35,788 --> 00:13:38,275
BAD FOR OUR COUNTRY.

178
00:13:38,275 --> 00:13:40,068
>> OH, I DO!
>> STOP IT!

179
00:13:40,068 --> 00:13:43,813
WHAT DID I SAY, WHAT DID I SAY?

180
00:13:44,007 --> 00:13:47,342
>> I'M SORRY, MOM, YOU'VE GOT TO
BE JOKING.

181
00:13:47,342 --> 00:13:49,509
>> WE'VE BEEN SAYING THIS SINCE
2016.

182
00:13:49,509 --> 00:13:51,837
>> OH, I'M SORRY I'M LATE TO THE
PERFECT PARTY.

183
00:13:51,837 --> 00:13:54,401
DO YOU GUYS WANT THIS TO BE REAL
OR NOT?

184
00:13:54,401 --> 00:13:55,754
>> YES!
>> YES, ABSOLUTE.

185
00:13:55,754 --> 00:14:00,288
>> WE WANT IT TO BE REAL.
>> THEN GIVE ME GRACE.

186
00:14:04,465 --> 00:14:10,435
I FEEL LIKE -- MAYBE --

187
00:14:10,435 --> 00:14:13,808
SOME OF THE THINGS HE SAYS --

188
00:14:13,808 --> 00:14:16,175
AREN'T TRUE.

189
00:14:16,175 --> 00:14:18,054
>> OH!
>> MOM!

190
00:14:18,194 --> 00:14:21,795
>> BYE, I TAKE IT BACK!

191
00:14:21,795 --> 00:14:24,606
>> MOM, COME ON.
DON'T DO THAT.

192
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:28,241
>> GUYS, COME ON, CAN'T YOU SEE
THIS IS HARD FOR YOUR MOTHER?

193
00:14:28,241 --> 00:14:33,984
ALSO, I WANT TO REMIND
EVERYBODY, IT IS MY BIRTHDAY.

194
00:14:33,984 --> 00:14:35,732
>> AND GREG, WE ARE GOING TO GET
TO THAT.

195
00:14:35,732 --> 00:14:37,926
AND FOR THE RECORD, YOU LITTLE BRATS,

196
00:14:37,926 --> 00:14:40,493
I DO STILL THINK HE'S A
GOOD BUSINESSMAN.

197
00:14:40,493 --> 00:14:42,819
>> MOM, COME ON.

198
00:14:42,819 --> 00:14:45,640
>> THIS IS WHY NOBODY LIKES YOUR
SIDE!

199
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:47,304
YOU THINK YOU KNOW EVERYTHING

200
00:14:47,304 --> 00:14:50,656
WITH YOUR MACHO RAPPING HAMILTON
AND YOUR IUDs.

201
00:14:50,656 --> 00:14:53,302
JUST HAVE KIDS ALREADY!

202
00:14:53,302 --> 00:14:55,733
>> WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

203
00:14:55,733 --> 00:14:58,857
>> MAYBE WE COULD TALK ABOUT
THIS AT RED ROBIN'S.

204
00:14:58,857 --> 00:15:03,367
I'M AFRAID THEY'RE GOING TO GIVE
OUR TABLE AWAY, AND I WANT MY
BIRTHDAY SCOOP.

205
00:15:03,367 --> 00:15:07,796
>> OKAY, MOM, WE'RE SORRY, WE'LL
BE QUIET.
JUST SAY WHAT YOU NEED TO SAY.

206
00:15:07,796 --> 00:15:12,615
>> FINE.
BUT I SWEAR TO GOD --

207
00:15:12,615 --> 00:15:15,430
IF I HEAR A SINGLE "I TOLD YOU SO,"

208
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:19,091
I WILL GO SEE THE "MELANIA"
MOVIE TONIGHT.

209
00:15:19,091 --> 00:15:20,792
YOU HEAR ME?

210
00:15:20,886 --> 00:15:24,187
>> OKAY.
>> REALLY

211
00:15:24,187 --> 00:15:27,028
>> THEN I WILL SPEAK.

212
00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:32,753
THE THINGS THAT ARE HAPPENING --

213
00:15:32,753 --> 00:15:36,958
NO ONE COULD HAVE SEEN COMING.

214
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:47,060
I FEEL LIKE -- THE WAY THEY TALK
ABOUT GUNS --

215
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:52,405
IS DIFFERENT --
FOR DIFFERENT PEOPLE.

216
00:15:56,995 --> 00:15:59,915
THEY MADE ME FEEL WORRIED --

217
00:15:59,915 --> 00:16:02,448
ABOUT TRANS PEOPLE.

218
00:16:02,448 --> 00:16:05,174
BUT NOW I'M REALIZING --

219
00:16:05,174 --> 00:16:09,509
I DON'T REALLY GET WHAT THE PROBLEM IS.

220
00:16:13,172 --> 00:16:16,191
I'M STARTING TO WONDER --

221
00:16:16,191 --> 00:16:21,877
IF DRAG QUEENS -- ARE ACTUALLY
HILARIOUS.

222
00:16:22,599 --> 00:16:25,425
OH, STOP THAT, I SEE WHAT YOU'RE
DOING!
STOP IT!

223
00:16:25,425 --> 00:16:28,270
>> ENOUGH, ENOUGH, LEAVE YOUR
MOTHER ALONE.

224
00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:32,927
HER LAPTOP IS OLD, SHE GETS A
DIFFERENT INTERNET THAN YOU.

225
00:16:32,927 --> 00:16:34,672
>> NOT HOW THAT WORKS.

226
00:16:34,672 --> 00:16:38,334
>> THAT IS HOW THAT WORKS, AND
THIS IS VULNERABLE FOR ME, OKAY?

227
00:16:38,334 --> 00:16:40,941
YOU SHOULD UNDERSTAND.
WHAT DID I SAY WHEN YOU CAME
OUT?

228
00:16:40,941 --> 00:16:44,994
>> YOU SAID, IS IT POSSIBLE YOU
JUST LIKE HATS?

229
00:16:44,994 --> 00:16:47,833
>> STILL WAITING ON THE ANSWER,
BABE.

230
00:16:47,833 --> 00:16:50,560
>> PLEASE STOP GETTING YOUR
MOTHER WORKED UP.

231
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:53,411
OR SHE WON'T DANCE FOR ME
TONIGHT.

232
00:16:53,411 --> 00:16:57,163
DANCE
>> YOU WOULDN'T BE HERE WITHOUT
IT.

233
00:16:57,163 --> 00:16:59,604
>> OKAY, RELAX.

234
00:16:59,604 --> 00:17:02,723
MOM, WE'RE SORRY.
YOU'RE RIGHT.

235
00:17:02,723 --> 00:17:05,930
WE SHOULDN'T HAVE MADE THIS HARD
FOR YOU, AND WE'RE HAPPY THAT
YOU TOLD US.

236
00:17:05,930 --> 00:17:08,757
>> YEAH.
>> WE'RE SORRY.
>> THANKS, MOM.

237
00:17:08,757 --> 00:17:12,480
>> ALL RIGHT.
LET'S GET TO DINNER.

238
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,554
PLENTY OF ROOM IN THE
CYBERTRUCK.

239
00:17:14,554 --> 00:17:17,792
>> SELL THAT!
>> ARE YOU KIDDING?

240
00:17:22,546 --> 00:17:25,294
>>> THE WINTER OLYMPICS ARE A
WEEK AWAY.

241
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:29,884
NOW MEET SOME OF THE ATHLETES
WHO PUSHED THEMSELVES TO THE
LIMIT OF HUMAN ENDURANCE

242
00:17:29,961 --> 00:17:33,289
FOR THE
CHANCE TO COMPETE AT THE GAMES
IN MILAN.

243
00:17:33,289 --> 00:17:35,222
>> NO ONE SAID IT WOULD BE EASY,

244
00:17:35,222 --> 00:17:38,191
BUT IT'S ALL WORTH IT WHEN I'M
OUT ON THE SLOPES WITH MY BOARD.

245
00:17:38,191 --> 00:17:40,814
>> WHEN I'M ON THE ICE, I FEEL
ALIVE.

246
00:17:40,814 --> 00:17:42,720
IT'S MY PURPOSE.

247
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:46,501
>> I HATE THE LUGE.
IT'S WAY TOO FAST.

248
00:17:46,501 --> 00:17:49,996
IT SCARES ME TO DEATH AND I
SERIOUSLY HATE IT.

249
00:17:49,997 --> 00:17:52,516
SPORTS

250
00:17:52,516 --> 00:17:56,097
>> I'VE BEEN WANTING THIS MY
WHOLE LIFE.
I'M LIVING MY DREAM.

251
00:17:56,097 --> 00:17:59,015
>> THIS IS A NIGHTMARE.
I HATE THE THING I'M GOOD AT.

252
00:17:59,015 --> 00:18:01,044
>> OVER 2,000 ATHLETES.

253
00:18:01,044 --> 00:18:04,313
BUT ONLY THE BEST OF THE BEST
WILL BRING HOME THE GOLD.

254
00:18:04,313 --> 00:18:07,089
>> I'VE TRAINED FOR THIS SINCE I
WAS 4 YEARS OLD.

255
00:18:07,089 --> 00:18:09,530
>> YOU'VE JUST GOT TO WANT IT.
NO ONE'S BORN THE BEST.

256
00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:13,979
>> IN LUGE, BEING THE BEST IS
SORT OF JUST THE HEIGHT AND
WEIGHT DISTRIBUTION THING.

257
00:18:13,979 --> 00:18:17,359
I HONESTLY THINK A CORPSE THAT'S
MY SAME SHAPE COULD WIN.

258
00:18:17,359 --> 00:18:20,062
>> EVERY ATHLETE BRINGS
SOMETHING DIFFERENT TO THE
TABLE.

259
00:18:20,062 --> 00:18:22,487
>> WHAT MAKES ME UNIQUE?
DEFINITELY MY SLOPE STYLE.

260
00:18:22,488 --> 00:18:24,406
CLEAN

261
00:18:24,406 --> 00:18:28,110
>> MY SIGNATURE MOVE IS
DEFINITELY MY ENGLISH TRIPLE
AXEL.

262
00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:30,873
>> I JUST GO STRAIGHT DOWN LIKE
EVERYONE.

263
00:18:30,873 --> 00:18:34,064
BUT I SCREAM THE WHOLE TIME.

264
00:18:38,634 --> 00:18:42,221
>> AND BEHIND EVERY OLYMPIAN IS
AN EQUALLY DEDICATED COACH.

265
00:18:42,221 --> 00:18:45,153
>> COACHING CLARE HAS BEEN ONE
OF THE GREATEST GIFTS OF MY
LIFE.

266
00:18:45,153 --> 00:18:48,886
>> COACHING GARDI IS A BATTLE.

267
00:18:48,886 --> 00:18:52,848
TRYING TO GET HER ON THE SLED,
GET HER DOWN THE HILL.

268
00:18:52,848 --> 00:18:56,803
GET HER TO STOP FREAKING OUT AND
PRETENDING TO BE SICK, ET
CETERA?

269
00:18:56,803 --> 00:18:58,190
>> I'M SICK!
>> YOU'RE NOT SICK.

270
00:18:58,190 --> 00:19:01,016
>> I'M SICK!
>> GO DOWN, GO DOWN.

271
00:19:01,016 --> 00:19:03,710
OH, LOOK AT THAT SPIDER!

272
00:19:05,066 --> 00:19:09,088
>> THE SPORT NEEDS HER.
SHE'S A ONCE-IN-A-GENERATION

273
00:19:09,088 --> 00:19:10,378
SHAPE.

274
00:19:10,378 --> 00:19:14,323
>> THEY'RE NOT JUST PLAYING FOR
THEMSELVES.
THEY'RE PLAYING FOR US ALL.

275
00:19:14,323 --> 00:19:16,057
>> I'M DOING THIS FOR YOU, MOM.

276
00:19:16,057 --> 00:19:18,258
>> I'M SO PROUD OF MY LITTLE
GIRL.

277
00:19:18,258 --> 00:19:22,150
I'VE BEEN CHEERING HER ON SINCE
SHE WON HER VERY FIRST EVENT.

278
00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:26,095
>> AFTER YEARS OF PREPARATION,
IT'S GO TIME FOR THE ATHLETES.

279
00:19:26,095 --> 00:19:28,600
>> I'M LOCKED IN.
NO DISTRACTIONS.

280
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:31,911
>> FOR COMPETITION, THE NAME OF
THE GAME IS FOCUS.

281
00:19:31,911 --> 00:19:34,010
>> THE NAME OF THE GAME IS TO CONFUSE 

282
00:19:34,010 --> 00:19:36,497
AND ULTIMATELY SILENCE
MY SURVIVAL INSTINCTS.

283
00:19:36,497 --> 00:19:39,129
>> SEE IF THEY HAVE WHAT IT
TAKES TO WIN.

284
00:19:39,129 --> 00:19:41,646
>> WE'LL SEE YOU IN MILAN!

285
00:19:41,646 --> 00:19:44,392
>> NOT ME, THOUGH, BECAUSE I'M
SICK, I CAN'T GO.

286
00:19:44,392 --> 00:19:46,400
CAN

287
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,776
>> THE WINTER OLYMPICS IN MILAN.

288
00:19:48,776 --> 00:19:51,060
GO FOR THE GOLD.

289
00:19:56,593 --> 00:20:00,829
>>> ALL RIGHT, EVERYONE.
I AM THRILLED TO BE BACK IN OSLO, 

290
00:20:00,829 --> 00:20:04,723
TO BE DIRECTING THIS
MOVIE, "STENCH OF A FAMILY."

291
00:20:04,723 --> 00:20:07,988
I AM OBSESSED WITH SCANDINAVIAN
CINEMA.

292
00:20:07,988 --> 00:20:11,262
I JUST LOVE HOW YOU GUYS SO
BRAVELY REFLECT

293
00:20:11,262 --> 00:20:14,254
 HOW FAMILY LIFE
IS JUST HARROWING.

294
00:20:14,254 --> 00:20:17,085
SO LET'S GO FOR A TAKE, YEAH?

00:20:25,212 --> 00:20:27,718
>> LOOK AT ME WITH THIS.

298
00:20:27,718 --> 00:20:30,135
>> FATHER IS DYING UPSTAIRS, 

299
00:20:30,135 --> 00:20:33,616
AND YOU DO NOT HAVE THE NERVE TO SEE
HIM?

300
00:20:33,808 --> 00:20:36,618

00:20:41,982 --> 00:20:46,552
I USED TO PAINT.
BUT NOW I JUST WIPE.

00:27:43,529 --> 00:27:46,897
WE STAY SILENT.

469
00:27:46,899 --> 00:27:48,332
VERY INTENT.

470
00:27:48,334 --> 00:27:50,434
THEN ONE DAY, FINALLY, WE DIE.

471
00:27:52,605 --> 00:27:55,406
>> OKAY.

472
00:27:55,408 --> 00:27:55,973
THAT'S SPOOKY, HEIKE.

473
00:27:58,444 --> 00:28:00,744
ME AND MY WIFE, WE DON'T DO

474
00:28:00,746 --> 00:28:01,178
THAT.

475
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:02,279
WE SCREAM, SCREAM, SCREAM, AND

476
00:28:02,281 --> 00:28:04,448
THEN IT GET QUIET.

477
00:28:04,450 --> 00:28:06,150
AND THEN I SAY, YOU WANT TO HAVE

478
00:28:06,152 --> 00:28:06,650
SEX WITH ME, BABY?

479
00:28:10,156 --> 00:28:10,754
AND USUALLY SHE SAY NO.

480
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:15,826
KEVIN, HOW DO YOU HANDLE THIS?

481
00:28:15,828 --> 00:28:17,628
>> WELL, IT'S FUNNY YOU BRING

482
00:28:17,630 --> 00:28:18,395
THAT UP.

483
00:28:18,397 --> 00:28:19,830
RECENTLY, ME AND MY WIFE GOT

484
00:28:19,832 --> 00:28:21,932
INTO A LITTLE TIFF BECAUSE SHE

485
00:28:21,934 --> 00:28:23,801
THINKS I'M TOO AFFECTIONATE WITH

486
00:28:23,803 --> 00:28:25,069
OUR SON.

487
00:28:25,071 --> 00:28:25,636
BUT THAT IS NOT TRUE.

488
00:28:25,638 --> 00:28:30,240
RIGHT, CONNER?

489
00:28:30,242 --> 00:28:30,908
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

490
00:28:30,910 --> 00:28:32,309
YOU'RE THE BEST DAD EVER.

491
00:28:32,311 --> 00:28:33,043
>> ONLY BECAUSE YOU'RE THE BEST

492
00:28:33,045 --> 00:28:35,679
SON EVER.

493
00:28:35,681 --> 00:28:37,915
>> OH!

494
00:28:37,917 --> 00:28:40,818
NO, NO!

495
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:42,953
NO, NO, NO!

496
00:28:42,955 --> 00:28:43,620
DON'T DO IT HERE!

497
00:28:48,861 --> 00:28:52,096
>> I MEAN, I'M SURE YOUR DADS

498
00:28:52,098 --> 00:28:54,898
SHOWED AFFECTION TO YOU, RIGHT,

499
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:55,199
HEIKE?

500
00:28:55,201 --> 00:28:57,101
>> ONE TIME, ME AND MY FATHER

501
00:28:57,103 --> 00:28:58,869
WERE SITTING IN A SAUNA.

502
00:28:58,871 --> 00:28:59,837
AND OUR KNEECAPS ACCIDENTALLY

503
00:28:59,839 --> 00:29:00,170
TOUCHED.

504
00:29:02,975 --> 00:29:03,974
AND HE SAID, "TELL NO ONE OF

505
00:29:03,976 --> 00:29:04,274
THIS."

506
00:29:12,451 --> 00:29:13,183
>> I TOLD YOU, TELL NO ONE OF

507
00:29:13,185 --> 00:29:13,484
THIS.

508
00:29:16,222 --> 00:29:17,955
>> FORGIVE ME, FATHER.

509
00:29:17,957 --> 00:29:19,490
>> THE SHAME IS YOURS!

510
00:29:19,492 --> 00:29:22,626
LIVE WITH IT!

511
00:29:32,204 --> 00:29:32,769
>> WHITE PEOPLE, VERY

512
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:33,170
INTERESTING.

513
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:38,175
THEY NEVER SCREAM, YOU KNOW?

514
00:29:38,177 --> 00:29:40,611
THEY JUST PUSH IT DOWN, DOWN,

515
00:29:40,613 --> 00:29:40,911
DOWN.

516
00:29:40,913 --> 00:29:42,813
AND THEN ONE DAY, THEY KILL

517
00:29:42,815 --> 00:29:43,380
THEIR WIFE, HA HA HA!

518
00:29:45,951 --> 00:29:48,385
ME AND MY WIFE, WE HAVE A

519
00:29:48,387 --> 00:29:49,953
BEAUTIFUL RELATIONSHIP.

520
00:29:49,955 --> 00:29:52,222
BECAUSE I DO WHATEVER I WANT.

521
00:29:52,224 --> 00:29:53,423
BECAUSE IT'S MY HOUSE, AND IT'S

522
00:29:53,425 --> 00:29:53,924
MY RULES.

526
00:30:07,239 --> 00:30:09,640

ME, BABY?

530
00:30:13,712 --> 00:30:14,778
THESE ARE MY FRIENDS.

531
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:15,546
NO, NO, NO!

532
00:30:15,548 --> 00:30:17,781
>> WHITE PEOPLE IN MY HOUSE.

533
00:30:17,783 --> 00:30:23,086
>> I KNOW, I KNOW.

534
00:30:23,088 --> 00:30:24,354
>> YOU DON'T MUCH ATTENTION.

535
00:30:24,356 --> 00:30:25,789
SMOKING IN MY HOUSE?

536
00:30:25,791 --> 00:30:30,460
HAVING THESE PEOPLE EAT MY FOOD?

537
00:30:30,462 --> 00:30:31,461
SICK OF YOU.

538
00:30:31,463 --> 00:30:32,129
>> DO YOU WANT TO HAVE SEX,

539
00:30:32,131 --> 00:30:36,633
BABY?

540
00:30:36,635 --> 00:30:37,601
OH, MY GOD, OKAY.

541
00:30:37,603 --> 00:30:39,169
THAT'S ALL THE TIME WE HAVE

TONIGHT WE FEAST!

>> ARE YOU OKAY, EIFAR?

558
00:31:35,861 --> 00:31:36,927

559
00:31:36,929 --> 00:31:40,330
OUT.

00:31:41,233 --> 00:31:41,765
>> YEAH.

562
00:31:41,767 --> 00:31:44,067
I FEEL LIKE THE GROUP IS GETTING

563
00:31:44,069 --> 00:31:44,935
KIND OF CLIQUEY.

564
00:31:44,937 --> 00:31:46,803
>> CLIQUEY?

565
00:31:46,805 --> 00:31:49,640
>> I'M JUST -- ALONE.

566
00:31:49,642 --> 00:31:51,375
COOL, THAT'S GREAT, FINE.

567
00:31:51,377 --> 00:31:53,510
>> WE HAD NO IDEA.

568
00:31:53,512 --> 00:31:55,045
WHAT DID WE DO TO MAKE YOU FEEL

569
00:31:55,047 --> 00:31:55,746
LIKE THAT?

570
00:31:55,748 --> 00:31:58,282
>> LITTLE STUFF.

571
00:31:58,284 --> 00:32:01,118
LIKE RAGNAR DURING THE RAIDS, I

572
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:03,320
SAW YOU AND SNORR CUTTING A GUY

573
00:32:03,322 --> 00:32:03,954
IN HALF.

574
00:32:03,956 --> 00:32:05,389
AND I WAS STANDING RIGHT NEXT TO

575
00:32:05,391 --> 00:32:07,524
YOU READY WITH MY SWORD, AND NO

576
00:32:07,526 --> 00:32:08,925
ONE EVEN THOUGHT OF LIKE, HEY,

577
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:09,660
AT SOME POINT MAYBE YOU WANT TO

578
00:32:09,662 --> 00:32:13,930
JOIN US?

579
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:19,169
>> I'M SORRY, MAN.

580
00:32:19,571 --> 00:32:22,639
>> AND THEN, LIKE, THIS IS MAYBE

581
00:32:22,641 --> 00:32:23,640
KIND OF STUPID.

582
00:32:23,642 --> 00:32:24,908
BUT WHEN WE WERE PLAYING

583
00:32:24,910 --> 00:32:25,609
FOOTBALL, NOBODY PASSED IT TO

584
00:32:25,611 --> 00:32:28,545
ME.

585
00:32:28,547 --> 00:32:31,381
MAYBE I'M OVERREACTING, BUT I

586
00:32:31,383 --> 00:32:32,716
FEEL LIKE THIS WEIRD TENSION IN

587
00:32:32,718 --> 00:32:33,517
THE GROUP.

588
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:34,651
>> AND I FEEL TERRIBLE.

589
00:32:34,653 --> 00:32:36,853
I DON'T EVEN WANT TO FINISH

590
00:32:36,855 --> 00:32:39,489
SEWING A GOAT HEAD ON THIS MONK.

591
00:32:39,491 --> 00:32:40,324
>> THIS IS WHY I DIDN'T WANT TO

592
00:32:40,326 --> 00:32:42,259
BRING IT OUT, I DIDN'T WANT TO

593
00:32:42,261 --> 00:32:42,993
BUM EVERYONE OUT.

594
00:32:42,995 --> 00:32:44,094
WE SHOULD BE HAPPY RIGHT NOW.

595
00:32:44,096 --> 00:32:45,662
>> IT'S HARD TO BE HAPPY WHEN

596
00:32:45,664 --> 00:32:47,030
YOU REALIZE YOU'VE BEEN ACTING

597
00:32:47,032 --> 00:32:49,132
LIKE A FIRST-CLASS A-HOLE.

598
00:32:49,134 --> 00:32:51,535
>> NO-PENIS, STOP.

599
00:32:51,537 --> 00:32:53,737
I'M OVER IT.

600
00:32:53,739 --> 00:32:55,872
LET'S SKIN THIS CHRISTIAN, MAKE

601
00:32:55,874 --> 00:32:57,507
A HAT OUT OF HIS SKIN, STAY

602
00:32:57,509 --> 00:32:58,642
HOME, AND FORGET ABOUT THE WHOLE

603
00:32:58,644 --> 00:32:59,042
THING, OKAY?

604
00:32:59,044 --> 00:33:02,279
>> NO.

605
00:33:02,281 --> 00:33:03,680
MAKE A HAT OUT OF ME?

606
00:33:03,682 --> 00:33:04,748
IT'S NOT GOING TO SOLVE WHAT'S

607
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:06,083
GOING ON WITH THE GROUP.

608
00:33:06,085 --> 00:33:07,784
>> THIS CHRISTIAN IS RIGHT.

609
00:33:07,786 --> 00:33:09,453
>> FIRST TIME FOR EVERYTHING.

610
00:33:09,455 --> 00:33:10,754
>> HA HA HA!

611
00:33:10,756 --> 00:33:13,523
>> THAT'S VERY FUNNY.

612
00:33:13,525 --> 00:33:16,760
BUT I THINK EIFAR, MAYBE SOME OF

613
00:33:16,762 --> 00:33:17,527
WHAT YOU'RE FEELING IS JEALOUSY.

614
00:33:17,529 --> 00:33:21,198
>> OH.

615
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:24,067
>> JEALOUSY -- OF YOU.

616
00:33:24,069 --> 00:33:25,035
>> WHAT?

617
00:33:25,037 --> 00:33:27,404
>> WE WORSHIP YOU, MAN.

618
00:33:27,406 --> 00:33:29,339
>> ANY COLDNESS YOU FELT WASN'T

619
00:33:29,341 --> 00:33:30,674
BECAUSE WE DIDN'T LIKE YOU BUT

620
00:33:30,676 --> 00:33:33,710
BECAUSE WE WERE AFRAID YOU

621
00:33:33,712 --> 00:33:34,211
WOULDN'T LIKE US.

622
00:33:34,213 --> 00:33:37,414
>> ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

623
00:33:37,416 --> 00:33:40,751
YOU GUYS ARE THE BEST.

624
00:33:40,753 --> 00:33:43,587
>> CUT TO ME TELLING MY WIFE MY

625
00:33:43,589 --> 00:33:45,188
HERO THINKS I'M THE BEST.

626
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:45,922
SHE'S LIKE, YEAH, OKAY, LIAR.

627
00:33:45,924 --> 00:33:48,792

I'M SO NOT YOUR HERO.

629
00:33:50,295 --> 00:33:52,162
>> YOU'RE EVERYONE'S HERO.

630
00:33:52,164 --> 00:33:54,664
WHEN I WAS A TEENAGER, I HAD A

631
00:33:54,666 --> 00:33:58,869
RUNE OF YOU ON MY BEDROOM WALL.

632
00:33:58,871 --> 00:33:59,202

633
00:33:59,204 --> 00:34:00,103
DOING THAT COOL POSE.

634
00:34:00,105 --> 00:34:03,306
>> WHAT COOL POSE?

635
00:34:03,308 --> 00:34:05,375
>> YOU MEAN THIS COOL POSE?

636
00:34:05,377 --> 00:34:06,176
>> YES!

637
00:34:06,178 --> 00:34:07,544

976
00:47:14,115 --> 00:47:16,716
>> DOES MY HAIR LOOK OKAY?

977
00:47:16,718 --> 00:47:20,419
>> YOU'RE AMAZING.

978
00:47:20,421 --> 00:47:20,853
>> ALL RIGHT.

979
00:47:23,925 --> 00:47:25,391
IT'S GREAT TO HAVE YOU GUYS

980
00:47:25,393 --> 00:47:25,691
BACK.

981
00:47:25,693 --> 00:47:26,692
SO YOU'RE HERE TO TALK ABOUT THE

982
00:47:26,694 --> 00:47:27,093
SUPER BOWL?

983
00:47:27,095 --> 00:47:31,864
>> YES, YES.

984
00:47:31,866 --> 00:47:33,266
WE ARE HERE TO DISCUSS THE SUPER

985
00:47:33,268 --> 00:47:33,566
BOWL.

986
00:47:33,568 --> 00:47:34,333
THE PATRIOTS AND SEAHAWKS PLAYED

987
00:47:34,335 --> 00:47:35,668
EACH OTHER IN THE SUPER BOWL IN

988
00:47:35,670 --> 00:47:35,968
2016.

989
00:47:35,970 --> 00:47:37,904
>> IT'S ONE THING TO PLAY A TEAM

990
00:47:37,906 --> 00:47:38,638
ONCE, BUT TO GET ANOTHER CHANCE

991
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:40,006
TO PLAY THEM AGAIN -- THAT'S

992
00:47:40,008 --> 00:47:41,040
JUST OUT OF THIS WORLD.

993
00:47:46,514 --> 00:47:49,181
>> UH-HUH, YEAH.

994
00:47:49,183 --> 00:47:50,416
SO, HOW DO YOU PICTURE THIS

995
00:47:50,418 --> 00:47:51,617
SECOND TIME PLAYING OUT?

996
00:47:51,619 --> 00:47:52,518
>> WELL, LOOK.

997
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:54,186
THE SEAHAWKS HAVEN'T WON THE

998
00:47:54,188 --> 00:47:55,621
SUPER BOWL IN QUITE SOME TIME,

999
00:47:55,623 --> 00:47:56,889
SO THEY JUST NEED TO GET OUT

1000
00:47:56,891 --> 00:47:57,890
THERE ON THE FIELD AND SAY TO

1001
00:47:57,892 --> 00:47:58,424
THE PATRIOTS, HEY!

1002
00:47:58,426 --> 00:48:01,193
REMEMBER ME?

1003
00:48:03,932 --> 00:48:04,964
>> HOW COULD I FORGET?

1004
00:48:06,801 --> 00:48:09,201
>> OKAY.

1005
00:48:09,203 --> 00:48:10,736
AND THEN WHAT?

1006
00:48:10,738 --> 00:48:13,639
>> UM -- AND THEN -- MAYBE THE

1007
00:48:13,641 --> 00:48:17,610
SEAHAWKS SAY -- ARE WE DOING

1008
00:48:17,612 --> 00:48:18,010
THIS AGAIN?

1009
00:48:21,215 --> 00:48:21,948
>> AND -- MAYBE THE PATRIOTS ARE

1010
00:48:21,950 --> 00:48:24,283
LIKE -- I WANT TO SO BAD.

1011
00:48:28,790 --> 00:48:31,424
>> BUT MAYBE THE SEAHAWKS ARE

1012
00:48:31,426 --> 00:48:33,292
SCARED BECAUSE -- THEY HAVEN'T

1013
00:48:33,294 --> 00:48:37,363
BEEN TO THE SUPER BOWL, GOSH --

1014
00:48:37,365 --> 00:48:37,830
NOT SINCE JASON.

1015
00:48:41,135 --> 00:48:42,902
>> I'M SORRY, WHO'S JASON?

1016
00:48:42,904 --> 00:48:43,602
HE'S A PLAYER?

1017
00:48:43,604 --> 00:48:43,903
>> HA.

1018
00:48:43,905 --> 00:48:44,437
YOU COULD SAY THAT.

1019
00:48:47,041 --> 00:48:47,907
>> OKAY, ALL RIGHT.

1020
00:48:47,909 --> 00:48:50,142
THE SEAHAWKS FAMOUSLY LOST ON

1021
00:48:50,144 --> 00:48:51,911
THE 1 YARD LINE IN 2015.

1022
00:48:51,913 --> 00:48:52,678
DO YOU THINK THIS GAME WILL BE

1023
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:53,079
THAT CLOSE?

1024
00:48:53,081 --> 00:48:55,014
>> YEAH, LOOK, FOOTBALL IS

1025
00:48:55,016 --> 00:48:56,649
FAMOUSLY A GAME OF INCHES.

1026
00:48:56,651 --> 00:48:57,416
EVERYBODY WANTS TO GO FOR SEVEN.

1027
00:48:57,418 --> 00:49:01,020
BUT -- SOMETIMES IT'S BETTER TO

1028
00:49:01,022 --> 00:49:01,821
TAKE THE THREE.

1029
00:49:14,969 --> 00:49:16,969
>> THREE?

1030
00:49:16,971 --> 00:49:17,903
>> ONE.

1031
00:49:20,174 --> 00:49:21,540
>> GOD, ONE?

1032
00:49:24,946 --> 00:49:26,579
>> LOOK, COLIN.

1033
00:49:26,581 --> 00:49:27,847
THESE ARE TWO GREAT TEAMS.

1034
00:49:27,849 --> 00:49:29,248
AND THERE'S NO DOUBT IT WILL BE

1035
00:49:29,250 --> 00:49:29,882
BACK AND FORTH ALL NIGHT.

1036
00:49:29,884 --> 00:49:32,284
>> 100%.

1037
00:49:32,286 --> 00:49:34,553
I PREDICT THAT THE PATRIOTS WILL

1038
00:49:34,555 --> 00:49:36,756
BE ON TOP FOR THE FIRST HALF.

1039
00:49:36,758 --> 00:49:39,859
THEN AT SOME POINT, THE SEAHAWKS

1040
00:49:39,861 --> 00:49:40,559
WILL COME FROM BEHIND AND --

1041
00:49:44,966 --> 00:49:45,631
DOMINATE THE PATRIOTS FOR A

1042
00:49:45,633 --> 00:49:48,567
LITTLE WHILE.

1043
00:49:48,569 --> 00:49:50,002
>> YEAH.

1044
00:49:50,004 --> 00:49:52,605
THEN MAYBE THE PATRIOTS GET

1045
00:49:52,607 --> 00:49:54,373
TIRED AND ASK THE SEAHAWKS TO

1046
00:49:54,375 --> 00:49:55,074
PLAY THEMSELVES FOR A LITTLE

1047
00:49:55,076 --> 00:49:55,374
WHILE.

1048
00:50:01,649 --> 00:50:02,581
OR THE PATRIOTS GO WATCH ON THE

1049
00:50:02,583 --> 00:50:02,948
SIDELINES.

1050
00:50:04,585 --> 00:50:05,251
>> OKAY, WHAT ARE YOU GUYS

1051
00:50:05,253 --> 00:50:05,684
TALKING ABOUT?

1052
00:50:08,356 --> 00:50:09,588
>> WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE SUPER

1053
00:50:09,590 --> 00:50:10,556
BOWL, COLIN.

1054
00:50:10,558 --> 00:50:11,924
IT'S THE BIGGEST GAME OF THE

1055
00:50:11,926 --> 00:50:12,224
YEAR.

1056
00:50:12,226 --> 00:50:13,292
SO YOU KNOW, WHATEVER HAPPENS,

1057
00:50:13,294 --> 00:50:14,026
ALL I KNOW IS -- SOMEONE'S

1058
00:50:14,028 --> 00:50:21,967
GETTING A RING.

1059
00:50:21,969 --> 00:50:23,536
>> YOU THINK THAT SOMEONE WILL

1060
00:50:23,538 --> 00:50:23,936
GET A RING?

1061
00:50:23,938 --> 00:50:26,972
>> OH, WOW.

1062
00:50:26,974 --> 00:50:27,673
WELL, PROBABLY NOT LIKE THAT

1063
00:50:27,675 --> 00:50:29,542
NIGHT.

1064
00:50:29,544 --> 00:50:32,011
>> I DIDN'T SAY THAT NIGHT.

1065
00:50:32,013 --> 00:50:33,579
>> LOOK, I THINK THE PATRIOTS

1066
00:50:33,581 --> 00:50:34,280
JUST THOUGHT THIS WAS, LIKE,

1067
00:50:34,282 --> 00:50:34,580
CHILL.

1068
00:50:36,150 --> 00:50:37,550
>> OH, OH, OKAY.

1069
00:50:37,552 --> 00:50:38,818
OH, THE PATRIOTS THOUGHT IT WAS

1070
00:50:38,820 --> 00:50:39,552
SUPER CHILL.

1071
00:50:39,554 --> 00:50:41,187
THEY THOUGHT THE SUPER BOWL WAS

1072
00:50:41,189 --> 00:50:44,056
CHILL, OKAY.

1073
00:50:44,058 --> 00:50:44,356
WELL.

1074
00:50:44,358 --> 00:50:46,826
I THINK IF THE SEAHAWKS KNEW

1075
00:50:46,828 --> 00:50:48,527
THAT, THEY WOULDN'T HAVE DONE

1076
00:50:48,529 --> 00:50:49,995
THE TUSH PUSH IN COLIN'S

1077
00:50:49,997 --> 00:50:50,463
DRESSING ROOM.

1078
00:50:50,465 --> 00:50:52,364
>> MY DRESSING ROOM AGAIN?

1079
00:50:52,366 --> 00:50:53,933
>> THE TUSH PUSH?

1080
00:50:53,935 --> 00:50:55,935
IF I RECALL, THE SEAHAWKS CALLED

1081
00:50:55,937 --> 00:50:56,435
THAT PLAY.

1082
00:50:56,437 --> 00:50:57,870
THE PATRIOTS WERE ACTUALLY

1083
00:50:57,872 --> 00:50:59,205
SCARED TO DO IT BECAUSE THEY'D

1084
00:50:59,207 --> 00:50:59,839
ONLY EVER SEEN IT ON FILM.

1085
00:51:01,709 --> 00:51:03,576
>> THE SECOND THE SEAHAWKS

1086
00:51:03,578 --> 00:51:04,310
MUTTERED TUSH PUSH, THE PATRIOTS

1087
00:51:04,312 --> 00:51:04,677
SCORED --

1088
00:51:04,679 --> 00:51:07,413
>> OKAY.

1089
00:51:07,415 --> 00:51:07,813
OH, MY GOSH.

1090
00:51:07,815 --> 00:51:08,514
TWO PEOPLE WHO JUST HOOKED UP.

1091
00:51:12,453 --> 00:51:14,820
FOR "WEEKEND UPDATE," I'M COLIN

1092
00:51:14,822 --> 00:51:15,121
JOST.

1093
00:51:15,123 --> 00:51:17,556
>> I'M MICHAEL CHE, GOOD NIGHT!

1094
00:51:44,251 --> 00:51:48,687
>> THANK YOU GIRLS FOR COMING

1095
00:51:48,689 --> 00:51:50,189
OVER TO HANG WITH AGNES.

1096
00:51:50,191 --> 00:51:51,590
SHE HASN'T REALLY HAD A CHANCE

1097
00:51:51,592 --> 00:51:53,626
TO MEET ANY OTHER KIDS SINCE WE

1098
00:51:53,628 --> 00:51:54,793
MOVED HERE FROM IOWA.

1099
00:51:54,795 --> 00:51:55,594
RIGHT, AGNES?

1100
00:51:55,596 --> 00:51:58,197
DON'T BE SHY, COME ON.

1101
00:51:58,199 --> 00:51:58,664
>> STOP IT, MOM.

1102
00:52:02,203 --> 00:52:02,902
YOU'RE EMBARRASSING ME, MOM.

1103
00:52:02,904 --> 00:52:05,437
>> COME ON, SIT.

1104
00:52:05,439 --> 00:52:05,804
BE NICE.

1105
00:52:05,806 --> 00:52:08,274
>> HI, GUYS.

1106
00:52:08,276 --> 00:52:09,341
>> HI, AGNES.

1107
00:52:09,343 --> 00:52:09,775
>> I'M AGNES.

1108
00:52:09,777 --> 00:52:12,044
>> HI, AGNES.

1109
00:52:12,046 --> 00:52:13,345
>> OH, OKAY.

1110
00:52:13,347 --> 00:52:14,547
WELL, I'M GOING TO GET OUT OF

1111
00:52:14,549 --> 00:52:15,080
YOUR HAIR.

1112
00:52:15,082 --> 00:52:17,750
YOU GIRLS HAVE FUN.

1113
00:52:17,752 --> 00:52:18,717
CALL ME IF YOU NEED ME, I'LL BE

1114
00:52:18,719 --> 00:52:20,052
DRINKING IN THE KITCHEN.

1115
00:52:20,054 --> 00:52:20,586
>> THANKS.

1116
00:52:20,588 --> 00:52:21,587
>> BYE, MOM.

1117
00:52:21,589 --> 00:52:23,222
>> AGNES, WHAT DID YOU DO BACK

1118
00:52:23,224 --> 00:52:24,723
IN IOWA FOR FUN?

1119
00:52:24,725 --> 00:52:26,158
>> I DON'T KNOW.

1120
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:27,593
LIKE, USUAL STUFF.

1121
00:52:27,595 --> 00:52:28,928
LIKE, YOU KNOW, PLAY.

1122
00:52:28,930 --> 00:52:30,062
WATCH CARTOONS.

1123
00:52:30,064 --> 00:52:32,431
HOW ABOUT YOU GUYS?

1124
00:52:32,433 --> 00:52:33,065
>> I LOVE CARTOONS.

1125
00:52:33,067 --> 00:52:34,066
HAVE YOU SEEN BLUEY?

1126
00:52:34,068 --> 00:52:34,733
>> NO.

1127
00:52:34,735 --> 00:52:37,303
>> YOU DON'T WATCH BLUEY?

1128
00:52:37,305 --> 00:52:38,704
>> NO, I'VE NEVER SEEN IT.

1129
00:52:38,706 --> 00:52:40,005
>> NOT EVEN ONCE?

1130
00:52:40,007 --> 00:52:42,441
>> I DON'T THINK SO, NO.

1131
00:52:42,443 --> 00:52:44,176
>> YOU'VE NEVER SEEN BLUEY?

1132
00:52:44,178 --> 00:52:45,811
LIKE, HOW IS THAT EVEN POSSIBLE?

1133
00:52:45,813 --> 00:52:46,445
>> I SAID I NEVER SAW IT!

1134
00:52:48,182 --> 00:52:50,916
WHO CARES!

1135
00:52:50,918 --> 00:52:51,317
>> OH, OKAY.

1136
00:52:51,319 --> 00:52:53,652
NO WORRIES.

1137
00:52:53,654 --> 00:52:54,920
>> SORRY ABOUT THAT.

1138
00:52:54,922 --> 00:52:56,889
TOTAL OOPS ON MY PART.

1139
00:52:56,891 --> 00:52:57,223
SORRY.

1140
00:52:57,225 --> 00:52:58,757
>> THAT'S OKAY.

1141
00:52:58,759 --> 00:53:00,226
ANYWAY, BLUEY IS REALLY COOL.
