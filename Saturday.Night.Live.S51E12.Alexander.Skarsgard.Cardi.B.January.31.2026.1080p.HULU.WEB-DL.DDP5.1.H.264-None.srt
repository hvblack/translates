1
00:00:00,436 --> 00:00:03,574
>>> IN RESPONSE TO THE CHAOTIC
SITUATION IN MINNESOTA,

2
00:00:03,574 --> 00:00:06,287
PRESIDENT TRUMP ORDERED WHITE
HOUSE BORDER CZAR TOM HOMAN

3
00:00:06,287 --> 00:00:09,011
TO
TRAVEL TO MINNEAPOLIS AND TAKE
CONTROL OF THE OPERATION.

4
00:00:09,011 --> 00:00:11,315
UPON ARRIVAL, HE MET WITH I.C.E.
UNIT COMMANDERS

5
00:00:11,315 --> 00:00:13,719
TO CLARIFY THE
MISSION OBJECTIVES.

6
00:00:13,719 --> 00:00:16,655
>> ALL RIGHT, EVERYONE.

7
00:00:16,655 --> 00:00:21,257
ALL RIGHT.
THANK YOU.
ALL RIGHT.

8
00:00:21,257 --> 00:00:23,665
ALL RIGHT, EVERYONE, SETTLE
DOWN.

9
00:00:23,665 --> 00:00:25,121
MY NAME IS TOM HOMAN.

10
00:00:25,121 --> 00:00:29,742
NOW I'M SURE A LOT OF YOU ARE
WONDERING WHY GREG BOVINO, THE
LAST GUY, WAS DISMISSED.

11
00:00:29,742 --> 00:00:33,166
I WANT TO STRESS THAT IT WASN'T
BECAUSE HE DID A BAD JOB.

12
00:00:33,166 --> 00:00:36,209
OR PUBLICLY LIED ABOUT THE
SHOOTING OF AN AMERICAN CITIZEN.

13
00:00:36,309 --> 00:00:39,653
OR EVEN, OH-OH, DRESSED LIKE A
NAZI.

14
00:00:39,653 --> 00:00:44,270
IT WAS THAT HE WAS FILMED DOING
THESE THINGS.

15
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:46,762
AND THE PRESIDENT NO LIKEE THAT.

16
00:00:46,762 --> 00:00:49,407
SO I'M HERE NOW, AND WE NEED TO
TIGHTEN UP.

17
00:00:49,407 --> 00:00:51,928
THAT STARTS WITH REMEMBERING THE
MISSION OBJECTIVE.

18
00:00:52,013 --> 00:00:55,338
NOW, WHO CAN TELL ME WHY WE'RE
HERE IN MINNEAPOLIS?

19
00:00:55,338 --> 00:00:57,025
>> PASS.

20
00:00:57,025 --> 00:00:59,679
>> NOPE, CAN'T PASS.

21
00:00:59,751 --> 00:01:02,098
COME ON, GUYS.
WHAT ARE WE DOING IN
MINNEAPOLIS?

22
00:01:02,098 --> 00:01:05,722
>> THIS COULD BE WRONG, BUT
ARMY?

23
00:01:05,722 --> 00:01:08,248
>> CLOSE.
THAT'S CLOSE.

24
00:01:08,248 --> 00:01:12,856
WE'RE HERE TO DETAIN AND DEPORT
ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS WHO HAVE
COMMITTED CRIMES.

25
00:01:12,856 --> 00:01:16,621
>> THAT IS LITERALLY THE FIRST
I'M HEARING OF THAT.

26
00:01:16,621 --> 00:01:18,705
>> WELL, IT SHOULDN'T BE.

27
00:01:18,705 --> 00:01:22,048
JUST SO I KNOW WHAT WERE YOU
TOLD YOU SHOULD BE DOING?

28
00:01:22,048 --> 00:01:24,811
>> UM -- WILDING OUT.

29
00:01:24,811 --> 00:01:27,991
>> FORGET EVERYTHING YOU WERE
TOLD BEFORE.

30
00:01:27,991 --> 00:01:32,513
WE'RE NOT HERE TO INTIMIDATE,
RACIALLY PROFILE, OR VIOLATE
ANYONE'S RIGHTS.

31
00:01:32,513 --> 00:01:35,297
SO AGAIN, WHAT ARE WE LOOKING
FOR?

32
00:01:35,297 --> 00:01:37,417
>> EPSTEIN FILES?

33
00:01:37,417 --> 00:01:39,619
>> NOPE!
NOPE!

34
00:01:39,619 --> 00:01:43,087
WE ACTUALLY JUST RELEASED THOSE
TO DISTRACT FROM THIS.

35
00:01:43,087 --> 00:01:46,997
WHICH IS IRONIC, BECAUSE WE DID
THIS TO DISTRACT FROM THOSE, SO...

36
00:01:46,997 --> 00:01:50,671
ANYWAY, GUYS.
IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT DOING THE MISSION,

37
00:01:50,671 --> 00:01:52,467
IT'S ABOUT DOING IT THE
RIGHT WAY.

38
00:01:52,467 --> 00:01:57,179
A LOT OF THE BAD PRESS WE'RE
GETTING IS COMING FROM THE
AGGRESSIVE TACTICS WE'RE USING.

39
00:01:57,179 --> 00:01:59,128
>> AND THE NAZI COAT.

40
00:01:59,128 --> 00:02:02,724
>> YES, THE NAZI COAT, VERY
GOOD.

41
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:08,538
SO, LET'S TALK ABOUT USE OF
FORCE.

42
00:02:08,538 --> 00:02:10,364
WHEN DO WE WANT TO USE FORCE?

43
00:02:10,364 --> 00:02:12,061
>> RIGHT AWAY?

44
00:02:12,061 --> 00:02:15,021
>> NO.
THINK OF THE OPPOSITE.

45
00:02:15,021 --> 00:02:17,678
>> RIGHT.
PRE-EMPTIVELY.

46
00:02:17,678 --> 00:02:21,323
>> ALSO NO.
IT'S KIND OF A TRICK QUESTION,

47
00:02:21,323 --> 00:02:23,740
BECAUSE WE ACTUALLY DON'T WANT
TO USE FORCE.

48
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:28,844
REMEMBER, THE JOB ULTIMATELY IS
ABOUT KEEPING AMERICA SAFE
FROM -- WHAT?

49
00:02:28,844 --> 00:02:32,406
>> THIS COULD BE WRONG, BUT --
DON LEMON?

50
00:02:32,406 --> 00:02:35,665
>> THAT IS WRONG, YES.

51
00:02:35,665 --> 00:02:37,480
IT'S CRIMINALS.

52
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:39,418
>> TEACHER?

53
00:02:39,418 --> 00:02:42,642
>> NOT A TEACHER.
GO AHEAD.

54
00:02:42,642 --> 00:02:46,537
>> UM -- SOME OF THESE PEOPLE
PROTESTING HAVE GUNS.

55
00:02:46,537 --> 00:02:48,914
THAT SHOULDN'T BE ALLOWED,
RIGHT?

56
00:02:48,914 --> 00:02:51,046
>> WELL, LET'S FLIP IT AROUND,
RIGHT?

57
00:02:51,046 --> 00:02:54,080
HOW MANY OF YOU WENT TO A "STOP
THE STEAL" PROTEST

58
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,926
WITH A LOADED
AUTOMATIC WEAPON?

59
00:02:59,243 --> 00:03:01,706
OKAY.
THAT IS ALL OF YOU.

60
00:03:01,706 --> 00:03:02,991
SO YOU'VE GOT TO DO BETTER.

61
00:03:02,991 --> 00:03:05,674
LOOK, I'M TOM HOMAN, OKAY?

62
00:03:05,674 --> 00:03:10,681
I'M THE -- I'M THE SEPARATING
FAMILIES AT THE BORDER GUY.

63
00:03:10,681 --> 00:03:14,747
I'M THE ON-FILM TAKING A $50,000
BRIBE GUY.

64
00:03:14,747 --> 00:03:19,233
AND Y'ALL ARE MAKING ME LOOK
LIKE THE UPSTANDING, REASONABLE
ADULT IN THE ROOM.
THAT'S CRAZY!

65
00:03:19,233 --> 00:03:21,994
NOW, LET'S OPEN IT UP TO
QUESTIONS, PLEASE.
YES?

66
00:03:22,096 --> 00:03:24,639
>> I HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT THE
LOCAL POLICE.

67
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:29,026
>> THAT'S GREAT.
I WAS HOPING SOMEONE WOULD BRING
THIS UP, BECAUSE THERE'S BEEN
SOME FRICTION THERE.

68
00:03:29,026 --> 00:03:31,295
WHAT'S YOUR QUESTION ABOUT THE
LOCAL POLICE?

69
00:03:31,295 --> 00:03:35,636
>> UM -- HOW COME I WASN'T
ALLOWED TO BE IN THEM?

70
00:03:35,636 --> 00:03:38,322
>> I'M NOT SURE.

71
00:03:38,322 --> 00:03:39,934
YES, YES, YOU.

72
00:03:39,934 --> 00:03:43,588
>> UH, YES.
SO -- I HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT
DESTROYING EVIDENCE.

73
00:03:43,588 --> 00:03:45,228
>> YEAH, LET ME STOP YOU RIGHT
THERE.

74
00:03:45,228 --> 00:03:48,518
YOU SHOULD NEVER, NEVER DESTROY
EVIDENCE.

75
00:03:48,518 --> 00:03:50,833
>> GOT IT.

76
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:55,310
>> DON'T WINK.
DON'T WINK.

77
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:58,425
NOW, WHO ELSE HAS A QUESTION?
YES, YOU?

78
00:03:58,425 --> 00:04:02,224
>> YEAH, HOW COME ALL THE FAST
FOOD IN THIS CITY TASTES LIKE
SPIT?

79
00:04:02,224 --> 00:04:05,150
>> IT'S JUST BEST NOT TO THINK
ABOUT THAT.

80
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:07,801
OKAY.
WE GOT ONE MORE QUESTION.

81
00:04:07,801 --> 00:04:10,953
>> I'M BEING DETAILED TO THE
SUPER BOWL,

82
00:04:10,953 --> 00:04:14,293
BUT I'M LOOKING IN
MY TICKET APP AND I DON'T SEE A
TICKET.

83
00:04:14,293 --> 00:04:18,092
>> RIGHT.
SO YOU WON'T ACTUALLY HAVE A
SEAT.

84
00:04:18,092 --> 00:04:22,922
>> SO WE'RE PLAYING IN IT?
LIKE WHAT?

85
00:04:22,922 --> 00:04:25,459
>> GUYS.
GUYS, NO.
NO.

86
00:04:25,459 --> 00:04:29,325
LET'S RECAP.
WHAT HAVE WE LEARNED TODAY?

87
00:04:29,325 --> 00:04:31,374
>> THIS COULD BE WRONG, BUT --

88
00:04:31,374 --> 00:04:34,128
THAT YOU HIRED A BUNCH OF ANGRY,
AGGRESSIVE GUYS,

89
00:04:34,128 --> 00:04:38,058
GAVE US GUNS,
DIDN'T TRAIN US, SO THIS IS WHAT
YOU WANTED TO HAPPEN?

90
00:04:38,058 --> 00:04:42,010
>> COME ON, MAN, DON'T START
THINKING NOW.

91
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:44,841
DROP AND GIVE ME 20.

92
00:04:44,841 --> 00:04:48,701
>> HOW ABOUT THREE WITH KNEES
GIRL-STYLE?

93
00:04:48,701 --> 00:04:50,669
>> NEVER MIND.
LOOK.

94
00:04:50,669 --> 00:04:55,113
THE SITUATION OUT THERE HAS BEEN
ROUGH, AND WE NEED TO LOWER THE
TEMPERATURE.

95
00:04:55,113 --> 00:04:58,354
SO LET'S GET OUT THERE, LET'S
SHOW SOME RESTRAINT.

96
00:04:58,354 --> 00:05:02,485
LET'S DO OUR JOB WITHOUT
VIOLATING ANYONE'S RIGHTS AS
AMERICANS.

97
00:05:02,485 --> 00:05:05,455
CAN YOU DO THAT?
>> NO.

98
00:05:05,455 --> 00:05:08,949
>> WELL, I HAD TO ASK.
MAYBE JUST TRY NOT TO GET
FILMED.

99
00:05:08,949 --> 00:05:13,414
AND LIVE FROM NEW YORK, IT'S
SATURDAY NIGHT!

100
00:07:11,442 --> 00:07:16,085
MUSICAL

101

HOST
SKARSGARD!

102
00:07:23,242 --> 00:07:28,855
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN --
ALEXANDER SKARSGARD!

103
00:07:47,971 --> 00:07:50,581
>> THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK

104
00:07:50,581 --> 00:07:53,461
I AM INCREDIBLY EXCITED TO BE
HERE TONIGHT,

105
00:07:53,461 --> 00:07:59,275
BECAUSE WE ARE
CELEBRATING 1,000 EPISODES OF
SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE!

106
00:08:01,993 --> 00:08:06,719
¶ CELEBRATE GOOD TIMES COME ON ¶

107
00:08:10,456 --> 00:08:13,315
NOW, WHEN I WAS A KID, I LOVED
WATCHING THIS SHOW

108
00:08:13,315 --> 00:08:15,940
FROM MY IGLOO
BACK IN STOCKHOLM.

109
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:19,440
BUT DURING THESE MONOLOGUES, I
WOULD NEVER FOCUS ON THE HOST.

110
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:22,309
I WAS MORE INTERESTED IN THE
BAND.

111
00:08:22,309 --> 00:08:24,067
BACK THERE IN THE BACKGROUND.

112
00:08:24,067 --> 00:08:26,933
SOMETIMES LAUGHING.
MORE OFTEN NOT.

113
00:08:26,933 --> 00:08:31,443
BUT ALWAYS OUT OF FOCUS.
NEVER IN THE SPOTLIGHT.

114
00:08:31,443 --> 00:08:33,485
WELL, NOT ON MY WATCH.

115
00:08:33,485 --> 00:08:36,432
CALL ME WILLY WONKA, BECAUSE
TONIGHT,

116
00:08:36,432 --> 00:08:39,293
I'M GOING TO LET THE
LITTLE PEOPLE COOK.

117
00:08:40,433 --> 00:08:43,245
GUYS, GIVE ME SOMETHING.

118
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,620
SEE, I LIKE THAT ONE.

119
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:48,959
NICE RIGHT THERE.
MIC, PLEASE.

120
00:08:49,608 --> 00:08:51,838
COME

121
00:08:54,612 --> 00:08:57,249
WHAT IS YOUR NAME, GOOD SIR?
>> JAMES.

122
00:08:57,249 --> 00:08:59,603
>> BEAUTIFUL NAME.
HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN IN THE
BAND?

123
00:08:59,603 --> 00:09:03,955
>> 26 YEARS, BUT
>> THAT'S AMAZING, AMAZING.

124
00:09:03,955 --> 00:09:08,544
HOW ABOUT YOU, IS SIR?
MUST BE PRETTY COOL TO TALK TO
THE HOST, HUH?

125
00:09:08,544 --> 00:09:11,743
>> DEPENDS ON THE HOST.
>> YOU ARE WELCOME.

126
00:09:12,291 --> 00:09:17,814
A FEMALE.
ON GUITAR.

127
00:09:18,658 --> 00:09:23,848
YBANEZ 2000, NO?
>> NO.

128
00:09:23,848 --> 00:09:25,387
>> NO?
THAT'S WHAT I SAID NO.

129
00:09:25,491 --> 00:09:27,634
GREAT BANTER, GUYS.

130
00:09:28,307 --> 00:09:34,207
HEY -- WHO WANTS TO HEAR SOME
FREEFORM JAZZ?

131
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:37,534
THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT.
SHOW ME WHAT YOU GOT.

132
00:09:39,776 --> 00:09:44,317
 WHAT HAVE WE GOT HERE?
A LITTLE STRAY SAXOPHONE.

133
00:09:44,317 --> 00:09:47,401
ALWAYS WANTED TO PLAY ONE OF
THOSE.

134
00:09:54,031 --> 00:09:57,949
THAT WAS EASY.
NO, NO, DON'T FOLLOW ME.

135
00:09:57,949 --> 00:10:01,781
FOCUS ON THE LADIES.

136
00:10:10,344 --> 00:10:12,927
POWER

137
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:17,493
YOU

138
00:10:49,924 --> 00:10:53,308
IT FEELS GOOD TO GIVE!

139
00:10:53,308 --> 00:10:56,581
GIVE IT UP FOR THE BAND FOR
REALS.

140
00:10:59,297 --> 00:11:03,349
WE HAVE A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU.
CARDI B IS HERE.

141
00:11:04,027 --> 00:11:06,901
STICK AROUND, WE'LL BE RIGHT
BACK!

142
00:11:36,388 --> 00:11:40,438
THANKS
MOM AND DAD.

143
00:11:40,438 --> 00:11:42,083
>> OF COURSE.

144
00:11:42,083 --> 00:11:44,584
>> WE LOVE YOU, WE LOVE YOU.

145
00:11:44,584 --> 00:11:48,610
>> SHOULD WE HEAD TO THE
RESTAURANT?
I'M STARVING.

146
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:49,965
>> OH, YEAH.
>> SURE.

147
00:11:50,047 --> 00:11:53,513
>> OH, OH -- WAIT.
WAIT, THERE'S -- 

148
00:11:53,623 --> 00:11:56,552
THERE'S
SOMETHING I NEED TO TELL YOU ALL
FIRST.

149
00:11:56,552 --> 00:11:59,973
>> OH, OKAY, WHAT IS IT, MOM?
>> IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

150
00:11:59,973 --> 00:12:04,310
>> I'M ONLY GOING TO SAY IT IF,
AFTER I DO,

151
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:07,862

NO TALKING.
NO FACES.

153
00:12:12,011 --> 00:12:14,265
NO NOTHING.

154
00:12:14,265 --> 00:12:18,596
>> MOM, WHAT IS GOING ON?

00:12:23,968 --> 00:12:27,300
AND IT'S GOING TO MAKE YOU WANT
TO REACT.

157
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:31,492
BUT I NEED YOU TO PROMISE THAT

00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:43,528
I EAT BUGS.

163
00:12:49,069 --> 00:12:49,400
>> MOM.

164
00:12:49,402 --> 00:12:49,801

165
00:12:49,803 --> 00:12:51,302

NO NOTHING.

170
00:12:58,979 --> 00:12:59,911
MY BUTT FELL OFF, I CAN'T FIND

171
00:12:59,913 --> 00:13:00,178
IT.

172
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:04,182
I DON'T HAVE A BUTT.

173
00:13:04,184 --> 00:13:07,619
OKAY, GOOD.

174
00:13:07,621 --> 00:13:11,923
WHAT I HAVE TO TELL YOU -- IS I

175
00:13:11,925 --> 00:13:16,728
MAY HAVE CHANGED MY MIND --

176

00:13:28,909 --> 00:13:29,240
>> YES!

182
00:13:29,242 --> 00:13:34,279

BE -- BAD FOR OUR COUNTRY.

185
00:13:44,758 --> 00:13:45,190
>> OH, I DO!

186
00:13:45,192 --> 00:13:47,625

>> I'M SORRY, MOM, YOU'VE GOT TO

189
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:53,932
BE JOKING.

190
00:13:53,934 --> 00:13:55,567
>> WE'VE BEEN SAYING THIS SINCE

191
00:13:55,569 --> 00:13:55,867

192
00:13:55,869 --> 00:13:57,835
>> OH, I'M SORRY I'M LATE TO THE

193
00:13:57,837 --> 00:13:58,269
PERFECT PARTY.

194

DO YOU GUYS WANT THIS TO BE REAL

195
00:14:00,106 --> 00:14:00,738

200
00:14:10,684 --> 00:14:16,688
I FEEL LIKE -- MAYBE -- SOME OF

201
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:19,691
THE THINGS HE SAYS -- AREN'T

202
00:14:19,693 --> 00:14:20,992
TRUE.

203
00:14:20,994 --> 00:14:22,994

>> GUYS, COME ON, CAN'T YOU SEE

209
00:14:32,138 --> 00:14:35,006
THIS IS HARD FOR YOUR MOTHER?

00:14:35,008 --> 00:14:37,609
ALSO, I WANT TO REMIND

211

AND FOR THE RECORD, YOU LITTLE

215
00:14:45,852 --> 00:14:47,352
BRATS, I DO STILL THINK HE'S A

216
00:14:47,354 --> 00:14:48,620
GOOD BUSINESSMAN.

217
00:14:48,622 --> 00:14:50,355
>> MOM, COME ON.

218
00:14:50,357 --> 00:14:52,523
>> THIS IS WHY NOBODY LIKES YOUR

219
00:14:52,525 --> 00:14:52,824
SIDE!

220
00:14:52,826 --> 00:14:53,591
YOU THINK YOU KNOW EVERYTHING

221
00:14:53,593 --> 00:14:55,893
WITH YOUR MACHO RAPPING HAMILTON

222
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:56,594
AND YOUR IUDs.

223
00:14:56,596 --> 00:14:59,063
JUST HAVE KIDS ALREADY!

224
00:14:59,065 --> 00:15:02,066
>> WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

225
00:15:02,068 --> 00:15:03,268
>> MAYBE WE COULD TALK ABOUT

226
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:03,801
THIS AT RED ROBIN'S.

227
00:15:06,539 --> 00:15:07,739
I'M AFRAID THEY'RE GOING TO GIVE

228
00:15:07,741 --> 00:15:09,874
OUR TABLE AWAY, AND I WANT MY

229
00:15:09,876 --> 00:15:10,675
BIRTHDAY SCOOP.

230
00:15:10,677 --> 00:15:12,543
>> OKAY, MOM, WE'RE SORRY, WE'LL

231
00:15:12,545 --> 00:15:13,311
BE QUIET.

232
00:15:13,313 --> 00:15:14,045
JUST SAY WHAT YOU NEED TO SAY.

233
00:15:14,047 --> 00:15:16,214
>> FINE.

234
00:15:16,216 --> 00:15:19,550
BUT I SWEAR TO GOD --

235
00:15:19,953 --> 00:15:22,687
IF I HEAR A SINGLE "I TOLD YOU

236
00:15:22,689 --> 00:15:25,123
SO," I WILL GO SEE THE "MELANIA"

237
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:26,291
MOVIE TONIGHT.

238
00:15:26,693 --> 00:15:27,725
YOU HEAR ME?

239
00:15:27,727 --> 00:15:28,092
>> OKAY.

240
00:15:28,094 --> 00:15:30,428
>> I HEAR YOU.

241
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:35,500
>> THEN I WILL SPEAK.

242
00:15:35,502 --> 00:15:39,771
THE THINGS THAT ARE HAPPENING --

243
00:15:39,773 --> 00:15:40,471
NO ONE COULD HAVE SEEN COMING.

244
00:15:48,014 --> 00:15:50,315
I FEEL LIKE -- THE WAY THEY TALK

245
00:15:50,317 --> 00:15:56,087
ABOUT GUNS -- IS DIFFERENT --

246
00:15:56,089 --> 00:15:56,654
FOR DIFFERENT PEOPLE.

247
00:16:03,797 --> 00:16:06,364
THEY MADE ME FEEL WORRIED --

248
00:16:06,366 --> 00:16:08,399
ABOUT TRANS PEOPLE.

249
00:16:08,401 --> 00:16:12,370
BUT NOW I'M REALIZING -- I DON'T

250
00:16:12,372 --> 00:16:13,104
REALLY GET WHAT THE PROBLEM IS.

251
00:16:19,879 --> 00:16:22,447
I'M STARTING TO WONDER -- IF

252
00:16:22,449 --> 00:16:25,383
DRAG QUEENS -- ARE ACTUALLY

253
00:16:25,385 --> 00:16:25,750
HILARIOUS.

254
00:16:30,824 --> 00:16:32,523
OH, STOP THAT, I SEE WHAT YOU'RE

255
00:16:32,525 --> 00:16:32,824
DOING!

256
00:16:32,826 --> 00:16:33,424
STOP IT!

257
00:16:33,426 --> 00:16:36,094
>> ENOUGH, ENOUGH, LEAVE YOUR

258
00:16:36,096 --> 00:16:36,527
MOTHER ALONE.

259
00:16:36,529 --> 00:16:38,696
HER LAPTOP IS OLD, SHE GETS A

260
00:16:38,698 --> 00:16:40,298
DIFFERENT INTERNET THAN YOU.

261
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:41,399
>> NOT HOW THAT WORKS.

262
00:16:41,401 --> 00:16:42,967
>> THAT IS HOW THAT WORKS, AND

263
00:16:42,969 --> 00:16:44,802
THIS IS VULNERABLE FOR ME, OKAY?

264
00:16:44,804 --> 00:16:45,436
YOU SHOULD UNDERSTAND.

265
00:16:45,438 --> 00:16:47,138
WHAT DID I SAY WHEN YOU CAME

266
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:47,405

267
00:16:47,407 --> 00:16:48,806

OR SHE WON'T DANCE FOR ME

274
00:16:59,152 --> 00:16:59,484
TONIGHT.

275
00:16:59,486 --> 00:17:01,786

00:23:35,681 --> 00:23:37,748
WE ARE HERE.

494
00:23:44,624 --> 00:23:48,125
>> HELLO, MY CHILDREN.

495
00:23:48,127 --> 00:23:51,362
I WANT TO APOLOGIZE TO YOU.

496
00:23:51,364 --> 00:23:54,165
I'VE BECOME A STONE AROUND YOUR

497
00:23:54,167 --> 00:23:54,465
NECK.

498
00:23:54,467 --> 00:23:55,432
>> FATHER, DON'T SAY THIS.

499
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:57,201
>> ALL THESE YEARS, YOU'VE HATED

500
00:23:57,203 --> 00:23:58,102
ME FOR FLINGING YOUR MOTHER OFF

501
00:23:58,104 --> 00:24:01,939
THE DOCK.

502
00:24:01,941 --> 00:24:02,873
BUT THE TRUTH IS, SHE FLUNG

503
00:24:02,875 --> 00:24:05,810
HERSELF.

504
00:24:05,812 --> 00:24:07,745
I WANTED TO PROTECT YOU FROM THE

505
00:24:07,747 --> 00:24:08,045
TRUTH.

506
00:24:08,047 --> 00:24:10,381
>> WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

507
00:24:10,383 --> 00:24:11,949
>> IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.

508
00:24:11,951 --> 00:24:12,583
SHE JUST DIDN'T LIKE YOU.

509
00:24:17,156 --> 00:24:18,155
BUT NOW IT'S TIME TO DROWN

510
00:24:18,157 --> 00:24:21,158
MYSELF IN THIS TUB.

511
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:23,694
SO I WILL NO LONGER HAVE TO

512
00:24:23,696 --> 00:24:26,697
SMELL THE STENCH OF A FAMILY.

513
00:24:26,699 --> 00:24:28,098
>> OH!

514
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:29,033
>> OH!

515
00:24:29,035 --> 00:24:33,070
>> MY ONLY ASK IS, HOLD MY HAND.

516
00:24:33,072 --> 00:24:34,471
AS I GO DOWN IN THE WATER.

517
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:42,112
>> OF COURSE, FATHER.

518
00:24:42,114 --> 00:24:42,813
>> FETCH!

519
00:24:42,815 --> 00:24:44,315
>> ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

520
00:24:44,317 --> 00:24:47,017
>> WAY TO GO!

521
00:24:47,019 --> 00:24:47,551
>> THAT'S A BLOOPER!

522
00:24:47,553 --> 00:24:50,988
>> BLOOD PRESSURER!

523
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:51,322

VERY INTENT.

594
00:27:48,334 --> 00:27:50,434
THEN ONE DAY, FINALLY, WE DIE.

595
00:27:52,605 --> 00:27:55,406

RECENTLY, ME AND MY WIFE GOT

608
00:28:19,832 --> 00:28:21,932
INTO A LITTLE TIFF BECAUSE SHE

609
00:28:21,934 --> 00:28:23,801
THINKS I'M TOO AFFECTIONATE WITH

610
00:28:23,803 --> 00:28:25,069
OUR SON.

611
00:28:25,071 --> 00:28:25,636
BUT THAT IS NOT TRUE.

612
00:28:25,638 --> 00:28:30,240
RIGHT, CONNER?

613
00:28:30,242 --> 00:28:30,908

00:28:30,910 --> 00:28:32,309
YOU'RE THE BEST DAD EVER.

615
00:28:32,311 --> 00:28:33,043
>> ONLY BECAUSE YOU'RE THE BEST

616
00:28:33,045 --> 00:28:35,679
SON EVER.

617
00:28:35,681 --> 00:28:37,915
>> OH!

618
00:28:37,917 --> 00:28:40,818
NO, NO!

619
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:42,953
NO, NO, NO!

620
00:28:42,955 --> 00:28:43,620
DON'T DO IT HERE!

621
00:28:48,861 --> 00:28:52,096
>> I MEAN, I'M SURE YOUR DADS

622
00:28:52,098 --> 00:28:54,898
SHOWED AFFECTION TO YOU, RIGHT,

623
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:55,199
HEIKE?

624
00:28:55,201 --> 00:28:57,101
>> ONE TIME, ME AND MY FATHER

625
00:28:57,103 --> 00:28:58,869
WERE SITTING IN A SAUNA.

626
00:28:58,871 --> 00:28:59,837
AND OUR KNEECAPS ACCIDENTALLY

627
00:28:59,839 --> 00:29:00,170
TOUCHED.

628
00:29:02,975 --> 00:29:03,974
AND HE SAID, "TELL NO ONE OF

629
00:29:03,976 --> 00:29:04,274
THIS."

630
00:29:12,451 --> 00:29:13,183
>> I TOLD YOU, TELL NO ONE OF

631
00:29:13,185 --> 00:29:13,484
THIS.

632
00:29:16,222 --> 00:29:17,955
>> FORGIVE ME, FATHER.

633
00:29:17,957 --> 00:29:19,490
>> THE SHAME IS YOURS!

634
00:29:19,492 --> 00:29:22,626
LIVE WITH IT!

635
00:29:32,204 --> 00:29:32,769
>> WHITE PEOPLE, VERY

636
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:33,170
INTERESTING.

637

THEY NEVER SCREAM, YOU KNOW?

638
00:29:38,177 --> 00:29:40,611
THEY JUST PUSH IT DOWN, DOWN,

639
00:29:40,613 --> 00:29:40,911
DOWN.

640
00:29:40,913 --> 00:29:42,813
AND THEN ONE DAY, THEY KILL

641
00:29:42,815 --> 00:29:43,380
THEIR WIFE, HA HA HA!

642
00:29:45,951 --> 00:29:48,385
ME AND MY WIFE, WE HAVE A

643
00:29:48,387 --> 00:29:49,953
BEAUTIFUL RELATIONSHIP.

644

BECAUSE I DO WHATEVER I WANT.

645
00:29:52,224 --> 00:29:53,423
BECAUSE IT'S MY HOUSE, AND IT'S

646
00:29:53,425 --> 00:29:53,924

>> WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE?

650
00:30:07,239 --> 00:30:09,640

>> I KNOW, I KNOW.

658
00:30:23,088 --> 00:30:24,354
>> YOU DON'T MUCH ATTENTION.

659
00:30:24,356 --> 00:30:25,789
SMOKING IN MY HOUSE?

660
00:30:25,791 --> 00:30:30,460
HAVING THESE PEOPLE EAT MY FOOD?

661
00:30:30,462 --> 00:30:31,461
SICK OF YOU.

00:49:45,633 --> 00:49:48,567
LITTLE WHILE.

1167
00:49:48,569 --> 00:49:50,002
>> YEAH.

1168
00:49:50,004 --> 00:49:52,605
THEN MAYBE THE PATRIOTS GET

1169
00:49:52,607 --> 00:49:54,373
TIRED AND ASK THE SEAHAWKS TO

1170
00:49:54,375 --> 00:49:55,074
PLAY THEMSELVES FOR A LITTLE

1171
00:49:55,076 --> 00:49:55,374
WHILE.

1172
00:50:01,649 --> 00:50:02,581
OR THE PATRIOTS GO WATCH ON THE

1173
00:50:02,583 --> 00:50:02,948
SIDELINES.

1174
00:50:04,585 --> 00:50:05,251
>> OKAY, WHAT ARE YOU GUYS

1175
00:50:05,253 --> 00:50:05,684
TALKING ABOUT?

1176
00:50:08,356 --> 00:50:09,588
>> WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE SUPER

1177
00:50:09,590 --> 00:50:10,556
BOWL, COLIN.

1178
00:50:10,558 --> 00:50:11,924
IT'S THE BIGGEST GAME OF THE

1179
00:50:11,926 --> 00:50:12,224
YEAR.

1180
00:50:12,226 --> 00:50:13,292
SO YOU KNOW, WHATEVER HAPPENS,

1181
00:50:13,294 --> 00:50:14,026
ALL I KNOW IS -- SOMEONE'S

1182
00:50:14,028 --> 00:50:21,967
GETTING A RING.

1183
00:50:21,969 --> 00:50:23,536
>> YOU THINK THAT SOMEONE WILL

1184
00:50:23,538 --> 00:50:23,936
GET A RING?

1185
00:50:23,938 --> 00:50:26,972
>> OH, WOW.

1186
00:50:26,974 --> 00:50:27,673
WELL, PROBABLY NOT LIKE THAT

1187
00:50:27,675 --> 00:50:29,542
NIGHT.

1188
00:50:29,544 --> 00:50:32,011
>> I DIDN'T SAY THAT NIGHT.

1189
00:50:32,013 --> 00:50:33,579
>> LOOK, I THINK THE PATRIOTS

1190
00:50:33,581 --> 00:50:34,280
JUST THOUGHT THIS WAS, LIKE,

1191
00:50:34,282 --> 00:50:34,580
CHILL.

1192
00:50:36,150 --> 00:50:37,550
>> OH, OH, OKAY.

1193
00:50:37,552 --> 00:50:38,818
OH, THE PATRIOTS THOUGHT IT WAS

1194
00:50:38,820 --> 00:50:39,552
SUPER CHILL.

1195
00:50:39,554 --> 00:50:41,187
THEY THOUGHT THE SUPER BOWL WAS

1196
00:50:41,189 --> 00:50:44,056
CHILL, OKAY.

1197
00:50:44,058 --> 00:50:44,356
WELL.

1198
00:50:44,358 --> 00:50:46,826
I THINK IF THE SEAHAWKS KNEW

1199
00:50:46,828 --> 00:50:48,527
THAT, THEY WOULDN'T HAVE DONE

1200
00:50:48,529 --> 00:50:49,995
THE TUSH PUSH IN COLIN'S

1201
00:50:49,997 --> 00:50:50,463
DRESSING ROOM.

1202
00:50:50,465 --> 00:50:52,364
>> MY DRESSING ROOM AGAIN?

1203
00:50:52,366 --> 00:50:53,933
>> THE TUSH PUSH?

1204
00:50:53,935 --> 00:50:55,935
IF I RECALL, THE SEAHAWKS CALLED

1205
00:50:55,937 --> 00:50:56,435
THAT PLAY.

1206
00:50:56,437 --> 00:50:57,870
THE PATRIOTS WERE ACTUALLY

1207
00:50:57,872 --> 00:50:59,205
SCARED TO DO IT BECAUSE THEY'D

1208
00:50:59,207 --> 00:50:59,839
ONLY EVER SEEN IT ON FILM.

1209
00:51:01,709 --> 00:51:03,576
>> THE SECOND THE SEAHAWKS

1210
00:51:03,578 --> 00:51:04,310
MUTTERED TUSH PUSH, THE PATRIOTS

1211
00:51:04,312 --> 00:51:04,677
SCORED --

1212
00:51:04,679 --> 00:51:07,413
>> OKAY.

1213
00:51:07,415 --> 00:51:07,813
OH, MY GOSH.

1214
00:51:07,815 --> 00:51:08,514
TWO PEOPLE WHO JUST HOOKED UP.

1215
00:51:12,453 --> 00:51:14,820
FOR "WEEKEND UPDATE," I'M COLIN

1216
00:51:14,822 --> 00:51:15,121
JOST.

1217
00:51:15,123 --> 00:51:17,556
>> I'M MICHAEL CHE, GOOD NIGHT!

1218
00:51:44,251 --> 00:51:48,687
>> THANK YOU GIRLS FOR COMING

1219
00:51:48,689 --> 00:51:50,189
OVER TO HANG WITH AGNES.

1220
00:51:50,191 --> 00:51:51,590
SHE HASN'T REALLY HAD A CHANCE

1221
00:51:51,592 --> 00:51:53,626
TO MEET ANY OTHER KIDS SINCE WE

1222
00:51:53,628 --> 00:51:54,793

1223
00:51:54,795 --> 00:51:55,594
RIGHT, AGNES?

1224
00:51:55,596 --> 00:51:58,197
DON'T BE SHY, COME ON.

1225
00:51:58,199 --> 00:51:58,664
>> STOP IT, MOM.

1226
00:52:02,203 --> 00:52:02,902
YOU'RE EMBARRASSING ME, MOM.

1227
00:52:02,904 --> 00:52:05,437
>> COME ON, SIT.

1228
00:52:05,439 --> 00:52:05,804
BE NICE.

1229
00:52:05,806 --> 00:52:08,274
>> HI, GUYS.

00:52:13,347 --> 00:52:14,547
WELL, I'M GOING TO GET OUT OF

DOING IT WRONG, I GUESS.

1332

1676
01:05:48,462 --> 01:05:50,762

WATCHING "MARLEY & ME."

1679
01:05:52,799 --> 01:05:54,299
I REMEMBER BECAUSE I LAUGHED SO

1680
01:05:54,301 --> 01:05:55,433

1681
01:05:55,435 --> 01:05:57,235
>> I DON'T REMEMBER THAT AT ALL.

1682
01:05:57,237 --> 01:06:00,138

1684
01:06:05,946 --> 01:06:06,611

01:06:06,613 --> 01:06:07,479
>> I DON'T RECALL THAT.

1686
01:06:07,481 --> 01:06:09,581

IN RA.

1691
01:06:21,528 --> 01:06:24,429
>> WHO ARE YOU?

1692
01:06:24,431 --> 01:06:25,130
I DON'T KNOW YOU ANYMORE.

ARE YOU EVEN TWISTED?

1694
01:06:27,701 --> 01:06:33,705
>> NO, I'M JUST -- NORMAL!

1695
01:06:33,707 --> 01:06:34,939
GROWING UP, I NEVER SAID

01:06:34,941 --> 01:06:36,474
ANYTHING TWISTED.

1697
01:06:36,476 --> 01:06:37,709
SOMEONE ASKED WHAT I WANTED FOR

1698
01:06:37,711 --> 01:06:38,843
LUNCH, I'D SAY A SANDWICH.

1699
01:06:38,845 --> 01:06:39,544
INSTEAD OF SOMETHING AWESOME

1700

LIKE --

1701
01:06:42,649 --> 01:06:44,449

1703
01:06:47,721 --> 01:06:49,654
THEN IN COLLEGE, I PLAYED CARDS

YOU KNOW.

1706
01:06:50,924 --> 01:06:52,857
I PICKED OUT A CARD AND PEOPLE

1707
01:06:52,859 --> 01:06:54,926
