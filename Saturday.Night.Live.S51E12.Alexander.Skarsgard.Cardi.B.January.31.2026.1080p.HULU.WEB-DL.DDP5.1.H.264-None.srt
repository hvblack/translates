1
00:00:00,436 --> 00:00:03,574
>>> IN RESPONSE TO THE CHAOTIC
SITUATION IN MINNESOTA,

2
00:00:03,574 --> 00:00:06,287
PRESIDENT TRUMP ORDERED WHITE
HOUSE BORDER CZAR TOM HOMAN

3
00:00:06,287 --> 00:00:09,011
TO
TRAVEL TO MINNEAPOLIS AND TAKE
CONTROL OF THE OPERATION.

4
00:00:09,011 --> 00:00:11,315
UPON ARRIVAL, HE MET WITH I.C.E.
UNIT COMMANDERS

5
00:00:11,315 --> 00:00:13,719
TO CLARIFY THE
MISSION OBJECTIVES.

6
00:00:13,719 --> 00:00:16,655
>> ALL RIGHT, EVERYONE.

7
00:00:16,655 --> 00:00:21,257
ALL RIGHT.
THANK YOU.
ALL RIGHT.

8
00:00:21,257 --> 00:00:23,665
ALL RIGHT, EVERYONE, SETTLE
DOWN.

9
00:00:23,665 --> 00:00:25,121
MY NAME IS TOM HOMAN.

10
00:00:25,121 --> 00:00:29,742
NOW I'M SURE A LOT OF YOU ARE
WONDERING WHY GREG BOVINO, THE
LAST GUY, WAS DISMISSED.

11
00:00:29,742 --> 00:00:33,166
I WANT TO STRESS THAT IT WASN'T
BECAUSE HE DID A BAD JOB.

12
00:00:33,166 --> 00:00:36,209
OR PUBLICLY LIED ABOUT THE
SHOOTING OF AN AMERICAN CITIZEN.

13
00:00:36,309 --> 00:00:39,653
OR EVEN, OH-OH, DRESSED LIKE A
NAZI.

14
00:00:39,653 --> 00:00:44,270
IT WAS THAT HE WAS FILMED DOING
THESE THINGS.

15
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:46,762
AND THE PRESIDENT NO LIKEE THAT.

16
00:00:46,762 --> 00:00:49,407
SO I'M HERE NOW, AND WE NEED TO
TIGHTEN UP.

17
00:00:49,407 --> 00:00:51,928
THAT STARTS WITH REMEMBERING THE
MISSION OBJECTIVE.

18
00:00:52,013 --> 00:00:55,338
NOW, WHO CAN TELL ME WHY WE'RE
HERE IN MINNEAPOLIS?

19
00:00:55,338 --> 00:00:57,025
>> PASS.

20
00:00:57,025 --> 00:00:59,679
>> NOPE, CAN'T PASS.

21
00:00:59,751 --> 00:01:02,098
COME ON, GUYS.
WHAT ARE WE DOING IN
MINNEAPOLIS?

22
00:01:02,098 --> 00:01:05,722
>> THIS COULD BE WRONG, BUT
ARMY?

23
00:01:05,722 --> 00:01:08,248
>> CLOSE.
THAT'S CLOSE.

24
00:01:08,248 --> 00:01:12,856
WE'RE HERE TO DETAIN AND DEPORT
ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS WHO HAVE
COMMITTED CRIMES.

25
00:01:12,856 --> 00:01:16,621
>> THAT IS LITERALLY THE FIRST
I'M HEARING OF THAT.

26
00:01:16,621 --> 00:01:18,705
>> WELL, IT SHOULDN'T BE.

27
00:01:18,705 --> 00:01:22,048
JUST SO I KNOW WHAT WERE YOU
TOLD YOU SHOULD BE DOING?

28
00:01:22,048 --> 00:01:24,811
>> UM -- WILDING OUT.

29
00:01:24,811 --> 00:01:27,991
>> FORGET EVERYTHING YOU WERE
TOLD BEFORE.

30
00:01:27,991 --> 00:01:32,513
WE'RE NOT HERE TO INTIMIDATE,
RACIALLY PROFILE, OR VIOLATE
ANYONE'S RIGHTS.

31
00:01:32,513 --> 00:01:35,297
SO AGAIN, WHAT ARE WE LOOKING
FOR?

32
00:01:35,297 --> 00:01:37,417
>> EPSTEIN FILES?

33
00:01:37,417 --> 00:01:39,619
>> NOPE!
NOPE!

34
00:01:39,619 --> 00:01:43,087
WE ACTUALLY JUST RELEASED THOSE
TO DISTRACT FROM THIS.

35
00:01:43,087 --> 00:01:46,997
WHICH IS IRONIC, BECAUSE WE DID
THIS TO DISTRACT FROM THOSE, SO...

36
00:01:46,997 --> 00:01:50,671
ANYWAY, GUYS.
IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT DOING THE MISSION,

37
00:01:50,671 --> 00:01:52,467
IT'S ABOUT DOING IT THE
RIGHT WAY.

38
00:01:52,467 --> 00:01:57,179
A LOT OF THE BAD PRESS WE'RE
GETTING IS COMING FROM THE
AGGRESSIVE TACTICS WE'RE USING.

39
00:01:57,179 --> 00:01:59,128
>> AND THE NAZI COAT.

40
00:01:59,128 --> 00:02:02,724
>> YES, THE NAZI COAT, VERY
GOOD.

41
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:08,538
SO, LET'S TALK ABOUT USE OF
FORCE.

42
00:02:08,538 --> 00:02:10,364
WHEN DO WE WANT TO USE FORCE?

43
00:02:10,364 --> 00:02:12,061
>> RIGHT AWAY?

44
00:02:12,061 --> 00:02:15,021
>> NO.
THINK OF THE OPPOSITE.

45
00:02:15,021 --> 00:02:17,678
>> RIGHT.
PRE-EMPTIVELY.

46
00:02:17,678 --> 00:02:21,323
>> ALSO NO.
IT'S KIND OF A TRICK QUESTION,

47
00:02:21,323 --> 00:02:23,740
BECAUSE WE ACTUALLY DON'T WANT
TO USE FORCE.

48
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:28,844
REMEMBER, THE JOB ULTIMATELY IS
ABOUT KEEPING AMERICA SAFE
FROM -- WHAT?

49
00:02:28,844 --> 00:02:32,406
>> THIS COULD BE WRONG, BUT --
DON LEMON?

50
00:02:32,406 --> 00:02:35,665
>> THAT IS WRONG, YES.

51
00:02:35,665 --> 00:02:37,480
IT'S CRIMINALS.

52
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:39,418
>> TEACHER?

53
00:02:39,418 --> 00:02:42,642
>> NOT A TEACHER.
GO AHEAD.

54
00:02:42,642 --> 00:02:46,537
>> UM -- SOME OF THESE PEOPLE
PROTESTING HAVE GUNS.

55
00:02:46,537 --> 00:02:48,914
THAT SHOULDN'T BE ALLOWED,
RIGHT?

56
00:02:48,914 --> 00:02:51,046
>> WELL, LET'S FLIP IT AROUND,
RIGHT?

57
00:02:51,046 --> 00:02:54,080
HOW MANY OF YOU WENT TO A "STOP
THE STEAL" PROTEST

58
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,926
WITH A LOADED
AUTOMATIC WEAPON?

59
00:02:59,243 --> 00:03:01,706
OKAY.
THAT IS ALL OF YOU.

60
00:03:01,706 --> 00:03:02,991
SO YOU'VE GOT TO DO BETTER.

61
00:03:02,991 --> 00:03:05,674
LOOK, I'M TOM HOMAN, OKAY?

62
00:03:05,674 --> 00:03:10,681
I'M THE -- I'M THE SEPARATING
FAMILIES AT THE BORDER GUY.

63
00:03:10,681 --> 00:03:14,747
I'M THE ON-FILM TAKING A $50,000
BRIBE GUY.

64
00:03:14,747 --> 00:03:19,233
AND Y'ALL ARE MAKING ME LOOK
LIKE THE UPSTANDING, REASONABLE
ADULT IN THE ROOM.
THAT'S CRAZY!

65
00:03:19,233 --> 00:03:21,994
NOW, LET'S OPEN IT UP TO
QUESTIONS, PLEASE.
YES?

66
00:03:22,096 --> 00:03:24,639
>> I HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT THE
LOCAL POLICE.

67
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:29,026
>> THAT'S GREAT.
I WAS HOPING SOMEONE WOULD BRING
THIS UP, BECAUSE THERE'S BEEN
SOME FRICTION THERE.

68
00:03:29,026 --> 00:03:31,295
WHAT'S YOUR QUESTION ABOUT THE
LOCAL POLICE?

69
00:03:31,295 --> 00:03:35,636
>> UM -- HOW COME I WASN'T
ALLOWED TO BE IN THEM?

70
00:03:35,636 --> 00:03:38,322
>> I'M NOT SURE.

71
00:03:38,322 --> 00:03:39,934
YES, YES, YOU.

72
00:03:39,934 --> 00:03:43,588
>> UH, YES.
SO -- I HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT
DESTROYING EVIDENCE.

73
00:03:43,588 --> 00:03:45,228
>> YEAH, LET ME STOP YOU RIGHT
THERE.

74
00:03:45,228 --> 00:03:48,518
YOU SHOULD NEVER, NEVER DESTROY
EVIDENCE.

75
00:03:48,518 --> 00:03:50,833
>> GOT IT.

76
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:55,310
>> DON'T WINK.
DON'T WINK.

77
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:58,425
NOW, WHO ELSE HAS A QUESTION?
YES, YOU?

78
00:03:58,425 --> 00:04:02,224
>> YEAH, HOW COME ALL THE FAST
FOOD IN THIS CITY TASTES LIKE
SPIT?

79
00:04:02,224 --> 00:04:05,150
>> IT'S JUST BEST NOT TO THINK
ABOUT THAT.

80
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:07,801
OKAY.
WE GOT ONE MORE QUESTION.

81
00:04:07,801 --> 00:04:10,953
>> I'M BEING DETAILED TO THE
SUPER BOWL,

82
00:04:10,953 --> 00:04:14,293
 BUT I'M LOOKING IN
MY TICKET APP AND I DON'T SEE A
TICKET.

83
00:04:14,293 --> 00:04:18,092
>> RIGHT.
SO YOU WON'T ACTUALLY HAVE A
SEAT.

84
00:04:18,092 --> 00:04:22,922
>> SO WE'RE PLAYING IN IT?
LIKE WHAT?

85
00:04:22,922 --> 00:04:25,459
>> GUYS.
GUYS, NO.
NO.

86
00:04:25,459 --> 00:04:29,325
LET'S RECAP.
WHAT HAVE WE LEARNED TODAY?

87
00:04:29,325 --> 00:04:31,374
>> THIS COULD BE WRONG, BUT --

88
00:04:31,374 --> 00:04:34,128
THAT YOU HIRED A BUNCH OF ANGRY,
AGGRESSIVE GUYS, 

89
00:04:34,128 --> 00:04:38,058
GAVE US GUNS,
DIDN'T TRAIN US, SO THIS IS WHAT
YOU WANTED TO HAPPEN?

90
00:04:38,058 --> 00:04:42,010
>> COME ON, MAN, DON'T START
THINKING NOW.

91
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:44,841
DROP AND GIVE ME 20.

92
00:04:44,841 --> 00:04:48,701
>> HOW ABOUT THREE WITH KNEES
GIRL-STYLE?

93
00:04:48,701 --> 00:04:50,669
>> NEVER MIND.
LOOK.

94
00:04:50,669 --> 00:04:55,113
THE SITUATION OUT THERE HAS BEEN
ROUGH, AND WE NEED TO LOWER THE
TEMPERATURE.

95
00:04:55,113 --> 00:04:58,354
SO LET'S GET OUT THERE, LET'S
SHOW SOME RESTRAINT.

96
00:04:58,354 --> 00:05:02,485
LET'S DO OUR JOB WITHOUT
VIOLATING ANYONE'S RIGHTS AS
AMERICANS.

97
00:05:02,485 --> 00:05:05,455
CAN YOU DO THAT?
>> NO.

98
00:05:05,455 --> 00:05:08,949
>> WELL, I HAD TO ASK.
MAYBE JUST TRY NOT TO GET
FILMED.

99
00:05:08,949 --> 00:05:13,414
AND LIVE FROM NEW YORK, IT'S
SATURDAY NIGHT!

100
00:07:11,442 --> 00:07:16,085

HOST
SKARSGARD!

102
00:07:23,242 --> 00:07:28,855
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN --
ALEXANDER SKARSGARD!

103
00:07:47,971 --> 00:07:50,581
>> THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK

104
00:07:50,581 --> 00:07:53,461
I AM INCREDIBLY EXCITED TO BE
HERE TONIGHT, 

105
00:07:53,461 --> 00:07:59,275
BECAUSE WE ARE
CELEBRATING 1,000 EPISODES OF
SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE!

106
00:08:01,993 --> 00:08:06,719
¶ CELEBRATE GOOD TIMES COME ON ¶

107
00:08:10,456 --> 00:08:13,315
NOW, WHEN I WAS A KID, I LOVED
WATCHING THIS SHOW

108
00:08:13,315 --> 00:08:15,940
 FROM MY IGLOO
BACK IN STOCKHOLM.

109
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:19,440
BUT DURING THESE MONOLOGUES, I
WOULD NEVER FOCUS ON THE HOST.

110
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:22,309
I WAS MORE INTERESTED IN THE
BAND.

111
00:08:22,309 --> 00:08:24,067
BACK THERE IN THE BACKGROUND.

112
00:08:24,067 --> 00:08:26,933
SOMETIMES LAUGHING.
MORE OFTEN NOT.

113
00:08:26,933 --> 00:08:31,443
BUT ALWAYS OUT OF FOCUS.
NEVER IN THE SPOTLIGHT.

114
00:08:31,443 --> 00:08:33,485
WELL, NOT ON MY WATCH.

115
00:08:33,485 --> 00:08:36,432
CALL ME WILLY WONKA, BECAUSE
TONIGHT, 

116
00:08:36,432 --> 00:08:39,293
I'M GOING TO LET THE
LITTLE PEOPLE COOK.

117
00:08:40,433 --> 00:08:51,580
GUYS, GIVE ME SOMETHING.

118
00:08:52,082 --> 00:08:53,315
SEE, I LIKE THAT ONE.

119
00:08:53,317 --> 00:08:55,016
NICE RIGHT THERE.

120
00:08:55,018 --> 00:08:58,486
MIC, PLEASE.

121
00:09:01,091 --> 00:09:03,191
WHAT IS YOUR NAME, GOOD SIR?

122
00:09:03,193 --> 00:09:03,792
>> JAMES.

123
00:09:03,794 --> 00:09:04,559
>> BEAUTIFUL NAME.

124
00:09:04,561 --> 00:09:05,293
HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN IN THE

125
00:09:05,295 --> 00:09:05,594
BAND?

126
00:09:05,596 --> 00:09:08,096
>> 26 YEARS.

127
00:09:08,699 --> 00:09:10,665
>> THAT'S AMAZING, AMAZING.

128
00:09:10,667 --> 00:09:13,335
HOW ABOUT YOU, IS SIR?

129
00:09:13,337 --> 00:09:14,202
MUST BE PRETTY COOL TO TALK TO

130
00:09:14,204 --> 00:09:15,337
THE HOST, HUH?

131
00:09:15,339 --> 00:09:16,338
>> DEPENDS ON THE HOST.

132
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:18,006
>> YOU ARE WELCOME.

133
00:09:18,008 --> 00:09:21,276
A FEMALE.

134
00:09:21,278 --> 00:09:23,878
ON GUITAR.

135
00:09:28,885 --> 00:09:30,118

136
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:30,819
>> NO.

137
00:09:30,821 --> 00:09:31,586
>> NO?

138
00:09:31,588 --> 00:09:32,220
THAT'S WHAT I SAID NO.

139
00:09:32,222 --> 00:09:32,754
GREAT BANTER, GUYS.

140
00:09:35,626 --> 00:09:37,492
HEY -- WHO WANTS TO HEAR SOME

141
00:09:37,494 --> 00:09:37,926
FREEFORM JAZZ?

142
00:09:41,765 --> 00:09:42,330
THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT.

143
00:09:42,332 --> 00:09:46,301
SHOW ME WHAT YOU GOT.

144
00:09:47,271 --> 00:09:49,838
HELLO, WHAT HAVE WE GOT HERE?

145
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:52,073
A LITTLE STRAY SAXOPHONE.

146
00:09:52,075 --> 00:09:52,774
ALWAYS WANTED TO PLAY ONE OF

147
00:09:52,776 --> 00:09:54,509
THOSE.

148
00:10:03,253 --> 00:10:04,052
THAT WAS EASY.

149
00:10:04,054 --> 00:10:08,790
NO, NO, DON'T FOLLOW ME.

150
00:10:08,792 --> 00:10:09,324
FOCUS ON THE LADIES.

151
00:10:57,541 --> 00:10:58,106
IT FEELS GOOD TO GIVE!

152
00:11:00,177 --> 00:11:00,875
GIVE IT UP FOR THE BAND FOR

153
00:11:00,877 --> 00:11:01,176
REALS.

154
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:07,982
WE HAVE A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU.

155

173
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:11,196
AFTER I DO, YOU PROMISE YOU WILL

174
00:12:11,198 --> 00:12:13,198

00:12:17,471 --> 00:12:21,039
NO NOTHING.

178
00:12:21,041 --> 00:12:22,107
>> MOM, WHAT IS GOING ON?

179
00:12:22,109 --> 00:12:25,110
>> YEAH, YOU'RE SCARING US.

180
00:12:25,112 --> 00:12:27,779

181
00:12:27,781 --> 00:12:28,179

182
00:12:30,417 --> 00:12:31,149
AND IT'S GOING TO MAKE YOU WANT

183
00:12:31,151 --> 00:12:31,516
TO REACT.

184
00:12:33,887 --> 00:12:34,953
BUT I NEED YOU TO PROMISE THAT

185
00:12:34,955 --> 00:12:37,889

191
00:12:49,069 --> 00:12:49,400

198
00:12:58,979 --> 00:12:59,911
MY BUTT FELL OFF, I CAN'T FIND

199
00:12:59,913 --> 00:13:00,178
IT.

200
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:04,182
I DON'T HAVE A BUTT.

201
00:13:04,184 --> 00:13:07,619
OKAY, GOOD.

202

00:13:28,909 --> 00:13:29,240
>> YES!

210
00:13:29,242 --> 00:13:34,279

212
00:13:37,851 --> 00:13:44,355
BE -- BAD FOR OUR COUNTRY.

213
00:13:44,758 --> 00:13:45,190
>> OH, I DO!

214
00:13:45,192 --> 00:13:47,625
>> STOP IT!

215
00:13:47,627 --> 00:13:48,359
WHAT DID I SAY, WHAT DID I SAY?

216
00:13:51,665 --> 00:13:53,331
>> I'M SORRY, MOM, YOU'VE GOT TO

217
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:53,932
BE JOKING.

218
00:13:53,934 --> 00:13:55,567
>> WE'VE BEEN SAYING THIS SINCE

219
00:13:55,569 --> 00:13:55,867
2016.

220
00:13:55,869 --> 00:13:57,835
>> OH, I'M SORRY I'M LATE TO THE

221
00:13:57,837 --> 00:13:58,269
PERFECT PARTY.

222
00:13:58,271 --> 00:14:00,104
DO YOU GUYS WANT THIS TO BE REAL

223
00:14:00,106 --> 00:14:00,738
OR NOT?

224
00:14:01,141 --> 00:14:01,639
>> YES!

225
00:14:01,641 --> 00:14:02,407

>> THEN GIVE ME GRACE.

228
00:14:10,684 --> 00:14:16,688
I FEEL LIKE -- MAYBE -- SOME OF

229
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:19,691
THE THINGS HE SAYS -- AREN'T

230
00:14:19,693 --> 00:14:20,992
TRUE.

231
00:14:20,994 --> 00:14:22,994

>> GUYS, COME ON, CAN'T YOU SEE

237
00:14:32,138 --> 00:14:35,006

244
00:14:47,354 --> 00:14:48,620
GOOD BUSINESSMAN.

00:14:48,622 --> 00:14:50,355
>> MOM, COME ON.

246
00:14:50,357 --> 00:14:52,523

SIDE!

248
00:14:52,826 --> 00:14:53,591
YOU THINK YOU KNOW EVERYTHING

249
00:14:53,593 --> 00:14:55,893
WITH YOUR MACHO RAPPING HAMILTON

250
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:56,594
AND YOUR IUDs.

JUST HAVE KIDS ALREADY!

252
00:14:59,065 --> 00:15:02,066
>> WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

253
00:15:02,068 --> 00:15:03,268
>> MAYBE WE COULD TALK ABOUT

254
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:03,801
THIS AT RED ROBIN'S.

255
00:15:06,539 --> 00:15:07,739
I'M AFRAID THEY'RE GOING TO GIVE

256
00:15:07,741 --> 00:15:09,874
OUR TABLE AWAY, AND I WANT MY

257
00:15:09,876 --> 00:15:10,675
BIRTHDAY SCOOP.

00:15:10,677 --> 00:15:12,543
>> OKAY, MOM, WE'RE SORRY, WE'LL

259
00:15:12,545 --> 00:15:13,311
BE QUIET.

260
00:15:13,313 --> 00:15:14,045
JUST SAY WHAT YOU NEED TO SAY.

261
00:15:14,047 --> 00:15:16,214
>> FINE.

262
00:15:16,216 --> 00:15:19,550
BUT I SWEAR TO GOD --

263
00:15:19,953 --> 00:15:22,687
IF I HEAR A SINGLE "I TOLD YOU

264
00:15:22,689 --> 00:15:25,123
SO," I WILL GO SEE THE "MELANIA"

265
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:26,291
MOVIE TONIGHT.

266
00:15:26,693 --> 00:15:27,725
YOU HEAR ME?

267
00:15:27,727 --> 00:15:28,092
>> OKAY.

268
00:15:28,094 --> 00:15:30,428
>> I HEAR YOU.

269
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:35,500
>> THEN I WILL SPEAK.

270
00:15:35,502 --> 00:15:39,771
THE THINGS THAT ARE HAPPENING --

271
00:15:39,773 --> 00:15:40,471
NO ONE COULD HAVE SEEN COMING.

272
00:15:48,014 --> 00:15:50,315
I FEEL LIKE -- THE WAY THEY TALK

273
00:15:50,317 --> 00:15:56,087
ABOUT GUNS -- IS DIFFERENT --

274
00:15:56,089 --> 00:15:56,654
FOR DIFFERENT PEOPLE.

275
00:16:03,797 --> 00:16:06,364
THEY MADE ME FEEL WORRIED --

276
00:16:06,366 --> 00:16:08,399
ABOUT TRANS PEOPLE.

277
00:16:08,401 --> 00:16:12,370
BUT NOW I'M REALIZING -- I DON'T

278
00:16:12,372 --> 00:16:13,104
REALLY GET WHAT THE PROBLEM IS.

279
00:16:19,879 --> 00:16:22,447
I'M STARTING TO WONDER -- IF

280
00:16:22,449 --> 00:16:25,383
DRAG QUEENS -- ARE ACTUALLY

281
00:16:25,385 --> 00:16:25,750
HILARIOUS.

282
00:16:30,824 --> 00:16:32,523
OH, STOP THAT, I SEE WHAT YOU'RE

283
00:16:32,525 --> 00:16:32,824
DOING!

284
00:16:32,826 --> 00:16:33,424
STOP IT!

285
00:16:33,426 --> 00:16:36,094
>> ENOUGH, ENOUGH, LEAVE YOUR

286
00:16:36,096 --> 00:16:36,527
MOTHER ALONE.

287
00:16:36,529 --> 00:16:38,696
HER LAPTOP IS OLD, SHE GETS A

288
00:16:38,698 --> 00:16:40,298
DIFFERENT INTERNET THAN YOU.

289
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:41,399
>> NOT HOW THAT WORKS.

290
00:16:41,401 --> 00:16:42,967
>> THAT IS HOW THAT WORKS, AND

291
00:16:42,969 --> 00:16:44,802
THIS IS VULNERABLE FOR ME, OKAY?

292
00:16:44,804 --> 00:16:45,436
YOU SHOULD UNDERSTAND.

293
00:16:45,438 --> 00:16:47,138
WHAT DID I SAY WHEN YOU CAME

294
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:47,405

295
00:16:47,407 --> 00:16:48,806

00:16:54,881 --> 00:16:55,179
BABE.

299
00:16:55,181 --> 00:16:56,047
>> PLEASE STOP GETTING YOUR

OR SHE WON'T DANCE FOR ME

302
00:16:59,152 --> 00:16:59,484
TONIGHT.

303
00:16:59,486 --> 00:17:01,786
>> OH!

304
00:17:01,788 --> 00:17:02,520
>> YOU WOULDN'T BE HERE WITHOUT

305

IT.

306
00:17:03,723 --> 00:17:06,824
>> OKAY, RELAX.

307
00:17:06,826 --> 00:17:08,793
MOM, WE'RE SORRY.

YOU'RE RIGHT.

309

00:17:36,289 --> 00:17:39,524
IN MILAN.

328
00:17:39,526 --> 00:17:40,525
>> NO ONE SAID IT WOULD BE EASY,

329
00:17:40,527 --> 00:17:41,526
BUT IT'S ALL WORTH IT WHEN I'M

330
00:17:41,528 --> 00:17:42,760
OUT ON THE SLOPES WITH MY BOARD.

331
00:17:42,762 --> 00:17:43,761

332
00:17:43,763 --> 00:17:45,263
ALIVE.

333

IT'S WAY TOO FAST.

336
00:17:55,108 --> 00:17:55,873
IT SCARES ME TO DEATH AND I

337
00:17:55,875 --> 00:17:57,375
SERIOUSLY HATE IT.

338
00:17:57,377 --> 00:17:58,142
>> I'VE BEEN WANTING THIS MY

339

WHOLE LIFE.

340
00:17:59,145 --> 00:18:00,411

>> THIS IS A NIGHTMARE.

342
00:18:02,382 --> 00:18:04,148
I HATE THE THING I'M GOOD AT.

343
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:06,150
>> OVER 2,000 ATHLETES.

344
00:18:06,152 --> 00:18:07,618
BUT ONLY THE BEST OF THE BEST

345
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:09,387
WILL BRING HOME THE GOLD.

346
00:18:09,389 --> 00:18:10,388
>> I'VE TRAINED FOR THIS SINCE I

347
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:11,656
WAS 4 YEARS OLD.

348
00:18:11,658 --> 00:18:12,623
>> YOU'VE JUST GOT TO WANT IT.

349
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:15,126
NO ONE'S BORN THE BEST.

350
00:18:15,128 --> 00:18:16,360
>> IN LUGE, BEING THE BEST IS

351
00:18:16,362 --> 00:18:17,395
SORT OF JUST THE HEIGHT AND

352
00:18:17,397 --> 00:18:19,397
WEIGHT DISTRIBUTION THING.

353
00:18:19,399 --> 00:18:20,398
I HONESTLY THINK A CORPSE THAT'S

354
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,400
MY SAME SHAPE COULD WIN.

355
00:18:22,402 --> 00:18:23,134
>> EVERY ATHLETE BRINGS

356
00:18:23,136 --> 00:18:23,801
SOMETHING DIFFERENT TO THE

357
00:18:23,803 --> 00:18:24,368

00:18:27,407 --> 00:18:29,907
DEFINITELY MY SLOPE STYLE.

360

>> MY SIGNATURE MOVE IS

361
00:18:31,411 --> 00:18:32,143
DEFINITELY MY ENGLISH TRIPLE

EVERYONE.

365
00:18:35,915 --> 00:18:37,148
BUT I SCREAM THE WHOLE TIME.

366
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:43,888
AAHHHH!

367

>> COACHING CLARE HAS BEEN ONE

370
00:18:48,628 --> 00:18:49,393

00:18:59,105 --> 00:19:00,605
GET HER DOWN THE HILL.

375
00:19:00,607 --> 00:19:01,339
GET HER TO STOP FREAKING OUT AND

376

PRETENDING TO BE SICK, ET

CETERA?

378
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:02,707

>> I'M SICK!

381
00:19:06,646 --> 00:19:09,480

382
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:11,015
OH, LOOK AT THAT SPIDER!

383

SHE'S A ONCE-IN-A-GENERATION

386

SHAPE.

387
00:19:15,755 --> 00:19:16,487

THEMSELVES.

389
00:19:17,524 --> 00:19:19,257
THEY'RE PLAYING FOR US ALL.

390
00:19:19,259 --> 00:19:20,758
>> I'M DOING THIS FOR YOU, MOM.

391

SHE WON HER VERY FIRST EVENT.

395
00:19:29,502 --> 00:19:30,268

IT'S GO TIME FOR THE ATHLETES.

WE ARE HERE.

522

I WANT TO APOLOGIZE TO YOU.

524
00:23:51,364 --> 00:23:54,165
I'VE BECOME A STONE AROUND YOUR

525
00:23:54,167 --> 00:23:54,465
NECK.

526
00:23:54,467 --> 00:23:55,432
>> FATHER, DON'T SAY THIS.

527
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:57,201
>> ALL THESE YEARS, YOU'VE HATED

528
00:23:57,203 --> 00:23:58,102
ME FOR FLINGING YOUR MOTHER OFF

529
00:23:58,104 --> 00:24:01,939
THE DOCK.

530
00:24:01,941 --> 00:24:02,873
BUT THE TRUTH IS, SHE FLUNG

531

HERSELF.

532
00:24:05,812 --> 00:24:07,745
I WANTED TO PROTECT YOU FROM THE

533
00:24:07,747 --> 00:24:08,045
TRUTH.

534
00:24:08,047 --> 00:24:10,381
>> WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

535
00:24:10,383 --> 00:24:11,949
>> IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.

536
00:24:11,951 --> 00:24:12,583
SHE JUST DIDN'T LIKE YOU.

537
00:24:17,156 --> 00:24:18,155
BUT NOW IT'S TIME TO DROWN

538
00:24:18,157 --> 00:24:21,158
MYSELF IN THIS TUB.

539
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:23,694
SO I WILL NO LONGER HAVE TO

AS I GO DOWN IN THE WATER.

545
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:42,112

>> FETCH!

547
00:24:42,815 --> 00:24:44,315

RECENTLY, ME AND MY WIFE GOT

636
00:28:19,832 --> 00:28:21,932
INTO A LITTLE TIFF BECAUSE SHE

637

THINKS I'M TOO AFFECTIONATE WITH

638

OUR SON.

639
00:28:25,071 --> 00:28:25,636
BUT THAT IS NOT TRUE.

>> ONLY BECAUSE YOU'RE THE BEST

644
00:28:33,045 --> 00:28:35,679
SON EVER.

645
00:28:35,681 --> 00:28:37,915
>> OH!

646
00:28:37,917 --> 00:28:40,818
NO, NO!

647
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:42,953
NO, NO, NO!

648

DON'T DO IT HERE!

649
00:28:48,861 --> 00:28:52,096

650
00:28:52,098 --> 00:28:54,898
SHOWED AFFECTION TO YOU, RIGHT,

651
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:55,199
HEIKE?

652
00:28:55,201 --> 00:28:57,101
>> ONE TIME, ME AND MY FATHER

653
00:28:57,103 --> 00:28:58,869
WERE SITTING IN A SAUNA.

654
00:28:58,871 --> 00:28:59,837
AND OUR KNEECAPS ACCIDENTALLY

655
00:28:59,839 --> 00:29:00,170
TOUCHED.

656
00:29:02,975 --> 00:29:03,974
AND HE SAID, "TELL NO ONE OF

657
00:29:03,976 --> 00:29:04,274
THIS."

658
00:29:12,451 --> 00:29:13,183

659
00:29:13,185 --> 00:29:13,484
THIS.

660
00:29:16,222 --> 00:29:17,955
>> FORGIVE ME, FATHER.

661
00:29:17,957 --> 00:29:19,490
>> THE SHAME IS YOURS!

662
00:29:19,492 --> 00:29:22,626
LIVE WITH IT!

663
00:29:32,204 --> 00:29:32,769
>> WHITE PEOPLE, VERY

664
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:33,170
INTERESTING.

665
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:38,175
THEY NEVER SCREAM, YOU KNOW?

666
00:29:38,177 --> 00:29:40,611

SAW YOU AND SNORR CUTTING A GUY

725

IN HALF.

726
00:32:03,956 --> 00:32:05,389
AND I WAS STANDING RIGHT NEXT TO

00:32:05,391 --> 00:32:07,524
YOU READY WITH MY SWORD, AND NO

728
00:32:07,526 --> 00:32:08,925
ONE EVEN THOUGHT OF LIKE, HEY,

729
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:09,660
AT SOME POINT MAYBE YOU WANT TO

730
00:32:09,662 --> 00:32:13,930

KIND OF STUPID.

00:32:23,642 --> 00:32:24,908
BUT WHEN WE WERE PLAYING

735
00:32:24,910 --> 00:32:25,609

749

00:48:47,041 --> 00:48:47,907
>> OKAY, ALL RIGHT.

1172
00:48:47,909 --> 00:48:50,142
THE SEAHAWKS FAMOUSLY LOST ON

1173
00:48:50,144 --> 00:48:51,911
THE 1 YARD LINE IN 2015.

1174
00:48:51,913 --> 00:48:52,678
DO YOU THINK THIS GAME WILL BE

1175
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:53,079
THAT CLOSE?

1176
00:48:53,081 --> 00:48:55,014
>> YEAH, LOOK, FOOTBALL IS

1177
00:48:55,016 --> 00:48:56,649
FAMOUSLY A GAME OF INCHES.

1178
00:48:56,651 --> 00:48:57,416
EVERYBODY WANTS TO GO FOR SEVEN.

1179
00:48:57,418 --> 00:49:01,020
BUT -- SOMETIMES IT'S BETTER TO

1180
00:49:01,022 --> 00:49:01,821
TAKE THE THREE.

1181
00:49:14,969 --> 00:49:16,969
>> THREE?

1182
00:49:16,971 --> 00:49:17,903
>> ONE.

1183
00:49:20,174 --> 00:49:21,540
>> GOD, ONE?

1184
00:49:24,946 --> 00:49:26,579
>> LOOK, COLIN.

1185
00:49:26,581 --> 00:49:27,847
THESE ARE TWO GREAT TEAMS.

1186
00:49:27,849 --> 00:49:29,248
AND THERE'S NO DOUBT IT WILL BE

1187
00:49:29,250 --> 00:49:29,882
BACK AND FORTH ALL NIGHT.

1188
00:49:29,884 --> 00:49:32,284
>> 100%.

1189
00:49:32,286 --> 00:49:34,553
I PREDICT THAT THE PATRIOTS WILL

1190
00:49:34,555 --> 00:49:36,756
BE ON TOP FOR THE FIRST HALF.

1191
00:49:36,758 --> 00:49:39,859
THEN AT SOME POINT, THE SEAHAWKS

1192
00:49:39,861 --> 00:49:40,559
WILL COME FROM BEHIND AND --

1193
00:49:44,966 --> 00:49:45,631
DOMINATE THE PATRIOTS FOR A

1194
00:49:45,633 --> 00:49:48,567
LITTLE WHILE.

1195
00:49:48,569 --> 00:49:50,002
>> YEAH.

1196
00:49:50,004 --> 00:49:52,605
THEN MAYBE THE PATRIOTS GET

1197
00:49:52,607 --> 00:49:54,373
TIRED AND ASK THE SEAHAWKS TO

1198
00:49:54,375 --> 00:49:55,074
PLAY THEMSELVES FOR A LITTLE

1199
00:49:55,076 --> 00:49:55,374
WHILE.

1200
00:50:01,649 --> 00:50:02,581
OR THE PATRIOTS GO WATCH ON THE

1201
00:50:02,583 --> 00:50:02,948
SIDELINES.

1202
00:50:04,585 --> 00:50:05,251
>> OKAY, WHAT ARE YOU GUYS

1203
00:50:05,253 --> 00:50:05,684
TALKING ABOUT?

1204
00:50:08,356 --> 00:50:09,588
>> WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE SUPER

1205
00:50:09,590 --> 00:50:10,556
BOWL, COLIN.

1206
00:50:10,558 --> 00:50:11,924
IT'S THE BIGGEST GAME OF THE

1207
00:50:11,926 --> 00:50:12,224
YEAR.

1208
00:50:12,226 --> 00:50:13,292
SO YOU KNOW, WHATEVER HAPPENS,

1209
00:50:13,294 --> 00:50:14,026
ALL I KNOW IS -- SOMEONE'S

1210
00:50:14,028 --> 00:50:21,967
GETTING A RING.

1211
00:50:21,969 --> 00:50:23,536
>> YOU THINK THAT SOMEONE WILL

1212
00:50:23,538 --> 00:50:23,936
GET A RING?

1213
00:50:23,938 --> 00:50:26,972
>> OH, WOW.

1214
00:50:26,974 --> 00:50:27,673
WELL, PROBABLY NOT LIKE THAT

1215
00:50:27,675 --> 00:50:29,542
NIGHT.

1216
00:50:29,544 --> 00:50:32,011
>> I DIDN'T SAY THAT NIGHT.

1217
00:50:32,013 --> 00:50:33,579
>> LOOK, I THINK THE PATRIOTS

1218
00:50:33,581 --> 00:50:34,280
JUST THOUGHT THIS WAS, LIKE,

1219
00:50:34,282 --> 00:50:34,580
CHILL.

1220
00:50:36,150 --> 00:50:37,550
>> OH, OH, OKAY.

1221
00:50:37,552 --> 00:50:38,818
OH, THE PATRIOTS THOUGHT IT WAS

1222
00:50:38,820 --> 00:50:39,552
SUPER CHILL.

1223
00:50:39,554 --> 00:50:41,187
THEY THOUGHT THE SUPER BOWL WAS

1224
00:50:41,189 --> 00:50:44,056
CHILL, OKAY.

1225
00:50:44,058 --> 00:50:44,356
WELL.

1226
00:50:44,358 --> 00:50:46,826
I THINK IF THE SEAHAWKS KNEW

1227
00:50:46,828 --> 00:50:48,527
THAT, THEY WOULDN'T HAVE DONE

1228
00:50:48,529 --> 00:50:49,995
THE TUSH PUSH IN COLIN'S

1229
00:50:49,997 --> 00:50:50,463
DRESSING ROOM.

1230
00:50:50,465 --> 00:50:52,364
>> MY DRESSING ROOM AGAIN?

1231
00:50:52,366 --> 00:50:53,933
>> THE TUSH PUSH?

1232
00:50:53,935 --> 00:50:55,935
IF I RECALL, THE SEAHAWKS CALLED

1233
00:50:55,937 --> 00:50:56,435
THAT PLAY.

1234
00:50:56,437 --> 00:50:57,870
THE PATRIOTS WERE ACTUALLY

1235
00:50:57,872 --> 00:50:59,205
SCARED TO DO IT BECAUSE THEY'D

1236
00:50:59,207 --> 00:50:59,839
ONLY EVER SEEN IT ON FILM.

1237
00:51:01,709 --> 00:51:03,576
>> THE SECOND THE SEAHAWKS

1238
00:51:03,578 --> 00:51:04,310
MUTTERED TUSH PUSH, THE PATRIOTS

1239
00:51:04,312 --> 00:51:04,677
SCORED --

1240
00:51:04,679 --> 00:51:07,413
>> OKAY.

1241
00:51:07,415 --> 00:51:07,813
OH, MY GOSH.

1242
00:51:07,815 --> 00:51:08,514
TWO PEOPLE WHO JUST HOOKED UP.

1243
00:51:12,453 --> 00:51:14,820
FOR "WEEKEND UPDATE," I'M COLIN

1244
00:51:14,822 --> 00:51:15,121
JOST.

1245
00:51:15,123 --> 00:51:17,556
>> I'M MICHAEL CHE, GOOD NIGHT!

1246
00:51:44,251 --> 00:51:48,687
>> THANK YOU GIRLS FOR COMING

1247
00:51:48,689 --> 00:51:50,189
OVER TO HANG WITH AGNES.

1248
00:51:50,191 --> 00:51:51,590
SHE HASN'T REALLY HAD A CHANCE

1249
00:51:51,592 --> 00:51:53,626
TO MEET ANY OTHER KIDS SINCE WE

1250
00:51:53,628 --> 00:51:54,793
MOVED HERE FROM IOWA.

1251
00:51:54,795 --> 00:51:55,594
RIGHT, AGNES?

1252
00:51:55,596 --> 00:51:58,197
DON'T BE SHY, COME ON.

1253
00:51:58,199 --> 00:51:58,664
>> STOP IT, MOM.

1254
00:52:02,203 --> 00:52:02,902
YOU'RE EMBARRASSING ME, MOM.

1255
00:52:02,904 --> 00:52:05,437
>> COME ON, SIT.

1256
00:52:05,439 --> 00:52:05,804
BE NICE.

1257
00:52:05,806 --> 00:52:08,274
>> HI, GUYS.

1258
00:52:08,276 --> 00:52:09,341
>> HI, AGNES.

1259
00:52:09,343 --> 00:52:09,775
>> I'M AGNES.

1260
00:52:09,777 --> 00:52:12,044
>> HI, AGNES.

1261
00:52:12,046 --> 00:52:13,345
>> OH, OKAY.

1262
00:52:13,347 --> 00:52:14,547
WELL, I'M GOING TO GET OUT OF

1263
00:52:14,549 --> 00:52:15,080
YOUR HAIR.

1264
00:52:15,082 --> 00:52:17,750
YOU GIRLS HAVE FUN.

1265
00:52:17,752 --> 00:52:18,717
CALL ME IF YOU NEED ME, I'LL BE

1266
00:52:18,719 --> 00:52:20,052
DRINKING IN THE KITCHEN.

1267
00:52:20,054 --> 00:52:20,586
>> THANKS.

1268
00:52:20,588 --> 00:52:21,587
>> BYE, MOM.

1269
00:52:21,589 --> 00:52:23,222
>> AGNES, WHAT DID YOU DO BACK

1270
00:52:23,224 --> 00:52:24,723
IN IOWA FOR FUN?

1271
00:52:24,725 --> 00:52:26,158
>> I DON'T KNOW.

1272
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:27,593
LIKE, USUAL STUFF.

1273
00:52:27,595 --> 00:52:28,928
LIKE, YOU KNOW, PLAY.

1274
00:52:28,930 --> 00:52:30,062
WATCH CARTOONS.

1275
00:52:30,064 --> 00:52:32,431
HOW ABOUT YOU GUYS?

1276
00:52:32,433 --> 00:52:33,065
>> I LOVE CARTOONS.

1277
00:52:33,067 --> 00:52:34,066
HAVE YOU SEEN BLUEY?

1278
00:52:34,068 --> 00:52:34,733
>> NO.

1279
00:52:34,735 --> 00:52:37,303
>> YOU DON'T WATCH BLUEY?

1280
00:52:37,305 --> 00:52:38,704
>> NO, I'VE NEVER SEEN IT.

1281
00:52:38,706 --> 00:52:40,005
>> NOT EVEN ONCE?

1282
00:52:40,007 --> 00:52:42,441
>> I DON'T THINK SO, NO.

1283
00:52:42,443 --> 00:52:44,176
>> YOU'VE NEVER SEEN BLUEY?

1284
00:52:44,178 --> 00:52:45,811
LIKE, HOW IS THAT EVEN POSSIBLE?

1285
00:52:45,813 --> 00:52:46,445
>> I SAID I NEVER SAW IT!

1286
00:52:48,182 --> 00:52:50,916
WHO CARES!

1287
00:52:50,918 --> 00:52:51,317
>> OH, OKAY.

1288
00:52:51,319 --> 00:52:53,652
NO WORRIES.

1289
00:52:53,654 --> 00:52:54,920
>> SORRY ABOUT THAT.

1290
00:52:54,922 --> 00:52:56,889
TOTAL OOPS ON MY PART.

1291
00:52:56,891 --> 00:52:57,223
SORRY.

1292
00:52:57,225 --> 00:52:58,757
>> THAT'S OKAY.

1293
00:52:58,759 --> 00:53:00,226
ANYWAY, BLUEY IS REALLY COOL.

1294
00:53:00,228 --> 00:53:01,260
YOU SHOULD TOTALLY CHECK IT OUT.

1295
00:53:01,262 --> 00:53:06,031
>> I WILL, THANKS, JENNIFER.

1296
00:53:06,033 --> 00:53:07,600
SO, WHAT KIND OF MUSIC DO YOU

1297
00:53:07,602 --> 00:53:08,567

00:53:26,287 --> 00:53:28,120
WHAT PART OF IOWA ARE YOU FROM?

1310
00:53:28,122 --> 00:53:30,189
EVERYONE KNOWS HARRY STYLES.

1311
00:53:30,191 --> 00:53:30,889
>> WELL, I DON'T, OKAY!

1312
00:53:30,891 --> 00:53:35,127
JESUS!

1313
00:53:36,764 --> 00:53:37,429
>> OKAY.

1314
00:53:37,431 --> 00:53:39,898
I THOUGHT EVERYONE KNEW HARRY

1315
00:53:39,900 --> 00:53:40,232
STYLES.

1316
00:53:40,234 --> 00:53:41,834
>> I SAID I DON'T, OKAY?

1317
00:53:41,836 --> 00:53:42,101
GOD!

1318
00:53:42,103 --> 00:53:43,969
WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE!

1319
00:53:43,971 --> 00:53:45,904
>> NO WORRIES.

1320
00:53:45,906 --> 00:53:46,238
>> OOPS.

1321
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:47,139
SORRY.

1322
00:53:47,141 --> 00:53:50,809
I DID IT AGAIN.

1323
00:53:50,811 --> 00:53:52,111
>> HEY, GIRLS.

1324
00:53:52,113 --> 00:53:53,045
JUST CHECKING IN.

1325
00:53:53,047 --> 00:53:54,280
HOW'S EVERYONE GETTING ALONG?

1326
00:53:54,282 --> 00:53:54,947
>> GREAT.

1327
00:53:54,949 --> 00:53:56,615
WHEN WILL IT BE OVER?

1328
00:53:57,018 --> 00:53:58,517
>> OH, I TOLD YOUR MOMS TO PICK

1329
00:53:58,519 --> 00:53:59,652
YOU UP AT 7:00.

1330
00:53:59,654 --> 00:54:00,819
I ORDERED PIZZA.

1331
00:54:00,821 --> 00:54:02,021
IT WILL BE HERE ANY MINUTE.

1332
00:54:02,023 --> 00:54:03,589
>> DID YOU HEAR THAT?

1333
00:54:03,591 --> 00:54:05,157
PIZZA, I LOVE PIZZA.

00:54:05,159 --> 00:54:07,359
>> I LOVE PIZZA.

1335
00:54:07,361 --> 00:54:10,229
¶ PIZZA PIZZA PIZZA ¶

1336
00:54:10,231 --> 00:54:11,063
I LOVE IT!

1337
00:54:11,065 --> 00:54:12,531
>> IT'S ACTUALLY A REALLY COOL

1338
00:54:12,533 --> 00:54:13,165
