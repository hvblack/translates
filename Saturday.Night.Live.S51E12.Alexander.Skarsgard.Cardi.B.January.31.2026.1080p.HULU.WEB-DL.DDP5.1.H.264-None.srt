1
00:00:00,436 --> 00:00:03,574
>>> IN RESPONSE TO THE CHAOTIC
SITUATION IN MINNESOTA,

2
00:00:03,574 --> 00:00:06,287
PRESIDENT TRUMP ORDERED WHITE
HOUSE BORDER CZAR TOM HOMAN

3
00:00:06,287 --> 00:00:09,011
TO
TRAVEL TO MINNEAPOLIS AND TAKE
CONTROL OF THE OPERATION.

4
00:00:09,011 --> 00:00:11,315
UPON ARRIVAL, HE MET WITH I.C.E.
UNIT COMMANDERS

5
00:00:11,315 --> 00:00:13,719
TO CLARIFY THE
MISSION OBJECTIVES.

6
00:00:13,719 --> 00:00:16,655
>> ALL RIGHT, EVERYONE.

7
00:00:16,655 --> 00:00:21,257
ALL RIGHT.
THANK YOU.
ALL RIGHT.

8
00:00:21,257 --> 00:00:23,665
ALL RIGHT, EVERYONE, SETTLE
DOWN.

9
00:00:23,665 --> 00:00:25,121
MY NAME IS TOM HOMAN.

10
00:00:25,121 --> 00:00:29,742
NOW I'M SURE A LOT OF YOU ARE
WONDERING WHY GREG BOVINO, THE
LAST GUY, WAS DISMISSED.

11
00:00:29,742 --> 00:00:33,166
I WANT TO STRESS THAT IT WASN'T
BECAUSE HE DID A BAD JOB.

12
00:00:33,166 --> 00:00:36,209
OR PUBLICLY LIED ABOUT THE
SHOOTING OF AN AMERICAN CITIZEN.

13
00:00:36,309 --> 00:00:39,653
OR EVEN, OH-OH, DRESSED LIKE A
NAZI.

14
00:00:39,653 --> 00:00:44,270
IT WAS THAT HE WAS FILMED DOING
THESE THINGS.

15
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:46,762
AND THE PRESIDENT NO LIKEE THAT.

16
00:00:46,762 --> 00:00:49,407
SO I'M HERE NOW, AND WE NEED TO
TIGHTEN UP.

17
00:00:49,407 --> 00:00:51,928
THAT STARTS WITH REMEMBERING THE
MISSION OBJECTIVE.

18
00:00:52,013 --> 00:00:55,338
NOW, WHO CAN TELL ME WHY WE'RE
HERE IN MINNEAPOLIS?

19
00:00:55,338 --> 00:00:57,025
>> PASS.

20
00:00:57,025 --> 00:00:59,679
>> NOPE, CAN'T PASS.

21
00:00:59,751 --> 00:01:02,098
COME ON, GUYS.
WHAT ARE WE DOING IN
MINNEAPOLIS?

22
00:01:02,098 --> 00:01:05,722
>> THIS COULD BE WRONG, BUT
ARMY?

23
00:01:05,722 --> 00:01:08,248
>> CLOSE.
THAT'S CLOSE.

24
00:01:08,248 --> 00:01:12,856
WE'RE HERE TO DETAIN AND DEPORT
ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS WHO HAVE
COMMITTED CRIMES.

25
00:01:12,856 --> 00:01:16,621
>> THAT IS LITERALLY THE FIRST
I'M HEARING OF THAT.

26
00:01:16,621 --> 00:01:18,705
>> WELL, IT SHOULDN'T BE.

27
00:01:18,705 --> 00:01:22,048
JUST SO I KNOW WHAT WERE YOU
TOLD YOU SHOULD BE DOING?

28
00:01:22,048 --> 00:01:24,811
>> UM -- WILDING OUT.

29
00:01:24,811 --> 00:01:27,991
>> FORGET EVERYTHING YOU WERE
TOLD BEFORE.

30
00:01:27,991 --> 00:01:32,513
WE'RE NOT HERE TO INTIMIDATE,
RACIALLY PROFILE, OR VIOLATE
ANYONE'S RIGHTS.

31
00:01:32,513 --> 00:01:35,297
SO AGAIN, WHAT ARE WE LOOKING
FOR?

32
00:01:35,297 --> 00:01:37,417
>> EPSTEIN FILES?

33
00:01:37,417 --> 00:01:39,619
>> NOPE!
NOPE!

34
00:01:39,619 --> 00:01:43,087
WE ACTUALLY JUST RELEASED THOSE
TO DISTRACT FROM THIS.

35
00:01:43,087 --> 00:01:46,997
WHICH IS IRONIC, BECAUSE WE DID
THIS TO DISTRACT FROM THOSE, SO...

36
00:01:46,997 --> 00:01:50,671
ANYWAY, GUYS.
IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT DOING THE MISSION,

37
00:01:50,671 --> 00:01:52,467
IT'S ABOUT DOING IT THE
RIGHT WAY.

38
00:01:52,467 --> 00:01:57,179
A LOT OF THE BAD PRESS WE'RE
GETTING IS COMING FROM THE
AGGRESSIVE TACTICS WE'RE USING.

39
00:01:57,179 --> 00:01:59,128
>> AND THE NAZI COAT.

40
00:01:59,128 --> 00:02:02,724
>> YES, THE NAZI COAT, VERY
GOOD.

41
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:08,538
SO, LET'S TALK ABOUT USE OF
FORCE.

42
00:02:08,538 --> 00:02:10,364
WHEN DO WE WANT TO USE FORCE?

43
00:02:10,364 --> 00:02:12,061
>> RIGHT AWAY?

44
00:02:12,061 --> 00:02:15,021
>> NO.
THINK OF THE OPPOSITE.

45
00:02:15,021 --> 00:02:17,678
>> RIGHT.
PRE-EMPTIVELY.

46
00:02:17,678 --> 00:02:21,323
>> ALSO NO.
IT'S KIND OF A TRICK QUESTION,

47
00:02:21,323 --> 00:02:23,740
BECAUSE WE ACTUALLY DON'T WANT
TO USE FORCE.

48
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:28,844
REMEMBER, THE JOB ULTIMATELY IS
ABOUT KEEPING AMERICA SAFE
FROM -- WHAT?

49
00:02:28,844 --> 00:02:32,406
>> THIS COULD BE WRONG, BUT --
DON LEMON?

50
00:02:32,406 --> 00:02:35,665
>> THAT IS WRONG, YES.

51
00:02:35,665 --> 00:02:37,480
IT'S CRIMINALS.

52
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:39,418
>> TEACHER?

53
00:02:39,418 --> 00:02:42,642
>> NOT A TEACHER.
GO AHEAD.

54
00:02:42,642 --> 00:02:46,537
>> UM -- SOME OF THESE PEOPLE
PROTESTING HAVE GUNS.

55
00:02:46,537 --> 00:02:48,914
THAT SHOULDN'T BE ALLOWED,
RIGHT?

56
00:02:48,914 --> 00:02:51,046
>> WELL, LET'S FLIP IT AROUND,
RIGHT?

57
00:02:51,046 --> 00:02:54,080
HOW MANY OF YOU WENT TO A "STOP
THE STEAL" PROTEST

58
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,926
WITH A LOADED
AUTOMATIC WEAPON?

59
00:02:59,243 --> 00:03:01,706
OKAY.
THAT IS ALL OF YOU.

60
00:03:01,706 --> 00:03:02,991
SO YOU'VE GOT TO DO BETTER.

61
00:03:02,991 --> 00:03:05,674
LOOK, I'M TOM HOMAN, OKAY?

62
00:03:05,674 --> 00:03:10,681
I'M THE -- I'M THE SEPARATING
FAMILIES AT THE BORDER GUY.

63
00:03:10,681 --> 00:03:14,747
I'M THE ON-FILM TAKING A $50,000
BRIBE GUY.

64
00:03:14,747 --> 00:03:19,233
AND Y'ALL ARE MAKING ME LOOK
LIKE THE UPSTANDING, REASONABLE
ADULT IN THE ROOM.
THAT'S CRAZY!

65
00:03:19,233 --> 00:03:21,994
NOW, LET'S OPEN IT UP TO
QUESTIONS, PLEASE.
YES?

66
00:03:22,096 --> 00:03:24,639
>> I HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT THE
LOCAL POLICE.

67
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:29,026
>> THAT'S GREAT.
I WAS HOPING SOMEONE WOULD BRING
THIS UP, BECAUSE THERE'S BEEN
SOME FRICTION THERE.

68
00:03:29,026 --> 00:03:31,295
WHAT'S YOUR QUESTION ABOUT THE
LOCAL POLICE?

69
00:03:31,295 --> 00:03:35,636
>> UM -- HOW COME I WASN'T
ALLOWED TO BE IN THEM?

70
00:03:35,636 --> 00:03:38,322
>> I'M NOT SURE.

71
00:03:38,322 --> 00:03:39,934
YES, YES, YOU.

72
00:03:39,934 --> 00:03:43,588
>> UH, YES.
SO -- I HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT
DESTROYING EVIDENCE.

73
00:03:43,588 --> 00:03:45,228
>> YEAH, LET ME STOP YOU RIGHT
THERE.

74
00:03:45,228 --> 00:03:48,518
YOU SHOULD NEVER, NEVER DESTROY
EVIDENCE.

75
00:03:48,518 --> 00:03:50,833
>> GOT IT.

76
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:55,310
>> DON'T WINK.
DON'T WINK.

77
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:58,425
NOW, WHO ELSE HAS A QUESTION?
YES, YOU?

78
00:03:58,425 --> 00:04:02,224
>> YEAH, HOW COME ALL THE FAST
FOOD IN THIS CITY TASTES LIKE
SPIT?

79
00:04:02,224 --> 00:04:05,150
>> IT'S JUST BEST NOT TO THINK
ABOUT THAT.

80
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:07,801
OKAY.
WE GOT ONE MORE QUESTION.

81
00:04:07,801 --> 00:04:10,953
>> I'M BEING DETAILED TO THE
SUPER BOWL,

82
00:04:10,953 --> 00:04:14,293
BUT I'M LOOKING IN
MY TICKET APP AND I DON'T SEE A
TICKET.

83
00:04:14,293 --> 00:04:18,092
>> RIGHT.
SO YOU WON'T ACTUALLY HAVE A
SEAT.

84
00:04:18,092 --> 00:04:22,922
>> SO WE'RE PLAYING IN IT?
LIKE WHAT?

85
00:04:22,922 --> 00:04:25,459
>> GUYS.
GUYS, NO.
NO.

86
00:04:25,459 --> 00:04:29,325
LET'S RECAP.
WHAT HAVE WE LEARNED TODAY?

87
00:04:29,325 --> 00:04:31,374
>> THIS COULD BE WRONG, BUT --

88
00:04:31,374 --> 00:04:34,128
THAT YOU HIRED A BUNCH OF ANGRY,
AGGRESSIVE GUYS,

89
00:04:34,128 --> 00:04:38,058
GAVE US GUNS,
DIDN'T TRAIN US, SO THIS IS WHAT
YOU WANTED TO HAPPEN?

90
00:04:38,058 --> 00:04:42,010
>> COME ON, MAN, DON'T START
THINKING NOW.

91
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:44,841
DROP AND GIVE ME 20.

92
00:04:44,841 --> 00:04:48,701
>> HOW ABOUT THREE WITH KNEES
GIRL-STYLE?

93
00:04:48,701 --> 00:04:50,669
>> NEVER MIND.
LOOK.

94
00:04:50,669 --> 00:04:55,113
THE SITUATION OUT THERE HAS BEEN
ROUGH, AND WE NEED TO LOWER THE
TEMPERATURE.

95
00:04:55,113 --> 00:04:58,354
SO LET'S GET OUT THERE, LET'S
SHOW SOME RESTRAINT.

96
00:04:58,354 --> 00:05:02,485
LET'S DO OUR JOB WITHOUT
VIOLATING ANYONE'S RIGHTS AS
AMERICANS.

97
00:05:02,485 --> 00:05:05,455
CAN YOU DO THAT?
>> NO.

98
00:05:05,455 --> 00:05:08,949
>> WELL, I HAD TO ASK.
MAYBE JUST TRY NOT TO GET
FILMED.

99
00:05:08,949 --> 00:05:13,414
AND LIVE FROM NEW YORK, IT'S
SATURDAY NIGHT!

100
00:07:11,442 --> 00:07:16,085
MUSICAL

101

HOST
SKARSGARD!

102
00:07:23,242 --> 00:07:28,855
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN --
ALEXANDER SKARSGARD!

103
00:07:47,971 --> 00:07:50,581
>> THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK

104
00:07:50,581 --> 00:07:53,461
I AM INCREDIBLY EXCITED TO BE
HERE TONIGHT,

105
00:07:53,461 --> 00:07:59,275
BECAUSE WE ARE

SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE!

106
00:08:01,993 --> 00:08:06,719
¶ CELEBRATE GOOD TIMES COME ON ¶

107
00:08:10,456 --> 00:08:13,315
NOW, WHEN I WAS A KID, I LOVED
WATCHING THIS SHOW

108
00:08:13,315 --> 00:08:15,940
FROM MY IGLOO
BACK IN STOCKHOLM.

109
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:19,440
BUT DURING THESE MONOLOGUES, I
WOULD NEVER FOCUS ON THE HOST.

110
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:22,309
I WAS MORE INTERESTED IN THE
BAND.

111
00:08:22,309 --> 00:08:24,067
BACK THERE IN THE BACKGROUND.

112
00:08:24,067 --> 00:08:26,933
SOMETIMES LAUGHING.
MORE OFTEN NOT.

113
00:08:26,933 --> 00:08:31,443
BUT ALWAYS OUT OF FOCUS.
NEVER IN THE SPOTLIGHT.

114
00:08:31,443 --> 00:08:33,485
WELL, NOT ON MY WATCH.

115
00:08:33,485 --> 00:08:36,432
CALL ME WILLY WONKA, BECAUSE
TONIGHT,

116
00:08:36,432 --> 00:08:39,293
I'M GOING TO LET THE
LITTLE PEOPLE COOK.

117
00:08:40,433 --> 00:08:43,245
GUYS, GIVE ME SOMETHING.

118
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,620
SEE, I LIKE THAT ONE.

119
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:48,959
NICE RIGHT THERE.
MIC, PLEASE.

120
00:08:49,608 --> 00:08:51,838
COME

121
00:08:54,612 --> 00:08:57,249
WHAT IS YOUR NAME, GOOD SIR?
>> JAMES.

122
00:08:57,249 --> 00:08:59,603

HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN IN THE
BAND?

123
00:08:59,603 --> 00:09:03,955
>> 26 YEARS, BUT
>> THAT'S AMAZING, AMAZING.

124
00:09:03,955 --> 00:09:08,544
HOW ABOUT YOU, IS SIR?
MUST BE PRETTY COOL TO TALK TO
THE HOST, HUH?

125
00:09:08,544 --> 00:09:11,743
>> DEPENDS ON THE HOST.
>> YOU ARE WELCOME.

126
00:09:12,291 --> 00:09:17,814
A FEMALE.
ON GUITAR.

127
00:09:18,658 --> 00:09:23,848
YBANEZ 2000, NO?
>> NO.

128
00:09:23,848 --> 00:09:25,387
>> NO?
THAT'S WHAT I SAID NO.

129
00:09:25,491 --> 00:09:27,634
GREAT BANTER, GUYS.

130
00:09:28,307 --> 00:09:34,207
HEY -- WHO WANTS TO HEAR SOME
FREEFORM JAZZ?

131
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:37,534
THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT.
SHOW ME WHAT YOU GOT.

132
00:09:39,776 --> 00:09:44,317
WHAT HAVE WE GOT HERE?
A LITTLE STRAY SAXOPHONE.

133
00:09:44,317 --> 00:09:47,401
ALWAYS WANTED TO PLAY ONE OF
THOSE.

134
00:09:54,031 --> 00:09:57,949
THAT WAS EASY.
NO, NO, DON'T FOLLOW ME.

135
00:09:57,949 --> 00:10:01,781
FOCUS ON THE LADIES.

136
00:10:10,344 --> 00:10:12,927
POWER

137
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:17,493
YOU

138
00:10:49,924 --> 00:10:53,308
IT FEELS GOOD TO GIVE!

139
00:10:53,308 --> 00:10:56,581
GIVE IT UP FOR THE BAND FOR
REALS.

140
00:10:59,297 --> 00:11:03,349
WE HAVE A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU.
CARDI B IS HERE.

141
00:11:04,027 --> 00:11:06,901
STICK AROUND, WE'LL BE RIGHT
BACK!

142
00:11:36,388 --> 00:11:40,438
THANKS
MOM AND DAD.

143
00:11:40,438 --> 00:11:42,083
>> OF COURSE.

144
00:11:42,083 --> 00:11:44,584
>> WE LOVE YOU, WE LOVE YOU.

145
00:11:44,584 --> 00:11:48,610
>> SHOULD WE HEAD TO THE
RESTAURANT?
I'M STARVING.

146
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:49,965
>> OH, YEAH.
>> SURE.

147
00:11:50,047 --> 00:11:53,513
>> OH, OH -- WAIT.
WAIT, THERE'S --

148
00:11:53,623 --> 00:11:56,552
THERE'S
SOMETHING I NEED TO TELL YOU ALL
FIRST.

149
00:11:56,552 --> 00:11:59,973
>> OH, OKAY, WHAT IS IT, MOM?
>> IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

150
00:11:59,973 --> 00:12:04,310
>> I'M ONLY GOING TO SAY IT IF,
AFTER I DO,

151
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:07,862
YOU PROMISE YOU WILL
NOT REACT.

152
00:12:07,862 --> 00:12:12,011
NO TALKING.
NO FACES.

153
00:12:12,011 --> 00:12:14,265
NO NOTHING.

154
00:12:14,265 --> 00:12:18,596
>> MOM, WHAT IS GOING ON?
>> YEAH, YOU'RE SCARING US.

155
00:12:18,596 --> 00:12:23,968
>> THE THING I'M GOING TO SAY --
IS SHOCKING.

156
00:12:23,968 --> 00:12:27,300
AND IT'S GOING TO MAKE YOU WANT
TO REACT.

157
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:31,492
BUT I NEED YOU TO PROMISE THAT
YOU WILL NOT.

158
00:12:31,492 --> 00:12:33,479
>> FINE.
>> SURE, YEAH.

159
00:12:33,479 --> 00:12:34,924
>> LET'S DO A PRACTICE EXAMPLE.

160
00:12:34,924 --> 00:12:39,109
I EAT BUGS.

161
00:12:40,087 --> 00:12:41,664
>> MOM.
IS THAT --

162
00:12:41,664 --> 00:12:44,600

00:12:49,496 --> 00:12:51,238
PRACTICE EXAMPLE.

166
00:12:51,238 --> 00:12:53,044
MY BUTT FELL OFF, I CAN'T FIND
IT.

167
00:12:53,044 --> 00:12:55,641
I DON'T HAVE A BUTT.

168
00:12:58,657 --> 00:13:01,062
OKAY, GOOD.

169
00:13:01,456 --> 00:13:04,348
WHAT I HAVE TO TELL YOU --

170
00:13:05,029 --> 00:13:09,329
IS I MAY HAVE CHANGED MY MIND --

171
00:13:10,372 --> 00:13:13,426
ABOUT TRUMP.

172
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:18,121
>> WHAT?
>> YEAH!

173
00:13:18,121 --> 00:13:22,114
>> STOP IT, STOP IT!
YOU WANT THIS TO BE REAL OR NOT?

174
00:13:22,114 --> 00:13:25,227
>> YES!
>> SURE, YEAH.

175
00:13:28,012 --> 00:13:31,597
>> I FEEL NOW --

176
00:13:31,597 --> 00:13:35,263
LIKE HE MIGHT BE --

177
00:13:35,788 --> 00:13:38,275
BAD FOR OUR COUNTRY.

178
00:13:38,275 --> 00:13:40,068
>> OH, I DO!
>> STOP IT!

179
00:13:40,068 --> 00:13:43,813
WHAT DID I SAY, WHAT DID I SAY?

180
00:13:44,007 --> 00:13:47,342
>> I'M SORRY, MOM, YOU'VE GOT TO
BE JOKING.

181
00:13:47,342 --> 00:13:49,509
>> WE'VE BEEN SAYING THIS SINCE
2016.

182
00:13:49,509 --> 00:13:51,837
>> OH, I'M SORRY I'M LATE TO THE
PERFECT PARTY.

183
00:13:51,837 --> 00:13:54,401
DO YOU GUYS WANT THIS TO BE REAL
OR NOT?

184
00:13:54,401 --> 00:13:55,754
>> YES!
>> YES, ABSOLUTE.

185
00:13:55,754 --> 00:14:00,288
>> WE WANT IT TO BE REAL.
>> THEN GIVE ME GRACE.

186
00:14:04,465 --> 00:14:10,435
I FEEL LIKE -- MAYBE --

187
00:14:10,435 --> 00:14:13,808
SOME OF THE THINGS HE SAYS --

188
00:14:13,808 --> 00:14:16,175
AREN'T TRUE.

189
00:14:16,175 --> 00:14:18,054
>> OH!
>> MOM!

190
00:14:18,194 --> 00:14:21,795
>> BYE, I TAKE IT BACK!

191
00:14:21,795 --> 00:14:24,606
>> MOM, COME ON.
DON'T DO THAT.

192
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:28,241
>> GUYS, COME ON, CAN'T YOU SEE
THIS IS HARD FOR YOUR MOTHER?

193
00:14:28,241 --> 00:14:33,984
ALSO, I WANT TO REMIND
EVERYBODY, IT IS MY BIRTHDAY.

194
00:14:33,984 --> 00:14:35,732
>> AND GREG, WE ARE GOING TO GET
TO THAT.

195
00:14:35,732 --> 00:14:37,926
AND FOR THE RECORD, YOU LITTLE BRATS,

196
00:14:37,926 --> 00:14:40,493
I DO STILL THINK HE'S A
GOOD BUSINESSMAN.

197
00:14:40,493 --> 00:14:42,819
>> MOM, COME ON.

198
00:14:42,819 --> 00:14:45,640
>> THIS IS WHY NOBODY LIKES YOUR
SIDE!

199
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:47,304
YOU THINK YOU KNOW EVERYTHING

200
00:14:47,304 --> 00:14:50,656
WITH YOUR MACHO RAPPING HAMILTON
AND YOUR IUDs.

201
00:14:50,656 --> 00:14:53,302
JUST HAVE KIDS ALREADY!

202
00:14:53,302 --> 00:14:55,733
>> WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

203
00:14:55,733 --> 00:14:58,857
>> MAYBE WE COULD TALK ABOUT
THIS AT RED ROBIN'S.

204
00:14:58,857 --> 00:15:03,367
I'M AFRAID THEY'RE GOING TO GIVE
OUR TABLE AWAY, AND I WANT MY
BIRTHDAY SCOOP.

205
00:15:03,367 --> 00:15:07,796
>> OKAY, MOM, WE'RE SORRY, WE'LL
BE QUIET.
JUST SAY WHAT YOU NEED TO SAY.

206
00:15:07,796 --> 00:15:12,615
>> FINE.
BUT I SWEAR TO GOD --

207
00:15:12,615 --> 00:15:15,430
IF I HEAR A SINGLE "I TOLD YOU SO," 

208
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:19,091
I WILL GO SEE THE "MELANIA"
MOVIE TONIGHT.

209
00:15:19,091 --> 00:15:20,792
YOU HEAR ME?

210
00:15:20,886 --> 00:15:24,187
>> OKAY.
>> REALLY

211
00:15:24,187 --> 00:15:27,028
>> THEN I WILL SPEAK.

212
00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:32,753
THE THINGS THAT ARE HAPPENING --

213
00:15:32,753 --> 00:15:36,958
NO ONE COULD HAVE SEEN COMING.

214
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:47,060
I FEEL LIKE -- THE WAY THEY TALK
ABOUT GUNS --

215
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:52,405
 IS DIFFERENT --
FOR DIFFERENT PEOPLE.

216
00:15:56,995 --> 00:15:59,915
THEY MADE ME FEEL WORRIED --

217
00:15:59,915 --> 00:16:02,448
ABOUT TRANS PEOPLE.

218
00:16:02,448 --> 00:16:05,174
BUT NOW I'M REALIZING --

219
00:16:05,174 --> 00:16:09,509
 I DON'T REALLY GET WHAT THE PROBLEM IS.

220
00:16:13,172 --> 00:16:16,191
I'M STARTING TO WONDER -- 

221
00:16:16,191 --> 00:16:21,877
IF DRAG QUEENS -- ARE ACTUALLY
HILARIOUS.

222
00:16:22,599 --> 00:16:25,425
OH, STOP THAT, I SEE WHAT YOU'RE
DOING!
STOP IT!

223
00:16:25,425 --> 00:16:28,270
>> ENOUGH, ENOUGH, LEAVE YOUR
MOTHER ALONE.

224
00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:32,927
HER LAPTOP IS OLD, SHE GETS A
DIFFERENT INTERNET THAN YOU.

225
00:16:32,927 --> 00:16:34,672
>> NOT HOW THAT WORKS.

226
00:16:34,672 --> 00:16:38,334
>> THAT IS HOW THAT WORKS, AND
THIS IS VULNERABLE FOR ME, OKAY?

227
00:16:38,334 --> 00:16:40,941
YOU SHOULD UNDERSTAND.
WHAT DID I SAY WHEN YOU CAME
OUT?

228
00:16:40,941 --> 00:16:44,994
>> YOU SAID, IS IT POSSIBLE YOU
JUST LIKE HATS?

229
00:16:44,994 --> 00:16:47,833
>> STILL WAITING ON THE ANSWER,
BABE.

230
00:16:47,833 --> 00:16:50,560
>> PLEASE STOP GETTING YOUR
MOTHER WORKED UP.

231
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:53,411
OR SHE WON'T DANCE FOR ME
TONIGHT.

232
00:16:53,411 --> 00:16:57,163
DANCE
>> YOU WOULDN'T BE HERE WITHOUT
IT.

233
00:16:57,163 --> 00:16:59,604
>> OKAY, RELAX.

234
00:16:59,604 --> 00:17:02,723
MOM, WE'RE SORRY.
YOU'RE RIGHT.

235
00:17:02,723 --> 00:17:05,930
WE SHOULDN'T HAVE MADE THIS HARD
FOR YOU, AND WE'RE HAPPY THAT
YOU TOLD US.

236
00:17:05,930 --> 00:17:08,757
>> YEAH.
>> WE'RE SORRY.
>> THANKS, MOM.

237
00:17:08,757 --> 00:17:12,480
>> ALL RIGHT.
LET'S GET TO DINNER.

238
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,554
PLENTY OF ROOM IN THE
CYBERTRUCK.

239
00:17:14,554 --> 00:17:17,792
>> SELL THAT!
>> ARE YOU KIDDING?

240
00:17:22,546 --> 00:17:25,294
>>> THE WINTER OLYMPICS ARE A
WEEK AWAY.

241
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:33,785
NOW MEET SOME OF THE ATHLETES

242
00:17:33,787 --> 00:17:34,519
WHO PUSHED THEMSELVES TO THE

243
00:17:34,521 --> 00:17:35,253
LIMIT OF HUMAN ENDURANCE FOR THE

244
00:17:35,255 --> 00:17:36,287
CHANCE TO COMPETE AT THE GAMES

245
00:17:36,289 --> 00:17:39,524
IN MILAN.

246
00:17:39,526 --> 00:17:40,525
>> NO ONE SAID IT WOULD BE EASY,

247
00:17:40,527 --> 00:17:41,526
BUT IT'S ALL WORTH IT WHEN I'M

248
00:17:41,528 --> 00:17:42,760
OUT ON THE SLOPES WITH MY BOARD.

249
00:17:42,762 --> 00:17:43,761
>> WHEN I'M ON THE ICE, I FEEL

250
00:17:43,763 --> 00:17:45,263
ALIVE.

251
00:17:45,265 --> 00:17:49,834
>> IT'S MY PURPOSE.

252
00:17:49,836 --> 00:17:51,636
>> I HATE THE LUGE.

253
00:17:51,638 --> 00:17:55,106
IT'S WAY TOO FAST.

254
00:17:55,108 --> 00:17:55,873
IT SCARES ME TO DEATH AND I

255
00:17:55,875 --> 00:17:57,375
SERIOUSLY HATE IT.

256
00:17:57,377 --> 00:17:58,142
>> I'VE BEEN WANTING THIS MY

257
00:17:58,144 --> 00:17:59,143
WHOLE LIFE.

258
00:17:59,145 --> 00:18:00,411
I'M LIVING MY DREAM.

259
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:02,380
>> THIS IS A NIGHTMARE.

260
00:18:02,382 --> 00:18:04,148
I HATE THE THING I'M GOOD AT.

261
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:06,150
>> OVER 2,000 ATHLETES.

262
00:18:06,152 --> 00:18:07,618
BUT ONLY THE BEST OF THE BEST

263
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:09,387
WILL BRING HOME THE GOLD.

264

>> I'VE TRAINED FOR THIS SINCE I

265
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:11,656
WAS 4 YEARS OLD.

266
00:18:11,658 --> 00:18:12,623
>> YOU'VE JUST GOT TO WANT IT.

267
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:15,126
NO ONE'S BORN THE BEST.

268
00:18:15,128 --> 00:18:16,360
>> IN LUGE, BEING THE BEST IS

269
00:18:16,362 --> 00:18:17,395
SORT OF JUST THE HEIGHT AND

270
00:18:17,397 --> 00:18:19,397
WEIGHT DISTRIBUTION THING.

271
00:18:19,399 --> 00:18:20,398
I HONESTLY THINK A CORPSE THAT'S

272
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,400
MY SAME SHAPE COULD WIN.

273
00:18:22,402 --> 00:18:23,134
>> EVERY ATHLETE BRINGS

274
00:18:23,136 --> 00:18:23,801
SOMETHING DIFFERENT TO THE

275
00:18:23,803 --> 00:18:24,368
TABLE.

276

EVERYONE.

283
00:18:35,915 --> 00:18:37,148
BUT I SCREAM THE WHOLE TIME.

284
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:43,888
AAHHHH!

285

00:18:59,105 --> 00:19:00,605
GET HER DOWN THE HILL.

293
00:19:00,607 --> 00:19:01,339
GET HER TO STOP FREAKING OUT AND

WE STAY SILENT.

539
00:27:46,899 --> 00:27:48,332
VERY INTENT.

540
00:27:48,334 --> 00:27:50,434
THEN ONE DAY, FINALLY, WE DIE.

541
00:27:52,605 --> 00:27:55,406
>> OKAY.

542
00:27:55,408 --> 00:27:55,973

RECENTLY, ME AND MY WIFE GOT

554
00:28:19,832 --> 00:28:21,932
INTO A LITTLE TIFF BECAUSE SHE

555
00:28:21,934 --> 00:28:23,801
THINKS I'M TOO AFFECTIONATE WITH

556
00:28:23,803 --> 00:28:25,069
OUR SON.

557
00:28:25,071 --> 00:28:25,636
BUT THAT IS NOT TRUE.

558
00:28:25,638 --> 00:28:30,240
RIGHT, CONNER?

559
00:28:30,242 --> 00:28:30,908
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

560
00:28:30,910 --> 00:28:32,309
YOU'RE THE BEST DAD EVER.

561
00:28:32,311 --> 00:28:33,043
>> ONLY BECAUSE YOU'RE THE BEST

562
00:28:33,045 --> 00:28:35,679
SON EVER.

563
00:28:35,681 --> 00:28:37,915
>> OH!

SHOWED AFFECTION TO YOU, RIGHT,

569
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:55,199
HEIKE?

570
00:28:55,201 --> 00:28:57,101
>> ONE TIME, ME AND MY FATHER

571
00:28:57,103 --> 00:28:58,869
WERE SITTING IN A SAUNA.

572
00:28:58,871 --> 00:28:59,837
AND OUR KNEECAPS ACCIDENTALLY

573
00:28:59,839 --> 00:29:00,170
TOUCHED.

574
00:29:02,975 --> 00:29:03,974
AND HE SAID, "TELL NO ONE OF

575
00:29:03,976 --> 00:29:04,274
THIS."

576
00:29:12,451 --> 00:29:13,183
>> I TOLD YOU, TELL NO ONE OF

577
00:29:13,185 --> 00:29:13,484
THIS.

578
00:29:16,222 --> 00:29:17,955
>> FORGIVE ME, FATHER.

579
00:29:17,957 --> 00:29:19,490
>> THE SHAME IS YOURS!

580
00:29:19,492 --> 00:29:22,626
LIVE WITH IT!

581
00:29:32,204 --> 00:29:32,769

00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:33,170
INTERESTING.

583
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:38,175
THEY NEVER SCREAM, YOU KNOW?

584
00:29:38,177 --> 00:29:40,611
THEY JUST PUSH IT DOWN, DOWN,

585
00:29:40,613 --> 00:29:40,911
DOWN.

586
00:29:40,913 --> 00:29:42,813
AND THEN ONE DAY, THEY KILL

587
00:29:42,815 --> 00:29:43,380

SCARED BECAUSE -- THEY HAVEN'T

1083

1088
00:48:43,905 --> 00:48:44,437
YOU COULD SAY THAT.

1089
00:48:47,041 --> 00:48:47,907
>> OKAY, ALL RIGHT.

1090
00:48:47,909 --> 00:48:50,142

THAT CLOSE?

1094
00:48:53,081 --> 00:48:55,014
>> YEAH, LOOK, FOOTBALL IS

1095
00:48:55,016 --> 00:48:56,649
FAMOUSLY A GAME OF INCHES.

1096
00:48:56,651 --> 00:48:57,416
EVERYBODY WANTS TO GO FOR SEVEN.

1097
00:48:57,418 --> 00:49:01,020
BUT -- SOMETIMES IT'S BETTER TO

1098
00:49:01,022 --> 00:49:01,821
TAKE THE THREE.

1099
00:49:14,969 --> 00:49:16,969
>> THREE?

1100
00:49:16,971 --> 00:49:17,903
>> ONE.

1101
00:49:20,174 --> 00:49:21,540

1102
00:49:24,946 --> 00:49:26,579
>> LOOK, COLIN.

1103
00:49:26,581 --> 00:49:27,847
THESE ARE TWO GREAT TEAMS.

1104
00:49:27,849 --> 00:49:29,248
AND THERE'S NO DOUBT IT WILL BE

1105
00:49:29,250 --> 00:49:29,882
BACK AND FORTH ALL NIGHT.

1106
00:49:29,884 --> 00:49:32,284
>> 100%.

1107
00:49:32,286 --> 00:49:34,553
I PREDICT THAT THE PATRIOTS WILL

1108
00:49:34,555 --> 00:49:36,756
BE ON TOP FOR THE FIRST HALF.

1109
00:49:36,758 --> 00:49:39,859
THEN AT SOME POINT, THE SEAHAWKS

1110
00:49:39,861 --> 00:49:40,559
WILL COME FROM BEHIND AND --

1111
00:49:44,966 --> 00:49:45,631
DOMINATE THE PATRIOTS FOR A

1112
00:49:45,633 --> 00:49:48,567
LITTLE WHILE.

1113
00:49:48,569 --> 00:49:50,002
>> YEAH.

1114
00:49:50,004 --> 00:49:52,605
THEN MAYBE THE PATRIOTS GET

1115
00:49:52,607 --> 00:49:54,373
TIRED AND ASK THE SEAHAWKS TO

1116
00:49:54,375 --> 00:49:55,074
PLAY THEMSELVES FOR A LITTLE

1117
00:49:55,076 --> 00:49:55,374
WHILE.

1118
00:50:01,649 --> 00:50:02,581
OR THE PATRIOTS GO WATCH ON THE

1119
00:50:02,583 --> 00:50:02,948
SIDELINES.

1120
00:50:04,585 --> 00:50:05,251
>> OKAY, WHAT ARE YOU GUYS

1121
00:50:05,253 --> 00:50:05,684
TALKING ABOUT?

1122
00:50:08,356 --> 00:50:09,588

BOWL, COLIN.

1124
00:50:10,558 --> 00:50:11,924
IT'S THE BIGGEST GAME OF THE

1125
00:50:11,926 --> 00:50:12,224
YEAR.

1126
00:50:12,226 --> 00:50:13,292
SO YOU KNOW, WHATEVER HAPPENS,

1127
00:50:13,294 --> 00:50:14,026
ALL I KNOW IS -- SOMEONE'S

1128
00:50:14,028 --> 00:50:21,967
GETTING A RING.

1129
00:50:21,969 --> 00:50:23,536
>> YOU THINK THAT SOMEONE WILL

1130
00:50:23,538 --> 00:50:23,936
GET A RING?

1131
00:50:23,938 --> 00:50:26,972
>> OH, WOW.

1132
00:50:26,974 --> 00:50:27,673
WELL, PROBABLY NOT LIKE THAT

1133
00:50:27,675 --> 00:50:29,542
NIGHT.

1134
00:50:29,544 --> 00:50:32,011
>> I DIDN'T SAY THAT NIGHT.

1135
00:50:32,013 --> 00:50:33,579
>> LOOK, I THINK THE PATRIOTS

1136
00:50:33,581 --> 00:50:34,280
JUST THOUGHT THIS WAS, LIKE,

1137
00:50:34,282 --> 00:50:34,580
CHILL.

1138
00:50:36,150 --> 00:50:37,550
>> OH, OH, OKAY.

1139
00:50:37,552 --> 00:50:38,818
OH, THE PATRIOTS THOUGHT IT WAS

1140
00:50:38,820 --> 00:50:39,552
SUPER CHILL.

1141
00:50:39,554 --> 00:50:41,187
THEY THOUGHT THE SUPER BOWL WAS

1142
00:50:41,189 --> 00:50:44,056
CHILL, OKAY.

1143
00:50:44,058 --> 00:50:44,356
WELL.

1144
00:50:44,358 --> 00:50:46,826
I THINK IF THE SEAHAWKS KNEW

1145
00:50:46,828 --> 00:50:48,527
THAT, THEY WOULDN'T HAVE DONE

1146
00:50:48,529 --> 00:50:49,995
THE TUSH PUSH IN COLIN'S

1147

DRESSING ROOM.

1148
00:50:50,465 --> 00:50:52,364
>> MY DRESSING ROOM AGAIN?

1149
00:50:52,366 --> 00:50:53,933
>> THE TUSH PUSH?

1150
00:50:53,935 --> 00:50:55,935
IF I RECALL, THE SEAHAWKS CALLED

1151
00:50:55,937 --> 00:50:56,435
THAT PLAY.

1152
00:50:56,437 --> 00:50:57,870
THE PATRIOTS WERE ACTUALLY

1153
00:50:57,872 --> 00:50:59,205
SCARED TO DO IT BECAUSE THEY'D

1154
00:50:59,207 --> 00:50:59,839
