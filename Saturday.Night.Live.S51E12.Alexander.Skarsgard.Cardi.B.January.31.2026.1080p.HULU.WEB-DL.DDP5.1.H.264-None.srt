1
00:00:00,436 --> 00:00:03,574
>>> IN RESPONSE TO THE CHAOTIC
SITUATION IN MINNESOTA,

2
00:00:03,574 --> 00:00:06,287
PRESIDENT TRUMP ORDERED WHITE
HOUSE BORDER CZAR TOM HOMAN

3
00:00:06,287 --> 00:00:09,011
TO
TRAVEL TO MINNEAPOLIS AND TAKE
CONTROL OF THE OPERATION.

4
00:00:09,011 --> 00:00:11,315
UPON ARRIVAL, HE MET WITH I.C.E.
UNIT COMMANDERS

5
00:00:11,315 --> 00:00:13,719
TO CLARIFY THE
MISSION OBJECTIVES.

6
00:00:13,719 --> 00:00:16,655
>> ALL RIGHT, EVERYONE.

7
00:00:16,655 --> 00:00:21,257
ALL RIGHT.
THANK YOU.
ALL RIGHT.

8
00:00:21,257 --> 00:00:23,665
ALL RIGHT, EVERYONE, SETTLE
DOWN.

9
00:00:23,665 --> 00:00:25,121
MY NAME IS TOM HOMAN.

10
00:00:25,121 --> 00:00:29,742
NOW I'M SURE A LOT OF YOU ARE
WONDERING WHY GREG BOVINO, THE
LAST GUY, WAS DISMISSED.

11
00:00:29,742 --> 00:00:33,166
I WANT TO STRESS THAT IT WASN'T
BECAUSE HE DID A BAD JOB.

12
00:00:33,166 --> 00:00:36,209
OR PUBLICLY LIED ABOUT THE
SHOOTING OF AN AMERICAN CITIZEN.

13
00:00:36,309 --> 00:00:39,653
OR EVEN, OH-OH, DRESSED LIKE A
NAZI.

14
00:00:39,653 --> 00:00:44,270
IT WAS THAT HE WAS FILMED DOING
THESE THINGS.

15
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:46,762
AND THE PRESIDENT NO LIKEE THAT.

16
00:00:46,762 --> 00:00:49,407
SO I'M HERE NOW, AND WE NEED TO
TIGHTEN UP.

17
00:00:49,407 --> 00:00:51,928
THAT STARTS WITH REMEMBERING THE
MISSION OBJECTIVE.

18
00:00:52,013 --> 00:00:55,338
NOW, WHO CAN TELL ME WHY WE'RE
HERE IN MINNEAPOLIS?

19
00:00:55,338 --> 00:00:57,025
>> PASS.

20
00:00:57,025 --> 00:00:59,679
>> NOPE, CAN'T PASS.

21
00:00:59,751 --> 00:01:02,098
COME ON, GUYS.
WHAT ARE WE DOING IN
MINNEAPOLIS?

22
00:01:02,098 --> 00:01:05,722
>> THIS COULD BE WRONG, BUT
ARMY?

23
00:01:05,722 --> 00:01:08,248
>> CLOSE.
THAT'S CLOSE.

24
00:01:08,248 --> 00:01:12,856
WE'RE HERE TO DETAIN AND DEPORT
ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS WHO HAVE
COMMITTED CRIMES.

25
00:01:12,856 --> 00:01:16,621
>> THAT IS LITERALLY THE FIRST
I'M HEARING OF THAT.

26
00:01:16,621 --> 00:01:18,705
>> WELL, IT SHOULDN'T BE.

27
00:01:18,705 --> 00:01:22,048
JUST SO I KNOW WHAT WERE YOU
TOLD YOU SHOULD BE DOING?

28
00:01:22,048 --> 00:01:24,811
>> UM -- WILDING OUT.

29
00:01:24,811 --> 00:01:27,991
>> FORGET EVERYTHING YOU WERE
TOLD BEFORE.

30
00:01:27,991 --> 00:01:32,513
WE'RE NOT HERE TO INTIMIDATE,
RACIALLY PROFILE, OR VIOLATE
ANYONE'S RIGHTS.

31
00:01:32,513 --> 00:01:35,297
SO AGAIN, WHAT ARE WE LOOKING
FOR?

32
00:01:35,297 --> 00:01:37,417
>> EPSTEIN FILES?

33
00:01:37,417 --> 00:01:39,619
>> NOPE!
NOPE!

34
00:01:39,619 --> 00:01:43,087
WE ACTUALLY JUST RELEASED THOSE
TO DISTRACT FROM THIS.

35
00:01:43,087 --> 00:01:46,997
WHICH IS IRONIC, BECAUSE WE DID
THIS TO DISTRACT FROM THOSE, SO...

36
00:01:46,997 --> 00:01:50,671
ANYWAY, GUYS.
IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT DOING THE MISSION,

37
00:01:50,671 --> 00:01:52,467
IT'S ABOUT DOING IT THE
RIGHT WAY.

38
00:01:52,467 --> 00:01:57,179
A LOT OF THE BAD PRESS WE'RE
GETTING IS COMING FROM THE
AGGRESSIVE TACTICS WE'RE USING.

39
00:01:57,179 --> 00:01:59,128
>> AND THE NAZI COAT.

40
00:01:59,128 --> 00:02:02,724
>> YES, THE NAZI COAT, VERY
GOOD.

41
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:08,538
SO, LET'S TALK ABOUT USE OF
FORCE.

42
00:02:08,538 --> 00:02:10,364
WHEN DO WE WANT TO USE FORCE?

43
00:02:10,364 --> 00:02:12,061
>> RIGHT AWAY?

44
00:02:12,061 --> 00:02:15,021
>> NO.
THINK OF THE OPPOSITE.

45
00:02:15,021 --> 00:02:17,678
>> RIGHT.
PRE-EMPTIVELY.

46
00:02:17,678 --> 00:02:21,323
>> ALSO NO.
IT'S KIND OF A TRICK QUESTION,

47
00:02:21,323 --> 00:02:23,740
BECAUSE WE ACTUALLY DON'T WANT
TO USE FORCE.

48
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:28,844
REMEMBER, THE JOB ULTIMATELY IS
ABOUT KEEPING AMERICA SAFE
FROM -- WHAT?

49
00:02:28,844 --> 00:02:32,406
>> THIS COULD BE WRONG, BUT --
DON LEMON?

50
00:02:32,406 --> 00:02:35,665
>> THAT IS WRONG, YES.

51
00:02:35,665 --> 00:02:37,480
IT'S CRIMINALS.

52
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:39,418
>> TEACHER?

53
00:02:39,418 --> 00:02:42,642
>> NOT A TEACHER.
GO AHEAD.

54
00:02:42,642 --> 00:02:46,537
>> UM -- SOME OF THESE PEOPLE
PROTESTING HAVE GUNS.

55
00:02:46,537 --> 00:02:48,914
THAT SHOULDN'T BE ALLOWED,
RIGHT?

56
00:02:48,914 --> 00:02:51,046
>> WELL, LET'S FLIP IT AROUND,
RIGHT?

57
00:02:51,046 --> 00:02:54,080
HOW MANY OF YOU WENT TO A "STOP
THE STEAL" PROTEST

58
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,926
WITH A LOADED
AUTOMATIC WEAPON?

59
00:02:59,243 --> 00:03:01,706
OKAY.
THAT IS ALL OF YOU.

60
00:03:01,706 --> 00:03:02,991
SO YOU'VE GOT TO DO BETTER.

61
00:03:02,991 --> 00:03:05,674
LOOK, I'M TOM HOMAN, OKAY?

62
00:03:05,674 --> 00:03:10,681
I'M THE -- I'M THE SEPARATING
FAMILIES AT THE BORDER GUY.

63
00:03:10,681 --> 00:03:14,747
I'M THE ON-FILM TAKING A $50,000
BRIBE GUY.

64
00:03:14,747 --> 00:03:19,233
AND Y'ALL ARE MAKING ME LOOK
LIKE THE UPSTANDING, REASONABLE
ADULT IN THE ROOM.
THAT'S CRAZY!

65
00:03:19,233 --> 00:03:21,994
NOW, LET'S OPEN IT UP TO
QUESTIONS, PLEASE.
YES?

66
00:03:22,096 --> 00:03:24,639
>> I HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT THE
LOCAL POLICE.

67
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:29,026
>> THAT'S GREAT.
I WAS HOPING SOMEONE WOULD BRING
THIS UP, BECAUSE THERE'S BEEN
SOME FRICTION THERE.

68
00:03:29,026 --> 00:03:31,295
WHAT'S YOUR QUESTION ABOUT THE
LOCAL POLICE?

69
00:03:31,295 --> 00:03:35,636
>> UM -- HOW COME I WASN'T
ALLOWED TO BE IN THEM?

70
00:03:35,636 --> 00:03:38,322
>> I'M NOT SURE.

71
00:03:38,322 --> 00:03:39,934
YES, YES, YOU.

72
00:03:39,934 --> 00:03:43,588
>> UH, YES.
SO -- I HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT
DESTROYING EVIDENCE.

73
00:03:43,588 --> 00:03:45,228
>> YEAH, LET ME STOP YOU RIGHT
THERE.

74
00:03:45,228 --> 00:03:48,518
YOU SHOULD NEVER, NEVER DESTROY
EVIDENCE.

75
00:03:48,518 --> 00:03:50,833
>> GOT IT.

76
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:55,310
>> DON'T WINK.
DON'T WINK.

77
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:58,425
NOW, WHO ELSE HAS A QUESTION?
YES, YOU?

78
00:03:58,425 --> 00:04:02,224
>> YEAH, HOW COME ALL THE FAST
FOOD IN THIS CITY TASTES LIKE
SPIT?

79
00:04:02,224 --> 00:04:05,150
>> IT'S JUST BEST NOT TO THINK
ABOUT THAT.

80
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:07,801
OKAY.
WE GOT ONE MORE QUESTION.

81
00:04:07,801 --> 00:04:10,953
>> I'M BEING DETAILED TO THE
SUPER BOWL,

82
00:04:10,953 --> 00:04:14,293
BUT I'M LOOKING IN
MY TICKET APP AND I DON'T SEE A
TICKET.

83
00:04:14,293 --> 00:04:18,092
>> RIGHT.
SO YOU WON'T ACTUALLY HAVE A
SEAT.

84
00:04:18,092 --> 00:04:22,922
>> SO WE'RE PLAYING IN IT?
LIKE WHAT?

85
00:04:22,922 --> 00:04:25,459
>> GUYS.
GUYS, NO.
NO.

86
00:04:25,459 --> 00:04:29,325
LET'S RECAP.
WHAT HAVE WE LEARNED TODAY?

87
00:04:29,325 --> 00:04:31,374
>> THIS COULD BE WRONG, BUT --

88
00:04:31,374 --> 00:04:34,128
THAT YOU HIRED A BUNCH OF ANGRY,
AGGRESSIVE GUYS,

89
00:04:34,128 --> 00:04:38,058
GAVE US GUNS,
DIDN'T TRAIN US, SO THIS IS WHAT
YOU WANTED TO HAPPEN?

90
00:04:38,058 --> 00:04:42,010
>> COME ON, MAN, DON'T START
THINKING NOW.

91
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:44,841
DROP AND GIVE ME 20.

92
00:04:44,841 --> 00:04:48,701
>> HOW ABOUT THREE WITH KNEES
GIRL-STYLE?

93
00:04:48,701 --> 00:04:50,669
>> NEVER MIND.
LOOK.

94
00:04:50,669 --> 00:04:55,113
THE SITUATION OUT THERE HAS BEEN
ROUGH, AND WE NEED TO LOWER THE
TEMPERATURE.

95
00:04:55,113 --> 00:04:58,354
SO LET'S GET OUT THERE, LET'S
SHOW SOME RESTRAINT.

96
00:04:58,354 --> 00:05:02,485
LET'S DO OUR JOB WITHOUT
VIOLATING ANYONE'S RIGHTS AS
AMERICANS.

97
00:05:02,485 --> 00:05:05,455
CAN YOU DO THAT?
>> NO.

98
00:05:05,455 --> 00:05:08,949
>> WELL, I HAD TO ASK.
MAYBE JUST TRY NOT TO GET
FILMED.

99
00:05:08,949 --> 00:05:13,414
AND LIVE FROM NEW YORK, IT'S
SATURDAY NIGHT!

100
00:07:11,442 --> 00:07:16,085
MUSICAL

HOST
SKARSGARD!

102
00:07:23,242 --> 00:07:28,855
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN --
ALEXANDER SKARSGARD!

103
00:07:47,971 --> 00:07:50,581
>> THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK

104
00:07:50,581 --> 00:07:53,461
I AM INCREDIBLY EXCITED TO BE
HERE TONIGHT,

105
00:07:53,461 --> 00:07:59,275
BECAUSE WE ARE

SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE!

106
00:08:01,993 --> 00:08:06,719
¶ CELEBRATE GOOD TIMES COME ON ¶

107
00:08:10,456 --> 00:08:13,315
NOW, WHEN I WAS A KID, I LOVED
WATCHING THIS SHOW

108
00:08:13,315 --> 00:08:15,940
FROM MY IGLOO
BACK IN STOCKHOLM.

109
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:19,440
BUT DURING THESE MONOLOGUES, I
WOULD NEVER FOCUS ON THE HOST.

110
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:22,309
I WAS MORE INTERESTED IN THE
BAND.

111
00:08:22,309 --> 00:08:24,067
BACK THERE IN THE BACKGROUND.

112
00:08:24,067 --> 00:08:26,933
SOMETIMES LAUGHING.
MORE OFTEN NOT.

113
00:08:26,933 --> 00:08:31,443
BUT ALWAYS OUT OF FOCUS.
NEVER IN THE SPOTLIGHT.

114
00:08:31,443 --> 00:08:33,485
WELL, NOT ON MY WATCH.

115
00:08:33,485 --> 00:08:36,432
CALL ME WILLY WONKA, BECAUSE
TONIGHT,

116
00:08:36,432 --> 00:08:39,493
I'M GOING TO LET THE
LITTLE PEOPLE COOK.

117
00:08:40,433 --> 00:08:43,245
GUYS, GIVE ME SOMETHING.

118
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,620
SEE, I LIKE THAT ONE.

119
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:48,959
NICE RIGHT THERE.

120
00:08:49,608 --> 00:08:51,838
COME

121
00:08:54,612 --> 00:08:57,249
WHAT IS YOUR NAME, GOOD SIR?
>> JAMES.

122
00:08:57,249 --> 00:08:59,603

HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN IN THE
BAND?

123
00:08:59,603 --> 00:09:03,955
>> 26 YEARS, BUT

124
00:09:03,955 --> 00:09:08,544
HOW ABOUT YOU, IS SIR?
MUST BE PRETTY COOL TO TALK TO
THE HOST, HUH?

125
00:09:08,544 --> 00:09:11,743
>> DEPENDS ON THE HOST.
>> YOU ARE WELCOME.

126
00:09:12,291 --> 00:09:17,814
A FEMALE.
ON GUITAR.

127
00:09:18,658 --> 00:09:23,848
YBANEZ 2000, NO?
>> NO.

128
00:09:23,848 --> 00:09:25,387
>> NO?
THAT'S WHAT I SAID NO.

129
00:09:25,491 --> 00:09:27,634
GREAT BANTER, GUYS.

130
00:09:28,307 --> 00:09:34,207
HEY -- WHO WANTS TO HEAR SOME
FREEFORM JAZZ?

131
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:37,534
THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT.
SHOW ME WHAT YOU GOT.

132
00:09:39,776 --> 00:09:44,317
WHAT HAVE WE GOT HERE?
A LITTLE STRAY SAXOPHONE.

133
00:09:44,317 --> 00:09:47,401
ALWAYS WANTED TO PLAY ONE OF
THOSE.

134
00:09:54,031 --> 00:09:57,949
THAT WAS EASY.
NO, NO, DON'T FOLLOW ME.

135
00:09:57,949 --> 00:10:01,781
FOCUS ON THE LADIES.

136
00:10:10,344 --> 00:10:12,927
POWER

137
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:17,493
LAGGING

138
00:10:49,924 --> 00:10:53,308
IT FEELS GOOD TO GIVE!

139
00:10:53,308 --> 00:10:56,581
GIVE IT UP FOR THE BAND FOR
REALS.

140
00:10:59,297 --> 00:11:03,349
WE HAVE A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU.
CARDI B IS HERE.

141
00:11:04,027 --> 00:11:06,901
STICK AROUND, WE'LL BE RIGHT
BACK!

142
00:11:36,388 --> 00:11:40,438
THANKS
MOM AND DAD.

143
00:11:40,438 --> 00:11:42,083
>> OF COURSE.

144
00:11:42,083 --> 00:11:44,584
>> WE LOVE YOU, WE LOVE YOU.

145
00:11:44,584 --> 00:11:48,610
>> SHOULD WE HEAD TO THE
RESTAURANT?
I'M STARVING.

146
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:49,965
>> OH, YEAH.
>> SURE.

147
00:11:50,047 --> 00:11:53,513
>> OH, OH -- WAIT.
WAIT, THERE'S --

148
00:11:53,623 --> 00:11:56,552
THERE'S
SOMETHING I NEED TO TELL YOU ALL
FIRST.

149
00:11:56,552 --> 00:11:59,973
>> OH, OKAY, WHAT IS IT, MOM?
>> IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

150
00:11:59,973 --> 00:12:04,310
>> I'M ONLY GOING TO SAY IT IF,
AFTER I DO,

151
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:07,862
YOU PROMISE YOU WILL
NOT REACT.

152
00:12:07,862 --> 00:12:12,011
NO TALKING.
NO FACES.

153
00:12:12,011 --> 00:12:14,265
NO NOTHING.

154
00:12:14,265 --> 00:12:18,596
>> MOM, WHAT IS GOING ON?
>> YEAH, YOU'RE SCARING US.

155
00:12:18,596 --> 00:12:23,968
>> THE THING I'M GOING TO SAY --
IS SHOCKING.

156
00:12:23,968 --> 00:12:27,300
AND IT'S GOING TO MAKE YOU WANT
TO REACT.

157
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:31,492
BUT I NEED YOU TO PROMISE THAT
YOU WILL NOT.

158
00:12:31,492 --> 00:12:33,479
>> FINE.
>> SURE, YEAH.

159
00:12:33,479 --> 00:12:34,924
>> LET'S DO A PRACTICE EXAMPLE.

160
00:12:34,924 --> 00:12:39,109
I EAT BUGS.
I EAT BUGS.

161
00:12:40,087 --> 00:12:41,664
>> MOM.
IS THAT --

162
00:12:41,664 --> 00:12:44,600
>> NO, NO, WHAT DID I SAY?
>> SORRY, SORRY.

163
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,514
>> NO SPEAKING.

164
00:12:46,514 --> 00:12:49,496
NO TALKING.
NO NOTHING.

165
00:12:49,496 --> 00:12:51,238
PRACTICE EXAMPLE.

166
00:12:51,238 --> 00:12:53,044
MY BUTT FELL OFF, I CAN'T FIND
IT.

167
00:12:53,044 --> 00:12:55,641
I DON'T HAVE A BUTT.

168
00:12:58,657 --> 00:13:01,062
OKAY, GOOD.

169
00:13:01,456 --> 00:13:04,348
WHAT I HAVE TO TELL YOU --

170
00:13:05,029 --> 00:13:09,329
IS I MAY HAVE CHANGED MY MIND --

171
00:13:10,372 --> 00:13:13,426
ABOUT TRUMP.

172
00:13:14,782 --> 00:13:18,071
>> WHAT?
>> YEAH!

173
00:13:18,071 --> 00:13:22,114
>> STOP IT, STOP IT!
YOU WANT THIS TO BE REAL OR NOT?

174
00:13:22,114 --> 00:13:25,227
>> YES!
>> SURE, YEAH.

175
00:13:28,012 --> 00:13:31,597
>> I FEEL NOW --

176
00:13:31,597 --> 00:13:35,263
LIKE HE MIGHT BE --

177
00:13:35,788 --> 00:13:38,275
BAD FOR OUR COUNTRY.

178
00:13:38,275 --> 00:13:40,068
>> OH, I DO!
>> STOP IT!

179
00:13:40,068 --> 00:13:43,813
WHAT DID I SAY, WHAT DID I SAY?

180
00:13:44,007 --> 00:13:47,342
>> I'M SORRY, MOM, YOU'VE GOT TO
BE JOKING.

181
00:13:47,342 --> 00:13:49,509
>> WE'VE BEEN SAYING THIS SINCE
2016.

182
00:13:49,509 --> 00:13:51,837
>> OH, I'M SORRY I'M LATE TO THE
PERFECT PARTY.

183
00:13:51,837 --> 00:13:54,401
DO YOU GUYS WANT THIS TO BE REAL
OR NOT?

184
00:13:54,401 --> 00:13:55,754
>> YES!
>> YES, ABSOLUTE.

185
00:13:55,754 --> 00:14:00,288
>> WE WANT IT TO BE REAL.
>> THEN GIVE ME GRACE.

186
00:14:04,465 --> 00:14:10,435
I FEEL LIKE -- MAYBE --

187
00:14:10,435 --> 00:14:13,808
SOME OF THE THINGS HE SAYS --

188
00:14:13,808 --> 00:14:16,175
AREN'T TRUE.

189
00:14:16,175 --> 00:14:18,054
>> OH!
>> MOM!

190
00:14:18,194 --> 00:14:21,795
>> BYE, I TAKE IT BACK!

191
00:14:21,795 --> 00:14:24,606
>> MOM, COME ON.
DON'T DO THAT.

192
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:28,241
>> GUYS, COME ON, CAN'T YOU SEE
THIS IS HARD FOR YOUR MOTHER?

193
00:14:28,241 --> 00:14:33,984
ALSO, I WANT TO REMIND
EVERYBODY, IT IS MY BIRTHDAY.

194
00:14:33,984 --> 00:14:35,732
>> AND GREG, WE ARE GOING TO GET
TO THAT.

195
00:14:35,732 --> 00:14:37,926
AND FOR THE RECORD, YOU LITTLE BRATS,

196
00:14:37,926 --> 00:14:40,493
I DO STILL THINK HE'S A
GOOD BUSINESSMAN.

197
00:14:40,493 --> 00:14:42,819
>> MOM, COME ON.

198
00:14:42,819 --> 00:14:45,640
>> THIS IS WHY NOBODY LIKES YOUR
SIDE!

199
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:47,304
YOU THINK YOU KNOW EVERYTHING

200
00:14:47,304 --> 00:14:50,656
WITH YOUR MACHO RAPPING HAMILTON
AND YOUR IUDs.

201
00:14:50,656 --> 00:14:53,302
JUST HAVE KIDS ALREADY!

202
00:14:53,302 --> 00:14:55,733
>> WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

203
00:14:55,733 --> 00:14:58,857
>> MAYBE WE COULD TALK ABOUT
THIS AT RED ROBIN'S.

204
00:14:58,857 --> 00:15:03,367
I'M AFRAID THEY'RE GOING TO GIVE
OUR TABLE AWAY, AND I WANT MY
BIRTHDAY SCOOP.

205
00:15:03,367 --> 00:15:07,796
>> OKAY, MOM, WE'RE SORRY, WE'LL
BE QUIET.
JUST SAY WHAT YOU NEED TO SAY.

206
00:15:07,796 --> 00:15:12,615
>> FINE.
BUT I SWEAR TO GOD --

207
00:15:12,615 --> 00:15:15,430
IF I HEAR A SINGLE "I TOLD YOU SO,"

208
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:19,091
I WILL GO SEE THE "MELANIA"
MOVIE TONIGHT.

209
00:15:19,091 --> 00:15:20,792
YOU HEAR ME?

210
00:15:20,886 --> 00:15:24,187
>> OKAY.
>> REALLY

211
00:15:24,187 --> 00:15:27,028
>> THEN I WILL SPEAK.

212
00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:32,753
THE THINGS THAT ARE HAPPENING --

213
00:15:32,753 --> 00:15:36,958
NO ONE COULD HAVE SEEN COMING.

214
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:47,060
I FEEL LIKE -- THE WAY THEY TALK
ABOUT GUNS --

215
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:52,405
IS DIFFERENT --
FOR DIFFERENT PEOPLE.

216
00:15:56,995 --> 00:15:59,915
THEY MADE ME FEEL WORRIED --

217
00:15:59,915 --> 00:16:02,448
ABOUT TRANS PEOPLE.

218
00:16:02,448 --> 00:16:05,174
BUT NOW I'M REALIZING --

219
00:16:05,174 --> 00:16:09,509
I DON'T REALLY GET WHAT THE PROBLEM IS.

220
00:16:13,172 --> 00:16:16,191
I'M STARTING TO WONDER --

221
00:16:16,191 --> 00:16:21,877
IF DRAG QUEENS -- ARE ACTUALLY
HILARIOUS.

222
00:16:22,599 --> 00:16:25,425
OH, STOP THAT, I SEE WHAT YOU'RE
DOING!
STOP IT!

223
00:16:25,425 --> 00:16:28,270
>> ENOUGH, ENOUGH, LEAVE YOUR
MOTHER ALONE.

224
00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:32,927
HER LAPTOP IS OLD, SHE GETS A
DIFFERENT INTERNET THAN YOU.

225
00:16:32,927 --> 00:16:34,672
>> NOT HOW THAT WORKS.

226
00:16:34,672 --> 00:16:38,334
>> THAT IS HOW THAT WORKS, AND
THIS IS VULNERABLE FOR ME, OKAY?

227
00:16:38,334 --> 00:16:40,941
YOU SHOULD UNDERSTAND.
WHAT DID I SAY WHEN YOU CAME
OUT?

228
00:16:40,941 --> 00:16:44,994
>> YOU SAID, IS IT POSSIBLE YOU
JUST LIKE HATS?

229
00:16:44,994 --> 00:16:47,833
>> STILL WAITING ON THE ANSWER,
BABE.

230
00:16:47,833 --> 00:16:50,560
>> PLEASE STOP GETTING YOUR
MOTHER WORKED UP.

231
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:53,411
OR SHE WON'T DANCE FOR ME
TONIGHT.

232
00:16:53,411 --> 00:16:57,163
DANCE
>> YOU WOULDN'T BE HERE WITHOUT
IT.

233
00:16:57,163 --> 00:16:59,604
>> OKAY, RELAX.

234
00:16:59,604 --> 00:17:02,723
MOM, WE'RE SORRY.
YOU'RE RIGHT.

235
00:17:02,723 --> 00:17:05,930
WE SHOULDN'T HAVE MADE THIS HARD
FOR YOU, AND WE'RE HAPPY THAT
YOU TOLD US.

236
00:17:05,930 --> 00:17:08,757
>> YEAH.
>> WE'RE SORRY.
>> THANKS, MOM.

237
00:17:08,757 --> 00:17:12,480
>> ALL RIGHT.
LET'S GET TO DINNER.

238
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,554
PLENTY OF ROOM IN THE
CYBERTRUCK.

239
00:17:14,554 --> 00:17:17,792
>> SELL THAT!
>> ARE YOU KIDDING?

240
00:17:22,546 --> 00:17:25,294
>>> THE WINTER OLYMPICS ARE A
WEEK AWAY.

241
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:29,884
NOW MEET SOME OF THE ATHLETES
WHO PUSHED THEMSELVES TO THE
LIMIT OF HUMAN ENDURANCE

242
00:17:29,961 --> 00:17:33,289
FOR THE
CHANCE TO COMPETE AT THE GAMES
IN MILAN.

243
00:17:33,289 --> 00:17:35,222
>> NO ONE SAID IT WOULD BE EASY,

244
00:17:35,222 --> 00:17:38,191
BUT IT'S ALL WORTH IT WHEN I'M
OUT ON THE SLOPES WITH MY BOARD.

245
00:17:38,191 --> 00:17:40,814
>> WHEN I'M ON THE ICE, I FEEL
ALIVE.

246
00:17:40,814 --> 00:17:42,720
IT'S MY PURPOSE.

247
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:46,501
>> I HATE THE LUGE.
IT'S WAY TOO FAST.

248
00:17:46,501 --> 00:17:49,996
IT SCARES ME TO DEATH AND I
SERIOUSLY HATE IT.

249
00:17:49,997 --> 00:17:52,516
SPORTS

250
00:17:52,516 --> 00:17:56,097
>> I'VE BEEN WANTING THIS MY
WHOLE LIFE.
I'M LIVING MY DREAM.

251
00:17:56,097 --> 00:17:59,015
>> THIS IS A NIGHTMARE.
I HATE THE THING I'M GOOD AT.

252
00:17:59,015 --> 00:18:01,044
>> OVER 2,000 ATHLETES.

253
00:18:01,044 --> 00:18:04,313
BUT ONLY THE BEST OF THE BEST
WILL BRING HOME THE GOLD.

254
00:18:04,313 --> 00:18:07,089
>> I'VE TRAINED FOR THIS SINCE I
WAS 4 YEARS OLD.

255
00:18:07,089 --> 00:18:09,530
>> YOU'VE JUST GOT TO WANT IT.
NO ONE'S BORN THE BEST.

256
00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:13,979
>> IN LUGE, BEING THE BEST IS
SORT OF JUST THE HEIGHT AND
WEIGHT DISTRIBUTION THING.

257
00:18:13,979 --> 00:18:17,359
I HONESTLY THINK A CORPSE THAT'S
MY SAME SHAPE COULD WIN.

258
00:18:17,359 --> 00:18:20,062
>> EVERY ATHLETE BRINGS
SOMETHING DIFFERENT TO THE
TABLE.

259
00:18:20,062 --> 00:18:22,487
>> WHAT MAKES ME UNIQUE?
DEFINITELY MY SLOPE STYLE.

260
00:18:22,488 --> 00:18:24,406
CLEAN

261
00:18:24,406 --> 00:18:28,110
>> MY SIGNATURE MOVE IS
DEFINITELY MY ENGLISH TRIPLE
AXEL.

262
00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:30,873
>> I JUST GO STRAIGHT DOWN LIKE
EVERYONE.

263
00:18:30,873 --> 00:18:34,064
BUT I SCREAM THE WHOLE TIME.

264
00:18:38,634 --> 00:18:42,221
>> AND BEHIND EVERY OLYMPIAN IS
AN EQUALLY DEDICATED COACH.

265
00:18:42,221 --> 00:18:45,153
>> COACHING CLARE HAS BEEN ONE
OF THE GREATEST GIFTS OF MY
LIFE.

266
00:18:45,153 --> 00:18:48,886
>> COACHING GARDI IS A BATTLE.

267
00:18:48,886 --> 00:18:52,848
TRYING TO GET HER ON THE SLED,
GET HER DOWN THE HILL.

268
00:18:52,848 --> 00:18:56,803
GET HER TO STOP FREAKING OUT AND
PRETENDING TO BE SICK, ET
CETERA?

269
00:18:56,803 --> 00:18:58,190
>> I'M SICK!
>> YOU'RE NOT SICK.

270
00:18:58,190 --> 00:19:01,016
>> I'M SICK!
>> GO DOWN, GO DOWN.

271
00:19:01,016 --> 00:19:03,710
OH, LOOK AT THAT SPIDER!

272
00:19:05,066 --> 00:19:09,088
>> THE SPORT NEEDS HER.
SHE'S A ONCE-IN-A-GENERATION

273
00:19:09,088 --> 00:19:10,378
SHAPE.

274
00:19:10,378 --> 00:19:14,323
>> THEY'RE NOT JUST PLAYING FOR
THEMSELVES.
THEY'RE PLAYING FOR US ALL.

275
00:19:14,323 --> 00:19:16,057
>> I'M DOING THIS FOR YOU, MOM.

276
00:19:16,057 --> 00:19:18,258
>> I'M SO PROUD OF MY LITTLE
GIRL.

277
00:19:18,258 --> 00:19:22,150
I'VE BEEN CHEERING HER ON SINCE
SHE WON HER VERY FIRST EVENT.

278
00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:26,095
>> AFTER YEARS OF PREPARATION,
IT'S GO TIME FOR THE ATHLETES.

279
00:19:26,095 --> 00:19:28,600
>> I'M LOCKED IN.
NO DISTRACTIONS.

280
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:31,911
>> FOR COMPETITION, THE NAME OF
THE GAME IS FOCUS.

281
00:19:31,911 --> 00:19:34,010
>> THE NAME OF THE GAME IS TO CONFUSE

282
00:19:34,010 --> 00:19:36,497
AND ULTIMATELY SILENCE
MY SURVIVAL INSTINCTS.

283
00:19:36,497 --> 00:19:39,129
>> SEE IF THEY HAVE WHAT IT
TAKES TO WIN.

284
00:19:39,129 --> 00:19:41,646
>> WE'LL SEE YOU IN MILAN!

285
00:19:41,646 --> 00:19:44,392
>> NOT ME, THOUGH, BECAUSE I'M
SICK, I CAN'T GO.

286
00:19:44,392 --> 00:19:46,400
CAN

287
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,776
>> THE WINTER OLYMPICS IN MILAN.

288
00:19:48,776 --> 00:19:51,060
GO FOR THE GOLD.

289
00:19:56,593 --> 00:20:00,829
>>> ALL RIGHT, EVERYONE.
I AM THRILLED TO BE BACK IN OSLO,

290
00:20:00,829 --> 00:20:04,723
TO BE DIRECTING THIS
MOVIE, "STENCH OF A FAMILY."

291
00:20:04,723 --> 00:20:07,988
I AM OBSESSED WITH SCANDINAVIAN
CINEMA.

292
00:20:07,988 --> 00:20:11,262
I JUST LOVE HOW YOU GUYS SO
BRAVELY REFLECT

293
00:20:11,262 --> 00:20:14,254
HOW FAMILY LIFE
IS JUST HARROWING.

294
00:20:14,254 --> 00:20:17,085
SO LET'S GO FOR A TAKE, YEAH?
ALL RIGHT.

295
00:20:17,085 --> 00:20:21,168
>> "STENCH OF A FAMILY," SCENE

00:20:25,212 --> 00:20:27,718
>> LOOK AT ME WITH THIS.

298
00:20:27,718 --> 00:20:30,135
>> FATHER IS DYING UPSTAIRS,

299
00:20:30,135 --> 00:20:33,616
AND YOU DO NOT HAVE THE NERVE TO SEE
HIM?

300
00:20:33,808 --> 00:20:36,618
>> HE WAS A PIG AND A COWARD.

301
00:20:36,618 --> 00:20:39,130
>> BUT I HAVE TO BATHE HIM, NOT
YOU.

302
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:41,982
I'VE BEEN HERE FOR SIX YEARS
BATHING HIM.

303
00:20:41,982 --> 00:20:46,552
I USED TO PAINT.
BUT NOW I JUST WIPE.

304
00:20:46,552 --> 00:20:49,554
WIPE MY FATHER.

305
00:20:49,554 --> 00:20:54,107
>> YOU CAN LEAVE AT ANY TIME.
YOU JUST WANT TO COMPLERN.

306
00:20:54,107 --> 00:20:56,118
>> AND CUT!

307
00:20:56,118 --> 00:20:59,636
>> OH, MY GOD, I DID SAY
COMPLERN?

308
00:21:01,856 --> 00:21:04,648
THAT'S TOTALLY GOING TO THE
BLOOPER REEL!

309
00:21:04,648 --> 00:21:07,000
>> I DON'T GET NERVOUS.

310
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,747
>> ALL RIGHT, NOT BAD.

311
00:21:08,747 --> 00:21:13,020
DIDN'T EXPECT THIS GIGGLY ENERGY
FOR THIS KIND OF MOVIE.

312
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:18,167
ANYWAY, LET'S MOVE ON.
THE NEXT SCENE IS WHERE YOU DEAL
WITH YOUR FAMILY'S PAST.

313
00:21:18,167 --> 00:21:21,211

317
00:21:30,656 --> 00:21:32,876
>> I HAVE NOTHING TO SAY TO
FATHER.

318
00:21:32,876 --> 00:21:37,896
TO ME, HE IS ALREADY DEAD.
GOD

319
00:21:37,896 --> 00:21:41,484
>> I'M NOTHING LIKE HIM.
HE FLUNG OUR MOTHER OFF THE
DOCK.

320
00:21:41,484 --> 00:21:42,783
>> HE LOVED HER.

321
00:21:42,783 --> 00:21:47,217
>> IF HE LOVED HER, THEN WHY
WOULD HE FLING HER INTO THE
FJORD?

322
00:21:47,631 --> 00:21:50,682
>> HOW DARE YOU SAY THIS.

323
00:21:50,682 --> 00:21:55,583
>> I'M LEAVING.
I'M GOING TO --

324
00:21:55,583 --> 00:21:59,890
LINE?
>> KILL MYSELF.

00:22:01,131 --> 00:22:04,438
KILL

326
00:22:04,438 --> 00:22:07,836
>> OH, OH GOD!
HOW COULD YOU FORGET THAT?

327
00:22:07,836 --> 00:22:10,496
>> LET'S JUST GO STRAIGHT TO THE
BLOOPER REEL.

328
00:22:10,496 --> 00:22:13,013
>> ALL ABOUT THE BLOOPERS.

329
00:22:13,013 --> 00:22:16,453
>> OKAY, GUYS, GUYS -- "THE
STENCH OF A FAMILY"

330

335
00:22:33,419 --> 00:22:36,080
>> THIS HOUSE IS FULL OF GLOOM
AND DOOM.

336
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:38,770
>> BECAUSE FATHER IS SICK.

337
00:22:38,770 --> 00:22:41,256
HE THINKS HE'S MY MOTHER.

338
00:22:41,256 --> 00:22:46,840
EVERY DAY HE TRIES TO MAKE LOVE
TO ME AND PUSH ME DOWN THE HILL.

339
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:48,980
>> I DID NOT KNOW THAT.

340
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:51,050
>> COME HERE.

341
00:22:52,355 --> 00:22:56,275

OKAY, GUYS, THAT IS ENOUGH OF
THAT.
PLEASE.

345
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:13,457
I'M WORRIED WE'RE LOSING OUR
FOCUS HERE.

346
00:23:13,457 --> 00:23:16,977
SO YOU CAN HEAD TO THE NEXT SET
AND FINAL SCENE, OKAY?

347
00:23:16,977 --> 00:23:18,853
LET'S FOCUS UP, PLEASE.

348
00:23:18,853 --> 00:23:21,578
ALL RIGHT, THIS IS WHERE YOU SAY
GOOD-BYE TO YOUR FATHER

349
00:23:21,578 --> 00:23:25,645
IN THE
TUB FOR THE LAST TIME.
OKAY?

350
00:23:25,645 --> 00:23:28,565
AND ACTION!

351
00:23:28,983 --> 00:23:32,597
>> FATHER.
WE ARE HERE.

352
00:23:38,482 --> 00:23:40,909
>> HELLO, MY CHILDREN.

353
00:23:40,909 --> 00:23:44,128
I WANT TO APOLOGIZE TO YOU.

354
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:47,260
I'VE BECOME A STONE AROUND YOUR
NECK.

355
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:49,063
>> FATHER, DON'T SAY THIS.

356
00:23:49,063 --> 00:23:51,000
>> ALL THESE YEARS, YOU'VE HATED ME

357
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,569
FOR FLINGING YOUR MOTHER OFF
THE DOCK.

358
00:23:54,569 --> 00:23:58,856
BUT THE TRUTH IS, SHE FLUNG
HERSELF.

359
00:23:58,856 --> 00:24:02,081
I WANTED TO PROTECT YOU FROM THE
TRUTH.

360
00:24:02,081 --> 00:24:03,582
>> WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

361
00:24:03,582 --> 00:24:07,946
>> IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.
SHE JUST DIDN'T LIKE YOU.

362
00:24:09,621 --> 00:24:14,060
BUT NOW IT'S TIME TO DROWN
MYSELF IN THIS TUB.

363
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:17,190
SO I WILL NO LONGER HAVE TO SMELL THE

364

STENCH OF A FAMILY.

365
00:24:21,688 --> 00:24:25,350
>> MY ONLY ASK IS, HOLD MY HAND.

366
00:24:25,469 --> 00:24:28,798
AS I GO DOWN IN THE WATER.

367
00:24:28,798 --> 00:24:30,787
>> OF COURSE, FATHER.

368
00:24:30,787 --> 00:24:33,080
>> FETCH!

369
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:39,335
>> ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
>> WAY TO GO!

370
00:24:39,335 --> 00:24:44,249
>> THAT'S A BLOOPER!
- BLOOPER!

PASSPORT?

384
00:26:01,482 --> 00:26:04,125
>> NO, BUDDY, YOU DON'T HAVE TO
SHOW YOUR PASSPORT.

385
00:26:04,125 --> 00:26:08,947
YOU LOOK LIKE IF A RACIST GUY DRAW

HOW YOU PUNISH HIM?

390
00:26:27,389 --> 00:26:30,603
>> I'D KNEEL DOWN, LOOK INTO HIS SOUL,

391
00:26:30,603 --> 00:26:35,873
AND SAY, "THE SHAME IS
YOURS TO LIVE WITH."

392
00:26:36,736 --> 00:26:38,737
OKAY.

393
00:26:39,150 --> 00:26:41,581
SO YOU TALK TO HIM?

394
00:26:41,581 --> 00:26:44,391
I DON'T TALK, BUDDY, I SHOOT.

00:27:01,859 --> 00:27:05,774
I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT I'M
THINKING ABOUT YOUR PEOPLE LATELY,

400
00:27:05,774 --> 00:27:09,001
AND I WANTED TO DO
SOMETHING TO HELP.

401
00:27:09,001 --> 00:27:13,482
SO TA-DA!

402
00:27:15,909 --> 00:27:18,307
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH, MAN.

403
00:27:18,307 --> 00:27:22,598
THAT SHIRT IS GOING TO FIX
EVERYTHING.

404
00:27:23,194 --> 00:27:26,867
ANYWAY.
IT'S TIME FOR OUR NEXT SEGMENT

405
00:27:26,867 --> 00:27:28,848
CALLED, "HOW DO YOU HANDLE
THAT?"

406
00:27:28,848 --> 00:27:31,011
ARGUING WITH YOUR WIFE.

407
00:27:31,011 --> 00:27:35,269
WHAT DO YOU DO, HEIKE, WHEN YOU

00:27:35,269 --> 00:27:38,489
>> YES.
WE STAY SILENT.

409
00:27:38,489 --> 00:27:40,609
VERY INTENT.

410
00:27:40,609 --> 00:27:44,172
THEN ONE DAY, FINALLY,

411
00:27:44,172 --> 00:27:46,881
WE DIE.

412
00:27:47,618 --> 00:27:51,586
>> OKAY.
THAT'S SPOOKY, HEIKE.

413
00:27:51,586 --> 00:27:53,758
ME AND MY WIFE, WE DON'T DO
THAT.

414
00:27:53,758 --> 00:27:58,174
WE SCREAM, SCREAM, SCREAM, AND

415
00:27:58,174 --> 00:28:02,385

00:28:02,385 --> 00:28:06,751
AND USUALLY SHE SAY NO.

417
00:28:06,751 --> 00:28:09,825
KEVIN, HOW DO YOU HANDLE THIS?

418
00:28:09,825 --> 00:28:12,109
>> WELL, IT'S FUNNY YOU BRING
THAT UP.

419
00:28:12,109 --> 00:28:15,190
RECENTLY, ME AND MY WIFE GOT
INTO A LITTLE TIFF

420
00:28:15,190 --> 00:28:18,413
BECAUSE SHE
THINKS I'M TOO AFFECTIONATE WITH
OUR SON.

421
00:28:18,413 --> 00:28:21,805
BUT THAT IS NOT TRUE.
RIGHT, CONNER?

422
00:28:23,772 --> 00:28:26,295
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
YOU'RE THE BEST DAD EVER.

423
00:28:26,384 --> 00:28:29,615
>> ONLY BECAUSE YOU'RE THE BEST
SON EVER.

424
00:28:31,813 --> 00:28:36,810
NO, NO!
NO, NO, NO!

425
00:28:36,810 --> 00:28:39,733
DON'T DO IT HERE!

426
00:28:40,318 --> 00:28:42,573
SORRY

427
00:28:42,573 --> 00:28:46,725
>> I MEAN, I'M SURE YOUR DADS
SHOWED AFFECTION TO YOU,

428
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:48,390
RIGHT,
HEIKE?

429
00:28:48,390 --> 00:28:52,193
>> ONE TIME, ME AND MY FATHER
WERE SITTING IN A SAUNA.

430
00:28:52,193 --> 00:28:55,320
AND OUR KNEECAPS ACCIDENTALLY
TOUCHED.

431
00:28:55,320 --> 00:29:00,321
AND HE SAID, "TELL NO ONE OF
THIS."

432
00:29:05,557 --> 00:29:09,562
>> I TOLD YOU, TELL NO ONE OF
THIS.

433
00:29:09,935 --> 00:29:11,984
>> FORGIVE ME, FATHER.

434
00:29:11,984 --> 00:29:16,809
>> THE SHAME IS YOURS!
LIVE WITH IT!

435
00:29:25,205 --> 00:29:28,816
>> WHITE PEOPLE, VERY
INTERESTING.

436
00:29:28,816 --> 00:29:31,904
THEY NEVER SCREAM, YOU KNOW?

437
00:29:31,904 --> 00:29:34,617
THEY JUST PUSH IT DOWN, DOWN,
DOWN.

438
00:29:34,617 --> 00:29:37,787
AND THEN ONE DAY, THEY KILL
THEIR WIFE.

439
00:29:38,898 --> 00:29:42,240
ME AND MY WIFE, WE HAVE A
BEAUTIFUL RELATIONSHIP.

440
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:45,356
BECAUSE I DO WHATEVER I WANT.

441
00:29:45,356 --> 00:29:48,459
BECAUSE IT'S MY HOUSE, AND IT'S
MY RULES.

442
00:29:48,459 --> 00:29:53,373
>> JOAQUIN!
DRIVEWAY

443
00:29:53,373 --> 00:29:56,848
MY CAR
>> I'M SORRY, BABY.

444
00:29:56,848 --> 00:29:59,301
>> WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE?

445
00:29:59,544 --> 00:30:02,798
>> OH NO.

446
00:30:03,387 --> 00:30:06,217
>> BABY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO
ME, BABY?

447
00:30:06,217 --> 00:30:07,461
THESE ARE MY FRIENDS.

448
00:30:07,461 --> 00:30:08,578
NO, NO, NO!

449
00:30:08,578 --> 00:30:10,379
>> WHITE PEOPLE IN MY HOUSE.
- SORRY

450
00:30:10,379 --> 00:30:12,616
- KILL
>> I KNOW, I KNOW.

451
00:30:12,616 --> 00:30:14,196
SMOKE

452
00:30:14,196 --> 00:30:18,135
SMOKING IN MY HOUSE?

453
00:30:18,135 --> 00:30:21,384
HAVING THESE PEOPLE EAT MY FOOD?

454
00:30:23,314 --> 00:30:25,230
SICK OF YOU.

455
00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:27,719
>> DO YOU WANT TO HAVE SEX,

456
00:30:27,891 --> 00:30:29,810

>> LITTLE STUFF.
LIKE RAGNAR DURING THE RAIDS,

SAW YOU AND SNORR CUTTING A GUY
IN HALF.

480
00:31:54,874 --> 00:31:59,064
AND I WAS STANDING RIGHT NEXT TO
YOU READY WITH MY SWORD,

481
00:31:59,064 --> 00:32:01,638
AND NO
ONE EVEN THOUGHT OF LIKE,

482
00:32:01,638 --> 00:32:05,611
HEY,
AT SOME POINT MAYBE YOU WANT TO
JOIN US?

483
00:32:07,374 --> 00:32:09,976
>> I'M SORRY, MAN.

484
00:32:13,088 --> 00:32:16,519
>> AND THEN, LIKE, THIS IS MAYBE
KIND OF STUPID.

485
00:32:16,519 --> 00:32:20,825
BUT WHEN WE WERE PLAYING
FOOTBALL, NOBODY PASSED IT TO
ME.

486
00:32:21,724 --> 00:32:26,053
MAYBE I'M OVERREACTING, BUT I
FEEL LIKE THIS WEIRD TENSION IN
THE GROUP.

487
00:32:26,053 --> 00:32:27,552
>> AND I FEEL TERRIBLE.

488
00:32:27,552 --> 00:32:30,553
I DON'T EVEN WANT TO FINISH
SEWING A GOAT HEAD ON THIS MONK.

489
00:32:30,553 --> 00:32:34,958
>> THIS IS WHY I DIDN'T WANT TO
BRING IT OUT, I DIDN'T WANT TO
BUM EVERYONE OUT.

490
00:32:34,958 --> 00:32:37,088
WE SHOULD BE HAPPY RIGHT NOW.

491
00:32:37,088 --> 00:32:41,186
>> IT'S HARD TO BE HAPPY WHEN
YOU REALIZE YOU'VE BEEN ACTING
LIKE A FIRST-CLASS A-HOLE.

492
00:32:41,186 --> 00:32:43,859
>> NO-PENIS, STOP.

LET'S SKIN THIS CHRISTIAN rodent ,

494
00:32:47,730 --> 00:32:52,567
MAKE A HAT OUT OF HIS SKIN, STAY
HOME, AND FORGET ABOUT THE WHOLE
THING, OKAY?

495
00:32:52,567 --> 00:32:55,244
>> NO.

496
00:32:55,244 --> 00:32:59,031
MAKE A HAT OUT OF ME?
IT'S NOT GOING TO SOLVE WHAT'S
GOING ON WITH THE GROUP.

497
00:32:59,031 --> 00:33:00,452
>> THIS CHRISTIAN IS RIGHT.

>> FIRST TIME FOR EVERYTHING.

499
00:33:03,564 --> 00:33:05,837
>> THAT'S VERY FUNNY.

500
00:33:05,837 --> 00:33:10,437
BUT I THINK IVAR, MAYBE SOME OF
WHAT YOU'RE FEELING

501
00:33:10,437 --> 00:33:13,297
IS JEALOUSY.

502
00:33:13,297 --> 00:33:17,924
>> JEALOUSY -- OF YOU.
>> WHAT?

503
00:33:17,924 --> 00:33:20,099
>> WE WORSHIP YOU, MAN.

504
00:33:20,099 --> 00:33:24,021
>> ANY COLDNESS YOU FELT WASN'T
BECAUSE WE DIDN'T LIKE YOU

505
00:33:24,021 --> 00:33:28,857
BUT
BECAUSE WE WERE AFRAID YOU
WOULDN'T LIKE US.

506
00:33:28,857 --> 00:33:32,867
>> ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
YOU GUYS ARE THE BEST.

507
00:33:32,867 --> 00:33:37,279
>> CUT TO ME TELLING MY WIFE MY
HERO THINKS I'M THE BEST.

508
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:39,570
SHE'S LIKE, YEAH, OKAY, LIAR.

509
00:33:39,570 --> 00:33:43,733
>> SHUT UP!
I'M SO NOT YOUR HERO.

510
00:33:43,733 --> 00:33:45,463
>> YOU'RE EVERYONE'S HERO.

WHEN I WAS A TEENAGER, I HAD A
RUNE OF YOU ON MY BEDROOM WALL.

>> SO EMBARRASSING.
IS MY FACE RED?

518
00:34:03,744 --> 00:34:05,279
>> YES.
You're covered in blood.

519
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:10,248
>> THE ONLY CLIQUE WE WANT TO BE
IN IS YOURS.

00:49:26,581 --> 00:49:27,847
THESE ARE TWO GREAT TEAMS.

759
00:49:27,849 --> 00:49:29,248
AND THERE'S NO DOUBT IT WILL BE

760
00:49:29,250 --> 00:49:29,882
BACK AND FORTH ALL NIGHT.

761
00:49:29,884 --> 00:49:32,284
>> 100%.

762
00:49:32,286 --> 00:49:34,553
I PREDICT THAT THE PATRIOTS WILL

763
00:49:34,555 --> 00:49:36,756
BE ON TOP FOR THE FIRST HALF.

764
00:49:36,758 --> 00:49:39,859
THEN AT SOME POINT, THE SEAHAWKS

765
00:49:39,861 --> 00:49:40,559
WILL COME FROM BEHIND AND --

766
00:49:44,966 --> 00:49:45,631
DOMINATE THE PATRIOTS FOR A

767
00:49:45,633 --> 00:49:48,567
LITTLE WHILE.

768
00:49:48,569 --> 00:49:50,002
>> YEAH.

769
00:49:50,004 --> 00:49:52,605
THEN MAYBE THE PATRIOTS GET

770
00:49:52,607 --> 00:49:54,373
TIRED AND ASK THE SEAHAWKS TO

771
00:49:54,375 --> 00:49:55,074
PLAY THEMSELVES FOR A LITTLE

772
00:49:55,076 --> 00:49:55,374
WHILE.

773
00:50:01,649 --> 00:50:02,581
OR THE PATRIOTS GO WATCH ON THE

774
00:50:02,583 --> 00:50:02,948
SIDELINES.

775
00:50:04,585 --> 00:50:05,251
>> OKAY, WHAT ARE YOU GUYS

776
00:50:05,253 --> 00:50:05,684
TALKING ABOUT?

777
00:50:08,356 --> 00:50:09,588
>> WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE SUPER

778
00:50:09,590 --> 00:50:10,556
BOWL, COLIN.

779
00:50:10,558 --> 00:50:11,924
IT'S THE BIGGEST GAME OF THE

780
00:50:11,926 --> 00:50:12,224
YEAR.

781
00:50:12,226 --> 00:50:13,292
SO YOU KNOW, WHATEVER HAPPENS,

782
00:50:13,294 --> 00:50:14,026
ALL I KNOW IS -- SOMEONE'S

783
00:50:14,028 --> 00:50:21,967
GETTING A RING.

784
00:50:21,969 --> 00:50:23,536
>> YOU THINK THAT SOMEONE WILL

785
00:50:23,538 --> 00:50:23,936
GET A RING?

786
00:50:23,938 --> 00:50:26,972
>> OH, WOW.

787
00:50:26,974 --> 00:50:27,673
WELL, PROBABLY NOT LIKE THAT

788
00:50:27,675 --> 00:50:29,542
NIGHT.

789
00:50:29,544 --> 00:50:32,011
>> I DIDN'T SAY THAT NIGHT.

790
00:50:32,013 --> 00:50:33,579
>> LOOK, I THINK THE PATRIOTS

791
00:50:33,581 --> 00:50:34,280
JUST THOUGHT THIS WAS, LIKE,

792
00:50:34,282 --> 00:50:34,580
CHILL.

793
00:50:36,150 --> 00:50:37,550
>> OH, OH, OKAY.

794
00:50:37,552 --> 00:50:38,818
OH, THE PATRIOTS THOUGHT IT WAS

795
00:50:38,820 --> 00:50:39,552
SUPER CHILL.

796
00:50:39,554 --> 00:50:41,187
THEY THOUGHT THE SUPER BOWL WAS

797
00:50:41,189 --> 00:50:44,056
CHILL, OKAY.

798
00:50:44,058 --> 00:50:44,356
WELL.

799
00:50:44,358 --> 00:50:46,826
I THINK IF THE SEAHAWKS KNEW

800
00:50:46,828 --> 00:50:48,527
THAT, THEY WOULDN'T HAVE DONE

801
00:50:48,529 --> 00:50:49,995
THE TUSH PUSH IN COLIN'S

802
00:50:49,997 --> 00:50:50,463
DRESSING ROOM.

803
00:50:50,465 --> 00:50:52,364
>> MY DRESSING ROOM AGAIN?

804
00:50:52,366 --> 00:50:53,933
>> THE TUSH PUSH?

805
00:50:53,935 --> 00:50:55,935
IF I RECALL, THE SEAHAWKS CALLED

806
00:50:55,937 --> 00:50:56,435
THAT PLAY.

807
00:50:56,437 --> 00:50:57,870
THE PATRIOTS WERE ACTUALLY

808
00:50:57,872 --> 00:50:59,205
SCARED TO DO IT BECAUSE THEY'D

809
00:50:59,207 --> 00:50:59,839
ONLY EVER SEEN IT ON FILM.

810
00:51:01,709 --> 00:51:03,576
>> THE SECOND THE SEAHAWKS

811
00:51:03,578 --> 00:51:04,310
MUTTERED TUSH PUSH, THE PATRIOTS

812
00:51:04,312 --> 00:51:04,677
SCORED --

813
00:51:04,679 --> 00:51:07,413
>> OKAY.

814
00:51:07,415 --> 00:51:07,813
OH, MY GOSH.

815
00:51:07,815 --> 00:51:08,514
TWO PEOPLE WHO JUST HOOKED UP.

816
00:51:12,453 --> 00:51:14,820
FOR "WEEKEND UPDATE," I'M COLIN

817
00:51:14,822 --> 00:51:15,121
JOST.

818
00:51:15,123 --> 00:51:17,556
>> I'M MICHAEL CHE, GOOD NIGHT!

819
00:51:44,251 --> 00:51:48,687
>> THANK YOU GIRLS FOR COMING

820
00:51:48,689 --> 00:51:50,189
OVER TO HANG WITH AGNES.

821
00:51:50,191 --> 00:51:51,590
SHE HASN'T REALLY HAD A CHANCE

822
00:51:51,592 --> 00:51:53,626
TO MEET ANY OTHER KIDS SINCE WE

823
00:51:53,628 --> 00:51:54,793
MOVED HERE FROM IOWA.

824
00:51:54,795 --> 00:51:55,594
RIGHT, AGNES?

825
00:51:55,596 --> 00:51:58,197
DON'T BE SHY, COME ON.

826
00:51:58,199 --> 00:51:58,664
>> STOP IT, MOM.

827
00:52:02,203 --> 00:52:02,902
YOU'RE EMBARRASSING ME, MOM.

828
00:52:02,904 --> 00:52:05,437
>> COME ON, SIT.

829
00:52:05,439 --> 00:52:05,804
BE NICE.

830
00:52:05,806 --> 00:52:08,274
>> HI, GUYS.

831
00:52:08,276 --> 00:52:09,341
>> HI, AGNES.

832
00:52:09,343 --> 00:52:09,775
>> I'M AGNES.

833
00:52:09,777 --> 00:52:12,044
>> HI, AGNES.

834
00:52:12,046 --> 00:52:13,345
>> OH, OKAY.

835
00:52:13,347 --> 00:52:14,547
WELL, I'M GOING TO GET OUT OF

836
00:52:14,549 --> 00:52:15,080
YOUR HAIR.

837
00:52:15,082 --> 00:52:17,750
YOU GIRLS HAVE FUN.

838
00:52:17,752 --> 00:52:18,717
CALL ME IF YOU NEED ME, I'LL BE

839
00:52:18,719 --> 00:52:20,052
DRINKING IN THE KITCHEN.

840
00:52:20,054 --> 00:52:20,586
>> THANKS.

841
00:52:20,588 --> 00:52:21,587
>> BYE, MOM.

842
00:52:21,589 --> 00:52:23,222
>> AGNES, WHAT DID YOU DO BACK

843
00:52:23,224 --> 00:52:24,723
IN IOWA FOR FUN?

844
00:52:24,725 --> 00:52:26,158

00:52:30,064 --> 00:52:32,431
HOW ABOUT YOU GUYS?

849
00:52:32,433 --> 00:52:33,065
>> I LOVE CARTOONS.

850
00:52:33,067 --> 00:52:34,066
HAVE YOU SEEN BLUEY?

851
00:52:34,068 --> 00:52:34,733
>> NO.

852
00:52:34,735 --> 00:52:37,303
>> YOU DON'T WATCH BLUEY?

853
00:52:37,305 --> 00:52:38,704
>> NO, I'VE NEVER SEEN IT.

854
00:52:38,706 --> 00:52:40,005
>> NOT EVEN ONCE?

855
00:52:40,007 --> 00:52:42,441
>> I DON'T THINK SO, NO.

856
00:52:42,443 --> 00:52:44,176
>> YOU'VE NEVER SEEN BLUEY?

857
00:52:44,178 --> 00:52:45,811
LIKE, HOW IS THAT EVEN POSSIBLE?

858
00:52:45,813 --> 00:52:46,445
>> I SAID I NEVER SAW IT!

859
00:52:48,182 --> 00:52:50,916
WHO CARES!

860
00:52:50,918 --> 00:52:51,317
>> OH, OKAY.

861
00:52:51,319 --> 00:52:53,652
NO WORRIES.

862
00:52:53,654 --> 00:52:54,920
>> SORRY ABOUT THAT.

863
00:52:54,922 --> 00:52:56,889
TOTAL OOPS ON MY PART.

864
00:52:56,891 --> 00:52:57,223
SORRY.

>> THAT'S OKAY.

866
00:52:58,759 --> 00:53:00,226
ANYWAY, BLUEY IS REALLY COOL.

867
00:53:00,228 --> 00:53:01,260
YOU SHOULD TOTALLY CHECK IT OUT.

868
00:53:01,262 --> 00:53:06,031
>> I WILL, THANKS, JENNIFER.

869
00:53:06,033 --> 00:53:07,600
SO, WHAT KIND OF MUSIC DO YOU

887
00:53:37,431 --> 00:53:39,898
I THOUGHT EVERYONE KNEW HARRY

888
00:53:39,900 --> 00:53:40,232

00:53:40,234 --> 00:53:41,834
>> I SAID I DON'T, OKAY?

890
00:53:41,836 --> 00:53:42,101

WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE!

00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:47,139
SORRY.

00:53:47,141 --> 00:53:50,809
I DID IT AGAIN.

00:53:53,047 --> 00:53:54,280
HOW'S EVERYONE GETTING ALONG?

>> GREAT.

900
00:53:54,949 --> 00:53:56,615
WHEN WILL IT BE OVER?

901
00:53:57,018 --> 00:53:58,517
>> OH, I TOLD YOUR MOMS TO PICK

916
00:54:18,372 --> 00:54:20,606
>> STOP ASKING HER IF SHE KNOWS

917
00:54:20,608 --> 00:54:20,906

EVERYBODY CAN GET IT.

924
00:54:35,423 --> 00:54:37,256
>> THAT'S OKAY, IT LOOKS KIND OF

925
00:54:37,258 --> 00:54:37,556
HARD.

926
00:54:37,558 --> 00:54:38,791
>> COME ON, AGNES, JUST DO IT.

01:03:38,220 --> 01:03:40,984
>> MY KIND OF SENSE OF HUMOR, I
GUESS.

1081
01:03:40,984 --> 01:03:45,179
>> JESSICA, WHEN YOU SAID YOU
WERE BRINGING YOUR NEW BOYFRIEND
ON OUR SKI TRIP,

1082
01:03:45,179 --> 01:03:47,033
WAS HONEST, I
WAS FURIOUS.

1083
01:03:47,033 --> 01:03:49,362
BUT WOW, HE'S SO FUNNY.

1084
01:03:49,362 --> 01:03:53,289
>> FUNNY IN A COOL, EDGY WAY,

YOU'RE SO LUCKY, GIRL.

1085
01:03:53,289 --> 01:03:56,261
>> YEAH, STEVE'S QUITE THE
COMEDIAN.

1086
01:03:56,261 --> 01:03:59,009
>> YOU WANT ME TO TAKE THAT COAT
FOR YOU?
LOOKS HOT.

1087
01:03:59,009 --> 01:04:01,037
>> NO, I'LL KEEP IT ON.

1088
01:04:01,037 --> 01:04:04,965
THANKS FOR LETTING ME COME.
THIS IS MORE FUN THAN --

1089
01:04:04,965 --> 01:04:07,811
SMOKING
CRACK WITH SUSAN BOYLE.

1090
01:04:07,811 --> 01:04:11,438
>> OH, DUDE!
- WHAT

1091
01:04:11,438 --> 01:04:16,051
>> WOW.
ALL MY FRIENDS THINK YOU'RE
HILARIOUS.

1092
01:04:16,051 --> 01:04:18,525
ACTUALLY MAKING ME PRETTY HORNY.

1093
01:04:18,525 --> 01:04:22,312
>> WHY DON'T WE GO TAKE CARE OF
THAT?
>> I'D LIKE THAT.

1094
01:04:22,312 --> 01:04:27,963
>> GUYS, IT WAS SO GREAT TO MEET
YOU ALL, BUT WE SHOULD GET
GOING.

1095
01:04:33,501 --> 01:04:35,338
OH, CRAP.

1096
01:04:35,338 --> 01:04:38,815
>> BABE?
WHAT IS ALL THIS?

1097
01:04:38,815 --> 01:04:41,587
>> I DON'T KNOW.
THIS IS REALLY WEIRD.

1098
01:04:41,587 --> 01:04:43,572
WHAT IS ALL THIS STUFF?

1099
01:04:45,035 --> 01:04:48,388
>> SMOKING CRACK WITH SUSAN
BOYLE?

1100
01:04:48,388 --> 01:04:52,524
DAVE, ARE THESE CARDS AGAINST
HUMANITY CARDS?

1101
01:04:52,524 --> 01:04:54,473
>> I DON'T THINK SO, WHAT?

1102
01:04:54,473 --> 01:04:58,102
>> DAVE, ARE YOU READING OFF
CARDS AGAINST HUMANITY CARDS

1103
01:04:58,102 --> 01:05:00,250
TO
MAKE PEOPLE THINK THAT YOU'RE
FUNNY?

1104
01:05:00,250 --> 01:05:03,573
>> NO, THAT WOULD BE WEIRD, LIKE
WHAT?

1105
01:05:05,050 --> 01:05:08,387
>> POOPING YOUR PANTS AT
LEGOLAND.

1106
01:05:08,387 --> 01:05:10,951
DAVE, YOU SAID TO TO ME BUT
MOMENTS AGO.

1107
01:05:10,951 --> 01:05:13,895
>> I DON'T THINK SO --
>> I KNOW SO.

1108
01:05:13,895 --> 01:05:16,399
I ASKED WHAT YOU DID FOR A
LIVING AND YOU SAID,

1109
01:05:16,399 --> 01:05:18,798
POOPING
YOUR PANTS AT LEGOLAND.

1110
01:05:18,798 --> 01:05:22,084
I REMEMBER BECAUSE I LAUGHED SO
HARD, I POOPED MY PANTS.

1111
01:05:22,084 --> 01:05:24,186
I HAD TO GET MY GYM SHORTS FROM
MY CAR.

1112
01:05:24,296 --> 01:05:27,112
>> THIS IS SO WEIRD.
I WANT TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF
THIS.

1113
01:05:27,112 --> 01:05:31,134
>> AN INCONVENIENT BONER WHILE
WATCHING "MARLEY & ME"?

1114
01:05:31,134 --> 01:05:34,001
DAVE, YOU SAID THIS WORD FOR
WORD TO ME.

1115
01:05:34,001 --> 01:05:36,165
>> WHY WOULD I SAY THAT?

1116
01:05:36,165 --> 01:05:39,539
>> BECAUSE I ASKED YOU IF YOU
WERE WORRIED ABOUT TRAFFIC LATER,

1117
01:05:39,539 --> 01:05:44,281
AND YOU SAID YOU WERE
MORE WORRIED ABOUT AN
INCONVENIENT BONER WHILE
WATCHING "MARLEY & ME."

1118
01:05:44,281 --> 01:05:47,358
I REMEMBER BECAUSE I LAUGHED SO
HARD, I TRIED TO KISS YOU.

1119
01:05:47,358 --> 01:05:50,062
>> I DON'T REMEMBER THAT AT ALL.

1120
01:05:50,351 --> 01:05:55,718
>> DROPPING ACID WITH THE
MARIACHI BAND AT JOSH GAD'S KEEN
SIN YARA.

1121
01:05:55,718 --> 01:05:59,273
>> I DON'T RECALL THAT.

1122
01:05:59,278 --> 01:06:02,100
>> I TOLD YOU MY UNCLE DIED

1123
01:06:02,100 --> 01:06:06,555
AND YOU SAID THAT SOUNDS WORSE THAN
DROPPING ACID WITH THE MARIACHI BAND

1124
01:06:06,555 --> 01:06:08,472
AT JOSH GAD'S KEEN SINNER
IN RA.

1125
01:06:08,472 --> 01:06:10,768
HARD

1126
01:06:10,768 --> 01:06:12,655
LOVE

1127
01:06:12,655 --> 01:06:16,475
>> WHO ARE YOU?
I DON'T KNOW YOU ANYMORE.

1128
01:06:16,475 --> 01:06:19,246
ARE YOU EVEN TWISTED?
>> NO,

1129
01:06:19,246 --> 01:06:22,697
I'M JUST -- NORMAL!

1130
01:06:24,266 --> 01:06:27,035
GROWING UP, I NEVER SAID
ANYTHING TWISTED.

1131
01:06:27,035 --> 01:06:30,361
SOMEONE ASKED WHAT I WANTED FOR
LUNCH, I'D SAY A SANDWICH.

1132
01:06:30,361 --> 01:06:32,723
INSTEAD OF SOMETHING AWESOME
LIKE --

1133
01:06:35,605 --> 01:06:40,265
JACKING OFF THE KOOL-AID MAN
TILL HE SAYS "OH YEAH."

1134
01:06:40,265 --> 01:06:43,455
THEN IN COLLEGE, I PLAYED CARDS
AGAINST HUMANITY.

1135
01:06:43,455 --> 01:06:47,300
YOU KNOW.
I PICKED OUT A CARD AND PEOPLE
WOULD LAUGH AND GO,

1136
01:06:47,300 --> 01:06:50,489
DAMN THAT
BOY AIN'T RIGHT, YOU NEED JESUS!

1137
01:06:50,489 --> 01:06:54,230
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE I
FELT GOATED.

1138
01:06:54,230 --> 01:06:56,966
BODIED WITH A SAUCE.

1139
01:06:56,966 --> 01:07:01,873
YOU HEAR ME, MA?
YOUR BOY IS GOLDEN!

1140
01:07:01,873 --> 01:07:05,567
GOLDEN WITH A SAUCE!

1141
01:07:06,506 --> 01:07:11,249
AFTER THAT I DECIDED TO CARRY AT
LEAST THREE DECKS OF CARDS WITH ME AT ALL TIMES

1142
01:07:11,249 --> 01:07:15,399
AND FLAWLESSLY
WORK THEM INTO EVERY
CONVERSATION.

1143
01:07:15,399 --> 01:07:19,114
>> OKAY.
WELL.
ARE YOU GOING TO --

1144
01:07:19,932 --> 01:07:22,909
ARE YOU GOING TO PICK THESE UP,
THEN?

1145
01:07:22,909 --> 01:07:26,460
>> YEAH, OF COURSE.
OF COURSE I AM.

1146
01:07:26,460 --> 01:07:29,219
OF COURSE I AM, WHO DO YOU THINK
I AM?

1147
01:07:29,219 --> 01:07:31,396
HITLER'S HAIRY BUTT CRACK?

1148
01:07:31,396 --> 01:07:35,047
>> DUDE!
YOU NEED JESUS!

1149
01:07:57,046 --> 01:07:59,672
CARDI

1150
01:07:59,672 --> 01:08:01,903
PETE

1151
01:08:01,903 --> 01:08:04,194
STELLAN

1152
01:08:04,194 --> 01:08:07,038
MACFRER.

1153
01:08:07,039 --> 01:08:11,524
LORNE
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

1154
01:08:11,524 --> 01:08:14,013
THANK YOU, EVERYONE, FOR COMING.
