>>> AND NOW, A MESSAGE FROM THE
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.

2
00:00:07,378 --> 00:00:09,478
>>> MY FELLOW AMERICANS,

3
00:00:09,478 --> 00:00:13,204
THIS TUESDAY, OUR MIDTERM ELECTIONS
WILL DETERMINE THE FATE OF OUR DEMOCRACY,

4
00:00:13,204 --> 00:00:16,300
AND LET'S JUST SAY,
BIG YIKES.

5
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:20,810
WHAT'S GOING ON?
I GUESS THE DEMOCRATS MESSAGE
JUST AIN'T GETTING THROUGH.

6
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:24,257
PLUS, I'M OVER HERE TALKING TO
PEOPLE WHO DON'T EXIST.
I DOT KNOW MUCH.

7
00:00:24,257 --> 00:00:28,064
WHO'S THAT?
NOBODY'S THERE.

8
00:00:28,064 --> 00:00:30,754
FOLKS, I'M TRYING LIKE HELL, I
PROMISE.

9
00:00:30,755 --> 00:00:33,950
PELOTON
TEMPTING FATE

10
00:00:34,492 --> 00:00:37,943
I PASS THAT BIG ASS
INFRASTRUCTURE BILL.
REMEMBER THAT?

11
00:00:37,943 --> 00:00:40,643
$65 BILLION.

12
00:00:40,643 --> 00:00:43,651
LOT OF YOU RED STATE  GOT
BROADBAND INTERNET

13
00:00:43,651 --> 00:00:48,682
SO YOU CAN
SHARE YOUR PAUL PELOSI GAY
INTERNET FICTION AT LIGHTNING
SPEED.

14
00:00:48,682 --> 00:00:54,243
BY THE WAY
YOU RIGHT THINKERS SURE DO LOVE
THINKING UP THESE GAY SCENARIOS.

15
00:00:54,243 --> 00:00:56,642
KIND OF SUS.

16
00:00:56,642 --> 00:00:59,494
I GET IT.

17
00:00:59,494 --> 00:01:01,164
I'M NO SPRING CHICKEN,

18
00:01:01,164 --> 00:01:04,528
BUT PEOPLE ARE YELLING AT OBAMA
CALLING HIM HOT.

19
00:01:04,601 --> 00:01:06,850
HOW DO YOU THINK THAT MAKES ME
FEEL?

20
00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:09,999
DO YOURSELF A FAVOR, GOOGLE
YOUNG JOE BIDEN

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,791
AND START A
BUBBLE BATH.

22
00:01:19,848 --> 00:01:21,616
YOU GUYS THINK I'M BORING NOW?

23
00:01:21,747 --> 00:01:24,040
WELL, I CAN DO CRAZY STUFF TOO.

24
00:01:25,016 --> 00:01:26,855
I SCARED MYSELF.

25
00:01:26,855 --> 00:01:29,091
LISTEN, FOLKS, THAT'S THE
PROBLEM.

26
00:01:29,091 --> 00:01:31,044
WE DON'T HAVE ANY STARS ANYMORE.

27
00:01:31,133 --> 00:01:34,557
TOO MANY RAPHAEL WARNOCKS AND
NOT ENOUGH HERSCHEL WALKERS,

28
00:01:34,557 --> 00:01:38,548
WHICH IS WHY WE'RE GOING TO MAKE
SOME CHANGES BEFORE NEXT TUESDAY

LEVEL FOUR ENCHANTRESS,

35
00:01:57,330 --> 00:02:00,194
I'M

DREAM,

36
00:02:00,194 --> 00:02:04,489

00:02:17,341 --> 00:02:19,991
HE WAS THE MAYOR OF FLAVOR TOWN
FOR OVER 20 YEARS,

41
00:02:19,991 --> 00:02:21,726
GUY FIERI.

BUT DO Y'ALL WANT A

00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:39,203

47
00:02:39,905 --> 00:02:42,515

I WANT NO CAP ON SOCIAL
SECURITIES.

00:03:13,384 --> 00:03:16,070
SEASON SEVEN

59
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:20,249
BUT I'M WILLING TO DEBACE MYSELF
AND ENTER U.S. POLITICS.

60
00:03:20,249 --> 00:03:21,846
I CAN WORK WITH ANYONE,

61
00:03:21,846 --> 00:03:25,064
AND I'M WILLING TO REACH AROUND THE
AISLE TO GET THINGS DONE.

62
00:03:25,064 --> 00:03:27,925
>> I THINK IT'S REACH ACROSS THE
AISLE.

63
00:03:27,925 --> 00:03:29,973
>> SURE.
YOU DO YOU.

64
00:03:30,246 --> 00:03:32,300
>> TALENTED ACTRESS.

65
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:35,445
NOW INTRODUCING SOMEONE WHO'S
GOING TO BEAT MARCO RUBIO

66
00:03:35,445 --> 00:03:37,407
BECAUSE SHE'S NOT AFRAID TO
FIGHT.

67
00:03:37,407 --> 00:03:41,490
SHE'S YOUR NEXT SENATOR FOR
FLORIDA, AZAELIA BANKS.

68
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:44,435
>> I'M A WITCH, BITCH!

69
00:03:50,082 --> 00:03:52,284
>> OKAY.

70
00:03:52,284 --> 00:03:55,446
FINALLY, PEOPLE GOT MAT AT ME

71
00:03:55,446 --> 00:03:58,313
BUT HE'S IN CHARGE OF IT NOW.
TRACY MORGAN.

72
00:03:59,659 --> 00:04:02,438
>> OKAY.
Y'ALL WANT THAT MONEY?

73
00:04:02,438 --> 00:04:05,717
WHY DON'T YOU COME ON OVER HERE
AND RUB MY BELLY.

74
00:04:05,717 --> 00:04:07,201
>> THANK YOU, TRACY.

75
00:04:07,201 --> 00:04:09,768
EVERYBODY, GET UP HERE.

76
00:04:09,768 --> 00:04:12,161
THERE THEY ARE, YOUR NEW
DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES.

77
00:04:12,161 --> 00:04:14,536
ALL RIGHT, TEAM.
WHAT DO WE WANT?

78
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:19,492
>> I KIND OF WANT SOME
SUGAR-FREE WHITE CASTLE.

79
00:04:19,923 --> 00:04:22,058
>> WHEN DO WE WANT IT?

80
00:04:22,766 --> 00:04:26,728
>> I MEAN, MY MIND IS LIKE
WHENEVER YOU GOOD, BABY GIRL.

81
00:04:26,728 --> 00:04:30,169
>> ALL RIGHT.
LET'S GO, TEAM.
WE'RE GOING TO BE FINE.

82
00:04:30,169 --> 00:04:34,144
AND LIVE FROM NEW YORK, IT'S
SATURDAY NIGHT!

83
00:06:40,993 --> 00:06:45,494
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, AMY

84
00:07:02,968 --> 00:07:05,211
>>> THANK YOU.

85
00:07:05,211 --> 00:07:08,008
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

86
00:07:08,008 --> 00:07:10,671
IT'S SO GREAT TO BE BACK HERE
HOSTING "SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE."

87
00:07:10,671 --> 00:07:14,721
I HAVE BEEN SO BUSY.
YOU MAY HAVE SEEN MY HULU SHOW,
LIFE AND BETH

88
00:07:14,721 --> 00:07:19,092
AND "INSIDE AMY
SCHUMER IS BACK ON PARAMOUNT+"

89
00:07:20,884 --> 00:07:24,854
AND I CAN'T BELIEVE I HAVE THE
HONOR OF BEING THE FINAL HOST

90
00:07:24,854 --> 00:07:26,734
BEFORE THE MIDTERM ABORTIONS --

91
00:07:26,734 --> 00:07:29,094
ELECTIONS.
WHAT DID I SAY?

92
00:07:29,094 --> 00:07:32,513
SORRY.
I WAS THINKING ABOUT WHAT'S AT
STAKE IF WE DON'T VOTE.

93
00:07:32,955 --> 00:07:36,743
PEOPLE LOVE GIVING PREGNANT
WOMEN ADVICE, DON'T THEY?

94
00:07:36,743 --> 00:07:40,015
THE WHOLE TIME I WAS PREGNANT, I
HAD THIS ONE FRIEND TELLING ME,

95
00:07:40,015 --> 00:07:43,958
YOU GOT TO DO PRENATAL YOGA.
IT REALLY HELPS WITH THE BIRTH.

96
00:07:43,958 --> 00:07:48,384
SO I IMMEDIATELY SIGNED UP FOR A
C-SECTION.

97
00:07:50,063 --> 00:07:54,813
BUT NO, I DID.
I HAD A C, HE CAME OUT THE
SUNROOF.

98
00:07:55,623 --> 00:07:58,914
NO MATTER HOW YOU GIVE BIRTH,
THE DOCTORS ALL TELL YOU --

99
00:07:58,914 --> 00:08:01,417
IT
COULD BE VAGINAL, C-SECTION.

100
00:08:01,417 --> 00:08:03,358
THEY ALMOST NEVER COME OUT OF
YOUR BUTT HOLE.

101
00:08:03,358 --> 00:08:06,111
BUT THEY TELL YOU, NO MATTER WHAT,

102
00:08:06,111 --> 00:08:09,011
THE DOCTORS SAY,

103
00:08:09,011 --> 00:08:12,796
YOU CANNOT HAVE SEX FOR SIX WEEKS.

104
00:08:12,796 --> 00:08:15,027
YOU GOT IT?
SIX WEEKS, NO SEX.

105
00:08:15,027 --> 00:08:17,288
I WAS LIKE, OKAY.

106
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:23,675
REMEMBER WHEN YOU JUST
WOLVERINED ME OPEN?

107
00:08:23,939 --> 00:08:28,447
REMEMBER THAT?
HOW ABOUT SIX YEARS?

108
00:08:28,447 --> 00:08:30,650
THAT'S WHEN I THINK I'LL BE
READY.

109
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:33,841
OKAY?
REMEMBER, HIS FOOT GOT CAUGHT ON
MY INTESTINES.

110
00:08:33,841 --> 00:08:38,312
WHEN CAN I GET RAW DOGGED FROM
BEHIND?
PLEASE.

111
00:08:41,952 --> 00:08:46,021
BUT MY HUSBAND AND I, WE DO HAVE
A GOOD SEX LIFE.

112
00:08:46,021 --> 00:08:50,025
MARRIED PEOPLE, WE HAVE FOUND
THAT THE BEST WEEKDAY TO HAVE SEX

113
00:08:50,025 --> 00:08:52,920
IS ALWAYS TOMORROW.

114
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:55,617
YEAH.
WE'RE LIKE, WE ATE TODAY.

115
00:08:55,690 --> 00:08:59,709
MAYBE WE WON'T EAT TOMORROW.
THAT WILL BE A GOOD DAY FOR US.

116
00:09:00,637 --> 00:09:05,090
MY HUSBAND'S THE BEST.
HE ALWAYS -- BEFORE WE HAVE SEX,
HE PUTS THE LIGHTS ON,

117
00:09:05,090 --> 00:09:08,355
YOU KNOW,
AND I SHUT THEM OFF, AND HE PUTS
THEM ON.

118
00:09:08,355 --> 00:09:12,262
AND HE'S LIKE, AMY, WHY ARE YOU
SO SHY?
YOU HAVE A BEAUTIFUL BODY.

119
00:09:12,262 --> 00:09:14,932
I'M LIKE, OH, MY GOD.
YOU'RE SO CUTE.

120
00:09:14,932 --> 00:09:18,812
YOU THINK I DON'T WANT YOU TO
SEE ME.

121
00:09:24,525 --> 00:09:26,901
SO SWEET, RIGHT?

122
00:09:27,505 --> 00:09:30,583
BUT IT IS.
I'LL BE HONEST, IT'S AWKWARD

123
00:09:30,583 --> 00:09:32,779
HAVING SEX WITH YOUR SPOUSE, IT
IS.

124
00:09:32,779 --> 00:09:36,965
BECAUSE, LIKE, THAT'S YOUR
FAMILY.

125
00:09:36,965 --> 00:09:40,936
YOU KNOW?
LIKE I HAVE THANKSGIVING WITH
YOU.

126
00:09:40,936 --> 00:09:43,854
I LAY OUT YOUR SWEATERS, YOU
KNOW?

127
00:09:43,854 --> 00:09:48,092
LIKE I CAN'T GO DOWN ON YOU.
YOU'RE MY EMERGENCY CONTACT FOR
CHRIST'S SAKE.

128
00:09:48,092 --> 00:09:50,406
IT'S SICK.

129
00:09:50,406 --> 00:09:53,821
WE CAN'T TALK DIRTY TO EACH
ANYMORE.

130
00:09:53,821 --> 00:09:56,165
WE KNOW EACH OTHER TOO WELL.

131
00:09:56,165 --> 00:09:58,445
I'M ALWAYS LIKE, I'M GOING TO --

132
00:09:58,445 --> 00:10:00,669
HE'S LIKE, NO, YOU'RE NOT.

133
00:10:00,669 --> 00:10:04,059
I'M LIKE, NO, NO, I'M NOT.

134
00:10:04,059 --> 00:10:06,560
WE DO A LOT OF ROLE PLAY.

135
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,391
BUT I ALWAYS PICK THE SAME ROLE.

136
00:10:08,391 --> 00:10:11,619
I'M ALWAYS LIKE, OKAY, I

137
00:10:11,619 --> 00:10:14,264
AM IN A COMA.

138
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,159
GO.

139
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:25,288
MY HUSBAND IS DIAGNOSED, HE'S ON
THE AUTISM SPECTRUM.

140
00:10:25,288 --> 00:10:27,989
HE HAS AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER.

141
00:10:27,989 --> 00:10:29,760
USED TO BE CALLED ASPERGER'S,

142
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,317
BUT TURNS OUT

143
00:10:31,317 --> 00:10:35,910
THAT HAD LIKE NAZI
TIES, KANYE.

144
00:10:46,738 --> 00:10:48,352
ISN'T THAT CRAZY?

145
00:10:48,352 --> 00:10:51,946
BUT NO.
IT'S BEEN REALLY POSITIVE FOR
OUR FAMILY

146
00:10:51,946 --> 00:10:53,820
TO HAVE HIM
DIAGNOSED.

147
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:56,933
I UNDERSTAND SO MUCH MORE ABOUT
HIS BEHAVIOR,

148
00:10:56,933 --> 00:10:58,455
AND IT'S GIVEN HIM
SO MANY TOOLS.

149
00:10:58,455 --> 00:11:02,383
NOW, IF SOMEBODY IS IN THE
MIDDLE OF A LONG, BORING STORY,

150
00:11:02,383 --> 00:11:06,579
HE WILL STRAIGHT UP JUST WALK
AWAY.

151
00:11:08,174 --> 00:11:12,158
AND WHEN PEOPLE FIND OUT THAT HE
HAS AUTISM, THEY DON'T KNOW MUCH
ABOUT IT.

152
00:11:12,158 --> 00:11:14,712
THEY'RE LIKE, OH, DOES HE LOVE
TO COUNT?

153
00:11:17,012 --> 00:11:20,873
SHOULD WE DROP A BUNCH OF STRAWS ON THE FLOOR

154
00:11:20,873 --> 00:11:24,178
AND HE CAN GATHER
THEM AND COUNT THEM?

155
00:11:24,638 --> 00:11:28,206
I'M LIKE, YEAH, THAT SOUNDS
PRETTY FUN.
I WOULD LIKE TO DO THAT.

156
00:11:29,103 --> 00:11:31,878
HE NEVER REALLY LANDS A
COMPLIMENT WITH ME.

157
00:11:31,878 --> 00:11:35,088
HE TELLS ME I LOOK COMFORTABLE A
LOT.

158
00:11:36,207 --> 00:11:37,989
WE HAVE DIFFERENT LOVE
LANGUAGES.

159
00:11:37,989 --> 00:11:40,743
A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO, WE WERE
SITTING OUTSIDE.

160
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:44,064
IT WAS A NICE NIGHT.
IT LOOKED LIKE IT WAS GOING TO
RAIN.

161
00:11:44,064 --> 00:11:46,012
I WAS FEELING SENTIMENTAL.

162
00:11:46,012 --> 00:11:49,926
I WAS LIKE, EVEN THOUGH THESE
PAST COUPLE OF YEARS

163
00:11:49,926 --> 00:11:53,349
WITH THE
PANDEMIC AND EVERYTHING, IT'S
BEEN SO STRESSFUL,

164
00:11:53,349 --> 00:11:56,583
STILL THIS
TIME, BEING WITH YOU AND OUR SON,

165
00:11:56,583 --> 00:11:59,251
THEY HAVE BEEN THE BEST
YEARS OF MY LIFE.

166
00:11:59,251 --> 00:12:01,877
AND HE JUST LOOKED AT ME AND SAID,

167
00:12:01,877 --> 00:12:05,477
I'M GOING TO GO PUT THE
WINDOWS UP IN THE CAR.

168
00:12:07,663 --> 00:12:10,419
YEAH.
MY GUY.

169
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:15,491
ONE OF THE TIMES WE PLAY THE
GAME AUTISM OR JUST A MAN.

170
00:12:18,015 --> 00:12:20,702
I DON'T KNOW.

171
00:12:23,185 --> 00:12:27,102
AND I'LL LEAVE YOU WITH WHAT HE
SAID TO ME RIGHT BEFORE I CAME
ON STAGE TONIGHT.

172
00:12:27,102 --> 00:12:30,607
I SAID, BABE, IS THIS OKAY?

173
00:12:30,607 --> 00:12:34,694
AND HE SAID, WELL, IT'S TOO
LATE.

174
00:12:34,872 --> 00:12:39,234
WE'VE GOT A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU

175
00:12:39,234 --> 00:12:41,876

183
00:13:18,144 --> 00:13:19,048

184
00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:20,921

185

00:18:01,166 --> 00:18:04,825
I ALSO GOT PAID FOR TEN DAYS TO
NEVER LEAVE THE BLANKET.

318
00:18:04,825 --> 00:18:07,595
PLUS I GOT TO TELL PEOPLE ABOUT
IT AT WORK.

319
00:18:07,595 --> 00:18:11,160
IT WAS LIKE I HAD A BAD COLD FOR
THREE DAYS.

320
00:18:11,377 --> 00:18:14,285
>> OF COURSE I HAD TO ISOLATE
FROM MY KIDS

321
00:18:14,285 --> 00:18:16,676
BECAUSE I DIDN'T
WANT TO GET THEM SICK.

322
00:18:16,676 --> 00:18:19,112
>> WHAT DO THEY EAT?

323
00:18:19,711 --> 00:18:23,104
>> I GAVE IT 14 DAYS TO BE EXTRA
SAFE.

324
00:18:23,104 --> 00:18:27,719
>> FOR AN EXTRA FEE, WE'LL KNOCK
OUT THE WI-FI NEAR YOUR HOUSE SO
YOU CAN'T DO ANY ZOOM.

325
00:18:27,719 --> 00:18:30,263
>> OH, WELL, TOO BAD.

326
00:18:30,263 --> 00:18:33,244
>> COVID IS THE PERFECT WAY TO
GET OUT OF JURY DUTY

327
00:18:33,245 --> 00:18:35,313
WEDDING

328
00:18:35,313 --> 00:18:38,478
NEIGHBOR'S
ADULT BAPTISM, AND HUSBAND'S
MURDER TRIAL.

329
00:18:38,478 --> 00:18:41,654
AT THIS POINT, COVID IS A
TEN-DAY CRUISE,

330
00:18:41,654 --> 00:18:43,940
WHICH IS ALSO A
GREAT WAY TO GET COVID.

331
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:45,530
>> COVID ISN'T FOR ANYONE.

332
00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:49,370
THAT'S WHY THERE'S THE NEW
ALWAYS POSITIVE COVID HOME TEST

333
00:18:49,370 --> 00:18:53,402
THAT COME WITH TWO PINK LINES ALREADY
DRAWN.

334
00:18:53,402 --> 00:18:55,175
>> AGAIN?

335
00:18:55,175 --> 00:18:57,407
>> YOU JUST HAD IT A WEEK AGO.

336
00:18:57,407 --> 00:18:59,039
PLEASE DON'T DO THIS TO ME.

337
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:02,759
COVID. BECAUSE SOMETIMES THE ONLY
WAY TO GET MENTALLY HEALTHY

338
00:19:02,813 --> 00:19:04,213
IS
TO GET PHYSICALLY SICK.

339
00:19:04,213 --> 00:19:06,941
>> SURE.
THERE MIGHT BE LONG-TERM MEMORY
PROBLEMS,

340
00:19:06,941 --> 00:19:11,513
BUT THAT MIGHT BE
AMAZING BECAUSE THERE'S SO MUCH
I WANT TO FORGET.

341
00:19:11,513 --> 00:19:13,491
>> MY BRAIN IS ALREADY REALLY
BAD.

342
00:19:13,491 --> 00:19:16,925
BUT IF I DON'T HAVE TO TALK TO
PEOPLE IN A WEEK,

343
00:19:16,925 --> 00:19:18,759
I'LL TAKE THAT
DEAL IN A HORSE BEAT.

344
00:19:18,759 --> 00:19:20,639
>> YOU MEAN HEART BEAT.

345
00:19:20,639 --> 00:19:23,399
>> EITHER WAY, THANKS COVID.

346
00:19:23,399 --> 00:19:24,601
>> THANKS, COVID.

347
00:19:24,602 --> 00:19:25,857
VANKS

348
00:19:25,857 --> 00:19:28,014
>> I THINK I'LL GET COVID AGAIN.

349
00:19:28,014 --> 00:19:29,329
TODAY.

350
00:19:29,329 --> 00:19:33,239
>> COVID, GO AHEAD.
YOU DESERVE A BREAK.

351
00:19:38,229 --> 00:19:39,965
>>> SO WITH THAT SAID,

352
00:19:39,967 --> 00:19:40,917
MR. HUBBARD COULD NOT HAVE BEEN

353
00:19:40,919 --> 00:19:43,246
AT THE SCENE OF THE CRIME.

354
00:19:43,248 --> 00:19:48,068
YOUR WITNESS.

355
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:49,840
>> THANK YOU, COUNSEL.

356
00:19:49,842 --> 00:19:51,349
MOVING ON TO CROSS-EXAMINATION.

357
00:19:51,351 --> 00:19:52,037
>> SO ON THE NIGHT OF YOUR

358
00:19:52,039 --> 00:19:53,841
WIFE'S DISAPPEARANCE, WHAT DID

359
00:19:53,843 --> 00:19:54,530
YOU DO?

360
00:19:54,532 --> 00:19:57,023
>> I CALLED THE POLICE.

361
00:19:57,025 --> 00:19:57,777
>> REALLY?

362
00:19:57,779 --> 00:20:00,074
BECAUSE RECORDS SHOW THAT YOU

363
00:20:00,076 --> 00:20:02,535
DID NOT.

364
00:20:02,537 --> 00:20:02,862
AND IN FACT, THE POLICE DIDN'T

365
00:20:02,864 --> 00:20:03,846
SHOW UP UNTIL YOUR NEIGHBORS

366
00:20:03,848 --> 00:20:04,241
CALLED.

367
00:20:04,243 --> 00:20:06,930
>> OH!

368
00:20:06,932 --> 00:20:08,538
>> UH-HUH.

369
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:12,474
>> AND WHEN THE FORENSIC TEAM

370
00:20:12,476 --> 00:20:13,819
EXAMINED YOUR CLOTHING, THEY

371
00:20:13,821 --> 00:20:16,312
FOUND TRACES OF BLOOD.

372
00:20:16,314 --> 00:20:16,936
>> ORDER IN THE COURT.

373
00:20:16,938 --> 00:20:18,510
WE DON'T NEED ANY VOCAL

374
00:20:18,512 --> 00:20:19,592
REACTIONS FROM THE JURY.

375
00:20:19,594 --> 00:20:21,594
>> FROM US?

376
00:20:21,596 --> 00:20:21,921
>> SORRY.

377
00:20:21,923 --> 00:20:23,529
WE JUST DID NOT EXPECT TRACES OF

378
00:20:23,531 --> 00:20:23,857
BLOOD.

379
00:20:23,859 --> 00:20:25,268
>> PROSECUTION, THE FLOOR IS

380
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:27,334
YOURS.

381
00:20:27,336 --> 00:20:29,368
>> PER THE FORENSIC

382
00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:31,172
INVESTIGATION, THE VICTIM WAS

383
00:20:31,174 --> 00:20:33,107
FOUND WITH MULTIPLE LACERATIONS

384
00:20:33,109 --> 00:20:35,043
TO HER ABDOMEN.

385
00:20:35,045 --> 00:20:36,519
>> OH, MY GOD!

00:20:36,521 --> 00:20:38,651
>> DO WE NEED TO TAKE A RECESS.

387
00:20:38,653 --> 00:20:39,931
>> IT WAS JUST GETTING GOOD.

388

00:20:42,589 --> 00:20:44,720
I'M SHAKING.

GETTING STEPS.

394
00:20:48,101 --> 00:20:49,345
>> ORDER IN THE COURT, OR I WILL

395
00:20:49,347 --> 00:20:51,937
HOLD YOU IN CONTEMPT.

396
00:20:51,939 --> 00:20:53,019
>> WE HEAR THAT.

00:20:53,021 --> 00:20:59,285
>> GUYS, GUYS.

398
00:20:59,287 --> 00:21:00,006
>> KEEP IT DOWN.

WERE AT THE OFFICE ON THE 14th,

403

BUT AS THE DEFENSE WAS SAYING --

404
00:21:09,784 --> 00:21:13,686
I'M SORRY, WHAT ARE YOU GUYS

405

DOING NOW?

809
00:38:56,766 --> 00:38:59,473
HALF THEIRE STAFF

810
00:38:59,473 --> 00:39:03,458
SINCE ELON MUSK TOOK OVER
TWITTER,

811
00:39:03,458 --> 00:39:07,630
USE OF THE N WORD ON
THE SITE HAS REPORTEDLY JUMPED
500%.

812
00:39:07,630 --> 00:39:10,142
IT'S THE BIGGEST INCREASE IN THE
USE OF THE N WORD

813
00:39:10,241 --> 00:39:13,316
SINCE THE LAST
TIME I STUBBED MY TOE.

>> KANYE WEST WAS SUSPENDED FROM
INSTAGRAM AGAIN

815
00:39:21,138 --> 00:39:24,041
FOR POSTING A
DESPAIRING MESSAGE ABOUT JEWISH
PEOPLE.

816
00:39:24,041 --> 00:39:28,460
SEEMS LIKE HE'S DOING THE SAME
THING OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND
EXPECTING DIFFERENT RESULTS,

817
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:31,773
WHICH I'VE HEARD IS THE
DEFINITION OF SOMETHING.

818
00:39:31,773 --> 00:39:35,740
KANYE
HIS BUSINESS DEALS WENT BAD,

819
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:38,046
AND HE JUST STARTED CALLING IT A
JEWISH CONSPIRACY

820
00:39:38,110 --> 00:39:43,396
LIKE WHEN HIS
ALBUMS WENT BAD AND HE STARTED
CALLING IT GOSPEL.

821
00:39:45,994 --> 00:39:48,473
>> TOMORROW IS THE NEW YORK CITY MARATHON,

822

826
00:40:06,032 --> 00:40:10,345
NOW ALL THEY HAVE TO DO IS
LAUNCH SOME CHILDREN TO ASSEMBLE

NEW YORK CITY IS NOW REQUIRING EMPLOYERS

TO DISCLOSE SALARY
RANGES IN ALL JOB LISTINGS.

829
00:40:19,062 --> 00:40:22,731
EMPLOYERS MUST LIST EVERYTHING
RANGING FROM THE TOP SALARY

830

BUDGET CUTS

THEY ARE SCALING
BACK ON ORIGINAL SERIES AND
DOCUMENTARIES.

833
00:40:35,422 --> 00:40:38,160
APPARENTLY THERE WAS A FLAW WITH
THE BUSINESS MODEL

834
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:42,409
OF GIVING
STANLEY TUCCI MILLIONS OF
DOLLARS TO EAT GILATO.

VISITORS TO CARRY FIREARMS.

20 MISSILES INTO THE OCEAN

AND
ALL BECAUSE THE LITTLE MERMAID
IS BLACK.

841
00:41:08,133 --> 00:41:10,894
NOT REAL.

TO TALK ABOUT GAS PRICES AND

862
00:42:41,509 --> 00:42:42,976
DEFINITELY NOT ABORTION.

863

SO YOU ARE A TRUCKER WHO WAS

870
00:42:57,959 --> 00:42:58,658
VERY AFFECTED BY GAS PRICES.

871
00:42:58,660 --> 00:42:58,958
THAT MAKES SENSE TO ME.

872

DADDY ON MY TAIL.

ALL I'M HERE TO TALK ABOUT IS

881
00:43:13,742 --> 00:43:16,976
GAS EVEN THOUGH THE SUPREME

882

COURT SENT ROE V WADE TO THAT

883

BIG PIT STOP IN THE SKY.

00:43:21,816 --> 00:43:22,782
50 YEARS OF PRECEDENT.

00:43:26,788 --> 00:43:29,288
IT SEEMS LIKE MAYBE YOU DO WANT

888
00:43:29,290 --> 00:43:31,190
TO TALK ABOUT ABORTION.

889
00:43:31,192 --> 00:43:32,258

NAME I GAVE YOU.

00:43:39,334 --> 00:43:40,333
I GOT TO BE IN RANCHO KUNKARUMBA

893
00:43:40,335 --> 00:43:41,768
BY NIGHT FALL.

894

895
00:43:43,705 --> 00:43:46,305
>> I'M JUST TRYING TO GET

896
00:43:46,307 --> 00:43:48,041
THROUGH THIS MOMENT, SNOK GAS

897
00:43:48,043 --> 00:43:49,709
PRICES ARE UP, AND FAMILIES ARE

898
00:43:49,711 --> 00:43:51,277
HURTING, BUT THAT'S NOT GOING TO

899
00:43:51,279 --> 00:43:52,979
MAGICALLY DISAPPEAR NO MATTER

900
00:43:52,981 --> 00:43:56,015
WHO YOU VOTE FOR.

901
00:43:56,017 --> 00:43:56,282
WE'RE IN A GLOBAL RECESSION

902
00:43:56,284 --> 00:43:57,450
FUELED BY CORPORATE GREED AND

903
00:43:57,452 --> 00:43:59,719
WAR.

904
00:43:59,721 --> 00:44:01,788
HONK, HONK.

905
00:44:01,790 --> 00:44:03,523
BUT WHAT WILL KEEP DISAPPEARING

906
00:44:03,525 --> 00:44:05,858
IS SAFE ACCESS TO ABORTION.

907
00:44:05,860 --> 00:44:07,560
IT'S NOT REALLY MAGIC BECAUSE

908
00:44:07,562 --> 00:44:08,728
THEY TOLD US THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE

909

DOING IT.

911
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:12,198
BREAKER, BREAKER.

912
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:14,500
I GOT A DOUBLE NICKEL ON THE

913
00:44:14,502 --> 00:44:14,834
FLAB.

914
00:44:14,836 --> 00:44:16,169
>> DID YOU JUST GOOGLE TRUCKER

915
00:44:16,171 --> 00:44:17,537
TERMS?

916
00:44:17,539 --> 00:44:18,137
>> LIKE RESEARCH?

917
00:44:18,139 --> 00:44:19,739
YEAH.

918
00:44:19,741 --> 00:44:22,141
HOLD THAT.

919
00:44:22,143 --> 00:44:23,710
I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT

920
00:44:23,712 --> 00:44:26,546
ABORTION ON LIVE TV OR PEACOCK,

921
00:44:26,548 --> 00:44:27,814
WHATEVER THAT COUNTS AS.

922
00:44:27,816 --> 00:44:30,016
BUT THESE ARE SCARY TIMES, OKAY?

923
00:44:30,018 --> 00:44:34,287
BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO JUST

924
00:44:34,289 --> 00:44:36,089
TAKE AWAY ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE.

925
00:44:36,091 --> 00:44:38,191
THEY WANT TO CRIMINALIZE IT TOO.

926
00:44:38,193 --> 00:44:39,592
IT'S SO BAD, US TRUCK DRIVERS

927
00:44:39,594 --> 00:44:42,495
ARE WARNING EACH OTHER TO DELETE

928
00:44:42,497 --> 00:44:44,597
OUR PERIOD TRACKING APPS.

929
00:44:44,599 --> 00:44:46,699
I JUST WANT TO KNOW WHAT WEEK TO

930
00:44:46,701 --> 00:44:48,568
WEAR MY BAD UNDERWEAR.

931
00:44:48,570 --> 00:44:51,637
BUT I CAN'T BECAUSE SOME DICK

HEAD IN ARIZONA THINKS IT'S

933
00:44:55,677 --> 00:44:56,142
EVIDENCE OF A CRIME.

934
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:01,581
ARUBA!

935

>> I THINK IT'S AROOGA!

936
00:45:04,119 --> 00:45:06,285
>> WHY ARE YOU ON MY ASS?

937
00:45:06,287 --> 00:45:07,587
THE POINT IS, YOU SHOULD BE ABLE

938
00:45:07,589 --> 00:45:08,221
TO SEE A DOCTOR ABOUT YOUR

939
00:45:08,223 --> 00:45:13,726
ANATOMY WITHOUT THEM HAVING TO

940
00:45:13,728 --> 00:45:14,694
CALL THEIR LAWYER FIRST.

941
00:45:14,696 --> 00:45:16,229
BEEP, BEEP.

00:45:16,231 --> 00:45:17,897
CHECK MY REAR.

943
00:45:17,899 --> 00:45:18,197
AM I CLEAR?

944
00:45:18,199 --> 00:45:20,700
IS MY REAR CLEAR?

945
00:45:20,702 --> 00:45:21,601
BEEP.

946
00:45:21,603 --> 00:45:23,069
I'M BACKING UP ABOUT 50 YEARS

947
00:45:23,071 --> 00:45:23,469
INTO THE PAST.

948
00:45:23,471 --> 00:45:25,571
>> I GOT YOU.

949
00:45:25,573 --> 00:45:25,838
I GOT YOU.

950
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:27,340
>> I KNOW THIS WASN'T FUN FOR

951
00:45:27,342 --> 00:45:29,142
YOU.

952
00:45:29,144 --> 00:45:38,117
LET ME GIVE YOU SOME LITTLE

953
00:45:38,119 --> 00:45:38,417
TRUCKER TOYS.

954
00:45:38,419 --> 00:45:38,985
HERE'S A NUDEY MAG, AND HERE'S

955
00:45:38,987 --> 00:45:40,887
THIS.

956
00:45:40,889 --> 00:45:42,855
>> IS THIS GATORADE?

957
00:45:42,857 --> 00:45:44,657
>> IT WAS AT ONE POINT.

958
00:45:44,659 --> 00:45:46,659
TRUTH IS, I HAVE FELT PRETTY

959
00:45:46,661 --> 00:45:48,361
HELPLESS OVER THE PAST YEAR, AND

960
00:45:48,363 --> 00:45:51,164
IT'S HARD TO KNOW WHAT TO SAY TO

961
00:45:51,166 --> 00:45:51,898
MAKE OTHER TRUCKERS FEEL BETTER.

962
00:45:51,900 --> 00:45:53,432
SO HERE'S THE THING I CAN SAY.

963
00:45:53,434 --> 00:45:55,468
THERE'S ONE MOTHER TRUCKING

964
00:45:55,470 --> 00:45:57,236
THING WE CAN DO TO FIGHT FOR

965
00:45:57,238 --> 00:45:58,037
MOTHER TRUCKING FREEDOM TO MAKE

966
00:45:58,039 --> 00:45:58,938
OUR OWN HEALTHCARE DECISIONS,

967
00:45:58,940 --> 00:46:02,842
AND THAT'S VOTE.

968
00:46:02,844 --> 00:46:04,677
AND I HOPE TO HELL EVERYONE

969

>> ALL RIGHT.

1207
00:54:10,765 --> 00:54:11,196
THIS WAS NOT AS INFORMATIVE AS I

1208
00:54:11,198 --> 00:54:11,997
HOPED.

1209
00:54:11,999 --> 00:54:13,866

>> WELL, THERE YOU HAVE IT, AND

1219
00:54:32,119 --> 00:54:35,587
I THINK WE'RE ALL DONE HERE.

00:54:37,625 --> 00:54:38,957
>> SIR, IF I MAY JUST INCLUDE,

1222
00:54:38,959 --> 00:54:40,626
THE TWO OF THEM ARE COUSINS.

1223
00:54:40,628 --> 00:54:40,926
>> YES, I KNOW THAT.

1224
00:54:40,928 --> 00:54:42,261
DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THE

1225
00:54:42,263 --> 00:54:44,630
FIRE.

1226
00:54:44,632 --> 00:54:47,900
>> NO, I DO NOT.

1227
00:54:47,902 --> 00:54:48,500
BUT SINCE HE GOT TO DO A TRICK,

1228

LOOK WHAT I CAN DO.

1229
00:54:50,237 --> 00:54:51,003
>> OKAY.

1230
00:54:51,005 --> 00:54:53,205
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT IS.

1231
00:54:53,207 --> 00:54:54,339
AND I'M NOT REALLY HERE TO LOOK

1232
00:54:54,341 --> 00:54:56,341
AT TRICKS.

1233
00:54:56,343 --> 00:54:58,977
>> HEY.

1234
00:54:58,979 --> 00:55:05,651
HE AIN'T EVEN MY COUSIN.

1235
00:55:05,653 --> 00:55:08,220
HE'S ONLY MY COUSIN BECAUSE HE

1236
00:55:08,222 --> 00:55:09,855
MARRIED MY COUSIN.

1237
00:55:09,857 --> 00:55:10,155
SO, HEY, I CAN STILL GET WITH

00:55:11,559 --> 00:55:13,192
YOU.

1240
00:55:13,194 --> 00:55:14,760
>> NO ONE WANTS TO LAY WITH YOU.

1241
00:55:14,762 --> 00:55:17,996
>> I BET YOU SOMEONE WILL.

1242
00:55:17,998 --> 00:55:18,297
>> NO, THEY WON'T.

1243
00:55:18,299 --> 00:55:19,331
BECAUSE YOU AIN'T GOT IT LIKE

1244
00:55:19,333 --> 00:55:20,833

NO.

1248
00:55:24,371 --> 00:55:26,371
THIS CANNOT HAPPEN.

1249
00:55:26,373 --> 00:55:30,876
IT'S LITERALLY MY FIRST DAY.

1250
00:55:30,878 --> 00:55:31,243
>> OH, SIR, IF I MAY.

1251
00:55:31,245 --> 00:55:32,945
I CAN CLEAR THIS UP 100%.

1252
00:55:32,947 --> 00:55:33,312
JUST --

1253
00:55:33,314 --> 00:55:33,846
>> JUST DON'T SAY THEY'RE

1254
00:55:33,848 --> 00:55:35,013
COUSINS.

1255
00:55:35,015 --> 00:55:38,884
>> EXACTLY.

1256
00:55:38,886 --> 00:55:40,085
THEY ARE COUSINS.

1257
00:55:40,087 --> 00:55:40,385

YEAH.

1260
00:55:44,625 --> 00:55:47,893
NOW I'M UNFORTUNATELY SEEING A

1261
00:55:47,895 --> 00:55:48,460
LOT OF PEOPLE LINED UP, AND I'M

1262
00:55:48,462 --> 00:55:49,595

1263
00:55:49,597 --> 00:55:49,995
ABOUT THE FIRE.

1264
00:55:49,997 --> 00:55:53,665
>> I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT

1265
00:55:53,667 --> 00:55:54,833
THAT, SIR.

1266
00:55:54,835 --> 00:55:56,068
BUT LOOK WHAT I CAN DO.

THE REAL REASON I AM MAD AT HER,

1271
00:56:05,579 --> 00:56:08,981
THE REAL REASON I AM MAD AT YOU

1272

ARE YOU SERIOUS?

1279
00:56:18,125 --> 00:56:20,159
I LIKE YOU.

1280
00:56:20,161 --> 00:56:21,894
I LIKE YOUR SMILE.

1281

1283
00:56:26,033 --> 00:56:27,132
PIZZA, AND I'M SORRY THAT THE

1284
00:56:27,134 --> 00:56:28,734
YEARS HAVE TORN US APART IN TERM

>> SO NOW WHAT?

1287
00:56:31,572 --> 00:56:33,438

KISSING.

1293
