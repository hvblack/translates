Cheers is filmed before a live
studio audience.

00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:03,620
¶ Making your way in
the world today ¶

3
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:06,295
¶ Takes everything you've got.

4
00:01:06,295 --> 00:01:09,455
¶ Taking a break from all your
worries

5
00:01:09,455 --> 00:01:12,564
sure would help a lot ¶

6
00:01:12,564 --> 00:01:16,747
¶ Wouldn't you like
to get away? ¶

7
00:01:18,497 --> 00:01:20,718
¶ Sometimes you want to go

8
00:01:20,718 --> 00:01:24,991
where
everybody knows your name ¶

9
00:01:25,731 --> 00:01:30,242
¶ And they're always
glad you came ¶

10
00:01:30,242 --> 00:01:33,144
¶ You want to be
where you can see ¶

11
00:01:33,178 --> 00:01:35,397
¶ Troubles are all the same.

12
00:01:35,397 --> 00:01:40,737
¶ You want to be where everybody
knows your name ¶

13
00:01:40,737 --> 00:01:43,410
¶ You want to go where people
know

14
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:45,871
people are all the same ¶

15
00:01:45,871 --> 00:01:51,167
¶ You want to go where everybody
knows your name. ¶

16
00:02:08,296 --> 00:02:11,633
So, did you get a chance
to see Carla's babies?

17
00:02:11,667 --> 00:02:14,969
Oh, we sure did.
There are two of the cutest
little guys you've ever seen.

18
00:02:15,003 --> 00:02:17,304
Ah, who do they look like,
Carla or Eddie?

19
00:02:17,339 --> 00:02:20,157
Well, they're twins.
They kind of look
like each other.

20
00:02:22,461 --> 00:02:25,229
What's this? "Carla's Tips."

21
00:02:25,263 --> 00:02:29,033
Yeah, it was Carla's idea.
She does some of her best
thinking in labor.

22
00:02:29,033 --> 00:02:32,737
This is ridiculous.
How does she expect to be tipped
if she's not even here?

23
00:02:32,771 --> 00:02:35,864
Well, actually, she's doing a lot
better than she usually does.

24
00:02:36,742 --> 00:02:38,483
Hello, Samuel. Hey.

25
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:40,344
Well, pardon my appearance,
everybody.

26
00:02:40,378 --> 00:02:42,387
We always do.

27
00:02:42,387 --> 00:02:45,216
Sorry. I was covering for Carla.

28
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:46,968
Oh, hey, you're doing
a fine job.

29
00:02:47,002 --> 00:02:50,968
The reason why I look like
I've been up all night
is because, well,
I've been up all night

30
00:02:50,968 --> 00:02:52,473
reading that little opus.

31
00:02:52,508 --> 00:02:56,112
<i>All right, Lust for Justice.
Yeah, Vera talked me
into reading this.</i>

32
00:02:56,128 --> 00:03:00,164
- Oh, is she a fan?
- No, no. When Vera's talking,
I'll read just about anything.

33
00:03:00,198 --> 00:03:04,035
Yeah. I almost ruptured a disc
delivering those
Book of the Month club copies

34
00:03:04,069 --> 00:03:06,020
and I decided to see
what all the hooha was about.

35
00:03:06,054 --> 00:03:07,104
Yeah, two thumbs up, right?

36
00:03:07,139 --> 00:03:11,042
Oh, yeah. Finest piece of trash
not written by a Junta or Jackie
in modern literature.

37
00:03:11,076 --> 00:03:15,495
Good Lord. Another piece
of salacious mind candy.

38
00:03:15,495 --> 00:03:17,981
God, this is over
600 pages long.

39
00:03:18,016 --> 00:03:20,217
Who could imagine
he'd know this many words?

40
00:03:20,252 --> 00:03:23,274
Yeah, well I checked.
He uses a lot of them twice.

41
00:03:24,789 --> 00:03:27,024
Yeah, well, Frasier,
you want to borrow it then?

42
00:03:27,059 --> 00:03:29,043
No way you'll find me
reading it.

43
00:03:29,077 --> 00:03:32,012
- Just look at these reviews.
- Suit yourself.

44
00:03:32,047 --> 00:03:34,653
"I couldn't put it down."

45
00:03:38,554 --> 00:03:41,055
Cheers.

46
00:03:41,089 --> 00:03:45,129
Oh, yeah, she is.
Miss Howe, Mr. Drake.

47
00:03:45,129 --> 00:03:48,783
Mr. Drake?
I wonder what he's
calling about.

48
00:03:48,783 --> 00:03:50,481
Woody, how did he sound?

49
00:03:50,515 --> 00:03:53,025
Happy, mad, pleasant, annoyed?

50
00:03:53,025 --> 00:03:54,643
Well, he sounds
kind of weird.

51
00:03:54,643 --> 00:03:57,898
Like an old woman with a lisp
and a thick German accent.

52
00:03:57,898 --> 00:04:00,324
Woody, that's his secretary.

53
00:04:00,358 --> 00:04:03,168
Oh, well, then she sounded
pretty happy.

54
00:04:06,614 --> 00:04:09,246
Hey, Anthony, Annie, what's up?

55
00:04:09,246 --> 00:04:12,951
Sam, I'm swallowing
my Tortelli pride

56
00:04:12,951 --> 00:04:16,456
to ask if
I might borrow five bucks.

57
00:04:16,456 --> 00:04:18,761
That was very difficult for him.

58
00:04:18,865 --> 00:04:21,695
Is it okay?
I want to get a present
for my mom and the twins.

59
00:04:21,695 --> 00:04:23,598
Sure.
What are you going to get them?

60
00:04:23,632 --> 00:04:26,719
- Five bucks.
- She'll like that.

61
00:04:27,119 --> 00:04:30,721
Thanks, Sam.
Hey, I don't know when I'll be
able to pay you back.

62
00:04:30,755 --> 00:04:32,928
Job market's
been really bad lately.

63
00:04:32,928 --> 00:04:35,626
I haven't been able to
find a job anywhere.

64
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:39,530
Actually, we have an opening
for a temporary waitress
to sub for your mom.

65
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:42,333
- What do you think?
- Ah, I don't want
to be a waitress.

66
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:44,485
No, I was thinking about her.

67
00:04:44,519 --> 00:04:46,619
No, I don't want my
wife to work.

68
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:49,063
I could do it if I want to.

69
00:04:53,145 --> 00:04:54,878
W-Why don't you two
talk about it.

70
00:04:54,912 --> 00:04:59,509
Of course we will.
Communication is
the cornerstone of our marriage.

71
00:05:04,089 --> 00:05:06,492
Well, well, well. Hey, Normie,

72
00:05:06,492 --> 00:05:10,027
- look who's developed
a lust for justice.
- Yeah.

73
00:05:10,061 --> 00:05:12,463
Do you mind?
Lorenzo is hemorrhaging.

74
00:05:12,463 --> 00:05:13,930
Oh, he dies.

75
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:16,342
Don't tell me. Don't tell me.

76
00:05:16,342 --> 00:05:19,586
Yeah, yeah, that's true.
We don't want to spoil the part
where Monica first comes in.

77
00:05:19,621 --> 00:05:21,752
Were you shocked or what when
she turned out to be a man?

78
00:05:21,752 --> 00:05:22,524
Oh, no, no, I saw...

79
00:05:22,558 --> 00:05:25,655
¶ I wish I was
in the land of cotton ¶
¶ Old times there
are not forgotten ¶

80
00:05:25,655 --> 00:05:28,241
¶ Look away, look away,
look away... ¶

81
00:05:28,241 --> 00:05:31,277
You know, sometimes I like
to play little guessing games.

82
00:05:31,277 --> 00:05:33,948
Do you like to play
little guessing games, guys?

83
00:05:33,948 --> 00:05:35,793
Let's play a little
guessing game.

84
00:05:35,804 --> 00:05:37,955
I just spoke to Mr. Drake

85
00:05:37,955 --> 00:05:42,427
and he suggested that I hire
a young girl he knows
to cover for Carla.

86
00:05:42,461 --> 00:05:46,014
Now, why do you suppose a busy,
important man like Mr. Drake

87
00:05:46,014 --> 00:05:51,350
would take time out of his day
to get a simple cocktail
waitress a job?

88
00:05:51,968 --> 00:05:55,473
Oh, oh, oh. Uh, she's, uh...
Norm.
She's a friend of the family.
Possible.

89
00:05:55,507 --> 00:05:57,725
- He's, uh, paying off a debt.
- I like that.

90
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:00,011
- He feels sorry for her.
- He does have a soft heart.

91
00:06:00,045 --> 00:06:01,199
Maybe she's sleeping with him.

92
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,959
Of course that little tramp
is sleeping with him!

93
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:07,170
Do you think I'm stupid?

94
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:09,861
Is this still part of
the guessing game?
No, no, no.

95
00:06:14,159 --> 00:06:16,727
This is just too perfect.

96
00:06:16,762 --> 00:06:21,062
Evan found a nice little bowl
for his goldfish to swim in.

97
00:06:21,062 --> 00:06:24,751
Safe, out of the reach of
the other executive sharks.

98
00:06:24,786 --> 00:06:27,961
Obviously, he forgot about
the Great White Sammy.

99
00:06:30,112 --> 00:06:34,639
Well, we've reached
a compromise, Sam.
I'm taking the relief
waitress job.

100
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:39,341
- Great.
What's the compromise?
- I'm letting her.

101
00:06:39,341 --> 00:06:44,188
Wait a minute.
I am in charge around here
and it is my responsibility
to hire people,

102
00:06:44,222 --> 00:06:47,357
and I have just be informed
that I am hiring someone else.

103
00:06:49,785 --> 00:06:54,498
They're going through
a tough time right now.
Why don't you let Annie
work just for tips?

104
00:06:54,532 --> 00:06:58,802
Tips?! Yeah.
If I'm gonna work here,
I demand a set salary,

105
00:06:58,837 --> 00:07:04,241
plus tips, plus
two coffee breaks,
plus weekends off.

106
00:07:04,275 --> 00:07:06,026
That is completely
out of the question.

107
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:09,830
- Okay, then I demand
that tip thing.
- It's a deal.

108
00:07:15,196 --> 00:07:19,040
I need a Scotch, rocks,
two white wines and a draft.

109
00:07:19,074 --> 00:07:20,858
Okeydokey.

110
00:07:20,892 --> 00:07:24,161
<i>Come on, corn cob. Arriba.</i>

111
00:07:26,315 --> 00:07:29,299
Boy, I tell ya, Annie's getting
to be a real pro, huh?

112
00:07:29,334 --> 00:07:31,902
Yeah, she's sure rattling off
those drink orders, huh?

113
00:07:31,936 --> 00:07:35,361
That's nothing.
How about the way
she puts me in my place?

114
00:07:37,067 --> 00:07:39,174
Can you believe it?

115
00:07:39,174 --> 00:07:43,280
Her first day on the job and
Evan's little tart is late.

116
00:07:43,314 --> 00:07:47,550
That's because she knows I
can't do anything about it
because her lover boy
is the big boss.

117
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:50,104
Isn't she just
the queen of gall?

118
00:07:50,138 --> 00:07:53,879
Oh, no, that was Charlemagne's
wife, I think.

119
00:07:54,543 --> 00:07:59,162
Well, you know,
if memory serves,
I think her name was Cathy.

120
00:07:59,197 --> 00:08:02,049
Listen, have you ever thought
that you're reading
this whole thing wrong?

121
00:08:02,084 --> 00:08:06,537
That maybe she's just
a four-eyed little geek
that Evan Drake
is trying to help out?

122
00:08:06,571 --> 00:08:10,055
Right. And Cliff is leaving
his brain to science.

123
00:08:10,842 --> 00:08:15,121
- I guess, you're still covering
for Carla, huh?
- Guess again.

124
00:08:15,121 --> 00:08:18,182
Okay, uh, here's
another possibility.

125
00:08:18,216 --> 00:08:21,902
Instead of firing someone,
you send them to the worst
job in the organization.

126
00:08:21,936 --> 00:08:24,469
Usually the poor schlep
just gets fed up and quits.

127
00:08:24,469 --> 00:08:27,324
They've tried that
on me a bunch of times.

128
00:08:27,359 --> 00:08:29,290
Works like a charm.

129
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:31,946
You know, you might be right.

130
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:34,231
She's probably just some
pathetic little dishrag

131
00:08:34,265 --> 00:08:37,585
whose last great hope
is working here at Cheers.

132
00:08:37,585 --> 00:08:40,658
I got to stop
jumping to conclusions.

133
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:44,541
Excuse me. Is Miss Howe here?

134
00:08:44,576 --> 00:08:46,193
Mr. Drake sent me.

135
00:08:46,227 --> 00:08:49,146
Oh, you must be the slut.

136
00:08:50,882 --> 00:08:55,229
- Excuse me?
- Slot. You're here
to fill the slot.

137
00:08:55,229 --> 00:08:57,003
Welcome to Cheers.

138
00:08:57,003 --> 00:09:01,459
- Why don't you just
follow me in to my office
and we'll fill out
your W-4 form.
- Great.

139
00:09:01,493 --> 00:09:04,745
And I'll need a phone number
and a job history,

140
00:09:04,779 --> 00:09:09,299
and a number we can call
in case you meet with some
horrible disfiguring accident.

141
00:09:11,019 --> 00:09:13,585
- Sam?
- What?

142
00:09:13,585 --> 00:09:18,792
Could I ask your opinion as
a passionate macho stud horse?

143
00:09:19,026 --> 00:09:24,030
Sure. I may have to stamp out
the answer with my foot,
but go ahead.

144
00:09:24,065 --> 00:09:28,752
Well, it's bad enough that
Anthony's lost all his ambition
and can't get a job. Right.

145
00:09:28,786 --> 00:09:32,789
But ever since I
started working here,
he's become insanely jealous.

146
00:09:32,824 --> 00:09:35,132
Why am I late?
When am I coming home?

147
00:09:35,132 --> 00:09:37,611
Why am I dressed
like such an ultra-fox?

148
00:09:37,646 --> 00:09:43,456
I mean, if it weren't for
the six times a day we make love
he'd be no fun at all.

149
00:09:44,135 --> 00:09:46,407
Six?

150
00:09:47,105 --> 00:09:50,875
Can't think of anything
that I can do six times a day.

151
00:09:52,627 --> 00:09:54,966
Hit me again. Will you, Sam?

152
00:09:55,525 --> 00:09:59,925
Listen, it's kind of
tough on a husband,
you know, to have his wife
supporting him.

153
00:09:59,925 --> 00:10:03,503
- It's a... It's a pride thing.
- It is a pride thing, Sam.

154
00:10:03,538 --> 00:10:07,141
I remember once when I was out
of work, Vera had to support us.

155
00:10:07,175 --> 00:10:10,961
I tell ya, the day that woman
left to deliver phone books...

156
00:10:12,614 --> 00:10:16,450
The proudest day of my life,
actually.

157
00:10:16,484 --> 00:10:19,086
What do you want me to do?
You want me to talk to him?

158
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,773
- Would you, Sam? Thanks. Yeah.
- Yeah, you're welcome.

159
00:10:22,808 --> 00:10:25,195
Hey, I saw that!

160
00:10:26,545 --> 00:10:31,098
Anthony! I can't believe
you're spying on me.

161
00:10:31,132 --> 00:10:33,834
Suddenly,
everything makes sense.

162
00:10:33,868 --> 00:10:36,494
You're taller than me.

163
00:10:37,005 --> 00:10:40,223
You have a Corvette
instead of a bus pass.

164
00:10:40,258 --> 00:10:43,220
And your hair does
that cool blow-dry thing.

165
00:10:43,962 --> 00:10:46,179
And now you've got my wife.

166
00:10:46,213 --> 00:10:49,516
- Well, aren't you gonna stay
and fight for me?
- What's the use?

167
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:51,518
Hey, Anthony,
come on, now, don't...

168
00:10:51,553 --> 00:10:55,673
Have you ever had to defend
Vera's honor?
Well, no, not per se.

169
00:10:55,707 --> 00:10:59,609
But on more than one occasion
I've held her place in line
while she parked the car.

170
00:11:00,995 --> 00:11:02,729
Could you believe that?

171
00:11:02,764 --> 00:11:05,760
After I gave that man
the best 28 months of my life.

172
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,569
Well, why don't you go
catch up with him
and patch things up.

173
00:11:08,603 --> 00:11:10,704
Forget it. He's a wimp
and he can't get a job.

174
00:11:10,739 --> 00:11:12,790
And his jealousy
is ruining our marriage.

175
00:11:12,824 --> 00:11:18,097
Not to mention that he left
the cap off the toothpaste
for, like, the kajillionth day
in a row.

176
00:11:18,097 --> 00:11:21,348
I had no idea that the
wounds were so deep.

177
00:11:21,383 --> 00:11:25,552
Well, as far as I'm concerned,
he can just go and...

178
00:11:25,587 --> 00:11:30,217
Oh, God!
I've just lost the only man
I've ever loved.

179
00:11:30,217 --> 00:11:32,969
Oh, no, wait. Sit here, will ya?

180
00:11:32,969 --> 00:11:35,412
Listen, he'll come back.
Don't you worry about that.

181
00:11:35,447 --> 00:11:38,306
Now, he's not gonna leave
a beautiful girl like you.

182
00:11:38,306 --> 00:11:42,386
You really think so, Sam?
- Oh, absolutely.
He'll be right back.

183
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:45,614
I mean, do you really
think I'm beautiful?

184
00:12:01,555 --> 00:12:04,964
<i>Hey, anyone see the conclusion
of the White House Murders
last night?</i>

185
00:12:04,964 --> 00:12:07,805
No! Don't say anything.
I've got it on tape.

186
00:12:07,805 --> 00:12:11,496
- Did you believe it was
the vice-president?
- Please!

187
00:12:11,496 --> 00:12:14,700
How about where the First Lady
popped out of a pool
of her own blood

188
00:12:14,735 --> 00:12:16,535
and strangled
the Russian ambassador?

189
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:18,505
No... No...

190
00:12:18,539 --> 00:12:21,035
Yeah, that
was my reaction exactly.

191
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:25,667
Well, thank you, one and all,
for ruining yet
another plot for me.

192
00:12:25,667 --> 00:12:29,749
I'll be off, now,
but before I go...
there's something I'd like
to share with you.

193
00:12:29,783 --> 00:12:34,686
<i>In Citizen Kane. Rosebud
is the name of his sled.</i>

194
00:12:34,686 --> 00:12:38,190
<i>In Murder on the Orient Express,
everyone did it,</i>

195
00:12:38,263 --> 00:12:42,252
<i>and Luke Skywalker's father
is Darth Vader.</i>

196
00:12:44,455 --> 00:12:47,000
Ah, why doesn't the guy tell us
something we don't know, huh?

197
00:12:47,034 --> 00:12:50,163
Darth Vader is Luke's father?

198
00:12:51,269 --> 00:12:54,474
See you soon.
Bye.

199
00:12:54,516 --> 00:12:56,186
"Bye."

200
00:12:56,186 --> 00:12:59,046
How dare she put on
that sweetness and light

201
00:12:59,046 --> 00:13:02,213
when it's so obvious
she's nothing more
than a sordid little harlot.

202
00:13:02,213 --> 00:13:03,935
Hypocrite.

203
00:13:04,335 --> 00:13:07,252
Doing a great job,
Laurie. Keep it up!

204
00:13:07,872 --> 00:13:10,969
- I need a couple of drafts, Sam.
- Okay.

205
00:13:10,969 --> 00:13:14,613
But, oh, you, uh,
You and Anthony
still not talking?

206
00:13:14,613 --> 00:13:18,613
Talking? I can barely stomach
necking with him.

207
00:13:18,613 --> 00:13:21,915
He's a wimp.
Not like my Sam.

208
00:13:21,915 --> 00:13:25,805
Tell me,
how do you feel
about moonlit walks by the beach

209
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:27,717
and dinner by a roaring fire?

210
00:13:27,785 --> 00:13:30,543
I hate them.
I-I can't stand them. Bleah.

211
00:13:30,577 --> 00:13:32,786
Yay! Me, too. No, no, no.

212
00:13:32,786 --> 00:13:36,838
- I was kidding. I love them.
- Too late.

213
00:13:39,328 --> 00:13:45,048
You know, if someone
ran over Laurie
in the parking lot, I bet it
would look like an accident.

214
00:13:45,048 --> 00:13:48,176
- Do you want to make 500 bucks?
- Just, don't...

215
00:13:48,176 --> 00:13:50,392
Listen to yourself.
You're going crazy here.

216
00:13:50,392 --> 00:13:54,214
We both have a problem
with these new waitresses.
Why don't we help
each other out, here?

217
00:13:54,214 --> 00:13:58,014
- Oh, like I scratch your back...?
- And I'll scratch your front.

218
00:13:58,922 --> 00:14:00,416
What do you propose?

219
00:14:00,416 --> 00:14:05,203
Well, all right, uh...
now, we don't know for sure
that Laurie is
Evan Drake's mistress,

220
00:14:05,203 --> 00:14:08,841
so why don't you let a guy
who knows women better than they
know themselves
find out, all right?

221
00:14:08,841 --> 00:14:09,757
Okay.

222
00:14:09,757 --> 00:14:12,518
- Laurie, you got a second here?
- Yeah.

223
00:14:12,552 --> 00:14:17,159
How do you feel about, uh...
moonlit walks on the beach

224
00:14:17,159 --> 00:14:21,754
- with a dinner by a roaring fire?
- Oh, I love those.

225
00:14:21,754 --> 00:14:23,918
Well, would you like to join me?

226
00:14:23,918 --> 00:14:27,374
Oh, no, no, but...
thanks for asking.

227
00:14:30,437 --> 00:14:32,519
She's his mistress.

228
00:14:35,542 --> 00:14:39,512
- How do you know that?
- She turned me down.

229
00:14:39,512 --> 00:14:42,564
That just proves
she has a weak stomach.

230
00:14:42,599 --> 00:14:43,966
I'll handle this myself.

231
00:14:44,029 --> 00:14:47,070
Oh, wait a second.
Wait a minute.
What about my little
problem here, you know?

232
00:14:47,104 --> 00:14:50,073
Sam, I don't have time to handle
some silly little teenage crush.

233
00:14:50,107 --> 00:14:51,942
It is not silly.

234
00:14:55,930 --> 00:15:00,361
Oh, yes, Miss Howe?
- Laurie, my, you are
such a busy little bee.

235
00:15:00,436 --> 00:15:03,895
I bet you just
won't have an ounce
of energy left for
your leisure time.

236
00:15:03,895 --> 00:15:08,058
Oh, that's okay.
I've lots of energy.
I'll bet you do.

237
00:15:08,092 --> 00:15:11,227
You know, you and I
really haven't had
a chance to get
to know each other.

238
00:15:11,261 --> 00:15:13,747
What do you like to do
in your leisure time?

239
00:15:13,781 --> 00:15:16,466
Well, I, uh, I like to read.

240
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:19,852
- In bed?
- Sometimes.

241
00:15:19,887 --> 00:15:21,700
What else do you like to do...

242
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:24,850
- in bed?
- Sleep.

243
00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:28,646
Oh, well.
Let, let's imagine here,

244
00:15:28,646 --> 00:15:31,614
that you are asleep in bed,
and you roll over.

245
00:15:31,648 --> 00:15:32,981
Did you fall on the floor,

246
00:15:33,016 --> 00:15:35,637
or did something
impede your progress?

247
00:15:35,585 --> 00:15:37,668
- Excuse me?
- Oh, nothing.

248
00:15:37,668 --> 00:15:41,473
It's must my warped,
wonderful, wild sense of humor.

249
00:15:42,909 --> 00:15:45,322
By the way,
how do you know Evan Drake?

250
00:15:45,322 --> 00:15:48,057
Well, he's uh... a friend.

251
00:15:48,057 --> 00:15:52,143
Oh. Well, then maybe
you could help me out.
I was gonna buy him a gift.

252
00:15:52,143 --> 00:15:54,086
Perhaps you know
what size he wears

253
00:15:54,121 --> 00:15:56,515
in slacks or shirts
or jockey shorts.

254
00:15:56,515 --> 00:15:59,075
Oh... sure,
but he doesn't wear jockeys.

255
00:15:59,110 --> 00:16:02,943
- He wears boxers.
- Never mind, then.

256
00:16:04,131 --> 00:16:06,957
I'm gonna pop her.
I'm gonna pop her.

257
00:16:06,957 --> 00:16:09,157
<i>I'm gonna pop her
right in the kisser.
I'm gonna pop her!</i>

258
00:16:09,157 --> 00:16:12,113
Pop, pop, pop, pop, pop!

259
00:16:12,848 --> 00:16:17,209
That's good.
Now-Now do, uh, bacon frying.

260
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:27,975
You know, Darth Vader cannot be
Luke Skywalker's father.

261
00:16:28,555 --> 00:16:31,393
They don't have
the same last name.

262
00:16:31,635 --> 00:16:36,358
That's right, Woody.
I'd better call out
the Imperial Guards.

263
00:16:36,763 --> 00:16:39,794
Stop it, Mr. Peterson.
You're scaring me.

264
00:16:43,293 --> 00:16:47,712
You know, Sam,
I was just thinking
about us last night

265
00:16:47,712 --> 00:16:50,501
as I was in the tub
shaving my legs

266
00:16:50,501 --> 00:16:54,015
and pumicing the dead skin
off my knees and elbows

267
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:55,331
and waxing my...

268
00:16:55,365 --> 00:16:57,550
Uh, is-is there a point to this?

269
00:16:57,584 --> 00:17:00,736
Do I have to say it?
Can't you just feel it?

270
00:17:00,771 --> 00:17:02,922
Would you stop that?
This is silly. Now, just...

271
00:17:02,956 --> 00:17:05,452
Of course it's silly,
but love is silly, isn't it?

272
00:17:05,452 --> 00:17:08,432
Romeo and Juliet were silly
in a mad, passionate way.

273
00:17:08,432 --> 00:17:10,347
Are we silly, Sam?
Are we?

274
00:17:10,347 --> 00:17:11,975
Y-You maybe, but I'm not.

275
00:17:11,975 --> 00:17:16,002
Listen, young lady, I happen
to be a very close friend
of your mother-in-law,

276
00:17:16,036 --> 00:17:18,854
and out of respect,
I'm ending this conversation
right now.

277
00:17:18,889 --> 00:17:23,075
You can end the conversation,
Sam,
but you can't end the feeling.

278
00:17:23,109 --> 00:17:26,094
Honey, I'm flattered,
but this is nuts.
I mean, I...

279
00:17:26,129 --> 00:17:28,314
You know, I'm old
enough to be your f...

280
00:17:28,349 --> 00:17:30,381
a youthful uncle, all right?

281
00:17:30,381 --> 00:17:35,138
I mean, when-when...
when I'm 60,
you're-you're gonna be 22.

282
00:17:35,172 --> 00:17:37,639
Oh, my God, that can't be right.

283
00:17:39,644 --> 00:17:45,327
All right, when I'm 60, uh,
well, you'll be looking
pretty good, actually.

284
00:17:45,516 --> 00:17:48,885
so, why don't you
call me when I'm 60?

285
00:17:48,919 --> 00:17:51,283
I can't wait that long.

286
00:17:54,891 --> 00:17:57,590
Hey, knock it off!

287
00:17:58,829 --> 00:18:02,915
All right, you, outside.
You're gonna get
what's coming to you.

288
00:18:02,949 --> 00:18:05,410
I am not going outside
with you, Anthony.

289
00:18:05,410 --> 00:18:07,836
Not you. Her.

290
00:18:07,836 --> 00:18:10,206
I mean, come on.
You're twice as big as me.

291
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:13,083
Hey, but you stay away from her,
if you know what's good for you.

292
00:18:13,083 --> 00:18:14,743
Thank you for the warning.

293
00:18:14,778 --> 00:18:18,280
Come on, Annie. Let's go.
Why should I listen to you?

294
00:18:18,314 --> 00:18:21,146
Because I happen to be the new.

295
00:18:21,146 --> 00:18:25,201
Assistant Night Manager
at Burger Burger Burger.

296
00:18:25,539 --> 00:18:29,808
- You got a job?
- Hey, an important job.

297
00:18:29,808 --> 00:18:33,895
When I tell people
to chop lettuce,
they say, "How high?"

298
00:18:33,930 --> 00:18:37,550
And now, I am telling you,
Missy,

299
00:18:37,584 --> 00:18:39,902
if you don't come with me
this instant,

300
00:18:39,937 --> 00:18:42,708
we're through forever.

301
00:18:42,708 --> 00:18:47,423
I am so totally
turned on right now,
I could spit.

302
00:18:48,729 --> 00:18:52,870
I guess it's true what they say:
Power is the ultimate
aphrodisiac.

303
00:18:52,870 --> 00:18:55,822
A uniform doesn't hurt, either.

304
00:18:55,822 --> 00:19:00,598
- Can you wear it all night?
- Oh, maybe the hat.

305
00:19:01,896 --> 00:19:04,777
Boy, Sam, lucky for you,
he got that job, huh?

306
00:19:04,777 --> 00:19:06,527
Lucky, hell.
I got him that job.

307
00:19:06,527 --> 00:19:10,316
- I traded in a few favors
and got him in.
- Wow.

308
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:15,569
As a matter of fact,
are you interested
in buying a secondhand car
with this giant hamburger
on top?

309
00:19:15,989 --> 00:19:18,457
Five-speed or automatic?

310
00:19:19,326 --> 00:19:22,795
- Uh, Miss Howe?
- Yes, Laurie, dear?

311
00:19:22,795 --> 00:19:26,669
Well, uh,
Mr. Drake is dropping by,
and I was wondering
if I could just

312
00:19:26,669 --> 00:19:29,062
break away
for a... for an early lunch.

313
00:19:29,062 --> 00:19:33,589
Lunch.
Is that the fashionable
term for it these days?

314
00:19:33,623 --> 00:19:36,058
No, I think
I've always called it lunch.

315
00:19:36,093 --> 00:19:39,661
Well, you just run
along with Mr. Drake
to your lunch,

316
00:19:39,696 --> 00:19:43,384
and don't eat so much,
you can't walk back.

317
00:19:45,135 --> 00:19:46,764
Okay.

318
00:19:46,764 --> 00:19:49,493
Excuse me, Sam.
What did she mean by that?

319
00:19:49,493 --> 00:19:52,442
Oh, she's, uh,
under a lot of
pressure nowawdays.

320
00:19:52,442 --> 00:19:56,338
I volunteered
to help her release
some of it, but she...

321
00:19:56,338 --> 00:19:59,734
Probably didn't help,
by asking for an early break.

322
00:19:59,734 --> 00:20:02,291
I better apologize.

323
00:20:02,291 --> 00:20:05,134
Oh,
Normie, do my eyes deceive me,

324
00:20:05,134 --> 00:20:07,944
or is this the start
of girl-fighting season?

325
00:20:07,944 --> 00:20:11,374
Luckily, we have our, uh,
luxury box seats just in time.

326
00:20:11,374 --> 00:20:14,722
That's right.
They cost a little bit more,
but they're worth it.

327
00:20:14,722 --> 00:20:17,533
Miss Howe,
if it's more convenient,
I'll just take my lunch break
one hour...

328
00:20:17,567 --> 00:20:20,919
Listen!
Let's just cut the
crap here, all right?

329
00:20:20,953 --> 00:20:22,755
I know how you got hired here,

330
00:20:22,789 --> 00:20:25,769
and I know what your
relationship is to Mr. Drake.

331
00:20:25,769 --> 00:20:30,871
- You do?
- Well, give me credit
for having an ounce of a brain.

332
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:36,068
You can tell me to go to hell,
but there's something
I have to know.

333
00:20:36,102 --> 00:20:40,100
- Do you love Evan Drake?
- Well, yes.

334
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:44,733
I see.
And does he love you?

335
00:20:44,733 --> 00:20:49,097
- Does he love you?!
- Well, of course he does.

336
00:20:49,097 --> 00:20:51,801
Well, then there's only
one thing left to say.

337
00:20:51,835 --> 00:20:54,442
Oh, my God. Oh!

338
00:20:57,013 --> 00:20:59,752
Oh, damn, it's a knockout.

339
00:20:59,752 --> 00:21:02,108
Didn't even get
to any hair-pulling.

340
00:21:05,882 --> 00:21:07,883
What the hell's going on?

341
00:21:07,917 --> 00:21:09,074
Mr. Drake.

342
00:21:09,074 --> 00:21:10,157
Daddy.

343
00:21:10,157 --> 00:21:11,940
D-Daddy? Daddy?

344
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:14,058
Daddy. Daddy.

345
00:21:16,810 --> 00:21:20,621
- What happened?
- Oh, I think she hit me.

346
00:21:21,231 --> 00:21:24,378
- You hit my daughter?
- No, I'm fine.

347
00:21:24,378 --> 00:21:27,653
Yes, I did,
but it was an accident.

348
00:21:27,687 --> 00:21:29,738
I have a nerve disorder.

349
00:21:29,773 --> 00:21:31,778
- A nerve disorder?
- Yes, she...

350
00:21:31,778 --> 00:21:33,442
Yes. She was dropped
as a child on her...

351
00:21:33,477 --> 00:21:37,196
And-And you better
stand back, because
I just never know
when it's gonna go off.

352
00:21:37,313 --> 00:21:40,299
Aah! See?
I'd better get back
on that medication.

353
00:21:40,333 --> 00:21:41,516
Are you all right, baby?

354
00:21:41,551 --> 00:21:43,748
I'll be all right. Thank you.

355
00:21:47,429 --> 00:21:50,335
- I mean her.
- Yes, Daddy.

356
00:21:50,335 --> 00:21:53,293
- So, uh,
Laurie's your daughter.

357
00:21:53,293 --> 00:21:55,991
Why didn't you tell me, kiddo?

358
00:21:55,991 --> 00:21:58,350
Well, Daddy said not to.

359
00:21:58,384 --> 00:22:00,402
I didn't want her
to have any special treatment.

360
00:22:00,437 --> 00:22:03,672
I want her to know
what it feels like
not to be the boss's daughter.

361
00:22:03,707 --> 00:22:05,973
What a fabulous idea.

362
00:22:05,973 --> 00:22:09,212
And so smart of you not to tell
anyone who she was.

363
00:22:09,212 --> 00:22:11,744
Do you have any cotton
in your office?

364
00:22:11,744 --> 00:22:13,887
Yeah. Let's put some food
in my baby, huh?

365
00:22:13,887 --> 00:22:16,235
Again, again, please
accept my apology,

366
00:22:16,269 --> 00:22:18,752
and it was so nice
to see you, Mr. Drake.

367
00:22:18,752 --> 00:22:23,145
If you don't mind, I'll wait
till after
you've had the medication.

368
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:30,333
Do you think he bought
that nerve disorder thing?

369
00:22:30,333 --> 00:22:32,835
I think he bought
that nerve disorder thing.

370
00:22:32,869 --> 00:22:34,520
Is it getting darker in here?

371
00:22:34,554 --> 00:22:37,758
- Oh, Sam, stop being
such a big baby.
- Yeah, well...

372
00:22:37,758 --> 00:22:40,273
Here, let me look at your nose.

373
00:22:40,794 --> 00:22:44,227
Oh, my God!
What?

374
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:52,089
What-What...?

375
00:22:57,536 --> 00:22:59,428
Hey, everybody, I'm back.

376
00:22:59,462 --> 00:23:01,146
Hey, Carla. All right.

377
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:03,372
Anything new
since I've been gone?

378
00:23:03,372 --> 00:23:07,050
- Mm, no, not much.
- Uh, well, nothing special.

379
00:23:07,050 --> 00:23:09,968
Yeah, yeah. How about yourself?
The usual.

380
00:23:10,989 --> 00:23:30,969
translate
