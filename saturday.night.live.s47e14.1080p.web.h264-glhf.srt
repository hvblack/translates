1
00:00:02,202 --> 00:00:04,922
>>> AND NOW, LIVE FROM MAR-A-LAGO,

2
00:00:04,983 --> 00:00:09,127
IT'S THE "FOX NEWS
UKRAINIAN INVASION CELEBRATION
SPECTACULAR!"

3
00:00:09,127 --> 00:00:13,517
WITH YOUR HOSTS, TUCKER CARLSON
AND LAURA INGRAHAM!

4
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:28,327
>> GOOD EVENING.
I'M TUCKER CARLSON.

5
00:00:28,327 --> 00:00:30,556
I'M LIKE A PAIR OF BOAT SHOES
CAME TO LIFE.

6
00:00:30,556 --> 00:00:32,144
>> AND I'M LAURA INGRAHAM.

7
00:00:32,144 --> 00:00:36,000
AND WHEN I WATCH "HARRY POTTER"
I ROOT FOR VOLDEMORT.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,763
>> WE GOT INTO A LITTLE BIT OF
TROUBLE FOR ALL THE NICE THINGS
WE SAID ABOUT RUSSIA

9
00:00:40,763 --> 00:00:42,738
AND THE
MEAN THING WE SAID ABOUT
UKRAINE.

10
00:00:42,738 --> 00:00:47,002
>> WE DID SOUND PRETTY AWFUL IN
HINDSIGHT.
AND FORESIGHT.

11
00:00:47,002 --> 00:00:49,780
>> I KEPT ASKING WHY DO WE HATE
PUTIN?

12
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:52,341
AREN'T LIBERALS IN AMERICA EVEN
WORSE?

13
00:00:52,341 --> 00:00:55,224
>> AND I CALLED THE PRESIDENT OF
UKRAINE PATHETIC.

14
00:00:55,224 --> 00:00:57,559
HE STAYED AND FOUGHT WITH HIS PEOPLE IN THE WAR

15
00:00:57,559 --> 00:01:00,972
AND I CALLED
HIM PATHETIC FROM A NEWS DESK IN
WASHINGTON.

16
00:01:00,972 --> 00:01:04,425
>> I KEPT SAYING WE SHOULD BE
MORE WORRIED

17
00:01:04,501 --> 00:01:07,174
ABOUT OUR OWN
BORDER GETTING INVADED BY
MEXICO.

18
00:01:07,174 --> 00:01:11,263
BUT IN MY DEFENSE, I AM RACIST.
SO I THOUGHT THAT WAS TRUE.

19
00:01:11,263 --> 00:01:14,378
>> BUT TONIGHT WE'RE GOING TO
MAKE IT UP.

20
00:01:14,378 --> 00:01:17,630
WE'RE RAISING MONEY FOR THE REAL
VICTIMS OF THIS INVASION.

21
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:19,382
THE OLIGARCHS.

22
00:01:19,382 --> 00:01:24,351
BECAUSE WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT
THE BABIES.
THEIR SUGAR BABIES.

23
00:01:24,351 --> 00:01:29,363
WHO WILL POUR VODKA IN THEIR
MOUTHS?
SO MANY HORNY MOUTHS TO FEED.

24
00:01:29,363 --> 00:01:33,139
>> SO PLEASE OPEN YOUR WALLETS
AND BECAUSE THIS IS FOX NEWS

25
00:01:33,139 --> 00:01:36,629
YOU
CAN EITHER SEND MONEY OR TAKE
OUT A REVERSE MORTGAGE.

26
00:01:36,629 --> 00:01:41,089
SO FAR WE'VE RAISED OVER 8.3
BILLION RUBLES,

27
00:01:41,089 --> 00:01:43,808
WHICH COMES OUT
TO ALMOST $12.

28
00:01:43,808 --> 00:01:46,211
>> AND THIS IS INCREDIBLY
EXCITING.

29
00:01:46,211 --> 00:01:50,291
FORMER AND CURRENT PRESIDENT OF
THE UNITED STATES DONALD TRUMP

30
00:01:50,291 --> 00:01:52,791
IS MANNING THE PHONE LINES
HIMSELF.

31
00:01:52,791 --> 00:01:57,305
>> AND THE THING IS ABOUT
RIHANNA, SHE CAN PULL IT OFF.

32
00:01:57,305 --> 00:02:01,441
SHE CAN BE NINE MONTHS.
THE BODY'S STILL INCREDIBLE.

33
00:02:01,441 --> 00:02:03,645
BUT NOW YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A
LOT OF WOMEN

34
00:02:03,645 --> 00:02:07,234
SEEING THIS
RIGHT NOW, 3s, 4s, FRANKLY
TROLLS,

35
00:02:07,234 --> 00:02:09,540
WEARING THE SAME
SEE-THROUGH SHIRT.

36
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:12,105
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
I HESITATE TO SAY WHALES BECAUSE
I KNOW THE WHALES,

37
00:02:12,105 --> 00:02:14,431
I'M VERY
POPULAR WITH THE WHALES.
I DO GREAT WITH WHALES.

38
00:02:14,431 --> 00:02:18,111
THEY COME UP TO ME ON THE BEACH
AND THEY SAY THANK YOU, MR.
PRESIDENT.

39
00:02:18,111 --> 00:02:21,438
YOU KNOW, THE BLOWHOLES BLASTING
AWAY.
200, 300 FEET IN THE AIR.

40
00:02:21,438 --> 00:02:23,471
IT'S HOW THEY SALUTE ME.

41
00:02:23,471 --> 00:02:26,725
>> OKAY.
WE'LL COME BACK TO YOU, MR.
PRESIDENT,

42
00:02:26,725 --> 00:02:30,034
BECAUSE OUR FIRST
GUEST IS HERE.
HE'S A GREAT AMERICAN PATRIOT.

43
00:02:30,034 --> 00:02:33,877
SO GREAT THAT HE LEFT AMERICA
AND BECAME A RUSSIAN CITIZEN.

44
00:02:33,877 --> 00:02:38,020
THE PUFFIEST ACTION STAR IN THE
WORLD, STEVEN SEAGAL.

45
00:02:38,647 --> 00:02:43,198
>> THANK YOU.
THANK YOU, TUCKER.

46
00:02:43,198 --> 00:02:46,636
OH, WHAT A GLOBAL CRISIS WE ARE
FACING.

47
00:02:46,636 --> 00:02:52,221
AS SOMEONE WHO PROUDLY PRETENDS
TO BE BOTH NATIVE AMERICAN AND JAPANESE,

48
00:02:52,221 --> 00:02:54,834
I FEEL FOR ALL PEOPLE.

49
00:02:54,834 --> 00:02:57,440
>> NOW, YOU'RE CLOSE WITH
PRESIDENT PUTIN, RIGHT?

50
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:01,240
>> YES.
PUTIN AND I ARE, AS THEY SAY IN ANCIENT JAPAN,

51
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:03,587
ESKIMO BROTHERS.

52
00:03:03,587 --> 00:03:05,863
SO I WILL BE HONORING PUTIN

53
00:03:05,863 --> 00:03:10,638
BY PERFORMING AN AUTHENTIC
TAEKWONDO EXHIBITION.

54
00:03:14,311 --> 00:03:16,924
NOW IT'S TIME TO HONOR MYSELF

55
00:03:16,924 --> 00:03:20,970
WITH A TRADITIONAL JAPANESE
SHAMROCK SHAKE.

56
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:26,478
THE TRADITIONAL SEASONAL
BEVERAGE OF ALL AIKIDO
EXHIBITIONS.

57
00:03:27,564 --> 00:03:30,314
THANK

58
00:03:31,466 --> 00:03:37,623
>> LET'S CHECK BACK IN WITH THE
MAN WHO SAID PUTIN'S INVASION
WAS VERY SMART

59
00:03:37,623 --> 00:03:41,742
AND ALSO SAID
CHINA SHOULD INVADE TAIWAN NEXT.
MR. PRESIDENT?

60
00:03:41,742 --> 00:03:45,906
>> MY FAVORITE FOOD IS PROBABLY
BREAD.
YOU KNOW?

61
00:03:45,906 --> 00:03:49,305
AND MORE SPECIFICALLY BUN.
I LIKE BUN.

62
00:03:49,305 --> 00:03:52,141
BUN IS GREAT.
ESPECIALLY WITH RESPECT TO
BURGER.

63
00:03:52,141 --> 00:03:55,210
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
BEYOND BURGER.
CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT?

64
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:57,175
I WANT TO STAY RIGHT AT BURGER.

65
00:03:57,175 --> 00:03:59,261
BEYOND IS NOT GOOD.

66
00:03:59,261 --> 00:04:03,600
JOE BIDEN HAS GONE BEYOND BURGER
AND IT HAS NOT GONE SO WELL.

67
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:06,199
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
NEITHER HAS REBOOT OF FRESH
PRINCE.

68
00:04:06,199 --> 00:04:10,828
IT'S VERY DIFFERENT AND I'M
LAUGHING AND I'M LAUGHING BUT I
DON'T KNOW WHY.

69
00:04:10,828 --> 00:04:14,746
>> OKAY.
I DO HEAR A DIAL TONE ON THE
OTHER END OF THAT PHONE.

70
00:04:14,746 --> 00:04:18,195
SO LET'S HEAR WHAT KIND OF

THANK YOU SO MUCH.
I'M SO EXCITED TO BE HERE.

132
00:10:36,548 --> 00:10:39,237
THIS IS MY FIRST TIME HOSTING
SNL.

133
00:10:39,237 --> 00:10:40,985
THANK YOU.

134
00:10:40,985 --> 00:10:45,006
THEY ACTUALLY ASKED ME TO HOST
BACK IN 2015

135
00:10:45,098 --> 00:10:49,240
BUT I SAID "NO, I'M
NOT READY.
I WANT TO WAIT UNTIL AFTER THE
PANDEMIC."

136
00:10:49,302 --> 00:10:52,596
AND THEY WERE LIKE, "WHAT
PANDEMIC?"

137
00:10:52,596 --> 00:10:54,703
MY NAME IS OSCAR ISAAC,

138
00:10:54,703 --> 00:10:58,757
BUT MY FULL NAME IS
OSCAR ISAAC HERNANDEZ ESTRADA.

139
00:10:59,304 --> 00:11:03,500
I SAID TO HOLLYWOOD -- I SAID TO
THEM, "YOU CAN PICK TWO OF THESE
NAMES."

140
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:07,428
GUESS WHAT THEY WENT WITH.
THE WHITE ONES.

141
00:11:07,428 --> 00:11:10,650
I'M HALF GUATEMALAN, HALF CUBAN.

142
00:11:11,146 --> 00:11:16,211
OR AS CASTING DIRECTORS CALL
THAT, "ETHNICALLY AMBIGUOUS."

143
00:11:16,211 --> 00:11:18,316
ACCORDING TO THEM, I CAN PLAY ANYTHING

144
00:11:18,316 --> 00:11:21,898
FROM A PHARAOH TO
TIMOTHEE CHALAMET'S DADDY.

145
00:11:21,898 --> 00:11:26,534
YOU KNOW THAT JOKE, A PRIEST, A
RABBI, AND A MINISTER WALK INTO
A BAR?

146
00:11:26,534 --> 00:11:28,836
YEAH, I COULD PLAY ANYONE IN
THAT JOKE.

147
00:11:28,836 --> 00:11:33,923
BUT I AM EXCITED.
I'M JOINING THE MARVEL UNIVERSE
WITH "MOON KNIGHT."

148
00:11:35,965 --> 00:11:38,821
YOU KNOW, IT'S KIND OF A FULL
CIRCLE MOMENT

149
00:11:38,821 --> 00:11:42,265
SINCE THE FIRST
MOVIE I WAS EVER IN WAS CALLED
THE AVENGER.

150
00:11:42,265 --> 00:11:47,443
NOT "THE AVENGERS," WHICH WAS A
MASSIVE BLOCKBUSTER.
NO, THIS WAS "THE AVENGER,"

151
00:11:47,443 --> 00:11:51,685
WHICH IS A MOVIE THAT I WROTE,
DIRECTED, AND STARRED IN WHEN I
WAS 10 YEARS OLD.

152
00:11:51,781 --> 00:11:55,277
IT WAS SHOT ON LOCATION IN MY
BUDDY BRUCE FERGUSON'S BACK YARD

153
00:11:55,277 --> 00:11:57,213
IN OUR HOMETOWN OF MIAMI,
FLORIDA.

154
00:11:57,213 --> 00:12:00,983
I PLAY A NINJA ASSASSIN TRAINING
TO FIGHT HIS NEMESIS.

155
00:12:00,983 --> 00:12:04,716
AND WE ACTUALLY HAVE A CLIP.
THIS IS REAL, CHECK THIS OUT.

156
00:12:04,716 --> 00:12:07,601
>>  OKAY, THERE'S THE OPENING
TITLE.

157
00:12:07,601 --> 00:12:12,677
AND THERE I AM.
KIND OF LOSING MY BALANCE A
LITTLE BIT.

158
00:12:12,677 --> 00:12:14,399
PERFECT EDITING.

159
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:17,018
AND HERE COMES MY BIG STUNT.

160
00:12:17,018 --> 00:12:19,054
I TRAINED TWO MONTHS FOR THIS.

161
00:12:23,143 --> 00:12:26,382
I MEAN, ARGUABLY BETTER THAN THE
REAL "AVENGERS."

162
00:12:26,382 --> 00:12:29,766
AND I MADE IT FOR HALF THE
BUDGET, ONLY $110 MILLION.

163
00:12:29,766 --> 00:12:31,650
BUT I TOOK IT REALLY SERIOUSLY.

164
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:34,628
MAYBE A LITTLE TOO SERIOUSLY.
LIKE IN THIS SCENE.

165
00:12:34,628 --> 00:12:36,992
OKAY, THERE I AM ACTING MY HEART
OUT.

166
00:12:36,992 --> 00:12:40,003
AND THERE'S MY FRIEND'S DAD
CLEANING THE POOL.

167
00:12:40,003 --> 00:12:42,848
SHOUT-OUT TO MR. FERGUSON,

168
00:12:42,848 --> 00:12:45,301
AND SHOUT-OUT TO MY BUDDY, BRUCE.

169
00:12:45,301 --> 00:12:49,251
HE'S AT HOME WATCHING AND HE HAD
NO IDEA OUR OLD MOVIE WAS GOING
TO BE ON "SNL."

170
00:12:49,251 --> 00:12:52,812
I ACTUALLY HAD TO SIGN A
LICENSING AGREEMENT TO SHOW IT.

171
00:12:52,812 --> 00:12:57,210
THAT'S TRUE.
NBC UNIVERSAL NOW OWNS "THE
AVENGER."

172
00:12:57,210 --> 00:13:00,462
COMING THIS FALL TO PEACOCK!

173
00:13:00,462 --> 00:13:03,700
I'VE GOT ONE MORE CLIP.

174
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:07,347
THIS IS A SCENE I DID WITH
MYSELF WHERE I PLAY BOTH PARTS.

175
00:13:07,347 --> 00:13:10,176
OKAY?
HERE WE GO.

176
00:13:10,176 --> 00:13:12,320
THAT'S ME.
*I DIDN'T MEAN*

177
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:15,827
I'M MY OWN HENCHMAN.
* DO THIS*

178
00:13:18,349 --> 00:13:21,599
NOW WATCH WHAT I DO WITH THE
SWORD.

179
00:13:24,122 --> 00:13:26,868
TOTAL COMMITMENT FROM THE START.

180
00:13:26,868 --> 00:13:30,784
NOW, YOU MIGHT BE ASKING, OSCAR,
WHY DID YOU USE YOUR MONOLOGUE

181
00:13:30,784 --> 00:13:32,375
TO SHOW US THESE OLD HOME
VIDEOS?

182
00:13:32,375 --> 00:13:37,648
AND THE REASON IS IT'S IMPORTANT
TO ENCOURAGE KIDS TO BE WEIRDOS.

183
00:13:37,648 --> 00:13:42,153
BECAUSE EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE

184
00:13:42,153 --> 00:13:47,612
ONE OF THOSE WEIRDOS GROWS UP TO
HOST "SNL."

185
00:13:48,251 --> 00:13:52,962
WE'VE GOT A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU
TONIGHT.
CHARLI XCX IS HERE.

186
00:13:52,962 --> 00:13:55,681
SO STICK AROUND.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

187
00:14:05,045 --> 00:14:10,050
HEREBY PRESENT THE PAW PATROL

188
00:14:05,045 --> 00:14:10,050
WITH THIS MEDAL OF BRAVERY FOR

189
00:14:05,045 --> 00:14:10,050
STOPPING THAT OUT-OF-CONTROL HOT

190
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:15,855
AIR BALLOON.

191
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:15,855
WITH YOU PUPS ON PATROL, OUR

192
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:15,855
CITY IS IN GOOD HANDS.

193
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:23,363
>> DON'T YOU MEAN GOOD PAWS?

194
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:23,363
>> HA HA HA!

195
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:23,363
>> ENOUGH IS ENOUGH.

196
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:27,801
I'M CITY COUNCILMAN

197
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:27,801
HERB TANGIER.

198
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:27,801
MAYOR GOODWAY HAS PUT ALL OUR

199
00:14:27,801 --> 00:14:32,472
LIVES AT RISK WITH HER PAW

200
00:14:27,801 --> 00:14:32,472
PATROL INITIATIVE AND I SAY IT'S

201
00:14:27,801 --> 00:14:32,472
TIME TO VOTE HER OUT.

202
00:14:32,472 --> 00:14:37,744
FACT!

203
00:14:32,472 --> 00:14:37,744
THIS MAN FIRED ALL OF OUR CITY'S

204
00:14:32,472 --> 00:14:37,744
POLICE OFFICERS, FIREFIGHTERS,

205
00:14:37,744 --> 00:14:41,414
AND PARAMEDICS, AND REPLACED

206
00:14:37,744 --> 00:14:41,414
THEM WITH A GROUP OF SIX TALKING

207
00:14:37,744 --> 00:14:41,414
DOGS.

208
00:14:41,414 --> 00:14:43,883
I THINK THAT WAS A BAD IDEA.

209
00:14:41,414 --> 00:14:43,883
AND I'M NOT ALONE.

210
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:50,256
LISTEN TO THESE CONCERNED

211
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:50,256
CITIZENS.

212
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:50,256
>> I WAS EXCITED ABOUT THE PAW

213
00:14:50,256 --> 00:14:54,227
PATROL AT FIRST.

214
00:14:50,256 --> 00:14:54,227
TALKING DOGS WHO KNOW HOW TO FLY

215
00:14:50,256 --> 00:14:54,227
JETS AND DRIVE?

216
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:59,866
GREAT.

217
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:59,866
BUT IT'S BECOME CLEAR THAT SIX

218
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:59,866
DOGS CANNOT PROTECT A CITY

219
00:14:59,866 --> 00:15:05,905
ROUGHLY THE SIZE OF SAN DIEGO.

220
00:14:59,866 --> 00:15:05,905
>> CRIMINALS AND LOW-LIFES ARE

221
00:14:59,866 --> 00:15:05,905
FLOCKING HERE BECAUSE THEY KNOW

222
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:12,212
THERE'S ONLY ONE COP PATROLLING

223
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:12,212
OUR STREETS AND IT'S A DOG!

224
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:12,212
>> AND THERE'S ONLY ONE

225
00:15:12,212 --> 00:15:17,951
FIREFIGHTER, ALSO A DOG.

226
00:15:12,212 --> 00:15:17,951
SO IF THERE'S TWO FIRES AT THE

227
00:15:12,212 --> 00:15:17,951
SAME TIME?

228
00:15:17,951 --> 00:15:24,524
SOMEONE'S GETTING SCREWED, I

229
00:15:17,951 --> 00:15:24,524
GUESS?

230
00:15:17,951 --> 00:15:24,524
WHO IS IN CHARGE OF THIS

231
00:15:24,524 --> 00:15:28,762
ORGANIZATION?

232
00:15:24,524 --> 00:15:28,762
A CHILD?

233
00:15:24,524 --> 00:15:28,762
>> YES!

234
00:15:28,762 --> 00:15:31,698
THE PAW PATROL IS RUN BY A

235
00:15:28,762 --> 00:15:31,698
10-YEAR-OLD BOY NAMED RYDER.

236
00:15:28,762 --> 00:15:31,698
WHO IS THIS KID?

237
00:15:31,698 --> 00:15:36,302
BEATS ME!

238
00:15:31,698 --> 00:15:36,302
AS FAR AS WE CAN TELL, HE HAS NO

239
00:15:31,698 --> 00:15:36,302
PARENTS AND DOESN'T GO TO

240
00:15:36,302 --> 00:15:42,442
SCHOOL.

241
00:15:36,302 --> 00:15:42,442
BUT MAYBE THAT'S FOR THE BEST,

242
00:15:36,302 --> 00:15:42,442
BECAUSE WITH ALL OUR TAX DOLLARS

243
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:46,579
PAYING FOR A LITTLE COCKAPOO'S

244
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:46,579
JET PACK, WE NOW HAVE THE WORST

245
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:46,579
SCHOOLS IN THE STATE.

246
00:15:46,579 --> 00:15:52,352
THIS IS MY 17-YEAR-OLD SON.

247
00:15:46,579 --> 00:15:52,352
HE CAN BARELY READ.

248
00:15:46,579 --> 00:15:52,352
>> I CAN READ, I JUST DON'T KNOW

249
00:15:52,352 --> 00:15:56,389
WHAT SOUND VOWELS MAKE WHEN

250
00:15:52,352 --> 00:15:56,389
THEY'RE NEXT TO OTHER LETTERS IN

251
00:15:52,352 --> 00:15:56,389
A LINE.

252
00:15:56,389 --> 00:16:00,660
>> MAYOR GOODWAY, THIS IS ALL

253
00:15:56,389 --> 00:16:00,660
YOUR FAULT AND YOU NEED TO GO!

254
00:15:56,389 --> 00:16:00,660
>> FACT.

255
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:04,464
OUR CITY'S COVID RESPONSE WAS A

256
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:04,464
NATIONAL DISGRACE.

257
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:04,464
WHY?

258
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:09,269
BECAUSE SIX DOGS WERE IN CHARGE

259
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:09,269
OF IT.

260
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:09,269
>> FACT.

261
00:16:09,269 --> 00:16:16,810
CHASE THE POLICE DOG'S ONLY

262
00:16:09,269 --> 00:16:16,810
WEAPON IS A NET.

263
00:16:09,269 --> 00:16:16,810
QUESTION, HOW IS A NET GOING TO

264
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:24,150
HELP IF A LUNATIC ON BATH SALTS

265
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:24,150
IS EATING MY FACE?

266
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:24,150
ANSWER?

267
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:30,256
IT WON'T.

268
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:30,256
>> FACT, MARSHALL THE FIRE DOG

269
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:30,256
IS MY FAVORITE ONE.

270
00:16:30,256 --> 00:16:35,428
HE'S THE FUNNIEST PUP BY FAR AND

271
00:16:30,256 --> 00:16:35,428
THE COOLEST BY A MILE.

272
00:16:30,256 --> 00:16:35,428
BUT I DON'T THINK HE COULD CARRY

273
00:16:35,428 --> 00:16:42,702
ME DOWN A FLIGHT OF STAIRS

274
00:16:35,428 --> 00:16:42,702
BECAUSE HE AIN'T GOT NO HANDS.

275
00:16:35,428 --> 00:16:42,702
>> FACT, I ALSO LIKE MARSHALL

276
00:16:42,702 --> 00:16:45,905
THE BEST.

277
00:16:42,702 --> 00:16:45,905
HE'S SUPER BRAVE AND HIS JOKES

278
00:16:42,702 --> 00:16:45,905
NEVER MISS.

279
00:16:45,905 --> 00:16:52,345
BUT DO WE FEEL SAFE?

280
00:16:45,905 --> 00:16:52,345
NO!

281
00:16:45,905 --> 00:16:52,345
LISTEN TO THIS ACTUAL 911 CALL.

282
00:16:52,345 --> 00:16:55,515
>> PAW PATROL ARE READY TO ROLL,

283
00:16:52,345 --> 00:16:55,515
THIS IS RYDER, WHAT'S YOUR

284
00:16:52,345 --> 00:16:55,515
EMERGENCY?

285
00:16:55,515 --> 00:17:00,353
>> MY GIRLFRIEND, MAN.

286
00:16:55,515 --> 00:17:00,353
SHE'S NOT WAKING UP!

287
00:16:55,515 --> 00:17:00,353
HER EYES ARE, LIKE, ROLLED BACK.

288
00:17:00,353 --> 00:17:06,760
I THINK SHE'S OD'ing, MAN.

289
00:17:00,353 --> 00:17:06,760
>> UM -- PLEASE HOLD.

290
00:17:00,353 --> 00:17:06,760
* PAW PATROL *

291
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:10,230
>> UNACCEPTABLE!

292
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:10,230
AND THAT'S NOT THE ONLY

293
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:14,701
EMERGENCY THAT PAW PATROL'S

294
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:14,701
BUNGLED.

295
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:14,701
JUST ASK MY SISTER.

296
00:17:14,701 --> 00:17:19,039
>> I WENT INTO LABOR EARLY.

297
00:17:14,701 --> 00:17:19,039
I WAS ALONE AND CALLED 911 FOR

298
00:17:14,701 --> 00:17:19,039
HELP AND TOLD THEM MY WATER

299
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:25,478
BROKE.

300
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:25,478
SO THEY SENT ZUMA, THE WATER

301
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:25,478
RESCUE DOG.

302
00:17:25,478 --> 00:17:29,883
HE DIDN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS

303
00:17:25,478 --> 00:17:29,883
HAPPENING AND SAT THERE CHEWING

304
00:17:25,478 --> 00:17:29,883
ON HIS UPPER BUTT WHILE I GAVE

305
00:17:29,883 --> 00:17:37,424
BIRTH ON MY KITCHEN FLOOR.

306
00:17:29,883 --> 00:17:37,424
>> DISGRACEFUL!

307
00:17:29,883 --> 00:17:37,424

00:24:08,081 --> 00:24:10,784
>> I WOULD SAY THAT'S

472
00:24:08,081 --> 00:24:10,784
INAPPROPRIATE.

473
00:24:10,784 --> 00:24:16,122
>> WRONG.

474
00:24:10,784 --> 00:24:16,122
>> HM.

475
00:24:10,784 --> 00:24:16,122
LET'S TRY ANOTHER ONE.

476
00:24:16,122 --> 00:24:19,359
OKAY, SO WHAT IF DONALD SAID TO

477
00:24:16,122 --> 00:24:19,359
MARIA, "WOW, HOW OFTEN ARE YOU

478
00:24:16,122 --> 00:24:19,359
GOING TO THE GYM?

479
00:24:19,359 --> 00:24:23,663
YOUR BODY IS SERIOUSLY

480
00:24:19,359 --> 00:24:23,663
FANTASTIC."

481
00:24:19,359 --> 00:24:23,663
>> THAT'S VERY INAPPROPRIATE.

482
00:24:23,663 --> 00:24:30,136
>> SORRY, NO.

483
00:24:23,663 --> 00:24:30,136
>> TRY TO REALLY FOCUS THIS

484
00:24:23,663 --> 00:24:30,136
TIME.

485
00:24:30,136 --> 00:24:35,642
MARIA COMES UP BEHIND DONALD AND

486
00:24:30,136 --> 00:24:35,642
SAYS, "DAMN, DO YOU LIVE AT THE

487
00:24:30,136 --> 00:24:35,642
GYM OR SOMETHING?

488
00:24:35,642 --> 00:24:41,081
BECAUSE THAT JUICY BOOTY SLAPS."

489
00:24:35,642 --> 00:24:41,081
>> WILDLY INAPPROPRIATE.

490
00:24:35,642 --> 00:24:41,081
>> ACTUALLY, IT'S NOT.

491
00:24:41,081 --> 00:24:47,087
BECAUSE I'M HER BOSS.

492
00:24:41,081 --> 00:24:47,087
>> SEE?

493
00:24:41,081 --> 00:24:47,087
TRY TO REALLY LISTEN, GUYS.

494
00:24:47,087 --> 00:24:52,258
>> OKAY, WHAT IF MARIA'S BOSS

495
00:24:47,087 --> 00:24:52,258
SAID TO MARIA, "HEY, WHEN ARE

496
00:24:47,087 --> 00:24:52,258
YOU GOING TO GET TO START

497
00:24:52,258 --> 00:24:58,798
BANGING OUT KIDS?

498
00:24:52,258 --> 00:24:58,798
THAT IS CLOCK IS TICKING, BABY."

499
00:24:52,258 --> 00:24:58,798
>> AGAIN, VERY INAPPROPRIATE.

500
00:24:58,798 --> 00:25:05,105
>> BUT WHAT IF MY BOSS IS MY

501
00:24:58,798 --> 00:25:05,105
GRANDFATHER AND HE JUST REALLY

502
00:24:58,798 --> 00:25:05,105
WANTS GRANDKIDS?

503
00:25:05,105 --> 00:25:07,907
>> OKAY, BUT HE SHOULDN'T SAY IT

504
00:25:05,105 --> 00:25:07,907
AT WORK IN FRONT OF OTHER

505
00:25:05,105 --> 00:25:07,907
PEOPLE.

506
00:25:07,907 --> 00:25:16,549
>> AND WAIT, I THOUGHT DONALD

507
00:25:07,907 --> 00:25:16,549
WAS YOUR BOSS.

508
00:25:07,907 --> 00:25:16,549
>> "I THOUGHT DONALD WAS" -- YOU

509
00:25:16,549 --> 00:25:20,520
KNOW WHAT?

510
00:25:16,549 --> 00:25:20,520
THIS ISN'T A GAME, DEBORAH.

511
00:25:16,549 --> 00:25:20,520
NEXT SLIDE.

512
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:22,655
>> DONALD SAYS TO MARIA, "HEY,

513
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:22,655
N-WORD, ARE YOU GOING TO THE GYM

514
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:22,655
LATER?

515
00:25:22,655 --> 00:25:26,326
OR AM I GOING TO HAVE TO DRAG

516
00:25:22,655 --> 00:25:26,326
YOUR THICK ASS THERE MYSELF?"

517
00:25:22,655 --> 00:25:26,326
>> THAT'S REALLY AWFUL AND

518
00:25:26,326 --> 00:25:30,897
INAPPROPRIATE.

519
00:25:26,326 --> 00:25:30,897
>> ACTUALLY, IT'S FINE.

520
00:25:26,326 --> 00:25:30,897
>> ACTUALLY, IT'S NOT.

521
00:25:30,897 --> 00:25:36,069
>> NO, HE DIDN'T MEAN THAT "N"

522
00:25:30,897 --> 00:25:36,069
WORD.

523
00:25:30,897 --> 00:25:36,069
HE MEANT NICE.

524
00:25:36,069 --> 00:25:42,175
>> HE WAS SAYING, HEY NICE?

525
00:25:36,069 --> 00:25:42,175
>> YEAH.

526
00:25:36,069 --> 00:25:42,175
BECAUSE HE'S ITALIAN.

527
00:25:42,175 --> 00:25:45,679
HE SAID, "HEYA NICE."

528
00:25:42,175 --> 00:25:45,679
ALL THE TIME.

529
00:25:42,175 --> 00:25:45,679
>> THAT'S ALSO INAPPROPRIATE.

530
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:52,385
>> NOT IF SHE IS MY BOSS.

531
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:52,385
>> ALSO, WHY ARE ALL OF THESE

532
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:52,385
EXAMPLES ABOUT THE TWO OF YOU?

533
00:25:52,385 --> 00:25:59,793
>> WOW.

534
00:25:52,385 --> 00:25:59,793
>> THE TWO OF US?

535
00:25:52,385 --> 00:25:59,793
THAT'S HOW YOU SEE IT?

536
00:25:59,793 --> 00:26:03,496
>> WOW, SO YOU SEE A MAN AND A

537
00:25:59,793 --> 00:26:03,496
WOMAN WORKING TOGETHER, SO

538
00:25:59,793 --> 00:26:03,496
AUTOMATICALLY YOU THINK THEY'RE

539
00:26:03,496 --> 00:26:08,868
HAVING RAW INTERCOURSE?

540
00:26:03,496 --> 00:26:08,868
>> NO ONE SAID THAT.

541
00:26:03,496 --> 00:26:08,868
>> YOU SEE A WOMAN IN A HOT

542
00:26:08,868 --> 00:26:24,417
SKIRT SUIT, NOTHING UNDERNEATH,

543
00:26:08,868 --> 00:26:24,417
AND JUST BECAUSE YOUR EYES ARE

544
00:26:08,868 --> 00:26:24,417
GOING OWOOGA THINKING SHE'LL

545
00:26:24,417 --> 00:26:30,857
TAKE A BITE OUT OF HER BOSS'S

546
00:26:24,417 --> 00:26:30,857
SANDWICH, THAT MEANS

547
00:26:24,417 --> 00:26:30,857
AUTOMATICALLY THEY'RE GOING TO

548
00:26:30,857 --> 00:26:33,560
HAVE RAW INTERCOURSE.

549
00:26:30,857 --> 00:26:33,560
>> STOP SAYING RAW INTERCOURSE!

550
00:26:30,857 --> 00:26:33,560
>> NO, SHUT UP, DEBORAH, SHUT

551
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:35,261
UP.

552
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:35,261
KEVIN WAS RIGHT ABOUT WHAT HE

553
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:35,261
SAID DURING THE INVESTIGATION,

554
00:26:35,261 --> 00:26:38,665
YOU ARE AN UPTIGHT BITCH.

555
00:26:35,261 --> 00:26:38,665
>> OH MY GOD, THIS IS HORRIBLE.

556
00:26:35,261 --> 00:26:38,665
>> EXACTLY.

557
00:26:38,665 --> 00:26:44,838
>> YOU HEAR THAT?

558
00:26:38,665 --> 00:26:44,838
THAT'S CLAPPING.

559
00:26:38,665 --> 00:26:44,838
>> WE'RE CLAPPING FOR YOU!

560
00:26:44,838 --> 00:26:48,141
BECAUSE WE'RE NOT YOUR HR

561
00:26:44,838 --> 00:26:48,141
REPRESENTATIVES.

562
00:26:44,838 --> 00:26:48,141
>> NO.

563
00:26:48,141 --> 00:26:52,078
WE'RE FROM A GROUP CALLED "IT

564
00:26:48,141 --> 00:26:52,078
COULD BE WORSE."

565
00:26:48,141 --> 00:26:52,078
AND WE SHOW EMPLOYEES THAT NO

566

ENVIRONMENT MIGHT BE, IT COULD

568
00:26:52,078 --> 00:26:55,548
BE WORSE.

569
00:26:55,548 --> 00:27:02,555
>> COULD BE WAY WORSE.

570
00:26:55,548 --> 00:27:02,555
OKAY?

571
00:26:55,548 --> 00:27:02,555
>> WHAT ARE WE SUPPOSED TO DO

572
00:27:02,555 --> 00:27:09,329
WITH THIS INFORMATION?

573
00:27:02,555 --> 00:27:09,329
>> I WANT YOU ALL TO WALK BACK

574
00:27:02,555 --> 00:27:09,329
INTO YOUR OFFICES, TAKE A DEEP

575
00:27:09,329 --> 00:27:12,032
BREATH, JUST START TYPING.

AND RIGHT WHEN YOU'RE FINISHED

582

WIVES, AND I WANT YOU TO THINK

ABOUT US.

AND HOW WE SHOWED YOU A NEW WAY

589
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:31,317
TO WORK.

590

**

591
00:27:31,317 --> 00:27:36,089
A NEW WAY TO LIVE.

592
00:27:31,317 --> 00:27:36,089
MAYBE EVEN A NEW WAY TO LOVE.

593
00:27:36,089 --> 00:27:39,426
>> YOU'LL WONDER, WHATEVER

594
00:27:36,089 --> 00:27:39,426
HAPPENED TO THOSE TWO?

595
00:27:36,089 --> 00:27:39,426
DID THEY END UP GOING TO THE

596
00:27:39,426 --> 00:27:44,364
MEN'S ROOM AND HAVING RAW

597
00:27:39,426 --> 00:27:44,364
INTERCOURSE?

598
00:27:39,426 --> 00:27:44,364
>> AND THE ANSWER IS --

599
00:27:44,364 --> 00:27:51,905
YES.

600
00:27:44,364 --> 00:27:51,905
YES, THEY DID.

601
00:27:44,364 --> 00:27:51,905

606
00:27:56,576 --> 00:28:01,014
ONLY ON THE WEATHER CHANNEL.

607
00:28:04,117 --> 00:28:07,821
GRAD SCHOOL?

608
00:28:04,117 --> 00:28:07,821
AMAZING.

609
00:28:04,117 --> 00:28:07,821
>> YEAH.

610
00:28:07,821 --> 00:28:11,591
YOU KNOW, I HAD A GREAT TIME

611
00:28:07,821 --> 00:28:11,591
TONIGHT.

612
00:28:07,821 --> 00:28:11,591
>> ME TOO.

613
00:28:11,591 --> 00:28:15,328
WE'VE HAD THREE INCREDIBLE

614
00:28:11,591 --> 00:28:15,328
DATES.

615
00:28:11,591 --> 00:28:15,328
>> YEAH.

616
00:28:15,328 --> 00:28:19,366
DEFINITELY.

617
00:28:15,328 --> 00:28:19,366
HEY, UM, CAN I ASK SOMETHING?

618
00:28:15,328 --> 00:28:19,366
>> ANYTHING.

619
00:28:19,366 --> 00:28:26,039
>> WHY DO YOU ALWAYS WEAR THAT

620
00:28:19,366 --> 00:28:26,039
GREEN RIBBON AROUND YOUR NECK?

621
00:28:19,366 --> 00:28:26,039
>> UM, WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

622
00:28:26,039 --> 00:28:32,345
>> I'VE JUST NEVER SEEN YOU

623
00:28:26,039 --> 00:28:32,345
WITHOUT IT.

624
00:28:26,039 --> 00:28:32,345
WHY DON'T YOU TAKE IT OFF?

625
00:28:32,345 --> 00:28:36,483
>> I HOPED YOU WOULDN'T NOTICE.

626
00:28:32,345 --> 00:28:36,483
LOOK, ALAN, I'LL SHOW YOU.

627
00:28:32,345 --> 00:28:36,483
BUT PLEASE DON'T LET IT AFFECT

628
00:28:36,483 --> 00:28:44,190
THE WAY YOU SEE ME.

629
00:28:36,483 --> 00:28:44,190

630
00:28:36,483 --> 00:28:44,190
>> ALL RIGHT, HERE WE GO.

631
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:49,963

NOW YOU KNOW.

634
00:28:49,963 --> 00:28:53,933
THERE'S A LITTLE MEATBALL GUY ON

635
00:28:49,963 --> 00:28:53,933
THE SIDE OF MY NECK.

636
00:28:53,933 --> 00:29:00,106
EVERY I TAKE THE GREEN RIBBON

637
00:28:53,933 --> 00:29:00,106
OFF AND EXPOSE HIM TO LIGHT, HE

638
00:28:53,933 --> 00:29:00,106
WAKES UP AND SINGS HIS LITTLE

639
00:29:00,106 --> 00:29:03,343
SONGS.

640
00:29:00,106 --> 00:29:03,343

SO ACTUALLY, I FEEL LIKE THERE'S
BEEN A MISUNDERSTANDING.

890
00:39:44,903 --> 00:39:50,671
THE LAW ACTUALLY MEANS THAT YOU
CAN'T ACKNOWLEDGE THAT GAY
EXISTS AT ALL.

>> WHAT?

LIKE TEACHERS CAN'T SPEAK ABOUT
GAY PEOPLE IN HISTORY.

00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:02,189
OR IF A KID HAS A GAY FAMILY
MEMBER.

894
00:40:02,189 --> 00:40:04,266
>> WHAT?

895
00:40:04,266 --> 00:40:07,304
>> YEAH, AND IF A KID CONFIDES
THAT THEY'RE GAY TO A TEACHER,

896
00:40:07,304 --> 00:40:10,293
THE TEACHER HAS TO OUT THEM TO
THEIR PARENTS.

YOU.

YOU WERE GOING TO SAY.

OKAY.
THAT'S OKAY.

901
00:40:20,410 --> 00:40:23,927
I'LL SAY SOMETHING.
IT'S JUST THAT THING OF LIKE

SORRY, DEPRESSED AND SUICIDAL.

907
00:40:42,642 --> 00:40:46,079

A PURPOSE?

QUESTIONS THAT PARENTS DON'T

919
00:40:59,359 --> 00:41:03,396
WANT TO ANSWER?

920
00:40:59,359 --> 00:41:03,396

927

CONFUSED THEN.

928

929

BE MORE CONFUSING.

1103
00:46:58,618 --> 00:47:02,555

I SAID LET'S USE PROTECTION.

1107
00:47:02,555 --> 00:47:08,495
AND YOU LOOKED ME IN THE EYE AND

1108
00:47:08,495 --> 00:47:13,133
SAID "IT DON'T FEEL THE SAME."

1109
00:47:08,495 --> 00:47:13,133
>> THAT DOES SOUND LIKE ME, YES.

1110
00:47:13,133 --> 00:47:16,903
>> ALL RIGHT, YOU KNOW, I'VE GOT

AIDY

1123
00:47:33,998 --> 00:47:37,554
YOU KNOW, OVER MY TEN YEARS ON
THE SHOW, I HAVE PLAYED DOZENS

1124
00:47:37,554 --> 00:47:40,237

WOMEN NAMED DIANE,
SUSAN, OR TEACHER.

1126
00:47:43,457 --> 00:47:47,079
AND I HAVE LOVED ALL OF THESE
SWEET, NURTURING WOMEN.

1127
00:47:47,079 --> 00:47:51,173
BUT THE SHOW SAID THAT IF I
PLAYED 150 OF THEM,

1128
00:47:51,173 --> 00:47:54,875
THEN AS A
REWARD I COULD WRITE A SKETCH OF
MY OWN CHOOSING.

1129
00:47:54,875 --> 00:47:57,545
YOU KNOW, TO SHOW A DIFFERENT
SIDE OF MYSELF.

1130
00:47:57,545 --> 00:48:00,952

1133
00:48:05,828 --> 00:48:09,944
I CAN'T BELIEVE SIEGFRIED'S GOING TO
TAKE ME, A LOSER AND A FOOL.

1134
00:48:10,014 --> 00:48:13,332
HOW DO I LOOK?
>> YOU LOOK FANTASTIC, SIR.
I'M SURE SHE'LL BE TITILLATED.

1135
00:48:13,332 --> 00:48:17,715
>> BUT YOU'RE RIGHT TO BE
SCARED.
SHE IS THE MOST WIDELY DESIRED
WOMAN IN THE WORLD.

1136
00:48:17,715 --> 00:48:22,124
>> OH, I'M SICK.
I'M SICK WITH FEELING FOR THIS
WOMAN.

1137
00:48:22,124 --> 00:48:25,440
IT'S HER.
PRAY FOR ME BOYS.

1138
00:48:26,030 --> 00:48:28,776
>> HELLO.

1139
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:35,139
NOW, SCRAM, BOYS, AND LEAVE THIS
MAN TO ME.

1140
00:48:35,139 --> 00:48:40,542
>> MY GOD.
YOU ARE SO BEAUTIFUL.
AND SEXUAL.

1141
00:48:40,542 --> 00:48:43,944
AND I CAN TELL YOUR
PERSONALITY'S ALSO REALLY GOOD.

1142
00:48:43,944 --> 00:48:49,094
>> OH GOD, IF I HAD A NICKEL FOR
EVERY TIME I HEARD A MAN SAY THAT,

1143
00:48:49,094 --> 00:48:52,748
I WOULD HAVE SO MANY COINS
THAT IT WOULD BE ANNOYING.

1144
00:48:52,748 --> 00:48:57,298
>> OH, SENSUAL WOMAN.
YOU MAKE ME SO HORNY.

1145
00:48:57,298 --> 00:49:03,306
I SEE WHY THEY CALL YOU THE
SEXUAL WOMAN.

1146
00:49:03,306 --> 00:49:07,159
>> SO YEAH, I LIED TO
OSCAR ISAAC.

1147
00:49:07,159 --> 00:49:12,311
I TOLD HIM I HAVE A FAMOUS
RECURRING CHARACTER ON THE SHOW
CALLED "THE SEXUAL WOMAN."

1148
00:49:12,311 --> 00:49:14,707
IS THAT A CRIME?

1149
00:49:16,981 --> 00:49:21,489
>> OH, I'M THE LUCKIEST MAN ON
EARTH TO BE BRUSHING YOUR HAIR.

1150
00:49:21,489 --> 00:49:23,990
MIND IF I GET A LITTLE CLOSER?

1151
00:49:23,990 --> 00:49:28,211
>> OH, SURE.
BRING YOUR HEAD AND BODY THAT
LOOK LIKE THAT CLOSER TO ME,

1152
00:49:28,211 --> 00:49:29,580
WHATEVER.
I DON'T CARE.

1153
00:49:29,580 --> 00:49:33,741
>> I NEED YOU TO KNOW, I SEE YOU
SEXUALLY.

1154
00:49:33,741 --> 00:49:37,476
I DON'T SEE YOU AS SOMEONE WHO
WOULD, LIKE, RUN A SCHOOL.

1155
00:49:37,565 --> 00:49:43,017
I MEAN, YOU ARE THE MOST UNDER
35 PERSON I'VE EVER MET.

1156
00:49:43,017 --> 00:49:45,115
>> OH, STOP IT, YOU FLIRT.

1157
00:49:45,115 --> 00:49:49,752
>> WELL, I BET YOU WERE ABOUT TO
DO YOUR BIG CATCHPHRASE.

1158
00:49:49,752 --> 00:49:52,681
>> UH -- OH, RIGHT.
YES.

1159
00:49:52,681 --> 00:49:55,422
MY FAMOUS CATCHPHRASE.
OF COURSE.

1160
00:49:55,422 --> 00:49:58,456
WHAT WAS IT?
HERE WE GO.

1161
00:49:58,529 --> 00:50:03,543
HEY, GET YOUR FAT ASS ON MY LAP,
BITCH!

1162
00:50:03,543 --> 00:50:07,810
>> OKAY.
YES.
>> COME ON.

1163
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:16,568
>> I MUST CONFESS, I HAVE A BIG
COOL BONER RIGHT NOW

1164
00:50:16,568 --> 00:50:21,389
WHICH I
SOMETIMES GET WHEN I RESPECT
SOMEONE TOO MUCH.

1165
00:50:21,602 --> 00:50:25,911
>> NOW, WHY DID I CHOOSE
OSCAR ISAAC FOR THE SKETCH?

1166
00:50:25,911 --> 00:50:27,943
NO REASON.
I MEAN, PRETTY RANDOM.

1167
00:50:27,943 --> 00:50:32,867
EVERY TIME I'VE DONE SOMETHING
ROMANTIC ON THE SHOW, IT'S BEEN
TOTALLY RANDOM.

1168
00:50:32,867 --> 00:50:35,333
LIKE WITH RYAN GOSLING.

1169
00:50:35,333 --> 00:50:37,758
OR DRAKE.

1170
00:50:37,758 --> 00:50:41,856
OH, MY GOD.
DO I HAVE A PATTERN OF SEXUAL
RANDOMNESS?

1171
00:50:41,856 --> 00:50:44,142
WELL, WHATEVER.
YOU ONLY LIVE ONCE.

1172
00:50:44,142 --> 00:50:46,545
NOW BACK TO THE SKETCH.

1173
00:50:47,125 --> 00:50:51,837
>> IS THE FOOD ALL RIGHT?
I HOPE YOU EVEN LIKE SPAGHETTI.

1174
00:50:51,837 --> 00:50:53,957
>> YOU'RE LUCKY THAT I DO.

1175
00:50:53,957 --> 00:50:58,319
>> DAMN IT, I'M IN LOVE WITH YOU
AND IT'S KILLING ME!

1176
00:50:58,603 --> 00:51:01,659
YES.
TO ME THIS IS NORMAL BEHAVIOR.

1177
00:51:01,659 --> 00:51:06,319
>> I WROTE A SONG FOR YOU, IF
THAT'S OKAY.

1178
00:51:09,097 --> 00:51:14,495
* SEXUAL WOMAN ARE YOU FROM
PARIS OR BARCELONA *

1179
00:51:14,495 --> 00:51:17,017
* NO I'M FROM ARIZONA *

1180
00:51:17,017 --> 00:51:20,258
* SEXUAL WOMAN I RESPECT YOU SO MUCH

1181
00:51:20,258 --> 00:51:26,177
I'VE JUST
DEMONSTRATED BY MY INSANE
BONER *

1182
00:51:26,177 --> 00:51:31,309
A BONER?
LET ME GUESS.
YOU WANT TO KISS ME NOW.

1183
00:51:31,309 --> 00:51:33,706
>> YES, I DO.
BUT NOT YET.

1184
00:51:33,706 --> 00:51:37,827
YOU NEED TIME TO DIGEST ALL THAT
SPAGHETTI.

1185
00:51:37,827 --> 00:51:42,050
SO NOW COULD WE JUST HUG?
>> YES, GOOD IDEA.

1186
00:51:42,050 --> 00:51:45,460
I WOULD HAVE FORGOTTEN TO DIGEST
AND REGRETTED IT LATER.

1187
00:51:45,460 --> 00:51:48,234
>> OH, WHAT THEY SAY ABOUT YOU
IS TRUE.

1188
00:51:48,234 --> 00:51:51,040
YOU ARE EVERYONE'S CUP OF TEA.

1189
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:55,120
INCLUDING ME, OSCAR ISAAC.
>> OH, I KNOW, OSCAR ISAAC.

1190
00:51:55,120 --> 00:51:59,308
>> SORRY.
IS THAT -- IT SAYS MY REAL NAME
ON THE CARD.
IS THAT A MISTAKE?

1191
00:51:59,308 --> 00:52:03,946
>> I DON'T KNOW.
I GUESS -- THE WRITERS ARE SO
ANNOYING AND STUPID.

1192
00:52:03,946 --> 00:52:08,906
I WOULD SAY I GUESS GO WITH IT?
>> OKAY.
ALL RIGHT.

1193
00:52:08,906 --> 00:52:14,112
THEN LET'S GET MY FAT ASS ON
YOUR LAP.
>> YES.

1194
00:52:16,990 --> 00:52:18,590
SEXUAL

1195
00:52:18,590 --> 00:52:21,940
ASS

1196
00:52:29,315 --> 00:52:31,584
* YOU THOUGHT YOU

1197
00:52:29,315 --> 00:52:31,584
COULD FIX IT

1198
00:52:29,315 --> 00:52:31,584
BY YOURSELF *

1199
00:52:31,584 --> 00:52:34,554
* PLUMBING'S JUST AS EASY

1200
00:52:31,584 --> 00:52:34,554
AS BUILDING A SHELF *

1201
00:52:31,584 --> 00:52:34,554
* YOUR DIY BECOMES OMG

1202
00:52:34,554 --> 00:52:42,562
YOU'RE IN OVER YOUR HEAD *

1203
00:52:34,554 --> 00:52:42,562
>>> WELL, HELLO.

1204
00:52:34,554 --> 00:52:42,562
I'M GUS VANZANT.

1205
00:52:42,562 --> 00:52:49,235
AND WELCOME TO "IN OVER YOUR

1206
00:52:42,562 --> 00:52:49,235
HEAD" WHERE WE TALK TO FOLKS WHO

1207
00:52:42,562 --> 00:52:49,235
GOT A LITTLE OVERCONFIDENT

1208
00:52:49,235 --> 00:52:52,672
TAKING ON PROJECTS AROUND THE

1209
00:52:49,235 --> 00:52:52,672
HOUSE.

1210
00:52:49,235 --> 00:52:52,672
SPONSORED BY THUMB ICE.

1211
00:52:52,672 --> 00:52:59,846
DID YOU WHACK YOUR THUMB WITH A

1212
00:52:52,672 --> 00:52:59,846
HAMMER LIKE A CARTOON IDIOT?

1213
00:52:52,672 --> 00:52:59,846
NUMB THE PAIN WITH THUMB ICE.

1214
00:52:59,846 --> 00:53:01,781
OUR FIRST GUEST IS TOMMY DORIAN,

1215
00:52:59,846 --> 00:53:01,781
WHO SAID HE TRIED TO INSTALL HIS

1216
00:52:59,846 --> 00:53:01,781
OWN POOL.

1217
00:53:01,781 --> 00:53:07,787
UH-OH.

1218
00:53:01,781 --> 00:53:07,787
COME ON IN, TOMMY.

1219
00:53:01,781 --> 00:53:07,787
**

1220
00:53:07,787 --> 00:53:10,757
ALL RIGHT.

1221
00:53:07,787 --> 00:53:10,757
WELL, LOOKS LIKE YOUR HAIR'S

1222
00:53:07,787 --> 00:53:10,757
STILL A LITTLE WET FROM THE POOL

1223
00:53:10,757 --> 00:53:16,162
THERE, TOMMY.

1224
00:53:10,757 --> 00:53:16,162
>> NO, THAT'S UNRELATED.

1225
00:53:16,162 --> 00:53:24,304
>> OKAY.

1226
00:53:16,162 --> 00:53:24,304
SO TELL US, WHAT WAS BEHIND YOUR

1227
00:53:16,162 --> 00:53:24,304
THINKING BEHIND BUILDING YOUR

1228
00:53:24,304 --> 00:53:26,339
OWN POOL?

1229
00:53:24,304 --> 00:53:26,339
>> WELL, MY NEIGHBOR PUT ONE IN.

1230
00:53:24,304 --> 00:53:26,339
HIRED A WHOLE CREW AND AN

1231
00:53:26,339 --> 00:53:28,108
ARCHITECT.

1232
00:53:26,339 --> 00:53:28,108
THE WHOLE NINE YARDS.

1233
00:53:26,339 --> 00:53:28,108
I THOUGHT, IT'S BASICALLY A HOLE

1234
00:53:28,108 --> 00:53:31,845
PLUS A HOSE.

1235
00:53:28,108 --> 00:53:31,845
WHY OVERTHINK IT?

1236
00:53:28,108 --> 00:53:31,845
>> UH-HUH.

1237
00:53:31,845 --> 00:53:36,149
AND WHEN DID THINGS GO WRONG?

1238
00:53:31,845 --> 00:53:36,149
>> ALMOST IMMEDIATELY, GUS.

1239
00:53:31,845 --> 00:53:36,149
MY PROBLEM STARTED WHEN I TRIED

1240
00:53:36,149 --> 00:53:39,686
TO POUR THE CONCRETE WHILE I WAS

1241
00:53:36,149 --> 00:53:39,686
STILL DIGGING, TO SAVE TIME.

1242
00:53:36,149 --> 00:53:39,686
>> OH, WOW.

1243
00:53:39,686 --> 00:53:43,656
>> OH WOW IS RIGHT.

1244
00:53:39,686 --> 00:53:43,656
CUT TO, I'M UP TO MY WAIST IN

1245
00:53:39,686 --> 00:53:43,656
HARD CONCRETE SCREAMING, "HELP!

1246
00:53:43,656 --> 00:53:46,659
SOMEONE TURN OFF THE HOSE!"

1247
00:53:43,656 --> 00:53:46,659
>> SO YOU WERE ALREADY RUNNING

1248
00:53:43,656 --> 00:53:46,659
THE HOSE?

1249
00:53:46,659 --> 00:53:51,231
>> TO FILL THE POOL, TO SAVE

1250
00:53:46,659 --> 00:53:51,231
TIME, YES.

1251
00:53:46,659 --> 00:53:51,231
HAD TO HAVE IT OPEN FOR NEW

1252
00:53:51,231 --> 00:53:54,200
YEAR'S.

1253
00:53:51,231 --> 00:53:54,200
>> WELL, LOOKING BACK, ANY

1254
00:53:51,231 --> 00:53:54,200
REGRETS?

1255
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:58,271
>> I DO WISH I HADN'T PUNCTURED

1256
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:58,271
MY SEPTIC TANK.

1257
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:58,271
THAT'S A WHOLE DIFFERENT KIND OF

1258
00:53:58,271 --> 00:54:14,621
POOL.

1259
00:53:58,271 --> 00:54:14,621
>> THANKS FOR COMING, TOMMY.

1260
00:53:58,271 --> 00:54:14,621
>> THANKS FOR ALLOWING ME.

1261
00:54:14,621 --> 00:54:17,157
>> ALL RIGHT.

1262
00:54:17,157 --> 00:54:20,060
OUR NEXT GUEST THOUGHT THAT HE

1263
00:54:17,157 --> 00:54:20,060
SHOULD, QUOTE, DO HIS OWN

1264
00:54:17,157 --> 00:54:20,060
ELECTRICAL.

1265
00:54:20,060 --> 00:54:27,334
PLEASE WELCOME FELIX CREWE!

1266
00:54:20,060 --> 00:54:27,334
**

1267
00:54:20,060 --> 00:54:27,334
>> HEY GUS.

1268
00:54:27,334 --> 00:54:35,709
LONG TIME, FIRST TIME.

1269
00:54:27,334 --> 00:54:35,709
>> YOU MEAN, LONG TIME WATCH,

1270
00:54:27,334 --> 00:54:35,709
FIRST-TIME GUEST?

1271
00:54:35,709 --> 00:54:38,845
>> NO.

1272
00:54:35,709 --> 00:54:38,845
FIRST TIME ELECTROCUTED.

1273
00:54:35,709 --> 00:54:38,845
LONG TIME IT HURT.

1274
00:54:38,845 --> 00:54:41,481
>> SO, HOW DID YOU DECIDE TO DO

1275
00:54:38,845 --> 00:54:41,481
YOUR OWN ELECTRICAL WORK?

1276
00:54:41,481 --> 00:54:43,249
>> WELL, I KEEP TELLING MY WIFE,

1277
00:54:41,481 --> 00:54:43,249
IT'S JUST WIRES.

1278
00:54:41,481 --> 00:54:43,249
BABE, IT'S JUST WIRES.

1279
00:54:43,249 --> 00:54:48,988
HONEY, NOTHING'S GOING TO

1280
00:54:43,249 --> 00:54:48,988
HAPPEN, IT'S WIRES.

1281
00:54:43,249 --> 00:54:48,988
>> RIGHT.

1282
00:54:48,988 --> 00:54:53,393
>> YOU KNOW WHEN YOU SEE A GUY

1283
00:54:48,988 --> 00:54:53,393
DEFUSING BOMBS IN THE MOVIES YOU

1284
00:54:48,988 --> 00:54:53,393
THINK, I COULD DO THAT?

1285
00:54:53,393 --> 00:54:56,830
>> I'VE NEVER THOUGHT THAT.

1286
00:54:53,393 --> 00:54:56,830
>> WELL, I HAVE A LOT.

1287
00:54:53,393 --> 00:54:56,830
SO I THOUGHT, "WHAT THE HELL,

1288
00:54:56,830 --> 00:55:00,600
I'M GOING TO INSTALL MY OWN

1289
00:54:56,830 --> 00:55:00,600
CIRCUIT BREAKER."

1290
00:54:56,830 --> 00:55:00,600
>> OH, MY GOD.

1291
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:07,941
>> NO, TRUST ME, THERE IS NO

1292
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:07,941
GOD.

1293
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:07,941
NOW, THE WHOLE IDEA OF A BREAKER

1294
00:55:07,941 --> 00:55:13,680
IS TO STOP A POWER SURGE, RIGHT?

1295
00:55:07,941 --> 00:55:13,680
SO, I THINK I SHOULD START WITH

1296
00:55:07,941 --> 00:55:13,680
THE POWER DIALED ALL THE WAY UP

1297
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:16,850
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT I'M TRYING

1298
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:16,850
TO PROTECT MYSELF AGAINST,

1299
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:16,850
RIGHT?

1300
00:55:16,850 --> 00:55:20,320
>> THAT IS VERY BAD LOGIC.

1301
00:55:16,850 --> 00:55:20,320
>> SO I GOT THIS THING CRANKED

1302
00:55:16,850 --> 00:55:20,320
UP HIGHER THAN LIGHTNING AND I'M

1303
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:27,527
LIKE, "TIME TO SCREW IN THE

1304
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:27,527
METAL SCREWS," RIGHT?

1305
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:27,527
>> NO, NOT RIGHT.

1306
00:55:27,527 --> 00:55:33,667
>> CUT TO -- I FLY SO HARD

1307
00:55:27,527 --> 00:55:33,667
THROUGH A SHEET OF DRYWALL THAT

1308
00:55:27,527 --> 00:55:33,667
MY SCREAM PHYSICALLY DETACHES

1309
00:55:33,667 --> 00:55:35,735
FROM MY BODY AND TRAVELS AT A

1310
00:55:33,667 --> 00:55:35,735
SLOWER SPEED.

1311
00:55:33,667 --> 00:55:35,735
KIND OF LIKE PETER PAN'S SHADOW

1312
00:55:35,735 --> 00:55:40,840
DETACHING FROM HIS BODY.

1313
00:55:35,735 --> 00:55:40,840
>> YEAH, GOT IT.

1314
00:55:35,735 --> 00:55:40,840
>> SO AFTER I HIT A STEEL

1315
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:46,212
SUPPORT COLUMN, WIPING OUT THE

1316
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:46,212
ENTIRE FIRST FLOOR OF MY HOME, I

1317
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:46,212
AM HIT IN THE FACE BY MY OWN

1318
00:55:46,212 --> 00:55:51,918
SCREAM.

1319
00:55:46,212 --> 00:55:51,918
WILD, RIGHT?

1320
00:55:46,212 --> 00:55:51,918
>> WOW.

1321
00:55:51,918 --> 00:55:53,987
AND WHAT DID YOU LEARN FROM ALL

1322
00:55:51,918 --> 00:55:53,987
OF THIS?

1323
00:55:51,918 --> 00:55:53,987
>> GLOVES.

1324
00:55:53,987 --> 00:56:04,431
YOU'VE GOT TO WEAR GLOVES.

1325
00:55:53,987 --> 00:56:04,431
>> WELL, THANK YOU, FELIX.

1326
00:55:53,987 --> 00:56:04,431
>> EXCITED TO GET MY CHECK.

1327
00:56:04,431 --> 00:56:06,866
>> THERE'S NO CHECK.

1328
00:56:04,431 --> 00:56:06,866
>> ALL RIGHT.

1329
00:56:06,866 --> 00:56:11,237
AND OUR FINAL GUEST SAYS THAT

1330
00:56:06,866 --> 00:56:11,237
SHE'S BEEN TRYING TO REPAIR HER

1331
00:56:06,866 --> 00:56:11,237
HOME FOR MONTHS.

1332
00:56:11,237 --> 00:56:15,308
PLEASE WELCOME -- THIS CAN'T BE

1333
00:56:11,237 --> 00:56:15,308
RIGHT.

1334
00:56:11,237 --> 00:56:15,308
MY WIFE CARLISA.

1335
00:56:15,308 --> 00:56:19,679
**

1336
00:56:15,308 --> 00:56:19,679
HEY, BABY.

1337
00:56:15,308 --> 00:56:19,679
UH, WHAT YOU DOING HERE?

1338
00:56:19,679 --> 00:56:24,417
>> JUST TRYING TO REPAIR MY

1339
00:56:19,679 --> 00:56:24,417
HOME.

1340
00:56:19,679 --> 00:56:24,417
THIS DAMN FOOL IS OUT HERE

1341
00:56:24,417 --> 00:56:28,822
PRETENDING HE'S A BIG EXPERT.

1342
00:56:24,417 --> 00:56:28,822
MEANWHILE, HIS OWN HOUSE IS

1343
00:56:24,417 --> 00:56:28,822
LITERALLY FALLING APART.

1344
00:56:28,822 --> 00:56:32,692
>> WELL, IF YOU HAVE A PROBLEM,

1345
00:56:28,822 --> 00:56:32,692
BABY, I'M HAPPY TO FIX IT.

1346
00:56:28,822 --> 00:56:32,692
>> WITH WHAT?

1347
00:56:32,692 --> 00:56:36,696
THIS IS YOUR TOOLBOX.

1348
00:56:32,692 --> 00:56:36,696
BUT THERE AREN'T NO TOOLS IN

1349
00:56:32,692 --> 00:56:36,696
HERE, THOUGH.

1350
00:56:36,696 --> 00:56:39,833
IT'S JUST CANS OF BLACK'S BEER.

1351
00:56:36,696 --> 00:56:39,833
>> HEY, I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR

1352
00:56:36,696 --> 00:56:39,833
THOSE.

1353
00:56:39,833 --> 00:56:45,672
>> THERE'S NO TOOLS IN THIS

1354
00:56:39,833 --> 00:56:45,672
WHOLE GOOFY-ASS WORKSHOP.

1355
00:56:39,833 --> 00:56:45,672
IT'S JUST CHOCOLATE BARS THAT

1356
00:56:45,672 --> 00:56:50,343
LOOK LIKE TOOLS.

1357
00:56:45,672 --> 00:56:50,343
>> WELL, SOMETIMES I GET A

1358
00:56:45,672 --> 00:56:50,343
LITTLE HUNGRY.

1359
00:56:50,343 --> 00:56:53,079
>> MEANWHILE, OUR TOILET HASN'T

1360
00:56:50,343 --> 00:56:53,079
WORKED IN MONTHS.

1361
00:56:50,343 --> 00:56:53,079
I OPENED THE LID OF THE TANK AND

1362
00:56:53,079 --> 00:57:02,188
SAW THIS.

1363
00:56:53,079 --> 00:57:02,188
>> WELL, YOU NEVER KNOW WHEN YOU

1364
00:56:53,079 --> 00:57:02,188
MIGHT NEED AN ICE COLD HOT DOG.

1365
00:57:02,188 --> 00:57:07,327
>> AND THEN YOU SNUCK SOME

1366
00:57:02,188 --> 00:57:07,327
CRUSHED UP PEANUT SHELLS INTO

1367
00:57:02,188 --> 00:57:07,327
OUR SON'S LUNCH TO PROVE THAT HE

1368
00:57:07,327 --> 00:57:21,574
WAS FAKING HIS PEANUT ALLERGY.

1369
00:57:07,327 --> 00:57:21,574
>> WELL, THE IMPORTANT THING IS

1370
00:57:07,327 --> 00:57:21,574
THAT I TRUST YOU NOW.

1371
00:57:21,574 --> 00:57:24,044
I STILL THINK HE MAY BE

1372
00:57:21,574 --> 00:57:24,044
EXAGGERATING A LITTLE BIT.

1373
00:57:21,574 --> 00:57:24,044
>> GUS.

1374
00:57:24,044 --> 00:57:25,879
WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO SAY FOR

1375
00:57:24,044 --> 00:57:25,879
YOURSELF?

1376
00:57:24,044 --> 00:57:25,879
>> LOOK.

1377
00:57:25,879 --> 00:57:27,914
I THINK IT'S PRETTY CLEAR THAT I

1378
00:57:25,879 --> 00:57:27,914
AM --

1379
00:57:25,879 --> 00:57:27,914
* IN OVER MY HEAD *

1380
00:57:27,914 --> 00:57:32,452
>> NO, NO, NO.

1381
00:57:27,914 --> 00:57:32,452
DON'T YOU DARE SING THAT DAMN

1382
00:57:27,914 --> 00:57:32,452
JINGLE TO ME, NO.

1383
00:57:32,452 --> 00:57:38,692
THIS MAN SUCKED UP A WASP NEST

1384
00:57:32,452 --> 00:57:38,692
WITH A VACUUM AND NOW HE WON'T

1385
00:57:32,452 --> 00:57:38,692
EVEN THROW IT AWAY.

1386
00:57:38,692 --> 00:57:42,829
>> LISTEN, DYSON --

1387
00:57:38,692 --> 00:57:42,829
>> IDIOT.

1388
00:57:38,692 --> 00:57:42,829
YOU'S AN IDIOT.

1389
00:57:42,829 --> 00:57:45,565
>> IDIOT.

1390
00:57:42,829 --> 00:57:45,565
YOU'S AN IDIOT.

1391
00:57:42,829 --> 00:57:45,565
>> YOU WANT SOME OF THIS --

1392
00:57:53,264 --> 00:57:56,802

01:00:53,253 --> 01:00:58,324
THAT WAS GREAT, LINUS.

1448
01:00:58,324 --> 01:01:03,797
AND VERY RELEVANT, TOO.

1449
01:00:58,324 --> 01:01:03,797
>> VERY MUCH THE INTENTION.

1450
01:00:58,324 --> 01:01:03,797
THANK YOU.

1451
01:01:03,797 --> 01:01:07,634

1453
01:01:03,797 --> 01:01:07,634
AND WE WILL BE BACK NEXT MONTH,

1454
01:01:07,634 --> 01:01:13,406
ALL ARE WELCOME.

1455
01:01:07,634 --> 01:01:13,406
SIR, I'M SORRY.

1456
01:01:07,634 --> 01:01:13,406
WE'LL BE TWO MINUTES.

1457
01:01:13,406 --> 01:01:16,543
>> OH, MY GOSH.

1458
01:01:13,406 --> 01:01:16,543
YOU'RE NOT FINISHED.

1459
01:01:13,406 --> 01:01:16,543
EXCUSE ME.

1460
01:01:16,543 --> 01:01:19,846
>> WELL, ACTUALLY, SIR -- I

1461
01:01:16,543 --> 01:01:19,846
DON'T THINK WE'VE EVER ACTUALLY

1462
01:01:16,543 --> 01:01:19,846
SPOKEN.

1463
01:01:19,846 --> 01:01:23,650
BUT I FEEL LIKE I ALWAYS SEE YOU

1464
01:01:19,846 --> 01:01:23,650
WITH A DIFFERENT BOOK.

1465
01:01:19,846 --> 01:01:23,650
YOU LIKE READING?

1466
01:01:23,650 --> 01:01:27,220
>> OH, YEAH.

1467
01:01:23,650 --> 01:01:27,220
YES, MA'AM.

1468
01:01:23,650 --> 01:01:27,220
IT'S HOW I'VE SEEN THE WORLD TEN

1469
01:01:27,220 --> 01:01:32,525
TIMES OVER, BECAUSE OF MY BOOKS.

1470
01:01:27,220 --> 01:01:32,525
>> I LOVE THAT.

1471
01:01:27,220 --> 01:01:32,525
YOU EVER TRY ANY WRITING?

1472
01:01:32,525 --> 01:01:36,963
>> I MEAN, I DABBLE.

1473
01:01:32,525 --> 01:01:36,963
BUT NO, MAYBE ONE DAY.

1474
01:01:32,525 --> 01:01:36,963
YOU ALL ARE THE WRITERS.

1475
01:01:36,963 --> 01:01:42,602
>> WELL, WHY DON'T YOU READ US

1476
01:01:36,963 --> 01:01:42,602
SOMETHING?

1477
01:01:36,963 --> 01:01:42,602
WHATEVER YOU GOT.

1478
01:01:42,602 --> 01:01:46,706
>> OH, I DON'T KNOW.

1479
01:01:42,602 --> 01:01:46,706
>> HEY, HEY.

1480
01:01:42,602 --> 01:01:46,706
NO JUDGMENTS HERE.

1481
01:01:46,706 --> 01:01:51,211
WE'RE ALL JUST TRYING STUFF OUT.

1482
01:01:46,706 --> 01:01:51,211
PROMISE.

1483
01:01:46,706 --> 01:01:51,211
>> COME ON, MAN, TAKE A SEAT.

1484
01:01:51,211 --> 01:01:54,814
>> YEAH, I'D LOVE TO HEAR IT,

1485
01:01:51,211 --> 01:01:54,814
PAL.

1486
01:01:51,211 --> 01:01:54,814
>> ABSOLUTELY.

1487
01:01:54,814 --> 01:02:00,320
>> GOSH, THAT'S SO NICE.

1488
01:01:54,814 --> 01:02:00,320
I'VE NEVER READ IN FRONT OF

1489
01:01:54,814 --> 01:02:00,320
PEOPLE BEFORE.

1490
01:02:00,320 --> 01:02:03,723
THIS ONE'S CALLED "THE APOGEE OF

1491
01:02:00,320 --> 01:02:03,723
MIDNIGHT."

1492
01:02:00,320 --> 01:02:03,723
>> OH, LOVELY.

1493
01:02:03,723 --> 01:02:08,728
PLEASE.

1494
01:02:03,723 --> 01:02:08,728
>> OKAY.

1495
01:02:03,723 --> 01:02:08,728
THERE IT WAS AGAIN.

1496
01:02:08,728 --> 01:02:12,365
THE SOUND OF MOP ON TILE.

1497
01:02:08,728 --> 01:02:12,365
THE START OF ANOTHER LATE NIGHT.

1498
01:02:08,728 --> 01:02:12,365
ONE OF THOUSANDS LIKE IT.

1499
01:02:12,365 --> 01:02:16,536
ALONE IN CHANDLER HIGH.

1500
01:02:12,365 --> 01:02:16,536
BUT THE JANITOR LIKED THE

1501
01:02:12,365 --> 01:02:16,536
SILENCE.

1502
01:02:16,536 --> 01:02:21,107
IT HELD HIM IN A COOL, DELICATE

1503
01:02:16,536 --> 01:02:21,107
CALM.

1504
01:02:16,536 --> 01:02:21,107
>> HM, WOW, I REALLY LIKE THAT.

1505
01:02:21,107 --> 01:02:27,547
>> THANK YOU.

1506
01:02:21,107 --> 01:02:27,547
THEN, FOOTSTEPS.

1507
01:02:21,107 --> 01:02:27,547
LOUD AND GETTING CLOSER.

1508
01:02:27,547 --> 01:02:33,286
HELLO?

1509
01:02:27,547 --> 01:02:33,286
SCHOOL'S CLOSED.

1510
01:02:27,547 --> 01:02:33,286
A WOMAN TURNED THE CORNER.

1511
01:02:33,286 --> 01:02:37,290
SHE LOOKED LOST.

1512
01:02:33,286 --> 01:02:37,290
SORRY, I'M LOOKING FOR SOMEONE

1513
01:02:33,286 --> 01:02:37,290

OH, YEAH?

01:02:37,290 --> 01:02:43,763
WHO'S ASKING?

1516
01:02:37,290 --> 01:02:43,763
MY NAME IS DUA LIPA.

1517
01:02:43,763 --> 01:02:47,901
I'M A BIG POP STAR AND I'M

01:02:43,763 --> 01:02:47,901
MIKE.

1520
01:02:47,901 --> 01:02:55,308
>> OKAY.

1521
01:02:47,901 --> 01:02:55,308
>> THE JANITOR PAUSED.

1522
01:02:47,901 --> 01:02:55,308
THAT WAS HIS NAME.

1523
01:02:55,308 --> 01:03:00,513
DUA LIPA SIGHED.

1524
01:02:55,308 --> 01:03:00,513
YOU HAVEN'T HEARD OF ME, HAVE

1525
01:02:55,308 --> 01:03:00,513
YOU?

1526
01:03:00,513 --> 01:03:04,651
SORRY, MA'AM.

1527
01:03:00,513 --> 01:03:04,651
MORE OF A CLASSIC ROCK GUY

1528
01:03:00,513 --> 01:03:04,651
MYSELF.

1529
01:03:04,651 --> 01:03:08,555
BUT SURE, MAYBE I'VE SEEN A

1530
01:03:04,651 --> 01:03:08,555
BIKINI PIC OR TWO, HOW CAN I

1531
01:03:04,651 --> 01:03:08,555
HELP?

1532
01:03:08,555 --> 01:03:14,594
>> OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT, IT IS

1533
01:03:08,555 --> 01:03:14,594
GETTING PRETTY LATE.

1534
01:03:08,555 --> 01:03:14,594
SO I THINK WE SHOULD PROBABLY

1535
01:03:14,594 --> 01:03:16,196
WRAP IT UP.

1536
01:03:14,594 --> 01:03:16,196
>> WHAT?

1537
01:03:14,594 --> 01:03:16,196
HE JUST STARTED.

1538
01:03:16,196 --> 01:03:19,632
>> WRAP UP?

1539
01:03:16,196 --> 01:03:19,632
SO I CAN MOP?

1540
01:03:16,196 --> 01:03:19,632
HECK, I GOT TIME.

1541
01:03:19,632 --> 01:03:23,503
>> YEAH, AND I WANT TO KNOW

1542
01:03:19,632 --> 01:03:23,503
WHERE IT'S GOING.

1543
01:03:19,632 --> 01:03:23,503
>> I DON'T.

1544
01:03:23,503 --> 01:03:28,108
>> YEAH, I THINK I'M GOOD.

1545
01:03:23,503 --> 01:03:28,108
>> YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.

1546
01:03:23,503 --> 01:03:28,108
I'M BAD AT THIS.

1547
01:03:28,108 --> 01:03:32,612
>> NO, NO.

1548
01:03:28,108 --> 01:03:32,612
WE SUPPORT IT.

1549
01:03:28,108 --> 01:03:32,612
SO PLEASE, GO AHEAD.

1550
01:03:32,612 --> 01:03:37,550
>> OH, THANK YOU.

1551
01:03:32,612 --> 01:03:37,550
MIND IF I SIT DOWN?

1552
01:03:32,612 --> 01:03:37,550
DUA LIPA WAS EXHAUSTED.

1553
01:03:37,550 --> 01:03:42,088
SHE'D JUST DONE A CONCERT IN

1554
01:03:37,550 --> 01:03:42,088

1555

SHE WAS COOL.

1559
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:51,297
SO WHAT BRINGS YOU OUT ALL THIS

1560
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:51,297

1561
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:51,297
GIRLIE?

1562
01:03:51,297 --> 01:03:59,105
OH, I DON'T KNOW, THIS IS GOING

1563
01:03:51,297 --> 01:03:59,105
TO SOUND CRAZY.

1564
01:03:51,297 --> 01:03:59,105
COME ON, DUA LIPA, YOU KNOW YOU

1565
01:03:59,105 --> 01:04:03,610
CAN TALK TO ME.

1566
01:03:59,105 --> 01:04:03,610
I'M YOUR FRIEND.

1567
01:03:59,105 --> 01:04:03,610
IT'S TRUE.

1568
01:04:03,610 --> 01:04:08,815
THEY WERE FAST FRIENDS.

1569
01:04:03,610 --> 01:04:08,815
AND NOTHING MORE.

1570
01:04:03,610 --> 01:04:08,815
RIGHT?

1571
01:04:08,815 --> 01:04:18,224
>> ARE YOU ASKING US?

1572
01:04:08,815 --> 01:04:18,224
>> PLEASE.

1573
01:04:08,815 --> 01:04:18,224
I'M STILL READING.

1574
01:04:18,224 --> 01:04:21,695
WELL, I GUESS I WANTED TO ASK

1575
01:04:18,224 --> 01:04:21,695

01:04:21,695 --> 01:04:24,664
WHAT'S UP?

1578
01:04:21,695 --> 01:04:24,664
WOULD YOU TEACH ME HOW TO MAKE

1579
01:04:21,695 --> 01:04:24,664
OUT?

1580
01:04:24,664 --> 01:04:28,268
I'VE NEVER DONE IT BEFORE.

1581
01:04:24,664 --> 01:04:28,268
>> OKAY, I'M SORRY, I JUST --

1582
01:04:24,664 --> 01:04:28,268
NO.

1583
01:04:28,268 --> 01:04:35,075
>> OH, COME ON.

1584
01:04:28,268 --> 01:04:35,075
>> WHY?

1585
01:04:28,268 --> 01:04:35,075
>> LOOK, I THINK THAT IT'S GREAT

1586
01:04:35,075 --> 01:04:39,779
THAT YOU WRITE.

1587
01:04:35,075 --> 01:04:39,779
I JUST DON'T REALLY WANT TO

1588
01:04:35,075 --> 01:04:39,779
HEAR ABOUT YOUR WEIRD, MADE-UP

1589
01:04:39,779 --> 01:04:41,247

1590
01:04:39,779 --> 01:04:41,247
I'M SORRY, I DON'T.

1591
01:04:39,779 --> 01:04:41,247
>> MY THING?

1592
01:04:41,247 --> 01:04:44,317
THIS AIN'T ME, MAMA, THIS IS

1593
01:04:41,247 --> 01:04:44,317
FICTION.

1594
01:04:41,247 --> 01:04:44,317
THIRD PERSON.

1595
01:04:44,317 --> 01:04:50,890

1596
01:04:44,317 --> 01:04:50,890
MIKE.

1597

1598
01:04:50,890 --> 01:04:56,529
>> AND SO WHAT IS YOUR NAME?

1599
01:04:50,890 --> 01:04:56,529

1600
01:04:50,890 --> 01:04:56,529
WHY?

1601
01:04:56,529 --> 01:05:03,169
>> IT'S KIND OF CREEPY, MAN.

1602
01:04:56,529 --> 01:05:03,169
>> VERY CREEPY.

1603
01:04:56,529 --> 01:05:03,169
>> I SEE.

1604
01:05:03,169 --> 01:05:05,939
I GUESS I'M NOT A WRITER AFTER

1605
01:05:03,169 --> 01:05:05,939
ALL.

1606
01:05:03,169 --> 01:05:05,939
BACK TO THE TOILETS IT IS.

1607
01:05:05,939 --> 01:05:09,175
>> JUST FINISH IT, PLEASE.

1608
01:05:05,939 --> 01:05:09,175

OKAY.

1610
01:05:09,175 --> 01:05:14,447
SURE, DUA LIPA, I CAN TEACH YOU

1611
01:05:09,175 --> 01:05:14,447
HOW TO MAKE OUT.

1612
01:05:09,175 --> 01:05:14,447
WAIT, CAN MY FRIEND COME?

1613
01:05:14,447 --> 01:05:23,189
HER NAME IS TAWNY McDANIELS.

1614
01:05:14,447 --> 01:05:23,189
THE FAMOUS GINGER MILF?

1615
