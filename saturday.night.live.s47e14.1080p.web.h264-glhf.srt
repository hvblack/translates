1
00:00:02,202 --> 00:00:04,922
>>> AND NOW, LIVE FROM MAR-A-LAGO,

2
00:00:04,983 --> 00:00:09,127
IT'S THE "FOX NEWS
UKRAINIAN INVASION CELEBRATION
SPECTACULAR!"

3
00:00:09,127 --> 00:00:13,517
WITH YOUR HOSTS, TUCKER CARLSON
AND LAURA INGRAHAM!

4
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:28,327
>> GOOD EVENING.
I'M TUCKER CARLSON.

5
00:00:28,327 --> 00:00:30,556
I'M LIKE A PAIR OF BOAT SHOES
CAME TO LIFE.

6
00:00:30,556 --> 00:00:32,144
>> AND I'M LAURA INGRAHAM.

7
00:00:32,144 --> 00:00:36,000
AND WHEN I WATCH "HARRY POTTER"
I ROOT FOR VOLDEMORT.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,763
>> WE GOT INTO A LITTLE BIT OF
TROUBLE FOR ALL THE NICE THINGS
WE SAID ABOUT RUSSIA

9
00:00:40,763 --> 00:00:42,738
AND THE
MEAN THING WE SAID ABOUT
UKRAINE.

10
00:00:42,738 --> 00:00:47,002
>> WE DID SOUND PRETTY AWFUL IN
HINDSIGHT.
AND FORESIGHT.

11
00:00:47,002 --> 00:00:49,780
>> I KEPT ASKING WHY DO WE HATE
PUTIN?

12
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:52,341
AREN'T LIBERALS IN AMERICA EVEN
WORSE?

13
00:00:52,341 --> 00:00:55,224
>> AND I CALLED THE PRESIDENT OF
UKRAINE PATHETIC.

14
00:00:55,224 --> 00:00:57,559
HE STAYED AND FOUGHT WITH HIS PEOPLE IN THE WAR

15
00:00:57,559 --> 00:01:00,972
AND I CALLED
HIM PATHETIC FROM A NEWS DESK IN
WASHINGTON.

16
00:01:00,972 --> 00:01:04,425
>> I KEPT SAYING WE SHOULD BE
MORE WORRIED

17
00:01:04,501 --> 00:01:07,174
ABOUT OUR OWN
BORDER GETTING INVADED BY
MEXICO.

18
00:01:07,174 --> 00:01:11,263
BUT IN MY DEFENSE, I AM RACIST.
SO I THOUGHT THAT WAS TRUE.

19
00:01:11,263 --> 00:01:14,378
>> BUT TONIGHT WE'RE GOING TO
MAKE IT UP.

20
00:01:14,378 --> 00:01:17,630
WE'RE RAISING MONEY FOR THE REAL
VICTIMS OF THIS INVASION.

21
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:19,382
THE OLIGARCHS.

22
00:01:19,382 --> 00:01:24,351
BECAUSE WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT
THE BABIES.
THEIR SUGAR BABIES.

23
00:01:24,351 --> 00:01:29,363
WHO WILL POUR VODKA IN THEIR
MOUTHS?
SO MANY HORNY MOUTHS TO FEED.

24
00:01:29,363 --> 00:01:33,139
>> SO PLEASE OPEN YOUR WALLETS
AND BECAUSE THIS IS FOX NEWS

25
00:01:33,139 --> 00:01:36,629
YOU
CAN EITHER SEND MONEY OR TAKE
OUT A REVERSE MORTGAGE.

26
00:01:36,629 --> 00:01:41,089
SO FAR WE'VE RAISED OVER 8.3
BILLION RUBLES,

27
00:01:41,089 --> 00:01:43,808
WHICH COMES OUT
TO ALMOST $12.

28
00:01:43,808 --> 00:01:46,211
>> AND THIS IS INCREDIBLY
EXCITING.

29
00:01:46,211 --> 00:01:50,291
FORMER AND CURRENT PRESIDENT OF
THE UNITED STATES DONALD TRUMP

30
00:01:50,291 --> 00:01:52,791
IS MANNING THE PHONE LINES
HIMSELF.

31
00:01:52,791 --> 00:01:57,305
>> AND THE THING IS ABOUT
RIHANNA, SHE CAN PULL IT OFF.

32
00:01:57,305 --> 00:02:01,441
SHE CAN BE NINE MONTHS.
THE BODY'S STILL INCREDIBLE.

33
00:02:01,441 --> 00:02:03,645
BUT NOW YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A
LOT OF WOMEN

34
00:02:03,645 --> 00:02:07,234
SEEING THIS
RIGHT NOW, 3s, 4s, FRANKLY
TROLLS,

35
00:02:07,234 --> 00:02:09,540
WEARING THE SAME
SEE-THROUGH SHIRT.

36
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:12,105
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
I HESITATE TO SAY WHALES BECAUSE
I KNOW THE WHALES,

37
00:02:12,105 --> 00:02:14,431
I'M VERY
POPULAR WITH THE WHALES.
I DO GREAT WITH WHALES.

38
00:02:14,431 --> 00:02:18,111
THEY COME UP TO ME ON THE BEACH
AND THEY SAY THANK YOU, MR.
PRESIDENT.

39
00:02:18,111 --> 00:02:21,438
YOU KNOW, THE BLOWHOLES BLASTING
AWAY.
200, 300 FEET IN THE AIR.

40
00:02:21,438 --> 00:02:23,471
IT'S HOW THEY SALUTE ME.

41
00:02:23,471 --> 00:02:26,725
>> OKAY.
WE'LL COME BACK TO YOU, MR.
PRESIDENT,

42
00:02:26,725 --> 00:02:30,034
BECAUSE OUR FIRST
GUEST IS HERE.
HE'S A GREAT AMERICAN PATRIOT.

43
00:02:30,034 --> 00:02:33,877
SO GREAT THAT HE LEFT AMERICA
AND BECAME A RUSSIAN CITIZEN.

44
00:02:33,877 --> 00:02:38,020
THE PUFFIEST ACTION STAR IN THE
WORLD, STEVEN SEAGAL.

45
00:02:38,647 --> 00:02:43,198
>> THANK YOU.
THANK YOU, TUCKER.

46
00:02:43,198 --> 00:02:46,636
OH, WHAT A GLOBAL CRISIS WE ARE
FACING.

47
00:02:46,636 --> 00:02:52,221
AS SOMEONE WHO PROUDLY PRETENDS
TO BE BOTH NATIVE AMERICAN AND JAPANESE,

48
00:02:52,221 --> 00:02:54,834
I FEEL FOR ALL PEOPLE.

49
00:02:54,834 --> 00:02:57,440
>> NOW, YOU'RE CLOSE WITH
PRESIDENT PUTIN, RIGHT?

50
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:01,240
>> YES.
PUTIN AND I ARE, AS THEY SAY IN ANCIENT JAPAN,

51
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:03,587
ESKIMO BROTHERS.

52
00:03:03,587 --> 00:03:05,863
SO I WILL BE HONORING PUTIN

53
00:03:05,863 --> 00:03:10,638
BY PERFORMING AN AUTHENTIC
TAEKWONDO EXHIBITION.

54
00:03:14,311 --> 00:03:16,924
NOW IT'S TIME TO HONOR MYSELF

55
00:03:16,924 --> 00:03:20,970
WITH A TRADITIONAL JAPANESE
SHAMROCK SHAKE.

56
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:26,478
THE TRADITIONAL SEASONAL
BEVERAGE OF ALL AIKIDO
EXHIBITIONS.

57
00:03:27,564 --> 00:03:30,314
THANK

58
00:03:31,466 --> 00:03:37,623
>> LET'S CHECK BACK IN WITH THE
MAN WHO SAID PUTIN'S INVASION
WAS VERY SMART

59
00:03:37,623 --> 00:03:41,742
AND ALSO SAID
CHINA SHOULD INVADE TAIWAN NEXT.
MR. PRESIDENT?

60
00:03:41,742 --> 00:03:45,906
>> MY FAVORITE FOOD IS PROBABLY
BREAD.
YOU KNOW?

61
00:03:45,906 --> 00:03:49,305
AND MORE SPECIFICALLY BUN.
I LIKE BUN.

62
00:03:49,305 --> 00:03:52,141
BUN IS GREAT.
ESPECIALLY WITH RESPECT TO
BURGER.

63
00:03:52,141 --> 00:03:55,210
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
BEYOND BURGER.
CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT?

64
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:57,175
I WANT TO STAY RIGHT AT BURGER.

65
00:03:57,175 --> 00:03:59,261
BEYOND IS NOT GOOD.

66
00:03:59,261 --> 00:04:03,600
JOE BIDEN HAS GONE BEYOND BURGER
AND IT HAS NOT GONE SO WELL.

67
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:06,199
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
NEITHER HAS REBOOT OF FRESH
PRINCE.

68
00:04:06,199 --> 00:04:10,828
IT'S VERY DIFFERENT AND I'M
LAUGHING AND I'M LAUGHING BUT I
DON'T KNOW WHY.

69
00:04:10,828 --> 00:04:14,746
>> OKAY.

OTHER END OF THAT PHONE.

70
00:04:14,746 --> 00:04:18,195
SO LET'S HEAR WHAT KIND OF

THANK YOU SO MUCH.
I'M SO EXCITED TO BE HERE.

133
00:10:36,548 --> 00:10:39,237
THIS IS MY FIRST TIME HOSTING
SNL.

134
00:10:39,237 --> 00:10:40,985
THANK YOU.

135
00:10:40,985 --> 00:10:45,006
THEY ACTUALLY ASKED ME TO HOST
BACK IN 2015

136
00:10:45,098 --> 00:10:49,240
BUT I SAID "NO, I'M
NOT READY.
I WANT TO WAIT UNTIL AFTER THE
PANDEMIC."

137
00:10:49,302 --> 00:10:52,596
AND THEY WERE LIKE, "WHAT
PANDEMIC?"

138
00:10:52,596 --> 00:10:54,703
MY NAME IS OSCAR ISAAC,

139
00:10:54,703 --> 00:10:58,757
BUT MY FULL NAME IS
OSCAR ISAAC HERNANDEZ ESTRADA.

140
00:10:59,304 --> 00:11:03,500
I SAID TO HOLLYWOOD -- I SAID TO
THEM, "YOU CAN PICK TWO OF THESE
NAMES."

141
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:07,428
GUESS WHAT THEY WENT WITH.
THE WHITE ONES.

142
00:11:07,428 --> 00:11:10,650
I'M HALF GUATEMALAN, HALF CUBAN.

143
00:11:11,146 --> 00:11:16,211
OR AS CASTING DIRECTORS CALL
THAT, "ETHNICALLY AMBIGUOUS."

144
00:11:16,211 --> 00:11:18,316
ACCORDING TO THEM, I CAN PLAY ANYTHING

145
00:11:18,316 --> 00:11:21,898
FROM A PHARAOH TO
TIMOTHEE CHALAMET'S DADDY.

146
00:11:21,898 --> 00:11:26,534
YOU KNOW THAT JOKE, A PRIEST, A
RABBI, AND A MINISTER WALK INTO
A BAR?

147
00:11:26,534 --> 00:11:28,836
YEAH, I COULD PLAY ANYONE IN
THAT JOKE.

148
00:11:28,836 --> 00:11:33,923
BUT I AM EXCITED.
I'M JOINING THE MARVEL UNIVERSE
WITH "MOON KNIGHT."

149
00:11:35,965 --> 00:11:38,821
YOU KNOW, IT'S KIND OF A FULL
CIRCLE MOMENT

150
00:11:38,821 --> 00:11:42,265
SINCE THE FIRST
MOVIE I WAS EVER IN WAS CALLED
THE AVENGER.

151
00:11:42,265 --> 00:11:47,443
NOT "THE AVENGERS," WHICH WAS A
MASSIVE BLOCKBUSTER.
NO, THIS WAS "THE AVENGER,"

152
00:11:47,443 --> 00:11:51,685
WHICH IS A MOVIE THAT I WROTE,
DIRECTED, AND STARRED IN WHEN I
WAS 10 YEARS OLD.

153
00:11:51,781 --> 00:11:55,277
IT WAS SHOT ON LOCATION IN MY
BUDDY BRUCE FERGUSON'S BACK YARD

154
00:11:55,277 --> 00:11:57,213
IN OUR HOMETOWN OF MIAMI,
FLORIDA.

155
00:11:57,213 --> 00:12:00,983
I PLAY A NINJA ASSASSIN TRAINING
TO FIGHT HIS NEMESIS.

156
00:12:00,983 --> 00:12:04,716
AND WE ACTUALLY HAVE A CLIP.
THIS IS REAL, CHECK THIS OUT.

157
00:12:04,716 --> 00:12:07,601
>>  OKAY, THERE'S THE OPENING
TITLE.

158
00:12:07,601 --> 00:12:12,677
AND THERE I AM.
KIND OF LOSING MY BALANCE A
LITTLE BIT.

159
00:12:12,677 --> 00:12:14,399
PERFECT EDITING.

160
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:17,018
AND HERE COMES MY BIG STUNT.

161
00:12:17,018 --> 00:12:19,054
I TRAINED TWO MONTHS FOR THIS.

162
00:12:23,143 --> 00:12:26,382
I MEAN, ARGUABLY BETTER THAN THE
REAL "AVENGERS."

163
00:12:26,382 --> 00:12:29,766
AND I MADE IT FOR HALF THE
BUDGET, ONLY $110 MILLION.

164
00:12:29,766 --> 00:12:31,650
BUT I TOOK IT REALLY SERIOUSLY.

165
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:34,628
MAYBE A LITTLE TOO SERIOUSLY.
LIKE IN THIS SCENE.

166
00:12:34,628 --> 00:12:36,992
OKAY, THERE I AM ACTING MY HEART
OUT.

167
00:12:36,992 --> 00:12:40,003
AND THERE'S MY FRIEND'S DAD
CLEANING THE POOL.

168
00:12:40,003 --> 00:12:42,848
SHOUT-OUT TO MR. FERGUSON,

169
00:12:42,848 --> 00:12:45,301
AND SHOUT-OUT TO MY BUDDY, BRUCE.

170
00:12:45,301 --> 00:12:49,251
HE'S AT HOME WATCHING AND HE HAD
NO IDEA OUR OLD MOVIE WAS GOING
TO BE ON "SNL."

171
00:12:49,251 --> 00:12:52,812
I ACTUALLY HAD TO SIGN A
LICENSING AGREEMENT TO SHOW IT.

172
00:12:52,812 --> 00:12:57,210
THAT'S TRUE.
NBC UNIVERSAL NOW OWNS "THE
AVENGER."

173
00:12:57,210 --> 00:13:00,462
COMING THIS FALL TO PEACOCK!

174
00:13:00,462 --> 00:13:03,700
I'VE GOT ONE MORE CLIP.

175
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:07,347
THIS IS A SCENE I DID WITH
MYSELF WHERE I PLAY BOTH PARTS.

176
00:13:07,347 --> 00:13:10,176
OKAY?
HERE WE GO.

177
00:13:10,176 --> 00:13:12,320
THAT'S ME.
*I DIDN'T MEAN*

178
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:15,827
I'M MY OWN HENCHMAN.
* DO THIS*

179
00:13:18,349 --> 00:13:21,599
NOW WATCH WHAT I DO WITH THE
SWORD.

180
00:13:24,122 --> 00:13:26,868
TOTAL COMMITMENT FROM THE START.

181
00:13:26,868 --> 00:13:30,784
NOW, YOU MIGHT BE ASKING, OSCAR,
WHY DID YOU USE YOUR MONOLOGUE

182
00:13:30,784 --> 00:13:32,375
TO SHOW US THESE OLD HOME
VIDEOS?

183
00:13:32,375 --> 00:13:37,648
AND THE REASON IS IT'S IMPORTANT
TO ENCOURAGE KIDS TO BE WEIRDOS.

184
00:13:37,648 --> 00:13:42,153
BECAUSE EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE

185
00:13:42,153 --> 00:13:47,612
ONE OF THOSE WEIRDOS GROWS UP TO
HOST "SNL."

186
00:13:48,251 --> 00:13:52,962
WE'VE GOT A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU
TONIGHT.
CHARLI XCX IS HERE.

187
00:13:52,962 --> 00:13:55,681
SO STICK AROUND.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

188
00:14:05,045 --> 00:14:10,050
HEREBY PRESENT THE PAW PATROL

189
00:14:05,045 --> 00:14:10,050
WITH THIS MEDAL OF BRAVERY FOR

190
00:14:05,045 --> 00:14:10,050
STOPPING THAT OUT-OF-CONTROL HOT

191
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:15,855
AIR BALLOON.

192
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:15,855
WITH YOU PUPS ON PATROL, OUR

193
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:15,855
CITY IS IN GOOD HANDS.

194
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:23,363
>> DON'T YOU MEAN GOOD PAWS?

195
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:23,363
>> HA HA HA!

196
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:23,363
>> ENOUGH IS ENOUGH.

197
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:27,801
I'M CITY COUNCILMAN

198
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:27,801
HERB TANGIER.

199
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:27,801
MAYOR GOODWAY HAS PUT ALL OUR

200
00:14:27,801 --> 00:14:32,472
LIVES AT RISK WITH HER PAW

201
00:14:27,801 --> 00:14:32,472
PATROL INITIATIVE AND I SAY IT'S

202
00:14:27,801 --> 00:14:32,472
TIME TO VOTE HER OUT.

203
00:14:32,472 --> 00:14:37,744
FACT!

204
00:14:32,472 --> 00:14:37,744
THIS MAN FIRED ALL OF OUR CITY'S

205
00:14:32,472 --> 00:14:37,744
POLICE OFFICERS, FIREFIGHTERS,

206
00:14:37,744 --> 00:14:41,414
AND PARAMEDICS, AND REPLACED

207
00:14:37,744 --> 00:14:41,414
THEM WITH A GROUP OF SIX TALKING

208
00:14:37,744 --> 00:14:41,414
DOGS.

209
00:14:41,414 --> 00:14:43,883
I THINK THAT WAS A BAD IDEA.

210
00:14:41,414 --> 00:14:43,883
AND I'M NOT ALONE.

211
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:50,256
LISTEN TO THESE CONCERNED

212
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:50,256
CITIZENS.

213
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:50,256
>> I WAS EXCITED ABOUT THE PAW

214
00:14:50,256 --> 00:14:54,227
PATROL AT FIRST.

215
00:14:50,256 --> 00:14:54,227
TALKING DOGS WHO KNOW HOW TO FLY

216
00:14:50,256 --> 00:14:54,227
JETS AND DRIVE?

217
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:59,866
GREAT.

218
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:59,866
BUT IT'S BECOME CLEAR THAT SIX

219
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:59,866
DOGS CANNOT PROTECT A CITY

220
00:14:59,866 --> 00:15:05,905
ROUGHLY THE SIZE OF SAN DIEGO.

221
00:14:59,866 --> 00:15:05,905
>> CRIMINALS AND LOW-LIFES ARE

222
00:14:59,866 --> 00:15:05,905
FLOCKING HERE BECAUSE THEY KNOW

223
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:12,212
THERE'S ONLY ONE COP PATROLLING

224
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:12,212
OUR STREETS AND IT'S A DOG!

225
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:12,212
>> AND THERE'S ONLY ONE

226
00:15:12,212 --> 00:15:17,951
FIREFIGHTER, ALSO A DOG.

227
00:15:12,212 --> 00:15:17,951
SO IF THERE'S TWO FIRES AT THE

228
00:15:12,212 --> 00:15:17,951
SAME TIME?

229
00:15:17,951 --> 00:15:24,524
SOMEONE'S GETTING SCREWED, I

230
00:15:17,951 --> 00:15:24,524
GUESS?

231
00:15:17,951 --> 00:15:24,524
WHO IS IN CHARGE OF THIS

232
00:15:24,524 --> 00:15:28,762
ORGANIZATION?

233
00:15:24,524 --> 00:15:28,762
A CHILD?

234
00:15:24,524 --> 00:15:28,762
>> YES!

235
00:15:28,762 --> 00:15:31,698
THE PAW PATROL IS RUN BY A

236
00:15:28,762 --> 00:15:31,698
10-YEAR-OLD BOY NAMED RYDER.

237
00:15:28,762 --> 00:15:31,698
WHO IS THIS KID?

238
00:15:31,698 --> 00:15:36,302
BEATS ME!

239
00:15:31,698 --> 00:15:36,302
AS FAR AS WE CAN TELL, HE HAS NO

240
00:15:31,698 --> 00:15:36,302
PARENTS AND DOESN'T GO TO

241
00:15:36,302 --> 00:15:42,442
SCHOOL.

242
00:15:36,302 --> 00:15:42,442
BUT MAYBE THAT'S FOR THE BEST,

243
00:15:36,302 --> 00:15:42,442
BECAUSE WITH ALL OUR TAX DOLLARS

244
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:46,579
PAYING FOR A LITTLE COCKAPOO'S

245
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:46,579
JET PACK, WE NOW HAVE THE WORST

246
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:46,579
SCHOOLS IN THE STATE.

247
00:15:46,579 --> 00:15:52,352
THIS IS MY 17-YEAR-OLD SON.

248
00:15:46,579 --> 00:15:52,352
HE CAN BARELY READ.

249
00:15:46,579 --> 00:15:52,352
>> I CAN READ, I JUST DON'T KNOW

250
00:15:52,352 --> 00:15:56,389
WHAT SOUND VOWELS MAKE WHEN

251
00:15:52,352 --> 00:15:56,389
THEY'RE NEXT TO OTHER LETTERS IN

252
00:15:52,352 --> 00:15:56,389
A LINE.

253
00:15:56,389 --> 00:16:00,660
>> MAYOR GOODWAY, THIS IS ALL

254
00:15:56,389 --> 00:16:00,660
YOUR FAULT AND YOU NEED TO GO!

255
00:15:56,389 --> 00:16:00,660
>> FACT.

256
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:04,464
OUR CITY'S COVID RESPONSE WAS A

257
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:04,464
NATIONAL DISGRACE.

258
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:04,464
WHY?

259
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:09,269
BECAUSE SIX DOGS WERE IN CHARGE

260
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:09,269
OF IT.

261
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:09,269
>> FACT.

262
00:16:09,269 --> 00:16:16,810
CHASE THE POLICE DOG'S ONLY

263
00:16:09,269 --> 00:16:16,810
WEAPON IS A NET.

264
00:16:09,269 --> 00:16:16,810
QUESTION, HOW IS A NET GOING TO

265
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:24,150
HELP IF A LUNATIC ON BATH SALTS

266
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:24,150
IS EATING MY FACE?

267
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:24,150
ANSWER?

268
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:30,256
IT WON'T.

269
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:30,256
>> FACT, MARSHALL THE FIRE DOG

270
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:30,256
IS MY FAVORITE ONE.

271
00:16:30,256 --> 00:16:35,428
HE'S THE FUNNIEST PUP BY FAR AND

272
00:16:30,256 --> 00:16:35,428
THE COOLEST BY A MILE.

273
00:16:30,256 --> 00:16:35,428
BUT I DON'T THINK HE COULD CARRY

274
00:16:35,428 --> 00:16:42,702
ME DOWN A FLIGHT OF STAIRS

275
00:16:35,428 --> 00:16:42,702
BECAUSE HE AIN'T GOT NO HANDS.

276
00:16:35,428 --> 00:16:42,702
>> FACT, I ALSO LIKE MARSHALL

277
00:16:42,702 --> 00:16:45,905
THE BEST.

278
00:16:42,702 --> 00:16:45,905
HE'S SUPER BRAVE AND HIS JOKES

279
00:16:42,702 --> 00:16:45,905
NEVER MISS.

280
00:16:45,905 --> 00:16:52,345
BUT DO WE FEEL SAFE?

281
00:16:45,905 --> 00:16:52,345
NO!

282
00:16:45,905 --> 00:16:52,345
LISTEN TO THIS ACTUAL 911 CALL.

283
00:16:52,345 --> 00:16:55,515
>> PAW PATROL ARE READY TO ROLL,

284
00:16:52,345 --> 00:16:55,515
THIS IS RYDER, WHAT'S YOUR

285
00:16:52,345 --> 00:16:55,515
EMERGENCY?

286
00:16:55,515 --> 00:17:00,353
>> MY GIRLFRIEND, MAN.

287
00:16:55,515 --> 00:17:00,353
SHE'S NOT WAKING UP!

288
00:16:55,515 --> 00:17:00,353
HER EYES ARE, LIKE, ROLLED BACK.

289
00:17:00,353 --> 00:17:06,760
I THINK SHE'S OD'ing, MAN.

290
00:17:00,353 --> 00:17:06,760
>> UM -- PLEASE HOLD.

291
00:17:00,353 --> 00:17:06,760
* PAW PATROL *

292
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:10,230
>> UNACCEPTABLE!

293
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:10,230
AND THAT'S NOT THE ONLY

294
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:14,701
EMERGENCY THAT PAW PATROL'S

295
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:14,701
BUNGLED.

296
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:14,701
JUST ASK MY SISTER.

297
00:17:14,701 --> 00:17:19,039
>> I WENT INTO LABOR EARLY.

298
00:17:14,701 --> 00:17:19,039
I WAS ALONE AND CALLED 911 FOR

299
00:17:14,701 --> 00:17:19,039
HELP AND TOLD THEM MY WATER

300
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:25,478
BROKE.

301
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:25,478
SO THEY SENT ZUMA, THE WATER

302
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:25,478
RESCUE DOG.

303
00:17:25,478 --> 00:17:29,883
HE DIDN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS

304
00:17:25,478 --> 00:17:29,883
HAPPENING AND SAT THERE CHEWING

305
00:17:25,478 --> 00:17:29,883
ON HIS UPPER BUTT WHILE I GAVE

306
00:17:29,883 --> 00:17:37,424
BIRTH ON MY KITCHEN FLOOR.

307

472
00:24:08,081 --> 00:24:10,784
>> I WOULD SAY THAT'S

473
00:24:08,081 --> 00:24:10,784
INAPPROPRIATE.

474
00:24:10,784 --> 00:24:16,122
>> WRONG.

475
00:24:10,784 --> 00:24:16,122
>> HM.

476
00:24:10,784 --> 00:24:16,122
LET'S TRY ANOTHER ONE.

477
00:24:16,122 --> 00:24:19,359
OKAY, SO WHAT IF DONALD SAID TO

00:24:16,122 --> 00:24:19,359
MARIA, "WOW, HOW OFTEN ARE YOU

00:24:16,122 --> 00:24:19,359
GOING TO THE GYM?

480
00:24:19,359 --> 00:24:23,663
YOUR BODY IS SERIOUSLY

481
00:24:19,359 --> 00:24:23,663
FANTASTIC."

482
00:24:19,359 --> 00:24:23,663
>> THAT'S VERY INAPPROPRIATE.

483
00:24:23,663 --> 00:24:30,136
>> SORRY, NO.

484
00:24:23,663 --> 00:24:30,136
>> TRY TO REALLY FOCUS THIS

485
00:24:23,663 --> 00:24:30,136
TIME.

486
00:24:30,136 --> 00:24:35,642
MARIA COMES UP BEHIND DONALD AND

487
00:24:30,136 --> 00:24:35,642
SAYS, "DAMN, DO YOU LIVE AT THE

488
00:24:30,136 --> 00:24:35,642
GYM OR SOMETHING?

489

BECAUSE THAT JUICY BOOTY SLAPS."

490
00:24:35,642 --> 00:24:41,081
>> WILDLY INAPPROPRIATE.

491
00:24:35,642 --> 00:24:41,081
>> ACTUALLY, IT'S NOT.

492
00:24:41,081 --> 00:24:47,087
BECAUSE I'M HER BOSS.

493
00:24:41,081 --> 00:24:47,087
>> SEE?

494
00:24:41,081 --> 00:24:47,087
TRY TO REALLY LISTEN, GUYS.

495
00:24:47,087 --> 00:24:52,258
>> OKAY, WHAT IF MARIA'S BOSS

496
00:24:47,087 --> 00:24:52,258
SAID TO MARIA, "HEY, WHEN ARE

497
00:24:47,087 --> 00:24:52,258

THAT IS CLOCK IS TICKING, BABY."

500
00:24:52,258 --> 00:24:58,798

00:24:58,798 --> 00:25:05,105
>> BUT WHAT IF MY BOSS IS MY

502
00:24:58,798 --> 00:25:05,105
GRANDFATHER AND HE JUST REALLY

00:24:58,798 --> 00:25:05,105
WANTS GRANDKIDS?

504
00:25:05,105 --> 00:25:07,907
>> OKAY, BUT HE SHOULDN'T SAY IT

505
00:25:05,105 --> 00:25:07,907
AT WORK IN FRONT OF OTHER

506
00:25:05,105 --> 00:25:07,907
PEOPLE.

507
00:25:07,907 --> 00:25:16,549
>> AND WAIT, I THOUGHT DONALD

508
00:25:07,907 --> 00:25:16,549
WAS YOUR BOSS.

509
00:25:07,907 --> 00:25:16,549
>> "I THOUGHT DONALD WAS" -- YOU

510
00:25:16,549 --> 00:25:20,520
KNOW WHAT?

511
00:25:16,549 --> 00:25:20,520
THIS ISN'T A GAME, DEBORAH.

512
00:25:16,549 --> 00:25:20,520
NEXT SLIDE.

513
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:22,655
>> DONALD SAYS TO MARIA, "HEY,

514
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:22,655
N-WORD, ARE YOU GOING TO THE GYM

515
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:22,655
LATER?

516
00:25:22,655 --> 00:25:26,326
OR AM I GOING TO HAVE TO DRAG

517
00:25:22,655 --> 00:25:26,326
YOUR THICK ASS THERE MYSELF?"

518
00:25:22,655 --> 00:25:26,326
>> THAT'S REALLY AWFUL AND

519
00:25:26,326 --> 00:25:30,897
INAPPROPRIATE.

520
00:25:26,326 --> 00:25:30,897
>> ACTUALLY, IT'S FINE.

521
00:25:26,326 --> 00:25:30,897
>> ACTUALLY, IT'S NOT.

522
00:25:30,897 --> 00:25:36,069
>> NO, HE DIDN'T MEAN THAT "N"

523
00:25:30,897 --> 00:25:36,069
WORD.

524
00:25:30,897 --> 00:25:36,069
HE MEANT NICE.

525
00:25:36,069 --> 00:25:42,175
>> HE WAS SAYING, HEY NICE?

526
00:25:36,069 --> 00:25:42,175
>> YEAH.

527
00:25:36,069 --> 00:25:42,175
BECAUSE HE'S ITALIAN.

528
00:25:42,175 --> 00:25:45,679
HE SAID, "HEYA NICE."

529
00:25:42,175 --> 00:25:45,679
ALL THE TIME.

530
00:25:42,175 --> 00:25:45,679
>> THAT'S ALSO INAPPROPRIATE.

531
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:52,385
>> NOT IF SHE IS MY BOSS.

532

>> ALSO, WHY ARE ALL OF THESE

533

>> THE TWO OF US?

536
00:25:52,385 --> 00:25:59,793
THAT'S HOW YOU SEE IT?

537
00:25:59,793 --> 00:26:03,496
>> WOW, SO YOU SEE A MAN AND A

538
00:25:59,793 --> 00:26:03,496
WOMAN WORKING TOGETHER, SO

539
00:25:59,793 --> 00:26:03,496
AUTOMATICALLY YOU THINK THEY'RE

540
00:26:03,496 --> 00:26:08,868
HAVING RAW INTERCOURSE?

541
00:26:03,496 --> 00:26:08,868
>> NO ONE SAID THAT.

542
00:26:03,496 --> 00:26:08,868
>> YOU SEE A WOMAN IN A HOT

543

SKIRT SUIT, NOTHING UNDERNEATH,

544
00:26:08,868 --> 00:26:24,417
AND JUST BECAUSE YOUR EYES ARE

545
00:26:08,868 --> 00:26:24,417
GOING OWOOGA THINKING SHE'LL

547
00:26:24,417 --> 00:26:30,857
SANDWICH, THAT MEANS

548
00:26:24,417 --> 00:26:30,857
AUTOMATICALLY THEY'RE GOING TO

549
00:26:30,857 --> 00:26:33,560
HAVE RAW INTERCOURSE.

550
00:26:30,857 --> 00:26:33,560
>> STOP SAYING RAW INTERCOURSE!

551
00:26:30,857 --> 00:26:33,560
>> NO, SHUT UP, DEBORAH, SHUT

552
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:35,261
UP.

553
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:35,261
KEVIN WAS RIGHT ABOUT WHAT HE

554
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:35,261
SAID DURING THE INVESTIGATION,

555
00:26:35,261 --> 00:26:38,665
YOU ARE AN UPTIGHT BITCH.

556
00:26:35,261 --> 00:26:38,665
>> OH MY GOD, THIS IS HORRIBLE.

557
00:26:35,261 --> 00:26:38,665
>> EXACTLY.

558
00:26:38,665 --> 00:26:44,838
>> YOU HEAR THAT?

559
00:26:38,665 --> 00:26:44,838
THAT'S CLAPPING.

560
00:26:38,665 --> 00:26:44,838
>> WE'RE CLAPPING FOR YOU!

561
00:26:44,838 --> 00:26:48,141
BECAUSE WE'RE NOT YOUR HR

562
00:26:44,838 --> 00:26:48,141
REPRESENTATIVES.

563
00:26:44,838 --> 00:26:48,141
>> NO.

564
00:26:48,141 --> 00:26:52,078
WE'RE FROM A GROUP CALLED "IT

565
00:26:48,141 --> 00:26:52,078
COULD BE WORSE."

566

ENVIRONMENT MIGHT BE, IT COULD

569
00:26:52,078 --> 00:26:55,548
BE WORSE.

570
00:26:55,548 --> 00:27:02,555
>> COULD BE WAY WORSE.

571
00:26:55,548 --> 00:27:02,555
OKAY?

572
00:26:55,548 --> 00:27:02,555
>> WHAT ARE WE SUPPOSED TO DO

573
00:27:02,555 --> 00:27:09,329
WITH THIS INFORMATION?

574
00:27:02,555 --> 00:27:09,329

MAYBE EVEN A NEW WAY TO LOVE.

594
00:27:36,089 --> 00:27:39,426
>> YOU'LL WONDER, WHATEVER

595
00:27:36,089 --> 00:27:39,426
HAPPENED TO THOSE TWO?

596
00:27:36,089 --> 00:27:39,426
DID THEY END UP GOING TO THE

597
00:27:39,426 --> 00:27:44,364
MEN'S ROOM AND HAVING RAW

598

INTERCOURSE?

599
00:27:39,426 --> 00:27:44,364
>> AND THE ANSWER IS --

600
00:27:44,364 --> 00:27:51,905
YES.

601
00:27:44,364 --> 00:27:51,905

DEFINITELY.

618

HEY, UM, CAN I ASK SOMETHING?

619
00:28:15,328 --> 00:28:19,366
>> ANYTHING.

620
00:28:19,366 --> 00:28:26,039
>> WHY DO YOU ALWAYS WEAR THAT

621
00:28:19,366 --> 00:28:26,039
GREEN RIBBON AROUND YOUR NECK?

622
00:28:19,366 --> 00:28:26,039
>> UM, WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

623
00:28:26,039 --> 00:28:32,345
>> I'VE JUST NEVER SEEN YOU

624
00:28:26,039 --> 00:28:32,345
WITHOUT IT.

625
00:28:26,039 --> 00:28:32,345
WHY DON'T YOU TAKE IT OFF?

626
00:28:32,345 --> 00:28:36,483
>> I HOPED YOU WOULDN'T NOTICE.

LOOK, ALAN, I'LL SHOW YOU.

00:28:36,483 --> 00:28:44,190
THE WAY YOU SEE ME.

630
00:28:36,483 --> 00:28:44,190

THERE'S A LITTLE MEATBALL GUY ON

636
00:28:49,963 --> 00:28:53,933
THE SIDE OF MY NECK.

637

MIDDLE SCHOOL IN THE '90s

00:39:14,268 --> 00:39:20,324
 I WAS
SOME -- I WAS KIND OF LIKE
TORTURED BY THE CONSTANT USE OF

"THAT'S SO GAY.
EW, YOU'RE GAY."

HAS TAKEN A STAND

YOU CANNOT SAY GAY IN SCHOOL

AND IN FLORIDA OF ALL PLACES.

936
00:39:41,528 --> 00:39:44,903
SO ACTUALLY, I FEEL LIKE THERE'S
BEEN A MISUNDERSTANDING.

937
00:39:44,903 --> 00:39:50,671
THE LAW ACTUALLY MEANS THAT YOU
CAN'T ACKNOWLEDGE THAT GAY
EXISTS AT ALL.

00:39:53,676 --> 00:39:55,430
>> WHAT?

939

>> YEAH.
LIKE TEACHERS CAN'T SPEAK ABOUT
GAY PEOPLE IN HISTORY.

940
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:02,189
OR IF A KID HAS A GAY FAMILY
MEMBER.

941
00:40:02,189 --> 00:40:04,266
>> WHAT?

942
00:40:04,266 --> 00:40:07,304
>> YEAH, AND IF A KID CONFIDES
THAT THEY'RE GAY TO A TEACHER,

943
00:40:07,304 --> 00:40:10,293
THE TEACHER HAS TO OUT THEM TO
THEIR PARENTS.

944
00:40:10,478 --> 00:40:13,257

>> YEAH, SORRY TO BREAK THIS TO
YOU.

00:40:16,316 --> 00:40:19,919
>> YEAH.

949
00:40:19,919 --> 00:40:21,488
OKAY.

950
00:40:19,919 --> 00:40:21,488

951
00:40:19,919 --> 00:40:21,488

IT'S JUST THAT THING OF LIKE

953
00:40:21,488 --> 00:40:25,225
WHEN THEY SAY DON'T SAY GAY, YOU

954
00:40:21,488 --> 00:40:25,225
KNOW, THEN IT'S LIKE STUCK IN

955
00:40:25,225 --> 00:40:29,829
YOUR HEAD.

956
00:40:25,225 --> 00:40:29,829
BUT IT'S FINE.

957
00:40:25,225 --> 00:40:29,829
>> OKAY.

958
00:40:29,829 --> 00:40:35,368
>> ANYWAY, I AM DEEPLY GAY OF --

959

SORRY.

960

TO MAKE KIDS GAY AND TRANS --

964

SORRY, DEPRESSED AND SUICIDAL.

965
00:40:42,642 --> 00:40:46,079
AND I THINK THESE LAWS ARE

966
00:40:42,642 --> 00:40:46,079
LESBIANS.

967
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:49,983
SORRY, UNCONSCIONABLE.

968
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:49,983

00:46:27,854 --> 00:46:32,559
YOU WANT TO SEE MY HEELS,

1142
00:46:27,854 --> 00:46:32,559
MICHAEL?

1143
00:46:27,854 --> 00:46:32,559
THESE.

1144
00:46:32,559 --> 00:46:36,663
I USED TO WEAR A SIZE 9.

1145
00:46:32,559 --> 00:46:36,663
NOW I'M A MEN'S 15.

1146
00:46:36,663 --> 00:46:42,068
YOU KNOW I EVEN GOT MY TUBES

1147
00:46:36,663 --> 00:46:42,068
TIED.

1148
00:46:36,663 --> 00:46:42,068
BUT THEY CAME LOOSE.

1149
00:46:42,068 --> 00:46:47,207
I KEEP BEGGING MY DOCTOR, DOUBLE

1150
00:46:42,068 --> 00:46:47,207
KNOT THEM NEXT TIME, PLEASE.

1151
00:46:42,068 --> 00:46:47,207
>> THEY TIED THEM LIKE

1152
00:46:47,207 --> 00:46:49,342
SHOELACES?

1153
00:46:47,207 --> 00:46:49,342
>> LOOK, I'M OUT HERE ON MY OWN,

1154
00:46:47,207 --> 00:46:49,342
MICHAEL.

1155
00:46:49,342 --> 00:46:53,079
AT LEAST RIHANNA'S GOT A

1156
00:46:49,342 --> 00:46:53,079
BOYFRIEND BY HER SIDE.

1157
00:46:49,342 --> 00:46:53,079
MEANWHILE, YOU HAVEN'T COME WITH

1158
00:46:53,079 --> 00:46:58,618
ME TO NOT ONE DOCTOR'S

1159
00:46:53,079 --> 00:46:58,618
APPOINTMENT.

1160
00:46:58,618 --> 00:47:02,555
>> WAIT, WHY WOULD I?

1161
00:46:58,618 --> 00:47:02,555
>> BECAUSE YOU DID THIS TO ME.

1162
00:46:58,618 --> 00:47:02,555
>> I DID?

1163
00:47:02,555 --> 00:47:08,495
>> MM-HMM.

1164
00:47:02,555 --> 00:47:08,495
I SAID LET'S USE PROTECTION.

1165
00:47:02,555 --> 00:47:08,495
AND YOU LOOKED ME IN THE EYE AND

1166
00:47:08,495 --> 00:47:13,133
SAID "IT DON'T FEEL THE SAME."

1167
00:47:08,495 --> 00:47:13,133
>> THAT DOES SOUND LIKE ME, YES.

1168
00:47:13,133 --> 00:47:16,903
>> ALL RIGHT, YOU KNOW, I'VE GOT

1169
00:47:13,133 --> 00:47:16,903
TO GO.

1170
00:47:13,133 --> 00:47:16,903
I LEFT MY KIDS IN LORNE'S

1171
00:47:16,903 --> 00:47:19,739
OFFICE.

1172
00:47:16,903 --> 00:47:19,739
>> PAULINE, EVERYBODY.

1173
00:47:16,903 --> 00:47:19,739
>> I'M YOUNGER THAN RIHANNA.

1174
00:47:19,739 --> 00:47:22,275
I'M ONLY 29.

1175
00:47:19,739 --> 00:47:22,275
For "Weekend Update," I'm

1176
00:47:19,739 --> 00:47:22,275
Colin Jost.

1177
00:47:22,275 --> 00:47:23,843
For "Weekend Update," I'm

1178
00:47:22,275 --> 00:47:23,843
Colin Jost.

1179
00:47:22,275 --> 00:47:23,843
>> I'm Michael Che. Good night.

1180
00:47:34,220 --> 00:47:38,625
YOU KNOW, OVER MY TEN YEARS ON

1181
00:47:34,220 --> 00:47:38,625
THE SHOW, I HAVE PLAYED DOZENS

1182
00:47:34,220 --> 00:47:38,625
OF TEACHERS, PRINCIPALS,

1183
00:47:38,625 --> 00:47:44,464
MOTHERS, WOMEN NAMED DIANE,

1184
00:47:38,625 --> 00:47:44,464
SUSAN, OR TEACHER.

1185
00:47:38,625 --> 00:47:44,464
AND I HAVE LOVED ALL OF THESE

1186
00:47:44,464 --> 00:47:50,070
SWEET, NURTURING WOMEN.

1187
00:47:44,464 --> 00:47:50,070
BUT THE SHOW SAID THAT IF I

1188
00:47:44,464 --> 00:47:50,070
PLAYED 150 OF THEM, THEN AS A

1189
00:47:50,070 --> 00:47:56,176
REWARD I COULD WRITE A SKETCH OF

1190
00:47:50,070 --> 00:47:56,176
MY OWN CHOOSING.

1191
00:47:50,070 --> 00:47:56,176
YOU KNOW, TO SHOW A DIFFERENT

1192
00:47:56,176 --> 00:48:00,513
SIDE OF MYSELF.

1193
00:47:56,176 --> 00:48:00,513
SO TONIGHT, THIS IS THAT SKETCH.

1194
00:47:56,176 --> 00:48:00,513
ENJOY.

1195
00:48:00,513 --> 00:48:06,886
>> I'M SO NERVOUS, I CAN'T

1196
00:48:00,513 --> 00:48:06,886
BELIEVE SIEGFRIED'S GOING TO

1197
00:48:06,886 --> 00:48:11,491
TAKE ME, A LOSER AND A FOOL.

1198
00:48:06,886 --> 00:48:11,491
HOW DO I LOOK?

1199
00:48:06,886 --> 00:48:11,491
>> YOU LOOK FANTASTIC, SIR.

1200
00:48:11,491 --> 00:48:16,029
I'M SURE SHE'LL BE TITILLATED.

1201
00:48:11,491 --> 00:48:16,029
>> BUT YOU'RE RIGHT TO BE

1202
00:48:11,491 --> 00:48:16,029
SCARED.

1203
00:48:16,029 --> 00:48:23,636
SHE IS THE MOST WIDELY DESIRED

1204
00:48:16,029 --> 00:48:23,636
WOMAN IN THE WORLD.

1205
00:48:16,029 --> 00:48:23,636
>> OH, I'M SICK.

1206
00:48:23,636 --> 00:48:26,639
I'M SICK WITH FEELING FOR THIS

1207
00:48:23,636 --> 00:48:26,639
WOMAN.

1208
00:48:26,639 --> 00:48:31,211
IT'S HER.

1209
00:48:26,639 --> 00:48:31,211
PRAY FOR ME BOYS.

1210
00:48:26,639 --> 00:48:31,211
**

1211
00:48:31,211 --> 00:48:33,780
>> HELLO.

1212
00:48:31,211 --> 00:48:33,780
NOW, SCRAM, BOYS, AND LEAVE THIS

1213
00:48:33,780 --> 00:48:38,284
MAN TO ME.

1214
00:48:33,780 --> 00:48:38,284
>> MY GOD.

1215
00:48:33,780 --> 00:48:38,284
YOU ARE SO BEAUTIFUL.

1216
00:48:38,284 --> 00:48:45,825
AND SEXUAL.

1217
00:48:38,284 --> 00:48:45,825
AND I CAN TELL YOUR

1218
00:48:38,284 --> 00:48:45,825
PERSONALITY'S ALSO REALLY GOOD.

1219
00:48:45,825 --> 00:48:50,063
>> OH GOD, IF I HAD A NICKEL FOR

1220
00:48:45,825 --> 00:48:50,063
EVERY TIME I HEARD A MAN SAY

1221
00:48:45,825 --> 00:48:50,063
THAT, I WOULD HAVE SO MANY COINS

1222
00:48:50,063 --> 00:48:56,603
THAT IT WOULD BE ANNOYING.

1223
00:48:50,063 --> 00:48:56,603
>> OH, SENSUAL WOMAN.

1224
00:48:50,063 --> 00:48:56,603
YOU MAKE ME SO HORNY.

1225
00:48:56,603 --> 00:49:03,109
I SEE WHY THEY CALL YOU THE

1226
00:48:56,603 --> 00:49:03,109
SEXUAL WOMAN.

1227
00:48:56,603 --> 00:49:03,109
>> SO YEAH, I LIED TO

1228
00:49:03,109 --> 00:49:07,647
OSCAR ISAAC.

1229
00:49:03,109 --> 00:49:07,647
I TOLD HIM I HAVE A FAMOUS

1230
00:49:03,109 --> 00:49:07,647
RECURRING CHARACTER ON THE SHOW

1231
00:49:07,647 --> 00:49:15,488
CALLED "THE SEXUAL WOMAN."

1232
00:49:07,647 --> 00:49:15,488
IS THAT A CRIME?

1233
00:49:07,647 --> 00:49:15,488
**

1234
00:49:15,488 --> 00:49:23,329
>> OH, I'M THE LUCKIEST MAN ON

1235
00:49:15,488 --> 00:49:23,329
EARTH TO BE BRUSHING YOUR HAIR.

1236
00:49:15,488 --> 00:49:23,329
MIND IF I GET A LITTLE CLOSER?

1237
00:49:23,329 --> 00:49:31,838
>> OH, SURE.

1238
00:49:23,329 --> 00:49:31,838
BRING YOUR HEAD AND BODY THAT

1239
00:49:23,329 --> 00:49:31,838
LOOK LIKE THAT CLOSER TO ME,

1240
00:49:31,838 --> 00:49:33,640
WHATEVER.

1241
00:49:31,838 --> 00:49:33,640
I DON'T CARE.

1242
00:49:31,838 --> 00:49:33,640
>> I NEED YOU TO KNOW, I SEE YOU

1243
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:37,911
SEXUALLY.

1244
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:37,911
I DON'T SEE YOU AS SOMEONE WHO

1245
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:37,911
WOULD, LIKE, RUN A SCHOOL.

1246
00:49:37,911 --> 00:49:45,185
I MEAN, YOU ARE THE MOST UNDER

1247
00:49:37,911 --> 00:49:45,185
35 PERSON I'VE EVER MET.

1248
00:49:37,911 --> 00:49:45,185
>> OH, STOP IT, YOU FLIRT.

1249
00:49:45,185 --> 00:49:49,689
>> WELL, I BET YOU WERE ABOUT TO

1250
00:49:45,185 --> 00:49:49,689
DO YOUR BIG CATCHPHRASE.

1251
00:49:45,185 --> 00:49:49,689
>> UH -- OH, RIGHT.

1252
00:49:49,689 --> 00:49:57,364
YES.

1253
00:49:49,689 --> 00:49:57,364
MY FAMOUS CATCHPHRASE.

1254
00:49:49,689 --> 00:49:57,364
OF COURSE.

1255
00:49:57,364 --> 00:50:02,168
WHAT WAS IT?

1256
00:49:57,364 --> 00:50:02,168
HERE WE GO.

1257
00:49:57,364 --> 00:50:02,168
HEY, GET YOUR FAT ASS ON MY LAP,

1258
00:50:02,168 --> 00:50:06,339
BITCH!

1259
00:50:02,168 --> 00:50:06,339
>> OKAY.

1260
00:50:02,168 --> 00:50:06,339
YES.

1261
00:50:06,339 --> 00:50:16,249
>> OOH.

1262
00:50:06,339 --> 00:50:16,249
>> I MUST CONFESS, I HAVE A BIG

1263
00:50:06,339 --> 00:50:16,249
I MUST CONFESS, I HAVE A BIG,

1264
00:50:16,249 --> 00:50:22,922
COOL BONER RIGHT NOW WHICH I

1265
00:50:16,249 --> 00:50:22,922
SOMETIMES GET WHEN I RESPECT

1266
00:50:16,249 --> 00:50:22,922
SOMEONE TOO MUCH.

1267
00:50:22,922 --> 00:50:25,525
>> NOW, WHY DID I CHOOSE

1268
00:50:22,922 --> 00:50:25,525
OSCAR ISAAC FOR THE SKETCH?

1269
00:50:22,922 --> 00:50:25,525
NO REASON.

1270
00:50:25,525 --> 00:50:29,129
I MEAN, PRETTY RANDOM.

1271
00:50:25,525 --> 00:50:29,129
EVERY TIME I'VE DONE SOMETHING

1272
00:50:25,525 --> 00:50:29,129
ROMANTIC ON THE SHOW, IT'S BEEN

1273
00:50:29,129 --> 00:50:34,000
TOTALLY RANDOM.

1274
00:50:29,129 --> 00:50:34,000
LIKE WITH RYAN GOSLING.

1275
00:50:29,129 --> 00:50:34,000
OR DRAKE.

1276
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:40,140
OH, MY GOD.

1277
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:40,140
DO I HAVE A PATTERN OF SEXUAL

1278
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:40,140
RANDOMNESS?

1279
00:50:40,140 --> 00:50:48,148
WELL, WHATEVER.

1280
00:50:40,140 --> 00:50:48,148
YOU ONLY LIVE ONCE.

1281
00:50:40,140 --> 00:50:48,148
NOW BACK TO THE SKETCH.

1282
00:50:48,148 --> 00:50:54,454
>> IS THE FOOD ALL RIGHT?

1283
00:50:48,148 --> 00:50:54,454
I HOPE YOU EVEN LIKE SPAGHETTI.

1284
00:50:48,148 --> 00:50:54,454
>> YOU'RE LUCKY THAT I DO.

1285
00:50:54,454 --> 00:50:58,358
>> DAMN IT, I'M IN LOVE WITH YOU

1286
00:50:54,454 --> 00:50:58,358
AND IT'S KILLING ME!

1287
00:50:54,454 --> 00:50:58,358
>> OH!

1288
00:50:58,358 --> 00:51:02,228
YES.

1289
00:50:58,358 --> 00:51:02,228
TO ME THIS IS NORMAL BEHAVIOR.

1290
00:50:58,358 --> 00:51:02,228
>> I WROTE A SONG FOR YOU, IF

1291
00:51:02,228 --> 00:51:10,937
THAT'S OKAY.

1292
00:51:02,228 --> 00:51:10,937
**

1293
00:51:02,228 --> 00:51:10,937
* SEXUAL WOMAN ARE YOU FROM

1294
00:51:10,937 --> 00:51:15,342
PARIS OR BARCELONA *

1295
00:51:10,937 --> 00:51:15,342
* NO I'M FROM ARIZONA *

1296
00:51:10,937 --> 00:51:15,342
* SEXUAL WOMAN I RESPECT YOU

1297
00:51:15,342 --> 00:51:24,818
SO MUCH I'VE JUST

1298
00:51:15,342 --> 00:51:24,818
DEMONSTRATED BY MY INSANE

1299
00:51:15,342 --> 00:51:24,818
BONER *

1300
00:51:24,818 --> 00:51:28,955
>> OH.

1301
00:51:24,818 --> 00:51:28,955
A BONER?

1302
00:51:24,818 --> 00:51:28,955
LET ME GUESS.

1303
00:51:28,955 --> 00:51:32,592
YOU WANT TO KISS ME NOW.

1304
00:51:28,955 --> 00:51:32,592
>> YES, I DO.

1305
00:51:28,955 --> 00:51:32,592
BUT NOT YET.

1306
00:51:32,592 --> 00:51:40,500
YOU NEED TIME TO DIGEST ALL THAT

1307
00:51:32,592 --> 00:51:40,500
SPAGHETTI.

1308
00:51:32,592 --> 00:51:40,500
SO NOW COULD WE JUST HUG?

1309
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:43,103
>> YES, GOOD IDEA.

1310
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:43,103
I WOULD HAVE FORGOTTEN TO DIGEST

1311
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:43,103
AND REGRETTED IT LATER.

1312
00:51:43,103 --> 00:51:49,976
>> OH, WHAT THEY SAY ABOUT YOU

1313
00:51:43,103 --> 00:51:49,976
IS TRUE.

1314
00:51:43,103 --> 00:51:49,976
YOU ARE EVERYONE'S CUP OF TEA.

1315
00:51:49,976 --> 00:51:54,881
INCLUDING ME, OSCAR ISAAC.

1316
00:51:49,976 --> 00:51:54,881
>> OH, I KNOW, OSCAR ISAAC.

1317
00:51:49,976 --> 00:51:54,881
>> SORRY.

1318
00:51:54,881 --> 00:51:58,651
IS THAT -- IT SAYS MY REAL NAME

1319
00:51:54,881 --> 00:51:58,651
ON THE CARD.

1320
00:51:54,881 --> 00:51:58,651
IS THAT A MISTAKE?

1321
00:51:58,651 --> 00:52:03,523
>> I DON'T KNOW.

1322
00:51:58,651 --> 00:52:03,523
I GUESS -- THE WRITERS ARE SO

1323
00:51:58,651 --> 00:52:03,523
ANNOYING AND STUPID.

1324
00:52:03,523 --> 00:52:05,525
I WOULD SAY I GUESS JUSTIFY GO

1325
00:52:03,523 --> 00:52:05,525
WITH IT?

1326
00:52:03,523 --> 00:52:05,525
>> OKAY.

1327
00:52:05,525 --> 00:52:13,133
ALL RIGHT.

1328
00:52:05,525 --> 00:52:13,133
THEN LET'S GET MY FAT ASS ON

1329
00:52:05,525 --> 00:52:13,133
YOUR LAP.

1330
00:52:13,133 --> 00:52:16,236
YOUR LAP.

1331
00:52:13,133 --> 00:52:16,236
>> YES.

1332
00:52:13,133 --> 00:52:16,236
**

1333
00:52:29,315 --> 00:52:31,584
* YOU THOUGHT YOU

1334
00:52:29,315 --> 00:52:31,584
COULD FIX IT

1335
00:52:29,315 --> 00:52:31,584
BY YOURSELF *

1336
00:52:31,584 --> 00:52:34,554
* PLUMBING'S JUST AS EASY

1337
00:52:31,584 --> 00:52:34,554
AS BUILDING A SHELF *

1338
00:52:31,584 --> 00:52:34,554
* YOUR DIY BECOMES OMG

1339
00:52:34,554 --> 00:52:42,562
YOU'RE IN OVER YOUR HEAD *

1340
00:52:34,554 --> 00:52:42,562
>>> WELL, HELLO.

1341
00:52:34,554 --> 00:52:42,562
I'M GUS VANZANT.

1342
00:52:42,562 --> 00:52:49,235
AND WELCOME TO "IN OVER YOUR

1343
00:52:42,562 --> 00:52:49,235
HEAD" WHERE WE TALK TO FOLKS WHO

1344
00:52:42,562 --> 00:52:49,235
GOT A LITTLE OVERCONFIDENT

1345
00:52:49,235 --> 00:52:52,672
TAKING ON PROJECTS AROUND THE

1346
00:52:49,235 --> 00:52:52,672
HOUSE.

1347
00:52:49,235 --> 00:52:52,672
SPONSORED BY THUMB ICE.

1348
00:52:52,672 --> 00:52:59,846
DID YOU WHACK YOUR THUMB WITH A

1349
00:52:52,672 --> 00:52:59,846
HAMMER LIKE A CARTOON IDIOT?

1350
00:52:52,672 --> 00:52:59,846
NUMB THE PAIN WITH THUMB ICE.

1351
00:52:59,846 --> 00:53:01,781
OUR FIRST GUEST IS TOMMY DORIAN,

1352
00:52:59,846 --> 00:53:01,781
WHO SAID HE TRIED TO INSTALL HIS

1353
00:52:59,846 --> 00:53:01,781
OWN POOL.

1354
00:53:01,781 --> 00:53:07,787
UH-OH.

1355
00:53:01,781 --> 00:53:07,787
COME ON IN, TOMMY.

1356
00:53:01,781 --> 00:53:07,787
**

1357
00:53:07,787 --> 00:53:10,757
ALL RIGHT.

1358
00:53:07,787 --> 00:53:10,757
WELL, LOOKS LIKE YOUR HAIR'S

1359
00:53:07,787 --> 00:53:10,757
STILL A LITTLE WET FROM THE POOL

1360
00:53:10,757 --> 00:53:16,162
THERE, TOMMY.

1361
00:53:10,757 --> 00:53:16,162
>> NO, THAT'S UNRELATED.

1362
00:53:16,162 --> 00:53:24,304
>> OKAY.

1363
00:53:16,162 --> 00:53:24,304
SO TELL US, WHAT WAS BEHIND YOUR

1364
00:53:16,162 --> 00:53:24,304
THINKING BEHIND BUILDING YOUR

1365
00:53:24,304 --> 00:53:26,339
OWN POOL?

1366
00:53:24,304 --> 00:53:26,339
>> WELL, MY NEIGHBOR PUT ONE IN.

1367
00:53:24,304 --> 00:53:26,339
HIRED A WHOLE CREW AND AN

1368
00:53:26,339 --> 00:53:28,108
ARCHITECT.

1369
00:53:26,339 --> 00:53:28,108
THE WHOLE NINE YARDS.

1370
00:53:26,339 --> 00:53:28,108
I THOUGHT, IT'S BASICALLY A HOLE

1371
00:53:28,108 --> 00:53:31,845
PLUS A HOSE.

1372
00:53:28,108 --> 00:53:31,845
WHY OVERTHINK IT?

1373
00:53:28,108 --> 00:53:31,845
>> UH-HUH.

1374
00:53:31,845 --> 00:53:36,149
AND WHEN DID THINGS GO WRONG?

1375
00:53:31,845 --> 00:53:36,149
>> ALMOST IMMEDIATELY, GUS.

1376
00:53:31,845 --> 00:53:36,149
MY PROBLEM STARTED WHEN I TRIED

1377
00:53:36,149 --> 00:53:39,686
TO POUR THE CONCRETE WHILE I WAS

1378
00:53:36,149 --> 00:53:39,686
STILL DIGGING, TO SAVE TIME.

1379
00:53:36,149 --> 00:53:39,686
>> OH, WOW.

1380
00:53:39,686 --> 00:53:43,656
>> OH WOW IS RIGHT.

1381
00:53:39,686 --> 00:53:43,656
CUT TO, I'M UP TO MY WAIST IN

1382
00:53:39,686 --> 00:53:43,656
HARD CONCRETE SCREAMING, "HELP!

1383
00:53:43,656 --> 00:53:46,659
SOMEONE TURN OFF THE HOSE!"

1384
00:53:43,656 --> 00:53:46,659
>> SO YOU WERE ALREADY RUNNING

1385
00:53:43,656 --> 00:53:46,659
THE HOSE?

1386
00:53:46,659 --> 00:53:51,231
>> TO FILL THE POOL, TO SAVE

1387
00:53:46,659 --> 00:53:51,231
TIME, YES.

1388
00:53:46,659 --> 00:53:51,231
HAD TO HAVE IT OPEN FOR NEW

1389
00:53:51,231 --> 00:53:54,200
YEAR'S.

1390
00:53:51,231 --> 00:53:54,200
>> WELL, LOOKING BACK, ANY

1391
00:53:51,231 --> 00:53:54,200
REGRETS?

1392
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:58,271
>> I DO WISH I HADN'T PUNCTURED

1393
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:58,271
MY SEPTIC TANK.

1394
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:58,271
THAT'S A WHOLE DIFFERENT KIND OF

1395
00:53:58,271 --> 00:54:14,621
POOL.

1396
00:53:58,271 --> 00:54:14,621
>> THANKS FOR COMING, TOMMY.

1397
00:53:58,271 --> 00:54:14,621
>> THANKS FOR ALLOWING ME.

1398
00:54:14,621 --> 00:54:17,157
>> ALL RIGHT.

1399
00:54:17,157 --> 00:54:20,060
OUR NEXT GUEST THOUGHT THAT HE

1400
00:54:17,157 --> 00:54:20,060
SHOULD, QUOTE, DO HIS OWN

1401
00:54:17,157 --> 00:54:20,060
ELECTRICAL.

1402
00:54:20,060 --> 00:54:27,334
PLEASE WELCOME FELIX CREWE!

1403
00:54:20,060 --> 00:54:27,334
**

1404
00:54:20,060 --> 00:54:27,334
>> HEY GUS.

1405
00:54:27,334 --> 00:54:35,709
LONG TIME, FIRST TIME.

1406
00:54:27,334 --> 00:54:35,709
>> YOU MEAN, LONG TIME WATCH,

1407
00:54:27,334 --> 00:54:35,709
FIRST-TIME GUEST?

1408
00:54:35,709 --> 00:54:38,845
>> NO.

1409
00:54:35,709 --> 00:54:38,845
FIRST TIME ELECTROCUTED.

1410
00:54:35,709 --> 00:54:38,845
LONG TIME IT HURT.

1411
00:54:38,845 --> 00:54:41,481
>> SO, HOW DID YOU DECIDE TO DO

1412
00:54:38,845 --> 00:54:41,481
YOUR OWN ELECTRICAL WORK?

1413
00:54:41,481 --> 00:54:43,249
>> WELL, I KEEP TELLING MY WIFE,

1414
00:54:41,481 --> 00:54:43,249
IT'S JUST WIRES.

1415
00:54:41,481 --> 00:54:43,249
BABE, IT'S JUST WIRES.

1416
00:54:43,249 --> 00:54:48,988
HONEY, NOTHING'S GOING TO

1417
00:54:43,249 --> 00:54:48,988
HAPPEN, IT'S WIRES.

1418
00:54:43,249 --> 00:54:48,988
>> RIGHT.

1419
00:54:48,988 --> 00:54:53,393
>> YOU KNOW WHEN YOU SEE A GUY

1420
00:54:48,988 --> 00:54:53,393
DEFUSING BOMBS IN THE MOVIES YOU

1421
00:54:48,988 --> 00:54:53,393
THINK, I COULD DO THAT?

1422
00:54:53,393 --> 00:54:56,830
>> I'VE NEVER THOUGHT THAT.

1423
00:54:53,393 --> 00:54:56,830
>> WELL, I HAVE A LOT.

1424
00:54:53,393 --> 00:54:56,830
SO I THOUGHT, "WHAT THE HELL,

1425
00:54:56,830 --> 00:55:00,600
I'M GOING TO INSTALL MY OWN

1426
00:54:56,830 --> 00:55:00,600
CIRCUIT BREAKER."

1427
00:54:56,830 --> 00:55:00,600
>> OH, MY GOD.

1428
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:07,941
>> NO, TRUST ME, THERE IS NO

1429
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:07,941
GOD.

1430
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:07,941
NOW, THE WHOLE IDEA OF A BREAKER

1431
00:55:07,941 --> 00:55:13,680
IS TO STOP A POWER SURGE, RIGHT?

1432
00:55:07,941 --> 00:55:13,680
SO, I THINK I SHOULD START WITH

1433
00:55:07,941 --> 00:55:13,680
THE POWER DIALED ALL THE WAY UP

1434
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:16,850
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT I'M TRYING

1435
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:16,850
TO PROTECT MYSELF AGAINST,

1436
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:16,850
RIGHT?

1437
00:55:16,850 --> 00:55:20,320
>> THAT IS VERY BAD LOGIC.

1438
00:55:16,850 --> 00:55:20,320
>> SO I GOT THIS THING CRANKED

1439
00:55:16,850 --> 00:55:20,320
UP HIGHER THAN LIGHTNING AND I'M

1440
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:27,527
LIKE, "TIME TO SCREW IN THE

1441
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:27,527
METAL SCREWS," RIGHT?

1442
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:27,527
>> NO, NOT RIGHT.

1443
00:55:27,527 --> 00:55:33,667
>> CUT TO -- I FLY SO HARD

1444
00:55:27,527 --> 00:55:33,667
THROUGH A SHEET OF DRYWALL THAT

1445
00:55:27,527 --> 00:55:33,667
MY SCREAM PHYSICALLY DETACHES

1446
00:55:33,667 --> 00:55:35,735
FROM MY BODY AND TRAVELS AT A

1447
00:55:33,667 --> 00:55:35,735
SLOWER SPEED.

1448
00:55:33,667 --> 00:55:35,735
KIND OF LIKE PETER PAN'S SHADOW

1449
00:55:35,735 --> 00:55:40,840
DETACHING FROM HIS BODY.

1450
00:55:35,735 --> 00:55:40,840
>> YEAH, GOT IT.

1451
00:55:35,735 --> 00:55:40,840
>> SO AFTER I HIT A STEEL

1452
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:46,212
SUPPORT COLUMN, WIPING OUT THE

1453
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:46,212
ENTIRE FIRST FLOOR OF MY HOME, I

1454
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:46,212
AM HIT IN THE FACE BY MY OWN

1455
00:55:46,212 --> 00:55:51,918
SCREAM.

1456
00:55:46,212 --> 00:55:51,918
WILD, RIGHT?

1457
00:55:46,212 --> 00:55:51,918
>> WOW.

1458
00:55:51,918 --> 00:55:53,987
AND WHAT DID YOU LEARN FROM ALL

1459
00:55:51,918 --> 00:55:53,987
OF THIS?

1460
00:55:51,918 --> 00:55:53,987
>> GLOVES.

1461
00:55:53,987 --> 00:56:04,431
YOU'VE GOT TO WEAR GLOVES.

1462
00:55:53,987 --> 00:56:04,431
>> WELL, THANK YOU, FELIX.

1463
00:55:53,987 --> 00:56:04,431
>> EXCITED TO GET MY CHECK.

1464
00:56:04,431 --> 00:56:06,866
>> THERE'S NO CHECK.

1465
00:56:04,431 --> 00:56:06,866
>> ALL RIGHT.

1466
00:56:06,866 --> 00:56:11,237
AND OUR FINAL GUEST SAYS THAT

1467
00:56:06,866 --> 00:56:11,237
SHE'S BEEN TRYING TO REPAIR HER

1468
00:56:06,866 --> 00:56:11,237
HOME FOR MONTHS.

1469
00:56:11,237 --> 00:56:15,308
PLEASE WELCOME -- THIS CAN'T BE

1470
00:56:11,237 --> 00:56:15,308
RIGHT.

1471
00:56:11,237 --> 00:56:15,308
MY WIFE CARLISA.

1472
00:56:15,308 --> 00:56:19,679
**

1473
00:56:15,308 --> 00:56:19,679
HEY, BABY.

1474
00:56:15,308 --> 00:56:19,679
UH, WHAT YOU DOING HERE?

1475
00:56:19,679 --> 00:56:24,417
>> JUST TRYING TO REPAIR MY

1476
00:56:19,679 --> 00:56:24,417
HOME.

1477
00:56:19,679 --> 00:56:24,417
THIS DAMN FOOL IS OUT HERE

1478
00:56:24,417 --> 00:56:28,822
PRETENDING HE'S A BIG EXPERT.

1479
00:56:24,417 --> 00:56:28,822
MEANWHILE, HIS OWN HOUSE IS

1480
00:56:24,417 --> 00:56:28,822
LITERALLY FALLING APART.

1481
00:56:28,822 --> 00:56:32,692
>> WELL, IF YOU HAVE A PROBLEM,

1482
00:56:28,822 --> 00:56:32,692
BABY, I'M HAPPY TO FIX IT.

1483
00:56:28,822 --> 00:56:32,692
>> WITH WHAT?

1484
00:56:32,692 --> 00:56:36,696
THIS IS YOUR TOOLBOX.

1485
00:56:32,692 --> 00:56:36,696
BUT THERE AREN'T NO TOOLS IN

1486
00:56:32,692 --> 00:56:36,696
HERE, THOUGH.

1487
00:56:36,696 --> 00:56:39,833
IT'S JUST CANS OF BLACK'S BEER.

1488
00:56:36,696 --> 00:56:39,833
>> HEY, I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR

1489
00:56:36,696 --> 00:56:39,833
THOSE.

1490
00:56:39,833 --> 00:56:45,672
>> THERE'S NO TOOLS IN THIS

1491
00:56:39,833 --> 00:56:45,672
WHOLE GOOFY-ASS WORKSHOP.

1492
00:56:39,833 --> 00:56:45,672
IT'S JUST CHOCOLATE BARS THAT

1493
00:56:45,672 --> 00:56:50,343
LOOK LIKE TOOLS.

1494
00:56:45,672 --> 00:56:50,343
>> WELL, SOMETIMES I GET A

1495
00:56:45,672 --> 00:56:50,343
LITTLE HUNGRY.

1496
00:56:50,343 --> 00:56:53,079
>> MEANWHILE, OUR TOILET HASN'T

1497
00:56:50,343 --> 00:56:53,079
WORKED IN MONTHS.

1498
00:56:50,343 --> 00:56:53,079
I OPENED THE LID OF THE TANK AND

1499
00:56:53,079 --> 00:57:02,188
SAW THIS.

1500
00:56:53,079 --> 00:57:02,188
>> WELL, YOU NEVER KNOW WHEN YOU

1501
00:56:53,079 --> 00:57:02,188
MIGHT NEED AN ICE COLD HOT DOG.

1502
00:57:02,188 --> 00:57:07,327
>> AND THEN YOU SNUCK SOME

1503
00:57:02,188 --> 00:57:07,327
CRUSHED UP PEANUT SHELLS INTO

1504
00:57:02,188 --> 00:57:07,327
OUR SON'S LUNCH TO PROVE THAT HE

1505
00:57:07,327 --> 00:57:21,574
WAS FAKING HIS PEANUT ALLERGY.

1506
00:57:07,327 --> 00:57:21,574
>> WELL, THE IMPORTANT THING IS

1507
00:57:07,327 --> 00:57:21,574
THAT I TRUST YOU NOW.

1508
00:57:21,574 --> 00:57:24,044
I STILL THINK HE MAY BE

1509
00:57:21,574 --> 00:57:24,044
EXAGGERATING A LITTLE BIT.

1510
00:57:21,574 --> 00:57:24,044
>> GUS.

1511
00:57:24,044 --> 00:57:25,879
WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO SAY FOR

1512
00:57:24,044 --> 00:57:25,879
YOURSELF?

1513
00:57:24,044 --> 00:57:25,879
>> LOOK.

1514
00:57:25,879 --> 00:57:27,914
I THINK IT'S PRETTY CLEAR THAT I

1515

DON'T YOU DARE SING THAT DAMN

1519
00:57:27,914 --> 00:57:32,452
JINGLE TO ME, NO.

1520
00:57:32,452 --> 00:57:38,692
THIS MAN SUCKED UP A WASP NEST

1521
00:57:32,452 --> 00:57:38,692
WITH A VACUUM AND NOW HE WON'T

1522
00:57:32,452 --> 00:57:38,692
EVEN THROW IT AWAY.

1523
00:57:38,692 --> 00:57:42,829
>> LISTEN, DYSON --

1524
00:57:38,692 --> 00:57:42,829

1646
01:01:07,634 --> 01:01:13,406

1647
01:01:07,634 --> 01:01:13,406
SIR, I'M SORRY.

1648
01:01:07,634 --> 01:01:13,406
WE'LL BE TWO MINUTES.

1649
01:01:13,406 --> 01:01:16,543
>> OH, MY GOSH.

1650
01:01:13,406 --> 01:01:16,543
YOU'RE NOT FINISHED.

1651
01:01:13,406 --> 01:01:16,543
EXCUSE ME.

1652
01:01:16,543 --> 01:01:19,846
>> WELL, ACTUALLY, SIR -- I

1653
01:01:16,543 --> 01:01:19,846
DON'T THINK WE'VE EVER ACTUALLY

1654
01:01:16,543 --> 01:01:19,846
SPOKEN.

1655
01:01:19,846 --> 01:01:23,650
BUT I FEEL LIKE I ALWAYS SEE YOU

1656
01:01:19,846 --> 01:01:23,650
WITH A DIFFERENT BOOK.

1657
01:01:19,846 --> 01:01:23,650
YOU LIKE READING?

1658
01:01:23,650 --> 01:01:27,220
>> OH, YEAH.

1659
01:01:23,650 --> 01:01:27,220
YES, MA'AM.

1660
01:01:23,650 --> 01:01:27,220
IT'S HOW I'VE SEEN THE WORLD TEN

1661
01:01:27,220 --> 01:01:32,525
TIMES OVER, BECAUSE OF MY BOOKS.

1662
01:01:27,220 --> 01:01:32,525
>> I LOVE THAT.

1663
01:01:27,220 --> 01:01:32,525
YOU EVER TRY ANY WRITING?

1664
01:01:32,525 --> 01:01:36,963
>> I MEAN, I DABBLE.

1665
01:01:32,525 --> 01:01:36,963
BUT NO, MAYBE ONE DAY.

1666
01:01:32,525 --> 01:01:36,963
YOU ALL ARE THE WRITERS.

1667
01:01:36,963 --> 01:01:42,602
>> WELL, WHY DON'T YOU READ US

1668
01:01:36,963 --> 01:01:42,602
SOMETHING?

1669
01:01:36,963 --> 01:01:42,602
WHATEVER YOU GOT.

1670
01:01:42,602 --> 01:01:46,706
>> OH, I DON'T KNOW.

1671
01:01:42,602 --> 01:01:46,706
>> HEY, HEY.

1672
01:01:42,602 --> 01:01:46,706
NO JUDGMENTS HERE.

1673
01:01:46,706 --> 01:01:51,211
WE'RE ALL JUST TRYING STUFF OUT.

1674
01:01:46,706 --> 01:01:51,211
PROMISE.

1675
01:01:46,706 --> 01:01:51,211
>> COME ON, MAN, TAKE A SEAT.

1676
01:01:51,211 --> 01:01:54,814
>> YEAH, I'D LOVE TO HEAR IT,

1677
01:01:51,211 --> 01:01:54,814
PAL.

1678
01:01:51,211 --> 01:01:54,814
>> ABSOLUTELY.

1679
01:01:54,814 --> 01:02:00,320
>> GOSH, THAT'S SO NICE.

1680
01:01:54,814 --> 01:02:00,320
I'VE NEVER READ IN FRONT OF

1681
01:01:54,814 --> 01:02:00,320
PEOPLE BEFORE.

1682
01:02:00,320 --> 01:02:03,723
THIS ONE'S CALLED "THE APOGEE OF

1683
01:02:00,320 --> 01:02:03,723
MIDNIGHT."

1684
01:02:00,320 --> 01:02:03,723
>> OH, LOVELY.

1685
01:02:03,723 --> 01:02:08,728
PLEASE.

1686
01:02:03,723 --> 01:02:08,728
>> OKAY.

1687
01:02:03,723 --> 01:02:08,728
THERE IT WAS AGAIN.

1688
01:02:08,728 --> 01:02:12,365
THE SOUND OF MOP ON TILE.

1689
01:02:08,728 --> 01:02:12,365
THE START OF ANOTHER LATE NIGHT.

1690
01:02:08,728 --> 01:02:12,365
ONE OF THOUSANDS LIKE IT.

1691
01:02:12,365 --> 01:02:16,536
ALONE IN CHANDLER HIGH.

1692
01:02:12,365 --> 01:02:16,536
BUT THE JANITOR LIKED THE

1693
01:02:12,365 --> 01:02:16,536
SILENCE.

1694
01:02:16,536 --> 01:02:21,107
IT HELD HIM IN A COOL, DELICATE

1695
01:02:16,536 --> 01:02:21,107
CALM.

1696
01:02:16,536 --> 01:02:21,107
>> HM, WOW, I REALLY LIKE THAT.

1697
01:02:21,107 --> 01:02:27,547
>> THANK YOU.

1698
01:02:21,107 --> 01:02:27,547
THEN, FOOTSTEPS.

1699
01:02:21,107 --> 01:02:27,547
LOUD AND GETTING CLOSER.

1700
01:02:27,547 --> 01:02:33,286
HELLO?

1701
01:02:27,547 --> 01:02:33,286
SCHOOL'S CLOSED.

1702
01:02:27,547 --> 01:02:33,286
A WOMAN TURNED THE CORNER.

1703
01:02:33,286 --> 01:02:37,290
SHE LOOKED LOST.

1704
01:02:33,286 --> 01:02:37,290
SORRY, I'M LOOKING FOR SOMEONE

1705
01:02:33,286 --> 01:02:37,290

OH, YEAH?

WHO'S ASKING?

1708
01:02:37,290 --> 01:02:43,763
MY NAME IS DUA LIPA.

1709
01:02:43,763 --> 01:02:47,901
I'M A BIG POP STAR AND I'M

1712
01:02:47,901 --> 01:02:55,308
>> OKAY.

1713
01:02:47,901 --> 01:02:55,308
>> THE JANITOR PAUSED.

1714
01:02:47,901 --> 01:02:55,308
THAT WAS HIS NAME.

1715
01:02:55,308 --> 01:03:00,513
DUA LIPA SIGHED.

1716
01:02:55,308 --> 01:03:00,513
YOU HAVEN'T HEARD OF ME, HAVE

1717
01:02:55,308 --> 01:03:00,513
YOU?

1718
01:03:00,513 --> 01:03:04,651
SORRY, MA'AM.

1719
01:03:00,513 --> 01:03:04,651
MORE OF A CLASSIC ROCK GUY

1720
01:03:00,513 --> 01:03:04,651
MYSELF.

1721
01:03:04,651 --> 01:03:08,555
BUT SURE, MAYBE I'VE SEEN A

1722
01:03:04,651 --> 01:03:08,555
BIKINI PIC OR TWO, HOW CAN I

1723
01:03:04,651 --> 01:03:08,555
HELP?

1724
01:03:08,555 --> 01:03:14,594
>> OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT, IT IS

1725
01:03:08,555 --> 01:03:14,594
GETTING PRETTY LATE.

1726
01:03:08,555 --> 01:03:14,594
SO I THINK WE SHOULD PROBABLY

1727
01:03:14,594 --> 01:03:16,196
WRAP IT UP.

1728
01:03:14,594 --> 01:03:16,196
>> WHAT?

1729
01:03:14,594 --> 01:03:16,196
HE JUST STARTED.

1730
01:03:16,196 --> 01:03:19,632
>> WRAP UP?

1731
01:03:16,196 --> 01:03:19,632
SO I CAN MOP?

1732
01:03:16,196 --> 01:03:19,632
HECK, I GOT TIME.

1733
01:03:19,632 --> 01:03:23,503
>> YEAH, AND I WANT TO KNOW

1734
01:03:19,632 --> 01:03:23,503
WHERE IT'S GOING.

1735
01:03:19,632 --> 01:03:23,503
>> I DON'T.

1736
01:03:23,503 --> 01:03:28,108
>> YEAH, I THINK I'M GOOD.

1737
01:03:23,503 --> 01:03:28,108
>> YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.

1738
01:03:23,503 --> 01:03:28,108
I'M BAD AT THIS.

1739
01:03:28,108 --> 01:03:32,612
>> NO, NO.

1740
01:03:28,108 --> 01:03:32,612
WE SUPPORT IT.

1741
01:03:28,108 --> 01:03:32,612
SO PLEASE, GO AHEAD.

1742
01:03:32,612 --> 01:03:37,550
>> OH, THANK YOU.

1743
01:03:32,612 --> 01:03:37,550
MIND IF I SIT DOWN?

1744
01:03:32,612 --> 01:03:37,550
DUA LIPA WAS EXHAUSTED.

1745
01:03:37,550 --> 01:03:42,088
SHE'D JUST DONE A CONCERT IN

1746
01:03:37,550 --> 01:03:42,088

SHE WAS COOL.

1751
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:51,297
SO WHAT BRINGS YOU OUT ALL THIS

1753
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:51,297
GIRLIE?

1754

OH, I DON'T KNOW, THIS IS GOING

1755
01:03:51,297 --> 01:03:59,105
TO SOUND CRAZY.

1756
01:03:51,297 --> 01:03:59,105
COME ON, DUA LIPA, YOU KNOW YOU

1757
01:03:59,105 --> 01:04:03,610

I'M YOUR FRIEND.

1759
01:03:59,105 --> 01:04:03,610
IT'S TRUE.

1760
01:04:03,610 --> 01:04:08,815
THEY WERE FAST FRIENDS.

1761
01:04:03,610 --> 01:04:08,815
AND NOTHING MORE.

1762
01:04:03,610 --> 01:04:08,815
RIGHT?

1763
01:04:08,815 --> 01:04:18,224
>> ARE YOU ASKING US?

1764
01:04:08,815 --> 01:04:18,224
>> PLEASE.

1765
01:04:08,815 --> 01:04:18,224
I'M STILL READING.

1766
01:04:18,224 --> 01:04:21,695
WELL, I GUESS I WANTED TO ASK

1767
01:04:18,224 --> 01:04:21,695

1770
01:04:21,695 --> 01:04:24,664
WOULD YOU TEACH ME HOW TO MAKE

1771
01:04:21,695 --> 01:04:24,664
OUT?

1772
01:04:24,664 --> 01:04:28,268
I'VE NEVER DONE IT BEFORE.

1773
01:04:24,664 --> 01:04:28,268
>> OKAY, I'M SORRY, I JUST --

1774
01:04:24,664 --> 01:04:28,268
NO.

1775
01:04:28,268 --> 01:04:35,075
>> OH, COME ON.

1776
01:04:28,268 --> 01:04:35,075
>> WHY?

1777
01:04:28,268 --> 01:04:35,075
>> LOOK, I THINK THAT IT'S GREAT

1778
01:04:35,075 --> 01:04:39,779
THAT YOU WRITE.

1779
01:04:35,075 --> 01:04:39,779
I JUST DON'T REALLY WANT TO

1780
01:04:35,075 --> 01:04:39,779
HEAR ABOUT YOUR WEIRD, MADE-UP

1781
01:04:39,779 --> 01:04:41,247

1782
01:04:39,779 --> 01:04:41,247
I'M SORRY, I DON'T.

1783
01:04:39,779 --> 01:04:41,247
>> MY THING?

1784
01:04:41,247 --> 01:04:44,317
THIS AIN'T ME, MAMA, THIS IS

1785
01:04:41,247 --> 01:04:44,317
FICTION.

1786
01:04:41,247 --> 01:04:44,317
THIRD PERSON.

1787
01:04:44,317 --> 01:04:50,890

1791
01:04:50,890 --> 01:04:56,529

1792
01:04:50,890 --> 01:04:56,529
WHY?

1793
01:04:56,529 --> 01:05:03,169
>> IT'S KIND OF CREEPY, MAN.

1794
01:04:56,529 --> 01:05:03,169
>> VERY CREEPY.

1795
01:04:56,529 --> 01:05:03,169
>> I SEE.

1796
01:05:03,169 --> 01:05:05,939
I GUESS I'M NOT A WRITER AFTER

1797
01:05:03,169 --> 01:05:05,939
ALL.

1798
01:05:03,169 --> 01:05:05,939
BACK TO THE TOILETS IT IS.

1799
01:05:05,939 --> 01:05:09,175

1800
01:05:05,939 --> 01:05:09,175

OKAY.

1802
01:05:09,175 --> 01:05:14,447
SURE, DUA LIPA, I CAN TEACH YOU

1803
01:05:09,175 --> 01:05:14,447
HOW TO MAKE OUT.

1804
01:05:09,175 --> 01:05:14,447
WAIT, CAN MY FRIEND COME?

1805
01:05:14,447 --> 01:05:23,189
HER NAME IS TAWNY McDANIELS.

1806
01:05:14,447 --> 01:05:23,189
THE FAMOUS GINGER MILF?

1807
01:05:14,447 --> 01:05:23,189
ONE AND THE SAME.

1808
