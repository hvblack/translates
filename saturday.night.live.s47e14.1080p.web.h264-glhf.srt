1
00:00:02,202 --> 00:00:04,922
>>> AND NOW, LIVE FROM MAR-A-LAGO,

2
00:00:04,983 --> 00:00:09,127
IT'S THE "FOX NEWS
UKRAINIAN INVASION CELEBRATION
SPECTACULAR!"

3
00:00:09,127 --> 00:00:13,517
WITH YOUR HOSTS, TUCKER CARLSON
AND LAURA INGRAHAM!

4
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:28,327
>> GOOD EVENING.
I'M TUCKER CARLSON.

5
00:00:28,327 --> 00:00:30,556
I'M LIKE A PAIR OF BOAT SHOES
CAME TO LIFE.

6
00:00:30,556 --> 00:00:32,144
>> AND I'M LAURA INGRAHAM.

7
00:00:32,144 --> 00:00:36,000
AND WHEN I WATCH "HARRY POTTER"
I ROOT FOR VOLDEMORT.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,763
>> WE GOT INTO A LITTLE BIT OF
TROUBLE FOR ALL THE NICE THINGS
WE SAID ABOUT RUSSIA

9
00:00:40,763 --> 00:00:42,738
AND THE
MEAN THING WE SAID ABOUT
UKRAINE.

10
00:00:42,738 --> 00:00:47,002
>> WE DID SOUND PRETTY AWFUL IN
HINDSIGHT.
AND FORESIGHT.

11
00:00:47,002 --> 00:00:49,780
>> I KEPT ASKING WHY DO WE HATE
PUTIN?

12
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:52,341
AREN'T LIBERALS IN AMERICA EVEN
WORSE?

13
00:00:52,341 --> 00:00:55,224
>> AND I CALLED THE PRESIDENT OF
UKRAINE PATHETIC.

14
00:00:55,224 --> 00:00:57,559
HE STAYED AND FOUGHT WITH HIS PEOPLE IN THE WAR

15
00:00:57,559 --> 00:01:00,972
AND I CALLED
HIM PATHETIC FROM A NEWS DESK IN
WASHINGTON.

16
00:01:00,972 --> 00:01:04,425
>> I KEPT SAYING WE SHOULD BE
MORE WORRIED

17
00:01:04,501 --> 00:01:07,174
ABOUT OUR OWN
BORDER GETTING INVADED BY
MEXICO.

18
00:01:07,174 --> 00:01:11,263
BUT IN MY DEFENSE, I AM RACIST.
SO I THOUGHT THAT WAS TRUE.

19
00:01:11,263 --> 00:01:14,378
>> BUT TONIGHT WE'RE GOING TO
MAKE IT UP.

20
00:01:14,378 --> 00:01:17,630
WE'RE RAISING MONEY FOR THE REAL
VICTIMS OF THIS INVASION.

21
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:19,382
THE OLIGARCHS.

22
00:01:19,382 --> 00:01:24,351
BECAUSE WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT
THE BABIES.
THEIR SUGAR BABIES.

23
00:01:24,351 --> 00:01:29,363
WHO WILL POUR VODKA IN THEIR
MOUTHS?
SO MANY HORNY MOUTHS TO FEED.

24
00:01:29,363 --> 00:01:33,139
>> SO PLEASE OPEN YOUR WALLETS
AND BECAUSE THIS IS FOX NEWS

25
00:01:33,139 --> 00:01:36,629
 YOU
CAN EITHER SEND MONEY OR TAKE
OUT A REVERSE MORTGAGE.

26
00:01:36,629 --> 00:01:41,089
SO FAR WE'VE RAISED OVER 8.3
BILLION RUBLES, 

27
00:01:41,089 --> 00:01:43,808
WHICH COMES OUT
TO ALMOST $12.

28
00:01:43,808 --> 00:01:46,211
>> AND THIS IS INCREDIBLY
EXCITING.

29
00:01:46,211 --> 00:01:50,291
FORMER AND CURRENT PRESIDENT OF
THE UNITED STATES DONALD TRUMP

30
00:01:50,291 --> 00:01:52,791
IS MANNING THE PHONE LINES
HIMSELF.

31
00:01:52,791 --> 00:01:57,305
>> AND THE THING IS ABOUT
RIHANNA, SHE CAN PULL IT OFF.

32
00:01:57,305 --> 00:02:01,441
SHE CAN BE NINE MONTHS.
THE BODY'S STILL INCREDIBLE.

33
00:02:01,441 --> 00:02:03,645
BUT NOW YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A
LOT OF WOMEN 

34
00:02:03,645 --> 00:02:07,234
SEEING THIS
RIGHT NOW, 3s, 4s, FRANKLY
TROLLS, 

35
00:02:07,234 --> 00:02:09,540
WEARING THE SAME
SEE-THROUGH SHIRT.

36
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:12,105
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
I HESITATE TO SAY WHALES BECAUSE
I KNOW THE WHALES,

37
00:02:12,105 --> 00:02:14,431
 I'M VERY
POPULAR WITH THE WHALES.
I DO GREAT WITH WHALES.

38
00:02:14,431 --> 00:02:18,111
THEY COME UP TO ME ON THE BEACH
AND THEY SAY THANK YOU, MR.
PRESIDENT.

39
00:02:18,111 --> 00:02:21,438
YOU KNOW, THE BLOWHOLES BLASTING
AWAY.
200, 300 FEET IN THE AIR.

40
00:02:21,438 --> 00:02:23,471
IT'S HOW THEY SALUTE ME.

41
00:02:23,471 --> 00:02:26,725
>> OKAY.
WE'LL COME BACK TO YOU, MR.
PRESIDENT, 

42
00:02:26,725 --> 00:02:30,034
BECAUSE OUR FIRST
GUEST IS HERE.
HE'S A GREAT AMERICAN PATRIOT.

43
00:02:30,034 --> 00:02:33,877
SO GREAT THAT HE LEFT AMERICA
AND BECAME A RUSSIAN CITIZEN.

44
00:02:33,877 --> 00:02:38,020
THE PUFFIEST ACTION STAR IN THE
WORLD, STEVEN SEAGAL.

45
00:02:38,647 --> 00:02:43,198
>> THANK YOU.
THANK YOU, TUCKER.

46
00:02:43,198 --> 00:02:46,636
OH, WHAT A GLOBAL CRISIS WE ARE
FACING.

47
00:02:46,636 --> 00:02:52,221
AS SOMEONE WHO PROUDLY PRETENDS
TO BE BOTH NATIVE AMERICAN AND JAPANESE,

48
00:02:52,221 --> 00:02:54,834
 I FEEL FOR ALL PEOPLE.

49
00:02:54,834 --> 00:02:57,440
>> NOW, YOU'RE CLOSE WITH
PRESIDENT PUTIN, RIGHT?

50
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:01,240
>> YES.
PUTIN AND I ARE, AS THEY SAY IN ANCIENT JAPAN,

51
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:03,587
 ESKIMO BROTHERS.

52
00:03:03,587 --> 00:03:05,863
SO I WILL BE HONORING PUTIN 

53
00:03:05,863 --> 00:03:10,638
BY PERFORMING AN AUTHENTIC
TAEKWONDO EXHIBITION.

54
00:03:14,311 --> 00:03:16,924
NOW IT'S TIME TO HONOR MYSELF

55
00:03:16,924 --> 00:03:20,970
WITH A TRADITIONAL JAPANESE
SHAMROCK SHAKE.

56
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:26,478
THE TRADITIONAL SEASONAL
BEVERAGE OF ALL AIKIDO
EXHIBITIONS.

57
00:03:27,564 --> 00:03:30,314
THANK

58
00:03:31,466 --> 00:03:37,623
>> LET'S CHECK BACK IN WITH THE
MAN WHO SAID PUTIN'S INVASION
WAS VERY SMART

59
00:03:37,623 --> 00:03:41,742
 AND ALSO SAID
CHINA SHOULD INVADE TAIWAN NEXT.
MR. PRESIDENT?

60
00:03:41,742 --> 00:03:45,906
>> MY FAVORITE FOOD IS PROBABLY
BREAD.
YOU KNOW?

61
00:03:45,906 --> 00:03:49,305
AND MORE SPECIFICALLY BUN.
I LIKE BUN.

62
00:03:49,305 --> 00:03:52,141
BUN IS GREAT.
ESPECIALLY WITH RESPECT TO
BURGER.

63
00:03:52,141 --> 00:03:55,210
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
BEYOND BURGER.
CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT?

64
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:57,175
I WANT TO STAY RIGHT AT BURGER.

65
00:03:57,175 --> 00:03:59,261
BEYOND IS NOT GOOD.

66
00:03:59,261 --> 00:04:03,600
JOE BIDEN HAS GONE BEYOND BURGER
AND IT HAS NOT GONE SO WELL.

67

PRINCE.

68
00:04:06,199 --> 00:04:10,828
IT'S VERY DIFFERENT AND I'M
LAUGHING AND I'M LAUGHING BUT I
DON'T KNOW WHY.

69
00:04:10,828 --> 00:04:14,746

THEM, "YOU CAN PICK TWO OF THESE

149
00:10:58,625 --> 00:11:03,797
NAMES."

150
00:11:03,797 --> 00:11:07,701
GUESS WHAT THEY WENT WITH.

151
00:11:03,797 --> 00:11:07,701
THE WHITE ONES.

152
00:11:07,701 --> 00:11:13,373
I'M HALF GUATEMALAN, HALF CUBAN.

153
00:11:07,701 --> 00:11:13,373
OR AS CASTING DIRECTORS CALL

154
00:11:13,373 --> 00:11:17,844
THAT, "ETHNICALLY AMBIGUOUS."

155
00:11:13,373 --> 00:11:17,844
ACCORDING TO THEM, I CAN PLAY

156
00:11:17,844 --> 00:11:23,083
ANYTHING FROM A PHARAOH TO

157
00:11:17,844 --> 00:11:23,083
TIMOTHEE CHALAMET'S DADDY.

158
00:11:17,844 --> 00:11:23,083
YOU KNOW THAT JOKE, A PRIEST, A

159
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:26,186
RABBI, AND A MINISTER WALK INTO

160
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:26,186
A BAR?

161
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:26,186
YEAH, I COULD PLAY ANYONE IN

162
00:11:26,186 --> 00:11:29,389
THAT JOKE.

163
00:11:26,186 --> 00:11:29,389
BUT I AM EXCITED.

164
00:11:29,389 --> 00:11:36,629
I'M JOINING THE MARVEL UNIVERSE

165
00:11:29,389 --> 00:11:36,629
WITH "MOON KNIGHT."

166
00:11:36,629 --> 00:11:39,966
YOU KNOW, IT'S KIND OF A FULL

167
00:11:36,629 --> 00:11:39,966
CIRCLE MOMENT SINCE THE FIRST

168
00:11:36,629 --> 00:11:39,966
MOVIE I WAS EVER IN WAS CALLED

169
00:11:39,966 --> 00:11:45,638
THE AVENGER.

170
00:11:39,966 --> 00:11:45,638
NOT "THE AVENGERS," WHICH WAS A

171
00:11:39,966 --> 00:11:45,638
MASSIVE BLOCKBUSTER.

172
00:11:45,638 --> 00:11:48,808
NO, THIS WAS "THE AVENGER,"

173
00:11:45,638 --> 00:11:48,808
WHICH IS A MOVIE THAT I WROTE,

174
00:11:45,638 --> 00:11:48,808
DIRECTED, AND STARRED IN WHEN I

175
00:11:48,808 --> 00:11:54,381
WAS 10 YEARS OLD.

176
00:11:48,808 --> 00:11:54,381
IT WAS SHOT ON LOCATION IN MY

177
00:11:48,808 --> 00:11:54,381
BUDDY BRUCE FERGUSON'S BACK YARD

178
00:11:54,381 --> 00:11:57,584
IN OUR HOMETOWN OF MIAMI,

179
00:11:54,381 --> 00:11:57,584
FLORIDA.

180
00:11:54,381 --> 00:11:57,584
I PLAY A NINJA ASSASSIN TRAINING

181
00:11:57,584 --> 00:12:03,390
TO FIGHT HIS NEMESIS.

182
00:11:57,584 --> 00:12:03,390
AND WE ACTUALLY HAVE A CLIP.

183
00:11:57,584 --> 00:12:03,390
THIS IS REAL, CHECK THIS OUT.

184
00:12:04,758 --> 00:12:10,063
>>  OKAY, THERE'S THE OPENING

185
00:12:04,758 --> 00:12:10,063
TITLE.

186
00:12:04,758 --> 00:12:10,063
AND THERE I AM.

187
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:12,499
KIND OF LOSING MY BALANCE A

188
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:12,499
LITTLE BIT.

189
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:12,499
PERFECT EDITING.

190
00:12:12,499 --> 00:12:16,970
AND HERE COMES MY BIG STUNT.

191
00:12:12,499 --> 00:12:16,970
I TRAINED TWO MONTHS FOR THIS.

192
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:24,444
YAH!

193
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:24,444
I MEAN, ARGUABLY BETTER THAN THE

194
00:12:24,444 --> 00:12:28,915
REAL "AVENGERS."

195
00:12:24,444 --> 00:12:28,915
AND I MADE IT FOR HALF THE

196
00:12:24,444 --> 00:12:28,915
BUDGET, ONLY $110 MILLION.

197
00:12:28,915 --> 00:12:31,384
BUT I TOOK IT REALLY SERIOUSLY.

198
00:12:28,915 --> 00:12:31,384
MAYBE A LITTLE TOO SERIOUSLY.

199
00:12:31,384 --> 00:12:37,757
LIKE IN THIS SCENE.

200
00:12:31,384 --> 00:12:37,757
OKAY, THERE I AM ACTING MY HEART

201
00:12:31,384 --> 00:12:37,757
OUT.

202
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:41,995
AND THERE'S MY FRIEND'S DAD

203
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:41,995
CLEANING THE POOL.

204
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:41,995
SHOUT-OUT TO MR. FERGUSON, AND

205
00:12:41,995 --> 00:12:47,534
SHOUT-OUT TO MY BUDDY, BRUCE.

206
00:12:41,995 --> 00:12:47,534
HE'S AT HOME WATCHING AND HE HAD

207
00:12:41,995 --> 00:12:47,534
NO IDEA OUR OLD MOVIE WAS GOING

208
00:12:47,534 --> 00:12:50,303
TO BE ON "SNL."

209
00:12:47,534 --> 00:12:50,303
I ACTUALLY HAD TO SIGN A

210
00:12:47,534 --> 00:12:50,303
LICENSING AGREEMENT TO SHOW IT.

211
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:55,775
THAT'S TRUE.

212
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:55,775
NBC UNIVERSAL NOW OWNS "THE

213
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:55,775
AVENGER."

214
00:12:55,775 --> 00:13:03,750
COMING THIS FALL TO PEACOCK!

215
00:12:55,775 --> 00:13:03,750
I'VE GOT ONE MORE CLIP.

216
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:09,055
THIS IS A SCENE I DID WITH

217
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:09,055
MYSELF WHERE I PLAY BOTH PARTS.

218
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:09,055
OKAY?

219
00:13:09,055 --> 00:13:18,098
HERE WE GO.

220
00:13:09,055 --> 00:13:18,098
THAT'S ME.

221
00:13:09,055 --> 00:13:18,098
I'M MY OWN HENCHMAN.

222
00:13:18,098 --> 00:13:24,804
UH-OH.

223
00:13:18,098 --> 00:13:24,804
NOW WATCH WHAT I DO WITH THE

224
00:13:18,098 --> 00:13:24,804
SWORD.

225
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:28,141
TOTAL COMMITMENT FROM THE START.

226
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:28,141
NOW, YOU MIGHT BE ASKING, OSCAR,

227
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:31,745
WHY DID YOU USE YOUR MONOLOGUE

228
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:31,745
TO SHOW US THESE OLD HOME

229
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:31,745
VIDEOS?

230
00:13:31,745 --> 00:13:41,087
AND THE REASON IS IT'S IMPORTANT

231
00:13:31,745 --> 00:13:41,087
TO ENCOURAGE KIDS TO BE WEIRDOS.

232
00:13:41,087 --> 00:13:48,895
BECAUSE EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE

233
00:13:41,087 --> 00:13:48,895
ONE OF THOSE WEIRDOS GROWS UP TO

234
00:13:41,087 --> 00:13:48,895
HOST "SNL."

235
00:13:48,895 --> 00:13:51,431
WE'VE GOT A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU

236
00:13:48,895 --> 00:13:51,431
TONIGHT.

237
00:13:51,431 --> 00:13:53,500
CHARLI XCX IS HERE.

238
00:13:51,431 --> 00:13:53,500
SO STICK AROUND.

239
00:13:51,431 --> 00:13:53,500
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

240
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,101
SO STICK AROUND.

241
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,101
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

242
00:14:05,045 --> 00:14:10,050
HEREBY PRESENT THE PAW PATROL

243
00:14:05,045 --> 00:14:10,050
WITH THIS MEDAL OF BRAVERY FOR

244
00:14:05,045 --> 00:14:10,050
STOPPING THAT OUT-OF-CONTROL HOT

245
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:15,855
AIR BALLOON.

246
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:15,855
WITH YOU PUPS ON PATROL, OUR

247
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:15,855
CITY IS IN GOOD HANDS.

248
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:23,363
>> DON'T YOU MEAN GOOD PAWS?

249
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:23,363
>> HA HA HA!

250
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:23,363
>> ENOUGH IS ENOUGH.

251
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:27,801
I'M CITY COUNCILMAN

252
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:27,801
HERB TANGIER.

253
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:27,801
MAYOR GOODWAY HAS PUT ALL OUR

254
00:14:27,801 --> 00:14:32,472
LIVES AT RISK WITH HER PAW

255
00:14:27,801 --> 00:14:32,472
PATROL INITIATIVE AND I SAY IT'S

256
00:14:27,801 --> 00:14:32,472
TIME TO VOTE HER OUT.

257
00:14:32,472 --> 00:14:37,744
FACT!

258
00:14:32,472 --> 00:14:37,744
THIS MAN FIRED ALL OF OUR CITY'S

259
00:14:32,472 --> 00:14:37,744
POLICE OFFICERS, FIREFIGHTERS,

260
00:14:37,744 --> 00:14:41,414
AND PARAMEDICS, AND REPLACED

261
00:14:37,744 --> 00:14:41,414
THEM WITH A GROUP OF SIX TALKING

262
00:14:37,744 --> 00:14:41,414
DOGS.

263
00:14:41,414 --> 00:14:43,883
I THINK THAT WAS A BAD IDEA.

264
00:14:41,414 --> 00:14:43,883
AND I'M NOT ALONE.

265
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:50,256
LISTEN TO THESE CONCERNED

266
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:50,256
CITIZENS.

267
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:50,256
>> I WAS EXCITED ABOUT THE PAW

268
00:14:50,256 --> 00:14:54,227
PATROL AT FIRST.

269
00:14:50,256 --> 00:14:54,227
TALKING DOGS WHO KNOW HOW TO FLY

270
00:14:50,256 --> 00:14:54,227
JETS AND DRIVE?

271
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:59,866
GREAT.

272
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:59,866
BUT IT'S BECOME CLEAR THAT SIX

273
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:59,866
DOGS CANNOT PROTECT A CITY

274
00:14:59,866 --> 00:15:05,905
ROUGHLY THE SIZE OF SAN DIEGO.

275
00:14:59,866 --> 00:15:05,905
>> CRIMINALS AND LOW-LIFES ARE

276
00:14:59,866 --> 00:15:05,905
FLOCKING HERE BECAUSE THEY KNOW

277
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:12,212
THERE'S ONLY ONE COP PATROLLING

278
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:12,212
OUR STREETS AND IT'S A DOG!

279
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:12,212
>> AND THERE'S ONLY ONE

280
00:15:12,212 --> 00:15:17,951
FIREFIGHTER, ALSO A DOG.

281
00:15:12,212 --> 00:15:17,951
SO IF THERE'S TWO FIRES AT THE

282
00:15:12,212 --> 00:15:17,951
SAME TIME?

283
00:15:17,951 --> 00:15:24,524
SOMEONE'S GETTING SCREWED, I

284
00:15:17,951 --> 00:15:24,524
GUESS?

285
00:15:17,951 --> 00:15:24,524
WHO IS IN CHARGE OF THIS

286
00:15:24,524 --> 00:15:28,762
ORGANIZATION?

287
00:15:24,524 --> 00:15:28,762
A CHILD?

288
00:15:24,524 --> 00:15:28,762
>> YES!

289
00:15:28,762 --> 00:15:31,698
THE PAW PATROL IS RUN BY A

290
00:15:28,762 --> 00:15:31,698
10-YEAR-OLD BOY NAMED RYDER.

291
00:15:28,762 --> 00:15:31,698
WHO IS THIS KID?

292
00:15:31,698 --> 00:15:36,302
BEATS ME!

293
00:15:31,698 --> 00:15:36,302
AS FAR AS WE CAN TELL, HE HAS NO

294
00:15:31,698 --> 00:15:36,302
PARENTS AND DOESN'T GO TO

295
00:15:36,302 --> 00:15:42,442
SCHOOL.

296
00:15:36,302 --> 00:15:42,442
BUT MAYBE THAT'S FOR THE BEST,

297
00:15:36,302 --> 00:15:42,442
BECAUSE WITH ALL OUR TAX DOLLARS

298
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:46,579
PAYING FOR A LITTLE COCKAPOO'S

299
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:46,579
JET PACK, WE NOW HAVE THE WORST

300
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:46,579
SCHOOLS IN THE STATE.

301
00:15:46,579 --> 00:15:52,352
THIS IS MY 17-YEAR-OLD SON.

302
00:15:46,579 --> 00:15:52,352
HE CAN BARELY READ.

303
00:15:46,579 --> 00:15:52,352
>> I CAN READ, I JUST DON'T KNOW

304
00:15:52,352 --> 00:15:56,389
WHAT SOUND VOWELS MAKE WHEN

305
00:15:52,352 --> 00:15:56,389
THEY'RE NEXT TO OTHER LETTERS IN

306
00:15:52,352 --> 00:15:56,389
A LINE.

307
00:15:56,389 --> 00:16:00,660
>> MAYOR GOODWAY, THIS IS ALL

308
00:15:56,389 --> 00:16:00,660
YOUR FAULT AND YOU NEED TO GO!

309
00:15:56,389 --> 00:16:00,660
>> FACT.

310
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:04,464
OUR CITY'S COVID RESPONSE WAS A

311
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:04,464
NATIONAL DISGRACE.

312
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:04,464
WHY?

313
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:09,269
BECAUSE SIX DOGS WERE IN CHARGE

314
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:09,269
OF IT.

315
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:09,269
>> FACT.

316
00:16:09,269 --> 00:16:16,810
CHASE THE POLICE DOG'S ONLY

317
00:16:09,269 --> 00:16:16,810
WEAPON IS A NET.

318
00:16:09,269 --> 00:16:16,810

>> FACT, MARSHALL THE FIRE DOG

324
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:30,256
IS MY FAVORITE ONE.

325
00:16:30,256 --> 00:16:35,428
HE'S THE FUNNIEST PUP BY FAR AND

326
00:16:30,256 --> 00:16:35,428
THE COOLEST BY A MILE.

327
00:16:30,256 --> 00:16:35,428
BUT I DON'T THINK HE COULD CARRY

328
00:16:35,428 --> 00:16:42,702
ME DOWN A FLIGHT OF STAIRS

329
00:16:35,428 --> 00:16:42,702
BECAUSE HE AIN'T GOT NO HANDS.

MIDDLE SCHOOL IN THE '90s I WAS

SOME -- I WAS KIND OF LIKE

1054
00:39:18,625 --> 00:39:22,362
TORTURED BY THE CONSTANT USE OF

1055

THE WORD "GAY."

1056
00:39:18,625 --> 00:39:22,362
"THAT'S SO GAY.

1057
00:39:22,362 --> 00:39:28,635
EW, YOU'RE GAY."

1058

1061

00:39:28,635 --> 00:39:34,407
ANYMORE.

1063

CAN'T ACKNOWLEDGE THAT GAY

1071

1088
00:40:16,316 --> 00:40:19,919
>> YEAH.

1089
00:40:19,919 --> 00:40:21,488

BUT THE SHOW SAID THAT IF I

1328
00:47:44,464 --> 00:47:50,070
PLAYED 150 OF THEM, THEN AS A

1329
00:47:50,070 --> 00:47:56,176
REWARD I COULD WRITE A SKETCH OF

1330
00:47:50,070 --> 00:47:56,176
MY OWN CHOOSING.

1331

1332
00:47:56,176 --> 00:48:00,513
SIDE OF MYSELF.

1333
00:47:56,176 --> 00:48:00,513
SO TONIGHT, THIS IS THAT SKETCH.

1334
00:47:56,176 --> 00:48:00,513
ENJOY.

1335
00:48:00,513 --> 00:48:06,886
>> I'M SO NERVOUS, I CAN'T

1336
00:48:00,513 --> 00:48:06,886
BELIEVE SIEGFRIED'S GOING TO

1337
00:48:06,886 --> 00:48:11,491
TAKE ME, A LOSER AND A FOOL.

1338
00:48:06,886 --> 00:48:11,491
HOW DO I LOOK?

1339
00:48:06,886 --> 00:48:11,491
>> YOU LOOK FANTASTIC, SIR.

1340
00:48:11,491 --> 00:48:16,029
I'M SURE SHE'LL BE TITILLATED.

1341
00:48:11,491 --> 00:48:16,029
>> BUT YOU'RE RIGHT TO BE

1342
00:48:11,491 --> 00:48:16,029
SCARED.

1343
00:48:16,029 --> 00:48:23,636
SHE IS THE MOST WIDELY DESIRED

1344
00:48:16,029 --> 00:48:23,636
WOMAN IN THE WORLD.

1345
00:48:16,029 --> 00:48:23,636
>> OH, I'M SICK.

1346
00:48:23,636 --> 00:48:26,639
I'M SICK WITH FEELING FOR THIS

1347
00:48:23,636 --> 00:48:26,639
WOMAN.

1348
00:48:26,639 --> 00:48:31,211
IT'S HER.

1349
00:48:26,639 --> 00:48:31,211
PRAY FOR ME BOYS.

1350
00:48:26,639 --> 00:48:31,211
**

1351
00:48:31,211 --> 00:48:33,780
>> HELLO.

1352
00:48:31,211 --> 00:48:33,780
NOW, SCRAM, BOYS, AND LEAVE THIS

1353
00:48:33,780 --> 00:48:38,284
MAN TO ME.

1354
00:48:33,780 --> 00:48:38,284
>> MY GOD.

1355
00:48:33,780 --> 00:48:38,284
YOU ARE SO BEAUTIFUL.

1356
00:48:38,284 --> 00:48:45,825
AND SEXUAL.

1357
00:48:38,284 --> 00:48:45,825
AND I CAN TELL YOUR

1358
00:48:38,284 --> 00:48:45,825
PERSONALITY'S ALSO REALLY GOOD.

1359
00:48:45,825 --> 00:48:50,063
>> OH GOD, IF I HAD A NICKEL FOR

1360
00:48:45,825 --> 00:48:50,063
EVERY TIME I HEARD A MAN SAY

1361
00:48:45,825 --> 00:48:50,063
THAT, I WOULD HAVE SO MANY COINS

1362
00:48:50,063 --> 00:48:56,603
THAT IT WOULD BE ANNOYING.

1363
00:48:50,063 --> 00:48:56,603
>> OH, SENSUAL WOMAN.

1364
00:48:50,063 --> 00:48:56,603
YOU MAKE ME SO HORNY.

1365
00:48:56,603 --> 00:49:03,109
I SEE WHY THEY CALL YOU THE

1366
00:48:56,603 --> 00:49:03,109
SEXUAL WOMAN.

1367
00:48:56,603 --> 00:49:03,109
>> SO YEAH, I LIED TO

1368
00:49:03,109 --> 00:49:07,647
OSCAR ISAAC.

1369
00:49:03,109 --> 00:49:07,647
I TOLD HIM I HAVE A FAMOUS

1370
00:49:03,109 --> 00:49:07,647
RECURRING CHARACTER ON THE SHOW

1371
00:49:07,647 --> 00:49:15,488
CALLED "THE SEXUAL WOMAN."

1372
00:49:07,647 --> 00:49:15,488
IS THAT A CRIME?

1373
00:49:07,647 --> 00:49:15,488
**

1374
00:49:15,488 --> 00:49:23,329
>> OH, I'M THE LUCKIEST MAN ON

1375
00:49:15,488 --> 00:49:23,329
EARTH TO BE BRUSHING YOUR HAIR.

1376
00:49:15,488 --> 00:49:23,329
MIND IF I GET A LITTLE CLOSER?

1377
00:49:23,329 --> 00:49:31,838
>> OH, SURE.

1378
00:49:23,329 --> 00:49:31,838
BRING YOUR HEAD AND BODY THAT

1379
00:49:23,329 --> 00:49:31,838
LOOK LIKE THAT CLOSER TO ME,

1380
00:49:31,838 --> 00:49:33,640
WHATEVER.

1381
00:49:31,838 --> 00:49:33,640
I DON'T CARE.

1382
00:49:31,838 --> 00:49:33,640
>> I NEED YOU TO KNOW, I SEE YOU

1383
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:37,911
SEXUALLY.

1384
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:37,911
I DON'T SEE YOU AS SOMEONE WHO

1385
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:37,911
WOULD, LIKE, RUN A SCHOOL.

1386
00:49:37,911 --> 00:49:45,185
I MEAN, YOU ARE THE MOST UNDER

1387
00:49:37,911 --> 00:49:45,185
35 PERSON I'VE EVER MET.

1388
00:49:37,911 --> 00:49:45,185
>> OH, STOP IT, YOU FLIRT.

1389
00:49:45,185 --> 00:49:49,689
>> WELL, I BET YOU WERE ABOUT TO

1390
00:49:45,185 --> 00:49:49,689
DO YOUR BIG CATCHPHRASE.

1391
00:49:45,185 --> 00:49:49,689
>> UH -- OH, RIGHT.

1392
00:49:49,689 --> 00:49:57,364
YES.

1393
00:49:49,689 --> 00:49:57,364
MY FAMOUS CATCHPHRASE.

1394
00:49:49,689 --> 00:49:57,364
OF COURSE.

1395
00:49:57,364 --> 00:50:02,168
WHAT WAS IT?

1396
00:49:57,364 --> 00:50:02,168
HERE WE GO.

1397
00:49:57,364 --> 00:50:02,168
HEY, GET YOUR FAT ASS ON MY LAP,

1398
00:50:02,168 --> 00:50:06,339
BITCH!

1399
00:50:02,168 --> 00:50:06,339
>> OKAY.

1400
00:50:02,168 --> 00:50:06,339
YES.

1401
00:50:06,339 --> 00:50:16,249
>> OOH.

1402
00:50:06,339 --> 00:50:16,249
>> I MUST CONFESS, I HAVE A BIG

1403
00:50:06,339 --> 00:50:16,249
I MUST CONFESS, I HAVE A BIG,

1404
00:50:16,249 --> 00:50:22,922
COOL BONER RIGHT NOW WHICH I

1405
00:50:16,249 --> 00:50:22,922
SOMETIMES GET WHEN I RESPECT

1406
00:50:16,249 --> 00:50:22,922
SOMEONE TOO MUCH.

1407
00:50:22,922 --> 00:50:25,525
>> NOW, WHY DID I CHOOSE

1408
00:50:22,922 --> 00:50:25,525
OSCAR ISAAC FOR THE SKETCH?

1409
00:50:22,922 --> 00:50:25,525
NO REASON.

1410
00:50:25,525 --> 00:50:29,129
I MEAN, PRETTY RANDOM.

1411
00:50:25,525 --> 00:50:29,129
EVERY TIME I'VE DONE SOMETHING

1412
00:50:25,525 --> 00:50:29,129
ROMANTIC ON THE SHOW, IT'S BEEN

1413
00:50:29,129 --> 00:50:34,000
TOTALLY RANDOM.

1414
00:50:29,129 --> 00:50:34,000
LIKE WITH RYAN GOSLING.

1415
00:50:29,129 --> 00:50:34,000
OR DRAKE.

1416
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:40,140
OH, MY GOD.

1417
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:40,140
DO I HAVE A PATTERN OF SEXUAL

1418
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:40,140
RANDOMNESS?

1419
00:50:40,140 --> 00:50:48,148
WELL, WHATEVER.

1420
00:50:40,140 --> 00:50:48,148
YOU ONLY LIVE ONCE.

1421
00:50:40,140 --> 00:50:48,148
NOW BACK TO THE SKETCH.

1422
00:50:48,148 --> 00:50:54,454
>> IS THE FOOD ALL RIGHT?

1423
00:50:48,148 --> 00:50:54,454
I HOPE YOU EVEN LIKE SPAGHETTI.

1424
00:50:48,148 --> 00:50:54,454
>> YOU'RE LUCKY THAT I DO.

1425
00:50:54,454 --> 00:50:58,358
>> DAMN IT, I'M IN LOVE WITH YOU

1426
00:50:54,454 --> 00:50:58,358
AND IT'S KILLING ME!

1427
00:50:54,454 --> 00:50:58,358
>> OH!

1428
00:50:58,358 --> 00:51:02,228
YES.

1429
00:50:58,358 --> 00:51:02,228
TO ME THIS IS NORMAL BEHAVIOR.

1430
00:50:58,358 --> 00:51:02,228
>> I WROTE A SONG FOR YOU, IF

1431
00:51:02,228 --> 00:51:10,937
THAT'S OKAY.

1432
00:51:02,228 --> 00:51:10,937
**

1433
00:51:02,228 --> 00:51:10,937
* SEXUAL WOMAN ARE YOU FROM

1434
00:51:10,937 --> 00:51:15,342
PARIS OR BARCELONA *

1435
00:51:10,937 --> 00:51:15,342
* NO I'M FROM ARIZONA *

1436
00:51:10,937 --> 00:51:15,342
* SEXUAL WOMAN I RESPECT YOU

1437
00:51:15,342 --> 00:51:24,818
SO MUCH I'VE JUST

1438
00:51:15,342 --> 00:51:24,818
DEMONSTRATED BY MY INSANE

1439
00:51:15,342 --> 00:51:24,818
BONER *

1440
00:51:24,818 --> 00:51:28,955
>> OH.

1441
00:51:24,818 --> 00:51:28,955
A BONER?

1442
00:51:24,818 --> 00:51:28,955
LET ME GUESS.

1443
00:51:28,955 --> 00:51:32,592
YOU WANT TO KISS ME NOW.

1444
00:51:28,955 --> 00:51:32,592
>> YES, I DO.

1445
00:51:28,955 --> 00:51:32,592
BUT NOT YET.

1446
00:51:32,592 --> 00:51:40,500
YOU NEED TIME TO DIGEST ALL THAT

1447
00:51:32,592 --> 00:51:40,500
SPAGHETTI.

1448
00:51:32,592 --> 00:51:40,500
SO NOW COULD WE JUST HUG?

1449
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:43,103
>> YES, GOOD IDEA.

1450
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:43,103
I WOULD HAVE FORGOTTEN TO DIGEST

1451
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:43,103
AND REGRETTED IT LATER.

1452
00:51:43,103 --> 00:51:49,976
>> OH, WHAT THEY SAY ABOUT YOU

1453
00:51:43,103 --> 00:51:49,976
IS TRUE.

1454
00:51:43,103 --> 00:51:49,976
YOU ARE EVERYONE'S CUP OF TEA.

1455
00:51:49,976 --> 00:51:54,881
INCLUDING ME, OSCAR ISAAC.

1456
00:51:49,976 --> 00:51:54,881
>> OH, I KNOW, OSCAR ISAAC.

1457
00:51:49,976 --> 00:51:54,881
>> SORRY.

1458
00:51:54,881 --> 00:51:58,651
IS THAT -- IT SAYS MY REAL NAME

1459
00:51:54,881 --> 00:51:58,651
ON THE CARD.

1460
00:51:54,881 --> 00:51:58,651
IS THAT A MISTAKE?

1461
00:51:58,651 --> 00:52:03,523
>> I DON'T KNOW.

1462
00:51:58,651 --> 00:52:03,523
I GUESS -- THE WRITERS ARE SO

1463
00:51:58,651 --> 00:52:03,523
ANNOYING AND STUPID.

1464
00:52:03,523 --> 00:52:05,525
I WOULD SAY I GUESS JUSTIFY GO

1465
00:52:03,523 --> 00:52:05,525
WITH IT?

1466
00:52:03,523 --> 00:52:05,525
>> OKAY.

1467
00:52:05,525 --> 00:52:13,133
ALL RIGHT.

1468
00:52:05,525 --> 00:52:13,133
THEN LET'S GET MY FAT ASS ON

1469
00:52:05,525 --> 00:52:13,133
YOUR LAP.

1470
00:52:13,133 --> 00:52:16,236
YOUR LAP.

1471
00:52:13,133 --> 00:52:16,236
>> YES.

1472
00:52:13,133 --> 00:52:16,236
**

1473
00:52:29,315 --> 00:52:31,584
* YOU THOUGHT YOU

1474
00:52:29,315 --> 00:52:31,584
COULD FIX IT

1475
00:52:29,315 --> 00:52:31,584
BY YOURSELF *

1476
00:52:31,584 --> 00:52:34,554
* PLUMBING'S JUST AS EASY

1477
00:52:31,584 --> 00:52:34,554
AS BUILDING A SHELF *

1478
00:52:31,584 --> 00:52:34,554
* YOUR DIY BECOMES OMG

1479

YOU'RE IN OVER YOUR HEAD *

1480
00:52:34,554 --> 00:52:42,562
>>> WELL, HELLO.

AND WELCOME TO "IN OVER YOUR

1483
00:52:42,562 --> 00:52:49,235
HEAD" WHERE WE TALK TO FOLKS WHO

1484
00:52:42,562 --> 00:52:49,235
GOT A LITTLE OVERCONFIDENT

1485
00:52:49,235 --> 00:52:52,672
TAKING ON PROJECTS AROUND THE

1486
00:52:49,235 --> 00:52:52,672
HOUSE.

1487
00:52:49,235 --> 00:52:52,672
SPONSORED BY THUMB ICE.

1488
00:52:52,672 --> 00:52:59,846
DID YOU WHACK YOUR THUMB WITH A

1489
00:52:52,672 --> 00:52:59,846
HAMMER LIKE A CARTOON IDIOT?

1490
00:52:52,672 --> 00:52:59,846
NUMB THE PAIN WITH THUMB ICE.

1491
00:52:59,846 --> 00:53:01,781
OUR FIRST GUEST IS TOMMY DORIAN,

1492
00:52:59,846 --> 00:53:01,781
WHO SAID HE TRIED TO INSTALL HIS

1493
00:52:59,846 --> 00:53:01,781
OWN POOL.

1494
00:53:01,781 --> 00:53:07,787
UH-OH.

1495
00:53:01,781 --> 00:53:07,787
COME ON IN, TOMMY.

1497
00:53:07,787 --> 00:53:10,757
ALL RIGHT.

1498
00:53:07,787 --> 00:53:10,757
WELL, LOOKS LIKE YOUR HAIR'S

1499
00:53:07,787 --> 00:53:10,757
STILL A LITTLE WET FROM THE POOL

1500
00:53:10,757 --> 00:53:16,162
THERE, TOMMY.

1501
00:53:10,757 --> 00:53:16,162
>> NO, THAT'S UNRELATED.

1502
00:53:16,162 --> 00:53:24,304
>> OKAY.

1503
00:53:16,162 --> 00:53:24,304
SO TELL US, WHAT WAS BEHIND YOUR

1504
00:53:16,162 --> 00:53:24,304
THINKING BEHIND BUILDING YOUR

1505
00:53:24,304 --> 00:53:26,339
OWN POOL?

1506
00:53:24,304 --> 00:53:26,339
>> WELL, MY NEIGHBOR PUT ONE IN.

1507
00:53:24,304 --> 00:53:26,339
HIRED A WHOLE CREW AND AN

1508
00:53:26,339 --> 00:53:28,108
ARCHITECT.

1509
00:53:26,339 --> 00:53:28,108
THE WHOLE NINE YARDS.

1510
00:53:26,339 --> 00:53:28,108
I THOUGHT, IT'S BASICALLY A HOLE

1511
00:53:28,108 --> 00:53:31,845
PLUS A HOSE.

1512
00:53:28,108 --> 00:53:31,845
WHY OVERTHINK IT?

1513
00:53:28,108 --> 00:53:31,845
>> UH-HUH.

1514
00:53:31,845 --> 00:53:36,149
AND WHEN DID THINGS GO WRONG?

1515
00:53:31,845 --> 00:53:36,149
>> ALMOST IMMEDIATELY, GUS.

1516
00:53:31,845 --> 00:53:36,149
MY PROBLEM STARTED WHEN I TRIED

1517
00:53:36,149 --> 00:53:39,686
TO POUR THE CONCRETE WHILE I WAS

1518
00:53:36,149 --> 00:53:39,686
STILL DIGGING, TO SAVE TIME.

1519
00:53:36,149 --> 00:53:39,686
>> OH, WOW.

1520
00:53:39,686 --> 00:53:43,656
>> OH WOW IS RIGHT.

1521
00:53:39,686 --> 00:53:43,656
CUT TO, I'M UP TO MY WAIST IN

1522
00:53:39,686 --> 00:53:43,656
HARD CONCRETE SCREAMING, "HELP!

1523
00:53:43,656 --> 00:53:46,659
SOMEONE TURN OFF THE HOSE!"

1524
00:53:43,656 --> 00:53:46,659
>> SO YOU WERE ALREADY RUNNING

1525
00:53:43,656 --> 00:53:46,659
THE HOSE?

1526
00:53:46,659 --> 00:53:51,231
>> TO FILL THE POOL, TO SAVE

1527
00:53:46,659 --> 00:53:51,231
TIME, YES.

1528
00:53:46,659 --> 00:53:51,231
HAD TO HAVE IT OPEN FOR NEW

1529
00:53:51,231 --> 00:53:54,200
YEAR'S.

1530
00:53:51,231 --> 00:53:54,200
>> WELL, LOOKING BACK, ANY

1531
00:53:51,231 --> 00:53:54,200
REGRETS?

1532
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:58,271
>> I DO WISH I HADN'T PUNCTURED

1533
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:58,271
MY SEPTIC TANK.

1534
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:58,271
THAT'S A WHOLE DIFFERENT KIND OF

1535
00:53:58,271 --> 00:54:14,621
POOL.

1536
00:53:58,271 --> 00:54:14,621
>> THANKS FOR COMING, TOMMY.

1537
00:53:58,271 --> 00:54:14,621
>> THANKS FOR ALLOWING ME.

1538
00:54:14,621 --> 00:54:17,157
>> ALL RIGHT.

1539
00:54:17,157 --> 00:54:20,060
OUR NEXT GUEST THOUGHT THAT HE

1540
00:54:17,157 --> 00:54:20,060
SHOULD, QUOTE, DO HIS OWN

1541
00:54:17,157 --> 00:54:20,060
ELECTRICAL.

1542
00:54:20,060 --> 00:54:27,334
PLEASE WELCOME FELIX CREWE!

1543
00:54:20,060 --> 00:54:27,334
**

1544
00:54:20,060 --> 00:54:27,334
>> HEY GUS.

1545
00:54:27,334 --> 00:54:35,709
LONG TIME, FIRST TIME.

1546
00:54:27,334 --> 00:54:35,709
>> YOU MEAN, LONG TIME WATCH,

1547
00:54:27,334 --> 00:54:35,709
FIRST-TIME GUEST?

1548
00:54:35,709 --> 00:54:38,845
>> NO.

1549
00:54:35,709 --> 00:54:38,845
FIRST TIME ELECTROCUTED.

1550
00:54:35,709 --> 00:54:38,845
LONG TIME IT HURT.

1551
00:54:38,845 --> 00:54:41,481
>> SO, HOW DID YOU DECIDE TO DO

1552
00:54:38,845 --> 00:54:41,481
YOUR OWN ELECTRICAL WORK?

1553
00:54:41,481 --> 00:54:43,249
>> WELL, I KEEP TELLING MY WIFE,

1554
00:54:41,481 --> 00:54:43,249
IT'S JUST WIRES.

1555
00:54:41,481 --> 00:54:43,249
BABE, IT'S JUST WIRES.

1556
00:54:43,249 --> 00:54:48,988
HONEY, NOTHING'S GOING TO

1557
00:54:43,249 --> 00:54:48,988
HAPPEN, IT'S WIRES.

1558
00:54:43,249 --> 00:54:48,988
>> RIGHT.

1559
00:54:48,988 --> 00:54:53,393
>> YOU KNOW WHEN YOU SEE A GUY

1560
00:54:48,988 --> 00:54:53,393
DEFUSING BOMBS IN THE MOVIES YOU

1561
00:54:48,988 --> 00:54:53,393
THINK, I COULD DO THAT?

1562
00:54:53,393 --> 00:54:56,830
>> I'VE NEVER THOUGHT THAT.

1563
00:54:53,393 --> 00:54:56,830
>> WELL, I HAVE A LOT.

1564
00:54:53,393 --> 00:54:56,830
SO I THOUGHT, "WHAT THE HELL,

1565
00:54:56,830 --> 00:55:00,600
I'M GOING TO INSTALL MY OWN

1566
00:54:56,830 --> 00:55:00,600
CIRCUIT BREAKER."

1567
00:54:56,830 --> 00:55:00,600
>> OH, MY GOD.

1568
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:07,941
>> NO, TRUST ME, THERE IS NO

1569
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:07,941
GOD.

1570
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:07,941
NOW, THE WHOLE IDEA OF A BREAKER

1571
00:55:07,941 --> 00:55:13,680
IS TO STOP A POWER SURGE, RIGHT?

1572
00:55:07,941 --> 00:55:13,680
SO, I THINK I SHOULD START WITH

1573
00:55:07,941 --> 00:55:13,680
THE POWER DIALED ALL THE WAY UP

1574
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:16,850
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT I'M TRYING

1575
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:16,850
TO PROTECT MYSELF AGAINST,

1576
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:16,850
RIGHT?

1577
00:55:16,850 --> 00:55:20,320
>> THAT IS VERY BAD LOGIC.

1578
00:55:16,850 --> 00:55:20,320
>> SO I GOT THIS THING CRANKED

1579
00:55:16,850 --> 00:55:20,320
UP HIGHER THAN LIGHTNING AND I'M

1580
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:27,527
LIKE, "TIME TO SCREW IN THE

1581
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:27,527
METAL SCREWS," RIGHT?

1582
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:27,527
>> NO, NOT RIGHT.

1583
00:55:27,527 --> 00:55:33,667
>> CUT TO -- I FLY SO HARD

1584
00:55:27,527 --> 00:55:33,667
THROUGH A SHEET OF DRYWALL THAT

1585
00:55:27,527 --> 00:55:33,667
MY SCREAM PHYSICALLY DETACHES

1586
00:55:33,667 --> 00:55:35,735
FROM MY BODY AND TRAVELS AT A

1587
00:55:33,667 --> 00:55:35,735
SLOWER SPEED.

1588
00:55:33,667 --> 00:55:35,735
KIND OF LIKE PETER PAN'S SHADOW

1589
00:55:35,735 --> 00:55:40,840
DETACHING FROM HIS BODY.

1590
00:55:35,735 --> 00:55:40,840
>> YEAH, GOT IT.

1591
00:55:35,735 --> 00:55:40,840
>> SO AFTER I HIT A STEEL

1592
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:46,212
SUPPORT COLUMN, WIPING OUT THE

1593
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:46,212
ENTIRE FIRST FLOOR OF MY HOME, I

1594
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:46,212
AM HIT IN THE FACE BY MY OWN

1595
00:55:46,212 --> 00:55:51,918
SCREAM.

1596
00:55:46,212 --> 00:55:51,918
WILD, RIGHT?

1597
00:55:46,212 --> 00:55:51,918
>> WOW.

1598
00:55:51,918 --> 00:55:53,987
AND WHAT DID YOU LEARN FROM ALL

1599
00:55:51,918 --> 00:55:53,987
OF THIS?

1600
00:55:51,918 --> 00:55:53,987
>> GLOVES.

1601
00:55:53,987 --> 00:56:04,431
YOU'VE GOT TO WEAR GLOVES.

1602
00:55:53,987 --> 00:56:04,431
>> WELL, THANK YOU, FELIX.

1603
00:55:53,987 --> 00:56:04,431
>> EXCITED TO GET MY CHECK.

1604
00:56:04,431 --> 00:56:06,866
>> THERE'S NO CHECK.

1605
00:56:04,431 --> 00:56:06,866
>> ALL RIGHT.

1606
00:56:06,866 --> 00:56:11,237
AND OUR FINAL GUEST SAYS THAT

1607
00:56:06,866 --> 00:56:11,237
SHE'S BEEN TRYING TO REPAIR HER

1608
00:56:06,866 --> 00:56:11,237
HOME FOR MONTHS.

1609
00:56:11,237 --> 00:56:15,308
PLEASE WELCOME -- THIS CAN'T BE

1610
00:56:11,237 --> 00:56:15,308
RIGHT.

1611
00:56:11,237 --> 00:56:15,308
MY WIFE CARLISA.

1612
00:56:15,308 --> 00:56:19,679
**

1613
00:56:15,308 --> 00:56:19,679
HEY, BABY.

1614
00:56:15,308 --> 00:56:19,679
UH, WHAT YOU DOING HERE?

1615
00:56:19,679 --> 00:56:24,417
>> JUST TRYING TO REPAIR MY

1616
00:56:19,679 --> 00:56:24,417
HOME.

1617
00:56:19,679 --> 00:56:24,417
THIS DAMN FOOL IS OUT HERE

1618
00:56:24,417 --> 00:56:28,822
PRETENDING HE'S A BIG EXPERT.

1619
00:56:24,417 --> 00:56:28,822
MEANWHILE, HIS OWN HOUSE IS

1620
00:56:24,417 --> 00:56:28,822
LITERALLY FALLING APART.

1621
00:56:28,822 --> 00:56:32,692
>> WELL, IF YOU HAVE A PROBLEM,

1622
00:56:28,822 --> 00:56:32,692
BABY, I'M HAPPY TO FIX IT.

1623
00:56:28,822 --> 00:56:32,692
>> WITH WHAT?

1624
00:56:32,692 --> 00:56:36,696
THIS IS YOUR TOOLBOX.

1625
00:56:32,692 --> 00:56:36,696
BUT THERE AREN'T NO TOOLS IN

1626
00:56:32,692 --> 00:56:36,696
HERE, THOUGH.

1627
00:56:36,696 --> 00:56:39,833
IT'S JUST CANS OF BLACK'S BEER.

1628
00:56:36,696 --> 00:56:39,833
>> HEY, I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR

1629
00:56:36,696 --> 00:56:39,833
THOSE.

1630
00:56:39,833 --> 00:56:45,672
>> THERE'S NO TOOLS IN THIS

1631
00:56:39,833 --> 00:56:45,672
WHOLE GOOFY-ASS WORKSHOP.

1632
00:56:39,833 --> 00:56:45,672
IT'S JUST CHOCOLATE BARS THAT

1633
00:56:45,672 --> 00:56:50,343
LOOK LIKE TOOLS.

1634
00:56:45,672 --> 00:56:50,343
>> WELL, SOMETIMES I GET A

1635
00:56:45,672 --> 00:56:50,343
LITTLE HUNGRY.

1636
00:56:50,343 --> 00:56:53,079
>> MEANWHILE, OUR TOILET HASN'T

1637
00:56:50,343 --> 00:56:53,079
WORKED IN MONTHS.

1638
00:56:50,343 --> 00:56:53,079
I OPENED THE LID OF THE TANK AND

1639
00:56:53,079 --> 00:57:02,188
SAW THIS.

1640
00:56:53,079 --> 00:57:02,188
>> WELL, YOU NEVER KNOW WHEN YOU

1641
00:56:53,079 --> 00:57:02,188
MIGHT NEED AN ICE COLD HOT DOG.

1642
00:57:02,188 --> 00:57:07,327
>> AND THEN YOU SNUCK SOME

1643
00:57:02,188 --> 00:57:07,327
CRUSHED UP PEANUT SHELLS INTO

1644
00:57:02,188 --> 00:57:07,327
OUR SON'S LUNCH TO PROVE THAT HE

1645
00:57:07,327 --> 00:57:21,574
WAS FAKING HIS PEANUT ALLERGY.

1646
00:57:07,327 --> 00:57:21,574
>> WELL, THE IMPORTANT THING IS

1647
00:57:07,327 --> 00:57:21,574
THAT I TRUST YOU NOW.

1648
00:57:21,574 --> 00:57:24,044
I STILL THINK HE MAY BE

1649
00:57:21,574 --> 00:57:24,044
EXAGGERATING A LITTLE BIT.

1650
00:57:21,574 --> 00:57:24,044
>> GUS.

1651
00:57:24,044 --> 00:57:25,879
WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO SAY FOR

1652
00:57:24,044 --> 00:57:25,879
YOURSELF?

1653
00:57:24,044 --> 00:57:25,879
>> LOOK.

1654
00:57:25,879 --> 00:57:27,914
I THINK IT'S PRETTY CLEAR THAT I

1655
00:57:25,879 --> 00:57:27,914
AM --

1656
00:57:25,879 --> 00:57:27,914
* IN OVER MY HEAD *

1657
00:57:27,914 --> 00:57:32,452
>> NO, NO, NO.

1658
00:57:27,914 --> 00:57:32,452
DON'T YOU DARE SING THAT DAMN

1659
00:57:27,914 --> 00:57:32,452
JINGLE TO ME, NO.

1660
00:57:32,452 --> 00:57:38,692
THIS MAN SUCKED UP A WASP NEST

1661
00:57:32,452 --> 00:57:38,692
WITH A VACUUM AND NOW HE WON'T

1662
00:57:32,452 --> 00:57:38,692
EVEN THROW IT AWAY.

1663
00:57:38,692 --> 00:57:42,829
>> LISTEN, DYSON --

1664
00:57:38,692 --> 00:57:42,829
>> IDIOT.

1665
00:57:38,692 --> 00:57:42,829
YOU'S AN IDIOT.

1666
00:57:42,829 --> 00:57:45,565

01:01:54,814 --> 01:02:00,320
PEOPLE BEFORE.

1822
01:02:00,320 --> 01:02:03,723
THIS ONE'S CALLED "THE APOGEE OF

THE START OF ANOTHER LATE NIGHT.

1830

ALONE IN CHANDLER HIGH.

1832
01:02:12,365 --> 01:02:16,536
BUT THE JANITOR LIKED THE

1833
01:02:12,365 --> 01:02:16,536
SILENCE.

1834
01:02:16,536 --> 01:02:21,107

01:02:16,536 --> 01:02:21,107
>> HM, WOW, I REALLY LIKE THAT.

1837
01:02:21,107 --> 01:02:27,547
>> THANK YOU.

1838
01:02:21,107 --> 01:02:27,547
THEN, FOOTSTEPS.

1839
01:02:21,107 --> 01:02:27,547
LOUD AND GETTING CLOSER.

1840
01:02:27,547 --> 01:02:33,286
HELLO?

1841
01:02:27,547 --> 01:02:33,286
SCHOOL'S CLOSED.

1842
01:02:27,547 --> 01:02:33,286
A WOMAN TURNED THE CORNER.

1843
01:02:33,286 --> 01:02:37,290
SHE LOOKED LOST.

1844
01:02:33,286 --> 01:02:37,290
SORRY, I'M LOOKING FOR SOMEONE

1845
01:02:33,286 --> 01:02:37,290
NAMED MIKE?

1846
01:02:37,290 --> 01:02:43,763
OH, YEAH?

1847
01:02:37,290 --> 01:02:43,763
WHO'S ASKING?

1848
01:02:37,290 --> 01:02:43,763
MY NAME IS DUA LIPA.

1849
01:02:43,763 --> 01:02:47,901
I'M A BIG POP STAR AND I'M

1850
01:02:43,763 --> 01:02:47,901

01:02:43,763 --> 01:02:47,901
MIKE.

1852
01:02:47,901 --> 01:02:55,308
>> OKAY.

1853
01:02:47,901 --> 01:02:55,308
>> THE JANITOR PAUSED.

1854
01:02:47,901 --> 01:02:55,308
THAT WAS HIS NAME.

1855
01:02:55,308 --> 01:03:00,513
DUA LIPA SIGHED.

1856
01:02:55,308 --> 01:03:00,513
YOU HAVEN'T HEARD OF ME, HAVE

1857
01:02:55,308 --> 01:03:00,513
YOU?

1858
01:03:00,513 --> 01:03:04,651
SORRY, MA'AM.

1859
01:03:00,513 --> 01:03:04,651
MORE OF A CLASSIC ROCK GUY

1860
01:03:00,513 --> 01:03:04,651
MYSELF.

1861
01:03:04,651 --> 01:03:08,555
BUT SURE, MAYBE I'VE SEEN A

1862
01:03:04,651 --> 01:03:08,555
BIKINI PIC OR TWO, HOW CAN I

1863
01:03:04,651 --> 01:03:08,555
HELP?

1864
01:03:08,555 --> 01:03:14,594
>> OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT, IT IS

1865
01:03:08,555 --> 01:03:14,594
GETTING PRETTY LATE.

1866
01:03:08,555 --> 01:03:14,594
SO I THINK WE SHOULD PROBABLY

1867
01:03:14,594 --> 01:03:16,196
WRAP IT UP.

1868
01:03:14,594 --> 01:03:16,196
>> WHAT?

1869
01:03:14,594 --> 01:03:16,196
HE JUST STARTED.

1870
01:03:16,196 --> 01:03:19,632
>> WRAP UP?

1871
01:03:16,196 --> 01:03:19,632
SO I CAN MOP?

1872
01:03:16,196 --> 01:03:19,632
HECK, I GOT TIME.

1873
01:03:19,632 --> 01:03:23,503
>> YEAH, AND I WANT TO KNOW

1874
01:03:19,632 --> 01:03:23,503
WHERE IT'S GOING.

1875
01:03:19,632 --> 01:03:23,503
>> I DON'T.

1876
01:03:23,503 --> 01:03:28,108
>> YEAH, I THINK I'M GOOD.

1877
01:03:23,503 --> 01:03:28,108
>> YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.

1878
01:03:23,503 --> 01:03:28,108
I'M BAD AT THIS.

1879
01:03:28,108 --> 01:03:32,612
>> NO, NO.

1880
01:03:28,108 --> 01:03:32,612
WE SUPPORT IT.

1881
01:03:28,108 --> 01:03:32,612
SO PLEASE, GO AHEAD.

1882
01:03:32,612 --> 01:03:37,550
>> OH, THANK YOU.

1883
01:03:32,612 --> 01:03:37,550
MIND IF I SIT DOWN?

1884
01:03:32,612 --> 01:03:37,550
DUA LIPA WAS EXHAUSTED.

1885
01:03:37,550 --> 01:03:42,088
SHE'D JUST DONE A CONCERT IN

1886
01:03:37,550 --> 01:03:42,088
EUROPE.

1887
01:03:37,550 --> 01:03:42,088
AND WAS STILL IN HER SPARKLY

1888
01:03:42,088 --> 01:03:46,960
SHOW GETUP.

1889
01:03:42,088 --> 01:03:46,960
HE LIKED HER.

1890
01:03:42,088 --> 01:03:46,960
SHE WAS COOL.

1891
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:51,297
SO WHAT BRINGS YOU OUT ALL THIS

1892
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:51,297
WAY TO SEE LITTLE OLD ME,

1893
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:51,297
GIRLIE?

1894
01:03:51,297 --> 01:03:59,105
OH, I DON'T KNOW, THIS IS GOING

1895
01:03:51,297 --> 01:03:59,105
TO SOUND CRAZY.

1896
01:03:51,297 --> 01:03:59,105
COME ON, DUA LIPA, YOU KNOW YOU

1897
01:03:59,105 --> 01:04:03,610
CAN TALK TO ME.

1898
01:03:59,105 --> 01:04:03,610
I'M YOUR FRIEND.

1899
01:03:59,105 --> 01:04:03,610
IT'S TRUE.

1900
01:04:03,610 --> 01:04:08,815
THEY WERE FAST FRIENDS.

1901
01:04:03,610 --> 01:04:08,815
AND NOTHING MORE.

1902
01:04:03,610 --> 01:04:08,815
RIGHT?

1903
01:04:08,815 --> 01:04:18,224
>> ARE YOU ASKING US?

1904
01:04:08,815 --> 01:04:18,224
>> PLEASE.

1905
01:04:08,815 --> 01:04:18,224
I'M STILL READING.

1906
01:04:18,224 --> 01:04:21,695
WELL, I GUESS I WANTED TO ASK

01:04:18,224 --> 01:04:21,695

01:04:21,695 --> 01:04:24,664
WHAT'S UP?

1910
01:04:21,695 --> 01:04:24,664
WOULD YOU TEACH ME HOW TO MAKE

1911
01:04:21,695 --> 01:04:24,664

1912
01:04:24,664 --> 01:04:28,268
I'VE NEVER DONE IT BEFORE.

1913
01:04:24,664 --> 01:04:28,268
>> OKAY, I'M SORRY, I JUST --

1914
01:04:24,664 --> 01:04:28,268
NO.

1915
01:04:28,268 --> 01:04:35,075
>> OH, COME ON.

1916
01:04:28,268 --> 01:04:35,075
>> WHY?

1917
01:04:28,268 --> 01:04:35,075
>> LOOK, I THINK THAT IT'S GREAT

1918
01:04:35,075 --> 01:04:39,779
THAT YOU WRITE.

1919
01:04:35,075 --> 01:04:39,779
I JUST DON'T REALLY WANT TO

1920
01:04:35,075 --> 01:04:39,779
HEAR ABOUT YOUR WEIRD, MADE-UP

1921
01:04:39,779 --> 01:04:41,247

1922
01:04:39,779 --> 01:04:41,247
I'M SORRY, I DON'T.

1923
01:04:39,779 --> 01:04:41,247
>> MY THING?

1924
01:04:41,247 --> 01:04:44,317
THIS AIN'T ME, MAMA, THIS IS

1925
01:04:41,247 --> 01:04:44,317
FICTION.

1926
01:04:41,247 --> 01:04:44,317
THIRD PERSON.

1927
01:04:44,317 --> 01:04:50,890

1929

1930
01:04:50,890 --> 01:04:56,529

1931
01:04:50,890 --> 01:04:56,529

1932
01:04:50,890 --> 01:04:56,529
WHY?

1933
01:04:56,529 --> 01:05:03,169
>> IT'S KIND OF CREEPY, MAN.

1934
01:04:56,529 --> 01:05:03,169
>> VERY CREEPY.

1935
01:04:56,529 --> 01:05:03,169
>> I SEE.

1936
01:05:03,169 --> 01:05:05,939
I GUESS I'M NOT A WRITER AFTER

1937
01:05:03,169 --> 01:05:05,939
ALL.

1938
01:05:03,169 --> 01:05:05,939
BACK TO THE TOILETS IT IS.

1939
01:05:05,939 --> 01:05:09,175
>> JUST FINISH IT, PLEASE.

1940
01:05:05,939 --> 01:05:09,175

1941
01:05:05,939 --> 01:05:09,175
OKAY.

1942
01:05:09,175 --> 01:05:14,447
SURE, DUA LIPA, I CAN TEACH YOU

1943
01:05:09,175 --> 01:05:14,447
HOW TO MAKE OUT.

1944
01:05:09,175 --> 01:05:14,447
WAIT, CAN MY FRIEND COME?

1945
01:05:14,447 --> 01:05:23,189
HER NAME IS TAWNY McDANIELS.

1946
01:05:14,447 --> 01:05:23,189
THE FAMOUS GINGER MILF?

1947
01:05:14,447 --> 01:05:23,189
ONE AND THE SAME.

1948
01:05:23,189 --> 01:05:29,763

KNOW HER?

1950
01:05:23,189 --> 01:05:29,763
I MANAGE HER SUB BRAND.

1951
01:05:29,763 --> 01:05:33,500
OF COURSE PORNOGRAPHY HASN'T

1952
01:05:29,763 --> 01:05:33,500
BEEN THE SAME SINCE THE '70s.

1953
01:05:29,763 --> 01:05:33,500
THAT'S BEFORE T.J. MUNST TOOK

OVER AT STUFFED.

1955
01:05:33,500 --> 01:05:40,373
WHEN THE MAGS HAD VISION AND THE

1956
01:05:33,500 --> 01:05:40,373
SPREADS WERE ACTUALLY GOOD.

1957
01:05:40,373 --> 01:05:43,510
>> SORRY, I DO THINK WE NEED TO

1958
01:05:40,373 --> 01:05:43,510
CALL IT THERE.

1959
01:05:40,373 --> 01:05:43,510
I'M SORRY.

1960
01:05:43,510 --> 01:05:47,247
>> OKAY, OKAY, OKAY.

1961
01:05:43,510 --> 01:05:47,247
STUFF HAPPENS, STUFF HAPPENS,

1962
01:05:43,510 --> 01:05:47,247
SO, DUA LAUGHED.

1970
01:05:58,825 --> 01:06:02,762
>> CHAPTER 2?

1971
01:05:58,825 --> 01:06:02,762
THAT WASN'T THE END?

1972
01:06:02,762 --> 01:06:08,435
>> OH, HONEY, WE GOT 800 PAGES

1973

01:06:10,603 --> 01:06:13,573
OKAY?

1980
01:06:31,458 --> 01:06:37,330
THANK YOU TO THIS AMAZING CREW

1981
