>>> GOOD EVENING,

52
00:05:56,549 --> 00:06:01,780
AND WELCOME TO THE 50th ANNIVERSARY OF
SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE.

53
00:06:02,134 --> 00:06:07,274
I'M STEVE MARTIN, "SATURDAY
NIGHT LIVE'S" NEWEST DIVERSITY
HIRE.

54
00:06:07,274 --> 00:06:09,895
WHAT A THRILL IT IS TO BE HERE.

55
00:06:09,895 --> 00:06:14,094
WHEN I HEARD "SNL" WANTED TO DO
AN ANNIVERSARY SPECIAL,

56
00:06:14,094 --> 00:06:17,270
I LITERALLY WANTED
TO LEAP IN THE AIR.

57
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:20,398
AND THE ONLY REASON I DIDN'T IS
BECAUSE AT THE TIME,

58
00:06:20,398 --> 00:06:23,354
I WAS
WEARING A SHORT SKIRT WITH NO
UNDERWEAR.

59
00:06:23,354 --> 00:06:26,219
I CAN'T BELIEVE

60
00:06:28,039 --> 00:06:31,037
I CAN'T BELIEVE I MADE IT HERE IN TIME.

61
00:06:31,037 --> 00:06:34,722
IT WAS ONLY A FEW DAYS AGO THAT
LORNE TOLD ME I WAS DOING THE MONOLOGUE,

62
00:06:34,722 --> 00:06:39,569
AND I WAS ACTUALLY
VACATIONING ON A FRIEND'S BOAT
DOWN IN THE GULF OF STEVE
MARTIN.

63
00:06:39,569 --> 00:06:42,117
BUT FINALLY,

64
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:47,347
IT TOOK ME A WHILE
TO GET HERE, BUT I DID.

65
00:06:47,347 --> 00:06:52,147
SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE, AS YOU
KNOW, TURNED 50 YEARS OLD THIS YEAR,

66
00:06:52,147 --> 00:06:55,779
AND I TURNED 79.

67
00:06:59,051 --> 00:07:03,188
BUT I FEEL LIKE I'M 65,

68
00:07:03,188 --> 00:07:05,918
WHICH IS ALSO NOT GOOD.

69
00:07:09,281 --> 00:07:12,951
NOW SERIOUSLY, I DO NOT MIND
GETTING OLDER.

70
00:07:12,951 --> 00:07:17,161
DO YOU THINK THESE HEARING AIDS
MAKE MY ASS LOOK SMALLER?
I DO.

71
00:07:19,445 --> 00:07:21,865
I'M STILL LEARNING ABOUT LIFE.

72
00:07:21,865 --> 00:07:25,161
ACTUALLY, MY WIFE, WHO IS A VERY
SMART, WISE PERSON,

73
00:07:25,161 --> 00:07:26,530
TAUGHT ME
SOMETHING THE OTHER DAY.

74
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:28,063
SHE SAT ME DOWN, AND SHE SAID,

75
00:07:28,063 --> 00:07:32,987
"STEVE, YOU KNOW, BABIES DON'T"
GET SARCASM."

76
00:07:36,109 --> 00:07:41,179
AND I REALIZED I'D BEEN WASTING
MY TIME GOING UP TO STROLLERS IN THE STREET

77
00:07:41,179 --> 00:07:44,329
SAYING, "OH, WHAT A
CUTE BABY!"

78
00:07:48,933 --> 00:07:52,445
NOW, A FUN FACT.

79
00:07:52,445 --> 00:07:56,792
A PERSON BORN DURING FIRST
SEASON OF "SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE"

80
00:07:56,792 --> 00:08:01,298
COULD TODAY BE EASILY DEAD OF
NATURAL CAUSES.

81
00:08:04,701 --> 00:08:07,876
NOW YOU'RE GOING TO SEE A LOT OF
FAMILIAR THINGS TONIGHT.

82
00:08:07,876 --> 00:08:11,122
MUSICAL GUESTS, SKETCHES, CAMEO
APPEARANCES, THE NEWS.

83
00:08:11,122 --> 00:08:13,396
AND THIS IS THE MONOLOGUE.

84
00:08:13,396 --> 00:08:16,960
TRADITIONALLY, THE WEAKEST PART
OF THE SHOW.

85
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:21,137
YES, THE MONOLOGUE IS LIKE A
RENT-CONTROLLED TENANT.

86
00:08:21,137 --> 00:08:25,244
IT'S NOT GOING ANYWHERE, EVEN
THOUGH IT STINKS.

87
00:08:25,244 --> 00:08:28,928
AND THERE ARE SO MANY MEMBERS OF
THE "SNL" FAMILY HERE TONIGHT.

88
00:08:28,928 --> 00:08:31,646
THE GREAT BILL MURRAY IS HERE.

89
00:08:34,565 --> 00:08:38,180
WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE BILL
WOULD BE HERE TONIGHT

90
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:40,788
SO WE
DIDN'T INVITE HIM.

91
00:08:42,988 --> 00:08:46,238
AND DAVID LETTERMAN IS HERE.

92
00:08:50,067 --> 00:08:54,302
DAVE, THANKS FOR LEAVING THE
SHEEP AT HOME.

93
00:08:56,378 --> 00:09:00,946
AND WE CAN'T FORGET THE WRITERS
WHO HAVE ALWAYS BEEN

94
00:09:00,946 --> 00:09:03,630
THE HEART
AND SOUL OF "SNL."

95
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:05,908
IN FACT, LET'S PLEASE HAVE THE
GREAT WRITERS

96
00:09:05,908 --> 00:09:10,726
FROM THE PAST 50
YEARS STAND UP AND TAKE A BOW.

97
00:09:19,179 --> 00:09:22,008
BY THE WAY, THAT TRIBUTE TO THE WRITERS

98
00:09:22,008 --> 00:09:24,850
WAS WRITTEN BY AI.

99
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:27,583
OH MY GOD!

100
00:09:28,358 --> 00:09:31,209
JOHN MULANEY!
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE GOING TO
BE HERE.

101
00:09:31,209 --> 00:09:33,678
>> YOU WOULD IF YOU'D EVER COME
TO REHEARSAL.

102
00:09:33,678 --> 00:09:36,510
BY THE WAY, CONGRATULATIONS ON

00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:39,542
>> GRAMMY NOMINATION.
>> NOPE.

106
00:09:39,542 --> 00:09:40,601
>> GOLDEN GLOBE WIN?

107
00:09:40,601 --> 00:09:42,882
>> GOLDEN GLOBE NOMINATION?
>> YES, SIR, AND THANK YOU.

108
00:09:42,882 --> 00:09:46,004
>> YOU KNOW, WE WRITERS REALLY
APPRECIATED THAT TRIBUTE,

109
00:09:46,004 --> 00:09:49,356
BUT I
BELIEVE THE HEART AND SOUL OF
THIS SHOW

110
00:09:49,356 --> 00:09:51,826
IS THE CELEBRITY
HOSTS.

111
00:09:51,826 --> 00:09:54,511
MANY OF WHOM ARE IN THIS ROOM
TONIGHT.

112
00:09:54,511 --> 00:09:59,163
YOU KNOW, AS I LOOK AROUND, I
SEE SOME OF THE MOST DIFFICULT PEOPLE

113
00:09:59,163 --> 00:10:03,005
I HAVE EVER MET IN MY
ENTIRE LIFE.

114
00:10:03,005 --> 00:10:08,111
OVER THE COURSE OF 50 YEARS, 894
PEOPLE HAVE HOSTED "SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE,"

115
00:10:08,111 --> 00:10:12,834
AND IT AMAZES ME
THAT ONLY TWO OF THEM HAVE
COMMITTED MURDER.

116
00:10:14,784 --> 00:10:20,513
EACH WEEK, EACH WEEK A NEW
CELEBRITY HOST COMES IN WITH
THEIR OWN DYNAMIC

117
00:10:20,513 --> 00:10:22,376
AND THEY THROW
EVERYTHING OFF.

118
00:10:22,376 --> 00:10:23,998
BUT NOT YOU, STEVE,

119
00:10:23,998 --> 00:10:27,426
BECAUSE YOU HAVE NO DYNAMIC.
>> THANK YOU.

120
00:10:27,629 --> 00:10:30,883
>> OH MY GOD!

121
00:10:34,566 --> 00:10:39,361
>> LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THE
ONLY CANADIAN WHO WASN'T IN
SCHITT'S CREEK,

MARTIN SHORT.

123
00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:47,635
>> WAIT A SECOND, I THOUGHT WE
WERE HOSTING TOGETHER.

124
00:10:47,635 --> 00:10:50,812
>> DO YOU HAVE YOUR PASSPORT
WITH YOU?
>> NO.

125
00:10:50,812 --> 00:10:52,117
>> I.C.E., GET HIM!

126
00:10:52,117 --> 00:10:55,412
>> NO!
I'LL COOPERATE!
DON'T TAKE ME.

127
00:10:55,412 --> 00:10:58,509
I'LL NAME NAMES.

CATHERINE

129
00:10:59,877 --> 00:11:03,915
DAMN YOU, YOU WHITE-HAIRED SON
OF A BITCH!

130
00:11:09,198 --> 00:11:12,237
>> MARTY AND I HAVE BEEN WORKING
TOGETHER SO LONG

131
00:11:12,237 --> 00:11:16,264
THAT WE CAN
ACTUALLY FINISH EACH OTHER'S
CAREERS.

132
00:11:16,481 --> 00:11:22,876
I HOPE YOU ARE ENJOYING MY
MONOLOGUE TONIGHT.

133
00:11:22,876 --> 00:11:25,804
BUT IF YOU AREN'T ENJOYING IT --

134
00:11:26,871 --> 00:11:31,154
MAYBE YOU SHOULD GET UP AND TAKE
A GOOD LOOK AT YOURSELF IN THE MIRROR

135
00:11:31,154 --> 00:11:35,391
AND SAY TO YOURSELF, WHAT
HAVE I BECOME?

136
00:11:35,391 --> 00:11:38,054
THIS CAN'T BE STEVE'S FAULT.

137
00:11:38,054 --> 00:11:43,356
AND ASK YOURSELVES,
WHEN DID I ABANDON JOY?

138
00:11:43,356 --> 00:11:46,305
AND WHAT CAN I BRING TO THE
MONOLOGUE

139
00:11:46,305 --> 00:11:50,450
AS AN AUDIENCE MEMBER
NEXT TIME.

140
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:53,715
ALL RIGHT, WE'VE GOT A GREAT
SHOW TONIGHT.

141
00:11:57,850 --> 00:12:01,830
WE HAVE A GREAT SHOW.

331

TODAY'S BLACK JEOPARDY IS

339

IT'S AN HONOR TO BE HERE ON
BLACK JEOPARDY.

353
00:25:02,348 --> 00:25:05,518
I'VE BEEN A FAN OF THE SHOW SINCE THE '70s

354
00:25:05,518 --> 00:25:09,043
WHEN IT WAS
CALLED "MAMA'S GOT QUESTIONS."

355
00:25:09,043 --> 00:25:13,322
OKAY.
NOW SOME OF Y'ALL MIGHT REMEMBER
ME FROM "SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE."

356
00:25:13,322 --> 00:25:16,910
I WAS A BLACK GUY WHO CAME AFTER
EDDIE MURPHY.

357
00:25:16,910 --> 00:25:21,293
THAT'S KIND OF LIKE BEING A THE
POINT GUARD AFTER STEPHEN CURRY.

358
00:25:21,293 --> 00:25:26,243
OKAY.
HERE IS YOUR CLUE ABOUT "SNL."

359
00:25:26,243 --> 00:25:31,604
THIS WAS CHARACTER HAS MADE
PEOPLE LAUGH FOR YEARS.

360
00:25:31,604 --> 00:25:34,300
>> WHO IS MY DEAR?

00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:37,733
>> NO.
THAT IS NOT TYLER PERRY.

362
00:25:37,733 --> 00:25:40,372
CAN'T YOU SEE THAT SHE IS RIGHT?

363
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:42,454
DOUG

364
00:25:42,454 --> 00:25:44,772
HI

365

367
00:25:51,890 --> 00:25:55,212

>> THANK YOU.

370
00:25:59,792 --> 00:26:02,298
SPEAKING OF CHURCH, CAN I SAY
SOMETHING?

371
00:26:02,298 --> 00:26:04,817
IT'S MORE FOLKS WENT TO CHURCH,

372
00:26:04,817 --> 00:26:07,572
WE WOULDN'T BE IN THIS MESS
WE'RE IN NOW.

373
00:26:07,572 --> 00:26:11,225
>> I WOULD LIKE TO SHAKE YOUR
HAND, SIR.
HERE WE GO.

374
00:26:11,225 --> 00:26:14,853
NO

375
00:26:14,853 --> 00:26:17,972
JUST

376
00:26:17,972 --> 00:26:21,191
>> THANK YOU,

377
00:26:21,191 --> 00:26:24,253
NOW MAYBE I'LL START A SHOW FOR YOU TO COME ON

378
00:26:24,253 --> 00:26:26,751
AND WE'LL CALL IT "WHITE
JEOPARDY."

379
00:26:26,751 --> 00:26:29,285
>> WE DON'T NEED IT.
WE DON'T NEED IT.

380
00:26:29,285 --> 00:26:31,708
SLOW IT DOWN A LITTLE BIT.

381
00:26:31,708 --> 00:26:34,844
WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A BREAK.
WHEN WE RETURN TO "BLACK JEOPARDY,"

382
00:26:34,844 --> 00:26:38,278
WE WILL SEE IF ANYONE
HAS WATCHED ANY OF THIS YEAR'S
OSCAR MOVIES.

383
00:26:38,278 --> 00:26:41,193
DOUBT.
WE'LL SEE YOU.

384
00:26:53,398 --> 00:26:55,889
HI

385
00:26:56,477 --> 00:26:59,421
TONIGHT IS A CELEBRATION OF
CLASSIC MOMENTS,

386
00:26:59,421 --> 00:27:02,428
BUT "SNL" WILL
ALWAYS HAVE THAT CONTRARIAN EDGE,

387
00:27:02,428 --> 00:27:06,983
NEVER WANTING TO DO
ANYTHING THAT FEELS TOO OBVIOUS,
TOO ON THE NOSE.

388
00:27:12,066 --> 00:27:14,153
UP HERE?

389
00:27:14,153 --> 00:27:17,803

00:27:17,803 --> 00:27:24,979

I'M PROUD TO SAY I'M 50 YEARS OLD,

392
00:27:31,617 --> 00:27:35,168
JUST LIKE "SATURDAY NIGHT

393
00:27:35,168 --> 00:27:40,371
LISTEN, EMMA, SHE IS NOT ONE
OF THE GALS WHO IS AFRAID TO TELL A REAL,

394
00:27:40,371 --> 00:27:42,508
SHE LIKES TO KICK,

395
00:27:42,508 --> 00:27:45,164

>> THE WHOLE NOYFNT SKETCH IS TO
SHOW YOUR FALL.

406
00:28:28,128 --> 00:28:32,323
PEOPLE EXPECT TO SEE YOU FALL.
IT'S A TRADITION.

407
00:28:40,157 --> 00:28:42,404
NO, ABSOLUTELY NOT.
I'M NOT DOING IT.

408

UNCOMFORTABLE.

413
00:30:13,964 --> 00:30:17,169
>> NO I'M NOT.
>> YOU KIND OF ARE.

414
00:30:20,439 --> 00:30:22,950
REBECCA

415

417
00:30:37,236 --> 00:30:40,558

425
00:31:29,135 --> 00:31:30,505
MY MOUTH.

ANYWAY

433
00:32:51,571 --> 00:32:56,554
>> WHEN OUR DAUGHTER KELSEY TOLD
US THAT SHE AND MATT WANTED TO
DO A VOWEL RENEWAL,

434
00:32:56,554 --> 00:33:00,118
WE WERE A
LITTLE SURPRISED SINCE THEY'VE
ONLY BEEN MARRIED LESS THAN A YEAR,

435
00:33:00,118 --> 00:33:02,095
BUT HEY,

00:33:28,908 --> 00:33:30,922
KELSEY AND MATT --

I'M SOPHIE, THE BRIDE'S
CHILDHOOD BESTIE.

452
00:34:07,365 --> 00:34:10,030
I COULDN'T MAKE IT TO THE
WEDDING BECAUSE I WAS
UNFORTUNATELY IN PRISON.

453
00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:12,897
>> YOU GOT SO SKINNY IN JAIL,
GIRL.

454
00:34:12,897 --> 00:34:15,754
>> I KNOW, RIGHT?
I COULDN'T EAT THE FOOD.

455
00:34:15,754 --> 00:34:17,636
ANY WAY,

456
00:34:17,636 --> 00:34:22,359
I'D LOVE TO INVITE KELSEY'S BEST FRIENDS AKA, THE
KEL SQUAD.

GOING TO DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT FOR Y'ALL,

459
00:34:27,312 --> 00:34:32,152
BECAUSE WE'RE A
LITTLE BIT BASIC, A LITTLE BIT
TOXIC.

460
00:34:32,152 --> 00:34:37,015
>> SO AS SOME OF YOU KNOW, WE
TOOK KELSEY TO CITY TO CELEBRATE
RENEWAL.

461
00:34:37,015 --> 00:34:42,413
>> MATT SAID IT HAD TO BE A DAY
TRIP BECAUSE HE DOESN'T TRUST
OVERNIGHTS ANYMORE.

462
00:34:42,413 --> 00:34:44,230
>> GUILTY AS CHARGED.

463
00:34:44,230 --> 00:34:47,226
SERIOUSLY, I LOVE STRONG WOMEN.

464
00:34:47,226 --> 00:34:52,260
>> WHILE IN NEW YORK, WE GOT
BLACKOUT DRUNK AND WENT TO
WICKED.

465
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:56,188
SO MATT AND KELSEY, THIS IS FOR
YOU.

466
00:34:58,883 --> 00:35:02,138
HAS CHANGED

467
00:35:02,138 --> 00:35:04,881
SHE'S READY TO COMMIT ¶

468
00:35:04,881 --> 00:35:07,931
¶ SEES A THING IN MATTHEW

469
00:35:07,931 --> 00:35:12,529
THAT HONESTLY WE DO NOT GET ¶

470
00:35:12,530 --> 00:35:13,881
LADIES

471
00:35:13,881 --> 00:35:16,110
¶ AND WORKED ON HERSELF,

472
00:35:16,110 --> 00:35:19,245
AND MATT HAS GONE TO THE GYM ¶

473
00:35:19,245 --> 00:35:21,790
KELSEY HAS MADE A COMMITMENT,

474
00:35:21,790 --> 00:35:24,127
SO GUESS WHAT?
THIS JUST IN ¶

475
00:35:24,127 --> 00:35:30,418
¶ SHE'S GOING TO TRY MONOGAMY,

476
00:35:30,418 --> 00:35:36,167
SHE'S FINALLY LEARNED WHAT IS
MONOGAMY ¶

477
00:35:36,167 --> 00:35:41,859
¶ AND WE WILL HOLD HER DAWN ¶

478
00:35:47,354 --> 00:35:48,785
>> HEY, WELL, THAT WAS GREAT.

479
00:35:48,785 --> 00:35:52,299
AND NOW THE SONG IS OVER, AND WE
WILL NOT LEARN ANYTHING ELSE.

480
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:55,555
>> REALLY?
BECAUSE A LOT MORE HAPPENED.

481
00:35:55,555 --> 00:35:59,373
>> OH MY GOD, DOING TAYLOR.

482
00:36:00,050 --> 00:36:04,695
¶ AFTER THE SHOW, IN TIMES SQUARE,

483
00:36:04,695 --> 00:36:08,423
THERE IS A WHACK KIAN
KNOW REEVES, BUT KELSEY DOESN'T CARE

484
00:36:08,423 --> 00:36:13,992
IT'S CLEAR THAT KELSEY'S
MIND IS ELSEWHERE ¶

485
00:36:13,992 --> 00:36:15,341
>> WHAT WERE YOU THINKING ABOUT?

486
00:36:15,341 --> 00:36:18,588
>> MY FRIENDS ARE SINGING.

487
00:36:18,588 --> 00:36:23,245
¶ NEXT UP WE TAKE A PEDICAB IN
CENTRAL PARK ¶

488

00:36:33,771 --> 00:36:37,514
¶ WE ALL KNOW SHE IS TALKING
ABOUT DOMINGO,

KNOW THAT YOU WERE RIGHT?

504
00:37:20,243 --> 00:37:23,194
I DO HAVE HASHIMOTO'S.

505
00:37:23,194 --> 00:37:27,229

ANOTHER MAJOR LIFE EVENT OF
MINE.

517
00:38:09,188 --> 00:38:13,942

GIRLS AFTER PRISON.

MATTHEW'S MY GUY, SAID HE'S NOT MINE,

537
00:39:13,233 --> 00:39:15,986
BUT WE DID HOOK UP,
THOUGH.

KNOW HIM?

546
00:39:41,836 --> 00:39:45,040
>> WELL, I DID THEIR KITCHEN
RENOVATION

547
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:48,403
AND THEN I HAD SEX
WITH THE WIFE.

>> FEEL YOU, SANTIAGO.

549

558
00:40:37,034 --> 00:40:41,270
WE TREASURE THE LAUGHS, THE
FRIENDSHIPS, THE FOND MEMORIES.

559
00:40:41,270 --> 00:40:45,155
BUT THE REAL TREASURE WAS HOW
MUCH MONEY WE WERE MAKING.

560
00:40:50,167 --> 00:40:56,252
LADIES

561
00:40:59,105 --> 00:41:02,099
>> OH, WOW.
WHAT A NIGHT.

562
00:41:02,099 --> 00:41:07,702
WELL, EVEN AFTER 50 YEARS, THERE
ARE STILL THINGS ABOUT "SNL"
THAT PEOPLE DON'T KNOW.

563
00:41:07,702 --> 00:41:12,300
SO WE ARE HERE TO ANSWER ANY
QUESTIONS PEOPLE STILL HAVE
ABOUT THE SHOW.

564
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:14,907
DON'T BE SHY.
JUST RAISE YOUR HAND.

565
00:41:14,907 --> 00:41:16,472
YES, QUINTA BRUNSON.

566
00:41:16,472 --> 00:41:19,775
>> HI.
>> HI!
>> HI.

567
00:41:19,775 --> 00:41:21,721
HI

QUINTA BRUNSON HERE.

569
00:41:23,664 --> 00:41:27,903
FIRST OF ALL, I WANT TO SAY, YOU
LADIES LOOK GREAT.
WHAT'S YOUR SECRET?

570
00:41:27,903 --> 00:41:31,525
>> WOW, THANK YOU FOR ASKING
THAT QUESTION WE WROTE.

571
00:41:31,863 --> 00:41:36,125
I'M WEARING A 3D PRINTED MASK OF
MY YOUNGER SELF.

572
00:41:36,125 --> 00:41:38,645
>> AND MY FACE IS ALL NATURAL,

573
00:41:38,645 --> 00:41:41,218
BUT FULL DISCLOSURE, THIS IS THE
BACK OF MY HEAD.

574
00:41:41,218 --> 00:41:44,103
I SLIP MID HAIR AND STARTED
OVER.

575
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:46,990
>> WELL, IT'S WORKING FOR YOU,
BABY GIRL.

576
00:41:46,990 --> 00:41:49,754
ANY WAY, I AM A "SNL" SUPERFAN.

577
00:41:49,754 --> 00:41:52,364
MY QUESTION IS KIND OF A DEEP
CUT.

578
00:41:52,364 --> 00:41:56,646
IN THE MARCH 18th, 1993 GOOD NIGHTS,

579
00:41:56,646 --> 00:41:59,963
TIM MEADOWS WHISPERED
SOMETHING TO MUSICAL GUEST SADE?

580
00:41:59,963 --> 00:42:01,364
WHAT WAS HE SAYING?

581
00:42:01,364 --> 00:42:02,968
>> OH, WOW, LET'S FIND OUT.

582
00:42:02,968 --> 00:42:05,587
TIM, DO YOU REMEMBER WHAT YOU
WERE SAYING?

583
00:42:05,587 --> 00:42:08,803
>> OH, YEAH, WOW.

584
00:42:11,882 --> 00:42:13,563
THANK YOU.

585
00:42:13,563 --> 00:42:16,491
YES, IT WAS MARCH '93.

586
00:42:16,491 --> 00:42:21,328
I'M PRETTY SURE I WAS SAYING
HEY, SADE, YOU WANT TO DRINK
SOME ZIMA WITH ME IN MY DRESSING
ROOM?

587
00:42:21,328 --> 00:42:27,678
WE CAN PLAY MORTAL KOMBAT 1 AND
WATCH THE NEW MENENDEZ TRIAL.

588
00:42:27,828 --> 00:42:29,730
>> THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I
THOUGHT.

589
00:42:29,730 --> 00:42:32,618
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.

590
00:42:33,233 --> 00:42:37,689
>> ALSO, AT WORK BY THE WAY,
SADE ARE STILL TOGETHER.

591
00:42:37,689 --> 00:42:39,677
>> THAT'S AWESOME.
THAT'S AWESOME.

592
00:42:39,677 --> 00:42:41,144
WHO ELSE HAS A QUESTION?

593
00:42:41,144 --> 00:42:42,264
>> I HAVE A QUESTION.

594
00:42:42,264 --> 00:42:45,534
>> OH, HI, RYAN REYNOLDS, HI.

595
00:42:47,139 --> 00:42:50,328
HOW'S IT GOING?
>> GREAT.

596
00:42:50,328 --> 00:42:52,420
WHY, WHAT HAVE YOU HEARD?

597
00:42:58,427 --> 00:43:03,400
MY QUESTION IS YOU KNOW THE
MATERIALS THAT THEY MADE THE CONEHEADS WITH,

598
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:05,471
ARE THOSE
EDIBLE?

599
00:43:05,471 --> 00:43:07,471
>> EDIBLE?
NO, NO.

600
00:43:07,471 --> 00:43:11,818
AND BASED ON THEM BEING MADE IN
1975, I'D ASSUME THEY'RE HIGHLY
TOXIC.

601
00:43:11,818 --> 00:43:15,408
>> OH, OKAY.
SO SOMEBODY HYPOTHETICALLY

602
00:43:15,408 --> 00:43:18,542
TOOK
A COUPLE NIBBLES BACKSTAGE AND GOT EXCITED,

603
00:43:18,542 --> 00:43:20,769
SHOULD THEY GO TO
THE HOSPITAL OR SHOULD THEY --

604
00:43:20,769 --> 00:43:23,192
>> YES, THEY SHOULD GO TO
HOSPITAL RIGHT AWAY.

605
00:43:23,192 --> 00:43:24,405
>> GOOD.
>> GOOD LUCK.

606
00:43:24,405 --> 00:43:26,320
NEXT QUESTION --

607
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:28,505
>> I HAVE A QUESTION.
>> YES?

608
00:43:28,505 --> 00:43:31,285
NATE

609
00:43:31,285 --> 00:43:34,342
>> WHEN I HOSTED THE SHOW, THERE
WAS A WOMAN

610
00:43:34,342 --> 00:43:37,449
WHO PULLED ME BEHIND
A LITTLE CURTAIN AND TOOK MY
PANTS OFF.

611
00:43:37,449 --> 00:43:40,233
DOES SHE WORK HERE?

612
00:43:40,233 --> 00:43:42,720
>> IS SHE A BLOND WOMAN WITH A
STOPWATCH?

613
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:47,700
>> YEAH.
SHE PUT HER ARM AROUND MY WAIST
AND KIND OF SHOOK ME UNTIL MY
SHOES FELL OFF.

614
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:50,017
DID I DREAM THAT OR IS THAT --

615
00:43:50,017 --> 00:43:53,499
>> NO, THAT'S DONNA.
COME OUT HERE, DONNA.

616
00:44:04,501 --> 00:44:06,831
>> DONNA,

617
00:44:06,831 --> 00:44:11,947
DONNA HAS BEEN
DRESSING EVERY HOST SINCE 1997.

618
00:44:11,947 --> 00:44:16,724
SHE HAS SEEN EVERY CELEBRITY
HERE IN THEIR UNDERPANTS.

619
00:44:16,724 --> 00:44:19,671
>> DONNA, I KNOW IT'S HARD TO
PICK, BUT WHO WAS YOUR FAV --

620
00:44:19,671 --> 00:44:22,347
>> JASON MOMOA.

621
00:44:26,335 --> 00:44:29,903
>> OUR NEXT QUESTION WAS
SUBMITTED BY A VIEWER.

622
00:44:29,903 --> 00:44:33,391
LOVED FAN 89 WANTS TO KNOW

623
00:44:33,391 --> 00:44:38,841
WHY AM I SEATED ACROSS THE STREET IN
THE AMERICAN GIRLS STORE?

624
00:44:38,841 --> 00:44:41,830
>> I'M NOT MAD.
I JUST WANT TO KNOW WHY.

625
00:44:41,830 --> 00:44:43,902
LADIES?

626
00:44:47,689 --> 00:44:50,592
SO LOVITZ FAN IS JON LOVITZ.

627
00:44:50,592 --> 00:44:54,656
I KNOW THE SEATING CHART WAS
REALLY HARD TO FIGURE OUT.

628
00:44:54,656 --> 00:44:56,844
YOU WERE GOING TO BE SEATED IN
THE STUDIO,

629
00:44:56,844 --> 00:45:01,597
BUT THEN JULIA
LOUIS-DREYFUS ASKED TO BRING HER
SERVICE DOG.

630
00:45:01,597 --> 00:45:03,273
SORRY

631
00:45:03,273 --> 00:45:07,169
>> YEAH, SORRY.
JON, IT'S A MEDICAL THING.

632
00:45:07,169 --> 00:45:09,142
YOU REALLY NEED THAT DOG, RIGHT,
JULIA?

633
00:45:09,142 --> 00:45:13,912
>> OH, NO, NO, NO.
I'M HERE FOR HIM.
HE IS BLIND.

634
00:45:15,109 --> 00:45:19,403
>> SO RICKY, THE BLOND WOMAN WHO
JUST TALKED,

635
00:45:19,403 --> 00:45:21,420
THAT'S AMY POEHLER.

636
00:45:21,420 --> 00:45:26,023
AND THE OLDER WOMAN NEXT TO HER
IS TINA FEY.

637
00:45:27,025 --> 00:45:31,332
AND THE INTENSE ENERGY THAT
YOU'RE FEELING TO YOUR LEFT

638
00:45:31,332 --> 00:45:34,042
IS ADAM DRIVER.

639
00:45:37,650 --> 00:45:40,498
HE IS AN ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE
ACTOR.

640
00:45:40,498 --> 00:45:45,971
AND RIGHT NOW HE IS ACTING LIKE
HE IS NOT ATTRACTED TO ME.

641
00:45:45,971 --> 00:45:49,268
HOW YOU DOING?
THIS IS MY PUPPY HERE.

642
00:45:49,268 --> 00:45:51,586
YEAH.

643
00:45:51,586 --> 00:45:55,031
>> OKAY.
ALL RIGHT.
LET'S TAKE ANOTHER QUESTION.

644
00:45:55,031 --> 00:45:57,916
YES, CHER, YOU HAVE A QUESTION?

645
00:45:57,916 --> 00:46:00,955
>> NO, I DON'T.

646
00:46:00,955 --> 00:46:04,458

651
00:46:23,665 --> 00:46:27,762
AND I'M KIND OF WONDERING IF
ANYBODY HAS SEEN IT AROUND.

652
00:46:27,762 --> 00:46:32,750
>> A SCARF, YEAH, IN 1998?
WELL, THAT'S A LONG TIME AGO.

653
00:46:32,750 --> 00:46:34,809
>> I DON'T THINK SO.
I'M NOT SURE.

654
00:46:34,809 --> 00:46:37,714
>> LOOK, IT'S SIMPLY NOT HERE,
OKAY?

655
00:46:37,714 --> 00:46:41,247
CAN WE ALL STOP LOOKING?
NEXT QUESTION!

>> WHENEVER WE ASK YOU TO DO A
BIT, YOU ALWAYS SAY YES.

664
00:47:05,486 --> 00:47:07,829
AND THAT'S WHAT MATTERS.

JUST WAY FOR YOU GUYS TO GIVE
AIR TIME TO CELEBRITIES

676
00:47:47,748 --> 00:47:49,834

SHOW.

677
00:47:49,834 --> 00:47:52,470
>> REALLY?
IT DOESN'T SEEM THAT WAY TO ME.

678
00:47:52,470 --> 00:47:56,439
WHAT DO YOU THINK, REVEREND AL
SHARPTON AND RAY ROMANO?

679
00:47:57,490 --> 00:48:02,309
>> IT SEEMS VERY NATURAL TO US.

680
00:48:02,309 --> 00:48:05,426
>> REALLY, DON'T BE SO CYNICAL,
SETH.

681

SHE LIKE TO TRAVEL OR?

686
00:48:16,460 --> 00:48:19,853
>> WE'LL HAVE TO ASK HER.
>> ALL RIGHT.
GOOD TO KNOW.

687
00:48:19,854 --> 00:48:20,890

THANK YOU, GUYS.

690
00:48:27,853 --> 00:48:32,909
MY QUESTION IS, DO YOU KNOW WHY
LORNE CUT "VAMPIRE OFFICE"?

691
00:48:32,909 --> 00:48:35,028
>> WHAT?

692
00:48:35,028 --> 00:48:38,834
>> WELL, IN 2005, I WROTE A
SKETCH CALLED "VAMPIRE OFFICE"

693
00:48:38,834 --> 00:48:42,347
AND IT PLAYED PRETTY WELL AT
DRESS AND IT DIDN'T GET ON AIR.

694
00:48:42,347 --> 00:48:45,658
>> OKAY, I GUESS MAYBE OTHER
SKETCHES DID BETTER?

695
00:48:45,658 --> 00:48:48,694
>> NO.
IT WAS A PRETTY BAD SHOW FRONT
TO BACK.

696
00:48:48,694 --> 00:48:51,898
>> I DON'T KNOW.
>> OKAY, WELL, MAYBE HE JUST
DIDN'T LIKE IT.

697
00:48:51,898 --> 00:48:55,087
>> WELL, DO YOU KNOW IF HE SAW
THE CHANGES I WAS GOING TO MAKE,

698
00:48:55,087 --> 00:48:59,845
BECAUSE I CUT THE B WORD AS
VANESSA COMES IN AS SIMON
COWELL.

699
00:48:59,845 --> 00:49:02,233
>> WAIT, ARE YOU HOLDING THE
SKETCH RIGHT NOW?

700
00:49:02,233 --> 00:49:05,474
YEAH. DO YOU THINK I SHOULD RESIB

00:49:19,175 --> 00:49:22,572
>> OKAY, WE ONLY HAVE TIME FOR
LIKE 100 MORE QUESTIONS.

704
00:49:22,572 --> 00:49:25,228
>> YES, YES.
PEYTON MANNING?

705
00:49:29,546 --> 00:49:31,892
>> IS LORNE GOING TO RETIRE NOW?

706
00:49:31,892 --> 00:49:33,627
>> NO, I DON'T THINK SO.

707
00:49:33,627 --> 00:49:35,107
>> OKAY, THAT'S GREAT NEWS.

708
00:49:35,107 --> 00:49:39,166
LORNE, NEVER RETIRE.
IT'S BRUTAL OUT HERE.

709
00:49:39,166 --> 00:49:43,071
THEY HAVE ME DOING ALL THESE
COMMERCIALS -- INSURANCE, BEER.

710
00:49:43,071 --> 00:49:46,973

00:49:46,973 --> 00:49:48,833
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THE HELL
IT IS.

714
00:49:55,418 --> 00:49:58,699
I HATE BEING RETIRED.
>> OKAY, OKAY.

715
00:49:58,699 --> 00:50:01,058
>> NO, SERIOUSLY, LORNE, GETTING
OLD SUCKS.

716
00:50:01,058 --> 00:50:02,981
YOU FEEL LIKE SUCH A LOSER.

717
00:50:02,981 --> 00:50:05,275
GALIFIANAKIS KNOWS WHAT I'M
TALKING ABOUT.

00:52:12,849 --> 00:52:14,580
AND TOOK THE
CRAZY --

766
00:52:14,580 --> 00:52:15,239
>> RIGHT.

767
00:52:15,239 --> 00:52:19,087
Oh, if these pipes could talk

768
00:52:19,087 --> 00:52:21,931
The stories they would tell

769
00:52:21,931 --> 00:52:23,345
If these pipes could talk

770
00:52:23,345 --> 00:52:27,191
If these pipes could talk

771
00:52:27,191 --> 00:52:31,237
I think they'd sound a little like this

772
00:52:31,756 --> 00:52:33,959
>> YOU'VE GOT TO STOP DOING
THAT.
>> NO PROMISES.

773
00:52:33,959 --> 00:52:36,038
Jump to the '90s, Ana and Molly

774
00:52:36,038 --> 00:52:38,041
Making 'em laugh with Schweddy Balls

775
00:52:38,041 --> 00:52:40,093
On the outside, calm and collected

776
00:52:40,093 --> 00:52:42,059
But that's not how they felt at all

777
00:52:42,060 --> 00:52:44,819
Oh, we were freaked out as hell

778
00:52:44,819 --> 00:52:46,759
¶ WE WANTED TO DIE,

779
00:52:46,759 --> 00:52:48,846
We wished for our own deaths

780
00:52:48,846 --> 00:52:50,818
And we had IBS

781
00:52:50,818 --> 00:52:52,672
>> COME ON, GUYS, WE HAVE
PERSPECTIVE.

782
00:52:52,672 --> 00:52:54,370
WE KNOW THESE ARE CHAMPAGNE
PROBLEMS.

783
00:52:54,370 --> 00:52:56,608
I MEAN, IT'S NOT LIKE WE'RE
WORKING IN A COAL MINE.

784
00:52:56,608 --> 00:52:58,786
>> GOD, NO.
>> BUT HERE'S A SECRET.

785
00:52:58,786 --> 00:53:00,843
¶ IT'S WAY WORSE THAN WORKING IN
A COAL MINE.

786
00:53:00,844 --> 00:53:02,847
It's more dangerous than working in a coal mine

787
00:53:02,847 --> 00:53:04,958
WE WOULD LOVE TO BE WORKING IN A COAL MINE,

788
00:53:04,958 --> 00:53:07,167
JUST LOOK AT THESE
COAL MINERS DRINKING SWEET TEA,

789
00:53:07,167 --> 00:53:09,042
They never had to get notes from Lorne

790
00:53:09,042 --> 00:53:11,159
Sit underneath the bleachers with Lorne

791
00:53:11,159 --> 00:53:13,413
You're proving my point, that sounds good to you?

792
00:53:13,413 --> 00:53:15,413
>> NOW THAT I HEAR IT, I MIGHT
SKIP IT TOO,

793
00:53:15,413 --> 00:53:17,661
BECAUSE IN THE END
YOU HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF
YOURSELF.

794
00:53:17,661 --> 00:53:20,647
A mature decision for our mental health

795
00:53:20,647 --> 00:53:23,485
BUT WHAT IF THEY FORGET ABOUT ME,

796
00:53:23,485 --> 00:53:25,125
Don't forget me

797
00:53:25,125 --> 00:53:29,513
IF I DON'T GO TO THE SHOW,
WILL I DISAPPEAR ¶

798
00:53:29,513 --> 00:53:34,676
Or will I fall to the bottom
of the Best Cast Members of All Time list?

799
00:53:34,676 --> 00:53:35,858
¶ THAT'S YOUR FORTE ¶

800
00:53:35,859 --> 00:53:36,664
WHAT

801
00:53:36,664 --> 00:53:38,170
>> YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M IN.
- SAME.

802
00:53:38,170 --> 00:53:41,463
>> BECAUSE EVERYONE ¶

803
00:53:41,463 --> 00:53:42,470
>> I GET IT NOW!

804
00:53:42,470 --> 00:53:46,847
¶ THAT EVER WORKED AT "SNL" HAD
ANXIETY ¶

805
00:53:46,847 --> 00:53:50,424

AT "SNL" HAD ANXIETY,

808

It's a challenging place, but we love it

809
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:14,218
Stress dreams for the rest of your life

810
00:54:14,451 --> 00:54:17,734
We're like moths to the flame

811
00:54:18,594 --> 00:54:21,112
But it burns so good

812
00:54:30,001 --> 00:54:34,841
>>> LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, MILEY
CYRUS AND BRITTANY HOWARD.

>> WOW.
YOU JUST ASSUME I'M PREGNANT.

908
01:02:56,973 --> 01:02:59,094

OR SHOULD I KEEP HER
IN HERE FOR ANOTHER 3 1/2 YEARS.

917

01:07:42,058 --> 01:07:44,200
HE CAN BE A LITTLE RUDE.

995
01:07:44,200 --> 01:07:47,944
>> YEAH, LIKE A MONTH AGO, HE
ASKED US TO HELP HIM MOVE.

996
01:07:47,944 --> 01:07:49,615
AND WE'RE LIKE SURE, OF COURSE.

997
01:07:49,615 --> 01:07:51,896
HELP YOU MOVE.
HAVE A LITTLE DINNER, WHATEVER.

998
01:07:51,896 --> 01:07:54,722
>> SO WE GET THERE.
LORNE OPENS THE DOOR,

999
01:07:54,722 --> 01:07:57,203
AND HE IS
LIKE OH, YOU TWO.

1000
01:07:57,203 --> 01:07:59,072
AND WE'RE LIKE WHAT?

1001
01:07:59,072 --> 01:08:01,944
>> YOU INVITED US.
WE DON'T HAVE TO BE HERE.

1002
01:08:01,944 --> 01:08:05,790
>> SO WE LOOK AROUND.
NOTHING IS PACKED.
>> NOTHING IS PACKED.

1003
01:08:05,790 --> 01:08:09,425
>> YOU HAVEN'T EVEN STARTED YET?

1004
01:08:09,425 --> 01:08:13,241
AND THEN HE STARTS POINTING AT
PAINTINGS AND SAYING

1005
01:08:13,241 --> 01:08:17,245
THIS IS
FROM STEVE, THIS IS FROM PAUL,
THIS IS FROM MICK.

1006
01:08:17,245 --> 01:08:20,088
>> AND DOES HE MEAN MICK JAGGER?
>> JUST TO SAY IT.

1007
01:08:20,088 --> 01:08:22,159
SAY

1008
01:08:22,159 --> 01:08:26,159
>> I'M SORRY, YOU GUYS HAVE TO
SPEAK UP.
I DON'T THINK ANYBODY CAN HEAR
YOU.

1009
01:08:26,159 --> 01:08:29,607
BUT ALSO, IT DOES SOUND LIKE
MAYBE LORNE CAN BE A LITTLE
DIFFICULT.

1010
01:08:29,607 --> 01:08:30,754
>> NO.
>> NO, NO.
NO.

1011
01:08:30,754 --> 01:08:32,558
>> HE IS OUR FRIEND.
HE IS OUR BEST FRIEND.

1012
01:08:32,558 --> 01:08:36,650
>> HE IS EASY-BREEZY CRAZY TIME,
ALL OF IT.

1013
01:08:36,921 --> 01:08:39,965
I WILL SAY

1014
01:08:39,965 --> 01:08:43,513
HE CAN BE KIND OF
LIKE INCONSIDERATE.

1015
01:08:43,513 --> 01:08:47,810
LIKE WE'RE PACKING HIS STUFF FOR
HOURS, AND HE'S GONE.

1016
01:08:47,810 --> 01:08:52,880
AND HE COMES BACK, AND OH, HEY,

1017
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:57,623
AND HE GOES THERE IS A STARBUCKS

1018
01:08:57,623 --> 01:09:00,080
BUT YOU HAVE TO BUY SOMETHING

1019
01:09:00,080 --> 01:09:02,795

>> AGAIN, YOU GUYS HAVE TO SPEAK
UP.

1023
01:09:10,668 --> 01:09:15,022
BUT IT SEEMS LIKE MAYBE YOU GUYS
AREN'T THAT GOOD A FRIENDS WITH
HIM.

1024
01:09:15,022 --> 01:09:16,853
>> OH, NO, NO, NO.

1025
01:09:16,853 --> 01:09:18,430
>> HE IS OUR PERSON.
HE IS OUR PERSON.

1031
01:09:38,284 --> 01:09:43,764
AND HE GOES, BY THE WAY YOU TWO
LOOK, I DON'T THINK YOU NEED
HELP FINDING FOOD.

1032

YOU DIDN'T ASK ME HOW MY DAY WAS
OR NOTICE MY HAIRCUT.

1038

>> YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW MUCH
PRESSURE I'M UNDER.

1039

DEEPLY DYSFUNCTIONAL
RELATIONSHIP WITH HIM.

1043
01:10:18,485 --> 01:10:19,996
>> NO.

01:11:51,038 --> 01:11:54,221
I WAS ON
PERFORMANCE-ENHANCING DRUGS.

1068
01:11:54,221 --> 01:11:57,014
IT'S WHAT WE CALL AN 88-SHAKER,

1069
01:11:57,014 --> 01:12:01,447
QUAALUDES, COCAINE, AND
NIGHTTIME THERA FLU.

1070
01:12:01,447 --> 01:12:04,066
ALL RIGHT.
NUMBER 10.

1071
01:12:04,130 --> 01:12:07,474
HE'S ONE OF THE ALL-TIME GREATS,

1072
01:12:07,474 --> 01:12:10,456
MR. COLIN

1073
01:12:10,456 --> 01:12:12,296
QUINN.

1074
01:12:12,296 --> 01:12:15,401
>> OKAY, OKAY.

1075
01:12:16,304 --> 01:12:19,884
>> I HAD YOU FOR A SECOND.
DON'T WORRY.

1076
01:12:19,884 --> 01:12:23,130
NUMBERS 9, 8, AND 7, OKAY?

1077
01:12:23,130 --> 01:12:24,871
HEADS UP,

1078
01:12:25,603 --> 01:12:28,267
KEVIN NEALON.
COME ON!

1079
01:12:28,830 --> 01:12:31,487
DENNIS MILLER,

1080
01:12:31,870 --> 01:12:34,678
AND SETH MEYERS.

1081
01:12:35,805 --> 01:12:41,131
I JUST WISH WE HAD THE TIME
TONIGHT TO SAY SOMETHING NICE
ABOUT ANY OF THEM.

1082
01:12:41,131 --> 01:12:44,059
>> WE ACTUALLY DO PROBABLY HAVE
ENOUGH TIME.

1083
01:12:44,059 --> 01:12:46,682
>> WE'RE RIGHT HERE AT 6:00 NOW.
OKAY.

1084
01:12:46,682 --> 01:12:49,294
COLIN, THIS COULD BE YOU, HUH?

1085
01:12:49,294 --> 01:12:51,242
>> IS IT?

1086
01:12:51,513 --> 01:12:53,549
>> NO, IT IS NOT.

1087
01:12:53,549 --> 01:12:56,925
THE NEXT TWO ARE CONTROVERSIAL.
THIS WAS TOUGH.

1088
01:12:56,925 --> 01:13:02,317
BUT I'M GOING TO PUT TINA AND AMY

1089
01:13:02,317 --> 01:13:06,301
JUST AHEAD OF TINA AND
JIMMY.

1090
01:13:06,673 --> 01:13:09,128
>> SORRY, JIMMY, I'M SORRY.

1091
01:13:09,128 --> 01:13:11,523
AND CONGRATULATIONS, TINA.

1092
01:13:11,523 --> 01:13:14,595
IT WAS CLOSE, BUT I CHECKED ONLINE,

1093
01:13:14,595 --> 01:13:18,512
AND GIRL ON GIRL IS
STILL VERY, VERY POPULAR.

1094
01:13:18,630 --> 01:13:24,339
NEXT UP, CORNELIUS CRANE CHASE.

1095
01:13:24,339 --> 01:13:28,903
WHO WE'VE ALL COME TO KNOW AS
CONNIE.

1096
01:13:28,903 --> 01:13:33,494
LET'S FACE IT, WEEKEND UPDATES
SIMPLY WOULD NOT EXIST WITHOUT
HIM.

1097
01:13:33,494 --> 01:13:37,373
SO IT WOULD BE WRONG TO HAVE HIM
LISTED AT ANYWHERE

1098
01:13:37,373 --> 01:13:39,379
BUT NUMBER
FOUR.

1099
01:13:41,880 --> 01:13:44,087
NUMBER THREE,

1100
01:13:44,087 --> 01:13:48,341
JANE CURTAIN AND DANNY ACKROYD.

1101
01:13:49,559 --> 01:13:52,700
A TRUE STORY, I WAS THE FIRST

1102
01:13:52,700 --> 01:13:55,383
TO CALL JANE AN IGNORANT SLUT.

1103
01:13:55,383 --> 01:13:57,385
BACKSTAGE.

1104
01:13:57,385 --> 01:14:01,542
DANNY HAD THE BRILLIANT IDEA TO
SAY IT ON CAMERA,

1105
01:14:01,542 --> 01:14:05,378
AND REALLY,
REALLY MEAN IT.

1106
01:14:05,693 --> 01:14:10,428
NUMBER TWO IS NORM McDONALD.

1107
01:14:14,534 --> 01:14:16,299
HE MAY HAVE BEEN THE BEST EVER,

1108
01:14:16,299 --> 01:14:19,539
BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY, HE MADE ME, FOR ONE,

1109
01:14:19,539 --> 01:14:24,145
ASK THE QUESTION OF MYSELF

1110
01:14:24,524 --> 01:14:29,009
COULD O.J. POSSIBLY HAVE
DONE IT?

1111
01:14:40,459 --> 01:14:43,484
SO THAT BRINGS US TO NUMBER ONE.
COLIN?

1112
01:14:43,484 --> 01:14:46,219
GOT A GOOD FEELING ABOUT THIS.

1113
01:14:46,219 --> 01:14:48,967
OKAY. NUMBER ONE IS FUNNY,

1114
01:14:48,967 --> 01:14:51,707
GOT A GREAT SMILE,

1115
01:14:52,284 --> 01:14:57,070
AND HE IS CURRENTLY
SLEEPING EVERY KIND OF WAY WITH
THE LOVELY ACTRESS SCARLETT
JOHANSSON.

1116
01:14:57,070 --> 01:14:58,693
OF COURSE I'M TALKING ABOUT

1117
01:14:58,693 --> 01:15:01,946
MY BROTHER, BRIAN

1118
01:15:03,388 --> 01:15:05,672
>> WHAT?
>> YES.

1119
01:15:05,672 --> 01:15:10,744
>> I'M TOLD A VERY, VERY
CONSIDERATE LOVER.

1120
01:15:10,744 --> 01:15:12,944
I COULDN'T BE HAPPIER TO BE
HERE.

1121
01:15:12,944 --> 01:15:14,988
>> BILL MURRAY, EVERYBODY.

1122
01:15:14,988 --> 01:15:19,777
I'M MICHAEL CHE.
GOOD NIGHT!

1123
01:15:26,047 --> 01:15:28,046
PENTAGON

1124
01:15:28,046 --> 01:15:29,047
THANK

1125
01:15:29,047 --> 01:15:32,204
FAIRFAX
U.S. SPACE FORCE.

1126
01:15:32,204 --> 01:15:34,642
THIS IS DR. TYLER FROM SETI.

1127
01:15:34,642 --> 01:15:38,214
>> WE ARE EAGER TO TALK TO YOU
AS YOU HAVE ALL EXPERIENCE

1128
01:15:38,214 --> 01:15:40,988
A VERIFIED ALIEN ABDUCTION.

1129
01:15:40,988 --> 01:15:43,695
>> THIS IS WILD.

1130
01:15:43,695 --> 01:15:47,813
ONE MINUTE WE'RE THREE FRIENDS
SLAMMING MILLER TALL BOYS BEHIND
THE DOLLAR TREE,

1131
01:15:47,813 --> 01:15:49,743
NOW WE'RE
SITTING AT THE PENTAGON.

1132
01:15:49,743 --> 01:15:52,679
>> HEY, I'VE BEEN MEANING TO ASK

1133
01:15:52,679 --> 01:15:56,149
LIKE WHY DO YOU CALL IT THE PENTAGON

1134
01:15:56,149 --> 01:15:59,304
WHEN IT'S ONLY GOT FIVE
SIDES?

1135
01:15:59,304 --> 01:16:03,793
>> BECAUSE A SHAPE WITH FIVE
SIDES IS CALLED A PENTAGON.

1136
01:16:03,793 --> 01:16:07,246
>> I DON'T THINK THAT'S RIGHT.

1137
01:16:07,246 --> 01:16:08,733
>> WE'LL LOOK INTO IT.

1138
01:16:08,733 --> 01:16:12,005
NOW LET'S START WITH HOW YOU
WERE ALL BROUGHT ABOARD THE
SPACECRAFT.

1139
01:16:12,005 --> 01:16:16,171
>> WELL, THIS BEAM OF LIGHT
APPEARED FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE
SHIP.

1140
01:16:16,171 --> 01:16:19,271
FLOATED ME UP LIKE A SAW PAN
BECKONING ME.

1141
01:16:19,271 --> 01:16:20,803
>> SAME-SAME,

1142
01:16:20,803 --> 01:16:25,600
AND WE MET THESE
TWO BEAUTIFUL GLOWING ALIENS

1143
01:16:25,600 --> 01:16:28,901
WHO TOOK OUR HANDS AND SAID
WELCOME.

1144
01:16:28,901 --> 01:16:32,356
I'VE NEVER FELT SO SAFE.

1145
01:16:32,356 --> 01:16:35,520
>> AND YOU, MS. RAFFERTY?

1146
01:16:35,520 --> 01:16:38,987
>> YEAH, A LITTLE DIFFERENT FOR
ME.

1147
01:16:38,987 --> 01:16:42,001
I WAS LESS CRADLED BY LIGHT

1148
01:16:42,001 --> 01:16:45,206
AND MORE GRABBED BY A GIANT RUSTY CLAW

1149
01:16:45,206 --> 01:16:48,015
WHICH YANKED ME RIGHT OUT
OF MY SLACKS.

1150
01:16:48,015 --> 01:16:50,188
SO I'M PANTSLESS, RIGHT?

1151
01:16:50,188 --> 01:16:54,014
I'M FOLDED IN HALF LIKE A
WALLET.
NIPS

1152
01:16:54,014 --> 01:16:56,128
I'M GETTING WINCHED SKYWARD

1153
01:16:56,128 --> 01:17:00,262
WITH MY VAGITA AND MY TRAGEDY
FLAPPING IN BREEZE

1154
01:17:00,262 --> 01:17:02,922
AND AYE TOSSED INTO THE BOTTOM OF
THE SHIP.

1155
01:17:02,922 --> 01:17:07,893
I SEE MY OLD PALS THE GRAY
ALIENS WITH THE BIG DUMB EYES.

1156
01:17:07,893 --> 01:17:12,729
>> MRS. RAFFERTY, I'M TOLD THIS
IS YOUR FIFTH TIME BEING
ABDUCTED BY THESE GRAY ALIENS?

1157
01:17:12,729 --> 01:17:17,500
>> YEAH.
ONLY OTHER PLACE I'VE BEEN
PANTSLESS FIVE TIMES IS

1158
01:17:17,500 --> 01:17:19,535
SIX
FLAGS.

1159
01:17:19,535 --> 01:17:21,998
>> OKAY, WELL, LET'S MOVE PAST
THAT.

1160
01:17:21,998 --> 01:17:24,741
NOW WHAT HAPPENED NEXT IN THE
UPPER PART OF THE SHIP?

1161
01:17:24,741 --> 01:17:28,302
>> WELL, THE SMART ALIENS BATHED
US IN THIS GLOWING LIQUID

1162
01:17:28,302 --> 01:17:31,981
THAT ERASED ALL MY PAIN.
MY BAD KNEE DIDN'T EVEN HURT.

1163
01:17:31,981 --> 01:17:35,752
I BUSTED IT A FEW YEARS BACK
PLAYING PAINT BALL.

1164
01:17:35,949 --> 01:17:38,553
COMPETITIVE.

1165
01:17:40,203 --> 01:17:43,776
>> I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU WINKED
AT ME AFTER SAYING THAT,

1166
01:17:43,776 --> 01:17:48,071
BUT
LET'S CONTINUE.
WERE YOU ALSO BATHED IN THIS
LIGHT, SIR?

1167
01:17:48,071 --> 01:17:50,301
>> HUH, YES, MA'AM.

1168
01:17:50,301 --> 01:17:53,627
IT FELT BETTER THAN ANY DRUG,

1169
01:17:53,627 --> 01:17:57,357
INCLUDING THE ONES I'M ON RIGHT
NOW.

1170
01:17:57,542 --> 01:17:59,849
>> NOW THAT REALLY TWEAKS MY CHEEKS

1171
01:17:59,849 --> 01:18:04,526
BECAUSE DOWN IN STEERAGE,
THE MOOD WAS TENSE.

1172
01:18:04,526 --> 01:18:07,384
>> STEERAGE, WHAT DO YOU THINK
COULD HAVE CAUSED THIS REACTION?

1173
01:18:07,384 --> 01:18:09,638
>> WELL, BETWEEN YOU, ME AND
JESUS C.,

1174
01:18:09,638 --> 01:18:12,967
I THINK IT HAD THE
STATE OF MY DOWN THERE HAIR.

1175
01:18:12,967 --> 01:18:16,414
BECAUSE REMEMBER, I'M DONALD
DUCKING IT, OKAY?

1176
01:18:16,414 --> 01:18:18,482
SHIRT, NO PANTS.

1177
01:18:18,482 --> 01:18:22,222
SO I'M POKE KAY BOWL AND MY
SMOKY HOLE ARE OUT.

1178
01:18:22,222 --> 01:18:27,354
AND PUBICALLY SPEAKING, NATURE
HAS RECLAIMED THE EARTH.

1179
01:18:27,354 --> 01:18:30,761
LAST TIME I HAD A BRAZILIAN DOWN
THERE WAS 2002.

1180
01:18:30,761 --> 01:18:33,963
HIS NAME WAS DIEGO, AND HE GOT
STREP THROAT.

1181
01:18:35,094 --> 01:18:39,819
WHO MOWS THE LAWN IN WINTER, AM
I RIGHT?

1182
01:18:40,020 --> 01:18:41,664
>> AMEN.

1183
01:18:41,664 --> 01:18:45,409
>> NOT SAY AMEN TO THAT COUNTRY.

1184
01:18:45,409 --> 01:18:47,761
>> MRS. REPORTY, I'M FAILING TO SEE

1185
01:18:47,761 --> 01:18:52,226
WHAT YOUR UNKEMPT PRIVATE
AREA HAS TO DO WITH THE ALIENS'
DEMEANOR.

1186
01:18:52,226 --> 01:18:56,344
>> OKAY, MY THEORY IS THEY
THOUGHT IT WAS AN ANIMAL.

1187
01:18:56,345 --> 01:18:59,051
BECAUSE

1188
01:18:59,051 --> 01:19:02,301
FIRST, THEY DIDN'T KNOW IF IT
WAS FRIENDLY.

1189
01:19:02,301 --> 01:19:07,150
SO THEY'RE CAUTIOUS.
THEY'RE GOING UP THE CABINET,
AND THEY'RE GOING --

1190
01:19:07,548 --> 01:19:11,069
AND THEN,
THEN, THE ALPHA COMES IN,

1191
01:19:11,069 --> 01:19:12,864
AND HE
CHALLENGES IT, RIGHT.

1192
01:19:12,864 --> 01:19:14,867
HE GOES LIKE THIS.

1193
01:19:19,110 --> 01:19:21,807
SO HE GIVES A THUMBS-UP LIKE

1194
01:19:21,807 --> 01:19:23,513
WE'RE GOOD, IT'S TAME.

1195
01:19:23,513 --> 01:19:25,667
AND WHOA, IT'S PLAY TIME.

1196
01:19:25,668 --> 01:19:27,585
AND ONE OF THEM
SORRY

1197
01:19:27,585 --> 01:19:30,197
COMES UP UNDER IT,

1198
01:19:30,830 --> 01:19:33,435
PUTS IT ON LIKE A WIG,

1199
01:19:33,435 --> 01:19:36,504
AND HE'S LIKE DOING PROP COMEDY,

1200
01:19:36,504 --> 01:19:40,121
AND ANOTHER ONE, HE IS SO EXCITED,

1201
01:19:40,121 --> 01:19:42,717
HE IS WRESTLING WITH IT,

1202
01:19:42,717 --> 01:19:46,681
LIKE IT'S HIS BROTHER, PULLING ME ALL
AROUND THE ROOM.

1203
01:19:46,681 --> 01:19:50,960
SO I LOOK DOWN.
I SEE A GUY BETWEEN MY LEGS WITH
A SMILE ON HIS FACE.

1204
01:19:50,960 --> 01:19:54,963
I DON'T KNOW.
FIRST TIME FOR EVERYTHING.

1205
01:19:56,442 --> 01:19:57,407
>> AMEN.

1206
01:19:57,407 --> 01:20:00,918
>> OKAY, AGAIN, NOT A THING TO
SAY AMEN TO.

1207
01:20:00,918 --> 01:20:05,524
>> AND THIS GOES ON ABOUT 15
MINUTES UNTIL WHO COMES TO THE DOOR

1208
01:20:05,524 --> 01:20:08,386
BUT MY FRIGGING MOTHER,
COLLEEN SR.

1209
01:20:08,386 --> 01:20:12,041
>> YES.
WE ACTUALLY HAD SOME QUESTIONS
FOR HER AS WELL.

1210
01:20:12,042 --> 01:20:15,202
>> I'M HERE, I'M HERE, I'M HERE.

1211
01:20:24,076 --> 01:20:28,189
>> SORRY, SORRY, MY BATHROOM
BREAK TOOK LONGER THAN I
THOUGHT.

1212
01:20:28,189 --> 01:20:31,388
MY NUMBER ONE TURNED INTO A
NUMBER THREE.

1213
01:20:33,066 --> 01:20:36,152
>> MEGA MILL OF ALERT.

1214
01:20:36,152 --> 01:20:37,837
>> NOT.

1215
01:20:37,837 --> 01:20:41,292
NOW MRS. RAFFERTY, YOU HAD BEEN
ABDUCTED EARLIER THAT SAME
EVENING?

1216
01:20:41,292 --> 01:20:46,980
>> YEP.
US RAFFERTY GALS, WE ALWAYS
ATTRACTED THE FREAKS.

1217
01:20:46,980 --> 01:20:50,169
FOR YEARS I THOUGHT COLLEEN'S
FATHER WAS PART ALIEN,

1218
01:20:50,244 --> 01:20:53,517
BUT IT
TURNS OUT HE WAS JUST
UNCIRCUMCISED.

1219
01:20:59,238 --> 01:21:00,420
>> AMEN.

1220
01:21:00,420 --> 01:21:04,627
>> PLEASE, STOP.
STOP.

1221
01:21:04,627 --> 01:21:09,560
>> ANY WAY, I STILL HAD MY PANTS
ON WHEN THEY TOOK ME,

1222
01:21:09,560 --> 01:21:12,882
BUT THAT
WAS GOOD BECAUSE MUCH LIKE HER,

1223
01:21:12,882 --> 01:21:16,845
I GOT A INTO THE WOODS
SITUATION.

1224
01:21:16,922 --> 01:21:19,381
MY EX USED TO SAY

1225
01:21:19,381 --> 01:21:23,441
THAT IT WAS LIKE TRYING TO HACK HIS WAY
THROUGH THE BLACK FOREST.

1226
01:21:23,441 --> 01:21:24,616
>> OKAY.
>> OKAY.

1227
01:21:24,616 --> 01:21:27,304
>> I FEEL LIKE WE'RE OFF TRACK.

1228
01:21:27,304 --> 01:21:30,471
YOU SAID THAT AFTER ARRIVING ON THE SHIP,

1229
01:21:30,471 --> 01:21:34,692
THE ALIENS LOST
INTEREST AND, QUOTE, STUCK YOU
IN A CLOSET?

1230
01:21:34,692 --> 01:21:37,151
>> YEAH, YES.
CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT?

1231
01:21:37,151 --> 01:21:41,798
I MEAN, HEY, I'M USED TO BEING
STUFFED INTO THOSE CLOSETS,

1232
01:21:41,798 --> 01:21:45,617
BUT
IT'S USUALLY WHEN THE GUY'S WIFE
COMES HOME LATER

1233
01:21:45,617 --> 01:21:48,035
OR EARLIER OR
WHATEVER.

1234
01:21:48,036 --> 01:21:50,890
ANYWAY

1235
01:21:51,279 --> 01:21:54,810
SO ALL OF THE SUDDEN I HEAR THIS
SCREAMING, THIS ONE.

1236
01:21:54,810 --> 01:21:58,909
AND SO I JUST KIND OF -- JUST
KIND OF BUST OUT OF THAT --

1237
01:21:58,909 --> 01:22:01,029
FU

1238
01:22:01,029 --> 01:22:04,944
I
JUST BUST OUT, AND I JUST KICKED
THOSE LITTLE --

1239
01:22:05,076 --> 01:22:07,249
I JUST KICKED
THOSE LITTLE   P ERVS AWAY.

1240
01:22:07,249 --> 01:22:09,693
>> WOW, YOU ARE A GOOD MAMA.

1241
01:22:09,693 --> 01:22:15,945
>> YEAH, WELL, A GOOD MOTHER CAN
ALSO BE A GAD GIRL.

1242
01:22:22,458 --> 01:22:24,171
WHAT'S YOUR NAME, MUSTACHE?

1243
01:22:24,171 --> 01:22:27,878
>> OKAY, CAN WE NOT DO ANY OF
THAT RIGHT NOW, PLEASE?

1244
01:22:27,878 --> 01:22:32,001
HOW DID YOU ALL EXIT THE
SPACECRAFT?

1245
01:22:32,001 --> 01:22:35,712
>> THAT SAME SOFT LIGHT PICKED
ME UP AND PLACED ME BACK IN MY
BED.

1246
01:22:35,712 --> 01:22:39,905
>> ME TOO.
THAT LIGHT EVEN TUCKED ME IN,

1247
01:22:39,905 --> 01:22:42,959
WHICH WAS SO THOUGHTFUL OF IT.

1248
01:22:42,959 --> 01:22:46,624
>> AND HOW DID YOU TWO DEPART
THE SPACECRAFT?

1249
01:22:46,624 --> 01:22:49,445
>> WELL, IN THE PAST I'VE JUST
BEEN PUSHED OUT OF A HATCH,

1250
01:22:49,445 --> 01:22:52,345
BUT
THIS TIME THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED
TOO.

1251
01:22:54,688 --> 01:22:57,912
>> YEAH, BUT MY PANTS GOT
SNAGGED ON A PIECE OF METAL,

1252
01:22:57,912 --> 01:22:59,845
SO
THEY'RE GONE.

1253
01:22:59,845 --> 01:23:03,629
AND THEN AS FOR UNDERWEAR,
UNDERWEAR WISE,

1254
01:23:03,629 --> 01:23:06,551
THIS DEVIL WEARS
NADA.

1255
01:23:10,586 --> 01:23:15,272
>> BASICALLY, WE KIND OF IT WAS
A FREE-FALL FOR 40 FEET

1256
01:23:15,272 --> 01:23:18,645
WITH OUR
CROCKETT'S AND OUR PARAPETS ON
FULL DISPLAY.

1257
01:23:18,645 --> 01:23:20,694
>> WE CRASHED THROUGH A CEILING.

1258
01:23:20,694 --> 01:23:24,548
WE LAND ASS UP ON TOP OF PHIL
McDERMOTT.

1259
01:23:24,548 --> 01:23:27,221
>> AND WHO IS PHIL McDERMOTT?

1260
01:23:27,221 --> 01:23:29,927
>> HE IS A GENTLEMAN WHOSE
FAMILY I BET WISHED

1261
01:23:29,927 --> 01:23:33,407
THEY WENT
WITH THE CLOSED CASSETTE
FUNERAL.

1262
01:23:35,732 --> 01:23:38,617
>> NOT THE WORST THING MY MOM
AND I HAVE DONE IN A CHURCH.

1263
01:23:38,617 --> 01:23:42,607
>> PLEASE, LET'S NOT FINISH THAT
STORY AT ALL.

1264
01:23:42,607 --> 01:23:46,082
THANK YOU FOR YOUR CANDOR.
WE'RE GOING TO TAKE YOU FOR SOME
PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTS NOW.

1265
01:23:46,082 --> 01:23:48,890

TROUBLE.

Stagehand

1267
01:24:05,481 --> 01:24:08,028
>> IT WAS EARLY, ONLY 50 BUCKS.

1268
01:24:08,028 --> 01:24:10,932
>> YOUNG MAN.
>> OH MY GOD, LARAINE NEWMAN.

1269
01:24:10,932 --> 01:24:14,259
>> WOULD YOU MIND KEEPING THE

LONGER?

1270

STARTED.

1281
01:24:56,343 --> 01:25:00,814
HEY, CHAD, CHAD, DO YOU THINK
MAYBE YOU COULD TAKE A
FIVE-MINUTE BREAK?

1282
01:25:00,814 --> 01:25:03,651
I WAS HOPING TO HAVE A QUIET
MOMENT IN HERE.

1283
01:25:03,651 --> 01:25:05,252
>> OKAY.

1284

>> ACTUALLY, WOULD YOU JOIN ME.

1285
01:25:08,389 --> 01:25:11,531
IT MIGHT BE NICE TO HAVE SOME
COMPANY.

I HAD AMBITION.

1291
01:25:28,692 --> 01:25:32,243
WE ALL DID, BUT GOD, WE WERE
TERRIFIED.

1292
01:25:32,243 --> 01:25:35,400
I THINK THAT'S WHY WE CLUNG TO
EACH OTHER LIKE WE DID,

1293
01:25:35,400 --> 01:25:39,329
WHICH OF
COURSE CREATED ITS OWN PROBLEMS
WITH THE PARTYING AND SEX.
