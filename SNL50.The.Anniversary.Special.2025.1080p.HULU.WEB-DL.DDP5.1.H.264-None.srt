>>> GOOD EVENING,

52
00:05:56,549 --> 00:06:01,780
AND WELCOME TO THE 50th ANNIVERSARY OF
SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE.

53
00:06:02,134 --> 00:06:07,274
I'M STEVE MARTIN, "SATURDAY
NIGHT LIVE'S" NEWEST DIVERSITY
HIRE.

54
00:06:07,274 --> 00:06:09,895
WHAT A THRILL IT IS TO BE HERE.

55
00:06:09,895 --> 00:06:14,094
WHEN I HEARD "SNL" WANTED TO DO
AN ANNIVERSARY SPECIAL,

56
00:06:14,094 --> 00:06:17,270
I LITERALLY WANTED
TO LEAP IN THE AIR.

57
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:20,398
AND THE ONLY REASON I DIDN'T IS
BECAUSE AT THE TIME,

58
00:06:20,398 --> 00:06:23,354
I WAS
WEARING A SHORT SKIRT WITH NO
UNDERWEAR.

59
00:06:23,354 --> 00:06:26,219
I CAN'T BELIEVE

60
00:06:28,039 --> 00:06:31,037
I CAN'T BELIEVE I MADE IT HERE IN TIME.

61
00:06:31,037 --> 00:06:34,644
IT WAS ONLY A FEW DAYS AGO THAT
LORNE TOLD ME I WAS DOING THE MONOLOGUE,

62
00:06:34,746 --> 00:06:39,569
AND I WAS ACTUALLY
VACATIONING ON A FRIEND'S BOAT
DOWN IN THE GULF OF STEVE
MARTIN.

63
00:06:39,569 --> 00:06:42,117
BUT FINALLY,

64
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:47,347
IT TOOK ME A WHILE
TO GET HERE, BUT I DID.

65
00:06:47,347 --> 00:06:52,147
SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE, AS YOU
KNOW, TURNED 50 YEARS OLD THIS YEAR,

66
00:06:52,147 --> 00:06:55,779
AND I TURNED 79.

67
00:06:59,051 --> 00:07:03,188
BUT I FEEL LIKE I'M 65,

68
00:07:03,188 --> 00:07:05,918
WHICH IS ALSO NOT GOOD.

69
00:07:09,281 --> 00:07:12,951
NOW SERIOUSLY, I DO NOT MIND
GETTING OLDER.

70
00:07:12,951 --> 00:07:17,161
DO YOU THINK THESE HEARING AIDS
MAKE MY ASS LOOK SMALLER?
I DO.

71
00:07:19,445 --> 00:07:21,865
I'M STILL LEARNING ABOUT LIFE.

72
00:07:21,865 --> 00:07:25,161
ACTUALLY, MY WIFE, WHO IS A VERY
SMART, WISE PERSON,

73
00:07:25,161 --> 00:07:26,530
TAUGHT ME
SOMETHING THE OTHER DAY.

74
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:28,063
SHE SAT ME DOWN, AND SHE SAID,

75
00:07:28,063 --> 00:07:32,987
"STEVE, YOU KNOW, BABIES DON'T"
GET SARCASM."

76
00:07:36,109 --> 00:07:41,179
AND I REALIZED I'D BEEN WASTING
MY TIME GOING UP TO STROLLERS IN THE STREET

77
00:07:41,179 --> 00:07:44,329
SAYING, "OH, WHAT A
CUTE BABY!"

78
00:07:48,933 --> 00:07:52,445
NOW, A FUN FACT.

79
00:07:52,445 --> 00:07:56,792
A PERSON BORN DURING FIRST
SEASON OF "SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE"

80
00:07:56,792 --> 00:08:01,298
COULD TODAY BE EASILY DEAD OF
NATURAL CAUSES.

81
00:08:04,701 --> 00:08:07,876
NOW YOU'RE GOING TO SEE A LOT OF
FAMILIAR THINGS TONIGHT.

82
00:08:07,876 --> 00:08:11,122
MUSICAL GUESTS, SKETCHES, CAMEO
APPEARANCES, THE NEWS.

83
00:08:11,122 --> 00:08:13,396
AND THIS IS THE MONOLOGUE.

84
00:08:13,396 --> 00:08:16,960
TRADITIONALLY, THE WEAKEST PART
OF THE SHOW.

85
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:21,137
YES, THE MONOLOGUE IS LIKE A
RENT-CONTROLLED TENANT.

86
00:08:21,137 --> 00:08:25,244
IT'S NOT GOING ANYWHERE, EVEN
THOUGH IT STINKS.

87
00:08:25,244 --> 00:08:28,928
AND THERE ARE SO MANY MEMBERS OF
THE "SNL" FAMILY HERE TONIGHT.

88
00:08:28,928 --> 00:08:31,646
THE GREAT BILL MURRAY IS HERE.

89
00:08:34,565 --> 00:08:38,180
WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE BILL
WOULD BE HERE TONIGHT

90
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:40,788
SO WE
DIDN'T INVITE HIM.

91
00:08:42,988 --> 00:08:46,238
AND DAVID LETTERMAN IS HERE.

92
00:08:50,067 --> 00:08:54,302
DAVE, THANKS FOR LEAVING THE
SHEEP AT HOME.

93
00:08:56,378 --> 00:09:00,946
AND WE CAN'T FORGET THE WRITERS
WHO HAVE ALWAYS BEEN

94
00:09:00,946 --> 00:09:03,630
THE HEART
AND SOUL OF "SNL."

95
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:05,908
IN FACT, LET'S PLEASE HAVE THE
GREAT WRITERS

96
00:09:05,908 --> 00:09:10,726
FROM THE PAST 50
YEARS STAND UP AND TAKE A BOW.

97
00:09:19,179 --> 00:09:22,008
BY THE WAY, THAT TRIBUTE TO THE WRITERS

98
00:09:22,008 --> 00:09:24,850
WAS WRITTEN BY AI.

99
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:27,583
OH MY GOD!

100
00:09:28,358 --> 00:09:31,209
JOHN MULANEY!
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE GOING TO
BE HERE.

101
00:09:31,209 --> 00:09:33,678
>> YOU WOULD IF YOU'D EVER COME
TO REHEARSAL.

102
00:09:33,678 --> 00:09:36,510
BY THE WAY, CONGRATULATIONS ON

00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:39,542
>> GRAMMY NOMINATION.
>> NOPE.

106
00:09:39,542 --> 00:09:40,601
>> GOLDEN GLOBE WIN?
>> NOPE.

107
00:09:40,601 --> 00:09:42,882
>> GOLDEN GLOBE NOMINATION?
>> YES, SIR, AND THANK YOU.

108
00:09:42,882 --> 00:09:46,004
>> YOU KNOW, WE WRITERS REALLY
APPRECIATED THAT TRIBUTE,

109
00:09:46,004 --> 00:09:49,356
BUT I
BELIEVE THE HEART AND SOUL OF
THIS SHOW

110
00:09:49,356 --> 00:09:51,826
IS THE CELEBRITY
HOSTS.

111
00:09:51,826 --> 00:09:54,511
MANY OF WHOM ARE IN THIS ROOM
TONIGHT.

112
00:09:54,511 --> 00:09:59,163
YOU KNOW, AS I LOOK AROUND, I
SEE SOME OF THE MOST DIFFICULT PEOPLE

113
00:09:59,163 --> 00:10:03,005
I HAVE EVER MET IN MY
ENTIRE LIFE.

114
00:10:03,005 --> 00:10:08,111
OVER THE COURSE OF 50 YEARS, 894
PEOPLE HAVE HOSTED "SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE,"

115
00:10:08,111 --> 00:10:12,834
AND IT AMAZES ME
THAT ONLY TWO OF THEM HAVE
COMMITTED MURDER.

116
00:10:14,784 --> 00:10:20,513
EACH WEEK, EACH WEEK A NEW
CELEBRITY HOST COMES IN WITH
THEIR OWN DYNAMIC

117
00:10:20,513 --> 00:10:22,376
AND THEY THROW
EVERYTHING OFF.

118
00:10:22,376 --> 00:10:23,998
BUT NOT YOU, STEVE,

119
00:10:23,998 --> 00:10:27,426
BECAUSE YOU HAVE NO DYNAMIC.
>> THANK YOU.

120
00:10:27,629 --> 00:10:30,883
>> OH MY GOD!

121
00:10:34,566 --> 00:10:39,361
>> LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THE
ONLY CANADIAN WHO WASN'T IN
SCHITT'S CREEK,

MARTIN SHORT.

123
00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:47,635
>> WAIT A SECOND, I THOUGHT WE
WERE HOSTING TOGETHER.

124
00:10:47,635 --> 00:10:50,812
>> DO YOU HAVE YOUR PASSPORT
WITH YOU?
>> NO.

125
00:10:50,812 --> 00:10:52,117
>> I.C.E., GET HIM!

126
00:10:52,117 --> 00:10:55,412
>> NO!
I'LL COOPERATE!
DON'T TAKE ME.

127
00:10:55,412 --> 00:10:59,473
I'LL NAME NAMES.
MIKE MYERS, JIM CARREY!

128
00:10:59,696 --> 00:11:03,915
DAMN YOU, YOU WHITE-HAIRED SON
OF A BITCH!

129
00:11:09,198 --> 00:11:12,237
>> MARTY AND I HAVE BEEN WORKING
TOGETHER SO LONG

130
00:11:12,237 --> 00:11:16,264
THAT WE CAN
ACTUALLY FINISH EACH OTHER'S
CAREERS.

131
00:11:16,481 --> 00:11:22,876
I HOPE YOU ARE ENJOYING MY
MONOLOGUE TONIGHT.

132
00:11:22,876 --> 00:11:25,804
BUT IF YOU AREN'T ENJOYING IT --

133
00:11:26,871 --> 00:11:31,154
MAYBE YOU SHOULD GET UP AND TAKE
A GOOD LOOK AT YOURSELF IN THE MIRROR

134
00:11:31,154 --> 00:11:35,391
AND SAY TO YOURSELF, WHAT
HAVE I BECOME?

135
00:11:35,391 --> 00:11:38,054
THIS CAN'T BE STEVE'S FAULT.

136
00:11:38,054 --> 00:11:43,356
AND ASK YOURSELVES,
WHEN DID I ABANDON JOY?

137
00:11:43,356 --> 00:11:46,305
AND WHAT CAN I BRING TO THE
MONOLOGUE

138
00:11:46,305 --> 00:11:50,450
AS AN AUDIENCE MEMBER
NEXT TIME.

139
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:53,715
ALL RIGHT, WE'VE GOT A GREAT
SHOW TONIGHT.

140
00:11:57,850 --> 00:12:01,830
WE HAVE A GREAT SHOW.

00:12:06,914 --> 00:12:10,321
AND WE'LL BE BACK.
THANK YOU.

144
00:12:17,283 --> 00:12:20,442

150
00:12:40,993 --> 00:12:44,748

DANGEROUSLY CLOSE

151
00:12:44,748 --> 00:12:47,197
TO HIS FANNY
CHEEKS?

152
00:12:47,197 --> 00:12:50,973

00:23:54,117 --> 00:23:55,963
>> IT'S "SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE."

330
00:23:55,963 --> 00:24:00,722
IT'S A SKIT COMEDY SHOW.

337
00:24:21,062 --> 00:24:23,850
TODAY'S BLACK JEOPARDY IS
SPONSORED BY A PLATE.

338
00:24:23,850 --> 00:24:25,846
NOW YOU DON'T HAVE TO SAY FIX ME
A PLATE.

339
00:24:25,846 --> 00:24:28,193
YOU ALREADY GOT ONE.

COOKIES OR A SOWING KIT.

IT'S AN HONOR TO BE HERE ON
BLACK JEOPARDY.

352
00:25:02,348 --> 00:25:05,518
I'VE BEEN A FAN OF THE SHOW SINCE THE '70s

353
00:25:05,518 --> 00:25:09,043
WHEN IT WAS
CALLED "MAMA'S GOT QUESTIONS."

354
00:25:09,048 --> 00:25:13,273
OKAY.
NOW SOME OF Y'ALL MIGHT REMEMBER
ME FROM "SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE."

355
00:25:13,368 --> 00:25:16,854
I WAS A BLACK GUY WHO CAME AFTER
EDDIE MURPHY.

356
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:21,293
THAT'S KIND OF LIKE BEING A THE
POINT GUARD AFTER STEPHEN CURRY.

357
00:25:21,293 --> 00:25:26,243
OKAY.
HERE IS YOUR CLUE ABOUT "SNL."

358
00:25:26,243 --> 00:25:31,604
THIS WAS CHARACTER HAS MADE
PEOPLE LAUGH FOR YEARS.

359
00:25:31,604 --> 00:25:34,300
>> WHO IS MY DEAR?

360
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:37,733
>> NO.
THAT IS NOT TYLER PERRY.

361
00:25:37,733 --> 00:25:40,372
CAN'T YOU SEE THAT SHE IS RIGHT?

362
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:42,454
DOUG

363
00:25:42,454 --> 00:25:44,772
HI

364
00:25:44,772 --> 00:25:47,963

365
00:25:47,963 --> 00:25:51,834
AND THE CHURCH LADY.

366
00:25:51,917 --> 00:25:55,212

YES.
THAT IS CORRECT.

367
00:25:55,212 --> 00:25:57,369
THANK YOU.

$400
FOR YOU.
>> THANK YOU.

369
00:25:59,792 --> 00:26:02,298
SPEAKING OF CHURCH, CAN I SAY
SOMETHING?

370
00:26:02,298 --> 00:26:04,817
IT'S MORE FOLKS WENT TO CHURCH,

371
00:26:04,817 --> 00:26:07,572
WE WOULDN'T BE IN THIS MESS
WE'RE IN NOW.

372
00:26:07,572 --> 00:26:11,225
>> I WOULD LIKE TO SHAKE YOUR
HAND, SIR.
HERE WE GO.

373
00:26:11,225 --> 00:26:14,853
NO

374
00:26:14,853 --> 00:26:17,972
JUST

375
00:26:17,972 --> 00:26:21,033
>> THANK YOU,

376
00:26:21,105 --> 00:26:24,253
NOW MAYBE I'LL START A SHOW FOR YOU TO COME ON

377
00:26:24,253 --> 00:26:26,751
AND WE'LL CALL IT "WHITE
JEOPARDY."

378
00:26:26,751 --> 00:26:29,285
>> WE DON'T NEED IT.
WE DON'T NEED IT.

379
00:26:29,285 --> 00:26:31,708
SLOW IT DOWN A LITTLE BIT.

380
00:26:31,708 --> 00:26:34,844
WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A BREAK.
WHEN WE RETURN TO "BLACK JEOPARDY,"

381
00:26:34,844 --> 00:26:38,278
WE WILL SEE IF ANYONE
HAS WATCHED ANY OF THIS YEAR'S
OSCAR MOVIES.

382
00:26:38,278 --> 00:26:41,193
DOUBT.
WE'LL SEE YOU.

383
00:26:53,398 --> 00:26:55,889
HI

384
00:26:56,477 --> 00:26:59,421
TONIGHT IS A CELEBRATION OF
CLASSIC MOMENTS,

385
00:26:59,421 --> 00:27:02,428
BUT "SNL" WILL
ALWAYS HAVE THAT CONTRARIAN EDGE,

386
00:27:02,428 --> 00:27:06,983
NEVER WANTING TO DO
ANYTHING THAT FEELS TOO OBVIOUS,
TOO ON THE NOSE.

387
00:27:12,066 --> 00:27:14,153
UP HERE?

388
00:27:14,153 --> 00:27:17,803
WHO ARE YOU?
WHAT'S YOUR AGE AND YOUR NAME?

389
00:27:17,803 --> 00:27:24,979
>> LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, MY NAME

390
00:27:28,153 --> 00:27:31,617
I'M PROUD TO SAY I'M 50 YEARS OLD,

391
00:27:31,617 --> 00:27:35,168
JUST LIKE "SATURDAY NIGHT
LIVE."

392
00:27:35,168 --> 00:27:40,371
LISTEN, EMMA, SHE IS NOT ONE
OF THE GALS WHO IS AFRAID TO TELL A REAL,

393
00:27:40,371 --> 00:27:42,508
SHE LIKES TO KICK,

394
00:27:42,508 --> 00:27:45,164
SHRED,

395
00:27:45,164 --> 00:27:47,239

LORNE

404
00:28:25,212 --> 00:28:28,128
>> THE WHOLE NOYFNT SKETCH IS TO
SHOW YOUR FALL.

405
00:28:28,128 --> 00:28:32,323
PEOPLE EXPECT TO SEE YOU FALL.
IT'S A TRADITION.

406
00:28:40,157 --> 00:28:42,404
NO, ABSOLUTELY NOT.
I'M NOT DOING IT.

407
00:28:42,404 --> 00:28:44,621
AND I'M GOING TO TELL YOU WHY.

00:30:11,194 --> 00:30:13,964
>> YOU'RE MAKING ME VERY
UNCOMFORTABLE.

412
00:30:13,964 --> 00:30:17,169
>> NO I'M NOT.
>> YOU KIND OF ARE.

413
00:30:22,950 --> 00:30:24,743
>> MIGHT NEED A WHOLE BOTTLE.

414
00:30:24,743 --> 00:30:27,934
>> I COULD EAT A WHOLE BOTTLE
TOO.

415
00:30:37,236 --> 00:30:40,558
>> JESUS CHRIST!

416
00:31:00,930 --> 00:31:04,712
>> NOW I'VE DONE IT.
I PUT THE CHICKENS ON TO MY
FINGER.

417
00:31:04,816 --> 00:31:07,687
I'M GLAD IN A WAY THIS HAPPENED.

418
00:31:07,688 --> 00:31:09,742

HORSE.

421
00:31:15,124 --> 00:31:17,317
>> DO BE CAREFUL.

422
00:31:17,412 --> 00:31:20,381
>> NO ONE IS WHO THEY APPEAR TO
BE.

423
00:31:29,135 --> 00:31:30,491
MY MOUTH.

424
00:31:30,605 --> 00:31:31,873
BLOOD

425
00:31:31,873 --> 00:31:33,747
>> YOU KNOW WHAT?
APPARENTLY A LOT.

426
00:31:33,747 --> 00:31:37,077
I'LL STOP BLEEDING IF YOU OPEN

>> NO, I'VE GOT IT.

430
00:32:47,477 --> 00:32:49,569
ANYWAY

431
00:32:51,571 --> 00:32:56,554
>> WHEN OUR DAUGHTER KELSEY TOLD
US THAT SHE AND MATT WANTED TO
DO A VOWEL RENEWAL,

432
00:32:56,554 --> 00:33:00,118
WE WERE A
LITTLE SURPRISED SINCE THEY'VE
ONLY BEEN MARRIED LESS THAN A YEAR,

433
00:33:00,118 --> 00:33:02,095
BUT HEY,

434
00:33:02,095 --> 00:33:06,303
WHAT'S ANOTHER 70
GRAND AT BEST WESTERN.

435
00:33:08,003 --> 00:33:12,846

00:33:17,113 --> 00:33:20,441
>> I APOLOGIZE.
MY WIFE IS DOING WET FEBRUARY.

438
00:33:20,441 --> 00:33:23,183
>> OH HELL YES I AM.

439
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:28,908
>> ANY WAY,

440
00:33:28,908 --> 00:33:30,922
KELSEY AND MATT --

441
00:33:30,922 --> 00:33:34,578
>> I WANT TO SAY, LET ME TAKE
THE RING.

442
00:33:34,578 --> 00:33:37,574
>> SURE.
ANYTIME

443
00:33:38,629 --> 00:33:43,741
MAY YOU HAVE A MARRIAGE AS
LOVING AND PASSIONATE AS DADDY
AND ME.

444
00:33:43,741 --> 00:33:46,942
>> OH, BABY.
HOW ABOUT YOU.

445
00:33:54,637 --> 00:33:56,964
WHAT HAPPENED?
WHAT HAPPENED?

446
00:33:56,964 --> 00:33:59,289
>> OKAY.

447
00:33:59,290 --> 00:34:01,650
SPEECH

448
00:34:01,650 --> 00:34:04,520
FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO DON'T KNOW ME,

449
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:07,365
I'M SOPHIE, THE BRIDE'S
CHILDHOOD BESTIE.

450
00:34:07,365 --> 00:34:10,030
I COULDN'T MAKE IT TO THE
WEDDING BECAUSE I WAS
UNFORTUNATELY IN PRISON.

451
00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:12,897
>> YOU GOT SO SKINNY IN JAIL,
GIRL.

452
00:34:12,897 --> 00:34:15,754
>> I KNOW, RIGHT?
I COULDN'T EAT THE FOOD.

453
00:34:15,754 --> 00:34:17,636
ANY WAY,

454
00:34:17,636 --> 00:34:22,359
I'D LOVE TO INVITE KELSEY'S BEST FRIENDS AKA, THE
KEL SQUAD.

455
00:34:22,359 --> 00:34:23,865
HI

456
00:34:23,865 --> 00:34:27,312
>> SO INSTEAD OF A SPEECH, WE'RE
GOING TO DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT FOR Y'ALL,

457
00:34:27,312 --> 00:34:32,041
BECAUSE WE'RE A
LITTLE BIT BASIC, A LITTLE BIT
TOXIC.

458
00:34:32,169 --> 00:34:37,015
>> SO AS SOME OF YOU KNOW, WE
TOOK KELSEY TO CITY TO CELEBRATE
RENEWAL.

459
00:34:37,015 --> 00:34:42,413
>> MATT SAID IT HAD TO BE A DAY
TRIP BECAUSE HE DOESN'T TRUST
OVERNIGHTS ANYMORE.

460
00:34:42,413 --> 00:34:44,230
>> GUILTY AS CHARGED.

461
00:34:44,230 --> 00:34:47,226
SERIOUSLY, I LOVE STRONG WOMEN.

462
00:34:47,226 --> 00:34:52,212
>> WHILE IN NEW YORK, WE GOT
BLACKOUT DRUNK AND WENT TO
WICKED.

463
00:34:52,309 --> 00:34:56,188
SO MATT AND KELSEY, THIS IS FOR
YOU.

464
00:34:58,883 --> 00:35:02,138
HAS CHANGED

465
00:35:02,138 --> 00:35:04,784
SHE'S READY TO COMMIT ¶

466
00:35:04,881 --> 00:35:07,931
¶ SEES A THING IN MATTHEW

467
00:35:07,931 --> 00:35:12,529

00:35:13,881 --> 00:35:16,110
¶ AND WORKED ON HERSELF,

470
00:35:16,110 --> 00:35:19,245
AND MATT HAS GONE TO THE GYM ¶

471
00:35:19,245 --> 00:35:21,790
KELSEY HAS MADE A COMMITMENT,

472
00:35:21,790 --> 00:35:24,127
SO GUESS WHAT?
THIS JUST IN ¶

473

¶ SHE'S GOING TO TRY MONOGAMY,

474
00:35:30,418 --> 00:35:36,167
SHE'S FINALLY LEARNED WHAT IS
MONOGAMY ¶

475
00:35:36,167 --> 00:35:41,859
¶ AND WE WILL HOLD HER DAWN ¶

476
00:35:47,354 --> 00:35:48,785
>> HEY, WELL, THAT WAS GREAT.

477
00:35:48,785 --> 00:35:52,259
AND NOW THE SONG IS OVER, AND WE
WILL NOT LEARN ANYTHING ELSE.

478
00:35:52,334 --> 00:35:55,210
>> REALLY?
BECAUSE A LOT MORE HAPPENED.

479
00:35:55,301 --> 00:35:59,373
>> OH MY GOD, DOING TAYLOR.

480

¶ AFTER THE SHOW, IN TIMES SQUARE,

481
00:36:04,695 --> 00:36:08,423
THERE IS A WHACK KIAN
KNOW REEVES, BUT KELSEY DOESN'T CARE

482
00:36:08,423 --> 00:36:13,992
IT'S CLEAR THAT KELSEY'S
MIND IS ELSEWHERE ¶

483
00:36:13,992 --> 00:36:15,341
>> WHAT WERE YOU THINKING ABOUT?

484
00:36:15,341 --> 00:36:18,588
>> MY FRIENDS ARE SINGING.

485
00:36:18,588 --> 00:36:23,245
¶ NEXT UP WE TAKE A PEDICAB IN

ANOTHER MAJOR LIFE EVENT OF

MATTHEW'S MY GUY, SAID HE'S NOT MINE,

>> WELL, I DID THEIR KITCHEN
RENOVATION

545
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:48,403
AND THEN I HAD SEX
WITH THE WIFE.

>> FEEL YOU, SANTIAGO.

547

JACK

>> LOOKING BACK OVER 50 YEARS,

556
00:40:37,034 --> 00:40:41,270
WE TREASURE THE LAUGHS, THE
FRIENDSHIPS, THE FOND MEMORIES.

557
00:40:41,270 --> 00:40:45,155
BUT THE REAL TREASURE WAS HOW
MUCH MONEY WE WERE MAKING.

558
00:40:50,167 --> 00:40:56,252
LADIES

559
00:40:59,105 --> 00:41:02,099
>> OH, WOW.
WHAT A NIGHT.

560
00:41:02,099 --> 00:41:07,643
WELL, EVEN AFTER 50 YEARS, THERE
ARE STILL THINGS ABOUT "SNL"
THAT PEOPLE DON'T KNOW.

561
00:41:07,702 --> 00:41:12,300
SO WE ARE HERE TO ANSWER ANY
QUESTIONS PEOPLE STILL HAVE
ABOUT THE SHOW.

562
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:14,907
DON'T BE SHY.
JUST RAISE YOUR HAND.

563
00:41:14,907 --> 00:41:16,472
YES, QUINTA BRUNSON.

564
00:41:16,472 --> 00:41:19,775
>> HI.
>> HI!
>> HI.

565
00:41:19,775 --> 00:41:21,648
HI

QUINTA BRUNSON HERE.

567
00:41:23,664 --> 00:41:27,903
FIRST OF ALL, I WANT TO SAY, YOU
LADIES LOOK GREAT.
WHAT'S YOUR SECRET?

568
00:41:27,903 --> 00:41:31,525
>> WOW, THANK YOU FOR ASKING
THAT QUESTION WE WROTE.

569
00:41:31,863 --> 00:41:36,125
I'M WEARING A 3D PRINTED MASK OF
MY YOUNGER SELF.

570
00:41:36,125 --> 00:41:38,645
>> AND MY FACE IS ALL NATURAL,

571
00:41:38,645 --> 00:41:41,218
BUT FULL DISCLOSURE, THIS IS THE
BACK OF MY HEAD.

572
00:41:41,218 --> 00:41:44,103
I SLIP MID HAIR AND STARTED
OVER.

573
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:46,990
>> WELL, IT'S WORKING FOR YOU,
BABY GIRL.

574
00:41:46,990 --> 00:41:49,754
ANY WAY, I AM A "SNL" SUPERFAN.

575
00:41:49,754 --> 00:41:52,364
MY QUESTION IS KIND OF A DEEP
CUT.

576
00:41:52,364 --> 00:41:56,646
IN THE MARCH 18th, 1993 GOOD NIGHTS,

577
00:41:56,646 --> 00:41:59,923
TIM MEADOWS WHISPERED
SOMETHING TO MUSICAL GUEST SADE?

578
00:41:59,923 --> 00:42:01,364
WHAT WAS HE SAYING?

579
00:42:01,364 --> 00:42:02,968
>> OH, WOW, LET'S FIND OUT.

580
00:42:02,968 --> 00:42:05,587
TIM, DO YOU REMEMBER WHAT YOU
WERE SAYING?

581
00:42:05,587 --> 00:42:08,803
>> OH, YEAH, WOW.

582
00:42:11,882 --> 00:42:13,563
THANK YOU.

583
00:42:13,563 --> 00:42:16,491
YES, IT WAS MARCH '93.

584
00:42:16,491 --> 00:42:21,328
I'M PRETTY SURE I WAS SAYING
HEY, SADE, YOU WANT TO DRINK
SOME ZIMA WITH ME IN MY DRESSING
ROOM?

585
00:42:21,328 --> 00:42:27,648
WE CAN PLAY MORTAL KOMBAT 1 AND
WATCH THE NEW MENENDEZ TRIAL.

586
00:42:27,728 --> 00:42:29,730
>> THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I
THOUGHT.

587
00:42:29,730 --> 00:42:32,618
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.

588
00:42:33,233 --> 00:42:37,689
>> ALSO, AT WORK BY THE WAY,
SADE ARE STILL TOGETHER.

589
00:42:37,689 --> 00:42:39,677
>> THAT'S AWESOME.
THAT'S AWESOME.

590
00:42:39,677 --> 00:42:41,144
WHO ELSE HAS A QUESTION?

591
00:42:41,144 --> 00:42:42,264
>> I HAVE A QUESTION.

592
00:42:42,264 --> 00:42:45,534
>> OH, HI, RYAN REYNOLDS, HI.

593
00:42:47,139 --> 00:42:50,328
HOW'S IT GOING?
>> GREAT.

594
00:42:50,328 --> 00:42:52,420
WHY, WHAT HAVE YOU HEARD?

595
00:42:58,427 --> 00:43:03,400
MY QUESTION IS YOU KNOW THE
MATERIALS THAT THEY MADE THE CONEHEADS WITH,

596
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:05,471
ARE THOSE
EDIBLE?

597
00:43:05,471 --> 00:43:07,471
>> EDIBLE?
NO, NO.

598
00:43:07,471 --> 00:43:11,818
AND BASED ON THEM BEING MADE IN
1975, I'D ASSUME THEY'RE HIGHLY
TOXIC.

599
00:43:11,818 --> 00:43:15,408
>> OH, OKAY.
SO SOMEBODY HYPOTHETICALLY

600
00:43:15,408 --> 00:43:18,542
TOOK
A COUPLE NIBBLES BACKSTAGE AND GOT EXCITED,

601
00:43:18,542 --> 00:43:20,769
SHOULD THEY GO TO
THE HOSPITAL OR SHOULD THEY --

602
00:43:20,769 --> 00:43:23,192
>> YES, THEY SHOULD GO TO
HOSPITAL RIGHT AWAY.

603
00:43:23,192 --> 00:43:24,405
>> GOOD.
>> GOOD LUCK.

604
00:43:24,405 --> 00:43:26,320
NEXT QUESTION --

605
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:28,505
>> I HAVE A QUESTION.
>> YES?

606
00:43:28,505 --> 00:43:31,285
NATE

607
00:43:31,285 --> 00:43:34,342
>> WHEN I HOSTED THE SHOW, THERE
WAS A WOMAN

608
00:43:34,342 --> 00:43:37,449
WHO PULLED ME BEHIND
A LITTLE CURTAIN AND TOOK MY
PANTS OFF.

609
00:43:37,449 --> 00:43:40,233
DOES SHE WORK HERE?

610
00:43:40,233 --> 00:43:42,720
>> IS SHE A BLOND WOMAN WITH A
STOPWATCH?

611
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:47,700
>> YEAH.
SHE PUT HER ARM AROUND MY WAIST
AND KIND OF SHOOK ME UNTIL MY
SHOES FELL OFF.

612
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:50,017
DID I DREAM THAT OR IS THAT --

613
00:43:50,017 --> 00:43:53,499
>> NO, THAT'S DONNA.
COME OUT HERE, DONNA.

614
00:44:04,501 --> 00:44:06,831
>> DONNA,

615
00:44:06,831 --> 00:44:11,947
DONNA HAS BEEN
DRESSING EVERY HOST SINCE 1997.

616
00:44:11,947 --> 00:44:16,724
SHE HAS SEEN EVERY CELEBRITY
HERE IN THEIR UNDERPANTS.

617
00:44:16,724 --> 00:44:19,671
>> DONNA, I KNOW IT'S HARD TO
PICK, BUT WHO WAS YOUR FAV --

618
00:44:19,671 --> 00:44:22,347
>> JASON MOMOA.

619
00:44:26,335 --> 00:44:29,903
>> OUR NEXT QUESTION WAS
SUBMITTED BY A VIEWER.

620
00:44:29,903 --> 00:44:33,391
LOVED FAN 89 WANTS TO KNOW

621
00:44:33,391 --> 00:44:38,925
WHY AM I SEATED ACROSS THE STREET IN
THE AMERICAN GIRLS STORE?

622
00:44:38,841 --> 00:44:41,830
>> I'M NOT MAD.
I JUST WANT TO KNOW WHY.

623
00:44:41,830 --> 00:44:43,902
LADIES?

624
00:44:47,689 --> 00:44:50,592
SO LOVITZ FAN IS JON LOVITZ.

625
00:44:50,592 --> 00:44:54,656
I KNOW THE SEATING CHART WAS
REALLY HARD TO FIGURE OUT.

626
00:44:54,656 --> 00:44:56,844
YOU WERE GOING TO BE SEATED IN
THE STUDIO, 

627
00:44:56,844 --> 00:45:01,597
BUT THEN JULIA
LOUIS-DREYFUS ASKED TO BRING HER
SERVICE DOG.

628
00:45:01,597 --> 00:45:03,273
GREAT

629
00:45:03,273 --> 00:45:07,169
>> YEAH, SORRY.
JON, IT'S A MEDICAL THING.

630
00:45:07,169 --> 00:45:09,142
YOU REALLY NEED THAT DOG, RIGHT,
JULIA?

631
00:45:09,142 --> 00:45:13,912
>> OH, NO, NO, NO.
I'M HERE FOR HIM.
HE IS BLIND.

632
00:45:15,109 --> 00:45:19,403
>> SO RICKY, THE BLOND WOMAN WHO
JUST TALKED, 

633
00:45:19,403 --> 00:45:21,420
THAT'S AMY POEHLER.

634
00:45:21,420 --> 00:45:26,023
AND THE OLDER WOMAN NEXT TO HER
IS TINA FEY.

635
00:45:27,025 --> 00:45:31,332
AND THE INTENSE ENERGY THAT
YOU'RE FEELING TO YOUR LEFT

636
00:45:31,332 --> 00:45:34,042
 IS ADAM DRIVER.

637
00:45:37,650 --> 00:45:40,498
HE IS AN ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE
ACTOR.

638
00:45:40,498 --> 00:45:45,971
AND RIGHT NOW HE IS ACTING LIKE
HE IS NOT ATTRACTED TO ME.

639
00:45:45,971 --> 00:45:49,268
HOW YOU DOING?
THIS IS MY PUPPY HERE.

640
00:45:49,268 --> 00:45:51,586
YEAH.

00:45:51,586 --> 00:45:55,031
>> OKAY.
ALL RIGHT.
LET'S TAKE ANOTHER QUESTION.

642
00:45:55,031 --> 00:45:57,916
YES, CHER, YOU HAVE A QUESTION?

643
00:45:57,916 --> 00:46:00,955
>> NO, I DON'T.

644
00:46:00,955 --> 00:46:04,458

646
00:46:08,665 --> 00:46:10,271

649
00:46:23,665 --> 00:46:27,762
AND I'M KIND OF WONDERING IF
ANYBODY HAS SEEN IT AROUND.

650
00:46:27,762 --> 00:46:32,750
>> A SCARF, YEAH, IN 1998?
WELL, THAT'S A LONG TIME AGO.

651
00:46:32,750 --> 00:46:34,809
>> I DON'T THINK SO.
I'M NOT SURE.

652
00:46:34,809 --> 00:46:37,714
>> LOOK, IT'S SIMPLY NOT HERE,

>> WHENEVER WE ASK YOU TO DO A
BIT, YOU ALWAYS SAY YES.

662
00:47:05,486 --> 00:47:07,829
AND THAT'S WHAT MATTERS.

AIR TIME TO CELEBRITIES WHO

674

THANK YOU, GUYS.

694
00:48:34,195 --> 00:48:37,697

695
00:48:37,699 --> 00:48:38,764
LORNE CUT "VAMPIRE OFFICE"?

SKETCH CALLED "VAMPIRE OFFICE"

699
00:48:45,940 --> 00:48:47,039
AND IT PLAYED PRETTY WELL AT

700
00:48:47,041 --> 00:48:48,407
DRESS AND IT DIDN'T GET ON AIR.

701
00:48:48,409 --> 00:48:50,509
>> OKAY, I GUESS MAYBE OTHER

702
00:48:50,511 --> 00:48:51,277

703

>> NO.

704
00:48:52,213 --> 00:48:52,945
IT WAS A PRETTY BAD SHOW FRONT

706
00:48:53,548 --> 00:48:55,881

708
00:48:57,352 --> 00:48:58,417

>> WELL, DO YOU KNOW IF HE SAW

THE CHANGES I WAS GOING TO MAKE,

711

BECAUSE I CUT THE B WORD AS

LORNE, NEVER RETIRE.

730
00:49:42,930 --> 00:49:45,965
IT'S BRUTAL OUT HERE.

731
00:49:45,967 --> 00:49:48,200

01:07:14,581 --> 01:07:15,713
YOU KNOW, IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE

1115
01:07:17,417 --> 01:07:19,317
ABOUT LORNE MICHAELS, AND NO ONE

1116
01:07:19,319 --> 01:07:21,619
KNOWS HIM BETTER THAN OUR NEXT

1117
01:07:21,621 --> 01:07:21,986
GUEST.

1118
01:07:21,988 --> 01:07:23,121
PLEASE WELCOME LORNE'S BEST

1119
01:07:23,123 --> 01:07:23,988
FRIENDS FROM GROWING UP.

1120
01:07:27,994 --> 01:07:30,195
>> HI, GUYS.

1121
01:07:30,197 --> 01:07:30,862
HOW YOU DOING?

1122
01:07:30,864 --> 01:07:32,163
>> BETTER THAN ANYONE.

1123
01:07:32,165 --> 01:07:33,198
WHAT'S LORNE REALLY LIKE?

1124
01:07:33,200 --> 01:07:34,399
>> OH, HE IS THE BEST.

1125
01:07:34,401 --> 01:07:35,567
HE IS RELAX AND CHILL.

1126
01:07:35,569 --> 01:07:38,036
>> HE IS SUPER DOWN TO EARTH AND

1127
01:07:38,038 --> 01:07:38,470
APPROACHABLE.

1128
01:07:38,472 --> 01:07:39,137
WE LOVE, WE LOVE HIM.

1129
01:07:39,139 --> 01:07:39,671
>> HE IS OUR BUDDY.

1130
01:07:39,673 --> 01:07:43,508
>> TOTALLY, YES.

1131
01:07:43,510 --> 01:07:49,314
>> I WILL SAY SOMETIMES HE CAN

1132
01:07:49,316 --> 01:07:50,415
BE A LITTLE RUDE.

1133
01:07:50,417 --> 01:07:52,317
>> YEAH, LIKE A MONTH AGO, HE

1134
01:07:52,319 --> 01:07:53,918
ASKED US TO HELP HIM MOVE.

1135
01:07:53,920 --> 01:07:55,520
AND WE'RE LIKE SURE, OF COURSE.

1136
01:07:55,522 --> 01:07:56,421
HELP YOU MOVE.

1137
01:07:56,423 --> 01:07:58,123
HAVE A LITTLE DINNER, WHATEVER.

1138
01:07:58,125 --> 01:07:59,524
>> SO WE GET THERE.

1139
01:07:59,526 --> 01:08:01,459
LORNE OPENS THE DOOR, AND HE IS

1140
01:08:01,461 --> 01:08:04,095
LIKE OH, YOU TWO.

1141
01:08:04,097 --> 01:08:05,997
AND WE'RE LIKE WHAT?

1142
01:08:05,999 --> 01:08:07,599
>> YOU INVITED US.

1143
01:08:07,601 --> 01:08:08,833
WE DON'T HAVE TO BE HERE.

1144
01:08:08,835 --> 01:08:09,901
>> SO WE LOOK AROUND.

1145
01:08:09,903 --> 01:08:10,435
NOTHING IS PACKED.

1146
01:08:10,437 --> 01:08:14,139
>> NOTHING IS PACKED.

1147
01:08:14,141 --> 01:08:16,941
>> YOU HAVEN'T EVEN STARTED YET?

1148
01:08:16,943 --> 01:08:18,843
AND THEN HE STARTS POINTING AT

1149
01:08:18,845 --> 01:08:20,345
PAINTINGS AND SAYING THIS IS

1150
01:08:20,347 --> 01:08:22,780
FROM STEVE, THIS IS FROM PAUL,

1151
01:08:22,782 --> 01:08:24,282
THIS IS FROM MICK.

1152
01:08:24,284 --> 01:08:25,517
>> AND DOES HE MEAN MICK JAGGER?

1153
01:08:25,519 --> 01:08:28,620
>> JUST TO SAY IT.

1154
01:08:28,622 --> 01:08:29,854
>> I'M SORRY, YOU GUYS HAVE TO

1155
01:08:29,856 --> 01:08:30,221
SPEAK UP.

1156
01:08:30,223 --> 01:08:30,955
I DON'T THINK ANYBODY CAN HEAR

1157
01:08:30,957 --> 01:08:32,423
YOU.

1158
01:08:32,425 --> 01:08:34,459
BUT ALSO, IT DOES SOUND LIKE

1159
01:08:34,461 --> 01:08:35,727
MAYBE LORNE CAN BE A LITTLE

1160
01:08:35,729 --> 01:08:36,127
DIFFICULT.

1161
01:08:36,129 --> 01:08:36,494
>> NO.

1162
01:08:36,496 --> 01:08:37,095
>> NO, NO.

1163
01:08:37,097 --> 01:08:37,362
NO.

1164
01:08:37,364 --> 01:08:37,962
>> HE IS OUR FRIEND.

1165
01:08:37,964 --> 01:08:39,097
>> HE IS OUR BEST FRIEND.

1166
01:08:39,099 --> 01:08:42,967
>> HE IS EASY-BREEZY CRAZY TIME,

1167
01:08:42,969 --> 01:08:46,037
ALL OF IT.

1168
01:08:46,039 --> 01:08:48,873
I WILL SAY HE CAN BE KIND OF

1169
01:08:48,875 --> 01:08:49,908
LIKE INCONSIDERATE.

1170
01:08:49,910 --> 01:08:52,210
LIKE WE'RE PACKING HIS STUFF FOR

1171
01:08:52,212 --> 01:08:53,578
HOURS, AND HE'S GONE.

1172
01:08:53,580 --> 01:08:57,549
AND HE COMES BACK, AND OH, HEY,

1173
01:08:57,551 --> 01:08:59,250
LIKE WHICH BATHROOM CAN I USE?

1174
01:08:59,252 --> 01:09:00,985
AND HE GOES THERE IS A STARBUCKS

1175
01:09:00,987 --> 01:09:03,755
ACROSS THE STREET.

1176
01:09:03,757 --> 01:09:06,357
BUT YOU HAVE TO BUY SOMETHING

1177
01:09:06,359 --> 01:09:06,658
FIRST.

1178
01:09:06,660 --> 01:09:07,358
SO GET ME A LATTE.

1179
01:09:07,360 --> 01:09:10,828
WHAT?

1180
01:09:10,830 --> 01:09:15,300
WE'RE HELPING YOU MOVE.

BUT IT SEEMS LIKE MAYBE YOU GUYS

01:09:21,241 --> 01:09:21,539
HIM.

1186
01:09:21,541 --> 01:09:23,041
>> OH, NO, NO, NO.

1187
01:09:23,043 --> 01:09:23,575
>> BEST FRIENDS.

1188
01:09:23,577 --> 01:09:24,542
>> HE IS OUR PERSON.

1189
01:09:24,544 --> 01:09:26,311
HE IS OUR PERSON.

1190
01:09:26,313 --> 01:09:26,978
>> MY EMERGENCY CONTACT.

1191
01:09:26,980 --> 01:09:29,347
>> HE GETS ALL MY ORGANS IF I

1192

DIE.

1193

I LOVE HIM SO MUCH.

1194
01:09:31,451 --> 01:09:32,350
BUT ANY WAY, IT'S LIKE IT'S

1196

HE IS HE SAYING WE'RE FAT?

1206
01:09:55,709 --> 01:09:57,275
>> HE CAN'T TALK TO US LIKE

1207
01:09:57,277 --> 01:09:57,575
THAT.

1208

NBC'S BREATHING DOWN MY NECK.

01:12:19,652 --> 01:12:22,787
>> OKAY, OKAY.

1273
01:12:22,789 --> 01:12:23,421
>> I HAD YOU FOR A SECOND.

1274
01:12:23,423 --> 01:12:27,091
DON'T WORRY.

1275
01:12:27,093 --> 01:12:31,896
NUMBERS 9, 8, AND 7, OKAY?

1276
01:12:31,898 --> 01:12:33,331
HEADS UP, KEVIN NEALON.

1277
01:12:33,333 --> 01:12:37,368
COME ON!

1278
01:12:37,370 --> 01:12:43,708
DENNIS MILLER, AND SETH MEYERS.

1279
01:12:44,477 --> 01:12:44,709
.

1280
01:12:44,711 --> 01:12:46,377
I JUST WISH WE HAD THE TIME

1281
01:12:46,379 --> 01:12:47,979
TONIGHT TO SAY SOMETHING NICE

1282
01:12:47,981 --> 01:12:48,946
ABOUT ANY OF THEM.

1283
01:12:48,948 --> 01:12:50,381
>> WE ACTUALLY DO PROBABLY HAVE

1284
01:12:50,383 --> 01:12:51,149
ENOUGH TIME.

1285
01:12:51,151 --> 01:12:53,651
>> WE'RE RIGHT HERE AT 6:00 NOW.

1286
01:12:53,653 --> 01:12:54,152
OKAY.

1287
01:12:54,154 --> 01:12:55,586
COLIN, THIS COULD BE YOU, HUH?

1288
01:12:55,588 --> 01:12:56,988
>> IS IT?

1289
01:12:56,990 --> 01:12:59,957
>> NO, IT IS NOT.

1290
01:12:59,959 --> 01:13:00,691
THE NEXT TWO ARE CONTROVERSIAL.

1291
01:13:00,693 --> 01:13:03,094
THIS WAS TOUGH.

1292
01:13:03,096 --> 01:13:09,233
BUT I'M GOING TO PUT TINA AND

1293
01:13:09,235 --> 01:13:12,503
AMY JUST AHEAD OF TINA AND

1294
01:13:12,505 --> 01:13:12,804
JIMMY.

1295
01:13:12,806 --> 01:13:13,704
>> OKAY.

1296
01:13:13,706 --> 01:13:16,007
>> SORRY, JIMMY, I'M SORRY.

1297
01:13:16,009 --> 01:13:18,976
AND CONGRATULATIONS, TINA.

1298
01:13:18,978 --> 01:13:21,446
IT WAS CLOSE, BUT I CHECKED

1299
01:13:21,448 --> 01:13:22,146
ONLINE, AND GIRL ON GIRL IS

1300
01:13:22,148 --> 01:13:26,884
STILL VERY, VERY POPULAR.

1301
01:13:26,886 --> 01:13:27,185
OKAY.

1302
01:13:27,187 --> 01:13:30,154
NEXT UP, CORNELIUS CRANE CHASE.

1303
01:13:30,156 --> 01:13:31,422
>> HMM.

1304
01:13:31,424 --> 01:13:32,190
>> WHO WE'VE ALL COME TO KNOW AS

1305
01:13:32,192 --> 01:13:35,493
CONNIE.

1306
01:13:35,495 --> 01:13:38,062
LET'S FACE IT, WEEKEND UPDATES

1307
01:13:38,064 --> 01:13:38,796
SIMPLY WOULD NOT EXIST WITHOUT

1308
01:13:38,798 --> 01:13:40,331
HIM.

1309
01:13:40,333 --> 01:13:42,834
SO IT WOULD BE WRONG TO HAVE HIM

1310
01:13:42,836 --> 01:13:43,634
LISTED AT ANYWHERE BUT NUMBER

1311
01:13:43,636 --> 01:13:44,335
FOUR.

1312
01:13:49,876 --> 01:13:53,311
NUMBER THREE, JANE CURTAIN AND

1313
01:13:53,313 --> 01:13:53,744
DANNY ACKROYD.

1314
01:13:56,850 --> 01:13:59,383
A TRUE STORY, I WAS THE FIRST TO

1315
01:13:59,385 --> 01:14:01,285
CALL JANE AN IGNORANT SLUT.

1316
01:14:01,287 --> 01:14:04,489
BACKSTAGE.

1317
01:14:04,491 --> 01:14:06,891
DANNY HAD THE BRILLIANT IDEA TO

1318
01:14:06,893 --> 01:14:08,626
SAY IT ON CAMERA, AND REALLY,

1319
01:14:08,628 --> 01:14:13,364
REALLY MEAN IT.

1320
01:14:13,366 --> 01:14:15,600
NUMBER TWO IS NORM McDONALD.

1321
01:14:22,075 --> 01:14:23,641
HE MAY HAVE BEEN THE BEST EVER,

1322
01:14:23,643 --> 01:14:24,942
BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY, HE MADE

1323
01:14:24,944 --> 01:14:31,415
ME, FOR ONE, ASK THE QUESTION OF

1324
01:14:31,417 --> 01:14:32,149
MYSELF COULD O.J. POSSIBLY HAVE

1325
01:14:32,151 --> 01:14:42,059
DONE IT?

1326
01:14:46,799 --> 01:14:49,901
SO THAT BRINGS US TO NUMBER ONE.

1327
01:14:49,903 --> 01:14:50,201
COLIN?

1328
01:14:50,203 --> 01:14:53,204
GOT A GOOD FEELING ABOUT THIS.

1329
01:14:53,206 --> 01:14:53,504
OKAY.

1330
01:14:53,506 --> 01:14:58,442
NUMBER ONE IS FUNNY, GOT A GREAT

1331
01:14:58,444 --> 01:15:00,878
SMILE, HA, AND HE IS CURRENTLY

1332
01:15:00,880 --> 01:15:01,846
SLEEPING EVERY KIND OF WAY WITH

1333
01:15:01,848 --> 01:15:04,048
THE LOVELY ACTRESS SCARLETT

1334
01:15:04,050 --> 01:15:04,415
JOHANSSON.

1335
01:15:04,417 --> 01:15:08,286
OF COURSE I'M TALKING ABOUT MY

1336
01:15:08,288 --> 01:15:12,924
BROTHER, BRIAN

1337
01:15:13,326 --> 01:15:13,758
>> WHAT?

1338
01:15:13,760 --> 01:15:14,225
>> YES.

1339
01:15:14,227 --> 01:15:14,725
>> WOW.

1340
01:15:14,727 --> 01:15:19,697
>> I'M TOLD A VERY, VERY

1341
01:15:19,699 --> 01:15:20,498
CONSIDERATE LOVER.

1342
01:15:20,500 --> 01:15:22,199
I COULDN'T BE HAPPIER TO BE

1343
01:15:22,201 --> 01:15:22,500
HERE.

1344
01:15:22,502 --> 01:15:23,568
>> BILL MURRAY, EVERYBODY.

1345
01:15:23,570 --> 01:15:24,035
I'M MICHAEL CHE.

1346
01:15:24,037 --> 01:15:26,003
GOOD NIGHT!

1347
01:15:35,814 --> 01:15:39,817
U.S. SPACE FORCE.

1348
01:15:39,819 --> 01:15:42,386
THIS IS DR. TYLER FROM SETI.

1349
01:15:42,388 --> 01:15:44,488
>> WE ARE EAGER TO TALK TO YOU

1350
01:15:44,490 --> 01:15:46,524
AS YOU HAVE ALL EXPERIENCE

1351
01:15:46,526 --> 01:15:49,160
ADVAIRIFIED ALIEN ABDUCTION.

1352
01:15:49,162 --> 01:15:51,228
>> THIS IS WILD.

1353
01:15:51,230 --> 01:15:52,897
ONE MINUTE WE'RE THREE FRIENDS

1354
01:15:52,899 --> 01:15:54,432
SLAMMING MILLER TALL BOYS BEHIND

1355
01:15:54,434 --> 01:15:55,666
THE DOLLAR TREE, NOW WE'RE

1356
01:15:55,668 --> 01:15:56,701
SITTING AT THE PENTAGON.

1357
01:15:56,703 --> 01:15:59,270
>> HEY, I'VE BEEN MEANING TO ASK

1358
01:15:59,272 --> 01:16:01,772
LIKE WHY DO YOU CALL IT THE

1359
01:16:01,774 --> 01:16:03,007
PENTAGON WHEN IT'S ONLY GOT FIVE

1360
01:16:03,009 --> 01:16:06,444
SIDES?

1361
01:16:06,446 --> 01:16:09,480
>> BECAUSE A SHAPE WITH FIVE

1362
01:16:09,482 --> 01:16:10,681
SIDES IS CALLED A PENTAGON.

1363
01:16:10,683 --> 01:16:13,918
>> I DON'T THINK THAT'S RIGHT.

1364
01:16:13,920 --> 01:16:15,219
>> WE'LL LOOK INTO IT.

1365
01:16:15,221 --> 01:16:18,589
NOW LET'S START WITH HOW YOU

1366
01:16:18,591 --> 01:16:20,358
WERE ALL BROUGHT ABOARD THE

1367
01:16:20,360 --> 01:16:20,758
SPACECRAFT.

1368
01:16:20,760 --> 01:16:22,627
>> WELL, THIS BEAM OF LIGHT

1369
01:16:22,629 --> 01:16:23,561
APPEARED FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE

1370
01:16:23,563 --> 01:16:24,028
SHIP.

1371
01:16:24,030 --> 01:16:26,797
FLOATED ME UP LIKE A SAW PAN

1372
01:16:26,799 --> 01:16:27,365
BECKONING ME.

1373
01:16:27,367 --> 01:16:29,433
>> SAME-SAME, AND WE MET THESE

1374
01:16:29,435 --> 01:16:31,736
TWO BEAUTIFUL GLOWING ALIENS WHO

1375
01:16:31,738 --> 01:16:33,571
TOOK OUR HANDS AND SAID

1376
01:16:33,573 --> 01:16:36,140
WELCOME.

1377
01:16:36,142 --> 01:16:38,709
I'VE NEVER FELT SO SAFE.

1378
01:16:38,711 --> 01:16:44,181
>> AND YOU, MS. RAFFERTY?

1379
01:16:44,183 --> 01:16:46,484
>> YEAH, A LITTLE DIFFERENT FOR

1380
01:16:46,486 --> 01:16:46,951
ME.

1381
01:16:46,953 --> 01:16:50,955
I WAS LESS CRADLED BY LIGHT AND

1382
01:16:50,957 --> 01:16:52,289
MORE GRABBED BY A GIANT RUSTY

1383
01:16:52,291 --> 01:16:53,557
CLAW WHICH YANKED ME RIGHT OUT

1384
01:16:53,559 --> 01:16:55,426
OF MY SLACKS.

1385
01:16:55,428 --> 01:16:57,628
SO I'M PANTSLESS, RIGHT?

1386
01:16:57,630 --> 01:17:00,865
I'M FOLDED IN HALF LIKE A

1387
01:17:00,867 --> 01:17:01,298
WALLET.

1388
01:17:01,300 --> 01:17:04,301
I'M GETTING WINCHED SKYWARD WITH

1389
01:17:04,303 --> 01:17:08,339
MY VAGITA AND MY TRAGEDY, AND

1390
01:17:08,341 --> 01:17:09,907
AYE TOSSED INTO THE BOTTOM OF

1391
01:17:09,909 --> 01:17:10,808
THE SHIP.

1392
01:17:10,810 --> 01:17:13,244
I SEE MY OLD PALS THE GRAY

1393
01:17:13,246 --> 01:17:15,146
ALIENS WITH THE BIG DUMB EYES.

1394
01:17:15,148 --> 01:17:17,048
>> MRS. RAFFERTY, I'M TOLD THIS

1395
01:17:17,050 --> 01:17:18,449
IS YOUR FIFTH TIME BEING

1396
01:17:18,451 --> 01:17:21,385
ABDUCTED BY THESE GRAY ALIENS?

1397
01:17:21,387 --> 01:17:21,719
>> YEAH.

1398
01:17:21,721 --> 01:17:23,354
ONLY OTHER PLACE I'VE BEEN

1399
01:17:23,356 --> 01:17:25,656
PANTSLESS FIVE TIMES IS SIX

1400
01:17:25,658 --> 01:17:25,956
FLAGS.

1401
01:17:25,958 --> 01:17:27,892
>> OKAY, WELL, LET'S MOVE PAST

1402
01:17:27,894 --> 01:17:28,192
THAT.

1403
01:17:28,194 --> 01:17:29,260
NOW WHAT HAPPENED NEXT IN THE

1404
01:17:29,262 --> 01:17:30,461
UPPER PART OF THE SHIP?

1405
01:17:30,463 --> 01:17:33,964
>> WELL, THE SMART ALIENS BATHED

1406
01:17:33,966 --> 01:17:35,866
US IN THIS GLOWING LIQUID THAT

1407
01:17:35,868 --> 01:17:37,034
ERASED ALL MY PAIN.

1408
01:17:37,036 --> 01:17:38,636
MY BAD KNEE DIDN'T EVEN HURT.

1409
01:17:38,638 --> 01:17:41,472
I BUSTED IT A FEW YEARS BACK

1410
01:17:41,474 --> 01:17:43,107
PLAYING PAINT BALL.

1411
01:17:43,109 --> 01:17:47,078
COMPETITIVE.

1412
01:17:47,080 --> 01:17:48,746
>> I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU WINKED

1413
01:17:48,748 --> 01:17:50,748
AT ME AFTER SAYING THAT, BUT

1414
01:17:50,750 --> 01:17:52,016
LET'S CONTINUE.

1415
01:17:52,018 --> 01:17:53,718
WERE YOU ALSO BATHED IN THIS

1416
01:17:53,720 --> 01:17:55,152
LIGHT, SIR?

1417
01:17:55,154 --> 01:17:57,021
>> HUH, YES, MA'AM.

1418
01:17:57,023 --> 01:17:59,890
IT FELT BETTER THAN ANY DRUG,

1419
01:17:59,892 --> 01:18:00,624
INCLUDING THE ONES I'M ON RIGHT

1420
01:18:00,626 --> 01:18:05,062
NOW.

1421
01:18:05,064 --> 01:18:07,231
>> NOW THAT REALLY TWEAKS MY

1422
01:18:07,233 --> 01:18:09,633
CHEEKS BECAUSE DOWN IN STEERAGE,

1423
01:18:09,635 --> 01:18:11,168
THE MOOD WAS TENSE.

1424
01:18:11,170 --> 01:18:13,037
>> STEERAGE, WHAT DO YOU THINK

1425
01:18:13,039 --> 01:18:14,205
COULD HAVE CAUSED THIS REACTION?

1426
01:18:14,207 --> 01:18:16,307
>> WELL, BETWEEN YOU, ME AND

1427
01:18:16,309 --> 01:18:17,775
JESUS C., I THINK IT HAD THE

1428
01:18:17,777 --> 01:18:20,277
STATE OF MY DOWN THERE HAIR.

1429
01:18:20,279 --> 01:18:22,179
BECAUSE REMEMBER, I'M DONALD

1430
01:18:22,181 --> 01:18:23,380
DUCKING IT, OKAY?

1431
01:18:23,382 --> 01:18:25,516
SHIRT, NO PANTS.

1432
01:18:25,518 --> 01:18:28,486
SO I'M POKE KAY BOWL AND MY

1433
01:18:28,488 --> 01:18:30,154
SMOKY HOLE ARE OUT.

1434
01:18:30,156 --> 01:18:32,523
AND PUBICALLY SPEAKING, NATURE

1435
01:18:32,525 --> 01:18:33,858
HAS RECLAIMED THE EARTH.

1436
01:18:33,860 --> 01:18:35,793
LAST TIME I HAD A BRAZILIAN DOWN

1437
01:18:35,795 --> 01:18:36,827
THERE WAS 2002.

1438
01:18:36,829 --> 01:18:38,229
HIS NAME WAS DIEGO, AND HE GOT

1439
01:18:38,231 --> 01:18:43,434
STREP THROAT.

1440
01:18:43,436 --> 01:18:44,268
WHO MOWS THE LAWN IN WINTER, AM

1441
01:18:44,270 --> 01:18:50,274
I RIGHT?

1442
01:18:50,276 --> 01:18:51,842
>> AMEN.

1443
01:18:51,844 --> 01:18:54,278
>> NOT SAY AMEN TO THAT COUNTRY.

1444
01:18:54,280 --> 01:18:56,313
>> MRS. REPORTY, I'M FAILING TO

1445
01:18:56,315 --> 01:18:58,415
SEE WHAT YOUR UNKEMPT PRIVATE

1446
01:18:58,417 --> 01:19:01,118
AREA HAS TO DO WITH THE ALIENS'

1447
01:19:01,120 --> 01:19:01,485
DEMEANOR.

1448
01:19:01,487 --> 01:19:03,654
>> OKAY, MY THEORY IS THEY

1449
01:19:03,656 --> 01:19:08,526
THOUGHT IT WAS AN ANIMAL.

1450
01:19:08,528 --> 01:19:09,527
FIRST, THEY DIDN'T KNOW IF IT

1451
01:19:09,529 --> 01:19:10,294
WAS FRIENDLY.

1452
01:19:10,296 --> 01:19:10,995
SO THEY'RE CAUTIOUS.

1453
01:19:10,997 --> 01:19:13,197
THEY'RE GOING UP THE CABINET,

1454
01:19:13,199 --> 01:19:15,533
AND THEY'RE GOING -- AND THEN,

1455
01:19:15,535 --> 01:19:17,568
THEN, THE ALPHA COMES IN, AND HE

1456
01:19:17,570 --> 01:19:18,135
CHALLENGES IT, RIGHT.

1457
01:19:18,137 --> 01:19:26,343
HE GOES LIKE THIS.

1458
01:19:26,345 --> 01:19:27,044
HEHHHHH!

1459
01:19:27,046 --> 01:19:29,313
SO HE GIVES A THUMBS-UP LIKE

1460
01:19:29,315 --> 01:19:30,881
WE'RE GOOD, IT'S TAME.

1461
01:19:30,883 --> 01:19:32,850
AND WHOA, IT'S PLAY TIME.

1462
01:19:32,852 --> 01:19:37,321
AND ONE OF THEM COMES UP UNDER

1463
01:19:37,323 --> 01:19:41,859
IT, PUTS IT ON LIKE A WIG, AND

1464
01:19:41,861 --> 01:19:43,661
HE'S LIKE DOING FRAT COMEDY, AND

1465
01:19:43,663 --> 01:19:48,566
ANOTHER ONE, HE IS SO EXCITED,

1466
01:19:48,568 --> 01:19:50,634
HE IS WRESTLING WITH IT, LIKE

1467
01:19:50,636 --> 01:19:52,937
IT'S HIS BROTHER, PULLING ME ALL

1468
01:19:52,939 --> 01:19:54,772
AROUND THE ROOM.

1469
01:19:54,774 --> 01:19:55,673
SO I LOOK DOWN.

1470
01:19:55,675 --> 01:19:57,274
I SEE A GUY BETWEEN MY LEGS WITH

1471
01:19:57,276 --> 01:19:58,742
A SMILE ON HIS FACE.

1472
01:19:58,744 --> 01:19:59,176
I DON'T KNOW.

1473
01:19:59,178 --> 01:20:02,479
FIRST TIME FOR EVERYTHING.

1474
01:20:02,481 --> 01:20:03,314
>> AMEN.

1475
01:20:03,316 --> 01:20:04,315
>> OKAY, AGAIN, NOT A THING TO

1476
01:20:04,317 --> 01:20:07,751
SAY AMEN TO.

1477
01:20:07,753 --> 01:20:10,588
>> AND THIS GOES ON ABOUT 15

1478
01:20:10,590 --> 01:20:12,590
MINUTES UNTIL WHO COMES TO THE

1479
01:20:12,592 --> 01:20:14,625
DOOR BUT MY FRIGGING MOTHER,

1480
01:20:14,627 --> 01:20:15,059
COLLEEN SR.

1481
01:20:15,061 --> 01:20:15,392
>> YES.

1482
01:20:15,394 --> 01:20:16,126
WE ACTUALLY HAD SOME QUESTIONS

1483
01:20:16,128 --> 01:20:18,162
FOR HER AS WELL.

1484
01:20:18,164 --> 01:20:18,896
>> I'M HERE, I'M HERE, I'M HERE.

1485
01:20:30,409 --> 01:20:33,244
>> SORRY, SORRY, MY BATHROOM

1486
01:20:33,246 --> 01:20:34,578
BREAK TOOK LONGER THAN I

1487
01:20:34,580 --> 01:20:34,979
THOUGHT.

1488
01:20:34,981 --> 01:20:35,679
MY NUMBER ONE TURNED INTO A

1489
01:20:35,681 --> 01:20:41,819
NUMBER THREE.

1490
01:20:41,821 --> 01:20:43,520
>> MEGA MILL OF ALERT.

1491
01:20:43,522 --> 01:20:44,788
>> NOT.

1492
01:20:44,790 --> 01:20:46,690

US RAFFERTY GALS, WE ALWAYS

1497
01:20:52,231 --> 01:20:53,197
ATTRACTED THE FREAKS.

1498
01:20:53,199 --> 01:20:54,698
FOR YEARS I THOUGHT COLLEEN'S

1499
01:20:54,700 --> 01:20:56,533
FATHER WAS PART ALIEN, BUT IT

1500
01:20:56,535 --> 01:20:57,101
TURNS OUT HE WAS JUST

1501
01:20:57,103 --> 01:21:06,110
UNCIRCUMCISED.

1502
01:21:06,112 --> 01:21:08,612
>> AMEN.

1503
01:21:08,614 --> 01:21:10,447
>> PLEASE, STOP.

1504
01:21:10,449 --> 01:21:10,748
STOP.

1505
01:21:10,750 --> 01:21:14,952
>> ANY WAY, I STILL HAD MY PANTS

ON WHEN THEY TOOK ME, BUT THAT

1507
01:21:17,323 --> 01:21:20,090
WAS GOOD BECAUSE MUCH LIKE HER,

1508
01:21:20,092 --> 01:21:23,928
I GOT A INTO THE WOODS

1509
01:21:23,930 --> 01:21:24,295
SITUATION.

1510
01:21:24,297 --> 01:21:26,230
MY EX USED TO SAY THAT IT WAS

1511
01:21:26,232 --> 01:21:28,632
LIKE TRYING TO HACK HIS WAY

1512
01:21:28,634 --> 01:21:29,967
THROUGH THE BLACK FOREST.

1513
01:21:29,969 --> 01:21:30,434
>> OKAY.

1514
01:21:30,436 --> 01:21:31,068
>> OKAY.

1515
01:21:31,070 --> 01:21:33,971
>> I FEEL LIKE WE'RE OFF TRACK.

1516
01:21:33,973 --> 01:21:35,506
YOU SAID THAT AFTER ARRIVING ON

1517
01:21:35,508 --> 01:21:37,908
THE SHIP, THE ALIENS LOST

1518
01:21:37,910 --> 01:21:39,610
INTEREST AND, QUOTE, STUCK YOU

1519
01:21:39,612 --> 01:21:40,711
IN A CLOSET?

1520
01:21:40,713 --> 01:21:41,145
>> YEAH, YES.

1521
01:21:41,147 --> 01:21:44,715
CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT?

1522
01:21:44,717 --> 01:21:48,252
I MEAN, HEY, I'M USED TO BEING

1523
01:21:48,254 --> 01:21:50,120
STUFFED INTO THOSE CLOSETS, BUT

1524
01:21:50,122 --> 01:21:52,456
IT'S USUALLY WHEN THE GUY'S WIFE

1525
01:21:52,458 --> 01:21:57,361
COMES HOME LATER OR EARLIER OR

1526
01:21:57,363 --> 01:21:58,629

1535
01:22:26,325 --> 01:22:28,425
>> YEAH, WELL, A GOOD MOTHER CAN

1536
01:22:28,427 --> 01:22:29,960

HOW DID YOU ALL EXIT THE

1541
01:22:35,668 --> 01:22:38,702
SPACECRAFT?

1542
01:22:38,704 --> 01:22:41,138
>> THAT SAME SOFT LIGHT PICKED

1543
01:22:41,140 --> 01:22:43,273
ME UP AND PLACED ME BACK IN MY

1544
01:22:43,275 --> 01:22:43,574
BED.

>> AND HOW DID YOU TWO DEPART

1549
01:22:49,982 --> 01:22:52,249
THE SPACECRAFT?

1550
01:22:52,251 --> 01:22:53,917
>> WELL, IN THE PAST I'VE JUST

1551
01:22:53,919 --> 01:22:55,019
BEEN PUSHED OUT OF A HATCH, BUT

1552

01:23:05,765 --> 01:23:06,930
THEY'RE GONE.

1557
01:23:06,932 --> 01:23:08,966
