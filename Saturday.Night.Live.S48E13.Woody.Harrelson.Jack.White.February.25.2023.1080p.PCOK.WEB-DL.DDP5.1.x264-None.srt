1
00:00:02,057 --> 00:00:03,637
>>> YOU'RE WATCHING C-SPAN.

2
00:00:03,688 --> 00:00:07,308
UP NEXT, FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP
ADDRESSES RESIDENTS OF EAST PALESTINE, OHIO

3
00:00:07,308 --> 00:00:10,036
FOLLOWING THIS
MONTH'S TRAIN DERAILMENT.

4
00:00:15,334 --> 00:00:16,957
HELLO, EVERYONE.

5
00:00:16,957 --> 00:00:21,478
HELLO. IT'S WONDERFUL TO BE HERE IN THE
TOWN OF EAST PALESTINE,

6
00:00:21,478 --> 00:00:23,134
NOT A
GREAT NAME.

7
00:00:23,134 --> 00:00:27,117
BUT I HAD TO COME HERE AND SEE
THESE WONDERFUL PEOPLE

8
00:00:27,117 --> 00:00:29,986
WHO HAVE
BEEN ABANDONED BY BIDEN.

9
00:00:29,986 --> 00:00:32,686
HE'S ON SPRING BREAK IN UKRAINE

10
00:00:32,686 --> 00:00:36,894
WITH HIS FRIEND ZELENSKYY IN THE
T-SHIRT, VERY DISRESPECTFUL.

11
00:00:36,894 --> 00:00:41,896
ZELENSKYY THINKS HE'S ROCKING
THAT RINGADEE LIKE SCOTT PILGRIM.

12
00:00:41,896 --> 00:00:44,425
BUT I'M HERE, AND I BROUGHT HATS.

13
00:00:44,425 --> 00:00:48,211
CAMERAS AND HATS BECAUSE IT'S
TERRIBLE WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE.

14
00:00:48,211 --> 00:00:52,925
EARLIER TODAY, A FARMER CAME UP
TO ME, BIG FELLA,
AND HE SAID,

15
00:00:52,925 --> 00:00:57,288
SIR, WE HAVE NOTHING TO EAT
BECAUSE OUR DIRT IS POISON,

16
00:00:57,288 --> 00:01:01,715
AND
I SAID, WELL, WHAT ARE YOU DOING
EATING THE DIRT?
DON'T EAT THE DIRT, FOLKS.

17
00:01:01,715 --> 00:01:05,977
DON'T EAT THE DIRT.
YOU SHOULD BE EATING THE COLD
McDONALD'S I BROUGHT YOU,

18
00:01:05,977 --> 00:01:09,584
AND
TRUMP ICE.

19
00:01:09,584 --> 00:01:13,408
I'LL BE HONEST, I JUST PUT MY
STICKER ON SOME DASANI.

20
00:01:13,408 --> 00:01:16,462
WE LIKE TO SAY DASANI.

21
00:01:16,462 --> 00:01:19,580
I'VE HEARD ALL ABOUT YOUR
SITUATION WITH THE WATER,

22
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:22,804
BUT I
WAS LOOKING AT YOUR RIVER, AND
IT'S SO SHINY.

23
00:01:22,804 --> 00:01:25,649
I'VE NEVER SEEN WATER SO BEAUTIFUL.

24
00:01:25,649 --> 00:01:29,318
BEAUTIFUL RAINBOWS AND
DISCOLORATION.
IT'S GREAT.

25
00:01:29,318 --> 00:01:32,251
IT'S WEARING MAKEUP.
FENTY BEAUTY WATER.

26
00:01:32,251 --> 00:01:34,818
FENTY BY RIHANNA.

27
00:01:34,818 --> 00:01:39,426
BY THE WAY, SHE WAS PREGNANT
DOING SUPER BOWL.
CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT?

28
00:01:39,426 --> 00:01:42,311
I SAID, OF COURSE SHE IS.
SHE'S NOT MOVING AT ALL.

29
00:01:42,311 --> 00:01:46,872
SHE WAS JUST DOING ARMS THE
WHOLE TIME.

30
00:01:46,872 --> 00:01:49,140
BUT YOUR TRAIN EXPLODED.

31
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:53,693
AND WHO DO WE BLAME?
WHO DO WE BLAME?

32
00:01:53,693 --> 00:01:55,756
WE BLAME BUTTIGIEG.

33
00:01:55,756 --> 00:01:58,760
PETE BUTTIGIEG.

34
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,559
THIS WAS HIS RESPONSIBILITY.

35
00:02:00,559 --> 00:02:04,533
UNFORTUNATELY, HE WAS TOO BUSY
BEING A NERD AND BEING GAY

36
00:02:04,533 --> 00:02:08,507
TO
HAVE DEALT WITH THE VERY MUCH
MORE IMPORTANT ISSUE

37
00:02:08,507 --> 00:02:10,933
OF SHOULD
DRAINS HAVE BIG POISON.

38
00:02:10,933 --> 00:02:14,858
AND I HAVE TO TELL YOU, I CALL
HIM PETE BUTT.

39
00:02:14,858 --> 00:02:19,759
I CALL HIM PETE BUTT.
THERE'S NO WAY AROUND IT.
THAT'S JUST THE BEST ONE.

40
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:22,995
BELIEVE ME, I'VE TRIED IT EVERY
WHICH WAY,

41
00:02:22,995 --> 00:02:26,043
AND IT REALLY DOESN'T
GET BETTER THAN PETE BUTT.

42
00:02:26,043 --> 00:02:29,493
BUT THIS WOULD HAVE NEVER
HAPPENED UNDER MY
ADMINISTRATION.

43
00:02:29,493 --> 00:02:32,340
PEOPLE ARE SAYING I MADE THE
TRAINS LESS SAFE.

44
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:34,565
NOT TRUE.
OKAY?
NOT TRUE.

45
00:02:34,565 --> 00:02:37,654
I DID A LOT FOR TRAINS.
I MADE THEM BIGGER, FASTER,

46
00:02:37,654 --> 00:02:40,024
LESS SAFE PERHAPS, BUT

47
00:02:40,024 --> 00:02:44,240
I'M PAYING MY
RESPECTS BECAUSE YOUR TRAIN
EXPLODED

48
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:48,288
AND NOW YOUR BIRDS AND
FISH ARE ALL DEAD.

49
00:02:48,288 --> 00:02:52,100
WAKE UP IN THE MORNING AND NOT
HEAR THE BEAUTIFUL CHIRPING OF BIRDS

50
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:56,376
AND INSTEAD HEAR TRAINS
EXPLODING AND DERAILING ALL OVER
THE PLACE.

51
00:02:56,376 --> 00:02:59,029
YOUR TOWN IS HURTING.
THAT'S WHY YOU NEED ME.

52
00:02:59,029 --> 00:03:02,484
I FEEL LIKE I COULD "SCHITT'S
CREEK" THIS PLACE, RIGHT?

53
00:03:02,484 --> 00:03:07,375
BUT I NEED BIG EYEBROWS.

54
00:03:07,375 --> 00:03:11,858
YOU WATCH "SCHITT'S CREEK"?
NO, YOU GUYS WATCH YELLOW STONE.

55
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:13,685
THE DUTTONS.

56
00:03:13,685 --> 00:03:18,518
ANYWAY, I HAVE A SURPRISE GUEST
THIS WEEK.

57
00:03:18,519 --> 00:03:20,994
TV THIS WEEK

58
00:03:20,994 --> 00:03:24,926
IT'S THE FOREMAN OF THE GEORGIA
GRAND JURY INVESTIGATING ME.

59
00:03:24,926 --> 00:03:27,026
IT'S EMILY KOHRS.

60
00:03:27,026 --> 00:03:30,302
THIS IS SO COOL.

61
00:03:30,302 --> 00:03:32,592
FIRST GIULIANI AND NOW YOU.

62
00:03:32,593 --> 00:03:35,172
SIR

63
00:03:35,172 --> 00:03:37,493
SHE'S AN ODD DUCK, BUT WE
LIKE HER.

64
00:03:37,493 --> 00:03:41,180
SHE'S EITHER 70 OR 40, BUT WE
CAN'T TELL.

65
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:45,627
SHE'S GOT A BIG SECRET FOR SUCH
A LITTLE LADY.

66
00:03:45,627 --> 00:03:48,033
POTENTIALLY.

67
00:03:49,304 --> 00:03:51,093
I MIGHT.

68
00:03:51,708 --> 00:03:54,075
I DON'T KNOW.

69
00:03:55,488 --> 00:03:57,701
WE DON'T LIKE THAT.

70
00:03:57,701 --> 00:03:59,867
WE DON'T LIKE THAT SOUND.

71
00:03:59,973 --> 00:04:03,009
BECAUSE SHE KNOWS IF I'M GETTING
INDICTED.

72
00:04:04,859 --> 00:04:07,367
SHE'S HEAD JUROR, CAN YOU
BELIEVE THAT?

73
00:04:07,428 --> 00:04:08,600
THEY ELECTED HER.

74
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:11,389
THEY'LL ELECT ANYONE.
I STARTED THAT.

75
00:04:11,389 --> 00:04:14,046
SO COME ON, SPILL THE TEA.
COME ON.

76
00:04:14,046 --> 00:04:15,774
NOPE.

77
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:19,972
YOU JUST WANT ME TO RUIN THE CASE.

78
00:04:19,972 --> 00:04:25,417
BUT I GUESS I CAN SAY WE HAVE
BEEN SAYING YOUR NAME A LOT.

79
00:04:25,417 --> 00:04:28,194
CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT?
THEY ALMOST HAD ME,

80
00:04:28,194 --> 00:04:31,176
AND THEN
THIS LITTLE HORSE GIRL COMES IN
AND SAVES THE DAY.

81
00:04:31,176 --> 00:04:32,732
THANK YOU, EMILY.

82
00:04:32,732 --> 00:04:35,566
FAIR THEE WELL.

83
00:04:35,566 --> 00:04:38,017
DO WE LIKE HER?

84
00:04:38,017 --> 00:04:40,064
SHE LOOKS LIKE HALEY JOEL OSMENT,

85
00:04:40,064 --> 00:04:42,311
AND SHE'S MY BEST FRIEND.

86
00:04:42,311 --> 00:04:47,214
WELL, I'M GOING TO GET OUT OF
HERE SOON BECAUSE THE AIR IS
FULL OF POISON.

87
00:04:47,214 --> 00:04:49,815
BUT EVERYBODY IN OHIO ALWAYS ASKS ME,

88
00:04:49,815 --> 00:04:52,367
WHAT DO I DO NOW?
THERE'S POISON GAS IN THE AIR.

89
00:04:52,367 --> 00:04:56,457
COULD BE A GOOD THING.
I KNOW SOME OF THE HUSBANDS ARE HAPPY TO HAVE

90
00:04:56,457 --> 00:04:59,106
THE STINKY GAS AS
AN EXCUSE.

91
00:04:59,106 --> 00:05:04,630
- HONEY, DID YOU PASS GAS?
- NO, IT WAS THE TRAIN.

92
00:05:05,085 --> 00:05:07,573
BLAME THE TRAIN, RIGHT?

93
00:05:07,573 --> 00:05:11,844
YOU WOULD NORMALLY BLAME THE
DOG, BUT THEY'RE ALL DEAD NOW,
AREN'T THEY?

94
00:05:11,844 --> 00:05:14,294
SO IN CONCLUSION, "SCHITT'S CREEK,"

95
00:05:14,294 --> 00:05:17,150
RIHANNA, PETE BUTT,

96
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:20,970
AND LIVE FROM NEW YORK, IT'S
SATURDAY NIGHT!

97
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:28,535
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WOODY
HARRELSON!

98
00:07:47,445 --> 00:07:51,299
>>> THANK YOU.
THANK YOU VERY, VERY MUCH.

99
00:07:51,299 --> 00:07:55,024
HELLO, YOU BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE.

100
00:07:57,138 --> 00:08:00,688
AND YOU UGLY PEOPLE TOO.

101
00:08:00,688 --> 00:08:01,952
NO. I JEST.

102
00:08:02,001 --> 00:08:04,226
THIS COUNTRY SEEMS SO DIVIDED,

103
00:08:04,226 --> 00:08:08,713
BEAUTIFUL, UGLY, BLACK, WHITE, BLUE, RED,

104
00:08:08,713 --> 00:08:10,361
I LOVE EVERYBODY.

105
00:08:10,361 --> 00:08:13,899
MAYBE BECAUSE I'M A RED NECK HIPPY.

106
00:08:13,899 --> 00:08:18,128
YOU KNOW, THE RED IN ME THINKS
YOU SHOULDN'T BE ALLOWED TO OWN GUNS.

107
00:08:18,128 --> 00:08:22,038
THE BLUE IN ME THINKS, SQUIRT
GUNS.

108
00:08:22,038 --> 00:08:26,319
SO I'M RED AND BLUE, WHICH MAKES PURPLE.

109
00:08:27,098 --> 00:08:28,278
I'M PURPLE.

110
00:08:28,278 --> 00:08:33,089
SO THIS IS MY FIFTH TIME DOING SNL.

111
00:08:39,232 --> 00:08:42,712
WELL, AND YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS.

112
00:08:45,892 --> 00:08:48,984
NO JACKET. OKAY.

113
00:08:48,984 --> 00:08:54,141
THE LAST TIME I DID SNL WAS
AROUND THANKSGIVING 2019,

114
00:08:54,141 --> 00:08:55,503
THREE
YEARS AGO.

115
00:08:55,503 --> 00:08:58,878
AND YOU WOULD NOT BELIEVE WHAT
HAPPENED AFTER THE SHOW.

116
00:08:58,878 --> 00:09:01,344
THE NEXT DAY-- IT WAS A SUNDAY,

117
00:09:01,344 --> 00:09:05,450
AS IT ALWAYS IS THE DAY AFTER I
DO "SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE."

118
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:08,135
IT'S LIKE A PATTERN I NOTICED.

119
00:09:08,135 --> 00:09:13,402
ANYWAY, I WENT WALKING IN THE
GREATEST PART OF THIS CITY,
CENTRAL PARK,

120
00:09:13,506 --> 00:09:19,025
LEANED AGAINST A
TREE, AND STARTED TO READ THE
CRAZIEST SCRIPT.

121
00:09:19,025 --> 00:09:23,979
OKAY.
FULL DISCLOSURE, I SMOKED A
JOINT FIRST.

122
00:09:23,979 --> 00:09:26,720
THE REASON I LIKE HERB MORE THAN ALCOHOL

123
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:30,117
IS BECAUSE IT MAKES ME
FEEL GOOD, NO HANGOVER,

124
00:09:30,117 --> 00:09:33,344
AND I
NEVER WAKE UP COVERED IN BLOOD.

125
00:09:33,926 --> 00:09:38,704
BUT REGARDLESS, I HAVE DECIDED
TO QUIT SMOKING POT ALTOGETHER,

126
00:09:38,704 --> 00:09:40,669
AND I'M STICKING WITH IT--

127
00:09:40,669 --> 00:09:42,835
UNTIL AFTER THE SHOW.

128
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:48,342
YEAH.
LAST WEEK IN AUSTIN, I WAS
TALKING WITH MY FRIEND NICK.

129
00:09:48,342 --> 00:09:49,669
WE HAVE A LOT IN COMMON.

130
00:09:49,669 --> 00:09:53,401
HE WROTE "TRUE DETECTIVE" AND I
WAS IN "TRUE DETECTIVE."

131
00:09:53,401 --> 00:09:58,207
I'M VEGAN, AND ALL THE ANIMALS
HE EATS ARE VEGAN.

132
00:09:58,207 --> 00:10:02,705
ANYWAY, I WAS COMPLAINING ABOUT
HOW I START SMOKING AROUND NOON

133
00:10:02,705 --> 00:10:05,949
AND GET PROGRESSIVELY DUMBER AS
THE DAY UNFOLDS.

134
00:10:05,949 --> 00:10:11,836
FORGET BASIC WORDS, SIMPLE
OBJECTS E-T-CETERA.

135
00:10:11,836 --> 00:10:17,390
I WAS HOPING THE WIFE MIGHT SAY,
OH, NO, THAT'S NOT TRUE.

136
00:10:17,472 --> 00:10:21,570
INSTEAD SHE SAYS, AT LEAST
YOU'RE AWARE OF IT.

137
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:25,764
AND I SAY, WELL THAT DOESN'T
FEEL LIKE MUCH CONSOLATION.

138
00:10:25,764 --> 00:10:30,015
AND SHE SAYS, THINK OF ALL THE
DUMB PEOPLE WHO DON'T KNOW
THEY'RE DUMB.

139
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:31,886
YOU'RE AHEAD OF THEM.

140
00:10:32,608 --> 00:10:34,552
THANKS, HON.

141
00:10:34,552 --> 00:10:40,399
BUT ON TOP OF THE HERB, I'M A
WEE BIT OF A DRINKER.

142
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:43,595
I DON'T KNOW WHY I WENT IRISH THERE.
ANYWAY,

143
00:10:43,595 --> 00:10:47,502
BUT IN A PERSONAL
TRIUMPH, LAST YEAR,

144
00:10:47,575 --> 00:10:51,464
I HAD SEVEN
MONTHS WITH NO ALCOHOL,

145
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:57,926
AND FIVE
GLORIOUS MONTHS.

146
00:10:57,926 --> 00:11:00,936
ANYWAY, WHAT WERE WE TALKING
ABOUT?

147
00:11:01,037 --> 00:11:04,103
OH, YEAH.
I WAS TELLING YOU ABOUT THAT SCRIPT.

148
00:11:04,103 --> 00:11:09,856
SO I BLAZE A FATTY, WHICH, YOU
KNOW, I GOT IN LA

149
00:11:09,856 --> 00:11:12,071
AT MY
DISPENSARY, THE WOODS.

150
00:11:12,071 --> 00:11:18,570
I MEAN, OBVIOUSLY, I DIDN'T
TRANSPORT THE HERB FROM
CALIFORNIA TO NEW YORK

151
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:21,598
BECAUSE
THAT'S HIGHLY ILLEGAL.

152
00:11:21,598 --> 00:11:25,785
MY MANAGER, JEREMY, DID. YEAH.

153
00:11:25,785 --> 00:11:29,156
HE MULED IT FROM LA.

154
00:11:29,256 --> 00:11:32,816
YEAH. SPEAKING OF JEREMY, HE'S HERE
TONIGHT.

155
00:11:32,816 --> 00:11:40,290
BROUGHT

156
00:11:42,775 --> 00:11:47,395
NEWLY SINGLE, LADIES.
VERY HANDSOME.

157
00:11:47,395 --> 00:11:52,545
I KNOW HE WOULD PREFER I TALK
ABOUT OUR MOVIE "CHAMPIONS"

158
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:55,365
THAT'S COMING OUT IN TWO WEEKS.

159
00:11:57,489 --> 00:12:01,752
COMEDIC MASTERPIECE, BUT I'M NOT
HERE TO SELL "CHAMPIONS."

160
00:12:01,752 --> 00:12:03,388
IT SELLS ITSELF.

161
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:07,601
PROJECTIONS HAVE IT MAKING MORE
THAN "AVATAR",

162
00:12:07,601 --> 00:12:10,604
BUT WHATEVER, I'M
NO SALESMAN.

163
00:12:10,604 --> 00:12:12,719
WHERE WAS I?
OKAY.

164
00:12:12,804 --> 00:12:14,829
SO THREE YEARS AGO, CENTRAL PARK,

165
00:12:14,829 --> 00:12:17,503
SUNDAY MORNING, THE LORD'S DAY,

166
00:12:17,503 --> 00:12:22,456
TRYING TO RESIST THE
TEMPTATION TO PUFF TOO EARLY IN
THE DAY.

167
00:12:22,456 --> 00:12:24,975
OF COURSE, I SUCCUMB.

168
00:12:24,975 --> 00:12:28,444
LIKE A LOT OF PEOPLE, I HAVE A
DEVIL ON ONE SHOULDER,

169
00:12:28,444 --> 00:12:33,375
AND ON
THE OTHER SHOULDER, I HAVE A
LARGER, MORE FRIGHTENING DEVIL.

170
00:12:33,375 --> 00:12:36,417
AND THERE'S A BATTLE GOING ON IN
HERE.

171
00:12:36,417 --> 00:12:40,105
I'M JUST SAYING I AM MANY
DIFFERENT THINGS,

172
00:12:40,105 --> 00:12:43,161
ANARCHIST, MARKIST,

173
00:12:43,162 --> 00:12:47,644
ETHICAL HEDONIST,
NONDISCRIMINATORY EMPATH,

174
00:12:47,644 --> 00:12:50,993
EPISTEMOLOGY DECONSTRUCTIONIST,

175
00:12:50,993 --> 00:12:53,134
A TEXAN.

176
00:12:54,193 --> 00:12:57,434
BUT BACK TO THE TREE IN CENTRAL
PARK AND THAT SCRIPT.

177
00:12:57,434 --> 00:12:59,653
PUT YOURSELF IN MY PLACE,

178
00:12:59,653 --> 00:13:03,640
LAY THE CURVE OF YOUR NECK AGAINST
THE ROOTS OF THE TREE.

179
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:07,659
WHAT KIND OF TREE WAS IT?
WHAT KIND DO THEY HAVE IN
CENTRAL PARK?

180
00:13:07,659 --> 00:13:10,101
OH, YEAH, IT WAS A PALM TREE.

181
00:13:10,101 --> 00:13:13,491
LAY YOUR HEAD AGAINST THE PALM,

182
00:13:13,491 --> 00:13:17,192
FIRE UP THE HOOTER FROM JEREMY,

183
00:13:17,192 --> 00:13:19,515
AND START READING.

184
00:13:19,515 --> 00:13:22,281
SO THE MOVIE GOES LIKE THIS,

185
00:13:22,281 --> 00:13:26,298
THE BIGGEST DRUG CARTELS IN THE
WORLD GET TOGETHER

186
00:13:26,298 --> 00:13:29,544
AND BUY UP
ALL THE MEDIA AND ALL THE POLITICIANS

187
00:13:29,544 --> 00:13:33,404
AND FORCE ALL THE
PEOPLE IN THE WORLD TO STAY
LOCKED IN THEIR HOMES,

188
00:13:33,404 --> 00:13:37,827
AND
PEOPLE CAN ONLY COME OUT IF THEY
TAKE THE CARTEL'S DRUGS

189
00:13:37,827 --> 00:13:40,767
AND KEEP
TAKING THEM OVER AND OVER.

190
00:13:40,767 --> 00:13:42,821
I THREW THE SCRIPT AWAY.

191
00:13:42,821 --> 00:13:46,147
I MEAN, WHO WAS GOING TO BELIEVE
THAT CRAZY IDEA?

192
00:13:46,147 --> 00:13:48,633
BEING FORCED TO DO DRUGS?

193
00:13:48,633 --> 00:13:52,135
I DO THAT VOLUNTARILY ALL DAY
LONG.

194
00:13:52,135 --> 00:13:55,940
ANYWAY, IT'S ABOUT THAT TIME.

195
00:13:58,227 --> 00:14:00,354
STILL NO JACKET.
OKAY.

196
00:14:00,354 --> 00:14:04,082
WELL, WE GOT A GREAT SHOW FOR
YOU TONIGHT.

197
00:14:04,082 --> 00:14:06,794
HERE, WE|LL BE BACK

198
00:14:17,057 --> 00:14:29,235
>>> ALL RIGHT, 6117, YOU GOT

199
00:14:17,057 --> 00:14:29,235
FIVE MINUTES.

200
00:14:17,057 --> 00:14:29,235
CARLA JEAN, GOD, IT'S SO GOOD

201
00:14:29,235 --> 00:14:35,909
TO SEE YOUR FACE.

202
00:14:29,235 --> 00:14:35,909
I MISS YOU TOO, WILLY.

203
00:14:29,235 --> 00:14:35,909
LOOK, I KNOW I MADE A DAMN

204
00:14:35,909 --> 00:14:40,947
MESS OF THING ON THE OUTSIDE,

205
00:14:35,909 --> 00:14:40,947
BUT I SWEAR I'VE CHANGED.

206
00:14:35,909 --> 00:14:40,947
I HOPE SO.

207
00:14:40,947 --> 00:14:46,553
I'M TIRED OF COMING HERE, WILLY,

208
00:14:40,947 --> 00:14:46,553
I REALLY AM.

209
00:14:40,947 --> 00:14:46,553
I KNOW, HONEY.

210
00:14:46,553 --> 00:14:50,323

YOU HEAR ME?

213
00:14:50,323 --> 00:14:55,995
I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU THE LIFE

214
00:14:50,323 --> 00:14:55,995
YOU'VE ALWAYS DESERVED.

215
00:14:50,323 --> 00:14:55,995
MARK MY WORDS, I'M GOING TO BE

216
00:14:55,995 --> 00:15:00,500
OUT OF HERE SOON.

217
00:14:55,995 --> 00:15:00,500
NO HE NOT.

218
00:14:55,995 --> 00:15:00,500
WHAT WAS THAT?

219
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:06,039
YOU SAY WHATEVER YOU WANT.

220
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:06,039
THAT'S YOUR CONVERSATION.

221
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:06,039
LISTEN HERE, CARLA JEAN.

222
00:15:06,039 --> 00:15:09,509
YOU REMEMBER THAT HOUSE ON

223
00:15:06,039 --> 00:15:09,509
CHERRY LANE, THE ONE WITH THE

224
00:15:06,039 --> 00:15:09,509
WHITE PICKET FENCE?

225
00:15:09,509 --> 00:15:16,049
WHEN I GET OUT OF HERE, I'M

226
00:15:09,509 --> 00:15:16,049
GOING TO BUY US THAT HOUSE.

227
00:15:09,509 --> 00:15:16,049
WHEW, IN TODAY'S MARKET?

228
00:15:16,049 --> 00:15:20,053
THAT IS FUNNY.

229
00:15:16,049 --> 00:15:20,053
I'M SORRY.

230
00:15:16,049 --> 00:15:20,053
IS THERE A PROBLEM?

231
00:15:20,053 --> 00:15:26,559
SEEM TO ME LIKE YOU WANT ONE.

232
00:15:20,053 --> 00:15:26,559
LEAVE ME OUT OF THIS.

233
00:15:20,053 --> 00:15:26,559
ALL Y'ALL GET ON MY DAMN NERVES.

234
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:32,165
THIS MAN SAY HE'S GOING TO BUY

235
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:32,165
HER A HOUSE.

236
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:32,165
BUY A HOUSE.

237
00:15:32,165 --> 00:15:37,804
YOU KNOW, CARLA JEAN,

238
00:15:32,165 --> 00:15:37,804
PRISON'S BEEN GOOD FOR ME.

239
00:15:32,165 --> 00:15:37,804

I'M READING A LOT.

241
00:15:37,804 --> 00:15:46,546
SAY HE WANT TO BUY A HOUSE.

242
00:15:37,804 --> 00:15:46,546
I'M EVEN GOING TO GET MY GED.

243
00:15:46,546 --> 00:15:52,719
I CAN'T BUY A HOUSE, AND I'M

244
00:15:46,546 --> 00:15:52,719
NOT IN JAIL.

245
00:15:46,546 --> 00:15:52,719
I RENT A ONE-BEDROOM APARTMENT

246
00:15:52,719 --> 00:15:58,425
WITH A ROOMMATE.

247
00:15:52,719 --> 00:15:58,425
ALWAYS SEEING HAIR ON MY BAR OF

248
00:15:52,719 --> 00:15:58,425
SOAP, AND NOT FROM HER HEAD

249
00:15:58,425 --> 00:16:01,261
EITHER.

250
00:15:58,425 --> 00:16:01,261
WANT TO BUY A HOUSE.

251
00:15:58,425 --> 00:16:01,261
I HAD A HOUSE.

252
00:16:01,261 --> 00:16:06,766
EX-BOYFRIEND CAUGHT IT ON FIRE.

253
00:16:01,261 --> 00:16:06,766

254
00:16:01,261 --> 00:16:06,766
I'M TRYING TO TALK TO MY WIFE.

255
00:16:06,766 --> 00:16:11,504
THAT'S YOUR WIFE?

256
00:16:06,766 --> 00:16:11,504
Y'ALL STILL MARRIED?

257

00:18:04,017 --> 00:18:08,021
HOUSE?

316
00:18:04,017 --> 00:18:08,021
HOW HE GOING TO BUY A HOUSE.

317
00:18:08,021 --> 00:18:16,229
OUT THERE WITH THE DAMN

318
00:18:08,021 --> 00:18:16,229
CHUCKY, GOT THE AC ALL JACKED

319
00:18:08,021 --> 00:18:16,229
UP, LISTENING TO CLUB RAP, YOU

320
00:18:16,229 --> 00:18:22,469
KNOW THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT CARS.

321
00:18:16,229 --> 00:18:22,469
THEY GOT ME AS SOON AS I PAY

322
00:18:16,229 --> 00:18:22,469
OFF SOME OF THAT--

323
00:18:22,469 --> 00:18:29,476
YOU KNOW WHAT I SHOULD DO, GO

324
00:18:22,469 --> 00:18:29,476
IN ON A TIMESHARE.

325
00:18:22,469 --> 00:18:29,476
THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING

326
00:18:29,476 --> 00:18:31,478
ABOUT.

327
00:18:29,476 --> 00:18:31,478
THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING. OKAY.

328
00:18:31,478 --> 00:18:36,149
I GUESS I'M JUST GOING TO GO.

329
00:18:31,478 --> 00:18:36,149
YEAH, I'LL JUST HEAD BACK TO

330
00:18:31,478 --> 00:18:36,149
THE JAIL.

331
00:18:36,149 --> 00:18:42,822
GO ON AHEAD, MAN.

332
00:18:36,149 --> 00:18:42,822
TALKING ABOUT ANOTHER CHUCKY

333
00:18:36,149 --> 00:18:42,822
WITH RED HAIR.

334
00:18:52,226 --> 00:18:55,337
>>> FELLAS, WHAT ARE WE UP TO
TONIGHT?

335
00:18:55,434 --> 00:18:58,054
YOU GUYS COMING OVER, PLAYING
TONY HAWK?

336
00:18:58,054 --> 00:19:00,524
- I'M BUSY TONIGHT.
- I'M TIRED TONIGHT.

337
00:19:00,568 --> 00:19:01,535
YOU'RE BUSY AND YOU'RE TIRED?

338
00:19:01,535 --> 00:19:04,858
- MAYBE TOMORROW.
- OH, YEAH.
COOL.
NO SWEAT.

339
00:19:04,858 --> 00:19:07,079
NEXT TIME.

340
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:11,602
HEY, MAN.
EVERYBODY OKAY WITH YOU AND YOUR
LITTLE FRIENDS?

341
00:19:11,602 --> 00:19:14,898
I DON'T KNOW.
I'M KIND OF WORRIED THEY'RE
HANGING OUT WITHOUT ME.

342
00:19:15,004 --> 00:19:18,133
DO YOU THINK WE SHOULD MAYBE
FOLLOW THEM, FIND OUT?

343
00:19:18,133 --> 00:19:20,615
FOLLOW THEM?
YOU DON'T MEAN A--

344
00:19:20,615 --> 00:19:24,569
YEAH.
A STAKEOUT.

345
00:19:30,111 --> 00:19:33,201
WHAT ARE THEY DOING OUT HERE
IN THE SUBURBS?

346
00:19:33,201 --> 00:19:35,735
WHO'S HOUSE IS THIS?

347
00:19:37,627 --> 00:19:41,138
WOW, DUDE.
I'M GOING TO TEXT THEM.

348
00:19:41,702 --> 00:19:44,273
- WHO'S THAT?
- BEN.

349
00:19:45,646 --> 00:19:48,144
DID HE JUST THROW HIS PHONE
AWAY?

350
00:19:48,212 --> 00:19:50,661
THAT'S A LOW BLOW, MAN.

351
00:19:50,661 --> 00:19:53,572
WELL, TIME TO GO IN THERE AND
KILL THEM?

352
00:19:53,572 --> 00:19:54,717
NO, MAN.
WHAT?

353
00:19:54,717 --> 00:19:56,045
WE'LL MAKE IT LOOK LIKE A
ROBBERY.

354
00:19:56,045 --> 00:19:58,150
JESUS, DUDE.
THAT'S NOT WHY WE'RE HERE.

355
00:19:58,150 --> 00:20:00,795
I'M JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT
WHY THEY BAILED ON ME.

356
00:20:00,795 --> 00:20:03,353
WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THEM?

357
00:20:04,525 --> 00:20:06,299
THEY LOOK REALLY COZY.

358
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:08,688
THIS IS REALLY NICE.

359
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:17,053
ARE THEY TOGETHER?

360
00:20:18,002 --> 00:20:19,606
WHAT?

361
00:20:19,606 --> 00:20:21,703
ALL RIGHT.
SHOULD WE HEAD OUT?

362
00:20:21,703 --> 00:20:23,404
WE'RE NOT DONE, MAN.

363
00:20:23,404 --> 00:20:25,051
OH, MY GOD.

364
00:20:25,051 --> 00:20:27,793
THEY'VE GOT A BABY TOO.

365
00:20:27,793 --> 00:20:28,909
KNOWN

366
00:20:28,909 --> 00:20:32,291
- KIDS, DINO NUGGETS ARE READY.
- FAVORITE.

367
00:20:32,291 --> 00:20:34,011
THEY HAVE A FAMILY?

368
00:20:34,011 --> 00:20:37,290
UH-OH, AND ONE MOODY TEEN.

369
00:20:37,290 --> 00:20:38,353
DINO NUGGETS AGAIN?

370
00:20:38,353 --> 00:20:41,226
OKAY, MISTER, I WORKED VERY
HARD.

371
00:20:41,226 --> 00:20:43,333
HONEY, RADICAL ACCEPTANCE.

372
00:20:43,333 --> 00:20:44,336
THIS IS INSANE.

373
00:20:44,336 --> 00:20:48,557
IT'S 2015.
IT'S NOT INSANE TO BE GAY.

374
00:20:48,557 --> 00:20:50,966
IT'S NOT 2015, MAN.

375
00:20:51,043 --> 00:20:52,749
AND I'M NOT MAD THEY'RE GAY.

376
00:20:52,749 --> 00:20:56,048
I'M MAD ABOUT THIS SECRET
BEAUTIFUL LIFE THEY NEVER TOLD
ME ABOUT.

377
00:20:56,048 --> 00:20:58,125
MAYBE THEY'RE SCARED TO TELL ANYONE.

378
00:20:58,126 --> 00:20:59,817
KISS

379
00:20:59,817 --> 00:21:02,105
KIDS, UNCLE KENAN IS HERE.

380
00:21:02,106 --> 00:21:04,191
UNCLE

381
00:21:04,191 --> 00:21:08,218
I'M GOING TO TEXT HIM BECAUSE
KENAN WOULDN'T LIE TO ME.

382
00:21:11,381 --> 00:21:14,158
THEY CAN'T JUST KEEP THROWING
THEIR PHONES AWAY.

383
00:21:14,158 --> 00:21:16,896
YOU NEVER SAW ANY SIGNS OF
THIS IN THE PAST?

384
00:21:16,962 --> 00:21:19,343
NOT THAT I REMEMBER.

385
00:21:19,343 --> 00:21:22,853
WE WOULD ALWAYS JUST HANG OUT
AND LAUGH TOGETHER.

386
00:21:22,853 --> 00:21:26,451
MAYBE THEY WERE JUST AFRAID TO
TELL ME BECAUSE THEY'RE AFRAID
TO HURT ME.

387
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:29,849
THEY CAN'T RISK LOSING ME
BECAUSE THEY LOVE ME TOO MUCH.

388
00:21:29,849 --> 00:21:32,561
ARE YOU SURE?

389
00:21:32,561 --> 00:21:34,666
WHERE DID THEY EVEN GET THAT?

390
00:21:34,666 --> 00:21:37,808
COME ON, KIDS.
TIME FOR BED.
WE GOT WORK TO DO.

391
00:21:37,808 --> 00:21:38,973
WHAT WORK?

392
00:21:38,973 --> 00:21:40,945
NEXT

393
00:21:40,945 --> 00:21:43,734
LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE DOING
AUDITIONS TO REPLACE YOU.

394
00:21:43,735 --> 00:21:46,256
HAIRCUT

395
00:21:46,256 --> 00:21:47,198
WAIT

396
00:21:47,198 --> 00:21:49,534
I'M GOING IN THERE.

397
00:21:50,698 --> 00:21:52,867
AND SATURDAYS, YOU'RE
AVAILABLE BECAUSE--

398
00:21:52,867 --> 00:21:54,692
BEN--
IT'S NOT WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE.

399
00:21:54,692 --> 00:21:56,477
THEN TELL ME WHAT IT IS.

400
00:21:56,477 --> 00:22:00,509
JOHN AND I HAVE A SECRET
FAMILY, AND WE'RE HOLDING
AUDITIONS TO REPLACE YOU.

401
00:22:00,575 --> 00:22:03,359
THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT IT WAS.

402
00:22:04,268 --> 00:22:08,102
THIS IS INSANE, MAN.
WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?

403
00:22:08,102 --> 00:22:10,277
YOU'RE RIGHT, MAN.

404
00:22:10,277 --> 00:22:14,018
WHAT ARE WE DOING?
WE SHOULDN'T BE HOLDING
AUDITIONS TO REPLACE HIM

405
00:22:14,018 --> 00:22:17,364
BECAUSE
THERE'S ONLY ONE YOU.

406
00:22:17,365 --> 00:22:18,227
WHAT

407
00:22:18,227 --> 00:22:20,180
DO

408
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:22,030
ONLY

409
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:25,234
AND YOU ARE IRREPLACEABLE.

410
00:22:25,234 --> 00:22:27,077
RIGHT, BEN?

411
00:22:27,077 --> 00:22:30,531
THANKS, GUYS.
BAD BOYS FOR LIFE.

412
00:22:30,531 --> 00:22:34,122
MAN, I FEEL LIKE WE'RE BACK AT NYU.

413
00:22:34,122 --> 00:22:36,116
OH, MY GOD, DUDE.
SO MUCH BETTER THAN BEN.

414
00:22:36,116 --> 00:22:38,710
HE'S THE PERFECT REPLACEMENT.

415
00:22:43,848 --> 00:22:47,834
>>> OH, MAN, HERE WE ARE, Y'ALL.

416
00:22:41,127 --> 00:22:47,834
COME ON.

417
00:22:41,127 --> 00:22:47,834
Y'ALL WANT TO DO THE SLINGSHOT?

418
00:22:47,834 --> 00:22:51,571
LOOK AT THIS THING, IT'S SO HIGH.

419
00:22:47,834 --> 00:22:51,571
MAN, THAT'S WAY UP THERE.

420
00:22:51,571 --> 00:22:54,941
COME ON.

421
00:22:51,571 --> 00:22:54,941
IT'S NOT THAT HIGH.

422
00:22:51,571 --> 00:22:54,941
LET DO IT.

423
00:22:54,941 --> 00:22:57,977
WHO'S COMING?

424
00:22:54,941 --> 00:22:57,977
YOU KNOW I CAN'T GET ON THAT THING.

425
00:22:57,977 --> 00:23:00,947
I GET TOO SCARED.

426
00:22:57,977 --> 00:23:00,947
COME ON.

427
00:22:57,977 --> 00:23:00,947
PLEASE?

428
00:23:00,947 --> 00:23:06,152
SAM WILL GO WITH YOU.

429
00:23:00,947 --> 00:23:06,152
COME ON, SAMMY.

430
00:23:00,947 --> 00:23:06,152
YOU CAN'T PUNK OUT IN FRONT OF

431
00:23:06,152 --> 00:23:11,224
YOUR GIRL.

432
00:23:06,152 --> 00:23:11,224
YEAH, SAM.

433
00:23:06,152 --> 00:23:11,224
HE NEEDS A PARTNER.

434
00:23:11,224 --> 00:23:15,228
YOU'RE BRAVE, RIGHT?

435
00:23:11,224 --> 00:23:15,228
I GUESS.

436
00:23:11,224 --> 00:23:15,228
GENTLEMEN, READY TO FLY?

437
00:23:15,228 --> 00:23:19,199
WE'RE CLEAR FOR TAKEOFF.

438
00:23:15,228 --> 00:23:19,199
YOU THINK THIS THING'S SAFE,

439
00:23:15,228 --> 00:23:19,199
RIGHT?

440
00:23:19,199 --> 00:23:24,404
OF COURSE.

441
00:23:19,199 --> 00:23:24,404
JUST SHOOTS YOU UP 400 FEET IN

442
00:23:19,199 --> 00:23:24,404
THREE SECONDS.

443
00:23:24,404 --> 00:23:27,974
NO PROBLEM, RIGHT?

444
00:23:24,404 --> 00:23:27,974
SOUNDS GOOD TO ME. YEAH.

445
00:23:27,974 --> 00:23:33,713
JUST TEN Gs RIGHT IN YOUR FACE.

446
00:23:27,974 --> 00:23:33,713
HOPE YOU'RE OKAY WITH THAT.

447
00:23:27,974 --> 00:23:33,713
DOESN'T BOTHER ME AT ALL.

448
00:23:33,713 --> 00:23:36,683
I'M A VETERAN.

449
00:23:33,713 --> 00:23:36,683
I WAS IN THE AIR FORCE.

450
00:23:33,713 --> 00:23:36,683
LOVE THAT.

451
00:23:36,683 --> 00:23:40,487
I WANT TO GET OFF.

452
00:23:36,683 --> 00:23:40,487
IT'S TOO LATE FOR THAT, SAMMY.

453
00:23:40,487 --> 00:23:45,658
I REALLY, REALLY WANT TO GET OFF.

454
00:23:40,487 --> 00:23:45,658
HE CAN'T HEAR YOU, MAN.

455
00:23:45,658 --> 00:23:48,762
JUST GET READY FOR THE COUNTDOWN.

456
00:23:45,658 --> 00:23:48,762
ALL RIGHT.

457
00:23:48,762 --> 00:23:55,402
IT'S HAPPENING IN THREE, TWO--

458
00:23:48,762 --> 00:23:55,402
AHH!

459
00:23:48,762 --> 00:23:55,402
OH, MY GOD, JESUS!

460
00:23:55,402 --> 00:24:00,440
THIS IS SO HIGH!

461
00:23:55,402 --> 00:24:00,440
WHOO!

462
00:23:55,402 --> 00:24:00,440
IT'S LIKE WE'RE BIRDS.

463
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:07,047
HEY, KEVIN, I THINK I CAN SEE MY

464
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:07,047
HOUSE!

465
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:07,047
KEVIN, YOU SEE IT?

466
00:24:07,047 --> 00:24:16,056
I GOT IT-- HEY, HEY!

467
00:24:07,047 --> 00:24:16,056
HEY, MAN, YOU PASS OUT?

468
00:24:16,056 --> 00:24:18,658
KEVIN?

469
00:24:16,056 --> 00:24:18,658
?

470
00:24:16,056 --> 00:24:18,658
OH, MY GOD, DID YOU SEE HOW FAST

471
00:24:18,658 --> 00:24:21,695
THEY WEREN'T.

472
00:24:18,658 --> 00:24:21,695
IT WAS SO INSANE.

473
00:24:18,658 --> 00:24:21,695
HERE THEY COME.

474
00:24:21,695 --> 00:24:26,766
HEY, YOU'RE ALIVE.

475
00:24:21,695 --> 00:24:26,766
HOW WAS IT?

476
00:24:21,695 --> 00:24:26,766
CRAZY.

477
00:24:26,766 --> 00:24:30,970
I CAN'T BELIEVE I DID THAT.

478
00:24:26,766 --> 00:24:30,970
THEY SHOOT YOU UP SO HIGH.

479
00:24:26,766 --> 00:24:30,970
THAT WAS PRETTY WILD.

480
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:36,776
SO WAS IT FUN?

481
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:36,776
OH, ACTUALLY, IT WAS.

482
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:36,776
I MEAN, THAT WAS A

483
00:24:36,776 --> 00:24:40,480
ONCE-IN-A-LIFETIME EXPERIENCE.

484
00:24:36,776 --> 00:24:40,480
IT SURE WAS.

485
00:24:36,776 --> 00:24:40,480
LET GO ON AND GET IN THE CAR

486
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:43,249
NOW.

487
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:43,249
YOU KNOW WHAT, KEVIN, I'LL DO IT.

488
00:24:43,249 --> 00:24:48,355
OH, YOU WANT TO DO IT?

489
00:24:43,249 --> 00:24:48,355
YOU'LL DO IT WITH ME, RIGHT,

490
00:24:43,249 --> 00:24:48,355
BABY?

491
00:24:48,355 --> 00:24:50,223
OF COURSE.

492
00:24:48,355 --> 00:24:50,223
GO, GIRL.

493
00:24:48,355 --> 00:24:50,223
I LOVE IT.

494
00:24:50,223 --> 00:24:52,759
I CAN'T BELIEVE WE'RE DOING THIS.

495
00:24:50,223 --> 00:24:52,759
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT NEITHER.

496
00:24:52,759 --> 00:24:56,763
GLAD TO HAVE YOU BACK.

497
00:24:52,759 --> 00:24:56,763
LOOKS LIKE WE GOT A RETURN CUSTOMER.

498
00:24:56,763 --> 00:25:00,834
VERY BRAVE.

499
00:24:56,763 --> 00:25:00,834
YEAH, YEAH.

500
00:24:56,763 --> 00:25:00,834
HEY, MAN, CAN WE GO UP REAL SOFT

501
00:25:00,834 --> 00:25:05,772
AND COME DOWN REAL GENTLE LIKE.

502
00:25:00,834 --> 00:25:05,772
NO CAN DO.

503
00:25:00,834 --> 00:25:05,772
THIS THING HAS ONLY ONE SPEED.

504
00:25:05,772 --> 00:25:10,143
BABY, WE'RE GOING TO BE OKAY,

505
00:25:05,772 --> 00:25:10,143
RIGHT?

506
00:25:05,772 --> 00:25:10,143
I WANT TO SAY YES.

507
00:25:10,143 --> 00:25:13,913
I GUESS WE JUST GOT TO WAIT FOR

508
00:25:10,143 --> 00:25:13,913
THE COUNTDOWN.

509
00:25:10,143 --> 00:25:13,913
ALL RIGHT.

510
00:25:13,913 --> 00:25:21,054
HERE WE GO.

511
00:25:13,913 --> 00:25:21,054
IN THREE, TWO-- AHH!

512
00:25:13,913 --> 00:25:21,054
AHH!

513
00:25:21,054 --> 00:25:27,193
OH, KEVIN!

514
00:25:21,054 --> 00:25:27,193
KEVIN, YOU OKAY, BABY?

515
00:25:21,054 --> 00:25:27,193
OH, MY GOD, TALK TO ME!

516
00:25:27,193 --> 00:25:32,065
I'M PASSING OUT-- I'M

517
00:25:27,193 --> 00:25:32,065
PASSING OUT!

518
00:25:27,193 --> 00:25:32,065
YOU WERE IN THE AIR FORCE.

519
00:25:32,065 --> 00:25:36,369
OH, YES, YES.

520
00:25:32,065 --> 00:25:36,369
I WAS ONLY PAINTING THE PLANES, THOUGH.

521
00:25:36,369 --> 00:25:40,373
KEVIN, JUST CALM DOWN.

522
00:25:36,369 --> 00:25:40,373
BABY, I LOST MY JOB THREE

523
00:25:36,369 --> 00:25:40,373
WEEKS AGO.

524
00:25:40,373 --> 00:25:46,880
YOU LOST YOUR JOB?

525
00:25:40,373 --> 00:25:46,880
OH, MY GOODNESS.

526
00:25:40,373 --> 00:25:46,880
I'M 17 YEARS OLDER TOO BY THE

527
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:50,083
WAY.

528
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:50,083
I THOUGHT YOUR DADDY WAS GOING

529
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:50,083
TO TELL YOU.

530
00:25:50,083 --> 00:25:58,792
WHAT?

531
00:25:50,083 --> 00:25:58,792
KEVIN!

532
00:25:50,083 --> 00:25:58,792
I'M PEEING.

533
00:25:58,792 --> 00:26:04,130
I'M PEEING ON EVERYTHING, ALL

534
00:25:58,792 --> 00:26:04,130
OVER THE PLACE, HONEY.

535
00:25:58,792 --> 00:26:04,130
OH, GET ME OUT OF HERE!

536
00:26:04,130 --> 00:26:08,702
YOU KNOW WHAT, I WANT TO DO IT.

537
00:26:04,130 --> 00:26:08,702
OH, GOOD.

538
00:26:08,702 --> 00:26:12,439
KEVIN WILL GO WITH YOU.

539
00:26:08,702 --> 00:26:12,439
NO, I'M DONE.

540
00:26:08,702 --> 00:26:12,439
OH, THIS IS FUN.

541
00:26:12,439 --> 00:26:19,045
WHY IS NOBODY LISTENING TO

542
00:26:12,439 --> 00:26:19,045
ME?

543
00:26:19,045 --> 00:26:23,917
OH, I'M NOT READY FOR THIS.

544
00:26:19,045 --> 00:26:23,917
I'M NOT READY!

545
00:26:19,045 --> 00:26:23,917
AHH!

546
00:26:36,930 --> 00:26:41,801
CREW, PRESENT AND ACCOUNTED FOR, SIR.

547

THANK YOU, MR. DOBBS, AT

548
00:26:41,801 --> 00:26:45,972
EASE.

549
00:26:41,801 --> 00:26:45,972
LITTLE FISH, THERE'S TROUBLE OUT

550
00:26:41,801 --> 00:26:45,972
THERE IN THE WATERS, SO THEY

551
00:26:45,972 --> 00:26:52,412
TURNED TO US.

552
00:26:45,972 --> 00:26:52,412
BUT WE'RE NOT GOING OUT THERE

553
00:26:45,972 --> 00:26:52,412
WITH OUR PANTS DOWN, NO, SIR.

554
00:26:52,412 --> 00:27:02,589
UNCLE SAM GAVE US FIRST CLASS

558
00:27:02,589 --> 00:27:09,596
ENTRUSTED TO US FOR ONE PURPOSE.

559
00:27:02,589 --> 00:27:09,596
TO DEFEND OUR COUNTRY, GOD'S

560
00:27:09,596 --> 00:27:14,668
COUNTRY.

561
00:27:09,596 --> 00:27:14,668
NOW THE PRESIDENT MAY CALL THE

562
00:27:09,596 --> 00:27:14,668
SHOTS, BUT THIS HERE IS MY

563
00:27:14,668 --> 00:27:18,338
SUBMARINE.

564
00:27:14,668 --> 00:27:18,338
AND IT'S A PROUD BOAT, ISN'T IT,

565
00:27:14,668 --> 00:27:18,338
MR. DOBBS?

566
00:27:18,338 --> 00:27:24,044
VERY PROUD, SIR.

567
00:27:18,338 --> 00:27:24,044
IT REPRESENTS THE BEST OF US.

568
00:27:18,338 --> 00:27:24,044
THE ABSOLUTE BEST, SIR.

569
00:27:24,044 --> 00:27:30,617
AND THIS SHIP BEARS A NOBLE

570
00:27:24,044 --> 00:27:30,617
NAME, DOESN'T IT, MR. DOBBS?

571
00:27:24,044 --> 00:27:30,617
VERY NOBLE, SIR.

572
00:27:30,617 --> 00:27:38,491
AND WHAT IS THAT NAME,

573
00:27:30,617 --> 00:27:38,491
MR. DOBBS?

574
00:27:30,617 --> 00:27:38,491
MR. DINGLEBERRY'S

SAY IT AGAIN.

578
00:27:46,132 --> 00:27:50,603
MR. DINGLEBERRY'S

6969, SIR.

581
00:27:50,603 --> 00:27:52,839
AND WHY DOES IT HAVE THAT

582
00:27:50,603 --> 00:27:52,839
NAME?

583
00:27:50,603 --> 00:27:52,839
BECAUSE IT WAS DECIDED BY AN

584
00:27:52,839 --> 00:27:58,511
ONLINE POLL, SIR.

585
00:27:52,839 --> 00:27:58,511
AND WHY DID WE LET THAT BE

586
00:27:52,839 --> 00:27:58,511
THE NAME?

587
00:27:58,511 --> 00:28:03,350
BECAUSE WE DIDN'T TAKE THE

588
00:27:58,511 --> 00:28:03,350
POLL SERIOUSLY UNTIL IT WAS TOO

589
00:27:58,511 --> 00:28:03,350
LATE, SIR.

590
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:09,723
AND WHAT PERCENTAGE OF PEOPLE

591
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:09,723
VOTED FOR THIS TO BE THE NAME?

592
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:09,723
AN OVERWHELMING MAJORITY,

593
00:28:09,723 --> 00:28:13,326
SIR.

594
00:28:09,723 --> 00:28:13,326
AND WHY DID WE HAVE A POLL IN

595
00:28:09,723 --> 00:28:13,326
THE FIRST PLACE?

596
00:28:13,326 --> 00:28:19,032
TO GET MORE FOLLOWERS ON

597
00:28:13,326 --> 00:28:19,032
INSTAGRAM, SIR.

598
00:28:13,326 --> 00:28:19,032
AND DID THIS MISSION SUCCEED?

599
00:28:19,032 --> 00:28:26,673
WE GOT MORE VIEWS ON OUR

600
00:28:19,032 --> 00:28:26,673
STORIES, BUT OUR FOLLOWERS GREW

601
00:28:19,032 --> 00:28:26,673
AT PRETTY MUCH THE NORMAL RATE,

602
00:28:26,673 --> 00:28:33,213
SIR.

603
00:28:26,673 --> 00:28:33,213
AND WHO IS MR. DINGLEBERRY?

604
00:28:26,673 --> 00:28:33,213
EVERYONE ASSUMES IT WAS YOU,

605
00:28:33,213 --> 00:28:36,216
SIR.

606
00:28:33,213 --> 00:28:36,216
AND WHAT WAS THE RUNNER UP IN

607
00:28:33,213 --> 00:28:36,216
THE POLL?

608
00:28:36,216 --> 00:28:45,792
DOOKY CRUISER, SIR.

609
00:28:36,216 --> 00:28:45,792
AND WAS THAT ANY BETTER?

610
00:28:36,216 --> 00:28:45,792
IT WAS SHORTER BUT EQUALLY

611
00:28:45,792 --> 00:28:48,194
BAD, SIR.

612
00:28:45,792 --> 00:28:48,194
AND WHAT DOES MR.

613
00:28:45,792 --> 00:28:48,194
DINGLEBERRY'S GOOCHBALLOON

614
00:28:48,194 --> 00:28:53,400
ASDFJKL SEMICOLON 6969 MEAN?

615
00:28:48,194 --> 00:28:53,400
IT'S JUST WHAT YOU GET IF YOU

616
00:28:48,194 --> 00:28:53,400
ROLL YOUR FINGERS ACROSS THE

617
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:57,804
FINGER BOARD, SIR.

618
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:57,804
AND HOW DID WE ASK TO

619
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:57,804
PRONOUNCE IT?

620
00:28:57,804 --> 00:29:05,211
BY SAYING AS-DA-FA-JACKAL.

621
00:28:57,804 --> 00:29:05,211
AND WE DECIDED WHAT?

622
00:28:57,804 --> 00:29:05,211
THAT IT WAS TOO COMPLICATED

623
00:29:05,211 --> 00:29:10,784
AND WE SHOULD JUST SAY THE NAME, SIR.

624
00:29:05,211 --> 00:29:10,784
AND DID WE KNOW WHAT TO DO

625
00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:16,156
WITH THE SEMICOLON?

626
00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:16,156
WE DID NOT, SIR.

627
00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:16,156
SO WHAT DID WE DECIDE TO DO?

628
00:29:16,156 --> 00:29:24,864
TO JUST SAY SEMICOLON, SIR.

629
00:29:16,156 --> 00:29:24,864
AND WHO WAS BEHIND THIS?

630
00:29:16,156 --> 00:29:24,864
>>@GAY KEVIN FROM THE OFFICE.

631
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:33,073
AND WHO WAS@GAY KEVIN FROM

632
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:33,073
THE OFFICE?

633
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:33,073
JUST A RANDOM GUY FROM THE

634
00:29:33,073 --> 00:29:35,875
OFFICE, SIR.

635
00:29:33,073 --> 00:29:35,875
HELLO, MY DARLING, IS IT

636
00:29:33,073 --> 00:29:35,875
URGENT?

637
00:29:35,875 --> 00:29:41,848
IS AND WHY IS IT URGENT?

638
00:29:35,875 --> 00:29:41,848
AND WHY ARE YOU LEAVING ME?

639
00:29:35,875 --> 00:29:41,848
AND ON WHICH DAYS WILL I SEE THE

640
00:29:41,848 --> 00:29:46,319
KIDS?

641
00:29:41,848 --> 00:29:46,319
OKAY, THEN.

642
00:29:41,848 --> 00:29:46,319

00:29:46,319 --> 00:29:51,324
WE ALL DO, SIR.

645
00:29:46,319 --> 00:29:51,324
AND WHY IS THAT?

646
00:29:51,324 --> 00:30:02,202
BECAUSE SHE DIDN'T WANT TO BE

647
00:29:51,324 --> 00:30:02,202
MRS. DINGLEBERRY, SIR.

648
00:29:51,324 --> 00:30:02,202
AND WHO BLEW UP THE SUBMARINE

649
00:30:02,202 --> 00:30:06,139
JUST NOW?

650
00:30:02,202 --> 00:30:06,139
WE ALL DID, SIR.

651
00:30:02,202 --> 00:30:06,139
AND WHY DID WE DO IT?

652
00:30:06,139 --> 00:30:10,610
BECAUSE WE DIDN'T WANT TO DIE

653
00:30:06,139 --> 00:30:10,610
ON SOMETHING CALLED THE GOOCH

654
00:30:06,139 --> 00:30:10,610
BALLOON, SIR.

655
00:30:10,610 --> 00:30:15,615
DAMN RIGHT.

656
00:30:10,610 --> 00:30:15,615
CHIEF OF THE BOAT, DISMISS THE CREW.

657
00:30:15,615 --> 00:30:19,719
CREW.

658
00:30:15,615 --> 00:30:19,719
AYAY.

659
00:30:15,615 --> 00:30:19,719
MR. DINGLEBERRY CREW, FALL OUT

660
00:30:32,232 --> 00:30:36,770
MEANS IT'S TIME TO START

661
00:30:32,232 --> 00:30:36,770
SCREENING FOR CLONE CANCER, AND

662
00:30:36,770 --> 00:30:41,541
THERE'S NO EASIER WAY TO DO IT

663
00:30:36,770 --> 00:30:41,541
THAN WITH COLOGUARD, THE SIMPLE

664
00:30:36,770 --> 00:30:41,541
BOX DELIVERED TO YOUR DOORSTEP.

665
00:30:43,910 --> 00:30:50,216
HI.

666
00:30:43,910 --> 00:30:50,216
I'M COLOGUARD.

667
00:30:43,910 --> 00:30:50,216
OH, YEAH, MY DOCTOR ORDERED

668
00:30:50,216 --> 00:30:52,752
YOU.

669
00:30:50,216 --> 00:30:52,752
THAT'S RIGHT.

670
00:30:50,216 --> 00:30:52,752
BECAUSE I'M SAFE, EASY TO USE.

671
00:30:52,752 --> 00:31:00,160
HOW'S IT WORK?

672
00:30:52,752 --> 00:31:00,160
I JUST NEED TO COLLECT A

673
00:30:52,752 --> 00:31:00,160
SAMPLE, SO OPEN ME UP AND GO

674
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:03,463
INSIDE ME.

675
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:03,463
INSIDE YOU?

676
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:03,463
YEAH, JUST GO INSIDE ME.

677
00:31:03,463 --> 00:31:06,266
IT'S OKAY.

678
00:31:03,463 --> 00:31:06,266
I LIKE IT.

679
00:31:03,463 --> 00:31:06,266
ARE YOU GOING TO LOOK AT ME

680
00:31:06,266 --> 00:31:10,136
LIKE THAT WHILE I DO IT?

681
00:31:06,266 --> 00:31:10,136
SURE.

682
00:31:06,266 --> 00:31:10,136
I'M JUST SMILING BECAUSE I LOVE

683
00:31:10,136 --> 00:31:13,940
MY JOB, AND I LOVE WHAT YOU'RE

684
00:31:10,136 --> 00:31:13,940
ABOUT TO DO TO ME.

685
00:31:10,136 --> 00:31:13,940
WELL, I DON'T LOVE THAT YOU

686
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:18,078
HAVE A FACE AND A LITTLE MOUTH.

687
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:18,078
AND A NAME.

688
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:18,078
I'M THOMAS.

689
00:31:18,078 --> 00:31:23,817
WHY DO I HATE KNOWING THAT?

690
00:31:18,078 --> 00:31:23,817
COME ON, IT'S FUN FOR BOTH OF US.

691
00:31:23,817 --> 00:31:28,321
YOU GET THE SATISFACTION OF

692
00:31:23,817 --> 00:31:28,321
KNOWING YOU'RE DOING EVERYTHING

693
00:31:23,817 --> 00:31:28,321
YOU CAN TO PROTECT YOUR COLON,

694
00:31:28,321 --> 00:31:33,293
AND I GET ANOTHER KIND OF SATISFACTION.

695
00:31:28,321 --> 00:31:33,293
SO GO AHEAD, UNLOAD IN ME.

696
00:31:33,293 --> 00:31:38,465
WHY IS THE U.P.S. GUY

697
00:31:33,293 --> 00:31:38,465
WATCHING?

698
00:31:33,293 --> 00:31:38,465
HE'S WAITING TO COLLECT THE

699
00:31:38,465 --> 00:31:43,236
SAMPLE AFTER YOU'RE DONE.

700
00:31:38,465 --> 00:31:43,236
GO AHEAD, UNLEASH.

701
00:31:38,465 --> 00:31:43,236
I DON'T FEEL COMFORTABLE

702
00:31:43,236 --> 00:31:47,674
DOING THIS IN FRONT OF YOU GUYS.

703
00:31:43,236 --> 00:31:47,674
WOULD YOU FEEL MORE

704
00:31:43,236 --> 00:31:47,674
COMFORTABLE UNLOADING ON A

705
00:31:47,674 --> 00:31:51,444
LITTLE WOMAN LIKE ME?

706
00:31:47,674 --> 00:31:51,444
WOULD THAT MAKE YOU FEEL LIKE A

707
00:31:47,674 --> 00:31:51,444
REAL MAN?

708
00:31:51,444 --> 00:31:55,749
GOD, NO.

709
00:31:51,444 --> 00:31:55,749
I JUST WANT TO BE SCREENED FOR

710
00:31:51,444 --> 00:31:55,749
COLON CANCER.

711
00:31:55,749 --> 00:32:03,623
THEN GO AHEAD, DESTROY ME,

712
00:31:55,749 --> 00:32:03,623
DADDY, BLOW MY BOX OPEN.

713
00:31:55,749 --> 00:32:03,623
YEAH, I WANT TO SEE YOU BLOW

714
00:32:03,623 --> 00:32:07,827
THAT BOX WIDE OPEN.

715
00:32:03,623 --> 00:32:07,827
THIS IS SICK.

716
00:32:03,623 --> 00:32:07,827
BUT NOT SICK FROM COLON

717
00:32:07,827 --> 00:32:11,965
CANCER.

718
00:32:07,827 --> 00:32:11,965
SO JUST GO INSIDE HER, THEN PASS

719
00:32:07,827 --> 00:32:11,965
THE SUPER WARM BOX TO THE U.P.S.

720
00:32:11,965 --> 00:32:15,201
GUY.

721
00:32:11,965 --> 00:32:15,201
GET IT NICE AND WARM BEFORE

722
00:32:11,965 --> 00:32:15,201
YOU HAND IT BACK TO ME.

723
00:32:15,201 --> 00:32:19,539
I'LL EVEN CLOSE MY EYES WHILE

724
00:32:15,201 --> 00:32:19,539
YOU DO IT.

725
00:32:15,201 --> 00:32:19,539
I SEE YOU PEEKING.

726
00:32:19,539 --> 00:32:23,209
HOW MANY OF YOU ARE THERE?

727
00:32:19,539 --> 00:32:23,209
IT'S OKAY.

728
00:32:19,539 --> 00:32:23,209
WE'RE JUST HERE TO WATCH.

729
00:32:23,209 --> 00:32:29,082
WE'RE FRIENDLY LIKE MINIONS,

730
00:32:23,209 --> 00:32:29,082
SO GO AHEAD AND UNLEASH.

731
00:32:23,209 --> 00:32:29,082
STOP SAYING UNLEASH.

732
00:32:29,082 --> 00:32:37,691
WOULD IT HELP IF YOU KNEW

733
00:32:29,082 --> 00:32:37,691
THEIR NAMES?

734
00:32:29,082 --> 00:32:37,691
THAT'S KYLIE, VICTOR, NEIL, AND

735
00:32:37,691 --> 00:32:40,360
SHEVAT.

736
00:32:37,691 --> 00:32:40,360
WE CAN'T WAIT TO SEE YOU UNLEASH.

737
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:48,234
I'M ACTUALLY GOOD.

738
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:48,234
I JUST REMEMBERED THAT I

739
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:48,234
SCREENED FOR COLON CANCER LAST

740
00:32:48,234 --> 00:32:50,904
YEAR, SO.

741
00:32:48,234 --> 00:32:50,904
AND YOU WOULDN'T BE LYING TO

742
00:32:48,234 --> 00:32:50,904
US, RIGHT?

743
00:32:50,904 --> 00:32:53,973
OF COURSE NOT.

744
00:32:50,904 --> 00:32:53,973
BECAUSE WE CAN ALSO DETECT LIARS.

745
00:32:53,973 --> 00:32:58,678
NOW DROP YOUR PANTS, BLOW OUT

746
00:32:53,973 --> 00:32:58,678
HIS BOX, AND THIS WILL ALL BE OVER.

747
00:32:58,678 --> 00:33:03,183
JUST DO WHAT THE LITTLE BOXES

748
00:32:58,678 --> 00:33:03,183
SAY TO DO.

749
00:32:58,678 --> 00:33:03,183
I'LL GIVE YOU WHAT YOU WANT,

750
00:33:03,183 --> 00:33:14,361
JUST PLEASE DON'T KILL ME.

751
00:33:03,183 --> 00:33:14,361
MAN, IS WOODY OKAY?

752
00:33:03,183 --> 00:33:14,361
I KNOW HE SMOKES A TON OF

753
00:33:14,361 --> 00:33:18,598
WEED, BUT I'M REALLY STARTING TO

754
00:33:14,361 --> 00:33:18,598
WORRY ABOUT HIM. OH.

755
00:33:18,598 --> 00:33:22,068
ALL RIGHT.

756
00:33:18,598 --> 00:33:22,068
LET'S HEAD INSIDE AND GIVE HIM

757
00:33:18,598 --> 00:33:22,068
SOME PRIVACY.

758
00:33:22,068 --> 00:33:29,309
ACTUALLY, I'M GOING TO STAY.

759
00:33:22,068 --> 00:33:29,309
I'M GOING TO WATCH HIM UNLEASH.

760
00:33:22,068 --> 00:33:29,309
COLOGUARD, GO AHEAD, WE LIKE

00:33:29,309 --> 00:33:30,777
I'M GOING TO WATCH HIM UNLEASH.

762

COLOGUARD, GO AHEAD, WE LIKE IT.

763
00:33:41,488 --> 00:33:48,094
HE'S BEEN HERE FIVE TIMES TOO.

764
00:33:41,488 --> 00:33:48,094
DOES HE GET A JACKET?

765

WELCOME TO "WEEKEND UPDATE."
I'M MICHAEL CHE?

00:38:50,632 --> 00:38:53,112
I'M COLIN JOST.

832
00:38:53,815 --> 00:38:59,503
THIS WEEK, PRESIDENT BIDEN MADE
A HISTORIC VISIT TO UKRAINE AND
MED WITH UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT VLADIMIR ZELENSKYY

833
00:38:59,503 --> 00:39:03,785
WHERE THEY
GREETED EACH OTHER LIKE TWO
ACTION FIGURES HAVING SEX.

834
00:39:04,351 --> 00:39:07,376
ANN

835
00:39:07,469 --> 00:39:11,187
BOTH

836
00:39:11,187 --> 00:39:12,601
BARRIER

837
00:39:12,601 --> 00:39:17,075
BIDEN

838
00:39:17,369 --> 00:39:21,379
REPUBLICANS CRITICIZED
BIDEN UKRAINE

839
00:39:21,379 --> 00:39:24,865
INSTEAD TO THE OHIO TOXIC
TRAIN DERAILMENT,

840
00:39:24,865 --> 00:39:29,783
BUT BIDEN SAID
HE WAS WAITING TO SHOOT THE
TRAIN DOWN UNTIL IT WAS OVER THE
OCEAN.

841
00:39:30,448 --> 00:39:34,088
>>> PRESIDENT BIDEN IS BEING
PRAISED FOR HIS SURPRISE VISIT
TO UKRAINE

842
00:39:34,189 --> 00:39:36,898
BY TAKING A TEN-HOUR
TRAIN RIDE FROM POLAND.

843
00:39:36,898 --> 00:39:40,423
YOU KNOW WHO ELSE
TAKES A TRAIN RIDE THROUGH AN
ACTIVE WAR ZONE?

844
00:39:40,423 --> 00:39:42,713
EVERY NEW YORKER.

845
00:39:43,659 --> 00:39:46,905
CHINA

846
00:39:46,985 --> 00:39:49,718
IMPOSED A 12-PART PLAN FOR
PEACE.

847
00:39:49,778 --> 00:39:53,853
THE PLAN IS THE 12 PARTS HAVE TO
BE ASSEMBLED BY CHILDREN.

848
00:39:56,392 --> 00:40:00,478
DONALD TRUMP VISITED EAST
PALESTINE, THE SITE OF THE RECENT TRAIN DERAILMENT

849
00:40:00,478 --> 00:40:05,818
BECAUSE
TRUMP YOU USUALLY TRIES TO MAKE
HIMSELF LOOK BETTER BY STANDING
NEXT TO A TRAIN WRECK.

850
00:40:07,505 --> 00:40:12,529
THE TRAIN THAT DERAILED WAS
CARRYING HIGHLY TOXIC VINYL CHLORIDE

851
00:40:12,529 --> 00:40:16,629
WHICH I THINK IS
SOMETHING TRUMP RECOMMENDED AS A
CURE FOR COVID.

852
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:22,889
WHILE VISITING THE DISASTER
SITE, TRUMP ALSO GAVE OUT
BOTTLES OF TRUMP BRAND WATER.

853
00:40:22,889 --> 00:40:27,505
SAID RESIDENTS, THANKS, BUT WE
WOULD RATHER DRINK THE TOXIC
TRAIN WATER.

854
00:40:28,143 --> 00:40:33,781
PETE BUD JEENL VISITED THE SITE,

855
00:40:33,781 --> 00:40:36,128
AND WAS CRITICIZED FOR
WEARING LEATHER BOOTS.

856
00:40:36,128 --> 00:40:39,815
GIVE HIM A BREAK.
THAT'S ALL THEY HAD AT BABY GAP.

857
00:40:41,892 --> 00:40:46,322
TUCKER CARLSON SEEN HERE AT A
WHITES ONLY RAVE

858
00:40:47,977 --> 00:40:52,028
HAS BEEN
GRANTED ACCESS TO OVER 40,000 HOURS

859
00:40:52,028 --> 00:40:55,366
OF SECURITY FOOTAGE FROM
THE JANUARY 6th RIOTS.

860
00:40:55,366 --> 00:40:58,811
WATCHING ALL THAT WOULD MAKE YOU GO INSANE,

861
00:40:58,811 --> 00:41:02,481
SAID DOCTORS ABOUT
TUCKER CARLSON'S SHOW.

862
00:41:02,963 --> 00:41:07,412
GEORGIA REPRESENTATIVE AND
COCAINE BEAR MARJORIE TAYLOR GREEN

863
00:41:07,412 --> 00:41:10,996
TWEETED THE COUNTRY NEEDS
A DIVORCE.

864
00:41:10,996 --> 00:41:15,793
WHICH MAKES SENSE.

865
00:41:15,793 --> 00:41:19,202
FLORIDA GOVERNOR RON DeSANTIS IS
RELEASED A NEW MEMOIR

866
00:41:19,202 --> 00:41:21,216
CALLED THE COURAGE TO BE FREE,

867
00:41:21,216 --> 00:41:26,827
EVEN THOUGH
THAT SOUNDS LIKE A BLACK HISTORY
BOOK HE'S BANNED.

868
00:41:26,827 --> 00:41:30,799
IT WAS ANNOUNCED THE
PRODUCERS OF THIS YEAR'S ACADEMY
AWARDS HAVE PUT UP A CRISIS TEAM

869
00:41:30,856 --> 00:41:34,549
TO DEAL WITH INCIDENTS SIMILAR
TO LAST YEAR'S WILL SMITH SLAP.

870
00:41:34,596 --> 00:41:38,394
IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN AGAIN.

871
00:41:38,394 --> 00:41:41,291
IF ANYTHING, IT HELPS RATINGS.

872
00:41:41,291 --> 00:41:46,015
THE PROMO SHOULD BE, WHO'S GOING
TO GET SLAPPED THIS YEAR?

873
00:41:46,127 --> 00:41:50,405
ARMAS TAR

874
00:41:50,405 --> 00:41:55,009
WHICH BANSHEE WILL KNOCK THE
SHOES OFF?

875
00:41:55,009 --> 00:41:59,777
AND WHO HAS WHAT IT TAKES TO
WHALE ON BRENDAN FRASER.

876
00:42:03,371 --> 00:42:12,399
JAMES ARE STRUGGLING.

877
00:42:02,222 --> 00:42:12,399
HERE IS NBA ANALYST AND HALL OF

878
00:42:02,222 --> 00:42:12,399
FAMER BILL WALTON.

879
00:42:12,399 --> 00:42:21,107
AMAZING TO BE HERE, SATURDAY

880
00:42:12,399 --> 00:42:21,107
NIGHT LIFE, THE PREMIER COMEDY

881
00:42:12,399 --> 00:42:21,107
SHOW IN THE HISTORY OF

882
00:42:21,107 --> 00:42:25,645
CIVILIZATION.

883
00:42:21,107 --> 00:42:25,645
MICHAEL CHE, LORD OF THE LOWER

884
00:42:21,107 --> 00:42:25,645
EAST SIDE, THROW IT DOWN, BIG

885
00:42:25,645 --> 00:42:30,350
FELLA.

886
00:42:25,645 --> 00:42:30,350
SURE, MAN.

887
00:42:25,645 --> 00:42:30,350
SO YOU'RE AN NBA ANALYST.

888
00:42:30,350 --> 00:42:36,089
YOU ALSO HAVE YOUR OWN SHOW ON

889
00:42:30,350 --> 00:42:36,089
NBA TV.

890
00:42:30,350 --> 00:42:36,089
AND YOU'RE ALSO A LITTLE WEIRD.

891
00:42:36,089 --> 00:42:42,395
MICHAEL, I'M AN ATHLETE, I'M

892
00:42:36,089 --> 00:42:42,395
AN ANALYST.

893
00:42:36,089 --> 00:42:42,395
I AM A SPIRITUAL NOMAD.

894
00:42:42,395 --> 00:42:50,203
I AM A CURIOUS NYMPH IN GOD'S

895
00:42:42,395 --> 00:42:50,203
ASTONISHING GARDEN, AND I WAS

896
00:42:42,395 --> 00:42:50,203
JUST BACKSTAGE IN WOODY

897
00:42:50,203 --> 00:42:54,841
HARRELSON'S DRESSING ROOM.

898
00:42:50,203 --> 00:42:54,841
THE SECOND HALF OF THE SHOW IS

899
00:42:50,203 --> 00:42:54,841
GOING TO BE BANANAS.

900
00:42:54,841 --> 00:43:00,447
SO TODAY THE LAKERS ARE 13th

901
00:42:54,841 --> 00:43:00,447
IN THE WESTERN CONFERENCE.

902
00:42:54,841 --> 00:43:00,447
DO YOU THINK THEY'LL MAKE THE

903
00:43:00,447 --> 00:43:08,421
PLAYOFFS?

904
00:43:00,447 --> 00:43:08,421
THE LAKERS HAVE A HISTORY

905
00:43:00,447 --> 00:43:08,421
THAT WOULD MAKE AVADAGO'S

906
00:43:08,421 --> 00:43:16,563
BEAKERS BOIL WITH CHEMISTRY.

907
00:43:08,421 --> 00:43:16,563
LeBRON, ANTHONY DAVIS, AND THE

908
00:43:08,421 --> 00:43:16,563
NEWBY DEANGLO RUSSELL, THEIR ON

909
00:43:16,563 --> 00:43:22,669
THE COURT ARTISTRY MOVES ME TO TEARS.

910
00:43:16,563 --> 00:43:22,669
ANTHONY DAVIS FOR THREE, GREAT

911
00:43:22,669 --> 00:43:25,672
SHOT.

912
00:43:22,669 --> 00:43:25,672
ARE YOU CALLING A GAME RIGHT

913
00:43:22,669 --> 00:43:25,672
NOW?

914
00:43:25,672 --> 00:43:32,712
MY SPIRIT GUIDE SENDS ME

915
00:43:25,672 --> 00:43:32,712
FLASHES OF WHAT IS, WHAT WAS,

916
00:43:25,672 --> 00:43:32,712
AND WHAT SHALL BE.

917
00:43:32,712 --> 00:43:40,687
SO I'M CALLING A GAME THAT TAKES

918
00:43:32,712 --> 00:43:40,687
PLACE NEXT WEDNESDAY.

919
00:43:32,712 --> 00:43:40,687
OH, D.LO WITH THE LAYUP, AND THE

920
00:43:40,687 --> 00:43:44,391
LEAD IS CUT TO SIX.

921
00:43:40,687 --> 00:43:44,391
SO YOU MUST KNOW THE FUTURE.

922
00:43:40,687 --> 00:43:44,391
I'LL ASK AGAIN.

923
00:43:44,391 --> 00:43:51,264
ARE THE LAKERS GOING TO MAKE THE

924
00:43:44,391 --> 00:43:51,264
PLAYOFFS?

925
00:43:44,391 --> 00:43:51,264
A LONG TIME AGO IN A GALAXY

926
00:43:51,264 --> 00:43:57,137
FAR, FAR AWAY, GOD HERSELF

927
00:43:51,264 --> 00:43:57,137
BIRTHED THE TECH TONIC MARVEL WE

928
00:43:51,264 --> 00:43:57,137
CALL LOS ANGELES, CHE.

929
00:43:57,137 --> 00:44:03,710
OUT OF BOUNDS.

930
00:43:57,137 --> 00:44:03,710
LAKERS BALL, THE REFS ARE GOING

931
00:43:57,137 --> 00:44:03,710
TO TAKE A LOOK AT THIS ONE.

932
00:44:03,710 --> 00:44:10,417
YES!

933
00:44:03,710 --> 00:44:10,417
WHAT WE NOW CALL PARADISE

934
00:44:03,710 --> 00:44:10,417
STARTED AS A MEGABONE YARD, BUT

935
00:44:10,417 --> 00:44:17,424
ITS SPIRIT HAS CARRIED ON JUST

936
00:44:10,417 --> 00:44:17,424
LIKE THE GRATEFUL DEAD CARRIED

937
00:44:10,417 --> 00:44:17,424
ON WHEN THEY BROUGHT IN THE

938
00:44:17,424 --> 00:44:23,530
NOODLER OF NATIONS, JOHN MAYIER,

939
00:44:17,424 --> 00:44:23,530
A POET WHOSE ONLY COLLEAGUES ARE

940
00:44:17,424 --> 00:44:23,530
THE PLANETS THEMSELVES.

941
00:44:23,530 --> 00:44:29,069
BIG DUNK FROM LeBRON, THROW IT

942
00:44:23,530 --> 00:44:29,069
DOWN!

943
00:44:23,530 --> 00:44:29,069
GOD, I WISH YOU COULD SEE THIS,

944
00:44:29,069 --> 00:44:32,405
MICHAEL.

945
00:44:29,069 --> 00:44:32,405
WELL, I CAN'T.

946
00:44:29,069 --> 00:44:32,405
SO TELL ME ARE THE LAKERS GOING

947
00:44:32,405 --> 00:44:37,677
TO MAKE THE PLAYOFFS?

948
00:44:32,405 --> 00:44:37,677
YES OR NO?

949
00:44:32,405 --> 00:44:37,677
YES THE LAKERS CAN MAKE THE

950
00:44:37,677 --> 00:44:42,949
PLAYOFFS IF THEY CAN ANSWER ONE

951
00:44:37,677 --> 00:44:42,949
SIMPLE QUESTION.

952
00:44:37,677 --> 00:44:42,949
IS THERE AN AFTERLIFE, AND WHAT

953
00:44:42,949 --> 00:44:48,621
SCIENTIFIC BASIS IS THERE FOR

954
00:44:42,949 --> 00:44:48,621
THE PERSISTENCE OF THE SOUL

955
00:44:42,949 --> 00:44:48,621
AFTER DEATH?

956
00:44:48,621 --> 00:44:57,163

SOME OF HIS INSENSITIVE LANGUAGE

969
00:45:18,585 --> 00:45:25,792
LIKE THE WORDS FAT AND UGLY AS

970
00:45:18,585 --> 00:45:25,792
WELL AS MODERNIZING HIS

971
00:45:25,792 --> 00:45:31,464
PORTRAYAL OF WOMAN.

972
00:45:25,792 --> 00:45:31,464
WHICH WILL MOST LIKELY AFFECT

973
00:45:25,792 --> 00:45:31,464
THE BOOK, THE FAT UGLY WIFE WHO

974
00:45:31,464 --> 00:45:36,202
KNEW HER PLACE.

975
00:45:31,464 --> 00:45:36,202
IT WAS ANNOUNCED THAT

976
00:45:31,464 --> 00:45:36,202
BRITTNEY GRINER HAS SIGNED WITH

977
00:45:36,202 --> 00:45:40,707
THE PHOENIX MERCURY FOR ONE YEAR.

978
00:45:36,202 --> 00:45:40,707
UNFORTUNATELY, THE WNBA PAYSLESS

979
00:45:40,707 --> 00:45:49,115
THAN A RUSSIAN PRISON.

980
00:45:40,707 --> 00:45:49,115
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO LIKE THIS

981
00:45:40,707 --> 00:45:49,115
NEXT ONE.

982
00:45:49,115 --> 00:45:52,819
A FOUR-FOOT LONG ALLIGATOR WAS

983
00:45:49,115 --> 00:45:52,819
DISCOVERED IN BROOKLYN'S

984
00:45:49,115 --> 00:45:52,819

986
00:45:52,819 --> 00:45:57,791
ALL THOSE MISSING DOG POSTERS.

987
00:45:52,819 --> 00:45:57,791
THANK YOU, THANK YOU.

MICHAEL CHE'S NEW SEGMENT.

995
00:46:08,134 --> 00:46:15,608
WHAT DO THEY EVEN DO WRONG?

996
00:46:08,134 --> 00:46:15,608
I MEAN, MAINLY THEY'RE GUILTY

997
00:46:15,608 --> 00:46:22,148
OF LOVING TOO MUCH, RIGHT?

998
00:46:15,608 --> 00:46:22,148
A PLAYER'S GOT TO PLAY.

999
00:46:15,608 --> 00:46:22,148
AM I RIGHT, LADIES?

1000
00:46:22,148 --> 00:46:28,088
NO.

1001
00:46:22,148 --> 00:46:28,088
THIS HAS BEEN, WHAT DID THEY

1002
00:46:22,148 --> 00:46:28,088
EVEN DO WRONG.

1003
00:46:28,088 --> 00:46:32,559

1044
00:48:09,556 --> 00:48:14,928

WAS HUNGOVER.

1063
00:48:41,955 --> 00:48:46,826
HE'S ALWAYS HUNGOVER.

1064
00:48:41,955 --> 00:48:46,826
HE'S IN MY FRIDGE, HE'S PULLING

1065
00:48:46,826 --> 00:48:52,932

1071
00:48:56,603 --> 00:49:02,509
YOU CAN'T TAKE MA'S FOOD.

1072
00:48:56,603 --> 00:49:02,509
I SAY, WHO CARES?

1073
00:48:56,603 --> 00:49:02,509
GIRLS, SHUT UP.

1074

ANTHONY'S 38 YEARS OLD.

1075
00:49:02,509 --> 00:49:07,080
HE'S A GROWING BOY.

1076

SO WHAT WOULD YOU TELL SOMEONE

1080
00:49:11,551 --> 00:49:15,221

00:49:11,551 --> 00:49:15,221
KIDS?

1082
00:49:11,551 --> 00:49:15,221

00:49:20,860 --> 00:49:28,435
WALLET.

1087

00:49:28,435 --> 00:49:33,940
HE WRITES HIMSELF A CHECK FOR 14

1090
00:49:28,435 --> 00:49:33,940
GRAND FROM MY CHECKBOOK.

00:49:33,940 --> 00:49:38,945
PUTTING UP WITH MA.

1093
00:49:33,940 --> 00:49:38,945
I'M DYING OVER HERE.

1094
00:49:33,940 --> 00:49:38,945
MY DAUGHTERS SAY, THAT'S MA'S

1095
00:49:38,945 --> 00:49:43,650
MONEY.

1096
00:49:38,945 --> 00:49:43,650
YOU CAN'T TAKE MA'S MONEY.

1097
00:49:38,945 --> 00:49:43,650
I'M LIKE, GIRLS, PLEASE, YOU'RE

1098
00:49:43,650 --> 00:49:49,155
NOT PRETTY ENOUGH TO BE THIS IRRITATING.

1099
00:49:43,650 --> 00:49:49,155
BUT MY SON, OH, MY GOD, I LOVE

1100
00:49:49,155 --> 00:49:51,558
MY SON. YEAH. NO.

1101
00:49:51,558 --> 00:49:56,062
WE'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT YOUR SON.

1102
00:49:51,558 --> 00:49:56,062
WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME ABOUT YOUR

1103
00:49:56,062 --> 00:50:01,735
DAUGHTER.

1104
00:49:56,062 --> 00:50:01,735
THEY'RE DOCTORS.

1105
00:49:56,062 --> 00:50:01,735
BUT MY SON DID THIS HILARIOUS

1106
00:50:01,735 --> 00:50:05,005
PRANK LAST NIGHT WHERE HE

1107
00:50:01,735 --> 00:50:05,005
PRETENDED TO ROB ME AT GUN POINT.

1108
00:50:05,005 --> 00:50:07,874
THAT'S TERRIBLE.

1109
00:50:05,005 --> 00:50:07,874
MY DAUGHTERS SAY, YOU CAN'T

1110
00:50:05,005 --> 00:50:07,874
DO THAT.

1111
00:50:07,874 --> 00:50:13,079
MY DAUGHTERS, THEY BOUGHT ME A HOUSE.

1112
00:50:07,874 --> 00:50:13,079
BUT MY SON, I MEAN, I WOULD IF I

1113
00:50:13,079 --> 00:50:16,216
COULD.

1114
00:50:13,079 --> 00:50:16,216
OKAY.

1115
00:50:13,079 --> 00:50:16,216
ALL RIGHT.

1116
00:50:16,216 --> 00:50:18,151
WELL--

1117
00:50:16,216 --> 00:50:18,151
I WOULD.

1118
00:50:16,216 --> 00:50:18,151
I--

1119
00:50:18,151 --> 00:50:23,123
GETTING BACK TO THE TOPIC OF PARENTHOOD.

1120
00:50:18,151 --> 00:50:23,123
DO YOU THINK YOUR KIDS ARE GOING

1121
00:50:23,123 --> 00:50:26,993
TO HAVE KIDS SOME DAY.

1122
00:50:23,123 --> 00:50:26,993
OH, PLEASE.

1123
00:50:23,123 --> 00:50:26,993
THERE'S NOT A WOMAN OUT THERE

1124
00:50:26,993 --> 00:50:30,697
GOOD ENOUGH FOR MY SON.

1125
00:50:26,993 --> 00:50:30,697
SO ANTHONY'S SINGLE?

1126
00:50:26,993 --> 00:50:30,697
NO.

1127
00:50:30,697 --> 00:50:37,270
HE'S BEEN MARRIED FOR TWO YEARS.

1128
00:50:30,697 --> 00:50:37,270
AND I JUST HAVE THIS FEELING,

1129
00:50:30,697 --> 00:50:37,270
OKAY, THAT SHE IS GIVING HIM

1130
00:50:37,270 --> 00:50:42,642
NOTHING IN BED.

1131
00:50:37,270 --> 00:50:42,642
LIKE SHE COMPLETELY IGNORES HIS BALLS.

1132
00:50:42,642 --> 00:50:44,978
OKAY.

1133
00:50:42,642 --> 00:50:44,978
WHAT?

1134
00:50:42,642 --> 00:50:44,978
WHY ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT

1135
00:50:44,978 --> 00:50:49,082
THAT?

1136
00:50:44,978 --> 00:50:49,082
OKAY.

1137
00:50:44,978 --> 00:50:49,082
AND I BET SHE'S OBSESSED WITH

1138
00:50:49,082 --> 00:50:54,854
HAVING AN ORGASM.

1139
00:50:49,082 --> 00:50:54,854
LIKE, NO, HONEY.

1140
00:50:49,082 --> 00:50:54,854
THAT'S NOT HOW IT WORKS.

1141
00:50:54,854 --> 00:51:03,763
WHEN HE'S DONE, YOU'RE DONE.

1142
00:50:54,854 --> 00:51:03,763
GINA BIANCHI, EVERYONE.

1143
00:50:54,854 --> 00:51:03,763
I LOVE ALL MY KIDS EQUALLY.

1144
00:51:03,763 --> 00:51:06,366
FOR "WEEKEND UPDATE," I'M

1145
00:51:03,763 --> 00:51:06,366
COLIN JOST.

1146
00:51:03,763 --> 00:51:06,366
I'M MICHAEL CHE.

1147
00:51:06,366 --> 00:51:08,201
COLIN JOST.

1148
00:51:06,366 --> 00:51:08,201
I'M MICHAEL CHE.

1149
00:51:06,366 --> 00:51:08,201
GOOD NIGHT.

1150
00:51:33,093 --> 00:51:38,231
THE STUDIO.

1151
00:51:33,093 --> 00:51:38,231
OH, NO.

1152
00:51:33,093 --> 00:51:38,231
GOD, WAS IT ABOUT THAT POTENTIAL

1153
00:51:38,231 --> 00:51:41,568
WRITER'S STRIKE. NO. WORSE.

1154
00:51:41,568 --> 00:51:49,476
THE GENIUSES AT THE STUDIO ARE

1155
00:51:41,568 --> 00:51:49,476
NO LONGER INTERESTED IN A

1156
00:51:41,568 --> 00:51:49,476
GUT-WRENCHING DRAMA ABOUT

1157
00:51:49,476 --> 00:51:58,518
OBESITY, SO THEY'RE SHUTTING THE

1158
00:51:49,476 --> 00:51:58,518
FILM DOWN.

1159
00:51:49,476 --> 00:51:58,518
THAT'S A WRAP ON THE HIPPO.

1160
00:51:58,518 --> 00:52:05,658
I KNOW HOW MUCH WORK YOU ALL DID

1161
00:51:58,518 --> 00:52:05,658
TO WORK ON YOUR ROLES.

1162
00:51:58,518 --> 00:52:05,658
I SHADOWED A THERAPIST FOR

1163
00:52:05,658 --> 00:52:11,264
TWO WEEKS TO GET INTO CHARACTER, BLAKE.

1164
00:52:05,658 --> 00:52:11,264
AND JONAS GREW A BEARD, WHICH

1165
00:52:11,264 --> 00:52:18,571
I KNEW HE HATES.

1166
00:52:11,264 --> 00:52:18,571
I DO HATE IT.

1167
00:52:11,264 --> 00:52:18,571
AND FOR HIS ROLE, KEITH

1168
00:52:18,571 --> 00:52:25,578
GAINED 450 POUNDS IN SIX MONTHS.

1169
00:52:18,571 --> 00:52:25,578
TO BE CLEAR, THE MOVIE IS

1170
00:52:18,571 --> 00:52:25,578
OFFICIALLY DEAD AS IN WE'RE NOT

1171
00:52:25,578 --> 00:52:30,150
MAKING IT?

1172
00:52:25,578 --> 00:52:30,150
NO.

1173
00:52:25,578 --> 00:52:30,150
THE HIPPO WILL NEVER SEE THE

1174
00:52:30,150 --> 00:52:32,986
LIGHT OF DAY.

1175
00:52:30,150 --> 00:52:32,986
HUH, THAT IS-- THAT'S ROUGH

1176
00:52:30,150 --> 00:52:32,986
TO HEAR.

1177
00:52:32,986 --> 00:52:38,558
WAIT.

1178
00:52:32,986 --> 00:52:38,558
SO IF WE'RE NOT MAKING THE

1179
00:52:32,986 --> 00:52:38,558
MOVIE, THAT MEANS I DYED MY HAIR

1180
00:52:38,558 --> 00:52:43,096
BROWN FOR NOTHING?

1181
00:52:38,558 --> 00:52:43,096
HEY, HEY, IT'S FINE.

1182
00:52:38,558 --> 00:52:43,096
WE'RE ALL UPSET.

1183
00:52:43,096 --> 00:52:47,300
KEITH, YOU LOOK LIKE THIS IS

1184
00:52:43,096 --> 00:52:47,300
HITTING YOU PRETTY HOARD TOO, BUDDY.

1185
00:52:47,300 --> 00:52:54,107
YEAH.

1186
00:52:47,300 --> 00:52:54,107
I GOT TO SAY, THIS IS REALLY

1187
00:52:47,300 --> 00:52:54,107
UNFORTUNATE FOR ME PERSONALLY.

1188
00:52:54,107 --> 00:53:04,818
YEAH, FOR ALL OF US.

1189
00:52:54,107 --> 00:53:04,818
WE ALL SACRIFICED FOR THIS FILM.

1190
00:52:54,107 --> 00:53:04,818
I SHADOWED THAT THERAPIST ON MY

1191
00:53:04,818 --> 00:53:07,187
OWN TIME.

1192
00:53:04,818 --> 00:53:07,187
I CAN'T GET THOSE TWO WEEKS BACK.

1193
00:53:07,187 --> 00:53:13,093
AND I GAINED 450 POUNDS IN

1194
00:53:07,187 --> 00:53:13,093
SIX MONTHS.

1195
00:53:07,187 --> 00:53:13,093
THAT'S A LIFESTYLE CHANGE.

1196
00:53:13,093 --> 00:53:18,898
I HAVE SOMETHING CALLED

1197
00:53:13,093 --> 00:53:18,898
TRIABETES NOW.

1198
00:53:13,093 --> 00:53:18,898
IT'S THE ONE AFTER DIABETES.

1199
00:53:18,898 --> 00:53:23,169
AND I HAVE THIS GOD DAMN BEARD. SORRY.

1200
00:53:23,169 --> 00:53:29,442
IT'S ITCHY, AND GROWING IT WAS A

1201
00:53:23,169 --> 00:53:29,442
HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE.

1202
00:53:23,169 --> 00:53:29,442
I CAN RELATE BECAUSE GAINING

1203
00:53:29,442 --> 00:53:35,949
450 POUNDS IN SIX MONTHS ALSO

1204
00:53:29,442 --> 00:53:35,949
WAS NOT FUN.

1205
00:53:29,442 --> 00:53:35,949
I HAD TO EAT SOMETHING CALLED

1206
00:53:35,949 --> 00:53:41,421
GRISTLE LOAF.

1207
00:53:35,949 --> 00:53:41,421
DOES ANYONE KNOW ABOUT THIS?

1208
00:53:35,949 --> 00:53:41,421
IT'S A COMPRESSED BEEF FAT AND

1209
00:53:41,421 --> 00:53:46,459
CORN SIR UP.

1210
00:53:41,421 --> 00:53:46,459
I KNOW EXACTLY HOW YOU FEEL, KEITH.

1211
00:53:46,459 --> 00:53:51,865
MY HAIR IS SO BRITTLE FROM THE

1212
00:53:46,459 --> 00:53:51,865
BROWN DYE.

1213
00:53:46,459 --> 00:53:51,865
WELL, THIS IS GRISTLE LOAF BY

1214
00:53:51,865 --> 00:53:56,336
THE WAY.

1215
00:53:51,865 --> 00:53:56,336
IT'S WHAT THEY FEED SICK

1216
00:53:51,865 --> 00:53:56,336
ELEPHANTS AT THE ZOO TO GET THEM

1217
00:53:56,336 --> 00:54:02,876
BACK TO THEIR NORMAL WEIGHT.

1218
00:53:56,336 --> 00:54:02,876
ATE NINE OF THESE A DAY BECAUSE

1219
00:53:56,336 --> 00:54:02,876
I THOUGHT I WOULD WIN THE OSCAR.

1220
00:54:02,876 --> 00:54:06,312
AND YOU WOULD HAVE.

1221
00:54:02,876 --> 00:54:06,312
DAMN IT.

1222
00:54:02,876 --> 00:54:06,312
I SHOULD HAVE SEEN THIS COMING.

1223
00:54:06,312 --> 00:54:12,752
THE STUDIO WAS FIGHTING ME FROM

1224
00:54:06,312 --> 00:54:12,752
DAY ONE.

1225
00:54:06,312 --> 00:54:12,752
SHAINA, DID YOU KNOW THEY WANTED

1226
00:54:12,752 --> 00:54:18,158
YOUR PART TO BE PLAYED BY A

1227
00:54:12,752 --> 00:54:18,158
WHITE WOMAN?

1228
00:54:12,752 --> 00:54:18,158
THE SAD THING IS I'M NOT

1229
00:54:18,158 --> 00:54:22,529
SURPRISED.

1230
00:54:18,158 --> 00:54:22,529
AND JONAS, THEY WANTED TO CUT

1231
00:54:18,158 --> 00:54:22,529
YOU OUT OF ACT THREE.

1232
00:54:22,529 --> 00:54:28,068
AND THEN THERE WOULD BE NO

1233
00:54:22,529 --> 00:54:28,068
RESOLUTION TO THE CUSTODY STORY

1234
00:54:22,529 --> 00:54:28,068
LINE?

1235
00:54:28,068 --> 00:54:31,738
THEY ARE SO AFRAID OF ORIGINAL IDEAS.

1236
00:54:28,068 --> 00:54:31,738
AND GET THIS, INSTEAD OF

1237
00:54:31,738 --> 00:54:39,079
GAINING 450 POUNDS IN SIX

1238
00:54:31,738 --> 00:54:39,079
MONTHS, THEY WANTED KEITH TO

1239
00:54:31,738 --> 00:54:39,079
WEAR A FAT SUIT.

1240
00:54:39,079 --> 00:54:43,183
IS THAT-- WAS THAT AN

1241
00:54:39,079 --> 00:54:43,183
OPTION?

1242
00:54:39,079 --> 00:54:43,183
YEAH.

1243
00:54:43,183 --> 00:54:51,825
BUT I TOLD THEM, I SAID, KEITH

1244
00:54:43,183 --> 00:54:51,825
IS A METHOD ACTOR.

1245
00:54:43,183 --> 00:54:51,825
HE'S NOT GOING TO WEAR A FAT

1246
00:54:51,825 --> 00:54:57,230
SUIT.

1247
00:54:51,825 --> 00:54:57,230
I REALLY KIND OF WISH YOU HAD

1248
00:54:51,825 --> 00:54:57,230
BROUGHT ME INTO THAT

1249
00:54:57,230 --> 00:54:59,899
CONVERSATION.

1250
00:54:57,230 --> 00:54:59,899
OH, REALLY?

1251
00:54:57,230 --> 00:54:59,899
THAT'S MY BAD, MAN.

1252
00:54:59,899 --> 00:55:04,204
I'M SORRY.

1253
00:54:59,899 --> 00:55:04,204
GUYS, THIS WHOLE THING IS MY BAD.

1254
00:55:04,204 --> 00:55:14,814
BUT LOOK, AT LEAST YOU GUYS ARE FREE.

1255
00:55:04,204 --> 00:55:14,814
YOU OKAY?

1256
00:55:14,814 --> 00:55:21,287
AT LEAST YOU GUYS ARE FREE TO DO

1257
00:55:14,814 --> 00:55:21,287
OTHER PROJECTS, RIGHT?

1258
00:55:14,814 --> 00:55:21,287
LIKE KEITH, YOU HAD AN OFFER FOR

1259
00:55:21,287 --> 00:55:33,066
A MARVEL MOVIE, RIGHT?

1260
00:55:21,287 --> 00:55:33,066
I THINK THAT SHIP HAS SAILED.

1261
00:55:21,287 --> 00:55:33,066
I'M NOT EXACTLY IN X-MEN SHAPE

1262
00:55:33,066 --> 00:55:35,468
RIGHT NOW.

1263
00:55:33,066 --> 00:55:35,468
WELL, SOMETHING ELSE WILL

1264
00:55:33,066 --> 00:55:35,468
COME ALONG.

1265
00:55:35,468 --> 00:55:41,241
WELL, I DO THIS ON ALL MY FILMS, GUYS.

1266
00:55:35,468 --> 00:55:41,241
ON OUR LAST DAY OF SET, WE ALL

1267
00:55:41,241 --> 00:55:45,078
SAY ONE THING THIS EXPERIENCE

1268
00:55:41,241 --> 00:55:45,078
GAVE US.

1269
00:55:41,241 --> 00:55:45,078
SO I'LL GO FIRST.

1270
00:55:45,078 --> 00:55:52,485
I HAVE 28 NEW FRIENDS.

1271
00:55:45,078 --> 00:55:52,485
I HAVE ONE HELL OF A STORY.

1272
00:55:45,078 --> 00:55:52,485
I HAVE A DEEPER RESPECT FOR

1273
00:55:52,485 --> 00:55:54,120
OUR CRAFT. SAME.

1274
00:55:52,485 --> 00:55:54,120
ALL RIGHT.

1275
00:55:54,120 --> 00:56:01,528
YOUR TURN, KEITH.

1276
00:55:54,120 --> 00:56:01,528
I HAVE--

1277
00:55:54,120 --> 00:56:01,528
NOT SEEN MY PENIS IN FOUR

1278
00:56:01,528 --> 00:56:09,336
MONTHS.

1279
00:56:01,528 --> 00:56:09,336
KEITH, YOU KNOW WHAT?

1280
00:56:01,528 --> 00:56:09,336
MAKE THAT 29 NEW FRIENDS FOR ME.

1281
00:56:09,336 --> 00:56:15,608
I WASN'T INCLUDED IN YOUR

1282
00:56:09,336 --> 00:56:15,608
ORIGINAL FRIEND COUNT?

1283
00:56:09,336 --> 00:56:15,608
HEY, DID THE STUDIO SAY WHY

1284
00:56:15,608 --> 00:56:22,282
THEY SHUT THE MOVIE DOWN?

1285
00:56:15,608 --> 00:56:22,282
OH, YOU'LL LOVE THIS.

1286
00:56:15,608 --> 00:56:22,282
THEY SAID THE SCRIPT IS ALMOST

1287
00:56:22,282 --> 00:56:29,055
WORD FOR WORD THE SAME AS THAT

1288
00:56:22,282 --> 00:56:29,055
BRENDAN FRASER MOVIE, THE WHALE.

1289
00:56:22,282 --> 00:56:29,055
I SAW IT.

1290
00:56:29,055 --> 00:56:33,560
BRENDAN FRASER IS GOING TO WIN

1291
00:56:29,055 --> 00:56:33,560
AN OSCAR.

1292
00:56:29,055 --> 00:56:33,560
OH, GOOD FOR HIM.

ONLY IF YOU'LL SPOT ME.

1338
00:59:47,921 --> 00:59:56,663
I ALREADY DID FROM ACROSS THE ROOM.

1339
00:59:47,921 --> 00:59:56,663
I LIKE YOUR SUIT.

1340
00:59:56,663 --> 01:00:01,468
I ALWAYS THOUGHT I WAS THE ONLY

1341
00:59:56,663 --> 01:00:01,468
ONE HERE WHO WORE ONE.

1342
00:59:56,663 --> 01:00:01,468
WELL, I'M COMING FROM A

1343
01:00:01,468 --> 01:00:04,204
WEDDING.

1344
01:00:01,468 --> 01:00:04,204
WHOSE?

1345
01:00:01,468 --> 01:00:04,204
MY OWN.

1346
01:00:04,204 --> 01:00:10,577
HER NAME IS ASHLEY OR SOMETHING.

1347
01:00:04,204 --> 01:00:10,577
SHE SOUNDS BEAUTIFUL.

1348
01:00:04,204 --> 01:00:10,577
WELL, SHE LOOKS UGLY.

1349
01:00:10,577 --> 01:00:16,316
SHE HAS A FACE FOR A KN-95.

1350
01:00:10,577 --> 01:00:16,316
THAT'S WHY I COME HERE, TO ESCAPE.

1351
01:00:16,316 --> 01:00:23,823
ME TOO.

1352
01:00:16,316 --> 01:00:23,823
AND THE MUSIC EXHILARATES ME SO.

1353
01:00:16,316 --> 01:00:23,823
CAN WE TURN IT UP, MORRIS?

1354
01:00:23,823 --> 01:00:33,433
OF COURSE, SIR.

1355
01:00:23,823 --> 01:00:33,433
THAT'S BEAUTIFUL.

1356
01:00:23,823 --> 01:00:33,433
WHAT IS THAT YOU'RE PLAYING?

1357
01:00:33,433 --> 01:00:43,043
A BIG PIANO, SIR.

1358
01:00:33,433 --> 01:00:43,043
AH, I THOUGHT SO.

1359
01:00:33,433 --> 01:00:43,043
SO IS IT LEG DAY?

1360
01:00:43,043 --> 01:00:47,213
I DON'T KNOW.

1361
01:00:43,043 --> 01:00:47,213
I DON'T CELEBRATE THAT IN MY CULTURE.

1362
01:00:47,213 --> 01:00:52,085
OF COURSE.

1363
01:00:47,213 --> 01:00:52,085
WELL, IT'S CHEAT DAY FOR ME.

1364
01:00:47,213 --> 01:00:52,085
DOES THAT MEAN--

1365
01:00:52,085 --> 01:00:57,157
I'M ALLOWED TO COMMIT

1366
01:00:52,085 --> 01:00:57,157
ADULTERY, YES.

1367
01:00:52,085 --> 01:00:57,157
I SHOULD TELL YOU I'M ALSO

1368
01:00:57,157 --> 01:01:02,729
MARRIED.

1369
01:00:57,157 --> 01:01:02,729
YES, I THINK OUR WIVES KNOW

1370
01:00:57,157 --> 01:01:02,729
EACH OTHER FROM THAT LESBIAN

1371
01:01:02,729 --> 01:01:06,166
RELATIONSHIP THEY'RE IN.

1372
01:01:02,729 --> 01:01:06,166
THAT'S RIGHT.

1373
01:01:02,729 --> 01:01:06,166
HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THAT?

1374
01:01:06,166 --> 01:01:12,672
I THINK IT'S DISGUSTING.

1375
01:01:06,166 --> 01:01:12,672
ONE PAIR OF BOOBIES IS BAD ENOUGH.

1376
01:01:12,672 --> 01:01:15,542
SAY, DO YOU HAVE A FAVORITE

1377
01:01:12,672 --> 01:01:15,542
MACHINE?

1378
01:01:12,672 --> 01:01:15,542
I LIKE THE ONE THAT MAKES THE

1379
01:01:15,542 --> 01:01:20,246
TOAST.

1380
01:01:15,542 --> 01:01:20,246
I MEANT ONE AT THE GYM. OH.

1381
01:01:20,246 --> 01:01:28,788
I GUESS IT'S A TIE BETWEEN THE

1382
01:01:20,246 --> 01:01:28,788
COBBLESTONE TREADMILL AND THE

1383
01:01:20,246 --> 01:01:28,788
STATIONARY VESPA.

1384
01:01:28,788 --> 01:01:37,997
HMM.

1385
01:01:28,788 --> 01:01:37,997
THIS GYM IS SO CLASSY IT SHOULD

1386
01:01:28,788 --> 01:01:37,997
BE CALLED JAMES.

1387
01:01:37,997 --> 01:01:44,471
NOW, EXCUSE ME.

1388
01:01:37,997 --> 01:01:44,471
I'M GOING TO USE THE ROWING MACHINE.

1389
01:01:44,471 --> 01:01:52,212
BOAT RIMES WITH FLOAT,

1390
01:01:44,471 --> 01:01:52,212
COINCIDENCE?

1391
01:01:44,471 --> 01:01:52,212

1392
01:01:52,212 --> 01:01:56,816
WOW.

1393
01:01:52,212 --> 01:01:56,816
LOOK AT YOU GO, GIRL.

1394
01:01:52,212 --> 01:01:56,816
THANKS FOR NOTICING.

1395
01:01:56,816 --> 01:02:02,555
I'VE REALLY BEEN GOING BEAST

1396
01:01:56,816 --> 01:02:02,555
MODE LATELY IN THAT I KEEP A

1397
01:01:56,816 --> 01:02:02,555
BEAUTIFUL ROSE UNDER A BELL JAR.

1398
01:02:02,555 --> 01:02:08,928
OF COURSE.

1399
01:02:02,555 --> 01:02:08,928
OH, SHOOT.

1400
01:02:02,555 --> 01:02:08,928
I FORGOT MY PROTEIN POWDER.

1401
01:02:08,928 --> 01:02:13,400
I BROUGHT SOME. AH.

1402
01:02:08,928 --> 01:02:13,400
MAY I BORROW?

1403
01:02:13,400 --> 01:02:19,305
OF COURSE.

1404
01:02:13,400 --> 01:02:19,305
HOW DO YOU TAKE IT?

1405
01:02:13,400 --> 01:02:19,305
HERE AND HERE.

1406
01:02:19,305 --> 01:02:24,077
GOOD.

1407
01:02:19,305 --> 01:02:24,077
THANK YOU.

1408
01:02:19,305 --> 01:02:24,077
ARE YOU GOING TO WIPE THE

1409
01:02:24,077 --> 01:02:26,112
MACHINE?

1410
01:02:24,077 --> 01:02:26,112
WIPE?

1411
01:02:24,077 --> 01:02:26,112
WHY?

1412
01:02:26,112 --> 01:02:34,454
DID IT DOO DOO?

1413
01:02:26,112 --> 01:02:34,454
DID IT DOO DOO, THAT SOUNDS LIKE

1414
01:02:26,112 --> 01:02:34,454
MORSE CODE.

1415
01:02:34,454 --> 01:02:39,292
WELL, I WAS IN THE ARMY. BTS.

1416
01:02:34,454 --> 01:02:39,292
AND I WAS IN THE NAVY.

1417
01:02:39,292 --> 01:02:45,398
RIHANNA.

1418
01:02:39,292 --> 01:02:45,398
I'VE NEVER ACTUALLY USED THAT

1419
01:02:39,292 --> 01:02:45,398
MACHINE BEFORE, BUT I LIKE HOW

1420
01:02:45,398 --> 01:02:53,173
THERE'S A POSTER THAT SHOWS YOU

1421
01:02:45,398 --> 01:02:53,173
HOW TO DO THE EXERCISE.

1422
01:02:45,398 --> 01:02:53,173
AH, IT LOOKS LIKE TWO FELLOWS

1423
01:02:53,173 --> 01:02:59,312
EXPLORING EACH OTHER'S BODIES.

1424
01:02:53,173 --> 01:02:59,312
IT'S HELPFUL EITHER WAY.

1425
01:02:53,173 --> 01:02:59,312
YOU KNOW, THIS PLACE CAN BE SO

1426
01:02:59,312 --> 01:03:01,081
SENSUAL.

1427
01:02:59,312 --> 01:03:01,081
LOOK, MY GYM CRUSH IS OVER THERE.

1428
01:03:01,081 --> 01:03:10,223

1429
01:03:01,081 --> 01:03:10,223
WHAT A HUNK.

1430
01:03:01,081 --> 01:03:10,223
THIS GYM REALLY IS A PLACE FOR

1431
01:03:10,223 --> 01:03:14,060
EVERYONE.

1432
01:03:10,223 --> 01:03:14,060
ROID BOYS, YOGA GIRLS, GYM RATS. LOOK.

1433
01:03:14,060 --> 01:03:23,570
THERE'S A GYM RAT OVER THERE. WOW.

1434
01:03:14,060 --> 01:03:23,570
WHAT A GREAT DAY AT THE MOST

1435
01:03:23,570 --> 01:03:27,941
BEAUTIFUL GYM IN THE WORLD.

1436
01:03:23,570 --> 01:03:27,941
I'M BEGINNING TO THINK I'VE MADE

1437
01:03:23,570 --> 01:03:27,941
A NEW BEST FRIEND.

1438
01:03:27,941 --> 01:03:33,446
AS HAVE I, FRIEND.

1439
01:03:27,941 --> 01:03:33,446
NOW SHALL WE GET BACK TO OUR

1440
01:03:27,941 --> 01:03:33,446
WORKOUT?

1441
01:03:33,446 --> 01:03:38,118
GREAT IDEA.

1442
01:03:33,446 --> 01:03:38,118
THERE'S NOTHING LIKE A GOOD

1443
01:03:33,446 --> 01:03:38,118
OLD-- OH, NO!

1444
01:03:38,118 --> 01:03:44,324
I TORE MY ACL.

1445
01:03:38,118 --> 01:03:44,324
WHAT DOES THAT STAND FOR?

1446
01:03:38,118 --> 01:03:44,324
MY ASS CRACK AND LEGS.

1447
01:03:44,324 --> 01:03:48,094
OH, NO.

1448
01:03:44,324 --> 01:03:48,094
I THINK WE'VE DONE ENOUGH FOR TODAY.

1449
01:03:48,094 --> 01:03:51,364
WE'VE ALREADY WORKED THE MOST

1450
01:03:48,094 --> 01:03:51,364
IMPORTANT MUSCLE.

1451
01:03:51,364 --> 01:03:55,101
THE PECTORALS?

1452
01:03:51,364 --> 01:03:55,101
CLOSE.

1453
01:03:51,364 --> 01:03:55,101
THE HEART.

1454
01:04:20,600 --> 01:04:24,296
JACK

1455
01:04:26,600 --> 01:04:29,903
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, ON

1456
01:04:22,395 --> 01:04:31,217
BEHALF OF EVERYBODY HERE AT SNL,

1457
01:04:31,217 --> 01:04:34,723
I WOULD LIKE TO PRESENT THIS
FIVE-TIMERS JACKET

01:04:34,723 --> 01:04:37,288

01:04:38,639 --> 01:04:42,756
I GOT YOU, BABY.

1460
01:04:48,802 --> 01:04:51,743
VERY NICE, VERY NICE.
