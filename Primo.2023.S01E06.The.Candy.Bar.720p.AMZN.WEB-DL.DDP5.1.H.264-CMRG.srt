1
00:00:01,797 --> 00:00:05,468
{\an8} So, let me warn you right now.

2
00:00:05,551 --> 00:00:08,304
Almost all of these this time
are intimacy related.

3
00:00:08,387 --> 00:00:09,764
Okay. Why?

4
00:00:09,847 --> 00:00:12,892
Well, it started
because  The Incredibles  was on TV,

5
00:00:12,975 --> 00:00:15,311
and Uncle Rollie said
that the mom was built right

6
00:00:15,394 --> 00:00:18,272
and then they all started talking
about it and you know how it goes.

7
00:00:18,356 --> 00:00:19,357
I got it.

8
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:22,818
Okay. So, what does
"foreplay of the soul" mean?

9
00:00:22,902 --> 00:00:25,446
Uncle Ryan said that whoever's working
the hardest during sex,

10
00:00:25,529 --> 00:00:26,947
that's where the baby's gonna be?

11
00:00:27,031 --> 00:00:28,574
Uncle Rollie said if you have sex,

12
00:00:28,658 --> 00:00:30,660
then the girl can get
on a trampoline afterward.

13
00:00:30,743 --> 00:00:33,871
So, Uncle Mondo also said
to only have sex during a full moon.

14
00:00:33,954 --> 00:00:36,248
Uncle Mike said
that if the girl's on top during sex,

15
00:00:36,332 --> 00:00:39,919
her egg can fall out of her
and into the man and get him pregnant.

16
00:00:40,002 --> 00:00:41,212
Uncle Rollie said... Uncle Mike said...

17
00:00:41,295 --> 00:00:42,838
Uncle Ryan said... Uncle Jay said...

18
00:00:42,922 --> 00:00:44,256
Uncle Rollie said... Uncle Ryan said...

19
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:48,219
Don't go to any of your uncles
about anything intimacy related ever,

20
00:00:48,302 --> 00:00:49,637
for the rest of your life.

21
00:00:57,186 --> 00:00:59,438
Where do I see myself in 10 years?

22
00:00:59,522 --> 00:01:02,566
Incredible question,
so thoughtful, thank you for asking.

23
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:05,569
Well, when my Uncle Rollie was 26,

24
00:01:05,653 --> 00:01:07,780
he got out of jail early
for good behavior.

25
00:01:07,863 --> 00:01:10,366
And when Mr. Shawn Jay-Z Carter was 26,

26
00:01:10,449 --> 00:01:11,867
he dropped  Reasonable Doubt.

27
00:01:11,951 --> 00:01:13,994
I'm aiming
for somewhere between those points.

28
00:01:15,204 --> 00:01:18,999
Well, that is terrific.

29
00:01:19,083 --> 00:01:21,836
You mentioned you come from struggle,
which they always eat up.

30
00:01:21,919 --> 00:01:24,880
You show you're interested in music
and you're goal-oriented.

31
00:01:24,964 --> 00:01:27,800
- Great college interview answer.
- Cool.

32
00:01:27,883 --> 00:01:30,553
Clean that up, and you've also got
a great start to an essay.

33
00:01:30,636 --> 00:01:32,138
Let's go to the board.

34
00:01:32,221 --> 00:01:35,808
Oh, you, you wanna work on the essay now?

35
00:01:35,891 --> 00:01:36,892
Yeah.

36
00:01:36,976 --> 00:01:39,687
I know we're running a little over
but I feel like we got momentum.

37
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:43,232
Uh, my friends are riding
a super skateboard

38
00:01:43,315 --> 00:01:45,317
and I'm supposed to meet them at noon.

39
00:01:45,401 --> 00:01:47,319
What's a super skateboard?

40
00:01:48,821 --> 00:01:50,531
It's like a giant piece of plywood.

41
00:01:50,614 --> 00:01:52,366
Nail a skateboard to each corner.

42
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:55,119
Bang, super skateboard.

43
00:01:55,202 --> 00:01:56,912
Shouldn't there be a skateboard
in the middle for support?

44
00:01:56,996 --> 00:01:58,330
We're not building
a space shuttle here, Rafa.

45
00:01:58,414 --> 00:02:00,920
We're trying to haul ass
down a hill and maybe get hurt.

46
00:02:01,542 --> 00:02:03,127
Meet us after your college class thing.

47
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:04,545
- Okay.
- Do you have a helmet?

48
00:02:04,628 --> 00:02:06,005
- No.
- Good.

49
00:02:06,088 --> 00:02:07,131
Yeah.

50
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:10,426
Rafa, there are two roads here,

51
00:02:10,509 --> 00:02:12,845
the metaphorical one
that you're on right now,

52
00:02:12,928 --> 00:02:14,805
which probably leads to college,

53
00:02:14,889 --> 00:02:17,266
and the literal one
that your friends are on

54
00:02:17,349 --> 00:02:19,351
which probably leads
to the emergency room.

55
00:02:20,519 --> 00:02:21,896
Which one sounds best?

56
00:02:23,189 --> 00:02:25,608
Uh, yeah. Okay.

57
00:02:25,691 --> 00:02:27,193
Let's get to work.

58
00:02:28,569 --> 00:02:30,112
Welcome back to Broken Home.

59
00:02:30,196 --> 00:02:31,697
Last week, our hosts, Mario and Courtney

60
00:02:31,781 --> 00:02:34,950
were rebuilding a hundred-year old
craftsman and their marriage.

61
00:02:35,034 --> 00:02:38,120
I have more faith in their marriage.
That craftsman clearly has dry rot.

62
00:02:38,204 --> 00:02:41,707
Hmm, dry rot can be overcome.
Emotional infidelity cannot.

63
00:02:41,791 --> 00:02:44,043
- What'd I miss?
- We're about to get the mold report.

64
00:02:44,126 --> 00:02:46,086
And also, Mario knows about the affair.

65
00:02:48,923 --> 00:02:50,257
- Pause it.
- Pause yourself.

66
00:02:51,592 --> 00:02:52,760
Hi, baby girl.

67
00:02:52,843 --> 00:02:55,262
Hi, daddy.
Can I have money for the ice cream truck?

68
00:02:55,346 --> 00:02:56,639
Sure. Get some money
out of the money coats.

69
00:02:56,722 --> 00:02:58,849
The petty cash one.

70
00:02:58,933 --> 00:03:00,226
- Money coats?
- Yeah,

71
00:03:00,309 --> 00:03:02,645
I got a whole new financial system.

72
00:03:02,728 --> 00:03:04,313
Checkered for checking,

73
00:03:04,396 --> 00:03:06,732
stripes for savings,

74
00:03:06,816 --> 00:03:09,568
Member's Only for making mom's
Toyota Tercel payments,

75
00:03:09,652 --> 00:03:13,364
vest for vacation,
and poncho for petty cash.

76
00:03:15,533 --> 00:03:18,410
Here. Start your own coats.

77
00:03:18,494 --> 00:03:22,540
You gotta stop doing this.
Money belongs in the bank.

78
00:03:22,623 --> 00:03:24,166
No. Banks are scams.

79
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:25,960
I like my money
in my house where it's safe.

80
00:03:26,043 --> 00:03:29,004
Safe? You buried it
in the backyard and it rotted.

81
00:03:29,088 --> 00:03:31,882
And then you hid it in the attic
and some owls use it to make a nest.

82
00:03:31,966 --> 00:03:33,509
Take this somewhere else.

83
00:03:33,592 --> 00:03:35,177
They just found out they have termites
and the affair

84
00:03:35,261 --> 00:03:37,346
Courtney was having
was with the exterminator.

85
00:03:38,347 --> 00:03:40,307
Can you open an account
like a normal human being?

86
00:03:40,391 --> 00:03:41,308
Let it go, Ryan.

87
00:03:41,392 --> 00:03:44,061
I'm not taking advice from someone
so young they can't even grow a beard.

88
00:03:44,144 --> 00:03:46,230
A mustache is a beard for the lip.

89
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:53,737
Hey, did you tell Julissa she could get
some money from the coat to buy ice cream

90
00:03:53,821 --> 00:03:54,822
Yes.

91
00:03:54,905 --> 00:03:56,949
Well,
she took all the poncho cash

92
00:03:57,032 --> 00:03:59,952
and bought $500 worth of Choco Tacos.

93
00:04:00,035 --> 00:04:03,122
Thank you, daddy. Thank you, daddy.
Thank you, daddy. Thank you, daddy.

94
00:04:05,916 --> 00:04:07,209
Shut up.

95
00:04:07,293 --> 00:04:08,919
Hey guys, wait up.

96
00:04:09,003 --> 00:04:11,005
We did wait for an hour.

97
00:04:11,088 --> 00:04:12,840
I guess you and your coat
were too busy at the news station

98
00:04:12,923 --> 00:04:14,466
getting ready to give the weather.

99
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:19,555
I'm sorry. Ms. Pedraza made me
do extra essay stuff in the college thing.

100
00:04:19,638 --> 00:04:22,433
What's your essay about? How
you're gonna be a virgin till you're 50?

101
00:04:22,516 --> 00:04:24,602
"And now for weather, we go to Rafa."

102
00:04:24,685 --> 00:04:28,731
"Thanks Miguel, it's looking like
it's gonna be very dry until I'm 50."

103
00:04:28,814 --> 00:04:31,191
You all done?
You get 'em all out?

104
00:04:31,275 --> 00:04:33,485
You need three people
for a super skateboard.

105
00:04:33,569 --> 00:04:35,237
We had to invite Carlos from homeroom.

106
00:04:35,321 --> 00:04:36,238
That dude's cool.

107
00:04:36,322 --> 00:04:37,865
He's already going bald.

108
00:04:38,991 --> 00:04:39,867
I thought he cut his hair like that.

109
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:41,160
No. Bald.

110
00:04:42,536 --> 00:04:43,662
Dude, that sucks.

111
00:04:45,998 --> 00:04:48,709
Harris, your mom wants you
to break down the boxes in the back

112
00:04:48,792 --> 00:04:49,919
and then stock the cooler.

113
00:04:50,002 --> 00:04:53,422
Ugh. When I inherit this place,
I'm getting rid of the cooler.

114
00:04:53,505 --> 00:04:56,008
No more ice.
Catch you guys later.

115
00:04:56,091 --> 00:04:59,136
Abolish ICE. Hmm. Get it?

116
00:04:59,219 --> 00:05:00,471
No, nerd.

117
00:05:01,764 --> 00:05:04,016
What is with you today, man?

118
00:05:04,099 --> 00:05:06,310
What's with me? What's with you?

119
00:05:06,393 --> 00:05:08,187
You've been MIA every weekend.

120
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:10,105
It's just you and Mrs. Pedraza
writing your book

121
00:05:10,189 --> 00:05:11,899
about what a perfect little boy
you are or whatever.

122
00:05:11,982 --> 00:05:14,193
All right. That, you know that
that's not what we're doing.

123
00:05:14,276 --> 00:05:16,111
I don't know anything.

124
00:05:27,206 --> 00:05:29,041
What are you doing?

125
00:05:32,878 --> 00:05:35,756
Hey, y'all stop right there.

126
00:05:36,882 --> 00:05:37,758
Go!

127
00:05:37,841 --> 00:05:41,387
I'm calling Drea! Oof!

128
00:05:42,972 --> 00:05:45,391
My mom is gonna cut my head off.

129
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:49,311
That's just gonna be her first move.
That's just how she's gonna start.

130
00:05:49,395 --> 00:05:51,146
It's only gonna get worse from there.

131
00:05:54,733 --> 00:05:55,859
I can't control my feet.

132
00:05:55,943 --> 00:05:58,946
I keep telling them not to walk
to my house and they won't listen.

133
00:06:00,781 --> 00:06:02,700
Why'd you take that candy bar?

134
00:06:02,783 --> 00:06:04,952
I don't know.
You just kept messing with me.

135
00:06:05,035 --> 00:06:07,663
It started to feel like back in the day
when you were always on me.

136
00:06:07,746 --> 00:06:08,747
I don't know.

137
00:06:09,748 --> 00:06:11,834
Here's what's gonna happen, all right?

138
00:06:11,917 --> 00:06:13,919
- Your mom, she's gonna lose your mind.
- Well, yeah.

139
00:06:14,003 --> 00:06:16,130
And she's gonna yell at me
for a minute and then she'll yell at you.

140
00:06:16,213 --> 00:06:17,464
And she'll send me home and my grandpa

141
00:06:17,548 --> 00:06:19,633
probably won't even really understand
what's going on.

142
00:06:19,717 --> 00:06:22,219
And we'll both be in trouble
for a while and that's it.

143
00:06:24,346 --> 00:06:28,809
We should get rid of the evidence.
Is there like a pizza oven around here?

144
00:06:28,892 --> 00:06:30,561
Or one of those junkyard crusher things,

145
00:06:30,644 --> 00:06:32,896
or I could tie it to a rock
and throw it in the river.

146
00:06:41,155 --> 00:06:42,781
That works.

147
00:06:46,618 --> 00:06:48,328
Both of you, sit.

148
00:07:00,841 --> 00:07:02,134
In my store...

149
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:04,887
my place of work...

150
00:07:06,472 --> 00:07:07,848
Do you have no respect for me?

151
00:07:09,058 --> 00:07:10,476
Answer me.

152
00:07:10,559 --> 00:07:11,393
- Of course...
- Uh, yeah.

153
00:07:11,477 --> 00:07:12,603
Close your mouths.

154
00:07:15,564 --> 00:07:16,857
Esther told me everything.

155
00:07:18,859 --> 00:07:21,820
First of all,
I am so disappointed in you, Miguel.

156
00:07:22,863 --> 00:07:25,324
Stealing? Stealing?

157
00:07:26,366 --> 00:07:28,952
How could you do that?
I mean, what were you thinking?

158
00:07:29,036 --> 00:07:32,456
What, why is that something
you would even consider?

159
00:07:32,539 --> 00:07:33,665
Answer me.

160
00:07:33,749 --> 00:07:35,292
- Uh, I, I...
- Close your mouth.

161
00:07:36,835 --> 00:07:37,878
And you,

162
00:07:39,338 --> 00:07:42,091
you just stood by and let Miguel do this?

163
00:07:42,174 --> 00:07:46,261
Um, you know better than that, Rafa.
You should have said something.

164
00:07:48,847 --> 00:07:52,768
I just can't believe you would
do something so stupid, Miguel.

165
00:07:54,561 --> 00:07:56,605
You coulda gotten into some real trouble.

166
00:07:56,688 --> 00:07:59,858
You coulda gotten Rafa
into real trouble for no reason.

167
00:08:03,195 --> 00:08:05,072
Do you have anything to say for yourself?

168
00:08:10,285 --> 00:08:11,453
No, ma'am.

169
00:08:12,621 --> 00:08:13,622
Good.

170
00:08:14,706 --> 00:08:16,583
You sit here and think about this

171
00:08:16,667 --> 00:08:18,961
while I figure out
what I'm gonna do with you.

172
00:08:26,051 --> 00:08:27,678
That went pretty well, I thought.

173
00:08:29,429 --> 00:08:30,639
Considering.

174
00:08:36,353 --> 00:08:39,565
I mean, Esther must have only seen you
take the candy bar and not me.

175
00:08:39,648 --> 00:08:40,691
I don't know.

176
00:08:40,774 --> 00:08:43,110
You gotta say something.
You didn't say anything.

177
00:08:43,193 --> 00:08:44,653
Well, to be fair, neither did you.

178
00:08:44,736 --> 00:08:46,822
Yeah, 'cause I don't snitch
on my friends.

179
00:08:46,905 --> 00:08:48,824
But we both did this.

180
00:08:48,907 --> 00:08:50,909
You shoulda told her you stole something,
too, so we're both in trouble.

181
00:08:50,993 --> 00:08:52,369
That's on you.

182
00:08:52,452 --> 00:08:54,913
I know. Sorry. It's my bad.

183
00:08:54,997 --> 00:08:58,208
It's, I just, I just panicked.
I'm new at crime.

184
00:08:59,293 --> 00:09:00,586
I'll tell her though.

185
00:09:00,669 --> 00:09:02,087
Miguel, kitchen, now.

186
00:09:04,798 --> 00:09:06,550
Sorry, I lied. I'm never telling her.

187
00:09:14,516 --> 00:09:19,813
Miguel, I decided what you did
earned a spin of the punishment wheel.

188
00:09:19,897 --> 00:09:20,772
Like a game?

189
00:09:20,856 --> 00:09:24,735
Yeah, like a game,
where every prize is pain.

190
00:09:26,653 --> 00:09:29,198
As long as you don't get
"Spreadsheet tutorial with Uncle Ryan,"

191
00:09:29,281 --> 00:09:30,908
you'll be mostly okay.
That's the worst one.

192
00:09:30,991 --> 00:09:34,328
But whatever you get, I'm gonna help.

193
00:09:34,411 --> 00:09:35,621
That's okay, Rafa.

194
00:09:35,704 --> 00:09:38,040
I'm the one
who screwed up so I'll do this myself.

195
00:09:44,296 --> 00:09:45,464
Hot Stone Therapy?

196
00:09:46,548 --> 00:09:47,716
That doesn't sound that bad.

197
00:09:49,009 --> 00:09:51,762
Move these rocks to that side of the yard.

198
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:55,590
Oh, now I get why it's bad.

199
00:09:56,183 --> 00:09:58,518
I'm gonna get my chair.
I'll be right back.

200
00:10:01,063 --> 00:10:03,482
Oh! Ah! They're hot!

201
00:10:03,565 --> 00:10:05,234
You were told they'd be hot.

202
00:10:18,622 --> 00:10:21,124
What's up, Primo? Cheese?

203
00:10:21,208 --> 00:10:22,209
No.

204
00:10:22,292 --> 00:10:24,378
- How about we take a walk?
- Why?

205
00:10:24,461 --> 00:10:27,047
I have errands to run
and I can use some company.

206
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:30,175
Grab your shoes
and see if you can find my shoes.

207
00:10:30,259 --> 00:10:34,846
I swear I took them off when I got here,
but I may not have been wearing any.

208
00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:36,515
You have some shoes I can borrow?

209
00:10:37,307 --> 00:10:38,777
What size do you wear?

210
00:10:39,935 --> 00:10:41,144
You don't know?

211
00:10:42,813 --> 00:10:45,440
First of all, thank you
for trusting me with your family security

212
00:10:45,524 --> 00:10:48,443
and tacitly acknowledging
that I am an adult with things to offer.

213
00:10:48,527 --> 00:10:52,364
As the senior account professional
currently scheduled to work today,

214
00:10:52,447 --> 00:10:55,409
you made the right decision
when it comes to your financial future.

215
00:10:55,492 --> 00:10:57,411
- This was a mistake.
- Okay. No, hold on.

216
00:10:57,494 --> 00:10:58,996
Hold on. Sit down.

217
00:10:59,079 --> 00:11:01,790
Okay.
Um, why'd you bring all your coats?

218
00:11:01,873 --> 00:11:04,668
You told me to bring my money.
My money's in the coats.

219
00:11:04,751 --> 00:11:07,754
Before we start,
all financial institutions

220
00:11:07,838 --> 00:11:10,465
are money grubbing pirates
that bank rob with fees and fraud.

221
00:11:10,549 --> 00:11:11,675
Got it.

222
00:11:11,758 --> 00:11:14,970
That being said,
I want an account for each coat category.

223
00:11:15,053 --> 00:11:16,471
Okay.

224
00:11:16,555 --> 00:11:18,473
Fill out this form for checking.

225
00:11:18,557 --> 00:11:20,851
Um, how much will you be depositing?

226
00:11:20,934 --> 00:11:24,313
There should be $1,847
in paper cash in the right pocket

227
00:11:24,396 --> 00:11:26,189
and ten dollars in coins
in the left pocket.

228
00:11:27,899 --> 00:11:28,942
Okay.

229
00:11:32,738 --> 00:11:35,157
Something interesting over here?
Eyes on your own money.

230
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:38,660
Okay. Sorry, Janice. Lunatic.

231
00:11:41,038 --> 00:11:44,541
Okay. You should, uh,
also open a savings account,

232
00:11:44,624 --> 00:11:48,128
a 529 plan for the girls
and maybe buy some MUNIs.

233
00:11:48,211 --> 00:11:50,797
- MUNIs?
- Yeah, it means Municipal Bonds.

234
00:11:50,881 --> 00:11:54,051
No lingo.
Anything with bank lingo I'm not doing.

235
00:11:54,134 --> 00:11:56,803
Don't try to swindle me
with your half words.

236
00:11:56,887 --> 00:11:59,431
Okay. Why don't you just be
real mad over there

237
00:11:59,514 --> 00:12:01,391
and let me just figure all this out?

238
00:12:04,603 --> 00:12:08,648
I'm taking this as collateral.
And keep Janice away from my coats.

239
00:12:08,732 --> 00:12:10,317
- She's got rat eyes.
- Okay.

240
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:14,488
Again, sorry, Janice.
I, I think it's your glasses.

241
00:12:14,571 --> 00:12:16,156
But you, you should get LASIK.

242
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:22,162
Do you know
how the punishment wheel was invented?

243
00:12:23,205 --> 00:12:25,957
Years ago, Rollie threw firecrackers
at what turned out

244
00:12:26,041 --> 00:12:29,294
to be a first communion or something.

245
00:12:29,378 --> 00:12:31,713
So Father Montoya tried to punish him

246
00:12:31,797 --> 00:12:33,757
by making him weed
the garden of the church

247
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,926
and, of course, Rollie got bored and he...

248
00:12:36,009 --> 00:12:40,472
he started smashing Jesuses and cactuses.

249
00:12:40,555 --> 00:12:41,681
So you know what I said?

250
00:12:41,765 --> 00:12:45,352
I said I'm gonna do what the church can't,
boom, punishment wheel.

251
00:12:49,272 --> 00:12:50,190
Done.

252
00:12:50,273 --> 00:12:51,400
Good job.

253
00:12:53,944 --> 00:12:57,280
You know what?
Now that I'm looking at it,

254
00:12:57,364 --> 00:12:59,950
I actually think these rocks
should be moved to the backyard.

255
00:13:00,033 --> 00:13:01,284
But you just said...

256
00:13:01,368 --> 00:13:02,411
Forget what I said before.

257
00:13:03,495 --> 00:13:04,621
Get to work.

258
00:13:07,082 --> 00:13:08,375
Here we go, first stop.

259
00:13:09,376 --> 00:13:11,586
Whose house is this?
I don't know.

260
00:13:12,629 --> 00:13:15,132
But I saw this plant on my walk
every day and it needed to be cared for,

261
00:13:15,215 --> 00:13:17,134
so I started watering it.

262
00:13:17,217 --> 00:13:19,469
Cool. Are we done? Can we go home now?

263
00:13:21,346 --> 00:13:24,599
I keep this here
so the sprinklers fill it at night.

264
00:13:35,986 --> 00:13:38,738
Oh, okay. I get it.

265
00:13:38,822 --> 00:13:40,949
This is a metaphor.
That's what you're doing?

266
00:13:42,492 --> 00:13:45,245
So, am I the plant?
Am I the water?

267
00:13:47,289 --> 00:13:48,582
Am I the can?

268
00:13:48,665 --> 00:13:50,000
Just an errand.

269
00:13:51,376 --> 00:13:53,295
Check the trash can,
see if there's any food.

270
00:13:58,049 --> 00:14:00,677
There's half a bag of moldy bread.

271
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,554
Perfect. Grab it.

272
00:14:02,637 --> 00:14:03,847
You grab it.

273
00:14:09,394 --> 00:14:13,315
Every time I hang out with this guy,
you gotta dig through a trash can.

274
00:14:20,113 --> 00:14:21,239
Almost done.

275
00:14:21,323 --> 00:14:24,784
Uh, just sign this
for the 529 college fund, and we're good.

276
00:14:26,953 --> 00:14:29,623
Feels weird knowing there's no money
in all those coats.

277
00:14:29,706 --> 00:14:32,626
And I'd say it's weird
that there was money in any of them ever.

278
00:14:32,709 --> 00:14:34,836
All right. You're all set.

279
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:36,880
Welcome to adulthood,
my 40-year-old brother.

280
00:14:38,256 --> 00:14:39,799
Let me see my money one more time.

281
00:14:39,883 --> 00:14:43,595
Okay. There you go.

282
00:14:43,678 --> 00:14:47,641
No. The actual money I gave you.
The actual cash. Where is it?

283
00:14:47,724 --> 00:14:50,769
It's in here, you weirdo.
It's in the bank.

284
00:14:50,852 --> 00:14:52,312
I don't like this.

285
00:14:52,395 --> 00:14:54,898
I like holding it.
I like physically knowing where it is.

286
00:14:54,981 --> 00:14:56,691
It's... Jesus, man.

287
00:14:56,775 --> 00:14:59,444
The vault is in the back.
That's where they keep the cash.

288
00:14:59,528 --> 00:15:00,862
Vaults get robbed.

289
00:15:00,946 --> 00:15:02,489
Yeah. And so do closets.

290
00:15:02,572 --> 00:15:05,617
Yeah. And you got robbed earlier today
by your nine-year-old daughter.

291
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:10,789
So, anytime I want, I can go to the ATM
and get cash out to pay my crew, right?

292
00:15:10,872 --> 00:15:13,667
Yes. As long as you don't need
more than $800 per day.

293
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:15,293
That's the ATM limit.

294
00:15:15,377 --> 00:15:18,588
I definitely need more than that.
Lots of my guys gotta get paid in cash.

295
00:15:18,672 --> 00:15:21,633
I can't be coming here five days in a row
in order to get enough out to pay them.

296
00:15:21,716 --> 00:15:24,511
Okay. No problem.
We'll set you up with direct deposit.

297
00:15:24,594 --> 00:15:26,555
This is exactly what I was afraid of.

298
00:15:26,638 --> 00:15:28,765
I don't know
how I let you talk me into this.

299
00:15:28,848 --> 00:15:32,102
I didn't talk you into anything.
Stop acting like I'm trying to hustle you.

300
00:15:32,185 --> 00:15:33,478
No.

301
00:15:33,562 --> 00:15:35,730
Close all these accounts
and give me my money back.

302
00:15:35,814 --> 00:15:38,275
Put the money back
in those coats, exactly how it was,

303
00:15:38,358 --> 00:15:40,986
including the $10 in coins
that I had in the left pocket.

304
00:15:43,738 --> 00:15:45,323
I'll be in the parking lot.

305
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:47,867
The rule is "one per customer."

306
00:15:47,951 --> 00:15:51,371
And you're not even a customer!

307
00:15:52,747 --> 00:15:55,292
What, Janice? What?

308
00:15:57,335 --> 00:15:58,420
Rat eyes.

309
00:16:00,213 --> 00:16:03,216
Now, Mike, he needed some discipline.

310
00:16:04,426 --> 00:16:09,681
He sold my TV to get some extra money
to buy what he swore were dinosaur eggs.

311
00:16:09,764 --> 00:16:12,267
This was right after  Jurassic World
came out.

312
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:15,478
Truth be told, I, I kind of thought
they were dinosaur eggs, too.

313
00:16:15,562 --> 00:16:17,522
Turns out, they were just smooth rocks.

314
00:16:18,773 --> 00:16:21,234
So, that's how
this particular punishment was born.

315
00:16:22,402 --> 00:16:25,363
There.

316
00:16:25,447 --> 00:16:27,991
Done. Again.

317
00:16:29,409 --> 00:16:32,912
You know what? I hate it.

318
00:16:32,996 --> 00:16:37,334
I think I was right the first time.
Move these back to the front yard.

319
00:16:37,417 --> 00:16:40,003
No. Nah. I'm not doing it.

320
00:16:40,086 --> 00:16:41,880
- I'm done.
- Excuse me?

321
00:16:41,963 --> 00:16:43,715
I've been moving these rocks all day.

322
00:16:43,798 --> 00:16:47,302
Yeah.
Because that's your punishment.

323
00:16:47,385 --> 00:16:48,970
Because you stole something

324
00:16:49,054 --> 00:16:51,306
and we don't do that
in this house, Miguel.

325
00:16:53,767 --> 00:16:58,104
Now, pick up these rocks
and move them back to the front yard.

326
00:17:12,994 --> 00:17:14,120
Thank you.

327
00:17:14,204 --> 00:17:16,539
I'll be in the house.
Come see me when you're done.

328
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:28,218
Do you know who owns these chickens?
No.

329
00:17:28,301 --> 00:17:31,221
It's a good feeling,
isn't it, feeding them?

330
00:17:31,304 --> 00:17:33,807
You and this chicken are connected now.

331
00:17:33,890 --> 00:17:36,434
I don't wanna be connected to a chicken.

332
00:17:36,518 --> 00:17:38,687
What's the matter, Primo?

333
00:17:38,770 --> 00:17:41,856
Your hands are empty,
but you seem to be carrying a lot.

334
00:17:43,775 --> 00:17:45,610
It just sucks that Miguel's in trouble.

335
00:17:46,695 --> 00:17:48,530
- That's his thing, though, right?
- Yeah.

336
00:17:48,613 --> 00:17:50,490
Or... no.

337
00:17:52,367 --> 00:17:54,452
I don't know.

338
00:17:54,536 --> 00:17:56,863
Technically, I was with him.

339
00:17:59,207 --> 00:18:02,460
Well, don't be so hard on yourself.
There's nothing you can do about it now.

340
00:18:03,586 --> 00:18:04,879
Bread?

341
00:18:04,963 --> 00:18:06,840
No. It's moldy.

342
00:18:08,466 --> 00:18:10,385
Mold is just organic penicillin.

343
00:18:10,468 --> 00:18:13,430
Uncle Mondo, mold and penicillin
are not the same thing.

344
00:18:13,513 --> 00:18:16,725
Well, I've eaten a lot of mold
and I've never had an infection.

345
00:18:16,808 --> 00:18:18,192
You absolutely have.

346
00:18:19,853 --> 00:18:24,566
You know what? I'm done.
I just wanna go home, play video games.

347
00:18:24,649 --> 00:18:25,817
Okay.

348
00:18:30,363 --> 00:18:32,198
Okay. I get it.

349
00:18:32,282 --> 00:18:35,326
You want me to go home
and play video games

350
00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:37,996
'cause you know
I usually play video games with Miguel.

351
00:18:39,247 --> 00:18:41,124
I just figured out your whole plan, man.

352
00:18:41,207 --> 00:18:42,625
- My plan?
- Yeah.

353
00:18:42,709 --> 00:18:45,003
For you to do the thing
you said you wanted to do?

354
00:18:45,086 --> 00:18:47,505
Oh. And you'd love that, wouldn't you?

355
00:18:47,589 --> 00:18:49,674
Of course, I'd love it if you were happy.

356
00:18:49,758 --> 00:18:52,886
You're sick, you know that?
I should've seen this coming.

357
00:18:52,969 --> 00:18:58,183
Typical Uncle Mondo just trying to make
sure everyone's happy and full of love.

358
00:18:58,266 --> 00:18:59,642
You know what?

359
00:18:59,726 --> 00:19:03,938
It is not my fault that Miguel
stole that candy bar from the store, okay?

360
00:19:04,022 --> 00:19:07,901
I didn't make him do it.
I mean, I'm not perfect.

361
00:19:07,984 --> 00:19:11,321
I've done things that are wrong.
Yeah. And some of those things

362
00:19:11,404 --> 00:19:14,199
were immediately before the things
that he did.

363
00:19:14,282 --> 00:19:17,160
But maybe I wanna feel bad
about those things.

364
00:19:17,243 --> 00:19:19,454
Maybe that's my "journey."

365
00:19:21,748 --> 00:19:25,585
Get away from me, chicken!
I'm not your friend!

366
00:19:25,668 --> 00:19:27,045
No! No!

367
00:19:39,516 --> 00:19:41,851
- I know what you're gonna say.
- Do you have any Fritos?

368
00:19:41,935 --> 00:19:44,938
Oh. I guess I didn't know
what you were gonna say.

369
00:19:45,021 --> 00:19:46,064
It's all right.

370
00:19:46,147 --> 00:19:48,149
I know you're going
through something heavy,

371
00:19:48,233 --> 00:19:49,609
but also, I want some Fritos.

372
00:19:51,736 --> 00:19:53,696
I did something crappy to Miguel.

373
00:19:55,949 --> 00:19:58,201
I screwed up and you figured it out.

374
00:20:00,662 --> 00:20:01,871
How'd you know?

375
00:20:01,955 --> 00:20:04,541
I didn't know.
But it was pretty obvious

376
00:20:04,624 --> 00:20:07,836
you had 500 pounds of pain
sitting on your chest.

377
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:12,090
All I did was show you a few acts
of caring and love, and attention,

378
00:20:12,173 --> 00:20:15,218
and figured that would help you
confront whatever was causing you pain.

379
00:20:16,344 --> 00:20:18,346
So, how do I fix it?

380
00:20:18,429 --> 00:20:21,516
Well, the longer you take to apologize,
the harder it gets,

381
00:20:21,599 --> 00:20:26,396
so let's get off this wall, head home,
make a quick stop for Fritos and then...

382
00:20:26,479 --> 00:20:27,564
I don't have any money.

383
00:20:27,647 --> 00:20:30,275
Let's get off this wall,
head home, and you can make it right.

384
00:20:35,822 --> 00:20:38,032
I also feel bad
about yelling at that chicken.

385
00:20:39,284 --> 00:20:42,453
What took you so long?
I ate like half those lollipops.

386
00:20:42,537 --> 00:20:46,040
Janice had to refill the jar.
Thanks, Janice.

387
00:20:48,001 --> 00:20:49,127
We got to know each other.

388
00:20:49,210 --> 00:20:52,213
Turns out she's a lovely person
and she doesn't care for you at all.

389
00:20:52,297 --> 00:20:55,049
Yeah. Well,
all the money's back in the coats.

390
00:20:55,133 --> 00:20:57,677
You can take them home and reestablish
the Burlington Cash Factory,

391
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:58,970
if that's what you want.

392
00:20:59,053 --> 00:21:00,638
- It is.
- Nope. Wait.

393
00:21:02,015 --> 00:21:05,018
I get that your job
is to run your business,

394
00:21:05,101 --> 00:21:06,811
and pay your workers on time.

395
00:21:06,895 --> 00:21:10,899
But my job is to keep
people's money safe, and I'm good at it.

396
00:21:10,982 --> 00:21:12,525
I know what I'm doing here, Jay.

397
00:21:14,319 --> 00:21:16,988
Fine. Maybe there's a compromise.

398
00:21:17,071 --> 00:21:19,365
There is. And I already found it.

399
00:21:20,742 --> 00:21:22,535
I swear to God, Janice.

400
00:21:26,414 --> 00:21:29,918
Safety deposit box.
You can come in during bank hours

401
00:21:30,001 --> 00:21:32,003
and take out as much as you want,
no limit.

402
00:21:32,086 --> 00:21:36,341
It's actual regular cash.
And only you have access, so it's safe.

403
00:21:36,424 --> 00:21:39,218
But I did leave
the money in the girls' college fund.

404
00:21:40,303 --> 00:21:41,387
That work for you?

405
00:21:46,184 --> 00:21:47,352
You did good.

406
00:21:51,189 --> 00:21:54,442
One question, what if,
and I know this is highly unlikely...

407
00:21:54,525 --> 00:21:56,569
Ocean's Eleven  cannot happen here.

408
00:21:56,653 --> 00:21:58,613
Okay. But what if...

409
00:21:58,696 --> 00:22:00,073
Neither can  The Town.

410
00:22:00,156 --> 00:22:02,325
Good. But...

411
00:22:02,408 --> 00:22:04,744
Jay, no movie-style bank heists
is going to happen

412
00:22:04,827 --> 00:22:06,829
in this regional San Antonio bank branch.

413
00:22:10,124 --> 00:22:13,086
I'm done.

414
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:19,634
And I'm sorry for everything.

415
00:22:21,678 --> 00:22:26,474
And I just wanted to say
thank you for all the meals,

416
00:22:26,557 --> 00:22:29,018
and for letting me sleepover
all those times.

417
00:22:30,144 --> 00:22:32,271
Why are you talking
like you're never gonna see me again?

418
00:22:32,355 --> 00:22:34,857
I don't know, 'cause I'm not, right?

419
00:22:34,941 --> 00:22:36,943
It's what you said.
Since I stole that thing.

420
00:22:37,026 --> 00:22:38,194
That's what you said.

421
00:22:45,868 --> 00:22:50,248
Miguel, when I said,
"We don't do that in this house,"

422
00:22:50,331 --> 00:22:51,916
you're included in the "we."

423
00:22:53,710 --> 00:22:55,461
Do you remember when you and I first met?

424
00:22:57,005 --> 00:22:59,173
You and Rafa were in the sixth grade.

425
00:22:59,257 --> 00:23:03,261
I never had the mom of the kid
I was bullying come to my house before.

426
00:23:03,344 --> 00:23:05,096
I thought you were gonna be so mad at me.

427
00:23:05,179 --> 00:23:06,222
I was.

428
00:23:06,305 --> 00:23:10,518
But then you said
all those nice things about me

429
00:23:10,601 --> 00:23:14,147
to my grandparents,
and, and invited me over for, for dinner.

430
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:15,648
That's right.

431
00:23:15,732 --> 00:23:19,652
That invitation is still open, Miguel.
Always will be.

432
00:23:21,112 --> 00:23:23,531
I am furious at you

433
00:23:23,614 --> 00:23:25,742
and that's why you spun
the punishment wheel.

434
00:23:26,993 --> 00:23:28,870
But that doesn't change the other things.

435
00:23:30,705 --> 00:23:32,206
Do you understand what I'm saying?

436
00:23:33,791 --> 00:23:36,377
Yeah. I think so.

437
00:23:36,461 --> 00:23:37,420
Good.

438
00:23:38,504 --> 00:23:40,673
Don't steal again.

439
00:23:40,757 --> 00:23:42,175
Yes, ma'am.

440
00:23:53,936 --> 00:23:55,396
That was my water.

441
00:23:56,981 --> 00:23:58,024
Oh, my God.

442
00:24:05,782 --> 00:24:06,908
Hey.

443
00:24:08,326 --> 00:24:10,161
Uh, are you done moving those rocks?

444
00:24:10,244 --> 00:24:14,749
Yeah. Yeah. I was, uh,
I was just talking to your mom.

445
00:24:16,292 --> 00:24:18,753
She's cool.
Yeah.

446
00:24:19,921 --> 00:24:23,716
Hey. So, I'm sorry about earlier.

447
00:24:25,259 --> 00:24:26,427
I didn't have your back.

448
00:24:28,471 --> 00:24:30,765
Yeah, that sucked.

449
00:24:32,058 --> 00:24:33,184
But I get it.

450
00:24:35,103 --> 00:24:37,563
I'm, I'm sorry
that I was messing with you.

451
00:24:37,647 --> 00:24:39,982
No. No, man. Don't worry about it.

452
00:24:41,734 --> 00:24:44,028
Me, I'm, I'm sorry
that I was late to hang out earlier.

453
00:24:44,112 --> 00:24:48,616
Yeah, yeah. No.
The college thing is important.

454
00:24:50,118 --> 00:24:53,496
Damn, we got a lot of stuff
to apologize for today.

455
00:24:53,579 --> 00:24:54,997
Yeah.

456
00:24:55,706 --> 00:25:00,378
Hey. So, are you doing anything now?
You wanna hang out?

457
00:25:03,756 --> 00:25:04,924
What do you wanna do?

458
00:25:13,891 --> 00:25:14,892
Yes.

459
00:25:17,979 --> 00:25:20,189
You're right.
The extra board makes it more secure.

460
00:25:20,273 --> 00:25:22,483
Yeah. We're definitely gonna crash
and get hurt though.

461
00:25:22,567 --> 00:25:24,193
No doubt. Let's do it.

462
00:25:24,277 --> 00:25:25,444
Yeah.

463
00:25:33,077 --> 00:25:37,123
Oh, my God, we're going
like 90 miles an hour right now, dude.

464
00:25:39,398 --> 00:25:41,823
HOURS

465
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:53,389
Oh, raspberries.
