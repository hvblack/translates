1
00:00:01,877 --> 00:00:05,548
{\an8} So, let me warn you right now.

2
00:00:05,631 --> 00:00:08,384
Almost all of these this time
are intimacy related.

3
00:00:08,467 --> 00:00:09,844
Okay. Why?

4
00:00:09,927 --> 00:00:12,972
Well, it started
because  The Incredibles  was on TV,

5
00:00:13,055 --> 00:00:15,391
and Uncle Rollie said
that the mom was built right

6
00:00:15,474 --> 00:00:18,352
and then they all started talking
about it and you know how it goes.

7
00:00:18,436 --> 00:00:19,437
I got it.

8
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:22,898
Okay. So, what does
"foreplay of the soul" mean?

9
00:00:22,982 --> 00:00:25,526
Uncle Ryan said that whoever's working
the hardest during sex,

10
00:00:25,609 --> 00:00:27,027
that's where the baby's gonna be?

11
00:00:27,111 --> 00:00:28,654
Uncle Rollie said if you have sex,

12
00:00:28,738 --> 00:00:30,740
then the girl can get
on a trampoline afterward.

13
00:00:30,823 --> 00:00:33,951
So, Uncle Mondo also said
to only have sex during a full moon.

14
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:36,328
Uncle Mike said
that if the girl's on top during sex,

15
00:00:36,412 --> 00:00:39,999
her egg can fall out of her
and into the man and get him pregnant.

16
00:00:40,082 --> 00:00:41,292
Uncle Rollie said... Uncle Mike said...

17
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:42,918
Uncle Ryan said... Uncle Jay said...

18
00:00:43,002 --> 00:00:44,336
Uncle Rollie said... Uncle Ryan said...

19
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:48,299
Don't go to any of your uncles
about anything intimacy related ever,

20
00:00:48,382 --> 00:00:49,717
for the rest of your life.

21
00:00:57,266 --> 00:00:59,518
Where do I see myself in 10 years?

22
00:00:59,602 --> 00:01:02,646
Incredible question,
so thoughtful, thank you for asking.

23
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:05,649
Well, when my Uncle Rollie was 26,

24
00:01:05,733 --> 00:01:07,860
he got out of jail early
for good behavior.

25
00:01:07,943 --> 00:01:10,446
And when Mr. Shawn Jay-Z Carter was 26,

26
00:01:10,529 --> 00:01:11,947
he dropped  Reasonable Doubt.

27
00:01:12,031 --> 00:01:14,074
I'm aiming
for somewhere between those points.

28
00:01:15,284 --> 00:01:19,079
Well, that is terrific.

29
00:01:19,163 --> 00:01:21,916
You mentioned you come from struggle,
which they always eat up.

30
00:01:21,999 --> 00:01:24,960
You show you're interested in music
and you're goal-oriented.

31
00:01:25,044 --> 00:01:27,880
- Great college interview answer.
- Cool.

32
00:01:27,963 --> 00:01:30,633
Clean that up, and you've also got
a great start to an essay.

33
00:01:30,716 --> 00:01:32,218
Let's go to the board.

34
00:01:32,301 --> 00:01:35,888
Oh, you, you wanna work on the essay now?

35
00:01:35,971 --> 00:01:36,972
Yeah.

36
00:01:37,056 --> 00:01:39,767
I know we're running a little over
but I feel like we got momentum.

37
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:43,312
Uh, my friends are riding
a super skateboard

38
00:01:43,395 --> 00:01:45,397
and I'm supposed to meet them at noon.

39
00:01:45,481 --> 00:01:47,399
What's a super skateboard?

40
00:01:48,901 --> 00:01:50,611
It's like a giant piece of plywood.

41
00:01:50,694 --> 00:01:52,446
Nail a skateboard to each corner.

42
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:55,199
Bang, super skateboard.

43
00:01:55,282 --> 00:01:56,992
Shouldn't there be a skateboard
in the middle for support?

44
00:01:57,076 --> 00:01:58,410
We're not building
a space shuttle here, Rafa.

45
00:01:58,494 --> 00:02:00,371
We're trying to haul ass
down a hill and maybe get hurt.

46
00:02:00,454 --> 00:02:01,539
Yeah.

47
00:02:01,622 --> 00:02:03,207
Meet us after your college class thing.

48
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:04,625
- Okay.
- Do you have a helmet?

49
00:02:04,708 --> 00:02:06,085
- No.
- Good.

50
00:02:06,168 --> 00:02:07,211
Yeah.

51
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:10,506
Rafa, there are two roads here,

52
00:02:10,589 --> 00:02:12,925
the metaphorical one
that you're on right now,

53
00:02:13,008 --> 00:02:14,885
which probably leads to college,

54
00:02:14,969 --> 00:02:17,346
and the literal one
that your friends are on

55
00:02:17,429 --> 00:02:19,431
which probably leads
to the emergency room.

56
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:21,976
Which one sounds best?

57
00:02:23,269 --> 00:02:25,688
Uh, yeah. Okay.

58
00:02:25,771 --> 00:02:27,273
Let's get to work.

59
00:02:28,649 --> 00:02:30,192
Welcome back to Broken Home.

60
00:02:30,276 --> 00:02:31,777
Last week, our hosts, Mario and Courtney

61
00:02:31,861 --> 00:02:35,030
were rebuilding a hundred-year old
craftsman and their marriage.

62
00:02:35,114 --> 00:02:38,200
I have more faith in their marriage.
That craftsman clearly has dry rot.

63
00:02:38,284 --> 00:02:41,787
Hmm, dry rot can be overcome.
Emotional infidelity cannot.

64
00:02:41,871 --> 00:02:44,123
- What'd I miss?
- We're about to get the mold report.

65
00:02:44,206 --> 00:02:46,166
And also, Mario knows about the affair.

66
00:02:49,003 --> 00:02:50,337
- Pause it.
- Pause yourself.

67
00:02:50,421 --> 00:02:51,589
Uh-hmm.

68
00:02:51,672 --> 00:02:52,840
Hi, baby girl.

69
00:02:52,923 --> 00:02:55,342
Hi, daddy.
Can I have money for the ice cream truck?

70
00:02:55,426 --> 00:02:56,719
Sure. Get some money
out of the money coats.

71
00:02:56,802 --> 00:02:58,929
The petty cash one.

72
00:02:59,013 --> 00:03:00,306
- Money coats?
- Yeah,

73
00:03:00,389 --> 00:03:02,725
I got a whole new financial system.

74
00:03:02,808 --> 00:03:04,393
Checkered for checking,

75
00:03:04,476 --> 00:03:06,812
stripes for savings,

76
00:03:06,896 --> 00:03:09,648
Member's Only for making mom's
Toyota Tercel payments,

77
00:03:09,732 --> 00:03:13,444
vest for vacation,
and poncho for petty cash.

78
00:03:15,613 --> 00:03:18,490
Here. Start your own coats.

79
00:03:18,574 --> 00:03:22,620
You gotta stop doing this.
Money belongs in the bank.

80
00:03:22,703 --> 00:03:24,246
No. Banks are scams.

81
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:26,040
I like my money
in my house where it's safe.

82
00:03:26,123 --> 00:03:29,084
Safe? You buried it
in the backyard and it rotted.

83
00:03:29,168 --> 00:03:31,962
And then you hid it in the attic
and some owls use it to make a nest.

84
00:03:32,046 --> 00:03:33,589
Take this somewhere else.

85
00:03:33,672 --> 00:03:35,257
They just found out they have termites
and the affair

86
00:03:35,341 --> 00:03:37,426
Courtney was having
was with the exterminator.

87
00:03:38,427 --> 00:03:40,387
Can you open an account
like a normal human being?

88
00:03:40,471 --> 00:03:41,388
Let it go, Ryan.

89
00:03:41,472 --> 00:03:44,141
I'm not taking advice from someone
so young they can't even grow a beard.

90
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:46,310
A mustache is a beard for the lip.

91
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:53,817
Hey, did you tell Julissa she could get
some money from the coat to buy ice cream

92
00:03:53,901 --> 00:03:54,902
Yes.

93
00:03:54,985 --> 00:03:57,029
Well,
she took all the poncho cash

94
00:03:57,112 --> 00:04:00,032
and bought $500 worth of Choco Tacos.

95
00:04:00,115 --> 00:04:03,202
Thank you, daddy. Thank you, daddy.
Thank you, daddy. Thank you, daddy.

96
00:04:05,996 --> 00:04:07,289
Shut up.

97
00:04:07,373 --> 00:04:08,999
Hey guys, wait up.

98
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:11,085
We did wait for an hour.

99
00:04:11,168 --> 00:04:12,920
I guess you and your coat
were too busy at the news station

100
00:04:13,003 --> 00:04:14,546
getting ready to give the weather.

101
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:19,635
I'm sorry. Ms. Pedraza made me
do extra essay stuff in the college thing.

102
00:04:19,718 --> 00:04:22,513
What's your essay about? How
you're gonna be a virgin till you're 50?

103
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:24,682
"And now for weather, we go to Rafa."

104
00:04:24,765 --> 00:04:28,811
"Thanks Miguel, it's looking like
it's gonna be very dry until I'm 50."

105
00:04:28,894 --> 00:04:31,271
You all done?
You get 'em all out?

106
00:04:31,355 --> 00:04:33,565
You need three people
for a super skateboard.

107
00:04:33,649 --> 00:04:35,317
We had to invite Carlos from homeroom.

108
00:04:35,401 --> 00:04:36,318
That dude's cool.

109
00:04:36,402 --> 00:04:37,945
He's already going bald.

110
00:04:39,071 --> 00:04:39,947
I thought he cut his hair like that.

111
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:41,240
No. Bald.

112
00:04:42,616 --> 00:04:43,742
Dude, that sucks.

113
00:04:46,078 --> 00:04:48,789
Harris, your mom wants you
to break down the boxes in the back

114
00:04:48,872 --> 00:04:49,999
and then stock the cooler.

115
00:04:50,082 --> 00:04:53,502
Ugh. When I inherit this place,
I'm getting rid of the cooler.

116
00:04:53,585 --> 00:04:56,088
No more ice.
Catch you guys later.

117
00:04:56,171 --> 00:04:59,216
Abolish ICE. Hmm. Get it?

118
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:00,551
No, nerd.

119
00:05:01,844 --> 00:05:04,096
What is with you today, man?

120
00:05:04,179 --> 00:05:06,390
What's with me? What's with you?

121
00:05:06,473 --> 00:05:08,267
You've been MIA every weekend.

122
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:10,185
It's just you and Mrs. Pedraza
writing your book

123
00:05:10,269 --> 00:05:11,979
about what a perfect little boy
you are or whatever.

124
00:05:12,062 --> 00:05:14,273
All right. That, you know that
that's not what we're doing.

125
00:05:14,356 --> 00:05:16,191
I don't know anything.

126
00:05:27,286 --> 00:05:29,121
What are you doing?

127
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:35,836
Hey, y'all stop right there.

128
00:05:36,962 --> 00:05:37,838
Go!

129
00:05:37,921 --> 00:05:41,467
I'm calling Drea! Oof!

130
00:05:43,052 --> 00:05:45,471
My mom is gonna cut my head off.

131
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:49,391
That's just gonna be her first move.
That's just how she's gonna start.

132
00:05:49,475 --> 00:05:51,226
It's only gonna get worse from there.

133
00:05:54,813 --> 00:05:55,939
I can't control my feet.

134
00:05:56,023 --> 00:05:59,026
I keep telling them not to walk
to my house and they won't listen.

135
00:06:00,861 --> 00:06:02,780
Why'd you take that candy bar?

136
00:06:02,863 --> 00:06:05,032
I don't know.
You just kept messing with me.

137
00:06:05,115 --> 00:06:07,743
It started to feel like back in the day
when you were always on me.

138
00:06:07,826 --> 00:06:08,827
I don't know.

139
00:06:09,828 --> 00:06:11,914
Here's what's gonna happen, all right?

140
00:06:11,997 --> 00:06:13,999
- Your mom, she's gonna lose your mind.
- Well, yeah.

141
00:06:14,083 --> 00:06:16,210
And she's gonna yell at me
for a minute and then she'll yell at you.

142
00:06:16,293 --> 00:06:17,544
And she'll send me home and my grandpa

143
00:06:17,628 --> 00:06:19,713
probably won't even really understand
what's going on.

144
00:06:19,797 --> 00:06:22,299
And we'll both be in trouble
for a while and that's it.

145
00:06:24,426 --> 00:06:28,889
We should get rid of the evidence.
Is there like a pizza oven around here?

146
00:06:28,972 --> 00:06:30,641
Or one of those junkyard crusher things,

147
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:32,976
or I could tie it to a rock
and throw it in the river.

148
00:06:41,235 --> 00:06:42,861
That works.

149
00:06:46,698 --> 00:06:48,408
Both of you, sit.

150
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:02,214
In my store...

151
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:04,967
my place of work...

152
00:07:06,552 --> 00:07:07,928
Do you have no respect for me?

153
00:07:09,138 --> 00:07:10,556
Answer me.

154
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:11,473
- Of course...
- Uh, yeah.

155
00:07:11,557 --> 00:07:12,683
Close your mouths.

156
00:07:15,644 --> 00:07:16,937
Esther told me everything.

157
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:21,900
First of all,
I am so disappointed in you, Miguel.

158
00:07:22,943 --> 00:07:25,404
Stealing? Stealing?

159
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:29,032
How could you do that?
I mean, what were you thinking?

160
00:07:29,116 --> 00:07:32,536
What, why is that something
you would even consider?

161
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:33,745
Answer me.

162
00:07:33,829 --> 00:07:35,372
- Uh, I, I...
- Close your mouth.

163
00:07:36,915 --> 00:07:37,958
And you,

164
00:07:39,418 --> 00:07:42,171
you just stood by and let Miguel do this?

165
00:07:42,254 --> 00:07:46,341
Um, you know better than that, Rafa.
You should have said something.

166
00:07:48,927 --> 00:07:52,848
I just can't believe you would
do something so stupid, Miguel.

167
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:56,685
You coulda gotten into some real trouble.

168
00:07:56,768 --> 00:07:59,938
You coulda gotten Rafa
into real trouble for no reason.

169
00:08:03,275 --> 00:08:05,152
Do you have anything to say for yourself?

170
00:08:10,365 --> 00:08:11,533
No, ma'am.

171
00:08:12,701 --> 00:08:13,702
Good.

172
00:08:14,786 --> 00:08:16,663
You sit here and think about this

173
00:08:16,747 --> 00:08:19,041
while I figure out
what I'm gonna do with you.

174
00:08:26,131 --> 00:08:27,758
That went pretty well, I thought.

175
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:30,719
Considering.

176
00:08:36,433 --> 00:08:39,645
I mean, Esther must have only seen you
take the candy bar and not me.

177
00:08:39,728 --> 00:08:40,771
I don't know.

178
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:43,190
You gotta say something.
You didn't say anything.

179
00:08:43,273 --> 00:08:44,733
Well, to be fair, neither did you.

180
00:08:44,816 --> 00:08:46,902
Yeah, 'cause I don't snitch
on my friends.

181
00:08:46,985 --> 00:08:48,904
But we both did this.

182
00:08:48,987 --> 00:08:50,989
You shoulda told her you stole something,
too, so we're both in trouble.

183
00:08:51,073 --> 00:08:52,449
That's on you.

184
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:54,993
I know. Sorry. It's my bad.

185
00:08:55,077 --> 00:08:58,288
It's, I just, I just panicked.
I'm new at crime.

186
00:08:59,373 --> 00:09:00,666
I'll tell her though.

187
00:09:00,749 --> 00:09:02,167
Miguel, kitchen, now.

188
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:06,630
Sorry, I lied. I'm never telling her.

189
00:09:14,596 --> 00:09:19,893
Miguel, I decided what you did
earned a spin of the punishment wheel.

190
00:09:19,977 --> 00:09:20,852
Like a game?

191
00:09:20,936 --> 00:09:24,815
Yeah, like a game,
where every prize is pain.

192
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:29,278
As long as you don't get
"Spreadsheet tutorial with Uncle Ryan,"

193
00:09:29,361 --> 00:09:30,988
you'll be mostly okay.
That's the worst one.

194
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:34,408
But whatever you get, I'm gonna help.

195
00:09:34,491 --> 00:09:35,701
That's okay, Rafa.

196
00:09:35,784 --> 00:09:38,120
I'm the one
who screwed up so I'll do this myself.

197
00:09:44,376 --> 00:09:45,544
Hot Stone Therapy?

198
00:09:46,628 --> 00:09:47,796
That doesn't sound that bad.

199
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:51,842
Move these rocks to that side of the yard.

200
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:54,928
Oh, now I get why it's bad.

201
00:09:55,012 --> 00:09:56,179
Uh-hmm.

202
00:09:56,263 --> 00:09:58,598
I'm gonna get my chair.
I'll be right back.

203
00:10:01,143 --> 00:10:03,562
Oh! Ah! They're hot!

204
00:10:03,645 --> 00:10:05,314
You were told they'd be hot.

205
00:10:18,702 --> 00:10:21,204
What's up, Primo? Cheese?

206
00:10:21,288 --> 00:10:22,289
No.

207
00:10:22,372 --> 00:10:24,458
- How about we take a walk?
- Why?

208
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:27,127
I have errands to run
and I can use some company.

209
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:30,255
Grab your shoes
and see if you can find my shoes.

210
00:10:30,339 --> 00:10:34,926
I swear I took them off when I got here,
but I may not have been wearing any.

211
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:36,595
You have some shoes I can borrow?

212
00:10:37,387 --> 00:10:38,430
What size do you wear?

213
00:10:38,513 --> 00:10:39,931
Uh-hmm.

214
00:10:40,015 --> 00:10:41,224
You don't know?

215
00:10:42,893 --> 00:10:45,520
First of all, thank you
for trusting me with your family security

216
00:10:45,604 --> 00:10:48,523
and tacitly acknowledging
that I am an adult with things to offer.

217
00:10:48,607 --> 00:10:52,444
As the senior account professional
currently scheduled to work today,

218
00:10:52,527 --> 00:10:55,489
you made the right decision
when it comes to your financial future.

219
00:10:55,572 --> 00:10:57,491
- This was a mistake.
- Okay. No, hold on.

220
00:10:57,574 --> 00:10:59,076
Hold on. Sit down.

221
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:01,870
Okay.
Um, why'd you bring all your coats?

222
00:11:01,953 --> 00:11:04,748
You told me to bring my money.
My money's in the coats.

223
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:07,834
Before we start,
all financial institutions

224
00:11:07,918 --> 00:11:10,545
are money grubbing pirates
that bank rob with fees and fraud.

225
00:11:10,629 --> 00:11:11,755
Got it.

226
00:11:11,838 --> 00:11:15,050
That being said,
I want an account for each coat category.

227
00:11:15,133 --> 00:11:16,551
Okay.

228
00:11:16,635 --> 00:11:18,553
Fill out this form for checking.

229
00:11:18,637 --> 00:11:20,931
Um, how much will you be depositing?

230
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:24,393
There should be $1,847
in paper cash in the right pocket

231
00:11:24,476 --> 00:11:26,269
and ten dollars in coins
in the left pocket.

232
00:11:27,979 --> 00:11:29,022
Okay.

233
00:11:32,818 --> 00:11:35,237
Something interesting over here?
Eyes on your own money.

234
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:38,740
Okay. Sorry, Janice. Lunatic.

235
00:11:41,118 --> 00:11:44,621
Okay. You should, uh,
also open a savings account,

236
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:48,208
a 529 plan for the girls
and maybe buy some MUNIs.

237
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:50,877
- MUNIs?
- Yeah, it means Municipal Bonds.

238
00:11:50,961 --> 00:11:54,131
No lingo.
Anything with bank lingo I'm not doing.

239
00:11:54,214 --> 00:11:56,883
Don't try to swindle me
with your half words.

240
00:11:56,967 --> 00:11:59,511
Okay. Why don't you just be
real mad over there

241
00:11:59,594 --> 00:12:01,471
and let me just figure all this out?

242
00:12:04,683 --> 00:12:08,728
I'm taking this as collateral.
And keep Janice away from my coats.

243
00:12:08,812 --> 00:12:10,397
- She's got rat eyes.
- Okay.

244
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:14,568
Again, sorry, Janice.
I, I think it's your glasses.

245
00:12:14,651 --> 00:12:16,236
But you, you should get LASIK.

246
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:22,242
Do you know
how the punishment wheel was invented?

247
00:12:23,285 --> 00:12:26,037
Years ago, Rollie threw firecrackers
at what turned out

248
00:12:26,121 --> 00:12:29,374
to be a first communion or something.

249
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:31,793
So Father Montoya tried to punish him

250
00:12:31,877 --> 00:12:33,837
by making him weed
the garden of the church

251
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,006
and, of course, Rollie got bored and he...

252
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:40,552
he started smashing Jesuses and cactuses.

253
00:12:40,635 --> 00:12:41,761
So you know what I said?

254
00:12:41,845 --> 00:12:45,432
I said I'm gonna do what the church can't,
boom, punishment wheel.

255
00:12:49,352 --> 00:12:50,270
Done.

256
00:12:50,353 --> 00:12:51,480
Good job.

257
00:12:54,024 --> 00:12:57,360
You know what?
Now that I'm looking at it,

258
00:12:57,444 --> 00:13:00,030
I actually think these rocks
should be moved to the backyard.

259
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:01,364
But you just said...

260
00:13:01,448 --> 00:13:02,491
Forget what I said before.

261
00:13:03,575 --> 00:13:04,701
Get to work.

262
00:13:07,162 --> 00:13:08,455
Here we go, first stop.

263
00:13:09,456 --> 00:13:10,415
Whose house is this?

264
00:13:10,499 --> 00:13:11,666
I don't know.

265
00:13:12,709 --> 00:13:15,212
But I saw this plant on my walk
every day and it needed to be cared for,

266
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:17,214
so I started watering it.

267
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:19,549
Cool. Are we done? Can we go home now?

268
00:13:21,426 --> 00:13:24,679
I keep this here
so the sprinklers fill it at night.

269
00:13:36,066 --> 00:13:38,818
Oh, okay. I get it.

270
00:13:38,902 --> 00:13:41,029
This is a metaphor.
That's what you're doing?

271
00:13:42,572 --> 00:13:45,325
So, am I the plant?
Am I the water?

272
00:13:47,369 --> 00:13:48,662
Am I the can?

273
00:13:48,745 --> 00:13:50,080
Just an errand.

274
00:13:51,456 --> 00:13:53,375
Check the trash can,
see if there's any food.

275
00:13:58,129 --> 00:14:00,757
There's half a bag of moldy bread.

276
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,634
Perfect. Grab it.

277
00:14:02,717 --> 00:14:03,927
You grab it.

278
00:14:09,474 --> 00:14:13,395
Every time I hang out with this guy,
you gotta dig through a trash can.

279
00:14:20,193 --> 00:14:21,319
Almost done.

280
00:14:21,403 --> 00:14:24,864
Uh, just sign this
for the 529 college fund, and we're good.

281
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:29,703
Feels weird knowing there's no money
in all those coats.

282
00:14:29,786 --> 00:14:32,706
And I'd say it's weird
that there was money in any of them ever.

283
00:14:32,789 --> 00:14:34,916
All right. You're all set.

284
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,960
Welcome to adulthood,
my 40-year-old brother.

285
00:14:38,336 --> 00:14:39,879
Let me see my money one more time.

286
00:14:39,963 --> 00:14:43,675
Okay. There you go.

287
00:14:43,758 --> 00:14:47,721
No. The actual money I gave you.
The actual cash. Where is it?

288
00:14:47,804 --> 00:14:50,849
It's in here, you weirdo.
It's in the bank.

289
00:14:50,932 --> 00:14:52,392
I don't like this.

290
00:14:52,475 --> 00:14:54,978
I like holding it.
I like physically knowing where it is.

291
00:14:55,061 --> 00:14:56,771
It's... Jesus, man.

292
00:14:56,855 --> 00:14:59,524
The vault is in the back.
That's where they keep the cash.

293
00:14:59,608 --> 00:15:00,942
Vaults get robbed.

294
00:15:01,026 --> 00:15:02,569
Yeah. And so do closets.

295
00:15:02,652 --> 00:15:05,697
Yeah. And you got robbed earlier today
by your nine-year-old daughter.

296
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:10,869
So, anytime I want, I can go to the ATM
and get cash out to pay my crew, right?

297
00:15:10,952 --> 00:15:13,747
Yes. As long as you don't need
more than $800 per day.

298
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:15,373
That's the ATM limit.

299
00:15:15,457 --> 00:15:18,668
I definitely need more than that.
Lots of my guys gotta get paid in cash.

300
00:15:18,752 --> 00:15:21,713
I can't be coming here five days in a row
in order to get enough out to pay them.

301
00:15:21,796 --> 00:15:24,591
Okay. No problem.
We'll set you up with direct deposit.

302
00:15:24,674 --> 00:15:26,635
This is exactly what I was afraid of.

303
00:15:26,718 --> 00:15:28,845
I don't know
how I let you talk me into this.

304
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:32,182
I didn't talk you into anything.
Stop acting like I'm trying to hustle you.

305
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:33,558
No.

306
00:15:33,642 --> 00:15:35,810
Close all these accounts
and give me my money back.

307
00:15:35,894 --> 00:15:38,355
Put the money back
in those coats, exactly how it was,

308
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:41,066
including the $10 in coins
that I had in the left pocket.

309
00:15:43,818 --> 00:15:45,403
I'll be in the parking lot.

310
00:15:45,487 --> 00:15:47,947
The rule is "one per customer."

311
00:15:48,031 --> 00:15:51,451
And you're not even a customer!

312
00:15:52,827 --> 00:15:55,372
What, Janice? What?

313
00:15:57,415 --> 00:15:58,500
Rat eyes.

314
00:16:00,293 --> 00:16:03,296
Now, Mike, he needed some discipline.

315
00:16:04,506 --> 00:16:09,761
He sold my TV to get some extra money
to buy what he swore were dinosaur eggs.

316
00:16:09,844 --> 00:16:12,347
This was right after  Jurassic World
came out.

317
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:15,558
Truth be told, I, I kind of thought
they were dinosaur eggs, too.

318
00:16:15,642 --> 00:16:17,602
Turns out, they were just smooth rocks.

319
00:16:18,853 --> 00:16:21,314
So, that's how
this particular punishment was born.

320
00:16:22,482 --> 00:16:25,443
There.

321
00:16:25,527 --> 00:16:28,071
Done. Again.

322
00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:32,992
You know what? I hate it.

323
00:16:33,076 --> 00:16:37,414
I think I was right the first time.
Move these back to the front yard.

324
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:40,083
No. Nah. I'm not doing it.

325
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:41,960
- I'm done.
- Excuse me?

326
00:16:42,043 --> 00:16:43,795
I've been moving these rocks all day.

327
00:16:43,878 --> 00:16:47,382
Yeah.
Because that's your punishment.

328
00:16:47,465 --> 00:16:49,050
Because you stole something

329
00:16:49,134 --> 00:16:51,386
and we don't do that
in this house, Miguel.

330
00:16:53,847 --> 00:16:58,184
Now, pick up these rocks
and move them back to the front yard.

331
00:17:13,074 --> 00:17:14,200
Thank you.

332
00:17:14,284 --> 00:17:16,619
I'll be in the house.
Come see me when you're done.

333
00:17:24,919 --> 00:17:26,629
Do you know who owns these chickens?

334
00:17:26,713 --> 00:17:28,298
No.

335
00:17:28,381 --> 00:17:31,301
It's a good feeling,
isn't it, feeding them?

336
00:17:31,384 --> 00:17:33,887
You and this chicken are connected now.

337
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:36,514
I don't wanna be connected to a chicken.

338
00:17:36,598 --> 00:17:38,767
What's the matter, Primo?

339
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:41,936
Your hands are empty,
but you seem to be carrying a lot.

340
00:17:43,855 --> 00:17:45,690
It just sucks that Miguel's in trouble.

341
00:17:46,775 --> 00:17:48,610
- That's his thing, though, right?
- Yeah.

342
00:17:48,693 --> 00:17:50,570
Or... no.

343
00:17:52,447 --> 00:17:54,532
I don't know.

344
00:17:54,616 --> 00:17:56,743
Technically, I was with him.

345
00:17:56,826 --> 00:17:58,077
Hmm.

346
00:17:59,287 --> 00:18:02,540
Well, don't be so hard on yourself.
There's nothing you can do about it now.

347
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:04,959
Bread?

348
00:18:05,043 --> 00:18:06,920
No. It's moldy.

349
00:18:08,546 --> 00:18:10,465
Mold is just organic penicillin.

350
00:18:10,548 --> 00:18:13,510
Uncle Mondo, mold and penicillin
are not the same thing.

351
00:18:13,593 --> 00:18:16,805
Well, I've eaten a lot of mold
and I've never had an infection.

352
00:18:16,888 --> 00:18:17,972
You absolutely have.

353
00:18:18,056 --> 00:18:19,849
Hmm.

354
00:18:19,933 --> 00:18:24,646
You know what? I'm done.
I just wanna go home, play video games.

355
00:18:24,729 --> 00:18:25,897
Okay.

356
00:18:30,443 --> 00:18:32,278
Okay. I get it.

357
00:18:32,362 --> 00:18:35,406
You want me to go home
and play video games

358
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:38,076
'cause you know
I usually play video games with Miguel.

359
00:18:39,327 --> 00:18:41,204
I just figured out your whole plan, man.

360
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:42,705
- My plan?
- Yeah.

361
00:18:42,789 --> 00:18:45,083
For you to do the thing
you said you wanted to do?

362
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:47,585
Oh. And you'd love that, wouldn't you?

363
00:18:47,669 --> 00:18:49,754
Of course, I'd love it if you were happy.

364
00:18:49,838 --> 00:18:52,966
You're sick, you know that?
I should've seen this coming.

365
00:18:53,049 --> 00:18:58,263
Typical Uncle Mondo just trying to make
sure everyone's happy and full of love.

366
00:18:58,346 --> 00:18:59,722
You know what?

367
00:18:59,806 --> 00:19:04,018
It is not my fault that Miguel
stole that candy bar from the store, okay?

368
00:19:04,102 --> 00:19:07,981
I didn't make him do it.
I mean, I'm not perfect.

369
00:19:08,064 --> 00:19:11,401
I've done things that are wrong.
Yeah. And some of those things

370
00:19:11,484 --> 00:19:14,279
were immediately before the things
that he did.

371
00:19:14,362 --> 00:19:17,240
But maybe I wanna feel bad
about those things.

372
00:19:17,323 --> 00:19:19,534
Maybe that's my "journey."

373
00:19:21,828 --> 00:19:25,665
Get away from me, chicken!
I'm not your friend!

374
00:19:25,748 --> 00:19:27,125
No! No!

375
00:19:39,596 --> 00:19:41,931
- I know what you're gonna say.
- Do you have any Fritos?

376
00:19:42,015 --> 00:19:45,018
Oh. I guess I didn't know
what you were gonna say.

377
00:19:45,101 --> 00:19:46,144
It's all right.

378
00:19:46,227 --> 00:19:48,229
I know you're going
through something heavy,

379
00:19:48,313 --> 00:19:49,689
but also, I want some Fritos.

380
00:19:51,816 --> 00:19:53,776
I did something crappy to Miguel.

381
00:19:56,029 --> 00:19:58,281
I screwed up and you figured it out.

382
00:20:00,742 --> 00:20:01,951
How'd you know?

383
00:20:02,035 --> 00:20:04,621
I didn't know.
But it was pretty obvious

384
00:20:04,704 --> 00:20:07,916
you had 500 pounds of pain
sitting on your chest.

385
00:20:07,999 --> 00:20:12,170
All I did was show you a few acts
of caring and love, and attention,

386
00:20:12,253 --> 00:20:15,298
and figured that would help you
confront whatever was causing you pain.

387
00:20:16,424 --> 00:20:18,426
So, how do I fix it?

388
00:20:18,509 --> 00:20:21,596
Well, the longer you take to apologize,
the harder it gets,

389
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:26,476
so let's get off this wall, head home,
make a quick stop for Fritos and then...

390
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:27,644
I don't have any money.

391
00:20:27,727 --> 00:20:30,355
Let's get off this wall,
head home, and you can make it right.

392
00:20:35,902 --> 00:20:38,112
I also feel bad
about yelling at that chicken.

393
00:20:39,364 --> 00:20:42,533
What took you so long?
I ate like half those lollipops.

394
00:20:42,617 --> 00:20:46,120
Janice had to refill the jar.
Thanks, Janice.

395
00:20:48,081 --> 00:20:49,207
We got to know each other.

396
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:52,293
Turns out she's a lovely person
and she doesn't care for you at all.

397
00:20:52,377 --> 00:20:55,129
Yeah. Well,
all the money's back in the coats.

398
00:20:55,213 --> 00:20:57,757
You can take them home and reestablish
the Burlington Cash Factory,

399
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,050
if that's what you want.

400
00:20:59,133 --> 00:21:00,718
- It is.
- Nope. Wait.

401
00:21:02,095 --> 00:21:05,098
I get that your job
is to run your business,

402
00:21:05,181 --> 00:21:06,891
and pay your workers on time.

403
00:21:06,975 --> 00:21:10,979
But my job is to keep
people's money safe, and I'm good at it.

404
00:21:11,062 --> 00:21:12,605
I know what I'm doing here, Jay.

405
00:21:14,399 --> 00:21:17,068
Fine. Maybe there's a compromise.

406
00:21:17,151 --> 00:21:19,445
There is. And I already found it.

407
00:21:20,822 --> 00:21:22,615
I swear to God, Janice.

408
00:21:26,494 --> 00:21:29,998
Safety deposit box.
You can come in during bank hours

409
00:21:30,081 --> 00:21:32,083
and take out as much as you want,
no limit.

410
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:36,421
It's actual regular cash.
And only you have access, so it's safe.

411
00:21:36,504 --> 00:21:39,298
But I did leave
the money in the girls' college fund.

412
00:21:40,383 --> 00:21:41,467
That work for you?

413
00:21:46,264 --> 00:21:47,432
You did good.

414
00:21:51,269 --> 00:21:54,522
One question, what if,
and I know this is highly unlikely...

415
00:21:54,605 --> 00:21:56,649
Ocean's Eleven  cannot happen here.

416
00:21:56,733 --> 00:21:58,693
Okay. But what if...

417
00:21:58,776 --> 00:22:00,153
Neither can  The Town.

418
00:22:00,236 --> 00:22:02,405
Good. But...

419
00:22:02,488 --> 00:22:04,824
Jay, no movie-style bank heists
is going to happen

420
00:22:04,907 --> 00:22:06,909
in this regional San Antonio bank branch.

421
00:22:10,204 --> 00:22:13,166
I'm done.

422
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:19,714
And I'm sorry for everything.

423
00:22:21,758 --> 00:22:26,554
And I just wanted to say
thank you for all the meals,

424
00:22:26,637 --> 00:22:29,098
and for letting me sleepover
all those times.

425
00:22:30,224 --> 00:22:32,351
Why are you talking
like you're never gonna see me again?

426
00:22:32,435 --> 00:22:34,937
I don't know, 'cause I'm not, right?

427
00:22:35,021 --> 00:22:37,023
It's what you said.
Since I stole that thing.

428
00:22:37,106 --> 00:22:38,274
That's what you said.

429
00:22:45,948 --> 00:22:50,328
Miguel, when I said,
"We don't do that in this house,"

430
00:22:50,411 --> 00:22:51,996
you're included in the "we."

431
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:55,541
Do you remember when you and I first met?

432
00:22:57,085 --> 00:22:59,253
You and Rafa were in the sixth grade.

433
00:22:59,337 --> 00:23:03,341
I never had the mom of the kid
I was bullying come to my house before.

434
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:05,176
I thought you were gonna be so mad at me.

435
00:23:05,259 --> 00:23:06,302
I was.

436
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:10,598
But then you said
all those nice things about me

437
00:23:10,681 --> 00:23:14,227
to my grandparents,
and, and invited me over for, for dinner.

438
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:15,728
That's right.

439
00:23:15,812 --> 00:23:19,732
That invitation is still open, Miguel.
Always will be.

440
00:23:21,192 --> 00:23:23,611
I am furious at you

441
00:23:23,694 --> 00:23:25,822
and that's why you spun
the punishment wheel.

442
00:23:27,073 --> 00:23:28,950
But that doesn't change the other things.

443
00:23:30,785 --> 00:23:32,286
Do you understand what I'm saying?

444
00:23:33,871 --> 00:23:36,457
Yeah. I think so.

445
00:23:36,541 --> 00:23:37,500
Good.

446
00:23:38,584 --> 00:23:40,753
Don't steal again.

447
00:23:40,837 --> 00:23:42,255
Yes, ma'am.

448
00:23:54,016 --> 00:23:55,476
That was my water.

449
00:23:57,061 --> 00:23:58,104
Oh, my God.

450
00:24:05,862 --> 00:24:06,988
Hey.

451
00:24:08,406 --> 00:24:10,241
Uh, are you done moving those rocks?

452
00:24:10,324 --> 00:24:14,829
Yeah. Yeah. I was, uh,
I was just talking to your mom.

453
00:24:16,372 --> 00:24:17,832
She's cool.

454
00:24:17,915 --> 00:24:18,833
Yeah.

455
00:24:20,001 --> 00:24:23,796
Hey. So, I'm sorry about earlier.

456
00:24:25,339 --> 00:24:26,507
I didn't have your back.

457
00:24:28,551 --> 00:24:30,845
Yeah, that sucked.

458
00:24:32,138 --> 00:24:33,264
But I get it.

459
00:24:35,183 --> 00:24:37,643
I'm, I'm sorry
that I was messing with you.

460
00:24:37,727 --> 00:24:40,062
No. No, man. Don't worry about it.

461
00:24:41,814 --> 00:24:44,108
Me, I'm, I'm sorry
that I was late to hang out earlier.

462
00:24:44,192 --> 00:24:48,696
Yeah, yeah. No.
The college thing is important.

463
00:24:50,198 --> 00:24:53,576
Damn, we got a lot of stuff
to apologize for today.

464
00:24:53,659 --> 00:24:55,077
Yeah.

465
00:24:55,786 --> 00:25:00,458
Hey. So, are you doing anything now?
You wanna hang out?

466
00:25:03,836 --> 00:25:05,004
What do you wanna do?

467
00:25:13,971 --> 00:25:14,972
Yes.

468
00:25:18,059 --> 00:25:20,269
You're right.
The extra board makes it more secure.

469
00:25:20,353 --> 00:25:22,563
Yeah. We're definitely gonna crash
