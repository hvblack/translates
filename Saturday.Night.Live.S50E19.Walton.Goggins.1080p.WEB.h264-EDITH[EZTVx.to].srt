MESSAGE

2
00:00:09,275 --> 00:00:13,499
Well,
tomorrow is Mother's Day,

3
00:00:13,499 --> 00:00:18,429
and in the SNL tradition,
we'd like to take this time
to celebrate our moms.

4
00:00:18,429 --> 00:00:21,035
The women who made us, cared
for us

5
00:00:21,035 --> 00:00:25,724
and bit their tongues
when we told them we wanted
to go into show business.

6
00:00:25,724 --> 00:00:27,414
They've done so much for us.

7
00:00:27,414 --> 00:00:30,739
So moms, this is for you.

8
00:00:31,745 --> 00:00:34,780
You cut the crust.
Off my. Bread.

9
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:36,952
And tucked me into bed.

10
00:00:36,952 --> 00:00:41,583
But how often have we said
we love you, mom?

11
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:44,157
I can always count on mom.

12
00:00:44,157 --> 00:00:46,614
You took me to the prom.

13
00:00:46,614 --> 00:00:48,739
You bought me my first bong.

14
00:00:48,739 --> 00:00:51,704
Just kidding. Mommy.

15
00:00:51,704 --> 00:00:54,825
Moms, you never bore us.

16
00:00:54,825 --> 00:00:57,465
You were always there for us.

17
00:00:57,465 --> 00:01:01,892
Now it's
time to sing the chorus.

18
00:01:01,892 --> 00:01:03,563
Or not.

19
00:01:04,331 --> 00:01:06,504
Hello?
It's me again.

20
00:01:06,504 --> 00:01:09,435
Invading
all aspects of your life.

21
00:01:09,606 --> 00:01:13,322
All right,
go on.

22
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:15,811
I got the right idea.
Just move it
along.

23
00:01:15,811 --> 00:01:17,728
Bye bye, moms.

24
00:01:17,728 --> 00:01:19,883
Don't worry.
Those aren't even the real moms.

25
00:01:19,883 --> 00:01:21,742
Those are. actors
Can you believe that?

26
00:01:21,742 --> 00:01:24,312
SNL wouldnt
spring for the flights.

27
00:01:24,312 --> 00:01:26,582
What the hell am I doing here?

28
00:01:26,582 --> 00:01:28,765
There's a new pope from Chicago.

29
00:01:28,765 --> 00:01:31,748
Why are we doing
da pope? Right?

30
00:01:31,748 --> 00:01:35,293
Like da bears, but da prayers.
You know what the

31
00:01:35,293 --> 00:01:37,057
first thought.
Whatever.

32
00:01:37,057 --> 00:01:40,166
Instead, you get me.
Is it that exciting?

33
00:01:40,166 --> 00:01:43,642
Oh, it's so exciting.
We have an American Pope
Chicago style.

34
00:01:43,642 --> 00:01:46,529
No ketchup
but we like Pope Leo.

35
00:01:46,529 --> 00:01:48,389
We hope he does what we want.

36
00:01:48,389 --> 00:01:50,913
That's what you want the Pope
to do what you want right now.

37
00:01:50,913 --> 00:01:55,053
Otherwise, I'll have to send
J.D. back to do his thing.

38
00:01:54,949 --> 00:01:57,836
Last time
J.D. met the Pope.

39
00:01:57,943 --> 00:02:01,351
He's got the Midas touch.
But for bad things,

40
00:02:01,351 --> 00:02:03,490
he meets the Pope dead,

41
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:06,262
goes to India War

42
00:02:06,262 --> 00:02:08,857
and joins my campaign.
Trump wins.

43
00:02:08,857 --> 00:02:11,699
Incredible
Bad things happen in threes.

44
00:02:11,699 --> 00:02:14,684
But we like the way
they elect Mr. Pope.

45
00:02:14,684 --> 00:02:15,699
We like the smoke.

46
00:02:15,699 --> 00:02:18,517
It's wonderful
what they're doing with smoke

47
00:02:18,517 --> 00:02:21,690
and phallic hats
and the popemobile.

48
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:22,555
We like that as well.

49
00:02:22,555 --> 00:02:24,515
One of my favorite mobiles.

50
00:02:24,515 --> 00:02:27,423
After Weiner and Bat.

51
00:02:27,423 --> 00:02:29,632
But we love Catholic.

52
00:02:29,632 --> 00:02:32,241
It's one of these stronger
Christian organizations,

53
00:02:32,241 --> 00:02:34,468
along with Salvation Army.

54
00:02:34,468 --> 00:02:36,480
And I want to say Chick-Fil-A.

55
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,730
And we love Catholic Mass.

56
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:41,311
The only thing I don't like
is that holy water.

57
00:02:41,311 --> 00:02:44,671
Why does that stuff burn so bad
when it hits your skin?

58
00:02:44,671 --> 00:02:45,756
What's in this?

59
00:02:45,756 --> 00:02:48,449
We gotta figure that out.
We'll be looking into that.

60
00:02:48,449 --> 00:02:50,922
What else was going on?

61
00:02:50,922 --> 00:02:54,730
The debt is piling up,
and we've got no trade deals.

62
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:57,079
Well, you know what?
We've got one with the UK,

63
00:02:57,079 --> 00:02:59,558
but they don't have anything
we want. Right.

64
00:02:59,558 --> 00:03:03,685
Sir, how many Cadbury fruit
and nut bars?

65
00:03:03,685 --> 00:03:04,904
Zero.

66
00:03:04,904 --> 00:03:07,723
So not going to be doing trade
more.

67
00:03:07,723 --> 00:03:10,448
Question.
Can a country
go out of business.

68
00:03:10,448 --> 00:03:12,274
We're going to find out.

69
00:03:12,274 --> 00:03:16,601
It's that news
I just appointed one of
the loudest people
I know

70
00:03:16,601 --> 00:03:20,232
to be the U.S.
attorney in D.C., Jeanine Pirro.

71
00:03:20,232 --> 00:03:22,703
Come on out, Jeanine.
Come on

72
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:34,463
Honor

73
00:03:34,463 --> 00:03:39,386
Look at this.
This is Jeanine has brought her
files, and she's ready to work.

74
00:03:39,386 --> 00:03:44,294
Oh, no.
This is too cozy for merlosy

75
00:03:44,294 --> 00:03:47,905
See, she always comes prepared,
and that rhymed, I like that.

76
00:03:47,905 --> 00:03:49,446
Thank you.

77
00:03:50,998 --> 00:03:54,110
Sweet justice.

78
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:58,489
Oh, Jeanine will be the newest
addition to my incredible team
in my administration.

79
00:03:58,489 --> 00:04:01,158
And what a team, Mr. President.

80
00:04:01,158 --> 00:04:03,932
I'm so proud to be part
of this group

81
00:04:03,932 --> 00:04:07,132
full of Russian assets,
booze hounds

82
00:04:07,132 --> 00:04:11,469
and people famous for the little
baby animals they've killed.

83
00:04:11,469 --> 00:04:13,395
Proud to you.

84
00:04:13,395 --> 00:04:18,240
I personally, Big Jeanine,
to be the U.S.
attorney in Washington, D.C..
Isn't that right?

85
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:20,459
That's right. The district,

86
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:23,920
or as the locals
call it, Chocolate City.

87
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:28,750
So all you soul
sisters and brothers
put the word out on the street.

88
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:32,376
There's a bad new mama
Jamal laying down the law.

89
00:04:32,376 --> 00:04:37,749
Gotten down and funky town
looking fine
and sipping wine.

90
00:04:40,749 --> 00:04:45,514
Now I'm so glad we can
Talk like this again,
Mr.. President.

91
00:04:45,514 --> 00:04:46,956
Oh, we love Jeanine.

92
00:04:46,956 --> 00:04:48,461
She's a great legal mind,

93
00:04:48,461 --> 00:04:52,181
and she has the most important quality.
I look for in a lawyer.

94
00:04:52,181 --> 00:04:53,771
She's on TV.

95
00:04:53,771 --> 00:04:56,957
She's on the five,
which is a show on Fox.

96
00:04:56,957 --> 00:04:59,581
And I like The View. I'm a.

97
00:04:59,581 --> 00:05:01,561
Here are indeed the Whoopie

98
00:05:01,561 --> 00:05:04,731
You're very Whoopie, but
you're also very, very tough.

99
00:05:04,731 --> 00:05:07,097
Yes, especially on immigration.

100
00:05:07,097 --> 00:05:10,596
I don't have any reservations
about sending things back.

101
00:05:10,596 --> 00:05:15,797
My friends know I've sent back
every salad I've ever ordered
at a restaurant.

102
00:05:15,797 --> 00:05:17,651
One.
No, I've never eaten one.

103
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:22,495
Wow.
I know what
hiring people from Fox News,
they all do an incredible job.

104
00:05:22,495 --> 00:05:24,992
Just look at Pete Hegseth
There's not one mistake.

105
00:05:24,992 --> 00:05:27,033
Oh, I. Love Pete Hegseth.

106
00:05:27,033 --> 00:05:29,019
He's my own drinking buddy.

107
00:05:29,019 --> 00:05:31,261
Surprise!

108
00:05:34,357 --> 00:05:36,269
What?

109
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:38,886
Here

110
00:05:40,196 --> 00:05:43,896
Yes. But, you know, I asked Pete
to give us a little
rundown

111
00:05:43,896 --> 00:05:46,039
on one of our F-18
fighter planes.

112
00:05:46,039 --> 00:05:49,484
Oh, is it bombing the houties?

113
00:05:49,484 --> 00:05:54,631
Close.
It fell off the aircraft carrier
into the ocean.

114
00:05:55,397 --> 00:05:57,462
What? Again?

115
00:05:57,462 --> 00:05:59,991
Hey, Pete.
You're not drinking again,
are you?

116
00:05:59,991 --> 00:06:01,970
No.
Absolutely not, sir.

117
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:04,949
I promised I would never have
a bottle touch my lips,

118
00:06:04,949 --> 00:06:08,109
but I do have some news to share
before I do.

119
00:06:08,109 --> 00:06:09,953
Janine,
you want to take a swig of this?

120
00:06:09,953 --> 00:06:11,747
Oh, yeah. Oh, there.

121
00:06:11,747 --> 00:06:13,952
You know I do. Oh, yeah.

122
00:06:14,046 --> 00:06:18,579
Anyway,
I accidentally added Kim Jong un
to the group chat.

123
00:06:20,352 --> 00:06:22,509
What?

124
00:06:26,822 --> 00:06:31,157
Oh, yeah.
Yeah. That's the.
That's the stuff,

125
00:06:31,157 --> 00:06:33,750
folks.They're not the A-Team.
They're the AA-Team. Right?

126
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:36,310
Anyway, in conclusion,
happy Mother's Day.

127
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:40,648
AND LIVE
FROM NEW YORK, IT'S SATURDAY
NIGHT!

128
00:09:00,107 --> 00:09:05,400
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN -- WALTON
GOGGINS!

129
00:09:18,628 --> 00:09:21,280
Thank you.
Thank you.

130
00:09:25,455 --> 00:09:28,902
Thank you, thank you,
thank you very, very, very much.

131
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:31,958
I am so excited to be here.

132
00:09:31,958 --> 00:09:36,832
Now, most of you
probably know me from the show
White Lotus.

133
00:09:38,334 --> 00:09:42,197
No spoilers, but I die

134
00:09:42,197 --> 00:09:45,291
my character in White Lotus
is pretty brooding,

135
00:09:45,291 --> 00:09:48,385
which the internet
seemed to find attractive.

136
00:09:48,385 --> 00:09:50,222
Some of my friends
have even asked me

137
00:09:50,222 --> 00:09:55,074
What's it like
to become a sex symbol?
At 53 years old?

138
00:09:55,074 --> 00:09:57,938
And you know what?
If I'm being honest,

139
00:09:57,938 --> 00:10:01,733
it feels fantastic.

140
00:10:02,851 --> 00:10:07,610
At least it did
until I googled myself
and read some of the headlines.

141
00:10:07,711 --> 00:10:09,239
Take a look.

142
00:10:09,239 --> 00:10:12,129
Are we all horny?

143
00:10:14,075 --> 00:10:18,023
Are we all horny
for Walton
Goggins receding hairline?

144
00:10:18,023 --> 00:10:21,802
I've had the same hairline
since I was seven.

145
00:10:21,802 --> 00:10:25,563
It's not receding.
It's holding its ground.

146
00:10:25,563 --> 00:10:27,341
How about this one?

147
00:10:27,341 --> 00:10:32,300
His hair is greasy,
his eyes are bulging.

148
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:34,438
I think I'm in love.

149
00:10:34,438 --> 00:10:37,068
Wow. Beautiful journalism.

150
00:10:37,068 --> 00:10:39,544
How about this one?
It's my favorite.

151
00:10:39,544 --> 00:10:46,181
Hollywood's newest
heartthrob is a greasy,
depressing little man

152
00:10:46,181 --> 00:10:48,302
who no one saw coming.

153
00:10:48,302 --> 00:10:50,127
Thank you.

154
00:10:50,127 --> 00:10:53,473
For some reason,
the part of that headline
that offends me the most

155
00:10:53,473 --> 00:10:57,337
is the word whom
It just sounds pretentious.

156
00:10:57,337 --> 00:11:00,417
But you know
what isn't pretentious?

157
00:11:00,417 --> 00:11:03,031
My upbringing.

158
00:11:03,031 --> 00:11:05,526
I was raised in Atlanta,
Georgia, by my mother,

159
00:11:05,526 --> 00:11:09,060
with the help of her three
sisters and my grandmother.

160
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:13,809
And my mama
is the most important person
in my life.

161
00:11:17,151 --> 00:11:19,753
Going, growing, going up.

162
00:11:19,753 --> 00:11:22,255
Whenever my mama, she couldn't
afford a babysitter,

163
00:11:22,255 --> 00:11:24,816
she would take me with her
to honky tonks.

164
00:11:24,816 --> 00:11:28,435
My mother taught me how to clog,
told me how to 2-step

165
00:11:28,435 --> 00:11:33,275
And luckily enough for
me, my mama's here tonight.

166
00:11:40,317 --> 00:11:43,602
We've got, we've.
We've come a really long way,
haven't we, mom?

167
00:11:43,602 --> 00:11:45,135
Absolutely.

168
00:11:45,135 --> 00:11:48,110
And since his Mother's Day
tomorrow.

169
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:51,758
Mama, would you dance with me?

170
00:12:07,428 --> 00:12:09,152
You know what?
Yeah. Hold on.

171
00:12:09,152 --> 00:12:11,260
Let's kick
this up a notch,

172
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:14,142
fellas. If you don't mind.

173
00:12:21,069 --> 00:12:24,663
Oh, we got a great show for you
tonight.

174
00:12:24,663 --> 00:12:27,223
Arcade fire here.

175
00:12:27,223 --> 00:12:29,233
Happy Mother|s Day.

176
00:12:29,233 --> 00:12:32,585
Stick around.
We|ll be right back

177
00:12:48,802 --> 00:12:51,104
And so we are resolved.

178
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:55,008
The First Amendment to
our Constitution is as follows.

179
00:12:55,008 --> 00:12:57,410
Congress
shall make no law respecting

180
00:12:57,410 --> 00:12:59,012
an establishment of religion,

181
00:12:59,012 --> 00:13:00,647
of abridging
the freedom of speech,

182
00:13:00,647 --> 00:13:01,648
or of the press,

183
00:13:01,715 --> 00:13:04,684
or of the right of the people
peaceably to assemble,

184
00:13:04,684 --> 00:13:08,588
and to petition the government
for a redress of grievances.

185
00:13:08,588 --> 00:13:09,889
Well done, gentlemen.

186
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:13,793
The First Amendment,

187
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:14,828
All right.

188
00:13:14,828 --> 00:13:15,395
All right.

189
00:13:15,862 --> 00:13:18,164
Now, what shall we discuss next?
What is the second

190
00:13:18,164 --> 00:13:25,071
most important
principle of our nation? Gun.

191
00:13:25,071 --> 00:13:31,111
Excuse me. Gun.

192
00:13:31,111 --> 00:13:33,480
I don't hate that.

193
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:36,149
Well, I do. It's ridiculous.

194
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:37,684
So, what is your name?

195
00:13:37,684 --> 00:13:40,620
Matt.

196
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:42,088
Matt. What?

197
00:13:42,088 --> 00:13:42,389
That.

198
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:45,392
Don't you worry about it.

199
00:13:45,392 --> 00:13:48,194
Well, Matt,
what will posterity say of us

200
00:13:48,194 --> 00:13:51,364
if the second rate
we enshrined in this document

201
00:13:51,364 --> 00:13:57,170
is simply
guns that we don't play?

202
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:57,570
Damn,

203
00:13:57,937 --> 00:14:00,573
that's
actually kind of sick. Yes.

204
00:14:00,573 --> 00:14:02,876
No, no, no.
The idea is ludicrous.

205
00:14:02,876 --> 00:14:04,444
Wait, now hold on.

206
00:14:04,444 --> 00:14:08,314
I mean, we did just make a law
that said anyone can say

207
00:14:08,314 --> 00:14:11,584
whatever crazy stuff
they want, right?

208
00:14:11,584 --> 00:14:16,089
Maybe this gun thing
would kind of balance that out.

209
00:14:16,089 --> 00:14:18,358
Bingo.

210
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:19,092
Okay. Yes.

211
00:14:19,092 --> 00:14:20,860
But by the same token, wouldn't

212
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:24,831
having a gun embolden people
to say crazy stuff as well?

213
00:14:24,831 --> 00:14:27,934
Bro. What?

214
00:14:27,934 --> 00:14:28,835
Yeah. Yeah.

215
00:14:28,835 --> 00:14:31,071
What makes that makes sense?

216
00:14:31,071 --> 00:14:34,240
Gentlemen, we cannot just have
an amendment that says guns.

217
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,276
But what about guns?

218
00:14:36,276 --> 00:14:39,179
Having them.

219
00:14:39,179 --> 00:14:40,080
That smart?

220
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,081
Like, who is this guy?

221
00:14:41,081 --> 00:14:43,283
Why isn't he running this?

222
00:14:43,283 --> 00:14:46,553
Matt, I am open to discussing
guns for a later amendment,

223
00:14:46,553 --> 00:14:50,557
but I must insist we move on
to a more pressing concern.

224
00:14:50,557 --> 00:14:54,994
You are screaming. So angry.

225
00:14:54,994 --> 00:14:59,165
So, where are you from exactly?

226
00:14:59,165 --> 00:15:04,037
America?

227
00:15:04,037 --> 00:15:05,839
Yes, but where in America?

228
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:08,208
Which state are you?

229
00:15:08,208 --> 00:15:10,443
A united one

230
00:15:10,443 --> 00:15:12,445
Oh, wow. Well said. So.

231
00:15:12,445 --> 00:15:13,947
Can this guy, like,
be on our money?

232
00:15:13,947 --> 00:15:16,383
Who is this guy?

233
00:15:16,383 --> 00:15:18,485
Have guns. Really, gentlemen?

234
00:15:18,485 --> 00:15:20,587
That's what we want
the Second Amendment to be.

235
00:15:20,587 --> 00:15:21,488
Have guns.

236
00:15:21,488 --> 00:15:22,756
That sounds idiotic.

237
00:15:22,756 --> 00:15:26,259
Just chill. Not have guns.

238
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:28,895
Bear Arms

239
00:15:28,895 --> 00:15:31,097
Oh, that is so good.

240
00:15:31,097 --> 00:15:35,435
Yeah, that sounds smart as hell.

241
00:15:35,435 --> 00:15:36,903
Yeah. Okay. I'm freaking sold.

242
00:15:36,903 --> 00:15:41,908
I'm writing an amendment
to the right to bear arms.

243
00:15:41,908 --> 00:15:42,942
I just got chills.

244
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:45,078
Yeah,

245
00:15:45,078 --> 00:15:47,747
well, my work here is done.

246
00:15:47,747 --> 00:15:52,285
Wait, Matt,
will we ever see you again?

247
00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:54,688
Depends on where you look.

248
00:16:04,806 --> 00:16:06,315
ZOO

249
00:16:06,315 --> 00:16:08,964
>>> I JUST HAD TO GET OUT OF THE
APARTMENT.
>> OF COURSE.

250
00:16:08,964 --> 00:16:10,755
>> I CAN'T BELIEVE I GOT FIRED.

251
00:16:10,755 --> 00:16:13,119
THEY DIDN'T EVEN GIVE ME A
WARNING.

252
00:16:16,675 --> 00:16:19,359
HELEN, ARE YOU OKAY?
>> WHAT?

253
00:16:19,359 --> 00:16:23,646
OH -- YEAH SORRY.
YOU KNOW WHAT?
GO ON WITHOUT ME.

254
00:16:26,718 --> 00:16:30,225
* THE TINY BABY SHOE

255
00:16:30,225 --> 00:16:33,671
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ZOO *

256
00:16:33,671 --> 00:16:38,005
* I CAN'T KEEP WALKING AND
PRETEND I DIDN'T SEE IT WHEN I
DID *

257
00:16:38,005 --> 00:16:41,252
* AND IT'S CHANGING ME INSIDE *

258

260
00:16:49,128 --> 00:16:51,344
* CAN'T THROW IT AWAY
IT'S NOT TRASH *

261
00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:53,202
* A PIECE OF MY FUTURE A PART OF
YOUR PAST *

262
00:16:53,202 --> 00:16:54,513
* A BABY

263
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:56,304
THAT'S WHAT I'LL DO *

264
00:16:56,304 --> 00:17:00,661
* SOMEWHERE THERE'S A TINY
CINDERELLA *

265
00:17:00,661 --> 00:17:04,288
* WELL I'M COMING FOR YOU

00:17:08,511 --> 00:17:12,049
* YOU'VE GOT A MOM, WELL NOW

271
00:17:19,458 --> 00:17:23,759
* HOW ABOUT YOU

272
00:17:23,759 --> 00:17:27,817
* WELL, THESE ARE THE ONLY
BABIES I SEE *

273
00:17:27,817 --> 00:17:31,332
* ACTUALLY THE SHOE BELONGS TO
ME *

274
00:17:31,332 --> 00:17:35,022
* I'M A FULLY GROWN-ASS MAN

00:17:50,213 --> 00:17:54,044

284
00:18:08,762 --> 00:18:10,414
>> OH, NO, SORRY, WHAT?

285
00:18:10,414 --> 00:18:13,695
>> YOU AND I ARE GOING TO DATE
NOW, RIGHT?
'CAUSE YOU FOUND MY SHOE.

286
00:18:13,695 --> 00:18:15,574
>> I WAS LOOKING FOR A BABY.

287
00:18:15,574 --> 00:18:19,599
>> NO, YOU THOUGHT YOU WERE
LOOKING FOR A BABY, BUT YOU WERE
LOOKING FOR ME.

288
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:21,819
DING DONG BING BONG, HERE I AM.

289
00:18:21,819 --> 00:18:24,674
* SHE FINALLY FOUND HER MAN

290
00:18:24,674 --> 00:18:27,823
AND THEY MADE LOVE ON THE CAROUSEL *

291
00:18:27,823 --> 00:18:29,630
>> NO, WE'RE NOT A COUPLE.

292
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:33,495
>> WELL, DAMN.
I'M BEING STRAIGHT-UP GASSED
WITH IT RIGHT NOW.

293
00:18:33,495 --> 00:18:37,896
I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE THINKING.
HE HAS SMALL FEET, IS HIS OTHER
PART SMALL TOO?

294
00:18:37,896 --> 00:18:38,971
>> I WAS NOT THINKING THAT.

295
00:18:38,971 --> 00:18:43,906
>> WELL, I'LL ASK YOU THIS.
IS TWO INCHES SMALL?
>> YEAH.

296
00:18:45,136 --> 00:18:47,400
OH, OH, MY GOD, I DIDN'T MEAN TO
UPSET YOU.

297
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:50,759
>> WELL, YOU DID.
YOU LEAVE ME BE.

298
00:18:50,759 --> 00:18:53,164
I'D WALK AWAY MYSELF, BUT I'M
TIRED.

299
00:18:53,164 --> 00:18:55,935
I'VE ALREADY WALKED LIKE 45,000
STEPS TODAY.

300
00:18:55,935 --> 00:18:59,142
I'VE ONLY BEEN AWAKE FOR 20
MINUTES.

301
00:18:59,474 --> 00:19:02,185
>> HEY, I'M SAM ROCKWELL.

302
00:19:02,185 --> 00:19:05,095
I THINK WE'VE ALL LEARNED A VERY
VALUABLE LESSON TODAY.

303
00:19:05,095 --> 00:19:07,282
CINDERELLA RULES AREN'T
REAL-LIFE RULES.

304
00:19:07,282 --> 00:19:09,182
>> HEY, MAN, MIND YOUR BUSINESS.

305
00:19:09,182 --> 00:19:11,274
>> HEY, MAN, EXCUSE ME?

306
00:19:11,274 --> 00:19:14,493
>> YOU JUST WALK AROUND THE
PARK, INTERRUPTING CONVERSATIONS
WITH NUGGETS OF WISDOM?

307
00:19:14,493 --> 00:19:16,731
>> NO, WHAT I DO IS MAKE BALLOON
ANIMALS.

308
00:19:16,731 --> 00:19:17,744
I THINK WE'RE ALL SET.

309
00:19:17,744 --> 00:19:20,003
>> EXCUSE ME, I'M TALKING.

310
00:19:20,003 --> 00:19:23,417
>> YOU KNOW WHAT, I DON'T NEED
TO EXPLAIN MYSELF TO YOU, TO
YOU.

311
00:19:23,417 --> 00:19:25,665
I'M LEAVING, I'M OUT OF HERE.

312
00:19:29,206 --> 00:19:31,186
>> I GUESS THE LESSON HERE IS --

313
00:19:31,186 --> 00:19:35,225
* WHEN YOU FIND A BABY SHOE *
>> NOT SO TINY.

314
00:19:35,225 --> 00:19:38,993
* THAT FITS JUST LIKE A GLOVE *

315
00:19:38,993 --> 00:19:42,585
* JUST GO ABOUT YOUR DAY *

316
00:19:42,585 --> 00:19:48,020
* YOU DON'T NEED TO DO THAT
GIRL *
* IT WON'T BE YOU'RE IN LOVE *

317
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:52,521
* NO, NO IT DON'T MEAN THAT AT
ALL *

318
00:20:00,767 --> 00:20:03,870
Mother's day
brunch at Lillard's in the park.

319
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:05,638
I am so impressed.

320
00:20:05,638 --> 00:20:08,241
How did you boys
get a reservation?

321
00:20:08,241 --> 00:20:11,411
A little trade secret called
booking at five months ago.

322
00:20:11,411 --> 00:20:14,614
And a little surprise
after this,

323
00:20:14,614 --> 00:20:18,685
we got tickets
to the Botanical Gardens exhibit

324
00:20:18,685 --> 00:20:22,288
and flowers of the 19th century.

325
00:20:22,288 --> 00:20:23,890
I have wanted to go to that.

326
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:25,625
You boys are so sweet.

327
00:20:25,625 --> 00:20:27,527
Oh. Hello there.

328
00:20:27,527 --> 00:20:31,798
My name is Alby,
and I'll be your server

329
00:20:31,798 --> 00:20:34,534
I am sad to say,
a happy Mother's Day, but

330
00:20:34,534 --> 00:20:38,905
all I see a two young men out
with their much younger sisters.

331
00:20:38,905 --> 00:20:42,509
Oh, you're a big.

332
00:20:42,509 --> 00:20:43,743
tip, mister.

333
00:20:43,743 --> 00:20:44,978
No need.

334
00:20:44,978 --> 00:20:48,214
I already have one. Oh!

335
00:20:48,214 --> 00:20:49,716
Oh, no.

336
00:20:49,716 --> 00:20:52,185
Oh. Okay,

337
00:20:52,185 --> 00:20:53,486
go get some menus.

338
00:20:53,486 --> 00:20:56,690
I should warn you, ladies,
I am a big old flirt.

339
00:20:56,690 --> 00:20:57,590
Oh, baby.

340
00:20:57,724 --> 00:21:00,427
You do not want to flirt
with a couple of old moms.

341
00:21:00,427 --> 00:21:01,861
Oh, yes, I do.

342
00:21:01,861 --> 00:21:04,230
I've always been attracted
to mothers.

343
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:07,067
Perhaps it's because my own
mother was such an angel.

344
00:21:07,067 --> 00:21:10,270
Or possibly
because once I came of age,

345
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:15,308
I slept with every single
one of her friends. Oh,

346
00:21:15,308 --> 00:21:19,412
love to peek at some menus.

347
00:21:19,412 --> 00:21:23,283
Needless to say, it's
my lucky day to wait on not one,

348
00:21:23,283 --> 00:21:26,686
but two mature goddesses
dripping in Talbots.

349
00:21:26,686 --> 00:21:29,089
Now please tell me
you all have those comfy kids.

350
00:21:29,089 --> 00:21:30,757
Do you have them on?

351
00:21:30,757 --> 00:21:32,225
Yeah, yeah.

352
00:21:32,225 --> 00:21:34,194
Oh, how did you know? Oh.

353
00:21:34,194 --> 00:21:37,764
Oh, y'all
making a boy sweat over here?

354
00:21:37,764 --> 00:21:41,134
Oh, no.

355
00:21:41,134 --> 00:21:45,605
No. Oh.

356
00:21:45,605 --> 00:21:47,107
All right.

357
00:21:47,107 --> 00:21:51,011
I think we're good
on the flirting with our moms.

358
00:21:51,011 --> 00:21:53,013
Are you Lord Jesus?

359
00:21:53,013 --> 00:21:57,117
No. Then don't be cross.

360
00:21:57,117 --> 00:22:00,720
Just cause your mama baked you
just because you're mama baked

361
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:04,691
you doesn't mean other men
don't want to see the oven. Oh.

362
00:22:04,691 --> 00:22:06,960
You're hysterical.

363
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,095
Oh, we going to have so much fun
out of here.

364
00:22:09,095 --> 00:22:11,431
Okay, how about some menus?

365
00:22:11,431 --> 00:22:12,932
Oh. Thank you.

366
00:22:12,932 --> 00:22:15,268
Alby,

367
00:22:15,268 --> 00:22:16,970
This one's for. You.

368
00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:20,240
Can we snag a couple of those?

369
00:22:25,211 --> 00:22:27,180
Now, can
I start you with some drinks?

370
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:29,849
Oh, or is the mimosa bottomless?

371
00:22:29,849 --> 00:22:30,617
Yes, ma'am.

372
00:22:30,884 --> 00:22:35,121
And maybe after you've
had a couple, you'll be two.

373
00:22:35,121 --> 00:22:35,855
Here.

374
00:22:35,855 --> 00:22:38,658
I'll be two mimosas for us.

375
00:22:38,658 --> 00:22:39,993
How is your sangria?

376
00:22:39,993 --> 00:22:42,128
No idea.

377
00:22:42,128 --> 00:22:44,230
And, I just got a coffee.

378
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:47,133
I don't know, can you.

379
00:22:47,133 --> 00:22:49,369
I'll get those mimosas for you.

380
00:22:49,369 --> 00:22:50,670
Okay.

381
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:53,139
Do you want us to ask
for a different server?

382
00:22:53,139 --> 00:22:55,742
Oh, stop. Alby's harmless.

383
00:22:55,742 --> 00:22:57,210
He's harmless.

384
00:22:57,210 --> 00:23:00,213
Look at him.

385
00:23:06,519 --> 00:23:08,955
You guys,
this is an expensive brunch, and

386
00:23:08,955 --> 00:23:12,092
I just want to make sure it's
a good experience for everybody.

387
00:23:12,092 --> 00:23:16,730
Well, if you stop
being so uptight, it will be.

388
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:19,866
Here are your mimosas.

389
00:23:19,866 --> 00:23:23,370
Did you unbutton your shirt
more?

390
00:23:23,370 --> 00:23:25,405
Yes, I did.

391
00:23:25,405 --> 00:23:27,774
Your turn. Ladies.

392
00:23:27,774 --> 00:23:30,477
Oh, my God, I'm so silly today.

393
00:23:30,477 --> 00:23:31,644
Dude. For real?

394
00:23:31,644 --> 00:23:33,346
Stop! You're being. Gross.

395
00:23:33,346 --> 00:23:34,814
Calm down boy.

396
00:23:34,814 --> 00:23:36,883
You've got to spend
nine months inside your mom.

397
00:23:36,883 --> 00:23:40,220
I'm just
trying to get 20 minutes.

398
00:23:43,089 --> 00:23:45,492
You know, Ali, do
you have any butter substitute?

399
00:23:45,492 --> 00:23:46,626
Like a margarine.

400
00:23:46,626 --> 00:23:49,129
You know, if I have dairy,
I will be gassy

401
00:23:49,129 --> 00:23:50,497
for the whole rest of the day.

402
00:23:50,497 --> 00:23:52,599
So I've never complained about

403
00:23:52,599 --> 00:23:56,903
a breeze
blowing through my hair. Oh.

404
00:23:56,903 --> 00:24:01,608
Jesus, dude.

405
00:24:01,608 --> 00:24:03,510
Oh, I'm a handful today.

406
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:06,413
Then I have.

407
00:24:06,413 --> 00:24:08,748
Oh, I'm getting a rush of blood
somewhere as well.

408
00:24:08,748 --> 00:24:10,750
Thank the Lord
I'm wearing this apron

409
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:16,456
because I'm about to have a hat
rack down here.

410
00:24:16,456 --> 00:24:18,558
Prove it

411
00:24:18,558 --> 00:24:20,960
Mom, what?

412
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:24,664
Everyone just order, please.

413
00:24:24,664 --> 00:24:27,634
Okay, we'll all have the brunch
special.

414
00:24:27,634 --> 00:24:30,570
I'll go put that in now
and maybe later.

415
00:24:30,570 --> 00:24:31,471
Wait, let me guess.

416
00:24:31,471 --> 00:24:34,941
And maybe later
I'll put something else in.

417
00:24:34,941 --> 00:24:38,345
Hey, watch your tongue.

418
00:24:38,345 --> 00:24:42,115
How dare you talk about that way
around your mama?

419
00:24:42,115 --> 00:24:44,284
Don't ruin today for me, son.

420
00:24:44,284 --> 00:24:46,353
Yeah,

421
00:24:46,353 --> 00:24:49,155
I'll do
all the ruining around him.

422
00:24:49,155 --> 00:24:51,591
Oh, your trouble

423
00:25:05,839 --> 00:25:08,608
Good afternoon, everyone, and
thank you so much for attending

424
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:12,779
this preview of our upcoming
production, handful of Hope.

425
00:25:12,779 --> 00:25:13,313
You may notice

426
00:25:13,947 --> 00:25:17,617
we have some unusual guests
in the audience today, 20 dogs

427
00:25:17,617 --> 00:25:21,388
from Canine Companions who,
as part of their service dog

428
00:25:21,388 --> 00:25:26,292
training, must learn how to sit
through a full length play.

429
00:25:30,063 --> 00:25:32,532
And again,
welcome people and dogs.

430
00:25:32,532 --> 00:25:36,603
I think you'll all really enjoy
hand full of Hope.

431
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:42,909
It was 1958.

432
00:25:42,909 --> 00:25:47,080
Chuck Berry taken over the radio
with Johnny B good.

433
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:50,750
Nothing would be good for this
Johnny that's similar.

434
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:53,520
Not as my alcoholic half sister
Janelle

435
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:56,523
had anything to say about it.

436
00:26:01,027 --> 00:26:02,696
Dinah, what are you doing here?

437
00:26:02,696 --> 00:26:05,165
I'm pretty sure daddy told
you never to come back here.

438
00:26:05,165 --> 00:26:05,665
Yeah, yeah.

439
00:26:06,332 --> 00:26:10,036
Yeah, I know he told me never
to come back here. You hear

440
00:26:10,036 --> 00:26:10,704
the back here?

441
00:26:10,704 --> 00:26:14,674
You hear I came.

442
00:26:14,674 --> 00:26:16,042
I'm sorry.

443
00:26:16,042 --> 00:26:17,677
I really hate
to break character,

444
00:26:17,677 --> 00:26:23,650
but I do notice that dogs
keep leaving the,

445
00:26:23,650 --> 00:26:26,853
It's very hard to act
when that's happening.

446
00:26:26,853 --> 00:26:28,521
I'm. I'm so sorry.

447
00:26:28,521 --> 00:26:30,223
I'm one of the dog trainers.

448
00:26:30,223 --> 00:26:31,624
Please don't be offended.

449
00:26:31,624 --> 00:26:35,862
This is their first time
at a bad play.

450
00:26:35,862 --> 00:26:37,397
Well, I like the show,

451
00:26:37,397 --> 00:26:40,400
and I think my dog does too.

452
00:26:44,537 --> 00:26:45,238
Well, we are going to.

453
00:26:45,238 --> 00:26:46,106
Ask the dog.

454
00:26:46,106 --> 00:26:47,540
Stay as still as possible,

455
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:51,411
please,
so the actors can concentrate.

456
00:26:51,411 --> 00:26:53,146
Absolutely. So sorry.

457
00:26:53,146 --> 00:26:55,915
be good? be good?

458
00:26:55,915 --> 00:26:57,650
You see, my sisters better days

459
00:26:57,650 --> 00:27:00,920
inside a bottle of cheap
champagne.

460
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:04,157
Said she loved how the bubbles
tickled her nose.

461
00:27:04,157 --> 00:27:07,193
But one day the bubbles began
to tickle her

462
00:27:07,193 --> 00:27:10,196
brain.

463
00:27:12,332 --> 00:27:13,466
My brain?

464
00:27:13,466 --> 00:27:14,868
Fine, I tell you.

465
00:27:14,868 --> 00:27:18,038
Finer
than the softest silks in China.

466
00:27:18,038 --> 00:27:22,375
Now I just need to put a bird,
pick me up and carry me there.

467
00:27:22,375 --> 00:27:24,210
Oh, how? Stop it!

468
00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:27,614
Oh my
God, what what what what now?

469
00:27:27,614 --> 00:27:28,548
I'm sorry.

470
00:27:28,548 --> 00:27:30,450
My dog
keeps hitting me in the ribs

471
00:27:30,450 --> 00:27:32,652
and then pointing at the stage,
kind of like.

472
00:27:32,652 --> 00:27:33,053
You see?

473
00:27:33,053 --> 00:27:36,389
And this.

474
00:27:36,389 --> 00:27:36,723
Yeah.

475
00:27:37,223 --> 00:27:38,558
And my dog
keeps looking at the program

476
00:27:38,558 --> 00:27:42,062
to see who the producers are.

477
00:27:43,496 --> 00:27:44,531
Okay, you know what?

478
00:27:44,531 --> 00:27:46,633
Let's just skip
to the end of the first act

479
00:27:46,633 --> 00:27:47,867
and we can get this
all sorted out.

480
00:27:47,867 --> 00:27:50,437
I didn't go to Juilliard, so
I can act with a bunch of dogs.

481
00:27:50,437 --> 00:27:52,072
Okay, well,
you didn't go to Juilliard

482
00:27:52,072 --> 00:27:56,276
for any reason, Daniel,
because you didn't get it.

483
00:27:56,276 --> 00:27:56,776
Wait a second.

484
00:27:56,943 --> 00:27:59,112
I'm sorry. Is your dog asleep?

485
00:27:59,112 --> 00:28:00,547
Oh, no.

486
00:28:00,547 --> 00:28:03,683
wide awake

487
00:28:03,683 --> 00:28:06,853
Can I ask a question?

488
00:28:06,853 --> 00:28:09,622
Is. Yes, I have a question.

489
00:28:09,622 --> 00:28:10,256
I'm sorry.

490
00:28:10,256 --> 00:28:11,758
Is this for

491
00:28:11,758 --> 00:28:17,364
I shouldn't have brought the
button mat treat treat, treat.

492
00:28:17,364 --> 00:28:19,766
Okay, just skip to the end.

493
00:28:19,766 --> 00:28:20,233
Johnny.

494
00:28:20,367 --> 00:28:22,235
No, don't leave me again.

495
00:28:22,235 --> 00:28:24,070
I know
that's not what she wants.

496
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:26,806
You have no clue what I want,
Joel.

497
00:28:26,806 --> 00:28:30,510
No. Now, don't ask.

498
00:28:32,512 --> 00:28:36,049
Oh, he kissed his sister.

499
00:28:36,049 --> 00:28:37,050
Rose.

500
00:28:37,050 --> 00:28:39,853
You kissed me.

501
00:28:39,853 --> 00:28:43,156
That's different.

502
00:28:43,156 --> 00:28:44,958
I guess my train can wait.

503

I guess that's the nicest thing
anyone's ever said to me.

504
00:28:48,828 --> 00:28:51,297
But what will you say to me.

505
00:28:51,297 --> 00:28:56,403

Thank you.
Thank you very much.

00:34:20,981 --> 00:34:24,194
Thank you.
Thanks. Good evening everyone.

584
00:34:24,194 --> 00:34:27,735
Welcome to Weekend
Update I'm Michael che.
I'm Colin Jost.

585
00:34:29,533 --> 00:34:33,867
Well, the Catholic Church
has elected the first ever pope
from America.

586
00:34:33,867 --> 00:34:37,335
And as an American Catholic,
I could not be more proud.

587
00:34:37,335 --> 00:34:40,391
Which is a sin.
And now I'm ashamed.

588
00:34:41,415 --> 00:34:44,966
The Vatican has selected
Cardinal Robert Francis Prevost,

589
00:34:44,966 --> 00:34:47,947
who is from the South side
of Chicago, to be the new pope.

590
00:34:47,947 --> 00:34:52,205
And you can tell
he's from the South Side,
because he's got his hands
up.

591
00:34:56,433 --> 00:34:59,339
This pic was actually
a welcome surprise for me,

592
00:34:59,339 --> 00:35:04,026
because when I heard the Pope
was a super religious guy
from Chicago in a funny robe,

593
00:35:04,026 --> 00:35:06,652
I was worried it was Kanye.

594
00:35:08,664 --> 00:35:13,745
I also love that conservatives
are already complaining
that this pope is too woke.

595
00:35:13,846 --> 00:35:17,462
How woke can a 69 year
old man from Chicago be?

596
00:35:17,462 --> 00:35:19,464
It's not like he came out
and was like,

597
00:35:19,464 --> 00:35:23,305
hey, I'm Pope Leo the 14th.
He him.

598
00:35:24,088 --> 00:35:27,293
The reality is,
there are no woke Catholics.

599
00:35:27,293 --> 00:35:31,367
If you're a woke Catholic, you're
just not Catholic anymore.

600
00:35:31,367 --> 00:35:33,827
Joe Biden appeared on The View,

601
00:35:33,827 --> 00:35:37,192
where he said he wasn't surprised
Kamala Harris lost the election,

602
00:35:37,192 --> 00:35:42,049
because the only thing
that surprises
Joe Biden are the words
that come out of his own mouth.

603
00:35:42,977 --> 00:35:47,831
President
Trump says he will appoint
Fox News host
Jeanine Pirro

604
00:35:47,831 --> 00:35:50,883
as interim U.S.
attorney for Washington, D.C..

605
00:35:50,883 --> 00:35:53,377
Pirro celebrated the news
with a bottle of wine

606
00:35:53,377 --> 00:35:56,068
every day
for the last 50 years.

607
00:35:56,821 --> 00:36:00,372
President Trump also announced
a new trade deal with the U.K.

608
00:36:00,372 --> 00:36:03,688
that will reopen British markets
for American companies.

609
00:36:03,688 --> 00:36:08,957
All that
Britain demands in return
is that we keep these two.

610
00:36:13,293 --> 00:36:17,373
Insiders are saying
that President Trump
is trying to create tension

611
00:36:17,373 --> 00:36:21,474
between his potential
successors -
Marco Rubio and JD Vance,

612
00:36:21,474 --> 00:36:25,648
mostly
by pointing at them
and saying, kiss.

613
00:36:27,884 --> 00:36:32,141
President Trump
announced plans
for a 100% tariff

614
00:36:32,141 --> 00:36:34,330
on movies
made outside the U.S.,

615
00:36:34,330 --> 00:36:36,994
which is no problem for me
because all the movies I watch

616
00:36:36,994 --> 00:36:40,899
were filmed in a Florida condo
on a leather couch.

617
00:36:44,867 --> 00:36:47,918
If you laugh, you're a fan too.

618
00:36:47,918 --> 00:36:51,942
President Trump said he was
interested in reopening Alcatraz

619
00:36:51,942 --> 00:36:54,022
because it represents something
horrible

620
00:36:54,022 --> 00:36:57,091
and beautiful and strong
and miserable and weak.

621
00:36:57,091 --> 00:37:01,304
What's also his nickname
for his five children?

622
00:37:06,288 --> 00:37:10,476
A new report shows that
there have been at least nine
incidents at Newark Airport,

623
00:37:10,476 --> 00:37:15,149
where air traffic controllers
have lost contact with planes
that were about to land.

624
00:37:15,149 --> 00:37:19,688
But
luckily, it's Newark, so planes
can just follow the smell.

625
00:37:21,178 --> 00:37:27,412
Insiders at the FBI are concerned
that Director
Kash Patel is not at work enough,

626
00:37:27,412 --> 00:37:30,896
and is often seen
attending sporting events
with celebrities.

627
00:37:30,896 --> 00:37:34,841
But like his eyes, Patel
can be in two places at once.

628
00:37:37,046 --> 00:37:42,081
The white House marked Star Wars
Day by posting an AI
generated picture

629
00:37:42,081 --> 00:37:45,455
of President
Trump as a musclebound Jedi.

630
00:37:45,455 --> 00:37:49,445
And they also posted
a picture of JD the Hutt.

631
00:37:52,709 --> 00:37:56,558
The first week of jury selection
in the Sean Combs trial

632
00:37:56,558 --> 00:37:59,189
has ended
without a jury being selected.

633
00:37:59,189 --> 00:38:02,011
Well, yeah,
I mean, where are you going
to find 12 people

634
00:38:02,011 --> 00:38:04,851
who
haven't had sex with Diddy.

635
00:38:06,173 --> 00:38:08,407
In New York City?

636
00:38:09,226 --> 00:38:13,126
Big city Mayor Eric Adams met
with President Trump yesterday

637
00:38:13,126 --> 00:38:14,963
to discuss the city's
concerns,

638
00:38:14,963 --> 00:38:17,890
namely that Trump's deportations
have dramatically cut

639
00:38:17,890 --> 00:38:21,186
New York's
supply of thick shorties

640
00:38:23,799 --> 00:38:25,482
I love that man

641
00:38:25,482 --> 00:38:27,888
President, Trump
says Catholics loved

642
00:38:27,888 --> 00:38:31,095
an image he posted of him
dressed as the Pope last week.

643
00:38:31,095 --> 00:38:34,751
But I just find it
hard to believe that
anyone in the Catholic Church

644
00:38:34,751 --> 00:38:37,858
would be into something
so juvenile.

645
00:38:44,432 --> 00:38:49,376
Well, with box office
hits like sinners,
Thunderbolts, and Minecraft.

646
00:38:49,376 --> 00:38:51,646
Summer movie
season is in full swing

647
00:38:51,646 --> 00:38:56,584
here with his preview of the upcoming
summer blockbusters.
Is the movie guy.

648
00:38:59,871 --> 00:39:03,909
Hope the movie God.

649
00:39:03,909 --> 00:39:08,697
And you're
not going to believe it.
But I'm here
to talk about the movies.

650
00:39:08,697 --> 00:39:11,115
That's great. Yes.

651
00:39:11,115 --> 00:39:13,889
Well, first off, I got to know
what is your take on sinners?

652
00:39:13,889 --> 00:39:16,226
Yes. Sinners.

653
00:39:16,226 --> 00:39:21,795
This is an amazing movie
about people who are doing sins.

654
00:39:21,795 --> 00:39:24,798
But I
do have one sin to confess.

655
00:39:24,798 --> 00:39:28,802
I did not see that one yet.

656
00:39:28,802 --> 00:39:29,703
Okay.

657
00:39:29,703 --> 00:39:30,203
All right, well,

658
00:39:30,704 --> 00:39:32,038
what movies can
we look forward to this summer?

659
00:39:32,038 --> 00:39:35,375
Oh, thank you
for asking that one.

660
00:39:35,375 --> 00:39:37,677
The first movie that's coming up

661
00:39:37,677 --> 00:39:41,581
is Jurassic World The Rebirth.

662
00:39:41,581 --> 00:39:44,217
They gave me early access
to this movie,

663
00:39:44,217 --> 00:39:50,423
and I have to tell you,
I did not see that one yet.

664
00:39:50,423 --> 00:39:54,427
But I can guess what
going to happen

665
00:39:54,427 --> 00:39:56,496
in the beginning of this movie.

666
00:39:56,496 --> 00:39:59,566
Everything. That's okay, guys.

667
00:39:59,566 --> 00:40:01,634
No problem here.

668
00:40:01,634 --> 00:40:03,703
The dinosaur is in jail.

669
00:40:03,703 --> 00:40:07,273
Hey, everybody,
don't worry about it.

670
00:40:07,273 --> 00:40:11,878
But then the dinosaur escaped,

671
00:40:11,878 --> 00:40:14,447
and the only person
that can stop them

672
00:40:14,447 --> 00:40:18,218
is Scarlett Johansson

673
00:40:18,218 --> 00:40:21,588
I'm sorry. Who?

674
00:40:21,588 --> 00:40:24,491
Scarlett Johansson

675
00:40:24,491 --> 00:40:25,291
Yeah.

676
00:40:25,291 --> 00:40:26,760
You know.

677
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,995
You know where you see Avengers?

678
00:40:28,995 --> 00:40:31,664
Yes. Oh, Scarlett Johansson.
Yes. That's my wife.

679
00:40:31,664 --> 00:40:32,999
Yeah, yeah.

680
00:40:32,999 --> 00:40:37,303
And my wife is Rihanna.

681
00:40:37,303 --> 00:40:40,306
To the umbrella.

682
00:40:43,643 --> 00:40:46,846
I don't like
how hard you guys are laughing.

683
00:40:46,846 --> 00:40:49,015
Let's just move on
to the next summer movie.

684
00:40:49,015 --> 00:40:52,352
And remember, you don't have to
guess what the plot is.

685
00:40:52,352 --> 00:40:54,454
You must not know about me.

686
00:40:54,454 --> 00:40:57,824
You must not know about me.

687
00:40:57,824 --> 00:41:01,094
I'm going to do exactly the.

688
00:41:01,094 --> 00:41:02,829
The next movie from

689
00:41:02,829 --> 00:41:05,965
the summer is Fantastic Four.

690
00:41:05,965 --> 00:41:08,968
I imagine this movie
going to be about

691
00:41:08,968 --> 00:41:13,106
three, maybe four people.

692
00:41:13,106 --> 00:41:16,643
And they probably fantastic.

693
00:41:16,643 --> 00:41:17,077
Yeah.

694
00:41:17,510 --> 00:41:20,280
But you know
somebody who not fantastic.

695
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:22,982
Gary Fields.

696
00:41:22,982 --> 00:41:24,951
Who is Gary Fields?

697
00:41:24,951 --> 00:41:28,655
You know Gary Fields.

698
00:41:30,690 --> 00:41:31,791
He hate Monday

699
00:41:31,791 --> 00:41:35,428
even though he don't have a job

700
00:41:35,428 --> 00:41:37,097
every day. The same for a cat.

701
00:41:37,097 --> 00:41:40,367
Am I right, guys?

702
00:41:40,367 --> 00:41:41,301
I'm on.

703
00:41:41,301 --> 00:41:44,237
You're wrong. No.

704
00:41:44,237 --> 00:41:48,108
Did you like ball field
material now? Yes,

705
00:41:49,376 --> 00:41:52,512
but we got to talk about karate,
Keith.

706
00:41:52,512 --> 00:41:53,446
Oh, yes.

707
00:41:53,513 --> 00:41:56,449
If I had to guess,
it would be like the first one

708
00:41:56,449 --> 00:42:01,321
where a Chinese guy
teach a little boy to wack off.

709
00:42:02,956 --> 00:42:05,191
And I'm sorry.

710
00:42:05,191 --> 00:42:09,329
You know, waCk on, wack off.

711
00:42:09,329 --> 00:42:10,830
it|s wax

712
00:42:10,830 --> 00:42:13,833
not sure if he had the kid wax
before.

713
00:42:17,971 --> 00:42:18,672
Can we.

714
00:42:18,672 --> 00:42:20,140
Just get back to the movies?

715
00:42:20,140 --> 00:42:21,941
What about Superman?

716
00:42:21,941 --> 00:42:24,544
I don't know who that is, but.

717
00:42:24,544 --> 00:42:28,381
But you know who
the real superhero.

718
00:42:28,381 --> 00:42:31,518
Single mothers of

719
00:42:34,754 --> 00:42:36,256
Can't do that.

720
00:42:36,256 --> 00:42:36,723
All right.

721
00:42:37,323 --> 00:42:39,959
Movie guy, anything
you want to cover before we go.

722
00:42:39,959 --> 00:42:43,963
Yes, I have a joke.

723
00:42:43,963 --> 00:42:46,099
A joke? Yeah.

724
00:42:46,099 --> 00:42:48,735
The joke is.

725
00:42:48,735 --> 00:42:53,573
Gatorade zero zero.

726
00:42:53,573 --> 00:42:57,877
What's in there?

727
00:42:57,877 --> 00:43:00,413
Am I right, guys?

728
00:43:00,413 --> 00:43:04,317
Movie guy everyone

729
00:43:11,892 --> 00:43:15,641
Weight watchers said that
it is filing for bankruptcy protection

730
00:43:15,641 --> 00:43:18,538
to eliminate
more than $1 billion in debt.

731
00:43:18,538 --> 00:43:21,465
But, you know, they're
just going to gain it all back.

732
00:43:24,558 --> 00:43:29,459
American Airlines has introduced
a new first class option
called Flagship Suites

733
00:43:29,459 --> 00:43:34,291
that features privacy doors,
a cool touch pillow, and a lie
flat bed.

734
00:43:34,291 --> 00:43:37,848
American Airlines
get pregnant with us.

735
00:43:39,605 --> 00:43:43,996
K-pop star Lisa
is being criticized
for her Met Gala outfit

736
00:43:43,996 --> 00:43:47,992
that appeared to feature images
of Rosa Parks on the crotch.

737
00:43:47,992 --> 00:43:52,187
But at least
they put her in the front.

738
00:43:57,247 --> 00:43:59,504
Am I right?

739
00:44:08,868 --> 00:44:12,901
A Lamborghini yacht off
the coast of Miami Beach sank

740
00:44:12,901 --> 00:44:16,577
while carrying more than 30
social media influencers

741
00:44:16,577 --> 00:44:18,429
like.

742
00:44:22,861 --> 00:44:26,819
The U.S. Navy said that for the second
week in a row,

743
00:44:26,819 --> 00:44:31,754
F-18
fighter jet fell off an aircraft
carrier into the ocean.

744
00:44:31,754 --> 00:44:36,038
Well, thankfully,
there's nobody at the bottom
of the ocean
who could use two airplanes.

745
00:44:36,038 --> 00:44:38,213
Oh, God.

746
00:44:40,406 --> 00:44:45,639
Experts are noting
that the R-word has become
more commonplace

747
00:44:45,639 --> 00:44:48,737
due to its use
by people like Elon Musk.
And yay!

748
00:44:48,737 --> 00:44:52,492
Yeah, well,
they can say it because they're.

749
00:44:53,603 --> 00:44:56,836
Rich.
They're rich.

750
00:44:56,836 --> 00:44:59,280
Oh. Just get me.

751
00:44:59,342 --> 00:45:04,304
President Trump's tariffs are
having massive cascading effects
on global trade.

752
00:45:04,304 --> 00:45:07,087
Here to unpack
how this will affect you
The consumer

753
00:45:07,087 --> 00:45:10,779
is a guy who just
walked into a spiderweb. Oh.

754
00:45:12,242 --> 00:45:13,865
Oh oh, I'm so sorry.

755
00:45:13,865 --> 00:45:16,245
I just walked into a spider web.

756
00:45:16,245 --> 00:45:20,479
Oh, there was a spider in it.
I felt something like, hit
my shoulder.

757
00:45:20,479 --> 00:45:22,792
Is there anything on me?

758
00:45:22,792 --> 00:45:25,846
Oh, I really
I don't see anything.

759
00:45:25,846 --> 00:45:27,926
I'm sorry.
I don't see anything.

760
00:45:27,926 --> 00:45:30,211
Why don't
we just take us through
what's going on
with these tariffs?

761
00:45:30,211 --> 00:45:33,394
Because the more I hear
about the tariffs,
the more confused I get.

762
00:45:33,394 --> 00:45:35,727
Yeah.
Well, I like to tell

763
00:45:35,727 --> 00:45:39,355
I feel something.
There's a spider on there.

764
00:45:39,749 --> 00:45:44,808
on me
and I'm feeling okay.

765
00:45:44,808 --> 00:45:50,261
I feel I feel good.

766
00:45:56,443 --> 00:46:00,110
Where

767
00:46:00,110 --> 00:46:03,603
Know

768
00:46:03,603 --> 00:46:06,470
It's there.
It's there.

769
00:46:08,517 --> 00:46:11,537
Oh, God.
Oh my God.

770
00:46:11,537 --> 00:46:13,773
I'm so sorry.

771
00:46:13,773 --> 00:46:16,554
I felt it on my skin.

772
00:46:16,554 --> 00:46:19,153
On my skin?

773
00:46:23,250 --> 00:46:25,532
I'm so sorry.

774
00:46:26,070 --> 00:46:28,301
Feel sorry.

775
00:46:40,501 --> 00:46:42,020
Should I still talk about
tariffs?

776
00:46:42,020 --> 00:46:44,018
Get out

777
00:46:44,018 --> 00:46:47,205
You just walk into a spider web.

778
00:46:52,790 --> 00:46:56,682
What?
What is the show?

779
00:46:57,093 --> 00:47:00,136
85 year old Motown legend Smokey Robinson

780
00:47:00,136 --> 00:47:04,794
has been accused
of sexual assault
by four of his former
housekeepers.

781
00:47:04,794 --> 00:47:08,777
Robinson plans to beat
the charges by being dead soon.

782
00:47:14,364 --> 00:47:16,966
After a spider

783
00:47:16,966 --> 00:47:22,164
and a new report lists
the happiest city in the U.S.
as New York.

784
00:47:22,164 --> 00:47:24,018
Yeah.

785
00:47:25,405 --> 00:47:28,362
I don't know who took that
survey.

786
00:47:28,362 --> 00:47:30,548
The happiest city in the U.S.
was New York.

787
00:47:30,548 --> 00:47:34,652
While the least happy
Dick splinter North Dakota.

788
00:47:38,058 --> 00:47:40,498
- It's rough city, man.
- That's

789
00:47:40,498 --> 00:47:43,908
the makers of the Grand
Theft Auto video game series
Announced

790
00:47:43,908 --> 00:47:48,620
that the release of the
newest version of the game
will be delayed until May 2026.

791
00:47:48,620 --> 00:47:52,757
And you know what? Good.
Maybe kids will finally turn off
their PlayStations,

792
00:47:52,757 --> 00:47:56,622
go outside and slap
a real prostitute.

793
00:47:59,746 --> 00:48:03,782
A doctor in Scotland
who secretly hid cameras
in his bathroom

794
00:48:03,782 --> 00:48:07,224
so he could compare the size
of his penis
to other men,

795
00:48:07,224 --> 00:48:09,845
has been sentenced
to 18 months in prison,

796
00:48:09,845 --> 00:48:12,711
where his studies continue.

797
00:48:16,510 --> 00:48:19,853
Well, it is Mother's Day.

798
00:48:20,413 --> 00:48:22,644
No good transition.

799
00:48:22,644 --> 00:48:26,110
It's Mother's Day
and spring has sprung here
in New York City,

800
00:48:26,110 --> 00:48:27,684
which means more tourists
than ever.

801
00:48:27,684 --> 00:48:29,952
Here, with her
tips on how to survive the Big Apple

802
00:48:29,952 --> 00:48:34,683
is Diane,
the mom who's only read
about New York on Facebook.

803
00:48:37,152 --> 00:48:39,268
I love New York. Yay!

804
00:48:39,268 --> 00:48:42,659
Hello. Hello, Diane. Welcome.
Do you want to?
You want to put your bag down?

805
00:48:42,659 --> 00:48:44,918
Oh. Nice try guy.

806
00:48:46,838 --> 00:48:49,789
All right.
Any any tips from your visit
so far?

807
00:48:49,789 --> 00:48:53,560
Yes.
New York is a beautiful city.

808
00:48:53,560 --> 00:48:56,388
You can go to Central Park,
home of the Mets,

809
00:48:56,388 --> 00:48:59,995
and, yeah, a thousand crackheads and that.
Thanks.

810
00:48:59,995 --> 00:49:04,797
I'll stay in my hotel room with
my QVC and my deadbolt locks.

811
00:49:04,797 --> 00:49:08,198
Okay. Well, Dan, sorry.
New York is really not that bad.

812
00:49:08,198 --> 00:49:10,447
No, Colin.
It is.

813
00:49:10,447 --> 00:49:12,985
Okay,
so I read a post, all right,

814
00:49:12,985 --> 00:49:17,561
about a woman,
my neighborhood, my
age, white.

815
00:49:18,384 --> 00:49:21,615
Mother of four.
She is in New York. Okay.

816
00:49:21,615 --> 00:49:25,044
Takes the subway.
Two stops later,
her AirPods are missing.

817
00:49:25,044 --> 00:49:28,152
She's got two face tattoos,
and she's a Crip

818
00:49:28,152 --> 00:49:31,438
showing up currently
at the Marriott Fitness Center.

819
00:49:31,438 --> 00:49:34,183
I really can't believe that's
true, Diane,

820
00:49:34,183 --> 00:49:35,662
I'll say. You seem a little on edge.

821
00:49:35,662 --> 00:49:38,333
I'm on edge.
I'm not on anything.

822
00:49:38,333 --> 00:49:40,952
I'm not smoking,
not chopped cheese.

823
00:49:40,952 --> 00:49:44,223
Okay? I'm high.
I'm high on two things.

824
00:49:44,223 --> 00:49:47,556
Jamba Juice or.

825
00:49:47,556 --> 00:49:50,166
Oh, okay.
Do you do
you have any other tips?

826
00:49:50,166 --> 00:49:53,815
Yeah.
Hey, don't buy a single thing,
okay?

827
00:49:53,815 --> 00:49:55,699
Cause listen to this, all right?

828
00:49:55,699 --> 00:49:58,484
I read it, I read a post.

829
00:49:58,484 --> 00:50:00,806
Oh, about a woman.
Same school district.

830
00:50:00,806 --> 00:50:03,551
Okay. My age. White.

831
00:50:03,551 --> 00:50:07,184
This is New York. Okay.
What's a pair of sunglasses?
Oh, okay.

832
00:50:07,184 --> 00:50:10,555
Vendor seems nice.
Cuts her deal. She puts them on.

833
00:50:10,555 --> 00:50:13,247
What does she see?
Porn everywhere.

834
00:50:13,247 --> 00:50:16,003
- She sees.
- Yes. Okay.

835
00:50:16,003 --> 00:50:17,615
It erased all of her memories.

836
00:50:17,615 --> 00:50:21,397
And now all
she remembers is porn.

837
00:50:21,397 --> 00:50:23,099
All she remembers is porn.

838
00:50:23,099 --> 00:50:25,777
Sorry, kids.
Mommy just knows porn now.

839
00:50:25,777 --> 00:50:28,958
She can't come to your site.
Oh, cause she's on the bank,
boss.

840
00:50:28,958 --> 00:50:30,936
Oh, my God.

841
00:50:31,631 --> 00:50:34,142
Okay, here's another tip.

842
00:50:34,142 --> 00:50:36,771
Do you not have your picture
taken?

843
00:50:36,771 --> 00:50:38,642
Don't
have your picture taken? Why?

844
00:50:38,642 --> 00:50:39,943
So

845
00:50:39,943 --> 00:50:43,162
I read a
post about a woman about my age.

846
00:50:43,162 --> 00:50:46,915
Beautiful mother of four.
Mixed.

847
00:50:46,915 --> 00:50:51,429
- It took me to say that.
- Well, I want to.

848
00:50:51,992 --> 00:50:56,184
She had just gotten out of
a fabulous matinee of Mamma mia!

849
00:50:56,184 --> 00:50:58,748
When this man offered
to take her photo.

850
00:50:58,748 --> 00:51:00,846
He takes out his camera, clicks
it, boom.

851
00:51:00,846 --> 00:51:05,197
She passes out, wakes up in Abu
Dhabi, chained to a bed.

852
00:51:05,197 --> 00:51:07,912
No way, no way.

853
00:51:07,912 --> 00:51:12,872
Sorry kids.
Mommy's last name is.
I'm dual now.

854
00:51:12,872 --> 00:51:15,549
- They come down.
- Okay. What?

855
00:51:15,549 --> 00:51:18,749
Just put down your bag.
No one is trying to
take your money.

856
00:51:18,749 --> 00:51:22,251
Oh, yeah?
Like I would keep money
in my bag in New York. Right?

857
00:51:22,251 --> 00:51:24,657
Well,
where do you keep it?

858
00:51:24,657 --> 00:51:26,906
In my butt?

859
00:51:26,906 --> 00:51:29,753
You keep money in your butt?
Seriously?

860
00:51:29,753 --> 00:51:33,433
Oh, yeah.
I have 2000 cash plus my jewelry

861
00:51:33,434 --> 00:51:36,190
plus tickets

862
00:51:36,781 --> 00:51:40,314
- Are Lion King tickets online?
- I'm calling.
You should know that.

863
00:51:40,314 --> 00:51:43,923
So I write a post about a woman
my age.

864
00:51:43,923 --> 00:51:45,286
Same shirt she was.

865
00:51:45,286 --> 00:51:48,054
What was. Mona? No. No.

866
00:51:48,054 --> 00:51:49,905
Go on for not doing it,

867
00:51:49,905 --> 00:51:51,042
Diane.
Everyone.

868
00:51:51,042 --> 00:51:53,111
Poke

869
00:51:53,111 --> 00:51:56,663
What was the weekend
update on college?
Yes, I'm Michael J tonight.

870
00:51:56,663 --> 00:52:00,938
Knicks in five

871
00:52:11,931 --> 00:52:14,768
Look, kids were at the
deathly diner

872
00:52:14,768 --> 00:52:18,071
because this part of the park
is for a themed, fun ride.

873
00:52:18,071 --> 00:52:21,074
It's so fun.
I love. Scary stuff.

874
00:52:21,074 --> 00:52:23,610
Rides were great today,
but I'm ready to eat.

875
00:52:23,610 --> 00:52:25,712
Greetings, diners.

876
00:52:25,712 --> 00:52:29,749
Is this your first time
dining with us this afternoon?

877
00:52:29,749 --> 00:52:31,317
I hope you enjoy your meal.

878
00:52:31,317 --> 00:52:34,888
It might be your last. Ooh.

879
00:52:34,888 --> 00:52:36,256
Kids. You scared?

880
00:52:36,256 --> 00:52:38,892
I am. Fun. Right, guys?

881
00:52:38,892 --> 00:52:41,327
We're looking for a table
for four. Right this way.

882
00:52:41,327 --> 00:52:42,729
But watch your step.

883
00:52:42,729 --> 00:52:46,966
There is blood on the floor.

884
00:52:46,966 --> 00:52:49,102
Enjoy your meal.

885
00:52:49,102 --> 00:52:52,138
It's might be your last.

886
00:52:52,138 --> 00:52:55,508
Yes. You said that.

887
00:52:58,545 --> 00:53:02,282
Fun kid.

888
00:53:02,282 --> 00:53:03,883
Fun. Right, kids?

889
00:53:03,883 --> 00:53:05,819
Hello, diners.

890
00:53:05,819 --> 00:53:09,322
I'll be your evil server
tonight.

891
00:53:09,322 --> 00:53:11,391
I'll be back to take your order.

892
00:53:11,391 --> 00:53:13,059
But be careful.

893
00:53:13,059 --> 00:53:16,429
It might be your last.

894
00:53:18,465 --> 00:53:19,299
Honey, does.

895
00:53:19,299 --> 00:53:21,634
The staff is sort of bad
at this.

896
00:53:21,634 --> 00:53:22,936
Sort of.

897
00:53:22,936 --> 00:53:26,373
I feel like
there should be more of a story.

898
00:53:26,373 --> 00:53:28,641
But the theme park
did just open this week,

899
00:53:28,641 --> 00:53:31,111
so maybe
they're still ironing it out.

900
00:53:31,111 --> 00:53:35,415
I've got two waters for you.

901
00:53:35,415 --> 00:53:38,084
But be careful.

902
00:53:38,084 --> 00:53:41,821
They might be
your last

903
00:53:41,821 --> 00:53:43,256
Do we not get more water?

904
00:53:43,256 --> 00:53:45,225
No. You do.

905
00:53:45,225 --> 00:53:48,094
But enjoy it and be careful.

906
00:53:48,094 --> 00:53:50,363
It may be your last

907
00:53:50,363 --> 00:53:51,531
drink.

908
00:53:51,531 --> 00:53:56,503
You guys have said
it might be our last a lot. Now.

909
00:53:56,503 --> 00:53:57,337
Oh, wait wait wait.

910
00:53:57,337 --> 00:53:57,871
Wait wait wait.

911
00:53:57,871 --> 00:53:58,705
Actually.

912
00:53:59,105 --> 00:54:01,641
We'd love to hear more of the
story of your scary restaurant.

913
00:54:01,641 --> 00:54:03,443
Is the theme of this place
just dying?

914
00:54:03,443 --> 00:54:05,045
No, no.

915
00:54:05,045 --> 00:54:08,181
It's also.

916
00:54:08,181 --> 00:54:11,084
Can't think of what to say.

917
00:54:11,084 --> 00:54:12,419
Dan. Dan?

918
00:54:12,419 --> 00:54:13,953
Yes, yes.

919
00:54:13,953 --> 00:54:16,690
Tell these corpses

920
00:54:16,690 --> 00:54:21,127
the scary back story
that I can't quite remember.

921
00:54:21,127 --> 00:54:26,833
Well, right now
there's, witch in our basement.

922
00:54:26,833 --> 00:54:30,103
And, vampire in our attic.

923
00:54:30,103 --> 00:54:30,937
Okay.

924
00:54:31,237 --> 00:54:34,908
And, there's a woman being
slapped around in our kitchen.

925
00:54:34,908 --> 00:54:36,743
Excuse.

926
00:54:36,743 --> 00:54:39,145
No no no no no no no
no, not like that.

927
00:54:39,145 --> 00:54:44,451
What that means is
she is getting hurt physically.

928
00:54:44,451 --> 00:54:46,786
But don't
worry, she's turned on by it.

929
00:54:46,786 --> 00:54:47,754
It was her idea.

930
00:54:47,754 --> 00:54:50,090
Okay, okay. Stop.

931
00:54:50,090 --> 00:54:52,425
Our kids are ten and 12.

932
00:54:52,425 --> 00:54:52,892
You know what?

933
00:54:53,293 --> 00:54:55,095
I'm just going to get
the bloody steak.

934
00:54:55,095 --> 00:54:57,297
But can I sub the salad
for fries?

935
00:54:57,297 --> 00:55:00,133
Yes, but be careful.

936
00:55:00,133 --> 00:55:03,336
It cost $2 extra.

937
00:55:03,336 --> 00:55:04,838
And I'll have the chicken.

938
00:55:04,838 --> 00:55:06,573
Terry. Scary. What?

939
00:55:06,573 --> 00:55:08,041
Why wouldn't
you just call it the chicken?

940
00:55:08,041 --> 00:55:10,043
Scary-aki

941
00:55:10,043 --> 00:55:14,414
Because we didn't think of that.

942
00:55:14,414 --> 00:55:16,616
It's our first day.

943
00:55:16,616 --> 00:55:19,819
Oh, and it might be our last.

944
00:55:19,819 --> 00:55:21,688
Okay, so it's your first day.

945
00:55:21,688 --> 00:55:23,723
All right, well,
that explains a lot. Yes.

946
00:55:23,723 --> 00:55:27,527
The rest of the staff
was poisoned.

947
00:55:27,527 --> 00:55:28,528
Wait, is that real?

948
00:55:28,528 --> 00:55:29,396
By the food?

949
00:55:29,396 --> 00:55:32,365
