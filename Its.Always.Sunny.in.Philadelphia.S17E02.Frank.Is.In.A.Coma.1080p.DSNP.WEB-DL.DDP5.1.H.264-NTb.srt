1
00:00:07,257 --> 00:00:09,467
<i>- How cool is that?
- That's what I'm saying.</i>

2
00:00:09,468 --> 00:00:11,552
<i>The attention to detail is remarkable.</i>

3
00:00:11,553 --> 00:00:13,971
- It's all about the presentation.
- What's it made out of?

4
00:00:13,972 --> 00:00:17,600
I don't know. The usual.
Like eggs, butter, flour.

5
00:00:17,601 --> 00:00:19,268
- Shit, really?
- No...

6
00:00:19,269 --> 00:00:21,187
Oh, it tastes like cardboard.

7
00:00:21,188 --> 00:00:23,189
Hold on a second.
What is everybody talking about?

8
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:24,524
This show. It's amazing.

9
00:00:24,525 --> 00:00:30,696
They get genius bakers to disguise cake
as ordinary objects. It's nuts.

10
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:32,323
Nobody gives a shit about cake, Frank.

11
00:00:32,324 --> 00:00:33,866
We're talking about
this elegant invitation

12
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:36,202
- to the Ben Franklin Liberty Ball.
- Where'd you get that?

13
00:00:36,203 --> 00:00:38,287
- I threw it in the dumpster.
- That's exactly where I got it.

14
00:00:38,288 --> 00:00:39,997
- Oh.
- Hang on.

15
00:00:39,998 --> 00:00:42,875
You going in the dumpsters these days?
That's kinda my turf, no?

16
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:43,960
I know, and I'm really sorry.

17
00:00:43,961 --> 00:00:45,836
- It's not so bad in there.
- Digging for loose change...

18
00:00:45,837 --> 00:00:47,505
- You find some treasures.
- Find stuff like this.

19
00:00:47,506 --> 00:00:49,298
- See what I'm saying?
- Therein lies the problem.

20
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:51,133
We're rooting around in trash
for opportunities

21
00:00:51,134 --> 00:00:52,760
when we should be attending elite galas.

22
00:00:52,761 --> 00:00:55,137
Ah, those galas are a waste of time.

23
00:00:55,138 --> 00:00:58,557
I mean, a bunch of rich assholes
dressed to the nines,

24
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:02,853
eating great food, talking
about multimillion-dollar business deals.

25
00:01:02,854 --> 00:01:04,689
- That sounds awesome.
- That sounds really fun.

26
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:08,192
The exact kind of thing we brought you
into our operation years ago for, Frank.

27
00:01:08,193 --> 00:01:10,236
To do stuff like that to elevate us,

28
00:01:10,237 --> 00:01:14,365
not to drag us down by having
conversations about what is or isn't cake.

29
00:01:14,366 --> 00:01:15,449
- Right?
- Making a good point.

30
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:17,577
The cake is the whole thing.

31
00:01:17,578 --> 00:01:21,706
You think we can't figure out what is
or is not cake, Frank? That's so stupid.

32
00:01:21,707 --> 00:01:24,333
- What are we talking about?
- You just don't get it.

33
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:26,961
Why can't you just die
and leave us your money, you know?

34
00:01:26,962 --> 00:01:29,880
Like every normal human being, so I don't
have to root around in the dumpsters.

35
00:01:29,881 --> 00:01:31,841
- You don't mean that.
- I absolutely do mean it.

36
00:01:31,842 --> 00:01:33,175
- In fact, you know what?
- Good.

37
00:01:33,176 --> 00:01:35,094
What you hiding in your pockets?
Any change in there?

38
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:36,971
- Get out of here. Get away.
- No. Give me your...

39
00:01:36,972 --> 00:01:39,056
- Dee, tickle him.
- Don't. Don't, don't, don't!

40
00:01:39,057 --> 00:01:40,474
- Yeah, yeah. Tickle him.
- Yeah.

41
00:01:40,475 --> 00:01:42,810
Back off, bitch.

42
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:45,062
- I don't like it. It hurts.
- You don't like it?

43
00:01:45,063 --> 00:01:46,856
Oh, yeah? If it hurts, why you laughing?

44
00:01:52,571 --> 00:01:54,406
Frank, knock it off. What are you doing?

45
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:01,788
Is he good?

46
00:02:03,176 --> 00:02:05,883
COMA

47
00:02:26,938 --> 00:02:29,982
{\an8}All right, guys, let's not worry,
all right? This guy's tough as nails.

48
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:32,318
{\an8}I've seen him go into a coma,
like, every single night,

49
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:34,195
{\an8}and he always pops right up
in the morning.

50
00:02:34,196 --> 00:02:35,446
{\an8}Well, that's just sleep.

51
00:02:35,447 --> 00:02:36,947
- Are you sure?
- You're describing sleep.

52
00:02:36,948 --> 00:02:39,450
- You've seen him sleep.
- Okay, what's the difference?

53
00:02:39,451 --> 00:02:43,287
Either way, listen,
I think our organization
is at a bit of a crossroads now.

54
00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:46,999
I mean, this man was our de facto leader,
now he's literal dead weight.

55
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,501
It's not like we could just, you know,

56
00:02:48,502 --> 00:02:50,378
wheel him around
and plug him in wherever we go.

57
00:02:50,379 --> 00:02:52,672
No, we could. We just get a big battery
or something,

58
00:02:52,673 --> 00:02:54,298
- like a Tesla battery.
- No. That's so stupid.

59
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:56,592
They don't make batteries that big.
Gonna have to get a generator.

60
00:02:56,593 --> 00:02:59,261
- And spend all our money on gas?
- Oh, right, right.

61
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:01,389
But either way,
that's not the point I'm trying to make.

62
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:05,893
What I'm saying is even if he does live,
I think we need to move on from this man.

63
00:03:05,894 --> 00:03:08,729
Okay, well, look,
why don't we just let the lady finish,

64
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:10,481
and then we devise a plan. Sound good?

65
00:03:10,482 --> 00:03:12,525
- Yeah, that's the right thing to do.
- Sure. Yeah. Okay.

66
00:03:12,526 --> 00:03:14,069
Sorry. You were saying?

67
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:16,737
Yes, like I say,

68
00:03:16,738 --> 00:03:19,865
Frank requests to convalesce here
instead of hospital.

69
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:21,200
- Obviously it's happening...
- Clearly.

70
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:22,993
One of you is Deandra?

71
00:03:22,994 --> 00:03:24,954
Yeah, that's me. What'd I win?

72
00:03:24,955 --> 00:03:28,541
In event that his heart rate
drops below 50 beats per minute,

73
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:30,835
you will remove life support

74
00:03:30,836 --> 00:03:33,379
- and facilitate death.
- Why me?

75
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:34,880
Maybe because
you tickled the man to death.

76
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:36,215
- Yeah.
- You think it was the tickling

77
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:38,175
- and not the decades of whores and drugs...
- I don't know.

78
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:40,886
- and living under sewers and bridges?
- Where's the expression come from then?

79
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:43,180
"Tickle a man to death."
Like, "tickled to death." That's a thing.

80
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:46,434
- Dee, it's the man's dying wish.
- Yeah.

81
00:03:46,435 --> 00:03:49,770
Perhaps you're all experiencing
stages of grief.

82
00:03:49,771 --> 00:03:54,275
First is denial, then anger, bargaining,

83
00:03:54,276 --> 00:03:56,944
depression, and acceptance.

84
00:03:56,945 --> 00:04:00,030
Is it lecture time?
I didn't realize I was back in school.

85
00:04:00,031 --> 00:04:02,366
Professor Doctor over here. Yeah.

86
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:04,869
- I deny what you're saying, by the way.
- Absolutely. It's not that.

87
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:06,620
- Yeah, let's roll.
- No, no, no. Where you going?

88
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:09,123
We'll come back. We were gonna go
to Paddy's and grab some supplies.

89
00:04:09,124 --> 00:04:11,709
Yeah. We'll go to Paddy's.
We'll get some beers and some more chairs.

90
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:13,210
Uh-huh. What's wrong with the chairs?

91
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:16,548
Well, there aren't chairs.
There's a chair, and it's covered in wax.

92
00:04:17,174 --> 00:04:19,758
- I believe that's cheese.
- I don't want to sit in cheese either.

93
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,845
Fine, have it your way.
We'll get cheeseless chairs.

94
00:04:22,846 --> 00:04:26,892
- Get beers and come right back.
- Dee. We'll be right back.

95
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:32,188
Hey, just to be clear,
we're going to that gala, right?

96
00:04:32,189 --> 00:04:33,981
- That's exactly where we're going.
- Absolutely.

97
00:04:33,982 --> 00:04:36,484
I just figured in the interest
of streamlining things, we cut Dee loose.

98
00:04:36,485 --> 00:04:38,152
- I think that's right.
- Does that feel right?

99
00:04:38,153 --> 00:04:40,696
We can't have her there.
It's not gonna be a good look for us.

100
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:44,241
You know, guys, Frank's situation's
got me reflecting on, like, where we are,

101
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:47,661
and I'm afraid we've drifted a little
too far off track from our original goal.

102
00:04:47,662 --> 00:04:49,538
I mean, I don't know if you recall,

103
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:51,332
but we were never supposed
to own only one bar.

104
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:54,293
No, Paddy's was always supposed to be,
like, a global brand, you know?

105
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:56,045
Yeah. Like a Starbucks for dive bars.

106
00:04:56,046 --> 00:05:00,257
Exactly, yes, but bringing your friendly
neighborhood watering hole to everybody.

107
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:02,510
Everywhere, right?
A Paddy's on every corner, right?

108
00:05:02,511 --> 00:05:06,514
- Airports, shopping malls, drive-throughs.
- Yeah, schools, churches, like, little--

109
00:05:06,515 --> 00:05:08,557
- Hundred percent.
- What went wrong? Like, what went...

110
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:10,601
- When Dee got involved.
- Yes.

111
00:05:10,602 --> 00:05:12,561
And women ruin everything, we know that.

112
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:15,397
- This woman does. Then Frank got involved.
- All women, kind of. And then Frank.

113
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:17,817
I can't totally deny that.
I mean, the stats are there, right?

114
00:05:17,818 --> 00:05:19,568
- The stats are there.
- We got distracted.

115
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:21,403
It was like dude, dude, dude,
dude, woman. Right?

116
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:22,988
- Let's get back on track, okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

117
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:25,741
Look, this gala
is the perfect opportunity for us--

118
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:28,077
It's gonna be jam-packed
with wealthy benefactors

119
00:05:28,078 --> 00:05:31,413
who are champing at the bit
to strap themselves to our rocket ship.

120
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:33,958
Yeah. Please, like,
let's not worry about Frank.

121
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:36,627
Trust me, he's gonna be totally fine.

122
00:05:36,628 --> 00:05:38,262
Denial

123
00:05:43,802 --> 00:05:45,136
God, I hate this.

124
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:48,223
How long is it gonna to take
for him to kick the bucket?

125
00:05:49,307 --> 00:05:51,351
E-everyone is different.

126
00:05:52,102 --> 00:05:54,520
No, I get that,
but it's like days or weeks?

127
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:57,983
You know, studies suggest
that coma patients can hear.

128
00:05:58,942 --> 00:06:01,527
Perhaps you speak with Frank.

129
00:06:01,528 --> 00:06:03,863
Oh, no, no. I'm good.

130
00:06:03,864 --> 00:06:06,532
I didn't really love talking to the guy
when he was alive, you know?

131
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:08,826
- He's still alive.
- Oh...

132
00:06:08,827 --> 00:06:10,786
You know what I mean. I just...

133
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:13,205
I don't like him.
It's time to cut him loose.

134
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:14,832
This is happening at a good time for me.

135
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:17,585
It's natural to be in denial.

136
00:06:17,586 --> 00:06:19,086
Oh, my God. Here you go again.

137
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:22,131
Lady, I'm not in denial.
I just don't care about Frank.

138
00:06:22,132 --> 00:06:25,342
Which I... I can hear it
when it comes out of my mouth.

139
00:06:25,343 --> 00:06:28,095
That sounds like I-I'm in denial,
but y-you know what you're doing?

140
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:29,430
You're painting me into a corner.

141
00:06:29,431 --> 00:06:31,473
You're boxing me out
and leaving me with nothing to say

142
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:33,977
that doesn't sound like I'm in denial.
I have no way to win this fight.

143
00:06:34,936 --> 00:06:38,106
Hey, does it say anything in those files
about what kind of action I'm getting?

144
00:06:39,024 --> 00:06:43,110
- I do not understand.
- Inheritance. Gotta get my money.

145
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:44,904
Headed down to South America.

146
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:47,324
Gonna get some cosmetic surgery done
on the cheap.

147
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:49,575
I won't go into too much detail,

148
00:06:49,576 --> 00:06:53,830
but let's just say I'll probably need
two seats on the flight back.

149
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:56,499
I'm getting my ass done.

150
00:06:57,667 --> 00:07:00,044
Ooh. I might get a foot reduction
while I'm down there too.

151
00:07:00,045 --> 00:07:01,879
Although, you know what?
That's not a good idea.

152
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:04,507
No, I'm gonna need these feet
to carry that big fat ass around.

153
00:07:09,012 --> 00:07:12,806
- Look at the chandeliers.
- Wow, this is such a fancy gala.

154
00:07:12,807 --> 00:07:15,560
I'm not seeing a lot of tuxes,
I gotta say. But you know what?

155
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:19,104
I think we'll just tell people
that we came from an even fancier gala.

156
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:20,314
- Yeah.
- Right?

157
00:07:20,315 --> 00:07:22,191
- That'll make us look cool. Okay.
- It will.

158
00:07:22,192 --> 00:07:27,237
Now, I'm thinking that table right there,
that's where we make our move.

159
00:07:28,323 --> 00:07:30,741
- Those guys look intense.
- Those are heavy hitters.

160
00:07:30,742 --> 00:07:34,245
I got an angle. Okay. We go in there.
We say that we're the Smuckers brothers.

161
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:36,914
Why?

162
00:07:36,915 --> 00:07:38,415
Well, we're, like, the Smuckers brothers.

163
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:42,127
We're purveyors of fine jellies
and jams from the Deep South.

164
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:44,004
How does that get us closer to the goal?

165
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:46,757
They're gonna be
impressed with some jelly magnates.

166
00:07:46,758 --> 00:07:48,967
- I think that you are confusing...
- Magnates?

167
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:50,969
...the Smuckers brothers
with the Smothers Brothers

168
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:53,097
who were a folk singing duo from the '50s.

169
00:07:53,098 --> 00:07:55,182
- Shit. Yeah.
- And they were, I think, Canadian.

170
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:56,975
Stop. What are we talking about?

171
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:59,687
None of that gets us closer to the goal
of franchising Paddy's.

172
00:07:59,688 --> 00:08:01,689
Well, we just want
to make a good impression, you know?

173
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:03,775
Yeah, yeah, like...
And so who are we playing?

174
00:08:04,526 --> 00:08:05,735
We'll just be ourselves.

175
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:09,238
- I don't feel comfortable playing myself.
- We haven't done that in ages, man.

176
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:12,157
Guys, don't do this to yourselves, okay?
Listen, we belong here, right?

177
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:15,577
We're not asking for a handout.
We're not asking these people for favors.

178
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:17,871
Hell, we're doing them a favor
by giving them the opportunity

179
00:08:17,872 --> 00:08:20,457
to get in on the ground floor
of a cultural juggernaut.

180
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:21,542
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

181
00:08:21,543 --> 00:08:23,460
And if they even hesitate,
boom, offer rescinded.

182
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:24,586
- Yeah, yeah. Yeah.
- Okay?

183
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:26,422
We are young self-made entrepreneurs

184
00:08:26,423 --> 00:08:28,841
who are about to change the way
the world consumes alcohol.

185
00:08:28,842 --> 00:08:29,967
- Oh, yeah, dude.
- Yeah.

186
00:08:29,968 --> 00:08:31,468
- That's getting me fired up, man.
- Yeah!

187
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:33,053
I feel like
I could run through a brick wall.

188
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:34,680
- Hell yeah.
- Do it right now. Do it right now.

189
00:08:34,681 --> 00:08:37,725
Wait, wait, wait, wait. Hold on.
Don't actually run through a brick wall.

190
00:08:37,726 --> 00:08:39,017
I wanted to impress Charlie.

191
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:41,103
- They're not brick. These will knock down.
- Listen.

192
00:08:41,104 --> 00:08:43,814
Do carry that feeling with you. Okay?
I like the confidence.

193
00:08:43,815 --> 00:08:48,360
So pop your chins up,
puff your chests out and follow my lead.

194
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:51,614
- Let's do it.
- That's a... That's a little much. Just...

195
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:55,868
Less stiff. Just... All right,
forget the chin and chest thing.

196
00:08:55,869 --> 00:08:57,120
- Just...
- Okay.

197
00:08:57,954 --> 00:09:00,205
I don't... I can't forget it though
'cause he said it.

198
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:03,208
Well, how we doing over here, fellas?

199
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:06,546
Oh, great. Um, and we'll...
we'll do another bottle.

200
00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:10,632
- Uh, uh... Yep.
- Good. Yeah.

201
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:13,594
Also, we're ready for dessert,
so we can clear all this.

202
00:09:13,595 --> 00:09:15,387
- Right away, sir. Yes.
- Uh-huh. Yeah, of course.

203
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:16,700
ANGER

204
00:09:18,475 --> 00:09:22,562
Oh, God, this is boring. I'm so bored.

205
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:26,356
I could go for a beer. You want a beer?
Know what? I'll check in with the guys.

206
00:09:26,357 --> 00:09:29,568
Mikey, they hate these Chardonnays.
I need something nicer.

207
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:31,945
Hello?

208
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:34,782
Hey, Charlie. It's Dee.
What's going on with those beers?

209
00:09:34,783 --> 00:09:37,910
Oh. I kinda can't talk right now, Dee.

210
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:40,413
- Where are you?
- At Paddy's.

211
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:42,539
You sound like you're on the Titanic.

212
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:45,334
I'm gonna need a double scotch
and a club and Campari...

213
00:09:45,335 --> 00:09:48,003
- I got Dee. Wants to know where we are.
- Don't tell her about the gala.

214
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:50,089
- I'm not gonna tell her about the gala.
- Hang up.

215
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:51,882
- I can hear you.
- I think she can hear us.

216
00:09:51,883 --> 00:09:53,550
- I can!
- Course she can hear us.

217
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:56,178
- Tell her I ran through a brick wall.
- That was my invitation.

218
00:09:56,179 --> 00:09:58,347
Dee, I gotta hang up on you,
but Mac ran through a brick wall.

219
00:09:58,348 --> 00:10:00,224
<i>That's actually
why we're not back at the place yet.</i>

220
00:10:00,225 --> 00:10:01,809
Tell her both of us
ran through a brick wall.

221
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:03,644
Dennis also ran through the wall,
and I did too.

222
00:10:03,645 --> 00:10:05,312
- Okay. Yeah.
- You son of a bitch.

223
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:09,650
Dee, I can't talk right now, all right?
We're working at the gala.

224
00:10:09,651 --> 00:10:12,986
No. No, no, no!
You don't hang up on me! You...

225
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:14,905
What are you looking at?

226
00:10:14,906 --> 00:10:17,324
Let me guess, did I enter the anger phase?

227
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:18,700
You do seem angry.

228
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:20,744
Yeah, I'm angry!
But it's got nothing to do with Frank.

229
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:23,914
It's about the dick bags. They think they
can just cut me out. Well, you know what?

230
00:10:23,915 --> 00:10:26,458
I-I'm gonna cut them out.
I'm gonna cut them out.

231
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:29,378
There's gotta be something valuable
around here. It's gotta be here somewhere.

232
00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:30,587
You know what I mean?

233
00:10:30,588 --> 00:10:32,548
Oh, those sons of bitches. I'll show...

234
00:10:35,093 --> 00:10:38,637
Five bucks! Five bucks I found!

235
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:41,807
All right. Listen, listen.
We need to regroup.

236
00:10:41,808 --> 00:10:43,809
Okay? This whole thing's
gone off the rails.

237
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:46,353
We gotta do it quick 'cause I told
some guys I'd pull their car around.

238
00:10:46,354 --> 00:10:47,896
I gotta get their coats before they go,

239
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:49,481
- but then...
- Guys, we do not work here.

240
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:52,526
- Could you hand me a towel, please?
- Yes, sir. Of course, sir.

241
00:10:52,527 --> 00:10:54,987
- Give a towel.
- Yeah, well.

242
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:56,071
- Thank you.
- I know.

243
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:58,490
You know what I'm saying?
Otherwise we're gonna...

244
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:00,325
- Thank you, sir. Have a good night.
- Thank you, sir.

245
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:03,412
Okay, we're not...
Why does everyone think we're employees?

246
00:11:03,413 --> 00:11:06,874
It could be the tuxes or that we're doing
everything that everybody asks of us.

247
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:09,293
The tuxes definitely make us
look like bathroom attendants.

248
00:11:09,294 --> 00:11:10,502
You know what? I blame Frank.

249
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:12,462
He did not give us the tools
to survive in this world.

250
00:11:12,463 --> 00:11:13,881
- We look like fools.
- A hundred percent.

251
00:11:13,882 --> 00:11:15,507
A hundred percent.
Like he locked us in a zoo

252
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:18,218
and then now he's released us out
into the Serengeti to be devoured.

253
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:20,470
- We're sitting ducks out here.
- We don't know what we're doing.

254
00:11:20,471 --> 00:11:22,431
If he weren't already in a coma,
I would strangle him.

255
00:11:22,432 --> 00:11:24,099
- It's his fault.
- Hey, fellas.

256
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:26,018
Sorry, I couldn't help
but overhear the conversation.

257
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:29,771
I really, really hope
that your father dies.

258
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:31,274
- Wha... Excuse me?
- Huh?

259
00:11:31,858 --> 00:11:34,860
Frank, that's your dad, right?
You said he was in a coma.

260
00:11:34,861 --> 00:11:37,696
- Yeah.
- Yeah. I really, really hope he dies.

261
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:38,989
He sounds just like my dad.

262
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:41,491
He just like craps on all your ideas,
doesn't believe in you,

263
00:11:41,492 --> 00:11:42,577
doesn't hug you.

264
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:45,621
- Oh. Sorry to hear that about your dad.
- Oh.

265
00:11:45,622 --> 00:11:47,372
No, are you... No, don't sweat it.

266
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:50,042
He's in a box under the ground
right now. He's dead.

267
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:52,628
Which is fucking awesome
'cause I run his company.

268
00:11:52,629 --> 00:11:54,213
- Oh, shit.
- Wow!

269
00:11:54,214 --> 00:11:57,466
- That is awesome!
- Yeah! Who's the idiot now, bitch?

270
00:11:57,467 --> 00:11:59,509
- He's dead.
- He's a dead idiot.

271
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:01,428
- Nice, dude.
- Oh, my God. Cool.

272
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:04,097
What kinda company do you run?
Like, what do you do?

273
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:05,557
I'm, like, your typical capitalist pig.

274
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:08,352
I dismantle companies,
sell the scraps for a marginal profit.

275
00:12:08,353 --> 00:12:09,728
- That sorta thing.
- Sick!

276
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:11,939
- Bet you make a lot of money?
- I'm a piece of shit.

277
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:14,399
- That's us!
- We are too. We are too.

278
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,777
- You guys are cool. I'm Simon, by the way.
- Uh...

279
00:12:16,778 --> 00:12:18,278
No, no, I wasn't taking a shit.

280
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:20,489
- I was just... I was doing cocaine.
- Oh.

281
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:22,908
Do you guys want to do
a bump of cocaine with me?

282
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:24,576
- Yes.
- Sure. Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

283
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:26,411
- Yeah! Let's do it!
- Yeah. We'll do it. Yeah.

284
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:28,330
- One for me.
- Uh-huh.

285
00:12:28,331 --> 00:12:31,376
And one for me.

286
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:33,460
- That's awesome.
- He's good at it.

287
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:35,254
Hey, guys, I was gonna
go to this after-party

288
00:12:35,255 --> 00:12:37,506
- if you guys wanna tag along with me.
- There's an after-party?

289
00:12:37,507 --> 00:12:40,342
I mean, it's probably gonna be bullshit,
but we can talk business.

290
00:12:40,343 --> 00:12:42,844
You guys can... We can bounce
some ideas around, see if anything sticks.

291
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:45,180
- Yeah, that'd be great.
- It'd be really cool to collab.

292
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:48,225
- Yeah. Oh, yeah.
- Wouldn't it be cool to collab?

293
00:12:48,226 --> 00:12:49,685
Are you guys open to collabing?

294
00:12:49,686 --> 00:12:51,103
- Yeah.
- Let's collab.

295
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:54,147
I'm gonna tell my driver to pull around,
and we'll get this going.

296
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:56,233
- We'll give our guy the night off.
- Okay, amazing.

297
00:12:56,234 --> 00:12:58,735
Give me back my cocaine.
Give it back right now!

298
00:12:58,736 --> 00:13:02,030
I like you guys. You're real people.
You're human beings.

299
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:04,408
You're not like
these soulless reptiles over here.

300
00:13:04,409 --> 00:13:06,702
- Yeah. Yeah.
- They're disgusting. Come on. Let's roll.

301
00:13:06,703 --> 00:13:08,829
Did you hear what he said,
"soulless reptiles"? Pizzagate!

302
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:09,997
- No, no.
- Yeah. They're lizards!

303
00:13:09,998 --> 00:13:12,249
- No conspiracy theories. Don't ruin this.
- He's right.

304
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:14,584
- This is a good business opportunity.
- Oh, God, that's good coke.

305
00:13:14,585 --> 00:13:16,753
That was good cocaine.
That's rich guy cocaine.

306
00:13:16,754 --> 00:13:18,483
Bargaining

307
00:13:19,549 --> 00:13:24,345
There we go. There we go.

308
00:13:25,096 --> 00:13:28,432
Okay, a severed gas handle. No.

309
00:13:28,433 --> 00:13:30,434
Let's see. What is that? Ooh.

310
00:13:30,435 --> 00:13:33,021
Gold tooth. Pop that in the keeper pile.

311
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:35,978
My most

312
00:13:35,978 --> 00:13:37,859
Uh... This looks promising.

313
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:43,448
<i>BigAssButts ? 1973? Goddamn it!</i>

314
00:13:45,116 --> 00:13:46,825
Where is it, you son of a bitch?
Where is it?

315
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:50,495
Where's the gold and-and the-the jewels
and millions of dollars?

316
00:13:53,124 --> 00:13:55,667
I have a fun idea.
Let's pull the plug now, okay?

317
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:57,878
- It'll just be our little secret.
- I cannot do this.

318
00:13:57,879 --> 00:14:00,005
You don't have to do anything.
Just go take a potty break

319
00:14:00,006 --> 00:14:01,882
and I'll just trip over the plug.

320
00:14:01,883 --> 00:14:03,800
No, no, this is murder you describe.

321
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:07,929
Oh, God, don't be a prude. Okay, listen.
I'll make it worth your while.

322
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:09,973
My ass doesn't have to be that big, right?

323
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:14,311
I'll kick you a few CCs, and then you
and me will take our brand-new dumpers

324
00:14:14,312 --> 00:14:17,397
and we'll just go, you know,
flaunting around Copacabana Beach.

325
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:18,941
- What do you say?
- I must say no.

326
00:14:20,818 --> 00:14:23,695
And I must say, screw you!
I don't need any of this.

327
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:25,947
I'm taking my inheritance,
and I'm going home.

328
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:31,079
Frank, if you can hear me, I'm taking
your big butt magazine! It's mine now!

329
00:14:32,747 --> 00:14:36,708
- This is a much cooler vibe in here, man.
- This is a great vibe.

330
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:38,585
- You guys discussing the vibe?
- It's classy, right?

331
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:41,463
It's freaking amazing, right?
And people are very cool here.

332
00:14:41,464 --> 00:14:42,756
I am a little concerned about Frank.

333
00:14:42,757 --> 00:14:44,508
At some point,
we should probably check in.

334
00:14:44,509 --> 00:14:46,551
You said everything
was gonna be fine with Frank.

335
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:47,803
I know, but it's getting late.

336
00:14:47,804 --> 00:14:50,013
I'll tell you what,
let's stay here for another hour or so,

337
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:52,432
see what we can get going.
And then if you're still concerned,

338
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:55,310
- we can split and check in on him.
- Yo!

339
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:57,854
- Got some more genius powder, boys.
- Wow! Nice!

340
00:14:57,855 --> 00:14:59,147
- Get your fucking hands out.
- Okay!

341
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:01,399
- Get your hands... Get your hands out.
- Out in the open?

342
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,568
- This is my fucking party!
- This is your party? Okay.

343
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:05,112
- Okay. Your rules, man.
- Okay!

344
00:15:05,113 --> 00:15:06,530
Do it up, boys!

345
00:15:08,491 --> 00:15:11,076
That burns.
That's very different from the last coke.

346
00:15:11,077 --> 00:15:14,121
Man. You got a sophisticated palette.
I love that, bro.

347
00:15:14,122 --> 00:15:17,165
Yeah, it burns 'cause it's different.
It's not coke. Ow!

348
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:18,250
- What is it?
- It's not coke?

349
00:15:18,251 --> 00:15:19,751
- It's crystal.
- It's what?

350
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:21,795
- Crystal meth?
- Yeah, crystal meth.

351
00:15:21,796 --> 00:15:25,715
- Oh.
- Can you remind me
what you guys, uh, do again?

352
00:15:25,716 --> 00:15:28,343
- Uh...
- Sorry, you mean like... like our jobs?

353
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:32,180
Yeah, come on, I whipped mine out.
You gotta whip yours out.

354
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:33,515
- We're in the beverage space.
- Yeah.

355
00:15:33,516 --> 00:15:35,517
- Oh, cool. What's the company called?
- Paddy's Pub.

356
00:15:35,518 --> 00:15:37,394
- Yeah.
- Well, yeah.

357
00:15:37,395 --> 00:15:39,146
Paddy's Pub? Like a bar?

358
00:15:39,147 --> 00:15:42,107
Yeah, well... It is a bar, but
it's much more robust than it sounds.

359
00:15:42,108 --> 00:15:43,817
Yeah. We see a lot of growth potential.

360
00:15:43,818 --> 00:15:46,778
Yeah, of course you do.
Because, dude, it's global brand.

361
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:49,072
It's not just a bar.
It's fucking Starbucks.

362
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:51,324
- Oh, my God! Dude--
- Right?

363
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:52,826
- Yes!
- There's so many possibilities.

364
00:15:52,827 --> 00:15:54,661
Dude, you are in our heads right now, man.

365
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:56,079
I'm in your fucking heads!

366
00:15:56,080 --> 00:16:00,000
I don't wanna say this too loud because
we don't have room for everybody in this,

367
00:16:00,001 --> 00:16:03,879
but we're still in the early stages
of possibly bringing on some investors,

368
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:06,339
you know what I mean?
So if you're interested,

369
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:08,301
- we'd love to have you.
- Yeah, yeah, dude.

370
00:16:09,719 --> 00:16:11,219
What do you mean?

371
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,221
- Uh... We were--
- Other investors--

372
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:15,724
We're doing a friends and family round,
and we thought you'd be--

373
00:16:15,725 --> 00:16:18,143
- Yeah. It's just--
- But you literally just met me.

374
00:16:18,144 --> 00:16:20,187
- But we like you. So we thought--
- We like you.

375
00:16:20,188 --> 00:16:21,813
You like my money.

376
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:23,231
- It's not--
- You meet me in a bathroom,

377
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:26,151
you do my drugs, and then I bleed green
for you, for your fucking bar?

378
00:16:26,152 --> 00:16:28,195
- No, man.
- Shit, dude. We're really sorry.

379
00:16:28,196 --> 00:16:29,571
- No--
- We're really sorry, man.

380
00:16:29,572 --> 00:16:30,655
You--

381
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:33,950
I like you, guys! I would fucking love
to give you money.

382
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:37,662
Enough. Shut up. Wanna fucking celebrate?
Want to go to another party?

383
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:39,873
After-after-party?
It's gonna be really fun.

384
00:16:39,874 --> 00:16:41,958
- Another party after this after-party?
- Better than this?

385
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:45,003
Dude, let's do it. I'm so ready.
Let's do it, guys. I'm so excited.

386
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:46,755
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

387
00:16:46,756 --> 00:16:50,092
- Oh, my God. What's happening?
- It's all happening for us.

388
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:54,132
Depression

389
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:03,021
Might as well take a look
at what I'll never have.

390
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:04,273
Thanks a lot, Frank.

391
00:17:10,071 --> 00:17:11,072
What's this?

392
00:17:12,948 --> 00:17:14,974
LOVE

393
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:17,453
Oh, my God.

394
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:24,460
This was his most prized possession?

395
00:17:26,671 --> 00:17:31,717
<i>♪ Follow the yellow brick road, my boys ♪</i>

396
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:34,886
- This is the place, huh?
- Where are we?

397
00:17:35,972 --> 00:17:39,349
- What's the password?
- Narcan.

398
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:41,184
- Well, that's a bit unsettling.
- Narcan?

399
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:43,353
- We're in, boys.
- All right.

400
00:17:43,354 --> 00:17:45,272
- We're in.
- Isn't that what they give you

401
00:17:45,273 --> 00:17:46,565
- when you OD or something?
- Yeah.

402
00:17:49,235 --> 00:17:51,861
- Let's go, Phil.
- What's up, Simon?

403
00:17:51,862 --> 00:17:54,155
- I love you so much.
- Hi.

404
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:58,243
Oh, shit. Um, okay.

405
00:17:58,244 --> 00:17:59,911
He really likes that guy. Um...

406
00:18:01,956 --> 00:18:03,873
- I love you, Phil.
- Thank you.

407
00:18:03,874 --> 00:18:05,500
You got it for me? Great.

408
00:18:05,501 --> 00:18:08,420
That's Phil. He's a great guy.
A little annoying, but I like him.

409
00:18:08,421 --> 00:18:09,713
Come on, take a seat.

410
00:18:09,714 --> 00:18:11,172
- I'll stand.
- Do you mind if I stand?

411
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:13,925
- Make me rich. Fuck me with an idea.
- Okay. Good.

412
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:16,678
- Take an idea and fuck me with it.
- Okay, yeah. Sure--

413
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:18,221
- Right now?
- Well, we just have the...

414
00:18:18,222 --> 00:18:20,974
Don't overthink it, just fuck me.
Fuck me with an idea.

415
00:18:20,975 --> 00:18:23,226
- Yeah, it was Starbucks--
- I'm drying up.

416
00:18:23,227 --> 00:18:26,146
I just want you to spit on it
and I want you to stick it in me.

417
00:18:26,147 --> 00:18:27,355
Someone's got to fuck me.

418
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:30,734
- Can you just give us a second and--
- One second, we'll figure out which one--

419
00:18:30,735 --> 00:18:32,485
- Which idea we're gonna...
- You guys take your time.

420
00:18:32,486 --> 00:18:34,112
I'm gonna make the world stop spinning.

421
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:37,073
...gonna fuck you with and... I'm concerned--

422
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:38,908
This guy's not gonna help us
with our business.

423
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:40,785
- There's no way, right?
- His dad was right about him.

424
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:43,204
- Absolutely. Absolutely.
- Frank was right about this whole thing.

425
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:45,123
He was protecting us this whole time.
That's what it is.

426
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:46,833
That's why he doesn't invite us
to these places.

427
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:49,836
Yes, because Frank knew. He knew
that galas were gateways to crack houses.

428
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:52,464
If you just have so much and
you don't know what to do with yourself,

429
00:18:52,465 --> 00:18:53,548
you wind up like that.

430
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:56,801
Look, also, man, I'm getting worried
about him, okay?

431
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:58,845
- I wanna be there when he wakes up.
- Fuck.

432
00:18:58,846 --> 00:19:00,805
We've kind of left him alone for too long.

433
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:03,016
- Let's get out of here, 'cause I'm scared.
- You should be scared.

434
00:19:03,017 --> 00:19:05,518
- Let's say bye to Simon real quick.
- Yeah, 'cause I don't like...

435
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:06,811
- Simon, look...
- Simon, we--

436
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:11,316
- We're leaving.
- Yeah, we're gonna leave, Simon.

437
00:19:11,317 --> 00:19:13,902
- That's a very unnatural position.
- He seems fine. No, he's fine.

438
00:19:13,903 --> 00:19:16,112
Let's, um... All right. Let's just go.

439
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:17,739
- Thank you, guys.
- Thanks, everybody.

440
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:20,241
We're gonna use your driver
and then we'll send him back for you.

441
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:22,017
Acceptance

442
00:19:27,758 --> 00:19:31,170
Dad, if you can hear me in there,

443
00:19:32,963 --> 00:19:35,173
I want you to know that I love you.

444
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:36,716
- Hey.
- Hey, how's he doing?

445
00:19:36,717 --> 00:19:38,968
- Yeah, how's it going?
- He's at the end.

446
00:19:38,969 --> 00:19:40,679
It's time to say goodbye.

447
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,514
Oh, no, come on.
What are you talking about?

448
00:19:42,515 --> 00:19:45,600
- Yeah, what?
- Dee, you look actually upset.

449
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:49,270
You guys don't understand. It's time.
We gotta pull the plug.

450
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:52,816
- No. Sorry, no. He's still alive, right?
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

451
00:19:52,817 --> 00:19:56,152
- This is his wish. It's time.
- No. I'm... No. I'm saying no.

452
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:58,571
- We just realized we need him.
- Frank, we need you, man.

453
00:19:58,572 --> 00:20:00,366
- I'm not letting him go.
- Guys. You guys.

454
00:20:01,784 --> 00:20:03,411
It's over.

455
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:07,832
I love you, Dad.

456
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:11,752
I can't believe this is happening.

457
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:16,716
Tastes sweet.

458
00:20:17,508 --> 00:20:19,593
- What do you mean?
- Is he supposed to taste sweet?

459
00:20:20,928 --> 00:20:23,639
Shouldn't it be salty, if anything?

460
00:20:26,142 --> 00:20:28,894
- What is happening? What is that?
- Jesus Christ.

461
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:32,147
Cake. It's cake.

462
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:37,026
- I'm cake.
- What is happening?

463
00:20:37,027 --> 00:20:39,112
What is going on?
What are you talking about?

464
00:20:39,113 --> 00:20:43,158
I tricked you guys.
You said you could tell the difference

465
00:20:43,159 --> 00:20:46,369
between what was cake
and what was not cake,

466
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:49,831
- and you couldn't. Ha!
- What are you talking about, man?

467
00:20:49,832 --> 00:20:53,918
I commissioned a cake.
I rented all of this hospital equipment,

468
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:58,131
and I even had to draw that little stupid
drawing with you and me holding hands.

469
00:20:58,132 --> 00:21:00,383
"I love Daddy. I love you, Daddy."

470
00:21:00,384 --> 00:21:02,886
Why? Why would you do all that?

471
00:21:02,887 --> 00:21:04,554
Hang on, time out. Who's this woman?

472
00:21:04,555 --> 00:21:07,474
She's a pastry chef
and a goddamn good one.

473
00:21:07,475 --> 00:21:09,267
- You doing all right?
- My God.

474
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:12,562
You were doing an accent. Whoa!

475
00:21:12,563 --> 00:21:15,565
Did you do all of this
just so that I would appreciate you?

476
00:21:15,566 --> 00:21:17,817
Deandra, I don't give a shit
what you think about me.

477
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:21,905
I was trying to show you
the magic of cake technology.

478
00:21:21,906 --> 00:21:24,617
You cried over a cake.

479
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:27,119
- Bravo. Bravo.
- Good job.

480
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:29,412
Hey, hey, hey. Pitch him the--

481
00:21:29,413 --> 00:21:33,625
That reminds me. Frank, what do you think
about Paddy's as a global franchise?

482
00:21:33,626 --> 00:21:36,336
- Like Starbucks for dive bars?
- He gets it. Yes.

483
00:21:36,337 --> 00:21:38,713
- That's it. Exactly.
- It's a terrible idea. I hate that idea.

484
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:41,216
- It's a stupid idea, man.
- That's a dumb, dumb idea.

485
00:21:41,217 --> 00:21:42,842
- That's why we need you.
- Dumbest idea ever.

486
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:45,136
That's why we need you, man.
Saving us from our dumb ideas.

487
00:21:47,223 --> 00:21:49,849
How is it, guys? Is it good?

488
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:50,975
It's really good.

489
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:53,645
- That really hurt my feelings.
- Frank, you're delicious.

490
00:21:53,646 --> 00:21:55,188
- Oh, yeah?
- Not bad.

491
00:21:55,189 --> 00:21:57,440
- It's pretty good.
- This is delicious.

492
00:21:57,441 --> 00:21:59,776
- The whole thing is a cake, by the way.
- Oh, my God.

493
00:21:59,777 --> 00:22:01,402
It goes all the way down to the feet.

494
00:22:01,403 --> 00:22:04,113
- Is the hair cake or...
- The hair is fondant.

495
00:22:04,114 --> 00:22:06,282
- You can just... Yeah.
- Really? Just eat the fondant?

496
00:22:06,283 --> 00:22:08,660
- What you can do with cake these days.
- Oh, my God.

497
00:22:08,661 --> 00:22:11,996
It does feel like the right stuff for us
to be focusing on as a group.

498
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:13,665
- Does it?
- What else can we make cake?

499
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:16,626
That's an idea, like, keeping our eye
on what's happening in the future

500
00:22:16,627 --> 00:22:18,170
and not being stuck in the past.
