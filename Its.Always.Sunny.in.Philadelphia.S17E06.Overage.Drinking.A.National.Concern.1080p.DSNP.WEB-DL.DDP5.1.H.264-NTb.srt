1
00:00:10,192 --> 00:00:12,777
- They are really going at it.
- Lot of tongue.

2
00:00:12,778 --> 00:00:13,861
Too much tongue.

3
00:00:13,862 --> 00:00:16,447
I think it's kind of weird
that we're watching them, right?

4
00:00:16,448 --> 00:00:18,408
Well, it's hot. I think it'd be weird
if we didn't watch them.

5
00:00:18,409 --> 00:00:21,202
They are super young though.

6
00:00:21,203 --> 00:00:23,956
- Yeah.
- In fact, everybody here is super young.

7
00:00:25,207 --> 00:00:26,959
- Oh, goddamn.
- Oh, come on.

8
00:00:27,459 --> 00:00:30,169
- Hey, are you 21?
- Yeah, what does it look like?

9
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:31,587
Yeah, fuck off, grandpa.

10
00:00:33,674 --> 00:00:35,341
- The mouth on him.
- I mean...

11
00:00:35,342 --> 00:00:36,592
- Heinous.
- Wait a second.

12
00:00:36,593 --> 00:00:38,052
Didn't we, like, just deal with this?

13
00:00:38,053 --> 00:00:39,846
We just dealt with
something like this.

14
00:00:39,847 --> 00:00:41,013
- We did, right?
- Not long ago.

15
00:00:41,014 --> 00:00:42,181
All right, let's kick 'em out.

16
00:00:42,182 --> 00:00:43,474
- Goddamn it, Son.
- Shit.

17
00:00:43,475 --> 00:00:45,935
- Oh, my God.
- I can't believe you're in a bar.

18
00:00:45,936 --> 00:00:47,520
You are in so much trouble.

19
00:00:47,521 --> 00:00:49,564
How many times do we have to tell you
to stay away from her?

20
00:00:49,565 --> 00:00:50,648
We're in love.

21
00:00:50,649 --> 00:00:52,817
Yeah, and there's nothing
you can do about it.

22
00:00:52,818 --> 00:00:56,362
- Ooh.
- Oh, my God. That was riveting.

23
00:00:56,363 --> 00:00:59,615
Yeah, turned into
a real Romeo and Juliet thing,
- didn't it?
- Yeah.

24
00:00:59,616 --> 00:01:01,159
I don't know what to do with him.

25
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:02,995
- He's gotta stop drinking.
- Hey, guys.

26
00:01:03,704 --> 00:01:05,247
You guys look familiar.

27
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:07,332
Yeah, you do too.

28
00:01:07,875 --> 00:01:10,334
Hang on a second. What are your names?

29
00:01:10,335 --> 00:01:12,004
I'm Trey. This is Tammy.

30
00:01:14,381 --> 00:01:19,011
Oh, shit. This is classic Tammy.

31
00:01:20,203 --> 00:01:23,050
OVERAGE

32
00:01:46,038 --> 00:01:48,080
Trey and Tammy
were lovers in high school,

33
00:01:48,081 --> 00:01:49,999
{\an8}but she wanted to make Trey jealous
by flirting with Dennis.

34
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,792
{\an8}Dee tried to bang Trey,
but he was only using her

35
00:01:51,793 --> 00:01:53,294
{\an8}to get back at Tammy and it worked.

36
00:01:53,295 --> 00:01:56,464
{\an8}They slept together on their prom night.
They had a baby that they named Trey Jr.

37
00:01:56,465 --> 00:01:58,966
Trey Jr.'s in love with that girl
named Kerry Bitaberry,

38
00:01:58,967 --> 00:02:00,676
but Trey and Tammy hate Kerry Bitaberry

39
00:02:00,677 --> 00:02:02,887
because the Bitaberry family is trash,
which they are.

40
00:02:02,888 --> 00:02:05,473
Dennis and Dee are, like,
super obsessed with Trey and Tammy still.

41
00:02:05,474 --> 00:02:07,016
I can pretty much tell
by their body language.

42
00:02:07,017 --> 00:02:08,727
I think they're gonna try to bang them.

43
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:13,189
Huh?
Did you say something? I wasn't listening.

44
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:14,815
Oh, yeah.
That's Trey and Tammy.

45
00:02:14,816 --> 00:02:17,151
They were lovers in high school.
Tammy tried to bang--

46
00:02:17,152 --> 00:02:20,905
Dude, I don't give a flying fuck
about any of this gossipy bullshit.

47
00:02:20,906 --> 00:02:24,116
- You're not into teen drama?
- No, because I am an adult.

48
00:02:24,117 --> 00:02:28,120
And I like adult stories, like a sexual
psychological thriller, you know?

49
00:02:28,121 --> 00:02:29,648
This has no weight to it.

50
00:02:29,748 --> 00:02:31,207
Well, this has been fun catching up.

51
00:02:31,208 --> 00:02:32,625
- Yeah.
- We're done? Okay.

52
00:02:32,626 --> 00:02:35,253
Yeah. Yeah, you know,
we should do this more often.

53
00:02:35,254 --> 00:02:38,047
It's so hard to believe we haven't
seen each other since high school.

54
00:02:38,048 --> 00:02:39,967
- Yeah.
- Well, since we were in high school.

55
00:02:40,467 --> 00:02:41,509
You were 30.

56
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:44,721
Okay. Well, let's not do that, you know?
Time's all in your head, Tammy.

57
00:02:45,305 --> 00:02:46,765
And in your ass, apparently.

58
00:02:49,393 --> 00:02:51,519
- She's just making a joke. You look great.
- It's true.

59
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,896
Well, if our son ever
comes back in here again,

60
00:02:53,897 --> 00:02:56,899
can you please send him home?
Or at least not sell him alcohol?

61
00:02:56,900 --> 00:03:00,695
Speaking of which. I assume
you will be picking up the tab, yeah?

62
00:03:00,696 --> 00:03:03,698
'Cause they kind of hustled out of here
and you are legal guardians.

63
00:03:03,699 --> 00:03:04,949
Yeah. I actually think that's a law.

64
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:07,452
I think you have
to pick up your child's tab if...

65
00:03:08,203 --> 00:03:10,496
Here. Let's go.

66
00:03:10,497 --> 00:03:11,831
- You gave him way too much-- Okay.
- Now.

67
00:03:11,832 --> 00:03:13,749
Oh, man.

68
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:16,419
What a trip down memory lane, huh?

69
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:18,963
- Trey looks good.
- Yeah, so does Tammy.

70
00:03:18,964 --> 00:03:21,424
Yeah, sometimes I feel like
she might be the one that got away.

71
00:03:21,425 --> 00:03:24,135
Hey, did you sense something
off between them?

72
00:03:24,136 --> 00:03:26,178
Something was off, right?
It was all in the body language.

73
00:03:26,179 --> 00:03:27,805
Yeah, there was a strain there,
right? Right?

74
00:03:27,806 --> 00:03:30,558
There was a strain there. God, that's hot.

75
00:03:30,559 --> 00:03:33,811
- Is it?
- Married, forbidden lust.

76
00:03:35,188 --> 00:03:37,690
I bet those two are just screaming
for some strange.

77
00:03:37,691 --> 00:03:39,233
Yeah.

78
00:03:39,234 --> 00:03:40,901
This is classic Dee and Dennis stuff.

79
00:03:40,902 --> 00:03:42,903
I think they're gonna try to sleep
with those two people

80
00:03:42,904 --> 00:03:44,363
that don't want to sleep with them at all.

81
00:03:44,364 --> 00:03:46,073
It's probably gonna wind up
in a rape or a murder.

82
00:03:46,074 --> 00:03:47,158
What?

83
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:48,242
Jesus Christ, man.

84
00:03:48,243 --> 00:03:49,994
You know we can hear you?
I would never do that.

85
00:03:49,995 --> 00:03:51,496
- Well...
- Don't tell her though.

86
00:03:56,626 --> 00:03:58,753
This is very exciting.
I got a couple of bits planned,

87
00:03:58,754 --> 00:04:00,588
- so just let me do my thing.
- Oh, you... Don't do bits.

88
00:04:00,589 --> 00:04:01,672
No, no. Trust me.

89
00:04:01,673 --> 00:04:03,883
Dee, I think let's throw 'em
off the scent at first.

90
00:04:03,884 --> 00:04:05,760
I don't see how that's gonna be possible

91
00:04:05,761 --> 00:04:08,179
- with all that cologne you're wearing.
- That's actually not a cologne.

92
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:10,973
No, that's a pheromone serum
I heard about on Rogan. Super cool, man.

93
00:04:10,974 --> 00:04:13,893
It's like testicular fluid from, like,
a bull's prostate or something like that.

94
00:04:13,894 --> 00:04:16,145
I know it sounds strange,
but it's scientifically proven

95
00:04:16,146 --> 00:04:18,398
to intimidate males
and drive females wild.

96
00:04:19,149 --> 00:04:20,717
Human females?

97
00:04:21,443 --> 00:04:22,903
Focus, Dee. Stop. All right, listen.

98
00:04:23,487 --> 00:04:25,738
Listen, once we get in there,
let's split off by gender, okay?

99
00:04:25,739 --> 00:04:28,366
I'll have a man-to-man talk with Trey,
and you do, I don't know,

100
00:04:28,367 --> 00:04:30,660
whatever it is that you females do
when you're alone with each other.

101
00:04:30,661 --> 00:04:33,037
And then let's find an excuse
to split off again--

102
00:04:33,038 --> 00:04:35,831
- Uh, take a shit.
- Too gross.

103
00:04:35,832 --> 00:04:37,667
Well, it's...
A shit is all I can think about.

104
00:04:37,668 --> 00:04:40,336
It's overwhelming,
the smell that's coming off of you.

105
00:04:40,337 --> 00:04:41,754
The smell isn't coming off right to you.

106
00:04:41,755 --> 00:04:44,215
It's a pheromonal thing
because you're my sister, okay?

107
00:04:44,216 --> 00:04:46,467
If it was working on you,
then we'd have a real problem,

108
00:04:46,468 --> 00:04:48,011
- wouldn't we?
- That would be bad. All right.

109
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,889
- Hey, Tammy. Hi.
- Tammy, we were just in the neighborhood,

110
00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:53,849
so we thought
we'd just swing by and say hi.

111
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:55,435
- Yeah.
- Oh. Hello.

112
00:04:57,479 --> 00:04:58,521
Are you expecting somebody else?

113
00:04:58,522 --> 00:05:01,565
No, no. I was just wondering
what that smell was.

114
00:05:01,566 --> 00:05:04,985
- Oh.
- I guess the lawn got fertilized. So...

115
00:05:06,405 --> 00:05:08,489
No, I think maybe, you're...

116
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:11,158
Maybe you're smelling
a cool spring breeze?

117
00:05:11,159 --> 00:05:12,868
Perhaps some freshly hung laundry.

118
00:05:12,869 --> 00:05:14,879
Did one of you step in dog shit?

119
00:05:17,791 --> 00:05:19,876
- I don't think so.
- I know I didn't.

120
00:05:20,711 --> 00:05:24,089
Okay, well, come on in.
Take your shoes off.

121
00:05:24,631 --> 00:05:26,341
- Jesus.
- No problem.

122
00:05:27,175 --> 00:05:28,802
Don't. Just don't.

123
00:05:35,434 --> 00:05:37,643
Hey, dude. All right.
Thanks for coming over, man.

124
00:05:37,644 --> 00:05:39,146
I need your help with something.

125
00:05:39,771 --> 00:05:40,939
Okay, w...

126
00:05:41,565 --> 00:05:45,484
That smell. Has Dennis been here?
I feel both intimidated and aroused.

127
00:05:45,485 --> 00:05:46,944
Know what that is?
That's the old piss cans.

128
00:05:46,945 --> 00:05:48,362
I haven't changed them in, like, forever.

129
00:05:48,363 --> 00:05:49,572
Is that why you asked me over here?

130
00:05:49,573 --> 00:05:51,616
No. Look, remember when you said, like,

131
00:05:52,159 --> 00:05:55,035
you wanted, like,
a sexual psychological thriller thing?

132
00:05:55,036 --> 00:05:56,454
You were more into those kind of stories.

133
00:05:56,455 --> 00:05:58,205
You wanna sink your teeth
into something like that,

134
00:05:58,206 --> 00:05:59,957
you know what I mean?
I got something for you.

135
00:05:59,958 --> 00:06:01,250
I'm listening.

136
00:06:01,251 --> 00:06:05,045
All right, take a look around this place.
Something's missing. What is it?

137
00:06:05,046 --> 00:06:07,965
- A vacuum.
- Stop. Come on, man. Be serious.

138
00:06:07,966 --> 00:06:11,802
I am dead serious. Buddy, how...
I don't get it.

139
00:06:11,803 --> 00:06:14,388
I mean, how can you be so obsessed
with cleaning the bar

140
00:06:14,389 --> 00:06:15,973
and yet you live
in all this piss and shit?

141
00:06:15,974 --> 00:06:17,057
Dude, it's Frank.

142
00:06:17,058 --> 00:06:20,144
- It's both of you.
- Will you stop? It's Frank that's missing.

143
00:06:20,145 --> 00:06:22,772
Well, how is that
a psychological sex thriller?

144
00:06:22,773 --> 00:06:25,191
Well, I don't know what it is,
but it's strange, you know what I mean?

145
00:06:25,192 --> 00:06:26,817
Like, he didn't come home last night.

146
00:06:26,818 --> 00:06:28,319
He hasn't been at the bar recently.

147
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:30,654
Like some of his stuff's missing,
you know?

148
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:33,115
I keep finding these, like,
weird piles of hair everywhere.

149
00:06:33,116 --> 00:06:35,117
The piles of hair could be from any one

150
00:06:35,118 --> 00:06:37,286
of the wild animals
that probably lives here.

151
00:06:37,287 --> 00:06:39,163
Well, you gotta admit
it's kind of strange.

152
00:06:39,164 --> 00:06:41,582
Well, I'm not exactly thrilled,
so it's not a thriller.

153
00:06:41,583 --> 00:06:44,251
But it is a mystery, I'll give you that.
Okay, I'll bite.

154
00:06:44,252 --> 00:06:46,253
Where do you and Frank go
when you're not together?

155
00:06:46,254 --> 00:06:48,881
Well, if we're not together,
we don't go anywhere.

156
00:06:48,882 --> 00:06:51,301
- Well, right now you're not together.
- Well, I'm here.

157
00:06:52,177 --> 00:06:53,802
I recognize where you are.

158
00:06:53,803 --> 00:06:56,055
What we're trying to do
is find out where Frank is.

159
00:06:56,056 --> 00:06:57,932
- Oh. Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Okay.

160
00:06:57,933 --> 00:06:59,391
Uh, he could be anywhere, you know?

161
00:06:59,392 --> 00:07:01,101
He could go under the bridge.
He goes there a lot.

162
00:07:01,102 --> 00:07:02,770
- All right, we're getting somewhere.
- Yeah.

163
00:07:02,771 --> 00:07:05,689
- Okay, I guess we gotta go...
- Check under the bridge. All right, cool.

164
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:07,149
Yeah, you see? You're pretty good at this.

165
00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:09,693
- That rules out anything sexy.
- Yeah.

166
00:07:09,694 --> 00:07:11,863
- Yeah. Okay, let's go.
- All right.

167
00:07:17,077 --> 00:07:18,786
There he is.

168
00:07:18,787 --> 00:07:20,204
I thought you were taking a shit.

169
00:07:20,205 --> 00:07:23,082
No. Come on, don't be silly.

170
00:07:23,083 --> 00:07:26,418
It's just the excuse I made
to sort of peel off and be alone with you.

171
00:07:26,419 --> 00:07:28,129
You were in the bathroom for,
like, 20 minutes.

172
00:07:29,089 --> 00:07:33,384
Yeah, I took a shit. But you know what?
That's your fault, mister.

173
00:07:33,385 --> 00:07:36,805
Because you get things moving
inside me, you know?

174
00:07:37,889 --> 00:07:38,931
- That's kind of gross.
- Okay.

175
00:07:38,932 --> 00:07:43,185
Listen, I'm trying to take a shot here,
but you're making it hard.

176
00:07:43,186 --> 00:07:44,436
Take a shot with what?

177
00:07:44,437 --> 00:07:49,441
Like a suburban married drama,
you know? A little infidelity.

178
00:07:49,442 --> 00:07:50,986
Okay. Look...

179
00:07:55,323 --> 00:07:59,994
If I'm being honest, uh, things aren't
great between me and Tammy,

180
00:07:59,995 --> 00:08:02,329
- Ooh.
- like sexually-wise right now.

181
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:05,374
Maybe spicing things up
in the bedroom might help.

182
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:08,669
Yes. Okay, now you're talking.

183
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:11,798
Okay. All right, let me finish up this
laundry and then we can slip out of here.

184
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:14,300
You always do the laundry?

185
00:08:14,301 --> 00:08:17,219
Yeah, and Tammy gets pissed
if I do it half-assed.

186
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:18,721
But I told her
that I'd pick some things up

187
00:08:18,722 --> 00:08:21,557
at the supermarket after I walk the dogs.

188
00:08:21,558 --> 00:08:23,726
So, I could sneak out after lunch.

189
00:08:23,727 --> 00:08:25,978
So you do the grocery shopping,
and you walk the dogs too?

190
00:08:25,979 --> 00:08:27,563
- And the laundry?
- I do, yeah. Yeah.

191
00:08:27,564 --> 00:08:29,064
- Do you do the dishes?
- I do.

192
00:08:29,065 --> 00:08:31,108
Tammy makes all the money,
I don't know what to tell you.

193
00:08:31,109 --> 00:08:35,905
But like, I got some things on the side.
I've been killing it at fantasy football.

194
00:08:36,406 --> 00:08:37,490
I gotta take a shit.

195
00:08:41,411 --> 00:08:43,621
Tammy, Tammy, Tammy.

196
00:08:43,622 --> 00:08:46,624
It's so great to be alone finally,
isn't it?

197
00:08:46,625 --> 00:08:48,500
God, I swear there's a dead animal
in here somewhere.

198
00:08:48,501 --> 00:08:50,920
- There's no dead animal in here.
- Might have to fumigate the entire house.

199
00:08:50,921 --> 00:08:52,255
Enough with the smells. Let's...

200
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:55,215
Let's focus on the feelings.

201
00:08:55,216 --> 00:08:56,300
The feelings?

202
00:08:56,301 --> 00:08:59,261
Yeah, well, you're feeling trapped.
You're feeling depressed.

203
00:08:59,262 --> 00:09:03,265
Life used to be so exciting,
and now it's dull and dreary.

204
00:09:03,266 --> 00:09:05,392
Well, being married
isn't the easiest thing in the world.

205
00:09:05,393 --> 00:09:09,438
I can only imagine.
I wouldn't know though.

206
00:09:09,439 --> 00:09:13,734
Yeah, I live free. Like a wild beast.

207
00:09:13,735 --> 00:09:15,110
Okay.

208
00:09:15,111 --> 00:09:17,237
Maybe Trey's gotten
a little bit too complacent.

209
00:09:17,238 --> 00:09:21,910
Maybe old Tammy needs to take
a page out of young Tammy's notebook.

210
00:09:22,494 --> 00:09:24,036
What are you talking about?

211
00:09:24,037 --> 00:09:26,039
Let's bang and make Trey jealous.

212
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:31,002
Oh, God. That's what this is about?

213
00:09:31,878 --> 00:09:33,170
Yeah.

214
00:09:33,171 --> 00:09:34,589
I'm not gonna bang you.

215
00:09:35,966 --> 00:09:37,300
- Well...
- Uh-uh.

216
00:09:49,521 --> 00:09:50,647
I have to take a shit.

217
00:09:52,941 --> 00:09:55,567
- Trey's a pussy. I couldn't do it.
- Yeah, I couldn't do it either.

218
00:09:55,568 --> 00:09:57,987
Tammy was all over me,
but I found the whole thing boring.

219
00:09:57,988 --> 00:09:59,613
You know why? Because it's adult drama.

220
00:09:59,614 --> 00:10:00,698
That's why it's boring.

221
00:10:00,699 --> 00:10:02,992
Teen drama is exciting
'cause everything's brand-new.

222
00:10:02,993 --> 00:10:06,495
Adult stuff's just the same thing
over and over and over and over.

223
00:10:06,496 --> 00:10:10,499
Yeah. See, teen drama's forged in lust.
Adult drama's forged in sadness.

224
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,710
So sad. He was folding the laundry.

225
00:10:12,711 --> 00:10:14,586
- What?
- He does that every day.

226
00:10:14,587 --> 00:10:16,630
- She should be doing that.
- Of course she should.

227
00:10:16,631 --> 00:10:18,799
You know what else?
He goes grocery shopping.

228
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,260
What? Why?

229
00:10:20,844 --> 00:10:22,261
Because he's a pussy like I said.

230
00:10:22,262 --> 00:10:25,932
Oh. Okay. Well, let's get out of here
'cause I do have to take shit for real.

231
00:10:26,599 --> 00:10:27,600
Not me.

232
00:10:30,437 --> 00:10:32,730
I'm actually getting a little worried
about Frank, man.

233
00:10:32,731 --> 00:10:35,316
All right, well, don't get melodramatic.
This isn't a soap opera.

234
00:10:35,942 --> 00:10:38,319
Why do they call 'em that?
There's no soap involved.

235
00:10:39,195 --> 00:10:41,280
- And no singing.
- Right? Nothing operatic about it.

236
00:10:41,281 --> 00:10:43,824
No, not sure. Either way,
it's not the kind of mystery we want.

237
00:10:43,825 --> 00:10:47,786
You see, we want a rising tension
to make the comedy or tragedy

238
00:10:47,787 --> 00:10:48,996
feel more satisfying in the end.

239
00:10:48,997 --> 00:10:50,914
The wha... The tragedy?

240
00:10:50,915 --> 00:10:52,416
Yeah.
We don't know what this is yet, Charlie.

241
00:10:52,417 --> 00:10:54,168
Well, how would a tragedy feel satisfying?

242
00:10:54,169 --> 00:10:56,086
Well, okay. What if we came down here
and we found Frank

243
00:10:56,087 --> 00:10:58,047
with a bullet in his head
and a suicide note?

244
00:10:58,048 --> 00:11:00,841
- Not satisfying.
- Not satisfying. Very tragic.

245
00:11:00,842 --> 00:11:04,011
However, there could be an overall
poetic sense of completion

246
00:11:04,012 --> 00:11:05,471
to his inevitable story arc

247
00:11:05,472 --> 00:11:07,557
due to Frank's historically
terrible life choices.

248
00:11:08,183 --> 00:11:11,018
And somehow, as a viewer,

249
00:11:11,019 --> 00:11:13,854
- I would feel satisfied by the...
- There would be a subconscious...

250
00:11:13,855 --> 00:11:16,023
Yeah, that's not gonna work
for me at all, man.

251
00:11:16,024 --> 00:11:17,608
What the hell are you talking about, dude?

252
00:11:17,609 --> 00:11:19,151
- Well, it's the hero's journey.
- There he is.

253
00:11:19,152 --> 00:11:21,571
Cricket. Hey, man.

254
00:11:22,363 --> 00:11:25,949
Shit. What's good, baby? What's popping?

255
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:28,911
What's with the, uh, dreadlocks
and the voice you're doing?

256
00:11:28,912 --> 00:11:30,496
Oh. Yeah no, ain't no voice, baby.

257
00:11:30,497 --> 00:11:33,248
I'm just evolving right down here
under the bridge, you know what I mean?

258
00:11:33,249 --> 00:11:35,667
Just trying to spread my business
to a more diverse clientele,

259
00:11:35,668 --> 00:11:37,878
- you know what I mean?
- No. I don't feel you, no.

260
00:11:37,879 --> 00:11:40,839
I feel like this is not cool.
Like, is this a good plot twist?

261
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:41,924
- What is this?
- This is...

262
00:11:41,925 --> 00:11:44,093
There's nothing good about this.
This is giving me the ick.

263
00:11:44,094 --> 00:11:45,177
Yeah, this is just...

264
00:11:45,178 --> 00:11:47,930
I feel like we're dancing around
a very dangerous line here.

265
00:11:47,931 --> 00:11:50,516
You know, just having, like,
a white guy talking like, you know,

266
00:11:50,517 --> 00:11:53,268
"What it is, man?" Is not...
I'm just doing Cricket.

267
00:11:53,269 --> 00:11:55,604
- I'm just doing Cricket. Right?
- We're not supposed to do it.

268
00:11:55,605 --> 00:11:56,814
We're past it as a society.

269
00:11:56,815 --> 00:11:59,858
It's okay for the detective
to make fun of the suspect.

270
00:11:59,859 --> 00:12:02,486
Hold up. Why y'all saying suspect?
Am I a suspect?

271
00:12:02,487 --> 00:12:05,030
Well, we don't know
what you are yet, do we, Cricket?

272
00:12:05,031 --> 00:12:07,241
If this got something to do
with that john who got his dick bit off,

273
00:12:07,242 --> 00:12:09,493
I don't know shit, all right?
I wasn't there, and I didn't see shit.

274
00:12:09,494 --> 00:12:11,120
And I don't know where the dick is, okay?

275
00:12:11,121 --> 00:12:13,914
- You bit a dude's dick off, man?
- No, I didn't bite it. No, no.

276
00:12:13,915 --> 00:12:15,874
They take the dick,
and I don't know what they do with it,

277
00:12:15,875 --> 00:12:16,959
and I don't ask, okay?

278
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,293
- Who's they?
- Who's they?

279
00:12:18,294 --> 00:12:20,337
It doesn't matter 'cause I don't
know shit, and I'm not talking.

280
00:12:20,338 --> 00:12:23,006
I'm gonna blow past this,
especially 'cause I feel uncomfortable

281
00:12:23,007 --> 00:12:24,800
with you talking like this. Where's Frank?

282
00:12:25,969 --> 00:12:29,388
- Now, that I really can't talk about.
- Why not?

283
00:12:29,389 --> 00:12:32,182
Well, he made me sign an NDA,
so this cricket ain't chirping.

284
00:12:32,183 --> 00:12:34,726
An NDA? That's good. That brings us
right back around to a mystery.

285
00:12:34,727 --> 00:12:35,811
How's that good, dude?

286
00:12:35,812 --> 00:12:39,065
It means there's a paper trail.
Cricket, do you have a copy of this NDA?

287
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:43,485
Maybe I do. Maybe I don't.

288
00:12:43,486 --> 00:12:46,738
Stop with this, dude. Stop.
I'm gonna kick the shit out of you, man.

289
00:12:46,739 --> 00:12:48,407
- Don't step to me.
- Okay, all right.

290
00:12:48,408 --> 00:12:50,826
- All right, I won't. I won't, but...
- Don't step to him.

291
00:12:50,827 --> 00:12:52,536
I need to know where Frank is, bro.

292
00:12:52,537 --> 00:12:54,913
All right. You know... You know...
Goddamn, fine.

293
00:12:54,914 --> 00:12:57,332
I'll give you this,
but then your Marian the Librarian ass

294
00:12:57,333 --> 00:12:59,459
has gotta roll up out of here.
Man, y'all blowing up my spot.

295
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:02,004
<i>- What is Marian the Librarian?
- The Music Man. Know your culture.</i>

296
00:13:02,005 --> 00:13:04,131
I feel so uncomfortable
with this whole thing.

297
00:13:04,132 --> 00:13:06,633
"Matthew Mara is hereby barred
from any communication

298
00:13:06,634 --> 00:13:09,052
about Frank Reynolds
or Frank will sue his ass."

299
00:13:09,053 --> 00:13:10,971
Well, that doesn't help us at all, dude.

300
00:13:10,972 --> 00:13:13,807
Yes, it does. Look who his lawyer is.

301
00:13:13,808 --> 00:13:17,653
- Who?
- Jack Kelly, attorney-at-lawyering.

302
00:13:21,065 --> 00:13:24,276
Okay, you're sure this wouldn't
be better to handle at my office?

303
00:13:24,277 --> 00:13:27,404
You have an office?
That in itself is a mysterious twist.

304
00:13:27,405 --> 00:13:29,239
No, he doesn't.
He's talking about my mom's basement.

305
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:31,366
I have a filing cabinet and a computer.

306
00:13:31,367 --> 00:13:33,777
You have a filing cabinet
until the FBI comes.

307
00:13:34,662 --> 00:13:36,538
It's so annoying we got to go through him.

308
00:13:36,539 --> 00:13:39,041
- Okay, all right.
- What is the deal with Frank and this NDA?

309
00:13:39,042 --> 00:13:41,668
He's been getting some of
his affairs in order.

310
00:13:41,669 --> 00:13:44,671
What does that mean, his affairs? What's
going on with him? Where is the guy?

311
00:13:44,672 --> 00:13:47,132
Okay, well, he passed info to me,

312
00:13:47,133 --> 00:13:49,593
but I only have permission
to show Charlie.

313
00:13:49,594 --> 00:13:50,761
Why?

314
00:13:50,762 --> 00:13:54,181
Well, because he's the one listed
as the president of Frank's foundation.

315
00:13:54,182 --> 00:13:58,518
Okay. Well, this is news to me.
I'm sorry, what foundation?

316
00:13:58,519 --> 00:14:00,687
Yeah, and what's my role
in the foundation?

317
00:14:01,856 --> 00:14:05,734
Well, I'm not seeing you
listed anywhere in here.

318
00:14:05,735 --> 00:14:08,737
That's impossible. Frank's always
talking about me, isn't he?

319
00:14:08,738 --> 00:14:10,697
And how I should be
more involved in his affairs.

320
00:14:10,698 --> 00:14:12,240
I'm gonna tell Charlie,

321
00:14:12,241 --> 00:14:14,368
and then after I leave,
he can tell you if he likes.

322
00:14:14,369 --> 00:14:15,661
This is bullshit.

323
00:14:15,662 --> 00:14:17,621
Charlie, there's gotta be room
for me in the foundation.

324
00:14:17,622 --> 00:14:19,706
I don't know. You know,
there's a lot to think about

325
00:14:19,707 --> 00:14:21,291
now that I'm president,
you know what I mean?

326
00:14:21,292 --> 00:14:24,336
I gotta find Frank.
I gotta find out what I'm president of.

327
00:14:24,337 --> 00:14:27,715
You know, these are big decisions.
They're kinda over your head, man.

328
00:14:28,341 --> 00:14:31,302
Yeah. All right, I'm gonna pass
the info to you, okay?

329
00:14:31,928 --> 00:14:34,888
Whoa! I didn't sign off on that maneuver.

330
00:14:34,889 --> 00:14:36,139
Charlie, we've got an address.

331
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:37,557
Yeah, but I didn't sign off on that, man.

332
00:14:37,558 --> 00:14:39,768
I needed to be able
to do my job, all right?

333
00:14:39,769 --> 00:14:42,896
This is my job, getting the information,
getting the facts.

334
00:14:42,897 --> 00:14:45,607
This is thrilling. What is this?

335
00:14:45,608 --> 00:14:49,444
Uh, it seems like we've transitioned
into a bit of a political thriller.

336
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:54,950
I like those. Needs a chase scene.
You wanna chase me around the apartment?

337
00:14:54,951 --> 00:14:58,371
- Uh, no, we're not gonna do that
- I don't wanna be in that movie.
with you, Uncle Jack.

338
00:15:03,751 --> 00:15:05,294
Well, I banged her.

339
00:15:05,878 --> 00:15:06,878
- What?
- Yeah.

340
00:15:06,879 --> 00:15:10,257
- Who? Tammy?
- No, uh, Tammy's son's prom date.

341
00:15:10,258 --> 00:15:12,217
- Kerry Bitaberry?
- Yeah.

342
00:15:12,218 --> 00:15:16,513
Yeah.
Yeah, I was going for that
forbidden teen drama thing, you know?

343
00:15:16,514 --> 00:15:18,807
I convinced her that Trey Jr.
cheated on her,

344
00:15:18,808 --> 00:15:21,309
and the only way she could get back
at him was to sleep with me.

345
00:15:22,395 --> 00:15:23,478
Gross.

346
00:15:23,479 --> 00:15:26,815
Yeah, and you know what?
It was kinda gross, but probably not
for the reasons you're thinking.

347
00:15:26,816 --> 00:15:29,151
It was gross
because she wasn't satisfying to me.

348
00:15:29,152 --> 00:15:31,236
She didn't know any moves, you know?

349
00:15:31,237 --> 00:15:33,447
I tried to teach her, but she wouldn't
listen to any of my commands.

350
00:15:33,448 --> 00:15:34,656
Can you believe this?

351
00:15:34,657 --> 00:15:36,533
Yeah, and now
she's blowing up my phone, you know?

352
00:15:36,534 --> 00:15:39,077
She made me a playlist, like...
We don't have a song.

353
00:15:39,078 --> 00:15:41,413
How could we have a song together?
We listen to no music whatsoever.

354
00:15:41,414 --> 00:15:44,249
The whole thing was done in silence.
Except for the noises that I was making.

355
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:45,625
- Stop.
- What's grossing you out?

356
00:15:45,626 --> 00:15:47,878
- The fact that she wasn't satisfying me?
- The fact that she's a child.

357
00:15:47,879 --> 00:15:49,129
No, she's not a child.

358
00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:51,298
- She's 19 years old, I checked.
- Still a teen.

359
00:15:51,299 --> 00:15:53,800
Well, she has to be a teen. I thought
we were doing a Romeo and Juliet thing.

360
00:15:53,801 --> 00:15:55,677
Juliet was not banging an old man.

361
00:15:55,678 --> 00:15:57,262
Dee, you know what? Just stop.

362
00:15:57,263 --> 00:15:59,389
I think the fact that she was 19
is actually the reason

363
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:01,600
why Trey and Tammy
didn't want their son dating her,

364
00:16:01,601 --> 00:16:03,935
because she was robbing the cradle.
You know?

365
00:16:03,936 --> 00:16:06,646
- Okay, all right.
- Why are you so grossed out by this?

366
00:16:06,647 --> 00:16:08,523
- You know what? I gotta go.
- Where are you going?

367
00:16:08,524 --> 00:16:10,400
I gotta go bang Trey Jr.

368
00:16:10,401 --> 00:16:11,985
Why?

369
00:16:11,986 --> 00:16:13,863
Because we're doing a thing
and I gotta win.

370
00:16:19,827 --> 00:16:20,827
All right.

371
00:16:20,828 --> 00:16:23,330
His address is a storage unit.
You think he's in there?

372
00:16:23,331 --> 00:16:24,873
I don't know, man.
Yeah, this could be, like,

373
00:16:24,874 --> 00:16:27,000
the secret headquarters of
the foundation or something.

374
00:16:27,001 --> 00:16:29,669
That seems more like
a James Bond spy thing.

375
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:30,754
That doesn't really fit.

376
00:16:30,755 --> 00:16:34,341
I don't know, dude. The foundation's got
a lot of international stuff happening.

377
00:16:34,342 --> 00:16:36,260
You don't even know
what the foundation is.

378
00:16:36,803 --> 00:16:39,514
- Got it. Sixty-nine. Sixty-nine.
- Well, of course.

379
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:44,643
- No Frank.
- Yeah.

380
00:16:44,644 --> 00:16:48,397
{\an8}What is this?
"Toys for the foundation. Ship to Africa."

381
00:16:49,273 --> 00:16:52,109
I told you we had international dealings,
you know what I mean?

382
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:54,487
Africa is a big market for us, you know?

383
00:16:55,071 --> 00:16:59,950
We do a lot of, you know,
trading of... in the toy sector.

384
00:16:59,951 --> 00:17:01,868
You know, don't even ask
too many questions about it.

385
00:17:01,869 --> 00:17:02,953
It's, like, annoying how much

386
00:17:02,954 --> 00:17:04,746
you're prying me about
trying to be in the foundation.

387
00:17:04,747 --> 00:17:05,873
Let's see what's in here.

388
00:17:06,707 --> 00:17:08,875
I mean, like,
maybe I can finagle you like a...

389
00:17:08,876 --> 00:17:12,712
like an entry level position,
but I can't just put you on the board or...

390
00:17:12,713 --> 00:17:14,090
What am I looking at here? What is this?

391
00:17:14,715 --> 00:17:18,552
"Rhino." These are dick pills, man. Jesus.

392
00:17:18,553 --> 00:17:20,720
All right, well it took a sexual turn.
That's kind of interesting.

393
00:17:20,721 --> 00:17:22,430
What is he doing in here
with the dick pills?

394
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:24,141
What's on the tape? What is this about?

395
00:17:24,142 --> 00:17:27,060
I don't know. Should we watch it?
I don't want to.

396
00:17:27,061 --> 00:17:29,229
Yeah, I'm a little concerned
about what I might see here.

397
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:32,774
I think you got to shield your eyes
because he's most likely,

398
00:17:32,775 --> 00:17:35,652
almost definitely,
for sure gonna be naked and fucking.

399
00:17:35,653 --> 00:17:38,155
Let's just hit play
and let's just see what it's about.

400
00:17:38,156 --> 00:17:41,409
- Okay, we'll just... Yeah, okay. And...
- Let me know if he's got his...

401
00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:46,246
<i>Hey, I'm Frank.
I've had a few great loves in my life.</i>

402
00:17:46,247 --> 00:17:50,668
<i>I lost one to racial injustice.
Another one OD'd.</i>

403
00:17:51,294 --> 00:17:54,338
<i>Lost a wife to a botched neck job,
but that's a whole other story.</i>

404
00:17:55,506 --> 00:17:59,301
<i>But I haven't had a love in my life
for a long time, you know?</i>

405
00:17:59,302 --> 00:18:01,595
<i>And I'm not sure how long
I can go on without it.</i>

406
00:18:04,682 --> 00:18:05,807
- That's it?
- I don't know.

407
00:18:05,808 --> 00:18:08,518
<i>{\an8}Looks like he taped over
some old Highlander episodes</i>

408
00:18:08,519 --> 00:18:10,103
- and ran out of tape.
- He always does that.

409
00:18:10,104 --> 00:18:11,438
He forgets where the tape...

410
00:18:11,439 --> 00:18:14,191
What is this, man? What's he doing?
I don't get it.

411
00:18:14,192 --> 00:18:16,402
He's doing a lot of dick pills,
'cause these are all empty.

412
00:18:17,195 --> 00:18:20,864
Oh, shit. Oh, shit, dude. That's not good.

413
00:18:20,865 --> 00:18:24,035
Frank always said he wanted his dick
and his heart to explode at the same time.

414
00:18:25,119 --> 00:18:26,245
Dude, did he kill himself?

415
00:18:27,163 --> 00:18:29,806
If he did, he did it hard as a rock.

416
00:18:36,714 --> 00:18:37,757
Knock, knock.

417
00:18:39,258 --> 00:18:41,260
Jesus Christ. You are a boy.

418
00:18:42,345 --> 00:18:45,597
Sorry, you are a lot younger than I...
than I remember.

419
00:18:45,598 --> 00:18:48,558
Yeah.
In my head you looked
a bit more like a man,

420
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:50,727
but boy, are you not.
You're a kid. You're a kid.

421
00:18:50,728 --> 00:18:53,522
- How in God's name did Dennis do this?
- Do what?

422
00:18:53,523 --> 00:18:55,065
I'm trying to beat my brother.
You wouldn't get it.

423
00:18:55,066 --> 00:18:57,067
- Are you the lady from the bar?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

424
00:18:57,068 --> 00:18:58,985
Let's just power through
and get to the hot part, right?

425
00:18:58,986 --> 00:19:01,988
So sex. Sex.

426
00:19:01,989 --> 00:19:05,825
You are inexperienced and sex is exciting
and maybe a little nerve-wracking.

427
00:19:05,826 --> 00:19:08,078
The kids at my school have been sleeping
with each other for a decade.

428
00:19:08,079 --> 00:19:11,331
I don't need your whole backstory.
You are 18, right?

429
00:19:11,332 --> 00:19:12,624
I don't wanna be mean,

430
00:19:12,625 --> 00:19:14,418
but my granny isn't
that much older than you.

431
00:19:16,045 --> 00:19:17,630
- Your granny?
- Yeah.

432
00:19:18,881 --> 00:19:22,217
Um, I will have you know I went
to high school with your mom. So...

433
00:19:22,218 --> 00:19:24,428
She said when she was
in high school you were 40.

434
00:19:25,096 --> 00:19:26,888
- I was 30.
- What's the difference?

435
00:19:26,889 --> 00:19:29,474
Ten years! Ten years is the diff...

436
00:19:29,475 --> 00:19:32,228
Listen to me, you little shit.
Dennis slept with your prom date.

437
00:19:33,396 --> 00:19:37,066
Oh, yeah. Does that make you sad?

438
00:19:38,234 --> 00:19:41,654
Do you wanna suck your thumb,
little boy? I gotta go.

439
00:19:44,865 --> 00:19:47,909
Well, you win, Dennis. I couldn't do it.

440
00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:50,078
So it wasn't really
a win-lose thing maybe.

441
00:19:50,079 --> 00:19:51,454
Of course it was, all right.

442
00:19:51,455 --> 00:19:54,082
But to be very clear, the kid wanted to,
I just am not a criminal.

443
00:19:54,083 --> 00:19:57,002
I'm not a criminal either.
Kerry Bitaberry is 19 years old.

444
00:19:57,003 --> 00:20:00,380
The only crime here is Kerry Bitaberry's
inability to satisfy a lover.

445
00:20:00,381 --> 00:20:02,924
Well, then I probably did Trey Jr.
a favor by telling him.

446
00:20:02,925 --> 00:20:04,926
Yeah, I guess... Wait, what? You told him?

447
00:20:04,927 --> 00:20:06,803
Yeah, I told him. He took it pretty hard.

448
00:20:06,804 --> 00:20:10,141
It was juicy. I think he's gonna try
and fight you after school.

449
00:20:10,725 --> 00:20:13,393
Although, watching a grown man
be pummeled by a kid in his prime

450
00:20:13,394 --> 00:20:15,895
is more sad than dramatic,
if I'm being honest.

451
00:20:15,896 --> 00:20:19,024
Goddamn it, Dee.
Why'd you tell him? I mean, that's...

452
00:20:19,025 --> 00:20:20,734
<i>...two local teens attempted suicide</i>

453
00:20:20,735 --> 00:20:23,528
<i>{\an8}when they drove off
the Strawberry Mansion Bridge.</i>

454
00:20:23,529 --> 00:20:25,989
<i>{\an8}Fortunately, the teens survived the crash,</i>

455
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:30,076
<i>{\an8}although both sustained injuries
and will be likely severely disfigured.</i>

456
00:20:33,164 --> 00:20:35,665
Well, I could definitely kick his ass now,
right? He's all jacked up.

457
00:20:35,666 --> 00:20:37,250
Wha... What?

458
00:20:37,251 --> 00:20:39,920
You're not gonna make me feel bad
about this, okay? I don't feel bad.

459
00:20:42,173 --> 00:20:43,423
I don't feel anything.

460
00:20:43,424 --> 00:20:46,176
Guys, we got a problem.

461
00:20:46,177 --> 00:20:47,710
Frank took all his dick pills.

462
00:20:48,763 --> 00:20:51,473
- He's gonna commit suicide.
- He's gonna commit suicide.

463
00:20:51,474 --> 00:20:54,934
- Yeah, yeah. 'Cause his penis is...
- Hey, speaking of suicide.

464
00:20:54,935 --> 00:20:56,811
Dennis almost killed
a couple of teenagers.

465
00:20:56,812 --> 00:20:58,813
Yeah, they drove off a bridge,
but they're still alive.

466
00:20:58,814 --> 00:21:00,398
Who? Kerry Bitaberry and Trey Jr.?

467
00:21:00,399 --> 00:21:01,524
- That's them.
- You bet.

468
00:21:01,525 --> 00:21:03,652
- That's classic Dennis.
- Come on, man.

469
00:21:03,653 --> 00:21:06,696
Maybe teen drama does have some weight
to it 'cause that's like a tragedy.

470
00:21:06,697 --> 00:21:10,241
Uh, well... I mean,
it's really only a tragedy if they die.

471
00:21:10,242 --> 00:21:13,161
You know, if they're just,
like, mangled and stuff,

472
00:21:13,162 --> 00:21:16,081
then I think it's nothing.
It's not anything.

473
00:21:16,082 --> 00:21:18,583
- You know, maybe a horror film?
- All right, well, we're still in a mystery

474
00:21:18,584 --> 00:21:20,293
- 'cause Frank is missing.
- Uh, guys...

475
00:21:20,294 --> 00:21:22,295
<i>- ...one of Philadelphia's own has been...
- I think I found him.</i>

476
00:21:22,296 --> 00:21:24,422
<i>{\an8}...selected to be the next Golden Bachelor.</i>

477
00:21:24,423 --> 00:21:29,052
<i>{\an8}Local businessman and philanthropist,
Frank Reynolds is looking for love.</i>

478
00:21:29,053 --> 00:21:32,306
<i>{\an8}Frank's Global Youth Foundation
brings joy to needy children.</i>

479
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:37,103
<i>{\an8}I want to share that joy with someone
I can spend the rest of my life with.</i>

480
00:21:38,229 --> 00:21:41,398
{\an8}Seems like a great guy.
We hope you find true love, Frank.

481
00:21:41,399 --> 00:21:42,733
{\an8}We'll be rooting for you.

482
00:21:44,026 --> 00:21:46,744
Well, that's what you call a plot twist.
