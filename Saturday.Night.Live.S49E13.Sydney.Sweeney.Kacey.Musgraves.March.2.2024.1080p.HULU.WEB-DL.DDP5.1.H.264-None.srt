1
00:00:05,884 --> 00:00:08,092
>>> GOOD AFTERNOON, I'M DANA
BASH,

2
00:00:08,092 --> 00:00:11,435
AND WELCOME TO INSIDE POLITICS.

3
00:00:11,854 --> 00:00:15,079
COMING UP, WE'LL GIVE WOLF
BLITZER AN EDIBLE

4
00:00:15,079 --> 00:00:17,324
AND AN HOUR TO
SOLVE THE MIDDLE EAST.

5
00:00:17,324 --> 00:00:21,563
BUT FIRST, ON TUESDAY, PRESIDENT
JOE BIDEN WON THE WISH PRIMARY,

6
00:00:21,563 --> 00:00:24,582
BUT A NEW YORK TIMES POLL HAS
HIM DOWN FIVE POINTS,

7
00:00:24,582 --> 00:00:27,206
AND MANY
VOTERS STILL HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT
HIS AGE.

8
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:30,556
HERE WITH ME IS GOVERNOR OF
CALIFORNIA AND BIDEN ADVOCATE,

9
00:00:30,556 --> 00:00:31,953
GAVIN NEWSOM.

10
00:00:31,953 --> 00:00:33,908
>> GREAT TO BE WITH YOU, DANA.

11
00:00:33,908 --> 00:00:36,695
I UNDERSTAND PEOPLE CARE ABOUT
THE PRESIDENT'S AGE,

12
00:00:36,695 --> 00:00:38,926
BUT THEY
SHOULD CARE ABOUT HIS RECORD.

13
00:00:38,926 --> 00:00:41,265
DONE

14
00:00:41,265 --> 00:00:43,708
HE'S CREATED MORE JOBS THAN ANY
PRESIDENT IN HISTORY,

15
00:00:43,708 --> 00:00:46,223
INFLATION
IS DOWN, THE SHAMROCK SHAKE IS BACK,

16
00:00:46,223 --> 00:00:48,503
AND BEYONCE HAS GONE
COUNTRY.

17
00:00:48,503 --> 00:00:50,688
THANK YOU, JOE.

18
00:00:50,688 --> 00:00:55,748
>> RIGHT.
BUT CAN HE MAKE THAT CASE WITH
THE SPEED AND SHARPNESS THAT
SOMEONE LIKE YOU CAN?

19
00:00:55,748 --> 00:00:58,506
>> JOE CAN DO IT BETTER.

20
00:00:58,506 --> 00:01:02,034
BEHIND CLOSED DOORS, JOE IS
INCREDIBLE.

21
00:01:02,034 --> 00:01:06,316
YESTERDAY WE HAD A BIG MEETING
ABOUT THE BORDER, AND HE HAD
SUCH COMMAND.

22
00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:08,790
HE HAD CHARTS, TABLES, POWER POINTS,

23
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:12,255
HE HAD AN INTERACTIVE AR
DISPLAY ON THE APPLE VISION PRO

24
00:01:12,255 --> 00:01:14,173
THAT HE PROGRAMMED HIMSELF.

25
00:01:14,173 --> 00:01:18,515
THE SOFTWARE MIGHT BE IN BETA,
BUT THE MAN IS AN ALPHA.

26
00:01:18,515 --> 00:01:21,582
>> I'M A LITTLE SKEPTICAL

27
00:01:21,582 --> 00:01:24,432
THIS IS THE SAME MAN PEOPLE CALL
SLEEPY JOE.

28
00:01:24,432 --> 00:01:27,597
>> WELL, HE HAS TO SLEEP, DANA.

29
00:01:27,914 --> 00:01:30,044
EVEN WHEN HE'S SLEEPING, HE'S
ON.

30
00:01:30,044 --> 00:01:32,458
THE OTHER DAY, HE WAS TAKING A
NAP, AND I WHIPPED A BASEBALL AT HIM

31
00:01:32,458 --> 00:01:35,172
AND HE CAUGHT IT

32
00:01:35,257 --> 00:01:36,923
LIGHTNING QUICK.

33
00:01:36,923 --> 00:01:40,339
ASK

34
00:01:40,339 --> 00:01:45,511
>> LET'S GO LIVE TO WASHINGTON
WITH KARINE JEAN-PIERRE.

35
00:01:45,582 --> 00:01:47,421
>> HELLO.

36
00:01:47,421 --> 00:01:52,422
PLEASURE TO BE WITH YOU TO TALK
ABOUT THE MOST VIGOROUS MAN I'VE
EVER KNOWN, JOE BIDEN.

37
00:01:52,422 --> 00:01:54,251
REALLY

38
00:01:54,251 --> 00:01:57,862
I WAS JUST WITH HIM, AND BEHIND
CLOSED DOORS, HE'S A WHIRLWIND.

39
00:01:57,862 --> 00:01:59,787
LOOK AT HIS SCHEDULE.

40
00:01:59,787 --> 00:02:02,153
7:00 A.M., SOULCYCLE CLASS,

41
00:02:02,153 --> 00:02:05,561
AND HE LEADS IT.

42
00:02:05,561 --> 00:02:08,923
8:30 A.M., PLAY SPEED CHESS IN
THE PARK.

43
00:02:08,923 --> 00:02:11,429
8:32 A.M., WINS CHESS GAME,

44
00:02:11,429 --> 00:02:14,921
POINTS AT OPPONENT AND SAYS,
NEXT TIME YOUNG BLOOD.

45
00:02:14,921 --> 00:02:19,507
9:30 A.M., MEET WITH JOINT
CHIEFS FOR A MILITARY STRATEGY NEATING

46
00:02:19,507 --> 00:02:20,912
AND PUSHUP CONTEST.

47
00:02:20,912 --> 00:02:23,230
WINS CONTEST,

48
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:27,274
POINTS AT THE HEAD
OF THE JOINT CHIEFS AND SAYS,
NEXT TIME YOUNG BLOOD.

49
00:02:27,274 --> 00:02:29,992
THEN, TRAIN TIME.

50
00:02:29,992 --> 00:02:34,649
THAT'S ALL BEFORE A LUNCH WHERE
HE EATS FIVE WHOLE CHICKENS AND
A RAW POTATO.

51
00:02:34,649 --> 00:02:37,499
>> BIDEN IS 81 YEARS OLD.

52
00:02:37,499 --> 00:02:38,862
ISN'T THAT A LITTLE CONCERNING?

53
00:02:38,862 --> 00:02:40,672
>> ONLY IF YOU'RE SCARED OF
WISDOM.

54
00:02:40,672 --> 00:02:45,238
JOE BIDEN WAS 34 YEARS OLD
BEFORE ROE VERSUS WADE WAS STATED,

55
00:02:45,238 --> 00:02:47,753
SO YOU KNOW HE WAS
SMASHING.

56
00:02:48,129 --> 00:02:52,395
HE DEALT WITH THOSE RESTRICTIONS
THEN AS A YOUNG HANDSOME MAN,

57
00:02:52,395 --> 00:02:55,731
AND HE CAN DEAL WITH THEM NOW AS
AN OLD EVEN MORE HANDSOME MAN.

58
00:02:55,731 --> 00:02:57,963
ASK ANYONE WHO WORKS WITH HIM
CLOSELY.

59
00:02:57,964 --> 00:02:59,275
DO

60
00:02:59,275 --> 00:03:03,503
WE ARE NOW JOINED BY
ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS.

61
00:03:03,503 --> 00:03:06,908
>> THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME.
I'M EXHAUSTED.

62
00:03:06,908 --> 00:03:11,399
I WAS WITH JOE BIDEN FOR THE
PAST WEEKEND, AND HE WIPED ME
OUT.

63
00:03:11,399 --> 00:03:13,764
>> SO YOU FEEL HE'S UP TO THE
JOB?

64
00:03:13,764 --> 00:03:18,351
>> DANA, I WAS JUST WITH HIM,
AND BEHIND CLOSED DOORS, HE'S A
DYNAMO.

65
00:03:18,351 --> 00:03:21,946
THIS WEEKEND, WE WENT DOWN TO
THE BORDER TOWN OF BROWNSVILLE, TEXAS,

66
00:03:21,946 --> 00:03:23,924
AND JOE WENT TO BEAST
MODE.

67
00:03:23,924 --> 00:03:27,756
HE SAID, WE GOT TO TIGHTEN THIS BORDER,

68
00:03:27,756 --> 00:03:30,844
THEN HE WENT UP TO THE
TOP OF THE BORDER WALL,

69
00:03:30,844 --> 00:03:35,813
FRONT
FLIPPED INTO THE RIO GRAND AND
CAME BACK UP WITH A FISH IN HIS
MOUTH.

70
00:03:35,813 --> 00:03:39,278
BUT YOU DIDN'T REPORT THAT
BECAUSE IT DOESN'T FIT YOUR
NARRATIVE.

71
00:03:39,278 --> 00:03:42,319
>> WITH ALL DUE RESPECT, IT
DOESN'T FIT REALITY.

72
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:44,876
>> PLEASE.
WE WERE ALL JUST WITH HIM.

73
00:03:44,876 --> 00:03:47,640
IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE US, ASK

74
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:52,372
ONE OF THE NBA'S FIERCEST PLAYERS,
DRAYMOND GREEN.

75
00:03:52,372 --> 00:03:55,860
>> LET'S GO LIVE TO SAN
FRANCISCO.
HELLO, MR. GREEN.

76
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,964
>> WHAT'S UP, DANA.

77
00:03:57,964 --> 00:04:01,182
WE TALKING ABOUT JOE BIDEN?
BECAUSE HE GOT THAT DOG IN HIM.

78
00:04:01,182 --> 00:04:03,119
>> YOU MET THE PRESIDENT?

79
00:04:03,119 --> 00:04:06,972
>> BEHIND CLOSED DOORS, HE IS
STRONG.

80
00:04:06,973 --> 00:04:09,769
MONKEY
CAN JUMP

81
00:04:09,769 --> 00:04:11,499
THAT MAN CAN JUMP SO HIGH

82
00:04:11,499 --> 00:04:15,232
THAT I SAW HIM GRAB A DOLLAR OFF THE
BACK OF A BACK BOARD AND LEAVE
SOME CHANGE.

83
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:17,538
DID YOU KNOW HE DUNKED ON ME?

84
00:04:17,538 --> 00:04:21,828
>> HE DUNKED ON YOU?
>> YEAH, IT WAS DISRESPECTFUL
TOO.

85
00:04:21,828 --> 00:04:26,028
HE WIND MILLED IN MY FACE
TALKING ABOUT, YEAH, NEXT TIME
YOUNG BLOOD.

86
00:04:26,028 --> 00:04:30,556
I WASN'T HAVING IT SO I TRY
TODAY PUNCH HIM IN THE NUTS AND
BROKE THREE FINGERS.

87
00:04:30,556 --> 00:04:32,299
YOU CAN'T MESS WITH JOE, MAN.

88
00:04:32,299 --> 00:04:34,997
>> GOVERNOR, I HAVE TO SAY WE
ALL KNOW THE STAKES HERE,

89
00:04:34,997 --> 00:04:37,804
YOU
DON'T HAVE TO EXAGGERATE TO MAKE
VOTERS FEEL BETTER.

90
00:04:37,804 --> 00:04:41,503
>> I'M NOT.
WHAT WE ARE SAYING ABOUT BIDEN
IS TRUE.

91
00:04:41,503 --> 00:04:43,952
YOU WANT TO CALL HIM?
LET'S FACE TIME HIM.

92
00:04:43,952 --> 00:04:48,003
I'LL BET HE'S PROBABLY IN THE
MIDDLE OF A BIKE RIDE.

93
00:04:48,003 --> 00:04:50,787
CAN YOU PUT MY PHONE UP ON THE
SCREEN?

94
00:04:53,193 --> 00:04:58,018
>> HEY!
HEY, ALL RIGHT!
IT'S GAVIN NEWSOM.

95
00:04:58,018 --> 00:04:59,163
>> MR. PRESIDENT?

96
00:04:59,163 --> 00:05:02,255
>> HOLD ON.
I'M JUST GOING TO TURN UP THE
VOLUME.

97
00:05:02,255 --> 00:05:04,988
JUST GOT TO FIND THE BUTTON.

98
00:05:04,988 --> 00:05:07,318
THERE WE --

99
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:10,743
>> WELL, LOOKS LIKE HE HUNG UP.

100
00:05:10,743 --> 00:05:14,611
>> WHILE THE GOVERNOR TRIES TO
GET HIM BACK ON THE LINE, LET'S
TAKE A BREAK,

101
00:05:14,611 --> 00:05:17,806
AND LIVE FROM NEW
YORK, IT'S SATURDAY NIGHT!

102
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:29,278
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, SYDNEY
SWEENEY!

103
00:07:50,572 --> 00:07:54,711
THANK

104
00:07:54,711 --> 00:07:56,422
I AM SO HAPPY TO BE HERE.

105
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:59,191
MY NAME IS SYDNEY SWEENEY.

106
00:08:01,117 --> 00:08:05,366
YOU MIGHT HAVE SEEN ME IN ANYONE
BUT YOU OR EUPHORIA.

107
00:08:06,376 --> 00:08:10,241
YOU DEFINITELY DID NOT SEE ME IN
MADAM WEB.

108
00:08:10,693 --> 00:08:15,001
BUT I DO HAVE A NEW FILM COMING
OUT CALLED IMMACULATE.

109
00:08:16,815 --> 00:08:20,211
I PLAY A NUN, SO IT'S PERFECT
CASTING.

110
00:08:20,211 --> 00:08:23,854
BUT TONIGHT, I'M EXCITED FOR
EVERYONE TO GET TO KNOW THE REAL
ME.

111
00:08:23,854 --> 00:08:27,129
I FEEL LIKE PEOPLE ONLY SEE ME
AS THE GIRL ON TV

112
00:08:27,129 --> 00:08:30,424
WHO SCREAMS,
CRIES, AND HAS SEX.

113
00:08:30,424 --> 00:08:33,607
SOMETIMES IT'S ALL THREE AT THE
SAME TIME.

114
00:08:33,607 --> 00:08:35,688
BUT I'M MORE THAN THAT.

115
00:08:35,688 --> 00:08:40,629
I'M FROM A TOWN CALLED SPOKANE
RIGHT ON THE BORDER OF
WASHINGTON AND IDAHO.

116
00:08:40,629 --> 00:08:42,678
I FEEL A BOND TO BOTH STATES,

117
00:08:42,678 --> 00:08:45,955
LIKE WHEN PEOPLE ASK WHERE ARE
YOU FROM, I SAY WASHINGTON.

118
00:08:45,955 --> 00:08:50,180
BUT WHEN PEOPLE ASK DID YOU GO
TO A TRUMP-THEMED PARTY FOR YOUR MOM,

119
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:52,885
I SAY, IDAHO.

120
00:08:53,972 --> 00:08:56,345
IT WAS ALWAYS MY DREAM TO BE AN
ACTOR.

121
00:08:56,345 --> 00:09:01,249
WHEN I WAS YOUNGER, MY PARENTS
DROVE ME FROM SPOKANE TO LOS
ANGELES JUST TO AUDITION.

122
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:05,393
THAT'S A 19-HOUR DRIVE.
AND I'M SO GRATEFUL TO THEM FOR
BELIEVING IN ME.

123
00:09:05,393 --> 00:09:07,715
AND I THINK THE REASON THEY DID

124
00:09:07,715 --> 00:09:11,390
IS BECAUSE I PRESENTED THEM WITH
A FIVE-POINT PLAN TO BREAK INTO
ACTING.

125
00:09:11,484 --> 00:09:16,063
I STILL HAVE IT.
CHECK IT OUT.

126
00:09:17,203 --> 00:09:20,599
IT SAYS, AUDITION, GET AN AGENT,
DO COMMERCIALS

127
00:09:20,599 --> 00:09:22,665
AND SHORT FILMS,
THEN GET MY SAG CARD.

128
00:09:22,665 --> 00:09:26,698
BUT IF THAT FAILED, I ALSO
PRESENTED THEM WITH A BACKUP
PLAN.

129
00:09:26,698 --> 00:09:28,106
NEXT SLIDE.

130
00:09:28,106 --> 00:09:30,997
BOOBS

131
00:09:31,773 --> 00:09:36,609
WHILE I'M UP HERE, I DO WANT TO
TALK ABOUT SOME STUFF I'VE SEEN
ABOUT ME ONLINE.

132
00:09:36,609 --> 00:09:39,952
LIKE I ONCE SAID THAT I USED TO
WORK AT UNIVERSAL STUDIOS,

133
00:09:39,952 --> 00:09:42,624
AND
SOMEONE ONLINE ACCUSED ME OF
LYING ABOUT THAT,

134
00:09:42,624 --> 00:09:46,041
WHICH IS
INSANE.
IF I DIDN'T WORK THERE,

135
00:09:46,041 --> 00:09:48,424
HOW
WOULD I KNOW ALL THE UNIVERSAL
CHARACTERS

136
00:09:48,424 --> 00:09:51,858
LIKE SHROK, THE
MUNIONS AND HARRY PORTER.

137
00:09:51,858 --> 00:09:57,371
THEN A WOMAN WENT VIRAL ON
TIKTOK BECAUSE SHE CLAIMED SHE'S
MY NUTRITIONIST.

138
00:09:57,371 --> 00:10:01,324
NEVER

139
00:10:01,324 --> 00:10:06,122
I'M IN SHAPE BECAUSE I RUN,
AVOID SUGAR, AND DO OZEMPIC.

140
00:10:06,122 --> 00:10:09,343
BUT THE CRAZIEST RUMOR IS

141
00:10:09,343 --> 00:10:14,825
THAT I WAS HAVING AN AFFAIR WITH MY
COSTAR GLENN POWELL.

142
00:10:14,825 --> 00:10:18,355
THAT'S OBVIOUSLY NOT TRUE.

143
00:10:19,127 --> 00:10:23,745
ME AND MY FIANCE PRODUCED THE
MOVIE TOGETHER, AND HE WAS THERE
THE ENTIRE SHOOT.

144
00:10:23,745 --> 00:10:27,750
AND I JUST WANT TO LET EVERYONE
KNOW THAT HE'S THE MAN OF MY DREAMS,

145
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:30,061
AND WE'RE STILL TOGETHER
AND STRONGER THAN EVER.

146
00:10:30,061 --> 00:10:34,643
HE EVEN CAME HERE TONIGHT TO
SUPPORT ME.
CAN WE CUT TO HIM?

147
00:10:39,358 --> 00:10:42,219
THAT'S NOT MY FIANCE.
HE'S IN MY DRESSING ROOM!

148
00:10:42,219 --> 00:10:45,158
WE'VE GOT A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU

149
00:10:45,158 --> 00:10:47,845
STICK

150
00:11:11,084 --> 00:11:13,304
>>> ALL RIGHT.

151
00:11:13,304 --> 00:11:15,036
IT'S MONDAY.
YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS.

152
00:11:15,036 --> 00:11:18,724
IT'S TIME TO TOUCH BASE ON OUR
LOGS OF COLD CASES.

153
00:11:18,724 --> 00:11:22,270
FIRST WE HAVE TWO NEW INTERNS
HERE FOR COLLEGE CREDIT.

154
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:24,418
EVERYBODY, LET'S WELCOME OLIVIA
AND KAIA.

155
00:11:24,418 --> 00:11:26,453
GIRLS, WHY DON'T YOU TELL US
ABOUT YOURSELVES?

156
00:11:26,453 --> 00:11:28,833
>> HI.

157
00:11:31,655 --> 00:11:36,913
>> OKAY.
ALL RIGHT.
FIRST UP, WE HAVE CASE FILE 442 --

158
00:11:36,913 --> 00:11:40,503
OH, LOOK AT THAT.
BEAUTIFUL NAKED WOMAN'S BODY
FOUND IN THE LAKE.

159
00:11:40,503 --> 00:11:43,267
>> YEAH.
THAT'S RIGHT.

160
00:11:43,267 --> 00:11:46,974
WE SUSPECT IT WAS THE HUSBAND
AND THE MOTIVE WAS AN AFFAIR.

161
00:11:46,974 --> 00:11:49,844
BUT STILL DON'T HAVE THE
EVIDENCE TO PIN IT ON HIM.

162
00:11:49,844 --> 00:11:54,990
OUR LAST LEAD WAS A PLANE TICKET
WE FOUND IN HIS TRASH, BUT THE
TRAIL'S GONE COLD.

163
00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:57,418
>> FOUND HIM.

164
00:11:57,937 --> 00:12:01,185
>> WHAT'S THAT?
>> HE'S IN DELTONA.

165
00:12:01,185 --> 00:12:05,431
>> WHAT?
HOW DID YOU FIND HIM?
>> INSTAGRAM, DUH.

166
00:12:05,431 --> 00:12:09,138
>> YEAH.
IT WAS EASY.
I LOCKED INTO MY TROLL ACCOUNT

167
00:12:09,215 --> 00:12:13,268
AND SAW WE HAD A MUTUAL, SO I
PEEPED HER IG, AND HE'S
LITERALLY ON GRID.

168
00:12:13,268 --> 00:12:15,520
THE RECEIPTS ARE ALL THERE.

169
00:12:15,584 --> 00:12:20,266
>> WELL, THAT'S VERY GOOD.
HOW DID YOU DO THAT?

170
00:12:20,266 --> 00:12:24,160
>> WE'RE 22-YEAR-OLD GIRLS IN
SITUATIONSHIPS.

171
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:28,100
WE CAN FIND OUT ANYTHING ABOUT
ANYONE WITH LITERALLY NO
INFORMATION.

172
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:31,531
>> MY SCREEN TIME IS 23 HOURS A DAY,

173
00:12:31,531 --> 00:12:35,752
AND THE OTHER HOUR, I'M
SHOPLIFTING FROM BRANDI
MELVILLE.

174
00:12:35,752 --> 00:12:39,349
>> ALL RIGHT THEN.
COOL, COOL, COOL.

175
00:12:39,349 --> 00:12:44,929
CASE CLOSED.
I GUESS WE CAN MOVE ON TO CASE
FILE 729.

176
00:12:44,929 --> 00:12:48,148
LOOK AT THAT, ANOTHER PRETTY
NAKED WOMAN.
THIS TIME IN THE WOODS.

177
00:12:48,148 --> 00:12:52,220
>> THAT'S RIGHT, BOSS.
WE SUSPECT IT WAS HER HIKING
BUDDY TONY.

178
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:56,282
HE CLAIMS HE WAS AT LUNCH WITH
HIS MOTHER AT THE TIME, BUT I
BET THAT'S BS.

179
00:12:56,282 --> 00:12:58,834
>> HOW OLD IS HE?
>> HE'S 40.

180
00:12:58,834 --> 00:13:01,400
>> SO FACEBOOK.

181
00:13:01,547 --> 00:13:05,293
>> TONY'S ON THE LAM BUT BASED
ON HIS CELL PHONE DATA,

182
00:13:05,293 --> 00:13:09,259
WE CAN
LOCATE HIM TO UTAH, ARIZONA, AND
RHODE ISLAND.

183
00:13:09,259 --> 00:13:11,327
>> FOUND HIM.

184
00:13:11,327 --> 00:13:13,564
HERE.
WE'LL SHOW YOU.

185
00:13:13,564 --> 00:13:18,346
HIS FACEBOOK IS PRIVATE, BUT HIS
MOM'S IS VERY MUCH PUBLIC.

186
00:13:18,346 --> 00:13:23,007
SHE POSTS WHAT CAN ONLY BE
DESCRIBED AS A DIARY ENTRY EVERY
DAY.

187
00:13:23,007 --> 00:13:26,888
>> ON TUESDAY, SHE WROTE I GOT
LUNCH WITH MY BEAUTIFUL SON,

188
00:13:26,888 --> 00:13:30,547
SPLIT THE FAJITAS, I LOVE MY
SON.

189
00:13:30,547 --> 00:13:34,638
>> WOW.
WE ARE REALLY BLOWING THROUGH
THESE.
ALL RIGHT.

190
00:13:34,638 --> 00:13:37,251
CASE NUMBER 904.

191
00:13:37,251 --> 00:13:40,573
ALL RIGHT.
MAN, ANOTHER GORGEOUS LADY FOUND
DEAD INSIDE THE MALL.

192
00:13:40,573 --> 00:13:43,351
>> STOP CALLING THEM GORGEOUS.

193
00:13:43,351 --> 00:13:46,483
>> I'M SORRY.
CAKED UP?

194
00:13:47,731 --> 00:13:50,055
ANYWAY,

195
00:13:50,583 --> 00:13:54,791
WE THINK IT MIGHT BE
CONNECTED TO A BURGLARY AT THE
AUNTIE ANNIE'S.

196
00:13:54,791 --> 00:13:58,371
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
I FOUND THE MANAGER'S DIGITS
SO I SHOT HIM A TEXT,

197
00:13:58,371 --> 00:14:02,465
BUT IT WASN'T
VERY BUSSEN, CAP?

198
00:14:03,405 --> 00:14:07,249
>> YOU DON'T GOT TO TALK LIKE
THEM.
>> GOT IT.

199
00:14:07,249 --> 00:14:09,310
>> FOUND THEM.

200
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:14,803
SO I DID A SEARCH,

201
00:14:14,803 --> 00:14:18,246
AND THEN I GOT BORED AND ORDERED A SHIRT ON
DEPOP,

202
00:14:18,246 --> 00:14:21,660
AND THEN DOMINOS WAS
LIKE, I MISS YOU,

203
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:23,979
AND I WAS
LIKE, FINE, I'LL GET A PIZZA.

204
00:14:23,979 --> 00:14:28,089
>> AND THEN FROM TUMBLER,
ICONIC

205
00:14:28,089 --> 00:14:30,319
FOUND HIS TWITTER -- SORRY, X --

206
00:14:30,319 --> 00:14:34,361
AND THEN A TOOK A BUZZ FEED QUIZ.
METLON
- SERIOUSLY.

207
00:14:34,361 --> 00:14:39,668
>> I TOOK THAT SAME BUZZ FEED
QUIZ.
WHY DID YOU GET ANDY COHEN?

208
00:14:39,668 --> 00:14:43,972
I AIN'T TRIPPING THOUGH.
I LIKE A LITTLE FRUIT IN MY
SALAD.

209
00:14:45,356 --> 00:14:50,017
>> SO THEN I WATCHED HIS SNAP
CHAT STORY AND IT WAS JUST HIM
WITH A BUNCH OF SOFT PRETZELS
AND CASH.

210
00:14:50,017 --> 00:14:53,251
- AND YEAH, I HAVE SCREEN SHOTS,
SO YEA.
- YEAH

211
00:14:53,251 --> 00:14:57,852
>> WELL, I THOUGHT YOU COULDN'T
TAKE SCREEN SHOTS ON SNAP CHAT,

212
00:14:57,852 --> 00:15:01,017
THAT THE WHOLE POINT IS THAT YOU
CAN SEND WHATEVER.

213
00:15:01,017 --> 00:15:05,035
>> NO.
YOU DEFINITELY CAN TAKE SCREEN
SHOTS.

214
00:15:05,035 --> 00:15:08,317
>> I HAVE TO GO.

215
00:15:09,526 --> 00:15:12,970
>> WELL, WE ARE DEFINITELY GOING
TO HAVE A MEETING FOR THAT
TOMORROW.

216
00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:15,724
ANYWAY, ON TO THE NEXT CASE.

217
00:15:15,724 --> 00:15:17,456
>> PLEASE, YOU HAVE TO HELP ME.

218
00:15:17,456 --> 00:15:21,078
>> OH, MY GOD.
LOOK AT THIS.
A GORGEOUS FULLY CLOTHED WOMAN.

219
00:15:21,078 --> 00:15:25,210
>> MY HUSBAND, I THOUGHT HE WAS
ON A BUSINESS TRIP, AND HE
HASN'T COME HOME FOR SIX WEEKS.

220
00:15:25,210 --> 00:15:27,273
>> FOUND HIM.

221
00:15:27,273 --> 00:15:30,774
GIRL, HE'S ON LOVE IS BLIND.

222
00:15:31,732 --> 00:15:35,823
>> HOW DOES THIS KEEP HAPPENING
TO ME?

223
00:15:35,823 --> 00:15:39,566
>> ALL RIGHT.
WELL, OLIVIA AND KAIA JUST
FINISHED ALL THE WORK

224
00:15:39,566 --> 00:15:41,142
WE HAD

225
00:15:41,142 --> 00:15:43,609
SO Y'ALL WANT TO PLAY UNO.

226
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:47,439

227
00:15:48,696 --> 00:15:51,901
>> NO, IT IS NOT.
I HAVE TO GO.

228
00:16:03,915 --> 00:16:06,542
CAN'T

229
00:16:06,542 --> 00:16:09,089
>> MAYBE WE SHOULD JUST GO HOME.

230
00:16:09,089 --> 00:16:10,915
>> HEY, GUYS.

231
00:16:10,915 --> 00:16:13,647
>> OH, HEY SYDNEY.
>> WHAT'S WRONG?

232
00:16:13,647 --> 00:16:16,029
>> I DON'T WANT TO BURDEN YOU ITH THIS,

233
00:16:16,029 --> 00:16:20,422
WBUT ONE OF OUR
FRIENDS JUST PASSED.

234
00:16:20,422 --> 00:16:24,642
>> THAT'S HORRIBLE.
I'M SO SORRY.
>> YEAH.

235
00:16:24,642 --> 00:16:27,898
>> DO YOU MIND IF I ASK WHAT
HAPPENED?

236
00:16:27,898 --> 00:16:30,322
>> SURE. GOD,

237
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:35,324
HE WAS ON VACATION IN
ARIZONA, AND --

238
00:16:35,324 --> 00:16:37,338
THIS IS GOING TO SOUND LIKE A JOKE --

239
00:16:37,338 --> 00:16:43,094
BUT A
DONKEY KICKED HIM IN THE NUTS SO
HARD HE FELL INTO THE GRAND
CANYON.

240
00:16:44,058 --> 00:16:47,002
>> WHAT?

241
00:16:48,224 --> 00:16:52,599
>> MAYBE LET'S NOT LAUGH ABOUT
OUR FRIEND WHO JUST DIED.

242
00:16:52,599 --> 00:16:54,770
>> WAIT, YOU'RE BEING SERIOUS?

243
00:16:54,770 --> 00:16:57,722
>> YEAH.
BUT THE IMPACT DIDN'T KILL HIM

244
00:16:57,722 --> 00:17:02,616
BECAUSE -- AND I KNOW THIS
SOUNDS SILLY, BUT HE WAS ON
ROLLER SKATES.

245
00:17:02,616 --> 00:17:05,205
>> SO HE --

246
00:17:05,205 --> 00:17:09,015
>> SHREDDED THE GRAND CANYON
LIKE A HALF PIPE, YEAH.

247
00:17:09,015 --> 00:17:10,190
>> WOW, THAT'S --

248
00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:12,267
>> BUT WHEN HE LANDED ON THE OTHER SIDE --

249
00:17:12,267 --> 00:17:14,881
AND I KNOW THIS IS
GOING TO SOUND CARTOONISH,

250
00:17:14,881 --> 00:17:19,183
BUT
HE SKADOOSH'D OFF A FAT GUY'S
STOMACH LIKE KUNG FU PANDA

251
00:17:19,183 --> 00:17:21,164
AND
EXPLODED ON SITE.

252
00:17:21,164 --> 00:17:23,433
>> YOU GUYS AREN'T MESSING WITH
ME?

253
00:17:23,433 --> 00:17:26,039

254
00:17:26,039 --> 00:17:27,375

1,500 POUNDS.

260
00:17:45,135 --> 00:17:46,209
HZ

261
00:17:46,209 --> 00:17:47,757
>> HIS DAD'S IN SHOW BUSINESS.

262
00:17:47,757 --> 00:17:49,403
>> WHO WAS HIS DAD?
>> CHEF BOYARDEE.

263
00:17:49,403 --> 00:17:53,721
>> I DON'T KNOW WHAT THIS IS,
BUT IT'S NOT OKAY TO LIE ABOUT
THIS KIND OF STUFF.

264
00:17:53,721 --> 00:17:57,632
>> IF YOU REALLY DON'T BELIEVE
US, THERE'S A VIDEO OF THE
INCIDENT.

265
00:17:57,632 --> 00:18:01,114
IT'S REALLY HARD TO WATCH.

266
00:18:02,556 --> 00:18:05,552
>> HEY, GET A VIDEO OF ME WITH
THIS DONKEY.

267
00:18:05,552 --> 00:18:08,139
>> BUTT CHEEK, GET AWAY FROM THE
EDGE.

268
00:18:08,769 --> 00:18:10,929

00:18:10,929 --> 00:18:16,436
I'M DOING IT, I'M SHREDDING THE
GRAND CANYON!

270
00:18:23,773 --> 00:18:27,132
GOLDBERG

271
00:18:27,132 --> 00:18:30,794
ROCKED

272
00:18:30,794 --> 00:18:34,060
HILARIOUS

>> FOR LIFE'S TOUGHEST MOMENTS,
CHEF BOYARDEE.

280
00:19:08,752 --> 00:19:13,356
THE CHEER SQUAD WAS A DISASTER

281
00:19:13,358 --> 00:19:13,856
WITHOUT YOU.

282
00:19:13,858 --> 00:19:15,124
>> WE WERE TRASH WITHOUT YOU.

283
00:19:15,126 --> 00:19:16,292

00:19:16,294 --> 00:19:17,560
SO HOW WAS THE GAME?

285
00:19:17,562 --> 00:19:18,227
>> OKAY.

286
00:19:18,229 --> 00:19:19,662
WE WERE LOSING BAD, BUT THEN THE

287
00:19:19,664 --> 00:19:21,497
COACH SUBBED IN A NEW PLAYER,

288
00:19:21,499 --> 00:19:22,698
AND HE WAS FIRE.

289
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:24,233
THE OTHER TEAM COMPLAINED, BUT

290
00:19:24,235 --> 00:19:25,868
THERE WAS NO RULES SAYING HE

291
00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:26,335
COULDN'T PLAY.

292
00:19:26,337 --> 00:19:28,037
>> HE TOTALLY TURNED THE GAME

293
00:19:28,039 --> 00:19:28,371
AROUND.

294
00:19:28,373 --> 00:19:30,273
EVERYONE WAS ON THEIR FEET

295
00:19:30,275 --> 00:19:31,741
CHEERING, AND HE WAS SO CUTE.

296
00:19:31,743 --> 00:19:33,242
>> WAIT, THERE'S A NEW STAR

297
00:19:33,244 --> 00:19:35,444
BASKETBALL PLAYER, AND I'M NOT

298
00:19:35,446 --> 00:19:35,912

299
00:19:35,914 --> 00:19:36,379
WHAT'S HIS NAME?

300
00:19:36,381 --> 00:19:41,784
>> AIR BUD.

301
00:19:41,786 --> 00:19:42,718
>> STEP ASIDE, LADIES.

302
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:47,156
THIS ONE IS MINE.

303
00:19:47,158 --> 00:19:50,793
>> OH, HEY, WHAT'S UP ROCHELLE?

304
00:19:50,795 --> 00:19:51,127

305
00:19:51,129 --> 00:19:54,730
HEY.

306
00:19:54,732 --> 00:19:56,632
YOU'RE BUD, RIGHT?

307
00:19:56,634 --> 00:19:59,368
I'M ROCHELLE, HEAD CHEERLEADER.

308
00:19:59,370 --> 00:20:04,640
THAT'S A COOL TONGUE.

309
00:20:04,642 --> 00:20:06,475
GOD, YOU'RE SO HAIRY.

310
00:20:06,477 --> 00:20:06,909
I LOVE THAT.

311
00:20:06,911 --> 00:20:12,949
ARE YOU ITALIAN?

312
00:20:12,951 --> 00:20:14,884
SO I HEARD YOU HAD QUITE THE

313
00:20:14,886 --> 00:20:15,785
GAME ON FRIDAY.

314
00:20:15,787 --> 00:20:17,820
I'M SO SORRY I MISSED THAT.

315
00:20:17,822 --> 00:20:20,590
I WAS ON VACATION IN THE VIRGIN

316
00:20:20,592 --> 00:20:24,860
ISLANDS WEARING A BIKINI.

317
00:20:24,862 --> 00:20:25,461
SHUT UP!

318
00:20:25,463 --> 00:20:27,663
I'M NOT EVEN THAT TAN!

319
00:20:27,665 --> 00:20:30,499
OH, MY GOD, WAIT, I LOVE YOUR

320
00:20:30,501 --> 00:20:30,866
NECKLACE.

I AM MICRO CHIPPED.

322
00:20:32,637 --> 00:20:35,171
OH, MY GOD, THAT'S SO BEAUTIFUL.

323
00:20:35,173 --> 00:20:36,305
I'M INTO POETRY TOO.

324
00:20:36,307 --> 00:20:39,475
>> HEY, ROCHELLE, HE'S A DOG.

325
00:20:39,477 --> 00:20:42,812
>> WHATEVER, TYLER.

326
00:20:42,814 --> 00:20:43,512
YOU HAD YOUR SHOT WITH ME AND

327
00:20:43,514 --> 00:20:44,013
YOU BLEW IT.

328
00:20:44,015 --> 00:20:45,781
I GAVE YOU A CHANCE TO CHANGE

329
00:20:45,783 --> 00:20:50,686
AND YOU REFUSED.

330
00:20:50,688 --> 00:20:51,687
>> HOW WAS I SUPPOSED TO GET

331
00:20:51,689 --> 00:20:52,021
TALLER?

332
00:20:52,023 --> 00:20:54,357
>> IF YOU CARED ABOUT ME, YOU

333
00:20:54,359 --> 00:20:56,158
WOULD HAVE FIGURED IT OUT.

334
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:56,892
>> WHATEVER.

335
00:20:56,894 --> 00:20:59,161
HEY, BUD, YOU WANT MY SANDWICH?

336
00:20:59,163 --> 00:21:01,030
>> SOMEONE IS HUNGRY!

337
00:21:01,032 --> 00:21:02,932
YOU'RE EATING SO FAST AND JUST

338
00:21:02,934 --> 00:21:04,967
WITH YOUR MOUTH.

339
00:21:04,969 --> 00:21:06,202
WAIT, AREN'T YOU EMBARRASSED TO

340
00:21:06,204 --> 00:21:06,936
BE EATING LIKE THAT IN FRONT OF

341
00:21:06,938 --> 00:21:10,973
A GIRL?

342
00:21:10,975 --> 00:21:11,374
I GUESS NOT.

343
00:21:11,376 --> 00:21:12,141
YOU DON'T CARE AT ALL, WHICH OF

344
00:21:12,143 --> 00:21:14,744
COURSE ONLY MAKES YOU HOTTER.

345
00:21:14,746 --> 00:21:18,014
>> ROCHELLE, ARE YOU SO BLINDED

346
00:21:18,016 --> 00:21:20,282
BY THE NEED TO BE POPULAR, YOU

347
00:21:20,284 --> 00:21:21,951
CAN'T TELL THAT THAT'S A DOG?

348
00:21:21,953 --> 00:21:23,185
>> WHATEVER, TRENT.

349
00:21:23,187 --> 00:21:24,787
YOU HAD YOUR SHOT WITH ME AND

350
00:21:24,789 --> 00:21:25,554
YOU BLEW IT.

351
00:21:25,556 --> 00:21:27,356
YOU COULDN'T BE WHAT I NEEDED

352
00:21:27,358 --> 00:21:27,757
YOU TO BE.

353
00:21:27,759 --> 00:21:30,026
>> I'M SORRY MY FAMILY ISN'T

354
00:21:30,028 --> 00:21:30,326
RICH.

355
00:21:30,328 --> 00:21:31,093
>> SO WAS I.

356
00:21:31,095 --> 00:21:33,095
>> HEY, BUD, READY FOR YOUR

357
00:21:33,097 --> 00:21:33,529
WALK?

358
00:21:33,531 --> 00:21:37,033
I GOT YOUR LITTLE GIRLFRIEND

359
00:21:37,035 --> 00:21:37,400
OUTSIDE.

360
00:21:37,402 --> 00:21:41,971
>> WAIT, YOU HAVE A GIRLFRIEND?

361
00:21:41,973 --> 00:21:44,907
WERE YOU EVER GONNA TELL ME

362
00:21:44,909 --> 00:21:45,775
ABOUT HER?

363
00:21:45,777 --> 00:21:47,143
ARE YOU JUST GOING TO SIT THERE

364
00:21:47,145 --> 00:21:48,310
AND LET ME THROW MYSELF AT YOU

365
00:21:48,312 --> 00:21:51,213
LIKE AN IDIOT?

366
00:21:51,215 --> 00:21:52,848
OH, SO NOW YOU'RE NOT GOING TO

367
00:21:52,850 --> 00:21:54,183
TALK TO ME?

368
00:21:54,185 --> 00:21:54,483
FINE.

369
00:21:54,485 --> 00:21:56,352
I HOPE YOU AND THAT SLUT ARE

370
00:21:56,354 --> 00:21:57,653
HAPPY BY THE WAY.

371
00:21:57,655 --> 00:22:01,390
I HEARD SHE EATS GRASS, BARFS,

372
00:22:01,392 --> 00:22:03,759
AND THEN EATS HER OWN BARF.

373
00:22:03,761 --> 00:22:04,760
YOU KNOW, I'VE NEVER DONE ANY OF

374
00:22:04,762 --> 00:22:08,564
THOSE THINGS.

375
00:22:08,566 --> 00:22:12,134
JUST SO YOU KNOW, I'M NOT STRICT

376
00:22:12,136 --> 00:22:13,035
ABOUT CONDOMS.

377
00:22:13,037 --> 00:22:15,237
IF YOU DON'T HAVE ONE, I'LL JUST

378
00:22:15,239 --> 00:22:18,174
SAY, BE CAREFUL, K, AND STILL GO

379
00:22:18,176 --> 00:22:19,442
ALONG WITH IT.

380
00:22:19,444 --> 00:22:21,310
NOT THAT YOU'LL EVER BENEFIT

381
00:22:21,312 --> 00:22:21,677
FROM IT.

382
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:22,812
>> ROCHELLE, HE'S A DOG.

383
00:22:22,814 --> 00:22:23,446
>> YOU CAN SAY THAT AGAIN.

384
00:22:23,448 --> 00:22:26,549
BYE, BUD.

385
00:22:26,551 --> 00:22:27,516
>> WOW.

386
00:22:27,518 --> 00:22:31,587
I'VE NEVER SEEN ROCHELLE GET

387
00:22:31,589 --> 00:22:31,921
JEALOUS.

388
00:22:31,923 --> 00:22:33,723
HEY, I'M CANDICE.

389
00:22:33,725 --> 00:22:35,991
AND JUST SO YOU KNOW, I AM

390
00:22:35,993 --> 00:22:37,326
STRICT ABOUT CONDOMS.

391
00:22:37,328 --> 00:22:43,532
I NEVER LET GUYS WEAR ONE.

392
00:23:12,362 --> 00:23:20,035
GOING TO GET MESSED UP.

393
00:23:20,037 --> 00:23:21,737
AND THE ONLY THING TOUGHER THAN

394
00:23:21,739 --> 00:23:24,006
ONE JUDGE ON THE CASE IS THREE.

395
00:23:24,008 --> 00:23:27,042
AND THE ONLY THING TOUGHER THAN

396
00:23:27,044 --> 00:23:28,077
THREE JUDGES IS TEN.

397
00:23:28,079 --> 00:23:30,412
BUT WHY STOP AT TEN WHEN YOU CAN

398
00:23:30,414 --> 00:23:31,147
HAVE 17?

399
00:23:31,149 --> 00:23:33,315
YOU'RE WATCHING BIG BENCH.

400
00:23:33,317 --> 00:23:34,216
>> ALL RISE FOR THE HONORABLE

401

00:23:37,789 --> 00:23:38,387
>> THANK YOU, BAILIFF.

403
00:23:38,389 --> 00:23:44,593
COURT IS NOW IN SESSION.

404
00:23:44,595 --> 00:23:44,894
OKAY.

00:23:44,896 --> 00:23:45,194
OKAY.

406
00:23:45,196 --> 00:23:47,596
HEY, WE DON'T ALL NEED TO BANG

407
00:23:47,598 --> 00:23:48,264
OUR GAVELS.

408
00:23:48,266 --> 00:23:49,031
THEY HEAR IT.

409
00:23:49,033 --> 00:23:50,866
WE GOT A LOT OF CASES AND EVEN

410
00:23:50,868 --> 00:23:51,734
MORE JUDGES.

411
00:23:51,736 --> 00:23:55,304
SO LET'S START.

412
00:23:55,306 --> 00:23:57,606
PLAINTIFF, PLEASE STATE YOUR

413
00:23:57,608 --> 00:23:57,907
NAME.

414
00:23:57,909 --> 00:23:58,841
>> THANK YOU, YOUR HONOR.

415
00:23:58,843 --> 00:24:01,377
MY NAME IS ASHLEY JOURNS AND I'M

416

THING ONLY, THAT MAN IS A THIEF.

418
00:24:04,816 --> 00:24:07,283
>> WHY WOULD I STEAL FROM HER?

419
00:24:07,285 --> 00:24:09,885
SHE'S BROKE AS HELL.

420
00:24:09,887 --> 00:24:10,786
>> HEY, THIS IS NOT A CIRCUS.

421
00:24:10,788 --> 00:24:12,655
THIS IS A 17-JUDGE COURTROOM.

422
00:24:12,657 --> 00:24:12,955
OKAY?

423
00:24:12,957 --> 00:24:14,156
AND IF YOU WANT TO WIN TODAY,

424
00:24:14,158 --> 00:24:15,891
YOU GOT TO GET A UNANIMOUS

425
00:24:15,893 --> 00:24:19,762
DECISION FROM EVERY JUDGE UP

HERE.

427

I'M JUDGE CARLOTTA.

428
00:24:23,534 --> 00:24:28,537
JUDGE TONKIN IS THE CRANKY ONE.

429
00:24:28,539 --> 00:24:30,439
>> I DON'T GOT TIME FOR THIS.

430
00:24:30,441 --> 00:24:31,841
>> JUDGE HUNK IS THE CUTE ONE.

431
00:24:31,843 --> 00:24:33,576
>> I AM?

432
00:24:33,578 --> 00:24:33,876
GOSH.

433
00:24:33,878 --> 00:24:34,610
>> JUDGE ALEJANDRO IS CUTE AND

434
00:24:34,612 --> 00:24:44,453
LATIN.

435
00:24:45,089 --> 00:24:47,022
>> AND JUDGE BEN, WELL, HE'S

436
00:24:47,024 --> 00:24:47,323
GAY.

437
00:24:47,325 --> 00:24:50,292
>> IMAGINE THAT, A GAY JUDGE.

438
00:24:50,294 --> 00:24:51,327
>> EXACTLY.

439
00:24:51,329 --> 00:24:54,730
NOW LET'S GET ON WITH IT.

440
00:24:54,732 --> 00:24:55,898
MS. JOURNS, YOU SAID THIS MAN

441
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:57,166
STOLE SOMETHING FROM YOU.

442
00:24:57,168 --> 00:24:59,401
WHAT DID HE STEAL?

443
00:24:59,403 --> 00:25:01,136
>> MY HEART, MY CAR, AND MY

444
00:25:01,138 --> 00:25:04,740
DISCOVERY CARD, BUT MOSTLY MY

445
00:25:04,742 --> 00:25:05,074
HEART.

446
00:25:05,076 --> 00:25:05,407
>> OKAY.

447
00:25:05,409 --> 00:25:05,708
OKAY.

448
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:06,175
THIS IS JUICY.

449
00:25:06,177 --> 00:25:08,110
NOW YOU GOT MY ATTENTION.

450
00:25:08,112 --> 00:25:10,145
>> WHAT CAN I SAY, YOUR HONOR,

451
00:25:10,147 --> 00:25:11,914
I'M A BAD BOY.

452
00:25:11,916 --> 00:25:18,921
>> OKAY, MR. PALEST ARMS ON

453
00:25:18,923 --> 00:25:19,221
EARTH.

454
00:25:19,223 --> 00:25:22,291
LET US BE THE JUDGE OF THAT.

455
00:25:22,293 --> 00:25:23,392
>> PLUS HER CAR IS WHACK AND HER

456
00:25:23,394 --> 00:25:24,827
DISCOVER CARD IS MAXED.

457
00:25:24,829 --> 00:25:27,630
THIS IS VERY UNFAIR.

458
00:25:27,632 --> 00:25:29,565
>> WHATEVER INJUSTICE YOU MAY

459
00:25:29,567 --> 00:25:31,467
FEEL THINK ABOUT WHAT I'VE GONE

460
00:25:31,469 --> 00:25:33,002
THROUGH AS A JUDGE WHO IS ALSO A

461
00:25:33,004 --> 00:25:33,569
GAY MAN.

462
00:25:33,571 --> 00:25:34,670
>> YOU'RE FINE.

463
00:25:34,672 --> 00:25:36,238
SO MS. JOURNS, WHERE DID YOU

464
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,306
MEET THIS MAN?

465
00:25:37,308 --> 00:25:40,476

I'M MICHAEL CHE.
>> I'M COLIN JOST.

801
00:40:43,670 --> 00:40:47,128
PRESIDENT BIDEN VISITED THE
SOUTHERN BORDER ON THURSDAY

802
00:40:47,128 --> 00:40:50,088
AND
WAS HORRIFIED TO DISCOVER IT IS
BEING SWARMED

803
00:40:50,088 --> 00:40:52,786
BY CRIMINALS AND
RAPISTS.

804
00:40:54,782 --> 00:41:00,683
THAT'S RIGHT, BOTH BIDEN AND
TRUMP COINCIDENTALLY VISITED THE
BORDER ON THE SAME DAY,

805
00:41:00,683 --> 00:41:04,690
WHICH
SOUNDS LIKE THE SETUP FOR THE
WEIRDEST ROM COM OF ALL TIME.

806
00:41:04,690 --> 00:41:06,620
GOT

807
00:41:06,620 --> 00:41:12,844
MY FAVORITE PART OF THE VISIT
WAS WHEN TRUMP, WHO LOOKS GOOD
BEHIND BARS BY THE WAY,

808
00:41:12,844 --> 00:41:17,490
FINALLY
CAME FACE TO FACE WITH HIS SWORN
ENEMIES, THE MIGRANTS,

809
00:41:17,490 --> 00:41:21,023
AND HE
HAD A PRETTY HARSH MESSAGE FOR
THEM.
TAKE A LOOK.

810
00:41:25,038 --> 00:41:28,275
>> THEY LIKE TRUMP, CAN YOU
BELIEVE IT?

811
00:41:28,417 --> 00:41:33,157
>> NO, I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.
THE MIGRANTS DON'T LIKE YOU.

812
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:36,149
THEY JUST WALKED A THOUSAND
MILES TO GET TO THE EDGE OF THIS RIVER,

813
00:41:36,149 --> 00:41:41,573
AND THEY'RE PROBABLY
THINKING IS THAT GUY IN A TRUMP
COSTUME WAVING US INTO THE
COUNTRY?

814
00:41:41,869 --> 00:41:46,474
>> MITCH McCONNELL SEEN HERE
CATCHING UP ON NEWS FROM THE MIDDLE EAST,

815
00:41:46,474 --> 00:41:48,979
ANNOUNCED HE WILL

816
00:41:48,979 --> 00:41:53,376
ANNOUNCED HE WILL
STEP DOWN AS THE REPUBLICAN
LEADER IN THE SENATE.

817
00:41:53,376 --> 00:41:56,049
McCONNELL HAS LEADER FOR ALMOST 20 YEARS,

818
00:41:56,049 --> 00:41:58,975
BUT HE FIRST GOT
INVOLVED IN POLITICS BACK IN 1968

819
00:41:58,975 --> 00:42:02,249
WHEN HE LOST A FIDDLE
CONTEST TO THE DEVIL.

820
00:42:02,573 --> 00:42:07,681
MANY ARE SAYING HE IS LEAVING
BECAUSE OF HIS BAD RELATIONSHIP
WITH DONALD TRUMP.

821
00:42:07,681 --> 00:42:10,899
COME ON, JUST BECAUSE YOU HATE
SOMEBODY DOESN'T MEAN

822
00:42:10,899 --> 00:42:15,591
YOU CAN'T
STILL HAVE A VERY SUCCESSFUL
WORKING RELATIONSHIP WITH THEM.

823
00:42:23,485 --> 00:42:26,683
>> I ALMOST FEEL LIKE THAT WAS
ABOUT ME.

824
00:42:26,683 --> 00:42:28,866
MITCH McCONNELL,

825

STEP
IN NOVEMBER.

828
00:42:43,296 --> 00:42:46,561
HE'LL BE REPLACE TD BY THE
CURRENT NUMBER TWO REPUBLICAN IN THE SENATE,

829
00:42:46,561 --> 00:42:49,970
A FROZEN EMBRYO
HOLDING AN ASSAULT RIFLE.

MITCH McCONNELL, SEEN HERE AFTER

RETIREMENT,

832
00:43:04,422 --> 00:43:07,570

833
00:43:07,570 --> 00:43:12,540
SEEN
HERE WATCHING A SINGLE MOTHER
SELL HER BLOOD FOR DIAPER MONEY.

834
00:43:14,916 --> 00:43:19,675

SENATOR CINDY HYDE SMITH

835
00:43:19,675 --> 00:43:23,917
BLOCKED
A BILL THAT WOULD PROTECT ACCESS
TO IN VITRO VERTLIZATION

836
00:43:23,917 --> 00:43:27,038
BECAUSE
AS THEY SAY IN MISSISSIPPI, IF
YOU'RE HAVING TROUBLE CONCEIVING,

837
00:43:27,038 --> 00:43:29,699
JUST TRY WITH A
DIFFERENT COUSIN.

838
00:43:31,432 --> 00:43:34,547
AFTER NIKKI HALEY'S POOR SHOWING
IN MICHIGAN,

839
00:43:34,547 --> 00:43:37,501
PRESSURE IS
MOUNTING FOR HER TO DROP OUT OF THE RACE,

840
00:43:37,501 --> 00:43:41,104
BUT MOSTLY BECAUSE THE
DISHES ARE PILING UP AT HOME.

841
00:43:44,865 --> 00:43:47,193
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.

842
00:43:47,193 --> 00:43:51,373
>> PRESIDENT BIDEN WENT TO
WALTER REID MEDICAL CENTER FOR
HIS ANNUAL PHYSICAL.

843
00:43:51,373 --> 00:43:54,426
DOCTORS SAID BIDEN WAS FIT AS A FIDDLE

844
00:43:54,426 --> 00:43:58,918
IN THAT HE'S OLD-TIMEY
AND HELD TOGETHER BY STRINGS.

845
00:44:00,087 --> 00:44:02,930
>> IN AN INTERVIEW, SENATOR MITT ROMNEY SAID

846
00:44:02,930 --> 00:44:05,876
HE WILL NOT VOTE FOR
DONALD TRUMP OVER JOE BIDEN.

847
00:44:05,876 --> 00:44:09,233
SOME OF YOU MAY REMEMBER MITT
ROMNEY.

848
00:44:14,220 --> 00:44:15,709
>> WELL, GUYS, MY PRAYERS HAVE

849
00:44:15,711 --> 00:44:18,211
BEEN ANSWERED.

850
00:44:18,213 --> 00:44:19,679
ABC HAS OFFICIALLY ANNOUNCED

CONFIDENCE AT ANY AGE IS A WOMAN

00:44:28,790 --> 00:44:30,557
THAT'S AGING GRACEFULLY.

856
00:44:30,559 --> 00:44:31,224

857
00:44:31,226 --> 00:44:31,591

THAT'S RIGHT, COLIN.

859
00:44:32,494 --> 00:44:34,294
I'M NOT AFRAID TO SAY I'M A

860
00:44:34,296 --> 00:44:36,696
LITTLE OLDER, A LITTLE WISER,

BECAUSE I ALWAYS SAY A WOMAN'S

AGE IS LIKE A SPEED LIMIT,

AND THEY CAME FROM A GUY, SO

942
00:46:58,206 --> 00:47:00,406

943
00:47:00,408 --> 00:47:02,442

944
00:47:02,444 --> 00:47:04,978
I HAVE TO SAY FOR SOMEONE WHO'S

EYES.

953
00:47:16,057 --> 00:47:17,824

THAT'S GONNA HAPPEN.

1120
00:54:27,832 --> 00:54:29,164
>> I'M SO SORRY.

1121
00:54:29,166 --> 00:54:32,835
I HAD TO RUN TO THE BANK.

1122
00:54:32,837 --> 00:54:34,470
HERE'S YOUR TIP, NEW GIRL.

1123
00:54:34,472 --> 00:54:35,070
DAMN SHE FINE.

1124
00:54:35,072 --> 00:54:36,505
>> THAT IS INSANE.

1125
00:54:36,507 --> 00:54:38,140
I SERVED THAT GUY LAST WEEK.

1126
00:54:38,142 --> 00:54:40,642
WHEN I BROUGHT THE CHECK, HE

1127
00:54:40,644 --> 00:54:42,511
PATTED HIS POCKETS AND SAID,

1128
00:54:42,513 --> 00:54:43,846
SORRY, I JUST GOT LAID OFF.

1129
00:54:43,848 --> 00:54:45,814
>> WHEN I SERVED HIM, HE SAID

1130
00:54:45,816 --> 00:54:47,783
ARE THERE ANY LADIES WHO WORK

1131
00:54:47,785 --> 00:54:48,183
HERE?

1132
00:54:48,185 --> 00:54:51,020
>> OKAY, GUYS, RAZZ THE NEW

1133
00:54:51,022 --> 00:54:51,320
GIRL.

1134
00:54:51,322 --> 00:54:53,088
BUT HONESTLY, I THINK IT'S JUST

1135
00:54:53,090 --> 00:54:54,456
ABOUT GREAT SERVICE.

1136
00:54:54,458 --> 00:54:54,757
WATCH.

1137
00:54:54,759 --> 00:54:55,591
I'M GOING TO GO DEAL WITH TABLE

1138
00:54:55,593 --> 00:55:00,429
EIGHT.

1139
00:55:00,431 --> 00:55:01,196
HI, BOYS.

1140
00:55:01,198 --> 00:55:02,865
WHO WANTS A REFILL?

1141
00:55:02,867 --> 00:55:05,667
>> US, US, WE DO!

1142
00:55:05,669 --> 00:55:08,604
>> COMING RIGHT UP.

1143
00:55:08,606 --> 00:55:09,538
OH, MY GOSH.

1144
00:55:09,540 --> 00:55:11,373
I AM SUCH A KLUTZ.

1145
00:55:11,375 --> 00:55:12,408
I AM SO SORRY.

1146
00:55:12,410 --> 00:55:12,841
>> IT'S OKAY.

1147
00:55:12,843 --> 00:55:16,111
ANYTHING YOU DO IS OKAY.

1148
00:55:16,113 --> 00:55:19,114
>> OH, IT LOOKS LIKE THERE'S A

1149
00:55:19,116 --> 00:55:20,582
LITTLE BEER LEFT IN THE PITCHER.

1150
00:55:20,584 --> 00:55:22,084
WHO WANTS SOME?

1151
00:55:22,086 --> 00:55:22,351
YOU?

1152
00:55:22,353 --> 00:55:22,951
>> OH, WHAT THE HECK.

1153
00:55:22,953 --> 00:55:23,252
SURE.

1154
00:55:23,254 --> 00:55:26,355
>> OKAY.

1155
00:55:26,357 --> 00:55:29,224
>> OH, AWESOME.

1156
00:55:29,226 --> 00:55:33,529
THE BEST PART IS I'VE BEEN SOBER

1157
00:55:33,531 --> 00:55:34,997
FOR 22 YEARS, AND THAT'S OVER

1158
00:55:34,999 --> 00:55:35,531
NOW.

1159
00:55:35,533 --> 00:55:36,932
>> HEY, CAN WE BUY YOU A CAR OR

1160
00:55:36,934 --> 00:55:39,401
SOMETHING?

1161
00:55:39,403 --> 00:55:44,907
>> YOU GUYS ARE HILARIOUS.

1162
00:55:44,909 --> 00:55:45,174
SEE.

1163
00:55:45,176 --> 00:55:46,275
WAS THAT SO HARD?

1164
00:55:46,277 --> 00:55:48,310
>> YOU SPILLED ALL OVER THEM AND

1165
00:55:48,312 --> 00:55:49,511
MADE ONE GUY RELAPSE.

1166
00:55:49,513 --> 00:55:50,079
>> THEY JUST LIKE YOU.

1167
00:55:50,081 --> 00:55:54,149
WATCH.

1168
00:55:54,151 --> 00:55:55,984
HEY, GUYS, I JUST WANTED TO

1169
00:55:55,986 --> 00:55:57,653
OFFER YOU A FREE ROUND.

1170
00:55:57,655 --> 00:55:59,721
>> I'M GOING TO STOP YOU RIGHT

1171
00:55:59,723 --> 00:56:00,055
THERE.

1172
00:56:00,057 --> 00:56:02,491
I DON'T WANT TO SEE YOU.

1173
00:56:02,493 --> 00:56:03,425
I DON'T WANT TO KNOW YOU.

1174
00:56:03,427 --> 00:56:06,228
I WANT OTHER GIRL.

1175
00:56:06,230 --> 00:56:07,329
>> AND I'LL TAKE THAT.

1176
00:56:07,331 --> 00:56:11,133
>> GREAT.

1177
00:56:11,135 --> 00:56:12,601
SO, YEAH, IT WAS A LITTLE

1178
00:56:12,603 --> 00:56:13,469
DIFFERENT FOR ME.

1179
00:56:13,471 --> 00:56:13,802
>> YEAH.

1180
00:56:13,804 --> 00:56:14,136
EXACTLY.

1181
00:56:14,138 --> 00:56:17,473
WATCH THIS.

1182
00:56:17,475 --> 00:56:17,973
HELLO, MY GUYS.

1183
00:56:17,975 --> 00:56:18,273
>> NO!

1184
00:56:18,275 --> 00:56:22,111
>> OF COURSE.

1185
00:56:22,113 --> 00:56:22,878
>> SEE.

1186
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:25,614
NO OFFENSE, TINA, BUT YOU'RE

1187
00:56:25,616 --> 00:56:27,116
MAKING US FEEL BAD AND YOU'RE

1188
00:56:27,118 --> 00:56:30,252
TAKING ALL OUR TIPS.

1189
00:56:30,254 --> 00:56:31,553
>> YEAH.

1190
00:56:32,256 --> 00:56:33,288
MAYBE HOOTERS ISN'T THE RIGHT

1191
00:56:33,290 --> 00:56:33,789
PLACE FOR YOU.

1192
00:56:33,791 --> 00:56:34,289
>> OH.

1193
00:56:34,291 --> 00:56:37,292
YOU KNOW, I ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT

1194
00:56:37,294 --> 00:56:38,660
THIS PLACE WAS THE ONE PLACE I

1195
00:56:38,662 --> 00:56:39,661
WOULD FEEL AT HOME.

1196
00:56:39,663 --> 00:56:41,864
I'VE TRIED TO WORK AT OTHER

1197
00:56:41,866 --> 00:56:42,598
JOBS, AND I CAN'T.

1198
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:44,900
I WORKED AT AN AIRPORT, NO

1199
00:56:44,902 --> 00:56:45,801
PLANES TOOK OFF.

1200
00:56:45,803 --> 00:56:46,568
I WAS A CROSSING GUARD,

1201
00:56:46,570 --> 00:56:49,238
THOUSANDS DIED.

1202
00:56:49,240 --> 00:56:50,806
BUT IF YOU DON'T THINK I BELONG

1203
00:56:50,808 --> 00:56:55,144
AT HOOTERS, I'LL GO.

1204
00:56:55,146 --> 00:56:55,677
>> WAIT!

1205
00:56:55,679 --> 00:56:59,281
>> OH, MY GOD, HOOTERS MASCOT

1206
00:56:59,283 --> 00:57:00,149
HOOTER THE OWL?

1207
00:57:00,151 --> 00:57:01,049
>> THAT'S ME.

1208
00:57:01,051 --> 00:57:03,452
AND I CAME TO SAY YOU CAN'T

1209
00:57:03,454 --> 00:57:04,119
LEAVE.

1210
00:57:04,121 --> 00:57:07,422
YOU ARE MY HARRY POTTER, AND

1211
00:57:07,424 --> 00:57:10,092
THIS IS YOUR HOGWARTS.

1212
00:57:10,094 --> 00:57:10,692
SO PLEASE STAY.

1213
00:57:10,694 --> 00:57:14,029
>> IF YOU REALLY WANT ME TO.

1214
00:57:14,031 --> 00:57:14,329
OKAY.

1215
00:57:14,331 --> 00:57:15,397
>> THANK YOU.

1216
00:57:15,399 --> 00:57:16,698
>> AND WHAT ABOUT US?

1217
00:57:16,700 --> 00:57:19,034
>> I DON'T CARE.

1218
00:57:19,036 --> 00:57:20,335
NOW, I MUST GO.

1219
00:57:20,337 --> 00:57:22,237
I HAVE A FUNERAL TO ATTEND.

1220
00:57:22,239 --> 00:57:23,438

1222

I'M VERY SAD.

1223
00:57:29,046 --> 00:57:31,413
SO IF SOMEONE COULD SHOW ME

1224
00:57:31,415 --> 00:57:32,381
THEIR BREASTS.

1225
00:57:32,383 --> 00:57:33,248
>> I'LL DO IT.

1226
00:57:33,250 --> 00:57:34,816
>> I'LL JUST LEAVE.

1227

ENJOY YOUR MEAL.

1456
01:06:51,258 --> 01:06:52,757
WELL, THAT OUGHT TO TAKE CARE OF

1457
01:06:52,759 --> 01:06:53,057
THAT.

1458
01:06:53,059 --> 01:06:53,992
>> WOW.

1459
01:06:53,994 --> 01:06:55,093
THAT SURE WAS SOMETHING.

1460
01:06:55,095 --> 01:06:55,493
>> YEP.

1461
01:06:55,495 --> 01:06:57,562
NOTHING QUIETS UP A GROUP OF

1462
01:06:57,564 --> 01:07:00,098
WOMEN QUITE LIKE A REMINDER OF

1463
01:07:00,100 --> 01:07:01,800
THEIR MOTHER'S HUMANITY.

1464
01:07:01,802 --> 01:07:04,669
>> NICE JOB, HONEY.

1465
01:07:04,671 --> 01:07:06,438
NOW WE CAN GET BACK TO DATE

1466
01:07:06,440 --> 01:07:06,738

1467
01:07:06,740 --> 01:07:08,907

1468
01:07:08,909 --> 01:07:09,374
WORK TODAY?

1469
01:07:09,376 --> 01:07:10,074
>> YEAH.

1470
01:07:10,076 --> 01:07:11,976
I CHEATED ON YOU WITH MY BOSS,

1471
01:07:11,978 --> 01:07:13,711
AND I THINK WE SHOULD BREAK UP.

1472
01:07:13,713 --> 01:07:16,114
>> HEY, BABY CAKES, WANT TO GET

1473
01:07:16,116 --> 01:07:16,881

1474
01:07:16,883 --> 01:07:17,215
>> YEAH.

1475
01:07:17,217 --> 01:07:19,117
SORRY.

1476
01:07:19,119 --> 01:07:23,888
>> AW, MAN.

1477
01:07:23,890 --> 01:07:26,491
>> HEY, MAN, ARE YOU OKAY?

1478
01:07:26,493 --> 01:07:29,561
>> I'LL BE ALL RIGHT.

1479
01:07:29,563 --> 01:07:32,230
THANKS FOR CHECKING IN ON ME,

1480
01:07:32,232 --> 01:07:32,530
GUYS.

1481
01:07:32,532 --> 01:07:34,098
IT REALLY MEANS A LOT THAT YOU

1482
01:07:34,100 --> 01:07:35,967
CARE SO MUCH ABOUT ME.

1483
01:07:35,969 --> 01:07:37,235
OH, THEY'RE GONE.

1484
01:07:37,237 --> 01:07:42,040
GOD, I GOT TO STOP DOING THAT.
