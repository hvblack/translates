1
00:00:08,246 --> 00:00:12,686
>>> GOOD EVENING
GOOD EVENING I'M JUDGE JEANINE PIRRO,

2
00:00:12,686 --> 00:00:15,151
ALSO
IF ANYONE WATCHING IS WEARING A
HEARIN AID,

3
00:00:15,151 --> 00:00:17,492
SORRY YOU'RE DEAD NOW

4
00:00:17,492 --> 00:00:22,627
OUR TOP STORY, KYLE RITTENHOUSE,
ACQUITTED OF ALL CHARGES

5
00:00:22,627 --> 00:00:27,056
THAT LOVEABLE SCAMP, WAS PUT
THROUGH A NIGHTMARE OF A TRIAL

6
00:00:27,056 --> 00:00:30,843
JUST FOR DOING THE BRAVEST THING
ANY AMERICAN CAN DO,

7
00:00:30,843 --> 00:00:35,361
PROTECTING
AN EMPTY CAR LOT IN SOMEONE
ELSE'S TOWN.

8
00:00:35,361 --> 00:00:40,424
ON TO OUR NEXT GUEST
HE'S AS IMPARTIAL AS A DANCE MAN,

9
00:00:40,424 --> 00:00:45,111
JUDGE BRUCE SCHRODER

10
00:00:45,111 --> 00:00:50,169
>> THANK YOU

11
00:00:50,169 --> 00:00:53,456
AKNOWLEDGE

12
00:00:53,456 --> 00:00:57,132
YOU MAY REMEMBER THAT I WAS IN
CHARGE OF INVESTIGATING

13
00:00:57,132 --> 00:00:59,983
ROBERT
DURST FOR MURDER BACK IN 1983,

14
00:00:59,983 --> 00:01:05,650
WELL, FOLKS, 30 YEARS AND ONE
ADDITIONAL MURDER LATER, WE GOT
HIM.

15
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:11,402
NOW, IF I MAY SAY, JUDGE TO
JUDGE,
WHAT TURNED ME ON THE MOST

16
00:01:11,402 --> 00:01:14,847
WAS HOW YOU RULED THAT
COURTROOM WITH AN IRON FIST.

17
00:01:14,847 --> 00:01:17,017
TELL US HOW YOU DID IT

18
00:01:17,017 --> 00:01:19,763
>> WELL, IT WAS ALL STANDARD
PROCEDURE.

19
00:01:19,763 --> 00:01:24,516
THAT'S WHY I ORDERED THAT THE
PROSECUTION NOT USE THE WORD
"VICTIMS."

20
00:01:24,516 --> 00:01:26,305
THEY WERE RIOTERS,

21
00:01:26,305 --> 00:01:30,437
AND THEY WEREN'T SHOT, THEY WERE
GADOINKED.

22
00:01:30,437 --> 00:01:37,147
BUT THAT DID NOT GIVE MY CLIENT
AN UNFAIR ADVANTAGE IN ANY WAY

23
00:01:37,147 --> 00:01:40,615
>> NOW, YOU SAID MY CLIENT, DO
YOU MEAN THE DEFENDANT

24
00:01:40,615 --> 00:01:45,226
>> OH, YES
SURE
I KEEP DOING THAT.

25
00:01:45,226 --> 00:01:48,522
>> WELL, YOU DO YOU, JUDGE
YOU DO YOU

26
00:01:48,522 --> 00:01:50,129
THANKS FOR COMING.

27
00:01:50,129 --> 00:01:55,600
PREDICTABLY, THE LOONEY LIBERAL
OUTRAGE MACHINE'S IN OVERDRIVE,

28
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,927
AND YOU KNOW HOW MUCH WE LOVE
LIBERAL TEARS AROUND HERE,

29
00:01:58,927 --> 00:02:02,121
SO I
DECIDED TO INVITE TWO OF THEM
HERE TONIGHT

30
00:02:02,121 --> 00:02:07,235
PLEASE WELCOME LEGAL ANALYST FOR
NASTY NPR SANDRA CUMMINGS

31
00:02:07,235 --> 00:02:11,194
AND
PROFESSOR OF LAW AT HOWARD
UNIVERSITY, DANIEL FIELDS,

32
00:02:11,194 --> 00:02:12,629
WELCOME TO THE SHOW.

33
00:02:12,629 --> 00:02:16,050
>> WE WERE TOLD YOU INVITED US
IN THE INTEREST OF FAIRNESS.

34
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:19,091
>> AND YOU FELL FOR IT, THAT'S
ON YOU DUMB DUMBS.

35
00:02:19,091 --> 00:02:22,957
SANDRA, WERE YOU SURPRISED BY
YESTERDAY'S VERDICT?

36
00:02:22,957 --> 00:02:26,657
>> SURPRISED THAT HE WAS
EXONERATED ON ALL CHARGES?

37
00:02:26,657 --> 00:02:30,733
YEAH, THAT'S PUTTING IT MILDLY
I WAS SHOCKED.

38
00:02:30,733 --> 00:02:33,027
>> YOU WERE?
BECAUSE I WASN'T

39
00:02:33,027 --> 00:02:35,647
>> I HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING
LIKE IT BEFORE

40
00:02:35,647 --> 00:02:37,890
>> OH I HAVE, MANY TIMES

41
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:41,536
>> I MEAN, THIS IS NOT WHO WE
ARE.

42
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:44,212
>> I FEEL LIKE IT KIND OF IS

43
00:02:44,212 --> 00:02:47,665
>> AND ALL THIS DOES IS SEND A
MESSAGE THAT ANY AMERICAN

44
00:02:47,665 --> 00:02:50,697
CAN JUST PROWL THE STREETS WITH AN
AK-47.

45
00:02:50,697 --> 00:02:52,832
>> ANY AMERICAN?

46
00:02:52,832 --> 00:02:56,400
I THINK YOU'RE MISSING A KEYWORD
THERE.

47
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,269
>> ALL WE CAN HOPE FOR IS THAT
AT THIS POINT,

48
00:02:59,269 --> 00:03:03,028
THIS WILL BE A CALL
TO FINALLY CHANGE THE
SYSTEM

49
00:03:03,028 --> 00:03:07,252
>> AND THAT CALL WILL GO TO
VOICE MAIL AND THAT INBOX IS
FULL, OKAY

50
00:03:07,252 --> 00:03:09,850
>> WOW, VERY INTERESTING

51
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:13,763
WELL, YOUR SEGMENT IS OVER, AND
MY MUG IS EMPTY,

52
00:03:13,764 --> 00:03:14,806
TEARS

53
00:03:14,806 --> 00:03:16,579
SO YOU GOT TO
GO

54
00:03:16,579 --> 00:03:19,248
NOW ON A MORE INSPIRING NOTE,

55
00:03:19,248 --> 00:03:21,928
KEVIN McCARTHY ROCKED THE HOUSE DOWN

56
00:03:21,928 --> 00:03:26,939
WITH HIS AWE INSPIRIN
EIGHT-HOUR TIRADE AGAINST THE
BUILD BACK BETTER BILL,

57
00:03:26,939 --> 00:03:30,725
DEMONSTRATING WHY KEEPING THE
FILIBUSTER IS VITAL TO OUR
DEMOCRACY.

58
00:03:30,725 --> 00:03:34,991
LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT HOUR SIX OF
HIS RHETORICAL MASTERPIECE

59
00:03:34,991 --> 00:03:39,071
>> DEMOCRATS ARE TRYING TO FLIP
THIS THING AROUND.

60
00:03:39,728 --> 00:03:41,581
EXCUSE ME.

61
00:03:41,581 --> 00:03:44,614
DEMOCRATS ARE TRYING TO FLIP
THIS AROUND.

62
00:03:45,514 --> 00:03:46,888
EXCUSE ME.

63
00:03:46,888 --> 00:03:48,179
FLIP IT AROUND

64
00:03:48,179 --> 00:03:49,933
WHOOPS

65
00:03:49,933 --> 00:03:51,802
I COULD DO IT BEFORE

66
00:03:51,802 --> 00:03:57,156
>> AND THAT BRAVE MAN STOPPED
THE BUILD BACK BETTER BILL FROM BEING PASSED

67
00:03:57,156 --> 00:04:00,152
UNTIL THE NEXT DAY
WHEN IT PASSED IN TWO MINUTES.

68
00:04:00,152 --> 00:04:04,033
MEANWHILE, WHAT WAS PRESIDENT
BRANDON DOING?

69
00:04:04,033 --> 00:04:09,536
GETTING SOCIALIZED BUTT PLAGUE
PAID FOR BY YOUR TAX DOLLARS

70
00:04:09,536 --> 00:04:15,711
DEMOCRATS ARE PRAISING PASSED
OUT JOE FOR HIS BIG DEAL
INFRASTRUCTURE BILL.

71
00:04:15,711 --> 00:04:19,468
BUT WHERE'S THE THANKS FOR THE
REAL MUCHACHO WHO GOT THIS DONE?

72
00:04:19,468 --> 00:04:23,001
PLEASE WELCOME THIS PEOPLE'S
SEXIEST MAN ALIVE,

73
00:04:23,001 --> 00:04:25,890
PRESIDENT
DONALD J. TRUMP!

74
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:29,024
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH, JENNIE
IT'S WONDERFUL TO BE HERE.

75
00:04:29,024 --> 00:04:33,211
>> WELL, I KNOW YOU HAVE A LOT
OF THOUGHTS ON THE INFRASTRUCTURE BILL,

76
00:04:33,211 --> 00:04:35,566
SO IF IT'S
OKAY, I'M JUST GOING TO LET YOU RIP

77
00:04:35,566 --> 00:04:39,871
WHILE I SIT HERE AND GET
ABSOLUTELY ROCK HARD

78
00:04:39,871 --> 00:04:42,826
>> YOU KNOW, I'M GLAD YOU
BROUGHT THAT UP BECAUSE THAT TERRIBLE BILL,

79
00:04:42,826 --> 00:04:46,562
YOU KNOW WHAT,
THE TRUTH IS NOBODY DID MORE FOR
THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAN ME,

80
00:04:46,562 --> 00:04:51,005
AND MEEPLE IS SAYING,
AND MEEPLE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE
ME

81
00:04:51,005 --> 00:04:55,014
THEY'RE SAYING, OKAY, BUILD IT
BACK EVEN A LITTLE BIT BETTER,

82
00:04:55,014 --> 00:04:58,216
BECAUSE I DID, WALL,
OKAY
BIG BEAUTIFUL WALL

83
00:04:58,216 --> 00:05:03,833
OKAY IT'S NOT JUST WALL.
WHEN YOU PUT WALL IN A GRASSY
FIELD, FRANKLY, THAT'S ROAD.

84
00:05:03,833 --> 00:05:09,193
AND YOU KNOW WHAT IF YOU TAKE
WALL AND LAY IT ACROSS THE
RIVER, FRANKLY, WE'RE DOING
BRIDGE

85
00:05:09,193 --> 00:05:12,782
>> WOW, I AM EDGING.

86
00:05:12,782 --> 00:05:16,083
>> YOU KNOW WHAT
CAN I JUST SAY 60 SECONDS ON THE
CLOCK, PLEASE?

87
00:05:16,083 --> 00:05:20,181
YOU KNOW WHAT?
SLEEPY JOE BIDEN IS SUCH A
DISASTER

88
00:05:20,181 --> 00:05:24,372
WE'RE COMING BACK.

89
00:05:24,372 --> 00:05:27,730
EVERYBODY LOVES THE REBOOT

90
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:31,555
JUST LIKE I-CARLY.

91
00:05:31,555 --> 00:05:35,797
JOE BIDEN TRIED TO REBOOT OBAMA,

92
00:05:35,797 --> 00:05:39,620
AND IT FLOPPED JUST LIKE THE
FEMALE "GHOSTBUSTERS."

93
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:44,645
WHY DID THEY REBOOT "GOSSIP
GIRL."

94
00:05:44,645 --> 00:05:51,019
YOU CAN'T MATCH IT

95
00:05:51,019 --> 00:05:54,823
YOU KNOW WHAT?
BAD FRIEND

96
00:05:54,823 --> 00:05:59,577
THIS WAS TRUE.
SOMETIMES SERENA WAS THE BAD
FRIEND TO BLARE.

97
00:06:00,331 --> 00:06:05,547
>> OH, I HOPE THIS NEVER ENDS.

98
00:06:05,548 --> 00:06:07,815
ANOTHER

99
00:06:07,815 --> 00:06:11,760
>> WHY DON'T WE TRY A WORD
SEARCH THIS TIME
I'D LOVE IT IF IT WAS WORD
SEARCH

100
00:06:11,761 --> 00:06:13,736
LOVE

101
00:06:13,736 --> 00:06:18,910
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
I WAS TREATED VERY UNFAIRLY BY
CHRIS CRISTIE.

102
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:23,760
HE WAS VERY NASTY, AND HE SAID
VERY NASTY THINGS ABOUT ME ON
BILL MAHR.

103
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:26,425
WE LOVE HIM.
HE'S A WONDERFUL PERSON.

104
00:06:26,425 --> 00:06:29,123
BUT I DON'T THINK WE LOVE HIM A
LOT.
WE HATE HIM A LOT.

105
00:06:29,124 --> 00:06:32,626
MAN
INTERVIEW

106
00:06:32,626 --> 00:06:37,172
SIT
WATCH BILL
NEW RULES

107
00:06:37,172 --> 00:06:41,498
AND YOU KNOW WHAT, SPEAKING OF
NEW RULES, DUA LIPA IS ONE OF OUR BEST SINGERS,

108
00:06:41,499 --> 00:06:45,037
SING

109
00:06:45,037 --> 00:06:47,958
AND HER
HUSBAND, YOU KNOW WHAT, IS NOT
VERY ATTRACTIVE.

110
00:06:47,958 --> 00:06:52,877
IT'S TERRIBLE WHAT THEY'RE DOING
WITH DUA LIPA'S HUSBAND NOT
BEING VERY ATTRACTIVE.

111
00:06:52,877 --> 00:06:54,600
WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT
IT

112
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:58,582
SHE'S TALL, SHE'S ARMENIAN,
WHICH IS BASICALLY WHITE

113
00:06:59,677 --> 00:07:05,005
AND YOU KNOW WHO ELSE IS WHITE
BOB THE BUILDER ERBUILDER
BUILD THE WALL

114
00:07:05,369 --> 00:07:09,526
WORRIES
BINGO, BABY.

115
00:07:09,526 --> 00:07:13,400
AND LIVE FROM NEW YORK, IT'S
SATURDAY NIGHT.

116
00:09:25,011 --> 00:09:29,760
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, SIMU LIU

117
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:49,217
>> THANK YOU
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

118
00:09:49,217 --> 00:09:52,607
MY NAME IS SIMU LIU, AND SOME OF YOU --

119
00:09:54,199 --> 00:09:58,975
SOME OF YOU MIGHT KNOW ME
FROM MARVEL'
"SHANG-CHI AND THE LEGEND OF THE
10 RINGS."

120
00:09:58,975 --> 00:10:04,353
I AM OFFICIALLY MARVEL'S FIRST
OPENLY
CHINESE SUPERHERO.

121
00:10:04,353 --> 00:10:08,526
I'M ALSO THE FIRST CHINESE HOST ON "SNL,"

122
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:13,639
TO BE THE FOURTH
CHINESE HOST ON "SNL."

123
00:10:13,639 --> 00:10:15,522
I'M ACTUALLY CHINESE CANADIAN,

124
00:10:15,522 --> 00:10:18,481
AND I AM SO HAPPY TO BE HERE FOR
THE THANKSGIVING SHOW.

125
00:10:18,481 --> 00:10:21,442
NOW, IN CANADA, THANKSGIVING IS
ACTUALLY IN OCTOBER,

126
00:10:21,442 --> 00:10:23,387
AND MARKS
THE START OF THE HARVEST SEASON.

127
00:10:23,387 --> 00:10:25,731
AND HERE IN AMERICA, THINGS ARE
A LITTLE DIFFERENT

128
00:10:25,731 --> 00:10:30,361
IT'S IN NOVEMBER, AND IT MARKS
THE START OF BLACK FRIDAY WEEK
ON AMAZON PRIME.

129
00:10:30,361 --> 00:10:33,251
BUT I DO HAVE A LOT TO BE
THANKFUL FOR

130
00:10:33,251 --> 00:10:36,997
NOW, A LOT OF PEOPLE ASKED ME
HOW I LANDED A ROLE IN A MARVEL
MOVIE.

131
00:10:36,997 --> 00:10:40,549
AND THE TRUTH IS I GOT SHANG-CHI
HOW HOW EVERY CANADIAN GETS
THEIR BIG BREAK.

132
00:10:40,549 --> 00:10:42,307
BY ASKING POLITELY

133
00:10:42,307 --> 00:10:46,746
FOR REAL
BACK IN 2014, AND THIS IS A TRUE
STORY, I TWEETED,

134
00:10:46,746 --> 00:10:49,620
"HEY, MARVEL
GREAT JOB WITH CAPTAIN AMERICA
AND THOR

135
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:51,440
HOW ABOUT AN ASIAN SUPERHERO?"

136
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:54,306
I THINK THAT TWEET GOT LIKE TEN LIKES,

137
00:10:54,306 --> 00:10:56,752
WHICH IS LIKE, TEN MORE
THAT I USUALLY GOT,

138
00:10:56,752 --> 00:11:01,766
AND I WORKED
HARD, AND FIVE YEARS LATER,
MARVEL DID MAKE THEIR FIRST
ASIAN SUPERHERO MOVIE,

139
00:11:01,766 --> 00:11:06,090
AND AFTER
I GOT THE PART, I WENT ONLINE
AND TWEETED "THANKS FOR GETTING
BACK TO ME."

140
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:08,627
CLEARLY, I'M CANADIAN.

141
00:11:10,912 --> 00:11:14,719
I REALLY CAN'T BELIEVE MY LIFE
RIGHT NOW BECAUSE TEN YEARS AGO

142
00:11:14,719 --> 00:11:18,454
I HAD A JOB DRESSING UP AS
SPIDERMAN AT KIDS BIRTHDAY
PARTIES.

143
00:11:18,454 --> 00:11:23,862
PAY
DRINK

144
00:11:23,862 --> 00:11:26,982
AND I'LL NEVER FORGET THIS ONE
BIRTHDAY BOY
HIS NAME WAS TREVOR,

145
00:11:26,982 --> 00:11:31,923
AND I DON'T
WANT TO SAY ANYTHING BAD ABOUT
HIM, BUT LET'S JUST SAY HE WAS A

COLIN JOST AND MICHAEL CHE

887
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:33,949
>> THANK YOU
GOOD EVENING, EVERYONE.

888
00:40:33,949 --> 00:40:37,743
>> WELCOME TO "WEEKEND UPDATE.
I'M MICHAEL CHE.
>> I'M COLIN JOST.

889
00:40:38,456 --> 00:40:41,811
>>> WELL, YESTERDAY WAS A WEIRD
ONE FOR PRESIDENT BIDEN.

890
00:40:41,811 --> 00:40:44,644
HE WENT UNDER ANESTHESIA FOR A
COLONOSCOPY,

891
00:40:44,644 --> 00:40:48,998
AND WHEN HE WOKE
UP, THE HOUSE HAD PASSED THE
$2 TRILLION SOCIAL SAFETY NET BILL,

892
00:40:48,998 --> 00:40:50,856
THE RITTENHOUSE VERDICT
WAS ANNOUNCED

893
00:40:50,856 --> 00:40:53,920
AND A WOMAN HAD
TECHNICALLY BEEN PRESIDENT FOR
THE FIRST TIME EVER.

894
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:56,065
AND WHILE BIDEN WAS PROCESSING ALL OF THAT,

895
00:40:56,065 --> 00:40:59,580
HE WAS RUSHED OFF
TO PARDON A TURKEY NAMED PEANUT
BUTTER

896
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:02,382
I MEAN, COME ON.
THE GUY JUST TURNED 79

897
00:41:02,382 --> 00:41:04,269
AND
HALF THE COUNTRY ALREADY THINKS
HE'S SENILE.

898
00:41:04,269 --> 00:41:08,325
YOU CAN'T DROP ALL OF THAT ON
HIM THE SECOND HE COMES OUT OF
THE GAS.

899
00:41:08,325 --> 00:41:10,897
I HONESTLY CAN'T BELIEVE HOW
WELL IT WENT

900
00:41:10,897 --> 00:41:13,900
REMEMBER DAVID AFTER THE
DENTIST?

901
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:18,460
I'M KIND OF SURPRISED WE DIDN'T
GET BIDEN AFTER THE COLONOSCOPY.

902
00:41:18,818 --> 00:41:23,549
>>> ON FRIDAY, KYLE RITTENHOUSE
WAS FOUND NOT GUILTY

903
00:41:23,549 --> 00:41:26,949
IN THE
MURDER OF TWO MEN DURING THE
BLACK LIVES MATTER PROTESTS.

904
00:41:26,949 --> 00:41:29,274
SO HOPEFULLY HE GOT ALL OF THAT
SHOOTING OUT OF HIS SYSTEM

905
00:41:29,274 --> 00:41:32,336
BEFORE HE BECOMES A COP.

906
00:41:32,336 --> 00:41:38,011
PROTESTS ARE BEING HELD ALL
AROUND THE COUNTRY IN RESPONSE
TO THE ACQUITTAL OF KYLE RITTENHOUSE

907
00:41:38,011 --> 00:41:41,630
WHICH IS BRAVE
BECAUSE RITTENHOUSE JUST GOT OFF
FOR SHOOTING PROTESTERS.

908
00:41:41,630 --> 00:41:44,900
I DON'T KNOW, MAYBE DON'T TEMPT
HIM.

909
00:41:45,507 --> 00:41:50,679
>>> MATT GAETZ SAID HIS OFFICE
WOULD BE OPEN TO HIRING KYLE
RITTENHOUSE AS A CONGRESSIONAL INTERN

910
00:41:50,679 --> 00:41:55,747
BECAUSE GAETZ HAS ALWAYS
LOVED TEENAGERS WHO ARE WILLING
TO DO TERRIBLE THINGS.

911
00:42:02,121 --> 00:42:07,041
>>> STEVE BANNON, SEEN HERE
ORDERING "ONE NEW LIVER, PLEASE,"

SURRENDERED TO THE FBI
ON CONTEMPT OF CONGRESS CHARGES

913
00:42:10,699 --> 00:42:13,437
AND SAID, "WE'RE TAKING DOWN THE
BIDEN REGIME."

914
00:42:13,437 --> 00:42:18,618
I HATE TO BREAK IT TO YOU,
STEVE, BUT I THINK BIDEN'S GOT
THAT COVERED ALL ON HIS OWN.

915
00:42:20,723 --> 00:42:24,411
BANNON ADDRESSED HIS SUPPORTERS
IN A LIVE STREAM ON GETTR,

916
00:42:24,411 --> 00:42:27,408
A
SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORM POPULAR
WITH TRUMP ALLIES.

917
00:42:27,408 --> 00:42:33,008
GETTR IS NAMED AFTER WHAT ITS
USERS SAY WHENEVER THEY SEE A
WOMAN WALKING ALONE.

NETFLIX SPECIAL CONTROVERSY.

920
00:42:42,990 --> 00:42:45,622

00:43:11,098 --> 00:43:15,478

AFTER POSTING A VIOLENT ANIME VIDEO

THAT DEPICTED HIM KILLING
ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ

929
00:43:18,667 --> 00:43:22,314

PUNISHED, HE'S LIKE, IS IT
NIPPLE CLAMP

931
00:43:26,593 --> 00:43:31,402
I JUST HOPE AN OCTOBER PUS
DOESN'T DO ANYTHING TO ME.
