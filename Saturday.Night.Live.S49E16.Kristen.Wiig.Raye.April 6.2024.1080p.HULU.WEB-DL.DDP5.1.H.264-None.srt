ADMIT
I AM NOT AN EXPERT ON COLLEGE
BASKETBALL.

9
00:00:29,075 --> 00:00:34,183
I AM MUCH MORE COMFORTABLE ON MY
OTHER SHOW, YOU KNOW THE ONE ON CNN WITH GAYLE KING

10
00:00:34,183 --> 00:00:38,134

00:01:26,323 --> 00:01:28,456
I'M ONLY DOING ADS FOR THREE OF
THEM.

MADE IN THE CONNECTICUT-SOUTH
CAROLINA GAME?

28
00:01:33,912 --> 00:01:36,134
>> SHE DOESN'T PLAY FOR EITHER
OF THOSE TEAMS.

29
00:01:36,134 --> 00:01:39,796
I KNOW.
SHE SHOT IT FROM A DIFFERENT
ARENA.

30
00:01:39,796 --> 00:01:42,211
>> CAN I TELL Y'ALL SOMETHING
ELSE ABOUT CAITLIN CLARK?

31
00:01:42,211 --> 00:01:44,818

00:01:47,095 --> 00:01:50,896
WE WERE SHOOTING AROUND, AND IN
BETWEEN TAKES,
BOOM

34
00:01:50,896 --> 00:01:54,472
SHE JUMPED 10 FEET IN THE AIR
AROUSE

35
00:01:54,472 --> 00:01:58,261
AND HUNG ON
TO THE RIM, WRAPPED HER LEGS
AROUND MY HEAD AND SAID,

36
00:01:58,261 --> 00:02:01,450
WELCOME
TO THE CREAM TEAM, YOU
BALANCED-HEADED BITCH.

37
00:02:01,857 --> 00:02:04,993

00:02:10,136 --> 00:02:12,577

BELIEVE BETWEEN

42
00:02:17,746 --> 00:02:21,728
QUIMMINAC
COLLEGE VERSUS NORTHERN SOUTHERN
STATE.

43
00:02:21,728 --> 00:02:25,486
>> NEITHER OF THOSE ARE REAL SCHOOLS.
IT'S ACTUALLY
PURDUE-CONNECTICUT.

44
00:02:25,486 --> 00:02:27,882
CHARLES, CAN YOU BREAK DOWN THE
MATCHUPS FOR US?

45
00:02:27,882 --> 00:02:31,083
GUESS

00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:46,510
I THINK THAT ABOUT COVERS IT.

52
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:49,898
>> YOU KNOW, LET'S TALK TO AN
ACTUAL COLLEGE BASKETBALL
EXPERT.

JOINING US NOW VIA SATELLITE
WITH HER TAKE ON THE TOURNEY

54
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,059

LSU WOMEN'S COACH, KIM MULKEY.

55
00:02:55,059 --> 00:02:57,066
KIM, THANKS FOR BEING HERE.

56
00:02:58,498 --> 00:03:03,165

>> THANK YOU, CHARLES.
I GOT THIS CUSTOM MADE.

59
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:12,166
I JUST TOLD THEM, MAKE ME LOOK
LIKE THE RIDDLER WENT TO
TALBOTS.

60
00:03:12,166 --> 00:03:16,432
>> YOU'RE KNOWN FOR BEING TOUGH
ON YOUR PLAYERS.
SOME SAY TOO TOUGH.

61
00:03:16,432 --> 00:03:22,203
>> PLEASE, PEOPLE JUST THINK I'M
MEAN BECAUSE OF MY FACE.

62
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:26,326
BUT THAT'S WHAT IT TAKES TO WIN
IN THE COLLEGE GAME,

63
00:03:26,326 --> 00:03:29,173
AND I WORK
MY GIRLS HARD EVERY DAY.

64
00:03:29,173 --> 00:03:32,297
I MAKE THEM RUN TEN MILES
BREATHING IN LOUISIANA SWAMP
GAS.

65
00:03:32,297 --> 00:03:34,287
THEN WE PRACTICE FULL CONTACT.

66
00:03:34,287 --> 00:03:37,433
IF I DON'T SEE HUSTLE, I'LL
THROW A LIVE ALLIGATOR ON THE
COURT.

67
00:03:37,433 --> 00:03:40,389
BETTER

68
00:03:40,389 --> 00:03:44,500
>> OKAY THEN.
COACH, WHO DO YOU LIKE FOR THE
MEN ACE FINAL ON MONDAY?

69
00:03:44,575 --> 00:03:49,149
>> OH, NORERN SOUTHERN STATE.

70
00:03:49,149 --> 00:03:52,160
>> SHE'S CLEARLY NOT WATCHING IT
EITHER.
THANKS, COACH.

71
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:54,488
>> MAN, I LIKE HER, MAN.
SHE IS TOUGH,

72
00:03:54,488 --> 00:03:58,643
AND THAT'S WHY HER
TEAMS ALWAYS WIN, EXCEPT THIS
YEAR WHEN THEY LOST.

73
00:03:58,643 --> 00:04:02,214
>> ALL RIGHT, GUYS.
WOMEN'S COLLEGE FINAL IS
TOMORROW.
WHO YOU GOT?

74
00:04:02,214 --> 00:04:05,942

THIS ONE.

75
00:04:05,942 --> 00:04:09,962
LET ME JUST GOOGLE VEGAS WOMEN'S
SPREAD.

76
00:04:09,962 --> 00:04:13,283
THAT'S NOT WHAT I THOUGHT IT WAS
GOING TO BE.

77
00:04:13,283 --> 00:04:16,365
>> WELL, I'M GOING WITH SOUTH
CAROLINA.

78
00:04:16,365 --> 00:04:18,851
I MEAN, THEY HAVEN'T LOST A
SINGLE GAME THIS ENTIRE SEASON.

79
00:04:18,851 --> 00:04:23,022
>> COME ON, KENNY.
YOU KNOW IOWA IS A TEAM OF
DESTINY, MAN.
THEY HOT RIGHT NOW,

80
00:04:23,022 --> 00:04:25,938
AND THEY'VE
GOT THE GREATEST PLAYER OF HER
GENERATION.

81
00:04:25,938 --> 00:04:29,389
THAT'S WHY I BET 500,000 THEY'RE
GOING TO LOSE BY TEN.

82
00:04:29,389 --> 00:04:33,007
>> YOU GOT A PROBLEM, CHARLES.
KEEP IT HERE AND --

83
00:04:33,007 --> 00:04:36,407
>> LIVE FROM NEW YORK, IT'S

85
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:16,671
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

86
00:07:16,671 --> 00:07:19,913
OKAY.
I AM SO HAPPY TO BE BACK,

87
00:07:19,913 --> 00:07:23,800

00:07:29,334 --> 00:07:32,659
OH, YOU KNOW WHAT, REALLY WITH
QUICK.
I REALIZED I HAVEN'T HAD A
CHANCE TO SAY HI TO THE BAND.

91
00:07:32,659 --> 00:07:34,226
MIND IF I DO THAT REALLY QUICK?

92
00:07:34,226 --> 00:07:37,105

CAST MEMBER, IT IS VERY SPECIAL
BEING A FIVE TIMER.

97
00:07:54,173 --> 00:07:55,018

98
00:07:55,018 --> 00:07:57,504

THIS IS EXCITING.
IT'S SO EXCITING.

102
00:08:10,556 --> 00:08:13,319
AREN'T YOU EXCITED?
TONIGHT YOU'RE GETTING YOUR FIVE
TIMERS JACKET.

103
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:15,127

104
00:08:15,127 --> 00:08:17,573
>> YEAH.

105
00:08:17,573 --> 00:08:21,136
>> YOU KNOW, I ALSO HEARD A
RUMOR YOU MIGHT BE DOING ONE OF
THOSE FIVE TIMER SKETCHES

106
00:08:21,136 --> 00:08:23,521
FEATURING AWESOME CELEBRITY
CAMEOS.

107
00:08:23,521 --> 00:08:27,819
IS THERE LIKE A SCRIPT OR
SOMETHING I COULD LOOK AT FOR
THAT?

108
00:08:27,819 --> 00:08:31,992
>> OH, SORRY.
I DON'T THINK WE'RE DOING ONE OF
THOSE.

109
00:08:31,992 --> 00:08:36,510
>> OH.
OKAY.

110
00:08:37,782 --> 00:08:42,750
>> BUT I'M REALLY EXCITED ABOUT
GETTING MY JACKET TONIGHT.

111
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:45,806
OH, ANOTHER QUESTION.
YES, PAULA.

112
00:08:52,401 --> 00:08:54,839
>> HI.
I USED TO BE A WRITER HERE,

113
00:08:54,839 --> 00:08:56,840
BUT
TONIGHT I'M PLAYING AN AUDIENCE MEMBER,

114
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:59,488
SO SHE'S GOING TO
PRETEND LIKE SHE DOESN'T KNOW
ME.

115
00:08:59,488 --> 00:09:01,812
>> WHAT'S YOUR QUESTION, MA'AM?

116
00:09:01,812 --> 00:09:07,437
>> I THINK IT'S SO SWEET THAT
YOU'RE SO EXCITED ABOUT GETTING
A FIVE TIMERS JACKET.

117
00:09:07,437 --> 00:09:12,302
YOU KNOW, THEY BASICALLY HAND
THOSE OUT TO EVERYBODY LIKE FREE
MAX iPADS.

118
00:09:13,613 --> 00:09:18,619
>> THANK YOU.
BUT THEY DON'T JUST HAND THE
JACKETS OUT TO ANYONE.

119
00:09:18,619 --> 00:09:20,635
YOU GOT TO HOST FIVE TIMES.

120
00:09:20,635 --> 00:09:21,980
OH, ANOTHER QUESTION.

121
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:24,676
YES, MATT DAMON.
HI.

122
00:09:32,297 --> 00:09:35,250
HI, KRISTEN.
WELL, FIRST OFF, BIG FAN.

123
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:39,043
I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW I GREW
UP WATCHING YOU ON SNL.

124
00:09:39,043 --> 00:09:42,693
>> GREW UP WATCHING ME ON SNL?

125
00:09:42,693 --> 00:09:48,663
WAIT, MATT, WHY DO YOU HAVE ON A
FIVE TIMERS JACKET?
HAVEN'T YOU ONLY HOSTED TWICE?

126
00:09:48,663 --> 00:09:53,678
>> YEAH.
BUT LORNE SAID THE FIRST TIME I
HOSTED WAS SO GOOD, IT COUNTED
FOR THREE.

127
00:09:53,678 --> 00:09:57,708
AND THEN, SECOND TIME, NOT QUITE
AS GOOD, THAT ONLY COUNTED FOR
TWO.

128
00:09:57,708 --> 00:10:00,919
BUT BY MY MATH, THAT'S FIVE,
BABY.

129
00:10:00,919 --> 00:10:04,326
>> OKAY.
WELL, THAT DOESN'T REALLY SEEM
FAIR.

130
00:10:04,326 --> 00:10:07,024
I MEAN, I'VE HOSTED FIVE TIMES.
I EARNED THIS, RIGHT?

131
00:10:07,024 --> 00:10:08,816
DOESN'T THIS JACKET HAVE ANY
MEANING ANYMORE?

132
00:10:08,816 --> 00:10:10,516
I DON'T KNOW.
LORNE?

133
00:10:10,516 --> 00:10:15,309
>> THIS JACKET IS SO --
>> I LOVE THIS.

134
00:10:20,916 --> 00:10:24,370
>> WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
GUYS ARE YOU HERE GETTING
JACKETS TOO?

135
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:26,421
NONE OF YOU HAVE EVEN HOSTED
FIVE TIMES.

136
00:10:26,421 --> 00:10:29,403
>> YEAH.
BUT TOGETHER WE'VE HOSTED FIVE
TIMES.

137
00:10:29,403 --> 00:10:31,837
LIKE I'VE HOSTED ONE TIME.

138
00:10:31,837 --> 00:10:35,535
>> AND I'VE HOSTED ONE TIME.
MY JACKET'S A LITTLE SMALL,
ISN'T IT?

139
00:10:35,535 --> 00:10:37,510
>> I'VE HOSTED THREE TIMES.

140
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:41,102
THE LAST TIME WAS IN 2010, BUT
I'M SURE THE FOURTH ONE IS
COMING UP, RIGHT LORNE?

141
00:10:41,102 --> 00:10:44,347
>> HOW DARE YOU PUT LORNE ON THE
SPOT LIKE THAT?

142
00:10:44,347 --> 00:10:48,286
I HAVEN'T HOSTED SINCE 2012.

143
00:10:48,286 --> 00:10:51,346
>> OH, SWEET.
SO WE ARE DOING A FIVE TIMERS
SKETCH.

144
00:10:51,346 --> 00:10:54,645
>> GUYS, WHAT IS GOING ON HERE?

145
00:10:54,645 --> 00:10:57,263
I WAS REALLY EXCITED ABOUT BEING
IN THE FIVE TIMERS CLUB,

146
00:10:57,263 --> 00:10:59,890
BUT NOW
IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S NOT EVEN THAT
SPECIAL.

147
00:10:59,890 --> 00:11:02,219
>> YOU KNOW WHAT, YOU'RE RIGHT.
I FEEL BAD.

148
00:11:02,219 --> 00:11:05,805
I SHOULD PROBABLY GIVE YOU MY
JACKET.

149
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:11,229
>> THAT'S FINE.
YOU WERE GREAT.
YOU DESERVE IT.

150
00:11:11,229 --> 00:11:12,911
>> I DO.
I DO.

151
00:11:12,911 --> 00:11:15,147
I MEAN, I CAME BACK FOR A BUNCH
OF CAMEOS.

152
00:11:15,147 --> 00:11:18,449
I DID THAT CAVANAUGH THING.
REMEMBER THE CAVANAUGH?

153
00:11:18,449 --> 00:11:22,562
OH, REALLY?
I GET A JACKET FOR THAT?

154
00:11:22,562 --> 00:11:25,788
>> THEY JUST GAVE YOU ANOTHER
JACKET.
>> JUST FOR A CAMEO, RIGHT?

155
00:11:25,788 --> 00:11:30,612
THAT'S LIKE EXCESSIVE.
I DON'T WANT IT.
I'LL GIVE IT TO LIKE ONE OF MY
KIDS.

156
00:11:30,612 --> 00:11:34,137
KRISTEN, YOU SHOULD REALLY FEEL
PROUD OF YOURSELF.

157
00:11:34,137 --> 00:11:38,985
DID YOU KNOW YOU'RE THE YOUNGEST
MEMBER OF THE FIVE TIMERS CLUB?

158
00:11:38,985 --> 00:11:41,993
>> NO, ACTUALLY, THAT'S NOT
TRUE.

159
00:11:41,993 --> 00:11:44,482
EMMA STONE WAS HERE JUST A FEW
WEEKS AGO.

160
00:11:44,482 --> 00:11:49,417

FIRST FEMALE MEMBER OF THE FIVE
TIMERS CLUB.

161
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:51,508
>> NO.
I JUST SAID EMMA STONE WAS HERE.

162
00:11:51,508 --> 00:11:53,587
BY THE WAY, THERE'S LOTS OF
OTHER WOMEN.

163
00:11:53,587 --> 00:11:57,269
>> FIRST FRENCH WOMAN.

164
00:11:57,269 --> 00:11:58,961
>> I'M NOT A FRENCH WOMAN.

165
00:11:58,961 --> 00:12:02,087

FRENCH.

>> YOU MEAN THE FICTIONAL MOVIE
ABOUT A MAGICAL GAME?

SAME

>> THE ROCK AND KEVIN HART.

224
00:16:02,216 --> 00:16:07,023

TALKING ABOUT THE NEW JUMANJI.

225
00:16:07,023 --> 00:16:11,277

JUMANJI.

JUMANJI ME.

228
00:16:17,208 --> 00:16:20,673
>> OKAY.
WHAT EVEN IS JUMANJI TO YOU,
LADY?

229
00:16:20,673 --> 00:16:23,789
BECAUSE IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU THINK
JUMANJI IS GOING INTO JUMANJI,

230
00:16:23,789 --> 00:16:25,990
BUT IN JUMANJI, JUMANJI COMES
OUT.

231
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:30,189
THE KIDS DON'T GO INTO JUMANJI,
JUMANJI COMES OUT OF JUMANJI.

232
00:16:30,189 --> 00:16:33,779
>> ROBIN WILLIAMS GOES INTO
JUMANJI.

233
00:16:33,779 --> 00:16:37,517
>> ONE GUY.
INTO

234
00:16:37,517 --> 00:16:39,828
THE REST OF JUMANJI IS JUMANJI
COMES OUT.

235
00:16:39,828 --> 00:16:41,215
>> YOU'RE YELLING.

236
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:43,536
>> I'M JUST SAYING, SHE DOESN'T
KNOW WHAT SHE'S TALKING ABOUT.

237
00:16:43,536 --> 00:16:47,446
WHICH IS IT?
ARE YOU AFRAID OF BEING
JUMANJIED INTO JUMANJI

238
00:16:47,446 --> 00:16:50,384
OR
JUMANJI THAT COMES OUT?

239
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:54,641
>> JUMANJI IS A SERIES OF JUNGLE
EMERGENCIES.

240
00:16:54,642 --> 00:16:57,041
JUNGLE
EMERGENCIES.

241
00:16:57,041 --> 00:17:00,833
THAT SIR, IS JUMANJI, AND WE ARE
NOT PREPARED FOR THAT.

242
00:17:00,833 --> 00:17:03,166
WE HAVE NO MEDICINES.
WE HAVE NO ROPE.

243
00:17:03,166 --> 00:17:07,507
>> THAT'S NOT EVEN WHAT WOULD
HAPPEN IF WE GOT JUMANJIED INTO
THIS TRAIN BECAUSE THIS GAME IS
TRAINS.

244
00:17:07,507 --> 00:17:09,834
NO JUNGLE

245
00:17:09,834 --> 00:17:12,464
EXACTLY.
IF I GOT JUMANJIED INTO
MONOPOLY,

246
00:17:12,464 --> 00:17:14,475
IT'S BE THE MUSTACHE MAN,

247
00:17:14,475 --> 00:17:18,493
NOT JUNGLE EMERGENCY.

248
00:17:20,531 --> 00:17:23,830
>> OH, SO NOW EVERYONE'S AN
EXPERT ON JUMANJI?

249
00:17:23,830 --> 00:17:27,407
BECAUSE FIVE F'ing SECONDS AGO,
YOU ALL ACTED LIKE I WAS A NUT.

250
00:17:27,407 --> 00:17:29,421
>> I AMENT THE MAN OF THIS HOUSE,

251
00:17:29,421 --> 00:17:32,999
AND I WANT TO PLAY THE
GAME I GOT FROM THE OLD LADY AT
THE ESTATE SALE.

252
00:17:32,999 --> 00:17:35,457
WE ARE PLAYING THIS DAMN GAME.

253
00:17:35,753 --> 00:17:39,779
OKAY.
JUST BECAUSE FOG IS COMING OUT OF THE BOX

254
00:17:39,779 --> 00:17:42,313
DOES NOT MEAN WE'RE
GETTING JUMANJIED.

255
00:17:43,053 --> 00:17:45,267
WE'RE NOT GETTING JUMANJIED.

256
00:17:45,268 --> 00:17:48,701
>> WE GETTING JUMANJIED.

257
00:17:48,701 --> 00:17:51,984
>> I KNEW IT!
>> BABE, WHAT'S HAPPENING?

258
00:18:02,444 --> 00:18:05,137
>> ALL RIGHT.
THAT'S MY BAD, Y'ALL.

259
00:18:05,137 --> 00:18:07,191
>> WELL, WELL, WELL.

260
00:18:07,191 --> 00:18:10,192
WELCOME TO TICKET TO RIDE.

261
00:18:10,192 --> 00:18:12,558
WE GOT A RAILROAD TO BUILD.

262
00:18:12,558 --> 00:18:15,007
AND IF ANY OF YOU TRY TO LEAVE,

263
00:18:15,007 --> 00:18:17,859
YOU'LL BE TIED TO THE TRACKS AND
LEFT FOR THE COYOTES.

264
00:18:17,859 --> 00:18:20,885
EXCEPT FOR YOU BECAUSE YOU
SPECIFICALLY SAID

265
00:18:20,885 --> 00:18:23,319
YOU DID NOT
WANT TO BE JUMANJIED INTO TRAIN
GAME.

266
00:18:23,319 --> 00:18:24,484
YOU ARE FREE TO GO.

267
00:18:24,484 --> 00:18:27,445
>> YES!
I KNEW IT.
I'M FREE.

268
00:18:27,445 --> 00:18:30,001
AND HARRY, I DON'T THINK THIS IS
GOING TO WORK OUT

269
00:18:30,001 --> 00:18:33,390
BECAUSE IT
SEEMS LIKE YOU AND ALL YOUR
FRIENDS ARE GOING TO DIE.

270
00:18:35,613 --> 00:18:38,835
>> AWW, YOU LOST YOUR GIRL.
THAT'S TOO BAD.

271
00:18:38,835 --> 00:18:43,174
BUT, HEY, JUST REMEMBER, IF YOU
LOSE THE GAME, YOU DIE IN REAL
LIFE.

272
00:18:43,174 --> 00:18:46,602
HOPE THAT HELPS.
ALL ABOARD!

273
00:18:55,469 --> 00:18:59,092
SHOULDN'T

274
00:18:59,092 --> 00:19:02,933
>> OH, COME ON, JESS.
I THINK IT'LL BE FUN.
LET'S GO.

275
00:19:04,630 --> 00:19:06,926
>> HELLO?

276
00:19:06,926 --> 00:19:09,279
>> WHAT IS THIS PLACE?

277
00:19:09,279 --> 00:19:11,552
WHY IS IT SO DARK?

278
00:19:11,552 --> 00:19:15,111
>> AND WHAT ARE THESE MACHINES?

279
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:20,942
>> HEY, MAMAS, IS THIS YOUR
FIRST CLASS?

280
00:19:20,942 --> 00:19:24,228
>> PILATES, FROM THE CREATOR OF SAW X

281
00:19:24,228 --> 00:19:26,092
AND THE MARKETING DIRECTOR FOR ALO

282
00:19:26,092 --> 00:19:28,424
COMES A CHILLING NEW
LOOK AT GIRL HORROR.

283
00:19:28,424 --> 00:19:29,993
>> IT'S NOT WHAT YOU THINK IT'LL
BE.

284
00:19:29,993 --> 00:19:34,507
IT'S SO HARD, BUT IT'S ALSO SO
BORING.

285
00:19:34,507 --> 00:19:36,738
>> GOOD JOB, MAMAS.

286
00:19:36,738 --> 00:19:40,880
NOW TAKE THOSE FOOT STRAPS TO
YOUR HAND STRAPS, WRAP YOUR HAND
STRAPS AROUND YOUR FOOT STRAPS,

287
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:45,378
TAKE THOSE ANKLE STRAPS AROUND
YOUR WAIST AND THE KNEE STRAPS
AROUND YOUR HEAD.

288
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:49,613
>> THE MACHINE IS CALLED A
REFORMER.

289
00:19:49,613 --> 00:19:51,661

457
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:25,516
IMPORTANTLY, YOU SHARED YOUR

458
00:26:25,518 --> 00:26:27,885
CORN NUTS, AND I WILL NEVER

459
00:26:27,887 --> 00:26:29,353

THANK YOU COLLEEN.

467
00:26:41,434 --> 00:26:41,832
SORRY.

468
00:26:41,834 --> 00:26:42,933

>> THANK YOU.

472
00:26:47,139 --> 00:26:48,772
I NEED TO TELL A LITTLE STORY

473
00:26:48,774 --> 00:26:51,775
ABOUT THIS SAINT JERRY.

474
00:26:51,777 --> 00:26:54,011
HE HELPED ME OUT ON ONE OF THE

475
00:26:54,013 --> 00:26:55,746
HARDEST DAYS OF MY LIFE.

476
00:26:55,748 --> 00:26:58,148
I SAY ONE OF BECAUSE I WITNESSED

477
00:26:58,150 --> 00:27:00,851
A TRIPLE MURDER AS A TODDLER.

478
00:27:00,853 --> 00:27:03,120
ANY WHO, ONE DAY I BROUGHT MY

479
00:27:03,122 --> 00:27:04,822
PRECIOUS PEBBLES TO WORK.

480
00:27:04,824 --> 00:27:07,424
PEBBLES WAS MY SERVICE

481
00:27:07,426 --> 00:27:07,825
CHINCHILLA.

482
00:27:07,827 --> 00:27:10,561
SOMEHOW PEBBLES GOT STUCK IN THE

483
00:27:10,563 --> 00:27:11,929
INDUSTRIAL FAN AND WAS

484
00:27:11,931 --> 00:27:16,767
TRAGICALLY KILLED TO DEATH.

485
00:27:16,769 --> 00:27:17,935
HEAD RIPPED OFF HER BODY AND

486
00:27:17,937 --> 00:27:19,036
THROWN ACROSS THE ROOM.

487
00:27:19,038 --> 00:27:21,972
THE REST OF HER LOOKED LIKE IT

488
00:27:21,974 --> 00:27:25,843
HAD BEEN SPRAYED INTO A

489
00:27:25,845 --> 00:27:26,243
WOODCHIPER.

490
00:27:26,245 --> 00:27:30,914
JERRY HELPED ME SPOOL INTESTINES

491

COLLECTED THE REST OF WHAT CAN

493
00:27:34,854 --> 00:27:36,553
ONLY BE DESCRIBED AS CHUM.

494

WRONG WITH SEX NOW?

OPINION.

537
00:28:54,467 --> 00:28:55,799
I THINK THE WISDOM OF THE BODY

538
00:28:55,801 --> 00:28:56,633
IS SACRED.

539
00:28:56,635 --> 00:28:58,035

LET'S END THAT THERE.

546
00:29:12,618 --> 00:29:14,318
I'M NOT SURE WHY PEOPLE THINK

547
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,019
IT'S OKAY TO JUST GRAB THE.

548

COMPANY.

558
00:29:40,112 --> 00:29:41,378

576
00:30:11,177 --> 00:30:14,545
SO HARD YOU CAN'T BREATHE.

577
00:30:14,547 --> 00:30:15,879
HE KISSED ME ONCE ON THE MOUTH.

578
00:30:15,881 --> 00:30:16,580
>> THANK YOU.

579
00:30:16,582 --> 00:30:17,014

DOING RESEARCH FOR A MOVIE.

597
00:30:50,115 --> 00:30:52,983
THE CHARACTER WAS A SEX ADDICT,

598
00:30:52,985 --> 00:30:56,453
A PEEPING TOM CHARACTER WITH A

599
00:30:56,455 --> 00:30:59,456
MAJOR ARMPIT FETISH.

600

YOU ARE SO BRAVE.

606
00:31:06,498 --> 00:31:09,032
AND THE FACT THAT YOU EVEN SHOW

607
00:31:09,034 --> 00:31:10,901
YOUR FACE IN PUBLIC SHOWS ME A

608
00:31:10,903 --> 00:31:11,969
STRENGTH I JUST DIDN'T KNOW

609
00:31:11,971 --> 00:31:12,569
PEOPLE HAD.

610
00:31:12,571 --> 00:31:14,304
WHILE THE MOVIE NEVER HAPPENED

611
00:31:14,306 --> 00:31:17,941

795
00:38:23,896 --> 00:38:29,139
MICHAEL CHE.

796
00:38:35,514 --> 00:38:37,493
>>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
GOOD EVENING, EVERYONE.

797
00:38:37,493 --> 00:38:41,297
>> WELCOME TO "WEEKEND UPDATE."
I'M MICHAEL CHE.
>> I'M COLIN JOST.

798
00:38:42,953 --> 00:38:47,796
WELL, YESTERDAY EVERYONE IN NEW
YORK PRETENDED THEY FELT AN
EARTHQUAKE.

799
00:38:47,796 --> 00:38:51,084
JUST ADMIT IT, YOU THOUGHT IT
WAS WIND.

800
00:38:51,084 --> 00:38:54,266
THIS EARTHQUAKE WAS ACTUALLY THE
BEST POSSIBLE DISASTER.

801
00:38:54,266 --> 00:38:56,750
IT WAS KIND OF LIKE THE TIME I
SAW MY DAD IN THE SHOWER.

802
00:38:56,750 --> 00:39:00,245
IT WAS A LITTLE SCARY, THERE WAS
NO PERMANENT DAMAGE,

803
00:39:00,245 --> 00:39:03,021
BUT I'M
GOING TO REMEMBER IT FOR THE
REST OF MY LIFE.

804
00:39:03,021 --> 00:39:06,908
AT A CAMPAIGN RALLY, FORMER
PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID

805
00:39:06,908 --> 00:39:10,062
HE WOULD
DEBATE PRESIDENT BIDEN ANY TIME,
ANY PLACE.

806
00:39:10,062 --> 00:39:12,872
AND THEN HE POINTED TO AN EMPTY
PODIUM ON THE STAGE.

807
00:39:12,872 --> 00:39:18,272
NOW TRUMP AND BIDEN ARE BOTH
POLLING 80 POINTS BEHIND THE
PODIUM.

808
00:39:19,459 --> 00:39:22,709
IN A NEW INTERVIEW, DONALD TRUMP
ALSO CLAIMED THAT PRESIDENT BIDEN

809
00:39:22,709 --> 00:39:26,586
WAS HIGH ON COCAINE DURING
THE STATE OF THE UNION,

810
00:39:26,586 --> 00:39:29,460
SAYING
HE WAS ALL JACKED UP AT THE
BEGINNING.

811
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:31,556
BY THE END, HE WAS FADING FAST.

812
00:39:31,556 --> 00:39:35,181
HUH.
IT ALMOST SOUNDS LIKE DONALD
TRUMP KNOWS EXACTLY

813
00:39:35,181 --> 00:39:38,187
WHAT IT
FEELS LIKE TO BE ON COCAINE.

814
00:39:38,187 --> 00:39:42,208
YOU KNOW, LIKE AT THE BEGINNING,
YOU'VE GOT A LOT OF ENERGY.

815
00:39:46,317 --> 00:39:50,076
BUT THEN, BY THE END, YOU'RE
FADING FAST.

816
00:39:50,076 --> 00:39:55,424
>> JUST RECENTLY HEARD THAT
SAUDI ARABIA AND RUSSIA WILL --

817
00:40:00,206 --> 00:40:02,284
>> DONALD TRUMP SAID AT A RALLY

818
00:40:02,284 --> 00:40:06,008
THAT HE WOULD MAKE NOVEMBER 5th
CHRISTIAN VISIBILITY DAY.

819
00:40:06,008 --> 00:40:09,260
WAIT.
I THOUGHT THAT WAS CALLED ASH
WEDNESDAY.

820
00:40:11,141 --> 00:40:14,149
THE FLORIDA SUPREME COURT HAS ALLOWED

821
00:40:14,149 --> 00:40:16,818
THE STATE SIX WEEK
ABORTION BAN TO TAKE EFFECT.

822
00:40:16,818 --> 00:40:20,094
SO NOW FLORIDA'S ONLY REMAINING
METHOD FOR ENDING A PREGNANCY

823
00:40:20,094 --> 00:40:22,434
IS
ROLLER COASTERS.

824
00:40:25,285 --> 00:40:28,596
>> JUST TODAY, DONALD TRUMP
POSTED ON TRUTH SOCIAL

825
00:40:28,596 --> 00:40:32,267
THAT HE
WASN'T SCARED OF GOING TO JAIL
FOR VIOLATING A GAG ORDER, SAYING,

826
00:40:32,267 --> 00:40:36,562
I WILL GLADLY BECOME A
MODERN-DAY NELSON MANDELA.

827
00:40:36,562 --> 00:40:39,790
UNFORTUNATELY, FOR HALLOWEEN.

828
00:40:41,461 --> 00:40:44,511
>> IOWA'S FINAL FOUR GAME AGAINST UCONN

829
00:40:44,511 --> 00:40:47,972
WAS THE MOST
WATCHED WOMEN'S COLLEGE
BASKETBALL GAME EVER

830
00:40:47,972 --> 00:40:50,882
WITH
14.2 MILLION VIEWERS,

831
00:40:50,882 --> 00:40:56,039
BEATING
THE PREVIOUS RECORD BY
14.2 MILLION VIEWERS.

832
00:40:57,442 --> 00:41:03,125
>> IT WAS ALSO REPORTED FRIDAY
THAT THE U.S. ECONOMY ADDED OVER
300,000 JOBS.

833
00:41:03,125 --> 00:41:07,095
UNFORTUNATELY, MOST OF THEM ARE
BRIDGE FIXER.

834
00:41:09,649 --> 00:41:14,407
>> EXPERTS ARE SAYING THAT TWO
DIFFERENT BREEDS OF CICADAS WILL
HATCH THIS MONTH

835
00:41:14,407 --> 00:41:17,260
RELEASING
TRILLIONS CICADAS INTO THE
U.S.

836
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:20,383
AND BIDEN IS JUST LETTING THEM
IN.

837
00:41:23,709 --> 00:41:26,131
>> HOUSE REPUBLICANS HAVE
INTRODUCED A BILL

838
00:41:26,131 --> 00:41:30,159
TO RENAME
WASHINGTON D.C.'S DULLES AIRPORT AFTER DONALD TRUMP,

839
00:41:30,159 --> 00:41:32,307
BECAUSE AIRPORTS ARE A LOT LIKE TRUMP,

840
00:41:32,307 --> 00:41:36,616
A
CHAOTIC NIGHTMARE THAT TURNS YOU
AGAINST YOUR OWN FAMILY.

841
00:41:41,156 --> 00:41:52,258
NEW YORK CITY WAS RATTLED

842
00:41:44,260 --> 00:41:49,463
YESTERDAY MORNING AS A RARE 4.2

843
00:41:49,465 --> 00:41:50,197
MAGNITUDE EARTHQUAKE SHOOK THE

844
00:41:50,199 --> 00:41:52,700
CITY AND MUCH OF THE NORTHEAST

845
00:41:52,702 --> 00:41:53,601
AROUND 10:00 A.M.

846
00:41:53,603 --> 00:41:55,169
HERE WITH MORE IS THE

847
00:41:55,171 --> 00:41:55,570
EARTHQUAKE.

848
00:41:55,572 --> 00:41:56,003
>> OH, YEAH!

849
00:41:56,005 --> 00:41:59,340
WHAT'S UP, NEW YORK?

850
00:41:59,342 --> 00:41:59,974
DIDN'T EXPECT TO FEEL ME

851
00:41:59,976 --> 00:42:03,377
YESTERDAY, DID YOU?

852
00:42:03,379 --> 00:42:06,080
THE CITY WAS THROWN INTO PURE

853
00:42:06,082 --> 00:42:06,647
CHAOS!

854
00:42:06,649 --> 00:42:07,748
>> YEAH.

855
00:42:07,750 --> 00:42:08,950
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT CHAOS.

856
00:42:08,952 --> 00:42:10,818
I MEAN, PEOPLE WERE A LITTLE

857
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:11,218
SURPRISED.

858
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:13,154
>> IT WAS CHAOS, COLIN.

859
00:42:13,156 --> 00:42:16,123
PEOPLE STOPPED WORKING FOR FIVE,

860
00:42:16,125 --> 00:42:17,158
EVEN SIX MINUTES TO TEXT THEIR

861
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:17,825
FRIENDS, DID YOU JUST FEEL

862
00:42:17,827 --> 00:42:22,063
SOMETHING.

863
00:42:22,065 --> 00:42:24,532
COLIN, THE FLIGHTS WERE DELAYED

864
00:42:24,534 --> 00:42:26,901
AT ALL THE AIRPORTS FOR UP TO 30

865
00:42:26,903 --> 00:42:27,234
MINUTES.

866
00:42:27,236 --> 00:42:29,370
UP TO 30 MINUTES, COLIN!

867
00:42:29,372 --> 00:42:33,507
>> HOW LONG ARE THEY NORMALLY

868
00:42:34,544 --> 00:42:34,875
DELAYED?

869
00:42:34,877 --> 00:42:35,276
>> AN HOUR.

870
00:42:35,278 --> 00:42:36,944
MOVE OVER GUY WHO WAS PUNCHING

871
00:42:36,946 --> 00:42:37,812
AWITH IMIN THE FACE.

872
00:42:37,814 --> 00:42:40,414
I PUNCHED THE WHOLE CITY IN THE

873
00:42:40,416 --> 00:42:40,715
FACE.

874
00:42:40,717 --> 00:42:42,950
A BUNCH OF TEENY TINY PUNCHES

875
00:42:42,952 --> 00:42:45,186
LIKE A SCARY MASSAGE.

876
00:42:45,188 --> 00:42:45,920
BEHOLD THE POWER OF THE NEW YORK

877
00:42:45,922 --> 00:42:50,291
EARTHQUAKE!

878
00:42:50,293 --> 00:42:53,060
>> DIDN'T YOU ORIGINATE IN NEW

879
00:42:53,062 --> 00:42:53,527
JERSEY, THOUGH?

880
00:42:53,529 --> 00:42:56,097
>> I GREW UP THERE, BUT I MOVED

881
00:42:56,099 --> 00:42:57,665
TO THE CITY.

882
00:42:57,667 --> 00:42:59,600
I'M THE NEW YORK EARTHQUAKE!

883
00:42:59,602 --> 00:43:02,169
AND THERE IS NOTHING ON EARTH AS

884
00:43:02,171 --> 00:43:05,339
POWERFUL AS ME.

885
00:43:05,341 --> 00:43:07,975
>> WHAT IS THIS CANDY-ASS LITTLE

886
00:43:07,977 --> 00:43:10,444
FOOL TALKING ABOUT?

887
00:43:10,446 --> 00:43:12,179
>> OH, MY GOD.

888
00:43:12,181 --> 00:43:12,680
IT'S THE ECLIPSE.

889
00:43:12,682 --> 00:43:17,885
>> YEAH.

890
00:43:17,887 --> 00:43:19,353
YOU LISTEN UP GOOD EARTHQUAKE.

891
00:43:19,355 --> 00:43:21,856
YOU WANT TO DO A LITTLE SHIMMY

892
00:43:21,858 --> 00:43:24,258
SHAKE AND TRY TO STEAL MY

893
00:43:24,260 --> 00:43:24,592
THUNDER?

894
00:43:24,594 --> 00:43:27,194
WHAT YOU GOING TO DO WHEN THE

895
00:43:27,196 --> 00:43:29,196
SOLAR ECLIPSE RUNS WILD ON YOU?

896
00:43:29,198 --> 00:43:31,966
COME MONDAY, ALL OF AMERICA WILL

897
00:43:31,968 --> 00:43:33,734
BE COVERED IN ETERNAL DARKNESS.

898
00:43:33,736 --> 00:43:34,235
>> I DON'T KNOW.

899
00:43:34,237 --> 00:43:36,003
I HEARD THE ECLIPSE IS ONLY

900
00:43:36,005 --> 00:43:37,905
SUPPOSED TO LAST LIKE FOUR

901
00:43:37,907 --> 00:43:38,272
MINUTES.

902
00:43:38,274 --> 00:43:41,842
>> WHICH IS GOING TO FEEL LIKE

903
00:43:41,844 --> 00:43:42,743
AN ETERNITY WHEN YOU'RE STARING

904
00:43:42,745 --> 00:43:43,911
AT ME THROUGH A SHOE BOX.

905
00:43:43,913 --> 00:43:46,847
>> WELL, YOU LISTEN TO ME, YOU

906
00:43:46,849 --> 00:43:48,883
PATHETIC EXCUSE TO MAKE THE MOON

907
00:43:48,885 --> 00:43:50,384
EXCITING, IF YOU THOUGHT I WAS

908
00:43:50,386 --> 00:43:51,986
DONE AFTER ONE EARTHQUAKE, JUST

909
00:43:51,988 --> 00:43:54,088
WAIT UNTIL YOU FEEL THE

910
00:43:54,090 --> 00:43:54,789
AFTERSHOCKS!

911
00:43:54,791 --> 00:43:56,223
OH, YEAH, BROTHER!

912
00:43:56,225 --> 00:43:59,360
I HIT IT, I QUIT IT, AND I REDID

913
00:43:59,362 --> 00:43:59,727
IT.

914
00:43:59,729 --> 00:44:01,662
OH, WHAT WAS THAT I JUST HEARD?

915
00:44:01,664 --> 00:44:03,297
IT'S ANOTHER BOOK FALLING GENTLY

916
00:44:03,299 --> 00:44:05,232
OFF A SHELF, BABY.

917
00:44:05,234 --> 00:44:07,368
EARTHQUAKE STRIKES AGAIN.

918
00:44:07,370 --> 00:44:09,970
>> FOOL, YOU GOT NOTHING ON THE

919
00:44:09,972 --> 00:44:13,140
CHAOS THAT I WILL BRING.

920
00:44:13,142 --> 00:44:15,109
AND PEOPLE THINK THAT THEY ARE

921
00:44:15,111 --> 00:44:16,911
READY WITH THEIR LITTLE SPECIAL

922
00:44:16,913 --> 00:44:17,278
GLASSES?

923
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:18,846
WELL, MOST OF THEM ARE FAKES

924
00:44:18,848 --> 00:44:19,980
THAT THEY BOUGHT ON AMAZON.

925
00:44:19,982 --> 00:44:23,417
THEIR EYES ARE MINE!

926
00:44:23,419 --> 00:44:25,553
AND THEIR DOGS ARE GOING TO BE

927
00:44:25,555 --> 00:44:27,455
EXTREMELY CONFUSED FOR A COUPLE

928
00:44:27,457 --> 00:44:28,089
OF HOURS.

929
00:44:28,091 --> 00:44:30,991
>> WELL, I MADE THE DOGS

930
00:44:30,993 --> 00:44:31,826
CONFUSED TOO.

931
00:44:31,828 --> 00:44:34,061
>> BUT I'LL MAKE THEM THINK IT'S

932
00:44:34,063 --> 00:44:35,229
NIGHT, SUCKA!

933
00:44:35,231 --> 00:44:38,866
>> GUYS, LET'S CALM DOWN.

934
00:44:38,868 --> 00:44:40,768
YOU'RE BOTH VERY DISRUPTIVE

935
00:44:40,770 --> 00:44:41,302
NATURAL EVENTS.

936
00:44:41,304 --> 00:44:45,039
>> YOU KNOW WHAT, COLIN'S RIGHT,

937
00:44:45,041 --> 00:44:45,573
ECLIPSE.

938
00:44:45,575 --> 00:44:47,575
WE SHOULDN'T BE FIGHTING.

939
00:44:47,577 --> 00:44:48,275
WE SHOULD TEAM UP.

940
00:44:48,277 --> 00:44:52,880
>> AN EARTHQUAKE DURING AN

941
00:44:52,882 --> 00:44:53,314
ECLIPSE?

942
00:44:53,316 --> 00:44:56,283
THAT WOULD BE BIBLICAL, BROTHER.

943
00:44:56,285 --> 00:44:58,786
THE KIND OF THING THAT USED TO

944
00:44:58,788 --> 00:45:01,155
MAKE ANCIENT PEOPLE THROW A

945
00:45:01,157 --> 00:45:02,656
VIRGIN INTO A VOLCANO.

946
00:45:02,658 --> 00:45:03,924
I LIKE IT.

947
00:45:03,926 --> 00:45:06,293
>> NEW YORK DOESN'T NEED ANOTHER

948
00:45:06,295 --> 00:45:09,597
EARTHQUAKE, ESPECIALLY DURING A

949
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:09,964
BLACKOUT.

950
00:45:09,966 --> 00:45:11,031
>> DON'T WORRY.

951
00:45:11,033 --> 00:45:13,000
I'M SURE MAYOR ADAMS WILL HAVE

952
00:45:13,002 --> 00:45:14,268
IT UNDER CONTROL.

953
00:45:14,270 --> 00:45:15,703
>> THE ECLIPSE AND EARTHQUAKE,

954
00:45:15,705 --> 00:45:15,974
EVERYONE.

955
00:45:21,273 --> 00:45:25,099
>> IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE MAN
WHO MARRIED A CON JOINED TWIN

956
00:45:25,099 --> 00:45:27,990
IS
FACING A PATERNITY LAWSUIT FROM
HIS EX-WIFE.

957
00:45:27,990 --> 00:45:32,458
GREAT.
THE LAST THING THAT GUY NEEDS IS
ANOTHER MOUTH TO FEED.

958
00:45:39,065 --> 00:45:42,813
>> A UNITED AIRLINE'S FLIGHT
FROM GERMANY WAS FORCED TO
RETURN TO THE AIRPORT

959
00:45:42,813 --> 00:45:45,735
AFTER THE
TOILET BROKE AND LEAKED INTO THE
CABIN.

960
00:45:45,735 --> 00:45:51,123
THOUGH, IT'S THE PERFECT
PUNISHMENT FOR PEOPLE WHO TAKE
THEIR SHOES OFF ON PLANES.

961
00:45:53,301 --> 00:45:57,528
JANE GOODALL CELEBRATED HER 90th BIRTHDAY

962
00:45:57,528 --> 00:46:00,003
BY GATHERING TOGETHER
WITH 90 DOGS,

963
00:46:00,003 --> 00:46:03,443
THEN FEEDING THEM
ALL TO HER APES.

964
00:46:05,574 --> 00:46:09,688
>> IN A LAWSUIT AGAINST YE, A
FORMER EMPLOYEE CLAIMS

965
00:46:09,688 --> 00:46:13,609
THAT YE
COMPARED HIMSELF TO HITLER MINUS
THE GAS CHAMBERS.

966
00:46:13,609 --> 00:46:16,601
AND I FOR ONE AM SHOCKED TO HEAR
THAT YE

967
00:46:16,601 --> 00:46:19,305
BELIEVES IN THE
HOLOCAUST.

968
00:46:22,075 --> 00:46:26,407
>> THIS WEEK, LIVE WITH KELLY
AND MARK RERAN AN EPISODE FROM 2023

969
00:46:26,407 --> 00:46:30,091
IN WHICH HOST KELLY RIP PA
BEGS TO GO ON DIDDY'S YACHT.

970
00:46:30,091 --> 00:46:33,757
EVEN CRAZIER, SNL IS AIRING AN
EPISODE RIGHT NOW

971
00:46:33,757 --> 00:46:37,351
WITH A GUY WHO
WAS ON DIDDY'S YACHT LAST WEEK.

972
00:46:41,137 --> 00:46:43,659
>> WEATHER EXPERTS ARE
FORECASTING

973
00:46:43,659 --> 00:46:47,095
THAT THIS YEAR WILL
SEE THE HIGHEST NUMBER OF HURRICANES EVER

974
00:46:47,095 --> 00:46:51,428
THANKS TO AN
ABNORMALLY ACTIVE SUMMER OF GAY
WEDDINGS.

975
00:46:53,565 --> 00:46:58,213
A STONE VILE DISCOVERED IN IRAN
CONTAINED A RED COSMETIC

976
00:46:58,213 --> 00:47:03,053
THAT EXPERTS SAY
WAS LIKELY USED AS
LIPSTICK NEARLY 4,000 YEARS AGO

977
00:47:03,053 --> 00:47:05,856
BY AN ANCIENT SKANK.

978
00:47:08,385 --> 00:47:12,791
ISN'T THAT FASCINATING, COLIN?
>> I'M LEARNING A LOT.

979
00:47:12,791 --> 00:47:16,722
A MAN DIAGNOSED WITH
SCHIZOPHRENIA HAS BEEN GIVEN A SUPPORT DOG

980
00:47:16,722 --> 00:47:20,216
TO HELP HIM
DETERMINE WHAT IS REAL AND
WHAT'S A HALLUCINATION.

981
00:47:20,216 --> 00:47:24,112
THE CRAZIEST PART IS -- THERE'S
NO DOG.

982
00:47:26,106 --> 00:47:30,084
>> SCIENTISTS IN PORTUGAL HAVE
ACCIDENTALLY CREATED A MOUSE EMBRYO

983
00:47:30,084 --> 00:47:33,146
THAT HAS AN EXTRA LEG
WHERE ITS GENITALS SHOULD BE,

984
00:47:33,146 --> 00:47:35,841
AND BROTHER, SAME!

985
00:47:41,682 --> 00:47:42,960
ALL RIGHT.

986
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:47,028
>> YOURS IS THE SIZE OF A
MOUSE'S LEG?

987
00:47:47,028 --> 00:47:49,239
>> NO, NO.
WAIT, NO, NO.

988
00:47:49,239 --> 00:47:51,704
TAKE THAT JOKE BACK.
>> WE ALREADY LOCKED IT IN.

989
00:47:51,704 --> 00:47:56,272
WELL, THIS HAS BEEN A GREAT
SEASON FOR HIT MOVIES.

990
00:47:56,272 --> 00:48:00,620
HERE WITH HER OWN TAKES ON THE
MOVIES IS OUR OLD FRIEND, AUNT
LINDA.

991
00:48:06,230 --> 00:48:08,530
>> EASY.
EASY.

992
00:48:08,530 --> 00:48:11,721
>> ALL RIGHT.
AUNT LINDA, LONG TIME, NO SEE.

993
00:48:11,721 --> 00:48:16,754
>> WELL, HELLO, SETH.

994
00:48:18,346 --> 00:48:21,910
SOMEONE'S GOTTEN SOME WORK DONE.

995
00:48:21,910 --> 00:48:23,629
>> WELL, I'M ACTUALLY COLIN.

996
00:48:23,629 --> 00:48:25,792
YOU HAVEN'T BEEN HERE IN A
WHILE.
WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN UP TO?

997
00:48:25,792 --> 00:48:28,701
>> WELL, I'LL TELL YOU NOSEY
O'DONNELL.

998
00:48:28,701 --> 00:48:30,764
I GOT DIVORCED.

999
00:48:30,764 --> 00:48:33,407
MY HUSBAND FINALLY GOT HEARING AIDS,

1000
00:48:33,407 --> 00:48:35,235
TEN MINUTES LATER, HE WAS
ON A BUS.

1001
00:48:35,235 --> 00:48:38,797
>> OH, MY GOD.
I'M SO SORRY.

1002
00:48:38,797 --> 00:48:42,323
BUT WE'RE EXCITED FOR YOU TO
GIVE US THE LATEST TAKE ON ALL
THE HIT MOVIES OUT THERE.

1003
00:48:42,323 --> 00:48:43,831
>> WELL, MY PLEASURE.

1004
00:48:43,831 --> 00:48:46,241
OR SHOULD I SAY PAIN.

1005
00:48:46,592 --> 00:48:52,095
ANYONE ELSE SIT THROUGH THAT 90
MINUTES OF STINKO CALLED
BARBIE?

1006
00:48:52,095 --> 00:48:53,907
I DIDN'T GET IT.

1007
00:48:53,907 --> 00:48:57,679
IS SHE A DOLL THAT COMES TO
LIFE?
IT DIDN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.

1008
00:48:57,679 --> 00:49:00,963
AND WHERE ARE THEY?
ON THE MOON?

1009
00:49:01,411 --> 00:49:05,786
>> YEAH.
I MEAN, I DON'T THINK "BARBIE"
TOOK PLACE ON THE MOON.

1010
00:49:05,786 --> 00:49:07,356
>> YEAH.
AND THERE WAS SO MUCH PINK.

1011
00:49:07,356 --> 00:49:12,116
THE ONLY GOOD THING THAT CAME
OUT OF IT IS I WAS REMINDED TO
TAKE MY PEPTOBISMAL.

1012
00:49:12,116 --> 00:49:17,663
AND HEY, AMERICA FERRARI, SAVE
YOUR SPEECH FOR WOMEN'S LIVERS.

1013
00:49:17,663 --> 00:49:20,136
I LOVE WEARING A BRA.

1014
00:49:20,649 --> 00:49:24,162
>> I DON'T KNOW.
IT WAS A VERY POPULAR MOVIE.

1015
00:49:24,162 --> 00:49:25,878
>> WELL, I DON'T KNOW WHY.

1016
00:49:25,878 --> 00:49:29,885
AND THAT KEN CHARACTER, RYAN GOSLING,

1017
00:49:29,885 --> 00:49:33,459
MORE LIKE RYAN GOSLING.

1018
00:49:36,679 --> 00:49:39,570
>> I THINK YOU JUST SAID HIS
NAME THE SAME TWICE.

1019
00:49:39,570 --> 00:49:42,555
>> HE'S VAR HARD TO MAKE FUN OF.

1020
00:49:43,371 --> 00:49:49,290
>> I GIVE "BARBIE" A COUPLE OF
WHAT IN THE'S AND FOUR GAH.

1021
00:49:50,228 --> 00:49:54,211
THE NEXT FILM I WATCHED WAS ALSO
A BIG ONE.
CAN YOU TAKE A GUESS?

1022
00:49:54,211 --> 00:49:57,943
>> "OPPENHEIMER."
>> BINGO.

1023
00:49:57,943 --> 00:50:01,693
>> SO YOU DID NOT LIKE
OPPENHEIMER?
>> NOPENHEIMER.

1024
00:50:01,693 --> 00:50:04,819
DIRECTED BY CHRISTOPHER NO
THANKS.

1025
00:50:04,819 --> 00:50:10,318
WHY THE HECK WOULD ANYONE MAKE A
MOVIE ABOUT THE PERSON WHO
INVENTED THE MICROWAVE?

1026
00:50:12,264 --> 00:50:16,926
>> OKAY.
WELL, WHAT ELSE HAVE YOU WATCHED
THAT CONFUSED YOU?

1027
00:50:16,926 --> 00:50:20,155
>> DON'T GET SMART.

1028
00:50:21,995 --> 00:50:25,073
WELL, YOU'LL BE HAPPY TO KNOW I VENTURED

1029
00:50:25,073 --> 00:50:28,038
INTO THE LAND OF
TELEVISION ALONG WITH EVERYBODY
ELSE.

1030
00:50:28,038 --> 00:50:31,026
WHATEVER HAPPENED TO JUST
WATCHING MOVIES IN THE THEATER?

1031
00:50:31,026 --> 00:50:35,923
NOW EVERYONE STAYS HOME EATING
GRASS GUMMIES WATCHING MOVIES ON
THE TOILET.

1032
00:50:36,473 --> 00:50:40,663
>> ALL RIGHT.
SO WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN WATCHING
ON TV?

1033
00:50:40,663 --> 00:50:44,197
>> WELL, THERE WAS ONE SHOW WITH
A VERY MISLEADING TITLE.

1034
00:50:44,197 --> 00:50:47,551
>> WHAT WAS THAT?
>> THE BEAR.

1035
00:50:47,551 --> 00:50:51,098
I THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE
ABOUT BEARS LIVING IN THE WOODS

1036
00:50:51,098 --> 00:50:54,829
OR AT THE VERY LEAST, A SITCOM
ABOUT A HAYRY DOUGHY GAY MAN

1037
00:50:54,829 --> 00:50:57,600
WHO
HAS TO RAISE HIS SISTER'S KIDS.

1038
00:50:57,600 --> 00:51:01,370
SPOILER ALERT, IT'S ABOUT A
RESTAURANT.

1039
00:51:01,370 --> 00:51:04,773
WHY IS EVERYONE IN THE KITCHEN
SO UNORGANIZED?

1040
00:51:04,773 --> 00:51:10,191
HERE'S A NOVEL IDEA, HEY, CHEF,
STOP DOING SO MANY SITUPS IN
YOUR CALVIN CLINGERS

1041
00:51:10,191 --> 00:51:12,530
AND HIRE
MORE PEOPLE.

1042
00:51:12,901 --> 00:51:15,263
THEY'RE UNDERSTAFFED.

1043
00:51:15,263 --> 00:51:17,641
AND I DIDN'T LEARN HOW TO COOK
ONE THING.

1044
00:51:17,641 --> 00:51:21,253
RACHEL RAY WOULD BE ROLLING IN
HER GRAVE.

1045
00:51:21,253 --> 00:51:24,768
>> RACHEL RAY IS VERY MUCH
ALIVE.

1046
00:51:24,768 --> 00:51:27,651
>> WHERE DID YOU COME FROM?

1047
00:51:27,989 --> 00:51:30,335
>> I'VE BEEN HERE THE WHOLE
TIME.

1048
00:51:30,335 --> 00:51:34,021
>> WELL, I GIVE THE BEAR ONE BIG
FAT WHAT THE FUDGE

1049
00:51:34,021 --> 00:51:38,292
AND 15 WHAT'S
GOING ONES!

1050
00:51:38,292 --> 00:51:41,157
>> ALL RIGHT.
LINDA, BEFORE YOU LEAVE,

1051
00:51:41,157 --> 00:51:43,691
THERE'S
GOT TO BE ONE THING THAT YOU
LIKED.

1052
00:51:43,691 --> 00:51:46,002
>> NOT LIKED, LOVED.

1053
00:51:46,002 --> 00:51:50,213
I LAUGHED, I CRIED, I STARTED
AGAIN THE MINUTE IT WAS
FINISHED.

1054
00:51:50,213 --> 00:51:53,605
>> OH, MY GOD THE WHAT WAS THAT?
>> PAW PATROL.

1055
00:51:53,605 --> 00:51:57,305
DOGS SAVING THE WORLD IN
UNIFORMS?

1056
00:51:57,305 --> 00:52:01,477
HERE'S MY ALLY, AND THIS FILM
WENT STRAIGHT UP IT.

1057
00:52:01,477 --> 00:52:05,828
I GOT AN IDEA.
SEND THE PUPS TO CHOP VEGETABLES
OVER AT THE BEAR.

1058
00:52:05,828 --> 00:52:10,202
WHY IS HE SO UPSET?
HE FOUND A PUNCH OF MONEY IN THE
TOMATO SAUCE,

1059
00:52:10,202 --> 00:52:13,147
AND WHAT THE HECK
IS KINGERGY?

1060
00:52:13,147 --> 00:52:17,074
>> AUNT LINDA, EVERYONE.
>> NOW WHERE DO I GO?

1061
00:52:17,074 --> 00:52:21,530
>> FOR

1062
00:52:48,798 --> 00:52:53,035
TRACK.

1063
00:52:53,037 --> 00:52:56,372
WE GOT A CART STUCK OUT ON THE

1064
00:52:56,374 --> 00:52:57,673
TRACK RIGHT NOW.

1065
00:52:57,675 --> 00:52:59,475
FOR NOW, SIT TIGHT.

1066
00:52:59,477 --> 00:53:01,377
ONCE WE HAVE IT CLEARED OUT,

1067
00:53:01,379 --> 00:53:02,878
WE'LL BE ON OUR WAY.

1068
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:04,079
>> THIS DAY ROCKS.

1069
00:53:04,081 --> 00:53:06,682
WE RODE RIDES, PLAYED GAMES, AND

1070
00:53:06,684 --> 00:53:08,384
NOW WE'RE DOING GO KARTS?

1071
00:53:08,386 --> 00:53:09,785
MOM, DAD, THANKS SO MUCH FOR

00:53:09,787 --> 00:53:10,719

1075
00:53:14,191 --> 00:53:15,090

1080
00:53:23,834 --> 00:53:26,235

00:53:35,279 --> 00:53:36,178
>> OH, NO.

1086
00:53:36,180 --> 00:53:37,680
WHAT IS IT?

1087
00:53:37,682 --> 00:53:41,116
>> YOU JUST ENJOY THE GO KARTS.

1088
00:53:41,118 --> 00:53:43,652
YOU HAVE FUN THIS ONE MORE TIME,

1089

AND THEN AFTER THAT, YOUR FATHER

VERY BAD.

SO JUST A COUPLE THINGS TO GO

1109
00:54:15,586 --> 00:54:15,918
OVER.

1110
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:17,186
GAS IS ON THE RIGHT, BRAKE IS ON

1111
00:54:17,188 --> 00:54:20,622
THE LEFT, AND THERE'S ABSOLUTELY

1112
00:54:20,624 --> 00:54:21,657
NO BUMPING ALLOWED, ALL RIGHT?

1113
00:54:21,659 --> 00:54:23,592
>> OH, CHRIS, HIM SAYING NO

1114
00:54:23,594 --> 00:54:26,161
BUMPING REMINDS ME, WE STILL

1115
00:54:26,163 --> 00:54:28,230
HAVEN'T DONE THE BUMPER BOATS.

1116
00:54:28,232 --> 00:54:30,866
>> CRAP, YOU'RE RIGHT.

1117
00:54:30,868 --> 00:54:34,303
SON, WE STILL HAVE TO DO THE

1118
00:54:34,305 --> 00:54:34,737
BUMPER BOATS.

1119
00:54:34,739 --> 00:54:35,738
SO WOULD YOU RATHER HEAR IT

1120
00:54:35,740 --> 00:54:36,038
AFTER?

1121
00:54:36,040 --> 00:54:36,438
>> NEITHER.

1122
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:37,873
I WANT TO KNOW THE BAD THING

1123
00:54:37,875 --> 00:54:38,173
NOW.

1124
00:54:38,175 --> 00:54:40,142
>> YOU KNOW WHAT, WE SHOULDN'T

1125
00:54:40,144 --> 00:54:41,610
EVEN BE ASKING HIM SOMETHING

1126
00:54:41,612 --> 00:54:42,011
LIKE THAT.

1127
00:54:42,013 --> 00:54:42,878
>> YOU'RE RIGHT.

1128
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:44,947
IT SHOULDN'T BE UP TO HIM.

1129
00:54:44,949 --> 00:54:47,016
ASHLEY, SWEETIE, DADDY HAS A

1130
00:54:47,018 --> 00:54:48,650

DO YOU WANT TO DO GO KARTS, HEAR

1134
00:54:53,457 --> 00:54:56,592
THE BAD THING, THEN DO BUMPER

1135
00:54:56,594 --> 00:54:58,127
BOATS, OR BUMPER BOATS AND THEN

1136
00:54:58,129 --> 00:54:58,927
HEAR THE BAD THING?

1137
00:54:58,929 --> 00:55:00,496
>> I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR THE BAD

1138
00:55:00,498 --> 00:55:00,996
THING NOW.

1139
00:55:00,998 --> 00:55:03,132
>> YOU KNOW WHAT, LET'S JUST

1140
00:55:03,134 --> 00:55:04,666
PLAY IT BY EAR.

1141
00:55:04,668 --> 00:55:05,534
>> FINE WITH ME.

1142
00:55:05,536 --> 00:55:07,269
>> KIDS, WE'RE GOING TO JUST

1143
00:55:07,271 --> 00:55:10,005
PLAY TELLING YOU THE BAD THING

1144
00:55:10,007 --> 00:55:10,906
BY EAR, OKAY?

1145
00:55:10,908 --> 00:55:13,942
SO THE REST OF THE DAY, JUST BE

1146
00:55:13,944 --> 00:55:14,243
READY.

1147
00:55:14,245 --> 00:55:16,378
AT SOME POINT, WE'RE GOING TO

1148
00:55:16,380 --> 00:55:17,713
DROP IT ON YOU, OKAY?

1149
00:55:17,715 --> 00:55:18,447
>> WHAT?

1150
00:55:18,449 --> 00:55:20,482
>> JUST TELL US.

1151
00:55:20,484 --> 00:55:21,950
>> YOU KNOW WHAT, SHEILA SHOULD

1152
00:55:21,952 --> 00:55:23,452
REALLY BE HERE WHEN WE TELL

1153
00:55:23,454 --> 00:55:23,752
THEM.

1154
00:55:23,754 --> 00:55:24,620
>> YOU'RE RIGHT.

1155
00:55:24,622 --> 00:55:26,021
DO YOU THINK SHEILA WOULD COME

1156
00:55:26,023 --> 00:55:27,156
DOWN HERE AND MEET US.

1157
00:55:27,158 --> 00:55:29,425
>> I'LL GIVE HER A CALL.

1158
00:55:29,427 --> 00:55:29,825
LET'S ASK.

1159
00:55:29,827 --> 00:55:31,427
>> WHO IS SHEILA?

1160
00:55:31,429 --> 00:55:33,328
>> SHE'S PART OF THE BAD THING.

1161
00:55:33,330 --> 00:55:35,998
>> HEY, SHEILA, IT'S BIG C.

1162
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,200
CAN YOU MEET US AT FUN LAND,

1163
00:55:38,202 --> 00:55:40,869
HELP US BREAK THE NEWS TO THE

1164
00:55:40,871 --> 00:55:41,170
KIDS?

1165
00:55:41,172 --> 00:55:41,470
GREAT.

1166
00:55:41,472 --> 00:55:41,770
OKAY.

1167
00:55:41,772 --> 00:55:42,838
SEE YOU SOON.

1168
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:43,272
SHEILA'S IN.

1169
00:55:43,274 --> 00:55:45,007
>> DAD, WHO IS SHEILA?

1170
00:55:45,009 --> 00:55:46,508
>> JUST FORGET IT.

1171
00:55:46,510 --> 00:55:48,310
LET'S TALK ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE.

1172
00:55:48,312 --> 00:55:51,313
OH, FUN RANDOM QUESTION FOR YOU

1173
00:55:51,315 --> 00:55:51,613
KIDS.

1174
00:55:51,615 --> 00:55:53,415
IF YOUR FATHER AND I WERE ON

1175
00:55:53,417 --> 00:55:55,851
OPPOSITE ENDS OF A POOL, WHO DO

1176
00:55:55,853 --> 00:55:56,785
YOU THINK YOU WOULD SWIM TO?

1177
00:55:56,787 --> 00:55:58,087
>> WAIT, WHAT?

1178
00:55:58,089 --> 00:55:59,855
>> I HAVE A QUESTION.

1179
00:55:59,857 --> 00:56:01,790
HOW WOULD Y'ALL FEEL IF I

1180
00:56:01,792 --> 00:56:02,791
STARTED DRINKING AGAIN?

1181
00:56:02,793 --> 00:56:04,093
>> DAD, WHAT?

1182
00:56:04,095 --> 00:56:06,128
WHY WOULD YOU START DRINKING

1183
00:56:06,130 --> 00:56:06,428
AGAIN?

1184
00:56:06,430 --> 00:56:08,363
>> WELL, I DON'T WANT TO SPOIL

1185
00:56:08,365 --> 00:56:09,498
ANYTHING, BUT AFTER YOU HEAR THE

1186
00:56:09,500 --> 00:56:10,732
BAD THING, YOU'LL UNDERSTAND

1187
00:56:10,734 --> 00:56:11,033
WHY.

1188
00:56:11,035 --> 00:56:13,202
>> OKAY.

1189
00:56:13,204 --> 00:56:13,635
LOOK, ENOUGH.

1190
00:56:13,637 --> 00:56:15,604
MOM, DAD, PLEASE, JUST WHATEVER

1191
00:56:15,606 --> 00:56:17,906
THE BAD THING IS, TELL US.

1192
00:56:17,908 --> 00:56:18,507
WE CAN HANDLE IT.

1193
00:56:18,509 --> 00:56:19,374
>> OKAY.

1194
00:56:19,376 --> 00:56:19,675
FINE.

1195
00:56:19,677 --> 00:56:22,311

1196
00:56:22,313 --> 00:56:23,946
KIDS TO KNOW YOUR FATHER AND I

1197
00:56:23,948 --> 00:56:25,013
LOVE YOU, AND WE ALWAYS WILL.

1198
00:56:25,015 --> 00:56:29,451
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

1199
00:56:29,453 --> 00:56:31,487
AND NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS,

1200
00:56:31,489 --> 00:56:34,022
WE'RE STILL MOM AND DAD.

1201
00:56:34,024 --> 00:56:35,157
THAT'S NEVER GONNA CHANGE.

1202
00:56:35,159 --> 00:56:36,158
>> WE KNOW, DAD.

1203
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:36,658
>> OF COURSE, DAD.

1204
00:56:36,660 --> 00:56:39,228
>> OKAY.

1205
00:56:39,230 --> 00:56:40,596
THEN, HERE IT GOES.

1206
00:56:40,598 --> 00:56:43,398
