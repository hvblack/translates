UNIVERSITY PRESIDENTS

00:00:32,429 --> 00:00:35,299
>> CAN I JUST RESIGN NOW?

11
00:00:35,299 --> 00:00:36,556
>> NOT YET.

12
00:00:36,556 --> 00:00:39,901
AND THE PRESIDENT OF HARVARD,
DR. CLAUDINE GAY.

13
00:00:39,901 --> 00:00:41,119
>> THANK YOU.

14
00:00:41,119 --> 00:00:45,380
>> DR. GAY, WOULD YOU LIKE TO DO
A QUICK JOKE ABOUT YOUR NAME TO
GET IT OUT OF THE WAY?

15
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:51,090
>> I WOULD.
DR. GAY SOUNDS LIKE A MOLLY
TEALER ON FIRE ISLAND.

16
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:52,314
>> THANK YOU.

17
00:00:52,314 --> 00:00:57,029
NOW, I'LL TURN IT OVER TO MEG
SUPERSTAR ELISE STEFANIK FROM NEW YORK

18
00:00:57,029 --> 00:01:01,134
WHO'S BEEN PACING THE
HALLWAYS LISTENING TO LOSE
YOURSELF BY EMINEM.

19
00:01:01,134 --> 00:01:02,750
MS. STEFANIK.

20
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:04,851
>> THANK YOU, CHAIRWOMAN.

21
00:01:04,851 --> 00:01:09,469
I'M GOING TO START SCREAMING
QUESTIONS AT THESE WOMEN LIKE
I'M BILLY EICHNER.

22
00:01:09,469 --> 00:01:12,643
ANTI-SEMITISM, YEA OR NAY.

23
00:01:12,643 --> 00:01:14,393
>> I'M SORRY.
WHAT?

24
00:01:14,393 --> 00:01:17,537
>> YES OR NO, IS CALLING FOR JEWS

25
00:01:17,537 --> 00:01:20,343
AGAINST THE CODE OF CONDUCT
FOR HARVARD?

26
00:01:20,343 --> 00:01:23,026
>> WELL, IT DEPENDS ON THE
CONTEXT.

27
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:25,738
>> THAT CAN'T BE THE ANSWER.

28
00:01:25,738 --> 00:01:28,678
UPENN LADY, YES OR NO?

29
00:01:28,782 --> 00:01:32,545
>> WE ARE INTERESTED IN STOPPING
ALL FORMS OF HATRED,

30
00:01:32,545 --> 00:01:35,769
ANTI-SEMITISM, ISLAM PHOBIA.

31
00:01:36,353 --> 00:01:39,781
SECOND
CHANGE

32
00:01:39,781 --> 00:01:43,794
KEEP IN MIND:
IF YOU DON'T SAY YES, YOU'RE
GOING TO MAKE ME LOOK GOOD,

33
00:01:43,794 --> 00:01:46,439
WHICH IS REALLY HARD TO DO.

34
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:50,864
SO I'LL ASK YOU STRAIGHT UP.
DO YOU THINK GENOCIDE IS BAD?

35
00:01:50,864 --> 00:01:56,480
>> COULD I SUBMIT AN ANSWER IN
WRITING AT A LATER DATE?

36
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:59,837
>> AM I WINNING THIS HEARING?

37
00:01:59,837 --> 00:02:01,871
SOMEBODY PINCH ME.

38
00:02:01,871 --> 00:02:06,104
>> MS. STEFANIK, YOUR TIME IS
UP.
>> OH, THANK GOD.

39
00:02:06,104 --> 00:02:10,151
>> THE CHAIR RECOGNIZES
GENTLEMAN FROM MICHIGAN.

40
00:02:10,151 --> 00:02:12,380
>> THANK YOU.

41
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:16,939
I YIELD MY TIME BACK TO
MS. STEFANIK.
>> DAMN IT.

42
00:02:16,939 --> 00:02:22,348
>> I AM HERE TODAY BECAUSE HATE
SPEECH HAS NO PLACE ON COLLEGE
CAMPUSES.

43
00:02:22,436 --> 00:02:25,683
HATE SPEECH BELONGS IN CONGRESS,

44
00:02:25,683 --> 00:02:28,024
ON ELON MUSK'S TWITTER,

45
00:02:28,024 --> 00:02:30,962
IN PRIVATE DINNER WITH MY DONORS

46
00:02:30,962 --> 00:02:35,505
AND IN PUBLIC SPEECHES MY BY
WORK HUSBAND, DONALD TRUMP.

47
00:02:35,505 --> 00:02:39,594
SO DR. GAY, SIMPLE QUESTION,

48
00:02:39,594 --> 00:02:43,816
IS IT ACCEPTABLE FOR STUDENTS TO
USE ANTI-SEMITIC LANGUAGE?

49
00:02:43,816 --> 00:02:49,443
>> ON THIS SUBJECT, I WOULD LIKE
TO SPEAK NOT FROM THE HEART BUT
FROM THE THESAURUS.

50
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:53,899
THAT TYPE OF HATEFUL SPEECH IS
PERSONALLY ABHORRENT TO ME.

51
00:02:53,899 --> 00:02:57,890
>> COULD YOU PHRASE THAT IN AN
EVEN MORE ACADEMIC WAY?

52
00:02:57,890 --> 00:03:01,587
>> SURE.
THAT VARIETY OF ODIOUS

53
00:03:01,587 --> 00:03:04,867
IS
SLOW
RATION IS REPUGNANT.

54
00:03:04,868 --> 00:03:10,452
PROTECT

55
00:03:10,452 --> 00:03:13,941
WE'RE TALKING PRECAUTIONS TO
PROTECT ALL STUDENTS,

56
00:03:13,941 --> 00:03:17,226
JEWISH
STUDENTS, MUSLIM STUDENTS.

57
00:03:18,223 --> 00:03:22,218
>> AGAIN, UGH, JUST THE FIRST
ONE.

58
00:03:22,218 --> 00:03:27,791
THIS IS PERSONAL FOR ME.
WHILE I AM NOT JEWISH, I'M ROMAN CATHOLIC,

59
00:03:27,864 --> 00:03:32,819
SOME OF MY CLOSEST
FRIENDS ARE ALSO ROMAN CATHOLIC.

60
00:03:32,819 --> 00:03:36,325
SO UPENN LADY, WOULD YOU SAY
THAT YOU ARE

61
00:03:36,325 --> 00:03:41,263
ANTI, ANTI, ANTI, ANTI
ANTI-SEMITIC?

62
00:03:41,263 --> 00:03:45,218
>> I'M SORRY.
CAN YOU TELL ME HOW MANY ANTIS
THAT WAS?

63
00:03:45,285 --> 00:03:47,579
>> I WILL NOT.

64
00:03:47,579 --> 00:03:50,673
>> YOU'RE ASKING US QUESTIONS
THAT SEEM VERY UNFAIR.

65
00:03:50,673 --> 00:03:53,863
>> OH.
THANK YOU.

66
00:03:53,863 --> 00:03:58,099
>> THE CHAIR RECOGNIZES
MR. TAKANO FROM CALIFORNIA.

67
00:03:58,099 --> 00:03:59,863
>> THANK YOU, CHAIRWOMAN.

68
00:03:59,863 --> 00:04:05,441
SO TO CLEAR THINGS UP, WHAT DOES
VIOLATE THE CODE OF CONDUCT AT
YOUR SCHOOLS?

69
00:04:05,441 --> 00:04:10,283
WHAT ABOUT IF SOMEONE ON CAMPUS
YELLED, I POISONED THE WATER
SUPPLY?

70
00:04:10,283 --> 00:04:14,842
>> IF THEY POISONED IT WITH
DIVERSITY, THAT COULD BE
WONDERFUL.

71
00:04:14,842 --> 00:04:19,289
>> MM, DIVERSE WATER, IT SOUNDS
DELICIOUS.

72
00:04:19,289 --> 00:04:22,942
>> OKAY.
AND WHAT IF THEY YELLED, I'VE
GOT A KNIFE?

73
00:04:22,942 --> 00:04:26,337
>> WELL, MAYBE THEY HAVE A LISP,
AND THEY'RE SAYING,

74
00:04:26,337 --> 00:04:29,902
I HAVE A
KNIFE BOUQUET OF FLOWERS FOR
YOU.

75
00:04:29,902 --> 00:04:33,594
>> AS LONG AS THE FLOWERS ARE
DIVERSE, I ACCEPT.

76
00:04:33,594 --> 00:04:38,327
>> AND WHAT IF THEY YELLED FIRE
IN A CROWDED THEATER?

77
00:04:38,327 --> 00:04:43,451
>> I WOULD BE EXCITED THE
THEATER WAS CROWDED BECAUSE I
SUPPORT THE ARTS.

78
00:04:43,451 --> 00:04:48,926
>> OH, MY GOD.
CAN YOU TAKE A MORAL STANCE ON
ANYTHING?

79
00:04:48,926 --> 00:04:53,344
CAN ANYONE HERE SAY YES TO A
SINGLE QUESTION?

80
00:04:53,344 --> 00:04:55,636
>> YES, HELLO.

81
00:04:55,636 --> 00:05:00,086
I AM THE PRESIDENT OF THE
UNIVERSITY OF PHOENIX ONLINE.

82
00:05:00,387 --> 00:05:04,843
AND I AM WILLING TO SAY YES TO
ANYTHING.

83
00:05:05,386 --> 00:05:08,673
>> SEE?
SEE, FINALLY,

84
00:05:08,673 --> 00:05:12,128
A REAL PRESIDENT
OF A REAL UNIVERSITY.

85
00:05:12,128 --> 00:05:14,908
>> THAT'S ACTUALLY OUR SCHOOL
MOTTO.

86
00:05:14,908 --> 00:05:19,124
U OF P, WE ARE A REAL
UNIVERSITY.

87
00:05:19,124 --> 00:05:24,245
>> AND WILL YOU PROMISE TO
ELIMINATE ALL ANTI-SEMITISM FROM
YOUR CAMPUS?

88
00:05:24,245 --> 00:05:28,478
>> WELL, MY CAMPUS IS THE INTERNET,

89
00:05:28,478 --> 00:05:35,251
SO ANTI-SEMITISM IS
KIND OF OUR MOST POPULAR MAJOR.

90
00:05:35,251 --> 00:05:38,454
AND OUR MASCOT IS PORN.

91
00:05:38,454 --> 00:05:41,760
>> OKAY.
THEN WILL YOU OFFER A COURSE

92
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:44,668
EXPLAINING WHY ANTI-SEMITISM IS
WRONG?

93
00:05:44,668 --> 00:05:48,112
>> LADY, WE'LL OFFER A COURSE ON
ANYTHING.

94
00:05:48,112 --> 00:05:51,211
OUR ONLY MANDATORY COURSES ARE

95
00:05:51,211 --> 00:05:54,338
HOW TO LOG INTO THE UNIVERSITY OF PHOENIX ONLINE

96
00:05:54,338 --> 00:05:57,089
AND HOW TO SET
UP AUTOPAY.

97
00:05:57,089 --> 00:05:58,688
>> THANK YOU.

98
00:05:58,688 --> 00:06:02,550
SOMEHOW THAT WAS THE ONLY
STRAIGHT ANSWER I GOT ALL DAY.

99
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:05,537
>> WELL, PLEASE DON'T SAY THE
ANSWER WAS STRAIGHT.

100
00:06:05,537 --> 00:06:09,649
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THE ANSWER'S
SEXUAL ORIENTATION IS.

101
00:06:09,649 --> 00:06:12,402
>> THANK YOU.
THAT'S ALL THE TIME WE HAVE.

102
00:06:12,402 --> 00:06:15,635
THIS WAS ALL VERY USELESS.

103
00:06:15,635 --> 00:06:20,445
>> NOT FOR ME.
FOR ME, IT WAS VERY USEFUL.

104
00:06:20,445 --> 00:06:24,538
I HAD A GREAT TIME.
I'M THE HANUKKAH GIFT NO ONE
WANTED.

105
00:06:24,538 --> 00:06:28,868
AND LIVE FROM NEW YORK, IT'S
SATURDAY NIGHT!

106
00:08:34,663 --> 00:08:39,715
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, ADAM
DRIVER!

107
00:08:54,251 --> 00:08:56,974
>>> HELLO.

108
00:08:58,225 --> 00:09:01,426
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

109
00:09:01,426 --> 00:09:03,880
I'M SO EXCITED TO BE BACK!

110
00:09:04,584 --> 00:09:08,312
ESPECIALLY DURING THIS TIME OF
YEAR.

111
00:09:08,312 --> 00:09:11,268
I LOVE CHRISTMAS.
IT'S MY FAVORITE HOLIDAY.

112
00:09:11,268 --> 00:09:13,884
THE FOOD, THE MUSIC, THE FAMILY.

113
00:09:13,884 --> 00:09:17,102
BUT LARGELY, IT'S BECAUSE I HAVE
A VERY DEEP

114
00:09:17,102 --> 00:09:19,833
AND PERSONAL
RELATIONSHIP WITH SANTA.

115
00:09:19,833 --> 00:09:23,740
AND EVERY YEAR, I MAKE MY
CHRISTMAS LIST AND I TELL IT TO
HIM.

116
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:26,740
IT'S KIND OF OUR RITUAL.
USUALLY I DO IT IN PRIVATE,

117
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:30,129
BUT
SINCE WE'RE HERE AND I KNOW
SANTA WATCHES SNL.

118
00:09:30,129 --> 00:09:33,784
HE HASN'T LIKED IT SINCE KATTAN
LEFT.

119
00:09:33,784 --> 00:09:35,589
BUT IF YOU DON'T MIND,

120
00:09:35,589 --> 00:09:40,366
I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE MY CHRISTMAS LIST
RIGHT NOW IF THAT'S OKAY.

121
00:09:43,417 --> 00:09:44,578
I'LL TAKE THAT.

122
00:09:44,578 --> 00:09:47,906
THE PIANO IS PART OF THE RITUAL.
HE LOVES HEARING ME PLAY,

123
00:09:47,906 --> 00:09:52,057
AND
IT'S ACTUALLY ME PLAYING.
CAN WE GET A CLOSEUP OF MY
HANDS?

124
00:09:52,057 --> 00:09:55,857
SEE, THEY'RE VERY BIG.
VERY BIG HANDS.

125
00:10:04,581 --> 00:10:07,522
I MEAN, THAT'S PRETTY GOOD, HUH?

126
00:10:09,492 --> 00:10:10,850
OKAY.
THANK YOU.

127
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:13,679
IF YOU DON'T MIND, I WOULD LIKE
TO TALK TO SANTA NOW.

128
00:10:19,726 --> 00:10:22,215
HEY, SANTA!

129
00:10:22,356 --> 00:10:24,424
OH, RIGHT.
WE'RE ON TV.

130
00:10:24,424 --> 00:10:26,751
HEY, SANTA.

131
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:30,668
IT'S ME, ADAM.
DRIVER.

132
00:10:30,641 --> 00:10:33,131
FROM THE NICE LIST.

133
00:10:33,131 --> 00:10:36,163
AND ALSO GIRLS.

134
00:10:36,688 --> 00:10:39,164
I TURN 40 THIS YEAR, SANTA.

135
00:10:39,164 --> 00:10:42,269
SO I WOULD LIKE FIVE PAIRS OF
CHINOS.

136
00:10:42,269 --> 00:10:46,786
I ALSO WANT ONE OF THOSE GIANT
METAL TESLA TRUCKS.

137
00:10:46,786 --> 00:10:51,257
I THINK IT WOULD PAIR PERFECTLY
WITH MY TEENY TINY MICRO PENIS.

138
00:10:52,154 --> 00:10:57,419
OH, AND I WOULD LIKE PEOPLE TO
STOP COMING UP TO ME ON THE
STREET SAYING YOU KILLED HAN
SOLO.

139
00:10:57,419 --> 00:11:01,732
I DIDN'T KILL HIM, WOKENESS
KILLED HAN SOLO.

140
00:11:01,732 --> 00:11:04,901
LET'S SEE.
WHAT ELSE DO I WANT?

141
00:11:04,982 --> 00:11:10,125
OH, YOU KNOW THOSE TIKTOKS
THAT'S LIKE THOSE COUPLES THAT
DO PRANKS ON EACH OTHER?

142
00:11:10,125 --> 00:11:12,624
CAN YOU KILL THOSE PEOPLE?

143
00:11:14,003 --> 00:11:16,957
I KNOW.
I KNOW.

144
00:11:16,957 --> 00:11:22,409
OKAY.
NOW IT'S PART OF THE RITUAL
WHERE I PLAY OH HOLY NIGHT

145
00:11:22,409 --> 00:11:26,083
WHERE MAKING UNBREAKABLE EYE CONTACT
WITH THE CAMERA.

146
00:11:33,752 --> 00:11:37,006
ACTUALLY, THAT'S REALLY HARD.
I'M NOT GOING TO DO THAT
ANYMORE.

147
00:11:39,588 --> 00:11:42,850
OH, YOU KNOW WHAT I WANT FOR CHRISTMAS

148
00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:45,069
IS A GINGER BREAD
HOUSE.

149
00:11:45,069 --> 00:11:47,593
DO YOU THINK A GINGER BREAD MAN
GETS SCARED

150
00:11:47,593 --> 00:11:51,245
WHEN HE REALIZES THE
HOUSE IS MADE OF HIS OWN SKIN?

151
00:11:51,245 --> 00:11:54,224
THAT'S A CUTE ONE.
YOU CAN TELL YOUR KIDS THAT ONE.

152
00:11:54,224 --> 00:11:59,024
I SHOULD ALSO SAY ANOTHER THING
I LOVE ABOUT CHRISTMAS IS
EGGNOG.

153
00:11:59,024 --> 00:12:00,964
IT'S MY FAVORITE WAY TO HAVE
EGG.

154
00:12:00,964 --> 00:12:05,509
WHENEVER I GO TO A DINER AND
THEY SAY HOW WOULD YOU LIKE YOUR
EGGS, I SAY NOGGED.

155
00:12:05,786 --> 00:12:08,928
OKAY, SANTA.
THANK YOU FOR LISTENING.

156
00:12:08,928 --> 00:12:12,957
I LOOK FORWARD TO YOU BREAKING
INTO MY HOUSE.

157
00:12:12,957 --> 00:12:15,585
I TOTALLY FORGOT.

158
00:12:15,585 --> 00:12:17,457
I GOT YOU A GIFT THIS YEAR.

159
00:12:17,457 --> 00:12:21,427
IT'S MY NEW MOVIE "FERRARI"
WHICH OPENS CHRISTMAS DAY.

160
00:12:21,427 --> 00:12:25,148
YOU'RE WELCOME.
MERRY CHRISTMAS, SANTA.
BIG FINISH.

161
00:12:29,664 --> 00:12:31,892
IT'S ALMOST DONE.

162
00:12:36,514 --> 00:12:39,010
MERRY CHRISTMAS, SANTA!

163
00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:43,749
WE GOT A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU
TONIGHT.
OLIVIA RODRIGO I HERE!

164
00:12:43,749 --> 00:12:47,101

165
00:12:58,826 --> 00:13:03,763
IS.

166
00:13:03,765 --> 00:13:04,264
>> YEAH.

167
00:13:04,266 --> 00:13:06,533
WE GOT TO DO THESE ADULT ONLY

168
00:13:06,535 --> 00:13:07,467
SKI TRIPS MORE OFTEN.

169
00:13:07,469 --> 00:13:09,502
>> NOT GOING TO CHECK MY PHONE.

170
00:13:09,504 --> 00:13:11,504
SHE'S WITH THE SITTER.

171
00:13:11,506 --> 00:13:11,905
SHE'S FINE.

172
00:13:11,907 --> 00:13:13,239
>> HONEY, HOW ARE YOU GOING TO

173
00:13:13,241 --> 00:13:15,041
COPE WHEN THERE'S TWO OF THEM?

174
00:13:15,043 --> 00:13:18,311
>> OH, MY GOD.

175
00:13:18,313 --> 00:13:20,079
ARE YOU PREGNANT AGAIN?

176
00:13:20,081 --> 00:13:21,948
>> WE'RE NOT PREGNANT YET, BUT

177
00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:23,349
WE'RE TRYING FOR ANOTHER ONE.

178
00:13:23,351 --> 00:13:25,251
>> THAT'S SO GREAT, GUYS.

179
00:13:25,253 --> 00:13:26,085
>> YEAH.

180
00:13:26,087 --> 00:13:27,720
DON'T COME NOTHING ON OUR DOOR

181
00:13:27,722 --> 00:13:28,087
TONIGHT.

182
00:13:28,089 --> 00:13:30,223
>> AWW.

183
00:13:30,225 --> 00:13:32,225
>> DANIEL, SINCE WE'RE ON THE

184
00:13:32,227 --> 00:13:33,393
TOPIC, SHOULD WE TELL THEM?

185
00:13:33,395 --> 00:13:35,361
>> OH, WELL, WE WEREN'T GOING TO

186
00:13:35,363 --> 00:13:37,664
SAY IT, BUT LET'S JUST TELL

187
00:13:37,666 --> 00:13:37,964
THEM.

188
00:13:37,966 --> 00:13:41,000
>> WE'RE TRYING TO HAVE A BABY

189
00:13:41,002 --> 00:13:41,301
TOO.

190
00:13:41,303 --> 00:13:42,202
>> OH, THAT'S GREAT.

191
00:13:42,204 --> 00:13:43,102
>> SO EXCITING.

192
00:13:43,104 --> 00:13:46,005
>> I'M SO, SO HAPPY FOR YOU.

193
00:13:46,007 --> 00:13:47,040
SO TELL ALL NOW.

194
00:13:47,042 --> 00:13:48,408
WHAT'S YOUR PLAN?

195
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:50,677
ARE YOU GOING TO ADOPT?

196
00:13:50,679 --> 00:13:52,212
>> NO.

197
00:13:52,214 --> 00:13:53,680
WE'RE JUST GONNA TRY.

198
00:13:53,682 --> 00:13:55,782
>> SO THEN YOU'RE DOING THE

199
00:13:55,784 --> 00:13:56,950
SURROGATE ROUTE.

200
00:13:56,952 --> 00:13:57,417
THAT'S GREAT.

201
00:13:57,419 --> 00:14:00,286
>> HUH, SURROGACY, WELL, MAYBE

202
00:14:00,288 --> 00:14:02,755
DOWN THE LINE, BUT FOR NOW,

203
00:14:02,757 --> 00:14:05,692
WE'RE JUST GONNA TRY.

204
00:14:05,694 --> 00:14:08,027
>> SO DON'T COME KNOCKING ON OUR

205
00:14:08,029 --> 00:14:08,428
DOOR EITHER.

206
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:11,364
>> AWW.

207
00:14:11,366 --> 00:14:12,966
>> SO ARE YOU TWO JUST STRAIGHT

208
00:14:12,968 --> 00:14:13,933
UP HAVING SEX?

209
00:14:13,935 --> 00:14:17,737
>> I MEAN, WE'RE NOT JUST HAVING

210
00:14:17,739 --> 00:14:18,004
SEX.

211
00:14:18,006 --> 00:14:18,805
WE'RE GETTING A LITTLE HELP.

212
00:14:18,807 --> 00:14:21,774
AFTER JACOB IS DONE, I'M

213
00:14:21,776 --> 00:14:23,209
THROWING MY LEGS UP, HANGING OFF

214
00:14:23,211 --> 00:14:25,278
THE BAR AND LETTING GRAVITY DO

215
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:25,678
ITS THING.

216
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,847
>> NOBODY ASK ME TO GO INTO THE

217
00:14:27,849 --> 00:14:29,616
HOT TUB TONIGHT, I'M NOT BOILING

218
00:14:29,618 --> 00:14:30,316
MY BALLS.

219
00:14:30,318 --> 00:14:30,950
>> RIGHT.

220
00:14:30,952 --> 00:14:32,852
SO HOW IS THE TRYING GOING?

221
00:14:32,854 --> 00:14:33,419
>> GOOD.

222
00:14:33,421 --> 00:14:33,886
GOOD.

223
00:14:33,888 --> 00:14:35,188
I THINK WE'RE GETTING REALLY

224
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:35,521
CLOSE.

225
00:14:35,523 --> 00:14:37,290
>> YEAH, YEAH, MY BODY IS

226
00:14:37,292 --> 00:14:38,424
ALREADY CHANGING.

227
00:14:38,426 --> 00:14:40,927
THIS COULD BE IN MY HEAD, BUT I

228
00:14:40,929 --> 00:14:42,428
JUST NEED CERTAIN FOODS.

229
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:44,797
WHEN YOU WERE PREGNANT, WERE YOU

230
00:14:44,799 --> 00:14:47,767
RANDOMLY CRAVING HAM AND

231
00:14:47,769 --> 00:14:48,101
COCAINE?

232
00:14:48,103 --> 00:14:48,735
>> NO.

233
00:14:48,737 --> 00:14:50,403
BUT THAT DOES BRING UP MORE

234
00:14:50,405 --> 00:14:50,937
QUESTIONS FOR ME.

235
00:14:50,939 --> 00:14:52,138
>> OKAY.

236
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:52,438
FINE.

237
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,072
LADY, WE KNOW.

238
00:14:53,074 --> 00:14:54,574
THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM.

239
00:14:54,576 --> 00:14:55,842
>> WHOO, OKAY.

240
00:14:55,844 --> 00:14:57,610
WE THOUGHT YOU WEREN'T GOING TO

241
00:14:57,612 --> 00:14:58,011
MENTION IT.

242
00:14:58,013 --> 00:15:00,813
>> DANIEL IS 34, SO THE

243
00:15:00,815 --> 00:15:05,318
PREGNANCY WOULD TECHNICALLY BE A

244
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:05,718
GERIATRIC.

245
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,453
>> I GUESS THE PREGNANCY PART IS

246
00:15:07,455 --> 00:15:08,588
WHAT'S CONFUSING.

247
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:09,856
>> LET ME EXPLAIN.

248
00:15:09,858 --> 00:15:13,059
FOR NOW, FOR US, IT'S ABOUT WHAT

249
00:15:13,061 --> 00:15:14,294
FEELS GOOD FOR US.

250
00:15:14,296 --> 00:15:16,496
AND FOR NOW, FOR US, WHAT FEELS

251
00:15:16,498 --> 00:15:19,399
GOOD FOR US IS FOR US TO TRY.

252
00:15:19,401 --> 00:15:21,267
>> BECAUSE FOR US, FOR NOW, WHAT

253
00:15:21,269 --> 00:15:22,969
FEELS GOOD FOR NOW IS TRYING,

254
00:15:22,971 --> 00:15:23,436
FOR US.

255
00:15:23,438 --> 00:15:24,904
>> FOR NOW.

256
00:15:24,906 --> 00:15:26,306
>> GOT IT.

257
00:15:26,308 --> 00:15:27,907
SO WHY DID YOU GUYS DECIDE TO

258
00:15:27,909 --> 00:15:28,975
START TRYING NOW?

259
00:15:28,977 --> 00:15:31,811
>> WELL, FUNNY ENOUGH I HAD A

260
00:15:31,813 --> 00:15:33,746
DREAM WHERE MY SON CAME OUT OF

261
00:15:33,748 --> 00:15:36,749
MY ASS, WHICH DIDN'T MAKE ANY

262
00:15:36,751 --> 00:15:37,083
SENSE.

263
00:15:37,085 --> 00:15:38,017
>> NO.

264
00:15:38,019 --> 00:15:38,284
NO.

265
00:15:38,286 --> 00:15:40,186
>> NO, IT DOESN'T.

266
00:15:40,188 --> 00:15:40,653
>> RIGHT.

267
00:15:40,655 --> 00:15:42,055
BECAUSE THE BABY IS OBVIOUSLY

268
00:15:42,057 --> 00:15:43,690
GOING TO COME OUT OF MY ASS.

269
00:15:43,692 --> 00:15:44,557
>> NO.

270
00:15:44,559 --> 00:15:45,458
THAT WON'T HAPPEN.

271
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:46,893
>> CAN YOU JUST EXPLAIN EXACTLY

272
00:15:46,895 --> 00:15:48,494
HOW YOU THINK YOU'RE TRYING FOR

273
00:15:48,496 --> 00:15:49,896
A BABY?

274
00:15:49,898 --> 00:15:50,596
>> OKAY.

275
00:15:50,598 --> 00:15:52,699
GOD GOD, THIS IS SO INVASIVE.

276
00:15:52,701 --> 00:15:54,100
PEOPLE THINK THEY CAN JUST ASK

277
00:15:54,102 --> 00:15:55,001
GAY PEOPLE ANYTHING.

278
00:15:55,003 --> 00:15:55,968
IT'S CRAZY.

279
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:58,905
>> LOOK, ALL WE FEEL COMFORTABLE

280
00:15:58,907 --> 00:16:02,108
SHARING IS WE'VE TRIED THREE OUT

281
00:16:02,110 --> 00:16:02,608
OF SEVEN HOLES.

282
00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:03,643
>> SEVEN HOLES?

283
00:16:03,645 --> 00:16:05,345
>> WE ARE NOT GOING TO HOLD YOUR

284
00:16:05,347 --> 00:16:05,978
HAND THROUGH THAT.

285
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:08,214
>> EARS, EYES, PITS, CRACK --

286
00:16:08,216 --> 00:16:11,317
>> BABY, DON'T.

287
00:16:11,319 --> 00:16:11,818
THEY CAN GOOGLE.

288
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:14,220
>> GUYS, WE LOVE YOU, BUT YOU

289
00:16:14,222 --> 00:16:15,588
TWO CAN'T HAVE A BABY.

290
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:16,756
YOU BIOLOGICALLY CANNOT.

291
00:16:16,758 --> 00:16:17,857
>> OH, REALLY?

292
00:16:17,859 --> 00:16:20,393
WELL, YEARS BEFORE THERE WERE

293
00:16:20,395 --> 00:16:23,329
PHONES, I'M SURE SOMEONE SAID WE

294
00:16:23,331 --> 00:16:25,098
CAN'T HAVE PHONES, WE'LL NEVER

295
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:28,067
HAVE PHONES, AND NOW WE HAVE

296
00:16:28,069 --> 00:16:28,401
PHONES.

297
00:16:28,403 --> 00:16:28,701
GIRL.

298
00:16:28,703 --> 00:16:29,936
>> THINGS IN THE SCIENCE

299
00:16:29,938 --> 00:16:31,304
COMMUNITY CHANGE SO FAST.

300
00:16:31,306 --> 00:16:34,474
YEARS FROM NOW, YOU'RE GOING TO

301
00:16:34,476 --> 00:16:36,843
FEEL SO SMALL-MINDED.

302
00:16:36,845 --> 00:16:38,010
IMAGINE GOING BACK TO THE

303
00:16:38,012 --> 00:16:40,046
PILGRIMS AND TRYING TO EXPLAIN

304

ANDY MILLINACAS.

305
00:16:42,784 --> 00:16:44,817
BY THE WAY, MY BIRTHDAY IS

00:17:09,644 --> 00:17:11,878
>> I WISHED THAT WE GET PREGNANT

319
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,212
AND THEY NEVER DO.

320
00:17:13,214 --> 00:17:13,880
>> HEY!

321
00:17:13,882 --> 00:17:14,680
THAT'S NOT NICE.

322
00:17:14,682 --> 00:17:17,216
>> YOU ALREADY HAVE ONE AND HE'S

323
00:17:17,218 --> 00:17:17,550
AWFUL.

324
00:17:17,552 --> 00:17:18,050
>> SHE'S A GIRL.

325
00:17:18,052 --> 00:17:21,154
>> WELL, THEN SHE LOOKS GAY.

326
00:17:21,156 --> 00:17:21,421
EWW.

327
00:17:21,423 --> 00:17:23,556
>> EVERYONE, I ACTUALLY HAVE

328
00:17:23,558 --> 00:17:24,123
ANNOUNCEMENT TO MAKE.

329
00:17:24,125 --> 00:17:26,159
>> OH, WHAT IS IT, SWEETIE?

330
00:17:26,161 --> 00:17:28,594
>> I'M EXPECTING.

331
00:17:28,596 --> 00:17:29,629
>> YOU'RE PREGNANT?

332
00:17:29,631 --> 00:17:31,030
>> NO.

333
00:17:31,032 --> 00:17:32,932
I'M JUST EXPECTING TO HAVE A

334
00:17:32,934 --> 00:17:33,833
BABY SOME DAY.

335
00:17:33,835 --> 00:17:34,567
>> SEE, NOW THAT'S CONFUSING.

336
00:17:34,569 --> 00:17:35,141
>> GIRL.

337
00:17:35,914 --> 00:17:36,084
>> HE JUST FELL ASLEEP.

338
00:17:50,653 --> 00:17:54,195
OLD

339
00:18:02,106 --> 00:18:05,291
>> OH, MY GOD.

340
00:18:05,539 --> 00:18:10,765
MY MOM HAS NOT CHANGED THIS ROOM
SINCE I LEFT FOR COLLEGE.

341
00:18:10,765 --> 00:18:13,261
>> OH, LOOK AT YOU.

342
00:18:13,261 --> 00:18:16,139
WHO'S THIS?
>> OH, THAT'S KEITH.

343
00:18:16,139 --> 00:18:19,488
HE WAS MY BEST FRIEND GROWING
UP.
HE LIVED A FEW DOORS DOWN.

344
00:18:19,488 --> 00:18:23,880
MAN, I HAVEN'T SEEN KEITH IN
LIKE 15 YEARS.

345
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,131
>> WELL, YOU SHOULD REACH OUT.

346
00:18:25,131 --> 00:18:28,289
IT'S ALWAYS NICE TO HEAR FROM AN
OLD FRIEND AT CHRISTMAS.

347
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:42,526
>> HEY, KEITH, IT'S JAKE.

348
00:18:42,526 --> 00:18:46,584
IT'S BEEN FOREVER, MAN.
WANNA GRAB A BEER TONIGHT?

349
00:18:50,795 --> 00:18:53,218
>> JAKE MITCHELL?
WOW.

350
00:18:53,218 --> 00:18:55,944
I WOULD LOVE THAT.
WHERE DO YOU WANT TO GO?

351
00:18:55,944 --> 00:18:57,137
>> FENNIGAN'S?

352
00:18:57,137 --> 00:18:59,455
>> SEE.
IT ALWAYS PAYS TO REACH OUT.

353
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:01,824
>> THAT'S NOT A GAY BAR, RIGHT?

354
00:19:03,646 --> 00:19:06,450
>> I DON'T THINK SO.
IT'S JUST A BAR.

355
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:09,585
>> IS IT MORE THAN A THOUSAND
FEET FROM A SCHOOL?

356
00:19:11,156 --> 00:19:13,390
>> KEITH.

357
00:19:14,255 --> 00:19:15,665
LOL.

358
00:19:15,665 --> 00:19:17,605
>> SILLY FACE EMOJI.

359
00:19:17,605 --> 00:19:19,374
>> OKAY.

360
00:19:19,374 --> 00:19:23,046
>> FOR REAL, THOUGH, IS IT MORE
THAN 1,000 FEET FROM A SCHOOL?

361
00:19:23,046 --> 00:19:25,998
>> PROBABLY.
>> I'M IN.

362
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:29,909
HEY, IT MEANS A LOT THAT YOU
REACHED OUT, MAN, FOR REAL.

363
00:19:29,909 --> 00:19:32,444
>> OF COURSE.

364
00:19:32,444 --> 00:19:37,445
>> MOST OF MY FRIENDS CUT TIES
AFTER ALL THAT STUFF WENT DOWN
LAST YEAR.

365
00:19:37,445 --> 00:19:40,993
>> WHAT STUFF?
>> BUNCH OF BS.

366
00:19:40,993 --> 00:19:43,728
A NETFLIX DOC MADE IT SEEM WORSE
THAN IT WAS.

367
00:19:43,728 --> 00:19:47,194
>> BABE, GO ON NETFLIX AND
SEARCH KEITH LONDALE.

368
00:19:47,194 --> 00:19:50,090
THE MAN WITH 600 KIDS.

369
00:19:50,090 --> 00:19:55,876
HOW A SPERM BANK JANITOR
SECRETLY SWITCHED HUNDREDS OF
DONOR SAMPLES WITH HIS OWN

370
00:19:55,876 --> 00:19:57,520
AND
GOT AWAY WITH IT.

371
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,093
GOD

372
00:19:59,093 --> 00:20:03,863
>> ANYWAY, I'VE BEEN PRETTY
LONELY.
I LOST THE LOVE OF MY LIFE LAST
YEAR.

373
00:20:03,863 --> 00:20:06,055
>> I'M SO SORRY.

374
00:20:06,055 --> 00:20:08,746
>> HERE'S MY FAVE PIC OF US.

375
00:20:10,277 --> 00:20:15,846
IT'S CRAZY THEY CAN JUST TAKE A
GUN AWAY FROM YOU BECAUSE OF
WHAT YOU SAY ONLINE.

376
00:20:19,256 --> 00:20:23,219
>> YOU SENT A THUMBS UP TO THAT?
>> WHAT WAS I SUPPOSED TO SAY?

377
00:20:23,219 --> 00:20:25,217
>> ANYWAY, CAN'T WAIT TO HANG.

378
00:20:25,217 --> 00:20:29,073
I HAVE SO MUCH TO TELL YOU
ABOUT.

379
00:20:33,081 --> 00:20:36,845
PICK YOU UP IN A FEW.
HAVE TO UBER, THOUGH.
NO LICENSE.

380
00:20:36,845 --> 00:20:39,043
>> OH, DUI?

381
00:20:39,043 --> 00:20:41,020
>> NAH, CAN'T RENEW IT.

382
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:43,788
DMV IS WITHIN 1,000 FEET OF A
SCHOOL.

383
00:20:43,788 --> 00:20:45,612
>> DUDE.

384
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:48,678
>> OKAY.
WE'RE ON OUR WAY.

385
00:20:48,678 --> 00:20:52,492
>> WE?
>> ME AND BIG FILTHY.

386
00:20:53,325 --> 00:20:58,017
>> WHO IS BIG FILTHY?
>> I DON'T KNOW.
HIS FRIEND, I GUESS?

387
00:20:58,017 --> 00:20:59,390
>> CALL ME.

388
00:20:59,390 --> 00:21:03,066
I HAVE A WAY WE CAN MAKE 30 K
TONIGHT.

389
00:21:03,066 --> 00:21:05,099
YOU ALLERGIC TO LATEX?

390
00:21:05,099 --> 00:21:08,499
>> WHO IS BIG FILTHY?

391
00:21:08,883 --> 00:21:11,966
>> NOT TO BE CORNY, BUT SOME OF
MY BEST MEMORIES

392
00:21:11,966 --> 00:21:14,591
ARE HANGING OUT
WITH YOU AT YOUR MOM'S.

393
00:21:19,872 --> 00:21:22,959
BY THE WAY, DOES SHE STILL HAVE
BIG ONES?

394
00:21:22,959 --> 00:21:26,931
OH, MY GOD.
SORRY.
TYPO.

395
00:21:27,655 --> 00:21:29,276
BIG TITTIES.

396
00:21:29,276 --> 00:21:34,605
>> OH, MY GOD.
HOW DID I NOT KNOW KEITH'S A
FULL PSYCHO NOW.

397
00:21:34,605 --> 00:21:37,336
>> BECAUSE YOU NEVER GO ON --

398
00:21:37,336 --> 00:21:39,664
>> FACEBOOK.
STILL THE BEST WAY TO SEE

399
00:21:39,664 --> 00:21:42,299
WHICH
OLD FRIENDS ARE CRAZY NOW.

400
00:21:47,057 --> 00:21:50,868
JACKSON

401
00:21:50,945 --> 00:21:59,183
>> OH, THEY'RE FINE.

402
00:21:59,185 --> 00:22:02,319
>> HEY, GENIE, NOT TO BE A PIG,

403
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:05,389
BUT YOU GOT AN ETA ON DINNER

404
00:22:05,391 --> 00:22:05,690
TIME?

405
00:22:05,692 --> 00:22:06,991
>> EVERYTHING LOOKS SO GOOD.

406
00:22:06,993 --> 00:22:08,526
>> WHEN CAN WE EAT?

407
00:22:08,528 --> 00:22:10,394
>> DON'T ASK ME.

408
00:22:10,396 --> 00:22:11,195
THAT'S MARK'S DEPARTMENT.

409
00:22:11,197 --> 00:22:12,496
>> OH, BEEP BEEP.

410
00:22:12,498 --> 00:22:14,331

ALL GOOD.

414
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:18,736
>> HOW MUCH LONGER DO YOU THINK

415
00:22:18,738 --> 00:22:19,503

OKAY?

420
00:22:25,478 --> 00:22:26,544
>> WELL, IF THAT HAM GOES

421
00:22:26,546 --> 00:22:33,451
MISSING, GREGG DID IT.

MERRY CHRISTMAS TO ALL.

00:22:37,156 --> 00:22:38,022
SORRY WE'RE LATE.

425
00:22:38,024 --> 00:22:39,390
>> OH, DON'T BE.

426
00:22:39,392 --> 00:22:40,391
YOU DIDN'T MISS NOTHING.

427
00:22:40,393 --> 00:22:41,358
WE WERE JUST ABOUT TO START.

428
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,794

>> EVERYTHING'S FINE, SWEETIE.

460
00:23:46,626 --> 00:23:49,860
I SAID, BEEP BEEP.

461
00:23:49,862 --> 00:23:54,064

>> NO, NO, NO, NO.

464
00:23:58,204 --> 00:24:00,070
I DON'T THINK YOU UNDERSTAND.

465

A CARRAWAY LITTLER THAN YOURS.

472
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:21,559

THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
GOOD EVENING, EVERYONE.

863
00:37:53,507 --> 00:37:57,372
A FEDERAL INDICTMENT ISSUED THIS
WEEK AGAINST HUNTER BIDE AN LEDGES

864
00:37:57,372 --> 00:38:02,862
THAT HE EVADED PAYING
OVER $1 MILLION OF TAXES BETWEEN
2016 AND 2020,

865
00:38:02,862 --> 00:38:05,133
AND THEY'RE ONLY
CATCHING HIM NOW?

866
00:38:05,133 --> 00:38:07,468
MAN, THIS IS SUPER EMBARRASSING

867
00:38:07,468 --> 00:38:11,990
FOR WHOEVER WAS PRESIDENT FROM
2016 TO 2020.

868
00:38:13,479 --> 00:38:16,233
THE INDICTMENT CLAIMS THAT
INSTEAD OF PAYING TAXES,

869
00:38:16,233 --> 00:38:19,270
HE
SPENT HIS MONEY ON DRUGS AND
ESCORTS.

870
00:38:19,270 --> 00:38:24,391
HONESTLY, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN
MORE SURPRISING IF HE REMEMBERS
TO DO HIS TAXES DURING THAT
TIME.

871
00:38:24,391 --> 00:38:27,178
NO ONE FINISHES DOING COCAINE
WITH A HOOKER

872
00:38:27,178 --> 00:38:30,081
AND IS LIKE, CAN I
GET A RECEIPT?

873
00:38:30,081 --> 00:38:32,225
>> SPEAK FOR YOURSELF.

874
00:38:32,225 --> 00:38:38,736
IF CONVICTED, HE COULD BE
SENTENCED TO UP TO 17 YEARS IN PRISON,

875
00:38:38,736 --> 00:38:43,957
WHICH WOULD BE THE FIRST
TIME ANY BIDEN HAS SUCCESSFULLY
COMPLETED A SENTENCE.

876
00:38:47,149 --> 00:38:53,170
HOUSE SPEAKER MIKE JOHNSON SAID
THAT HE IS BLURRING THE FACES ON
THE FOOTAGE OF JANUARY 6th RIOTERS

877
00:38:53,170 --> 00:38:55,840
SO THAT NONE OF THEM
WOULD BE CHARGED WITH A CRIME.

878
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:59,704
UNFORTUNATELY, WE'LL NEVER KNOW
WHO THEY ARE.

879
00:39:03,016 --> 00:39:04,696
>> THAT'S PHOTO SHOPPED.

880
00:39:04,696 --> 00:39:09,590
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNIVERSITY
OF PENNSYLVANIA HAS RESIGNED

881
00:39:09,590 --> 00:39:12,299
AFTER APPEARING TO DODGE
QUESTIONS ABOUT GENOCIDE

882
00:39:12,299 --> 00:39:15,626
DURING
A CONGRESSIONAL HEARING ON
CAMPUS ANTI-SEMITISM.

883
00:39:15,626 --> 00:39:18,131
SHE WILL BE REPLACED BY
LITERALLY ANYONE

884
00:39:18,131 --> 00:39:21,128
WHO KNOWS YOU
SAY GENOCIDE IS BAD.

885
00:39:21,128 --> 00:39:25,083
THE WHOLE CRAZY PART IS THAT THE
WHOLE POINT DURING HER SPEECH

886
00:39:25,083 --> 00:39:28,299
WAS THAT FREE SPEECH ON CAMPUS
SHOULD NEVER BE PUNISHED,

887
00:39:28,299 --> 00:39:31,975
AND
SHE WAS IMMEDIATELY PUNISHED FOR
HER SPEECH.

888
00:39:31,975 --> 00:39:36,097
VICTOR MANUAL ROCCA

889
00:39:36,097 --> 00:39:39,881
HAS BEEN CHARGED WITH SPYING FOR CUBA SINCE 1981,

890
00:39:39,881 --> 00:39:45,047
AND THAT'S WHY CUBA
IS THE UNSTOPPABLE SUPERPOWER
THEY ARE TODAY.

891
00:39:46,930 --> 00:39:50,568
>> A NEW POLL FINDS THAT NEW
YORK MAYOR ERIC ADAMS'

892
00:39:50,568 --> 00:39:53,172
APPROVAL
RATING IS JUST 28%.

893
00:39:53,172 --> 00:39:55,144
NOW, THAT SOUNDS LOW.

894
00:39:55,144 --> 00:39:58,198
INDEPENDENT PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE

895
00:39:58,198 --> 00:40:01,155
ROBERT F. KENNEDY ADMITTED

896
00:40:01,155 --> 00:40:04,545
HE FLEW TWO TIMES TO
JEFFREY EPSTEIN'S ON HIS PRIVATE JET,

897
00:40:04,545 --> 00:40:08,328
BUT ON TO MAKE SURE NONE OF
THEM WERE VACCINATED.

898
00:40:11,956 --> 00:40:15,336
GOOD

899
00:40:15,336 --> 00:40:20,660
>> MITCH McCONNELL, SEEN HERE
BRINGING PEANUTS INTO A PRESCHOOL CAFETERIA,

900
00:40:23,603 --> 00:40:26,508
SAID HE
WILL TELL REPUBLICAN SENATORS

901
00:40:26,508 --> 00:40:29,505
TO VOTE AGAINST ADDITIONAL AID FOR
UKRAINE AND ISRAEL

902
00:40:29,505 --> 00:40:31,925
UNTIL THERE ARE MEDIATE
CHANGES TO THE BORDER.

903
00:40:31,925 --> 00:40:36,381
BUT THE WAY IT CAME OUT WERE
BRAINS.

904
00:40:38,961 --> 00:40:44,140
ON HIS WEBSITE, TRUTH SOCIAL
DOT -- I'M GOING TO GUESS SCAM --

905
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:49,834
DONALD TRUMP DENIED
REPORTS HE WAS SO DEPRESSED
AFTER THE 2020 ELECTION THAT HE STOPPED EATING

906
00:40:49,834 --> 00:40:54,200
SAYING, QUOTE, IT
WAS NOT THAT I WAS NOT EATING.
IT WAS THAT I WAS EATING TOO
MUCH.

907
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:57,104
WOW, GOOD SAVE.

908
00:40:57,354 --> 00:41:00,880
THAT'S LIKE WHEN A RUMOR WENT
AROUND MIDDLE SCHOOL THAT I PEED MY PANTS

909
00:41:00,961 --> 00:41:04,754
AND I WAS LIKE JOKE'S
ON YOU BECAUSE I ACTUALLY POOPED
THEM.

910
00:41:05,247 --> 00:41:10,159
>> THE DODGERS HAVE SIGNED
SHOHEI OHTANI

911
00:41:10,159 --> 00:41:13,613
TO A TEN-YEAR
CONTRACT WORTH $700 MILLION,

912
00:41:13,613 --> 00:41:18,480
WHICH IS ALMOST AS MUCH AS HIS
SISTER ON ONLYFANS, SHOW FEET
OHTANI.

913
00:41:22,014 --> 00:41:24,971
I THOUGHT THAT WAS A REAL SMART JOKE

914
00:41:24,971 --> 00:41:29,609
McDONALD'S HAS ANNOUNCED
A NEW SPINOFF RESTAURANT CALLED
COSMCS.

915
00:41:29,609 --> 00:41:33,427
REGULAR, BUT
THE MASCOT IS --

916
00:41:33,427 --> 00:41:36,338
OH, NO, COSBY
McDONALD?

917
00:41:40,118 --> 00:41:43,683
>> ACCORDING TO A NEW STUDY, THE
RATE OF DEPRESSION

918
00:41:43,683 --> 00:41:46,261
AMONG MEN IN
AMERICA IS AT AN ALL-TIME HIGH.

919
00:41:46,261 --> 00:41:49,954
HERE TO COMMENT IS OUR VERY OWN
MARCELLO HERNANDEZ.

920
00:41:52,698 --> 00:41:56,397
>> COLIN, GREAT TO SEE YOU.
YOU LOOKING GOOD, COLIN.

921
00:41:56,397 --> 00:41:58,658
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
IT'S ALWAYS GREAT TO SEE YOU.

922
00:41:58,658 --> 00:42:00,855
WHY DO YOU THINK MEN ARE
DEPRESSED?

923
00:42:00,855 --> 00:42:04,074
>> COLIN, TO UNDERSTAND WHY MEN
ARE DEPRESSED,

924
00:42:04,074 --> 00:42:06,068
WE HAVE TO FIRST
TALK ABOUT WOMEN,

925
00:42:06,068 --> 00:42:09,639
AND I
UNDERSTAND WOMEN.

926
00:42:09,639 --> 00:42:13,028
>> I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WANT TO
START WITH THAT, BUT --

927
00:42:13,028 --> 00:42:16,588
>> NO, COLIN.
I GREW UP WITH ONLY WOMEN IN MY
HOUSE.

928
00:42:16,588 --> 00:42:18,660
IT WAS ME, MY MOM, AND MY
SISTER.

929
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:21,846
IN HIGH SCHOOL, MY MOM'S BEST
FRIEND AND HER DAUGHTER MOVED IN,

930
00:42:21,846 --> 00:42:23,866
SO IT WAS JUST ME AND FOUR
WOMEN.

931
00:42:23,866 --> 00:42:27,938
AND WHEN THAT HAPPENS TO YOU,
COLIN, WHEN IT'S JUST YOU AND FOUR WOMEN,

932
00:42:27,938 --> 00:42:29,437
YOU HAVE NO
CHOICE --

933
00:42:29,437 --> 00:42:30,990
>> BUT TO BECOME THE MAN OF THE
HOUSE?

934
00:42:30,990 --> 00:42:33,858
>> WRONG.
TO BECOME A WOMAN.

935
00:42:33,858 --> 00:42:36,327
I WAS A WOMAN FOR MANY YEARS,
COLIN.

936
00:42:36,327 --> 00:42:39,447
A PROUD LATINA WOMAN.

937
00:42:40,186 --> 00:42:42,073
I WAS LIVING A DOUBLE LIFE.

938
00:42:42,073 --> 00:42:44,567
AT SCHOOL, I WAS CAPTAIN OF THE
SOCCER TEAM

939
00:42:44,567 --> 00:42:47,859
 YELLING YOU BETTER
PLAY DEFENSE TODAY.

940
00:42:47,859 --> 00:42:51,813
AND AT HOME, MY MOM WOULD BE
LIKE, HOW DO I LOOK.

941
00:42:51,813 --> 00:42:55,313
AND I WOULD BE LIKE, YOU LOOK
AMAZING MOMMY.

942
00:42:55,313 --> 00:43:00,653
GO INTO YOUR ROOM AND WALK OUT
AGAIN.
I WANT TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

943
00:43:00,653 --> 00:43:02,985
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
THE WHITE HOUSE?

944
00:43:02,985 --> 00:43:06,177
IS MY MOM GOING TO MEET THE
PRESIDENT?

945
00:43:06,177 --> 00:43:09,328
>> AND HOW DOES THIS RELATE TO
MEN BEING DEPRESSED?

946
00:43:09,328 --> 00:43:12,733
>> BECAUSE, WOMEN SUPPORT EACH
OTHER.

947
00:43:12,733 --> 00:43:16,011
MEN DON'T SUPPORT EACH OTHER.
THAT'S WHY THEY'RE DEPRESSED.

948
00:43:16,011 --> 00:43:20,750
A GIRL CAN TELL HER FRIEND
ANYTHING, AND SHE'LL SUPPORT IT
NO MATTER WHAT.

949
00:43:20,750 --> 00:43:24,923
SHE'LL BE LIKE, I'M DATING THIS
GUY, 

950
00:43:24,923 --> 00:43:27,962
AND HE ROBS BANKS.

951
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:34,901
AND THEN HER FRIEND WILL BE
LIKE, AT LEAST HE HAS A PASSION.

952
00:43:38,225 --> 00:43:41,067
>> AND YOU DON'T THINK THAT MEN
ARE AS SUPPORTIVE?

953
00:43:41,067 --> 00:43:44,939
>> NO, NOT AT ALL.
THAT'S WHY I DON'T GO TO THE
BARBERSHOP ANYMORE, COLIN.

954
00:43:44,939 --> 00:43:49,114
IT'S A NEGATIVE ENERGY IN THERE.
NO ONE IS HAPPY TO SEE YOU.

955
00:43:49,114 --> 00:43:52,972
EVERY TIME I GO, THE GUY'S LIKE,
LOOK WHO IT IS.

956
00:43:52,972 --> 00:43:57,206
WE ALREADY TOLD YOU, BUDDY, WE
CAN'T MAKE YOU TALLER.

957
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:04,509
THAT'S WHY A LITTLE PRINCE LIKE
ME GOES TO THE SALON, COLIN.

958
00:44:05,507 --> 00:44:08,783
I GET TO THE SALON, COLIN, AND
THE LADY IS LIKE, 

959
00:44:08,783 --> 00:44:12,024
WHERE HAVE YOU
BEEN?

960
00:44:12,024 --> 00:44:16,374
AND I'M LIKE, I DON'T KNOW.

961
00:44:16,374 --> 00:44:19,239
I MISSED YOU.

962
00:44:21,411 --> 00:44:25,852
>> OKAY.
THE SALON DO BE SOUNDING KIND OF
FIRE.

963
00:44:26,586 --> 00:44:32,060
>> IT DO, IT DO, COLIN, IT DO!

964
00:44:32,060 --> 00:44:35,958
I'M JUST TRYING TO SAY THAT
WOMEN HAVE SUPPORT, OKAY.

965
00:44:35,958 --> 00:44:39,502
WHEN A WOMAN GOES THROUGH A
BREAKUP, ALL HER FRIENDS SHOW
UP.

966
00:44:39,502 --> 00:44:41,379
WHEN A GUY GOES THROUGH A BREAKUP,

967
00:44:41,379 --> 00:44:45,293
 HIS BOYS JUST ACT LIKE
HIS FLIGHT GOT DELAYED.

968
00:44:45,293 --> 00:44:49,599
YOU'LL BE LIKE, YO, I WAS IN
LOVE WITH HER MAN, AND OUT OF
NOWHERE, SHE LEFT ME.

969
00:44:49,599 --> 00:44:51,771
AND MY BEST FRIEND WILL BE LIKE,

970
00:44:51,771 --> 00:44:56,140
DAMN.
