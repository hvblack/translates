UNIVERSITY PRESIDENTS

00:00:32,429 --> 00:00:35,299
>> CAN I JUST RESIGN NOW?

11
00:00:35,299 --> 00:00:36,556
>> NOT YET.

12
00:00:36,556 --> 00:00:39,901
AND THE PRESIDENT OF HARVARD,
DR. CLAUDINE GAY.

13
00:00:39,901 --> 00:00:41,119
>> THANK YOU.

14
00:00:41,119 --> 00:00:45,380
>> DR. GAY, WOULD YOU LIKE TO DO
A QUICK JOKE ABOUT YOUR NAME TO
GET IT OUT OF THE WAY?

15
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:51,090
>> I WOULD.
DR. GAY SOUNDS LIKE A MOLLY
TEALER ON FIRE ISLAND.

16
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:52,314
>> THANK YOU.

17
00:00:52,314 --> 00:00:57,029
NOW, I'LL TURN IT OVER TO MEG
SUPERSTAR ELISE STEFANIK FROM NEW YORK

18
00:00:57,029 --> 00:01:01,134
WHO'S BEEN PACING THE
HALLWAYS LISTENING TO LOSE
YOURSELF BY EMINEM.

19
00:01:01,134 --> 00:01:02,750
MS. STEFANIK.

20
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:04,851
>> THANK YOU, CHAIRWOMAN.

21
00:01:04,851 --> 00:01:09,469
I'M GOING TO START SCREAMING
QUESTIONS AT THESE WOMEN LIKE
I'M BILLY EICHNER.

22
00:01:09,469 --> 00:01:12,643
ANTI-SEMITISM, YEA OR NAY.

23
00:01:12,643 --> 00:01:14,393
>> I'M SORRY.
WHAT?

24
00:01:14,393 --> 00:01:17,537
>> YES OR NO, IS CALLING FOR JEWS

25
00:01:17,537 --> 00:01:20,343
AGAINST THE CODE OF CONDUCT
FOR HARVARD?

26
00:01:20,343 --> 00:01:23,026
>> WELL, IT DEPENDS ON THE
CONTEXT.

27
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:25,738
>> THAT CAN'T BE THE ANSWER.

28
00:01:25,738 --> 00:01:28,678
UPENN LADY, YES OR NO?

29
00:01:28,782 --> 00:01:32,545
>> WE ARE INTERESTED IN STOPPING
ALL FORMS OF HATRED,

30
00:01:32,545 --> 00:01:35,769
ANTI-SEMITISM, ISLAM PHOBIA.

31
00:01:36,353 --> 00:01:39,781
SECOND
CHANGE

32
00:01:39,781 --> 00:01:43,794
KEEP IN MIND:
IF YOU DON'T SAY YES, YOU'RE
GOING TO MAKE ME LOOK GOOD,

33
00:01:43,794 --> 00:01:46,439
WHICH IS REALLY HARD TO DO.

34
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:50,864
SO I'LL ASK YOU STRAIGHT UP.
DO YOU THINK GENOCIDE IS BAD?

35
00:01:50,864 --> 00:01:56,480
>> COULD I SUBMIT AN ANSWER IN
WRITING AT A LATER DATE?

36
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:59,837
>> AM I WINNING THIS HEARING?

37
00:01:59,837 --> 00:02:01,871
SOMEBODY PINCH ME.

38
00:02:01,871 --> 00:02:06,104
>> MS. STEFANIK, YOUR TIME IS
UP.
>> OH, THANK GOD.

39
00:02:06,104 --> 00:02:10,151
>> THE CHAIR RECOGNIZES
GENTLEMAN FROM MICHIGAN.

40
00:02:10,151 --> 00:02:12,380
>> THANK YOU.

41
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:16,939
I YIELD MY TIME BACK TO
MS. STEFANIK.
>> DAMN IT.

42
00:02:16,939 --> 00:02:22,348
>> I AM HERE TODAY BECAUSE HATE
SPEECH HAS NO PLACE ON COLLEGE
CAMPUSES.

43
00:02:22,436 --> 00:02:25,683
HATE SPEECH BELONGS IN CONGRESS,

44
00:02:25,683 --> 00:02:28,024
ON ELON MUSK'S TWITTER,

45
00:02:28,024 --> 00:02:30,962
IN PRIVATE DINNER WITH MY DONORS

46
00:02:30,962 --> 00:02:35,505
AND IN PUBLIC SPEECHES MY BY
WORK HUSBAND, DONALD TRUMP.

47
00:02:35,505 --> 00:02:39,594
SO DR. GAY, SIMPLE QUESTION,

48
00:02:39,594 --> 00:02:43,816
IS IT ACCEPTABLE FOR STUDENTS TO
USE ANTI-SEMITIC LANGUAGE?

49
00:02:43,816 --> 00:02:49,443
>> ON THIS SUBJECT, I WOULD LIKE
TO SPEAK NOT FROM THE HEART BUT
FROM THE THESAURUS.

50
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:53,899
THAT TYPE OF HATEFUL SPEECH IS
PERSONALLY ABHORRENT TO ME.

51
00:02:53,899 --> 00:02:57,890
>> COULD YOU PHRASE THAT IN AN
EVEN MORE ACADEMIC WAY?

52
00:02:57,890 --> 00:03:01,587
>> SURE.
THAT VARIETY OF ODIOUS

53
00:03:01,587 --> 00:03:04,867
IS
SLOW
RATION IS REPUGNANT.

54
00:03:04,868 --> 00:03:10,452
PROTECT

55
00:03:10,452 --> 00:03:13,941
WE'RE TALKING PRECAUTIONS TO
PROTECT ALL STUDENTS,

56
00:03:13,941 --> 00:03:17,226
JEWISH
STUDENTS, MUSLIM STUDENTS.

57
00:03:18,223 --> 00:03:22,218
>> AGAIN, UGH, JUST THE FIRST
ONE.

58
00:03:22,218 --> 00:03:27,791
THIS IS PERSONAL FOR ME.
WHILE I AM NOT JEWISH, I'M ROMAN CATHOLIC,

59
00:03:27,864 --> 00:03:32,819
SOME OF MY CLOSEST
FRIENDS ARE ALSO ROMAN CATHOLIC.

60
00:03:32,819 --> 00:03:36,325
SO UPENN LADY, WOULD YOU SAY
THAT YOU ARE

61
00:03:36,325 --> 00:03:41,263
ANTI, ANTI, ANTI, ANTI
ANTI-SEMITIC?

62
00:03:41,263 --> 00:03:45,218
>> I'M SORRY.
CAN YOU TELL ME HOW MANY ANTIS
THAT WAS?

63
00:03:45,285 --> 00:03:47,579
>> I WILL NOT.

64
00:03:47,579 --> 00:03:50,673
>> YOU'RE ASKING US QUESTIONS
THAT SEEM VERY UNFAIR.

65
00:03:50,673 --> 00:03:53,863
>> OH.
THANK YOU.

66
00:03:53,863 --> 00:03:58,099
>> THE CHAIR RECOGNIZES
MR. TAKANO FROM CALIFORNIA.

67
00:03:58,099 --> 00:03:59,863
>> THANK YOU, CHAIRWOMAN.

68
00:03:59,863 --> 00:04:05,441
SO TO CLEAR THINGS UP, WHAT DOES
VIOLATE THE CODE OF CONDUCT AT
YOUR SCHOOLS?

69
00:04:05,441 --> 00:04:10,283
WHAT ABOUT IF SOMEONE ON CAMPUS
YELLED, I POISONED THE WATER
SUPPLY?

70
00:04:10,283 --> 00:04:14,842
>> IF THEY POISONED IT WITH
DIVERSITY, THAT COULD BE
WONDERFUL.

71
00:04:14,842 --> 00:04:19,289
>> MM, DIVERSE WATER, IT SOUNDS
DELICIOUS.

72
00:04:19,289 --> 00:04:22,942
>> OKAY.
AND WHAT IF THEY YELLED, I'VE
GOT A KNIFE?

73
00:04:22,942 --> 00:04:26,337
>> WELL, MAYBE THEY HAVE A LISP,
AND THEY'RE SAYING,

74
00:04:26,337 --> 00:04:29,902
I HAVE A
KNIFE BOUQUET OF FLOWERS FOR
YOU.

75
00:04:29,902 --> 00:04:33,594
>> AS LONG AS THE FLOWERS ARE
DIVERSE, I ACCEPT.

76
00:04:33,594 --> 00:04:38,327
>> AND WHAT IF THEY YELLED FIRE
IN A CROWDED THEATER?

77
00:04:38,327 --> 00:04:43,451
>> I WOULD BE EXCITED THE
THEATER WAS CROWDED BECAUSE I
SUPPORT THE ARTS.

78
00:04:43,451 --> 00:04:48,926
>> OH, MY GOD.
CAN YOU TAKE A MORAL STANCE ON
ANYTHING?

79
00:04:48,926 --> 00:04:53,344
CAN ANYONE HERE SAY YES TO A
SINGLE QUESTION?

80
00:04:53,344 --> 00:04:55,636
>> YES, HELLO.

81
00:04:55,636 --> 00:05:00,086
I AM THE PRESIDENT OF THE
UNIVERSITY OF PHOENIX ONLINE.

82
00:05:00,387 --> 00:05:04,843
AND I AM WILLING TO SAY YES TO
ANYTHING.

83
00:05:05,386 --> 00:05:08,673
>> SEE?
SEE, FINALLY,

84
00:05:08,673 --> 00:05:12,128
A REAL PRESIDENT
OF A REAL UNIVERSITY.

85
00:05:12,128 --> 00:05:14,908
>> THAT'S ACTUALLY OUR SCHOOL
MOTTO.

86
00:05:14,908 --> 00:05:19,124
U OF P, WE ARE A REAL
UNIVERSITY.

87
00:05:19,124 --> 00:05:24,245
>> AND WILL YOU PROMISE TO
ELIMINATE ALL ANTI-SEMITISM FROM
YOUR CAMPUS?

88
00:05:24,245 --> 00:05:28,478
>> WELL, MY CAMPUS IS THE INTERNET,

89
00:05:28,478 --> 00:05:35,251
SO ANTI-SEMITISM IS
KIND OF OUR MOST POPULAR MAJOR.

90
00:05:35,251 --> 00:05:38,454
AND OUR MASCOT IS PORN.

91
00:05:38,454 --> 00:05:41,760
>> OKAY.
THEN WILL YOU OFFER A COURSE

92
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:44,668
EXPLAINING WHY ANTI-SEMITISM IS
WRONG?

93
00:05:44,668 --> 00:05:48,112
>> LADY, WE'LL OFFER A COURSE ON
ANYTHING.

94
00:05:48,112 --> 00:05:51,211
OUR ONLY MANDATORY COURSES ARE

95
00:05:51,211 --> 00:05:54,338
HOW TO LOG INTO THE UNIVERSITY OF PHOENIX ONLINE

96
00:05:54,338 --> 00:05:57,089
AND HOW TO SET
UP AUTOPAY.

97
00:05:57,089 --> 00:05:58,688
>> THANK YOU.

98
00:05:58,688 --> 00:06:02,550
SOMEHOW THAT WAS THE ONLY
STRAIGHT ANSWER I GOT ALL DAY.

99
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:05,537
>> WELL, PLEASE DON'T SAY THE
ANSWER WAS STRAIGHT.

100
00:06:05,537 --> 00:06:09,649
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THE ANSWER'S
SEXUAL ORIENTATION IS.

101
00:06:09,649 --> 00:06:12,402
>> THANK YOU.
THAT'S ALL THE TIME WE HAVE.

102
00:06:12,402 --> 00:06:15,635
THIS WAS ALL VERY USELESS.

103
00:06:15,635 --> 00:06:20,445
>> NOT FOR ME.
FOR ME, IT WAS VERY USEFUL.

104
00:06:20,445 --> 00:06:24,538
I HAD A GREAT TIME.
I'M THE HANUKKAH GIFT NO ONE
WANTED.

105
00:06:24,538 --> 00:06:28,868
AND LIVE FROM NEW YORK, IT'S
SATURDAY NIGHT!

106
00:08:34,663 --> 00:08:39,715
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, ADAM
DRIVER!

107
00:08:54,251 --> 00:08:56,974
>>> HELLO.

108
00:08:58,225 --> 00:09:01,426
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

109
00:09:01,426 --> 00:09:03,880
I'M SO EXCITED TO BE BACK!

110
00:09:04,584 --> 00:09:08,312
ESPECIALLY DURING THIS TIME OF
YEAR.

111
00:09:08,312 --> 00:09:11,268
I LOVE CHRISTMAS.
IT'S MY FAVORITE HOLIDAY.

112
00:09:11,268 --> 00:09:13,884
THE FOOD, THE MUSIC, THE FAMILY.

113
00:09:13,884 --> 00:09:17,102
BUT LARGELY, IT'S BECAUSE I HAVE
A VERY DEEP

114
00:09:17,102 --> 00:09:19,833
AND PERSONAL
RELATIONSHIP WITH SANTA.

115
00:09:19,833 --> 00:09:23,740
AND EVERY YEAR, I MAKE MY
CHRISTMAS LIST AND I TELL IT TO
HIM.

116
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:26,740
IT'S KIND OF OUR RITUAL.
USUALLY I DO IT IN PRIVATE,

117
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:30,129
BUT
SINCE WE'RE HERE AND I KNOW
SANTA WATCHES SNL.

118
00:09:30,129 --> 00:09:33,784
HE HASN'T LIKED IT SINCE KATTAN
LEFT.

119
00:09:33,784 --> 00:09:35,589
BUT IF YOU DON'T MIND,

120
00:09:35,589 --> 00:09:40,366
I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE MY CHRISTMAS LIST
RIGHT NOW IF THAT'S OKAY.

121
00:09:43,417 --> 00:09:44,578
I'LL TAKE THAT.

122
00:09:44,578 --> 00:09:47,906
THE PIANO IS PART OF THE RITUAL.
HE LOVES HEARING ME PLAY,

123
00:09:47,906 --> 00:09:52,057
AND
IT'S ACTUALLY ME PLAYING.
CAN WE GET A CLOSEUP OF MY
HANDS?

124
00:09:52,057 --> 00:09:55,857
SEE, THEY'RE VERY BIG.
VERY BIG HANDS.

125
00:10:04,581 --> 00:10:07,522
I MEAN, THAT'S PRETTY GOOD, HUH?

126
00:10:09,492 --> 00:10:10,850
OKAY.
THANK YOU.

127
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:13,679
IF YOU DON'T MIND, I WOULD LIKE
TO TALK TO SANTA NOW.

128
00:10:19,726 --> 00:10:22,215
HEY, SANTA!

129
00:10:22,356 --> 00:10:24,424
OH, RIGHT.
WE'RE ON TV.

130
00:10:24,424 --> 00:10:26,751
HEY, SANTA.

131
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:30,668
IT'S ME, ADAM.
DRIVER.

132
00:10:30,641 --> 00:10:33,131
FROM THE NICE LIST.

133
00:10:33,131 --> 00:10:36,163
AND ALSO GIRLS.

134
00:10:36,688 --> 00:10:39,164
I TURN 40 THIS YEAR, SANTA.

135
00:10:39,164 --> 00:10:42,269
SO I WOULD LIKE FIVE PAIRS OF
CHINOS.

136
00:10:42,269 --> 00:10:46,786
I ALSO WANT ONE OF THOSE GIANT
METAL TESLA TRUCKS.

137
00:10:46,786 --> 00:10:51,257
I THINK IT WOULD PAIR PERFECTLY
WITH MY TEENY TINY MICRO PENIS.

138
00:10:52,154 --> 00:10:57,419
OH, AND I WOULD LIKE PEOPLE TO
STOP COMING UP TO ME ON THE
STREET SAYING YOU KILLED HAN
SOLO.

139
00:10:57,419 --> 00:11:01,732
I DIDN'T KILL HIM, WOKENESS
KILLED HAN SOLO.

140
00:11:01,732 --> 00:11:04,901
LET'S SEE.
WHAT ELSE DO I WANT?

141
00:11:04,982 --> 00:11:10,125
OH, YOU KNOW THOSE TIKTOKS
THAT'S LIKE THOSE COUPLES THAT
DO PRANKS ON EACH OTHER?

142
00:11:10,125 --> 00:11:12,624
CAN YOU KILL THOSE PEOPLE?

143
00:11:14,003 --> 00:11:16,957
I KNOW.
I KNOW.

144
00:11:16,957 --> 00:11:22,409
OKAY.
NOW IT'S PART OF THE RITUAL
WHERE I PLAY OH HOLY NIGHT 

145
00:11:22,409 --> 00:11:26,083
WHERE MAKING UNBREAKABLE EYE CONTACT
WITH THE CAMERA.

146
00:11:33,752 --> 00:11:37,006
ACTUALLY, THAT'S REALLY HARD.
I'M NOT GOING TO DO THAT
ANYMORE.

147
00:11:39,588 --> 00:11:42,850
OH, YOU KNOW WHAT I WANT FOR CHRISTMAS

148
00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:45,069
 IS A GINGER BREAD
HOUSE.

149
00:11:45,069 --> 00:11:47,593
DO YOU THINK A GINGER BREAD MAN
GETS SCARED 

150
00:11:47,593 --> 00:11:51,245
WHEN HE REALIZES THE
HOUSE IS MADE OF HIS OWN SKIN?

151
00:11:51,245 --> 00:11:54,224
THAT'S A CUTE ONE.
YOU CAN TELL YOUR KIDS THAT ONE.

152
00:11:54,224 --> 00:11:59,024
I SHOULD ALSO SAY ANOTHER THING
I LOVE ABOUT CHRISTMAS IS
EGGNOG.

153
00:11:59,024 --> 00:12:00,964
IT'S MY FAVORITE WAY TO HAVE
EGG.

154
00:12:00,964 --> 00:12:05,509
WHENEVER I GO TO A DINER AND
THEY SAY HOW WOULD YOU LIKE YOUR
EGGS, I SAY NOGGED.

155
00:12:05,786 --> 00:12:08,928
OKAY, SANTA.
THANK YOU FOR LISTENING.

156
00:12:08,928 --> 00:12:12,957
I LOOK FORWARD TO YOU BREAKING
INTO MY HOUSE.

157
00:12:12,957 --> 00:12:15,585
I TOTALLY FORGOT.

158
00:12:15,585 --> 00:12:17,457
I GOT YOU A GIFT THIS YEAR.

159
00:12:17,457 --> 00:12:21,427
IT'S MY NEW MOVIE "FERRARI"
WHICH OPENS CHRISTMAS DAY.

160
00:12:21,427 --> 00:12:25,148
YOU'RE WELCOME.
MERRY CHRISTMAS, SANTA.
BIG FINISH.

161
00:12:29,664 --> 00:12:31,892
IT'S ALMOST DONE.

162
00:12:36,514 --> 00:12:39,010
MERRY CHRISTMAS, SANTA!

163
00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:43,749
WE GOT A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU
TONIGHT.
OLIVIA RODRIGO I HERE!

164
00:12:43,749 --> 00:12:47,101

165
00:12:58,826 --> 00:13:03,763
IS.

166
00:13:03,765 --> 00:13:04,264
>> YEAH.

167
00:13:04,266 --> 00:13:06,533
WE GOT TO DO THESE ADULT ONLY

168
00:13:06,535 --> 00:13:07,467
SKI TRIPS MORE OFTEN.

169
00:13:07,469 --> 00:13:09,502
>> NOT GOING TO CHECK MY PHONE.

170
00:13:09,504 --> 00:13:11,504
SHE'S WITH THE SITTER.

171
00:13:11,506 --> 00:13:11,905
SHE'S FINE.

172
00:13:11,907 --> 00:13:13,239
>> HONEY, HOW ARE YOU GOING TO

173
00:13:13,241 --> 00:13:15,041
COPE WHEN THERE'S TWO OF THEM?

174
00:13:15,043 --> 00:13:18,311
>> OH, MY GOD.

175
00:13:18,313 --> 00:13:20,079
ARE YOU PREGNANT AGAIN?

176
00:13:20,081 --> 00:13:21,948
>> WE'RE NOT PREGNANT YET, BUT

177
00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:23,349
WE'RE TRYING FOR ANOTHER ONE.

178
00:13:23,351 --> 00:13:25,251
>> THAT'S SO GREAT, GUYS.

179
00:13:25,253 --> 00:13:26,085
>> YEAH.

180
00:13:26,087 --> 00:13:27,720
DON'T COME NOTHING ON OUR DOOR

181
00:13:27,722 --> 00:13:28,087
TONIGHT.

182
00:13:28,089 --> 00:13:30,223
>> AWW.

183
00:13:30,225 --> 00:13:32,225
>> DANIEL, SINCE WE'RE ON THE

184
00:13:32,227 --> 00:13:33,393
TOPIC, SHOULD WE TELL THEM?

185
00:13:33,395 --> 00:13:35,361
>> OH, WELL, WE WEREN'T GOING TO

186
00:13:35,363 --> 00:13:37,664
SAY IT, BUT LET'S JUST TELL

187
00:13:37,666 --> 00:13:37,964
THEM.

188
00:13:37,966 --> 00:13:41,000
>> WE'RE TRYING TO HAVE A BABY

189
00:13:41,002 --> 00:13:41,301
TOO.

190
00:13:41,303 --> 00:13:42,202
>> OH, THAT'S GREAT.

191
00:13:42,204 --> 00:13:43,102
>> SO EXCITING.

192
00:13:43,104 --> 00:13:46,005
>> I'M SO, SO HAPPY FOR YOU.

193
00:13:46,007 --> 00:13:47,040
SO TELL ALL NOW.

194
00:13:47,042 --> 00:13:48,408
WHAT'S YOUR PLAN?

195
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:50,677
ARE YOU GOING TO ADOPT?

196
00:13:50,679 --> 00:13:52,212
>> NO.

197
00:13:52,214 --> 00:13:53,680
WE'RE JUST GONNA TRY.

198
00:13:53,682 --> 00:13:55,782
>> SO THEN YOU'RE DOING THE

199
00:13:55,784 --> 00:13:56,950
SURROGATE ROUTE.

200
00:13:56,952 --> 00:13:57,417
THAT'S GREAT.

201
00:13:57,419 --> 00:14:00,286
>> HUH, SURROGACY, WELL, MAYBE

202
00:14:00,288 --> 00:14:02,755
DOWN THE LINE, BUT FOR NOW,

203
00:14:02,757 --> 00:14:05,692
WE'RE JUST GONNA TRY.

204
00:14:05,694 --> 00:14:08,027
>> SO DON'T COME KNOCKING ON OUR

205
00:14:08,029 --> 00:14:08,428
DOOR EITHER.

206
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:11,364
>> AWW.

207
00:14:11,366 --> 00:14:12,966
>> SO ARE YOU TWO JUST STRAIGHT

208
00:14:12,968 --> 00:14:13,933
UP HAVING SEX?

209
00:14:13,935 --> 00:14:17,737
>> I MEAN, WE'RE NOT JUST HAVING

210
00:14:17,739 --> 00:14:18,004
SEX.

211
00:14:18,006 --> 00:14:18,805
WE'RE GETTING A LITTLE HELP.

212
00:14:18,807 --> 00:14:21,774
AFTER JACOB IS DONE, I'M

213
00:14:21,776 --> 00:14:23,209
THROWING MY LEGS UP, HANGING OFF

214
00:14:23,211 --> 00:14:25,278
THE BAR AND LETTING GRAVITY DO

215
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:25,678
ITS THING.

216
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,847
>> NOBODY ASK ME TO GO INTO THE

217
00:14:27,849 --> 00:14:29,616
HOT TUB TONIGHT, I'M NOT BOILING

218
00:14:29,618 --> 00:14:30,316
MY BALLS.

219
00:14:30,318 --> 00:14:30,950
>> RIGHT.

220
00:14:30,952 --> 00:14:32,852
SO HOW IS THE TRYING GOING?

221
00:14:32,854 --> 00:14:33,419
>> GOOD.

222
00:14:33,421 --> 00:14:33,886
GOOD.

223
00:14:33,888 --> 00:14:35,188
I THINK WE'RE GETTING REALLY

224
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:35,521
CLOSE.

225
00:14:35,523 --> 00:14:37,290
>> YEAH, YEAH, MY BODY IS

226
00:14:37,292 --> 00:14:38,424
ALREADY CHANGING.

227
00:14:38,426 --> 00:14:40,927
THIS COULD BE IN MY HEAD, BUT I

228
00:14:40,929 --> 00:14:42,428
JUST NEED CERTAIN FOODS.

229
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:44,797
WHEN YOU WERE PREGNANT, WERE YOU

230
00:14:44,799 --> 00:14:47,767
RANDOMLY CRAVING HAM AND

231
00:14:47,769 --> 00:14:48,101
COCAINE?

232
00:14:48,103 --> 00:14:48,735
>> NO.

233
00:14:48,737 --> 00:14:50,403
BUT THAT DOES BRING UP MORE

234
00:14:50,405 --> 00:14:50,937
QUESTIONS FOR ME.

235
00:14:50,939 --> 00:14:52,138
>> OKAY.

236
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:52,438
FINE.

237
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,072
LADY, WE KNOW.

238
00:14:53,074 --> 00:14:54,574
THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM.

239
00:14:54,576 --> 00:14:55,842
>> WHOO, OKAY.

240
00:14:55,844 --> 00:14:57,610
WE THOUGHT YOU WEREN'T GOING TO

241
00:14:57,612 --> 00:14:58,011
MENTION IT.

242
00:14:58,013 --> 00:15:00,813
>> DANIEL IS 34, SO THE

243
00:15:00,815 --> 00:15:05,318
PREGNANCY WOULD TECHNICALLY BE A

244
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:05,718
GERIATRIC.

245
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,453
>> I GUESS THE PREGNANCY PART IS

246
00:15:07,455 --> 00:15:08,588
WHAT'S CONFUSING.

247
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:09,856
>> LET ME EXPLAIN.

248
00:15:09,858 --> 00:15:13,059
FOR NOW, FOR US, IT'S ABOUT WHAT

249
00:15:13,061 --> 00:15:14,294
FEELS GOOD FOR US.

250
00:15:14,296 --> 00:15:16,496
AND FOR NOW, FOR US, WHAT FEELS

251
00:15:16,498 --> 00:15:19,399
GOOD FOR US IS FOR US TO TRY.

252
00:15:19,401 --> 00:15:21,267
>> BECAUSE FOR US, FOR NOW, WHAT

253
00:15:21,269 --> 00:15:22,969
FEELS GOOD FOR NOW IS TRYING,

254
00:15:22,971 --> 00:15:23,436
FOR US.

255
00:15:23,438 --> 00:15:24,904
>> FOR NOW.

256
00:15:24,906 --> 00:15:26,306
>> GOT IT.

257
00:15:26,308 --> 00:15:27,907
SO WHY DID YOU GUYS DECIDE TO

258
00:15:27,909 --> 00:15:28,975
START TRYING NOW?

259
00:15:28,977 --> 00:15:31,811
>> WELL, FUNNY ENOUGH I HAD A

260
00:15:31,813 --> 00:15:33,746
DREAM WHERE MY SON CAME OUT OF

261
00:15:33,748 --> 00:15:36,749
MY ASS, WHICH DIDN'T MAKE ANY

262
00:15:36,751 --> 00:15:37,083
SENSE.

263
00:15:37,085 --> 00:15:38,017
>> NO.

264
00:15:38,019 --> 00:15:38,284
NO.

265
00:15:38,286 --> 00:15:40,186
>> NO, IT DOESN'T.

266
00:15:40,188 --> 00:15:40,653
>> RIGHT.

267
00:15:40,655 --> 00:15:42,055
BECAUSE THE BABY IS OBVIOUSLY

268
00:15:42,057 --> 00:15:43,690
GOING TO COME OUT OF MY ASS.

269
00:15:43,692 --> 00:15:44,557
>> NO.

270
00:15:44,559 --> 00:15:45,458
THAT WON'T HAPPEN.

271
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:46,893
>> CAN YOU JUST EXPLAIN EXACTLY

272
00:15:46,895 --> 00:15:48,494
HOW YOU THINK YOU'RE TRYING FOR

273
00:15:48,496 --> 00:15:49,896
A BABY?

274
00:15:49,898 --> 00:15:50,596
>> OKAY.

275
00:15:50,598 --> 00:15:52,699
GOD GOD, THIS IS SO INVASIVE.

276
00:15:52,701 --> 00:15:54,100
PEOPLE THINK THEY CAN JUST ASK

277
00:15:54,102 --> 00:15:55,001
GAY PEOPLE ANYTHING.

278
00:15:55,003 --> 00:15:55,968
IT'S CRAZY.

279
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:58,905
>> LOOK, ALL WE FEEL COMFORTABLE

280
00:15:58,907 --> 00:16:02,108
SHARING IS WE'VE TRIED THREE OUT

281
00:16:02,110 --> 00:16:02,608
OF SEVEN HOLES.

282
00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:03,643
>> SEVEN HOLES?

283
00:16:03,645 --> 00:16:05,345
>> WE ARE NOT GOING TO HOLD YOUR

284
00:16:05,347 --> 00:16:05,978
HAND THROUGH THAT.

285
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:08,214
>> EARS, EYES, PITS, CRACK --

286
00:16:08,216 --> 00:16:11,317
>> BABY, DON'T.

287
00:16:11,319 --> 00:16:11,818
THEY CAN GOOGLE.

288
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:14,220
>> GUYS, WE LOVE YOU, BUT YOU

289
00:16:14,222 --> 00:16:15,588
TWO CAN'T HAVE A BABY.

290
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:16,756
YOU BIOLOGICALLY CANNOT.

291
00:16:16,758 --> 00:16:17,857
>> OH, REALLY?

292
00:16:17,859 --> 00:16:20,393
WELL, YEARS BEFORE THERE WERE

293
00:16:20,395 --> 00:16:23,329
PHONES, I'M SURE SOMEONE SAID WE

294
00:16:23,331 --> 00:16:25,098
CAN'T HAVE PHONES, WE'LL NEVER

295
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:28,067
HAVE PHONES, AND NOW WE HAVE

296
00:16:28,069 --> 00:16:28,401
PHONES.

297
00:16:28,403 --> 00:16:28,701
GIRL.

298
00:16:28,703 --> 00:16:29,936
>> THINGS IN THE SCIENCE

299
00:16:29,938 --> 00:16:31,304
COMMUNITY CHANGE SO FAST.

300
00:16:31,306 --> 00:16:34,474
YEARS FROM NOW, YOU'RE GOING TO

301
00:16:34,476 --> 00:16:36,843
FEEL SO SMALL-MINDED.

302
00:16:36,845 --> 00:16:38,010
IMAGINE GOING BACK TO THE

303
00:16:38,012 --> 00:16:40,046
PILGRIMS AND TRYING TO EXPLAIN

304

ANDY MILLINACAS.

305
00:16:42,784 --> 00:16:44,817
BY THE WAY, MY BIRTHDAY IS

>> I WISHED THAT WE GET PREGNANT

319
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,212
AND THEY NEVER DO.

320
00:17:13,214 --> 00:17:13,880
>> HEY!

321
00:17:13,882 --> 00:17:14,680

331
00:17:28,596 --> 00:17:29,629

333
00:17:31,032 --> 00:17:32,932
I'M JUST EXPECTING TO HAVE A

340
00:18:05,539 --> 00:18:10,765
MY MOM HAS NOT CHANGED THIS ROOM
SINCE I LEFT FOR COLLEGE.

341
00:18:10,765 --> 00:18:13,261
>> OH, LOOK AT YOU.

342
00:18:13,261 --> 00:18:16,139
WHO'S THIS?
>> OH, THAT'S KEITH.

343
00:18:16,139 --> 00:18:19,488
HE WAS MY BEST FRIEND GROWING
UP.
HE LIVED A FEW DOORS DOWN.

344
00:18:19,488 --> 00:18:23,880
MAN, I HAVEN'T SEEN KEITH IN

345
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:32,310
>> WELL, YOU SHOULD REACH OUT.

346
00:18:32,312 --> 00:18:33,978
IT'S ALWAYS NICE TO HEAR FROM AN

347
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:46,557
OLD FRIEND AT CHRISTMAS.

348

>> THAT'S NOT A GAY BAR, RIGHT?

359
00:19:11,251 --> 00:19:11,983
>> I DON'T THINK SO.

360
00:19:11,985 --> 00:19:12,683
IT'S JUST A BAR.

361
00:19:12,685 --> 00:19:13,751
>> IS IT MORE THAN A THOUSAND

362
00:19:13,753 --> 00:19:16,621
FEET FROM A SCHOOL?

363
00:19:16,623 --> 00:19:22,727

>> OKAY.

367
00:19:25,832 --> 00:19:27,765
>> FOR REAL, THOUGH, IS IT MORE

368
00:19:27,767 --> 00:19:30,468

369
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:31,569
>> PROBABLY.

370
00:19:31,571 --> 00:19:32,603
>> I'M IN.

371
00:19:32,605 --> 00:19:34,338

>> MOST OF MY FRIENDS CUT TIES

375
00:19:41,714 --> 00:19:42,914
AFTER ALL THAT STUFF WENT DOWN

376
00:19:42,916 --> 00:19:43,314
LAST YEAR.

>> BUNCH OF BS.

379
00:19:48,755 --> 00:19:50,721
A NETFLIX DOC MADE IT SEEM WORSE

380
00:19:50,723 --> 00:19:51,155
THAN IT WAS.

381
00:19:51,157 --> 00:19:53,891
>> BABE, GO ON NETFLIX AND

382

THE MAN WITH 600 KIDS.

384
00:19:58,765 --> 00:20:01,399
HOW A SPERM BANK JANITOR

385
00:20:01,401 --> 00:20:04,702
SECRETLY SWITCHED HUNDREDS OF

386
00:20:04,704 --> 00:20:06,203
DONOR SAMPLES WITH HIS OWN AND

387
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:07,038
GOT AWAY WITH IT.

388
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:09,440
>> ANYWAY, I'VE BEEN PRETTY

389
00:20:09,442 --> 00:20:09,907
LONELY.

390
00:20:09,909 --> 00:20:12,176
I LOST THE LOVE OF MY LIFE LAST

391
00:20:12,178 --> 00:20:12,476
YEAR.

392
00:20:12,478 --> 00:20:13,644

393
00:20:13,646 --> 00:20:20,217

IT'S CRAZY THEY CAN JUST TAKE A

395
00:20:20,987 --> 00:20:21,719
GUN AWAY FROM YOU BECAUSE OF

396
00:20:21,721 --> 00:20:26,357
WHAT YOU SAY ONLINE.

397
00:20:26,359 --> 00:20:28,426
>> YOU SENT A THUMBS UP TO THAT?

398
00:20:28,428 --> 00:20:29,860
>> WHAT WAS I SUPPOSED TO SAY?

399
00:20:29,862 --> 00:20:31,896
>> ANYWAY, CAN'T WAIT TO HANG.

400
00:20:31,898 --> 00:20:32,563
I HAVE SO MUCH TO TELL YOU

401

NO LICENSE.

405
00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:45,743
>> OH, DUI?

406
00:20:45,745 --> 00:20:48,980
>> NAH, CAN'T RENEW IT.

407

DMV IS WITHIN 1,000 FEET OF A

HIS FRIEND, I GUESS?

IT'S ALWAYS GREAT TO SEE YOU.

1013
00:42:07,058 --> 00:42:09,559
WHY DO YOU THINK MEN ARE

1014
00:42:09,561 --> 00:42:09,926
DEPRESSED?

1015
00:42:09,928 --> 00:42:12,495
>> COLIN, TO UNDERSTAND WHY MEN

1016
00:42:12,497 --> 00:42:15,231
ARE DEPRESSED, WE HAVE TO FIRST

1017
00:42:15,233 --> 00:42:17,734
TALK ABOUT WOMEN, AND I

1018
00:42:17,736 --> 00:42:18,234
UNDERSTAND WOMEN.

1019
00:42:18,236 --> 00:42:19,002
>> I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WANT TO

1020
00:42:19,004 --> 00:42:19,936
START WITH THAT, BUT --

1021
00:42:19,938 --> 00:42:21,070
>> NO, COLIN.

1022
00:42:21,072 --> 00:42:27,277
I GREW UP WITH ONLY WOMEN IN MY

1023
00:42:27,279 --> 00:42:27,577
HOUSE.

1024
00:42:27,579 --> 00:42:28,211
IT WAS ME, MY MOM, AND MY

1025
00:42:28,213 --> 00:42:28,544
SISTER.

1026
00:42:28,546 --> 00:42:29,312
IN HIGH SCHOOL, MY MOM'S BEST

1027

FRIEND AND HER DAUGHTER MOVED

1028

IN, SO IT WAS JUST ME AND FOUR

1029
00:42:32,050 --> 00:42:32,348
WOMEN.

1030
00:42:32,350 --> 00:42:34,017
AND WHEN THAT HAPPENS TO YOU,

1031
00:42:34,019 --> 00:42:35,451
COLIN, WHEN IT'S JUST YOU AND

1032
00:42:35,453 --> 00:42:37,120
FOUR WOMEN, YOU HAVE NO

1033
00:42:37,122 --> 00:42:37,520
CHOICE --

1034
00:42:37,522 --> 00:42:42,058
>> BUT TO BECOME THE MAN OF THE

1035
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:42,492
HOUSE?

1036
00:42:42,494 --> 00:42:43,226
>> WRONG.

1037
00:42:43,228 --> 00:42:44,260
TO BECOME A WOMAN.

1038
00:42:44,262 --> 00:42:46,796
I WAS A WOMAN FOR MANY YEARS,

1039
00:42:46,798 --> 00:42:47,096
COLIN.

1040
00:42:47,098 --> 00:42:48,531
A PROUD LATINA WOMAN.

1041
00:42:48,533 --> 00:42:53,336
I WAS LIVING A DOUBLE LIFE.

1042
00:42:53,772 --> 00:42:55,805
AT SCHOOL, I WAS CAPTAIN OF THE

1043
00:42:55,807 --> 00:42:57,974
SOCCER TEAM YELLING YOU BETTER

1044
00:42:57,976 --> 00:42:59,509
PLAY DEFENSE TODAY.

1045
00:42:59,511 --> 00:43:02,378
AND AT HOME, MY MOM WOULD BE

1046
00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:03,880
LIKE, HOW DO I LOOK.

1047
00:43:03,882 --> 00:43:05,481
AND I WOULD BE LIKE, YOU LOOK

1048
00:43:05,483 --> 00:43:07,083
AMAZING MOMMY.

1049
00:43:07,085 --> 00:43:08,951
GO INTO YOUR ROOM AND WALK OUT

1050
00:43:08,953 --> 00:43:09,252
AGAIN.

1051
00:43:09,254 --> 00:43:10,520
I WANT TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

1052
00:43:10,522 --> 00:43:12,255
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

1053
00:43:12,257 --> 00:43:13,122
THE WHITE HOUSE?

1054
00:43:13,124 --> 00:43:14,724
IS MY MOM GOING TO MEET THE

1055
00:43:14,726 --> 00:43:15,091
PRESIDENT?

1056
00:43:15,093 --> 00:43:17,293
>> AND HOW DOES THIS RELATE TO

1057
00:43:17,295 --> 00:43:19,429
MEN BEING DEPRESSED?

1058
00:43:19,431 --> 00:43:21,431
>> BECAUSE, WOMEN SUPPORT EACH

1059
00:43:21,433 --> 00:43:21,798
OTHER.

1060
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:23,633
MEN DON'T SUPPORT EACH OTHER.

1061
00:43:23,635 --> 00:43:25,501
THAT'S WHY THEY'RE DEPRESSED.

1062
00:43:25,503 --> 00:43:27,503
A GIRL CAN TELL HER FRIEND

1063
00:43:27,505 --> 00:43:29,539
ANYTHING, AND SHE'LL SUPPORT IT

1064
00:43:29,541 --> 00:43:30,440
NO MATTER WHAT.

1065
00:43:30,442 --> 00:43:33,042
SHE'LL BE LIKE, I'M DATING THIS

1066
00:43:33,044 --> 00:43:38,047
GUY, AND HE ROBS BANKS.

1067
00:43:38,049 --> 00:43:38,715
AND THEN HER FRIEND WILL BE

1068
00:43:38,717 --> 00:43:44,921
LIKE, AT LEAST HE HAS A PASSION.

1069
00:43:44,923 --> 00:43:47,590
>> AND YOU DON'T THINK THAT MEN

1070
00:43:47,592 --> 00:43:48,458
ARE AS SUPPORTIVE?

1071
00:43:48,460 --> 00:43:50,126
>> NO, NOT AT ALL.

1072
00:43:50,128 --> 00:43:52,662
THAT'S WHY I DON'T GO TO THE

1073
00:43:52,664 --> 00:43:54,230
BARBERSHOP ANYMORE, COLIN.

1074
00:43:54,232 --> 00:43:56,466
IT'S A NEGATIVE ENERGY IN THERE.

1075
00:43:56,468 --> 00:43:57,834
NO ONE IS HAPPY TO SEE YOU.

1076
00:43:57,836 --> 00:43:59,902
EVERY TIME I GO, THE GUY'S LIKE,

1077
00:43:59,904 --> 00:44:01,104
LOOK WHO IT IS.

1078
00:44:01,106 --> 00:44:02,538
WE ALREADY TOLD YOU, BUDDY, WE

1079
00:44:02,540 --> 00:44:08,511
CAN'T MAKE YOU TALLER.

1080
00:44:08,513 --> 00:44:09,278
THAT'S WHY A LITTLE PRINCE LIKE

1081
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:12,281
ME GOES TO THE SALON, COLIN.

1082
00:44:12,283 --> 00:44:14,650
I GET TO THE SALON, COLIN, AND

1083
00:44:14,652 --> 00:44:18,488
THE LADY IS LIKE, WHERE HAVE YOU

1084
00:44:18,490 --> 00:44:18,788
BEEN?

1085
00:44:18,790 --> 00:44:22,358
AND I'M LIKE, I DON'T KNOW.

1086
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:28,097
I MISSED YOU.

1087
00:44:28,099 --> 00:44:31,167
>> OKAY.

1088
00:44:31,169 --> 00:44:33,369
THE SALON DO BE SOUNDING KIND OF

1089
00:44:33,371 --> 00:44:35,471
FIRE.

1090
00:44:35,473 --> 00:44:38,908
>> IT DO, IT DO, COLIN, IT DO!

1091
00:44:38,910 --> 00:44:41,210
I'M JUST TRYING TO SAY THAT

1092
00:44:41,212 --> 00:44:42,712
WOMEN HAVE SUPPORT, OKAY.

1093
00:44:42,714 --> 00:44:44,647
WHEN A WOMAN GOES THROUGH A

1094
00:44:44,649 --> 00:44:45,815
BREAKUP, ALL HER FRIENDS SHOW

1095
00:44:45,817 --> 00:44:46,115
UP.

1096
00:44:46,117 --> 00:44:47,750
WHEN A GUY GOES THROUGH A

1097
00:44:47,752 --> 00:44:50,019
BREAKUP, HIS BOYS JUST ACT LIKE

1098

HIS FLIGHT GOT DELAYED.

1099
00:44:52,390 --> 00:44:54,624
YOU'LL BE LIKE, YO, I WAS IN

1100
00:44:54,626 --> 00:44:56,659
LOVE WITH HER MAN, AND OUT OF

1101
00:44:56,661 --> 00:44:57,960
NOWHERE, SHE LEFT ME.

1102
00:44:57,962 --> 00:45:00,730
AND MY BEST FRIEND WILL BE LIKE,

1103
00:45:00,732 --> 00:45:01,030
DAMN.

1104
00:45:01,032 --> 00:45:03,132
THAT SUCKS, BRO.

1105
00:45:03,134 --> 00:45:05,768
JUST GO TO CHILI'S AND WAIT FOR

00:45:05,770 --> 00:45:08,204
THE NEXT ONE, MY BOY.

1107
00:45:08,206 --> 00:45:10,573
>> AND YOU WOULD SAY THIS IS THE

1108
00:45:10,575 --> 00:45:12,642
REASON MEN ARE THE MOST

1109

HISTORY?

1111

AND ALSO A VARIETY OF OTHER

1113
00:45:19,617 --> 00:45:21,150
DIFFERENT ISSUES, BUT THEY'RE

1114
00:45:21,152 --> 00:45:23,419
NOT AS FUNNY, AND I DON'T HAVE

1115
