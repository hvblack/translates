1
00:00:03,835 --> 00:00:06,627
>>> WOW, WHAT A DAY!

2
00:00:09,805 --> 00:00:12,875
YOU KNOW, YOUR SPEECH WAS
TERRIFIC, KETANJI.

3
00:00:12,875 --> 00:00:17,661
I'M SORRY, I MEAN, SUPREME COURT
JUSTICE KETANJI BROWN JACKSON.

4
00:00:20,084 --> 00:00:23,036
>> BET YOU CAN'T SAY THAT THREE
TIMES FAST.

5
00:00:23,036 --> 00:00:26,303
>> I WAS SHOCKED I'M ABLE TO SAY
IT ONE TIME SLOW.

6
00:00:26,303 --> 00:00:30,078
>> THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT.
I'M SO GRATEFUL YOU PUT YOUR
TRUST IN ME.

7
00:00:30,083 --> 00:00:34,362
>> I MADE A CAMPAIGN PROMISE TO
PUT A BLACK WOMAN ON THE COURT
AND I DID.

8
00:00:34,362 --> 00:00:38,439
ONE CAMPAIGN PROMISE DOWN, ONLY
74 MORE TO GO.

9
00:00:38,439 --> 00:00:40,736
>> I WAS HAPPY TO DO MY PART.

10
00:00:40,736 --> 00:00:43,202
WORK TWICE AS HARD AS A WHITE
MAN MY ENTIRE LIFE,

11
00:00:43,202 --> 00:00:47,130
THEN SPEND A
WEEK LISTENING TO TED CRUZ CALL
ME A PEDOPHILE.

12
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:50,603
>> MR. PRESIDENT, THE RECEPTION
STARTS IN FIVE MINUTES.
>> THANKS.

13
00:00:50,603 --> 00:00:52,045
I SHOULD GO GET READY.

14
00:00:52,045 --> 00:00:55,529
KETANJI, IT'S A BIG BAM DEAL,
RIGHT?

15
00:00:55,529 --> 00:00:59,513
YOU'RE THE FIRST BLACK FEMALE
JUSTICE BUT YOU WON'T BE THE
LAST.

16
00:00:59,513 --> 00:01:03,527
IT'S JUST A NORMAL THING NOW,
LIKE WEARING CROCS IN PUBLIC

17
00:01:03,654 --> 00:01:05,221
>> THANK YOU?

18
00:01:05,221 --> 00:01:09,620
>> TAKE A MOMENT IN THIS ROOM.

19
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:14,406
SOMETIMES I LIKE TO IMAGINE ALL
THE GREAT AMERICANS WHO CAME
HERE BEFORE ME.

20
00:01:14,464 --> 00:01:16,356
YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT I'M TRYING
TO SAY?

21
00:01:16,356 --> 00:01:18,361
>> THAT YOU MISS OBAMA?

22
00:01:18,361 --> 00:01:21,497
>> EVERY DAY LIKE CRAZY.

23
00:01:21,497 --> 00:01:24,147
>> MR. PRESIDENT, WE REALLY HAVE
TO GO.

24
00:01:24,147 --> 00:01:27,043
>> OKAY, I'LL SEE YOU IN A
MINUTE.
TAKE YOUR TIME.

25
00:01:27,043 --> 00:01:31,535
>> WOW.
THERE IS A LOT OF HISTORY IN
THIS ROOM.

26
00:01:31,535 --> 00:01:33,909
WHO WOULD I WANT TO TALK TO?

27
00:01:33,909 --> 00:01:36,227
OH, I KNOW.

28
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:44,026
GREET

29
00:01:44,026 --> 00:01:46,986
RUTH BADER GINSBURG, HOW IS THIS
POSSIBLE?

30
00:01:47,058 --> 00:01:49,807
IMAG

31
00:01:49,807 --> 00:01:51,698
ALL RIGHT.
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO KNOW?

32
00:01:51,698 --> 00:01:56,013
>> I WOULD LOVE SOME ADD VIEGS.

33
00:01:56,057 --> 00:01:58,321
>> OKAY.
HERE'S MY ADVICE.

34
00:01:58,321 --> 00:02:00,750
ALWAYS LABEL YOUR LUNCHES.

35
00:02:00,751 --> 00:02:04,342
FINGERS

36
00:02:04,342 --> 00:02:06,560
SECOND, IF YOU ARE ANYTHING LIKE ME,

37
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:11,152
WHITE LADIES WILL START WEAR
YOUR FACE WITH AN I VOTED
STICKER.

38
00:02:11,152 --> 00:02:13,961
FREAKY
WELL

39
00:02:13,961 --> 00:02:17,627
I'M SO PROUD OF YOU.
I KNOW YOU WILL DO A GREAT JOB.

40
00:02:17,627 --> 00:02:19,247
>> THANK YOU.
THAT MEANS A LOT.

41
00:02:19,247 --> 00:02:22,449
>> LOOK, I KNOW YOUR
CONFIRMATION PROCESS PUT YOU
THROUGH THE RINGER,

42
00:02:22,449 --> 00:02:24,747
BUT IT IS
END PEOPLE DID THE RIGHT THING.

43
00:02:24,748 --> 00:02:28,196
I WAS CONFIRMED

44
00:02:28,196 --> 00:02:31,307
>> WHAT WAS YOUR VOTE?
>> 53-47.

45
00:02:31,307 --> 00:02:33,665
>> YEAH.
YEAH.
A LOT WALKED OUT.

46
00:02:33,665 --> 00:02:37,188
ONE GUY KEPT ASKING ME IF BABIES
ARE RACIST.

47
00:02:37,188 --> 00:02:40,062
>> TEXAS.
>> YEAH.

48
00:02:40,062 --> 00:02:43,733
>> YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN THAT
MAN, HE ACTUALLY SAT THERE ON TV

49
00:02:43,733 --> 00:02:46,148
AND READ A CHILDREN'S BOOK AT
ME, HA.

50
00:02:46,148 --> 00:02:50,696
>> WELL, IT WAS TED CRUZ, SO I
BET THE BOOK WAS CALLED "GOOD
NIGHT CANCUN."

51
00:02:50,696 --> 00:02:52,766
THAT'S THE GINSBURG.

52
00:02:56,952 --> 00:02:58,338
>> DID I MISS IT?

53
00:02:58,338 --> 00:03:01,633
OH, DAMN.

54
00:03:01,633 --> 00:03:04,679
>> OH MY GOD, JUSTICE THURGOOD
MARSHALL!

55
00:03:04,679 --> 00:03:06,999
>> YES, THAT'S EXACTLY WHO
YOU'RE IMAGINING.

56
00:03:06,999 --> 00:03:10,859
WHAT AN EXCITING DAY.
WE'VE COME A LONG WAY.

57
00:03:10,859 --> 00:03:14,902
>> WELL, THANKS TO YOU.
YOU WERE ON THE FRONT LINES OF
THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT.

58
00:03:14,902 --> 00:03:19,611
>> YEP, I WAS THERE WHEN PEOPLE
OF COLOR IN THIS COUNTRY CAME
TOGETHER WITH ONE VOICE

59
00:03:19,611 --> 00:03:21,368
AND
SAID, ENOUGH IS ENOUGH.

60
00:03:21,368 --> 00:03:24,343
AND THEN WHITE FOLKS SAID, WE'LL
THINK ABOUT IT.

61
00:03:24,343 --> 00:03:26,239
BUT THAT WAS A DIFFERENT TIME.

62
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:28,343
>> SOME THINGS ARE STILL
SIMILAR?

63
00:03:28,343 --> 00:03:31,085
>> OH, YEAH.
THREAT OF NUCLEAR WAR WITH
RUSSIA?
>> YES.

64
00:03:31,085 --> 00:03:33,204
>> INFLATION STILL POPPING UP?
>> FOR SURE.

65
00:03:33,204 --> 00:03:36,546
>> JOE BIDEN STILL A POLITICIAN?
>> VERY MUCH SO?

66
00:03:36,546 --> 00:03:40,638
>> SO WHAT ADVISE TO YOU HAVE
FOR ME.

67
00:03:40,638 --> 00:03:42,542
>> WELL, NEVER GIVE UP.

68
00:03:42,542 --> 00:03:44,507
SLOW AND MESSY.

69
00:03:44,507 --> 00:03:47,115
IT STUMBLES, BUT OVER TIME IT
MOVES FORWARD.

70
00:03:47,115 --> 00:03:49,459
I WAS THE FIRST BLACK SUPREME COURT JUSTICE,

71
00:03:49,459 --> 00:03:51,982
SO YOU MUST BE
WHAT, THE 10th, THE 20th?

72
00:03:51,982 --> 00:03:53,769
>> NOPE, JUST THE THIRD.

73
00:03:53,769 --> 00:03:56,626
>> NO FURTHER QUESTIONS, YOUR
HONOR.

74
00:03:56,626 --> 00:03:59,896
>> YEAH.
I HAVE SOME QUESTIONS.

75
00:03:59,896 --> 00:04:02,183
>> HARRIET TUBMAN?
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

76
00:04:02,183 --> 00:04:06,321
AND CONDUCTOR OF THE UNDERGROUND
RAILROAD.

77
00:04:08,972 --> 00:04:13,087
>> MY QUESTION IS.
WHAT ARE WE DOING IN THE WHITE
HOUSE?

78
00:04:13,087 --> 00:04:14,555
DID WE GET IN TROUBLE?

79
00:04:14,555 --> 00:04:18,444
>> NOT AT ALL. BECAUSE OF WOMEN LIKE YOU

80
00:04:18,444 --> 00:04:20,480
A LOT OF DOORS OPENED UP TO A LOT
OF PEOPLE.

81
00:04:20,553 --> 00:04:23,336
>> I LIKE THAT.

82
00:04:23,336 --> 00:04:25,836
>> I HAVE A SEAT AT THE TABLE.
>> I LIKE THAT.

83
00:04:25,836 --> 00:04:30,245
>> AND I'M GOING TO HAVE THIS
JOB FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE.
>> DON'T LIKE THAT.

84
00:04:30,245 --> 00:04:34,010
>> TRAP

85
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:37,940
OKAY.
BUT IF IT IS, LIGHT TWO CANDLES

86
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:40,363
AND MEET ME IN THE FARMHOUSE AT
MIDNIGHT.

87
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:43,669
>> NO, I'M GOOD.
EXCITED

88
00:04:43,669 --> 00:04:47,263
I WOULD LIKE TO TALK TO ONE MORE
PERSON WHO BROKE DOWN A BARRIER.

89
00:04:47,263 --> 00:04:50,225
>> THAT'S MY, JACKIE ROBINSON.

90
00:04:50,635 --> 00:04:53,855
FIRST

91
00:04:53,855 --> 00:04:57,239
LET ME TELL YOU, BEING THE FIRST
IS KIND OF FUN.

92
00:04:57,239 --> 00:04:59,643
YEAH.
IT'S FUN.

93
00:04:59,643 --> 00:05:02,158
HERE'S MY ADVICE.
WATCH OUT FOR BATTERS.

94
00:05:02,158 --> 00:05:05,198
YOU WILL GET SO MANY BATTERIES
THROWN AT YOU.

95
00:05:05,198 --> 00:05:08,226
>> I THINK THE SUPREME COURT IS
TOO CIVILIZED FOR THAT.

96
00:05:08,226 --> 00:05:10,142
>> THAT'S WHAT THEY SAID ABOUT
BASEBALL.

97
00:05:10,142 --> 00:05:12,651
BUT THEY STILL THREW THOSE
BATTERIES, THOUGH.

98
00:05:12,651 --> 00:05:15,262
DAMN, WISH WE HAD HELMETS BACK
THEN, HA HA!

99
00:05:16,018 --> 00:05:20,721
THE GOOD NEWS IS, YOU'RE
PROBABLY MAKING A LOT MORE MONEY
THAN A BASEBALL PLAYER.

100
00:05:20,721 --> 00:05:24,673
>> I WISH.
BASEBALL PLAYERS TODAY AVERAGE
ABOUT $4 MILLION A YEAR.

101
00:05:24,673 --> 00:05:26,837
>> OH, EXCUSE ME FOR A SECOND.

102
00:05:28,318 --> 00:05:31,585
THANK YOU.
I'VE BEEN HOLDING THAT IN SINCE
1947.

103
00:05:31,585 --> 00:05:34,751
>> THANK YOU FOR YOUR ADVICE.

104
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:37,585
I WILL DO EVERYTHING I CAN TO
HONOR YOUR LEGACY.

105
00:05:37,585 --> 00:05:41,342
>> THAT'S GREAT.
EVEN THE BAD PLAYERS GET $4
MILLION A YEAR?
>> YEP.

106
00:05:41,342 --> 00:05:43,451
>> AIN'T THAT SOMETHING.

107
00:05:43,451 --> 00:05:48,197
AND LIVE FROM NEW YORK, IT'S
SATURDAY NIGHT!

108
00:07:58,494 --> 00:08:03,536
JAKE GYLLENHAAL!

109
00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:19,628
>> THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK
YOU.

110
00:08:19,628 --> 00:08:24,524
THANK YOU.
I'M SO EXCITED TO BE BACK AT
SNL.

111
00:08:24,524 --> 00:08:28,839
THE LAST TIME I HOSTED WAS THE
YEAR 2007.

112
00:08:28,839 --> 00:08:33,513
YOU KNOW HOW LONG AGO THAT WAS?
THAT WAS LIKE 400 MARVEL MOVIES
AGO.

113
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:36,755
TO GIVE YOU AN IDEA OF WHAT IT
WAS LIKE IN 2007,

114
00:08:36,755 --> 00:08:41,202
IN THE SHOW I
HOSTED --
THERE WAS A GEORGE W. BUSH
SKETCH.

115
00:08:41,202 --> 00:08:44,123
THERE WERE JOKES ABOUT THE FIRST
iPHONE.

116
00:08:44,123 --> 00:08:48,181
AND THIS IS A PHOTO OF ME FROM
MY MONOLOGUE.

117
00:08:49,199 --> 00:08:53,772
YEAH.
THERE I AM IN FULL DRAG SINGING
A SONG FROM "DREAM GLS GIRLS"

118
00:08:53,772 --> 00:08:57,338
TO
PROMOTE A MOVIE WHERE I PLAYED A
GAY COWBOY.

119
00:09:03,548 --> 00:09:07,783
AND THAT WAS ACTUALLY THE LEAST
PROBLEMATIC THING IN THAT
EPISODE.

120
00:09:07,783 --> 00:09:11,604
LOOKING BACK, I FEEL LIKE I WAS
A TOTALLY DIFFERENT PERSON.

121
00:09:11,604 --> 00:09:16,757
YOU KNOW,
IT'S FUNNY.
I GOT THIS REPUTATION FOR BEING
THIS SERIOUS, INTENSE METHOD
ACTOR.

122
00:09:16,757 --> 00:09:20,169
BUT HONESTLY, I WASN'T EVEN THAT
GOOD AT METHOD ACTING.

123
00:09:20,169 --> 00:09:23,347
I REMEMBER FOR THIS MOVIE
NIGHTCRAWLER, I WENT TO THE DIRECTOR

124
00:09:23,414 --> 00:09:28,163
AND I WAS LIKE, GET
READY FOR ME TO LOSE 48 POUNDS
AND WIN THE OSCAR.

125
00:09:28,163 --> 00:09:32,352
AND THEN A WEEK LATER I WAS
LIKE, HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE
AN ACTOR LOSE 36 POUNDS

126
00:09:32,352 --> 00:09:35,079
AND WIN
THE GOLDEN GLOBE?

127
00:09:35,079 --> 00:09:40,489
AND THEN I SHOWED UP ON SET AND
I WAS LIKE, YOU'RE LOOKING AT A
GUY WHO GAINED 10 POUNDS

128
00:09:40,489 --> 00:09:42,536
AND
DOESN'T CARE ABOUT AWARDS.

129
00:09:42,536 --> 00:09:46,291
THE TRUTH IS, I WAS ONLY DOING
THAT METHOD STUFF

130
00:09:46,291 --> 00:09:49,829
BECAUSE I
THOUGHT THAT'S WHAT YOU HAD TO
DO TO BE A SERIOUS ACTOR,

131
00:09:49,892 --> 00:09:53,179
AND I
KIND OF FORGOT HOW TO HAVE FUN.

132
00:09:53,179 --> 00:09:57,297
THAT'S WHEN I REALIZED SOMETHING
I SHOULD HAVE REALIZED A LONG
TIME AGO.

133
00:09:57,297 --> 00:10:01,462
ACTING IS A REALLY STUPID JOB.

134
00:10:01,699 --> 00:10:07,189
IT'S PRETEND.
AND IT'S FUN AND IT SHOULD BE
FILLED WITH JOY.

135
00:10:07,189 --> 00:10:10,344
WELL, I'M FINALLY EMBRACING THAT
JOY AGAIN,

136
00:10:10,344 --> 00:10:14,059
AND THAT'S WHY I'M
BACK STANDING ON THIS STAGE.

137
00:10:19,183 --> 00:10:24,252
>> I MEAN, I NEVER THOUGHT "SNL"
WOULD COME CALLING AGAIN.

138
00:10:24,523 --> 00:10:29,061
I MEAN, IT'S BEEN 15 YEARS.

139
00:10:29,061 --> 00:10:33,328
I WASN'T SURE I'D REMEMBER HOW
TO HOST.

140
00:10:33,328 --> 00:10:38,763
BUT BEING HERE TONIGHT, IT FEELS
LIKE EVERYTHING IS SUDDENLY

141
00:10:39,394 --> 00:10:41,893
COMING BACK.

142
00:10:44,539 --> 00:10:50,334
* THERE WERE NIGHTS WHEN THE
WIND WAS SO COLD

143
00:10:50,334 --> 00:10:52,585
THAT MY BODY
FROZE IN BED *

144
00:10:52,585 --> 00:10:59,290
* IF I JUST LISTENED TO IT RIGHT
OUTSIDE THE WINDOW

145
00:11:00,891 --> 00:11:03,855
* WHEN I SEE YOU LIKE THIS

146
00:11:03,855 --> 00:11:06,430
AND I
HOST YOU LIKE THAT *

147
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:08,656
* I JUST HAVE TO ADMIT

148
00:11:08,656 --> 00:11:12,464
THAT IT'S ALL COMING BACK TO ME *

149
00:11:12,464 --> 00:11:17,120
* IT'S ALL COMING BACK IT'S ALL
COMING BACK TO ME NOW *

150
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:22,424
* MOMENTS OF GOLD AND THERE WERE
FLASHES OF LIGHT *

151
00:11:22,424 --> 00:11:27,437
* THERE WERE SKETCHES I'D NEVER
DO AGAIN BUT THEN THEY ALWAYS
SEEMED RIGHT *

152
00:11:27,437 --> 00:11:29,897
** THERE WERE NIGHTS OF ENDLESS
PLEASURE.

153
00:11:29,897 --> 00:11:35,869
** IT WAS MORE THAN ANY SHOWS
ALLOWED.

154
00:11:35,869 --> 00:11:47,415
BABY BABY *

155
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:53,167
* IF YOU WANT ME LIKE THIS
IF YOU NEED ME LIKE THAT *

156
00:11:53,167 --> 00:11:55,355
* IT WAS ALL FOR THE GOOD

157
00:11:55,355 --> 00:11:58,303
BUT IT'S ALL COMING BACK TO ME *

158
00:11:58,303 --> 00:12:00,297
* I CAN BARELY RECALL

159
00:12:00,297 --> 00:12:06,275
BUT IT'S ALL COMING BACK TO ME NOW *

160
00:12:06,275 --> 00:12:09,850
>> WE HAVE A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU
TONIGHT.
CAMILA CABELLO IS HERE

161
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:12,888
SO STICK
AROUND, WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK!

162
00:12:20,535 --> 00:12:23,078
LOVE

163
00:12:23,078 --> 00:12:27,501
WHY'D YOU LIKE
IT" WITH YOUR HOST
DENNY DONIGAN.

164
00:12:30,076 --> 00:12:33,529
>> ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.
WELCOME TO "WHY'D YOU LIKE IT?"

165
00:12:33,529 --> 00:12:37,062
THE GAME SHOW WHERE WE ASK
CONTESTANTS, "WHY'D YOU LIKE
IT?"

166
00:12:37,062 --> 00:12:38,608
I'M YOUR HOST DENNY DONEGAN,

167
00:12:38,608 --> 00:12:43,156
AND TONIGHT'S CONTESTANTS ARE
BETH --
>> HI, CAN'T WAIT TO PLAY.

168
00:12:43,156 --> 00:12:46,941
>> KENNY --
>> SUP, Y'ALL, LET'S DO THIS.

169
00:12:46,941 --> 00:12:49,973
>> AND BRAD.
>> EXCITED TO BE HERE, DENNY.

170
00:12:49,973 --> 00:12:53,851
I'M STILL NOT TOTALLY SURE WHAT
THIS SHOW IS, BUT LOOKING
FORWARD TO FINDING OUT.

171
00:12:53,851 --> 00:12:58,526
>> WELL, THE GAME IS EASY.
WE SHOW YOU A PICTURE THAT YOU
LIKED ON INSTAGRAM,

172
00:12:58,526 --> 00:13:03,362
AND ASK YOU
THE SIMPLE QUESTION, "WHY'D YOU
LIKE IT?"

173
00:13:03,362 --> 00:13:08,487
SO BRAD, LET'S START WITH YOU.
>> UH, OKAY.

174
00:13:08,487 --> 00:13:12,981
>> ON MARCH 19th, YOU LIKED THIS
PHOTO.

175
00:13:13,309 --> 00:13:17,962
SO THE QUESTION IS, "WHY'D YOU
LIKE IT?"

176
00:13:18,889 --> 00:13:21,188
>> UH -- SHE'S MY FRIEND.

177
00:13:21,188 --> 00:13:23,449
I LIKE HER DOG?

178
00:13:23,449 --> 00:13:25,783
I THOUGHT SHE WAS ATTRACTIVE.

179
00:13:25,783 --> 00:13:28,394
>> STILL DOESN'T EXPLAIN WHY YOU
LIKED IT.

180
00:13:28,394 --> 00:13:32,318
I MEAN, YOU COULD HAVE JUST
LOOKED AT IT, BUT YOU DID THE
DOUBLE TAP.

181
00:13:32,318 --> 00:13:35,741
SO THE QUESTION REMAINS, WHY?

182
00:13:35,741 --> 00:13:39,554
>> I GUESS SOME PART OF ME
THOUGHT THAT IF I LIKED IT,

183
00:13:39,554 --> 00:13:43,456
SHE
WOULD SEE THAT I LIKE IT,
AND THEN SHE WOULD FOLLOW ME BACK,
THEN WE'D DM,

184
00:13:43,456 --> 00:13:47,104
AND THEN MAYBE AT
SOME POINT, I DON'T KNOW, SHE'D
WANT TO HAVE SEX WITH ME.

185
00:13:47,104 --> 00:13:50,094
>> THAT IS CORRECT.

186
00:13:50,094 --> 00:13:52,077
THANK

187
00:13:52,077 --> 00:13:56,268
AND JUST TO BE CLEAR, YOUR
GIRLFRIEND IS HERE TONIGHT?

188
00:13:56,268 --> 00:13:58,087
>> SHE -- SHE IS, YEAH.

189
00:13:58,087 --> 00:14:01,131
>> YOU ARE A STUPID MAN.

190
00:14:01,131 --> 00:14:05,649
>> I REALLY DIDN'T UNDERSTAND
THE PREMISE OF THE SHOW.

191
00:14:05,649 --> 00:14:08,517
>> ALL RIGHT, NEXT UP WE GOT
KENNY.

192
00:14:08,517 --> 00:14:10,642
>> PASS.

193
00:14:10,642 --> 00:14:13,392
>> NOPE.
YOU CAN'T PASS.

194
00:14:13,392 --> 00:14:18,382
ALL RIGHT.
TWO WEEKS AGO, YOU LIKED THIS
PHOTO.

195
00:14:18,382 --> 00:14:21,651
>> OKAY, THAT'S ART.
THAT'S NOT EVEN BAD.

196
00:14:21,651 --> 00:14:26,163
>> ALL RIGHT.
THEN THIS QUESTION SHOULD BE
EASY.
WHY'D YOU LIKE IT?

197
00:14:26,163 --> 00:14:28,205
>> I'M CULTURED.

198
00:14:28,205 --> 00:14:33,514
>> I'D LIKE TO POINT OUT THIS
ART PHOTO WAS POSTED BY
MEGANTHESTALLION.

199
00:14:33,514 --> 00:14:38,313
WHO HAS 28 MILLION FOLLOWERS,
AND AVERAGES 2 MILLION LIKES PER
POST.

200
00:14:38,313 --> 00:14:41,283
SO AGAIN, WHY'D YOU LIKE IT?

201
00:14:41,283 --> 00:14:43,211
>> I'M A FAN OF HER MUSIC.

202
00:14:43,211 --> 00:14:44,832
I'M A FAN OF HER ART.

203
00:14:44,832 --> 00:14:47,173
I'M A FAN OF INSTAGRAM IN
GENERAL.

204
00:14:47,173 --> 00:14:52,847
OKAY, I GUESS I -- I SAW THAT
THIS POST WAS GETTING LESS LIKES
THAN THE ONES WITH MEGAN'S FACE
AND BOOTY.

205
00:14:52,847 --> 00:14:56,210
SO I THOUGHT IF I LIKED THIS
ONE, IT'S MORE LIKELY THAT SHE'D SEE IT,

206
00:14:56,210 --> 00:15:01,191
AND SHE'D KNOW THAT I
LIKE HER FOR MORE THAN HER BODY,
BUT LIKE, ALSO HER MIND.

207
00:15:01,191 --> 00:15:04,603
AND THEN IT'D BE LIKE A
NOTTING HILL TYPE OF
SITUATION,

208
00:15:04,603 --> 00:15:08,924
SHE'D DM ME, ONE THING LEADS TO
ANOTHER, AND PRETTY SOON WE'RE
HAVING SEX.

209
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:12,258
>> WOW.
THAT'S PATHETIC.

210
00:15:12,258 --> 00:15:14,468
>> DO NOT SPEAK.

211
00:15:14,468 --> 00:15:17,010
>> CAN I LEAVE?
>> NOPE.

212
00:15:17,010 --> 00:15:18,523
ALL RIGHT, BETH, YOU'RE UP.

213
00:15:18,523 --> 00:15:24,587
>> OKAY, WELL, THIS SHOULD BE
EASY FOR ME, BECAUSE I DON'T GO
AROUND LIKING THIRST TRAPS ON
INSTAGRAM.

214
00:15:25,844 --> 00:15:27,528
>> HA HA, LOVE THE CONFIDENCE.

215
00:15:27,528 --> 00:15:32,398
BECAUSE YESTERDAY YOU LIKED THIS
PHOTO FROM 2017.

216
00:15:32,402 --> 00:15:34,091
>> SEEMS FINE.

217
00:15:34,091 --> 00:15:37,897
>> IT IS A PICTURE OF YOUR
EX-BOYFRIEND'S SISTER.

218
00:15:37,897 --> 00:15:40,362
SO, WHY'D YOU LIKE IT?

219
00:15:40,362 --> 00:15:42,457
>> WE STILL KEEP IN TOUCH.

220
00:15:42,457 --> 00:15:44,730
I LIKE HER DOG.

221
00:15:44,730 --> 00:15:47,521
WATERFALL.

222
00:15:47,521 --> 00:15:51,440
>> YOU SCROLLED BACK FIVE YEARS
TO LIKE IT.

223
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:55,196
>> OKAY.
I THOUGHT THAT IF I LIKED THE PHOTO,

224
00:15:55,196 --> 00:15:58,569
SHE'D SEE MY NAME POP UP
ON HER FEED AND REMEMBER THAT I
WAS NICE.

225
00:15:58,569 --> 00:16:01,799
AND THEN MAYBE AT THE NEXT
FAMILY DINNER, SHE'D TURN TO MY EX

226
00:16:01,799 --> 00:16:04,077
AND BE LIKE, "YOU KNOW WHO I
MISS?
BETH!"

227
00:16:04,077 --> 00:16:07,891
AND THEN MY EX WOULD DM ME AND
MAYBE SAY,
LET'S GRAB A COFFEE SOMETIME.

228
00:16:07,891 --> 00:16:13,101
CUT TO TWO HOURS LATER AND WE'RE
RAW-DOGGING IN A STARBUCKS
BATHROOM.

229
00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:16,137
>> WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU
PEOPLE?

230
00:16:16,137 --> 00:16:18,635
>> WHY DID YOU BRING US HERE?

231
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:25,665
>> UH-OH, YOU KNOW WHAT THAT
SOUND MEANS.
>> YOU KNOW THAT WE DON'T.

232
00:16:25,665 --> 00:16:27,850
>> WELL, IT'S TIME FOR ROUND
TWO.

233
00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:30,422
WHY DO YOU FOLLOW 'EM?

234
00:16:30,422 --> 00:16:34,084
SHOW

235
00:16:34,084 --> 00:16:38,345
TELL ME,

236
00:16:38,345 --> 00:16:40,388
>> PASS.

237
00:16:40,388 --> 00:16:42,684
>> IT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

238
00:16:42,684 --> 00:16:48,494
ALL RIGHT.
LET'S GET THAT PROFILE UP.
YOU ALL FOLLOW JOE BIDEN.

239
00:16:48,565 --> 00:16:52,036
WHY?
>> HE'S THE PRESIDENT.

240
00:16:52,036 --> 00:16:54,445
>> HE KNOWS OBAMA.

241
00:16:54,445 --> 00:16:58,608
>> DURING THE ELECTION, I FELT
LIKE I WASN'T DOING ENOUGH POLITICALLY,

242
00:16:58,608 --> 00:17:02,375
SO I THOUGHT
FOLLOWING JOE BIDEN WAS
LITERALLY THE LEAST I COULD DO.

243
00:17:02,375 --> 00:17:04,230
>> SO CLOSE.

244
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:09,692
>> AND I THOUGHT MAYBE IF
SOMEONE POLITICAL SAW I WAS
FOLLOWING HIM, THEY'D WANT
TO HAVE SEX WITH ME.

245
00:17:09,761 --> 00:17:12,164
>> I'M GONNA KILL YOU.

246
00:17:12,164 --> 00:17:15,191
>> I -- I WASN'T GONNA DO
ANYTHING --

247
00:17:16,345 --> 00:17:20,804
UNLESS ONE OF THEM DMED ME AND
COMMENTED ON
ONE OF MY PHOTOS.

248
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:25,258
ALL -- ALL RIGHT, LOOK, MAYBE --
MAYBE IN THE PAST I'VE BEEN
PRETTY SHALLOW WHEN IT COMES TO
SOCIAL MEDIA.

249
00:17:25,312 --> 00:17:28,898
BUT THANKS TO THIS GAME SHOW, I
NOW REALIZE SOCIAL MEDIA IS NOT MY FRIEND

250
00:17:28,898 --> 00:17:32,246
AND MAYBE IT'S TIME TO
GET OFF THIS THING FOR GOOD.

251
00:17:32,327 --> 00:17:36,764
>> OKAY, WELL IN THE TIME IT
TOOK FOR THE CAMERA TO CUT TO ME JUST NOW,

252
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:42,267
YOU LIKED, UN-LIKED,
AND LIKED AGAIN THIS PHOTO.

253
00:17:42,943 --> 00:17:47,017
>> I'M SORRY, I CANNOT CHANGE.
>> UNDERSTOOD.

254
00:17:47,017 --> 00:17:49,734
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK AFTER THE
BREAK WITH ROUND THREE,

255
00:17:49,734 --> 00:17:53,178
"WHY

256
00:17:53,178 --> 00:17:55,028
STICK AROUND!

257
00:18:07,053 --> 00:18:12,325
>> WE'RE THE "DREAM HOME

258
00:18:07,053 --> 00:18:12,325
COUSINS."

259
00:18:07,053 --> 00:18:12,325
>> MY COUSIN GAGE AND I HAVE

260
00:18:12,325 --> 00:18:21,167
BEEN HARD AT WORK DESIGNING A

261
00:18:12,325 --> 00:18:21,167
DREAM HOME FOR LILIAN AND HER

262
00:18:12,325 --> 00:18:21,167
QUIET, MILQUETOAST HUSBAND PAT.

263
00:18:21,167 --> 00:18:24,337
WHO IS DEEPLY UNCOMFORTABLE ON

264
00:18:21,167 --> 00:18:24,337
CAMERA.

265
00:18:21,167 --> 00:18:24,337
AND NOW, WE'RE READY TO SHOW

266
00:18:24,337 --> 00:18:26,106
THEM THE PLANS WE DREW UP.

267
00:18:24,337 --> 00:18:26,106
>> FOR THE RECORD, I DID MOST OF

268
00:18:24,337 --> 00:18:26,106
THE DRAWING.

269
00:18:26,106 --> 00:18:32,579
>> OH, BROTHER.

270
00:18:26,106 --> 00:18:32,579
>> DON'T YOU MEAN, "OH, COUSIN"?

271
00:18:32,579 --> 00:18:36,249
>> LILIAN, PAT?

272
00:18:32,579 --> 00:18:36,249
YOU GUYS READY TO SEE OUR FINAL

273
00:18:32,579 --> 00:18:36,249
DESIGN?

274
00:18:36,249 --> 00:18:42,689
>> YES, I'M SO EXCITED.

275
00:18:36,249 --> 00:18:42,689
>> PAT?

276
00:18:36,249 --> 00:18:42,689
>> NOW, WE ALL AGREED ON A

277
00:18:42,689 --> 00:18:48,862
DESIGN.

278
00:18:42,689 --> 00:18:48,862
BUT YOU GUYS THREW US A BIT OF A

279
00:18:42,689 --> 00:18:48,862
CURVEBALL WHEN PAT INFORMED US

280
00:18:48,862 --> 00:18:53,767
THAT HIS MOTHER, BEA, AND HER

281
00:18:48,862 --> 00:18:53,767
27-YEAR-OLD CAT, CHARLES-DAVID,

282
00:18:48,862 --> 00:18:53,767
WOULD ALSO BE MOVING INTO YOUR

283
00:18:53,767 --> 00:18:57,804
HOUSE.

284
00:18:53,767 --> 00:18:57,804
WHICH REQUIRED US TO CHANGE A

285
00:18:53,767 --> 00:18:57,804
FEW THINGS.

286
00:18:57,804 --> 00:19:01,007
>> BUT IT'S STILL GOING TO BE MY

287
00:18:57,804 --> 00:19:01,007
DREAM HOUSE, RIGHT?

288
00:18:57,804 --> 00:19:01,007
WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT?

289
00:19:01,007 --> 00:19:03,743
>> YOU BET, JUST SLIGHTLY

290
00:19:01,007 --> 00:19:03,743
MODIFIED.

291
00:19:01,007 --> 00:19:03,743
LET'S START WITH THE LIVING

292
00:19:03,743 --> 00:19:08,882
ROOM.

293
00:19:03,743 --> 00:19:08,882
>> LILIAN, YOU WANTED THIS SPACE

294
00:19:03,743 --> 00:19:08,882
TO BE, QUOTE, "AN OASIS OF

295
00:19:08,882 --> 00:19:14,654
RELAXATION."

296
00:19:08,882 --> 00:19:14,654
>> OH, I LOVE THAT.

297
00:19:08,882 --> 00:19:14,654
>> BUT BEA WANTED THIS SPACE TO

298
00:19:14,654 --> 00:19:20,427
BE, QUOTE, "WHERE WE PUT MY

299
00:19:14,654 --> 00:19:20,427
CAT'S MEDICAL EQUIPMENT."

300
00:19:14,654 --> 00:19:20,427
>> AND UNFORTUNATELY, THE AMOUNT

301
00:19:20,427 --> 00:19:24,297
OF MACHINERY IT TAKES TO KEEP A

302
00:19:20,427 --> 00:19:24,297
27-YEAR-OLD CAT WITH NO KIDNEYS

303
00:19:20,427 --> 00:19:24,297
ALIVE REALLY CLUTTERED UP THE

304
00:19:24,297 --> 00:19:29,936
SPACE.

305
00:19:24,297 --> 00:19:29,936
>> GOD -- THIS CAT.

306
00:19:24,297 --> 00:19:29,936
>> NOW FOR THE KITCHEN.

307
00:19:29,936 --> 00:19:32,505
WE THOUGHT THIS CAPTURED

308
00:19:29,936 --> 00:19:32,505
LILIAN'S VISION OF AN OPEN

309
00:19:29,936 --> 00:19:32,505
CONCEPT DESIGN.

310
00:19:32,505 --> 00:19:36,376
>> OH, WOW.

311
00:19:32,505 --> 00:19:36,376
>> AND WE WOULD HAVE LOVED TO

312
00:19:32,505 --> 00:19:36,376
BUILD THAT, BUT SINCE BEA'S

313
00:19:36,376 --> 00:19:39,913
GOING TO BE DOING MOST OF THE

314
00:19:36,376 --> 00:19:39,913
COOKING --

315
00:19:36,376 --> 00:19:39,913
>> ALL THE COOKING.

316
00:19:39,913 --> 00:19:44,117
SKINNY MINI CAN'T COOK.

317
00:19:39,913 --> 00:19:44,117
>> WE WENT WITH A MORE CLOSED

318
00:19:39,913 --> 00:19:44,117
CONCEPT FEEL.

319
00:19:44,117 --> 00:19:49,389
>> AND SINCE BEA IS AFRAID OF

320
00:19:44,117 --> 00:19:49,389
GAS, WE SWAPPED THE SIX-BURNER

321
00:19:44,117 --> 00:19:49,389
VIKING RANGE FOR AN OLIVE GREEN

322
00:19:49,389 --> 00:19:54,627
ELECTRIC STOVE AND OSTER TOASTER

323
00:19:49,389 --> 00:19:54,627
OVEN, BOTH FROM BEA'S CURRENT

324
00:19:49,389 --> 00:19:54,627
HOME, AND BOTH MANUFACTURED

325
00:19:54,627 --> 00:19:58,865
IN 1978.

326
00:19:54,627 --> 00:19:58,865
>> BACK WHEN AMERICA STILL BUILT

327
00:19:54,627 --> 00:19:58,865
THINGS.

328
00:19:58,865 --> 00:20:05,171
>> ARE YOU GONNA PICK ANYTHING I

329
00:19:58,865 --> 00:20:05,171
WANT?

330
00:19:58,865 --> 00:20:05,171
>> NOW LILIAN, I SENSE THAT

331
00:20:05,171 --> 00:20:07,907
YOU'RE PROBABLY FEELING THAT

332
00:20:05,171 --> 00:20:07,907
YOUR VISION HAS BEEN COMPROMISED

333
00:20:05,171 --> 00:20:07,907
DOWNSTAIRS.

334
00:20:07,907 --> 00:20:15,181
>> YES.

335
00:20:07,907 --> 00:20:15,181
>> BUT UPSTAIRS?

336
00:20:07,907 --> 00:20:15,181
>> HAS ALSO BEEN COMPROMISED.

337
00:20:15,181 --> 00:20:18,852
WE HAD TO PARTITION THE GRAND

338
00:20:15,181 --> 00:20:18,852
STAIRCASE TO ACCOMMODATE

339
00:20:15,181 --> 00:20:18,852
CHARLES-DAVID'S MOTORIZED

340
00:20:18,852 --> 00:20:23,590
STAIR-CHAIR.

341
00:20:18,852 --> 00:20:23,590
>> BUT GOOD NEWS, LILIAN, WE

342
00:20:18,852 --> 00:20:23,590
WERE ABLE TO PRESERVE YOUR YOGA

343
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:30,430
STUDIO FROM OUR ORIGINAL DESIGN.

344
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:30,430
>> YAY, IT'S PERFECT.

345
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:30,430
>> BUT IT WILL HAVE TO DOUBLE AS

346
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:37,804
THE DISPLAY ROOM FOR BEA'S

347
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:37,804
COLLECTION OF WISE QUACKERS.

348
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:37,804
LARGE, CERAMIC STATUE'S OF DUCKS

349
00:20:37,804 --> 00:20:44,611
IN 1930s GANGSTER OUTFITS.

350
00:20:37,804 --> 00:20:44,611
AND WITH 90 WISE QUACKERS TO

351
00:20:37,804 --> 00:20:44,611
DISPLAY, THE YOGA STUDIO WILL BE

352
00:20:44,611 --> 00:20:51,484
A LITTLE CRAMPED.

353
00:20:44,611 --> 00:20:51,484
SO, WHAT DO WE THINK SO FAR?

354
00:20:44,611 --> 00:20:51,484
>> I THINK THAT SKINNY MINI

355
00:20:51,484 --> 00:20:55,689
OPENED HER LEGS AND STOLE MY

356
00:20:51,484 --> 00:20:55,689
SON.

357
00:20:51,484 --> 00:20:55,689
I KNOW SHE TOOK YOUR SWEETNESS

358
00:20:55,689 --> 00:21:01,061
BEFORE YOUR WEDDING NIGHT.

359
00:20:55,689 --> 00:21:01,061
>> WHAT, YOU TOLD HER?

360
00:20:55,689 --> 00:21:01,061
>> I GAVE MY SWEETNESS.

361
00:21:01,061 --> 00:21:04,798
>> OH, MY GOD.

362
00:21:01,061 --> 00:21:04,798
>> OKAY, LET'S SHOW YOU WHAT WE

363
00:21:01,061 --> 00:21:04,798
CAME UP WITH FOR THE PRIMARY

364
00:21:04,798 --> 00:21:11,504
BEDROOM.

365
00:21:04,798 --> 00:21:11,504
>> OH, THAT'S GORGEOUS.

366
00:21:04,798 --> 00:21:11,504
>> HERE'S WHERE WE LANDED AFTER

367
00:21:11,504 --> 00:21:15,709
TALKING TO BEA.

368
00:21:11,504 --> 00:21:15,709
SINCE THIS WILL BE HER BEDROOM

369
00:21:11,504 --> 00:21:15,709
AS WELL, WE'LL SWAP THE KING BED

370
00:21:15,709 --> 00:21:18,845
FOR THREE SINGLES.

371
00:21:15,709 --> 00:21:18,845
>> AND SINCE BEA HATES LARGE

372
00:21:15,709 --> 00:21:18,845
OPEN SPACES --

373
00:21:18,845 --> 00:21:22,749
>> THE DEVIL'S IN THE RAFTERS.

374
00:21:18,845 --> 00:21:22,749
>> THE 15 FOOT CATHEDRAL

375
00:21:18,845 --> 00:21:22,749
CEILINGS WILL COME DOWN TO ABOUT

376
00:21:22,749 --> 00:21:29,389
6 FEET.

377
00:21:22,749 --> 00:21:29,389
>> YOU'RE 6'1."

378
00:21:22,749 --> 00:21:29,389
>> I'LL CROUCH.

379
00:21:29,389 --> 00:21:33,093
>> BUT DON'T WORRY, BEA, WE MADE

380
00:21:29,389 --> 00:21:33,093
SURE THERE WAS ENOUGH WALL SPACE

381
00:21:29,389 --> 00:21:33,093
FOR ALL THE OLD BLACK AND WHITE

382
00:21:33,093 --> 00:21:38,331
PHOTOGRAPHS OF YOUR

383
00:21:33,093 --> 00:21:38,331
STERN-LOOKING ANCESTORS.

384
00:21:33,093 --> 00:21:38,331
>> THAT WAS WHEN MEN WERE MEN.

385
00:21:38,331 --> 00:21:44,104
>> AND NOW, DRUMROLL PLEASE.

386
00:21:38,331 --> 00:21:44,104
FOR THE PRIMARY BATHROOM,

387
00:21:38,331 --> 00:21:44,104
LILLIAN WANTED WINDOWS TO TAKE

388
00:21:44,104 --> 00:21:49,876
ADVANTAGE OF YOUR BEAUTIFUL

389
00:21:44,104 --> 00:21:49,876
VIEW.

390
00:21:44,104 --> 00:21:49,876
BUT BEA WAS VERY CONCERNED WITH

391
00:21:49,876 --> 00:21:56,216
PEEPERS INVADING HER PRIVACY,

392
00:21:49,876 --> 00:21:56,216
WHICH TOOK THE BATHROOM WINDOW

393
00:21:49,876 --> 00:21:56,216
COUNT, DOWN FROM SIX TO NO

394
00:21:56,216 --> 00:21:59,886
WINDOWS.

395
00:21:56,216 --> 00:21:59,886
>> YOU KNOW THEM PERVERTS AND

396
00:21:56,216 --> 00:21:59,886
TUGGERS WANT TO SEE MY MAKE MY

397
00:21:59,886 --> 00:22:03,556
DIRT.

398
00:21:59,886 --> 00:22:03,556
>> NO ONE WANTS TO SEE YOU "MAKE

399
00:21:59,886 --> 00:22:03,556
YOUR DIRT."

400
00:22:03,556 --> 00:22:08,862
>> HIT HER.

401
00:22:03,556 --> 00:22:08,862
>> MAMA, NO.

402
00:22:03,556 --> 00:22:08,862
>> HIT HER.

403
00:22:08,862 --> 00:22:13,099
>> ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT IT?

404
00:22:08,862 --> 00:22:13,099
>> WHEN WE COME BACK, THE

405
00:22:08,862 --> 00:22:13,099
UPSTAIRS DEMO BEGINS.

406
00:22:13,099 --> 00:22:20,573
UPSTAIRS DEMO BEGINS.

407
00:22:13,099 --> 00:22:20,573
>> TWO, ONE --

408
00:22:13,099 --> 00:22:20,573
>> OW.

409
00:22:27,514 --> 00:22:33,420
YOU'RE ENJOYING THE MUSIC AND

410
00:22:27,514 --> 00:22:33,420
DINNER.

411
00:22:27,514 --> 00:22:33,420
IF ANYONE DROVE HERE IN A BLUE

412
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:40,827
TOYOTA COROLLA, I JUST WANT TO

413
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:40,827
SAY, I HAVE THE SAME CAR.

414
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:40,827
SO LET'S TALK.

415
00:22:40,827 --> 00:22:48,168
AND NOW, WITHOUT FURTHER ADO,

416
00:22:40,827 --> 00:22:48,168
OUR BIGGEST ACT OF THE NIGHT,

417
00:22:40,827 --> 00:22:48,168
THE SINGERS FOUR.

418
00:22:48,168 --> 00:22:56,176
TONIGHT IS A SPECIAL REUNION.

419
00:22:48,168 --> 00:22:56,176
THEY HAVEN'T PERFORMED TOGETHER

420
00:22:48,168 --> 00:22:56,176
IN 5 YEARS, BUT WE ARE SO LUCKY

421
00:22:56,176 --> 00:23:01,247
THAT THEY ARE ALL BACK IN TOWN

422
00:22:56,176 --> 00:23:01,247
TONIGHT.

423
00:22:56,176 --> 00:23:01,247
PLEASE WELCOME THE SINGERS FOUR!

424

**

425
00:23:01,247 --> 00:23:07,520
>> HELLO, EVERYBODY.

426
00:23:01,247 --> 00:23:07,520
I SEE SOME BEAUTIFUL WATERS AND

427
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:12,392
BREADS IN THE CROWD.

428
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:12,392
>> WE ARE THE SINGERS FOUR.

429
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:12,392
WE'RE SO GLAD TO BE WITH YOU

430
00:23:12,392 --> 00:23:20,533
TONIGHT.

431
00:23:12,392 --> 00:23:20,533
>> YOU KNOW, SO MANY SONGS ARE

432
00:23:12,392 --> 00:23:20,533
DEDICATED TO GREATNESS.

433
00:23:20,533 --> 00:23:25,238
BUT WE HAVE LIVED LONG ENOUGH TO

434
00:23:20,533 --> 00:23:25,238
KNOW THAT NOT EVERYONE CAN BE

435
00:23:20,533 --> 00:23:25,238
GREAT.

436
00:23:25,238 --> 00:23:27,073
SOME OF US ARE JUST WALKING

437
00:23:25,238 --> 00:23:27,073
AROUND.

438
00:23:25,238 --> 00:23:27,073
>> THIS SONG GOES OUT TO THE

439
00:23:27,073 --> 00:23:29,709
FOLKS IN THE MIDDLE, CELEBRATING

440
00:23:27,073 --> 00:23:29,709
THE LITTLE THINGS.

441
00:23:27,073 --> 00:23:29,709
>> BECAUSE IT'S WHAT WE'VE GOT.

442
00:23:29,709 --> 00:23:39,452
IT'S ALL WE WANT.

443
00:23:29,709 --> 00:23:39,452
AND IT'S ACTUALLY A LOT.

444
00:23:29,709 --> 00:23:39,452
** I DON'T HAVE TASTE

445
00:23:39,452 --> 00:23:42,088
** I DON'T HAVE PLANS.

446
00:23:39,452 --> 00:23:42,088
I'VE BEEN PASSED OVER

447
00:23:39,452 --> 00:23:42,088
I'VE BEEN PICKED LAST *

448
00:23:42,088 --> 00:23:46,393
* I'M NOT WINNING ANY MEDALS

449
00:23:42,088 --> 00:23:46,393
NOT NUMBER ONE

450
00:23:42,088 --> 00:23:46,393
TWO OR THREE *

451
00:23:46,393 --> 00:23:49,229
>> WHO THE HELL'S COUNTING?

452
00:23:46,393 --> 00:23:49,229
* BUT I'VE MADE MY BED

453
00:23:46,393 --> 00:23:49,229
EVERY DAY THIS MONTH

454
00:23:49,229 --> 00:23:52,098
I CAN PARALLEL PARK

455
00:23:49,229 --> 00:23:52,098
UNDER ANY CONDITION *

456
00:23:49,229 --> 00:23:52,098
* WHEN I PUMP INSIDE OF

457
00:23:52,098 --> 00:24:03,143
A LADY STUFF COMES OUT *

458
00:23:52,098 --> 00:24:03,143
* AND THAT'S MY DAY FOR ME *

459
00:23:52,098 --> 00:24:03,143
>> LOOK, NO ONE CAN CLIMB

460
00:24:03,143 --> 00:24:04,844
EVEREST.

461
00:24:03,143 --> 00:24:04,844
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT I JUST DID?

462
00:24:03,143 --> 00:24:04,844
>> WELL, TELL US, JOHNNY.

463
00:24:04,844 --> 00:24:06,880
>> I FINISHED AN ENTIRE

464
00:24:04,844 --> 00:24:06,880
CHAPSTICK WITHOUT LOSING IT.

465
00:24:04,844 --> 00:24:06,880
>> I'VE NEVER DONE THAT.

466
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:12,452

GOOD DAD.

469

I'M NOT THE BEST

473
00:24:15,088 --> 00:24:20,360
MIGHT NOT BE SPECIAL

474
00:24:15,088 --> 00:24:20,360
MIGHT NOT BE BLESSED *

475
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:27,901

00:24:27,901 --> 00:24:32,672
REMEMBER.

481
00:24:32,672 --> 00:24:34,140

489
00:24:44,384 --> 00:24:47,087
PRIZE, BUT I CAN SAY THAT I MET

490

ERIC MEESE.

491
00:24:47,087 --> 00:24:51,758

AND WHO IS THAT?

493
00:24:51,758 --> 00:24:59,265

OF "THE REAL WORLD."

495

NOT THE BEST AT SEX.

500
00:25:02,635 --> 00:25:07,941
>> OKAY.

501
00:25:02,635 --> 00:25:07,941

ANYTHING NEW, BUT I GUARANTEE

504
00:25:07,941 --> 00:25:09,709
ONE THING.

505
00:25:09,709 --> 00:25:13,680
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO FEEL SCARED

506
00:25:09,709 --> 00:25:13,680
OR UPSET.

507
00:25:09,709 --> 00:25:13,680
>> OH, YOU GO, GIRL!

508
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:17,917

CLASSICALLY HANDSOME.

510

WAS COOL.

516

GO TO THE MOVIES.

519
00:25:26,826 --> 00:25:31,064
THEN I GO HOME AND MY WIFE SAYS,

HOW WAS WORK?

521
00:25:31,064 --> 00:25:39,472

00:25:31,064 --> 00:25:39,472
AND NOBODY KNOWS.

523
00:25:39,472 --> 00:25:41,775

00:28:56,603 --> 00:29:02,375
>> I'LL GET YOU, EVERYBODY.

638
00:28:56,603 --> 00:29:02,375
UNH!

639
00:28:56,603 --> 00:29:02,375
>> OH, IT KIND OF TICKLES.

640
00:29:02,375 --> 00:29:05,745
>> DON'T TALK, I'M CLOSE.

641
00:29:02,375 --> 00:29:05,745
>> OKAY.

642
00:29:02,375 --> 00:29:05,745
>> WHAT DO YOU DO WITH ALL THIS

643
00:29:05,745 --> 00:29:10,383
POLLEN ANYWAY?

644
00:29:05,745 --> 00:29:10,383
>> I BASICALLY SQUEEZE A LOAD OF

645
00:29:05,745 --> 00:29:10,383
GOOP OUT MY BUTT, AND THEN

646
00:29:10,383 --> 00:29:17,090
PEOPLE EAT IT.

647
00:29:10,383 --> 00:29:17,090
PRETTY KINKY, RIGHT?

648
00:29:10,383 --> 00:29:17,090
>> HEY!

649
00:29:17,090 --> 00:29:21,828
GET OUT OF THERE, YOU SILLY BEE.

650
00:29:17,090 --> 00:29:21,828
DON'T BE BOTHERING MY PRETTY

651
00:29:17,090 --> 00:29:21,828
FLOWERS.

652
00:29:21,828 --> 00:29:25,498
>> OH, THANK GOODNESS THAT'S

653
00:29:21,828 --> 00:29:25,498
OVER.

654
00:29:21,828 --> 00:29:25,498
>> YEAH, PRETTY HARROWING,

655
00:29:25,498 --> 00:29:31,571
RIGHT?

656
00:29:25,498 --> 00:29:31,571
>> WAIT, WHO ARE YOU?

657
00:29:25,498 --> 00:29:31,571
>> JUST ANOTHER FLOWER, LIKE YOU

658
00:29:31,571 --> 00:29:33,940
GUYS.

659
00:29:31,571 --> 00:29:33,940
>> ARE YOU SURE YOU'RE NOT A

660
00:29:31,571 --> 00:29:33,940
WEED?

661
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:41,047
>> NO, I'M A FLOWER.

662
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:41,047
HEY, CAN I CHOKE YOU A LITTLE

663
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:41,047
BIT?

664
00:29:41,047 --> 00:29:42,782
>> CHOKE ME?

665
00:29:41,047 --> 00:29:42,782
NO!

666
00:29:41,047 --> 00:29:42,782
>> OKAY.

667
00:29:42,782 --> 00:29:45,285
WHY NOT, THOUGH?

668
00:29:42,782 --> 00:29:45,285
I THINK YOU MIGHT LIKE IT.

669
00:29:42,782 --> 00:29:45,285
>> HEY, GET AWAY FROM US,

670
00:29:45,285 --> 00:29:47,921
WEIRDO, YOU'RE NOT A FLOWER AND

671
00:29:45,285 --> 00:29:47,921
YOU DON'T BELONG HERE.

672
00:29:45,285 --> 00:29:47,921
>> OH, YOU DON'T THINK I BELONG

673
00:29:47,921 --> 00:29:53,727
HERE?

674
00:29:47,921 --> 00:29:53,727
YOU DON'T WANT ME IN YOUR LITTLE

675
00:29:47,921 --> 00:29:53,727
GATED FLOWER COMMUNITY?

676
00:29:53,727 --> 00:29:56,863
HEY, ARE YOU HEARING THIS, BULB?

677
00:29:53,727 --> 00:29:56,863
>> UH-HUH.

678
00:29:53,727 --> 00:29:56,863
>> COME ON, JUST LET ME CHOKE

679
00:29:56,863 --> 00:30:02,635
YOU!

680
00:29:56,863 --> 00:30:02,635
>> STOP.

681
00:29:56,863 --> 00:30:02,635
CAN YOU BELIEVE THIS?

682
00:30:02,635 --> 00:30:07,374
>> I KNOW, IT'S LIKE, WHEN IS IT

683
00:30:02,635 --> 00:30:07,374
GOING TO BE MY TURN?

684
00:30:02,635 --> 00:30:07,374
>> HEY!

685
00:30:07,374 --> 00:30:11,044
GO AWAY, YOU STUPID WEED!

686
00:30:07,374 --> 00:30:11,044
GET BACK!

687
00:30:07,374 --> 00:30:11,044
>> ARGGHH!

688
00:30:11,044 --> 00:30:17,350
YOU CAN KILL ME BUT YOU CAN'T

689
00:30:11,044 --> 00:30:17,350
KILL THE REVOLUTION!

690
00:30:11,044 --> 00:30:17,350
>> WOW.

691
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:26,359
A LOT HAPPENS IN THIS GARDEN

692
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:26,359
BED.

693
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:26,359
>> AT LEAST THE DAY HASN'T BEEN

694
00:30:26,359 --> 00:30:32,465
ALL BAD.

695
00:30:26,359 --> 00:30:32,465
WE'RE ALTOGETHER, AND THERE IS

696
00:30:26,359 --> 00:30:32,465
NOT A CLOUD IN THE SKY.

697
00:30:32,465 --> 00:30:35,101
>> WAIT.

698
00:30:32,465 --> 00:30:35,101
THERE IS A CLOUD.

699
00:30:32,465 --> 00:30:35,101
>> AND WHY IS THE CLOUD SO

700
00:30:35,101 --> 00:30:37,737
FURRY?

701
00:30:35,101 --> 00:30:37,737
>> AND WHY DOES HE HAVE -- THE

702
00:30:35,101 --> 00:30:37,737
CLOUD HAVE A PENIS?

703
00:30:37,737 --> 00:30:39,839
>> MR. PEANUT, DON'T DO THAT TO

704
00:30:37,737 --> 00:30:39,839
MY FLOWERS.

705
00:30:37,737 --> 00:30:39,839
>> OH!

706
00:30:39,839 --> 00:30:41,207
MY FLOWERS.

707
00:30:39,839 --> 00:30:41,207
>> OH!

708
00:30:39,839 --> 00:30:41,207
>> OH!

709
00:30:45,111 --> 00:30:52,118
>> WHAT IS THIS HOT LIQUID?

710
00:30:45,111 --> 00:30:52,118
>> AH!

711
00:30:45,111 --> 00:30:52,118
SO SALTY!

712
00:30:52,118 --> 00:30:55,288
>> I DON'T MIND IT.

713
00:30:52,118 --> 00:30:55,288
>> I'M GETTING OUT OF HERE.

714
00:30:52,118 --> 00:30:55,288
OH, MY GOD!

715
00:30:55,288 --> 00:31:03,063
I DON'T HAVE LEGS!

716
00:30:55,288 --> 00:31:03,063
WHERE ARE MY LEGS?

717
00:30:55,288 --> 00:31:03,063
>> OW!

718
00:31:03,063 --> 00:31:06,766
MAKE IT STOP!

719
00:31:03,063 --> 00:31:06,766
>> IT'S TO HARD!

720
00:31:03,063 --> 00:31:06,766
OW!

721
00:31:06,766 --> 00:31:08,368
THIS DOG IS DEHYDRATED!

722
00:31:06,766 --> 00:31:08,368
OW!

723
00:31:06,766 --> 00:31:08,368
>> AHH!

724
00:31:08,368 --> 00:31:12,072
WHEN IS IT GOING TO BE MY TURN?

725
00:31:08,368 --> 00:31:12,072
>> GET OUT OF THERE, MR. PEANUT.

726
00:31:08,368 --> 00:31:12,072
OH, MY POOR FLOWERS ARE SOAKED.

727
00:31:12,072 --> 00:31:18,378
>> WOW.

728
00:31:12,072 --> 00:31:18,378
I GUESS BEING A FLOWER MAYBE

729
00:31:12,072 --> 00:31:18,378
ISN'T ALL IT'S CRACKED UP TO BE.

730
00:31:18,378 --> 00:31:23,116
>> DON'T SAY THAT!

731
00:31:18,378 --> 00:31:23,116
DON'T YOU EVER!

732
00:31:18,378 --> 00:31:23,116
IT'S BEEN A LONG, GRAY WINTER

733
00:31:23,116 --> 00:31:27,854
AND PEOPLE NEED US.

734
00:31:23,116 --> 00:31:27,854
OUR BEAUTIFUL COLORS AND OUR

735
00:31:23,116 --> 00:31:27,854
SWEET AROMAS.

736
00:31:27,854 --> 00:31:33,093
EVEN IF RIGHT NOW WE DON'T

737
00:31:27,854 --> 00:31:33,093
EXACTLY SMELL SO GOOD.

738
00:31:33,093 --> 00:31:37,297
>> YOU'RE RIGHT.

739
00:31:33,093 --> 00:31:37,297
LOOK AT THE SMILE ON

740
00:31:33,093 --> 00:31:37,297
MR. GREEN THUMB'S FACE RIGHT

741
00:31:37,297 --> 00:31:45,205
NOW.

742
00:31:37,297 --> 00:31:45,205
>> ALL RIGHT, LET'S SEE WHICH

743
00:31:37,297 --> 00:31:45,205
ONE OF Y'ALL ARE GOING TO LOOK

744
00:31:45,205 --> 00:31:49,409
GOOD ON THE BACK OF MY COLLAR.

745
00:31:45,205 --> 00:31:49,409
>> OH, OH!

746
00:31:45,205 --> 00:31:49,409
AGHH!

747
00:31:49,409 --> 00:31:56,816
AGHH!

748
00:31:49,409 --> 00:31:56,816
>> NO!

749
00:31:49,409 --> 00:31:56,816
>> OH, NO!

750
00:31:56,816 --> 00:32:06,793
THEY KILLED JAKE FLOWER-HAAL!

751
00:31:56,816 --> 00:32:06,793
>> IS THAT WHO THAT WAS?

752
00:31:56,816 --> 00:32:06,793
>> THIS GUY IS CRAZY.

753
00:32:06,793 --> 00:32:12,532
>> THIS GUY IS CRAZY.

754
00:32:06,793 --> 00:32:12,532
CAN I CHOKE YOU A LITTLE BIT?

755
00:32:06,793 --> 00:32:12,532
>> FINALLY.

756
00:32:18,226 --> 00:32:21,206
THESE MEETINGS TONIGHT HAVE BEEN
BRUTAL.

757
00:32:21,277 --> 00:32:23,213
>> I KNOW.
I CAN BARELY KEEP MY EYES OPEN.

758
00:32:23,213 --> 00:32:24,815
>> YOU GUYS, I AM SO DONE WITH
JANET.

759
00:32:24,815 --> 00:32:27,174
>> OKAY, SHE IS AWFUL.
>> I KNOW.

760
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:29,407
>> SHE'S ALWAYS RUNNING DOWN THE
HALLWAY SO FAST.

761
00:32:29,407 --> 00:32:32,999
IT'S LIKE WHAT'S THE BIG RUSH,
JANET?
YOU DON'T ACTUALLY DO ANYTHING.

762
00:32:32,999 --> 00:32:37,810
>> I KNOW.
AND DOES SHE HAVE TO EAT TUNA
EVERY DAY?
>> MAKES ME SICK.

763
00:32:37,810 --> 00:32:40,607
AND SHE CHEWS WITH HER MOUTH
OPEN LIKE A FARM ANIMAL.
>> YES.

764
00:32:40,701 --> 00:32:43,985
>> OKAY, THE WORST IS WHEN SHE'S
QUIET.
IT'S SO CREEPY.

765
00:32:43,985 --> 00:32:45,951
SERIOUSLY.
LIKE YESTERDAY WHEN WE WERE CAR
POOLING,

766
00:32:45,951 --> 00:32:50,266
I COMPLETELY FORGOT SHE WAS IN
THE CAR BECAUSE SHE DIDN'T SAY A
WORD THE WHOLE TIME.

767
00:32:50,266 --> 00:32:54,408
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN SHE JUST
POPS UP IN THE BACK SEAT OUT OF
NOWHERE LIKE CHUCKY.

768
00:33:15,514 --> 00:33:17,805
>> HEY, CHUCKY.

769
00:33:18,124 --> 00:33:22,822
>> WE DIDN'T REALIZE YOU WERE IN
THERE.
>> WELL, I WAS.

770
00:33:22,822 --> 00:33:27,793
>> DID YOU HEAR US TALKING?
>> NO, NOT REALLY.

771
00:33:27,793 --> 00:33:32,250
ONLY THE PART WHERE YOU COMPARED
ME TO JANET, YOU FILTHY SLUTS!

772
00:33:32,250 --> 00:33:35,934
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO MESS WITH
ME!

773
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,391
NO

774
00:33:43,826 --> 00:33:46,897
>> NOW, I KNOW NO ONE LIKES
GETTING CALLED INTO AN HR MEETING,

775
00:33:46,897 --> 00:33:50,205
BUT GIVEN WHAT HAPPENED
THIS MORNING, I FELT IT WAS
NECESSARY.

776
00:33:50,205 --> 00:33:53,181
CHUCKY, AS YOU KNOW, WE HAVE A
COMPANY POLICY

777
00:33:53,181 --> 00:33:56,228
AGAINST STABBING
YOUR COWORKERS IN THE LEGS WITH
A KNIFE.

778
00:33:56,228 --> 00:34:00,647
BUT LADIES, WE ALSO HAVE A
ZERO-TOLERANCE POLICY WHEN IT
COMES TO BULLYING.

779
00:34:00,647 --> 00:34:03,338
WHAT YOU SAID ABOUT CHUCKY WAS
UNCALLED FOR.

780
00:34:03,338 --> 00:34:05,882
ESPECIALLY COMPARING HIM TO
JANET.

781
00:34:05,882 --> 00:34:08,754
WHO WE ALL KNOW SUCKS.

782
00:34:08,754 --> 00:34:11,754
>> I'M SORRY, WHY DO I HAVE TO
BE HERE?

783
00:34:11,789 --> 00:34:15,266
>> TO TAKE NOTES, JANET.

784
00:34:16,310 --> 00:34:20,411
>> OKAY, SO HOW CAN WE STOP THIS
KIND OF THING FROM HAPPENING IN
THE FUTURE?

785
00:34:20,411 --> 00:34:23,453
>> BY PUTTING THESE BITCHES IN
BODY BAGS?

786
00:34:23,453 --> 00:34:26,943
>> SEE, THAT'S IT RIGHT THERE.
- CHUCKY'S ALWAYS SAYING THINGS
LIKE THAT.

787
00:34:26,943 --> 00:34:31,102
>> I ALSO THINK THESE
GENDER-NEUTRAL BATHROOMS WERE A
BIG MISTAKE.
>> UH-OH.

788
00:34:31,102 --> 00:34:34,512
>> ONLY BECAUSE NOW I HAVE TO
WORRY ABOUT CHUCKY DROPPING DOWN
FROM THE CEILING

789
00:34:34,512 --> 00:34:36,686
AND LANDING ON
MY BACK WHILE I'M SITTING ON THE
TOILET.

790
00:34:36,686 --> 00:34:40,049
>> DON'T TEMPT ME WITH A GOOD
TIME.
>> EW, CHUCKY, STOP.

791
00:34:40,049 --> 00:34:43,566
>> CHUCKY, I UNDERSTAND THAT
WHEN YOUR FEELINGS GET HURT,
YOUR FIRST INSTINCT IS VIOLENCE.

792
00:34:43,566 --> 00:34:46,837
FOR EXAMPLE, YOU'RE STABBING ME
IN THE LEG RIGHT NOW.

793
00:34:46,837 --> 00:34:47,890
>> OH, MY GOD.

794
00:34:47,890 --> 00:34:51,795
>> YOU SEE, HE DOESN'T BELONG
HERE.
>> YES, HE DOES.

795
00:34:51,795 --> 00:34:54,630
EACH OF US HAS A DIFFERENT
STORY.

796
00:34:54,630 --> 00:34:57,296
MEGAN, YOU HAVE A BACKGROUND IN
PR.

797
00:34:57,296 --> 00:35:00,100

00:54:34,074 --> 00:54:45,952

1316
00:54:45,952 --> 00:54:49,656

00:54:49,656 --> 00:54:54,361
OH, REALLY?

1318
00:54:49,656 --> 00:54:54,361
YOU'RE GOING TO SHOOT ME?

1319
00:54:49,656 --> 00:54:54,361

1320
00:54:54,361 --> 00:55:01,768

1322
00:54:54,361 --> 00:55:01,768
ABOUT COMMUNICATION.

1323
00:55:01,768 --> 00:55:06,039
>> I -- I'M SORRY, DID SOMEBODY

1324
00:55:01,768 --> 00:55:06,039
JUST THREATEN TO SHOOT YOU?

1325
00:55:01,768 --> 00:55:06,039
>> NO, NO.

1326
00:55:06,039 --> 00:55:08,274
SHE DOESN'T EVEN KNOW WHERE I

1327
00:55:06,039 --> 00:55:08,274
WORK.

1328
00:55:06,039 --> 00:55:08,274
TED, HAVE YOU ALWAYS BEEN AFRAID

1329
00:55:08,274 --> 00:55:15,482

1330
00:55:08,274 --> 00:55:15,482
>> UH -- WELL -- I WOULDN'T PUT

00:55:15,482 --> 00:55:18,485
I MEAN, I --

1333
00:55:15,482 --> 00:55:18,485
DO YOU NEED TO GET THAT?

1334
00:55:18,485 --> 00:55:21,054
>> NO.

1335
00:55:18,485 --> 00:55:21,054
THIS IS YOUR TIME, TED.

1336
00:55:18,485 --> 00:55:21,054
CONTINUE.

1337
00:55:21,054 --> 00:55:22,589
>> I MEAN, I DON'T LOVE

1338
00:55:21,054 --> 00:55:22,589
CONFLICT.

1339
00:55:22,589 --> 00:55:25,225
MY FATHER WAS AN ANGRY GUY,

1340
00:55:22,589 --> 00:55:25,225
ESPECIALLY WHEN HE WAS

1341
00:55:22,589 --> 00:55:25,225
DRINKING --

1342
00:55:25,225 --> 00:55:30,497
>> ACTUALLY, I DO HAVE TO TAKE

1343
00:55:25,225 --> 00:55:30,497
THIS.

1344
00:55:30,497 --> 00:55:39,939
HOLD THAT THOUGHT BECAUSE ANGER

1345
00:55:30,497 --> 00:55:39,939
IS NEVER THE ANSWER.

1346
00:55:30,497 --> 00:55:39,939
YEAH, HO, WHERE YOU AT?

1347
00:55:39,939 --> 00:55:48,148
OKAY, BECAUSE I'M AT 453 UNION

1348
00:55:39,939 --> 00:55:48,148

1349
00:55:39,939 --> 00:55:48,148
AND THERE'S THREE OF US

1350
00:55:48,148 --> 00:55:52,252
IN HERE AND WE ALL STRAPPED.

1351
00:55:48,148 --> 00:55:52,252
OKAY.

1352
00:55:48,148 --> 00:55:52,252
NOW WHERE WERE WE?

1353
00:55:52,252 --> 00:55:54,888
>> WHAT'S STRAPPED?

1354
00:55:52,252 --> 00:55:54,888
ARE WE STRAPPED?

1355
00:55:52,252 --> 00:55:54,888
>> NO, WE ARE NOT.

1356
00:55:54,888 --> 00:55:59,325
SHOULD WE LEAVE?

1357
00:55:54,888 --> 00:55:59,325
>> ABSOLUTELY NOT.

1358
00:55:54,888 --> 00:55:59,325
AS A MATTER OF FACT, THIS IS THE

1359
00:55:59,325 --> 00:56:06,466
PERFECT OPPORTUNITY OF

1360
