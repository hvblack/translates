1
00:00:00,614 --> 00:00:04,359
>>> EASTER, THE CELEBRATION OF
THE REBIRTH OF CHRIST.

2
00:00:04,359 --> 00:00:08,304
THE BIBLE TELLS US THAT THREE
DAYS AFTER THE CRUCIFIXION OF JESUS,

3
00:00:08,304 --> 00:00:09,889
HE ROSE FROM THE DEAD.

4
00:00:09,889 --> 00:00:12,856
THE FIRST TO WITNESS THIS
MIRACLE WERE THREE WOMEN

5
00:00:12,856 --> 00:00:16,801
WHO HAD
COME TO ANOINT THE BODY OF JESUS
AND TEND TO HIS TOMB.

6
00:00:16,801 --> 00:00:21,498
THIS IS THE STORY OF THE
RESURRECTION.

7
00:00:31,144 --> 00:00:35,164
>>> THIS IS IT, THE TOMB WHERE
HIS BODY IS LAID.

8
00:00:35,164 --> 00:00:37,028
>> MOTHER MARY, DRY YOUR TEARS.

9
00:00:37,028 --> 00:00:39,442
MARY AND I ARE HERE TO SUPPORT
YOU.

10
00:00:39,442 --> 00:00:42,932
>> MARY IS RIGHT.
ALSO, WHEN WE'RE DONE GRIEVING,

11
00:00:42,932 --> 00:00:47,198
MAYBE WE SHOULD COME UP WITH A
GIRL'S NAME OTHER THAN MARY.

12
00:00:48,234 --> 00:00:51,150
>> WHAT IS THAT NOISE THAT COMES
FROM WITHIN?

13
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:54,234
>> LOOK, THE STONE, IT ROLLS
AWAY.

14
00:00:54,234 --> 00:00:56,462
>> IS IT JESUS?

15
00:00:56,939 --> 00:00:59,556
>> BASICALLY, YES.

16
00:01:04,416 --> 00:01:06,627
HAPPY EASTER, EVERYBODY.

17
00:01:06,627 --> 00:01:09,625
AS IT WAS STATED IN THE BIBLE,
GUESS WHO'S BACK,

18
00:01:09,625 --> 00:01:12,283
BACK AGAIN,
SHADY'S BACK.

19
00:01:12,516 --> 00:01:14,312
ALL RIGHT, GIRLS.
YOU CAN GO.

20
00:01:14,312 --> 00:01:16,245
NO MORE LINES.
YOU DID GREAT.

21
00:01:16,245 --> 00:01:18,074
BYE BYE.

22
00:01:18,727 --> 00:01:21,028
GET OUT OF HERE.

23
00:01:21,028 --> 00:01:22,886
THAT'S RIGHT. IT'S EASTER,

24
00:01:22,886 --> 00:01:26,790
THE TIME OF YEAR
WHEN I COMPARE MYSELF TO JESUS
CHRIST.

25
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:28,380
THAT'S JUST A THING I DO NOW,

26
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:31,358
AND PEOPLE SEEM TO BE OKAY WITH
IT.
I'M GOING TO KEEP DOING IT.

27
00:01:31,358 --> 00:01:33,496
IF YOU THINK THIS IS A BAD LOOK,

28
00:01:33,496 --> 00:01:36,803
IMAGINE HOW WEIRD IT WOULD BE IF
I STARTED SELLING BIBLES.

29
00:01:36,803 --> 00:01:41,015
WELL, I'M SELLING BIBLES.

30
00:01:41,015 --> 00:01:46,445
LOOK AT THIS BEAUTIFUL BIBLE
MADE FROM 100% BIBLE.

31
00:01:46,445 --> 00:01:51,005
SOUNDS LIKE A JOKE, AND IN MANY
WAYS IT IS, BUT IT'S ALSO VERY
REAL.

32
00:01:51,005 --> 00:01:55,242
AS YOU KNOW, I LOVE BIBLE.
IT'S MY FAVORITE BOOK.

33
00:01:55,242 --> 00:01:57,331
I'VE DEFINITELY READ IT.

34
00:01:57,331 --> 00:02:00,529
MY FAVORITE PART IS PROBABLY THE ENDING,

35
00:02:00,529 --> 00:02:02,905
HOW IT ALL WRAPS UP.

36
00:02:02,905 --> 00:02:05,476
BUT THIS IS A VERY SPECIAL
BIBLE.

37
00:02:05,476 --> 00:02:09,439
AND IT CAN BE YOURS FOR THE
HIGH, HIGH PRICE OF $60.

38
00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:12,143
BUT I'M NOT DOING THIS FOR THE
MONEY.

39
00:02:12,143 --> 00:02:15,681
I'M DOING THIS FOR THE GLORY OF GOD

40
00:02:15,681 --> 00:02:19,790
AND FOR PANDERING AND MOSTLY
FOR MONEY.

41
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:25,320
BUT IT'S SO SAD.
RELIGION AND CHRISTIANITY ARE
TOTALLY GONE FROM THIS COUNTRY,

42
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,438
AND WE NEED THEM BACK.

43
00:02:26,438 --> 00:02:30,664
WITHOUT RELIGION, YOU DON'T HAVE
LAWS, YOU DON'T HAVE MISSION
TRIPS.

44
00:02:30,664 --> 00:02:32,767
I'M TOLD MISSION TRIPS ARE A LOT
OF FUN.

45
00:02:32,767 --> 00:02:34,281
YOU GO TO MEXICO, BUILD A HOUSE,

46
00:02:34,281 --> 00:02:37,199
MAYBE MAKE OUT WITH SOMEONE ON
THE LAST NIGHT.

47
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:41,582
THEN IT'S BACK TO CLEAR WATER,
FLORIDA LIKE IT NEVER HAPPENED.

48
00:02:41,582 --> 00:02:46,788
BUT YOU'RE GOING TO LOVE MY NEW
AND EVEN BETTER BIBLE.

49
00:02:46,788 --> 00:02:49,253
IT COMES WITH EVERYTHING YOU
LIKE FROM BIBLE,

50
00:02:49,253 --> 00:02:51,828
LIKE THE STORY OF EASTER,

51
00:02:51,828 --> 00:02:55,402
WHICH PRIMARILY
CONCERNS JESUS, NOT SO MUCH THE
BUNNY.

52
00:02:55,402 --> 00:02:57,949
CAN'T WAIT
THE BUNNY NEVER SHOWED UP.

53
00:02:57,949 --> 00:02:59,279
THAT'S OKAY.

54
00:02:59,279 --> 00:03:03,787
NOW, MY BIBLE ALSO INCLUDES SOME
BEAUTIFUL ILLUSTRATIONS

55
00:03:03,787 --> 00:03:06,962
LIKE
MOSES FLOATING DOWN THE RIVER IN
THE BASKET,

56
00:03:06,962 --> 00:03:10,584
AND UH-OH, LOOK OUT,
HERE'S TRUMP IN THE BASKET.

57
00:03:10,584 --> 00:03:13,812
RIGHT BEHIND MOSES ABOUT TO PASS
ON THE LEFT.

58
00:03:13,812 --> 00:03:20,106
AND HERE I AM IN THE GARDEN OF
EDEN WITH MY ACTUAL BODY.

59
00:03:20,106 --> 00:03:23,487
YOU KNOW, I THINK I WOULD BE
VERY GOOD AT SAYING NO TO THE SNAKE

60
00:03:23,487 --> 00:03:26,986
FROM THE STANDPOINT OF NOT
LIKING FRUIT.

61
00:03:26,986 --> 00:03:32,326
AND HERE'S NOAH'S ARK, ALL THE
ANIMALS ARE ON THE ARK OF
COURSE.

62
00:03:32,326 --> 00:03:37,111
THERE'S ME YELLING AT NOAH, HEY,
BUDDY, YOU FORGOT THE RACCOON.

63
00:03:37,177 --> 00:03:40,793
BUT WE LOVE RELIGION, AND WE
LOVE GOD.

64
00:03:40,793 --> 00:03:43,941
HE'S PROBABLY THE BEST PART OF
THE HOLY TRINITY.

65
00:03:43,941 --> 00:03:47,334
HE'S LIKE THE BEYONCE.
COWBOY CARTER.

66
00:03:48,685 --> 00:03:53,335
GOD'S THE BEYONCE, JESUS IS THE
KELLY ROWLAND,

67
00:03:53,335 --> 00:03:56,994
AND HOLY GHOST
WOULD PROBABLY BE THE BLACK MICHELLE WILLIAMS

68
00:03:56,994 --> 00:03:59,570
WHO'S VERY
IMPORTANT TO A GREAT NUMBER OF
PEOPLE.

69
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:05,384
ALMOST AS IMPORTANT AS THE WHITE
MICHELLE WILLIAMS IS TO WHITE
PEOPLE.

70
00:04:05,384 --> 00:04:08,315
AND WE BELIEVE THERE WAS A
FOURTH DESTINY CHILD,

71
00:04:08,315 --> 00:04:10,426
BUT WE'LL
BE LOOKING INTO THAT VERY
STRONGLY.

72
00:04:10,426 --> 00:04:12,599
VERY SHORTLY.

73
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:15,724
BILLS, BILLS, BILLS, THAT'S A
GOOD ONE.
I LIKE THAT ONE.

74
00:04:15,724 --> 00:04:19,567
I WOULD LOVE SOMEONE TO PAY
MINE.
ANY TAKERS?

75
00:04:19,567 --> 00:04:20,857
NO.

76
00:04:20,857 --> 00:04:23,022
WELL, BACK TO MY BEAUTIFUL BIBLE,

77
00:04:23,022 --> 00:04:28,686
WHICH ALSO INCLUDES
CONSTITUTION AND PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE,

78
00:04:28,686 --> 00:04:32,392
AND -- I DON'T KNOW,
MAYBE MIRANDA RIGHTS,

79
00:04:32,392 --> 00:04:35,920
WHICH
MEANS UNFORTUNATELY WE HAD TO
MAKE SOME CUTS.

80
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:39,875
THIS BIBLE WILL NOT FEATURE AMOS
OR HABAKKUK.

81
00:04:39,875 --> 00:04:45,281
SORRY, HABAKKUK, BUT NOW I THINK
IT REALLY COOKS.
IT'S TIGHT.

82
00:04:45,281 --> 00:04:50,759
AND IF YOU ORDER NOW, WE'LL ALSO
THROW IN A FREE TRUMP MIRACLE
TOASTER.

83
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:56,156
YOU KNOW HOW SOMETIMES WEIRDOS
SEE A PICTURE OF JESUS OR
SOMETHING IN THEIR TOAST?

84
00:04:56,156 --> 00:04:58,959
WELL, HOW ABOUT THE MIRACLE OF
TRUMP?

85
00:04:58,959 --> 00:05:03,235
AND THIS IS GREAT.
THE OTHER SIDE DOES HELLO KITTY

86
00:05:03,235 --> 00:05:08,740
IF YOU HAVE A DAUGHTER OR
PERHAPS A SON WHO'S TAKING DANCE
CLASSES.

87
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:11,179
ANYWAY, IT'S EASTER EVE,

88
00:05:11,179 --> 00:05:14,349
SO LET US BOW OUR HEADS -- I'M NOT
GOING TO --

89
00:05:14,349 --> 00:05:19,850
AND SAY THE LORD'S
PRAYER, WHICH WE ALL KNOW VERY
WELL, ME ESPECIALLY.

90
00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:23,465
OUR FATHER WHO ARE IN HEAVEN,

91
00:05:23,532 --> 00:05:25,369
HALLOWED

92
00:05:28,452 --> 00:05:31,489
TRESPASS, DAILY BREAD,

93
00:05:31,489 --> 00:05:35,332
AND PLEASE LEAD US INTO
TEMPTATION,

94
00:05:35,332 --> 00:05:38,469
AND PAY OUR
AUTOMOBILES.

95
00:05:38,469 --> 00:05:43,483
IN THE NAME OF FATHER, THE SON,
AND THE EASTER BUNNY, AMEN,

96
00:05:43,483 --> 00:05:47,107
AND
LIVE FROM NEW YORK, IT'S
SATURDAY NIGHT!

97
00:07:53,631 --> 00:07:58,514
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, RAMY
YOUSSEF!

98
00:08:23,094 --> 00:08:28,172
SPIRITUAL WEEKEND

99
00:08:28,172 --> 00:08:30,842
WE'RE IN THE HOLY MONTH OF
RAMADAN.

100
00:08:32,818 --> 00:08:34,896
TOMORROW IS EASTER.

101
00:08:34,896 --> 00:08:38,715
AND YESTERDAY, BEYONCE RELEASED
A NEW ALBUM.

102
00:08:38,715 --> 00:08:44,097
THERE'S JUST SO MANY RELIGIONS
CELEBRATING ALL AT ONCE.

103
00:08:44,097 --> 00:08:46,958
I'M DOING THE RAMADAN ONE.

104
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:51,586
I LOVE RAMADAN BECAUSE I LOVE
HANGING OUT WITH MUSLIMS.
WE'RE SO LOVING.

105
00:08:51,586 --> 00:08:53,730
AND I FEEL LIKE PEOPLE DON'T
KNOW THAT ABOUT US.

106
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:56,981
THEY KNOW ALL THESE OTHER
THINGS, BUT MAN, WE LOVE TO
LOVE.

107
00:08:56,981 --> 00:08:58,572
WE'RE SO FREE WITH IT.

108
00:08:58,637 --> 00:09:02,255
MY FRIENDS THAT I GREW UP WITH,
THEY WERE REALLY WEIRD ABOUT
LOVE.

109
00:09:02,255 --> 00:09:06,411
I HAVE A BUDDY OF MINE WHO WAS
LIKE, MAN, I'VE BEEN HANGING OUT
WITH THIS GIRL, DUDE,

110
00:09:06,411 --> 00:09:11,664
AND I TOLD
HER I LOVED HER.
IT'S ONLY BEEN NINE MONTHS.

111
00:09:11,664 --> 00:09:16,534
I WAS LIKE, DUDE, I JUST SAID
THAT TO MY UBER DRIVER.

112
00:09:16,534 --> 00:09:21,093
I GAVE HIM MY NUMBER.
I WAS LIKE, BRO, LET'S GET OFF
THE APP.

113
00:09:21,093 --> 00:09:25,433
I WANT TO GET TO KNOW YOU.
YOU MEAN SOMETHING TO ME.

114
00:09:25,433 --> 00:09:28,378
NINE MONTHS?
YOU SHOULD HAVE A KID.

115
00:09:28,378 --> 00:09:30,405
IT'S TOO MUCH.

116
00:09:30,405 --> 00:09:33,871
AND PEOPLE DON'T GET US, AND
THERE'S ALL THIS DIVISION, BUT
IT'S NOT WHERE YOU THINK IT IS.

117
00:09:33,871 --> 00:09:35,788
SO I LIVE IN NEW YORK.
WE'RE IN THIS BUBBLE.

118
00:09:35,788 --> 00:09:38,860
WE THINK EVERYTHING WE DISAGREE
WITH IS IN THE SOUTH.

119
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:42,916
BUT I DON'T BELIEVE IN THE
SOUTH.

120
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:44,810
THERE IS NO SOUTH.

121
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:49,533
LIKE, THE SOUTH IS 45 MINUTES
AWAY FROM WHEREVER YOU ARE.

122
00:09:49,889 --> 00:09:52,235
I HAD A SHOW IN UPSTATE NEW
YORK.

123
00:09:52,235 --> 00:09:54,144
I WAS WALKING THROUGH THE
NEIGHBORHOOD.

124
00:09:54,144 --> 00:09:57,891
THERE'S ALL THIS TRUMP STUFF,
FLAGS, RED HATS,

125
00:09:57,891 --> 00:10:01,665
I WAS LIKE, YO,
I WENT NORTH,

126
00:10:01,665 --> 00:10:04,159
BUT I'M SOUTH.

127
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:07,178
AND I COULD FEEL IT, YOU KNOW, I
COULD FEEL THE FEAR.

128
00:10:07,178 --> 00:10:09,656
WHEN MY MOM CALLED ME, I DIDN'T
WANT TO SPEAK ARABIC.

129
00:10:09,657 --> 00:10:11,345
SALAM

130
00:10:11,345 --> 00:10:15,125
I WAS LIKE, MOTHER, PEACE BE
UPON YOU.
LIKE, I --

131
00:10:15,125 --> 00:10:20,557
YOU KNOW, AND THE
PROFIT, YOU KNOW WHICH PROFIT.

132
00:10:20,557 --> 00:10:23,767
THE BEST ONE, THE LAST ONE.

133
00:10:27,802 --> 00:10:30,830
IT'S TOUGH BECAUSE IT'S AN
ELECTION YEAR.

134
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:33,433
THAT'S WHEN YOU CAN FEEL IT.
EVERYONE'S FREAKING OUT.

135
00:10:33,433 --> 00:10:37,972
FOR ME, WHERE I'M AT NOW, I KNOW
BIDEN'S GOING TO CALL.

136
00:10:37,972 --> 00:10:41,544
CALL
HE'LL PROBABLY FORGET.

137
00:10:41,544 --> 00:10:45,017
BUT I THINK SOMEBODY WILL CALL.

138
00:10:45,017 --> 00:10:49,646
LIKE IN 2020, I GOT A CALL FROM
MUHAMMAD AT BIDEN.

139
00:10:49,646 --> 00:10:53,283
YOU KNOW THEY THOUGHT THAT WAS
SO COOL.

140
00:10:53,283 --> 00:10:58,468
LIKE BEN WAS GOING TO CALL, AND
THEY WERE LIKE, NO, NO, LET
MUHAMMAD DO IT.

141
00:10:58,468 --> 00:11:01,979
RAMY'S GOING TO LIKE THAT
ENERGY.

142
00:11:01,979 --> 00:11:04,620
HE GOES, RAMY, WE LOVE YOU.

143
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:08,129
WE LOVE EVERYTHING THAT YOU'VE
DONE FOR ARAB AMERICA.

144
00:11:08,129 --> 00:11:11,050
HE SAID IT LIKE IT WAS A
COUNTRY.

145
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:15,304
HE GOES, EVERYONE ON THE
CAMPAIGN IS SUCH A BIG FAN OF
YOUR WORK.

146
00:11:15,304 --> 00:11:17,833
AND JOE'S AWARE, RIGHT.

147
00:11:17,833 --> 00:11:22,216
THAT'S HUGE, RIGHT, BECAUSE JOE
HAS AN AWARENESS ISSUE.

148
00:11:22,216 --> 00:11:26,587
I MEAN, JOE'S AWARE.
THAT'S LIKE A NOBEL PEACE PRIZE.

149
00:11:26,587 --> 00:11:30,064
WE SAID YOUR NAME, JOE WAS
NODDING.

150
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:33,284
JOE LOOKS GOOD WHEN HE'S AWARE.
YOU'VE SEEN HIM, RIGHT?

151
00:11:33,284 --> 00:11:37,938
YOU KNOW THOSE DAYS WHEN HE
COMES OUT AND HE'S JUST LIKE
THAWED.

152
00:11:38,733 --> 00:11:43,212
THEY GIVE HIM AN EXTRA TEN IN
THE MICROWAVE.
HE'S JUST LIT UP.

153
00:11:43,212 --> 00:11:46,056
HE LOOKS GOOD.
AND HE SAYS STUFF THAT'S
INSPIRING.

154
00:11:46,056 --> 00:11:49,207
IT DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING, BUT
IT'S GOOD.

155
00:11:49,207 --> 00:11:51,895
HE'LL BE LIKE, I RIDE THE TRAIN.

156
00:11:51,895 --> 00:11:54,956
YOU'RE LIKE, SICK, WHERE'S IT
GOING.

157
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:58,693
AND YOU NEVER FIND OUT.

158
00:11:59,138 --> 00:12:03,373
BUT MUHAMMAD GOES TO ME, RAMY,
LISTEN, THIS IS A TOUGH
ELECTION.

159
00:12:03,373 --> 00:12:06,720
THERE'S A LOT OF BATTLEGROUNDS,

160
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:11,327
BUT WE'VE REALIZED IF WE CAN WIN
JUST ONE, WE'LL GET THE WHOLE
COUNTRY.

161
00:12:11,327 --> 00:12:15,693
THE ONLY STATE WE NEED IS
MICHIGAN.

162
00:12:15,693 --> 00:12:18,392
ARAB AMERICA.

163
00:12:18,392 --> 00:12:21,128
HE GOES, RAMY, GO TO MICHIGAN.

164
00:12:21,128 --> 00:12:24,142
TELL THE ARABS TO VOTE FOR JOE,

165
00:12:24,142 --> 00:12:27,335
AND YOU COULD CHANGE THE COURSE
OF AMERICAN HISTORY.

166
00:12:27,335 --> 00:12:30,805
AND OUR COUNTRY'S SO MESSED UP
THAT FOR FIVE MINUTES, I WAS LIKE,

167
00:12:30,805 --> 00:12:33,364
IS THIS UP TO ME?

168
00:12:34,403 --> 00:12:36,867
LIKE AM I THE GUY?

169
00:12:36,867 --> 00:12:40,436
I HAD THIS FANTASY, RIGHT.
LIKE I'M IN MICHIGAN.

170
00:12:40,436 --> 00:12:43,280
I'M IN EVERY VAPE SHOP.

171
00:12:44,325 --> 00:12:50,679
AND IT'S JUST LIKE, BRO, BRO,
JOE, JOE.

172
00:12:51,322 --> 00:12:54,546
BUT I COULDN'T GO.
I COULDN'T GO.

173
00:12:54,546 --> 00:12:57,491
I DON'T LIKE EITHER OPTION TO BE
HONEST WITH YOU.

174
00:12:57,491 --> 00:12:59,726
I REALLY THINK OUR NEXT
PRESIDENT SHOULD BE A WOMAN.

175
00:12:59,726 --> 00:13:03,226
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
LIKE THAT WOULD BE AMAZING.

176
00:13:03,226 --> 00:13:07,736
I THINK OUR NEXT PRESIDENT
SHOULD BE A TRANSWOMAN.

177
00:13:09,112 --> 00:13:11,948
A LITTLE LESS SUPPORT, YEAH.

178
00:13:11,948 --> 00:13:13,747
THAT'S NEW YORK, RIGHT?

179
00:13:13,747 --> 00:13:17,525
NEW YORK'S LIKE WE'RE LIBERAL,
BUT WE'RE ITALIAN.

180
00:13:17,525 --> 00:13:19,748
WATCH OUT.

181
00:13:20,268 --> 00:13:23,638
NO.
I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT HER.
I REALLY HAVE.

182
00:13:23,638 --> 00:13:26,082
LIKE IMAGINE HER SPEECH.
IT WOULD BE SO INSPIRING.

183
00:13:26,082 --> 00:13:32,335
SHE WOULD BE LIKE, A LOT OF
POLITICIANS TALK ABOUT CHANGE --

184
00:13:34,543 --> 00:13:39,050
STICKER, RIGHT, LIKE REAL
CHANGE.

185
00:13:39,050 --> 00:13:43,562
SHE PUTS UP A BEFORE AND AFTER.
SHE'S LIKE, I CAN DO THAT TO THE
COUNTRY.

186
00:13:47,291 --> 00:13:50,139
IT'S JUST AN IDEA.

187
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:52,353
I'M OUT OF IDEAS.

188
00:13:52,353 --> 00:13:54,153
I REALLY AM.
I'M OUT OF IDEAS.

189
00:13:54,153 --> 00:13:57,519
ALL I HAVE ARE PRAYERS.
THAT'S ALL I CAN DO RIGHT NOW.

190
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:00,933
AND IN MY FRIEND GROUP, I'M ONE
OF THE ONLY GUYS WHO PRAYS.

191
00:14:00,933 --> 00:14:03,803
I'M FRIENDS WITH A LOT OF
SINNERS.

192
00:14:03,803 --> 00:14:06,727
LIKE JUST DISGUSTING PEOPLE.

193
00:14:06,727 --> 00:14:11,499
AND THEY CALL ME WHEN THEY'RE IN
TROUBLE BECAUSE THEY WANT ME TO
PRAY FOR THEM.

194
00:14:11,499 --> 00:14:14,482
SO I GET A CALL FROM MY BUDDY
BRIAN.
HE'S STRESSED.

195
00:14:14,482 --> 00:14:17,014
HE'S BEEN IN COURT FOR TEN HAD MONTHS

196
00:14:17,014 --> 00:14:20,616
WITH HIS EX, AND THEY'RE
FIGHTING OVER THE DOG.

197
00:14:20,616 --> 00:14:23,916
HE GOES, DUDE, SHE DOESN'T TAKE
CARE OF THE DOG.

198
00:14:23,916 --> 00:14:27,972
SHE FEEDS HIM KIBBLE, NOT WET
FOOD.

199
00:14:27,972 --> 00:14:31,274
I NEED HIM BACK.
IT'S JUST DESTROYING MY LIFE.

200
00:14:31,274 --> 00:14:33,753
PLEASE PRAY FOR ME.
I NEED HIM.

201
00:14:33,753 --> 00:14:36,225
I'M LIKE, I GOT YOU.

202
00:14:36,225 --> 00:14:38,370
AN HOUR GOES BY.

203
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:42,067
I GOT A FRIEND ACHMED CALLING
ME.

204
00:14:42,067 --> 00:14:44,151
HIS WHOLE FAMILY IS IN GAZA,

205
00:14:44,151 --> 00:14:47,074
AND HE GOES, RAMY, THEY'RE
SUFFERING.

206
00:14:47,074 --> 00:14:49,468
I DON'T KNOW WHERE HALF OF THEM
ARE.

207
00:14:49,468 --> 00:14:52,508
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.
PLEASE PRAY FOR THEM.

208
00:14:52,508 --> 00:14:55,822
IT'S THE ONLY THING WE CAN DO.
I'M LIKE, DUDE, I GOT YOU.

209
00:14:55,822 --> 00:14:58,472
SO THAT NIGHT, I GO TO PRAY,

210
00:14:58,472 --> 00:15:03,338
AND MY PRAYERS ARE COMPLICATED.

211
00:15:03,797 --> 00:15:05,843
I'VE GOT A LOT TO FIT IN.

212
00:15:05,843 --> 00:15:10,857
I'M LIKE, GOD, PLEASE, PLEASE
HELP ACHMED'S FAMILY.

213
00:15:10,925 --> 00:15:14,089
PLEASE STOP THE SUFFERING.
STOP THE VIOLENCE.

214
00:15:14,089 --> 00:15:19,281
PLEASE FREE THE PEOPLE OF
PALESTINE, PLEASE.

215
00:15:24,037 --> 00:15:26,006
PLEASE.

216
00:15:26,006 --> 00:15:30,121
AND PLEASE FREE THE HOSTAGES,

217
00:15:30,121 --> 00:15:32,647
ALL THE HOSTAGES, PLEASE

218
00:15:34,356 --> 00:15:39,100
AND WHILE YOU'RE AT IT --

219
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:42,242
-- YOU KNOW, FREE MR. BOJANGLES.

220
00:15:42,242 --> 00:15:49,507
HE'S A BEAUTIFUL DOG.
I'M PRAYING FOR THAT DOG.

221
00:15:50,476 --> 00:15:53,212
WE'VE GOT A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU
TONIGHT, ALL RIGHT?

222
00:15:53,212 --> 00:15:57,148
TRAVIS SCOTT IS HERE.

223
00:15:57,148 --> 00:16:00,249
STICK AROUND.
WE'LL

224
00:16:21,235 --> 00:16:23,172
TIME FOR

225
00:16:23,172 --> 00:16:26,069
HOST

226
00:16:26,967 --> 00:16:30,489
>>> ALL RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT.
WELCOME TO COUPLE GOALS,

227
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:33,640
A GAME
WHERE MARRIED COUPLES FIND OUT
JUST HOW WELL THEY KNOW EACH OTHER,

228
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:36,279
SPONSORED BY SWIFFER WET
JET.

229
00:16:36,279 --> 00:16:39,689
WANT TO SWIRL SOME WET HAIR
AROUND ON YOUR FLOOR,

230
00:16:39,689 --> 00:16:41,998
TRY SWIFFER WET JET.

231
00:16:41,998 --> 00:16:44,506
LET'S MEET OUR CONTESTANTS.

232
00:16:44,506 --> 00:16:47,777
THEY RECENTLY MOVED INTO THEIR
DREAM HOME,

233
00:16:47,777 --> 00:16:50,588
IT'S NICK AND NICOLE
LODI.

234
00:16:51,247 --> 00:16:54,885
AND THEY'RE CHILDHOOD
SWEETHEARTS WHO HAVE KNOWN EACH
OTHER SINCE THEY WERE 6.

235
00:16:54,885 --> 00:16:57,906
IT'S BRIAN AND ABBY GREEN.

236
00:16:57,906 --> 00:17:02,021
AS YOU KNOW, YOUR SPOUSES
ANSWERED A SERIES OF QUESTIONS BEFORE THE SHOW,

237
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:04,339
AND IT'S UP TO
YOU TO GUESS WHAT THEY SAID.

238
00:17:04,339 --> 00:17:07,694
QUESTION ONE, WHAT'S YOUR WIFE'S
FAVORITE BOOK?

239
00:17:07,694 --> 00:17:11,599
NICK.
>> I KNOW THAT ONE, BOB.
IT'S HARRY POTTER.

240
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:13,692
>> LET'S SEE WHAT NICOLE SAID.

241
00:17:13,692 --> 00:17:17,767
>> HARRY POTTER.
THAT'S MY HUFFLEPUFF!

242
00:17:17,767 --> 00:17:20,343
>> ALL RIGHT.
THE LODIS ARE ON THE BOARD.

243
00:17:20,343 --> 00:17:22,093
LET'S GO TO THE GREENS.

244
00:17:22,093 --> 00:17:26,144
>> WELL, I KNOW MY LITTLE
READER'S FAVORITE BOOK.

245
00:17:26,144 --> 00:17:28,323
IT'S WHERE THE CRAWDADS SING.

246
00:17:28,323 --> 00:17:31,123
>> LET'S SEE WHAT NICOLE SAID.

247
00:17:31,123 --> 00:17:32,935
OH, THE BIBLE.

248
00:17:32,935 --> 00:17:35,789
>> SORRY, BABE.
YOU WERE SO CLOSE.

249
00:17:35,789 --> 00:17:37,954
>> WAS HE?

250
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:41,430
LODIS, OVER TO YOU.
WHAT IS YOUR HUSBAND'S GREATEST
FEAR?

251
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:44,787
>> WELL, NOT SURE HE WANTS
PEOPLE TO KNOW THIS ONE,

252
00:17:44,787 --> 00:17:47,448
BUT
IT'S DEFINITELY HEIGHTS.

253
00:17:47,448 --> 00:17:51,671
>> OKAY.
SHE SAYS HEIGHTS, AND NICK SAYS
HIS GREATEST FEAR IS --

254
00:17:51,671 --> 00:17:54,520
THAT
YOU'LL DIE IN A BIZARRE ACCIDENT

255
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:58,048
AND EVEN THOUGH I HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH IT,
THE POLICE WILL ASSUME I DID IT

256
00:17:58,048 --> 00:18:02,978
AFTER
DISCOVERING HOW MUCH I
COMPLAINED ABOUT YOU IN TEXT
MESSAGES TO MY FRIENDS.

257
00:18:07,774 --> 00:18:10,731
>> I SHOULD HAVE SAID HEIGHTS.

258
00:18:10,731 --> 00:18:12,316
>> I'LL SAY.

259
00:18:12,316 --> 00:18:15,509
MOVING ON TO THE GREENS.
ABBY, WHAT IS YOUR HUSBAND'S
GREATEST FEAR?

260
00:18:15,509 --> 00:18:19,102
>> WELL, YOU WON'T SEE THIS MAN
AT A PICNIC.
IT'S BEES.

261
00:18:19,102 --> 00:18:23,096
>> OH, SHOOT.
I SAID LOSING THE KIDS.

262
00:18:23,338 --> 00:18:26,825
>> NO POINTS, BUT THE GREENS ARE
TRYING THEIR BEST.

263
00:18:26,825 --> 00:18:28,968
NEXT QUESTION IS FOR THE LODIS.

264
00:18:28,968 --> 00:18:31,898
WHAT'S SOMETHING YOUR HUSBAND
HAS ALWAYS WANTED TO KNOW?

265
00:18:31,898 --> 00:18:34,751
>> STILL A LITTLE THROWN BY THAT
LAST ONE.

266
00:18:34,751 --> 00:18:38,200
BUT THIS ONE'S EASY.
DO ALIENS EXIST.

267
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:41,105
>> OKAY.
AND NICK SAID HE'S ALWAYS WANTED TO KNOW --

268
00:18:41,105 --> 00:18:46,162
IF POLICE CAN STILL
READ YOUR TEXT MESSAGES IF YOU
DESTROY YOUR WIFE'S PHONE

269
00:18:46,162 --> 00:18:51,154
RIGHT
AFTER YOUR WIFE IS CRUSHED BY
THE GARAGE DOOR OR EQUIVALENT
ACCIDENT.

270
00:18:51,154 --> 00:18:54,314
>> NICK, WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN
TEXTING?

271
00:18:54,314 --> 00:18:56,505
>> WHOOPS.

272
00:18:56,505 --> 00:19:00,946
OVER TO ABBY.
WHAT'S SOMETHING YOUR HUSBAND
HAS ALWAYS WANTED TO KNOW?

273
00:19:00,946 --> 00:19:05,371
>> WELL, I THINK THIS ONE WILL
GET US BACK ON TRACK, IF THERE'S
AN AFTERLIFE.

274
00:19:05,371 --> 00:19:08,308
>> SOUNDS CONFIDENT.
BRIAN SAID --

275
00:19:08,507 --> 00:19:12,132
WHAT IT FEELS LIKE
TO BE WITH A MAN.

276
00:19:12,132 --> 00:19:15,407
>> WHY WOULD YOU SAY THAT ON TV,
BABE?

277
00:19:15,407 --> 00:19:19,889
>> I DIDN'T KNOW WE HAVE TO SHOW
OUR ANSWERS TO EVERYONE.

278
00:19:19,889 --> 00:19:24,142
>> AND THE GREENS CONTINUE TO BE
ODD BUT PLEASANT PEOPLE.

279
00:19:24,142 --> 00:19:27,730
NEXT QUESTION FOR THE LODIS.
WHAT WAS YOUR BIGGEST FIGHT
ABOUT?

280
00:19:27,730 --> 00:19:31,460
>> OKAY.
I KNOW THIS ONE.
THE HAWAII INCIDENT.

281
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:35,090
>> ALL RIGHT.
NICK SAYS THE HAWAII INCIDENT,
AND NICOLE SAYS

282
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:39,494
THE TIME WE WERE
IN HAWAII ON TOP OF A WATERFALL
AND I WANTED TO JUMP IN,

283
00:19:39,494 --> 00:19:43,812
BUT YOU
HELD ME BACK AND WOULDN'T LET ME
DO IT UNTIL THERE WERE OTHER
PEOPLE AROUND.

284
00:19:44,029 --> 00:19:45,781
FIVE POINTS AWAY.

285
00:19:45,781 --> 00:19:48,557
>> THAT'S WHY YOU WOULDN'T LET
ME JUMP?

286
00:19:49,029 --> 00:19:52,178
>> ALL RIGHT.
THAT SOUND MEANS IT'S TIME FOR A
BONUS QUESTION.

287
00:19:52,178 --> 00:19:53,111
THIS ONE'S FOR NICOLE.

288
00:19:53,111 --> 00:19:55,998
WHERE IS A PLACE YOUR HUSBAND
HAS ALWAYS WANTED TO VISIT?

289
00:19:55,998 --> 00:19:58,669
>> I MEAN, I FEEL LIKE I DON'T
EVEN KNOW THIS MAN.

290
00:19:58,669 --> 00:20:02,161
BUT I GUESS HE ALWAYS SAID
DURANGO.

291
00:20:02,161 --> 00:20:04,417
>> YES, BABY, YES.

292
00:20:04,417 --> 00:20:06,658
>> OKAY.
FINALLY.

293
00:20:06,658 --> 00:20:10,952
>> AND WHAT'S WITH THE DOT, DOT,

HE WAS A BABY.

540
00:30:03,752 --> 00:30:04,585
>> IT'S NOT SEX.

541
00:30:04,587 --> 00:30:07,521
>> LOOKS LIKE SEX.

542
00:30:07,523 --> 00:30:08,021

Y'ALL SEE THE SCORE?

559
00:31:13,489 --> 00:31:15,022
WE'RE PLAYING LIKE SOME PUNKS

560
00:31:15,024 --> 00:31:15,856
OUT THERE.

561
00:31:15,858 --> 00:31:19,126
AS YOUR COACH, I'VE GIVEN YOU

562
00:31:19,128 --> 00:31:20,260
SPEECH AFTER SPEECH, BUT CLEARLY

563
00:31:20,262 --> 00:31:21,361
SOMETHING ISN'T GETTING THROUGH.

564
00:31:21,363 --> 00:31:23,530
SO MAYBE YOU NEED TO HEAR FROM

565
00:31:23,532 --> 00:31:24,731
ONE OF YOUR OWN.

566
00:31:24,733 --> 00:31:25,098
CAPTAIN.

567
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:27,968
>> YEAH, COACH.

568
00:31:27,970 --> 00:31:29,503
GUYS, WE SHOULD BE UP BY 20

569
00:31:29,505 --> 00:31:31,171
POINTS RIGHT NOW, BUT WE'RE

570
00:31:31,173 --> 00:31:34,441
GETTING OUR ASSES KICKED BECAUSE

571
00:31:34,443 --> 00:31:41,548
WE'RE NOT FOCUSED ON THE

572
00:31:41,550 --> 00:31:41,982
FUNDAMENTALS.

573
00:31:41,984 --> 00:31:42,582
>> FUNDAMENTALS.

574
00:31:42,584 --> 00:31:45,018
>> WE LOST TO CANYON HIGH LAST

575
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:45,319
WEEK.

576
00:31:45,321 --> 00:31:46,987
MILLER'S OUT WITH AN ANKLE

577
00:31:46,989 --> 00:31:48,889
SPRAIN, AND ON TUESDAY, COACH

578
00:31:48,891 --> 00:31:50,090
ACCIDENTALLY SENT THAT WEIRD

579
00:31:50,092 --> 00:31:51,825
PICTURE OF HIMSELF TO THE TEAM

580
00:31:51,827 --> 00:31:53,794
GROUP CHAT INSTEAD OF HIS WIFE.

581
00:31:53,796 --> 00:31:55,629
BUT WE GOT TO MOVE PAST THAT.

582
00:31:55,631 --> 00:31:58,832
>> IT'S IN THE PAST, GENTLEMEN.

583
00:31:58,834 --> 00:32:00,567
>> I MEAN, LOOK, DID I WANT TO

584
00:32:00,569 --> 00:32:02,869
SEE COACH WEARING ONLY A FUR

585
00:32:02,871 --> 00:32:05,205
THONG AND CAT EARS ON ALL FOURS

586
00:32:05,207 --> 00:32:08,108
LICKING MILK OUT OF A BOWL?

587
00:32:08,110 --> 00:32:08,709
NO.

588
00:32:08,711 --> 00:32:11,345
BUT THAT'S NO EXCUSE TO NOT PLAY

589
00:32:11,347 --> 00:32:12,312
MY ASS OFF TONIGHT.

590
00:32:12,314 --> 00:32:13,613
>> NO EXCUSE!

591
00:32:13,615 --> 00:32:17,417
>> AND, YEAH, DID IT SUCK THAT

592
00:32:17,419 --> 00:32:21,288
COACH DIDN'T REALIZE WHAT HE HAD

593
00:32:21,290 --> 00:32:23,290
DONE AND SENT EVEN MORE PICTURES

594
00:32:23,292 --> 00:32:24,291
TO THE GROUP?

595
00:32:24,293 --> 00:32:25,425
YES, IT SUCKED.

596
00:32:25,427 --> 00:32:28,161
BUT WE CAN'T BE THINKING ABOUT

597
00:32:28,163 --> 00:32:28,628
THAT RIGHT NOW.

598
00:32:28,630 --> 00:32:29,763
>> IT'S JUST SOMETHING MY WIFE

599
00:32:29,765 --> 00:32:30,797
AND I DO, GENTLEMEN.

600
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:35,669
WE GOT TO MOVE ON FROM THAT.

601
00:32:35,671 --> 00:32:37,137
STOP THINKING ABOUT MY PICS.

602
00:32:37,139 --> 00:32:37,904
>> I'M NOT THINKING ABOUT YOUR

603
00:32:37,906 --> 00:32:38,605
PICS, COACH.

604
00:32:38,607 --> 00:32:42,009
I'M THINKING ABOUT THE VIDEO OF

605
00:32:42,011 --> 00:32:44,978
YOU GOING TO THE BATHROOM IN THE

606
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:45,412
LITTER BOX.

607
00:32:45,414 --> 00:32:45,812
>> ME TOO.

608
00:32:45,814 --> 00:32:47,514
>> IT DOESN'T MATTER WHY COACH'S

609
00:32:47,516 --> 00:32:50,450
WIFE GETS TURNED ON BY THAT, ALL

610
00:32:50,452 --> 00:32:50,817
RIGHT?

611
00:32:50,819 --> 00:32:52,586
SHE LIKES SEEING HIM GO TO THE

612
00:32:52,588 --> 00:32:54,121
BATHROOM IN A LITTER BOX.

613
00:32:54,123 --> 00:32:54,521
THAT'S IT.

614
00:32:54,523 --> 00:32:56,923
>> 26 YEARS OF MARRIAGE, FELLAS.

615
00:32:56,925 --> 00:32:59,092
YOU NEED TO MIX IT UP SOMETIMES.

616
00:32:59,094 --> 00:33:00,293
>> CAN I SAY SOMETHING?

617
00:33:00,295 --> 00:33:02,529
I'M SORRY I POSTED COACH'S VIDEO

618
00:33:02,531 --> 00:33:03,263
ON TIKTOK.

619
00:33:03,265 --> 00:33:04,064
I THOUGHT IT WAS AI.

620
00:33:04,066 --> 00:33:06,199
>> WE KNOW THAT, RODRIGUES.

621
00:33:06,201 --> 00:33:08,168
THE POINT IS NONE OF US HAVE AN

622
00:33:08,170 --> 00:33:10,003
EXCUSE TO BE PLAYING THIS BAD

623
00:33:10,005 --> 00:33:10,737
EXCEPT FOR CHRIS BECAUSE COACH

624
00:33:10,739 --> 00:33:17,711
IS HIS DAD.

625
00:33:17,713 --> 00:33:20,547
>> DON'T YOU WORRY ABOUT MY BOY.

626
00:33:20,549 --> 00:33:21,281
HE'S GOING TO TURN IT ON IN THE

627
00:33:21,283 --> 00:33:24,918
SECOND HALF.

628
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,653
>> SIR, I WANT TO FOCUS.

629
00:33:26,655 --> 00:33:29,523
BUT IT'S KIND OF HARD WHEN THE

630
00:33:29,525 --> 00:33:30,791
OTHER TEAM'S FANS KEEP LIKE

631
00:33:30,793 --> 00:33:32,092
SHINING LASER POINTERS ON THE

632
00:33:32,094 --> 00:33:34,127
FLOOR TRYING TO GET COACH TO

633
00:33:34,129 --> 00:33:34,561
CHASE THEM.

634
00:33:34,563 --> 00:33:38,398
>> WHICH I WON'T.

635
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:40,834
>> SORRY, A PACKAGE HERE FOR

636
00:33:40,836 --> 00:33:41,301
COACH WILLIAMS.

637
00:33:41,303 --> 00:33:42,669
>> MAN, THIS BETTER NOT BE

638
00:33:42,671 --> 00:33:47,007
ANOTHER ONE OF THEM -- IT IS.

639
00:33:47,009 --> 00:33:49,943
KITTY LITTER.

640
00:33:49,945 --> 00:33:51,378
Y'ALL SEE THIS?

641
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:53,780
THIS IS THE OTHER TEAM TRYING TO

642
00:33:53,782 --> 00:33:56,516
GET INTO OUR HEADS, AND IT

643
00:33:56,518 --> 00:33:57,751
WASN'T FUNNY THE FIRST TEN

644
00:33:57,753 --> 00:33:58,051
TIMES.

645
00:33:58,053 --> 00:34:03,590
IT'S NOT FUNNY NOW.

646
00:34:03,592 --> 00:34:04,458
>> LOOK, WE CAN STILL WIN THIS,

647
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:04,858
ALL RIGHT?

648
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:07,861
BUT WE GOT TO PLAY BETTER

649
00:34:07,863 --> 00:34:08,261
DEFENSE.

650
00:34:08,263 --> 00:34:10,063
SO WHOEVER YOU'RE COVERING, BE

651
00:34:10,065 --> 00:34:10,697
ON THEM.

652
00:34:10,699 --> 00:34:13,100
WHEREVER THEY GO, JUST FOLLOW

653
00:34:13,102 --> 00:34:13,600
THEM.

654
00:34:13,602 --> 00:34:15,635
JUST LIKE HOW WHEREVER THE COACH

655
00:34:15,637 --> 00:34:18,772
GOES, THE STATE APPOINTED SOCIAL

656
00:34:18,774 --> 00:34:19,206
WORKER GOES.

657
00:34:19,208 --> 00:34:20,240
>> DON'T MIND ME.

658
00:34:20,242 --> 00:34:21,975
JUST MAKING SURE EVERYBODY FEELS

659
00:34:21,977 --> 00:34:22,275
SAFE.

660
00:34:22,277 --> 00:34:23,877
>> GUYS, WHAT IS COACH FAMOUS

661
00:34:23,879 --> 00:34:25,112
FOR SAYING?

662
00:34:25,114 --> 00:34:26,847
>> THIS NAUGHTY KITTY CRAVES

663
00:34:26,849 --> 00:34:29,015
DISCIPLINE.

664
00:34:29,017 --> 00:34:32,519
>> NO, NOT FROM THE CAT VIDEOS.

665
00:34:32,521 --> 00:34:35,288
FROM WHAT HE SAYS IN PRACTICE.

666
00:34:35,290 --> 00:34:37,991
>> OH, PLAY THE GAME, NOT THE

667
00:34:37,993 --> 00:34:38,291
SCORE.

668
00:34:38,293 --> 00:34:39,593
>> EXACTLY.

669
00:34:39,595 --> 00:34:42,729
SO WHEN WE GO OUT THERE FOR THE

670
00:34:42,731 --> 00:34:43,497
SECOND HALF, LET'S SHOW UP JUST

671
00:34:43,499 --> 00:34:45,232
LIKE COACH SHOWED UP FOR US

672
00:34:45,234 --> 00:34:46,199
TODAY EVEN THOUGH ALL OF OUR

673
00:34:46,201 --> 00:34:48,268
PARENTS ASKED HIM NOT TO.

674
00:34:48,270 --> 00:34:51,304
>> THANK YOU, NATE.

675
00:34:51,306 --> 00:34:53,039
YOU KNOW, GENTLEMEN, I'M GOING

676
00:34:53,041 --> 00:34:55,108
TO BE REAL WITH YOU.

677
00:34:55,110 --> 00:34:58,245
WHEN I REALIZED WHAT I HAD DONE,

678
00:34:58,247 --> 00:34:59,813
I CONSIDERED GETTING INTO MY CAR

679
00:34:59,815 --> 00:35:02,415
AND DRIVING OFF TO START A NEW

680
00:35:02,417 --> 00:35:04,050
LIFE SOMEWHERE ELSE, BUT I

681
00:35:04,052 --> 00:35:04,651
COULDN'T LEAVE MY TEAM.

682
00:35:04,653 --> 00:35:06,586
COULDN'T LEAVE MY SON.

683
00:35:06,588 --> 00:35:07,921
AND I KNOW THAT ONE DAY, HE'S

684
00:35:07,923 --> 00:35:10,790
GOING TO EVENTUALLY TALK AGAIN.

685
00:35:10,792 --> 00:35:13,026
AND WHEN HE DOES, THE FIRST

686
00:35:13,028 --> 00:35:14,694
WORDS OUT OF HIS MOUTH ARE NOT

687
00:35:14,696 --> 00:35:16,663
GOING TO BE, DAD, I WANT TO GO

688
00:35:16,665 --> 00:35:18,598
LIVE WITH GRANDMA AND GRANDPA.

689
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:21,134
THEY'RE GOING TO BE, DAD, WE'RE

690
00:35:21,136 --> 00:35:22,569
STATE CHAMPIONS.

691
00:35:22,571 --> 00:35:23,803
NOW LET'S GET OUT THERE AND GET

692
00:35:23,805 --> 00:35:25,272
THIS WIN AND MAKE SOME

693
00:35:25,274 --> 00:35:25,639
HEADLINES.

694
00:35:25,641 --> 00:35:33,346
>> YEAH!

695
00:35:24,899 --> 00:35:29,089
KIDS, YOU'RE GOING TO BE LATE FOR
SCHOOL.

696
00:35:29,089 --> 00:35:32,684
YOU KNOW, FASTING FOR RAMADAN
USED TO BE EASY,

697
00:35:32,684 --> 00:35:35,807
BUT THE LAST
FEW YEARS WITH WORK AND A
GROWING FAMILY,

698
00:35:35,807 --> 00:35:37,668
IT'S FELT ALMOST
IMPOSSIBLE.

699
00:35:37,668 --> 00:35:39,997
BUT NOT ANYMORE. THANKS TO

700
00:35:39,997 --> 00:35:42,512
OZEMPIC FOR RAMADAN.

701
00:35:44,750 --> 00:35:49,053
>> OZEMPIC IS A MEDICATION
PRESCRIBED TO SUPPRESS HUNGER
AND SLOW DIGESTION,

702
00:35:49,053 --> 00:35:54,685
AND RAMADAN
IS A MONTH WHERE MUSLIMS SUSTAIN
FROM FOOD AND WATER FROM SUNRISE
TO SUNSET.

703
00:35:54,685 --> 00:35:57,186
>> I USED TO RUSH TO EAT A WHOLE
MEAL BEFORE DAWN.

704
00:35:57,186 --> 00:36:01,046
NOW I JUST GRAB MY PRAYER BEADS
AND OZEMPIC NEEDLES.

705
00:36:01,046 --> 00:36:05,306
AS LONG AS I SHOOT UP BEFORE THE
SUN RISES, IT'S HALAL.

706
00:36:07,388 --> 00:36:10,001
>> SINCE MY GR DOCTOR PRESCRIBED
OZEMPIC FOR RAMADAN,

707
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:11,960
I'VE NEVER
GOTTEN MORE WORK DONE.

708
00:36:12,029 --> 00:36:15,473
WHILE MY COWORKERS ARE AT LUNCH,
I'M ON GOOGLE SHEETS GOING HAM.

709
00:36:15,474 --> 00:36:16,501
NO HARAM

710
00:36:16,501 --> 00:36:20,656
>> RUNNING MY FOOD CART DURING
RAMADAN IS REALLY HARD,

711
00:36:20,656 --> 00:36:22,838
SMELLING
ALL MY DELICIOUS MEATS

712
00:36:22,838 --> 00:36:27,851
AND 48
HOUR MARINADES ON MY BUTTER
GRILL --

713
00:36:29,713 --> 00:36:32,981
WITH OZEMPIC FOR
RAMADAN, NOW I DON'T EVEN GET HANGRY

714
00:36:32,981 --> 00:36:34,944
WHEN WHITE WOMEN ASK IF I
HAVE SALMON.

715
00:36:35,011 --> 00:36:37,741
>> SIDE EFFECTS MAY INCLUDE
NAUSEA, HEADACHE,

716
00:36:37,741 --> 00:36:39,272
AND GOING
STRAIGHT TO HELL.

717
00:36:39,272 --> 00:36:42,175
CONVERTS

718
00:36:42,175 --> 00:36:45,871
>> I'VE ALWAYS LOVED THE SOUND
OF CAB DRIVERS YELLING ON THEIR PHONE IN ARABIC,

719
00:36:45,871 --> 00:36:47,783
AND IT MADE ME
WANT TO CONVERT TO ISLAM.

720
00:36:47,783 --> 00:36:50,596
THE ONLY THING HOLDING ME BACK
WAS FASTING FOR RAMADAN.

721
00:36:50,597 --> 00:36:52,374
OTHER RULES

722
00:36:52,374 --> 00:36:56,668
BUT NOW I CAN WALK INTO THE
MOSQUE WITH A FULL HEART

723
00:36:56,668 --> 00:36:59,344
AND A
27-INCH WAIST.

724
00:36:59,689 --> 00:37:04,052
>> OZEMPIC FOR RAMADAN HAS ALL
THE MIRACULOUS HUNGER-CRUSHING INGREDIENTS

725
00:37:04,052 --> 00:37:07,343
THAT REGULAR OZEMPIC
HAS WITHOUT ANY PORK.

726
00:37:07,343 --> 00:37:12,110
>> WHEN IT'S FINALLY TIME TO
EAT, I'M NOT EVEN HUNGRY.

727
00:37:12,110 --> 00:37:15,017
I THINK I'M GOING TO FAST THE
WHOLE MONTH STRAIGHT.

728
00:37:15,017 --> 00:37:17,256
PROBABLY GET EXTRA AWARDS FROM
GOD.

729
00:37:17,257 --> 00:37:19,326

00:53:09,754 --> 00:53:10,753
NOTHING WE CAN DO ABOUT IT,

1101
00:53:10,755 --> 00:53:15,624
RIGHT, BROTHER?

1102
00:53:15,626 --> 00:53:22,998
>> THEMS THE RULES.

1103
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,968
>> WHY DID IT HAVE TO BE

1104
00:53:25,970 --> 00:53:26,302
PIGEONS?

1105
00:53:26,304 --> 00:53:27,303
IT'S HUMILIATING.

1106
00:53:27,305 --> 00:53:30,940
THEY'RE A BUNCH OF CRUMB-PECKING

1107
00:53:30,942 --> 00:53:31,273
SKANKS.

1108
00:53:31,275 --> 00:53:31,640
I GET IT.

1109
00:53:31,642 --> 00:53:35,177
THEIR NECK GAME IS INSANE.

1110
00:53:35,179 --> 00:53:36,478
>> OKAY.

1111
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:38,280
>> HOO, HOO, HOO.

1112
00:53:38,282 --> 00:53:40,149
>> I'M -- YOU NO, I'M REALLY

1113
00:53:40,151 --> 00:53:40,449
SORRY.

1114
00:53:40,451 --> 00:53:43,218
I KNOW THIS MUST BE TOUGH FOR

1115
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:43,519
YOU.

1116
00:53:43,521 --> 00:53:46,088
>> EW, COLIN, ARE YOU COMING ON

1117
00:53:46,090 --> 00:53:46,956
TO ME?

1118
00:53:46,958 --> 00:53:49,558
>> NO, I'M NOT.

1119
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:51,593
>> YOU KNOW MY HUSBAND JUST

1120
00:53:51,595 --> 00:53:52,294
DIED, RIGHT?

1121
00:53:52,296 --> 00:53:53,162
>> OKAY.

1122
00:53:53,164 --> 00:53:53,562
I'M SORRY.

1123
00:53:53,564 --> 00:53:54,897
>> ALTHOUGH, YOU ARE MY TYPE.

1124
00:53:54,899 --> 00:53:57,399
>> WHAT TYPE IS THAT?

1125
00:53:57,401 --> 00:53:59,234
>> A NOCTURNAL PREDATOR.

1126
00:53:59,236 --> 00:54:01,670
>> FLACO'S WIDOW, EVERYONE.

1127
00:54:01,672 --> 00:54:02,705
FOR "WEEKEND UPDATE," I

1128
00:54:28,431 --> 00:54:33,102
>> LOOKS LIKE A MUGGING,

1129
00:54:33,104 --> 00:54:33,469
DETECTIVE.

1130
00:54:33,471 --> 00:54:36,438
HE WAS PICKING UP A PIZZA WHEN

1131
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:39,908
HE WAS STRUCK FROM BEHIND.

1132
00:54:39,910 --> 00:54:40,709
>> WHAT CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT

1133
00:54:40,711 --> 00:54:41,944
THE VIC?

1134
00:54:41,946 --> 00:54:44,146
>> NO ID YET.

1135
00:54:44,148 --> 00:54:44,713
HE'S MALE.

1136
00:54:44,715 --> 00:54:47,082
WE'RE THINKING MID 40s.

1137
00:54:47,084 --> 00:54:52,421
>> SHOULD GET ID RESULTS SOON.

1138
00:54:52,423 --> 00:54:54,323
>> POOR BASTARD WAS JUST PICKING

1139
00:54:54,325 --> 00:54:54,723
UP A PIZZA.

1140
00:54:54,725 --> 00:55:00,963
WHAT DO YOU THINK, SIMS?

1141
00:55:00,965 --> 00:55:01,630
>> I THINK -- HE SHOULD'VE

1142
00:55:01,632 --> 00:55:07,403
ORDERED DELIVERY.

1143
00:55:07,405 --> 00:55:10,005
>> YEAH.

1144
00:55:10,007 --> 00:55:11,540
SO, BASED ON THE STATE OF THE

1145
00:55:11,542 --> 00:55:13,308
BODY, I WOULD PUT TIME OF DEATH

1146
00:55:13,310 --> 00:55:14,777
MAYBE YESTERDAY, 5:00 P.M.

1147
00:55:14,779 --> 00:55:16,512
>> SO HE'S BEEN SITTING OUT HERE

1148
00:55:16,514 --> 00:55:16,945
ALL NIGHT.

1149
00:55:16,947 --> 00:55:17,446
>> YEAH.

1150
00:55:17,448 --> 00:55:19,248
NO SIGNS OF A STRUGGLE.

1151
00:55:19,250 --> 00:55:19,948
POOR GUY DIDN'T EVEN SEE HIM

1152
00:55:19,950 --> 00:55:22,451
COMING.

1153
00:55:22,453 --> 00:55:24,787
>> HOW YOU GUYS DOING?

1154
00:55:24,789 --> 00:55:25,721
>> NOT GREAT.

1155
00:55:25,723 --> 00:55:26,755
THE GUY'S DEAD.

1156
00:55:26,757 --> 00:55:27,189
>> YEAH.

1157
00:55:27,191 --> 00:55:27,523
TOTALLY.

1158
00:55:27,525 --> 00:55:30,025
POOR GUY.

1159
00:55:30,027 --> 00:55:33,429
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU, BUT I'M

1160
00:55:33,431 --> 00:55:34,696
THINKING THIS GUY -- SHOULD'VE

1161
00:55:34,698 --> 00:55:40,369
ORDERED DELIVERY.

1162
00:55:40,371 --> 00:55:40,869
>> YEAH, MAN.

1163
00:55:40,871 --> 00:55:43,405
WE HEARD YOU THE FIRST TIME.

1164
00:55:43,407 --> 00:55:44,540
>> OH, YOU DID?

1165
00:55:44,542 --> 00:55:45,307
>> YEAH.

1166
00:55:45,309 --> 00:55:46,208
YOU WERE RIGHT NEXT TO US.

1167
00:55:46,210 --> 00:55:47,209
>> OH, COOL.

1168
00:55:47,211 --> 00:55:49,044
JUST MAKING SURE BECAUSE YOU

1169
00:55:49,046 --> 00:55:52,381
GUYS DIDN'T REALLY LAUGH THE

1170
00:55:52,383 --> 00:55:52,781
FIRST TIME.

1171
00:55:52,783 --> 00:55:55,050
>> THERE ANY SIGNS OF THE MURDER

1172
00:55:55,052 --> 00:55:55,684
WEAPON ANYWHERE?

1173
00:55:55,686 --> 00:55:56,385
>> YEAH.

1174
00:55:56,387 --> 00:55:58,053
THIS PIPE WAS FOUND NEXT TO THE

1175
00:55:58,055 --> 00:55:58,353
BODY.

1176
00:55:58,355 --> 00:56:02,291
WE THINK THIS MIGHT BE IT.

1177
00:56:02,293 --> 00:56:04,660
>> PRETTY ROUGH SCENE, HUH?

1178
00:56:04,662 --> 00:56:05,461
>> YEAH.

1179
00:56:05,463 --> 00:56:06,161
PRETTY BAD.

1180
00:56:06,163 --> 00:56:08,964
>> I WAS JUST TELLING THESE

1181
00:56:08,966 --> 00:56:09,865
GUYS, I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU,

1182
00:56:09,867 --> 00:56:11,700
BUT IF I WAS THIS GUY, I WOULD

1183
00:56:11,702 --> 00:56:13,335
HAVE ORDERED --

1184
00:56:13,337 --> 00:56:15,471

ALL RIGHT?

1188
00:56:17,875 --> 00:56:19,374
IT'S JUST NOT FUNNY.

1189
00:56:19,376 --> 00:56:20,409
WE DIDN'T LAUGH.

1190
00:56:20,411 --> 00:56:22,744
>> YEAH, SIMS, A MAN IS DEAD.

1191
00:56:22,746 --> 00:56:24,746
>> YOU KNOW WHAT, YOU GUYS ARE

1192
00:56:24,748 --> 00:56:25,047
RIGHT.

1193
00:56:25,049 --> 00:56:25,781
THAT WAS INAPPROPRIATE, AND I'M

1194
00:56:25,783 --> 00:56:27,216
SORRY.

1195
00:56:27,218 --> 00:56:28,717
>> IT'S FINE.

1196
00:56:28,719 --> 00:56:29,885
JUST LET IT GO.

1197
00:56:29,887 --> 00:56:32,821
>> DETECTIVES, I'VE GOT THE ID

1198
00:56:32,823 --> 00:56:33,155
RESULTS.

1199
00:56:33,157 --> 00:56:35,591
THE VIC'S NAME IS RICHARD

1200
00:56:35,593 --> 00:56:37,726
TURKLE.

1201

LIVES UP ON 133rd STREET.

1202
00:56:38,596 --> 00:56:41,497

1203
00:56:41,499 --> 00:56:42,998
KNOWN ENEMIES?

1204
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:44,399
BECAUSE BASED ON THE CRIME

1205
00:56:44,401 --> 00:56:45,767
SCENE, IT'S CLEAR THAT SOMEBODY

1206
00:56:45,769 --> 00:56:52,674
WANTED A PIZZA HIM.

1207
00:56:52,676 --> 00:56:54,143
>> PIZZA HIM.

1208
00:56:54,145 --> 00:56:55,878

IT JUST CAME TO ME.

1212
00:57:01,852 --> 00:57:02,618
I DON'T KNOW HOW.

1213
00:57:02,620 --> 00:57:03,085
IT'S SO FUNNY.

1214
00:57:03,087 --> 00:57:05,454
>> THE HELL WAS THAT?

1215
00:57:05,456 --> 00:57:06,655
>> SORRY, MAN.

1216
00:57:06,657 --> 00:57:09,825
IT WAS JUST A LITTLE JOKE.

1217
00:57:09,827 --> 00:57:10,159
>> NO.

1218
00:57:10,161 --> 00:57:10,425
NO.

1219
00:57:10,427 --> 00:57:10,926
IT WASN'T A JOKE.

1220
00:57:10,928 --> 00:57:12,928
IT WAS A PUN.

1221
00:57:12,930 --> 00:57:15,197
YOU'RE ALL CREAMING YOUR JEANS

1222
00:57:15,199 --> 00:57:17,766
FOR A PUN!

1223

NO MORE JOKES.

1225
00:57:20,137 --> 00:57:21,436
A MAN IS DEAD.

1226
00:57:21,438 --> 00:57:23,605
LET'S JUST HAVE SOME RESPECT.

1227
00:57:23,607 --> 00:57:26,275
>> I GOT MRS. TURKLE HERE, THE

1230
00:57:28,846 --> 00:57:29,845
IS THAT RICH?

1231
00:57:29,847 --> 00:57:34,516
>> WE THINK SO, MRS. TURKLE.

1232
00:57:34,518 --> 00:57:36,518
WE JUST NEED YOU TO CONFIRM.

1233
00:57:36,520 --> 00:57:38,453
>> WHAT WILL I DO WITHOUT HIM?

1234
00:57:38,455 --> 00:57:40,289
HE WAS THE ONLY MAN I EVER

1235
00:57:40,291 --> 00:57:40,689
LOVED.

1236
00:57:40,691 --> 00:57:41,890
HE MADE ME SMILE.

1237
00:57:41,892 --> 00:57:43,091
HE MADE ME LAUGH.

1238
00:57:43,093 --> 00:57:44,927
>> SENSE OF HUMOR.

1239
00:57:44,929 --> 00:57:45,894
THAT'S SO IMPORTANT.

1240
00:57:45,896 --> 00:57:47,296
IT'S GOOD THAT HE HAD ONE.

1241
00:57:47,298 --> 00:57:48,564
>> YEAH.

1242
00:57:48,566 --> 00:57:49,932
HE WAS ALWAYS SPREADING

1243
00:57:49,934 --> 00:57:50,299
LAUGHTER.

1244
00:57:50,301 --> 00:57:52,968
HE WAS THE LIGHT OF MY LIFE.

1245
00:57:52,970 --> 00:57:55,103
>> A GUY WHO JUST WANTS TO MAKE

1246
00:57:55,105 --> 00:57:56,205
PEOPLE LAUGH.

1247
00:57:56,207 --> 00:57:57,706
MAYBE SOMETIMES SAYS THE WRONG

1248
00:57:57,708 --> 00:57:59,575
THING, BUT HE DON'T MEAN NO

1249
00:57:59,577 --> 00:57:59,875
HARM.

1250
00:57:59,877 --> 00:58:01,243
NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT.

1251
00:58:01,245 --> 00:58:03,445
>> NOW I DON'T KNOW IF I'LL EVER

1252
00:58:03,447 --> 00:58:03,979
LAUGH AGAIN.

1253
00:58:03,981 --> 00:58:11,653
>> I MEAN -- I WAS KIND OF

1254
00:58:11,655 --> 00:58:13,956
SAYING A JOKE TO THESE GUYS A

1255
00:58:13,958 --> 00:58:14,389
SECOND AGO.

1256
00:58:14,391 --> 00:58:15,324
>> DETECTIVE, NO.

1257
00:58:15,326 --> 00:58:17,893
>> NO, PLEASE, IT'S STRANGE, BUT

1258
00:58:17,895 --> 00:58:18,927
A JOKE WOULD BE NICE.

1259
00:58:18,929 --> 00:58:21,863
IT WOULD REMIND ME OF RICHARD.

1260
00:58:21,865 --> 00:58:27,135
>> I WAS JUST -- I WAS JUST

1261
00:58:27,137 --> 00:58:28,604
SAYING TO THESE GUYS BECAUSE OF

1262
00:58:28,606 --> 00:58:32,074
THE -- YOU NO, WE'RE AT A PIZZA

1263
00:58:32,076 --> 00:58:32,374
PLACE.

1264
00:58:32,376 --> 00:58:35,310
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU, BUT I'M

1265
00:58:35,312 --> 00:58:37,279
LOOKING AROUND, AND I DON'T KNOW

1266
00:58:37,281 --> 00:58:40,349
ABOUT YOU, BUT I'M KIND OF
