1
00:00:00,614 --> 00:00:04,359
>>> EASTER, THE CELEBRATION OF
THE REBIRTH OF CHRIST.

2
00:00:04,359 --> 00:00:08,304
THE BIBLE TELLS US THAT THREE
DAYS AFTER THE CRUCIFIXION OF JESUS,

3
00:00:08,304 --> 00:00:09,889
HE ROSE FROM THE DEAD.

4
00:00:09,889 --> 00:00:12,856
THE FIRST TO WITNESS THIS
MIRACLE WERE THREE WOMEN

5
00:00:12,856 --> 00:00:16,801
WHO HAD
COME TO ANOINT THE BODY OF JESUS
AND TEND TO HIS TOMB.

6
00:00:16,801 --> 00:00:21,498
THIS IS THE STORY OF THE
RESURRECTION.

7
00:00:31,144 --> 00:00:35,164
>>> THIS IS IT, THE TOMB WHERE
HIS BODY IS LAID.

8
00:00:35,164 --> 00:00:37,028
>> MOTHER MARY, DRY YOUR TEARS.

9
00:00:37,028 --> 00:00:39,442
MARY AND I ARE HERE TO SUPPORT
YOU.

10
00:00:39,442 --> 00:00:42,932
>> MARY IS RIGHT.
ALSO, WHEN WE'RE DONE GRIEVING,

11
00:00:42,932 --> 00:00:47,198
MAYBE WE SHOULD COME UP WITH A
GIRL'S NAME OTHER THAN MARY.

12
00:00:48,234 --> 00:00:51,150
>> WHAT IS THAT NOISE THAT COMES
FROM WITHIN?

13
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:54,234
>> LOOK, THE STONE, IT ROLLS
AWAY.

14
00:00:54,234 --> 00:00:56,462
>> IS IT JESUS?

15
00:00:56,939 --> 00:00:59,556
>> BASICALLY, YES.

16
00:01:04,416 --> 00:01:06,627
HAPPY EASTER, EVERYBODY.

17
00:01:06,627 --> 00:01:09,625
AS IT WAS STATED IN THE BIBLE,
GUESS WHO'S BACK,

18
00:01:09,625 --> 00:01:12,283
BACK AGAIN,
SHADY'S BACK.

19
00:01:12,516 --> 00:01:14,312
ALL RIGHT, GIRLS.
YOU CAN GO.

20
00:01:14,312 --> 00:01:16,245
NO MORE LINES.
YOU DID GREAT.

21
00:01:16,245 --> 00:01:18,074
BYE BYE.

22
00:01:18,727 --> 00:01:21,028
GET OUT OF HERE.

23
00:01:21,028 --> 00:01:22,886
THAT'S RIGHT. IT'S EASTER,

24
00:01:22,886 --> 00:01:26,790
THE TIME OF YEAR
WHEN I COMPARE MYSELF TO JESUS
CHRIST.

25
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:28,380
THAT'S JUST A THING I DO NOW,

26
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:31,358
AND PEOPLE SEEM TO BE OKAY WITH
IT.
I'M GOING TO KEEP DOING IT.

27
00:01:31,358 --> 00:01:33,496
IF YOU THINK THIS IS A BAD LOOK,

28
00:01:33,496 --> 00:01:36,803
IMAGINE HOW WEIRD IT WOULD BE IF
I STARTED SELLING BIBLES.

29
00:01:36,803 --> 00:01:41,015
WELL, I'M SELLING BIBLES.

30
00:01:41,015 --> 00:01:46,445
LOOK AT THIS BEAUTIFUL BIBLE
MADE FROM 100% BIBLE.

31
00:01:46,445 --> 00:01:51,005
SOUNDS LIKE A JOKE, AND IN MANY
WAYS IT IS, BUT IT'S ALSO VERY
REAL.

32
00:01:51,005 --> 00:01:55,242
AS YOU KNOW, I LOVE BIBLE.
IT'S MY FAVORITE BOOK.

33
00:01:55,242 --> 00:01:57,331
I'VE DEFINITELY READ IT.

34
00:01:57,331 --> 00:02:00,529
MY FAVORITE PART IS PROBABLY THE ENDING,

35
00:02:00,529 --> 00:02:02,905
HOW IT ALL WRAPS UP.

36
00:02:02,905 --> 00:02:05,476
BUT THIS IS A VERY SPECIAL
BIBLE.

37
00:02:05,476 --> 00:02:09,439
AND IT CAN BE YOURS FOR THE
HIGH, HIGH PRICE OF $60.

38
00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:12,143
BUT I'M NOT DOING THIS FOR THE
MONEY.

39
00:02:12,143 --> 00:02:15,681
I'M DOING THIS FOR THE GLORY OF GOD

40
00:02:15,681 --> 00:02:19,790
AND FOR PANDERING AND MOSTLY
FOR MONEY.

41
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:25,320
BUT IT'S SO SAD.
RELIGION AND CHRISTIANITY ARE
TOTALLY GONE FROM THIS COUNTRY,

42
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,438
AND WE NEED THEM BACK.

43
00:02:26,438 --> 00:02:30,664
WITHOUT RELIGION, YOU DON'T HAVE
LAWS, YOU DON'T HAVE MISSION
TRIPS.

44
00:02:30,664 --> 00:02:32,767
I'M TOLD MISSION TRIPS ARE A LOT
OF FUN.

45
00:02:32,767 --> 00:02:34,281
YOU GO TO MEXICO, BUILD A HOUSE,

46
00:02:34,281 --> 00:02:37,199
MAYBE MAKE OUT WITH SOMEONE ON
THE LAST NIGHT.

47
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:41,582
THEN IT'S BACK TO CLEAR WATER,
FLORIDA LIKE IT NEVER HAPPENED.

48
00:02:41,582 --> 00:02:46,788
BUT YOU'RE GOING TO LOVE MY NEW
AND EVEN BETTER BIBLE.

49
00:02:46,788 --> 00:02:49,253
IT COMES WITH EVERYTHING YOU
LIKE FROM BIBLE,

50
00:02:49,253 --> 00:02:51,828
LIKE THE STORY OF EASTER,

51
00:02:51,828 --> 00:02:55,402
WHICH PRIMARILY
CONCERNS JESUS, NOT SO MUCH THE
BUNNY.

52
00:02:55,402 --> 00:02:57,949
CAN'T WAIT
THE BUNNY NEVER SHOWED UP.

53
00:02:57,949 --> 00:02:59,279
THAT'S OKAY.

54
00:02:59,279 --> 00:03:03,787
NOW, MY BIBLE ALSO INCLUDES SOME
BEAUTIFUL ILLUSTRATIONS

55
00:03:03,787 --> 00:03:06,962
LIKE
MOSES FLOATING DOWN THE RIVER IN
THE BASKET,

56
00:03:06,962 --> 00:03:10,584
AND UH-OH, LOOK OUT,
HERE'S TRUMP IN THE BASKET.

57
00:03:10,584 --> 00:03:13,812
RIGHT BEHIND MOSES ABOUT TO PASS
ON THE LEFT.

58
00:03:13,812 --> 00:03:20,106
AND HERE I AM IN THE GARDEN OF
EDEN WITH MY ACTUAL BODY.

59
00:03:20,106 --> 00:03:23,487
YOU KNOW, I THINK I WOULD BE
VERY GOOD AT SAYING NO TO THE SNAKE

60
00:03:23,487 --> 00:03:26,986
FROM THE STANDPOINT OF NOT
LIKING FRUIT.

61
00:03:26,986 --> 00:03:32,326
AND HERE'S NOAH'S ARK, ALL THE
ANIMALS ARE ON THE ARK OF
COURSE.

62
00:03:32,326 --> 00:03:37,111
THERE'S ME YELLING AT NOAH, HEY,
BUDDY, YOU FORGOT THE RACCOON.

63
00:03:37,177 --> 00:03:40,793
BUT WE LOVE RELIGION, AND WE
LOVE GOD.

64
00:03:40,793 --> 00:03:43,941
HE'S PROBABLY THE BEST PART OF
THE HOLY TRINITY.

65
00:03:43,941 --> 00:03:47,334
HE'S LIKE THE BEYONCE.
COWBOY CARTER.

66
00:03:48,685 --> 00:03:53,335
GOD'S THE BEYONCE, JESUS IS THE
KELLY ROWLAND,

67
00:03:53,335 --> 00:03:56,994
AND HOLY GHOST
WOULD PROBABLY BE THE BLACK MICHELLE WILLIAMS

68
00:03:56,994 --> 00:03:59,570
WHO'S VERY
IMPORTANT TO A GREAT NUMBER OF
PEOPLE.

69
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:05,384
ALMOST AS IMPORTANT AS THE WHITE
MICHELLE WILLIAMS IS TO WHITE
PEOPLE.

70
00:04:05,384 --> 00:04:08,315
AND WE BELIEVE THERE WAS A
FOURTH DESTINY CHILD,

71
00:04:08,315 --> 00:04:10,426
BUT WE'LL
BE LOOKING INTO THAT VERY
STRONGLY.

72
00:04:10,426 --> 00:04:12,599
VERY SHORTLY.

73
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:15,724
BILLS, BILLS, BILLS, THAT'S A
GOOD ONE.
I LIKE THAT ONE.

74
00:04:15,724 --> 00:04:19,567
I WOULD LOVE SOMEONE TO PAY
MINE.
ANY TAKERS?

75
00:04:19,567 --> 00:04:20,857
NO.

76
00:04:20,857 --> 00:04:23,022
WELL, BACK TO MY BEAUTIFUL BIBLE,

77
00:04:23,022 --> 00:04:28,686
WHICH ALSO INCLUDES
CONSTITUTION AND PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE,

78
00:04:28,686 --> 00:04:32,392
AND -- I DON'T KNOW,
MAYBE MIRANDA RIGHTS,

79
00:04:32,392 --> 00:04:35,920
WHICH
MEANS UNFORTUNATELY WE HAD TO
MAKE SOME CUTS.

80
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:39,875
THIS BIBLE WILL NOT FEATURE AMOS
OR HABAKKUK.

81
00:04:39,875 --> 00:04:45,281
SORRY, HABAKKUK, BUT NOW I THINK
IT REALLY COOKS.
IT'S TIGHT.

82
00:04:45,281 --> 00:04:50,759
AND IF YOU ORDER NOW, WE'LL ALSO
THROW IN A FREE TRUMP MIRACLE
TOASTER.

83
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:56,156
YOU KNOW HOW SOMETIMES WEIRDOS
SEE A PICTURE OF JESUS OR
SOMETHING IN THEIR TOAST?

84
00:04:56,156 --> 00:04:58,959
WELL, HOW ABOUT THE MIRACLE OF
TRUMP?

85
00:04:58,959 --> 00:05:03,235
AND THIS IS GREAT.
THE OTHER SIDE DOES HELLO KITTY

86
00:05:03,235 --> 00:05:08,740
IF YOU HAVE A DAUGHTER OR
PERHAPS A SON WHO'S TAKING DANCE
CLASSES.

87
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:11,179
ANYWAY, IT'S EASTER EVE,

88
00:05:11,179 --> 00:05:14,349
SO LET US BOW OUR HEADS -- I'M NOT
GOING TO --

89
00:05:14,349 --> 00:05:19,850
AND SAY THE LORD'S
PRAYER, WHICH WE ALL KNOW VERY
WELL, ME ESPECIALLY.

90
00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:23,465
OUR FATHER WHO ARE IN HEAVEN,

91
00:05:23,532 --> 00:05:25,369
HALLOWED

92
00:05:28,452 --> 00:05:31,489
TRESPASS, DAILY BREAD,

93
00:05:31,489 --> 00:05:35,332
AND PLEASE LEAD US INTO
TEMPTATION,

94
00:05:35,332 --> 00:05:38,469
AND PAY OUR
AUTOMOBILES.

95
00:05:38,469 --> 00:05:43,483
IN THE NAME OF FATHER, THE SON,
AND THE EASTER BUNNY, AMEN,

96
00:05:43,483 --> 00:05:47,107
AND
LIVE FROM NEW YORK, IT'S
SATURDAY NIGHT!

97
00:07:53,631 --> 00:07:58,514
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, RAMY
YOUSSEF!

98
00:08:23,094 --> 00:08:28,172
SPIRITUAL WEEKEND

99
00:08:28,172 --> 00:08:30,842
WE'RE IN THE HOLY MONTH OF
RAMADAN.

100
00:08:32,818 --> 00:08:34,896
TOMORROW IS EASTER.

101
00:08:34,896 --> 00:08:38,715
AND YESTERDAY, BEYONCE RELEASED
A NEW ALBUM.

102
00:08:38,715 --> 00:08:44,097
THERE'S JUST SO MANY RELIGIONS
CELEBRATING ALL AT ONCE.

103
00:08:44,097 --> 00:08:46,958
I'M DOING THE RAMADAN ONE.

104
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:51,586
I LOVE RAMADAN BECAUSE I LOVE
HANGING OUT WITH MUSLIMS.
WE'RE SO LOVING.

105
00:08:51,586 --> 00:08:53,730
AND I FEEL LIKE PEOPLE DON'T
KNOW THAT ABOUT US.

106
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:56,981
THEY KNOW ALL THESE OTHER
THINGS, BUT MAN, WE LOVE TO
LOVE.

107
00:08:56,981 --> 00:08:58,572
WE'RE SO FREE WITH IT.

108
00:08:58,637 --> 00:09:02,255
MY FRIENDS THAT I GREW UP WITH,
THEY WERE REALLY WEIRD ABOUT
LOVE.

109
00:09:02,255 --> 00:09:06,411
I HAVE A BUDDY OF MINE WHO WAS
LIKE, MAN, I'VE BEEN HANGING OUT
WITH THIS GIRL, DUDE,

110
00:09:06,411 --> 00:09:11,664
AND I TOLD
HER I LOVED HER.
IT'S ONLY BEEN NINE MONTHS.

111
00:09:11,664 --> 00:09:16,534
I WAS LIKE, DUDE, I JUST SAID
THAT TO MY UBER DRIVER.

112
00:09:16,534 --> 00:09:21,093
I GAVE HIM MY NUMBER.
I WAS LIKE, BRO, LET'S GET OFF
THE APP.

113
00:09:21,093 --> 00:09:25,433
I WANT TO GET TO KNOW YOU.
YOU MEAN SOMETHING TO ME.

114
00:09:25,433 --> 00:09:28,378
NINE MONTHS?
YOU SHOULD HAVE A KID.

115
00:09:28,378 --> 00:09:30,405
IT'S TOO MUCH.

116
00:09:30,405 --> 00:09:33,871
AND PEOPLE DON'T GET US, AND
THERE'S ALL THIS DIVISION, BUT
IT'S NOT WHERE YOU THINK IT IS.

117
00:09:33,871 --> 00:09:35,788
SO I LIVE IN NEW YORK.
WE'RE IN THIS BUBBLE.

118
00:09:35,788 --> 00:09:38,860
WE THINK EVERYTHING WE DISAGREE
WITH IS IN THE SOUTH.

119
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:42,916
BUT I DON'T BELIEVE IN THE
SOUTH.

120
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:44,810
THERE IS NO SOUTH.

121
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:49,533
LIKE, THE SOUTH IS 45 MINUTES
AWAY FROM WHEREVER YOU ARE.

122
00:09:49,889 --> 00:09:52,235
I HAD A SHOW IN UPSTATE NEW
YORK.

123
00:09:52,235 --> 00:09:54,144
I WAS WALKING THROUGH THE
NEIGHBORHOOD.

124
00:09:54,144 --> 00:09:57,891
THERE'S ALL THIS TRUMP STUFF,
FLAGS, RED HATS,

125
00:09:57,891 --> 00:10:01,665
I WAS LIKE, YO,
I WENT NORTH,

126
00:10:01,665 --> 00:10:04,159
BUT I'M SOUTH.

127
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:07,178
AND I COULD FEEL IT, YOU KNOW, I
COULD FEEL THE FEAR.

128
00:10:07,178 --> 00:10:09,656
WHEN MY MOM CALLED ME, I DIDN'T
WANT TO SPEAK ARABIC.

129
00:10:09,657 --> 00:10:11,345
SALAM

130
00:10:11,345 --> 00:10:15,125
I WAS LIKE, MOTHER, PEACE BE
UPON YOU.
LIKE, I --

131
00:10:15,125 --> 00:10:20,557
YOU KNOW, AND THE
PROFIT, YOU KNOW WHICH PROFIT.

132
00:10:20,557 --> 00:10:23,767
THE BEST ONE, THE LAST ONE.

133
00:10:27,802 --> 00:10:30,830
IT'S TOUGH BECAUSE IT'S AN
ELECTION YEAR.

134
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:33,433
THAT'S WHEN YOU CAN FEEL IT.
EVERYONE'S FREAKING OUT.

135
00:10:33,433 --> 00:10:37,972
FOR ME, WHERE I'M AT NOW, I KNOW
BIDEN'S GOING TO CALL.

136
00:10:37,972 --> 00:10:41,544
CALL
HE'LL PROBABLY FORGET.

137
00:10:41,544 --> 00:10:45,017
BUT I THINK SOMEBODY WILL CALL.

138
00:10:45,017 --> 00:10:49,646
LIKE IN 2020, I GOT A CALL FROM
MUHAMMAD AT BIDEN.

139
00:10:49,646 --> 00:10:53,283
YOU KNOW THEY THOUGHT THAT WAS
SO COOL.

140
00:10:53,283 --> 00:10:58,468
LIKE BEN WAS GOING TO CALL, AND
THEY WERE LIKE, NO, NO, LET
MUHAMMAD DO IT.

141
00:10:58,468 --> 00:11:01,979
RAMY'S GOING TO LIKE THAT
ENERGY.

142
00:11:01,979 --> 00:11:04,620
HE GOES, RAMY, WE LOVE YOU.

143
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:08,129
WE LOVE EVERYTHING THAT YOU'VE
DONE FOR ARAB AMERICA.

144
00:11:08,129 --> 00:11:11,050
HE SAID IT LIKE IT WAS A
COUNTRY.

145
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:15,304
HE GOES, EVERYONE ON THE
CAMPAIGN IS SUCH A BIG FAN OF
YOUR WORK.

146
00:11:15,304 --> 00:11:17,833
AND JOE'S AWARE, RIGHT.

147
00:11:17,833 --> 00:11:22,216
THAT'S HUGE, RIGHT, BECAUSE JOE
HAS AN AWARENESS ISSUE.

148
00:11:22,216 --> 00:11:26,587
I MEAN, JOE'S AWARE.
THAT'S LIKE A NOBEL PEACE PRIZE.

149
00:11:26,587 --> 00:11:29,964
WE SAID YOUR NAME, JOE WAS
NODDING.

150
00:11:29,964 --> 00:11:33,284
JOE LOOKS GOOD WHEN HE'S AWARE.
YOU'VE SEEN HIM, RIGHT?

151
00:11:33,284 --> 00:11:37,938
YOU KNOW THOSE DAYS WHEN HE
COMES OUT AND HE'S JUST LIKE
THAWED.

152
00:11:38,733 --> 00:11:43,212
THEY GIVE HIM AN EXTRA TEN IN
THE MICROWAVE.
HE'S JUST LIT UP.

153
00:11:43,212 --> 00:11:46,056
HE LOOKS GOOD.
AND HE SAYS STUFF THAT'S
INSPIRING.

154
00:11:46,056 --> 00:11:49,207
IT DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING, BUT
IT'S GOOD.

155
00:11:49,207 --> 00:11:51,895
HE'LL BE LIKE, I RIDE THE TRAIN.

156
00:11:51,895 --> 00:11:54,956
YOU'RE LIKE, SICK, WHERE'S IT
GOING.

157
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:58,693
AND YOU NEVER FIND OUT.

158
00:11:59,138 --> 00:12:03,373
BUT MUHAMMAD GOES TO ME, RAMY,
LISTEN, THIS IS A TOUGH
ELECTION.

159
00:12:03,373 --> 00:12:06,720
THERE'S A LOT OF BATTLEGROUNDS,

160
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:11,327
BUT WE'VE REALIZED IF WE CAN WIN
JUST ONE, WE'LL GET THE WHOLE
COUNTRY.

161
00:12:11,327 --> 00:12:15,693
THE ONLY STATE WE NEED IS
MICHIGAN.

162
00:12:15,693 --> 00:12:18,392
ARAB AMERICA.

163
00:12:18,392 --> 00:12:21,128
HE GOES, RAMY, GO TO MICHIGAN.

164
00:12:21,128 --> 00:12:24,142
TELL THE ARABS TO VOTE FOR JOE,

165
00:12:24,142 --> 00:12:27,335
AND YOU COULD CHANGE THE COURSE
OF AMERICAN HISTORY.

166
00:12:27,335 --> 00:12:30,805
AND OUR COUNTRY'S SO MESSED UP
THAT FOR FIVE MINUTES, I WAS LIKE,

167
00:12:30,805 --> 00:12:33,364
IS THIS UP TO ME?

168
00:12:34,403 --> 00:12:36,867
LIKE AM I THE GUY?

169
00:12:36,867 --> 00:12:40,436
I HAD THIS FANTASY, RIGHT.
LIKE I'M IN MICHIGAN.

170
00:12:40,436 --> 00:12:43,280
I'M IN EVERY VAPE SHOP.

171
00:12:44,325 --> 00:12:50,679
AND IT'S JUST LIKE, BRO, BRO,
JOE, JOE.

172
00:12:51,322 --> 00:12:54,546
BUT I COULDN'T GO.
I COULDN'T GO.

173
00:12:54,546 --> 00:12:57,491
I DON'T LIKE EITHER OPTION TO BE
HONEST WITH YOU.

174
00:12:57,491 --> 00:12:59,726
I REALLY THINK OUR NEXT
PRESIDENT SHOULD BE A WOMAN.

175
00:12:59,726 --> 00:13:03,226
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
LIKE THAT WOULD BE AMAZING.

176
00:13:03,226 --> 00:13:07,736
I THINK OUR NEXT PRESIDENT
SHOULD BE A TRANSWOMAN.

177
00:13:09,112 --> 00:13:11,948
A LITTLE LESS SUPPORT, YEAH.

178
00:13:11,948 --> 00:13:13,747
THAT'S NEW YORK, RIGHT?

179
00:13:13,747 --> 00:13:17,525
NEW YORK'S LIKE WE'RE LIBERAL,
BUT WE'RE ITALIAN.

180
00:13:17,525 --> 00:13:19,748
WATCH OUT.

181
00:13:20,268 --> 00:13:23,638
NO.
I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT HER.
I REALLY HAVE.

182
00:13:23,638 --> 00:13:26,082
LIKE IMAGINE HER SPEECH.
IT WOULD BE SO INSPIRING.

183
00:13:26,082 --> 00:13:32,335
SHE WOULD BE LIKE, A LOT OF
POLITICIANS TALK ABOUT CHANGE --

184
00:13:34,543 --> 00:13:39,050
STICKER, RIGHT, LIKE REAL
CHANGE.

185
00:13:39,050 --> 00:13:43,562
SHE PUTS UP A BEFORE AND AFTER.
SHE'S LIKE, I CAN DO THAT TO THE
COUNTRY.

186
00:13:47,291 --> 00:13:50,139
IT'S JUST AN IDEA.

187
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:52,353
I'M OUT OF IDEAS.

188
00:13:52,353 --> 00:13:54,153
I REALLY AM.
I'M OUT OF IDEAS.

189
00:13:54,153 --> 00:13:57,519
ALL I HAVE ARE PRAYERS.
THAT'S ALL I CAN DO RIGHT NOW.

190
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:00,933
AND IN MY FRIEND GROUP, I'M ONE
OF THE ONLY GUYS WHO PRAYS.

191
00:14:00,933 --> 00:14:03,803
I'M FRIENDS WITH A LOT OF
SINNERS.

192
00:14:03,803 --> 00:14:06,727
LIKE JUST DISGUSTING PEOPLE.

193
00:14:06,727 --> 00:14:11,499
AND THEY CALL ME WHEN THEY'RE IN
TROUBLE BECAUSE THEY WANT ME TO
PRAY FOR THEM.

194
00:14:11,499 --> 00:14:14,482
SO I GET A CALL FROM MY BUDDY
BRIAN.
HE'S STRESSED.

195
00:14:14,482 --> 00:14:17,014
HE'S BEEN IN COURT FOR TEN HAD MONTHS 

196
00:14:17,014 --> 00:14:20,616
WITH HIS EX, AND THEY'RE
FIGHTING OVER THE DOG.

197
00:14:20,616 --> 00:14:23,916
HE GOES, DUDE, SHE DOESN'T TAKE
CARE OF THE DOG.

198
00:14:23,916 --> 00:14:27,972
SHE FEEDS HIM KIBBLE, NOT WET
FOOD.

199
00:14:27,972 --> 00:14:31,274
I NEED HIM BACK.
IT'S JUST DESTROYING MY LIFE.

200
00:14:31,274 --> 00:14:33,753
PLEASE PRAY FOR ME.
I NEED HIM.

201
00:14:33,753 --> 00:14:36,225
I'M LIKE, I GOT YOU.

202
00:14:36,225 --> 00:14:38,370
AN HOUR GOES BY.

203
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:42,067
I GOT A FRIEND ACHMED CALLING
ME.

204
00:14:42,067 --> 00:14:44,151
HIS WHOLE FAMILY IS IN GAZA, 

205
00:14:44,151 --> 00:14:47,074
AND HE GOES, RAMY, THEY'RE
SUFFERING.

206
00:14:47,074 --> 00:14:49,468
I DON'T KNOW WHERE HALF OF THEM
ARE.

207
00:14:49,468 --> 00:14:52,508
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.
PLEASE PRAY FOR THEM.

208
00:14:52,508 --> 00:14:55,822
IT'S THE ONLY THING WE CAN DO.
I'M LIKE, DUDE, I GOT YOU.

209
00:14:55,822 --> 00:14:58,472
SO THAT NIGHT, I GO TO PRAY,

210
00:14:58,472 --> 00:15:03,338
 AND MY PRAYERS ARE COMPLICATED.

211
00:15:03,797 --> 00:15:05,843
I'VE GOT A LOT TO FIT IN.

212
00:15:05,843 --> 00:15:10,857
I'M LIKE, GOD, PLEASE, PLEASE
HELP ACHMED'S FAMILY.

213
00:15:10,925 --> 00:15:14,089
PLEASE STOP THE SUFFERING.
STOP THE VIOLENCE.

214
00:15:14,089 --> 00:15:19,281
PLEASE FREE THE PEOPLE OF
PALESTINE, PLEASE.

215
00:15:24,037 --> 00:15:26,006
PLEASE.

216
00:15:26,006 --> 00:15:30,121
AND PLEASE FREE THE HOSTAGES,

217
00:15:30,121 --> 00:15:32,647
ALL THE HOSTAGES, PLEASE

218
00:15:34,356 --> 00:15:39,100
AND WHILE YOU'RE AT IT --

219
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:42,242
-- YOU KNOW, FREE MR. BOJANGLES.

220
00:15:42,242 --> 00:15:49,507
HE'S A BEAUTIFUL DOG.
I'M PRAYING FOR THAT DOG.

221
00:15:50,476 --> 00:15:53,212
WE'VE GOT A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU
TONIGHT, ALL RIGHT?

222
00:15:53,212 --> 00:15:57,148
TRAVIS SCOTT IS HERE.

223
00:15:57,148 --> 00:16:00,249
STICK AROUND.
WE'LL

224
00:16:21,235 --> 00:16:23,172
TIME FOR

225
00:16:23,172 --> 00:16:26,069
HOST

226
00:16:26,967 --> 00:16:30,489
>>> ALL RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT.
WELCOME TO COUPLE GOALS, 

227
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:33,640
A GAME
WHERE MARRIED COUPLES FIND OUT
JUST HOW WELL THEY KNOW EACH OTHER,

228
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:36,279
 SPONSORED BY SWIFFER WET
JET.

229
00:16:36,279 --> 00:16:39,689
WANT TO SWIRL SOME WET HAIR
AROUND ON YOUR FLOOR, 

230
00:16:39,689 --> 00:16:41,998
TRY SWIFFER WET JET.

231
00:16:41,998 --> 00:16:44,506
LET'S MEET OUR CONTESTANTS.

232
00:16:44,506 --> 00:16:47,777
THEY RECENTLY MOVED INTO THEIR
DREAM HOME,

233
00:16:47,777 --> 00:16:50,588
 IT'S NICK AND NICOLE
LODI.

234
00:16:51,247 --> 00:16:54,885
AND THEY'RE CHILDHOOD
SWEETHEARTS WHO HAVE KNOWN EACH
OTHER SINCE THEY WERE 6.

235
00:16:54,885 --> 00:16:57,906
IT'S BRIAN AND ABBY GREEN.

236
00:16:57,906 --> 00:17:02,021
AS YOU KNOW, YOUR SPOUSES
ANSWERED A SERIES OF QUESTIONS BEFORE THE SHOW, 

237
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:04,339
AND IT'S UP TO
YOU TO GUESS WHAT THEY SAID.

238
00:17:04,339 --> 00:17:07,694
QUESTION ONE, WHAT'S YOUR WIFE'S
FAVORITE BOOK?

239
00:17:07,694 --> 00:17:11,599
NICK.
>> I KNOW THAT ONE, BOB.
IT'S HARRY POTTER.

240
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:13,692
>> LET'S SEE WHAT NICOLE SAID.

241
00:17:13,692 --> 00:17:17,767
>> HARRY POTTER.
THAT'S MY HUFFLEPUFF!

242
00:17:17,767 --> 00:17:20,343
>> ALL RIGHT.
THE LODIS ARE ON THE BOARD.

243
00:17:20,343 --> 00:17:22,093
LET'S GO TO THE GREENS.

244
00:17:22,093 --> 00:17:26,144
>> WELL, I KNOW MY LITTLE
READER'S FAVORITE BOOK.

245
00:17:26,144 --> 00:17:28,323
IT'S WHERE THE CRAWDADS SING.

246
00:17:28,323 --> 00:17:31,123
>> LET'S SEE WHAT NICOLE SAID.

247
00:17:31,123 --> 00:17:32,935
OH, THE BIBLE.

248
00:17:32,935 --> 00:17:35,789
>> SORRY, BABE.
YOU WERE SO CLOSE.

249
00:17:35,789 --> 00:17:37,954
>> WAS HE?

250
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:41,430
LODIS, OVER TO YOU.
WHAT IS YOUR HUSBAND'S GREATEST
FEAR?

251
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:44,787
>> WELL, NOT SURE HE WANTS
PEOPLE TO KNOW THIS ONE,

252
00:17:44,787 --> 00:17:47,448
 BUT
IT'S DEFINITELY HEIGHTS.

253
00:17:47,448 --> 00:17:51,671
>> OKAY.
SHE SAYS HEIGHTS, AND NICK SAYS
HIS GREATEST FEAR IS -- 

254
00:17:51,671 --> 00:17:54,520
THAT
YOU'LL DIE IN A BIZARRE ACCIDENT

255
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:58,048
AND EVEN THOUGH I HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH IT, 
THE POLICE WILL ASSUME I DID IT 

256
00:17:58,048 --> 00:18:02,978
AFTER
DISCOVERING HOW MUCH I
COMPLAINED ABOUT YOU IN TEXT
MESSAGES TO MY FRIENDS.

257
00:18:07,774 --> 00:18:10,731
>> I SHOULD HAVE SAID HEIGHTS.

258
00:18:10,731 --> 00:18:12,316
>> I'LL SAY.

259
00:18:12,316 --> 00:18:15,509
MOVING ON TO THE GREENS.
ABBY, WHAT IS YOUR HUSBAND'S
GREATEST FEAR?

260
00:18:15,509 --> 00:18:19,102
>> WELL, YOU WON'T SEE THIS MAN
AT A PICNIC.
IT'S BEES.

261
00:18:19,102 --> 00:18:23,096
>> OH, SHOOT.
I SAID LOSING THE KIDS.

262
00:18:23,338 --> 00:18:26,825
>> NO POINTS, BUT THE GREENS ARE
TRYING THEIR BEST.

263
00:18:26,825 --> 00:18:28,968
NEXT QUESTION IS FOR THE LODIS.

264
00:18:28,968 --> 00:18:31,898
WHAT'S SOMETHING YOUR HUSBAND
HAS ALWAYS WANTED TO KNOW?

265
00:18:31,898 --> 00:18:34,751
>> STILL A LITTLE THROWN BY THAT
LAST ONE.

266
00:18:34,751 --> 00:18:38,200
BUT THIS ONE'S EASY.
DO ALIENS EXIST.

267
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:41,105
>> OKAY.
AND NICK SAID HE'S ALWAYS WANTED TO KNOW --

268
00:18:41,105 --> 00:18:46,162
 IF POLICE CAN STILL
READ YOUR TEXT MESSAGES IF YOU
DESTROY YOUR WIFE'S PHONE

269
00:18:46,162 --> 00:18:51,154
 RIGHT
AFTER YOUR WIFE IS CRUSHED BY
THE GARAGE DOOR OR EQUIVALENT
ACCIDENT.

270
00:18:51,154 --> 00:18:54,314
>> NICK, WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN
TEXTING?

271
00:18:54,314 --> 00:18:56,505
>> WHOOPS.

272
00:18:56,505 --> 00:19:00,946
OVER TO ABBY.
WHAT'S SOMETHING YOUR HUSBAND
HAS ALWAYS WANTED TO KNOW?

273
00:19:00,946 --> 00:19:05,371
>> WELL, I THINK THIS ONE WILL
GET US BACK ON TRACK, IF THERE'S
AN AFTERLIFE.

274
00:19:05,371 --> 00:19:08,308
>> SOUNDS CONFIDENT.
BRIAN SAID --

275
00:19:08,507 --> 00:19:12,132
 WHAT IT FEELS LIKE
TO BE WITH A MAN.

276
00:19:12,132 --> 00:19:15,407
>> WHY WOULD YOU SAY THAT ON TV,
BABE?

277
00:19:15,407 --> 00:19:19,889
>> I DIDN'T KNOW WE HAVE TO SHOW
OUR ANSWERS TO EVERYONE.

278
00:19:19,889 --> 00:19:24,142
>> AND THE GREENS CONTINUE TO BE
ODD BUT PLEASANT PEOPLE.

279
00:19:24,142 --> 00:19:27,730
NEXT QUESTION FOR THE LODIS.
WHAT WAS YOUR BIGGEST FIGHT
ABOUT?

280
00:19:27,730 --> 00:19:31,460
>> OKAY.
I KNOW THIS ONE.
THE HAWAII INCIDENT.

281
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:35,090
>> ALL RIGHT.
NICK SAYS THE HAWAII INCIDENT,
AND NICOLE SAYS

282
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:39,494
 THE TIME WE WERE
IN HAWAII ON TOP OF A WATERFALL
AND I WANTED TO JUMP IN,

283
00:19:39,494 --> 00:19:43,812
 BUT YOU
HELD ME BACK AND WOULDN'T LET ME
DO IT UNTIL THERE WERE OTHER
PEOPLE AROUND.

284
00:19:44,029 --> 00:19:45,781
FIVE POINTS AWAY.

285
00:19:45,781 --> 00:19:48,557
>> THAT'S WHY YOU WOULDN'T LET
ME JUMP?

286
00:19:49,029 --> 00:19:52,178
>> ALL RIGHT.
THAT SOUND MEANS IT'S TIME FOR A
BONUS QUESTION.

287
00:19:52,178 --> 00:19:53,111
THIS ONE'S FOR NICOLE.

288
00:19:53,111 --> 00:19:55,998
WHERE IS A PLACE YOUR HUSBAND
HAS ALWAYS WANTED TO VISIT?

289
00:19:55,998 --> 00:19:58,669
>> I MEAN, I FEEL LIKE I DON'T
EVEN KNOW THIS MAN.

290
00:19:58,669 --> 00:20:02,161
BUT I GUESS HE ALWAYS SAID
DURANGO.

291
00:20:02,161 --> 00:20:11,993
>> YES, BABY, YES.

292
00:20:11,995 --> 00:20:14,028
>> OKAY.

293
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:14,762
FINALLY.

WEEK.

631
00:31:45,321 --> 00:31:46,987
MILLER'S OUT WITH AN ANKLE

632
00:31:46,989 --> 00:31:48,889
SPRAIN, AND ON TUESDAY, COACH

633
00:31:48,891 --> 00:31:50,090
ACCIDENTALLY SENT THAT WEIRD

634
00:31:50,092 --> 00:31:51,825
PICTURE OF HIMSELF TO THE TEAM

635
00:31:51,827 --> 00:31:53,794
GROUP CHAT INSTEAD OF HIS WIFE.

636
00:31:53,796 --> 00:31:55,629
BUT WE GOT TO MOVE PAST THAT.

637
00:31:55,631 --> 00:31:58,832
>> IT'S IN THE PAST, GENTLEMEN.

638
00:31:58,834 --> 00:32:00,567
>> I MEAN, LOOK, DID I WANT TO

639
00:32:00,569 --> 00:32:02,869
SEE COACH WEARING ONLY A FUR

640
00:32:02,871 --> 00:32:05,205
THONG AND CAT EARS ON ALL FOURS

641
00:32:05,207 --> 00:32:08,108
LICKING MILK OUT OF A BOWL?

642
00:32:08,110 --> 00:32:08,709
NO.

643
00:32:08,711 --> 00:32:11,345
BUT THAT'S NO EXCUSE TO NOT PLAY

644
00:32:11,347 --> 00:32:12,312
MY ASS OFF TONIGHT.

645
00:32:12,314 --> 00:32:13,613
>> NO EXCUSE!

646
00:32:13,615 --> 00:32:17,417
>> AND, YEAH, DID IT SUCK THAT

647
00:32:17,419 --> 00:32:21,288
COACH DIDN'T REALIZE WHAT HE HAD

648
00:32:21,290 --> 00:32:23,290
DONE AND SENT EVEN MORE PICTURES

649
00:32:23,292 --> 00:32:24,291
TO THE GROUP?

650
00:32:24,293 --> 00:32:25,425
YES, IT SUCKED.

651
00:32:25,427 --> 00:32:28,161
BUT WE CAN'T BE THINKING ABOUT

652
00:32:28,163 --> 00:32:28,628
THAT RIGHT NOW.

653
00:32:28,630 --> 00:32:29,763
>> IT'S JUST SOMETHING MY WIFE

654
00:32:29,765 --> 00:32:30,797
AND I DO, GENTLEMEN.

655
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:35,669
WE GOT TO MOVE ON FROM THAT.

656
00:32:35,671 --> 00:32:37,137
STOP THINKING ABOUT MY PICS.

657
00:32:37,139 --> 00:32:37,904
>> I'M NOT THINKING ABOUT YOUR

658
00:32:37,906 --> 00:32:38,605
PICS, COACH.

659
00:32:38,607 --> 00:32:42,009
I'M THINKING ABOUT THE VIDEO OF

660
00:32:42,011 --> 00:32:44,978
YOU GOING TO THE BATHROOM IN THE

661
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:45,412
LITTER BOX.

662
00:32:45,414 --> 00:32:45,812
>> ME TOO.

663
00:32:45,814 --> 00:32:47,514
>> IT DOESN'T MATTER WHY COACH'S

664
00:32:47,516 --> 00:32:50,450
WIFE GETS TURNED ON BY THAT, ALL

665
00:32:50,452 --> 00:32:50,817
RIGHT?

666
00:32:50,819 --> 00:32:52,586
SHE LIKES SEEING HIM GO TO THE

667
00:32:52,588 --> 00:32:54,121
BATHROOM IN A LITTER BOX.

668
00:32:54,123 --> 00:32:54,521
THAT'S IT.

669
00:32:54,523 --> 00:32:56,923
>> 26 YEARS OF MARRIAGE, FELLAS.

670
00:32:56,925 --> 00:32:59,092
YOU NEED TO MIX IT UP SOMETIMES.

671
00:32:59,094 --> 00:33:00,293
>> CAN I SAY SOMETHING?

672
00:33:00,295 --> 00:33:02,529
I'M SORRY I POSTED COACH'S VIDEO

673
00:33:02,531 --> 00:33:03,263
ON TIKTOK.

674
00:33:03,265 --> 00:33:04,064
I THOUGHT IT WAS AI.

675
00:33:04,066 --> 00:33:06,199
>> WE KNOW THAT, RODRIGUES.

676
00:33:06,201 --> 00:33:08,168
THE POINT IS NONE OF US HAVE AN

677
00:33:08,170 --> 00:33:10,003
EXCUSE TO BE PLAYING THIS BAD

678
00:33:10,005 --> 00:33:10,737
EXCEPT FOR CHRIS BECAUSE COACH

679
00:33:10,739 --> 00:33:17,711
IS HIS DAD.

680
00:33:17,713 --> 00:33:20,547
>> DON'T YOU WORRY ABOUT MY BOY.

681
00:33:20,549 --> 00:33:21,281
HE'S GOING TO TURN IT ON IN THE

682
00:33:21,283 --> 00:33:24,918
SECOND HALF.

683
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,653
>> SIR, I WANT TO FOCUS.

684
00:33:26,655 --> 00:33:29,523
BUT IT'S KIND OF HARD WHEN THE

685
00:33:29,525 --> 00:33:30,791
OTHER TEAM'S FANS KEEP LIKE

686
00:33:30,793 --> 00:33:32,092
SHINING LASER POINTERS ON THE

687
00:33:32,094 --> 00:33:34,127
FLOOR TRYING TO GET COACH TO

688
00:33:34,129 --> 00:33:34,561
CHASE THEM.

689
00:33:34,563 --> 00:33:38,398
>> WHICH I WON'T.

690
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:40,834
>> SORRY, A PACKAGE HERE FOR

691
00:33:40,836 --> 00:33:41,301
COACH WILLIAMS.

692
00:33:41,303 --> 00:33:42,669
>> MAN, THIS BETTER NOT BE

693
00:33:42,671 --> 00:33:47,007
ANOTHER ONE OF THEM -- IT IS.

694
00:33:47,009 --> 00:33:49,943
KITTY LITTER.

695
00:33:49,945 --> 00:33:51,378
Y'ALL SEE THIS?

696
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:53,780
THIS IS THE OTHER TEAM TRYING TO

697
00:33:53,782 --> 00:33:56,516
GET INTO OUR HEADS, AND IT

698
00:33:56,518 --> 00:33:57,751
WASN'T FUNNY THE FIRST TEN

699
00:33:57,753 --> 00:33:58,051
TIMES.

700
00:33:58,053 --> 00:34:03,590
IT'S NOT FUNNY NOW.

701
00:34:03,592 --> 00:34:04,458
>> LOOK, WE CAN STILL WIN THIS,

702
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:04,858
ALL RIGHT?

703
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:07,861
BUT WE GOT TO PLAY BETTER

704
00:34:07,863 --> 00:34:08,261
DEFENSE.

705
00:34:08,263 --> 00:34:10,063
SO WHOEVER YOU'RE COVERING, BE

706
00:34:10,065 --> 00:34:10,697
ON THEM.

707
00:34:10,699 --> 00:34:13,100
WHEREVER THEY GO, JUST FOLLOW

708
00:34:13,102 --> 00:34:13,600
THEM.

709
00:34:13,602 --> 00:34:15,635
JUST LIKE HOW WHEREVER THE COACH

710
00:34:15,637 --> 00:34:18,772
GOES, THE STATE APPOINTED SOCIAL

711
00:34:18,774 --> 00:34:19,206
WORKER GOES.

712
00:34:19,208 --> 00:34:20,240
>> DON'T MIND ME.

713
00:34:20,242 --> 00:34:21,975
JUST MAKING SURE EVERYBODY FEELS

714
00:34:21,977 --> 00:34:22,275
SAFE.

715
00:34:22,277 --> 00:34:23,877
>> GUYS, WHAT IS COACH FAMOUS

716
00:34:23,879 --> 00:34:25,112
FOR SAYING?

717
00:34:25,114 --> 00:34:26,847
>> THIS NAUGHTY KITTY CRAVES

718
00:34:26,849 --> 00:34:29,015
DISCIPLINE.

719
00:34:29,017 --> 00:34:32,519
>> NO, NOT FROM THE CAT VIDEOS.

720
00:34:32,521 --> 00:34:35,288
FROM WHAT HE SAYS IN PRACTICE.

721
00:34:35,290 --> 00:34:37,991
>> OH, PLAY THE GAME, NOT THE

722
00:34:37,993 --> 00:34:38,291
SCORE.

723
00:34:38,293 --> 00:34:39,593
>> EXACTLY.

724
00:34:39,595 --> 00:34:42,729
SO WHEN WE GO OUT THERE FOR THE

725
00:34:42,731 --> 00:34:43,497
SECOND HALF, LET'S SHOW UP JUST

726
00:34:43,499 --> 00:34:45,232
LIKE COACH SHOWED UP FOR US

727
00:34:45,234 --> 00:34:46,199
TODAY EVEN THOUGH ALL OF OUR

728
00:34:46,201 --> 00:34:48,268
PARENTS ASKED HIM NOT TO.

729
00:34:48,270 --> 00:34:51,304
>> THANK YOU, NATE.

730
00:34:51,306 --> 00:34:53,039
YOU KNOW, GENTLEMEN, I'M GOING

731
00:34:53,041 --> 00:34:55,108
TO BE REAL WITH YOU.

732
00:34:55,110 --> 00:34:58,245
WHEN I REALIZED WHAT I HAD DONE,

733
00:34:58,247 --> 00:34:59,813
I CONSIDERED GETTING INTO MY CAR

734
00:34:59,815 --> 00:35:02,415
AND DRIVING OFF TO START A NEW

735
00:35:02,417 --> 00:35:04,050
LIFE SOMEWHERE ELSE, BUT I

736
00:35:04,052 --> 00:35:04,651
COULDN'T LEAVE MY TEAM.

737
00:35:04,653 --> 00:35:06,586
COULDN'T LEAVE MY SON.

738
00:35:06,588 --> 00:35:07,921
AND I KNOW THAT ONE DAY, HE'S

739
00:35:07,923 --> 00:35:10,790
GOING TO EVENTUALLY TALK AGAIN.

740
00:35:10,792 --> 00:35:13,026
AND WHEN HE DOES, THE FIRST

741
00:35:13,028 --> 00:35:14,694
WORDS OUT OF HIS MOUTH ARE NOT

742
00:35:14,696 --> 00:35:16,663
GOING TO BE, DAD, I WANT TO GO

743
00:35:16,665 --> 00:35:18,598
LIVE WITH GRANDMA AND GRANDPA.

744
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:21,134
THEY'RE GOING TO BE, DAD, WE'RE

745
00:35:21,136 --> 00:35:22,569
STATE CHAMPIONS.

746
00:35:22,571 --> 00:35:23,803
NOW LET'S GET OUT THERE AND GET

747
00:35:23,805 --> 00:35:25,272
THIS WIN AND MAKE SOME

748
00:35:25,274 --> 00:35:25,639
HEADLINES.

749
00:35:25,641 --> 00:35:33,346
>> YEAH!

750
00:35:24,899 --> 00:35:29,089
KIDS, YOU'RE GOING TO BE LATE FOR
SCHOOL.

751
00:35:29,089 --> 00:35:32,684
YOU KNOW, FASTING FOR RAMADAN
USED TO BE EASY, 

752
00:35:32,684 --> 00:35:35,807
BUT THE LAST
FEW YEARS WITH WORK AND A
GROWING FAMILY, 

753
00:35:35,807 --> 00:35:37,668
IT'S FELT ALMOST
IMPOSSIBLE.

754
00:35:37,668 --> 00:35:39,997
BUT NOT ANYMORE. THANKS TO

755
00:35:39,997 --> 00:35:42,512
 OZEMPIC FOR RAMADAN.

756
00:35:44,750 --> 00:35:49,053
>> OZEMPIC IS A MEDICATION
PRESCRIBED TO SUPPRESS HUNGER
AND SLOW DIGESTION, 

757
00:35:49,053 --> 00:35:54,685
AND RAMADAN
IS A MONTH WHERE MUSLIMS SUSTAIN
FROM FOOD AND WATER FROM SUNRISE
TO SUNSET.

758
00:35:54,685 --> 00:35:57,186
>> I USED TO RUSH TO EAT A WHOLE
MEAL BEFORE DAWN.

759
00:35:57,186 --> 00:36:01,046
NOW I JUST GRAB MY PRAYER BEADS
AND OZEMPIC NEEDLES.

760
00:36:01,046 --> 00:36:05,306
AS LONG AS I SHOOT UP BEFORE THE
SUN RISES, IT'S HALAL.

761
00:36:07,388 --> 00:36:18,091
>> SINCE MY GR DOCTOR PRESCRIBED

762
00:36:18,093 --> 00:36:20,293
OZEMPIC FOR RAMADAN, I'VE NEVER

763
00:36:20,295 --> 00:36:21,595
GOTTEN MORE WORK DONE.

764
00:36:21,597 --> 00:36:24,564
WHILE MY COWORKERS ARE AT LUNCH,

765
00:36:24,566 --> 00:36:26,700
I'M ON GOOGLE SHEETS GOING HAM.

766
00:36:26,702 --> 00:36:28,902
>> RUNNING MY FOOD CART DURING

767
00:36:28,904 --> 00:36:31,304
RAMADAN IS REALLY HARD, SMELLING

768
00:36:31,306 --> 00:36:34,674
ALL MY DELICIOUS MEATS AND 48

769
00:36:34,676 --> 00:36:36,476
HOUR MARINADES ON MY BUTTER

770
00:36:36,478 --> 00:36:39,045
GRILL -- WITH OZEMPIC FOR

771
00:36:39,047 --> 00:36:41,181
RAMADAN, NOW I DON'T EVEN GET

772
00:36:41,183 --> 00:36:44,117
HANGRY WHEN WHITE WOMEN ASK IF I

773
00:36:44,119 --> 00:36:44,551
HAVE SALMON.

774
00:36:44,553 --> 00:36:47,787
>> SIDE EFFECTS MAY INCLUDE

775
00:36:47,789 --> 00:36:50,890
NAUSEA, HEADACHE, AND GOING

776
00:36:50,892 --> 00:36:51,424
STRAIGHT TO HELL.

777
00:36:51,426 --> 00:36:53,860
>> I'VE ALWAYS LOVED THE SOUND

778
00:36:53,862 --> 00:36:56,563
OF CAB DRIVERS YELLING ON THEIR

779
00:36:56,565 --> 00:36:58,898
PHONE IN ISLAMIC, AND IT MADE ME

780
00:36:58,900 --> 00:36:59,699
WANT TO CONVERT.

781
00:36:59,701 --> 00:37:02,702
THE ONLY THING HOLDING ME BACK

782
00:37:02,704 --> 00:37:03,136
WAS FASTING.

783
00:37:03,138 --> 00:37:04,904
BUT NOW I CAN WALK INTO THE

784
00:37:04,906 --> 00:37:07,073
MOSQUE WITH A FULL HEART AND A

785
00:37:07,075 --> 00:37:08,308
27-INCH WAIST.

786
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:08,575
BAM!

787
00:37:08,577 --> 00:37:11,444
>> OZEMPIC FOR RAMADAN HAS ALL

788
00:37:11,446 --> 00:37:14,581
THE MIRACULOUS HUNGER-CRUSHING

789
00:37:14,583 --> 00:37:16,483
INGREDIENTS THAT REGULAR OZEMPIC

790
00:37:16,485 --> 00:37:17,617
HAS WITHOUT ANY PORK.

791
00:37:17,619 --> 00:37:19,886
>> WHEN IT'S FINALLY TIME TO

792
00:37:19,888 --> 00:37:21,721
EAT, I'M NOT EVEN HUNGRY.

793
00:37:21,723 --> 00:37:23,356
I THINK I'M GOING TO FAST THE

794
00:37:23,358 --> 00:37:24,391
WHOLE MONTH STRAIGHT.

SO, BASED ON THE STATE OF THE
