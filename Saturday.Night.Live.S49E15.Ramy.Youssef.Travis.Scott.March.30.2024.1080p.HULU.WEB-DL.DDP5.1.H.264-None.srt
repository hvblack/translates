1
00:00:00,614 --> 00:00:04,359
>>> EASTER, THE CELEBRATION OF
THE REBIRTH OF CHRIST.

2
00:00:04,359 --> 00:00:08,304
THE BIBLE TELLS US THAT THREE
DAYS AFTER THE CRUCIFIXION OF JESUS,

3
00:00:08,304 --> 00:00:09,889
HE ROSE FROM THE DEAD.

4
00:00:09,889 --> 00:00:12,856
THE FIRST TO WITNESS THIS
MIRACLE WERE THREE WOMEN

5
00:00:12,856 --> 00:00:16,801
WHO HAD
COME TO ANOINT THE BODY OF JESUS
AND TEND TO HIS TOMB.

6
00:00:16,801 --> 00:00:21,498
THIS IS THE STORY OF THE
RESURRECTION.

7
00:00:31,144 --> 00:00:35,164
>>> THIS IS IT, THE TOMB WHERE
HIS BODY IS LAID.

8
00:00:35,164 --> 00:00:37,028
>> MOTHER MARY, DRY YOUR TEARS.

9
00:00:37,028 --> 00:00:39,442
MARY AND I ARE HERE TO SUPPORT
YOU.

10
00:00:39,442 --> 00:00:42,932
>> MARY IS RIGHT.
ALSO, WHEN WE'RE DONE GRIEVING,

11
00:00:42,932 --> 00:00:47,198
MAYBE WE SHOULD COME UP WITH A
GIRL'S NAME OTHER THAN MARY.

12
00:00:48,234 --> 00:00:51,150
>> WHAT IS THAT NOISE THAT COMES
FROM WITHIN?

13
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:54,234
>> LOOK, THE STONE, IT ROLLS
AWAY.

14
00:00:54,234 --> 00:00:56,462
>> IS IT JESUS?

15
00:00:56,939 --> 00:00:59,556
>> BASICALLY, YES.

16
00:01:04,416 --> 00:01:06,627
HAPPY EASTER, EVERYBODY.

17
00:01:06,627 --> 00:01:09,625
AS IT WAS STATED IN THE BIBLE,
GUESS WHO'S BACK,

18
00:01:09,625 --> 00:01:12,283
BACK AGAIN,
SHADY'S BACK.

19
00:01:12,516 --> 00:01:14,312
ALL RIGHT, GIRLS.
YOU CAN GO.

20
00:01:14,312 --> 00:01:16,245
NO MORE LINES.
YOU DID GREAT.

21
00:01:16,245 --> 00:01:18,074
BYE BYE.

22
00:01:18,727 --> 00:01:21,028
GET OUT OF HERE.

23
00:01:21,028 --> 00:01:22,886
THAT'S RIGHT. IT'S EASTER,

24
00:01:22,886 --> 00:01:26,790
THE TIME OF YEAR
WHEN I COMPARE MYSELF TO JESUS
CHRIST.

25
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:28,380
THAT'S JUST A THING I DO NOW,

26
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:31,358
AND PEOPLE SEEM TO BE OKAY WITH
IT.
I'M GOING TO KEEP DOING IT.

27
00:01:31,358 --> 00:01:33,496
IF YOU THINK THIS IS A BAD LOOK,

28
00:01:33,496 --> 00:01:36,803
IMAGINE HOW WEIRD IT WOULD BE IF
I STARTED SELLING BIBLES.

29
00:01:36,803 --> 00:01:41,015
WELL, I'M SELLING BIBLES.

30
00:01:41,015 --> 00:01:46,445
LOOK AT THIS BEAUTIFUL BIBLE
MADE FROM 100% BIBLE.

31
00:01:46,445 --> 00:01:51,005
SOUNDS LIKE A JOKE, AND IN MANY
WAYS IT IS, BUT IT'S ALSO VERY
REAL.

32
00:01:51,005 --> 00:01:55,242
AS YOU KNOW, I LOVE BIBLE.
IT'S MY FAVORITE BOOK.

33
00:01:55,242 --> 00:01:57,331
I'VE DEFINITELY READ IT.

34
00:01:57,331 --> 00:02:00,529
MY FAVORITE PART IS PROBABLY THE ENDING,

35
00:02:00,529 --> 00:02:02,905
HOW IT ALL WRAPS UP.

36
00:02:02,905 --> 00:02:05,476
BUT THIS IS A VERY SPECIAL
BIBLE.

37
00:02:05,476 --> 00:02:09,439
AND IT CAN BE YOURS FOR THE
HIGH, HIGH PRICE OF $60.

38
00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:12,143
BUT I'M NOT DOING THIS FOR THE
MONEY.

39
00:02:12,143 --> 00:02:15,681
I'M DOING THIS FOR THE GLORY OF GOD

40
00:02:15,681 --> 00:02:19,790
AND FOR PANDERING AND MOSTLY
FOR MONEY.

41
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:25,320
BUT IT'S SO SAD.
RELIGION AND CHRISTIANITY ARE
TOTALLY GONE FROM THIS COUNTRY,

42
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,438
AND WE NEED THEM BACK.

43
00:02:26,438 --> 00:02:30,664
WITHOUT RELIGION, YOU DON'T HAVE
LAWS, YOU DON'T HAVE MISSION
TRIPS.

44
00:02:30,664 --> 00:02:32,767
I'M TOLD MISSION TRIPS ARE A LOT
OF FUN.

45
00:02:32,767 --> 00:02:34,281
YOU GO TO MEXICO, BUILD A HOUSE,

46
00:02:34,281 --> 00:02:37,199
MAYBE MAKE OUT WITH SOMEONE ON
THE LAST NIGHT.

47
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:41,582
THEN IT'S BACK TO CLEAR WATER,
FLORIDA LIKE IT NEVER HAPPENED.

48
00:02:41,582 --> 00:02:46,788
BUT YOU'RE GOING TO LOVE MY NEW
AND EVEN BETTER BIBLE.

49
00:02:46,788 --> 00:02:49,253
IT COMES WITH EVERYTHING YOU
LIKE FROM BIBLE,

50
00:02:49,253 --> 00:02:51,828
LIKE THE STORY OF EASTER,

51
00:02:51,828 --> 00:02:55,402
WHICH PRIMARILY
CONCERNS JESUS, NOT SO MUCH THE
BUNNY.

52
00:02:55,402 --> 00:02:57,949
CAN'T WAIT
THE BUNNY NEVER SHOWED UP.

53
00:02:57,949 --> 00:02:59,279
THAT'S OKAY.

54
00:02:59,279 --> 00:03:03,787
NOW, MY BIBLE ALSO INCLUDES SOME
BEAUTIFUL ILLUSTRATIONS

55
00:03:03,787 --> 00:03:06,962
LIKE
MOSES FLOATING DOWN THE RIVER IN
THE BASKET,

56
00:03:06,962 --> 00:03:10,584
AND UH-OH, LOOK OUT,
HERE'S TRUMP IN THE BASKET.

57
00:03:10,584 --> 00:03:13,812
RIGHT BEHIND MOSES ABOUT TO PASS
ON THE LEFT.

58
00:03:13,812 --> 00:03:20,106
AND HERE I AM IN THE GARDEN OF
EDEN WITH MY ACTUAL BODY.

59
00:03:20,106 --> 00:03:23,487
YOU KNOW, I THINK I WOULD BE
VERY GOOD AT SAYING NO TO THE SNAKE

60
00:03:23,487 --> 00:03:26,986
FROM THE STANDPOINT OF NOT
LIKING FRUIT.

61
00:03:26,986 --> 00:03:32,326
AND HERE'S NOAH'S ARK, ALL THE
ANIMALS ARE ON THE ARK OF
COURSE.

62
00:03:32,326 --> 00:03:37,111
THERE'S ME YELLING AT NOAH, HEY,
BUDDY, YOU FORGOT THE RACCOON.

63
00:03:37,177 --> 00:03:40,793
BUT WE LOVE RELIGION, AND WE
LOVE GOD.

64
00:03:40,793 --> 00:03:43,941
HE'S PROBABLY THE BEST PART OF
THE HOLY TRINITY.

65
00:03:43,941 --> 00:03:47,334
HE'S LIKE THE BEYONCE.
COWBOY CARTER.

66
00:03:48,685 --> 00:03:53,335
GOD'S THE BEYONCE, JESUS IS THE
KELLY ROWLAND,

67
00:03:53,335 --> 00:03:56,994
AND HOLY GHOST
WOULD PROBABLY BE THE BLACK MICHELLE WILLIAMS

68
00:03:56,994 --> 00:03:59,570
WHO'S VERY
IMPORTANT TO A GREAT NUMBER OF
PEOPLE.

69
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:05,384
ALMOST AS IMPORTANT AS THE WHITE
MICHELLE WILLIAMS IS TO WHITE
PEOPLE.

70
00:04:05,384 --> 00:04:08,315
AND WE BELIEVE THERE WAS A
FOURTH DESTINY CHILD,

71
00:04:08,315 --> 00:04:10,426
BUT WE'LL
BE LOOKING INTO THAT VERY
STRONGLY.

72
00:04:10,426 --> 00:04:12,599
VERY SHORTLY.

73
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:15,724
BILLS, BILLS, BILLS, THAT'S A
GOOD ONE.
I LIKE THAT ONE.

74
00:04:15,724 --> 00:04:19,567
I WOULD LOVE SOMEONE TO PAY
MINE.
ANY TAKERS?

75
00:04:19,567 --> 00:04:20,857
NO.

76
00:04:20,857 --> 00:04:23,022
WELL, BACK TO MY BEAUTIFUL BIBLE,

77
00:04:23,022 --> 00:04:28,686
 WHICH ALSO INCLUDES
CONSTITUTION AND PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE, 

78
00:04:28,686 --> 00:04:32,392
AND -- I DON'T KNOW,
MAYBE MIRANDA RIGHTS,

79
00:04:32,392 --> 00:04:35,920
 WHICH
MEANS UNFORTUNATELY WE HAD TO
MAKE SOME CUTS.

80
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:39,875
THIS BIBLE WILL NOT FEATURE AMOS
OR HABAKKUK.

81
00:04:39,875 --> 00:04:45,281
SORRY, HABAKKUK, BUT NOW I THINK
IT REALLY COOKS.
IT'S TIGHT.

82
00:04:45,281 --> 00:04:50,759
AND IF YOU ORDER NOW, WE'LL ALSO
THROW IN A FREE TRUMP MIRACLE
TOASTER.

83
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:56,156
YOU KNOW HOW SOMETIMES WEIRDOS
SEE A PICTURE OF JESUS OR
SOMETHING IN THEIR TOAST?

84
00:04:56,156 --> 00:04:58,959
WELL, HOW ABOUT THE MIRACLE OF
TRUMP?

85
00:04:58,959 --> 00:05:03,235
AND THIS IS GREAT.
THE OTHER SIDE DOES HELLO KITTY

86
00:05:03,235 --> 00:05:08,740
IF YOU HAVE A DAUGHTER OR
PERHAPS A SON WHO'S TAKING DANCE
CLASSES.

87
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:11,179
ANYWAY, IT'S EASTER EVE, 

88
00:05:11,179 --> 00:05:14,349
SO LET US BOW OUR HEADS -- I'M NOT
GOING TO -- 

89
00:05:14,349 --> 00:05:19,850
AND SAY THE LORD'S
PRAYER, WHICH WE ALL KNOW VERY
WELL, ME ESPECIALLY.

90
00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:23,465
OUR FATHER WHO ARE IN HEAVEN,

91
00:05:23,532 --> 00:05:25,369
HALLOWED

92
00:05:28,452 --> 00:05:31,489
 TRESPASS, DAILY BREAD, 

93
00:05:31,489 --> 00:05:35,332
AND PLEASE LEAD US INTO
TEMPTATION, 

94
00:05:35,332 --> 00:05:38,469
AND PAY OUR
AUTOMOBILES.

95
00:05:38,469 --> 00:05:43,483
IN THE NAME OF FATHER, THE SON,
AND THE EASTER BUNNY, AMEN, 

96
00:05:43,483 --> 00:05:47,107
AND
LIVE FROM NEW YORK, IT'S
SATURDAY NIGHT!

97
00:07:53,631 --> 00:07:58,514
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, RAMY
YOUSSEF!

98
00:08:23,094 --> 00:08:28,172
SPIRITUAL WEEKEND 

99
00:08:28,172 --> 00:08:30,842
WE'RE IN THE HOLY MONTH OF
RAMADAN.

100
00:08:32,818 --> 00:08:34,896
TOMORROW IS EASTER.

101
00:08:34,896 --> 00:08:38,715
AND YESTERDAY, BEYONCE RELEASED
A NEW ALBUM.

102
00:08:38,715 --> 00:08:44,097
THERE'S JUST SO MANY RELIGIONS
CELEBRATING ALL AT ONCE.

103
00:08:44,097 --> 00:08:46,958
I'M DOING THE RAMADAN ONE.

104
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:51,586
I LOVE RAMADAN BECAUSE I LOVE
HANGING OUT WITH MUSLIMS.
WE'RE SO LOVING.

105
00:08:51,586 --> 00:08:53,730
AND I FEEL LIKE PEOPLE DON'T
KNOW THAT ABOUT US.

106
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:56,981
THEY KNOW ALL THESE OTHER
THINGS, BUT MAN, WE LOVE TO
LOVE.

107
00:08:56,981 --> 00:08:58,572
WE'RE SO FREE WITH IT.

108
00:08:58,637 --> 00:09:02,255
MY FRIENDS THAT I GREW UP WITH,
THEY WERE REALLY WEIRD ABOUT
LOVE.

109
00:09:02,255 --> 00:09:06,411
I HAVE A BUDDY OF MINE WHO WAS
LIKE, MAN, I'VE BEEN HANGING OUT
WITH THIS GIRL, DUDE, 

110
00:09:06,411 --> 00:09:11,664
AND I TOLD
HER I LOVED HER.
IT'S ONLY BEEN NINE MONTHS.

111
00:09:11,664 --> 00:09:16,534
I WAS LIKE, DUDE, I JUST SAID
THAT TO MY UBER DRIVER.

112
00:09:16,534 --> 00:09:21,093
I GAVE HIM MY NUMBER.
I WAS LIKE, BRO, LET'S GET OFF
THE APP.

113
00:09:21,093 --> 00:09:25,433
I WANT TO GET TO KNOW YOU.
YOU MEAN SOMETHING TO ME.

114
00:09:25,433 --> 00:09:28,378
NINE MONTHS?
YOU SHOULD HAVE A KID.

115
00:09:28,378 --> 00:09:30,405
IT'S TOO MUCH.

116
00:09:30,405 --> 00:09:33,871
AND PEOPLE DON'T GET US, AND
THERE'S ALL THIS DIVISION, BUT
IT'S NOT WHERE YOU THINK IT IS.

117
00:09:33,871 --> 00:09:35,788
SO I LIVE IN NEW YORK.
WE'RE IN THIS BUBBLE.

118
00:09:35,788 --> 00:09:38,860
WE THINK EVERYTHING WE DISAGREE
WITH IS IN THE SOUTH.

119
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:42,916
BUT I DON'T BELIEVE IN THE
SOUTH.

120
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:44,810
THERE IS NO SOUTH.

121
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:49,533
LIKE, THE SOUTH IS 45 MINUTES
AWAY FROM WHEREVER YOU ARE.

122
00:09:49,889 --> 00:09:52,235
I HAD A SHOW IN UPSTATE NEW
YORK.

123
00:09:52,235 --> 00:09:54,144
I WAS WALKING THROUGH THE
NEIGHBORHOOD.

124
00:09:54,144 --> 00:09:57,891
THERE'S ALL THIS TRUMP STUFF,
FLAGS, RED HATS,

125
00:09:57,891 --> 00:10:01,665
 I WAS LIKE, YO,
I WENT NORTH, 

126
00:10:01,665 --> 00:10:04,159
BUT I'M SOUTH.

127
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:07,178
AND I COULD FEEL IT, YOU KNOW, I
COULD FEEL THE FEAR.

128
00:10:07,178 --> 00:10:09,656
WHEN MY MOM CALLED ME, I DIDN'T
WANT TO SPEAK ARABIC.

129
00:10:09,657 --> 00:10:11,345
SALAM

130
00:10:11,345 --> 00:10:15,125
I WAS LIKE, MOTHER, PEACE BE
UPON YOU.
LIKE, I --

131
00:10:15,125 --> 00:10:20,557
 YOU KNOW, AND THE
PROFIT, YOU KNOW WHICH PROFIT.

132
00:10:20,557 --> 00:10:23,767
THE BEST ONE, THE LAST ONE.

133
00:10:27,802 --> 00:10:30,830
IT'S TOUGH BECAUSE IT'S AN
ELECTION YEAR.

134
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:33,433
THAT'S WHEN YOU CAN FEEL IT.
EVERYONE'S FREAKING OUT.

135
00:10:33,433 --> 00:10:37,972
FOR ME, WHERE I'M AT NOW, I KNOW
BIDEN'S GOING TO CALL.

136
00:10:37,972 --> 00:10:41,544
CALL
HE'LL PROBABLY FORGET.

137
00:10:41,544 --> 00:10:45,017
BUT I THINK SOMEBODY WILL CALL.

138
00:10:45,017 --> 00:10:49,646
LIKE IN 2020, I GOT A CALL FROM
MUHAMMAD AT BIDEN.

139
00:10:49,646 --> 00:10:53,283
YOU KNOW THEY THOUGHT THAT WAS
SO COOL.

140
00:10:53,283 --> 00:10:58,468
LIKE BEN WAS GOING TO CALL, AND
THEY WERE LIKE, NO, NO, LET
MUHAMMAD DO IT.

141
00:10:58,468 --> 00:11:01,979
RAMY'S GOING TO LIKE THAT
ENERGY.

142
00:11:01,979 --> 00:11:04,620
HE GOES, RAMY, WE LOVE YOU.

143
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:08,129
WE LOVE EVERYTHING THAT YOU'VE
DONE FOR ARAB AMERICA.

144
00:11:08,129 --> 00:11:11,050
HE SAID IT LIKE IT WAS A
COUNTRY.

145
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:15,304
HE GOES, EVERYONE ON THE
CAMPAIGN IS SUCH A BIG FAN OF
YOUR WORK.

146
00:11:15,304 --> 00:11:17,833
AND JOE'S AWARE, RIGHT.

147
00:11:17,833 --> 00:11:22,216
THAT'S HUGE, RIGHT, BECAUSE JOE
HAS AN AWARENESS ISSUE.

148
00:11:22,216 --> 00:11:26,587
I MEAN, JOE'S AWARE.
THAT'S LIKE A NOBEL PEACE PRIZE.

149
00:11:26,587 --> 00:11:29,964
WE SAID YOUR NAME, JOE WAS
NODDING.

150
00:11:29,964 --> 00:11:33,284
JOE LOOKS GOOD WHEN HE'S AWARE.
YOU'VE SEEN HIM, RIGHT?

151
00:11:33,284 --> 00:11:37,938
YOU KNOW THOSE DAYS WHEN HE
COMES OUT AND HE'S JUST LIKE
THAWED.

152
00:11:38,733 --> 00:11:43,212
THEY GIVE HIM AN EXTRA TEN IN
THE MICROWAVE.
HE'S JUST LIT UP.

153
00:11:43,212 --> 00:11:46,056
HE LOOKS GOOD.
AND HE SAYS STUFF THAT'S
INSPIRING.

154
00:11:46,056 --> 00:11:49,207
IT DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING, BUT
IT'S GOOD.

155
00:11:49,207 --> 00:11:51,895
HE'LL BE LIKE, I RIDE THE TRAIN.

156
00:11:51,895 --> 00:11:54,956
YOU'RE LIKE, SICK, WHERE'S IT
GOING.

157
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:58,693
AND YOU NEVER FIND OUT.

158
00:11:59,138 --> 00:12:03,373
BUT MUHAMMAD GOES TO ME, RAMY,
LISTEN, THIS IS A TOUGH
ELECTION.

159
00:12:03,373 --> 00:12:06,720
THERE'S A LOT OF BATTLEGROUNDS,

160
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:11,327
BUT WE'VE REALIZED IF WE CAN WIN
JUST ONE, WE'LL GET THE WHOLE
COUNTRY.

161
00:12:11,327 --> 00:12:15,693
THE ONLY STATE WE NEED IS
MICHIGAN.

162
00:12:15,693 --> 00:12:18,392
ARAB AMERICA.

163
00:12:18,392 --> 00:12:21,128
HE GOES, RAMY, GO TO MICHIGAN.

164
00:12:21,128 --> 00:12:24,142
TELL THE ARABS TO VOTE FOR JOE,

165
00:12:24,142 --> 00:12:27,335
AND YOU COULD CHANGE THE COURSE
OF AMERICAN HISTORY.

166
00:12:27,335 --> 00:12:30,805
AND OUR COUNTRY'S SO MESSED UP
THAT FOR FIVE MINUTES, I WAS LIKE, 

167
00:12:30,805 --> 00:12:33,364
IS THIS UP TO ME?

168
00:12:34,403 --> 00:12:36,867
LIKE AM I THE GUY?

169
00:12:36,867 --> 00:12:40,436
I HAD THIS FANTASY, RIGHT.
LIKE I'M IN MICHIGAN.

170
00:12:40,436 --> 00:12:52,287
I'M IN EVERY VAPE SHOP.

171
00:12:52,289 --> 00:12:54,589
AND IT'S JUST LIKE, BRO, BRO,

172
00:12:54,591 --> 00:12:58,660
JOE, JOE.

173
00:12:58,662 --> 00:13:00,295
BUT I COULDN'T GO.

174
00:13:00,297 --> 00:13:01,963
I COULDN'T GO.

175
00:13:01,965 --> 00:13:03,631
I DON'T LIKE EITHER OPTION TO BE

176
00:13:03,633 --> 00:13:04,632
HONEST WITH YOU.

177
00:13:04,634 --> 00:13:06,301
I REALLY THINK OUR NEXT

178
00:13:06,303 --> 00:13:07,068
PRESIDENT SHOULD BE A WOMAN.

179
00:13:07,070 --> 00:13:08,403
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

180
00:13:08,405 --> 00:13:10,672
LIKE THAT WOULD BE AMAZING.

181
00:13:11,274 --> 00:13:12,407
I THINK OUR NEXT PRESIDENT

182
00:13:12,409 --> 00:13:17,545
SHOULD BE A TRANSWOMAN.

183
00:13:17,547 --> 00:13:19,481
A LITTLE LESS SUPPORT, YEAH.

184
00:13:19,483 --> 00:13:21,249
THAT'S NEW YORK, RIGHT?

185
00:13:21,251 --> 00:13:22,584
NEW YORK'S LIKE WE'RE LIBERAL,

186
00:13:22,586 --> 00:13:23,718
BUT WE'RE ITALIAN.

187
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:28,156
WATCH OUT.

188
00:13:28,158 --> 00:13:28,423
NO.

189
00:13:28,425 --> 00:13:29,557
I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT HER.

190
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:30,792
I REALLY HAVE.

191
00:13:30,794 --> 00:13:32,126
LIKE IMAGINE HER SPEECH.

192
00:13:32,128 --> 00:13:34,262
IT WOULD BE SO INSPIRING.

193
00:13:34,264 --> 00:13:36,698
SHE WOULD BE LIKE, A LOT OF

194
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:42,303
POLITICIANS TALK ABOUT CHANGE --

195
00:13:42,706 --> 00:13:44,239
#ИМЯ?

196
00:13:44,241 --> 00:13:46,875
STICKER, RIGHT, LIKE REAL

197
00:13:46,877 --> 00:13:47,208
CHANGE.

198
00:13:47,210 --> 00:13:48,877
SHE PUTS UP A BEFORE AND AFTER.

199
00:13:48,879 --> 00:13:49,677
SHE'S LIKE, I CAN DO THAT TO THE

200
00:13:49,679 --> 00:13:56,351
COUNTRY.

201
00:13:56,353 --> 00:13:57,919
IT'S JUST AN IDEA.

202
00:13:57,921 --> 00:13:59,220
I'M OUT OF IDEAS.

203
00:13:59,222 --> 00:14:00,154
I REALLY AM.

204
00:14:00,156 --> 00:14:01,956
I'M OUT OF IDEAS.

205
00:14:01,958 --> 00:14:03,224
ALL I HAVE ARE PRAYERS.

206
00:14:03,226 --> 00:14:05,660
THAT'S ALL I CAN DO RIGHT NOW.

207
00:14:05,662 --> 00:14:07,795
AND IN MY FRIEND GROUP, I'M ONE

208
00:14:07,797 --> 00:14:09,764
OF THE ONLY GUYS WHO PRAYS.

209
00:14:09,766 --> 00:14:12,000
I'M FRIENDS WITH A LOT OF

210
00:14:12,002 --> 00:14:12,333
SINNERS.

211
00:14:12,335 --> 00:14:14,235
LIKE JUST DISGUSTING PEOPLE.

212
00:14:14,237 --> 00:14:17,272
AND THEY CALL ME WHEN THEY'RE IN

213
00:14:17,274 --> 00:14:18,072
TROUBLE BECAUSE THEY WANT ME TO

214
00:14:18,074 --> 00:14:19,040
PRAY FOR THEM.

215
00:14:19,042 --> 00:14:22,176
SO I GET A CALL FROM MY BUDDY

216
00:14:22,178 --> 00:14:22,477
BRIAN.

217
00:14:22,479 --> 00:14:23,311
HE'S STRESSED.

218
00:14:23,313 --> 00:14:25,980
HE'S BEEN IN COURT FOR TEN HAD

219
00:14:25,982 --> 00:14:27,448
MONTHS WITH HIS EX, AND THEY'RE

220
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:28,650
FIGHTING OVER THE DOG.

221
00:14:28,652 --> 00:14:32,687
HE GOES, DUDE, SHE DOESN'T TAKE

222
00:14:32,689 --> 00:14:33,154
CARE OF THE DOG.

223
00:14:33,156 --> 00:14:37,458
SHE FEEDS HIM KIBBLE, NOT WET

224
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:39,460
FOOD.

225
00:14:39,462 --> 00:14:39,928
I NEED HIM BACK.

226
00:14:39,930 --> 00:14:41,262
IT'S JUST DESTROYING MY LIFE.

227
00:14:41,264 --> 00:14:42,964
PLEASE PRAY FOR ME.

228
00:14:42,966 --> 00:14:43,965
I NEED HIM.

I'M LIKE, I GOT YOU.

AN HOUR GOES BY.

231
00:14:47,804 --> 00:14:50,538
I GOT A FRIEND ACHMED CALLING

232
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:50,805

233
00:14:50,807 --> 00:14:54,642
HIS WHOLE FAMILY IS IN GAZA, AND

234
00:14:54,644 --> 00:14:55,777
HE GOES, RAMY, THEY'RE

235
00:14:55,779 --> 00:14:56,144
SUFFERING.

236
00:14:56,146 --> 00:14:57,245
I DON'T KNOW WHERE HALF OF THEM

237
00:14:57,247 --> 00:14:57,512
ARE.

238
00:14:57,514 --> 00:14:58,713
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

239
00:14:58,715 --> 00:14:59,781
PLEASE PRAY FOR THEM.

240
00:14:59,783 --> 00:15:01,616
IT'S THE ONLY THING WE CAN DO.

241
00:15:01,618 --> 00:15:03,484
I'M LIKE, DUDE, I GOT YOU.

242
00:15:03,486 --> 00:15:05,787
SO THAT NIGHT, I GO TO PRAY, AND

243
00:15:05,789 --> 00:15:10,725
MY PRAYERS ARE COMPLICATED.

00:15:10,727 --> 00:15:13,361
I'VE GOT A LOT TO FIT IN.

245
00:15:13,363 --> 00:15:16,497
I'M LIKE, GOD, PLEASE, PLEASE

246
00:15:16,499 --> 00:15:18,166

247
00:15:18,168 --> 00:15:19,500
PLEASE STOP THE SUFFERING.

248
00:15:19,502 --> 00:15:23,671

FEAR?

>> WELL, NOT SURE HE WANTS

308
00:17:50,954 --> 00:17:52,954
PEOPLE TO KNOW THIS ONE, BUT

309
00:17:52,956 --> 00:17:54,188
IT'S DEFINITELY HEIGHTS.

310
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:54,722
>> OKAY.

311
00:17:54,724 --> 00:17:56,657
SHE SAYS HEIGHTS, AND NICK SAYS

312
00:17:56,659 --> 00:18:00,862
HIS GREATEST FEAR IS -- THAT

313
00:18:00,864 --> 00:18:02,163
YOU'LL DIE IN A BIZARRE ACCIDENT

314
00:18:02,165 --> 00:18:03,731
AND EVEN THOUGH I HAD NOTHING TO

315
00:18:03,733 --> 00:18:05,500
DO WITH IT, THE POLICE WILL

316
00:18:05,502 --> 00:18:07,935
ASSUME I DID IT AFTER

317
00:18:07,937 --> 00:18:08,636
DISCOVERING HOW MUCH I

318
00:18:08,638 --> 00:18:09,937
COMPLAINED ABOUT YOU IN TEXT

319
00:18:09,939 --> 00:18:14,876
MESSAGES TO MY FRIENDS.

320
00:18:14,878 --> 00:18:18,045
>> I SHOULD HAVE SAID HEIGHTS.

321
00:18:18,047 --> 00:18:19,647
>> I'LL SAY.

322
00:18:19,649 --> 00:18:21,115
MOVING ON TO THE GREENS.

323
00:18:21,117 --> 00:18:24,085
ABBY, WHAT IS YOUR HUSBAND'S

324
00:18:24,087 --> 00:18:24,519
GREATEST FEAR?

325
00:18:24,521 --> 00:18:25,720
>> WELL, YOU WON'T SEE THIS MAN

326
00:18:25,722 --> 00:18:26,521
AT A PICNIC.

327
00:18:26,523 --> 00:18:27,088
IT'S BEES.

328
00:18:27,090 --> 00:18:27,789
>> OH, SHOOT.

329
00:18:27,791 --> 00:18:30,391
I SAID LOSING THE KIDS.

330
00:18:30,393 --> 00:18:32,794
>> NO POINTS, BUT THE GREENS ARE

331
00:18:32,796 --> 00:18:34,328
TRYING THEIR BEST.

332
00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:36,597
NEXT QUESTION IS FOR THE LODIS.

333
00:18:36,599 --> 00:18:37,565
WHAT'S SOMETHING YOUR HUSBAND

334
00:18:37,567 --> 00:18:38,900
HAS ALWAYS WANTED TO KNOW?

335
00:18:38,902 --> 00:18:41,235
>> STILL A LITTLE THROWN BY THAT

336
00:18:41,237 --> 00:18:41,869
LAST ONE.

337
00:18:41,871 --> 00:18:43,204
BUT THIS ONE'S EASY.

338
00:18:43,206 --> 00:18:44,772
DO ALIENS EXIST.

339
00:18:44,774 --> 00:18:45,606
>> OKAY.

340
00:18:45,608 --> 00:18:47,608
AND NICK SAID HE'S ALWAYS WANTED

341
00:18:47,610 --> 00:18:49,644
TO KNOW -- IF POLICE CAN STILL

342
00:18:49,646 --> 00:18:51,846
READ YOUR TEXT MESSAGES IF YOU

343
00:18:51,848 --> 00:18:53,281
DESTROY YOUR WIFE'S PHONE RIGHT

344
00:18:53,283 --> 00:18:55,683
AFTER YOUR WIFE IS CRUSHED BY

345
00:18:55,685 --> 00:18:58,286
THE GARAGE DOOR OR EQUIVALENT

346
00:18:58,288 --> 00:18:58,653
ACCIDENT.

347
00:18:58,655 --> 00:19:01,455
>> NICK, WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN

348
00:19:01,457 --> 00:19:01,789
TEXTING?

349
00:19:01,791 --> 00:19:04,158
>> WHOOPS.

350
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,626
OVER TO ABBY.

351
00:19:05,628 --> 00:19:06,694
WHAT'S SOMETHING YOUR HUSBAND

352
00:19:06,696 --> 00:19:07,829
HAS ALWAYS WANTED TO KNOW?

353
00:19:07,831 --> 00:19:09,797
>> WELL, I THINK THIS ONE WILL

354
00:19:09,799 --> 00:19:11,499
GET US BACK ON TRACK, IF THERE'S

355
00:19:11,501 --> 00:19:12,233
AN AFTERLIFE.

356
00:19:12,235 --> 00:19:15,002
>> SOUNDS CONFIDENT.

357
00:19:15,004 --> 00:19:16,838
BRIAN SAID -- WHAT IT FEELS LIKE

358
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:19,807
TO BE WITH A MAN.

359
00:19:19,809 --> 00:19:22,043
>> WHY WOULD YOU SAY THAT ON TV,

360
00:19:22,045 --> 00:19:22,343
BABE?

361
00:19:22,345 --> 00:19:24,879
>> I DIDN'T KNOW WE HAVE TO SHOW

362
00:19:24,881 --> 00:19:27,014
OUR ANSWERS TO EVERYONE.

363
00:19:27,016 --> 00:19:28,416
>> AND THE GREENS CONTINUE TO BE

364
00:19:28,418 --> 00:19:31,719
ODD BUT PLEASANT PEOPLE.

365
00:19:31,721 --> 00:19:33,654
NEXT QUESTION FOR THE LODIS.

366
00:19:33,656 --> 00:19:34,722
WHAT WAS YOUR BIGGEST FIGHT

367
00:19:34,724 --> 00:19:35,022
ABOUT?

368
00:19:35,024 --> 00:19:35,423
>> OKAY.

369
00:19:35,425 --> 00:19:35,957
I KNOW THIS ONE.

370
00:19:35,959 --> 00:19:38,159
THE HAWAII INCIDENT.

371
00:19:38,161 --> 00:19:38,593
>> ALL RIGHT.

372
00:19:38,595 --> 00:19:40,928
NICK SAYS THE HAWAII INCIDENT,

373
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:43,097
AND NICOLE SAYS THE TIME WE WERE

374
00:19:43,099 --> 00:19:44,699
IN HAWAII ON TOP OF A WATERFALL

375
00:19:44,701 --> 00:19:46,467
AND I WANTED TO JUMP IN, BUT YOU

376
00:19:46,469 --> 00:19:49,337
HELD ME BACK AND WOULDN'T LET ME

377
00:19:49,339 --> 00:19:51,138
DO IT UNTIL THERE WERE OTHER

378
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:52,573
PEOPLE AROUND.

379
00:19:52,575 --> 00:19:53,107
FIVE POINTS AWAY.

380
00:19:53,109 --> 00:19:53,841
>> THAT'S WHY YOU WOULDN'T LET

381
00:19:53,843 --> 00:19:56,077
ME JUMP?

382
00:19:56,079 --> 00:19:57,044
>> ALL RIGHT.

383
00:19:57,046 --> 00:19:58,980
THAT SOUND MEANS IT'S TIME FOR A

384
00:19:58,982 --> 00:20:00,181
BONUS QUESTION.

385
00:20:00,183 --> 00:20:01,816
THIS ONE'S FOR NICOLE.

386
00:20:01,818 --> 00:20:03,217
WHERE IS A PLACE YOUR HUSBAND

387
00:20:03,219 --> 00:20:04,919
HAS ALWAYS WANTED TO VISIT?

388
00:20:04,921 --> 00:20:07,421
>> I MEAN, I FEEL LIKE I DON'T

389
00:20:07,423 --> 00:20:08,389
EVEN KNOW THIS MAN.

390
00:20:08,391 --> 00:20:10,691
BUT I GUESS HE ALWAYS SAID

391
00:20:10,693 --> 00:20:11,058
DURANGO.

392
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:11,993
>> YES, BABY, YES.

393
00:20:11,995 --> 00:20:14,028
>> OKAY.

394
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:14,762
FINALLY.

395
00:20:14,764 --> 00:20:18,566
>> AND WHAT'S WITH THE DOT, DOT,

396
00:20:18,568 --> 00:20:18,833
DOT?

397
00:20:18,835 --> 00:20:21,068
WHEN I'M WRONGLY ACCUSED OF YOUR

398
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:22,470
DEATH, I'LL TURN TO THE ONLY

399
00:20:22,472 --> 00:20:24,405
LAWYER I KNOW WHO WOULD POSSIBLY

400
00:20:24,407 --> 00:20:25,907
BELIEVE ME, YOUR COLLEGE

401
00:20:25,909 --> 00:20:27,241
ROOMMATE STEPHANIE.

402
00:20:27,243 --> 00:20:29,410
THE NIGHT BEFORE THE JURY

403
00:20:29,412 --> 00:20:30,678
RETURNS THE VERDICT REALIZING

404
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:32,346
THE SITUATION IS HOPELESS, WE'LL

405
00:20:32,348 --> 00:20:33,781
GO ON THE RUN TOGETHER ACROSS

406
00:20:33,783 --> 00:20:34,715
THE BORDER.

407
00:20:34,717 --> 00:20:36,951
WHEN WE GET TO OUR HOTEL ROOM,

408
00:20:36,953 --> 00:20:39,220
WE SEE THAT THERE'S ONLY ONE

409
00:20:39,222 --> 00:20:39,487
BED.

410
00:20:39,489 --> 00:20:41,455
SHE CALLS THE FRONT DESK TO

411
00:20:41,457 --> 00:20:42,924
COMPLAIN, BUT I SEE SHE'S

412
00:20:42,926 --> 00:20:44,592
HOLDING DOWN THE BUTTON, AND

413
00:20:44,594 --> 00:20:46,127
THAT'S HOW I KNOW IT'S ON.

414
00:20:46,129 --> 00:20:47,328
FINDING OURSELVES IN A PLACE

415
00:20:47,330 --> 00:20:49,096
BEYOND RIGHT AND WRONG, WE MAKE

416
00:20:49,098 --> 00:20:52,733
LOVE AND REACH A NEW APEX OF

417
00:20:52,735 --> 00:20:53,567
HUMAN PLEASURE.

418
00:20:53,569 --> 00:20:55,569
TODAY MIGHT BE MY LAST DAY OF

419
00:20:55,571 --> 00:20:59,140
FREEDOM, AND I ACT ACCORDINGLY.

420
00:20:59,142 --> 00:21:01,108
DRIPPING IN SWEAT, TEN YEARS OF

421
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:03,210
SECRET LONGING, WE STARE AT THE

422
00:21:03,212 --> 00:21:03,544
CEILING.

423
00:21:03,546 --> 00:21:06,414
WHAT'S THE NAME OF THIS TOWN

424
00:21:06,416 --> 00:21:06,914
AGAIN, I WHISPER.

425
00:21:06,916 --> 00:21:08,115
DURANGO, SHE SAYS.

426
00:21:08,117 --> 00:21:10,785
AND THEN SHE MOUNTS ME ONCE

427
00:21:10,787 --> 00:21:11,085
MORE.

428
00:21:11,087 --> 00:21:13,521
SO YOU BOTH SAID DURANGO.

429
00:21:13,523 --> 00:21:15,656
WHICH MEANS LODIS, YOU HAVE WON

430

00:28:33,896 --> 00:28:38,599
AND -- YOUR THING.

650
00:28:38,601 --> 00:28:40,401
>> JUST TELL US ABOUT YOUR

651
00:28:40,403 --> 00:28:40,768
CHILDREN.

652
00:28:40,770 --> 00:28:43,170
>> WELL, I'VE GOT ONE DAUGHTER

653
00:28:43,172 --> 00:28:43,604
AND ONE SON.

654
00:28:43,606 --> 00:28:44,338
>> OH, I'M SO SORRY ABOUT THE

655
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:46,173
BOY.

656
00:28:46,175 --> 00:28:49,810
>> WELL, ACTUALLY, I LOVE MY

657
00:28:49,812 --> 00:28:50,077
SON.

658
00:28:50,079 --> 00:28:51,211
HE'S MY BEST FRIEND.

659
00:28:51,213 --> 00:28:51,779
>> FRIEND?

660
00:28:51,781 --> 00:28:54,047
HOW CAN A SON BE A FRIEND?

661
00:28:54,049 --> 00:28:54,481
NO, NO.

662
00:28:54,483 --> 00:28:57,284
YOUR SON IS A PIECE OF PROPERTY.

663
00:28:57,286 --> 00:29:00,521
ARE YOU FRIENDS WITH THE

664
00:29:00,523 --> 00:29:01,054
MAILBOX?

665
00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:02,689
>> AND WHAT DOES YOUR SON DO FOR

666
00:29:02,691 --> 00:29:03,657
A JOB?

667
00:29:03,659 --> 00:29:05,826
>> WELL, LITTLE FLEX.

668
00:29:05,828 --> 00:29:08,862
HE JUST STARTED DOING A THING

669
00:29:08,864 --> 00:29:09,797
CALLED PAR CORE.

670
00:29:09,799 --> 00:29:12,666
>> OH, HE PARK CARS LIKE A

671
00:29:12,668 --> 00:29:13,167
VALET.

672
00:29:13,169 --> 00:29:13,767
THAT'S GOOD.

673
00:29:13,769 --> 00:29:14,668
THAT'S A GOOD JOB.

674
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:15,803
>> OH, NO.

675
00:29:15,805 --> 00:29:16,870
IT'S PAR CORE.

676
00:29:16,872 --> 00:29:18,972
HE GOES OUT IN THE STREET AND

677
00:29:18,974 --> 00:29:21,041
LIKE TUMBLES OVER STUFF.

678
00:29:21,043 --> 00:29:24,077
>> AND HE GETS PAID FOR THIS?

679
00:29:24,079 --> 00:29:26,079
>> WELL, IN A WAY, NO.

680
00:29:26,081 --> 00:29:27,347
BUT IT'S VERY IMPRESSIVE.

681
00:29:27,349 --> 00:29:28,816
YOU GOT TO SEE IT.

682
00:29:28,818 --> 00:29:31,318
CONNOR, COME OUT AND SHOW THEM

683
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:32,686
YOUR PAR CORE.

684
00:29:32,688 --> 00:29:33,120
UH-OH, UH-OH.

685
00:29:33,122 --> 00:29:37,558
THERE HE GOES.

686
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:37,825
WOW!

687
00:29:37,827 --> 00:29:38,592
GREAT JOB, SON.

688
00:29:38,594 --> 00:29:40,828
>> THANKS, DAD.

689
00:29:40,830 --> 00:29:46,133
>> AHH!

690
00:29:46,135 --> 00:29:50,604
>> OH, MY GOD!

691
00:29:50,606 --> 00:29:53,006
MY FRIEND HAVING SEX WITH HIS

692
00:29:53,008 --> 00:29:53,273
SON!

693
00:29:53,275 --> 00:29:55,309
>> NO, THAT'S NOT SEX.

694
00:29:55,311 --> 00:29:57,544
IT'S JUST HOW WE SHOW AFFECTION.

695
00:29:57,546 --> 00:30:00,948
WE'VE DONE IT SINCE HE WAS A

696
00:30:00,950 --> 00:30:01,248
BABY.

697
00:30:01,250 --> 00:30:02,850
>> HE'S HAD SEX WITH HIM SINCE

698
00:30:02,852 --> 00:30:03,750
HE WAS A BABY.

699
00:30:03,752 --> 00:30:04,585
>> IT'S NOT SEX.

700
00:30:04,587 --> 00:30:07,521
>> LOOKS LIKE SEX.

701
00:30:07,523 --> 00:30:08,021
>> IT'S NOT SEX.

702
00:30:08,023 --> 00:30:09,523
>> IT LOOKY LIKE SEX.

703
00:30:09,525 --> 00:30:11,525
>> IT'S NOT.

704
00:30:11,527 --> 00:30:13,093
IT DON'T LOOKY LIKE SEX.

705
00:30:13,095 --> 00:30:15,529
CONNOR, LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.

706
00:30:15,531 --> 00:30:17,097
THESE GUYS DON'T GET IT.

707
00:30:17,099 --> 00:30:17,431
COME ON.

708
00:30:17,433 --> 00:30:21,435
GIDDY UP.

709
00:30:21,437 --> 00:30:23,103
>> WELL, THAT IS ALL THE TIME

710
00:30:23,105 --> 00:30:25,138
THAT WE ARE HAVING FOR IMMIGRANT

711
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:25,506
DAD TALK.

712
00:30:25,508 --> 00:30:27,841
>> AND UNTIL THE NEXT TIME,

713
00:30:27,843 --> 00:30:28,642
ALWAYS REMEMBER --

714
00:30:28,644 --> 00:30:34,348
>> HIT 'EM WITH THE BELT!

715
00:31:02,777 --> 00:31:10,717
30 POINTS.

716
00:31:10,719 --> 00:31:11,151
>> ALL RIGHT.

717
00:31:11,153 --> 00:31:13,487
Y'ALL SEE THE SCORE?

718
00:31:13,489 --> 00:31:15,022
WE'RE PLAYING LIKE SOME PUNKS

719
00:31:15,024 --> 00:31:15,856
OUT THERE.

720
00:31:15,858 --> 00:31:19,126
AS YOUR COACH, I'VE GIVEN YOU

721
00:31:19,128 --> 00:31:20,260
SPEECH AFTER SPEECH, BUT CLEARLY

722
00:31:20,262 --> 00:31:21,361
SOMETHING ISN'T GETTING THROUGH.

723
00:31:21,363 --> 00:31:23,530
SO MAYBE YOU NEED TO HEAR FROM

724
00:31:23,532 --> 00:31:24,731
ONE OF YOUR OWN.

725
00:31:24,733 --> 00:31:25,098
CAPTAIN.

726
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:27,968
>> YEAH, COACH.

727
00:31:27,970 --> 00:31:29,503
GUYS, WE SHOULD BE UP BY 20

728
00:31:29,505 --> 00:31:31,171
POINTS RIGHT NOW, BUT WE'RE

729
00:31:31,173 --> 00:31:34,441
GETTING OUR ASSES KICKED BECAUSE

730
00:31:34,443 --> 00:31:41,548
WE'RE NOT FOCUSED ON THE

731
00:31:41,550 --> 00:31:41,982
FUNDAMENTALS.

732
00:31:41,984 --> 00:31:42,582
>> FUNDAMENTALS.

733
00:31:42,584 --> 00:31:45,018
>> WE LOST TO CANYON HIGH LAST

734
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:45,319
WEEK.

735
00:31:45,321 --> 00:31:46,987
MILLER'S OUT WITH AN ANKLE

736
00:31:46,989 --> 00:31:48,889
SPRAIN, AND ON TUESDAY, COACH

737
00:31:48,891 --> 00:31:50,090
ACCIDENTALLY SENT THAT WEIRD

738
00:31:50,092 --> 00:31:51,825
PICTURE OF HIMSELF TO THE TEAM

739
00:31:51,827 --> 00:31:53,794
GROUP CHAT INSTEAD OF HIS WIFE.

740
00:31:53,796 --> 00:31:55,629
BUT WE GOT TO MOVE PAST THAT.

741
00:31:55,631 --> 00:31:58,832
>> IT'S IN THE PAST, GENTLEMEN.

742
00:31:58,834 --> 00:32:00,567
>> I MEAN, LOOK, DID I WANT TO

743
00:32:00,569 --> 00:32:02,869
SEE COACH WEARING ONLY A FUR

744
00:32:02,871 --> 00:32:05,205
THONG AND CAT EARS ON ALL FOURS

745
00:32:05,207 --> 00:32:08,108
LICKING MILK OUT OF A BOWL?

746
00:32:08,110 --> 00:32:08,709
NO.

747
00:32:08,711 --> 00:32:11,345
BUT THAT'S NO EXCUSE TO NOT PLAY

748
00:32:11,347 --> 00:32:12,312
MY ASS OFF TONIGHT.

749
00:32:12,314 --> 00:32:13,613
>> NO EXCUSE!

750
00:32:13,615 --> 00:32:17,417
>> AND, YEAH, DID IT SUCK THAT

751
00:32:17,419 --> 00:32:21,288
COACH DIDN'T REALIZE WHAT HE HAD

752
00:32:21,290 --> 00:32:23,290
DONE AND SENT EVEN MORE PICTURES

753
00:32:23,292 --> 00:32:24,291
TO THE GROUP?

754
00:32:24,293 --> 00:32:25,425
YES, IT SUCKED.

755
00:32:25,427 --> 00:32:28,161
BUT WE CAN'T BE THINKING ABOUT

756
00:32:28,163 --> 00:32:28,628
THAT RIGHT NOW.

757
00:32:28,630 --> 00:32:29,763
>> IT'S JUST SOMETHING MY WIFE

758
00:32:29,765 --> 00:32:30,797
AND I DO, GENTLEMEN.

759
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:35,669
WE GOT TO MOVE ON FROM THAT.

760
00:32:35,671 --> 00:32:37,137
STOP THINKING ABOUT MY PICS.

761
00:32:37,139 --> 00:32:37,904
>> I'M NOT THINKING ABOUT YOUR

762
00:32:37,906 --> 00:32:38,605
PICS, COACH.

763
00:32:38,607 --> 00:32:42,009
I'M THINKING ABOUT THE VIDEO OF

764
00:32:42,011 --> 00:32:44,978
YOU GOING TO THE BATHROOM IN THE

765
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:45,412
LITTER BOX.

766
00:32:45,414 --> 00:32:45,812
>> ME TOO.

767
00:32:45,814 --> 00:32:47,514
>> IT DOESN'T MATTER WHY COACH'S

768
00:32:47,516 --> 00:32:50,450
WIFE GETS TURNED ON BY THAT, ALL

769
00:32:50,452 --> 00:32:50,817
RIGHT?

770
00:32:50,819 --> 00:32:52,586
SHE LIKES SEEING HIM GO TO THE

771
00:32:52,588 --> 00:32:54,121
BATHROOM IN A LITTER BOX.

772
00:32:54,123 --> 00:32:54,521
THAT'S IT.

773
00:32:54,523 --> 00:32:56,923
>> 26 YEARS OF MARRIAGE, FELLAS.

774
00:32:56,925 --> 00:32:59,092
YOU NEED TO MIX IT UP SOMETIMES.

775
00:32:59,094 --> 00:33:00,293
>> CAN I SAY SOMETHING?

776
00:33:00,295 --> 00:33:02,529
I'M SORRY I POSTED COACH'S VIDEO

777
00:33:02,531 --> 00:33:03,263
ON TIKTOK.

778
00:33:03,265 --> 00:33:04,064
I THOUGHT IT WAS AI.

779
00:33:04,066 --> 00:33:06,199
>> WE KNOW THAT, RODRIGUES.

780
00:33:06,201 --> 00:33:08,168
THE POINT IS NONE OF US HAVE AN

781
00:33:08,170 --> 00:33:10,003
EXCUSE TO BE PLAYING THIS BAD

782
00:33:10,005 --> 00:33:10,737
EXCEPT FOR CHRIS BECAUSE COACH

783
00:33:10,739 --> 00:33:17,711
IS HIS DAD.

784
00:33:17,713 --> 00:33:20,547
>> DON'T YOU WORRY ABOUT MY BOY.

785
00:33:20,549 --> 00:33:21,281
HE'S GOING TO TURN IT ON IN THE

786
00:33:21,283 --> 00:33:24,918
SECOND HALF.

787
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,653
>> SIR, I WANT TO FOCUS.

788
00:33:26,655 --> 00:33:29,523
BUT IT'S KIND OF HARD WHEN THE

789
00:33:29,525 --> 00:33:30,791
OTHER TEAM'S FANS KEEP LIKE

790
00:33:30,793 --> 00:33:32,092
SHINING LASER POINTERS ON THE

791
00:33:32,094 --> 00:33:34,127
FLOOR TRYING TO GET COACH TO

792
00:33:34,129 --> 00:33:34,561
CHASE THEM.

793
00:33:34,563 --> 00:33:38,398
>> WHICH I WON'T.

794
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:40,834
>> SORRY, A PACKAGE HERE FOR

795
00:33:40,836 --> 00:33:41,301
COACH WILLIAMS.

796
00:33:41,303 --> 00:33:42,669
>> MAN, THIS BETTER NOT BE

797
00:33:42,671 --> 00:33:47,007
ANOTHER ONE OF THEM -- IT IS.

798
00:33:47,009 --> 00:33:49,943
KITTY LITTER.

799
00:33:49,945 --> 00:33:51,378
Y'ALL SEE THIS?

800
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:53,780
THIS IS THE OTHER TEAM TRYING TO

801
00:33:53,782 --> 00:33:56,516
GET INTO OUR HEADS, AND IT

802
00:33:56,518 --> 00:33:57,751
WASN'T FUNNY THE FIRST TEN

803
00:33:57,753 --> 00:33:58,051
TIMES.

804
00:33:58,053 --> 00:34:03,590
IT'S NOT FUNNY NOW.

805
00:34:03,592 --> 00:34:04,458
>> LOOK, WE CAN STILL WIN THIS,

806
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:04,858
ALL RIGHT?

807
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:07,861
BUT WE GOT TO PLAY BETTER

808
00:34:07,863 --> 00:34:08,261
DEFENSE.

809
00:34:08,263 --> 00:34:10,063
SO WHOEVER YOU'RE COVERING, BE

810
00:34:10,065 --> 00:34:10,697
ON THEM.

811
00:34:10,699 --> 00:34:13,100
WHEREVER THEY GO, JUST FOLLOW

812
00:34:13,102 --> 00:34:13,600
THEM.

813
00:34:13,602 --> 00:34:15,635
JUST LIKE HOW WHEREVER THE COACH

814
00:34:15,637 --> 00:34:18,772
GOES, THE STATE APPOINTED SOCIAL

815
00:34:18,774 --> 00:34:19,206
WORKER GOES.

816
00:34:19,208 --> 00:34:20,240
>> DON'T MIND ME.

817
00:34:20,242 --> 00:34:21,975
JUST MAKING SURE EVERYBODY FEELS

818
00:34:21,977 --> 00:34:22,275
SAFE.

>> NO, NOT FROM THE CAT VIDEOS.

824
00:34:32,521 --> 00:34:35,288
FROM WHAT HE SAYS IN PRACTICE.

825

PARENTS ASKED HIM NOT TO.

833
00:34:48,270 --> 00:34:51,304

YOU KNOW, GENTLEMEN, I'M GOING

835
00:34:53,041 --> 00:34:55,108
TO BE REAL WITH YOU.

836
00:34:55,110 --> 00:34:58,245
WHEN I REALIZED WHAT I HAD DONE,

837
00:34:58,247 --> 00:34:59,813
I CONSIDERED GETTING INTO MY CAR

838
00:34:59,815 --> 00:35:02,415
AND DRIVING OFF TO START A NEW

839
00:35:02,417 --> 00:35:04,050
LIFE SOMEWHERE ELSE, BUT I

840
00:35:04,052 --> 00:35:04,651
COULDN'T LEAVE MY TEAM.

841
00:35:04,653 --> 00:35:06,586
COULDN'T LEAVE MY SON.

842
00:35:06,588 --> 00:35:07,921
AND I KNOW THAT ONE DAY, HE'S

843
00:35:07,923 --> 00:35:10,790
GOING TO EVENTUALLY TALK AGAIN.

844
00:35:10,792 --> 00:35:13,026
AND WHEN HE DOES, THE FIRST

845
00:35:13,028 --> 00:35:14,694
WORDS OUT OF HIS MOUTH ARE NOT

846
00:35:14,696 --> 00:35:16,663
GOING TO BE, DAD, I WANT TO GO

847
00:35:16,665 --> 00:35:18,598

856
00:35:36,618 --> 00:35:39,219
YOU KNOW, FASTING FOR RAMADAN

857
00:35:39,221 --> 00:35:40,487
USED TO BE EASY, BUT THE LAST

858
00:35:40,489 --> 00:35:41,855
FEW YEARS WITH WORK AND A

859
00:35:41,857 --> 00:35:44,591
GROWING FAMILY, IT'S FELT ALMOST

860

IMPOSSIBLE.

861
00:35:46,361 --> 00:35:46,826
BUT NOT ANYMORE.

862
00:35:46,828 --> 00:35:51,631
THANKS TO OZEMPIC FOR RAMADAN.

863
00:35:51,633 --> 00:35:54,100
>> OZEMPIC IS A MEDICATION

864
00:35:54,102 --> 00:35:56,536
PRESCRIBED TO SUPPRESS HUNGER

865
00:35:56,538 --> 00:35:58,572
AND SLOW DIGESTION, AND RAMADAN

866
00:35:58,574 --> 00:36:00,941
IS A MONTH WHERE MUSLIMS SUSTAIN

867
00:36:00,943 --> 00:36:02,776
FROM FOOD AND WATER FROM SUNRISE

868
00:36:02,778 --> 00:36:03,343
TO SUNSET.

869
00:36:03,345 --> 00:36:05,712
>> I USED TO RUSH TO EAT A WHOLE

870
00:36:05,714 --> 00:36:06,813
MEAL BEFORE DAWN.

871
00:36:06,815 --> 00:36:09,549

AND OZEMPIC NEEDLES.

873
00:36:11,386 --> 00:36:13,520
AS LONG AS I SHOOT UP BEFORE THE

874
00:36:13,522 --> 00:36:15,956
SUN RISES, IT'S ALL GOOD.

875
00:36:15,958 --> 00:36:18,091
>> SINCE MY GR DOCTOR PRESCRIBED

876
00:36:18,093 --> 00:36:20,293
OZEMPIC FOR RAMADAN, I'VE NEVER

877

GOTTEN MORE WORK DONE.

878

WANT TO CONVERT.

895

00:51:28,786 --> 00:51:32,087
>> THAT'S WHAT EVERY WIDOW WANTS

1318
00:51:32,089 --> 00:51:33,389
TO HEAR, YOUR DEAD HUSBAND HAD

1319
00:51:33,391 --> 00:51:34,190
SEVERE HERPES.

1320
00:51:34,192 --> 00:51:36,826
BY THE WAY, WHY WAS THERE EVEN

1321
00:51:36,828 --> 00:51:37,960
AN AUTOPSY?

1322
00:51:37,962 --> 00:51:40,229
WHEN A BIRD BASICALLY EXPLODES

1323
00:51:40,231 --> 00:51:41,497
INTO THE SIDE OF A BUILDING,

1324
00:51:41,499 --> 00:51:44,867
WHO'S LIKE, HOW DID HE DIE?

1325
00:51:44,869 --> 00:51:47,703
>> WELL, SOME PEOPLE THINK THAT

1326
00:51:47,705 --> 00:51:50,506
AUTOPSIES CAN HELP BRING A SENSE

1327
00:51:50,508 --> 00:51:50,906
OF CLOSURE.

1328
00:51:50,908 --> 00:51:53,342
>> YEAH, BUT THE PHRASE PIGEON

1329
00:51:53,344 --> 00:51:55,978
HERPES KIND OF RAISES MORE

1330
00:51:55,980 --> 00:51:57,713
QUESTIONS THAN ANSWERS, COLIN.

1331
00:51:57,715 --> 00:51:59,081
QUESTIONS LIKE IS THAT WHAT MY

1332
00:51:59,083 --> 00:52:03,052
BUMPS ARE?

1333
00:52:03,054 --> 00:52:06,121
AND HOW DID HE GET PIGEON HERPES

1334
00:52:06,123 --> 00:52:08,858
WHEN THE ONLY PIGEON WE KNEW WAS

1335
00:52:08,860 --> 00:52:11,627
OUR SEXY NANNY, AND WHY IS THE

1336
00:52:11,629 --> 00:52:13,295
MEDIA ALWAYS TEARING GREAT MEN

1337
00:52:13,297 --> 00:52:13,629
DOWN.

1338
00:52:13,631 --> 00:52:14,830
YOU KNOW?

1339
00:52:14,832 --> 00:52:17,900
IT'S ALWAYS FDR HAD A MISTRESS,

1340
00:52:17,902 --> 00:52:20,936
OR MLK HAD A MISTRESS, OR COLIN

1341
00:52:20,938 --> 00:52:24,807
JOST HAD AN UNDERAGED MISTRESS

1342
00:52:24,809 --> 00:52:27,710
OR FLACO WENT BLIND FROM SEVERE

1343
00:52:27,712 --> 00:52:28,043
HERPES.

1344
00:52:28,045 --> 00:52:28,377
>> WAIT.

1345
00:52:28,379 --> 00:52:28,677
WHAT?

1346
00:52:28,679 --> 00:52:31,213
>> WHO?

1347
00:52:31,215 --> 00:52:32,915
>> WHO?

1348
00:52:32,917 --> 00:52:36,886
>> WHO, WHO, WHO?

1349
00:52:36,888 --> 00:52:39,722
LOOK, COLIN, I'M NO DUMMY.

1350
00:52:39,724 --> 00:52:40,689
FLACO BANGED ANYTHING WITH A

1351
00:52:40,691 --> 00:52:42,224
PAIR OF WINGS.

1352
00:52:42,226 --> 00:52:46,996
I MEAN, EAGLES, PARROTS, FLYING

1353
00:52:46,998 --> 00:52:47,363
SQUIRRELS.

1354
00:52:47,365 --> 00:52:49,198
I ONCE CAUGHT HIM DIPPING TIP IN

1355
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:52,835
A FROZEN TURKEY.

1356
00:52:52,837 --> 00:52:55,037
AND I BET HE'S UP IN HEAVEN

1357
00:52:55,039 --> 00:52:56,538
RIGHT NOW PUTTING IT DOWN IN ONE

1358
00:52:56,540 --> 00:53:00,009
OF THOSE ANGELS.

1359
00:53:00,011 --> 00:53:02,778
BUT YOU KNOW HOW IT IS, COLIN.

1360
00:53:02,780 --> 00:53:04,813
YOU KNOW HOW IT IS WHEN YOU'RE

1361
00:53:04,815 --> 00:53:06,749
MARRIED TO A BIG-TIME CELEBRITY.

1362
00:53:06,751 --> 00:53:08,417
THEY GET TO HAVE SEX WITH

1363
00:53:08,419 --> 00:53:09,752
WHOEVER THEY WANT, AND THERE'S

1364
00:53:09,754 --> 00:53:10,753
NOTHING WE CAN DO ABOUT IT,

1365
00:53:10,755 --> 00:53:15,624
RIGHT, BROTHER?

1366
00:53:15,626 --> 00:53:22,998
>> THEMS THE RULES.

1367
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,968
>> WHY DID IT HAVE TO BE

1368
00:53:25,970 --> 00:53:26,302
PIGEONS?

1369
00:53:26,304 --> 00:53:27,303
IT'S HUMILIATING.

1370
00:53:27,305 --> 00:53:30,940
THEY'RE A BUNCH OF CRUMB-PECKING

1371
00:53:30,942 --> 00:53:31,273
SKANKS.

1372
00:53:31,275 --> 00:53:31,640
I GET IT.

1373
00:53:31,642 --> 00:53:35,177
THEIR NECK GAME IS INSANE.

1374
00:53:35,179 --> 00:53:36,478
>> OKAY.

1375
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:38,280
>> HOO, HOO, HOO.

1376
00:53:38,282 --> 00:53:40,149

1377
00:53:40,151 --> 00:53:40,449
SORRY.

1378
00:53:40,451 --> 00:53:43,218
I KNOW THIS MUST BE TOUGH FOR

1379
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:43,519
YOU.

1380
00:53:43,521 --> 00:53:46,088
>> EW, COLIN, ARE YOU COMING ON

1381
00:53:46,090 --> 00:53:46,956
TO ME?

1382
00:53:46,958 --> 00:53:49,558
>> NO, I'M NOT.

1383
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:51,593
>> YOU KNOW MY HUSBAND JUST

1384
00:53:51,595 --> 00:53:52,294
DIED, RIGHT?

1385
00:53:52,296 --> 00:53:53,162
>> OKAY.

1386
00:53:53,164 --> 00:53:53,562
I'M SORRY.

1387
00:53:53,564 --> 00:53:54,897
>> ALTHOUGH, YOU ARE MY TYPE.

1388
00:53:54,899 --> 00:53:57,399
>> WHAT TYPE IS THAT?

1389
00:53:57,401 --> 00:53:59,234
>> A NOCTURNAL PREDATOR.

1390
00:53:59,236 --> 00:54:01,670
>> FLACO'S WIDOW, EVERYONE.

1391
00:54:01,672 --> 00:54:02,705
FOR "WEEKEND UPDATE," I

1392
00:54:28,431 --> 00:54:33,102
>> LOOKS LIKE A MUGGING,

1393
00:54:33,104 --> 00:54:33,469
DETECTIVE.

1394
00:54:33,471 --> 00:54:36,438
HE WAS PICKING UP A PIZZA WHEN

1395
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:39,908
HE WAS STRUCK FROM BEHIND.

1396
00:54:39,910 --> 00:54:40,709
>> WHAT CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT

1397
00:54:40,711 --> 00:54:41,944
THE VIC?

1398
00:54:41,946 --> 00:54:44,146
>> NO ID YET.

1399
00:54:44,148 --> 00:54:44,713
HE'S MALE.

1400
00:54:44,715 --> 00:54:47,082
WE'RE THINKING MID 40s.

1401
00:54:47,084 --> 00:54:52,421
>> SHOULD GET ID RESULTS SOON.

1402
00:54:52,423 --> 00:54:54,323
>> POOR BASTARD WAS JUST PICKING

1403
00:54:54,325 --> 00:54:54,723
UP A PIZZA.

1404
00:54:54,725 --> 00:55:00,963
WHAT DO YOU THINK, SIMS?

1405
00:55:00,965 --> 00:55:01,630
>> I THINK -- HE SHOULD'VE

1406
00:55:01,632 --> 00:55:07,403
ORDERED DELIVERY.

1407
00:55:07,405 --> 00:55:10,005
>> YEAH.

1408
00:55:10,007 --> 00:55:11,540
SO, BASED ON THE STATE OF THE

1409
00:55:11,542 --> 00:55:13,308
BODY, I WOULD PUT TIME OF DEATH

1410
00:55:13,310 --> 00:55:14,777
MAYBE YESTERDAY, 5:00 P.M.

1411
00:55:14,779 --> 00:55:16,512
>> SO HE'S BEEN SITTING OUT HERE

1412
00:55:16,514 --> 00:55:16,945
ALL NIGHT.

1413
00:55:16,947 --> 00:55:17,446
>> YEAH.

1414
00:55:17,448 --> 00:55:19,248
NO SIGNS OF A STRUGGLE.

1415
00:55:19,250 --> 00:55:19,948
POOR GUY DIDN'T EVEN SEE HIM

1416
00:55:19,950 --> 00:55:22,451
COMING.

1417
00:55:22,453 --> 00:55:24,787
>> HOW YOU GUYS DOING?

1418
00:55:24,789 --> 00:55:25,721
>> NOT GREAT.

1419
00:55:25,723 --> 00:55:26,755
THE GUY'S DEAD.

1420
00:55:26,757 --> 00:55:27,189
>> YEAH.

1421
00:55:27,191 --> 00:55:27,523
TOTALLY.

1422
00:55:27,525 --> 00:55:30,025
POOR GUY.

1423
00:55:30,027 --> 00:55:33,429
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU, BUT I'M

1424

>> YEAH, MAN.

1427
00:55:40,871 --> 00:55:43,405
WE HEARD YOU THE FIRST TIME.

1428
00:55:43,407 --> 00:55:44,540

00:55:45,309 --> 00:55:46,208
YOU WERE RIGHT NEXT TO US.

1431
00:55:46,210 --> 00:55:47,209

FIRST TIME.

1435
00:55:52,783 --> 00:55:55,050

>> YEAH.

1438

BODY.

1440
00:55:58,355 --> 00:56:02,291
WE THINK THIS MIGHT BE IT.

1441
00:56:02,293 --> 00:56:04,660
>> PRETTY ROUGH SCENE, HUH?

1442
00:56:04,662 --> 00:56:05,461
>> YEAH.

1443

00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:44,399
BECAUSE BASED ON THE CRIME

1469
00:56:44,401 --> 00:56:45,767
SCENE, IT'S CLEAR THAT SOMEBODY

1470

00:57:09,827 --> 00:57:10,159
>> NO.

1482

NO.

1483
