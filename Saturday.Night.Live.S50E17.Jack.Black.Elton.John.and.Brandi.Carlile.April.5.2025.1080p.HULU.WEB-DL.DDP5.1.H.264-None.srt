1
00:00:00,656 --> 00:00:04,004
>>> ON WEDNESDAY, PRESIDENT
TRUMP GIVES A SPEECH IN THE ROSE
GARDEN

2
00:00:04,004 --> 00:00:06,337
ABOUT HIS ECONOMIC VISION FOR AMERICA,

3
00:00:06,337 --> 00:00:10,165
INCLUDING TARIFFS
AGAINST ALMOST EVERY COUNTRY WE
DO BUSINESS WITH.

4
00:00:10,165 --> 00:00:13,246
AND LIKE EVERYTHING SO FAR IN HIS PRESIDENCY,

5
00:00:13,246 --> 00:00:15,381
IT WAS A TOTAL
HOME RUN.

6
00:00:15,381 --> 00:00:17,447
WE GO NOW TO AN ENCORE
PRESENTATION

7
00:00:17,447 --> 00:00:20,711
OF TRUMP'S
HISTORICALLY AWESOME
SPEECH.

8
00:00:21,311 --> 00:00:23,545
THANK

9
00:00:23,545 --> 00:00:27,085
THANK YOU ALL FOR COMING OUT
TO HEAR ABOUT TARIFFS.

10
00:00:27,085 --> 00:00:29,017
MY FAVORITE WORD, TARIFF.

11
00:00:29,017 --> 00:00:32,812
WHICH OF COURSE IS SHORT FOR
TARIFFIC IDEA.

12
00:00:32,812 --> 00:00:36,625
THEY'RE THE BACKBONE OF MY
INCREDIBLE PLAN FOR OUR ECONOMY.

13
00:00:36,625 --> 00:00:40,782
IT'S ACTUALLY BETTER THAN A PLAN
BECAUSE IT'S A SERIES OF RANDOM
NUMBERS.

14
00:00:40,782 --> 00:00:45,280
LIKE THE
NUMBERS ON COMPUTER SCREENS IN
SEVERANCE.

15
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:49,915
YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THE HELL
THEY MEAN, BUT
I KNOW WHAT THE NUMBERS MEAN.
OKAY?

16
00:00:49,915 --> 00:00:53,370
THEY MEAN
WE'RE GOING TO MAKE AMERICA
WEALTHY AGAIN, OKAY?

17
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:55,392
MAWA,

18
00:00:55,392 --> 00:00:57,256
MAWA. BROING

19
00:00:57,256 --> 00:01:00,340
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE GOING TO CHECK
YOUR STOCK PORTFOLIO IN
A COUPLE OF DAYS

20
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:04,717
AND THINK I'M
ALMOST TOO WEALTHY, MAWA.

21
00:01:04,717 --> 00:01:08,477
BEFORE THAT, WE'RE GOING TO DO
MAGDA.

22
00:01:08,477 --> 00:01:13,520
MAGDA,
MAKE AMERICA GREAT DEPRESSION
AGAIN.

23
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,931
IT WILL BE BETTER THAN GREAT,

24
00:01:15,931 --> 00:01:18,899
A FANTASTIC, UNBELIEVABLE
DEPRESSION.

25
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:21,954
THE LIKES OF WHICH WE'VE NEVER
SEEN BEFORE.

26
00:01:21,954 --> 00:01:25,209
WE LOVE TO SAY THE LIKES OF
WHICH WE NEVER HAVE SEEN BEFORE.

27
00:01:25,209 --> 00:01:27,384
YOU KNOW, THIS DEPRESSION IS
GOING TO BE SO GREAT.

28
00:01:27,384 --> 00:01:31,139
WE'LL BE THE ONES EATING CATS
AND DOGS.
AND THAT'S FUN, FOLKS.

29
00:01:31,139 --> 00:01:34,581
LOW AND SLOW, BRAISE THEM, YOU
KNOW.

30
00:01:34,581 --> 00:01:37,948
THE STOCK MARKET HAS CRASHED
TEMPORARILY,

31
00:01:37,948 --> 00:01:40,843
BUT THAT'S ALL PART OF THE PLAN,

32
00:01:40,843 --> 00:01:42,783
IT'S SIMPLE
ECONOMICS.

33
00:01:42,783 --> 00:01:47,030
IF THE STOCK MARKET GOES DOWN
AND DOWN AND DOWN,

34
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:51,232
IT MEANS IT
HAS NOWHERE TO GO BUT UP.
OR PERHAPS FURTHER DOWN.

35
00:01:51,232 --> 00:01:54,303
WE GOT TO DO THESE TARIFFS,
FOLKS, WE HAVE TO.

36
00:01:54,303 --> 00:01:56,571
NO IDEA WHY BUT WE'VE GOT TO DO
THEM.

37
00:01:56,571 --> 00:02:00,319
NOW IT'S TIME FOR THE REALLY BIG
PIECE OF CARDBOARD.

38
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:02,393
HOWARD, YOU WANT TO BRING IT UP?

39
00:02:02,393 --> 00:02:04,862
THIS IS WONDERFUL, MY COMMERCE SECRETARY

40
00:02:04,862 --> 00:02:07,124
HOWARD LUTNICK
EVERYBODY, THANK YOU.

41
00:02:07,124 --> 00:02:10,928
NOW WE'VE GOT THE BIG CARDBOARD,
THIS IS GREAT.

42
00:02:14,058 --> 00:02:17,636
YOU KNOW WHAT, THIS IS A
CHEESECAKE FACTORY MENU.
THAT'S FOR THE LUNCH AFTER.

43
00:02:17,636 --> 00:02:19,156
I'M GETTING BANG BANG TACOS.

44
00:02:19,156 --> 00:02:20,897
GIVE

45
00:02:20,897 --> 00:02:25,112
THANKS HOWARD, YOU'RE DOING A
GREAT JOB TO FIGURE OUT THE
SCARY TARIFFS.

46
00:02:25,112 --> 00:02:28,756
WOULD YOU LIKE TO BE FACE OF THE
TARIFFS WITH ME?

47
00:02:28,756 --> 00:02:30,867
>> NO, I'M GOOD.

48
00:02:30,867 --> 00:02:33,386
>> HE'S A MODEST GUY.

49
00:02:33,386 --> 00:02:35,977
HERE IT IS.
LOOK AT THIS, THAT'S SO
BEAUTIFUL.

50
00:02:35,977 --> 00:02:37,609
WE SPENT SO MUCH TIME,

51
00:02:37,609 --> 00:02:40,972
FRANKLY MILLIONS
OF DOLLARS, FRANKLY, ON THIS
PIECE OF CARDBOARD.

52
00:02:40,972 --> 00:02:45,254
WE LISTED THE COUNTRIES IN AN
ORDER THAT'S NEITHER
ALPHABETICAL NOR NUMERICAL

53
00:02:45,254 --> 00:02:48,426
FOR
MAXIMUM CONFUSION.

54
00:02:48,426 --> 00:02:51,203
AND THE TARIFFS WILL BE
RECIPROCAL.

55
00:02:51,203 --> 00:02:53,262
WE LOVE THE WORD RECIPROCAL,

56
00:02:53,262 --> 00:02:57,174
EXCEPT IN THE BEDROOM, RIGHT
FELLOWS?
YOU WANT ME TO DO WHAT?

57
00:02:57,174 --> 00:03:00,802
GUYS KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING
ABOUT.

58
00:03:00,802 --> 00:03:03,822
SOME PEOPLE SAY MY PLAN IS NONSENSE

59
00:03:03,822 --> 00:03:07,699
BUT WE'RE USING A
FORMULA, THEY CALL IT FORMULA,

60
00:03:07,699 --> 00:03:10,982
IT'S COMPLICATED BUT LET ME
EXPLAIN HOW IT WORKS.

61
00:03:10,982 --> 00:03:12,298
GIVE ME THAT.

62
00:03:13,148 --> 00:03:16,345
ALL RIGHT.
SO THAT'S A TRIANGLE.

63
00:03:16,345 --> 00:03:18,375
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT IS.

64
00:03:18,375 --> 00:03:21,409
UP HERE, XI, FROM CHINA.

65
00:03:21,409 --> 00:03:24,805
AND THAT'S MI STABBING HIM WITH
A SWORD.

66
00:03:24,805 --> 00:03:27,852
AND THEN DOWN HERE THERE'S SOME
SIDEWAYS BOOBS.

67
00:03:27,852 --> 00:03:29,025
YOU GET IT.

68
00:03:29,025 --> 00:03:32,365
YOUR MONEY IS GONE, THAT'S THE
OKAY, WE'RE GOING TO FIGURE IT
OUT.

69
00:03:32,365 --> 00:03:35,017
NO COUNTRY IS SAFE FROM MY
TARIFFS.

70
00:03:35,017 --> 00:03:38,656
I EVEN PUT TARIFFS ON AN ISLAND
UNINHABITED BY HUMANS.

71
00:03:38,656 --> 00:03:41,213
IT'S CALLED HEARD & McDONALD
ISLAND.

72
00:03:41,213 --> 00:03:45,365
McDONALD ISLAND,
I WOULD LOVE TO VISIT THERE.
RIGHT?

73
00:03:45,365 --> 00:03:49,500
CAN YOU IMAGINE THAT?
BIG MAC AND A HULA SKIRT.
OOH LA LA.

74
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:52,716
I HAD THEM MOCK UP McDONALD
ISLAND.

75
00:03:52,716 --> 00:03:54,782
WOULD YOU BRING IT UP?

76
00:03:54,782 --> 00:03:56,431
THERE YOU GO.

77
00:03:56,431 --> 00:03:59,287
WANT

78
00:03:59,287 --> 00:04:02,880
GET ME TO GOD'S COUNTRY, RIGHT?

79
00:04:04,508 --> 00:04:06,665
REMEMBER THAT?

80
00:04:06,822 --> 00:04:09,938
THE POINT IS EVERYTHING
IS GOING TO BE FINE,

81
00:04:09,938 --> 00:04:11,568
AND/OR BAD.

82
00:04:11,568 --> 00:04:13,817
EVERYBODY IS WORRIED ABOUT
PRICES GOING UP,

83
00:04:13,817 --> 00:04:17,971
ESPECIALLY THE
PRICE OF GROKERIES.
AM I SAYING THAT RIGHT?

84
00:04:17,971 --> 00:04:20,949
FOOD FROM THE GROKERIE STORE.

85
00:04:20,949 --> 00:04:22,999
OLD FASHIONED TERM.

86
00:04:22,999 --> 00:04:26,919
WE NEED TO SEND A MESSAGE TO
COUNTRIES RIPPING US OFF,

87
00:04:26,919 --> 00:04:32,083
SOUTH
AFRICA PUTS A 60% TARIFF ON
EVERYTHING WE SEND THEM

88
00:04:32,083 --> 00:04:35,630
AND
THEY'VE NEVER SENT US ONE GOOD
THING.

89
00:04:35,987 --> 00:04:38,508
>> WHAT ABOUT ME?

90
00:04:40,183 --> 00:04:42,501
>> SAY CHEESE!

91
00:04:42,501 --> 00:04:44,846
KIDDING.

92
00:04:44,846 --> 00:04:46,975
COME ON, COMEDY!

93
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:53,643
THAT IS FROM WHEN I TRIED TO BUY
THE ELECTION IN WISCONSIN.

94
00:04:53,784 --> 00:04:57,447
I'M AN IDIOT, I SHOULD HAVE JUST
BOUGHT WISCONSIN.

95
00:04:57,745 --> 00:04:59,547
GLITCH.

96
00:05:02,602 --> 00:05:06,581
PIN-WHEEL, PIN-WHEEL, PIN-WHEEL.

97
00:05:06,581 --> 00:05:08,626
AND I'M BACK.

98
00:05:08,626 --> 00:05:11,362
>> ELON IS GREAT BUT SADLY,

99
00:05:11,362 --> 00:05:13,778
IT'S TIME TO NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN,
OKAY?

100
00:05:13,778 --> 00:05:17,599
YOU'VE GOT TO GET BACK TO TESS
TESLA BECAUSE THEY'RE DOING
PRETTY BAD.

101
00:05:17,599 --> 00:05:20,733
>> YES, AND RECENTLY OUR
DEALERSHIPS HAVE

102
00:05:20,733 --> 00:05:23,446
BEEN THE
TARGETS OF MANY ATTACKS.

103
00:05:23,446 --> 00:05:26,895
SUDDENLY NO ONE LIKES TESLA
CARS.

104
00:05:26,895 --> 00:05:29,235
I ASKED MYSELF WHY,

105
00:05:29,235 --> 00:05:32,318
THEN I ANSWERED MYSELF, BECAUSE OF ME.

106
00:05:32,318 --> 00:05:38,373
WHICH IS WHY WE ARE INTRODUCING
THE NEW TESLA MODEL-V.

107
00:05:38,373 --> 00:05:41,169
THE FIRST ELECTRIC CAR IN
HISTORY

108
00:05:41,169 --> 00:05:44,677
TO BE FULLY
SELF-VANDALIZING.

109
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:49,219
WITH FEATURES LIKE SELF-SMASHING
HEADLIGHTS,

110
00:05:49,219 --> 00:05:51,916
SELF-SLASHING TIRES,

111
00:05:51,916 --> 00:05:55,120
AND A.I.-POWERED GRAFFITI.

112
00:05:55,120 --> 00:06:01,402
YOU CAN CHOOSE FROM PENISES OR
SWASTIKAS,

113
00:06:01,402 --> 00:06:06,029
OR MY FAVORITE,
SWASTIKAS MADE OUT OF PENISES.

114
00:06:07,233 --> 00:06:10,438
>> WOW.
SWASTIKAS OF PENISES,

115
00:06:10,438 --> 00:06:13,646
WE'RE
TRULY THE PARTY OF LINCOLN.

116
00:06:13,646 --> 00:06:17,582
>> BEFORE I GO, I WANT TO
MENTION I'M REALLY SMART

117
00:06:17,582 --> 00:06:19,574
AND
THESE TARIFFS SOUND REALLY DUMB.

118
00:06:19,574 --> 00:06:21,682
>> THANK YOU, ELON, GOOD LUCK
ON MARS.

119
00:06:21,682 --> 00:06:25,639
AND LIVE FROM NEW YORK IT'S
SATURDAY NIGHT!

120
00:08:32,582 --> 00:08:37,919
MUSICAL

121
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:41,713
BLACK!

122
00:08:45,598 --> 00:08:50,047
LADIES

123
00:09:07,032 --> 00:09:10,098
>>> OH, MY GOODNESS,

124
00:09:10,098 --> 00:09:15,651
THANK YOU.

125
00:09:15,651 --> 00:09:18,958
YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW MUCH THIS
MEANS TO ME.

126
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:21,508
I AM BACK!

127
00:09:24,396 --> 00:09:27,915
I'M HOSTING "SATURDAY NIGHT
LIVE"
FOR THE FOURTH TIME.

128
00:09:27,915 --> 00:09:33,169
FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO DON'T KNOW,
IT'S BEEN 20 YEARS SINCE I'VE
BEEN ON THIS STAGE.

129
00:09:33,619 --> 00:09:37,793
AND HONESTLY IT WAS AN ABSOLUTE
LIFE HIGHLIGHT.

130
00:09:37,793 --> 00:09:42,984
AND THAT'S WHY IT'S SO HARD
TO SAY WHAT I'M ABOUT TO SAY.

131
00:09:42,984 --> 00:09:44,681
BUT I QUIT.

132
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:50,393
I KNOW, IT'S THE FIRST TIME EVER
A HOST HAS QUIT IN THE MIDDLE OF
THE MONOLOGUE.

133
00:09:50,393 --> 00:09:53,366
IT'S KIND OF COOL, FIRST TIME
IT'S EVER HAPPENED.

134
00:09:53,366 --> 00:09:56,663
BUT I CAN'T DO IT.
IT'S TOO STRESSFUL

135
00:09:56,663 --> 00:09:59,865
AND
FRANKLY, I DON'T HAVE THE NERVE.

136
00:10:00,023 --> 00:10:02,860
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

137
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:05,472
WAIT A SECOND, MATTY NO.

138

HOW DARE YOU PLAY THAT RIFF,

139
00:10:08,331 --> 00:10:10,636
NOW I GET A MIC.

140
00:10:10,636 --> 00:10:15,048
YOU GUYS, YOU KNOW WHAT THIS
SONG DOES TO ME.

141
00:10:15,048 --> 00:10:19,386
IT GIVES ME THE POWER TO HOST
AGAIN.

142
00:10:19,386 --> 00:10:21,700
YEAH.

143
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:24,538

I THOUGHT YOU PUSHED IT TO BUZZ
IN.

230
00:16:04,196 --> 00:16:08,048
>> NO YOU DIDN'T THINK IT WAS TO
BUZZ IN, IT'S A WHIP.

231
00:16:08,048 --> 00:16:10,690
>> I DON'T CARE HOW HE'S
DRESSED.

232

I'M SORRY IF IT LOOKS LIKE
INDIANA JONES.
WHOEVER HE MAY BE.

239
00:16:31,494 --> 00:16:34,952

INDIANA?

240
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:36,154

245
00:16:48,172 --> 00:16:51,151
GENE, WHAT'S YOUR BIGGEST FEAR?

246
00:16:51,151 --> 00:16:53,844
>> GOT TO SAY SNAKES.

247
00:16:56,410 --> 00:16:58,248
>> YOU'RE PISSING ME OFF, BUDDY.

248
00:16:58,248 --> 00:17:01,465
>> SAY THAT TO MY WHIP.

249
00:17:01,902 --> 00:17:04,092

252
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:11,195
AND I MUST SAY IF YOU KEEP
TELLING HER WHAT HE LOOKS LIKE,

THIS SHOW WE'VE EVER HAD.

259
00:17:28,011 --> 00:17:29,963
>> JUST SHUT HIS DOOR.

260

SORRY, DIDN'T WANT IT TO GO IN
YOUR EYEBALLS.
SORRY.

756
00:51:04,841 --> 00:51:07,266
THAT'S ENOUGH CHAMPAGNE.

757
00:51:07,266 --> 00:51:09,881
>> WOW, THAT WAS SO ROMANTIC.

758
00:51:09,881 --> 00:51:12,264
>> FOR ME AS WELL.
KNOW WHY?

759
00:51:12,264 --> 00:51:19,669
¶ BECAUSE -- BECAUSE WE'RE
MAKIN' LOVE ¶

760
00:51:19,827 --> 00:51:23,967
¶ AND THEN WITHOUT EVEN SAYING A
WORD ¶

761
00:51:23,967 --> 00:51:27,708
¶ WE BOTH KNOW IT'S TIME TO
BRING IN A THIRD ¶

762
00:51:27,708 --> 00:51:30,778
¶ HELLO I'M HERE TO FIX YOUR PROBLEMS

763
00:51:30,778 --> 00:51:34,664
AND THIS WILL
DEFINITELY END WELL

764
00:51:34,664 --> 00:51:38,513
BECAUSE
BRINGING IN A THIRD
HAS NEVER NOT WORKED,

765
00:51:38,513 --> 00:51:41,773
SO
LISTEN UP, HERE'S THE PLAN ¶

766
00:51:41,773 --> 00:51:45,733
¶ WE DO ME AND HIM THEN HER AND
ME ¶

767
00:51:45,733 --> 00:51:49,527
¶ THEY SHE DOES HIM THEN SHE
DOES
ME ¶

768
00:51:49,527 --> 00:51:53,009
¶ THEN I GET JEALOUS AND I CRY
FOR A LITTLE ¶

769
00:51:53,009 --> 00:51:57,513
¶ SO WE GO OFF AND FIGHT IN THE
BATHROOM ¶

770
00:51:59,467 --> 00:52:02,718
>> WHY ARE YOU MAD, THIS WAS
YOUR IDEA?

771
00:52:02,718 --> 00:52:04,330
>> WELL NOW I FEEL WEIRD.

772
00:52:04,330 --> 00:52:06,129
I SHUNT HAVE BROUGHT SOMEONE
FROM WORK.

773
00:52:06,129 --> 00:52:10,095
HE'S GOING TO TELL EVERYONE HOW
LOVE I LOVE MAKE.

774
00:52:10,095 --> 00:52:12,115
>> HEY GUYS, I CAN HEAR YOU.

775
00:52:12,115 --> 00:52:14,798
SHOULD I JUST GO BACK TO
MIDTOWN?

776
00:52:14,798 --> 00:52:18,260
¶ IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT,
EVERYTHING WILL BE DANDY ¶

777
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:19,949
¶ IF WE BRING IN A FOURTH

778
00:52:19,949 --> 00:52:24,275
AND THE FOURTH IS BRANDI ¶

779
00:52:25,646 --> 00:52:28,962
>> BRANDI, GIVE US YOUR WISDOM.

780
00:52:28,962 --> 00:52:35,883
¶ WHAT YOU NEED IS TO LOVE EACH
OTHER DOWN ¶

781
00:52:36,166 --> 00:52:43,311
¶ YOU NEED TO LET YOUR LOVE FIRE
BURN ¶

782
00:52:43,311 --> 00:52:47,352
¶ THE TWO OF YOU GOT TO GET TOGETHER

783
00:52:47,352 --> 00:52:50,983
AND HOLD
EACH OTHER CLOSE

784
00:52:50,983 --> 00:52:53,584
AND ALWAYS REMEMBER

785
00:52:53,584 --> 00:52:55,812
TO TAKE TURNS ¶

786
00:52:55,812 --> 00:53:00,468
>> TAKE TURNS?
OH, BRANDI, THEY DON'T DO THAT,
YOU LESBUN.

787
00:53:00,468 --> 00:53:02,602
>> I TRIED.

788
00:53:03,057 --> 00:53:06,891
¶ THANKS FOR HAVING US IN THIS
LOVE PARADE ¶

789
00:53:06,891 --> 00:53:10,316
¶ ISN'T IT WEIRD THIS IS HOW
PEOPLE ARE MADE ¶

790
00:53:10,316 --> 00:53:13,644
¶ WELL YOU KNOW WHAT'S NEXT,

791
00:53:13,644 --> 00:53:17,193
WE GET TO DO THE ONE THING ¶
¶ THAT'S BETTER THAN SEX

792
00:53:17,193 --> 00:53:20,228
WE GET
TO LAY DOWN ¶

793
00:53:20,228 --> 00:53:24,001

794
00:53:24,001 --> 00:53:31,817
TV ¶¶

795
00:54:06,444 --> 00:54:09,380
HEY

WE ARE BIG RICKY AND THE
MINNOWS.

797
00:54:11,234 --> 00:54:14,261
EVERY SUNDAY WE HOST OUR POTLUCK JAM,

798
00:54:14,261 --> 00:54:16,769

804
00:54:31,430 --> 00:54:34,035
¶ SHE'S A GOOD GIRL

805
00:54:34,035 --> 00:54:36,587
WHO LOVES HER MAMMA,

00:54:36,587 --> 00:54:39,138
LOVES JESUS

807
00:54:39,138 --> 00:54:41,217
AND HER BOYFRIEND TOO ¶

808
00:54:41,217 --> 00:54:44,479
LOOK AT THIS, OUR FIRST JAMMER.

809
00:54:44,479 --> 00:54:46,118
NICE, A BASS.

810
00:54:46,118 --> 00:54:48,525
ASK AND YE SHALL RECEIVE.

811
00:54:48,525 --> 00:54:50,597
WHAT'S YOUR NAME MY MAN?
>> TRISH.

812
00:54:50,597 --> 00:54:53,035
>> YOU KNOW THIS ONE, DIVE IN.

813
00:54:53,035 --> 00:54:54,788
TWO, FOUR.

814
00:54:54,788 --> 00:54:59,819
¶ IT'S A LONG DAY LIVING IN
RESEDA ¶

815
00:54:59,819 --> 00:55:02,883
OH, THAT BASS FEELS GOOD, YEAH.

816
00:55:02,883 --> 00:55:04,980
¶ RUNNING THROUGH THE YARD ¶

817
00:55:04,980 --> 00:55:07,020
>> WHAT DO WE HAVE HERE,

818
00:55:07,020 --> 00:55:09,658
NO SHIRT, NO SHOES AND A BASS.

819
00:55:09,658 --> 00:55:11,976
ARE WE
DEALING WITH A DOUBLE BASS
SANDWICH?

820
00:55:11,976 --> 00:55:13,472
RIGHT ON, MY MAN.

821
00:55:13,472 --> 00:55:16,690
ALSO IS THAT A McDONALD'S NUMBER
TWO ON YOUR CHEST?

822
00:55:16,690 --> 00:55:19,444
>> YEAH, I'M LOVING IT.

00:55:21,291 --> 00:55:23,501
TWO, THREE, FOUR.

825
00:55:23,501 --> 00:55:25,731
¶ I'M A BAD BOY

826
00:55:25,731 --> 00:55:28,579
BECAUSE I DON'T EVEN MISS HER ¶

827
00:55:28,579 --> 00:55:31,074
¶ I'M A BAD BOY

828
00:55:31,074 --> 00:55:33,508
FOR BREAKING HER HEART ¶

829
00:55:33,508 --> 00:55:36,641
WOW, NOW IT'S AN EMBARRASSMENT
OF BASSES.

830
00:55:36,641 --> 00:55:39,493
>> WOO, I LOVE YOU BIG RICKY.

831
00:55:39,493 --> 00:55:43,944
>> HELLO.
LOOKS LIKE OUR SWEET JAM HAS
SUMMONED A SIREN.

832
00:55:43,944 --> 00:55:45,872
ARE YOU FRESH OUT OF THE LAKE,
DARLIN'?

833
00:55:45,872 --> 00:55:48,900
>> YEAH, JUST KILLING TIMES
BEFORE THE BOOB CONTEST.

834
00:55:48,900 --> 00:55:51,705
>> LET'S GET THIS WET SEAL A
TAMBOURINE.

835
00:55:51,705 --> 00:55:54,097
>> I PLAY BASS.

836
00:55:54,097 --> 00:55:56,415
>> ANOTHER BASS,

837
00:55:56,415 --> 00:55:59,055
NOT SURE THERE'S MORE REAL ESTATE LEFT ON
THE AMP.

838
00:55:59,055 --> 00:56:01,486
>> I'LL FIND AN OPEN SOCKET.

839
00:56:02,505 --> 00:56:04,329
>> SHE'S SLAPPING IT.

840
00:56:04,329 --> 00:56:07,637
I GUESS BASS WAS NEVER MISSING
FROM THIS SONG.

841
00:56:07,637 --> 00:56:10,423
KIND OF CHANGES OF VIBE OF "FREE
FALLIN'".

842
00:56:10,423 --> 00:56:13,172
EDDIE, YOU THINK TOM PETTY IS
LIKING THIS?

843
00:56:13,299 --> 00:56:15,994
>> I DO NOT.
>> ALL GOOD.

844
00:56:15,994 --> 00:56:18,986
LET'S HIT THE CHORUS.
THREE, FOUR

845
00:56:18,986 --> 00:56:21,365
¶ AND I'M FREE,

846
00:56:23,915 --> 00:56:26,905
FREE FALLIN' YEAH ¶

847
00:56:26,905 --> 00:56:31,200
IT'S ALL GOOD BUT PROBABLY HIT
OUR QUOTA ON BASS.

848
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:34,279
QUALITY OF THE SOUND FEELS LIKE
A SINUS INFECTION.

849
00:56:34,279 --> 00:56:37,114
ALL INSTRUMENTS ARE WELCOME BUT
IF YOU GOT A BASS,

850
00:56:37,114 --> 00:56:39,611
SIT THIS ONE
OUT.
WE'LL GET YOU NEXT TIME.

851
00:56:39,611 --> 00:56:43,832
WE'RE BIG RICKY AND THE MINNOWS
AND WE'RE GOOD ON BASS.

852
00:56:43,832 --> 00:56:46,783
SPOON MAN, YEAH,

853
00:56:46,783 --> 00:56:49,136
WE CAN USE SOME PERCUSSION.
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

854
00:56:49,136 --> 00:56:51,750
>> GIVEN OR STAGE?
>> STAGE.

855
00:56:51,750 --> 00:56:54,299
>> MY NAME IS KEVIN BASS-Y.

856
00:56:54,299 --> 00:56:57,894
>> YOWCH, THAT'S DISAPPOINTING
ON TWO LEVELS.

857
00:56:57,894 --> 00:57:00,143
WHAT WERE THE SPOONS FOR?

858
00:57:00,143 --> 00:57:02,071
>> THESE SPOONS ARE FOR CRACK.

859
00:57:02,071 --> 00:57:03,868
>> SON OF A BITCH!

860
00:57:03,868 --> 00:57:05,537
THREE, FOUR.

861
00:57:05,537 --> 00:57:08,130
¶ I'M FREE ¶

862
00:57:10,395 --> 00:57:13,249
YEAH, I'M HAVING A HARD TIME
HEARING THE MELODY

863
00:57:13,249 --> 00:57:15,956
LOST IN THE
CORN MAZE OF BASS.

864
00:57:15,956 --> 00:57:18,751
ANYBODY ELSE'S TEETH RATTLING?

865
00:57:19,291 --> 00:57:22,201
LOOKS LIKE THE AMP IS THROWING
SPARKS.

866
00:57:22,201 --> 00:57:25,991
TO THE GIRL DRIPPING WETTING
MAYBE GIVE THAT THING SOME ROOM.

867
00:57:25,991 --> 00:57:29,596
SHE'S NOODLING OVER THE AMP, NOT
A SMART GIRL.

868
00:57:29,596 --> 00:57:33,403
LOOK, IT'S MIKE, THE OWNER OF
THE BASS BAR.

869
00:57:33,403 --> 00:57:36,592
NOT A MOMENT
TOO SOON, WE COULD USE A
KEYBOARD.

870
00:57:36,592 --> 00:57:40,335
>> NO, THIS IS A CARRYING CASE
FOR MY BASS.

871
00:57:40,335 --> 00:57:41,261
>> WHAT?

872
00:57:41,261 --> 00:57:44,438
A KEYBOARD SHAPED BASS CASE FOR
A BASS?

873
00:57:44,438 --> 00:57:45,597
DAMN IT!

874
00:57:45,597 --> 00:57:50,620
THIS IS LIKE GOING TO A COOKOUT
AND EVERYBODY BROUGHT QUINOA.

875
00:57:50,620 --> 00:57:52,021
>> THAT'S A GOOD ONE BOSS.

876
00:57:52,021 --> 00:57:54,268
>> WHERE DID YOU GET THAT?

877
00:57:54,268 --> 00:57:56,675
>> WHATEVER, LET'S KEEP JAMMING,

878
00:57:56,675 --> 00:57:58,967
THREE, FOUR.

879
00:58:01,267 --> 00:58:04,744
IS THAT "THE SIMPSONS" THEME?
GOD DAMN IT.

880
00:58:04,825 --> 00:58:08,323
THIS IS TOO MUCH BASS, CAN
ANYBODY MAKE ANOTHER SOUND?

881
00:58:08,323 --> 00:58:10,503
MA'AM, CAN YOU
MAKE YOUR DOG BARK.

882
00:58:10,503 --> 00:58:13,488
>> NO, HE'S MUTE BUT HE'S A
BASS-ET HOUND.

883
00:58:13,488 --> 00:58:17,058
>> DON'T TELL ME THAT DOG PLAYS
BASS.

884
00:58:18,599 --> 00:58:22,378
I SAID WE DON'T NEED BASS AND
PEOPLE KEEP BRINGING BASS.

885
00:58:22,378 --> 00:58:25,583
SO HOW ABOUT THIS, WE WANT MORE
BASS.

886
00:58:25,828 --> 00:58:29,554
NO!
THIS IS TOO MUCH BASS.

887
00:58:29,554 --> 00:58:33,171
THE FREQUENCIES COULD ENDANGER
THE INTEGRITY OF THE PIER.

888
00:58:33,171 --> 00:58:37,013
>> IF WE'RE GOING DOWN, LET'S GO
DOWN JAMMING.

889
00:58:37,013 --> 00:58:38,883
>> EDDIE, YOU'RE SO RIGHT.

890
00:58:38,883 --> 00:58:41,742
EVERYBODY, LET'S JAM.
THREE FOUR.

891
00:58:41,742 --> 00:58:44,483
¶ I'M FREE,

892
00:58:46,771 --> 00:58:50,542
FREE FALLIN' ¶

893
00:59:05,922 --> 00:59:10,550
AGAIN

894
00:59:10,551 --> 00:59:16,785
Who Believes in Angels?

895
00:59:27,544 --> 00:59:31,516
¶ YOU DON'T NEED TO
LAUGH SO HARD

896
00:59:31,516 --> 00:59:35,132
YOU DON'T HAVE TO
WEAR A TIE ¶

897
00:59:35,132 --> 00:59:37,236
¶ SOMETIMES HONEST

898
00:59:37,236 --> 00:59:42,066
IS BEING CAUGHT
INSIDE A LIE ¶

899
00:59:42,308 --> 00:59:45,380
¶ AND I HAVE BEEN THERE

900
00:59:45,903 --> 00:59:49,413
I HAVE BEEN THERE ¶

901
00:59:50,192 --> 00:59:54,280
¶ IF I'D LIVED AN EASY LIFE

902
00:59:54,280 --> 00:59:56,246
WOULD I STILL CHOOSE YOU

903
00:59:56,246 --> 00:59:58,552
WOULD I FALL ON
THE SAME KNIFE ¶

904
00:59:58,552 --> 01:00:00,444
¶ A RODEO QUEEN

905
01:00:00,444 --> 01:00:04,870
BREATHING
FIRE INTO THE NIGHT ¶

906
01:00:05,099 --> 01:00:08,346
¶ I HAVE BEEN THERE

907
01:00:08,346 --> 01:00:12,146
MAN I'VE BEEN THERE ¶

908
01:00:12,500 --> 01:00:20,069
¶ WHAT DO YOU SAY WE SET
THE PLEASANTRIES ASIDE ¶

909
01:00:20,069 --> 01:00:27,352
¶ EVEN THE DIAMONDS
LOOK LIKE ROCKS

THE NURSE?

973
01:05:51,523 --> 01:05:53,938

NOT WITH A
GUN BUT I SERVED.

PROPAGANDA CARTOONS ABOUT THE JAPANESE EMPEROR,

983

>> AND I AM SO PROUD OF YOU
HONEY.

JOINED THE ARMY BECAUSE OF MY
RACIST CARTOONS?

UP.

995
01:06:53,911 --> 01:06:56,852
NOT FOREVER, JUST FOR NOW, WE'RE
BREAKING UP UNTIL THIS KISS ENDS

996
01:06:56,852 --> 01:06:59,711
BECAUSE WHEN IT DOES, YOU'RE
WITH ME.

997
01:07:00,236 --> 01:07:04,409
