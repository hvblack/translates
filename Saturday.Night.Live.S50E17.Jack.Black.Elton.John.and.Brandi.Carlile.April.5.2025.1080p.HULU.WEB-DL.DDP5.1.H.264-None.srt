1
00:00:00,656 --> 00:00:04,004
>>> ON WEDNESDAY, PRESIDENT
TRUMP GIVES A SPEECH IN THE ROSE
GARDEN

2
00:00:04,004 --> 00:00:06,337
ABOUT HIS ECONOMIC VISION FOR AMERICA,

3
00:00:06,337 --> 00:00:10,165
INCLUDING TARIFFS
AGAINST ALMOST EVERY COUNTRY WE
DO BUSINESS WITH.

4
00:00:10,165 --> 00:00:13,246
AND LIKE EVERYTHING SO FAR IN HIS PRESIDENCY,

5
00:00:13,246 --> 00:00:15,381
IT WAS A TOTAL
HOME RUN.

6
00:00:15,381 --> 00:00:17,447
WE GO NOW TO AN ENCORE
PRESENTATION

7
00:00:17,447 --> 00:00:20,711
OF TRUMP'S
HISTORICALLY AWESOME
SPEECH.

8
00:00:21,311 --> 00:00:23,545
THANK

9
00:00:23,545 --> 00:00:27,085
THANK YOU ALL FOR COMING OUT
TO HEAR ABOUT TARIFFS.

10
00:00:27,085 --> 00:00:29,017
MY FAVORITE WORD, TARIFF.

11
00:00:29,017 --> 00:00:32,812
WHICH OF COURSE IS SHORT FOR
TARIFFIC IDEA.

12
00:00:32,812 --> 00:00:36,625
THEY'RE THE BACKBONE OF MY
INCREDIBLE PLAN FOR OUR ECONOMY.

13
00:00:36,625 --> 00:00:40,782
IT'S ACTUALLY BETTER THAN A PLAN
BECAUSE IT'S A SERIES OF RANDOM
NUMBERS.

14
00:00:40,782 --> 00:00:45,280
LIKE THE
NUMBERS ON COMPUTER SCREENS IN
SEVERANCE.

15
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:49,915
YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THE HELL
THEY MEAN, BUT
I KNOW WHAT THE NUMBERS MEAN.
OKAY?

16
00:00:49,915 --> 00:00:53,370
THEY MEAN
WE'RE GOING TO MAKE AMERICA
WEALTHY AGAIN, OKAY?

17
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:55,392
MAWA,

18
00:00:55,392 --> 00:00:57,256
MAWA. BROING

19
00:00:57,256 --> 00:01:00,340
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE GOING TO CHECK
YOUR STOCK PORTFOLIO IN
A COUPLE OF DAYS

20
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:04,717
AND THINK I'M
ALMOST TOO WEALTHY, MAWA.

21
00:01:04,717 --> 00:01:08,477
BEFORE THAT, WE'RE GOING TO DO
MAGDA.

22
00:01:08,477 --> 00:01:13,520
MAGDA,
MAKE AMERICA GREAT DEPRESSION
AGAIN.

23
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,931
IT WILL BE BETTER THAN GREAT,

24
00:01:15,931 --> 00:01:18,876
A FANTASTIC, UNBELIEVABLE
DEPRESSION.

25
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,954
THE LIKES OF WHICH WE'VE NEVER
SEEN BEFORE.

26
00:01:21,954 --> 00:01:25,209
WE LOVE TO SAY THE LIKES OF
WHICH WE NEVER HAVE SEEN BEFORE.

27
00:01:25,209 --> 00:01:27,384
YOU KNOW, THIS DEPRESSION IS
GOING TO BE SO GREAT.

28
00:01:27,384 --> 00:01:31,139
WE'LL BE THE ONES EATING CATS
AND DOGS.
AND THAT'S FUN, FOLKS.

29
00:01:31,139 --> 00:01:34,581
LOW AND SLOW, BRAISE THEM, YOU
KNOW.

30
00:01:34,581 --> 00:01:37,948
THE STOCK MARKET HAS CRASHED
TEMPORARILY,

31
00:01:37,948 --> 00:01:40,843
BUT THAT'S ALL PART OF THE PLAN,

32
00:01:40,843 --> 00:01:42,783
IT'S SIMPLE
ECONOMICS.

33
00:01:42,783 --> 00:01:47,030
IF THE STOCK MARKET GOES DOWN
AND DOWN AND DOWN,

34
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:51,232
IT MEANS IT
HAS NOWHERE TO GO BUT UP.
OR PERHAPS FURTHER DOWN.

35
00:01:51,232 --> 00:01:54,303
WE GOT TO DO THESE TARIFFS,
FOLKS, WE HAVE TO.

36
00:01:54,303 --> 00:01:56,571
NO IDEA WHY BUT WE'VE GOT TO DO
THEM.

37
00:01:56,571 --> 00:02:00,319
NOW IT'S TIME FOR THE REALLY BIG
PIECE OF CARDBOARD.

38
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:02,393
HOWARD, YOU WANT TO BRING IT UP?

39
00:02:02,393 --> 00:02:04,862
THIS IS WONDERFUL, MY COMMERCE SECRETARY

40
00:02:04,862 --> 00:02:07,124
HOWARD LUTNICK
EVERYBODY, THANK YOU.

41
00:02:07,124 --> 00:02:10,928
NOW WE'VE GOT THE BIG CARDBOARD,
THIS IS GREAT.

42
00:02:14,058 --> 00:02:17,636
YOU KNOW WHAT, THIS IS A
CHEESECAKE FACTORY MENU.
THAT'S FOR THE LUNCH AFTER.

43
00:02:17,636 --> 00:02:19,156
I'M GETTING BANG BANG TACOS.

44
00:02:19,156 --> 00:02:20,897
GIVE

45
00:02:20,897 --> 00:02:25,112
THANKS HOWARD, YOU'RE DOING A
GREAT JOB TO FIGURE OUT THE
SCARY TARIFFS.

46
00:02:25,112 --> 00:02:28,756
WOULD YOU LIKE TO BE FACE OF THE
TARIFFS WITH ME?

47
00:02:28,756 --> 00:02:30,867
>> NO, I'M GOOD.

48
00:02:30,867 --> 00:02:33,386
>> HE'S A MODEST GUY.

49
00:02:33,386 --> 00:02:35,977
HERE IT IS.
LOOK AT THIS, THAT'S SO
BEAUTIFUL.

50
00:02:35,977 --> 00:02:37,609
WE SPENT SO MUCH TIME,

51
00:02:37,609 --> 00:02:40,892
FRANKLY MILLIONS
OF DOLLARS, FRANKLY, ON THIS
PIECE OF CARDBOARD.

52
00:02:41,012 --> 00:02:45,254
WE LISTED THE COUNTRIES IN AN
ORDER THAT'S NEITHER
ALPHABETICAL NOR NUMERICAL

53
00:02:45,254 --> 00:02:48,426
FOR
MAXIMUM CONFUSION.

54
00:02:48,426 --> 00:02:51,203
AND THE TARIFFS WILL BE
RECIPROCAL.

55
00:02:51,203 --> 00:02:53,262
WE LOVE THE WORD RECIPROCAL,

56
00:02:53,262 --> 00:02:57,174
EXCEPT IN THE BEDROOM, RIGHT
FELLOWS?
YOU WANT ME TO DO WHAT?

57
00:02:57,174 --> 00:03:00,802
GUYS KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING
ABOUT.

58
00:03:00,802 --> 00:03:03,822
SOME PEOPLE SAY MY PLAN IS NONSENSE

59
00:03:03,822 --> 00:03:07,699
BUT WE'RE USING A
FORMULA, THEY CALL IT FORMULA,

60
00:03:07,699 --> 00:03:10,982
IT'S COMPLICATED BUT LET ME
EXPLAIN HOW IT WORKS.

61
00:03:10,982 --> 00:03:12,298
GIVE ME THAT.

62
00:03:13,148 --> 00:03:16,345
ALL RIGHT.
SO THAT'S A TRIANGLE.

63
00:03:16,345 --> 00:03:18,375
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT IS.

64
00:03:18,375 --> 00:03:21,409
UP HERE, XI, FROM CHINA.

65
00:03:21,409 --> 00:03:24,805
AND THAT'S MI STABBING HIM WITH
A SWORD.

66
00:03:24,805 --> 00:03:27,852
AND THEN DOWN HERE THERE'S SOME
SIDEWAYS BOOBS.

67
00:03:27,852 --> 00:03:29,025
YOU GET IT.

68
00:03:29,025 --> 00:03:32,365
YOUR MONEY IS GONE, THAT'S THE
OKAY, WE'RE GOING TO FIGURE IT
OUT.

69
00:03:32,365 --> 00:03:35,017
NO COUNTRY IS SAFE FROM MY
TARIFFS.

70
00:03:35,017 --> 00:03:38,656
I EVEN PUT TARIFFS ON AN ISLAND
UNINHABITED BY HUMANS.

71
00:03:38,656 --> 00:03:41,213
IT'S CALLED HEARD & McDONALD
ISLAND.

72
00:03:41,213 --> 00:03:45,365
McDONALD ISLAND,
I WOULD LOVE TO VISIT THERE.
RIGHT?

73
00:03:45,365 --> 00:03:49,500
CAN YOU IMAGINE THAT?
BIG MAC AND A HULA SKIRT.
OOH LA LA.

74
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:52,716
I HAD THEM MOCK UP McDONALD
ISLAND.

75
00:03:52,716 --> 00:03:54,782
WOULD YOU BRING IT UP?

76
00:03:54,782 --> 00:03:56,431
THERE YOU GO.

77
00:03:56,431 --> 00:03:59,287
WANT

78
00:03:59,287 --> 00:04:02,880
GET ME TO GOD'S COUNTRY, RIGHT?

79
00:04:04,508 --> 00:04:06,665
REMEMBER THAT?

80
00:04:06,822 --> 00:04:09,938
THE POINT IS EVERYTHING
IS GOING TO BE FINE,

81
00:04:09,938 --> 00:04:11,568
AND/OR BAD.

82
00:04:11,568 --> 00:04:13,817
EVERYBODY IS WORRIED ABOUT
PRICES GOING UP,

83
00:04:13,817 --> 00:04:17,971
ESPECIALLY THE
PRICE OF GROKERIES.
AM I SAYING THAT RIGHT?

84
00:04:17,971 --> 00:04:20,949
FOOD FROM THE GROKERIE STORE.

85
00:04:20,949 --> 00:04:22,999
OLD FASHIONED TERM.

86
00:04:22,999 --> 00:04:26,919
WE NEED TO SEND A MESSAGE TO
COUNTRIES RIPPING US OFF,

87
00:04:26,919 --> 00:04:32,083
SOUTH
AFRICA PUTS A 60% TARIFF ON
EVERYTHING WE SEND THEM

88
00:04:32,083 --> 00:04:35,630
AND
THEY'VE NEVER SENT US ONE GOOD
THING.

89
00:04:35,987 --> 00:04:38,508
>> WHAT ABOUT ME?

90
00:04:40,183 --> 00:04:42,501
>> SAY CHEESE!

91
00:04:42,501 --> 00:04:44,846
KIDDING.

92
00:04:44,846 --> 00:04:46,975
COME ON, COMEDY!

93
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:53,643
THAT IS FROM WHEN I TRIED TO BUY
THE ELECTION IN WISCONSIN.

94
00:04:53,784 --> 00:04:57,447
I'M AN IDIOT, I SHOULD HAVE JUST
BOUGHT WISCONSIN.

95
00:04:57,745 --> 00:04:59,547
GLITCH.

96
00:05:02,602 --> 00:05:06,581
PIN-WHEEL, PIN-WHEEL, PIN-WHEEL.

97
00:05:06,581 --> 00:05:08,626
AND I'M BACK.

98
00:05:08,626 --> 00:05:11,362
>> ELON IS GREAT BUT SADLY,

99
00:05:11,362 --> 00:05:13,778
IT'S TIME TO NEVER SEE YOU AGAIN,
OKAY?

100
00:05:13,778 --> 00:05:17,599
YOU'VE GOT TO GET BACK TO TESS
TESLA BECAUSE THEY'RE DOING
PRETTY BAD.

101
00:05:17,599 --> 00:05:20,733
>> YES, AND RECENTLY OUR
DEALERSHIPS HAVE

102
00:05:20,733 --> 00:05:23,446
BEEN THE
TARGETS OF MANY ATTACKS.

103
00:05:23,446 --> 00:05:26,895
SUDDENLY NO ONE LIKES TESLA
CARS.

104
00:05:26,895 --> 00:05:29,235
I ASKED MYSELF WHY,

105
00:05:29,235 --> 00:05:32,318
THEN I ANSWERED MYSELF, BECAUSE OF ME.

106
00:05:32,318 --> 00:05:38,373
WHICH IS WHY WE ARE INTRODUCING
THE NEW TESLA MODEL-V.

107
00:05:38,373 --> 00:05:41,169
THE FIRST ELECTRIC CAR IN
HISTORY

108
00:05:41,169 --> 00:05:44,677
TO BE FULLY
SELF-VANDALIZING.

109
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:49,219
WITH FEATURES LIKE SELF-SMASHING
HEADLIGHTS,

110
00:05:49,219 --> 00:05:51,916
SELF-SLASHING TIRES,

111
00:05:51,916 --> 00:05:55,120
AND A.I.-POWERED GRAFFITI.

112
00:05:55,120 --> 00:06:01,402
YOU CAN CHOOSE FROM PENISES OR
SWASTIKAS,

113
00:06:01,402 --> 00:06:06,029
OR MY FAVORITE,
SWASTIKAS MADE OUT OF PENISES.

114
00:06:07,233 --> 00:06:10,438
>> WOW.
SWASTIKAS OF PENISES,

115
00:06:10,438 --> 00:06:13,646
WE'RE
TRULY THE PARTY OF LINCOLN.

116
00:06:13,646 --> 00:06:17,582
>> BEFORE I GO, I WANT TO
MENTION I'M REALLY SMART

117
00:06:17,582 --> 00:06:19,574
AND
THESE TARIFFS SOUND REALLY DUMB.

118
00:06:19,574 --> 00:06:21,682
>> THANK YOU, ELON, GOOD LUCK
ON MARS.

119
00:06:21,682 --> 00:06:25,639
AND LIVE FROM NEW YORK IT'S
SATURDAY NIGHT!

120
00:08:32,582 --> 00:08:37,919
MUSICAL

121
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:41,713
BLACK!

122
00:08:45,598 --> 00:08:50,047
LADIES

123
00:09:07,032 --> 00:09:10,098
>>> OH, MY GOODNESS,

124
00:09:10,098 --> 00:09:15,651
THANK YOU.

125
00:09:15,651 --> 00:09:18,958
YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW MUCH THIS
MEANS TO ME.

126
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:21,508
I AM BACK!

127
00:09:24,396 --> 00:09:27,915
I'M HOSTING "SATURDAY NIGHT
LIVE"
FOR THE FOURTH TIME.

128
00:09:27,915 --> 00:09:33,169
FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO DON'T KNOW,
IT'S BEEN 20 YEARS SINCE I'VE
BEEN ON THIS STAGE.

129
00:09:33,619 --> 00:09:37,793
AND HONESTLY IT WAS AN ABSOLUTE
LIFE HIGHLIGHT.

130
00:09:37,793 --> 00:09:42,984
AND THAT'S WHY IT'S SO HARD
TO SAY WHAT I'M ABOUT TO SAY.

131
00:09:42,984 --> 00:09:44,681
BUT I QUIT.

132
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:50,393
I KNOW, IT'S THE FIRST TIME EVER
A HOST HAS QUIT IN THE MIDDLE OF
THE MONOLOGUE.

133
00:09:50,393 --> 00:09:53,366
IT'S KIND OF COOL, FIRST TIME
IT'S EVER HAPPENED.

134
00:09:53,366 --> 00:09:56,663
BUT I CAN'T DO IT.
IT'S TOO STRESSFUL

135
00:09:56,663 --> 00:09:59,925
AND
FRANKLY, I DON'T HAVE THE NERVE.

136
00:10:00,003 --> 00:10:02,860
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

137
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:05,472
WAIT A SECOND, MATTY NO.

138
00:10:05,472 --> 00:10:08,331
HOW DARE YOU PLAY THAT RIFF,

139
00:10:08,331 --> 00:10:10,551
NOW I GET A MIC.

140
00:10:10,636 --> 00:10:15,048
YOU GUYS, YOU KNOW WHAT THIS
SONG DOES TO ME.

141
00:10:15,048 --> 00:10:19,386
IT GIVES ME THE POWER TO HOST
AGAIN.

142
00:10:19,386 --> 00:10:21,700
YEAH.

143
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:24,538

I THOUGHT YOU PUSHED IT TO BUZZ
IN.

230
00:16:04,196 --> 00:16:08,048
>> NO YOU DIDN'T THINK IT WAS TO
BUZZ IN, IT'S A WHIP.

231
00:16:08,048 --> 00:16:10,690
>> I DON'T CARE HOW HE'S
DRESSED.

232

I'M SORRY IF IT LOOKS LIKE
INDIANA JONES.
WHOEVER HE MAY BE.

239
00:16:31,494 --> 00:16:34,952

INDIANA?

240
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:36,154

245
00:16:48,172 --> 00:16:51,125
GENE, WHAT'S YOUR BIGGEST FEAR?

246
00:16:51,201 --> 00:16:53,844
>> GOT TO SAY SNAKES.

247
00:16:56,410 --> 00:16:58,248
>> YOU'RE PISSING ME OFF, BUDDY.

248
00:16:58,248 --> 00:17:01,465
>> SAY THAT TO MY WHIP.

249
00:17:01,902 --> 00:17:04,092

252
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:11,195
AND I MUST SAY IF YOU KEEP
TELLING HER WHAT HE LOOKS LIKE,

253

THIS SHOW WE'VE EVER HAD.

258

>> TELL THAT TO MY WHIP!

259
00:17:28,011 --> 00:17:29,963
>> JUST SHUT HIS DOOR.

260

DAMN IT!

1117
00:57:55,756 --> 00:58:00,359
