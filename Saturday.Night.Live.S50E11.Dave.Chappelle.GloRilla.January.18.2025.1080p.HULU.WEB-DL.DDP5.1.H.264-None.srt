1
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:12,947
Hello.

2
00:00:12,947 --> 00:00:16,130
Hello and welcome to MSNBC.

3
00:00:16,130 --> 00:00:18,430
I'm Rachel Maddow.

4
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:22,242
And, dads, you better
hide your older bookish
lesbian daughters,

5
00:00:22,242 --> 00:00:25,798
because,
uh, yeah, I'm back on TV.

6
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:29,995
Tonight, for our special Inauguration
Weekend coverage,

7
00:00:29,995 --> 00:00:33,275
I'm joined by our panel
of MSNBC hosts,

8
00:00:33,275 --> 00:00:36,250
basically like the
Avengers for your aunt.

9
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:39,430
- It's Ari Melber.
- Thanks, Rachel.

10
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:41,680
-
- Glad to be here.

11
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:45,110
- Stephanie Ruhle.
- Hey, girlfriend.

12
00:00:45,268 --> 00:00:50,150
And finally, Chris Hayes, a.k.a.
Woke Sheldon.

13
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:53,313
Okay.
Drag me, mama.

14
00:00:53,313 --> 00:00:55,970
Well, tonight, we have a lot of news to
cover.

15
00:00:55,970 --> 00:00:59,731
The LEA wildfires are affecting thousands.

16
00:00:59,731 --> 00:01:02,943
The TikTok ban goes into effect tomorrow.

17
00:01:02,943 --> 00:01:05,730
And the Inauguration is only two days
away.

18
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:07,303
What's your take, Ari?

19
00:01:07,303 --> 00:01:11,071
Well, in the words of the great poet DMX,

20
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:14,423
y'all gonna make me lose my mind.

21
00:01:14,423 --> 00:01:17,773
Up and here.
Up and here.

22
00:01:17,773 --> 00:01:19,310
What about you, Stephanie?

23
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:23,580
I mean, Trump is already talking about
invading Canada and Greenland.

24
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:26,638
Is he serious, or is that one of his
distractions?

25
00:01:26,638 --> 00:01:27,970
I mean, what do you think, Joy?

26
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:32,970
I don't know.
I can't tell if you're doing the news or
trying to hook up.

27
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:35,461
What do you think, Rachel?

28
00:01:35,668 --> 00:01:38,420
Oh, I'm not Rachel.

29
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:40,983
I'm Chris Hayes.

30
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:44,684
One thing I do know is, this
time around,

31
00:01:44,684 --> 00:01:48,490
we're not gonna get sucked in by every new
shiny, crazy statement from Trump.

32
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:52,126
We need to focus on what he does,
not what he says.

33
00:01:52,126 --> 00:01:54,912
Uh, I'm sorry.
I have to interrupt you.

34
00:01:54,912 --> 00:01:56,430
We have some breaking news.

35
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:59,134
Trump has apparently
just told reporters

36
00:01:59,134 --> 00:02:03,610
that he would like to, quote,
trade Connecticut for Italy.

37
00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:05,530
I mean, that's just crazy.

38
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:10,382
Rachel, Rachel, see, this is what I mean.
We can't have a repeat of 2016.

39
00:02:10,382 --> 00:02:15,490
Exactly.
Uh, in his first term, the media was like,
look at him.

40
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:18,580
Walking around, grabbing his
you-know-what.

41
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:20,670
Flipping the you-know-who.

42
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:23,910
Tick-a-ticka, Slim Shady.

43
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:26,761
But this time, we're gonna
focus on what matters,

44
00:02:26,761 --> 00:02:29,535
like tech billionaires
buying our democracy.

45
00:02:29,535 --> 00:02:32,585
Sorry, Ari, we're getting breaking news

46
00:02:32,585 --> 00:02:35,421
that Trump just told a group of wildfire victims

47
00:02:35,421 --> 00:02:37,880
that, quote, Arnold Palmer

48
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:42,488
had some
of the longest balls in American history.

49
00:02:42,488 --> 00:02:44,018
You see, this is what he does.

50
00:02:44,018 --> 00:02:48,231
To keep us from talking about disaster
relief or the impacts of climate change...

51
00:02:48,231 --> 00:02:51,027
And I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Rachel.

52
00:02:51,027 --> 00:02:52,784
I am Chris.

53
00:02:52,784 --> 00:02:56,764
But... But apparently Trump
just tweeted about the fires.

54
00:02:56,764 --> 00:03:01,430
A picture of himself as the
guy from Up with the caption,

55
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:06,053
I would end fire by filling the
up house with water balloons.

56
00:03:06,053 --> 00:03:07,772
Wow.
Joy,

57
00:03:07,772 --> 00:03:13,684
this man, this man, this man was
designed by the devil to break my spirit.

58
00:03:13,684 --> 00:03:17,270
You can just call me Ann Reed,
because the joy is gone.

59
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:21,290
You know, I gotta say, you forget about
the pace of the news under Trump.

60
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:24,654
It's so hard to get your bearings,
right, Rach?

61
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:30,850
Please don't put your glasses in my mouth.

62
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:36,549
Thankfully, here to get us back...
Here to get us back on track is MSNBC...

63
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:41,830
MSNBC everything correspondent,
Claire McCaskill.

64
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:43,130
Hi, Rachel.

65
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:45,070
Claire, throw us a lifeline.

66
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:48,867
Can you please say something of substance
about this week?

67
00:03:48,867 --> 00:03:50,739
Of course.

68
00:03:50,739 --> 00:03:54,912
And hold that thought, Rachel,
because somehow I'm getting breaking news

69
00:03:54,912 --> 00:03:58,320
that Trump just said he is
sending Don Jr. to

70
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:02,262
explore the possibility of
purchasing the Emerald City.

71
00:04:02,262 --> 00:04:05,463
Oh, seems like he finally saw Wicked.

72
00:04:05,757 --> 00:04:08,080
Oh, he did.

73
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,231
And he loved Wicked.

74
00:04:10,231 --> 00:04:12,902
...and just now realizing

75
00:04:12,902 --> 00:04:16,733
that he thinks
the Emerald City is Greenland.

76
00:04:16,733 --> 00:04:19,183
Speaking of, uh,
Wicked,

77
00:04:19,183 --> 00:04:22,173
I believe it was Will Smith who said,

78
00:04:22,173 --> 00:04:25,230
Wiki Wiki Wild Wild West.

79
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:28,155
Jim West, Desperado.

80
00:04:28,155 --> 00:04:30,392
Something to think about.

81
00:04:30,694 --> 00:04:34,040
Okay, we just got word that
President Trump has tweeted

82
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:37,968
that he has agreed to meet with
Chinese President Xi Jinping.

83
00:04:37,968 --> 00:04:39,450
Oh, that's not that bad.

84
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:42,789
In the octagon at UFC fight.

85
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:48,600
You know what?
I'm just gonna take the reins and talk
about a real story, okay?

86
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,831
Trump's tariffs for Canada?

87
00:04:50,831 --> 00:04:53,912
Look, Quebec supplies two-thirds of our
raw aluminum.

88
00:04:53,912 --> 00:04:58,771
And when you consider the importments and
the importance of hydroelectric power...

89
00:04:58,771 --> 00:05:00,912
Oh, my God.
I-I can't even finish.

90
00:05:00,912 --> 00:05:03,150
That is so boring.
I'm sorry.

91
00:05:04,547 --> 00:05:06,376
Oh, my God!

92
00:05:06,376 --> 00:05:10,460
Yeah, and, uh, America has just declared
war on sharks.

93
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:13,320
That's good.
That's good.
Much better.

94
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:17,569
Also, Trump apparently just gave a
statement about the TikTok ban.

95
00:05:17,569 --> 00:05:21,380
I can pretend I'm not curious,
but, uh, let's just watch the whole thing.

96
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:24,958
Yes, we love TikTok, don't we?
We love TikTok.

97
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:27,748
We used to hate it,
but then it, quite frankly,

98
00:05:27,748 --> 00:05:30,968
in many ways, got me
elected, so now we love it.

99
00:05:30,968 --> 00:05:34,485
We also love the Rizzler, don't we,
folks?

100
00:05:34,485 --> 00:05:36,920
And they're trying to take the Rizzler
away from us.

101
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:39,240
It's so sad.
They want him the hell out of here.

102
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:42,590
We do love Costco, guys.
Boom!

103
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:45,831
And we're doing Get Ready With Me.
That's gonna be fun.

104
00:05:45,831 --> 00:05:48,468
And we're doing the Challengers.
Remember Ice Bucket?

105
00:05:48,468 --> 00:05:51,170
We loved Ice Bucket.
Anyway.

106
00:05:51,170 --> 00:05:55,691
We may have to go over to Reels with Mark
Zuckerberg.

107
00:05:55,691 --> 00:05:58,375
I like him now.
Zuck.
He looks better.

108
00:05:58,375 --> 00:06:02,931
Much cooler in terms of perm and with
regard to chain.

109
00:06:02,932 --> 00:06:08,085
And he will, of course, be at my
inauguration, which will be indoors.

110
00:06:08,085 --> 00:06:10,320
Too many people to fit outside.

111
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:13,360
You know, we're excited.

112
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:18,442
We're very excited to be inaugurated on
Martin Luther King Day.

113
00:06:18,442 --> 00:06:19,780
I like sharing the day.

114
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:23,466
And we're excited about my latest cabinet
pick.

115
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:26,210
It's someone I know you'll be very excited
to see.

116
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:28,188
George Santos.

117
00:06:28,188 --> 00:06:30,809
Hello, everyone.

118
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:34,254
Yes, it's me, George Santos,

119
00:06:34,254 --> 00:06:36,514
a.k.a. Quittara Ravache,

120
00:06:36,514 --> 00:06:39,170
a.k.a. Club Chalamet.

121
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:41,974
I'm so honored to be
joining Trump's cabinet

122
00:06:41,974 --> 00:06:44,791
as secretary of fact-checking

123
00:06:44,791 --> 00:06:48,640
and ambassador to Sephora.

124
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:53,223
I am part of the politician
to cameo, back to
politician,

125
00:06:53,223 --> 00:06:55,770
and
eventually to jail pipeline.

126
00:06:55,770 --> 00:06:59,800
But while I'm excited for Monday,
this has been a very hard month for me.

127
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:03,072
I am so sad about the passing of Jimmy
Carter.

128
00:07:03,072 --> 00:07:06,475
He had a great influence on me,
since he was...

129
00:07:06,475 --> 00:07:08,269
my dad.

130
00:07:08,269 --> 00:07:11,970
Now, excuse me, I'm late for a date with
my boyfriend,

131
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:14,452
Luigi Mangione!

132
00:07:15,007 --> 00:07:17,699
Well, we are almost out
of time,

133
00:07:17,699 --> 00:07:21,393
so let's just try
to end this before another
tweet comes through.

134
00:07:21,393 --> 00:07:23,334
Oh, too late.

135
00:07:23,334 --> 00:07:28,989
Uh, it appears that Trump is watching and
live-tweeting this program right now.

136
00:07:28,989 --> 00:07:34,386
He just said, I'm stuck watching MS,
DNC,

137
00:07:34,386 --> 00:07:35,971
awful anchors.

138
00:07:35,971 --> 00:07:40,189
This line-up looks like
Scooby-Doo: Oops, all Velma.

139
00:07:40,189 --> 00:07:42,996
All right, he still got it.
He still got it.

140
00:07:42,996 --> 00:07:47,226
and live from New York...
It's Saturday Night!

141
00:09:54,881 --> 00:09:58,866
MUSIC

142
00:09:59,012 --> 00:10:02,927
AND YOUR HOST, DAVE CHAPPELLE.

143
00:10:06,148 --> 00:10:10,757
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN -- DAVE
CHAPPELLE!

144
00:10:30,469 --> 00:10:33,005
>>> THANK YOU.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

145
00:10:33,005 --> 00:10:34,649
TURN THIS UP, I CAN'T HEAR.

146
00:10:34,649 --> 00:10:36,752
THANK YOU, GUYS.

147
00:10:37,006 --> 00:10:38,710
BOY.

148
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:40,447
I GOT TO TELL YOU GUYS
SOMETHING.

149
00:10:40,447 --> 00:10:42,414
I'M BEING VERY HONEST.

150
00:10:42,414 --> 00:10:46,127
I AM IN QUITE THE PICKLE
TONIGHT.

151
00:10:46,127 --> 00:10:50,683
AND IT STARTED -- IT STARTED IN
OCTOBER.

152
00:10:50,683 --> 00:10:52,415
LORNE MICHAELS CALLED ME.

153
00:10:52,415 --> 00:10:55,803
AND HE ASKED ME TO DO "SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE"

154
00:10:55,803 --> 00:10:58,043
THE FIRST EPISODE
AFTER THE ELECTION.

155
00:10:58,043 --> 00:11:00,925
AND I WAS LIKE, NAH, MAN, I'M
COOL.

156
00:11:08,687 --> 00:11:09,925
AND HE'S LIKE," WHY NOT?"

157
00:11:09,925 --> 00:11:11,604
"YOU KNOW, THINGS ARE GOING GOOD,

158
00:11:11,604 --> 00:11:14,192
I FINISHED MY NETFLIX
DEAL, I GOT ALL THIS MONEY AND
STUFF."

159
00:11:14,192 --> 00:11:15,751
OH, MAN, PLEASE?

160
00:11:15,751 --> 00:11:18,595
"YOU KNOW WHAT I'LL DO?"

161
00:11:18,595 --> 00:11:22,961
SAVE THE DATE CLOSEST TO JANUARY
6th."

162
00:11:27,109 --> 00:11:30,302
AND THEN THE DATE STARTED ROLLING AROUND

163
00:11:30,302 --> 00:11:32,854
AND IN DECEMBER
HE STARTED CALLING ME AGAIN.

164
00:11:32,854 --> 00:11:34,546
AND AGAIN I WAS LIKE, "I DON'T
WANT TO DO IT."

165
00:11:34,546 --> 00:11:37,407
AND THIS GOES ON FOR WEEKS AND
WEEKS.

166
00:11:37,407 --> 00:11:39,588
AND FINALLY, I GO, YOU KNOW
WHAT?

167
00:11:39,588 --> 00:11:42,497
I COULD JUST GET RID OF ALL
THESE OLD TRUMP JOKES

168
00:11:42,497 --> 00:11:46,907
AND START
FRESH.
I SAY, "YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'LL DO IT."

169
00:11:48,679 --> 00:11:50,413
THANK YOU.

170
00:11:50,413 --> 00:11:52,874
HERE WE ALL ARE.

171
00:11:54,364 --> 00:11:57,033
THE MOMENT I SAID YES,

172
00:11:57,033 --> 00:12:00,098
L.A. BURST INTO FLAMES.

173
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:06,082
AND IT'S A TOUGH ONE, YOU KNOW
WHAT I MEAN?

174
00:12:06,082 --> 00:12:07,862
BECAUSE I'M TIRED OF BEING
CONTROVERSIAL.

175
00:12:07,862 --> 00:12:09,386
I'M TRYING TO TURN OVER A NEW
LEAF.

176
00:12:09,386 --> 00:12:13,473
AND IT IS WAY TOO SOON.

177
00:12:13,473 --> 00:12:17,059
TO DO JOKES ABOUT A CATASTROPHE
LIKE THAT.

178
00:12:21,194 --> 00:12:23,132
IT IS.

179
00:12:23,132 --> 00:12:26,147
YOU KNOW, WHAT'S CRAZY ABOUT IT
IS THIS ONE HITS CLOSE TO HOME,

180
00:12:26,147 --> 00:12:29,228
AND I DON'T LIVE IN L.A.
I'VE NEVER BEEN A BIG FAN OF
L.A.

181
00:12:29,228 --> 00:12:31,715
BUT I'VE BUILT MANY, MANY
MEMORIES THERE,

182
00:12:31,715 --> 00:12:33,204
AND I HAVE GREAT
FRIENDS THERE.

183
00:12:33,204 --> 00:12:35,038
AND A LOT OF THEM LOST THEIR
HOMES.

184
00:12:35,038 --> 00:12:38,680
CARY ELWES, STARRED IN "MEN IN TIGHTS" WITH,

185
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:40,636
HOUSE BURNED TO
THE GROUND.

186
00:12:40,636 --> 00:12:44,048
MAD LIB, WHO WAS ON "SATURDAY
NIGHT LIVE" LAST TIME I WAS HERE,

187
00:12:44,048 --> 00:12:46,266
HOUSE BURNT TO THE GROUND.

188
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:47,802
SO MANY, I COULD GO ON AND ON.

189
00:12:47,802 --> 00:12:49,384
MY FIRST
DENNIS QUAID,

190
00:12:49,384 --> 00:12:52,622
I SAW HIM ON THE
NEWS WITH TEARS IN HIS EYES,

191
00:12:52,622 --> 00:12:54,331
AND IT BROKE MY HEART.

192
00:12:54,331 --> 00:12:58,900
THEN I GO ON THE INTERNET, AND I
WATCH THESE FIRE VIDEOS,

193
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:00,876
AND I
READ THE COMMENT SECTIONS AND
EVERYONE'S LIKE,

194
00:13:00,876 --> 00:13:03,394
YAH, IT SERVES
THESE CELEBRITIES RIGHT,

195
00:13:03,394 --> 00:13:05,530
I HOPE
THEIR HOUSES BURN DOWN!

196
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:09,320
YOU SEE THAT?
THAT RIGHT THERE?

197
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:12,742
THAT'S WHY I HATE POOR PEOPLE.

198
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:20,554
BECAUSE THEY CAN'T SEE PAST
THEIR OWN PAIN.

199
00:13:27,845 --> 00:13:30,507
OTHER DAY ON THE NEWS --

200
00:13:32,518 --> 00:13:35,933
THE OTHER DAY ON THE NEWS, THEY SAID
THESE FIRES WERE THE MOST

201
00:13:35,933 --> 00:13:39,191
EXPENSIVE TRAGEDY THAT EVER
HAPPENED.
NATURAL DISASTER.

202
00:13:39,191 --> 00:13:41,366
THEY SAID MOST EXPENSIVE NATURAL DISASTER

203
00:13:41,366 --> 00:13:43,995
THAT'S EVER HAPPENED IN
UNITED STATES HISTORY.

204
00:13:43,995 --> 00:13:46,463
AND YOU WANT TO KNOW WHY I THINK
THAT IS?

205
00:13:46,463 --> 00:13:49,820
BECAUSE PEOPLE IN L.A. HAVE NICE
STUFF.

206
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:52,553
I COULD BURN 40,000 ACRES IN
MISSISSIPPI

207
00:13:52,553 --> 00:13:55,081
FOR 6 OR $700.

208
00:14:05,276 --> 00:14:07,977
AND NOW, AND NOW --

209
00:14:08,781 --> 00:14:12,700
AND NOW WE WATCH THE NEWS OR TALK TO MY
FRIENDS,

210
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:16,172
THEY ALL HAVE THESE
CONSPIRACY THEORIES WHAT ARE
THESE FIRES?

211
00:14:16,172 --> 00:14:18,802
THEY SAY IT'S ARSONISTS.
I'VE HEARD THIS THEORY,

212
00:14:18,802 --> 00:14:20,945
AND I'M
SURE THERE WAS SOME ARSONISTS.

213
00:14:20,945 --> 00:14:23,349
BUT THERE WERE A LOT OF ELEMENTS
THAT CAME TOGETHER

214
00:14:23,349 --> 00:14:25,382
TO MAKE THIS
FIRE THE CATASTROPHE THAT IT
WAS.

215
00:14:25,382 --> 00:14:27,362
THE WINDS WERE 100 MILES AN
HOUR.

216
00:14:27,362 --> 00:14:30,495
L.A. WAS DRY AS A BONE AND THE LEVIES

217
00:14:30,495 --> 00:14:32,196
AND IT WAS TOO MANY
FACTORS.

218
00:14:32,196 --> 00:14:34,915
IF YOU WERE A RATIONAL THINKING PERSON,

219
00:14:34,915 --> 00:14:38,118
YOU HAVE TO AT LEAST
CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY

220
00:14:38,118 --> 00:14:40,976
THAT
GOD HATES THESE PEOPLE.

221
00:14:44,762 --> 00:14:47,415
SODOMITES!

222
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:55,301
AND THAT'S NOT TRUE, BECAUSE --
BECAUSE WEST HOLLYWOOD WAS
UNSCATHED.

223
00:14:55,778 --> 00:15:00,721
BECAUSE, HOW CAN YOU BURN WHAT
IS ALREADY FLAMING?

224
00:15:09,058 --> 00:15:11,999
A LOT OF POOR PEOPLE WERE
AFFECTED, TOO.

225
00:15:11,999 --> 00:15:15,160
A LOT OF JUST REGULAR
WORKING-CLASS FAMILIES WERE
AFFECTED, TOO.

226
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:18,796
A LOT OF THOSE FAMILIES FOUND
OUT THE WEEK OF THE FIRES

227
00:15:18,796 --> 00:15:22,008
THAT THEY LOST THEIR HEALTH -- NOT
THEIR HEALTH, THEIR FIRE
INSURANCE.

228
00:15:22,008 --> 00:15:25,661
BUT EITHER WAY, LUIGI IS LIKE,
YOU'RE WELCOME.

229
00:15:27,642 --> 00:15:30,387
YOU KNOW LUIGI, KILLED THEM.

230
00:15:30,849 --> 00:15:35,016
AND THAT KID DID ALMOST PLAN
LIKE THE PERFECT CRIME.

231
00:15:35,016 --> 00:15:37,567
HE DID EVERYTHING RIGHT, PLANNED
EVERYTHING PERFECTLY.

232
00:15:37,567 --> 00:15:41,175
ONLY THING HE FORGOT WAS TO
SHAVE HIS EYEBROWS.

233
00:15:41,175 --> 00:15:44,796
SO THAT'S HIM.

234
00:15:47,591 --> 00:15:49,860
FINALLY, THEY GET IN THE FRONT
OF IT.

235
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:53,051
THIS WEEK, THANK GOD, THESE
FIRES, SUBSIDING.

236
00:15:53,051 --> 00:15:56,578
AND NOT WITHOUT HELP.
A LOT OF COUNTRIES PITCHED IN.

237
00:15:56,578 --> 00:15:59,450
CANADA SENT PLANES THAT HELPED
US OUT.

238
00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:01,727
MEXICO SENT FIREFIGHTERS.

239
00:16:01,727 --> 00:16:05,457
AND TRUMP WAS LIKE, "MAKE SURE
THEY LEAVE WHEN THEY'RE
FINISHED."

240
00:16:11,455 --> 00:16:14,027
TRUMP'S A WILD GUY.

241
00:16:15,456 --> 00:16:16,856
HE'S A WILD GUY.

242
00:16:16,856 --> 00:16:19,934
I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING HE DID
THAT MADE ME CRAZY WHEN HE WAS
RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT.

243
00:16:19,934 --> 00:16:22,788
WHEN HE WAS RUNNING FOR
PRESIDENT, HE SAID THIS AT A
DEBATE.

244
00:16:22,788 --> 00:16:27,551
HE SAID THE HAITIANS IN
SPRINGFIELD, OHIO,

245
00:16:27,833 --> 00:16:31,322
WERE EATING
PEOPLE'S DOGS AND CATS.

246
00:16:31,322 --> 00:16:34,787
THAT REALLY UPSET ME, BECAUSE I
LIVE IN OHIO. IN FACT, I LIVE --

247
00:16:34,787 --> 00:16:36,831
WHAT'S UP,
OHIO?

248
00:16:37,468 --> 00:16:41,361
I LIVE ONE TOWN OVER FROM
SPRINGFIELD.

249
00:16:41,361 --> 00:16:43,815
THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE FROM OHIO,
I HOPE YOU KNOW,

250
00:16:43,815 --> 00:16:46,786
THAT'S NOT
WHAT'S HAPPENING IN SPRINGFIELD
AT ALL.

251
00:16:46,786 --> 00:16:49,365
WHAT HAPPENED IN SPRINGFIELD IS
A LOT OF JOBS WENT AWAY.

252
00:16:49,365 --> 00:16:53,803
20,000 HAITIAN IMMIGRANTS WERE
MOVED THERE BY OUR GOVERNMENT, LEGALLY,

253
00:16:53,803 --> 00:16:56,185
AND THEY PAID MARKET VALUE FOR THEIR RENTS,

254
00:16:56,185 --> 00:17:00,037
AND THEY
SAVED A LOT OF COMPANIES BECAUSE
THEY DID JOBS THE WHITES WEREN'T
DOING.

255
00:17:00,037 --> 00:17:04,499
IT'S NOT THAT THE WHITES
COULDN'T DO THESE JOBS, BUT THEY
WERE BUSY DOING OTHER THINGS.

256
00:17:04,499 --> 00:17:07,630
HEROIN, SLEEPING ON THE STREETS,
YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS.

257
00:17:14,393 --> 00:17:18,259
AND THOSE COMMUNITIES ARE
IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES WHO TEND
TO BE VERY SUCCESSFUL.

258
00:17:18,259 --> 00:17:20,506
THEY DON'T COME TO AMERICA TO
NOT BE RICH.

259
00:17:20,506 --> 00:17:23,149
WHEN HE SAID THAT, THAT
COMMUNITY CAUGHT HELL.

260
00:17:23,149 --> 00:17:25,356
THERE WAS LIKE A JEALOUSY THAT
RAN THROUGH THE COMMUNITY.

261
00:17:25,356 --> 00:17:26,759
THERE WAS NOTHING I COULD DO
ABOUT IT.

262
00:17:26,759 --> 00:17:30,019
BUT BECAUSE I WAS FAMOUS I SAID,
LET ME JUST BE SUPPORTIVE.

263
00:17:30,019 --> 00:17:35,668
SO EVERY DAY FOR LIKE TEN DAYS I
WOULD DRIVE A FEW MILES OVER TO SPRINGFIELD

264
00:17:35,668 --> 00:17:37,680
AND EAT LUNCH AT THE
HAITIAN RESTAURANT.

265
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:42,496
I LET THEM KNOW, IF I'M SAFE
HERE, YOU GUYS ARE DEFINITELY
SAFE HERE.

266
00:17:42,496 --> 00:17:45,033
AND TO BE HONEST WITH YOU,

267
00:17:45,831 --> 00:17:48,721
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEAT WAS.

268
00:17:53,454 --> 00:17:58,830
BUT WHATEVER IT WAS, IT FELL
RIGHT OFF THE BONE, I'LL TELL
YOU THAT.

269
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:06,796
NOW I'M EVEN GETTING NERVOUS AT
OHIO.

270
00:18:06,796 --> 00:18:09,090
I MIGHT LEAVE WITH THE HAITIANS.

271
00:18:09,471 --> 00:18:10,889
NO, I'M SERIOUS, MAN.

272
00:18:10,889 --> 00:18:14,493
YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS, MAN?
IT'S JUST NO FUN BEING FAMOUS
ANYMORE.

273
00:18:14,493 --> 00:18:16,551
IT'S LIKE, OH, Y'ALL MADE IT
SCARY.

274
00:18:16,551 --> 00:18:17,995
YOU KNOW WHAT IT FEELS LIKE,
BEING FAMOUS?

275
00:18:17,995 --> 00:18:19,530
SCARY IS THE RIGHT WORD.

276
00:18:19,530 --> 00:18:23,120
IT FEELS LIKE, AND I'M NOT BEING
DRAMATIC.

277
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:27,307
IT FEELS LIKE I'M STORMING THE
BEACH AT NORMANDY, WORLD WAR II.

278
00:18:27,307 --> 00:18:30,311
BUT I GOT TO KEEP A HAPPY
EXPRESSION ON MY FACE ALL THE
TIME.

279
00:18:30,311 --> 00:18:34,799
IMAGINE ALL THE DANGERS STORMING
THE BEACH BUT I STILL --

280
00:18:35,727 --> 00:18:40,136
BOATS ARE WHIZZING BY, STUFF IS
EXPLODING, I'M JUST LIKE --

281
00:18:40,136 --> 00:18:42,703
EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE, SOMETHING
TERRIBLE HAPPENS.

282
00:18:42,703 --> 00:18:47,114
POW!
OH, NO!
POPPY GOT HIT!

283
00:18:50,298 --> 00:18:55,423
AND POPPY BE LIKE, UH -- KEEP
GOING, PLAYBOY.

284
00:18:56,191 --> 00:18:59,916
FACE

285
00:19:06,702 --> 00:19:09,552
I'VE BEEN IN TROUBLE IN MY DAY.

286
00:19:09,552 --> 00:19:11,399
I'VE BEEN IN A LOT OF TROUBLE IN
MY DAY.

287
00:19:11,399 --> 00:19:13,302
MAN, LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING,
THIS GUY PUFFY,

288
00:19:13,302 --> 00:19:17,705
THIS GUY'S IN AN
ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF TROUBLE.

289
00:19:18,356 --> 00:19:21,575
I DON'T THINK I'VE SEEN ANYTHING
LIKE THIS.

290
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:24,945
THEY GOT THIS GUY IN A RICO CASE

291
00:19:24,945 --> 00:19:27,348
BY HIMSELF.

292
00:19:36,037 --> 00:19:38,423
A LOT OF MY FRIENDS ASK ME,

293
00:19:38,423 --> 00:19:42,799
THEY SAY, DAVE, DID YOU KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT THOSE FREAKOFF PARTIES?

294
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:46,587
I BE LIKE, NO, MAN.

295
00:19:47,135 --> 00:19:49,540
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT
FREAKOFFS.

296
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:52,131
THEY ALL LOOK AT ME LIKE --

297
00:19:54,761 --> 00:19:57,562
THEY BE LIKE, HOW ARE ALL THESE
PEOPLE YOU KNOW WAS AT THE FREAKOFF,

298
00:19:57,562 --> 00:19:59,998
YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE
THAT WASN'T AT THE FREAKOFF?

299
00:19:59,998 --> 00:20:05,199
I THOUGHT ABOUT IT FOR A MINUTE.
I SAID, OH, MY GOD.

300
00:20:06,384 --> 00:20:08,730
I'M UGLY.

301
00:20:11,476 --> 00:20:13,657
BOY.

302
00:20:13,957 --> 00:20:17,957
THAT IS A TOUGH WAY TO FIND THAT
OUT.

303
00:20:18,463 --> 00:20:21,286
CAN YOU IMAGINE, YOU AND ME
READING THE NEWSPAPER

304
00:20:21,286 --> 00:20:25,882
AND FOUND
OUT EVERYONE IN HOLLYWOOD HAD AN
ORGY BEHIND YOUR BACK?

305
00:20:25,882 --> 00:20:28,824
LIKE, NONE OF Y'ALL CALLED ME?

306
00:20:29,512 --> 00:20:31,915
BOY, THAT REALLY HURTS.

307
00:20:31,915 --> 00:20:33,616
I'M GLAD THEY DIDN'T CALL ME,
THOUGH.

308
00:20:33,616 --> 00:20:35,864
BECAUSE THE STORIES COMING OUT
ABOUT IT ARE CRAZY.

309
00:20:35,864 --> 00:20:37,689
I SAW ONE THING ON THE INTERNET.

310
00:20:37,689 --> 00:20:39,483
SO I'M NOT SURE THIS IS TRUE.

311
00:20:39,483 --> 00:20:41,938
PROBABLY DOUBT IT'S TRUE.
BUT I SAW IT.

312
00:20:41,938 --> 00:20:45,977
SOME GUY WHO SAID HE DO PUFFY
LIKE, YEAH, MAN, HE WAS LIKE, I
WAS AT THE FREAKOFF,

313
00:20:45,977 --> 00:20:51,607
I WENT IN
THE BACK ROOM, PUFF WAS IN THERE
WITH THE GUY FROM "FAMILY MATTERS,"

314
00:20:51,607 --> 00:20:54,778
HE WAS SMASHING.
I WAS LIKE, PUFF, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING?

315
00:20:54,778 --> 00:20:59,187
HE WAS LIKE, YEAH, FEELS GOOD TO
MAKE ANOTHER MAN DO YOUR
BIDDING.

316
00:20:59,187 --> 00:21:01,999
AND I WAS LIKE, OH, MY GOD.

317
00:21:02,682 --> 00:21:06,216
KARL WINSLOW FROM "FAMILY
MATTERS" WAS THERE,

318
00:21:06,216 --> 00:21:08,916
AND I WASN'T
INVITED?

319
00:21:15,794 --> 00:21:18,646
WORSE THAN I THOUGHT.

320
00:21:19,885 --> 00:21:22,994
OR -- OR MAYBE I'M NOT UGLY.

321
00:21:22,994 --> 00:21:25,491
YOU KNOW.
LOOK.
LOOK AT MY FACE.

322
00:21:25,491 --> 00:21:28,021
THIS IS NOT NECESSARILY A
HANDSOME FACE.

323
00:21:28,021 --> 00:21:30,173
BUT IT'S NOT AN UGLY FACE.

324
00:21:30,173 --> 00:21:34,780
BUT IF YOU REALLY STUDY MY FACE
CLEARLY, CLEARLY

325
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:38,101
I HAVE SNITCH
ENERGY.

326
00:21:41,233 --> 00:21:43,651
OH, I LOOK LIKE I'LL TELL.

327
00:21:43,651 --> 00:21:48,159
THE LAST THING YOU WANT TO SEE
AT AN ORGY IS ME ACROSS THE ROOM
LOOKING AT YOU LIKE --

328
00:22:00,252 --> 00:22:03,835
LEAVE KARL WINSLOW ALONE!

329
00:22:10,292 --> 00:22:12,825
AMEN, AMEN.

330
00:22:12,825 --> 00:22:15,337
SO YOU WATCHING AT HOME, YOU
MIGHT NOT BE FAMOUS,

331
00:22:15,337 --> 00:22:17,939
BUT I BET
YOU AIN'T PERFECT.
NOBODY IS PERFECT.

332
00:22:17,939 --> 00:22:20,097
THE IDEA IS THAT YOU LIVE YOUR LIFE

333
00:22:20,097 --> 00:22:23,505
AND GROW PAST YOUR
MISTAKES.

334
00:22:23,505 --> 00:22:26,159
BUT IF YOU GET TO BE 55 --

335
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:28,661
AND PUFFY IS 55.

336
00:22:28,661 --> 00:22:33,422
HE DOESN'T LOOK OLD, BUT HE'S
PAYING HALF PRICE AT THE MOVIES.

337
00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:39,464
I SEE YOU, PLAYBOY.

338
00:22:40,662 --> 00:22:44,119
AIN'T NOTHING WRONG GETTING
OLDER, BUT IF YOU 55

339
00:22:44,119 --> 00:22:48,990
AND YOU GOT
A THOUSAND BOTTLES OF BABY OIL
IN THE HOUSE,

340
00:22:48,990 --> 00:22:53,450
CLEARLY YOU CAN'T
STOP, DON'T STOP.

341
00:22:53,450 --> 00:22:56,090
YOU COMMITTED TO THE LIFESTYLE.

342
00:22:56,090 --> 00:22:59,230
BECAUSE I'M 51.
AND I'M TELLING YOU, THIS IS
TRUE.

343
00:22:59,230 --> 00:23:01,698
I CAN'T REMEMBER A SINGLE TIME

344
00:23:01,698 --> 00:23:05,355
I EVER THREW AN EMPTY BOTTLE OF
BABY OIL IN THE TRASH.

345
00:23:07,857 --> 00:23:12,009
I DON'T THINK I'VE EVER FINISHED
A BOTTLE OF BABY OIL IN MY LIFE.

346
00:23:12,009 --> 00:23:16,697
IF WE WENT TO MY MOTHER'S HOUSE
TONIGHT, SHE'D PROBABLY HAVE THE
SAME BABY OIL WE HAD

347
00:23:16,697 --> 00:23:18,557
WHEN I WAS
A LITTLE BOY WITH A TANK TOP,

348
00:23:18,557 --> 00:23:21,616
AND SOMEHOW PUFFY WAS ALL THE
WAY DOWN TO THE LAST.

349
00:23:26,243 --> 00:23:29,376
AND HAVING BABY OIL IS NOT
ILLEGAL.

350
00:23:29,376 --> 00:23:31,463
THEY DON'T REMIND YOU ABOUT THAT
PART.

351
00:23:31,463 --> 00:23:33,946
THAT'S THE LEAST HARMFUL THING I
READ.

352
00:23:33,946 --> 00:23:35,883
HE WAS THE WRONG LUBE, I THINK.

353
00:23:35,883 --> 00:23:38,871
IF HE USED CRISCO, HE WOULD HAVE
GOT AWAY FROM IT.

354
00:23:38,871 --> 00:23:42,287
THEY JUST KNOW HE LIKES TO COOK.

355
00:23:49,218 --> 00:23:51,250
THANKS.

356
00:24:02,638 --> 00:24:05,648
THANK GOD THEY CAUGHT HIM BEFORE
THOSE FIRES.

357
00:24:05,648 --> 00:24:08,513
GODDAMN MUSHROOM CLOUD OVER HIS
HOUSE.

358
00:24:08,513 --> 00:24:11,852
A THOUSAND BOTTLES OF BABY OIL
IN THERE.

359
00:24:19,183 --> 00:24:21,300
HERE'S THE THING.

360
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:25,334
ON MONDAY, DONALD TRUMP'S COMING
BACK.

361
00:24:25,334 --> 00:24:29,195
HE'LL BE THE 47th PRESIDENT.
HE'S DONE IT AGAIN.

362
00:24:29,195 --> 00:24:33,496
AND ALL THE FLAGS WILL BE AT
HALF STAFF BECAUSE JIMMY CARTER
DIED.

363
00:24:33,496 --> 00:24:36,625
JIMMY CARTER, GO BACK AND FORTH

364
00:24:36,625 --> 00:24:38,760
AND SAY HE WAS A BAD PRESIDENT
OR A GOOD PRESIDENT.

365
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:43,524
I'M NOT QUALIFIED TO SPEAK ON
THAT.
BUT I'LL TELL YOU THIS.

366
00:24:43,524 --> 00:24:46,938
I WAS IN THE MIDDLE EAST YEARS
AGO AFTER I QUIT MY SHOW.

367
00:24:46,938 --> 00:24:49,286
I WAS TRYING TO FIND OUT WHAT I
WANTED TO DO WITH MY LIFE.

368
00:24:49,286 --> 00:24:53,735
WHILE I WAS THERE, JIMMY CARTER
FLEW TO ISRAEL.

369
00:24:53,735 --> 00:24:57,438
SO EVERYBODY IN THE REGION WAS
TALKING ABOUT A FORMER AMERICAN
PRESIDENT.

370
00:24:57,438 --> 00:24:59,847
BEING IN THE MIDDLE EAST.

371
00:24:59,847 --> 00:25:03,838
AND WHILE HE WAS IN ISRAEL, A
BOOK OF HIS WAS RELEASED,

372
00:25:03,838 --> 00:25:07,083
AND
ITS TITLE WAS VERY CONTROVERSIAL
IN ISRAEL.

373
00:25:07,083 --> 00:25:12,543
AND THE TITLE OF THE BOOK WAS
"PALESTINE: PEACE, NOT"
APARTHEID."

374
00:25:12,543 --> 00:25:14,596
PEOPLE WERE VERY MAD IN ISRAEL.

375
00:25:14,596 --> 00:25:17,963
THERE WAS A LOT OF MEAN STORIES
THAT CAME OUT IN THE PAPER.
SOME PEOPLE WERE SUPPORTIVE.

376
00:25:17,963 --> 00:25:20,686
WHILE HE WAS THERE,

377
00:25:20,686 --> 00:25:24,212
JIMMY CARTER
SAID, I WANT TO GO TO THE
PALESTINIAN TERRITORY,

378
00:25:24,212 --> 00:25:26,710
AND THE
ISRAELI GOVERNMENT SAID, IT'S
TOO DANGEROUS,

379
00:25:26,710 --> 00:25:31,131
AND IF YOU GO, WE
CANNOT PROTECT YOU.

380
00:25:31,131 --> 00:25:34,286
AND THEN JIMMY CARTER WENT
ANYWAY.

381
00:25:34,286 --> 00:25:37,872
I WILL NEVER FORGET THE IMAGES
OF A FORMER AMERICAN PRESIDENT

382
00:25:37,872 --> 00:25:39,868
WALKING WITH LITTLE TO NO SECURITY

383
00:25:39,868 --> 00:25:42,173
WHILE THOUSANDS OF
PALESTINIANS WERE CHEERING HIM
ON.

384
00:25:42,173 --> 00:25:45,737
WHEN I SAW THAT PICTURE, IT
BROUGHT TEARS TO MY EYES.

385
00:25:45,737 --> 00:25:48,467
I SAID, I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S A
GOOD PRESIDENT,

386
00:25:48,467 --> 00:25:51,857
BUT THAT RIGHT
THERE, I AM SURE,

387
00:25:51,857 --> 00:25:53,556
IS A GREAT
MAN.

388
00:25:53,556 --> 00:25:57,754
IT MADE ME FEEL VERY PROUD.

389
00:26:04,987 --> 00:26:09,388
THE PRESIDENCY IS NO PLACE FOR
PETTY PEOPLE.

390
00:26:09,388 --> 00:26:14,095
SO DONALD TRUMP, I KNOW YOU
WATCH THE SHOW.

391
00:26:16,732 --> 00:26:20,387
MAN, REMEMBER, WHETHER PEOPLE
VOTED FOR YOU OR NOT,

392
00:26:20,387 --> 00:26:22,469
THEY'RE
ALL COUNTING ON YOU.

393
00:26:22,469 --> 00:26:27,390
WHETHER THEY LIKE YOU OR NOT,
THEY'RE ALL COUNTING ON YOU.

394
00:26:27,390 --> 00:26:29,437
THE WHOLE WORLD IS COUNTING ON
YOU.

395
00:26:29,437 --> 00:26:32,121
I MEAN THIS WHEN I SAY THIS.
GOOD LUCK.

396
00:26:32,121 --> 00:26:34,740
PLEASE, DO BETTER NEXT TIME.

397
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:38,587
PLEASE, ALL OF US, DO BETTER
NEXT TIME.

398
00:26:38,587 --> 00:26:40,774
DO NOT FORGET YOUR HUMANITY,

399
00:26:40,774 --> 00:26:43,866
AND PLEASE HAVE EMPATHY FOR
DISPLACED PEOPLE,

400
00:26:43,866 --> 00:26:47,560
WHETHER
THEY'RE IN THE PALISADES OR
PALESTINE.

401
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:50,904
THANK YOU VERY MUCH, AND GOOD
NIGHT.

402
00:27:14,921 --> 00:27:17,236
SHOW"

403
00:27:17,236 --> 00:27:22,107
WITH YOUR HOST JOAQUIN
ANTONIO GONZALES HERNANDES
SUAREZ.

404
00:27:22,414 --> 00:27:25,720
>> HELLO AND WELCOME TO
IMMIGRANT DAD TALK SHOW.

405
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:28,432
THIS IS THE SHOW WHERE WE TALK
ABOUT OUR CHILDREN,

406
00:27:28,432 --> 00:27:32,352
THE ONES WE
LOVE AND THE SONS AS WELL

407
00:27:32,352 --> 00:27:34,907
TODAY I AM JOINED BY MY SPECIAL
GUEST,

408
00:27:34,907 --> 00:27:37,701
MY BLACK NEIGHBOR,
RICHARD.

409
00:27:37,701 --> 00:27:40,176
>> YOU KNOW, YOU DON'T HAVE TO
SAY BLACK MAN.

410
00:27:40,176 --> 00:27:45,068
>> SORRY, MY AFRICAN AMERICAN
NEIGHBOR RICHARD.

411
00:27:45,068 --> 00:27:47,989
>> JUST SAY BLACK.
>> OKAY.

412
00:27:48,137 --> 00:27:52,239
HEY, BLACK RICHARD --

413
00:27:53,188 --> 00:27:55,606
HOW MANY SONS DO YOU HAVE?

414
00:27:55,606 --> 00:27:57,632
>> WELL, I GOT THREE THAT GREW
UP IN MY HOUSE

415
00:27:57,632 --> 00:28:00,738
AND ONE WHO'S --
I ONLY KNOW BY VOICE.

416
00:28:00,738 --> 00:28:05,336
>> OKAY, HA HA HA.
THAT GIVE ME MORE QUESTIONS THAN
ANSWERS.

417
00:28:05,336 --> 00:28:07,404
BUT LET'S START WITH OUR FIRST
SEGMENT.

418
00:28:07,404 --> 00:28:10,831
"THINGS OUR SONS LIKE THAT THEY"
SHOULDN'T LIKE."

419
00:28:10,831 --> 00:28:13,397
MY SON LOVE TIKTOK.

420
00:28:13,397 --> 00:28:16,971
I TELL HIM, LET ME TIKTOK TO YOU
ABOUT SOMETHING.

421
00:28:16,971 --> 00:28:18,968
GET A JOB, MAN.

422
00:28:18,968 --> 00:28:23,401
YOU ARE BROKE, AND YOU ARE UGLY.
YOU CANNOT BE BOTH.

423
00:28:24,086 --> 00:28:27,513
RICHARD, WHAT YOUR SON LIKE THAT
HE SHOULDN'T LIKE?

424
00:28:27,513 --> 00:28:29,651
>> WHITE PEOPLE.

425
00:28:30,166 --> 00:28:32,967
HE JUST LOVES THEM.

426
00:28:32,967 --> 00:28:35,148
I TELL YOU, YOU NEED BLACK
FRIENDS, HE SAYS,

427
00:28:35,148 --> 00:28:39,443
NO, I NEED
SOME DRIED CHICKEN AND SOME
IMPROV.

428
00:28:39,443 --> 00:28:44,560
>> OH, MY GOD, MY SON LOVE TO GO
TO BROOKLYN TO IMPROV WITH THE
WHITE PEOPLE.

429
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:48,396
REMIND ME.

I SAY, VEGAN TALK ABOUT THIS
AFTER YOU EAT THE CHICKEN.

432
00:28:55,810 --> 00:28:58,936
>> MY SON SAID HE DIAGNOSED
HIMSELF WITH OCD.

433
00:28:58,936 --> 00:29:02,647
I SAID, OH?
CD'S NUTS!

434
00:29:04,286 --> 00:29:06,328
BIG BALLS

435
00:29:06,661 --> 00:29:09,551
>> OH, OKAY, MAN.
HEY, IT'S TIME TO BRING OUT MY
NEXT GUEST.

436
00:29:09,551 --> 00:29:11,783
HE'S A FATHER WHO LIVING IN THE
NEIGHBORHOOD.

437
00:29:11,783 --> 00:29:15,032
PLEASE WELCOME BACK TO THE SHOW

438
00:29:16,554 --> 00:29:20,048

00:29:20,048 --> 00:29:22,293

00:29:22,293 --> 00:29:26,922

441
00:29:31,405 --> 00:29:34,731
>> WHITE GUY ALWAYS KNOW WHAT
NOT TO SAY, HA HA HA.

442
00:29:34,929 --> 00:29:37,842
KEVIN, TELL US.
WHAT DO YOU DO FOR WORK?

443
00:29:37,842 --> 00:29:42,762
>> WELL, I AM A GUIDANCE
COUNSELOR AT A SCHOOL FOR
CHILDREN WITH LEARNING
DISABILITIES.

444
00:29:42,762 --> 00:29:46,488
>> OH.
THAT'S FUNNY, BECAUSE MY SON
HAVE A DISABILITY.

445
00:29:46,488 --> 00:29:49,672
DISABILITY TO PISSING MY OFF.

446
00:29:54,099 --> 00:29:57,496
NOW IT'S TIME FOR OUR NEXT
SEGMENT, "WHAT WOULD YOU DO?"

447
00:29:57,496 --> 00:30:00,943
I TELL YOU SOMETHING, YOU TELL
ME, WHAT WOULD YOU DO?

448
00:30:00,943 --> 00:30:05,044
FIRST, YOUR SON GET MAD AND SLAM
THE DOOR.

449
00:30:05,044 --> 00:30:07,442
WHAT WOULD YOU DO, KEVIN?

450
00:30:07,442 --> 00:30:12,934
>> I LIKE TO APPROACH ANY ISSUE
WITH WHAT I CALL THE THREE Cs.

451
00:30:13,105 --> 00:30:16,117
COMMUNICATION, COMPASSION, AND
CARE.

452
00:30:16,117 --> 00:30:20,906
>> OH, WE FORGOT THE FOURTH "C."
A-PU-CIE.

453
00:30:27,645 --> 00:30:31,821
>> HE SAY YOU HAVE VAGINA, OKAY.

454
00:30:31,821 --> 00:30:34,129
HEY, RICHARD, SAME QUESTION FOR
YOU.

455
00:30:34,129 --> 00:30:36,995
WHAT WOULD YOU DO IF YOUR SON
SLAMMING THE DOOR?

456
00:30:36,995 --> 00:30:38,859
>> WELL, I WOULD BE AMAZED.

457
00:30:38,859 --> 00:30:41,662
BECAUSE MY SON DON'T HAVE A
DOOR.

458
00:30:41,662 --> 00:30:45,676
I TOOK IT OFF THE HINGES BECAUSE
HE GOT ADDICTED TO PORNOGRAPHY.

459
00:30:45,676 --> 00:30:51,378
A BLACK LIGHT IN HIS ROOM, IT
WOULD LOOK LIKE A CRIME SCENE
FROM A "CSI" EPISODE.

460
00:30:51,378 --> 00:30:55,015
CSI.
I LIKE "LAW AND ORDER."
YOU KNOW "LAW ANDARD"?

461
00:30:55,015 --> 00:30:56,922
TA-DUM!

462
00:30:58,776 --> 00:31:01,599
YOU KNOW WHAT I DO IF MY SON
SLAMMING THE DOOR?

463
00:31:01,599 --> 00:31:04,768
I SHOOT HIM WITH A GUN.

464
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:07,602
HE NEED TO SHOW RESPECT

465
00:31:07,602 --> 00:31:11,425
BECAUSE
MY BALLS USED TO BE HIS HOUSE.

466
00:31:18,365 --> 00:31:22,729
>> WELL -- I'LL HAVE YOU KNOW MY
SON DOES RESPECT ME,

467
00:31:22,729 --> 00:31:24,220
BECAUSE I
RESPECT HIM.

468
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:27,667
ISN'T THAT RIGHT, CONNER?
COME ON OUT HERE, BUDDY, COME
ON.

469
00:31:28,725 --> 00:31:30,402
>> HEY, DAD.
>> HEY.

470
00:31:30,402 --> 00:31:32,450
>> I'M SO LUCKY TO BE YOUR SON.

471
00:31:32,450 --> 00:31:36,904
>> HEY, YOU'RE NOT JUST MY SON.
YOU'RE MY BEST FRIEND.

472
00:31:36,904 --> 00:31:39,380
NOW, LET'S DO OUR SECRET
HANDSHAKE.

473
00:31:49,622 --> 00:31:53,058
>> YOU KISSING YOUR SON LIKE TOM
BRADY!

474
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:57,568
>> OH, OH, KEVIN, KEVIN.
PLEASE TELL US,

475
00:31:57,568 --> 00:32:01,154
WHAT DOES YOUR
WIFE THINK ABOUT YOU HAVING SEX
WITH YOUR SON?

476
00:32:01,154 --> 00:32:04,409
>> I DON'T HAVE SEX WITH MY SON.

477
00:32:04,786 --> 00:32:08,733
>> AND MY WIFE LOVES THAT WE
HAVE A CLOSE RELATIONSHIP.

478
00:32:08,733 --> 00:32:12,303
SHE'S ACTUALLY HERE AS WELL.
SWEETHEART?
COME ON OUT.

479
00:32:12,303 --> 00:32:14,384
>> HI, SWEETIE.

480
00:32:17,032 --> 00:32:19,588
>> HOLD UP.
HOLD UP.

481
00:32:19,588 --> 00:32:21,242
YOU GOT THIS ASS-BACKWARDS, MAN.

482
00:32:21,242 --> 00:32:25,010
HOW ARE YOU GOING TO KISS YOUR
SON AND JUST DAP UP YOUR WIFE?

483
00:32:25,010 --> 00:32:28,331
>> WE DON'T HAVE TO TAKE THIS,
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.

484
00:32:28,331 --> 00:32:30,587
>> COME ON, SON.

485
00:32:36,702 --> 00:32:39,978
>> SPEAKING OF WHICH, ONE OF MY
SONS IS HERE ALSO.

486
00:32:39,978 --> 00:32:42,078
COME ON OUT, SON.

487
00:32:42,078 --> 00:32:46,093
>> HOW YOU DOING, GOOD TO MEET
YOU.
>> NICE TO MEET YOU TOO, TAKE
CARE.

488
00:32:54,388 --> 00:32:56,515
>> THAT WAS VERY NICE.
>> YEAH.

489
00:32:56,515 --> 00:33:00,418
>> OKAY, WELL, THAT'S ALL THE
TIME WE ARE HAVING TODAY FOR
IMMIGRANT DAD SHOW.

490
00:33:00,558 --> 00:33:03,884
TUNE IN NEXT WEEK WHEN MY SON
ASK ME TO MAKE AN IMPOSSIBLE BURGER

491
00:33:03,884 --> 00:33:06,855
AND I SAY, BUT HOW?

492
00:33:36,550 --> 00:33:41,845
LA
ALERT AS THE WILDFIRES CONTINUE
TO THREATEN.

493
00:33:42,174 --> 00:33:45,848
>> OKAY, THAT'S IT.
THE CITY IS SAYING WE NEED TO
EVACUATE.

494
00:33:45,848 --> 00:33:49,013
>> OH, MY GOD, NOW?
>> YES, KEVIN.
WE KNEW THIS DAY MIGHT COME.

495
00:33:49,013 --> 00:33:50,788
OUR STUFF IS PACKED AND IN THE
GARAGE.

496
00:33:50,788 --> 00:33:53,749
REGGIE, YOU READY?
>> NO, HOLD ON, HOLD ON.

497
00:33:53,749 --> 00:33:56,866
>> BUT IT'S -- IT'S GOING TO BE
FINE, WE'LL GET THROUGH THIS.

498
00:33:56,866 --> 00:33:59,186
I PUT ALL OUR FAMILY PHOTOS IN
THE GO BAG.

499
00:33:59,186 --> 00:34:01,991
>> I GOT TO GET SOMETHING FIRST.

500
00:34:06,728 --> 00:34:09,819
>> REGGIE, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

501
00:34:09,819 --> 00:34:12,049
>> I GOT TO GET THIS CASH.

502
00:34:12,049 --> 00:34:13,862
>> WHERE DID YOU GET THAT MONEY?

503
00:34:13,862 --> 00:34:17,481
>> DON'T WORRY ABOUT WHERE I GOT
MY MONEY, AIN'T NO TIME TO
EXPLAIN, JUST GO.

504
00:34:17,481 --> 00:34:20,415
COME ON, BOY, COME AND HELP ME
GET THIS MONEY.

505
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:23,304
>> OH, GEEZ, DAD, HOW MUCH IS IN
HERE?

506
00:34:23,304 --> 00:34:27,171
>> I DON'T KNOW, 500 GRAND OR
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
ENOUGH FOR A WHILE.

507
00:34:27,171 --> 00:34:29,181
>> A WHILE?
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

508
00:34:29,181 --> 00:34:33,266
IS THIS A PASSPORT?
AND REGGIE, WHO IS DEMETRIUS
QUINN?

509
00:34:33,266 --> 00:34:38,166
>> SOMEBODY -- SOMEBODY WHO'S
ALWAYS WELCOME IN THE DOMINICAN
REPUBLIC, THAT'S WHO.

510
00:34:38,166 --> 00:34:42,214
>> WHY DO YOU HAVE THIS?
>> BABY, THERE IS NO TIME TO
EXPLAIN.

511
00:34:42,214 --> 00:34:46,467
THE HOUSE GOING TO BURN DOWN AND
Y'ALL WORRIED ABOUT WHO IS
DEMETRIUS QUINN?

512
00:34:46,467 --> 00:34:48,170
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

513
00:34:48,170 --> 00:34:50,866
>> WHAT ELSE ARE YOU HIDING IN
THIS HOUSE, REGGIE?

514
00:34:50,866 --> 00:34:54,741
>> OH -- OH, THANKS FOR
REMINDING ME.

515
00:34:54,741 --> 00:34:56,944
THINK

516
00:34:57,239 --> 00:34:59,753
HERE, BOY.
TAKE THIS.

517
00:34:59,753 --> 00:35:01,802
YOU EVER HOLD HEAVY METAL
BEFORE?

518
00:35:01,802 --> 00:35:05,428
>> NO, DAD, I'M IN HIGH SCHOOL,
AND I PLAY THE BASSOON.

519
00:35:05,623 --> 00:35:08,704
>> I'M SORRY, SON, I LET YOU
DOWN.

520
00:35:08,704 --> 00:35:11,492
I RAISED YOU SOFT LIKE A BITCH.

521
00:35:11,723 --> 00:35:13,848
>> I DON'T KNOW HOW TO SHOOT A
GUN.

522
00:35:13,848 --> 00:35:16,995
>> YES, THERE ARE BOSNIANS ON
THE WAY COMING TO KILL US

523
00:35:16,995 --> 00:35:18,946
AND
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT, I PLAY THE
BASSOON.

524
00:35:18,946 --> 00:35:21,919
LIKE THAT

525
00:35:21,919 --> 00:35:26,187
>> IT'S ME, GIVE US WHAT WE ARE
OWED.

526
00:35:26,187 --> 00:35:28,541
>> SON?
>> DAD, I CAN'T.

527
00:35:28,541 --> 00:35:30,333
>> ALLOW ME.

528
00:35:36,822 --> 00:35:38,438
>> I BLAME YOU!

529
00:35:38,438 --> 00:35:40,757
>> OH, MY GOD!

530
00:35:43,409 --> 00:35:47,497
>> WHY DO I GOT TO DO EVERYTHING
MYSELF AROUND THIS HOUSE!

531
00:35:47,497 --> 00:35:50,349
>> WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
>> LOOK, BABY, JUST CALM DOWN.

532
00:35:50,349 --> 00:35:53,851
I NEED YOU TO TAKE THIS THUMB
DRIVE, ALL RIGHT?

533
00:35:53,851 --> 00:35:57,315
THERE'S BANK ACCOUNTS, PICTURES,
EVERYTHING'S IN HERE.

534
00:35:57,315 --> 00:36:01,373
TAKE IT.
SICK IT IN YOUR COOCH.
>> WHAT?

535
00:36:01,373 --> 00:36:05,312
NO, I'M NOT DOING THAT.
WHY DON'T YOU PUT IT IN YOUR
ASS?

536
00:36:05,312 --> 00:36:09,549
>> BECAUSE IF I PUT IT IN MY
ASS, WHO'S GOING TO HOLD THE
MAP?

537
00:36:12,226 --> 00:36:15,378
>> COME ON, LET'S BE TEAM
PLAYERS, LET'S GET GOING!

538
00:36:15,378 --> 00:36:19,967
>> YOUR HEAD UP IN YOUR ASS TOO?
WHAT HAVE YOU NOT TOLD OUR
FAMILY?

539
00:36:19,967 --> 00:36:22,151
>> OH, MY FAMILY.

540
00:36:22,151 --> 00:36:24,415
FORGOT ABOUT THIS.

541
00:36:34,797 --> 00:36:38,018
>> LOOK, STOP CALLING ME PAPA IN
FRONT OF MY REAL FAMILY.

542
00:36:38,018 --> 00:36:40,103
TAKE THESE, RUN FOR YOUR LIFE.

543
00:36:40,103 --> 00:36:43,131
GO ON GET.
GO!

544
00:36:45,061 --> 00:36:48,211
>> I'M SORRY, YOU SPEAK FRENCH?

545
00:36:49,186 --> 00:36:51,430
WHO WAS THAT?
WERE THEY LIVING HERE?

546
00:36:51,430 --> 00:36:53,620
>> I TOLD YOU, THERE'S NO TIME
FOR THAT.

547
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:56,247
ALL YOU WANT TO DO IS TALK ABOUT
WHAT IS THIS, WHAT IS THAT?

548
00:36:56,247 --> 00:36:58,573
THE HOUSE IS GOING TO BURN UP.

549
00:36:58,573 --> 00:37:00,871
WE'VE GOT TO GO, LEAVE THE REST.

550
00:37:00,871 --> 00:37:03,690
>> WHAT ABOUT BUSTER?
WE CAN'T LEAVE BUSTER.

551
00:37:04,013 --> 00:37:08,397
>> BUSTER.
COME HERE!

552
00:37:08,397 --> 00:37:13,012
>> I'LL BET HE'S GONE THAT DOG
PROBABLY SAW YOU SHOOT THAT MAN
AND DROVE AWAY IN OUR HYUNDAI.

553
00:37:13,012 --> 00:37:15,370
>> BUSTER, BUSTER.

554
00:37:15,370 --> 00:37:17,270
>> OH, MY GOD.

555
00:37:17,270 --> 00:37:19,912
OH, COME ON, BUSTER.

556
00:37:20,647 --> 00:37:24,446
>> MY GOD, BUSTER, I CAN'T
BELIEVE I ALMOST FORGOT WHAT'S
IMPORTANT.

557
00:37:24,446 --> 00:37:28,153
THIS IS THE CORE OF OUR FAMILY.
HE'S A GOOD BOY.

558
00:37:28,153 --> 00:37:32,200
AND HE GOT SOMETHING VERY
IMPORTANT IN THE STOMACH --

559
00:37:36,397 --> 00:37:38,975
>> DON'T WORRY, I MADE IT QUICK.

560
00:37:39,588 --> 00:37:42,440
OH, STILL MOVING A LITTLE BIT.

561
00:37:48,841 --> 00:37:51,488
>> HERE, BOY.
TAKE A BITE OUT OF IT.

562
00:37:51,488 --> 00:37:55,357
>> NO, NO WAY!
>> YOU A BITCH!

563
00:37:57,762 --> 00:38:02,219
>> I KNEW I SHOULD HAVE STAYED A
LESBIAN LIKE I WAS IN COLLEGE.

564
00:38:02,545 --> 00:38:06,219
>> EXCUSE ME, I GOT TO MAKE A
PHONE CALL.

565
00:38:14,390 --> 00:38:17,084
>> ALL RIGHT, LET'S GET OUT OF
HERE, LET'S GO, LET'S GO.

566
00:38:17,084 --> 00:38:21,783
>> OH, IT'S ANOTHER NOTICE FROM
THE CITY.
THE ALERT WAS A FALSE ALARM.

567
00:38:29,659 --> 00:38:32,690
>> YOU PASSED MY TEST.

568
00:38:32,690 --> 00:38:35,296
JUST GOT TO BE A LITTLE FASTER
NEXT TIME, THAT'S ALL.

569
00:38:35,296 --> 00:38:37,431
>> NO, YOU GOT TO LEAVE, I DON'T
EVEN KNOW YOU.

570
00:38:37,431 --> 00:38:38,886
>> YEAH, MAN, GET OUT OF HERE.

571
00:38:38,886 --> 00:38:40,534
>> ALL RIGHT, FINE.

572
00:38:40,534 --> 00:38:44,501
YOU SEE THE CAT, IT'S GOT A PAGE

WELL, GUYS, IT'S THE DAWN OF A
NEW ERA.

631
00:43:04,568 --> 00:43:08,105
DONALD TRUMP RELEASED HIS
OFFICIAL INAUGURAL PORTRAIT,

632
00:43:08,105 --> 00:43:12,959
AND
THE PHOTO IS LIT
I ASSUME BY HELL OPENING UP.

633
00:43:13,444 --> 00:43:16,663
TRUMP IS TRYING TO LOOK SO
HARD-CORE IN HIS PHOTO,

634
00:43:16,663 --> 00:43:21,198
I'M
SURPRISED HE DIDN'T ADD A
PARENTAL ADVISORY STICKER AND A
DO RAG.

635
00:43:23,252 --> 00:43:28,562
AND THEN TRUMP ALSO RELEASED THE
OFFICIAL PORTRAIT OF J.D. VANCE.

>> DONALD TRUMP'S INAUGURATION
CEREMONY HAS BEEN MOVED INSIDE

PRESIDENT BIDEN DELIVERED A
FAREWELL ADDRESS TO THE NATION ON WEDNESDAY

AND THEN
TRIUMPHANTLY RODE OFF INTO THE
PAVEMENT.

>> IN HIS FAREWELL SPEECH TO THE

FALLS ON MARTIN LUTHER KING DAY,

647
00:44:30,721 --> 00:44:34,464
AND IF DR. KING WERE ALIVE
TODAY, I BED TRUMP WOULD WALK
RIGHT UP TO HIM AND SAY,

648
00:44:34,464 --> 00:44:37,016
"OH,
SNAP, IT'S BEN CARSON!"

649

CEASEFIRE

653
00:44:54,062 --> 00:44:58,765
PRESIDENT BIDEN SAID THAT THE
ISRAEL/HAMAS CEASE-FIRE TALKS

654
00:44:58,765 --> 00:45:01,902
WERE ONE OF THE TOUGHEST
NEGOTIATIONS HE HAD EVER
EXPERIENCED.

655
00:45:01,902 --> 00:45:04,281
THE HARDEST PART WAS CONVINCING BOTH SIDES

656
00:45:04,281 --> 00:45:06,733
THAT HE WAS STILL THE
PRESIDENT.

657

>>> PRESIDENT BIDEN ANNOUNCED
THAT A NAVY AIRCRAFT CARRIER

WILL BE NAMED IN HONOR OF BILL
CLINTON.

659

THE CARRIER WILL ALSO HONOR BILL
CLINTON BY BEING COVERED IN
SEAMEN.

660
00:45:19,739 --> 00:45:24,756
MEN OF THE SEA.
MEN OF THE SEA I SHOULD HAVE
SAID.

TRUMP'S NOMINEE TO LEAD THE
NATION'S HEALTH AGENCIES,

662
00:45:30,013 --> 00:45:32,964
WILL
HAVE HIS SENATE CONFIRMATION
HEARING NEXT WEEK.

663
00:45:32,964 --> 00:45:35,179
RFK HAS BEEN PREPARING FOR THE
HEARINGS

664
00:45:35,179 --> 00:45:38,797
BY SETTING HIS TANNING
BED TO "TROPIC THUNDER."

665
00:45:42,103 --> 00:45:46,485
An agreement in the defamation lawsuit
against Rudy Giuliani has been reached,

666
00:45:46,485 --> 00:45:50,042
which allows him to keep his
Florida condo, Yankees memorabilia,

667
00:45:50,042 --> 00:45:54,189
and his most prized
possession, Secretariat's Teeth.

668
00:45:56,492 --> 00:45:59,506
He's got horse teeth, Colin.

669
00:45:59,506 --> 00:46:05,050
Steve... Steve Bannon attacked Elon Musk,
calling him a truly evil person.

670
00:46:05,050 --> 00:46:07,722
Though technically, Bannon's exact words
were,

671
00:46:07,722 --> 00:46:11,357
Elon Musk-a-de-chuba-ki-ma-da-evil.

672
00:46:12,260 --> 00:46:14,232
Why'd you say it in Italian?

673
00:46:14,232 --> 00:46:18,464
Hours ago...
Hours ago, TikTok went offline in the U.S.

674
00:46:18,464 --> 00:46:24,386
Here to plead one final case for not
banning TikTok is Michael Longfellow.

675
00:46:26,632 --> 00:46:28,894
Che.

676
00:46:34,766 --> 00:46:36,806
Always good to see you, Che.

677
00:46:36,806 --> 00:46:38,952
I wish you were under happier
circumstances.

678
00:46:38,952 --> 00:46:41,613
Well, so you're against the United States
banning TikTok?

679
00:46:41,613 --> 00:46:46,156
Correct.
It's the first political opinion I've ever
had.

680
00:46:46,156 --> 00:46:49,451
I feel it is my responsibility
to come out here

681
00:46:49,451 --> 00:46:52,747
and defend TikTok's right to
remain in these United States.

682
00:46:52,747 --> 00:46:55,409
Well, there are legitimate reasons for
banning TikTok.

683
00:46:55,409 --> 00:46:57,650
Like what?
Because it's Chinese?

684
00:46:57,650 --> 00:47:00,869
So we're just banning things because
they're from China now?

685
00:47:00,869 --> 00:47:03,487
Well, you know who else was from China?

686
00:47:03,624 --> 00:47:08,530
- No, man.
- That's right.
Jesus Christ.

687
00:47:08,530 --> 00:47:10,654
Jesus was not Chinese, man.

688
00:47:10,654 --> 00:47:14,630
I thought he was Middle Eastern,
but I saw it on a TikTok.

689
00:47:14,898 --> 00:47:16,800
Chinese!

690
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:19,886
Jesus Christ was Chinese.

691
00:47:19,886 --> 00:47:23,246
What about the fact they say TikTok is
stealing your data?

692
00:47:23,246 --> 00:47:24,949
Who cares about my data?

693
00:47:24,949 --> 00:47:28,785
Oh, no.
China knows I like thick Latinas.

694
00:47:29,753 --> 00:47:32,798
Who doesn't?
Give me a break.

695
00:47:32,798 --> 00:47:35,276
I mean, that's a fair point.

696
00:47:35,276 --> 00:47:38,975
What about all the research that says it's
bad for your brain?

697
00:47:38,975 --> 00:47:41,934
Ah, this is boring.
I'm bored.

698
00:47:41,934 --> 00:47:44,294
Are you trying to swipe up on me?

699
00:47:44,294 --> 00:47:46,702
Yes!
Why won't you go?

700
00:47:46,702 --> 00:47:50,120
Sorry, I just... I have no attention span
anymore.

701
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:52,320
- I have ADHD.
- I didn't know that.

702
00:47:52,462 --> 00:47:54,923
I'll never forget being diagnosed.

703
00:47:54,923 --> 00:47:59,651
It was last year.
I took a TikTok quiz.

704
00:47:59,651 --> 00:48:03,639
And the third time I took it, it said I
might have ADHD.

705
00:48:03,639 --> 00:48:06,079
That does not mean you have ADHD.

706
00:48:06,079 --> 00:48:09,319
Then why did TikTok give me Adderall?

707
00:48:09,319 --> 00:48:12,239
Which I didn't even know was medicine,
by the way.

708
00:48:12,239 --> 00:48:14,338
The doctor told me, we're giving you
Adderall,

709
00:48:14,338 --> 00:48:18,502
and I was like, oh, cool,
but this is no time to party, doctor.

710
00:48:18,502 --> 00:48:22,213
But I guess people use it to read.

711
00:48:22,436 --> 00:48:24,211
Okay, but even...

712
00:48:24,211 --> 00:48:28,112
But even if you don't want it banned,
what about future generations?

713
00:48:28,112 --> 00:48:31,740
And what have the generations already
lost?

714
00:48:33,866 --> 00:48:37,002
What becomes of us?
How do we live now?

715
00:48:37,002 --> 00:48:39,856
Well, you've lived without TikTok for most
of your life.

716
00:48:39,856 --> 00:48:41,234
You just live like you used to live.

717
00:48:41,234 --> 00:48:44,639
I don't remember how.

718
00:48:44,639 --> 00:48:48,829
I know I lived a life before TikTok.
I must have.

719
00:48:48,829 --> 00:48:50,877
But that boy is dead.

720
00:48:50,877 --> 00:48:54,341
He's dead, and he's never coming back.

721
00:48:54,341 --> 00:48:57,136
Without TikTok, I don't know anything
anymore.

722
00:48:57,136 --> 00:48:58,642
What do I do at work?

723
00:48:58,642 --> 00:49:01,884
What do I even watch during a movie?

724
00:49:01,884 --> 00:49:03,765
Just watch the movie!

725
00:49:03,765 --> 00:49:07,507
But during, Che, when I get bored for like
a few seconds...

726
00:49:07,507 --> 00:49:09,550
Just still watch the movie.

727
00:49:09,550 --> 00:49:10,597
I'm moving to China.

728
00:49:10,597 --> 00:49:12,338
Michael Longfellow, everybody!

729
00:49:12,338 --> 00:49:16,092
This gives zero...

730
00:49:20,210 --> 00:49:25,000
Spikes have been installed on several New
York City subway turnstiles

731
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,266
in an effort
to stop fare evaders,

732
00:49:27,266 --> 00:49:32,483
as well as to provide something
sharp for mentally ill
people to shove you into.

733
00:49:34,961 --> 00:49:40,017
Harry, the miniature donkey who served as
a model for Donkey and the Shrek movies,

734
00:49:40,017 --> 00:49:42,115
has died at the age of
30,

735
00:49:42,115 --> 00:49:46,970
just as he was about to reveal what he saw
at those ditty parties.

736
00:49:49,853 --> 00:49:53,043
I heard that on TikTok, Colin.

737
00:49:53,472 --> 00:49:58,114
Progresso is introducing a new
soup-flavored hard candy

738
00:49:58,114 --> 00:49:59,556
called Soup Drops.

739
00:49:59,556 --> 00:50:03,511
Soup Drops are the brainchild of Progresso's
new CEO,

740
00:50:03,511 --> 00:50:06,441
a deranged, toothless hobo.

741
00:50:09,716 --> 00:50:13,974
A Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonist was
the first person to be arrested,

742
00:50:13,974 --> 00:50:15,831
according to the new
California law

743
00:50:15,831 --> 00:50:19,683
prohibiting the possession of
AI-generated child porn.

744
00:50:19,683 --> 00:50:24,087
Which brings me to my new segment,
Hear Me Out.

745
00:50:34,213 --> 00:50:36,491
Hear Me Out.

746
00:50:36,491 --> 00:50:39,626
Isn't AI-generated child porn

747
00:50:39,626 --> 00:50:43,103
the best
possible solution for pedophiles?

748
00:50:43,103 --> 00:50:44,837
They aren't real kids.

749
00:50:44,837 --> 00:50:49,399
It's just fake kids that are generated by
scanning thousands of real...

750
00:50:49,399 --> 00:50:51,083
Okay, now I see the problem.

751
00:50:51,083 --> 00:50:54,112
This has been Hear Me Out.

752
00:50:59,469 --> 00:51:02,901
New research suggests that by the year
2060,

753
00:51:02,901 --> 00:51:06,388
the number of people in the U.S.
with dementia will double,

754
00:51:06,388 --> 00:51:11,167
and my heart goes out to
all those Jamaican ladies
who have to deal with that.

755
00:51:13,175 --> 00:51:18,766
A new study finds that the country with
the largest average bra size is Norway,

756
00:51:18,766 --> 00:51:23,320
but America still has the largest average
bra size for men.

757
00:51:24,105 --> 00:51:27,670
Hear Me Out.
Hear Me Out.

758
00:51:31,413 --> 00:51:36,149
Louisiana Governor Jeff
Landry has cleared homeless
encampments in New Orleans

759
00:51:36,149 --> 00:51:37,910
ahead of next month's Super Bowl.

760
00:51:37,910 --> 00:51:43,052
No word on where they sent the homeless
people, but on my way in today, a guy did ask me,

761
00:51:43,052 --> 00:51:46,380
uh, you got that there
dollar there, mon ami?

762
00:51:48,441 --> 00:51:51,190
What is going on?

763
00:51:51,190 --> 00:51:55,362
New York City police are searching for the
serial mugger

764
00:51:55,362 --> 00:51:58,247
who makes victims negotiate what he'll steal,

765
00:51:58,247 --> 00:52:01,267
and is
being called the Haggler After Midnight,

766
00:52:01,267 --> 00:52:05,240
which is also my
nickname at the Hustler Club.

767
00:52:07,246 --> 00:52:08,703
I've heard that.

768
00:52:08,703 --> 00:52:12,920
One of the more surprising success stories
at the holiday box office this year

769
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:17,118
was
Nosferatu, a remake of the classic 1922
film.

770
00:52:17,118 --> 00:52:20,660
Here to comment is the original Nosferatu.

771
00:52:28,878 --> 00:52:31,367
Evening

772
00:52:31,367 --> 00:52:35,536
cost oceans of time to find you,

773
00:52:35,536 --> 00:52:39,537
and also the George Washington Bridge.

774
00:52:39,537 --> 00:52:42,644
Traffic was crazy.

775
00:52:42,644 --> 00:52:45,524
I'm cheating.
It's good to see you, Colin.

776
00:52:45,524 --> 00:52:49,032
Oh, well, it's great to have you here too,
original Nosferatu.

777
00:52:49,032 --> 00:52:53,091
Wow, wow.
It's much smaller than I imagined.

778
00:52:53,091 --> 00:52:55,580
Yes, I know.
People are always saying that about the
studio.

779
00:52:55,580 --> 00:53:00,198
Not the studio!
Your penis, Colin!

780
00:53:00,445 --> 00:53:04,619
During

781
00:53:04,619 --> 00:53:07,064
That's very funny, Nosferatu.

782
00:53:07,064 --> 00:53:09,169
Oh, my God, it is out.

783
00:53:10,116 --> 00:53:12,933
I must have been like that all day.

784
00:53:12,933 --> 00:53:16,248
God, I visited sick kids at the hospital.

785
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:22,417
And for those of you wondering,
he looked just like me.

786
00:53:22,417 --> 00:53:26,173
Weird, white, and pointy.

787
00:53:30,482 --> 00:53:32,712
Okay, I'm just, I'm gonna ignore that.

788
00:53:32,712 --> 00:53:34,788
Uh, anyway, I'm very curious.

789
00:53:34,788 --> 00:53:37,871
What did you think of the new Nosferatu
movie?

790
00:53:37,871 --> 00:53:40,962
I thought it sucked!

791
00:53:42,335 --> 00:53:46,044
- Vampire humor sucked.
- Yeah.
No, really good.

792
00:53:46,044 --> 00:53:50,815
Speaking of, I want to suck your veiny
neck!

793
00:53:50,815 --> 00:53:53,767
Okay, please do not touch me with your
cold, slimy fingers.

794
00:53:53,767 --> 00:53:57,629
Said your former assistant!

795
00:53:59,503 --> 00:54:03,207
No, I'm cheating, I'm cheating.
I really like the movie.

796
00:54:03,207 --> 00:54:06,926
Although it, like, would
have been nice to,
like, get an audition,

797
00:54:06,926 --> 00:54:09,514
like, heat me up, bro.

798
00:54:09,514 --> 00:54:13,880
All right, I gotta say,
it sounds like you
might be a little jealous
of the new Nosferatu.

799
00:54:13,880 --> 00:54:16,048
Jealous of what, Colin?

800
00:54:16,048 --> 00:54:19,310
He doesn't even look like the Nosferatu!

801
00:54:19,310 --> 00:54:22,551
The guy is, like, jacked and has,
like, a mustache.

802
00:54:22,551 --> 00:54:27,006
He looks like shirtless Ned Flanders!

803
00:54:29,820 --> 00:54:33,335
Like, how did he even get so swole?

804
00:54:33,335 --> 00:54:36,506
Vampires only do one sit-up a day!

805
00:54:36,506 --> 00:54:41,010
And it's like this, Colin!
It's like this!

806
00:54:51,290 --> 00:54:54,922
Really, very, very impressive.

807
00:54:56,217 --> 00:54:59,384
I think you might just be a little jealous
of the new Nosferatu,

808
00:54:59,384 --> 00:55:02,949
because you can barely do one sit-up, and you can't grow
any facial hair.

809
00:55:02,949 --> 00:55:06,886
Whatever, Colin.
You can't grow a mustache either.

810
00:55:06,886 --> 00:55:09,363
Okay, okay, stop.
You're gonna give me a nosebleed?

811
00:55:09,363 --> 00:55:11,848
The last thing I need is you sucking on my
nose.

812
00:55:11,848 --> 00:55:14,516
Suck on your nose?
Really?

813
00:55:14,516 --> 00:55:18,451
No, thanks.
I don't want to be up all night.

814
00:55:20,696 --> 00:55:24,513
Cocaine, Colin!

815
00:55:26,322 --> 00:55:29,330
Yes.
Thank you.
I got that Nosferatu.

816
00:55:29,330 --> 00:55:34,482
Noseferatu?
Well, you've got a nose for coke,
dude.

817
00:55:36,769 --> 00:55:38,874
Okay, don't encourage him.

818
00:55:38,874 --> 00:55:41,726
You seem really amped up yourself.

819
00:55:41,726 --> 00:55:45,779
I need to suck some blood.
I'm thirsty, Colin.

820
00:55:45,779 --> 00:55:50,365
Well, guess it's time to visit my favorite
cast member,

821
00:55:50,365 --> 00:55:52,518
that's Sarah Sherman.

822
00:55:52,518 --> 00:55:54,911
Oh, yes.
And why is she your favorite?

823
00:55:54,911 --> 00:55:58,093
Because she's been on her period

824
00:55:58,093 --> 00:56:01,908
for three
years straight.

825
00:56:01,908 --> 00:56:03,878
Good Lord.

826
00:56:03,878 --> 00:56:07,509
Well, you know what I always say.

827
00:56:07,509 --> 00:56:11,738
If there's blood on the field,
play ball.

828
00:56:17,691 --> 00:56:19,417
Nosferatu, everyone.

829
00:56:19,417 --> 00:56:21,684
I like the movie.
I like it.

830
00:56:21,684 --> 00:56:26,314
FOR

831
00:56:57,599 --> 00:56:59,642
Mr. Curtis.

832
00:56:59,642 --> 00:57:03,007
Officers, please help.
You've got to help me find my girlfriend.

833
00:57:03,007 --> 00:57:05,398
Okay, well, now that we've got
her name and address,

834
00:57:05,398 --> 00:57:09,149
all we need now is a physical description
so we can broadcast it wide.

835
00:57:09,149 --> 00:57:12,545
We'll put her information on the news,
the paper,
and the posters all over town.

836
00:57:12,545 --> 00:57:13,875
Oh, sure.
Whatever you need.

837
00:57:13,875 --> 00:57:17,706
- Okay, here we go.
Eye color.
- Brown.

838
00:57:17,706 --> 00:57:19,779
Height.
Five-six.

839
00:57:19,779 --> 00:57:23,014
Great.
And her weight.

840
00:57:26,827 --> 00:57:31,765
- I'm sorry?
- Uh, how much does she weigh?

841
00:57:34,671 --> 00:57:37,189
If you don't know, just guess.

842
00:57:37,189 --> 00:57:41,866
So you want me to say a number of what I
think her weight is

843
00:57:41,866 --> 00:57:43,743
on record?

844
00:57:43,743 --> 00:57:48,297
Uh, sorry.
Excuse me.
I just, uh, need to take this trash out
real quick.

845
00:57:48,297 --> 00:57:50,497
It's her trap.

846
00:57:50,980 --> 00:57:54,472
Mr. Curtis, we legally need to put
something down.

847
00:57:54,472 --> 00:57:57,307
Just a number, okay?
What is her weight?

848
00:57:59,992 --> 00:58:05,467
Okay, well, personally, I've never really
thought about my girlfriend's weight.

849
00:58:06,751 --> 00:58:08,349
Uh, seriously?

850
00:58:08,349 --> 00:58:10,223
Um, all right.
Uh, look.

851
00:58:10,223 --> 00:58:15,292
If you were to buy her a jacket,
what size jacket would she wear?

852
00:58:16,581 --> 00:58:19,246
Uh, tiny, tiny, tiny.

853
00:58:21,177 --> 00:58:24,230
Hello, this is the police.

854
00:58:29,264 --> 00:58:32,993
Uh, look.
Buddy, I have to put a number on the form

855
00:58:32,993 --> 00:58:37,767
or we cannot proceed, okay?
So please, take this as seriously as
possible.

856
00:58:37,767 --> 00:58:41,732
Look, I do.
And I'm trying, okay?
It's, uh...

857
00:58:41,732 --> 00:58:44,473
One, six...

858
00:58:44,473 --> 00:58:48,008
Two

859
00:58:48,008 --> 00:58:50,635
85 pounds.
85.

860
00:58:50,635 --> 00:58:54,768
85 pounds?
She's that small?

861
00:58:54,768 --> 00:58:58,767
Okay, uh, let's move on.
What is your girlfriend's race?

862
00:58:58,767 --> 00:59:00,717
She black.

863
00:59:02,627 --> 00:59:05,592
Okay, and how old is she?

864
00:59:10,317 --> 00:59:12,439
She grown.

865
00:59:12,439 --> 00:59:15,708
Okay, and what does she do for work?

866
00:59:19,607 --> 00:59:21,807
She a queen.

867
00:59:21,807 --> 00:59:24,564
Uh, all right.

868
00:59:24,564 --> 00:59:27,253
You know, look, Mr. Curtis,
are there any unique

869
00:59:27,253 --> 00:59:29,869
identifying features your
girlfriend might have?

870
00:59:29,869 --> 00:59:33,032
Birthmark?
Anything specific?

871
00:59:33,441 --> 00:59:36,530
Oh, a beautiful soul.
She got a beautiful soul.

872
00:59:38,538 --> 00:59:41,766
All right, uh, let me see if I got this
straight,

873
00:59:41,766 --> 00:59:46,519
because again, this is the
information we're going to put all over
the news.

874
00:59:46,519 --> 00:59:49,249
So on the news, they're going to say,
and I quote,

875
00:59:49,249 --> 00:59:54,715
authorities in Trenton County
are looking for a tiny 85-pound

876
00:59:54,715 --> 00:59:59,767
grown
black queen with a beautiful soul?

877
01:00:02,787 --> 01:00:04,802
Yes, that is exactly right.

878
01:00:04,802 --> 01:00:08,187
And when you find her, you tell her,
that's what I told you to put on a poster.

879
01:00:08,187 --> 01:00:12,644
Okay, so then your girlfriend looks like
this.

880
01:00:14,723 --> 01:00:16,683
Ah, sorry, sorry, that's not right.

881
01:00:16,683 --> 01:00:19,678
You, uh, forgot her crown.

882
01:00:19,678 --> 01:00:22,071
Jesus Christ.

883
01:00:24,016 --> 01:00:26,763
Well, this was a waste of time,

884
01:00:26,763 --> 01:00:30,874
but I guess we need to get this APA out as
soon as possible

885
01:00:30,874 --> 01:00:32,604
if we have any chance of
finding her.

886
01:00:32,604 --> 01:00:37,816
So we will contact you when we have any
information, Mr. Curtis.

887
01:00:40,894 --> 01:00:43,200
Well done, son.

888
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:46,710
Ah, thank you, I guess.
But what happens now?

889
01:00:46,710 --> 01:00:48,008
How do I know they're going to find her?

890
01:00:48,008 --> 01:00:50,973
Oh, don't worry, kid.
I was in your shoes once.

891
01:00:50,973 --> 01:00:53,270
My wife went missing,
and I came in here,

892
01:00:53,270 --> 01:00:55,805
and they asked me to guess
how much she weighed.

893
01:00:55,805 --> 01:00:59,979
- But I got out of there without ever saying
a number.
- Wait.

894
01:00:59,979 --> 01:01:04,083
- And they still... they still found her?
- No, of course not.

895
01:01:04,083 --> 01:01:06,673
But they brought me back somebody better.

896
01:01:06,673 --> 01:01:08,213
Good luck, brother.

897
01:01:08,213 --> 01:01:11,817
Try not to slip in that blood over there.
I ain't good at mopping.
