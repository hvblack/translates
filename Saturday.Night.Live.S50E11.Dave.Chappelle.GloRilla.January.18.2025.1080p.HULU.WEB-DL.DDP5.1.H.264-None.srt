1
00:04:59,999 --> 00:05:03,802
LOOK, QUEBEC SUPPLIES TWO-THIRDS
OF OUR RAW ALUMINUM.

2
00:05:03,804 --> 00:05:04,970
WHEN YOU CONSIDER THE IMPORTANCE

3
00:05:04,972 --> 00:05:06,772
OF HYDROELECTRIC POWER, OH, MY

4
00:05:06,774 --> 00:05:07,673
GOD, I CAN'T EVEN FINISH, THAT

5
00:05:07,675 --> 00:05:14,012
IS SO BORING, I'M SORRY.

6
00:05:14,014 --> 00:05:14,379
>> OH, OH!

7
00:05:14,381 --> 00:05:15,514
>> AND AMERICA HAS JUST DECLARED

8
00:05:15,516 --> 00:05:18,050
WAR ON SHARKS.

9
00:05:18,052 --> 00:05:18,750
>> THAT -- YES.

10
00:05:18,752 --> 00:05:19,685
>> I LOVE THAT.

11
00:05:19,687 --> 00:05:22,788
>> NOTHING BETTER.

12
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:25,057
>> >> TRUMP JUST GAVE A

13
00:05:25,059 --> 00:05:26,692
STATEMENT ABOUT THE TIKTOK BAN.

14
00:05:26,694 --> 00:05:28,160
I CAN PRETEND I'M METHOD

15
00:05:28,162 --> 00:05:29,127
CURIOUS, BUT LET'S JUST WATCH

16
00:05:29,129 --> 00:05:29,695
THE WHOLE THING.

17
00:05:29,697 --> 00:05:31,596
>> YES, WE LOVE TIKTOK, DON'T

18
00:05:31,598 --> 00:05:33,365
WE, WE USED TO HATE IT BUT THEN

19
00:05:33,367 --> 00:05:35,467
IT QUITE FRANKLY, IN MANY WAYS,

20
00:05:35,469 --> 00:05:35,934
GOT ME ELECTED.

21
00:05:35,936 --> 00:05:38,370
SO NOW WE LOVE IT.

22
00:05:38,372 --> 00:05:42,174
WE ALSO LOVE THE RIZZLER, DON'T

23
00:05:42,176 --> 00:05:43,275
WE, FOLKS?

24
00:05:43,277 --> 00:05:45,277
THEY'RE TRYING TO TAKE THE

25
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:46,845
RIZZLER AWAY FROM US, SO SAD,

26
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:47,946
THEY WANT HIM THE HELL OUT OF

27
00:05:47,948 --> 00:05:48,246
HERE.

28
00:05:48,248 --> 00:05:50,215
WE DO LOVE COSTCO GUYS, BOOM!

29
00:05:50,217 --> 00:05:51,817
AND WE'RE DOING, GET READY WITH

30
00:05:51,819 --> 00:05:52,884
ME, THAT'S GOING TO BE FUN.

31
00:05:52,886 --> 00:05:54,486
AND WE'RE DOING THE CHALLENGES.

32
00:05:54,488 --> 00:05:55,387
REMEMBER ICE BUCKET?

33
00:05:55,389 --> 00:05:55,921
WE LOVED ICE BUCKET.

34
00:05:55,923 --> 00:05:58,023
ANYWAY.

35
00:05:58,425 --> 00:06:02,427
WE MAY HAVE TO GO OVER TO REELZ

36
00:06:02,429 --> 00:06:04,196
WITH MARK ZUCKERBERG.

37
00:06:04,198 --> 00:06:06,531
I LIKE HIM NOW.

38
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:09,468
ZUCK, HE LOOKS MUCH BETTER IN

39
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:10,602
REGARDS TO PERM AND WITH REGARD

40
00:06:10,604 --> 00:06:11,370
TO CHAIN.

41
00:06:11,772 --> 00:06:14,539
AND HE WILL, OF COURSE, BE AT MY

42
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:15,474
INAUGURATION, WHICH WILL BE

43
00:06:15,476 --> 00:06:15,807
INDOORS.

44
00:06:15,809 --> 00:06:18,944
TOO MANY PEOPLE TO FIT OUTSIDE.

45
00:06:19,346 --> 00:06:20,645
YOU KNOW, WE'RE EXCITED.

46
00:06:20,647 --> 00:06:23,749
WE'RE VERY EXCITED TO BE

47
00:06:23,751 --> 00:06:24,783
INAUGURATED ON MARTIN LUTHER

48
00:06:24,785 --> 00:06:25,384
KING DAY.

49
00:06:25,386 --> 00:06:27,219
I LIKE SHARING THE DAY.

50
00:06:27,221 --> 00:06:29,388
AND WE'RE EXCITED ABOUT MY

51
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:30,455
LATEST CABINET PICK.

52
00:06:30,457 --> 00:06:31,156
IT'S SOMEONE I KNOW YOU'LL BE

53
00:06:31,158 --> 00:06:32,324
VERY EXCITED TO SEE.

54
00:06:32,326 --> 00:06:34,826
GEORGE SANTOS.

55
00:06:34,828 --> 00:06:35,360
>> HELLO, EVERYONE.

56
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:48,006
YES, IT'S ME, GEORGE SANTOS, AKA

57
00:06:48,008 --> 00:06:52,811
KIT DAUGHTER RA KIVASHA, AKA

58
00:06:52,813 --> 00:06:56,281
CHARLIE CHALAMET.

59
00:06:56,283 --> 00:06:59,217
I'M SO HONORED TO BE JOINING

60
00:06:59,219 --> 00:06:59,951
TRUMP'S CABINET AS SECRETARY OF

61
00:06:59,953 --> 00:07:00,385
FACT CHECKING.

62
00:07:00,387 --> 00:07:01,019
AND AMBASSADOR TO SEPHORA.

63
00:07:01,021 --> 00:07:01,753
I AM PART OF THE POLITICIAN TO

64
00:07:01,755 --> 00:07:02,454
CAMEO BACK TO POLITICIAN AND

65
00:07:02,456 --> 00:07:03,121
EVENTUALLY TO JAIL PIPELINE.

66
00:07:03,123 --> 00:07:03,755
BUT WHILE I'M EXCITED FOR

67
00:07:03,757 --> 00:07:04,456
MONDAY, THIS HAS BEEN A VERY

68
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:07,159
HARD MONTH FOR ME.

69
00:07:07,161 --> 00:07:08,693
I AM SO SAD ABOUT THE PASSING OF

70
00:07:08,695 --> 00:07:09,661
JIMMY CARTER.

71
00:07:09,663 --> 00:07:12,164
HE HAD A GREAT INFLUENCE ON ME,

72
00:07:12,166 --> 00:07:12,697
SINCE HE WAS MY DAD.

73
00:07:15,035 --> 00:07:16,334
NOW, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME, I'M

74
00:07:16,336 --> 00:07:18,136
LATE FOR A DATE WITH MY

75
00:07:18,138 --> 00:07:23,141
BOYFRIEND, LUIGI MANGIONE.

76
00:07:23,143 --> 00:07:24,976
>> WE ARE ALMOST OUT OF TIME, SO

77
00:07:24,978 --> 00:07:25,811
LET'S JUST TRY TO END THIS

78
00:07:25,813 --> 00:07:26,478
BEFORE ANOTHER TWEET COMES

79
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,512
THROUGH.

80
00:07:27,514 --> 00:07:30,515
OH -- TOO LATE.

81
00:07:30,517 --> 00:07:32,918
IT APPEARS THAT TRUMP IS

82
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:35,220
WATCHING AND LIVE TWEETING THIS

83
00:07:35,222 --> 00:07:37,055
PROGRAM RIGHT NOW.

84
00:07:37,057 --> 00:07:40,058
HE JUST SAID, "I'M STUCK

85
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:43,395
WATCHING MS-DNC, AWFUL ANCHORS

86
00:07:43,397 --> 00:07:47,699
THIS LINEUP LOOKS LIKE

87
00:07:47,701 --> 00:07:50,101
SCOOBY-DOO: OOPS, ALL VELMA.

88
00:07:50,103 --> 00:07:53,004
>> HE'S GOING AT IT, WE STILL

89
00:07:53,006 --> 00:07:53,338
GOT IT.

90
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:54,072
>> AND LIVE FROM NEW YORK, IT'S

91
00:07:54,074 --> 00:07:59,744
SATURDAY NIGHT!

92
00:07:59,746 --> 00:08:00,445
>> Announcer: IT'S "SATURDAY

93
00:08:00,447 --> 00:08:04,649
NIGHT LIVE" WITH --

94
00:10:05,404 --> 00:10:08,373
GLORILLA.

95
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:15,146
AND YOUR HOST, DAVE CHAPPELLE.

96
00:10:06,148 --> 00:10:10,757
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN -- DAVE
CHAPPELLE!

97
00:10:30,469 --> 00:10:33,005
>>> THANK YOU.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

98
00:10:33,005 --> 00:10:34,649
TURN THIS UP, I CAN'T HEAR.

99
00:10:34,649 --> 00:10:36,752
THANK YOU, GUYS.

100
00:10:37,006 --> 00:10:38,710
BOY.

101
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:40,447
I GOT TO TELL YOU GUYS
SOMETHING.

102
00:10:40,447 --> 00:10:42,414
I'M BEING VERY HONEST.

103
00:10:42,414 --> 00:10:46,127
I AM IN QUITE THE PICKLE
TONIGHT.

104
00:10:46,127 --> 00:10:50,683
AND IT STARTED -- IT STARTED IN
OCTOBER.

105
00:10:50,683 --> 00:10:52,415
LORNE MICHAELS CALLED ME.

106
00:10:52,415 --> 00:10:55,803
AND HE ASKED ME TO DO "SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE"

107
00:10:55,803 --> 00:10:58,043
THE FIRST EPISODE
AFTER THE ELECTION.

108
00:10:58,043 --> 00:11:00,925
AND I WAS LIKE, NAH, MAN, I'M
COOL.

109
00:11:08,687 --> 00:11:09,925
AND HE'S LIKE," WHY NOT?"

110
00:11:09,925 --> 00:11:11,604
"YOU KNOW, THINGS ARE GOING GOOD,

111
00:11:11,604 --> 00:11:14,192
I FINISHED MY NETFLIX
DEAL, I GOT ALL THIS MONEY AND
STUFF."

112
00:11:14,192 --> 00:11:15,751
OH, MAN, PLEASE?

113
00:11:15,751 --> 00:11:18,595
"YOU KNOW WHAT I'LL DO?"

114
00:11:18,595 --> 00:11:22,961
SAVE THE DATE CLOSEST TO JANUARY
6th."

115
00:11:27,109 --> 00:11:30,302
AND THEN THE DATE STARTED ROLLING AROUND

116
00:11:30,302 --> 00:11:32,854
AND IN DECEMBER
HE STARTED CALLING ME AGAIN.

117
00:11:32,854 --> 00:11:34,546
AND AGAIN I WAS LIKE, "I DON'T
WANT TO DO IT."

118
00:11:34,546 --> 00:11:37,407
AND THIS GOES ON FOR WEEKS AND
WEEKS.

119
00:11:37,407 --> 00:11:39,588
AND FINALLY, I GO, YOU KNOW
WHAT?

120
00:11:39,588 --> 00:11:42,497
I COULD JUST GET RID OF ALL
THESE OLD TRUMP JOKES

121
00:11:42,497 --> 00:11:46,907
AND START
FRESH.
I SAY, "YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'LL DO IT."

122
00:11:48,679 --> 00:11:50,527
THANK YOU.

123
00:11:50,413 --> 00:11:52,874
HERE WE ALL ARE.

124
00:11:54,364 --> 00:11:57,033
THE MOMENT I SAID YES,

125
00:11:57,033 --> 00:12:00,098
L.A. BURST INTO FLAMES.

126
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:06,082
AND IT'S A TOUGH ONE, YOU KNOW
WHAT I MEAN?

127
00:12:06,082 --> 00:12:07,862
BECAUSE I'M TIRED OF BEING
CONTROVERSIAL.

128
00:12:07,862 --> 00:12:09,386
I'M TRYING TO TURN OVER A NEW
LEAF.

129
00:12:09,386 --> 00:12:13,473
AND IT IS WAY TOO SOON.

130
00:12:13,473 --> 00:12:17,059
TO DO JOKES ABOUT A CATASTROPHE
LIKE THAT.

131
00:12:21,194 --> 00:12:23,132
IT IS.

132
00:12:23,132 --> 00:12:26,147
YOU KNOW, WHAT'S CRAZY ABOUT IT
IS THIS ONE HITS CLOSE TO HOME,

133
00:12:26,147 --> 00:12:29,228
AND I DON'T LIVE IN L.A.
I'VE NEVER BEEN A BIG FAN OF
L.A.

134
00:12:29,228 --> 00:12:31,715
BUT I'VE BUILT MANY, MANY
MEMORIES THERE,

135
00:12:31,715 --> 00:12:33,204
AND I HAVE GREAT
FRIENDS THERE.

136
00:12:33,204 --> 00:12:35,038
AND A LOT OF THEM LOST THEIR
HOMES.

137
00:12:35,038 --> 00:12:38,675
CARY ELWES, STARRED IN "MEN IN TIGHTS" WITH,

138
00:12:38,686 --> 00:12:40,636
HOUSE BURNED TO
THE GROUND.

139
00:12:40,636 --> 00:12:44,048
MAD LIB, WHO WAS ON "SATURDAY
NIGHT LIVE" LAST TIME I WAS HERE,

140
00:12:44,048 --> 00:12:46,266
HOUSE BURNT TO THE GROUND.

141
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:47,802
SO MANY, I COULD GO ON AND ON.

142
00:12:47,802 --> 00:12:49,384
MY FIRST
DENNIS QUAID,

143
00:12:49,384 --> 00:12:52,622
I SAW HIM ON THE
NEWS WITH TEARS IN HIS EYES,

144
00:12:52,622 --> 00:12:54,331
AND IT BROKE MY HEART.

145
00:12:54,331 --> 00:12:58,900
THEN I GO ON THE INTERNET, AND I
WATCH THESE FIRE VIDEOS,

146
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:00,876
AND I
READ THE COMMENT SECTIONS AND
EVERYONE'S LIKE,

147
00:13:00,876 --> 00:13:03,394
YAH, IT SERVES
THESE CELEBRITIES RIGHT,

148
00:13:03,394 --> 00:13:05,530
I HOPE
THEIR HOUSES BURN DOWN!

149
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:09,320
YOU SEE THAT?
THAT RIGHT THERE?

150
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:12,742
THAT'S WHY I HATE POOR PEOPLE.

151
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:20,554
BECAUSE THEY CAN'T SEE PAST
THEIR OWN PAIN.

152
00:13:27,845 --> 00:13:30,507
OTHER DAY ON THE NEWS --

153
00:13:32,518 --> 00:13:35,933
THE OTHER DAY ON THE NEWS, THEY SAID
THESE FIRES WERE THE MOST

154
00:13:35,933 --> 00:13:39,191
EXPENSIVE TRAGEDY THAT EVER
HAPPENED.
NATURAL DISASTER.

155
00:13:39,191 --> 00:13:41,366
THEY SAID MOST EXPENSIVE NATURAL DISASTER

156
00:13:41,366 --> 00:13:43,995
THAT'S EVER HAPPENED IN
UNITED STATES HISTORY.

157
00:13:43,995 --> 00:13:46,463
AND YOU WANT TO KNOW WHY I THINK
THAT IS?

158
00:13:46,463 --> 00:13:49,820
BECAUSE PEOPLE IN L.A. HAVE NICE
STUFF.

159
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:52,553
I COULD BURN 40,000 ACRES IN
MISSISSIPPI

160
00:13:52,553 --> 00:13:55,081
FOR 6 OR $700.

161
00:14:05,276 --> 00:14:07,977
AND NOW, AND NOW --

162
00:14:08,781 --> 00:14:12,700
AND NOW WE WATCH THE NEWS OR TALK TO MY
FRIENDS,

163
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:16,172
THEY ALL HAVE THESE
CONSPIRACY THEORIES WHAT ARE
THESE FIRES?

164
00:14:16,172 --> 00:14:18,802
THEY SAY IT'S ARSONISTS.
I'VE HEARD THIS THEORY,

165
00:14:18,802 --> 00:14:20,945
AND I'M
SURE THERE WAS SOME ARSONISTS.

166
00:14:20,945 --> 00:14:23,349
BUT THERE WERE A LOT OF ELEMENTS
THAT CAME TOGETHER

167
00:14:23,349 --> 00:14:25,382
TO MAKE THIS
FIRE THE CATASTROPHE THAT IT
WAS.

168
00:14:25,382 --> 00:14:27,362
THE WINDS WERE 100 MILES AN
HOUR.

169
00:14:27,362 --> 00:14:30,495
L.A. WAS DRY AS A BONE AND THE LEVIES

170
00:14:30,495 --> 00:14:32,196
AND IT WAS TOO MANY
FACTORS.

171
00:14:32,196 --> 00:14:34,915
IF YOU WERE A RATIONAL THINKING PERSON,

172
00:14:34,915 --> 00:14:38,118
YOU HAVE TO AT LEAST
CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY

173
00:14:38,118 --> 00:14:40,976
THAT
GOD HATES THESE PEOPLE.

174
00:14:44,762 --> 00:14:47,415
SODOMITES!

175
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:55,301
AND THAT'S NOT TRUE, BECAUSE --
BECAUSE WEST HOLLYWOOD WAS
UNSCATHED.

176
00:14:55,778 --> 00:15:00,721
BECAUSE, HOW CAN YOU BURN WHAT
IS ALREADY FLAMING?

177
00:15:09,058 --> 00:15:11,970
A LOT OF POOR PEOPLE WERE
AFFECTED, TOO.

178
00:15:12,046 --> 00:15:15,160
A LOT OF JUST REGULAR
WORKING-CLASS FAMILIES WERE
AFFECTED, TOO.

179
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:18,796
A LOT OF THOSE FAMILIES FOUND
OUT THE WEEK OF THE FIRES

180
00:15:18,796 --> 00:15:22,008
THAT THEY LOST THEIR HEALTH -- NOT
THEIR HEALTH, THEIR FIRE
INSURANCE.

181
00:15:22,008 --> 00:15:25,661
BUT EITHER WAY, LUIGI IS LIKE,
YOU'RE WELCOME.

182
00:15:27,642 --> 00:15:30,387
YOU KNOW LUIGI, KILLED THEM.

183
00:15:30,849 --> 00:15:35,016
AND THAT KID DID ALMOST PLAN
LIKE THE PERFECT CRIME.

184
00:15:35,016 --> 00:15:37,567
HE DID EVERYTHING RIGHT, PLANNED
EVERYTHING PERFECTLY.

185
00:15:37,567 --> 00:15:41,175
ONLY THING HE FORGOT WAS TO
SHAVE HIS EYEBROWS.

186
00:15:41,175 --> 00:15:44,796
SO THAT'S HIM.

187
00:15:47,591 --> 00:15:49,860
FINALLY, THEY GET IN THE FRONT
OF IT.

188
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:53,051
THIS WEEK, THANK GOD, THESE
FIRES, SUBSIDING.

189
00:15:53,051 --> 00:15:56,578
AND NOT WITHOUT HELP.
A LOT OF COUNTRIES PITCHED IN.

190
00:15:56,578 --> 00:15:59,450
CANADA SENT PLANES THAT HELPED
US OUT.

191
00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:01,727
MEXICO SENT FIREFIGHTERS.

192
00:16:01,727 --> 00:16:05,457
AND TRUMP WAS LIKE, "MAKE SURE
THEY LEAVE WHEN THEY'RE
FINISHED."

193
00:16:11,455 --> 00:16:14,027
TRUMP'S A WILD GUY.

194
00:16:15,456 --> 00:16:16,856
HE'S A WILD GUY.

195
00:16:16,856 --> 00:16:19,934
I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING HE DID
THAT MADE ME CRAZY WHEN HE WAS
RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT.

196
00:16:19,934 --> 00:16:22,788
WHEN HE WAS RUNNING FOR
PRESIDENT, HE SAID THIS AT A
DEBATE.

197
00:16:22,788 --> 00:16:27,551
HE SAID THE HAITIANS IN
SPRINGFIELD, OHIO,

198
00:16:27,833 --> 00:16:31,322
WERE EATING
PEOPLE'S DOGS AND CATS.

199
00:16:31,322 --> 00:16:34,787
THAT REALLY UPSET ME, BECAUSE I
LIVE IN OHIO. IN FACT, I LIVE --

200
00:16:34,787 --> 00:16:36,831
WHAT'S UP,
OHIO?

201
00:16:37,468 --> 00:16:41,361
I LIVE ONE TOWN OVER FROM
SPRINGFIELD.

202
00:16:41,361 --> 00:16:43,815
THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE FROM OHIO,
I HOPE YOU KNOW,

203
00:16:43,815 --> 00:16:46,786
THAT'S NOT
WHAT'S HAPPENING IN SPRINGFIELD
AT ALL.

204
00:16:46,786 --> 00:16:49,365
WHAT HAPPENED IN SPRINGFIELD IS
A LOT OF JOBS WENT AWAY.

205
00:16:49,365 --> 00:16:53,803
20,000 HAITIAN IMMIGRANTS WERE
MOVED THERE BY OUR GOVERNMENT, LEGALLY,

206
00:16:53,803 --> 00:16:56,185
AND THEY PAID MARKET VALUE FOR THEIR RENTS,

207
00:16:56,185 --> 00:17:00,037
AND THEY
SAVED A LOT OF COMPANIES BECAUSE
THEY DID JOBS THE WHITES WEREN'T
DOING.

208
00:17:00,037 --> 00:17:04,499
IT'S NOT THAT THE WHITES
COULDN'T DO THESE JOBS, BUT THEY
WERE BUSY DOING OTHER THINGS.

209
00:17:04,499 --> 00:17:07,630
HEROIN, SLEEPING ON THE STREETS,
YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS.

210
00:17:14,393 --> 00:17:18,259
AND THOSE COMMUNITIES ARE
IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES WHO TEND
TO BE VERY SUCCESSFUL.

211
00:17:18,259 --> 00:17:20,506
THEY DON'T COME TO AMERICA TO
NOT BE RICH.

212
00:17:20,506 --> 00:17:23,149
WHEN HE SAID THAT, THAT
COMMUNITY CAUGHT HELL.

213
00:17:23,149 --> 00:17:25,356
THERE WAS LIKE A JEALOUSY THAT
RAN THROUGH THE COMMUNITY.

214
00:17:25,356 --> 00:17:26,759
THERE WAS NOTHING I COULD DO
ABOUT IT.

215
00:17:26,759 --> 00:17:30,019
BUT BECAUSE I WAS FAMOUS I SAID,
LET ME JUST BE SUPPORTIVE.

216
00:17:30,019 --> 00:17:35,668
SO EVERY DAY FOR LIKE TEN DAYS I
WOULD DRIVE A FEW MILES OVER TO SPRINGFIELD

217
00:17:35,668 --> 00:17:37,680
AND EAT LUNCH AT THE
HAITIAN RESTAURANT.

218
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:42,496
I LET THEM KNOW, IF I'M SAFE
HERE, YOU GUYS ARE DEFINITELY
SAFE HERE.

219
00:17:42,496 --> 00:17:45,033
AND TO BE HONEST WITH YOU,

220
00:17:45,831 --> 00:17:48,721
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEAT WAS.

221
00:17:53,454 --> 00:17:58,830
BUT WHATEVER IT WAS, IT FELL
RIGHT OFF THE BONE, I'LL TELL
YOU THAT.

222
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:06,796
NOW I'M EVEN GETTING NERVOUS AT
OHIO.

223
00:18:06,796 --> 00:18:09,090
I MIGHT LEAVE WITH THE HAITIANS.

224
00:18:09,471 --> 00:18:10,889
NO, I'M SERIOUS, MAN.

225
00:18:10,889 --> 00:18:14,493
YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS, MAN?
IT'S JUST NO FUN BEING FAMOUS
ANYMORE.

226
00:18:14,493 --> 00:18:16,551
IT'S LIKE, OH, Y'ALL MADE IT
SCARY.

227
00:18:16,551 --> 00:18:17,995
YOU KNOW WHAT IT FEELS LIKE,
BEING FAMOUS?

228
00:18:17,995 --> 00:18:19,530
SCARY IS THE RIGHT WORD.

229
00:18:19,530 --> 00:18:23,120
IT FEELS LIKE, AND I'M NOT BEING
DRAMATIC.

230
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:27,307
IT FEELS LIKE I'M STORMING THE
BEACH AT NORMANDY, WORLD WAR II.

231
00:18:27,307 --> 00:18:30,311
BUT I GOT TO KEEP A HAPPY
EXPRESSION ON MY FACE ALL THE
TIME.

232
00:18:30,311 --> 00:18:34,799
IMAGINE ALL THE DANGERS STORMING
THE BEACH BUT I STILL --

233
00:18:35,727 --> 00:18:40,218
BOATS ARE WHIZZING BY, STUFF IS
EXPLODING, I'M JUST LIKE --

234
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:42,703
EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE, SOMETHING
TERRIBLE HAPPENS.

235
00:18:42,703 --> 00:18:47,114
POW!
OH, NO!
POPPY GOT HIT!

236
00:18:50,298 --> 00:18:55,423
AND POPPY BE LIKE, UH -- KEEP
GOING, PLAYBOY.

237
00:18:56,191 --> 00:18:59,916
FACE

238
00:19:06,702 --> 00:19:09,552
I'VE BEEN IN TROUBLE IN MY DAY.

239
00:19:09,552 --> 00:19:11,399
I'VE BEEN IN A LOT OF TROUBLE IN
MY DAY.

240
00:19:11,399 --> 00:19:13,302
MAN, LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING,
THIS GUY PUFFY,

241
00:19:13,302 --> 00:19:17,705
THIS GUY'S IN AN
ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF TROUBLE.

242
00:19:18,356 --> 00:19:21,575
I DON'T THINK I'VE SEEN ANYTHING
LIKE THIS.

243
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:24,945
THEY GOT THIS GUY IN A RICO CASE

244
00:19:24,945 --> 00:19:27,348
BY HIMSELF.

245
00:19:36,037 --> 00:19:38,423
A LOT OF MY FRIENDS ASK ME,

246
00:19:38,423 --> 00:19:42,799
THEY SAY, DAVE, DID YOU KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT THOSE FREAKOFF PARTIES?

247
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:46,587
I BE LIKE, NO, MAN.

248
00:19:47,135 --> 00:19:49,540
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT
FREAKOFFS.

249
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:52,131
THEY ALL LOOK AT ME LIKE --

250
00:19:54,761 --> 00:19:57,562
THEY BE LIKE, HOW ARE ALL THESE
PEOPLE YOU KNOW WAS AT THE FREAKOFF,

251
00:19:57,562 --> 00:19:59,998
YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE
THAT WASN'T AT THE FREAKOFF?

252
00:19:59,998 --> 00:20:05,199
I THOUGHT ABOUT IT FOR A MINUTE.
I SAID, OH, MY GOD.

253
00:20:06,384 --> 00:20:08,730
I'M UGLY.

254
00:20:11,476 --> 00:20:13,657
BOY.

255
00:20:13,957 --> 00:20:17,957
THAT IS A TOUGH WAY TO FIND THAT
OUT.

256
00:20:18,463 --> 00:20:21,286
CAN YOU IMAGINE, YOU AND ME
READING THE NEWSPAPER

257
00:20:21,286 --> 00:20:25,882
AND FOUND
OUT EVERYONE IN HOLLYWOOD HAD AN
ORGY BEHIND YOUR BACK?

258
00:20:25,882 --> 00:20:28,824
LIKE, NONE OF Y'ALL CALLED ME?

259
00:20:29,512 --> 00:20:31,915
BOY, THAT REALLY HURTS.

260
00:20:31,915 --> 00:20:33,616
I'M GLAD THEY DIDN'T CALL ME,
THOUGH.

261
00:20:33,616 --> 00:20:35,864
BECAUSE THE STORIES COMING OUT
ABOUT IT ARE CRAZY.

262
00:20:35,864 --> 00:20:37,689
I SAW ONE THING ON THE INTERNET.

263
00:20:37,689 --> 00:20:39,483
SO I'M NOT SURE THIS IS TRUE.

264
00:20:39,483 --> 00:20:41,938
PROBABLY DOUBT IT'S TRUE.
BUT I SAW IT.

265
00:20:41,938 --> 00:20:45,977
SOME GUY WHO SAID HE DO PUFFY
LIKE, YEAH, MAN, HE WAS LIKE, I
WAS AT THE FREAKOFF,

266
00:20:45,977 --> 00:20:51,607
I WENT IN
THE BACK ROOM, PUFF WAS IN THERE
WITH THE GUY FROM "FAMILY MATTERS,"

267
00:20:51,607 --> 00:20:54,778
HE WAS SMASHING.
I WAS LIKE, PUFF, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING?

268
00:20:54,778 --> 00:20:59,187
HE WAS LIKE, YEAH, FEELS GOOD TO
MAKE ANOTHER MAN DO YOUR
BIDDING.

269
00:20:59,187 --> 00:21:01,999
AND I WAS LIKE, OH, MY GOD.

270
00:21:02,682 --> 00:21:06,216
KARL WINSLOW FROM "FAMILY
MATTERS" WAS THERE,

271
00:21:06,216 --> 00:21:08,916
AND I WASN'T
INVITED?

272
00:21:15,794 --> 00:21:18,646
WORSE THAN I THOUGHT.

273
00:21:19,885 --> 00:21:22,994
OR -- OR MAYBE I'M NOT UGLY.

274
00:21:22,994 --> 00:21:25,491
YOU KNOW.
LOOK.
LOOK AT MY FACE.

275
00:21:25,491 --> 00:21:28,021
THIS IS NOT NECESSARILY A
HANDSOME FACE.

276
00:21:28,021 --> 00:21:30,173
BUT IT'S NOT AN UGLY FACE.

277
00:21:30,173 --> 00:21:34,780
BUT IF YOU REALLY STUDY MY FACE
CLEARLY, CLEARLY

278
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:38,101
I HAVE SNITCH
ENERGY.

279
00:21:41,233 --> 00:21:43,651
OH, I LOOK LIKE I'LL TELL.

280
00:21:43,651 --> 00:21:48,159
THE LAST THING YOU WANT TO SEE
AT AN ORGY IS ME ACROSS THE ROOM
LOOKING AT YOU LIKE --

281
00:22:00,252 --> 00:22:03,835
LEAVE KARL WINSLOW ALONE!

282
00:22:10,292 --> 00:22:12,825
AMEN, AMEN.

283
00:22:12,825 --> 00:22:15,337
SO YOU WATCHING AT HOME, YOU
MIGHT NOT BE FAMOUS,

284
00:22:15,337 --> 00:22:17,939
BUT I BET
YOU AIN'T PERFECT.
NOBODY IS PERFECT.

285
00:22:17,939 --> 00:22:20,097
THE IDEA IS THAT YOU LIVE YOUR LIFE

286
00:22:20,097 --> 00:22:23,505
AND GROW PAST YOUR
MISTAKES.

287
00:22:23,505 --> 00:22:26,159
BUT IF YOU GET TO BE 55 --

288
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:28,661
AND PUFFY IS 55.

289
00:22:28,661 --> 00:22:33,422
HE DOESN'T LOOK OLD, BUT HE'S
PAYING HALF PRICE AT THE MOVIES.

290
00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:39,464
I SEE YOU, PLAYBOY.

291
00:22:40,662 --> 00:22:44,119
AIN'T NOTHING WRONG GETTING
OLDER, BUT IF YOU 55

292
00:22:44,119 --> 00:22:48,990
AND YOU GOT
A THOUSAND BOTTLES OF BABY OIL
IN THE HOUSE,

293
00:22:48,990 --> 00:22:53,450
CLEARLY YOU CAN'T
STOP, DON'T STOP.

294
00:22:53,450 --> 00:22:56,090
YOU COMMITTED TO THE LIFESTYLE.

295
00:22:56,090 --> 00:22:59,230
BECAUSE I'M 51.
AND I'M TELLING YOU, THIS IS
TRUE.

296
00:22:59,230 --> 00:23:01,698
I CAN'T REMEMBER A SINGLE TIME

297
00:23:01,698 --> 00:23:05,355
I EVER THREW AN EMPTY BOTTLE OF
BABY OIL IN THE TRASH.

298
00:23:07,857 --> 00:23:12,009
I DON'T THINK I'VE EVER FINISHED
A BOTTLE OF BABY OIL IN MY LIFE.

299
00:23:12,009 --> 00:23:16,697
IF WE WENT TO MY MOTHER'S HOUSE
TONIGHT, SHE'D PROBABLY HAVE THE
SAME BABY OIL WE HAD

300
00:23:16,697 --> 00:23:18,557
WHEN I WAS
A LITTLE BOY WITH A TANK TOP,

301
00:23:18,557 --> 00:23:21,616
AND SOMEHOW PUFFY WAS ALL THE
WAY DOWN TO THE LAST.

302
00:23:26,243 --> 00:23:29,376
AND HAVING BABY OIL IS NOT
ILLEGAL.

303
00:23:29,376 --> 00:23:31,463
THEY DON'T REMIND YOU ABOUT THAT
PART.

304
00:23:31,463 --> 00:23:33,946
THAT'S THE LEAST HARMFUL THING I
READ.

305
00:23:33,946 --> 00:23:35,883
HE WAS THE WRONG LUBE, I THINK.

306
00:23:35,883 --> 00:23:38,871
IF HE USED CRISCO, HE WOULD HAVE
GOT AWAY FROM IT.

307
00:23:38,871 --> 00:23:42,287
THEY JUST KNOW HE LIKES TO COOK.

308
00:23:49,218 --> 00:23:51,250
THANKS.

309
00:24:02,638 --> 00:24:05,648
THANK GOD THEY CAUGHT HIM BEFORE
THOSE FIRES.

310
00:24:05,648 --> 00:24:08,513
GODDAMN MUSHROOM CLOUD OVER HIS
HOUSE.

311
00:24:08,513 --> 00:24:11,852
A THOUSAND BOTTLES OF BABY OIL
IN THERE.

312
00:24:19,183 --> 00:24:21,300
HERE'S THE THING.

313
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:25,334
ON MONDAY, DONALD TRUMP'S COMING
BACK.

314
00:24:25,334 --> 00:24:29,195
HE'LL BE THE 47th PRESIDENT.
HE'S DONE IT AGAIN.

315
00:24:29,195 --> 00:24:33,496
AND ALL THE FLAGS WILL BE AT
HALF STAFF BECAUSE JIMMY CARTER
DIED.

316
00:24:33,496 --> 00:24:36,625
JIMMY CARTER, GO BACK AND FORTH

317
00:24:36,625 --> 00:24:38,760
AND SAY HE WAS A BAD PRESIDENT
OR A GOOD PRESIDENT.

318
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:43,524
I'M NOT QUALIFIED TO SPEAK ON
THAT.
BUT I'LL TELL YOU THIS.

319
00:24:43,524 --> 00:24:46,938
I WAS IN THE MIDDLE EAST YEARS
AGO AFTER I QUIT MY SHOW.

320
00:24:46,938 --> 00:24:49,286
I WAS TRYING TO FIND OUT WHAT I
WANTED TO DO WITH MY LIFE.

321
00:24:49,286 --> 00:24:53,792
WHILE I WAS THERE, JIMMY CARTER
FLEW TO ISRAEL.

322
00:24:53,913 --> 00:24:57,438
SO EVERYBODY IN THE REGION WAS
TALKING ABOUT A FORMER AMERICAN
PRESIDENT.

323
00:24:57,438 --> 00:24:59,847
BEING IN THE MIDDLE EAST.

324
00:24:59,847 --> 00:25:03,838
AND WHILE HE WAS IN ISRAEL, A
BOOK OF HIS WAS RELEASED,

325
00:25:03,838 --> 00:25:07,083
AND
ITS TITLE WAS VERY CONTROVERSIAL
IN ISRAEL.

326
00:25:07,083 --> 00:25:12,543
AND THE TITLE OF THE BOOK WAS
"PALESTINE: PEACE, NOT"
APARTHEID."

327
00:25:12,543 --> 00:25:14,596
PEOPLE WERE VERY MAD IN ISRAEL.

328
00:25:14,596 --> 00:25:17,963
THERE WAS A LOT OF MEAN STORIES
THAT CAME OUT IN THE PAPER.
SOME PEOPLE WERE SUPPORTIVE.

329
00:25:17,963 --> 00:25:20,686
WHILE HE WAS THERE,

330
00:25:20,686 --> 00:25:24,212
JIMMY CARTER
SAID, I WANT TO GO TO THE
PALESTINIAN TERRITORY,

331
00:25:24,212 --> 00:25:26,710
AND THE
ISRAELI GOVERNMENT SAID, IT'S
TOO DANGEROUS,

332
00:25:26,710 --> 00:25:31,131
AND IF YOU GO, WE
CANNOT PROTECT YOU.

333
00:25:31,131 --> 00:25:34,286
AND THEN JIMMY CARTER WENT
ANYWAY.

334
00:25:34,286 --> 00:25:37,872
I WILL NEVER FORGET THE IMAGES
OF A FORMER AMERICAN PRESIDENT

335
00:25:37,872 --> 00:25:39,868
WALKING WITH LITTLE TO NO SECURITY

336
00:25:39,868 --> 00:25:42,173
WHILE THOUSANDS OF
PALESTINIANS WERE CHEERING HIM
ON.

337
00:25:42,173 --> 00:25:45,737
WHEN I SAW THAT PICTURE, IT
BROUGHT TEARS TO MY EYES.

338
00:25:45,737 --> 00:25:48,467
I SAID, I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S A
GOOD PRESIDENT,

339
00:25:48,467 --> 00:25:51,857
BUT THAT RIGHT
THERE, I AM SURE,

340
00:25:51,857 --> 00:25:53,556
IS A GREAT
MAN.

341
00:25:53,556 --> 00:25:57,754
IT MADE ME FEEL VERY PROUD.

342
00:26:04,987 --> 00:26:09,388
THE PRESIDENCY IS NO PLACE FOR
PETTY PEOPLE.

343
00:26:09,388 --> 00:26:14,095
SO DONALD TRUMP, I KNOW YOU
WATCH THE SHOW.

344
00:26:16,732 --> 00:26:20,387
MAN, REMEMBER, WHETHER PEOPLE
VOTED FOR YOU OR NOT,

345
00:26:20,387 --> 00:26:22,469
THEY'RE
ALL COUNTING ON YOU.

346
00:26:22,469 --> 00:26:27,390
WHETHER THEY LIKE YOU OR NOT,
THEY'RE ALL COUNTING ON YOU.

347
00:26:27,390 --> 00:26:29,437
THE WHOLE WORLD IS COUNTING ON
YOU.

348
00:26:29,437 --> 00:26:32,121
I MEAN THIS WHEN I SAY THIS.
GOOD LUCK.

349
00:26:32,121 --> 00:26:34,740
PLEASE, DO BETTER NEXT TIME.

350
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:38,587
PLEASE, ALL OF US, DO BETTER
NEXT TIME.

351
00:26:38,587 --> 00:26:40,774
DO NOT FORGET YOUR HUMANITY,

352
00:26:40,774 --> 00:26:43,866
AND PLEASE HAVE EMPATHY FOR
DISPLACED PEOPLE,

353
00:26:43,866 --> 00:26:47,560
WHETHER
THEY'RE IN THE PALISADES OR
PALESTINE.

354
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:50,904

HE GOT ADDICTED TO PORNOGRAPHY.

456
00:30:56,055 --> 00:30:57,654
A BLACK LIGHT IN HIS ROOM, IT

457
00:30:57,656 --> 00:30:58,889
WOULD LOOK LIKE A CRIME SCENE

458
00:30:58,891 --> 00:31:01,091
FROM A "CSI" EPISODE.

459
00:31:01,093 --> 00:31:03,660

I SHOOT HIM WITH A GUN.

465
00:31:14,707 --> 00:31:15,806
HE NEED TO SHOW RESPECT BECAUSE

466
00:31:15,808 --> 00:31:16,506
MY BALLS USED TO BE HIS HOUSE.

467
00:31:25,584 --> 00:31:28,051
>> WELL -- I'LL HAVE YOU KNOW MY

468
00:31:28,053 --> 00:31:30,287
SON DOES RESPECT ME, BECAUSE I

469

RESPECT HIM.

470
00:31:31,023 --> 00:31:32,155

>> OKAY, PLEASE DO NOT TOUCH ME

1148
00:53:59,120 --> 00:54:01,553
WITH YOUR COLD, SLIMY FINGERS.

1149
00:54:01,555 --> 00:54:03,422
>> SAID YOUR FORMER ASSISTANT.

1150
00:54:07,461 --> 00:54:09,094
NO, I'M KIDDING, I'M KIDDING.

1151
00:54:09,096 --> 00:54:11,397
I REALLY LIKED THE MOVIE.

1152
00:54:11,399 --> 00:54:12,631
ALTHOUGH IT WOULD HAVE BEEN NICE

1153
00:54:12,633 --> 00:54:15,000

00:54:19,940 --> 00:54:22,241
JEALOUS OF NEW NOSFERATU.

1159
00:54:22,243 --> 00:54:24,076
>> JEALOUS OF WHAT, COLIN?

1160
00:54:24,078 --> 00:54:26,979
HE DOESN'T EVEN LOOK LIKE ME,

1161
00:54:26,981 --> 00:54:27,346
NOSFERATU.

1162
00:54:27,348 --> 00:54:29,048
THE GUY IS LIKE JACKED AND HAS

1163
00:54:29,050 --> 00:54:30,182
LIKE A MOUSTACHE.

1164
00:54:30,184 --> 00:54:32,217
HE LOOKS LIKE SHIRTLESS NED

1165
00:54:32,219 --> 00:54:32,584
FLANDERS.

1166
00:54:37,591 --> 00:54:40,459
LIKE, HOW DID HE EVEN GET SO

1167
00:54:40,461 --> 00:54:41,427
SWOLE?

00:54:41,429 --> 00:54:43,128
VAMPIRES ONLY DO ONE SITUP A

00:54:43,130 --> 00:54:45,798
DAY, AND IT'S LIKE THIS, COLIN.

REALLY, VERY, VERY IMPRESSIVE.

1173
00:55:04,085 --> 00:55:05,184
YEAH, I THINK YOU MIGHT JUST BE

1174
00:55:05,186 --> 00:55:08,454
A LITTLE JEALOUS OF THE NEW

1175
00:55:08,456 --> 00:55:09,655
NOSFERATU BECAUSE YOU CAN BARELY

1176
00:55:09,657 --> 00:55:11,790
DO ONE SITUP AND YOU CAN'T GROW

1177
00:55:11,792 --> 00:55:12,224
FACIAL HAIR.

1178
00:55:12,226 --> 00:55:13,792
>> COLIN, YOU CAN'T GROW A

1179
00:55:13,794 --> 00:55:14,326
MOUSTACHE EITHER.

1180
00:55:14,328 --> 00:55:15,861
>> OKAY, STOP, YOU'RE GOING TO

1181
00:55:15,863 --> 00:55:17,596
GIVE ME A NOSEBLEED.

1182
00:55:17,598 --> 00:55:19,198
THE LAST THING I NEED IS YOU

1183
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:19,798
SUCKING ON YOUR NOSE.

1184

00:55:21,268 --> 00:55:21,600
REALLY?

1186
00:55:21,602 --> 00:55:22,468
NO THANKS, I DON'T WANT TO BE UP

1187
00:55:22,470 --> 00:55:23,769

1188
00:55:28,209 --> 00:55:29,508

00:55:43,657 --> 00:55:47,192
>> OKAY, DON'T ENCOURAGE HIM.

1195
00:55:47,194 --> 00:55:48,727
YOU SEEM REALLY AMPED UP

1196
00:55:48,729 --> 00:55:49,094

1197
00:55:49,096 --> 00:55:50,429
>> I NEED TO SUCK SOME BLOOD.

1198
00:55:50,431 --> 00:55:53,699
I'M THIRSTY, COLIN.

1199

1286
00:59:40,978 --> 00:59:44,446
SHE GOT A BEAUTIFUL SOUL.

1309
01:00:33,163 --> 01:00:33,462
