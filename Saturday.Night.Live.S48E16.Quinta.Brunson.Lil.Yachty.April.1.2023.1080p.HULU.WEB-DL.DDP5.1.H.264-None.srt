>> Announcer: AND NOW, A MESSAGE
FROM FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP.

2
00:00:07,341 --> 00:00:10,262
>>> HELLO.
THANK YOU.

3
00:00:10,262 --> 00:00:11,449
IT'S ME.
HI.

4
00:00:11,449 --> 00:00:14,183
I'M THE PROBLEM.
IT'S ME.

5
00:00:14,183 --> 00:00:17,280
WELL, FOLKS, IT HAPPENED. I GOT INDICTED,

6
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:19,795
OR AS I SPELL
IT, INDICATED.

7
00:00:19,795 --> 00:00:23,638
AND FRANKLY, IT'S TIME THAT I COME CLEAN,

8
00:00:23,638 --> 00:00:28,258
ADMIT THAT I BROKE
THE LAW, AND GO QUIETLY TO
PRISON.

9
00:00:28,258 --> 00:00:30,631
APRIL FOOLS!

10
00:00:30,631 --> 00:00:32,818
THAT WAS A PRANK.

11
00:00:32,919 --> 00:00:36,060
I WAS DOING A JIM FROM OFFICE.

12
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:40,826
BUT MAKE NO MISTAKE, WHAT THE
RADICAL LEFT DEMOCRATS ARE DOING TO ME

13
00:00:40,826 --> 00:00:44,024
IS WORSE THAN ANY CRIME
I'VE EVER COMMITTED,

14
00:00:44,024 --> 00:00:45,744
AND I'VE COMMITTED A LOT,

15
00:00:45,744 --> 00:00:47,891
CLOSE TO 34.

16
00:00:47,891 --> 00:00:52,376
SOME ARE SAY I'M GOING TO USE
THIS INDICTMENT TO RILE UP MY BASE

17
00:00:52,376 --> 00:00:54,667
SO THAT THEY GIVE ME MORE
MONEY.

18
00:00:54,667 --> 00:00:56,205
NOT TRUE.
NOT TRUE.

19
00:00:56,205 --> 00:00:59,626
I DON'T WANT ANYTHING FROM MY
BASE EXCEPT THEIR LOVE, THEIR VOTES,

20
00:00:59,626 --> 00:01:01,103
PERHAPS THEIR MONEY.

21
00:01:01,103 --> 00:01:04,199
AND I NEED THEIR MONEY MORE THAN
EVER.

22
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:07,832
NOW YOU MAY HAVE SEEN I'VE BEEN
OPENING MY RALLIES

23
00:01:07,832 --> 00:01:11,159

WONDERFUL SONG, "JUSTICE FOR ALL"

24
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:13,719
WHICH I PERFORMED WITH THE
J-6 CHOIR.

25
00:01:13,719 --> 00:01:17,515
THAT'S A REAL THING.
VERY DISTURBING.

LIAM.

29
00:01:27,459 --> 00:01:32,111

BECAUSE YOU'RE A GREAT MOM BUT
BECAUSE YOU ARE A TEACHER.

149
00:11:15,596 --> 00:11:19,108
MOST IMPORTANT JOB THERE IS.

150
00:11:22,404 --> 00:11:25,796
>> AS MY FRIEND BARACK SAID --

151
00:11:25,796 --> 00:11:28,423
I CALL HIM BARACK NOW.

152
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:31,993
MY MOM REALLY WAS AN AMAZING
TEACHER, AND I'M SO PROUD OF
HER.

153
00:11:32,059 --> 00:11:35,900
BUT I ALSO NO FIRSTHAND THAT
TEACHERS GET TAKEN FOR GRANTED.

154
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:38,340
LIKE I'VE ALWAYS HAD A
DISHWASHER.

155
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:41,857
NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT IT, LOADED
IT UP, KICKED IT SHUT, WENT TO
BED WASTED.

156
00:11:41,857 --> 00:11:47,481
BUT THEN MY HUSBAND AND I MOVED
INTO AN APARTMENT THAT DIDN'T HAVE A DISHWASHER,

157
00:11:47,481 --> 00:11:51,446
AND AFTER ONE
DAY, I WAS LIKE, WE GOT TO GET
THE HELL OUT OF HERE.

158
00:11:51,446 --> 00:11:54,862
THAT'S HOW PARENTS FEEL

159
00:11:54,862 --> 00:11:57,577
WHEN THEY DON'T HAVE A TEACHER DURING
THE PANDEMIC.

160
00:11:57,577 --> 00:12:01,366
SUDDENLY PARENTS ARE LIKE, WE
HAVE TO TEACH THESE DISHES NOW?

161
00:12:01,366 --> 00:12:03,689
FEED THESE DISHES NOW?

162
00:12:03,794 --> 00:12:05,664
WHY DID I HAVE SO MANY DISHES?

163
00:12:05,664 --> 00:12:08,397
THAT LAST DISH WAS A MISTAKE.

164
00:12:08,397 --> 00:12:12,551
SERIOUSLY, TEACHERS ARE PEOPLE,
NOT APPLIANCES.

165
00:12:12,551 --> 00:12:15,708
SO PLEASE, REMEMBER HOW
IMPORTANT TEACHERS ARE.

166
00:12:15,708 --> 00:12:18,008
ACKNOWLEDGE THE WORK THEY DO EVERY DAY,

167
00:12:18,008 --> 00:12:21,822
AND FOR THE LOVE OF
GOD, PAY THEM THE MONEY THEY
DESERVE.

168
00:12:21,822 --> 00:12:25,901
WE GOT A GREATHOW FOR YOU
TONIGHT.
LIL YACHTY

169
00:12:25,901 --> 00:12:29,458
STICK

170
00:12:41,726 --> 00:12:44,794
>>> DUDE, I THOUGHT THIS CLUB

171
00:12:44,796 --> 00:12:47,597
WAS A LITTLE SKETCHY AT FIRST,

172
00:12:47,599 --> 00:12:48,498
BUT THE GIRLS HERE ARE INSANE.

173
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:49,799
>> I KNOW.

174
00:12:49,801 --> 00:12:51,534
I ALREADY GOT LIKE THREE PHONE

175
00:12:51,536 --> 00:12:51,901
NUMBERS.

176
00:12:51,903 --> 00:12:54,637
>> THE ONLY THING THAT WOULD

177
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:55,738
MAKE THIS NIGHT MORE PERFECT IS

178
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:57,173
IF WE COULD SCORE A LITTLE

179
00:12:57,175 --> 00:12:57,574
SOMETHING.

180
00:12:57,576 --> 00:12:58,374
>> YOU MEAN LIKE COKE?

181
00:12:58,376 --> 00:12:59,843
>> YEAH, MAN.

182
00:12:59,845 --> 00:13:00,343
>> I DON'T KNOW.

183
00:13:00,345 --> 00:13:01,878
>> WHY NOT?

184
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:04,214
WE'RE ON VACATION, RIGHT?

185
00:13:04,216 --> 00:13:05,181
>> ALL RIGHT.

186
00:13:05,183 --> 00:13:06,449
AS LONG AS WE CAN FIND SOMETHING

187
00:13:06,451 --> 00:13:07,050
THAT'S PURE.

188
00:13:07,052 --> 00:13:10,286
THERE'S A LOT OF GARBAGE GOING

189
00:13:10,288 --> 00:13:10,820
AROUND RIGHT NOW.

190
00:13:10,822 --> 00:13:11,154

BECAUSE I CAN MAKE THAT HAPPEN.

197
00:13:19,531 --> 00:13:20,563

>> I WOULD HAVE TO SAY GET ON
TOP.

477
00:23:14,639 --> 00:23:19,483
>> OKAY.
AND JOHN SAID --

478
00:23:19,483 --> 00:23:21,690
>> HOG THE SHEETS, BABE.

479
00:23:21,690 --> 00:23:25,809
>> ONCE AGAIN, THE CRONINS ARE
NOT REMOTELY ON THE SAME PAGE.

480
00:23:25,809 --> 00:23:28,014
NEXT QUESTION FOR THE ANDERSONS.

481
00:23:28,014 --> 00:23:30,654
WHAT WAS YOUR BIGGEST FIGHT
ABOUT?

482
00:23:30,654 --> 00:23:34,634
>> OH, I KNOW THIS ONE.
THAT WOULD BE THE BASKETBALL
GAME INCIDENT.

483
00:23:34,634 --> 00:23:38,672
>> OKAY.
THOMAS SAYS THE BASKETBALL GAME
INCIDENT, AND MIA SAYS --

484
00:23:38,672 --> 00:23:42,184
THE
TIME I HIT A HALF COURT SHOT AT
A BASKETBALL GAME

485
00:23:42,184 --> 00:23:44,934
AND THEY GAVE
ME FREE ROCK CLIMBING LESSONS FOR LIFE,

486
00:23:44,934 --> 00:23:49,477
AND YOU RAN AND
RIPPED UP THE CERTIFICATE IN
FRONT OF THE WHOLE STADIUM.

487
00:23:50,202 --> 00:23:52,707
FIVE POINTS FOR THE ANDERSONS.

488
00:23:52,707 --> 00:23:55,872
>> WE RUNNINGY IT NOW,
HUH, BABY?

489
00:23:55,872 --> 00:23:59,671
>> THAT SOUND MEANS IT'S TIME
FOR A BONUS QUESTION.

490
00:23:59,671 --> 00:24:00,835
MIA

491
00:24:00,835 --> 00:24:03,993
WHO HAS HAD THE BIGGEST
INFLUENCE ON YOUR HUSBAND'S
LIFE?

492
00:24:03,993 --> 00:24:05,954
>> HIS FATHER.

493
00:24:05,954 --> 00:24:08,795
>> YEP.
MY DAD.

494
00:24:08,795 --> 00:24:12,071
MY PARENTS ARE ACTUALLY HERE
TODAY.
HOW AM I DOING, DAD?

495
00:24:12,071 --> 00:24:14,696
>> YOU'RE DOING GREAT, SON.

496
00:24:23,837 --> 00:24:26,018
>> BACK TO LINDA.

497
00:24:26,018 --> 00:24:29,918
WHAT IS YOUR HUSBAND'S DREAM
VACATION?

498
00:24:30,127 --> 00:24:32,501
>> I DON'T KNOW.
SNEAK WORLD

499
00:24:32,501 --> 00:24:35,266
>> YEAH.RLD?
WORLD.

500
00:24:35,266 --> 00:24:38,278
NO, YOU IDIOT.
I JUST SAID I DON'T LIKE SNAKES.

501
00:24:38,278 --> 00:24:42,114
>> OOH, CALLING YOUR SPOUSE AN
IDIOT AND LOSE A TURN.

502
00:24:42,114 --> 00:24:45,314
ALL RIGHT.
MIA, WHAT'S YOUR HUSBAND'S DREAM
VACATION.

503
00:24:45,314 --> 00:24:49,510
>> AT THIS POINT, WHO KNOWS, BUT
HE ALWAYS SAID ARUBA.

504
00:24:49,510 --> 00:24:51,927
>> YES.
YES, BABY.

505
00:24:51,927 --> 00:24:55,324
>> FINALLY.
THERE'S THE MAN I MARRIED.

506
00:24:55,324 --> 00:24:58,510
>> UH-HUH.
AND WHAT'S THAT LITTLE ASHTRAY?

507
00:24:58,510 --> 00:25:01,651
>> OH, THAT'S JUST THIS.

508
00:25:01,651 --> 00:25:04,434
>> AS LONG AS YOU'RE STILL
HEALTHY.

509
00:25:04,509 --> 00:25:07,630
IF NOT, THEN BIG SUR WITH YOUR
SISTER.

510
00:25:07,630 --> 00:25:10,072
AFTER YEARS OF CARING FOR YOU TOGETHER,

511
00:25:10,072 --> 00:25:13,250
WE WILL HAVE GROWN

00:25:16,783 --> 00:25:19,101
WE'LL HOLD EACH OTHER AND WEEP,

514
00:25:19,101 --> 00:25:22,287
NOT JUST BECAUSE THE
PLEASURE IS SO INTENSE

515
00:25:22,287 --> 00:25:26,868
BUT
BECAUSE WE FINALLY FEEL RELIEF
FROM OUR TRAGICALLY SHARED
BURDEN.

516
00:25:28,134 --> 00:25:33,522
WELL, YOU BOTH SAID ARUBA, THAT
FIVE POINTS PUTS YOU OVER THE

522
00:26:26,901 --> 00:26:37,511
>> OH, MY GOD, DAD, DON'T BE SO

523
00:26:37,513 --> 00:26:37,878
AWKWARD.

524

GOOD EVENING, EVERYONE.

I'M MICHAEL CHE.

GREAT NEWS

691
00:36:31,723 --> 00:36:34,763
NEW YORK IS FINALLY CRACKING
DOWN ON CRIME.

692
00:36:34,763 --> 00:36:37,681
FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP
WAS INDICTED IN HIS ROLE

693
00:36:37,681 --> 00:36:40,988
IN
PAYING HUSH MONEY TO STORMY DANIELS,

694
00:36:40,988 --> 00:36:43,932
AND THE TRIAL WILL BE
LIKE A STORMY DANIELS MOVIE,

695
00:36:43,932 --> 00:36:47,708
BECAUSE I'M DEEPLY ASHAMED AT
HOW EXCITED I AM TO WATCH IT.

696
00:36:47,709 --> 00:36:49,946
NEXT WEEK

697
00:36:49,946 --> 00:36:55,155
BUT HIS LAWYER, JOE TACOPINA, WHO HE CALLED
JOE TAPIOCA

698
00:36:55,155 --> 00:36:58,188
SAID HE WILL NOT BE PUT IN HAND CUFFS,

699
00:36:58,188 --> 00:37:03,657
THOUGH HE
WILL WEAR BARACK AWAY HAND CUFF
AND A SUPERMAN T-SHIRT.

700
00:37:03,658 --> 00:37:07,579
POLICE
MUG SHOT

701
00:37:07,579 --> 00:37:10,388
CARES GETTING RIGHT

702
00:37:10,388 --> 00:37:13,641
I'M SURE HE'S HOPING HIS MUG
SHOT WILL LOOK COOL LIKE FRANK
SINATRA'S.

703
00:37:13,641 --> 00:37:17,803
NICK NOLTE

704
00:37:18,817 --> 00:37:23,180
>> TRUMP WILL BE ALSO CHARGED
WITH 34 COUNTS OF BUSINESS FRAUD.

COSTUME

706
00:37:29,450 --> 00:37:34,526
PRESIDENT BIDEN ON FRIDAY TOLD
REPORTERS HE HAD OMME
TRUMP'S INDICTMENT,

707
00:37:34,526 --> 00:37:38,301
ANDHEN HE
DANCED AWAY LILAGS GUY.

708
00:37:43,986 --> 00:37:47,767
>> I THINK IN GENERAL, THE
PEOPLE MIGHT BE OVERREACTING TO
THIS INDICTMENT.

709
00:37:47,767 --> 00:37:50,250
LIKE AN ACTUAL HEADLINE ON CNN
YESTERDAY WAS

710
00:37:50,250 --> 00:37:53,348
NOTHING IN
AMERICAN HISTORY APPROACHES THE TUMULT

711
00:37:53,348 --> 00:37:57,096
CHARGES AND POSSIBLE TRIAL AND
CONVICTION OF A FORMER
PRESIDENT.

712
00:37:57,096 --> 00:37:59,022
A MORE ACCURATE HEADLINE WOULD BE,

713
00:37:59,022 --> 00:38:02,073
MAN WE ALL KNEW WAS CRIMINAL
IS CRIMINAL.

714
00:38:02,155 --> 00:38:05,422
PRO TRUMP

715
00:38:05,422 --> 00:38:09,162
I WENT DOWN TO THE COURTHOUSE
TODAY, AND I WAS THE ONLY
PROTESTOR THERE.

716
00:38:09,162 --> 00:38:10,040
LET GO

717
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:12,083
STINK

718
00:38:16,116 --> 00:38:19,892
>> I TOLD THEM NOT TO LAUGH AT
YOU.

719
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:35,660
>> AM I NOT MICCED?

720
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:39,613
THEN I WAS LIKE, OH, I JUST
SUCK.

721
00:38:39,613 --> 00:38:42,437
>> MOVING RIGHT ALONG --

722
00:38:42,340 --> 00:38:47,120
>> MARJORIE TAYLOR GREEN
>> YOU'RE EVIL.

723
00:38:47,346 --> 00:38:51,886
PLANS
TO COME TO NEW YORK ON TUESDAY
TO PROTEST TRUMP'S INDICTMENT,

724
00:38:51,886 --> 00:38:56,664
BECAUSE APPARENTLY IT TAKES HER
THREE DAYS TO PUT ON HER JOKER
MAKEUP.

725
00:38:57,683 --> 00:39:00,909
THEY'LL PROBABLY LAUGH AT THIS
NEXT ONE.

726
00:39:02,726 --> 00:39:06,197
>> THAT'S THE MEANEST THING
YOU'VE EVER DONE TO ME.

727
00:39:07,336 --> 00:39:10,788
I'M COVERED IN SWEAT.

728
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:20,142
DON'T EVEN DARE!

729
00:39:20,142 --> 00:39:23,302
DON'T YOU EVEN DARE TRY NOW.

730

FLORIDA GOVERNOR RON DeSANTIS

731

732

I'M SHAKING.

735
00:39:48,484 --> 00:39:51,269
RON DeSANTIS SAID FLORIDA OFFICIALS

736
00:39:51,269 --> 00:39:54,153
WOULD NOT HELP
EXTRADITE TRUMP BACK TO NEW YORK

737
00:39:54,153 --> 00:39:58,888
UNLESS OF COURSE HE AGREES TO
TAKE A BUS LOAD OF MIGRANTS WITH
HIM.

738
00:40:00,922 --> 00:40:03,783
>> IN THE WAKE OF THE NATIONAL
SHOOTING, PRESIDENT BIDEN

739
00:40:03,862 --> 00:40:07,231
ONCE
AGAIN CALLED ON CONGRESS TO PASS
AN ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN,

740
00:40:07,231 --> 00:40:11,296
OR, HEAR
ME OUT, STOP AND FRISK FOR
WHITES.

741
00:40:11,296 --> 00:40:15,227
HOW LONG BEFORE THESE KIDS EARN
A STEREO TYPE?

742
00:40:20,626 --> 00:40:25,531
>> CONGRESSMAN ANDY OGLES WHO
RESPECTS THE DISTRICT WHERE THE
NASHVILLE SHOOTING TOOK PLACE

743
00:40:25,531 --> 00:40:30,166
IS
BEING CRITICIZED FOR A CHRISTMAS
CARD WHERE HE AND HIS FAMILY ARE
HOLDING ASSAULT RIFLES.

744
00:40:30,166 --> 00:40:35,050
SHOOTINGS
WHO ARE YOU PSYCHOS SENDING
THESE CARDS TO?

745
00:40:35,050 --> 00:40:38,502
IF I RECEIVED THAT IN THE MAIL,
I WOULD MOVE.

746
00:40:38,502 --> 00:40:42,909
ALL THIS CARD TELLS YOU IS I AM
ARMED, I HAVE TERRIBLE JUDGMENT,

747
00:40:42,909 --> 00:40:45,140
AND I KNOW WHERE YOU LIVE.

748
00:40:45,467 --> 00:40:50,075
>> DEMOCRATIC REPRESENTATIVE
JAMAL BOWMAN AND THOMAS MASSEY

749
00:40:50,075 --> 00:40:52,507
GOT IN A SCREAMING MATCH ON CAPITOL HILL

750
00:40:52,507 --> 00:40:56,482
AFTER BOWMAN CALLED
THEM COWARDS FOR OPPOSING GUN
CONTROL.

751
00:40:56,482 --> 00:40:59,895
IF THERE'S ONE THING REPUBLICANS
HAVE,

752
00:40:59,895 --> 00:41:02,435
IT'S BIG OLD GUTS.

753

>> TRUMP HAS ALSO BEEN PROMOTING
A SONG CALLED JUSTICE FOR ALL,

754
00:41:07,932 --> 00:41:12,627
WHICH FEATURES HIMSELF AND A
CHOIR OF MEN JAILED FOR THEIR
ROLES IN THE JANUARY 6th ATTACK.

755
00:41:12,627 --> 00:41:16,857
I FEEL BAD FOR THE JANUARY 6th SINGERS
BECAUSE YOU KNOW JAIL GETS MUCH WORSE

756
00:41:16,857 --> 00:41:20,491
WHEN THE OTHER
PRISONERS FIND OUT YOU'RE IN AN
ACAPELLA GROUP.

WITH THIS FLORIDA CONTROVERSY?

776
00:42:19,237 --> 00:42:21,504

DIDN'T WANT THE KIDS TO SEE YOUR

PORNOGRAPHIC.

796
00:42:53,972 --> 00:42:54,737

00:48:55,233 --> 00:48:58,334
SAY I'M 5'9", WHICH MEANS I'M

972
00:48:58,336 --> 00:49:00,503
REALLY 5'7" 1/2, AND I'M LYING

973
00:49:00,505 --> 00:49:01,804
ABOUT THE HALF.

974
00:49:01,806 --> 00:49:03,806
WHAT HEIGHT DO YOU SAY, COLIN?

975
00:49:03,808 --> 00:49:04,940
>> I'M 6 FEET.

976
00:49:04,942 --> 00:49:07,176
>> SO YOU'RE 5'9"?

977
00:49:07,178 --> 00:49:08,778
>> NO, I'M 6 FEET.

978
00:49:08,780 --> 00:49:10,513
>> IF YOU WERE 6 FEET, YOU WOULD

979
00:49:10,515 --> 00:49:11,580
SAY 6'2".

980
00:49:11,582 --> 00:49:14,116
>> I'M EXACTLY 6 FEET.

981
00:49:14,118 --> 00:49:15,484
>> THEN LET'S STAND BACK TO

982
00:49:15,486 --> 00:49:15,785
BACK.

983
00:49:15,787 --> 00:49:16,852
>> I DON'T WANT TO DO THAT.

984
00:49:16,854 --> 00:49:18,454
>> INTERESTING.

985
00:49:18,456 --> 00:49:20,322
COLIN, SHORT INC. CANS LIKE US

986
00:49:20,324 --> 00:49:22,091
SHOULD BE PROUD OF OUR HERITAGE.

987
00:49:22,093 --> 00:49:24,293
WE COME FROM A LONG LINE OF

988
00:49:24,295 --> 00:49:28,097
GREATS, KEVIN HART, BRUNO MARS,

AGAIN, RIGHT THERE IN THE NAME.

994
00:49:43,181 --> 00:49:46,248
BEETHOVEN, THE COMPOSER, WAS

995
00:49:46,250 --> 00:49:48,150
5'6", AND THE DOG WAS EVEN

996
00:49:48,152 --> 00:49:48,517
SHORTER.

997
00:49:48,519 --> 00:49:49,018
>> GREAT TO KNOW.

998
00:49:49,020 --> 00:49:50,319
I THINK WE GET IT.

999
00:49:50,321 --> 00:49:53,422
>> NOW LET'S THINK OF SOME TALL

1000
00:49:53,424 --> 00:49:54,123

1001
00:49:54,125 --> 00:49:59,161

00:50:00,598 --> 00:50:03,199
>> ARMIE HAMMER IS NOT 7'3".

1004
00:50:03,201 --> 00:50:04,133
>> OKAY.

1005
00:50:04,135 --> 00:50:04,834
SORRY, I FORGOT YOU TWO WERE

1006
00:50:04,836 --> 00:50:06,869

>> WE'RE FRIENDLY.

1008
00:50:10,208 --> 00:50:11,741
>> YOU KNOW, THE WORST THING

1009
00:50:11,743 --> 00:50:14,243
ABOUT TALL MEN IS WHEN THEY SAY

1010
00:50:14,245 --> 00:50:17,646
HELLO TO US PETITE PRINCES.

1011
00:50:17,648 --> 00:50:20,049
THEY GO LOW AND USE A BABY

1012
00:50:20,051 --> 00:50:20,382
VOICE.

1013
00:50:20,384 --> 00:50:22,651
THEY GO, HEY, MAN, EVERYTHING

1014
00:50:22,653 --> 00:50:24,153

YOU, IT FEELS LIKE THEY SAY IT,

1017
00:50:27,925 --> 00:50:29,458

1018
00:50:29,460 --> 00:50:30,226
GO, ALL RIGHT, I GOT TO GO BACK

1019
00:50:30,228 --> 00:50:34,964

1020
00:50:34,966 --> 00:50:36,799
COLIN, WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY IS

1021
00:50:36,801 --> 00:50:39,568
US TINY TITANS, WE GOT TO

1026
00:50:43,508 --> 00:50:43,839
>> NO.

1027
00:50:43,841 --> 00:50:44,240
>> OKAY.

1028
00:50:44,242 --> 00:50:46,408
WELL, LOOK, SHORT KINGS, WE WERE

1029
00:50:46,410 --> 00:50:47,810
BORN KINGS.

1030
00:50:47,812 --> 00:50:48,978
WE'VE BECOME KINGS.

00:50:48,980 --> 00:50:49,979
WE'VE DONE THE WORK.

1032
00:50:49,981 --> 00:50:51,547
WE LEARNED HOW TO DANCE, NOT

1033
00:50:51,549 --> 00:50:55,885
BECAUSE WE WANTED TO BUT BECAUSE

1034
00:50:55,887 --> 00:50:56,952
WE HAD TO.

1035
00:50:56,954 --> 00:51:00,890
TALL GUYS LIKE MICHAEL CHE DON'T

1036
00:51:00,892 --> 00:51:02,158
GOT TO LEARN HOW TO DANCE.

1037
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:03,859

1038
00:51:03,861 --> 00:51:06,061

00:51:08,699 --> 00:51:10,366
NOT BECAUSE WE WANT TO BUT

1042
00:51:10,368 --> 00:51:11,734
BECAUSE WE HAD TO.

1043
00:51:11,736 --> 00:51:13,769
>> AGAIN, I'M 6 FEET TALL.

1044
00:51:13,771 --> 00:51:17,106

1045
00:51:17,108 --> 00:51:17,439
ANYWAY.

1046
00:51:17,441 --> 00:51:19,909
FOR ALL MY SHORT KINGS WATCHING

1047
00:51:19,911 --> 00:51:21,944

SO LET'S SHOW THEM, COLIN.

1051
00:51:27,084 --> 00:51:28,717

00:51:31,455 --> 00:51:31,754
THAT.

1055
00:51:31,756 --> 00:51:32,655

TWO WEEKS.

1068

1074
00:52:34,385 --> 00:52:35,351
I'M THE MIDWIFE.

1075
00:52:35,353 --> 00:52:41,957

00:52:57,675 --> 00:53:00,643
CENTIMETERS, WE'VE GOT TO MOVE

1084
00:53:00,645 --> 00:53:00,943
FAST.

00:53:08,819 --> 00:53:10,452
>> CAN YOU ASK HER ABOUT THIS

1091
00:53:10,454 --> 00:53:10,753
LATER?

1092
00:53:10,755 --> 00:53:13,489
>> FOR SURE.

1093
00:53:13,491 --> 00:53:16,058
IT WAS THE BARBECUE BEFORE THE

1094
00:53:16,060 --> 00:53:17,126
MACKLEMORE CONCERT?

1095
00:53:17,128 --> 00:53:20,429
>> SO WE MET IN 2012 ONE TIME?

1096
00:53:20,431 --> 00:53:22,097
I CAN'T DEAL WITH THIS ONE TIME?

1097
00:53:22,099 --> 00:53:23,666
>> REALLY?

1098
00:53:23,668 --> 00:53:26,035
HOW COME WHILE YOU WERE BEING

1099
00:53:26,037 --> 00:53:26,769
DEFENSIVE, I WAS DELIVERING THIS

1100
00:53:26,771 --> 00:53:35,978
BABY?

00:53:44,522 --> 00:53:45,854
>> THAT'S HIM.

1106
00:53:45,856 --> 00:53:46,255
THANK GOD.

1107
00:53:46,257 --> 00:53:48,257
>> BARRY, IT'S NICE TO SEE YOU

1108
00:53:48,259 --> 00:53:48,590
AGAIN.

1109
00:53:48,592 --> 00:53:49,491
>> AGAIN?

1110
00:53:49,493 --> 00:53:50,693
OH, HAVE WE MET?

1111
00:53:50,695 --> 00:53:52,861
>> ARE YOU SERIOUS?

1112
00:53:52,863 --> 00:53:53,862
>> YEAH.

1113
00:53:53,864 --> 00:53:55,631
NEVER SEEN YOU BEFORE IN MY

1114
00:53:55,633 --> 00:53:55,931
LIFE.

00:53:55,933 --> 00:53:57,032
>> I PROMISE YOU HAVE.

1116
00:53:57,034 --> 00:53:58,801
WE MET AT THIS HOSPITAL IN THIS

1117
00:53:58,803 --> 00:53:59,335
EXACT ROOM.

1118
00:53:59,337 --> 00:54:01,103
>> WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THIS?

1119
00:54:01,105 --> 00:54:03,472
TO EMBARRASS ME?

1120
00:54:03,474 --> 00:54:04,840
WE'VE NEVER MET.

1121
00:54:04,842 --> 00:54:05,474
GIRL, RESPECT YOURSELF.

1122
00:54:05,476 --> 00:54:06,408
>> WHAT'S GOING ON?

1123
00:54:06,410 --> 00:54:07,576
>> DON'T WORRY.

1124
00:54:07,578 --> 00:54:08,844
I'LL EXPLAIN.

1125
00:54:08,846 --> 00:54:10,379
BARRY IS PRETENDING NOT TO

1126
00:54:10,381 --> 00:54:14,717
REMEMBER DR. ROGERS BECAUSE

1127
00:54:14,719 --> 00:54:15,384
THREE YEARS AGO SHE DIDN'T

1128
00:54:15,386 --> 00:54:17,019
REMEMBER MEETING HIM AT A

1129
00:54:17,021 --> 00:54:17,386
BARBECUE.

1130
00:54:17,388 --> 00:54:21,590
>> BEFORE A MACKLEMORE CONCERT.

1131
00:54:21,592 --> 00:54:23,158
>> MACKLEMORE?

1132
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:25,894
YOU REALLY REMEMBER ME.

1133
00:54:25,896 --> 00:54:28,630
I'M CURIOUS AS TO WHY.

1134
00:54:28,632 --> 00:54:30,032
ANYWAY, WHILE YOU WERE BEING

1135
00:54:30,034 --> 00:54:31,000
DR. GASLIGHT, I WAS DELIVERING

1136
00:54:31,002 --> 00:54:36,839
THIS BABY.

1137

01:06:57,514 --> 01:06:58,279
MAYO AND BREAD.

1472
01:06:58,281 --> 01:07:00,215
>> HEY, THERE'S A LINE.

1473
01:07:00,217 --> 01:07:02,484
>> I GOT IT.

1474
01:07:02,486 --> 01:07:07,455
HEY, FORGET ABOUT --

1475
01:07:07,457 --> 01:07:09,357
>> MY FATHER IS A LAWYER!

1476
01:07:09,359 --> 01:07:11,893
>> CAN'T CUT THE LINE, MAN.

1477
01:07:11,895 --> 01:07:13,027
WE'VE BEEN WORKING ALL DAY.

1478
01:07:13,029 --> 01:07:15,363
>> WELL, I HOPE THE BUILDING

1479
01:07:15,365 --> 01:07:17,165
YOU'RE WORKING ON EXPLODES.

1480
01:07:17,167 --> 01:07:20,702
THEY HATED US THERE.

1481
01:07:20,704 --> 01:07:23,605
BUT AT LEAST WE HAVE FRIENDS IN

1482
01:07:23,607 --> 01:07:26,107
THAT FAKE JAMAICAN LADY.

1483
01:07:26,109 --> 01:07:26,641
SHE LOVED US.

1484
01:07:26,643 --> 01:07:29,277
>> I HATED THEM, BUT I READ THE

1485
01:07:29,279 --> 01:07:31,613
COMMENTS ON THEIR VIDEOS, AND NO

1486
01:07:31,615 --> 01:07:32,814
ONE SHOULD HAVE TO READ THAT

1487
01:07:32,816 --> 01:07:34,048
ABOUT THEMSELVES.

1488
01:07:34,050 --> 01:07:38,086
THE NICEST ONE I SAW SAID GAY

1489
01:07:38,088 --> 01:07:38,386
FAIL.

1490
01:07:38,388 --> 01:07:39,287
I MADE THEM SOME PLAIN ASS

1491
01:07:39,289 --> 01:07:41,422
CHICKEN, AND THEY LOVED IT.

1492
01:07:41,424 --> 01:07:42,824
>> AUTHENTIC JERK CHICKEN.

1493
01:07:42,826 --> 01:07:43,858
>> WHAT A BEAUTIFUL NEW YORK

1494
01:07:43,860 --> 01:07:44,159
DAY.

1495
01:07:44,161 --> 01:07:48,029
WE HAD SOME CHICKEN.

1496
01:07:48,031 --> 01:07:49,697
NO ONE CAN DO IT LIKE US.

1497
01:07:49,699 --> 01:08:11,085
>> NEW YORK!

1498
01:08:11,087 --> 01:08:12,620
AND THEIR INCREDIBLE BAND.

1499
01:08:12,622 --> 01:08:14,722
I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO MY

1500
01:08:14,724 --> 01:08:17,692

1502
01:08:20,197 --> 01:08:24,032

1503
01:08:24,034 --> 01:08:26,701
PANEL WITHOUT ME TODAY BECAUSE I

1504
01:08:26,703 --> 01:08:29,337
WAS HOSTING SNL.

1505
01:08:29,339 --> 01:08:31,973
I WANT TO THANK EVERYBODY AT

1506

01:08:42,986 --> 01:08:44,953
UNREAL, AND THEY DO IT EVERY

1515
01:08:44,955 --> 01:08:47,255
WEEK, AND IT'S NUTS, THE CAST,

1516
