1
00:00:03,853 --> 00:00:07,127
MAC:
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Guys, guys, guys,
guys, guys, guys.

2
00:00:07,127 --> 00:00:10,469
"Congratulations,
Paddy's Pub.
"We are pleased to report that
we are interested

3
00:00:10,469 --> 00:00:13,891
in featuring
"your bar on an upcoming
episode of our show.

4
00:00:13,891 --> 00:00:16,353
"We will be sending a producer
to do a walk-through soon.

5
00:00:16,353 --> 00:00:18,051
"Warmly, your friends at...

6
00:00:18,051 --> 00:00:21,286
Bar Rescue!"
Yes!

7
00:00:21,578 --> 00:00:23,563
This is like our dreams
come true, right?

8
00:00:23,563 --> 00:00:25,825
What?
To be on a reality TV show?

9
00:00:25,825 --> 00:00:27,110
Yeah. Wh--
How did this happen?

10
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:30,480
I've been writing them a letter
every week
since the show first started.

11
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:31,975
-Well, how long's it been?
-Too long.

12
00:00:31,975 --> 00:00:33,261
DEE: I very much do
want to be famous,

13
00:00:33,333 --> 00:00:36,553
but I don't know if I want to be
on a reality show
where they try and make us
look like jerks.

14
00:00:36,553 --> 00:00:39,341
-CHARLIE: Right.
Oh, right, yeah.
'Cause, like, what
if they, like, edit it

15
00:00:39,341 --> 00:00:40,866
to, like, make me
look stupid or something?

16
00:00:40,866 --> 00:00:42,940
Yeah. This is a definite pass
for me. I'm out.

17
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:45,477
This could be huge for us.
What are you guys talking about?

18
00:00:45,477 --> 00:00:47,536
I'm a little disappointed
that you didn't tell me earlier

19
00:00:47,536 --> 00:00:49,849
because I would have been
working out
for weeks in preparation.

20
00:00:49,849 --> 00:00:52,780
I mean, for God's sakes, man.
What if, what if
my shirt falls off?

21
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:54,849
Yeah, yeah. I'm a little off
my regimen, too.

22
00:00:54,851 --> 00:00:57,625
Like, I haven't even been doing any of my... workouts.
-Ever. He never has.

23
00:00:57,625 --> 00:01:00,257
You guys are missing
the bigger picture here.

24
00:01:00,291 --> 00:01:02,750
I mean, wh-what are the odds
that they would pick our bar?

25
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:06,875
This is a million-to-one shot,
and I've got a really good
feeling about this, guys.

26
00:01:06,875 --> 00:01:09,139
Things are about to change
here at Paddy's Pub

27
00:01:09,139 --> 00:01:12,241
because our luck
just turned around.

28
00:01:12,241 --> 00:01:15,187
CURSED

29
00:01:35,933 --> 00:01:38,967
The second I clean it up,
you're making more crumbs.

30
00:01:38,967 --> 00:01:41,681
-There should be more crumbs.
We should put crumbs
all over the goddamn bar.

31
00:01:41,681 --> 00:01:44,048
Sorry, but, Charlie, why am I
seeing so many silverfish?

32
00:01:44,102 --> 00:01:46,454
I-I don't know
where they're coming from, man.
I cannot get rid of them.

33
00:01:46,454 --> 00:01:50,389
You should not get rid of them.
Don't you guys understand
what Bar Rescue is?

34
00:01:50,389 --> 00:01:55,404
These are the exact
kind of things
that John Taffer's gonna come in
and hand our asses to us about.

35
00:01:55,404 --> 00:01:57,949
-DENNIS: Wait, wait, wait, wait.
No, I don't-- I don't want
to have my ass handed to me.

36
00:01:57,949 --> 00:02:01,189
I mean,
how the bar comes across is
-a reflection of
how I come across. Okay?

37
00:02:01,189 --> 00:02:05,633
And I, for one,
don't want to be known
as a silverfish man. Okay?

38
00:02:05,633 --> 00:02:08,299
I want to look good
for the people watching
in their...

39
00:02:14,151 --> 00:02:17,842
Uh... What's the-the thing?
The-the boxes
that-that people live in?

40
00:02:17,842 --> 00:02:20,818
- You talking about their homes?
- Y-- uh, yes, yeah. Their homes.

41
00:02:20,883 --> 00:02:23,157
-Jesus. I couldn't think of
that word. That's so weird.

42
00:02:23,157 --> 00:02:25,528
Guys, we have a problem.

43
00:02:25,528 --> 00:02:28,617
But whatever you do,
don't laugh.

44
00:02:30,582 --> 00:02:33,233
-How are we not supposed
to laugh at that?
-I wouldn't laugh at that.

45
00:02:33,233 --> 00:02:35,014
This is not funny, all right?
It's not a joke.

46
00:02:35,014 --> 00:02:37,342
I don't know
what's going on with my face,
but it's broken or something.

47
00:02:37,342 --> 00:02:39,846
-MAC: It's very funny.
-That's really funny.

48
00:02:39,917 --> 00:02:45,124
-Ah!
-My egg's all bloody.
- Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no.
This is bad, dude.

49
00:02:45,124 --> 00:02:48,166
This is the kind of stuff
that starts happening
when someone's
put a curse on you.

50
00:02:48,166 --> 00:02:49,891
-Curse? What are you
talking about?
-What?

51
00:02:49,891 --> 00:02:51,642
Let's just stop and think
for a second, okay?

52
00:02:51,642 --> 00:02:55,655
Like, Dee,
did you have any run-ins
with anyone who might have
put a curse on you?

53
00:02:55,655 --> 00:02:59,905
I mean, I had
a tiny little issue
with a neighbor last night.

54
00:02:59,905 --> 00:03:01,670
-Yes!

55
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:05,789
-Spewing my hate
all over your teenage asses.

56
00:03:05,789 --> 00:03:07,824
What?

57
00:03:07,824 --> 00:03:11,328
Banging the goddamn door down.
What?

58
00:03:11,573 --> 00:03:13,472
Yeah.

59
00:03:13,472 --> 00:03:16,708
What? Why are you trying
to break my door down
at 3:00 in the morning?

60
00:03:16,781 --> 00:03:18,156
I baked you some brownies.

61
00:03:18,245 --> 00:03:19,938
Why you baking me shit?
Trying to poison me?

62
00:03:19,938 --> 00:03:25,217
No.
I just wanted to kindly ask if
you could keep the noise down.

63
00:03:25,217 --> 00:03:30,125
Oh. Oh, no. I'm so sorry.
I didn't realize.

64
00:03:30,125 --> 00:03:33,080
-That was really sweet of you...
-...to bake these for me.

65
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,374
Hey,
I have something for you also.

66
00:03:34,374 --> 00:03:36,684
-Oh, it's so nice. What is it?

67
00:03:36,684 --> 00:03:41,485
Well, it's a trophy. See?
It says "Cunt of the Year."

68
00:03:41,485 --> 00:03:43,511
That's you.

69
00:03:44,375 --> 00:03:46,548
You are a nasty woman,

70
00:03:46,607 --> 00:03:50,128
and bad things are going
to happen to you one day.

71
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:52,965
I guarantee it.

72
00:03:52,965 --> 00:03:54,488
Drop dead.

73
00:03:54,877 --> 00:03:57,547
Well, there you go. It sounded
like that lady cursed you.

74
00:03:57,608 --> 00:04:00,447
I don't know. I call old ladies
cunts all the time. We all do.

75
00:04:00,447 --> 00:04:03,232
-Right.
-That's true.
-No, she brings up a good point.
-We do. We do.

76
00:04:03,232 --> 00:04:04,686
-I called an old lady
a cunt this morning.

77
00:04:04,751 --> 00:04:05,910
-See?
-Did you? Yeah.
-I sure did. I sure did.

78
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:07,281
-No, I might've done it,
too, actually.

79
00:04:07,281 --> 00:04:10,482
-Honestly, for me this raises
an even bigger concern.
- Okay. What's that?

80
00:04:10,592 --> 00:04:12,497
Dee had no right
to give that trophy away.

81
00:04:12,497 --> 00:04:14,834
-I mean, we worked very,
very hard on that.

82
00:04:14,834 --> 00:04:16,674
We did. It's not easy to make.

83
00:04:16,674 --> 00:04:18,706
-Plus, she earned it, right?

84
00:04:18,706 --> 00:04:21,126
-And you earned it.
And you're just gonna
give it away? I mean...

85
00:04:21,185 --> 00:04:25,557
Either way,
this is all bullshit anyway,
because we're not having bad
luck, we're having good luck.

86
00:04:25,624 --> 00:04:27,845
- What about my egg?
- You know what that
might've been?

87
00:04:27,937 --> 00:04:30,520
Y-You might've gotten cursed
when you killed that seabird.

88
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:32,386
-What seabird?
-Oh, I didn't tell you guys
about this?

89
00:04:32,386 --> 00:04:35,071
Okay. So, the other day, uh, Frank's
making a banana daiquiri.

90
00:04:35,071 --> 00:04:36,955
Seagull flies
right into the bar.

91
00:04:36,955 --> 00:04:40,492
-Cheers.
-Yeah. Here you go.
It's tasty.

92
00:04:40,492 --> 00:04:43,564
-Oh, shit.
A seagull.

93
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:48,505
Oh, a little birdie.

94
00:04:48,505 --> 00:04:51,406
Oh, what a sweet little birdie.

95
00:04:51,475 --> 00:04:54,169
You want some food?
Want some?

96
00:04:54,169 --> 00:04:55,823
-(seagull squawking)
-Whoa! Shit, Frank!

97
00:04:55,823 --> 00:04:58,441
-Die!
-Ah, Frank. Jesus.

98
00:04:58,441 --> 00:05:01,068
Come here, you rat, die!

99
00:05:04,764 --> 00:05:08,341
And die, you fucking seagull.

100
00:05:08,341 --> 00:05:10,871
Bitch. Fucking cunt.

101
00:05:10,871 --> 00:05:13,758
Well, it's bad luck if a seabird
flies into a building.

102
00:05:13,758 --> 00:05:17,078
No, dude. It's bad luck
to kill a seabird.
Every sailor knows that.

103
00:05:17,078 --> 00:05:18,192
I don't sail.

104
00:05:18,192 --> 00:05:21,940
Charlie,
will you stop trying to turn
our good fortune
into bad fortune?

105
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:24,471
All this doom and gloom.
Nobody is cursed.

106
00:05:24,471 --> 00:05:28,353
Oh, really, Mac?
Because I straight-up heard
Cricket curse you yesterday.

107
00:05:28,509 --> 00:05:31,115
All right.
It's time to make good
on your end of the bargain, Mac.

108
00:05:31,203 --> 00:05:32,506
What are you talking about?
I still need proof.

109
00:05:32,506 --> 00:05:34,386
Oh, come on, man.
Don't start with that.

110
00:05:34,386 --> 00:05:35,650
-Cricket, what are you doing
in here, man?

111
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:37,787
That's what I was just saying.
Cricket, what are you doing
in here?

112
00:05:37,856 --> 00:05:40,022
What? What-what-- No,
we're-we're talking business.

113
00:05:40,022 --> 00:05:42,359
Business? I'm not doing
business with you, street trash.

114
00:05:42,359 --> 00:05:43,795
What is your deal, man?
What-what...

115
00:05:43,873 --> 00:05:46,345
One second you need me,
the next I'm a pile of garbage?
Is that what this is?

116
00:05:46,345 --> 00:05:49,562
-Cricket, beat it, man...
- You better beat it, or I'm
gonna beat you with my shoe.

117
00:05:49,562 --> 00:05:51,848
-Get out of the bar, dude.
- You know what? Screw you guys.

118
00:05:51,911 --> 00:05:56,612
Oh. Hey, Mac.
A curse on you.

119
00:05:56,671 --> 00:06:01,392
Vos omnes maledicti mille annis.

120
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:04,693
I mean, he-he literally
cursed you, man.

121
00:06:04,693 --> 00:06:06,321
Now, guys, come on.
We got to take this seriously.

122
00:06:06,321 --> 00:06:09,915
Like, let's look at this.
Like, uh, Frank.
Let-Let's do our homework
on sailors' curses.

123
00:06:09,915 --> 00:06:11,694
Dee, Mac,
go make your apologies.

124
00:06:11,755 --> 00:06:15,204
I will do nothing of the sort.
In fact, I am done
listening to this.

125
00:06:15,204 --> 00:06:17,992
It's irritating, anti-God,
and most importantly

126
00:06:17,992 --> 00:06:20,695
will not
make for good Bar Rescue banter.

127
00:06:20,695 --> 00:06:22,120
I am leaving.

128
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,843
Come on, man!

129
00:06:23,843 --> 00:06:27,305
Charlie, how do you know
all this curse...

130
00:06:29,335 --> 00:06:30,922
-Stuff?
-Yeah.

131
00:06:30,944 --> 00:06:34,363
That-- I mean, look,
maybe it's real, maybe it's not.
But, like, look at it this way.

132
00:06:34,363 --> 00:06:37,541
Like, i-if a black cat
crosses your path,
do you spit
over your left shoulder?

133
00:06:37,541 --> 00:06:39,110
-Uh-uh.
-Why would I do that?
-No.

134
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:40,882
-You guys don't do that one?
- I don't know what that is.

135
00:06:40,953 --> 00:06:43,931
Well, I mean, like,
when you're hopeful
for something, though,
do you knock on wood?

136
00:06:43,931 --> 00:06:46,533
-Oh, that one. No. No.
-I've heard of that one,
but I don't do it.

137
00:06:46,533 --> 00:06:48,532
Well, do you make a wish
when you blow out
a damn candle? I mean...

138
00:06:48,532 --> 00:06:50,768
-Of course we do.
-Yes.
-Ah, yes, that one I do.

139
00:06:50,768 --> 00:06:52,827
-Candles, yeah, I like that.
Well, 'cause I want my wishes
to come true.

140
00:06:52,827 --> 00:06:56,363
Okay. And why do you do it?
You do it just in case.

141
00:06:56,403 --> 00:06:59,867
Just in case it's real, right?

142
00:06:59,867 --> 00:07:03,887
And "just in case" is
as good a reason
to believe in anything as any.

143
00:07:08,649 --> 00:07:11,873
I got to call a doctor
or something.

144
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:15,466
Oh, no, you definitely should.
I'm pretty sure you have
Bell's palsy.
I, uh, I looked it up.

145
00:07:15,466 --> 00:07:17,499
But first you got to apologize
to your neighbor.

146
00:07:17,499 --> 00:07:19,905
Yeah. Just in case? Hmm?

147
00:07:19,947 --> 00:07:23,584
Just in ca-- No, no.
I don't believe in
that bullshit. No.

148
00:07:23,663 --> 00:07:26,970
She's got the trophy.
I want to get the trophy back.
You had no right
to give that to her.

149
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:30,959
I swear to God,
if she doesn't have that thing,
I'm gonna paralyze
the other side of your face.
'Cause I want it.

150
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:35,267
Come on, that's-that's crazy.
You-you have to be nominated
for that.

151
00:07:35,267 --> 00:07:40,292
Hello, um, you don't know me,
but I'm the brother
of this horrible woman,

152
00:07:40,292 --> 00:07:44,174
and she just wanted to come by
and tell you
that she's very...

153
00:07:46,118 --> 00:07:49,202
Uh, she-she feels--
She, uh...

154
00:07:49,202 --> 00:07:51,839
Oh, what's the word?
To make better
the feelings?

155
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:55,414
-"Sorry"?
-Sorry. Yes. Goddamn.

156
00:07:55,507 --> 00:07:59,117
Um... I don't know
what that--
Um, and also, she, um...

157
00:07:59,117 --> 00:08:02,725
She gave you something,
uh, a trophy,
and-and it was not hers to give.

158
00:08:02,805 --> 00:08:04,300
Do-do you perhaps
still have that?

159
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:06,616
-Yeah, I have it. I'll get it.
-Yeah? Okay, great.

160
00:08:06,616 --> 00:08:11,711
You know what?
I got to look up some clinics,
'cause I really need a doctor
to fix my face
before we're on TV.

161
00:08:11,711 --> 00:08:14,156
-Uh-oh.
Whoa. Did-did you see that?

162
00:08:14,248 --> 00:08:16,762
-What?
See what?

163
00:08:16,817 --> 00:08:18,949
Uh, a black cat just ran
out of her apartment.

164
00:08:18,983 --> 00:08:20,920
-It just...
-I didn't see a cat.

165
00:08:20,953 --> 00:08:22,690
You kidding me?
It ran right past us.

166
00:08:22,724 --> 00:08:23,726
Well, that's not good.

167
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:25,496
-A black cat?
-Yeah.

168
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:26,899
Well, shit. What'd Charlie say
we were supposed to do

169
00:08:26,932 --> 00:08:27,967
if we saw it?
That's a bad omen.

170
00:08:31,842 --> 00:08:33,813
Uh-oh. I got you, didn't I?
Sorry about that.

171
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:34,948
-Yes, you did.
-Yeah.

172
00:08:34,981 --> 00:08:36,418
Boy, that's a shame.

173
00:08:36,451 --> 00:08:37,654
-Thank you for this, though.
-Yeah.

174
00:08:37,687 --> 00:08:39,724
Um, listen, um...
Do you have a cat?

175
00:08:39,758 --> 00:08:41,662
'Cause I think I just saw one
run out of your apartment.

176
00:08:41,695 --> 00:08:43,566
-A cat?
-Yeah, yeah. A little black cat?

177
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:46,939
I had a little black cat.
Her name was Maureen.

178
00:08:48,041 --> 00:08:49,411
Whoa.

179
00:08:49,444 --> 00:08:51,548
But she's been dead for years.

180
00:08:51,582 --> 00:08:53,819
Huh. That's crazy.

181
00:08:53,853 --> 00:08:55,923
I was, I was murdered
to a woman named Maureen.

182
00:08:55,957 --> 00:08:57,393
-Huh?
-Huh?

183
00:08:57,427 --> 00:08:58,729
No, I meant married.
I'm sorry.

184
00:08:58,762 --> 00:08:59,965
I was married
to a woman named Maureen.

185
00:08:59,998 --> 00:09:01,401
I-I...

186
00:09:01,435 --> 00:09:03,405
That's so weird.
I swear I saw a cat.

187
00:09:03,439 --> 00:09:04,641
You know what?
This place is full of cats.

188
00:09:04,674 --> 00:09:05,676
Can we get out of here,
please?

189
00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:07,012
-Yeah, go. Go.
-Okay.

190
00:09:07,045 --> 00:09:09,484
And please keep
the noise down at night.

191
00:09:09,518 --> 00:09:11,522
Yeah. Okay, you got it, cunt.

192
00:09:14,427 --> 00:09:15,763
Are you sure about this,
Cricket?

193
00:09:15,796 --> 00:09:17,600
Yeah, I'm sure about it, man.

194
00:09:17,634 --> 00:09:18,869
I've been greasing the doormen
of this building for years.

195
00:09:18,903 --> 00:09:20,506
Chase Utley's back in town.

196
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:22,377
He's coming out of his apartment
any second now.

197
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:23,879
Is it good intel? 'Cause I only
got one good shot at this.

198
00:09:23,913 --> 00:09:25,416
Maybe it is, maybe it isn't.
What do I know?

199
00:09:25,449 --> 00:09:26,752
I'm just a street rat, right?

200
00:09:26,785 --> 00:09:28,656
I'm just trash.
That's what you said.

201
00:09:28,689 --> 00:09:29,958
-Okay, Cricks, I'll tell you...
-You've got nothing for me.

202
00:09:29,991 --> 00:09:31,528
I knew you were gonna be
a little bit of

203
00:09:31,562 --> 00:09:32,095
a bitch about this,
so I did something nice.

204
00:09:32,864 --> 00:09:35,469
-I got
you a sixer.
-You got that for me?

205
00:09:35,503 --> 00:09:36,672
Yeah, I got a gift for you,
buddy.

206
00:09:36,705 --> 00:09:38,709
There's only four in here.

207
00:09:38,742 --> 00:09:40,413
I drank two of 'em, of course.

208
00:09:40,446 --> 00:09:42,082
Okay. All right. Well,
thank you.

209
00:09:42,115 --> 00:09:43,752
Oh, I'm gonna buy a six-pack
and not drink two?

210
00:09:43,786 --> 00:09:45,890
Well, yeah. That's kind of
the kind thing to...

211
00:09:45,923 --> 00:09:47,827
But I-- Look, um,
thank you for the four.

212
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:48,963
If I'm being honest,
I drank four.

213
00:09:48,996 --> 00:09:50,700
Two of those are piss.

214
00:09:50,733 --> 00:09:52,102
Because I was stuck in the van,
and you were out...

215
00:09:52,135 --> 00:09:53,939
You know what,
I don't even care, frankly.

216
00:09:53,973 --> 00:09:55,376
-I'm just glad
to have a beverage.
-Yeah. All right.

217
00:09:55,409 --> 00:09:56,678
All right, um...

218
00:09:56,712 --> 00:09:58,482
-Dominus espritu sanctum, okay?

219
00:09:58,515 --> 00:10:00,686
-You're off.
-What was that?

220
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,590
I was, uh, I was lifting
the curse that I put on you.

221
00:10:02,624 --> 00:10:05,863
Oh. Yeah, no,
I don't believe in curses.

222
00:10:05,897 --> 00:10:07,533
Yeah, that's anti-God,

223
00:10:07,567 --> 00:10:09,069
and God is the reason
that all things happen.

224
00:10:09,103 --> 00:10:10,673
And speaking of
things that happened,

225
00:10:10,706 --> 00:10:12,677
I got to show you something,
Cricks,

226
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:14,981
but you got to keep it a secret.

227
00:10:16,017 --> 00:10:18,422
Something wrong with your dick?

228
00:10:18,455 --> 00:10:20,158
-What?
-Okay, I was waiting for this.

229
00:10:20,191 --> 00:10:21,929
If it's your dick, though,
I-I got to charge you for it.

230
00:10:21,962 --> 00:10:23,031
I'm gonna tell you right now.

231
00:10:23,064 --> 00:10:24,868
No. It's not my dick, Cricket.

232
00:10:24,901 --> 00:10:26,070
Well, if-if you're gonna
whip it out, uh,

233
00:10:26,103 --> 00:10:27,974
we're on the clock.
All right?

234
00:10:28,007 --> 00:10:29,678
-I'm not whipping anything out!
-There's a tiered system...

235
00:10:29,711 --> 00:10:31,548
Look. This.

236
00:10:31,582 --> 00:10:33,151
What? What is that?

237
00:10:33,184 --> 00:10:35,690
It's a monkey paw,
and I think it's good luck,

238
00:10:35,723 --> 00:10:37,059
like a rabbit's foot
or something like that,

239
00:10:37,092 --> 00:10:38,596
'cause ever since I found it,

240
00:10:38,629 --> 00:10:40,065
nothing but good things
have happened.

241
00:10:40,098 --> 00:10:41,668
Uh, sorry, I thought
God was the reason

242
00:10:41,702 --> 00:10:43,639
that anything good happens,
et cetera.

243
00:10:43,672 --> 00:10:47,614
Well, no. God decides
who the good things happen to

244
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:49,149
and then who he smites.

245
00:10:49,183 --> 00:10:50,987
-You're not following.
-I-I can't follow it.

246
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:52,690
-Cricket, I'm...
-It makes literally no sense.

247
00:10:52,724 --> 00:10:55,028
-You got to pick a lane.
-I don't even know why I even...

248
00:10:55,061 --> 00:10:56,665
-CRICKET: Let's get this open.
I'm feeling curious.
-Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.

249
00:10:56,698 --> 00:10:57,867
Wait, that's-- there he is,
there he is. Okay.

250
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:59,437
Let's go.

251
00:10:59,471 --> 00:11:02,075
-Mr. Utley?

252
00:11:02,109 --> 00:11:04,079
Mr. Utley?

253
00:11:04,113 --> 00:11:06,217
Mr. Utley, a moment
of your time, sir.

254
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:07,987
Mr. Utley?

255
00:11:08,021 --> 00:11:09,891
Mr. Utley, hello?

256
00:11:09,924 --> 00:11:12,864
Hello. Oh, hi. Hi, Mr. Utley.

257
00:11:12,897 --> 00:11:14,801
Hey, uh, would you
like an autograph?

258
00:11:14,834 --> 00:11:17,139
Oh, no. That's a cl--
a classic, Mr. Utley.

259
00:11:17,172 --> 00:11:20,145
-I-It's me, Mac.
-I don't know a Mac.

260
00:11:20,178 --> 00:11:22,149
I wrote you a letter every week
for the last ten years.

261
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:24,554
Did you not receive my letters?
There was a video.

262
00:11:24,587 --> 00:11:26,658
A video in response. Wait.

263
00:11:26,692 --> 00:11:28,929
"Dear Mac, I feel like
I can call you Mac

264
00:11:28,962 --> 00:11:30,666
"because you called me Chase.

265
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:33,539
"Thank you for the compliment
on my hair.

266
00:11:33,572 --> 00:11:34,941
"It's my fourth favorite thing
after baseball,

267
00:11:34,975 --> 00:11:37,613
"running fast and my dad.

268
00:11:37,647 --> 00:11:39,484
"I'm sorry your dad
doesn't like you.

269
00:11:39,517 --> 00:11:41,655
"Maybe you could
become a better son.

270
00:11:41,688 --> 00:11:43,492
"Meeting you and having
a game of catch

271
00:11:43,525 --> 00:11:45,195
"sounds like a lot of fun,
but like I said,

272
00:11:45,228 --> 00:11:48,101
"I'm really busy playing a lot
of baseball for the Phillies.

273
00:11:48,134 --> 00:11:50,171
"I hope you have a good life.

274
00:11:50,205 --> 00:11:52,610
"Fans like you make my life
a 'grand slam.'

275
00:11:52,643 --> 00:11:54,781
Your good friend, Chase."

276
00:11:54,814 --> 00:11:56,785
-Wait, you're that Mac?
-Yes.

277
00:11:56,818 --> 00:11:59,056
I thought Mac was a little kid.

278
00:11:59,089 --> 00:12:01,561
Yes, there's a child. A child...

279
00:12:01,595 --> 00:12:04,768
A child born unto me.
Little Mac.

280
00:12:04,801 --> 00:12:06,505
-What?
-He's Little Mac, I'm Big Mac,

281
00:12:06,538 --> 00:12:07,707
and you shall have
a catch with him.

282
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:08,976
Your hair, it's throwing me.

283
00:12:09,009 --> 00:12:11,147
It's making me very nervous.

284
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:12,984
On the Dodgers, yes,
you were the Silver Fox.

285
00:12:13,017 --> 00:12:14,988
Philadelphia,
you were just the Fox.

286
00:12:15,021 --> 00:12:16,858
I don't know, man.
I'm pretty busy.

287
00:12:16,892 --> 00:12:20,700
Yes, we're all, we're all busy,
but the boy is sick.

288
00:12:22,069 --> 00:12:23,839
He's very sick.
He's, he's dying.

289
00:12:23,872 --> 00:12:26,912
He's got leukemia and you shall
have a catch with him.

290
00:12:26,945 --> 00:12:29,584
-Where's my car?
-I'll tweet that you didn't.

291
00:12:29,617 --> 00:12:31,120
I'm sorry. I threatened you.

292
00:12:31,153 --> 00:12:32,690
Now I'm upset and so are you.

293
00:12:34,026 --> 00:12:37,734
A catch, we shall have?
Later today.

294
00:12:37,767 --> 00:12:40,539
Okay. Maybe, but for, like,
five minutes tops.

295
00:12:40,573 --> 00:12:43,278
-Yes. Yes, yes.
-I'm really busy.

296
00:12:43,312 --> 00:12:45,181
-CHARLIE: Mom?

297
00:12:45,215 --> 00:12:47,620
Hey, can we pick your brain
about something?

298
00:12:47,653 --> 00:12:50,760
Oh, Charlie, I didn't think
you could make it.

299
00:12:50,793 --> 00:12:53,999
-Come on in.
-Yeah, shit, I forgot
it's Uncle Jack's birthday.

300
00:12:54,032 --> 00:12:56,003
Come on in, Charlie.
You can sit next to me.

301
00:12:56,036 --> 00:12:58,609
Nah, I'm good. Uh, we'll
come back later or something.

302
00:12:58,642 --> 00:13:00,613
No, no, no, no, Charlie.
I want a piece of cake.

303
00:13:00,646 --> 00:13:02,082
-Come on.
-Oh, do you? Oh, shit.

304
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:03,652
Okay, all right, all right.

305
00:13:03,685 --> 00:13:06,725
♪ Happy birthday, dear Jack ♪

306
00:13:06,758 --> 00:13:10,231
-♪ Happy birthday to you. ♪
-Can we switch seats?

307
00:13:10,266 --> 00:13:12,202
-Okay, make a wish.

308
00:13:12,235 --> 00:13:14,607
Oh, right, right, right.
Okay, you and I hold hands.

309
00:13:14,641 --> 00:13:17,012
-Nope.
-Okay, ready?

310
00:13:17,045 --> 00:13:18,715
-All right.

311
00:13:18,749 --> 00:13:20,352
-Oh!
-Good. All right.
Very good, very good.

312
00:13:20,386 --> 00:13:22,022
Hey, you want to know
my wish, Charlie?

313
00:13:22,055 --> 00:13:23,926
-Sure don't, pal.
-Ooh, don't tell him your wish,

314
00:13:23,959 --> 00:13:26,030
-it won't come true.
-Yeah, there you go.

315
00:13:26,063 --> 00:13:27,867
-Exactly.
-I made a wish, too.

316
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:30,071
How about you and me go on
upstairs with some cake, Bon?

317
00:13:30,105 --> 00:13:31,975
Hey, Frank, you don't
get a wish, okay?

318
00:13:32,008 --> 00:13:33,812
-That's not how
birthday candles work.

319
00:13:33,846 --> 00:13:35,749
-Says who?
-Uh, look, that's not
why we're here!

320
00:13:35,783 --> 00:13:37,219
Mom, Frank killed a seagull.

321
00:13:39,958 --> 00:13:41,361
Hey, that's not good, Frank.

322
00:13:41,394 --> 00:13:42,997
Yeah, we know it's not good,
Uncle Jack. Okay?

323
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:44,734
That's why-- that's why
we came here, all right?

324
00:13:44,768 --> 00:13:46,338
Mom, now is that the kind
of thing that could put, like,

325
00:13:46,371 --> 00:13:49,811
-a curse on Frank?
-Yes.

326
00:13:49,844 --> 00:13:54,354
They say that a sailor's spirit
lives on in the gulls,

327
00:13:54,387 --> 00:13:57,025
and if you kill a gull,
the sailor

328
00:13:57,058 --> 00:13:59,163
can haunt you
for the rest of its life.

329
00:13:59,196 --> 00:14:01,167
-No shit?
-Yeah, well, is there
anything we can do,

330
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:04,340
-or, like...
-Well, you could slit
Frank's throat

331
00:14:04,374 --> 00:14:07,780
with a horn of a goat
and drink a bowl of his blood.

332
00:14:07,814 --> 00:14:09,284
What?

333
00:14:09,317 --> 00:14:11,788
Well, uh, okay, yeah,
maybe not, maybe not that.

334
00:14:11,822 --> 00:14:13,392
Is, like, there
anything else, or...

335
00:14:13,425 --> 00:14:14,928
Ooh!

336
00:14:14,961 --> 00:14:17,400
He could behead the gull
and wear its skull

337
00:14:17,433 --> 00:14:20,171
around his neck
for the rest of his life.

338
00:14:20,205 --> 00:14:21,408
Mom, that's not gonna work,
'cause we don't have

339
00:14:21,441 --> 00:14:23,312
-the gull anymore.
-Yeah, we do.

340
00:14:23,345 --> 00:14:24,848
It's at the bar.

341
00:14:24,881 --> 00:14:26,217
-What? It is?
-Mm, yeah.

342
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:27,720
I kicked it under
one of the booths

343
00:14:27,753 --> 00:14:29,256
so I didn't have to clean it up.

344
00:14:30,993 --> 00:14:32,830
Okay, so you're telling me
that you want to wear

345
00:14:32,864 --> 00:14:35,436
a seagull skull around your neck
for the rest of your life?

346
00:14:35,469 --> 00:14:37,773
I don't know. Could be cool.

347
00:14:37,807 --> 00:14:38,809
No, we're not doing that.
That's crazy.

348
00:14:38,842 --> 00:14:39,911
Mom, anything else?

349
00:14:39,944 --> 00:14:42,215
You could give the seagull

350
00:14:42,249 --> 00:14:44,754
a proper burial.

351
00:14:44,787 --> 00:14:47,827
What? Well, yeah,
that one, Mom. That one.

352
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:49,964
Why didn't you lead off with
that one in the first place?

353
00:14:49,998 --> 00:14:52,670
Well, sometimes
you're at sea, Charlie,

354
00:14:52,703 --> 00:14:54,908
and you wouldn't
have that option.

355
00:14:54,941 --> 00:14:56,444
Do I look like I'm at sea, Mom?

356
00:14:56,478 --> 00:14:58,247
-I don't know.
-You don't know if I'm at sea?

357
00:14:58,282 --> 00:14:59,717
-You don't, uh--
Uncle Jack, stop.

358
00:14:59,751 --> 00:15:00,786
Stop putting your hand on me.

359
00:15:08,402 --> 00:15:10,439
Looking for this.

360
00:15:10,472 --> 00:15:12,343
What is it?

361
00:15:12,376 --> 00:15:14,246
Maureen Ponderosa.

362
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:16,116
-Well, why do you have that?
-Well, I wanted to keep it

363
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:18,755
as a-a-a...

364
00:15:18,789 --> 00:15:21,260
Oh, a trophy? From the murder.

365
00:15:21,294 --> 00:15:23,231
No, not a-- What?
No, not a trophy.

366
00:15:23,265 --> 00:15:25,034
I-- As-- I wanted...

367
00:15:25,068 --> 00:15:26,705
Like a souvenir,
f-from your victim.

368
00:15:26,738 --> 00:15:28,241
Not a souvenir, no.
It's-it's, a...

369
00:15:28,275 --> 00:15:31,080
It's a-- I wanted to keep it
as a w-way to spite her.

370
00:15:31,113 --> 00:15:32,416
Which one? Which one's it under?

371
00:15:32,450 --> 00:15:34,454
-Uh, by the jukebox. Over here.
-Oh-- ah!

372
00:15:34,487 --> 00:15:36,023
-Over here.
-I see it, yeah.
Let me get a trash bag.

373
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:40,231
-What the hell is that?
-That's the gull Frank killed.

374
00:15:40,266 --> 00:15:42,403
-All right.
-What's that?

375
00:15:42,436 --> 00:15:44,006
Oh, that's his dead wife.

376
00:15:44,039 --> 00:15:45,476
-Yeah.
-Looks like a trophy.

377
00:15:45,509 --> 00:15:47,914
No, it's not a-a trophy, okay?

378
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:49,450
The crazy bitch had it
in her will that she wanted

379
00:15:49,484 --> 00:15:52,055
to be buried in a pet cemetery,
and I refused.

380
00:15:52,088 --> 00:15:53,492
Wait a second.

381
00:15:53,525 --> 00:15:55,396
You refused your wife's
dying wishes

382
00:15:55,429 --> 00:15:57,900
to be buried in a pet cemetery?
Why would you do that?

383
00:15:57,934 --> 00:15:59,370
Because she's not a cat.

384
00:15:59,404 --> 00:16:00,806
Yeah, but, dude, like,
that's-that's the exact

385
00:16:00,839 --> 00:16:01,908
kind of thing that could
lead to a curse.

386
00:16:01,942 --> 00:16:03,445
That... I know.

387
00:16:03,478 --> 00:16:05,816
-I-- Yes. Okay, I get that now.

388
00:16:05,849 --> 00:16:07,420
-This is bullshit, Cricket.
-I don't know what
you're so upset about.

389
00:16:07,453 --> 00:16:09,156
Y-You said get a kid.

390
00:16:09,189 --> 00:16:11,928
I mean, his name on the street
is literally "Kid."

391
00:16:11,962 --> 00:16:14,166
-That's what he goes by.
-He is a grown man.

392
00:16:14,199 --> 00:16:16,838
I can be whatever
you want me to be, champ.

393
00:16:16,871 --> 00:16:19,242
-I'll make your dreams
come true.
-Oh, he can.

394
00:16:19,277 --> 00:16:21,013
-Would you make it--
Do a, do a turn. Do a spin.
-Oh.

395
00:16:22,082 --> 00:16:24,052
There you go. Make it sexy.
Let's go.

396
00:16:25,589 --> 00:16:27,526
-Yeah.

397
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:29,096
Uh, move the bangs,
put the bangs.

398
00:16:29,129 --> 00:16:30,766
Show them your face,
show them your face.

399
00:16:30,799 --> 00:16:33,037
-Yeah. Huh?
-Hey.

400
00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:34,974
-Get him out of here.
-All right, yeah. You're gone.

401
00:16:35,008 --> 00:16:36,110
-Uh, here. Go.
-Oh, yeah...

402
00:16:36,143 --> 00:16:37,280
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

403
00:16:37,313 --> 00:16:38,482
Drugs? Mm.

404
00:16:38,515 --> 00:16:40,853
-No eyes.

405
00:16:40,886 --> 00:16:42,088
Okay.

406
00:16:42,122 --> 00:16:43,257
It's all about respect.

407
00:16:43,292 --> 00:16:44,827
Mac, what the hell is this?

408
00:16:44,861 --> 00:16:47,500
Um, I believe that Cricket
is now a pimp,

409
00:16:47,533 --> 00:16:49,337
and that was his boy slut.

410
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:51,474
Uh, t-that's oversimplifying it.

411
00:16:51,508 --> 00:16:53,578
But, uh, that's-that's it
in a nutshell.

412
00:16:53,612 --> 00:16:55,181
No, we got that.
He got, yeah, he means like...

413
00:16:55,214 --> 00:16:57,386
Yes. I-I mean,
what are you doing with Cricket?

414
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:58,855
No, he's got a monkey paw.

415
00:16:58,889 --> 00:17:01,226
Ugh, come on, Cricket.
That's a secret.

416
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:02,997
Oh, I can't keep secret--
Honestly, I'm so high,

417
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:04,567
I'm thinking about it,
and I'm gonna go

418
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:07,238
with him in the bathroom
and finish up the-- Yeah.

419
00:17:07,273 --> 00:17:08,842
CHARLIE:
Mac, what's going on

420
00:17:08,875 --> 00:17:10,279
with the monkey paw?
What is this?

421
00:17:10,312 --> 00:17:11,414
You know how I've been
chasing Chase Utley

422
00:17:11,448 --> 00:17:13,084
for years to have a catch?

423
00:17:13,117 --> 00:17:15,054
Well, I finally got to him
and we were supposed

424
00:17:15,088 --> 00:17:17,560
to have a catch tomorrow
with my "dying son."

425
00:17:17,593 --> 00:17:19,262
Cricket was gonna
help me find one,

426
00:17:19,297 --> 00:17:21,468
-but he brought back a junkie.
-Wait, wait, wait.

427
00:17:21,501 --> 00:17:24,172
You actually met Chase Utley?
How'd you do that?

428
00:17:24,206 --> 00:17:26,277
Well, ever since I found
this monkey's paw,

429
00:17:26,311 --> 00:17:28,214
my luck has totally
turned around.

430
00:17:28,247 --> 00:17:30,886
Well, actually,
it wasn't just a paw.

431
00:17:30,919 --> 00:17:33,925
It was a whole monkey behind
the kegs, and he was dead.

432
00:17:33,959 --> 00:17:35,996
He had this cash in his hand,
and when I went

433
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:37,967
to grab the cash, the whole hand
just, like, kind of popped out,

434
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,504
and I've been carrying it around
ever since.

435
00:17:39,537 --> 00:17:41,374
Monkey in the bar,
right? Totally random.

436
00:17:41,408 --> 00:17:43,378
Wha-- that-that's not
random at all.

437
00:17:43,412 --> 00:17:45,482
That's probably the monkey
that worked here,

438
00:17:45,516 --> 00:17:47,353
-robbed us and fucked our faces.
-FRANK: He got stuck
behind the keg.

439
00:17:47,386 --> 00:17:49,357
-It's behind the kegs?
-MAC: Well, actually,

440
00:17:49,390 --> 00:17:51,260
I found him by the office,
but I kicked him behind the kegs

441
00:17:51,294 --> 00:17:53,230
because I didn't feel
like cleaning him up.

442
00:17:53,265 --> 00:17:54,534
-Oh!
-Goddamn it!

443
00:17:54,567 --> 00:17:56,136
-Well, he is decomposing

444
00:17:56,170 --> 00:17:58,074
and there's also
a shit-ton of mold back there.

445
00:17:58,107 --> 00:17:59,042
-Shit, now I smell it.
-I don't know
how I missed that.

446
00:17:59,076 --> 00:18:00,946
CHARLIE:
Okay, okay.

447
00:18:00,979 --> 00:18:02,316
I got a new fix, all right?
I got a new fix for everything.

448
00:18:02,349 --> 00:18:04,252
We're gonna take, uh, your wife,

449
00:18:04,287 --> 00:18:05,956
the gull
and what's left of the monkey,

450
00:18:05,989 --> 00:18:07,493
and we're gonna bury them all
in a pet cemetery.

451
00:18:07,526 --> 00:18:09,597
And Mac, you are gonna have
a catch with Chase Utley,

452
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:11,233
but not with your dying son.

453
00:18:11,267 --> 00:18:13,372
-Why not?
-'Cause he's already dead.

454
00:18:15,976 --> 00:18:17,245
CHASE:
I'm confused.

455
00:18:17,279 --> 00:18:18,482
This is your son?

456
00:18:18,515 --> 00:18:20,118
Oh, yes, Mr. Utley.

457
00:18:20,151 --> 00:18:21,654
I didn't have the heart
to tell you earlier.

458
00:18:21,688 --> 00:18:24,226
He was only ten years old
when he died. He's dead now.

459
00:18:24,259 --> 00:18:26,130
Why is he buried
at a pet cemetery?

460
00:18:26,163 --> 00:18:29,069
Dogs. He loved dogs.

461
00:18:29,102 --> 00:18:30,506
Okay, man. What is this?

462
00:18:30,539 --> 00:18:32,309
What's going on?

463
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:36,250
I'm sorry, I...

464
00:18:36,284 --> 00:18:39,957
Look, I know you're
gonna think that this is crazy,

465
00:18:39,991 --> 00:18:41,995
but I-I found this monkey paw,

466
00:18:42,028 --> 00:18:43,899
and it's brought me
really good luck.

467
00:18:43,932 --> 00:18:46,438
And I know that you don't think
superstitions are real,

468
00:18:46,471 --> 00:18:47,907
and that this is all
ridiculous...

469
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:49,644
Not real?
Of course they're real.

470
00:18:49,677 --> 00:18:51,948
-What, really?
-Yeah.

471
00:18:51,981 --> 00:18:53,418
How do you think baseball
players get out of their slumps?

472
00:18:53,452 --> 00:18:55,254
With superstitions.

473
00:18:55,289 --> 00:18:57,560
'Cause what they believe
influences their actions.

474
00:18:57,593 --> 00:18:59,196
But actions do have
consequences.

475
00:18:59,229 --> 00:19:01,634
Like lying, Mac.

476
00:19:01,668 --> 00:19:03,405
Why don't you hand over
that monkey paw?

477
00:19:05,342 --> 00:19:07,178
You're right.

478
00:19:07,212 --> 00:19:10,419
You're right, actions
do have consequences, and I...

479
00:19:10,452 --> 00:19:12,423
I'm really sorry, man,
I think...

480
00:19:12,456 --> 00:19:14,961
Hall of Fame, baby, here I come!

481
00:19:16,498 --> 00:19:18,702
What the hell
was that all about?

482
00:19:18,735 --> 00:19:22,041
I think Chase Utley
just stole my monkey paw.

483
00:19:22,075 --> 00:19:24,547
Oh. Well, then, maybe
the curse has been lifted.

484
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:27,085
-Oh. Right, yeah.
-Uh, hey, guys? Um...

485
00:19:27,118 --> 00:19:29,156
-Hmm?
-Check this out.

486
00:19:29,189 --> 00:19:31,661
Okay, so, apparently, um...

487
00:19:31,694 --> 00:19:34,367
temporary facial paralysis
and brain fog

488
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,704
are all symptoms of exposure
to high levels of mold.

489
00:19:37,706 --> 00:19:39,410
-Huh?
-Oh...

490
00:19:39,443 --> 00:19:41,748
You know what? That might
also explain the silverfish.

491
00:19:41,781 --> 00:19:43,250
Yeah, no, it does.
Actually, it does.

492
00:19:43,285 --> 00:19:44,453
They eat mold.

493
00:19:44,487 --> 00:19:45,656
-Huh?
-And what about my egg?

494
00:19:45,689 --> 00:19:46,691
Well, is it possible, Frank,

495
00:19:46,724 --> 00:19:48,428
that that egg was a seagull egg?

496
00:19:50,332 --> 00:19:52,001
-Oh...
-That might've been,
because, you know what,

497
00:19:52,035 --> 00:19:53,605
-we found some eggs...
-And we...

498
00:19:53,638 --> 00:19:55,309
-And you might've mixed them up.
-I might've swapped--

499
00:19:55,342 --> 00:19:56,978
-mixed them up.
-Yeah, 'cause we had store eggs

500
00:19:57,011 --> 00:19:58,381
-and we had found eggs.
-You did a flip-flop.

501
00:19:58,415 --> 00:19:59,517
-You did a flip-flop.
-Yeah, there you go.

502
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:00,719
So, the-- so, there's no curse.

503
00:20:00,752 --> 00:20:02,623
Oh, no. Hold on a second.

504
00:20:02,656 --> 00:20:04,560
"Dear Mr. McDonald,
we regret to inform you

505
00:20:04,594 --> 00:20:07,333
that we came by your bar
and there was nobody there."

506
00:20:07,366 --> 00:20:09,102
-Huh?
-"After several failed attempts

507
00:20:09,135 --> 00:20:11,374
"to reach you, we have decided
to rescind our offer.

508
00:20:11,407 --> 00:20:14,413
We wish you the best of luck.
Your friends at Bar Rescue."

509
00:20:14,447 --> 00:20:15,782
Damn it.
If I had that monkey paw,

510
00:20:15,816 --> 00:20:17,453
none of this would've happened.

511
00:20:17,486 --> 00:20:18,655
Yeah, so that means
we are still cursed.

512
00:20:18,688 --> 00:20:20,091
-Oh, no.
-Shit.
-It doesn't!

513
00:20:20,124 --> 00:20:21,427
We're not-- There is no curse.

514
00:20:21,461 --> 00:20:23,431
Okay? Mac, no,
you were never lucky.

515
00:20:23,465 --> 00:20:25,569
Okay? You just bombarded them
both with mail.

516
00:20:25,602 --> 00:20:27,238
And you stalked Chase Utley
for years.

517
00:20:27,273 --> 00:20:30,345
We're not unlucky, okay?
We're just the type of...

518
00:20:30,379 --> 00:20:32,683
We're just the type of people
to bury various animals

519
00:20:32,716 --> 00:20:35,289
and-and wives in a pet cemetery

520
00:20:35,322 --> 00:20:36,791
when we know
we should be at work.

521
00:20:36,824 --> 00:20:39,062
-Oh, yeah.
-Let's go back to the bar.

522
00:20:39,095 --> 00:20:40,766
-Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

523
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:43,103
Uh, what about me?
What about my luck?

524
00:20:43,137 --> 00:20:46,744
I don't know, Cricks, I guess...
there's no real explanation

525
00:20:46,778 --> 00:20:48,748
as to why bad things
would happen to you.

526
00:20:48,782 --> 00:20:50,786
-Yeah.
-Maybe it's just one
of those things, Cricket.

527
00:20:50,819 --> 00:20:52,356
-That's life.
That's life, sometimes.
-Yeah, man.

528
00:20:52,389 --> 00:20:54,092
-It is what it is.
-You got a dark cloud

529
00:20:54,125 --> 00:20:56,096
-following you around.
-CHARLIE: It is what it is.

530
00:20:56,129 --> 00:20:57,533
-FRANK: That's all
there is to it.
-MAC: It is what it is.

531
00:20:57,566 --> 00:20:58,501
-CHARLIE: It is what it is.
-DENNIS: Nice day.
