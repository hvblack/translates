1
00:00:00,714 --> 00:00:04,116
<i>Cheers is filmed
before a live studio audience.</i>

2
00:00:05,051 --> 00:00:06,118
Come in.

3
00:00:08,171 --> 00:00:11,239
- Mind if I use your office?
- Again?

4
00:00:11,274 --> 00:00:13,625
Hey, you think I like
having to do this?

5
00:00:13,659 --> 00:00:16,833
You know how hard it is
to breast-feed twins?

6
00:00:18,064 --> 00:00:22,366
I haven't had my bra
off and on this much
since junior high.

7
00:00:24,621 --> 00:00:27,796
Hey.
Maybe you could help.

8
00:00:31,227 --> 00:00:33,495
What do you mean "help"?

9
00:00:33,529 --> 00:00:36,870
Well, you got
a decent set of ducts.

10
00:00:38,351 --> 00:00:42,304
Maybe I could use you
as a decoy.
You see?

11
00:00:42,338 --> 00:00:46,530
While I'm pumping one kid,
the other one's attached to you.

12
00:00:47,243 --> 00:00:50,245
- Are you serious?
- Sure! It'll shut 'em up.

13
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:53,522
So they won't get milk.
Life is hard.

14
00:00:59,105 --> 00:01:01,890
¶ Making your way
in the world today ¶

15
00:01:01,924 --> 00:01:04,576
¶ Takes everything you've got.

16
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:07,731
¶ Taking a break
from all your worries ¶

17
00:01:07,731 --> 00:01:10,382
¶ Sure would help a lot.

18
00:01:10,416 --> 00:01:15,079
¶ Wouldn't you like
to get away? ¶

19
00:01:16,355 --> 00:01:19,057
¶ Sometimes you want to go.

20
00:01:19,091 --> 00:01:23,545
¶ Where everybody
knows your name ¶

21
00:01:23,579 --> 00:01:28,680
¶ And they're always glad
you came ¶

22
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:31,529
¶ You want to be
where you can see ¶

23
00:01:31,529 --> 00:01:34,073
¶ Our troubles
are all the same ¶

24
00:01:34,107 --> 00:01:39,041
¶ You want to be where everybody
knows your name ¶

25
00:01:39,041 --> 00:01:41,753
¶ You want to go
where people know ¶

26
00:01:41,753 --> 00:01:44,433
¶ People are all the same.

27
00:01:44,467 --> 00:01:49,412
¶ You want to go where
everybody knows your name. ¶

28
00:02:04,119 --> 00:02:06,971
- Good evening, everyone!
- Hello.

29
00:02:07,006 --> 00:02:08,740
You know, it's
uncanny, my darling,

30
00:02:08,774 --> 00:02:12,860
but there's not a room
you step foot into
where you're not the most
beautiful woman there.

31
00:02:12,895 --> 00:02:15,413
That's deplorable sentence
structure, Frasier.

32
00:02:15,448 --> 00:02:19,417
What you mean to say is that
I am the most beautiful
woman in any room I enter.

33
00:02:19,451 --> 00:02:23,621
Yes. Well, thank you
for correcting me
in front of 30 people.

34
00:02:25,492 --> 00:02:28,743
- There you go,
your usual cured spritzer.
- Thanks, Sam.

35
00:02:28,778 --> 00:02:32,179
- Hey, the big day is around
the corner, isn't it?
- Yeah, next Saturday.

36
00:02:32,214 --> 00:02:35,121
Lilith and I have
been in the process
of writing, editing,

37
00:02:35,121 --> 00:02:38,453
rewriting,
and researching
our wedding vows.

38
00:02:41,173 --> 00:02:43,596
- Hi, boss.
- Hiya.

39
00:02:44,293 --> 00:02:45,880
Hello, Rebecca.

40
00:02:45,966 --> 00:02:49,564
I have a small favor to ask
regarding our impending wedding.

41
00:02:49,598 --> 00:02:54,186
Since all my close friends
will be out of town,
and we have had a
previous conversation,

42
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:56,688
and our eyes have met on
a number of occasions,

43
00:02:56,722 --> 00:03:01,013
I was wondering if you'd consent
to be my maid of honor.

44
00:03:01,543 --> 00:03:05,113
Me?
Isn't that usually
your best friend?

45
00:03:05,117 --> 00:03:07,332
You are my best friend.

46
00:03:07,332 --> 00:03:09,953
Oh, I'm very flattered.

47
00:03:09,953 --> 00:03:11,439
Um... I guess so.

48
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:13,730
Sure, Lila.
Lilith.

49
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:16,824
Right. Right.
I knew that.

50
00:03:16,858 --> 00:03:19,294
Let's discuss wedding gowns.
Do you think black...

51
00:03:19,328 --> 00:03:23,048
Sam, it, uh, goes without saying
of course, that you'll be
my best man.

52
00:03:23,082 --> 00:03:26,888
Aw, I-I don't want to do that.
It makes me feel
so uncomfortable.

53
00:03:26,888 --> 00:03:29,554
I mean, a best man has
to give a toast, doesn't he?

54
00:03:29,588 --> 00:03:33,175
No, look, I-I took the liberty
of writing down a few things.

55
00:03:33,209 --> 00:03:36,594
Then I'd be honored.
Oh, that's great.

56
00:03:36,628 --> 00:03:38,880
What are you doing
for a bachelor party?

57
00:03:38,914 --> 00:03:40,715
Oh, actually,
I haven't any plans.

58
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:42,901
Well, would you like
to have one tonight?

59
00:03:42,935 --> 00:03:46,320
Well, what do you
think, darling?
Uh, would I like
a bachelor party?

60
00:03:47,422 --> 00:03:50,425
Well... while I feel
that particular ritual

61
00:03:50,425 --> 00:03:53,767
is as passé as taking
the topknot of one's dead enemy,

62
00:03:53,767 --> 00:03:56,067
I will not deprive you
of the experience.

63
00:03:56,067 --> 00:03:57,749
Immature though it might be.

64
00:03:57,749 --> 00:03:59,725
She's a gamer!

65
00:04:01,019 --> 00:04:04,119
We're on!
Fellas, stag party tonight.

66
00:04:04,119 --> 00:04:06,337
Hey! All right.

67
00:04:06,337 --> 00:04:09,166
You know, uh,
being maid of honor

68
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:12,222
means you have
to throw Brunehilda
a bridal shower.

69
00:04:12,256 --> 00:04:15,266
Oh, right.
I guess I should do something.

70
00:04:15,267 --> 00:04:17,402
What kind of shower
do you think?
Kitchen? Linen?

71
00:04:17,436 --> 00:04:21,773
Look at who she's
hitching up with.
Better make it marital aids.

72
00:04:22,241 --> 00:04:24,375
I'll handle this.

73
00:04:24,409 --> 00:04:28,262
Uh, Lilith?
What do you say we have
a little get-together
at my place tonight?

74
00:04:28,297 --> 00:04:29,631
That would be lovely.

75
00:04:29,665 --> 00:04:32,433
Now, you're gonna have
to tell me who to invite,
because I don't know...

76
00:04:32,467 --> 00:04:35,036
anything about you.

77
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:38,856
I only wish there were some way
I could repay you, Rebecca.

78
00:04:38,891 --> 00:04:39,811
Oh, don't mention it.

79
00:04:39,811 --> 00:04:43,211
If you ever need
to admit a family member
to a mental institution,

80
00:04:43,245 --> 00:04:46,013
I could certainly
speed up the paperwork.

81
00:04:48,183 --> 00:04:50,836
That's very dear of you.

82
00:04:52,331 --> 00:04:56,507
Well, gents...
My last night of freedom.

83
00:04:56,542 --> 00:05:00,829
One last chance to...
loosen the old
noose, so to speak.

84
00:05:00,829 --> 00:05:03,814
Really have some fun
while I still can.

85
00:05:03,816 --> 00:05:06,384
Do I hear the pitter-patter
of cold feet?

86
00:05:06,418 --> 00:05:08,431
No! No! Not at all.

87
00:05:08,431 --> 00:05:12,160
I mean, as long as I'm in love
with this woman
and she has my dear old mother
tied up in the cellar,

88
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,911
I'm gonna go through with it.

89
00:05:15,694 --> 00:05:19,355
Darling...
could I speak with you a moment?

90
00:05:19,355 --> 00:05:23,050
Excuse me.
The ball and chain.

91
00:05:25,872 --> 00:05:31,476
Frasier, do you realize that is
the fourth derogatory remark
about marriage
you've made this evening?

92
00:05:31,496 --> 00:05:34,813
Oh, come on, my angel.
I mean, they're...
they're jokes.

93
00:05:34,813 --> 00:05:38,082
I mean, everybody knows
my mother is dead.
That's what makes it funny.

94
00:05:39,635 --> 00:05:42,096
No one loves a good joke
more than I.

95
00:05:42,096 --> 00:05:44,439
But I find that...
as our wedding day approaches...

96
00:05:44,473 --> 00:05:47,325
the frequency of these quips
has increased.

97
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,337
Are you having second thoughts?

98
00:05:49,337 --> 00:05:52,346
Well, only that I
love you more now
than I did five minutes ago.

99
00:05:52,381 --> 00:05:56,388
Leaving aside your
schoolboy sophistries,
let me make you an offer.

100
00:05:56,388 --> 00:05:59,937
If, after your madcap night
of debauchery and vomiting,

101
00:05:59,972 --> 00:06:02,612
you still feel you want to go
through with the wedding plans,

102
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:04,392
call me and tell me so.

103
00:06:04,426 --> 00:06:07,345
But... Lilith,
that's entirely unnecessary.

104
00:06:07,379 --> 00:06:08,823
I beg to differ.

105
00:06:08,823 --> 00:06:14,285
Up until this point,
you've only seen my warm
and vulnerable side.

106
00:06:15,054 --> 00:06:18,238
Now I must become
cold and analytical.

107
00:06:20,209 --> 00:06:23,070
As if you could, my treasure.

108
00:06:23,996 --> 00:06:28,549
Frasier, I need
your reassurance.
I'll be awaiting your call.

109
00:06:30,036 --> 00:06:32,705
Boy, this bachelor party
should be keen.

110
00:06:32,777 --> 00:06:34,466
"Keen"?

111
00:06:34,857 --> 00:06:37,353
Hey, I don't know about Indiana,

112
00:06:37,353 --> 00:06:41,135
but around here
when guys get together
to send another guy
off to his doom,

113
00:06:41,135 --> 00:06:44,002
things can get a little raunchy,
you hear me?

114
00:06:44,166 --> 00:06:48,072
You fellas ever
dress up farm animals
in women's clothing?

115
00:06:51,741 --> 00:06:55,782
- No.
- Well, then I'm one up on you.

116
00:07:02,968 --> 00:07:04,919
Gentlemen!

117
00:07:06,571 --> 00:07:11,331
You know, I,
I was listening
to a rock and roll station
on my way over here,

118
00:07:11,331 --> 00:07:13,547
and... you know, to put me
in the mood.

119
00:07:13,547 --> 00:07:17,365
There was a passage in one
of those tribal songs

120
00:07:17,399 --> 00:07:21,503
that I feel, uh...
well, is the keynote
for this evening.

121
00:07:21,537 --> 00:07:25,067
"Everybody have fun tonight."

122
00:07:25,476 --> 00:07:29,036
"Everybody Wang Chung tonight."

123
00:07:32,781 --> 00:07:35,733
Yeah, I think we got
a madman on our hands here.

124
00:07:35,768 --> 00:07:37,314
I had a nap.

125
00:07:38,137 --> 00:07:41,823
You know, gentlemen I...
I can't tell you how touched
I am that you all...

126
00:07:41,857 --> 00:07:43,591
to a man...
came back for my party.

127
00:07:43,625 --> 00:07:45,643
We never left.

128
00:07:46,328 --> 00:07:48,814
Boy, this is gonna
be some night.

129
00:07:48,814 --> 00:07:51,154
Oh, a real guy night.

130
00:07:51,154 --> 00:07:54,235
Check your X chromosome
at the door.

131
00:07:55,787 --> 00:07:58,472
I wonder what
the women are doing?

132
00:07:58,507 --> 00:08:01,994
Oh, they're probably, uh,
hanging around, drinking
some European coffee

133
00:08:01,994 --> 00:08:04,556
you know, mocha Finland
or the like, eh.

134
00:08:04,914 --> 00:08:08,182
Passing around a bunch
of brownies,
saying, "No, I
really shouldn't,"

135
00:08:08,216 --> 00:08:10,307
and then stuffing their faces.

136
00:08:15,115 --> 00:08:17,277
To the man of the hour, huh?

137
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:21,706
Mr. Frasier Crane,
and to all the girls
we've loved before.

138
00:08:21,706 --> 00:08:23,364
Hear! Hear!

139
00:08:23,398 --> 00:08:26,513
I've, uh...
loved quite a few.
How 'bout a fill-up, huh?

140
00:08:26,513 --> 00:08:29,522
Cliffie.
A big difference between
loving women

141
00:08:29,522 --> 00:08:32,181
and annoying them
in the checkout line, okay?

142
00:08:33,309 --> 00:08:36,610
Ah, women.
They're tough to figure out.

143
00:08:36,645 --> 00:08:40,393
Yeah, but they're
sure fun to play with
while you're trying.

144
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:43,110
If you guys could
have one woman,

145
00:08:43,135 --> 00:08:45,419
any woman in the world,
who would it be?

146
00:08:45,454 --> 00:08:49,122
Oh, that's easy.
Kathleen Turner.

147
00:08:51,059 --> 00:08:53,845
<i>Give me Kim Basinger
in 9 1/2 Weeks.</i>

148
00:08:53,879 --> 00:08:55,851
Ten weeks. Ten weeks.

149
00:08:56,031 --> 00:08:58,186
Jill Eikenberry.

150
00:08:58,186 --> 00:09:01,886
<i>You know, L.A. Law?
She's married to that short,
dumpy guy on the show.</i>

151
00:09:01,888 --> 00:09:04,426
Something about her, I like.

152
00:09:05,657 --> 00:09:07,778
Lilith Sternin.

153
00:09:10,779 --> 00:09:12,046
Loni Anderson.

154
00:09:12,081 --> 00:09:15,783
Boy, she's got a set of oompahs
that John Phillip Sousa
would kill for.

155
00:09:23,066 --> 00:09:26,312
I swear to God.
My very first time
was in the sixth grade.

156
00:09:26,312 --> 00:09:28,448
School crossing guard.

157
00:09:28,981 --> 00:09:30,908
No! Hey, I swear to you.

158
00:09:30,908 --> 00:09:33,250
Wow, that's more exciting
than my first time.

159
00:09:33,285 --> 00:09:34,722
Wedding night, Norm?

160
00:09:34,722 --> 00:09:37,162
Uh, the following week.

161
00:09:38,341 --> 00:09:40,007
Hey, hey, good news, guys.

162
00:09:40,041 --> 00:09:42,660
Wife says I don't have to go
home till midnight.

163
00:09:42,695 --> 00:09:46,166
Ooh, yeah. The bad news is,
she'll still be awake
when you get there.

164
00:09:46,702 --> 00:09:48,512
Eh, I don't know. Women, women.

165
00:09:48,512 --> 00:09:52,120
You know, uh, once they get
their claws in you,
they just don't let go,
you know what I mean?

166
00:09:52,154 --> 00:09:54,388
Oh, I don't know, Cliff.
I wouldn't say that
about all women.

167
00:09:54,423 --> 00:09:56,925
I'm sure Loni Anderson
doesn't do that.

168
00:09:57,309 --> 00:09:58,753
And I know my Lilith.

169
00:09:58,753 --> 00:10:02,647
Why, just today, she presented
me with an opportunity
to back out of the marriage
if I so desire.

170
00:10:02,681 --> 00:10:05,065
Now, is that blind faith or what?

171
00:10:06,201 --> 00:10:07,769
Uh-oh, what?

172
00:10:07,803 --> 00:10:11,352
Seems to me that
she might have changed her mind
and is just trying
to let you down easy.

173
00:10:11,352 --> 00:10:13,608
That's the most preposterous
thing I've ever heard.

174
00:10:13,642 --> 00:10:17,562
Oh, I don't know, now.
If you had a 200-pound marlin,
and you're about haul him
on the boat,

175
00:10:17,596 --> 00:10:21,290
would you stop and ask him if he
wanted to go back in the water?

176
00:10:22,317 --> 00:10:25,006
Be careful, Dr. Crane.
This could be a trick question.

177
00:10:25,006 --> 00:10:28,156
I think the laws are
different in each state.

178
00:10:29,934 --> 00:10:33,411
Well, I-I certainly
don't believe
that's true in Lilith's case.

179
00:10:33,445 --> 00:10:35,976
I don't know, Frase, Sammy
could have a point there.

180
00:10:36,899 --> 00:10:40,034
Do you really think Lilith
wants me to back out?

181
00:10:40,068 --> 00:10:43,072
Could be. Could be.
I'd think about it, Doc.

182
00:10:43,153 --> 00:10:45,681
Well, then let's just see
how the night progresses.

183
00:10:45,681 --> 00:10:47,757
Maybe Lilith Sternin will
get her wish, after all.

184
00:10:47,757 --> 00:10:49,498
Where's that stripper?

185
00:10:50,411 --> 00:10:54,503
Let's get Bubbles or Peaches,
or whatever her name is
out here and have at her!

186
00:10:56,918 --> 00:11:00,302
No, you, uh,
you stay right there. Yeah.

187
00:11:19,174 --> 00:11:21,853
We are amused.

188
00:11:43,284 --> 00:11:45,585
- Karen!
- Dr. Crane!

189
00:11:45,585 --> 00:11:48,903
- You know each other?
- She's one of my patients.

190
00:11:54,108 --> 00:11:56,638
Karen, I hope you're doing
this for the money,

191
00:11:56,638 --> 00:11:59,714
because this certainly
won't square things
between you and your father.

192
00:12:12,545 --> 00:12:14,416
I'm sorry I spoiled your party.

193
00:12:14,416 --> 00:12:16,720
Oh, nonsense, Karen, you
didn't spoil anything.

194
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:20,633
And under the circumstances,
we understand, don't we, guys?

195
00:12:23,756 --> 00:12:25,373
There, you see?

196
00:12:25,408 --> 00:12:29,476
- Well, bye-bye, now.
- Bye-bye.

197
00:12:32,148 --> 00:12:34,116
Maybe I shouldn't get married.

198
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:36,637
Oh, come on,
what are you talking about?

199
00:12:36,637 --> 00:12:40,355
Oh, it's time I realized
that there are
two Frasier Cranes.

200
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:43,174
Frasier the prospective groom
who sent Karen on her way,

201
00:12:43,209 --> 00:12:46,501
and Frasier the pig who wanted
to see her shake her nonnies.

202
00:12:47,521 --> 00:12:49,893
You know, I've never revealed
this to anybody,

203
00:12:49,893 --> 00:12:52,216
but when Diane left me
at the altar, I...

204
00:12:52,216 --> 00:12:56,662
well, there was
a tiny voice that kept saying,
"You're off the hook,
you're off the hook."

205
00:12:56,662 --> 00:13:01,923
Yeah, the only voice
I heard was Vera's
just yapping and yapping.

206
00:13:01,923 --> 00:13:04,880
You ever notice
it's always the women
who want to get married?

207
00:13:04,914 --> 00:13:07,649
Yapping and yapping.

208
00:13:07,683 --> 00:13:11,565
Well, you know, when I think
of all the unhappy people
whom I've counseled
over the years,

209
00:13:11,565 --> 00:13:17,209
whose lives
have been scarred and destroyed
by marriages badly cast,

210
00:13:17,243 --> 00:13:19,244
I could write a book.

211
00:13:19,278 --> 00:13:21,865
I have written a book.

212
00:13:21,865 --> 00:13:25,494
Come on, now, Fras.
You're just having
last-minute jitters.

213
00:13:25,494 --> 00:13:29,631
Geez, I-I don't know.
Maybe Lilith
isn't the woman for me.

214
00:13:30,256 --> 00:13:32,524
What do you think of her, guys?

215
00:13:32,559 --> 00:13:36,794
Tell me, listen, I-I-I demand...
complete honesty.

216
00:13:36,829 --> 00:13:40,075
Well, uh, Doc,
I'll be honest with you.

217
00:13:40,075 --> 00:13:42,174
Uh, ixnay, ixnay.

218
00:13:42,174 --> 00:13:46,405
Oh, no, Normie, no,
I just wish
that I was there for you.

219
00:13:52,928 --> 00:13:56,098
I was, uh,
waiting for you
to wise up, there, Doc.

220
00:13:56,132 --> 00:13:57,694
You know, I mean,
Lilith Sternin...

221
00:13:57,694 --> 00:14:02,618
I mean, even the name
makes the old butt cheeks,
uh, tighten up,
you know what I mean?

222
00:14:03,139 --> 00:14:06,953
I mean, she is Olive Oyl
without the good fashion sense.

223
00:14:06,953 --> 00:14:08,938
And that personality, geez...

224
00:14:08,938 --> 00:14:10,646
Hey, whoa, whoa, come on,
hey, Cliff, that's enough.

225
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:13,040
Yeah, you think so? Yeah, yeah.

226
00:14:14,267 --> 00:14:16,775
Sam, you know, you've been
uncharacteristically mute.

227
00:14:16,775 --> 00:14:18,570
I mean, surely you have
some opinion on this.

228
00:14:18,605 --> 00:14:20,233
No, no, do it, man.

229
00:14:20,233 --> 00:14:23,129
I think you should
walk off together
into the sunset, you know?

230
00:14:23,129 --> 00:14:24,621
Live happily ever after.

231
00:14:24,621 --> 00:14:27,312
Translation: Frasier Crane,
you're a complete fool
if you get married.

232
00:14:27,346 --> 00:14:28,680
I did not say that.

233
00:14:28,715 --> 00:14:30,432
Now, listen, Sam, I know
exactly what you're thinking.

234
00:14:30,466 --> 00:14:33,585
I mean, every fiber of
your body speaks it.
You live it every day.

235
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:37,307
Give me one good reason
why the single life
is better than being married.

236
00:14:37,707 --> 00:14:40,670
Okay, uh... well, let's see.

237
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:43,381
When I get home, I don't
have to explain to anybody

238
00:14:43,381 --> 00:14:45,361
uh, where I've been
or what I've been doing.

239
00:14:45,361 --> 00:14:50,101
If I was out having a good time,
I don't have to call home
to see if I can stay later.

240
00:14:50,135 --> 00:14:51,999
Oh, that reminds me.

241
00:14:52,071 --> 00:14:54,406
There, right there.

242
00:14:54,406 --> 00:14:57,492
There you go.
See, that's
what you're losing, man...
your freedom.

243
00:14:57,526 --> 00:15:00,879
You know, I can eat doughnuts
for dinner if I want to.

244
00:15:00,914 --> 00:15:03,631
Nobody nags me
to put down the toilet seat.

245
00:15:03,666 --> 00:15:06,102
I am the king
of my own remote control.

246
00:15:06,102 --> 00:15:09,965
I can date anybody I want to,
and if somebody better
turns up...

247
00:15:09,965 --> 00:15:11,871
and somebody always does,
bless their hearts...

248
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:13,875
then I can date them
the very next night.

249
00:15:13,875 --> 00:15:15,977
You know, I don't have to worry
about forgetting an anniversary,

250
00:15:16,011 --> 00:15:19,268
no mother-in-laws,
no father-in-laws,

251
00:15:19,268 --> 00:15:21,349
no laws, period.

252
00:15:21,384 --> 00:15:24,085
I only asked for one reason.

253
00:15:24,629 --> 00:15:26,354
My God.

254
00:15:26,389 --> 00:15:29,374
- I'm, I'm actually
beginning to have doubts.
- No.

255
00:15:29,408 --> 00:15:33,324
You know, I've got to hear
the voice of my beloved
just to reassure me.

256
00:15:33,324 --> 00:15:37,265
Uh, Woody, Woody, give
me Rebecca's number,
and hand me the phone,
would you?

257
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:41,670
Oh, Dr. Crane,
if Miss Howe answers,
could you ask her something
for me?

258
00:15:41,704 --> 00:15:45,852
- What's that, Wood?
- Ask her if she has Prince Albert
in a can.

259
00:15:46,776 --> 00:15:49,568
- Don't tell her it was me.
- No.

260
00:15:52,749 --> 00:15:55,600
Hello.
Yeah, h-hello.

261
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,785
Is that you, Carla?

262
00:15:56,819 --> 00:15:58,401
Yeah, yeah, who is it?

263
00:15:58,401 --> 00:16:01,990
Uh, it's Frasier.
What's all that noise?
What's going on over there?

264
00:16:02,024 --> 00:16:04,676
We're making a quilt.

265
00:16:04,711 --> 00:16:06,761
Well, can I speak to Lilith,
please?

266
00:16:06,795 --> 00:16:07,829
Well, is it important?

267
00:16:07,863 --> 00:16:11,065
She's showing the male stripper
where to put his things.

268
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:12,367
What?

269
00:16:12,402 --> 00:16:14,653
Oh, I-I got to get back.

270
00:16:14,687 --> 00:16:18,356
I-I got a bet
this guy's packing socks.

271
00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:23,578
She'll call you back sometime.

272
00:16:26,782 --> 00:16:28,317
What happened?

273
00:16:28,351 --> 00:16:30,319
Oh, nothing.

274
00:16:30,353 --> 00:16:32,454
Seems Lilith
is indisposed at the moment.

275
00:16:32,488 --> 00:16:34,722
She's helping to undress
a male stripper.

276
00:16:36,458 --> 00:16:38,610
A male stripper?

277
00:16:38,644 --> 00:16:41,245
Well, where do they put
the tassels?

278
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:48,086
The thought of my Lilith
having one last carnal fling

279
00:16:48,121 --> 00:16:51,156
with some fellow in a Speedo
is beyond belief!

280
00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:52,207
Now, Frasier, I mean,

281
00:16:52,242 --> 00:16:53,803
just 'cause some guy
strips in her honor

282
00:16:53,809 --> 00:16:56,345
doesn't mean they're going
to wind up in the sack together.

283
00:16:56,379 --> 00:16:58,413
Oh, no, no, no,
you don't know my Lilith.

284
00:16:58,448 --> 00:16:59,731
I'll tell you,
once her libido's cut loose,

285
00:16:59,766 --> 00:17:01,550
I mean, there's no tying
her down, unless, of course,

286
00:17:01,584 --> 00:17:03,104
that's what she's into
for the evening.

287
00:17:04,487 --> 00:17:06,321
She's, right now,
she's with him.

288
00:17:06,355 --> 00:17:09,024
Oh, no, hey, hey, come
on, take it easy here.

289
00:17:09,058 --> 00:17:11,793
She's with that man...
that sweating, chiseled,

290
00:17:11,828 --> 00:17:13,795
Frasier. Pulsing, throbbing...

291
00:17:13,830 --> 00:17:15,413
Hey, hey, whoa. Sexy...

292
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:23,221
Creme de Menthe?

293
00:17:24,623 --> 00:17:27,509
You couldn't find some water?

294
00:17:30,362 --> 00:17:32,397
My God, Sam.

295
00:17:32,432 --> 00:17:37,168
You realize what this...
this means?

296
00:17:37,202 --> 00:17:39,388
Well, I-I don't know
the clinical term for it,

297
00:17:39,422 --> 00:17:40,922
but it seems to me

298
00:17:40,956 --> 00:17:42,791
you were going
a little scooters there.

299
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,461
I was jealous, Sam.

300
00:17:46,496 --> 00:17:49,130
I-I was insanely,
blindly jealous.

301
00:17:49,165 --> 00:17:53,134
If ever I needed a clearer
gut-level demonstration

302
00:17:53,169 --> 00:17:56,004
of my feelings,
I mean, that was it.

303
00:17:56,038 --> 00:17:57,872
Yes, yes, it's perverted.

304
00:17:57,907 --> 00:18:01,509
Yes, it's childish,
but yes, it's love.

305
00:18:01,543 --> 00:18:03,762
Maybe you ought
to go see her right now.

306
00:18:03,796 --> 00:18:05,163
I will, Sam.

307
00:18:05,197 --> 00:18:07,716
There's just one matter that
has to be rectified first.

308
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:11,753
Cliff, in light
of my recent decision,

309
00:18:11,788 --> 00:18:17,058
I now take offense at your
remarks about Lilith.

310
00:18:17,092 --> 00:18:20,395
In short, I'm going
to kick your sorry butt.

311
00:18:22,198 --> 00:18:24,266
Ah, now, come on, Doc,
just cool down, will you?

312
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:25,733
It was just a joke.

313
00:18:25,768 --> 00:18:28,370
Oh, you mean like that costume
you wear every day?

314
00:18:28,404 --> 00:18:30,455
Whoa!

315
00:18:33,643 --> 00:18:35,877
All right, put up your dukes,
Dr. Cream Puff.

316
00:18:35,911 --> 00:18:37,671
Okay, now we got a party, eh?

317
00:18:38,797 --> 00:18:41,032
All right, all right,
uh, before we start,

318
00:18:41,066 --> 00:18:42,500
let's just, uh,

319
00:18:42,535 --> 00:18:44,185
set a few ground rules,
all right?

320
00:18:44,954 --> 00:18:46,121
Uh, no punching in the face

321
00:18:46,155 --> 00:18:48,272
because that can cause
severe brain damage.

322
00:18:49,541 --> 00:18:51,526
Oh, oh, all right, uh,
just one other thing.

323
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:53,194
Uh, no hitting below the belt.

324
00:18:53,229 --> 00:18:54,913
I'm about to be married.

325
00:18:54,947 --> 00:18:57,015
Uh, all right, all right,
fair enough, fair enough.

326
00:19:01,149 --> 00:19:02,230
All right, well, no hitting

327
00:19:02,255 --> 00:19:03,738
in the, uh,
right shoulder, though.

328
00:19:03,773 --> 00:19:05,206
That's my bag shoulder,
all right?

329
00:19:12,381 --> 00:19:16,050
What about the, um,
upper thigh area?

330
00:19:16,085 --> 00:19:17,619
Uh...

331
00:19:17,653 --> 00:19:20,371
Oh, no, I think we covered that
on page five over here.

332
00:19:20,406 --> 00:19:21,973
Yeah.

333
00:19:22,008 --> 00:19:23,742
Well, then, where
does that leave us?

334
00:19:23,776 --> 00:19:25,076
I don't know; It's leaving me

335
00:19:25,111 --> 00:19:26,978
with writer's cramp,
I'll tell you.

336
00:19:27,012 --> 00:19:28,813
Well, let that be
a lesson to you.

337
00:19:32,268 --> 00:19:34,235
As for me,

338
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:35,704
I'm going to go back
to my beloved,

339
00:19:35,738 --> 00:19:37,739
throw my arms around
her milky-white shoulders,

340
00:19:37,774 --> 00:19:39,374
and let me tell you
something, fellas.

341
00:19:39,408 --> 00:19:41,143
I'm going to tell her
I'm devoted to her,

342
00:19:41,177 --> 00:19:43,444
and that I'm dedicating
the rest of my life to her.

343
00:19:44,814 --> 00:19:46,280
Hello, everyone.

344
00:19:47,066 --> 00:19:48,517
Frasier, is that you?

345
00:19:48,551 --> 00:19:52,086
Good. I hope this doesn't spoil
the bachelor party,

346
00:19:52,121 --> 00:19:53,955
but the engagement is off.

347
00:19:53,989 --> 00:19:55,474
It's over, history,

348
00:19:55,508 --> 00:19:57,275
<i>kaput. Good night.</i>

349
00:19:57,310 --> 00:19:57,943
What?!

350
00:19:57,977 --> 00:19:59,211
She's kind of juiced.

351
00:19:59,245 --> 00:20:01,279
I can't be engaged
to you, Frasier,

352
00:20:01,314 --> 00:20:03,281
because I'm marrying Randy here.

353
00:20:04,634 --> 00:20:06,734
If anyone wants to get us
a wedding gift,

354
00:20:06,769 --> 00:20:09,304
his butt is this size.

355
00:20:13,609 --> 00:20:15,677
Why don't you sit down,
Dr. Sternin?

356
00:20:15,712 --> 00:20:18,513
Oh, "Dr. Sternin"
is a little formal, isn't it?

357
00:20:18,547 --> 00:20:24,419
You can call me Sheena,
Ruler of the Jungle of Love.

358
00:20:24,453 --> 00:20:25,736
Can somebody sober her up?

359
00:20:25,771 --> 00:20:27,132
Hey, I think you lost a button.

360
00:20:33,079 --> 00:20:35,497
We'll handle it from here.
Thanks, Randy.

361
00:20:35,531 --> 00:20:37,815
Happy to do it. There's still
the matter of cab fare.

362
00:20:37,850 --> 00:20:40,134
Oh. Here, there you go.

363
00:20:40,169 --> 00:20:41,670
Great. Thanks.

364
00:20:41,704 --> 00:20:43,238
See you.

365
00:20:45,207 --> 00:20:46,574
Oh, Randy, don't leave me.

366
00:20:47,893 --> 00:20:51,629
I'll never be able
to hear "Shock the Monkey" again

367
00:20:51,663 --> 00:20:53,497
without crying.

368
00:20:58,171 --> 00:20:59,504
Lilith,

369
00:20:59,538 --> 00:21:01,072
what were you thinking of?!

370
00:21:01,106 --> 00:21:03,274
I'm sorry, Frasier,
it's just that I felt the need

371
00:21:03,308 --> 00:21:04,709
to get back at you.

372
00:21:04,743 --> 00:21:06,461
I waited all evening
for you to call

373
00:21:06,495 --> 00:21:08,095
and say that the wedding
was still on,

374
00:21:08,130 --> 00:21:09,230
but you didn't, you cur.

375
00:21:09,264 --> 00:21:10,414
I did call!

376
00:21:10,449 --> 00:21:12,050
Didn't Carla tell you?

377
00:21:12,084 --> 00:21:15,620
She was too busy licking
Bosco off Randy's chest.

378
00:21:17,656 --> 00:21:20,275
I became increasingly more
distraught and foolish

379
00:21:20,309 --> 00:21:21,576
as the night grew long.

380
00:21:21,611 --> 00:21:24,379
Of course, the 11 tequila
shooters didn't help.

381
00:21:24,413 --> 00:21:27,431
And now, the epilogue
is that my behavior

382
00:21:27,466 --> 00:21:31,052
has probably cost me
the one man I truly love.

383
00:21:31,087 --> 00:21:33,455
Oh, you can probably
still catch him.

384
00:21:35,574 --> 00:21:36,908
Woody, I don't think

385
00:21:36,942 --> 00:21:39,811
you're following along
closely enough.

386
00:21:39,845 --> 00:21:41,296
Listen, you're not the only one

387
00:21:41,330 --> 00:21:44,666
who's behaved
irrationally tonight.

388
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:48,336
Lilith... I want
to marry you anyway.

389
00:21:49,955 --> 00:21:51,089
You do?

390
00:21:51,123 --> 00:21:52,440
Absolutely.

391
00:21:52,474 --> 00:21:54,625
For the rest of my life,

392
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:57,762
I will always
cherish those words:

393
00:21:57,796 --> 00:22:01,266
"Lilith, I want to
marry you anyway."

394
00:22:03,452 --> 00:22:04,686
Come, my sweet.

395
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:07,689
Let's get on
with our life together.

396
00:22:07,723 --> 00:22:09,123
Uh, thank you all.

397
00:22:09,158 --> 00:22:10,392
Yeah, way to go, Doc.

398
00:22:10,426 --> 00:22:11,526
Good night, Doc. See you, Doc.

399
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:13,327
Oh, Lilith, just, uh...

400
00:22:13,362 --> 00:22:14,996
promise me two things.

401
00:22:15,030 --> 00:22:17,765
Never leave me for
another, and uh...

402
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:20,201
don't throw up on me in the cab.

403
00:22:25,157 --> 00:22:26,991
Well, guys, what do you think?

404
00:22:27,025 --> 00:22:28,526
What'll we do now, huh?

405
00:22:28,561 --> 00:22:29,661
I got to get home.

406
00:22:29,695 --> 00:22:31,862
Yeah, I got
to tell my wife, too.

407
00:22:31,897 --> 00:22:33,114
Yeah, I'm out of here, too.

408
00:22:33,148 --> 00:22:34,349
Me, too. Good night, Sam.

409
00:22:34,383 --> 00:22:35,617
Good night, Sam. Yeah.

410
00:22:35,651 --> 00:22:36,384
Hey, that reminds me.

411
00:22:36,418 --> 00:22:38,269
I promised Vera
I'd pick up some Chinese food.

412
00:22:38,304 --> 00:22:39,654
Oh, that's nice of you, Norm.

413
00:22:39,689 --> 00:22:41,809
Well, I spilled it on the floor
this morning.

414
00:22:46,629 --> 00:22:47,912
Yeah, well,

415
00:22:47,947 --> 00:22:49,998
I'll be saying
good night there, Sammy.

416
00:22:50,032 --> 00:22:52,601
I, uh, I am married
to the U.S. Postal Service.

417
00:22:52,635 --> 00:22:53,802
What the hell, Sammy,

418
00:22:53,836 --> 00:22:55,871
we all can't lead
your carefree life.

419
00:22:55,905 --> 00:22:57,746
Well, good night. Yeah.

420
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:03,861
Oh, boy.

421
00:23:10,269 --> 00:23:12,020
Party's over? Yeah.

422
00:23:12,054 --> 00:23:15,823
They all had women
they had to run home to. Saps.

423
00:23:15,858 --> 00:23:18,075
I just came back to lock up.

424
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:19,910
Oh, come on,
hey, I always do that.

425
00:23:19,945 --> 00:23:20,762
Oh, that's right.

426
00:23:20,796 --> 00:23:23,114
You're a real night owl,
aren't you?

427
00:23:23,148 --> 00:23:25,366
Yeah. One of the great joys
of being single.

428
00:23:25,401 --> 00:23:26,701
You don't have to tell me.

429
00:23:26,735 --> 00:23:28,253
Those women at the shower...

430
00:23:28,287 --> 00:23:30,121
they have no idea
how to have fun.

431
00:23:30,156 --> 00:23:33,491
Five minutes after Randy left,
we got into this heated debate

432
00:23:33,525 --> 00:23:36,294
about which was better,
mayonnaise or Miracle Whip.

433
00:23:36,329 --> 00:23:37,963
Turned into a fistfight.

434
00:23:37,997 --> 00:23:40,165
Ha!

435
00:23:40,199 --> 00:23:41,082
Ah, that's pathetic.

436
00:23:41,116 --> 00:23:42,917
Boy, you know, I'll never
trade in the single life.

437
00:23:42,952 --> 00:23:43,935
Me, neither.

438
00:23:44,053 --> 00:23:46,254
Good night, Sam.
Yeah, good night.

439
00:23:51,026 --> 00:23:53,094
Ah.

440
00:23:53,128 --> 00:23:54,095
Freedom.

441
00:23:56,098 --> 00:23:57,778
You want to go get
a cup of coffee?

442
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:59,984
Oh, you bet I do.
