1
00:00:00,765 --> 00:00:05,191
>>> AND NOW IT'S TIME FOR
CHURCH CHAT.

2
00:00:08,856 --> 00:00:11,902
>> THANK YOU.
THANK YOU, AND WELCOME TO
CHURCH CHAT.

3
00:00:11,902 --> 00:00:13,878
I'M THE CHURCH LADY.

4
00:00:14,579 --> 00:00:17,907
THANK YOU.
SO SWEET, SO SWEET.

5
00:00:17,907 --> 00:00:22,764
YOU KNOW, IT'S GREAT TO BE BACK
TO RING OUT THE END OF 2024.

6
00:00:22,764 --> 00:00:25,909
THE MOST SATANIC YEAR IN
HISTORY.

7
00:00:25,909 --> 00:00:27,577
INSTEAD OF MOTHER MARY,

8
00:00:27,577 --> 00:00:31,013
LITTLE GIRLS ARE LOOKING UP TO THE
HOPTOEE GIRL.

9
00:00:31,013 --> 00:00:33,974
YOU KNOW WHAT I SAY?
INSTEAD OF HOPTOEE

10
00:00:33,974 --> 00:00:36,978
YOU NEED TO
WALKTOEE A CHURCH.

11
00:00:37,646 --> 00:00:40,136
HAVE YOU SEEN "WICKED"?

12
00:00:41,787 --> 00:00:43,983
YEAH, JUST LIKE "THE WIZARD OF OZ",

13
00:00:43,983 --> 00:00:48,117
BUT INSTEAD OF SAYING
LIONS, TIGERS AND BEARS, OH MY,

14
00:00:48,117 --> 00:00:51,890
THEY SAY LIONS, TIGERS, AND
SLUTS, OH YES!

15
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:53,776
A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT.

16
00:00:53,776 --> 00:00:56,063
EVERYWHERE YOU LOOK, YOU'VE GOT
11-YEAR-OLDS

17
00:00:56,063 --> 00:00:59,091
DRESSING UP LIKE
THAT VIXEN, SABRINA CARPENTER.

18
00:00:59,091 --> 00:01:01,453
YOU KNOW WHO WAS THE BEST
CARPENTER?

19
00:01:01,453 --> 00:01:03,465
JESUS.

20
00:01:03,796 --> 00:01:06,402
¶ HE'S WORKING LATE'

21
00:01:06,402 --> 00:01:09,647
CAUSE HE'S A SAVIOR ¶

22
00:01:11,714 --> 00:01:15,100
NOW IT'S TIME FOR MY FIRST
GUEST.

23
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:19,264
PLEASE WELCOME MATT GAETZ.

24
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:24,411
HELLO, DEAR.
>> THANK YOU.

25
00:01:24,411 --> 00:01:27,078
HELLO, CHURCH LADY.

26
00:01:28,902 --> 00:01:33,005
>> ARE YOU OKAY, MATT?
YOU LOOK A LITTLE SURPRISED TO
BE HERE.

27
00:01:33,005 --> 00:01:37,234
>> NO.
THIS IS JUST HOW MY FACE IS.

28
00:01:38,229 --> 00:01:41,022
>> I CAN SEE THAT.
IT LOOKS LIKE YOUR FOREHEAD'S

29
00:01:41,022 --> 00:01:43,707
TRYING TO GO TO HEAVEN WITHOUT
YOU.

30
00:01:44,524 --> 00:01:47,655
WHAT A -- WHAT A PUSS, WHAT A
PUSS.

31
00:01:47,655 --> 00:01:49,746
I DON'T WANT TO CAUSE ANY HUBBUB,

32
00:01:49,746 --> 00:01:53,191
BUT YOU DO LOOK A LITTLE
LIKE SOMEONE WHO COULD BE --

33
00:01:53,191 --> 00:01:55,423
>> LEONARDO DiCAPRIO?
>> NO, IT'S NOT LEONARDO --

34
00:01:55,423 --> 00:01:56,927
>> BRAD PITT?

35
00:01:56,927 --> 00:02:00,110
>> NO, JUST TRYING TO KNOCK ON
MY NOGGIN.

36
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:03,236
COULD IT BE -- SATAN?

37
00:02:04,332 --> 00:02:06,729
CAUGHT YOU OFF GUARD, DIDN'T I?

38
00:02:06,729 --> 00:02:09,304
NOW MATT, LET'S SEE IF I HAVE
THIS STRAIGHT.

39
00:02:09,304 --> 00:02:13,240
YOU WERE INVOLVED IN SOME LITTLE
SEXUAL PECCADILLOS?

40
00:02:13,251 --> 00:02:14,909
THEY WROTE A WHOLE REPORT ABOUT IT,

41
00:02:14,909 --> 00:02:17,952
BUT SOMEHOW WE NEVER GOT TO
SEE IT, DID WE?

42
00:02:17,952 --> 00:02:20,058
ISN'T THAT CONVENIENT?

43
00:02:20,058 --> 00:02:22,461
>> FOR ME IT IS, YES.

44
00:02:22,461 --> 00:02:24,415
>> POOR LITTLE MATT GAETZ.

45
00:02:24,415 --> 00:02:27,946
YOU BETTER REPENT, MATT.
THERE'S ONLY 17 DAYS LEFT TO
CHRISTMAS.

46
00:02:27,946 --> 00:02:31,056
>> YOU HAD ME AT 17.

47
00:02:32,955 --> 00:02:37,935
>> OKAY, OFF YOU GO.
DON'T LET THE DOOR HIT YOU ON
THE FOREHEAD ON YOUR WAY OUT.

48
00:02:37,935 --> 00:02:41,231
GOOD-BYE, MATT GAETZ, GOOD-BYE.

49
00:02:43,131 --> 00:02:45,611
ALL RIGHT.
MOVING RIGHT ALONG,

50
00:02:45,611 --> 00:02:48,970
MY NEXT
GUEST IS SOMEONE WHO ACTUALLY IS
A LOT LIKE JESUS.

51
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:51,836
BECAUSE HE ALSO HAS A DAD NAMED
JOSEPH.

52
00:02:51,836 --> 00:02:55,863
WHOSE LIFE IS MADE WAY MORE
COMPLICATED BECAUSE OF HIM.

53
00:02:55,863 --> 00:02:59,684
PLEASE WELCOME THE ONE AND ONLY
HUNTER BIDEN.

54
00:03:17,854 --> 00:03:20,016
>> HI, THERE.
CHURCH LADY.

55
00:03:20,016 --> 00:03:22,688
HAVEN'T BEEN HERE IN A WHILE,
I'VE BEEN LAYING LOW A LITTLE
BIT.

56
00:03:22,688 --> 00:03:27,804
>> OH, I THINK THAT'S OKAY.
AT LEAST YOU HAVEN'T BEEN DOING
A PODCAST.

57
00:03:27,804 --> 00:03:30,361
>> EASY, CHURCH WOMAN.

58
00:03:30,361 --> 00:03:33,444
>> OH, HUNTER, IT'S ACTUALLY
CHURCH LADY.

59
00:03:33,444 --> 00:03:36,194
>> OH, WELL PARDON ME.

60
00:03:40,296 --> 00:03:44,529
>> PARDON YOU?
WHO DO YOU THINK I AM, YOUR
DADDY?

61
00:03:44,529 --> 00:03:46,961
>> OH, YES, MY FATHER DID PARDON
ME.

62
00:03:46,961 --> 00:03:50,315
BUT I THOUGHT IT WAS A GOOD
THING FOR THE FATHER TO FORGIVE THE SON,

63
00:03:50,315 --> 00:03:52,319
RIGHT, CHURCH LADY?

64
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:57,333
>> OH.
LAST TIME I CHECKED, JESUS
WASN'T WALKING AROUND IN A ROBE
WITH NO UNDERWEAR,

65
00:03:57,333 --> 00:03:59,665
HANGING OUT
WITH PROSTITUTES.

66
00:03:59,665 --> 00:04:02,264
>> I THINK HE WAS.

67
00:04:08,539 --> 00:04:13,164
>> WELL, JESUS CERTAINLY DIDN'T
TURN WATER INTO CRACK.

68
00:04:13,164 --> 00:04:15,774
>> WAIT, YOU CAN DO THAT?

69
00:04:15,774 --> 00:04:18,311
>> HUNTY, LET'S MOVE ON, OKAY?

70
00:04:18,311 --> 00:04:22,503
BECAUSE YOU KNOW, SOME PEOPLE ON
THE RIGHT AREN'T TOO HAPPY ABOUT
YOUR PARDON.

71
00:04:22,503 --> 00:04:25,410
>> WELL, THEY SINGLED ME OUT
JUST BECAUSE OF WHO I AM.

72
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:28,386
MUCH LIKE TRUMP, THEY WENT AFTER
ME BECAUSE OF MY LAST NAME

73
00:04:28,386 --> 00:04:31,292
AND
ALL THE ILLEGAL THINGS I DID.

74
00:04:32,088 --> 00:04:36,289
>> WELL, ISN'T THAT SPECIAL.

75
00:04:37,746 --> 00:04:40,291
>> CAN I SAY ONE THING BEFORE I
GO?

76
00:04:40,291 --> 00:04:43,400
I'VE GONE THROUGH A LOT, BUT MY
DAD LOVES ME UNCONDITIONALLY

77
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,301
AND THAT'S THE GREATEST GIFT OF ALL.

78
00:04:45,301 --> 00:04:48,682
ALSO, TO ANYONE WHO'S SEEN ANY
OF THOSE LAPTOP PHOTOS,

79
00:04:48,682 --> 00:04:51,717
JUST
REMEMBER, THE CAMERA TAKES OFF
TWO INCHES.

80
00:04:51,717 --> 00:04:55,802
>> ALL RIGHTY, THEN.
BYE-BYE, NOW.
BYE-BYE, NOW.
BYE-BYE.

81
00:04:55,802 --> 00:04:59,209
GO AWAY.
ALL RIGHT.
HUNTER BIDEN, EVERYBODY.

82
00:05:01,523 --> 00:05:06,144
ALL RIGHT.
WELL.
MY NEXT GUEST IS A BASEBALL FREE AGENT

83
00:05:06,144 --> 00:05:09,546
ABOUT TO SIGN THE BIGGEST
CONTRACT IN ALL OF TIME.

84
00:05:09,546 --> 00:05:13,437
PLEASE WELCOME JUAN SOTO.

85
00:05:20,463 --> 00:05:24,247
>> HELLO, CHURCH LADY, OR AS I
LIKE TO SAY --

86
00:05:26,049 --> 00:05:27,556
>> WELCOME TO "CHURCH CHAT."

87
00:05:27,556 --> 00:05:30,267
LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION.
HAVE YOU EVER BEEN TO CHURCH
BEFORE?

88
00:05:30,267 --> 00:05:32,882
>> WELL, I AM LATIN.

89
00:05:32,882 --> 00:05:35,370
WHEN I WAS A KID, WE WENT TO
CHURCH

90
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:37,789
ONCE ON CHRISTMAS,
ONCE ON EASTER,

91
00:05:37,789 --> 00:05:40,949
AND TWICE EVERY OTHER
DAY.

92
00:05:40,949 --> 00:05:46,316
>> WELL, AREN'T YOU A MUSCULAR
MAN WITH A FESTIVE ACCENT.

93
00:05:47,621 --> 00:05:50,027
>> OKAY.

94
00:05:50,027 --> 00:05:53,223
>> I LIKE IT, I CAN'T HELP IT.

95
00:05:53,223 --> 00:05:57,430
>> WELL, MY FAITH IS ACTUALLY A
PART OF MY GAME.

96
00:06:09,593 --> 00:06:12,835
>> WELL, ISN'T THAT SPANISH.

97
00:06:14,936 --> 00:06:19,098
SO I HEAR THEY'RE GOING TO PAY
YOU $700 MILLION

98
00:06:19,098 --> 00:06:22,531
TO SMACK SOME
BALLS AROUND WITH YOUR BIG
STICK.

99
00:06:22,856 --> 00:06:24,977
WE LIKE TO HIT A BASEBALL, DON'T
WE?

100
00:06:24,977 --> 00:06:26,767
MAKE MORE MONEY THAN JESUS.

101
00:06:26,767 --> 00:06:29,097
YOU KNOW, MONEY IS THE ROOT OF
ALL EVIL.

102
00:06:29,208 --> 00:06:32,653
>> HA HA.
WELL, IT'S NOT TRUE, THEN I'M
GOING TO BECOME

103
00:06:32,653 --> 00:06:35,567
THE MOST EVIL
BASEBALL PLAYER IN THE WORLD.

104
00:06:35,567 --> 00:06:38,945
>> OH, SO FUNNY.
YOU MIGHT AS WELL TELL US,

105
00:06:38,945 --> 00:06:41,714
WHAT
TEAM DO YOU THINK YOU'RE GOING
TO PICK?

106
00:06:41,714 --> 00:06:43,893
>> YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW.

107
00:06:43,893 --> 00:06:47,166
RIGHT NOW, I HOPE THE YANKEES
MAKE ME THE BEST OFFER.

108
00:06:47,166 --> 00:06:50,063
>> WELL, AS A CHRISTIAN, I HAVE TO ASK YOU --

109
00:06:50,063 --> 00:06:52,687
WHY NOT SPEND YOUR
TIME HELPING --

110
00:06:52,687 --> 00:06:55,657
AND MONEY
HELPING THE NEEDY AND THE LESS
FORTUNATE?

111
00:06:55,657 --> 00:06:59,970
>> YOU'RE RIGHT.
MAYBE I SIGN WITH THE METS.

112
00:07:06,367 --> 00:07:07,885
>> WELL, THAT'S TERRIFIC.

113
00:07:07,885 --> 00:07:10,167
YOU KNOW WHAT?
IT'S TIME FOR MY SONG.

114
00:07:10,167 --> 00:07:12,439
COME ON OUT, "CHURCH CHAT" SINGERS,

115
00:07:12,439 --> 00:07:16,120
COME OUT, DON'T BE SHY.
HERE WE GO.

116
00:07:18,213 --> 00:07:20,942
¶ SATAN HAD A GOOD YEAR ¶

117
00:07:20,942 --> 00:07:24,539
¶ WITH HOPTOEE AND P. DIDDY ¶

118
00:07:24,539 --> 00:07:27,586
¶ SATAN IS A REAL KIND OF
GIDDY ¶

119
00:07:27,586 --> 00:07:30,525
¶ SATAN HAD A GOOD YEAR ¶

120
00:07:30,525 --> 00:07:34,599
¶ WILL CHRISTMAS BE ABOUT JESUS

121
00:07:34,599 --> 00:07:36,748
NOBODY KNOWS ¶

122
00:07:36,748 --> 00:07:40,195
¶ OR WILL IT BE ABOUT SANTA

123
00:07:40,195 --> 00:07:43,494
HANGING WITH THE ¶
¶ HO HO HO ¶

124
00:07:43,494 --> 00:07:52,481
¶ SATAN HAD A GOOD YEAR ¶¶

125
00:07:54,341 --> 00:07:56,923
LET'S DANCE!

126
00:08:02,379 --> 00:08:06,874
>> LIVE FROM NEW YORK, IT'S
SATURDAY NIGHT!

127
00:10:27,116 --> 00:10:31,726
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN -- PAUL
MESCAL!

128
00:10:49,965 --> 00:10:53,786
>>> THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK
YOU VERY MUCH.

129
00:10:53,786 --> 00:10:58,019
I'M PAUL MESCAL, AND IT IS GREAT
TO BE HERE.

130
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:02,610
I'VE ALWAYS LOVED "SNL"

131
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:04,704
THIS PLACE HAS SUCH HISTORY.

132
00:11:04,704 --> 00:11:09,170
AND GROWING UP BACK HOME, I
NEVER IMAGINED I'D BE STANDING
HERE.

133
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:13,230
I'M ALSO EXCITED TO BE HERE
BECAUSE I'M NOT REALLY KNOWN FOR
COMEDY.

134
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:15,362
WHICH IS CRAZY TO ME.

135
00:11:15,362 --> 00:11:18,579
BECAUSE I THINK I'VE GIVEN A LOT
OF REALLY FUNNY PERFORMANCES,

136
00:11:18,579 --> 00:11:20,945
AND I THINK WE HAVE SOME
HIGHLIGHTS HERE.

137
00:11:21,115 --> 00:11:22,843
>> SORRY.

138
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:47,238
>> I MEAN, IT'S FUNNY, NO?

139
00:11:47,238 --> 00:11:51,812
BUT I THINK IT'S PRETTY CLEAR
I'M NOT AFRAID TO DO EMOTIONAL SCENES

140
00:11:51,812 --> 00:11:53,436
OR NUDE SCENES

141
00:11:53,436 --> 00:11:56,595
OR NUDE EMOTIONAL SCENES.

142
00:11:56,595 --> 00:12:01,732
RECENTLY I DID PIVOT TO
SOMETHING NEW IN "GLADIATOR 2."

143
00:12:03,564 --> 00:12:06,862
IT'S A BIG ACTION-PACKED
BLOCKBUSTER.

144
00:12:06,862 --> 00:12:08,269
HERE'S A LOOK.

145
00:12:18,565 --> 00:12:22,526
IT'S SAFE TO SAY THERE'S NOT A
LOT OF COMEDY ON THE RESUME.

146
00:12:22,526 --> 00:12:27,840
ANYWAY, I DO TAKE GREAT PRIDE IN
BEING IRISH.

147
00:12:28,494 --> 00:12:31,639
AND THE IRISH PEOPLE HAVE BEEN
THROUGH A LOT.

148
00:12:31,639 --> 00:12:34,125
CENTURIES OF BRITISH OCCUPATION.

149
00:12:34,125 --> 00:12:36,879
THE GREAT FAMINE.
MASS EMIGRATION.

150
00:12:36,879 --> 00:12:40,936
THAT U2 ALBUM THAT AUTOMATICALLY
GOT DOWNLOADED.

151
00:12:40,936 --> 00:12:44,690
SO BEFORE WE START THE SHOW, I
JUST WANT TO CLEAR UP

152
00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:46,951
SOME UGLY
STEREOTYPES ABOUT THE IRISH.

153
00:12:46,951 --> 00:12:50,221
FOR EXAMPLE, THERE'S A NASTY RUMOR

154
00:12:50,221 --> 00:12:52,595
THAT IRISH PEOPLE HAVE SEX
WITH OUR COUSINS, RIGHT?

155
00:12:52,595 --> 00:12:55,110
THAT'S OFFENSIVE, AND IT'S
RIDICULOUS.

156
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:57,880
WE HAVE SEX WITH OUR SECOND
COUSINS.

157
00:12:58,077 --> 00:13:02,239
PEOPLE ALSO THINK THE IRISH HATE
BRITISH PEOPLE.

158
00:13:02,239 --> 00:13:05,660
THAT'S NOT TRUE, WE JUST DON'T
CONSIDER THEM PEOPLE.

159
00:13:06,047 --> 00:13:09,096
AND SOMETIMES PEOPLE ASK ME IF I
THINK

160
00:13:09,096 --> 00:13:11,523
NOTRE DAME'S MASCOT THE
FIGHTING IRISH IS OFFENSIVE.

161
00:13:11,523 --> 00:13:13,729
NOT AT ALL.
WE DO THE SAME THING WITH THE
AMERICANS.

162
00:13:13,729 --> 00:13:18,653
MY HIGH SCHOOL'S MASCOT WAS THE
FIGHTING FAT-ASSES.

163
00:13:20,481 --> 00:13:24,636
A LOT OF PEOPLE ASK IF WE WEAR
KILTS.
NO, THAT'S THE SCOTTISH.

164
00:13:24,636 --> 00:13:29,082
TRADITIONALLY, THE IRISH WEAR
SHORT-SHORTS.

165
00:13:30,691 --> 00:13:34,362
>> DID SOMEONE SAY SHORT-SHORTS?

166
00:13:34,362 --> 00:13:36,028
HI

167
00:13:36,028 --> 00:13:37,072
>> WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

168
00:13:37,072 --> 00:13:40,407
>> TRYING TO BE LIKE YOU, MAN.
YOU LIKE WHEN YOU SEE, HUH?

169
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:44,972
>> ABSOLUTELY NOT.

170
00:13:44,972 --> 00:13:46,976
BY THE WAY, THOSE ARE WAY TOO
SHORT.

171
00:13:46,976 --> 00:13:49,085
>> WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY,
PAUL.

172
00:13:49,085 --> 00:13:52,218
THE SHORTER THE SHORTS, THE
TALLER YOU LOOK.

173
00:13:52,431 --> 00:13:55,036
>> DON'T THINK IT'S WORKING,
BUD.

174
00:13:55,036 --> 00:13:56,966
>> AGREE TO DISAGREE, MY
BROTHER.

175
00:13:56,966 --> 00:14:00,612
GOOD-BYE, PAUL.
GOOD-BYE, AMERICA.

176
00:14:01,641 --> 00:14:05,099
BYE

177
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:09,534
>> YOU KNOW, PEOPLE OFTEN TALK
ABOUT THE LUCK OF THE IRISH.

178
00:14:09,534 --> 00:14:11,683
AND TONIGHT, I HAVE TO SAY,

179
00:14:11,683 --> 00:14:15,411
I DO FEEL VERY, VERY LUCKY TO BE
HERE.

180
00:14:15,411 --> 00:14:19,088
I'M IN NEW YORK CITY.
I'M HOSTING "SNL."

181
00:14:19,088 --> 00:14:22,190
AND THIS FEELS TOTALLY, TOTALLY
INSANE TO ME.

182
00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:25,572
WE HAVE A GREAT SHOW TONIGHT.
SHABOOZEY IS HERE.

183
00:14:25,572 --> 00:14:29,079
SO STICK AROUND, AND WE'LL BE
RIGHT BACK!

184
00:15:11,877 --> 00:15:18,883
AND HE SAID, "YOU KNOW YOU'RE AT

185
00:15:18,885 --> 00:15:19,917
CHIPOTLE, RIGHT?"

186
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:21,252
>> THIS CHICKEN IS DELICIOUS,

187
00:15:21,254 --> 00:15:21,519
MOM.

188
00:15:21,521 --> 00:15:23,254
I REALLY MISSED YOUR COOKING.

189
00:15:23,256 --> 00:15:25,590
>> AND WE REALLY MISSED YOU.

190
00:15:25,592 --> 00:15:27,058
>> COLLEGE HAS REALLY DONE YOU

191
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:27,458
WELL, SON.

192
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:28,426
>> I LOVE YOU GUYS.

193
00:15:28,428 --> 00:15:30,862
>> SWEETHEART?

194
00:15:30,864 --> 00:15:31,829
YOU KNOW THE RULES.

195
00:15:31,831 --> 00:15:32,597
NO HATS AT THE TABLE.

196
00:15:32,599 --> 00:15:38,936
>> RIGHT, SORRY.

197
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:39,737
>> HONEY?

198
00:15:39,739 --> 00:15:41,506
YOU GOT SOMETHING ON YOUR EAR.

199
00:15:41,508 --> 00:15:47,145
>> OH, YEAH, GOT MY EAR PIERCED.

200
00:15:47,547 --> 00:15:49,681
>> STEVEN, DO SOMETHING.

201
00:15:49,683 --> 00:15:52,417
>> SORRY, BUT FOR A SECOND I

202
00:15:52,419 --> 00:15:53,685
THOUGHT YOU HEARD YOU SAY YOU

203
00:15:53,687 --> 00:15:54,585
GOT YOUR EAR PIERCED.

204
00:15:54,587 --> 00:15:55,553
>> I DID, YEAH.

205
00:15:55,555 --> 00:15:57,055
>> LIKE AS A JOKE?

206
00:15:57,057 --> 00:15:58,456
IS THIS SUPPOSED TO BE A JOKE?

207
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:00,425
>> NO, I JUST THOUGHT IT LOOKED

208
00:16:00,427 --> 00:16:02,593
GOOD, WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?

209
00:16:02,595 --> 00:16:03,961
>> WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?

210
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:04,729
LET ME ANSWER THAT QUESTION WITH

211
00:16:04,731 --> 00:16:07,231
ANOTHER QUESTION.

212
00:16:07,233 --> 00:16:09,133
WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL IF I CAME

213
00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:11,469
HOME ONE DAY WITH SKELETON HANDS

214
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:13,504
TATTOOED AROUND MY NECK!

215
00:16:13,907 --> 00:16:15,773
>> YEAH, WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?

216
00:16:15,775 --> 00:16:17,642
MAYBE I'LL SHOW UP TO WORK

217
00:16:17,644 --> 00:16:18,509

218
00:16:18,511 --> 00:16:20,712

220
00:16:22,415 --> 00:16:22,780
MAN."

221
00:16:22,782 --> 00:16:24,649
>> IT'S AN EARRING, MOST PEOPLE

222
00:16:24,651 --> 00:16:25,850
THINK THEY'RE, LIKE, COOL.

WE'RE BEING COOL?

225
00:16:29,322 --> 00:16:31,723
HEY, I WANT TO BE COOL.

226
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:35,059

THINK THIS MAKES ME GAY?

238
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:53,978
I'M NOT BY THE WAY, BUT YOU'RE

245
00:17:05,759 --> 00:17:06,157
HOMOPHOBIC?

246
00:17:06,159 --> 00:17:08,760

YOUR LINE?

493
00:26:13,723 --> 00:26:16,056
>> NO, I'M SORRY, I JUST THOUGHT

YOU ARE A GREAT ACTOR.

THESE THINGS HAPPEN.

558
00:27:54,824 --> 00:27:56,023
AND YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY.

559
00:27:56,025 --> 00:27:58,358
THIS TOO SHALL "PASTA."

560
00:27:58,360 --> 00:27:59,126
>> I WILL SMACK YOU RIGHT IN THE

561
00:27:59,128 --> 00:27:59,560
FACE.

562
00:28:00,329 --> 00:28:02,830

>> IS THERE SOMEBODY TALKING

565
00:28:04,767 --> 00:28:05,065
PASTA?

566
00:28:05,067 --> 00:28:07,301

569
00:28:09,572 --> 00:28:10,571
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

570
00:28:10,573 --> 00:28:13,307
IT'S ME, MARIO CAPINELLI.

571
00:28:13,309 --> 00:28:14,608
NOW, I'VE BEEN WATCHING YOU TWOS

572
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:15,809
FROM THE BACK.

573
00:28:15,811 --> 00:28:18,312
YOU KNOW, WHEN I WAS A LITTLE

574
00:28:18,314 --> 00:28:19,880
BOY, BACK IN FAR SAN MARTINO, MY

575
00:28:19,882 --> 00:28:21,048
NONA WOULD SPEND ALL DAY MAKING

576
00:28:21,050 --> 00:28:24,084
THE MOST WONDERFUL PASTAS.

577
00:28:24,086 --> 00:28:26,420
WHEN THE PASTA WAS JUST

578
00:28:26,422 --> 00:28:27,788
PERFECTO, SHE WOULD TURN TO ME

579
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:30,691
AND SAY, "MARIO --

580
00:28:30,693 --> 00:28:31,425
SPAGHETTI OR NOT, WE'RE GOING TO

581
00:28:31,427 --> 00:28:31,992
KILL YOU."

582
00:28:31,994 --> 00:28:32,693
AND I WOULD CUT ON MY SUN

583
00:28:32,695 --> 00:28:33,694
SUNGLASSES AND I'D SAY, "PASTA

584
00:28:33,696 --> 00:28:34,762
LA VISTA, BABY."

585
00:28:36,832 --> 00:28:37,531
WHO IS THE MAN WHO JUST SAID

586
00:28:37,533 --> 00:28:38,332
THIS?

587
00:28:38,334 --> 00:28:39,032
WHO IS THIS MAN WHO HAS BEEN

588
00:28:39,034 --> 00:28:39,500
TOUCHED BY GOD?

589
00:28:39,502 --> 00:28:42,469
>> THAT'S ME.

590
00:28:42,471 --> 00:28:42,803
I DID.

591
00:28:42,805 --> 00:28:45,439
>> THEN YOU, MY FRIEND, ARE A

592
00:28:45,441 --> 00:28:45,773
GENIUS.

593
00:28:45,775 --> 00:28:47,174
KEEP IT ON!

594
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:47,708
>> WELL, I AM JUST

PASTA-TIVELY DELIGHTED!

596
00:28:49,779 --> 00:28:50,144
>> DON'T.

597
00:28:57,620 --> 00:29:00,570
PAUL

598
00:29:00,570 --> 00:29:04,712
I WISH HE'D
CRUSH MY HEAD LIKE A WATERMELON
BETWEEN HIS TWO GORGEOUS THIGHS.

599
00:29:04,713 --> 00:29:06,097
SO

600
00:29:06,097 --> 00:29:08,784
>> YEAH, MY GIRLFRIEND IS
HILARIOUS.

601
00:29:08,784 --> 00:29:11,553
THIS IS SO FUN, MAN.
YOU'RE SO DOWN TO EARTH.

602
00:29:11,553 --> 00:29:13,852
A LOT OF TIMES WHEN SERIOUS ACTORS HOST,

603
00:29:13,852 --> 00:29:15,852
THEY CAN BE KIND OF
A LOT.

604
00:29:15,852 --> 00:29:19,245
>> NO, I GET IT.
ACTORS, WE CAN BE AN EMOTIONAL
BUNCH.

605
00:29:19,245 --> 00:29:23,065
I DON'T KNOW, I'M JUST -- I'M
JUST TRYING TO KEEP IT LOW-KEY
THIS WEEK.

606
00:29:23,133 --> 00:29:26,577
>> YEAH, DUDE, WE'RE PUMPED.
WE'RE HUGE FANS, WE LOVE YOU.

607
00:29:26,577 --> 00:29:28,534

608
00:29:33,647 --> 00:29:34,630
WOW.

>> TOTALLY.
ANYWAY, WE HAVE SOME SKETCH
IDEAS --

610
00:29:38,411 --> 00:29:40,641

611
00:29:41,939 --> 00:29:43,507
>> GREAT, YEAH.

612
00:29:43,507 --> 00:29:46,269
>> SORRY, I DIDN'T MEAN TO MAKE
THAT WEIRD OR ANYTHING.

613
00:29:46,269 --> 00:29:48,272
>> NO.
>> NO.

614
00:29:48,272 --> 00:29:51,250
>> I LOVE YOU GUYS.

615
00:29:53,003 --> 00:29:55,416
I THINK I'M IN LOVE WITH YOU.

00:29:55,416 --> 00:29:57,475
>> WE LOVE YOU TOO.

617
00:29:57,475 --> 00:30:00,402
BUT WE DID HAVE SOME SKETCHES WE
WANTED TO PITCH YOU.

618
00:30:00,402 --> 00:30:02,188
>> YEAH, YEAH, NO, DEFINITELY.

619
00:30:02,188 --> 00:30:05,434
I BET YOU GUYS ARE COOKING UP
SOMETHING GOOD, HUH?

620
00:30:06,449 --> 00:30:08,575
>> NO ONE WILL EVER HURT YOU
WHEN I'M AROUND.

621
00:30:08,575 --> 00:30:09,839
>> WHAT'S GOING ON, BROTHER?

622
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:11,452
GREAT

623
00:30:11,452 --> 00:30:14,958
>> MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT, MAYBE WE
SHOULD MOVE IN TOGETHER.

624
00:30:14,958 --> 00:30:16,052
>> DID WE SAY THAT?

625
00:30:16,052 --> 00:30:18,950
>> WHAT IS THIS, MAN?
IS THIS A SEX THING?

626
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:21,613
>> WHAT?
COME ON.

627
00:30:21,690 --> 00:30:23,860
IN TIME, MAYBE, YES.

628
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:25,983
>> YOU WANT TO HAVE SEX WITH
THAT?

629
00:30:25,983 --> 00:30:28,042
YOU'RE BETTER OFF ASKING MY
GIRLFRIEND, BUDDY.

630
00:30:28,042 --> 00:30:29,891
>> IT'S OKAY, IT'S OKAY.

631
00:30:29,891 --> 00:30:33,757
PAUL, I THINK GENUINELY MAYBE GO
MEET WITH OTHER WRITERS OR
SOMETHING.

632
00:30:33,757 --> 00:30:37,559
>> YOU'RE RIGHT.
I SHOULD JUST GO.

633
00:30:38,266 --> 00:30:40,090
>> WHAT WAS THAT?

634
00:30:40,090 --> 00:30:41,664
>> WHAT IF I JUST STAYED?

635
00:30:41,664 --> 00:30:44,862
>> I WOULD JUST GO, PROBABLY.

636
00:30:44,862 --> 00:30:48,920
>> WE COULD BUILD A LIFE
TOGETHER.
I CAN SEE IT SO CLEARLY.

637
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:53,108
THE FOUR OF US IN OUR PERFECT
LITTLE CABIN.

638
00:30:53,108 --> 00:30:56,606
LOOK, BOYS, IT'S SNOWING.

639
00:30:56,606 --> 00:30:59,203
>> WOW!

640
00:30:59,575 --> 00:31:02,481
>> IT WOULD BE SIMPLE.

641
00:31:02,481 --> 00:31:04,134
I'D PROTECT YOU.

642
00:31:04,134 --> 00:31:06,462

AND YOU, YOU'D TEACH ME WHAT
LIFE'S REALLY ABOUT.

651
00:31:29,770 --> 00:31:33,594
SURE, I'LL HAVE TO LEAVE FOR
WORK SOMETIMES.

652

>> PAUL?
WHY DO PEOPLE HATE?

661
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:08,080

LIKE WE DO.

662
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:10,051

>> YEAH, LIKE HE STILL HAD LIFE

750
00:35:57,673 --> 00:35:58,672
IN HIM, BUT IT WASN'T WORTH

751
00:35:58,674 --> 00:35:59,739
GIVING HIM FIVE DAYS' RATIONS OF

752
00:35:59,741 --> 00:36:00,440
SALTED PORK.

JUST BECAUSE WE'RE AT SEA

758
00:36:08,450 --> 00:36:09,649
DOESN'T MEAN THERE ISN'T TIME

759

FOR ROMANCE.

760
00:36:11,687 --> 00:36:15,455

THE HECK OUT OF HERE, MISTER.

903
00:43:04,745 --> 00:43:08,883
THAT A GUY WAS
MURDERED IN COLD BLOOD AND THE
TWO MAIN REACTIONS WERE,

00:43:08,883 --> 00:43:11,155
"YEAH,
WELL HEALTH CARE STINKS."

905

HOT."

THREE BLOCKS
FROM HERE IN BROAD DAYLIGHT,

SEARCH.

00:47:25,737 --> 00:47:30,402
AND HE LEAPT ONTO THE
BEAR'S BACK SHOUTING, "FINISH
HER!"

968
00:47:31,811 --> 00:47:34,138
>> ALL RIGHT, LOOK, BEFORE I
TELL THIS NEXT JOKE,

969
00:47:34,138 --> 00:47:37,781
I JUST WANT
EVERYBODY TO KNOW THAT IT MIGHT
NOT BE FUNNY,

970
00:47:37,781 --> 00:47:41,003
BUT IT IS
OBJECTIVELY A VERY SMART JOKE.

971
00:47:41,003 --> 00:47:44,510
SO IF YOU DON'T LAUGH, IT MEANS
YOU'RE DUMB.

972
00:47:44,510 --> 00:47:46,635
OKAY, HERE IT IS.

973
00:47:46,635 --> 00:47:51,830
NATIONAL PRETEND TO BE A TIME
TRAVELER DAY WAS TOMORROW.

974
00:47:52,650 --> 00:47:55,479
THANK

975
00:47:58,143 --> 00:48:00,530
>> OH, MY GOD.
>> THANK YOU.

976
00:48:00,530 --> 00:48:04,367
>>> NEW RESEARCH SUGGESTS THAT
52% OF PEOPLE

977
00:48:04,367 --> 00:48:06,226
VISITING THEIR
FAMILIES FOR THE HOLIDAY

978
00:48:06,226 --> 00:48:09,044
PLAN TO
HAVE SEX IN THEIR CHILDHOOD
HOME.

979
00:48:09,044 --> 00:48:13,165
EXCELLENT, SAID ELF ON THE
SHELF.

980
00:48:17,362 --> 00:48:20,052
>> OH, MAN, YOU NASTY.

981
00:48:20,052 --> 00:48:24,665
>>> POLICE IN AUSTRALIA ARRESTED
13 PEOPLE AFTER THEIR BOAT BROKE DOWN

982
00:48:24,665 --> 00:48:28,211
AND MORE THAN TWO TONS OF
COCAINE WAS DISCOVERED ON BOARD.

983
00:48:28,211 --> 00:48:32,449
BECAUSE SOMETIMES WHEN YOU HAVE
TOO MUCH COKE, YOUR DINGHY STOPS
WORKING.

984
00:48:34,277 --> 00:48:37,845
THAT'S A -- THAT'S NOT A SMART
JOKE.

985
00:48:38,015 --> 00:48:40,579
>> THIS IS.
SCIENTISTS...

986
00:48:40,579 --> 00:48:45,400
>>> SCIENTISTS HAVE USED
HIGH-SPEED VIDEO TO STUDY HOW
THE SQUIRTING CUCUMBER

987
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:47,888
EXPLOSIVELY SHOOTS OUT ITS
SEEDS.

988
00:48:47,888 --> 00:48:51,236
REACHED FOR COMMENT, SCIENTISTS
QUICKLY CLOSED THEIR LAPTOPS

989
00:48:51,236 --> 00:48:53,629
AND
SHOUTED, "DON'T COME IN HERE."

990
00:48:55,834 --> 00:49:01,631
MY BIGGER QUESTION IS WHY THE
SQUIRTING CUCUMBER SOUNDS LIKE
THIS.

991
00:49:08,580 --> 00:49:11,579
>>> WE'RE ALMOST THROUGH THE
REGULAR SEASON OF THE NFL,

992
00:49:11,579 --> 00:49:13,994
AND
MANY NEW STARS HAVE EMERGED IN
THE LEAGUE.

993
00:49:13,994 --> 00:49:16,758
HERE TO TALK ABOUT NAVIGATING
OVERNIGHT SUCCESS

994
00:49:16,758 --> 00:49:19,788
IS A MOM WHOSE
SON JUST GOT FAMOUS.

995
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:27,083
>> HI, BODIE.
HI, MELISSA.

996
00:49:27,083 --> 00:49:28,662
>> IT'S MAYLISSA.

997
00:49:28,662 --> 00:49:32,446
THIS JOKE ABOUT CUCUMBERS
SQUIRTING?

998
00:49:32,446 --> 00:49:34,636
Y'ALL ARE WRONG FOR THAT.

999
00:49:34,636 --> 00:49:37,495
>> BODIE, YOU SIGNED A PRETTY
BIG CONTRACT WITH THE PANTHERS.

1000
00:49:37,495 --> 00:49:39,239
>> YES, SIR.
GOD IS GOOD.

1001
00:49:39,239 --> 00:49:42,168
>> GOD IS GREAT, Y'ALL.

1002
00:49:42,236 --> 00:49:44,479
OKAY.
SO THIS IS BALMAINE.

1003
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:48,229
UGLIES
I'M SCOOTING IN LOUBOUTIN.

1004
00:49:48,951 --> 00:49:50,843
THANK YOU.

1005
00:49:50,843 --> 00:49:56,548
THINKING OF, WHERE'S THE
CHANGING ROOM FOR SHABOOZEY?
BECAUSE I'M ABOUT TO GET LAID.

1006
00:49:56,548 --> 00:50:00,066
I AM LOVING THIS LIFE.
>> IT SOUNDS LIKE IT.

1007
00:50:00,066 --> 00:50:02,562
IMAGINE HAVING A SON IN THE NFL
COMES WITH A PRICE?

1008
00:50:02,562 --> 00:50:05,523
>> YES.
IT WAS A SACRIFICE.

1009
00:50:05,523 --> 00:50:08,050
MY SON COMMITTED HIMSELF TO THIS SO HARD,

1010
00:50:08,050 --> 00:50:10,967
HE HAD TO SACRIFICE
HAVING A PERSONALITY.

1011
00:50:11,231 --> 00:50:13,817
>> TRUST THE PROCESS.

1012
00:50:14,463 --> 00:50:17,391
>> THAT'S RIGHT, BABY.
NOTHING BEHIND THOSE EYES.

1013
00:50:17,391 --> 00:50:19,984
BUT MY BABY'S A BALLER.

1014
00:50:19,984 --> 00:50:22,255
LOOK AT THE VIP BRACELET.

1015
00:50:22,255 --> 00:50:26,480
I'M ABOUT TO SHOW SHABOOZEY MY
SHAPOOTSY, OKAY?

1016
00:50:26,545 --> 00:50:30,216
TRUST THAT PROCESS.

1017
00:50:30,216 --> 00:50:33,790
>> COOL.
BODIE --

1018
00:50:34,723 --> 00:50:38,598
I HEARD YOU HAVE AN EXCITING
OPPORTUNITY COMING UP?

1019
00:50:38,598 --> 00:50:41,656
>> YEAH, I'M DOING A COMMERCIAL,
ALL PRAISE TO THE LORD.

1020
00:50:41,656 --> 00:50:49,361
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

1021
00:50:49,363 --> 00:50:49,662
OKAY.

1022
00:50:49,664 --> 00:50:50,329
THAT'S MY BABY.

1023
00:50:50,331 --> 00:50:51,597
YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE NEW FACE

1024
00:50:51,599 --> 00:50:53,799
OF CRAZY BREAD, ALL RIGHT?

1025
00:50:53,801 --> 00:50:55,468
LITTLE CAESAR'S, Y'ALL.

1026
00:50:55,470 --> 00:50:57,002
SAY YOUR BIG LINE.

1027
00:50:57,004 --> 00:51:01,040
>> PIZZA COMMA PIZZA.

1028
00:51:01,442 --> 00:51:03,042
>> DON'T SAY THE COMMA, BABY, WE

1029
00:51:03,044 --> 00:51:04,109
TALKED ABOUT THIS.

1030
00:51:04,111 --> 00:51:06,078
>> PIZZA NO COMMA PIZZA.

1031
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:07,513
>> CLOSE ENOUGH.

1032
00:51:07,515 --> 00:51:09,081
Y'ALL, MONEY IS FALLING OUT THE

1033
00:51:09,083 --> 00:51:12,651
SKY, OKAY?

1034
00:51:12,653 --> 00:51:14,453
MAMA KELSEY, STEP ASIDE, THERE'S

1035
00:51:14,455 --> 00:51:17,923
A NEW MAMA IN TOWN, MAMA DOOKIE.

1036
00:51:17,925 --> 00:51:19,492
>> YOUR LAST NAME IS DOOKIE?

1037
00:51:19,494 --> 00:51:20,326
>> YES.

1038
00:51:20,328 --> 00:51:22,628
MY SECOND HUSBAND'S NAME WAS

1039
00:51:22,630 --> 00:51:24,830
DOOKIE, DeVONTE DOOKIE, RIGHT

1040
00:51:24,832 --> 00:51:28,501
TACKLE FOR THE FALCONS, DIED OF

1041
00:51:28,503 --> 00:51:28,801
IBS.

1042
00:51:28,803 --> 00:51:31,136
>> I MISS YOU, DADDY DOOKIE.

1043
00:51:31,138 --> 00:51:33,606
>> BUT I'M SURE Y'ALL WANT TO

1044
00:51:33,608 --> 00:51:35,474
GET YOUR HEADLINE.

1045
00:51:35,476 --> 00:51:37,009
WHO IS MAMA DOOKIE DATING NOW?

1046
00:51:37,011 --> 00:51:37,643
>> NOBODY IS ASKING THAT.

1047
00:51:40,147 --> 00:51:42,548
>> YES, I WAS SPOTTED AT

1048
00:51:42,550 --> 00:51:45,217
EINSTEIN BROTHERS BAGELS WITH

1049
00:51:45,219 --> 00:51:47,953
MANNY FROM "MODERN FAMILY."

1050
00:51:47,955 --> 00:51:48,387
OH, SHUT UP.

1051
00:51:48,389 --> 00:51:50,723
HE'S 27, Y'ALL.

1052
00:51:50,725 --> 00:51:54,026
>> TRUST THE PROCESS.

1053
00:51:54,428 --> 00:51:55,528
>> YOU KNOW, NOT TO BE RUDE,

1054
00:51:55,530 --> 00:51:56,195
SOME PEOPLE SHOULDN'T EVER

1055
00:51:56,197 --> 00:51:57,763
BECOME RICH.

1056
00:52:02,169 --> 00:52:02,501
>> WHAT?

1057
00:52:02,503 --> 00:52:05,204
WHY IS THE CAMERA ON ME?

1058
00:52:05,206 --> 00:52:06,906
>> BODIE, THE AVERAGE NFL CAREER

1059
00:52:06,908 --> 00:52:07,873
IS THREE YEARS.

1060
00:52:07,875 --> 00:52:09,575
THINGS ARE GOOD FOR YOU NOW, BUT

1061
00:52:09,577 --> 00:52:11,577
WHAT WILL YOU DO IF ALL THIS

1062
00:52:11,579 --> 00:52:12,311
COMES TO AN END?

1063
00:52:12,313 --> 00:52:14,380
>> LET'S JUST SAY I MIGHT NEED

1064
00:52:14,382 --> 00:52:16,015
TO MAKE ANOTHER SHABABY.

1065
00:52:16,017 --> 00:52:20,019
BUT SERIOUSLY, BABY, WHAT DO WE

1066
00:52:20,021 --> 00:52:20,686
ALWAYS SAY?

1067
00:52:20,688 --> 00:52:21,820
>> WE -- ARE -- DOOKIES.

1068
00:52:21,822 --> 00:52:24,590
>> THAT'S WHAT YOU SAY?

1069
00:52:24,592 --> 00:52:26,592
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

1070
00:52:26,594 --> 00:52:27,860
WE -- ARE -- DOOKIES.

1071
00:52:27,862 --> 00:52:29,261
WE DO NOT CRUMBLE.

1072
00:52:29,664 --> 00:52:31,163
>> EVEN WHEN YOU PUT THE SQUEEZE

1073
00:52:31,165 --> 00:52:32,498
ON US, WE STAY SOLID DOOKIES.

1074
00:52:35,836 --> 00:52:36,569
>> THE DOOKIE FAMILY, EVERYBODY.

1075
00:52:39,907 --> 00:52:42,207
>> HEY, SHABOOZEY!

1076
00:52:42,209 --> 00:52:54,870

YOU FEELING?

1078
00:53:11,188 --> 00:53:12,254
A LITTLE NERVOUS?

1079
00:53:12,256 --> 00:53:12,888
>> YES.

1080
00:53:12,890 --> 00:53:13,956
VERY NERVOUS.

1081
00:53:13,958 --> 00:53:15,157
YOU HAVEN'T ARGUED MY CASE AT

1082
00:53:15,159 --> 00:53:15,424
ALL.

1083
00:53:15,426 --> 00:53:16,725
THE ONLY THING YOU HAVE DONE IS

1084
00:53:16,727 --> 00:53:18,494
TOLD ME TO WEAR THIS INSANE

1085
00:53:18,496 --> 00:53:19,328
OUTFIT TODAY.

1086
00:53:19,330 --> 00:53:19,595
WHY?

1087
00:53:19,597 --> 00:53:20,729
>> RELAX.

1088
00:53:20,731 --> 00:53:21,630
I HAVE A PLAN.

1089
00:53:21,632 --> 00:53:22,298
IT WILL ALL MAKE SENSE IN A

1090
00:53:22,300 --> 00:53:26,568
MOMENT.

1091
00:53:26,570 --> 00:53:27,336
>> ALL RISE.

1092
00:53:27,338 --> 00:53:29,071
I NOW CALL THIS COURT BACK IN

1093
00:53:29,073 --> 00:53:29,405
SESSION.

1094
00:53:29,407 --> 00:53:30,806
MR. LANDON, WILL THE DEFENSE

1095
00:53:30,808 --> 00:53:32,241
CALL ANY WITNESSES BEFORE YOU

1096
00:53:32,243 --> 00:53:32,541
REST?

1097
00:53:32,543 --> 00:53:34,209
>> YES, YOUR HONOR.

1098
00:53:34,211 --> 00:53:35,811
WE'D LIKE TO CALL THE ONLY

1099
00:53:35,813 --> 00:53:37,279
WITNESS TO THE CRIME MY CLIENT

1100
00:53:37,281 --> 00:53:39,715
IS CHARGED WITH BACK TO THE

1101
00:53:39,717 --> 00:53:40,282

>> OBJECTION, YOUR HONOR.

1104
00:53:43,788 --> 00:53:46,455
THE DEFENSE COULD HAVE

00:53:46,457 --> 00:53:47,189
QUESTIONED MISS SHANE WHEN WE

1106
00:53:47,191 --> 00:53:47,923
CALLED HER TO THE STAND, BUT

1107
00:53:47,925 --> 00:53:48,557
THEY DECLINED.

1108
00:53:48,559 --> 00:53:51,460
>> I'M ALLOWED TO CALL WHOEVER I

1109

WANT.

1110
00:53:51,762 --> 00:53:54,496
YOUR HONOR, I PROMISE, THIS WILL

1111
00:53:54,498 --> 00:53:55,898
ALL MAKE SENSE IN A MOMENT.

1112
00:53:55,900 --> 00:53:57,866
>> WE'LL ALLOW IT.

1113
00:53:57,868 --> 00:53:58,634
COUNSEL, THIS BETTER BE GOOD.

1114

YES?

1118
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:11,547
>> YES, SIR, I DID.

1119
00:54:11,549 --> 00:54:14,817
>> YES, SIR, SHE DID.

1120
00:54:14,819 --> 00:54:16,118
AND YOU SAW THE MAN WHO

1121
00:54:16,120 --> 00:54:17,987
COMMITTED THIS ROBBERY, YES?

1122
00:54:17,989 --> 00:54:18,821
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

1123
00:54:18,823 --> 00:54:19,288
I DID.

1124
00:54:19,290 --> 00:54:22,358
I GOT A REAL GOOD LOOK AT HIM.

BOB, LACEY SHAY FROM BUZZFEED.

1463
01:06:12,119 --> 01:06:15,387
I HAVE TO ASK, DID YOU SLAY THE

1464
01:06:15,389 --> 01:06:17,922
HOUSE DOWN BOOF AND HAVE A BRAT

1465
01:06:17,924 --> 01:06:18,256

01:06:18,258 --> 01:06:18,656

01:06:18,658 --> 01:06:20,658
>> A BRAT SUMMER, DID YOU HAVE A

1468
01:06:20,660 --> 01:06:21,292
BRAT SUMMER?

1469
01:06:21,294 --> 01:06:23,495
>> I MIGHT HAVE HAD A CAREER AND

1470
01:06:23,497 --> 01:06:25,697
A DRINK, PERHAPS A DODGER DODGER

1471

WATCHING SHOHEI OHTANI.

1472
01:06:29,069 --> 01:06:33,104
BUT THAT'S ABOUT IT FOR SAUSAGE

1473
01:06:33,106 --> 01:06:33,538
CONSUMPTION.

1474
01:06:33,540 --> 01:06:35,073
>> BOB, I LOVE THIS GUY!

1475
01:06:35,075 --> 01:06:37,942
>> I LOVE YOU TOO, BUT ALL THIS

1476
01:06:37,944 --> 01:06:39,878
SAUSAGE TALK HAS AWOKEN MY

1477
01:06:39,880 --> 01:06:40,211
HUNGER.

1478

I HEAR THERE'S A HOT BAR AT THE

1479
01:06:43,917 --> 01:06:44,315
END OF THIS.

1480
01:06:44,317 --> 01:06:44,983

WHILE I HAVE THE TWO OF YOU,

1483
01:06:48,655 --> 01:06:50,688

1489
01:07:04,471 --> 01:07:08,473

>> SURE DID, BOB.

1493
01:07:14,681 --> 01:07:16,781
THE VIBES MIGHT BE SMALL BUT THE

1494
01:07:16,783 --> 01:07:19,651
FLAVOR'S AS BIG AS THE AMERICAN

1495
01:07:19,653 --> 01:07:19,984
SPIRIT.

1496
01:07:19,986 --> 01:07:21,519
>> I NEED TO GET BREAKFAST.

1497
01:07:21,521 --> 01:07:23,188
BUZZFEED, I LONG TO SEE THE

1498
01:07:23,190 --> 01:07:24,456
PROMISED LAND.

1499
01:07:24,458 --> 01:07:28,293
>> GUYS, APPETIZERS, AAH!

1500
01:07:28,295 --> 01:07:30,528
>> BRUCE, DO YOU HAVE A FAVORITE

1501
01:07:30,530 --> 01:07:31,496
CHALAMET MOVIE?

1502
01:07:31,498 --> 01:07:33,832
>> I LIKE THAT "WONKA" PICTURE.

1503
01:07:33,834 --> 01:07:36,267
I GREW UP IN A CHOCOLATE FACTORY

1504
01:07:36,269 --> 01:07:36,568
TOWN.

1505
01:07:36,570 --> 01:07:37,902
I REMEMBER THE DAY THEY CLOSED

1506
01:07:37,904 --> 01:07:38,870
IT DOWN.

1507
01:07:38,872 --> 01:07:40,472
POPS CAME HOME DRUNK.

1508
01:07:40,474 --> 01:07:42,874
MAMA RAN OFF WITH AN OOMPA

1509
01:07:42,876 --> 01:07:43,208
LOOMPA.

1510
01:07:43,210 --> 01:07:44,809
BUT OF COURSE, LIKE ALL MY

1511
01:07:44,811 --> 01:07:45,443
STORIES, THAT'S NOT TRUE.

1512
01:07:48,748 --> 01:07:51,216
>> ESE GUYS ARE CRAZY.

1513
01:07:51,218 --> 01:07:52,417
I'M GOING TO GO.

1514
01:07:52,419 --> 01:07:54,586
>> OH-OH, HERE COMES ROCK LEGEND

1515
01:07:54,588 --> 01:07:54,786
BONO.

1516
01:07:54,788 --> 01:07:58,857
>> YOU HAVE TO TRY THE STEER RA

1517
01:07:58,859 --> 01:08:03,962
MAY SUE, IT COMES IN A SHOT

1518
01:08:03,964 --> 01:08:05,530
GLASS AND THEY GIVE YOU A TINY

1519
01:08:05,532 --> 01:08:05,864
SPOON.

1520
01:08:05,866 --> 01:08:07,499
>> YOU'RE TESTING ME LIKE JOB,

1521
01:08:07,501 --> 01:08:08,733
CHRISTIN WILDERNESS.

1522
01:08:08,735 --> 01:08:09,567
>> OKAY.

1523
01:08:09,569 --> 01:08:11,536
WELL, BONO, AS A BUZZFEED

1524
01:08:11,538 --> 01:08:13,538
EMPLOYEE, I LEGALLY HAVE TO ASK,

1525
01:08:13,540 --> 01:08:15,139
DID YOU HAVE A BRAT SUMMER?

1526
01:08:15,141 --> 01:08:18,176
>> I DIDN'T HAVE A BRAT SUMMER.

1527
01:08:18,178 --> 01:08:19,511
I COULD NOT POSSIBLY.

1528
01:08:19,513 --> 01:08:21,246
BECAUSE OF THE SWELTERING HEAT

1529
01:08:21,248 --> 01:08:23,448
BROUGHT ON BY CLIMATE CHANGE.

1530
01:08:23,450 --> 01:08:25,350
WE MUST ACT NOW.

1531
01:08:25,352 --> 01:08:26,651
I JUST SAW A DOCUMENTARY ABOUT

1532
01:08:26,653 --> 01:08:28,987
THE DEVASTATING EFFECTS OF

1533
01:08:28,989 --> 01:08:29,454
GLOBAL WARMING.

1534
01:08:29,456 --> 01:08:33,558
IT WAS CALLED, "HOT FROSTY."

1535
01:08:33,560 --> 01:08:35,393
>> THERE YOU GO, BUZZFEED IS

1536
01:08:35,395 --> 01:08:37,829
MAKING ME ASK ONE MORE QUESTION.

1537
01:08:37,831 --> 01:08:38,596
BASED ON YOUR ANSWERS SO FAR,

1538
01:08:38,598 --> 01:08:39,898
THERE'S NO WAY IT'S GOING TO BE

1539
01:08:39,900 --> 01:08:40,198
GOOD.

1540
01:08:40,200 --> 01:08:42,100
IF YOU HAD TO RANK RORY

1541
01:08:42,102 --> 01:08:45,136
GILMORE'S BOYFRIENDS FROM

1542
01:08:45,138 --> 01:08:46,271
GILMORE GIRLS, WHAT WOULD IT

1543
01:08:46,273 --> 01:08:49,574
BE?

1544
01:08:49,576 --> 01:08:50,508
>>> THANKS TO SHABOOZEY, DANA

1545
01:08:58,384 --> 01:09:08,993
CARVEY, DAVID SPADE, THANK YOU
