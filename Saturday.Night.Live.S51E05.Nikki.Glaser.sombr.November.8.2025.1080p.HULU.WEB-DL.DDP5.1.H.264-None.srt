1
00:00:11,447 --> 00:00:15,704
>>> HELLO.
I'D LIKE TO THANK PRESIDENT
TRUMP FOR HAVING US.

2
00:00:15,803 --> 00:00:20,625
THOSE OF US FROM THE
PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY
ARE
HONORED TO BE HERE TODAY

3
00:00:20,625 --> 00:00:25,384
ALONGSIDE RFK JR. AND DR. OZ.

4
00:00:25,384 --> 00:00:30,112
WE'RE GOING TO DISCUSS LOWERING
THE PRICE OF WEIGHT LOSS DRUGS.

5
00:00:30,112 --> 00:00:32,781
FOR YEARS, MY COMPANY, ELI LILLY,

6
00:00:32,781 --> 00:00:37,792
HAS BEEN AT THE FOREFRONT
OF PROVIDING AMERICANS WITH --

7
00:00:37,792 --> 00:00:40,541
>> OH, NO!

8
00:00:43,461 --> 00:00:46,356
>> OH, HI.
DIDN'T SEE YOU THERE.

9
00:00:46,356 --> 00:00:48,683
SOMEONE WAS DYING IN MY OFFICE.

10
00:00:48,683 --> 00:00:50,757
I THINK I'M PLAYING THIS VERY
NORMAL.

11
00:00:50,757 --> 00:00:54,507
JUST STAND THERE AND STARE LIKE
A SOCIOPATH.

12
00:00:54,507 --> 00:00:56,524
PRETEND LIKE I WAS GOING TO HELP, 

13
00:00:56,524 --> 00:00:59,710
SOMEONE DROPS SOMETHING
AND YOU DO THE FAKE BEND, OH,

14
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:03,768
LET ME HELP YOU PICK THAT UP,
YOU GOT IT

15
00:01:03,768 --> 00:01:09,024
 RFK OUT OF HERE LIKE
SOMEONE WAS TRYING TO GIVE HIM A
VACCINE.

16
00:01:09,024 --> 00:01:11,290
BRAINWORM, TAKE THE WHEEL!

17
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:14,576
THAT THING RATATOUILLE'D HIM OUT
OF THE ROOM.

18
00:01:14,576 --> 00:01:18,263
EACH WEEK, I LIKE TO CREATE A
BIG VISUAL 

19
00:01:18,263 --> 00:01:20,321
THAT SUMS UP HOW
THINGS ARE GOING.

20
00:01:20,321 --> 00:01:23,157
LAST WEEK IT WAS THE DEMOLISHING
OF THE EAST WING.

21
00:01:23,157 --> 00:01:27,108
THIS WEEK IT'S A MEDICAL
PROFESSIONAL ALMOST DYING IN MY OVAL OFFICE

22
00:01:27,108 --> 00:01:29,908
 AT THE MERE THOUGHT
OF CHARGING LESS FOR DRUGS.

23
00:01:29,908 --> 00:01:33,097
MAYBE NEXT WEEK A BALD EAGLE
WILL FALL DEAD OUT OF THE SKY

24
00:01:33,097 --> 00:01:35,328
AND SPLAT RIGHT ON THE WHITE
HOUSE LAWN.

25
00:01:35,328 --> 00:01:39,550
BY LAWN I MEAN BIG OUTDOOR
CONCRETE FLOOR.

26
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:41,415
THERE?

27
00:01:41,415 --> 00:01:44,005
MORE IMPORTANTLY, HOW'S THE
FLOOR?
OKAY?

28
00:01:44,005 --> 00:01:48,810
A GUY COLLAPSING IN THE OVAL
OFFICE, WHO'D HAVE THOUGHT IT
WOULD BE NOT ME.

29
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:53,198
DON'T WORRY, HE'LL BE FINE.
DR. OZ IS ON THE CASE.

30
00:01:53,198 --> 00:01:57,016
ANYWAY, ALL IN ALL A GREAT,
AWESOME WEEK

31
00:01:57,016 --> 00:02:00,149
 EXCEPT FOR
ELECTION.
THE DEMOCRATS WON.

32
00:02:00,149 --> 00:02:04,809
THE LAMESTREAM MEDIA CALLED THE
ELECTIONS A REBUKE OF TRUMP'S
POLICIES.

33
00:02:04,809 --> 00:02:08,868
JOKE'S ON THEM, THEY'RE STEPHEN
MILLER'S POLICIES, I DON'T READ
THAT STUFF.

34
00:02:08,868 --> 00:02:11,505
NO LIKEE READEE.

35
00:02:11,505 --> 00:02:14,216
CAN'T BELIEVE THEY ELECTED
MAMDANI.

36
00:02:14,216 --> 00:02:16,105
WE LIKE TO SAY, MAMDANI.

37
00:02:16,105 --> 00:02:20,221
I'M TORN BECAUSE I LIKE A WINNER
BUT I'M NOT CRAZY ABOUT A
MUSLIM.

38
00:02:20,221 --> 00:02:22,439
MAYBE HE'LL CONVERT.

39
00:02:22,439 --> 00:02:27,256
WE'LL PUT HIM IN LINE BEHIND
URSHA VANCE, AND I HOPE I'M
PRONOUNCING THAT WRONG.

40
00:02:27,256 --> 00:02:29,794
OUR SIDE HAD SOME WINS THIS
WEEK, TOO.

41
00:02:29,794 --> 00:02:32,788
THE SUPREME COURT SAID WE COULD
STOP FEEDING POOR PEOPLE.

42
00:02:32,788 --> 00:02:36,555
YOU CAN DLAP FOR THAT.
S.N.A.P.!

43
00:02:36,555 --> 00:02:38,203
S.N.A.P.!

44
00:02:38,302 --> 00:02:42,342
FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO CAN AFFORD
FOOD, NO, YOU CAN'T.

45
00:02:42,342 --> 00:02:45,099
I PROMISED GROCERY PRICES WOULD
PLUMMET,

46
00:02:45,099 --> 00:02:47,459
 AND THEY DID, THEY
PLUMMETED STRAIGHT UP.

47
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:53,040
PEOPLE ARE SAYING, BUT SIR, HOW
WILL I AFFORD MY THANKSGIVING
TURKEY FOR MY FAMILY?

48
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:57,072
WELL, GOOD NEWS IS YOUR FAMILY'S
NOT COMING BECAUSE ALL THE
PLANES ARE GONE.

49
00:02:57,072 --> 00:03:00,287
WE CALL THAT PROBLEM SOLVING
PROBLEM.

50
00:03:00,287 --> 00:03:05,137
KILLING TWO BIRDS WITH ANOTHER
BIRD.
NOW YOU GOT A BUNCH OF CRAZY
BIRDS.

51
00:03:05,137 --> 00:03:07,835
WE LIKE IT, WE LIKE IT, THAT'S
KIND OF OUR THING.

52
00:03:07,835 --> 00:03:10,137
CAN'T AFFORD FOOD, HAVE SOME
CHEAP OZEMPIC.

53
00:03:10,137 --> 00:03:14,583
NOW YOU'RE NOT HUNGRY AND YOU
GET TO TAKE ONE WEIRD, PAINFUL
POOP A WEEK.

54
00:03:14,583 --> 00:03:17,094
HOW'S IT GOING BACK THERE?
IS HE DEAD?

55
00:03:17,094 --> 00:03:22,322
THEY'RE DOING THE -- THEY GOT
THE LEGS UP, THAT MEANS DEAD IN
CARTOON.

56
00:03:22,322 --> 00:03:25,353
ACTUALLY, DON'T TELL ME IF HE'S
DEAD, I WANT TO BE SURPRISED.

57
00:03:25,353 --> 00:03:27,975
ANYWAY.
GOVERNMENT IS STILL SHUT DOWN.

58
00:03:27,975 --> 00:03:30,763
ALL THANKS TO THE DEMOCRATS AND
SOME REPUBLICANS 

59
00:03:30,763 --> 00:03:32,923
AND ALL
REPUBLICANS AND ME.

60
00:03:32,923 --> 00:03:41,853
PEOPLE SAY, JUST CAVE, DON, GIVE

61
00:03:41,855 --> 00:03:43,422
THE DEMOCRATS WHAT THEY WANT,

62
00:03:43,424 --> 00:03:44,456
END THIS.

63
00:03:44,458 --> 00:03:45,891
I THINK WE'RE GOING TO DRAG IT

64
00:03:45,893 --> 00:03:46,258
OUT.

65
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:46,858
WE'RE GOING TO KEEP THE

66
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:49,161
GOVERNMENT SHUT DOWN.

67
00:03:49,163 --> 00:03:50,529
WE'RE LOOKING INTO PERHAPS

68
00:03:50,531 --> 00:03:51,463
STEALING CHRISTMAS.

69
00:03:51,465 --> 00:03:52,331
WE'LL BE DOING GRINCH.

70
00:03:52,333 --> 00:03:53,398
I LIKE THE GRINCH.

71
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,566
HE'S A GREAT GUY.

72
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:55,834
OUR WIVES ARE FRIENDS.

73
00:03:55,836 --> 00:03:56,835
WE PLAY GOLF SOMETIMES.

74
00:03:56,837 --> 00:03:57,402
IS HE OKAY?

75
00:03:57,404 --> 00:03:58,437
HE'S OKAY, ALL RIGHT.

76
00:03:58,439 --> 00:03:59,571
WELL, IF YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE

77
00:03:59,573 --> 00:04:00,772
HIM TO GET AN MRI, USE THIS,

78
00:04:00,774 --> 00:04:01,340
THIS IS MY PUNCH CARD.

79
00:04:03,477 --> 00:04:05,911
ONE MORE AND THE NEXT ONE'S

80
00:04:05,913 --> 00:04:06,245
FREE.

81
00:04:06,247 --> 00:04:07,512
AND FOR ANYONE WORRIED ABOUT THE

82
00:04:07,514 --> 00:04:08,780
STATE OF THE COUNTRY, I'LL SAY

83
00:04:08,782 --> 00:04:10,515
THE SAME THING I SAID TO MELANIA

84
00:04:10,517 --> 00:04:12,484
WHEN SHE TRIED TO HELP ME DO MY

85
00:04:12,486 --> 00:04:12,784
HAIR.

86
00:04:12,786 --> 00:04:15,520
GO AWAY, WHAT I'M DOING IS VERY

87
00:04:15,522 --> 00:04:16,622
COMPLICATED, AND ONLY I KNOW HOW

88
00:04:16,624 --> 00:04:17,389
TO DO IT.

89
00:04:17,391 --> 00:04:18,090
AND LIVE FROM NEW YORK, IT'S

90
00:04:18,092 --> 00:04:24,796

THANK YOU, THANK YOU SO MUCH.

97
00:07:06,493 --> 00:07:08,460
HI, I AM NIKKI GLASER, AND I AM

98
00:07:08,462 --> 00:07:11,029
SO HAPPY TO BE HERE TONIGHT.

99
00:07:11,031 --> 00:07:13,064
THIS IS TRULY A DREAM COME TRUE.

100
00:07:13,066 --> 00:07:15,133
I LOVE THIS SHOW SO MUCH.

101
00:07:15,135 --> 00:07:17,903
AND HERE I AM IN NEW YORK CITY,

102
00:07:17,905 --> 00:07:18,537
EPSTEIN'S ORIGINAL ISLAND.

103
00:07:20,841 --> 00:07:22,607
OH, IT'S SUCH A SPECIAL NIGHT.

104
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:26,845
I GOT A SPRAY TAN TONIGHT.

105
00:07:28,715 --> 00:07:29,781
THANK YOU, IT DESERVES THAT,

106
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:30,449
THANK YOU.

107
00:07:30,451 --> 00:07:32,117
THERE'S SO MANY PASTY WHITE

108
00:07:32,119 --> 00:07:33,819
GIRLS WHO ARE TERRIFIED TO GET

109
00:07:33,821 --> 00:07:35,887
SPRAY TANS, I'M GOING TO LOOK

110
00:07:35,889 --> 00:07:36,221
ORANGE.

111
00:07:36,223 --> 00:07:37,489
JUST -- BELIEVE ME, I PROMISE

112
00:07:37,491 --> 00:07:39,191
YOU, I PROMISE YOU -- IT'S

113
00:07:39,193 --> 00:07:39,925
BETTER THAN WHAT YOU ARE, OKAY?

114
00:07:42,029 --> 00:07:43,061
DON'T BE SCARED.

115
00:07:43,063 --> 00:07:44,362
THEY'RE ALWAYS LIKE, I'M GOING

116
00:07:44,364 --> 00:07:46,665
TO LOOK LIKE TRUMP!

117
00:07:46,667 --> 00:07:47,866
BITCH, THAT'S WHY HE WON.

118
00:07:48,302 --> 00:07:51,336
YEAH, HE PICKED AN INSANE SHADE.

119
00:07:51,338 --> 00:07:52,571
HE WENT PRETTY DARK.

120
00:07:52,573 --> 00:07:54,573
HE DIDN'T GO KAMALA, BUT HE

121
00:07:54,575 --> 00:07:55,907
PICKED A SHADE THAT HALF OF

122
00:07:55,909 --> 00:07:57,108
AMERICA WAS LIKE, OKAY, WE CAN

123
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:59,811
STILL TELL HE'S WHITE.

124
00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:01,379
SO, I MEAN, IT IS KIND OF INSANE

125
00:08:01,381 --> 00:08:03,014
THAT WHITE PEOPLE CAN JUST PAINT

126
00:08:03,016 --> 00:08:04,015
THEIR SKIN A DIFFERENT COLOR AND

127
00:08:04,017 --> 00:08:04,683
THEY'RE LIKE, THIS IS COOL,

128
00:08:04,685 --> 00:08:07,185
RIGHT?

129
00:08:07,187 --> 00:08:08,787
I FEEL LIKE THAT'S CULTURAL

130
00:08:08,789 --> 00:08:09,221
APPROPRIATION.

131
00:08:09,223 --> 00:08:09,988
I DON'T KNOW.

132
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:12,591
I MEAN, IT'S NOT BLACKFACE, BUT

133
00:08:12,593 --> 00:08:13,158
IT IS GUATEMALAN LEG.

134
00:08:15,295 --> 00:08:16,895
THIS IS NOT MY LEG.

135
00:08:16,897 --> 00:08:21,533
I'M LIKE, OH, MY GOD, ME, I'M

136
00:08:21,535 --> 00:08:23,902
ALWAYS NIKKI, AM I SAYING THAT

137
00:08:23,904 --> 00:08:24,669
RIGHT?

138
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:25,871
I GET SHE'S SPRAY TANS.

139
00:08:25,873 --> 00:08:27,806
I BREATHE THE STUFF IN EVERY

140
00:08:27,808 --> 00:08:28,106
WEEK.

141
00:08:28,108 --> 00:08:28,874
I AM DEFINITELY GOING TO GET

142
00:08:28,876 --> 00:08:30,509
SOME KIND OF RESPIRATORY ILLNESS

143
00:08:30,511 --> 00:08:30,909
FROM IT.

144
00:08:30,911 --> 00:08:33,545
IN 20 YEARS THERE'S GOING TO BE

145
00:08:33,547 --> 00:08:35,514
SOME EPIDEMIC CALLED TAN LUNG.

146
00:08:35,516 --> 00:08:36,581
I REALLY WANT TO BE ON THE

147
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:38,016
COMMERCIALS FOR THE CLASS ACTION

148
00:08:38,018 --> 00:08:38,483
LAWSUIT.

149
00:08:38,485 --> 00:08:39,851
I THINK THAT'S SUCH A GOOD GIG.

150
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:41,486
IT WILL BE SO FUN FOR YOU, TOO.

151
00:08:41,488 --> 00:08:43,321
YOU'LL TURN ON YOUR TV IN THE

152
00:08:43,323 --> 00:08:44,422
MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT AND BE, WHO

153
00:08:44,424 --> 00:08:46,091
IS THAT?

154
00:08:46,093 --> 00:08:49,427
I'LL BE, LIKE, I'M NIKKI GLASER.

155
00:08:49,429 --> 00:08:50,562
YOU MAY RECOGNIZE ME FROM THE

156
00:08:50,564 --> 00:08:51,396
ROAST OF TOM BRADY.

157
00:08:51,398 --> 00:08:52,464
IT WILL BE LIKE ME AND SNOOKI.

158
00:08:52,466 --> 00:08:55,267
THAT'S FUN.

159
00:08:55,269 --> 00:08:59,771
JUST TALKING THROUGH OUR TRACHS,

160
00:08:59,773 --> 00:09:01,506
RFK JUNIOR'ing OUT.

161
00:09:01,508 --> 00:09:03,308
HE'S GOT TAN LUNG.

162
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:04,809
I MEAN, HE'S STAGE 2, I DON'T

163
00:09:04,811 --> 00:09:05,343
KNOW.

164
00:09:05,345 --> 00:09:06,011
I'M NO HEALTH EXPERT, BUT

165
00:09:06,013 --> 00:09:06,611
NOTWITHSTANDINGER IS HE.

166
00:09:09,816 --> 00:09:11,249
IT'S JUST CRAZY WE HAVE TO WORRY

167
00:09:11,251 --> 00:09:12,717
ABOUT OUR LOOKS SO MUCH.

168
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:14,252
IT STARTS SO YOUNG AS A GIRL.

169
00:09:14,254 --> 00:09:15,620
I SAW THIS GIRL THE OTHER DAY.

170
00:09:15,622 --> 00:09:17,022
SHE WAS PROBABLY 6 YEARS OLD.

171
00:09:17,024 --> 00:09:19,190
AND HER DAD WAS TRYING TO TAKE A

172
00:09:19,192 --> 00:09:20,458
PICTURE OF HER.

173
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:22,193
McKENZIE, LOOK OVER HERE.

174
00:09:22,195 --> 00:09:24,362
DAD, GET MY GOOD SIDE.

175
00:09:24,364 --> 00:09:27,265
SHE'S LIKE, "GOOD SIDE."

176
00:09:27,267 --> 00:09:27,499
6.

177
00:09:27,501 --> 00:09:28,233
SO SAD, BECAUSE SHE DIDN'T HAVE

178
00:09:28,235 --> 00:09:28,500
ONE.

179
00:09:29,803 --> 00:09:31,236
IT'S LIKE, WHEN IS SHE GOING TO

180
00:09:31,238 --> 00:09:31,836
FIND OUT?

181
00:09:31,838 --> 00:09:32,571
SHE NEEDS TO LEARN A TRADE, YOU

182
00:09:32,573 --> 00:09:34,906
KNOW?

183
00:09:34,908 --> 00:09:35,740
HAND HER A WRENCH OR DO COMEDY.

184
00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:38,977
I DON'T KNOW.

185
00:09:39,379 --> 00:09:40,245
I JUST THINK THERE'S SO MANY

186
00:09:40,247 --> 00:09:41,913
THINGS WE DO FOR BEAUTY THAT ARE

187
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:43,048
IMPORTANT, BUT THERE'S OTHER

188
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:44,749
ONES I'M LIKE, WHY ARE WE DOING

189
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:45,150
THIS?

190
00:09:45,152 --> 00:09:45,650
WHO CARES?

191
00:09:45,652 --> 00:09:46,751
LIKE NAILS.

192
00:09:46,753 --> 00:09:47,419
NO ONE CARES.

193
00:09:47,421 --> 00:09:48,720
LIKE, I'VE BEEN WITH MY

194
00:09:48,722 --> 00:09:49,821
BOYFRIEND FOR TEN YEARS.

195
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:50,855
HE'S NEVER ONCE NOTICED THAT

196
00:09:50,857 --> 00:09:52,490
I'VE GOTTEN MY NAILS DONE.

197
00:09:52,492 --> 00:09:54,993
AND THEY GO INSIDE HIM.

198
00:09:55,462 --> 00:09:58,997
SO IF HE DOESN'T CARE, WHO DOES?

199
00:09:58,999 --> 00:10:01,600
THE ONLY TIME HE CARED WAS WHEN

200
00:10:01,602 --> 00:10:03,635
I WAS THEM BEDAZZLED FOR HIS

201
00:10:03,637 --> 00:10:04,035
PLEASURE.

202
00:10:04,438 --> 00:10:05,737
THEN HE LOVED THEM.

203
00:10:05,739 --> 00:10:07,439
GOING TO THE NAIL SALON, IT'S SO

204
00:10:07,441 --> 00:10:09,107
BORING.

205
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:09,741
IT'S SUCH A WASTE OF TIME.

206
00:10:09,743 --> 00:10:10,775
YOU JUST SIT THERE FOR TWO HOURS

207
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:11,977
JUST PARALYZED.

208
00:10:11,979 --> 00:10:13,778
I FEEL LIKE MEN THINK WE GO TO

209
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,447
THE NAIL SALON WITH OUR

210
00:10:15,449 --> 00:10:16,247
GIRLFRIENDS AND CHITCHAT THE

211
00:10:16,249 --> 00:10:17,849
WHOLE TIME, BUT THAT'S NOT THE

212
00:10:17,851 --> 00:10:18,149
CASE.

213
00:10:18,151 --> 00:10:19,517
YOU CAN GO TO THE NAIL SALON

214
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:20,952
WITH A FRIEND, BUT YOU GET

215
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:22,420
SEPARATED AT THE BORDER.

216
00:10:22,422 --> 00:10:25,890
THEY DO NOT LET YOU SIT NEXT TO

217
00:10:25,892 --> 00:10:26,558
EACH OTHER.

218
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:29,227
IT'S SO ANTISOCIAL.

219
00:10:29,229 --> 00:10:30,695
YOU CAN'T TALK TO THE WOMAN

220
00:10:30,697 --> 00:10:32,597
DOING YOUR NAILS, BECAUSE

221
00:10:32,599 --> 00:10:32,931
SLAVERY?

222
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:34,165
I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW.

223
00:10:34,167 --> 00:10:35,133
SHE SEEMS STUCK AND SAD.

224
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:38,069
I DON'T KNOW.

225
00:10:38,071 --> 00:10:39,437
I THINK I'M JUST PARANOID.

226
00:10:39,439 --> 00:10:40,739
I'M JUST KIND OF OBSESSED WITH

227
00:10:40,741 --> 00:10:43,475
SLAVERY RECENTLY, BECAUSE --

228
00:10:43,477 --> 00:10:47,012
EVERY TIME YOU GO TO A WOMEN'S

229
00:10:47,014 --> 00:10:47,746
RESTROOM, A PUBLIC WOMEN'S

230
00:10:47,748 --> 00:10:48,747
RESTROOM, IN THE STALL THERE'S A

231
00:10:48,749 --> 00:10:50,348
POSTER ON THE BACK OF THE STALL

232
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:52,350
ASKING YOU IF YOU'RE BEING

233
00:10:52,352 --> 00:10:52,751
TRAFFICKED.

234
00:10:52,753 --> 00:10:53,918
WOMEN, WE HAVE THESE, RIGHT?

235
00:10:54,855 --> 00:10:55,286
YES, YES.

236
00:10:55,288 --> 00:10:57,656
IN EVERY STALL, IN EVERY WORLD

237
00:10:57,658 --> 00:10:58,123
LANGUAGE.

238
00:10:58,125 --> 00:10:59,824
ENGLISH IS REALLY TINY AND IT'S

239
00:10:59,826 --> 00:11:00,425
LIKE, "YOU WISH."

240
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:05,163
BUT IT'S LIKE -- MEN'SEST

241
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:06,831
RESTROOMS DO NOT HAVE THESE

242
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:07,165
SIGNS.

243
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:08,366
I DON'T KNOW WHAT SIGNS YOU

244
00:11:08,368 --> 00:11:08,667
HAVE.

245
00:11:08,669 --> 00:11:11,036
MAYBE YOU HAVE SIGNS LIKE, "WANT

246
00:11:11,038 --> 00:11:11,903
A SLAVE?

247
00:11:11,905 --> 00:11:12,537
TEXT "TRAFFIC" TO 6969."

248
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:16,675
BUT IT'S REALLY A BIG FEAR OF

249
00:11:16,677 --> 00:11:18,109
BEING TRAFFICKED.

250
00:11:18,111 --> 00:11:19,277
MOSTLY FOR GEN-Z GIRLS.

251
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:20,378
I HAVE A LOT OF GEN-Z FRIENDS

252
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:20,812
THAT I BOUGHT.

253
00:11:23,817 --> 00:11:25,183
THEY'RE TERRIFIED.

254
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:26,317
AND I DON'T RELATE.

255
00:11:26,319 --> 00:11:27,185
I'M 41.

256
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:28,920
THAT WAS LIKE NOT A FEAR OF MINE

257
00:11:28,922 --> 00:11:30,188
EVER IN MY 20s.

258
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:32,824
IN MY 20s I JUST FEARED GOOD

259
00:11:32,826 --> 00:11:33,858
OLD-FASHIONED RAPE.

260
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:35,060
I DIDN'T THINK IT WOULD BE A

261
00:11:35,062 --> 00:11:35,694
CAREER.

262
00:11:35,696 --> 00:11:38,263
WE DIDN'T THINK --

263
00:11:38,665 --> 00:11:40,699
IT WAS ANYTHING MORE THAN A TEMP

264
00:11:40,701 --> 00:11:42,500
JOB AT A FRAT HOUSE FUTON.

265
00:11:42,502 --> 00:11:43,168
BUT IT'S REAL.

266
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:44,369
I'M GETTING SCARED.

267
00:11:44,371 --> 00:11:46,271
IT'S RUBBING OUT WITH ME.

268
00:11:46,273 --> 00:11:48,406
WHAT IF WE GET TRAFFICKED?

269
00:11:48,408 --> 00:11:49,074
THEY'RE LIKE, "YOU'RE GOOD."

270
00:11:51,511 --> 00:11:53,278
THEY'RE LIKE, "WE'RE SAFER WHEN

271
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,246
YOU'RE WITH US BECAUSE THEY

272
00:11:55,248 --> 00:11:58,249
THINK YOU'RE OUR MADAM."

273
00:11:59,152 --> 00:12:00,985
"YOU HAVE RESTING GHISLAINE"

274
00:12:00,987 --> 00:12:02,554
FACE, SO KEEP THAT UP."

275
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:03,354
WHAT?

276
00:12:03,356 --> 00:12:04,656
I'M GOING TO GET IT FIXED.

277
00:12:04,658 --> 00:12:05,890
I'M GOING TO GET A FACELIFT

278
00:12:05,892 --> 00:12:06,725
PRETTY SOON HERE.

279
00:12:06,727 --> 00:12:08,793
MY BOYFRIEND DOESN'T WANT ME TO.

280
00:12:08,795 --> 00:12:12,464
HE'S LIKE, NO, DON'T DO YOUR

281
00:12:12,466 --> 00:12:13,832
FACE, I LOVE YOUR FACE, DO YOUR

282
00:12:13,834 --> 00:12:14,265
TITS.

283
00:12:14,668 --> 00:12:14,966
WHAT?

284
00:12:14,968 --> 00:12:16,434
THAT'S ALL HE CARES ABOUT.

285
00:12:16,436 --> 00:12:18,103
HE'S A SHORT GUY, THEY'RE ALL HE

286
00:12:18,105 --> 00:12:19,304
SEES, I THINK.

287
00:12:19,306 --> 00:12:20,572
I THINK THAT'S WHY HE'S FOCUSED

288
00:12:20,574 --> 00:12:21,539
ON THEM.

289
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:23,308
I DO DATE A SHORT GUY, SHORTER

290
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:24,809
THAN ME, BUT REALLY HOT.

291
00:12:24,811 --> 00:12:26,277
I THINK THAT'S WHY I GOT HIM,

292
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:27,145
BECAUSE I COULD NEVER GET HIS

293
00:12:27,147 --> 00:12:29,047
FACE ON A TALLER MODEL.

294
00:12:29,649 --> 00:12:30,515
LIKE, IF YOU WANT TO GET A 10 IN

295
00:12:30,517 --> 00:12:34,853
THE FACE, YOU'VE GOT TO GO 5'7"

296
00:12:34,855 --> 00:12:35,920
IN THE HEIGHT.

297
00:12:35,922 --> 00:12:37,622
GETTING A HOT GUY ON DISCOUNT.

298
00:12:37,624 --> 00:12:38,656
HE'S MARKED DOWN.

299
00:12:38,658 --> 00:12:40,925
I MET MY BOYFRIEND AT TJ MAXX,

300
00:12:40,927 --> 00:12:42,994
CLEARANCE RACK, HE WAS HIDING IN

301
00:12:42,996 --> 00:12:43,628
IT.

302
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:44,496
IT'S CRAZY.

303
00:12:44,498 --> 00:12:45,797
SOMETIMES I'LL POST A PICTURE OF

304
00:12:45,799 --> 00:12:47,766
US ONLINE AND I'LL GET COMMENTS

305
00:12:47,768 --> 00:12:49,601
OF, GIRL, HE'S HOT, HOW DID YOU

306
00:12:49,603 --> 00:12:50,135
GET HIM?

307
00:12:50,137 --> 00:12:53,471
I'M LIKE, IF YOU ZOOMED OUT,

308
00:12:53,473 --> 00:12:54,405
YOU'D SEE HE'S SITTING ON MY

309
00:12:54,407 --> 00:12:54,706
LAP.

310
00:12:55,108 --> 00:12:56,207
THIS IS A TINY GUY.

311
00:12:56,209 --> 00:12:59,310
WENT DIGGING IN THE BARGAIN BIN,

312
00:12:59,312 --> 00:12:59,811
LADIES.

313
00:12:59,813 --> 00:13:01,246
BUT -- YEAH, GIRLS DON'T LIKE

314
00:13:01,248 --> 00:13:03,014
SHORT GUYS.

315
00:13:03,016 --> 00:13:04,549
AND I GUESS IT'S BECAUSE YOU

316
00:13:04,551 --> 00:13:06,885
WANT A TALL GUY SO THAT YOU CAN

317
00:13:06,887 --> 00:13:08,620
FEEL LIKE, HE CAN PROTECT ME,

318
00:13:08,622 --> 00:13:09,854
AND MURDER ME SOMEDAY.

319
00:13:09,856 --> 00:13:11,856
I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S IT.

320
00:13:11,858 --> 00:13:13,992
BUT MY BOYFRIEND'S SHORTER THAN

321
00:13:13,994 --> 00:13:14,259
ME.

322
00:13:14,261 --> 00:13:15,393
I'VE NEVER FELT LIKE HE CAN'T

323
00:13:15,395 --> 00:13:16,761
PROTECT ME, AND I AM CERTAIN HE

324
00:13:16,763 --> 00:13:17,695
WILL MURDER ME SOMEDAY.

325
00:13:18,098 --> 00:13:19,464
HE IS SO FILLED WITH RAGE THAT

326
00:13:19,466 --> 00:13:20,031
HE'S SHORT.

327
00:13:20,033 --> 00:13:21,966
I MEAN, HE IS JUST SIMMERING

328
00:13:21,968 --> 00:13:22,867
WITH ANGER.

329
00:13:22,869 --> 00:13:24,202
AND THAT'S WHY I KEEP OUR GUN ON

330
00:13:24,204 --> 00:13:25,937
THE TOP SHELF.

331
00:13:26,339 --> 00:13:27,005
I CAN'T RISK THAT.

332
00:13:27,007 --> 00:13:29,240
I NEED HIM TO GO GET A

333
00:13:29,242 --> 00:13:31,242
STEPLADDER AND THINK IT THROUGH,

334
00:13:31,244 --> 00:13:32,043
YOU KNOW?

335
00:13:32,045 --> 00:13:33,545
THE NUMBER OF TIMES I'VE WALKED

336
00:13:33,547 --> 00:13:34,245
INTO OUR CLOSET AND SEEN HIM

337
00:13:34,247 --> 00:13:36,481
LIKE --

338
00:13:36,883 --> 00:13:39,984
AND I'M LIKE, "DOES SOMEONE NEED

339
00:13:39,986 --> 00:13:42,453
TO GET UPPY-UPPY TO GET THE

340
00:13:42,455 --> 00:13:44,889
BANG-BANG TO MAKE NIKKI GO

341
00:13:44,891 --> 00:13:45,256
BYE-BYE?"

342
00:13:45,258 --> 00:13:46,624
THEN I GIVE HIM A JUICE BOX, AND

343
00:13:46,626 --> 00:13:48,526
HE FORGETS WHY HE'S UPSET.

344
00:13:48,528 --> 00:13:49,494
WE DON'T HAVE KIDS BECAUSE I

345
00:13:49,496 --> 00:13:51,062
DON'T WANT TO PASS DOWN THAT

346
00:13:51,064 --> 00:13:51,462
DNA.

347
00:13:51,865 --> 00:13:53,064
BUT IT'S JUST -- I FEEL LIKE

348
00:13:53,066 --> 00:13:54,699
IT'S TOO HARD TO BE A MOM.

349
00:13:54,701 --> 00:13:56,668
I HAVE TOO MUCH ANXIETY ABOUT

350
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:56,935
IT.

351
00:13:56,937 --> 00:13:57,902
IT'S HARD BEING AN AUNT.

352
00:13:57,904 --> 00:13:59,637
I WAS STAYING AT MY SISTER'S

353
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:00,705
HOUSE RECENTLY, AND AT ONE POINT

354
00:14:00,707 --> 00:14:02,574
I WAS LIKE, "I'M GOING TO GO

355
00:14:02,576 --> 00:14:03,708
TAKE A SHOWER."

356
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:05,743
MY NEPHEW COMES RUNNING IN, "I

357
00:14:05,745 --> 00:14:07,345
TAKE A SHOWER WITH YOU!"

358
00:14:07,347 --> 00:14:08,179
HE'S 18.

359
00:14:08,582 --> 00:14:09,314
I'M LIKE, WHAT'S GOING ON WITH

360
00:14:09,316 --> 00:14:12,650
HIS VOICE?

361
00:14:12,652 --> 00:14:13,518
SOMETHING'S WRONG.

362
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:14,152
NO, NO.

363
00:14:14,154 --> 00:14:16,221
HE WAS 4, AND IT WAS VERY CUTE.

364
00:14:16,223 --> 00:14:17,822
MY SISTER'S LIKE, HE CAN TAKE A

365
00:14:17,824 --> 00:14:19,657
SHOWER WITH YOU, IT'S FINE, HE

366
00:14:19,659 --> 00:14:21,159
DOES IT WITH US.

367
00:14:21,161 --> 00:14:23,261
OKAY, THAT'S FINE FOR YOU GUYS

368
00:14:23,263 --> 00:14:25,196
BUT ARE YOU OKAY WITHN AN ADULT

369
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:26,264
SHOWERING WITH YOUR CHILD?

370
00:14:26,266 --> 00:14:27,832
MAYBE IT'S OKAY IF YOU COME AND

371
00:14:27,834 --> 00:14:28,199
SUPERVISE.

372
00:14:28,201 --> 00:14:29,434
SHE WAS LIKE, WHY?

373
00:14:29,436 --> 00:14:30,735
AND I WAS LIKE, WHAT AM.

374
00:14:30,737 --> 00:14:31,202
>> I MOLEST HIM?

375
00:14:36,509 --> 00:14:37,675
SHE WAS LIKE, WOULD YOU?

376
00:14:37,677 --> 00:14:38,810
I WAS LIKE, NO!

377
00:14:38,812 --> 00:14:39,244
I WOULD NEVER!

378
00:14:39,246 --> 00:14:41,379
THAT'S DISGUSTING!

379
00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:43,982
BUT THAT'S WHAT I'D SAY IF I WAS

380
00:14:43,984 --> 00:14:44,616
GONNA.

381
00:14:45,118 --> 00:14:46,317
THEY LIE!

382
00:14:46,319 --> 00:14:49,020
DON'T TRUST ANYONE.

383
00:14:49,022 --> 00:14:49,654
I DON'T EVEN TRUST MYSELF.

384
00:14:49,656 --> 00:14:50,355
I DON'T WANT TO GO IN THERE.

385
00:14:50,357 --> 00:14:51,689
HOW DO YOU BECOME A PEDESTRIAN

386
00:14:51,691 --> 00:14:52,023
TILE?

387
00:14:52,025 --> 00:14:53,124
YOU DON'T GET TO CHOOSE WHAT

388
00:14:53,126 --> 00:14:54,325
YOU'RE INTO, DUDE.

389
00:14:54,327 --> 00:14:55,560
WHAT IF IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS

390
00:14:55,562 --> 00:14:57,528
YOU DON'T KNOW YOU LIKE TILL YOU

391
00:14:57,530 --> 00:14:59,530
GET IN THERE AND YOU'RE LIKE,

392
00:14:59,532 --> 00:15:00,365
WELL, THIS IS MY THING.

393
00:15:00,367 --> 00:15:02,200
AND IT OPENS UP A PART OF MY

394
00:15:02,202 --> 00:15:02,500
BRAIN.

395
00:15:02,502 --> 00:15:03,601
NO, NO, NO.

396
00:15:03,603 --> 00:15:05,336
I KNOW THAT SOUNDS CRAZY, BUT

397
00:15:05,338 --> 00:15:06,404
THERE HAVE BEEN SO MANY THINGS

398
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:08,806
IN MY LIFE THAT I'VE BEEN, I

399
00:15:08,808 --> 00:15:10,008
WOULD NEVER DO THAT.

400
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:13,044
AND NOW I'M LIKE, LOOKS KIND OF

401
00:15:13,046 --> 00:15:13,711
FUN, ACTUALLY.

402
00:15:14,114 --> 00:15:14,612
SO I DON'T KNOW.

403
00:15:14,614 --> 00:15:16,281
THANK YOU GUYS SO MUCH.

404
00:15:16,883 --> 00:15:17,849

405

00:19:05,762 --> 00:19:06,227
SEPARATE BEDS.

513
00:19:06,229 --> 00:19:06,661

IF SO, YOU MAY BE ONE OF THE

570
00:20:57,373 --> 00:20:58,639
MANY CELEBRITIES WHO ARE

571
00:20:58,641 --> 00:21:02,677
SCHEDULED TO DANCE THROUGH THE

572
00:21:02,679 --> 00:21:03,377
JENNIFER HUDSON SPIRIT TUNNEL.

573
00:21:09,052 --> 00:21:11,052
>> I LOVE JENNIFER HUDSON.

574
00:21:11,054 --> 00:21:12,253
BUT AS AN UNCOORDINATED WHITE

575
00:21:12,255 --> 00:21:14,622
WOMAN, I FELT TRAPPED.

576
00:21:14,624 --> 00:21:15,256
I'D TRIED PRACTICING, BUT

577
00:21:15,258 --> 00:21:15,990
EVERYTHING I CAME UP WITH LOOKED

578
00:21:15,992 --> 00:21:17,058
CAREER-ENDING.

579
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:17,758
POINTING.

580
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,260
SHOULDER SHRUG.

581
00:21:19,262 --> 00:21:20,728
DRUNK AUNT AT A WEDDING.

582
00:21:20,730 --> 00:21:21,495
I EVEN TRIED TO PUT MY ASS INTO

583
00:21:21,497 --> 00:21:22,763
IT.

584
00:21:22,765 --> 00:21:26,267
BUT I DON'T HAVE ONE.

585
00:21:26,269 --> 00:21:28,002
I JUST KEPT IMAGINING MYSELF IN

586
00:21:28,004 --> 00:21:29,503
THAT TUNNEL.

587
00:21:29,505 --> 00:21:33,374
¶ COME ON NIKKI YOU'RE SO FINE

588
00:21:33,376 --> 00:21:35,109

589
00:21:35,111 --> 00:21:37,144
HEY NIKKI HEY NIKKI ¶

590
00:21:37,146 --> 00:21:37,878
>> IT FELT LIKE THERE WAS NO WAY

591
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:38,646
OUT.

592
00:21:38,648 --> 00:21:39,613
THAT'S WHEN MY DOCTOR TOLD ME

593
00:21:39,615 --> 00:21:44,885
ABOUT HUDSICILLIN.

594
00:21:44,887 --> 00:21:47,488
HUDSICILLIN IS THE

595
00:21:47,490 --> 00:21:49,924
ONLY MEDICATION PROVED TO KILL

596
00:21:49,926 --> 00:21:50,891
TUNNEL ANXIETY.

597
00:21:50,893 --> 00:21:52,626
NOT BY MAKING YOUR BODY AWAY BIT

598
00:21:52,628 --> 00:21:55,596
BY MAKING YOU SO VIOLENTLY ILL.

599
00:21:55,598 --> 00:21:56,230
YOU HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO

600
00:21:56,232 --> 00:21:56,564
CANCEL.

601
00:21:56,566 --> 00:21:57,264
IT WORKS FAST, MAYBE TOO FAST.

602
00:21:57,266 --> 00:21:57,999
30 SECONDS AFTER MY FIRST DOSE,

603
00:21:58,001 --> 00:21:58,699
I WAS SHAKING ON THE BATHROOM

604
00:21:58,701 --> 00:22:01,168
FLOOR.

605
00:22:01,170 --> 00:22:02,003
NOT KNOWING WHICH END OF ME TO

606
00:22:02,005 --> 00:22:03,237
AIM AT THE TOILET.

607
00:22:03,239 --> 00:22:04,739
THAT'S BECAUSE HUDSICILLIN IS

608
00:22:04,741 --> 00:22:06,741
MADE FROM A GENTLE BLEND OF E.

609
00:22:06,743 --> 00:22:09,243
COLI, INFLUENZA, C. DIFF.

610
00:22:09,245 --> 00:22:10,845
AND RANCID BUTTERMILK.

611
00:22:10,847 --> 00:22:13,447
I FINALLY HAVE MY LIFE BACK.

612
00:22:13,449 --> 00:22:14,648
AND NOW MY SPOT IN THE TUNNEL

613
00:22:14,650 --> 00:22:15,349
CAN GO TO SOMEONE WHO REALLY

614
00:22:15,351 --> 00:22:18,519
WANTS IT.

LIGHTENING UP AND BEING FUN?

619

THE PRINCE WHO OWNS THIS CASTLE

631
00:23:16,362 --> 00:23:18,229
WAS CURSED TO BECOME A TERRIBLE

00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:25,870
HE'S NOT JUST ANY BEAST.

NAME.

1250

WE THOUGHT "THE STATEN ISLAND

1251
00:46:01,810 --> 00:46:03,376

1252

EVER GIVE UP.

1261
00:46:17,692 --> 00:46:18,758
EVEN IF EVERYONE SAYS THE TIME

HAS COME AND TINA FEY IS READY

1263

TO MAKE THIS FERRY MORE OF A

1266
00:46:31,973 --> 00:46:32,338
SUCCESS.

1267
00:46:32,340 --> 00:46:32,805

>> AS YOU KNOW, WE JUST HAD A

1269

MAYORAL ELECTION, WHICH IS MY

1270
00:46:37,145 --> 00:46:37,810
LEAST FAVORITE KIND OF ORAL.

1271
00:46:41,616 --> 00:46:45,651
THAT'S A CLASSIC PETE!

1272

YOU'VE BEEN GONE FOR YEARS.

1275

DID YOU PROMISE TO MOVE OUT OF

1284

TOO MANY WARRANTS IN NEW JERSEY

1286
00:47:16,284 --> 00:47:18,417
AND NOT ENOUGH GUNS FOR FLORIDA?

1287
00:47:18,820 --> 00:47:19,518
WELCOME TO NEW STATEN ISLAND!

1288
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:22,088
YEAH!

1289
00:47:22,090 --> 00:47:23,089
IT WILL HAVE EVERYTHING THAT

1290
00:47:23,091 --> 00:47:23,756
MAKES STATEN ISLAND GREAT.

1291
00:47:23,758 --> 00:47:24,590

NEW STATEN ISLAND.

1295
00:47:33,001 --> 00:47:34,867
WE CAN'T CALL IT THE TITANIC

1296
00:47:34,869 --> 00:47:36,269
ANYMORE SINCE THE PEOPLE ON THIS

1297
00:47:36,271 --> 00:47:37,036
SHIP WILL ACTUALLY LOVE RUNNING

1298

INTO ICE.

1299
00:47:42,010 --> 00:47:42,575
THAT WAS PRETTY GOOD.

1300
00:47:42,577 --> 00:47:43,643
GOT IT GOING, YEP.

1301
00:47:43,645 --> 00:47:44,610
STILL GOT IT.

1302
00:47:44,612 --> 00:47:46,045
>> I JUST FEEL LIKE IT'S GOING

1303
00:47:46,047 --> 00:47:47,246
TO BE A BIG YEAR FOR US.

1304
00:47:47,248 --> 00:47:48,381
>> I THINK SO TOO, I COULDN'T BE

1305
00:47:48,383 --> 00:47:49,048
MORE EXCITED.

1306
00:47:49,050 --> 00:47:50,950
MY POINT IS, LOOK, THE FERRY,

1307
00:47:50,952 --> 00:47:52,785
IT'S FINE.

1308
00:47:52,787 --> 00:47:53,653
SOMETIMES THE NEWS JUST MAKES

1309
00:47:53,655 --> 00:47:55,187
THINGS SEEM WORSE THAN THEY ARE.

1310
00:47:55,189 --> 00:47:56,322
LIKE HOW EVERYONE WAS SURE

1311
00:47:56,324 --> 00:47:57,623
CERTAIN PEOPLE WOULD BE EXPOSED

1312
00:47:57,625 --> 00:48:00,126
AND RUINED FOR PEOPLE ON THE

1313

EPSTEIN LIST.

1314

THIS IS PRETTY SERIOUS, OKAY?

1328

00:49:01,756 --> 00:49:04,390
ACTUALLY A FRAT GUY IN A

1333
00:49:04,392 --> 00:49:05,958
HYPER-REALISTIC GIRL MASK.

1334
00:49:05,960 --> 00:49:06,525
>> NO WAY.

1335
00:49:06,527 --> 00:49:07,159
>> WHAT?

1336
00:49:07,161 --> 00:49:07,827
>> WHAT?

1337
00:49:07,829 --> 00:49:08,561
>> OH, MY GOD, THAT'S SO WEIRD.

1338
00:49:10,131 --> 00:49:12,698
>> YEAH, THAT IS SO WEIRD!

1339
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:14,300
>> I KNOW.

1340
00:49:14,302 --> 00:49:16,569
WELL, THEY ASKED US TO JUST STAY

1341
00:49:16,571 --> 00:49:17,203
VIGILANT, OKAY?

1342
00:49:17,205 --> 00:49:18,637
I'M JUST ASKING YOU, IF YOU SEE

1343
00:49:18,639 --> 00:49:19,338
ANYTHING, JUST SAY SOMETHING,

00:49:19,340 --> 00:49:21,707
OKAY?

1345
00:49:21,709 --> 00:49:23,876
>> UM, SO I DON'T WANT TO, LIKE,

1346
00:49:23,878 --> 00:49:25,277
CALL SOMEONE OUT OR WHATEVER.

1347
00:49:25,279 --> 00:49:27,513
BUT I THINK SOMEONE IN OUR

1348
00:49:27,515 --> 00:49:30,483
SORORITY HEAT BE A FRAT GUY IN A

1349
00:49:30,485 --> 00:49:31,150
HERE REALISTIC MASK.

1350
00:49:31,152 --> 00:49:31,884
>> WHAT?

1351
00:49:31,886 --> 00:49:32,718
>> WHAT, NO WAY.

1352
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:34,120
>> WHAT THE HELL?

1353
00:49:34,522 --> 00:49:36,555
>> I THINK IT'S ALYSSA.

1354
00:49:36,557 --> 00:49:36,889
>> WAIT.

1356
00:49:39,293 --> 00:49:41,093
>> ARE YOU CRAZY?

1357
00:49:41,095 --> 00:49:42,762
>> SO MEAN.

1358
00:49:42,764 --> 00:49:44,029
>> SHAME ON YOU, MADDIE.

1359
00:49:44,031 --> 00:49:45,064
>> THAT'S MESSED UP.

1360
00:49:45,066 --> 00:49:45,431
>> YEAH.

1361
00:49:45,433 --> 00:49:46,499
>> WHAT THE HELL, MADDIE?

1362
00:49:46,501 --> 00:49:47,166
HAVE SOME RESPECT FOR YOUR

1363
00:49:47,168 --> 00:49:49,969
SISTER.

1364
00:49:49,971 --> 00:49:51,370
>> SORRY.

1365
00:49:51,372 --> 00:49:52,905
YOU SAID SAY SOMETHING IF YOU

1366
00:49:52,907 --> 00:49:53,606
SAW SOMETHING STRANGE.

1367
00:49:53,608 --> 00:49:55,040
>> JUST SAY IT, MADDIE.

1368
00:49:55,042 --> 00:50:00,713
YOU THINK ALYSSA'S UGLY.

1369
00:50:00,715 --> 00:50:02,782
HOW TO THE ABSOLUTE DARE YOU!

1370
00:50:02,784 --> 00:50:03,983
DELTA GAMMAS DON'T JUDGE

1371
00:50:03,985 --> 00:50:05,217
PEOPLE'S LOOKS.

1372
00:50:05,219 --> 00:50:07,787
DID YOU FORGET OUR MOTTO?

1373
00:50:07,789 --> 00:50:09,555
DON'T JUDGE PEOPLE'S LOOKS.

1374
00:50:09,957 --> 00:50:11,357
WE JUDGE PEOPLE BY HOW MUCH

1375
00:50:11,359 --> 00:50:12,358
MONEY THEIR PARENTS MAKE.

1376
00:50:12,360 --> 00:50:13,893
>> OKAY, YEAH.

1377
00:50:13,895 --> 00:50:15,795
THIS ISN'T ABOUT ALYSSA, MADDIE,

1378
00:50:15,797 --> 00:50:16,862
IT'S ABOUT YOU.

1379
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:22,067
YOU ALWAYS GET ON NEW SISTERS.

1380
00:50:22,069 --> 00:50:24,136
YOU WERE AWFUL TO ME LAST YEAR,

1381
00:50:24,138 --> 00:50:25,738
NOW YOU'RE ACCUSING HER OF BEING

1382
00:50:25,740 --> 00:50:27,239
A FRAT GUY IN A MASK?

1383
00:50:27,241 --> 00:50:28,007
THAT'S DISGUSTING.

1384
00:50:28,009 --> 00:50:28,974
>> DISGUSTING!

1385
00:50:28,976 --> 00:50:30,009
>> OKAY, DO YOU SEE HOW SHE

1386
00:50:30,011 --> 00:50:30,309
EATS?

1387
00:50:30,311 --> 00:50:31,277
THAT IS NOT NORMAL.

1388
00:50:31,279 --> 00:50:33,846
>> WHAT?

1389
00:50:33,848 --> 00:50:35,181
>> YOU'RE JUST JEALOUS OF WHAT

1390
00:50:35,183 --> 00:50:38,284
AN AMAZING PERSON ALYSSA IS.

1391
00:50:38,286 --> 00:50:39,952
HER CONTRIBUTION TO DELTA GAMMA

1392
00:50:39,954 --> 00:50:41,253
IS UNMATCHED.

1393
00:50:41,255 --> 00:50:42,488
SHE'S JUST A FIRST YEAR AND

1394
00:50:42,490 --> 00:50:43,989
SHE'S ALREADY PLANNED NOT ONE,

1395
00:50:43,991 --> 00:50:47,326
NOT TWO, BUT 15 BIKINI CAR WASH

1396
00:50:47,328 --> 00:50:47,760
FUND-RAISERS.

1397
00:50:48,162 --> 00:50:50,963
>> YEAH, GIRL POWER!

1398
00:50:50,965 --> 00:50:51,997
>> DON'T YOU THINK IT'S

1399
00:50:51,999 --> 00:50:53,466
SUSPICIOUS THAT SHE NEVER

1400
00:50:53,468 --> 00:50:53,899
PARTICIPATES?

1401
00:50:53,901 --> 00:50:56,235
>> SHE'S ALLERGIC TO THE SUN.

1402
00:50:56,237 --> 00:50:58,070
IT'S JUST SAFER FOR HER TO WATCH

1403
00:50:58,072 --> 00:51:00,105
FROM THE GARAGE, WEARING

1404
00:51:00,107 --> 00:51:00,773
SUNGLASSES, WITH A PILE OF

1405
00:51:00,775 --> 00:51:05,611
TOWELS ON HER LAP.

1406
00:51:05,613 --> 00:51:06,278
I'M SORRY, MADDIE, BUT YOUR

1407
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:07,580
THEORY IS REJECTED DUE TO LACK

1408
00:51:07,582 --> 00:51:08,047
OF PROOF.

1409
00:51:08,049 --> 00:51:08,747
>> CAN MY PROOF BE HER VAPING

1410
00:51:08,749 --> 00:51:11,283
RIGHT NOW?

1411
00:51:11,285 --> 00:51:12,151
THE SMOKE IS COMING OUT OF HER

1412
00:51:12,153 --> 00:51:14,587
EYEHOLES.

1413
00:51:14,589 --> 00:51:17,289
HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN THIS?

1414
00:51:17,291 --> 00:51:20,459
>> IT JUST DOES THAT!

1415
00:51:20,461 --> 00:51:21,827
>> MADDIE, STOP.

1416
00:51:21,829 --> 00:51:23,262
YOU'RE MAKING ALYSSA SAD.

1417
00:51:23,264 --> 00:51:27,166
LOOK.

1418
00:51:32,039 --> 00:51:40,546
>> SO SAD.

1419
00:51:40,548 --> 00:51:42,348
>> MAYBE I SHOULD JUST GO.

1420
00:51:42,350 --> 00:51:42,648
>> NO!

1421
00:51:42,650 --> 00:51:45,050
>> DON'T GO!

1422
00:51:45,052 --> 00:51:47,019
>> CAN WE JUST TAKE A MOMENT AND

1423
00:51:47,021 --> 00:51:50,222
LOOK AT WHAT'S INSIDE HER PURSE?

1424
00:51:50,224 --> 00:51:52,858
A HUGE UNOPENED BOX OF MAXI

1425
00:51:52,860 --> 00:51:53,158
PADS.

1426
00:51:53,160 --> 00:51:53,993
>> WHAT?

1427
00:51:53,995 --> 00:51:55,060
>> A BEANIE BABY.

1428
00:51:55,062 --> 00:51:55,794
>> WHAT?

1429
00:51:55,796 --> 00:51:56,529
>> AND A FRAMED PHOTO OF HILLARY

1430
00:51:56,531 --> 00:51:56,862
CLINTON.

1431
00:51:59,967 --> 00:52:00,833
>> AND?

1432
00:52:00,835 --> 00:52:03,068
>> AND THAT LOOKS LIKE A STUPID

1433
00:52:03,070 --> 00:52:04,670
GUY WOULD THINK GIRLS HAVE IN

1434
00:52:04,672 --> 00:52:05,104
THEIR PURSE.

1435
00:52:05,106 --> 00:52:07,573
>> I'MA SLAP THIS BITCH.

1436
00:52:07,575 --> 00:52:08,674
>> CALM DOWN, JESUS.

1437
00:52:08,676 --> 00:52:09,542
THIS DISCUSSION IS OVER.

1438
00:52:09,544 --> 00:52:09,909
ALL RIGHT?

1439
00:52:09,911 --> 00:52:13,312
MEETING ADJOURNED.

1440
00:52:13,314 --> 00:52:14,280
>> GIVE ME MY PURSE.

1441
00:52:14,282 --> 00:52:15,014
>> OKAY.

1442
00:52:15,016 --> 00:52:17,149
>> I'M SO SORRY FOR ALL OF THIS,

1443
00:52:17,151 --> 00:52:17,483
ALYSSA.

1444
00:52:17,485 --> 00:52:20,853
>> IT'S OKAY.

1445
00:52:20,855 --> 00:52:24,189
BYE!

1446
00:52:24,191 --> 00:52:24,590
OH, MY GOD.

1447
00:52:24,592 --> 00:52:25,291
I'M GOING TO PASS OUT IN THIS

1448
00:52:25,293 --> 00:52:26,325
THING.

1449
00:52:26,327 --> 00:52:29,094
>> ALYSSA?

1450
00:52:29,096 --> 00:52:31,196
>> UH -- I CAN EXPLAIN.

1451
00:52:31,198 --> 00:52:35,467
>> NO NEED.

1452
00:52:35,469 --> 00:52:37,970
SECRET'S SAFE WITH ME, MAN.

1453
00:52:45,779 --> 00:52:59,391
BRAD.

1454

DON'T SIT IN YOUR ROOM, PLAY

>> I'M SERIOUS, BUD, COME ON.

1460
00:53:06,500 --> 00:53:07,499
SAY GOOD-BYE TO YOUR FRIENDS.

1461

00:53:08,269 --> 00:53:09,001
ONE SECOND.

1463

>> ONE.

1464
00:53:13,007 --> 00:53:13,772
>> ANYONE HAVE A SHIELD JACK?

1465
00:53:13,774 --> 00:53:14,773

BRAD'S GOT TO GO.

1468
00:53:17,278 --> 00:53:18,544
HEY!

FIRST OF ALL, YOU NEVER CALL

1470

SOMEONE THAT WORD.

1471
00:53:20,781 --> 00:53:22,247
SECOND OF ALL, IT MAKES NO SENSE

1472
00:53:22,249 --> 00:53:24,249
'CAUSE I'M WHITE.

1500
00:54:20,508 --> 00:54:27,246

1501
00:54:27,248 --> 00:54:28,013
OKAY.

YOU'RE ALL RIGHT.

1508
00:54:37,992 --> 00:54:44,496
YOU'RE ALL RIGHT.

1509
00:54:44,498 --> 00:54:46,031

1510
00:54:46,033 --> 00:54:48,000
BRAD, WHAT THE HECK IS THIS?

1511
00:54:48,002 --> 00:54:49,501

1512
00:54:49,503 --> 00:54:50,536

>> I KNOW.

1519
00:55:00,247 --> 00:55:05,017
>> GODDAMMIT.

1520
00:55:05,019 --> 00:55:05,784
>>> THERE'S A GUY ON YOUR LEFT.

1521
00:55:05,786 --> 00:55:07,019
ON MY HILL.

1522
00:55:07,021 --> 00:55:08,253
NICE.

1523
00:55:11,258 --> 00:55:17,730
OH, THAT'S YOUR MOM.

1524
00:55:17,732 --> 00:55:18,530
I LOVE YOU.

1525
00:55:18,532 --> 00:55:19,131
>> I LOVE YOU TOO, DAD.

1526
00:55:19,133 --> 00:55:19,865

1527
00:55:19,867 --> 00:55:20,766
DOES.

1528
00:55:20,768 --> 00:55:21,500
DON'T TELL HER I SAID THAT, BUT

1529
00:55:21,502 --> 00:55:22,000
IT'S TRUE.

1530
00:55:22,002 --> 00:55:22,768
OKAY?

1531
00:55:22,770 --> 00:55:26,004
>> OKAY.

1532
00:55:26,006 --> 00:55:27,272
BYE, DAD.

1533
00:55:27,274 --> 00:55:31,276

1534
00:55:31,278 --> 00:55:32,010
OH, SON OF A BITCH!

1535
00:55:32,012 --> 00:55:34,279
¶ BRAD ¶

1536
00:56:00,356 --> 00:56:04,059
>> I KNOW, WE WERE SUPPOSED TO

1537
00:56:04,061 --> 00:56:06,161
TAKE OFF A HALF-HOUR AGO.

1538
00:56:06,163 --> 00:56:07,496
>> LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WE DO

1539
00:56:07,498 --> 00:56:11,066
APOLOGIZE FOR THE DELAY.

1540
00:56:11,068 --> 00:56:12,334
AS YOU KNOW, THE GOVERNMENT

1541
00:56:12,336 --> 00:56:13,502
SHUTDOWN HAS AFFECTED THE

1542
00:56:13,504 --> 00:56:15,370
FLIGHTS AROUND THE COUNTRY.

1543
00:56:15,372 --> 00:56:19,241
I'M NOT BLAMING ANYONE, MAMDANI,

1544
00:56:19,243 --> 00:56:20,809
BUT WE'RE DOING OUR BEST TO MOVE

1545
00:56:20,811 --> 00:56:23,612
YOU GUYS AROUND ONCE AGAIN.

1546
00:56:23,614 --> 00:56:24,980
WE DO APOLOGIZE, AND THANK YOU.

1547
00:56:24,982 --> 00:56:27,182
>> GOD, THIS ABSOLUTELY STINKS.

1548
00:56:27,184 --> 00:56:28,083
>> HEY, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

1549
00:56:28,085 --> 00:56:29,184
FROM THE FLIGHT DECK, THIS IS

1550
00:56:29,186 --> 00:56:30,285
YOUR CAPTAIN SPEAKING.

1551
00:56:30,287 --> 00:56:31,286
JUST GOT WORD FROM THE TOWER.

1552
00:56:31,288 --> 00:56:32,955
IT'S GOING TO BE A BIT LONGER

1553
00:56:32,957 --> 00:56:34,089
HERE ON THE TARMAC.

1554
00:56:34,091 --> 00:56:35,257
PROBABLY IN ABOUT 15 MINUTES,

1555
00:56:35,259 --> 00:56:36,658
I'LL COME BACK ON AND TELL YOU

1556
00:56:36,660 --> 00:56:38,293
IT'S GOING TO BE TWO MORE HOURS.

1557
00:56:38,696 --> 00:56:40,395
GOOD NEWS IS, FINE WEATHER

1558
00:56:40,397 --> 00:56:41,230
COMING OUT OF CLEVELAND.

1559
00:56:41,232 --> 00:56:42,731
SHOULD BE A SMOOTH FLIGHT ONCE

1560
00:56:42,733 --> 00:56:44,199
WE GET UP IN THE AIR.

1561
00:56:44,201 --> 00:56:46,468
>> WE'RE GOING TO BE HERE

1562
00:56:46,470 --> 00:56:46,802
FOREVER.

1563
00:56:46,804 --> 00:56:48,137
>> TRUTH BE TOLD, CAN'T WAIT TO

1564
00:56:48,139 --> 00:56:49,238
GET TO CLEVELAND MYSELF.

1565
00:56:49,240 --> 00:56:50,372
GOING TO BE MEETING UP WITH A

1566
00:56:50,374 --> 00:56:52,207
YOUNG LADY OUT THERE.

1567
00:56:52,209 --> 00:56:53,909
I MET HER ON THE APPS.

1568
00:56:53,911 --> 00:56:55,310
ALWAYS SAID I WOULDN'T DO THE

1569
00:56:55,312 --> 00:56:57,045
APPS BUT LAST NIGHT I GOT A

1573
00:57:01,852 --> 00:57:02,818
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

1574
00:57:02,820 --> 00:57:04,286
IF YOU FOLLOW MY LEAD, YOU'RE

1575
00:57:04,288 --> 00:57:05,687
GOING TO BE SWIMMING IN IT.

1576
00:57:05,689 --> 00:57:08,457
>> THAT'S WONDERFUL, RITCHIE.

1577
00:57:08,459 --> 00:57:09,491
ALREADY MATCHED WITH A CUTE,

1578
00:57:09,493 --> 00:57:11,527
YEAH, A CUTE ABOUT 7.5 GIRL,

00:57:11,529 --> 00:57:14,096
SORT OF MY SWEET SPOT.

1580
00:57:14,098 --> 00:57:17,633
WELL, OUT OF MY RANGE, BUT

1581
00:57:17,635 --> 00:57:18,033
ATTAINABLE.

1582
00:57:18,035 --> 00:57:21,470
JUST SENT HER A RISKY TEXT.

1583
00:57:21,472 --> 00:57:22,804
SHE SAID, HOPPING IN THE SHOWER.

1584
00:57:22,806 --> 00:57:24,940
AND I SAID, WITHOUT ME?

1585
00:57:24,942 --> 00:57:25,240
HA HA.

SIT BACK AND ENJOY THE FLIGHT.

1591
00:57:34,451 --> 00:57:36,084
>> OKAY, WELL, THAT'S INSANE.

1592
00:57:36,086 --> 00:57:37,119
>> I KNOW.

1593
00:57:37,121 --> 00:57:41,223
SHE'S TOTALLY LEADING HIM ON.

1594
00:57:41,225 --> 00:57:42,524
HOPPING IN THE SHOWER!

1595
00:57:42,526 --> 00:57:45,727
OOH, I'M A LITTLE NAKED LADY,

1596
00:57:45,729 --> 00:57:48,664
HOPE I DON'T GET BUBBLES ON MY

1597
00:57:48,666 --> 00:57:50,432
BOOBIES!

1598
00:57:50,434 --> 00:57:50,766
WHORE.

>> CAPTAIN DAVE.

1600
00:57:51,535 --> 00:57:53,869
LOOKS LIKE WE'VE GOT ABOUT 576

1601
00:57:53,871 --> 00:57:55,103
PLANES IN FRONT OF US.

1602
00:57:55,105 --> 00:57:56,538
BUT GOOD NEWS IS MAN IN THE

1603
00:57:56,540 --> 00:57:58,307
TOWER SAYS HE'S ON TOP OF IT.

1604
00:57:58,309 --> 00:58:00,242
BAD NEWS IS, BY IT, I MEAN THE

1605
00:58:00,244 --> 00:58:01,109
TOWER ITSELF.

1606
00:58:01,111 --> 00:58:02,177
A COUPLE OF PEOPLE TRYING TO

1607
00:58:02,179 --> 00:58:02,945
TALK HIM DOWN.

1608
00:58:02,947 --> 00:58:04,346
BUT WE SHOULD HAVE YOU IN

1609
00:58:04,348 --> 00:58:06,748
CLEVELAND BY CHRISTMAS.

00:58:09,687 --> 00:58:12,054
DECIDED TO DOUBLE TEXT.

1613
00:58:12,056 --> 00:58:14,056
NOT GOING TO LIE, IT'S PRETTY

1614
00:58:14,058 --> 00:58:14,323
BAD.

1615
00:58:14,325 --> 00:58:16,525
SENT A GIF OF JACK NICHOLSON

1616
00:58:16,527 --> 00:58:18,660
KNOCKING DOWN THE DOOR IN "THE

1617
00:58:18,662 --> 00:58:19,027
SHINING."

1618
00:58:19,029 --> 00:58:21,597
POKING HIS HEAD IN, CAPTIONED

1619
00:58:21,599 --> 00:58:23,599
IT, "ME IF I WAS THERE RIGHT

1620
00:58:23,601 --> 00:58:24,132
NOW."

1621
00:58:24,134 --> 00:58:25,567
HATED IT AS SOON AS I SENT IT.

1622
00:58:25,569 --> 00:58:27,369
>> I TOLD YOU WHAT YOU NEED TO

1623
00:58:27,371 --> 00:58:29,204
SAY TO THIS GIRL IS --

1624
00:58:29,206 --> 00:58:31,006
>> YEAH, OKAY, WELL, THAT'S

1625
00:58:31,008 --> 00:58:31,373
COLORFUL.

1626
00:58:31,375 --> 00:58:33,375
FOLKS, FROM THE FLIGHT DECK,

1627
00:58:33,377 --> 00:58:34,743
BASICALLY THE GIST OF RITCHIE'S

1628
00:58:34,745 --> 00:58:36,078
PITCH WAS SOMETHING ABOUT

1629
00:58:36,080 --> 00:58:37,312
SLATHERING A CERTAIN PART OF HER

1630
00:58:37,314 --> 00:58:38,847
BODY IN BUTTER, THEN CRACKING

1631
00:58:38,849 --> 00:58:41,083
HER OPEN LIKE A CRAB LEG.

1632
00:58:41,085 --> 00:58:42,150
DON'T THINK I'LL TEXT THAT.

1633
00:58:42,152 --> 00:58:46,154
IF YOU HAVE ANY IDEAS, PLEASE

1634
00:58:46,156 --> 00:58:46,788
LET A FLIGHT ATTENDANT A

1635
00:58:46,790 --> 00:58:47,723

1641
00:58:56,500 --> 00:58:56,832
SHOWER.

1642
00:58:56,834 --> 00:58:57,699
>> TO SEE WHAT, SOMETHING I SEE

1643
00:58:57,701 --> 00:58:58,233
FOR FREE EVERY DAY?

1644
00:58:58,235 --> 00:59:01,603
NO THANK YOU.

1645
00:59:01,605 --> 00:59:03,572

NO NEWS FROM THE TOWER.

1649
00:59:06,744 --> 00:59:09,511
UPDATE FROM MY TEXT SAGA.

1650
00:59:09,513 --> 00:59:11,146
SHE JUST POSTED ON HER STORIES,

1651
00:59:11,148 --> 00:59:13,749
SO SHE IS ON HER PHONE.

1652
00:59:13,751 --> 00:59:17,552
AND -- I AM IN HELL.

1653
00:59:17,554 --> 00:59:19,187
>> I'M TELLING YOU, ALL YOU NEED

1654
00:59:19,189 --> 00:59:20,956

00:59:20,958 --> 00:59:21,957
>> UH-HUH.

1656
00:59:21,959 --> 00:59:22,257
RIGHT.

1657
00:59:22,259 --> 00:59:22,591
UH-HUH.

1658
00:59:22,593 --> 00:59:24,793
I CAN'T SAY ANY OF THOSE WORDS.

1659
00:59:24,795 --> 00:59:26,662
YOU KNOW, I WOULD LOVE TO HEAR A

1660
00:59:26,664 --> 00:59:27,696
WOMAN'S PERSPECTIVE.

1661
00:59:27,698 --> 00:59:28,930
MAYBE EVEN A GAY GUY.

1662
00:59:28,932 --> 00:59:31,266
ONE OF THE NICE ONES, THOUGH.

1663
00:59:31,268 --> 00:59:32,801
NOT A GYM GAY.

1664
00:59:32,803 --> 00:59:34,336
