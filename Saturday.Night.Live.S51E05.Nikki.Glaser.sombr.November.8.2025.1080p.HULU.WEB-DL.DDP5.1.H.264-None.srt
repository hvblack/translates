1
00:00:02,414 --> 00:00:04,106
EARLIER

2
00:00:11,447 --> 00:00:15,704
>>> HELLO.
I'D LIKE TO THANK PRESIDENT
TRUMP FOR HAVING US.

3
00:00:15,803 --> 00:00:20,625
THOSE OF US FROM THE
PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY
ARE
HONORED TO BE HERE TODAY

4
00:00:20,625 --> 00:00:25,384
ALONGSIDE RFK JR. AND DR. OZ.

5
00:00:25,384 --> 00:00:30,112
WE'RE GOING TO DISCUSS LOWERING
THE PRICE OF WEIGHT LOSS DRUGS.

6
00:00:30,112 --> 00:00:32,781
FOR YEARS, MY COMPANY, ELI LILLY,

7
00:00:32,781 --> 00:00:37,792
HAS BEEN AT THE FOREFRONT
OF PROVIDING AMERICANS WITH --

8
00:00:37,792 --> 00:00:40,541
>> OH, NO!

9
00:00:43,461 --> 00:00:46,356
>> OH, HI.
DIDN'T SEE YOU THERE.

10
00:00:46,356 --> 00:00:48,683
SOMEONE WAS DYING IN MY OFFICE.

11
00:00:48,683 --> 00:00:50,757
I THINK I'M PLAYING THIS VERY
NORMAL.

12
00:00:50,757 --> 00:00:54,507
JUST STAND THERE AND STARE LIKE
A SOCIOPATH.

13
00:00:54,507 --> 00:00:56,524
PRETEND LIKE I WAS GOING TO HELP,

14
00:00:56,524 --> 00:00:59,710
SOMEONE DROPS SOMETHING
AND YOU DO THE FAKE BEND, OH,

15
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:03,768
LET ME HELP YOU PICK THAT UP,
YOU GOT IT

16
00:01:03,768 --> 00:01:09,024
RFK OUT OF HERE LIKE
SOMEONE WAS TRYING TO GIVE HIM A
VACCINE.

17
00:01:09,024 --> 00:01:11,290
BRAINWORM, TAKE THE WHEEL!

18
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:14,576
THAT THING RATATOUILLE'D HIM OUT
OF THE ROOM.

19
00:01:14,576 --> 00:01:18,263
EACH WEEK, I LIKE TO CREATE A
BIG VISUAL

20
00:01:18,263 --> 00:01:20,321
THAT SUMS UP HOW
THINGS ARE GOING.

21
00:01:20,321 --> 00:01:23,157
LAST WEEK IT WAS THE DEMOLISHING
OF THE EAST WING.

22
00:01:23,157 --> 00:01:27,108
THIS WEEK IT'S A MEDICAL
PROFESSIONAL ALMOST DYING IN MY OVAL OFFICE

23
00:01:27,108 --> 00:01:29,908
AT THE MERE THOUGHT
OF CHARGING LESS FOR DRUGS.

24
00:01:29,908 --> 00:01:33,097
MAYBE NEXT WEEK A BALD EAGLE
WILL FALL DEAD OUT OF THE SKY

25
00:01:33,097 --> 00:01:35,328
AND SPLAT RIGHT ON THE WHITE
HOUSE LAWN.

26
00:01:35,328 --> 00:01:39,550
BY LAWN I MEAN BIG OUTDOOR
CONCRETE FLOOR.

27
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:41,415
THERE?

28
00:01:41,415 --> 00:01:44,005
MORE IMPORTANTLY, HOW'S THE
FLOOR?
OKAY?

29
00:01:44,005 --> 00:01:48,810
A GUY COLLAPSING IN THE OVAL
OFFICE, WHO'D HAVE THOUGHT IT
WOULD BE NOT ME.

30
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:53,198
DON'T WORRY, HE'LL BE FINE.
DR. OZ IS ON THE CASE.

31
00:01:53,198 --> 00:01:57,016
ANYWAY, ALL IN ALL A GREAT,
AWESOME WEEK

32
00:01:57,016 --> 00:02:00,149
EXCEPT FOR
ELECTION.
THE DEMOCRATS WON.

33
00:02:00,149 --> 00:02:04,809
THE LAMESTREAM MEDIA CALLED THE
ELECTIONS A REBUKE OF TRUMP'S
POLICIES.

34
00:02:04,809 --> 00:02:08,868
JOKE'S ON THEM, THEY'RE STEPHEN
MILLER'S POLICIES, I DON'T READ
THAT STUFF.

35
00:02:08,868 --> 00:02:11,505
NO LIKEE READEE.

36
00:02:11,505 --> 00:02:14,216
CAN'T BELIEVE THEY ELECTED
MAMDANI.

37
00:02:14,216 --> 00:02:16,105
WE LIKE TO SAY, MAMDANI.

38
00:02:16,105 --> 00:02:20,221
I'M TORN BECAUSE I LIKE A WINNER
BUT I'M NOT CRAZY ABOUT A
MUSLIM.

39
00:02:20,221 --> 00:02:22,439
MAYBE HE'LL CONVERT.

40
00:02:22,439 --> 00:02:27,256
WE'LL PUT HIM IN LINE BEHIND
URSHA VANCE, AND I HOPE I'M
PRONOUNCING THAT WRONG.

41
00:02:27,256 --> 00:02:29,794
OUR SIDE HAD SOME WINS THIS
WEEK, TOO.

42
00:02:29,794 --> 00:02:32,788
THE SUPREME COURT SAID WE COULD
STOP FEEDING POOR PEOPLE.

43
00:02:32,788 --> 00:02:36,555
YOU CAN CLAP FOR THAT.
S.N.A.P.!

44
00:02:36,555 --> 00:02:38,302
S.N.A.P.!

45
00:02:38,302 --> 00:02:42,342
FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO CAN AFFORD
FOOD, NO, YOU CAN'T.

46
00:02:42,342 --> 00:02:45,099
I PROMISED GROCERY PRICES WOULD
PLUMMET,

47
00:02:45,099 --> 00:02:47,459
AND THEY DID, THEY
PLUMMETED STRAIGHT UP.

48
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:53,040
PEOPLE ARE SAYING, BUT SIR, HOW
WILL I AFFORD MY THANKSGIVING
TURKEY FOR MY FAMILY?

49
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:57,072
WELL, GOOD NEWS IS YOUR FAMILY'S
NOT COMING BECAUSE ALL THE
PLANES ARE GONE.

50
00:02:57,072 --> 00:03:00,287
WE CALL THAT PROBLEM SOLVING
PROBLEM.

51
00:03:00,287 --> 00:03:05,137
KILLING TWO BIRDS WITH ANOTHER
BIRD.
NOW YOU GOT A BUNCH OF CRAZY
BIRDS.

52
00:03:05,137 --> 00:03:07,835
WE LIKE IT, WE LIKE IT, THAT'S
KIND OF OUR THING.

53
00:03:07,835 --> 00:03:10,137
CAN'T AFFORD FOOD, HAVE SOME
CHEAP OZEMPIC.

54
00:03:10,137 --> 00:03:14,583
NOW YOU'RE NOT HUNGRY AND YOU
GET TO TAKE ONE WEIRD, PAINFUL
POOP A WEEK.

55
00:03:14,583 --> 00:03:17,094
HOW'S IT GOING BACK THERE?
IS HE DEAD?

56
00:03:17,094 --> 00:03:22,322
THEY'RE DOING THE -- THEY GOT
THE LEGS UP, THAT MEANS DEAD IN
CARTOON.

57
00:03:22,322 --> 00:03:25,353
ACTUALLY, DON'T TELL ME IF HE'S
DEAD, I WANT TO BE SURPRISED.

58
00:03:25,353 --> 00:03:27,975
ANYWAY.
GOVERNMENT IS STILL SHUT DOWN.

59
00:03:27,975 --> 00:03:30,763
ALL THANKS TO THE DEMOCRATS AND
SOME REPUBLICANS

60
00:03:30,763 --> 00:03:32,923
AND ALL
REPUBLICANS AND ME.

61
00:03:32,923 --> 00:03:37,406
PEOPLE SAY, JUST CAVE, DON, GIVE
THE DEMOCRATS WHAT THEY WANT,
END THIS.

62
00:03:37,406 --> 00:03:40,760
I THINK WE'RE GOING TO DRAG IT
OUT.
WE'RE GOING TO KEEP THE
GOVERNMENT SHUT DOWN.

63
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:45,123
WE'RE LOOKING INTO PERHAPS
STEALING CHRISTMAS.
WE'LL BE DOING GRINCH.

64
00:03:45,123 --> 00:03:47,135
I LIKE THE GRINCH.
HE'S A GREAT GUY.

65
00:03:47,135 --> 00:03:49,775
OUR WIVES ARE FRIENDS.
WE PLAY GOLF SOMETIMES.

66
00:03:49,775 --> 00:03:51,910
IS HE OKAY?
HE'S OKAY, ALL RIGHT.

67
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:53,833
WELL, IF YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE
HIM TO GET AN MRI,

68
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:56,815
USE THIS,
THIS IS MY PUNCH CARD.

69
00:03:56,815 --> 00:03:59,026
ONE MORE AND THE NEXT ONE'S
FREE.

70
00:03:59,026 --> 00:04:02,868
AND FOR ANYONE WORRIED ABOUT THE
STATE OF THE COUNTRY, I'LL SAY THE SAME THING

71
00:04:02,868 --> 00:04:06,086
I SAID TO MELANIA
WHEN SHE TRIED TO HELP ME DO MY
HAIR.

72
00:04:06,086 --> 00:04:08,792
GO AWAY, WHAT I'M DOING IS VERY
COMPLICATED,

73
00:04:08,792 --> 00:04:10,538
AND ONLY I KNOW HOW
TO DO IT.

74
00:04:10,538 --> 00:04:14,472
AND LIVE FROM NEW YORK, IT'S
SATURDAY NIGHT!

75
00:06:17,336 --> 00:06:21,270
MUSICAL

76
00:06:21,999 --> 00:06:26,506
HOST

77
00:06:29,195 --> 00:06:34,739
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN -- NIKKI
GLASER!

78
00:06:56,091 --> 00:06:59,896
>> THANK YOU!
THANK YOU, THANK YOU SO MUCH.

79
00:06:59,896 --> 00:07:04,168
HI, I AM NIKKI GLASER, AND I AM
SO HAPPY TO BE HERE TONIGHT.

80
00:07:04,168 --> 00:07:06,441
THIS IS TRULY A DREAM COME TRUE.

81
00:07:06,441 --> 00:07:08,696
I LOVE THIS SHOW SO MUCH.

82
00:07:08,696 --> 00:07:10,652
AND HERE I AM IN NEW YORK CITY,

83
00:07:10,652 --> 00:07:13,532
EPSTEIN'S ORIGINAL ISLAND.

84
00:07:14,223 --> 00:07:18,717
OH, IT'S SUCH A SPECIAL NIGHT.
I GOT A SPRAY TAN TONIGHT.

85
00:07:18,717 --> 00:07:21,743
THANK YOU, IT DESERVES THAT,
THANK YOU.

86
00:07:21,743 --> 00:07:25,901
THERE'S SO MANY PASTY WHITE
GIRLS WHO ARE TERRIFIED TO GET SPRAY TANS,

87
00:07:25,901 --> 00:07:28,499
I'M GOING TO LOOK
ORANGE.

88
00:07:28,499 --> 00:07:32,223
JUST -- BELIEVE ME, I PROMISE
YOU, I PROMISE YOU --

89
00:07:32,317 --> 00:07:35,134
IT'S
BETTER THAN WHAT YOU ARE, OKAY?

90
00:07:35,134 --> 00:07:38,419
DON'T BE SCARED.
THEY'RE ALWAYS LIKE, I'M GOING
TO LOOK LIKE TRUMP!

91
00:07:38,419 --> 00:07:41,072
BITCH, THAT'S WHY HE WON.

92
00:07:41,072 --> 00:07:45,801
YEAH, HE PICKED AN INSANE SHADE.
HE WENT PRETTY DARK.

93
00:07:45,801 --> 00:07:48,893
HE DIDN'T GO KAMALA, BUT HE
PICKED A SHADE THAT

94
00:07:48,893 --> 00:07:52,938
HALF OF
AMERICA WAS LIKE, OKAY, WE CAN
STILL TELL HE'S WHITE. SO,

95
00:07:52,938 --> 00:07:57,764
I MEAN, IT IS KIND OF INSANE
THAT WHITE PEOPLE CAN JUST PAINT
THEIR SKIN A DIFFERENT COLOR

96
00:07:57,764 --> 00:08:00,279
AND
THEY'RE LIKE, THIS IS COOL,
RIGHT?

97
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:03,682
I FEEL LIKE THAT'S CULTURAL
APPROPRIATION.
I DON'T KNOW. I MEAN,

98
00:08:03,682 --> 00:08:07,433
IT'S NOT BLACKFACE, BUT
IT IS GUATEMALAN LEG.

99
00:08:07,433 --> 00:08:10,242
THIS IS NOT MY LEG.

100
00:08:10,242 --> 00:08:13,245
I'M LIKE, OH, MY GOD, ME, I'M
ALWAYS NIKKI,

101
00:08:13,245 --> 00:08:16,129
LOOK AT THAT.
AM I SAYING THAT
RIGHT?

102
00:08:16,129 --> 00:08:19,802
I GET SHE'S SPRAY TANS.
I BREATHE THE STUFF IN EVERY
WEEK.

103
00:08:19,802 --> 00:08:22,658
I AM DEFINITELY GOING TO GET
SOME KIND OF RESPIRATORY ILLNESS
FROM IT.

104
00:08:22,658 --> 00:08:26,992
IN 20 YEARS THERE'S GOING TO BE
SOME EPIDEMIC CALLED TAN LUNG.

105
00:08:26,992 --> 00:08:31,198
I REALLY WANT TO BE ON THE
COMMERCIALS FOR THE CLASS ACTION
LAWSUIT.

106
00:08:31,198 --> 00:08:33,407
I THINK THAT'S SUCH A GOOD GIG.

107
00:08:33,407 --> 00:08:35,030
IT WILL BE SO FUN FOR YOU, TOO.

108
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:37,896
YOU'LL TURN ON YOUR TV IN THE
MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT AND BE, WHO
IS THAT?

109
00:08:37,896 --> 00:08:40,210
I'LL BE, LIKE, I'M NIKKI GLASER.

110
00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:44,524
YOU MAY RECOGNIZE ME FROM THE
ROAST OF TOM BRADY.

111
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:48,210
IT WILL BE LIKE ME AND SNOOKI.
THAT'S FUN.

112
00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:52,914
JUST TALKING THROUGH OUR TRACHS,
RFK JUNIOR'ing OUT.

113
00:08:52,914 --> 00:08:55,749
HE'S GOT TAN LUNG. I MEAN,

114
00:08:55,749 --> 00:08:58,140
HE'S STAGE 2, I DON'T
KNOW.

115
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:02,178
I'M NO HEALTH EXPERT, BUT
NOTWITHSTANDINGER IS HE.

116
00:09:02,178 --> 00:09:05,440
IT'S JUST CRAZY WE HAVE TO WORRY
ABOUT OUR LOOKS SO MUCH.

117
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,911
IT STARTS SO YOUNG AS A GIRL.

118
00:09:07,911 --> 00:09:10,650
I SAW THIS GIRL THE OTHER DAY.
SHE WAS PROBABLY 6 YEARS OLD.

119
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:12,852
AND HER DAD WAS TRYING TO TAKE A
PICTURE OF HER.

120
00:09:12,852 --> 00:09:14,497
McKENZIE, LOOK OVER HERE.

121
00:09:14,497 --> 00:09:17,000
DAD, GET MY GOOD SIDE.

122
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,951
SHE'S LIKE, "GOOD SIDE."
6.

123
00:09:19,951 --> 00:09:22,110
SO SAD, BECAUSE SHE DIDN'T HAVE
ONE.

124
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:25,018
IT'S LIKE, WHEN IS SHE GOING TO
FIND OUT?

125
00:09:25,018 --> 00:09:27,942
SHE NEEDS TO LEARN A TRADE, YOU
KNOW?

126
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:31,963
HAND HER A WRENCH OR DO COMEDY.
I DON'T KNOW.

127
00:09:31,963 --> 00:09:35,982
I JUST THINK THERE'S SO MANY
THINGS WE DO FOR BEAUTY THAT ARE IMPORTANT,

128
00:09:35,982 --> 00:09:38,278
BUT THERE'S OTHER
ONES I'M LIKE, WHY ARE WE DOING
THIS?

129
00:09:38,278 --> 00:09:41,159
WHO CARES?
LIKE NAILS.
NO ONE CARES.

130
00:09:41,159 --> 00:09:43,131
LIKE, I'VE BEEN WITH MY
BOYFRIEND FOR TEN YEARS.

131
00:09:43,131 --> 00:09:45,705
HE'S NEVER ONCE NOTICED THAT
I'VE GOTTEN MY NAILS DONE.

132
00:09:45,705 --> 00:09:48,939
AND THEY GO INSIDE HIM.
SO IF HE DOESN'T CARE,

133
00:09:48,939 --> 00:09:51,539
WHO DOES?

134
00:09:52,141 --> 00:09:55,896
THE ONLY TIME HE CARED WAS WHEN
I WAS THEM BEDAZZLED FOR HIS
PLEASURE.

135
00:09:55,896 --> 00:09:58,551
THEN HE LOVED THEM.

136
00:09:58,551 --> 00:10:01,416
GOING TO THE NAIL SALON, IT'S SO
BORING.

137
00:10:01,416 --> 00:10:02,733
IT'S SUCH A WASTE OF TIME.

138
00:10:02,733 --> 00:10:05,770
YOU JUST SIT THERE FOR TWO HOURS
JUST PARALYZED.

139
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:08,391
I FEEL LIKE MEN THINK WE GO TO
THE NAIL SALON WITH OUR GIRLFRIENDS

140
00:10:08,391 --> 00:10:10,955
AND CHITCHAT THE
WHOLE TIME, BUT THAT'S NOT THE
CASE.

141
00:10:10,955 --> 00:10:12,685
YOU CAN GO TO THE NAIL SALON
WITH A FRIEND,

142
00:10:12,685 --> 00:10:14,499
BUT YOU GET
SEPARATED AT THE BORDER.

143
00:10:14,499 --> 00:10:17,809
THEY DO NOT LET YOU SIT NEXT TO
EACH OTHER.
IT'S SO ANTISOCIAL.

144
00:10:17,810 --> 00:10:21,684
WATCHING
ON MUTE

145
00:10:21,684 --> 00:10:24,874
YOU CAN'T TALK TO THE WOMAN
DOING YOUR NAILS, BECAUSE

146
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:26,707
SLAVERY?
I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW.

147
00:10:26,707 --> 00:10:31,288
SHE SEEMS STUCK AND SAD.
I DON'T KNOW.

148
00:10:31,288 --> 00:10:33,162
I THINK I'M JUST PARANOID.

149
00:10:33,162 --> 00:10:36,241
I'M JUST KIND OF OBSESSED WITH
SLAVERY RECENTLY, BECAUSE --

150
00:10:36,241 --> 00:10:41,220
EVERY TIME YOU GO TO A WOMEN'S
RESTROOM, A PUBLIC WOMEN'S
RESTROOM, IN THE STALL

151
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:45,578
THERE'S A
POSTER ON THE BACK OF THE STALL
ASKING YOU IF YOU'RE BEING
TRAFFICKED.

152
00:10:45,578 --> 00:10:48,533
WOMEN, WE HAVE THESE, RIGHT?
YES, YES.

153
00:10:48,533 --> 00:10:51,407
IN EVERY STALL, IN EVERY WORLD
LANGUAGE.

154
00:10:51,407 --> 00:10:55,285
ENGLISH IS REALLY TINY AND IT'S
LIKE, "YOU WISH."
BUT IT'S LIKE --

155
00:10:56,645 --> 00:11:00,089
MEN'SEST
RESTROOMS DO NOT HAVE THESE
SIGNS.

156
00:11:00,089 --> 00:11:02,802
I DON'T KNOW WHAT SIGNS YOU
HAVE. MAYBE YOU HAVE SIGNS LIKE,

157
00:11:02,802 --> 00:11:07,400
"WANT
A SLAVE?
TEXT "TRAFFIC" TO 6969."

158
00:11:08,081 --> 00:11:11,020
BUT IT'S REALLY A BIG FEAR OF
BEING TRAFFICKED.

159
00:11:11,122 --> 00:11:13,076
MOSTLY FOR GEN-Z GIRLS.

160
00:11:13,076 --> 00:11:15,478
I HAVE A LOT OF GEN-Z FRIENDS
THAT I BOUGHT.

161
00:11:15,478 --> 00:11:18,384
THEY'RE TERRIFIED.

162
00:11:18,384 --> 00:11:20,682
AND I DON'T RELATE.
I'M 41.

163
00:11:20,682 --> 00:11:23,141
THAT WAS LIKE NOT A FEAR OF MINE
EVER IN MY 20s.

164
00:11:23,265 --> 00:11:26,541
IN MY 20s I JUST FEARED GOOD
OLD-FASHIONED RAPE.

165
00:11:26,541 --> 00:11:30,136
I DIDN'T THINK IT WOULD BE A
CAREER.
WE DIDN'T THINK --

166
00:11:30,136 --> 00:11:34,649
IT WAS ANYTHING MORE THAN A TEMP
JOB AT A FRAT HOUSE FUTON. BUT

167
00:11:34,649 --> 00:11:38,180
IT'S REAL.
I'M GETTING SCARED.
IT'S RUBBING OUT WITH ME.

168
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:41,274
RECENTLY
WHAT IF WE GET TRAFFICKED?

169
00:11:41,274 --> 00:11:44,061
THEY'RE LIKE, "YOU'RE GOOD."

170
00:11:45,021 --> 00:11:47,091
THEY'RE LIKE, "WE'RE SAFER WHEN
YOU'RE WITH US

171
00:11:47,091 --> 00:11:50,426
BECAUSE THEY
THINK YOU'RE OUR MADAM."

172
00:11:50,426 --> 00:11:53,685
"YOU HAVE RESTING GHISLAINE"
FACE, SO KEEP THAT UP."

173
00:11:53,685 --> 00:11:55,556
WHAT?

174
00:11:55,556 --> 00:11:59,720
I'M GOING TO GET IT FIXED.
I'M GOING TO GET A FACELIFT
PRETTY SOON HERE.

175
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:03,026
MY BOYFRIEND DOESN'T WANT ME TO.
HE'S LIKE, NO, DON'T DO YOUR FACE,

176
00:12:03,026 --> 00:12:06,082
I LOVE YOUR FACE, DO YOUR
TITS.

177
00:12:06,082 --> 00:12:07,516
WHAT?

178
00:12:07,516 --> 00:12:11,233
THAT'S ALL HE CARES ABOUT.
HE'S A SHORT GUY, THEY'RE ALL HE
SEES, I THINK.

179
00:12:11,233 --> 00:12:13,491
I THINK THAT'S WHY HE'S FOCUSED
ON THEM.

180
00:12:13,491 --> 00:12:17,613
I DO DATE A SHORT GUY, SHORTER
THAN ME, BUT REALLY HOT.

181
00:12:17,613 --> 00:12:19,562
I THINK THAT'S WHY I GOT HIM,

182
00:12:19,562 --> 00:12:22,714
BECAUSE I COULD NEVER GET HIS
FACE ON A TALLER MODEL.

183
00:12:22,714 --> 00:12:26,652
LIKE, IF YOU WANT TO GET A 10 IN
THE FACE, YOU'VE GOT TO GO 5'7"
IN THE HEIGHT.

184
00:12:26,652 --> 00:12:30,717
TRICK
GETTING A HOT GUY ON DISCOUNT.
HE'S MARKED DOWN.

185
00:12:30,717 --> 00:12:34,236
I MET MY BOYFRIEND AT TJ MAXX,
CLEARANCE RACK,

186
00:12:34,236 --> 00:12:36,100
HE WAS HIDING IN
IT.

187
00:12:36,836 --> 00:12:39,863
IT'S CRAZY.
SOMETIMES I'LL POST A PICTURE OF US ONLINE

188
00:12:39,863 --> 00:12:43,657
AND I'LL GET COMMENTS
OF, GIRL, HE'S HOT, HOW DID YOU
GET HIM?

189
00:12:43,657 --> 00:12:46,459
I'M LIKE, IF YOU ZOOMED OUT,
YOU'D SEE HE'S SITTING ON MY
LAP.

190
00:12:46,459 --> 00:12:49,404
THIS IS A TINY GUY.

191
00:12:49,404 --> 00:12:52,261
WENT DIGGING IN THE BARGAIN BIN,
LADIES.

192
00:12:52,261 --> 00:12:56,046
BUT -- YEAH, GIRLS DON'T LIKE
SHORT GUYS.

193
00:12:56,046 --> 00:12:58,915
AND I GUESS IT'S BECAUSE YOU
WANT A TALL GUY

194
00:12:58,915 --> 00:13:01,540
SO THAT YOU CAN
FEEL LIKE, HE CAN PROTECT ME,

195
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:05,085
AND MURDER ME SOMEDAY.
I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S IT.

196
00:13:05,085 --> 00:13:08,206
BUT MY BOYFRIEND'S SHORTER THAN
ME.
I'VE NEVER FELT LIKE HE CAN'T PROTECT ME,

197
00:13:08,206 --> 00:13:11,023
AND I AM CERTAIN HE
WILL MURDER ME SOMEDAY.

198
00:13:11,023 --> 00:13:13,774
HE IS SO FILLED WITH RAGE THAT
HE'S SHORT.

199
00:13:13,774 --> 00:13:16,508
I MEAN, HE IS JUST SIMMERING
WITH ANGER.

200
00:13:16,508 --> 00:13:20,632
AND THAT'S WHY I KEEP OUR GUN ON
THE TOP SHELF.
I CAN'T RISK THAT.

201
00:13:20,632 --> 00:13:24,635
I NEED HIM TO GO GET A
STEPLADDER AND THINK IT THROUGH,
YOU KNOW?

202
00:13:24,635 --> 00:13:29,289
THE NUMBER OF TIMES I'VE WALKED
INTO OUR CLOSET AND SEEN HIM
LIKE --

203
00:13:30,228 --> 00:13:32,900
AND I'M LIKE, "DOES SOMEONE NEED
TO GET UPPY-UPPY

204
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:36,972
TO GET THE
BANG-BANG TO MAKE NIKKI GO
BYE-BYE?"

205
00:13:36,972 --> 00:13:40,639
THEN I GIVE HIM A JUICE BOX, AND
HE FORGETS WHY HE'S UPSET.

206
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:44,071
WE DON'T HAVE KIDS BECAUSE I
DON'T WANT TO PASS DOWN THAT
DNA.

207
00:13:44,071 --> 00:13:48,066
BUT IT'S JUST -- I FEEL LIKE
IT'S TOO HARD TO BE A MOM.

208
00:13:48,066 --> 00:13:51,562
I HAVE TOO MUCH ANXIETY ABOUT
IT.
IT'S HARD BEING AN AUNT.

209
00:13:51,562 --> 00:13:53,939
I WAS STAYING AT MY SISTER'S
HOUSE RECENTLY,

210
00:13:53,939 --> 00:13:56,108
AND AT ONE POINT
I WAS LIKE, "I'M GOING TO GO
TAKE A SHOWER."

211
00:13:56,108 --> 00:14:00,059
MY NEPHEW COMES RUNNING IN, "I
TAKE A SHOWER WITH YOU!"

212
00:14:00,059 --> 00:14:01,206
HE'S 18.

213
00:14:01,206 --> 00:14:05,181
I'M LIKE, WHAT'S GOING ON WITH
HIS VOICE?

214
00:14:05,181 --> 00:14:06,677
SOMETHING'S WRONG.

215
00:14:06,677 --> 00:14:09,530
NO, NO.
HE WAS 4, AND IT WAS VERY CUTE.

216
00:14:09,530 --> 00:14:12,233
MY SISTER'S LIKE, HE CAN TAKE A
SHOWER WITH YOU, IT'S FINE, HE
DOES IT WITH US.

217
00:14:12,233 --> 00:14:13,773
OKAY, THAT'S FINE FOR YOU GUYS

218
00:14:13,773 --> 00:14:18,209
BUT ARE YOU OKAY WITHN AN ADULT
SHOWERING WITH YOUR CHILD?

219
00:14:18,209 --> 00:14:21,191
MAYBE IT'S OKAY IF YOU COME AND
SUPERVISE.

220
00:14:21,191 --> 00:14:25,649
SHE WAS LIKE, WHY?
AND I WAS LIKE, WHAT AM.
I MOLEST HIM?

221
00:14:29,387 --> 00:14:32,622
SHE WAS LIKE, WOULD YOU?
I WAS LIKE, NO!

222
00:14:32,622 --> 00:14:34,891
I WOULD NEVER!
THAT'S DISGUSTING!

223
00:14:34,891 --> 00:14:36,581
BUT THAT'S WHAT I'D SAY IF I WAS
GONNA.

224
00:14:36,581 --> 00:14:40,497
THEY LIE!
DON'T TRUST ANYONE.

225
00:14:40,497 --> 00:14:43,287
I DON'T EVEN TRUST MYSELF.
I DON'T WANT TO GO IN THERE.

226
00:14:43,287 --> 00:14:47,634
HOW DO YOU BECOME A PEDESTRIAN
TILE?
YOU DON'T GET TO CHOOSE WHAT
YOU'RE INTO, DUDE.

227
00:14:47,634 --> 00:14:51,170
WHAT IF IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS
YOU DON'T KNOW YOU LIKE TILL YOU
GET IN THERE AND YOU'RE LIKE,

228
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:52,474
WELL, THIS IS MY THING.

229
00:14:52,474 --> 00:14:56,265
AND IT OPENS UP A PART OF MY
BRAIN.
NO, NO, NO.

230
00:14:56,265 --> 00:14:59,971
I KNOW THAT SOUNDS CRAZY, BUT
THERE HAVE BEEN SO MANY THINGS IN MY LIFE

231
00:14:59,971 --> 00:15:03,737
THAT I'VE BEEN, I
WOULD NEVER DO THAT.

232
00:15:03,737 --> 00:15:07,499
AND NOW I'M LIKE, LOOKS KIND OF
FUN, ACTUALLY.
SO I DON'T KNOW.

233
00:15:07,499 --> 00:15:09,027
THANK YOU GUYS SO MUCH.

234
00:15:09,027 --> 00:15:12,558
WE HAVE SUCH AN INCREDIBLE SHOW
FOR YOU TONIGHT.

235
00:15:12,558 --> 00:15:14,439
SOMBR IS HERE.

236
00:15:14,439 --> 00:15:18,112
SO STICK AROUND, AND WE'LL BE
RIGHT BACK!

237
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:45,483
>>> I TRIED TO TELL HER, BABE,
YOU REALLY DON'T HAVE TO DO
THIS.

238
00:15:45,483 --> 00:15:49,035
>> ARE YOU KIDDING?
I LOVE THAT YOU GUYS DO FAMILY
KARAOKE NIGHTS,

239
00:15:49,035 --> 00:15:50,903
THAT'S SO SWEET.

240
00:15:50,903 --> 00:15:53,051
>> AWW, PETEY, I LIKE HER
ALREADY.

241
00:15:53,051 --> 00:15:55,543
>> THANKS FOR COMING TO OUR
LITTLE FAMILY TRADITION.

242
00:15:55,543 --> 00:15:57,635
>> I KNOW IT'S SILLY, BUT WE
LOVE IT.

243
00:15:57,635 --> 00:16:00,462
>> I'M JUST EXCITED TO MEET YOU
GUYS.

244
00:16:00,462 --> 00:16:04,578
>> ALL RIGHT, PARTY PEOPLE,
DEEJAY FIG-A-LICIOUS ON THE MIC.

245
00:16:04,578 --> 00:16:08,491
IF YOU ARE THE OWNER OF A 2004 COROLLA,

246
00:16:08,491 --> 00:16:11,402
PLEASE TALK TO ME, I'M
CONSIDERING BUYING ONE.

247
00:16:11,402 --> 00:16:15,604
ALL RIGHT, NOW GIVE IT UP FOR
BECKY AND PETEY!

248
00:16:15,604 --> 00:16:17,491
>> WAIT, YOU PUT IN OUR SONG
ALREADY?

249
00:16:17,491 --> 00:16:19,631
>> YOU KNOW I DID, LITTLE BRO,
GET UP THERE.

250
00:16:19,631 --> 00:16:21,860
>> OH, MY GOD.
I'M SORRY, BABE, DUTY CALLS.

251
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:24,074
>> HAVE FUN!

252
00:16:26,730 --> 00:16:30,368
>> THIS IS FOR MY BABY BROTHER.
I LOVE YOU, BUDDY.

253
00:16:30,368 --> 00:16:32,464

GO HOME RIGHT NOW ¶

259
00:16:50,502 --> 00:16:51,963
>> NEVER.

>> GO, KIDS!

271
00:17:35,952 --> 00:17:38,835
KIDS

272
00:17:40,075 --> 00:17:43,936
>> AND THEY'RE FULL SIBLINGS?

273

276
00:17:51,438 --> 00:17:52,908
IT'S PETEY AND BECKY.

277
00:17:52,908 --> 00:17:56,031
>> WHAT?
OH, MY GOSH.
DID YOU PUT ONE IN TOO?

278
00:17:56,031 --> 00:18:00,062
>> OF COURSE I DID, SIS, COME

>> OH, MY GOSH.

279

331
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:44,444
HAVE YOU STOPPED FEELING LIKE
YOURSELF?

332
00:20:44,444 --> 00:20:49,054
ARE YOU OVERCOME WITH AN INTENSE
FEELING OF FOREBODING AND DREAD?

333
00:20:49,054 --> 00:20:52,285
IF SO, YOU MAY BE ONE OF THE
MANY CELEBRITIES

334
00:20:52,285 --> 00:20:56,688
WHO ARE
SCHEDULED TO DANCE THROUGH THE
JENNIFER HUDSON SPIRIT TUNNEL.

335
00:21:01,703 --> 00:21:03,410
>> I LOVE JENNIFER HUDSON.

336
00:21:03,504 --> 00:21:06,670
BUT AS AN UNCOORDINATED WHITE
WOMAN, I FELT TRAPPED.

337
00:21:06,670 --> 00:21:11,163
I'D TRIED PRACTICING, BUT
EVERYTHING I CAME UP WITH LOOKED
CAREER-ENDING.

338
00:21:11,163 --> 00:21:13,812
POINTING.
SHOULDER SHRUG.

339
00:21:13,812 --> 00:21:15,544
DRUNK AUNT AT A WEDDING.

340
00:21:15,544 --> 00:21:17,680
I EVEN TRIED TO PUT MY ASS INTO

341
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:19,716
BUT I DON'T HAVE ONE.

342
00:21:19,716 --> 00:21:23,536
I JUST KEPT IMAGINING MYSELF IN
THAT TUNNEL.

343
00:21:23,536 --> 00:21:25,944
¶ COME ON NIKKI YOU'RE SO FINE
YOU'RE SO FINE

344
00:21:25,944 --> 00:21:29,171
YOU BLOW MY MIND
HEY NIKKI HEY NIKKI ¶

345
00:21:29,386 --> 00:21:31,411
>> IT FELT LIKE THERE WAS NO WAY
OUT.

346
00:21:31,411 --> 00:21:34,464
THAT'S WHEN MY DOCTOR TOLD ME
ABOUT HUDSICILLIN.

347
00:21:34,464 --> 00:21:39,567
HUDSICILLIN IS THE
ONLY MEDICATION PROVED TO KILL
SPIRIT TUNNEL RELATED SYMPTOMS

348
00:21:39,567 --> 00:21:41,103
WORKS

349
00:21:41,103 --> 00:21:42,998
NOT BY MAKING YOUR BODY AWAY

350
00:21:42,998 --> 00:21:45,438
BIT BY MAKING YOU SO VIOLENTLY ILL.

351
00:21:45,438 --> 00:21:47,372
YOU HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO
CANCEL.

352
00:21:47,372 --> 00:21:50,419
IT WORKS FAST, MAYBE TOO FAST.

353
00:21:50,419 --> 00:21:54,580
30 SECONDS AFTER MY FIRST DOSE,
I WAS SHAKING ON THE BATHROOM
FLOOR.

354
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:57,052
NOT KNOWING WHICH END OF ME TO
AIM AT THE TOILET.

355
00:21:57,052 --> 00:22:00,074
THAT'S BECAUSE HUDSICILLIN IS
MADE FROM A GENTLE BLEND

356
00:22:00,074 --> 00:22:04,096
OF E.
COLI, INFLUENZA, C. DIFF.
AND RANCID BUTTERMILK.

357

358
00:22:06,563 --> 00:22:10,065
AND NOW MY SPOT IN THE TUNNEL
CAN GO TO SOMEONE WHO REALLY
WANTS IT.

UNDERSTAND.

HE'S NOT JUST ANY BEAST.

>> WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?

379
00:23:43,844 --> 00:23:45,524

00:26:59,519 --> 00:27:02,874
>> AND JESSICA HERE IS A NURSE.
HOW COOL IS THAT?

434
00:27:02,874 --> 00:27:05,322
SHE TAKES SUCH GOOD CARE OF ME.

435
00:27:05,789 --> 00:27:08,114
>> AND JUST LIKE OUR REGULAR DOLLS,

436
00:27:08,114 --> 00:27:11,915
OUR XL DOLLS HAVE
INCREDIBLE ATTENTION TO DETAIL.

437
00:27:11,915 --> 00:27:13,979
>> JUST LOOK AT THE STITCHING ON
MY DOLL'S SUIT.

438
00:27:13,979 --> 00:27:16,914
>> AND ALL THE COOL PATCHES ON
MY ASTRONAUT DOLL.

439
00:27:16,914 --> 00:27:19,737
>> AND MY DOLL'S FEET.
SO LIFELIKE.

440
00:27:19,737 --> 00:27:22,773
>> WHAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT ARE
THEIR STORIES.

441
00:27:22,773 --> 00:27:26,178
SUZANNE HERE WAS THE FIRST
FEMALE JUDGE IN MISSOURI.

442
00:27:26,178 --> 00:27:28,324
>> I MADE UP MY OWN BACKSTORY
FOR JESSICA.

443
00:27:28,324 --> 00:27:29,542
SHE'S FROM LITHUANIA.

444
00:27:29,542 --> 00:27:33,611
>> NO, SHE'S AMERICAN.
>> WELL, SHE IS NOW.

445
00:27:33,611 --> 00:27:36,659
>> MINE HATES HER DAD, AND SHE
WANTS TO BE A SINGER.

446
00:27:36,659 --> 00:27:39,299
THAT'S WHY HER MOUTH IS ALWAYS
OPEN.

447
00:27:39,847 --> 00:27:43,700
>> THE POINT IS, AMERICAN GIRL XL DOLLS

448
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:46,083
WILL INSPIRE WOMEN OF
ALL AGES.

449
00:27:46,083 --> 00:27:49,751
AND YOU CAN EVEN DESIGN YOUR OWN
BASED ON HISTORICAL FIGURES.

450
00:27:49,751 --> 00:27:52,088
>> MINE LOOKS LIKE ROSIE THE
RIVETER.

451
00:27:52,088 --> 00:27:54,474
>> MINE LOOKS LIKE AMELIA
EARHART.

452
00:27:54,474 --> 00:27:56,658
>> MINE LOOKS LIKE MY BROTHER'S
WIFE.

453
00:27:56,658 --> 00:27:59,999
>> NO, THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE
HISTORICAL FIGURES.

454
00:27:59,999 --> 00:28:03,102
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
ABIGAIL HERE IS FROM COLONIAL
TIMES.

455
00:28:03,102 --> 00:28:05,895
THAT'S WHY HER HANDS CHURN
BUTTER.

456
00:28:05,895 --> 00:28:09,314
>> ARE YOU HERE WITH SOMEBODY?
MAYBE YOUR DAUGHTER OR --

457
00:28:09,314 --> 00:28:11,244
>> CLOSE.
MY DAD.

458
00:28:11,244 --> 00:28:14,548
>> MINE'S AN OLYMPIC SKIER.

459
00:28:14,548 --> 00:28:16,120
>> I REALLY DON'T LIKE THAT.

460
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:18,331
>> AND THE BEST PART IS --
>> WAIT, WHO ARE YOU?

461
00:28:18,331 --> 00:28:21,464
>> YOU CAN TAKE THE CLOTHING
FROM YOUR REGULAR AMERICAN GIRL DOLL

462
00:28:21,464 --> 00:28:23,104
AND USE IT ON YOUR XL DOLL.

463
00:28:23,104 --> 00:28:25,419
>> PLEASE, NEVER DO THAT.
WHY WOULD YOU DO THIS TO HER?

464
00:28:25,419 --> 00:28:27,565
>> BECAUSE IT'S FUN AND WE'RE IN
LOVE.

465
00:28:27,565 --> 00:28:29,474
>> AND THEIR HAIR IS SUPER
STRONG.

466
00:28:29,474 --> 00:28:32,419
>> YOU CAN MIX AND MATCH THEIR
PARTS.
I MADE MINE BIRACIAL.

467
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:35,667
>> IF YOU FOLD HER IN HALF, SHE
FITS RIGHT INTO THE DISHWASHER.

468
00:28:35,667 --> 00:28:38,234
>> HEY, WANT TO TRADE FOR A
LITTLE WHILE?
>> I'D LOVE THAT.

469
00:28:38,234 --> 00:28:40,480
>> THAT'S IT, WE'RE SHUTTING THE
STORE DOWN.

470
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:42,402
>> AMERICAN GIRL XL.

471
00:28:42,402 --> 00:28:44,931
THEY MADE AN XL MISTAKE.

472
00:28:44,931 --> 00:28:47,557
>> HONEY, SLOW DOWN, THAT'S YOUR
THIRD MARTINI.

473
00:28:47,557 --> 00:28:50,715
HERE, HAVE SOME OF YOUR HOT DOG.

474
00:28:55,521 --> 00:28:58,503
>>> ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT,

475
00:28:58,503 --> 00:29:01,958
LET'S HEAR IT ONE MORE TIME FOR
ALEXIS!

476
00:29:03,962 --> 00:29:07,702
>> OH, MY GOD, THAT WAS SO
CRAZY.

477
00:29:07,702 --> 00:29:11,865
>> WHAT'S CRAZY IS THAT I'M
GETTING MARRIED IN TWO WEEKS.

478
00:29:12,182 --> 00:29:14,733
>> I WISH IT WAS TO ME.

479
00:29:14,733 --> 00:29:17,344
OOPS, I SAID THAT OUT LOUD.

480
00:29:17,344 --> 00:29:18,824
I'LL BE LEAVING NOW.

481
00:29:18,824 --> 00:29:21,102
>> OKAY.
BYE!

482
00:29:21,102 --> 00:29:23,013
YOU GUYS, THIS IS SO MUCH FUN.

483
00:29:23,013 --> 00:29:25,712
WAIT -- WHERE ARE KAYLA AND
DELULAH?

484
00:29:25,712 --> 00:29:28,209
>> OH, MY GOD, THEY'RE ON THE
BULL.

485
00:29:28,209 --> 00:29:30,081
>> HI, GIRLIES!

486
00:29:30,081 --> 00:29:31,971
>> YEE-HAW, YOU GUYS!

487
00:29:31,971 --> 00:29:36,294
>> ONE AT A TIME, PLEASE, AND
YOU'RE MUCH TOO DRUNK.

488
00:29:36,294 --> 00:29:39,849
>> NO, WE'RE NOT.
I ONLY HAD A MARTINI WITH A
TWIST.

489
00:29:39,849 --> 00:29:43,296
AND THE TWIST, I HAD FOUR
MARGARITAS.

490
00:29:43,296 --> 00:29:46,727
>> LET'S GET THIS DONKEY MOVING,
Y'ALL!
>> YEAH!

491
00:29:46,727 --> 00:29:48,735
>> IT IS NOT A DONKEY.

492
00:29:48,735 --> 00:29:51,555
ANDRE, DO NOT START THAT BULL.

493
00:29:55,395 --> 00:29:58,812
ON THE ONE HAND, I KNOW I'M NOT
SUPPOSED TO DO THIS.

494
00:29:58,812 --> 00:30:01,765
BUT ON THE OTHER HAND -- I WOULD
LIKE TO SEE

495
00:30:01,765 --> 00:30:04,828
TWO BUXOM BABES
BEING BUCKED AROUND ON A BRONCO.

496
00:30:04,828 --> 00:30:08,196
I CALL THIS "ANDRE'S DILEMMA."

497
00:30:08,283 --> 00:30:11,436
DILEMMA SOLVED.
I WILL DO IT.

498
00:30:16,539 --> 00:30:19,597
>> ANDRE!
WHAT SETTING DID YOU PUT IT ON?

499
00:30:19,597 --> 00:30:23,078
>> OH MY DEAR GOODNESS ME, I AM
AFRAID IN MY TITILLATED STATE

500
00:30:23,078 --> 00:30:26,186
I
ACCIDENTALLY SET IT TO "BON
VOYAGE."

LION WANDERING IN THE WOODS --

749
00:44:09,230 --> 00:44:09,962
ACTUALLY JUST A DOG WITH A NEW

750
00:44:09,964 --> 00:44:10,296
HAIRCUT.

751
00:44:13,535 --> 00:44:14,267
IRELAND, I GUESS WE ARE PRETTY

752
00:44:14,269 --> 00:44:14,567
DRUNK.

753
00:44:19,708 --> 00:44:20,940
>>> "THE NEW YORK TIMES"

754
00:44:20,942 --> 00:44:22,108
RECENTLY RAN AN ARTICLE CALLING

755
00:44:22,110 --> 00:44:25,478
THE STATEN ISLAND FERRY THAT I

756
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:26,245
PURCHASED WITH PETE DAVIDSON --

757
00:44:28,917 --> 00:44:31,417
CALLED IT A MONEY-LOSING FIASCO.

758
00:44:31,820 --> 00:44:32,652
WITH MORE ON THIS, PETE

759
00:44:32,654 --> 00:44:34,220
DAVIDSON.

760
00:44:35,757 --> 00:44:41,661
>> WHAT'S UP?

761
00:44:41,663 --> 00:44:42,428
THANK YOU.

762
00:44:42,430 --> 00:44:44,931
ALL RIGHT.

763
00:44:44,933 --> 00:44:45,364
>> WELCOME.

764
00:44:45,366 --> 00:44:45,832
>> THANK YOU.

765
00:44:45,834 --> 00:44:46,833
>> WELCOME BACK.

766
00:44:46,835 --> 00:44:48,668
>> THANK YOU, COLIN.

767
00:44:48,670 --> 00:44:50,303
COLIN, YOU'RE LOOKING GREAT AS

768
00:44:50,305 --> 00:44:50,603
EVER.

769
00:44:50,605 --> 00:44:51,204
CHE, STARTING TO CRACK.

770
00:44:51,206 --> 00:44:51,537
>> WHOA!

771
00:44:55,410 --> 00:44:56,242
>> SORRY.

772
00:44:56,244 --> 00:44:57,577
SO YEAH, IN CASE YOU'RE

773
00:44:57,579 --> 00:44:59,312
WONDERING WHY I HAD TO DO A SHOW

774
00:44:59,314 --> 00:45:01,848
IN SAUDI ARABIA, WE'RE LOSING

775
00:45:01,850 --> 00:45:02,448
MILLIONS ON THIS FERRY.

776
00:45:04,385 --> 00:45:06,385
I ASSUME THAT'S WHAT THE ARTICLE

777
00:45:06,387 --> 00:45:06,686
SAYS.

778
00:45:06,688 --> 00:45:08,020
I CAN'T SPEND $5 ON A PAYWALL

779
00:45:08,022 --> 00:45:09,489
WHEN I GOT A KID ON THE WAY.

780
00:45:09,491 --> 00:45:11,457
>> OH, THAT'S RIGHT, CONGRATS,

781
00:45:11,459 --> 00:45:11,758
PETE.

782
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:12,158
>> YES, YES.

783
00:45:12,827 --> 00:45:15,595
THANK YOU, YEAH.

784
00:45:15,597 --> 00:45:17,163
I'M JUST -- I'M JUST EXCITED TO

785
00:45:17,165 --> 00:45:18,798
BE A DAD, YOU KNOW, AND GIVE IT

786
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:20,466
ALL THE ENERGY AND ENTHUSIASM I

787
00:45:20,468 --> 00:45:21,067
NEVER HAD FOR THIS SHOW.

788
00:45:24,672 --> 00:45:25,705
>> COME ON.

789
00:45:25,707 --> 00:45:27,473
I WILL TELL YOU ON THE OTHER

790
00:45:27,475 --> 00:45:29,008
SIDE, I DEFINITELY PREFER HAVING

791
00:45:29,010 --> 00:45:30,676
A KID TO A FERRY.

792
00:45:30,678 --> 00:45:32,545
>> WHAT ARE YOU REALLY WORRIED

793
00:45:32,547 --> 00:45:32,845
ABOUT?

794
00:45:32,847 --> 00:45:34,814
YOU HAVE A GREAT JOB AND YOUR

795
00:45:34,816 --> 00:45:36,516
UNCLE ROBERT IS THE HHS

796
00:45:36,518 --> 00:45:38,351
SECRETARY, RIGHT?

797
00:45:38,753 --> 00:45:40,086
>> FOR THE LAST TIME, PETE, I'M

798
00:45:40,088 --> 00:45:40,553
NOT A KENNEDY.

799
00:45:40,555 --> 00:45:40,887
>> OKAY.

800
00:45:42,924 --> 00:45:44,891
LOOK, I ACTUALLY -- I UNDERSTAND

801
00:45:44,893 --> 00:45:45,158
RFK.

802
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:46,659
I WOULDN'T BE FAMOUS WITHOUT MY

803
00:45:46,661 --> 00:45:48,928
DAD DYING, EITHER.

804
00:45:51,132 --> 00:45:51,731
THANK GOD THAT HAPPENED.

805
00:45:51,733 --> 00:45:53,900
WOULDN'T TRADE IT.

806
00:45:53,902 --> 00:45:54,333
>> GOOD LORD.

807
00:45:54,335 --> 00:45:54,634
>> NO?

808
00:45:54,636 --> 00:45:56,936
ALL RIGHT.

809
00:45:56,938 --> 00:45:59,438
WE EVEN GAVE THE BOAT A NEW

810
00:45:59,440 --> 00:45:59,739
NAME.

811
00:45:59,741 --> 00:46:01,808
WE THOUGHT "THE STATEN ISLAND

812
00:46:01,810 --> 00:46:03,376
FERRY" SOUNDED TOO DEPRESSING.

813
00:46:03,378 --> 00:46:06,612
NOW IT'S CALLED "THE TITANIC 2."

814
00:46:07,015 --> 00:46:07,914
>> IT'S GOING VERY WELL.

815
00:46:07,916 --> 00:46:10,049
WE GOT PAID BY NIKE TO PUT AN AD

816
00:46:10,051 --> 00:46:11,417
ON IT FOR THE NEW YORK CITY

817
00:46:11,419 --> 00:46:11,784
MARATHON.

818
00:46:11,786 --> 00:46:12,218
>> EXACTLY.

819
00:46:12,220 --> 00:46:14,453
IF LORNE MICHAELS HAS CAUGHT US

820
00:46:14,455 --> 00:46:15,822
ANYTHING, IT'S THAT YOU NEVER,

821
00:46:15,824 --> 00:46:17,690
EVER GIVE UP.

822
00:46:17,692 --> 00:46:18,758
EVEN IF EVERYONE SAYS THE TIME

823
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:21,160
HAS COME AND TINA FEY IS READY

824
00:46:21,162 --> 00:46:23,029
TO TAKE OVER.

825
00:46:29,103 --> 00:46:30,403
NO, I ACTUALLY HAVE A GREAT IDEA

826
00:46:30,405 --> 00:46:31,971
TO MAKE THIS FERRY MORE OF A

827
00:46:31,973 --> 00:46:32,338
SUCCESS.

828
00:46:32,340 --> 00:46:32,805
>> OH, GREAT.

829
00:46:32,807 --> 00:46:35,808
>> AS YOU KNOW, WE JUST HAD A

830
00:46:35,810 --> 00:46:37,143
MAYORAL ELECTION, WHICH IS MY

831
00:46:37,145 --> 00:46:37,810
LEAST FAVORITE KIND OF ORAL.

832
00:46:41,616 --> 00:46:45,651
THAT'S A CLASSIC PETE!

833
00:46:46,054 --> 00:46:49,989
PETE'S BACK, BABY!

834
00:46:49,991 --> 00:46:53,192
>> YOU'RE ADDING NEW BITS NOW?

835
00:46:53,194 --> 00:46:54,327
YOU'VE BEEN GONE FOR YEARS.

836
00:46:54,329 --> 00:46:55,094
>> YEP, IT'S NOW THIS AND CHAD.

837
00:46:55,096 --> 00:46:55,761
>> YEAH.

838
00:47:00,902 --> 00:47:03,069
>> SO ANYWAY, WE JUST HAD AN

839
00:47:03,071 --> 00:47:03,436
ELECTION.

840
00:47:03,438 --> 00:47:04,904
IF YOU DON'T MIND, I HAVE A

841
00:47:04,906 --> 00:47:06,272
MESSAGE FOR EVERYONE WHO DID NOT

842
00:47:06,274 --> 00:47:08,307
VOTE FOR OUR NEW MAYOR.

843
00:47:08,309 --> 00:47:10,776
HEY, STATEN ISLANDERS!

844
00:47:11,179 --> 00:47:12,879
DID YOU PROMISE TO MOVE OUT OF

845
00:47:12,881 --> 00:47:14,847
NEW YORK IF MAMDANI WON BUT HAVE

846
00:47:14,849 --> 00:47:16,282
TOO MANY WARRANTS IN NEW JERSEY

847
00:47:16,284 --> 00:47:18,417
AND NOT ENOUGH GUNS FOR FLORIDA?

848
00:47:18,820 --> 00:47:19,518
WELCOME TO NEW STATEN ISLAND!

849
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:22,088
YEAH!

850
00:47:22,090 --> 00:47:23,089
IT WILL HAVE EVERYTHING THAT

851
00:47:23,091 --> 00:47:23,756
MAKES STATEN ISLAND GREAT.

852
00:47:23,758 --> 00:47:24,590
THE PIZZA.

853
00:47:29,063 --> 00:47:29,729
>> THAT WAS THE WHOLE LIST?

854
00:47:29,731 --> 00:47:31,797
>> YEP.

855
00:47:31,799 --> 00:47:32,999
NEW STATEN ISLAND.

856
00:47:33,001 --> 00:47:34,867
WE CAN'T CALL IT THE TITANIC

857
00:47:34,869 --> 00:47:36,269
ANYMORE SINCE THE PEOPLE ON THIS

858
00:47:36,271 --> 00:47:37,036
SHIP WILL ACTUALLY LOVE RUNNING

859
00:47:37,038 --> 00:47:40,039
INTO ICE.

860
00:47:42,010 --> 00:47:42,575
THAT WAS PRETTY GOOD.

861
00:47:42,577 --> 00:47:43,643
GOT IT GOING, YEP.

862
00:47:43,645 --> 00:47:44,610
STILL GOT IT.

863
00:47:44,612 --> 00:47:46,045
>> I JUST FEEL LIKE IT'S GOING

864
00:47:46,047 --> 00:47:47,246
TO BE A BIG YEAR FOR US.

865
00:47:47,248 --> 00:47:48,381
>> I THINK SO TOO, I COULDN'T BE

866
00:47:48,383 --> 00:47:49,048
MORE EXCITED.

867
00:47:49,050 --> 00:47:50,950
MY POINT IS, LOOK, THE FERRY,

868
00:47:50,952 --> 00:47:52,785
IT'S FINE.

869
00:47:52,787 --> 00:47:53,653
SOMETIMES THE NEWS JUST MAKES

870
00:47:53,655 --> 00:47:55,187
THINGS SEEM WORSE THAN THEY ARE.

871
00:47:55,189 --> 00:47:56,322
LIKE HOW EVERYONE WAS SURE

872
00:47:56,324 --> 00:47:57,623
CERTAIN PEOPLE WOULD BE EXPOSED

873
00:47:57,625 --> 00:48:00,126
AND RUINED FOR PEOPLE ON THE

874
00:48:00,128 --> 00:48:01,193
EPSTEIN LIST.

875
00:48:01,195 --> 00:48:03,195
IT'S 2025 AND ALL THREE OF US

876
00:48:03,197 --> 00:48:05,164
ARE STILL UP HERE.

877
00:48:05,566 --> 00:48:07,400
>> PETE DAVIDSON, EVERYONE.

00:48:07,402 --> 00:48:09,802
FOR "WEEKEND UPDATE," I'M COLIN

00:48:09,804 --> 00:48:10,102
JOST.

880
00:48:10,104 --> 00:48:10,436
>> I'M MICHA

ALL RIGHT, GUYS.

NEXT ACTION ITEM.

888
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:54,413
THIS IS PRETTY SERIOUS, OKAY?

889
00:48:54,415 --> 00:48:56,415
I GOT AN EMAIL FROM THE GREEK

890
00:48:56,417 --> 00:48:58,084
LIFE ADVISER, AND APPARENTLY

891
00:48:58,086 --> 00:48:59,919
ANOTHER SORORITY JUST LEARNED

892
00:48:59,921 --> 00:49:01,754
ONE OF THEIR PLEDGES WAS

893
00:49:01,756 --> 00:49:04,390
ACTUALLY A FRAT GUY IN A

894
00:49:04,392 --> 00:49:05,958
HYPER-REALISTIC GIRL MASK.

895
00:49:05,960 --> 00:49:06,525
>> NO WAY.

896
00:49:06,527 --> 00:49:07,159
>> WHAT?

897
00:49:07,161 --> 00:49:07,827
>> WHAT?

898
00:49:07,829 --> 00:49:08,561
>> OH, MY GOD, THAT'S SO WEIRD.

899
00:49:10,131 --> 00:49:12,698
>> YEAH, THAT IS SO WEIRD!

900
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:14,300
>> I KNOW.

901
00:49:14,302 --> 00:49:16,569
WELL, THEY ASKED US TO JUST STAY

902
00:49:16,571 --> 00:49:17,203
VIGILANT, OKAY?

903
00:49:17,205 --> 00:49:18,637
I'M JUST ASKING YOU, IF YOU SEE

904
00:49:18,639 --> 00:49:19,338
ANYTHING, JUST SAY SOMETHING,

905
00:49:19,340 --> 00:49:21,707
OKAY?

906
00:49:21,709 --> 00:49:23,876
>> UM, SO I DON'T WANT TO, LIKE,

907
00:49:23,878 --> 00:49:25,277
CALL SOMEONE OUT OR WHATEVER.

908
00:49:25,279 --> 00:49:27,513
BUT I THINK SOMEONE IN OUR

909
00:49:27,515 --> 00:49:30,483
SORORITY HEAT BE A FRAT GUY IN A

>> ARE YOU CRAZY?

918
00:49:41,095 --> 00:49:42,762
>> SO MEAN.

919
00:49:42,764 --> 00:49:44,029
>> SHAME ON YOU, MADDIE.

920
00:49:44,031 --> 00:49:45,064
>> THAT'S MESSED UP.

921
00:49:45,066 --> 00:49:45,431
>> YEAH.

922
00:49:45,433 --> 00:49:46,499
>> WHAT THE HELL, MADDIE?

923
00:49:46,501 --> 00:49:47,166
HAVE SOME RESPECT FOR YOUR

924
00:49:47,168 --> 00:49:49,969
SISTER.

925
00:49:49,971 --> 00:49:51,370
>> SORRY.

926
00:49:51,372 --> 00:49:52,905
YOU SAID SAY SOMETHING IF YOU

927
00:49:52,907 --> 00:49:53,606
SAW SOMETHING STRANGE.

928
00:49:53,608 --> 00:49:55,040
>> JUST SAY IT, MADDIE.

929
00:49:55,042 --> 00:50:00,713
YOU THINK ALYSSA'S UGLY.

930
00:50:00,715 --> 00:50:02,782
HOW TO THE ABSOLUTE DARE YOU!

931
00:50:02,784 --> 00:50:03,983
DELTA GAMMAS DON'T JUDGE

932
00:50:03,985 --> 00:50:05,217
PEOPLE'S LOOKS.

933
00:50:05,219 --> 00:50:07,787
DID YOU FORGET OUR MOTTO?

934
00:50:07,789 --> 00:50:09,555
DON'T JUDGE PEOPLE'S LOOKS.

935
00:50:09,957 --> 00:50:11,357
WE JUDGE PEOPLE BY HOW MUCH

936
00:50:11,359 --> 00:50:12,358
MONEY THEIR PARENTS MAKE.

937
00:50:12,360 --> 00:50:13,893
>> OKAY, YEAH.

938
00:50:13,895 --> 00:50:15,795
THIS ISN'T ABOUT ALYSSA, MADDIE,

939
00:50:15,797 --> 00:50:16,862
IT'S ABOUT YOU.

940
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:22,067
YOU ALWAYS GET ON NEW SISTERS.

941
00:50:22,069 --> 00:50:24,136
YOU WERE AWFUL TO ME LAST YEAR,

942
00:50:24,138 --> 00:50:25,738
NOW YOU'RE ACCUSING HER OF BEING

943
00:50:25,740 --> 00:50:27,239
A FRAT GUY IN A MASK?

944
00:50:27,241 --> 00:50:28,007
THAT'S DISGUSTING.

945
00:50:28,009 --> 00:50:28,974
>> DISGUSTING!

946
00:50:28,976 --> 00:50:30,009
>> OKAY, DO YOU SEE HOW SHE

947
00:50:30,011 --> 00:50:30,309
EATS?

948
00:50:30,311 --> 00:50:31,277
THAT IS NOT NORMAL.

949
00:50:31,279 --> 00:50:33,846
>> WHAT?

950
00:50:33,848 --> 00:50:35,181
>> YOU'RE JUST JEALOUS OF WHAT

951
00:50:35,183 --> 00:50:38,284
AN AMAZING PERSON ALYSSA IS.

952
00:50:38,286 --> 00:50:39,952
HER CONTRIBUTION TO DELTA GAMMA

953
00:50:39,954 --> 00:50:41,253
IS UNMATCHED.

954
00:50:41,255 --> 00:50:42,488
SHE'S JUST A FIRST YEAR AND

955
00:50:42,490 --> 00:50:43,989
SHE'S ALREADY PLANNED NOT ONE,

956
00:50:43,991 --> 00:50:47,326
NOT TWO, BUT 15 BIKINI CAR WASH

957
00:50:47,328 --> 00:50:47,760
FUND-RAISERS.

958
00:50:48,162 --> 00:50:50,963
>> YEAH, GIRL POWER!

959
00:50:50,965 --> 00:50:51,997
>> DON'T YOU THINK IT'S

960
00:50:51,999 --> 00:50:53,466
SUSPICIOUS THAT SHE NEVER

961
00:50:53,468 --> 00:50:53,899
PARTICIPATES?

962
00:50:53,901 --> 00:50:56,235
>> SHE'S ALLERGIC TO THE SUN.

963
00:50:56,237 --> 00:50:58,070
IT'S JUST SAFER FOR HER TO WATCH

964
00:50:58,072 --> 00:51:00,105
FROM THE GARAGE, WEARING

965
00:51:00,107 --> 00:51:00,773
SUNGLASSES, WITH A PILE OF

966
00:51:00,775 --> 00:51:05,611
TOWELS ON HER LAP.

967
00:51:05,613 --> 00:51:06,278
I'M SORRY, MADDIE, BUT YOUR

968
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:07,580
THEORY IS REJECTED DUE TO LACK

969
00:51:07,582 --> 00:51:08,047
OF PROOF.

970
00:51:08,049 --> 00:51:08,747
>> CAN MY PROOF BE HER VAPING

971
00:51:08,749 --> 00:51:11,283
RIGHT NOW?

972
00:51:11,285 --> 00:51:12,151
THE SMOKE IS COMING OUT OF HER

973
00:51:12,153 --> 00:51:14,587
EYEHOLES.

974
00:51:14,589 --> 00:51:17,289
HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN THIS?

975
00:51:17,291 --> 00:51:20,459
>> IT JUST DOES THAT!

976
00:51:20,461 --> 00:51:21,827
>> MADDIE, STOP.

977
00:51:21,829 --> 00:51:23,262
YOU'RE MAKING ALYSSA SAD.

978
00:51:23,264 --> 00:51:27,166
LOOK.

979
00:51:32,039 --> 00:51:40,546
>> SO SAD.

980
00:51:40,548 --> 00:51:42,348
>> MAYBE I SHOULD JUST GO.

981
00:51:42,350 --> 00:51:42,648
>> NO!

982
00:51:42,650 --> 00:51:45,050
>> DON'T GO!

983
00:51:45,052 --> 00:51:47,019
>> CAN WE JUST TAKE A MOMENT AND

984
00:51:47,021 --> 00:51:50,222
LOOK AT WHAT'S INSIDE HER PURSE?

985
00:51:50,224 --> 00:51:52,858
A HUGE UNOPENED BOX OF MAXI

986
00:51:52,860 --> 00:51:53,158
PADS.

987
00:51:53,160 --> 00:51:53,993
>> WHAT?

988
00:51:53,995 --> 00:51:55,060
>> A BEANIE BABY.

989
00:51:55,062 --> 00:51:55,794
>> WHAT?

990
00:51:55,796 --> 00:51:56,529
>> AND A FRAMED PHOTO OF HILLARY

991
00:51:56,531 --> 00:51:56,862
CLINTON.

992
00:51:59,967 --> 00:52:00,833
>> AND?

993
00:52:00,835 --> 00:52:03,068
>> AND THAT LOOKS LIKE A STUPID

994
00:52:03,070 --> 00:52:04,670
GUY WOULD THINK GIRLS HAVE IN

995
00:52:04,672 --> 00:52:05,104
THEIR PURSE.

996
00:52:05,106 --> 00:52:07,573
>> I'MA SLAP THIS BITCH.

997
00:52:07,575 --> 00:52:08,674
>> CALM DOWN, JESUS.

998
00:52:08,676 --> 00:52:09,542
THIS DISCUSSION IS OVER.

999
00:52:09,544 --> 00:52:09,909
ALL RIGHT?

1000
00:52:09,911 --> 00:52:13,312
MEETING ADJOURNED.

1001
00:52:13,314 --> 00:52:14,280
>> GIVE ME MY PURSE.

1002
00:52:14,282 --> 00:52:15,014
>> OKAY.

1003
00:52:15,016 --> 00:52:17,149
>> I'M SO SORRY FOR ALL OF THIS,

1004
00:52:17,151 --> 00:52:17,483
ALYSSA.

1005
00:52:17,485 --> 00:52:20,853
>> IT'S OKAY.

1006
00:52:20,855 --> 00:52:24,189
BYE!

1007
00:52:24,191 --> 00:52:24,590
OH, MY GOD.

1008
00:52:24,592 --> 00:52:25,291
I'M GOING TO PASS OUT IN THIS

1009
00:52:25,293 --> 00:52:26,325
THING.

1010
00:52:26,327 --> 00:52:29,094
>> ALYSSA?

1011
00:52:29,096 --> 00:52:31,196
>> UH -- I CAN EXPLAIN.

1012
00:52:31,198 --> 00:52:35,467
>> NO NEED.

1013
00:52:35,469 --> 00:52:37,970
SECRET'S SAFE WITH ME, MAN.

1014
00:52:45,779 --> 00:52:59,391
BRAD.

1015
00:52:59,393 --> 00:53:00,125
DON'T SIT IN YOUR ROOM, PLAY

1016
00:53:00,127 --> 00:53:01,560
VIDEO GAMES ALL WEEKEND.

1017

ALL RIGHT?

1018
00:53:02,029 --> 00:53:02,761
COME ON, LET'S GO OUTSIDE.

1019
00:53:02,763 --> 00:53:05,030
>> OKAY.

1020
00:53:05,032 --> 00:53:06,498
>> I'M SERIOUS, BUD, COME ON.

1021
00:53:06,500 --> 00:53:07,499
SAY GOOD-BYE TO YOUR FRIENDS.

1022
00:53:07,501 --> 00:53:08,267
>> OKAY, I JUST LITERALLY NEED

1023
00:53:08,269 --> 00:53:09,001
ONE SECOND.

1024
00:53:09,003 --> 00:53:13,005
>> ONE.

1025
00:53:13,007 --> 00:53:13,772
>> ANYONE HAVE A SHIELD JACK?

1026
00:53:13,774 --> 00:53:14,773

BRAD'S GOT TO GO.

1029
00:53:17,278 --> 00:53:18,544
HEY!

1030
00:53:18,546 --> 00:53:19,244
FIRST OF ALL, YOU NEVER CALL

1031
00:53:19,246 --> 00:53:20,779
SOMEONE THAT WORD.

1032
00:53:20,781 --> 00:53:22,247
SECOND OF ALL, IT MAKES NO SENSE

1033
00:53:22,249 --> 00:53:24,249
'CAUSE I'M WHITE.

1034
00:53:24,251 --> 00:53:25,751
LITTLE JACKASS.

1035
00:53:25,753 --> 00:53:26,752

>> WHY DO I KEEP GETTING THIS

1039
00:53:33,227 --> 00:53:34,760
STUFF?

1040
00:53:34,762 --> 00:53:35,527
>> DAD, I'M TOO OLD FOR THE

PLAYGROUND.

1042
00:53:37,264 --> 00:53:38,497
>> NO, YOU'RE NOT, YOU'RE 10.

1043
00:53:38,499 --> 00:53:41,000
>> I'M 11, THOUGH.

1044
00:53:41,002 --> 00:53:42,501

BUT COME ON, GO DOWN THE SLIDE.

1046

00:55:20,768 --> 00:55:21,500
DON'T TELL HER I SAID THAT, BUT

1090
00:55:21,502 --> 00:55:22,000
IT'S TRUE.

1091
00:55:22,002 --> 00:55:22,768
OKAY?

1092
00:55:22,770 --> 00:55:26,004

1099
00:56:06,163 --> 00:56:07,496
>> LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WE DO

1100

APOLOGIZE FOR THE DELAY.

1101
00:56:11,068 --> 00:56:12,334
AS YOU KNOW, THE GOVERNMENT

1102
00:56:12,336 --> 00:56:13,502
SHUTDOWN HAS AFFECTED THE

1103
00:56:13,504 --> 00:56:15,370
FLIGHTS AROUND THE COUNTRY.

1104
00:56:15,372 --> 00:56:19,241
I'M NOT BLAMING ANYONE, MAMDANI,

1105
00:56:19,243 --> 00:56:20,809
BUT WE'RE DOING OUR BEST TO MOVE

1107
00:56:23,614 --> 00:56:24,980
WE DO APOLOGIZE, AND THANK YOU.

00:56:38,696 --> 00:56:40,395
GOOD NEWS IS, FINE WEATHER

1119
00:56:40,397 --> 00:56:41,230
COMING OUT OF CLEVELAND.

1120
00:56:41,232 --> 00:56:42,731
SHOULD BE A SMOOTH FLIGHT ONCE

1121
00:56:42,733 --> 00:56:44,199
WE GET UP IN THE AIR.

1122

GOING TO BE MEETING UP WITH A

1127
00:56:50,374 --> 00:56:52,207
YOUNG LADY OUT THERE.

1128
00:56:52,209 --> 00:56:53,909
I MET HER ON THE APPS.

1129
00:56:53,911 --> 00:56:55,310
ALWAYS SAID I WOULDN'T DO THE

1130
00:56:55,312 --> 00:56:57,045

1136
00:57:04,288 --> 00:57:05,687
GOING TO BE SWIMMING IN IT.

ATTAINABLE.

1143
00:57:18,035 --> 00:57:21,470
JUST SENT HER A RISKY TEXT.

1154
00:57:37,121 --> 00:57:41,223
SHE'S TOTALLY LEADING HIM ON.

00:57:41,225 --> 00:57:42,524
HOPPING IN THE SHOWER!

1156

TOWER SAYS HE'S ON TOP OF IT.

1165
00:57:58,309 --> 00:58:00,242
BAD NEWS IS, BY IT, I MEAN THE

1166
00:58:00,244 --> 00:58:01,109
TOWER ITSELF.

1167

1168
00:58:02,179 --> 00:58:02,945

00:58:14,058 --> 00:58:14,323
BAD.
