1
00:00:02,414 --> 00:00:04,106
EARLIER

2
00:00:11,447 --> 00:00:15,704
>>> HELLO.
I'D LIKE TO THANK PRESIDENT
TRUMP FOR HAVING US.

3
00:00:15,704 --> 00:00:20,625
THOSE OF US FROM THE
PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY
ARE
HONORED TO BE HERE TODAY

4
00:00:20,625 --> 00:00:25,384
ALONGSIDE RFK JR. AND DR. OZ.

5
00:00:25,384 --> 00:00:30,112
WE'RE GOING TO DISCUSS LOWERING
THE PRICE OF WEIGHT LOSS DRUGS.

6
00:00:30,112 --> 00:00:32,781
FOR YEARS, MY COMPANY, ELI LILLY,

7
00:00:32,781 --> 00:00:37,792
HAS BEEN AT THE FOREFRONT
OF PROVIDING AMERICANS WITH --

8
00:00:37,792 --> 00:00:40,541
>> OH, NO!

9
00:00:43,461 --> 00:00:46,356
>> OH, HI.
DIDN'T SEE YOU THERE.

10
00:00:46,356 --> 00:00:48,683
SOMEONE WAS DYING IN MY OFFICE.

11
00:00:48,683 --> 00:00:50,757
I THINK I'M PLAYING THIS VERY
NORMAL.

12
00:00:50,757 --> 00:00:54,507
JUST STAND THERE AND STARE LIKE
A SOCIOPATH.

13
00:00:54,507 --> 00:00:56,524
PRETEND LIKE I WAS GOING TO HELP,

14
00:00:56,524 --> 00:00:59,710
SOMEONE DROPS SOMETHING
AND YOU DO THE FAKE BEND, OH,

15
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:03,768
LET ME HELP YOU PICK THAT UP,
YOU GOT IT

16
00:01:03,768 --> 00:01:09,024
RFK OUT OF HERE LIKE
SOMEONE WAS TRYING TO GIVE HIM A
VACCINE.

17
00:01:09,024 --> 00:01:11,290
BRAINWORM, TAKE THE WHEEL!

18
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:14,576
THAT THING RATATOUILLE'D HIM OUT
OF THE ROOM.

19
00:01:14,576 --> 00:01:18,263
EACH WEEK, I LIKE TO CREATE A
BIG VISUAL

20
00:01:18,263 --> 00:01:20,321
THAT SUMS UP HOW
THINGS ARE GOING.

21
00:01:20,321 --> 00:01:23,157
LAST WEEK IT WAS THE DEMOLISHING
OF THE EAST WING.

22
00:01:23,157 --> 00:01:27,108
THIS WEEK IT'S A MEDICAL
PROFESSIONAL ALMOST DYING IN MY OVAL OFFICE

23
00:01:27,108 --> 00:01:29,908
AT THE MERE THOUGHT
OF CHARGING LESS FOR DRUGS.

24
00:01:29,908 --> 00:01:33,097
MAYBE NEXT WEEK A BALD EAGLE
WILL FALL DEAD OUT OF THE SKY

25
00:01:33,097 --> 00:01:35,328
AND SPLAT RIGHT ON THE WHITE
HOUSE LAWN.

26
00:01:35,328 --> 00:01:39,550
BY LAWN I MEAN BIG OUTDOOR
CONCRETE FLOOR.

27
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:41,415
THERE?

28
00:01:41,415 --> 00:01:44,005
MORE IMPORTANTLY, HOW'S THE
FLOOR?
OKAY?

29
00:01:44,005 --> 00:01:48,810
A GUY COLLAPSING IN THE OVAL
OFFICE, WHO'D HAVE THOUGHT IT
WOULD BE NOT ME.

30
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:53,198
DON'T WORRY, HE'LL BE FINE.
DR. OZ IS ON THE CASE.

31
00:01:53,198 --> 00:01:57,016
ANYWAY, ALL IN ALL A GREAT,
AWESOME WEEK

32
00:01:57,016 --> 00:02:00,149
EXCEPT FOR
ELECTION.
THE DEMOCRATS WON.

33
00:02:00,149 --> 00:02:04,809
THE LAMESTREAM MEDIA CALLED THE
ELECTIONS A REBUKE OF TRUMP'S
POLICIES.

34
00:02:04,809 --> 00:02:08,868
JOKE'S ON THEM, THEY'RE STEPHEN
MILLER'S POLICIES, I DON'T READ
THAT STUFF.

35
00:02:08,868 --> 00:02:11,505
NO LIKEE READEE.

36
00:02:11,505 --> 00:02:14,216
CAN'T BELIEVE THEY ELECTED
MAMDANI.

37
00:02:14,216 --> 00:02:16,105
WE LIKE TO SAY, MAMDANI.

38
00:02:16,105 --> 00:02:20,221
I'M TORN BECAUSE I LIKE A WINNER
BUT I'M NOT CRAZY ABOUT A
MUSLIM.

39
00:02:20,221 --> 00:02:22,439
MAYBE HE'LL CONVERT.

40
00:02:22,439 --> 00:02:27,256
WE'LL PUT HIM IN LINE BEHIND
URSHA VANCE, AND I HOPE I'M
PRONOUNCING THAT WRONG.

41
00:02:27,256 --> 00:02:29,794
OUR SIDE HAD SOME WINS THIS
WEEK, TOO.

42
00:02:29,794 --> 00:02:32,788
THE SUPREME COURT SAID WE COULD
STOP FEEDING POOR PEOPLE.

43
00:02:32,788 --> 00:02:36,555
YOU CAN CLAP FOR THAT.
S.N.A.P.!

44
00:02:36,555 --> 00:02:38,302
S.N.A.P.!

45
00:02:38,302 --> 00:02:42,342
FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO CAN AFFORD
FOOD, NO, YOU CAN'T.

46
00:02:42,342 --> 00:02:45,099
I PROMISED GROCERY PRICES WOULD
PLUMMET,

47
00:02:45,099 --> 00:02:47,459
AND THEY DID, THEY
PLUMMETED STRAIGHT UP.

48
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:53,040
PEOPLE ARE SAYING, BUT SIR, HOW
WILL I AFFORD MY THANKSGIVING
TURKEY FOR MY FAMILY?

49
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:57,072
WELL, GOOD NEWS IS YOUR FAMILY'S
NOT COMING BECAUSE ALL THE
PLANES ARE GONE.

50
00:02:57,072 --> 00:03:00,287
WE CALL THAT PROBLEM SOLVING
PROBLEM.

51
00:03:00,287 --> 00:03:05,137
KILLING TWO BIRDS WITH ANOTHER
BIRD.
NOW YOU GOT A BUNCH OF CRAZY
BIRDS.

52
00:03:05,137 --> 00:03:07,835
WE LIKE IT, WE LIKE IT, THAT'S
KIND OF OUR THING.

53
00:03:07,835 --> 00:03:10,137
CAN'T AFFORD FOOD, HAVE SOME
CHEAP OZEMPIC.

54
00:03:10,137 --> 00:03:14,583
NOW YOU'RE NOT HUNGRY AND YOU
GET TO TAKE ONE WEIRD, PAINFUL
POOP A WEEK.

55
00:03:14,583 --> 00:03:17,094
HOW'S IT GOING BACK THERE?
IS HE DEAD?

56
00:03:17,094 --> 00:03:22,322
THEY'RE DOING THE -- THEY GOT
THE LEGS UP, THAT MEANS DEAD IN
CARTOON.

57
00:03:22,322 --> 00:03:25,353
ACTUALLY, DON'T TELL ME IF HE'S
DEAD, I WANT TO BE SURPRISED.

58
00:03:25,353 --> 00:03:27,975
ANYWAY.
GOVERNMENT IS STILL SHUT DOWN.

59
00:03:27,975 --> 00:03:30,763
ALL THANKS TO THE DEMOCRATS AND
SOME REPUBLICANS

60
00:03:30,763 --> 00:03:32,923
AND ALL
REPUBLICANS AND ME.

61
00:03:32,923 --> 00:03:37,406
PEOPLE SAY, JUST CAVE, DON, GIVE
THE DEMOCRATS WHAT THEY WANT,
END THIS.

62
00:03:37,406 --> 00:03:40,760
I THINK WE'RE GOING TO DRAG IT
OUT.
WE'RE GOING TO KEEP THE
GOVERNMENT SHUT DOWN.

63
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:45,123
WE'RE LOOKING INTO PERHAPS
STEALING CHRISTMAS.
WE'LL BE DOING GRINCH.

64
00:03:45,123 --> 00:03:47,135
I LIKE THE GRINCH.
HE'S A GREAT GUY.

65
00:03:47,135 --> 00:03:49,775
OUR WIVES ARE FRIENDS.
WE PLAY GOLF SOMETIMES.

66
00:03:49,775 --> 00:03:51,910
IS HE OKAY?
HE'S OKAY, ALL RIGHT.

67
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:53,833
WELL, IF YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE
HIM TO GET AN MRI,

68
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:56,815
USE THIS,
THIS IS MY PUNCH CARD.

69
00:03:56,815 --> 00:03:59,026
ONE MORE AND THE NEXT ONE'S
FREE.

70
00:03:59,026 --> 00:04:02,868
AND FOR ANYONE WORRIED ABOUT THE
STATE OF THE COUNTRY, I'LL SAY THE SAME THING

71
00:04:02,868 --> 00:04:06,086
I SAID TO MELANIA
WHEN SHE TRIED TO HELP ME DO MY
HAIR.

72
00:04:06,086 --> 00:04:08,792
GO AWAY, WHAT I'M DOING IS VERY
COMPLICATED,

73
00:04:08,792 --> 00:04:10,538
AND ONLY I KNOW HOW
TO DO IT.

74
00:04:10,538 --> 00:04:14,472
AND LIVE FROM NEW YORK, IT'S
SATURDAY NIGHT!

75
00:06:17,336 --> 00:06:21,270
MUSICAL

76
00:06:21,999 --> 00:06:26,506
HOST

77
00:06:29,195 --> 00:06:34,739
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN -- NIKKI
GLASER!

78
00:06:56,091 --> 00:06:59,896
>> THANK YOU!
THANK YOU, THANK YOU SO MUCH.

79
00:06:59,896 --> 00:07:04,168
HI, I AM NIKKI GLASER, AND I AM
SO HAPPY TO BE HERE TONIGHT.

80
00:07:04,168 --> 00:07:06,441
THIS IS TRULY A DREAM COME TRUE.

81
00:07:06,441 --> 00:07:08,696
I LOVE THIS SHOW SO MUCH.

82
00:07:08,696 --> 00:07:10,652
AND HERE I AM IN NEW YORK CITY,

83
00:07:10,652 --> 00:07:13,532
EPSTEIN'S ORIGINAL ISLAND.

84
00:07:14,223 --> 00:07:18,717
OH, IT'S SUCH A SPECIAL NIGHT.
I GOT A SPRAY TAN TONIGHT.

85
00:07:18,717 --> 00:07:21,743
THANK YOU, IT DESERVES THAT,
THANK YOU.

86
00:07:21,743 --> 00:07:25,901
THERE'S SO MANY PASTY WHITE
GIRLS WHO ARE TERRIFIED TO GET SPRAY TANS,

87
00:07:25,901 --> 00:07:28,499
I'M GOING TO LOOK
ORANGE.

88
00:07:28,499 --> 00:07:32,299
JUST -- BELIEVE ME, I PROMISE
YOU, I PROMISE YOU --

89
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:35,134
IT'S
BETTER THAN WHAT YOU ARE, OKAY?

90
00:07:35,134 --> 00:07:38,419
DON'T BE SCARED.
THEY'RE ALWAYS LIKE, I'M GOING
TO LOOK LIKE TRUMP!

91
00:07:38,419 --> 00:07:41,072
BITCH, THAT'S WHY HE WON.

92
00:07:41,072 --> 00:07:45,801
YEAH, HE PICKED AN INSANE SHADE.
HE WENT PRETTY DARK.

93
00:07:45,801 --> 00:07:48,893
HE DIDN'T GO KAMALA, BUT HE
PICKED A SHADE THAT

94
00:07:48,893 --> 00:07:52,938
HALF OF
AMERICA WAS LIKE, OKAY, WE CAN
STILL TELL HE'S WHITE. SO,

95
00:07:52,938 --> 00:07:57,764
I MEAN, IT IS KIND OF INSANE
THAT WHITE PEOPLE CAN JUST PAINT
THEIR SKIN A DIFFERENT COLOR

96
00:07:57,764 --> 00:08:00,279
AND
THEY'RE LIKE, THIS IS COOL,
RIGHT?

97
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:03,682
I FEEL LIKE THAT'S CULTURAL
APPROPRIATION.
I DON'T KNOW. I MEAN,

98
00:08:03,682 --> 00:08:07,433
IT'S NOT BLACKFACE, BUT
IT IS GUATEMALAN LEG.

99
00:08:07,433 --> 00:08:10,242
THIS IS NOT MY LEG.

100
00:08:10,242 --> 00:08:13,245
I'M LIKE, OH, MY GOD, ME, I'M
ALWAYS NIKKI,

101
00:08:13,245 --> 00:08:16,129
LOOK AT THAT.
AM I SAYING THAT
RIGHT?

102
00:08:16,129 --> 00:08:19,802
I GET SHE'S SPRAY TANS.
I BREATHE THE STUFF IN EVERY
WEEK.

103
00:08:19,802 --> 00:08:22,658
I AM DEFINITELY GOING TO GET
SOME KIND OF RESPIRATORY ILLNESS
FROM IT.

104
00:08:22,658 --> 00:08:26,992
IN 20 YEARS THERE'S GOING TO BE
SOME EPIDEMIC CALLED TAN LUNG.

105
00:08:26,992 --> 00:08:31,198
I REALLY WANT TO BE ON THE
COMMERCIALS FOR THE CLASS ACTION
LAWSUIT.

106
00:08:31,198 --> 00:08:33,407
I THINK THAT'S SUCH A GOOD GIG.

107
00:08:33,407 --> 00:08:35,030
IT WILL BE SO FUN FOR YOU, TOO.

108
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:37,896
YOU'LL TURN ON YOUR TV IN THE
MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT AND BE, WHO
IS THAT?

109
00:08:37,896 --> 00:08:40,210
I'LL BE, LIKE, I'M NIKKI GLASER.

110
00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:44,524
YOU MAY RECOGNIZE ME FROM THE
ROAST OF TOM BRADY.

111
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:48,210
IT WILL BE LIKE ME AND SNOOKI.
THAT'S FUN.

112
00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:52,914
JUST TALKING THROUGH OUR TRACHS,
RFK JUNIOR'ing OUT.

113
00:08:52,914 --> 00:08:55,749
HE'S GOT TAN LUNG. I MEAN,

114
00:08:55,749 --> 00:08:58,140
HE'S STAGE 2, I DON'T
KNOW.

115
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:02,178
I'M NO HEALTH EXPERT, BUT
NOTWITHSTANDINGER IS HE.

116
00:09:02,178 --> 00:09:05,440
IT'S JUST CRAZY WE HAVE TO WORRY
ABOUT OUR LOOKS SO MUCH.

117
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,911
IT STARTS SO YOUNG AS A GIRL.

118
00:09:07,911 --> 00:09:10,650
I SAW THIS GIRL THE OTHER DAY.
SHE WAS PROBABLY 6 YEARS OLD.

119
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:12,852
AND HER DAD WAS TRYING TO TAKE A
PICTURE OF HER.

120
00:09:12,852 --> 00:09:14,497
McKENZIE, LOOK OVER HERE.

121
00:09:14,497 --> 00:09:17,000
DAD, GET MY GOOD SIDE.

122
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,951
SHE'S LIKE, "GOOD SIDE."
6.

123
00:09:19,951 --> 00:09:22,110
SO SAD, BECAUSE SHE DIDN'T HAVE
ONE.

124
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:25,018
IT'S LIKE, WHEN IS SHE GOING TO
FIND OUT?

125
00:09:25,018 --> 00:09:27,942
SHE NEEDS TO LEARN A TRADE, YOU
KNOW?

126
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:31,963
HAND HER A WRENCH OR DO COMEDY.
I DON'T KNOW.

127
00:09:31,963 --> 00:09:35,982
I JUST THINK THERE'S SO MANY
THINGS WE DO FOR BEAUTY THAT ARE IMPORTANT,

128
00:09:35,982 --> 00:09:38,278
BUT THERE'S OTHER
ONES I'M LIKE, WHY ARE WE DOING
THIS?

129
00:09:38,278 --> 00:09:41,159
WHO CARES?
LIKE NAILS.
NO ONE CARES.

130
00:09:41,159 --> 00:09:43,131
LIKE, I'VE BEEN WITH MY
BOYFRIEND FOR TEN YEARS.

131
00:09:43,131 --> 00:09:45,705
HE'S NEVER ONCE NOTICED THAT
I'VE GOTTEN MY NAILS DONE.

132
00:09:45,705 --> 00:09:48,939
AND THEY GO INSIDE HIM.
SO IF HE DOESN'T CARE,

133
00:09:48,939 --> 00:09:51,539
WHO DOES?

134
00:09:52,141 --> 00:09:55,896
THE ONLY TIME HE CARED WAS WHEN
I WAS THEM BEDAZZLED FOR HIS
PLEASURE.

135
00:09:55,896 --> 00:09:58,551
THEN HE LOVED THEM.

136
00:09:58,551 --> 00:10:01,416
GOING TO THE NAIL SALON, IT'S SO
BORING.

137
00:10:01,416 --> 00:10:02,733
IT'S SUCH A WASTE OF TIME.

138
00:10:02,733 --> 00:10:05,770
YOU JUST SIT THERE FOR TWO HOURS
JUST PARALYZED.

139
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:08,391
I FEEL LIKE MEN THINK WE GO TO
THE NAIL SALON WITH OUR GIRLFRIENDS

140
00:10:08,391 --> 00:10:10,955
AND CHITCHAT THE
WHOLE TIME, BUT THAT'S NOT THE
CASE.

141
00:10:10,955 --> 00:10:12,685
YOU CAN GO TO THE NAIL SALON
WITH A FRIEND,

142
00:10:12,685 --> 00:10:14,499
BUT YOU GET
SEPARATED AT THE BORDER.

143
00:10:14,499 --> 00:10:17,809
THEY DO NOT LET YOU SIT NEXT TO
EACH OTHER.
IT'S SO ANTISOCIAL.

144
00:10:17,810 --> 00:10:21,684
WATCHING
ON MUTE

145
00:10:21,684 --> 00:10:24,874
YOU CAN'T TALK TO THE WOMAN
DOING YOUR NAILS, BECAUSE

146
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:26,707
SLAVERY?
I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW.

147
00:10:26,707 --> 00:10:31,288
SHE SEEMS STUCK AND SAD.
I DON'T KNOW.

148
00:10:31,288 --> 00:10:33,162
I THINK I'M JUST PARANOID.

149
00:10:33,162 --> 00:10:36,241
I'M JUST KIND OF OBSESSED WITH
SLAVERY RECENTLY, BECAUSE --

150
00:10:36,241 --> 00:10:41,220
EVERY TIME YOU GO TO A WOMEN'S
RESTROOM, A PUBLIC WOMEN'S
RESTROOM, IN THE STALL

151
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:45,578
THERE'S A
POSTER ON THE BACK OF THE STALL
ASKING YOU IF YOU'RE BEING
TRAFFICKED.

152
00:10:45,578 --> 00:10:48,533
WOMEN, WE HAVE THESE, RIGHT?
YES, YES.

153
00:10:48,533 --> 00:10:51,407
IN EVERY STALL, IN EVERY WORLD
LANGUAGE.

154
00:10:51,407 --> 00:10:55,285
ENGLISH IS REALLY TINY AND IT'S
LIKE, "YOU WISH."
BUT IT'S LIKE --

155
00:10:56,645 --> 00:11:00,089
MEN'SEST
RESTROOMS DO NOT HAVE THESE
SIGNS.

156
00:11:00,089 --> 00:11:02,802
I DON'T KNOW WHAT SIGNS YOU
HAVE. MAYBE YOU HAVE SIGNS LIKE,

157
00:11:02,802 --> 00:11:07,400
"WANT
A SLAVE?
TEXT "TRAFFIC" TO 6969."

158
00:11:08,081 --> 00:11:11,060
BUT IT'S REALLY A BIG FEAR OF
BEING TRAFFICKED.

159
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:13,076
MOSTLY FOR GEN-Z GIRLS.

160
00:11:13,076 --> 00:11:15,478
I HAVE A LOT OF GEN-Z FRIENDS
THAT I BOUGHT.

161
00:11:15,478 --> 00:11:18,384
THEY'RE TERRIFIED.

162
00:11:18,384 --> 00:11:20,682
AND I DON'T RELATE.
I'M 41.

163
00:11:20,682 --> 00:11:23,141
THAT WAS LIKE NOT A FEAR OF MINE
EVER IN MY 20s.

164
00:11:23,141 --> 00:11:26,541
IN MY 20s I JUST FEARED GOOD
OLD-FASHIONED RAPE.

165
00:11:26,541 --> 00:11:30,136
I DIDN'T THINK IT WOULD BE A
CAREER.
WE DIDN'T THINK --

166
00:11:30,136 --> 00:11:34,649
IT WAS ANYTHING MORE THAN A TEMP
JOB AT A FRAT HOUSE FUTON. BUT

167
00:11:34,649 --> 00:11:38,180
IT'S REAL.
I'M GETTING SCARED.
IT'S RUBBING OUT WITH ME.

168
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:41,274
RECENTLY
WHAT IF WE GET TRAFFICKED?

169
00:11:41,274 --> 00:11:44,061
THEY'RE LIKE, "YOU'RE GOOD."

170
00:11:45,021 --> 00:11:47,091
THEY'RE LIKE, "WE'RE SAFER WHEN
YOU'RE WITH US

171
00:11:47,091 --> 00:11:50,426
BECAUSE THEY
THINK YOU'RE OUR MADAM."

172
00:11:50,426 --> 00:11:53,685
"YOU HAVE RESTING GHISLAINE"
FACE, SO KEEP THAT UP."

173
00:11:53,685 --> 00:11:55,556
WHAT?

174
00:11:55,556 --> 00:11:59,720
I'M GOING TO GET IT FIXED.
I'M GOING TO GET A FACELIFT
PRETTY SOON HERE.

175
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:03,026
MY BOYFRIEND DOESN'T WANT ME TO.
HE'S LIKE, NO, DON'T DO YOUR FACE,

176
00:12:03,026 --> 00:12:06,082
I LOVE YOUR FACE, DO YOUR
TITS.

177
00:12:06,082 --> 00:12:07,516
WHAT?

178
00:12:07,516 --> 00:12:11,233
THAT'S ALL HE CARES ABOUT.
HE'S A SHORT GUY, THEY'RE ALL HE
SEES, I THINK.

179
00:12:11,233 --> 00:12:13,491
I THINK THAT'S WHY HE'S FOCUSED
ON THEM.

180
00:12:13,491 --> 00:12:17,613
I DO DATE A SHORT GUY, SHORTER
THAN ME, BUT REALLY HOT.

181
00:12:17,613 --> 00:12:19,562
I THINK THAT'S WHY I GOT HIM,

182
00:12:19,562 --> 00:12:22,714
BECAUSE I COULD NEVER GET HIS
FACE ON A TALLER MODEL.

183
00:12:22,714 --> 00:12:26,652
LIKE, IF YOU WANT TO GET A 10 IN
THE FACE, YOU'VE GOT TO GO 5'7"
IN THE HEIGHT.

184
00:12:26,652 --> 00:12:30,717
TRICK
GETTING A HOT GUY ON DISCOUNT.
HE'S MARKED DOWN.

185
00:12:30,717 --> 00:12:34,236
I MET MY BOYFRIEND AT TJ MAXX,
CLEARANCE RACK,

186
00:12:34,236 --> 00:12:36,100
HE WAS HIDING IN
IT.

187
00:12:36,836 --> 00:12:39,863
IT'S CRAZY.
SOMETIMES I'LL POST A PICTURE OF US ONLINE

188
00:12:39,863 --> 00:12:43,657
AND I'LL GET COMMENTS
OF, GIRL, HE'S HOT, HOW DID YOU
GET HIM?

189
00:12:43,657 --> 00:12:46,459
I'M LIKE, IF YOU ZOOMED OUT,
YOU'D SEE HE'S SITTING ON MY
LAP.

190
00:12:46,459 --> 00:12:49,404
THIS IS A TINY GUY.

191
00:12:49,404 --> 00:12:52,261
WENT DIGGING IN THE BARGAIN BIN,
LADIES.

192
00:12:52,261 --> 00:12:56,046
BUT -- YEAH, GIRLS DON'T LIKE
SHORT GUYS.

193
00:12:56,046 --> 00:12:58,915
AND I GUESS IT'S BECAUSE YOU
WANT A TALL GUY

194
00:12:58,915 --> 00:13:01,540
SO THAT YOU CAN
FEEL LIKE, HE CAN PROTECT ME,

195
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:05,085
AND MURDER ME SOMEDAY.
I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S IT.

196
00:13:05,085 --> 00:13:08,206
BUT MY BOYFRIEND'S SHORTER THAN
ME.
I'VE NEVER FELT LIKE HE CAN'T PROTECT ME,

197
00:13:08,206 --> 00:13:11,023
AND I AM CERTAIN HE
WILL MURDER ME SOMEDAY.

198
00:13:11,023 --> 00:13:13,774
HE IS SO FILLED WITH RAGE THAT
HE'S SHORT.

199
00:13:13,774 --> 00:13:16,508
I MEAN, HE IS JUST SIMMERING
WITH ANGER.

200
00:13:16,508 --> 00:13:20,632
AND THAT'S WHY I KEEP OUR GUN ON
THE TOP SHELF.
I CAN'T RISK THAT.

201
00:13:20,632 --> 00:13:24,635
I NEED HIM TO GO GET A
STEPLADDER AND THINK IT THROUGH,
YOU KNOW?

202
00:13:24,635 --> 00:13:29,289
THE NUMBER OF TIMES I'VE WALKED
INTO OUR CLOSET AND SEEN HIM
LIKE --

203
00:13:30,228 --> 00:13:32,900
AND I'M LIKE, "DOES SOMEONE NEED
TO GET UPPY-UPPY

204
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:36,972
TO GET THE
BANG-BANG TO MAKE NIKKI GO
BYE-BYE?"

205
00:13:36,972 --> 00:13:40,639
THEN I GIVE HIM A JUICE BOX, AND
HE FORGETS WHY HE'S UPSET.

206
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:44,071
WE DON'T HAVE KIDS BECAUSE I
DON'T WANT TO PASS DOWN THAT
DNA.

207
00:13:44,071 --> 00:13:48,066
BUT IT'S JUST -- I FEEL LIKE
IT'S TOO HARD TO BE A MOM.

208
00:13:48,066 --> 00:13:51,562
I HAVE TOO MUCH ANXIETY ABOUT
IT.
IT'S HARD BEING AN AUNT.

209
00:13:51,562 --> 00:13:53,939
I WAS STAYING AT MY SISTER'S
HOUSE RECENTLY,

210
00:13:53,939 --> 00:13:56,108
AND AT ONE POINT
I WAS LIKE, "I'M GOING TO GO
TAKE A SHOWER."

211
00:13:56,108 --> 00:14:00,059
MY NEPHEW COMES RUNNING IN, "I
TAKE A SHOWER WITH YOU!"

212
00:14:00,059 --> 00:14:01,206
HE'S 18.

213
00:14:01,206 --> 00:14:05,181
I'M LIKE, WHAT'S GOING ON WITH
HIS VOICE?

214
00:14:05,181 --> 00:14:06,677
SOMETHING'S WRONG.

215
00:14:06,677 --> 00:14:09,530
NO, NO.
HE WAS 4, AND IT WAS VERY CUTE.

216
00:14:09,530 --> 00:14:12,233
MY SISTER'S LIKE, HE CAN TAKE A
SHOWER WITH YOU, IT'S FINE, HE
DOES IT WITH US.

217
00:14:12,233 --> 00:14:13,773
OKAY, THAT'S FINE FOR YOU GUYS

218
00:14:13,773 --> 00:14:18,209
BUT ARE YOU OKAY WITHN AN ADULT
SHOWERING WITH YOUR CHILD?

219
00:14:18,209 --> 00:14:21,191
MAYBE IT'S OKAY IF YOU COME AND
SUPERVISE.

220
00:14:21,191 --> 00:14:25,649
SHE WAS LIKE, WHY?
AND I WAS LIKE, WHAT AM.
I MOLEST HIM?

221
00:14:29,387 --> 00:14:32,622
SHE WAS LIKE, WOULD YOU?
I WAS LIKE, NO!

222
00:14:32,622 --> 00:14:34,891
I WOULD NEVER!
THAT'S DISGUSTING!

223
00:14:34,891 --> 00:14:36,581
BUT THAT'S WHAT I'D SAY IF I WAS
GONNA.

224
00:14:36,581 --> 00:14:40,497
THEY LIE!
DON'T TRUST ANYONE.

225
00:14:40,497 --> 00:14:43,287
I DON'T EVEN TRUST MYSELF.
I DON'T WANT TO GO IN THERE.

226
00:14:43,287 --> 00:14:47,634
HOW DO YOU BECOME A PEDESTRIAN
TILE?
YOU DON'T GET TO CHOOSE WHAT
YOU'RE INTO, DUDE.

227
00:14:47,634 --> 00:14:51,170
WHAT IF IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS
YOU DON'T KNOW YOU LIKE TILL YOU
GET IN THERE AND YOU'RE LIKE,

228
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:52,474
WELL, THIS IS MY THING.

229
00:14:52,474 --> 00:14:56,265
AND IT OPENS UP A PART OF MY
BRAIN.
NO, NO, NO.

230
00:14:56,265 --> 00:14:59,971
I KNOW THAT SOUNDS CRAZY, BUT
THERE HAVE BEEN SO MANY THINGS IN MY LIFE

231
00:14:59,971 --> 00:15:03,737
THAT I'VE BEEN, I
WOULD NEVER DO THAT.

232
00:15:03,737 --> 00:15:07,499
AND NOW I'M LIKE, LOOKS KIND OF
FUN, ACTUALLY.
SO I DON'T KNOW.

233
00:15:07,499 --> 00:15:09,027
THANK YOU GUYS SO MUCH.

234
00:15:09,027 --> 00:15:12,558
WE HAVE SUCH AN INCREDIBLE SHOW
FOR YOU TONIGHT.

235
00:15:12,558 --> 00:15:14,439
SOMBR IS HERE.

236
00:15:14,439 --> 00:15:18,112
SO STICK AROUND, AND WE'LL BE
RIGHT BACK!

237
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:45,483
>>> I TRIED TO TELL HER, BABE,
YOU REALLY DON'T HAVE TO DO
THIS.

238
00:15:45,483 --> 00:15:49,035
>> ARE YOU KIDDING?
I LOVE THAT YOU GUYS DO FAMILY
KARAOKE NIGHTS,

239
00:15:49,035 --> 00:15:50,903
THAT'S SO SWEET.

240
00:15:50,903 --> 00:15:53,051
>> AWW, PETEY, I LIKE HER
ALREADY.

241
00:15:53,051 --> 00:15:55,543
>> THANKS FOR COMING TO OUR
LITTLE FAMILY TRADITION.

242
00:15:55,543 --> 00:15:57,635
>> I KNOW IT'S SILLY, BUT WE
LOVE IT.

243
00:15:57,635 --> 00:16:00,462
>> I'M JUST EXCITED TO MEET YOU
GUYS.

244
00:16:00,462 --> 00:16:04,578
>> ALL RIGHT, PARTY PEOPLE,
DEEJAY FIG-A-LICIOUS ON THE MIC.

245
00:16:04,578 --> 00:16:08,491
IF YOU ARE THE OWNER OF A 2004 COROLLA,

246
00:16:08,491 --> 00:16:11,402
PLEASE TALK TO ME, I'M
CONSIDERING BUYING ONE.

247
00:16:11,402 --> 00:16:15,604
ALL RIGHT, NOW GIVE IT UP FOR
BECKY AND PETEY!

248
00:16:15,604 --> 00:16:17,491
>> WAIT, YOU PUT IN OUR SONG
ALREADY?

249
00:16:17,491 --> 00:16:19,631
>> YOU KNOW I DID, LITTLE BRO,
GET UP THERE.

250
00:16:19,631 --> 00:16:21,860
>> OH, MY GOD.
I'M SORRY, BABE, DUTY CALLS.

251
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:24,074
>> HAVE FUN!

252
00:16:26,730 --> 00:16:30,368
>> THIS IS FOR MY BABY BROTHER.
I LOVE YOU, BUDDY.

253
00:16:30,368 --> 00:16:32,464

GO HOME RIGHT NOW ¶

259
00:16:50,502 --> 00:16:51,963
>> NEVER.

>> GO, KIDS!

271
00:17:35,952 --> 00:17:38,835
KIDS

272
00:17:40,075 --> 00:17:43,936
>> AND THEY'RE FULL SIBLINGS?

273

276
00:17:51,438 --> 00:17:52,908
IT'S PETEY AND BECKY.

277
00:17:52,908 --> 00:17:56,031
>> WHAT?
OH, MY GOSH.
DID YOU PUT ONE IN TOO?

278
00:17:56,031 --> 00:18:00,062
>> OF COURSE I DID, SIS, COME

>> OH, MY GOSH.

279

331
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:44,444
HAVE YOU STOPPED FEELING LIKE
YOURSELF?

332
00:20:44,444 --> 00:20:49,054
ARE YOU OVERCOME WITH AN INTENSE
FEELING OF FOREBODING AND DREAD?

333
00:20:49,054 --> 00:20:52,285
IF SO, YOU MAY BE ONE OF THE
MANY CELEBRITIES

334
00:20:52,285 --> 00:20:56,688
WHO ARE
SCHEDULED TO DANCE THROUGH THE
JENNIFER HUDSON SPIRIT TUNNEL.

335
00:21:01,703 --> 00:21:03,460
>> I LOVE JENNIFER HUDSON.

336
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:06,670
BUT AS AN UNCOORDINATED WHITE
WOMAN, I FELT TRAPPED.

337
00:21:06,670 --> 00:21:11,163
I'D TRIED PRACTICING, BUT
EVERYTHING I CAME UP WITH LOOKED
CAREER-ENDING.

338
00:21:11,163 --> 00:21:13,812
POINTING.
SHOULDER SHRUG.

339
00:21:13,812 --> 00:21:15,544
DRUNK AUNT AT A WEDDING.

340
00:21:15,544 --> 00:21:17,680
I EVEN TRIED TO PUT MY ASS INTO

341
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:19,716
BUT I DON'T HAVE ONE.

342
00:21:19,716 --> 00:21:23,536
I JUST KEPT IMAGINING MYSELF IN
THAT TUNNEL.

343
00:21:23,536 --> 00:21:25,944
¶ COME ON NIKKI YOU'RE SO FINE
YOU'RE SO FINE

344
00:21:25,944 --> 00:21:29,171
YOU BLOW MY MIND
HEY NIKKI HEY NIKKI ¶

345
00:21:29,386 --> 00:21:31,411
>> IT FELT LIKE THERE WAS NO WAY
OUT.

346
00:21:31,411 --> 00:21:34,464
THAT'S WHEN MY DOCTOR TOLD ME
ABOUT HUDSICILLIN.

347
00:21:34,464 --> 00:21:39,567
HUDSICILLIN IS THE
ONLY MEDICATION PROVED TO KILL
SPIRIT TUNNEL RELATED SYMPTOMS

348
00:21:39,567 --> 00:21:41,103
WORKS

349
00:21:41,103 --> 00:21:42,998
NOT BY MAKING YOUR BODY AWAY

350
00:21:42,998 --> 00:21:45,438
BIT BY MAKING YOU SO VIOLENTLY ILL.

351
00:21:45,438 --> 00:21:47,372
YOU HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO
CANCEL.

352
00:21:47,372 --> 00:21:50,419
IT WORKS FAST, MAYBE TOO FAST.

353
00:21:50,419 --> 00:21:54,580
30 SECONDS AFTER MY FIRST DOSE,
I WAS SHAKING ON THE BATHROOM
FLOOR.

354
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:57,052
NOT KNOWING WHICH END OF ME TO
AIM AT THE TOILET.

355
00:21:57,052 --> 00:22:00,074
THAT'S BECAUSE HUDSICILLIN IS
MADE FROM A GENTLE BLEND

356
00:22:00,074 --> 00:22:04,096
OF E.
COLI, INFLUENZA, C. DIFF.
AND RANCID BUTTERMILK.

357

I FINALLY HAVE MY LIFE BACK.

358
00:22:06,563 --> 00:22:10,065
AND NOW MY SPOT IN THE TUNNEL
CAN GO TO SOMEONE WHO REALLY
WANTS IT.

UNDERSTAND.

HE'S NOT JUST ANY BEAST.

>> WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?

379
00:23:43,844 --> 00:23:45,524

00:26:59,519 --> 00:27:02,874
>> AND JESSICA HERE IS A NURSE.
HOW COOL IS THAT?

434
00:27:02,874 --> 00:27:05,322
SHE TAKES SUCH GOOD CARE OF ME.

435
00:27:05,789 --> 00:27:08,114
>> AND JUST LIKE OUR REGULAR DOLLS,

436
00:27:08,114 --> 00:27:11,915
OUR XL DOLLS HAVE
INCREDIBLE ATTENTION TO DETAIL.

437
00:27:11,915 --> 00:27:13,979
>> JUST LOOK AT THE STITCHING ON
MY DOLL'S SUIT.

438
00:27:13,979 --> 00:27:16,914
>> AND ALL THE COOL PATCHES ON
MY ASTRONAUT DOLL.

439
00:27:16,914 --> 00:27:19,737
>> AND MY DOLL'S FEET.
SO LIFELIKE.

440
00:27:19,737 --> 00:27:22,773
>> WHAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT ARE
THEIR STORIES.

441
00:27:22,773 --> 00:27:26,178
SUZANNE HERE WAS THE FIRST
FEMALE JUDGE IN MISSOURI.

442
00:27:26,178 --> 00:27:28,324
>> I MADE UP MY OWN BACKSTORY
FOR JESSICA.

443
00:27:28,324 --> 00:27:29,542
SHE'S FROM LITHUANIA.

444
00:27:29,542 --> 00:27:33,611
>> NO, SHE'S AMERICAN.
>> WELL, SHE IS NOW.

445
00:27:33,611 --> 00:27:36,659
>> MINE HATES HER DAD, AND SHE
WANTS TO BE A SINGER.

446
00:27:36,659 --> 00:27:39,299
THAT'S WHY HER MOUTH IS ALWAYS
OPEN.

447
00:27:39,847 --> 00:27:43,700
>> THE POINT IS, AMERICAN GIRL XL DOLLS

448
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:46,083
WILL INSPIRE WOMEN OF
ALL AGES.

449
00:27:46,083 --> 00:27:49,751
AND YOU CAN EVEN DESIGN YOUR OWN
BASED ON HISTORICAL FIGURES.

450
00:27:49,751 --> 00:27:52,088
>> MINE LOOKS LIKE ROSIE THE
RIVETER.

451
00:27:52,088 --> 00:27:54,474
>> MINE LOOKS LIKE AMELIA
EARHART.

452
00:27:54,474 --> 00:27:56,658
>> MINE LOOKS LIKE MY BROTHER'S
WIFE.

453
00:27:56,658 --> 00:27:59,999
>> NO, THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE
HISTORICAL FIGURES.

454
00:27:59,999 --> 00:28:03,102
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
ABIGAIL HERE IS FROM COLONIAL
TIMES.

455
00:28:03,102 --> 00:28:05,895
THAT'S WHY HER HANDS CHURN
BUTTER.

456
00:28:05,895 --> 00:28:09,314
>> ARE YOU HERE WITH SOMEBODY?
MAYBE YOUR DAUGHTER OR --

457
00:28:09,314 --> 00:28:11,244
>> CLOSE.
MY DAD.

458
00:28:11,244 --> 00:28:14,548
>> MINE'S AN OLYMPIC SKIER.

459
00:28:14,548 --> 00:28:16,120
>> I REALLY DON'T LIKE THAT.

460
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:18,331
>> AND THE BEST PART IS --
>> WAIT, WHO ARE YOU?

461
00:28:18,331 --> 00:28:21,464
>> YOU CAN TAKE THE CLOTHING
FROM YOUR REGULAR AMERICAN GIRL DOLL

462
00:28:21,464 --> 00:28:23,104
AND USE IT ON YOUR XL DOLL.

463
00:28:23,104 --> 00:28:25,419
>> PLEASE, NEVER DO THAT.
WHY WOULD YOU DO THIS TO HER?

464
00:28:25,419 --> 00:28:27,565
>> BECAUSE IT'S FUN AND WE'RE IN
LOVE.

465
00:28:27,565 --> 00:28:29,474
>> AND THEIR HAIR IS SUPER
STRONG.

466
00:28:29,474 --> 00:28:32,419
>> YOU CAN MIX AND MATCH THEIR
PARTS.
I MADE MINE BIRACIAL.

467
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:35,667
>> IF YOU FOLD HER IN HALF, SHE
FITS RIGHT INTO THE DISHWASHER.

468
00:28:35,667 --> 00:28:38,234
>> HEY, WANT TO TRADE FOR A
LITTLE WHILE?
>> I'D LOVE THAT.

469
00:28:38,234 --> 00:28:40,480
>> THAT'S IT, WE'RE SHUTTING THE
STORE DOWN.

470
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:42,402
>> AMERICAN GIRL XL.

471
00:28:42,402 --> 00:28:44,931
THEY MADE AN XL MISTAKE.

472
00:28:44,931 --> 00:28:47,557
>> HONEY, SLOW DOWN, THAT'S YOUR
THIRD MARTINI.

473
00:28:47,557 --> 00:28:50,715
HERE, HAVE SOME OF YOUR HOT DOG.

474
00:28:55,521 --> 00:28:58,503
>>> ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT,

475
00:28:58,503 --> 00:29:01,958
LET'S HEAR IT ONE MORE TIME FOR
ALEXIS!

476
00:29:03,962 --> 00:29:07,702
>> OH, MY GOD, THAT WAS SO
CRAZY.

477
00:29:07,702 --> 00:29:11,865
>> WHAT'S CRAZY IS THAT I'M
GETTING MARRIED IN TWO WEEKS.

478
00:29:12,182 --> 00:29:14,733
>> I WISH IT WAS TO ME.

479
00:29:14,733 --> 00:29:17,344
OOPS, I SAID THAT OUT LOUD.

480
00:29:17,344 --> 00:29:18,824
I'LL BE LEAVING NOW.

481
00:29:18,824 --> 00:29:21,102
>> OKAY.
BYE!

482
00:29:21,102 --> 00:29:23,013
YOU GUYS, THIS IS SO MUCH FUN.

483
00:29:23,013 --> 00:29:25,712
WAIT -- WHERE ARE KAYLA AND
DELULAH?

484
00:29:25,712 --> 00:29:28,209
>> OH, MY GOD, THEY'RE ON THE
BULL.

485
00:29:28,209 --> 00:29:30,081
>> HI, GIRLIES!

486
00:29:30,081 --> 00:29:31,971
>> YEE-HAW, YOU GUYS!

487
00:29:31,971 --> 00:29:36,294
>> ONE AT A TIME, PLEASE, AND
YOU'RE MUCH TOO DRUNK.

488
00:29:36,294 --> 00:29:39,849
>> NO, WE'RE NOT.
I ONLY HAD A MARTINI WITH A
TWIST.

489
00:29:39,849 --> 00:29:43,296
AND THE TWIST, I HAD FOUR
MARGARITAS.

490
00:29:43,296 --> 00:29:46,727
>> LET'S GET THIS DONKEY MOVING,
Y'ALL!
>> YEAH!

491
00:29:46,727 --> 00:29:48,735
>> IT IS NOT A DONKEY.

492
00:29:48,735 --> 00:29:51,555
ANDRE, DO NOT START THAT BULL.

493
00:29:55,395 --> 00:29:58,812
ON THE ONE HAND, I KNOW I'M NOT
SUPPOSED TO DO THIS.

494
00:29:58,812 --> 00:30:01,765
BUT ON THE OTHER HAND -- I WOULD
LIKE TO SEE

495
00:30:01,765 --> 00:30:04,828
TWO BUXOM BABES
BEING BUCKED AROUND ON A BRONCO.

496
00:30:04,828 --> 00:30:08,283
I CALL THIS "ANDRE'S DILEMMA."

497
00:30:08,283 --> 00:30:11,436
DILEMMA SOLVED.
I WILL DO IT.

498
00:30:16,539 --> 00:30:19,597
>> ANDRE!
WHAT SETTING DID YOU PUT IT ON?

499
00:30:19,597 --> 00:30:23,078
>> OH MY DEAR GOODNESS ME, I AM
AFRAID IN MY TITILLATED STATE

500
00:30:23,078 --> 00:30:26,186
I
ACCIDENTALLY SET IT TO "BON
VOYAGE."

ALL OF THIS.

605

HE'S JUST STANDING THERE.
HE'S LITERALLY THIS MEME.

606
00:38:54,590 --> 00:38:59,388
THE CRAZIEST PART IS THAT DURING
THE COMMOTION, RFK JR. JUST RUNS
AWAY.

WATCH, WATCH THIS.

SUCH A WEIRD MOVE.

610
00:39:11,914 --> 00:39:15,358
DON'T WORRY, BY THE WAY.
THE MAN WHO COLLAPSED IS TOTALLY
OKAY.

611
00:39:15,358 --> 00:39:20,191
YOU CAN TELL BECAUSE IF THERE'S
SOMETHING DEAD ON THE GROUND,
RFK EATS IT.

RECEIVING ENDORSEMENTS FROM
DONALD TRUMP AND ERIC ADAMS.

618
00:39:48,058 --> 00:39:50,896

"NOT TO
BRAG BUT I HAVE HELP SITE "B"

WHITE FORD BRONCO.

TO GET AWAY FROM POLICE.

A
FAR-LEFT RADICAL AS WELL AS A
JIHADIST.

JIHADIST.

DO, TURN ISIS INTO THEYSIS?

I WORKED REALLY HARD ON THAT,
COLIN.

>> YEAH, THAT WAS GOOD, I LIKED
THAT.

633

S.N.A.P. BENEFITS, INCLUDING
FOOD STAMPS.

HAVE TO PAY THE BENEFITS.

SAYING HE FEELS
BADLY FOR THE ROYAL FAMILY.

650
00:41:47,272 --> 00:41:51,606
TRUMP EVEN SENT PRINCE ANDREW A
CARD TO CHEER HIM UP, AWW.

AND
TRYING TO KISS AND GROPE HER.

657

WELL.

THE NEW GLASS "BEARISTA" COLD CUP,

659

WHO PASSED
AWAY TWO YEARS AGO.

BABY SHARKS.

666
00:43:00,112 --> 00:43:04,188

THEM IN PRISON.

THINK THAT
PAYING WITH CASH IS CRINGE.

669

YEARS.

LIGHTER TONE.

WONDERING WHY I HAD TO DO A SHOW
IN SAUDI ARABIA,

WE'RE LOSING
MILLIONS ON THIS FERRY.

694
00:44:57,308 --> 00:44:59,802
I ASSUME THAT'S WHAT THE ARTICLE
SAYS.

695

I CAN'T SPEND $5 ON A PAYWALL

>> GOOD LORD.
>> NO?
ALL RIGHT.

710
00:45:49,771 --> 00:45:52,171
WE EVEN GAVE THE BOAT A NEW
NAME.

711
00:45:52,171 --> 00:45:54,908
WE THOUGHT "THE STATEN ISLAND
FERRY" SOUNDED TOO DEPRESSING.

712
00:45:54,908 --> 00:45:57,428
NOW IT'S CALLED "THE TITANIC 2."

713

>> IT'S GOING VERY WELL.

714
00:45:59,753 --> 00:46:03,477

00:46:55,701 --> 00:46:58,146
IF YOU DON'T MIND, I HAVE A
MESSAGE FOR EVERYONE

727
00:46:58,146 --> 00:47:00,495
WHO DID NOT
VOTE FOR OUR NEW MAYOR.

728
00:47:00,495 --> 00:47:03,172
HEY, STATEN ISLANDERS!

729
00:47:03,916 --> 00:47:07,505
DID YOU PROMISE TO MOVE OUT OF
NEW YORK IF MAMDANI WON

730
00:47:07,505 --> 00:47:11,017
BUT HAVE
TOO MANY WARRANTS IN NEW JERSEY
AND NOT ENOUGH GUNS FOR FLORIDA?

731
00:47:11,017 --> 00:47:14,649
WELCOME TO NEW STATEN ISLAND!

732
00:47:14,649 --> 00:47:17,953
IT WILL HAVE EVERYTHING THAT
MAKES STATEN ISLAND GREAT.

733
00:47:17,953 --> 00:47:19,682
THE PIZZA.

734
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:24,886
>> THAT WAS THE WHOLE LIST?
>> YEP.

735
00:47:24,886 --> 00:47:26,264
NEW STATEN ISLAND.

736
00:47:26,264 --> 00:47:28,545
WE CAN'T CALL IT THE TITANIC
ANYMORE

737
00:47:28,545 --> 00:47:32,954
SINCE THE PEOPLE ON THIS
SHIP WILL ACTUALLY LOVE RUNNING
INTO ICE.

738
00:47:33,887 --> 00:47:37,001
THAT WAS PRETTY GOOD.
GOT IT GOING, YEP.

739
00:47:37,001 --> 00:47:38,049
STILL GOT IT.

740
00:47:38,049 --> 00:47:40,112
>> I JUST FEEL LIKE IT'S GOING
TO BE A BIG YEAR FOR US.

741
00:47:40,112 --> 00:47:42,309
>> I THINK SO TOO, I COULDN'T BE
MORE EXCITED.

742
00:47:42,309 --> 00:47:44,477
MY POINT IS, LOOK, THE FERRY,
IT'S FINE.

743
00:47:44,477 --> 00:47:47,933
SOMETIMES THE NEWS JUST MAKES
THINGS SEEM WORSE THAN THEY ARE.

744
00:47:47,933 --> 00:47:51,581
LIKE HOW EVERYONE WAS SURE
CERTAIN PEOPLE WOULD BE EXPOSED

745
00:47:51,581 --> 00:47:53,340
AND RUINED FOR PEOPLE ON THE
EPSTEIN LIST.

746
00:47:53,340 --> 00:47:56,874
IT'S 2025 AND ALL THREE OF US
ARE STILL UP HERE.

747
00:47:56,874 --> 00:47:59,271
>> PETE DAVIDSON, EVERYONE.

748
00:47:59,271 --> 00:48:05,301
FOR "WEEKEND UPDATE," I'M COLIN
JOST.

749
00:48:28,908 --> 00:48:31,208
YAY

750
00:48:31,208 --> 00:48:35,728
THE THEME OF OUR DELTA GAMMA
THANKSGIVING PARTY WILL BE,

751
00:48:35,728 --> 00:48:37,369
PILL GRIM HOS

752
00:48:37,369 --> 00:48:41,534
AND RESPECTFUL
REPRESENTATION OF INDIGENOUS
PEOPLE.

753
00:48:42,507 --> 00:48:45,523
ALL RIGHT, GUYS.
NEXT ACTION ITEM.

754
00:48:45,523 --> 00:48:48,303
THIS IS PRETTY SERIOUS, OKAY?

755
00:48:48,303 --> 00:48:50,642
I GOT AN EMAIL FROM THE GREEK
LIFE ADVISER,

756
00:48:50,642 --> 00:48:54,506
AND APPARENTLY
ANOTHER SORORITY JUST LEARNED
ONE OF THEIR PLEDGES

757
00:48:54,506 --> 00:48:58,885
WAS
ACTUALLY A FRAT GUY IN A
HYPER-REALISTIC GIRL MASK.

758
00:48:58,885 --> 00:49:01,348
>> NO WAY.
>> WHAT?
>> WHAT?

759
00:49:01,348 --> 00:49:03,619
>> OH, MY GOD, THAT'S SO WEIRD.

760
00:49:03,619 --> 00:49:06,175
>> YEAH, THAT IS SO WEIRD!

761
00:49:06,175 --> 00:49:10,082
>> I KNOW.
WELL, THEY ASKED US TO JUST STAY
VIGILANT, OKAY?

762
00:49:10,082 --> 00:49:14,801
I'M JUST ASKING YOU, IF YOU SEE
ANYTHING, JUST SAY SOMETHING,
OKAY?

763
00:49:14,801 --> 00:49:19,013
>> UM, SO I DON'T WANT TO, LIKE,
CALL SOMEONE OUT OR WHATEVER.

764
00:49:19,013 --> 00:49:23,000
BUT I THINK SOMEONE IN OUR
SORORITY HEAT BE A FRAT GUY IN A
HERE REALISTIC MASK.

765
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:24,910
>> WHAT?
>> WHAT, NO WAY.

766
00:49:24,910 --> 00:49:27,279
>> WHAT THE HELL?

767
00:49:27,279 --> 00:49:30,164
>> I THINK IT'S ALYSSA.

768
00:49:30,164 --> 00:49:32,867
>> WAIT.
ME?

769
00:49:32,867 --> 00:49:35,443
>> ARE YOU CRAZY?
>> SO MEAN.

770
00:49:35,443 --> 00:49:36,730
>> SHAME ON YOU, MADDIE.

771
00:49:36,730 --> 00:49:38,947
>> THAT'S MESSED UP.
>> YEAH.

772
00:49:38,947 --> 00:49:42,457
>> WHAT THE HELL, MADDIE?
HAVE SOME RESPECT FOR YOUR
SISTER.

773
00:49:42,457 --> 00:49:46,657
>> SORRY.
YOU SAID SAY SOMETHING IF YOU
SAW SOMETHING STRANGE.

774
00:49:46,657 --> 00:49:50,736
>> JUST SAY IT, MADDIE.
YOU THINK ALYSSA'S UGLY.

775
00:49:50,736 --> 00:49:54,345
HOW TO THE ABSOLUTE DARE YOU!

776
00:49:54,345 --> 00:49:56,960
DELTA GAMMAS DON'T JUDGE
PEOPLE'S LOOKS.

777
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:58,274
DID YOU FORGET OUR MOTTO?

778
00:49:58,274 --> 00:50:01,772
DON'T JUDGE PEOPLE'S LOOKS.

779
00:50:01,855 --> 00:50:05,599
WE JUDGE PEOPLE BY HOW MUCH
MONEY THEIR PARENTS MAKE.

780
00:50:05,599 --> 00:50:10,146
>> OKAY, YEAH.
THIS ISN'T ABOUT ALYSSA, MADDIE,
IT'S ABOUT YOU.

781
00:50:10,146 --> 00:50:12,600
YOU ALWAYS GET ON NEW SISTERS.

782
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:14,232
YOU WERE AWFUL TO ME LAST YEAR,

783
00:50:14,232 --> 00:50:17,215
NOW YOU'RE ACCUSING HER OF BEING
A FRAT GUY IN A MASK?

784
00:50:17,215 --> 00:50:19,513
THAT'S DISGUSTING.

785
00:50:19,513 --> 00:50:22,049
>> DISGUSTING!

786
00:50:22,049 --> 00:50:25,971
>> OKAY, DO YOU SEE HOW SHE
EATS?
THAT IS NOT NORMAL.

787
00:50:25,971 --> 00:50:27,190
>> WHAT?

788
00:50:27,190 --> 00:50:30,657
>> YOU'RE JUST JEALOUS OF WHAT
AN AMAZING PERSON ALYSSA IS.

789
00:50:30,657 --> 00:50:33,755
HER CONTRIBUTION TO DELTA GAMMA
IS UNMATCHED.

790
00:50:33,755 --> 00:50:38,200
SHE'S JUST A FIRST YEAR AND
SHE'S ALREADY PLANNED NOT ONE,
NOT TWO,

791
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:40,768
BUT 15 BIKINI CAR WASH
FUND-RAISERS.

792
00:50:40,768 --> 00:50:43,910
>> YEAH, GIRL POWER!

793
00:50:43,910 --> 00:50:47,527
>> DON'T YOU THINK IT'S
SUSPICIOUS THAT SHE NEVER
PARTICIPATES?

794
00:50:47,527 --> 00:50:49,410
>> SHE'S ALLERGIC TO THE SUN.

795
00:50:49,410 --> 00:50:51,994
IT'S JUST SAFER FOR HER TO WATCH
FROM THE GARAGE,

796
00:50:51,994 --> 00:50:55,689
WEARING
SUNGLASSES, WITH A PILE OF
TOWELS ON HER LAP.

797
00:50:55,959 --> 00:51:00,347
I'M SORRY, MADDIE, BUT YOUR
THEORY IS REJECTED DUE TO LACK
OF PROOF.

798
00:51:00,347 --> 00:51:04,327
>> CAN MY PROOF BE HER VAPING
RIGHT NOW?

799
00:51:04,327 --> 00:51:07,999
THE SMOKE IS COMING OUT OF HER
EYEHOLES.

800
00:51:07,999 --> 00:51:10,963
HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN THIS?

801
00:51:10,963 --> 00:51:13,652
>> IT JUST DOES THAT!

802
00:51:13,652 --> 00:51:18,047
>> MADDIE, STOP.
YOU'RE MAKING ALYSSA SAD.

803
00:51:18,047 --> 00:51:20,068
LOOK.

804
00:51:25,950 --> 00:51:28,625
>> SO SAD.

805
00:51:33,311 --> 00:51:35,513
>> MAYBE I SHOULD JUST GO.

806
00:51:35,513 --> 00:51:37,882
>> NO!
>> DON'T GO!

807
00:51:37,882 --> 00:51:43,113
>> CAN WE JUST TAKE A MOMENT AND
LOOK AT WHAT'S INSIDE HER PURSE?

808
00:51:43,113 --> 00:51:46,790
A HUGE UNOPENED BOX OF MAXI
PADS.
>> WHAT?

809
00:51:46,790 --> 00:51:48,787
>> A BEANIE BABY.
>> WHAT?

810
00:51:48,787 --> 00:51:52,423
>> AND A FRAMED PHOTO OF HILLARY
CLINTON.

811
00:51:52,423 --> 00:51:53,711
>> AND?

812
00:51:53,711 --> 00:51:57,628
>> AND THAT LOOKS LIKE A STUPID
GUY WOULD THINK GIRLS HAVE IN
THEIR PURSE.

813
00:51:57,628 --> 00:52:00,888
>> I'MA SLAP THIS BITCH.
>> CALM DOWN,

814
00:52:00,888 --> 00:52:04,130
JESUS. THIS DISCUSSION IS OVER.
ALL RIGHT?

815
00:52:04,192 --> 00:52:05,784
MEETING ADJOURNED.

816
00:52:05,784 --> 00:52:08,464
>> GIVE ME MY PURSE.
>> OKAY.

817
00:52:08,464 --> 00:52:13,801
>> I'M SO SORRY FOR ALL OF THIS,
ALYSSA.
>> IT'S OKAY.

818
00:52:14,416 --> 00:52:16,804
BYE!

819
00:52:16,804 --> 00:52:20,672
OH, MY GOD.
I'M GOING TO PASS OUT IN THIS
THING.

820
00:52:20,672 --> 00:52:22,863
>> ALYSSA?

821
00:52:22,863 --> 00:52:25,456
>> UH -- I CAN EXPLAIN.

822
00:52:25,456 --> 00:52:27,978
>> NO NEED.

823
00:52:28,518 --> 00:52:31,014
SECRET'S SAFE WITH ME, MAN.

824
00:52:37,843 --> 00:52:41,579
BRAD.

825
00:52:41,579 --> 00:52:42,794
DAD.

826
00:52:42,794 --> 00:52:45,094
DIVORCE

827
00:52:49,645 --> 00:52:52,354
MEDKIT

828
00:52:52,354 --> 00:52:55,761
DON'T SIT IN YOUR ROOM, PLAY
VIDEO GAMES ALL WEEKEND.
ALL RIGHT?

829
00:52:55,761 --> 00:52:58,724
COME ON, LET'S GO OUTSIDE.
>> OKAY.

830
00:52:59,547 --> 00:53:02,556
>> I'M SERIOUS, BUD, COME ON.
SAY GOOD-BYE TO YOUR FRIENDS.

831
00:53:02,556 --> 00:53:04,798
>> OKAY, I JUST LITERALLY NEED
ONE SECOND.

832
00:53:04,798 --> 00:53:06,385
>> ONE.

833
00:53:06,673 --> 00:53:08,768
>> ANYONE HAVE A SHIELD JACK?

834
00:53:08,768 --> 00:53:09,971
>> ALL RIGHT, GIVE ME THE --

835
00:53:09,971 --> 00:53:12,514
SORRY, FELLOWS.
BRAD'S GOT TO GO.

836
00:53:12,514 --> 00:53:16,039
HEY!
FIRST OF ALL, YOU NEVER CALL
SOMEONE THAT WORD.

837
00:53:16,039 --> 00:53:19,087
SECOND OF ALL, IT MAKES NO SENSE
'CAUSE I'M WHITE.

838
00:53:19,087 --> 00:53:20,304
LITTLE JACKASS.

839
00:53:20,304 --> 00:53:24,865
GET YOUR SHOES ON, BUD.
TAKING YOU SOMEPLACE FUN.
>> WHERE?

840
00:53:26,365 --> 00:53:29,367
>> WHY DO I KEEP GETTING THIS
STUFF?

841
00:53:29,367 --> 00:53:32,082
>> DAD, I'M TOO OLD FOR THE
PLAYGROUND.

842
00:53:32,082 --> 00:53:35,482
>> NO, YOU'RE NOT, YOU'RE 10.
>> I'M 11, THOUGH.

843
00:53:35,482 --> 00:53:38,971
>> I KNOW.
BUT COME ON, GO DOWN THE SLIDE.

844
00:53:38,971 --> 00:53:41,949
HEADFIRST!
HEADFIRST!

845
00:53:42,560 --> 00:53:46,058
ALL RIGHT, FEETFIRST IS GOOD,
FEETFIRST IS FINE.

846
00:53:50,766 --> 00:53:54,262
YOU ALL RIGHT?
>> COMING.

847
00:53:56,012 --> 00:53:58,804
SCRAPING MY SKIN.

848
00:54:01,327 --> 00:54:03,703
>> SCOOT, BRAD.
SCOOT.

849
00:54:03,703 --> 00:54:06,940
YEAH, MAYBE YOU ARE TOO BIG FOR
THIS, ALL RIGHT.

850
00:54:09,496 --> 00:54:11,351
>>> LOOK WHAT I FOUND, BUD.

851
00:54:11,351 --> 00:54:14,066
RUN OUT 10 YARDS, FAKE RIGHT,

852
00:54:14,066 --> 00:54:16,119
GO LEFT, I'LL HIT YOU ON THE CROSS.
YOU READY?

853
00:54:16,119 --> 00:54:18,061
>> ONE SEC.

854
00:54:22,402 --> 00:54:23,442
OKAY.

855
00:54:23,442 --> 00:54:25,264
>> HUT, HUT, HIKE!

856
00:54:25,264 --> 00:54:28,468
GOT TO GO ON HIKE, BUD.
HIKE!

857
00:54:28,468 --> 00:54:31,256
BRAD, LOOK AT ME, LOOK AT ME.

858
00:54:32,470 --> 00:54:35,647
YOU'RE ALL RIGHT.
YOU'RE ALL RIGHT.

859
00:54:37,289 --> 00:54:39,643
SPAWNING

860
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:42,946
BRAD, WHAT THE HECK IS THIS?

861
00:54:42,946 --> 00:54:44,849
>> WHOA, IS THAT A DRONE?

862
00:54:44,849 --> 00:54:47,378
>> YEAH.
I GOT IT FOR YOU.
MERRY

863
00:54:47,378 --> 00:54:48,781
THERE YOU GO.

864
00:54:48,781 --> 00:54:53,004
ALL RIGHT, LOOK.
JUST REMEMBER, GENTLE MOVEMENTS
ON THE CONTROLLER, OKAY?

865
00:54:53,004 --> 00:54:54,259
>> I KNOW.

866
00:54:54,629 --> 00:54:57,110
>> GODDAMMIT.

867
00:54:59,599 --> 00:55:02,588
>>> THERE'S A GUY ON YOUR LEFT.
ON MY HILL.

868
00:55:02,588 --> 00:55:04,414
NICE.

869
00:55:04,414 --> 00:55:06,604
OH, THAT'S YOUR MOM.

870
00:55:06,604 --> 00:55:09,581
I LOVE YOU.

871
00:55:09,581 --> 00:55:11,670
>> I LOVE YOU TOO, DAD.

872
00:55:11,670 --> 00:55:15,663
>> I LOVE YOU MORE THAN YOUR MOM
DOES.

873
00:55:15,663 --> 00:55:19,829
DON'T TELL HER I SAID THAT, BUT
IT'S TRUE.
OKAY?
>> OKAY.

874
00:55:21,387 --> 00:55:24,685
BYE, DAD.
>> BYE, SON.

875
00:55:25,756 --> 00:55:28,487
OH, SON OF A BITCH!

876
00:55:52,930 --> 00:55:56,106
FOREVER

877
00:55:56,106 --> 00:55:58,705
>> I KNOW, WE WERE SUPPOSED TO
TAKE OFF A HALF-HOUR AGO.

878
00:55:58,705 --> 00:56:02,634
>> LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WE DO
APOLOGIZE FOR THE DELAY.

879
00:56:02,634 --> 00:56:07,070
AS YOU KNOW, THE GOVERNMENT
SHUTDOWN HAS AFFECTED THE
FLIGHTS AROUND THE COUNTRY.

880
00:56:07,070 --> 00:56:10,563
I'M NOT BLAMING ANYONE, MAMDANI, BUT

881
00:56:10,563 --> 00:56:15,055
WE'RE DOING OUR BEST TO MOVE
YOU GUYS AROUND ONCE AGAIN.

882
00:56:15,055 --> 00:56:17,988
WE DO APOLOGIZE, AND THANK YOU.

883
00:56:17,988 --> 00:56:20,525
>> GOD, THIS ABSOLUTELY STINKS.

884
00:56:20,525 --> 00:56:23,410
>> HEY, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
FROM THE FLIGHT DECK, THIS IS
YOUR CAPTAIN SPEAKING.

885
00:56:23,410 --> 00:56:27,195
JUST GOT WORD FROM THE TOWER.
IT'S GOING TO BE A BIT LONGER
HERE ON THE TARMAC.

886
00:56:27,195 --> 00:56:28,785
PROBABLY IN ABOUT 15 MINUTES,

887
00:56:28,785 --> 00:56:31,420
I'LL COME BACK ON AND TELL YOU
IT'S GOING TO BE TWO MORE HOURS.

888
00:56:31,420 --> 00:56:34,547
GOOD NEWS IS, FINE WEATHER
COMING OUT OF CLEVELAND.

889
00:56:34,547 --> 00:56:36,844
SHOULD BE A SMOOTH FLIGHT ONCE
WE GET UP IN THE AIR.

890
00:56:36,844 --> 00:56:39,239
>> WE'RE GOING TO BE HERE
FOREVER.

891
00:56:39,239 --> 00:56:41,883
>> TRUTH BE TOLD, CAN'T WAIT TO
GET TO CLEVELAND MYSELF.

892
00:56:41,883 --> 00:56:46,180
GOING TO BE MEETING UP WITH A
YOUNG LADY OUT THERE.
I MET HER ON THE APPS.

893
00:56:46,180 --> 00:56:50,794
ALWAYS SAID I WOULDN'T DO THE
APPS BUT LAST NIGHT I GOT A
LITTLE RUM IN MY, WHAT THE HELL.

894
00:56:50,794 --> 00:56:53,204
COPILOT RITCHIE HERE SET ME UP
WITH A PROFILE.

895
00:56:53,204 --> 00:56:55,380
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
ALREADY

896
00:56:55,380 --> 00:56:57,935
IF YOU FOLLOW MY LEAD, YOU'RE
GOING TO BE SWIMMING IN IT.

897
00:56:57,935 --> 00:57:00,319
>> THAT'S WONDERFUL, RITCHIE.

898
00:57:00,319 --> 00:57:05,093
ALREADY MATCHED WITH A CUTE,
YEAH, A CUTE ABOUT 7.5

899
00:57:05,093 --> 00:57:07,248
GIRL,
SORT OF MY SWEET SPOT.

900
00:57:07,248 --> 00:57:10,157
WELL, OUT OF MY RANGE, BUT
ATTAINABLE.

901
00:57:10,157 --> 00:57:13,112
JUST SENT HER A RISKY TEXT.

902
00:57:13,112 --> 00:57:15,043
SHE SAID, HOPPING IN THE SHOWER.

903
00:57:15,125 --> 00:57:17,402
AND I SAID, WITHOUT ME?
HA HA.

904
00:57:17,402 --> 00:57:20,401
MONKEY COVERING EYES.

905
00:57:20,401 --> 00:57:23,239
BEEN ABOUT 20 MINUTES, NO
RESPONSE.

906
00:57:23,239 --> 00:57:25,434
BEEN
GET YOU AN UPDATE SOON.

907
00:57:25,434 --> 00:57:27,304
SIT BACK AND ENJOY THE FLIGHT.

908
00:57:27,304 --> 00:57:30,830
>> OKAY, WELL, THAT'S INSANE.
>> I KNOW.

909
00:57:30,830 --> 00:57:33,006
SHE'S TOTALLY LEADING HIM ON.

910
00:57:33,006 --> 00:57:36,633
HOPPING IN THE SHOWER!
OOH, I'M A LITTLE NAKED LADY,

911
00:57:36,633 --> 00:57:39,263
HOPE I DON'T GET BUBBLES ON MY
BOOBIES!

912
00:57:39,263 --> 00:57:40,608
WHORE.

913
00:57:40,608 --> 00:57:42,455
GOD

914
00:57:42,455 --> 00:57:44,493
>> CAPTAIN DAVE.

915
00:57:44,493 --> 00:57:48,199
LOOKS LIKE WE'VE GOT ABOUT 576
PLANES IN FRONT OF US.

916
00:57:48,199 --> 00:57:51,092
BUT GOOD NEWS IS MAN IN THE
TOWER SAYS HE'S ON TOP OF IT.

917
00:57:51,092 --> 00:57:55,402
BAD NEWS IS, BY IT, I MEAN THE
TOWER ITSELF.
A COUPLE OF PEOPLE TRYING TO
TALK HIM DOWN.

918
00:57:55,402 --> 00:57:59,244
BUT WE SHOULD HAVE YOU IN
CLEVELAND BY CHRISTMAS.

919
00:57:59,244 --> 00:58:01,308
>> IT'S NOVEMBER 8th!

920
00:58:01,308 --> 00:58:05,354
>> AND EVEN WORSE NEWS, I
DECIDED TO DOUBLE TEXT.

921
00:58:05,354 --> 00:58:07,783
NOT GOING TO LIE, IT'S PRETTY
BAD.

922
00:58:07,783 --> 00:58:11,414
SENT A GIF OF JACK NICHOLSON
KNOCKING DOWN THE DOOR IN "THE
SHINING."

923
00:58:11,414 --> 00:58:16,157
POKING HIS HEAD IN, CAPTIONED
IT, "ME IF I WAS THERE RIGHT
NOW."

924
00:58:16,333 --> 00:58:18,026
HATED IT AS SOON AS I SENT IT.

925
00:58:18,026 --> 00:58:21,611
>> I TOLD YOU WHAT YOU NEED TO
SAY TO THIS GIRL IS --

926
00:58:23,550 --> 00:58:24,847
THAT'S
COLORFUL.

927
00:58:24,847 --> 00:58:28,610
FOLKS, FROM THE FLIGHT DECK,
BASICALLY THE GIST OF RITCHIE'S PITCH

928
00:58:28,610 --> 00:58:31,173
WAS SOMETHING ABOUT
SLATHERING A CERTAIN PART OF HER
BODY IN BUTTER,

929
00:58:31,173 --> 00:58:34,567
THEN CRACKING
HER OPEN LIKE A CRAB LEG.
DON'T THINK I'LL TEXT THAT.

930
00:58:34,567 --> 00:58:37,509
IF YOU HAVE ANY IDEAS, PLEASE
LET A FLIGHT ATTENDANT KNOW.

931
00:58:37,509 --> 00:58:40,785
HIT THAT CALL BUTTON.
SIT BACK AND ENJOY THE FLIGHT.

932
00:58:40,785 --> 00:58:43,144

933
00:58:43,145 --> 00:58:45,126
HOT

934
00:58:45,126 --> 00:58:48,653
WOULDN'T MIND YOU CHOPPING
DOWN THE DOOR TO SEE ME IN THE
SHOWER.

935
00:58:48,653 --> 00:58:51,949
>> TO SEE WHAT, SOMETHING I SEE
FOR FREE EVERY DAY?

936
00:58:51,949 --> 00:58:53,569
NO THANK YOU.

937
00:58:53,569 --> 00:58:58,001
>> FOLKS, CAPTAIN DAVE HERE.
UPDATE FROM THE TOWER.

938
00:58:58,001 --> 00:59:00,798

NO NEWS FROM THE TOWER.

939
00:59:00,798 --> 00:59:02,143
UPDATE FROM MY TEXT SAGA.

940
00:59:02,143 --> 00:59:06,391

941
00:59:06,391 --> 00:59:10,080

TO SAY IS, WORD FOR WORD --

943
00:59:16,002 --> 00:59:17,782
I CAN'T SAY ANY OF THOSE WORDS.

944
00:59:17,782 --> 00:59:21,218
YOU KNOW, I WOULD LOVE TO HEAR A
WOMAN'S PERSPECTIVE.

945
00:59:21,218 --> 00:59:23,867
MAYBE EVEN A GAY GUY.
ONE OF THE NICE ONES, THOUGH.

946
00:59:23,867 --> 00:59:27,099
NOT A GYM GAY.
SORT OF ALL ABOUT HIS BODY.

947
00:59:27,099 --> 00:59:30,219
I WANT A NICE ONE.
A "MODERN FAMILY" TYPE.

948
00:59:30,219 --> 00:59:34,194
MAYBE EVEN AN OLDER AFRICAN
AMERICAN GENTLEMAN.
THAT MIGHT BE NICE.

KIND OF A GROWN-ASS MAN TYPE,

CAPTAIN HAS REQUESTED THE HELP

951
00:59:40,857 --> 00:59:45,628
OF A WOMAN, A NOT-MEAN GAY, OR A
GROWN AND SEXY BLACK MAN.

AS SHE GREW OLDER, SHE VISITED
LESS AND LESS.

995
