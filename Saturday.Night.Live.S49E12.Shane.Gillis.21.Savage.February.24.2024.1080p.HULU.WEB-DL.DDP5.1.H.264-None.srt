1
00:00:04,029 --> 00:00:07,107
>>> SENATOR RICH, MIND IF I JOIN
YOU?

2
00:00:11,833 --> 00:00:15,871
>> SENATOR RUBIO, OF COURSE,
HAVE A SEAT.
>> THANK YOU.

3
00:00:15,871 --> 00:00:18,925
>> DECEMBER WE BETTER TOAST TO
PRESIDENT TRUMP.

4
00:00:18,925 --> 00:00:21,982
THAT WAS A BIG VICTORY TONIGHT.
21 POINTS.

5
00:00:21,982 --> 00:00:24,993
>> YES, SIR.
WELL, THERE WAS NEVER ANY DOUBT.

6
00:00:25,076 --> 00:00:27,470
I GUESS TRUMP OWNS THE
REPUBLICAN PARTY NOW.

7
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:29,823
>> YEAH.
I GOT TO ADMIT, THOUGH.

8
00:00:29,823 --> 00:00:33,617
SOMETIMES I DO NOT KNOW WHAT MY
PARTY IS DOING.

9
00:00:33,617 --> 00:00:37,950
I MEAN, I'VE BEEN PUSHING FOR
UKRAINE FUNDING FOR THE PAST SIX
MONTHS.

10
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:40,527
IT'S ESSENTIAL TO AMERICAN
SECURITY.

11
00:00:40,527 --> 00:00:43,514
AND TRUMP JUST KILLED IT WITH
ONE PHONE CALL.

12
00:00:43,514 --> 00:00:47,212
THE MAN DOESN'T CARE ABOUT THIS
COUNTRY ONE IOTA.

13
00:00:47,212 --> 00:00:49,420
SOMETIMES I THINK HE'S DOWNRIGHT
DANGEROUS.

14
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:53,541
>> HM.
AND YOU JUST ENDORSED HIM,
RIGHT?
>> YEAH, BIG-TIME,

15
00:00:53,625 --> 00:00:55,278
HE'S GREAT.
>> SO GREAT.

16
00:00:55,278 --> 00:00:58,598
>> HE IS INCREDIBLE.
>> UH-HUH.

17
00:00:59,488 --> 00:01:04,474
>> NOW, TRUMP GAVE YOU THE NAME
LITTLE MARCO.
RIGHT?

18
00:01:04,674 --> 00:01:07,331
>> UH, YEAH, YEAH.
I'VE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO SHAKE
IT.

19
00:01:07,331 --> 00:01:11,650
PEOPLE STILL YELL IT AT ME IN
AIRPORTS.
HE KIND OF MADE MY LIFE HELL.

20
00:01:12,049 --> 00:01:15,099
>> AND YOU ENDORSED HIM, RIGHT?
>> ABSOLUTELY.

21
00:01:15,099 --> 00:01:17,375
>> BIG-TIME.
THAT GUY'S JUST THE BEST.

22
00:01:17,375 --> 00:01:20,376
THE BEST.
HE'S AMAZING, AMAZING.

23
00:01:20,376 --> 00:01:22,793
>> SOUTH CAROLINA IN THE HOUSE.

24
00:01:22,793 --> 00:01:26,959
>> WELL, WELL.
SENATOR GRAHAM.
SENATOR SCOTT.

25
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:29,574
GET IN HERE, JOIN US, GET YOUR
BUTTS IN HERE.

26
00:01:29,574 --> 00:01:31,857
>> WITH PLEASURE, WITH PLEASURE.

27
00:01:32,872 --> 00:01:35,198
>> Y'ALL TALKING ABOUT TRUMP?
>> UH-HUH.

28
00:01:35,198 --> 00:01:37,475
YOU KNOW WE ARE.
YES, SIR.

29
00:01:37,475 --> 00:01:41,576
>> OH, HEY TIM, I SAW YOU WITH
TRUMP ON THAT LAURA INGRAHAM
TOWN HALL LAST WEEK.

30
00:01:41,679 --> 00:01:44,266
KIND OF ROUGH, RIGHT?
YOU WERE SITTING RIGHT THERE,

31
00:01:44,266 --> 00:01:47,380
HE
SAID TO THE CROWD THAT YOU'VE
BEEN A MUCH BETTER CANDIDATE FOR HIM

32
00:01:47,445 --> 00:01:49,497
THAN YOU EVER WERE FOR
YOURSELF.

33
00:01:49,497 --> 00:01:52,440
>> YEAH, HE'S SO FUNNY.
>> HE'S HILARIOUS.

34
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:55,018
>> SUPER FUNNY.

35
00:01:55,018 --> 00:01:58,168
>> A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO HE MADE
YOU STAND IN FRONT OF A CROWD

36
00:01:58,168 --> 00:01:59,857
ASK SAY YOU HATE NIKKI HALEY.

37
00:01:59,857 --> 00:02:02,071
ISN'T SHE THE ONE WHO APPOINTED
YOU IN THE SENATE?

38
00:02:02,071 --> 00:02:05,109
>> NO, NO, HE DIDN'T MAKE ME SAY
THAT I HATE HER.

39
00:02:05,109 --> 00:02:06,994
HE SAID, "YOU MUST REALLY HATE
HER."

40
00:02:06,994 --> 00:02:08,869
BUT Y'ALL SAW WHAT I DID.

41
00:02:08,869 --> 00:02:12,964
I STEPPED RIGHT UP TO THE MIC
AND I SAID, "NO, I JUST LOVE
YOU."

42
00:02:12,964 --> 00:02:17,263
>> WOW.
YOU SHOWED HIM.
VERY COOL.

43
00:02:18,664 --> 00:02:21,535
>> YEAH, I DO LOVE HIM, THOUGH,
HE'S GREAT, HE'S GREAT.

44
00:02:21,535 --> 00:02:24,994
>> HE IS SO GREAT.
>> I ADORE THE MAN.

45
00:02:25,384 --> 00:02:28,252
LOOK AT THIS.
>> DO YOU HAVE ANY OF THESE?

46
00:02:28,252 --> 00:02:29,736
>> CAN I NIBBLE OFF YOURS?

47
00:02:29,736 --> 00:02:33,346
>> PIGS IN BLANKETS ARE GOOD.
>> UH-HUH, SURE ARE.

48
00:02:34,206 --> 00:02:36,109
>> YOU KNOW, HE ONCE DOXED ME?

49
00:02:36,109 --> 00:02:38,060
>> HE DOXED YOU?
>> NO!

50
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:40,338
>> NO, REALLY?
>> BACK IN 2015.

51
00:02:40,338 --> 00:02:44,070
HE GAVE OUT MY PERSONAL CELL
PHONE NUMBER IN A SPEECH TO ALL
HIS SUPPORTERS.

52
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:48,606
HAD THOUSANDS OF HIS PEOPLE CALL
ME UP TO YELL AT ME.

53
00:02:48,606 --> 00:02:52,220
>> THREATENING MY LIFE.
HAD TO GET A NEW PHONE.

54
00:02:52,284 --> 00:02:54,521
>> MM -- YOU OKAY?
>> OH, GOSH.

55
00:02:54,605 --> 00:02:58,584
>> YOU OKAY?
>> SWITCHED TO VERIZON.

56
00:03:01,006 --> 00:03:06,088
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
I STILL THINK HE'S THE GREATEST
PRESIDENT SINCE REAGAN.

57
00:03:06,088 --> 00:03:08,089
>> OH, HE IS GREATER THAN
REAGAN.

58
00:03:08,089 --> 00:03:10,757
>> OH, HE'S GREATER THAN
LINCOLN.
>> OH, YEAH, RIGHT?

59
00:03:10,757 --> 00:03:13,884
>> SO DARN HANDSOME, IT MAKES ME
JEALOUS.

60
00:03:18,107 --> 00:03:20,842
YOU KNOW TRUMP ONCE SAID I SWEAT
MORE THAN ANYONE HE'S EVER SEEN?

61
00:03:20,842 --> 00:03:23,102
>> OH, REALLY?
>> YEP, YEP.

62
00:03:23,102 --> 00:03:24,995
HE SAID MY SWEAT WAS DECEMBER GUSTING

63
00:03:25,083 --> 00:03:29,455
AND WE NEED SOMEONE IN
THE WHITE HOUSE WHO DOESN'T HAVE
WHATEVER MARCO'S GOT.

64
00:03:29,455 --> 00:03:34,067
BUT THAT'S FINE, YOU KNOW WHAT I
MEAN?
HE DOES WHAT IT TAKES TO WIN.
>> HE DOES.

65
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:37,620
- HE'S TOOL AND HE IS TALL AND I
LIKE HIM.

66
00:03:38,367 --> 00:03:41,187
THESE TATER TOTS ARE NICE.

67
00:03:41,187 --> 00:03:43,918
>> THEY'RE NOT SOGGY OR
ANYTHING.
>> SEASONED.

68
00:03:44,003 --> 00:03:47,984
>> ALL RIGHT, YOU KNOW -- I'VE
NEVER REALLY TALKED ABOUT THIS.

69
00:03:47,984 --> 00:03:50,895
BUT ONE OF THE JANUARY 6th RIOTERS --

70
00:03:50,895 --> 00:03:55,308
I'M SORRY, ONE OF THE
JANUARY 6th TOURISTS.
>> RIGHT.

71
00:03:55,308 --> 00:03:58,927
>> POOPED ON THE FLOOR IN MY
OFFICE.
>> OH, COME ON!

72
00:03:58,927 --> 00:04:00,859
>> LOOK IT UP.
I SWEAR, LOOK IT UP.

73
00:04:00,859 --> 00:04:04,413
SENATOR RICH, "POOP IN OFFICE,"
LOOK IT UP.

74
00:04:04,413 --> 00:04:09,365
TRASHED MY DESK.
TOOK A BIG OLD DEUCE RIGHT ON
THE FLOOR.

75
00:04:09,365 --> 00:04:12,178
LOOK, THAT'S NOT TRUMP'S FAULT,
RIGHT?

76
00:04:12,178 --> 00:04:16,636
TRUMP CALLED THE GUY WHO DID IT
AN INNOCENT PATRIOT.

77
00:04:16,636 --> 00:04:18,760
BUT HE DIDN'T ACTUALLY DO IT.

78
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:22,534
SO WE ALL AGREE, TRUMP IS GREAT,
RIGHT?
>> HE'S WONDERFUL.

79
00:04:22,534 --> 00:04:26,225
>> AS PERFECT A MAN AS THE GOOD
LORD EVER MADE.

80
00:04:27,483 --> 00:04:32,642
>> WHAT I LOVE ABOUT HIM
PERSONALLY IS HE DOESN'T HAVE A
RACIST BONE IN HIS BODY.
I LIKE THAT.

81
00:04:32,642 --> 00:04:34,632
>> REALLY?

82
00:04:34,632 --> 00:04:37,532
DID YOU SEE HIM LAST NIGHT AT
THAT SPEECH IN SOUTH CAROLINA

83
00:04:37,532 --> 00:04:41,840
WHEN HE TOLD THAT CROWD THAT
BLACK PEOPLE LIKE HIM BETTER NOW
BECAUSE HE HAS A MUGSHOT?

84
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,676
>> YEAH, MY MAN GOT STREET CRED!

85
00:04:44,676 --> 00:04:48,737
YOU KNOW.
BUT LOOK, UNDERNEATH IT ALL,
HE'S A GOOD MAN

86
00:04:48,737 --> 00:04:50,870
AND I LOVE HIM,
I DO.

87
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:53,024
>> HEY, TIM.
>> YEAH?

88
00:04:53,024 --> 00:04:56,059
>> WHATEVER HE DID TO YOU, IT'S
NOT YOUR FAULT.

89
00:04:56,059 --> 00:04:59,089
>> BUT NO, NO, HE DIDN'T DO
ANYTHING TO ME.
I'M FINE.

90
00:04:59,089 --> 00:05:03,897
>> I MEAN, ARE YOU REALLY?
REMEMBER, HE'S NOT GOING TO BE
AROUND FOREVER.

91
00:05:03,897 --> 00:05:06,230
WELL, HE MIGHT BE, RIGHT?

92
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:10,213
>> SOMETIMES I THINK HIS ASS IS
GOING TO LIVE A THOUSAND YEARS.

93
00:05:10,322 --> 00:05:13,060
BUT TIM?
HONEY?

94
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:15,658
DON'T LET HIM TURN YOU INTO
SOMEBODY ELSE.

95
00:05:15,658 --> 00:05:18,391
>> GUYS.
I AM A U.S. SENATOR.

96
00:05:18,391 --> 00:05:22,637
AND I WILL NEVER, EVER
COMPROMISE MY INTEGRITY FOR
DONALD TRUMP.

97
00:05:22,837 --> 00:05:26,223
BUT I MIGHT IF HE MADE ME VICE
PRESIDENT, HEY!

98
00:05:27,642 --> 00:05:31,656
>> AND LIVE FROM NEW YORK, IT'S
SATURDAY NIGHT!

99
00:07:38,543 --> 00:07:43,606
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN -- SHANE
GILLIS!

100
00:08:01,785 --> 00:08:06,473
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

101
00:08:06,473 --> 00:08:09,861
IT'S -- YEAH.
I'M HERE.

102
00:08:10,688 --> 00:08:14,668
I -- MOST OF YOU PROBABLY HAVE
NO IDEA WHO I AM.

103
00:08:14,668 --> 00:08:19,107
I WAS ACTUALLY -- I WAS FIRED
FROM THIS SHOW.

104
00:08:19,107 --> 00:08:21,667
AWHILE AGO.
BUT, YOU KNOW.

105
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:23,584
DON'T LOOK THAT UP, PLEASE.

106
00:08:23,584 --> 00:08:25,995
IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHO I AM,
PLEASE DON'T GOOGLE THAT.

107
00:08:25,995 --> 00:08:28,447
IT'S FINE, DON'T EVEN WORRY
ABOUT IT.

108
00:08:28,447 --> 00:08:33,823
I DON'T KNOW.
THIS IS -- I PROBABLY SHOULDN'T
BE UP HERE, HONESTLY.

109
00:08:33,823 --> 00:08:38,473
I SHOULD BE HOME.
I SHOULD BE -- I SHOULD BE A
HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL COACH.

110
00:08:38,473 --> 00:08:40,051
THAT'S WHAT I SHOULD BE.

111
00:08:40,051 --> 00:08:45,228
LIKE, GOD MOLDED ME PERFECTLY TO
BE A HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL COACH.

112
00:08:45,228 --> 00:08:49,196
SLASH NINTH GRADE SEX EDUCATION
TEACHER.

113
00:08:51,242 --> 00:08:54,115
BUT THAT IS WHAT I WANT TO BE.

114
00:08:54,115 --> 00:08:58,165
THAT IS, YOU KNOW -- I CAN FEEL
IT.
IT'S LIKE MY TRUE CALLING.

115
00:08:58,165 --> 00:09:02,163
I CAN FEEL IT, YOU KNOW, GETTING
OLDER, IT'S PASSING ME BY.

116
00:09:02,163 --> 00:09:05,403
YOU KNOW, MY BIOLOGICAL CLOCK IS
TICKING ON THIS STREAM.

117
00:09:05,403 --> 00:09:10,009
YOU KNOW HOW LIKE WHEN A WOMAN'S
BIOLOGICAL CLOCK IS TICKING,

118
00:09:10,009 --> 00:09:13,651
SHE
SEES A BABY IN A STROLLER AND IS
LIKE, "OH MY GOD."

119
00:09:13,651 --> 00:09:16,947
THAT'S HOW I AM IF A SEE A BIG
15-YEAR-OLD.

120
00:09:16,947 --> 00:09:19,096
"OH MY GOD, LOOK AT THE SIZE OF"
THAT KID."

121
00:09:19,096 --> 00:09:24,284
"WITH THE RIGHT COACHING, THAT"
KID COULD BE SOMETHING SPECIAL,
I'M TELLING YOU RIGHT NOW.

122
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:28,373
I COME FROM A LONG LINE OF
COACHES IN MY FAMILY.

123
00:09:28,373 --> 00:09:33,903
MY FATHER'S ACTUALLY A VOLUNTEER
ASSISTANT GIRLS HIGH SCHOOL
BASKETBALL COACH.

124
00:09:33,903 --> 00:09:37,800
HE'S ACTUALLY HERE RIGHT NOW.
YOU GET HIM ON THERE?

125
00:09:38,012 --> 00:09:40,277
THERE HE IS.

126
00:09:41,865 --> 00:09:47,577
THERE'S MY DAD.
THE VOLUNTEER ASSISTANT GIRLS
HIGH SCHOOL BASKETBALL COACH.

127
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,625
I DON'T KNOW, IT'S FUNNY, RIGHT?

128
00:09:50,698 --> 00:09:55,867
YOU DON'T THINK THAT'S FUNNY, TO
BRING MY DAD HERE TO MAKE FUN OF
HIM FOR BEING A GIRLS HIGH
SCHOOL BASKETBALL COACH?

129
00:09:55,867 --> 00:09:59,664
ALL RIGHT.
I THOUGHT IT WAS GREAT.
NEVER MIND.

130
00:09:59,664 --> 00:10:02,313
THOUGHT THAT WAS GOING TO BE A
BIG HIT HERE.

131
00:10:03,203 --> 00:10:06,113
MY MOM'S UP THERE WITH HIM.
MY MOM --

132
00:10:06,113 --> 00:10:08,563
I'M NOT GOING TO MAKE
FUN OF YOU.

133
00:10:08,563 --> 00:10:11,175
MY MOM ASKED ME THIS A LOT.
IT'S KIND OF AN INTENSE
QUESTION.

134
00:10:11,175 --> 00:10:15,406
"WHEN DID WE STOP BEING BEST"
FRIENDS?"

135
00:10:15,406 --> 00:10:17,778
AND SHE'S RIGHT.
WE USED TO BE BEST FRIENDS.

136
00:10:17,778 --> 00:10:19,633
YOU REMEMBER THAT, WHEN YOU WERE
A LITTLE BOY,

137
00:10:19,633 --> 00:10:21,443
YOU LOVED YOUR
MOM, YOU TO THE SHE WAS THE COOLEST --

138
00:10:21,443 --> 00:10:23,484
YOU REMEMBER WHEN YOU
WERE GAY?

139
00:10:23,484 --> 00:10:26,086
YOU REMEMBER WHEN YOU WERE JUST
A GAY LITTLE BOY?

140
00:10:26,181 --> 00:10:30,745
EVERY LITTLE BOY IS JUST THEIR
MOM'S GAY BEST FRIEND, THERE'S
ZER ROW DIFFERENCE.

141
00:10:30,745 --> 00:10:33,829
I WAS GAY FOR MY MOM.
SHE WOULD PICK ME UP FROM SCHOOL,

142
00:10:33,829 --> 00:10:37,605
HOP IN THE VAN, "GIRL,
TELL ME ABOUT YOUR DAY."

143
00:10:37,605 --> 00:10:40,954
I THOUGHT SHE WAS COOL.
I WOULD LISTEN TO HER MUSIC.

144
00:10:42,807 --> 00:10:44,551
LET'S GO, GIRLS!

145
00:10:44,614 --> 00:10:47,046
I WOULD DANCE FOR HER.

146
00:10:47,867 --> 00:10:50,781
SHE'D BE LIKE, "LOOK AT MY
LITTLE DANCER!"

147
00:10:55,085 --> 00:10:59,284
BUT -- MY MOM ASKED ME WHEN WE
STOPPED BEING BEST FRIENDS,

148
00:10:59,284 --> 00:11:01,356
AND
I DON'T HAVE THE HEART TO TELL
HER.

149
00:11:01,356 --> 00:11:05,065
BECAUSE LIKE MOST MEN, I KNOW
EXACTLY WHEN ME AND MY MOM
STOPPED BEING FRIENDS.

150
00:11:05,065 --> 00:11:08,542
IT WAS THE FIRST TIME I WHACKED
OFF.

151
00:11:14,476 --> 00:11:18,451
BEFORE THAT, YOU'RE LIKE,
"WHERE'S MY MOM, I LOVE MY MOM,"
SHE'S TO COOL."

152
00:11:18,451 --> 00:11:21,696
ONE NIGHT, "WHEN'S THAT BITCH
GOING TO LEAVE THE HOUSE?

153
00:11:21,696 --> 00:11:25,828
I HAVE SO MUCH BUSINESS TO
ATTEND TO."

154
00:11:28,604 --> 00:11:32,115
ALL RIGHT, I HOPE I CAN SAY
THOSE WORDS ON TV.

155
00:11:34,439 --> 00:11:39,052
ANYWAY, MY WHOLE FAMILY'S HERE,
SO I'LL TALK ABOUT THEM INSTEAD
OF ANYTHING ELSE.

156
00:11:39,052 --> 00:11:43,606
TALK ABOUT MY FAMILY.
I'LL TELL YOU THIS.
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN TELL BY
LOOKING AT ME,

157
00:11:43,646 --> 00:11:47,359
BUT I DO HAVE
FAMILY MEMBERS WITH DOWN
SYNDROME.

158
00:11:48,408 --> 00:11:51,321
IT ALMOST GOT ME.

159
00:11:51,321 --> 00:11:54,313
I DODGED IT, BUT IT NICKED ME.

160
00:11:56,914 --> 00:11:59,527
IT'S FUNNY.

161
00:11:59,527 --> 00:12:03,047
LOOK, I DON'T HAVE ANY MATERIAL
THAT CAN BE ON TV, ALL RIGHT?

162
00:12:03,047 --> 00:12:05,065
I'M TRYING MY BEST.

163
00:12:05,065 --> 00:12:07,219
ALSO, THIS PLACE IS EXTREMELY
WELL-LIT.

164
00:12:07,219 --> 00:12:10,218
I CAN SEE EVERYONE NOT ENJOYING
IT.

165
00:12:12,686 --> 00:12:16,908
JUST THE MOST NERVOUS I'VE EVER
BEEN.
DON'T CLAP NOW, SHUT UP.

166
00:12:18,045 --> 00:12:22,594
NO, I TALK ABOUT DOWN SYNDROME.
YOU CAN TELL WHO'S NEVER BEEN
AROUND DOWN SYNDROME.

167
00:12:22,594 --> 00:12:25,960
"I HAVE FAMILY MEMBERS WITH DOWN"
SYNDROME."

168
00:12:26,089 --> 00:12:27,869
PEOPLE WHO HAVE NEVER BEEN
AROUND IT ARE ALWAYS LIKE,

169
00:12:27,869 --> 00:12:31,186
"OH."
LIKE IT'S THE END OF THE WORLD.

170
00:12:31,186 --> 00:12:35,827
ARE THEY OKAY?
THEY'RE DOING BETTER THAN
EVERYBODY I KNOW.

171
00:12:35,827 --> 00:12:39,380
THEY'RE THE ONLY ONES HAVING A
GOOD TIME PRETTY CONSISTENTLY.

172
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:41,954
THEY'RE NOT WORRIED ABOUT THE
ELECTION.

173
00:12:41,954 --> 00:12:44,670
THEY'RE HAVING A GOOD TIME.

174
00:12:45,165 --> 00:12:48,716
MY NIECE -- MY NIECE HAS DOWN
SYNDROME.

175
00:12:48,774 --> 00:12:51,156
AND I THOUGHT THAT WAS GOING TO
GET A BIGGER LAUGH.

176
00:12:53,108 --> 00:12:56,069
I THOUGHT WE WERE ALLOWED TO
HAVE FUN HERE.

177
00:12:56,069 --> 00:12:57,772
NO, MY NIECE HAS DOWN SYNDROME.

178
00:12:57,772 --> 00:13:00,996
IT'S A FUNNY THING THAT HAPPENS
WHEN SOMEONE IN YOUR FAMILY HAS
DOWN SYNDROME.

179
00:13:00,996 --> 00:13:04,418
MY SISTER WAS PREGNANT.
EVERYONE WAS VERY, VERY SCARED.

180
00:13:04,501 --> 00:13:09,019
THEY COME INTO YOUR LIFE, YOU
REALIZE THEY'RE THE ONLY GOOD
MEMBER OF YOUR ENTIRE FAMILY.

181
00:13:09,113 --> 00:13:11,761
IT'S CRAZY.
YOUR FAMILY GETS TOO PROUD.

182
00:13:11,853 --> 00:13:15,888
EVERY SINGLE DAY
MY FAMILY'S GROUP TEXT, IT'S
PICTURES OF MY NIECE.

183
00:13:15,888 --> 00:13:21,119
EVERY DAY, SOMEBODY ELSE
COMMENTS "SHE LOOKS EXACTLY LIKE
UNCLE SHANE."

184
00:13:21,119 --> 00:13:24,380
YEAH, I SEE IT A LITTLE.

185
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:28,197
THERE'S NO DENYING SHE LOOKS
LIKE ME WITH BANGS.

186
00:13:28,197 --> 00:13:31,108
JUST HAPPY, JUST --

187
00:13:32,557 --> 00:13:37,140
BUT MY SISTER, MY NIECE'S MOTHER, SHE
DIDN'T KNOW SHE COULD GET
PREGNANT.

188
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:40,618
SHE FOSTERED THEN ADOPTED THREE
BLACK KIDS.

189
00:13:40,618 --> 00:13:43,675
THEN SHE FINALLY GOT PREGNANT.
NOW SHE HAS A KID WITH DOWN
SYNDROME.

190
00:13:43,675 --> 00:13:47,026
HER HUSBAND IS FROM EGYPT, HE'S
AN ARAB GUY.

191
00:13:47,026 --> 00:13:51,752
YOU GO TO THE HOUSE, IT'S LIKE
GETTING INTO THE CRAZIEST UBER
POOL YOU'VE BEEN IN.

192
00:13:51,752 --> 00:13:54,204
IT'S CRAZY.

193
00:13:54,204 --> 00:13:57,807
LIKE, HOW DID YOU GUYS MEET?

194
00:13:59,628 --> 00:14:03,035
BUT THERE'S SOMETHING, I DON'T
KNOW -- MY NIECE, ONE DAY --

195
00:14:03,035 --> 00:14:05,158
I'M
NOT SAYING IT'S SOMETHING I'M
LOOKING FORWARD TO,

196
00:14:05,158 --> 00:14:08,732
BUT I THINK
IT WILL BE A NICE THING FOR THE
WHOLE COUNTRY.

197
00:14:08,732 --> 00:14:11,915
I WOULD SAY WHEN MY NIECE IS
PROBABLY IN FIFTH, SIXTH GRADE,

198
00:14:12,003 --> 00:14:14,852
OUT AT RECESS, SOME WHITE KIDS OUT THERE,

199
00:14:14,947 --> 00:14:17,649
"HEY, YOU'RE NOT
ALLOWED TO PLAY WITH US, YOU'RE
RETARDED."

200
00:14:17,649 --> 00:14:20,891
THEN THREE BLACK KIDS COME
FLYING OUT OF NOWHERE.

201
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:23,886
START WHALING ON THAT CRACKER.

202
00:14:23,886 --> 00:14:28,860
EVERYONE'S GOING TO BE BE LIKE,
OH!
IT'S A NICE MOMENT.

203
00:14:29,879 --> 00:14:32,373
YEAH, I SAID CRACKER.

204
00:14:34,524 --> 00:14:38,515
NO WE -- MY FAMILY AND I, BY
OPENED A COFFEE SHOP IN MY HOMETOWN

205
00:14:38,515 --> 00:14:41,081
FOR PEOPLE WITH DOWN
SYNDROME TO WORK AT.

206
00:14:41,081 --> 00:14:46,356
DON'T CLAP.
I DIDN'T DO IT FOR THE CLAPS.

207
00:14:46,356 --> 00:14:50,074
IT'S GOING EXACTLY HOW YOU WOULD
THINK IT WOULD GO.

208
00:14:50,074 --> 00:14:53,275
IT'S DOING WELL.
LINE AROUND THE CORNER EVERY
DAY.

209
00:14:53,338 --> 00:14:57,397
NOT BECAUSE THERE'S A TON OF
PEOPLE GOING, BUT SERVICE IS --

210
00:14:59,928 --> 00:15:04,426
EVERYONE'S GETTING APPLE JUICE.
WE DON'T KNOW HOW TO FIX THAT
PROBLEM.

211
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:13,586
THERE'S ONE THING -- THERE'S ONE
THING YOU NOTICE, THOUGH, WHEN
YOU WORK WITH THESE GUYS.

212
00:15:13,586 --> 00:15:17,043
IT'S FUNNY.
LITERALLY THERE'S ZERO
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN US AND THEM.

213
00:15:17,043 --> 00:15:19,320
ESPECIALLY AT WORK.
THERE'S NO DIFFERENCE.

214
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:22,198
EVERY DAY THESE DUDES SHOW UP TO
WORK JUST --

215
00:15:23,770 --> 00:15:25,472
YOU'RE LIKE, "WHAT'S YOUR
PROBLEM, DUDE?"

216
00:15:25,472 --> 00:15:28,148
I HATE THIS JOB.

217
00:15:28,148 --> 00:15:31,658
ALL RIGHT, HEY.

TONIGHT.

218

00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:07,498
VACATION?

223
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:08,733
>> CAN'T WE SKIP ONE SUNDAY?

224
00:16:08,735 --> 00:16:10,268
>> HEY.

225
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:10,968
WE'RE CATHOLIC, OKAY?

226
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:11,736
I DON'T CARE WHERE WE ARE ON

227
00:16:11,738 --> 00:16:13,971
SUNDAYS, WE GO TO CHURCH.

228
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:17,608

00:23:33,529 --> 00:23:35,062
WHICH MEANS I HAVE TO MOVE ON TO

468
00:23:35,064 --> 00:23:37,398
MY SECOND CHOICE, CARLEY.

469
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:39,800
WILL YOU GO OUT WITH ME?

470
00:23:39,802 --> 00:23:41,936
>> DON'T LOVE THAT YOU CALLED ME

471
00:23:41,938 --> 00:23:43,237
YOUR SECOND CHOICE, BUT SURE.

472
00:23:43,239 --> 00:23:44,772
>> SEE, THIS IS INTERESTING.

473
00:23:44,774 --> 00:23:45,506
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO GO OUT

474
00:23:45,508 --> 00:23:47,675
WITH CARLEY.

475
00:23:47,677 --> 00:23:48,442
SO CAN I TAKE THAT YES, BANK IT,

476
00:23:48,444 --> 00:23:49,610
AND USE IT ON LAUREL?

477
00:23:51,047 --> 00:23:52,313
>> THERE'S NO BANKING IT.

478
00:23:52,315 --> 00:23:53,814
IT'S NOT A GAME SHOW.

479
00:23:53,816 --> 00:23:55,049
>> EXCUSE ME.

480
00:23:55,051 --> 00:23:57,318
I HAVE A QUERY.

481
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:59,320
>> OKAY, ERIC, WHAT IS IT?

482
00:23:59,322 --> 00:24:02,756
>> ARE WE ALLOWED TO ASK WOMEN

483
00:24:02,758 --> 00:24:03,324
IF THEY ARE TICKLISH?

484
00:24:03,926 --> 00:24:04,925
>> NO.

485
00:24:04,927 --> 00:24:05,693
>> OH, SO YOU SAID I CAN JUST GO

486
00:24:05,695 --> 00:24:06,694
AHEAD AND TRY?

487
00:24:06,696 --> 00:24:08,195
TICKLE, TICKLE, TICKLE, TICKLE!

488
00:24:08,197 --> 00:24:09,196
>> ERIC, CUT YOUR NAILS.

489
00:24:09,198 --> 00:24:11,198
>> NO!

490
00:24:11,701 --> 00:24:13,167
>> ANOTHER QUESTION.

491
00:24:13,169 --> 00:24:13,934
SO WE ALL KNOW CLARK IS GAY,

492
00:24:13,936 --> 00:24:16,670
RIGHT?

493
00:24:16,672 --> 00:24:21,375
>> NO, ONLY TOLD YOU.

494
00:24:21,377 --> 00:24:23,878
>> NOW THAT WE ALL KNOW CLARK IS

495
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:24,411
GAY --

496
00:24:24,814 --> 00:24:25,946
WHICH I'M PERSONALLY FINE WITH.

497
00:24:25,948 --> 00:24:26,947
BUT SINCE CLARK IS NEVER GOING

498
00:24:26,949 --> 00:24:29,683
TO ASK A WOMAN OUT DUE TO HIS

499
00:24:29,685 --> 00:24:30,317
CONDITION --

500
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,619
DOES THAT MEAN I CAN BUY CLARK'S

501
00:24:31,621 --> 00:24:32,686
ASKS?

502
00:24:32,688 --> 00:24:33,320
>> SURE, 20 BUCKS A POP.

503
00:24:33,322 --> 00:24:37,258
>> GREAT.

504
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:38,425
HERE'S -- IT'S LIKE $1,500.

505
00:24:38,427 --> 00:24:39,159
>> WHY DO YOU HAVE SO MUCH CASH

506
00:24:39,161 --> 00:24:40,427
ON YOU?

507
00:24:40,429 --> 00:24:41,195
>> I GO TO THE STRIP CLUB AT

508
00:24:41,197 --> 00:24:42,129
LUNCH.

509
00:24:43,432 --> 00:24:45,799
>> THAT'S WHERE I KNOW YOU FROM.

510
00:24:46,569 --> 00:24:50,804
>> YOU GUYS WORK TOGETHER.

511
00:24:50,806 --> 00:24:52,306
>> LAUREL, I LOVE YOU, I THINK

512
00:24:52,308 --> 00:24:53,073
YOU'RE SMOKING HOT, WOULD YOU GO

513
00:24:53,075 --> 00:24:54,275
OUT WITH ME?

514
00:24:54,277 --> 00:24:58,178
>> STILL, NO.

515
00:24:58,180 --> 00:24:59,446
>> BACK TO SILVER.

516
00:24:59,448 --> 00:25:00,681
CARLEY.

517
00:25:00,683 --> 00:25:01,382
>> I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M SAYING

518
00:25:01,384 --> 00:25:03,951
THIS, BUT YES.

519
00:25:03,953 --> 00:25:04,685
>> SEE, THAT'S WHAT I DON'T LIKE

520
00:25:04,687 --> 00:25:07,655
ABOUT YOU.

521
00:25:07,657 --> 00:25:08,222
YOU WANT IT TOO MUCH.

522
00:25:08,925 --> 00:25:10,691
OKAY.

523
00:25:10,693 --> 00:25:13,694
I'M JUST GOING TO BANK CARLEY'S

524
00:25:13,696 --> 00:25:16,063
YES, IS THAT COOL WITH

525
00:25:16,065 --> 00:25:16,430
EVERYBODY?

526
00:25:16,432 --> 00:25:16,797
>> YEAH.

527
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:17,298
>> WORKS FOR ME.

528
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:18,933
>> NO.

529
00:25:18,935 --> 00:25:21,802
NO BANKING YESES.

530
00:25:21,804 --> 00:25:22,336
>> WE HAVE A QUERY.

531
00:25:22,338 --> 00:25:23,037
>> WHY ARE YOU ALL USING THE

532
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:23,804
WORD "QUERY"?

533
00:25:27,310 --> 00:25:28,842
>> ME AND ROBERT HAVE BEEN

534
00:25:28,844 --> 00:25:29,543
SECRETLY HOOKING UP FOR FIVE

535
00:25:29,545 --> 00:25:30,578
MONTHS.

536
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:31,345
IS IT BAD THAT I'M HIS DIRECT

537
00:25:31,347 --> 00:25:33,314
SUPERIOR?

538
00:25:33,316 --> 00:25:36,150
>> YES, THAT'S OBVIOUSLY BAD.

539
00:25:36,719 --> 00:25:37,451
>> UH-HUH, DOES IT HELP THAT I'M

540
00:25:37,453 --> 00:25:39,053
JUST DOING IT TO GET A RAISE?

541
00:25:39,822 --> 00:25:43,557
>> THAT DOES NOT HELP, NO.

542
00:25:43,559 --> 00:25:45,459
>> OKAY, WE'RE JUST GOING TO GO

543
00:25:45,461 --> 00:25:46,126
AHEAD AND WRAP THIS UP.

544
00:25:46,128 --> 00:25:46,460
>> WAIT.

545
00:25:46,462 --> 00:25:48,696
CAN I SAY SOMETHING?

546
00:25:48,698 --> 00:25:49,430
I LEARNED SOMETHING IMPORTANT

547
00:25:49,432 --> 00:25:50,965
TODAY.

548
00:25:50,967 --> 00:25:52,700
AN OFFICE IS A SACRED PLACE.

549
00:25:52,702 --> 00:25:53,434
AND OFFICE RELATIONSHIPS ARE

550
00:25:53,436 --> 00:25:55,436
TOUGH.

551
00:25:55,438 --> 00:25:56,203
BUT YOU CAN ONLY ASK SOMEONE OUT

552
00:25:56,205 --> 00:25:57,171
ONCE.

553
00:25:57,173 --> 00:26:00,441
IF THEY SAY NO, THAT'S IT.

554
00:26:00,443 --> 00:26:01,976
>> THAT'S LITERALLY THE ONLY

555
00:26:01,978 --> 00:26:02,910
THING WE'VE COVERED TODAY.

556
00:26:05,948 --> 00:26:06,680
>> HERE'S SOMETHING YOU DIDN'T

557
00:26:06,682 --> 00:26:09,283
COVER.

558
00:26:09,285 --> 00:26:11,018
YOU CAN BANK YESES, AND THEY

559
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:11,585
ROLL OVER EVERY YEAR.

560
00:26:12,688 --> 00:26:13,387
>> AND OVER TIME, THEY ACCRUE

561
00:26:13,389 --> 00:26:15,689
INTEREST.

562
00:26:15,691 --> 00:26:17,458
>> AND YOU CAN TRADE IN YOUR

563
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:20,928
CHRISTMAS BONUS FOR 20 NEW ASKS.

564
00:26:20,930 --> 00:26:25,866
>> AND BOOTY KHAKIS ARE OKAY.

565
00:26:26,569 --> 00:26:27,101
>> NO, THEY ARE NOT.

566
00:26:27,103 --> 00:26:28,002
>> THAT WAS NEVER OKAY.

567
00:26:28,004 --> 00:26:29,203
>> NEVER.

568
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:31,269
>>> 30-YEAR-OLD GORDON DWYER

569
00:26:31,269 --> 00:26:34,284
JUST COULDN'T CATCH A BREAK.
NOT AT WORK.

570
00:26:34,284 --> 00:26:35,508
>> DWYER!

571
00:26:36,206 --> 00:26:39,139
>> NOT IN LOVE.
*ZERO*

572
00:26:39,705 --> 00:26:42,490
AND ESPECIALLY NOT ON THE COURT.

573
00:26:42,490 --> 00:26:44,403
>> GORDON FOR THREE!

574
00:26:46,122 --> 00:26:48,287
>> NICE SHOT, IDIOT.

575
00:26:48,287 --> 00:26:50,859
>> WHY AM I SUCH A LOSER?

576
00:26:51,526 --> 00:26:54,566
>> BUT THAT'S ALL ABOUT TO
CHANGE.

577
00:26:54,566 --> 00:26:57,320
>> GORDON, THOUGHT YOU COULD USE
THESE.

578
00:26:57,320 --> 00:27:00,536
DONALD J. TRUMP?

579
00:27:03,439 --> 00:27:05,772
TRUMP "NEVER SURRENDER"
SNEAKERS?

580
00:27:05,772 --> 00:27:07,399
AWESOME!

581
00:27:07,399 --> 00:27:08,524
I'M OPEN.

582
00:27:08,524 --> 00:27:13,094
>> AND GORDON DWYER'S ABOUT TO
FIND OUT THAT WINNING --

583
00:27:13,273 --> 00:27:15,939
>> COME ON, MAN, HOW'D YOU MISS
THAT?

584
00:27:15,939 --> 00:27:18,519
>> IS A STATE OF MIND.

585
00:27:18,519 --> 00:27:22,322
>> I DIDN'T MISS.
IT WENT IN.

586
00:27:23,746 --> 00:27:24,972
>> OH.
ALL RIGHT.

587
00:27:24,972 --> 00:27:29,088
>> FROM NEWSMAX STUDIOS AND THE
WRITER OF "LIKE MIKE"

588
00:27:29,088 --> 00:27:33,128
COMES
ANOTHER MAGICAL SNEAKER MOVIE
FOR WHITE PEOPLE.

589
00:27:33,128 --> 00:27:38,115
>> SO YOU'RE SAYING THESE TRUMP
SHOES MADE YOU GOOD AT
BASKETBALL?

590
00:27:38,115 --> 00:27:41,209
>> NO.
THEY GAVE ME THE POWER TO SAY
I'M GOOD AT BASKETBALL.

591
00:27:41,209 --> 00:27:44,043
THEN DOUBLE DOWN ON THAT UNTIL
PEOPLE ACTUALLY START TO BELIEVE
IT.

592
00:27:44,043 --> 00:27:46,519
>> NOW HE GETS WHATEVER HE
WANTS.

593
00:27:46,519 --> 00:27:49,938
>> MR. MITCHELL.
EVERYBODY'S SAYING I SHOULD HAVE
YOUR OFFICE

594
00:27:49,938 --> 00:27:52,760
BECAUSE MY CUBICLE'S
A DISASTER RIGHT NOW.

595
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:55,936
>> CAN I HAVE A MINUTE TO GATHER
MY THINGS?
>> BYE-BYE.

596
00:27:55,936 --> 00:27:57,950
>> HE GETS WHOEVER HE WANTS.

597
00:27:57,950 --> 00:28:01,180
>> WOW.
THAT WAS THE MOST FANTASTIC
LOVE-MAKING YOU'VE EVER HAD.

598
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:02,826
>> NOT REALLY, IT ONLY LASTED --

599
00:28:02,826 --> 00:28:05,179
>> TWO HOURS, THAT WAS A
TWO-HOUR LOVE SESSION,

600
00:28:05,179 --> 00:28:07,607
YOU HAD A
BIG "O," YOU HAD A VERY BIG "O"
THERE.

601
00:28:07,607 --> 00:28:09,371
>> I DID?

602
00:28:09,456 --> 00:28:13,765
WANT TO GO AGAIN?
>> I'D LOVE TO BUT YOU'RE TOO
TIRED.

603
00:28:14,489 --> 00:28:17,903
>> HE IS WHATEVER HE SAYS HE IS.

604
00:28:17,903 --> 00:28:21,428
>> EXCUSE ME, EXCUSE ME.
IT'S 170.

605
00:28:22,252 --> 00:28:26,178
>> NOW HE'S A BRAND-NEW MAN.

606
00:28:29,334 --> 00:28:31,519
AND PEOPLE ARE NOTICING.

607
00:28:31,519 --> 00:28:33,700
>> NICE SHOES.

608
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:38,077
BUT YOU KNOW, IN MANY WAYS, THE
REAL MAGIC HAS BEEN

609
00:28:38,077 --> 00:28:41,779
INSIDE OF
YOU ALL ALONG.

610
00:28:45,227 --> 00:28:47,904
>> WRONG.
IT COMES FROM THE SHOES,

611
00:28:47,904 --> 00:28:49,839
AND
YOU'RE COMING OFF AS VERY STUPID,

612
00:28:49,839 --> 00:28:52,984
AND FRANKLY, QUITE RUDE,

IN TERMS OF BASKETBALL MOVIE
PASTICHE,

615
00:28:59,155 --> 00:29:01,536
AND WITH REGARD TO
SHOES I THINK WE'VE DONE A
WONDERFUL --

616
00:29:01,536 --> 00:29:04,061
>> WHITE MEN CAN TRUMP.

617
00:29:04,061 --> 00:29:07,195
>> OH, YOU GOT NEW SHOES TOO?

618
00:29:08,112 --> 00:29:10,895

I'M ROB LOWE, AND WELCOME TO

THE FLOOR.

629

BABY IN THE FREEZER."

970
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:45,808
EVEN DONALD TRUMP THINKS THIS
DECISION GOES TOO FAR.

971
00:40:45,808 --> 00:40:48,992
HE CAME OUT STRONGLY IN FAVOR OF
IVF, SAYING THIS.

972

>> I STRONGLY SUPPORT THE
AVAILABILITY OF IVF FOR COUPLES

WHO ARE TRYING TO HAVE A
PRECIOUS LITTLE BEAUTIFUL BABY.

974
00:41:00,377 --> 00:41:04,410
>> YEAH.
I MEAN, HE HAD ME RIGHT UNTIL
THE END WHEN HE SAID "LITTLE BABY"

975
00:41:04,410 --> 00:41:06,333
 LIKE HE WAS
RUMPELSTILTSKIN.

976
00:41:06,333 --> 00:41:10,279
"I MUST HAVE THEIR BEAUTIFUL,"
LITTLE, DELICIOUS BABIES."

977
00:41:10,279 --> 00:41:12,586
TRUMP'S ALSO LIKE RUMPELSTILTSKIN

978
00:41:12,586 --> 00:41:16,435

CLEARLY WOVE HIS OWN HAIR OUT OF
STRAW.

>> DONALD TRUMP ANNOUNCED HE IS
SELLING LIMITED-EDITION GOLD
SNEAKERS FOR $400.

TRIPPING AND FALLING ON
THE STAIRS AGAIN 

986
00:41:48,232 --> 00:41:50,367
AND INSTEAD DID
A FORWARD ROLL

987

1005
00:42:30,999 --> 00:42:31,731
>> NO, COLIN.

1006
00:42:31,733 --> 00:42:32,966
BUT BASED ON MY ACCENT AND SIZE,

1007
00:42:32,968 --> 00:42:35,768
I'M GOING TO GUESS SOFIA VERGARA

1008

1010
00:42:39,107 --> 00:42:40,106
WELL, I HAVE TO ASK.

1011
00:42:40,108 --> 00:42:41,140
AS AN EMBRYO, DO YOU FEEL LIKE

1012
00:42:41,142 --> 00:42:42,609
YOU'RE A FULL HUMAN LIFE?

1013
00:42:42,611 --> 00:42:43,610
>> DOES THIS LOOK LIKE A LIFE TO

1014

I DON'T GOT A BRAIN, I DON'T GOT

1020
00:42:51,987 --> 00:42:52,318
A HEART.

1021
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:54,487
I'M LIKE TOM SANDOVAL.

1022
00:42:56,224 --> 00:42:56,889
>> SO YOU WATCH "VANDERPUMP

1024
00:42:59,194 --> 00:43:02,128
>> OF COURSE NOT.

1025
00:43:02,130 --> 00:43:04,797
I DON'T EVEN HAVE EYES.

1026
00:43:04,799 --> 00:43:07,133
EVEN WITHOUT EYES I CAN SEE

1027
00:43:07,135 --> 00:43:07,734
TOM'S A PURE NARCISSIST.

1028
00:43:11,740 --> 00:43:13,106
I'M JUST HAPPY TO BE OUT THE

1029
00:43:13,108 --> 00:43:14,374
FREEZER, COLIN.

1030

THE FREEZER'S LIKE PRISON.

1031
00:43:15,110 --> 00:43:15,708
NO NAMES, ONLY NUMBERS.

1032
00:43:15,710 --> 00:43:16,376
ONCE I SAW THEM PUT MY BEST

>> A WOMB.

1037
00:43:21,850 --> 00:43:23,349
NINE MONTHS THEY HAD HIM IN

1038
00:43:23,351 --> 00:43:26,052
THERE EATING OUT OF A TUBE.

1039
00:43:26,054 --> 00:43:27,186
THEN THEY TRANSFERRED HIM TO

1040
00:43:27,188 --> 00:43:27,720
REAL JAIL, ALABAMA.

1041
00:43:31,626 --> 00:43:32,458
GETS ME UPSET JUST THINKING

1042

00:43:36,965 --> 00:43:38,898
YOUR MOUTH?

1046
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:41,100
>> I DON'T HAVE A MOUTH, COLIN.

1047
00:43:41,102 --> 00:43:41,768
BUT YES, I'VE BEEN DOING A

1048
00:43:41,770 --> 00:43:42,335
COUPLE OF ZINS A DAY.

1049
00:43:42,337 --> 00:43:43,102
MAYBE 20 MAX.

1050
00:43:43,104 --> 00:43:44,070
ALL THE EMBRYOS ARE DOING IT.

1051
00:43:44,072 --> 00:43:45,338
SURE, IT MIGHT BE BAD FOR ME.

1052
00:43:45,340 --> 00:43:47,607
BUT WHEN THAT ZIN HITS --

1053
00:43:47,609 --> 00:43:49,175
>> YOU FEEL LIKE A GOD, YEAH.

1054
00:43:49,978 --> 00:43:50,710
>> YEAH.

1055

LOOK, COLIN.

1056
00:43:51,479 --> 00:43:52,145

1058
00:43:52,847 --> 00:43:53,713
FAST.

1059
00:43:53,715 --> 00:43:55,481
WHY DO I HAVE TO BE A HUMAN?

1060
00:43:55,483 --> 00:43:56,215
CAN'T I JUST BE AN EMBRYO FOR A

1061

SUCH AN INNOVATOR.

1183
00:48:30,091 --> 00:48:30,856
TERRIBLE WHAT HAPPENED TO HER.

1184

1193
00:48:46,674 --> 00:48:48,975
POOR THING.

1194
00:48:48,977 --> 00:48:49,709
THERE WERE ONLY 13 STAR STARS ON

1195
00:48:49,711 --> 00:48:50,476
THE FLAG BECAUSE THAT'S AS HIGH

1196

>> OF COURSE I DO.

1202

THERE IS NOTHING MORE BEAUTIFUL

1203
00:49:01,222 --> 00:49:02,989

1204
00:49:02,991 --> 00:49:04,390
EXCEPT THE ASS OF A MAN.

1205
00:49:06,761 --> 00:49:10,129
>> RIGHT.

1206
00:49:10,131 --> 00:49:10,730

FLORENCE, LOOK AT THAT HAT.

1211
00:49:17,839 --> 00:49:20,706
I DON'T NEED TO TELL YOU THIS,

1212
00:49:20,708 --> 00:49:23,843
BUT SHE'S THE REASON EVERY NURSE

1213
00:49:23,845 --> 00:49:24,243
IS A WOMAN.

1214
00:49:24,245 --> 00:49:25,011
>> NOT ALL NURSES ARE WOMEN.

1215
00:49:25,013 --> 00:49:25,845
>> THEY SHOULD BE.

1216
00:49:25,847 --> 00:49:28,381
>> TRUMAN, YOU'RE JUST LYING.

1217

THEY'RE FULL OF LEAST, AND

1224
00:49:42,864 --> 00:49:43,496
THEY'RE TECHNICALLY ALIVE.

1225
00:49:50,338 --> 00:49:52,004
YOU KNOW WHAT, COLIN, I LOVE

1226
00:49:52,006 --> 00:49:54,607
WOMEN BUT THEY DON'T LOVE ME

00:49:56,411 --> 00:49:58,477
MEAN THINGS TO THEM.

1230
00:49:58,479 --> 00:49:59,211
>> THEY'RE THE ONES WHO ARE MEAN

1231
00:49:59,213 --> 00:50:00,780
TO ME.

1232
00:50:00,782 --> 00:50:01,514
ONE WOMAN CALLED ME A NASTY HOMO

1233
00:50:01,516 --> 00:50:01,981
THE OTHER DAY.

1234
00:50:01,983 --> 00:50:03,015
>> OH MY GOD, THAT'S AWFUL.

1235

HUSBAND.

1238
00:50:09,557 --> 00:50:10,289
>> OKAY -- WELL, THERE YOU GO.

00:50:10,291 --> 00:50:11,991
I MEAN --

1240

COLIN.

1242

ELEANOR ROOSEVELT.

1243
00:50:16,497 --> 00:50:17,496
SHE PUSHED FDR DOWN THE STAIRS.

1244
00:50:18,499 --> 00:50:19,231
KICKED HIM WITH HER BIG LESBIAN

FEET.

1246

>> AND WHAT ABOUT SACAGAWEA?

1248

SHE LIED TO THOSE GUYS.

1249
00:50:25,873 --> 00:50:27,106
SHE KNEW WHERE THE GOLD WAS.

1250

1251

YOU'RE JUST MAKING UP THESE

1252

DO YOU LIKE WOMEN AT ALL?

1254
00:50:34,382 --> 00:50:35,381
>> OH, PLEASE, COLIN.

1255

NO ONE LOVES WOMEN LIKE A GAY

1256
00:50:36,117 --> 00:50:37,750
MAN -- WHO HATES WOMEN.
