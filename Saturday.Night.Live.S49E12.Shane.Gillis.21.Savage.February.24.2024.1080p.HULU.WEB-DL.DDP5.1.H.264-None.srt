1
00:00:04,029 --> 00:00:07,107
>>> SENATOR RICH, MIND IF I JOIN
YOU?

2
00:00:11,833 --> 00:00:15,871
>> SENATOR RUBIO, OF COURSE,
HAVE A SEAT.
>> THANK YOU.

3
00:00:15,871 --> 00:00:18,925
>> DECEMBER WE BETTER TOAST TO
PRESIDENT TRUMP.

4
00:00:18,925 --> 00:00:21,982
THAT WAS A BIG VICTORY TONIGHT.
21 POINTS.

5
00:00:21,982 --> 00:00:24,993
>> YES, SIR.
WELL, THERE WAS NEVER ANY DOUBT.

6
00:00:25,076 --> 00:00:27,470
I GUESS TRUMP OWNS THE
REPUBLICAN PARTY NOW.

7
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:29,823
>> YEAH.
I GOT TO ADMIT, THOUGH.

8
00:00:29,823 --> 00:00:33,617
SOMETIMES I DO NOT KNOW WHAT MY
PARTY IS DOING.

9
00:00:33,617 --> 00:00:37,950
I MEAN, I'VE BEEN PUSHING FOR
UKRAINE FUNDING FOR THE PAST SIX
MONTHS.

10
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:40,527
IT'S ESSENTIAL TO AMERICAN
SECURITY.

11
00:00:40,527 --> 00:00:43,514
AND TRUMP JUST KILLED IT WITH
ONE PHONE CALL.

12
00:00:43,514 --> 00:00:47,212
THE MAN DOESN'T CARE ABOUT THIS
COUNTRY ONE IOTA.

13
00:00:47,212 --> 00:00:49,420
SOMETIMES I THINK HE'S DOWNRIGHT
DANGEROUS.

14
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:53,541
>> HM.
AND YOU JUST ENDORSED HIM,
RIGHT?
>> YEAH, BIG-TIME,

15
00:00:53,625 --> 00:00:55,278
HE'S GREAT.
>> SO GREAT.

16
00:00:55,278 --> 00:00:58,598
>> HE IS INCREDIBLE.
>> UH-HUH.

17
00:00:59,488 --> 00:01:04,474
>> NOW, TRUMP GAVE YOU THE NAME
LITTLE MARCO.
RIGHT?

18
00:01:04,674 --> 00:01:07,331
>> UH, YEAH, YEAH.
I'VE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO SHAKE
IT.

19
00:01:07,331 --> 00:01:11,650
PEOPLE STILL YELL IT AT ME IN
AIRPORTS.
HE KIND OF MADE MY LIFE HELL.

20
00:01:12,049 --> 00:01:15,099
>> AND YOU ENDORSED HIM, RIGHT?
>> ABSOLUTELY.

21
00:01:15,099 --> 00:01:17,375
>> BIG-TIME.
THAT GUY'S JUST THE BEST.

22
00:01:17,375 --> 00:01:20,376
THE BEST.
HE'S AMAZING, AMAZING.

23
00:01:20,376 --> 00:01:22,793
>> SOUTH CAROLINA IN THE HOUSE.

24
00:01:22,793 --> 00:01:26,959
>> WELL, WELL.
SENATOR GRAHAM.
SENATOR SCOTT.

25
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:29,574
GET IN HERE, JOIN US, GET YOUR
BUTTS IN HERE.

26
00:01:29,574 --> 00:01:31,857
>> WITH PLEASURE, WITH PLEASURE.

27
00:01:32,872 --> 00:01:35,198
>> Y'ALL TALKING ABOUT TRUMP?
>> UH-HUH.

28
00:01:35,198 --> 00:01:37,475
YOU KNOW WE ARE.
YES, SIR.

29
00:01:37,475 --> 00:01:41,576
>> OH, HEY TIM, I SAW YOU WITH
TRUMP ON THAT LAURA INGRAHAM
TOWN HALL LAST WEEK.

30
00:01:41,679 --> 00:01:44,266
KIND OF ROUGH, RIGHT?
YOU WERE SITTING RIGHT THERE,

31
00:01:44,266 --> 00:01:47,380
HE
SAID TO THE CROWD THAT YOU'VE
BEEN A MUCH BETTER CANDIDATE FOR HIM

32
00:01:47,445 --> 00:01:49,497
THAN YOU EVER WERE FOR
YOURSELF.

33
00:01:49,497 --> 00:01:52,440
>> YEAH, HE'S SO FUNNY.
>> HE'S HILARIOUS.

34
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:55,018
>> SUPER FUNNY.

35
00:01:55,018 --> 00:01:58,168
>> A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO HE MADE
YOU STAND IN FRONT OF A CROWD

36
00:01:58,168 --> 00:01:59,857
ASK SAY YOU HATE NIKKI HALEY.

37
00:01:59,857 --> 00:02:02,071
ISN'T SHE THE ONE WHO APPOINTED
YOU IN THE SENATE?

38
00:02:02,071 --> 00:02:05,109
>> NO, NO, HE DIDN'T MAKE ME SAY
THAT I HATE HER.

39
00:02:05,109 --> 00:02:06,994
HE SAID, "YOU MUST REALLY HATE
HER."

40
00:02:06,994 --> 00:02:08,869
BUT Y'ALL SAW WHAT I DID.

41
00:02:08,869 --> 00:02:12,964
I STEPPED RIGHT UP TO THE MIC
AND I SAID, "NO, I JUST LOVE
YOU."

42
00:02:12,964 --> 00:02:17,263
>> WOW.
YOU SHOWED HIM.
VERY COOL.

43
00:02:18,664 --> 00:02:21,535
>> YEAH, I DO LOVE HIM, THOUGH,
HE'S GREAT, HE'S GREAT.

44
00:02:21,535 --> 00:02:24,994
>> HE IS SO GREAT.
>> I ADORE THE MAN.

45
00:02:25,384 --> 00:02:28,252
LOOK AT THIS.
>> DO YOU HAVE ANY OF THESE?

46
00:02:28,252 --> 00:02:29,736
>> CAN I NIBBLE OFF YOURS?

47
00:02:29,736 --> 00:02:33,346
>> PIGS IN BLANKETS ARE GOOD.
>> UH-HUH, SURE ARE.

48
00:02:34,206 --> 00:02:36,109
>> YOU KNOW, HE ONCE DOXED ME?

49
00:02:36,109 --> 00:02:38,060
>> HE DOXED YOU?
>> NO!

50
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:40,338
>> NO, REALLY?
>> BACK IN 2015.

51
00:02:40,338 --> 00:02:44,070
HE GAVE OUT MY PERSONAL CELL
PHONE NUMBER IN A SPEECH TO ALL
HIS SUPPORTERS.

52
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:48,606
HAD THOUSANDS OF HIS PEOPLE CALL
ME UP TO YELL AT ME.

53
00:02:48,606 --> 00:02:52,220
>> THREATENING MY LIFE.
HAD TO GET A NEW PHONE.

54
00:02:52,284 --> 00:02:54,521
>> MM -- YOU OKAY?
>> OH, GOSH.

55
00:02:54,605 --> 00:02:58,584
>> YOU OKAY?
>> SWITCHED TO VERIZON.

56
00:03:01,006 --> 00:03:06,088
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
I STILL THINK HE'S THE GREATEST
PRESIDENT SINCE REAGAN.

57
00:03:06,088 --> 00:03:08,089
>> OH, HE IS GREATER THAN
REAGAN.

58
00:03:08,089 --> 00:03:10,757
>> OH, HE'S GREATER THAN
LINCOLN.
>> OH, YEAH, RIGHT?

59
00:03:10,757 --> 00:03:13,884
>> SO DARN HANDSOME, IT MAKES ME
JEALOUS.

60
00:03:18,107 --> 00:03:20,842
YOU KNOW TRUMP ONCE SAID I SWEAT
MORE THAN ANYONE HE'S EVER SEEN?

61
00:03:20,842 --> 00:03:23,102
>> OH, REALLY?
>> YEP, YEP.

62
00:03:23,102 --> 00:03:24,995
HE SAID MY SWEAT WAS DECEMBER GUSTING 

63
00:03:25,083 --> 00:03:29,455
AND WE NEED SOMEONE IN
THE WHITE HOUSE WHO DOESN'T HAVE
WHATEVER MARCO'S GOT.

64
00:03:29,455 --> 00:03:34,067
BUT THAT'S FINE, YOU KNOW WHAT I
MEAN?
HE DOES WHAT IT TAKES TO WIN.
>> HE DOES.

65
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:37,620
- HE'S TOOL AND HE IS TALL AND I
LIKE HIM.

66
00:03:38,367 --> 00:03:41,187
THESE TATER TOTS ARE NICE.

67
00:03:41,187 --> 00:03:43,918
>> THEY'RE NOT SOGGY OR
ANYTHING.
>> SEASONED.

68
00:03:44,003 --> 00:03:47,984
>> ALL RIGHT, YOU KNOW -- I'VE
NEVER REALLY TALKED ABOUT THIS.

69
00:03:47,984 --> 00:03:50,895
BUT ONE OF THE JANUARY 6th RIOTERS --

70
00:03:50,895 --> 00:03:55,308
 I'M SORRY, ONE OF THE
JANUARY 6th TOURISTS.
>> RIGHT.

71
00:03:55,308 --> 00:03:58,927
>> POOPED ON THE FLOOR IN MY
OFFICE.
>> OH, COME ON!

72
00:03:58,927 --> 00:04:00,859
>> LOOK IT UP.
I SWEAR, LOOK IT UP.

73
00:04:00,859 --> 00:04:04,413
SENATOR RICH, "POOP IN OFFICE,"
LOOK IT UP.

74
00:04:04,413 --> 00:04:09,365
TRASHED MY DESK.
TOOK A BIG OLD DEUCE RIGHT ON
THE FLOOR.

75
00:04:09,365 --> 00:04:12,178
LOOK, THAT'S NOT TRUMP'S FAULT,
RIGHT?

76
00:04:12,178 --> 00:04:16,636
TRUMP CALLED THE GUY WHO DID IT
AN INNOCENT PATRIOT.

77
00:04:16,636 --> 00:04:18,760
BUT HE DIDN'T ACTUALLY DO IT.

78
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:22,534
SO WE ALL AGREE, TRUMP IS GREAT,
RIGHT?
>> HE'S WONDERFUL.

79
00:04:22,534 --> 00:04:26,225
>> AS PERFECT A MAN AS THE GOOD
LORD EVER MADE.

80
00:04:27,483 --> 00:04:32,642
>> WHAT I LOVE ABOUT HIM
PERSONALLY IS HE DOESN'T HAVE A
RACIST BONE IN HIS BODY.
I LIKE THAT.

81
00:04:32,642 --> 00:04:34,632
>> REALLY?

82
00:04:34,632 --> 00:04:37,532
DID YOU SEE HIM LAST NIGHT AT
THAT SPEECH IN SOUTH CAROLINA

83
00:04:37,532 --> 00:04:41,840
WHEN HE TOLD THAT CROWD THAT
BLACK PEOPLE LIKE HIM BETTER NOW
BECAUSE HE HAS A MUGSHOT?

84
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,676
>> YEAH, MY MAN GOT STREET CRED!

85
00:04:44,676 --> 00:04:48,737
YOU KNOW.
BUT LOOK, UNDERNEATH IT ALL,
HE'S A GOOD MAN

86
00:04:48,737 --> 00:04:50,870
 AND I LOVE HIM,
I DO.

87
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:53,024
>> HEY, TIM.
>> YEAH?

88
00:04:53,024 --> 00:04:56,059
>> WHATEVER HE DID TO YOU, IT'S
NOT YOUR FAULT.

89
00:04:56,059 --> 00:04:59,089
>> BUT NO, NO, HE DIDN'T DO
ANYTHING TO ME.
I'M FINE.

90
00:04:59,089 --> 00:05:03,897
>> I MEAN, ARE YOU REALLY?
REMEMBER, HE'S NOT GOING TO BE
AROUND FOREVER.

91
00:05:03,897 --> 00:05:06,230
WELL, HE MIGHT BE, RIGHT?

92
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:10,213
>> SOMETIMES I THINK HIS ASS IS
GOING TO LIVE A THOUSAND YEARS.

93
00:05:10,322 --> 00:05:13,060
BUT TIM?
HONEY?

94
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:15,658
DON'T LET HIM TURN YOU INTO
SOMEBODY ELSE.

95
00:05:15,658 --> 00:05:18,391
>> GUYS.
I AM A U.S. SENATOR.

96
00:05:18,391 --> 00:05:22,637
AND I WILL NEVER, EVER
COMPROMISE MY INTEGRITY FOR
DONALD TRUMP.

97
00:05:22,837 --> 00:05:26,223
BUT I MIGHT IF HE MADE ME VICE
PRESIDENT, HEY!

98
00:05:27,642 --> 00:05:31,656
>> AND LIVE FROM NEW YORK, IT'S
SATURDAY NIGHT!

99
00:07:38,543 --> 00:07:43,606
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN -- SHANE
GILLIS!

100
00:08:01,785 --> 00:08:06,473
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

101
00:08:06,473 --> 00:08:09,861
IT'S -- YEAH.
I'M HERE.

102
00:08:10,688 --> 00:08:19,431
I -- MOST OF YOU PROBABLY HAVE

103
00:08:19,433 --> 00:08:21,967
NO IDEA WHO I AM.

104
00:08:21,969 --> 00:08:24,636
I WAS ACTUALLY -- I WAS FIRED

105
00:08:24,638 --> 00:08:26,104
FROM THIS SHOW.

106
00:08:26,507 --> 00:08:27,739
AWHILE AGO.

107
00:08:27,741 --> 00:08:28,373
BUT, YOU KNOW.

108
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:30,308
DON'T LOOK THAT UP, PLEASE.

109
00:08:30,711 --> 00:08:32,344
IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHO I AM,

110
00:08:32,346 --> 00:08:33,778
PLEASE DON'T GOOGLE THAT.

111
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:36,147
IT'S FINE, DON'T EVEN WORRY

112
00:08:36,149 --> 00:08:36,915
ABOUT IT.

113
00:08:36,917 --> 00:08:37,849
I DON'T KNOW.

114
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:38,650
THIS IS -- I PROBABLY SHOULDN'T

115
00:08:38,652 --> 00:08:40,752
BE UP HERE, HONESTLY.

116
00:08:40,754 --> 00:08:42,153
I SHOULD BE HOME.

117
00:08:42,155 --> 00:08:44,556
I SHOULD BE -- I SHOULD BE A

118
00:08:44,558 --> 00:08:45,490
HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL COACH.

119
00:08:45,893 --> 00:08:47,359
THAT'S WHAT I SHOULD BE.

120
00:08:47,361 --> 00:08:49,895
LIKE, GOD MOLDED ME PERFECTLY TO

121
00:08:49,897 --> 00:08:53,932
BE A HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL COACH.

122
00:08:53,934 --> 00:08:54,699
SLASH NINTH GRADE SEX EDUCATION

123
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:55,033
TEACHER.

124
00:08:59,673 --> 00:09:01,473
BUT THAT IS WHAT I WANT TO BE.

125
00:09:01,475 --> 00:09:02,941
THAT IS, YOU KNOW -- I CAN FEEL

126
00:09:02,943 --> 00:09:03,208

127
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:05,477
IT'S LIKE MY TRUE CALLING.

128
00:09:05,479 --> 00:09:05,844
YOU KNOW.

I CAN FEEL IT, YOU KNOW, GETTING

130
00:09:07,915 --> 00:09:09,514
OLDER, IT'S PASSING ME BY.

131
00:09:09,516 --> 00:09:11,583
YOU KNOW, MY BIOLOGICAL CLOCK IS

132
00:09:11,585 --> 00:09:13,451
TICKING ON THIS STREAM.

133
00:09:13,453 --> 00:09:15,453
YOU KNOW HOW LIKE WHEN A WOMAN'S

134
00:09:15,455 --> 00:09:16,988
BIOLOGICAL CLOCK IS TICKING, SHE

THAT'S HOW I AM IF A SEE A BIG

"WITH THE RIGHT COACHING, THAT"

142
00:09:29,469 --> 00:09:30,702

I'M TELLING YOU RIGHT NOW.

144

YEAH.

152
00:09:44,585 --> 00:09:49,454
THERE HE IS.

153
00:09:49,456 --> 00:09:50,589
THERE'S MY DAD.

154
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:51,856
THE VOLUNTEER ASSISTANT GIRLS

155
00:09:51,858 --> 00:09:52,557
HIGH SCHOOL BASKETBALL COACH.

156
00:09:55,896 --> 00:09:57,729
I DON'T KNOW, IT'S FUNNY, RIGHT?

157
00:09:57,731 --> 00:09:59,431
YOU DON'T THINK THAT'S FUNNY, TO

158
00:09:59,433 --> 00:10:01,166
BRING MY DAD HERE TO MAKE FUN OF

159
00:10:01,168 --> 00:10:02,567
HIM FOR BEING A GIRLS HIGH

160
00:10:02,569 --> 00:10:03,768
SCHOOL BASKETBALL COACH?

161
00:10:04,171 --> 00:10:04,536
ALL RIGHT.

162
00:10:04,538 --> 00:10:05,136
I THOUGHT IT WAS GREAT.

163
00:10:05,138 --> 00:10:05,537
NEVER MIND.

164
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:07,872
THOUGHT THAT WAS GOING TO BE A

165
00:10:07,874 --> 00:10:10,408
BIG HIT HERE.

166
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:12,277
MY MOM'S UP THERE WITH HIM.

167
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:13,678
MY MOM -- I'M NOT GOING TO MAKE

168
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,113
FUN OF YOU.

169
00:10:15,515 --> 00:10:17,449
MY MOM ASKED ME THIS A LOT.

170
00:10:17,451 --> 00:10:19,584
IT'S KIND OF AN INTENSE

171
00:10:19,586 --> 00:10:20,251
QUESTION.

172
00:10:20,253 --> 00:10:22,420
"WHEN DID WE STOP BEING BEST"

173
00:10:22,422 --> 00:10:22,787
FRIENDS?"

174
00:10:22,789 --> 00:10:23,288
AND SHE'S RIGHT.

175
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:24,789
WE USED TO BE BEST FRIENDS.

176
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:25,890
YOU REMEMBER THAT, WHEN YOU WERE

177
00:10:25,892 --> 00:10:28,026
A LITTLE BOY, YOU LOVED YOUR

178
00:10:28,028 --> 00:10:29,494
MOM, YOU TO THE SHE WAS THE

179
00:10:29,496 --> 00:10:31,296
COOLEST -- YOU REMEMBER WHEN YOU

180
00:10:31,298 --> 00:10:32,297
WERE GAY?

181
00:10:32,699 --> 00:10:33,832
YOU REMEMBER WHEN YOU WERE JUST

182
00:10:33,834 --> 00:10:34,966
A GAY LITTLE BOY?

183
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:37,068
EVERY LITTLE BOY IS JUST THEIR

184
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:38,303
MOM'S GAY BEST FRIEND, THERE'S

185
00:10:38,305 --> 00:10:39,037
ZER ROW DIFFERENCE.

186
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:40,271
I WAS GAY FOR MY MOM.

187
00:10:40,273 --> 00:10:41,740
SHE WOULD PICK ME UP FROM

188
00:10:41,742 --> 00:10:43,208
SCHOOL, HOP IN THE VAN, "GIRL,

189
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:44,843
TELL ME ABOUT YOUR DAY."

190
00:10:45,245 --> 00:10:46,011
I THOUGHT SHE WAS COOL.

191
00:10:46,013 --> 00:10:48,580
I WOULD LISTEN TO HER MUSIC.

192
00:10:48,582 --> 00:10:49,180
♪ BAM BAM BAM ♪

193
00:10:49,182 --> 00:10:50,882
LET'S GO, GIRLS!

194
00:10:51,284 --> 00:10:54,953
I WOULD DANCE FOR HER.

195
00:10:54,955 --> 00:10:56,788
SHE'D BE LIKE, "LOOK AT MY

196
00:10:56,790 --> 00:11:00,859
LITTLE DANCER!"

197
00:11:00,861 --> 00:11:05,430
BUT -- MY MOM ASKED ME WHEN WE

198
00:11:05,432 --> 00:11:06,431
STOPPED BEING BEST FRIENDS, AND

199
00:11:06,433 --> 00:11:08,400
I DON'T HAVE THE HEART TO TELL

200
00:11:08,402 --> 00:11:08,667
HER.

201
00:11:08,669 --> 00:11:10,502
BECAUSE LIKE MOST MEN, I KNOW

202
00:11:10,504 --> 00:11:11,836
EXACTLY WHEN ME AND MY MOM

203
00:11:11,838 --> 00:11:12,671
STOPPED BEING FRIENDS.

204
00:11:12,673 --> 00:11:13,405
IT WAS THE FIRST TIME I WHACKED

205
00:11:13,407 --> 00:11:13,672
OFF.

206
00:11:15,942 --> 00:11:21,646
RIGHT?

207
00:11:21,648 --> 00:11:23,415
BEFORE THAT, YOU'RE LIKE,

208
00:11:23,417 --> 00:11:25,216
"WHERE'S MY MOM, I LOVE MY MOM,"

209
00:11:25,218 --> 00:11:26,051
SHE'S TO COOL."

210
00:11:26,053 --> 00:11:29,020
ONE NIGHT, "WHEN'S THAT BITCH

211
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:30,021
GOING TO LEAVE THE HOUSE?

212
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:30,722
I HAVE SO MUCH BUSINESS TO

213
00:11:30,724 --> 00:11:31,156
ATTEND TO."

214
00:11:35,529 --> 00:11:36,861
ALL RIGHT, I HOPE I CAN SAY

215
00:11:36,863 --> 00:11:37,362
THOSE WORDS ON TV.

216
00:11:41,902 --> 00:11:43,301
ANYWAY, MY WHOLE FAMILY'S HERE,

217
00:11:43,303 --> 00:11:44,035
SO I'LL TALK ABOUT THEM INSTEAD

218
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:46,438
OF ANYTHING ELSE.

219
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,405
TALK ABOUT MY FAMILY.

220
00:11:47,407 --> 00:11:48,573
I'LL TELL YOU THIS.

221
00:11:48,575 --> 00:11:49,774
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN TELL BY

222
00:11:49,776 --> 00:11:50,942
LOOKING AT ME, BUT I DO HAVE

223
00:11:50,944 --> 00:11:51,576
FAMILY MEMBERS WITH DOWN

224
00:11:51,578 --> 00:11:54,813
SYNDROME.

225
00:11:55,348 --> 00:11:58,316
IT ALMOST GOT ME.

226
00:11:58,719 --> 00:12:00,118
I DODGED IT, BUT IT NICKED ME.

227
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:03,388
IT NICKED ME.

228
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:06,624
IT'S FUNNY.

229
00:12:06,626 --> 00:12:07,559
LOOK, I DON'T HAVE ANY MATERIAL

230
00:12:07,561 --> 00:12:08,259
THAT CAN BE ON TV, ALL RIGHT?

231
00:12:10,597 --> 00:12:12,197
I'M TRYING MY BEST.

232
00:12:12,199 --> 00:12:14,365
ALSO, THIS PLACE IS EXTREMELY

233
00:12:14,367 --> 00:12:14,733
WELL-LIT.

234
00:12:14,735 --> 00:12:15,500
I CAN SEE EVERYONE NOT ENJOYING

235
00:12:15,502 --> 00:12:15,767
IT.

236
00:12:19,506 --> 00:12:19,871
YOU KNOW.

237
00:12:19,873 --> 00:12:21,573
JUST THE MOST NERVOUS I'VE EVER

238
00:12:21,575 --> 00:12:21,873
BEEN.

239
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:22,474
DON'T CLAP NOW, SHUT UP.

240
00:12:26,346 --> 00:12:28,213
NO, I TALK ABOUT DOWN SYNDROME.

241
00:12:28,215 --> 00:12:30,248
YOU CAN TELL WHO'S NEVER BEEN

242
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:31,716
AROUND DOWN SYNDROME.

243
00:12:31,718 --> 00:12:33,885
"I HAVE FAMILY MEMBERS WITH DOWN"

244
00:12:33,887 --> 00:12:34,252
SYNDROME."

245
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:36,287
PEOPLE WHO HAVE NEVER BEEN

246
00:12:36,289 --> 00:12:38,690
AROUND IT ARE ALWAYS LIKE, "OH."

247
00:12:38,692 --> 00:12:40,425
LIKE IT'S THE END OF THE WORLD.

248
00:12:40,427 --> 00:12:42,026
ARE THEY OKAY?

249
00:12:42,028 --> 00:12:42,861
THEY'RE DOING BETTER THAN

250
00:12:42,863 --> 00:12:43,962
EVERYBODY I KNOW.

251
00:12:43,964 --> 00:12:45,830
THEY'RE THE ONLY ONES HAVING A

252
00:12:45,832 --> 00:12:46,831
GOOD TIME PRETTY CONSISTENTLY.

253
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:47,532
THEY'RE NOT WORRIED ABOUT THE

254
00:12:47,534 --> 00:12:47,899
ELECTION.

255
00:12:49,035 --> 00:12:51,302
THEY'RE HAVING A GOOD TIME.

256
00:12:51,304 --> 00:12:55,106
MY NIECE -- MY NIECE HAS DOWN

257
00:12:55,108 --> 00:12:55,473
SYNDROME.

258
00:12:55,475 --> 00:12:56,241
AND I THOUGHT THAT WAS GOING TO

259
00:12:56,243 --> 00:12:56,775
GET A BIGGER LAUGH.

260
00:13:00,647 --> 00:13:03,081
I THOUGHT WE WERE ALLOWED TO

261
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:04,482
HAVE FUN HERE.

262
00:13:04,484 --> 00:13:06,885
NO, MY NIECE HAS DOWN SYNDROME.

263
00:13:06,887 --> 00:13:08,753
IT'S A FUNNY THING THAT HAPPENS

264
00:13:08,755 --> 00:13:10,989
WHEN SOMEONE IN YOUR FAMILY HAS

265
00:13:10,991 --> 00:13:12,157
DOWN SYNDROME.

266
00:13:12,159 --> 00:13:13,224
MY SISTER WAS PREGNANT.

267
00:13:13,226 --> 00:13:15,293
EVERYONE WAS VERY, VERY SCARED.

268
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:16,528
THEY COME INTO YOUR LIFE, YOU

269
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:17,762
REALIZE THEY'RE THE ONLY GOOD

270
00:13:17,764 --> 00:13:19,030
MEMBER OF YOUR ENTIRE FAMILY.

271
00:13:19,032 --> 00:13:19,531
IT'S CRAZY.

272
00:13:19,533 --> 00:13:21,132
YOUR FAMILY GETS TOO PROUD.

273
00:13:21,134 --> 00:13:24,169
MY FAMILY'S GROUP TEXT, IT'S

274
00:13:24,171 --> 00:13:25,236
PICTURES OF MY NIECE.

275
00:13:25,238 --> 00:13:26,638
EVERY DAY, SOMEBODY ELSE

276
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:29,040
COMMENTS "SHE LOOKS EXACTLY LIKE

277
00:13:29,042 --> 00:13:29,974
UNCLE SHANE."

278
00:13:30,577 --> 00:13:31,843
YEAH, I SEE IT A LITTLE.

279
00:13:31,845 --> 00:13:35,513
THERE'S NO DENYING SHE LOOKS

280
00:13:35,515 --> 00:13:36,247
LIKE ME WITH BANGS.

281
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:41,986
JUST HAPPY, JUST -- BUT MY

282
00:13:41,988 --> 00:13:43,521
SISTER, MY NIECE'S MOTHER, SHE

283
00:13:43,523 --> 00:13:45,323
DIDN'T KNOW SHE COULD GET

284
00:13:45,325 --> 00:13:45,690
PREGNANT.

285
00:13:45,692 --> 00:13:47,091
SHE FOSTERED THEN ADOPTED THREE

286
00:13:47,093 --> 00:13:47,959
BLACK KIDS.

287
00:13:47,961 --> 00:13:49,561
THEN SHE FINALLY GOT PREGNANT.

288
00:13:49,563 --> 00:13:52,263
NOW SHE HAS A KID WITH DOWN

289
00:13:52,265 --> 00:13:52,664
SYNDROME.

290
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:54,299
HER HUSBAND IS FROM EGYPT, HE'S

291
00:13:54,301 --> 00:13:55,233
AN ARAB GUY.

292
00:13:55,235 --> 00:13:56,835
YOU GO TO THE HOUSE, IT'S LIKE

293
00:13:56,837 --> 00:13:58,503
GETTING INTO THE CRAZIEST UBER

294
00:13:58,505 --> 00:13:59,037
POOL YOU'VE BEEN IN.

295
00:13:59,439 --> 00:14:01,606
IT'S CRAZY.

296
00:14:01,608 --> 00:14:02,607
LIKE, HOW DID YOU GUYS MEET?

297
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:07,846
BUT THERE'S SOMETHING, I DON'T

298
00:14:07,848 --> 00:14:10,048
KNOW -- MY NIECE, ONE DAY -- I'M

299
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:11,349
NOT SAYING IT'S SOMETHING I'M

300
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:13,117
LOOKING FORWARD TO, BUT I THINK

301
00:14:13,119 --> 00:14:13,852
IT WILL BE A NICE THING FOR THE

302
00:14:13,854 --> 00:14:17,589
WHOLE COUNTRY.

303
00:14:17,591 --> 00:14:18,289
I WOULD SAY WHEN MY NIECE IS

304
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:19,490
PROBABLY IN FIFTH, SIXTH GRADE,

305
00:14:19,492 --> 00:14:20,992
OUT AT RECESS, SOME WHITE KIDS

306
00:14:20,994 --> 00:14:22,961
OUT THERE, "HEY, YOU'RE NOT

307
00:14:22,963 --> 00:14:25,663
ALLOWED TO PLAY WITH US, YOU'RE

308
00:14:25,665 --> 00:14:26,064
RETARDED."

309
00:14:26,066 --> 00:14:27,298
THEN THREE BLACK KIDS COME

310
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:28,333
FLYING OUT OF NOWHERE.

311
00:14:28,335 --> 00:14:31,769
START WHALING ON THAT CRACKER.

312
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:35,807
EVERYONE'S GOING TO BE BE LIKE,

313
00:14:35,809 --> 00:14:36,074
OH!

314
00:14:36,076 --> 00:14:38,109
IT'S A NICE MOMENT.

315
00:14:38,712 --> 00:14:41,546
YEAH, I SAID CRACKER.

316
00:14:41,548 --> 00:14:47,452
NO WE -- MY FAMILY AND I, BY

317
00:14:47,454 --> 00:14:48,119
OPENED A COFFEE SHOP IN MY

318
00:14:48,121 --> 00:14:48,853
HOMETOWN FOR PEOPLE WITH DOWN

319
00:14:48,855 --> 00:14:50,788
SYNDROME TO WORK AT.

320
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:53,191

00:23:06,803 --> 00:23:08,803
ONCE, BUT IF THEY SAY NO, YOU

CANNOT ASK THEM AGAIN.

LAUREL, WILL YOU GO OUT WITH ME?

586
00:23:19,816 --> 00:23:20,581
>> NO.

587
00:23:20,583 --> 00:23:23,317
>> SO THAT'S IT, THEN?

588
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:24,752
LIKE, THAT DOOR IS CLOSED UNTIL

589
00:23:24,754 --> 00:23:25,719
IT RESETS AT THE END OF THE

590
00:23:25,721 --> 00:23:26,020
YEAR?

591
00:23:26,789 --> 00:23:27,321

00:23:29,892 --> 00:23:31,826
I THINK I UNDERSTAND.

595
00:23:31,828 --> 00:23:33,527
I CAN'T ASK LAUREL OUT AGAIN,

596
00:23:33,529 --> 00:23:35,062
WHICH MEANS I HAVE TO MOVE ON TO

597
00:23:35,064 --> 00:23:37,398
MY SECOND CHOICE, CARLEY.

598
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:39,800

599
00:23:39,802 --> 00:23:41,936

619
00:24:11,701 --> 00:24:13,167
>> ANOTHER QUESTION.

620
00:24:13,169 --> 00:24:13,934
SO WE ALL KNOW CLARK IS GAY,

621
00:24:13,936 --> 00:24:16,670

664
00:25:29,545 --> 00:25:30,578
MONTHS.

665
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:31,345
IS IT BAD THAT I'M HIS DIRECT

666
00:25:31,347 --> 00:25:33,314
SUPERIOR?

667
00:25:33,316 --> 00:25:36,150
>> YES, THAT'S OBVIOUSLY BAD.

668
00:25:36,719 --> 00:25:37,451

JUST DOING IT TO GET A RAISE?

670

TODAY.

677
00:25:50,967 --> 00:25:52,700
AN OFFICE IS A SACRED PLACE.

678
00:25:52,702 --> 00:25:53,434
AND OFFICE RELATIONSHIPS ARE

679
00:25:53,436 --> 00:25:55,436
TOUGH.

680
00:25:55,438 --> 00:25:56,203

COVER.

687

YOU CAN BANK YESES, AND THEY

00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:11,585
ROLL OVER EVERY YEAR.

689
00:26:12,688 --> 00:26:13,387

>> NO, THEY ARE NOT.

695
00:26:27,103 --> 00:26:28,002
>> THAT WAS NEVER OKAY.

696
00:26:28,004 --> 00:26:29,203
>> NEVER.

697

ALL THE EMBRYOS ARE DOING IT.

1263
00:43:44,072 --> 00:43:45,338
SURE, IT MIGHT BE BAD FOR ME.

1264

00:49:17,839 --> 00:49:20,706
I DON'T NEED TO TELL YOU THIS,

1445
00:49:20,708 --> 00:49:23,843
BUT SHE'S THE REASON EVERY NURSE

1446
00:49:23,845 --> 00:49:24,243
IS A WOMAN.

1447
00:49:24,245 --> 00:49:25,011
>> NOT ALL NURSES ARE WOMEN.

1448
00:49:25,013 --> 00:49:25,845
>> THEY SHOULD BE.

1449

THEY'RE FULL OF LEAST, AND

1457
00:49:42,864 --> 00:49:43,496
THEY'RE TECHNICALLY ALIVE.

1458
00:49:50,338 --> 00:49:52,004

MEAN THINGS TO THEM.

1463
00:49:58,479 --> 00:49:59,211
>> THEY'RE THE ONES WHO ARE MEAN

1464
00:49:59,213 --> 00:50:00,780
TO ME.

1465
00:50:00,782 --> 00:50:01,514
ONE WOMAN CALLED ME A NASTY HOMO

1466
00:50:01,516 --> 00:50:01,981
THE OTHER DAY.

1467
00:50:01,983 --> 00:50:03,015
>> OH MY GOD, THAT'S AWFUL.

1468
00:50:03,017 --> 00:50:04,016

ELEANOR ROOSEVELT.

1476
00:50:16,497 --> 00:50:17,496
SHE PUSHED FDR DOWN THE STAIRS.

KICKED HIM WITH HER BIG LESBIAN

1481

SHE LIED TO THOSE GUYS.

1482
00:50:25,873 --> 00:50:27,106
SHE KNEW WHERE THE GOLD WAS.

1483

>> GOLD, WHAT GOLD?

1484
00:50:29,577 --> 00:50:30,276
YOU'RE JUST MAKING UP THESE

1485

DO YOU LIKE WOMEN AT ALL?

1487
00:50:34,382 --> 00:50:35,381
>> OH, PLEASE, COLIN.

1488

NO ONE LOVES WOMEN LIKE A GAY

1489
00:50:36,117 --> 00:50:37,750
MAN -- WHO HATES WOMEN.

1490
