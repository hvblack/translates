TO PREPARE FOR THE EVENING'S
PERFORMANCE.

126
00:10:21,273 --> 00:10:22,454
WE WERE DOING IT BACKSTAGE,

127
00:10:22,454 --> 00:10:26,089
AND I NOTICED ONE OF THE BACK STAGE
CREW WAS VIDEO TAPING US,

128
00:10:26,089 --> 00:10:29,400
AND I
THOUGHT, THAT WOULD BE
INTERESTING TO SHOW THE AUDIENCE

129
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:33,016
SO HERE IS MARTY AND I GETTING
READY FOR TONIGHT'S SHOW.

130
00:10:36,332 --> 00:10:38,172
AND CAN I SAY, STEVE--

131
00:10:38,172 --> 00:10:40,153
LET THEM LAUGH.

132
00:10:40,864 --> 00:10:44,799

133
00:10:44,799 --> 00:10:47,479
AND I HOPE WE CAN DO THIS
FOREVER.

134
00:10:47,479 --> 00:10:52,524
OF COURSE I THOUGHT ABOUT
THAT, BUT I REALIZED YOU'RE NOT
GOING TO LIVE FOREVER,

135
00:10:52,524 --> 00:10:57,163
AND THAT
IS SAD BECAUSE YOU WON'T BE ABLE

136
00:10:57,163 --> 00:10:59,355
I'M
GOING TO SAY AT YOUR MEMORIAL.

137
00:10:59,355 --> 00:11:01,350
SO I THOUGHT, WHY WAIT

138
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:05,857
SO WHAT I DID WAS I WROTE UP
YOUR EULOGY

139
00:11:05,857 --> 00:11:07,230
SO YOU CAN HEAR IT NOW.

140
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:10,194
THAT IS SUCH A COINCIDENCE
BECAUSE

141
00:11:10,194 --> 00:11:12,514
I DID THE SAME THING
I WROTE YOUR EULOGY.

142
00:11:12,514 --> 00:11:13,501
REALLY?

143
00:11:13,501 --> 00:11:15,242
- LET'S READ THEM TOGETHER
- WHY NOT.

144
00:11:15,242 --> 00:11:17,824
THIS IS A SAD MOMENT.

145
00:11:17,824 --> 00:11:21,090
CAN YOU PLAY SOMETHING SAD FOR
US, PLEASE

146
00:11:22,608 --> 00:11:26,931
NOT SAD ENOUGH.
ANYTHING SADDER?

147
00:11:29,728 --> 00:11:34,380
NO, NO, NO.
DO YOU HAVE SOMETHING REALLY,
REALLY SAD

148
00:11:44,854 --> 00:11:50,292
SO, MARTY, I DEDICATE THIS
EULOGY TO YOU.

149
00:11:50,292 --> 00:11:53,635
WOW, NOT MUCH OF A TURNOUT

WHITE HAIRED SON OF A BITCH.
WHERE DID YOU GO

157
00:12:33,217 --> 00:12:35,747
I KNOW STEVE IS LOOKING DOWN ON
US RIGHT NOW

158
00:12:35,747 --> 00:12:38,509
BECAUSE HE ALWAYS
LOOKED DOWN ON EVERYBODY

159
00:12:39,832 --> 00:12:42,699
AND YES, I LEARNED SO MUCH FROM
STEVE.

160
00:12:42,699 --> 00:12:46,016
FOR EXAMPLE, HE TAUGHT ME YOU
DON'T NEED TO RESTRICT A URINAL

161
00:12:46,016 --> 00:12:48,518
TO JUST NUMBER ONE

162
00:12:53,656 --> 00:12:57,544
EVEN AT THE END, MARTY HAD A
WONDERFUL GIRLFRIEND

163
00:12:57,544 --> 00:13:02,445
SMART, BEAUTIFUL, AND SO REALISTIC.

164
00:13:04,381 --> 00:13:07,061
BUT MARTY WAS ALWAYS SEXUALLY ACTIVE

165
00:13:07,061 --> 00:13:10,448
AS LONG AS THERE WERE
BATTERIES IN THE HOUSE

166
00:13:10,448 --> 00:13:13,711
BUT MARTY WAS TAKEN AWAY FROM US
TOO SOON

167
00:13:13,711 --> 00:13:19,005
BUT SADLY, NOT BEFORE HE PLAYED
JACK FROST IN "SANTA CLAUS 3".

168
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:23,283
OH, STEVE

169
00:13:23,283 --> 00:13:27,839
OH, STEVE, IT'S SO HARD TO
LOOK AT YOU IN THAT OPEN CASKET,

170
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:31,361
MOTIONLESS, COLORLESS, STIFF,

171
00:13:31,361 --> 00:13:33,777
SO LIFE LIKE.

172
00:13:34,013 --> 00:13:39,539
AND YET, SEEING YOU IN YOUR
CASKET REMINDS ME OF THAT
CLASSIC SNL SKETCH,

173
00:13:39,539 --> 00:13:42,167
DICK IN A BOX.

174
00:13:46,224 --> 00:13:48,304
THANK YOU.

175
00:13:48,862 --> 00:13:51,574
THE GOOD NEWS IS WITH STEVE
GONE,

176
00:13:51,574 --> 00:13:55,651
DOWNLOADS SHOULD BE SO
MUCH FASTER ON PORN HUB.

177
00:13:55,983 --> 00:13:59,231
PEOPLE ALWAYS ASK ME WHAT STEVE
WAS REALLY LIKE,

178
00:13:59,231 --> 00:14:02,060
AND I WOULD
SAY, I DON'T KNOW, YOU'RE HIS WIFE

179
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:03,910
AND HE'S SUCH A GREAT DAD,

180
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:06,854
AND
YOU CAN TELL THAT FROM HIS CHILDREN
THEY'RE SO POLITE.

181
00:14:06,927 --> 00:14:10,980
YOU GO TO HIS HOUSE AND THEY
SAY, WOULD YOU LIKE ANYTHING,
MR. SHORT?

182
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:13,190
CAN I GET YOU A DRINK,
MR. SHORT?

183
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:17,850
CAN YOU GIVE THIS NOTE TO THE
POLICE, MR. SHORT?

184
00:14:18,342 --> 00:14:22,641
NOW THAT MARTY IS GONE, WHO
WILL I EVER WORK WITH?

185
00:14:22,641 --> 00:14:24,408
HOW ABOUT ME?

186
00:14:28,932 --> 00:14:32,078
WE HAVE A GREAT SHOW

187
00:14:32,078 --> 00:14:33,468
STICK

188
00:14:33,468 --> 00:14:35,353
BYE

189
00:14:40,561 --> 00:14:41,909
PBS

00:14:41,909 --> 00:14:45,472
CURIOUS GEORGE

00:14:45,472 --> 00:14:48,207
SCIENCE ROOM

192
00:14:56,285 --> 00:15:00,743
CHEMISTRY,

193
00:15:00,743 --> 00:15:05,375
HOW LOVELY ARE THY
IONS ♪

194
00:15:05,375 --> 00:15:09,596
I LOVE THAT SONG SO MUCH.

195
00:15:09,596 --> 00:15:13,159
- HEY, KIDS, I'M DR. SCIENCE.
- AND I'M MR. SCIENCE.

196
00:15:13,159 --> 00:15:17,862
AND WHAT BETTER TIME THAN THE
HOLIDAYS TO LEARN ABOUT THE
SCIENCE OF SNOW.

197
00:15:17,862 --> 00:15:23,441
HELPING US TODAY ARE LONI AND
JOSH

198
00:15:23,441 --> 00:15:24,493
HI

199
00:15:24,493 --> 00:15:28,523
HAPPY HOLIDAYS, GUYS
LONI, WHAT'S YOUR FAVORITE
HOLIDAY TRADITION?

200
00:15:28,523 --> 00:15:31,676
- CHRISTMAS.
- OKAY.

201
00:15:31,677 --> 00:15:33,336
MYSELF

202
00:15:33,336 --> 00:15:36,147
WELL-- JOSH, WHAT DO YOU WANT
FOR CHRISTMAS?

203
00:15:36,147 --> 00:15:40,282
TO FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED TO MY BROTHER

204
00:15:44,091 --> 00:15:46,583
OKAY.
WELL, I WAS NOT EXPECTING THAT

205
00:15:46,583 --> 00:15:49,247
I THOUGHT YOU WOULD SAY YOU WANT
A SKATEBOARD OR SOMETHING,

206
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:51,695
BUT
I'M SURE YOUR BROTHER WILL BE
FINE

207
00:15:51,695 --> 00:15:54,200
LET'S TALK ABOUT SNOW.

208
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,473
WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT SNOW?

209
00:15:56,473 --> 00:16:01,749
FOR ONE, SNOW FORMS IN THE BIG
THINGS IN THE SKY CALLED--

210
00:16:01,749 --> 00:16:04,042
- LONI
- STARS.

211
00:16:04,042 --> 00:16:06,832
NO.
JOSH
STARTS WITH A C.

212
00:16:06,832 --> 00:16:09,240
SI, SENOR.

213
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:12,260
NO, THE LETTER
C. C-WORD

214
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:14,442
THE C WORD IS BAD.
CAN'T SAY THAT.

215
00:16:14,442 --> 00:16:17,322
NOT THE C WORD.

216
00:16:17,322 --> 00:16:20,888
IT'S BIG, IT'S WHITE IT'S PUFFY.

217
00:16:20,888 --> 00:16:22,118
MY DAD?

218
00:16:22,118 --> 00:16:25,811
CLOUDS.
SNOW FORMS INSIDE CLOUDS.

219
00:16:25,811 --> 00:16:29,724
LET'S THINK BEFORE WE ANSWER.

220
00:16:29,724 --> 00:16:34,157
NOW SNOW FORMS WHEN IT GETS SO
COLD THAT THE WATER VAPOR INSIDE A CLOUD

221
00:16:34,157 --> 00:16:37,278
- DOES WHAT, LONI?
- SNOWS.

222
00:16:37,278 --> 00:16:40,457
NO. IT'S HOW WATER TURNS INTO AN ICE.

223
00:16:40,538 --> 00:16:43,483
IT STARTS WITH AN F.
JOSH

224
00:16:43,483 --> 00:16:45,580
PHFOE SYNTHESIS.

225
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:48,265
WRONG

226
00:16:48,365 --> 00:16:49,695
STARTS WITH AN F--

227
00:16:49,695 --> 00:16:52,500
- FREE--
- BRITNEY

228
00:16:53,207 --> 00:16:56,624
GUYS, FREEZE. FREEZE.

229
00:16:56,684 --> 00:17:01,129
NO, YOU.THE WORD WAS FREEZE.

230
00:17:01,624 --> 00:17:06,334
JUST LIKE THERE ARE
RAINSTORMS, ALREADY ALSO SNOWSTORMS.

231
00:17:06,426 --> 00:17:07,537
TRUE.

232
00:17:07,537 --> 00:17:11,409
I WASN'T ASKING, BUT YES,
THAT IS TRUE.

233
00:17:11,409 --> 00:17:13,744
YOU DON'T HIGH FIVE EACH
OTHER BASED--

234
00:17:13,744 --> 00:17:15,467
DON'T FIST BUMP
EITHER

235
00:17:15,467 --> 00:17:17,336
STOP IT RIGHT NOW.

236
00:17:17,336 --> 00:17:21,447
FOR OUR EXPERIMENT TODAY,
WE'RE GOING TO MAKE OUR OWN SNOWSTORM.

237
00:17:21,447 --> 00:17:25,270
IT WILL OBVIOUSLY NOT BE AS BIG
AS A REAL ONE.

238
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:29,271
BUT EVEN IF SOMETHING'S SMALL,
IT CAN STILL--

239
00:17:29,271 --> 00:17:31,720
FEEL GOOD FOR THE GIRL?

240
00:17:38,321 --> 00:17:40,446
I DON'T FOLLOW THIS.

241
00:17:40,572 --> 00:17:45,000
BECAUSE MY SISTER TOLD ME
THAT EVEN IF THE GUY HAS A SMALL THING,

242
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,312
IT CAN STILL FEEL GOOD IF
THE GUY KNOWS WHAT HE'S DOING.

243
00:17:48,312 --> 00:17:51,872
NO.
IT'S TEACH A BIG LESSON.

244
00:17:51,872 --> 00:17:53,975
YOU WERE VERY, VERY WRONG.

245
00:17:53,975 --> 00:17:57,984
YOUR SISTER, HOWEVER, IS
VERY, VERY RIGHT

246
00:17:58,534 --> 00:18:01,406
NOW, TO DO THIS AT HOME,

247
00:18:01,406 --> 00:18:05,030
WE'LL NEED SOME WATER IN A GLASS, BABY OIL--

248
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:08,030
DON'T TOUCH THAT, PLEASE, GUYS.
STOP IT.

249
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:11,520
AND PAINT-- STOP TOUCHING
IT, PLEASE.

250
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,936
MAKE SURE TO HAVE A GROWN UP
HELP YOU FIRST
SAFETY FIRST.

251
00:18:14,936 --> 00:18:18,516
I HAVE A FUN SAFETY JOKE, JOSH

252
00:18:18,516 --> 00:18:20,100
- KNOCK, KNOCK.
- COME IN.

253
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:23,840
NO. JOSH
YOU SAY,

254
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,973
KNOCK, KNOCK, WHO'S
THERE.

255
00:18:25,973 --> 00:18:28,267
- KNOCK, KNOCK.
- WHO'S THERE

256
00:18:28,267 --> 00:18:30,123
- SAFETY.
- HI. I'M JOSH.

257
00:18:30,123 --> 00:18:33,544
DO YOU NOT KNOW HOW THIS
WORKS?

258
00:18:33,544 --> 00:18:35,701
YOU SAY SAFETY WHO

259
00:18:35,701 --> 00:18:38,373
- KNOCK, KNOCK.
- SAFETY WHO.

260
00:18:43,958 --> 00:18:47,966
- ARE YOU OKAY, MR. SCIENCE
- I'M UPSET.

261
00:18:47,966 --> 00:18:53,016
- COME BACK, LITTLE BUDDY
COME BACK.
- BREATHE IN, BREATHE OUT

262
00:18:53,016 --> 00:18:57,507
WE PUT EVERYTHING INTO OUR GLASS
HERE EXCEPT THE ALKASELTZER

263
00:18:57,507 --> 00:19:02,141
DROP TO SIMULATE
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN COLD
AIR MEETS WARM AIR

264
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:03,767
GET IN CLOSE, GUYS

265
00:19:03,767 --> 00:19:08,816
THREE, TWO, ONE, SCIENCE.

266
00:19:09,221 --> 00:19:12,516
JOSH, WHAT'S GOING ON?

267
00:19:12,516 --> 00:19:15,552
NOT MUCH.
WE HAVE TWO WEEKS OFF FOR WINTER BREAK.

268
00:19:15,552 --> 00:19:19,762
NOT IN YOUR LIFE.
IN HERE.
WHAT'S GOING ON IN HERE?

269
00:19:19,762 --> 00:19:22,192
DO YOU SEE WHAT I SEE?
WHAT DO YOU SEE?

270
00:19:22,192 --> 00:19:23,999
- YOUR FINGER
- NO.

271
00:19:23,999 --> 00:19:27,439
SOMETHING'S GOING ON
DO YOU SEE WHAT I SEE?

272
00:19:27,493 --> 00:19:32,395
♪ DO YOU SEE WHAT I SEE, A STAR
A STAR ♪

273
00:19:32,395 --> 00:19:34,878
SHUT UP, YOU IDIOTS

274
00:19:34,878 --> 00:19:37,981
LOOK WHAT WE'VE MADE
IT'S A WHAT?

275
00:19:37,981 --> 00:19:40,972
IT'S A ME, MARIO.

276
00:19:40,972 --> 00:19:43,981
NO.
IT'S NOT A ME MARIO.
GO TO COMMERCIAL.

277
00:19:43,981 --> 00:19:47,013
TURN THE CAMERA OFF
I'M GOING TO CHOKE THIS KID!

278
00:19:56,065 --> 00:19:58,811
CHELSEA?

279
00:19:59,077 --> 00:20:01,166
- YOUR EX CHELSEA
- YEAH.

280
00:20:01,166 --> 00:20:02,847
I HAVEN'T THOUGHT ABOUT HER
IN A WHILE.

281
00:20:02,919 --> 00:20:05,754
WHEN YOU GUYS BROKE UP, IT
WAS SUCH A RELIEF.

282
00:20:05,755 --> 00:20:08,620
- WORST
- SHE WAS SUCH A NEGATIVE PERSON.

283
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:11,852
- A BAD PERSON.
- WHENEVER SHE WOULD WALK INTO
A ROOM, IT WAS LIKE,

284
00:20:11,852 --> 00:20:14,585
I GUESS
THIS ROOM IS GOING TO SUCK A
LITTLE BIT.

285
00:20:14,585 --> 00:20:17,834
I WOULD HAVE DAY TREATMENTS
OF HER BEING STEPD ON BY A GIANT.

286
00:20:17,834 --> 00:20:20,613
SHE WOULD ALWAYS HAVE FOOD ON
HER SHIRT LIKE A BABY.

287
00:20:20,613 --> 00:20:24,277
HOT DOG
BELONG IN
MY NOUGT OR ON MY SHIRT.

288
00:20:24,278 --> 00:20:27,588
CHELSEA COOL
DEAD GUY

289
00:20:27,588 --> 00:20:29,853
SHE STUNG.
SHE WAS STINKY.

00:20:29,854 --> 00:20:32,554
PAWN
SLOPPY

291
00:20:32,554 --> 00:20:35,725
YEAH.
EWW, CHELSEA.

292
00:20:35,725 --> 00:20:39,022
- WHY?
WHAT'S GOING ON WITH CHELSEA

293
00:20:42,644 --> 00:20:45,327
- YOU DID

294
00:20:47,199 --> 00:20:49,911
CHELSEA.
CHELSEA.

295
00:20:49,911 --> 00:20:52,260
IT IS SO GOOD TO SEE YOU.
JOHN, WHAT THE HELL?

296
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:54,169
SO ARE YOU GUYS SERIOUS OR CASUAL

297
00:20:54,169 --> 00:20:56,609
JOHN JUST PROPOSED.
WEDDING IS IN JUNE.

298
00:20:56,609 --> 00:20:59,010
LOVE IT
CAN'T WAIT TO MEET THE FAMILIAR.

299
00:20:59,010 --> 00:21:01,752
YOU ALREADY DID
THEY'RE ON ZOOM.

300
00:21:03,408 --> 00:21:06,843
- WHAT'S UP, FAMILY
- Y'ALL DON'T SEEM TOO HAPPY
WITH ME.

301
00:21:06,843 --> 00:21:09,035
ANYONE TALKS CRAP ABOUT MY
DAUGHTER,

302
00:21:09,035 --> 00:21:11,593
I'LL HUNT YOU DOWN--

303
00:21:11,593 --> 00:21:12,625
TURN THAT OFF

304
00:21:12,625 --> 00:21:16,106
- YOU REMEMBER THAT STUFF WE WERE
TALKING ABOUT EARLIER?
- I DO.

305
00:21:16,106 --> 00:21:19,847
WE WERE TALKING ABOUT JOHN'S
OTHER EX COURTNEY.

306
00:21:19,847 --> 00:21:23,363
YES. COURTNEY WAS THE ONE WHO WAS
LIKE A FUGLY NERD.

307
00:21:23,363 --> 00:21:24,799

SAY THAT AGAIN.
I DARE YOU.

461
00:29:51,699 --> 00:29:53,829

464
00:29:58,605 --> 00:30:00,676
CAN I TALK WITH YOU

465
00:30:00,676 --> 00:30:04,396
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
YOU'RE JUST SAYING YES TO EVERYTHING.

466
00:30:04,396 --> 00:30:07,840
- BUT I LOVE CHILDREN.
- THERE ARE 2 BILLION OF THEM,

467
00:30:07,913 --> 00:30:12,025
AND THEY ALL WANT A FORTNIGHT
BATTLE PASS, WHATEVER THE HELL
THAT IS.

468
00:30:12,025 --> 00:30:16,942
CALM DOWN.
EVERY YEAR WE'RE AFRAID WE CAN'T
PULL IT OFF, BUT WE ALWAYS DO.

469
00:30:16,942 --> 00:30:19,445

472
00:30:26,061 --> 00:30:29,091
IT'S CALLED SPEED.

- WELL, IT'S SOME KIND OF
VITAMIN THAT MAKES YOU GO FASTER

474
00:30:33,253 --> 00:30:35,686
WE JUST HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WHERE
TO GET SOME.

475
00:30:35,755 --> 00:30:37,973
CAN'T YOU ASK ONE OF THE KIDS
IF THEY HAVE ANYTHING.

476
00:30:37,973 --> 00:30:42,314
I'M NOT ALLOWED TO ASK THEM
FOR STUFF, BUT MAYBE IF ONE OF
THEM BRINGS IT UP--

477
00:30:42,314 --> 00:30:43,353

479

480
00:30:52,805 --> 00:30:54,556

00:41:50,487 --> 00:41:55,758
THE SUPREME COURT HEARD A
CASE THIS WEEK OVER WHETHER A
CONSERVATIVE EVANGELICAL WOMAN

612
00:41:55,758 --> 00:41:59,121
CAN REFUSE TO DESIGN

613
00:41:59,121 --> 00:42:03,028
HONEY, I DON'T KNOW GAY COUPLE WHO'S GOING
TO HIRE A DESIGNER

614
00:42:03,028 --> 00:42:05,248
WITH THOSE HIGHLIGHTS

615
00:42:10,869 --> 00:42:13,878
- HONEY?
- I'M SO SORRY

616
00:42:14,112 --> 00:42:16,304
I APOLOGIZE.

617
00:42:16,304 --> 00:42:21,508
DURING ORAL ARGUMENTS IN THE
CASE, JUSTICE SAMUEL ALITO
RAISED THE QUESTION,

618
00:42:21,508 --> 00:42:25,402
COULD A
BLACK DEPARTMENT STORE SANTA BE
FORCED TO TAKE A PICTURE

619
00:42:25,402 --> 00:42:27,635
WITH A
CHILD IN A CLAN ROBE

620
00:42:27,635 --> 00:42:30,066
ALITO ADDED HE WOULD LOVE AN ANSWER

621
00:42:30,134 --> 00:42:33,657
BEFORE HE TAKES HIS GRAND KIDS
TO THE MALL NEXT WEEK.

622
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:39,331
DONALD TRUMP SAID THE RESULTS
OF THE 2020 ELECTION SHOULD BE
OVERTURNED

623
00:42:39,331 --> 00:42:41,657
AND CALLED FOR THE
TERMINATION OF THE CONSTITUTION.

624
00:42:41,657 --> 00:42:46,878
TRUMP PLANS TO TERMINATE THE
CONSTITUTION BY ASKING HERSCHEL
WALKER TO DRIVE IT TO THE
CLINIC

625
00:42:51,407 --> 00:42:56,593
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU GUYS SAW
TODAY, MOROCCO BEAT PORTUGAL
IN QUATERFINAL

626
00:42:56,593 --> 00:43:01,685
IT'S THE BEST WORLD CUP

627
00:43:01,685 --> 00:43:05,072
SINCE THE AFRICANS WHO BUILT THE STADIUMS.

628
00:43:07,827 --> 00:43:10,582
I DIDN'T DO IT

629
00:43:13,029 --> 00:43:15,722
PORTUGAL'S HEAD COACH DECIDED

630
00:43:15,722 --> 00:43:19,183
NOT TO START SOCCER LEGEND

631
00:43:19,183 --> 00:43:24,679
EVEN MORE INSULTING, AT HALF
TIME, HE TRIED TO TRADE RENALDO
FOR BRITTNEY GRINER.

632
00:43:26,389 --> 00:43:31,951
BUT THE BIGGEST UPSET WAS THAT
FAVORITE BRAZIL WAS ELIMINATED,

633
00:43:31,951 --> 00:43:35,529
EXCEPT FOR A TINY STRIP DOWN THE MIDDLE

634
00:43:40,420 --> 00:43:45,207
NIKE HAS OFFICIALLY CUT TIES
WITH BROOKLYN NETS STAR KYRIE IRVING

635
00:43:45,207 --> 00:43:47,368
OVER THE
ANTI-SEMITISM SCANDAL.

636
00:43:47,368 --> 00:43:52,027
HE SAID HE'S SO DEPRESSED, HE
MIGHT JUMP OFF THE EDGE OF THE
WORLD.

637
00:43:54,888 --> 00:43:59,809
TODAY WAS THE SANTA CON BAR
CRAWL IN NEW YORK CITY

638
00:43:59,809 --> 00:44:04,021
YEAH
THE ANNUAL REMINDER THAT WHILE
SANTA MAY EXIST,

639
00:44:04,021 --> 00:44:06,050
GOD DOESN'T.

640
00:44:07,058 --> 00:44:10,548
WELL, FOLKS, THE HOLIDAY
SEASON THE OFFICIALLY UPON US.

641
00:44:10,548 --> 00:44:14,078
HERE WITH SOME TIPS ON HOW TO
GET YOUR SHOPPING DONE QUICKLY

642
00:44:14,078 --> 00:44:19,525
IS MOST CHAOTIC
MARY ANN LOUISE FISHER.

643
00:44:21,097 --> 00:44:23,438
HELLO, MICHAEL.

644
00:44:24,628 --> 00:44:27,383
WE GOT THREE MINUTES TO DO THIS.

645
00:44:27,383 --> 00:44:29,632
I STILL GOT SEVEN STORES TO HIT
ON THIS BLOCK.

646
00:44:29,632 --> 00:44:32,703
- SO YOU HAVE BEEN PRETTY BUSY.
- I HAVE.

647
00:44:32,703 --> 00:44:36,542
SEE I'M ONE OF 27 CHILDREN, SO I
GOT A LOT OF SHOPPING TO DO.

648
00:44:36,542 --> 00:44:39,668
AND I NEED TO DO IT FAST AND CRAZY.

649
00:44:39,668 --> 00:44:42,136
YOU EVER SEEN THE AISLES AND
CROSS DRESS FOR LESS

650
00:44:42,136 --> 00:44:45,796
YEAH.
RACK.
MOST OF THE MERCHANDISE IS ON
THE GROUND.

651
00:44:45,796 --> 00:44:48,160
YEAH, THAT'S ME, MICHAEL.

652
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:52,006
ME
EVERY SINGLE ROSS, THAT'S ALL
ME.

653
00:44:52,006 --> 00:44:55,406
SO YOU'RE SINGLE HANDEDLY
TRASHING ALL THE ROSSS

654
00:44:55,406 --> 00:44:58,876
YOU EVER TRIPPED OVER A PAIR
OF SHORTS

655
00:44:58,876 --> 00:45:01,440
STRUCK TO A WINNY THE
POOH TEAPOT?

656
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:03,460
THAT WAS ME, MICHAEL.

657
00:45:03,460 --> 00:45:06,625
- WHY MESS EVERYTHING UP?
- POWER, MICHAEL.

658
00:45:06,625 --> 00:45:09,118
I NEED TO LEAVE MY MARK.

659
00:45:09,118 --> 00:45:12,740
AND SOMETIMES, TO FIND THAT ONE
PERFECT SHIRT,

660
00:45:12,740 --> 00:45:16,182
YOU HAVE TO
UNFOLD 40 AND DUMP THEM ALL ON
THE FLOOR.

661
00:45:16,182 --> 00:45:19,635
ALL RIGHT
WELL, YOU'RE HERE TO GIVE US
SOME HOLIDAY SHOPPING TIPS.

662
00:45:19,704 --> 00:45:22,186
THAT'S RIGHT.
TIP NUMBER ONE

663
00:45:22,186 --> 00:45:24,288
GET YOU ONE OF THESE

664
00:45:24,288 --> 00:45:28,106
DID YOU KNOW ANYONE CAN BUY A
NECK BRACE

665
00:45:28,106 --> 00:45:29,973
YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE TO GO TO A DOCTOR

666
00:45:29,973 --> 00:45:32,375
THESE THINGS MAKE PEOPLE STAY
OUT OF YOUR WAY.

667
00:45:32,375 --> 00:45:37,484
THEY THINK YOU'RE WOUNDED, BUT
ONLY YOU KNOW, YOUR NECK IS
STRONG AS HELL

668
00:45:37,846 --> 00:45:41,757
NOW, MICHAEL, GUESS HOW MUCH ALL
THESE SANTA PLATES WERE?

669
00:45:41,757 --> 00:45:43,423
- WHAT?
- $3.

670
00:45:43,423 --> 00:45:46,779
GUESS HOW MUCH THIS SHIRT WAS.

671
00:45:46,779 --> 00:45:49,514
- I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE--
- $3.

672
00:45:49,514 --> 00:45:51,432
- YOU WANT TO SEE HOW I GOT IT
- SURE.

673
00:45:51,432 --> 00:45:55,356
SO HOLD THIS, AND PRETEND YOU'RE
A CUSTOMER LOOKING AT IT.

674
00:45:55,356 --> 00:45:57,480
AIN'T THAT A LOVELY BLOUSE.

675
00:45:57,480 --> 00:46:01,418
GIVE ME THAT DAMN SHIRT
THAT WAS IN MY BASKET!

676
00:46:01,418 --> 00:46:05,030
THAT WAS INTENSE.

677
00:46:05,030 --> 00:46:08,756
I SEE HOW THAT WORKS FOR YOU
BUT DO YOU HAVE ANY OTHER TIPS

678
00:46:08,756 --> 00:46:12,156
TIP NUMBER TWO, IF YOUR BLOOD
ISSUING GAR DROPS,

679
00:46:12,156 --> 00:46:14,936
J.C. PENNY
GOT NUGGETS.

680
00:46:14,936 --> 00:46:16,966
WHAT?

681
00:46:16,966 --> 00:46:21,219
J.C. PENNY GOT CHICKEN
NUGGETS.

682
00:46:21,219 --> 00:46:25,487
ALL YOU GOT TO DO IS GET
YOURSELF STUCK TOEN THAT
ESCALATOR, MAKE A FUSS,

683
00:46:25,487 --> 00:46:28,874
AND THE
MANAGER WILL FIND YOU SOME
NUGGETS, OKAY?

684
00:46:28,874 --> 00:46:32,868
- ARE YOU ALL RIGHT
- NO, MICHAEL
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU TALKING
ABOUT?

685
00:46:32,868 --> 00:46:35,145
I KNOW TOO MUCH.
I'VE SEEN TOO MUCH

686
00:46:35,145 --> 00:46:36,883
IT'S A WAR ZONE OUT THERE,

687
00:46:36,883 --> 00:46:41,079
AND I
JUST GOT DONE DOING THREE TOURS
IN NORDSTROM IRAQ.

688
00:46:41,079 --> 00:46:44,975
IT'S JUST A DEPARTMENT STORE.
IT'S NOT THAT SERIOUS.

689
00:46:44,975 --> 00:46:46,740
YOU HAVE NO IDEA.

690
00:46:46,740 --> 00:46:48,851
I'M THE ONE OUT HERE ON THESE
FRONT LINES.

691
00:46:48,851 --> 00:46:52,382
NOW, MY THIRD AND FINAL TIP--
AND I SHOULDN'T HAVE TO SAY THIS,

692
00:46:52,382 --> 00:46:55,030
BUT IF YOU CAN, BE BLACK

693
00:46:55,030 --> 00:46:57,135
BECAUSE IF YOU'RE WHITE ACTING
LIKE THIS,

694
00:46:57,187 --> 00:47:01,228
SOMEONE WILL TAKE A
VIDEO, AND YOU WILL LOSE YOUR JOB.

695
00:47:01,228 --> 00:47:05,357
YOU SEE, MICHAEL, THERE'S NO
SUCH THING AS A BLACK KAREN.

696
00:47:05,357 --> 00:47:10,034
I COULD SLAP THE HELL OUT OF YOU
RIGHT NOW, AND NOBODY WOULD SAY
A WORD

697
00:47:10,034 --> 00:47:12,637
MY JOB IS SAFE.

698
00:47:12,637 --> 00:47:16,019
- WHAT DO YOU EVEN DO FOR WORK?
- I SUE THE CITY.

699
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:21,247
THE CITY HAS A LOT OF MONEY AND
A BUNCH OF UNEVEN SIDEWALKS, BABY

700
00:47:21,247 --> 00:47:23,049
MARY ANN LOUISE FISHER, EVERYBODY.

701
00:47:23,049 --> 00:47:25,303
I GOT YOU SOM
IT'S IN HERE SOMEWHERE.

702
00:47:25,303 --> 00:47:27,919
I'M GOOD.
I'M GOOD.

703
00:47:30,032 --> 00:47:34,293
CHRIS CHRISTIE'S NIECE
ARRESTED
FLIGHT TO NEWARK

704
00:47:34,293 --> 00:47:37,840
AFTER SHE
ACCUSED A LATINO FAMILY OF SMUGGLING COCAINE

705
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:42,188
THEN ASSAULTED MULTIPLE
OFFICERS BY BITING THEM AND
KICKING THEM IN THE GROIN.

706
00:47:42,188 --> 00:47:47,261
SHE'S BEEN SENTENCED TO LIFE IN
THE NEW JERSEY HALL OF FAME.

707
00:47:48,544 --> 00:47:52,141
A NEW ALBUM FROM R. KELLY WAS
REMOVED FROM A STREAMING SITES

708
00:47:52,141 --> 00:47:54,237
SEVERAL HOURS
AFTER IT WAS UPLOADED.

709
00:47:54,237 --> 00:47:56,902
IT WAS NOT EASY TO REMOVE HIS
STREAMS,

710
00:47:56,902 --> 00:47:59,790
SAID THE MAID WHO
CLEANED HIS COUCH.

711
00:48:03,048 --> 00:48:05,463
ON CHRISTMAS.

712
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:09,806
THE LOS ANGELES ZOO ANNOUNCED
THAT EVYLYN

713
00:48:09,806 --> 00:48:13,713
46 YEAR OLD GORILLA
RED HAIR
HAS BEEN EUTHANIZED,

714
00:48:13,713 --> 00:48:15,374
NOT BECAUSE SHE'S SICK

715
00:48:15,374 --> 00:48:19,239
BUT BECAUSE IT'S LA AND SHE'S IN HER
40s.

716
00:48:23,225 --> 00:48:24,961
THIS WILL GET YOU BACK

717
00:48:24,961 --> 00:48:28,902
A WOMAN IN TEXAS ALLEGEDLY
DUMPED THREE BUCKETS OF HUMAN WASTE

718
00:48:28,902 --> 00:48:31,411
IN FRONT OF A POLICE
DEPARTMENT AND DROVE AWAY.

719
00:48:31,411 --> 00:48:36,514
IT'S A RARE CASE OF E RADIC
BEHAVIOR FROM A LADY WHO POOPS
IN A BUCKET.

720
00:48:38,009 --> 00:48:41,739
ALSO POINT OUT
AS DIS-TURK AS THIS STORY IS,

721
00:48:41,739 --> 00:48:46,445
IT'S NOT AS DISTURBING AS
IMAGINING THE WOMAN'S DRIVE TO
THE POLICE STATION

722
00:48:46,445 --> 00:48:49,294
WITH FULL BUCKETS OF FECES

723
00:48:49,294 --> 00:48:55,129
BECAUSE ONE
SPEED BUMP TURNS HER CAR INTO A
STARBUCKS BATHROOM

724
00:48:56,539 --> 00:49:00,293
FRANCE ANNOUNCED THAT IT WILL
START PROVIDING FREE CONDOMS

725
00:49:00,293 --> 00:49:03,435
FOR
PEOPLE BETWEEN THE AGES OF 18
AND 25

726
00:49:03,435 --> 00:49:06,670
COOL
NOW DO DEODERANT.

727
00:49:10,389 --> 00:49:14,787
NEW BOOK
IN BEDROOM

728
00:49:14,787 --> 00:49:17,313
SHOWN
HOLIDAY MUST HAVE LISTS.

729
00:49:17,313 --> 00:49:21,072
HERE IT'S AUTHORS CURT AND DIB
FROM WYOMING

730
00:49:24,583 --> 00:49:28,367
HEY, GUYS.
HOW DID THIS BOOK COME ABOUT

731
00:49:28,367 --> 00:49:33,281
WE HAVE BEEN MARRIED CLOSE TO
20 YEARS NOW

732
00:49:33,836 --> 00:49:36,754
THINGS KIND OF FIZZLED OUT IN BED.

733
00:49:36,754 --> 00:49:42,267
BUT WE DISCOVERED MY WIFE HAS A
TALENT FOR DOING VOICES OF FAMOUS PEOPLE,

734
00:49:42,338 --> 00:49:45,158
SO WE TOOK THAT
INTO THE BEDROOM.

735
00:49:45,158 --> 00:49:49,576
- SO SORT OF LIKE ROLE PLAYING?
- YEAH, BUT WITH CELEBRITIES.

736
00:49:49,576 --> 00:49:52,690
FOR EXAMPLE, WE'LL SHOW YOU OUR
TECHNIQUE AT WORK.

737
00:49:52,690 --> 00:49:56,005
BABY, YOU WANT TO SHOW THEM DREW
BARRYMORE?

738
00:49:56,005 --> 00:49:57,392
LIKE THIS.

739
00:49:57,392 --> 00:50:02,126
OH, MY GOD, THAT FEELS
AMAZING.

740
00:50:02,126 --> 00:50:07,178
- YOU LIKE THAT, DREW
- YES, IT'S FANTASTIC.

741
00:50:07,178 --> 00:50:09,814
- HOW MUCH?
- SO MUCH

742
00:50:09,814 --> 00:50:14,422
- LOUDER.
COME ON.
- IT'S LITERALLY BLOWING MY MIND.

743
00:50:14,422 --> 00:50:18,839
- LOUDER. COME ON!
- IT'S ORGASMIC.

744
00:50:19,585 --> 00:50:22,527
I'M THE MASTER.

745
00:50:23,735 --> 00:50:28,161
- IS THAT NOT HOT AS HELL.
- I CAN SEE
WE'RE ALL GETTING REALLY TURNED ON.

746
00:50:28,161 --> 00:50:32,269
YEAH, YOU ARE, YOU HORN DOG

747
00:50:32,269 --> 00:50:36,560
SO DREW IS A GOOD GIRL, BUT SHE
DOES BAD GIRLS TOO

748
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:40,775
LIKE THAT
RUSSIAN CON ARTIST LADY FROM
INVENTING ANNA

749
00:50:40,775 --> 00:50:43,290
DO ANNA DELVEY

750
00:50:43,290 --> 00:50:46,714
OH, YOU'RE NOTHING, LITTLE
BOY.

751
00:50:46,714 --> 00:50:51,214
YES, MS. DELVEY.

752
00:50:51,214 --> 00:50:53,197
YOU'RE SO WEAK AND POOR.

753
00:50:53,197 --> 00:50:58,513
YES, PLEASE RUIN MY CREDIT SCORE.
RUIN MY CREDIT SCORE.

754
00:50:58,513 --> 00:51:00,935
MY ORGASM IS ON THE WAY.

755
00:51:00,935 --> 00:51:03,104
YEAH, IT IS, MS. DELVEY DAMN

756
00:51:03,104 --> 00:51:07,057
THAT'S GREAT.

757
00:51:10,269 --> 00:51:14,356
I'M CURIOUS HOW MANY VOICES DOES
SHE DO

758
00:51:14,356 --> 00:51:18,666
MAN, I THINK I MADE LOVE TO
ABOUT A THOUSAND CELEBRITIES AT
THIS POINT

759
00:51:18,666 --> 00:51:22,869
I MEAN, LAST NIGHT I WAS WITH
MS. MERYL STREEP

760
00:51:23,339 --> 00:51:27,094
- I GOT TO USE A PROP.
- YOU CAN USE A PROP.

761
00:51:28,397 --> 00:51:33,132
- OH, WELL, YOU KNOW, THAT'S
DELICIOUS.
- YEAH?

762
00:51:33,132 --> 00:51:37,259
- OH, IT'S UTTERLY DIVINE.
- YOU'RE SO TALENTED.

763
00:51:37,259 --> 00:51:40,983
IT'S LIKE MUSIC.

764
00:51:41,997 --> 00:51:45,482
- I FINISHED
- THERE IT IS

765
00:51:48,552 --> 00:51:52,507
I GOT A QUESTION.
DOES SHE DO ANY BLACK ONES

766
00:51:52,507 --> 00:51:55,061
NO, SHE DOES NOT.

767
00:51:55,061 --> 00:51:57,698
BUT SHE CAN DO-- WHAT'S HER NAME

768
00:51:57,698 --> 00:52:00,583
SCARLETT JOHANSSON

769
00:52:01,928 --> 00:52:05,531
DO YOU-- DO YOU KNOW HER?
YES, I DO.

770
00:52:05,531 --> 00:52:09,864
YOU KNOW HER?
HAVE YOU SEEN THAT MOVIE
UNDER HER SKIN

771
00:52:09,864 --> 00:52:11,863
I THINK IT'S UNDER THE SKIN.

772
00:52:11,863 --> 00:52:15,560
OF COURSE YOU KNOW WHAT IT'S
CALLED YOU HORN DOG.

773
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:17,685
LOOK AT YOU CORRECTING ME.

774
00:52:17,685 --> 00:52:20,511
24 MINUTES, 11 SECONDS

775
00:52:22,142 --> 00:52:24,260
DO SCARLET

776
00:52:25,340 --> 00:52:28,939
HEY, I'M MARRIED TO COLIN,
BUT I NEED A REAL MAN.

777
00:52:28,939 --> 00:52:31,714
YEAH, YOU DO.

778
00:52:31,810 --> 00:52:35,606
WHY DON'T YOU GET OVER HERE
BLACK WIDOW.
COME ON, BLACK WIDOW

779
00:52:35,606 --> 00:52:38,189
THIS SPIDER BITES, COLIN.

780
00:52:38,189 --> 00:52:41,772
I THINK WE'RE GOOD ON THAT ONE.

781
00:52:41,772 --> 00:52:45,027
I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT, IT
DOES SEEM LIKE DEB

782
00:52:45,027 --> 00:52:48,998
KIND OF DOES
ALL THE WORK WHILE YOU REAP THE BENEFITS.

783
00:52:48,998 --> 00:52:52,375
I'M NOT AS GOOD AT VOICES AS DEB,

784
00:52:52,375 --> 00:52:56,054
BUT I CAN SAY LIKE ONE
THING AS A FEW CARTOON CHARACTERS,

785
00:52:56,148 --> 00:52:59,801
- AND DEB GOT INTO IT. DIDN'T YOU
- UH-HUH.

786
00:52:59,801 --> 00:53:03,142
I LOVE LITTLE STEWY.
YOU WANT ME TO DO IT?

787
00:53:03,142 --> 00:53:05,450
HELLO, BRIAN.

00:53:05,450 --> 00:53:08,236
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO TO
ME, STEWY?

789
00:53:08,237 --> 00:53:10,806

795
00:53:28,978 --> 00:53:32,744

HATE

806
00:54:26,463 --> 00:54:29,039
I STARTED DRINKING EARLY.

807
00:54:29,039 --> 00:54:30,606
YES, YOU DID.

808
00:54:30,606 --> 00:54:36,697
NOW, WOULD YOU LOOK AT ALL THE
BEAUTIFUL LADIES IN THE AUDIENCE TONIGHT.

809
00:54:37,471 --> 00:54:41,265
WHO DON'T KNOW A DAMN THING
ABOUT HOW TO TREAT THEIR MAN

810
00:54:41,265 --> 00:54:42,913
HIT IT

811
00:54:49,257 --> 00:54:52,469
NOW, THAT'S HOW IT IS.

812
00:54:52,469 --> 00:54:56,491
THIS IS MY CHURCH, AND MINKY
IS MY PRIEST.

813
00:54:56,491 --> 00:54:58,208
THAT'S 100% TRUE.

814
00:54:58,208 --> 00:55:00,008
NOW, WHO'S GOT A QUESTION FOR
ME

815
00:55:00,008 --> 00:55:02,149
ME.
RIGHT HERE.

816
00:55:02,149 --> 00:55:04,800
OKAY.
WHITE GIRL WITH A LITTLE HEAD.

817
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:07,858
OH, ME?
OKAY

818
00:55:07,909 --> 00:55:09,944
WELL, HI, MINKY.

819
00:55:09,944 --> 00:55:14,095
SO AFTER A FIRST DATE, I DIDN'T
SLEEP WITH THE GUY, RIGHT,

820
00:55:14,151 --> 00:55:15,869
BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT TO SEEM LOOSE,

821
00:55:15,869 --> 00:55:17,883
 BUT NOW HE'S NOT CALLING
ME BACK.

822
00:55:17,883 --> 00:55:20,557
WHAT DID I DO WRONG?

823
00:55:20,997 --> 00:55:24,170
HMM, LET ME CONSULT WITH MY
RELATIONSHIP CALCULATOR.

824
00:55:24,170 --> 00:55:29,038
YOU WENT ON A DATE, YOU DIDN'T PUT OUT,

825
00:55:29,038 --> 00:55:33,283
 AND THAT EQUALS-- OF
COURSE HE'S NOT CALLING BACK

826
00:55:33,283 --> 00:55:34,876
HIT IT

827
00:55:41,779 --> 00:55:44,452
AND THAT'S JUST HOW IT IS.

828
00:55:44,452 --> 00:55:47,364
AW, COME ON, MINKY.

829
00:55:47,364 --> 00:55:51,395
HE SAID WHAT HE SAID.
SHUT UP.

830
00:55:51,395 --> 00:55:53,475
NEXT QUESTION

831
00:55:53,475 --> 00:55:56,169
OH, MINKY, HI

832
00:55:56,169 --> 00:55:58,305
SO HERE'S WHAT'S UP.

833
00:55:58,305 --> 00:56:01,868
I WAS ON A DATE AND FOUND PORNO
IN THIS GUY'S VCR.

834
00:56:01,868 --> 00:56:04,270
IS THAT A RED FLAG
WHAT SHOULD I DO

835
00:56:04,270 --> 00:56:09,093
GIRL, THE ONLY VCR I CARE
ABOUT IS A VERY COOL RACK.

836
00:56:09,093 --> 00:56:10,911
SLAM IT!

837
00:56:15,644 --> 00:56:18,923
AND THAT'S-- WHAT?
JUST HOW IT IS.

838
00:56:18,923 --> 00:56:21,804
WHO'S NEXT?

839
00:56:21,804 --> 00:56:25,375
HI, MINKY
HERE'S MY PROBLEM.

840
00:56:25,375 --> 00:56:29,018
I WAS FLIRTING WITH THIS GUY,
AND HE GAVE ME HIS NUMBER, 

841
00:56:29,018 --> 00:56:32,717
BUT I
NEVER CALLED HIM
DOES THAT MAKE ME A BAD NUMBER.

842
00:56:32,717 --> 00:56:34,826
UH, YEP

843
00:56:34,826 --> 00:56:36,625
SLAM IT!

844
00:56:41,917 --> 00:56:44,622
I'VE NEVER FELT BETTER IN ANY LIFE 

845
00:56:44,622 --> 00:56:45,707
NEXT

846
00:56:45,707 --> 00:56:49,326
YES
HI, EVERYONE
I'M JADA.
OH, NO, NO.

847
00:56:49,326 --> 00:56:52,931
- AND I WENT ON A DATE WITH
MINKY CARMICHAEL.
- CAN WE CUT HER MIC?

848
00:56:52,931 --> 00:56:56,736
AND I HAVE TO SAY, HE HAS H
THE WORST PENIS I'VE EVER SEEN

849
00:56:56,737 --> 00:56:58,004
MIC

850
00:56:58,004 --> 00:57:03,462
I'M NOT TRYING TO BE MEAN, BUT
IT LOOKED LIKE AN ESPRESSO CUP.

851
00:57:03,462 --> 00:57:07,687
FREEZING
THAT'S NOT 100% TRUE.

852
00:57:07,687 --> 00:57:09,319
ANYONE ELSE HAVE A QUESTION?

853
00:57:09,319 --> 00:57:13,293
YEAH, I HAVE A QUESTION
WHAT WAS SO HORRIBLE ABOUT HIS
THING?

854
00:57:13,385 --> 00:57:15,426
THE LENGTH WAS OKAY

855
00:57:15,426 --> 00:57:17,407
FELT LIKE THERE WAS NOTHING
INSIDE.

856
00:57:17,407 --> 00:57:19,077
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT?

857
00:57:19,077 --> 00:57:22,434
LIKE AT A CERTAIN POINT, HE
ASKED ME, DO YOU WANT ME TO
CLOSE IT.

858
00:57:22,434 --> 00:57:25,786
HOLD UP
WHAT WAS THERE TO CLOSE?

859
00:57:25,786 --> 00:57:28,761
I DON'T KNOW.
BUT I WOULD DESCRIBE IT AS OPEN,

860
00:57:28,761 --> 00:57:32,115
LIKE HOLLOW.
PEACE OF

861
00:57:34,349 --> 00:57:38,917
MINKY, SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE
PACKING THE WORM FROM DOOM.

862
00:57:38,917 --> 00:57:42,850
YOU KNOW WHAT
LET ME CONSULT MY

864
00:57:45,807 --> 00:57:49,741
HOLD ON.
LOOKS LIKE I'M GETTING A FAX--

865
00:57:54,095 --> 00:57:57,521
OH, MY GOD, IT'S FROM THE PENIS
HOSPITAL

866
00:57:57,521 --> 00:58:00,076
THEY SAY YOU NEED AN EMERGENCY APPOINTMENT.

867
00:58:00,076 --> 00:58:01,526
SLAM IT 

868
00:58:01,526 --> 00:58:04,785
NO. I'M THE ONE WHO SLAMS IT
YOU DON'T SLAM IT.

869
00:58:04,903 --> 00:58:08,680
I HEAR FROM THE PRODUCERS
THAT WE ARE OUT OF TIME

870
00:58:08,680 --> 00:58:10,045
