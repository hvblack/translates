TO PREPARE FOR THE EVENING'S
PERFORMANCE.

126
00:10:21,273 --> 00:10:22,454
WE WERE DOING IT BACKSTAGE,

127
00:10:22,454 --> 00:10:26,089
AND I NOTICED ONE OF THE BACK STAGE
CREW WAS VIDEO TAPING US,

128
00:10:26,089 --> 00:10:29,400
AND I
THOUGHT, THAT WOULD BE
INTERESTING TO SHOW THE AUDIENCE

129
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:33,016
SO HERE IS MARTY AND I GETTING
READY FOR TONIGHT'S SHOW.

130
00:10:36,332 --> 00:10:38,172
AND CAN I SAY, STEVE--

131
00:10:38,172 --> 00:10:40,153
LET THEM LAUGH.

132
00:10:40,864 --> 00:10:44,799

133
00:10:44,799 --> 00:10:47,479
AND I HOPE WE CAN DO THIS
FOREVER.

134
00:10:47,479 --> 00:10:52,524
OF COURSE I THOUGHT ABOUT
THAT, BUT I REALIZED YOU'RE NOT
GOING TO LIVE FOREVER,

135
00:10:52,524 --> 00:10:57,163
AND THAT
IS SAD BECAUSE YOU WON'T BE ABLE

136
00:10:57,163 --> 00:10:59,355
I'M
GOING TO SAY AT YOUR MEMORIAL.

137
00:10:59,355 --> 00:11:01,350
SO I THOUGHT, WHY WAIT

138
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:05,857
SO WHAT I DID WAS I WROTE UP
YOUR EULOGY

139
00:11:05,857 --> 00:11:07,230
SO YOU CAN HEAR IT NOW.

140
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:10,194
THAT IS SUCH A COINCIDENCE
BECAUSE

141
00:11:10,194 --> 00:11:12,514
I DID THE SAME THING
I WROTE YOUR EULOGY.

142
00:11:12,514 --> 00:11:13,501
REALLY?

143
00:11:13,501 --> 00:11:15,242
- LET'S READ THEM TOGETHER
- WHY NOT.

144
00:11:15,242 --> 00:11:17,824
THIS IS A SAD MOMENT.

145
00:11:17,824 --> 00:11:21,090
CAN YOU PLAY SOMETHING SAD FOR
US, PLEASE

146
00:11:22,608 --> 00:11:26,931
NOT SAD ENOUGH.
ANYTHING SADDER?

147
00:11:29,728 --> 00:11:34,380
NO, NO, NO.
DO YOU HAVE SOMETHING REALLY,
REALLY SAD

148
00:11:44,854 --> 00:11:50,292
SO, MARTY, I DEDICATE THIS
EULOGY TO YOU.

149
00:11:50,292 --> 00:11:53,635
WOW, NOT MUCH OF A TURNOUT

WHITE HAIRED SON OF A BITCH.
WHERE DID YOU GO

157
00:12:33,217 --> 00:12:35,747
I KNOW STEVE IS LOOKING DOWN ON
US RIGHT NOW

158
00:12:35,747 --> 00:12:38,509
BECAUSE HE ALWAYS
LOOKED DOWN ON EVERYBODY

159
00:12:39,832 --> 00:12:42,699
AND YES, I LEARNED SO MUCH FROM
STEVE.

160
00:12:42,699 --> 00:12:46,016
FOR EXAMPLE, HE TAUGHT ME YOU
DON'T NEED TO RESTRICT A URINAL

161
00:12:46,016 --> 00:12:48,518
TO JUST NUMBER ONE

162
00:12:53,656 --> 00:12:57,544
EVEN AT THE END, MARTY HAD A
WONDERFUL GIRLFRIEND

163
00:12:57,544 --> 00:13:02,445
SMART, BEAUTIFUL, AND SO REALISTIC.

164
00:13:04,381 --> 00:13:07,061
BUT MARTY WAS ALWAYS SEXUALLY ACTIVE

165
00:13:07,061 --> 00:13:10,448
AS LONG AS THERE WERE
BATTERIES IN THE HOUSE

166
00:13:10,448 --> 00:13:13,711
BUT MARTY WAS TAKEN AWAY FROM US
TOO SOON

167
00:13:13,711 --> 00:13:19,005
BUT SADLY, NOT BEFORE HE PLAYED
JACK FROST IN "SANTA CLAUS 3".

168
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:23,283
OH, STEVE

169
00:13:23,283 --> 00:13:27,839
OH, STEVE, IT'S SO HARD TO
LOOK AT YOU IN THAT OPEN CASKET,

170
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:31,361
MOTIONLESS, COLORLESS, STIFF,

171
00:13:31,361 --> 00:13:33,777
SO LIFE LIKE.

172
00:13:34,013 --> 00:13:39,539
AND YET, SEEING YOU IN YOUR
CASKET REMINDS ME OF THAT
CLASSIC SNL SKETCH,

173
00:13:39,539 --> 00:13:42,167
DICK IN A BOX.

174
00:13:46,224 --> 00:13:48,304
THANK YOU.

175
00:13:48,862 --> 00:13:51,574
THE GOOD NEWS IS WITH STEVE
GONE,

176
00:13:51,574 --> 00:13:55,651
DOWNLOADS SHOULD BE SO
MUCH FASTER ON PORN HUB.

177
00:13:55,983 --> 00:13:59,231
PEOPLE ALWAYS ASK ME WHAT STEVE
WAS REALLY LIKE,

178
00:13:59,231 --> 00:14:02,060
AND I WOULD
SAY, I DON'T KNOW, YOU'RE HIS WIFE

179
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:03,910
AND HE'S SUCH A GREAT DAD,

180
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:06,854
AND
YOU CAN TELL THAT FROM HIS CHILDREN
THEY'RE SO POLITE.

181
00:14:06,927 --> 00:14:10,980
YOU GO TO HIS HOUSE AND THEY
SAY, WOULD YOU LIKE ANYTHING,
MR. SHORT?

182
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:13,190
CAN I GET YOU A DRINK,
MR. SHORT?

183
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:17,850
CAN YOU GIVE THIS NOTE TO THE
POLICE, MR. SHORT?

184
00:14:18,342 --> 00:14:22,641
NOW THAT MARTY IS GONE, WHO
WILL I EVER WORK WITH?

185
00:14:22,641 --> 00:14:24,408
HOW ABOUT ME?

186
00:14:28,932 --> 00:14:32,078
WE HAVE A GREAT SHOW

187
00:14:32,078 --> 00:14:33,468
STICK

188
00:14:33,468 --> 00:14:35,353
BYE

189
00:14:40,561 --> 00:14:41,909
PBS

00:14:41,909 --> 00:14:45,472
CURIOUS GEORGE

SCIENCE ROOM

192
00:14:56,285 --> 00:15:00,743
CHEMISTRY,

193
00:15:00,743 --> 00:15:05,375
HOW LOVELY ARE THY
IONS ♪

194
00:15:05,375 --> 00:15:09,596
I LOVE THAT SONG SO MUCH.

195
00:15:09,596 --> 00:15:13,159
- HEY, KIDS, I'M DR. SCIENCE.
- AND I'M MR. SCIENCE.

196
00:15:13,159 --> 00:15:17,862
AND WHAT BETTER TIME THAN THE
HOLIDAYS TO LEARN ABOUT THE
SCIENCE OF SNOW.

197
00:15:17,862 --> 00:15:23,441
HELPING US TODAY ARE LONI AND
JOSH

198
00:15:23,441 --> 00:15:24,493
HI

199
00:15:24,493 --> 00:15:28,523
HAPPY HOLIDAYS, GUYS
LONI, WHAT'S YOUR FAVORITE
HOLIDAY TRADITION?

200
00:15:28,523 --> 00:15:31,676
- CHRISTMAS.
- OKAY.

201
00:15:31,677 --> 00:15:33,336
MYSELF

202
00:15:33,336 --> 00:15:36,147
WELL-- JOSH, WHAT DO YOU WANT
FOR CHRISTMAS?

203
00:15:36,147 --> 00:15:40,282
TO FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED TO MY BROTHER

204
00:15:44,091 --> 00:15:46,583
OKAY.
WELL, I WAS NOT EXPECTING THAT

205
00:15:46,583 --> 00:15:49,247
I THOUGHT YOU WOULD SAY YOU WANT
A SKATEBOARD OR SOMETHING,

206
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:51,695
BUT
I'M SURE YOUR BROTHER WILL BE
FINE

207
00:15:51,695 --> 00:15:54,200
LET'S TALK ABOUT SNOW.

208
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,473
WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT SNOW?

209
00:15:56,473 --> 00:16:01,749
FOR ONE, SNOW FORMS IN THE BIG
THINGS IN THE SKY CALLED--

210
00:16:01,749 --> 00:16:04,042
- LONI
- STARS.

211
00:16:04,042 --> 00:16:06,832
NO.
JOSH
STARTS WITH A C.

212
00:16:06,832 --> 00:16:09,240
SI, SENOR.

213
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:12,260
NO, THE LETTER
C. C-WORD

214
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:14,442
THE C WORD IS BAD.
CAN'T SAY THAT.

215
00:16:14,442 --> 00:16:17,322
NOT THE C WORD.

216
00:16:17,322 --> 00:16:20,888
IT'S BIG, IT'S WHITE IT'S PUFFY.

217
00:16:20,888 --> 00:16:22,118
MY DAD?

218
00:16:22,118 --> 00:16:25,811
CLOUDS.
SNOW FORMS INSIDE CLOUDS.

219
00:16:25,811 --> 00:16:29,724
LET'S THINK BEFORE WE ANSWER.

220
00:16:29,724 --> 00:16:34,157
NOW SNOW FORMS WHEN IT GETS SO
COLD THAT THE WATER VAPOR INSIDE A CLOUD

221
00:16:34,157 --> 00:16:37,278
- DOES WHAT, LONI?
- SNOWS.

222
00:16:37,278 --> 00:16:40,457
NO. IT'S HOW WATER TURNS INTO AN ICE.

223
00:16:40,538 --> 00:16:43,483
IT STARTS WITH AN F.
JOSH

224
00:16:43,483 --> 00:16:45,580
PHFOE SYNTHESIS.

225
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:48,265
WRONG

226
00:16:48,365 --> 00:16:49,695
STARTS WITH AN F--

227
00:16:49,695 --> 00:16:52,500
- FREE--
- BRITNEY

228
00:16:53,207 --> 00:16:56,624
GUYS, FREEZE. FREEZE.

229
00:16:56,684 --> 00:17:01,129
NO, YOU.THE WORD WAS FREEZE.

230
00:17:01,624 --> 00:17:06,334
JUST LIKE THERE ARE
RAINSTORMS, ALREADY ALSO SNOWSTORMS.

231
00:17:06,426 --> 00:17:07,537
TRUE.

232
00:17:07,537 --> 00:17:11,409
I WASN'T ASKING, BUT YES,
THAT IS TRUE.

233
00:17:11,409 --> 00:17:13,744
YOU DON'T HIGH FIVE EACH
OTHER BASED--

234
00:17:13,744 --> 00:17:15,467
DON'T FIST BUMP
EITHER

235
00:17:15,467 --> 00:17:17,336
STOP IT RIGHT NOW.

236
00:17:17,336 --> 00:17:21,447
FOR OUR EXPERIMENT TODAY,
WE'RE GOING TO MAKE OUR OWN SNOWSTORM.

237
00:17:21,447 --> 00:17:25,270
IT WILL OBVIOUSLY NOT BE AS BIG
AS A REAL ONE.

238
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:29,271
BUT EVEN IF SOMETHING'S SMALL,
IT CAN STILL--

239
00:17:29,271 --> 00:17:31,720
FEEL GOOD FOR THE GIRL?

240
00:17:38,321 --> 00:17:40,446
I DON'T FOLLOW THIS.

241
00:17:40,572 --> 00:17:45,000
BECAUSE MY SISTER TOLD ME
THAT EVEN IF THE GUY HAS A SMALL THING,

242
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,312
IT CAN STILL FEEL GOOD IF
THE GUY KNOWS WHAT HE'S DOING.

243
00:17:48,312 --> 00:17:51,872
NO.
IT'S TEACH A BIG LESSON.

244
00:17:51,872 --> 00:17:53,975
YOU WERE VERY, VERY WRONG.

245
00:17:53,975 --> 00:17:57,984
YOUR SISTER, HOWEVER, IS
VERY, VERY RIGHT

246
00:17:58,534 --> 00:18:01,406
NOW, TO DO THIS AT HOME,

247
00:18:01,406 --> 00:18:05,030
WE'LL NEED SOME WATER IN A GLASS, BABY OIL--

248
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:08,030
DON'T TOUCH THAT, PLEASE, GUYS.
STOP IT.

249
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:11,520
AND PAINT-- STOP TOUCHING
IT, PLEASE.

250
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,936
MAKE SURE TO HAVE A GROWN UP
HELP YOU FIRST
SAFETY FIRST.

251
00:18:14,936 --> 00:18:18,516
I HAVE A FUN SAFETY JOKE, JOSH

252
00:18:18,516 --> 00:18:20,100
- KNOCK, KNOCK.
- COME IN.

253
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:23,840
NO. JOSH
 YOU SAY,

254
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,973
 KNOCK, KNOCK, WHO'S
THERE.

255
00:18:25,973 --> 00:18:28,267
- KNOCK, KNOCK.
- WHO'S THERE

256
00:18:28,267 --> 00:18:30,123
- SAFETY. 
- HI. I'M JOSH.

257
00:18:30,123 --> 00:18:33,544
DO YOU NOT KNOW HOW THIS
WORKS?

258
00:18:33,544 --> 00:18:35,701
YOU SAY SAFETY WHO

259
00:18:35,701 --> 00:18:38,373
- KNOCK, KNOCK.
- SAFETY WHO.

260
00:18:43,958 --> 00:18:47,966
- ARE YOU OKAY, MR. SCIENCE
- I'M UPSET.

261
00:18:47,966 --> 00:18:53,016
- COME BACK, LITTLE BUDDY
COME BACK.
- BREATHE IN, BREATHE OUT

262
00:18:53,016 --> 00:18:57,507
WE PUT EVERYTHING INTO OUR GLASS
HERE EXCEPT THE ALKASELTZER

263
00:18:57,507 --> 00:19:02,141
DROP TO SIMULATE
 WHAT HAPPENS WHEN COLD
AIR MEETS WARM AIR

264
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:03,767
GET IN CLOSE, GUYS

265
00:19:03,767 --> 00:19:08,816
THREE, TWO, ONE, SCIENCE.

266
00:19:09,221 --> 00:19:12,516
JOSH, WHAT'S GOING ON?

267
00:19:12,516 --> 00:19:15,552
NOT MUCH.
WE HAVE TWO WEEKS OFF FOR WINTER BREAK.

268
00:19:15,552 --> 00:19:19,762
NOT IN YOUR LIFE.
IN HERE.
WHAT'S GOING ON IN HERE?

269
00:19:19,762 --> 00:19:22,192
DO YOU SEE WHAT I SEE?
WHAT DO YOU SEE?

270
00:19:22,192 --> 00:19:23,999
- YOUR FINGER
- NO.

271
00:19:23,999 --> 00:19:27,439
SOMETHING'S GOING ON
DO YOU SEE WHAT I SEE?

272
00:19:27,493 --> 00:19:32,395
♪ DO YOU SEE WHAT I SEE, A STAR
A STAR ♪

273
00:19:32,395 --> 00:19:34,878
SHUT UP, YOU IDIOTS

274
00:19:34,878 --> 00:19:37,981
LOOK WHAT WE'VE MADE
IT'S A WHAT?

275
00:19:37,981 --> 00:19:40,972
IT'S A ME, MARIO.

276
00:19:40,972 --> 00:19:43,981
NO.
IT'S NOT A ME MARIO.
GO TO COMMERCIAL.

277
00:19:43,981 --> 00:19:47,013
TURN THE CAMERA OFF
I'M GOING TO CHOKE THIS KID!

278
00:19:56,065 --> 00:19:58,811
CHELSEA?

279
00:19:59,077 --> 00:20:01,166
- YOUR EX CHELSEA
- YEAH.

280
00:20:01,166 --> 00:20:02,847
I HAVEN'T THOUGHT ABOUT HER
IN A WHILE.

281
00:20:02,919 --> 00:20:05,754
WHEN YOU GUYS BROKE UP, IT
WAS SUCH A RELIEF.

282
00:20:05,755 --> 00:20:08,620
- WORST
- SHE WAS SUCH A NEGATIVE PERSON.

283
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:11,852
- A BAD PERSON.
- WHENEVER SHE WOULD WALK INTO
A ROOM, IT WAS LIKE, 

284
00:20:11,852 --> 00:20:14,585
I GUESS
THIS ROOM IS GOING TO SUCK A
LITTLE BIT.

285
00:20:14,585 --> 00:20:17,834
I WOULD HAVE DAY TREATMENTS
OF HER BEING STEPD ON BY A GIANT.

286
00:20:17,834 --> 00:20:20,613
SHE WOULD ALWAYS HAVE FOOD ON
HER SHIRT LIKE A BABY.

287
00:20:20,613 --> 00:20:24,277
HOT DOG
 BELONG IN
MY NOUGT OR ON MY SHIRT.

288
00:20:24,278 --> 00:20:27,588
CHELSEA COOL
DEAD GUY

289
00:20:27,588 --> 00:20:29,853
SHE STUNG.
SHE WAS STINKY.

00:20:29,854 --> 00:20:32,554
PAWN
SLOPPY

291
00:20:32,554 --> 00:20:35,725
YEAH.
EWW, CHELSEA.

292
00:20:35,725 --> 00:20:39,022
- WHY?
WHAT'S GOING ON WITH CHELSEA

293
00:20:42,644 --> 00:20:45,327

294
00:20:47,199 --> 00:20:49,911
 CHELSEA.

295
00:20:49,911 --> 00:20:52,260
IT IS SO GOOD TO SEE YOU.
JOHN, WHAT THE HELL?

296
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:54,169
SO ARE YOU GUYS SERIOUS OR CASUAL

297
00:20:54,169 --> 00:20:56,609
JOHN JUST PROPOSED.
WEDDING IS IN JUNE.

298
00:20:56,609 --> 00:20:59,010
LOVE IT
CAN'T WAIT TO MEET THE FAMILIAR.

299
00:20:59,010 --> 00:21:01,752

THEY'RE ON ZOOM.

00:21:03,408 --> 00:21:06,843

- Y'ALL DON'T SEEM TOO HAPPY
WITH ME.

301
00:21:06,843 --> 00:21:09,035
ANYONE TALKS CRAP ABOUT MY
DAUGHTER, 

302
00:21:09,035 --> 00:21:11,593
I'LL HUNT YOU DOWN--

303
00:21:11,593 --> 00:21:12,625
TURN THAT OFF

304
00:21:12,625 --> 00:21:16,106
- YOU REMEMBER THAT STUFF WE WERE
TALKING ABOUT EARLIER?
- I DO.

305
00:21:16,106 --> 00:21:19,847
WE WERE TALKING ABOUT JOHN'S
OTHER EX COURTNEY.

306
00:21:19,847 --> 00:21:23,363
YES. COURTNEY WAS THE ONE WHO WAS
LIKE A FUGLY NERD.

307
00:21:23,363 --> 00:21:24,799

RIGHT NOW, BUT THERE'S NO PLACE

479
00:27:35,178 --> 00:27:43,520

480
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:46,623

482
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:46,623
THAT'S RIGHT.

483
00:27:46,623 --> 00:27:52,696
IT'S SPRINKLES, BUT SOMETIMES I

484
00:27:46,623 --> 00:27:52,696
GET EXCITED AND I SAY PRINGLES

485
00:27:46,623 --> 00:27:52,696
I DON'T KNOW

486
00:27:52,696 --> 00:27:58,902
I LIKE PRINGLES.

487
00:27:52,696 --> 00:27:58,902
I HAVE BEEN CALLING YOU

488
00:27:52,696 --> 00:27:58,902
SPRINKLES FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS.

489
00:27:58,902 --> 00:28:03,873
IT'S SPRINKLES.

490
00:27:58,902 --> 00:28:03,873

I LOVE YOU, SANTA.

499

OH, AND ALSO--

507
00:28:24,694 --> 00:28:29,566
THAT'S ENOUGH

508
00:28:24,694 --> 00:28:29,566
YOU ASK FOR TWO THINGS

509
00:28:29,566 --> 00:28:34,237
THAT'S ENOUGH.

510
00:28:29,566 --> 00:28:34,237
READ THE ROOM.

511
00:28:29,566 --> 00:28:34,237
BUT I WANT A RAINBOW DOLL.

512

00:28:34,237 --> 00:28:37,240
HE CAN'T DO IT.

515
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:42,045
OF COURSE I CAN DO IT

516
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:42,045

527
00:28:52,122 --> 00:28:59,629
MY MOM SAYS SOON I'LL BE TOO

528
00:28:52,122 --> 00:28:59,629
OLD TO COME SEE YOU. NONSENSE.

00:28:59,629 --> 00:29:06,536

THIS CRAZY OLD MAN IS

655
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:12,615
WHIPPING COINS INTO THE EYES OF ORPHANS.

656
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:12,615
I DIDN'T KNOW HE WAS AN

657
00:33:12,615 --> 00:33:19,155
ORPHAN.

658
00:33:12,615 --> 00:33:19,155
OH, YEAH, LIKE I LOOK LIKE I

660
00:33:19,155 --> 00:33:27,697
HEY, SCROOGE, JUST THOUGHT

HE'S BLINDING CHILDREN FOR SPORT.

665
00:33:32,068 --> 00:33:38,842
HE'S ALWAYS BEEN A CRUEL OLD MAN.

666
00:33:32,068 --> 00:33:38,842
LET ME GUESS, YOU TOSSED THE

667
00:33:38,842 --> 00:33:45,482
COIN WAY UP IN THE AIR, RIGHT?

668
00:33:38,842 --> 00:33:45,482
THAT'S A CLASSIC MISTAKE

669
00:33:38,842 --> 00:33:45,482
WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS TOSS THE

I COULDN'T SEE WHAT HAPPENED.

674
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:54,491
HE'S BLINDING THE WHOLE TOWN,

675
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:54,491
HE IS.

676

681
00:33:58,228 --> 00:34:06,503
YEAH, THEY CAN'T SEE ME

682
00:34:06,503 --> 00:34:15,211

MY NEW ADVICE IS LAWYER UP.

695

00:44:36,542 --> 00:44:39,668
AND I NEED TO DO IT FAST AND CRAZY.

806
00:44:39,668 --> 00:44:42,136
YOU EVER SEEN THE AISLES AND
CROSS DRESS FOR LESS

807
00:44:42,136 --> 00:44:45,796
YEAH.
RACK.
MOST OF THE MERCHANDISE IS ON
THE GROUND.

808
00:44:45,796 --> 00:44:48,160
YEAH, THAT'S ME, MICHAEL.

809
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:52,006
ME
EVERY SINGLE ROSS, THAT'S ALL
ME.

810
00:44:52,006 --> 00:44:55,406
SO YOU'RE SINGLE HANDEDLY
TRASHING ALL THE ROSSS

811
00:44:55,406 --> 00:44:58,876
YOU EVER TRIPPED OVER A PAIR
OF SHORTS

812
00:44:58,876 --> 00:45:01,440
STRUCK TO A WINNY THE
POOH TEAPOT?

813
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:03,460
THAT WAS ME, MICHAEL.

814
00:45:03,460 --> 00:45:06,625
- WHY MESS EVERYTHING UP?
- POWER, MICHAEL.

815
00:45:06,625 --> 00:45:09,118
I NEED TO LEAVE MY MARK.

816
00:45:09,118 --> 00:45:12,740
AND SOMETIMES, TO FIND THAT ONE
PERFECT SHIRT,

817
00:45:12,740 --> 00:45:16,182
YOU HAVE TO
UNFOLD 40 AND DUMP THEM ALL ON
THE FLOOR.

818
00:45:16,182 --> 00:45:19,635
ALL RIGHT
WELL, YOU'RE HERE TO GIVE US
SOME HOLIDAY SHOPPING TIPS.

819
00:45:19,704 --> 00:45:22,186
THAT'S RIGHT.
TIP NUMBER ONE

820
00:45:22,186 --> 00:45:24,288
GET YOU ONE OF THESE

821
00:45:24,288 --> 00:45:28,106
DID YOU KNOW ANYONE CAN BUY A
NECK BRACE

822
00:45:28,106 --> 00:45:29,973
YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE TO GO TO A DOCTOR

823
00:45:29,973 --> 00:45:32,375
THESE THINGS MAKE PEOPLE STAY
OUT OF YOUR WAY.

824
00:45:32,375 --> 00:45:37,484
THEY THINK YOU'RE WOUNDED, BUT
ONLY YOU KNOW, YOUR NECK IS
STRONG AS HELL

825
00:45:37,846 --> 00:45:41,757
NOW, MICHAEL, GUESS HOW MUCH ALL
THESE SANTA PLATES WERE?

826
00:45:41,757 --> 00:45:43,423
- WHAT?
- $3.

827
00:45:43,423 --> 00:45:46,779
GUESS HOW MUCH THIS SHIRT WAS.

828
00:45:46,779 --> 00:45:49,514
- I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE--
- $3.

829
00:45:49,514 --> 00:45:51,432
- YOU WANT TO SEE HOW I GOT IT
- SURE.

830
00:45:51,432 --> 00:45:55,356
SO HOLD THIS, AND PRETEND YOU'RE
A CUSTOMER LOOKING AT IT.

831
00:45:55,356 --> 00:45:57,480
AIN'T THAT A LOVELY BLOUSE.

832
00:45:57,480 --> 00:46:01,418
GIVE ME THAT DAMN SHIRT
THAT WAS IN MY BASKET!

833
00:46:01,418 --> 00:46:05,030
THAT WAS INTENSE.

834
00:46:05,030 --> 00:46:08,756
I SEE HOW THAT WORKS FOR YOU
BUT DO YOU HAVE ANY OTHER TIPS

835
00:46:08,756 --> 00:46:12,156
TIP NUMBER TWO, IF YOUR BLOOD
ISSUING GAR DROPS,

836
00:46:12,156 --> 00:46:14,936
J.C. PENNY
GOT NUGGETS.

837
00:46:14,936 --> 00:46:16,966
WHAT?

838
00:46:16,966 --> 00:46:21,219
J.C. PENNY GOT CHICKEN
NUGGETS.

839
00:46:21,219 --> 00:46:25,487
ALL YOU GOT TO DO IS GET
YOURSELF STUCK TOEN THAT
ESCALATOR, MAKE A FUSS,

840
00:46:25,487 --> 00:46:28,874
AND THE
MANAGER WILL FIND YOU SOME
NUGGETS, OKAY?

841
00:46:28,874 --> 00:46:32,868
- ARE YOU ALL RIGHT
- NO, MICHAEL
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU TALKING
ABOUT?

842
00:46:32,868 --> 00:46:35,145
I KNOW TOO MUCH.
I'VE SEEN TOO MUCH

843
00:46:35,145 --> 00:46:52,402
IT'S A WAR ZONE OUT THERE, AND I

844
00:46:45,061 --> 00:46:52,402
JUST GOT DONE DOING THREE TOURS

845
00:46:45,061 --> 00:46:52,402
IN NORDSTROM IRAQ.

846
00:46:52,402 --> 00:46:56,373
IT'S JUST A DEPARTMENT STORE.

847
00:46:52,402 --> 00:46:56,373
IT'S NOT THAT SERIOUS.

848
00:46:52,402 --> 00:46:56,373
YOU HAVE NO IDEA.

849
00:46:56,373 --> 00:47:01,077
I'M THE ONE OUT HERE ON THESE

850
00:46:56,373 --> 00:47:01,077
FRONT LINES.

851
00:46:56,373 --> 00:47:01,077
NOW, MY THIRD AND FINAL TIP--

852
00:47:01,077 --> 00:47:06,149
AND I SHOULDN'T HAVE TO SAY

853
00:47:01,077 --> 00:47:06,149
THIS, BUT IF YOU CAN, BE BLACK

854
00:47:01,077 --> 00:47:06,149
BECAUSE IF YOU'RE WHITE ACTING

855
00:47:06,149 --> 00:47:10,587
LIKE THIS, SOMEONE WILL TAKE A

856
00:47:06,149 --> 00:47:10,587
VIDEO, AND YOU WILL LOSE YOUR JOB.

857
00:47:10,587 --> 00:47:16,192
OKAY

858
00:47:10,587 --> 00:47:16,192
YOU SEE, MICHAEL, THERE'S NO

859
00:47:10,587 --> 00:47:16,192
SUCH THING AS A BLACK KAREN.

860
00:47:16,192 --> 00:47:20,463
I COULD SLAP THE HELL OUT OF YOU

861
00:47:16,192 --> 00:47:20,463
RIGHT NOW, AND NOBODY WOULD SAY

862
00:47:16,192 --> 00:47:20,463
A WORD

863
00:47:20,463 --> 00:47:25,035
MY JOB IS SAFE.

864
00:47:20,463 --> 00:47:25,035
WHAT DO YOU EVEN DO FOR WORK?

865
00:47:20,463 --> 00:47:25,035
I SUE THE CITY.

866
00:47:25,035 --> 00:47:31,041
THE CITY HAS A LOT OF MONEY AND

867
00:47:25,035 --> 00:47:31,041
A BUNCH OF UNEVEN SIDEWALKS, BABY

868
00:47:31,041 --> 00:47:33,443
OKAY

869
00:47:31,041 --> 00:47:33,443
MARY ANN LOUISE FISHER, EVERYBODY.

870
00:47:33,443 --> 00:47:36,780
I GOT YOU SOM

871
00:47:33,443 --> 00:47:36,780
IT'S IN HERE SOMEWHERE.

872
00:47:33,443 --> 00:47:36,780
I'M GOOD.

873
00:47:36,780 --> 00:47:37,847
IT'S IN HERE SOMEWHERE.

874
00:47:36,780 --> 00:47:37,847
I'M GOOD.

875
00:47:36,780 --> 00:47:37,847
IT'S OKAY.

876
00:47:43,853 --> 00:47:51,695
FLIGHT TO NEWARK AFTER SHE

877
00:47:43,853 --> 00:47:51,695
ACCUSED A FAMILY OF SMUGGLING

878
00:47:43,853 --> 00:47:51,695
COCAINE THEN ASSAULTED MULTIPLE

879
00:47:51,695 --> 00:47:56,866
OFFICERS BY BITING THEM AND

880
00:47:51,695 --> 00:47:56,866
KICKING THEM IN THE GROIN.

881
00:47:51,695 --> 00:47:56,866
SHE'S BEEN SENTENCED TO LIFE IN

882
00:47:56,866 --> 00:48:07,911
THE NEW JERSEY HALL OF FAME.

883
00:47:56,866 --> 00:48:07,911
A NEW ALBUM FROM R. KELLY WAS

884
00:47:56,866 --> 00:48:07,911
REMOVED FROM A STREAMING ALBUM

885
00:48:07,911 --> 00:48:14,084
MINUTES AFTER IT WAS UPLOADED.

886
00:48:07,911 --> 00:48:14,084
IT WAS NOT EASY TO REMOVE HIS

887
00:48:07,911 --> 00:48:14,084
STREAMS, SAID THE MAID WHO

888
00:48:14,084 --> 00:48:19,789
CLEANED HIS HOUSE.

889
00:48:14,084 --> 00:48:19,789
ON CHRISTMAS.

890
00:48:14,084 --> 00:48:19,789
THE LOS ANGELES ZOO ANNOUNCED

891
00:48:19,789 --> 00:48:30,033
THAT EVYLYN HAS BEEN EUTHANIZED,

892
00:48:19,789 --> 00:48:30,033
NOT BECAUSE SHE'S SICK BUT

893
00:48:19,789 --> 00:48:30,033
BECAUSE IT'S LA AND SHE'S IN HER

894
00:48:30,033 --> 00:48:32,635
40s.

895
00:48:30,033 --> 00:48:32,635
DAMN

896
00:48:30,033 --> 00:48:32,635
THIS WILL GET YOU BACK

897
00:48:32,635 --> 00:48:39,476
A WOMAN IN TEXAS ALLEGEDLY

898
00:48:32,635 --> 00:48:39,476
DUMPED THREE BUCKETS OF HUMAN

899

WASTE IN FRONT OF A POLICE

900
00:48:39,476 --> 00:48:48,551
DEPARTMENT AND DROVE AWAY.

901
00:48:39,476 --> 00:48:48,551
IT'S A RARE CASE OF E RADIC

902
00:48:39,476 --> 00:48:48,551
BEHAVIOR FROM A LADY WHO POOPS

903
00:48:48,551 --> 00:48:55,058
IN A BUCKET.

904
00:48:48,551 --> 00:48:55,058
AS DIS-TURK AS THIS STORY IS,

905
00:48:48,551 --> 00:48:55,058
IT'S NOT AS DISTURBING AS

906
00:48:55,058 --> 00:49:00,597
IMAGINING THE WOMAN'S DRIVE TO

907
00:48:55,058 --> 00:49:00,597
THE POLICE STATION WITH FULL

908

SO SORT OF LIKE ROLE PLAYING?

930
00:49:54,317 --> 00:49:59,122
YEAH, BUT WITH CELEBRITIES.

931
