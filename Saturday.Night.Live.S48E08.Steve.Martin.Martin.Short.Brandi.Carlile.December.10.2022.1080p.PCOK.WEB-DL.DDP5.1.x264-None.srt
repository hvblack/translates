TO PREPARE FOR THE EVENING'S
PERFORMANCE.

126
00:10:21,273 --> 00:10:22,454
WE WERE DOING IT BACKSTAGE,

127
00:10:22,454 --> 00:10:26,089
AND I NOTICED ONE OF THE BACK STAGE
CREW WAS VIDEO TAPING US,

128
00:10:26,089 --> 00:10:29,400
AND I
THOUGHT, THAT WOULD BE
INTERESTING TO SHOW THE AUDIENCE

129
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:33,016
SO HERE IS MARTY AND I GETTING
READY FOR TONIGHT'S SHOW.

130
00:10:36,332 --> 00:10:38,172
AND CAN I SAY, STEVE--

131
00:10:38,172 --> 00:10:40,153
LET THEM LAUGH.

132
00:10:40,864 --> 00:10:44,799

133
00:10:44,799 --> 00:10:47,479
AND I HOPE WE CAN DO THIS
FOREVER.

134
00:10:47,479 --> 00:10:52,524
OF COURSE I THOUGHT ABOUT
THAT, BUT I REALIZED YOU'RE NOT
GOING TO LIVE FOREVER,

135
00:10:52,524 --> 00:10:57,163
AND THAT
IS SAD BECAUSE YOU WON'T BE ABLE

136
00:10:57,163 --> 00:10:59,355
I'M
GOING TO SAY AT YOUR MEMORIAL.

137
00:10:59,355 --> 00:11:01,350
SO I THOUGHT, WHY WAIT

138
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:05,857
SO WHAT I DID WAS I WROTE UP
YOUR EULOGY

139
00:11:05,857 --> 00:11:07,230
SO YOU CAN HEAR IT NOW.

140
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:10,194
THAT IS SUCH A COINCIDENCE
BECAUSE

141
00:11:10,194 --> 00:11:12,514
I DID THE SAME THING
I WROTE YOUR EULOGY.

142
00:11:12,514 --> 00:11:13,501
REALLY?

143
00:11:13,501 --> 00:11:15,242
- LET'S READ THEM TOGETHER
- WHY NOT.

144
00:11:15,242 --> 00:11:17,824
THIS IS A SAD MOMENT.

145
00:11:17,824 --> 00:11:21,090
CAN YOU PLAY SOMETHING SAD FOR
US, PLEASE

146
00:11:22,608 --> 00:11:26,931
NOT SAD ENOUGH.
ANYTHING SADDER?

147
00:11:29,728 --> 00:11:34,380
NO, NO, NO.
DO YOU HAVE SOMETHING REALLY,
REALLY SAD

148
00:11:44,854 --> 00:11:50,292
SO, MARTY, I DEDICATE THIS
EULOGY TO YOU.

149
00:11:50,292 --> 00:11:53,635
WOW, NOT MUCH OF A TURNOUT

WHITE HAIRED SON OF A BITCH.
WHERE DID YOU GO

157
00:12:33,217 --> 00:12:35,747
I KNOW STEVE IS LOOKING DOWN ON
US RIGHT NOW

158
00:12:35,747 --> 00:12:38,509
BECAUSE HE ALWAYS
LOOKED DOWN ON EVERYBODY

159
00:12:39,832 --> 00:12:42,699
AND YES, I LEARNED SO MUCH FROM
STEVE.

160
00:12:42,699 --> 00:12:46,016
FOR EXAMPLE, HE TAUGHT ME YOU
DON'T NEED TO RESTRICT A URINAL

161
00:12:46,016 --> 00:12:48,518
TO JUST NUMBER ONE

162
00:12:53,656 --> 00:12:57,544
EVEN AT THE END, MARTY HAD A
WONDERFUL GIRLFRIEND

163
00:12:57,544 --> 00:13:02,445
SMART, BEAUTIFUL, AND SO REALISTIC.

164
00:13:04,381 --> 00:13:07,061
BUT MARTY WAS ALWAYS SEXUALLY ACTIVE

165
00:13:07,061 --> 00:13:10,448
AS LONG AS THERE WERE
BATTERIES IN THE HOUSE

166
00:13:10,448 --> 00:13:13,711
BUT MARTY WAS TAKEN AWAY FROM US
TOO SOON

167
00:13:13,711 --> 00:13:19,005
BUT SADLY, NOT BEFORE HE PLAYED
JACK FROST IN "SANTA CLAUS 3".

168
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:23,283
OH, STEVE

169
00:13:23,283 --> 00:13:27,839
OH, STEVE, IT'S SO HARD TO
LOOK AT YOU IN THAT OPEN CASKET,

170
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:31,361
MOTIONLESS, COLORLESS, STIFF,

171
00:13:31,361 --> 00:13:33,777
SO LIFE LIKE.

172
00:13:34,013 --> 00:13:39,539
AND YET, SEEING YOU IN YOUR
CASKET REMINDS ME OF THAT
CLASSIC SNL SKETCH,

173
00:13:39,539 --> 00:13:42,167
DICK IN A BOX.

174
00:13:46,224 --> 00:13:48,304
THANK YOU.

175
00:13:48,862 --> 00:13:51,574
THE GOOD NEWS IS WITH STEVE
GONE,

176
00:13:51,574 --> 00:13:55,651
DOWNLOADS SHOULD BE SO
MUCH FASTER ON PORN HUB.

177
00:13:55,983 --> 00:13:59,231
PEOPLE ALWAYS ASK ME WHAT STEVE
WAS REALLY LIKE,

178
00:13:59,231 --> 00:14:02,060
AND I WOULD
SAY, I DON'T KNOW, YOU'RE HIS WIFE

179
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:03,910
AND HE'S SUCH A GREAT DAD,

180
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:06,854
AND
YOU CAN TELL THAT FROM HIS CHILDREN
THEY'RE SO POLITE.

181
00:14:06,927 --> 00:14:10,980
YOU GO TO HIS HOUSE AND THEY
SAY, WOULD YOU LIKE ANYTHING,
MR. SHORT?

182
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:13,190
CAN I GET YOU A DRINK,
MR. SHORT?

183
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:17,850
CAN YOU GIVE THIS NOTE TO THE
POLICE, MR. SHORT?

184
00:14:18,342 --> 00:14:22,641
NOW THAT MARTY IS GONE, WHO
WILL I EVER WORK WITH?

185
00:14:22,641 --> 00:14:24,408
HOW ABOUT ME?

186
00:14:28,932 --> 00:14:32,078
WE HAVE A GREAT SHOW

187
00:14:32,078 --> 00:14:33,468
STICK

188
00:14:33,468 --> 00:14:35,353
BYE

189
00:14:40,561 --> 00:14:41,909
PBS

190
00:14:41,909 --> 00:14:45,472
CURIOUS GEORGE

191
00:14:45,472 --> 00:14:48,207
SCIENCE ROOM

192
00:14:56,285 --> 00:15:00,743
CHEMISTRY,

193
00:15:00,743 --> 00:15:05,375
HOW LOVELY ARE THY
IONS ♪

194
00:15:05,375 --> 00:15:09,596
I LOVE THAT SONG SO MUCH.

195
00:15:09,596 --> 00:15:13,159
- HEY, KIDS, I'M DR. SCIENCE.
- AND I'M MR. SCIENCE.

196
00:15:13,159 --> 00:15:17,862
AND WHAT BETTER TIME THAN THE
HOLIDAYS TO LEARN ABOUT THE
SCIENCE OF SNOW.

197
00:15:17,862 --> 00:15:23,441
HELPING US TODAY ARE LONI AND
JOSH

198
00:15:23,441 --> 00:15:24,493
HI

199
00:15:24,493 --> 00:15:28,523
HAPPY HOLIDAYS, GUYS
LONI, WHAT'S YOUR FAVORITE
HOLIDAY TRADITION?

200
00:15:28,523 --> 00:15:31,676
- CHRISTMAS.
- OKAY.

201
00:15:31,677 --> 00:15:33,336
MYSELF

202
00:15:33,336 --> 00:15:36,147
WELL-- JOSH, WHAT DO YOU WANT
FOR CHRISTMAS?

203
00:15:36,147 --> 00:15:40,282
TO FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED TO MY BROTHER

204
00:15:44,091 --> 00:15:46,583
OKAY.
WELL, I WAS NOT EXPECTING THAT

205
00:15:46,583 --> 00:15:49,247
I THOUGHT YOU WOULD SAY YOU WANT
A SKATEBOARD OR SOMETHING,

206
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:51,695
BUT
I'M SURE YOUR BROTHER WILL BE
FINE

207
00:15:51,695 --> 00:15:54,200
LET'S TALK ABOUT SNOW.

208
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,473
WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT SNOW?

209
00:15:56,473 --> 00:16:01,749
FOR ONE, SNOW FORMS IN THE BIG
THINGS IN THE SKY CALLED--

210
00:16:01,749 --> 00:16:04,042
- LONI
- STARS.

211
00:16:04,042 --> 00:16:06,832
NO.
JOSH
STARTS WITH A C.

212
00:16:06,832 --> 00:16:09,240
SI, SENOR.

213
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:12,260
NO, THE LETTER
C. C-WORD

214
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:14,442
THE C WORD IS BAD.
CAN'T SAY THAT.

215
00:16:14,442 --> 00:16:17,322
NOT THE C WORD.

216
00:16:17,322 --> 00:16:20,888
IT'S BIG, IT'S WHITE IT'S PUFFY.

217
00:16:20,888 --> 00:16:22,118
MY DAD?

218
00:16:22,118 --> 00:16:25,811
CLOUDS.
SNOW FORMS INSIDE CLOUDS.

219
00:16:25,811 --> 00:16:29,724
LET'S THINK BEFORE WE ANSWER.

220
00:16:29,724 --> 00:16:34,157
NOW SNOW FORMS WHEN IT GETS SO
COLD THAT THE WATER VAPOR INSIDE A CLOUD

221
00:16:34,157 --> 00:16:37,278
- DOES WHAT, LONI?
- SNOWS.

222
00:16:37,278 --> 00:16:40,457
NO. IT'S HOW WATER TURNS INTO AN ICE.

223
00:16:40,538 --> 00:16:43,483
IT STARTS WITH AN F.
JOSH

224
00:16:43,483 --> 00:16:45,580
PHFOE SYNTHESIS.

225
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:48,265
WRONG

226
00:16:48,365 --> 00:16:49,695
STARTS WITH AN F-- 

227
00:16:49,695 --> 00:16:52,500
- FREE--
- BRITNEY

228
00:16:53,207 --> 00:16:56,624
GUYS, FREEZE. FREEZE.

229
00:16:56,684 --> 00:17:01,129
NO, YOU.THE WORD WAS FREEZE.

230
00:17:01,624 --> 00:17:06,334
JUST LIKE THERE ARE
RAINSTORMS, ALREADY ALSO SNOWSTORMS.

231
00:17:06,426 --> 00:17:07,537
TRUE.

232
00:17:07,537 --> 00:17:11,409
I WASN'T ASKING, BUT YES,
THAT IS TRUE.

233
00:17:11,409 --> 00:17:13,744
YOU DON'T HIGH FIVE EACH
OTHER BASED--

234
00:17:13,744 --> 00:17:15,467
 DON'T FIST BUMP
EITHER

235
00:17:15,467 --> 00:17:17,336
STOP IT RIGHT NOW.

236
00:17:17,336 --> 00:17:21,447
FOR OUR EXPERIMENT TODAY,
WE'RE GOING TO MAKE OUR OWN SNOWSTORM.

237
00:17:21,447 --> 00:17:25,270
IT WILL OBVIOUSLY NOT BE AS BIG
AS A REAL ONE.

238
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:29,271
BUT EVEN IF SOMETHING'S SMALL,
IT CAN STILL--

239
00:17:29,271 --> 00:17:31,720
FEEL GOOD FOR THE GIRL?

240
00:17:38,321 --> 00:17:40,446
I DON'T FOLLOW THIS.

241
00:17:40,572 --> 00:17:45,000
BECAUSE MY SISTER TOLD ME
THAT EVEN IF THE GUY HAS A SMALL THING, 

242
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,312
IT CAN STILL FEEL GOOD IF
THE GUY KNOWS WHAT HE'S DOING.

243
00:17:48,312 --> 00:17:51,872
NO.
IT'S TEACH A BIG LESSON.

244
00:17:51,872 --> 00:17:53,975
YOU WERE VERY, VERY WRONG.

245
00:17:53,975 --> 00:17:57,984
YOUR SISTER, HOWEVER, IS
VERY, VERY RIGHT

246
00:17:58,534 --> 00:18:01,406
NOW, TO DO THIS AT HOME, 

247
00:18:01,406 --> 00:18:05,030
WE'LL NEED SOME WATER IN A GLASS, BABY OIL-- 

248
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:08,030
DON'T TOUCH THAT, PLEASE, GUYS.
STOP IT.

249
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:11,520
AND PAINT-- STOP TOUCHING
IT, PLEASE.

250
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,936
MAKE SURE TO HAVE A GROWN UP
HELP YOU FIRST
SAFETY FIRST.

251
00:18:14,936 --> 00:18:18,516
I HAVE A FUN SAFETY JOKE, JOSH

252
00:18:18,516 --> 00:18:20,100
- KNOCK, KNOCK.
- COME IN.

253
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:31,267
 NO. JOSH

254
00:18:31,267 --> 00:18:35,839
YOU SAY, KNOCK, KNOCK, WHO'S

255
00:18:31,267 --> 00:18:35,839
THERE.

256
00:18:31,267 --> 00:18:35,839
KNOCK, KNOCK.

257
00:18:35,839 --> 00:18:39,275
WHO'S THERE SAFETY. HI.

258
00:18:39,275 --> 00:18:42,779
I'M JOSH.

259
00:18:39,275 --> 00:18:42,779
DO YOU NOT KNOW HOW THIS

260
00:18:39,275 --> 00:18:42,779
WORKS?

261
00:18:42,779 --> 00:18:49,719
YOU SAY SAFETY WHO

262
00:18:42,779 --> 00:18:49,719
KNOCK, KNOCK.

263
00:18:42,779 --> 00:18:49,719
SAFETY WHO.

264
00:18:49,719 --> 00:18:55,525
OH, GAH

265
00:18:49,719 --> 00:18:55,525
ARE YOU OKAY, MR. SCIENCE

266
00:18:49,719 --> 00:18:55,525
I'M UPSET.

267
00:18:55,525 --> 00:19:00,196
COME BACK, LITTLE BUDDY

268
00:18:55,525 --> 00:19:00,196
COME BACK.

269
00:18:55,525 --> 00:19:00,196
BREATHE IN, BREATHE OUT

270
00:19:00,196 --> 00:19:12,809
OKAY.

271
00:19:00,196 --> 00:19:12,809
WE PUT EVERYTHING INTO OUR GLASS

272
00:19:00,196 --> 00:19:12,809
HERE EXCEPT THE ALKASELTZER TO

273
00:19:12,809 --> 00:19:18,548
SHOW YOU WHAT HAPPENS WHEN COLD

274
00:19:12,809 --> 00:19:18,548
AIR MEETS WARM AIR

275
00:19:12,809 --> 00:19:18,548
GET IN CLOSE, GUYS

276
00:19:18,548 --> 00:19:21,851
THREE, TWO, ONE, SCIENCE. WOW

277
00:19:18,548 --> 00:19:21,851
JOSH, WHAT'S GOING ON?

278
00:19:21,851 --> 00:19:25,889
NOT MUCH.

279
00:19:21,851 --> 00:19:25,889
WE HAVE TWO WEEKS OFF FOR WINTER BREAK.

280
00:19:25,889 --> 00:19:29,492
NOT IN YOUR LIFE.

281
00:19:25,889 --> 00:19:29,492
IN HERE.

282
00:19:25,889 --> 00:19:29,492
WHAT'S GOING ON IN HERE?

283
00:19:29,492 --> 00:19:33,463
DO YOU SEE WHAT I SEE?

284
00:19:29,492 --> 00:19:33,463
WHAT DO YOU SEE?

285
00:19:29,492 --> 00:19:33,463
YOUR FINGER

286
00:19:33,463 --> 00:19:37,901
NO.

287
00:19:33,463 --> 00:19:37,901
SOMETHING'S GOING ON

288
00:19:33,463 --> 00:19:37,901
DO YOU SEE WHAT I SEE?

289
00:19:37,901 --> 00:19:44,507
♪ DO YOU SEE WHAT I SEE, A STAR

290
00:19:37,901 --> 00:19:44,507
A STAR ♪

291
00:19:37,901 --> 00:19:44,507
SHUT UP, YOU IDIOTS

292
00:19:44,507 --> 00:19:49,713
LOOK WHAT WE'VE MADE

293
00:19:44,507 --> 00:19:49,713
IT'S A WHAT?

294
00:19:44,507 --> 00:19:49,713
IT'S A ME, MARIO.

295
00:19:49,713 --> 00:19:52,816
NO.

296
00:19:49,713 --> 00:19:52,816
IT'S NOT A ME MARIO.

297
00:19:52,816 --> 00:19:59,823
GO TO COMMERCIAL.

298
00:19:52,816 --> 00:19:59,823
TURN THE CAMERA OFF

299
00:19:52,816 --> 00:19:59,823
I'M GOING TO CHOKE THIS KID!

300
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:11,167
CHELSEA?

301
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:11,167
YOUR EX CHELSEA YEAH.

302
00:20:11,167 --> 00:20:15,505
I HAVEN'T THOUGHT ABOUT HER

303
00:20:11,167 --> 00:20:15,505
IN A WHILE.

304
00:20:11,167 --> 00:20:15,505
WHEN YOU GUYS BROKE UP, IT

305
00:20:15,505 --> 00:20:19,709
WAS SUCH A RELIEF.

306
00:20:15,505 --> 00:20:19,709
SHE WAS SUCH A NEGATIVE PERSON.

307
00:20:19,709 --> 00:20:24,914
A BAD PERSON.

308
00:20:19,709 --> 00:20:24,914
WHENEVER SHE WOULD WALK INTO

309
00:20:19,709 --> 00:20:24,914
A ROOM, IT WAS LIKE, I GUESS

310
00:20:24,914 --> 00:20:28,151
THIS ROOM IS GOING TO SUCK A

311
00:20:24,914 --> 00:20:28,151
LITTLE BIT.

312
00:20:24,914 --> 00:20:28,151
I WOULD HAVE DAY TREATMENTS

313
00:20:28,151 --> 00:20:32,022
OF HER BEING STEPD ON BY A GIANT.

314
00:20:28,151 --> 00:20:32,022
SHE WOULD ALWAYS HAVE FOOD ON

315
00:20:32,022 --> 00:20:38,995
HER SHIRT LIKE A BABY.

316
00:20:32,022 --> 00:20:38,995

00:26:29,045 --> 00:26:34,317
BREAK THE SPELL.

489
00:26:29,045 --> 00:26:34,317
WHAT SPELL?

490
00:26:34,317 --> 00:26:38,088
OH, WE WON'T GET OUR

491
00:26:34,317 --> 00:26:38,088
CHRISTMAS WISH

WHAT WISH

494
00:26:38,088 --> 00:26:42,292
I WAS REALLY HOPING THEY

495
00:26:38,088 --> 00:26:42,292
WOULD MAKE IT THIS TIME.

496
00:26:42,292 --> 00:26:48,765
THOSE BEARS MAKE THE SAME

497
00:26:42,292 --> 00:26:48,765
CHRISTMAS WISH EVERY YEAR, TO

498
00:26:42,292 --> 00:26:48,765
TURN INTO HUMANS AND RIDE THE

499
00:26:48,765 --> 00:26:54,270
TRAIN TO BUFFALO TO SEE SNOW

500
00:26:48,765 --> 00:26:54,270
BUT THEY ALWAYS FALL ASLEEP AND HIBERNATE.

501
00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:59,275
BEAR SNS WHAT ARE YOU

502
00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:59,275

00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:59,275
WAKE UP!

504
00:26:59,275 --> 00:27:04,080
IT'S SNOWING OUTSIDE.

505
00:26:59,275 --> 00:27:04,080
DON'T WAKE THEM UP.

506
00:26:59,275 --> 00:27:04,080
ARE YOU INSANE

507
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:07,484
THEY'LL KILL US.

508
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:07,484
THEY'RE BEARS.

509
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:07,484
GOOD POINT.

510
00:27:07,484 --> 00:27:15,892
WELL, MERRY CHRISTMAS, BEARS

511
00:27:07,484 --> 00:27:15,892
OH, NUTS.

512
00:27:07,484 --> 00:27:15,892
THOSE ARE OURS!

513
00:27:20,497 --> 00:27:32,942
>>> CHILDREN OF ALL AGES, YOU'VE

514
00:27:20,497 --> 00:27:32,942
COME TO THE RIGHT PLACE.

515
00:27:20,497 --> 00:27:32,942
THE ACTUAL MR. CHRIS CRINGLE HAS

516
00:27:32,942 --> 00:27:35,178
COME ALL THE WAY FROM THE NORTH POLE.

517
00:27:32,942 --> 00:27:35,178
THAT'S RIGHT.

518
00:27:35,178 --> 00:27:43,520
MY SCHEDULE IS A LITTLE CRAZY

519
00:27:35,178 --> 00:27:43,520
RIGHT NOW, BUT THERE'S NO PLACE

520
00:27:35,178 --> 00:27:43,520
I WOULD RATHER BE.

521
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:46,623
RI

522
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:46,623
RIGHT?

523
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:46,623
THAT'S RIGHT.

524
00:27:46,623 --> 00:27:52,696
IT'S SPRINKLES, BUT SOMETIMES I

525
00:27:46,623 --> 00:27:52,696
GET EXCITED AND I SAY PRINGLES

526
00:27:46,623 --> 00:27:52,696
I DON'T KNOW

527
00:27:52,696 --> 00:27:58,902
I LIKE PRINGLES.

528
00:27:52,696 --> 00:27:58,902
I HAVE BEEN CALLING YOU

529
00:27:52,696 --> 00:27:58,902
SPRINKLES FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS.

530
00:27:58,902 --> 00:28:03,873
IT'S SPRINKLES.

531
00:27:58,902 --> 00:28:03,873
I MADE A MISTAKE

532
00:27:58,902 --> 00:28:03,873
DROP IT!

533
00:28:03,873 --> 00:28:06,276
OKAY.

534
00:28:03,873 --> 00:28:06,276
SORRY.

535
00:28:03,873 --> 00:28:06,276
WHO'S FIRST.

536
00:28:06,276 --> 00:28:10,246
THIS IS PENNY

537
00:28:06,276 --> 00:28:10,246
SHE'S NINE

538
00:28:06,276 --> 00:28:10,246
SHE'S YOUR BIGGEST FAN.

539
00:28:10,246 --> 00:28:15,785
I LOVE YOU, SANTA.

540
00:28:10,246 --> 00:28:15,785
THAT'S SWEET.

541
00:28:10,246 --> 00:28:15,785

546
00:28:23,159 --> 00:28:24,694
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO HAVE THAT.

547
00:28:24,694 --> 00:28:29,566
OH, AND ALSO--

548
00:28:24,694 --> 00:28:29,566
THAT'S ENOUGH

549
00:28:24,694 --> 00:28:29,566
YOU ASK FOR TWO THINGS

550
00:28:29,566 --> 00:28:34,237
THAT'S ENOUGH.

551
00:28:29,566 --> 00:28:34,237
READ THE ROOM.

552
00:28:29,566 --> 00:28:34,237
BUT I WANT A RAINBOW DOLL.

553
00:28:34,237 --> 00:28:37,240
I SAID NO

IT'S TOO MUCH.

555
00:28:34,237 --> 00:28:37,240
HE CAN'T DO IT.

556
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:42,045
OF COURSE I CAN DO IT

557
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:42,045
I'M SANTA.

558
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:42,045

568
00:28:52,122 --> 00:28:59,629
MY MOM SAYS SOON I'LL BE TOO

569
00:28:52,122 --> 00:28:59,629
OLD TO COME SEE YOU. NONSENSE.

570
00:28:59,629 --> 00:29:06,536

571
00:28:59,629 --> 00:29:06,536

576
00:29:13,510 --> 00:29:15,512
WHAT?

577
00:29:13,510 --> 00:29:15,512
HE CANNOT OPERATE ON THIS LEVEL.

578
00:29:15,512 --> 00:29:22,185

00:29:22,185 --> 00:29:26,623
OF COURSE I DO.

I'M NOT SURE THIS IS A GOOD

597
00:29:47,344 --> 00:29:53,950
IDEA, BUT THIS IS AMANDA

598
00:29:47,344 --> 00:29:53,950

CAN I TALK WITH YOU

608
00:30:08,298 --> 00:30:12,035
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

609
00:30:08,298 --> 00:30:12,035
YOU'RE JUST SAYING YES TO EVERYTHING.

610
00:30:12,035 --> 00:30:18,708
BUT I LOVE CHILDREN.

611
00:30:12,035 --> 00:30:18,708
THERE ARE 2 BILLION OF THEM,

612
00:30:12,035 --> 00:30:18,708

613
00:30:18,708 --> 00:30:24,214

00:30:18,708 --> 00:30:24,214
CALM DOWN.

616
00:30:24,214 --> 00:30:30,353

617
00:30:24,214 --> 00:30:30,353
PULL IT OFF, BUT WE ALWAYS DO.

618
00:30:24,214 --> 00:30:30,353

VITAMIN THAT MAKES YOU GO FASTER

627
00:30:41,398 --> 00:30:46,503

628
00:30:41,398 --> 00:30:46,503
TO GET SOME.

629
00:30:41,398 --> 00:30:46,503
CAN'T YOU ASK ONE OF THE KIDS

630
00:30:46,503 --> 00:30:51,775
IF THEY HAVE ANYTHING.

631
00:30:46,503 --> 00:30:51,775
I'M NOT ALLOWED TO ASK THEM

632
00:30:46,503 --> 00:30:51,775

YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT SPEED?

639
00:31:01,117 --> 00:31:04,020

640
00:31:01,117 --> 00:31:04,020

641
00:31:01,117 --> 00:31:04,020

00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:07,991

I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT I'M ALIVE

659
00:31:46,896 --> 00:31:52,135
THANK YOU, SPIRITS

00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:39,331
DONALD TRUMP SAID THE RESULTS
OF THE 2020 ELECTION SHOULD BE
OVERTURNED 

821
00:42:39,331 --> 00:42:41,657
AND CALLED FOR THE
TERMINATION OF THE CONSTITUTION.

822
00:42:41,657 --> 00:42:46,878
TRUMP PLANS TO TERMINATE THE
CONSTITUTION BY ASKING HERSCHEL
WALKER TO DRIVE IT TO THE
CLINIC

823
00:42:51,407 --> 00:42:56,593
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU GUYS SAW
TODAY, MOROCCO BEAT PORTUGAL
IN QUATERFINAL

824
00:42:56,593 --> 00:43:01,685
IT'S THE BEST WORLD CUP 

825
00:43:01,685 --> 00:43:05,072
SINCE THE AFRICANS WHO BUILT THE STADIUMS.

826
00:43:07,827 --> 00:43:10,582
I DIDN'T DO IT

827
00:43:13,029 --> 00:43:15,722
PORTUGAL'S HEAD COACH DECIDED

828
00:43:15,722 --> 00:43:19,183
NOT TO START SOCCER LEGEND

829
00:43:19,183 --> 00:43:24,679
EVEN MORE INSULTING, AT HALF
TIME, HE TRIED TO TRADE RENALDO
FOR BRITTNEY GRINER.

830
00:43:26,389 --> 00:43:31,951
BUT THE BIGGEST UPSET WAS THAT
FAVORITE BRAZIL WAS ELIMINATED,

831
00:43:31,951 --> 00:43:35,529
EXCEPT FOR A TINY STRIP DOWN THE MIDDLE

832
00:43:40,420 --> 00:43:45,207
NIKE HAS OFFICIALLY CUT TIES
WITH BROOKLYN NETS STAR KYRIE IRVING

833
00:43:45,207 --> 00:43:47,368

ANTI-SEMITISM SCANDAL.

834
00:43:47,368 --> 00:43:52,027
HE SAID HE'S SO DEPRESSED, HE
MIGHT JUMP OFF THE EDGE OF THE
WORLD.

835
00:43:54,888 --> 00:43:59,809
TODAY WAS THE SANTA CON BAR
CRAWL IN NEW YORK CITY

THE ANNUAL REMINDER THAT WHILE
SANTA MAY EXIST, 

837
00:44:04,021 --> 00:44:06,050
GOD DOESN'T.

838
00:44:07,058 --> 00:44:10,548
WELL, FOLKS, THE HOLIDAY

MARY ANN LOUISE FISHER.

841
00:44:21,097 --> 00:44:23,438
HELLO, MICHAEL.

842
00:44:24,628 --> 00:44:27,383
WE GOT THREE MINUTES TO DO THIS.

843

I STILL GOT SEVEN STORES TO HIT

844
00:44:29,632 --> 00:44:32,703
- SO YOU HAVE BEEN PRETTY BUSY.

845
00:44:32,703 --> 00:44:36,542
SEE I'M ONE OF 27 CHILDREN, SO I
GOT A LOT OF SHOPPING TO DO.

846
00:44:36,542 --> 00:44:39,668
AND I NEED TO DO IT FAST AND CRAZY.

847
00:44:39,668 --> 00:44:42,136
YOU EVER SEEN THE AISLES AND
CROSS DRESS FOR LESS 

848
00:44:42,136 --> 00:44:45,796
YEAH.
RACK.
MOST OF THE MERCHANDISE IS ON
THE GROUND.

849
00:44:45,796 --> 00:44:48,160
YEAH, THAT'S ME, MICHAEL.

850
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:52,006

EVERY SINGLE ROSS, THAT'S ALL

851
00:44:52,006 --> 00:44:55,406
SO YOU'RE SINGLE HANDEDLY
TRASHING ALL THE ROSSS

852
00:44:55,406 --> 00:44:58,876
YOU EVER TRIPPED OVER A PAIR

853
00:44:58,876 --> 00:45:01,440
STRUCK TO A WINNY THE
POOH TEAPOT?

854
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:03,460
THAT WAS ME, MICHAEL.

855
00:45:03,460 --> 00:45:06,625
- WHY MESS EVERYTHING UP?
- POWER, MICHAEL.

856
00:45:06,625 --> 00:45:09,118
I NEED TO LEAVE MY MARK.

857
00:45:09,118 --> 00:45:12,740
AND SOMETIMES, TO FIND THAT ONE
PERFECT SHIRT, 

858
00:45:12,740 --> 00:45:16,182
YOU HAVE TO
UNFOLD 40 AND DUMP THEM ALL ON
THE FLOOR.

859
00:45:16,182 --> 00:45:19,635
ALL RIGHT
WELL, YOU'RE HERE TO GIVE US
SOME HOLIDAY SHOPPING TIPS.

860
00:45:19,704 --> 00:45:22,186
THAT'S RIGHT.
TIP NUMBER ONE

861
00:45:22,186 --> 00:45:24,288
GET YOU ONE OF THESE

862
00:45:24,288 --> 00:45:28,106
DID YOU KNOW ANYONE CAN BUY A
NECK BRACE

863
00:45:28,106 --> 00:45:29,973
YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE TO GO TO A DOCTOR

864
00:45:29,973 --> 00:45:32,375
THESE THINGS MAKE PEOPLE STAY
OUT OF YOUR WAY.

865
00:45:32,375 --> 00:45:37,484
THEY THINK YOU'RE WOUNDED, BUT
ONLY YOU KNOW, YOUR NECK IS
STRONG AS HELL

866
00:45:37,846 --> 00:45:41,757
NOW, MICHAEL, GUESS HOW MUCH ALL
THESE SANTA PLATES WERE?

867
00:45:41,757 --> 00:45:43,423
- WHAT?
- $3.

868
00:45:43,423 --> 00:45:46,779
GUESS HOW MUCH THIS SHIRT WAS.

869
00:45:46,779 --> 00:45:49,514
- I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE--
- $3.

870
00:45:49,514 --> 00:45:51,432
- YOU WANT TO SEE HOW I GOT IT
- SURE.

871
00:45:51,432 --> 00:45:55,356
SO HOLD THIS, AND PRETEND YOU'RE
A CUSTOMER LOOKING AT IT.

872
00:45:55,356 --> 00:45:57,480
AIN'T THAT A LOVELY BLOUSE.

873
00:45:57,480 --> 00:46:01,418
GIVE ME THAT DAMN SHIRT
THAT WAS IN MY BASKET!

874
00:46:01,418 --> 00:46:05,030
THAT WAS INTENSE.

875
00:46:05,030 --> 00:46:08,756
I SEE HOW THAT WORKS FOR YOU
BUT DO YOU HAVE ANY OTHER TIPS

876
00:46:08,756 --> 00:46:12,156
TIP NUMBER TWO, IF YOUR BLOOD
ISSUING GAR DROPS, 

877
00:46:12,156 --> 00:46:14,936
J.C. PENNY
GOT NUGGETS.

878
00:46:14,936 --> 00:46:16,966
WHAT?

879
00:46:16,966 --> 00:46:21,219
J.C. PENNY GOT CHICKEN
NUGGETS.

880
00:46:21,219 --> 00:46:25,487
ALL YOU GOT TO DO IS GET
YOURSELF STUCK TOEN THAT
ESCALATOR, MAKE A FUSS, 

881
00:46:25,487 --> 00:46:28,874
AND THE
MANAGER WILL FIND YOU SOME
NUGGETS, OKAY?

882
00:46:28,874 --> 00:46:32,868
- ARE YOU ALL RIGHT
- NO, MICHAEL
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU TALKING
ABOUT?

883
00:46:32,868 --> 00:46:35,145
I KNOW TOO MUCH.
I'VE SEEN TOO MUCH

884
00:46:35,145 --> 00:46:52,402
IT'S A WAR ZONE OUT THERE, AND I

885
00:46:45,061 --> 00:46:52,402
JUST GOT DONE DOING THREE TOURS

886
00:46:45,061 --> 00:46:52,402
IN NORDSTROM IRAQ.

887
00:46:52,402 --> 00:46:56,373
IT'S JUST A DEPARTMENT STORE.

888
00:46:52,402 --> 00:46:56,373
IT'S NOT THAT SERIOUS.

889
00:46:52,402 --> 00:46:56,373
YOU HAVE NO IDEA.

890
00:46:56,373 --> 00:47:01,077
I'M THE ONE OUT HERE ON THESE

891
00:46:56,373 --> 00:47:01,077
FRONT LINES.

892
00:46:56,373 --> 00:47:01,077
NOW, MY THIRD AND FINAL TIP--

893
00:47:01,077 --> 00:47:06,149
AND I SHOULDN'T HAVE TO SAY

894
00:47:01,077 --> 00:47:06,149
THIS, BUT IF YOU CAN, BE BLACK

895
00:47:01,077 --> 00:47:06,149
BECAUSE IF YOU'RE WHITE ACTING

896
00:47:06,149 --> 00:47:10,587
LIKE THIS, SOMEONE WILL TAKE A

897
00:47:06,149 --> 00:47:10,587
VIDEO, AND YOU WILL LOSE YOUR JOB.

898
00:47:10,587 --> 00:47:16,192
OKAY

899
00:47:10,587 --> 00:47:16,192
YOU SEE, MICHAEL, THERE'S NO

900
00:47:10,587 --> 00:47:16,192
SUCH THING AS A BLACK KAREN.

901
00:47:16,192 --> 00:47:20,463
I COULD SLAP THE HELL OUT OF YOU

902
00:47:16,192 --> 00:47:20,463
RIGHT NOW, AND NOBODY WOULD SAY

903
00:47:16,192 --> 00:47:20,463
A WORD

904
00:47:20,463 --> 00:47:25,035
MY JOB IS SAFE.

905
00:47:20,463 --> 00:47:25,035
WHAT DO YOU EVEN DO FOR WORK?

906
00:47:20,463 --> 00:47:25,035
I SUE THE CITY.

907
00:47:25,035 --> 00:47:31,041
THE CITY HAS A LOT OF MONEY AND

908
00:47:25,035 --> 00:47:31,041
A BUNCH OF UNEVEN SIDEWALKS, BABY

909
00:47:31,041 --> 00:47:33,443
OKAY

910
00:47:31,041 --> 00:47:33,443
MARY ANN LOUISE FISHER, EVERYBODY.

911
00:47:33,443 --> 00:47:36,780
I GOT YOU SOM

912
00:47:33,443 --> 00:47:36,780
IT'S IN HERE SOMEWHERE.

913
00:47:33,443 --> 00:47:36,780
I'M GOOD.

914
00:47:36,780 --> 00:47:37,847
IT'S IN HERE SOMEWHERE.

915
00:47:36,780 --> 00:47:37,847
I'M GOOD.

916
00:47:36,780 --> 00:47:37,847
IT'S OKAY.

917
00:47:43,853 --> 00:47:51,695
FLIGHT TO NEWARK AFTER SHE

918
00:47:43,853 --> 00:47:51,695
ACCUSED A FAMILY OF SMUGGLING

919
00:47:43,853 --> 00:47:51,695
COCAINE THEN ASSAULTED MULTIPLE

920
00:47:51,695 --> 00:47:56,866
OFFICERS BY BITING THEM AND

921
00:47:51,695 --> 00:47:56,866
KICKING THEM IN THE GROIN.

922
00:47:51,695 --> 00:47:56,866
SHE'S BEEN SENTENCED TO LIFE IN

923
00:47:56,866 --> 00:48:07,911
THE NEW JERSEY HALL OF FAME.

924
00:47:56,866 --> 00:48:07,911
A NEW ALBUM FROM R. KELLY WAS

925
00:47:56,866 --> 00:48:07,911
REMOVED FROM A STREAMING ALBUM

926
00:48:07,911 --> 00:48:14,084
MINUTES AFTER IT WAS UPLOADED.

927
00:48:07,911 --> 00:48:14,084
IT WAS NOT EASY TO REMOVE HIS

928
00:48:07,911 --> 00:48:14,084
STREAMS, SAID THE MAID WHO

929
00:48:14,084 --> 00:48:19,789
CLEANED HIS HOUSE.

930
00:48:14,084 --> 00:48:19,789
ON CHRISTMAS.

931
00:48:14,084 --> 00:48:19,789
THE LOS ANGELES ZOO ANNOUNCED

932
00:48:19,789 --> 00:48:30,033
THAT EVYLYN HAS BEEN EUTHANIZED,

933
00:48:19,789 --> 00:48:30,033
NOT BECAUSE SHE'S SICK BUT

934
00:48:19,789 --> 00:48:30,033
BECAUSE IT'S LA AND SHE'S IN HER

935
00:48:30,033 --> 00:48:32,635
40s.

936
00:48:30,033 --> 00:48:32,635
DAMN

937
00:48:30,033 --> 00:48:32,635
THIS WILL GET YOU BACK

938
00:48:32,635 --> 00:48:39,476
A WOMAN IN TEXAS ALLEGEDLY

939
00:48:32,635 --> 00:48:39,476
DUMPED THREE BUCKETS OF HUMAN

940
00:48:32,635 --> 00:48:39,476
WASTE IN FRONT OF A POLICE

941
00:48:39,476 --> 00:48:48,551
DEPARTMENT AND DROVE AWAY.

942
00:48:39,476 --> 00:48:48,551
IT'S A RARE CASE OF E RADIC

943
00:48:39,476 --> 00:48:48,551
BEHAVIOR FROM A LADY WHO POOPS

944
00:48:48,551 --> 00:48:55,058
IN A BUCKET.

945
00:48:48,551 --> 00:48:55,058
AS DIS-TURK AS THIS STORY IS,

946
00:48:48,551 --> 00:48:55,058
IT'S NOT AS DISTURBING AS

947
00:48:55,058 --> 00:49:00,597
IMAGINING THE WOMAN'S DRIVE TO

948
00:48:55,058 --> 00:49:00,597
THE POLICE STATION WITH FULL

949
00:48:55,058 --> 00:49:00,597

STARBUCKS BATHROOM

00:49:54,317 --> 00:49:59,122
SO SORT OF LIKE ROLE PLAYING?

971
00:49:54,317 --> 00:49:59,122
YEAH, BUT WITH CELEBRITIES.

972

HI, EVERYONE

1146
00:56:52,402 --> 00:56:55,071
I'M JADA.

1147
00:56:55,071 --> 00:57:01,845
OH, NO, NO.

1148
00:56:55,071 --> 00:57:01,845
AND I WENT ON A DATE WITH

1149
00:56:55,071 --> 00:57:01,845
MINKY CARMICHAEL.

1150
00:57:01,845 --> 00:57:08,418
CAN WE CUT HER MIC?

1151
00:57:01,845 --> 00:57:08,418
AND I HAVE TO SAY, HE HAS H

1152
00:57:01,845 --> 00:57:08,418
THE WORST PENIS I'VE EVER SEEN

1153
00:57:08,418 --> 00:57:16,292
I'M NOT TRYING TO BE MEAN, BUT

1154
00:57:08,418 --> 00:57:16,292
IT LOOKED LIKE AN ESPRESSO CUP.

1155
00:57:08,418 --> 00:57:16,292
THAT'S NOT 100% TRUE.

1156
00:57:16,292 --> 00:57:22,198
ANYONE ELSE HAVE A QUESTION?

1157
00:57:16,292 --> 00:57:22,198
YEAH, I HAVE A QUESTION

1158
00:57:16,292 --> 00:57:22,198
WHAT WAS SO HORRIBLE ABOUT HIS

1159
00:57:22,198 --> 00:57:25,301
THING?

1160
00:57:22,198 --> 00:57:25,301
THE LENGTH WAS OKAY

1161
00:57:22,198 --> 00:57:25,301
FELT LIKE THERE WAS NOTHING

1162
00:57:25,301 --> 00:57:29,105
INSIDE.

1163
00:57:25,301 --> 00:57:29,105
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT?

1164
00:57:25,301 --> 00:57:29,105

1165
00:57:29,105 --> 00:57:35,078
ASKED ME, DO YOU WANT ME TO

1166
00:57:29,105 --> 00:57:35,078
CLOSE IT.

1167
00:57:29,105 --> 00:57:35,078
HOLD UP

1168
00:57:35,078 --> 00:57:39,215
WHAT WAS THERE TO CLOSE?

1169
00:57:35,078 --> 00:57:39,215
I DON'T KNOW.

1170
00:57:35,078 --> 00:57:39,215

1171

1172

MINKY, SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE

1173
00:57:39,215 --> 00:57:47,123
PACKING THE WORM FROM DOOM.

1174
