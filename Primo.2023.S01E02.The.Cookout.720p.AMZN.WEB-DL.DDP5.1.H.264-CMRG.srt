1
00:00:01,210 --> 00:00:03,921
{\an8}Okay, bozos. Listen up.

2
00:00:04,505 --> 00:00:05,798
It's that time of year.

3
00:00:05,881 --> 00:00:09,885
The Gonzales Family Neighborhood Barbecue.

4
00:00:09,969 --> 00:00:12,430
- Awoo!
-  Awoo!

5
00:00:12,513 --> 00:00:13,931
That's enough.

6
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:16,976
Mondo, Ryan, you're on fireworks,
as usual.

7
00:00:17,059 --> 00:00:18,686
Don't know how you can top last year.

8
00:00:18,769 --> 00:00:21,439
It'll come to me. I am but a vessel.

9
00:00:21,522 --> 00:00:23,941
The Aztec god of fire, Xiuhtecuhtli,
speaks through me.

10
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:27,445
Plus, I have a cool app.
We can do 3D renderings of the explosions.

11
00:00:27,528 --> 00:00:29,780
The merging of the ancient
with the modern.

12
00:00:29,864 --> 00:00:31,615
This is how civilization progresses.

13
00:00:31,699 --> 00:00:34,326
Just like when Santana played
with the Matchbox 20 guy.

14
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:36,287
Rollie. Beer duty.

15
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:37,913
Got it. Can't wait.

16
00:00:37,997 --> 00:00:40,124
Beer duty means
you get beer for other people,

17
00:00:40,207 --> 00:00:41,709
not just you drink a lot of beer.

18
00:00:41,792 --> 00:00:43,878
- What?
-  I got the playlist.

19
00:00:43,961 --> 00:00:46,589
Jay's Rump-shaker Backyard Bangerz
was a big hit last year.

20
00:00:46,672 --> 00:00:49,008
Just a reminder,
Denise and the girls will be here.

21
00:00:49,091 --> 00:00:51,177
All the songs will be Kidz Bop versions.

22
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:52,762
I've got another job for you.

23
00:00:52,845 --> 00:00:55,222
The giant hole in the deck
that's big enough

24
00:00:55,306 --> 00:00:57,808
for a person to fall through, fix it.

25
00:00:57,892 --> 00:00:59,643
Why is that our job?

26
00:00:59,727 --> 00:01:03,689
Hey, if I wanted to,
I could punch a hole in this deck.

27
00:01:03,773 --> 00:01:05,232
No chance.

28
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:12,531
Oh, yeah. Right. We'll fix it.

29
00:01:13,115 --> 00:01:17,161
Rafa, you have two jobs.
Be my perfect little angel,

30
00:01:17,244 --> 00:01:20,706
and also rat on your uncles
whenever they do something extra stupid.

31
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:22,166
Done and done.

32
00:01:22,249 --> 00:01:24,502
What about me?

33
00:01:24,585 --> 00:01:25,753
You're head of security.

34
00:01:25,836 --> 00:01:28,047
I'm always head of security.
No one takes me seriously

35
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:29,799
because you never let me bring
my crossbow.

36
00:01:29,882 --> 00:01:31,592
This year, I'm bringing my crossbow.

37
00:01:31,675 --> 00:01:33,594
- No, you're not.
- Fine. Then I'm at least eye gouging.

38
00:01:33,677 --> 00:01:35,471
- No eye gouges.
- Oh, but it's fine for you to do it

39
00:01:35,554 --> 00:01:36,889
at Walmart on Black Friday?

40
00:01:36,972 --> 00:01:38,849
TVs were $60, Mike!

41
00:01:47,942 --> 00:01:50,069
Hey, Rafa. What time should
we be there Monday?

42
00:01:50,152 --> 00:01:52,071
Labor Day at the Gonzales House
starts around 2:00

43
00:01:52,154 --> 00:01:54,698
and ends whenever any of the uncles
get into a fistfight.

44
00:01:54,782 --> 00:01:57,368
So, I'd get there by 2:30.

45
00:01:57,451 --> 00:01:58,452
Sweet.

46
00:01:58,536 --> 00:01:59,995
I moved from Dallas when I was eight

47
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:02,331
and I think that was the last time
I had good Mexican food.

48
00:02:02,414 --> 00:02:05,960
The past few years have just been
German sausage and European fish stew.

49
00:02:06,043 --> 00:02:07,461
They didn't even have Taco Bell?

50
00:02:07,545 --> 00:02:09,129
Oh, I love Taco Bell, dawg.

51
00:02:09,213 --> 00:02:10,714
If I ever get the courage to smoke weed,

52
00:02:10,798 --> 00:02:13,551
I'm gonna get super high
and eat so much Taco Bell.

53
00:02:13,634 --> 00:02:15,761
Actually, it's usually
just a straight barbecue

54
00:02:15,845 --> 00:02:18,472
but I could ask my mom
to make some Mexican stuff.

55
00:02:18,556 --> 00:02:20,182
She is an awesome cook.

56
00:02:20,266 --> 00:02:21,851
Nice. All right. I'll see you all Monday?

57
00:02:24,854 --> 00:02:26,772
Hey. You guys gotta help me out,
all right?

58
00:02:26,856 --> 00:02:28,607
You know how insane the barbecue gets.

59
00:02:28,691 --> 00:02:31,277
I need you to shield Mya
and her family from the worst of it.

60
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,570
Yeah, yeah. We got you.

61
00:02:32,653 --> 00:02:35,781
Oh, remember a few years ago?
The lighter fluid fight?

62
00:02:35,865 --> 00:02:38,367
Was that the same year that
Mike did the nunchuck demonstration

63
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:40,202
then choked out that old man
and woman?

64
00:02:40,286 --> 00:02:41,412
No, no. It was the year that

65
00:02:41,495 --> 00:02:44,123
Jay barbecued Ryan's favorite briefcase
and then fed it to him.

66
00:02:44,206 --> 00:02:47,084
Yeah, this is what I mean
when I say the worst of it.

67
00:02:48,836 --> 00:02:52,047
Blue comets, green chrysanthemums,
red and gold crossettes.

68
00:02:52,131 --> 00:02:55,718
This will be the story our ancestors
have passed down since time immemorial.

69
00:02:55,801 --> 00:03:00,472
An erotic tale of courage,
perseverance, and human frailty.

70
00:03:02,308 --> 00:03:03,559
Told through explosives.

71
00:03:03,642 --> 00:03:05,895
Got it. Now, when you say erotic,

72
00:03:05,978 --> 00:03:08,063
what fireworks would you say
are the horniest?

73
00:03:08,147 --> 00:03:10,608
Roman candles, bottle rockets,
Whistling Petes?

74
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:13,986
- Snakes.
- Of course.

75
00:03:14,069 --> 00:03:15,696
Planning out this year's fireworks?

76
00:03:15,779 --> 00:03:17,615
- Can I help?
- No.

77
00:03:17,698 --> 00:03:18,699
You're not ready.

78
00:03:18,782 --> 00:03:21,160
You said that last year
and the year before that.

79
00:03:21,243 --> 00:03:23,245
How long are you gonna make me wait?
I'm 16.

80
00:03:23,329 --> 00:03:26,916
That is way too young.
No, this is grown man stuff.

81
00:03:26,999 --> 00:03:29,585
Call me when you file your taxes.

82
00:03:29,668 --> 00:03:32,129
Wait, do you do your taxes?
Because literally call me.

83
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:33,839
I can help you for a reasonable fee.

84
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:38,677
I know who you are. I don't need this.

85
00:03:40,596 --> 00:03:44,558
Hamburgers, hotdogs,
ribs, chips, plates, beer.

86
00:03:44,642 --> 00:03:45,809
Anything else?

87
00:03:45,893 --> 00:03:47,519
Well, Mya and her family are coming

88
00:03:47,603 --> 00:03:49,313
and they haven't had
good Mexican food in years

89
00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:51,273
because her dad was stationed overseas.

90
00:03:51,357 --> 00:03:54,276
So, I was wondering
if maybe you could cook something?

91
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,153
I think that's a great idea.

92
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:57,696
Uh, Mexican food?

93
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:58,906
Wait, hold on.

94
00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:02,034
We should just stick to the regular
barbecue plan. It's tradition.

95
00:04:02,117 --> 00:04:06,038
Or we could eat nothing.
Fasting is a very spiritual experience.

96
00:04:06,121 --> 00:04:08,290
You guys can cook
all your regular barbecue stuff.

97
00:04:08,374 --> 00:04:11,794
I will handle the extras.
Tacos, tortas, my famous tamales.

98
00:04:11,877 --> 00:04:13,379
And Rafa, you can help me.

99
00:04:13,462 --> 00:04:16,507
You're actually older than I was when
I taught myself how to cook Mexican food.

100
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:19,093
All right. I'm gonna go to the store
to get everything we need.

101
00:04:19,176 --> 00:04:21,303
I'm so excited.

102
00:04:21,387 --> 00:04:23,055
Exciting.

103
00:04:26,642 --> 00:04:28,894
- What the hell, Primo?
- What'd I do?

104
00:04:28,978 --> 00:04:31,689
Men, we have to tell him.

105
00:04:31,772 --> 00:04:33,399
Are you sure?

106
00:04:33,482 --> 00:04:35,317
It's time.

107
00:04:40,155 --> 00:04:44,868
Your mother is not who you think she is.
She can't cook Mexican food.

108
00:04:44,952 --> 00:04:47,204
What are you talking about?
Her Mexican food is amazing.

109
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:50,624
No. Our Mexican food is amazing.

110
00:04:50,708 --> 00:04:52,960
When your mother was 12 years old,

111
00:04:53,043 --> 00:04:56,714
our mom, your grandma,
got hooked on penny slots.

112
00:04:56,797 --> 00:04:58,966
She would disappear for days at a time.

113
00:04:59,049 --> 00:05:00,801
And Drea took care of us.

114
00:05:00,884 --> 00:05:02,553
More food's ready, guys.

115
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:05,514
I didn't have a lot to work with
but I hope it's okay.

116
00:05:09,601 --> 00:05:14,064
She was so proud of feeding us
that we couldn't bear to break her heart.

117
00:05:14,148 --> 00:05:19,278
From that moment on, we made a pact
to never tell her the truth.

118
00:05:19,361 --> 00:05:20,738
There's more where that came from.

119
00:05:23,782 --> 00:05:25,659
None of this stuff is the right color.

120
00:05:25,743 --> 00:05:27,369
Just shut up and eat it.

121
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:30,247
And eat it, he did.

122
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:31,957
We all did.

123
00:05:32,041 --> 00:05:33,250
It wasn't her fault.

124
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,669
She never had the right ingredients,
so she improvised.

125
00:05:35,753 --> 00:05:37,755
We were so good at lying,
she came to believe

126
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:39,757
her way of doing it was somehow better.

127
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:43,135
All these years, she thought
she reinvented Mexican cuisine.

128
00:05:43,218 --> 00:05:46,847
But really,
she was giving us free colonics.

129
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:48,265
You guys are messing with me.

130
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:50,726
- How bad could it be?
-  How bad could it be?

131
00:05:50,809 --> 00:05:52,978
Have you seen the movie  San Andreas?

132
00:05:53,062 --> 00:05:55,606
It's like that.
But the earthquake is in your butt.

133
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:58,358
Whenever she cooks Mexican food,

134
00:05:58,442 --> 00:06:00,569
we sneak around her back
and fix everything.

135
00:06:00,652 --> 00:06:03,781
This is a rite of passage
for every Gonzales man, Primo.

136
00:06:03,864 --> 00:06:08,118
Lying to your mother
to protect her heart and our guts.

137
00:06:08,202 --> 00:06:09,620
- No. No way.
-  Uh-hmm.

138
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:10,704
Leave me out of this.

139
00:06:10,788 --> 00:06:12,081
You're already in, Primo.

140
00:06:12,164 --> 00:06:14,708
So, you either help us
or you eat your mom's food

141
00:06:14,792 --> 00:06:18,420
and waste away like a conquistador
getting Montezuma's revenge.

142
00:06:19,213 --> 00:06:22,132
Have you seen  The Exorcist?
It's like that.

143
00:06:22,216 --> 00:06:23,717
But the devil is in your butt.

144
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:27,471
Primo, if we don't stop your mom
from cooking,

145
00:06:27,554 --> 00:06:31,225
the entire San Antonio
Metro Sewer System is doomed.

146
00:06:31,308 --> 00:06:33,894
Have you seen the first 10 minutes
of  Saving Private Ryan?

147
00:06:33,977 --> 00:06:37,022
It's like that. But your butt.

148
00:06:37,106 --> 00:06:38,232
-  That's it.
-  That's it, right?

149
00:06:38,315 --> 00:06:39,525
I got it, right? That's pretty good.

150
00:06:39,608 --> 00:06:40,943
- It's actually like that, yes.
- Yeah.

151
00:06:45,614 --> 00:06:46,698
Hey, Frankie.

152
00:06:46,782 --> 00:06:48,492
El Maestro.

153
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:49,660
Good to see you.

154
00:06:49,743 --> 00:06:51,078
I didn't know
what you wanted this year,

155
00:06:51,161 --> 00:06:53,705
so I, uh, I ordered some rare items.

156
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:57,251
Sloppy Migraines, Liquid Pain,

157
00:06:57,334 --> 00:06:59,670
Astronaut Assault, Exploding Babies.

158
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:00,754
Excuse me.

159
00:07:00,838 --> 00:07:04,216
Uh, you don't tell Michael Jordan
which shots to take, okay?

160
00:07:04,299 --> 00:07:08,470
You don't tell Mozart
which trumpet to play or whatever.

161
00:07:08,554 --> 00:07:09,930
I don't know a lot about Mozart

162
00:07:10,013 --> 00:07:12,432
but I do know a lot about my brother
and his genius.

163
00:07:12,516 --> 00:07:15,644
Forgive Ryan.
He's very protective of my vision.

164
00:07:15,727 --> 00:07:17,229
Show Frankie what we need.

165
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:22,151
Oh, my God. It's, it's beautiful.

166
00:07:23,235 --> 00:07:25,362
I'll have all this to you within the hour.

167
00:07:28,991 --> 00:07:30,200
Do we trust him?

168
00:07:30,284 --> 00:07:32,828
He'll come through. He always does.

169
00:07:32,911 --> 00:07:35,247
No, I mean, he took my tablet.
Is he gonna bring it back?

170
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:37,541
No. He's a dirtbag.
He's definitely gonna sell it.

171
00:07:37,624 --> 00:07:40,335
Oh. Oh, Frankie. Frankie!

172
00:07:40,419 --> 00:07:43,547
They say the way to a man's heart
is through his stomach.

173
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:44,882
That applies to women, too.

174
00:07:44,965 --> 00:07:47,551
You learn to cook Mexican food like me,
you'll never be single.

175
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:49,261
You've been single my whole life.

176
00:07:49,344 --> 00:07:52,306
By choice. Now focus.

177
00:07:52,389 --> 00:07:56,393
You're about to learn
the secret recipe for quesadillas.

178
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:59,104
First, you take a tortilla, add cheese,

179
00:07:59,188 --> 00:08:02,065
and then my secret ingredients,

180
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:07,070
canned tuna, horseradish, and cinnamon.

181
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,240
I know. It might sound like
a bizarre combo

182
00:08:10,324 --> 00:08:12,075
but you and your uncles love it, right?

183
00:08:13,869 --> 00:08:14,912
Psst. Psst. Psst.

184
00:08:18,624 --> 00:08:22,002
Do not, under any circumstances, let her
put a horseradish in that quesadilla.

185
00:08:22,085 --> 00:08:23,629
Well, how am I supposed to stop her?

186
00:08:23,712 --> 00:08:25,172
Switch it to this.

187
00:08:26,548 --> 00:08:28,717
You want me to switch horseradish
with horseradish?

188
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,552
It's not horseradish.

189
00:08:30,636 --> 00:08:33,305
It's a mixture of cooked onions,
peppers, and spices.

190
00:08:33,388 --> 00:08:36,350
I call it the Trojan Horseradish.

191
00:08:36,433 --> 00:08:38,310
I love that. Great name.

192
00:08:38,393 --> 00:08:39,394
Right?

193
00:08:39,478 --> 00:08:42,439
Because it protects everything
that goes inside, like a condom.

194
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:43,941
Never mind. You're an idiot.

195
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:48,237
Also, swap in this chicken for tuna
and swap out the cinnamon for cayenne.

196
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,613
Go. Hurry, hurry.

197
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:51,198
Okay.

198
00:08:53,367 --> 00:08:57,454
I know. It looks like a lot of lard,
but believe me, we are gonna need it all.

199
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:04,336
Hey, hey, hey. Watch yourself, Eva.

200
00:09:04,419 --> 00:09:06,338
Oh, not even a thank you?

201
00:09:06,421 --> 00:09:08,173
See, this is why I need my crossbow.

202
00:09:08,257 --> 00:09:09,299
To use on the kids?

203
00:09:09,383 --> 00:09:10,634
Hey, you guys made it.

204
00:09:10,717 --> 00:09:12,386
Great.

205
00:09:12,469 --> 00:09:14,930
There's no crossbow. So glad you came.

206
00:09:15,013 --> 00:09:17,766
Yes, we did. And this is my mom, Jackie.

207
00:09:17,849 --> 00:09:19,059
Great to meet you, Jackie.

208
00:09:19,142 --> 00:09:20,269
Oh.

209
00:09:21,353 --> 00:09:23,188
I'm sorry. I thought we just met

210
00:09:23,272 --> 00:09:25,607
but apparently you and I
have been friends for decades

211
00:09:25,691 --> 00:09:28,819
and therefore, you feel it's appropriate
to address me by my first name.

212
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:30,946
Oh, no, no, no.

213
00:09:31,029 --> 00:09:34,324
I, I'm so sorry, Mrs. Perkins.
I really wasn't trying to...

214
00:09:34,408 --> 00:09:36,827
- Can I talk to you?
- Uh-hmm.

215
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:39,705
I'm sorry. I knew that was gonna happen

216
00:09:39,788 --> 00:09:41,915
and it was gonna freak you out
but I couldn't resist.

217
00:09:48,338 --> 00:09:49,965
These are delicious, Ms. Gonzales.

218
00:09:50,048 --> 00:09:52,009
Thanks, Harris. The secret is cinnamon.

219
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:54,219
Oh, I don't think I even tasted...

220
00:09:54,303 --> 00:09:55,721
It's cinnamon, bro.

221
00:09:56,888 --> 00:09:59,391
You guys never finished
fixing the hole in the deck.

222
00:09:59,474 --> 00:10:01,518
It is a serious safety issue.

223
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:03,687
The food thing has taken up all our time.

224
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:05,772
There is a hole in the deck.

225
00:10:05,856 --> 00:10:07,316
Rollie, go get some cardboard.

226
00:10:09,651 --> 00:10:11,194
What's going on, guys?

227
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:13,613
I just had to stop Uncle Mike
from explaining to Mya's mom

228
00:10:13,697 --> 00:10:15,365
why he wants to shoot kids
with a crossbow.

229
00:10:15,449 --> 00:10:17,701
What do you want from us?
There's too many of them.

230
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:19,745
They're running a five-on-two fast break
against us.

231
00:10:19,828 --> 00:10:21,371
- Oh, no.
-  What?

232
00:10:21,455 --> 00:10:23,665
Mya's brother came. He's the worst.

233
00:10:23,749 --> 00:10:26,460
I heard, at his old school,
he gave a kid a wedgie so bad,

234
00:10:26,543 --> 00:10:28,795
his butt crack grew like
two inches longer.

235
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:30,088
- What?
-  Yeah.

236
00:10:30,172 --> 00:10:31,757
I had no idea people
still did wedgies.

237
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:35,510
That's how much of a dick he is.
He's like a time traveling dick.

238
00:10:35,594 --> 00:10:36,803
Oh.

239
00:10:36,887 --> 00:10:38,430
Uh, yo, what's up, Rock?

240
00:10:38,513 --> 00:10:40,182
It's Rockwell. No small talk.

241
00:10:40,265 --> 00:10:41,808
Does "what's up" count as small talk?

242
00:10:41,892 --> 00:10:44,186
My sister and I have lived
in seven different cities

243
00:10:44,269 --> 00:10:46,646
and there's always some lame ass
trying to get with her.

244
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:50,150
She's too good to settle
for any of you losers.

245
00:10:50,233 --> 00:10:51,401
Uh, but you just met us.

246
00:10:51,485 --> 00:10:54,112
Yeah. And I can already tell
you're losers.

247
00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:57,074
So, which one of you losers is it?

248
00:10:57,949 --> 00:10:59,409
Primo, we need you.

249
00:10:59,493 --> 00:11:01,244
Oh, thank God. Nice meeting you, man.

250
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:04,664
So, you're clearly upset.

251
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:11,129
Eva, come here.
Help out your Uncle Mike.

252
00:11:16,885 --> 00:11:19,679
Still not secure.

253
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,227
Where are we at in the kitchen?

254
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:26,520
The rice is in the rice cooker.

255
00:11:26,603 --> 00:11:29,189
Please tell me she used
the caldo de tomate I left on the counter.

256
00:11:29,272 --> 00:11:30,399
Ketchup.

257
00:11:30,482 --> 00:11:32,609
- Mother ...!
- She did it before I noticed.

258
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:34,152
She also started on some menudo.

259
00:11:34,236 --> 00:11:36,446
Is she crazy? That takes five hours!

260
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:38,198
She called it her seven-minute menudo.

261
00:11:38,281 --> 00:11:39,783
This is worse than I thought.

262
00:11:39,866 --> 00:11:41,952
We need you to get your mom
out of the kitchen for at least 15 minutes

263
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:44,037
while we try to turn
that abomination into food.

264
00:11:44,121 --> 00:11:45,038
How do I do that?

265
00:11:45,122 --> 00:11:46,540
I don't know. You're a teenager.

266
00:11:46,623 --> 00:11:48,583
Complain about something.
Threaten to run away.

267
00:11:48,667 --> 00:11:50,502
Just yell "I'm sick of this"
and start crying.

268
00:11:50,585 --> 00:11:53,088
Do I have to think of everything?
Let's go.

269
00:11:56,299 --> 00:11:58,260
- You ready to make tamales?
- Uh-hmm.

270
00:11:58,343 --> 00:12:02,597
Right. So normally, you would use masa
which is cornmeal

271
00:12:02,681 --> 00:12:04,558
but I like to use matzoh,

272
00:12:04,641 --> 00:12:07,727
which is a traditional Jewish cracker
made with flour and water.

273
00:12:07,811 --> 00:12:08,854
Why?

274
00:12:08,937 --> 00:12:10,397
The first time I made them,
I had to borrow ingredients

275
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,984
from the Jewish family down the street
and your uncles went crazy for it.

276
00:12:14,067 --> 00:12:15,610
You wouldn't think you could just

277
00:12:15,694 --> 00:12:17,487
swap out ingredients
because they sound the same.

278
00:12:17,571 --> 00:12:18,780
But you can.

279
00:12:18,864 --> 00:12:19,865
Wow.

280
00:12:19,948 --> 00:12:23,368
You say tamale, I say TaMazeltov.

281
00:12:24,536 --> 00:12:25,745
That's my little joke.

282
00:12:25,829 --> 00:12:27,914
The Jewish family down the street
went crazy for it.

283
00:12:27,998 --> 00:12:29,082
Hey, ma.

284
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:31,585
Can I talk to you about something
in the family room

285
00:12:31,668 --> 00:12:34,379
for like at least 15 minutes?

286
00:12:34,463 --> 00:12:37,632
Perfect. Tamales will be nice
and soaked through by then.

287
00:12:42,888 --> 00:12:44,473
What's up, baby?

288
00:12:44,556 --> 00:12:48,768
So I was thinking,
this has been such a great barbecue.

289
00:12:48,852 --> 00:12:50,270
So much fun.

290
00:12:50,353 --> 00:12:53,064
Maybe we should just quit
while we're ahead, send everyone home.

291
00:12:53,148 --> 00:12:54,274
What?

292
00:12:54,357 --> 00:12:57,027
Nobody's eaten and
we haven't even done the fireworks yet.

293
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:58,236
What are you...

294
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,197
But there also haven't been
any lighter fluid fights

295
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,364
or regular fights.

296
00:13:01,448 --> 00:13:04,075
It's the Gonzales Family
Neighborhood barbecue, Rafa.

297
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:05,994
Since when are you worried
about how crazy things get?

298
00:13:06,077 --> 00:13:07,787
Ooh, do you remember the time

299
00:13:07,871 --> 00:13:10,874
you and your uncles kept daring me
to shave that weird little dog

300
00:13:10,957 --> 00:13:13,335
and I did it and it turned out
it was a skunk?

301
00:13:13,418 --> 00:13:15,462
- Stinky barbecue.
- Stinky barbecue.

302
00:13:15,545 --> 00:13:17,380
I was so drunk.

303
00:13:17,464 --> 00:13:20,467
But also there's just...

304
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:23,011
you know, there's quite a few people here
that don't really know us.

305
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:26,264
Random example, off the top of my head,

306
00:13:26,348 --> 00:13:30,810
Mya and her mom, and I don't want them
to get to know us.

307
00:13:31,895 --> 00:13:35,106
In my experience,
the people we want in our lives,

308
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:37,734
they're always gonna see
the truth about who we really are.

309
00:13:38,693 --> 00:13:40,362
But, I get it.

310
00:13:40,445 --> 00:13:43,865
The barbecue can get a little dicey.

311
00:13:43,949 --> 00:13:45,033
I tell you what,

312
00:13:45,116 --> 00:13:47,827
I will make sure
that we keep a lid on things.

313
00:13:47,911 --> 00:13:49,412
Deal?

314
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:53,917
- Oh, hold on.
- No, no, no, we have to talk longer.

315
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,795
Hurry up. Drop it.
Come on. Let's go, let's go.

316
00:13:59,965 --> 00:14:01,591
It was Primo's idea.

317
00:14:03,218 --> 00:14:05,637
My best estimate,
all four movements together

318
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:10,350
should last about 26 minutes give or take.
Then, a 45-second epilogue.

319
00:14:10,433 --> 00:14:13,228
Perfect. A symphony and a novel in one.

320
00:14:13,311 --> 00:14:17,566
Lay out the fuses while I pray
for our ancestors to guide my hand.

321
00:14:17,649 --> 00:14:20,151
Miguel, what are you doing
slithering around over here?

322
00:14:20,235 --> 00:14:21,695
Just watching.

323
00:14:21,778 --> 00:14:24,614
- Absolutely no watching. Security!
- Come on.

324
00:14:24,698 --> 00:14:26,408
What seems to be the problem here?

325
00:14:26,491 --> 00:14:27,701
Miguel's watching.

326
00:14:28,952 --> 00:14:32,247
No watching.
That's how you get your eyes gouged, son.

327
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:33,331
Beat it.

328
00:14:34,749 --> 00:14:36,751
- Scoop his eyes out, Mike.
-  Is that what you want?

329
00:14:36,835 --> 00:14:38,211
You want your eyes scooped?

330
00:14:39,838 --> 00:14:42,215
What do you mean
I can't cook Mexican food?

331
00:14:42,299 --> 00:14:44,759
It's not that you can't cook Mexican food.

332
00:14:45,844 --> 00:14:48,597
You did the best that you could
with what you had.

333
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:51,266
But... help me out here.

334
00:14:52,517 --> 00:14:54,769
It's very bad and it hurts when we eat it.

335
00:14:54,853 --> 00:14:58,106
So, every time you've cooked
Mexican food, they've been fixing it.

336
00:14:58,189 --> 00:15:03,028
For the last 25 years.
And just as a reminder, I'm only 16.

337
00:15:03,111 --> 00:15:04,237
No.

338
00:15:05,614 --> 00:15:07,365
I don't buy it.

339
00:15:07,449 --> 00:15:10,368
I'm a great cook.
And we can settle this right now.

340
00:15:10,452 --> 00:15:13,038
Two kinds of tamales.

341
00:15:13,121 --> 00:15:14,664
Yours and mine.

342
00:15:14,748 --> 00:15:16,207
Let's let the people decide.

343
00:15:19,044 --> 00:15:23,673
All we needed was 15 minutes, Primo.
Now, half of us are gonna die.

344
00:15:25,634 --> 00:15:27,385
All right. Listen up, everybody!

345
00:15:27,469 --> 00:15:29,137
It's a tamale taste test.

346
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:31,681
Step right up.

347
00:15:31,765 --> 00:15:33,350
- I'll do it.
-  Perfect.

348
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:34,893
Come on over.

349
00:15:37,979 --> 00:15:39,773
- Try this one first.
- Okay.

350
00:15:43,985 --> 00:15:45,278
Hmm.

351
00:15:45,362 --> 00:15:46,404
Wow, this is delicious.

352
00:15:46,488 --> 00:15:48,156
Oh, is it?

353
00:15:48,239 --> 00:15:51,993
All right. Now, try this one.

354
00:15:54,996 --> 00:15:56,706
Is this supposed to look like that?

355
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:58,708
Just slurp it up, rookie.

356
00:16:00,669 --> 00:16:01,670
No!

357
00:16:03,713 --> 00:16:05,090
Oh, that's disgusting.

358
00:16:06,341 --> 00:16:09,594
I'm so sorry, Ms. Gonzales.
I don't know why I reacted like that.

359
00:16:09,678 --> 00:16:11,388
You've been in Dusseldorf for 10 years.

360
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:13,932
What the hell do you know?
Get out of here.

361
00:16:15,141 --> 00:16:18,186
All right. We need someone who knows
what the hell they're talking about.

362
00:16:18,269 --> 00:16:22,440
Denise! Come on up here.
Move your ass, Denise.

363
00:16:22,524 --> 00:16:26,861
All right.
Here we go. You love my tamales, right?

364
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:33,201
- No!

365
00:16:33,284 --> 00:16:35,078
Where is my crossbow?

366
00:16:35,161 --> 00:16:36,496
Denise?

367
00:16:38,832 --> 00:16:42,711
Could my family all gather
in front of me right now?

368
00:16:54,681 --> 00:16:58,977
I have been cooking this food for you
for decades,

369
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:01,479
pouring my heart into every meal.

370
00:17:01,563 --> 00:17:05,316
And you reward me with lies
and deception?

371
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,944
You are the most despicable,

372
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:12,866
deceitful, sons of bitches
on God's green earth

373
00:17:12,949 --> 00:17:15,952
and I hope that you and every one of you

374
00:17:17,495 --> 00:17:19,205
get hit by a truck

375
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:25,253
filled with 4,000 pounds of shit

376
00:17:25,336 --> 00:17:27,046
because that's what you are.

377
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:30,884
Trucks filled with

378
00:17:30,967 --> 00:17:36,222
and you can burn
in the deepest depths of hell!

379
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:41,686
Dammit! Why didn't you fix this?

380
00:17:51,696 --> 00:17:53,072
Hey.

381
00:17:56,284 --> 00:18:00,705
I know it's not how you imagined,
but it was still beautiful.

382
00:18:00,789 --> 00:18:03,958
Those fireworks exploding behind
Drea's angry head,

383
00:18:04,042 --> 00:18:05,376
it was visual poetry.

384
00:18:06,753 --> 00:18:08,963
I mean, the Face Melters
went off at the exact moment

385
00:18:09,047 --> 00:18:10,757
it looked like Drea's face was melting.

386
00:18:13,885 --> 00:18:14,886
Maybe you're right.

387
00:18:16,221 --> 00:18:20,683
Sometimes I get too close to it.
I want it to be perfect.

388
00:18:20,767 --> 00:18:22,977
But the beauty of fireworks
is their ephemerality.

389
00:18:23,061 --> 00:18:24,521
Exactly.

390
00:18:26,147 --> 00:18:29,317
I don't know what that word means
but yes, that's right.

391
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,986
Guys, I found out who did it.

392
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:33,696
It was Miguel.

393
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:35,031
Great job, dud.

394
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:37,325
This concludes my investigation.

395
00:18:43,373 --> 00:18:45,625
What you did was unforgivable.

396
00:18:47,168 --> 00:18:49,838
But it was also bold and daring.

397
00:18:49,921 --> 00:18:52,173
- You're ready.
- I am?

398
00:18:52,257 --> 00:18:54,717
You remind me of me when I was your age.

399
00:18:54,801 --> 00:18:58,388
And someday,
you'll be exactly like I am now.

400
00:18:59,305 --> 00:19:02,475
Oh. I definitely don't want that.

401
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:03,852
All right. Never mind.

402
00:19:05,395 --> 00:19:06,896
Good luck.

403
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:08,147
That kid sucks.

404
00:19:08,231 --> 00:19:09,649
Right?

405
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:12,735
So, how's your mom?

406
00:19:12,819 --> 00:19:14,529
Well, once at one of the barbecues,

407
00:19:14,612 --> 00:19:17,699
the uncles managed
to set a library on fire

408
00:19:17,782 --> 00:19:20,201
and she still talked to them afterward.

409
00:19:20,285 --> 00:19:22,036
But she's not talking to any of us now.

410
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:26,124
So, she is pretty mad.

411
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:31,629
Listen, I feel like I need to say
something about what went down.

412
00:19:31,713 --> 00:19:34,465
I know what you're gonna say
and I'm so embarrassed.

413
00:19:34,549 --> 00:19:36,384
Wait, you're embarrassed?

414
00:19:36,467 --> 00:19:39,012
Yeah. My family is ridiculous.

415
00:19:39,095 --> 00:19:41,806
I played that joke on you with my mom
and it freaked you out

416
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:43,141
and that was unfair.

417
00:19:43,224 --> 00:19:45,852
I kind of forgot we still don't
really know each other that well.

418
00:19:45,935 --> 00:19:48,521
And then she made your Uncle Ryan
do all those pushups

419
00:19:48,605 --> 00:19:52,191
and Rockwell told me he tried to
intimidate you guys like he always does.

420
00:19:52,275 --> 00:19:55,486
And I hit Mike with the tamale.
So, I'm sorry.

421
00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:58,907
No. My family is crazy.

422
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:00,408
Your family is great.

423
00:20:00,491 --> 00:20:02,201
Your uncles have spent all these years

424
00:20:02,285 --> 00:20:03,995
trying to keep your mom happy.

425
00:20:04,078 --> 00:20:06,080
I mean, they were lying, but still.

426
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:16,299
What's this?

427
00:20:16,382 --> 00:20:17,592
Breakfast.

428
00:20:17,675 --> 00:20:19,385
Apparently I don't know how to cook.

429
00:20:19,469 --> 00:20:20,803
So, I didn't cook.

430
00:20:22,138 --> 00:20:24,223
To be fair,
nobody criticized your breakfast.

431
00:20:25,308 --> 00:20:27,268
But, we can make breakfast.

432
00:20:28,728 --> 00:20:31,314
And we'll go somewhere safe.

433
00:20:35,485 --> 00:20:36,819
Ma, I know you're mad.

434
00:20:36,903 --> 00:20:38,571
No, I'm not. I'm fine.

435
00:20:38,655 --> 00:20:40,490
You just fed everyone raw bacon.

436
00:20:40,573 --> 00:20:42,784
- Uh-hmm.
- Okay.

437
00:20:42,867 --> 00:20:45,870
Good news. So it turns out that Mya
wasn't freaked out at all.

438
00:20:45,954 --> 00:20:48,289
In fact, she says she thought
that it was sweet that our family

439
00:20:48,373 --> 00:20:52,043
is so close that your brothers would work
this hard to try to protect your feelings.

440
00:20:52,126 --> 00:20:54,003
So...

441
00:20:54,087 --> 00:20:56,589
...I guess she did see us
for who we really are.

442
00:20:58,841 --> 00:21:00,760
- See you after school.
- Uh-hmm.

443
00:21:03,471 --> 00:21:06,599
Everyone, living room, now.

444
00:21:07,558 --> 00:21:09,811
What you all did was deceitful.

445
00:21:09,894 --> 00:21:12,397
I understand why you did it.

446
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:16,442
But if this family is gonna stay together,
we cannot have secrets.

447
00:21:16,526 --> 00:21:19,737
So, if there's anything else
that you've been hiding from me

448
00:21:19,821 --> 00:21:22,573
or lying to me about, tell me now.

449
00:21:22,657 --> 00:21:24,450
I promise I won't get angry.

450
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:31,582
Okay. I guess, I'll go first.

451
00:21:31,666 --> 00:21:35,044
Um, I read your diary when we were kids.

452
00:21:36,129 --> 00:21:37,880
Do you still wanna marry Aladdin?

453
00:21:39,632 --> 00:21:41,259
You don't have to answer.

454
00:21:41,342 --> 00:21:44,220
Um, I was the one
who crashed your car.

455
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:47,348
I know you crashed my car, Rollie,
because I was in it.

456
00:21:47,432 --> 00:21:49,017
Both my arms got broken.

457
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:52,228
No, that was a different time.
Like way before that crash.

458
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:54,897
Remember? I lied and said I got carjacked.

459
00:21:54,981 --> 00:21:57,358
- That was my car.
-  It was?

460
00:21:57,442 --> 00:21:59,360
Well, you're not allowed
to get mad either.

461
00:21:59,444 --> 00:22:00,820
Hey, somebody else go.

462
00:22:01,779 --> 00:22:05,658
I know I often say you're my best friend
but really it's my wife.

463
00:22:05,742 --> 00:22:07,368
That's the way it should be.

464
00:22:07,452 --> 00:22:09,579
Also I found dad. He lives in Florida.

465
00:22:09,662 --> 00:22:10,830
-  What?
-  Whoa.

466
00:22:10,913 --> 00:22:13,207
It's fine. He's a horrible person.

467
00:22:14,792 --> 00:22:17,503
I also read your diary once.

468
00:22:17,587 --> 00:22:20,298
But it was when we were adults.

469
00:22:20,381 --> 00:22:22,884
It was today actually like an hour ago.

470
00:22:22,967 --> 00:22:26,888
I picked it up by accident
then I really got sucked in.

471
00:22:26,971 --> 00:22:28,347
You're an excellent writer.

472
00:22:29,682 --> 00:22:32,185
I stole your Skechers Shape-Ups

473
00:22:32,268 --> 00:22:33,728
because they make me look taller.

474
00:22:33,811 --> 00:22:35,396
You wear the same shoe size as Drea?

475
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:39,150
No, I ball my foot up like a little fist.
That's not the point.

476
00:22:39,233 --> 00:22:41,611
Look, we all came clean.
But what about you?

477
00:22:41,694 --> 00:22:44,572
This goes both ways. Is there
anything that you wanna confess to us?

478
00:22:44,655 --> 00:22:47,408
Anything that you've ever
lied to us about?

479
00:22:49,035 --> 00:22:50,453
You really can't see me?

480
00:22:50,536 --> 00:22:51,954
Who said that?

481
00:22:53,873 --> 00:22:55,958
Drea. I'm right here.

482
00:22:56,042 --> 00:22:57,710
Oh...

483
00:22:57,794 --> 00:22:59,837
Oh my God.
You look exactly like Nick Lachey.

484
00:22:59,921 --> 00:23:01,631
Right?

485
00:23:01,714 --> 00:23:03,257
I didn't do it, Drea.

486
00:23:03,341 --> 00:23:04,842
I believe you.

487
00:23:04,926 --> 00:23:07,345
New mascot for the business.

488
00:23:07,428 --> 00:23:09,806
This is a very good idea.

489
00:23:09,889 --> 00:23:13,476
I call it Saturn's Scrotum.

490
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:15,853
It's stunning.

491
00:23:15,937 --> 00:23:19,607
I have never lied to any of you
and I never will.

492
00:24:52,450 --> 00:24:54,035
Next on  Primo...

493
00:24:54,118 --> 00:24:55,077
Your brother's in trouble.

494
00:24:55,161 --> 00:24:56,621
You're gonna have to be more specific.

495
00:24:56,704 --> 00:25:00,541
Can I borrow your car tomorrow?
Mya asked me for a ride home.

496
00:25:00,625 --> 00:25:01,876
How'd it go? Did the cologne work?

497
00:25:01,959 --> 00:25:03,502
How'd it go? Terrible.

498
00:25:03,586 --> 00:25:04,795
They're in the woods now?

499
00:25:04,879 --> 00:25:05,838
Rollie?

500
00:25:05,922 --> 00:25:07,590
Let me know if you're
looking for extra cash.

501
00:25:07,673 --> 00:25:09,926
I always need bodies.
And grab some garbage bags.

502
00:25:10,009 --> 00:25:12,803
There's a bunch of dead squirrels
we gotta get rid of at the job site.
