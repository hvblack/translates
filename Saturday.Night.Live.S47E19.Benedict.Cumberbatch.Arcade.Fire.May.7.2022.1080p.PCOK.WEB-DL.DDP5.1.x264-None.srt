MISPRISION

MORAL CLARITY
YEARS AGO

9
00:00:28,524 --> 00:00:33,997
LAWS 2022

10
00:00:38,555 --> 00:00:43,332
WHAT IS THE MATTER?

11
00:00:43,332 --> 00:00:44,900
LOOK

12
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:46,247
IT'S NOTHING, BUT

13
00:00:46,247 --> 00:00:51,227
IT'S JUST, WHILST I WAS CLEANING
THE HOLE IN THE SIDE OF THE
CASTLE WHERE WE POOP

14
00:00:51,227 --> 00:00:54,542
AND IT
FALLS INTO A SKY INTO A MOAT
FULL OF HUMAN FECES,

15
00:00:54,542 --> 00:00:57,387
I STARTED
TO THINK ABOUT ABORTION.

16
00:00:57,387 --> 00:00:59,525
OH, REALLY?
WHAT ABOUT IT?

17
00:00:59,612 --> 00:01:02,628
WELL, DO YOU THINK WE OUGHT
TO MAKE A LAW AGAINST IT?

18
00:01:02,628 --> 00:01:06,223
YOU MEAN LIKE THE LAW WE HAVE
AGAINST POINTY SHOES?

19
00:01:06,223 --> 00:01:10,935
OR THE LAW THAT IF YOU HUNT A
DEER IN THE ROYAL FOREST, THEY
CUT OFF YOUR GENITALS?

20
00:01:10,935 --> 00:01:14,655
EXACTLY.
SOMETHING FAIR AND REASONABLE
LIKE THOSE LAWS.

21
00:01:14,655 --> 00:01:17,249
WE SHOULD MAKE A LAW THAT WILL
STAND THE TEST OF TIME

22
00:01:17,249 --> 00:01:20,376
SO THAT
HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF YEARS
FROM NOW THEY'LL LOOK BACK AND SAY,

23
00:01:20,376 --> 00:01:24,540
NO NEED TO UPDATE THIS AT
ALL, THEY NAILED IT BACK IN
1235.

24
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:29,770
I DON'T KNOW, MAYBE WE
SHOULDN'T BAN ABORTION IN ALL OF
ENGLAND.

25
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:32,208
WE COULD DECIDE IT ON AN FEIFDOM
BY FEIFDOM BASIS.

26
00:01:32,266 --> 00:01:35,261
OH, GOOD IDEA.
AND THEN IF YOUR CONCUBINE NEEDS ONE,

27
00:01:35,261 --> 00:01:40,024
YOU CAN SEND HER TO GET IT
IN OLD YORK CITY.

28
00:01:40,024 --> 00:01:43,707
IF WE OUTLAW ABORTION, HOW
WOULD WE PUNISH THE MOTHER?

29
00:01:43,707 --> 00:01:47,020
BECAUSE SHE'LL NEED TO BE PUNISHED.
SHE'LL BE SO HAPPY ABOUT HER
CRIME.

30
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:52,970
WE COULD
PUT HER ON A BOAT AND LET HER
SAIL OFF THE CLIFF AT THE EDGE
OF THE WORLD.

31
00:01:52,970 --> 00:01:57,077
SHE WOULD OF COURSE, TUMBLE DOWN
WHERE THE FOUR TURTLES ARE
HOLDING UP THE EARTH

32
00:01:57,077 --> 00:01:58,960
AND PERHAPS
ONE OF THEM WILL EAT HER.

33
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,463
ALMOST TOO OBVIOUS.

34
00:02:01,464 --> 00:02:06,510
DRUNK

35
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:10,244
SEX

36
00:02:10,244 --> 00:02:13,526
TOWN
BURNED

37
00:02:14,075 --> 00:02:16,083
MAYBE

38
00:02:16,146 --> 00:02:20,726
WHAT IF THE DONKEY GETS HER PREGNANT.
THEN WE'D LEGALLY HAVE TO
PROTECT HER FETUS.

39
00:02:20,803 --> 00:02:24,980
IF THE HALF DONKEY IS A MAN, HE
COULD BECOME A KING.

40
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:27,692
THE PROPHECY!

41
00:02:28,112 --> 00:02:31,886
LET'S BE CAREFUL.
THE WORST THING THAT COULD HAPPEN

42
00:02:31,886 --> 00:02:35,526
IS IF SOMEONE LEAKS THE
CONVERSATION TO THE TOWN CRYER.

43
00:02:35,526 --> 00:02:38,338
KNOCK KNOCK!
JUST KIDDING.
WE DON'T HAVE DOORS.

44
00:02:38,338 --> 00:02:43,630
ANYHOO, I WAS OUTSIDE WATCHING
THE SHERIFF THROW LEFT-HANDED
CHILDREN INTO THE RIVER,

45
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:47,590
AND
OVER HERE YOU'S TALKING ABOUT
THE NEW LAW?

46
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:52,728
OH-OH, WOMAN HEAR IDEAS AND
MAKE ME THINK, WHY I HAVE THOSE?

47
00:02:52,728 --> 00:02:55,353
YEAH, SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

48
00:02:55,353 --> 00:02:57,248
SO I HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS.

49
00:02:57,248 --> 00:03:02,311
CAREFUL, MARGARET, DON'T MAKE
US MAKE ANOTHER HOLE IN YOUR
SKULL SO YOUR BRAIN CAN BREATHE.

50
00:03:02,312 --> 00:03:03,933
RIGHT.

51
00:03:03,933 --> 00:03:08,478
I WAS JUST WONDERING SINCE I'M
ALMOST AT THE CHILDBEARING AGE OF 12,

52
00:03:08,478 --> 00:03:11,413
SHOULD IT BE THE WOMAN'S
DECISION?

53
00:03:11,436 --> 00:03:14,987
SINCE HAVING A BABY OFFERS A 50%
CHANCE OF DYING?

54
00:03:14,987 --> 00:03:17,586
YES, BUT THAT'S WHY WE'RE
ALSO OFFERING MATERNITY LEAVE.

55
00:03:17,586 --> 00:03:21,798
WHEN YOU'RE DONE WITH 20 YEARS
OF CONTINUOUS MATERNITY, YOU CAN
LEAVE.

56
00:03:21,799 --> 00:03:25,528
SHOULDN'T WE MAKE EXCEPTIONS
IN CASE OF RAPE OR INCEST?

57
00:03:25,528 --> 00:03:28,593
BUT THOSE ARE THE ONLY KINDS
OF SEX.

58
00:03:28,593 --> 00:03:34,982
YEAH, I GUESS I JUST DON'T
UNDERSTAND WHY YOU'RE SO
OBSESSED WITH THIS ISSUE.

59
00:03:34,982 --> 00:03:38,261
WHAT ABOUT THE FACT THAT NO ONE
CAN READ AND WRITE?

60
00:03:38,261 --> 00:03:40,172
AND EVERYONE'S DIYING IN A
PLAGUE?

61
00:03:40,172 --> 00:03:44,099
YOU THINK JUST BECAUSE I HAVE
ACTIVE PLAGUE

62
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:46,637
THAT MEANS I NEED
TO WEAR A MASK?

63
00:03:46,637 --> 00:03:49,642
IT'S MY BODY, MY CHOICE.

64
00:03:49,643 --> 00:03:53,462
LIMIT

65
00:03:53,462 --> 00:03:56,023
HAIRCUT

66
00:03:57,123 --> 00:03:59,860
WHEN HAPPY

67
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:05,178
CHURCH
CHILDREN

68
00:04:05,178 --> 00:04:07,890
BIRTH CONTROL

69
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:13,654
CAN'T PREGNANT

70
00:04:13,654 --> 00:04:18,513
THERE'S ALWAYS PLAN B,
LETTING 1,000 BEES STING YOU FOREVER.

71
00:04:18,513 --> 00:04:20,307
ALL

72
00:04:20,307 --> 00:04:24,966
- I THINK WE SHOULD HAVE A
VOTE.
- AYE!

73
00:04:25,057 --> 00:04:27,960
- AND THOSE OPPOSED?
- NAY.

74
00:04:27,961 --> 00:04:33,038
PLAY

75
00:04:34,802 --> 00:04:38,288
YOU EVER GET THE FEELING THIS
IS NOT GOING TO BE YOUR CENTURY?

76
00:04:38,288 --> 00:04:40,710
ENOUGH

77
00:04:44,051 --> 00:04:47,207
MY GOD, AN OGRE.

78
00:04:47,207 --> 00:04:50,446
NO, JUST A WOMAN IN HER 30s.

79
00:04:50,447 --> 00:04:54,482
WEIRD

80
00:04:54,482 --> 00:04:56,234
I CAN SEE THE FUTURE.

81
00:04:56,234 --> 00:05:01,285
AND WHETHER OR NOT, DEAR GIRL,
THESE BARBARIC RULES WILL BE OVERTURNED

82
00:05:01,285 --> 00:05:03,919
BY SOMETHING CALLED PROGRESS.

83
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:07,506
AND THEN ABOUT 50 YEARS AFTER THE PROGRESS,

84
00:05:07,506 --> 00:05:10,465
THEY'LL BE LIKE
HEY, MAYBE WE SHOULD UNDO THE PROGRESS.

85
00:05:10,465 --> 00:05:14,333
I DON'T KNOW WHY MY VISIONS FROM
THAT TIME ARE CONFUSING.

86
00:05:14,333 --> 00:05:18,741
IT SEEMS LIKE ALL OF THEM COME
FROM A HOLE FROM A PLACE CALLED FLORIDA.

87
00:05:18,742 --> 00:05:21,424
WEIRD

88
00:05:21,424 --> 00:05:26,933
AND YOU SHOULD WATCH THE TRIALS
OF JOHNNY DEPP AND AMBER HEARD.

89
00:05:27,004 --> 00:05:29,380
I KNOW IT DOESN'T SOUND GREAT,

90
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:33,997
BUT NO MATTER HOW MANY CHOICES
THEY TAKE AWAY FROM WOMEN,

91
00:05:33,997 --> 00:05:39,022
WE'VE
ALWAYS GOT THE CHOICE TO KEEP
FIGHTIN'!

92
00:05:40,826 --> 00:05:43,900
THAT'S REALLY INSPIRING.

93
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:46,723
AFTER HEARING YOUR PERSPECTIVE,
I'VE SUDDENLY REALIZED,

94
00:05:46,723 --> 00:05:48,944
YOU'RE A
WITCH, AND WE'RE GOING TO SET
YOU ON FIRE.

95
00:05:48,944 --> 00:05:50,898
IT WOULDN'T BE THE FIRST
TIME.

96
00:05:50,898 --> 00:05:55,195
AND LIVE, FROM NEW YORK,
IT'S SATURDAY NIGHT

97
00:08:06,348 --> 00:08:11,484
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN -- BENEDICT
CUMBERBATCH!

98
00:08:29,361 --> 00:08:32,516
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU, THANK YOU SO MUCH.

99
00:08:32,516 --> 00:08:36,083
I REALLY AM THRILLED TO BE BACK
HOSTING "SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE."

100
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:38,697
IT'S BEEN A REALLY FUN, GREAT WEEK.

101
00:08:38,782 --> 00:08:42,289
I HAVE TO BE HONEST, BECAUSE
MOST OF THE SKETCH WRITERS

102
00:08:42,289 --> 00:08:48,129
WERE
PITCHING ME AS DR. STRANGE.

103
00:08:50,813 --> 00:08:55,505
I LIKE THE CHARACTER,

104
00:08:55,505 --> 00:08:59,507
BUT I HAVE BEEN IN OTHER FILMS,

105
00:08:59,507 --> 00:09:02,346
AND ONE SAID TO ME, LIKE WHAT?

106
00:09:02,346 --> 00:09:06,858
AND I SAID, WELL, "THE POWER OF
THE DOG", FOR EXAMPLE.

107
00:09:07,695 --> 00:09:11,356
AND HE SAID, "NOBODY SAW IT."

108
00:09:11,356 --> 00:09:15,497
I SAID COME ON, MAN, I WAS
NOMINATED FOR AN OSCAR FOR THAT.

109
00:09:16,544 --> 00:09:18,677
I MEAN, I DIDN'T WIN.

110
00:09:18,753 --> 00:09:22,711
I WAS BEAT BY WILL SMITH.

111
00:09:23,977 --> 00:09:27,724
NO, NOT PHYSICALLY.
NOT PHYSICALLY.

112
00:09:31,101 --> 00:09:36,966
BUT I'M REALLY HONORED TO BE
HOSTING THE MOTHER'S DAY SNL SHOW.

113
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:42,993
AND OF COURSE I WANT TO WISH A
VERY SPECIAL HAPPY MOTHER'S DAY
TO MY MUM.

114
00:09:42,993 --> 00:09:45,747
SHE'S ACTUALLY ON HOLIDAY IN
GREECE AT THE MOMENT.

115
00:09:45,747 --> 00:09:48,641
AND SNL OFFERED TO FLY HER HERE
FIRST CLASS,

116
00:09:48,641 --> 00:09:53,128
AND SHE SAID NO,
I'M ON A BEACH IN GREECE, ARE
YOU INSANE?

117
00:09:53,128 --> 00:09:55,327
I LOVE YOU, MUM.

118
00:09:55,777 --> 00:10:01,224
WHEN I WAS YOUNGER, WE USED
THESE WEIRD FUNNY NAMES WE USED TO CALL EACH OTHER,

119
00:10:01,224 --> 00:10:03,441
AND I CALLED HER POOKIE,

120
00:10:03,441 --> 00:10:07,122
AND SHE CALLED ME
BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH.

121
00:10:07,544 --> 00:10:10,553
AND THEN I WENT TO A BOARDING
SCHOOL OUTSIDE OF LONDON,

122
00:10:10,553 --> 00:10:13,238
YOU
MAY HAVE HEARD OF IT, CALLED HOGWARTS.

123
00:10:13,239 --> 00:10:17,531
AMAZING

124
00:10:17,531 --> 00:10:20,849
AND THERE ARE BEAUTIFUL,
BEAUTIFUL DRAWING AND ILLUSTRATIONS.

125
00:10:20,849 --> 00:10:24,519
I CAN'T DO THAT FOR HER,
OBVIOUSLY, BUT I THOUGHT I'D USE
A BIT OF THIS MONOLOGUE

126
00:10:24,519 --> 00:10:28,546
TO THANK
HER FOR ALL THAT SHE'S DONE FOR
ME, SO.

127
00:10:30,331 --> 00:10:35,128
HEY, MUM, IT'S ME, YOUR SON,
LITTLE BENEDICT.

128
00:10:35,412 --> 00:10:37,791
THANK YOU FOR ALWAYS BEING THERE
FOR ME.

129
00:10:37,791 --> 00:10:42,332
YOU KNOW, GROWING UP, EVERY
TIMELY A PROBLEM, HUNDRED A SOLUTION.

130
00:10:42,401 --> 00:10:46,714
FOR INSTANCE, WHEN I LOST MY
FRONT TEETH I WAS WORRIED ABOUT BEING TEASED,

131
00:10:46,714 --> 00:10:51,755
YOU SAID IT'S
OKAY.
JUST TRY TO SMILE WITHOUT
OPENING YOUR MOUTH.

132
00:10:51,755 --> 00:10:53,898
GREAT ADVICE,

133
00:10:53,898 --> 00:10:57,537
BUT IT ALSO EXPLAINS TO THIS DAY AND IN
EVERY RED CARPET PHOTOGRAPH

134
00:10:57,537 --> 00:10:59,866
I'M SMILING LIKE THIS.

135
00:11:02,489 --> 00:11:07,264
SERIOUSLY, THOUGH, MUM, YOU'VE
SHOWN ME LOVE EVERY STEP OF THE WAY,

136
00:11:07,268 --> 00:11:09,104
I LOVE YOU, POOKIE.

137
00:11:09,759 --> 00:11:14,921
AND SPEAKING OF MOTHERS, MY WIFE
SOPHIE IS IN THE AUDIENCE TONIGHT,

138
00:11:14,921 --> 00:11:18,763
AND I'D LIKE TO WISH
HER A HAPPY MOTHER'S DAY, TOO.

139
00:11:19,523 --> 00:11:21,851
HI, SOPHIE.

140
00:11:23,921 --> 00:11:27,665
IT'S ME, YOUR HUSBAND.

141
00:11:27,665 --> 00:11:29,948
LITTLE BENEDICT.

142
00:11:31,075 --> 00:11:34,327
I'M CONSTANTLY IN AWE OF YOU.

143
00:11:34,327 --> 00:11:39,721
YOU GAVE BIRTH TO OUR BOYS AND THAT IS A MIRACLE,

144
00:11:39,721 --> 00:11:45,086
AND ACCORDING
TO YOU, I WAS OFF DRESSING UP AS
A WIZARD.

145
00:11:45,087 --> 00:11:47,225
SORCERER

146
00:11:47,225 --> 00:11:50,268
DON'T WORRY

147
00:11:50,268 --> 00:11:54,219
BUT SERIOUSLY, SOPHIE, I HOPE
THAT WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT

148
00:11:54,293 --> 00:11:56,695
YOU
REALIZE THAT IT EVENS OUT.

149
00:11:56,788 --> 00:11:59,880
IF YOU THINK BEING A MUM IS HARD,

150
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:02,204
TRY DOING THIS.

00:12:19,951 --> 00:12:25,532
SEEING ALL YOU'VE DONE FOR
ME AND OUR CHILDREN WARMS MY
HEART AND PUTS A SMILE ON MY FACE,

156
00:12:25,532 --> 00:12:28,270
A SMILE LIKE THIS.

157
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:31,699

ARCADE FIRE IS HERE.

158

00:12:54,863 --> 00:12:57,700
OH, MY GOSH.

163
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:01,770
YOU DID TOO MUCH.

164
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:01,770
WELL, YOU DESERVE IT.

165
00:13:01,770 --> 00:13:13,682
AFTER ALL, YOU'RE OUR MOM. WELL.

166
00:13:01,770 --> 00:13:13,682
I'M -- I'M YOUR WIFE.

167
00:13:13,682 --> 00:13:22,057
THAT'S WHAT I MEANT.

168
00:13:13,682 --> 00:13:22,057
WHO WANTS TO GO FIRST?

169
00:13:13,682 --> 00:13:22,057
I DO, I DO.

170
00:13:22,057 --> 00:13:24,693
OH, OKAY.

171
00:13:22,057 --> 00:13:24,693
OH, YOU KNOW I LOVE THESE LITTLE

172
00:13:22,057 --> 00:13:24,693
WOODEN SIGNS.

173
00:13:24,693 --> 00:13:27,162
LET ME SEE.

174
00:13:24,693 --> 00:13:27,162
OH, "LIFE DOESN'T COME WITH A

175
00:13:24,693 --> 00:13:27,162
MANUAL, IT COMES WITH A MOTHER."

176
00:13:27,162 --> 00:13:31,767
OH, WHERE DID YOU GET THIS?

177
00:13:27,162 --> 00:13:31,767
WE GOT IT AT HOME DEPOT.

178
00:13:27,162 --> 00:13:31,767
THEY SELL ART THERE TOO.

179
00:13:31,767 --> 00:13:35,571
THIS ONE'S FROM ME.

180
00:13:31,767 --> 00:13:35,571
OH, THANK YOU, JOHN. OKAY.

181
00:13:35,571 --> 00:13:39,541
"MOM TURNED UPSIDE DOWN SPELLS

182
00:13:35,571 --> 00:13:39,541
'WOW.'"

183
00:13:35,571 --> 00:13:39,541
TURN IT UPSIDE DOWN, IT

184
00:13:39,541 --> 00:13:45,948
ACTUALLY WORKS.

185
00:13:39,541 --> 00:13:45,948
OH, NOW I SEE, YOU'RE RIGHT.

186
00:13:39,541 --> 00:13:45,948

188
00:13:45,948 --> 00:13:50,719

00:13:45,948 --> 00:13:50,719
OH, OKAY, LET'S SEE HERE.

190
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:56,158
THANK YOU.

191
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:56,158
"DEAR MOM, WE SUCKED YOUR TEATS

192
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:56,158

193
00:13:56,158 --> 00:14:03,265
BATHING SUIT.

194
00:13:56,158 --> 00:14:03,265
HAPPY MOTHER'S DAY."

195
00:13:56,158 --> 00:14:03,265
GOOD ONE.

196
00:14:03,265 --> 00:14:07,202
I GUESS I THOUGHT THAT --

197
00:14:03,265 --> 00:14:07,202
THAT WOULD HAVE A FUN RHYME OR SOMETHING.

198
00:14:07,202 --> 00:14:12,107
BUT THANK YOU.

199
00:14:07,202 --> 00:14:12,107
YOU, KIND OF, LOOK LIKE THE

200
00:14:07,202 --> 00:14:12,107
WOMAN IN THE SIGN.

201
00:14:12,107 --> 00:14:19,481
YEAH, I'M -- I DON'T KNOW.

202
00:14:12,107 --> 00:14:19,481
OH, HONEY, GIVE HER YOURS.

203
00:14:12,107 --> 00:14:19,481
HERE YOU GO, MRS. M.

204
00:14:19,481 --> 00:14:23,285
JUST WANTED TO SAY THANKS FOR

205
00:14:19,481 --> 00:14:23,285
WELCOMING ME TO THE FAMILY.

206
00:14:19,481 --> 00:14:23,285
OH, GOSH.

207
00:14:23,285 --> 00:14:28,724
OF COURSE, DANNY.

208
00:14:23,285 --> 00:14:28,724
HAVING A MOTHER-IN-LAW IS LIKE

209
00:14:23,285 --> 00:14:28,724
HAVING CRABS.

210
00:14:28,724 --> 00:14:33,228
AWW!

211
00:14:28,724 --> 00:14:33,228
WHAT -- IS THERE MORE ON THE

212
00:14:28,724 --> 00:14:33,228
BACK?

213
00:14:33,228 --> 00:14:35,464
I FEEL LIKE THEY DIDN'T FINISH

214
00:14:33,228 --> 00:14:35,464
THE JOKE.

215
00:14:33,228 --> 00:14:35,464
WELL, YOU'RE GOING TO LIKE

216
00:14:35,464 --> 00:14:38,167
THIS ONE. OKAY.

217
00:14:35,464 --> 00:14:38,167
WELL -- OH, I LIKE THE COLOR,

218
00:14:38,167 --> 00:14:43,872
HEY.

219
00:14:38,167 --> 00:14:43,872
"WERE YOUR EARS RINGING?

220
00:14:38,167 --> 00:14:43,872
I WAS IN THERAPY."

221
00:14:43,872 --> 00:14:54,316
WELL, THAT ONE DOESN'T EVEN SAY

222
00:14:43,872 --> 00:14:54,316
"HAPPY MOTHER'S DAY."

223
00:14:43,872 --> 00:14:54,316
I PICKED THIS ONE ALL OUT BY

224
00:14:54,316 --> 00:14:59,455
MYSELF.

225
00:14:54,316 --> 00:14:59,455
IT'S A BIG ONE.

226
00:14:54,316 --> 00:14:59,455
DEAR WIFE, NOW THAT THE KIDS ARE

227
00:14:59,455 --> 00:15:04,960
GROWN, WE DON'T HAVE SEX

228
00:14:59,455 --> 00:15:04,960
ANYMORE, BUT WE DO SOMETIMES,

229
00:14:59,455 --> 00:15:04,960
AND THAT'S FUN.

230
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:07,930
WHAT?

231
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:07,930
THIS ONE ACTUALLY GOES

232
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:07,930
THROUGH IT.

233
00:15:07,930 --> 00:15:12,501
DON'T READ INTO IT AS ME ASKING

234
00:15:07,930 --> 00:15:12,501
FOR MORE SEX.

235
00:15:07,930 --> 00:15:12,501
THE AMOUNT THAT WE ARE DOING IS

236
00:15:12,501 --> 00:15:19,708
GOOD FOR ME, HAPPY MOTHER'S DAY.

237
00:15:12,501 --> 00:15:19,708
OKAY, THESE ARE GETTING

238
00:15:12,501 --> 00:15:19,708
REALLY SPECIFIC AND PERSONAL.

239
00:15:19,708 --> 00:15:30,953
YEAH, THEY'RE GREAT, RIGHT?

240
00:15:19,708 --> 00:15:30,953
I THINK YOU SPENT TOO MUCH.

241
00:15:19,708 --> 00:15:30,953
OH, NO, THEY'RE LIKE $1.99.

242
00:15:30,953 --> 00:15:36,725
OKAY, I WANT TO READ THIS ONE.

243
00:15:30,953 --> 00:15:36,725
DEAR MOM, IF YOU DIED AND MOM

244
00:15:36,725 --> 00:15:42,598
REMARRIED, I'M NOT FINISHED, IT

245
00:15:36,725 --> 00:15:42,598
WOULD BE AN ADJUSTMENT, BUT I

246
00:15:36,725 --> 00:15:42,598
FEEL LIKE WE WOULD GET TO A

247
00:15:42,598 --> 00:15:48,837
PLACE WHERE WE WERE ABLE TO CALL

248
00:15:42,598 --> 00:15:48,837
THE NEW WOMAN "MOM."

249
00:15:42,598 --> 00:15:48,837
HAPPY MOTHER'S DAY.

250
00:15:48,837 --> 00:15:52,474
OKAY.

251
00:15:48,837 --> 00:15:52,474
OKAY.

252
00:15:48,837 --> 00:15:52,474
I DON'T UNDERSTAND, YOU KNOW.

253
00:15:52,474 --> 00:15:58,981
USUALLY THESE SIGNS SAY

254
00:15:52,474 --> 00:15:58,981
SOMETHING LIKE, YOU KNOW,

255
00:15:52,474 --> 00:15:58,981
"CAUTION, MOM NEEDS WINE", OR

256
00:15:58,981 --> 00:16:12,761
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

257
00:15:58,981 --> 00:16:12,761
WE HAVE ONES LIKE THAT HERE.

258
00:15:58,981 --> 00:16:12,761
OKAY, IT SAYS IT'S WINE

259
00:16:12,761 --> 00:16:15,497
O'CLOCK.

260
00:16:12,761 --> 00:16:15,497
I JUST LOVE WATCHING THE SUN RISE.

261
00:16:15,497 --> 00:16:19,935
DOES THAT IMPLY I'M GETTING

262
00:16:15,497 --> 00:16:19,935
DRUNK AT DAWN?

263
00:16:15,497 --> 00:16:19,935
HERE'S A GOOD ONE.

264
00:16:19,935 --> 00:16:26,909
OKAY.

265
00:16:19,935 --> 00:16:26,909
I ONLY DRINK ON DAYS THAT END IN

266
00:16:19,935 --> 00:16:26,909
"Y", AND DURING HOURS THAT HAVE

267
00:16:26,909 --> 00:16:33,849
NUMBERS IN THEM.

268
00:16:26,909 --> 00:16:33,849
HERE'S ANOTHER.

269
00:16:26,909 --> 00:16:33,849
OH, MY.

270
00:16:33,849 --> 00:16:37,653
OKAY.

271
00:16:33,849 --> 00:16:37,653
I'M NOT DRUNK, IT'S JUST THE

272
00:16:33,849 --> 00:16:37,653
WINE TALKING.

273
00:16:37,653 --> 00:16:42,658
OH.

274
00:16:37,653 --> 00:16:42,658

276
00:16:42,658 --> 00:16:49,465

278
00:16:49,465 --> 00:16:58,841

I'M AN EFFING MESS.

280
00:16:49,465 --> 00:16:58,841

282
00:16:58,841 --> 00:17:03,946

284
00:17:03,946 --> 00:17:09,084
MOM, WE'RE SORRY.

285

I GUESS WE GOT CARRIED AWAY.

286
00:17:03,946 --> 00:17:09,084

287
00:17:09,084 --> 00:17:14,056
THE STORE.

288

00:18:26,929 --> 00:18:30,899

324
00:18:26,929 --> 00:18:30,899
CAN WE GET TO THE TASTING?

325
00:18:26,929 --> 00:18:30,899
OKAY, I'M SORRY.

326
00:18:30,899 --> 00:18:36,071
HEY.

327
00:18:30,899 --> 00:18:36,071

THEY GOTTA TELL A JOKE OR TWO,

330
00:18:36,071 --> 00:18:51,220
LET THEM.

331
00:18:36,071 --> 00:18:51,220
THIS IS THEIR DANCE, NOT YOURS.

332
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:53,255
DO YOU TWO KNOW EACH OTHER?

333
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:53,255
NO, MA'AM.

334
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:53,255
JUST HERE TO TRY SOME ICE CREAM,

335
00:18:53,255 --> 00:18:55,290
GET MY CHECK, AND BE ON MY WAY.

336
00:18:53,255 --> 00:18:55,290

337
00:18:53,255 --> 00:18:55,290

339
00:18:55,290 --> 00:18:57,426
OKAY, FUN.

340
00:18:55,290 --> 00:18:57,426
THE FIRST FLAVOR WE'RE GOING TO

341
00:18:57,426 --> 00:19:03,966
TRY TODAY IS PEANUT BRITTLE PIE

342
00:18:57,426 --> 00:19:03,966

SO GIVE THOSE A TRY.

344
00:19:03,966 --> 00:19:14,076
JACOB, HOW ABOUT YOU GO FIRST?

345
00:19:03,966 --> 00:19:14,076
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

346
00:19:03,966 --> 00:19:14,076
OH, WOW, IT'S DELICIOUS.

347
00:19:14,076 --> 00:19:23,819
YOU GREAT?

348
00:19:14,076 --> 00:19:23,819
WHAT ABOUT YOU, LISA?

349
00:19:14,076 --> 00:19:23,819
IT'S A LITTLE WET.

350
00:19:23,819 --> 00:19:26,121
BUT YUMMY. NOTED.

351
00:19:23,819 --> 00:19:26,121
BOBBI, WHAT DO YOU THINK?

352
00:19:26,121 --> 00:19:28,357
YOU KNOW WHAT THIS TASTES

353
00:19:26,121 --> 00:19:28,357
LIKE?

354
00:19:26,121 --> 00:19:28,357
YOU REMEMBER WHEN YOU WAS A KID,

355
00:19:28,357 --> 00:19:30,592
YOU'D BE PLAYING OUT IN ALL THE

356
00:19:28,357 --> 00:19:30,592
DIRTY BUCKETS LIKE A HOG?

357
00:19:28,357 --> 00:19:30,592
AND PAPPY'D CALL YOU IN TO WASH

358
00:19:30,592 --> 00:19:33,862
UP BECAUSE NANA SPENT THE LAST

359
00:19:30,592 --> 00:19:33,862
THREE HOURS CHURNING?

360
00:19:30,592 --> 00:19:33,862
THAT WOMAN WOULD CHURN TILL SHE

361
00:19:33,862 --> 00:19:40,569
WHIPPED.

362
00:19:33,862 --> 00:19:40,569
THE BLOOD FROM HER PALMS, LEGS,

363
00:19:33,862 --> 00:19:40,569
AND THE CARAMEL RIBBONS IN THE

364
00:19:40,569 --> 00:19:47,776
ICE CREAM.

365
00:19:40,569 --> 00:19:47,776
THIS IS THAT.

366
00:19:40,569 --> 00:19:47,776
THIS TASTES LIKE THAT.

367
00:19:47,776 --> 00:19:57,753
OH, THANK YOU.

368
00:19:47,776 --> 00:19:57,753
VERY DESCRIPTIVE.

369
00:19:47,776 --> 00:19:57,753
YOU'RE TRYING TO MAKE A GROWN

370
00:19:57,753 --> 00:20:06,228
WEAK, MISS?

371
00:19:57,753 --> 00:20:06,228
NO, I'M JUST TRYING TO EAT

372
00:19:57,753 --> 00:20:06,228
ICE CREAM, SIR.

373
00:20:06,228 --> 00:20:08,063
WHAT ABOUT YOU, MUTTON.

374
00:20:06,228 --> 00:20:08,063
WHAT DID YOU THINK OF THE PEANUT

375
00:20:06,228 --> 00:20:08,063
BRITTLE PIE?

376
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:10,432
I'LL SAY THIS.

377
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:10,432
REMEMBER WHEN YOU'D BE DOWN BY

378
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:10,432
THE POND ALL DAY, HANDS CUPPED

379
00:20:10,432 --> 00:20:15,471
TRYING TO CATCH ONE STUPID

380
00:20:10,432 --> 00:20:15,471
LITTLE TADPOLE?

381
00:20:10,432 --> 00:20:15,471
IT WOULD MEAN NOTHING TODAY, BUT

382
00:20:15,471 --> 00:20:25,547
BACK THEN, HELL, THAT TAD WAS

383
00:20:15,471 --> 00:20:25,547
KING CRAB.

384
00:20:15,471 --> 00:20:25,547
AND THEN SCOOTER'S MAMA, THE

385
00:20:25,547 --> 00:20:28,017
ONE WITH THE PRETTY TEETH AND

386
00:20:25,547 --> 00:20:28,017
EYES LIKE BUTTER, WHO'D INVITE

387
00:20:25,547 --> 00:20:28,017
YOU INSIDE FOR A BOWL OF ROCKY

388
00:20:28,017 --> 00:20:29,985
ROAD.

389
00:20:28,017 --> 00:20:29,985
DIDN'T MATTER THE FLAVOR, THOUGH.

390
00:20:29,985 --> 00:20:32,021
IT WAS JUST THAT A BEAUTIFUL,

391
00:20:29,985 --> 00:20:32,021
MATURE WOMAN HAD OPENED HER DOOR

392
00:20:29,985 --> 00:20:32,021
TO YOU.

393
00:20:32,021 --> 00:20:39,261
FARMER'S WIFE.

394
00:20:32,021 --> 00:20:39,261
BOSOM HEAVY.

395
00:20:32,021 --> 00:20:39,261
THIS IS THAT.

396
00:20:39,261 --> 00:20:48,237
THIS TASTES LIKE THAT. OKAY.

397
00:20:39,261 --> 00:20:48,237
TASTES LIKE SCOOTER'S MAMA.

398
00:20:48,237 --> 00:20:55,444
WRITING THAT DOWN.

399
00:20:48,237 --> 00:20:55,444
YOU'VE SEEN THINGS, HAVEN'T

400
00:20:48,237 --> 00:20:55,444
YOU?

401
00:20:55,444 --> 00:20:59,415
NAH.

402
00:20:55,444 --> 00:20:59,415
ONLY ICE CREAM, MISS.

403
00:20:55,444 --> 00:20:59,415
HEY, MAN.

404
00:20:59,415 --> 00:21:10,893
I JUST TASTE ICE CREAM.

405
00:20:59,415 --> 00:21:10,893
AM I DOING THIS WRONG?

406
00:20:59,415 --> 00:21:10,893
NO.

407
00:21:10,893 --> 00:21:12,695
GUYS, WE'RE NOT REALLY LOOKING

408
00:21:10,893 --> 00:21:12,695
TO TASTE MEMORIES OF THE DUST

409
00:21:10,893 --> 00:21:12,695
BOWL HERE.

410
00:21:12,695 --> 00:21:14,596
YOUR ICE CREAM CARRIES A

411
00:21:12,695 --> 00:21:14,596
WEIGHT TO IT, SIR.

412
00:21:12,695 --> 00:21:14,596
SHE'S RIGHT.

413
00:21:14,596 --> 00:21:25,474
I CAN TASTE GENERATIONS OF WOMEN

414
00:21:14,596 --> 00:21:25,474
IN IT. YEAH.

415
00:21:25,474 --> 00:21:27,643
WILL NOT BE WRITING THAT DOWN.

416
00:21:25,474 --> 00:21:27,643
HOW ABOUT THIS ONE.

417
00:21:25,474 --> 00:21:27,643
GALACTIC MINT FROST.

418
00:21:27,643 --> 00:21:30,913
WHY DON'T YOU ALL GIVE THAT ONE

419
00:21:27,643 --> 00:21:30,913
A LITTLE TASTE. YEAH.

420
00:21:30,913 --> 00:21:34,083
BOBBI, YOU TASTING THAT FRESH

421
00:21:30,913 --> 00:21:34,083
MINT IN THERE?

422
00:21:30,913 --> 00:21:34,083
NO.

423
00:21:34,083 --> 00:21:41,090
TASTES MORE LIKE WIND.

424
00:21:34,083 --> 00:21:41,090
LIKE THE WIND WHEN YOU HAVEN'T

425
00:21:34,083 --> 00:21:41,090
QUITE REACHED 5 FEET TALL.

426
00:21:41,090 --> 00:21:46,095
WIND BACK THEN WOULD KNOCK YOU

427
00:21:41,090 --> 00:21:46,095
RIGHT INTO YOUR NEIGHBOR.

428
00:21:41,090 --> 00:21:46,095
THE ONE THAT HAD LOST HIS WIFE

429
00:21:46,095 --> 00:21:50,399
AND DAUGHTER IN THE HOSPITAL FIRE.

430
00:21:46,095 --> 00:21:50,399
AND IN YOUR EYES, HE SAW THEM

431
00:21:50,399 --> 00:21:58,440
BOTH.

432
00:21:50,399 --> 00:21:58,440
SO YOU'D SIT WITH HIM ON THE

433
00:21:50,399 --> 00:21:58,440
PORCH WATCHING THE WORLD GO BY.

434
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:02,778
JUST AS THE SUN WENT DOWN, HE'D

435
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:02,778
HAND YOU A BOWL OF CREAM.

436
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:02,778
JUST VANILLA, THOUGH.

437
00:22:02,778 --> 00:22:11,787
HE KEPT IT SIMPLE SINCE THE

438
00:22:02,778 --> 00:22:11,787
GIRLS HAD DIED.

439
00:22:02,778 --> 00:22:11,787
THIS IS THAT.

440
00:22:11,787 --> 00:22:22,064
THIS TASTES LIKE THAT.

441
00:22:11,787 --> 00:22:22,064
GOT IT.

442
00:22:11,787 --> 00:22:22,064
SO IT TASTES LIKE A WIDOWER IN

443
00:22:22,064 --> 00:22:24,133
PAIN.

444
00:22:22,064 --> 00:22:24,133
WHO HURT YOU?

445
00:22:22,064 --> 00:22:24,133
WHY, YOU LOOKING TO SAVE

446
00:22:24,133 --> 00:22:30,072
SOMEONE TONIGHT?

447
00:22:24,133 --> 00:22:30,072
MAYBE.

448
00:22:24,133 --> 00:22:30,072
EAT YOUR ICE CREAM.

449
00:22:30,072 --> 00:22:32,875
I'M SORRY, WHAT IS HAPPENING?

450
00:22:30,072 --> 00:22:32,875
YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT I

451
00:22:30,072 --> 00:22:32,875
TASTE?

452
00:22:32,875 --> 00:22:35,744
YES, BUT IN LIKE SIX WORDS

453
00:22:32,875 --> 00:22:35,744
THIS TIME. FINE.

454
00:22:35,744 --> 00:22:42,851
REMEMBER THE FOURTH OF JULY --

455
00:22:35,744 --> 00:22:42,851
OKAY, PLEASE STOP.

456
00:22:35,744 --> 00:22:42,851
THE AIR WAS SO THICK WITH

457
00:22:42,851 --> 00:22:45,688
SMOKE, YOU COULD BARELY FIND

458
00:22:42,851 --> 00:22:45,688
YOUR LITTLE BROTHER'S HAND.

459
00:22:42,851 --> 00:22:45,688
DADDY LET YOU BOTH STAY OUT LATE

460
00:22:45,688 --> 00:22:51,427
AS LONG AS YOU KEPT YOUR LITTLE

461
00:22:45,688 --> 00:22:51,427
BROTHER CLOSE.

462
00:22:45,688 --> 00:22:51,427
NEVER DID FIND HIM.

463
00:22:51,427 --> 00:23:02,237
WALKED HOME ALONE, WENT STRAIGHT

464
00:22:51,427 --> 00:23:02,237
TO THE ICEBOX, SCOOPED

465
00:22:51,427 --> 00:23:02,237

466
00:23:02,237 --> 00:23:03,906
FANCY ON THE NIGHT YOUR BROTHER DISAPPEARED.

467
00:23:02,237 --> 00:23:03,906
THIS IS THAT.

468
00:23:03,906 --> 00:23:09,678
THIS TASTES LIKE THAT.

469
00:23:03,906 --> 00:23:09,678
DAMMIT, I CAN'T TAKE YOUR

470
00:23:03,906 --> 00:23:09,678
PAIN AWAY BUT I CAN GIVE IT A

471
00:23:09,678 --> 00:23:18,654
BED TO REST IN.

472
00:23:09,678 --> 00:23:18,654
LET ME NAP WITH YOUR HURT.

473
00:23:09,678 --> 00:23:18,654
YOU WANT TO NAP WITH MY HURT?

474
00:23:18,654 --> 00:23:25,327
I SAID AS MUCH.

475
00:23:18,654 --> 00:23:25,327
LET ME NAP WITH YOUR HURT!

476
00:23:18,654 --> 00:23:25,327
DON'T SAY SOMETHING LIKE

477
00:23:25,327 --> 00:23:31,834
THAT, YOU MIGHT JUST END UP

478
00:23:25,327 --> 00:23:31,834
TAKING A NAP WITH MY HURT.

479
00:23:25,327 --> 00:23:31,834
ALL RIGHT!

480
00:23:31,834 --> 00:23:32,076
WELL, THANKS FOR COMING OUT, EVERYBODY.

481
00:23:41,174 --> 00:23:44,159
JUST LIKE YOU

482
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:47,987
NO PHONE.
YOU'RE GROUNDED, REMEMBER?

483
00:23:47,987 --> 00:23:52,073
OH, MY GOD, I DIDN'T EVEN DO
ANYTHING THAT BAD, MOM.

484
00:23:52,073 --> 00:23:55,232
REALLY?
TAYLOR, YOU CAME HOME DRUNK.

485
00:23:55,232 --> 00:23:56,731
YOU'RE 17 YEARS OLD.

486
00:23:56,731 --> 00:23:59,741
OH, COME ON, LIKE YOU NEVER
DRANK WHEN YOU WERE MY AGE?

487
00:23:59,741 --> 00:24:01,449
IN HIGH SCHOOL, NO.

821
00:37:46,844 --> 00:37:50,043
ONE
FOR EACH BEER IN THE PACK.

822
00:37:50,043 --> 00:37:52,876
HE EVEN CITES KAVANAUGH ON CIVIL RIGHTS,

823
00:37:52,876 --> 00:37:56,766
WHICH IS LIKE CITING
AMBER HEARD ON HOW TO MAKE A BED.

824
00:38:01,223 --> 00:38:07,248
CHIEF JUSTICE JOHN ROBERTS SAID
THE LEAK WAS THE WORK OF "ONE
BAD APPLE."

825
00:38:07,248 --> 00:38:12,239
ONE BAD APPLE IS ALSO A LEGAL
ARGUMENT CITED IN ALITO'S
OPINION.

826
00:38:14,854 --> 00:38:19,847
AS A MAN THERE'S NO WAY I CAN
UNDERSTAND THE FULL IMPACT OF
THIS ISSUE.

827
00:38:19,847 --> 00:38:24,660
BUT I ASKED A BUNCH OF WOMEN
AROUND THE OFFICE WHAT THEIR
PERSONAL EXPERIENCE WAS WITH
ABORTION.

828
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:29,899
AND I GOTTA ADMIT, I LEARNED A
LOT FROM THE HR MEETING THEY
MADE ME GO TO AFTER.

829
00:38:30,910 --> 00:38:35,472
I DO KNOW THIS RULING WILL HAVE
A DISPROPORTIONATE EFFECT ON
POOR PEOPLE.

830
00:38:35,607 --> 00:38:39,092
MOST AMERICANS DON'T HAVE ACCESS
TO THE SAME RESOURCES THAT EVEN
I DO.

831
00:38:39,092 --> 00:38:42,263
THE AVERAGE PERSON CAN'T JUST
TEXT LORNE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

832
00:38:42,354 --> 00:38:44,783
AND SAY, "YO, IT HAPPENED
AGAIN."

833
00:38:45,257 --> 00:38:48,023
ARE SO AGAINST THIS.

834
00:38:48,023 --> 00:38:50,324
I MEAN, MAYBE DON'T THINK OF IT
AS AN ABORTION,

835
00:38:50,324 --> 00:38:52,574
THINK OF IT AS A
PATRIOT STORMING THE UTERUS

836
00:38:52,574 --> 00:38:56,770
TO
OVERTURN THE RESULTS OF A PREGNANCY.

837
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:06,672
FORMER NEW YORK CITY MAYOR
AND CURRENT RUMPLE STILT SKIN
RUDY GIULIANI

838
00:39:06,672 --> 00:39:11,116
CANCELED AN
LAST MINUTE FRIDAY

842
00:39:24,632 --> 00:39:29,564
I NEVER THOUGHT I'D SAY THIS,
BUT GOOD LUCK, CANCER

843
00:39:43,036 --> 00:39:56,652
HERE WITH US IS AMY CONEY BARRETT.

844
00:39:50,779 --> 00:39:56,652
THANKS FOR BEING HERE.

845
00:39:56,652 --> 00:40:02,858
I'M JAZZED AND JUICED.

846
00:39:56,652 --> 00:40:02,858
I WOULD IMAGINE YOU'RE HAPPY

847
00:39:56,652 --> 00:40:02,858
WITH THE RULING.

848
00:40:02,858 --> 00:40:11,567
I DON'T KNOW WHAT WOULD MAKE

849
00:40:02,858 --> 00:40:11,567
YOU THINK THAT.

850
00:40:02,858 --> 00:40:11,567
I LISTENED TO THE CASE AND ASKED

851
00:40:11,567 --> 00:40:16,505
ALL MY QUESTIONS.

852
00:40:11,567 --> 00:40:16,505
YOU WERE ASKING ABOUT SAFE

853
00:40:11,567 --> 00:40:16,505
HAVEN LAWS WHERE CAN YOU LEGALLY

854
00:40:16,505 --> 00:40:23,045
LEAVE A BABY AT A FIRE STATION,

855
00:40:16,505 --> 00:40:23,045
NO QUESTIONS ASKED.

856
00:40:16,505 --> 00:40:23,045
I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY

857
00:40:23,045 --> 00:40:26,615
YOU NEED ABORTION, BECAUSE YOU

858
00:40:23,045 --> 00:40:26,615
CAN LEAVE A BABY ANYWHERE IN THE

859
00:40:23,045 --> 00:40:26,615
UNITED STATES.

860
00:40:26,615 --> 00:40:34,790
WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?

861
00:40:26,615 --> 00:40:34,790
JUST POP IT.

862
00:40:26,615 --> 00:40:34,790
JUST DO THE NINE AND PLUS.

863
00:40:34,790 --> 00:40:41,196
JUST DOT NINE AND WHAT?

864
00:40:34,790 --> 00:40:41,196
DO YOUR NINE, LEAVE IT ON THE

865
00:40:34,790 --> 00:40:41,196
SIDEWALK, WRAP IT UP IN, LIKE A

866
00:40:41,196 --> 00:40:47,970
LITTLE MOSES, PUT IT IN A

867
00:40:41,196 --> 00:40:47,970
BASKET, DO YOUR NINE.

868
00:40:41,196 --> 00:40:47,970
IT'S SIMPLE.

869
00:40:47,970 --> 00:40:59,248
YOU ARE AN AMURDERER IF YOU HAVE

870
00:40:47,970 --> 00:40:59,248
AN ABORTION, BUT ARE YOU NOT A

871
00:40:47,970 --> 00:40:59,248
MURDERER IF YOU PUT A BABY IN A

872
00:40:59,248 --> 00:41:06,255
MAILBOX.

873
00:40:59,248 --> 00:41:06,255
NOT EVERYONE IS GOOD WITH THAT.

874
00:41:06,255 --> 00:41:22,104
GIVE IT TO A STORK AND A

875
00:41:06,255 --> 00:41:22,104
STORK WILL GIVE IT TO LESBIAN.

876
00:41:06,255 --> 00:41:22,104
I HAVE SEVEN CHILDREN AND A JOB.

877
00:41:22,104 --> 00:41:30,179
AND I MAKE IT WORK.

878
00:41:22,104 --> 00:41:30,179
WHY EVERY SINGLE OTHER WOMAN

879
00:41:22,104 --> 00:41:30,179
CAN'T GET IT DONE IS BEYOND ME.

880
00:41:30,179 --> 00:41:38,787
ARE YOU ALSO SUGGESTS WE

881
00:41:30,179 --> 00:41:38,787
DON'T NEED ABORTION BECAUSE

882
00:41:30,179 --> 00:41:38,787
THERES NO LONGER THE SAME SIGMA

883
00:41:38,787 --> 00:41:43,258
AGAINST UNWED MOTHERS. EXACTLY.

884
00:41:38,787 --> 00:41:43,258
YOU SEE A GIRL WHO'S PREGNANT.

885
00:41:43,258 --> 00:41:49,331
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO STONE HER ANYMORE.

886
00:41:43,258 --> 00:41:49,331
IF YOU GET PREGNANT AND YOU'RE

887
00:41:49,331 --> 00:41:59,408
NOT MARRIED, YOU DON'T HAVE TO

888
00:41:49,331 --> 00:41:59,408
GO TO A CONVENT ANYMORE.

889
00:41:49,331 --> 00:41:59,408
THAT'S YOUR NINE.

890
00:41:59,408 --> 00:42:06,648
SAFELY ENDING AN EARLY PREGNANCY

891
00:41:59,408 --> 00:42:06,648
OR GIVE BIRTH TO A BABY YOU CAN

892
00:41:59,408 --> 00:42:06,648
NEVER SEE AGAIN BECAUSE YOU PUT

893
00:42:06,648 --> 00:42:14,123
IT ON A FERRIS WHEEL.

894
00:42:06,648 --> 00:42:14,123
THESE LESBIANS WILL BE HAVING A

895
00:42:06,648 --> 00:42:14,123
CRAP LOAD OF BABIES COMING THEIR

896
00:42:14,123 --> 00:42:20,329
WAY.

897
00:42:14,123 --> 00:42:20,329
THEY SHOULD BE KISSING ME.

898
00:42:14,123 --> 00:42:20,329
I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD

899
00:42:20,329 --> 00:42:25,668
FORCE YOUR CONSERVATIVE VIEWS ON

900
00:42:20,329 --> 00:42:25,668
THE COUNTRY.

901
00:42:20,329 --> 00:42:25,668
THE COURT IS NOT PARTISAN.

902
00:42:25,668 --> 00:42:38,447
OUR SPOUSES ON THE OTHER HAND

903
00:42:25,668 --> 00:42:38,447
ARE EFFING CRAZY.

904
00:42:25,668 --> 00:42:38,447
SPEAK OF, CLARENCE THOMAS' WIFE

905
00:42:38,447 --> 00:42:48,257
GINNI IS IN LOVE WITH ME, OKAY,

906
00:42:38,447 --> 00:42:48,257
LOVE, YOU WANT A BABE SNEE.

907
00:42:38,447 --> 00:42:48,257
IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE YOU'D

908
00:42:48,257 --> 00:42:57,266
LIKE TO SAY?

909
00:42:48,257 --> 00:42:57,266
ARBY'S, WE HAVE THE BABIES.

910
00:42:48,257 --> 00:42:57,266
DO YOUR NINE!

911
00:43:01,670 --> 00:43:11,080
A NEW REPORT SHOWS THAT HALF

912
00:43:01,670 --> 00:43:11,080
AMERICANS IDENTIFY AS AFRO LATINOS.

913
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:16,051
THAT'S WHAT BRUNO MARS CALLS HIS COSTUMES.

914
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:16,051
NEW YORK CITY HAS LAUNCHED A

915
00:43:16,051 --> 00:43:21,890
NEW CAMPAIGN TO STOP SPEEDING IN

916
00:43:16,051 --> 00:43:21,890
THE CITY WITH A SERIES OF SIGNS

917
00:43:21,890 --> 00:43:25,761
DESIGNED TO SCARE DRIVERS.

918
00:43:21,890 --> 00:43:25,761
THE SIGNS READ SIMPLY "ENTERING

919
00:43:21,890 --> 00:43:25,761
NEW JERSEY."

920
00:43:30,132 --> 00:43:37,072

WHAT IS ROCK 'N ROLL?

925
00:43:37,072 --> 00:43:44,713
A BAT USED BY JACKIE ROBINSON

926
00:43:44,713 --> 00:43:52,554
WAS SOLD FOR $1 MILLION.

927
00:43:44,713 --> 00:43:52,554
IT IS CONSIDERED SO VALUABLE

928
00:43:44,713 --> 00:43:52,554
BECAUSE HE USED IT IN THE GAME

929
00:43:52,554 --> 00:44:06,769
BUT ALSO TO GET BACK TO LIIS CAR SAFELY.

930

19 HOURS.

936

YOU CAN STILL CHANGE YOUR MIND.

1020
00:48:03,172 --> 00:48:08,977
NO, AMELIA, THE DIE IS CAST.

1021

1358
01:03:42,891 --> 01:03:46,102
YOU HAVE TO
SHADOW THEM AS THEY GO ABOUT
