1
00:00:05,038 --> 00:00:07,366
>>> MR. PRESIDENT --

2
00:00:13,507 --> 00:00:17,126
THE SITUATION IN UKRAINE IS
GROWING TENSER BY THE HOUR.

3
00:00:17,126 --> 00:00:19,981
PUTIN HAS AMASSED OVER
100,000 TROOPS AT THE BORDER.

4
00:00:19,981 --> 00:00:24,030
>> WE'RE EVEN GETTING SOME
REPORTS THAT RUSSIA HAS ALREADY INVADED

5
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:26,968
BUT THOSE ARE FROM THE
SAME PEOPLE WHO SAID TOM BRADY
RETIRED

6
00:00:26,968 --> 00:00:29,264
SO TAKE IT WE THE GRAIN
OF SALT.

7
00:00:29,264 --> 00:00:33,628
>> WHAT ABOUT THE NATO FORCE?
ARE THEY READY TO BACK US UP?

8
00:00:33,628 --> 00:00:36,141
>> EVERY COUNTRY IS SENDING
SUPPLIES TO UKRAINE

9
00:00:36,141 --> 00:00:38,179
EXCEPT
GERMANY.
THEY'RE STAYING OUT OF IT.

10
00:00:38,179 --> 00:00:43,033
>> IF GERMANY DOESN'T WANT TO GO
TO WAR, YOU KNOW IT'S BAD.

11
00:00:43,033 --> 00:00:47,794
>> RUSSIA'S MILITARY MAY BE THE
WORST OF OUR PROBLEMS.

12
00:00:47,794 --> 00:00:51,318
>> WE HAVE BEEN TRACKING THE
SPREAD OF RUSSIAN DISINFORMATION,

13
00:00:51,318 --> 00:00:55,158
AND THERE ARE
SOME LIES UKRAINIANS DON'T KNOW
WHO TO BELIEVE ANYMORE.

14
00:00:55,158 --> 00:00:59,241
>> RUSSIA TRIED THAT DURING OR
LAST ELECTION, TOO, BUT IT
DIDN'T WORK.

15
00:00:59,241 --> 00:01:02,900
>> 40% OF AMERICANS THINK YOU
LOST THE ELECTION,

16
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:05,096
SO IT KIND OF
DID.

17
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:10,731
>>TAKE A LOOK AT THE POSTS THAT
ARE CIRCULATING ON UKRAINIAN
FACEBOOK.

18
00:01:11,136 --> 00:01:15,647
"UKRAINIAN BORDER ENCROACHING ON
RUSSIAN TROOPS."

19
00:01:15,647 --> 00:01:20,731
>> "RUSSIAN FORCES SURROUNDING
UKRAINE JUST TO GIVE IT BIG
HUG."

20
00:01:20,731 --> 00:01:24,288
>> "UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT HORNY
FOR DRAMA.

21
00:01:24,288 --> 00:01:27,951
WANT WAR.
SLAP ME HARDER, DADDY."

22
00:01:27,951 --> 00:01:31,257
>> I'M GOING TO BREAK MY NEW
YEAR'S RESOLUTION AND SAY IT --

23
00:01:31,257 --> 00:01:33,197
LORDY.

24
00:01:33,197 --> 00:01:35,980
>> THEY'RE ALSO BRINGING OUR
COUNTRY INTO IT.

25
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:40,387
"AMERICAN CDC STRONGLY
RECOMMENDS RUSSIA INVADES
UKRAINE."

26
00:01:40,387 --> 00:01:42,661
>> DID THE CDC REALLY RECOMMEND
THAT?

27
00:01:42,661 --> 00:01:45,076
>> YEAH, FOR A FEW MONTHS IN
2020.

28
00:01:45,076 --> 00:01:47,822
THE SCIENCE WAS CHANGING SO
FAST.

29
00:01:47,822 --> 00:01:53,299
>> THERE'S ALSO THIS --
"NEIL YOUNG TO REMOVE MUSIC FROM SPOTIFY

30
00:01:53,299 --> 00:01:55,416
UNLESS UKRAINE
SURRENDERS."

31
00:01:55,416 --> 00:01:58,207
>> AND THIS ONE IS UNBELIEVABLE.

32
00:01:58,207 --> 00:02:01,268
"ARE YOU A LONELY UKRAINIAN
WOMAN IN SEARCH OF A GUY?

33
00:02:01,268 --> 00:02:04,549
100,000 TROOPS ARE STANDING BY
TO TALK TO YOU

34
00:02:04,549 --> 00:02:07,470
AT SOLDIERSONLY.COM."

35
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:12,177
>> MY GOD.
I MEAN, IT IS A GOOD IDEA FOR A
WEB SIDE.

36
00:02:12,177 --> 00:02:16,149
>> THEY'RE TURNING OUR MOST
BELOVED HEROES AGAINST US.

37
00:02:16,149 --> 00:02:18,602
"I DON'T ALWAYS GET INVADED

38
00:02:18,602 --> 00:02:21,442
BUT WHEN I DO, I PREFER RUSSIA."

39
00:02:21,442 --> 00:02:23,407
>> NOT TO MENTION THIS --

40
00:02:23,407 --> 00:02:27,315
"WHY I GOT TO BE UKRAINIAN WHEN RUSSIA
TWO FEET AWAY".

41
00:02:27,315 --> 00:02:32,552
NOTHING SACRED TO THEM, NOT EVEN
GUY CHECK OUT HOT GIRL.

42
00:02:32,552 --> 00:02:34,721
>> IT'S NOT ONLY MEMES.

43
00:02:34,721 --> 00:02:38,745
LOOK AT THIS VIDEO A RUSSIAN SPY
POSTED ON TIKTOK.

44
00:02:38,745 --> 00:02:44,243
UKRAINE

45
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:51,128
RUSSIA

46
00:02:52,641 --> 00:02:54,723
>> WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?

47
00:02:54,723 --> 00:02:59,304
>> SIR, IT'S A VIDEO WITH
8.7 MILLION VIEWS.

48
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:01,844
>> NO, NO, I MEAN WHAT THE HELL
WAS THAT DANCING?

49
00:03:01,844 --> 00:03:04,509
THE CHOREOGRAPHY WASN'T EVEN
CRISP.

50
00:03:04,509 --> 00:03:08,752
I'VE GOT LOG IN AND FLAME THOSE
GUYS IN MY COMMENTS.

51
00:03:08,752 --> 00:03:12,204
>> UNFORTUNATELY, MR. PRESIDENT,
THIS GOES BEYOND SOCIAL MEDIA.

52
00:03:12,204 --> 00:03:15,890
LOOK AT THIS COMMERCIAL AIRING
ON UKRAINIAN MTV.

53
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:18,666
>> I CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE.

54
00:03:18,666 --> 00:03:23,600
I'M TYPICAL UKRAINIAN TEENAGER
AND HAVE NO HOPE FOR MY FUTURE.

55
00:03:23,601 --> 00:03:25,559
SEAS

56
00:03:25,559 --> 00:03:29,161
THAT'S WHY I'M THINKING OF
GOING RUSSIA.

57
00:03:29,161 --> 00:03:33,279
>> RUSSIA?
YOU MEAN THE LAND OF WEALTH AND
FREEDOM?

58
00:03:33,279 --> 00:03:37,511
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
I HEAR YOU CAN GET A JOB IN
RUSSIA RIGHT AWAY,

59
00:03:37,511 --> 00:03:39,948
MINING
ARSENIC AND POTASH.

60
00:03:39,948 --> 00:03:45,024
WHATEVER YOU DON'T USE FOR
FERTILIZER YOU CAN GOAT EAT.

61
00:03:45,025 --> 00:03:46,516
IN

62
00:03:46,516 --> 00:03:49,846
>> BUT RUSSIA IS TOO POPULARLE
WE'LL NEVER GET IN.

63
00:03:49,846 --> 00:03:52,500
>> YOU'RE RIGHT.
IF ONLY RUSSIA --

64
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,738
COME TO US.

65
00:03:54,738 --> 00:03:58,156
>> STUDENTS FOR THE RUSSIAN
NATION OF UKRAINE.

66
00:03:58,156 --> 00:04:01,128
CUZ

67
00:04:01,128 --> 00:04:02,850
>> THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

68
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:05,766
NOW, WHICH ONE OF THOSE TWO WAS
ZENDAYA?

69
00:04:05,766 --> 00:04:10,837
>> SIR, THESE PRO RUSSIA
COMMERCIALS ARE SATURATING
UKRAINIAN TELEVISION.

70
00:04:10,837 --> 00:04:12,643
I MEAN, LOOK AT THIS ONE.

71
00:04:12,643 --> 00:04:18,430
>> OH, NO, I AM AMERICAN
BALLPLAYER AARON RODGERS,

72
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:21,955
AND MY
CAR HAS BROKEN DOWN IN UKRAINE.

73
00:04:21,955 --> 00:04:24,150
ONLY ONE THING DO.

74
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:27,269
LIKE A GOOD NEIGHBOR, RUSSIA IS
THERE.

75
00:04:27,269 --> 00:04:30,126
HELLO TO YOU, AARON RODGERS.
NEED SOME HELP.

76
00:04:30,126 --> 00:04:34,238
>> JAKE FROM RUSSIA.
CAN YOU GET ME OUT OF UKRAINE?

77
00:04:34,238 --> 00:04:36,867
>> OF COURSE.
WILL I TAKE TO YOU MEET OUR
PRESIDENT.

78
00:04:36,867 --> 00:04:41,098
HE WOULD LOVE TO SEE YOUR SUPER
BOWL RING AND MAYBE HOLD IT FOR
A WHILE?

79
00:04:42,171 --> 00:04:45,346
>> LIKE A GOOD NEIGHBOR, YOU ARE
IN RUSSIA.

80
00:04:45,346 --> 00:04:47,059
>> THERE YOU GO.

81
00:04:47,688 --> 00:04:53,181
>> YOU'RE TELLING ME UKRAINIANS
ARE SUPPOSED TO BELIEVE THAT'S
THE REAL AARON ROGERS?

82
00:04:53,181 --> 00:04:56,836
>> APPARENTLY THAT IS THE REAL
AARON RODGERS.

83
00:04:56,836 --> 00:04:59,234
I GUESS HE LEFT TO PACKERS TO
PLAY IN RUSSIA.

84
00:04:59,234 --> 00:05:02,960
>> WHAT CAN WE DO TO FIGHT BACK
AGAINST ALL THIS PROPAGANDA?

85
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,620
>> WELL, WE HAVE TO FIGHT FIRE
WITH FIRE.

86
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:10,149
THAT'S WHY I'D LIKE TO INTRODUCE
YOU TO OUR NEW SECRETARY OF
DEFENSE, MAKAYLA.

87
00:05:10,149 --> 00:05:12,096
>> HI.

88
00:05:12,096 --> 00:05:15,294
I'M MAKAYLA, SPELLED THE WORST
WAY.

89
00:05:15,294 --> 00:05:18,571
I'M A JUNIOR AT A VICIOUS GIRLS
HIGH SCHOOL,

90
00:05:18,571 --> 00:05:21,090
AND Y'ALL WORK FOR
ME NOW.

91
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:25,437
>> HOLD ON.
THE CIA MUST HAVE OPERATIVES ON
SOCIAL MEDIA ALREADY.

92
00:05:25,437 --> 00:05:28,447
>> OH, THEY DO, AND IT'S ROUGH.

93
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:31,017
LOOK AT WHAT YOUR AGENTS MADE.

94
00:05:31,017 --> 00:05:32,913
"I LIKE DEMOCRACY.

95
00:05:32,913 --> 00:05:35,886
THEN DON'T SIDE WITH ME I'M
RUSSIA?"

96
00:05:35,886 --> 00:05:39,749
>> OH, MY GOD.

97
00:05:39,749 --> 00:05:42,630
>> I KNOW.

98
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:46,249
THE ONLY THING MORE PATHETIC WAS
THEIR ATTEMPT AT TIKTOK.

99
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:50,919
URK2021

100
00:05:50,919 --> 00:05:54,843
URK2022

101
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:57,378
>> WHAT DOES THAT EVEN MEAN?

102
00:05:57,378 --> 00:06:02,248
IT ALMOST LOOKS LIKE IF RUSSIA
INVADES IT WOULD TURN OLD
UKRAINIAN WOMEN INTO SEXY
NURSES.

103
00:06:02,248 --> 00:06:06,007
>> LET'S DO SOMETHING FUN
EVERYONE CAN GET BY,

104
00:06:06,007 --> 00:06:08,067
LIKE A
DRONE STRIKE.

105
00:06:08,067 --> 00:06:12,667
>> I THINK YOUR GENERATION CAN
LEARN A LOT FROM MINE.

106
00:06:12,667 --> 00:06:15,200
LIKE, WE DON'T BELIEVE IN DRONE
STRIKES.

107
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:18,671
WE BELIEVE IN BREAKING DOWN OUR
ENEMIES PSYCHOLOGICALLY.

108
00:06:18,671 --> 00:06:21,584
THAT'S WHY I'M GOING TO DM PUTIN AND SAY,

109
00:06:21,584 --> 00:06:24,379
OH, MY GOD, I LOVED
YOUR OUTFIT THE OTHER DAY.

110
00:06:24,379 --> 00:06:26,253
WAS THAT OLD NAVY?

111
00:06:26,253 --> 00:06:29,591
ALREADY HE'S SPIRALING.

112
00:06:29,591 --> 00:06:32,466
HE'S LIKE, "DO THEY THINK I'M
POOR?"

113
00:06:32,466 --> 00:06:35,772
IN THREE WEEKS, I WILL HAVE HIM
DROPPING OUT OF RUSSIA.

114
00:06:35,772 --> 00:06:37,278
>> HAVE YOU DONE THIS BEFORE?

115
00:06:37,278 --> 00:06:41,057
>> DOES THE NAME GIULIANI RING A
BELL

116
00:06:42,721 --> 00:06:47,408
>> LIVE FROM NEW YORK, IT'S
SATURDAY NIGHT!

117
00:08:57,793 --> 00:09:02,574
WILLEM DAFOE.

118
00:09:17,742 --> 00:09:20,406
>> THANK YOU.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

119
00:09:20,406 --> 00:09:22,992
IT'S GREAT TO BE BACK HOME IN
NEW YORK.

120
00:09:22,992 --> 00:09:25,478
THIS IS WHERE I STARTED.

121
00:09:26,864 --> 00:09:30,420
I MOVED HERE WHEN I WAS 21.
HAD NO MONEY

122
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:35,284
AND RENTED AN
APARTMENT ON 10th AND AVENUE
A FOR 200 BUCKS A MONTH.

123
00:09:35,284 --> 00:09:37,514
THAT'S WHERE I LEARNED HOW TO
ACT.

124
00:09:37,514 --> 00:09:40,392
FOR EXAMPLE, I HAD TO ACT

125
00:09:40,392 --> 00:09:44,106
LIKE I ENJOYED HAVING A BATHTUB IN MY
KITCHEN.

126
00:09:44,106 --> 00:09:47,269
I GOT STARTED IN EXPERIMENTAL
THEATER.

127
00:09:47,269 --> 00:09:50,544
I WAS AN ORIGINAL MEMBER OF THE
WOOSTER GROUP.

128
00:09:52,326 --> 00:09:57,018
AND THAT BACKGROUND REALLY
TAUGHT ME HOW TO THROW MYSELF
INTO A ROLE.

129
00:09:57,018 --> 00:10:00,908
SOME PEOPLE TELL ME THAT MY
ACTING IS OVER THE TOP,

130
00:10:00,908 --> 00:10:04,177
BUT TO
ME, ONE MAN'S OVER THE TOP

131
00:10:04,177 --> 00:10:07,014
IS
ANOTHER MAN'S ENGAGED
PERFORMANCE.

132
00:10:07,014 --> 00:10:10,887
FOR INSTANCE, IN THIS SCENE,
PEOPLE ASSUME

133
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:15,351
I'M ABOUT TO TOSS
SOMEBODY OFF A BUILDING.

134
00:10:15,351 --> 00:10:20,347
WHEN IN REALITY, I WAS JUST
READING A REALLY GOOD BOOK.

135
00:10:22,225 --> 00:10:25,480
LOOK, I CAN'T HELP THAT I HAVE
AN EXPRESSIVE FACE.

136
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,938
I CAN'T CONTROL IT.

137
00:10:26,938 --> 00:10:29,212
I DON'T THINK ABOUT CONTROLLING
IT.

138
00:10:29,212 --> 00:10:31,219
I'M NOT ONE OF THOSE SUBTLE ACTORS,

139
00:10:31,219 --> 00:10:34,758
LIKE NICOLAS CAGE OR
AL PACINO.

140
00:10:35,329 --> 00:10:38,581
MAYBE THAT'S WHY PEOPLE COME UP
TO ME AND SAY,

141
00:10:38,581 --> 00:10:42,932
"YOU KNOW WHAT
ROLE YOU'D BE PERFECT FOR?
THE JOKER."

142
00:10:42,932 --> 00:10:48,123
ALWAYS NICE TO HEAR THAT YOU GOT
THE VIBE OF A SOCIOPATH.

143
00:10:48,123 --> 00:10:53,581
LISTEN, I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL
FOR COMING OUT IN THIS
SNOWSTORM.

144
00:10:58,185 --> 00:11:02,265
YOU KNOW, WHEN I WAS A KID IN
APPLETON, WISCONSIN, WINTERS
WERE --

145
00:11:02,265 --> 00:11:07,065
>> EXCUSE ME.
DID SOMEONE SAY APPLETON,
WISCONSIN?

146
00:11:07,065 --> 00:11:08,636
>> YEAH, I DID.

147
00:11:08,636 --> 00:11:13,295
>> WELL, YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO
BELIEVE THIS, BUT WE'RE FROM
APPLETON, TOO.

148
00:11:13,295 --> 00:11:15,877
>> YEP.
BORN AND RAISED.

149
00:11:15,877 --> 00:11:19,117
>> THAT'S NICE.
YOU CAME HERE TO SUPPORT ONE OF
YOUR OWN.

150
00:11:19,117 --> 00:11:22,610
>> NO.
NO.
WE GOT TICKETS FROM THE LOTTERY.

151
00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:25,408
>> YEAH.
HAD NO IDEA YOU WERE HOSTIN,

152
00:11:25,408 --> 00:11:29,130
BUT WE'RE HUGE FANS.
I MEAN, WE'VE SEEN ALL OF YOUR
SPIDER-MAN MOVIES.

153
00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:31,925
SPIDER-MAN.
SPIDER-MAN 2.

154
00:11:31,925 --> 00:11:34,773
SPIDER-MAN THE NEW ONE.

155
00:11:35,051 --> 00:11:37,353
>> YOU KNOW, I HAVE DONE OTHER
FILMS.

156
00:11:37,353 --> 00:11:39,594
>> OH, YEAH, WE KNOW.
WE KNOW.

157
00:11:39,594 --> 00:11:43,092
WE LOVED YOU IN "FULL METAL
JACKET."

158
00:11:43,092 --> 00:11:45,556
>> I ACTUALLY WASN'T IN THAT
ONE.

159
00:11:45,556 --> 00:11:48,649
MAYBE YOU'RE THINKING OF
PLATOON.

160
00:11:48,649 --> 00:11:50,790
>> NO, NO.

161
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:54,726
>> AND YOU WERE GREAT IN "THE
PASSION OF THE CHRIST."

162
00:11:54,726 --> 00:11:58,761
>> I WASN'T IN THAT ONE, EITHER.
I WAS IN "LAST TEMPTATION OF
CHRIST."

163
00:11:58,761 --> 00:12:02,237
>> OH, WELL, WHAT ABOUT "SPEED 2
CRUISE CONTROL"?

164
00:12:02,237 --> 00:12:06,086
>> THAT WAS YOU IN "SPEED 2,"
RIGHT?

165
00:12:06,541 --> 00:12:08,912
>> THAT WAS ME.

166
00:12:09,278 --> 00:12:13,007
>> WELL, APPLETON IS JUST SO
PROUD OF YOU.

167
00:12:13,007 --> 00:12:16,360
I MEAN, YOU'RE OUT THERE MAKING
MOVIES WITH BIG HOLLYWOOD STARS

168
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:19,218
LIKE TIMOTHY CHALAMET AND SHREK.

169
00:12:19,218 --> 00:12:23,322
>> WE JUST WISH YOU STILL HAD
YOUR WISCONSIN ACCENT.

170
00:12:23,322 --> 00:12:26,374
>> WELL, I CAN STILL SPEAK
WISCONSIN.

171
00:12:26,374 --> 00:12:28,194

172
00:12:28,194 --> 00:12:31,866

173
00:12:31,866 --> 00:12:35,903
IF YOU DID

174
00:12:35,903 --> 00:12:37,310
>> OKAY, SURE.

175
00:12:37,310 --> 00:12:43,682
HEY, YOU GUYS, LET'S GO DOWN TO
CRAMBOS AND GET A DRINK FROM THE
BUBBLER.

176
00:12:43,682 --> 00:12:47,640
>> OH, YOU STILL GOT IT!
>> YEAH!

177
00:12:50,005 --> 00:12:54,783
HAS ANYONE TOLD YOU YOU SHOULD
PLAY THE JOKER?

178
00:12:54,783 --> 00:12:57,987
>> WE GOT A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU

179
00:12:59,588 --> 00:13:02,562

187
00:13:31,911 --> 00:13:36,950
SHAME ON YOU!

188
00:13:31,911 --> 00:13:36,950

>> WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?

197
00:13:48,361 --> 00:13:52,098

00:13:48,361 --> 00:13:52,098
$12 THIS MONTH!

199
00:13:52,098 --> 00:13:57,904
>> WELL, WE HAD TO FIX A LEAK IN

200
00:13:52,098 --> 00:13:57,904
THE ROOF.

201
00:13:52,098 --> 00:13:57,904
>> WELL, THIS JUST IN, I DON'T

202

00:14:02,676 --> 00:14:05,879
NEXT, MISS QUINCY FROM 2F.

207
00:14:02,676 --> 00:14:05,879
>> HELLO.

208
00:14:05,879 --> 00:14:12,185
I WOULD LIKE TO FORMALLY ASK THE

209
00:14:05,879 --> 00:14:12,185
BOARD PERMISSION'S TO KILL MY

210
00:14:05,879 --> 00:14:12,185
NEIGHBOR'S LOUD, STUPID, YAPPY

211
00:14:12,185 --> 00:14:15,922
DOG.

212
00:14:12,185 --> 00:14:15,922
>> OBVIOUSLY, PERMISSION IS

213
00:14:12,185 --> 00:14:15,922
DENIED.

214
00:14:15,922 --> 00:14:27,067
>> BITCH, DON'T NEED IT.

215
00:14:15,922 --> 00:14:27,067
I WAS ASKING AS A COURTESY.

216
00:14:15,922 --> 00:14:27,067
>> MISS QUINCY, NO.

217
00:14:27,067 --> 00:14:29,669
MISS WILSON?

218
00:14:27,067 --> 00:14:29,669
>> I AM LIVID RIGHT NOW.

219
00:14:27,067 --> 00:14:29,669
THE LAUNDRY MACHINES IN THIS

220
00:14:29,669 --> 00:14:33,406
BUILDING ARE A DISGRACE.

221
00:14:29,669 --> 00:14:33,406
I WASH MY 13-YEAR-OLD SON'S

222
00:14:29,669 --> 00:14:33,406
SOCKS EVERY WEEK.

223
00:14:33,406 --> 00:14:37,610
BUT A DAY LATER, TADA, THEY TURN

224
00:14:33,406 --> 00:14:37,610
HARD AS A ROCK.

225
00:14:33,406 --> 00:14:37,610
HEAR THAT?

226
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:43,950
HEAR THAT?

227
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:43,950
I WILL GO TO THE NEWS WITH THIS

228
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:43,950
IF THE MACHINES ARE NOT FIXED.

229
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:47,620
THANK YOU AND GOOD-BYE.

230
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:47,620
>> YIKES.

231
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:47,620
OKAY, LOOKS LIKE OUR DOORMAN,

232
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:53,426
JaMARCUS, WANTS TO SAY

233
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:53,426
SOMETHING.

234
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:53,426
>> HEY, FOLKS, HEY.

235
00:14:53,426 --> 00:14:59,799
THIS IS FOR ALL OF THE WHITE

236
00:14:53,426 --> 00:14:59,799
TENANTS.

237
00:14:53,426 --> 00:14:59,799
NOT ALL OF YOU BUT A LOT OF YOU.

238
00:14:59,799 --> 00:15:02,502
I'M NOT SURE HOW IT STARTED,

239
00:14:59,799 --> 00:15:02,502
BUT MANY OF YOU BELIEVE MY NAME

240
00:14:59,799 --> 00:15:02,502
IS JaMARCUS, IT IS NOT.

241
00:15:02,502 --> 00:15:06,373
MY NAME IS ROBERT.

242
00:15:02,502 --> 00:15:06,373
I LET IT SLIDE AT FIRST, BUT

243
00:15:02,502 --> 00:15:06,373
IT SEEMS TO BE CATCHING ON AND I

244
00:15:06,373 --> 00:15:11,378
WANT TO NIP IT IN THE BUD.

245
00:15:06,373 --> 00:15:11,378
>> THANK YOU.

246
00:15:06,373 --> 00:15:11,378

I'M JED FILLMOORE.

270
00:15:51,785 --> 00:15:55,455
I BOUGHT THE TOP THREE FLOORS OF

271
00:15:55,455 --> 00:16:01,327
THIS BUILDING IN 1971 FOR $11

272
00:15:55,455 --> 00:16:01,327
AND IT'S BEEN A PAIN IN THE ASS

273
00:15:55,455 --> 00:16:01,327
EVER SINCE.

274
00:16:01,327 --> 00:16:10,570
MY QUESTION IS, WHAT THE HELL

275
00:16:01,327 --> 00:16:10,570
HAPPENED TO THIS CITY?

276
00:16:01,327 --> 00:16:10,570
WHERE'S THE DANGER, MAN?

277
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:12,672
WHERE'S THE ART?

278
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:12,672
BACK IN MY DAY, IT WAS ALL PIMPS

279
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:12,672
AND WHORES, JUNKIES AND PERVERTS

280
00:16:12,672 --> 00:16:18,044
ALL OVER TIMES SQUARE, MAN.

281
00:16:12,672 --> 00:16:18,044
IT WAS GREAT.

282
00:16:12,672 --> 00:16:18,044

283

285
00:16:18,044 --> 00:16:24,818
WHERE DID THAT CITY GO, MAN?

286
00:16:24,818 --> 00:16:32,559
>> NO IDEA.

287
00:16:24,818 --> 00:16:32,559

288
00:16:24,818 --> 00:16:32,559
>> I DON'T HAVE ONE.

289
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:37,397

290
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:37,397
THE ASS.

291
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:37,397

00:24:08,281 --> 00:24:09,916
BEEP.

477
00:24:09,916 --> 00:24:18,324
AND IF SHE HEARS IT, SHE WILL

478
00:24:09,916 --> 00:24:18,324
TRY AND CLIMB UP TO YOUR HAIR.

479
00:24:09,916 --> 00:24:18,324
FOR HER, THE FOURTH OF JULY IS A

480
00:24:18,324 --> 00:24:30,503
WAR, AND THE ONLY SAFE SPACE IS

481
00:24:18,324 --> 00:24:30,503
BEHIND THE TOILET.

482
00:24:18,324 --> 00:24:30,503
>> LUNA IS ALSO SCARED OF

483
00:24:30,503 --> 00:24:37,544
PLASTIC BAGS, MEN IN HATS,

484
00:24:30,503 --> 00:24:37,544
PINEAPPLES, BALLOONS,

485
00:24:30,503 --> 00:24:37,544
THE NETFLIX START-UP SOUND,

486
00:24:37,544 --> 00:24:44,951
HER OWNERS BEING IN TWO SEPARATE

487
00:24:37,544 --> 00:24:44,951
ROOMS, AND -- THIS IS

488
00:24:37,544 --> 00:24:44,951
EMBARRASSING -- THE SOUND OF

489
00:24:44,951 --> 00:24:53,793
SPOKEN SPANISH.

490
00:24:44,951 --> 00:24:53,793
>> SHE ALSO HAS WHAT THE VET

491
00:24:44,951 --> 00:24:53,793
CALLS "TANGY VAGAINY."

492
00:24:53,793 --> 00:24:56,496
>> A VET SAID THAT?

493
00:24:53,793 --> 00:24:56,496
>> YEAH, SHE DID.

494
00:24:53,793 --> 00:24:56,496
LET'S GO TO THE JUDGES.

495
00:24:56,496 --> 00:24:59,766
>> TELL US ABOUT LUNA.

496
00:24:56,496 --> 00:24:59,766
>> IF HER FAVORITE BLANKET IS

497
00:24:56,496 --> 00:24:59,766
NOT FLUFFED CORRECTLY, SHE WILL

498
00:24:59,766 --> 00:25:11,111
CRY REAL TEARS UNTIL I FIX IT.

499
00:24:59,766 --> 00:25:11,111
IF MY BOYFRIEND COMES HOME AND

500
00:24:59,766 --> 00:25:11,111
NEAR SITTING ME ON THE COUCH,

501
00:25:11,111 --> 00:25:13,079
SHE WILL SCREAM UNTIL HE LEAVES.

502
00:25:11,111 --> 00:25:13,079
MY LIFE IS HELL AND I MISS MY

503
00:25:11,111 --> 00:25:13,079
FRIENDS.

504
00:25:13,079 --> 00:25:15,715
>> THAT'S GOOD.

505
00:25:13,079 --> 00:25:15,715
>> YEAH, TAKE HER ROUND?

506
00:25:13,079 --> 00:25:15,715
>> UH-HUH.

507
00:25:15,715 --> 00:25:20,186
>> NO, NO.

508
00:25:15,715 --> 00:25:20,186
>> DON'T CLAP.

509
00:25:15,715 --> 00:25:20,186
>> IF THESE DOGS HEAR ANY SOUND,

510
00:25:20,186 --> 00:25:26,359
THEY WILL KILL.

511
00:25:20,186 --> 00:25:26,359
>> PLEASE DO NOT CLAP.

512
00:25:20,186 --> 00:25:26,359
>> A REMINDER FROM THE JUDGES

513
00:25:26,359 --> 00:25:32,065
NOT TO CLAP.

514
00:25:26,359 --> 00:25:32,065
>> NEXT FROM THE MEAN GROUP,

515
00:25:26,359 --> 00:25:32,065
IT'S PIGEON.

516
00:25:32,065 --> 00:25:36,269
>> PIGEON IS A SEXUAL PREDATOR

517
00:25:32,065 --> 00:25:36,269
WHO HAS BEEN BANNED FROM EVERY

518
00:25:32,065 --> 00:25:36,269
DOG PARK IN THE STATE OF

519
00:25:36,269 --> 00:25:41,074
MARYLAND.

520
00:25:36,269 --> 00:25:41,074
>> THE VET CALLED HIM "NOT

521
00:25:36,269 --> 00:25:41,074
WELCOME HERE" AND THE GROOMER

522
00:25:41,074 --> 00:25:50,517
CALLED HIM "MANIPULATIVE."

523
00:25:41,074 --> 00:25:50,517
>> PIGEON ONCE TRIPPED AN OLD

524
00:25:41,074 --> 00:25:50,517
LADY ON PURPOSE.

525
00:25:50,517 --> 00:25:54,387
>> HIS OWNER SAID, QUOTE, IT

526
00:25:50,517 --> 00:25:54,387
LOOKED LIKE AN ACCIDENT BUT I

527
00:25:50,517 --> 00:25:54,387
SWEAR TO GOD, I SAW HIM LAUGH.

528
00:25:54,387 --> 00:26:03,063
LET'S CHECK IN WITH THE JUDGES.

529
00:25:54,387 --> 00:26:03,063
>> WELL, WHAT IS PIGEON'S DAILY

530
00:25:54,387 --> 00:26:03,063
ROUTINE?

531
00:26:03,063 --> 00:26:06,266
>> HE WAKES ME UP AT 5:00 A.M.

532
00:26:03,063 --> 00:26:06,266
BY BITING MY FEET.

533
00:26:03,063 --> 00:26:06,266
THEN, HE GOES IN THE HAMPER,

534
00:26:06,266 --> 00:26:08,902
GRABS MY GIRLFRIEND'S UNDERWEAR,

535
00:26:06,266 --> 00:26:08,902
DRAGS IT UNDER THE DINING ROOM

536
00:26:06,266 --> 00:26:08,902
TABLE AND BARKS AGGRESSIVELY.

537
00:26:08,902 --> 00:26:14,174
>> I SEE.

538
00:26:08,902 --> 00:26:14,174
AND WHY DID YOU CHOOSE THIS

539
00:26:08,902 --> 00:26:14,174
MONSTER?

540
00:26:14,174 --> 00:26:17,844
>> OH, WELL, WHEN WE FIRST GOT

541
00:26:14,174 --> 00:26:17,844
HIM, HE WAS SO QUIET.

542
00:26:14,174 --> 00:26:17,844
TURNS OUT HE WAS JUST

543
00:26:17,844 --> 00:26:23,783
TRAUMATIZED.

544
00:26:17,844 --> 00:26:23,783
THIS IS BAD TO SAY, BUT I MISS

545
00:26:17,844 --> 00:26:23,783
THAT VERSION OF HIM.

546
00:26:23,783 --> 00:26:27,287
>> THANK YOU.

547
00:26:23,783 --> 00:26:27,287
>> WOW.

548
00:26:23,783 --> 00:26:27,287
NOW, JUDAS, IT SAYS HERE THAT

549
00:26:27,287 --> 00:26:31,624
YOU AND I ARE MARRIED.

550
00:26:27,287 --> 00:26:31,624
ISN'T THAT RIGHT?

551
00:26:27,287 --> 00:26:31,624
>> THAT IS RIGHT.

552
00:26:31,624 --> 00:26:39,232
AND NOW WE DO THIS.

553
00:26:31,624 --> 00:26:39,232
>> YES!

554
00:26:31,624 --> 00:26:39,232
WELL, FROM THE NONWALKING GROUP,

555
00:26:39,232 --> 00:26:43,803
IT'S BLUEBERRY.

556
00:26:39,232 --> 00:26:43,803
>> SORRY.

557
00:26:39,232 --> 00:26:43,803
BLUEBERRY, COME ON.

558
00:26:43,803 --> 00:26:47,540
BLUEBERRY, PLEASE.

559
00:26:43,803 --> 00:26:47,540
BLUEBERRY, I'M NOT PICKING YOU

560
00:26:43,803 --> 00:26:47,540
UP.

561
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:52,812
BLUEBERRY, WE FLEW HERE.

562
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:52,812
BLUEBERRY, YOU GROUNDED A

563
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:52,812
FLIGHT.

564
00:26:52,812 --> 00:27:00,020
>> BLUEBERRY ONCE SLID ON A TILE

565
00:26:52,812 --> 00:27:00,020
FLOOR, AND IT PERMANENTLY MADE

566
00:26:52,812 --> 00:27:00,020
HIM INSANE.

567
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:05,291
>> YES.

568
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:05,291
HE WILL ONLY POOP IN THE MIDDLE

569
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:05,291
OF THE STREET AND HE IS

570
00:27:05,291 --> 00:27:08,061
MEDICALLY UNABLE TO BE IN A CAR.

571
00:27:05,291 --> 00:27:08,061
>> AND TO BE CLEAR, BLUEBERRY

572
00:27:05,291 --> 00:27:08,061
CAN WALK, HE JUST CHOOSES NOT

573
00:27:08,061 --> 00:27:13,667
TO.

574
00:27:08,061 --> 00:27:13,667
>> AMAZING.

575
00:27:08,061 --> 00:27:13,667
TRULY POINTLESS.

576
00:27:13,667 --> 00:27:22,142
>> AND LASTLY, FROM THE MEDICAL

577
00:27:13,667 --> 00:27:22,142
GROUP, IT'S GIZMO.

578
00:27:13,667 --> 00:27:22,142
>> NOW, GIZMO HAS BAD FEET, BAD

579
00:27:22,142 --> 00:27:25,845
SKIN, BAD TEETH, BAD ANAL

580
00:27:22,142 --> 00:27:25,845
GLANDS, AND A BAD BRAIN.

581
00:27:22,142 --> 00:27:25,845
THE TOTAL PACKAGE.

582
00:27:25,845 --> 00:27:32,352
>> HE'S ALLERGIC TO ANYTHING

583
00:27:25,845 --> 00:27:32,352
THAT IS OR ISN'T DUCK.

584
00:27:25,845 --> 00:27:32,352
JUDGES SQUINTING AT SOMETHING ON

585
00:27:32,352 --> 00:27:40,060
HIS TUMMY.

586
00:27:32,352 --> 00:27:40,060
>> CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT HIS

587
00:27:32,352 --> 00:27:40,060
WEIRD LITTLE PENIS?

588
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:43,697
>> YES.

589
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:43,697
HIS WEIRD LITTLE DOG PENIS IS

590
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:43,697
TOO BIG FOR HIS FRAME, SO WHEN

591
00:27:43,697 --> 00:27:47,400
HE BENDS DOWN A CERTAIN WAY, IT

592
00:27:43,697 --> 00:27:47,400
GETS STUCK OUTSIDE HIS BODY FOR

593
00:27:43,697 --> 00:27:47,400
HOURS AND IT DRIES OUT SO IT

594
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:50,570
WON'T GO BACK IN.

595
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:50,570
AND IT HAS TO BE LUBRICATED AND

596
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:50,570
REINSERTED BY A VETERINARIAN

597
00:27:50,570 --> 00:27:55,308
SEVERAL TIMES A WEEK.

598
00:27:50,570 --> 00:27:55,308
I HATE SAYING THAT, AND I SAY IT

599
00:27:50,570 --> 00:27:55,308
A LOT.

600
00:27:55,308 --> 00:28:01,147
>> THANK YOU.

601
00:27:55,308 --> 00:28:01,147

602
00:27:55,308 --> 00:28:01,147

>> THAT'S ME.

629
00:28:45,058 --> 00:28:48,161
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

630
00:28:48,161 --> 00:28:52,365
>> I'M MARK.

631
00:28:48,161 --> 00:28:52,365
I'M A HUGE FAN.

632
00:28:48,161 --> 00:28:52,365

634
00:28:52,365 --> 00:28:56,569
YOU, BUT YOU LOOK GREAT.

635
00:28:52,365 --> 00:28:56,569
>> AT MY AGE, I TRY TO STAY IN

636
00:28:56,569 --> 00:29:01,841
THE GYM AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE.

637

CAN'T GET HARD ANYMORE?

644
00:29:05,045 --> 00:29:08,748

00:34:49,582 --> 00:34:52,892
>> WELCOME TO "WEEKEND UPDATE."

811
00:34:52,892 --> 00:35:00,166
I'M MICHAEL CHE.

812
00:34:52,892 --> 00:35:00,166
>> I'M COLIN JOST.

813
00:34:52,892 --> 00:35:00,166
>>> WELL, THE STOCK MARKET

814
00:35:00,166 --> 00:35:05,739
IS PLUMMETING AND IT LOOKS LIKE

815
00:35:00,166 --> 00:35:05,739
THERE'S A THREAT OF LAND WAR IN

816
00:35:00,166 --> 00:35:05,739
EUROPE, SO IT LOOKS LIKE

817
00:35:05,739 --> 00:35:12,312
DEMOCRATS WERE RIGHT --

818
00:35:05,739 --> 00:35:12,312
JOE BIDEN IS THE NEXT FDR.

819
00:35:05,739 --> 00:35:12,312
PRESIDENT BIDEN IS WORKING TO

820
00:35:12,312 --> 00:35:16,316
PREVENT A WAR BETWEEN RUSSIA AND

821
00:35:12,312 --> 00:35:16,316
UKRAINE, AND HE SAID A VIDEO

822
00:35:12,312 --> 00:35:16,316
CALL BETWEEN EUROPEAN ALLIES

823
00:35:16,316 --> 00:35:20,053
WENT, "VERY, VERY, VERY WELL."

824
00:35:16,316 --> 00:35:20,053
YEAH, IT'S THE THIRD "VERY" THAT

825
00:35:16,316 --> 00:35:20,053
WORRIES ME.

826
00:35:20,053 --> 00:35:23,189
YOU ONLY SAY THAT WHEN YOU'RE

827
00:35:20,053 --> 00:35:23,189
TRYING TO COVER FOR SOMETHING

828
00:35:20,053 --> 00:35:23,189
THAT'S GOING REALLY BADLY.

829
00:35:23,189 --> 00:35:28,194
IT'S LIKE IF MATT GAETZ SAYS

830
00:35:23,189 --> 00:35:28,194
THAT GIRL WAS VERY, VERY, VERY

831
00:35:23,189 --> 00:35:28,194
OVER 18.

832
00:35:28,194 --> 00:35:32,365
UKRAINIAN OFFICIALS ARE SAYING

833
00:35:28,194 --> 00:35:32,365
THE REPEATED WARNINGS OF

834
00:35:28,194 --> 00:35:32,365
INVASION ARE CAUSE FOR PANIC AND

835
00:35:32,365 --> 00:35:44,344
PANIC IS THE SISTER OF FAILURE,

836
00:35:32,365 --> 00:35:44,344
WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT LORNE SAID

837
00:35:32,365 --> 00:35:44,344
TO GET US TO DO THIS SHOW DURING

838
00:35:44,344 --> 00:35:51,084
A BLIZZARD.

839
00:35:44,344 --> 00:35:51,084
AM I WRONG?

840
00:35:44,344 --> 00:35:51,084
I THOUGHT I VAN KA WAS THE

841
00:35:51,084 --> 00:35:54,220
SISTER OF FAILURE.

842
00:35:51,084 --> 00:35:54,220
>>> SUPREME COURT JUSTICE

843
00:35:51,084 --> 00:35:54,220
STEPHEN BREYER ANNOUNCED THAT HE

844
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:58,992
WILL RETIRE IN JUNE.

845
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:58,992
WE THANK JUSTICE BREYER FOR

846
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:58,992

850
00:36:01,194 --> 00:36:04,297
I SYMPATHIZE WITH BREYER BECAUSE

851
00:36:01,194 --> 00:36:04,297

TO THE SUPREME COURT.

856
00:36:10,103 --> 00:36:20,647
BUT I HOPE IT'S NOT BECAUSE

857
00:36:10,103 --> 00:36:20,647
HE WANTS TO SNIFF A NEW TYPE OF

858
00:36:10,103 --> 00:36:20,647
HAIR.

RADICAL LEFT.

865

COINCIDENTALLY, A RADICAL LEFT

866
00:36:33,927 --> 00:36:36,463
IS ALSO WHAT McDONNELL TAKES TO

867

PURPOSELY RUN OVER STRAY DOGS.

TEACHING CRITICAL RACE THEORY.

REPUBLICANS FEEL THE BRIDGE

885
00:37:05,558 --> 00:37:09,362
SHOULD JUST LIFT ITSELF UP BY

886
00:37:09,362 --> 00:37:13,199
ITS BOOTSTRAPS.

HEAR THE RUMORS THAT TOM BRADY

SPECULATION.

WOULD RETIRE, TOO,

IF IT GAVE ME
MORE TIME TO WATCH "EMILY IN

1097
00:45:12,163 --> 00:45:16,141
THIS IS A CLASSIC SHOWDOWN
BETWEEN EMILY'S CAREER AND HER
LOVE LIFE.

1098
00:45:16,141 --> 00:45:20,328
EARLY ON, THE Os WERE GETTING
COMPLETELY DOMINATED BY THE Xs,

1099
00:45:20,328 --> 00:45:23,916
AND THERE WERE LOTS OF Xs, IF
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

TIMOTHY, DOUG FROM CHICAGO,
OBVIOUSLY.

1102
00:45:30,379 --> 00:45:34,255

RELATIONSHIP WITH GABRIEL,

1103
00:45:34,255 --> 00:45:35,973
AND
TO GET AHEAD AT WORK.

1104
00:45:35,973 --> 00:45:39,959
BUT AS LONG AS CAMILLE IS
BLOCKING HER, SHE'S GOT TO GO
THROUGH HER PROGRESSIONS

1105
00:45:39,959 --> 00:45:42,087
AND
CHECK DOWN TO ALFIE IN THE
FLATS.

1106
00:45:42,087 --> 00:45:45,920
SURE, IT FEELS LIKE A BROKEN
PLAY, AND SHE'S DUMPING IT OFF,

1107
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:49,129
BUT EMOTIONALLY, SHE'S MAKING
FORWARD PROGRESS.

1108
00:45:49,129 --> 00:45:51,461
>> I GOT TO ASK, PEYTON, HOW
MUCH TIME DO YOU SPEND ON THIS?

1109
00:45:51,461 --> 00:45:53,969
>> AND DON'T GET ME STARTED ON
THE COACHING, OKAY?

1110
00:45:53,969 --> 00:45:58,210
HER FRIEND MINDY SERIOUSLY TOLD
EMILY TO BREAK HER PINKY PROMISE

1111
00:45:58,210 --> 00:46:01,231
TO FORGET ABOUT GABRIEL AND STAY
TRUE TO ALFIE?

1112
00:46:01,231 --> 00:46:03,518
SACRE BLEU, MAN.

1113
00:46:04,507 --> 00:46:09,289
IT'S ALMOST HALFTIME OF SEASON
TWO.
YOU'VE GOT TO CALL A TIME-OUT
THERE.

1114
00:46:09,289 --> 00:46:13,005
OOH-LA-LA?
MORE LIKE, OH, NO YOU DIDN'T,
GIRL.

1115
00:46:15,231 --> 00:46:18,020
>> I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT.
I'M NOT SURE.

1116
00:46:18,020 --> 00:46:22,193
>> BUT YOU KNOW WHAT'S NOT
SITTING ON THE SIDELINES?
THE FASHION.

1117
00:46:22,276 --> 00:46:25,704
STRIPED PARACHUTE PANTS,
PLAID NEWSBOY HATS,

1118
00:46:25,704 --> 00:46:28,833
FUR-TRIMMED
CARDIGAN, AND FINGERLESS DRIVING
GLOVES?

1119
00:46:28,833 --> 00:46:31,017
SHE MIGHT NOT BE DRIVING A CAR,

1120
00:46:31,017 --> 00:46:35,117
BUT SHE SURE KNOWS HOW TO DRIVE
AN EPISODE DOWN THE FIELD WITH
THESE LEWKS.

1121
00:46:35,117 --> 00:46:40,245
BY THE WAY, THAT'S LOOKS BUT
IT'S SPELLED L-E-W-K.

1122
00:46:40,555 --> 00:46:43,125
>> THANKS, MAN.
YEAH, I GOT IT.

1123
00:46:43,125 --> 00:46:48,140
HONESTLY I JUST CANNOT BELIEVE
THAT YOU JUST SPENT TEN
STRAIGHT HOURS WATCHING
EMILY IN PARIS.

1124
00:46:48,140 --> 00:46:52,244
YOU COULD HAVE SEEN JOSH ALLEN,
PATRICK MAHOMES, ONE OF THE BEST
QUARTERBACK DUELS IN HISTORY.

1125
00:46:52,335 --> 00:46:58,013
>> SURE, WATCHING FOOTBALL WAS
THE SAFE THING TO DO.

1126
00:46:58,013 --> 00:47:00,073
THAT'S WHAT EVERYONE EXPECTED ME
TO DO.

1127
00:47:00,073 --> 00:47:02,475
BUT IF I'VE LEARNED ANYTHING
FROM EMILY,

1128
00:47:02,475 --> 00:47:06,623
IT'S TO FOLLOW MY
PASSIONS AND ALWAYS BE TRUE TO
MYSELF.

1129
00:47:06,623 --> 00:47:09,766
THE FRENCH HAVE A SAYING --
PARLEZ-VOUS FRANCAIS?

1130
00:47:09,766 --> 00:47:12,863
WHICH MEANS, "YOU DO YOU, GIRL."

1131
00:47:13,339 --> 00:47:15,698
NO.

1132

00:47:53,387 --> 00:47:56,885
>> BELLE, ARE YOU HAPPY HERE
WITH ME?

1141
00:47:56,885 --> 00:47:59,710
>> I'M -- GETTING USED TO IT.

1142
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:05,310

00:48:11,553 --> 00:48:15,131
>> ANYTHING?
>> YES, BELLE, ANYTHING.

1146
00:48:15,342 --> 00:48:18,747

1147
00:48:21,422 --> 00:48:25,408
>> BON SOIR.
IS ANYBODY HOME?

1148
00:48:25,408 --> 00:48:30,027

I KNEW MY FATHER MISSED ME.

1150
00:48:33,263 --> 00:48:36,813
>> OF COURSE HE MISSES YOU,
BELLE.
HE WOULD BE A FOOL IF HE DIDN'T.

1151
00:48:36,813 --> 00:48:41,426

I AM DEFINITELY ALONE THEN.

1153
00:48:45,848 --> 00:48:51,859
NOBODY HERE IN THE COTTAGE,
EXCEPT LITTLE, OLD ME.

1154
00:48:51,859 --> 00:48:55,160
CRAZY OLD MAURICE.

1155
00:48:55,160 --> 00:48:57,512
>> UH-OH.
>> WHAT?

1156
00:48:57,512 --> 00:49:01,244
>> WELL, IT SEEMS LIKE YOUR
FATHER REALLY WANTS TO MAKE SURE
HE'S ALONE.

1157
00:49:01,350 --> 00:49:04,898
>> WELL, HE'S NEVER BEEN BY
HIMSELF BEFORE.
HE'S PROBABLY FRIGHTENED.

1158
00:49:04,898 --> 00:49:07,735

* THIS IS THE BEST DAY OF MY
LIFE *

1160
00:49:15,974 --> 00:49:18,352

1161
00:49:18,352 --> 00:49:22,233
>> WELL, MAYBE HE IS COLD.

1163
00:49:24,298 --> 00:49:33,617
>> DON'T LOOK AT ME.

1164
00:49:33,617 --> 00:49:36,752
LOOK AT ME.

1165
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:40,600
>> HE JUST SEEMS TO BE SO LOST
WITHOUT ME.

1166
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:44,777
>> BELLE, THIS GUY'S NOT
THINKING ABOUT YOU AT ALL, AND
IF HE IS, WE'VE GOT BIGGER
PROBLEMS.

1167
00:49:44,777 --> 00:49:48,360
>> WHAT'S HE DOING NOW?

1168
00:50:00,136 --> 00:50:03,158

00:50:03,158 --> 00:50:06,875
>> I'LL TELL YOU ONE THING --
THE MIRROR NEVER DISAPPOINTS.

1170
00:50:06,875 --> 00:50:09,506
>> OKAY, MAYBE HE SHOULD DO
SOMETHING ELSE.

1171
00:50:09,506 --> 00:50:13,739
ANYBODY WANT TO SING "BE OUR
GUEST" AGAIN?
IT'S A REALLY FUN, COOL SONG.

1172
00:50:13,739 --> 00:50:16,953
>> MAYBE LATER.

1173

SEEN ENOUGH.
ANYONE ELSE WANT TO LOOK IN THE
MIRROR.

1176
00:50:35,567 --> 00:50:39,832
>> QUIET, THE STRANGEST THING OF
ALL IS HAPPENING.

1177
00:50:39,832 --> 00:50:45,552
>> OH, MY LADY, LOOK AT HOW I'M
CARRYING ON SINCE YOUR PASSING.

1178
00:50:45,552 --> 00:50:49,314
I JUST WISH YOU WERE HOLDING ME CLOSE

1179
00:50:49,314 --> 00:50:53,107
AND KISSING MY NECK,
STROKING MY HAIR,

BUT FIRST, OUR MAN ABOUT TOWN, SCOTT COTT,

1380
00:58:42,779 --> 00:58:45,896
IS WITH A LOCAL
AUTHOR WHO'S WRITTEN A NEW
SELF-HELP BOOK

1381
00:58:45,896 --> 00:58:48,462
ABOUT FINDING
HAPPINESS THROUGH
SELF-DISCOVERY.

1382
00:58:48,462 --> 00:58:50,538
HMM, SOUNDS INTERESTING.
>> YEAH, SURE DOES.

1383
00:58:50,538 --> 00:58:53,131
SCOTT'S DOWN AT A BOOK SIGNING
AT BERGMAN'S BOOKS

1384
00:58:53,131 --> 00:58:58,142
WITH
DR. BENJAMIN BLOOM, AUTHOR OF
BLOWING YOURSELF.

1385
00:58:58,142 --> 00:58:59,167
SCOTT?

1386
00:58:59,167 --> 00:59:02,915
>> THANKS, LANGDON.
I AM STANDING NEXT TO A MAN

1387
00:59:02,940 --> 00:59:07,947
WHO
HOPES TO HELP MILLIONS OF FOLKS
FIND HAPPINESS THROUGH
SELF-EXPLORATION.

1388
00:59:07,947 --> 00:59:09,892
>> SCOTT, I HAVE TO JUMP IN.

1389
00:59:09,892 --> 00:59:13,947
I MISSPOKE BEFORE, DR. BLOOM'S
BOOK IS TITLED

1390
00:59:13,947 --> 00:59:19,106
"KNOWING
YOURSELF," NOT "BLOWING
YOURSELF."

1391
00:59:19,106 --> 00:59:22,426
THERE WERE A LOT OF "B" WORDS IN
A ROW ON THE TELEPROMPTER AND I
GOT A LITTLE TONGUE-TIED.

1392
00:59:22,426 --> 00:59:24,931
SORRY ABOUT THAT, SCOTT.
>> IT HAPPENS.

1393
00:59:24,931 --> 00:59:27,910
NOW DR. BLOOM, TELL US ABOUT
YOUR BOOK.

1394
00:59:27,910 --> 00:59:32,626
>> WELL, IT'S A FEEL-GOOD BOOK.
IT'S ABOUT LEARNING HOW TO LOVE YOURSELF

1395
00:59:32,626 --> 00:59:38,079
BY GOING DOWN DEEP AND
EMBRACING THE PART OF YOU THAT
YOU DISCOVER DOWN THERE.

1396
00:59:38,079 --> 00:59:40,524
>> WOW.
THAT'S A LOT TO SWALLOW.

1397
00:59:40,524 --> 00:59:44,107
>> SORRY.
SORRY, SCOTT.
I HAVE TO JUMP IN HERE.

1398
00:59:44,107 --> 00:59:48,753
WE'RE HAVING AN ISSUE WITH OUR
GRAPHICS THAT'S MAKING THIS
INTERVIEW SEEM VERY APPROPRIATE.

1399
00:59:48,753 --> 00:59:52,188
THE BOOK IS "KNOWING YOURSELF."

1400
00:59:52,188 --> 00:59:55,116
>> COME ON, GRAPHICS DEPARTMENT.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
GET IT TOGETHER.

1401
00:59:55,116 --> 00:59:57,657
SCOTT.
>> THANKS, LANGDON.

1402
00:59:57,657 --> 01:00:01,685

YOU.

01:00:01,686 --> 01:00:03,927
OVER

1404
01:00:03,927 --> 01:00:06,279
>> THIS IS CINDY.

1405
01:00:06,279 --> 01:00:10,442
>> DO YOU PRACTICE IS TECHNIQUES
IN YOUR HUSBAND'S BOOK?

1406
01:00:10,442 --> 01:00:14,411
>> YES, IT WAS A LITTLE HARDER
FOR ME TO GET THERE, THOUGH.

1407
01:00:14,411 --> 01:00:19,866
I THINK WOMEN HAVE TO REACH
DEEPER IN THEMSELVES TO FIND
HAPPINESS?

1408
01:00:19,866 --> 01:00:23,767
>> ABSOLUTELY.
WOMEN ARE GENERALLY MORE COMPLEX,

1409
01:00:23,767 --> 01:00:26,501
A LOT MORE NOOKS AND
CRANNIES TO EXPLORE.

1410
01:00:26,501 --> 01:00:30,298
>> IT CAN BE AN EMOTIONALLY
TAXING PROCESS.

1411
01:00:30,298 --> 01:00:34,685
IF YOU'RE LIKE ME, YOUR
SENSITIVE SIDE IS GOING TO TAKE A LICKING,

1412
01:00:34,685 --> 01:00:38,833
BUT IN THE END, TRUST
ME, IT'S SO WORTH IT.

1413
01:00:38,833 --> 01:00:43,100
BUY HIS BOOK.
I HAD MY NOSE BURIED IN IT FOR
HOURS.

1414
01:00:43,100 --> 01:00:45,950
>> I'M SURE YOU DID.
THANK YOU, CINDY.

1415
01:00:45,950 --> 01:00:50,070
>> DOCTOR, YOU'RE GOING TEACH ME
ONE OF YOUR BREATHING EXERCISES
HERE.

1416
01:00:50,070 --> 01:00:53,298
I TRIED YOGA ONCE AND I WAS AWFUL,

1417
01:00:53,298 --> 01:00:55,191
SO HOPEFULLY I DON'T SUCK
HERE.

1418
01:00:55,191 --> 01:00:59,307
>> HEY, IT'S OKAY TO SUCK.
IT'S HOW WE LEARN.

1419
01:00:59,307 --> 01:01:02,606
>> OKAY, GOOD.
WE'VE GOT SOME MATS HERE.

1420
01:01:02,606 --> 01:01:04,455
>> LET'S GET DOWN.
>> GREAT.

1421
01:01:04,455 --> 01:01:07,490
>> YOU CAN DO THIS IN A CHAIR AT
HOME ALSO.
>> OKAY.

1422
01:01:07,490 --> 01:01:11,440
>> OKAY.
YOU WANT TO CENTER YOURSELF LIKE
SO.

1423
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:13,062
>> OKAY. CENTER.

1424
01:01:13,062 --> 01:01:17,759
>> OKAY, BREATHE DEEPLY, REALLY
FILL YOUR MOUTH WITH LOTS --

1425
01:01:17,759 --> 01:01:20,740
>> NO.

1426
01:01:20,740 --> 01:01:25,810
FOLKS, WE ARE SO DEEPLY SORRY.

1427
01:01:25,810 --> 01:01:28,909
THIS LOOKS VERY BAD.

1428
01:01:30,464 --> 01:01:34,182
MAYBE WE GO TO SPORTS?
SPORTS, YEAH?

1429
01:01:34,182 --> 01:01:40,533
WANT TO GIVE PEOPLE YOUR SUPER

1430
01:01:36,129 --> 01:01:37,307
BOWL PREDICTIONS?

1431
01:01:37,499 --> 01:01:40,225
>> NO, LET'S LET THIS PLAY OUT.

1432
01:01:40,225 --> 01:01:42,529
>> THANK YOU FOR NOTHING, NICK.

1433
01:01:42,529 --> 01:01:45,670
LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE WRAPPING UP.
BRING THE AUDIO BACK.

1434
01:01:45,670 --> 01:01:51,311
>> OH.
WOW, I HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO.
I GOT TO GET PRACTICING.

1435
01:01:51,456 --> 01:01:54,490
>> WELL, DON'T GO NUTS WHEN
