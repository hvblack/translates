1
00:00:00,916 --> 00:00:04,794
<i>Cheers is filmed
before a live studio audience.</i>

2
00:00:05,292 --> 00:00:07,100
There you go.

3
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:08,434
Cheers.

4
00:00:08,434 --> 00:00:13,083
Oh, yeah, hi, Vera.
Uh, let me see if he's here yet.

5
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:18,369
Oh, yeah, he just walked in.
Yeah, here he is right now.

6
00:00:18,369 --> 00:00:20,395
All right, bye.

7
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:23,815
Hi, honey.
Yeah.

8
00:00:23,815 --> 00:00:26,916
I, I have no idea.
I mean, uh...

9
00:00:26,916 --> 00:00:30,900
did you try that broom closet?
Well, how about the pantry?

10
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:33,710
Well, that would be
a good place to look, okay?

11
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:36,080
All right.
Okay, let me know, thanks.

12
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:37,829
Oh, here.

13
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:39,749
Well, what's
Mrs. Peterson doing?

14
00:00:39,749 --> 00:00:42,467
I don't know, she's looking
for the fire extinguisher.

15
00:00:44,626 --> 00:00:47,968
Was there a fire in your house?

16
00:00:47,968 --> 00:00:50,772
I have no idea.
Should I have asked?

17
00:00:58,046 --> 00:01:00,766
¶ Making your way
in the world today ¶

18
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,601
¶ Takes everything you've got.

19
00:01:03,635 --> 00:01:06,137
¶ Taking a break

20
00:01:06,172 --> 00:01:09,336
¶ Sure would help a lot.

21
00:01:09,573 --> 00:01:13,611

22
00:01:15,481 --> 00:01:17,749

27

¶ You want to be where everybody

28
00:01:37,751 --> 00:01:40,442
¶ You want to go

29
00:01:40,442 --> 00:01:43,038

¶ You want to go where
everybody knows your name. ¶

31
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:13,337
Attention, everyone, attention!

32
00:02:13,372 --> 00:02:16,275
I'm getting rid
of that television.

33
00:02:17,309 --> 00:02:21,482
And I am replacing it
this weekend
with a new 27-inch screen TV

34
00:02:21,482 --> 00:02:24,505
with a direct hookup
to the Cable Sports Channel.

35
00:02:24,505 --> 00:02:25,864
Thank you.

36
00:02:27,847 --> 00:02:31,327
Kind of a jerky thing to do,
but I liked it.

37
00:02:31,327 --> 00:02:34,275
That means we'll be able
to watch that world welterweight
championship bout

38
00:02:34,309 --> 00:02:35,944
between Hector
"The Hammer" Rodriguez

39
00:02:35,979 --> 00:02:37,412
and Julio
"The Hacker" Rodriguez.

40
00:02:37,447 --> 00:02:40,418
- Who do you think's gonna win?
- My money's on Rodriguez.

41
00:02:40,467 --> 00:02:43,535
Julio "The Hacker" Rodriguez
has got a glass jaw.

42
00:02:43,535 --> 00:02:47,863
My uncle Fergie had a glass eye.
He used to take it out
and scare the cat.

43
00:02:51,877 --> 00:02:54,113
This is Cheers, Dorothy.

44
00:02:54,113 --> 00:02:56,586
Isn't it amusing?

45
00:02:56,582 --> 00:03:00,057
Frasier, would you be a dear
and get us some drinks?

46
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,824
Sam, can I have
three martinis please?

47
00:03:05,824 --> 00:03:06,775
Make mine a double.

48
00:03:06,809 --> 00:03:09,077
How's married life treating ya?
Quite a change, huh?

49
00:03:09,111 --> 00:03:12,761
Well, you know, Lilith and I
did live together for
a year before we wed.

50
00:03:12,761 --> 00:03:16,116
So other than the fact
that I now see it
stretching endlessly before me,

51
00:03:16,116 --> 00:03:19,184
until I lie rotting
in the grave,
there's no real difference.

52
00:03:19,755 --> 00:03:24,605
Now, Lilith, if you,
your family,
and generations of your
ancestors

53
00:03:24,605 --> 00:03:27,579
had lived
with the boot of oppression
on your throat,

54
00:03:27,613 --> 00:03:30,898
would cutting out a man's heart
seem that extreme?

55
00:03:30,933 --> 00:03:34,469
So who's the party girl?

56
00:03:34,503 --> 00:03:36,337
Dorothy Greenberg.

57
00:03:36,337 --> 00:03:39,381
She's an old childhood chum
of Lilith's from New York.

58
00:03:39,381 --> 00:03:41,040
She's been visiting for a week.

59
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,812
She's a professional student.
She's writing her dissertation

60
00:03:43,846 --> 00:03:47,349
on the Comuneros' uprising in
Paraguay during the 1700s.

61
00:03:47,383 --> 00:03:49,484
She can't talk
about anything else.

62
00:03:49,518 --> 00:03:54,700
Believe me, when you've heard
one Bruno de Zavala joke,
you've heard them all.

63
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:01,182
Sam, I got to
get this over with.

64
00:04:01,182 --> 00:04:03,759
Listen, there's something
I got to ask you,

65
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:05,756
and I don't want you
to take it the wrong way.

66
00:04:05,756 --> 00:04:09,272
- What is it?
- Would you come to dinner
at my house tonight?

67
00:04:09,272 --> 00:04:11,589
Hey, I thought we were friends.

68
00:04:11,589 --> 00:04:14,292
Well, it's just that
Eddie wants us
to practice our social skills

69
00:04:14,326 --> 00:04:16,459
so he can invite
his boss over to dinner.

70
00:04:16,459 --> 00:04:18,922
Can't you ask somebody else?
Please?

71
00:04:18,922 --> 00:04:21,542
Come on.
I'm sure any one of the guys
would love to go.

72
00:04:21,542 --> 00:04:23,302
Guys, am I...

73
00:04:25,726 --> 00:04:30,758
- So, uh...
I'll expect you at 7:00?
- Yeah, all right. All right.

74
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:36,880
- Where'd you guys go?
- Go? Huh?

75
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,910
We were right here
all the time, Sammy.

76
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:42,732
By the way, uh,
thanks for hogging
that invitation

77
00:04:42,732 --> 00:04:45,322
to Carla's house
all for yourself.

78
00:04:45,791 --> 00:04:48,169
There's room for one more.

79
00:04:54,616 --> 00:04:58,603
- Sam, you sit here.
- Thank you.

80
00:04:58,637 --> 00:05:00,321
What is this, Sammy... no date?

81
00:05:00,355 --> 00:05:02,040
Uh, your mom didn't
want me to bring one.

82
00:05:02,074 --> 00:05:04,910
I always like
to be the prettiest woman
in my house.

83
00:05:04,944 --> 00:05:06,978
And you always will be, baby.

84
00:05:07,012 --> 00:05:09,613
You're no magazine cover
yourself.

85
00:05:13,503 --> 00:05:15,054
Now.

86
00:05:24,636 --> 00:05:27,332
Oh, these look great.

87
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:47,824
You know, Carla,
it's, uh, nice to see you

88
00:05:47,824 --> 00:05:50,290
surrounded by
such a loving family.

89
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:52,574
Oh, it's eerie, Sam. Mmm.

90
00:05:52,608 --> 00:05:55,083
I got a husband
who does windows.

91
00:05:55,083 --> 00:05:57,827
And all the kids
are out of jail.

92
00:05:59,582 --> 00:06:02,884
For the first time in my life,
when morning comes around,

93
00:06:02,884 --> 00:06:06,320
I want to open up my eyes
instead of my wrists.

94
00:06:06,355 --> 00:06:08,785
That's beautiful, honey.

95
00:06:10,259 --> 00:06:12,817
Uh, and who knows, Ma?
Someday...

96
00:06:12,817 --> 00:06:14,929
well,
you can look forward
to having grandkids.

97
00:06:14,963 --> 00:06:17,098
Carla, a grandmother?

98
00:06:17,132 --> 00:06:18,733
You've got to be kidding.

99
00:06:18,768 --> 00:06:22,336
No, no.
Sammy, it's true.

100
00:06:22,371 --> 00:06:24,639
I think I'd like to be
a grandmother someday.

101
00:06:24,674 --> 00:06:26,965
I mean, get all the fun,
none of the responsibility.

102
00:06:26,965 --> 00:06:29,377
Just seeing the little brats
when I want to.

103
00:06:29,412 --> 00:06:33,347
I think you're gonna
be surprised
what a sweet
little old granny I'll be.

104
00:06:33,382 --> 00:06:35,800
That's great,
'cause I knocked up Annie good.

105
00:06:35,835 --> 00:06:37,205
What!?

106
00:06:38,621 --> 00:06:40,322
Hey, hey, hey!

107
00:06:40,322 --> 00:06:43,639
Oh! Oh! Carla!
Carla! Carla!

108
00:06:44,493 --> 00:06:46,278
What are you thinking of?!

109
00:06:46,312 --> 00:06:48,852
I just waxed that table.

110
00:06:48,852 --> 00:06:52,506
Come here, come here.
Come on, come on.
Get off. Come on.

111
00:06:59,908 --> 00:07:03,411
And besides...
this is family business.

112
00:07:03,446 --> 00:07:04,816
Let's, um...

113
00:07:05,748 --> 00:07:08,582
Let's talk
about this later, okay?

114
00:07:25,367 --> 00:07:28,551
So what kind of car
do you drive, Ed?

115
00:07:29,838 --> 00:07:32,907
I thought you said
you wanted to be a grandmother.

116
00:07:32,941 --> 00:07:35,376
Someday.
Like years from now,

117
00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:37,712
when you've moved
thousands of miles away.

118
00:07:37,747 --> 00:07:40,071
Carla, please.

119
00:07:43,986 --> 00:07:46,861
I drive a Corvette myself.

120
00:07:47,623 --> 00:07:49,241
How could you do this?!

121
00:07:49,241 --> 00:07:51,893
Hey, I'm going to
be 20 in two years.

122
00:07:51,927 --> 00:07:55,146
I can hear my biological
clock ticking.

123
00:07:55,539 --> 00:07:57,932
Do you know what it
takes to raise a kid?

124
00:07:57,966 --> 00:07:59,801
Ma, will you relax? I got a job.

125
00:07:59,835 --> 00:08:02,589
You think you can
support a family
pushing cheeseburgers?!

126
00:08:02,589 --> 00:08:04,138
Well, I thought
we'd all stay here.

127
00:08:04,172 --> 00:08:07,308
Ho-ho, great.
More people in this house.

128
00:08:07,343 --> 00:08:10,620
I get about 19 on the
highway, 15 in town.

129
00:08:12,577 --> 00:08:15,624
Whose stupid idea
was this anyway?

130
00:08:15,624 --> 00:08:18,420
Hey, I was getting bored
sitting around the house.

131
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:20,510
I thought this might
give her something to do.

132
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:22,911
I'll give you
something to do!

133
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:28,516
- Oh!
- No, no.
Carla, Carla, Carla!
Come on.

134
00:08:29,398 --> 00:08:33,100
Well...
if this is the way
that we are going to be treated

135
00:08:33,135 --> 00:08:35,374
on the happiest day
of our young lives,

136
00:08:35,374 --> 00:08:38,432
then I don't want
to live in this house anymore!

137
00:08:39,891 --> 00:08:43,441
Anthony!
You should probably
come with me.

138
00:08:43,441 --> 00:08:46,130
But we haven't eaten yet.

139
00:08:46,164 --> 00:08:50,956
Your hair is full
of bread crumbs.
We could butter your head
and make a sandwich.

140
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:54,159
I had a sandwich for lunch!

141
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:56,607
Oh, go on. Go, go!
Get out of here!

142
00:08:56,641 --> 00:08:58,533
Let's see how long
you last on your own!

143
00:08:58,533 --> 00:09:01,746
I give you three days!
Two, two tops! You hear me?

144
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:03,618
Carla, come on. Calm down.

145
00:09:05,584 --> 00:09:08,785
Sammy, you get 15 in the city?

146
00:09:10,689 --> 00:09:13,007
Hey, so they're
gonna have a baby.

147
00:09:13,041 --> 00:09:15,181
They'll, they'll find their way
through it.

148
00:09:15,394 --> 00:09:20,387
You don't understand.
My life is over.

149
00:09:20,387 --> 00:09:22,413
I'm going to be a grandmother.

150
00:09:22,413 --> 00:09:26,604
I mean,
I might as well wrap myself up
in a black babushka,

151
00:09:26,638 --> 00:09:29,505
get fat and grow hairs
out of my moles.

152
00:09:29,505 --> 00:09:33,203
Oh, come on.
You're exaggerating.

153
00:09:33,228 --> 00:09:35,917
Do I have
to get out the family album?

154
00:09:35,917 --> 00:09:39,469
Oh, God,
this is terrible.

155
00:09:39,918 --> 00:09:43,713
Look at my life.
I never had a childhood.

156
00:09:43,713 --> 00:09:45,606
I married Nick when I was 15.

157
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:48,293
Never got to go
to the prom or homecoming,

158
00:09:48,327 --> 00:09:52,880
to a slumber party,
to Fort Lauderdale
on Spring Break.

159
00:09:52,914 --> 00:09:55,880
Or on one lousy date
with Fabian.

160
00:09:57,035 --> 00:09:59,187
Now I don't even get
a middle age.

161
00:09:59,221 --> 00:10:02,489
Go straight from grade school
to Granny.

162
00:10:02,524 --> 00:10:04,334
I don't know what to say,
Carla.

163
00:10:04,334 --> 00:10:06,069
Just don't say anything, okay?

164
00:10:06,069 --> 00:10:10,236
There's nothing anybody can say
that's gonna change anything,
so just don't say anything.

165
00:10:10,236 --> 00:10:10,899
Yeah, but, Carla...

166
00:10:10,899 --> 00:10:13,619
Sam, I said don't say anything.
Weren't you listening to me?

167
00:10:13,619 --> 00:10:14,204
Yes, Carla...

168
00:10:14,204 --> 00:10:17,524
I said don't say anything!
Nobody listens to me.

169
00:10:17,524 --> 00:10:20,034
- I listen to...
- Shut up, shut up, shut up!

170
00:10:20,659 --> 00:10:23,894
Just stay away
and leave me alone!

171
00:10:23,928 --> 00:10:28,354
I'm going to my room,
wait for the angel of death.

172
00:10:39,195 --> 00:10:43,091
Oh, here's one
of my favorite paintings
of the Comuneros.

173
00:10:43,091 --> 00:10:48,502
It depicts the peasant army
struggling
to push this cannon
to the top of the hill.

174
00:10:48,537 --> 00:10:51,023
Later, they found out
they were on the wrong hill

175
00:10:51,023 --> 00:10:53,808
and had fired
on their own village.

176
00:10:54,391 --> 00:10:57,894
These people had no luck.

177
00:10:58,297 --> 00:11:01,501
That's fascinating, Dorothy.

178
00:11:01,501 --> 00:11:04,539
Isn't that fascinating, Frasier?

179
00:11:04,971 --> 00:11:06,638
Oh, yes, yes.

180
00:11:06,672 --> 00:11:10,592
You know, these stories make me
long to visit Paraguay...

181
00:11:10,626 --> 00:11:12,418
right now.

182
00:11:19,101 --> 00:11:21,353
I hired you
as a temporary waitress.

183
00:11:21,387 --> 00:11:23,827
What on earth were you doing
with your blouse off?

184
00:11:23,827 --> 00:11:26,821
- Serving drinks.
- This is not a topless bar.

185
00:11:26,821 --> 00:11:28,831
What, I'm supposed to get
tips for good service?

186
00:11:28,831 --> 00:11:31,192
Yes, dear, that's the way
we do it around here.

187
00:11:31,192 --> 00:11:34,389
Well, I'm sorry,
but I don't beauties
like these under wraps.

188
00:11:34,389 --> 00:11:36,984
Out.
Out!

189
00:11:37,019 --> 00:11:41,090
God, that is the fourth temp
waitress we've gone through.

190
00:11:41,090 --> 00:11:42,253
I hate this bar.

191
00:11:42,253 --> 00:11:45,643
- Excuse me, Miss,
can we get some service?
- Yes, sir.

192
00:11:45,677 --> 00:11:48,246
Miss,
this martini is too dry.

193
00:11:48,281 --> 00:11:50,415
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'll take care of that.

194
00:11:50,449 --> 00:11:53,118
I've had it.
Isn't Carla ever coming back?

195
00:11:53,152 --> 00:11:56,219
I was not born to be a waitress.
I was born to manage waitresses.

196
00:11:56,219 --> 00:11:59,762
- Oh, Miss?
- You'll get it when
I'm damn good and ready!

197
00:12:01,293 --> 00:12:02,722
Oh, God.

198
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:05,997
Well, we tried
to cheer up Carla,
but I don't think it worked.

199
00:12:06,032 --> 00:12:08,099
Yeah? How far did you get?

200
00:12:08,133 --> 00:12:12,234
About a half block away.
She hit Mr. Clavin with a rock.

201
00:12:13,972 --> 00:12:16,974
Woody, uh, would you have
a little look-see?
Is there a lump up there?

202
00:12:17,009 --> 00:12:18,542
Well, let's see.

203
00:12:18,577 --> 00:12:20,318
No.

204
00:12:20,318 --> 00:12:23,431
Gee, Mr. Clavin, do you
pluck your eyebrows?

205
00:12:26,515 --> 00:12:29,440
We can't get along
without Carla here.
How can we get her back?

206
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:32,289
Uh, well, I don't know,
but let's start
at square one here.

207
00:12:32,324 --> 00:12:35,193
We know that, uh, she's upset
about having a
grandchild, right?

208
00:12:35,227 --> 00:12:36,694
Another round, Sam?

209
00:12:36,729 --> 00:12:39,358
Coming right up.
Table 11, please.

210
00:12:41,733 --> 00:12:45,569
Well, she was complaining
that she'd missed out on all
that teenage stuff, you know?

211
00:12:45,604 --> 00:12:46,971
Homecoming, proms, may...

212
00:12:47,005 --> 00:12:50,375
What-What if we do something
to take her back
to her teen years?

213
00:12:50,409 --> 00:12:51,459
Like get her pregnant?

214
00:12:51,493 --> 00:12:55,104
No.
That's been done to death.

215
00:12:56,715 --> 00:12:58,992
W-What else did she say?
What else?

216
00:12:58,992 --> 00:13:01,402
Uh, let me think, let me think.
All right, something
about a sleep over.

217
00:13:01,437 --> 00:13:03,228
No, no, I know. Slumber party.
Yeah, slumber party.

218
00:13:03,228 --> 00:13:06,056
A slumber party?
Well, that's it.

219
00:13:06,091 --> 00:13:09,226
Why don't we just
throw the woman
a slumber party, and
that'll cheer her up.

220
00:13:09,261 --> 00:13:11,983
Recreating a ritual
of youth is often
just the thing

221
00:13:11,983 --> 00:13:14,982
to get someone
out of depression centered
on a fear of aging.

222
00:13:15,016 --> 00:13:19,858
I find it also helps
to listen to heavy doses
of Credence Clearwater Revival.

223
00:13:21,089 --> 00:13:23,791
- Great. I'm gonna do that.
- All right.

224
00:13:23,826 --> 00:13:26,800
Just one question.
What-what do you do
at a slumber party?

225
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:30,904
Well, the phrase "slumber party"
would imply that one sleeps,

226
00:13:30,904 --> 00:13:34,416
but somehow I sense
that's meant to be ironic.

227
00:13:35,038 --> 00:13:37,688
Terrific. We're really
on a roll here.

228
00:13:37,723 --> 00:13:39,396
I have a patient of that age.

229
00:13:39,396 --> 00:13:42,593
I suppose
I could do some research
and help you put
something together.

230
00:13:42,593 --> 00:13:44,946
Thank you, Lilith.
I would really appreciate that.
- Certainly.

231
00:13:44,946 --> 00:13:47,712
- Say, Rebecca,
if you're in need
of some extra guests,

232
00:13:47,712 --> 00:13:52,624
I know a couple
of fun-loving gals
who could really use
a night on the town
away from boring old me.

233
00:13:53,195 --> 00:13:57,425
And, uh,
Lilith, you've always told me
that you found Carla
an interesting, uh...

234
00:13:57,459 --> 00:13:59,099
psychological case study.

235
00:13:59,128 --> 00:14:00,395
Won't you be lonely?

236
00:14:00,429 --> 00:14:03,537
Well, it'll give me
a chance to be alone
with Dorothy's books

237
00:14:03,537 --> 00:14:05,895
and a roaring fire.

238
00:14:09,538 --> 00:14:11,681
Well, what do you say, Lilith?

239
00:14:11,681 --> 00:14:14,241
¶ Big wheel keep on turning.

240
00:14:14,276 --> 00:14:16,666
¶ Proud Mary keep on burning.

241
00:14:16,666 --> 00:14:19,885
¶ Rolling ¶ Rolling.
¶ Rolling ¶ Rolling.

242
00:14:19,885 --> 00:14:22,617
¶ Rolling on the river...

243
00:14:22,651 --> 00:14:26,747
You know, you don't often get
to see them loosen up like this.

244
00:14:37,165 --> 00:14:39,103
Come on in, the coast is clear.

245
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:42,136
Hi, Eddie. Hey, how you doing?
Good. Hi, uh... how are you?

246
00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:44,880
There you go. Thank you so much.
Sure, sure.

247
00:14:45,207 --> 00:14:47,998
All right, I'm gonna
put on the 45s.

248
00:14:48,076 --> 00:14:50,584
- Where's Carla?
- She's in the back room knitting.

249
00:14:50,584 --> 00:14:52,607
Oh, that's a sign
she's perking up.

250
00:14:52,607 --> 00:14:55,615
I don't think so.
It's her death shroud.

251
00:14:57,700 --> 00:15:02,023
Oh, no.
I forgot the marshmallows
for the hot chocolate.

252
00:15:02,057 --> 00:15:04,926
That's okay, we'll use
the ones for the s'mores.

253
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:07,328
Then what will we use
for the s'mores?

254
00:15:07,362 --> 00:15:08,963
Why don't we just skip
the s'mores?

255
00:15:08,997 --> 00:15:11,423
You've been trying to get rid of
the s'mores since we've started.

256
00:15:11,423 --> 00:15:14,098
- No, I haven't.
- You most certainly have...

257
00:15:16,838 --> 00:15:18,184
Go get Carla.

258
00:15:18,184 --> 00:15:20,781
Hey, Carla,
could you come out
here for a second?

259
00:15:20,781 --> 00:15:22,243
No!

260
00:15:22,277 --> 00:15:25,502
I'd like to discuss something
about your, uh, grave site.

261
00:15:25,502 --> 00:15:27,343
Be right there.

262
00:15:34,923 --> 00:15:36,148
Now!

263
00:15:36,148 --> 00:15:38,493
Surprise!

264
00:15:38,527 --> 00:15:41,446
What the hell
are you doing here?

265
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:43,872
We're having a slumber party!

266
00:15:43,872 --> 00:15:47,553
That's right, Carla.
Hold on to your hat;
The gals are here.

267
00:15:47,553 --> 00:15:49,236
Eddie, get the gun.

268
00:15:49,271 --> 00:15:51,066
Now, Carla,
we know you're down,

269
00:15:51,066 --> 00:15:53,807
but being alone is no way
to deal with depression.

270
00:15:53,842 --> 00:15:55,909
You need your friends
around you.

271
00:15:55,909 --> 00:15:58,800
Good idea.
Who the hell are you?

272
00:16:00,382 --> 00:16:03,717
Dorothy.
Dorothy Greenberg.

273
00:16:03,751 --> 00:16:05,819
Well, listen, Dorothy, Dorothy,

274
00:16:05,854 --> 00:16:08,890
get the hell out of here,
and take all this crap with you.

275
00:16:08,890 --> 00:16:11,092
Now, come on, Carla.
Come on.

276
00:16:11,126 --> 00:16:13,577
- Why'd you let them in?
- Because for the last four days

277
00:16:13,612 --> 00:16:16,698
you've been sitting around
moping and whining
and scaring the kids.

278
00:16:16,698 --> 00:16:19,249
I mean, for God's sake,
you haven't yelled at them once.

279
00:16:19,284 --> 00:16:22,426
Don't you think children
notice those things?

280
00:16:23,087 --> 00:16:26,357
You're right,
I'm not a fit mother.
I'll leave immediately.

281
00:16:26,391 --> 00:16:29,299
No, no, no.
Come on, Carla, look.

282
00:16:29,299 --> 00:16:32,696
Look, if you're not gonna
do this for yourself,
will you do it for me?

283
00:16:32,731 --> 00:16:35,816
I can't live with you
like this anymore.

284
00:16:35,851 --> 00:16:40,014
Look, sweetie, gi-give
it a chance, would you?
Come on, give it an hour.

285
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:44,241
Look, if I do this,
would you and the Supremes

286
00:16:44,275 --> 00:16:47,845
promise to leave me alone,
get off my back?

287
00:16:47,879 --> 00:16:49,012
We promise.

288
00:16:49,047 --> 00:16:51,677
All right,
let's get the thing over with.

289
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:54,718
Let the slumber party begin.

290
00:16:56,488 --> 00:16:58,946
I'm going to take off
for about an hour,
then I'm gonna come back

291
00:16:58,946 --> 00:17:02,142
and help you clean up
after you have
all your wacky gal fun.

292
00:17:02,177 --> 00:17:04,376
Bring body bags.

293
00:17:08,981 --> 00:17:12,372
Well, Lilith, you have the list.
Where do we start?

294
00:17:13,188 --> 00:17:16,457
All right, let's see.
All right, so on the list

295
00:17:16,491 --> 00:17:19,141
we have to do, uh,
each other's hair.

296
00:17:19,141 --> 00:17:21,628
Then we talk about boys.

297
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:23,815
Ooh, tell scary stories.

298
00:17:23,815 --> 00:17:25,084
Have a pillow fight,

299
00:17:25,084 --> 00:17:28,682
and then for the grand finale,
assorted madcap pranks.

300
00:17:28,682 --> 00:17:31,638
What kind of pranks?

301
00:17:31,673 --> 00:17:35,643
According to my patient,
when the first person
falls asleep,

302
00:17:35,677 --> 00:17:38,680
the others take her underwear,
dip it in water

303
00:17:38,714 --> 00:17:43,050
and then put it
in the icebox for an hour
to freeze it solid.

304
00:17:43,986 --> 00:17:47,208
Or they could let you
wear it for ten minutes.

305
00:17:49,742 --> 00:17:53,828
Why don't we just
move to the pillow fight?

306
00:17:56,798 --> 00:18:00,782
Do that again,
and they'll be
tracing you in chalk.

307
00:18:00,782 --> 00:18:03,153
Uh-oh, Carla.

308
00:18:03,188 --> 00:18:06,752
I saw the corners of
your mouth twitching.

309
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:10,538
Are there little elves
pulling on them?

310
00:18:10,538 --> 00:18:13,914
Up. Up.
Oh, here they go again.

311
00:18:13,949 --> 00:18:15,759
Are you trying not to smile?

312
00:18:15,784 --> 00:18:18,753
No, I'm getting ready
to spit on you.

313
00:18:24,709 --> 00:18:28,362
Yep, in a little under an hour,
Hector "The Hammer" Rodriguez

314
00:18:28,396 --> 00:18:32,566
will be nailing
Julio "The Hasbeen" Rodriguez
into the canvas on our new TV.

315
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:33,987
Cliffie, in your dreams.

316
00:18:33,987 --> 00:18:36,838
- I say "The Hammer"
goes down in five rounds.
- You're on.

317
00:18:36,872 --> 00:18:38,511
I say three. Two.

318
00:18:38,511 --> 00:18:40,006
All right. Get some
money up here.

319
00:18:40,006 --> 00:18:42,509
We don't even have a manual.
How are you gonna
hook that thing up?

320
00:18:42,544 --> 00:18:45,842
Easy, Sam.
They included
a special videotape

321
00:18:45,842 --> 00:18:47,915
showing exactly
how to hook everything up.

322
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:50,840
So all we have to do
is hook everything up,

323
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:54,038
watch the tape,
and then we'll know
exactly what to do.

324
00:18:57,059 --> 00:19:01,111
Okay, how long
before Woody spots the
flaw in his reasoning?

325
00:19:01,111 --> 00:19:03,997
I say, uh, eight minutes.
Give me three.

326
00:19:03,997 --> 00:19:06,181
Okay, I say five. I say two.

327
00:19:07,682 --> 00:19:10,537
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

328
00:19:10,572 --> 00:19:11,874
There you go. I'm in for ten.

329
00:19:11,874 --> 00:19:12,757
Cheers.

330
00:19:12,791 --> 00:19:15,717
Sam, we're over here at Carla's,
but things aren't going
very well.

331
00:19:15,717 --> 00:19:18,486
I thought that maybe
you guys could come over
and crash the party.

332
00:19:18,486 --> 00:19:22,393
You know, something
to shake things up a little bit?
I'm desperate.

333
00:19:22,393 --> 00:19:26,465
Oh, really?
I bet you're kind of sexy
when you're desperate, huh?

334
00:19:27,472 --> 00:19:29,380
- Breathing heavily?
- Sam.

335
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:31,858
- Is your chest heaving?
- Sam, please.

336
00:19:31,893 --> 00:19:35,807
Is your nightgown clinging
to your sweat-soaked body?

337
00:19:36,366 --> 00:19:39,483
- Yes.
- We're on our way.

338
00:19:41,499 --> 00:19:46,090
Hang on here.
How can I hook this up
to watch the tape
if I don't know
how to hook it up?

339
00:19:46,124 --> 00:19:48,942
Uh, two minutes.
Who had two?

340
00:19:52,547 --> 00:19:54,708
Listen, guys, uh,
that was Rebecca.

341
00:19:54,733 --> 00:19:57,167
Uh, slumber party's gone sour.
Let's go help her out.

342
00:19:57,202 --> 00:19:58,769
Wait, wait, Sam,
what about the fight?

343
00:19:58,804 --> 00:20:01,672
Oh, come on.
You think Woody's gonna be
able to fix that?

344
00:20:01,707 --> 00:20:04,141
No one but Carla
can hook up a TV around here.

345
00:20:04,176 --> 00:20:05,962
So we'll go cheer her up
and bring her back.

346
00:20:05,962 --> 00:20:09,312
Don't be so harsh
on the kid, Sam.
Have a little faith here.

347
00:20:09,312 --> 00:20:12,410
Wait a minute.
What are all these wires?

348
00:20:13,269 --> 00:20:16,053
Party's gone sour, you say.

349
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:32,996
Want another s'more?

350
00:20:32,996 --> 00:20:37,682
Not sweet enough for me.
I think I'll just
have a bowl of syrup.

351
00:20:37,742 --> 00:20:41,728
Look, Carla.
Lilith's hair
is coming out nice.

352
00:20:41,763 --> 00:20:44,214
Yeah, in clumps.

353
00:20:45,850 --> 00:20:49,353
Carla, do you want me
to fix your hair, too?
What do you say?

354
00:20:49,388 --> 00:20:52,924
- I say your hour is almost over.
- Right.

355
00:20:52,924 --> 00:20:56,360
Um, let's see what's
next on the list?

356
00:20:56,395 --> 00:21:00,014
Ooh, good!
We get to tell scary stories.

357
00:21:00,048 --> 00:21:03,800
You want to hear a scary story?
I'll tell you a scary story.

358
00:21:03,835 --> 00:21:06,604
My life, that's a scary story.

359
00:21:06,638 --> 00:21:10,524
Wonderful, Carla!
Okay, who's next?

360
00:21:13,612 --> 00:21:17,891
Oh, I hope it's not some boys
trying to crash
our slumber party.

361
00:21:19,050 --> 00:21:20,618
What?!

362
00:21:20,652 --> 00:21:23,303
Hi, listen.
I know, I know you
don't want to see me.

363
00:21:23,338 --> 00:21:25,523
But I'll bet you want to see
the Four Swell Guys.

364
00:21:25,557 --> 00:21:28,540
We're going to be bringing you
memories of your
swinging teenage years.

365
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:31,166
Do you remember this, Carla?

366
00:21:44,465 --> 00:21:46,822
Shut up!

367
00:21:47,529 --> 00:21:49,697
Why do you all
keep coming over here?

368
00:21:49,731 --> 00:21:51,598
We're trying to cheer you up.

369
00:21:51,633 --> 00:21:55,579
Well, stop it!
You can't cheer me up.

370
00:21:55,579 --> 00:21:58,600
Why do people think
they always have to rush over

371
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:02,639
a-and talk somebody out of it
when they're feeling lousy?

372
00:22:03,911 --> 00:22:07,453
Look, this grandmother thing
is just something
I have to work through,

373
00:22:07,453 --> 00:22:09,626
and I will in time.

374
00:22:11,803 --> 00:22:14,137
There's nothing
any of you guys could do.

375
00:22:14,172 --> 00:22:17,439
Unless you can make me 15 again.

376
00:22:18,684 --> 00:22:22,134
Can any of you
make me 15 again?

377
00:22:24,048 --> 00:22:26,467
Well, can you?

378
00:22:29,570 --> 00:22:34,963
Look, if you really
cared about me,
you would just...
get out of my house

379
00:22:34,963 --> 00:22:37,951
and do what I asked you to
a long time ago.

380
00:22:37,951 --> 00:22:41,228
Just... just leave me alone.

381
00:22:44,553 --> 00:22:47,935
You mean you really
want to be left alone?

382
00:22:50,892 --> 00:22:52,827
Let's go, guys. Come on.

383
00:22:52,861 --> 00:22:57,922
The party was stupid.
This was not a stupid party.

384
00:22:57,922 --> 00:23:01,736
Oh, well, I stand corrected.
It was the social event
of the season.

385
00:23:02,237 --> 00:23:03,403
Shut up.

386
00:23:03,438 --> 00:23:05,739
Oh, yeah? You want
a punch in the mouth?

387
00:23:08,409 --> 00:23:11,661
- You're gonna be all right?
- Yeah.

388
00:23:11,696 --> 00:23:14,131
I appreciate
what you tried to do, Sam.

389
00:23:14,165 --> 00:23:16,333
I'll be okay, you know?

390
00:23:16,367 --> 00:23:18,468
You know, something
always comes along,

391
00:23:18,468 --> 00:23:23,694
some little something,
makes everything work out.

392
00:23:23,694 --> 00:23:28,019
- But I got to find it myself.
You can't do it for me.
- All right.

393
00:23:29,681 --> 00:23:31,893
You know my number.

394
00:23:37,923 --> 00:23:40,087
Sorry, Carla, I, uh...

395
00:23:40,087 --> 00:23:43,322
...just forgot my jacket.

396
00:23:50,368 --> 00:23:53,303
Darn these pants.

397
00:23:53,338 --> 00:23:56,351
Why do they keep doing this?
I had them fixed.

398
00:24:03,330 --> 00:24:23,352
translate
