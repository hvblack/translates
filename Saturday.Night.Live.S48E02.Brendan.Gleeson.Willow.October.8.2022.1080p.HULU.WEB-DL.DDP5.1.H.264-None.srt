1
00:00:00,684 --> 00:00:03,602
>>> HELLO, AMERICA.

2
00:00:06,977 --> 00:00:12,383
HAVE YOU NOTICED THAT EVERYONE
AROUND YOU IS ANGRY AND CRAZY?

3
00:00:12,383 --> 00:00:16,331
PEOPLE ARE FLIPPING OUT AT
TARGET, STABBING IS BACK,

4
00:00:16,401 --> 00:00:22,180
AND
THE ONLY THING TO CHEER US UP IS
WATCHING A SEXY SHOW ABOUT
JEFFREY DAHMER.

5
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:25,998
WE ARE LIVING ON THE EDGE, AND
TONIGHT, I'M HERE TO PUSH US OVER

6
00:00:25,998 --> 00:00:31,231
AS WE PLAY "SO YOU THINK
YOU WON'T SNAP."

7
00:00:32,421 --> 00:00:37,932
THAT'S RIGHT.
I'M YOUR HOST, MORGAN FREEGIRL.

8
00:00:37,932 --> 00:00:42,386
TONIGHT WE FOUND THE ONLY PEOPLE
IN AMERICA WHO HAVE NOT YET
SNAPPED.

9
00:00:42,386 --> 00:00:47,471
LET'S MEET 'EM.
IT'S HEATHER, KAYLA, DALE, AND
HENRY.

10
00:00:50,378 --> 00:00:53,515
THE GAME IS SIMPLE.
I'LL READ REAL STORIES FROM THE NEWS

11
00:00:53,515 --> 00:00:56,244
AND IF YOU KEEP YOUR COOL,
YOU'LL WIN BIG MONEY.

12
00:00:56,244 --> 00:00:59,384
ALL RIGHT, HEATHER, YOU'RE UP
FIRST IN THE HOT SPOT.

13
00:01:00,818 --> 00:01:06,113
HEATHER, YOU ARE A MUSIC
PROFESSOR AND WHITE YOGA TEACHER

14
00:01:06,113 --> 00:01:07,669
IN BURLINGTON, VERMONT.

15
00:01:07,669 --> 00:01:12,107
>> YES, I'M JUST KIND OF A CHILL
PERSON, SO I PROMISE YOU'RE NOT
GONNA GET ME.

16
00:01:12,107 --> 00:01:13,262
>> WE'LL SEE ABOUT THAT.

17
00:01:13,262 --> 00:01:16,943
READ YOU
SOME HEADLINES.
TO TELL IF YOU'VE HIT YOUR
BREAKING POINT,

18
00:01:16,943 --> 00:01:21,109
YOU HAVE IN
FRONT OF YOU A "TODAY SHOW"
SIZED GLASS OF WINE.

19
00:01:21,109 --> 00:01:25,779
>> OH, YEAH, I'M NOT GONNA DRINK
THAT.
I'VE BEEN SOBER FOR 15 YEARS.

20
00:01:25,779 --> 00:01:29,141
>> LOVE THAT CONFIDENCE.
LET'S PLAY.

21
00:01:29,141 --> 00:01:31,077
LET'S START WITH UKRAINE.

22
00:01:31,077 --> 00:01:35,103
>> A MASSIVE BRIDGE EXPLOSION
TODAY CUT OFF THE RUSSIAN SUPPLY
CHAIN.

23
00:01:35,103 --> 00:01:38,802
>> I SAW THAT.
HOPEFULLY IT BRINGS THIS WAR ONE
STEP CLOSER TO AN END.

24
00:01:38,802 --> 00:01:43,035
>> RIGHT, BECAUSE ON THURSDAY,
BIDEN SAID WE WERE CLOSER TO
NUCLEAR ARMAGEDDON

25
00:01:43,035 --> 00:01:45,131
THAN WE'VE
BEEN IN 60 YEARS.

26
00:01:45,131 --> 00:01:48,208
>> DON'T KNOW WHERE TO PUT THAT
IN MY BRAIN, BUT I LOVE BIDEN.

27
00:01:48,208 --> 00:01:50,799
>> TOTALLY.
ME, TOO.
DO YOU KNOW HOW OLD HE IS?

28
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:56,803
DID YOU KNOW THAT WHEN JOE BIDEN
WAS BORN, WE DIDN'T HAVE
HIGHWAYS?

29
00:01:56,803 --> 00:01:58,965
>> THAT -- THAT'S A FUN FACT.

30
00:01:58,965 --> 00:02:02,003
>> AND JOE BIDEN WAS 53-YEARS-OLD

31
00:02:02,003 --> 00:02:05,159
WHEN HE GOT HIS
FIRST HOME COMPUTER.

32
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:08,698
>> WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?
>> I'M NOT DOING ANYTHING.

33
00:02:08,698 --> 00:02:12,263
YOU NEED A SIP OF THAT WINE?
>> NO.
I'M TOTALLY GOOD.

34
00:02:12,263 --> 00:02:14,645
>> WELL, YOUR NEXT ITEM IS A
VIDEO CLUE.

35
00:02:14,645 --> 00:02:18,708
PLEASE ENJOY THIS CLIP OF BIDEN
TALKING ABOUT HIS MENTAL ACUITY.

36
00:02:18,708 --> 00:02:21,787
>> HOW WOULD YOU SAY YOUR MENTAL
FOCUS IS?

37
00:02:21,787 --> 00:02:24,101
>> OH, IT IS FOCUSED.

38
00:02:24,412 --> 00:02:28,501
I THINK -- I THINK IT'S -- I --
I HAVEN'T -- LOOK.

39
00:02:30,359 --> 00:02:33,009
>> OH.
AND THAT'S A SNAP.

40
00:02:33,009 --> 00:02:35,475
>> MM, MAMA MISSED YOU.

41
00:02:35,475 --> 00:02:39,882
>> UP NEXT IS KAYLA.
KAYLA, GET IN THE HOT SPOT.

42
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,446
WELCOME, KAYLA.

43
00:02:42,446 --> 00:02:46,971
YOU SAID YOU ARE A MOM, AND ARE
PICKLEBALL CURIOUS.

44
00:02:46,971 --> 00:02:50,545
>> YEAH, YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.
I'M BLESSED WITH FOUR BEAUTIFUL
CHILDREN

45
00:02:50,545 --> 00:02:53,409
AND I DON'T HAVE TIME
TO WORRY ABOUT ANYTHING ELSE.

46
00:02:53,409 --> 00:02:57,561
>> MM-HM, RIGHT.
WELL, NEXT TO YOU IS TRACY, A
FLIGHT ATTENDANT FOR FRONTIER AIRLINES,

47
00:02:57,561 --> 00:03:01,720
AND IF YOU WANT, YOU
CAN HIT HER.

48
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:02,884
>> HELLO.

49
00:03:02,884 --> 00:03:05,295
>> WHAT?
OH, GOSH, NO.
I -- I DON'T HIT PEOPLE.

50
00:03:05,295 --> 00:03:08,786
>> THEY GET HIT ALL THE TIME,
THERE MUST BE A GOOD REASON.

51
00:03:08,786 --> 00:03:10,660
LET'S PLAY.

52
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:14,093
LET'S START WITH THE GEORGIA
SENATE CANDIDATE
HERSCHEL WALKER.

53
00:03:14,093 --> 00:03:16,683
>> OH, OH, THE FOOTBALL PLAYER.
I -- I LIKE HIM,

54
00:03:16,707 --> 00:03:20,331
SUPPORT

55
00:03:20,331 --> 00:03:23,555
PAID

56
00:03:23,555 --> 00:03:26,651
BET

57
00:03:26,651 --> 00:03:30,012
FUNDRAISER

58
00:03:30,012 --> 00:03:32,343
COMPUTE

59
00:03:32,343 --> 00:03:36,092
POLITICS

60
00:03:36,092 --> 00:03:40,258
SURE. YOU'RE MOM.
DID YOU KNOW THATF 84% OF KIDS

61
00:03:40,345 --> 00:03:44,294
WHEN THEY GROW UP SAY THEY WANT
TO BE INFLUENCER.

62
00:03:44,294 --> 00:03:48,978
>> WELL, THAT SOUNDS GOOD, BUT
MY KS ARE SERIOUS.

63
00:03:48,978 --> 00:03:53,804
>> AND SO NOW, LET'S LOOK AT A
TRAILER FROM CHRIS PRATT.

64
00:03:53,805 --> 00:03:55,613
TAKE A LOOK

65
00:03:56,708 --> 00:04:01,146
>> MUSHROOM KINGDOM, HERE WE
COME.

66
00:04:01,146 --> 00:04:03,609
>> HE IS SUPPOSED TO BE ITALIAN.

67
00:04:03,609 --> 00:04:06,633
THAT IS HIS WHOLE THING.

68
00:04:10,545 --> 00:04:12,307
>> OH, IT WAS INEVITABLE.

69
00:04:12,307 --> 00:04:16,173
WELL, IT IS TIME FOR OUR NEXT
CONTESTANT.
GET UP HERE, DALE.

70
00:04:18,355 --> 00:04:19,705
>> HELLO.

71
00:04:19,756 --> 00:04:24,053
>> DALE, YOU SAID THAT YOU ARE
TAKING ADVANTAGE OF BIDEN'S NEW WEED POLICY,

72
00:04:24,053 --> 00:04:27,220
AND YOU HAD SEX
RIGHT BEFORE COMING ON THE SHOW?

73
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:29,316
>> YES, I SURE DID.

74
00:04:29,316 --> 00:04:31,538
GOD BLESS AMERICA.

75
00:04:31,538 --> 00:04:34,750
>> DALE, FOR YOUR ROUND, A
NUMBER OF SWEETS

76
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:37,356
SNAP

77
00:04:37,356 --> 00:04:40,581
NOTHING

78
00:04:40,582 --> 00:04:42,994
OF COURSE

79
00:04:43,233 --> 00:04:46,207
ELON MUSK --

80
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:51,362
>> OH, THAT MAN MAKES ME SNAP.

81
00:04:51,362 --> 00:04:57,134
THAT DUDE IS TALKING ABOUT GOING
TO MARS WHEN I WANT TO HAVE A
MARS.

82
00:05:00,777 --> 00:05:02,336
THANKS

83
00:05:02,336 --> 00:05:05,642

STUDENT

STEAM HOT
IRON IN FRONT OF YOU IN CASE YOU
NEED TO HIT YOUR HANDS.

89
00:05:21,481 --> 00:05:24,192

90
00:05:24,192 --> 00:05:26,977
GREAT

91
00:05:26,977 --> 00:05:30,247
401ks are down by 20%

92
00:05:30,247 --> 00:05:32,718
DON'T BOTHER

93
00:05:32,718 --> 00:05:36,296
ANNOUNCED

94
00:05:36,296 --> 00:05:40,424
THE ORANGE M&M HAS ANXIETY.

95
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:43,215
>> THAT IS A CANDY.

96
00:05:43,215 --> 00:05:47,747
>> AND KAYNE WEST.

97
00:05:47,747 --> 00:05:51,835

00:05:57,936 --> 00:06:01,852
>> AND NOW HE SAID THAT HE HAS

102
00:06:01,852 --> 00:06:04,137

103
00:06:04,137 --> 00:06:06,033
GEARS

>> AND HE WAS TUCKER CARLSON.

105
00:06:10,485 --> 00:06:12,484
>> OH, MAN, HAVE A HEART.

106
00:06:12,484 --> 00:06:14,884

WHITE

109
00:06:25,214 --> 00:06:26,879
>> AH, THERE WE GO.

110
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:31,802
WHEN WE COME BACK, WE WILL SHOW
AN 80-YEAR-OLD MAN AN EPISODE OF
EUPHORIA AND

111
00:06:31,802 --> 00:06:36,549
LIVE FROM NEW
YORK, IT'S SATURDAY NIGHT!

112
00:08:28,785 --> 00:08:34,245
HOST

113
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:43,044
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
BRENDAN GLEESON.

114
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,158
>> THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK
YOU VERY MUCH.

115
00:09:06,158 --> 00:09:09,136
HI, WELL, I'M BRENDAN GLEESON.

116
00:09:09,198 --> 00:09:13,427
AND IF YOU DON'T RECOGNIZE THE
ACCENT, I'M IRISH.

117
00:09:14,043 --> 00:09:18,178
AND IF YOU DON'T RECOGNIZE THE
FACE, I'M THAT FELLOW THAT
YOU'VE SEEN IN THAT THING

118
00:09:18,178 --> 00:09:21,135
YOU
CAN'T REMEMBER, BUT YOU THINK
THAT YOU KIND OF LIKE.

119
00:09:21,135 --> 00:09:23,701
YEAH, THAT WAS ME.
LET ME SEE.

120
00:09:23,701 --> 00:09:28,413
YOU'VE PROBABLY SEEN ME IN
BRAVEHEART.

121
00:09:29,829 --> 00:09:34,166
YOU'VE POSSIBLY SEEN ME IN
HARRY POTTER.

122
00:09:35,862 --> 00:09:41,491
YOU DEFINITELY HAVEN'T SEEN ME
IN JOEL COHEN'S BLACK AND WHITE MACBETH,

123
00:09:42,458 --> 00:09:46,191
BUT YOU SHOULD CHECK
IT OUT.
I THINK IT'S GREAT.

124
00:09:47,045 --> 00:09:50,235
NOW, I'M NOT REALLY USED TO
TELLING JOKES,

125
00:09:50,235 --> 00:09:52,915
SO I THOUGHT I'D
PLAY A TUNE FOR YOU INSTEAD.

126
00:09:52,915 --> 00:09:55,436
CAN I GET MY MANDOLIN?

127
00:09:57,957 --> 00:10:01,381
THIS IS THE FIRST TUNE I EVER
LEARNED.

128
00:10:01,381 --> 00:10:06,223
IT WAS MADE FAMOUS BY A MAN
CALLED BARNEY McKENNA.

129
00:10:12,494 --> 00:10:16,254
BARNEY WAS THE BANJO PLAYER WITH
THE DUBLINERS.

130
00:10:17,299 --> 00:10:20,863
AND THEY WERE TRAVELING TO A
VERY HOT COUNTRY ONE TIME,

131
00:10:20,863 --> 00:10:25,286
AND
BARNEY WAS TOLD IT WOULD BE
104 DEGREES IN THE SHADE.

132
00:10:25,287 --> 00:10:28,902
104 DEGREES IN THE SHADE.

133
00:10:28,902 --> 00:10:33,487
BARNEY SAYS.
"I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE NEAR THE"
SHADE."

134
00:10:40,075 --> 00:10:45,618
YOU KNOW, MY FAMILY HAD VARYING
DEGREES OF MUSICALITY.

135
00:10:45,727 --> 00:10:48,521
MY LOVELY AUNTIE NELL, FOR EXAMPLE,

136
00:10:48,521 --> 00:10:52,151
WAS FAMOUS BECAUSE HER
HIGH NOTES COULD SHATTER GLASS.

137
00:10:52,214 --> 00:10:55,869
ALL THE KIDS WERE TERRIFIED
SHE'D BURST INTO SONG AT ANY MOMENT,

138
00:10:55,869 --> 00:10:58,955
ESPECIALLY THE KIDS WITH
GLASSES.

139
00:11:02,427 --> 00:11:04,707
WHEREAS MY FATHER DIDN'T HAVE A NOTE,

140
00:11:04,707 --> 00:11:07,993
WELL, HE DID HAVE ONE NOTE,

141
00:11:08,069 --> 00:11:10,564
BUT HE HAD HIS OWN WAY OF GOING ON

142
00:11:10,564 --> 00:11:14,864
AND WHEN HE SANG IN OUR
SONG, MY SON FERGUS ASKED HIM,

143
00:11:14,864 --> 00:11:20,201
"GRANDDAD, WHY DO YOU COMB YOUR"
HAIR BEFORE YOU GET INTO BED?"

144
00:11:20,201 --> 00:11:24,768
AND DAD SAID, "BECAUSE YOU NEVER
KNOW WHO YOU MIGHT MEET IN YOUR
DREAMS."

145
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:33,352
WEIRD AND
WONDERFUL.

146
00:11:33,645 --> 00:11:38,500
I'LL TELL YOU WHO ELSE IS WEIRD
AND WONDERFUL.
COLIN FARRELL.

147
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:41,954
WE WORKED TOGETHER ON "IN
BRUGES" --

148
00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:47,639
AND WE JUST GOT BACK TOGETHER
FOR A NEW FILM, "THE BANSHEES OF
INISHERIN."

149
00:11:48,796 --> 00:11:52,479
FUNNY ENOUGH, IT'S ABOUT TWO
FELLOWS WHO FALL OUT

150
00:11:52,479 --> 00:11:55,399
BECAUSE ONE

318
00:19:18,077 --> 00:19:24,849
WHATEVER IT IS, NEVER FORGET.

319
00:19:24,851 --> 00:19:26,384
FOR CNN, I'M COLLIN O'DIRTY.

320
00:19:26,386 --> 00:19:27,985
>> AND THEY ARE MILLIONAIRES.

321
00:19:27,987 --> 00:19:28,519
OKAY, I'M GOING TO GO SEE WHAT

322
00:19:28,521 --> 00:19:31,656
KETAMINE IS ALL ABOUT.

323
00:19:31,658 --> 00:19:32,723
THIS HAS BEEN CNN.

324
00:19:32,725 --> 00:19:34,325
GOODNIGHT.

325
00:19:42,976 --> 00:19:45,649
NEW IN

326
00:19:45,649 --> 00:19:48,702
>>> BEING A NEW CAST MEMBER AT
SNL, YOU GET A LOT OF ADVICE.

327
00:19:48,702 --> 00:19:52,158
>> ADVICE FROM FRIENDS, FAMILY,
VETERAN CAST MEMBERS

328
00:19:52,158 --> 00:19:53,170
EVEN
LORNE.

329
00:19:53,170 --> 00:19:56,642
LORNE TOLD ME, "DON'T DO TOO
MUCH IN THE FIRST COUPLE SHOWS."

330
00:19:56,642 --> 00:19:59,691
>> LET THE AUDIENCE DISCOVER YOU
AND GET TO KNOW YOU.

331
00:19:59,691 --> 00:20:01,885
>> UNTIL WE FIND WRITERS WHO
UNDERSTAND MY VOICE,

332
00:20:01,885 --> 00:20:05,139
MY ODD
HAUNTING VOICE.

333
00:20:05,139 --> 00:20:06,412
>> HE TOLD ME TO JUST BE ME.

334
00:20:06,412 --> 00:20:09,479
TO TRUST MY INSTINCTS FROM
STAND-UP.
AND I KNOW HOW TO HANDLE AN
AUDIENCE.

335
00:20:09,479 --> 00:20:10,787
HE WAS REALLY SWEET ABOUT IT.

336
00:20:10,787 --> 00:20:12,705
>> SEE?
THIS IS ALL KIND OF CRAZY TO HEAR,

337
00:20:12,705 --> 00:20:15,413
BECAUSE ON DAY ONE, LORNE
TOLD ME WHEN HE OFF, AND HE SAID,

338
00:20:15,413 --> 00:20:17,963
"MOLLY, THERE IS ONLY ONE
REASON YOU ARE HERE.

339
00:20:17,963 --> 00:20:20,106
I NEED YOU TO KILL
VLADIMIR PUTIN."

340
00:20:20,106 --> 00:20:21,640
HE GAVE ME THIS GUN.

341
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:24,722
HE SAID, "DON'T WORRY, THE
SERIAL NUMBERS HAVE BEEN
SCRATCHED OFF.

342
00:20:24,722 --> 00:20:26,885
HE'LL NEVER TRACE IT BACK TO
US."

343
00:20:26,885 --> 00:20:28,854
I'M LIKE, "US?"

344
00:20:28,854 --> 00:20:33,181
>> I, FOR ONE, HAD SAID, "DON'T
EXPECT TO SEE IN A BUNCH OF
SKETCHES RIGHT AWAY."

345
00:20:33,181 --> 00:20:35,692
>> LORNE SAID TO REALLY TAKE MY
TIME.

346
00:20:35,692 --> 00:20:38,422
YOU KNOW, MAYBE, DON'T EVEN
WRITE A SKETCH UNTIL CHRISTMAS.

347
00:20:38,422 --> 00:20:40,322
>> MY UNCLE SAID, "MAKE SURE TO
GET AN ACCOUNTANT,

348
00:20:40,322 --> 00:20:42,735
AND WATCH
HIM, BECAUSE SOMEBODY WILL TAKE
MY MONEY."

349
00:20:42,735 --> 00:20:45,831
>> I TOLD LORNE, "PLEASE DON'T
MAKE ME DO THIS.

350
00:20:45,831 --> 00:20:49,075
I WOULD RATHER BE ON SKETCHES,
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT I CAME HERE
TO DO."

351
00:20:49,075 --> 00:20:52,120
AND LORNE GOES, "EVERYBODY HAS
DONE SKETCHES,

352
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:55,177
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT
WILL FERRELL AND ADAM SANDLER
NEVER DID?

353
00:20:55,177 --> 00:20:57,834
KILL VLADIMIR PUTIN."

354
00:20:57,834 --> 00:21:01,348
I TOLD MY AGENT ABOUT THIS.

355
00:21:01,348 --> 00:21:04,007
RESPONSE

356
00:21:04,007 --> 00:21:07,563
>> DAVID SPADE CALLED AND SAID,
"CONGRATS ON YOUR FIRST UPDATE"
FEATURE.

357
00:21:07,563 --> 00:21:10,608
WE'RE BOTH FROM ARIZONA, SO THAT
WAS REALLY COOL.

358
00:21:10,608 --> 00:21:12,596
>> I GOT FLOWERS FROM
KRISTIN WIIG.

359
00:21:12,596 --> 00:21:15,183
I WAS LIKE, "THAT'S INSANE."
I CAN'T EVEN BELIEVE SHE KNOWS
WHO I AM.

360
00:21:15,183 --> 00:21:19,262
>> I GET A CALL IN THE MIDDLE OF
THE NIGHT.
IT'S FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE,
JOHN KERRY.

361
00:21:19,262 --> 00:21:23,370
AND HE SAID, "COME ON, LORNE.
CAN YOU BE HERE IN 10 MINUTES
WITH YOUR BAGS PACKED?"

362
00:21:23,370 --> 00:21:25,258
I'M THINKING, "PACKED WITH
WHAT?"

363
00:21:25,352 --> 00:21:28,302
>> I FEEL LIKE HE WAS PART OF A
LARGER FAMILY, ALL OF A SUDDEN.

364
00:21:28,302 --> 00:21:31,787
I SAW MY PHOTO ON THE SAME WALL
WITH EDDIE MURPHY.
I MEAN, "THAT'S CRAZY."

365
00:21:31,787 --> 00:21:34,062
THAT I WAS RECOGNIZED

366
00:21:34,062 --> 00:21:36,990
AND THEY
THOUGHT THAT I WAS KEENAN, BUT
THAT IS OKAY.

367
00:21:36,991 --> 00:21:39,245
AND SO, I GET TO LORNE'S AT 4:00
A.M.

368
00:21:39,245 --> 00:21:42,824
IT'S JOHN KERRY, BILL GATES AND,
WEIRDLY, KELLY RIPA.

369
00:21:42,824 --> 00:21:47,024
WE CAN GET YOU TO RUSSIA, BUT WE
CAN'T PROMISE WE CAN GET YOU
OUT.

370
00:21:47,024 --> 00:21:50,573
AND I REALLY WANT TO BE ON
SNL, SO I'M JUST, LIKE, NODDING MY HEAD

371
00:21:50,573 --> 00:21:52,433
AND SAYING,
ANYTHING YOU SAY, SIR.

372
00:21:52,433 --> 00:21:55,398
AND KELLY RIPA IS REALLY SWEET.
SHE LIKE, "WHATEVER HAPPENS,

373
00:21:55,398 --> 00:21:57,768
JUST KNOW YOUR FAMILY WILL BE
TAKEN CARE OF."

374
00:21:57,768 --> 00:22:02,025
BUT LIKE, IS KELLY RIPA GOING TO
PAY FOR MY FUNERAL?

375
00:22:02,025 --> 00:22:03,837
WRITING PROCESS

376
00:22:03,837 --> 00:22:07,946
>> I'M WORKING ON A SKETCH THIS
WEEK AND LORNE SAID, "DON'T RUSH
INTO IT."

377
00:22:07,946 --> 00:22:12,829
HE SAID, "EVEN IF I'M NOT IN ANY
SKETCHES FOR THE FIRST YEAR OR
TWO, THAT'S FINE."

378
00:22:12,829 --> 00:22:17,269
>> I TOLD LORNE I WAS WORKING ON
A SKETCH FOR ME AND MOLLY, AND
HE JUST, KIND OF, STARED OFF
INTO THE DISTANCE AND SAID,

379
00:22:17,269 --> 00:22:19,737
"IF
WE EVER SEE MOLLY AGAIN."

380
00:22:19,737 --> 00:22:20,999
I KNEW THAT AIN'T FEEL RIGHT.

381
00:22:20,999 --> 00:22:24,179
>> I'M THROWN IN BACK OF A VAN.
I HEAR A MILITARY GUY SCREAM,

382
00:22:24,179 --> 00:22:27,329
"IF SHE GETS CAPTURED OVER"
THERE, SHE IS ON HER OWN."

383
00:22:27,329 --> 00:22:31,023
AND I WANT HER TO BE LIKE --
IT'S ACTUALLY LIKE -- IT'S
ACTUALLY "THEY," NOT "SHE."

384
00:22:31,023 --> 00:22:33,965
BUT IT DIDN'T SEEM LIKE THE
RIGHT MOMENT FOR THE PRONOUN
TALK.

385
00:22:33,965 --> 00:22:37,766
THEN WE DRIVED STRAIGHT THROUGH
THE NIGHT AT, LIKE, 150 MILES AN HOUR

386
00:22:37,766 --> 00:22:42,657
AND I'M LIKE, "WHOA!"
THE HOURS AT "SNL" IS REALLY ARE
CRAZY.

387
00:22:42,657 --> 00:22:44,870
FRIENDS

388
00:22:44,870 --> 00:22:48,379
>> WE WERE TEXTING EACH OTHER
THE FIRST WEEK LIKE, "GOOD LUCK," "BREAK A LEG,"

389
00:22:48,379 --> 00:22:50,686
AND THEN
MOLLY TEXTED, "I HAVE TO KILL."

390
00:22:50,686 --> 00:22:53,194
IT'S LIKE, "DON'T PUT THAT KIND
OF PRESSURE ON YOURSELF."

391
00:22:53,194 --> 00:22:55,764
>> YOU REALIZE THERE'S THIS
WHOLE COMMUNITY OF PEOPLE WHO WORK AT "SNL,"

392
00:22:55,764 --> 00:22:58,000
AND WE'RE ALL
JUST HERE TO DO COMEDY.

393
00:22:58,298 --> 00:23:00,531
EXCEPT, APPARENTLY, MOLLY.

394
00:23:00,531 --> 00:23:04,548
>> THE VAN SCREECHES TO A HALT.
THEY THROW ME ON TO A DOCK, RIP
OFF THE HOOD.

395
00:23:04,548 --> 00:23:06,730
AND I'M LIKE, "IS THIS THE
PANAMA CANAL?"

396
00:23:06,730 --> 00:23:09,638
THEN A GUY WALKS UP IN A SAFARI
HAT AND A WHITE MUSTACHE.

397
00:23:09,638 --> 00:23:12,806
I SWEAR TO GOD IT WAS LORNE'S
TWIN BROTHER,

398
00:23:12,806 --> 00:23:17,643
AND HE SAYS --

399
00:23:17,643 --> 00:23:21,579
THEN THEY DRIVE AWAY, AND I GO
TO CALL AN UBER, BUT I CAN'T USE MY PHONE

400
00:23:21,579 --> 00:23:23,860
BECAUSE THEY BURNT MY
BETTER BREAD PHONE.

401
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:26,993
>> AT THE END OF THE DAY, YOU'LL
HAVE TO REALIZE YOU'RE GOING TO
HAVE GOOD SHOWS AND BAD SHOWS.

402
00:23:26,993 --> 00:23:28,895
LAST WEEK, I GOT ON WEEKEND
UPDATE.

403
00:23:28,895 --> 00:23:31,397
THIS WEEK, I GET TO PLAY
KANYE WEST.

404
00:23:31,397 --> 00:23:33,196
YOU JUST HAVE TO ENJOY THE RIDE.

405
00:23:33,196 --> 00:23:37,771
>> EXACTLY.
DON'T TRY TO WRITE OR PITCH
IDEAS.

406
00:23:37,771 --> 00:23:40,852
DON'T EXPECT ANYONE TO PUT YOU IN SKETCHES

407
00:23:40,852 --> 00:23:43,726
OR GIVE YOU A COMPUTER OR AN OFFICE

408
00:23:43,726 --> 00:23:46,805
OR AN I.D.
SO YOU GET INSIDE THE BUILDING.

409
00:23:46,805 --> 00:23:49,172
YOU JUST GOT TO CHILL AT HOME.

410
00:23:49,172 --> 00:23:53,010
>> AND BE MORE EXCITING THAT
THERE ARE FOUR NEW CAST MEMBERS
SO WE CAN EXPERIENCE IT
TOGETHER.

411
00:23:53,010 --> 00:23:55,403
>> LONG STORY SHORT, MOST OF MY
FIRST WEEK AT "SNL"

412
00:23:55,403 --> 00:23:58,236
IS ABOUT
CONNECTING BUSES THROUGH
CENTRAL AMERICA.

413
00:23:58,236 --> 00:24:00,710
BUT I MADE IT RIGHT BEFORE THE SHOW OPEN,

414
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:04,195
AND JUST BEFORE THE
COLD OPEN STARTED, LORNE CAME UP
TO ME AND SAID,

415
00:24:04,195 --> 00:24:06,885
"MOLLY, I'M
REALLY PROUD OF YOU."

416
00:24:06,885 --> 00:24:10,380
AND JUST SO YOU KNOW, WE NEVER
MAKE CAST MEMBERS KILL PEOPLE.

417
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:12,515
I THOUGHT THAT WAS REALLY COOL.

418
00:24:12,515 --> 00:24:15,516
>> WAIT, SO I DIDN'T HAVE TO
KILL OSAMA BIN LADEN?

419
00:24:15,584 --> 00:24:19,972
NOW I GOT TO PAY FOR IT.

420
00:24:25,296 --> 00:24:35,806
>>> THIS FALL, NETFLIX RELEASED

421
00:24:27,808 --> 00:24:34,146
BLONDE.

422
00:24:34,148 --> 00:24:38,951
AN NC-17 NO HOLES BARRED LOOK AT

423
00:24:38,953 --> 00:24:39,985
THE LIFE OF MARILYN MONROE,

424
00:24:39,987 --> 00:24:40,686
HERE'S A PREVIEW.

425
00:24:40,688 --> 00:24:41,119
>> MARILYN, WHAT'S THE HOLD UP?

426
00:24:41,121 --> 00:24:42,621
WE'RE ABOUT TO SHOOT THE BIG

427
00:24:42,623 --> 00:24:43,155
DANCE NUMBER.

428
00:24:43,157 --> 00:24:43,856
>> I'M JUST GOING TO MESS IT UP,

429
00:24:43,858 --> 00:24:45,290
DADDY.

430
00:24:45,292 --> 00:24:46,024
IT'S LIKE I'M A SLAVE TO THIS

431
00:24:46,026 --> 00:24:46,859
MARILYN MONROE.

432
00:24:46,861 --> 00:24:54,032
>> OH, DON'T SAY THAT, MARILYN.

433
00:24:54,034 --> 00:24:59,204
EVERYBODY LOVES YOU.

434
00:24:59,206 --> 00:25:01,807
AND TO CHEER YOU UP, I BROUGHT

435
00:25:01,809 --> 00:25:02,674
IN DEVIN AND AGNES FROM THE

436
00:25:02,676 --> 00:25:08,747
STUDIO TO READ YOU ALL OF YOUR

437
00:25:08,749 --> 00:25:09,248
ADORING FAN MAIL.

438
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:10,282
COME ON IN, LADIES.

439
00:25:10,284 --> 00:25:11,350
>> WOW.

440
00:25:11,352 --> 00:25:12,417
OH, WOW, IS THAT A PAINTING OR A

441
00:25:12,419 --> 00:25:13,118
LADY?

442
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:13,986
>> LOOK, YOU'RE MARILYN MONROE.

443
00:25:13,988 --> 00:25:14,686
YOU'RE EVEN PRETTIER THAN THE

444
00:25:14,688 --> 00:25:16,088
PICTURE.

445
00:25:16,090 --> 00:25:16,822
>> YOU SURE DO HAVE A LOT OF

446
00:25:16,824 --> 00:25:17,656
FANS, MISS MONROE.

447
00:25:17,658 --> 00:25:18,724
THIS IS THE MOST MAIL WE'VE EVER

448
00:25:18,726 --> 00:25:19,758
SEEN.

449
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:20,459
>> WE HAD TO CARRY IT ALL UP

450
00:25:20,461 --> 00:25:20,826
AWAY FROM THE BASEMENT, BUT IT'S

451
00:25:20,828 --> 00:25:21,360
WORTH IT IF IT MAKES YOU FEEL

452
00:25:21,362 --> 00:25:22,928
BETTER.

453
00:25:22,930 --> 00:25:23,996
>> SEE MARILYN?

454
00:25:23,998 --> 00:25:24,496
THEY LOVE YOU.

455
00:25:24,498 --> 00:25:25,130
>> AND I DO NEED THE LOVE,

456
00:25:25,132 --> 00:25:26,098
DADDY.

457
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:26,832
LET'S HEAR THOSE LETTERS.

458
00:25:26,834 --> 00:25:27,699
>> HERE'S -- HERE'S ONE.

459
00:25:27,701 --> 00:25:28,233
MARILYN, YOU ARE THE SWEETHEART

460
00:25:28,235 --> 00:25:28,734
OF THIS AND ANY OTHER MONTH.

461
00:25:28,736 --> 00:25:29,835
>> AW.

462
00:25:29,837 --> 00:25:30,535
>> AW.

463
00:25:30,537 --> 00:25:31,069
EVEN FEBRUARY?

464
00:25:31,071 --> 00:25:31,904
OH, SHUCKS, I'M BEGINNING TO

465
00:25:31,906 --> 00:25:32,537
FEEL BETTER ALREADY.

466
00:25:32,539 --> 00:25:33,505
>> HERE'S ANOTHER.

467
00:25:33,507 --> 00:25:35,073
MARILYN, I WISH I WAS YOU.

468
00:25:35,075 --> 00:25:38,277
>> AH.

469
00:25:38,279 --> 00:25:39,311
>> MY TURN.

470
00:25:39,313 --> 00:25:41,413
MARILYN, YOU ARE A WHORE, BLONDE

471
00:25:41,415 --> 00:25:47,286
AND FRAIL.

472
00:25:47,288 --> 00:25:49,922
NO ONE WILL EVER LOVE YOU, YOU

473
00:25:49,924 --> 00:25:51,623
DISGUSTING TRAMP.

474
00:25:51,625 --> 00:25:53,825
YOU ARE POISONING OUR CHILDREN,

475
00:25:53,827 --> 00:25:55,894
YOU TRAMP.

476
00:25:55,896 --> 00:25:56,161
>> THAT SEEMS A LITTLE MEAN.

477
00:25:56,163 --> 00:25:57,362
>> THAT ONE MUST HAVE BEEN MIXED

478
00:25:57,364 --> 00:25:59,197
UP.

479
00:25:59,199 --> 00:26:01,300
>> THIS IS ANOTHER ONE.

480
00:26:01,302 --> 00:26:02,367
MARILYN, YOU ARE A SWEETHEART

481
00:26:02,369 --> 00:26:05,304
AND YOUR SMILE IS A SWEETHEART,

482
00:26:05,306 --> 00:26:06,505
TOO.

483
00:26:06,507 --> 00:26:08,040
YOU ARE A SWEETHEART SWEETHEART,

484
00:26:08,042 --> 00:26:11,710
LOVE LOUISVILLE.

485
00:26:11,712 --> 00:26:13,512
>> I LOVE LOUISVILLE.

486
00:26:13,514 --> 00:26:16,214
I THINK THAT I AM READY SO START

487
00:26:16,216 --> 00:26:27,492
THAT SCENE.

488
00:26:27,494 --> 00:26:32,698
>> MARILYN, YOU ARE A DUMB

489
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:33,765
BABOON AND YOUR BRAIN IS IN YOUR

490
00:26:33,767 --> 00:26:34,266
BUTT, AND I'D LIKE TO KICK IT.

491
00:26:34,268 --> 00:26:35,367
NOT A FAN.

492
00:26:35,369 --> 00:26:36,101
>> OKAY.

493
00:26:36,103 --> 00:26:36,902
>> WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?

494
00:26:36,904 --> 00:26:38,537
>> MAYBE WE COULD, LIKE, SCREEN

495
00:26:38,539 --> 00:26:39,037
THESE A LITTLE AND IF THEY GET

496
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:40,072
REALLY MEAN, I DON'T KNOW, LIKE,

497
00:26:40,074 --> 00:26:40,806
BAIL?

498
00:26:40,808 --> 00:26:41,673
>> WELL, IT'S HARD, MS. MONROE,

499
00:26:41,675 --> 00:26:42,407
BECAUSE SOME OF THEM START NICE

500
00:26:42,409 --> 00:26:43,241
AND END MEAN.

501
00:26:43,243 --> 00:26:43,976
>> AND THEN SOME OF THEM START

502
00:26:43,978 --> 00:26:44,843
MEAN AND END NICE.

503
00:26:44,845 --> 00:26:45,577
>> AND THEN SOME OF THEM START

504
00:26:45,579 --> 00:26:46,178
MEAN AND JUST END.

505
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:46,979
>> WELL, DO SOME OF THEM START

506
00:26:46,981 --> 00:26:47,579
NICE AND JUST STAY NICE?

507
00:26:47,581 --> 00:26:48,547
>> SURE.

508
00:26:48,549 --> 00:26:49,081
HERE'S ONE MISS MONROE.

509
00:26:49,083 --> 00:26:50,115
>> ARE YOU SURE IT'S ALL NICE?

510
00:26:50,117 --> 00:26:51,683
>> YEAH.

511
00:26:51,685 --> 00:26:52,417
>> YOU READ THE WHOLE THING?

512
00:26:52,419 --> 00:26:52,751
>> YEAH.

513
00:26:52,753 --> 00:26:53,285
>> FRONT TO BACK, SIDE TO SIDE?

514
00:26:53,287 --> 00:26:54,853
>> YEAH.

515
00:26:54,855 --> 00:26:56,989
>> ALL RIGHT.

516
00:26:56,991 --> 00:26:59,091
GO AHEAD.

517
00:26:59,093 --> 00:26:59,591
>> MARILYN, YOU ARE A WHORE.

518
00:26:59,593 --> 00:27:01,193
NOT A FAN.

519
00:27:01,195 --> 00:27:02,761
>> HERE'S AN IDEA.

520
00:27:02,763 --> 00:27:03,295
MAYBE IF IT SAYS "WHORE," WE

521
00:27:03,297 --> 00:27:05,397
SKIP THAT AND SAY "FLOWER"

522
00:27:05,399 --> 00:27:06,431
INSTEAD.

523
00:27:06,433 --> 00:27:09,601
>> OH, YOU GOT IT.

524
00:27:09,603 --> 00:27:10,635
MARILYN, YOU WERE BORN A FLOWER,

525
00:27:10,637 --> 00:27:13,805
AND YOU WILL DIE A FLOWER.

526
00:27:13,807 --> 00:27:15,407
>> YOU ARE A DIRTY FLOWER, AND

527
00:27:15,409 --> 00:27:16,441
YOUR MOTHER WAS A FLOWER, TOO.

528
00:27:16,443 --> 00:27:18,043
>> OH, OH, I FOUND A GOOD ONE.

529
00:27:18,045 --> 00:27:21,179
I REALLY LOOK UP TO YOU.

530
00:27:21,181 --> 00:27:24,349
>> AH.

531
00:27:24,351 --> 00:27:26,451
>> I'M ALSO A FLOWER.

532
00:27:26,453 --> 00:27:31,556
NOT A FAN.

533
00:27:31,558 --> 00:27:34,192
>> OKAY.

534
00:27:34,194 --> 00:27:35,227
EVERYONE HATES MARILYN MONROE.

535
00:27:35,229 --> 00:27:36,294
I SHOULD HAVE STAYED NORMA JEAN.

536
00:27:36,296 --> 00:27:37,863
>> WELL, THIS IS ADDRESSED TO

537
00:27:37,865 --> 00:27:38,563
NORMA JEAN.

538
00:27:38,565 --> 00:27:39,264
>> NORMA JEAN?!

539
00:27:39,266 --> 00:27:39,965
ONLY IN THE WORLD, PROUDLY --

540
00:27:39,967 --> 00:27:41,033
ONLY ONE PERSON IN THE WORLD

541
00:27:41,035 --> 00:27:41,533
CALLS ME THAT.

542
00:27:41,535 --> 00:27:43,635
>> NORMA JEAN, IT'S YOUR DAD.

543
00:27:43,637 --> 00:27:44,302
NOT A FAN.

544
00:27:44,304 --> 00:27:45,203
>> OKAY.

545
00:27:45,205 --> 00:27:46,805
>> IF HE'S NOT A FAN OF --

546
00:27:46,807 --> 00:27:48,373
MAYBE HE'S BEEN --

547
00:27:48,375 --> 00:27:49,474
>> WELL, MAYBE WE DON'T READ ANY

548
00:27:49,476 --> 00:27:50,208
THAT SAY "NOT A FAN AT ALL."

549
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:52,077
IS THAT OKAY?

550
00:27:52,079 --> 00:27:53,178
ALSO, I'M SORRY, WHO ARE YOU TWO

551
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:54,713
AGAIN?

552
00:27:54,715 --> 00:27:55,781
>> WELL, WE'RE YOUR FAN MAIL

553
00:27:55,783 --> 00:27:58,917
READERS.

554
00:27:58,919 --> 00:28:01,053
>> AND THAT'S, LIKE, THE WHOLE

555
00:28:01,055 --> 00:28:01,753
JOB?

556
00:28:01,755 --> 00:28:02,621
>> WELL, WE ARE ALSO VEERING FOR

557
00:28:02,623 --> 00:28:04,189
SOME OF THE GAY STARS, BUT WE

558
00:28:04,191 --> 00:28:08,093
CAN'T SAY WHICH, ROCK HUDSON.

559
00:28:08,095 --> 00:28:09,161
>> OKAY.

560
00:28:09,163 --> 00:28:11,129
I THINK I'M ABOUT TO BE DONE

561
00:28:11,131 --> 00:28:13,365
WITH THESE WOMEN, PLEASE.

562
00:28:13,367 --> 00:28:13,698
>> NO, NO, NO.

563
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:14,066
PLEASE JUST GIVE US ONE MORE

564
00:28:14,068 --> 00:28:18,737
CHANCE.

565
00:28:18,739 --> 00:28:20,338
>> LOOK.

566
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:21,406
HERE, IT IS A DRAWING.

567
00:28:21,408 --> 00:28:22,974
>> OKAY, WHAT IS THAT?

568
00:28:22,976 --> 00:28:25,077
>> IT'S YOU IN JAIL FOR BEING A

569
00:28:25,079 --> 00:28:27,179
WHORE.

570
00:28:27,181 --> 00:28:27,746
>> ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

571
00:28:27,748 --> 00:28:31,416
ENOUGH OF THIS NONSENSE.

572
00:28:31,418 --> 00:28:34,019
LADIES, YOU'RE FIRED.

573
00:28:34,021 --> 00:28:35,087
LET ME SEE THOSE LETTERS.

574
00:28:35,089 --> 00:28:37,222
>> THIS IS ONE THAT SAYS HOW THE

575
00:28:37,224 --> 00:28:38,790
PUBLIC REALLY FEELS ABOUT YOU.

576
00:28:38,792 --> 00:28:40,358
>> OKAY.

577
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:44,396
>> MARILYN, YOU ARE A GENIUS AND

578
00:28:44,398 --> 00:28:46,198
ICON AND DANCE YOUR HEART OUT.

579
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:49,334
>> OH, DADDY, THAT'S EXACTLY

580
00:28:49,336 --> 00:28:52,304
WHAT I NEEDED TO HEAR.

581
00:28:52,306 --> 00:28:54,372
MAYBE LETTERS REALLY ARE A

582
00:28:54,374 --> 00:28:55,836
GIRL'S BEST FRIEND.

583
00:28:56,838 --> 00:28:57,238
>> DID IT REALLY SAY THAT?
>> WHO KNOWS, I CAN'T READ.

584
00:29:28,216 --> 00:29:28,367
>>> HEY, I'M HERE FOR THE HEAD

585
00:29:28,369 --> 00:29:29,363
SHOTS.

586
00:29:29,365 --> 00:29:30,391
ARE YOU THE PHOTOGRAPHER?

587
00:29:30,393 --> 00:29:30,905
>> NO, I JUST LIKE STANDING NEXT

588
00:29:30,907 --> 00:29:36,143
TO THE CAMERAS.

589
00:29:36,145 --> 00:29:38,231
I'M KIDDING.

590
00:29:38,233 --> 00:29:38,585
I'M FUNNY.

591
00:29:38,587 --> 00:29:39,902
SIT OVER THERE AND WE'LL GET

592
00:29:39,904 --> 00:29:40,384
STARTED.

593
00:29:40,385 --> 00:29:45,493
>> SO I BROUGHT IN A COUPLE OF

594
00:29:45,495 --> 00:29:47,003
DIFFERENT LOOKS.

595
00:29:47,005 --> 00:29:48,544
NOTHING CRAZY.

596
00:29:48,546 --> 00:29:49,059
>> GRANDPA, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

597
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:49,765
>> YOU FORGOT YOUR FEDORA IN THE

598
00:29:49,767 --> 00:29:50,568
CAR.

599
00:29:50,570 --> 00:29:51,243
AND I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT NEED IT

600
00:29:51,245 --> 00:29:51,597
FOR YOUR LITTLE ACTING PHOTOS.

601
00:29:51,599 --> 00:29:53,107
>> THEY'RE CALLED HEADSHOTS,

602
00:29:53,109 --> 00:29:53,717
GRANDPA.

603
00:29:53,719 --> 00:29:54,135
I'M SORRY ABOUT HIM.

604
00:29:54,137 --> 00:29:55,678
>> I SEE I'VE INTERRUPTED.

605
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:58,183
MY APOLOGIES.

606
00:29:58,185 --> 00:30:00,207
I'LL SHOVE OFF.

607
00:30:00,209 --> 00:30:01,236
>> WAIT.

608
00:30:01,238 --> 00:30:08,272
I DON'T MEAN TO BE WEIRD.

609
00:30:08,274 --> 00:30:15,662
BUT THERE'S SOMETHING VERY

610
00:30:15,664 --> 00:30:15,919
SPECIAL ABOUT YOU.

611
00:30:15,921 --> 00:30:16,273
>> WHO, ME?

612
00:30:16,275 --> 00:30:19,679
NO.

613
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:22,121
>> YES.

614
00:30:22,122 --> 00:30:22,763
YOU MUST LET ME TAKE MY PHOTO.

615
00:30:22,765 --> 00:30:24,016
>> I HAVE NEVER HAD MY PICTURE

616
00:30:24,017 --> 00:30:26,489
TAKEN BEFORE.

617
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:30,570
>> WHAT ABOUT ME?

618
00:30:30,572 --> 00:30:42,555
>> YOU CAN MOVE YOUR HUGE ASS.

619
00:30:42,557 --> 00:30:44,643
>> PLEASE, SIR, STAND OVER

620
00:30:44,645 --> 00:30:49,206
THERE.

621
00:30:49,208 --> 00:30:50,619
YOUR AUDITION CAN WAIT.

622
00:30:50,621 --> 00:30:56,403
SHOW ME BROODING.

623
00:30:56,404 --> 00:30:59,487
YES, YES.

624
00:30:59,489 --> 00:31:00,482
NOW, GET YOUR SMILE ON.

625
00:31:00,484 --> 00:31:01,993
YES.

626
00:31:01,995 --> 00:31:08,226
NOW, BITE THAT LIP AND POP THAT

627
00:31:08,228 --> 00:31:09,094
HIP.

628
00:31:09,096 --> 00:31:11,760
COME ON.

629
00:31:11,762 --> 00:31:13,270
YES, SIR!

630
00:31:13,272 --> 00:31:14,780
NOW, HOW ABOUT WE DO A SILLY

631
00:31:14,782 --> 00:31:15,873
ONE.

632
00:31:15,875 --> 00:31:18,572
UH-HUH, YES.

633
00:31:18,574 --> 00:31:20,500
THAT IS THE FUNNIEST THING I

634
00:31:20,502 --> 00:31:22,781
HAVE EVER SEEN IN ANY LIFE AND I

635

HE TELLS THE PITCHER TO RELAX,

1099
00:52:57,416 --> 00:53:00,851
AND THEN HE BRINGS JESUS INTO

1100
00:53:00,853 --> 00:53:02,185
IT.

1101
00:53:02,187 --> 00:53:04,655
AND ONCE HE GETS TO BATTING,

1102

COLIN, IT IS ALL HIPS.

1103

WHITE GUYS ARE SO BORING.

1111

>> DON'T DO THAT, COLIN.

1118
00:53:29,515 --> 00:53:30,180
I DON'T LIKE THAT, BUT YES.

1119
00:53:30,182 --> 00:53:31,081
IT'S VERY DIFFERENT.

1120
00:53:31,083 --> 00:53:32,149
WHEN LATIN GUYS ARE TALKING

1121
00:53:32,151 --> 00:53:33,784
AFTER A GAME, IF THEY DO GET A

1122
00:53:33,786 --> 00:53:35,319
SENTENCE OFF IN ENGLISH, IT IS

1123
00:53:35,321 --> 00:53:36,386
NEVER ABOUT THE GAME.

1124
00:53:36,388 --> 00:53:37,955
THE REPORTER IS LIKE, "WHAT WAS

1125

1127
00:53:48,801 --> 00:53:50,367

DOESN'T DO BLOOD OATHS, AND SO I

1184

BASICALLY CUT INTO MY HAND LIKE

1185

A GASH.

1199
