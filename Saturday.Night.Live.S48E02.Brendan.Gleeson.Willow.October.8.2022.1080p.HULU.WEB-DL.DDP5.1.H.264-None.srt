1
00:00:00,684 --> 00:00:03,602
>>> HELLO, AMERICA.

2
00:00:06,977 --> 00:00:12,383
HAVE YOU NOTICED THAT EVERYONE
AROUND YOU IS ANGRY AND CRAZY?

3
00:00:12,383 --> 00:00:16,331
PEOPLE ARE FLIPPING OUT AT
TARGET, STABBING IS BACK, 

4
00:00:16,401 --> 00:00:22,180
AND
THE ONLY THING TO CHEER US UP IS
WATCHING A SEXY SHOW ABOUT
JEFFREY DAHMER.

5
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:25,998
WE ARE LIVING ON THE EDGE, AND
TONIGHT, I'M HERE TO PUSH US OVER 

6
00:00:25,998 --> 00:00:31,231
AS WE PLAY "SO YOU THINK
YOU WON'T SNAP."

7
00:00:32,421 --> 00:00:37,932
THAT'S RIGHT.
I'M YOUR HOST, MORGAN FREEGIRL.

8
00:00:37,932 --> 00:00:42,386
TONIGHT WE FOUND THE ONLY PEOPLE
IN AMERICA WHO HAVE NOT YET
SNAPPED.

9
00:00:42,386 --> 00:00:47,471
LET'S MEET 'EM.
IT'S HEATHER, KAYLA, DALE, AND
HENRY.

10
00:00:50,378 --> 00:00:53,515
THE GAME IS SIMPLE.
I'LL READ REAL STORIES FROM THE NEWS

11
00:00:53,515 --> 00:00:56,244
 AND IF YOU KEEP YOUR COOL,
YOU'LL WIN BIG MONEY.

12
00:00:56,244 --> 00:00:59,384
ALL RIGHT, HEATHER, YOU'RE UP
FIRST IN THE HOT SPOT.

13
00:01:00,818 --> 00:01:06,113
HEATHER, YOU ARE A MUSIC
PROFESSOR AND WHITE YOGA TEACHER

14
00:01:06,113 --> 00:01:07,669
IN BURLINGTON, VERMONT.

15
00:01:07,669 --> 00:01:12,107
>> YES, I'M JUST KIND OF A CHILL
PERSON, SO I PROMISE YOU'RE NOT
GONNA GET ME.

16
00:01:12,107 --> 00:01:13,262
>> WE'LL SEE ABOUT THAT.

17
00:01:13,262 --> 00:01:16,943
READ YOU
SOME HEADLINES.
TO TELL IF YOU'VE HIT YOUR
BREAKING POINT, 

18
00:01:16,943 --> 00:01:21,109
YOU HAVE IN
FRONT OF YOU A "TODAY SHOW"
SIZED GLASS OF WINE.

19
00:01:21,109 --> 00:01:25,779
>> OH, YEAH, I'M NOT GONNA DRINK
THAT.
I'VE BEEN SOBER FOR 15 YEARS.

20
00:01:25,779 --> 00:01:29,141
>> LOVE THAT CONFIDENCE.
LET'S PLAY.

21
00:01:29,141 --> 00:01:31,077
LET'S START WITH UKRAINE.

22
00:01:31,077 --> 00:01:35,103
>> A MASSIVE BRIDGE EXPLOSION
TODAY CUT OFF THE RUSSIAN SUPPLY
CHAIN.

23
00:01:35,103 --> 00:01:38,802
>> I SAW THAT.
HOPEFULLY IT BRINGS THIS WAR ONE
STEP CLOSER TO AN END.

24
00:01:38,802 --> 00:01:43,035
>> RIGHT, BECAUSE ON THURSDAY,
BIDEN SAID WE WERE CLOSER TO
NUCLEAR ARMAGEDDON

25
00:01:43,035 --> 00:01:45,131
 THAN WE'VE
BEEN IN 60 YEARS.

26
00:01:45,131 --> 00:01:48,208
>> DON'T KNOW WHERE TO PUT THAT
IN MY BRAIN, BUT I LOVE BIDEN.

27
00:01:48,208 --> 00:01:50,768
>> TOTALLY.
ME, TOO.
DO YOU KNOW HOW OLD HE IS?

28
00:01:50,768 --> 00:01:56,803
DID YOU KNOW THAT WHEN JOE BIDEN
WAS BORN, WE DIDN'T HAVE
HIGHWAYS?

29
00:01:56,803 --> 00:01:58,965
>> THAT -- THAT'S A FUN FACT.

30
00:01:58,965 --> 00:02:02,003
>> AND JOE BIDEN WAS 53-YEARS-OLD

31
00:02:02,003 --> 00:02:05,159
 WHEN HE GOT HIS
FIRST HOME COMPUTER.

32
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:08,698
>> WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?
>> I'M NOT DOING ANYTHING.

33
00:02:08,698 --> 00:02:12,263
YOU NEED A SIP OF THAT WINE?
>> NO.
I'M TOTALLY GOOD.

34
00:02:12,263 --> 00:02:14,645
>> WELL, YOUR NEXT ITEM IS A
VIDEO CLUE.

35
00:02:14,645 --> 00:02:18,708
PLEASE ENJOY THIS CLIP OF BIDEN
TALKING ABOUT HIS MENTAL ACUITY.

36
00:02:18,708 --> 00:02:21,787
>> HOW WOULD YOU SAY YOUR MENTAL
FOCUS IS?

37
00:02:21,787 --> 00:02:24,001
>> OH, IT IS FOCUSED.

38
00:02:24,412 --> 00:02:28,501
I THINK -- I THINK IT'S -- I --
I HAVEN'T -- LOOK.

39
00:02:30,359 --> 00:02:33,009
>> OH.
AND THAT'S A SNAP.

40
00:02:33,009 --> 00:02:45,697
>> MM, MAMA MISSED YOU.

41
00:02:45,699 --> 00:02:46,298
>> UP NEXT IS KAYLA.

42
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:48,834
KAYLA, GET IN THE HOT SPOT.

00:02:53,574 --> 00:02:55,174
PICKLEBALL CURIOUS.

46
00:02:55,176 --> 00:02:55,908
>> YEAH, YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.

47
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:57,809
I'M BLESSED WITH FOUR BEAUTIFUL

48
00:02:57,811 --> 00:03:02,548
CHILDREN AND I DON'T HAVE TIME

49
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:05,684
TO WORRY ABOUT ANYTHING ELSE.

50
00:03:05,686 --> 00:03:06,385
>> MM-HM, RIGHT.

>> HELLO.

57
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:14,126
OH, GOSH, NO.

00:03:14,128 --> 00:03:14,793
I -- I DON'T HIT PEOPLE.

59
00:03:14,795 --> 00:03:15,661
>> THEY GET HIT ALL THE TIME,

60
00:03:15,663 --> 00:03:17,262
THERE MUST BE A GOOD REASON.

61
00:03:17,264 --> 00:03:17,796
LET'S PLAY.

62
00:03:17,798 --> 00:03:19,898

>> DO YOU WATCH THE NEWS?

69
00:03:40,154 --> 00:03:47,626
>> NEVER.

70
00:03:47,628 --> 00:03:49,995

71
00:03:49,997 --> 00:03:52,297
>> UM, I GUESS SO.

72
00:03:52,299 --> 00:03:53,932
DID YOU KNOW THATF 0% OF KIDS

00:03:53,934 --> 00:03:56,134
WHEN THEY GROW UP SAY THEY WANT

74
00:03:56,136 --> 00:04:01,640
TO BE INFLUENCER.

75
00:04:01,642 --> 00:04:05,944

â™ª

167
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:24,122
BARNEY WAS THE BANJO PLAYER WITH

00:10:24,124 --> 00:10:26,758
THE DUBLINERS.

169
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:30,428
AND THEY WERE TRAVELING TO A

00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:35,734
VERY HOT COUNTRY ONE TIME, AND

171
00:10:35,736 --> 00:10:37,836
BARNEY WAS TOLD IT WOULD BE

104 DEGREES IN THE SHADE.

173
00:10:39,439 --> 00:10:40,171
AND HE SAYS, "I'LL TELL YOU ONE

174
00:10:40,173 --> 00:10:44,175
THING, BARNEY SAYS.

175
00:10:44,177 --> 00:10:46,811
"I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE NEAR THE"

176
00:10:46,813 --> 00:10:47,879

â™ª

178
00:10:51,018 --> 00:10:54,152

DEGREES OF MUSICALITY.

180

HIGH NOTES COULD SHATTER GLASS.

183
00:11:01,561 --> 00:11:02,594
ALL THE KIDS WERE TERRIFIED

184
00:11:02,596 --> 00:11:07,866
SHE'D BURST INTO SONG AT ANY

185
00:11:07,868 --> 00:11:13,638
MOMENT, ESPECIALLY THE KIDS WITH

186
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,306
GLASSES.

187
00:11:15,308 --> 00:11:18,543
WHEREAS MY FATHER DIDN'T HAVE A

188
00:11:18,545 --> 00:11:22,914
NOTE, WELL, HE DID HAVE ONE

189
00:11:22,916 --> 00:11:29,187
NOTE, BUT HE HAD HIS OWN WAY OF

190
00:11:29,189 --> 00:11:31,189
GOING ON AND WHEN HE SANG IN OUR

191
00:11:31,191 --> 00:11:36,961
SONG, MY SON FERGUS ASKED HIM,

192
00:11:36,963 --> 00:11:38,029
"GRANDDAD, WHY DO YOU COMB YOUR"

193
00:11:38,031 --> 00:11:39,097
HAIR BEFORE YOU GET INTO BED?"

194
00:11:39,099 --> 00:11:40,665
AND DAD SAID, "BECAUSE YOU NEVER

195
00:11:40,667 --> 00:11:41,299
KNOW WHO YOU MIGHT MEET IN YOUR

196
00:11:41,301 --> 00:11:42,267

197
00:11:42,269 --> 00:11:43,301
HOW ABOUT THAT, WEIRD AND

00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:15,500
AND WE HOPE HE IS SOMEWHERE ON

333
00:17:15,502 --> 00:17:16,267
HIS BACK WITH A BULLET IN HIS

334
00:17:16,269 --> 00:17:17,301
BRAIN AND BELLY.

335
00:17:17,303 --> 00:17:18,369
>> WHOA.

336
00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:19,036
ISN'T THAT A LITTLE BIT EXTREME?

337
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:20,471
>> WELL, NO.

338
00:17:20,473 --> 00:17:20,972
WELL, YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER,

339
00:17:20,974 --> 00:17:21,672
LAURA, THE SIDE CHICK WAS A FOOD

340
00:17:21,674 --> 00:17:23,074
BABY.

341
00:17:23,076 --> 00:17:25,209
>> YEAH, YES, YOU KEEP SAYING

342
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:26,778
THAT.

343
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:28,880
WHAT IS A FOOD BABY?

344
00:17:28,882 --> 00:17:32,617
>> "FOOD BABY" IS A SPINOFF.

345
00:17:32,619 --> 00:17:34,452
FOOD SHOW ON THE TRY GUY'S

346
00:17:34,454 --> 00:17:34,819
CHANNEL.

347
00:17:34,821 --> 00:17:37,588
YOU IDIOT.

348
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:38,656
>> OKAY.

349
00:17:38,658 --> 00:17:39,724
STOP.

350
00:17:39,726 --> 00:17:40,391
TURNING BACK TO THE NEWS,

351
00:17:40,393 --> 00:17:41,259
VIOLENCE CONTINUES AS IRAN IS ON

352
00:17:41,261 --> 00:17:41,826
THE CUSP OF A NEW CULTURAL

353
00:17:41,828 --> 00:17:43,394
REVOLUTION.

354
00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:44,462
>> CUT BACK TO US.

355
00:17:44,464 --> 00:17:46,564
>> NO!

356
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:47,598
>> DUE TO THE TRAUMA WE ARE

357
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,200
FACING, THE EDITORS ARE WORKING

358
00:17:49,202 --> 00:17:55,373
AROUND THE CLOCK TO REMOVE ANY

359
00:17:55,375 --> 00:18:00,478
TRACE OF NED FROM PAST TRY GUYS'

360
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,546
CONCERTS.

361
00:18:01,548 --> 00:18:02,180
THIS IS THE BATTLE OF OUR LIVES.

362
00:18:02,182 --> 00:18:02,747
>> WHOA!

363
00:18:02,749 --> 00:18:03,648
JAY-Z CHEATED ON BEYONCE.

364
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:04,182
IT'S GOING TO BE OKAY.

365
00:18:04,184 --> 00:18:04,816
>> CUT BACK TO US.

366
00:18:04,818 --> 00:18:06,284
>> LOOK AT ME.

367
00:18:06,286 --> 00:18:08,386
THIS IS THE FACE OF GRIEF.

368
00:18:08,388 --> 00:18:09,454
>> NO, IT'S NOT.

369
00:18:09,456 --> 00:18:11,022
>> IT IS THOUGH.

370
00:18:11,024 --> 00:18:13,157
AND JUST FYI, WE ARE STILL GOING

371
00:18:13,159 --> 00:18:15,760
TO BE RELEASING SOME PREVIOUSLY

372
00:18:15,762 --> 00:18:17,895
FILMED BRANDED VIDEOS.

373
00:18:17,897 --> 00:18:18,963
SO, YEAH, YOU MIGHT SEE NED IN

374
00:18:18,965 --> 00:18:37,849
"SWEET GREEN PRESENTS: THE TRY"

375
00:18:37,851 --> 00:18:40,485
GUYS TRY SALAD WITH BUGS ON

376
00:18:40,487 --> 00:18:42,987
TOP."

377
00:18:42,989 --> 00:18:48,125
>> AND IT WILL STILL BE AMAZE

378
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:50,194
BALLS, BUT IT WILL STILL BE SAD

379
00:18:50,196 --> 00:18:54,332
BALLS, BECAUSE WE ARE ALL STILL

380
00:18:54,334 --> 00:18:54,999
PROCESSING THIS HORRIFIC AND

381
00:18:55,001 --> 00:18:55,933
PROBABLY RACIST TRAGEDY.

382
00:18:55,935 --> 00:18:56,467
>> CAN YOU CUT BACK TO ME,

383
00:18:56,469 --> 00:18:57,502
PLEASE?

384
00:18:57,504 --> 00:18:58,236
>> NO.

385
00:18:58,238 --> 00:18:59,070
>> HEAR THIS, AMERICA.

386
00:18:59,072 --> 00:19:00,137
WE WILL NEVER STOP BRINGING YOU

387
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:01,205
THE SAME TRY GUYS ADVENTURE.

388
00:19:01,207 --> 00:19:01,906
>> I WILL STILL BE TRYING SUPER

389
00:19:01,908 --> 00:19:03,307
WEIRD CAMBODIAN FOOD.

390
00:19:03,309 --> 00:19:05,409
AND ZACH WILL STILL BE TRYING

391
00:19:05,411 --> 00:19:06,978
SUPER WEIRD MALAYSIAN FOOD.

392
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:16,654
AND KEITH IS STILL GOING TO TRY

393
00:19:16,656 --> 00:19:17,955
WEARING A THONG FOR A WEEK,

394
00:19:17,957 --> 00:19:19,090
BECAUSE IT'S OUR DUTY.

395
00:19:19,092 --> 00:19:20,157
>> OKAY.

396
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:22,460
THIS IS TOO TRAUMATIC.

397
00:19:22,462 --> 00:19:23,427
THIS INTERVIEW IS OVER.

398
00:19:23,429 --> 00:19:25,429
>> THANK YOU FOR YOUR BRAVERY

399
00:19:25,431 --> 00:19:25,730
TRY GUYS.

400
00:19:25,732 --> 00:19:27,164
KNOW THAT THE COUNTRY IS WITH

401
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:30,501
YOU.

402
00:19:30,503 --> 00:19:38,075
WHAT IS TODAY'S DATE?

403
00:19:38,077 --> 00:19:44,849
WHATEVER IT IS, NEVER FORGET.

404
00:19:44,851 --> 00:19:46,384
FOR CNN, I'M COLLIN O'DIRTY.

405
00:19:46,386 --> 00:19:47,985
>> AND THEY ARE MILLIONAIRES.

406
00:19:47,987 --> 00:19:48,519
OKAY, I'M GOING TO GO SEE WHAT

407
00:19:48,521 --> 00:19:51,656
KETAMINE IS ALL ABOUT.

408
00:19:51,658 --> 00:19:52,723
THIS HAS BEEN CNN.

409
00:19:52,725 --> 00:19:54,325
GOODNIGHT.

410
00:19:54,327 --> 00:19:55,359
>>> BEING A NEW CAST MEMBER AT

411
00:19:55,361 --> 00:19:56,027
SNL, YOU GET A LOT OF ADVICE.

412
00:19:56,029 --> 00:19:57,495
>> ADVICE FROM FRIENDS, FAMILY,

413
00:19:57,497 --> 00:19:59,030
VETERAN CAST MEMBERS, EVEN

414
00:19:59,032 --> 00:20:00,631
LORNE.

415
00:20:00,633 --> 00:20:02,199
LORNE TOLD ME, "DON'T DO TOO

416
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:04,302
MUCH IN THE FIRST COUPLE SHOWS."

417
00:20:04,304 --> 00:20:05,369
>> LET THE AUDIENCE DISCOVER YOU

418
00:20:05,371 --> 00:20:06,971
AND GET TO KNOW YOU.

419
00:20:06,973 --> 00:20:08,539
>> UNTIL WE FIND WRITERS WHO

420
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:10,141
UNDERSTAND MY VOICE, MY ODD

421
00:20:10,143 --> 00:20:11,709
HAUNTING VOICE.

422
00:20:11,711 --> 00:20:12,743
>> HE TOLD ME TO JUST BE ME.

423
00:20:12,745 --> 00:20:13,411
TO TRUST MY INSTINCTS FROM

424
00:20:13,413 --> 00:20:17,081
STAND-UP.

425
00:20:17,083 --> 00:20:19,250
AND I KNOW HOW TO HANDLE AN

426
00:20:19,252 --> 00:20:20,284
AUDIENCE.

427
00:20:20,286 --> 00:20:21,352
HE WAS REALLY SWEET ABOUT IT.

428
00:20:21,354 --> 00:20:22,386
>> SEE?

429
00:20:22,388 --> 00:20:23,421
THIS IS ALL KIND OF CRAZY TO

430
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:24,522
HEAR, BECAUSE ON DAY ONE, LORNE

431
00:20:24,524 --> 00:20:25,556
TOLD ME WHEN HE OFF, AND HE

432
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:26,090
SAID, "MOLLY, THERE IS ONLY ONE

433
00:20:26,092 --> 00:20:28,726
REASON YOU ARE HERE.

434
00:20:28,728 --> 00:20:30,294
I NEED YOU TO KILL

435
00:20:30,296 --> 00:20:31,896
VLADIMIR PUTIN."

436
00:20:31,898 --> 00:20:32,530
HE ASKED YOU IF HE'S GONE.

437
00:20:32,532 --> 00:20:33,464
HE SAID, "DON'T WORRY, THE

438
00:20:33,466 --> 00:20:34,532
SERIAL NUMBERS HAVE BEEN

439
00:20:34,534 --> 00:20:35,566
SCRATCHED OFF.

440
00:20:35,568 --> 00:20:37,134
HE'LL NEVER TRACE IT BACK TO

441
00:20:37,136 --> 00:20:38,202
US."

442
00:20:38,204 --> 00:20:39,236
I'M LIKE, "US?"

443
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:40,304
>> I, FOR ONE, HAD SAID, "DON'T

444
00:20:40,306 --> 00:20:41,339
EXPECT TO SEE IN A BUNCH OF

445
00:20:41,341 --> 00:20:42,440
SKETCHES RIGHT AWAY."

446
00:20:42,442 --> 00:20:44,008
>> LORNE SAID TO REALLY TAKE MY

447
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:45,576
TIME.

448
00:20:45,578 --> 00:20:46,644
YOU KNOW, MAYBE, DON'T EVEN

449
00:20:46,646 --> 00:20:47,712
WRITE A SKETCH UNTIL CHRISTMAS.

450
00:20:47,714 --> 00:20:48,746
>> MY UNCLE SAID, "MAKE SURE TO

451
00:20:48,748 --> 00:20:50,348
GET AN ACCOUNTANT, AND WATCH

452
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:51,882
HIM, BECAUSE SOMEBODY WILL TAKE

453
00:20:51,884 --> 00:20:52,950
MY MONEY."

454
00:20:52,952 --> 00:20:54,518
>> I TOLD LORNE, "PLEASE DON'T

455
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:55,586
MAKE ME DO THIS.

456
00:20:55,588 --> 00:20:57,188
I WOULD RATHER BE ON SKETCHES,

457
00:20:57,190 --> 00:20:58,222
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT I CAME HERE

458
00:20:58,224 --> 00:20:59,256
TO DO."

459
00:20:59,258 --> 00:20:59,957
AND LORNE GOES, "EVERYBODY HAS

460
00:20:59,959 --> 00:21:01,392
DONE SKETCHES, BUT YOU KNOW WHAT

461
00:21:01,394 --> 00:21:02,960
WILL FERRELL AND ADAM SANDLER

462
00:21:02,962 --> 00:21:05,062
NEVER DID?

463
00:21:05,064 --> 00:21:07,698
KILL VLADIMIR PUTIN."

464
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:09,300
I TOLD HIM TO WAIT.

465
00:21:09,302 --> 00:21:10,868
I TOLD MY AGENT ABOUT THIS.

466
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:12,436
>> DAVID SPADE CALLED AND SAID,

467
00:21:12,438 --> 00:21:13,471
"CONGRATS ON YOUR FIRST UPDATE"

468
00:21:13,473 --> 00:21:14,538
FEATURE.

469
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:15,606
WE'RE BOTH FROM ARIZONA, SO THAT

470
00:21:15,608 --> 00:21:17,174
WAS REALLY COOL."

471
00:21:17,176 --> 00:21:18,743
>> I GOT FLOWERS FROM

472
00:21:18,745 --> 00:21:19,477
KRISTIN WIIG.

473
00:21:19,479 --> 00:21:20,878
I WAS LIKE, "THAT'S INSANE."

474
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:21,912
I CAN'T EVEN BELIEVE SHE KNOWS

475
00:21:21,914 --> 00:21:22,980
WHO I AM.

476
00:21:22,982 --> 00:21:24,048
>> I GET A CALL IN THE MIDDLE OF

477
00:21:24,050 --> 00:21:25,616
THE NIGHT.

478
00:21:25,618 --> 00:21:27,184
IT'S FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE,

479
00:21:27,186 --> 00:21:28,786
JOHN KERRY.

480
00:21:28,788 --> 00:21:29,820
AND HE SAID, "COME ON, LORNE.

481
00:21:29,822 --> 00:21:30,488
CAN YOU BE HERE IN 10 MINUTES

482
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:31,956
WITH YOUR BAGS PACKED?"

483
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:33,524
I'M THINKING, "PACKED WITH

484
00:21:33,526 --> 00:21:34,258
WHAT?"

485
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:35,059
>> I FEEL LIKE HE WAS PART OF A

486
00:21:35,061 --> 00:21:35,626
LARGER FAMILY, ALL OF A SUDDEN.

487
00:21:35,628 --> 00:21:37,194
I SAW MY PHOTO ON THE SAME WALL

488
00:21:37,196 --> 00:21:45,569
WITH EDDIE MURPHY.

489
00:21:45,571 --> 00:21:47,204
I MEAN, "THAT'S CRAZY."

490
00:21:47,206 --> 00:21:47,972
>> YOU KNOW, I SAW MY PHOTO ON

491
00:21:47,974 --> 00:21:56,047
THAT I WAS RECOGNIZED AND THEY

492
00:21:56,049 --> 00:21:58,616
THOUGHT THAT I WAS KEENAN, BUT

493
00:21:58,618 --> 00:22:08,125
THAT IS OKAY.

494
00:22:08,127 --> 00:22:08,859
>> AND LORNE SAID, WE CAN GET

495
00:22:08,861 --> 00:22:15,933
YOU TO RUSSIA, BUT I CAN'T

496
00:22:15,935 --> 00:22:19,070
GUARANTEE THAT WE WILL GET YOU

497
00:22:19,072 --> 00:22:22,573
OUT.

498
00:22:22,575 --> 00:22:23,307
AND SO, I GET TO LORNE'S AT 4:00

499
00:22:23,309 --> 00:22:24,175
A.M.

500
00:22:24,177 --> 00:22:24,709
IT'S JOHN KERRY, BILL GATES AND,

501
00:22:24,711 --> 00:22:25,443
WEIRDLY, KELLY RIPA.

502
00:22:25,445 --> 00:22:26,277
WE'RE INSIDE.

503
00:22:26,279 --> 00:22:26,811
WE CAN GET YOU TO RUSSIA, BUT WE

504
00:22:26,813 --> 00:22:27,845
CAN'T PROMISE WE CAN GET YOU

505
00:22:27,847 --> 00:22:28,479
OUT.

506
00:22:28,481 --> 00:22:29,146
AND I REALLY WANT TO BE ON

507
00:22:29,148 --> 00:22:29,980
SNL, SO I'M JUST, LIKE,

508
00:22:29,982 --> 00:22:31,015
NODDING MY HEAD AND SAYING,

509
00:22:31,017 --> 00:22:31,716
ANYTHING YOU SAY, SIR.

510
00:22:31,718 --> 00:22:32,416
AND KELLY RIPA IS REALLY SWEET.

511
00:22:32,418 --> 00:22:33,150
SHE LIKE, "WHATEVER HAPPENS,

512
00:22:33,152 --> 00:22:33,884
JUST KNOW YOUR FAMILY WILL BE

513
00:22:33,886 --> 00:22:34,685
TAKEN CARE OF."

514
00:22:34,687 --> 00:22:35,786
BUT LIKE, IS KELLY RIPA GOING TO

515
00:22:35,788 --> 00:22:36,520
PAY FOR MY FUNERAL?

516
00:22:36,522 --> 00:22:37,354
>> I'M WORKING ON A SKETCH THIS

517
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:38,089
WEEK AND LORNE SAID, "DON'T RUSH

518
00:22:38,091 --> 00:22:38,823
INTO IT."

519
00:22:38,825 --> 00:22:39,423
HE SAID, "EVEN IF I'M NOT IN ANY

520
00:22:39,425 --> 00:22:40,491
SKETCHES FOR THE FIRST YEAR OR

521
00:22:40,493 --> 00:22:41,559
TWO, THAT'S FINE."

522
00:22:41,561 --> 00:22:42,593
>> I TOLD LORNE I WAS WORKING ON

523
00:22:42,595 --> 00:22:43,327
A SKETCH FOR ME AND MOLLY, AND

524
00:22:43,329 --> 00:22:44,195
HE JUST, KIND OF, STARED OFF

525
00:22:44,197 --> 00:22:44,895
INTO THE DISTANCE AND SAID, "IF

526
00:22:44,897 --> 00:22:45,796
WE EVER SEE MOLLY AGAIN."

527
00:22:45,798 --> 00:22:46,831
I KNEW THAT AIN'T FEEL RIGHT.

528
00:22:46,833 --> 00:22:47,498
>> I'M THROWN IN BACK OF A VAN.

529
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:48,432
I HEAR A MILITARY GUY SCREAM,

530
00:22:48,434 --> 00:22:49,967
"IF SHE GETS CAPTURED OVER"

531
00:22:49,969 --> 00:22:51,035
THERE, SHE IS ON HER OWN."

532
00:22:51,037 --> 00:22:52,603
AND I WANT HER TO BE LIKE --

533
00:22:52,605 --> 00:22:54,205
IT'S ACTUALLY LIKE -- IT'S

534
00:22:54,207 --> 00:22:55,272
ACTUALLY "THEY," NOT "SHE."

535
00:22:55,274 --> 00:22:55,773
BUT IT DIDN'T SEEM LIKE THE

536
00:22:55,775 --> 00:22:56,841
RIGHT MOMENT FOR THE PRONOUN

537
00:22:56,843 --> 00:22:57,575
TALK.

538
00:22:57,577 --> 00:22:58,209
THEN WE DRIVED STRAIGHT THROUGH

539
00:22:58,211 --> 00:22:58,943
THE NIGHT AT, LIKE, 150 MILES AN

540
00:22:58,945 --> 00:22:59,443
HOUR AND I'M LIKE, "WHOA!"

541
00:22:59,445 --> 00:23:00,511
THE HOURS AT "SNL" IS REALLY ARE

542
00:23:00,513 --> 00:23:01,178
CRAZY.

543
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:02,113
>> WE WERE TEXTING EACH OTHER

544
00:23:02,115 --> 00:23:03,681
THE FIRST WEEK LIKE, "GOOD

545
00:23:03,683 --> 00:23:04,415
LUCK," "BREAK A LEG," AND THEN

546
00:23:04,417 --> 00:23:05,249
MOLLY TEXTED, "I HAVE TO KILL."

547
00:23:05,251 --> 00:23:06,317
IT'S LIKE, "DON'T PUT THAT KIND

548
00:23:06,319 --> 00:23:07,351
OF PRESSURE ON YOURSELF."

549
00:23:07,353 --> 00:23:08,419
>> YOU REALIZE THERE'S THIS

550
00:23:08,421 --> 00:23:09,453
WHOLE COMMUNITY OF PEOPLE WHO

551
00:23:09,455 --> 00:23:10,087
WORK AT "SNL," AND WE'RE ALL

552
00:23:10,089 --> 00:23:11,622
JUST HERE TO DO COMEDY.

553
00:23:11,624 --> 00:23:13,724
EXCEPT, APPARENTLY, MOLLY.

554
00:23:13,726 --> 00:23:14,759
>> THE VAN SCREECHES TO A HALT.

555
00:23:14,761 --> 00:23:15,426
THEY THROW ME ON TO A DOCK, RIP

556
00:23:15,428 --> 00:23:16,360
OFF THE HOOD.

557
00:23:16,362 --> 00:23:17,094
AND I'M LIKE, "IS THIS THE

558
00:23:17,096 --> 00:23:17,928
PANAMA CANAL?"

559
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:18,996
THEN A GUY WALKS UP IN A SAFARI

560
00:23:18,998 --> 00:23:20,598
HAT AND A WHITE MUSTACHE.

561
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:22,133
I SWEAR TO GOD IT WAS LORNE'S

562
00:23:22,135 --> 00:23:23,734
TWIN BROTHER, AND HE SAYS --

563
00:23:25,838 --> 00:23:32,143
THEN THEY DRIVE AWAY, AND I GO

564
00:23:32,145 --> 00:23:34,779
TO CALL AN UBER, BUT I CAN'T USE

565
00:23:34,781 --> 00:23:36,380
MY PHONE BECAUSE THEY BURNT MY

566
00:23:36,382 --> 00:23:37,414
BETTER BREAD PHONE.

567
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:38,482
>> AT THE END OF THE DAY, YOU'LL

568
00:23:38,484 --> 00:23:39,150
HAVE TO REALIZE YOU'RE GOING TO

569
00:23:39,152 --> 00:23:40,584
HAVE GOOD SHOWS AND BAD SHOWS.

570
00:23:40,586 --> 00:23:41,652
LAST WEEK, I GOT ON WEEKEND

571
00:23:41,654 --> 00:23:42,686
UPDATE.

572
00:23:42,688 --> 00:23:43,420
THIS WEEK, I GET TO PLAY

573
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:44,255
KANYE WEST.

574
00:23:44,257 --> 00:23:45,322
YOU JUST HAVE TO ENJOY THE RIDE.

575
00:23:45,324 --> 00:23:46,357
>> EXACTLY.

576
00:23:46,359 --> 00:23:47,458
DON'T TRY TO WRITE OR PITCH

577
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:48,092
IDEAS.

578
00:23:48,094 --> 00:23:49,026
DON'T EXPECT ANYONE TO PUT YOU

579
00:23:49,028 --> 00:23:51,662
IN SKETCHES OR GIVE YOU A

580
00:23:51,664 --> 00:23:53,764
COMPUTER OR AN OFFICE OR AN I.D.

581
00:23:53,766 --> 00:23:55,299
SO YOU GET INSIDE THE BUILDING.

582
00:23:55,301 --> 00:23:56,367
YOU JUST GOT TO CHILL AT HOME.

583
00:23:56,369 --> 00:23:56,967
>> AND BE MORE EXCITING THAT

584
00:23:56,969 --> 00:23:58,502
THERE ARE FOUR NEW CAST MEMBERS

585
00:23:58,504 --> 00:23:59,537
SO WE CAN EXPERIENCE IT

586
00:23:59,539 --> 00:24:00,604
TOGETHER.

587
00:24:00,606 --> 00:24:01,639
>> LONG STORY SHORT, MOST OF MY

588
00:24:01,641 --> 00:24:10,414
FIRST WEEK AT "SNL" IS ABOUT

589
00:24:10,416 --> 00:24:12,149
CONNECTING BUSES THROUGH

590
00:24:12,151 --> 00:24:14,652
CENTRAL AMERICA.

591
00:24:14,654 --> 00:24:17,454
BUT I MADE IT RIGHT BEFORE THE

592
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:19,990
SHOW OPEN, AND JUST BEFORE THE

593
00:24:19,992 --> 00:24:23,194
COLD OPEN STARTED, LORNE CAME UP

594
00:24:23,196 --> 00:24:24,195
TO ME AND SAID, "MOLLY, I'M

595
00:24:24,197 --> 00:24:24,895
REALLY PROUD OF YOU."

596
00:24:24,897 --> 00:24:25,796
AND JUST SO YOU KNOW, WE NEVER

597
00:24:25,798 --> 00:24:26,831
MAKE CAST MEMBERS KILL PEOPLE.

598
00:24:26,833 --> 00:24:27,898
I THOUGHT THAT WAS REALLY COOL.

599
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:31,068
>> WAIT, SO I DIDN'T HAVE TO

600
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:32,136
KILL OSAMA BIN LADEN?

601
00:24:32,138 --> 00:24:34,772
NOW I GOT TO PAY FOR IT.

602
00:24:34,774 --> 00:24:35,806
>>> THIS FALL, NETFLIX RELEASED

603
00:24:35,808 --> 00:24:42,146
BLONDE.

604
00:24:42,148 --> 00:24:46,951
AN NC-17 NO HOLES BARRED LOOK AT

605
00:24:46,953 --> 00:24:47,985
THE LIFE OF MARILYN MONROE,

606
00:24:47,987 --> 00:24:48,686
HERE'S A PREVIEW.

607
00:24:48,688 --> 00:24:49,119
>> MARILYN, WHAT'S THE HOLD UP?

608
00:24:49,121 --> 00:24:50,621
WE'RE ABOUT TO SHOOT THE BIG

609
00:24:50,623 --> 00:24:51,155
DANCE NUMBER.

610
00:24:51,157 --> 00:24:51,856
>> I'M JUST GOING TO MESS IT UP,

611
00:24:51,858 --> 00:24:53,290
DADDY.

612
00:24:53,292 --> 00:24:54,024
IT'S LIKE I'M A SLAVE TO THIS

613
00:24:54,026 --> 00:24:54,859
MARILYN MONROE.

614
00:24:54,861 --> 00:25:02,032
>> OH, DON'T SAY THAT, MARILYN.

615
00:25:02,034 --> 00:25:07,204
EVERYBODY LOVES YOU.

616
00:25:07,206 --> 00:25:09,807
AND TO CHEER YOU UP, I BROUGHT

617
00:25:09,809 --> 00:25:10,674
IN DEVIN AND AGNES FROM THE

618
00:25:10,676 --> 00:25:16,747
STUDIO TO READ YOU ALL OF YOUR

619
00:25:16,749 --> 00:25:17,248
ADORING FAN MAIL.

620
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:18,282
COME ON IN, LADIES.

621
00:25:18,284 --> 00:25:19,350
>> WOW.

622
00:25:19,352 --> 00:25:20,417
OH, WOW, IS THAT A PAINTING OR A

623
00:25:20,419 --> 00:25:21,118
LADY?

624
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:21,986
>> LOOK, YOU'RE MARILYN MONROE.

625
00:25:21,988 --> 00:25:22,686
YOU'RE EVEN PRETTIER THAN THE

626
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:24,088
PICTURE.

627
00:25:24,090 --> 00:25:24,822
>> YOU SURE DO HAVE A LOT OF

628
00:25:24,824 --> 00:25:25,656
FANS, MISS MONROE.

629
00:25:25,658 --> 00:25:26,724
THIS IS THE MOST MAIL WE'VE EVER

630
00:25:26,726 --> 00:25:27,758
SEEN.

631
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:28,459
>> WE HAD TO CARRY IT ALL UP

632
00:25:28,461 --> 00:25:28,826
AWAY FROM THE BASEMENT, BUT IT'S

633
00:25:28,828 --> 00:25:29,360
WORTH IT IF IT MAKES YOU FEEL

634
00:25:29,362 --> 00:25:30,928
BETTER.

635
00:25:30,930 --> 00:25:31,996
>> SEE MARILYN?

636
00:25:31,998 --> 00:25:32,496
THEY LOVE YOU.

637
00:25:32,498 --> 00:25:33,130
>> AND I DO NEED THE LOVE,

638
00:25:33,132 --> 00:25:34,098
DADDY.

639
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:34,832
LET'S HEAR THOSE LETTERS.

640
00:25:34,834 --> 00:25:35,699
>> HERE'S -- HERE'S ONE.

641
00:25:35,701 --> 00:25:36,233
MARILYN, YOU ARE THE SWEETHEART

642
00:25:36,235 --> 00:25:36,734
OF THIS AND ANY OTHER MONTH.

643
00:25:36,736 --> 00:25:37,835
>> AW.

644
00:25:37,837 --> 00:25:38,535
>> AW.

645
00:25:38,537 --> 00:25:39,069
EVEN FEBRUARY?

646
00:25:39,071 --> 00:25:39,904
OH, SHUCKS, I'M BEGINNING TO

647
00:25:39,906 --> 00:25:40,537
FEEL BETTER ALREADY.

648
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:41,505
>> HERE'S ANOTHER.

649
00:25:41,507 --> 00:25:43,073
MARILYN, I WISH I WAS YOU.

650
00:25:43,075 --> 00:25:46,277
>> AH.

651
00:25:46,279 --> 00:25:47,311
>> MY TURN.

652
00:25:47,313 --> 00:25:49,413
MARILYN, YOU ARE A WHORE, BLONDE

653
00:25:49,415 --> 00:25:55,286
AND FRAIL.

654
00:25:55,288 --> 00:25:57,922
NO ONE WILL EVER LOVE YOU, YOU

655
00:25:57,924 --> 00:25:59,623
DISGUSTING TRAMP.

656
00:25:59,625 --> 00:26:01,825
YOU ARE POISONING OUR CHILDREN,

657
00:26:01,827 --> 00:26:03,894
YOU TRAMP.

658
00:26:03,896 --> 00:26:04,161
>> THAT SEEMS A LITTLE MEAN.

659
00:26:04,163 --> 00:26:05,362
>> THAT ONE MUST HAVE BEEN MIXED

660
00:26:05,364 --> 00:26:07,197
UP.

661
00:26:07,199 --> 00:26:09,300
>> THIS IS ANOTHER ONE.

662
00:26:09,302 --> 00:26:10,367
MARILYN, YOU ARE A SWEETHEART

663
00:26:10,369 --> 00:26:13,304
AND YOUR SMILE IS A SWEETHEART,

664
00:26:13,306 --> 00:26:14,505
TOO.

665
00:26:14,507 --> 00:26:16,040
YOU ARE A SWEETHEART SWEETHEART,

666
00:26:16,042 --> 00:26:19,710
LOVE LOUISVILLE.

667
00:26:19,712 --> 00:26:21,512

BUTT, AND I'D LIKE TO KICK IT.

00:26:42,268 --> 00:26:43,367
NOT A FAN.

BAIL?

680
00:26:48,808 --> 00:26:49,673
>> WELL, IT'S HARD, MS. MONROE,

681
00:26:49,675 --> 00:26:50,407
BECAUSE SOME OF THEM START NICE

682
00:26:50,409 --> 00:26:51,241

683
00:26:51,243 --> 00:26:51,976

00:26:55,581 --> 00:26:56,547
>> SURE.

690
00:26:56,549 --> 00:26:57,081
HERE'S ONE MISS MONROE.

691
00:26:57,083 --> 00:26:58,115

692
00:26:58,117 --> 00:26:59,683

00:26:59,685 --> 00:27:00,417
>> YOU READ THE WHOLE THING?

694
00:27:00,419 --> 00:27:00,751
>> YEAH.

>> MARILYN, YOU ARE A WHORE.

700
00:27:07,593 --> 00:27:09,193
NOT A FAN.

701
00:27:09,195 --> 00:27:10,761
>> HERE'S AN IDEA.

702
00:27:10,763 --> 00:27:11,295
MAYBE IF IT SAYS "WHORE," WE

703
00:27:11,297 --> 00:27:13,397
SKIP THAT AND SAY "FLOWER"

704
00:27:13,399 --> 00:27:14,431
INSTEAD.

705
00:27:14,433 --> 00:27:17,601
>> OH, YOU GOT IT.

706
00:27:17,603 --> 00:27:18,635
MARILYN, YOU WERE BORN A FLOWER,

707
00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:21,805
AND YOU WILL DIE A FLOWER.

708
00:27:21,807 --> 00:27:23,407
>> YOU ARE A DIRTY FLOWER, AND

709
00:27:23,409 --> 00:27:24,441
YOUR MOTHER WAS A FLOWER, TOO.

710
00:27:24,443 --> 00:27:26,043
>> OH, OH, I FOUND A GOOD ONE.

711
00:27:26,045 --> 00:27:29,179
I REALLY LOOK UP TO YOU.

712
00:27:29,181 --> 00:27:32,349
>> AH.

713
00:27:32,351 --> 00:27:34,451
>> I'M ALSO A FLOWER.

714
00:27:34,453 --> 00:27:39,556
NOT A FAN.

715
00:27:39,558 --> 00:27:42,192
>> OKAY.

716
00:27:42,194 --> 00:27:43,227
EVERYONE HATES MARILYN MONROE.

717
00:27:43,229 --> 00:27:44,294
I SHOULD HAVE STAYED NORMA JEAN.

718
00:27:44,296 --> 00:27:45,863
>> WELL, THIS IS ADDRESSED TO

719
00:27:45,865 --> 00:27:46,563
NORMA JEAN.

720
00:27:46,565 --> 00:27:47,264
>> NORMA JEAN?!

721
00:27:47,266 --> 00:27:47,965
ONLY IN THE WORLD, PROUDLY --

722
00:27:47,967 --> 00:27:49,033
ONLY ONE PERSON IN THE WORLD

723
00:27:49,035 --> 00:27:49,533
CALLS ME THAT.

724
00:27:49,535 --> 00:27:51,635
>> NORMA JEAN, IT'S YOUR DAD.

725
00:27:51,637 --> 00:27:52,302
NOT A FAN.

726
00:27:52,304 --> 00:27:53,203
>> OKAY.

727
00:27:53,205 --> 00:27:54,805
>> IF HE'S NOT A FAN OF --

728
00:27:54,807 --> 00:27:56,373
MAYBE HE'S BEEN --

729
00:27:56,375 --> 00:27:57,474
>> WELL, MAYBE WE DON'T READ ANY

730
00:27:57,476 --> 00:27:58,208
THAT SAY "NOT A FAN AT ALL."

731
00:27:58,210 --> 00:28:00,077
IS THAT OKAY?

732
00:28:00,079 --> 00:28:01,178
ALSO, I'M SORRY, WHO ARE YOU TWO

733
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:02,713

734

>> WELL, WE'RE YOUR FAN MAIL

735
00:28:03,783 --> 00:28:06,917
READERS.

736
00:28:06,919 --> 00:28:09,053
>> AND THAT'S, LIKE, THE WHOLE

737
00:28:09,055 --> 00:28:09,753
JOB?

738
00:28:09,755 --> 00:28:10,621
>> WELL, WE ARE ALSO VEERING FOR

739
00:28:10,623 --> 00:28:12,189
SOME OF THE GAY STARS, BUT WE

740
00:28:12,191 --> 00:28:16,093
CAN'T SAY WHICH, ROCK HUDSON.

741
00:28:16,095 --> 00:28:17,161
>> OKAY.

742
00:28:17,163 --> 00:28:19,129
I THINK I'M ABOUT TO BE DONE

743
00:28:19,131 --> 00:28:21,365
WITH THESE WOMEN, PLEASE.

744
00:28:21,367 --> 00:28:21,698
>> NO, NO, NO.

745
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:22,066
PLEASE JUST GIVE US ONE MORE

746
00:28:22,068 --> 00:28:26,737
CHANCE.

747
00:28:26,739 --> 00:28:28,338
>> LOOK.

748
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:29,406
HERE, IT IS A DRAWING.

749
00:28:29,408 --> 00:28:30,974
>> OKAY, WHAT IS THAT?

750
00:28:30,976 --> 00:28:33,077
>> IT'S YOU IN JAIL FOR BEING A

751
00:28:33,079 --> 00:28:35,179
WHORE.

752
00:28:35,181 --> 00:28:35,746
>> ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

753
00:28:35,748 --> 00:28:39,416
ENOUGH OF THIS NONSENSE.

754
00:28:39,418 --> 00:28:42,019
LADIES, YOU'RE FIRED.

755
00:28:42,021 --> 00:28:43,087
LET ME SEE THOSE LETTERS.

756
00:28:43,089 --> 00:28:45,222
>> THIS IS ONE THAT SAYS HOW THE

757
00:28:45,224 --> 00:28:46,790
PUBLIC REALLY FEELS ABOUT YOU.

758
00:28:46,792 --> 00:28:48,358
>> OKAY.

759
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:52,396
>> MARILYN, YOU ARE A GENIUS AND

760
00:28:52,398 --> 00:28:54,198
ICON AND DANCE YOUR HEART OUT.

761
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:57,334
>> OH, DADDY, THAT'S EXACTLY

762
00:28:57,336 --> 00:29:00,304
WHAT I NEEDED TO HEAR.

763
00:29:00,306 --> 00:29:02,372
MAYBE LETTERS REALLY ARE A

764
00:29:02,374 --> 00:29:32,836
GIRL'S BEST FRIEND.

765
00:29:32,838 --> 00:29:33,704
>> DID IT REALLY SAY THAT?

766
00:29:33,706 --> 00:29:34,238
>> WHO KNOWS, I CAN'T READ.

767
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:36,373
>>> HEY, I'M HERE FOR THE HEAD

768
00:29:36,375 --> 00:29:37,407
SHOTS.

769
00:29:37,409 --> 00:29:38,475
ARE YOU THE PHOTOGRAPHER?

770
00:29:38,477 --> 00:29:39,009
>> NO, I JUST LIKE STANDING NEXT

771
00:29:39,011 --> 00:29:44,448
TO THE CAMERAS.

772
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:46,617
I'M KIDDING.

773
00:29:46,619 --> 00:29:46,984
I'M FUNNY.

774
00:29:46,986 --> 00:29:48,352
SIT OVER THERE AND WE'LL GET

775
00:29:48,354 --> 00:29:48,852
STARTED.

776
00:29:48,854 --> 00:29:54,158
>> SO I BROUGHT IN A COUPLE OF

777
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,726
DIFFERENT LOOKS.

778
00:29:55,728 --> 00:29:57,327
NOTHING CRAZY.

779
00:29:57,329 --> 00:29:57,861
>> GRANDPA, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

780
00:29:57,863 --> 00:29:58,595
>> YOU FORGOT YOUR FEDORA IN THE

781
00:29:58,597 --> 00:29:59,429
CAR.

782
00:29:59,431 --> 00:30:00,130
AND I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT NEED IT

783
00:30:00,132 --> 00:30:00,497
FOR YOUR LITTLE ACTING PHOTOS.

784
00:30:00,499 --> 00:30:02,065
>> THEY'RE CALLED HEADSHOTS,

785
00:30:02,067 --> 00:30:02,699
GRANDPA.

786
00:30:02,701 --> 00:30:03,133
I'M SORRY ABOUT HIM.

787
00:30:03,135 --> 00:30:04,735
>> I SEE I'VE INTERRUPTED.

788
00:30:04,737 --> 00:30:07,337
MY APOLOGIES.

789
00:30:07,339 --> 00:30:09,439
I'LL SHOVE OFF.

790
00:30:09,441 --> 00:30:10,507
>> WAIT.

791
00:30:10,509 --> 00:30:17,814
I DON'T MEAN TO BE WEIRD.

792
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:25,489
BUT THERE'S SOMETHING VERY

793
00:30:25,491 --> 00:30:25,756
SPECIAL ABOUT YOU.

794
00:30:25,758 --> 00:30:26,123
>> WHO, ME?

795
00:30:26,125 --> 00:30:29,660
NO.

796
00:30:29,662 --> 00:30:32,196
>> YES.

797
00:30:32,198 --> 00:30:32,863
YOU MUST LET ME TAKE MY PHOTO.

798
00:30:32,865 --> 00:30:34,164
>> I HAVE NEVER HAD MY PICTURE

799
00:30:34,166 --> 00:30:36,733
TAKEN BEFORE.

800
00:30:36,735 --> 00:30:40,971
>> WHAT ABOUT ME?

801
00:30:40,973 --> 00:30:53,417
>> YOU CAN MOVE YOUR HUGE ASS.

802
00:30:53,419 --> 00:30:55,586
>> PLEASE, SIR, STAND OVER

803
00:30:55,588 --> 00:31:00,324
THERE.

804
00:31:00,326 --> 00:31:01,792
YOUR AUDITION CAN WAIT.

805
00:31:01,794 --> 00:31:07,798
SHOW ME BROODING.

806
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:11,001
YES, YES.

807
00:31:11,003 --> 00:31:12,035
NOW, GET YOUR SMILE ON.

808
00:31:12,037 --> 00:31:13,604
YES.

809
00:31:13,606 --> 00:31:20,077
NOW, BITE THAT LIP AND POP THAT

810
00:31:20,079 --> 00:31:20,978
HIP.

811
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:23,747
COME ON.

812
00:31:23,749 --> 00:31:25,315
YES, SIR!

813
00:31:25,317 --> 00:31:26,883
NOW, HOW ABOUT WE DO A SILLY

814
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:28,018

UH-HUH, YES.

816
00:31:30,823 --> 00:31:32,823
THAT IS THE FUNNIEST THING I

817
00:31:32,825 --> 00:31:35,192
HAVE EVER SEEN IN ANY LIFE AND I

818
00:31:35,194 --> 00:31:37,461
HAVE SEEN "SEINFELD."

819
00:31:37,463 --> 00:31:39,129
>> IS IT MY TURN YET?

820
00:31:39,131 --> 00:31:39,429
>> IT SEEMS LIKE YOU ARE JEALOUS

821
00:31:39,431 --> 00:31:41,999
THAT YOUR BOYFRIEND IS THE REAL

822
00:31:42,001 --> 00:31:45,769
STAR.

823
00:31:45,771 --> 00:31:58,715
>> THAT IS MY GRANDPA.

824
00:31:58,717 --> 00:31:59,750
>> PLEASE, SIR.

825
00:31:59,752 --> 00:32:00,284
ONE MORE.

826
00:32:00,286 --> 00:32:01,318
OKAY.

827
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:02,919

828
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:03,654

YES!

830
00:32:09,762 --> 00:32:10,794
DEAR GOD, THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT

831
00:32:10,796 --> 00:32:12,396
SKIING LOOKS LIKE.

832
00:32:12,398 --> 00:32:13,430
NOW, HOW ABOUT CUTE SHY BOY?

833
00:32:13,432 --> 00:32:13,930
OH, WHY SO SHY, CUTE BOY?

00:32:16,068 --> 00:32:19,236
YES, MORE.

842
00:32:35,621 --> 00:32:37,721
DOING?

843
00:32:37,723 --> 00:32:41,425
>> HOW ABOUT YOU WRITE A BOOK

844
00:32:41,427 --> 00:32:42,993
ABOUT THE FIRST TIME I SAW YOUR

845

THE WORLD NEEDS TO SEE WHAT I

864
00:33:12,958 --> 00:33:14,191
VERY WEIRD, BUT THERE IS

865
00:33:14,193 --> 00:33:14,458
SOMETHING SPECIAL ABOUT YOU.

RIGHT?

1416
00:52:08,860 --> 00:52:09,425
HE JUST HIT THE 62nd HOME RUN,

1417
00:52:09,427 --> 00:52:10,392
SET THE A.L. RECORD.

1418

1419
00:52:11,128 --> 00:52:11,961
IMPRESSIVE, COLIN, BUT THERE

1420
00:52:11,963 --> 00:52:12,695
JUST WASN'T ENOUGH EMOTION FOR

1421
00:52:12,697 --> 00:52:14,096
ME.

1422
00:52:14,098 --> 00:52:14,830
HE HITS THE 62nd HOME RUN, PUTS

1423
00:52:14,832 --> 00:52:15,664
THE BAT DOWN GENTLY, AND THEN

1424
00:52:15,666 --> 00:52:16,732
IT'S A COUPLE OF HIGH FIVES AND

1425
00:52:16,734 --> 00:52:17,766
STRAIGHT TO THE DUGOUT.

1426
00:52:17,768 --> 00:52:18,500
WHEN A DOMINICAN HITS A HOMERUN,

1427
00:52:18,502 --> 00:52:19,368
COLIN, HE THROWS THE BAT TO A

1428
00:52:19,370 --> 00:52:20,402
DIFFERENT DIMENSION, AND THEN HE

1429
00:52:20,404 --> 00:52:21,470
GETS TO HOME PLATE, AND HE

1430
00:52:21,472 --> 00:52:22,137
THANKS EVERYONE HE'S EVER

1431
00:52:22,139 --> 00:52:23,572
ENCOUNTERED.

1432
00:52:23,574 --> 00:52:24,607
HE GETS TO HOME PLATE, HE'S

1433
00:52:24,609 --> 00:52:26,175
LIKE, "THANK YOU TO MY MOTHER,

1436
00:52:28,312 --> 00:52:29,912
EVERYTHING CHANGES WHEN THEY

1437
00:52:29,914 --> 00:52:30,646
BRING OUT THE DOMINICAN GUY.

1438
00:52:30,648 --> 00:52:31,480

1439
00:52:31,482 --> 00:52:33,616

SUDDEN.

1442
00:52:37,288 --> 00:52:41,991
NOW, THIS GUY NAMED JEFF IS

1443
00:52:41,993 --> 00:52:46,228
LIKE, "AND NOW, COMING TO THE

1444
00:52:46,230 --> 00:52:49,398
PLATE FROM SANTO DOMINGO,

1445
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:50,432
STARLING MARTE.

1446
00:52:50,434 --> 00:52:55,204
CUE THE MERENGUE MUSIC.

1447
00:52:55,206 --> 00:52:56,772
EVEN THE WHITE GUYS IN THE CROWD

1448
00:52:56,774 --> 00:52:57,806
ARE LIKE --

1449
00:52:57,808 --> 00:52:59,408
PLAYER GETS THERE, HE COMES OUT

1450
00:52:59,410 --> 00:53:00,142
LIKE WITH A CHAIN OUT OF

1451
00:53:00,144 --> 00:53:00,843
NOWHERE.

1452
00:53:00,845 --> 00:53:05,414
HE TELLS THE PITCHER TO RELAX,

1453
00:53:05,416 --> 00:53:08,851
AND THEN HE BRINGS JESUS INTO

1454
00:53:08,853 --> 00:53:10,185
IT.

1455
00:53:10,187 --> 00:53:12,655
AND ONCE HE GETS TO BATTING,

1456
00:53:12,657 --> 00:53:15,624
COLIN, IT IS ALL HIPS.

1457
00:53:15,626 --> 00:53:15,891
DO YOU FEEL IT, COLIN?

1458
00:53:15,893 --> 00:53:18,961
>> I AM PRETTY SURE I AM FEELING

1459
00:53:18,963 --> 00:53:23,866
IT.

1460
00:53:23,868 --> 00:53:24,867
>> AND BY THE TIME HE IS DONE

1461
00:53:24,869 --> 00:53:25,935
BATTING, THE CROWD IS PREGNANT.

1462
00:53:25,937 --> 00:53:26,969
AND THE POST-GAME INTERVIEWS ARE

1463
00:53:26,971 --> 00:53:27,670
DIFFERENT, COLIN.

1464
00:53:27,672 --> 00:53:29,071
WHITE GUYS ARE SO BORING.

1465
00:53:29,073 --> 00:53:29,738
THEY ARE ALWAYS TALKING ABOUT

1466
00:53:29,740 --> 00:53:31,206
THE GAME.

1467
00:53:31,208 --> 00:53:32,241
IT'S ALWAYS LIKE, "WE HAD A

1468
00:53:32,243 --> 00:53:33,309
PLAN, AND WE EXECUTED IT."

1469
00:53:33,311 --> 00:53:34,877
>> BUT I BET LATIN GUYS DO IT

1470
00:53:34,879 --> 00:53:35,945
DIFFERENT?

1471
00:53:35,947 --> 00:53:37,513
>> DON'T DO THAT, COLIN.

1472
00:53:37,515 --> 00:53:38,180
I DON'T LIKE THAT, BUT YES.

1473
00:53:38,182 --> 00:53:39,081
IT'S VERY DIFFERENT.

1474
00:53:39,083 --> 00:53:40,149
WHEN LATIN GUYS ARE TALKING

1475
00:53:40,151 --> 00:53:41,784
AFTER A GAME, IF THEY DO GET A

1476
00:53:41,786 --> 00:53:43,319
SENTENCE OFF IN ENGLISH, IT IS

1477
00:53:43,321 --> 00:53:44,386
NEVER ABOUT THE GAME.

1478
00:53:44,388 --> 00:53:45,955
THE REPORTER IS LIKE, "WHAT WAS

1479
00:53:45,957 --> 00:53:48,090
GOING THROUGH YOUR HEAD ON THAT

1480
00:53:48,092 --> 00:53:56,799
3- 2 SLIDER."

1481
00:53:56,801 --> 00:53:58,367
AND THEN RAMON IS LIKE, "MAN, I

1482
00:53:58,369 --> 00:53:59,802
LOVE MIAMI, MAN.

1483

FOOD IS AMAZING.

1485
00:54:06,043 --> 00:54:06,408
AND COLIN, THEY ONLY SPEAK

1486
00:54:06,410 --> 00:54:09,044
ENGLISH UNTIL THEY LOSE

1487
00:54:09,046 --> 00:54:12,181
PATIENCE.

IN A BLOOD OATH AS MY PEOPLE

1514
00:55:34,565 --> 00:55:38,133

>> WHAT NEWS FROM OUR SCOUTS?

1523
00:55:59,590 --> 00:56:02,658
>> THE GOLFENS WILL BE IN OUR

1524

00:56:07,865 --> 00:56:10,432
RANKS.

>> THOUSANDS AND I AM STILL

1529
00:56:12,636 --> 00:56:14,703
BLEEDING FROM THAT BLOOD OATH.

00:56:14,705 --> 00:56:15,370
>> IS YOUR PALM STILL BLEEDING?

1531
00:56:15,372 --> 00:56:16,138
>> NO, THE BLOOD OATH REQUIRES

1532
00:56:16,140 --> 00:56:18,107
BUT A SCRATCH.

1533
00:56:18,109 --> 00:56:18,373
>> OKAY.

1534
00:56:18,375 --> 00:56:21,009
SO YOU WENT SUPER LIGHT?

1535
00:56:21,011 --> 00:56:23,145
AH.

1536
00:56:23,147 --> 00:56:25,047
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT, AND MY TRIBE

1537
00:56:25,049 --> 00:56:27,049
DOESN'T DO BLOOD OATHS, AND SO I

1538
00:56:27,051 --> 00:56:29,017
BASICALLY CUT INTO MY HAND LIKE

1539
00:56:29,019 --> 00:56:30,052
I WAS CUTTING INTO STEAK.

1540
00:56:30,054 --> 00:56:32,354
>> OH, THAT WAS UNWISE OF YOU.

1541
00:56:32,356 --> 00:56:33,856
>> I KNOW.

1542
00:56:33,858 --> 00:56:34,156
LIKE I SAID, I HAVE NEVER DONE A

1543
00:56:34,158 --> 00:56:45,567
BLOOD OATH BEFORE, BUT IT IS

1544
00:56:45,569 --> 00:56:47,169
FINE.

1545
00:56:47,171 --> 00:56:48,737
I WILL DEAL WITH IT.

1546
00:56:48,739 --> 00:56:50,339
>> OKAY, SO YOUR CUT WILL NOT BE

1547
00:56:50,341 --> 00:56:51,006
THE FOCUS ANYMORE?

1548
00:56:51,008 --> 00:56:51,907
WE'RE FINISHED WITH YOUR CUT?

1549
00:56:51,909 --> 00:56:52,641
>> FIRST, I DON'T LOVE THE

1550
00:56:52,643 --> 00:56:53,475
ATTITUDE.

1551
00:56:53,477 --> 00:56:55,077
AND SECOND, IT'S NOT A CUT, IT'S

1552
00:56:55,079 --> 00:56:56,145
A GASH.

1553
00:56:56,147 --> 00:56:56,879
BUT I'M DONE WITH IT.

1554
00:56:56,881 --> 00:56:58,780
>> IF I MAY.

1555
00:56:58,782 --> 00:56:59,815
GOLFEN HORDE WILL SURELY CROSS

1556
00:56:59,817 --> 00:57:00,916
THE RIVER HERE.

1557
00:57:00,918 --> 00:57:02,484
THIS IS WHERE WE MAKE OUR

1558
00:57:02,486 --> 00:57:03,552
STANCE.

1559
00:57:03,554 --> 00:57:09,558

00:57:18,335 --> 00:57:19,201
>> WHAT THE HELL, DUDE?

1565
00:57:19,203 --> 00:57:20,736

1566
00:57:20,738 --> 00:57:22,337
DO THAT.

1567
00:57:22,339 --> 00:57:22,871

GO, COVER IT.

1570
00:57:26,544 --> 00:57:28,110
>> I'M SORRY.

1572
00:57:28,679 --> 00:57:29,278

LIGAMENTS OUT.

1591
00:58:03,380 --> 00:58:05,113
WHY WOULD YOU SLICE YOUR HAND SO

1592
00:58:05,115 --> 00:58:17,059
DEEP?

1593
00:58:17,061 --> 00:58:20,362

BLOOD OATHS IN MY TRIBE.

1595

THE GIRL THINKS I'M A LOSER.

1603
00:58:33,010 --> 00:58:34,610

AND I HAVE A BADGE.

1611

01:02:28,812 --> 01:02:29,678
THE LIMIT.

1671
01:02:29,680 --> 01:02:30,412
>> THAT'S GOOD, THAT'S REALLY

1672
01:02:30,414 --> 01:02:31,213
GOOD.

1673
01:02:31,215 --> 01:02:32,814
I WAS THINKING DENVER, GATEWAY

1674
01:02:32,816 --> 01:02:34,950
TO THE ROCKIES.

1675
01:02:34,952 --> 01:02:35,650
>> ALL RIGHT, NOW WE'RE TALKING.

1676
01:02:35,652 --> 01:02:36,518
>> WHO EVEN CARES.

1677
01:02:36,520 --> 01:02:38,086
>> JANINE, YOU HAVE HAD A BAD

1678
01:02:38,088 --> 01:02:40,188
ATTITUDE ALL MORNING.

1679
01:02:40,190 --> 01:02:42,858
WHAT IS THE PROBLEM?

1680
01:02:42,860 --> 01:02:45,493
>> NOTHING, NOTHING, IT'S JUST

1681
01:02:45,495 --> 01:02:46,228
THAT NOBODY NOTICED.

1682
01:02:46,230 --> 01:02:52,834
>> NOTICED WHAT?

1683
01:02:52,836 --> 01:02:54,936
>> NOBODY NOTICED I GOT MY EYES

1684
01:02:54,938 --> 01:02:57,072
REPLACED.

1685
01:02:57,074 --> 01:02:58,607
>> OH, YES, JANINE, WE

1686
01:02:58,609 --> 01:02:59,341
DEFINITELY NOTICED.

1687
01:02:59,343 --> 01:03:01,810
WE HAD AN EMERGENCY MEETING

1688
01:03:01,812 --> 01:03:02,844
ABOUT IT THE SECOND YOU WALKED

1689
01:03:02,846 --> 01:03:03,912
IN THE DOOR.

1690
01:03:03,914 --> 01:03:04,646
>> ULTIMATELY, WE DECIDED THAT

1691
01:03:04,648 --> 01:03:09,851
LEGALLY, IT WOULDN'T BE SAFEST

1692
01:03:09,853 --> 01:03:11,853
IF WE JUST DIDN'T PRETEND WE SAW

1693
01:03:11,855 --> 01:03:14,956
IT.

1694
01:03:14,958 --> 01:03:16,024
>> EXCEPT YOU BROUGHT IT UP.

1695
01:03:16,026 --> 01:03:18,660
WHY DID YOU DO THIS, JANINE?

1696
01:03:18,662 --> 01:03:20,762
>> THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

1697
01:03:20,764 --> 01:03:21,329
NOBODY IS TALKING ABOUT HOW

1698
01:03:21,331 --> 01:03:22,898
LOUANN GOT A HUGE FAKE RACK.

1699
01:03:22,900 --> 01:03:24,466
>> I LITERALLY DIDN'T.

1700
01:03:24,468 --> 01:03:25,133
>> OH, MY GOD, GOOD FOR YOU.

1701
01:03:25,135 --> 01:03:26,568
>> JANINE, JANINE, I CAN'T HELP

1702
01:03:26,570 --> 01:03:28,136
BUT FEELING THAT YOU MADE A

1703
01:03:28,138 --> 01:03:29,204
GRAVE MISTAKE.

1704
01:03:29,206 --> 01:03:29,938
>> OH, MY GOD, NO, IT IS TOTALLY

1705
01:03:29,940 --> 01:03:30,772
REVERSIBLE.

1706
01:03:30,774 --> 01:03:33,408
ALL I HAVE TO DO IS KEEP MY OLD

1707
01:03:33,410 --> 01:03:35,010
EYES REFRIGERATED.

1708
01:03:35,012 --> 01:03:39,247
OH, MY GOD, NO.

1709
01:03:39,249 --> 01:03:40,248
OH, MY GOD, I FORGOT TO KEEP MY

1710
01:03:40,250 --> 01:03:42,918
OLD EYES REFRIGERATED.

1711
01:03:42,920 --> 01:03:43,952
OH, MY GOD.

1712
01:03:43,954 --> 01:03:49,925
THEY ARE IN MY POCKET.

1713
01:03:49,927 --> 01:03:51,660
OH, MY GOD, THEY ARE STILL GOOD,

1714
01:03:51,662 --> 01:03:53,161
RIGHT?

1715
01:03:53,163 --> 01:03:55,063
CAN YOU SMELL THEM AND TELL ME

1716
01:03:55,065 --> 01:04:00,468
THEY ARE STILL GOOD, RIGHT?

1717
01:04:00,470 --> 01:04:02,037
ARE YOU SMELLING THEM?

1718
01:04:02,039 --> 01:04:07,809
I CAN'T SEE YOUR GUYS' REACTION

1719
01:04:07,811 --> 01:04:08,777
AND TELL ME?

1720
01:04:08,779 --> 01:04:09,311
WHAT IS YOUR FACIAL REACTIONS?

1721
01:04:09,313 --> 01:04:10,912
>> WAIT, YOUR EYES ARE WORSE

1722
01:04:10,914 --> 01:04:11,546
NOW?

1723
01:04:11,548 --> 01:04:12,480
>> YES, 100%.

1724
01:04:12,482 --> 01:04:13,048
>> THEN WHY DID YOU DO IT?

1725
01:04:13,050 --> 01:04:14,049
>> TO IMPROVE MY APPEARANCE.

1726
01:04:14,051 --> 01:04:15,116
>> BUT IT LOOKS WORSE.

1727
01:04:15,118 --> 01:04:20,355
>> OH, MY GOD, NO.

1728
01:04:20,357 --> 01:04:22,724
>> HEY, EVERYBODY, SORRY I AM

1729
01:04:22,726 --> 01:04:26,461
LATE.

1730
01:04:26,463 --> 01:04:27,162
>> HEY, CHARLES, WHAT DO YOU

1731
01:04:27,164 --> 01:04:28,063
THINK OF MY NEW EYEBALLS?

1732
01:04:28,065 --> 01:04:29,664
>> AND I AM GOING STRAIGHT TO

1733
01:04:29,666 --> 01:04:30,365
CHURCH.

1734
01:04:30,367 --> 01:04:31,232
>> HEY, GUYS, SERIOUSLY, CAN WE

1735
01:04:31,234 --> 01:04:32,801
FOCUS UP AND JUST GET BACK TO

1736
01:04:32,803 --> 01:04:33,868
BUSINESS, OKAY.

1737
01:04:33,870 --> 01:04:34,402
>> OKAY.

1738
01:04:34,404 --> 01:04:37,038
>> HOW ABOUT THIS, DENVER, CITY

1739
01:04:37,040 --> 01:04:37,539
OF ANGELS.

1740
01:04:37,541 --> 01:04:38,606
THAT IS LOS ANGELES.

1741
01:04:38,608 --> 01:04:39,641
>> OH, MY GOD, NO.

1742
01:04:39,643 --> 01:04:44,012
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

1743
01:04:44,014 --> 01:04:47,115
>> YES, THAT IS FAMOUSLY

1744
01:04:47,117 --> 01:04:47,882
LOS ANGELES.

1745
01:04:47,884 --> 01:04:49,884
>> NO, DON'T BE MEAN TO ME, I

1746
01:04:49,886 --> 01:04:52,587
CAN'T CRY.

1747
01:04:52,589 --> 01:04:52,921
BECAUSE THE TEARS GO BACK INSIDE

1748
01:04:52,923 --> 01:04:54,189
OF MY HEAD AND THE BRAIN WILL

1749
01:04:54,191 --> 01:04:56,891
DROWN.

1750
01:04:56,893 --> 01:04:59,928
>> YOUR BRAIN WILL DROWN, WHAT

1751
01:04:59,930 --> 01:05:04,366
ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

1752
01:05:04,368 --> 01:05:06,167
>> YOU KNOW WHAT, YOU PEOPLE

1753
01:05:06,169 --> 01:05:06,501
SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF YOURSELVES.

1754
01:05:06,503 --> 01:05:20,415
TODAY, YOU PUT A WOMAN'S BODY ON

1755
01:05:20,417 --> 01:05:21,483
TRIAL.

1756
01:05:21,485 --> 01:05:23,084
>> YOU BROUGHT IT UP.

1757
01:05:23,086 --> 01:05:25,720
WHEN I CAME IN THIS MORNING WITH

1758
01:05:25,722 --> 01:05:26,755
A LOT OF GREAT PITCHES LIKE

1759
01:05:26,757 --> 01:05:27,789
DENVER, CITY OF ANGELS.

1760
01:05:27,791 --> 01:05:28,857
DENVER, KEEP AUSTIN WEIRD.

1761
01:05:28,859 --> 01:05:29,924
>> YOU KNOW WE CAN'T DO THAT.

1762
01:05:29,926 --> 01:05:33,595
>> I QUIT.

1763
01:05:33,597 --> 01:05:34,329
AND I'M LEAVING NOT IN DISGRACE,

1764
01:05:34,331 --> 01:05:36,231
BUT WITH DIGNITY, ELEGANCE AND

1765
01:05:36,233 --> 01:05:41,436
CLASS, AND I'M TAKING WITH ME,

1766
01:05:41,438 --> 01:05:42,771
MY PORTFOLIO.

1767
01:05:42,773 --> 01:05:44,806
>> OKAY.

1768
01:05:44,808 --> 01:05:45,840
THAT IS COFFEE CAKE.

1769
01:05:45,842 --> 01:05:48,209
>> AND OF COURSE, I WILL BE

1770
01:05:48,211 --> 01:05:52,447
TAKING MY JACKET.

1771
01:05:52,449 --> 01:05:54,916
>> AND WITH THAT, LADIES AND

1772
01:05:54,918 --> 01:05:56,718
GENTLEMEN, I BID YOU ALL ADO.

1773
01:05:56,720 --> 01:05:58,153
>> OH, ELLEN, I DIDN'T KNOW THAT

1774
01:05:58,155 --> 01:06:02,090
YOU WERE IN HERE.

1775
01:06:02,092 --> 01:06:04,826
YOU LOOK AMAZING.

1776
01:06:04,828 --> 01:06:07,328
YOU SEE HOW EASY THAT IS TO PAY

1777
01:06:07,330 --> 01:06:07,629
A COMPLIMENT TO A FRIEND.

1778
01:06:07,631 --> 01:06:09,097
>> JANINE, THAT IS NOT A HUMAN

1779
01:06:09,099 --> 01:06:12,233
BEING.

1780
01:06:12,235 --> 01:06:14,736
IT IS A WATER COOLER.

1781
01:06:14,738 --> 01:06:17,472
>> I WILL LEAVE YOU ALL WITH

1782
01:06:17,474 --> 01:06:19,174
THIS, LIFE COMES AT YOU PRETTY

1783
01:06:19,176 --> 01:06:21,709
FAST, AND IF YOU BLINK, YOU

1784
01:06:21,711 --> 01:06:27,949
MIGHT JUST MISS IT.

1785
01:06:27,951 --> 01:06:28,349
MEANWHILE, I'M NOT GOING TO MISS

1786
01:06:28,351 --> 01:06:31,419
A THING.

1787
01:06:33,890 --> 01:06:34,355
>> SO, DENVER, IF YOU BLINK

1788
01:06:34,357 --> 01:06:50,772
YOU'LL MISS IT.

1789
01:06:50,774 --> 01:07:00,849
