1
00:00:00,162 --> 00:00:04,298
>>> YOU'RE WATCHING NEW YORK 1,
NEW YORK'S NUMBER FIVE NEWS
STATION.

2
00:00:09,481 --> 00:00:11,712
>> HELLO.

3
00:00:12,611 --> 00:00:15,282
HELLO AND GOOD EVENING FROM NEW
YORK 1.

4
00:00:15,282 --> 00:00:16,454
YAMMER ROLL LOUIS,

5
00:00:16,454 --> 00:00:21,146
AND I AM NOW OFFICIALLY THE LEAST FAMOUS
PERSON TO BE IMPERSONATED ON
SNL.

6
00:00:21,146 --> 00:00:24,563
BUT TRUST ME, IT'S UNCANNY.

7
00:00:24,563 --> 00:00:28,163
WE'RE COMING TO YOU LIVE FOR
THIS THE THIRD, FINAL,

8
00:00:28,163 --> 00:00:31,378
AND
FICTIONAL NEW YORK CITY MAYORAL
DEBATE.

9
00:00:31,378 --> 00:00:35,493
TONIGHT'S EVENT IS SPONSORED BY
GRISTINI'S SUPERMARKET.

10
00:00:35,493 --> 00:00:38,544
SAY, WHERE DID YOU GET THAT WET
SANDWICH?

11
00:00:38,544 --> 00:00:40,715
WHY, GRISTITI'S, OF COURSE.

12
00:00:40,715 --> 00:00:42,709
AND BIKE LANES.

13
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:44,935
YOU WANT A NEW WAY TO DIE?

14
00:00:45,247 --> 00:00:47,912
STEP INTO A BIKE LANE.

15
00:00:47,912 --> 00:00:50,885
TONIGHT, WE'RE GOING TO HEAR
FROM TWO VIABLE CANDIDATES

16
00:00:50,885 --> 00:00:53,582
AND
ONE GOOD OLD-FASHIONED NEW YORK
NUT.

17
00:00:53,582 --> 00:00:58,210
FIRST UP, FORMER NEW YORK
GOVERNOR ANDREW CUOMO.

18
00:01:00,526 --> 00:01:03,652
>> HELLO, VOTERS.
YOU ALL KNOW ME.

19
00:01:03,652 --> 00:01:05,402
I GOT US THROUGH COVID, AND THEN

20
00:01:05,402 --> 00:01:09,040
YADA YADA YADA, HONK HONK,
SQUEEZE SQUEEZE.

21
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,777
ANYWAY, I'M BACK.

22
00:01:10,777 --> 00:01:14,246
I'M A BORN AND BRED NEW YORKER.
I LOVE IT HERE.

23
00:01:14,246 --> 00:01:17,364
I KNOW THIS CITY LIKE THE BACK
OF A WOMAN'S BACK,

24
00:01:17,364 --> 00:01:19,543
MAMMA MIA!

25
00:01:20,238 --> 00:01:25,281
>> NEXT WE HAVE THE DEMOCRATIC
NOMINEE, ZOHRAN MAMDANI.

26
00:01:27,121 --> 00:01:30,169
>> HELLO, EVERYONE.
I'M HAPPY TO BE HERE.

27
00:01:30,169 --> 00:01:34,619
AND I'M READY TO SPEND THE NEXT
HOUR HEARING MY OPPONENTS
PRONOUNCE MY NAME

28
00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:37,818
IN WAYS YOU
COULDN'T BEGIN TO IMAGINE.

29
00:01:37,818 --> 00:01:40,647
AND I KNOW SOME OF YOU ARE OUT
THERE SCARED

30
00:01:40,647 --> 00:01:43,417
OF THE IDEA OF A
YOUNG SOCIAL LIST MUSLIM MAYOR,

31
00:01:43,417 --> 00:01:45,027
SO ALLOW ME TO PUT YOU AT EASE --

32
00:01:45,027 --> 00:01:47,626
BY SMILING AFTER EVERY ANSWER

33
00:01:47,626 --> 00:01:51,253
IN A WAY THAT PHYSICALLY
HURTS MY FACE.

34
00:01:54,873 --> 00:01:56,514
>> ALL RIGHT.

35
00:01:56,514 --> 00:01:59,674
AND NOW LET'S DO A FUN ONE.

36
00:02:00,059 --> 00:02:04,125
THE REPUBLICAN NOMINEE, CURTIS
SLIWA.

37
00:02:04,682 --> 00:02:08,896
YES.
MR. SLIWA, YOUR OPENING
STATEMENT?

38
00:02:08,896 --> 00:02:12,696
>> I'M THRILLED TO BE HERE AND
NOT GETTING SHOT IN THE BACK

39
00:02:12,696 --> 00:02:16,391
OF A YELLOW CAB FIVE TIMES
BY THE GOTTIS AND GAMBINOS,

40
00:02:16,391 --> 00:02:22,642
AS I WAS
FAMOUSLY IN 1992, 1993, AND '94.

41
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:25,216
BUT I'M THE RIGHT CHOICE TO BE
YOUR NEXT MAYOR.

42
00:02:25,216 --> 00:02:27,555
NO OFFENSE TO MR. OPPONENTS, MR. CUOMO,

43
00:02:27,555 --> 00:02:31,618
AND I BELIEVE I'M SAYING
THIS RIGHT, ZOLTAR RAMZOMBIE.

44
00:02:34,022 --> 00:02:36,525
>> THAT'S NOT EVEN CLOSE.

45
00:02:36,525 --> 00:02:39,960
>> ALL RIGHT, CANDIDATES, YOU'RE
ALL RUNNING TO BE MAYOR OF NEW
YORK CITY.

46
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:44,906
SO MY QUESTION IS, WHY WOULD YOU
WANT THE WORST JOB IN THE
WORLD?

47
00:02:44,906 --> 00:02:48,355
>> AS WE ALL KNOW, AS SOON AS
YOU ELECTED MAYOR,

48
00:02:48,355 --> 00:02:50,385
EVERYONE IN
THE CITY IMMEDIATELY HATES YOU.

49
00:02:50,385 --> 00:02:54,458
AND IN THAT WAY, I AM ALREADY
ONE STEP AHEAD OF THE GAME.

50
00:02:55,136 --> 00:02:57,310
>> MR. MAMDANI, SAME QUESTION.

51
00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:00,790
>> I WANT TO BE MAYOR SO I CAN
DELIVER A BETTER NEW YORK,

52
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:04,940
FREE
HEALTH CARE, AFFORDABLE HOUSING,
FREE WI-FI.

53
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:07,390
AS MAYOR, CAN I MAKE THAT
HAPPEN?

54
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:09,558
I'M NOT SURE YET.

55
00:03:09,558 --> 00:03:12,477
BUT TOGETHER, WE'RE GOING TO
FIND OUT.

56
00:03:12,477 --> 00:03:15,778
THAT THE ANSWER IS NO.

57
00:03:16,968 --> 00:03:19,088
>> I GOT TO SAY SOMETHING.

58
00:03:19,088 --> 00:03:21,787
MY OPPONENT, NORMAN VANDANIEL,

59
00:03:21,787 --> 00:03:24,856
IS INEXPERIENCED AND FRANKLY A NEPO BABY,

60
00:03:24,856 --> 00:03:28,396
WHERE MY DAD WAS JUST
GOVERNOR OF NEW YORK.

61
00:03:28,396 --> 00:03:32,331
>> OF COURSE, AS YOU KNOW, MY
DAD WAS BRUTALLY KIDNAPPED

62
00:03:32,331 --> 00:03:36,489
AND
TIED TO THE TRACKS OF THE
CYCLONE AT CONEY ISLAND.

63
00:03:37,106 --> 00:03:39,422
I'M SORRY, WHAT WAS YOUR
QUESTION?

64
00:03:39,422 --> 00:03:44,390
>> WHY DO YOU WANT TO BE MAYOR?
>> OH, I NEED A JOB.

65
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:47,484
>> ALL RIGHT, LET'S MOVE ON TO
MOST IMPORTANT QUESTION TONIGHT.

66
00:03:47,484 --> 00:03:50,781
WHAT'S YOUR GO-TO BAGEL ORDER?
MR. MAMDANI?

67
00:03:50,781 --> 00:03:54,948
>> WHAT I'D LIKE IS FOR THE
PERSON SERVING ME THAT BAGEL

68
00:03:54,948 --> 00:03:57,950
TO
BE PAID A LIVING WAGE.

69
00:04:00,123 --> 00:04:04,393
>> BOO!
RELAX, NERD.

70
00:04:04,393 --> 00:04:07,211
MR. CUOMO, GO-TO BAGEL ORDER?

71
00:04:07,211 --> 00:04:11,256
>> I SWEAR TO GOD I AM NOT
SAYING THIS TO PANDER TO JEWISH
VOTERS.

72
00:04:11,256 --> 00:04:15,843
BUT IT'S A GEFILTE FISH EATEN IN
A BOOTH WITH BARBRA STREISAND

73
00:04:15,843 --> 00:04:17,907
BY THE LIGHT OF A MENORAH.

74
00:04:19,442 --> 00:04:22,619
>> ONCE AGAIN, BOO.

75
00:04:22,619 --> 00:04:25,818
MR. SLIWA, GO-TO BAGEL ORDER.

76
00:04:25,818 --> 00:04:29,752
>> AS YOU KNOW, IN 1982, I HAD
MY PENIS CUT OFF

77
00:04:29,752 --> 00:04:32,726
AND FED TO ME
BY THE YAKUZA.

78
00:04:32,726 --> 00:04:37,099
OBVIOUSLY BLUEBERRY BAGEL, STRAWBERRY
CREAM CHEESE

79
00:04:37,099 --> 00:04:39,167
EATEN OVER A GAR
BACK CAN.

80
00:04:39,167 --> 00:04:41,079
>> THANK YOU, CANDIDATES.

81
00:04:41,079 --> 00:04:44,696
TAKE A MOMENT
LET'S THANK A FEW MORE OF
TONIGHT'S SPONSORS,

82
00:04:44,696 --> 00:04:46,143
PEDICABS.

83
00:04:46,143 --> 00:04:50,061
SLOWER THAN WALKING, LOUDER THAN
HELL.

84
00:04:50,061 --> 00:04:51,982
AND HUDSON YARDS.

85
00:04:51,982 --> 00:04:54,644
SHOP, DINE, OR TAKE THE EASY WAY OUT

86
00:04:54,644 --> 00:04:56,755
AT HUDSON YARDS.

87
00:05:00,542 --> 00:05:04,471
MOVING ON.
MOVING ON TO OUR NEXT TOPIC,

88
00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:07,079
WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO SAY TO
UNDECIDED VOTERS?

89
00:05:07,079 --> 00:05:08,974
GOVERNOR CUOMO, LET'S START WITH
YOU.

90
00:05:08,974 --> 00:05:12,472
>> LISTEN, I HAVE ACTUAL
GOVERNING EXPERIENCE.

91
00:05:12,472 --> 00:05:14,905
I HAVE THE RELATIONSHIPS TO GET
THE JOB DONE

92
00:05:14,905 --> 00:05:18,275
AND THE SUPPORT OF
SOME OF THE FINEST PEOPLE IN THE
CITY.

93
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:22,231
>> LIKE ME, MAYOR ERIC ADAMS.

94
00:05:22,231 --> 00:05:25,005
THIS IS MY GUY RIGHT HERE, MAN.
LISTEN UP.

95
00:05:25,005 --> 00:05:27,242
IF YOU LIKE ME, YOU GONNA LOVE
THIS GUY!

96
00:05:27,242 --> 00:05:29,542
HE LIKE ME PART TWO!

97
00:05:29,542 --> 00:05:32,208
>> WELL, NO, ERIC.
REMEMBER THE PLAN.

98
00:05:32,208 --> 00:05:34,463
>> OH, OH, YEAH I GOT YOU.
I GOT YOU.

99
00:05:34,463 --> 00:05:36,864
I, ERIC ADAMS, ENDORSE HIM,

100
00:05:36,928 --> 00:05:39,194
ZORDAN MAMAGRAMMA.

101
00:05:39,956 --> 00:05:42,377
>> NO, NO, NO THANK YOU.

102
00:05:42,377 --> 00:05:46,424
>> MR. MAMDANI, YOUR MESSAGE TO
UNDECIDED VOTERS?

103
00:05:46,424 --> 00:05:49,353
>> MY MESSAGE IS THIS.

104
00:05:51,473 --> 00:05:55,386
HEY, GIRL.
I KNOW YOU GOT A LITTLE WHITE
GUILT

105
00:05:55,386 --> 00:05:58,552
FOR GENTRIFYING THAT
SPANISH NEIGHBORHOOD, DON'T YOU?

106
00:05:58,552 --> 00:06:00,509
WHY DON'T YOU VOTE FOR ME?

107
00:06:00,509 --> 00:06:03,548
YOU KNOW YOU'LL FEEL A LITTLE
LESS BAD ABOUT THAT CHICKEN AND
RICE SHOP

108
00:06:03,548 --> 00:06:05,902
GETTING TURNED INTO A
SWEETGREENS.

109
00:06:05,902 --> 00:06:08,973
WHY DON'T YOU HIT ME UP AT THE
BALLOT BOX, GIRL?

110
00:06:12,122 --> 00:06:14,494
>> MR. MAMDANI,

111
00:06:14,494 --> 00:06:18,033
YOU WERE WARNED
THAT THIS IS THE FORUM FOR YOUR
TIKTOKRY.

112
00:06:18,033 --> 00:06:22,686
MR. SLIWA, WHY SHOULD NEW
YORKERS VOTE FOR YOU?

113
00:06:22,686 --> 00:06:25,356
>> IT'S SIMPLE.
I'M THE ONLY CANDIDATE HERE

114
00:06:25,356 --> 00:06:28,830
WHO'S BEEN DANGLED WE MY
TESTICLES OVER THE VERAZZANO BRIDGE

115
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:32,649
BY A LITTLE-KNOWN GANG
CALLED THE LORDS OF FLATBUSH.

116
00:06:32,649 --> 00:06:37,751
I WAS ALSO POURED INTO THE
FOUNDATION OF GIANTS STADIUM AND
CRAWLED MY WAY OUT.

117
00:06:37,751 --> 00:06:40,639
JUST ON MY WAY HERE, I WAS
EJACULATED UPON

118
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:45,353
DINER
SPIDER

119
00:06:46,508 --> 00:06:50,515
JUST ON YOUR WAY HERE?

120
00:06:50,515 --> 00:06:52,226
ALL RIGHT, LET'S MOVE ON.

121
00:06:52,226 --> 00:06:56,104
FROM CONGESTION PRICING TO
HOMELESSNESS TO I.C.E. RAIDS,

122
00:06:56,104 --> 00:06:58,432
THERE ARE MANY ISSUES FACING OUR
CITY.

123
00:06:58,432 --> 00:07:02,289
WHAT DO YOU THINK IS THE BIGGEST
PROBLEM YOU HAVE TO CONFRONT AS
MAYOR?

124
00:07:02,289 --> 00:07:04,664
>> IT'S ME!

125
00:07:04,664 --> 00:07:09,138
YES.
THEY CAN PRETEND THIS ELECTION
IS ABOUT HOUSING AND TAXES,

126
00:07:09,138 --> 00:07:11,089
BUT
WE ALL KNOW IT'S ABOUT ME,
RIGHT?

127
00:07:11,089 --> 00:07:14,350
BECAUSE I'M GOING TO BE VERY
INVOLVED, VERY HANDS-ON.

128
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:17,465
THIS GUY KNOWS ABOUT HANDS ON,
RIGHT, CUOMO?

129
00:07:17,465 --> 00:07:19,310
>> HEY-YO, YOU GOT ME.

130
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:22,612
>> LOOK AT THESE CANDIDATES WE
GOT.
LOOK AT CURTIS SLIWA.

131
00:07:22,612 --> 00:07:24,515
I LOVE HIM, BUT WE'VE GOT TO DO
SOMETHING

132
00:07:24,515 --> 00:07:27,312
ABOUT THAT "EMILY IN
PARIS" LOOKING HAT, RIGHT?

133
00:07:27,312 --> 00:07:29,672
HE'S MY "RUSHMORE" MAX!

134
00:07:29,672 --> 00:07:35,171
AND THE FRONT-RUNNER ZORA
MAMDANI.

135
00:07:35,172 --> 00:07:39,942
MCKENZEY

136
00:07:39,942 --> 00:07:42,596
HE'S TOO YOUNG TO LEAD, FOLKS,
HE'S TOO YOUNG.

137
00:07:42,596 --> 00:07:44,699
HE DOESN'T HAVE THE WOBBLY WALK.

138
00:07:44,805 --> 00:07:48,396
OR FRANKLY THE MIND I HAVE.
GOOD BRAIN.

139
00:07:48,396 --> 00:07:53,059
I TOOK A COGNITIVE TEST.
I DID SO WELL ON MY COGNITIVE TEST

140
00:07:53,059 --> 00:07:56,321
THAT THEY IMMEDIATELY GAVE
ME AN MRI.

141
00:07:56,321 --> 00:07:59,545
THEY SAID THEY'D NEVER SEEN
ANYTHING LIKE IT.

142
00:07:59,545 --> 00:08:04,113
BUT IN TERMS OF ELECTION, I'D
LIKE TO GO BACK TO THAT VERY
IMPORTANT QUESTION.

143
00:08:04,113 --> 00:08:09,068
THE BAGEL.
MY GO-TO BAGEL ORDER IS BIG MAC
WITH A HOLE IN THE MIDDLE.

144
00:08:09,068 --> 00:08:13,559
AND I MAY NOT LIVE IN NEW YORK
ANYMORE, AWW!

145
00:08:14,646 --> 00:08:18,822
BUT I'M ALWAYS WATCHING.
LURKING IN THE SHADOWS.

146
00:08:18,822 --> 00:08:22,634
MUCH LIKE THE LATE, GREAT
PHANTOM OF THE OPERA.

147
00:08:22,634 --> 00:08:24,927
TERRIBLE, WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM
IN TERMS OF OPERA

148
00:08:24,927 --> 00:08:28,848
AND WITH
REGARD TO BEING BURNED BY
CHANDELIER.

149
00:08:28,848 --> 00:08:34,239
PERHAPS I'LL ADD "NEW YORK
MAYOR" TO MY LIST OF DUTIES.

150
00:08:34,239 --> 00:08:35,399
COME ON.

151
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:37,674
¶ OPEN UP YOUR MIND

152
00:08:37,674 --> 00:08:41,058
LET YOUR FANTASIES UNWIND ¶

153
00:08:41,058 --> 00:08:44,128
¶ IN THIS DARKNESS WHICH YOU KNOW

154
00:08:44,128 --> 00:08:47,728
YOU CANNOT FIND ¶

155
00:08:47,728 --> 00:08:49,862
¶ THE DARKNESS OF

156
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:55,633
THE MUSIC OF THE NIGHT ¶

157
00:08:55,633 --> 00:09:00,410
AND LIVE FROM NEW YORK, IT'S
SATURDAY NIGHT!

158
00:11:02,785 --> 00:11:08,206
MUSICAL

159
00:11:08,206 --> 00:11:12,506
HOST

160
00:11:14,905 --> 00:11:20,482
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN -- MILES
TELLER!

161
00:11:37,707 --> 00:11:40,583
>> THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK
YOU VERY MUCH.

162
00:11:40,583 --> 00:11:44,019
I AM SO HAPPY TO BE BACK HOSTING
SNL.

163
00:11:44,019 --> 00:11:45,420
THE LAST TIME --

164
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:48,163
THANK YOU.

165
00:11:48,163 --> 00:11:50,841
THE LAST TIME I HOSTED WAS IN
2022.

166
00:11:50,841 --> 00:11:54,721
IT MEANS A LOT TO BE HERE FOR
ME, ESPECIALLY ON HALLOWEEN
WEEKEND.

167
00:11:54,721 --> 00:11:58,932
YEAH, BECAUSE WHEN I WAS A KID,
ME AND MY SISTERS

168
00:11:58,932 --> 00:12:01,940
 USED TO GO
TRICK-OR-TREATING AS "SNL"
CHARACTERS.

169
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:04,657
SO I DON'T KNOW IF YOU REMEMBER
THE NIGHT OF THE ROCKSBURY GUYS.

170
00:12:04,657 --> 00:12:07,833
THEY'RE THE BEST.
WILL FERRELL, CHRIS McCANN.

171
00:12:10,618 --> 00:12:14,424
WHERE ARE THEY?
THERE THEY ARE.

172
00:12:15,204 --> 00:12:17,718
WE WENT AS THEM ONE YEAR, 

173
00:12:17,718 --> 00:12:21,306
AND HERE'S A PHOTO OF ME AND MY
SISTERS.

174
00:12:26,307 --> 00:12:31,547
I MEAN, HONESTLY, I'M JUST NOW
REALIZING HOW FAR OFF WE WERE
WITH THAT LOOK.

175
00:12:31,547 --> 00:12:34,689
IT'S LIKE WE JUST LOOK LIKE
LITTLE GREEK MEN.

176
00:12:34,689 --> 00:12:37,090
IT MUST HAVE BEEN SO CONFUSING,

177
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:39,961
ME AND MY SISTERS GOING UP TO
DOORS JUST LIKE --

178
00:12:46,881 --> 00:12:50,140
BUT GROWING UP, I MOVED AROUND A
LOT.

179
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:54,797
SO "SNL" HAS ALWAYS BEEN ONE OF
THE MORE CONSISTENT PARTS OF MY
LIFE.

180
00:12:54,797 --> 00:12:59,492
I LIVED IN PENNSYLVANIA,
GEORGIA, DELAWARE, JERSEY, AND
FLORIDA.

181
00:12:59,492 --> 00:13:01,016
ALL BEFORE I WAS 12.

182
00:13:01,016 --> 00:13:04,309
SO HONESTLY, IT GETS A BIT
CONFUSING

183
00:13:04,309 --> 00:13:06,783
 WHEN PEOPLE ASK ME
WHERE I'M FROM.

184
00:13:06,783 --> 00:13:09,829
I'M LIKE, I DON'T KNOW, MAN,
TOP GUN 2?

185
00:13:09,829 --> 00:13:12,353
WHERE ARE YOU FROM?

186
00:13:12,353 --> 00:13:14,717
BUT THAT'S WHY I LOVE COMING
HERE.

187
00:13:14,717 --> 00:13:16,763
BECAUSE I HAVE A LOT OF
MEMORIES.

188
00:13:16,763 --> 00:13:20,410
LIKE RIGHT THERE.
THAT'S WHERE I HAD MY FIRST
BEER.

189
00:13:20,476 --> 00:13:27,388
NOT EVER.

190
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:27,856
JUST LIKE TODAY.

191
00:13:30,126 --> 00:13:30,992
AND OVER THERE.

192
00:13:30,994 --> 00:13:32,494
OH, THAT'S WHERE I ALMOST FELL

193
00:13:32,496 --> 00:13:33,928
GETTING OUT OF MY COSTUME.

194
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:35,463
AND RIGHT THERE, THAT'S WHERE

195
00:13:35,465 --> 00:13:38,099
BOWEN SAID, "MILES, YOU PROBABLY

196
00:13:38,101 --> 00:13:39,667
FELL BECAUSE YOU HAD SO MANY

197
00:13:39,669 --> 00:13:40,168
BEERS."

198
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:41,569
I JUST LOVE MEMORIES.

199
00:13:41,571 --> 00:13:43,538
REALLY NICE JUST TO REFLECT.

200
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:45,340
BUT HONESTLY, GUYS, I'M SO HAPPY

201
00:13:45,342 --> 00:13:47,308
TO BE HERE WITH ALL OF YOU.

202
00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:48,510
A LOT HAS HAPPENED SINCE THE

203
00:13:48,512 --> 00:13:50,011
LAST TIME THAT I HOSTED.

204
00:13:50,013 --> 00:13:52,580
A FEW MONTHS AGO, MY WIFE AND I

205
00:13:52,582 --> 00:13:54,249
LOST OUR HOUSE IN THE PALISADES

206
00:13:54,251 --> 00:13:54,549
FIRE.

207
00:13:54,551 --> 00:13:55,817
BUT DON'T WORRY.

208
00:13:55,819 --> 00:13:58,653
SERIOUSLY, DO NOT WORRY.

209
00:13:58,655 --> 00:13:59,220
WE'RE DOING GREAT.

210
00:13:59,222 --> 00:14:00,822
I SEE YOU UP THERE, BABY.

211
00:14:00,824 --> 00:14:02,357
BUT THAT EXPERIENCE HAS MADE ME

212
00:14:02,359 --> 00:14:03,224
INCREDIBLY GRATEFUL TO HAVE SO

213
00:14:03,226 --> 00:14:05,360
MANY PLACES THAT I CAN CALL

214
00:14:05,362 --> 00:14:05,660
HOME.

215
00:14:05,662 --> 00:14:07,161
BUT BASED ON WHAT HAPPENED TO

216
00:14:07,163 --> 00:14:08,296
THE LAST PLACE THAT I CALLED

217
00:14:08,298 --> 00:14:11,099
HOME, I JUST WANT TO SAY --

218
00:14:11,101 --> 00:14:12,300
THERE'S FIRE EXITS LOCATED

219
00:14:12,302 --> 00:14:13,835
THERE, THERE, THERE.

220
00:14:14,237 --> 00:14:15,236
WE GOT TWO IN THE BACK.

221
00:14:15,238 --> 00:14:15,837
THANK YOU, GUYS.

222
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:16,504
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A GREAT

223
00:14:16,506 --> 00:14:16,804
SHOW.

224
00:14:43,833 --> 00:14:45,633
>>> IT'S "WHAT DID I DO LAST

225
00:14:45,635 --> 00:14:45,967
NIGHT?"

226
00:14:45,969 --> 00:14:47,669
AND HERE'S YOUR HOST.

227
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,372
>> HELLO.

228
00:14:51,374 --> 00:14:53,441
HELLO, HELLO, HELLO.

229
00:14:53,443 --> 00:14:54,242
I AM YOUR HOST, GAY FOPAY.

230
00:14:57,247 --> 00:14:59,080
AND WELCOME BACK TO "WHAT DID I

231
00:14:59,082 --> 00:15:00,014
DO LAST NIGHT?"

232
00:15:00,016 --> 00:15:01,816
THE ONLY GAME SHOW WHERE THREE

233
00:15:01,818 --> 00:15:03,451
DEEPLY HUNGOVER CONTESTANTS HAVE

234
00:15:03,453 --> 00:15:05,954
TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THEY GOT UP

235
00:15:05,956 --> 00:15:06,988
TO THE NIGHT BEFORE.

236
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:09,691
AND OF COURSE, TODAY IS OUR

237
00:15:09,693 --> 00:15:10,825
EXTRA-PAINFUL DAY AFTER

238
00:15:10,827 --> 00:15:11,326
HALLOWEEN EDITION.

239
00:15:11,328 --> 00:15:14,862
LET'S MEET OUR PLAYERS.

240
00:15:14,864 --> 00:15:18,333
>> OH, GOD, TURN IT DOWN.

241
00:15:18,335 --> 00:15:21,736
>> FIRST UP WE'VE GOT KENNETH

242
00:15:21,738 --> 00:15:22,570
FROM NEW JERSEY.

243
00:15:22,572 --> 00:15:23,571
HELLO, KENNETH.

244
00:15:23,573 --> 00:15:24,672
OH, MAN, STINKS OVER HERE.

245
00:15:24,674 --> 00:15:28,076
>> YEAH, I CLAWED THE CASTLE

246
00:15:28,078 --> 00:15:28,509
LAST NIGHT.

247
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:29,877
>> WHAT'S THAT?

248
00:15:29,879 --> 00:15:32,447
>> WHEN YOU DRANK 14 WHITE CLAWS

249
00:15:32,449 --> 00:15:33,615
AND EAT WHITE CASTLE.

250
00:15:34,017 --> 00:15:35,850
>> YOU GOT A DEATH WISH,

251
00:15:35,852 --> 00:15:36,184
BROTHER.

252
00:15:36,186 --> 00:15:37,518
NEXT WE HAVE ELIZABETH FROM NEW

253
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:37,852
MEXICO.

254
00:15:37,854 --> 00:15:38,419
WHAT WAS YOUR COSTUME?

255
00:15:38,421 --> 00:15:40,722
>> SEXY CAT.

256
00:15:40,724 --> 00:15:41,456
>> I'M SURE IT STARTED THAT WAY.

257
00:15:44,361 --> 00:15:45,727
IF YOU WERE AT THE SHELTER,

258
00:15:45,729 --> 00:15:47,795
YOU'D BE PUT DOWN, GIRL.

259
00:15:48,198 --> 00:15:52,066
AND YOUR NAME IS RONDELL FROM

260
00:15:52,068 --> 00:15:52,367
WHERE?

261
00:15:52,369 --> 00:15:52,934
>> RON FROM DELAWARE.

262
00:15:55,438 --> 00:15:56,904
I WAS SHAKING WHEN I WROTE THAT.

263
00:15:56,906 --> 00:15:59,140
>> YEAH, OKAY.

264
00:15:59,142 --> 00:16:00,375
LOUIS, TELL THEM WHAT THEY'RE

265
00:16:00,377 --> 00:16:00,875
PLAYING FOR.

266
00:16:00,877 --> 00:16:03,044
>> TODAY'S GRAND PRIZE IS A

267
00:16:03,046 --> 00:16:05,513
LARGE PEDIALYTE AND A BACON, EGG

268
00:16:05,515 --> 00:16:05,913
AND CHEESE.

269
00:16:05,915 --> 00:16:06,381
>> OH!

270
00:16:06,383 --> 00:16:06,914
>> MY GOD.

271
00:16:06,916 --> 00:16:07,682
>> I NEED THAT.

272
00:16:07,684 --> 00:16:08,483
>> I NEED THAT NOW.

273
00:16:08,485 --> 00:16:08,783
>> OH!

274
00:16:08,785 --> 00:16:10,885
>> I NEED THAT.

275
00:16:10,887 --> 00:16:12,954
>> WELL, YOU CAN HAVE IT IF YOU

276
00:16:12,956 --> 00:16:13,755
WIN.

277
00:16:13,757 --> 00:16:15,723
KENNETH, YOU'RE UP FIRST.

278
00:16:15,725 --> 00:16:17,725
WHAT WAS YOUR UBER FAUX PAS?

279
00:16:17,727 --> 00:16:22,196
WAS IT "A," A LITTLE PUKE?

280
00:16:22,198 --> 00:16:25,299
B, MAJOR MADE YOUR DRIVER GO

281
00:16:25,301 --> 00:16:27,368
THROUGH THE DRIVE-THRU AND PAY

282
00:16:27,370 --> 00:16:30,905
FOR YOUR FOOD?

283
00:16:30,907 --> 00:16:33,508
OR "C," ASKED FOR THE AUX THEN

284
00:16:33,510 --> 00:16:34,242
WATCHED PORN?

285
00:16:34,644 --> 00:16:36,277
>> KNOWING MYSELF, I'D SAY I

286
00:16:36,279 --> 00:16:37,178
PUKED IN THE UBER.

287
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:38,479
>> OH, SO CLOSE.

288
00:16:38,481 --> 00:16:40,081
THAT WAS ACTUALLY A TRICK

289
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:40,448
QUESTION.

290
00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:41,816
YOU DID PUKE, BUT IT WASN'T IN

291
00:16:41,818 --> 00:16:42,583
AN UBER.

292
00:16:42,585 --> 00:16:43,918
YOU JUST SAW A GUY IN A CAMRY,

293
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:44,385
AND YOU GOT IN.

294
00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:47,922
>> IN MY DEFENSE, I DO THAT A

295
00:16:47,924 --> 00:16:50,358
LOT.

296
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:52,126
>> DOESN'T MATTER.

297
00:16:52,128 --> 00:16:53,728
YOUR PENALTY IS -- LISTENING TO

298
00:16:53,730 --> 00:16:55,697
MY NEPHEW, ANDRE, LEARN THE SAX.

299
00:16:55,699 --> 00:16:55,997
>> NO.

300
00:16:55,999 --> 00:16:58,800
¶¶

301
00:16:58,802 --> 00:16:59,300
>> OH, OH!

302
00:16:59,302 --> 00:16:59,634
>> STOP!

303
00:16:59,636 --> 00:17:04,172
>> NO, NO!

304
00:17:04,574 --> 00:17:06,641
>> ALL RIGHT.

305
00:17:06,643 --> 00:17:08,309
NEXT UP, ELIZABETH.

306
00:17:08,311 --> 00:17:10,411
YOUR QUESTION IS, WHO DID YOU

307
00:17:10,413 --> 00:17:11,145
BITE, AND WHERE DID YOU BITE

308
00:17:11,147 --> 00:17:11,446
THEM?

309
00:17:11,448 --> 00:17:13,781
>> I BIT SOMEONE?

310
00:17:13,783 --> 00:17:15,149
>> YOU MOST CERTAINLY DID.

311
00:17:15,151 --> 00:17:17,852
AND YOUR CHOICES ARE, "A," YOUR

312
00:17:17,854 --> 00:17:20,822
FRIEND JENNA IN THE NECK.

313
00:17:20,824 --> 00:17:22,990

YOU STOLE HIS COSTUME.

JONATHAN, AND I'M A CONTRACTOR.

404
00:20:14,864 --> 00:20:15,897
THAT MEANS I FIND THE PERFECT

405
00:20:15,899 --> 00:20:17,365
PROPERTY --

406
00:20:17,367 --> 00:20:18,633
>> AND I ACTUALLY HAVE TO

407
00:20:18,635 --> 00:20:23,004
RENOVATE THE DARN THING.

409
00:20:24,641 --> 00:20:25,940
OUR BIGGEST CHALLENGE YET --

410

THE GAY?

416
00:20:34,651 --> 00:20:36,384
>> I MARRIED THE NEW GIRL.

417
00:20:36,386 --> 00:20:38,152
>> DONALD AND MELANIA MOVED INTO

418
00:20:38,154 --> 00:20:39,153
THIS HOUSE NINE YEARS AGO.

419
00:20:39,155 --> 00:20:42,590
THEY WERE EVICTED FOR FOUR

420
00:20:42,592 --> 00:20:45,927
YEARS, BUT THEY MOVED BACK IN.

421
00:20:45,929 --> 00:20:46,594
DONALD HAS A STRONG EYE FOR

422
00:20:46,596 --> 00:20:48,496
INTERIOR DESIGN.

423
00:20:48,498 --> 00:20:49,130
>> I PUT THESE GOLD URNS

424
00:20:49,132 --> 00:20:49,764
EVERYWHERE.

425
00:20:49,766 --> 00:20:50,498
LIKE A HUNDRED IN EVERY ROOM.

426
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:51,265
THAT MAKES ME HAPPY.

427
00:20:51,267 --> 00:20:51,999
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO BE HAPPY

428
00:20:52,001 --> 00:20:54,001
THESE DAYS.

429
00:20:54,003 --> 00:20:54,735
REALLY DARK STUFF HAPPENING IN

430
00:20:54,737 --> 00:20:55,503
THE WORLD.

431
00:20:55,505 --> 00:20:58,005
SOME OF IT ME.

432
00:20:58,007 --> 00:20:59,507
AND HERE'S A CROWN I JUST GOT

433
00:20:59,509 --> 00:21:02,009
FROM MY TRIP TO ASIA.

434
00:21:02,011 --> 00:21:02,710
NOTHING SAYS DEMOCRACY LIKE A

435
00:21:02,712 --> 00:21:07,515
CROWN, RIGHT?

436
00:21:07,517 --> 00:21:08,249
>> AND HIS WIFE, MELANIA, SHE'S

437
00:21:08,251 --> 00:21:09,016
GOT A STYLE ALL HER OWN.

>> I LOVE THIS HALLOWEEN

439
00:21:12,488 --> 00:21:13,087
DECORATIONS YOU PUT UP.

440
00:21:13,089 --> 00:21:15,156
>> THAT'S FOR CHRISTMAS.

441
00:21:15,158 --> 00:21:15,890
>> THE TRUMPS HAVE ALREADY MADE

442
00:21:15,892 --> 00:21:16,624
A FEW SUBTLE CHANGES TO THE

443
00:21:16,626 --> 00:21:21,395
HOUSE.

444
00:21:21,397 --> 00:21:22,129
>> DONALD PUT A PAINTING OF

445
00:21:22,131 --> 00:21:23,364
HIMSELF AS A SOLDIER FROM

446
00:21:23,366 --> 00:21:24,732
HALO.

447
00:21:27,003 --> 00:21:28,002
>> YOU KNOW YOU CAN'T SAY MASTER

448
00:21:28,004 --> 00:21:28,836
CHIEF ANYMORE.

449
00:21:28,838 --> 00:21:29,770
RIGHT?

450
00:21:29,772 --> 00:21:31,238
YOU'VE GOT TO SAY PRIMARY CHIEF.

451
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,273
>> THEY ALSO PAVED THE ROSE

452
00:21:32,275 --> 00:21:33,507
GARDEN AND TURNED IT INTO WHAT

453
00:21:33,509 --> 00:21:34,508
LOOKS LIKE OUTDOOR SKATING AT AN

454
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:38,479
OLIVE GARDEN.

455
00:21:38,481 --> 00:21:40,081
DONALD AND MELANIA STILL FEEL

456
00:21:40,083 --> 00:21:41,515
LIKE SOMETHING'S MISSING.

457
00:21:41,517 --> 00:21:42,249
>> THE HOUSE IS ONLY 55,000

458
00:21:42,251 --> 00:21:43,017
SQUARE FEET.

459
00:21:43,019 --> 00:21:44,018
AND 132 ROOMS.

460
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:46,120
>> WE NEED MORE SPACE!

461
00:21:46,122 --> 00:21:46,887
RIGHT?

462
00:21:46,889 --> 00:21:48,389
WE NEED MORE SPACE!

463
00:21:48,391 --> 00:21:50,124
>> WE NEED A BALLROOM BECAUSE

464
00:21:50,126 --> 00:21:51,125
DONALD, HE LOVES TO DANCE.

465
00:21:51,127 --> 00:21:54,128
>> I'M A TERRIFIC DANCER.

466
00:21:54,130 --> 00:21:58,632
TERRIFIC DANCER.

467
00:21:58,634 --> 00:21:59,166
JUST ASK YOUR EYES.

468
00:21:59,168 --> 00:22:00,134
RIGHT?

469
00:22:00,636 --> 00:22:01,635
>> WE ASKED DONALD WHAT HIS

470
00:22:01,637 --> 00:22:02,370
BUDGET WAS, AND HE SAID BETWEEN

471
00:22:02,372 --> 00:22:03,738
$350 MILLION AND INFINITY.

472
00:22:05,041 --> 00:22:08,509
THEN WE ASKED IF HE NEEDED A

473
00:22:08,511 --> 00:22:09,176
PERMIT, AND DONALD LAUGHED

474
00:22:09,178 --> 00:22:09,777
REALLY HARD.

475
00:22:09,779 --> 00:22:10,511
HE SAID, I COULD BUILD THIS

476
00:22:10,513 --> 00:22:11,245
BALLROOM WITH THE BONES OF MY

477
00:22:11,247 --> 00:22:12,246
ENEMIES, AND NO ONE COULD STOP

478
00:22:12,248 --> 00:22:12,947
ME, AS OPPOSED TO A BONEHEAD

479
00:22:12,949 --> 00:22:13,748
LIKE MY BROTHER.

480
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:18,986
>> OH, YOU HUSH UP.

481
00:22:18,988 --> 00:22:22,189
>> WE SHOWED DONALD OUR PLAN FOR

482
00:22:22,191 --> 00:22:23,791
A BALLROOM THAT WOULD MATCH THE

483
00:22:23,793 --> 00:22:24,959
CURRENT PROPORTIONS, BUT HE KEPT

484
00:22:24,961 --> 00:22:27,461

>> I KNOW THIS IS PROBABLY

832
00:31:50,759 --> 00:31:54,294
WRONG, BUT -- MAYBE THE BOOB

THOUSANDS OF LAYOFFS WITH TARGET

855

WORKFORCE.

858
00:32:46,015 --> 00:32:47,147
WHILE COMPANIES LOOK TO PROTECT

859
00:32:47,149 --> 00:32:48,015
THEIR BOTTOM LINES, AMERICAN

860
00:32:48,017 --> 00:32:51,084
HOUSEHOLDS ARE DOING THE SAME.

861
00:32:55,691 --> 00:32:56,857

RISING PRICES FOR GROCERIES AND

867
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:05,098
UTILITIES --

868
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:07,968
>> OH!

869
00:33:07,970 --> 00:33:10,537
OH!

870
00:33:10,539 --> 00:33:10,904
I'M SORRY.

871
00:33:10,906 --> 00:33:11,271
I'M FINE.

872
00:33:11,273 --> 00:33:13,206
I APOLOGIZE.

873
00:33:13,208 --> 00:33:14,808
>> APOLOGIES FOR THAT.

874
00:33:14,810 --> 00:33:15,776
THE BIG QUESTION HERE, IS THIS

875
00:33:15,778 --> 00:33:18,111
THE START OF A LONGER, STEEPER

876
00:33:18,113 --> 00:33:18,445
DECLINE?

877
00:33:18,447 --> 00:33:20,947
>> WELL, DAPHNE, THAT'S UP TO

878
00:33:20,949 --> 00:33:22,849
HOW MUCH OF THIS OVERHEATED A.I.

879
00:33:22,851 --> 00:33:23,984
SECTOR IS EVEN REAL.

880
00:33:23,986 --> 00:33:25,919
IF IT'S A BUBBLE, IT'S GOING TO

881
00:33:25,921 --> 00:33:26,553
BURST SOONER OR LATER.

882
00:33:26,555 --> 00:33:27,754
>> LET'S HOPE IT DOESN'T BURST,

883
00:33:27,756 --> 00:33:29,322
WE JUST SPENT A LOT OF MONEY ON

884
00:33:29,324 --> 00:33:30,290
THIS NEW STUDIO.

885
00:33:30,292 --> 00:33:32,259
>> HEY, WHOEVER REPORTED ME TO

886
00:33:32,261 --> 00:33:33,026
HR, SAY IT TO MY FACE NEXT TIME!

887
00:33:36,699 --> 00:33:39,332
>> SORRY.

888
00:33:39,334 --> 00:33:41,101
STILL ADJUSTING TO THE NEW

889
00:33:41,103 --> 00:33:41,435
LAYOUT.

890
00:33:41,437 --> 00:33:42,669
>> ACTUALLY, I THINK IT'S QUITE

891
00:33:42,671 --> 00:33:45,605
AN UPGRADE.

892
00:33:45,607 --> 00:33:46,339
SUCH A FUN LITTLE TREAT FOR THE

893
00:33:46,341 --> 00:33:47,040
VIEWERS TO GET A LITTLE PEEK

894
00:33:47,042 --> 00:33:47,574
BEHIND THE CURTAIN.

895
00:33:50,279 --> 00:33:52,045
>> PROFESSOR, NOW, WHAT DO YOU

896
00:33:52,047 --> 00:33:52,879
MAKE OF THIS?

897
00:33:52,881 --> 00:33:53,580
BECAUSE ON PAPER, INFLATION

898
00:33:53,582 --> 00:33:58,719
RATES ARE PRETTY LOW.

899
00:33:59,822 --> 00:34:02,089
>> WELL, ON THE SCREEN,

900
00:34:02,091 --> 00:34:02,756
INFLATION RATES SEEM PRETTY

901
00:34:02,758 --> 00:34:03,056
HUGE.

902
00:34:10,065 --> 00:34:12,933
>> ALL RIGHT, SOMEONE HACKED MY

903
00:34:12,935 --> 00:34:14,901
COMMUNITY, PUT MANGA ROCK ON IT

904
00:34:14,903 --> 00:34:15,235
AGAIN.

905
00:34:15,237 --> 00:34:16,403
>> YEAH, SURE, BUDDY.

906
00:34:16,405 --> 00:34:18,705
BUT LOOK, PRICES ARE RISING, BUT

907
00:34:18,707 --> 00:34:20,173
SO ARE THE MARKETS.

908
00:34:20,175 --> 00:34:20,807
WE'RE STILL SOLID.

909
00:34:20,809 --> 00:34:21,942
>> EVERYDAY AMERICANS ARE

910
00:34:21,944 --> 00:34:22,976
CERTAINLY STRUGGLING.

911
00:34:22,978 --> 00:34:24,778
RESULTS FROM A NEW SURVEY SHOWED

912
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:26,179
52% OF AMERICANS ARE LIVING

913
00:34:26,181 --> 00:34:31,284
PAYCHECK TO PAYCHECK.

914
00:34:31,286 --> 00:34:33,420
>> OH, SAO PAULO MARKETS, I DO

915
00:34:33,422 --> 00:34:35,822
IT ALL, BABY, PACKING IT --

916
00:34:35,824 --> 00:34:37,023
>> SORRY.

917
00:34:37,025 --> 00:34:38,191
HECTIC NEWS DAY.

918
00:34:38,193 --> 00:34:39,626
AND THIS IS CONCERNING.

919
00:34:39,628 --> 00:34:42,696
1 IN 3 AMERICANS DESCRIBE THEIR

920
00:34:42,698 --> 00:34:44,030
FINANCIAL SITUATION AS IN

921
00:34:44,032 --> 00:34:44,364
CRISIS.

922
00:34:44,366 --> 00:34:45,599
IS THIS JUST THE BEGINNING,

923
00:34:45,601 --> 00:34:45,966
PROFESSOR?

924
00:34:45,968 --> 00:34:50,570
>> WELL, I THINK WE'LL SEE -- I

925
00:34:50,572 --> 00:34:52,639
THINK WE'LL SEE MORE LAYOFFS AND

926
00:34:52,641 --> 00:34:56,076
PRICE HIKES, BUT THE CEILING IS

927
00:34:56,078 --> 00:34:57,778
RAISING THE PRICE -- HEY, EXCUSE

928
00:34:57,780 --> 00:34:58,812
ME, DFNY.

929
00:34:58,814 --> 00:35:02,349
JUST TAKE THE PAPER OUT THE

00:35:02,351 --> 00:35:02,649
TRAY!

931
00:35:02,651 --> 00:35:03,350
>> PROFESSOR, YOU WERE SAYING?

932
00:35:03,352 --> 00:35:05,385
>> SORRY.

933
00:35:05,387 --> 00:35:08,054
NOW, THE TARIFFS HAVEN'T HELPED

934
00:35:08,056 --> 00:35:08,388
THINGS.

935
00:35:08,390 --> 00:35:09,456
>> ESPECIALLY WITH THE SUPPLY

936
00:35:09,458 --> 00:35:10,891
CHAIN THAT'S STILL RECOVERING

937
00:35:10,893 --> 00:35:11,458
FROM THE COVID ERA.

938
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:12,759
>> OH!

939
00:35:15,831 --> 00:35:17,697
>> OH, YIKES.

940
00:35:17,699 --> 00:35:19,499
A LITTLE PRINTER ISSUE.

941
00:35:19,501 --> 00:35:20,100
IS EVERYONE OKAY?

942
00:35:20,102 --> 00:35:22,235
>> NO, I JUST GOT ELECTROCUTED,

943
00:35:22,237 --> 00:35:24,237
BITCH!

944
00:35:26,608 --> 00:35:28,041
OKAY, WE'RE GOOD.

945
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:32,913

946
00:35:32,915 --> 00:35:34,548
PLEASE CONTINUE, PROFESSOR.

947
00:35:34,550 --> 00:35:35,649
>> I'LL GO GET HELP.

948
00:35:35,651 --> 00:35:37,184
>> ACTUALLY, ONE SECOND, I THINK

949
00:35:37,186 --> 00:35:39,019
THIS DUDE IS GOING TO FALL

950
00:35:39,021 --> 00:35:39,319
AGAIN.

951
00:35:39,721 --> 00:35:40,287
YEP, THERE IT IS.

952
00:35:40,289 --> 00:35:42,222
>> WELL, LOOKS LIKE WE'RE AT THE

953
00:35:42,224 --> 00:35:42,722
BREAK.

954
00:35:42,724 --> 00:35:45,258
MORE WITH PROFESSOR HENRY AFTER

A WALL STAT.

>>> PRESIDENT TRUMP AND THE

1058
00:41:40,448 --> 00:41:42,348
FIRST LADY HOSTED A

1059
00:41:42,350 --> 00:41:43,383
TRICK-OR-TREAT EVENT AT WHAT'S

1060
00:41:43,385 --> 00:41:44,851
LEFT OF THE WHITE HOUSE.

1061
00:41:45,253 --> 00:41:46,019
AND THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE

1062
00:41:46,021 --> 00:41:47,253
THINGS THAT THE PRESIDENT DOES

1063
00:41:47,255 --> 00:41:49,155
BECAUSE IT'S SO CLEAR HE NEVER

1064
00:41:49,157 --> 00:41:50,757
TRICK-OR-TREATED ONCE IN HIS

1065
00:41:50,759 --> 00:41:51,124
LIFE.

1066
00:41:51,126 --> 00:41:52,926
IN HIS FIRST TERM, HERE'S HOW HE

1067
00:41:52,928 --> 00:41:53,760
GAVE CANDY TO A KID DRESSED AS A

1068
00:41:53,762 --> 00:41:57,297
MINION.

1069
00:42:04,105 --> 00:42:05,538
MELANIA'S JUST LIKE, I GUESS

1070
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:06,639
THAT IS HOW IT'S DONE.

1071
00:42:07,042 --> 00:42:08,241
THEN AGAIN THIS YEAR, HE DID IT

1072
00:42:08,243 --> 00:42:09,242
TO A KID DRESSED AS DJ

1073
00:42:09,244 --> 00:42:17,817
MARSHMALLOW.

1074
00:42:18,219 --> 00:42:20,954
JUST PUT IT IN THE BAG.

1075
00:42:20,956 --> 00:42:21,854
WHY IS HE SO WEIRD?

1076
00:42:21,856 --> 00:42:24,057
EVEN THE KID IS LIKE, THIS IS

1077
00:42:24,059 --> 00:42:25,391
NOT RIGHT.

1078
00:42:25,794 --> 00:42:27,493
IT'S KIND OF AN EMBODIMENT OF

1079
00:42:27,495 --> 00:42:28,761
HIS SPIRE PRESIDENCY, BECAUSE

1080
00:42:28,763 --> 00:42:30,496
IT'S JUST A VIOLATION OF NORMS

1081
00:42:30,498 --> 00:42:32,532
THAT NO OTHER PRESIDENT OR

1082
00:42:32,534 --> 00:42:34,534
PERSON HAS EVER CONCEIVED OF.

1083
00:42:34,536 --> 00:42:35,468
LIKE, WHO'S EVER THOUGHT, I

1084
00:42:35,470 --> 00:42:36,135
SHOULD PUT THE CANDY ON THE

1085
00:42:36,137 --> 00:42:36,536
KID'S HEAD.

1086
00:42:38,573 --> 00:42:39,806
MY FAVORE PART, THOUGH, IS

1087
00:42:39,808 --> 00:42:41,307
WHEN TRUMP AND MELANIA MADE A

1088
00:42:41,309 --> 00:42:43,142
GRAND ENTRANCE TO THIS SONG.

1089

OUT OF FUNDS TODAY.

1096
00:43:14,843 --> 00:43:16,209
BUT THE GOVERNMENT STILL

PROVIDES FREE FOOD TO FAMILIES

AND I CAN'T BELIEVE I GET TO SAY

1105
00:43:28,790 --> 00:43:30,223

WHEN ASKED HOW THE MEETING WENT,

1110
00:43:42,871 --> 00:43:43,503
TRUMP SAID THIS.

1111

>> BUT OVERALL, I GUESS ON THE

1112

THE PEST?

1114
00:43:48,009 --> 00:43:48,708
I WOULD SAY THE MEETING WAS A

1115
00:43:48,710 --> 00:43:49,275
12.

1116
00:43:52,647 --> 00:43:54,080

SHOW CHINA WE'RE STILL WAY WORSE

1118
00:43:55,316 --> 00:43:55,648
AT MATH.

1119
00:44:00,422 --> 00:44:02,055
TRUMP ALSO VISITED SOUTH KOREA

1120
00:44:02,057 --> 00:44:04,290
AND WAS GIVEN A GOLD CROWN AND

1121

SERVED BEEF PATTIES WITH KETCHUP

1122

FOR DINNER.

1123
00:44:07,062 --> 00:44:08,127
