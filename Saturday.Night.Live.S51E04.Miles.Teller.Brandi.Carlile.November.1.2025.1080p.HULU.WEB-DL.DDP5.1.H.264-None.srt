1
00:00:00,162 --> 00:00:04,298
>>> YOU'RE WATCHING NEW YORK 1,
NEW YORK'S NUMBER FIVE NEWS
STATION.

2
00:00:09,481 --> 00:00:11,712
>> HELLO.

3
00:00:12,611 --> 00:00:15,282
HELLO AND GOOD EVENING FROM NEW
YORK 1.

4
00:00:15,282 --> 00:00:16,454
YAMMER ROLL LOUIS,

5
00:00:16,454 --> 00:00:21,146
AND I AM NOW OFFICIALLY THE LEAST FAMOUS
PERSON TO BE IMPERSONATED ON
SNL.

6
00:00:21,146 --> 00:00:24,563
BUT TRUST ME, IT'S UNCANNY.

7
00:00:24,563 --> 00:00:28,163
WE'RE COMING TO YOU LIVE FOR
THIS THE THIRD, FINAL,

8
00:00:28,163 --> 00:00:31,378
AND
FICTIONAL NEW YORK CITY MAYORAL
DEBATE.

9
00:00:31,378 --> 00:00:35,493
TONIGHT'S EVENT IS SPONSORED BY
GRISTINI'S SUPERMARKET.

10
00:00:35,493 --> 00:00:38,544
SAY, WHERE DID YOU GET THAT WET
SANDWICH?

11
00:00:38,544 --> 00:00:40,715
WHY, GRISTITI'S, OF COURSE.

12
00:00:40,715 --> 00:00:42,709
AND BIKE LANES.

13
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:44,935
YOU WANT A NEW WAY TO DIE?

14
00:00:45,247 --> 00:00:47,912
STEP INTO A BIKE LANE.

15
00:00:47,912 --> 00:00:50,885
TONIGHT, WE'RE GOING TO HEAR
FROM TWO VIABLE CANDIDATES

16
00:00:50,885 --> 00:00:53,582
AND
ONE GOOD OLD-FASHIONED NEW YORK
NUT.

17
00:00:53,582 --> 00:00:58,210
FIRST UP, FORMER NEW YORK
GOVERNOR ANDREW CUOMO.

18
00:01:00,526 --> 00:01:03,652
>> HELLO, VOTERS.
YOU ALL KNOW ME.

19
00:01:03,652 --> 00:01:05,402
I GOT US THROUGH COVID, AND THEN

20
00:01:05,402 --> 00:01:09,040
YADA YADA YADA, HONK HONK,
SQUEEZE SQUEEZE.

21
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,777
ANYWAY, I'M BACK.

22
00:01:10,777 --> 00:01:14,246
I'M A BORN AND BRED NEW YORKER.
I LOVE IT HERE.

23
00:01:14,246 --> 00:01:17,364
I KNOW THIS CITY LIKE THE BACK
OF A WOMAN'S BACK,

24
00:01:17,364 --> 00:01:19,543
MAMMA MIA!

25
00:01:20,238 --> 00:01:25,281
>> NEXT WE HAVE THE DEMOCRATIC
NOMINEE, ZOHRAN MAMDANI.

26
00:01:27,121 --> 00:01:30,169
>> HELLO, EVERYONE.
I'M HAPPY TO BE HERE.

27
00:01:30,169 --> 00:01:34,619
AND I'M READY TO SPEND THE NEXT
HOUR HEARING MY OPPONENTS
PRONOUNCE MY NAME

28
00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:37,818
IN WAYS YOU
COULDN'T BEGIN TO IMAGINE.

29
00:01:37,818 --> 00:01:40,647
AND I KNOW SOME OF YOU ARE OUT
THERE SCARED

30
00:01:40,647 --> 00:01:43,417
OF THE IDEA OF A
YOUNG SOCIAL LIST MUSLIM MAYOR,

31
00:01:43,417 --> 00:01:45,027
SO ALLOW ME TO PUT YOU AT EASE --

32
00:01:45,027 --> 00:01:47,626
BY SMILING AFTER EVERY ANSWER

33
00:01:47,626 --> 00:01:51,253
IN A WAY THAT PHYSICALLY
HURTS MY FACE.

34
00:01:54,873 --> 00:01:56,514
>> ALL RIGHT.

35
00:01:56,514 --> 00:01:59,674
AND NOW LET'S DO A FUN ONE.

36
00:02:00,059 --> 00:02:04,125
THE REPUBLICAN NOMINEE, CURTIS
SLIWA.

37
00:02:04,682 --> 00:02:08,896
YES.
MR. SLIWA, YOUR OPENING
STATEMENT?

38
00:02:08,896 --> 00:02:12,696
>> I'M THRILLED TO BE HERE AND
NOT GETTING SHOT IN THE BACK

39
00:02:12,696 --> 00:02:16,391
OF A YELLOW CAB FIVE TIMES
BY THE GOTTIS AND GAMBINOS,

40
00:02:16,391 --> 00:02:22,642
AS I WAS
FAMOUSLY IN 1992, 1993, AND '94.

41
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:25,216
BUT I'M THE RIGHT CHOICE TO BE
YOUR NEXT MAYOR.

42
00:02:25,216 --> 00:02:27,555
NO OFFENSE TO MR. OPPONENTS, MR. CUOMO,

43
00:02:27,555 --> 00:02:31,618
AND I BELIEVE I'M SAYING
THIS RIGHT, ZOLTAR RAMZOMBIE.

44
00:02:34,022 --> 00:02:36,525
>> THAT'S NOT EVEN CLOSE.

45
00:02:36,525 --> 00:02:39,960
>> ALL RIGHT, CANDIDATES, YOU'RE
ALL RUNNING TO BE MAYOR OF NEW
YORK CITY.

46
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:44,906
SO MY QUESTION IS, WHY WOULD YOU
WANT THE WORST JOB IN THE
WORLD?

47
00:02:44,906 --> 00:02:48,355
>> AS WE ALL KNOW, AS SOON AS
YOU ELECTED MAYOR,

48
00:02:48,355 --> 00:02:50,385
EVERYONE IN
THE CITY IMMEDIATELY HATES YOU.

49
00:02:50,385 --> 00:02:54,458
AND IN THAT WAY, I AM ALREADY
ONE STEP AHEAD OF THE GAME.

50
00:02:55,136 --> 00:02:57,310
>> MR. MAMDANI, SAME QUESTION.

51
00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:00,790
>> I WANT TO BE MAYOR SO I CAN
DELIVER A BETTER NEW YORK,

52
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:04,940
FREE
HEALTH CARE, AFFORDABLE HOUSING,
FREE WI-FI.

53
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:07,390
AS MAYOR, CAN I MAKE THAT
HAPPEN?

54
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:09,558
I'M NOT SURE YET.

55
00:03:09,558 --> 00:03:12,477
BUT TOGETHER, WE'RE GOING TO
FIND OUT.

56
00:03:12,477 --> 00:03:15,778
THAT THE ANSWER IS NO.

57
00:03:16,968 --> 00:03:19,088
>> I GOT TO SAY SOMETHING.

58
00:03:19,088 --> 00:03:21,787
MY OPPONENT, NORMAN VANDANIEL,

59
00:03:21,787 --> 00:03:24,856
IS INEXPERIENCED AND FRANKLY A NEPO BABY,

60
00:03:24,856 --> 00:03:28,396
WHERE MY DAD WAS JUST
GOVERNOR OF NEW YORK.

61
00:03:28,396 --> 00:03:32,331
>> OF COURSE, AS YOU KNOW, MY
DAD WAS BRUTALLY KIDNAPPED

62
00:03:32,331 --> 00:03:36,489
AND
TIED TO THE TRACKS OF THE
CYCLONE AT CONEY ISLAND.

63
00:03:37,106 --> 00:03:39,422
I'M SORRY, WHAT WAS YOUR
QUESTION?

64
00:03:39,422 --> 00:03:44,390
>> WHY DO YOU WANT TO BE MAYOR?
>> OH, I NEED A JOB.

65
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:47,484
>> ALL RIGHT, LET'S MOVE ON TO
MOST IMPORTANT QUESTION TONIGHT.

66
00:03:47,484 --> 00:03:50,781
WHAT'S YOUR GO-TO BAGEL ORDER?
MR. MAMDANI?

67
00:03:50,781 --> 00:03:54,948
>> WHAT I'D LIKE IS FOR THE
PERSON SERVING ME THAT BAGEL

68
00:03:54,948 --> 00:03:57,950
TO
BE PAID A LIVING WAGE.

69
00:04:00,123 --> 00:04:04,393
>> BOO!
RELAX, NERD.

70
00:04:04,393 --> 00:04:07,211
MR. CUOMO, GO-TO BAGEL ORDER?

71
00:04:07,211 --> 00:04:11,256
>> I SWEAR TO GOD I AM NOT
SAYING THIS TO PANDER TO JEWISH
VOTERS.

72
00:04:11,256 --> 00:04:15,843
BUT IT'S A GEFILTE FISH EATEN IN
A BOOTH WITH BARBRA STREISAND

73
00:04:15,843 --> 00:04:17,907
BY THE LIGHT OF A MENORAH.

74
00:04:19,442 --> 00:04:22,619
>> ONCE AGAIN, BOO.

75
00:04:22,619 --> 00:04:25,818
MR. SLIWA, GO-TO BAGEL ORDER.

76
00:04:25,818 --> 00:04:29,752
>> AS YOU KNOW, IN 1982, I HAD
MY PENIS CUT OFF

77
00:04:29,752 --> 00:04:32,726
AND FED TO ME
BY THE YAKUZA.

78
00:04:32,726 --> 00:04:37,099
OBVIOUSLY BLUEBERRY BAGEL, STRAWBERRY
CREAM CHEESE

79
00:04:37,099 --> 00:04:39,167
EATEN OVER A GAR
BACK CAN.

80
00:04:39,167 --> 00:04:41,079
>> THANK YOU, CANDIDATES.

81
00:04:41,079 --> 00:04:44,696
TAKE A MOMENT
LET'S THANK A FEW MORE OF
TONIGHT'S SPONSORS,

82
00:04:44,696 --> 00:04:46,143
PEDICABS.

83
00:04:46,143 --> 00:04:50,061
SLOWER THAN WALKING, LOUDER THAN
HELL.

84
00:04:50,061 --> 00:04:51,982
AND HUDSON YARDS.

85
00:04:51,982 --> 00:04:54,644
SHOP, DINE, OR TAKE THE EASY WAY OUT

86
00:04:54,644 --> 00:04:56,755
AT HUDSON YARDS.

87
00:05:00,542 --> 00:05:04,471
MOVING ON.
MOVING ON TO OUR NEXT TOPIC,

88
00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:07,079
WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO SAY TO
UNDECIDED VOTERS?

89
00:05:07,079 --> 00:05:08,974
GOVERNOR CUOMO, LET'S START WITH
YOU.

90
00:05:08,974 --> 00:05:12,472
>> LISTEN, I HAVE ACTUAL
GOVERNING EXPERIENCE.

91
00:05:12,472 --> 00:05:14,905
I HAVE THE RELATIONSHIPS TO GET
THE JOB DONE

92
00:05:14,905 --> 00:05:18,275
AND THE SUPPORT OF
SOME OF THE FINEST PEOPLE IN THE
CITY.

93
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:22,231
>> LIKE ME, MAYOR ERIC ADAMS.

94
00:05:22,231 --> 00:05:25,005
THIS IS MY GUY RIGHT HERE, MAN.
LISTEN UP.

95
00:05:25,005 --> 00:05:27,242
IF YOU LIKE ME, YOU GONNA LOVE
THIS GUY!

96
00:05:27,242 --> 00:05:29,542
HE LIKE ME PART TWO!

97
00:05:29,542 --> 00:05:32,208
>> WELL, NO, ERIC.
REMEMBER THE PLAN.

98
00:05:32,208 --> 00:05:34,463
>> OH, OH, YEAH I GOT YOU.
I GOT YOU.

99
00:05:34,463 --> 00:05:36,864
I, ERIC ADAMS, ENDORSE HIM,

100
00:05:36,928 --> 00:05:39,194
ZORDAN MAMAGRAMMA.

101
00:05:39,956 --> 00:05:42,377
>> NO, NO, NO THANK YOU.

102
00:05:42,377 --> 00:05:46,424
>> MR. MAMDANI, YOUR MESSAGE TO
UNDECIDED VOTERS?

103
00:05:46,424 --> 00:05:49,353
>> MY MESSAGE IS THIS.

104
00:05:51,473 --> 00:05:55,386
HEY, GIRL.
I KNOW YOU GOT A LITTLE WHITE
GUILT

105
00:05:55,386 --> 00:05:58,552
FOR GENTRIFYING THAT
SPANISH NEIGHBORHOOD, DON'T YOU?

106
00:05:58,552 --> 00:06:00,509
WHY DON'T YOU VOTE FOR ME?

107
00:06:00,509 --> 00:06:03,548
YOU KNOW YOU'LL FEEL A LITTLE
LESS BAD ABOUT THAT CHICKEN AND
RICE SHOP

108
00:06:03,548 --> 00:06:05,902
GETTING TURNED INTO A
SWEETGREENS.

109
00:06:05,902 --> 00:06:08,973
WHY DON'T YOU HIT ME UP AT THE
BALLOT BOX, GIRL?

110
00:06:12,122 --> 00:06:14,494
>> MR. MAMDANI,

111
00:06:14,494 --> 00:06:18,033
YOU WERE WARNED
THAT THIS IS THE FORUM FOR YOUR
TIKTOKRY.

112
00:06:18,033 --> 00:06:22,686
MR. SLIWA, WHY SHOULD NEW
YORKERS VOTE FOR YOU?

113
00:06:22,686 --> 00:06:25,356
>> IT'S SIMPLE.
I'M THE ONLY CANDIDATE HERE

114
00:06:25,356 --> 00:06:28,830
WHO'S BEEN DANGLED WE MY
TESTICLES OVER THE VERAZZANO BRIDGE

115
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:32,649
BY A LITTLE-KNOWN GANG
CALLED THE LORDS OF FLATBUSH.

116
00:06:32,649 --> 00:06:37,751
I WAS ALSO POURED INTO THE
FOUNDATION OF GIANTS STADIUM AND
CRAWLED MY WAY OUT.

117
00:06:37,751 --> 00:06:40,639
JUST ON MY WAY HERE, I WAS
EJACULATED UPON

118
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:45,353
DINER
SPIDER

119
00:06:46,508 --> 00:06:50,515
JUST ON YOUR WAY HERE?

120
00:06:50,515 --> 00:06:52,226
ALL RIGHT, LET'S MOVE ON.

121
00:06:52,226 --> 00:06:56,104
FROM CONGESTION PRICING TO
HOMELESSNESS TO I.C.E. RAIDS,

122
00:06:56,104 --> 00:06:58,432
THERE ARE MANY ISSUES FACING OUR
CITY.

123
00:06:58,432 --> 00:07:02,289
WHAT DO YOU THINK IS THE BIGGEST
PROBLEM YOU HAVE TO CONFRONT AS
MAYOR?

124
00:07:02,289 --> 00:07:04,664
>> IT'S ME!

125
00:07:04,664 --> 00:07:09,138
YES.
THEY CAN PRETEND THIS ELECTION
IS ABOUT HOUSING AND TAXES,

126
00:07:09,138 --> 00:07:11,089
BUT
WE ALL KNOW IT'S ABOUT ME,
RIGHT?

127
00:07:11,089 --> 00:07:14,350
BECAUSE I'M GOING TO BE VERY
INVOLVED, VERY HANDS-ON.

128
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:17,465
THIS GUY KNOWS ABOUT HANDS ON,
RIGHT, CUOMO?

129
00:07:17,465 --> 00:07:19,310
>> HEY-YO, YOU GOT ME.

130
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:22,612
>> LOOK AT THESE CANDIDATES WE
GOT.
LOOK AT CURTIS SLIWA.

131
00:07:22,612 --> 00:07:24,515
I LOVE HIM, BUT WE'VE GOT TO DO
SOMETHING

132
00:07:24,515 --> 00:07:27,312
ABOUT THAT "EMILY IN
PARIS" LOOKING HAT, RIGHT?

133
00:07:27,312 --> 00:07:29,672
HE'S MY "RUSHMORE" MAX!

134
00:07:29,672 --> 00:07:35,171
AND THE FRONT-RUNNER ZORA
MAMDANI.

135
00:07:35,172 --> 00:07:39,942
MCKENZEY

136
00:07:39,942 --> 00:07:42,596
HE'S TOO YOUNG TO LEAD, FOLKS,
HE'S TOO YOUNG.

137
00:07:42,596 --> 00:07:44,758
HE DOESN'T HAVE THE WOBBLY WALK.

138
00:07:44,758 --> 00:07:48,396
OR FRANKLY THE MIND I HAVE.
GOOD BRAIN.

139
00:07:48,396 --> 00:07:53,059
I TOOK A COGNITIVE TEST.
I DID SO WELL ON MY COGNITIVE TEST

140
00:07:53,059 --> 00:07:56,321
THAT THEY IMMEDIATELY GAVE
ME AN MRI.

141
00:07:56,321 --> 00:07:59,545
THEY SAID THEY'D NEVER SEEN
ANYTHING LIKE IT.

142
00:07:59,545 --> 00:08:04,113
BUT IN TERMS OF ELECTION, I'D
LIKE TO GO BACK TO THAT VERY
IMPORTANT QUESTION.

143
00:08:04,113 --> 00:08:09,068
THE BAGEL.
MY GO-TO BAGEL ORDER IS BIG MAC
WITH A HOLE IN THE MIDDLE.

144
00:08:09,068 --> 00:08:13,559
AND I MAY NOT LIVE IN NEW YORK
ANYMORE, AWW!

145
00:08:14,646 --> 00:08:18,822
BUT I'M ALWAYS WATCHING.
LURKING IN THE SHADOWS.

146
00:08:18,822 --> 00:08:22,634
MUCH LIKE THE LATE, GREAT
PHANTOM OF THE OPERA.

147
00:08:22,634 --> 00:08:24,927
TERRIBLE, WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM
IN TERMS OF OPERA

148
00:08:24,927 --> 00:08:28,848
AND WITH
REGARD TO BEING BURNED BY
CHANDELIER.

149
00:08:28,848 --> 00:08:34,239
PERHAPS I'LL ADD "NEW YORK
MAYOR" TO MY LIST OF DUTIES.

150
00:08:34,239 --> 00:08:35,399
COME ON.

151
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:37,674
¶ OPEN UP YOUR MIND

152
00:08:37,674 --> 00:08:41,058
LET YOUR FANTASIES UNWIND ¶

153
00:08:41,058 --> 00:08:44,128
¶ IN THIS DARKNESS WHICH YOU KNOW

154
00:08:44,128 --> 00:08:47,728
YOU CANNOT FIND ¶

155
00:08:47,728 --> 00:08:49,862
¶ THE DARKNESS OF

156
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:55,633
THE MUSIC OF THE NIGHT ¶

157
00:08:55,633 --> 00:09:00,410
AND LIVE FROM NEW YORK, IT'S
SATURDAY NIGHT!

158
00:11:02,785 --> 00:11:08,206
MUSICAL

159
00:11:08,206 --> 00:11:12,506
HOST

160
00:11:14,905 --> 00:11:20,482
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN -- MILES
TELLER!

161
00:11:37,707 --> 00:11:40,583
>> THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK
YOU VERY MUCH.

162
00:11:40,583 --> 00:11:44,019
I AM SO HAPPY TO BE BACK HOSTING
SNL.

163
00:11:44,019 --> 00:11:45,420
THE LAST TIME --

164
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:48,163
THANK YOU.

165
00:11:48,163 --> 00:11:50,841
THE LAST TIME I HOSTED WAS IN
2022.

166
00:11:50,841 --> 00:11:54,721
IT MEANS A LOT TO BE HERE FOR
ME, ESPECIALLY ON HALLOWEEN
WEEKEND.

167
00:11:54,721 --> 00:11:58,932
YEAH, BECAUSE WHEN I WAS A KID,
ME AND MY SISTERS

168
00:11:58,932 --> 00:12:01,940
USED TO GO
TRICK-OR-TREATING AS "SNL"
CHARACTERS.

169
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:04,657
SO I DON'T KNOW IF YOU REMEMBER
THE NIGHT OF THE ROCKSBURY GUYS.

170
00:12:04,657 --> 00:12:07,833
THEY'RE THE BEST.
WILL FERRELL, CHRIS McCANN.

171
00:12:10,618 --> 00:12:14,424
WHERE ARE THEY?
THERE THEY ARE.

172
00:12:15,204 --> 00:12:17,718
WE WENT AS THEM ONE YEAR,

173
00:12:17,718 --> 00:12:21,306
AND HERE'S A PHOTO OF ME AND MY
SISTERS.

174
00:12:26,307 --> 00:12:31,547
I MEAN, HONESTLY, I'M JUST NOW
REALIZING HOW FAR OFF WE WERE
WITH THAT LOOK.

175
00:12:31,547 --> 00:12:34,689
IT'S LIKE WE JUST LOOK LIKE
LITTLE GREEK MEN.

176
00:12:34,689 --> 00:12:37,090
IT MUST HAVE BEEN SO CONFUSING,

177
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:39,961
ME AND MY SISTERS GOING UP TO
DOORS JUST LIKE --

178
00:12:46,881 --> 00:12:50,140
BUT GROWING UP, I MOVED AROUND A
LOT.

179
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:54,797
SO "SNL" HAS ALWAYS BEEN ONE OF
THE MORE CONSISTENT PARTS OF MY
LIFE.

180
00:12:54,797 --> 00:12:59,492
I LIVED IN PENNSYLVANIA,
GEORGIA, DELAWARE, JERSEY, AND
FLORIDA.

181
00:12:59,492 --> 00:13:01,016
ALL BEFORE I WAS 12.

182
00:13:01,016 --> 00:13:04,309
SO HONESTLY, IT GETS A BIT
CONFUSING

183
00:13:04,309 --> 00:13:06,783
WHEN PEOPLE ASK ME
WHERE I'M FROM.

184
00:13:06,783 --> 00:13:09,829
I'M LIKE, I DON'T KNOW, MAN,
TOP GUN 2?

185
00:13:09,829 --> 00:13:12,353
WHERE ARE YOU FROM?

186
00:13:12,353 --> 00:13:14,717
BUT THAT'S WHY I LOVE COMING
HERE.

187
00:13:14,717 --> 00:13:16,763
BECAUSE I HAVE A LOT OF
MEMORIES.

188
00:13:16,763 --> 00:13:20,410
LIKE RIGHT THERE.
THAT'S WHERE I HAD MY FIRST
BEER.

189
00:13:20,476 --> 00:13:24,080
NOT EVER.
JUST LIKE TODAY.

190
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:27,740
AND OVER THERE.
OH, THAT'S WHERE I ALMOST FELL
GETTING OUT OF MY COSTUME.

191
00:13:27,855 --> 00:13:30,421
AND RIGHT THERE, THAT'S WHERE BOWEN SAID,

192
00:13:30,421 --> 00:13:33,835
"MILES, YOU PROBABLY
FELL BECAUSE YOU HAD SO MANY
BEERS."

193
00:13:33,835 --> 00:13:35,538
I JUST LOVE MEMORIES.

194
00:13:35,538 --> 00:13:37,769
REALLY NICE JUST TO REFLECT.

195
00:13:37,769 --> 00:13:41,683
BUT HONESTLY, GUYS, I'M SO HAPPY
TO BE HERE WITH ALL OF YOU.

196
00:13:41,683 --> 00:13:44,494
A LOT HAS HAPPENED SINCE THE
LAST TIME THAT I HOSTED.

197
00:13:44,494 --> 00:13:48,197
A FEW MONTHS AGO, MY WIFE AND I
LOST OUR HOUSE IN THE PALISADES
FIRE.

198
00:13:48,197 --> 00:13:50,500
BUT DON'T WORRY.
SERIOUSLY, DO NOT WORRY.

199
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:53,095
WE'RE DOING GREAT.
I SEE YOU UP THERE, BABY.

200
00:13:53,095 --> 00:13:56,354
BUT THAT EXPERIENCE HAS MADE ME
INCREDIBLY GRATEFUL

201
00:13:56,354 --> 00:13:59,235
TO HAVE SO
MANY PLACES THAT I CAN CALL
HOME.

202
00:13:59,235 --> 00:14:03,213
BUT BASED ON WHAT HAPPENED TO
THE LAST PLACE THAT I CALLED HOME,

203
00:14:03,213 --> 00:14:05,033
I JUST WANT TO SAY --

204
00:14:05,033 --> 00:14:08,254
THERE'S FIRE EXITS LOCATED
THERE, THERE, THERE.

205
00:14:08,254 --> 00:14:09,616
WE GOT TWO IN THE BACK.

206
00:14:09,616 --> 00:14:11,798
THANK YOU, GUYS.
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A GREAT
SHOW.

207
00:14:11,798 --> 00:14:13,417
BRANDI

208
00:14:13,417 --> 00:14:16,309
STICK

209
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:38,449
>>> IT'S "WHAT DID I DO LAST
NIGHT?"

210
00:14:38,449 --> 00:14:41,098
AND HERE'S YOUR HOST.

211
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:47,159
>> HELLO.
HELLO, HELLO, HELLO.

212
00:14:47,159 --> 00:14:49,178
I AM YOUR HOST, GAY FOPAY.

213
00:14:49,178 --> 00:14:54,627
AND WELCOME BACK TO "WHAT DID I
DO LAST NIGHT?"

214
00:14:54,627 --> 00:14:57,799
THE ONLY GAME SHOW WHERE THREE
DEEPLY HUNGOVER CONTESTANTS

215
00:14:57,799 --> 00:15:01,101
HAVE
TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THEY GOT UP
TO THE NIGHT BEFORE.

216
00:15:01,101 --> 00:15:05,716
AND OF COURSE, TODAY IS OUR
EXTRA-PAINFUL DAY AFTER
HALLOWEEN EDITION.

217
00:15:05,716 --> 00:15:07,845
LET'S MEET OUR PLAYERS.

218
00:15:08,668 --> 00:15:12,004
>> OH, GOD, TURN IT DOWN.

219
00:15:12,004 --> 00:15:15,370
>> FIRST UP WE'VE GOT KENNETH
FROM NEW JERSEY.

220
00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:18,659
HELLO, KENNETH.
OH, MAN, STINKS OVER HERE.

221
00:15:18,659 --> 00:15:22,346
>> YEAH, I CLAWED THE CASTLE
LAST NIGHT.
>> WHAT'S THAT?

222
00:15:22,346 --> 00:15:26,177
>> WHEN YOU DRANK 14 WHITE CLAWS
AND EAT WHITE CASTLE.

223
00:15:26,177 --> 00:15:28,648
>> YOU GOT A DEATH WISH,
BROTHER.

224
00:15:28,648 --> 00:15:32,148
NEXT WE HAVE ELIZABETH FROM NEW
MEXICO.

225
00:15:32,148 --> 00:15:35,020
WHAT WAS YOUR COSTUME?
>> SEXY CAT.

226
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:37,861
>> I'M SURE IT STARTED THAT WAY.

227
00:15:37,861 --> 00:15:41,638
IF YOU WERE AT THE SHELTER,
YOU'D BE PUT DOWN, GIRL.

228
00:15:41,638 --> 00:15:45,911
AND YOUR NAME IS RONDELL FROM
WHERE?

229
00:15:45,911 --> 00:15:48,857
>> RON FROM DELAWARE.

230
00:15:48,857 --> 00:15:52,575
I WAS SHAKING WHEN I WROTE THAT.
>> YEAH, OKAY.

231
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:54,752
LOUIS, TELL THEM WHAT THEY'RE
PLAYING FOR.

232
00:15:54,752 --> 00:15:56,696
>> TODAY'S GRAND PRIZE IS

233
00:15:56,696 --> 00:15:59,603
A LARGE PEDIALYTE AND A BACON, EGG
AND CHEESE.

234
00:15:59,603 --> 00:16:02,638
>> MY GOD.
>> I NEED THAT.

235
00:16:02,638 --> 00:16:05,361
>> I NEED THAT NOW.
I NEED THAT.

236
00:16:05,361 --> 00:16:07,625
>> WELL, YOU CAN HAVE IT IF YOU
WIN.

237
00:16:07,625 --> 00:16:11,855
KENNETH, YOU'RE UP FIRST.
WHAT WAS YOUR UBER FAUX PAS?

238
00:16:11,855 --> 00:16:15,201
WAS IT "A," A LITTLE PUKE?

239
00:16:15,201 --> 00:16:20,116
B, MAJOR MADE YOUR DRIVER GO
THROUGH THE DRIVE-THRU AND PAY
FOR YOUR FOOD?

240
00:16:20,116 --> 00:16:25,037
OR "C," ASKED FOR THE AUX THEN
WATCHED PORN?

241
00:16:26,722 --> 00:16:30,768
>> KNOWING MYSELF, I'D SAY I
PUKED IN THE UBER.

242
00:16:30,768 --> 00:16:34,511
>> OH, SO CLOSE.
THAT WAS ACTUALLY A TRICK
QUESTION.

243
00:16:34,511 --> 00:16:37,268
YOU DID PUKE, BUT IT WASN'T IN
AN UBER.

244
00:16:37,268 --> 00:16:41,164
YOU JUST SAW A GUY IN A CAMRY,
AND YOU GOT IN.

245
00:16:41,164 --> 00:16:44,619
>> IN MY DEFENSE, I DO THAT A
LOT.

246
00:16:44,619 --> 00:16:47,369
>> DOESN'T MATTER.
YOUR PENALTY IS --

247
00:16:47,369 --> 00:16:50,390
LISTENING TO
MY NEPHEW, ANDRE, LEARN THE SAX.

248
00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:51,808
>> NO.

249
00:16:53,083 --> 00:16:57,169
>> STOP!
>> NO, NO!

250
00:16:59,202 --> 00:17:02,610
>> ALL RIGHT.
NEXT UP, ELIZABETH.

251
00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:06,695
YOUR QUESTION IS, WHO DID YOU
BITE, AND WHERE DID YOU BITE
THEM?

252
00:17:06,695 --> 00:17:09,795
>> I BIT SOMEONE?
>> YOU MOST CERTAINLY DID.

253
00:17:09,795 --> 00:17:13,985
AND YOUR CHOICES ARE, "A," YOUR
FRIEND JENNA IN THE NECK.

254
00:17:13,985 --> 00:17:17,038
B, YOURSELF ON THE TONGUE.

255
00:17:17,038 --> 00:17:20,906
OR "C," THE BOUNCER ON THE
NIPPLE.

256
00:17:20,906 --> 00:17:25,835
>> OH, OH -- MY TONGUE HURTS
TODAY, SO I'M THINKING "B,"
MYSELF.

257
00:17:25,835 --> 00:17:29,727
>> NO.
THE ANSWER WAS, ALL OF THE
ABOVE.

258
00:17:29,727 --> 00:17:34,953
AND YOUR PERSONALITY IS,
CATCHING UP WITH AN ACQUAINTANCE
FROM HIGH SCHOOL.

259
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:40,658
>> HEY, I'M SURE YOU HEARD, BUT
THINGS HAVEN'T BEEN GOING GREAT
FOR ME.

260
00:17:40,658 --> 00:17:43,326
THANKS FOR AGREEING TO HELP ME
MOVE.

261
00:17:43,326 --> 00:17:46,054
>> NOOOOO!

262
00:17:46,054 --> 00:17:49,417
>> ALL RIGHT, NOW RON, YOUR
QUESTION INCLUDES A VIDEO CLUE.

263
00:17:49,417 --> 00:17:52,527
THIS IS SECURITY FOOTAGE OF YOU
AT THE ATM LAST NIGHT.

264
00:17:52,527 --> 00:17:53,698
>> OH GOD.

265
00:17:53,698 --> 00:17:55,790
>> LOUIS, LET'S ROLL THE TAPE.

266
00:17:55,790 --> 00:17:59,418
>> THE MONEY MACHINE, THE MONEY
MACHINE.

267
00:17:59,418 --> 00:18:02,406
CAN'T YOU GET MONEY FOR FREE?

268
00:18:02,406 --> 00:18:04,647
DRY HEAVING

269
00:18:05,047 --> 00:18:07,136
BATHROOM

270
00:18:07,136 --> 00:18:08,972
OH, LOOK AT HIM GO!

271
00:18:09,261 --> 00:18:12,738
>> HELLO!
I NEED $400.

272
00:18:14,257 --> 00:18:18,821
>> OH A LITTLE CAMEO FROM
ELIZABETH AS SHE BIT YOU.

273
00:18:18,821 --> 00:18:21,210
SORRY, A LOT OF TROUBLE THERE.

274
00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:23,706
>> WHAT'S YOUR QUESTION, MAN?

275
00:18:23,706 --> 00:18:25,719
>> NO QUESTION.

276
00:18:25,719 --> 00:18:28,114
I JUST WANTED TO MAKE YOU WATCH
THAT CLIP.

277
00:18:28,114 --> 00:18:31,639
BUT YOUR PRIZE FOR WATCHING IT
IS A CHAIR.

278
00:18:31,639 --> 00:18:33,299
WHY DON'T YOU TAKE A SEAT, RON?

279
00:18:33,299 --> 00:18:37,164
>> OH, THANK GOD.
OH, MY GOD, THAT'S HUGE.

280
00:18:37,164 --> 00:18:41,384
THIS CHANGES EVERYTHING.
OH, THAT'S SO HUGE.

281
00:18:42,937 --> 00:18:47,371
>> ALL RIGHT, KENNETH, FOR AN
OPPORTUNITY TO STEAL THE CHAIR --

282
00:18:47,371 --> 00:18:50,898
WHICH OF THESE
INDIVIDUALS GAVE YOU THAT BLACK
EYE?

283
00:18:50,898 --> 00:18:54,485
WAS IT "A," THIS OLDER WOMAN?

284
00:18:54,485 --> 00:18:57,642
B, THIS LITTLE BOY?

285
00:18:57,642 --> 00:19:01,046
OR "C," A STOP SIGN?

286
00:19:02,873 --> 00:19:04,898
>> UH -- I MEAN, NONE OF THEM
ARE GOOD.

287
00:19:04,898 --> 00:19:08,205
BUT -- I GUESS I'LL SAY THE
LADY.

288
00:19:08,205 --> 00:19:10,948
>> NO.
THE LITTLE BOY.

289
00:19:10,948 --> 00:19:13,034
YOU STOLE HIS COSTUME.

290
00:19:13,034 --> 00:19:17,175
>> I WAS WONDERING WHY I WAS
DRESSED AS A CORN.
OKAY.

291
00:19:17,175 --> 00:19:18,946
>> ALL RIGHT.

292
00:19:20,523 --> 00:19:24,255
LAST UP IS ELIZABETH FOR A
CHANCE AT THE GRAND PRIZE.

293
00:19:24,255 --> 00:19:26,755
THE BACON, EGG AND CHEESE

294
00:19:26,755 --> 00:19:29,258
AND THE PEDIALYTE.

295
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:32,822
>> WHO DID YOU MAKE OUT WITH
LAST NIGHT?

296
00:19:32,822 --> 00:19:35,541
SAME OPTIONS AS BEFORE.

297
00:19:36,207 --> 00:19:41,280
OLD LADY, LITTLE BOY, STOP SIGN.

298
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,507
>> I WOKE UP WITH A CHIPPED
TOOTH.
GOT TO BE THE STOP SIGN.

299
00:19:44,507 --> 00:19:48,373
>> THAT IS RIGHT, YOU TRASH CAT,
GET OVER HERE.

300
00:19:48,674 --> 00:19:51,049
OH, WELL, THAT'S OUR TIME FOR
TODAY.

301
00:19:51,049 --> 00:19:54,383
I AM GAY FOPAY.
THANKS FOR WATCHING.

302
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:05,581
>>> THIS WEEK ON A VERY SPECIAL
EPISODE OF "PROPERTY BROTHERS."

303
00:20:05,581 --> 00:20:08,101
>> I'M DREW SCOTT, AND I'M A
REAL ESTATE EXPERT.

304
00:20:08,101 --> 00:20:10,760
>> I'M HIS TWIN BROTHER
JONATHAN, AND I'M A CONTRACTOR.

305
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:13,161
THAT MEANS I FIND THE PERFECT
PROPERTY --

306
00:20:13,161 --> 00:20:16,322
>> AND I ACTUALLY HAVE TO
RENOVATE THE DARN THING.

307
00:20:16,681 --> 00:20:19,452
>> THIS WEEK, WE'RE TAKING ON
OUR BIGGEST CHALLENGE YET --

308
00:20:19,452 --> 00:20:22,688
>> BUILDING THE NEW WHITE HOUSE
BALLROOM.

309
00:20:22,688 --> 00:20:25,861
- HI. THE PROPERTY BROTHERS.
- NICE.

310
00:20:25,861 --> 00:20:30,294
SO WHICH ONE OF YOU MARRIED THE
NEW GIRL, AND WHICH ONE OF YOU'S
THE GAY?

311
00:20:30,294 --> 00:20:31,951
>> I MARRIED THE NEW GIRL.

312
00:20:31,951 --> 00:20:35,135
>> DONALD AND MELANIA MOVED INTO
THIS HOUSE NINE YEARS AGO.

313
00:20:35,135 --> 00:20:38,269
THEY WERE EVICTED FOR FOUR
YEARS, BUT THEY MOVED BACK IN.

314
00:20:38,269 --> 00:20:41,259
DONALD HAS A STRONG EYE FOR
INTERIOR DESIGN.

315
00:20:41,259 --> 00:20:44,208
>> I PUT THESE GOLD URNS
EVERYWHERE.

316
00:20:44,208 --> 00:20:45,989
LIKE A HUNDRED IN EVERY ROOM.

317
00:20:45,989 --> 00:20:49,630
THAT MAKES ME HAPPY.
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO BE HAPPY
THESE DAYS.

318
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:52,768
REALLY DARK STUFF HAPPENING IN
THE WORLD.
SOME OF IT ME.

319
00:20:52,768 --> 00:20:57,385
AND HERE'S A CROWN I JUST GOT
FROM MY TRIP TO ASIA.

320
00:20:57,385 --> 00:21:00,557
NOTHING SAYS DEMOCRACY LIKE A
CROWN, RIGHT?

321
00:21:00,557 --> 00:21:03,774
>> AND HIS WIFE, MELANIA, SHE'S
GOT A STYLE ALL HER OWN.

322
00:21:03,774 --> 00:21:06,402
>> I LOVE THIS HALLOWEEN
DECORATIONS YOU PUT UP.

323
00:21:06,402 --> 00:21:09,088
>> THAT'S FOR CHRISTMAS.

324
00:21:09,389 --> 00:21:13,192
>> THE TRUMPS HAVE ALREADY MADE
A FEW SUBTLE CHANGES TO THE
HOUSE.

325
00:21:13,193 --> 00:21:16,122
FDR

326
00:21:16,122 --> 00:21:20,422
AND PUT A PAINTING OF
HIMSELF AS A SOLDIER FROM
HALO.

327
00:21:20,423 --> 00:21:22,111
LEARNED

328
00:21:22,111 --> 00:21:24,871
YOU KNOW YOU CAN'T SAY MASTER
CHIEF ANYMORE.
RIGHT?

329
00:21:24,871 --> 00:21:26,611
YOU'VE GOT TO SAY PRIMARY CHIEF.

330
00:21:26,611 --> 00:21:29,738
>> THEY ALSO PAVED THE ROSE
GARDEN AND TURNED IT INTO WHAT LOOKS LIKE

331
00:21:29,738 --> 00:21:31,506
OUTER SEATING AT AN
OLIVE GARDEN.

332
00:21:31,506 --> 00:21:34,636
DONALD AND MELANIA STILL FEEL
LIKE SOMETHING'S MISSING.

333
00:21:34,636 --> 00:21:37,754
>> THE HOUSE IS ONLY 55,000
SQUARE FEET.

334
00:21:37,754 --> 00:21:39,720
AND 132 ROOMS.

335
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:41,332
>> WE NEED MORE SPACE!

336
00:21:41,332 --> 00:21:43,784
RIGHT?
WE NEED MORE SPACE!

337
00:21:43,784 --> 00:21:47,457
>> WE NEED A BALLROOM BECAUSE
DONALD, HE LOVES TO DANCE.

338
00:21:47,457 --> 00:21:49,857
>> I'M A TERRIFIC DANCER.
TERRIFIC DANCER.

339
00:21:49,857 --> 00:21:52,712
JUST ASK YOUR EYES.

340
00:21:54,134 --> 00:21:56,215
>> WE ASKED DONALD WHAT HIS
BUDGET WAS,

341
00:21:56,215 --> 00:21:59,483
AND HE SAID BETWEEN
$350 MILLION AND INFINITY.

342
00:21:59,483 --> 00:22:01,541
THEN WE ASKED IF HE NEEDED A PERMIT,

343
00:22:01,541 --> 00:22:03,189
AND DONALD LAUGHED
REALLY HARD.

344
00:22:03,189 --> 00:22:07,728
HE SAID, I COULD BUILD THIS
BALLROOM WITH THE BONES OF MY ENEMIES,
AND NO ONE COULD STOP ME,

345
00:22:07,728 --> 00:22:10,279
AS OPPOSED TO A BONEHEAD
LIKE MY BROTHER.

346
00:22:10,279 --> 00:22:11,887
>> OH, YOU HUSH UP.

347
00:22:12,506 --> 00:22:16,630
>> WE SHOWED DONALD OUR PLAN FOR
A BALLROOM THAT WOULD MATCH THE
CURRENT PROPORTIONS,

348
00:22:16,630 --> 00:22:18,385
BUT HE KEPT
CLICKING "ENLARGE."

349
00:22:18,386 --> 00:22:20,584
FENCE
STREET

350
00:22:20,584 --> 00:22:21,720
>> THEY CAN DRIVE AROUND IT.

351
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:24,646
OH, I WANT A RING FOR MMA
FIGHTS.

352
00:22:24,646 --> 00:22:28,922
OFFICIAL ONES BUT ALSO CASUAL
FIGHTS IN THE BACKYARD, YOU KNOW
WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT?

353
00:22:28,922 --> 00:22:31,970
TWO MENTALLY ILL GUYS JUST
WHALING ON EACH OTHER.

354
00:22:31,970 --> 00:22:33,567
DO BUM FIGHTS AGAIN.

355
00:22:33,567 --> 00:22:36,287
REMEMBER BUM FIGHTS?
WE LOVE BUM FIGHTS!

356
00:22:36,287 --> 00:22:40,562
>> TO NAIL DOWN THE STYLE OF THE
BALLROOM, WE ASKED DONALD TO
COME UP WITH A BOARD.

357
00:22:40,562 --> 00:22:43,059
>> THIS KIND OF GUY AND THIS GUY --

358
00:22:43,059 --> 00:22:45,068
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE
MET HIM, BUT HE'S A GREAT GUY.

359
00:22:45,068 --> 00:22:47,914
THEN SOMETHING LIKE THIS COULD
ALSO BE NICE.

360
00:22:47,914 --> 00:22:50,274
>> I TOLD DONALD OUR NUMBER ONE PRIORITY

361
00:22:50,274 --> 00:22:52,740
WAS TO PRESERVE THE
HISTORIC NATURE OF THE BUILDING.

362
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:55,241
HE SENT ME BACK THIS GIF.

363
00:22:55,241 --> 00:22:59,334
WE DEMOLISHED THE ENTIRE EAST
WING IN TWO DAYS.

364
00:23:01,066 --> 00:23:04,733
WITH THE GOVERNMENT STILL SHUT
DOWN AND SO MANY WORKERS FURLOUGHED,

365
00:23:04,733 --> 00:23:08,772
WE WERE ABLE TO
FORCE PARK RANGERS AND
ASTRONAUTS TO DO A LOT OF THE
CHEM DEMOLITION.

366
00:23:08,772 --> 00:23:11,768
>> WERE YOU SAD TO LOSE THE
HISTORIC PRESIDENTIAL MOVIE
THEATER?

367
00:23:11,768 --> 00:23:14,589
BILL CLINTON CALLED IT THE BEST
PERK OF BEING PRESIDENT.

368
00:23:14,589 --> 00:23:15,884
>> BILL CLINTON SAID THAT?

369
00:23:15,884 --> 00:23:20,579
HE SAID THE BEST PERK FOR HIM
WAS THE MOVIE THEATER?

370
00:23:20,579 --> 00:23:23,654
>> UNFORTUNATELY THE RENOVATION
HIT A BIT OF A SNAG

371
00:23:23,654 --> 00:23:26,899
WHEN DONALD
REALIZED HE HAD DEPORTED ALL THE
CONSTRUCTION WORKERS

372
00:23:26,899 --> 00:23:29,844
I PULLED
INTO THE HOME DEPOT PARKING LOT
AND YELLED,

373
00:23:29,844 --> 00:23:31,775
"JUST GIVE ME THE
WHITES."

374
00:23:31,775 --> 00:23:35,053
I WANT THE DAY LABORERS FROM
NORWAY AND SWEDEN,

375
00:23:35,053 --> 00:23:37,344
BUT
APPARENTLY THEY DON'T EXIST.

376
00:23:37,344 --> 00:23:39,921
>> BUT IN THE END, WE'RE
CONFIDENT THE NEW BALLROOM

377
00:23:39,921 --> 00:23:43,019
WILL BE A SHINING BEACON OF FREEDOM
FOR ALL AMERICANS.

378
00:23:43,019 --> 00:23:45,891
>> AND IT WILL BE READY JUST IN
TIME FOR MY THIRD TERM.

379
00:23:45,891 --> 00:23:49,117
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
WE WANT THIS TO BE OUR FOREVER
HOME.

380
00:23:49,117 --> 00:23:50,588
>> YES, BECAUSE WE'RE NOT
LEAVING.

381
00:23:50,588 --> 00:23:52,590
WE'RE GOING TO BE DOING
SOMETHING CALLED COUP.

382
00:23:52,590 --> 00:23:55,884
>> AND WE'LL MAKE SURE THAT
TRUMP'S DREAM BECOMES A REALITY.

383
00:23:55,884 --> 00:23:58,535
IF MY DUMB BROTHER DOESN'T SCREW
IT UP.

384
00:23:58,535 --> 00:24:01,211
>> SERIOUSLY?
[ BLEEP ] YOU.

385
00:24:02,728 --> 00:24:04,924
>> THANK YOU SO MUCH.

386
00:24:04,924 --> 00:24:07,534
>> OKAY, I GUESS THE ONLY THING
LEFT IS THE PAYMENT FOR THE
CONSTRUCTION.

387
00:24:07,534 --> 00:24:10,466
>> AREN'T YOU GUYS FROM CANADA?
>> YEAH.

388
00:24:10,466 --> 00:24:12,368
>> I.C.E.!

389
00:24:12,368 --> 00:24:15,193
THERE GOES I.C.E.
WE LIKE THEM.
BIG AT I.C.E.

390
00:24:15,193 --> 00:24:16,909
>> SPOOKY.
>> VERY SPOOKY.

391
00:24:16,909 --> 00:24:18,903
IT'S A VERY SPOOKY SECRET
POLICE THING.

392
00:24:18,903 --> 00:24:23,426
>> "PROPERTY BROTHERS."
ONLY ON HGTV AND TRUTH SOCIAL.

393
00:24:50,731 --> 00:24:54,320
>>> GENTLEMEN, THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR COMING IN TO DO THESE PROMOS

394
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:57,066
FOR THE NATIONAL HOCKEY LEAGUE'S
COMMUNITY OUTREACH DAY.

395
00:24:57,066 --> 00:25:00,234
>> WE'RE SO GLAD TO HAVE PLAYERS
FROM THE NEW YORK RANGERS,

396
00:25:00,234 --> 00:25:02,750
THE
L.A. KINGS, AND THE NASHVILLE
PREDATORS.

397
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:04,478
>> MY NAME IS DIDIER LEREW.

398
00:25:04,478 --> 00:25:06,325
>> I JUST GO BY MIDGE.

399
00:25:06,325 --> 00:25:11,162
>> YOU MAY KNOW US FROM SUCH
WORKS AS THE SECOND IT LAYING OF
THE J.G. WENTWORTH COMMERCIAL

400
00:25:11,162 --> 00:25:13,363
WHERE THEY SANG ON A BUS.

401
00:25:13,363 --> 00:25:17,033
>> ALL RIGHT.
JUST READ THE LINES, AND WE
SHOULD BE OUT OF HERE IN NO
TIME.

402
00:25:17,033 --> 00:25:19,033
>> ALL RIGHT, AND ACTION!

403
00:25:19,033 --> 00:25:22,754
>> THE NHL IS PROUD OF THE
CHARITY WORK WE DO IN OUR
COMMUNITIES.

404
00:25:22,754 --> 00:25:25,213
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
I MAY BE A KING ON THE ICE,

405
00:25:25,213 --> 00:25:27,504
BUT
I'M ALSO A KING IN THE
COMMUNITY.

406
00:25:27,504 --> 00:25:29,631
>> AND I'M A RANGER IN MY
COMMUNITY.

407
00:25:29,631 --> 00:25:32,156
>> AND I'M A PREDATOR IN MY
COMMUNITY.

408
00:25:32,156 --> 00:25:35,933
WHEN YOU SEE THIS FACE, JUST
KNOW A PREDATOR IS IN THE
COMMUNITY.

409
00:25:35,933 --> 00:25:38,152
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
CAN WE CUT?

410
00:25:38,152 --> 00:25:40,762
>> CUT!
WHAT'S THE ISSUE, MAN?

411
00:25:40,762 --> 00:25:44,322
>> I MEAN, DO I HAVE TO SAY THAT
I'M A PREDATOR IN IN MY
COMMUNITY?

412
00:25:44,322 --> 00:25:47,467
>> WHY NOT?
YOU PLAY FOR THE NASHVILLE
PREDATORS.

413
00:25:47,467 --> 00:25:50,751
>> YEAH, BUT YOU HEAR HOW IT
SOUNDS, RIGHT?

414
00:25:50,751 --> 00:25:55,374
>> OKAY, SO IT'S GOING TO BE ONE
OF THOSE SHOOTS.

415
00:25:55,374 --> 00:25:56,992
DIVA ALERT!

416
00:25:56,992 --> 00:25:58,920
>> MAN.

DID YOU GET AN AVAIL CHECK FOR A
JUSTIN LONG CHOBANI COMMERCIAL?

420
00:26:08,818 --> 00:26:11,687
>> I DON'T KNOW WHAT ANY OF THAT
MEANS.

421
00:26:11,687 --> 00:26:13,629
>> YEAH, I DIDN'T THINK SO.

422

DO YOUR JOB AND I'LL DO MY
OPINION, BUD.

>> WHAT IS THE MEANING OF ALL OF
THIS UNPROFESSIONALISM?

429
00:26:37,296 --> 00:26:41,499
>> I MAKE SICK KIDS FEEL
TOUCHED?
I DON'T WANT TO SAY THAT.

430
00:26:41,499 --> 00:26:44,669
>> ARE YOU KIDDING ME, PAL?
DO YOU KNOW WHO YOU'RE TALKING
TO?

00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:20,348
>> YOU DIDN'T DO THE WHOLE
THING.
HERE, READ THIS.

442
00:27:20,348 --> 00:27:21,755
>> OKAY.
FINE.

443
00:27:21,755 --> 00:27:25,564
I'M VISITING THAILAND TO
HOPEFULLY RUB OFF ON SOME KIDS

444
00:27:25,564 --> 00:27:29,705
SO MAYBE ONE DAY THEY BECOME
PREDATORS JUST LIKE ME.

445
00:27:31,071 --> 00:27:33,226
I'M NOT -- I CAN'T SAY THESE
LINES.

446
00:27:33,226 --> 00:27:36,809
>> YOU KNOW WHAT, YOU KNOW WHAT?
THAT'S OKAY.
LET'S GET THE WRITERS IN HERE.

447
00:27:36,809 --> 00:27:39,410
>> SEE IF THEY HAVE ANY OTHER
IDEAS.
>> GOOD.

448
00:27:39,410 --> 00:27:43,269
>> HEY, WRITERS HERE!
WE DON'T HAVE ANY OTHER IDEAS,
DO THE LINES.

449
00:27:43,269 --> 00:27:47,407
>> FOR THIS NEXT ONE, YOU DON'T
HAVE TO SAY ANYTHING.
YOU CAN KEEP THAT PRETTY LITTLE
MOUTH SHUT.

450
00:27:47,407 --> 00:27:51,350
AND THAT'S ON MIDGE.
>> OKAY, FINE.
THAT'S MORE LIKE IT.

451
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:55,932
ALL RIGHT, LET'S GET LIGHTS UP.
START ROLLING.
AND ACTION!

452
00:27:55,932 --> 00:27:59,759
>> WHEN MY CLASSROOM NEEDED
SUPPLIES, THE KINGS STEPPED UP.

453
00:27:59,759 --> 00:28:03,902
>> WHEN MY FATHER GOT SICK, THE
RANGERS HELPED COVER HIS MEDICAL
BILLS.

454
00:28:03,902 --> 00:28:07,403
>> THIS IS THE PREDATOR THAT
FOREVER ALTERED THE COURSE OF MY
LIFE.

455
00:28:07,403 --> 00:28:09,589
>> NO!
NO!

456
00:28:09,589 --> 00:28:12,171
YOU KNOW WHAT?
THIS ISN'T GOING TO WORK.

457
00:28:12,171 --> 00:28:16,132
WHY DON'T YOU ALL SAY YOUR NAME,
YOUR POSITION, AND YOUR TEAM.
LET'S GO.

458
00:28:16,132 --> 00:28:20,453
>> CAN YOU HANDLE THAT, WIDDLE
HOCKEY PLAYER?

459
00:28:21,499 --> 00:28:23,398
>> LET'S ROLL IT.

460
00:28:23,398 --> 00:28:27,088
>> RONNIE ADRIAN, DEFENSEMAN,
KINGS.

461
00:28:27,088 --> 00:28:30,413
>> CHRISTIAN FLASHMAN, GOALIE,
RANGERS.

462
00:28:30,413 --> 00:28:32,447
>> I DON'T WANT TO DO THIS ONE.

463
00:28:32,447 --> 00:28:36,276
>> OH, COME ON.
IT'S JUST YOUR NAME.
>> FINE.

464
00:28:36,276 --> 00:28:39,951
I'M CHASE KIDD, RIGHT WING
PREDATOR.

465
00:28:43,106 --> 00:28:45,793
OKAY, NO, I DID HEAR IT THAT
TIME.

466
00:28:45,793 --> 00:28:48,540
>> AND THAT'S ON MIDGE.

467
00:28:56,743 --> 00:28:58,490
>>> OFFICER, SHE'S GONE.

468
00:28:58,490 --> 00:29:00,060
I'VE LOOKED EVERYWHERE, SHE'S
GONE.

469
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:01,614
>> SIR, CALM DOWN, WHAT HAPPENED
THIS.

470
00:29:01,614 --> 00:29:04,910
>> MY WIFE IS MISSING, MAN,
SOMEBODY MUST HAVE TAKEN HER!

471
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:06,848
>> COMING SOON TO NETFLIX,

472
00:29:06,848 --> 00:29:11,060
THE TRUE STORY OF THREE MEN WHOSE
WIVES MYSTERIOUSLY VANISHED.

473
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:13,786
>> SHE WAS THERE.
AND THEN --

474
00:29:13,786 --> 00:29:16,152
POOF.
SHE'D DISAPPEARED.

475
00:29:16,152 --> 00:29:19,291
>> WE'VE RECEIVED A CALL ABOUT A
MISSING WOMAN ON JORDAN ROAD.

476
00:29:19,291 --> 00:29:21,009
DISPATCHING ALL UNITS.

477
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:22,799
>> IT DIDN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.

478
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:23,996
I'M SORRY, I CAN'T DO THIS.

479
00:29:23,996 --> 00:29:26,816
>> MEGAN!
MEGAN!

480
00:29:26,816 --> 00:29:31,280
>> WITH NEVER-BEFORE-SEEN
INTERVIEWS WITH THE WOMEN
THEMSELVES.

481
00:29:31,473 --> 00:29:33,793
>> SO TELL US WHAT HAPPENED.

482
00:29:34,315 --> 00:29:38,654
>> I WAS ON A BUSINESS TRIP.
I HAD TOLD DOUG ABOUT IT MAYBE
45 TIMES.

483
00:29:38,654 --> 00:29:40,643
>> I WENT TO MY SISTER'S FOR THE WEEKEND,

484
00:29:40,643 --> 00:29:42,327
AS WE HAD DISCUSSED FOR
MONTHS.

485
00:29:42,327 --> 00:29:45,128
>> I WAS LITERALLY IN THE
BATHROOM.

486
00:29:45,128 --> 00:29:48,095
DUMPING IF YOU WANT TO KNOW.

487
00:29:48,095 --> 00:29:50,502
>> "GONE WITHOUT A TRACE."

488
00:29:50,502 --> 00:29:54,214
>> WHOEVER TOOK HER LEFT A BUNCH
OF CRYPTIC NOTES.

489
00:29:54,214 --> 00:29:56,889
>> HEAT AT 450 FOR 20 MINUTES.

490
00:29:56,889 --> 00:29:59,086
PLEASE PUT LAUNDRY IN THE DRYER.

491
00:29:59,086 --> 00:30:01,651
IS THIS A GAME TO YOU?

492
00:30:01,651 --> 00:30:03,806
>> THE WHOLE WORLD WAS AGAINST
ME.

493
00:30:03,806 --> 00:30:05,259
WHAT

494
00:30:05,397 --> 00:30:07,548
WHAT THE HELL DO YOU EAT,
MAN?

495
00:30:07,548 --> 00:30:10,774
>> SHE WAS GONE FOR WHAT FELT
LIKE A LIFETIME.

496
00:30:10,774 --> 00:30:13,263
>> I DID TAKE A SHOWER AFTER.

497
00:30:13,263 --> 00:30:14,605
HAD TO.

498
00:30:14,605 --> 00:30:17,510
>> NO SIGNS.
NO CLUES.

499
00:30:17,510 --> 00:30:18,779
NOTHING.

500
00:30:18,779 --> 00:30:20,162
TRIP

501
00:30:20,162 --> 00:30:23,176
>> IT WAS FUN AT FIRST.

502
00:30:23,904 --> 00:30:28,034
THAT'S WHEN THINGS GOT REALLY
BAD.

503
00:30:30,817 --> 00:30:33,929
BEEN THERE

504
00:30:34,048 --> 00:30:37,416
>> THE POLICE ASKED ME FOR A
PHOTO OF HER, BUT MY PHONE WAS DEAD

505
00:30:37,416 --> 00:30:38,974
SO I HAD TO DRAW HER.

506
00:30:38,974 --> 00:30:42,054
SHE'S JUST AS BEAUTIFUL IN REAL
LIFE.

507
00:30:42,054 --> 00:30:44,717
>> FEEL LIKE I HAVE A LITTLE
MORE OF A CHIN.

508
00:30:44,717 --> 00:30:46,925
>> OKAY, WHAT IS YOUR WIFE'S
FULL NAME?
>> MEGAN.

509
00:30:46,925 --> 00:30:49,883
>> WHEN'S HER BIRTHDAY?
>> SUMMER.

510
00:30:49,883 --> 00:30:54,171
>> DID YOU CONTACT HER PARENTS?
>> YES, I CALLED THEM AND SAID,
YOUR DAUGHTER IS DEAD.

511
00:30:54,172 --> 00:30:56,158
HIGH ALERT

512
00:30:56,158 --> 00:30:58,015
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT I WAS
DOING.

513
00:30:58,015 --> 00:31:00,061
SOMEBODY TOOK MY WIFE!

514
00:31:00,061 --> 00:31:02,817
I HAVE A GUN, AND I'M NOT -- OH!

515
00:31:03,975 --> 00:31:09,013
>> AND NOT LONG AFTER SHE LEFT,
THESE TWO SMALL MEN CAME OUT THE
BASEMENT.

516
00:31:09,013 --> 00:31:11,881
WHAT DO YOU WANT?
WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?

517
00:31:11,881 --> 00:31:14,792
>> OUR SONS.
I THINK YOU FORGOT WE HAVE KIDS.

518
00:31:14,792 --> 00:31:16,708
>> NO, NO!

519
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:19,874
>> AFTER ABOUT 24 HOURS,

520
00:31:19,874 --> 00:31:22,627
I DID DECIDE IT WAS TIME TO MOVE ON
ROMANTICALLY.

521
00:31:22,627 --> 00:31:24,816
SO I DOWNLOADED TINDER.

522
00:31:24,816 --> 00:31:26,546
PREPARED

523
00:31:26,546 --> 00:31:29,156
THERE WAS NO WAY I COULD HAVE
KNOWN.

524
00:31:29,223 --> 00:31:32,748
>> I'M TELLING YOU NOW, I'M
GOING TO SEE MY SISTER IN
POUGHKEEPSIE.

525
00:31:32,748 --> 00:31:33,664
>> OKAY, BABY, HAVE FUN.

526
00:31:33,664 --> 00:31:36,398
>> I'LL BE BACK SUNDAY.
SUNDAY NIGHT.

527
00:31:36,398 --> 00:31:37,480
>> OKAY.

528
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:40,585
>> WHERE AM I GOING?
>> POUGHKEEPSIE.

529
00:31:40,585 --> 00:31:43,036
>> SIR, IS THERE ANY PLACE YOU
THINK SHE COULD BE?

530
00:31:43,036 --> 00:31:45,543
>> I KNOW THIS IS PROBABLY
WRONG, BUT --

531
00:31:45,543 --> 00:31:48,141
MAYBE THE BOOB
STORE?

532
00:31:48,141 --> 00:31:50,912
>> "GONE WITH SEVERAL TRACES."

533
00:31:50,912 --> 00:31:53,623
>> SOMETIMES THE SCARIEST THING
IS WHEN --

534
00:31:53,623 --> 00:31:58,314
STEP BACK, NO!

535
00:32:06,389 --> 00:32:09,043
>>> GOOD EVENING, AND WELCOME TO
NEWSPOINT.

536
00:32:09,043 --> 00:32:10,296
I'M DAPHNE DODD.

537
00:32:10,296 --> 00:32:13,820
MY GUEST TONIGHT IS ECONOMIST
P.L. HENRY.
>> EVENING.

538
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:16,117
>> IF IT LOOKS A LITTLE
DIFFERENT IN HERE,

539
00:32:16,117 --> 00:32:18,732
THAT'S
BECAUSE IT'S OUR FIRST SHOW IN
OUR BRAND-NEW SET

540
00:32:18,732 --> 00:32:21,101
THAT GIVES YOU
A PEEK INSIDE OUR NEWSROOM

541
00:32:21,101 --> 00:32:24,074
AND
THE HARD-WORKING FOLKS WHO PUT
ALL THIS TOGETHER.

542
00:32:24,074 --> 00:32:25,798
WELL, LOTS TO DISCUSS TONIGHT.

543
00:32:25,798 --> 00:32:30,183
WE START WITH THE ECONOMY, WHICH
WE'RE PUTTING "IN FOCUS."

544
00:32:30,577 --> 00:32:34,207
THIS WEEK, AMAZON ANNOUNCED
THOUSANDS OF LAYOFFS

545
00:32:34,207 --> 00:32:39,094
WITH TARGET
ALSO JOINING THE LIST OF MAJOR
COMPANIES SLASHING ITS
WORKFORCE.

546
00:32:39,094 --> 00:32:41,882
WHILE COMPANIES LOOK TO PROTECT
THEIR BOTTOM LINES,

547
00:32:41,882 --> 00:32:45,128
AMERICAN
HOUSEHOLDS ARE DOING THE SAME.

548
00:32:49,287 --> 00:32:51,989
>> ARE YOU OKAY?

549
00:32:51,989 --> 00:32:54,771
>> YEAH, I'M FINE, I'M SORRY.

550
00:32:54,771 --> 00:32:56,547
>> OKAY.

551
00:32:56,547 --> 00:33:00,947
RISING PRICES FOR GROCERIES AND
UTILITIES --

552
00:33:01,745 --> 00:33:05,717
I'M SORRY.
I'M FINE.
I APOLOGIZE.

553
00:33:05,717 --> 00:33:07,502
>> APOLOGIES FOR THAT.

554
00:33:07,502 --> 00:33:12,991
THE BIG QUESTION HERE, IS THIS
THE START OF A LONGER, STEEPER
DECLINE?

555
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:17,681
>> WELL, DAPHNE, THAT'S UP TO
HOW MUCH OF THIS OVERHEATED A.I.
SECTOR IS EVEN REAL.

556
00:33:17,681 --> 00:33:19,935
IF IT'S A BUBBLE, IT'S GOING TO
BURST SOONER OR LATER.

557
00:33:19,935 --> 00:33:23,982
>> LET'S HOPE IT DOESN'T BURST,
WE JUST SPENT A LOT OF MONEY ON
THIS NEW STUDIO.

558
00:33:23,982 --> 00:33:29,035
>> HEY, WHOEVER REPORTED ME TO
HR, SAY IT TO MY FACE NEXT TIME!

559
00:33:31,834 --> 00:33:35,653
>> SORRY.
STILL ADJUSTING TO THE NEW
LAYOUT.

560
00:33:35,653 --> 00:33:38,052
>> ACTUALLY, I THINK IT'S QUITE
AN UPGRADE.

561
00:33:38,052 --> 00:33:42,504
SUCH A FUN LITTLE TREAT FOR THE
VIEWERS TO GET A LITTLE PEEK
BEHIND THE CURTAIN.

562
00:33:43,827 --> 00:33:47,073
>> PROFESSOR, NOW, WHAT DO YOU
MAKE OF THIS?

563
00:33:47,073 --> 00:33:50,438
BECAUSE ON PAPER, INFLATION
RATES ARE PRETTY LOW.

564
00:33:50,438 --> 00:33:54,607
>> WELL, ON THE SCREEN,

565
00:33:54,607 --> 00:33:57,776
INFLATION RATES SEEM PRETTY
HUGE.

566
00:34:03,339 --> 00:34:05,906
>> ALL RIGHT, SOMEONE HACKED MY
COMMUNITY,

567
00:34:05,906 --> 00:34:08,288
PUT MANGA ROCK ON IT
AGAIN.

568
00:34:08,288 --> 00:34:09,986
>> YEAH, SURE, BUDDY.

569
00:34:09,986 --> 00:34:14,705
BUT LOOK, PRICES ARE RISING, BUT
SO ARE THE MARKETS.
WE'RE STILL SOLID.

570
00:34:14,705 --> 00:34:17,146
>> EVERYDAY AMERICANS ARE
CERTAINLY STRUGGLING.

571
00:34:17,146 --> 00:34:20,558
RESULTS FROM A NEW SURVEY SHOWED
52% OF AMERICANS

572
00:34:20,558 --> 00:34:22,870
ARE LIVING
PAYCHECK TO PAYCHECK.

573
00:34:22,870 --> 00:34:26,195
>> OH, SAO PAULO MARKETS,

574
00:34:26,195 --> 00:34:29,335
I DO IT ALL, BABY, PACKING IT --

575
00:34:29,335 --> 00:34:31,817
>> SORRY.
HECTIC NEWS DAY.

576
00:34:31,817 --> 00:34:34,152
AND THIS IS CONCERNING.

577
00:34:34,152 --> 00:34:38,810
1 IN 3 AMERICANS DESCRIBE THEIR
FINANCIAL SITUATION AS IN
CRISIS.

578
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:40,847
IS THIS JUST THE BEGINNING,
PROFESSOR?

579
00:34:40,847 --> 00:34:42,878
>> WELL, I THINK WE'LL SEE --

580
00:34:44,262 --> 00:34:47,834
I THINK WE'LL SEE MORE LAYOFFS AND
PRICE HIKES,

581
00:34:47,834 --> 00:34:50,472
BUT THE CEILING IS
RAISING THE PRICE --

582
00:34:50,472 --> 00:34:55,276
HEY, EXCUSE
ME, DFNY.
JUST TAKE THE PAPER OUT THE
TRAY!

583
00:34:55,276 --> 00:34:59,167
>> PROFESSOR, YOU WERE SAYING?
>> SORRY.

584
00:34:59,167 --> 00:35:02,047
NOW, THE TARIFFS HAVEN'T HELPED
THINGS.

585
00:35:02,047 --> 00:35:06,206
>> ESPECIALLY WITH THE SUPPLY
CHAIN THAT'S STILL RECOVERING
FROM THE COVID ERA.

586
00:35:09,981 --> 00:35:11,626
>> OH, YIKES.

587
00:35:11,626 --> 00:35:13,897
A LITTLE PRINTER ISSUE.
IS EVERYONE OKAY?

588
00:35:13,897 --> 00:35:17,196
>> NO, I JUST GOT ELECTROCUTED,
BITCH!

589
00:35:21,137 --> 00:35:23,399
OKAY, WE'RE GOOD.

590
00:35:25,461 --> 00:35:28,440
>> ALL RIGHTY.
PLEASE CONTINUE, PROFESSOR.

591
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:29,394
>> I'LL GO GET HELP.

592
00:35:29,394 --> 00:35:32,129
>> ACTUALLY, ONE SECOND, I THINK
THIS DUDE IS GOING TO FALL
AGAIN.

593
00:35:32,129 --> 00:35:34,571
YEP, THERE IT IS.

594
00:35:34,571 --> 00:35:36,339
>> WELL, LOOKS LIKE WE'RE AT THE
BREAK.

595
00:35:36,339 --> 00:35:38,654
MORE WITH PROFESSOR HENRY AFTER
THIS.

596
00:35:38,654 --> 00:35:41,721
>> YEAH, YOU GUYS NEED TO PUT UP
A WALL STAT.

597
00:36:07,604 --> 00:36:11,086
BRANDI CARLILE.

598
00:36:11,086 --> 00:36:16,929
Church & State

599
00:36:40,686 --> 00:36:44,583
¶ WHILE THE EMPIRE
WAS FAILING

600
00:36:44,583 --> 00:36:47,604
I WAS SO FAR FROM HOME ¶

601
00:36:47,604 --> 00:36:51,158
¶ I HEARD
A THOUSAND SIRENS WAILING

602
00:36:51,158 --> 00:36:54,211
BUT I WAS NEVER ON MY OWN ¶

603
00:36:54,211 --> 00:36:57,854
¶ WHEN THE BLACKNESS
SLOWLY PARTED

604
00:36:57,854 --> 00:37:00,869
I SAW THE IVORY TOWERS ¶

605
00:37:00,869 --> 00:37:04,446
¶ BEFORE THE REVOLUTION
STARTED

606

BETWEEN THE MADNESS
OF THE HOURS ¶

607
00:37:08,057 --> 00:37:11,081
¶ AND THEY DON'T SEE

608
00:37:11,171 --> 00:37:14,563
WHAT WE SEE

609
00:37:14,563 --> 00:37:17,981
BUT WE BELIEVE

610
00:37:17,981 --> 00:37:21,276
WE BELIEVE ¶

611
00:37:21,276 --> 00:37:24,291
¶ THAT THEY'RE
NOT GONNA LIVE FOREVER

612

BURN TOMORROW
NEVER SAY ¶

613

WE'LL FIND A WAY

616
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:50,938
IMAGINE IF WE COULD ¶

617
00:38:00,850 --> 00:38:04,794
¶ AND IN THE DAYS
THAT QUICKLY FOLLOWED

618
00:38:04,794 --> 00:38:07,811
THEY BEGAN
TO TURN TO STONE ¶

619
00:38:07,811 --> 00:38:11,404
¶ THEY COULDN'T STAND
OR SPEAK OR SWALLOW

620
00:38:11,404 --> 00:38:14,346
THEY COULDN'T
GET OUT OF BED ALONE ¶

621
00:38:14,346 --> 00:38:18,198
¶ WHEN THE FRAILTY
OVERCOMES THEM

622
00:38:18,198 --> 00:38:21,218
AND THEY BEGIN TO CRAWL ¶

623
00:38:21,218 --> 00:38:24,379
¶ REACHING OUT
THEIR BLOODY HANDS

624

GUESS WHO GETS
TO MAKE THE CALL ¶

625
00:38:28,229 --> 00:38:31,310
¶ WELL THEY DON'T SEE

IMAGINE IF WE COULD ¶

635
00:39:20,847 --> 00:39:24,048
I CONTEMPLATE
WITH SOVEREIGN REVERENCE

636
00:39:24,048 --> 00:39:27,402
THAT ACT OF THE WHOLE
AMERICAN PEOPLE WHICH DECLARED

637
00:39:27,402 --> 00:39:30,479
THEIR LEGISLATURES SHOULD MAKE NO LAW

638
00:39:30,479 --> 00:39:32,548
RESPECTING THE
ESTABLISHMENT OF RELIGION

639
00:39:32,548 --> 00:39:35,540
OR
PROHIBITING FREE EXERCISE THEREOF,

640
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:38,646
THUS BUILDING A WALL OF SEPARATION

641
00:39:38,646 --> 00:39:41,849
BETWEEN CHURCH AND
STATE.

642

IMAGINE IF WE COULD ¶

648
00:41:13,184 --> 00:41:18,442
COLIN JOST AND MICHAEL CHE.

649
00:41:24,719 --> 00:41:27,402
>> THANK YOU, THANK YOU.
GOOD EVENING, EVERYONE.

650
00:41:27,402 --> 00:41:31,189
>> WELCOME TO "WEEKEND UPDATE,"
I'M MICHAEL CHE.
>> I'M COLIN JOST.

651
00:41:33,209 --> 00:41:37,201
>>> PRESIDENT TRUMP AND THE
FIRST LADY HOSTED A
TRICK-OR-TREAT EVENT

652
00:41:37,201 --> 00:41:39,274
AT WHAT'S
LEFT OF THE WHITE HOUSE.

653
00:41:39,274 --> 00:41:41,851
AND THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE
THINGS THAT THE PRESIDENT DOES

654
00:41:41,851 --> 00:41:45,154
BECAUSE IT'S SO CLEAR HE NEVER
TRICK-OR-TREATED ONCE IN HIS
LIFE.

655
00:41:45,154 --> 00:41:51,062
IN HIS FIRST TERM, HERE'S HOW HE
GAVE CANDY TO A KID DRESSED AS A
MINION.

656
00:41:57,512 --> 00:42:00,891
MELANIA'S JUST LIKE, I GUESS
THAT IS HOW IT'S DONE.

657
00:42:00,891 --> 00:42:05,910
THEN AGAIN THIS YEAR, HE DID IT
TO A KID DRESSED AS DJ
MARSHMALLOW.

658
00:42:12,311 --> 00:42:14,728
JUST PUT IT IN THE BAG.

659
00:42:14,728 --> 00:42:19,026
WHY IS HE SO WEIRD?
EVEN THE KID IS LIKE, THIS IS
NOT RIGHT.

660
00:42:19,026 --> 00:42:22,227
IT'S KIND OF AN EMBODIMENT OF
HIS SPIRE PRESIDENCY,

661
00:42:22,227 --> 00:42:24,306
BECAUSE
IT'S JUST A VIOLATION OF NORMS

662
00:42:24,306 --> 00:42:28,394
THAT NO OTHER PRESIDENT OR
PERSON HAS EVER CONCEIVED OF.

663
00:42:28,394 --> 00:42:32,743
LIKE, WHO'S EVER THOUGHT, I
SHOULD PUT THE CANDY ON THE
KID'S HEAD.

664
00:42:32,743 --> 00:42:35,410
MY FAVORE PART, THOUGH, IS
WHEN TRUMP AND MELANIA

665
00:42:35,410 --> 00:42:38,488
MADE A
GRAND ENTRANCE TO THIS SONG.

666
00:42:47,872 --> 00:42:50,121
>> MICHAEL JACKSON'S "THRILLER."

667
00:42:50,121 --> 00:42:55,229
JUST THE PERFECT SOUNDTRACK TO
LURE KIDS TO A FAMOUS MANSION.

668
00:42:58,373 --> 00:43:03,166
>>> DUE TO THE GOVERNMENT
SHUTDOWN, S.N.A.P. BENEFITS RAN
OUT OF FUNDS TODAY.

669
00:43:03,166 --> 00:43:08,343
BUT THE GOVERNMENT STILL
PROVIDES FREE FOOD TO FAMILIES
THROUGH THE SECOND AMENDMENT.

670
00:43:11,881 --> 00:43:16,816
JAPAN'S NEW PRIME MINISTER SANAE
TAKAICHI SAID DURING A PRESS CONFERENCE

671
00:43:16,816 --> 00:43:20,531
SHE'S NOMINATING
PRESIDENT TRUMP FOR THE NOBEL
PEACE PRIZE.

672
00:43:20,531 --> 00:43:23,003
AND I CAN'T BELIEVE I GET TO SAY THIS, BUT

673
00:43:23,102 --> 00:43:26,160
THANK GOD NOBODY
LISTENS TO WOMEN.

674
00:43:31,215 --> 00:43:34,914
>>> PRESIDENT TRUMP MET WITH
CHINESE PRESIDENT XI JINPING.

675
00:43:34,914 --> 00:43:37,845
WHEN ASKED HOW THE MEETING WENT,
TRUMP SAID THIS.

676
00:43:37,845 --> 00:43:42,870
>> BUT OVERALL, I GUESS ON THE
SCALE FROM 0 TO 10 WITH 10 BEING
THE PEST?

677
00:43:42,870 --> 00:43:45,724
I WOULD SAY THE MEETING WAS A
12.

678
00:43:46,490 --> 00:43:51,765
>> I GUESS TRUMP JUST WANTED TO
SHOW CHINA WE'RE STILL WAY WORSE
AT MATH.

679
00:43:53,868 --> 00:43:58,410
TRUMP ALSO VISITED SOUTH KOREA
AND WAS GIVEN A GOLD CROWN

680
00:43:58,410 --> 00:44:01,419
AND SERVED BEEF PATTIES WITH KETCHUP
FOR DINNER.

681
00:44:01,419 --> 00:44:06,594
SO THEY BASICALLY GOT THE
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES A
HAPPY MEAL WITH A TOY.

682
00:44:07,817 --> 00:44:10,871
>>> CRITICS OF PRESIDENT TRUMP
ARE CALLING HIM TONE DEAF

683
00:44:10,871 --> 00:44:14,382
FOR
POSTING PICTURES OF HIS NEWLY
RENOVATED WHITE HOUSE BATHROOM

684
00:44:14,382 --> 00:44:16,475
DURING THE GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN.

685
00:44:16,475 --> 00:44:20,042
BUT I'M HAPPY THAT THE FLOOR
LOOKS SLIPPERY.

686
00:44:24,872 --> 00:44:30,798
>>> THE STATE OF TEXAS IS SUING
TYLENOL, CLAIMING THAT IT IS
LINKED TO AUTISM.

687
00:44:30,798 --> 00:44:34,588
OR AS IT'S CALLED IN TEXAS, BOY
AIN'T RIGHT.

688
00:44:37,258 --> 00:44:41,153
>>> KURTIS SLIWA,
REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE FOR MAYOR OF NEW YORK

689
00:44:41,153 --> 00:44:43,445
AND THE WORLD'S ONLY
WHITE PANTHER --

690
00:44:43,445 --> 00:44:48,468
HAS BEEN ENDORSED BY RUDY
GIULIANI.

691
00:44:48,468 --> 00:44:51,946
GIULIANI ONLY LIKES HIM BECAUSE
HIS POLL NUMBERS

692
00:44:51,946 --> 00:44:54,581
ARE BETWEEN 9
AND 11.

693
00:44:54,581 --> 00:44:57,683
9/11!

694
00:44:58,887 --> 00:45:01,849
DID I DO IT RIGHT?
DID I DO IT RIGHT?

695
00:45:02,529 --> 00:45:05,405
>>> THIS WEEKEND IS THE NEW YORK
CITY MARATHON,

696
00:45:05,405 --> 00:45:09,444
WHICH WILL BRING
TO THETY MORE THAN 50,000
RUNNERS FROM OVER 100 COUNTRIES.

697
00:45:09,444 --> 00:45:12,608
HERE TO COMMENT IS THE WORLD'S
NUMBER ONE MARATHONER -- OH --

698
00:45:12,608 --> 00:45:15,321
GEORGE SANTOS.

699
00:45:19,349 --> 00:45:20,604
YES, COLIN.

700
00:45:20,604 --> 00:45:24,433
CAN YOU BELIEVE I JUST FINISHED
THE MARATHON?

701
00:45:24,433 --> 00:45:26,166
>> THE MARATHON IS TOMORROW.

702
00:45:26,166 --> 00:45:29,736
>> YEAH, WELL IT'S A RECORD, I
ALREADY WON!

703
00:45:29,998 --> 00:45:33,730
>> YOU KNOW -- YOU DIDN'T WIN
THE MARATHON.

704
00:45:33,730 --> 00:45:36,035
I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN DOING A MEDIA
COMEBACK TOUR

705
00:45:36,035 --> 00:45:38,000
SINCE TRUMP
COMMUTED YOUR PRISON SENTENCE.

706
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,623
>> WELL, YEAH, PRISON WAS CRAZY.

707
00:45:40,623 --> 00:45:43,983
I WAS IN A ROOM BY MYSELF
TALKING TO PEOPLE THROUGH A WALL,

708
00:45:43,983 --> 00:45:47,977
GOING ON EIGHT DATES A
DAY, TRYING TO FIND THE LOVE OF
MY LIFE.

709
00:45:47,977 --> 00:45:52,745
>> YOU WERE NOT ON "LOVE IS
BLIND," GEORGE, YOU WERE IN
JAIL.

710
00:45:52,745 --> 00:45:55,873
>> FINE, BUT YOU KNOW WHAT,
PRISON CHANGED ME, COLIN.

711
00:45:55,873 --> 00:45:57,468
I LOST A TON OF WEIGHT.

712
00:45:57,468 --> 00:46:00,981
>> REALLY, HOW MUCH DID YOU
LOSE?
>> I GAINED 50 POUNDS.

713
00:46:00,981 --> 00:46:05,068
VERY "SUMMER I TURNED PRETTY."
NOW I ONLY TELL THE TRUTH.

714
00:46:05,068 --> 00:46:07,342
>> SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE STILL A
LIAR, GEORGE.

715
00:46:07,342 --> 00:46:09,946
>> YOU ARE.
>> I AM NOT.

716
00:46:09,946 --> 00:46:12,839
>> THEN HOW COME YOUR PANTS ARE
ON FIRE?

717
00:46:12,839 --> 00:46:16,068
>> STOP TOUCHING ME UNDERNEATH
THE DESK, GEORGE.

718
00:46:16,068 --> 00:46:19,894
>> YOU WISH, COLIN.
I WAS JUST ROBBING YOU.
>> HEY!

719
00:46:19,894 --> 00:46:24,534
>> WHOA.
PHOTOS OF EVERY FEMALE CAST
MEMBER?

720
00:46:24,986 --> 00:46:28,336
GIVE ME BACK MY ANGELS.

721
00:46:31,058 --> 00:46:34,524
WELL, ANYWAY, COLIN, I'M GOING
ON ALL THESE SHOWS

722
00:46:34,524 --> 00:46:37,310
TO TELL THE
TRUTH ABOUT WHAT IT'S LIKE IN
PRISON.

723
00:46:37,310 --> 00:46:39,699
>> WELL, WASN'T YOUR PRISON ONLY
LIKE MINIMUM SECURITY?

724
00:46:39,699 --> 00:46:43,084
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
I WAS IN JAIL WITH OTHER
WHITE-COLLAR CRIMINALS,

725
00:46:43,084 --> 00:46:45,458
EVEN
THOUGH I'M BLACK.

726
00:46:45,458 --> 00:46:47,488
>> YOU ARE NOT BLACK.

727
00:46:47,488 --> 00:46:50,685
>> NO, WOW, ARE YOU ACCUSING ME
OF LYING ABOUT MY RACE?

728
00:46:50,685 --> 00:46:52,323
LIKE RACHEL DOLEZAL?

729
00:46:52,323 --> 00:46:55,312
THAT HORRIBLE WOMAN WHO LIED
ABOUT BEING BLACK?

730
00:46:55,312 --> 00:46:57,632
REMEMBER HER?
THAT WAS ME.

731
00:46:57,632 --> 00:47:00,169
>> GEORGE.
GEORGE, COME ON.

732
00:47:00,169 --> 00:47:02,260
>> HOLD ON, I HAVE TO TAKE THIS,
IT'S ONE OF MY FRIENDS FROM
PRISON.

733
00:47:02,260 --> 00:47:03,473
>> OKAY, ALL RIGHT.

734
00:47:03,473 --> 00:47:06,088
>> HELLO?
HI, DEWAYNE.
