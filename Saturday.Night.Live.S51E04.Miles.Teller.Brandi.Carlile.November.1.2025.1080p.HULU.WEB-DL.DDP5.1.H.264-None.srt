1
00:00:00,162 --> 00:00:04,298
>>> YOU'RE WATCHING NEW YORK 1,
NEW YORK'S NUMBER FIVE NEWS
STATION.

2
00:00:09,481 --> 00:00:11,712
>> HELLO.

3
00:00:12,611 --> 00:00:15,282
HELLO AND GOOD EVENING FROM NEW
YORK 1.

4
00:00:15,282 --> 00:00:16,454
YAMMER ROLL LOUIS,

5
00:00:16,454 --> 00:00:21,146
AND I AM NOW OFFICIALLY THE LEAST FAMOUS
PERSON TO BE IMPERSONATED ON
SNL.

6
00:00:21,146 --> 00:00:24,563
BUT TRUST ME, IT'S UNCANNY.

7
00:00:24,563 --> 00:00:28,163
WE'RE COMING TO YOU LIVE FOR
THIS THE THIRD, FINAL,

8
00:00:28,163 --> 00:00:31,378
AND
FICTIONAL NEW YORK CITY MAYORAL
DEBATE.

9
00:00:31,378 --> 00:00:35,493
TONIGHT'S EVENT IS SPONSORED BY
GRISTINI'S SUPERMARKET.

10
00:00:35,493 --> 00:00:38,544
SAY, WHERE DID YOU GET THAT WET
SANDWICH?

11
00:00:38,544 --> 00:00:40,715
WHY, GRISTITI'S, OF COURSE.

12
00:00:40,715 --> 00:00:42,709
AND BIKE LANES.

13
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:44,935
YOU WANT A NEW WAY TO DIE?

14
00:00:45,247 --> 00:00:47,912
STEP INTO A BIKE LANE.

15
00:00:47,912 --> 00:00:50,885
TONIGHT, WE'RE GOING TO HEAR
FROM TWO VIABLE CANDIDATES

16
00:00:50,885 --> 00:00:53,582
AND
ONE GOOD OLD-FASHIONED NEW YORK
NUT.

17
00:00:53,582 --> 00:00:58,210
FIRST UP, FORMER NEW YORK
GOVERNOR ANDREW CUOMO.

18
00:01:00,526 --> 00:01:03,652
>> HELLO, VOTERS.
YOU ALL KNOW ME.

19
00:01:03,652 --> 00:01:05,402
I GOT US THROUGH COVID, AND THEN

20
00:01:05,402 --> 00:01:09,040
YADA YADA YADA, HONK HONK,
SQUEEZE SQUEEZE.

21
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,777
ANYWAY, I'M BACK.

22
00:01:10,777 --> 00:01:14,246
I'M A BORN AND BRED NEW YORKER.
I LOVE IT HERE.

23
00:01:14,246 --> 00:01:17,364
I KNOW THIS CITY LIKE THE BACK
OF A WOMAN'S BACK,

24
00:01:17,364 --> 00:01:19,543
MAMMA MIA!

25
00:01:20,238 --> 00:01:25,281
>> NEXT WE HAVE THE DEMOCRATIC
NOMINEE, ZOHRAN MAMDANI.

26
00:01:27,121 --> 00:01:30,169
>> HELLO, EVERYONE.
I'M HAPPY TO BE HERE.

27
00:01:30,169 --> 00:01:34,619
AND I'M READY TO SPEND THE NEXT
HOUR HEARING MY OPPONENTS
PRONOUNCE MY NAME

28
00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:37,818
IN WAYS YOU
COULDN'T BEGIN TO IMAGINE.

29
00:01:37,818 --> 00:01:40,647
AND I KNOW SOME OF YOU ARE OUT
THERE SCARED

30
00:01:40,647 --> 00:01:43,417
OF THE IDEA OF A
YOUNG SOCIAL LIST MUSLIM MAYOR,

31
00:01:43,417 --> 00:01:45,027
SO ALLOW ME TO PUT YOU AT EASE --

32
00:01:45,027 --> 00:01:47,626
BY SMILING AFTER EVERY ANSWER

33
00:01:47,626 --> 00:01:51,253
IN A WAY THAT PHYSICALLY
HURTS MY FACE.

34
00:01:54,873 --> 00:01:56,514
>> ALL RIGHT.

35
00:01:56,514 --> 00:01:59,674
AND NOW LET'S DO A FUN ONE.

36
00:02:00,059 --> 00:02:04,125
THE REPUBLICAN NOMINEE, CURTIS
SLIWA.

37
00:02:04,682 --> 00:02:08,896
YES.
MR. SLIWA, YOUR OPENING
STATEMENT?

38
00:02:08,896 --> 00:02:12,696
>> I'M THRILLED TO BE HERE AND
NOT GETTING SHOT IN THE BACK

39
00:02:12,696 --> 00:02:16,391
OF A YELLOW CAB FIVE TIMES
BY THE GOTTIS AND GAMBINOS,

40
00:02:16,391 --> 00:02:22,642
AS I WAS
FAMOUSLY IN 1992, 1993, AND '94.

41
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:25,216
BUT I'M THE RIGHT CHOICE TO BE
YOUR NEXT MAYOR.

42
00:02:25,216 --> 00:02:27,555
NO OFFENSE TO MR. OPPONENTS, MR. CUOMO,

43
00:02:27,555 --> 00:02:31,618
AND I BELIEVE I'M SAYING
THIS RIGHT, ZOLTAR RAMZOMBIE.

44
00:02:34,022 --> 00:02:36,525
>> THAT'S NOT EVEN CLOSE.

45
00:02:36,525 --> 00:02:39,960
>> ALL RIGHT, CANDIDATES, YOU'RE
ALL RUNNING TO BE MAYOR OF NEW
YORK CITY.

46
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:44,906
SO MY QUESTION IS, WHY WOULD YOU
WANT THE WORST JOB IN THE
WORLD?

47
00:02:44,906 --> 00:02:48,355
>> AS WE ALL KNOW, AS SOON AS
YOU ELECTED MAYOR,

48
00:02:48,355 --> 00:02:50,385
EVERYONE IN
THE CITY IMMEDIATELY HATES YOU.

49
00:02:50,385 --> 00:02:54,458
AND IN THAT WAY, I AM ALREADY
ONE STEP AHEAD OF THE GAME.

50
00:02:55,136 --> 00:02:57,310
>> MR. MAMDANI, SAME QUESTION.

51
00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:00,790
>> I WANT TO BE MAYOR SO I CAN
DELIVER A BETTER NEW YORK,

52
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:04,940
FREE
HEALTH CARE, AFFORDABLE HOUSING,
FREE WI-FI.

53
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:07,390
AS MAYOR, CAN I MAKE THAT
HAPPEN?

54
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:09,558
I'M NOT SURE YET.

55
00:03:09,558 --> 00:03:12,477
BUT TOGETHER, WE'RE GOING TO
FIND OUT.

56
00:03:12,477 --> 00:03:15,778
THAT THE ANSWER IS NO.

57
00:03:16,968 --> 00:03:19,088
>> I GOT TO SAY SOMETHING.

58
00:03:19,088 --> 00:03:21,787
MY OPPONENT, NORMAN VANDANIEL,

59
00:03:21,787 --> 00:03:24,856
IS INEXPERIENCED AND FRANKLY A NEPO BABY,

60
00:03:24,856 --> 00:03:28,396
WHERE MY DAD WAS JUST
GOVERNOR OF NEW YORK.

61
00:03:28,396 --> 00:03:32,331
>> OF COURSE, AS YOU KNOW, MY
DAD WAS BRUTALLY KIDNAPPED

62
00:03:32,331 --> 00:03:36,489
AND
TIED TO THE TRACKS OF THE
CYCLONE AT CONEY ISLAND.

63
00:03:37,106 --> 00:03:39,422
I'M SORRY, WHAT WAS YOUR
QUESTION?

64
00:03:39,422 --> 00:03:44,390
>> WHY DO YOU WANT TO BE MAYOR?
>> OH, I NEED A JOB.

65
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:47,484
>> ALL RIGHT, LET'S MOVE ON TO
MOST IMPORTANT QUESTION TONIGHT.

66
00:03:47,484 --> 00:03:50,781
WHAT'S YOUR GO-TO BAGEL ORDER?
MR. MAMDANI?

67
00:03:50,781 --> 00:03:54,948
>> WHAT I'D LIKE IS FOR THE
PERSON SERVING ME THAT BAGEL

68
00:03:54,948 --> 00:03:57,950
TO
BE PAID A LIVING WAGE.

69
00:04:00,123 --> 00:04:04,393
>> BOO!
RELAX, NERD.

70
00:04:04,393 --> 00:04:07,211
MR. CUOMO, GO-TO BAGEL ORDER?

71
00:04:07,211 --> 00:04:11,256
>> I SWEAR TO GOD I AM NOT
SAYING THIS TO PANDER TO JEWISH
VOTERS.

72
00:04:11,256 --> 00:04:15,843
BUT IT'S A GEFILTE FISH EATEN IN
A BOOTH WITH BARBRA STREISAND

73
00:04:15,843 --> 00:04:17,907
BY THE LIGHT OF A MENORAH.

74
00:04:19,442 --> 00:04:22,619
>> ONCE AGAIN, BOO.

75
00:04:22,619 --> 00:04:25,818
MR. SLIWA, GO-TO BAGEL ORDER.

76
00:04:25,818 --> 00:04:29,752
>> AS YOU KNOW, IN 1982, I HAD
MY PENIS CUT OFF

77
00:04:29,752 --> 00:04:32,726
AND FED TO ME
BY THE YAKUZA.

78
00:04:32,726 --> 00:04:37,099
OBVIOUSLY BLUEBERRY BAGEL, STRAWBERRY
CREAM CHEESE

79
00:04:37,099 --> 00:04:39,167
EATEN OVER A GAR
BACK CAN.

80
00:04:39,167 --> 00:04:41,079
>> THANK YOU, CANDIDATES.

81
00:04:41,079 --> 00:04:44,696
TAKE A MOMENT
LET'S THANK A FEW MORE OF
TONIGHT'S SPONSORS,

82
00:04:44,696 --> 00:04:46,143
PEDICABS.

83
00:04:46,143 --> 00:04:50,061
SLOWER THAN WALKING, LOUDER THAN
HELL.

84
00:04:50,061 --> 00:04:51,982
AND HUDSON YARDS.

85
00:04:51,982 --> 00:04:54,644
SHOP, DINE, OR TAKE THE EASY WAY OUT

86
00:04:54,644 --> 00:04:56,755
AT HUDSON YARDS.

87
00:05:00,542 --> 00:05:04,471
MOVING ON.
MOVING ON TO OUR NEXT TOPIC,

88
00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:07,079
WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO SAY TO
UNDECIDED VOTERS?

89
00:05:07,079 --> 00:05:08,974
GOVERNOR CUOMO, LET'S START WITH
YOU.

90
00:05:08,974 --> 00:05:12,472
>> LISTEN, I HAVE ACTUAL
GOVERNING EXPERIENCE.

91
00:05:12,472 --> 00:05:14,905
I HAVE THE RELATIONSHIPS TO GET
THE JOB DONE

92
00:05:14,905 --> 00:05:18,275
AND THE SUPPORT OF
SOME OF THE FINEST PEOPLE IN THE
CITY.

93
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:22,231
>> LIKE ME, MAYOR ERIC ADAMS.

94
00:05:22,231 --> 00:05:25,005
THIS IS MY GUY RIGHT HERE, MAN.
LISTEN UP.

95
00:05:25,005 --> 00:05:27,242
IF YOU LIKE ME, YOU GONNA LOVE
THIS GUY!

96
00:05:27,242 --> 00:05:29,542
HE LIKE ME PART TWO!

97
00:05:29,542 --> 00:05:32,208
>> WELL, NO, ERIC.
REMEMBER THE PLAN.

98
00:05:32,208 --> 00:05:34,463
>> OH, OH, YEAH I GOT YOU.
I GOT YOU.

99
00:05:34,463 --> 00:05:36,864
I, ERIC ADAMS, ENDORSE HIM,

100
00:05:36,928 --> 00:05:39,194
ZORDAN MAMAGRAMMA.

101
00:05:39,956 --> 00:05:42,377
>> NO, NO, NO THANK YOU.

102
00:05:42,377 --> 00:05:46,424
>> MR. MAMDANI, YOUR MESSAGE TO
UNDECIDED VOTERS?

103
00:05:46,424 --> 00:05:49,353
>> MY MESSAGE IS THIS.

104
00:05:51,473 --> 00:05:55,386
HEY, GIRL.
I KNOW YOU GOT A LITTLE WHITE
GUILT

105
00:05:55,386 --> 00:05:58,552
FOR GENTRIFYING THAT
SPANISH NEIGHBORHOOD, DON'T YOU?

106
00:05:58,552 --> 00:06:00,509
WHY DON'T YOU VOTE FOR ME?

107
00:06:00,509 --> 00:06:03,548
YOU KNOW YOU'LL FEEL A LITTLE
LESS BAD ABOUT THAT CHICKEN AND
RICE SHOP

108
00:06:03,548 --> 00:06:05,902
GETTING TURNED INTO A
SWEETGREENS.

109
00:06:05,902 --> 00:06:08,973
WHY DON'T YOU HIT ME UP AT THE
BALLOT BOX, GIRL?

110
00:06:12,122 --> 00:06:14,494
>> MR. MAMDANI,

111
00:06:14,494 --> 00:06:18,033
YOU WERE WARNED
THAT THIS IS THE FORUM FOR YOUR
TIKTOKRY.

112
00:06:18,033 --> 00:06:22,686
MR. SLIWA, WHY SHOULD NEW
YORKERS VOTE FOR YOU?

113
00:06:22,686 --> 00:06:25,356
>> IT'S SIMPLE.
I'M THE ONLY CANDIDATE HERE

114
00:06:25,356 --> 00:06:28,830
WHO'S BEEN DANGLED WE MY
TESTICLES OVER THE VERAZZANO BRIDGE

115
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:32,649
BY A LITTLE-KNOWN GANG
CALLED THE LORDS OF FLATBUSH.

116
00:06:32,649 --> 00:06:37,751
I WAS ALSO POURED INTO THE
FOUNDATION OF GIANTS STADIUM AND
CRAWLED MY WAY OUT.

117
00:06:37,751 --> 00:06:40,639
JUST ON MY WAY HERE, I WAS
EJACULATED UPON

118
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:45,353
DINER
SPIDER

119
00:06:46,508 --> 00:06:50,515
JUST ON YOUR WAY HERE?

120
00:06:50,515 --> 00:06:52,226
ALL RIGHT, LET'S MOVE ON.

121
00:06:52,226 --> 00:06:56,104
FROM CONGESTION PRICING TO
HOMELESSNESS TO I.C.E. RAIDS,

122
00:06:56,104 --> 00:06:58,432
THERE ARE MANY ISSUES FACING OUR
CITY.

123
00:06:58,432 --> 00:07:02,289
WHAT DO YOU THINK IS THE BIGGEST
PROBLEM YOU HAVE TO CONFRONT AS
MAYOR?

124
00:07:02,289 --> 00:07:04,664
>> IT'S ME!

125
00:07:04,664 --> 00:07:09,138
YES.
THEY CAN PRETEND THIS ELECTION
IS ABOUT HOUSING AND TAXES,

126
00:07:09,138 --> 00:07:11,089
BUT
WE ALL KNOW IT'S ABOUT ME,
RIGHT?

127
00:07:11,089 --> 00:07:14,350
BECAUSE I'M GOING TO BE VERY
INVOLVED, VERY HANDS-ON.

128
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:17,465
THIS GUY KNOWS ABOUT HANDS ON,
RIGHT, CUOMO?

129
00:07:17,465 --> 00:07:19,310
>> HEY-YO, YOU GOT ME.

130
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:22,612
>> LOOK AT THESE CANDIDATES WE
GOT.
LOOK AT CURTIS SLIWA.

131
00:07:22,612 --> 00:07:24,515
I LOVE HIM, BUT WE'VE GOT TO DO
SOMETHING

132
00:07:24,515 --> 00:07:27,312
ABOUT THAT "EMILY IN
PARIS" LOOKING HAT, RIGHT?

133
00:07:27,312 --> 00:07:29,672
HE'S MY "RUSHMORE" MAX!

134
00:07:29,672 --> 00:07:35,171
AND THE FRONT-RUNNER ZORA
MAMDANI.

135
00:07:35,172 --> 00:07:39,942
MCKENZEY

136
00:07:39,942 --> 00:07:42,596
HE'S TOO YOUNG TO LEAD, FOLKS,
HE'S TOO YOUNG.

137
00:07:42,596 --> 00:07:44,699
HE DOESN'T HAVE THE WOBBLY WALK.

138
00:07:44,805 --> 00:07:48,396
OR FRANKLY THE MIND I HAVE.
GOOD BRAIN.

139
00:07:48,396 --> 00:07:53,059
I TOOK A COGNITIVE TEST.
I DID SO WELL ON MY COGNITIVE TEST

140
00:07:53,059 --> 00:07:56,321
THAT THEY IMMEDIATELY GAVE
ME AN MRI.

141
00:07:56,321 --> 00:07:59,545
THEY SAID THEY'D NEVER SEEN
ANYTHING LIKE IT.

142
00:07:59,545 --> 00:08:04,113
BUT IN TERMS OF ELECTION, I'D
LIKE TO GO BACK TO THAT VERY
IMPORTANT QUESTION.

143
00:08:04,113 --> 00:08:09,068
THE BAGEL.
MY GO-TO BAGEL ORDER IS BIG MAC
WITH A HOLE IN THE MIDDLE.

144
00:08:09,068 --> 00:08:13,559
AND I MAY NOT LIVE IN NEW YORK
ANYMORE, AWW!

145
00:08:14,646 --> 00:08:18,822
BUT I'M ALWAYS WATCHING.
LURKING IN THE SHADOWS.

146
00:08:18,822 --> 00:08:22,634
MUCH LIKE THE LATE, GREAT
PHANTOM OF THE OPERA.

147
00:08:22,634 --> 00:08:24,927
TERRIBLE, WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM
IN TERMS OF OPERA

148
00:08:24,927 --> 00:08:28,848
AND WITH
REGARD TO BEING BURNED BY
CHANDELIER.

149
00:08:28,848 --> 00:08:34,239
PERHAPS I'LL ADD "NEW YORK
MAYOR" TO MY LIST OF DUTIES.

150
00:08:34,239 --> 00:08:35,399
COME ON.

151
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:37,674
¶ OPEN UP YOUR MIND

152
00:08:37,674 --> 00:08:41,058
LET YOUR FANTASIES UNWIND ¶

153
00:08:41,058 --> 00:08:44,128
¶ IN THIS DARKNESS WHICH YOU KNOW

154
00:08:44,128 --> 00:08:47,728
YOU CANNOT FIND ¶

155
00:08:47,728 --> 00:08:49,862
¶ THE DARKNESS OF

156
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:55,633
THE MUSIC OF THE NIGHT ¶

157
00:08:55,633 --> 00:09:00,410
AND LIVE FROM NEW YORK, IT'S
SATURDAY NIGHT!

158
00:11:02,785 --> 00:11:08,206
MUSICAL

159
00:11:08,206 --> 00:11:12,506
HOST

160
00:11:14,905 --> 00:11:20,482
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN -- MILES
TELLER!

161
00:11:37,707 --> 00:11:40,583
>> THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK
YOU VERY MUCH.

162
00:11:40,583 --> 00:11:44,019
I AM SO HAPPY TO BE BACK HOSTING
SNL.

163
00:11:44,019 --> 00:11:45,420
THE LAST TIME --

164
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:48,163
THANK YOU.

165
00:11:48,163 --> 00:11:50,841
THE LAST TIME I HOSTED WAS IN
2022.

166
00:11:50,841 --> 00:11:54,721
IT MEANS A LOT TO BE HERE FOR
ME, ESPECIALLY ON HALLOWEEN
WEEKEND.

167
00:11:54,721 --> 00:11:58,932
YEAH, BECAUSE WHEN I WAS A KID,
ME AND MY SISTERS

168
00:11:58,932 --> 00:12:01,940
USED TO GO
TRICK-OR-TREATING AS "SNL"
CHARACTERS.

169
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:04,657
SO I DON'T KNOW IF YOU REMEMBER
THE NIGHT OF THE ROCKSBURY GUYS.

170
00:12:04,657 --> 00:12:07,833
THEY'RE THE BEST.
WILL FERRELL, CHRIS McCANN.

171
00:12:10,618 --> 00:12:14,424
WHERE ARE THEY?
THERE THEY ARE.

172
00:12:15,204 --> 00:12:17,718
WE WENT AS THEM ONE YEAR,

173
00:12:17,718 --> 00:12:21,306
AND HERE'S A PHOTO OF ME AND MY
SISTERS.

174
00:12:26,307 --> 00:12:31,547
I MEAN, HONESTLY, I'M JUST NOW
REALIZING HOW FAR OFF WE WERE
WITH THAT LOOK.

175
00:12:31,547 --> 00:12:34,689
IT'S LIKE WE JUST LOOK LIKE
LITTLE GREEK MEN.

176
00:12:34,689 --> 00:12:37,090
IT MUST HAVE BEEN SO CONFUSING,

177
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:39,961
ME AND MY SISTERS GOING UP TO
DOORS JUST LIKE --

178
00:12:46,881 --> 00:12:50,140
BUT GROWING UP, I MOVED AROUND A
LOT.

179
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:54,797
SO "SNL" HAS ALWAYS BEEN ONE OF
THE MORE CONSISTENT PARTS OF MY
LIFE.

180
00:12:54,797 --> 00:12:59,492
I LIVED IN PENNSYLVANIA,
GEORGIA, DELAWARE, JERSEY, AND
FLORIDA.

181
00:12:59,492 --> 00:13:01,016
ALL BEFORE I WAS 12.

182
00:13:01,016 --> 00:13:04,309
SO HONESTLY, IT GETS A BIT
CONFUSING

183
00:13:04,309 --> 00:13:06,783
WHEN PEOPLE ASK ME
WHERE I'M FROM.

184
00:13:06,783 --> 00:13:09,829
I'M LIKE, I DON'T KNOW, MAN,
TOP GUN 2?

185
00:13:09,829 --> 00:13:12,353
WHERE ARE YOU FROM?

186
00:13:12,353 --> 00:13:14,717
BUT THAT'S WHY I LOVE COMING
HERE.

187
00:13:14,717 --> 00:13:16,763
BECAUSE I HAVE A LOT OF
MEMORIES.

188
00:13:16,763 --> 00:13:20,410
LIKE RIGHT THERE.
THAT'S WHERE I HAD MY FIRST
BEER.

189
00:13:20,476 --> 00:13:24,080
NOT EVER.
JUST LIKE TODAY.

190
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:27,740
AND OVER THERE.
OH, THAT'S WHERE I ALMOST FELL
GETTING OUT OF MY COSTUME.

191
00:13:27,855 --> 00:13:30,421
AND RIGHT THERE, THAT'S WHERE BOWEN SAID,

192
00:13:30,421 --> 00:13:33,835
"MILES, YOU PROBABLY
FELL BECAUSE YOU HAD SO MANY
BEERS."

193
00:13:33,835 --> 00:13:35,538
I JUST LOVE MEMORIES.

194
00:13:35,538 --> 00:13:37,769
REALLY NICE JUST TO REFLECT.

195
00:13:37,769 --> 00:13:41,683
BUT HONESTLY, GUYS, I'M SO HAPPY
TO BE HERE WITH ALL OF YOU.

196
00:13:41,683 --> 00:13:44,494
A LOT HAS HAPPENED SINCE THE
LAST TIME THAT I HOSTED.

197
00:13:44,494 --> 00:13:48,197
A FEW MONTHS AGO, MY WIFE AND I
LOST OUR HOUSE IN THE PALISADES
FIRE.

198
00:13:48,197 --> 00:13:50,500
BUT DON'T WORRY.
SERIOUSLY, DO NOT WORRY.

199
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:53,095
WE'RE DOING GREAT.
I SEE YOU UP THERE, BABY.

200
00:13:53,095 --> 00:13:56,354
BUT THAT EXPERIENCE HAS MADE ME
INCREDIBLY GRATEFUL

201
00:13:56,354 --> 00:13:59,235
TO HAVE SO
MANY PLACES THAT I CAN CALL
HOME.

202
00:13:59,235 --> 00:14:03,213
BUT BASED ON WHAT HAPPENED TO
THE LAST PLACE THAT I CALLED HOME,

203
00:14:03,213 --> 00:14:05,033
I JUST WANT TO SAY --

204
00:14:05,033 --> 00:14:08,254
THERE'S FIRE EXITS LOCATED
THERE, THERE, THERE.

205
00:14:08,254 --> 00:14:09,616
WE GOT TWO IN THE BACK.

206
00:14:09,616 --> 00:14:11,798
THANK YOU, GUYS.
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A GREAT
SHOW.

207
00:14:11,798 --> 00:14:13,417
BRANDI

208
00:14:13,417 --> 00:14:16,309
STICK

209
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:38,449
>>> IT'S "WHAT DID I DO LAST
NIGHT?"

210
00:14:38,449 --> 00:14:41,098
AND HERE'S YOUR HOST.

211
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:47,159
>> HELLO.
HELLO, HELLO, HELLO.

212
00:14:47,159 --> 00:14:49,178
I AM YOUR HOST, GAY FOPAY.

213
00:14:49,178 --> 00:14:54,627
AND WELCOME BACK TO "WHAT DID I
DO LAST NIGHT?"

214
00:14:54,627 --> 00:14:57,799
THE ONLY GAME SHOW WHERE THREE
DEEPLY HUNGOVER CONTESTANTS

215
00:14:57,799 --> 00:15:01,101
HAVE
TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THEY GOT UP
TO THE NIGHT BEFORE.

216
00:15:01,101 --> 00:15:05,716
AND OF COURSE, TODAY IS OUR
EXTRA-PAINFUL DAY AFTER
HALLOWEEN EDITION.

217
00:15:05,716 --> 00:15:07,845
LET'S MEET OUR PLAYERS.

218
00:15:08,668 --> 00:15:12,004
>> OH, GOD, TURN IT DOWN.

219
00:15:12,004 --> 00:15:15,370
>> FIRST UP WE'VE GOT KENNETH
FROM NEW JERSEY.

220
00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:18,659
HELLO, KENNETH.
OH, MAN, STINKS OVER HERE.

221
00:15:18,659 --> 00:15:22,346
>> YEAH, I CLAWED THE CASTLE
LAST NIGHT.
>> WHAT'S THAT?

222
00:15:22,346 --> 00:15:26,177
>> WHEN YOU DRANK 14 WHITE CLAWS
AND EAT WHITE CASTLE.

223
00:15:26,177 --> 00:15:28,648
>> YOU GOT A DEATH WISH,
BROTHER.

224
00:15:28,648 --> 00:15:32,148
NEXT WE HAVE ELIZABETH FROM NEW
MEXICO.

225
00:15:32,148 --> 00:15:35,020
WHAT WAS YOUR COSTUME?
>> SEXY CAT.

226
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:37,861
>> I'M SURE IT STARTED THAT WAY.

227
00:15:37,861 --> 00:15:41,638
IF YOU WERE AT THE SHELTER,
YOU'D BE PUT DOWN, GIRL.

228
00:15:41,638 --> 00:15:45,911
AND YOUR NAME IS RONDELL FROM
WHERE?

229
00:15:45,911 --> 00:15:48,857
>> RON FROM DELAWARE.

230
00:15:48,857 --> 00:15:52,575
I WAS SHAKING WHEN I WROTE THAT.
>> YEAH, OKAY.

231
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:54,752
LOUIS, TELL THEM WHAT THEY'RE
PLAYING FOR.

232
00:15:54,752 --> 00:15:56,696
>> TODAY'S GRAND PRIZE IS

233
00:15:56,696 --> 00:15:59,603
A LARGE PEDIALYTE AND A BACON, EGG
AND CHEESE.

234
00:15:59,603 --> 00:16:02,638
>> MY GOD.
>> I NEED THAT.

235
00:16:02,638 --> 00:16:05,361
>> I NEED THAT NOW.
I NEED THAT.

236
00:16:05,361 --> 00:16:07,625
>> WELL, YOU CAN HAVE IT IF YOU
WIN.

237
00:16:07,625 --> 00:16:11,855
KENNETH, YOU'RE UP FIRST.
WHAT WAS YOUR UBER FAUX PAS?

238
00:16:11,855 --> 00:16:15,201
WAS IT "A," A LITTLE PUKE?

239
00:16:15,201 --> 00:16:20,116
B, MAJOR MADE YOUR DRIVER GO
THROUGH THE DRIVE-THRU AND PAY
FOR YOUR FOOD?

240
00:16:20,116 --> 00:16:25,037
OR "C," ASKED FOR THE AUX THEN
WATCHED PORN?

241
00:16:26,722 --> 00:16:30,768
>> KNOWING MYSELF, I'D SAY I
PUKED IN THE UBER.

242
00:16:30,768 --> 00:16:34,511
>> OH, SO CLOSE.
THAT WAS ACTUALLY A TRICK
QUESTION.

243
00:16:34,511 --> 00:16:37,268
YOU DID PUKE, BUT IT WASN'T IN
AN UBER.

244
00:16:37,268 --> 00:16:41,164
YOU JUST SAW A GUY IN A CAMRY,
AND YOU GOT IN.

245
00:16:41,164 --> 00:16:44,619
>> IN MY DEFENSE, I DO THAT A
LOT.

246
00:16:44,619 --> 00:16:47,369
>> DOESN'T MATTER.
YOUR PENALTY IS --

247
00:16:47,369 --> 00:16:50,390
LISTENING TO
MY NEPHEW, ANDRE, LEARN THE SAX.

248
00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:51,808
>> NO.

249
00:16:53,083 --> 00:16:57,169
>> STOP!
>> NO, NO!

250
00:16:59,202 --> 00:17:02,610
>> ALL RIGHT.
NEXT UP, ELIZABETH.

251
00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:06,695
YOUR QUESTION IS, WHO DID YOU
BITE, AND WHERE DID YOU BITE
THEM?

252
00:17:06,695 --> 00:17:09,795
>> I BIT SOMEONE?
>> YOU MOST CERTAINLY DID.

253
00:17:09,795 --> 00:17:13,985
AND YOUR CHOICES ARE, "A," YOUR
FRIEND JENNA IN THE NECK.

254
00:17:13,985 --> 00:17:17,038
B, YOURSELF ON THE TONGUE.

255
00:17:17,038 --> 00:17:20,906
OR "C," THE BOUNCER ON THE
NIPPLE.

256
00:17:20,906 --> 00:17:25,835
>> OH, OH -- MY TONGUE HURTS
TODAY, SO I'M THINKING "B,"
MYSELF.

257
00:17:25,835 --> 00:17:29,727
>> NO.
THE ANSWER WAS, ALL OF THE
ABOVE.

258
00:17:29,727 --> 00:17:34,953
AND YOUR PERSONALITY IS,
CATCHING UP WITH AN ACQUAINTANCE
FROM HIGH SCHOOL.

259
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:40,658
>> HEY, I'M SURE YOU HEARD, BUT
THINGS HAVEN'T BEEN GOING GREAT
FOR ME.

260
00:17:40,658 --> 00:17:43,326
THANKS FOR AGREEING TO HELP ME
MOVE.

261
00:17:43,326 --> 00:17:46,054
>> NOOOOO!

262
00:17:46,054 --> 00:17:49,417
>> ALL RIGHT, NOW RON, YOUR
QUESTION INCLUDES A VIDEO CLUE.

263
00:17:49,417 --> 00:17:52,527
THIS IS SECURITY FOOTAGE OF YOU
AT THE ATM LAST NIGHT.

264
00:17:52,527 --> 00:17:53,698
>> OH GOD.

265
00:17:53,698 --> 00:17:55,790
>> LOUIS, LET'S ROLL THE TAPE.

266
00:17:55,790 --> 00:17:59,418
>> THE MONEY MACHINE, THE MONEY
MACHINE.

267
00:17:59,418 --> 00:18:02,406
CAN'T YOU GET MONEY FOR FREE?

268
00:18:02,406 --> 00:18:04,647
DRY HEAVING

269
00:18:05,047 --> 00:18:07,136
BATHROOM

270
00:18:07,136 --> 00:18:08,972
OH, LOOK AT HIM GO!

271
00:18:09,261 --> 00:18:12,738
>> HELLO!
I NEED $400.

272
00:18:14,257 --> 00:18:18,821
>> OH A LITTLE CAMEO FROM
ELIZABETH AS SHE BIT YOU.

273
00:18:18,821 --> 00:18:21,210
SORRY, A LOT OF TROUBLE THERE.

274
00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:23,706
>> WHAT'S YOUR QUESTION, MAN?

275
00:18:23,706 --> 00:18:25,719
>> NO QUESTION.

276
00:18:25,719 --> 00:18:28,114
I JUST WANTED TO MAKE YOU WATCH
THAT CLIP.

277
00:18:28,114 --> 00:18:31,639
BUT YOUR PRIZE FOR WATCHING IT
IS A CHAIR.

278
00:18:31,639 --> 00:18:33,299
WHY DON'T YOU TAKE A SEAT, RON?

279
00:18:33,299 --> 00:18:37,164
>> OH, THANK GOD.
OH, MY GOD, THAT'S HUGE.

280
00:18:37,164 --> 00:18:41,384
THIS CHANGES EVERYTHING.
OH, THAT'S SO HUGE.

281
00:18:42,937 --> 00:18:47,371
>> ALL RIGHT, KENNETH, FOR AN
OPPORTUNITY TO STEAL THE CHAIR --

282
00:18:47,371 --> 00:18:50,898
WHICH OF THESE
INDIVIDUALS GAVE YOU THAT BLACK
EYE?

283
00:18:50,898 --> 00:18:54,485
WAS IT "A," THIS OLDER WOMAN?

284
00:18:54,485 --> 00:18:57,642
B, THIS LITTLE BOY?

285
00:18:57,642 --> 00:19:01,046
OR "C," A STOP SIGN?

286
00:19:02,873 --> 00:19:04,898
>> UH -- I MEAN, NONE OF THEM
ARE GOOD.

287
00:19:04,898 --> 00:19:08,205
BUT -- I GUESS I'LL SAY THE
LADY.

288
00:19:08,205 --> 00:19:10,948
>> NO.
THE LITTLE BOY.

289
00:19:10,948 --> 00:19:13,034
YOU STOLE HIS COSTUME.

290
00:19:13,034 --> 00:19:17,175
>> I WAS WONDERING WHY I WAS
DRESSED AS A CORN.
OKAY.

291
00:19:17,175 --> 00:19:18,946
>> ALL RIGHT.

292
00:19:20,523 --> 00:19:24,255
LAST UP IS ELIZABETH FOR A
CHANCE AT THE GRAND PRIZE.

293
00:19:24,255 --> 00:19:26,755
THE BACON, EGG AND CHEESE

294
00:19:26,755 --> 00:19:29,258
AND THE PEDIALYTE.

295
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:32,822
>> WHO DID YOU MAKE OUT WITH
LAST NIGHT?

296
00:19:32,822 --> 00:19:35,541
SAME OPTIONS AS BEFORE.

297
00:19:36,207 --> 00:19:41,280
OLD LADY, LITTLE BOY, STOP SIGN.

298
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,507
>> I WOKE UP WITH A CHIPPED
TOOTH.
GOT TO BE THE STOP SIGN.

299
00:19:44,507 --> 00:19:48,373
>> THAT IS RIGHT, YOU TRASH CAT,
GET OVER HERE.

300
00:19:48,674 --> 00:19:51,049
OH, WELL, THAT'S OUR TIME FOR
TODAY.

301
00:19:51,049 --> 00:19:54,383
I AM GAY FOPAY.
THANKS FOR WATCHING.

302
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:05,581
>>> THIS WEEK ON A VERY SPECIAL
EPISODE OF "PROPERTY BROTHERS."

303
00:20:05,581 --> 00:20:08,101
>> I'M DREW SCOTT, AND I'M A
REAL ESTATE EXPERT.

304
00:20:08,101 --> 00:20:10,760
>> I'M HIS TWIN BROTHER
JONATHAN, AND I'M A CONTRACTOR.

305
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:13,161
THAT MEANS I FIND THE PERFECT
PROPERTY --

306
00:20:13,161 --> 00:20:16,322
>> AND I ACTUALLY HAVE TO
RENOVATE THE DARN THING.

307
00:20:16,681 --> 00:20:19,452
>> THIS WEEK, WE'RE TAKING ON
OUR BIGGEST CHALLENGE YET --

308
00:20:19,452 --> 00:20:22,688
>> BUILDING THE NEW WHITE HOUSE
BALLROOM.

309
00:20:22,688 --> 00:20:25,861
- HI. THE PROPERTY BROTHERS.
- NICE.

310
00:20:25,861 --> 00:20:30,294
SO WHICH ONE OF YOU MARRIED THE
NEW GIRL, AND WHICH ONE OF YOU'S
THE GAY?

311
00:20:30,294 --> 00:20:31,951
>> I MARRIED THE NEW GIRL.

312
00:20:31,951 --> 00:20:35,135
>> DONALD AND MELANIA MOVED INTO
THIS HOUSE NINE YEARS AGO.

313
00:20:35,135 --> 00:20:38,269
THEY WERE EVICTED FOR FOUR
YEARS, BUT THEY MOVED BACK IN.

314
00:20:38,269 --> 00:20:41,259
DONALD HAS A STRONG EYE FOR
INTERIOR DESIGN.

315
00:20:41,259 --> 00:20:44,208
>> I PUT THESE GOLD URNS
EVERYWHERE.

316
00:20:44,208 --> 00:20:45,989
LIKE A HUNDRED IN EVERY ROOM.

317
00:20:45,989 --> 00:20:49,630
THAT MAKES ME HAPPY.
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO BE HAPPY
THESE DAYS.

318
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:52,768
REALLY DARK STUFF HAPPENING IN
THE WORLD.
SOME OF IT ME.

319
00:20:52,768 --> 00:20:57,385
AND HERE'S A CROWN I JUST GOT
FROM MY TRIP TO ASIA.

320
00:20:57,385 --> 00:21:00,557
NOTHING SAYS DEMOCRACY LIKE A
CROWN, RIGHT?

321
00:21:00,557 --> 00:21:03,774
>> AND HIS WIFE, MELANIA, SHE'S
GOT A STYLE ALL HER OWN.

322
00:21:03,774 --> 00:21:06,402
>> I LOVE THIS HALLOWEEN
DECORATIONS YOU PUT UP.

323
00:21:06,402 --> 00:21:09,088
>> THAT'S FOR CHRISTMAS.

324
00:21:09,389 --> 00:21:13,192
>> THE TRUMPS HAVE ALREADY MADE
A FEW SUBTLE CHANGES TO THE
HOUSE.

325
00:21:13,193 --> 00:21:16,122
FDR

326
00:21:16,122 --> 00:21:20,422
AND PUT A PAINTING OF
HIMSELF AS A SOLDIER FROM
HALO.

327
00:21:20,423 --> 00:21:22,111
LEARNED

328
00:21:22,111 --> 00:21:24,871
YOU KNOW YOU CAN'T SAY MASTER
CHIEF ANYMORE.
RIGHT?

329
00:21:24,871 --> 00:21:26,611
YOU'VE GOT TO SAY PRIMARY CHIEF.

330
00:21:26,611 --> 00:21:29,738
>> THEY ALSO PAVED THE ROSE
GARDEN AND TURNED IT INTO WHAT LOOKS LIKE

331
00:21:29,738 --> 00:21:31,506
 OUTDOOR SKATING AT AN
OLIVE GARDEN.

332
00:21:31,506 --> 00:21:34,636
DONALD AND MELANIA STILL FEEL
LIKE SOMETHING'S MISSING.

333
00:21:34,636 --> 00:21:37,754
>> THE HOUSE IS ONLY 55,000
SQUARE FEET.

334
00:21:37,754 --> 00:21:39,720
AND 132 ROOMS.

335
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:41,332
>> WE NEED MORE SPACE!

336
00:21:41,332 --> 00:21:43,784
RIGHT?
WE NEED MORE SPACE!

337
00:21:43,784 --> 00:21:47,457
>> WE NEED A BALLROOM BECAUSE
DONALD, HE LOVES TO DANCE.

338
00:21:47,457 --> 00:21:49,857
>> I'M A TERRIFIC DANCER.
TERRIFIC DANCER.

339
00:21:49,857 --> 00:21:52,712
JUST ASK YOUR EYES.

340
00:21:54,134 --> 00:21:56,215
>> WE ASKED DONALD WHAT HIS
BUDGET WAS,

341
00:21:56,215 --> 00:21:59,483
 AND HE SAID BETWEEN
$350 MILLION AND INFINITY.

342
00:21:59,483 --> 00:22:01,541
THEN WE ASKED IF HE NEEDED A PERMIT, 

343
00:22:01,541 --> 00:22:03,189
AND DONALD LAUGHED
REALLY HARD.

344
00:22:03,189 --> 00:22:07,728
HE SAID, I COULD BUILD THIS
BALLROOM WITH THE BONES OF MY ENEMIES, 
AND NO ONE COULD STOP ME, 

345
00:22:07,728 --> 00:22:10,279
AS OPPOSED TO A BONEHEAD
LIKE MY BROTHER.

346
00:22:10,279 --> 00:22:11,887
>> OH, YOU HUSH UP.

347
00:22:12,506 --> 00:22:22,189
>> WE SHOWED DONALD OUR PLAN FOR

348
00:22:22,191 --> 00:22:23,791
A BALLROOM THAT WOULD MATCH THE

349
00:22:23,793 --> 00:22:24,959
CURRENT PROPORTIONS, BUT HE KEPT

350
00:22:24,961 --> 00:22:27,461
CLICKING "ENLARGE."

351
00:22:27,463 --> 00:22:28,863
>> THEY CAN DRIVE AROUND IT.

352
00:22:28,865 --> 00:22:29,530
OH, I WANT A RING FOR MMA

353
00:22:29,532 --> 00:22:31,265
FIGHTS.

354
00:22:31,267 --> 00:22:31,999
OFFICIAL ONES BUT ALSO CASUAL

355
00:22:32,001 --> 00:22:32,767
FIGHTS IN THE BACKYARD, YOU KNOW

356
00:22:32,769 --> 00:22:34,001
WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT?

357
00:22:34,003 --> 00:22:35,002
TWO MENTALLY ILL GUYS JUST

358
00:22:35,004 --> 00:22:36,270
WHALING ON EACH OTHER.

359
00:22:36,272 --> 00:22:37,505
DO BUM FIGHTS AGAIN.

360
00:22:37,507 --> 00:22:38,506
REMEMBER BUM FIGHTS?

361
00:22:38,508 --> 00:22:43,911
WE LOVE BUM FIGHTS!

362
00:22:43,913 --> 00:22:46,180
>> TO NAIL DOWN THE STYLE OF THE

363
00:22:46,182 --> 00:22:48,449
BALLROOM, WE ASKED DONALD TO

364
00:22:48,451 --> 00:22:51,018
COME UP WITH A BOARD.

365
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:52,686
>> THIS KIND OF GUY AND THIS

366
00:22:52,688 --> 00:22:53,587
GUY -- I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE

367
00:22:53,589 --> 00:22:54,889
MET HIM, BUT HE'S A GREAT GUY.

368
00:22:54,891 --> 00:22:55,623
THEN SOMETHING LIKE THIS COULD

369
00:22:55,625 --> 00:22:57,158
ALSO BE NICE.

370
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:57,892
>> I TOLD DONALD OUR NUMBER ONE

371
00:22:57,894 --> 00:22:58,592
PRIORITY WAS TO PRESERVE THE

372
00:22:58,594 --> 00:22:59,326
HISTORIC NATURE OF THE BUILDING.

373
00:22:59,328 --> 00:23:00,361
HE SENT ME BACK THIS GIF.

374
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:01,829
WE DEMOLISHED THE ENTIRE EAST

375
00:23:01,831 --> 00:23:06,367
WING IN TWO DAYS.

376
00:23:06,369 --> 00:23:08,135
WITH THE GOVERNMENT STILL SHUT

377
00:23:08,137 --> 00:23:09,403
DOWN AND SO MANY WORKERS

378
00:23:09,405 --> 00:23:10,137
FURLOUGHED, WE WERE ABLE TO

379
00:23:10,139 --> 00:23:10,871
FORCE PARK RANGERS AND

380
00:23:10,873 --> 00:23:14,375
ASTRONAUTS TO DO A LOT OF THE

381
00:23:14,377 --> 00:23:15,409
CHEM DEMOLITION.

382
00:23:15,411 --> 00:23:16,077
>> WERE YOU SAD TO LOSE THE

383
00:23:16,079 --> 00:23:16,744
HISTORIC PRESIDENTIAL MOVIE

384
00:23:16,746 --> 00:23:18,112
THEATER?

385
00:23:18,114 --> 00:23:18,846
BILL CLINTON CALLED IT THE BEST

386
00:23:18,848 --> 00:23:21,015
PERK OF BEING PRESIDENT.

387
00:23:21,017 --> 00:23:22,783
>> BILL CLINTON SAID THAT?

388
00:23:22,785 --> 00:23:23,484
HE SAID THE BEST PERK FOR HIM

389
00:23:23,486 --> 00:23:24,819
WAS THE MOVIE THEATER?

390
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:28,489
>> UNFORTUNATELY THE RENOVATION

391
00:23:28,491 --> 00:23:29,256
HIT A BIT OF A SNAG WHEN DONALD

392
00:23:29,258 --> 00:23:31,025
REALIZED HE HAD DEPORTED ALL THE

393
00:23:31,027 --> 00:23:32,259
CONSTRUCTION WORKERS AND PULLED

394
00:23:32,261 --> 00:23:33,494
INTO THE HOME DEPOT PARKING LOT

395
00:23:33,496 --> 00:23:34,261
AND YELLED, "JUST GIVE ME THE

396
00:23:34,263 --> 00:23:36,997
WHITES."

397
00:23:36,999 --> 00:23:38,265
I WANT THE DAY LABORERS FROM

398
00:23:38,267 --> 00:23:39,767
NORWAY AND SWEDEN, BUT

399
00:23:39,769 --> 00:23:43,971
APPARENTLY THEY DON'T EXIST.

400
00:23:43,973 --> 00:23:45,873
>> BUT IN THE END, WE'RE

401
00:23:45,875 --> 00:23:46,640
CONFIDENT THE NEW BALLROOM WILL

402
00:23:46,642 --> 00:23:47,374
BE A SHINING BEACON OF FREEDOM

403
00:23:47,376 --> 00:23:48,142
FOR ALL AMERICANS.

404
00:23:48,144 --> 00:23:48,876
>> AND IT WILL BE READY JUST IN

405
00:23:48,878 --> 00:23:49,877
TIME FOR MY THIRD TERM.

406
00:23:49,879 --> 00:23:51,145
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

407
00:23:51,147 --> 00:23:52,146
WE WANT THIS TO BE OUR FOREVER

408
00:23:52,148 --> 00:23:52,880
HOME.

409
00:23:52,882 --> 00:23:53,614
>> YES, BECAUSE WE'RE NOT

410
00:23:53,616 --> 00:23:54,381
LEAVING.

411
00:23:54,383 --> 00:23:55,382
WE'RE GOING TO BE DOING

412
00:23:55,384 --> 00:23:57,251
SOMETHING CALLED COUP.

413
00:24:01,757 --> 00:24:02,490
>> AND WE'LL MAKE SURE THAT

414
00:24:02,492 --> 00:24:03,224
TRUMP'S DREAM BECOMES A REALITY.

415
00:24:03,226 --> 00:24:03,958
IF MY DUMB BROTHER DOESN'T SCREW

416
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:04,258
IT UP.

417
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:04,758
>> SERIOUSLY?

418
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:07,761
[ BLEEP ] YOU.

419
00:24:07,763 --> 00:24:09,530
>> THANK YOU SO MUCH.

420
00:24:09,532 --> 00:24:10,264
>> OKAY, I GUESS THE ONLY THING

421
00:24:10,266 --> 00:24:11,265
LEFT IS THE PAYMENT FOR THE

422
00:24:11,267 --> 00:24:11,732
CONSTRUCTION.

423
00:24:11,734 --> 00:24:12,766
>> AREN'T YOU GUYS FROM CANADA?

424
00:24:12,768 --> 00:24:14,001

630
00:29:49,205 --> 00:29:49,536
MONTHS.

631
00:29:49,538 --> 00:29:52,339
>> I WAS LITERALLY IN THE

632
00:29:52,341 --> 00:29:52,706
BATHROOM.

633
00:29:52,708 --> 00:29:55,509
DUMPING IF YOU WANT TO KNOW.

634
00:29:55,511 --> 00:29:56,877
>> "GONE WITHOUT A TRACE."

635
00:29:56,879 --> 00:29:57,678
>> WHOEVER TOOK HER LEFT A BUNCH

636
00:29:57,680 --> 00:30:00,981
OF CRYPTIC NOTES.

637
00:30:00,983 --> 00:30:04,117
>> HEAT AT 450 FOR 20 MINUTES.

638
00:30:04,119 --> 00:30:05,452
PLEASE PUT LAUNDRY IN THE DRYER.

639
00:30:05,454 --> 00:30:07,688
IS THIS A GAME TO YOU?

640
00:30:07,690 --> 00:30:13,327
>> THE WHOLE WORLD WAS AGAINST

641
00:30:13,329 --> 00:30:13,594
ME.

642
00:30:13,596 --> 00:30:15,095
>> WHAT THE HELL DO YOU EAT,

643
00:30:15,097 --> 00:30:15,362
MAN?

644
00:30:15,364 --> 00:30:16,296
>> SHE WAS GONE FOR WHAT FELT

645
00:30:16,298 --> 00:30:17,164
LIKE A LIFETIME.

646
00:30:17,166 --> 00:30:17,865
>> I DID TAKE A SHOWER AFTER.

647
00:30:17,867 --> 00:30:21,969
HAD TO.

648
00:30:21,971 --> 00:30:22,369
>> NO CLUES.

649
00:30:22,371 --> 00:30:26,406
NOTHING.

650
00:30:26,408 --> 00:30:31,745
>> IT WAS FUN AT FIRST.

651
00:30:31,747 --> 00:30:32,446
THAT'S WHEN THINGS GOT REALLY

652
00:30:32,448 --> 00:30:39,653
BAD.

653
00:30:39,655 --> 00:30:41,054
>> THE POLICE ASKED ME FOR A

654
00:30:41,056 --> 00:30:42,155
PHOTO OF HER, BUT MY PHONE WAS

655
00:30:42,157 --> 00:30:45,792
DEAD SO I HAD TO DRAW HER.

656
00:30:45,794 --> 00:30:47,594
SHE'S JUST AS BEAUTIFUL IN REAL

657
00:30:47,596 --> 00:30:47,895
LIFE.

658
00:30:47,897 --> 00:30:49,263
>> FEEL LIKE I HAVE A LITTLE

659
00:30:49,265 --> 00:30:49,963
MORE OF A CHIN.

660
00:30:49,965 --> 00:30:52,099
>> OKAY, WHAT IS YOUR WIFE'S

661
00:30:52,101 --> 00:30:52,466
FULL NAME?

662
00:30:52,468 --> 00:30:53,100
>> MEGAN.

663
00:30:53,102 --> 00:30:54,468
>> WHEN'S HER BIRTHDAY?

664
00:30:54,470 --> 00:30:55,736
>> SUMMER.

665
00:30:55,738 --> 00:30:56,970
>> DID YOU CONTACT HER PARENTS?

666
00:30:56,972 --> 00:30:58,305
>> YES, I CALLED THEM AND SAID,

667
00:30:58,307 --> 00:31:01,775
YOUR DAUGHTER IS DEAD.

668
00:31:01,777 --> 00:31:04,711
>> I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT I WAS

669
00:31:04,713 --> 00:31:05,012
DOING.

670
00:31:05,014 --> 00:31:06,113
SOMEBODY TOOK MY WIFE!

671
00:31:06,115 --> 00:31:09,816
I HAVE A GUN, AND I'M NOT -- OH!

672
00:31:09,818 --> 00:31:12,286
>> AND NOT LONG AFTER SHE LEFT,

673
00:31:12,288 --> 00:31:13,687
THESE TWO SMALL MEN CAME OUT THE

674
00:31:13,689 --> 00:31:14,054
BASEMENT.

675
00:31:14,056 --> 00:31:15,088
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

676
00:31:15,090 --> 00:31:16,490
WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?

677
00:31:16,492 --> 00:31:20,127
>> OUR SONS.

678
00:31:20,129 --> 00:31:21,828
I THINK YOU FORGOT WE HAVE KIDS.

679
00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:23,897
>> NO, NO!

680
00:31:23,899 --> 00:31:25,899
>> AFTER ABOUT 24 HOURS, I DID

681
00:31:25,901 --> 00:31:28,268
DECIDE IT WAS TIME TO MOVE ON

682
00:31:28,270 --> 00:31:28,702
ROMANTICALLY.

683
00:31:28,704 --> 00:31:34,741
SO I DOWNLOADED TINDER.

684
00:31:34,743 --> 00:31:36,276
>> THERE WAS NO WAY I COULD HAVE

685
00:31:36,278 --> 00:31:36,610
KNOWN.

686
00:31:36,612 --> 00:31:37,878
>> I'M TELLING YOU NOW, I'M

687
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:39,780
GOING TO SEE MY SISTER IN

688
00:31:39,782 --> 00:31:40,213
POUGHKEEPSIE.

689
00:31:40,215 --> 00:31:41,014
>> OKAY, BABY, HAVE FUN.

690
00:31:41,016 --> 00:31:42,316
>> I'LL BE BACK SUNDAY.

691
00:31:42,318 --> 00:31:42,916
SUNDAY NIGHT.

692
00:31:42,918 --> 00:31:43,283
>> OKAY.

693
00:31:43,285 --> 00:31:45,152
>> WHERE AM I GOING?

694
00:31:45,154 --> 00:31:46,420
>> POUGHKEEPSIE.

695
00:31:46,422 --> 00:31:48,388
>> SIR, IS THERE ANY PLACE YOU

696
00:31:48,390 --> 00:31:49,323
THINK SHE COULD BE?

697
00:31:49,325 --> 00:31:50,757
>> I KNOW THIS IS PROBABLY

698
00:31:50,759 --> 00:31:54,294
WRONG, BUT -- MAYBE THE BOOB

699
00:31:54,296 --> 00:31:54,595
STORE?

700
00:31:54,597 --> 00:31:57,164
>> "GONE WITH SEVERAL TRACES."

701
00:31:57,166 --> 00:32:01,168
>> SOMETIMES THE SCARIEST THING

702
00:32:01,170 --> 00:32:02,469
IS WHEN -- STEP BACK, NO!

703
00:32:11,981 --> 00:32:15,182
>>> GOOD EVENING, AND WELCOME TO

704
00:32:15,184 --> 00:32:15,582
NEWSPOINT.

705
00:32:15,584 --> 00:32:16,383
I'M DAPHNE DODD.

706
00:32:16,385 --> 00:32:18,185
MY GUEST TONIGHT IS ECONOMIST

707
00:32:18,187 --> 00:32:18,785
P.L. HENRY.

708
00:32:18,787 --> 00:32:19,620
>> EVENING.

709
00:32:19,622 --> 00:32:20,687
>> IF IT LOOKS A LITTLE

710
00:32:20,689 --> 00:32:21,822
DIFFERENT IN HERE, THAT'S

711
00:32:21,824 --> 00:32:23,290
BECAUSE IT'S OUR FIRST SHOW IN

712
00:32:23,292 --> 00:32:24,625
OUR BRAND-NEW SET THAT GIVES YOU

713
00:32:24,627 --> 00:32:26,927
A PEEK INSIDE OUR NEWSROOM AND

714
00:32:26,929 --> 00:32:28,629
THE HARD-WORKING FOLKS WHO PUT

715
00:32:28,631 --> 00:32:29,896
ALL THIS TOGETHER.

716
00:32:29,898 --> 00:32:31,131
WELL, LOTS TO DISCUSS TONIGHT.

717
00:32:31,133 --> 00:32:33,200
WE START WITH THE ECONOMY, WHICH

718
00:32:33,202 --> 00:32:36,937
WE'RE PUTTING "IN FOCUS."

719
00:32:36,939 --> 00:32:38,639
THIS WEEK, AMAZON ANNOUNCED

720
00:32:38,641 --> 00:32:40,240
THOUSANDS OF LAYOFFS WITH TARGET

721
00:32:40,242 --> 00:32:43,910
ALSO JOINING THE LIST OF MAJOR

722
00:32:43,912 --> 00:32:45,646
COMPANIES SLASHING ITS

723
00:32:45,648 --> 00:32:46,013
WORKFORCE.

724
00:32:46,015 --> 00:32:47,147
WHILE COMPANIES LOOK TO PROTECT

725
00:32:47,149 --> 00:32:48,015
THEIR BOTTOM LINES, AMERICAN

726
00:32:48,017 --> 00:32:51,084
HOUSEHOLDS ARE DOING THE SAME.

727
00:32:55,691 --> 00:32:56,857
>> OH!

728
00:32:56,859 --> 00:32:57,924
>> ARE YOU OKAY?

729
00:32:57,926 --> 00:32:58,625
>> YEAH, I'M FINE, I'M SORRY.

730
00:32:58,627 --> 00:32:59,426
OH!

731
00:32:59,428 --> 00:33:02,763
>> OKAY.

732
00:33:02,765 --> 00:33:04,698
RISING PRICES FOR GROCERIES AND

733
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:05,098
UTILITIES --

734
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:07,968
>> OH!

735
00:33:07,970 --> 00:33:10,537
OH!

736
00:33:10,539 --> 00:33:10,904
I'M SORRY.

737
00:33:10,906 --> 00:33:11,271
I'M FINE.

738
00:33:11,273 --> 00:33:13,206
I APOLOGIZE.

739
00:33:13,208 --> 00:33:14,808
>> APOLOGIES FOR THAT.

740
00:33:14,810 --> 00:33:15,776
THE BIG QUESTION HERE, IS THIS

741
00:33:15,778 --> 00:33:18,111
THE START OF A LONGER, STEEPER

742
00:33:18,113 --> 00:33:18,445
DECLINE?

743
00:33:18,447 --> 00:33:20,947
>> WELL, DAPHNE, THAT'S UP TO

744
00:33:20,949 --> 00:33:22,849
HOW MUCH OF THIS OVERHEATED A.I.

745
00:33:22,851 --> 00:33:23,984
SECTOR IS EVEN REAL.

746
00:33:23,986 --> 00:33:25,919
IF IT'S A BUBBLE, IT'S GOING TO

747
00:33:25,921 --> 00:33:26,553
BURST SOONER OR LATER.

748
00:33:26,555 --> 00:33:27,754
>> LET'S HOPE IT DOESN'T BURST,

749
00:33:27,756 --> 00:33:29,322
WE JUST SPENT A LOT OF MONEY ON

750
00:33:29,324 --> 00:33:30,290
THIS NEW STUDIO.

751
00:33:30,292 --> 00:33:32,259
>> HEY, WHOEVER REPORTED ME TO

752
00:33:32,261 --> 00:33:33,026
HR, SAY IT TO MY FACE NEXT TIME!

753
00:33:36,699 --> 00:33:39,332
>> SORRY.

754
00:33:39,334 --> 00:33:41,101
STILL ADJUSTING TO THE NEW

755
00:33:41,103 --> 00:33:41,435
LAYOUT.

756
00:33:41,437 --> 00:33:42,669
>> ACTUALLY, I THINK IT'S QUITE

757
00:33:42,671 --> 00:33:45,605
AN UPGRADE.

758
00:33:45,607 --> 00:33:46,339
SUCH A FUN LITTLE TREAT FOR THE

759
00:33:46,341 --> 00:33:47,040
VIEWERS TO GET A LITTLE PEEK

760
00:33:47,042 --> 00:33:47,574
BEHIND THE CURTAIN.

761
00:33:50,279 --> 00:33:52,045
>> PROFESSOR, NOW, WHAT DO YOU

762
00:33:52,047 --> 00:33:52,879
MAKE OF THIS?

763
00:33:52,881 --> 00:33:53,580
BECAUSE ON PAPER, INFLATION

764
00:33:53,582 --> 00:33:58,719
RATES ARE PRETTY LOW.

765
00:33:59,822 --> 00:34:02,089
>> WELL, ON THE SCREEN,

766
00:34:02,091 --> 00:34:02,756
INFLATION RATES SEEM PRETTY

767
00:34:02,758 --> 00:34:03,056
HUGE.

768
00:34:10,065 --> 00:34:12,933
>> ALL RIGHT, SOMEONE HACKED MY

769
00:34:12,935 --> 00:34:14,901
COMMUNITY, PUT MANGA ROCK ON IT

770
00:34:14,903 --> 00:34:15,235
AGAIN.

771
00:34:15,237 --> 00:34:16,403
>> YEAH, SURE, BUDDY.

772
00:34:16,405 --> 00:34:18,705
BUT LOOK, PRICES ARE RISING, BUT

773
00:34:18,707 --> 00:34:20,173
SO ARE THE MARKETS.

774
00:34:20,175 --> 00:34:20,807
WE'RE STILL SOLID.

775
00:34:20,809 --> 00:34:21,942
>> EVERYDAY AMERICANS ARE

776
00:34:21,944 --> 00:34:22,976
CERTAINLY STRUGGLING.

777
00:34:22,978 --> 00:34:24,778
RESULTS FROM A NEW SURVEY SHOWED

778
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:26,179
52% OF AMERICANS ARE LIVING

779
00:34:26,181 --> 00:34:31,284
PAYCHECK TO PAYCHECK.

780
00:34:31,286 --> 00:34:33,420
>> OH, SAO PAULO MARKETS, I DO

781
00:34:33,422 --> 00:34:35,822
IT ALL, BABY, PACKING IT --

782
00:34:35,824 --> 00:34:37,023
>> SORRY.

783
00:34:37,025 --> 00:34:38,191
HECTIC NEWS DAY.

784
00:34:38,193 --> 00:34:39,626
AND THIS IS CONCERNING.

785
00:34:39,628 --> 00:34:42,696
1 IN 3 AMERICANS DESCRIBE THEIR

786
00:34:42,698 --> 00:34:44,030
FINANCIAL SITUATION AS IN

787
00:34:44,032 --> 00:34:44,364
CRISIS.

788
00:34:44,366 --> 00:34:45,599
IS THIS JUST THE BEGINNING,

789
00:34:45,601 --> 00:34:45,966
PROFESSOR?

790
00:34:45,968 --> 00:34:50,570
>> WELL, I THINK WE'LL SEE -- I

791
00:34:50,572 --> 00:34:52,639
THINK WE'LL SEE MORE LAYOFFS AND

792
00:34:52,641 --> 00:34:56,076
PRICE HIKES, BUT THE CEILING IS

793
00:34:56,078 --> 00:34:57,778
RAISING THE PRICE -- HEY, EXCUSE

794
00:34:57,780 --> 00:34:58,812
ME, DFNY.

795
00:34:58,814 --> 00:35:02,349
JUST TAKE THE PAPER OUT THE

796
00:35:02,351 --> 00:35:02,649
TRAY!

797
00:35:02,651 --> 00:35:03,350
>> PROFESSOR, YOU WERE SAYING?

798
00:35:03,352 --> 00:35:05,385
>> SORRY.

799

FIRST LADY HOSTED A

925
00:41:42,350 --> 00:41:43,383
TRICK-OR-TREAT EVENT AT WHAT'S

LEFT OF THE WHITE HOUSE.

927
00:41:45,253 --> 00:41:46,019
AND THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE

928
00:41:46,021 --> 00:41:47,253
THINGS THAT THE PRESIDENT DOES

929
00:41:47,255 --> 00:41:49,155
BECAUSE IT'S SO CLEAR HE NEVER

930
00:41:49,157 --> 00:41:50,757
TRICK-OR-TREATED ONCE IN HIS

931

LIFE.

932
00:41:51,126 --> 00:41:52,926
IN HIS FIRST TERM, HERE'S HOW HE

933
00:41:52,928 --> 00:41:53,760
GAVE CANDY TO A KID DRESSED AS A

934
00:41:53,762 --> 00:41:57,297
MINION.

935
00:42:04,105 --> 00:42:05,538
MELANIA'S JUST LIKE, I GUESS

936
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:06,639
THAT IS HOW IT'S DONE.

937
00:42:07,042 --> 00:42:08,241
THEN AGAIN THIS YEAR, HE DID IT

938
00:42:08,243 --> 00:42:09,242
TO A KID DRESSED AS DJ

939
00:42:09,244 --> 00:42:17,817
MARSHMALLOW.

940
00:42:18,219 --> 00:42:20,954
JUST PUT IT IN THE BAG.

941
00:42:20,956 --> 00:42:21,854
WHY IS HE SO WEIRD?

942
00:42:21,856 --> 00:42:24,057
EVEN THE KID IS LIKE, THIS IS

943
00:42:24,059 --> 00:42:25,391
NOT RIGHT.

944
00:42:25,794 --> 00:42:27,493
IT'S KIND OF AN EMBODIMENT OF

945
00:42:27,495 --> 00:42:28,761
HIS SPIRE PRESIDENCY, BECAUSE

946
00:42:28,763 --> 00:42:30,496
IT'S JUST A VIOLATION OF NORMS

947
00:42:30,498 --> 00:42:32,532
THAT NO OTHER PRESIDENT OR

948
00:42:32,534 --> 00:42:34,534
PERSON HAS EVER CONCEIVED OF.

949
00:42:34,536 --> 00:42:35,468
LIKE, WHO'S EVER THOUGHT, I

950
00:42:35,470 --> 00:42:36,135
SHOULD PUT THE CANDY ON THE

951

KID'S HEAD.

952
00:42:38,573 --> 00:42:39,806
MY FAVORE PART, THOUGH, IS

953
00:42:39,808 --> 00:42:41,307
WHEN TRUMP AND MELANIA MADE A

954
00:42:41,309 --> 00:42:43,142
GRAND ENTRANCE TO THIS SONG.

THIS, BUT THANK GOD NOBODY

972
00:43:30,225 --> 00:43:32,925
LISTENS TO WOMEN.

973
00:43:39,067 --> 00:43:40,500
>>> PRESIDENT TRUMP MET WITH

974
00:43:40,502 --> 00:43:41,367
CHINESE PRESIDENT XI JINPING.

975
00:43:41,369 --> 00:43:42,869
WHEN ASKED HOW THE MEETING WENT,

976
00:43:42,871 --> 00:43:43,503
TRUMP SAID THIS.

977
00:43:43,505 --> 00:43:45,471
>> BUT OVERALL, I GUESS ON THE

978
00:43:45,473 --> 00:43:47,540
SCALE FROM 0 TO 10 WITH 10 BEING

979
00:43:47,542 --> 00:43:48,007
THE PEST?

980
00:43:48,009 --> 00:43:48,708
I WOULD SAY THE MEETING WAS A

981
00:43:48,710 --> 00:43:49,275
12.

982
00:43:52,647 --> 00:43:54,080
>> I GUESS TRUMP JUST WANTED TO

983
00:43:54,082 --> 00:43:55,314
SHOW CHINA WE'RE STILL WAY WORSE

984
00:43:55,316 --> 00:43:55,648
AT MATH.

985
00:44:00,422 --> 00:44:02,055
TRUMP ALSO VISITED SOUTH KOREA

986
00:44:02,057 --> 00:44:04,290
AND WAS GIVEN A GOLD CROWN AND

987
00:44:04,292 --> 00:44:06,225
SERVED BEEF PATTIES WITH KETCHUP

988
00:44:06,227 --> 00:44:07,060
FOR DINNER.

989
00:44:07,062 --> 00:44:08,127
SO THEY BASICALLY GOT THE

990
00:44:08,129 --> 00:44:09,395
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES A

991
00:44:09,397 --> 00:44:09,962
HAPPY MEAL WITH A TOY.

992
00:44:13,635 --> 00:44:15,401
>>> CRITICS OF PRESIDENT TRUMP

993
00:44:15,403 --> 00:44:17,036

DURING THE GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN.

997
00:44:22,077 --> 00:44:23,443
BUT I'M HAPPY THAT THE FLOOR

998
00:44:23,445 --> 00:44:23,910
LOOKS SLIPPERY.

999
00:44:31,119 --> 00:44:34,253
>>> THE STATE OF TEXAS IS SUING

1000
00:44:34,255 --> 00:44:35,321
TYLENOL, CLAIMING THAT IT IS

1001
00:44:35,323 --> 00:44:36,289
LINKED TO AUTISM.

1002
00:44:36,291 --> 00:44:37,657
OR AS IT'S CALLED IN TEXAS, BOY

1003
00:44:37,659 --> 00:44:38,057

GIULIANI.

1010
00:44:55,543 --> 00:44:56,576
GIULIANI ONLY LIKES HIM BECAUSE

1011
00:44:56,578 --> 00:44:57,343
HIS POLL NUMBERS ARE BETWEEN 9

1012

>> WELL, YEAH, PRISON WAS CRAZY.

1036
00:45:46,795 --> 00:45:48,361
I WAS IN A ROOM BY MYSELF

1037
00:45:48,363 --> 00:45:50,763
TALKING TO PEOPLE THROUGH A

1038
