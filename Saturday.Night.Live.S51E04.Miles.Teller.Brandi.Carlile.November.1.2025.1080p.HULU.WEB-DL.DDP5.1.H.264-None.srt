1
00:00:00,162 --> 00:00:04,298
>>> YOU'RE WATCHING NEW YORK 1,
NEW YORK'S NUMBER FIVE NEWS
STATION.

2
00:00:09,481 --> 00:00:11,712
>> HELLO.

3
00:00:12,611 --> 00:00:15,282
HELLO AND GOOD EVENING FROM NEW
YORK 1.

4
00:00:15,282 --> 00:00:16,454
YAMMER ROLL LOUIS,

5
00:00:16,454 --> 00:00:21,146
AND I AM NOW OFFICIALLY THE LEAST FAMOUS
PERSON TO BE IMPERSONATED ON
SNL.

6
00:00:21,146 --> 00:00:24,563
BUT TRUST ME, IT'S UNCANNY.

7
00:00:24,563 --> 00:00:28,163
WE'RE COMING TO YOU LIVE FOR
THIS THE THIRD, FINAL,

8
00:00:28,163 --> 00:00:31,378
AND
FICTIONAL NEW YORK CITY MAYORAL
DEBATE.

9
00:00:31,378 --> 00:00:35,493
TONIGHT'S EVENT IS SPONSORED BY
GRISTINI'S SUPERMARKET.

10
00:00:35,493 --> 00:00:38,544
SAY, WHERE DID YOU GET THAT WET
SANDWICH?

11
00:00:38,544 --> 00:00:40,715
WHY, GRISTITI'S, OF COURSE.

12
00:00:40,715 --> 00:00:42,709
AND BIKE LANES.

13
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:44,935
YOU WANT A NEW WAY TO DIE?

14
00:00:45,247 --> 00:00:47,912
STEP INTO A BIKE LANE.

15
00:00:47,912 --> 00:00:50,885
TONIGHT, WE'RE GOING TO HEAR
FROM TWO VIABLE CANDIDATES

16
00:00:50,885 --> 00:00:53,582
AND
ONE GOOD OLD-FASHIONED NEW YORK
NUT.

17
00:00:53,582 --> 00:00:58,210
FIRST UP, FORMER NEW YORK
GOVERNOR ANDREW CUOMO.

18
00:01:00,526 --> 00:01:03,652
>> HELLO, VOTERS.
YOU ALL KNOW ME.

19
00:01:03,652 --> 00:01:05,402
I GOT US THROUGH COVID, AND THEN

20
00:01:05,402 --> 00:01:09,040
YADA YADA YADA, HONK HONK,
SQUEEZE SQUEEZE.

21
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,777
ANYWAY, I'M BACK.

22
00:01:10,777 --> 00:01:14,246
I'M A BORN AND BRED NEW YORKER.
I LOVE IT HERE.

23
00:01:14,246 --> 00:01:17,364
I KNOW THIS CITY LIKE THE BACK
OF A WOMAN'S BACK,

24
00:01:17,364 --> 00:01:19,543
MAMMA MIA!

25
00:01:20,238 --> 00:01:25,281
>> NEXT WE HAVE THE DEMOCRATIC
NOMINEE, ZOHRAN MAMDANI.

26
00:01:27,121 --> 00:01:30,169
>> HELLO, EVERYONE.
I'M HAPPY TO BE HERE.

27
00:01:30,169 --> 00:01:34,619
AND I'M READY TO SPEND THE NEXT
HOUR HEARING MY OPPONENTS
PRONOUNCE MY NAME

28
00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:37,818
IN WAYS YOU
COULDN'T BEGIN TO IMAGINE.

29
00:01:37,818 --> 00:01:40,647
AND I KNOW SOME OF YOU ARE OUT
THERE SCARED

30
00:01:40,647 --> 00:01:43,417
OF THE IDEA OF A
YOUNG SOCIAL LIST MUSLIM MAYOR,

31
00:01:43,417 --> 00:01:45,027
SO ALLOW ME TO PUT YOU AT EASE --

32
00:01:45,027 --> 00:01:47,626
BY SMILING AFTER EVERY ANSWER

33
00:01:47,626 --> 00:01:51,253
IN A WAY THAT PHYSICALLY
HURTS MY FACE.

34
00:01:54,873 --> 00:01:56,514
>> ALL RIGHT.

35
00:01:56,514 --> 00:01:59,674
AND NOW LET'S DO A FUN ONE.

36
00:02:00,059 --> 00:02:04,125
THE REPUBLICAN NOMINEE, CURTIS
SLIWA.

37
00:02:04,682 --> 00:02:08,896
YES.
MR. SLIWA, YOUR OPENING
STATEMENT?

38
00:02:08,896 --> 00:02:12,696
>> I'M THRILLED TO BE HERE AND
NOT GETTING SHOT IN THE BACK

39
00:02:12,696 --> 00:02:16,391
OF A YELLOW CAB FIVE TIMES
BY THE GOTTIS AND GAMBINOS,

40
00:02:16,391 --> 00:02:22,642
AS I WAS
FAMOUSLY IN 1992, 1993, AND '94.

41
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:25,216
BUT I'M THE RIGHT CHOICE TO BE
YOUR NEXT MAYOR.

42
00:02:25,216 --> 00:02:27,555
NO OFFENSE TO MR. OPPONENTS, MR. CUOMO,

43
00:02:27,555 --> 00:02:31,618
AND I BELIEVE I'M SAYING
THIS RIGHT, ZOLTAR RAMZOMBIE.

44
00:02:34,022 --> 00:02:36,525
>> THAT'S NOT EVEN CLOSE.

45
00:02:36,525 --> 00:02:39,960
>> ALL RIGHT, CANDIDATES, YOU'RE
ALL RUNNING TO BE MAYOR OF NEW
YORK CITY.

46
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:44,906
SO MY QUESTION IS, WHY WOULD YOU
WANT THE WORST JOB IN THE
WORLD?

47
00:02:44,906 --> 00:02:48,355
>> AS WE ALL KNOW, AS SOON AS
YOU ELECTED MAYOR,

48
00:02:48,355 --> 00:02:50,385
EVERYONE IN
THE CITY IMMEDIATELY HATES YOU.

49
00:02:50,385 --> 00:02:54,458
AND IN THAT WAY, I AM ALREADY
ONE STEP AHEAD OF THE GAME.

50
00:02:55,136 --> 00:02:57,310
>> MR. MAMDANI, SAME QUESTION.

51
00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:00,790
>> I WANT TO BE MAYOR SO I CAN
DELIVER A BETTER NEW YORK,

52
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:04,940
FREE
HEALTH CARE, AFFORDABLE HOUSING,
FREE WI-FI.

53
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:07,390
AS MAYOR, CAN I MAKE THAT
HAPPEN?

54
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:09,558
I'M NOT SURE YET.

55
00:03:09,558 --> 00:03:12,477
BUT TOGETHER, WE'RE GOING TO
FIND OUT.

56
00:03:12,477 --> 00:03:15,778
THAT THE ANSWER IS NO.

57
00:03:16,968 --> 00:03:19,088
>> I GOT TO SAY SOMETHING.

58
00:03:19,088 --> 00:03:21,787
MY OPPONENT, NORMAN VANDANIEL,

59
00:03:21,787 --> 00:03:24,856
IS INEXPERIENCED AND FRANKLY A NEPO BABY,

60
00:03:24,856 --> 00:03:28,396
WHERE MY DAD WAS JUST
GOVERNOR OF NEW YORK.

61
00:03:28,396 --> 00:03:32,331
>> OF COURSE, AS YOU KNOW, MY
DAD WAS BRUTALLY KIDNAPPED

62
00:03:32,331 --> 00:03:36,489
AND
TIED TO THE TRACKS OF THE
CYCLONE AT CONEY ISLAND.

63
00:03:37,106 --> 00:03:39,422
I'M SORRY, WHAT WAS YOUR
QUESTION?

64
00:03:39,422 --> 00:03:44,390
>> WHY DO YOU WANT TO BE MAYOR?
>> OH, I NEED A JOB.

65
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:47,484
>> ALL RIGHT, LET'S MOVE ON TO
MOST IMPORTANT QUESTION TONIGHT.

66
00:03:47,484 --> 00:03:50,781
WHAT'S YOUR GO-TO BAGEL ORDER?
MR. MAMDANI?

67
00:03:50,781 --> 00:03:54,948
>> WHAT I'D LIKE IS FOR THE
PERSON SERVING ME THAT BAGEL

68
00:03:54,948 --> 00:03:57,950
TO
BE PAID A LIVING WAGE.

69
00:04:00,123 --> 00:04:04,393
>> BOO!
RELAX, NERD.

70
00:04:04,393 --> 00:04:07,211
MR. CUOMO, GO-TO BAGEL ORDER?

71
00:04:07,211 --> 00:04:11,256
>> I SWEAR TO GOD I AM NOT
SAYING THIS TO PANDER TO JEWISH
VOTERS.

72
00:04:11,256 --> 00:04:15,843
BUT IT'S A GEFILTE FISH EATEN IN
A BOOTH WITH BARBRA STREISAND

73
00:04:15,843 --> 00:04:17,907
BY THE LIGHT OF A MENORAH.

74
00:04:19,442 --> 00:04:22,619
>> ONCE AGAIN, BOO.

75
00:04:22,619 --> 00:04:25,818
MR. SLIWA, GO-TO BAGEL ORDER.

76
00:04:25,818 --> 00:04:29,752
>> AS YOU KNOW, IN 1982, I HAD
MY PENIS CUT OFF

77
00:04:29,752 --> 00:04:32,726
AND FED TO ME
BY THE YAKUZA.

78
00:04:32,726 --> 00:04:37,099
OBVIOUSLY BLUEBERRY BAGEL, STRAWBERRY
CREAM CHEESE

79
00:04:37,099 --> 00:04:39,167
EATEN OVER A GAR
BACK CAN.

80
00:04:39,167 --> 00:04:41,079
>> THANK YOU, CANDIDATES.

81
00:04:41,079 --> 00:04:44,696
TAKE A MOMENT
LET'S THANK A FEW MORE OF
TONIGHT'S SPONSORS,

82
00:04:44,696 --> 00:04:46,143
PEDICABS.

83
00:04:46,143 --> 00:04:50,061
SLOWER THAN WALKING, LOUDER THAN
HELL.

84
00:04:50,061 --> 00:04:51,982
AND HUDSON YARDS.

85
00:04:51,982 --> 00:04:54,644
SHOP, DINE, OR TAKE THE EASY WAY OUT

86
00:04:54,644 --> 00:04:56,755
AT HUDSON YARDS.

87
00:05:00,542 --> 00:05:04,471
MOVING ON.
MOVING ON TO OUR NEXT TOPIC,

88
00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:07,079
WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO SAY TO
UNDECIDED VOTERS?

89
00:05:07,079 --> 00:05:08,974
GOVERNOR CUOMO, LET'S START WITH
YOU.

90
00:05:08,974 --> 00:05:12,472
>> LISTEN, I HAVE ACTUAL
GOVERNING EXPERIENCE.

91
00:05:12,472 --> 00:05:14,905
I HAVE THE RELATIONSHIPS TO GET
THE JOB DONE

92
00:05:14,905 --> 00:05:18,275
AND THE SUPPORT OF
SOME OF THE FINEST PEOPLE IN THE
CITY.

93
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:22,231
>> LIKE ME, MAYOR ERIC ADAMS.

94
00:05:22,231 --> 00:05:25,005
THIS IS MY GUY RIGHT HERE, MAN.
LISTEN UP.

95
00:05:25,005 --> 00:05:27,242
IF YOU LIKE ME, YOU GONNA LOVE
THIS GUY!

96
00:05:27,242 --> 00:05:29,542
HE LIKE ME PART TWO!

97
00:05:29,542 --> 00:05:32,208
>> WELL, NO, ERIC.
REMEMBER THE PLAN.

98
00:05:32,208 --> 00:05:34,463
>> OH, OH, YEAH I GOT YOU.
I GOT YOU.

99
00:05:34,463 --> 00:05:36,864
I, ERIC ADAMS, ENDORSE HIM,

100
00:05:36,928 --> 00:05:39,194
ZORDAN MAMAGRAMMA.

101
00:05:39,956 --> 00:05:42,377
>> NO, NO, NO THANK YOU.

102
00:05:42,377 --> 00:05:46,424
>> MR. MAMDANI, YOUR MESSAGE TO
UNDECIDED VOTERS?

103
00:05:46,424 --> 00:05:49,353
>> MY MESSAGE IS THIS.

104
00:05:51,473 --> 00:05:55,386
HEY, GIRL.
I KNOW YOU GOT A LITTLE WHITE
GUILT

105
00:05:55,386 --> 00:05:58,552
FOR GENTRIFYING THAT
SPANISH NEIGHBORHOOD, DON'T YOU?

106
00:05:58,552 --> 00:06:00,509
WHY DON'T YOU VOTE FOR ME?

107
00:06:00,509 --> 00:06:03,548
YOU KNOW YOU'LL FEEL A LITTLE
LESS BAD ABOUT THAT CHICKEN AND
RICE SHOP

108
00:06:03,548 --> 00:06:05,902
GETTING TURNED INTO A
SWEETGREENS.

109
00:06:05,902 --> 00:06:08,973
WHY DON'T YOU HIT ME UP AT THE
BALLOT BOX, GIRL?

110
00:06:12,122 --> 00:06:14,494
>> MR. MAMDANI,

111
00:06:14,494 --> 00:06:18,033
YOU WERE WARNED
THAT THIS IS THE FORUM FOR YOUR
TIKTOKRY.

112
00:06:18,033 --> 00:06:22,686
MR. SLIWA, WHY SHOULD NEW
YORKERS VOTE FOR YOU?

113
00:06:22,686 --> 00:06:25,356
>> IT'S SIMPLE.
I'M THE ONLY CANDIDATE HERE

114
00:06:25,356 --> 00:06:28,830
WHO'S BEEN DANGLED WE MY
TESTICLES OVER THE VERAZZANO BRIDGE

115
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:32,649
BY A LITTLE-KNOWN GANG
CALLED THE LORDS OF FLATBUSH.

116
00:06:32,649 --> 00:06:37,751
I WAS ALSO POURED INTO THE
FOUNDATION OF GIANTS STADIUM AND
CRAWLED MY WAY OUT.

117
00:06:37,751 --> 00:06:40,639
JUST ON MY WAY HERE, I WAS
EJACULATED UPON

118
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:45,353
DINER
SPIDER

119
00:06:46,508 --> 00:06:50,515
JUST ON YOUR WAY HERE?

120
00:06:50,515 --> 00:06:52,226
ALL RIGHT, LET'S MOVE ON.

121
00:06:52,226 --> 00:06:56,104
FROM CONGESTION PRICING TO
HOMELESSNESS TO I.C.E. RAIDS,

122
00:06:56,104 --> 00:06:58,432
THERE ARE MANY ISSUES FACING OUR
CITY.

123
00:06:58,432 --> 00:07:02,289
WHAT DO YOU THINK IS THE BIGGEST
PROBLEM YOU HAVE TO CONFRONT AS
MAYOR?

124
00:07:02,289 --> 00:07:04,664
>> IT'S ME!

125
00:07:04,664 --> 00:07:09,138
YES.
THEY CAN PRETEND THIS ELECTION
IS ABOUT HOUSING AND TAXES,

126
00:07:09,138 --> 00:07:11,089
BUT
WE ALL KNOW IT'S ABOUT ME,
RIGHT?

127
00:07:11,089 --> 00:07:14,350
BECAUSE I'M GOING TO BE VERY
INVOLVED, VERY HANDS-ON.

128
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:17,465
THIS GUY KNOWS ABOUT HANDS ON,
RIGHT, CUOMO?

129
00:07:17,465 --> 00:07:19,310
>> HEY-YO, YOU GOT ME.

130
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:22,612
>> LOOK AT THESE CANDIDATES WE
GOT.
LOOK AT CURTIS SLIWA.

131
00:07:22,612 --> 00:07:24,515
I LOVE HIM, BUT WE'VE GOT TO DO
SOMETHING

132
00:07:24,515 --> 00:07:27,312
ABOUT THAT "EMILY IN
PARIS" LOOKING HAT, RIGHT?

133
00:07:27,312 --> 00:07:29,672
HE'S MY "RUSHMORE" MAX!

134
00:07:29,672 --> 00:07:35,171
AND THE FRONT-RUNNER ZORA
MAMDANI.

135
00:07:35,172 --> 00:07:39,942
MCKENZEY

136
00:07:39,942 --> 00:07:42,596
HE'S TOO YOUNG TO LEAD, FOLKS,
HE'S TOO YOUNG.

137
00:07:42,596 --> 00:07:44,699
HE DOESN'T HAVE THE WOBBLY WALK.

138
00:07:44,805 --> 00:07:48,396
OR FRANKLY THE MIND I HAVE.
GOOD BRAIN.

139
00:07:48,396 --> 00:07:53,059
I TOOK A COGNITIVE TEST.
I DID SO WELL ON MY COGNITIVE TEST

140
00:07:53,059 --> 00:07:56,321
THAT THEY IMMEDIATELY GAVE
ME AN MRI.

141
00:07:56,321 --> 00:07:59,545
THEY SAID THEY'D NEVER SEEN
ANYTHING LIKE IT.

142
00:07:59,545 --> 00:08:04,113
BUT IN TERMS OF ELECTION, I'D
LIKE TO GO BACK TO THAT VERY
IMPORTANT QUESTION.

143
00:08:04,113 --> 00:08:09,068
THE BAGEL.
MY GO-TO BAGEL ORDER IS BIG MAC
WITH A HOLE IN THE MIDDLE.

144
00:08:09,068 --> 00:08:13,559
AND I MAY NOT LIVE IN NEW YORK
ANYMORE, AWW!

145
00:08:14,646 --> 00:08:18,822
BUT I'M ALWAYS WATCHING.
LURKING IN THE SHADOWS.

146
00:08:18,822 --> 00:08:22,634
MUCH LIKE THE LATE, GREAT
PHANTOM OF THE OPERA.

147
00:08:22,634 --> 00:08:24,927
TERRIBLE, WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM
IN TERMS OF OPERA

148
00:08:24,927 --> 00:08:28,848
AND WITH
REGARD TO BEING BURNED BY
CHANDELIER.

149
00:08:28,848 --> 00:08:34,239
PERHAPS I'LL ADD "NEW YORK
MAYOR" TO MY LIST OF DUTIES.

150
00:08:34,239 --> 00:08:35,399
COME ON.

151
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:37,674
¶ OPEN UP YOUR MIND

152
00:08:37,674 --> 00:08:41,058
LET YOUR FANTASIES UNWIND ¶

153
00:08:41,058 --> 00:08:44,128
¶ IN THIS DARKNESS WHICH YOU KNOW

154
00:08:44,128 --> 00:08:47,728
YOU CANNOT FIND ¶

155
00:08:47,728 --> 00:08:49,862
¶ THE DARKNESS OF

156
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:55,633
THE MUSIC OF THE NIGHT ¶

157
00:08:55,633 --> 00:09:00,410
AND LIVE FROM NEW YORK, IT'S
SATURDAY NIGHT!

158
00:11:02,785 --> 00:11:08,206
MUSICAL

159
00:11:08,206 --> 00:11:12,506
HOST

160
00:11:14,905 --> 00:11:20,482
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN -- MILES
TELLER!

161
00:11:37,707 --> 00:11:40,583
>> THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK
YOU VERY MUCH.

162
00:11:40,583 --> 00:11:44,019
I AM SO HAPPY TO BE BACK HOSTING
SNL.

163
00:11:44,019 --> 00:11:45,420
THE LAST TIME --

164
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:48,163
THANK YOU.

165
00:11:48,163 --> 00:11:50,841
THE LAST TIME I HOSTED WAS IN
2022.

166
00:11:50,841 --> 00:11:54,721
IT MEANS A LOT TO BE HERE FOR
ME, ESPECIALLY ON HALLOWEEN
WEEKEND.

167
00:11:54,721 --> 00:11:58,932
YEAH, BECAUSE WHEN I WAS A KID,
ME AND MY SISTERS

168
00:11:58,932 --> 00:12:01,940
USED TO GO
TRICK-OR-TREATING AS "SNL"
CHARACTERS.

169
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:04,657
SO I DON'T KNOW IF YOU REMEMBER
THE NIGHT OF THE ROCKSBURY GUYS.

170
00:12:04,657 --> 00:12:07,833
THEY'RE THE BEST.
WILL FERRELL, CHRIS McCANN.

171
00:12:10,618 --> 00:12:14,424
WHERE ARE THEY?
THERE THEY ARE.

172
00:12:15,204 --> 00:12:17,718
WE WENT AS THEM ONE YEAR,

173
00:12:17,718 --> 00:12:21,306
AND HERE'S A PHOTO OF ME AND MY
SISTERS.

174
00:12:26,307 --> 00:12:31,547
I MEAN, HONESTLY, I'M JUST NOW
REALIZING HOW FAR OFF WE WERE
WITH THAT LOOK.

175
00:12:31,547 --> 00:12:34,689
IT'S LIKE WE JUST LOOK LIKE
LITTLE GREEK MEN.

176
00:12:34,689 --> 00:12:37,090
IT MUST HAVE BEEN SO CONFUSING,

177
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:39,961
ME AND MY SISTERS GOING UP TO
DOORS JUST LIKE --

178
00:12:46,881 --> 00:12:50,140
BUT GROWING UP, I MOVED AROUND A
LOT.

179
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:54,797
SO "SNL" HAS ALWAYS BEEN ONE OF
THE MORE CONSISTENT PARTS OF MY
LIFE.

180
00:12:54,797 --> 00:12:59,492
I LIVED IN PENNSYLVANIA,
GEORGIA, DELAWARE, JERSEY, AND
FLORIDA.

181
00:12:59,492 --> 00:13:01,016
ALL BEFORE I WAS 12.

182
00:13:01,016 --> 00:13:04,309
SO HONESTLY, IT GETS A BIT
CONFUSING

183
00:13:04,309 --> 00:13:06,783
WHEN PEOPLE ASK ME
WHERE I'M FROM.

184
00:13:06,783 --> 00:13:09,829
I'M LIKE, I DON'T KNOW, MAN,
TOP GUN 2?

185
00:13:09,829 --> 00:13:12,353
WHERE ARE YOU FROM?

186
00:13:12,353 --> 00:13:14,717
BUT THAT'S WHY I LOVE COMING
HERE.

187
00:13:14,717 --> 00:13:16,763
BECAUSE I HAVE A LOT OF
MEMORIES.

188
00:13:16,763 --> 00:13:20,410
LIKE RIGHT THERE.
THAT'S WHERE I HAD MY FIRST
BEER.

189
00:13:20,476 --> 00:13:24,080
NOT EVER.
JUST LIKE TODAY.

190
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:27,740
AND OVER THERE.
OH, THAT'S WHERE I ALMOST FELL
GETTING OUT OF MY COSTUME.

191
00:13:27,855 --> 00:13:30,421
AND RIGHT THERE, THAT'S WHERE BOWEN SAID,

192
00:13:30,421 --> 00:13:33,835
"MILES, YOU PROBABLY
FELL BECAUSE YOU HAD SO MANY
BEERS."

193
00:13:33,835 --> 00:13:35,538
I JUST LOVE MEMORIES.

194
00:13:35,538 --> 00:13:37,769
REALLY NICE JUST TO REFLECT.

195
00:13:37,769 --> 00:13:41,683
BUT HONESTLY, GUYS, I'M SO HAPPY
TO BE HERE WITH ALL OF YOU.

196
00:13:41,683 --> 00:13:44,494
A LOT HAS HAPPENED SINCE THE
LAST TIME THAT I HOSTED.

197
00:13:44,494 --> 00:13:48,197
A FEW MONTHS AGO, MY WIFE AND I
LOST OUR HOUSE IN THE PALISADES
FIRE.

198
00:13:48,197 --> 00:13:50,500
BUT DON'T WORRY.
SERIOUSLY, DO NOT WORRY.

199
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:53,095
WE'RE DOING GREAT.
I SEE YOU UP THERE, BABY.

200
00:13:53,095 --> 00:13:56,354
BUT THAT EXPERIENCE HAS MADE ME
INCREDIBLY GRATEFUL

201
00:13:56,354 --> 00:13:59,235
TO HAVE SO
MANY PLACES THAT I CAN CALL
HOME.

202
00:13:59,235 --> 00:14:03,213
BUT BASED ON WHAT HAPPENED TO
THE LAST PLACE THAT I CALLED HOME,

203
00:14:03,213 --> 00:14:05,033
I JUST WANT TO SAY --

204
00:14:05,033 --> 00:14:08,254
THERE'S FIRE EXITS LOCATED
THERE, THERE, THERE.

205
00:14:08,254 --> 00:14:09,616
WE GOT TWO IN THE BACK.

206
00:14:09,616 --> 00:14:11,798
THANK YOU, GUYS.
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A GREAT
SHOW.

207
00:14:11,798 --> 00:14:13,417
BRANDI

208
00:14:13,417 --> 00:14:16,309
STICK

209
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:38,449
>>> IT'S "WHAT DID I DO LAST
NIGHT?"

210
00:14:38,449 --> 00:14:41,098
AND HERE'S YOUR HOST.

211
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:47,159
>> HELLO.
HELLO, HELLO, HELLO.

212
00:14:47,159 --> 00:14:49,178
I AM YOUR HOST, GAY FOPAY.

213
00:14:49,178 --> 00:14:54,627
AND WELCOME BACK TO "WHAT DID I
DO LAST NIGHT?"

214
00:14:54,627 --> 00:14:57,799
THE ONLY GAME SHOW WHERE THREE
DEEPLY HUNGOVER CONTESTANTS

215
00:14:57,799 --> 00:15:01,101
HAVE
TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THEY GOT UP
TO THE NIGHT BEFORE.

216
00:15:01,101 --> 00:15:05,716
AND OF COURSE, TODAY IS OUR
EXTRA-PAINFUL DAY AFTER
HALLOWEEN EDITION.

217
00:15:05,716 --> 00:15:07,845
LET'S MEET OUR PLAYERS.

218
00:15:08,668 --> 00:15:12,004
>> OH, GOD, TURN IT DOWN.

219
00:15:12,004 --> 00:15:15,370
>> FIRST UP WE'VE GOT KENNETH
FROM NEW JERSEY.

220
00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:18,659
HELLO, KENNETH.
OH, MAN, STINKS OVER HERE.

221
00:15:18,659 --> 00:15:22,346
>> YEAH, I CLAWED THE CASTLE
LAST NIGHT.
>> WHAT'S THAT?

222
00:15:22,346 --> 00:15:26,177
>> WHEN YOU DRANK 14 WHITE CLAWS
AND EAT WHITE CASTLE.

223
00:15:26,177 --> 00:15:28,648
>> YOU GOT A DEATH WISH,
BROTHER.

224
00:15:28,648 --> 00:15:32,148
NEXT WE HAVE ELIZABETH FROM NEW
MEXICO.

225
00:15:32,148 --> 00:15:35,020
WHAT WAS YOUR COSTUME?
>> SEXY CAT.

226
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:37,861
>> I'M SURE IT STARTED THAT WAY.

227
00:15:37,861 --> 00:15:41,638
IF YOU WERE AT THE SHELTER,
YOU'D BE PUT DOWN, GIRL.

228
00:15:41,638 --> 00:15:45,911
AND YOUR NAME IS RONDELL FROM
WHERE?

229
00:15:45,911 --> 00:15:48,857
>> RON FROM DELAWARE.

230
00:15:48,857 --> 00:15:52,575
I WAS SHAKING WHEN I WROTE THAT.
>> YEAH, OKAY.

231
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:54,752
LOUIS, TELL THEM WHAT THEY'RE
PLAYING FOR.

232
00:15:54,752 --> 00:15:56,696
>> TODAY'S GRAND PRIZE IS

233
00:15:56,696 --> 00:15:59,603
A LARGE PEDIALYTE AND A BACON, EGG
AND CHEESE.

234
00:15:59,603 --> 00:16:02,638
>> MY GOD.
>> I NEED THAT.

235
00:16:02,638 --> 00:16:05,361
>> I NEED THAT NOW.
I NEED THAT.

236
00:16:05,361 --> 00:16:07,625
>> WELL, YOU CAN HAVE IT IF YOU
WIN.

237
00:16:07,625 --> 00:16:11,855
KENNETH, YOU'RE UP FIRST.
WHAT WAS YOUR UBER FAUX PAS?

238
00:16:11,855 --> 00:16:15,201
WAS IT "A," A LITTLE PUKE?

239
00:16:15,201 --> 00:16:20,116
B, MAJOR MADE YOUR DRIVER GO
THROUGH THE DRIVE-THRU AND PAY
FOR YOUR FOOD?

240
00:16:20,116 --> 00:16:25,037
OR "C," ASKED FOR THE AUX THEN
WATCHED PORN?

241
00:16:26,722 --> 00:16:30,768
>> KNOWING MYSELF, I'D SAY I
PUKED IN THE UBER.

242
00:16:30,768 --> 00:16:34,511
>> OH, SO CLOSE.
THAT WAS ACTUALLY A TRICK
QUESTION.

243
00:16:34,511 --> 00:16:37,268
YOU DID PUKE, BUT IT WASN'T IN
AN UBER.

244
00:16:37,268 --> 00:16:41,164
YOU JUST SAW A GUY IN A CAMRY,
AND YOU GOT IN.

245
00:16:41,164 --> 00:16:44,619
>> IN MY DEFENSE, I DO THAT A
LOT.

246
00:16:44,619 --> 00:16:47,369
>> DOESN'T MATTER.
YOUR PENALTY IS --

247
00:16:47,369 --> 00:16:50,390
LISTENING TO
MY NEPHEW, ANDRE, LEARN THE SAX.

248
00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:51,808
>> NO.

249
00:16:53,083 --> 00:16:57,169
>> STOP!
>> NO, NO!

250
00:16:59,202 --> 00:17:02,610
>> ALL RIGHT.
NEXT UP, ELIZABETH.

251
00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:06,695
YOUR QUESTION IS, WHO DID YOU
BITE, AND WHERE DID YOU BITE
THEM?

252
00:17:06,695 --> 00:17:09,795
>> I BIT SOMEONE?
>> YOU MOST CERTAINLY DID.

253
00:17:09,795 --> 00:17:13,985
AND YOUR CHOICES ARE, "A," YOUR
FRIEND JENNA IN THE NECK.

254
00:17:13,985 --> 00:17:17,038
B, YOURSELF ON THE TONGUE.

255
00:17:17,038 --> 00:17:20,906
OR "C," THE BOUNCER ON THE
NIPPLE.

256
00:17:20,906 --> 00:17:25,835
>> OH, OH -- MY TONGUE HURTS
TODAY, SO I'M THINKING "B,"
MYSELF.

257
00:17:25,835 --> 00:17:29,727
>> NO.
THE ANSWER WAS, ALL OF THE
ABOVE.

258
00:17:29,727 --> 00:17:34,953
AND YOUR PERSONALITY IS,
CATCHING UP WITH AN ACQUAINTANCE
FROM HIGH SCHOOL.

259
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:40,658
>> HEY, I'M SURE YOU HEARD, BUT
THINGS HAVEN'T BEEN GOING GREAT
FOR ME.

260
00:17:40,658 --> 00:17:43,326
THANKS FOR AGREEING TO HELP ME
MOVE.

261
00:17:43,326 --> 00:17:46,054
>> NOOOOO!

262
00:17:46,054 --> 00:17:49,417
>> ALL RIGHT, NOW RON, YOUR
QUESTION INCLUDES A VIDEO CLUE.

263
00:17:49,417 --> 00:17:52,527
THIS IS SECURITY FOOTAGE OF YOU
AT THE ATM LAST NIGHT.

264
00:17:52,527 --> 00:17:53,698
>> OH GOD.

265
00:17:53,698 --> 00:17:55,790
>> LOUIS, LET'S ROLL THE TAPE.

266
00:17:55,790 --> 00:17:59,418
>> THE MONEY MACHINE, THE MONEY
MACHINE.

267
00:17:59,418 --> 00:18:02,406
CAN'T YOU GET MONEY FOR FREE?

268
00:18:02,406 --> 00:18:04,647
DRY HEAVING

269
00:18:05,047 --> 00:18:07,136
BATHROOM

270
00:18:07,136 --> 00:18:08,972
OH, LOOK AT HIM GO!

271
00:18:09,261 --> 00:18:12,738
>> HELLO!
I NEED $400.

272
00:18:14,257 --> 00:18:18,821
>> OH A LITTLE CAMEO FROM
ELIZABETH AS SHE BIT YOU.

273
00:18:18,821 --> 00:18:21,210
SORRY, A LOT OF TROUBLE THERE.

274
00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:23,706
>> WHAT'S YOUR QUESTION, MAN?

275
00:18:23,706 --> 00:18:25,719
>> NO QUESTION.

276
00:18:25,719 --> 00:18:28,114
I JUST WANTED TO MAKE YOU WATCH
THAT CLIP.

277
00:18:28,114 --> 00:18:31,639
BUT YOUR PRIZE FOR WATCHING IT
IS A CHAIR.

278
00:18:31,639 --> 00:18:33,299
WHY DON'T YOU TAKE A SEAT, RON?

279
00:18:33,299 --> 00:18:37,164
>> OH, THANK GOD.
OH, MY GOD, THAT'S HUGE.

280
00:18:37,164 --> 00:18:41,384
THIS CHANGES EVERYTHING.
OH, THAT'S SO HUGE.

281
00:18:42,937 --> 00:18:47,371
>> ALL RIGHT, KENNETH, FOR AN
OPPORTUNITY TO STEAL THE CHAIR --

282
00:18:47,371 --> 00:18:50,898
WHICH OF THESE
INDIVIDUALS GAVE YOU THAT BLACK
EYE?

283
00:18:50,898 --> 00:18:54,485
WAS IT "A," THIS OLDER WOMAN?

284
00:18:54,485 --> 00:18:57,642
B, THIS LITTLE BOY?

285
00:18:57,642 --> 00:19:01,046
OR "C," A STOP SIGN?

286
00:19:02,873 --> 00:19:04,898
>> UH -- I MEAN, NONE OF THEM
ARE GOOD.

287
00:19:04,898 --> 00:19:08,205
BUT -- I GUESS I'LL SAY THE
LADY.

288
00:19:08,205 --> 00:19:10,948
>> NO.
THE LITTLE BOY.

289
00:19:10,948 --> 00:19:13,034
YOU STOLE HIS COSTUME.

290
00:19:13,034 --> 00:19:17,175
>> I WAS WONDERING WHY I WAS
DRESSED AS A CORN.
OKAY.

291
00:19:17,175 --> 00:19:18,946
>> ALL RIGHT.

292
00:19:20,523 --> 00:19:24,255
LAST UP IS ELIZABETH FOR A
CHANCE AT THE GRAND PRIZE.

293
00:19:24,255 --> 00:19:26,755
THE BACON, EGG AND CHEESE

294
00:19:26,755 --> 00:19:29,258
AND THE PEDIALYTE.

295
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:32,822
>> WHO DID YOU MAKE OUT WITH
LAST NIGHT?

296
00:19:32,822 --> 00:19:35,541
SAME OPTIONS AS BEFORE.

297
00:19:36,207 --> 00:19:41,280
OLD LADY, LITTLE BOY, STOP SIGN.

298
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,507
>> I WOKE UP WITH A CHIPPED
TOOTH.
GOT TO BE THE STOP SIGN.

299
00:19:44,507 --> 00:19:48,373
>> THAT IS RIGHT, YOU TRASH CAT,
GET OVER HERE.

300
00:19:48,674 --> 00:19:51,049
OH, WELL, THAT'S OUR TIME FOR
TODAY.

301
00:19:51,049 --> 00:19:54,383
I AM GAY FOPAY.
THANKS FOR WATCHING.

302
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:05,581
>>> THIS WEEK ON A VERY SPECIAL
EPISODE OF "PROPERTY BROTHERS."

303
00:20:05,581 --> 00:20:08,101
>> I'M DREW SCOTT, AND I'M A
REAL ESTATE EXPERT.

304
00:20:08,101 --> 00:20:10,760
>> I'M HIS TWIN BROTHER
JONATHAN, AND I'M A CONTRACTOR.

305
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:13,161
THAT MEANS I FIND THE PERFECT
PROPERTY --

306
00:20:13,161 --> 00:20:16,322
>> AND I ACTUALLY HAVE TO
RENOVATE THE DARN THING.

307
00:20:16,681 --> 00:20:19,452
>> THIS WEEK, WE'RE TAKING ON
OUR BIGGEST CHALLENGE YET --

308
00:20:19,452 --> 00:20:22,688
>> BUILDING THE NEW WHITE HOUSE
BALLROOM.

309
00:20:22,688 --> 00:20:25,861
- HI. THE PROPERTY BROTHERS.
- NICE.

310
00:20:25,861 --> 00:20:30,294
SO WHICH ONE OF YOU MARRIED THE
NEW GIRL, AND WHICH ONE OF YOU'S
THE GAY?

311
00:20:30,294 --> 00:20:31,951
>> I MARRIED THE NEW GIRL.

312
00:20:31,951 --> 00:20:35,135
>> DONALD AND MELANIA MOVED INTO
THIS HOUSE NINE YEARS AGO.

313
00:20:35,135 --> 00:20:38,269
THEY WERE EVICTED FOR FOUR
YEARS, BUT THEY MOVED BACK IN.

314
00:20:38,269 --> 00:20:41,259
DONALD HAS A STRONG EYE FOR
INTERIOR DESIGN.

315
00:20:41,259 --> 00:20:44,208
>> I PUT THESE GOLD URNS
EVERYWHERE.

316
00:20:44,208 --> 00:20:45,989
LIKE A HUNDRED IN EVERY ROOM.

317
00:20:45,989 --> 00:20:49,630
THAT MAKES ME HAPPY.
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO BE HAPPY
THESE DAYS.

318
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:52,768
REALLY DARK STUFF HAPPENING IN
THE WORLD.
SOME OF IT ME.

319
00:20:52,768 --> 00:20:57,385
AND HERE'S A CROWN I JUST GOT
FROM MY TRIP TO ASIA.

320
00:20:57,385 --> 00:21:00,557
NOTHING SAYS DEMOCRACY LIKE A
CROWN, RIGHT?

321
00:21:00,557 --> 00:21:03,774
>> AND HIS WIFE, MELANIA, SHE'S
GOT A STYLE ALL HER OWN.

322
00:21:03,774 --> 00:21:06,402
>> I LOVE THIS HALLOWEEN
DECORATIONS YOU PUT UP.

323
00:21:06,402 --> 00:21:09,088
>> THAT'S FOR CHRISTMAS.

324
00:21:09,389 --> 00:21:13,192
>> THE TRUMPS HAVE ALREADY MADE
A FEW SUBTLE CHANGES TO THE
HOUSE.

325
00:21:13,193 --> 00:21:16,122
FDR

326
00:21:16,122 --> 00:21:20,422
AND PUT A PAINTING OF
HIMSELF AS A SOLDIER FROM
HALO.

327
00:21:20,423 --> 00:21:22,111
LEARNED

328
00:21:22,111 --> 00:21:24,871
YOU KNOW YOU CAN'T SAY MASTER
CHIEF ANYMORE.
RIGHT?

329
00:21:24,871 --> 00:21:26,611
YOU'VE GOT TO SAY PRIMARY CHIEF.

330
00:21:26,611 --> 00:21:29,738
>> THEY ALSO PAVED THE ROSE
GARDEN AND TURNED IT INTO WHAT LOOKS LIKE

331
00:21:29,738 --> 00:21:31,506
OUTDOOR SKATING AT AN
OLIVE GARDEN.

332
00:21:31,506 --> 00:21:34,636
DONALD AND MELANIA STILL FEEL
LIKE SOMETHING'S MISSING.

333
00:21:34,636 --> 00:21:37,754
>> THE HOUSE IS ONLY 55,000
SQUARE FEET.

334
00:21:37,754 --> 00:21:39,720
AND 132 ROOMS.

335
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:41,332
>> WE NEED MORE SPACE!

336
00:21:41,332 --> 00:21:43,784
RIGHT?
WE NEED MORE SPACE!

337
00:21:43,784 --> 00:21:47,457
>> WE NEED A BALLROOM BECAUSE
DONALD, HE LOVES TO DANCE.

338
00:21:47,457 --> 00:21:49,857
>> I'M A TERRIFIC DANCER.
TERRIFIC DANCER.

339
00:21:49,857 --> 00:21:52,712
JUST ASK YOUR EYES.

340
00:21:54,134 --> 00:21:56,215
>> WE ASKED DONALD WHAT HIS
BUDGET WAS,

341
00:21:56,215 --> 00:21:59,483
AND HE SAID BETWEEN
$350 MILLION AND INFINITY.

342
00:21:59,483 --> 00:22:01,541
THEN WE ASKED IF HE NEEDED A PERMIT,

343
00:22:01,541 --> 00:22:03,189
AND DONALD LAUGHED
REALLY HARD.

344
00:22:03,189 --> 00:22:07,728
HE SAID, I COULD BUILD THIS
BALLROOM WITH THE BONES OF MY ENEMIES,
AND NO ONE COULD STOP ME,

345
00:22:07,728 --> 00:22:10,279
AS OPPOSED TO A BONEHEAD
LIKE MY BROTHER.

346
00:22:10,279 --> 00:22:11,887
>> OH, YOU HUSH UP.

347
00:22:12,506 --> 00:22:16,630
>> WE SHOWED DONALD OUR PLAN FOR
A BALLROOM THAT WOULD MATCH THE
CURRENT PROPORTIONS,

348
00:22:16,630 --> 00:22:18,385
BUT HE KEPT
CLICKING "ENLARGE."

349
00:22:18,386 --> 00:22:20,584
FENCE
STREET

350
00:22:20,584 --> 00:22:21,720
>> THEY CAN DRIVE AROUND IT.

351
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:24,646
OH, I WANT A RING FOR MMA
FIGHTS.

352
00:22:24,646 --> 00:22:28,922
OFFICIAL ONES BUT ALSO CASUAL
FIGHTS IN THE BACKYARD, YOU KNOW
WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT?

353
00:22:28,922 --> 00:22:31,970
TWO MENTALLY ILL GUYS JUST
WHALING ON EACH OTHER.

354
00:22:31,970 --> 00:22:33,567
DO BUM FIGHTS AGAIN.

355
00:22:33,567 --> 00:22:36,287
REMEMBER BUM FIGHTS?
WE LOVE BUM FIGHTS!

356
00:22:36,287 --> 00:22:40,562
>> TO NAIL DOWN THE STYLE OF THE
BALLROOM, WE ASKED DONALD TO
COME UP WITH A BOARD.

357
00:22:40,562 --> 00:22:43,059
>> THIS KIND OF GUY AND THIS GUY --

358
00:22:43,059 --> 00:22:45,068
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE
MET HIM, BUT HE'S A GREAT GUY.

359
00:22:45,068 --> 00:22:47,914
THEN SOMETHING LIKE THIS COULD
ALSO BE NICE.

360
00:22:47,914 --> 00:22:50,274
>> I TOLD DONALD OUR NUMBER ONE PRIORITY

361
00:22:50,274 --> 00:22:52,740
WAS TO PRESERVE THE
HISTORIC NATURE OF THE BUILDING.

362
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:55,241
HE SENT ME BACK THIS GIF.

363
00:22:55,241 --> 00:22:59,334
WE DEMOLISHED THE ENTIRE EAST
WING IN TWO DAYS.

364
00:23:01,066 --> 00:23:04,733
WITH THE GOVERNMENT STILL SHUT
DOWN AND SO MANY WORKERS FURLOUGHED,

365
00:23:04,733 --> 00:23:08,772
WE WERE ABLE TO
FORCE PARK RANGERS AND
ASTRONAUTS TO DO A LOT OF THE
CHEM DEMOLITION.

366
00:23:08,772 --> 00:23:11,768
>> WERE YOU SAD TO LOSE THE
HISTORIC PRESIDENTIAL MOVIE
THEATER?

367
00:23:11,768 --> 00:23:14,589
BILL CLINTON CALLED IT THE BEST
PERK OF BEING PRESIDENT.

368
00:23:14,589 --> 00:23:15,884
>> BILL CLINTON SAID THAT?

369
00:23:15,884 --> 00:23:20,579
HE SAID THE BEST PERK FOR HIM
WAS THE MOVIE THEATER?

370
00:23:20,579 --> 00:23:23,654
>> UNFORTUNATELY THE RENOVATION
HIT A BIT OF A SNAG

371
00:23:23,654 --> 00:23:26,899
WHEN DONALD
REALIZED HE HAD DEPORTED ALL THE
CONSTRUCTION WORKERS

372
00:23:26,899 --> 00:23:29,844
I PULLED
INTO THE HOME DEPOT PARKING LOT
AND YELLED,

373
00:23:29,844 --> 00:23:31,775
"JUST GIVE ME THE
WHITES."

374
00:23:31,775 --> 00:23:35,053
I WANT THE DAY LABORERS FROM
NORWAY AND SWEDEN,

375
00:23:35,053 --> 00:23:37,344
BUT
APPARENTLY THEY DON'T EXIST.

376
00:23:37,344 --> 00:23:39,921
>> BUT IN THE END, WE'RE
CONFIDENT THE NEW BALLROOM

377
00:23:39,921 --> 00:23:43,019
WILL BE A SHINING BEACON OF FREEDOM
FOR ALL AMERICANS.

378
00:23:43,019 --> 00:23:45,891
>> AND IT WILL BE READY JUST IN
TIME FOR MY THIRD TERM.

379
00:23:45,891 --> 00:23:49,117
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
WE WANT THIS TO BE OUR FOREVER
HOME.

380
00:23:49,117 --> 00:23:50,588
>> YES, BECAUSE WE'RE NOT
LEAVING.

381
00:23:50,588 --> 00:23:52,590
WE'RE GOING TO BE DOING
SOMETHING CALLED COUP.

382
00:23:52,590 --> 00:23:55,884
>> AND WE'LL MAKE SURE THAT
TRUMP'S DREAM BECOMES A REALITY.

383
00:23:55,884 --> 00:23:58,535
IF MY DUMB BROTHER DOESN'T SCREW
IT UP.

384
00:23:58,535 --> 00:24:01,211
>> SERIOUSLY?
[ BLEEP ] YOU.

385
00:24:02,728 --> 00:24:04,924
>> THANK YOU SO MUCH.

386
00:24:04,924 --> 00:24:07,534
>> OKAY, I GUESS THE ONLY THING
LEFT IS THE PAYMENT FOR THE
CONSTRUCTION.

387
00:24:07,534 --> 00:24:10,466
>> AREN'T YOU GUYS FROM CANADA?
>> YEAH.

388
00:24:10,466 --> 00:24:12,368
>> I.C.E.!

389
00:24:12,368 --> 00:24:15,193
THERE GOES I.C.E.
WE LIKE THEM.
BIG AT I.C.E.

390
00:24:15,193 --> 00:24:16,909
>> SPOOKY.
>> VERY SPOOKY.

391
00:24:16,909 --> 00:24:18,903
IT'S A VERY SPOOKY SECRET
POLICE THING.

392
00:24:18,903 --> 00:24:23,426
>> "PROPERTY BROTHERS."
ONLY ON HGTV AND TRUTH SOCIAL.

393
00:24:50,731 --> 00:24:54,320
>>> GENTLEMEN, THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR COMING IN TO DO THESE PROMOS

394
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:57,066
FOR THE NATIONAL HOCKEY LEAGUE'S
COMMUNITY OUTREACH DAY.

395
00:24:57,066 --> 00:25:00,234
>> WE'RE SO GLAD TO HAVE PLAYERS
FROM THE NEW YORK RANGERS,

396
00:25:00,234 --> 00:25:02,750
THE
L.A. KINGS, AND THE NASHVILLE
PREDATORS.

397
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:04,478
>> MY NAME IS DIDIER LEREW.

398
00:25:04,478 --> 00:25:06,325
>> I JUST GO BY MIDGE.

399
00:25:06,325 --> 00:25:11,162
>> YOU MAY KNOW US FROM SUCH
WORKS AS THE SECOND IT LAYING OF
THE J.G. WENTWORTH COMMERCIAL

400
00:25:11,162 --> 00:25:13,363
WHERE THEY SANG ON A BUS.

401
00:25:13,363 --> 00:25:17,033
>> ALL RIGHT.
JUST READ THE LINES, AND WE
SHOULD BE OUT OF HERE IN NO
TIME.

402
00:25:17,033 --> 00:25:19,033
>> ALL RIGHT, AND ACTION!

403
00:25:19,033 --> 00:25:22,754
>> THE NHL IS PROUD OF THE
CHARITY WORK WE DO IN OUR
COMMUNITIES.

404
00:25:22,754 --> 00:25:25,213
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
I MAY BE A KING ON THE ICE,

405
00:25:25,213 --> 00:25:27,504
BUT
I'M ALSO A KING IN THE
COMMUNITY.

406
00:25:27,504 --> 00:25:29,631
>> AND I'M A RANGER IN MY
COMMUNITY.

407
00:25:29,631 --> 00:25:32,156
>> AND I'M A PREDATOR IN MY
COMMUNITY.

408
00:25:32,156 --> 00:25:35,933
WHEN YOU SEE THIS FACE, JUST
KNOW A PREDATOR IS IN THE
COMMUNITY.

409
00:25:35,933 --> 00:25:38,152
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
CAN WE CUT?

410
00:25:38,152 --> 00:25:40,762
>> CUT!
WHAT'S THE ISSUE, MAN?

411
00:25:40,762 --> 00:25:44,322
>> I MEAN, DO I HAVE TO SAY THAT
I'M A PREDATOR IN IN MY
COMMUNITY?

412
00:25:44,322 --> 00:25:47,467
>> WHY NOT?
YOU PLAY FOR THE NASHVILLE
PREDATORS.

413
00:25:47,467 --> 00:25:50,751
>> YEAH, BUT YOU HEAR HOW IT
SOUNDS, RIGHT?

414
00:25:50,751 --> 00:25:55,374
>> OKAY, SO IT'S GOING TO BE ONE
OF THOSE SHOOTS.

415
00:25:55,374 --> 00:25:56,992
DIVA ALERT!

416
00:25:56,992 --> 00:25:58,920
>> MAN.

DID YOU GET AN AVAIL CHECK FOR A
JUSTIN LONG CHOBANI COMMERCIAL?

420
00:26:08,818 --> 00:26:11,687
>> I DON'T KNOW WHAT ANY OF THAT
MEANS.

421
00:26:11,687 --> 00:26:13,629
>> YEAH, I DIDN'T THINK SO.

422

DO YOUR JOB AND I'LL DO MY
OPINION, BUD.

>> WHAT IS THE MEANING OF ALL OF
THIS UNPROFESSIONALISM?

429
00:26:37,296 --> 00:26:41,499
>> I MAKE SICK KIDS FEEL
TOUCHED?
I DON'T WANT TO SAY THAT.

430
00:26:41,499 --> 00:26:44,669
>> ARE YOU KIDDING ME, PAL?
DO YOU KNOW WHO YOU'RE TALKING
TO?

NEW YORK RANGERS ARE SPONSORING
LITERACY WORK IN INDIA.

I'M VISITING THAILAND TO
HOPEFULLY RUB OFF ON SOME KIDS

444
00:27:25,564 --> 00:27:29,705
SO MAYBE ONE DAY THEY BECOME
PREDATORS JUST LIKE ME.

445
00:27:31,071 --> 00:27:33,226
I'M NOT -- I CAN'T SAY THESE
LINES.

446
00:27:33,226 --> 00:27:36,809

HAVE TO SAY ANYTHING.
YOU CAN KEEP THAT PRETTY LITTLE
MOUTH SHUT.

450
00:27:47,407 --> 00:27:51,350
AND THAT'S ON MIDGE.
>> OKAY, FINE.

HIGH ALERT

511

VIEWERS TO GET A LITTLE PEEK

595

00:42:07,042 --> 00:42:08,241
THEN AGAIN THIS YEAR, HE DID IT

773
00:42:08,243 --> 00:42:09,242
TO A KID DRESSED AS DJ

774
00:42:09,244 --> 00:42:17,817
MARSHMALLOW.

775
00:42:18,219 --> 00:42:20,954
JUST PUT IT IN THE BAG.

776
00:42:20,956 --> 00:42:21,854
WHY IS HE SO WEIRD?

777
00:42:21,856 --> 00:42:24,057
EVEN THE KID IS LIKE, THIS IS

778
00:42:24,059 --> 00:42:25,391
NOT RIGHT.

779
00:42:25,794 --> 00:42:27,493
IT'S KIND OF AN EMBODIMENT OF

780
00:42:27,495 --> 00:42:28,761
HIS SPIRE PRESIDENCY, BECAUSE

781
00:42:28,763 --> 00:42:30,496
IT'S JUST A VIOLATION OF NORMS

782
00:42:30,498 --> 00:42:32,532
THAT NO OTHER PRESIDENT OR

783
00:42:32,534 --> 00:42:34,534
PERSON HAS EVER CONCEIVED OF.

784
00:42:34,536 --> 00:42:35,468
LIKE, WHO'S EVER THOUGHT, I

785
00:42:35,470 --> 00:42:36,135
SHOULD PUT THE CANDY ON THE

786
00:42:36,137 --> 00:42:36,536
KID'S HEAD.

787
00:42:38,573 --> 00:42:39,806
MY FAVORE PART, THOUGH, IS

788
00:42:39,808 --> 00:42:41,307
WHEN TRUMP AND MELANIA MADE A

789
00:42:41,309 --> 00:42:43,142
GRAND ENTRANCE TO THIS SONG.

790
00:42:43,144 --> 00:42:54,754
¶¶

791
00:42:54,756 --> 00:42:56,155
>> MICHAEL JACKSON'S "THRILLER."

792
00:42:56,157 --> 00:42:58,024
JUST THE PERFECT SOUNDTRACK TO

793
00:42:58,026 --> 00:42:58,725
LURE KIDS TO A FAMOUS MANSION.

794
00:43:04,933 --> 00:43:07,300
>>> DUE TO THE GOVERNMENT

795
00:43:07,302 --> 00:43:12,505
SHUTDOWN, S.N.A.P. BENEFITS RAN

796
00:43:12,507 --> 00:43:14,841
OUT OF FUNDS TODAY.

797
00:43:14,843 --> 00:43:16,209
BUT THE GOVERNMENT STILL

798
00:43:16,211 --> 00:43:17,977
PROVIDES FREE FOOD TO FAMILIES

799
00:43:17,979 --> 00:43:20,947
THROUGH THE SECOND AMENDMENT.

800
00:43:21,750 --> 00:43:23,282
JAPAN'S NEW PRIME MINISTER SANAE

801
00:43:23,284 --> 00:43:24,817
TAKAICHI SAID DURING A PRESS

802
00:43:24,819 --> 00:43:25,785
CONFERENCE SHE'S NOMINATING

803
00:43:25,787 --> 00:43:26,819
PRESIDENT TRUMP FOR THE NOBEL

804
00:43:26,821 --> 00:43:27,353
PEACE PRIZE.

805
00:43:27,355 --> 00:43:28,788
AND I CAN'T BELIEVE I GET TO SAY

806
00:43:28,790 --> 00:43:30,223
THIS, BUT THANK GOD NOBODY

807
00:43:30,225 --> 00:43:32,925
LISTENS TO WOMEN.

808
00:43:39,067 --> 00:43:40,500
>>> PRESIDENT TRUMP MET WITH

809
00:43:40,502 --> 00:43:41,367
CHINESE PRESIDENT XI JINPING.

810
00:43:41,369 --> 00:43:42,869
WHEN ASKED HOW THE MEETING WENT,

811
00:43:42,871 --> 00:43:43,503
TRUMP SAID THIS.

812
00:43:43,505 --> 00:43:45,471
>> BUT OVERALL, I GUESS ON THE

813
00:43:45,473 --> 00:43:47,540
SCALE FROM 0 TO 10 WITH 10 BEING

814
00:43:47,542 --> 00:43:48,007
THE PEST?

815
00:43:48,009 --> 00:43:48,708
I WOULD SAY THE MEETING WAS A

816
00:43:48,710 --> 00:43:49,275
12.

817
00:43:52,647 --> 00:43:54,080
>> I GUESS TRUMP JUST WANTED TO

818
00:43:54,082 --> 00:43:55,314
SHOW CHINA WE'RE STILL WAY WORSE

819
00:43:55,316 --> 00:43:55,648
AT MATH.

820
00:44:00,422 --> 00:44:02,055
TRUMP ALSO VISITED SOUTH KOREA

821
00:44:02,057 --> 00:44:04,290
AND WAS GIVEN A GOLD CROWN AND

822
00:44:04,292 --> 00:44:06,225
SERVED BEEF PATTIES WITH KETCHUP

823
00:44:06,227 --> 00:44:07,060
FOR DINNER.

824
00:44:07,062 --> 00:44:08,127
SO THEY BASICALLY GOT THE

825
00:44:08,129 --> 00:44:09,395
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES A

826
00:44:09,397 --> 00:44:09,962
HAPPY MEAL WITH A TOY.

827
00:44:13,635 --> 00:44:15,401
>>> CRITICS OF PRESIDENT TRUMP

828
00:44:15,403 --> 00:44:17,036
ARE CALLING HIM TONE DEAF FOR

829
00:44:17,038 --> 00:44:19,205
POSTING PICTURES OF HIS NEWLY

830
00:44:19,207 --> 00:44:20,173
RENOVATED WHITE HOUSE BATHROOM

831
00:44:20,175 --> 00:44:22,075
DURING THE GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN.

832
00:44:22,077 --> 00:44:23,443
BUT I'M HAPPY THAT THE FLOOR

833
00:44:23,445 --> 00:44:23,910
LOOKS SLIPPERY.

834
00:44:31,119 --> 00:44:34,253
>>> THE STATE OF TEXAS IS SUING

835
00:44:34,255 --> 00:44:35,321
TYLENOL, CLAIMING THAT IT IS

836
00:44:35,323 --> 00:44:36,289
LINKED TO AUTISM.

837
00:44:36,291 --> 00:44:37,657
OR AS IT'S CALLED IN TEXAS, BOY

838
00:44:37,659 --> 00:44:38,057
AIN'T RIGHT.

839
00:44:44,232 --> 00:44:46,699
>>> CUT ADVERTISE SLIWA,

GIULIANI.

845
00:44:55,543 --> 00:44:56,576
GIULIANI ONLY LIKES HIM BECAUSE

846
00:44:56,578 --> 00:44:57,343
HIS POLL NUMBERS ARE BETWEEN 9

847
00:44:57,345 --> 00:45:00,313

COMMUTED YOUR PRISON SENTENCE.

>> WELL, YEAH, PRISON WAS CRAZY.

871
00:45:46,795 --> 00:45:48,361
I WAS IN A ROOM BY MYSELF

872
00:45:48,363 --> 00:45:50,763
TALKING TO PEOPLE THROUGH A

873

WALL, GOING ON EIGHT DATES A

874

00:46:01,142 --> 00:46:02,542
PRISON CHANGED ME, COLIN.

I LOST A TON OF WEIGHT.

PRISON.

LIKE MINIMUM SECURITY?

910
00:46:44,886 --> 00:46:45,384
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

911
00:46:45,386 --> 00:46:47,987
I WAS IN JAIL WITH OTHER

912
00:46:47,989 --> 00:46:48,988
WHITE-COLLAR CRIMINALS, EVEN

REMEMBER HER?

921
00:47:01,469 --> 00:47:01,868
