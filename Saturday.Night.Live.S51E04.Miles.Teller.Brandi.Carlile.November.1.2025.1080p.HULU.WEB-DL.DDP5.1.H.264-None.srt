1
00:00:00,162 --> 00:00:04,298
>>> YOU'RE WATCHING NEW YORK 1,
NEW YORK'S NUMBER FIVE NEWS
STATION.

2
00:00:09,481 --> 00:00:11,712
>> HELLO.

3
00:00:12,611 --> 00:00:15,282
HELLO AND GOOD EVENING FROM NEW
YORK 1.

4
00:00:15,282 --> 00:00:16,454
YAMMER ROLL LOUIS,

5
00:00:16,454 --> 00:00:21,146
AND I AM NOW OFFICIALLY THE LEAST FAMOUS
PERSON TO BE IMPERSONATED ON
SNL.

6
00:00:21,146 --> 00:00:24,563
BUT TRUST ME, IT'S UNCANNY.

7
00:00:24,563 --> 00:00:28,163
WE'RE COMING TO YOU LIVE FOR
THIS THE THIRD, FINAL,

8
00:00:28,163 --> 00:00:31,378
AND
FICTIONAL NEW YORK CITY MAYORAL
DEBATE.

9
00:00:31,378 --> 00:00:35,493
TONIGHT'S EVENT IS SPONSORED BY
GRISTINI'S SUPERMARKET.

10
00:00:35,493 --> 00:00:38,544
SAY, WHERE DID YOU GET THAT WET
SANDWICH?

11
00:00:38,544 --> 00:00:40,715
WHY, GRISTITI'S, OF COURSE.

12
00:00:40,715 --> 00:00:42,709
AND BIKE LANES.

13
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:44,935
YOU WANT A NEW WAY TO DIE?

14
00:00:45,247 --> 00:00:47,912
STEP INTO A BIKE LANE.

15
00:00:47,912 --> 00:00:50,885
TONIGHT, WE'RE GOING TO HEAR
FROM TWO VIABLE CANDIDATES

16
00:00:50,885 --> 00:00:53,582
AND
ONE GOOD OLD-FASHIONED NEW YORK
NUT.

17
00:00:53,582 --> 00:00:58,210
FIRST UP, FORMER NEW YORK
GOVERNOR ANDREW CUOMO.

18
00:01:00,526 --> 00:01:03,652
>> HELLO, VOTERS.
YOU ALL KNOW ME.

19
00:01:03,652 --> 00:01:05,402
I GOT US THROUGH COVID, AND THEN

20
00:01:05,402 --> 00:01:09,040
YADA YADA YADA, HONK HONK,
SQUEEZE SQUEEZE.

21
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,777
ANYWAY, I'M BACK.

22
00:01:10,777 --> 00:01:14,246
I'M A BORN AND BRED NEW YORKER.
I LOVE IT HERE.

23
00:01:14,246 --> 00:01:17,364
I KNOW THIS CITY LIKE THE BACK
OF A WOMAN'S BACK,

24
00:01:17,364 --> 00:01:19,543
MAMMA MIA!

25
00:01:20,238 --> 00:01:25,281
>> NEXT WE HAVE THE DEMOCRATIC
NOMINEE, ZOHRAN MAMDANI.

26
00:01:27,121 --> 00:01:30,169
>> HELLO, EVERYONE.
I'M HAPPY TO BE HERE.

27
00:01:30,169 --> 00:01:34,619
AND I'M READY TO SPEND THE NEXT
HOUR HEARING MY OPPONENTS
PRONOUNCE MY NAME

28
00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:37,818
IN WAYS YOU
COULDN'T BEGIN TO IMAGINE.

29
00:01:37,818 --> 00:01:40,647
AND I KNOW SOME OF YOU ARE OUT
THERE SCARED

30
00:01:40,647 --> 00:01:43,417
OF THE IDEA OF A
YOUNG SOCIAL LIST MUSLIM MAYOR,

31
00:01:43,417 --> 00:01:45,027
SO ALLOW ME TO PUT YOU AT EASE --

32
00:01:45,027 --> 00:01:47,626
BY SMILING AFTER EVERY ANSWER

33
00:01:47,626 --> 00:01:51,253
IN A WAY THAT PHYSICALLY
HURTS MY FACE.

34
00:01:54,873 --> 00:01:56,514
>> ALL RIGHT.

35
00:01:56,514 --> 00:01:59,674
AND NOW LET'S DO A FUN ONE.

36
00:02:00,059 --> 00:02:04,125
THE REPUBLICAN NOMINEE, CURTIS
SLIWA.

37
00:02:04,682 --> 00:02:08,896
YES.
MR. SLIWA, YOUR OPENING
STATEMENT?

38
00:02:08,896 --> 00:02:12,696
>> I'M THRILLED TO BE HERE AND
NOT GETTING SHOT IN THE BACK

39
00:02:12,696 --> 00:02:16,391
OF A YELLOW CAB FIVE TIMES
BY THE GOTTIS AND GAMBINOS,

40
00:02:16,391 --> 00:02:22,642
AS I WAS
FAMOUSLY IN 1992, 1993, AND '94.

41
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:25,216
BUT I'M THE RIGHT CHOICE TO BE
YOUR NEXT MAYOR.

42
00:02:25,216 --> 00:02:27,555
NO OFFENSE TO MR. OPPONENTS, MR. CUOMO,

43
00:02:27,555 --> 00:02:31,618
AND I BELIEVE I'M SAYING
THIS RIGHT, ZOLTAR RAMZOMBIE.

44
00:02:34,022 --> 00:02:36,525
>> THAT'S NOT EVEN CLOSE.

45
00:02:36,525 --> 00:02:39,960
>> ALL RIGHT, CANDIDATES, YOU'RE
ALL RUNNING TO BE MAYOR OF NEW
YORK CITY.

46
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:44,906
SO MY QUESTION IS, WHY WOULD YOU
WANT THE WORST JOB IN THE
WORLD?

47
00:02:44,906 --> 00:02:48,355
>> AS WE ALL KNOW, AS SOON AS
YOU ELECTED MAYOR,

48
00:02:48,355 --> 00:02:50,385
EVERYONE IN
THE CITY IMMEDIATELY HATES YOU.

49
00:02:50,385 --> 00:02:54,458
AND IN THAT WAY, I AM ALREADY
ONE STEP AHEAD OF THE GAME.

50
00:02:55,136 --> 00:02:57,310
>> MR. MAMDANI, SAME QUESTION.

51
00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:00,790
>> I WANT TO BE MAYOR SO I CAN
DELIVER A BETTER NEW YORK,

52
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:04,940
FREE
HEALTH CARE, AFFORDABLE HOUSING,
FREE WI-FI.

53
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:07,390
AS MAYOR, CAN I MAKE THAT
HAPPEN?

54
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:09,558
I'M NOT SURE YET.

55
00:03:09,558 --> 00:03:12,477
BUT TOGETHER, WE'RE GOING TO
FIND OUT.

56
00:03:12,477 --> 00:03:15,778
THAT THE ANSWER IS NO.

57
00:03:16,968 --> 00:03:19,088
>> I GOT TO SAY SOMETHING.

58
00:03:19,088 --> 00:03:21,787
MY OPPONENT, NORMAN VANDANIEL,

59
00:03:21,787 --> 00:03:24,856
IS INEXPERIENCED AND FRANKLY A NEPO BABY,

60
00:03:24,856 --> 00:03:28,396
WHERE MY DAD WAS JUST
GOVERNOR OF NEW YORK.

61
00:03:28,396 --> 00:03:32,331
>> OF COURSE, AS YOU KNOW, MY
DAD WAS BRUTALLY KIDNAPPED

62
00:03:32,331 --> 00:03:36,489
AND
TIED TO THE TRACKS OF THE
CYCLONE AT CONEY ISLAND.

63
00:03:37,106 --> 00:03:39,422
I'M SORRY, WHAT WAS YOUR
QUESTION?

64
00:03:39,422 --> 00:03:44,390
>> WHY DO YOU WANT TO BE MAYOR?
>> OH, I NEED A JOB.

65
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:47,484
>> ALL RIGHT, LET'S MOVE ON TO
MOST IMPORTANT QUESTION TONIGHT.

66
00:03:47,484 --> 00:03:50,781
WHAT'S YOUR GO-TO BAGEL ORDER?
MR. MAMDANI?

67
00:03:50,781 --> 00:03:54,948
>> WHAT I'D LIKE IS FOR THE
PERSON SERVING ME THAT BAGEL

68
00:03:54,948 --> 00:03:57,950
TO
BE PAID A LIVING WAGE.

69
00:04:00,123 --> 00:04:04,393
>> BOO!
RELAX, NERD.

70
00:04:04,393 --> 00:04:07,211
MR. CUOMO, GO-TO BAGEL ORDER?

71
00:04:07,211 --> 00:04:11,256
>> I SWEAR TO GOD I AM NOT
SAYING THIS TO PANDER TO JEWISH
VOTERS.

72
00:04:11,256 --> 00:04:15,843
BUT IT'S A GEFILTE FISH EATEN IN
A BOOTH WITH BARBRA STREISAND

73
00:04:15,843 --> 00:04:17,907
BY THE LIGHT OF A MENORAH.

74
00:04:19,442 --> 00:04:22,619
>> ONCE AGAIN, BOO.

75
00:04:22,619 --> 00:04:25,818
MR. SLIWA, GO-TO BAGEL ORDER.

76
00:04:25,818 --> 00:04:29,752
>> AS YOU KNOW, IN 1982, I HAD
MY PENIS CUT OFF

77
00:04:29,752 --> 00:04:32,726
AND FED TO ME
BY THE YAKUZA.

78
00:04:32,726 --> 00:04:37,099
OBVIOUSLY BLUEBERRY BAGEL, STRAWBERRY
CREAM CHEESE

79
00:04:37,099 --> 00:04:39,167
EATEN OVER A GAR
BACK CAN.

80
00:04:39,167 --> 00:04:41,079
>> THANK YOU, CANDIDATES.

81
00:04:41,079 --> 00:04:44,696
TAKE A MOMENT
LET'S THANK A FEW MORE OF
TONIGHT'S SPONSORS,

82
00:04:44,696 --> 00:04:46,143
PEDICABS.

83
00:04:46,143 --> 00:04:50,061
SLOWER THAN WALKING, LOUDER THAN
HELL.

84
00:04:50,061 --> 00:04:51,982
AND HUDSON YARDS.

85
00:04:51,982 --> 00:04:54,644
SHOP, DINE, OR TAKE THE EASY WAY OUT

86
00:04:54,644 --> 00:04:56,755
AT HUDSON YARDS.

87
00:05:00,542 --> 00:05:04,471
MOVING ON.
MOVING ON TO OUR NEXT TOPIC,

88
00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:07,079
WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO SAY TO
UNDECIDED VOTERS?

89
00:05:07,079 --> 00:05:08,974
GOVERNOR CUOMO, LET'S START WITH
YOU.

90
00:05:08,974 --> 00:05:12,472
>> LISTEN, I HAVE ACTUAL
GOVERNING EXPERIENCE.

91
00:05:12,472 --> 00:05:14,905
I HAVE THE RELATIONSHIPS TO GET
THE JOB DONE

92
00:05:14,905 --> 00:05:18,275
AND THE SUPPORT OF
SOME OF THE FINEST PEOPLE IN THE
CITY.

93
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:22,231
>> LIKE ME, MAYOR ERIC ADAMS.

94
00:05:22,231 --> 00:05:25,005
THIS IS MY GUY RIGHT HERE, MAN.
LISTEN UP.

95
00:05:25,005 --> 00:05:27,242
IF YOU LIKE ME, YOU GONNA LOVE
THIS GUY!

96
00:05:27,242 --> 00:05:29,542
HE LIKE ME PART TWO!

97
00:05:29,542 --> 00:05:32,208
>> WELL, NO, ERIC.
REMEMBER THE PLAN.

98
00:05:32,208 --> 00:05:34,463
>> OH, OH, YEAH I GOT YOU.
I GOT YOU.

99
00:05:34,463 --> 00:05:36,864
I, ERIC ADAMS, ENDORSE HIM,

100
00:05:36,928 --> 00:05:39,194
ZORDAN MAMAGRAMMA.

101
00:05:39,956 --> 00:05:42,377
>> NO, NO, NO THANK YOU.

102
00:05:42,377 --> 00:05:46,424
>> MR. MAMDANI, YOUR MESSAGE TO
UNDECIDED VOTERS?

103
00:05:46,424 --> 00:05:49,353
>> MY MESSAGE IS THIS.

104
00:05:51,473 --> 00:05:55,386
HEY, GIRL.
I KNOW YOU GOT A LITTLE WHITE
GUILT

105
00:05:55,386 --> 00:05:58,552
FOR GENTRIFYING THAT
SPANISH NEIGHBORHOOD, DON'T YOU?

106
00:05:58,552 --> 00:06:00,509
WHY DON'T YOU VOTE FOR ME?

107
00:06:00,509 --> 00:06:03,548
YOU KNOW YOU'LL FEEL A LITTLE
LESS BAD ABOUT THAT CHICKEN AND
RICE SHOP

108
00:06:03,548 --> 00:06:05,902
GETTING TURNED INTO A
SWEETGREENS.

109
00:06:05,902 --> 00:06:08,973
WHY DON'T YOU HIT ME UP AT THE
BALLOT BOX, GIRL?

110
00:06:12,122 --> 00:06:14,494
>> MR. MAMDANI,

111
00:06:14,494 --> 00:06:18,033
YOU WERE WARNED
THAT THIS IS THE FORUM FOR YOUR
TIKTOKRY.

112
00:06:18,033 --> 00:06:22,686
MR. SLIWA, WHY SHOULD NEW
YORKERS VOTE FOR YOU?

113
00:06:22,686 --> 00:06:25,356
>> IT'S SIMPLE.
I'M THE ONLY CANDIDATE HERE

114
00:06:25,356 --> 00:06:28,830
WHO'S BEEN DANGLED WE MY
TESTICLES OVER THE VERAZZANO BRIDGE

115
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:32,649
BY A LITTLE-KNOWN GANG
CALLED THE LORDS OF FLATBUSH.

116
00:06:32,649 --> 00:06:37,751
I WAS ALSO POURED INTO THE
FOUNDATION OF GIANTS STADIUM AND
CRAWLED MY WAY OUT.

117
00:06:37,751 --> 00:06:40,639
JUST ON MY WAY HERE, I WAS
EJACULATED UPON

118
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:45,353
DINER
SPIDER

119
00:06:46,508 --> 00:06:50,515
JUST ON YOUR WAY HERE?

120
00:06:50,515 --> 00:06:52,226
ALL RIGHT, LET'S MOVE ON.

121
00:06:52,226 --> 00:06:56,104
FROM CONGESTION PRICING TO
HOMELESSNESS TO I.C.E. RAIDS,

122
00:06:56,104 --> 00:06:58,432
THERE ARE MANY ISSUES FACING OUR
CITY.

123
00:06:58,432 --> 00:07:02,289
WHAT DO YOU THINK IS THE BIGGEST
PROBLEM YOU HAVE TO CONFRONT AS
MAYOR?

124
00:07:02,289 --> 00:07:04,664
>> IT'S ME!

125
00:07:04,664 --> 00:07:09,138
YES.
THEY CAN PRETEND THIS ELECTION
IS ABOUT HOUSING AND TAXES,

126
00:07:09,138 --> 00:07:11,089
BUT
WE ALL KNOW IT'S ABOUT ME,
RIGHT?

127
00:07:11,089 --> 00:07:14,350
BECAUSE I'M GOING TO BE VERY
INVOLVED, VERY HANDS-ON.

128
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:17,465
THIS GUY KNOWS ABOUT HANDS ON,
RIGHT, CUOMO?

129
00:07:17,465 --> 00:07:19,310
>> HEY-YO, YOU GOT ME.

130
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:22,612
>> LOOK AT THESE CANDIDATES WE
GOT.
LOOK AT CURTIS SLIWA.

131
00:07:22,612 --> 00:07:24,515
I LOVE HIM, BUT WE'VE GOT TO DO
SOMETHING

132
00:07:24,515 --> 00:07:27,312
ABOUT THAT "EMILY IN
PARIS" LOOKING HAT, RIGHT?

133
00:07:27,312 --> 00:07:29,672
HE'S MY "RUSHMORE" MAX!

134
00:07:29,672 --> 00:07:35,171
AND THE FRONT-RUNNER ZORA
MAMDANI.

135
00:07:35,172 --> 00:07:39,942
MCKENZEY

136
00:07:39,942 --> 00:07:42,596
HE'S TOO YOUNG TO LEAD, FOLKS,
HE'S TOO YOUNG.

137
00:07:42,596 --> 00:07:44,699
HE DOESN'T HAVE THE WOBBLY WALK.

138
00:07:44,805 --> 00:07:48,396
OR FRANKLY THE MIND I HAVE.
GOOD BRAIN.

139
00:07:48,396 --> 00:07:53,059
I TOOK A COGNITIVE TEST.
I DID SO WELL ON MY COGNITIVE TEST

140
00:07:53,059 --> 00:07:56,321
THAT THEY IMMEDIATELY GAVE
ME AN MRI.

141
00:07:56,321 --> 00:07:59,545
THEY SAID THEY'D NEVER SEEN
ANYTHING LIKE IT.

142
00:07:59,545 --> 00:08:04,113
BUT IN TERMS OF ELECTION, I'D
LIKE TO GO BACK TO THAT VERY
IMPORTANT QUESTION.

143
00:08:04,113 --> 00:08:09,068
THE BAGEL.
MY GO-TO BAGEL ORDER IS BIG MAC
WITH A HOLE IN THE MIDDLE.

144
00:08:09,068 --> 00:08:13,559
AND I MAY NOT LIVE IN NEW YORK
ANYMORE, AWW!

145
00:08:14,646 --> 00:08:18,822
BUT I'M ALWAYS WATCHING.
LURKING IN THE SHADOWS.

146
00:08:18,822 --> 00:08:25,687
MUCH LIKE THE LATE, GREAT

147
00:08:25,689 --> 00:08:28,390
PHANTOM OF THE OPERA.

148
00:08:28,392 --> 00:08:29,157
TERRIBLE, WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM

149

REGARD TO BEING BURNED BY

151
00:08:35,566 --> 00:08:36,198
CHANDELIER.

152
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,066
PERHAPS I'LL ADD "NEW YORK

>> THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK

170
00:11:44,554 --> 00:11:46,588
YOU VERY MUCH.

171
00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:47,389
I AM SO HAPPY TO BE BACK HOSTING

172
00:11:47,391 --> 00:11:49,991
SNL.

173
00:11:49,993 --> 00:11:50,492
THE LAST TIME --

174
00:11:52,863 --> 00:11:53,261
THANK YOU.

175
00:11:53,263 --> 00:11:56,398
THE LAST TIME I HOSTED WAS IN

176
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:56,698
2022.

177
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:58,266
IT MEANS A LOT TO BE HERE FOR

178
00:11:58,268 --> 00:11:58,967
ME, ESPECIALLY ON HALLOWEEN

179
00:11:58,969 --> 00:12:02,103
WEEKEND.

180
00:12:02,105 --> 00:12:03,405
YEAH, BECAUSE WHEN I WAS A KID,

181
00:12:03,407 --> 00:12:05,507
ME AND MY SISTERS USED TO GO

182
00:12:05,509 --> 00:12:06,174
TRICK-OR-TREATING AS "SNL"

183
00:12:06,176 --> 00:12:07,976
CHARACTERS.

184
00:12:07,978 --> 00:12:10,779
SO I DON'T KNOW IF YOU REMEMBER

185
00:12:10,781 --> 00:12:14,048
THE NIGHT OF THE ROCKSBURY GUYS.

186
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:18,753
THEY'RE THE BEST.

187
00:12:18,755 --> 00:12:20,388
WILL FERRELL, CHRIS McCANN.

188
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:21,289
WHERE ARE THEY?

189
00:12:21,291 --> 00:12:22,056
THERE THEY ARE.

190
00:12:22,058 --> 00:12:23,758
WE WENT AS THEM ONE YEAR, AND

191
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:24,426
HERE'S A PHOTO OF ME AND MY

192
00:12:24,428 --> 00:12:24,893
SISTERS.

193
00:12:32,436 --> 00:12:34,769
I MEAN, HONESTLY, I'M JUST NOW

194
00:12:34,771 --> 00:12:35,970
REALIZING HOW FAR OFF WE WERE

195
00:12:35,972 --> 00:12:37,138
WITH THAT LOOK.

196
00:12:38,875 --> 00:12:39,574
IT'S LIKE WE JUST LOOK LIKE

197
00:12:39,576 --> 00:12:40,575
LITTLE GREEK MEN.

198
00:12:40,977 --> 00:12:42,377
IT MUST HAVE BEEN SO CONFUSING,

199
00:12:42,379 --> 00:12:43,678
ME AND MY SISTERS GOING UP TO

200
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:44,212
DOORS JUST LIKE --

201
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:55,690
BUT GROWING UP, I MOVED AROUND A

202
00:12:55,692 --> 00:12:55,957
LOT.

203
00:12:55,959 --> 00:12:58,793
SO "SNL" HAS ALWAYS BEEN ONE OF

204
00:12:58,795 --> 00:13:01,095
THE MORE CONSISTENT PARTS OF MY

205
00:13:01,097 --> 00:13:01,396
LIFE.

206
00:13:01,398 --> 00:13:02,730
I LIVED IN PENNSYLVANIA,

207
00:13:02,732 --> 00:13:04,699
GEORGIA, DELAWARE, JERSEY, AND

208
00:13:04,701 --> 00:13:05,033
FLORIDA.

209
00:13:05,035 --> 00:13:07,001
ALL BEFORE I WAS 12.

210
00:13:07,003 --> 00:13:09,671
SO HONESTLY, IT GETS A BIT

211
00:13:09,673 --> 00:13:11,306
CONFUSING WHEN PEOPLE ASK ME

212
00:13:11,308 --> 00:13:12,073
WHERE I'M FROM.

213
00:13:12,075 --> 00:13:13,908
I'M LIKE, I DON'T KNOW, MAN,

214
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:14,309
TOP GUN 2?

215
00:13:16,613 --> 00:13:18,146
WHERE ARE YOU FROM?

216
00:13:18,148 --> 00:13:19,881
BUT THAT'S WHY I LOVE COMING

217
00:13:19,883 --> 00:13:20,181
HERE.

218
00:13:20,183 --> 00:13:20,782
BECAUSE I HAVE A LOT OF

219
00:13:20,784 --> 00:13:22,917
MEMORIES.

220
00:13:22,919 --> 00:13:23,852
LIKE RIGHT THERE.

221
00:13:23,854 --> 00:13:24,519
THAT'S WHERE I HAD MY FIRST

222
00:13:24,521 --> 00:13:24,819
BEER.

223
00:13:26,656 --> 00:13:27,388
NOT EVER.

224
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:27,856
JUST LIKE TODAY.

225
00:13:30,126 --> 00:13:30,992
AND OVER THERE.

226
00:13:30,994 --> 00:13:32,494
OH, THAT'S WHERE I ALMOST FELL

227
00:13:32,496 --> 00:13:33,928
GETTING OUT OF MY COSTUME.

228
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:35,463
AND RIGHT THERE, THAT'S WHERE

229
00:13:35,465 --> 00:13:38,099
BOWEN SAID, "MILES, YOU PROBABLY

230
00:13:38,101 --> 00:13:39,667
FELL BECAUSE YOU HAD SO MANY

231
00:13:39,669 --> 00:13:40,168
BEERS."

232
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:41,569
I JUST LOVE MEMORIES.

233
00:13:41,571 --> 00:13:43,538
REALLY NICE JUST TO REFLECT.

234
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:45,340
BUT HONESTLY, GUYS, I'M SO HAPPY

235
00:13:45,342 --> 00:13:47,308
TO BE HERE WITH ALL OF YOU.

236
00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:48,510
A LOT HAS HAPPENED SINCE THE

237
00:13:48,512 --> 00:13:50,011
LAST TIME THAT I HOSTED.

238
00:13:50,013 --> 00:13:52,580
A FEW MONTHS AGO, MY WIFE AND I

239
00:13:52,582 --> 00:13:54,249
LOST OUR HOUSE IN THE PALISADES

240
00:13:54,251 --> 00:13:54,549
FIRE.

241
00:13:54,551 --> 00:13:55,817
BUT DON'T WORRY.

242
00:13:55,819 --> 00:13:58,653
SERIOUSLY, DO NOT WORRY.

243
00:13:58,655 --> 00:13:59,220
WE'RE DOING GREAT.

244
00:13:59,222 --> 00:14:00,822
I SEE YOU UP THERE, BABY.

245
00:14:00,824 --> 00:14:02,357
BUT THAT EXPERIENCE HAS MADE ME

246
00:14:02,359 --> 00:14:03,224
INCREDIBLY GRATEFUL TO HAVE SO

247
00:14:03,226 --> 00:14:05,360
MANY PLACES THAT I CAN CALL

248
00:14:05,362 --> 00:14:05,660
HOME.

249
00:14:05,662 --> 00:14:07,161
BUT BASED ON WHAT HAPPENED TO

250
00:14:07,163 --> 00:14:08,296
THE LAST PLACE THAT I CALLED

251
00:14:08,298 --> 00:14:11,099
HOME, I JUST WANT TO SAY --

252
00:14:11,101 --> 00:14:12,300
THERE'S FIRE EXITS LOCATED

253
00:14:12,302 --> 00:14:13,835
THERE, THERE, THERE.

254
00:14:14,237 --> 00:14:15,236
WE GOT TWO IN THE BACK.

255
00:14:15,238 --> 00:14:15,837
THANK YOU, GUYS.

256
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:16,504
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A GREAT

257
00:14:16,506 --> 00:14:16,804
SHOW.

258
00:14:43,833 --> 00:14:45,633
>>> IT'S "WHAT DID I DO LAST

259
00:14:45,635 --> 00:14:45,967
NIGHT?"

260
00:14:45,969 --> 00:14:47,669
AND HERE'S YOUR HOST.

261
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,372
>> HELLO.

262
00:14:51,374 --> 00:14:53,441
HELLO, HELLO, HELLO.

263
00:14:53,443 --> 00:14:54,242
I AM YOUR HOST, GAY FOPAY.

264
00:14:57,247 --> 00:14:59,080
AND WELCOME BACK TO "WHAT DID I

265
00:14:59,082 --> 00:15:00,014
DO LAST NIGHT?"

266
00:15:00,016 --> 00:15:01,816
THE ONLY GAME SHOW WHERE THREE

267
00:15:01,818 --> 00:15:03,451
DEEPLY HUNGOVER CONTESTANTS HAVE

268
00:15:03,453 --> 00:15:05,954
TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THEY GOT UP

269
00:15:05,956 --> 00:15:06,988
TO THE NIGHT BEFORE.

270
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:09,691
AND OF COURSE, TODAY IS OUR

271
00:15:09,693 --> 00:15:10,825
EXTRA-PAINFUL DAY AFTER

272
00:15:10,827 --> 00:15:11,326
HALLOWEEN EDITION.

273
00:15:11,328 --> 00:15:14,862
LET'S MEET OUR PLAYERS.

274
00:15:14,864 --> 00:15:18,333

275
00:15:18,335 --> 00:15:21,736
>> FIRST UP WE'VE GOT KENNETH

276
00:15:21,738 --> 00:15:22,570

277
00:15:22,572 --> 00:15:23,571
HELLO, KENNETH.

278
00:15:23,573 --> 00:15:24,672
OH, MAN, STINKS OVER HERE.

279
00:15:24,674 --> 00:15:28,076
>> YEAH, I CLAWED THE CASTLE

280
00:15:28,078 --> 00:15:28,509
LAST NIGHT.

281
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:29,877
>> WHAT'S THAT?

282
00:15:29,879 --> 00:15:32,447
>> WHEN YOU DRANK 14 WHITE CLAWS

283
00:15:32,449 --> 00:15:33,615
AND EAT WHITE CASTLE.

284
00:15:34,017 --> 00:15:35,850
>> YOU GOT A DEATH WISH,

285
00:15:35,852 --> 00:15:36,184
BROTHER.

286
00:15:36,186 --> 00:15:37,518

MEXICO.

288
00:15:37,854 --> 00:15:38,419
WHAT WAS YOUR COSTUME?

289
00:15:38,421 --> 00:15:40,722
>> SEXY CAT.

290
00:15:40,724 --> 00:15:41,456
>> I'M SURE IT STARTED THAT WAY.

291
00:15:44,361 --> 00:15:45,727
IF YOU WERE AT THE SHELTER,

292
00:15:45,729 --> 00:15:47,795
YOU'D BE PUT DOWN, GIRL.

293

00:15:55,438 --> 00:15:56,904
I WAS SHAKING WHEN I WROTE THAT.

297
00:15:56,906 --> 00:15:59,140
>> YEAH, OKAY.

298
00:15:59,142 --> 00:16:00,375
LOUIS, TELL THEM WHAT THEY'RE

299

WIN.

311
00:16:13,757 --> 00:16:15,723
KENNETH, YOU'RE UP FIRST.

WHAT WAS YOUR UBER FAUX PAS?

313

>> OH, SO CLOSE.

322
00:16:38,481 --> 00:16:40,081
THAT WAS ACTUALLY A TRICK

323
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:40,448
QUESTION.

324
00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:41,816
YOU DID PUKE, BUT IT WASN'T IN

325
00:16:41,818 --> 00:16:42,583
AN UBER.

326
00:16:42,585 --> 00:16:43,918
YOU JUST SAW A GUY IN A CAMRY,

327
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:44,385
AND YOU GOT IN.

LOT.

330
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:52,126
>> DOESN'T MATTER.

331
00:16:52,128 --> 00:16:53,728
YOUR PENALTY IS -- LISTENING TO

332

YOUR QUESTION IS, WHO DID YOU

341
00:17:10,413 --> 00:17:11,145
BITE, AND WHERE DID YOU BITE

342
00:17:11,147 --> 00:17:11,446
THEM?

343
00:17:11,448 --> 00:17:13,781
>> I BIT SOMEONE?

344
00:17:13,783 --> 00:17:15,149

>> OH, OH -- MY TONGUE HURTS

351
00:17:28,598 --> 00:17:30,932
TODAY, SO I'M THINKING "B,"

352
00:17:30,934 --> 00:17:31,499
MYSELF.

353
00:17:31,501 --> 00:17:33,468
>> NO.

354
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:34,135

360
00:17:43,079 --> 00:17:46,013
>> HEY, I'M SURE YOU HEARD, BUT

361
00:17:46,015 --> 00:17:47,482
THINGS HAVEN'T BEEN GOING GREAT

362
00:17:47,484 --> 00:17:48,182

RENOVATE THE DARN THING.

>> I MARRIED THE NEW GIRL.

451

>> DONALD AND MELANIA MOVED INTO

452
00:20:38,154 --> 00:20:39,153
THIS HOUSE NINE YEARS AGO.

453
00:20:39,155 --> 00:20:42,590
THEY WERE EVICTED FOR FOUR

454
00:20:42,592 --> 00:20:45,927
YEARS, BUT THEY MOVED BACK IN.

455
00:20:45,929 --> 00:20:46,594
DONALD HAS A STRONG EYE FOR

456
00:20:46,596 --> 00:20:48,496
INTERIOR DESIGN.

457
00:20:48,498 --> 00:20:49,130

LIKE A HUNDRED IN EVERY ROOM.

460
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:51,265
THAT MAKES ME HAPPY.

461
00:20:51,267 --> 00:20:51,999
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO BE HAPPY

THESE DAYS.

463

REALLY DARK STUFF HAPPENING IN

464
00:20:54,737 --> 00:20:55,503
THE WORLD.

465

AND HERE'S A CROWN I JUST GOT

467
00:20:59,509 --> 00:21:02,009
FROM MY TRIP TO ASIA.

468
00:21:02,011 --> 00:21:02,710
NOTHING SAYS DEMOCRACY LIKE A

469
00:21:02,712 --> 00:21:07,515
CROWN, RIGHT?

470
00:21:07,517 --> 00:21:08,249

475
00:21:15,158 --> 00:21:15,890
>> THE TRUMPS HAVE ALREADY MADE

476

A FEW SUBTLE CHANGES TO THE

477
00:21:16,626 --> 00:21:21,395
HOUSE.

HIMSELF AS A SOLDIER FROM

480
00:21:23,366 --> 00:21:24,732
HALO.

481
00:21:27,003 --> 00:21:28,002
>> YOU KNOW YOU CAN'T SAY MASTER

482
00:21:28,004 --> 00:21:28,836
CHIEF ANYMORE.

483
00:21:28,838 --> 00:21:29,770
RIGHT?

484
00:21:29,772 --> 00:21:31,238
YOU'VE GOT TO SAY PRIMARY CHIEF.

485
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,273
>> THEY ALSO PAVED THE ROSE

486
00:21:32,275 --> 00:21:33,507
GARDEN AND TURNED IT INTO WHAT

487
00:21:33,509 --> 00:21:34,508
LOOKS LIKE OUTDOOR SKATING AT AN

488
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:38,479
OLIVE GARDEN.

489
00:21:38,481 --> 00:21:40,081
DONALD AND MELANIA STILL FEEL

490
00:21:40,083 --> 00:21:41,515
LIKE SOMETHING'S MISSING.

491

492
00:21:42,251 --> 00:21:43,017
SQUARE FEET.

493
00:21:43,019 --> 00:21:44,018
AND 132 ROOMS.

494
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:46,120
>> WE NEED MORE SPACE!

495
00:21:46,122 --> 00:21:46,887
RIGHT?

496
00:21:46,889 --> 00:21:48,389
WE NEED MORE SPACE!

497
00:21:48,391 --> 00:21:50,124
>> WE NEED A BALLROOM BECAUSE

498
00:21:50,126 --> 00:21:51,125
DONALD, HE LOVES TO DANCE.

499
00:21:51,127 --> 00:21:54,128
>> I'M A TERRIFIC DANCER.

500
00:21:54,130 --> 00:21:58,632
TERRIFIC DANCER.

501
00:21:58,634 --> 00:21:59,166
JUST ASK YOUR EYES.

502
00:21:59,168 --> 00:22:00,134
RIGHT?

503
00:22:00,636 --> 00:22:01,635
>> WE ASKED DONALD WHAT HIS

504
00:22:01,637 --> 00:22:02,370
BUDGET WAS, AND HE SAID BETWEEN

505
00:22:02,372 --> 00:22:03,738
$350 MILLION AND INFINITY.

506
00:22:05,041 --> 00:22:08,509
THEN WE ASKED IF HE NEEDED A

507
00:22:08,511 --> 00:22:09,176
PERMIT, AND DONALD LAUGHED

508
00:22:09,178 --> 00:22:09,777
REALLY HARD.

509
00:22:09,779 --> 00:22:10,511
HE SAID, I COULD BUILD THIS

510
00:22:10,513 --> 00:22:11,245
BALLROOM WITH THE BONES OF MY

511
00:22:11,247 --> 00:22:12,246
ENEMIES, AND NO ONE COULD STOP

512
00:22:12,248 --> 00:22:12,947
ME, AS OPPOSED TO A BONEHEAD

513
00:22:12,949 --> 00:22:13,748
LIKE MY BROTHER.

514
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:18,986
>> OH, YOU HUSH UP.

515
00:22:18,988 --> 00:22:22,189
>> WE SHOWED DONALD OUR PLAN FOR

516
00:22:22,191 --> 00:22:23,791
A BALLROOM THAT WOULD MATCH THE

517
00:22:23,793 --> 00:22:24,959
CURRENT PROPORTIONS, BUT HE KEPT

518
00:22:24,961 --> 00:22:27,461
CLICKING "ENLARGE."

519
00:22:27,463 --> 00:22:28,863
>> THEY CAN DRIVE AROUND IT.

520
00:22:28,865 --> 00:22:29,530
OH, I WANT A RING FOR MMA

521
00:22:29,532 --> 00:22:31,265

OFFICIAL ONES BUT ALSO CASUAL

523
00:22:32,001 --> 00:22:32,767
FIGHTS IN THE BACKYARD, YOU KNOW

524
00:22:32,769 --> 00:22:34,001
WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT?

525
00:22:34,003 --> 00:22:35,002
TWO MENTALLY ILL GUYS JUST

526
00:22:35,004 --> 00:22:36,270
WHALING ON EACH OTHER.

527
00:22:36,272 --> 00:22:37,505
DO BUM FIGHTS AGAIN.

528
00:22:37,507 --> 00:22:38,506
REMEMBER BUM FIGHTS?

529
00:22:38,508 --> 00:22:43,911
WE LOVE BUM FIGHTS!

530
00:22:43,913 --> 00:22:46,180
>> TO NAIL DOWN THE STYLE OF THE

531
00:22:46,182 --> 00:22:48,449
BALLROOM, WE ASKED DONALD TO

532
00:22:48,451 --> 00:22:51,018
COME UP WITH A BOARD.

533
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:52,686
>> THIS KIND OF GUY AND THIS

534
00:22:52,688 --> 00:22:53,587
GUY -- I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE

535
00:22:53,589 --> 00:22:54,889
MET HIM, BUT HE'S A GREAT GUY.

536
00:22:54,891 --> 00:22:55,623
THEN SOMETHING LIKE THIS COULD

537
00:22:55,625 --> 00:22:57,158
ALSO BE NICE.

538
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:57,892
>> I TOLD DONALD OUR NUMBER ONE

539
00:22:57,894 --> 00:22:58,592
PRIORITY WAS TO PRESERVE THE

540
00:22:58,594 --> 00:22:59,326
HISTORIC NATURE OF THE BUILDING.

541
00:22:59,328 --> 00:23:00,361
HE SENT ME BACK THIS GIF.

542
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:01,829
WE DEMOLISHED THE ENTIRE EAST

543
00:23:01,831 --> 00:23:06,367
WING IN TWO DAYS.

544
00:23:06,369 --> 00:23:08,135

DOWN AND SO MANY WORKERS

546
00:23:09,405 --> 00:23:10,137
FURLOUGHED, WE WERE ABLE TO

00:23:10,139 --> 00:23:10,871
FORCE PARK RANGERS AND

548
00:23:10,873 --> 00:23:14,375

549
00:23:14,377 --> 00:23:15,409
CHEM DEMOLITION.

THEATER?

553
00:23:18,114 --> 00:23:18,846
BILL CLINTON CALLED IT THE BEST

554
00:23:18,848 --> 00:23:21,015
PERK OF BEING PRESIDENT.

555
00:23:21,017 --> 00:23:22,783
>> BILL CLINTON SAID THAT?

556
00:23:22,785 --> 00:23:23,484
HE SAID THE BEST PERK FOR HIM

557
00:23:23,486 --> 00:23:24,819
WAS THE MOVIE THEATER?

558
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:28,489
>> UNFORTUNATELY THE RENOVATION

559
00:23:28,491 --> 00:23:29,256
HIT A BIT OF A SNAG WHEN DONALD

560
00:23:29,258 --> 00:23:31,025
REALIZED HE HAD DEPORTED ALL THE

561
00:23:31,027 --> 00:23:32,259

INTO THE HOME DEPOT PARKING LOT

563
00:23:33,496 --> 00:23:34,261

WHITES."

565
00:23:36,999 --> 00:23:38,265
I WANT THE DAY LABORERS FROM

566
00:23:38,267 --> 00:23:39,767

APPARENTLY THEY DON'T EXIST.

568
00:23:43,973 --> 00:23:45,873
>> BUT IN THE END, WE'RE

569
00:23:45,875 --> 00:23:46,640
CONFIDENT THE NEW BALLROOM WILL

570
00:23:46,642 --> 00:23:47,374
BE A SHINING BEACON OF FREEDOM

571

831
00:30:53,102 --> 00:30:54,468
>> WHEN'S HER BIRTHDAY?

832
00:30:54,470 --> 00:30:55,736
>> SUMMER.

833
00:30:55,738 --> 00:30:56,970
>> DID YOU CONTACT HER PARENTS?

834
00:30:56,972 --> 00:30:58,305
>> YES, I CALLED THEM AND SAID,

835
00:30:58,307 --> 00:31:01,775
YOUR DAUGHTER IS DEAD.

836
00:31:01,777 --> 00:31:04,711
>> I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT I WAS

837
00:31:04,713 --> 00:31:05,012
DOING.

838
00:31:05,014 --> 00:31:06,113
SOMEBODY TOOK MY WIFE!

839
00:31:06,115 --> 00:31:09,816
I HAVE A GUN, AND I'M NOT -- OH!

840
00:31:09,818 --> 00:31:12,286
>> AND NOT LONG AFTER SHE LEFT,

841
00:31:12,288 --> 00:31:13,687
THESE TWO SMALL MEN CAME OUT THE

842
00:31:13,689 --> 00:31:14,054
BASEMENT.

843
00:31:14,056 --> 00:31:15,088
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

844
00:31:15,090 --> 00:31:16,490
WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?

845
00:31:16,492 --> 00:31:20,127
>> OUR SONS.

846
00:31:20,129 --> 00:31:21,828
I THINK YOU FORGOT WE HAVE KIDS.

847
00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:23,897
>> NO, NO!

848
00:31:23,899 --> 00:31:25,899
>> AFTER ABOUT 24 HOURS, I DID

849
00:31:25,901 --> 00:31:28,268
DECIDE IT WAS TIME TO MOVE ON

850
00:31:28,270 --> 00:31:28,702
ROMANTICALLY.

851
00:31:28,704 --> 00:31:34,741
SO I DOWNLOADED TINDER.

852
00:31:34,743 --> 00:31:36,276
>> THERE WAS NO WAY I COULD HAVE

853
00:31:36,278 --> 00:31:36,610
KNOWN.

854
00:31:36,612 --> 00:31:37,878
>> I'M TELLING YOU NOW, I'M

855
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:39,780
GOING TO SEE MY SISTER IN

00:31:39,782 --> 00:31:40,213
POUGHKEEPSIE.

857
00:31:40,215 --> 00:31:41,014
>> OKAY, BABY, HAVE FUN.

858
00:31:41,016 --> 00:31:42,316
>> I'LL BE BACK SUNDAY.

859

SUNDAY NIGHT.

860
00:31:42,918 --> 00:31:43,283
>> OKAY.

861
00:31:43,285 --> 00:31:45,152

863
00:31:46,422 --> 00:31:48,388
>> SIR, IS THERE ANY PLACE YOU

864
00:31:48,390 --> 00:31:49,323
THINK SHE COULD BE?

865
00:31:49,325 --> 00:31:50,757
>> I KNOW THIS IS PROBABLY

866
00:31:50,759 --> 00:31:54,294
WRONG, BUT -- MAYBE THE BOOB

867
00:31:54,296 --> 00:31:54,595
STORE?

868
00:31:54,597 --> 00:31:57,164
>> "GONE WITH SEVERAL TRACES."

869
00:31:57,166 --> 00:32:01,168
>> SOMETIMES THE SCARIEST THING

870
00:32:01,170 --> 00:32:02,469
IS WHEN -- STEP BACK, NO!

871
00:32:11,981 --> 00:32:15,182

>> IF IT LOOKS A LITTLE

878
00:32:20,689 --> 00:32:21,822
DIFFERENT IN HERE, THAT'S

879
00:32:21,824 --> 00:32:23,290
BECAUSE IT'S OUR FIRST SHOW IN

A PEEK INSIDE OUR NEWSROOM AND

00:32:26,929 --> 00:32:28,629
THE HARD-WORKING FOLKS WHO PUT

883
00:32:28,631 --> 00:32:29,896
ALL THIS TOGETHER.

884
00:32:29,898 --> 00:32:31,131
WELL, LOTS TO DISCUSS TONIGHT.

885
00:32:31,133 --> 00:32:33,200
WE START WITH THE ECONOMY, WHICH

886
00:32:33,202 --> 00:32:36,937
WE'RE PUTTING "IN FOCUS."

887
00:32:36,939 --> 00:32:38,639
THIS WEEK, AMAZON ANNOUNCED

888
00:32:38,641 --> 00:32:40,240
THOUSANDS OF LAYOFFS WITH TARGET

889
00:32:40,242 --> 00:32:43,910
ALSO JOINING THE LIST OF MAJOR

890
00:32:43,912 --> 00:32:45,646
COMPANIES SLASHING ITS

891
00:32:45,648 --> 00:32:46,013
WORKFORCE.

892
00:32:46,015 --> 00:32:47,147
WHILE COMPANIES LOOK TO PROTECT

893
00:32:47,149 --> 00:32:48,015
THEIR BOTTOM LINES, AMERICAN

894
00:32:48,017 --> 00:32:51,084
HOUSEHOLDS ARE DOING THE SAME.

895
00:32:55,691 --> 00:32:56,857
>> OH!

896
00:32:56,859 --> 00:32:57,924
>> ARE YOU OKAY?

897
00:32:57,926 --> 00:32:58,625
>> YEAH, I'M FINE, I'M SORRY.

898
00:32:58,627 --> 00:32:59,426
OH!

899
00:32:59,428 --> 00:33:02,763
>> OKAY.

900
00:33:02,765 --> 00:33:04,698
RISING PRICES FOR GROCERIES AND

901
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:05,098
UTILITIES --

902
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:07,968
>> OH!

903
00:33:07,970 --> 00:33:10,537
OH!

904
00:33:10,539 --> 00:33:10,904
I'M SORRY.

905
00:33:10,906 --> 00:33:11,271
I'M FINE.

906
00:33:11,273 --> 00:33:13,206
I APOLOGIZE.

907
00:33:13,208 --> 00:33:14,808
>> APOLOGIES FOR THAT.

908
00:33:14,810 --> 00:33:15,776
THE BIG QUESTION HERE, IS THIS

909
00:33:15,778 --> 00:33:18,111
THE START OF A LONGER, STEEPER

910
00:33:18,113 --> 00:33:18,445
DECLINE?

911
00:33:18,447 --> 00:33:20,947
>> WELL, DAPHNE, THAT'S UP TO

912
00:33:20,949 --> 00:33:22,849
HOW MUCH OF THIS OVERHEATED A.I.

913
00:33:22,851 --> 00:33:23,984
SECTOR IS EVEN REAL.

914
00:33:23,986 --> 00:33:25,919
IF IT'S A BUBBLE, IT'S GOING TO

915
00:33:25,921 --> 00:33:26,553
BURST SOONER OR LATER.

916
00:33:26,555 --> 00:33:27,754
>> LET'S HOPE IT DOESN'T BURST,

917
00:33:27,756 --> 00:33:29,322
WE JUST SPENT A LOT OF MONEY ON

918
00:33:29,324 --> 00:33:30,290
THIS NEW STUDIO.

919
00:33:30,292 --> 00:33:32,259
>> HEY, WHOEVER REPORTED ME TO

920
00:33:32,261 --> 00:33:33,026
HR, SAY IT TO MY FACE NEXT TIME!

921
00:33:36,699 --> 00:33:39,332
>> SORRY.

922
00:33:39,334 --> 00:33:41,101
STILL ADJUSTING TO THE NEW

923
00:33:41,103 --> 00:33:41,435
LAYOUT.

924
00:33:41,437 --> 00:33:42,669
>> ACTUALLY, I THINK IT'S QUITE

925
00:33:42,671 --> 00:33:45,605
AN UPGRADE.

926
00:33:45,607 --> 00:33:46,339
SUCH A FUN LITTLE TREAT FOR THE

927
00:33:46,341 --> 00:33:47,040
VIEWERS TO GET A LITTLE PEEK

928
00:33:47,042 --> 00:33:47,574
BEHIND THE CURTAIN.

929
00:33:50,279 --> 00:33:52,045
>> PROFESSOR, NOW, WHAT DO YOU

930
00:33:52,047 --> 00:33:52,879
MAKE OF THIS?

931
00:33:52,881 --> 00:33:53,580
BECAUSE ON PAPER, INFLATION

932
00:33:53,582 --> 00:33:58,719
RATES ARE PRETTY LOW.

933
00:33:59,822 --> 00:34:02,089
>> WELL, ON THE SCREEN,

934
00:34:02,091 --> 00:34:02,756
INFLATION RATES SEEM PRETTY

935
00:34:02,758 --> 00:34:03,056
HUGE.

936
00:34:10,065 --> 00:34:12,933
>> ALL RIGHT, SOMEONE HACKED MY

937
00:34:12,935 --> 00:34:14,901
COMMUNITY, PUT MANGA ROCK ON IT

938
00:34:14,903 --> 00:34:15,235
AGAIN.

939
00:34:15,237 --> 00:34:16,403
>> YEAH, SURE, BUDDY.

940
00:34:16,405 --> 00:34:18,705
BUT LOOK, PRICES ARE RISING, BUT

941
00:34:18,707 --> 00:34:20,173
SO ARE THE MARKETS.

942
00:34:20,175 --> 00:34:20,807
WE'RE STILL SOLID.

943
00:34:20,809 --> 00:34:21,942
>> EVERYDAY AMERICANS ARE

944
00:34:21,944 --> 00:34:22,976
CERTAINLY STRUGGLING.

945
00:34:22,978 --> 00:34:24,778
RESULTS FROM A NEW SURVEY SHOWED

946
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:26,179
52% OF AMERICANS ARE LIVING

947
00:34:26,181 --> 00:34:31,284
PAYCHECK TO PAYCHECK.

948
00:34:31,286 --> 00:34:33,420
>> OH, SAO PAULO MARKETS, I DO

949
00:34:33,422 --> 00:34:35,822
IT ALL, BABY, PACKING IT --

950
00:34:35,824 --> 00:34:37,023
>> SORRY.

951
00:34:37,025 --> 00:34:38,191
HECTIC NEWS DAY.

952
00:34:38,193 --> 00:34:39,626
AND THIS IS CONCERNING.

953
00:34:39,628 --> 00:34:42,696
1 IN 3 AMERICANS DESCRIBE THEIR

954
00:34:42,698 --> 00:34:44,030
FINANCIAL SITUATION AS IN

955
00:34:44,032 --> 00:34:44,364
CRISIS.

956
00:34:44,366 --> 00:34:45,599
IS THIS JUST THE BEGINNING,

957
00:34:45,601 --> 00:34:45,966
PROFESSOR?

958
00:34:45,968 --> 00:34:50,570
>> WELL, I THINK WE'LL SEE -- I

959
00:34:50,572 --> 00:34:52,639
THINK WE'LL SEE MORE LAYOFFS AND

960
00:34:52,641 --> 00:34:56,076
PRICE HIKES, BUT THE CEILING IS

961
00:34:56,078 --> 00:34:57,778
RAISING THE PRICE -- HEY, EXCUSE

962
00:34:57,780 --> 00:34:58,812
ME, DFNY.

963
00:34:58,814 --> 00:35:02,349
JUST TAKE THE PAPER OUT THE

964
00:35:02,351 --> 00:35:02,649
TRAY!

965
00:35:02,651 --> 00:35:03,350
>> PROFESSOR, YOU WERE SAYING?

966
00:35:03,352 --> 00:35:05,385
>> SORRY.

967
00:35:05,387 --> 00:35:08,054
NOW, THE TARIFFS HAVEN'T HELPED

968
00:35:08,056 --> 00:35:08,388
THINGS.

969
00:35:08,390 --> 00:35:09,456
>> ESPECIALLY WITH THE SUPPLY

970
00:35:09,458 --> 00:35:10,891
CHAIN THAT'S STILL RECOVERING

971
00:35:10,893 --> 00:35:11,458
FROM THE COVID ERA.

972
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:12,759
>> OH!

973
00:35:15,831 --> 00:35:17,697
>> OH, YIKES.

974
00:35:17,699 --> 00:35:19,499
A LITTLE PRINTER ISSUE.

975
00:35:19,501 --> 00:35:20,100
IS EVERYONE OKAY?

976
00:35:20,102 --> 00:35:22,235
>> NO, I JUST GOT ELECTROCUTED,

977
00:35:22,237 --> 00:35:24,237
BITCH!

978
00:35:26,608 --> 00:35:28,041
OKAY, WE'RE GOOD.

979
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:32,913
>> ALL RIGHTY.

980
00:35:32,915 --> 00:35:34,548
PLEASE CONTINUE, PROFESSOR.

981
00:35:34,550 --> 00:35:35,649
>> I'LL GO GET HELP.

982
00:35:35,651 --> 00:35:37,184
>> ACTUALLY, ONE SECOND, I THINK

983
00:35:37,186 --> 00:35:39,019
THIS DUDE IS GOING TO FALL

984
00:35:39,021 --> 00:35:39,319
AGAIN.

985
00:35:39,721 --> 00:35:40,287
YEP, THERE IT IS.

986
00:35:40,289 --> 00:35:42,222
>> WELL, LOOKS LIKE WE'RE AT THE

987

BREAK.

988
00:35:42,724 --> 00:35:45,258
MORE WITH PROFESSOR HENRY AFTER

989
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:45,559

A WALL STAT.

992

00:37:02,104 --> 00:37:03,403
SLOWLY PARTED

1002
00:37:03,405 --> 00:37:04,871
I SAW THE IVORY TOWERS ¶

1003
00:37:04,873 --> 00:37:06,139
¶ BEFORE THE REVOLUTION

1004
00:37:06,141 --> 00:37:08,608
STARTED

1005
00:37:08,610 --> 00:37:09,876
BETWEEN THE MADNESS

1006
00:37:09,878 --> 00:37:12,379
OF THE HOURS ¶

1007
00:37:12,381 --> 00:37:15,382
¶ AND THEY DON'T SEE

1008
00:37:15,384 --> 00:37:19,119
WHAT WE SEE

1009
00:37:19,121 --> 00:37:22,389
BUT WE BELIEVE

1010
00:37:22,391 --> 00:37:27,661
WE BELIEVE ¶

1011
00:37:27,663 --> 00:37:28,628
¶ THAT THEY'RE

1012
00:37:28,630 --> 00:37:30,130
NOT GONNA LIVE FOREVER

GET OUT OF BED ALONE ¶

1033
00:38:20,615 --> 00:38:21,881
¶ WHEN THE FRAILTY

1034

OVERCOMES THEM

1035
00:38:23,151 --> 00:38:25,151

COLIN JOST AND MICHAEL CHE.

1087
00:41:31,406 --> 00:41:32,872
GOOD EVENING, EVERYONE.

1088
00:41:32,874 --> 00:41:35,008
>> WELCOME TO "WEEKEND UPDATE,"

1089
00:41:35,010 --> 00:41:35,642
I'M MICHAEL CHE.

1090

>> I'M COLIN JOST.

1091
00:41:39,748 --> 00:41:40,446
>>> PRESIDENT TRUMP AND THE

1092
00:41:40,448 --> 00:41:42,348
FIRST LADY HOSTED A

1093
00:41:42,350 --> 00:41:43,383
TRICK-OR-TREAT EVENT AT WHAT'S

1094
00:41:43,385 --> 00:41:44,851
LEFT OF THE WHITE HOUSE.

1095
00:41:45,253 --> 00:41:46,019
AND THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE

1096
00:41:46,021 --> 00:41:47,253
THINGS THAT THE PRESIDENT DOES

1097
00:41:47,255 --> 00:41:49,155
BECAUSE IT'S SO CLEAR HE NEVER

1098
00:41:49,157 --> 00:41:50,757
TRICK-OR-TREATED ONCE IN HIS

1099
00:41:50,759 --> 00:41:51,124
LIFE.

1100
00:41:51,126 --> 00:41:52,926
IN HIS FIRST TERM, HERE'S HOW HE

1101
00:41:52,928 --> 00:41:53,760
GAVE CANDY TO A KID DRESSED AS A

1102
00:41:53,762 --> 00:41:57,297
MINION.

1103
00:42:04,105 --> 00:42:05,538
MELANIA'S JUST LIKE, I GUESS

1104
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:06,639
THAT IS HOW IT'S DONE.

1105
00:42:07,042 --> 00:42:08,241
THEN AGAIN THIS YEAR, HE DID IT

1106
00:42:08,243 --> 00:42:09,242
TO A KID DRESSED AS DJ

1107
00:42:09,244 --> 00:42:17,817
MARSHMALLOW.

1108
00:42:18,219 --> 00:42:20,954
JUST PUT IT IN THE BAG.

1109
00:42:20,956 --> 00:42:21,854
WHY IS HE SO WEIRD?

1110
00:42:21,856 --> 00:42:24,057
EVEN THE KID IS LIKE, THIS IS

1111
00:42:24,059 --> 00:42:25,391
NOT RIGHT.

1112
00:42:25,794 --> 00:42:27,493
IT'S KIND OF AN EMBODIMENT OF

1113
00:42:27,495 --> 00:42:28,761
HIS SPIRE PRESIDENCY, BECAUSE

1114
00:42:28,763 --> 00:42:30,496
IT'S JUST A VIOLATION OF NORMS

1115
00:42:30,498 --> 00:42:32,532
THAT NO OTHER PRESIDENT OR

1116
00:42:32,534 --> 00:42:34,534
PERSON HAS EVER CONCEIVED OF.

1117
00:42:34,536 --> 00:42:35,468
LIKE, WHO'S EVER THOUGHT, I

1118
00:42:35,470 --> 00:42:36,135
SHOULD PUT THE CANDY ON THE

1119
00:42:36,137 --> 00:42:36,536
KID'S HEAD.

1120
00:42:38,573 --> 00:42:39,806
MY FAVORE PART, THOUGH, IS

1121
00:42:39,808 --> 00:42:41,307
WHEN TRUMP AND MELANIA MADE A

1122
00:42:41,309 --> 00:42:43,142
GRAND ENTRANCE TO THIS SONG.

1123
00:42:43,144 --> 00:42:54,754
¶¶

1124
00:42:54,756 --> 00:42:56,155
>> MICHAEL JACKSON'S "THRILLER."

1125
00:42:56,157 --> 00:42:58,024
JUST THE PERFECT SOUNDTRACK TO

1126
00:42:58,026 --> 00:42:58,725
LURE KIDS TO A FAMOUS MANSION.

1127
00:43:04,933 --> 00:43:07,300
>>> DUE TO THE GOVERNMENT

1128
00:43:07,302 --> 00:43:12,505
SHUTDOWN, S.N.A.P. BENEFITS RAN

1129
00:43:12,507 --> 00:43:14,841
OUT OF FUNDS TODAY.

1130
00:43:14,843 --> 00:43:16,209
BUT THE GOVERNMENT STILL

1131
00:43:16,211 --> 00:43:17,977
PROVIDES FREE FOOD TO FAMILIES

1132
00:43:17,979 --> 00:43:20,947
THROUGH THE SECOND AMENDMENT.

1133

JAPAN'S NEW PRIME MINISTER SANAE

PEACE PRIZE.

1138
00:43:27,355 --> 00:43:28,788
AND I CAN'T BELIEVE I GET TO SAY

1139
00:43:28,790 --> 00:43:30,223
THIS, BUT THANK GOD NOBODY

1140
00:43:30,225 --> 00:43:32,925
LISTENS TO WOMEN.

1141
00:43:39,067 --> 00:43:40,500

1142
00:43:40,502 --> 00:43:41,367
CHINESE PRESIDENT XI JINPING.

1143
00:43:41,369 --> 00:43:42,869
WHEN ASKED HOW THE MEETING WENT,

1144
00:43:42,871 --> 00:43:43,503
TRUMP SAID THIS.

1145
00:43:43,505 --> 00:43:45,471
>> BUT OVERALL, I GUESS ON THE

1146
00:43:45,473 --> 00:43:47,540
SCALE FROM 0 TO 10 WITH 10 BEING

1147
00:43:47,542 --> 00:43:48,007
THE PEST?

1148
00:43:48,009 --> 00:43:48,708
I WOULD SAY THE MEETING WAS A

1149
00:43:48,710 --> 00:43:49,275
12.

1150
00:43:52,647 --> 00:43:54,080
>> I GUESS TRUMP JUST WANTED TO

1151
00:43:54,082 --> 00:43:55,314
SHOW CHINA WE'RE STILL WAY WORSE

1152
00:43:55,316 --> 00:43:55,648
AT MATH.

1153
00:44:00,422 --> 00:44:02,055
TRUMP ALSO VISITED SOUTH KOREA

1154
00:44:02,057 --> 00:44:04,290
AND WAS GIVEN A GOLD CROWN AND

1155
00:44:04,292 --> 00:44:06,225
SERVED BEEF PATTIES WITH KETCHUP

1156
00:44:06,227 --> 00:44:07,060
FOR DINNER.

1157
00:44:07,062 --> 00:44:08,127
SO THEY BASICALLY GOT THE

1158
00:44:08,129 --> 00:44:09,395
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES A

1159
00:44:09,397 --> 00:44:09,962
HAPPY MEAL WITH A TOY.

1160
00:44:13,635 --> 00:44:15,401
>>> CRITICS OF PRESIDENT TRUMP

1161
00:44:15,403 --> 00:44:17,036
ARE CALLING HIM TONE DEAF FOR

1162
00:44:17,038 --> 00:44:19,205
POSTING PICTURES OF HIS NEWLY

1163

RENOVATED WHITE HOUSE BATHROOM

1164

DURING THE GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN.

1165
00:44:22,077 --> 00:44:23,443
BUT I'M HAPPY THAT THE FLOOR

1166
00:44:23,445 --> 00:44:23,910
LOOKS SLIPPERY.

1167
00:44:31,119 --> 00:44:34,253
>>> THE STATE OF TEXAS IS SUING

1168
00:44:34,255 --> 00:44:35,321

NOT SINCE JASON, ACTUALLY.

1402
00:52:06,974 --> 00:52:10,075
>> WHO IS -- WHO'S JASON?

1403
00:52:10,478 --> 00:52:11,577
IS HE, LIKE, A CONGRESSMAN?

1404
00:52:11,579 --> 00:52:12,077
>> HE'S NOT A MAN.

1405
00:52:17,051 --> 00:52:17,783
>> OKAY.

1406
00:52:17,785 --> 00:52:19,051

BUILD HIS WHOLE BALLROOM DURING

1409
00:52:23,624 --> 00:52:24,390
THE SHUTDOWN.

1410
00:52:24,392 --> 00:52:25,591
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT?

1411
00:52:25,593 --> 00:52:26,458
>> YES.

1412
00:52:26,460 --> 00:52:27,793
TYPICALLY DURING A SHUTDOWN, YOU

1413
00:52:27,795 --> 00:52:28,827
WOULDN'T SEE A PRESIDENT

1414

1417
00:52:31,732 --> 00:52:33,199
LOOK, IT'S TOO BIG.

1418
00:52:33,201 --> 00:52:34,667
WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO TRY

1419
00:52:34,669 --> 00:52:35,167
SOMETHING SMALLER?

1420
00:52:43,844 --> 00:52:45,778
>> YEAH, AND WHO KNOWS.

1421
00:52:45,780 --> 00:52:48,347
REPUBLICANS MIGHT EVEN SAY --

1422
00:52:48,349 --> 00:52:48,914
SMALLER SOUNDS GREAT.

1423
00:52:51,285 --> 00:52:51,684
I PREFER IT.

1424
00:52:52,853 --> 00:52:54,253
>> YOU PREFER IT?

1425
00:52:56,757 --> 00:52:57,756

HOW LONG WERE YOU IN THERE FOR?

1433
00:53:10,338 --> 00:53:11,637
>> OH, GOD.

1434
00:53:11,639 --> 00:53:13,372
LET ME THINK.

1435
00:53:13,374 --> 00:53:16,308
'CAUSE IT WAS COUCH.

1436
00:53:16,310 --> 00:53:16,842
THEN IT WAS A DESK?

1437
00:53:16,844 --> 00:53:17,576
>> NO, WE WANTED TO BUT THERE

1438
00:53:17,578 --> 00:53:18,344
WAS STUFF ON THE DESK.

1439
00:53:18,346 --> 00:53:21,714
>> OH, THAT'S RIGHT, THEN WE DID

1440
00:53:21,716 --> 00:53:22,014
DOOR.

1441
00:53:22,016 --> 00:53:23,449
>> WE WERE AT DOOR FOR A WHILE.

1442
00:53:23,451 --> 00:53:25,784
>> COUCH, THEN DOOR, THEN WE

1443
00:53:25,786 --> 00:53:26,819

1444
00:53:26,821 --> 00:53:27,186
BROTHER.

1445
00:53:27,188 --> 00:53:28,754
>> I LOVED THAT.

1446
00:53:29,156 --> 00:53:30,623
>> JUST KIND OF A LOST GUY, I

1447
00:53:30,625 --> 00:53:31,490
REALLY WORRY ABOUT HIM.

1448
00:53:31,492 --> 00:53:33,025
>> YOU GIVE HIM TOO MUCH, YOU

1449
00:53:33,027 --> 00:53:33,859
GIVE HIM TOO MUCH.

1450

>> YOU SAID THAT, AND I REALLY

1451
00:53:35,463 --> 00:53:35,995
APPRECIATED IT.

1452
00:53:35,997 --> 00:53:36,562
>> YOU'RE SO STRONG.

1453
00:53:36,564 --> 00:53:39,798
>> THANK YOU.

1454
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:40,499
THEN IT WAS MORE DOOR.

1455
00:53:40,501 --> 00:53:42,368
>> IT WAS A LOT OF DOOR.

1456
00:53:42,770 --> 00:53:44,169
A LOT MORE DOOR.

1457

YOU THINK THEY SHOULD GET

1466
00:53:57,918 --> 00:53:58,284
TOGETHER?

1467
00:53:58,286 --> 00:53:59,652
>> OH.

00:53:59,654 --> 00:54:02,888
NO -- NO, LIKE -- I'M NOT SAYING

1469
00:54:02,890 --> 00:54:07,226
THEY NEED TO GET MARRIED.

1470
00:54:07,228 --> 00:54:07,960

1471
00:54:07,962 --> 00:54:09,795
MARRIED.

1472
00:54:09,797 --> 00:54:11,997
>> OKAY, I THINK DEMOCRATS JUST

OUGHT TO JUST LIKE CHILL.

1474

LOVE YOU DURING DOOR?

1480
00:54:25,079 --> 00:54:26,912

THEY SAY DURING DOOR.

1482
00:54:28,382 --> 00:54:30,849
I THINK DEMOCRATS WOULD HAVE

1483

SAID ANYTHING FOR MORE DOOR.
