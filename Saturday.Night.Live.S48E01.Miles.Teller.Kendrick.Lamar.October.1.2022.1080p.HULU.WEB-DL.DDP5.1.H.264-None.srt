1
00:00:02,890 --> 00:00:05,849
MONDAY

2
00:00:05,849 --> 00:00:08,969
>>> HEY, EVERYBODY.
I'M PEYTON MANNING.

3
00:00:12,167 --> 00:00:17,036
>> AM, YEAH, AND I'M ELI
MANNING, HIS BROTHER.

4
00:00:17,036 --> 00:00:20,491
>> YEAH, I THINK THEY KNOW WE'RE
BROTHERS BECAUSE OF THE SAME
LAST NAME.

5
00:00:20,492 --> 00:00:21,938
YEAH

6
00:00:21,939 --> 00:00:27,753
CAST
WHERE WE DO LIVE
ANALYSIS OF WHAT'S ALREADY
PLAYING ON TV.

7
00:00:27,753 --> 00:00:30,576
NORMALLY WE DO IT DURING THE
MONDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL.

8
00:00:30,576 --> 00:00:33,240
>> BUT TONIGHT'S NOT MONDAY.
IT'S SATURDAY.

9
00:00:33,305 --> 00:00:36,262
>> GREAT INCITE, ELI.

10
00:00:36,262 --> 00:00:41,050
>> YEAH.
SO INSTEAD OF FOOTBALL, WE
DECIDED TO CHECK OUT THE SEASON
PREMIER OF SNL.

11
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:44,890
>> THERE ARE A LOT OF CHANGES AT
THE SHOW, WHICH COULD BE
EXCITING.

12
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:48,674
LET'S SEE WHAT THEY SPENT THE
ENTIRE SUMMER COMING UP WITH.

13
00:00:48,674 --> 00:00:52,251
>> OKAY, WE GOT AN ESTABLISHING
SHOT OF MAR-A-LAGO.

14
00:00:52,251 --> 00:00:56,120
>> OH, GOOD.
TRUMP SKETCH.
WAY TO MIX IT UP.

15
00:00:56,434 --> 00:00:59,074
>> MR. PRESIDENT, AS YOUR LAWYER,

16
00:00:59,074 --> 00:01:01,611
I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD
BE HIDING DURING A HURRICANE.

17
00:01:01,611 --> 00:01:04,385
>> ACTUALLY, IT'S THE SAFEST
PLACE I HAVE BEEN IN TWO YEARS.

18
00:01:04,385 --> 00:01:08,314
THERE'S NO LAWYERS, NO FBI.
I'M IN MY HAPPY PLACE.

19
00:01:08,315 --> 00:01:10,706
OKAY.

20
00:01:10,706 --> 00:01:13,749
>> A FEW GUESTS WANTED TO SAY
HELLO, MR. PRESIDENT.

21
00:01:13,749 --> 00:01:16,686
>> PLEASE, CALL ME CURRENT
PRESIDENT.

22
00:01:16,686 --> 00:01:19,850
>> WHY ARE GUESTS VISITING
DURING A HURRICANE?

23
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:24,835
>> ALL RIGHT.
LOOKS LIKE WE GOT A ROOKIE
LEADING A SENIOR CAST MEMBER
INTO THE ROOM.

24
00:01:24,835 --> 00:01:27,889
PROBABLY GOING TO RUN A SIMPLE,
RIGHT THIS WAY, MA'AM.

25
00:01:27,889 --> 00:01:30,139
>> RIGHT THIS WAY, MA'AM.

26
00:01:30,139 --> 00:01:31,773
>> TELEGRAPHED IT.

27
00:01:31,773 --> 00:01:35,148
>> AND HE DOESN'T CLOSE THE DOOR
BEHIND HIM.

28
00:01:35,148 --> 00:01:37,052
NOW HE'S TRYING TO FIX IT.

29
00:01:37,052 --> 00:01:40,171
THE NEW GUY IS FULLY PANICKING.
HE'S JUST STARING IN THE CAMERA.

30
00:01:40,171 --> 00:01:46,069
GOD. AND THAT MIGHT BE THE ONLY
TIME WE SEE HIM TONIGHT.

31
00:01:46,069 --> 00:01:50,038
>> LET'S SEE WHAT HEIDI'S GOT.
SHE'S NEVER LET ME DOWN.

32
00:01:50,038 --> 00:01:53,309
>> SIR, THE GOVERNOR OF SOUTH
DAKOTA IS HERE.

33
00:01:53,309 --> 00:01:55,481
>> HELLO.
I'M GOVERNOR CHRISTY NULL

34
00:01:55,481 --> 00:01:59,895
AND I
WANT TO TAKE YOUR ABORTION
RIGHTS.

35
00:02:00,219 --> 00:02:02,149
>> AND SHE LET ME DOWN.

36
00:02:02,149 --> 00:02:04,748
>> OKAY.
TIME OUT.

37
00:02:04,748 --> 00:02:06,908
WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?

38
00:02:06,908 --> 00:02:09,086
>> THE GOVERNOR OF SOUTH DAKOTA,

39
00:02:09,162 --> 00:02:11,638
A POLITICAL IMPRESSION THAT NO
ONE ASKED FOR.

40
00:02:11,638 --> 00:02:17,189
WHAT ABOUT FUN IMPRESSION LIKE
ANTHONY FAUCI OR LINDSEY GRAHAM
OR RUDY GIULIANI?

41
00:02:17,189 --> 00:02:19,955
>> THOSE WERE ALL KATE McKINNEN.

42
00:02:19,955 --> 00:02:22,022
>> DAMN.

43
00:02:22,199 --> 00:02:26,553
>> I ALSO WANT TO SAY HAPPY
EARLY COLUMBUS DAY, SIR.

44
00:02:26,553 --> 00:02:28,172
>> WE LOVE COLUMBUS.

45
00:02:28,172 --> 00:02:32,816
SAILED RIGHT OFF THE EDGE OF THE
WORLD BUT LANDED IN HAITI AND
GOT TO WORK.

46
00:02:32,816 --> 00:02:35,996
>> I GOT TO POINT OUT, WHERE'S
THE BALANCE POLITICALLY?

47
00:02:35,996 --> 00:02:40,535
THEY'RE MAKING TRUMP-COLUMBUS JOKES,
MEANWHILE, JOE BIDEN'S LOST HIS
MARBLES.

48
00:02:40,535 --> 00:02:42,657
EVEN

49
00:02:42,657 --> 00:02:45,227
>> HOLD THAT THOUGHT.
DONALD JUNIOR IS COMING IN.

50
00:02:45,227 --> 00:02:49,295
DAD. I HATE TO CUT THE PARTY SHORT,

51
00:02:49,295 --> 00:02:51,224
BUT WE GOT TO GET OUT OF
HERE.

52
00:02:51,224 --> 00:02:56,775
THE PRESIDENT OF CHINA CAN ONLY
HOLD SO MANY NUCLEAR SECRETS.

53
00:02:56,775 --> 00:03:00,782
>> LET'S JUST SAY I'M HAPPIER
THAN WHEN THE QUEEN'S CORGIS

54
00:03:00,782 --> 00:03:05,418
FOUND OUT THEY WEREN'T GOING
WITH PRINCE ANDREW.

55
00:03:05,418 --> 00:03:10,972
>> THAT CONFUSED ME, AND DID
BOWEN SAY CORGI,

56
00:03:10,972 --> 00:03:14,013
DOES HE NOT
KNOW IT'S PRONOUNCED ARE CORDY?

57
00:03:14,013 --> 00:03:17,360
>> IT'S A SURPRISE FUMBLE FROM
THE VETERAN YANG.

58
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:21,902
STEP UP
YOU CAN TELL THE PRESSURE IS
GETTING TO HIM.

59
00:03:23,031 --> 00:03:25,520
>> MEANWHILE, LOOKS LIKE SARA SHERMAN

60
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:29,238
IS PEEKING IN THE WINDOW
TRYING TO WATCH THE SKIT.

61
00:03:29,238 --> 00:03:33,777
>> NOW SHE REALIZES SHE'S CAUGHT
AND TRIES TO MAKE A SMOOTH EXIT.

62
00:03:33,777 --> 00:03:38,622
WOW.
THEY'RE ALL PROFESSIONALS, BUT
SO ARE THE NEW YORK JETS.

63
00:03:38,701 --> 00:03:41,647
>> THE SHOWS HAVE REBUILDING FOR
SURE.

64
00:03:41,647 --> 00:03:43,909
LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE STATS
SO FAR.

65
00:03:44,017 --> 00:03:46,529
14 ATTEMPTED JOKES THIS EPISODE.

66
00:03:46,529 --> 00:03:49,344
ONLY ONE MILD LAUGH AND THREE
CHUCKLES.

67
00:03:49,344 --> 00:03:54,020
>> I HEARD THEY STAY UP UNTIL
5:00 A.M. WRITING THE SHOW.

68
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:57,396
>> WHEN DO THEY START WRITING
THE SHOW?
4:30

69
00:03:58,528 --> 00:04:03,423
THANK GOD THEY'VE GOT KENDRICK
LAMAR BECAUSE THAT'S THE ONLY
REASON ANYONE IS TUNING IN.

70
00:04:03,423 --> 00:04:06,334
>> LET'S CHECK BACK IN ON THE
SKIT.

71
00:04:06,334 --> 00:04:10,559
>> NOW, PRESIDENT XI, YOU'RE NOT
HELPING OUT VLADIMIR PUTIN, ARE
YOU?

72
00:04:10,559 --> 00:04:15,190
BECAUSE AS BRANDY TOLD MONICA,
THE BOY IS MINE.

73
00:04:15,502 --> 00:04:19,655
>> IT IS WHAT IT IS, AM I RIGHT?

74
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,628
IT IS WHAT IT IS.

75
00:04:21,628 --> 00:04:25,476
>> WAIT.
IS HE TRYING TO MAKE THAT A
CATCH PHRASE?

76
00:04:25,563 --> 00:04:27,507
IT IS WHAT IT IS.

77
00:04:27,507 --> 00:04:29,552
>> OH, GOD, LOOK, HE'S SAYING IT
TO CAMERA NOW.

78
00:04:29,552 --> 00:04:31,919
>> IT IS WHAT IT IS.

79
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:34,727
>> DESPERATE STUFF.

80
00:04:34,727 --> 00:04:38,745
ANYWAY, JOINING US NOW IS THE
THREE-TIME HOST OF SNL

81
00:04:38,745 --> 00:04:41,241
DURING
WHAT NOW SEEMS LIKE A GOLDEN
ERA.

82
00:04:41,241 --> 00:04:43,173
JOHN HAMM.

83
00:04:49,895 --> 00:04:52,734
JOHN, WHAT HAVE YOU SEEN SO FAR
TONIGHT?

84
00:04:52,789 --> 00:04:55,571
>> I DON'T KNOW, BUT IT'S NOT
COMEDY.

85
00:04:55,571 --> 00:04:57,958
THEY HAVEN'T EVEN USED KEY
UNANIMOUS YET.

86
00:04:57,958 --> 00:05:00,978
THAT'S LIKE PUTTING A WHOLE TEAM
OF ELIS ON THE FIELD,

87
00:05:00,978 --> 00:05:03,066
AND YOU'VE
GOT THE PEYTON SITTING ON THE
SIDELINES.

88
00:05:03,066 --> 00:05:05,502
>> I AGREE.

89
00:05:05,502 --> 00:05:08,198
>> WHAT ABOUT THE NEW CATS?
ANYONE YOU'RE EXCITED ABOUT?

90
00:05:08,198 --> 00:05:11,386
>> I HAVE BEEN SCOUTING DEVON
WALKER AT BAR SHOWS FOR YEARS
NOW.

91
00:05:11,386 --> 00:05:13,070
KID

92
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:15,265
COMES

93
00:05:15,265 --> 00:05:18,766
>> SIR, THAT CORN KID IS HERE TO
SEE YOU.

94
00:05:21,856 --> 00:05:24,937
>> IT'S CORN.
IT'S GOT THE JUICE.

95
00:05:24,937 --> 00:05:28,150
>> OH, HELL NO.
CORN KID?

96
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:31,892
DEVON WALKER'S FIRST APPEARANCE
ON NATIONAL TV,

97
00:05:31,892 --> 00:05:34,334
AND THEY GOT HIM
DOING CORN KID?

98
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:35,512
HEY

99
00:05:35,512 --> 00:05:40,372
>> IT COULD BE WORSE.
LOOKS LIKE THEY GOT MOLLY AND
MARCELLO DOING THE GRITTY.

100
00:05:40,373 --> 00:05:43,815
ATTEMP

101
00:05:43,815 --> 00:05:50,115
MAYBE THIS IS STRATEGIC LIKE
WHEN A SPORTS TEAM TANKS TO GET
A BETTER DRAFT PICK NEXT YEAR.

102
00:05:50,115 --> 00:05:54,785
>> AND SIR, THE SPECIAL MASTER
IS HERE.

103
00:05:54,785 --> 00:05:57,521
HE FINISHED REVIEWING YOUR
DOCUMENTS.

104
00:05:57,521 --> 00:06:01,957
>> I'VE DECIDED, THEY'RE ALL
AWESOME.

105
00:06:02,314 --> 00:06:08,125
SEAN WHITE?
that is just gratuitous stunt casting

106
00:06:11,884 --> 00:06:15,802
WELL, YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES THEY
NEED TO BRING IN A REAL
CELEBRITY

107
00:06:15,802 --> 00:06:18,367
WHEN THE HOST ISN'T
THAT FAMOUS.

108
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:20,750
>> RIGHT.

109
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:24,667
>> I MEAN, THEY COULDN'T GET THE
STAR OF THE SUMMER MOVIE

110
00:06:24,667 --> 00:06:29,137
OR TOM
CRUISE OR JOHN HAMM, THEY HAD TO
GET THE COSTAR.

111
00:06:29,225 --> 00:06:33,286
>> WELL, I HEARD THEY RARELY PUT
THE HOSTS IN COLD OPEN,

112
00:06:33,286 --> 00:06:36,487
SO WHEN
THEY DO, IT IS SPECIAL.

113
00:06:45,115 --> 00:06:47,489
>> SPECIAL OR SIT DESPERATE?

114
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:51,117
>> ALL RIGHT.
THANKS FOR STOPPING BY, JOHN.
I KNOW JOHN'S GOT TO GET OUT OF
HERE.

115
00:06:51,117 --> 00:06:54,272
>> NO.
I'M GOING TO STICK AROUND AND
SEE WHAT THE HELL THIS SHOW IS
GOING TO BE.

116
00:06:54,272 --> 00:06:59,388
>> AND LIVE FROM NEW YORK, IT'S
SATURDAY NIGHT!

117
00:09:01,311 --> 00:09:06,212
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, MILES
TELLER.

118
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:25,908
>>> THANK YOU.
THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU
VERY MUCH.

119
00:09:25,908 --> 00:09:31,316
I AM SO EXCITED TO BE HERE
HOSTING THE SEASON PREMIER OF
SNL.

120
00:09:32,547 --> 00:09:35,619
THIS IS MY FIRST TIME HOSTING,

121
00:09:35,619 --> 00:09:39,819
AND I KNOW THEY LIKE WHEN YOU DO
IMPRESSIONS, AND PLAY DIFFERENT CELEBRITIES,

122
00:09:39,819 --> 00:09:41,367
AND I WANTED TO
COME PREPARED.

123
00:09:41,438 --> 00:09:44,511
SO I ASKED MY FRIENDS, WHAT
CELEBRITY DO I LOOK LIKE,

124
00:09:44,511 --> 00:09:47,985
AND I
WAS THINKING A YOUNG DENIRO,
MAYBE A PAUL NEW MAN,

125
00:09:47,985 --> 00:09:51,211
AND THEY
WERE LIKE, NOPE, RACHEL MADAU.

126
00:09:51,994 --> 00:09:56,989
I DIDN'T SEE IT, BUT ONE OF THEM
SENT ME THIS.

127
00:10:01,496 --> 00:10:06,056
THIS YEAR, I WAS IN A MOVIE
CALLED "TOP GUN, MAVERICK",

128
00:10:08,319 --> 00:10:11,989
AND
ONE OF THE THINGS I LOVED ABOUT THE MOVIE

129
00:10:11,989 --> 00:10:14,159
IS IT REALLY SEEMED TO
BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER.

130
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:16,190
IT'S NOT EVERY DAY YOU GET A MOVIE

131
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:20,446
THAT'S LOVED BOTH BY THE
MILITARY COMMUNITY AND THE GAY
COMMUNITY.

132
00:10:20,446 --> 00:10:22,980
THAT WORKED OUT.

133
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:26,173
IT WAS ALSO AMAZING GETTING TO
WORK WITH TOM CRUISE.

134
00:10:26,173 --> 00:10:27,988
THAT GUY IS LEGEND.

135
00:10:28,077 --> 00:10:31,958
WE BOTH PUSHING OURSELVES TO THE
ABSOLUTE LIMIT FOR THIS MOVIE.

136
00:10:31,958 --> 00:10:34,938
HE DID HIS OWN STUNTS, AND I

137
00:10:34,938 --> 00:10:37,593
GREW MY OWN MUSTACHE.

138
00:10:37,593 --> 00:10:42,055
IN THE MOVIE, THERE'S A SCENE
WHERE MY CHARACTER ROOSTER

139
00:10:42,055 --> 00:10:44,868
SINGS
AND PLAYS GREAT BALLS OF FIRE ON
THE PIANO.

140
00:10:44,869 --> 00:10:48,156
PLAY

141
00:10:48,156 --> 00:10:50,363
I TOLD THEM, I DON'T NEED A
DOUBLE, GUYS.

142
00:10:50,363 --> 00:10:52,946
I'LL DO IT MYSELF, I'LL DO IT
LIVE.

143
00:10:52,946 --> 00:10:55,767
SO I LEARNED THIS SONG, A
PRACTICED IT A BUNCH.

144
00:10:55,767 --> 00:11:00,953
I EVEN TOOK PIANO LESSONS.
MY INSTRUCTOR WAS JK SIMMONS,

145
00:11:02,139 --> 00:11:05,910
WHO WAS SURPRISINGLY NICE.

146
00:11:05,969 --> 00:11:10,136
AND ON SET, I PLAYED THE ENTIRE
SONG, BEGINNING TO END,

147
00:11:10,136 --> 00:11:14,515
AND THEN
WHEN I SAW THE MOVIE, THIS IS
WHAT THEY ENDED UP USING.

148
00:11:33,064 --> 00:11:36,534
I GOT TO SAY, I'M SO HONORED TO
BE HERE.

149
00:11:36,534 --> 00:11:40,059
GROWING UP, ME AND MY FAMILY
WOULD WATCH "SNL" EVERY WEEK,

150
00:11:40,059 --> 00:11:43,427
AND MY SISTERS AND I WOULD
REENACT SOME OF THE SKETCHES,

151
00:11:43,427 --> 00:11:45,651
AND MY MOM WOULD VIDEO TAPE
THEM.

152
00:11:45,651 --> 00:11:48,615
ONE OF OUR FAVORITES WAS THE
SPAR TAN CHEERLEADERS.

153
00:11:48,616 --> 00:11:51,790
FERRELL

154
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:54,382
I PLAYED SHERRY OTERRY

155
00:11:54,382 --> 00:11:57,501
BECAUSE I WAS EIGHT AND I HAD THE FRAME
FOR IT.

156
00:11:57,501 --> 00:12:01,012
NOW, I THOUGHT THAT VIDEO WAS
LOST.

157
00:12:01,012 --> 00:12:05,315
BUT MY MOM FOUND IT, AND SHE'S
HERE TONIGHT,

158
00:12:05,315 --> 00:12:07,647
AND SHE BROUGHT
IT.
HERE IT IS.

159
00:12:09,473 --> 00:12:11,942
THAT'S ME IN THE TANK TOP.

160
00:12:11,942 --> 00:12:14,525
MY SISTER ERIN IS PLAYING WILL
FERRELL.

161
00:12:14,565 --> 00:12:16,839
OH, YEAH.

162
00:12:17,424 --> 00:12:21,372
AND IF YOU LOOK IN THE
BACKGROUND, THAT'S MY OTHER
SISTER, DANA.

163
00:12:21,372 --> 00:12:24,566
PRETTY SURE SHE'S PLAYING LAUREN
MICHAELS.

164
00:12:25,222 --> 00:12:28,894
AND THEN WE FINISH OUR ROUTINE
WITH THE CLASSIC,

165
00:12:28,894 --> 00:12:30,703
WHO'S THAT
SPARTAN IN MY TP.

166
00:12:30,769 --> 00:12:34,171
>> WHO'S THAT SPARTAN IN MY TP?

167
00:12:34,171 --> 00:12:36,030
>> IT'S ME, IT'S ME.

168
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:38,222
>> WHO'S THAT SPARTAN IN MY TP?

169
00:12:38,222 --> 00:12:41,160
>> IT'S ME, IT'S ME.

170
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:51,951
NAILED IT.

171
00:12:51,952 --> 00:12:54,193
BUT SERIOUSLY, HOW CRAZY IS
THAT?

172
00:12:54,263 --> 00:12:57,247
MY PARENTS USED TO WATCH ME DO
SKITS IN MY LIVING ROOM,

173
00:12:57,247 --> 00:13:02,123
AND NOW
THEY'RE HERE WATCHING ME HOST
SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE.

174
00:13:03,872 --> 00:13:08,412
WE'VE GOT A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU
TONIGHT.

175
00:13:08,412 --> 00:13:11,574
STICK

176
00:13:30,578 --> 00:13:33,976
>>> IT'S TIME TO PLAY AMERICA'S
EASIEST GAME SHOW,

177
00:13:33,976 --> 00:13:36,716
SEND
SOMETHING NORMAL.

178
00:13:37,629 --> 00:13:41,495
>> ALL RIGHT, AMERICA.
WELCOME TO SEND SOMETHING
NORMAL.

179
00:13:41,495 --> 00:13:43,225
I'M YOUR HOST, HALEN HARDY.

180
00:13:43,225 --> 00:13:46,700
THE GAME IS VERY SIMPLE.

181
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,819
WE HAVE FOUR MALE CELEBRITY CONTESTANTS,

182
00:13:48,819 --> 00:13:53,221
AND ALL THEY HAVE

ON INSTAGRAM

183
00:13:53,221 --> 00:13:55,987
IN A WAY THAT IS
NORMAL.

184
00:13:55,987 --> 00:13:59,395
AND FELLOWS, IF YOU SEND A NORMAL DM,

185
00:13:59,395 --> 00:14:03,033

186
00:14:03,033 --> 00:14:07,423
AGAIN, THE GAME IS SEND A WOMAN
A NORMAL DM

187
00:14:07,423 --> 00:14:11,024
AND YOU WIN
$100 MILLION.

188
00:14:11,024 --> 00:14:15,684
NOW, LET'S MEET OUR FIRST
CONTESTANT, ADAM LEVINE.

189
00:14:17,739 --> 00:14:20,722
NOW, WE ALL KNOW WHY YOU'RE
HERE, ADAM.

190
00:14:20,722 --> 00:14:24,966
>> I WAS BAD.

191
00:14:24,966 --> 00:14:26,612

>> YEAH, HI.

195
00:14:34,242 --> 00:14:38,138
CAN I GET A BIG WELCOME BACK TO
HOLLYWOOD ROUND OF APPLAUSE?

196
00:14:38,138 --> 00:14:39,946
>> NO, YOU MAY NOT.

197
00:14:39,946 --> 00:14:43,027
NEXT UP, NEIL DEGRASS TYSON.

198
00:14:43,027 --> 00:14:46,757
>> WELL, THANK YOU FOR HAVING

199
00:14:46,757 --> 00:14:48,176
WHY AM I HERE?

200
00:14:48,176 --> 00:14:52,967
>> WELL, NEIL, YOU HAVEN'T HAD A
DM SCANDAL YET, BUT YOU NEVER
KNOW.

201
00:14:52,967 --> 00:14:57,884
>> OH, PLEASE, IN MY CIRCLE, DM
STANDS, DIVALENT MAGNESIUM.

202
00:14:59,754 --> 00:15:06,532
BUT I SUPPOSE IN OUR ALTERNATE
REALITIES, ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE.

203
00:15:06,532 --> 00:15:11,641

00:15:17,763 --> 00:15:21,727
LAST WEEK, WE RACKED OVER
$1.4 BILLION.

207
00:15:21,727 --> 00:15:25,070
BOWEN, WHAT DO YOU ATTRIBUTE YOUR
SUCCESS TO?

208
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:29,093
>> OH, BEING GAY.

209
00:15:29,093 --> 00:15:31,237
>> MAKES SENSE TO ME.

210
00:15:31,237 --> 00:15:35,908
ALL RIGHT.
ADAM LEVINE, HOW ARE YOU GOING
