1
00:00:07,005 --> 00:00:11,955
>>> HELLO, AND WELCOME BACK TO
THE OSCARS RED CARPET PRESHOW.

2
00:00:11,955 --> 00:00:14,316
>> I'M THE MAN INSIDE YOUR HOTEL TV

3
00:00:14,316 --> 00:00:17,341
WHO TELLS YOU WHAT THE MOVIES
ARE, MARIO LOPEZ.

4
00:00:17,341 --> 00:00:20,800
>> AND I'M EITHER MARIA MENOUNOS
OR KIT HOOVER.

5
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,829
THEY HAVEN'T TOLD ME YET.

6
00:00:22,829 --> 00:00:26,285
>> AND YOU'RE ABOUT TO WATCH THE
95th ANNUAL ACADEMY AWARDS

7
00:00:26,285 --> 00:00:28,923
SPONSORED BY OZEMPIC.

8
00:00:28,923 --> 00:00:33,919
>> "OZEMPIC". I GUESS EVERYONE IN HOLLYWOOD
HAS DIABETES.

9
00:00:33,919 --> 00:00:37,913
>> AND WE'RE SO EXCITED TO HAVE
BEEN STANDING OUTSIDE THE DOLBY THEATE

10
00:00:37,913 --> 00:00:40,375
FOR ALM 153 HOURS.

11
00:00:40,375 --> 00:00:42,805
>> WE HAVE NOT SLEPT OR USED THE
BATHROOM.

12
00:00:42,805 --> 00:00:47,812
OUR ONLY FOOD IS A HANDFUL OF
SARDINES THEY THROW AT US.
SEALS IN ZOO

13
00:00:47,812 --> 00:00:52,081
>> BUT IT'S ALL WORTH IT TO ASK
ANGELA BASSETT IF SHE REALLY DID
THE THING.

14
00:00:52,081 --> 00:00:54,380
>> OOPS. WE ALMOST FORGOT,

15
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:58,182
EVERY 30
SECONDS, WE HAVE TO DO A FEW
AWKWARD PAN-DOWNS TO WOMEN'S
FEET.

16
00:00:58,265 --> 00:00:59,632
HERE WE GO.

17
00:01:06,268 --> 00:01:09,222
>> EVERYONE NEEDED TO SEE THAT.

18
00:01:09,222 --> 00:01:13,102
>> NOW LAST YEAR'S OSCARS HAD
THE SLAP, WHICH IS AWESOME --

19
00:01:13,102 --> 00:01:14,774
I
MEAN BAD, SO BAD.

20
00:01:14,774 --> 00:01:17,058
>> WE HATED ALL THE ATTENTION.

21
00:01:17,058 --> 00:01:20,558
>> SO THIS YEAR, TO MAKE SURE
NOTHING CRAZY HAPPENS,

22
00:01:20,558 --> 00:01:23,299
THE
ACADEMY HIRED A NEW HEAD OF SECURITY

23
00:01:23,299 --> 00:01:27,533
NOTORIOUSLY CALM AND
SANE PERSON, MIKE TYSON.

24
00:01:27,533 --> 00:01:30,332
>> THANK YOU.
MY GOODNESS.

25
00:01:30,332 --> 00:01:32,937
OH, WOW.
THANK YOU.

26
00:01:34,218 --> 00:01:37,767
OH, MY GOODNESS.
THAT'S SO NICE OF Y'ALL.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

27
00:01:37,767 --> 00:01:42,166
I AM READY TO HANDLE THE
PROCEEDINGS JUDICIOUSLY AND EXPO
DISHSLY.

28
00:01:42,166 --> 00:01:45,285
THE FOLLOWING THINGS WILL SET MF

29
00:01:45,285 --> 00:01:48,893
CLAPPING, STATUES OF

30
00:01:48,893 --> 00:01:51,387
PE THAT LAST MORE THAN TWO HOURS,

31
00:01:51,387 --> 00:01:54,875
AND ALSO HEARING
THE PH, THE MAGIC OF MOVIES.

32
00:01:54,875 --> 00:01:58,244
>> ARE THERE ANY NEW SECURITY
MEASURES IN PLACE?

33
00:01:58,244 --> 00:02:01,188
>> THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION.

34
00:02:01,188 --> 00:02:06,727
THIS YEAR, ALL THE NOMINEES HAVE
BEEN GIVEN TASERS.

35
00:02:06,727 --> 00:02:09,685
ALL THE SEAT FLE HAVE BEEN GIVEN GUNS,

36
00:02:09,685 --> 00:02:13,541
KIMMEL HAS
GIVEN A FLAME THROWER.

37
00:02:13,541 --> 00:02:15,542
>> AND NOT THAT WE'RE HOPING FOR THIS,

38
00:02:15,542 --> 00:02:19,283
BUT ARE YOU WORRIED WILL
SMITH IS PLANNING A SECOND
ATTACK?

39
00:02:19,283 --> 00:02:21,729
>> YES.
WE ARE PLANNING THAT THREAT VERY
SERIOUSLY.

40
00:02:21,729 --> 00:02:26,836
LUCKILY, WE WERE ABLE TO SLIP
ONE OF THOSE APPLE AIR TAGS INTO
WILL SMITH'S POCKET.

41
00:02:26,836 --> 00:02:29,660
SO WE KNOW EXACTLY WHERE HE WILL BE AT ALL TIMES

42
00:02:29,741 --> 00:02:32,933
UNLESS HE
CHANGES HIS PANTS.

43
00:02:32,933 --> 00:02:35,903
STAY FROSTY, EVERYBODY.

44
00:02:35,903 --> 00:02:38,415
>> UH-OH, I'M LEGIT SCARED.

45
00:02:38,415 --> 00:02:43,318
>> AND NOW, OF COURSE, THE SHOW
HAS FACED A LOT OF COMPLAINTS
ABOUT A LACK OF DIVERSITY.

46
00:02:43,318 --> 00:02:46,591
BUT REMEMBER, OSCAR TURNS 95
THIS YEAR.

47
00:02:46,591 --> 00:02:51,388
>> SO IF YOU THINK ABOUT HOW
RACIST AND SEXIST YOUR GRANDPA WAS AT 95,

48
00:02:51,388 --> 00:02:55,080
OSCAR'S LOOKING
PRETTY DARN GOOD.

49
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:58,688
>> SPEAKING OF LOOKING GOOD,

50
00:02:58,688 --> 00:03:03,178
IT'S FIRST TIME NOMINEE FOR BEST
SUPPORTING ACTRESS, JAMIE LEE
CURTIS.

51
00:03:04,337 --> 00:03:09,115

IS THIS?

52
00:03:09,115 --> 00:03:11,999
I SOLD YOGURT THAT MADE YOU POOP,

53
00:03:12,067 --> 00:03:15,752
AND NOW I'M NOMINATED!

54
00:03:17,646 --> 00:03:22,238
>> NOW, YOU HAVE BEEN
REFRESHINGLY DOWN TO EARTH THIS
WHOLE AWARDS SEASON.

55
00:03:22,238 --> 00:03:23,813
WHO ARE YOU WEARING TONIGHT?

56
00:03:23,813 --> 00:03:26,745
>> KIRKLAND BY COSTCO.

57
00:03:27,438 --> 00:03:32,156
>> JAMIE, YOU'VE ALSO BEEN SO
VOCALLY SUPPORTIVE OF ALL YOUR
FELLOW NOMINEES.

58
00:03:32,156 --> 00:03:35,334
>> WELL, BECAUSE THESE ACTRESSES
RULE!

59
00:03:35,334 --> 00:03:38,295
CATE BLANCHETT, ARE YOU KIDDING
ME?

60
00:03:38,295 --> 00:03:40,513
SHE IS SO -- AM I ALLOWED TO
CURSE?

61
00:03:40,513 --> 00:03:44,265
>> NO.
>> SHE IS SO -- HOT.

62
00:03:44,265 --> 00:03:47,046
AND TAR, OH, MY GOD,

63
00:03:47,046 --> 00:03:52,528
TAR WAS ICONIC, VIVACIOUS,
CARN

64
00:03:52,528 --> 00:03:59,169
QUEER, VAGUE,
CONFUSING, LONG,

65
00:03:59,169 --> 00:04:01,252
PARTIALLY IN GERMAN,

66
00:04:01,252 --> 00:04:05,835
AND IT WAS HANDS DOWN
THE FUNNIEST MOVIE OF THE YEAR.

67
00:04:05,925 --> 00:04:09,705
AND CAN I SAY ONE MORE THING IN.
>> I THINK YOU'RE GONNA.

68
00:04:09,705 --> 00:04:13,920
>> WHAT ARIANA DeBOSE DID AT THE
BAFTAS WAS FUN.

69
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:18,227
IT WAS BY FAR THE BEST RAP
PERFORMANCE I'VE SEEN ALL YEAR.

70
00:04:18,227 --> 00:04:21,241
IT WAS INCREDIBLE.

71
00:04:21,241 --> 00:04:23,655
>> WELL, GOOD LUCK, AND HAVE FUN
TONIGHT.

72
00:04:23,655 --> 00:04:25,208
>> OH, NO.
I'M ON MY WAY HOME.

73
00:04:25,208 --> 00:04:28,525
IT'S WAY PAST MOMMY'S BEDTIME.

74
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,707
>> OH, I JUST LOVE HER.

75
00:04:32,707 --> 00:04:37,456
NOW, ONE GROUP THAT DOESN'T
TRADITIONALLY WATCH THE OSCARS
ARE DEGENERATE GAMBLERS,

76
00:04:37,456 --> 00:04:40,185
AND
THAT'S WHY THIS YEAR, WE'RE
PARTNERING WITH DRAFTKINGS

77
00:04:40,185 --> 00:04:44,269
TO OFFER
WHAT'S THE LATEST UPDATE,
FELLAS?

78
00:04:44,269 --> 00:04:47,838
>> WELL, HERE ARE SOME OF THE
LATEST BETTING LINES.

79
00:04:47,838 --> 00:04:52,517
THREE TO ONE ODDS THAT A YOUNG
ACTOR BRINGS OUT AN OLD ACTOR IN A WHEELCHAIR

80
00:04:52,517 --> 00:04:54,281
AND REGRETS IT
IMMEDIATELY.

81
00:04:54,281 --> 00:04:57,860
>> AND TWO TO ONE THAT SOMEONE

82
00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:00,365
ALL

83
00:05:00,365 --> 00:05:05,728
TEN TO ONE
IN THE END MEMORIAM IS STILL
ALIVE.

84
00:05:05,728 --> 00:05:09,977
>> WE'RE ALSO SEEING A LOT OF
MOVEMENT IN THE WHO'S GOING TO
MAKE A SURPRISE APPEARANCE POLL.

85
00:05:10,041 --> 00:05:13,289
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
SOME OF THE FAVORITE LONG SHOT
PICK SOS FAR ARE

86
00:05:13,289 --> 00:05:17,174
CHRIS ROCK,
JARED FROM SUBWAY,

AND HARVEY WEINSTEIN INTRODUCES
KANYE WEST.

90
00:05:31,358 --> 00:05:34,681
>> WOW.
A GIRL CAN DREAM.

91
00:05:34,681 --> 00:05:39,704
BUT HOLD THAT THOUGHT BECAUSE
I'M TOLD WE HAVE THE STARS OF THE BANSHEES

92
00:05:39,704 --> 00:05:42,981
COLIN FARRELLND
BRENDAN DEGREESON.

93
00:05:45,224 --> 00:05:47,599
HOW DO YOU GUYS LIKE YOUR
CHANCES TONIGHT?

94
00:05:47,599 --> 00:06:11,224
>> YOU KNOW, WORDS FOR TROOPS IN
THE BAY.
GREEN

95
00:06:11,224 --> 00:06:14,579
>> WOW.

DRINKING YET.

96
00:06:14,579 --> 00:06:19,909
>> AND THIS IS SO EXCITING.
I'M BEING TOLD WE HAVE MICHELLE
WILLIAMS.

97
00:06:19,909 --> 00:06:24,451
>> CLOSE.

ACTING COACH FOR THE FABLEMANS.

98
00:06:24,451 --> 00:06:27,500
>> HELLO.
IT'S WONDERFUL TO BE HERE

99
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:32,016
EVEN
THOUGH MY HAIR IS -- BUT, I'M
HERE.

100
00:06:32,016 --> 00:06:34,985
>> SO WAS THE FABLEMAN'S YOUR
FIRST HOLLYWOOD PROJECT?

101
00:06:34,985 --> 00:06:39,020
>> OH, SWEETIE, NO.

I BELIEVE WE HAVE A PHOTO.

105
00:06:51,434 --> 00:06:55,194
>> AND HOW DID YOU THINK THAT
MICHELLE'S PERFORMANCE TURNED
OUT?

106
00:06:55,194 --> 00:06:58,073
>> OH, SHE WAS AMAZING.

107
00:06:58,073 --> 00:07:02,680
AND IF I CLOSE MY EYES AND EARS,
I THINK SHE IS JEWISH.

108
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:08,003
NOW, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME, I HAVE

117
00:07:39,771 --> 00:07:42,357
>> GEORGE, YOU'RE NOT FOOLING
ANYONE.

118
00:07:42,357 --> 00:07:45,971
>> YEAH.
EXCEPT I DID, AND NOW I'M IN
CONGRESS.

119
00:07:45,971 --> 00:07:51,049

KIDS.

124
00:08:06,923 --> 00:08:11,014

SATURDAY NIGHT!

125
00:10:13,257 --> 00:10:17,875
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, JENNA
ORTEGA!

126
00:10:37,264 --> 00:10:40,412
THANK

127
00:10:40,412 --> 00:10:42,681
I AM SO EXCITED TO BE HERE.

128
00:10:42,762 --> 00:10:44,291
MY NAME IS JENNA ORTEGA.

129
00:10:44,291 --> 00:10:47,658
I'M 20 YEARS OLD, WHICH MAKES ME
THE YOUNGEST HOST THIS SEASON.

130
00:10:47,658 --> 00:10:50,131
I ACTUALLY HAVE BEEN ACTING SINCE I WAS SEVEN

131
00:10:50,214 --> 00:10:53,220
WHEN MY MOM
PUT ME ON FACEBOOK.

132
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:57,702
TIKTOK

133
00:10:58,078 --> 00:11:01,020
CRAZY

134
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:04,544
I WAS IN "WEDNESDAY ", "X" AND NOW

135
00:11:04,718 --> 00:11:07,007
"SCREAM 6."

136
00:11:07,007 --> 00:11:11,359
A LOT OF PEOPLE ASSUME I AM DARK
AND TWISTED BECAUSE OF THESE
ROLES I PLAY.

137
00:11:11,359 --> 00:11:12,792
I'M NOT LIKE THAT AT ALL.

138
00:11:12,792 --> 00:11:16,037
I THINK THERE'S JUST SOMETHING
ABOUT MY FACE WHEN PEOPLE SEE IT,  THEY'RE LIKE

139
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:19,544
LET'S THROW
BLOOD ON THAT.

140
00:11:19,544 --> 00:11:21,965
BUT I WASN'T ALWAYS IN HORROR
FILMS.

141
00:11:21,965 --> 00:11:26,423
MY FIRST ACTING ROLE WAS IN A
COLGATE TOOTH PASTE COMMERCIAL
WHEN I WAS NINE.

142
00:11:26,423 --> 00:11:27,870
TAKE A LOOK

143
00:11:28,169 --> 00:11:31,505
>> WANT TO CATCH THOSE LITTLE NASTIES,

144
00:11:31,505 --> 00:11:35,141
YOU KNOW THOSE LITTLE
GERMS THAT HIDE IN YOUR MOUTH?

145
00:11:36,624 --> 00:11:40,856
I'LL BE BACK TONIGHT, INVISIBLE
NASTIES.

146
00:11:46,221 --> 00:11:50,670
>> I AM STILL THAT EXACT SAME
GIRL.
SAME ONE.

147
00:11:50,738 --> 00:11:56,145
IT'S JUST THAT SCARY MUSIC AND
EDITING CAN MAKE ANYTHING SEEM
LIKE A HORROR FILM.

148
00:11:56,145 --> 00:11:57,395
WATCH.

149
00:11:57,395 --> 00:12:01,673
>> WANT TO HELP ME CATCH AN
INVISIBLE GERM?

150
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:05,751
I'LL BE BACK TONIGHT, INVISIBLE
NASTIES.

151
00:12:05,751 --> 00:12:08,131
FALL 2023

152
00:12:12,285 --> 00:12:16,125
>> I LOVE HORROR MOVIES, BUT
HONESTLY, I DON'T GET SCARED
VERY EASILY.

153
00:12:16,125 --> 00:12:18,473
PART OF THE REASON I WANTED TO HOST SNL

154
00:12:18,473 --> 00:12:20,730
IS I WANTED TO FACE MY
BIGGEST FEAR.

155
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:24,787
HAPPY EXTROVERTED PEOPLE ALWAYS
TRYING TO PERFORM.

156
00:12:25,079 --> 00:12:30,105
EVERYONE HERE HAS BEEN SO KIND,
AND THIS WEEK HAS BEEN A DREAM
COME TRUE.

157
00:12:30,105 --> 00:12:32,025
I'VE GOT A COUPLE OF FRIENDS TONIGHT,

158
00:12:32,025 --> 00:12:35,887
INCLUDING ONE OF MY
COSTARS FROM "WEDNESDAY", FRED
ARMISON.

159
00:12:38,172 --> 00:12:39,567
HI

160
00:12:39,567 --> 00:12:42,390
>> DON'T LET ME DISTRACT YOU.
I'M JUST HERE TO WATCH

161
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:45,756
WITH
THESE PEOPLE THAT ARE BELOW ME.

162
00:12:46,258 --> 00:12:49,724
>> DID YOU WANT TO COME UP AND
JOIN ME ON STAGE?

163
00:12:49,724 --> 00:12:54,495
>> ME, GO UP THERE IN FRONT OF
THE CAMERAS?
I COULD NEVER.

164
00:12:54,495 --> 00:12:57,088
>> I'M SORRY.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO.

165
00:12:57,088 --> 00:12:59,200
>> FINE, I WILL.

166
00:13:03,921 --> 00:13:09,096
SO THIS IS WHAT IT FEELS LIKE TO
BE ON "SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE."

167
00:13:09,096 --> 00:13:11,839
>> YOU WERE ON THE SHOW FOR 11
SEASONS.

168
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:14,564
>> THAT'S SWEET.
THANK YOU.

169
00:13:14,851 --> 00:13:18,620
>> SERIOUSLY, FRED, I AM SO
HONORED THAT YOU'RE HERE.

170
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:21,177
YOU'RE THE REASON I STARTED
WATCHING SNL ACTUALLY.

171
00:13:21,177 --> 00:13:24,207
MY FAVORITE SKETCH OF ALL TIME
IS THE CALIFORNIANS.

172
00:13:26,312 --> 00:13:28,080
>> THANKS, JENNA.
THAT'S SO NICE.

173
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:31,692
YOU KNOW, THE ORIGINAL IDEA CAME
TO ME BECAUSE I WAS GIVING
DIRECTIONS --

174
00:13:31,692 --> 00:13:34,954
>> WE FIGURED IT WAS SOMETHING
LIKE THAT.

175
00:13:34,954 --> 00:13:38,383
IT'S ALL GOOD.
THANK YOU, FRED.

176
00:13:42,053 --> 00:13:45,301
LIKE I SAID, THIS FEELS LIKE A
DREAM.

177
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:49,396
WHEN I WAS A KID, I WASN'T OLD
ENOUGH TO WATCH SNL YET,

178
00:13:49,396 --> 00:13:53,018
SO I
TOOK A TOUR OF THE SNL STUDIO
WITH MY PARENTS LIKE SIX YEARS AGO,

179
00:13:53,018 --> 00:13:56,268
AND THEY SAID, MAN,
WOULDN'T IT BE AMAZING IF YOU
HOSTED SOME DAY,

180
00:13:56,268 --> 00:13:58,840
AND IT SEEMED
IMPOSSIBLE THEN,

181
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:02,017
BUT NOW I'M
HERE TONIGHT, AND MY PARENTS ARE
IN THE AUDIENCE,

182
00:14:02,017 --> 00:14:06,078
AND THEY GET TO
HEAR ME SAY WE HAVE A GREAT SHOW
FOR YOIG

183
00:14:06,078 --> 00:14:08,709
HERE

184
00:14:08,709 --> 00:14:11,847
STICK

185
00:14:35,892 --> 00:14:40,356
">>> WELCOME EVERYBODY TO SCHOOL
VERSUS SCHOOL

186
00:14:40,356 --> 00:14:43,658
WHERE TEACHERS
TEAM UP WITH THEIR STAR STUDENTS
TO WIN BIG BUCKS.

187
00:14:43,658 --> 00:14:45,297
I'M YOUR HOST JAY McCORMICK.

188
00:14:45,297 --> 00:14:48,956
AFTER
I WAS THE KEY WITNESS

189
00:14:48,956 --> 00:14:52,659
IN A HARASSMENT TRIAL OF THIS SHOW'S
COVID REPRESENTATIVE

190
00:14:52,659 --> 00:14:55,600
WHO SWABBED
MY ANUS IN LIEU OF MY NOSE

191
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,171
EVERY
DAY FOR FIVE MONTHS,

192
00:14:58,171 --> 00:15:02,903
BUT THAT'S
ALL IN THE PAST NOW, SO LET'S
MEET OUR TEAMS.

193
00:15:02,903 --> 00:15:05,633
FROM WEST GROVE HIGH IN NEW JERSEY,

194
00:15:05,633 --> 00:15:10,429
TEACHER SHEILA CASHMAN
AND HER STUDENTS GABE AND MANNY.

195
00:15:10,429 --> 00:15:15,232
I'M TOLD YOUR SCHOOL HAS ONE OF
THE BEST SCIENCE DEPARTMENTS IN
THE COUNTRY.

196
00:15:15,232 --> 00:15:19,413
>> YES, AND YOU CAN SAY IT'S A
PLUS.

197
00:15:20,309 --> 00:15:22,821
>> YEAH, THAT'S CUTE.

198
00:15:22,821 --> 00:15:24,999
NOW LET'S MEET THEIR OPPONENTS

199
00:15:24,999 --> 00:15:31,147
FROM PROFESSOR ZANDER'S ACADEMY
FOR EXTRAORDINARY CHILDREN,

200
00:15:31,147 --> 00:15:37,745
PROFESSOR CHANDLISS ZANDER AND
HIS STUDENTS ZENA AND KNOCKOUT.

201
00:15:37,961 --> 00:15:44,991
IT SAYS HERE THAT YOUR SCHOOL IS
A 100 ROOM VICTORIAN MANSION

202
00:15:44,991 --> 00:15:49,477
LOCATED WITHIN A 10,000 ACRE
PRIVATE FOREST.

203
00:15:49,477 --> 00:15:51,968
>> THAT IS CORRECT.

204
00:15:51,968 --> 00:15:55,727
WE NEED AMPLE SPACE IN WHICH TO
TRAIN OUR STUDENTS

205
00:15:55,727 --> 00:15:59,707
TO HARNESS
THEIR INCREDIBLE GIFTS.

206
00:15:59,802 --> 00:16:03,727
>> IF MY GIFTS ARE SO
INCREDIBLE, THEN WHY WON'T YOU
LET ME USE THEM?

207
00:16:03,727 --> 00:16:08,123
>> BECAUSE YOU CANNOT YET
CONTROL THEM, CHILD!

208
00:16:11,884 --> 00:16:14,209
>> OKEYDOKEY.

209
00:16:14,209 --> 00:16:17,626
LET'S JUST GET TO THE GAME.
ARE WE FEELING CONFIDENT TEAMS.

210
00:16:17,626 --> 00:16:21,924
>> HECK YEAH.
PROFESSOR ZANDER'S ACADEMY,
YOU'RE GOING DOWN.

211
00:16:21,924 --> 00:16:25,169
>> WE COULD ENSLAVE YOU!

212
00:16:25,169 --> 00:16:27,712
>> NO!

213
00:16:27,712 --> 00:16:29,806
>> WELL, THAT'S FUN.

214
00:16:29,806 --> 00:16:32,818
ALL RIGHT.
FIRST QUESTION GETS CONTROL OF
THE BOARD.

215
00:16:32,891 --> 00:16:36,963
NAME FOR A RANDOM MODIFICATION
OF DNA FROM PARENT TO OFFSPRING.

216
00:16:36,963 --> 00:16:39,318
ZENA.
>> MUTATION.

217
00:16:39,318 --> 00:16:40,473
>> CORRECT.

218
00:16:40,473 --> 00:16:46,145
>> OH, YES, MUTATION IS A TOPIC
IN WHICH WE ARE WELL-VERSED.

219
00:16:46,145 --> 00:16:48,128
>> IT'S WHY THEY HATE US.
>> ZENA.

220
00:16:48,128 --> 00:16:52,171
>> THEY THINK WE'RE FREAKS!
>> ENOUGH, CHILD!

221
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,133
>> ALL RIGHT.

222
00:16:56,133 --> 00:17:00,372
WELL, ZENA, YOU HAVE A CHANCE
FOR EXTRA CREDIT.

223
00:17:00,372 --> 00:17:02,560
THE SUBJECT IS ENGLISH LIT.

224
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,389
HOW'S YOUR SCHOOL'S ENGLISH
DEPARTMENT?

225
00:17:04,463 --> 00:17:09,531
>> OUR CURRICULUM FOCUSES MORE
ON HARNESSING OUR STUDENTS'
ABILITIES.

226
00:17:09,531 --> 00:17:11,409
>> YOU ALWAYS DOUBT ME.

227
00:17:11,409 --> 00:17:13,662
ASK YOUR QUESTION.

228
00:17:13,662 --> 00:17:16,002
>> OKAY THEN.

229
00:17:16,002 --> 00:17:21,004
TO BE OR NOT TO BE IS SPOKEN BY
WHICH SHAKESPEARIAN PROTAGONIST?

230
00:17:21,004 --> 00:17:23,163
>> TOBY.

231
00:17:23,163 --> 00:17:25,501
>> WRONG.

232
00:17:25,501 --> 00:17:27,729
>> I FAILED!

233
00:17:27,729 --> 00:17:31,488
IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE ALL
THINKING?
THE FREAK FAILED?

234
00:17:31,488 --> 00:17:34,611
>> NO, I PROMISE YOU, SWEETIE.
NO ONE IS THINKING THAT.

235
00:17:34,611 --> 00:17:37,198
>> OH, YOU LIE, YOU PATHETIC
HUMAN!

236
00:17:37,198 --> 00:17:40,499
>> ZENA, NO, YOU COULD KILL HER!

237
00:17:43,221 --> 00:17:46,203
>> HEY, ALL RIGHT.
HEY!

238
00:17:46,203 --> 00:17:49,294
NOW, I JUST GOT BLASTED AND HIT
IN THE FACE

239
00:17:49,381 --> 00:17:53,352
WITH WHAT I CAN ONLY
DESCRIBE AS ELECTRIC WIND.

240
00:17:54,506 --> 00:17:56,714
BUT SINCE NO POINTS WERE AWARDED,

241
00:17:56,714 --> 00:17:59,027
CONTROL NOW GOES OVER
TO WEST GROVE HIGH

242
00:17:59,027 --> 00:18:00,512
WHO ARE YET
TO GET ON THE BOARD.

243
00:18:00,512 --> 00:18:02,502
ALL RIGHT, WEST GROVE, HERE'S
YOUR QUESTION.

244
00:18:02,582 --> 00:18:06,279
NAME THE TRIANGLE WHICH HAS
THREE SIDES EQUAL OF LENGTH.

245
00:18:06,279 --> 00:18:10,125
>> I THINK THERE'S SOMETHING
WRONG WITH OUR TEACHER.

246
00:18:12,457 --> 00:18:15,138
>> OKAY.
NO POINTS THERE.

247
00:18:15,138 --> 00:18:18,117
CONTROL BACK TO PROVFESSOR
ZANDER'S SCHOO I GUESS.

248
00:18:18,118 --> 00:18:21,703
SIZE

249
00:18:21,703 --> 00:18:24,268
>> LET ME INTO YOUR MIND.

250
00:18:24,268 --> 00:18:26,183
>> I CAN FIGURE IT OUT ON MY
OWN!

251
00:18:26,183 --> 00:18:29,390
>> I'M TRYING TO HELP YOU, ZENA!
>> GET OUT OF MY HEAD!

252
00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:31,150
LET

253
00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:34,092
>> STOP FIGHTING!

254
00:18:39,354 --> 00:18:41,454
>> GET ON OUT OF HERE.

255
00:18:41,454 --> 00:18:45,859
WE WERE LOOKING FOR EQUAL
LATERAL TRIANGLE.

256
00:18:45,859 --> 00:18:50,447
>> I SHOULDN'T BE HERE!
I SHOULD BE ON THE TEAM USING MY
POWERS.

257
00:18:50,447 --> 00:18:53,826
>> YOU ARE NOT READY, CHILD!

258
00:18:53,826 --> 00:18:55,831
>> ALL RIGHT.
WE JUST GOING TO TAKE A BREAK,

259
00:18:55,831 --> 00:19:00,652
LET THINGS CALM DOWN AND SEE IF
WE CAN GET THAT LADY'S BRAIN
BACK ONLINE.

260
00:19:01,036 --> 00:19:04,779
THIS IS JAY McCORMICK REMINDING
YOU THAT COVID SWABS

261
00:19:04,779 --> 00:19:06,989
GO IN THE
NOSE AND NOT THE KEISTER.

262
00:19:06,989 --> 00:19:09,316
FOOL ME ONCE, SHAME ON YOU.

263
00:19:09,316 --> 00:19:13,854
FOOL ME EVERY DAY FOR FIVE
MONTHS, SHAME ON ME.

264
