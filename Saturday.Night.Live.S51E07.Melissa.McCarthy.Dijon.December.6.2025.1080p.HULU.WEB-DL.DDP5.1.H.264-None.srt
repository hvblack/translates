00:00:01,719 --> 00:00:03,446
>>> YOU'RE WATCHING C-SPAN.

2
00:00:03,446 --> 00:00:05,663
HEY, NETFLIX, WE'RE FOR SALE,
TOO.

3
00:00:05,663 --> 00:00:10,749
WE NOW GO TO THE PENTAGON FOR A
PRESS CONFERENCE WITH THE
SECRETARY OF DEFENSE.

4
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:16,687
>> LADIES AND GENTLEMEN OF THE PRESS,
AS YOU KNOW THERE HAVE BEEN CONCERNS

5
00:00:16,687 --> 00:00:20,223
ABOUT ONGOING
MILITARY ACTION OFF THE COAST OF
VENEZUELA.

6
00:00:20,223 --> 00:00:24,665
HERE TO ANSWER ALL YOUR
QUESTIONS IN A CALM,
NONAGGRESSIVE FASHION

7
00:00:24,665 --> 00:00:31,309

8
00:00:40,362 --> 00:00:41,997
>> YEAH!

9
00:00:41,997 --> 00:00:45,344
SHUT THE HELL UP, SHUT UP, CUT
THE MUSIC.

10
00:00:45,344 --> 00:00:46,993
WHAT?

11
00:00:46,993 --> 00:00:51,258
FIRST THINGS FIRST.
WHERE ARE THE FATTIES?

12
00:00:51,258 --> 00:00:54,099
YOU, OUT.

13
00:00:54,099 --> 00:00:56,897
>> WHAT?
I'M NOT EVEN FAT.

14
00:00:56,897 --> 00:01:00,697
>> BOO, REALLY?
YOU THINK YOU'RE HIDING UNDER
THAT BLAZER, PORKY?

15
00:01:00,697 --> 00:01:03,765
WHO DO YOU WRITE FOR, "THE
CHICAGO TROMBONE"?

16
00:01:03,765 --> 00:01:07,904
THAT'S WHAT THEY PLAY WHEN YOUR
FAT ASS WALKS AROUND.

17
00:01:07,904 --> 00:01:12,423
LISTEN UP.
AS YOU PROBABLY READ IN SOME GAY
NEWSPAPER,

18
00:01:12,423 --> 00:01:15,074
WE'RE NOW AT WAR WITH
VENEZUELA.

19
00:01:15,074 --> 00:01:18,775
OH, YOU NERDS ARE LIKE, WAIT,
WAS THERE AN OFFICIAL
DECLARATION OF WAR?

20
00:01:18,775 --> 00:01:20,363
YEAH, IT'S RIGHT HERE.

21
00:01:20,363 --> 00:01:23,799
SUPERFINGER, DANE COOK.

22
00:01:25,125 --> 00:01:27,741
YOU GOT QUESTIONS, FINE,

23
00:01:27,741 --> 00:01:31,723
PRETEND I'M A RANDOM FISHING BOAT AND
FIRE AWAY.

24
00:01:32,216 --> 00:01:37,304
>> OKAY.
IS THERE ANY TRUTH TO THE
ALLEGATIONS

25
00:01:37,304 --> 00:01:40,633
THAT AFTER AN
INITIAL STRIKE ON A DRUG
SMUGGLING BOAT,

26
00:01:40,633 --> 00:01:44,627
YOU ORDERED A
SECOND STRIKE TO KILL THE
SURVIVORS?

27
00:01:44,627 --> 00:01:47,856
>> UH, FIRST OF ALL, THAT KIND
OF CRUEL, HEARTLESS ACT

28
00:01:47,856 --> 00:01:51,366
HAS NO
PLACE IN "OPERATION KILL
EVERYBODY."

29
00:01:51,366 --> 00:01:54,422
SECOND, I WASN'T EVEN IN THE
ROOM WHEN IT HAPPENED, OKAY?

30
00:01:54,422 --> 00:01:58,890
I WAS SO JACKED UP AFTER THE
FIRST STRIKE, I HAD TO MAKE AN
EMERGENCY CALL TO MY SPONSOR --

31
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:02,413
SORRY, A GUY I MET IN AN ONUS IN MEETING --

32
00:02:02,413 --> 00:02:05,583
SO I DON'T DRINK
SOMETHING --
¶ THAT I LIKE

33
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:08,605
BUT I CAN'T HAVE BUT I WANT IT
BUT I NEED IT AND I WANT IT RIGHT NOW

34
00:02:08,722 --> 00:02:11,515
BUP BUP BUP IT'S
BOOZE ¶

35
00:02:13,224 --> 00:02:15,000
NEXT QUESTION?

36
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,738
>> YES, WHAT DID YOU SAY TO
SENATOR MARK KELLY,

37
00:02:17,738 --> 00:02:21,008
WHO SAID YOU
ACT LIKE A 12-YEAR-OLD PLAYING
ARMY?

38
00:02:21,008 --> 00:02:23,993
>> KELLY, THAT'S A GIRL'S NAME.

39
00:02:23,993 --> 00:02:27,099
WHAT'S HIS FIRST NAME, DRESS?

40
00:02:27,099 --> 00:02:30,769
>> NO.
IT'S MARK LIKE I SAID.

41
00:02:30,769 --> 00:02:33,497
>> OH, GET A HUSBAND.

42
00:02:33,497 --> 00:02:36,496
>> I'M TRYING!

43
00:02:36,496 --> 00:02:40,005
>> TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION, IF I
WAS JUST PLAYING ARMY,

44
00:02:40,005 --> 00:02:41,912
WOULD
THERE BE 80 DEAD FISHERMEN --

45
00:02:41,912 --> 00:02:45,124
NARCOTERRORISTS?
VENEZUELA RIGHT NOW?

46
00:02:45,124 --> 00:02:46,270
NEXT QUESTION.

47
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:49,167
>> YEAH, SO IS 80 THE OFFICIAL
DEATH TOLL?

48
00:02:49,167 --> 00:02:51,298
>> IS 80 THE OFFICIAL --

49
00:02:51,298 --> 00:02:54,838
NO, IT'S 6-7, 6-7.

50
00:02:54,838 --> 00:02:56,794
IDIOT.

51
00:02:56,794 --> 00:03:00,343
LET'S JUST SAY IF I HAD A DRINK
FOR EVERY VENEZUELAN WE'VE KILLED,

52
00:03:00,343 --> 00:03:03,149
I'D REALLY LIKE THAT
NUMBER OF DRINKS.

53
00:03:03,149 --> 00:03:07,348
ALL RIGHT, NEXT?
OH, MY GOD, IS THAT MATT GAETZ?

54
00:03:08,268 --> 00:03:11,622
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
IT'S ME, MATT GAETZ.

55
00:03:11,622 --> 00:03:14,016
I'M A REPORTER NOW.

56
00:03:14,016 --> 00:03:19,131
QUESTION.
YOU'RE ONLY KILLING PEOPLE WHO
ARE TRAFFICKING DRUGS, RIGHT?

57
00:03:19,131 --> 00:03:22,743
SO HYPOTHETICALLY, IF SOMEONE
WERE TRAFFICKING SOMETHING ELSE --

58
00:03:22,743 --> 00:03:25,125
THEY'D BE OKAY?

59
00:03:25,526 --> 00:03:29,123
>> WE'RE TARGETING DRUG
SMUGGLERS EXCLUSIVELY.

60
00:03:29,123 --> 00:03:32,948
>> DIGGY, NO FURTHER QUESTIONS,
YOUR HONOR.

61
00:03:32,948 --> 00:03:36,029
>> I HAVE A QUESTION.
>> OH, JESUS.

62
00:03:36,029 --> 00:03:38,714
YEAH, WILL & GRACE, GO.

63
00:03:38,714 --> 00:03:41,742
>> MY NAME IS ACTUALLY WILLIAM
GRACE.

64
00:03:41,742 --> 00:03:46,109
HOW DO YOU RESPOND TO THE
ALLEGATIONS THAT THE SO-CALLED
WAR ON SMUGGLERS

65
00:03:46,109 --> 00:03:48,300
IS A SMOKE
SCREEN FOR REGIME CHANGE?

66
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:52,363
>> OH, WHOA, WAY TO SOLVE THE
MYSTERY, SCOOB.

67
00:03:52,363 --> 00:03:55,699
OF COURSE THAT'S WHAT WE'RE
DOING AND IT ALWAYS WORKS.

68
00:03:55,699 --> 00:03:58,861
JUST LIKE IT DID IN GUATEMALA,
NICARAGUA,

69
00:03:58,861 --> 00:04:02,949
CUBA, BRAZIL,
BOLIVIA, PANAMA
¶ HAITI ELSALVADOR

70
00:04:02,949 --> 00:04:06,326
CHILI
HONDURAS PERU" ANIMANIACS!

71
00:04:07,334 --> 00:04:08,933
DONE

72
00:04:08,933 --> 00:04:11,651
NERDS

73
00:04:11,651 --> 00:04:15,127
>> SECRETARYING HE GET, SOME
PEOPLE ACCUSE YOU OF HAR CRIMES.

74
00:04:15,127 --> 00:04:17,436
EVEN THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN
DISTANCING HIMSELF FROM YOU.

75
00:04:17,436 --> 00:04:19,702
>> I HAVE A QUESTION FOR YOU,

76
00:04:19,702 --> 00:04:21,917
HAVE YOU EVER KISSED A GIRL?

77
00:04:21,917 --> 00:04:24,888
I'M GENUINELY ASKING.

78
00:04:24,888 --> 00:04:26,946
>> I HAVE A WIFE.

79
00:04:26,946 --> 00:04:31,323
>> OKAY, SEND HERMES WAY WHEN
SHE WANTS TO ACTUALLY FEEL
SOMETHING.

80
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:39,275
ANYWAY, TO ANSWER YOUR
QUESTION -- PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS
MY BACK 100%.

81
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:42,025
YOU WANT TO KNOW WHY?
UNLIKE YOU BETA CUCKS,

82
00:04:42,025 --> 00:04:46,845
HE'S A
HIGH-ENERGY ALPHA WHO TRUSTS ME
AND LISTENS TO ME NO MATTER WHAT,

83
00:04:46,845 --> 00:04:49,840
ISN'T THAT RIGHT, MR.
PRESIDENT?

84
00:04:56,444 --> 00:05:00,981
>> STOP, MAMDANI!

85
00:05:01,791 --> 00:05:05,745
YOU CAN FREEZE MY RENT ANY TIME.

86
00:05:07,208 --> 00:05:10,927
I WASN'T SLEEPING.
I'M VERY MUCH AWAKE.

87
00:05:10,927 --> 00:05:12,973
NOW SOMEONE QUICKLY TELL ME,

88
00:05:12,973 --> 00:05:17,718
WHERE AM I, WHO MY, AND WHAT
YEAR MIGHT IT BE?

89
00:05:17,718 --> 00:05:19,792
>> GOOD ONE, MR. PRESIDENT.

90
00:05:19,792 --> 00:05:23,095
EVERYTHING YOU DO THAT'S WEIRD,
IT'S A JOKE.

91
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:28,624
I WAS JUST TELLING EVERYONE THAT
I HAD YOUR FULL SUPPORT.

92
00:05:28,624 --> 00:05:30,555
>> ABSOLUTELY.
WE LOVE PETE.

93
00:05:30,555 --> 00:05:34,313
HE'S A GREAT GUY.
HE WAS JUST FOG OF WAR, RIGHT?

94
00:05:34,313 --> 00:05:37,452
FOG OF WAR.
IT'S A THING YOU ONLY SAY

95
00:05:37,452 --> 00:05:39,714
AFTER
DOING WAR CRIME.

96
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:41,974
RIGHT?
YOU NEVER HEAR A GENERAL GO,

97
00:05:41,974 --> 00:05:45,434
"EVERYTHING WENT ACCORDING TO
PLAN IN FOG OF WAR."

98
00:05:45,434 --> 00:05:48,317
IT'S LIKE WHEN YOU GO INTO THE
SAUNA AT EQUINOX

99
00:05:48,317 --> 00:05:51,465
AND SUDDENLY
YOU'RE DOING STUFF YOU NEVER DID
BEFORE.

100
00:05:51,465 --> 00:05:54,822
FOG OF WAR.
FOG OF WAR, WE LOVE IT.

101
00:05:54,822 --> 00:05:56,738
IT'S A GREAT NEW EXCUSE, WE LOVE
IT.

102
00:05:56,738 --> 00:06:00,014
SO I STAND BY PETE.
AND NOTHING CAN CHANGE MY MIND.

103
00:06:00,014 --> 00:06:02,241
UNLESS, OF COURSE, IT COULD HURT
ME IN ANY WAY.

104
00:06:02,241 --> 00:06:06,680
IN WHICH I WAS, I'LL THROW HIM
UNDER MUST HAVE MAMDANI'S FREE
BUSES.

105
00:06:06,681 --> 00:06:08,254
FINAL

106
00:06:08,254 --> 00:06:12,267
>> I HAVE A QUESTION.
MR. PRESIDENT, MORE AMERICANS
INCLUDING YOUR OWN VOTERS

107
00:06:12,267 --> 00:06:14,774
BLAME
YOU FOR THE AFFORDABILITY
CRISIS.

108
00:06:14,774 --> 00:06:17,337
WHAT'S YOUR MESSAGE TO THEM?

109
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:22,830
>> SHH, HE'S SLEEPING.

110
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:26,700
WE GOT TO GET HIM TO ANOTHER MRI
BEFORE HE WAKES UP.

111
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:30,781
AND LIVE FROM NEW YORK, IT'S
SATURDAY NIGHT!

112
00:08:34,001 --> 00:08:37,761
MUSICAL

113
00:08:38,398 --> 00:08:43,590
HOST

114
00:08:46,006 --> 00:08:51,861
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN -- MELISSA
McCARTHY!

115
00:09:14,297 --> 00:09:18,358
>> THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK
YOU VERY MUCH.

116
00:09:18,358 --> 00:09:21,765
IT IS SO GREAT TO BE HERE
HOSTING "SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE"

117
00:09:21,765 --> 00:09:24,060
FOR THE SIXTH TIME.

118
00:09:25,915 --> 00:09:29,720
ALSO, DURING THE HOLIDAYS.
I MEAN, COME ON, PINCH ME.

119
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:32,046
THERE'S NOTHING BETTER THAN
CHRISTMAS IN NEW YORK.

120
00:09:32,046 --> 00:09:35,724
THIS SPECIAL TIME OF YEAR.
IT'S ABOUT FAMILY AND FRIENDS

121
00:09:35,724 --> 00:09:37,663
AND CLASSIC CHRISTMAS MUSIC.

122
00:09:37,663 --> 00:09:40,421
COME ON, SET THE MOOD, GANG.

123
00:09:40,421 --> 00:09:42,685
OH, THAT'S NICE.

124
00:09:42,685 --> 00:09:46,611
SPEAKING OF MUSIC, THERE'S
SOMETHING MOST PEOPLE DON'T KNOW
ABOUT ME.

125
00:09:46,611 --> 00:09:49,893
IS THAT I AM A MUSICIAN.

126
00:09:49,893 --> 00:09:54,976
AND MY INSTRUMENT -- AND MY
INSTRUMENT IS THE MOUTH HORN.

127
00:09:54,976 --> 00:09:58,179
THAT'S RIGHT.
IT'S THE MOUTH HORN.

128
00:09:58,179 --> 00:10:00,746
AND I'M A BIT NERVOUS, BUT --

129
00:10:00,746 --> 00:10:03,086
MAYBE IF WE BRING DOWN THE
LIGHTS?

130
00:10:03,154 --> 00:10:07,122
I CAN GIVE YOU A LITTLE TASTE OF
CHRISTMAS.

131
00:10:29,964 --> 00:10:33,394
>> SOAK IT UP, SOAK IT UP, THANK
YOU.

132
00:10:33,394 --> 00:10:37,490
OH, MY GOSH, YOU'RE AMAZING.
JUST SAY NICE THINGS TO ME.

133
00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:39,878
OH, I LOVE THIS TIME OF YEAR,
THOUGH.

134
00:10:39,878 --> 00:10:43,368
THE TREE IS LIT AND SANTA'S
CHECKING HIS LIST.

135
00:10:43,368 --> 00:10:47,997
HE'S GOT NAUGHTY AND NICE AND
EPSTEIN.

136
00:10:48,377 --> 00:10:51,259
WE COULD ALL USE A LITTLE
CHRISTMAS MAGIC.

137
00:10:51,259 --> 00:10:55,350
SO HOW ABOUT WE PUT A LITTLE BIT
OF SNOW TO GET US IN THE HOLIDAY
MOOD?

138
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:58,877
AH, COME ON.
SNL

139
00:10:58,877 --> 00:11:01,387
DON'T BE STINGY WITH THE SNOW.

140
00:11:01,387 --> 00:11:05,314
ALL RIGHT?
HERE IT IS.

141
00:11:08,532 --> 00:11:12,728
THAT IS TOO MUCH!
THAT IS TOO MUCH!

142
00:11:12,728 --> 00:11:14,541
I'LL TAKE IT.

143
00:11:14,541 --> 00:11:17,747
YOU KNOW, THE HOLIDAYS ARE
ALWAYS SENTIMENTAL FOR ME.

144
00:11:17,747 --> 00:11:21,477
THERE'S THE CLASSIC PAIRINGS.
COOKIES AND MILK.

145
00:11:21,477 --> 00:11:23,148
HAM AND GLAZE.

146
00:11:23,148 --> 00:11:27,885
AND EVERYBODY'S FAVORITE.
MOUTH HORN AND A PIANO DUET.

147
00:11:27,885 --> 00:11:31,350
I SHOULD HAVE ASKED SANTA NOR A
PIANO -- BUT

148
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:34,817
WAIT A MINUTE.
LOOKS LIKE I JUST GOT MY WISH.

149
00:11:34,817 --> 00:11:37,444
WHEN I WAS A LITTLE GIRL, MY
FAVORITE SONG WAS --

150
00:11:37,444 --> 00:11:40,259
OKAY, STOP.

SORRY.
I HAD TO COME BACK BECAUSE I --

206
00:15:16,435 --> 00:15:20,042
I JUST -- I CAN'T NOT REPAY YOUR
KINDNESS.

207
00:15:20,042 --> 00:15:23,839
SO I WANTED -- I HAVE TO GIVE
YOU SOMETHING.

208
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:28,664
I WANT YOU TO TAKE THIS RING.
THIS IS MY MOTHER'S.

209
00:15:28,864 --> 00:15:32,378
NOT MY BIOLOGICAL MOTHER, YOU KNOW,

210
00:15:32,378 --> 00:15:34,204
BECAUSE I WAS ABANDONED IN
INFANCY.

211
00:15:34,204 --> 00:15:37,159
BUT THIS BELONGED -- THIS BELONGED

212
00:15:37,159 --> 00:15:40,902
TO THE WOMAN THAT WAS
MY FOSTER MOTHER WHO'S MY MOM TO
ME.

MY FINGERS ARE HERE, YES, YOU
CAN.

215
00:15:48,713 --> 00:15:52,764
ANYWAY, SHE WAS ALWAYS LIKE, I'M
NOT YOUR MOTHER,

216
00:15:52,764 --> 00:15:55,721
I'M BARELY YOUR
FOSTER MOTHER, STOP TELLING
PEOPLE I'M YOUR MOTHER.

217
00:15:55,721 --> 00:15:58,155
I'D SAY, I'M NOT TELLING ANYONE YOU'RE MY MOTHER

218
00:15:58,155 --> 00:16:01,831
BECAUSE YOU
DON'T LET ME GO TO SCHOOL, SO I
DON'T HAVE ANYONE TO TALK TO!

219
00:16:05,179 --> 00:16:09,152
>> HA HA HA!
MOMS, RIGHT?

>> WOW, SORRY -- SORRY ABOUT
THAT.

224
00:16:20,805 --> 00:16:24,220
BUT I'M JUST WONDERING IF I MAY

225
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:27,992
EXPRESS MY THANKS TO YOU
PHYSICALLY.

226
00:16:28,075 --> 00:16:32,006
MAY I -- MAY I GIVE YOU A HUG?

227
00:16:32,006 --> 00:16:36,999
>> SURE.
YOU KNOW -- BUT THEN YOU'VE GOT
TO GO, OKAY?
>> OKAY.

>> WOW, THAT'S -- THAT'S THE
BEST HUG I'VE EVER HAD.

231
00:16:57,914 --> 00:17:01,482
I MEAN, NOT JUST BECAUSE IT'S MY
FIRST HUG, WHICH IT WAS.

232
00:17:01,482 --> 00:17:04,093
IT WAS REALLY GOOD.

233
00:17:04,093 --> 00:17:08,779
>> HI, MA'AM.
DO YOU HAVE A DOG TIED UP IN THE
FRONT OF THE STORE?

234
00:17:08,779 --> 00:17:12,104
>> YOU GOT TO BE MORE SPECIFIC
THAN THAT.

235
00:17:12,104 --> 00:17:15,867
>> OKAY, DO YOU HAVE SIX DOGS
TIED UP OUTSIDE?

236
00:17:15,867 --> 00:17:19,284
>> LET'S SEE.
FOUR, FIVE, SIX -- YEAH, THOSE
ARE MINE, PROBABLY.

237
00:17:19,284 --> 00:17:22,383
>> OKAY, WELL, THEY'RE BARKING
AT PEOPLE OF COLOR.

238
00:17:22,383 --> 00:17:26,925
AND ONE BIT THE SALVATION ARMY
BELL RINGER.

239
00:17:26,925 --> 00:17:29,306
SO COULD YOU PLEASE GO ATTEND TO
THEM?

240
00:17:29,306 --> 00:17:32,455
>> WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT?
WHY DON'T YOU JUST --

241
00:17:32,455 --> 00:17:36,874
RIGHT? WHY DON'T YOU JUST UNTIE THEM
AND LET THEM RUN OFF.

242
00:17:36,874 --> 00:17:40,045
RIGHT?
BECAUSE THEY'VE BECOME A DRAIN
TO US.

243
00:17:40,045 --> 00:17:43,505
AND OUR FINANCES.
AND JUST A BURDEN TO US.

244
00:17:43,505 --> 00:17:45,277
>> I DON'T KNOW HER, I DON'T
KNOW HER.

245
00:17:45,277 --> 00:17:49,693
>> DO YOU WANT ME TO UNTIE YOUR
DOGS AND LET THEM RUN AWAY?

247
00:17:50,942 --> 00:17:54,463
>> YES.
WHAT DID YOU SAY?
>> I DON'T KNOW YOU.

248
00:17:54,463 --> 00:17:59,365
>> HE SAID, TAKE THEIR COLLARS
OFF SO THEY CAN'T BE BROUGHT
BACK TO US.

249
00:17:59,365 --> 00:18:04,795
>> I'M NOT GOING TO DO THAT, SO
PLEASE ATTEND TO YOUR DOGS.
>> OKAY.

250
00:18:06,156 --> 00:18:08,900

WANTED TO REPAY YOUR KINDNESS.

253
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:29,898

JESUS!
IT'S A REAL GUN!

268
00:20:39,258 --> 00:20:41,706
WHO GAVE THIS TO YOU?

269
00:20:42,846 --> 00:20:45,316

YOU GUYS, PEOPLE?

302
00:23:19,426 --> 00:23:23,238
>> YES, HAVE A SEAT, DONNA,
RIGHT HERE.

303
00:23:24,032 --> 00:23:27,627
>> A LOT NICER THAN THE INSIDE
OF MY TRUCK.

304
00:23:27,627 --> 00:23:30,172
>> YES.
IT'S A LITTLE DIFFERENT.

305
00:23:30,172 --> 00:23:32,586
DONNA, I'M CAROL SHAW.

306
00:23:32,586 --> 00:23:34,851

307
00:23:34,851 --> 00:23:36,926

WE'RE HERE FROM U.P.S. PERSONNEL
MANAGEMENT.

310
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:46,384
WE RECEIVED SOME COMPLAINTS FROM
A CUSTOMER ON YOUR ROUTE.

311
00:23:46,384 --> 00:23:49,131
>> NO, THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.
Y'ALL TAKE CARE.

312
00:23:49,131 --> 00:23:51,017
>> NO!

313
00:23:51,017 --> 00:23:53,472
>> DONNA, DON'T GET UP.
WE'RE NOT DONE,

314
00:23:53,472 --> 00:23:56,053
WE'LL TELL
YOU WHEN WE'RE DONE, HAVE A
SEAT.

315
00:23:56,053 --> 00:24:01,965
THE CUSTOMER PROVIDED VIDEO
EVIDENCE FROM THEIR DOORBELL CAMERA

316
00:24:01,965 --> 00:24:04,160
THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO
SHARE WITH YOU, OKAY?

317
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:06,698
SO JUST LOOK RIGHT HERE, DONNA.

318
00:24:11,201 --> 00:24:14,553
>> STUPID RICH PEOPLE AND YOUR
PAVERS.

319
00:24:20,777 --> 00:24:23,563
IS THAT YOUR PORCH?

320
00:24:25,375 --> 00:24:29,049
>> ALL RIGHT.
DO YOU CARE TO EXPLAIN THAT,
DONNA?

321
00:24:29,049 --> 00:24:32,809
>> YOU KNOW -- I'LL BE HONEST.

322
00:24:32,809 --> 00:24:36,909
I WAS ABOUT TO USE MY OLD
STANDBY TRICK AND PRETEND TO
FAINT.

323
00:24:36,909 --> 00:24:39,851
BUT I WON'T.
I'M GOING TO OWN MY MISTAKE.

324
00:24:39,851 --> 00:24:42,045
I MESSED UP, AND I'M SORRY,

325
00:24:42,045 --> 00:24:44,523
IT WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN, AND YAW ALL
TAKE CARE.

326
00:24:44,523 --> 00:24:48,958
>> NO, DONNA.
COME BACK.
COME PACK.

327
00:24:48,958 --> 00:24:50,808
BECAUSE IT DID HAPPEN AGAIN.

328
00:24:50,808 --> 00:24:54,623
>> NO, THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.
>> IT'S VERY POSSIBLE.

329
00:24:54,623 --> 00:24:57,589
A FEW DAYS LATER, AT THE SAME HOME,

330
00:24:57,589 --> 00:25:01,096
AFTER PLACING A PACKAGE ON
THEIR DOORSTEP --

331
00:25:01,096 --> 00:25:03,308
YOU DID THIS.

332
00:25:03,308 --> 00:25:05,853
>> ELBOW

333
00:25:13,387 --> 00:25:15,829
OH, IT'S CASHMERE, HUH?

334
00:25:15,829 --> 00:25:19,324
HOW'S THAT?
HOW'S THAT?

335
00:25:29,984 --> 00:25:32,855
>> DONNA.
>> WE KNOW --

336
00:25:32,855 --> 00:25:35,197
>> DONNA.
>> STOP PRETENDING TO FAINT.

337
00:25:35,197 --> 00:25:36,963
>> STOP PUSHING YOURSELF OUT THE
DOOR.

338
00:25:36,963 --> 00:25:38,643
>> WHAT ARE YOU DOING, DONNA?

339
00:25:38,643 --> 00:25:41,345
IF YOU FAINTED, HOW CAN YOU DO
THAT, DONNA?

340
00:25:41,345 --> 00:25:45,192
>> COME BACK, COME BACK.
DONNA!

341
00:25:45,192 --> 00:25:48,035
>> DONNA, COME ON.
>> DONNA!

342
00:25:48,035 --> 00:25:50,799
DON'T GO OUT THE DOOR, DONNA.

343
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:53,904
COME BACK.
COME ON.

344
00:25:53,904 --> 00:25:55,840
>> I JUST UNFAINTED.

345
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:58,671
>> YOU DIDN'T FAINT, YOU DIDN'T
FAINT.

346
00:25:58,671 --> 00:26:01,771
>> DONNA, THIS IS SERIOUS.
YOU BROKE THE LAW.

347
00:26:01,771 --> 00:26:05,178
>> BROKE THE LAW?
COME ED -- COME ON,

348
00:26:05,178 --> 00:26:08,220
SHE SHOULD
GO OUTSIDE, SHE'S NEVER GOOD AT
THIS.

349
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:11,051
>> I'M NOT GOING OUTSIDE, DONNA.

350
00:26:11,051 --> 00:26:13,120
ACTUALLY, I'M ED'S SUPERIOR.

351
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:16,124
AND YOU BROKE A FEW LAWS,
ACTUALLY.

352
00:26:16,124 --> 00:26:19,280
BECAUSE YOU CAME BACK LATER, AND
YOU WERE QUITE BUSY.

353
00:26:21,208 --> 00:26:23,126
>> LOOK.

354
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:25,720
DUMPING OUT THE TRASH,

355
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:28,835
I'M RECYCLING.
>> YOU'RE NOT RECYCLING.

356
00:26:28,835 --> 00:26:32,592
DESTROYED A FLOWER POT.
- IT'S

357
00:26:32,592 --> 00:26:35,342
YOU PUT A LIVE BAT IN THEIR
HOUSE.

358
00:26:35,342 --> 00:26:47,221
>> THAT WAS A BAT RESCUE, I

359
00:26:47,223 --> 00:26:47,788
RESCUED THAT BAT.

360
00:26:47,790 --> 00:26:49,223
>> IT WAS NOT A BAT RESCUE.

361
00:26:49,225 --> 00:26:51,258
>> IT WAS A BAT RESCUE.

362
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:53,293
LOOK, YOU KNOW -- IT WAS AWHILE

363
00:26:53,295 --> 00:26:53,994
AGO, OKAY?

364
00:26:53,996 --> 00:26:55,329
IT'S OUT OF MY SYSTEM NOW.

365
00:26:55,331 --> 00:26:56,330
AND I'VE MOVED ON.

366
00:26:56,332 --> 00:26:57,131
>> OH, OKAY.

367
00:26:57,133 --> 00:26:57,765
WELL, THIS VIDEO IS FROM

368
00:26:57,767 --> 00:27:04,238

00:27:07,777 --> 00:27:11,211
I MEAN, COME ON, DONNA.

371
00:27:11,213 --> 00:27:11,912
>> I COULD BE DOING ANYTHING.

372
00:27:11,914 --> 00:27:13,447
>> NO.

373
00:27:13,449 --> 00:27:15,049
>> IT'S NOT MY FAULT, OKAY?

374
00:27:15,051 --> 00:27:15,916
I'M A HUMAN BEING, I HAD TO GO,

375
00:27:15,918 --> 00:27:18,018
AND I COULDN'T HOLD IT.

YOU CAN'T TRUST THAT VIDEO.

388
00:27:40,776 --> 00:27:41,975
DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING IN WRITING?

389
00:27:41,977 --> 00:27:43,210
I'D LIKE TO SEE THE COMPLAINT IN

390
