1
00:00:01,719 --> 00:00:03,446
>>> YOU'RE WATCHING C-SPAN.

2
00:00:03,446 --> 00:00:05,663
HEY, NETFLIX, WE'RE FOR SALE,
TOO.

3
00:00:05,663 --> 00:00:10,749
WE NOW GO TO THE PENTAGON FOR A
PRESS CONFERENCE WITH THE
SECRETARY OF DEFENSE.

4
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:16,687
>> LADIES AND GENTLEMEN OF THE PRESS,
AS YOU KNOW THERE HAVE BEEN CONCERNS

5
00:00:16,687 --> 00:00:20,223
ABOUT ONGOING
MILITARY ACTION OFF THE COAST OF
VENEZUELA.

6
00:00:20,223 --> 00:00:24,665
HERE TO ANSWER ALL YOUR
QUESTIONS IN A CALM,
NONAGGRESSIVE FASHION

7
00:00:24,665 --> 00:00:31,309
IS SECRETARY OF WAR -- PETE HEGSETH!

8
00:00:40,362 --> 00:00:41,997
>> YEAH!

9
00:00:41,997 --> 00:00:45,344
SHUT THE HELL UP, SHUT UP, CUT
THE MUSIC.

10
00:00:45,344 --> 00:00:46,993
WHAT?

11
00:00:46,993 --> 00:00:51,258
FIRST THINGS FIRST.
WHERE ARE THE FATTIES?

12
00:00:51,258 --> 00:00:54,099
YOU, OUT.

13
00:00:54,099 --> 00:00:56,897
>> WHAT?
I'M NOT EVEN FAT.

14
00:00:56,897 --> 00:01:00,697
>> BOO, REALLY?
YOU THINK YOU'RE HIDING UNDER
THAT BLAZER, PORKY?

15
00:01:00,697 --> 00:01:03,765
WHO DO YOU WRITE FOR, "THE
CHICAGO TROMBONE"?

16
00:01:03,765 --> 00:01:07,904
THAT'S WHAT THEY PLAY WHEN YOUR
FAT ASS WALKS AROUND.

17
00:01:07,904 --> 00:01:12,423
LISTEN UP.
AS YOU PROBABLY READ IN SOME GAY
NEWSPAPER,

18
00:01:12,423 --> 00:01:15,074
WE'RE NOW AT WAR WITH
VENEZUELA.

19
00:01:15,074 --> 00:01:18,775
OH, YOU NERDS ARE LIKE, WAIT,
WAS THERE AN OFFICIAL
DECLARATION OF WAR?

20
00:01:18,775 --> 00:01:20,363
YEAH, IT'S RIGHT HERE.

21
00:01:20,363 --> 00:01:23,799
SUPERFINGER, DANE COOK.

22
00:01:25,125 --> 00:01:27,741
YOU GOT QUESTIONS, FINE,

23
00:01:27,741 --> 00:01:31,723
PRETEND I'M A RANDOM FISHING BOAT AND
FIRE AWAY.

24
00:01:32,216 --> 00:01:37,304
>> OKAY.
IS THERE ANY TRUTH TO THE
ALLEGATIONS

25
00:01:37,304 --> 00:01:40,633
THAT AFTER AN
INITIAL STRIKE ON A DRUG
SMUGGLING BOAT,

26
00:01:40,633 --> 00:01:44,627
YOU ORDERED A
SECOND STRIKE TO KILL THE
SURVIVORS?

27
00:01:44,627 --> 00:01:47,856
>> UH, FIRST OF ALL, THAT KIND
OF CRUEL, HEARTLESS ACT

28
00:01:47,856 --> 00:01:51,366
HAS NO
PLACE IN "OPERATION KILL
EVERYBODY."

29
00:01:51,366 --> 00:01:54,422
SECOND, I WASN'T EVEN IN THE
ROOM WHEN IT HAPPENED, OKAY?

30
00:01:54,422 --> 00:01:58,890
I WAS SO JACKED UP AFTER THE
FIRST STRIKE, I HAD TO MAKE AN
EMERGENCY CALL TO MY SPONSOR --

31
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:02,413
SORRY, A GUY I MET IN AN ONUS IN MEETING --

32
00:02:02,413 --> 00:02:05,583
SO I DON'T DRINK
SOMETHING --
¶ THAT I LIKE

33
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:08,722
BUT I CAN'T HAVE BUT I WANT IT
BUT I NEED IT AND I WANT IT RIGHT NOW

34
00:02:08,722 --> 00:02:11,515
BUP BUP BUP IT'S
BOOZE ¶

35
00:02:13,224 --> 00:02:15,000
NEXT QUESTION?

36
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,738
>> YES, WHAT DID YOU SAY TO
SENATOR MARK KELLY,

37
00:02:17,738 --> 00:02:21,048
WHO SAID YOU
ACT LIKE A 12-YEAR-OLD PLAYING
ARMY?

38
00:02:21,048 --> 00:02:23,993
>> KELLY, THAT'S A GIRL'S NAME.

39
00:02:23,993 --> 00:02:27,099
WHAT'S HIS FIRST NAME, DRESS?

40
00:02:27,099 --> 00:02:30,769
>> NO.
IT'S MARK LIKE I SAID.

41
00:02:30,769 --> 00:02:33,497
>> OH, GET A HUSBAND.

42
00:02:33,497 --> 00:02:36,496
>> I'M TRYING!

43
00:02:36,496 --> 00:02:40,005
>> TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION, IF I
WAS JUST PLAYING ARMY,

44
00:02:40,005 --> 00:02:41,912
WOULD
THERE BE 80 DEAD FISHERMEN --

45
00:02:41,912 --> 00:02:45,124
NARCOTERRORISTS?
VENEZUELA RIGHT NOW?

46
00:02:45,124 --> 00:02:46,270
NEXT QUESTION.

47
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:49,167
>> YEAH, SO IS 80 THE OFFICIAL
DEATH TOLL?

48
00:02:49,167 --> 00:02:51,298
>> IS 80 THE OFFICIAL --

49
00:02:51,298 --> 00:02:54,838
NO, IT'S 6-7, 6-7.

50
00:02:54,838 --> 00:02:56,794
IDIOT.

51
00:02:56,794 --> 00:03:00,343
LET'S JUST SAY IF I HAD A DRINK
FOR EVERY VENEZUELAN WE'VE KILLED,

52
00:03:00,343 --> 00:03:03,149
I'D REALLY LIKE THAT
NUMBER OF DRINKS.

53
00:03:03,149 --> 00:03:07,348
ALL RIGHT, NEXT?
OH, MY GOD, IS THAT MATT GAETZ?

54
00:03:08,268 --> 00:03:11,622
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
IT'S ME, MATT GAETZ.

55
00:03:11,622 --> 00:03:14,016
I'M A REPORTER NOW.

56
00:03:14,016 --> 00:03:19,131
QUESTION.
YOU'RE ONLY KILLING PEOPLE WHO
ARE TRAFFICKING DRUGS, RIGHT?

57
00:03:19,131 --> 00:03:22,743
SO HYPOTHETICALLY, IF SOMEONE
WERE TRAFFICKING SOMETHING ELSE --

58
00:03:22,743 --> 00:03:25,125
THEY'D BE OKAY?

59
00:03:25,526 --> 00:03:29,123
>> WE'RE TARGETING DRUG
SMUGGLERS EXCLUSIVELY.

60
00:03:29,123 --> 00:03:32,948
>> DIGGY, NO FURTHER QUESTIONS,
YOUR HONOR.

61
00:03:32,948 --> 00:03:36,029
>> I HAVE A QUESTION.
>> OH, JESUS.

62
00:03:36,029 --> 00:03:38,714
YEAH, WILL & GRACE, GO.

63
00:03:38,714 --> 00:03:41,742
>> MY NAME IS ACTUALLY WILLIAM
GRACE.

64
00:03:41,742 --> 00:03:46,109
HOW DO YOU RESPOND TO THE
ALLEGATIONS THAT THE SO-CALLED
WAR ON SMUGGLERS

65
00:03:46,109 --> 00:03:48,300
IS A SMOKE
SCREEN FOR REGIME CHANGE?

66
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:52,363
>> OH, WHOA, WAY TO SOLVE THE
MYSTERY, SCOOB.

67
00:03:52,363 --> 00:03:55,699
OF COURSE THAT'S WHAT WE'RE
DOING AND IT ALWAYS WORKS.

68
00:03:55,699 --> 00:03:58,861
JUST LIKE IT DID IN GUATEMALA,
NICARAGUA,

69
00:03:58,861 --> 00:04:02,949
CUBA, BRAZIL,
BOLIVIA, PANAMA
¶ HAITI ELSALVADOR

70
00:04:02,949 --> 00:04:06,326
CHILI
HONDURAS PERU" ANIMANIACS!

71
00:04:07,334 --> 00:04:08,933
DONE

72
00:04:08,933 --> 00:04:11,651
NERDS

73
00:04:11,651 --> 00:04:15,127
>> SECRETARYING HE GET, SOME
PEOPLE ACCUSE YOU OF HAR CRIMES.

74
00:04:15,127 --> 00:04:17,436
EVEN THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN
DISTANCING HIMSELF FROM YOU.

75
00:04:17,436 --> 00:04:19,702
>> I HAVE A QUESTION FOR YOU,

76
00:04:19,702 --> 00:04:21,917
HAVE YOU EVER KISSED A GIRL?

77
00:04:21,917 --> 00:04:24,888
I'M GENUINELY ASKING.

78
00:04:24,888 --> 00:04:26,946
>> I HAVE A WIFE.

79
00:04:26,946 --> 00:04:31,323
>> OKAY, SEND HERMES WAY WHEN
SHE WANTS TO ACTUALLY FEEL
SOMETHING.

80
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:39,300
ANYWAY, TO ANSWER YOUR
QUESTION -- PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS
MY BACK 100%.

81
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:42,025
YOU WANT TO KNOW WHY?
UNLIKE YOU BETA CUCKS,

82
00:04:42,025 --> 00:04:46,845
HE'S A
HIGH-ENERGY ALPHA WHO TRUSTS ME
AND LISTENS TO ME NO MATTER WHAT,

83
00:04:46,845 --> 00:04:49,840
ISN'T THAT RIGHT, MR.
PRESIDENT?

84
00:04:56,444 --> 00:05:00,981
>> STOP, MAMDANI!

85
00:05:01,791 --> 00:05:05,745
YOU CAN FREEZE MY RENT ANY TIME.

86
00:05:07,208 --> 00:05:10,927
I WASN'T SLEEPING.
I'M VERY MUCH AWAKE.

87
00:05:10,927 --> 00:05:12,973
NOW SOMEONE QUICKLY TELL ME,

88
00:05:12,973 --> 00:05:17,718
WHERE AM I, WHO MY, AND WHAT
YEAR MIGHT IT BE?

89
00:05:17,718 --> 00:05:19,792
>> GOOD ONE, MR. PRESIDENT.

90
00:05:19,792 --> 00:05:23,095
EVERYTHING YOU DO THAT'S WEIRD,
IT'S A JOKE.

91
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:28,624
I WAS JUST TELLING EVERYONE THAT
I HAD YOUR FULL SUPPORT.

92
00:05:28,624 --> 00:05:30,555
>> ABSOLUTELY.
WE LOVE PETE.

93
00:05:30,555 --> 00:05:34,313
HE'S A GREAT GUY.
HE WAS JUST FOG OF WAR, RIGHT?

94
00:05:34,313 --> 00:05:37,452
FOG OF WAR.
IT'S A THING YOU ONLY SAY

95
00:05:37,452 --> 00:05:39,714
AFTER
DOING WAR CRIME.

96
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:41,974
RIGHT?
YOU NEVER HEAR A GENERAL GO,

97
00:05:41,974 --> 00:05:45,434
"EVERYTHING WENT ACCORDING TO
PLAN IN FOG OF WAR."

98
00:05:45,434 --> 00:05:48,317
IT'S LIKE WHEN YOU GO INTO THE
SAUNA AT EQUINOX

99
00:05:48,317 --> 00:05:51,465
AND SUDDENLY
YOU'RE DOING STUFF YOU NEVER DID
BEFORE.

100
00:05:51,465 --> 00:05:54,822
FOG OF WAR.
FOG OF WAR, WE LOVE IT.

101
00:05:54,822 --> 00:05:56,738
IT'S A GREAT NEW EXCUSE, WE LOVE
IT.

102
00:05:56,738 --> 00:06:00,014
SO I STAND BY PETE.
AND NOTHING CAN CHANGE MY MIND.

103
00:06:00,014 --> 00:06:02,241
UNLESS, OF COURSE, IT COULD HURT
ME IN ANY WAY.

104
00:06:02,241 --> 00:06:06,680
IN WHICH I WAS, I'LL THROW HIM
UNDER ONE OF MAMDANI'S FREE
BUSES.

105
00:06:06,681 --> 00:06:08,254
FINAL

106
00:06:08,254 --> 00:06:12,267
>> I HAVE A QUESTION.
MR. PRESIDENT, MORE AMERICANS
INCLUDING YOUR OWN VOTERS

107
00:06:12,267 --> 00:06:14,774
BLAME
YOU FOR THE AFFORDABILITY
CRISIS.

108
00:06:14,774 --> 00:06:17,337
WHAT'S YOUR MESSAGE TO THEM?

109
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:22,830
>> SHH, HE'S SLEEPING.

110
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:26,700
WE GOT TO GET HIM TO ANOTHER MRI
BEFORE HE WAKES UP.

111
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:30,781
AND LIVE FROM NEW YORK, IT'S
SATURDAY NIGHT!

112
00:08:34,001 --> 00:08:37,761
MUSICAL

113
00:08:38,398 --> 00:08:43,590
HOST

114
00:08:46,006 --> 00:08:51,861
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN -- MELISSA
McCARTHY!

115
00:09:14,297 --> 00:09:18,358
>> THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK
YOU VERY MUCH.

116
00:09:18,358 --> 00:09:21,765
IT IS SO GREAT TO BE HERE
HOSTING "SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE"

117
00:09:21,765 --> 00:09:24,060
FOR THE SIXTH TIME.

118
00:09:25,915 --> 00:09:29,720
ALSO, DURING THE HOLIDAYS.
I MEAN, COME ON, PINCH ME.

119
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:32,046
THERE'S NOTHING BETTER THAN
CHRISTMAS IN NEW YORK.

120
00:09:32,046 --> 00:09:35,724
THIS SPECIAL TIME OF YEAR.
IT'S ABOUT FAMILY AND FRIENDS

121
00:09:35,724 --> 00:09:37,663
AND CLASSIC CHRISTMAS MUSIC.

122
00:09:37,663 --> 00:09:40,421
COME ON, SET THE MOOD, GANG.

123
00:09:40,421 --> 00:09:42,685
OH, THAT'S NICE.

124
00:09:42,685 --> 00:09:46,611
SPEAKING OF MUSIC, THERE'S
SOMETHING MOST PEOPLE DON'T KNOW
ABOUT ME.

125
00:09:46,611 --> 00:09:49,893
IS THAT I AM A MUSICIAN.

126
00:09:49,893 --> 00:09:54,976
AND MY INSTRUMENT -- AND MY
INSTRUMENT IS THE MOUTH HORN.

127
00:09:54,976 --> 00:09:58,179
THAT'S RIGHT.
IT'S THE MOUTH HORN.

128
00:09:58,179 --> 00:10:00,746
AND I'M A BIT NERVOUS, BUT --

129
00:10:00,746 --> 00:10:03,090
MAYBE IF WE BRING DOWN THE
LIGHTS?

130
00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:07,122
I CAN GIVE YOU A LITTLE TASTE OF
CHRISTMAS.

131
00:10:29,964 --> 00:10:33,394
>> SOAK IT UP, SOAK IT UP, THANK
YOU.

132
00:10:33,394 --> 00:10:37,490
OH, MY GOSH, YOU'RE AMAZING.
JUST SAY NICE THINGS TO ME.

133
00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:39,878
OH, I LOVE THIS TIME OF YEAR,
THOUGH.

134
00:10:39,878 --> 00:10:43,368
THE TREE IS LIT AND SANTA'S
CHECKING HIS LIST.

135
00:10:43,368 --> 00:10:47,997
HE'S GOT NAUGHTY AND NICE AND
EPSTEIN.

136
00:10:48,377 --> 00:10:51,259
WE COULD ALL USE A LITTLE
CHRISTMAS MAGIC.

137
00:10:51,259 --> 00:10:55,350
SO HOW ABOUT WE PUT A LITTLE BIT
OF SNOW TO GET US IN THE HOLIDAY
MOOD?

138
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:58,877
AH, COME ON.
SNL

139
00:10:58,877 --> 00:11:01,387
DON'T BE STINGY WITH THE SNOW.

140
00:11:01,387 --> 00:11:05,314
ALL RIGHT?
HERE IT IS.

141
00:11:08,532 --> 00:11:12,728
THAT IS TOO MUCH!
THAT IS TOO MUCH!

142
00:11:12,728 --> 00:11:14,541
I'LL TAKE IT.

143
00:11:14,541 --> 00:11:17,747
YOU KNOW, THE HOLIDAYS ARE
ALWAYS SENTIMENTAL FOR ME.

144
00:11:17,747 --> 00:11:21,477
THERE'S THE CLASSIC PAIRINGS.
COOKIES AND MILK.

145
00:11:21,477 --> 00:11:23,148
HAM AND GLAZE.

146
00:11:23,148 --> 00:11:27,885
AND EVERYBODY'S FAVORITE.
MOUTH HORN AND A PIANO DUET.

147
00:11:27,885 --> 00:11:31,350
I SHOULD HAVE ASKED SANTA NOR A
PIANO -- BUT

148
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:34,817
WAIT A MINUTE.
LOOKS LIKE I JUST GOT MY WISH.

149
00:11:34,817 --> 00:11:37,444
WHEN I WAS A LITTLE GIRL, MY
FAVORITE SONG WAS --

150
00:11:37,444 --> 00:11:40,259
OKAY, STOP.

SORRY.
I HAD TO COME BACK BECAUSE I --

206
00:15:16,435 --> 00:15:20,042
I JUST -- I CAN'T NOT REPAY YOUR
KINDNESS.

207
00:15:20,042 --> 00:15:23,839
SO I WANTED -- I HAVE TO GIVE
YOU SOMETHING.

208
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:28,864
I WANT YOU TO TAKE THIS RING.
THIS IS MY MOTHER'S.

209
00:15:28,864 --> 00:15:32,378
NOT MY BIOLOGICAL MOTHER, YOU KNOW,

210
00:15:32,378 --> 00:15:34,204
BECAUSE I WAS ABANDONED IN
INFANCY.

211
00:15:34,204 --> 00:15:37,159
BUT THIS BELONGED -- THIS BELONGED

212
00:15:37,159 --> 00:15:40,902
TO THE WOMAN THAT WAS
MY FOSTER MOTHER WHO'S MY MOM TO
ME.

MY FINGERS ARE HERE, YES, YOU
CAN.

215
00:15:48,713 --> 00:15:52,764
ANYWAY, SHE WAS ALWAYS LIKE, I'M
NOT YOUR MOTHER,

216
00:15:52,764 --> 00:15:55,721
I'M BARELY YOUR
FOSTER MOTHER, STOP TELLING
PEOPLE I'M YOUR MOTHER.

217
00:15:55,721 --> 00:15:58,155
I'D SAY, I'M NOT TELLING ANYONE YOU'RE MY MOTHER

218
00:15:58,155 --> 00:16:01,831
BECAUSE YOU
DON'T LET ME GO TO SCHOOL, SO I
DON'T HAVE ANYONE TO TALK TO!

219
00:16:05,179 --> 00:16:09,152
>> HA HA HA!
MOMS, RIGHT?
>> YEAH, RIGHT?

00:16:17,863 --> 00:16:20,805
>> WOW, SORRY -- SORRY ABOUT
THAT.

224
00:16:20,805 --> 00:16:24,220
BUT I'M JUST WONDERING IF I MAY

225
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:28,075
EXPRESS MY THANKS TO YOU
PHYSICALLY.

226
00:16:28,075 --> 00:16:32,006
MAY I -- MAY I GIVE YOU A HUG?

227
00:16:32,006 --> 00:16:36,627
>> SURE.
YOU KNOW -- BUT THEN YOU'VE GOT
TO GO, OKAY?
>> OKAY.

228
00:16:36,627 --> 00:16:39,922

00:16:54,653 --> 00:16:57,814
>> WOW, THAT'S -- THAT'S THE
BEST HUG I'VE EVER HAD.

231
00:16:57,814 --> 00:17:01,482
I MEAN, NOT JUST BECAUSE IT'S MY
FIRST HUG, WHICH IT WAS.

232
00:17:01,482 --> 00:17:04,093
IT WAS REALLY GOOD.

233
00:17:04,093 --> 00:17:08,779
>> HI, MA'AM.
DO YOU HAVE A DOG TIED UP IN THE
FRONT OF THE STORE?

234
00:17:08,779 --> 00:17:12,104
>> YOU GOT TO BE MORE SPECIFIC
THAN THAT.

235
00:17:12,104 --> 00:17:15,867
>> OKAY, DO YOU HAVE SIX DOGS
TIED UP OUTSIDE?

236
00:17:15,867 --> 00:17:19,284
>> LET'S SEE.
FOUR, FIVE, SIX -- YEAH, THOSE
ARE MINE, PROBABLY.

237
00:17:19,284 --> 00:17:22,383
>> OKAY, WELL, THEY'RE BARKING
AT PEOPLE OF COLOR.

238
00:17:22,383 --> 00:17:26,925
AND ONE BIT THE SALVATION ARMY
BELL RINGER.

239
00:17:26,925 --> 00:17:29,306
SO COULD YOU PLEASE GO ATTEND TO
THEM?

240
00:17:29,306 --> 00:17:32,455
>> WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT?
WHY DON'T YOU JUST --

241
00:17:32,455 --> 00:17:36,874
RIGHT? WHY DON'T YOU JUST UNTIE THEM
AND LET THEM RUN OFF.

242
00:17:36,874 --> 00:17:40,045
RIGHT?
BECAUSE THEY'VE BECOME A DRAIN
TO US.

243
00:17:40,045 --> 00:17:43,505
AND OUR FINANCES.
AND JUST A BURDEN TO US.

244
00:17:43,505 --> 00:17:45,277
>> I DON'T KNOW HER, I DON'T
KNOW HER.

245
00:17:45,277 --> 00:17:49,693
>> DO YOU WANT ME TO UNTIE YOUR
DOGS AND LET THEM RUN AWAY?

246

>> I DON'T KNOW YOU.

247
00:17:50,942 --> 00:17:54,463
>> YES.
WHAT DID YOU SAY?
>> I DON'T KNOW YOU.

248
00:17:54,463 --> 00:17:59,365
>> HE SAID, TAKE THEIR COLLARS
OFF SO THEY CAN'T BE BROUGHT
BACK TO US.

249
00:17:59,365 --> 00:18:04,795
>> I'M NOT GOING TO DO THAT, SO
PLEASE ATTEND TO YOUR DOGS.
>> OKAY.

250
00:18:06,156 --> 00:18:08,900

00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:11,214
BUT BEFORE I GO,

252

I JUST REALLY
WANTED TO REPAY YOUR KINDNESS.

253
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:29,898

JESUS!
IT'S A REAL GUN!

268
00:20:39,258 --> 00:20:41,706
WHO GAVE THIS TO YOU?

269
00:20:42,846 --> 00:20:45,316

WE'RE HERE FROM U.P.S. PERSONNEL
MANAGEMENT.

A CUSTOMER ON YOUR ROUTE.

311
00:23:46,384 --> 00:23:49,131

Y'ALL TAKE CARE.

312
00:23:49,131 --> 00:23:51,017

EVIDENCE FROM THEIR DOORBELL CAMERA

316
00:24:01,965 --> 00:24:04,160

SO JUST LOOK RIGHT HERE, DONNA.

318

DONNA?

321
00:24:29,049 --> 00:24:32,809
>> YOU KNOW -- I'LL BE HONEST.

322
00:24:32,809 --> 00:24:36,909
I WAS ABOUT TO USE MY OLD
STANDBY TRICK AND PRETEND TO
FAINT.

323
00:24:36,909 --> 00:24:39,851
BUT I WON'T.
I'M GOING TO OWN MY MISTAKE.

324
00:24:39,851 --> 00:24:42,045

00:24:54,623 --> 00:24:57,589
A FEW DAYS LATER, AT THE SAME HOME,

330
00:24:57,589 --> 00:25:01,096
AFTER PLACING A PACKAGE ON
THEIR DOORSTEP --

331
00:25:01,096 --> 00:25:03,308
YOU DID THIS.

00:25:36,963 --> 00:25:38,643
>> WHAT ARE YOU DOING, DONNA?

339
00:25:38,643 --> 00:25:41,345
IF YOU FAINTED, HOW CAN YOU DO
THAT, DONNA?

340
00:25:41,345 --> 00:25:45,192
>> COME BACK, COME BACK.

341
00:25:45,192 --> 00:25:48,035

FAINT.

346
00:25:58,671 --> 00:26:01,771
>> DONNA, THIS IS SERIOUS.
YOU BROKE THE LAW.

347
00:26:01,771 --> 00:26:05,178
>> BROKE THE LAW?

349
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:11,051
>> I'M NOT GOING OUTSIDE, DONNA.

352
00:26:16,124 --> 00:26:19,280
BECAUSE YOU CAME BACK LATER, AND
YOU WERE QUITE BUSY.

00:26:21,208 --> 00:26:23,190
>> LOOK.

354

356
00:26:28,835 --> 00:26:32,592
DESTROYED A FLOWER POT.

357
00:26:32,592 --> 00:26:35,342
YOU PUT A LIVE BAT IN THEIR
HOUSE.

358
00:26:35,342 --> 00:26:40,178
>> THAT WAS A BAT RESCUE, I
RESCUED THAT BAT.

359
00:26:40,178 --> 00:26:43,979

THANK YOU.

599
00:42:49,715 --> 00:42:52,869
>>> THIS WEEK, A RACCOON WENT VIRAL

600
00:42:52,869 --> 00:42:57,892
AFTER IT BROKE INTO A
LIQUOR STORE IN VIRGINIA,
SMASHED OPEN BOTTLES OF ALCOHOL,

601
00:42:57,892 --> 00:43:01,497
GOT DRUNK, AND PASSED OUT IN THE
BATHROOM.

602
00:43:01,497 --> 00:43:07,336
HERE TO EXPLAIN THEIR ACTIONS IS
THAT DRUNK RACCOON.

603
00:43:11,691 --> 00:43:13,743
>> OH, GOD, COLIN.

604
00:43:13,743 --> 00:43:17,555
WHAT HAPPENED LAST NIGHT?
DID WE HOOK UP?

605
00:43:17,555 --> 00:43:20,010
>> NO, WE DIDN'T HOOK UP, NO.

606
00:43:20,010 --> 00:43:21,723
>> ARE YOU SURE?
>> YES.

607
00:43:21,723 --> 00:43:24,285
>> WE COULD DO IT RIGHT NOW.

608
00:43:25,540 --> 00:43:29,225
YOU LIKE WHAT YOU SEE, COLIN?

609
00:43:30,379 --> 00:43:32,111
OH, MY GOD, ARE YOU OKAY?

610
00:43:32,111 --> 00:43:35,453
>> I'M OKAY, I'M OKAY.

611
00:43:39,027 --> 00:43:42,193
LISTEN

612
00:43:42,607 --> 00:43:46,609
>> STOP, RELAX.
I THINK YOU HAVE A SERIOUS
DRINKING PROBLEM.

613
00:43:46,609 --> 00:43:49,982
>> YEAH, THE PROBLEM BEING, I
CAN'T GET DRUNK IN A BATHROOM

614
00:43:49,982 --> 00:43:54,215
WITHOUT PEOPLE TAKING PICTURES
OF ME FACE-DOWN, ASS-UP.

615
00:43:54,215 --> 00:43:56,768
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY, COLIN.

616
00:43:56,768 --> 00:43:58,759
DRESS FOR THE JOB YOU WANT.

617
00:43:58,759 --> 00:44:01,240
WHORE!

618
00:44:05,062 --> 00:44:07,702
>> NO!
NO, NO, NO.

619
00:44:07,702 --> 00:44:10,652
ALCOHOL

620
00:44:10,652 --> 00:44:14,338
PULL YOURSELF TOGETHER, DRUNK
RAC, YOU'RE ON TV.

621
00:44:14,338 --> 00:44:16,855
>> I KNOW, I KNOW.
YOU NEVER SEE

622
00:44:16,855 --> 00:44:20,999
POSITIVE
REPRESENTATION, HEY.

623
00:44:21,976 --> 00:44:26,835
POSITIVE REPRESENTATIONS OF
RACCOONS IN THE MEDIA.

624
00:44:26,835 --> 00:44:32,020
THE ONLY THING YOU'LL SEE OF US
ON A SCREEN IS US IN A RING
CAMERA LIKE THIS.

625
00:44:39,544 --> 00:44:43,517
>> HOLD ON, HOLD ON.
THERE'S POSITIVE REPRESENTATION --

626
00:44:43,517 --> 00:44:46,918
I MEAN,
DOESN'T BRADLEY COOPER PLAY A
RACCOON IN "GUARDIANS OF THE
GALAXY"?

627
00:44:46,918 --> 00:44:50,867
>> I DON'T KNOW, I'VE NEVER SEEN
IT, I'M NOT A VIRGIN.

628
00:44:51,651 --> 00:44:56,901
COLIN, I THINK IT'S COOL THAT
YOU KNOW STUFF LIKE THAT.

629
00:44:56,901 --> 00:45:00,295
I'M STARVING, SHOULD WE DOORDASH
SOMETHING?

630
00:45:00,295 --> 00:45:03,353
LIKE TIN CANS OR APPLE CORES?

631
00:45:03,353 --> 00:45:07,153
YOU KNOW WHAT'S GOOD THAT YOU
WOULDN'T THINK WAS GOOD?

632
00:45:07,153 --> 00:45:09,112
POOP.

633
00:45:09,112 --> 00:45:12,923
>> THAT'S DISGUSTING.
>> QUIET, PIGGY.

634
00:45:15,780 --> 00:45:18,512
>> YOU ALL RIGHT?
YOU OKAY?

635
00:45:18,512 --> 00:45:21,653
>> SORRY.
FALSE ALARM.
CAME OUT THE OTHER END.

636
00:45:21,653 --> 00:45:24,785
HEY, YOU GOING TO EAT THAT?

637
00:45:24,785 --> 00:45:27,459
>> WAIT, THOSE ARE MY JOKES.

638
00:45:27,459 --> 00:45:30,398
I THOUGHT RACCOONS ONLY ATE
TRASH.

639
00:45:30,398 --> 00:45:35,433
>> EXACTLY.
EXACTLY.

640
00:45:35,433 --> 00:45:38,517
>> OKAY, ALL RIGHT.
YOU KNOW WHAT?

641
00:45:40,807 --> 00:45:43,282
THAT'S ACTUALLY REALLY MEAN.

642
00:45:43,282 --> 00:45:45,415
>> LISTEN, FAT.

643
00:45:45,691 --> 00:45:49,072
I KNOW HOW DISGUSTING YOU THINK
WE RACCOONS ARE.

644
00:45:49,072 --> 00:45:53,368
WE HEAR WHAT YOU CALL US.
TRASH PANDAS.
DUMPSTER DOGS.

645
00:45:53,368 --> 00:45:56,452
THE SARAH SHERMANS OF THE
FOREST.

646
00:45:56,852 --> 00:46:01,681
>> COME ON, YOU'RE NOT NEARLY AS
HAIRY AS SARAH SHERMAN.

647
00:46:02,959 --> 00:46:06,715
LISTEN, I REALLY HOPE YOU GET
THE HELP YOU NEED,

648
00:46:06,715 --> 00:46:09,741
AND I HOPE I
DON'T GET RABIES.
>> RABIES?

649
00:46:12,652 --> 00:46:16,361
I'M KIDDING, I'M KIDDING, I'M
KIDDING, I'M KIDDING.

650
00:46:16,361 --> 00:46:19,660
RABIES IS THE LAST THING YOU
NEED TO WORRY ABOUT GETTING FROM
ME.

651
00:46:19,660 --> 00:46:21,342
>> OKAY.

652
00:46:23,050 --> 00:46:26,580
>> ALL RIGHT, COME ON, COLIN.
LET'S GO BACK TO MY DUMPSTER,

653
00:46:26,580 --> 00:46:30,611
AND I'LL RIDE YOUR HEAD LIKE A
DAVY CROCKETT HAT.

654
00:46:30,611 --> 00:46:33,674
>> THE DRUNK RACCOON, EVERYONE!

655
00:46:34,222 --> 00:46:36,247
FOR "WEEKEND UPDATE," I'M COLIN
JOST.

656
00:46:36,247 --> 00:46:39,616
CHE

PARTY

658
00:47:06,499 --> 00:47:08,864
YOU CAN HEAD UP THERE WITH YOUR
SLEEPING BAG.

659
00:47:08,864 --> 00:47:10,810
UNLESS YOU'D RATHER HANG WITH
THE MOMS.

660
00:47:10,810 --> 00:47:14,477
>> OKAY.
THANKS, MRS. CONNELLY.

661
00:47:14,477 --> 00:47:18,120
>> AWW, SO CUTE!

662
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:22,666
WELL, CHEERS, GALS, SO GOOD TO
HANG WITH YOU.
I CAN'T WAIT TO TRY THESE
SNACKS.

663
00:47:22,666 --> 00:47:25,313
>> OKAY.

664
00:47:25,313 --> 00:47:28,728
>> SO WHAT DO YOU ALL THINK THE
GIRLS ARE GETTING UP TO
UPSTAIRS?

665
00:47:28,728 --> 00:47:31,467
>> I BET THEY'RE PLAYING "TRUTH
OR DARE."

666
00:47:31,467 --> 00:47:35,601
>> YOU KNOW WHAT?
GET THIS.
I HAVE NEVER PLAYED "TRUTH OR
DARE."

667
00:47:35,601 --> 00:47:37,876

682
00:48:15,862 --> 00:48:18,799

GAME IS INTERESTING AND FUN.

690
00:48:50,465 --> 00:48:52,181
I WAS THINKING THE SAME THING.

691
00:48:52,181 --> 00:48:55,007

THAT WOULD BE NICE, BUT WE'D
HAVE TO GET A SITTER.

758
00:52:17,579 --> 00:52:21,761

780

BECAUSE I'M EMBARRASSED I GOT

787
00:53:50,044 --> 00:53:52,011
TOO EXCITED ABOUT SUNDAY SUPPER.

788

789
00:53:52,713 --> 00:53:55,648
SUNDAY SUPPER.

790
00:53:55,650 --> 00:53:57,449

DRESS-UP BOX.

807
00:54:27,682 --> 00:54:29,315
>> YOU HAVE A DRESS-UP BOX?

808

809
00:54:30,451 --> 00:54:34,186
IT'S TO PLAY MAKE BELIEVE.

810

812
00:54:36,223 --> 00:54:37,723
HAS HE EVER RUN AWAY BEFORE?

813

NITRIDE TO HOP A FREIGHT TRAIN.

818
00:54:47,335 --> 00:54:49,134
HE GOT SCARED BECAUSE SOMEBODY

819
00:54:49,136 --> 00:54:50,402
OFFERED HIM CRACK.

820
00:54:50,805 --> 00:54:51,403

>> YEAH, MAYBE WE COULD DO

831
00:55:15,529 --> 00:55:16,195
SOMETHING THAT'S LESS OF A

832
00:55:16,197 --> 00:55:18,097
COMMITMENT.

833
00:55:18,099 --> 00:55:20,065

842
00:55:31,579 --> 00:55:32,411
I GOT TO GO.

843
00:55:32,413 --> 00:55:33,679

00:55:33,681 --> 00:55:37,616
COME ON.

845
00:55:37,952 --> 00:55:38,684
>> I DON'T BELONG IN THIS WORLD,

846
00:55:38,686 --> 00:55:38,984
SUGAR.

847
00:55:40,187 --> 00:55:42,287
I BELONG OUT THERE.

848
00:55:42,289 --> 00:55:45,391
ON THE TRACKS.

849
00:55:45,393 --> 00:55:45,958
>> WHERE WILL YOU GO?

850
00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:49,194
WHAT WILL YOU DO?

851
00:55:49,196 --> 00:55:51,163
>> I'LL BEFRIEND A LARGE, SIMPLE

852
00:55:51,165 --> 00:55:51,563
MAN.

853
00:55:51,565 --> 00:55:54,032
AND AT THE END OF THE STORY,

854
00:55:54,034 --> 00:55:54,733
I'LL SHOOT HIM IN THE BACK OF

855
00:55:54,735 --> 00:55:55,100
THE HEAD.

856
00:55:56,804 --> 00:55:57,536
BUT IT WILL BE THE RIGHT THING

857
00:55:57,538 --> 00:56:00,572
TO DO.

858
00:56:00,574 --> 00:56:02,541
BECAUSE HE HAS RABIES.

859
00:56:02,543 --> 00:56:04,076
>> I THINK YOU GOT YOUR

860
00:56:04,078 --> 00:56:06,412
REFERENCES MIXED UP THERE, MARK.

861
00:56:06,414 --> 00:56:08,981
>> I'LL ALWAYS LOVE YOU.

862
00:56:08,983 --> 00:56:12,317
BUT NOW I GOT TO GO, BECAUSE I'M

863
00:56:12,319 --> 00:56:15,187
EMBARRASSED I GOT TOO EXCITED

GOOD-BYE.

867
00:56:21,328 --> 00:56:24,196

868
00:56:24,198 --> 00:56:24,930
DO YOU THINK WE'LL EVER SEE HIM

869
00:56:24,932 --> 00:56:26,965
AGAIN?

870
00:56:26,967 --> 00:56:27,833
>> I HOPE NOT.

871
00:56:32,506 --> 00:56:33,205
BECAUSE HE IS A BURDEN ON MY

872

LIFE.

873
00:56:36,944 --> 00:56:37,643
