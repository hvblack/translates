FIRST THINGS FIRST.
WHERE ARE THE FATTIES?

13
00:00:54,099 --> 00:00:56,897

YOU THINK YOU'RE HIDING UNDER
THAT BLAZER, PORKY?

15
00:01:00,697 --> 00:01:03,765
WHO DO YOU WRITE FOR, "THE
CHICAGO TROMBONE"?

16
00:01:03,765 --> 00:01:07,904
THAT'S WHAT THEY PLAY WHEN YOUR
FAT ASS WALKS AROUND.

17
00:01:07,904 --> 00:01:12,423
LISTEN UP.
AS YOU PROBABLY READ IN SOME GAY
NEWSPAPER,

18
00:01:12,423 --> 00:01:15,074
 WE'RE NOW AT WAR WITH
VENEZUELA.

OH, YOU NERDS ARE LIKE, WAIT,

SUPERFINGER, DANE COOK.

PRETEND I'M A RANDOM FISHING BOAT AND
FIRE AWAY.

24
00:01:32,216 --> 00:01:37,304
>> OKAY.
IS THERE ANY TRUTH TO THE
ALLEGATIONS 

25
00:01:37,304 --> 00:01:40,633
THAT AFTER AN
INITIAL STRIKE ON A DRUG
SMUGGLING BOAT, 

26
00:01:40,633 --> 00:01:44,627
YOU ORDERED A
SECOND STRIKE TO KILL THE
SURVIVORS?

27
00:01:44,627 --> 00:01:47,856
>> UH, FIRST OF ALL, THAT KIND
OF CRUEL, HEARTLESS ACT

28
00:01:47,856 --> 00:01:51,366
 HAS NO
PLACE IN "OPERATION KILL
EVERYBODY."

29
00:01:51,366 --> 00:01:54,422
SECOND, I WASN'T EVEN IN THE
ROOM WHEN IT HAPPENED, OKAY?

30
00:01:54,422 --> 00:01:58,890
I WAS SO JACKED UP AFTER THE
FIRST STRIKE, I HAD TO MAKE AN
EMERGENCY CALL TO MY SPONSOR --

31
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:08,844

00:02:14,618 --> 00:02:15,484

00:02:24,328 --> 00:02:25,928
SENATOR MARK KELLY, WHO SAID YOU

42
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:28,730
ACT LIKE A 12-YEAR-OLD PLAYING

00:02:29,033 --> 00:02:30,732
>> KELLY, THAT'S A GIRL'S NAME.

45
00:02:30,734 --> 00:02:34,837

00:02:35,239 --> 00:02:36,438
IT'S MARK LIKE I SAID.

49
00:02:38,576 --> 00:02:39,575
>> I'M TRYING!

50
00:02:43,981 --> 00:02:45,581
>> TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION, IF I

51
00:02:45,583 --> 00:02:47,850
WAS JUST PLAYING ARMY, WOULD

52
00:02:47,852 --> 00:02:50,686
THERE BE 80 DEAD FISHERMEN --

53
00:02:50,688 --> 00:02:51,220
NARCOTERRORISTS?

54
00:02:51,222 --> 00:02:52,187
VENEZUELA RIGHT NOW?

55
00:02:52,189 --> 00:02:52,654
NEXT QUESTION.

56
00:02:52,656 --> 00:02:55,023
>> YEAH, SO IS 80 THE OFFICIAL

57
00:02:55,025 --> 00:02:55,691

>> IS 80 THE OFFICIAL -- NO,

59
00:02:58,095 --> 00:02:59,695
IT'S 6-7, 6-7.

60
00:02:59,697 --> 00:03:02,898
IDIOT.

61
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:04,433
LET'S JUST SAY IF I HAD A DRINK

62
00:03:04,435 --> 00:03:06,368
FOR EVERY VENEZUELAN WE'VE

63
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:07,069
KILLED, I'D REALLY LIKE THAT

64
00:03:07,071 --> 00:03:09,404
NUMBER OF DRINKS.

65
00:03:09,406 --> 00:03:10,572
ALL RIGHT, NEXT?

I'M A REPORTER NOW.

70
00:03:21,385 --> 00:03:21,750
QUESTION.

71
00:03:21,752 --> 00:03:22,517
YOU'RE ONLY KILLING PEOPLE WHO

72
00:03:22,519 --> 00:03:25,220
ARE TRAFFICKING DRUGS, RIGHT?

73
00:03:25,222 --> 00:03:26,855
SO HYPOTHETICALLY, IF SOMEONE

74
00:03:26,857 --> 00:03:27,522
WERE TRAFFICKING SOMETHING

75
00:03:27,524 --> 00:03:31,660
ELSE -- THEY'D BE OKAY?

76
00:03:31,662 --> 00:03:32,628
>> WE'RE TARGETING DRUG

77
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:35,964
SMUGGLERS EXCLUSIVELY.

78
00:03:35,966 --> 00:03:38,934
>> DIGGY, NO FURTHER QUESTIONS,

79
00:03:38,936 --> 00:03:39,468
YOUR HONOR.

80
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:40,469
>> I HAVE A QUESTION.

81
00:03:40,471 --> 00:03:41,236
>> OH, JESUS.

82
00:03:41,238 --> 00:03:44,806
YEAH, WILL & GRACE, GO.

83
00:03:45,209 --> 00:03:47,676

84
00:03:47,678 --> 00:03:47,976
GRACE.

85
00:03:47,978 --> 00:03:49,044
HOW DO YOU RESPOND TO THE

86
00:03:49,046 --> 00:03:50,846
ALLEGATIONS THAT THE SO-CALLED

87
00:03:50,848 --> 00:03:52,648
WAR ON SMUGGLERS IS A SMOKE

88
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:54,082
SCREEN FOR REGIME CHANGE?

89
00:03:54,084 --> 00:03:58,020
>> OH, WHOA, WAY TO SOLVE THE

90
00:03:58,022 --> 00:03:59,454
MYSTERY, SCOOB.

91
00:03:59,456 --> 00:04:00,355
OF COURSE THAT'S WHAT WE'RE

92
00:04:00,357 --> 00:04:01,590
DOING AND IT ALWAYS WORKS.

93
00:04:01,592 --> 00:04:04,860
JUST LIKE IT DID IN GUATEMALA,

94
00:04:04,862 --> 00:04:07,529
NICARAGUA, CUBA, BRAZIL,

95

PEOPLE ACCUSE YOU OF HAR CRIMES.

100
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:24,680
EVEN THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN

101
00:04:24,682 --> 00:04:25,447
DISTANCING HIMSELF FROM YOU.

102
00:04:25,449 --> 00:04:26,815
>> I HAVE A QUESTION FOR YOU,

103
00:04:26,817 --> 00:04:28,984
HAVE YOU EVER KISSED A GIRL?

104

ANYWAY, TO ANSWER YOUR

110
00:04:42,266 --> 00:04:43,332
QUESTION -- PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS

00:04:44,768 --> 00:04:47,035
YOU WANT TO KNOW WHY?

113
00:04:47,037 --> 00:04:51,106
UNLIKE YOU BETA CUCKS, HE'S A

00:04:51,108 --> 00:04:52,341
HIGH-ENERGY ALPHA WHO TRUSTS ME

WHAT, ISN'T THAT RIGHT, MR.

117
00:04:54,812 --> 00:04:55,177
PRESIDENT?

118
00:05:07,024 --> 00:05:11,860
>> STOP, MAMDANI!

119
00:05:11,862 --> 00:05:13,628
YOU CAN FREEZE MY RENT ANY TIME.

120
00:05:14,031 --> 00:05:15,230
I WASN'T SLEEPING.

121
00:05:15,232 --> 00:05:19,334
I'M VERY MUCH AWAKE.

122
00:05:19,336 --> 00:05:21,036
NOW SOMEONE QUICKLY TELL ME,

YEAR MIGHT IT BE?

125
00:05:24,375 --> 00:05:25,841
>> GOOD ONE, MR. PRESIDENT.

126
00:05:25,843 --> 00:05:26,575
EVERYTHING YOU DO THAT'S WEIRD,

127
00:05:26,577 --> 00:05:31,246
IT'S A JOKE.

128
00:05:31,648 --> 00:05:33,015
I WAS JUST TELLING EVERYONE THAT

129
00:05:33,017 --> 00:05:34,383
I HAD YOUR FULL SUPPORT.

130
00:05:34,385 --> 00:05:35,083
>> ABSOLUTELY.

131
00:05:35,085 --> 00:05:35,617
WE LOVE PETE.

132
00:05:35,619 --> 00:05:39,521
HE'S A GREAT GUY.

133
00:05:39,523 --> 00:05:40,856
HE WAS JUST FOG OF WAR, RIGHT?

134
00:05:40,858 --> 00:05:41,690
FOG OF WAR.

135
00:05:41,692 --> 00:05:43,125
IT'S A THING YOU ONLY SAY AFTER

136
00:05:43,127 --> 00:05:46,028
DOING WAR CRIME.

137
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:46,328
RIGHT?

138
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:47,963
YOU NEVER HEAR A GENERAL GO,

139
00:05:47,965 --> 00:05:48,697
"EVERYTHING WENT ACCORDING TO"

140
00:05:48,699 --> 00:05:51,400
PLAN IN FOG OF WAR."

141
00:05:51,402 --> 00:05:52,968
IT'S LIKE WHEN YOU GO INTO THE

142
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:54,870
SAUNA AT EQUINOX AND SUDDENLY

143
00:05:54,872 --> 00:05:55,604
YOU'RE DOING STUFF YOU NEVER DID

144
00:05:55,606 --> 00:05:55,937
BEFORE.

145
00:05:56,673 --> 00:05:59,307
FOG OF WAR.

146
00:05:59,309 --> 00:06:00,709
FOG OF WAR, WE LOVE IT.

147
00:06:00,711 --> 00:06:02,477
IT'S A GREAT NEW EXCUSE, WE LOVE

148
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:02,744
IT.

149
00:06:02,746 --> 00:06:04,212
SO I STAND BY PETE.

150
00:06:04,214 --> 00:06:05,747
AND NOTHING CAN CHANGE MY MIND.

151
00:06:05,749 --> 00:06:06,948
UNLESS, OF COURSE, IT COULD HURT

152
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:08,016
ME IN ANY WAY.

153
00:06:08,018 --> 00:06:10,385
IN WHICH I WAS, I'LL THROW HIM

154
00:06:10,387 --> 00:06:13,622
UNDER MUST HAVE MAMDANI'S FREE

155
00:06:13,624 --> 00:06:13,922
BUSES.

156
00:06:16,493 --> 00:06:17,059
>> I HAVE A QUESTION.

157
00:06:17,061 --> 00:06:17,793
MR. PRESIDENT, MORE AMERICANS

158
00:06:17,795 --> 00:06:18,560

WHAT'S YOUR MESSAGE TO THEM?

162
00:06:27,504 --> 00:06:29,871
>> SHH, HE'S SLEEPING.

163
00:06:29,873 --> 00:06:32,074
WE GOT TO GET HIM TO ANOTHER MRI

164
00:06:32,076 --> 00:06:32,974
BEFORE HE WAKES UP.

165
00:06:32,976 --> 00:06:33,675
AND LIVE FROM NEW YORK, IT'S

SPEAKING OF MUSIC, THERE'S

186
00:09:51,575 --> 00:09:53,141
SOMETHING MOST PEOPLE DON'T KNOW

187
00:09:53,143 --> 00:09:54,276
ABOUT ME.

188
00:09:54,278 --> 00:09:57,012
IS THAT I AM A MUSICIAN.

189
00:09:57,014 --> 00:09:59,247
AND MY INSTRUMENT -- AND MY

190
00:09:59,249 --> 00:09:59,948
INSTRUMENT IS THE MOUTH HORN.

191
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:01,683
THAT'S RIGHT.

192
00:10:01,685 --> 00:10:04,686
IT'S THE MOUTH HORN.

193
00:10:04,688 --> 00:10:06,488
AND I'M A BIT NERVOUS, BUT --

194
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:07,155
MAYBE IF WE BRING DOWN THE

195
00:10:07,157 --> 00:10:09,057
LIGHTS?

196
00:10:09,059 --> 00:10:09,824

211
00:10:58,975 --> 00:10:59,708

AH, COME ON.

214
00:11:05,449 --> 00:11:06,715

BEST HUG I'VE EVER HAD.

00:17:09,896 --> 00:17:12,397
I MEAN, NOT JUST BECAUSE IT'S MY

384
00:17:12,399 --> 00:17:12,997
FIRST HUG, WHICH IT WAS.

385
00:17:12,999 --> 00:17:15,166
IT WAS REALLY GOOD.

386
00:17:15,168 --> 00:17:17,034
>> HI, MA'AM.

387
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:17,802
DO YOU HAVE A DOG TIED UP IN THE

388
00:17:17,804 --> 00:17:20,304
FRONT OF THE STORE?

389
00:17:20,306 --> 00:17:21,172
>> YOU GOT TO BE MORE SPECIFIC

390
00:17:21,174 --> 00:17:21,539
THAN THAT.

391
00:17:23,443 --> 00:17:25,877
>> OKAY, DO YOU HAVE SIX DOGS

392
00:17:25,879 --> 00:17:27,245
TIED UP OUTSIDE?

393
00:17:27,247 --> 00:17:28,446
>> LET'S SEE.

394
00:17:28,448 --> 00:17:29,947
FOUR, FIVE, SIX -- YEAH, THOSE

395
00:17:29,949 --> 00:17:31,816

396
00:17:31,818 --> 00:17:32,550
>> OKAY, WELL, THEY'RE BARKING

397
00:17:32,552 --> 00:17:33,084
AT PEOPLE OF COLOR.

398
00:17:35,121 --> 00:17:36,254
AND ONE BIT THE SALVATION ARMY

399
00:17:36,256 --> 00:17:38,956
BELL RINGER.

400
00:17:38,958 --> 00:17:40,291
SO COULD YOU PLEASE GO ATTEND TO

401
00:17:40,293 --> 00:17:40,591
THEM?

402
00:17:40,593 --> 00:17:41,793
>> WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT?

403
00:17:41,795 --> 00:17:45,229
WHY DON'T YOU JUST -- RIGHT?

404
00:17:45,231 --> 00:17:46,998
WHY DON'T YOU JUST UNTIE THEM

405
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
AND LET THEM RUN OFF.

406
00:17:49,636 --> 00:17:49,934
RIGHT?

407
00:17:49,936 --> 00:17:51,169
BECAUSE THEY'VE BECOME A DRAIN

408
00:17:51,171 --> 00:17:51,836
TO US.

409
00:17:51,838 --> 00:17:52,870
AND OUR FINANCES.

410
00:17:52,872 --> 00:17:55,573
AND JUST A BURDEN TO US.

411
00:17:55,575 --> 00:17:56,941

412
00:17:56,943 --> 00:17:57,375
KNOW HER.

413
00:17:57,377 --> 00:17:58,843
>> DO YOU WANT ME TO UNTIE YOUR

414
00:17:58,845 --> 00:18:01,245
DOGS AND LET THEM RUN AWAY?

415
00:18:01,247 --> 00:18:01,813
>> I DON'T KNOW YOU.

416
00:18:01,815 --> 00:18:04,348
>> YES.

417
00:18:04,751 --> 00:18:05,616
WHAT DID YOU SAY?

418
00:18:05,618 --> 00:18:06,684
>> I DON'T KNOW YOU.

419
00:18:06,686 --> 00:18:08,019
>> HE SAID, TAKE THEIR COLLARS

420
00:18:08,021 --> 00:18:09,854
OFF SO THEY CAN'T BE BROUGHT

421
00:18:09,856 --> 00:18:10,988
BACK TO US.

422
00:18:11,391 --> 00:18:13,057
>> I'M NOT GOING TO DO THAT, SO

423
00:18:13,059 --> 00:18:13,724
PLEASE ATTEND TO YOUR DOGS.

424
00:18:13,726 --> 00:18:17,428
>> OKAY.

425
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:17,795
>> OKAY.

426
00:18:17,797 --> 00:18:20,665
>> ALL RIGHT, WELL -- DUTY

427
00:18:20,667 --> 00:18:20,998
CALLS.

428

BUT BEFORE I GO, I JUST REALLY

429
00:18:23,703 --> 00:18:24,635
WANTED TO REPAY YOUR KINDNESS.

430
00:18:24,637 --> 00:18:26,637
>> OH!

431
00:18:37,984 --> 00:18:42,420
>> WAIT!

432
00:19:17,055 --> 00:19:30,801

IT'S A REAL GUN!

452
00:20:49,215 --> 00:20:52,149
WHO GAVE THIS TO YOU?

453
00:20:53,586 --> 00:20:54,385

463
00:21:17,477 --> 00:21:18,476
SORT OF MISTAKE.

WE CAN HEAT THE ATM UP.

480
00:21:42,702 --> 00:21:44,268
AS A MATTER OF FACT, I'M GOING

ACROSS THE STREET?

493
00:22:09,729 --> 00:22:10,494
>> NO, WE DIDN'T REALLY KNOW

494
00:22:10,496 --> 00:22:11,228
HER.

495
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:11,962
WHY, WHAT HAPPENED?

496
00:22:11,964 --> 00:22:13,731
DID SHE PASS AWAY?

497
00:22:13,733 --> 00:22:16,600
>> NO, HER MOTHER DID, THOUGH.

498
00:22:16,602 --> 00:22:17,334
SIX YEARS AGO.

499
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:18,602
WE JUST FOUND HER BODY

500
00:22:18,604 --> 00:22:19,603
DECOMPOSED INTO THE COUCH.

501
00:22:19,605 --> 00:22:21,605
>> JESUS.

502
00:22:21,607 --> 00:22:22,840
>> WE STILL THINK THE SICKO IS

503
00:22:22,842 --> 00:22:24,108
IN THE AREA, SO IF YOU SEE HER,

504
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:27,878
GIVE US A CALL IMMEDIATELY.

505
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:31,949
OH, NICE SNOWMAN, BY THE WAY.

506
00:22:34,487 --> 00:22:36,253
>> OFFICER, I SAW HER.

>> YOU KNOW -- I'LL BE HONEST.

548

578
00:25:46,028 --> 00:25:47,528
IF YOU FAINTED, HOW CAN YOU DO

579
00:25:47,530 --> 00:25:48,662

589
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:04,511
FAINT.

590
00:26:04,513 --> 00:26:05,179
>> DONNA, THIS IS SERIOUS.

591
00:26:05,181 --> 00:26:08,148
YOU BROKE THE LAW.

592
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:11,518

ACTUALLY, I'M ED'S SUPERIOR.

598
00:26:19,428 --> 00:26:21,595
AND YOU BROKE A FEW LAWS,

599
00:26:21,597 --> 00:26:21,962
ACTUALLY.

600
00:26:21,964 --> 00:26:23,030
BECAUSE YOU CAME BACK LATER, AND

601
00:26:23,032 --> 00:26:23,931
YOU WERE QUITE BUSY.

602
00:26:23,933 --> 00:26:31,038

00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,706
>> LOOK.

604
00:26:32,708 --> 00:26:35,609
DUMPING OUT THE TRASH, I'M

605
00:26:35,611 --> 00:26:36,010
RECYCLING.

606
00:26:36,012 --> 00:26:41,181
>> YOU'RE NOT RECYCLING.

607
00:26:41,183 --> 00:26:42,349
DESTROYED A GARDEN POT.

608
00:26:42,351 --> 00:26:45,185
YOU PUT A LIVE BAT IN THEIR

609
00:26:45,187 --> 00:26:45,519
HOUSE.

610
00:26:45,521 --> 00:26:47,221
>> THAT WAS A BAT RESCUE, I

611
00:26:47,223 --> 00:26:47,788
RESCUED THAT BAT.

612
00:26:47,790 --> 00:26:49,223
>> IT WAS NOT A BAT RESCUE.

613
00:26:49,225 --> 00:26:51,258
>> IT WAS A BAT RESCUE.

614
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:53,293
LOOK, YOU KNOW -- IT WAS AWHILE

615
00:26:53,295 --> 00:26:53,994
AGO, OKAY?

616
00:26:53,996 --> 00:26:55,329
IT'S OUT OF MY SYSTEM NOW.

617
00:26:55,331 --> 00:26:56,330
AND I'VE MOVED ON.

618
00:26:56,332 --> 00:26:57,131

00:27:11,914 --> 00:27:13,447
>> NO.

625
00:27:13,449 --> 00:27:15,049
>> IT'S NOT MY FAULT, OKAY?

626
00:27:15,051 --> 00:27:15,916
I'M A HUMAN BEING, I HAD TO GO,

627
00:27:15,918 --> 00:27:18,018
AND I COULDN'T HOLD IT.

628
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:22,356

YOU CAN'T TRUST THAT VIDEO.

00:27:40,776 --> 00:27:41,975
DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING IN WRITING?

641
00:27:41,977 --> 00:27:43,210
I'D LIKE TO SEE THE COMPLAINT IN

642
00:27:43,212 --> 00:27:43,644
THE FLESH.
