00:00:01,719 --> 00:00:03,446
>>> YOU'RE WATCHING C-SPAN.

2
00:00:03,446 --> 00:00:05,663
HEY, NETFLIX, WE'RE FOR SALE,
TOO.

3
00:00:05,663 --> 00:00:10,749
WE NOW GO TO THE PENTAGON FOR A
PRESS CONFERENCE WITH THE
SECRETARY OF DEFENSE.

4
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:16,687
>> LADIES AND GENTLEMEN OF THE PRESS,
AS YOU KNOW THERE HAVE BEEN CONCERNS

5
00:00:16,687 --> 00:00:20,223
ABOUT ONGOING
MILITARY ACTION OFF THE COAST OF
VENEZUELA.

6
00:00:20,223 --> 00:00:24,665
HERE TO ANSWER ALL YOUR
QUESTIONS IN A CALM,
NONAGGRESSIVE FASHION

7
00:00:24,665 --> 00:00:31,309

8
00:00:40,362 --> 00:00:41,997
>> YEAH!

9
00:00:41,997 --> 00:00:45,344
SHUT THE HELL UP, SHUT UP, CUT
THE MUSIC.

10
00:00:45,344 --> 00:00:46,993
WHAT?

11
00:00:46,993 --> 00:00:51,258
FIRST THINGS FIRST.
WHERE ARE THE FATTIES?

12
00:00:51,258 --> 00:00:54,099
YOU, OUT.

13
00:00:54,099 --> 00:00:56,897
>> WHAT?
I'M NOT EVEN FAT.

14
00:00:56,897 --> 00:01:00,697
>> BOO, REALLY?
YOU THINK YOU'RE HIDING UNDER
THAT BLAZER, PORKY?

15
00:01:00,697 --> 00:01:03,765
WHO DO YOU WRITE FOR, "THE
CHICAGO TROMBONE"?

16
00:01:03,765 --> 00:01:07,904
THAT'S WHAT THEY PLAY WHEN YOUR
FAT ASS WALKS AROUND.

17
00:01:07,904 --> 00:01:12,423
LISTEN UP.
AS YOU PROBABLY READ IN SOME GAY
NEWSPAPER,

18
00:01:12,423 --> 00:01:15,074
WE'RE NOW AT WAR WITH
VENEZUELA.

19
00:01:15,074 --> 00:01:18,775
OH, YOU NERDS ARE LIKE, WAIT,
WAS THERE AN OFFICIAL
DECLARATION OF WAR?

20
00:01:18,775 --> 00:01:20,363
YEAH, IT'S RIGHT HERE.

21
00:01:20,363 --> 00:01:23,799
SUPERFINGER, DANE COOK.

22
00:01:25,125 --> 00:01:27,741
YOU GOT QUESTIONS, FINE,

23
00:01:27,741 --> 00:01:31,723
PRETEND I'M A RANDOM FISHING BOAT AND
FIRE AWAY.

24
00:01:32,216 --> 00:01:37,304
>> OKAY.
IS THERE ANY TRUTH TO THE
ALLEGATIONS

25
00:01:37,304 --> 00:01:40,633
THAT AFTER AN
INITIAL STRIKE ON A DRUG
SMUGGLING BOAT,

26
00:01:40,633 --> 00:01:44,627
YOU ORDERED A
SECOND STRIKE TO KILL THE
SURVIVORS?

27
00:01:44,627 --> 00:01:47,856
>> UH, FIRST OF ALL, THAT KIND
OF CRUEL, HEARTLESS ACT

28
00:01:47,856 --> 00:01:51,366
HAS NO
PLACE IN "OPERATION KILL
EVERYBODY."

29
00:01:51,366 --> 00:01:54,422
SECOND, I WASN'T EVEN IN THE
ROOM WHEN IT HAPPENED, OKAY?

30
00:01:54,422 --> 00:01:58,890
I WAS SO JACKED UP AFTER THE
FIRST STRIKE, I HAD TO MAKE AN
EMERGENCY CALL TO MY SPONSOR --

31
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:02,413
SORRY, A GUY I MET IN AN ONUS IN MEETING --

32
00:02:02,413 --> 00:02:05,583
SO I DON'T DRINK
SOMETHING --
¶ THAT I LIKE

33
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:08,605
BUT I CAN'T HAVE BUT I WANT IT
BUT I NEED IT AND I WANT IT RIGHT NOW

34
00:02:08,722 --> 00:02:11,515
BUP BUP BUP IT'S
BOOZE ¶

35
00:02:13,224 --> 00:02:15,000
NEXT QUESTION?

36
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,738
>> YES, WHAT DID YOU SAY TO
SENATOR MARK KELLY,

37
00:02:17,738 --> 00:02:21,008
WHO SAID YOU
ACT LIKE A 12-YEAR-OLD PLAYING
ARMY?

38
00:02:21,008 --> 00:02:23,993
>> KELLY, THAT'S A GIRL'S NAME.

39
00:02:23,993 --> 00:02:27,099
WHAT'S HIS FIRST NAME, DRESS?

40
00:02:27,099 --> 00:02:30,769
>> NO.
IT'S MARK LIKE I SAID.

41
00:02:30,769 --> 00:02:33,497
>> OH, GET A HUSBAND.

42
00:02:33,497 --> 00:02:36,496
>> I'M TRYING!

43
00:02:36,496 --> 00:02:40,005
>> TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION, IF I
WAS JUST PLAYING ARMY,

44
00:02:40,005 --> 00:02:41,912
WOULD
THERE BE 80 DEAD FISHERMEN --

45
00:02:41,912 --> 00:02:45,124
NARCOTERRORISTS?
VENEZUELA RIGHT NOW?

46
00:02:45,124 --> 00:02:46,270
NEXT QUESTION.

47
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:49,167
>> YEAH, SO IS 80 THE OFFICIAL
DEATH TOLL?

48
00:02:49,167 --> 00:02:51,298
>> IS 80 THE OFFICIAL --

49
00:02:51,298 --> 00:02:54,838
NO, IT'S 6-7, 6-7.

50
00:02:54,838 --> 00:02:56,794
IDIOT.

51
00:02:56,794 --> 00:03:00,343
LET'S JUST SAY IF I HAD A DRINK
FOR EVERY VENEZUELAN WE'VE KILLED,

52
00:03:00,343 --> 00:03:03,149
I'D REALLY LIKE THAT
NUMBER OF DRINKS.

53
00:03:03,149 --> 00:03:07,348
ALL RIGHT, NEXT?
OH, MY GOD, IS THAT MATT GAETZ?

54
00:03:08,268 --> 00:03:11,622
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
IT'S ME, MATT GAETZ.

55
00:03:11,622 --> 00:03:14,016
I'M A REPORTER NOW.

56
00:03:14,016 --> 00:03:19,131
QUESTION.
YOU'RE ONLY KILLING PEOPLE WHO
ARE TRAFFICKING DRUGS, RIGHT?

57
00:03:19,131 --> 00:03:22,743
SO HYPOTHETICALLY, IF SOMEONE
WERE TRAFFICKING SOMETHING ELSE --

58
00:03:22,743 --> 00:03:25,125
THEY'D BE OKAY?

59
00:03:25,526 --> 00:03:29,123
>> WE'RE TARGETING DRUG
SMUGGLERS EXCLUSIVELY.

60
00:03:29,123 --> 00:03:32,948
>> DIGGY, NO FURTHER QUESTIONS,
YOUR HONOR.

61
00:03:32,948 --> 00:03:36,029
>> I HAVE A QUESTION.
>> OH, JESUS.

62
00:03:36,029 --> 00:03:38,714
YEAH, WILL & GRACE, GO.

63
00:03:38,714 --> 00:03:41,742
>> MY NAME IS ACTUALLY WILLIAM
GRACE.

64
00:03:41,742 --> 00:03:46,109
HOW DO YOU RESPOND TO THE
ALLEGATIONS THAT THE SO-CALLED
WAR ON SMUGGLERS

65
00:03:46,109 --> 00:03:48,300
IS A SMOKE
SCREEN FOR REGIME CHANGE?

66
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:52,363
>> OH, WHOA, WAY TO SOLVE THE
MYSTERY, SCOOB.

67
00:03:52,363 --> 00:03:55,699
OF COURSE THAT'S WHAT WE'RE
DOING AND IT ALWAYS WORKS.

68
00:03:55,699 --> 00:03:58,861
JUST LIKE IT DID IN GUATEMALA,
NICARAGUA,

69
00:03:58,861 --> 00:04:02,949
CUBA, BRAZIL,
BOLIVIA, PANAMA
¶ HAITI ELSALVADOR

70
00:04:02,949 --> 00:04:06,326
CHILI
HONDURAS PERU" ANIMANIACS!

71
00:04:07,334 --> 00:04:08,933
DONE

72
00:04:08,933 --> 00:04:11,651
NERDS

73
00:04:11,651 --> 00:04:15,127
>> SECRETARYING HE GET, SOME
PEOPLE ACCUSE YOU OF HAR CRIMES.

74
00:04:15,127 --> 00:04:17,436
EVEN THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN
DISTANCING HIMSELF FROM YOU.

75
00:04:17,436 --> 00:04:19,702
>> I HAVE A QUESTION FOR YOU,

76
00:04:19,702 --> 00:04:21,917
HAVE YOU EVER KISSED A GIRL?

77
00:04:21,917 --> 00:04:24,888
I'M GENUINELY ASKING.

78
00:04:24,888 --> 00:04:26,946
>> I HAVE A WIFE.

79
00:04:26,946 --> 00:04:31,323
>> OKAY, SEND HERMES WAY WHEN
SHE WANTS TO ACTUALLY FEEL
SOMETHING.

80
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:39,275
ANYWAY, TO ANSWER YOUR
QUESTION -- PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS
MY BACK 100%.

81
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:42,025
YOU WANT TO KNOW WHY?
UNLIKE YOU BETA CUCKS,

82
00:04:42,025 --> 00:04:46,845
HE'S A
HIGH-ENERGY ALPHA WHO TRUSTS ME
AND LISTENS TO ME NO MATTER WHAT,

83
00:04:46,845 --> 00:04:49,840
ISN'T THAT RIGHT, MR.
PRESIDENT?

84
00:04:56,444 --> 00:05:00,981
>> STOP, MAMDANI!

85
00:05:01,791 --> 00:05:05,745
YOU CAN FREEZE MY RENT ANY TIME.

86
00:05:07,208 --> 00:05:10,927
I WASN'T SLEEPING.
I'M VERY MUCH AWAKE.

87
00:05:10,927 --> 00:05:12,973
NOW SOMEONE QUICKLY TELL ME,

88
00:05:12,973 --> 00:05:17,718
WHERE AM I, WHO MY, AND WHAT
YEAR MIGHT IT BE?

89
00:05:17,718 --> 00:05:19,792
>> GOOD ONE, MR. PRESIDENT.

90
00:05:19,792 --> 00:05:23,095
EVERYTHING YOU DO THAT'S WEIRD,
IT'S A JOKE.

91
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:28,624
I WAS JUST TELLING EVERYONE THAT
I HAD YOUR FULL SUPPORT.

92
00:05:28,624 --> 00:05:30,555
>> ABSOLUTELY.
WE LOVE PETE.

93
00:05:30,555 --> 00:05:34,313
HE'S A GREAT GUY.
HE WAS JUST FOG OF WAR, RIGHT?

94
00:05:34,313 --> 00:05:37,452
FOG OF WAR.
IT'S A THING YOU ONLY SAY

95
00:05:37,452 --> 00:05:39,714
AFTER
DOING WAR CRIME.

96
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:41,974
RIGHT?
YOU NEVER HEAR A GENERAL GO,

97
00:05:41,974 --> 00:05:45,434
"EVERYTHING WENT ACCORDING TO
PLAN IN FOG OF WAR."

98
00:05:45,434 --> 00:05:48,317
IT'S LIKE WHEN YOU GO INTO THE
SAUNA AT EQUINOX

99
00:05:48,317 --> 00:05:51,465
AND SUDDENLY
YOU'RE DOING STUFF YOU NEVER DID
BEFORE.

100
00:05:51,465 --> 00:05:54,822
FOG OF WAR.
FOG OF WAR, WE LOVE IT.

101
00:05:54,822 --> 00:05:56,738
IT'S A GREAT NEW EXCUSE, WE LOVE
IT.

102
00:05:56,738 --> 00:06:00,014
SO I STAND BY PETE.
AND NOTHING CAN CHANGE MY MIND.

103
00:06:00,014 --> 00:06:02,241
UNLESS, OF COURSE, IT COULD HURT
ME IN ANY WAY.

104
00:06:02,241 --> 00:06:06,680
IN WHICH I WAS, I'LL THROW HIM
UNDER MUST HAVE MAMDANI'S FREE
BUSES.

105
00:06:06,681 --> 00:06:08,254
FINAL

106
00:06:08,254 --> 00:06:12,267
>> I HAVE A QUESTION.
MR. PRESIDENT, MORE AMERICANS
INCLUDING YOUR OWN VOTERS

107
00:06:12,267 --> 00:06:14,774
BLAME
YOU FOR THE AFFORDABILITY
CRISIS.

108
00:06:14,774 --> 00:06:17,337
WHAT'S YOUR MESSAGE TO THEM?

109
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:22,830
>> SHH, HE'S SLEEPING.

110
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:26,700
WE GOT TO GET HIM TO ANOTHER MRI
BEFORE HE WAKES UP.

111
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:30,781
AND LIVE FROM NEW YORK, IT'S
SATURDAY NIGHT!

112
00:08:34,001 --> 00:08:37,761
MUSICAL

113
00:08:38,398 --> 00:08:43,590
HOST

114
00:08:46,006 --> 00:08:51,861
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN -- MELISSA
McCARTHY!

115
00:09:14,297 --> 00:09:18,358
>> THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK
YOU VERY MUCH.

116
00:09:18,358 --> 00:09:21,765
IT IS SO GREAT TO BE HERE
HOSTING "SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE"

117
00:09:21,765 --> 00:09:24,060
FOR THE SIXTH TIME.

118
00:09:25,915 --> 00:09:29,720
ALSO, DURING THE HOLIDAYS.
I MEAN, COME ON, PINCH ME.

119
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:32,046
THERE'S NOTHING BETTER THAN
CHRISTMAS IN NEW YORK.

120
00:09:32,046 --> 00:09:35,724
THIS SPECIAL TIME OF YEAR.
IT'S ABOUT FAMILY AND FRIENDS

121
00:09:35,724 --> 00:09:37,663
AND CLASSIC CHRISTMAS MUSIC.

122
00:09:37,663 --> 00:09:40,421
COME ON, SET THE MOOD, GANG.

123
00:09:40,421 --> 00:09:42,685
OH, THAT'S NICE.

124
00:09:42,685 --> 00:09:46,611
SPEAKING OF MUSIC, THERE'S
SOMETHING MOST PEOPLE DON'T KNOW
ABOUT ME.

125
00:09:46,611 --> 00:09:49,893
IS THAT I AM A MUSICIAN.

126
00:09:49,893 --> 00:09:54,976
AND MY INSTRUMENT -- AND MY
INSTRUMENT IS THE MOUTH HORN.

127
00:09:54,976 --> 00:09:58,179
THAT'S RIGHT.
IT'S THE MOUTH HORN.

128
00:09:58,179 --> 00:10:00,746
AND I'M A BIT NERVOUS, BUT --

129
00:10:00,746 --> 00:10:03,086
MAYBE IF WE BRING DOWN THE
LIGHTS?

130
00:10:03,154 --> 00:10:07,122
I CAN GIVE YOU A LITTLE TASTE OF
CHRISTMAS.

131
00:10:29,964 --> 00:10:33,394
>> SOAK IT UP, SOAK IT UP, THANK
YOU.

132
00:10:33,394 --> 00:10:37,490
OH, MY GOSH, YOU'RE AMAZING.
JUST SAY NICE THINGS TO ME.

133
00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:39,878
OH, I LOVE THIS TIME OF YEAR,
THOUGH.

134
00:10:39,878 --> 00:10:43,368
THE TREE IS LIT AND SANTA'S
CHECKING HIS LIST.

135
00:10:43,368 --> 00:10:47,997
HE'S GOT NAUGHTY AND NICE AND
EPSTEIN.

136
00:10:48,377 --> 00:10:51,259
WE COULD ALL USE A LITTLE
CHRISTMAS MAGIC.

137
00:10:51,259 --> 00:10:55,350
SO HOW ABOUT WE PUT A LITTLE BIT
OF SNOW TO GET US IN THE HOLIDAY
MOOD?

138
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:58,877
AH, COME ON.
SNL

139
00:10:58,877 --> 00:11:01,387
DON'T BE STINGY WITH THE SNOW.

140
00:11:01,387 --> 00:11:05,314
ALL RIGHT?
HERE IT IS.

141
00:11:08,532 --> 00:11:12,728
THAT IS TOO MUCH!
THAT IS TOO MUCH!

142
00:11:12,728 --> 00:11:14,541
I'LL TAKE IT.

143
00:11:14,541 --> 00:11:17,747
YOU KNOW, THE HOLIDAYS ARE
ALWAYS SENTIMENTAL FOR ME.

144
00:11:17,747 --> 00:11:21,477
THERE'S THE CLASSIC PAIRINGS.
COOKIES AND MILK.

145
00:11:21,477 --> 00:11:23,148
HAM AND GLAZE.

146
00:11:23,148 --> 00:11:27,885
AND EVERYBODY'S FAVORITE.
MOUTH HORN AND A PIANO DUET.

147
00:11:27,885 --> 00:11:31,350
I SHOULD HAVE ASKED SANTA NOR A
PIANO -- BUT

148
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:34,817
WAIT A MINUTE.
LOOKS LIKE I JUST GOT MY WISH.

149
00:11:34,817 --> 00:11:37,444
WHEN I WAS A LITTLE GIRL, MY
FAVORITE SONG WAS --

150
00:11:37,444 --> 00:11:40,259
OKAY, STOP.

I HAD TO COME BACK BECAUSE I --

206
00:15:16,435 --> 00:15:20,042
I JUST -- I CAN'T NOT REPAY YOUR
KINDNESS.

207

NOT MY BIOLOGICAL MOTHER, YOU

212
00:15:38,238 --> 00:15:40,271
KNOW, BECAUSE I WAS ABANDONED IN

213
00:15:40,273 --> 00:15:40,605

216
00:15:43,843 --> 00:15:44,909
MY FOSTER MOTHER WHO'S MY MOM TO

217
00:15:44,911 --> 00:15:47,011

00:15:55,655 --> 00:15:56,454
CAN.

225

ANYWAY, SHE WAS ALWAYS LIKE, I'M

00:16:04,197 --> 00:16:05,330
YOU'RE MY MOTHER BECAUSE YOU

00:16:05,332 --> 00:16:06,698
DON'T LET ME GO TO SCHOOL, SO I

232
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:13,571
DON'T HAVE ANYONE TO TALK TO!

233
00:16:13,573 --> 00:16:16,841

00:16:25,885 --> 00:16:26,317

>> WOW, SORRY -- SORRY ABOUT

244
00:16:32,025 --> 00:16:32,357

245
00:16:32,359 --> 00:16:36,828

00:17:09,896 --> 00:17:12,397
I MEAN, NOT JUST BECAUSE IT'S MY

265
00:17:12,399 --> 00:17:12,997
FIRST HUG, WHICH IT WAS.

266
00:17:12,999 --> 00:17:15,166
IT WAS REALLY GOOD.

267
00:17:15,168 --> 00:17:17,034
>> HI, MA'AM.

269
00:17:17,804 --> 00:17:20,304
FRONT OF THE STORE?

270
00:17:20,306 --> 00:17:21,172
>> YOU GOT TO BE MORE SPECIFIC

271
00:17:21,174 --> 00:17:21,539
THAN THAT.

272
00:17:23,443 --> 00:17:25,877
>> OKAY, DO YOU HAVE SIX DOGS

273
00:17:25,879 --> 00:17:27,245
TIED UP OUTSIDE?

274

>> OKAY, WELL, THEY'RE BARKING

278
00:17:32,552 --> 00:17:33,084
AT PEOPLE OF COLOR.

279
00:17:35,121 --> 00:17:36,254
AND ONE BIT THE SALVATION ARMY

280
00:17:36,256 --> 00:17:38,956
BELL RINGER.

281
00:17:38,958 --> 00:17:40,291
SO COULD YOU PLEASE GO ATTEND TO

282
00:17:40,293 --> 00:17:40,591
THEM?

283
00:17:40,593 --> 00:17:41,793
>> WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT?

284
00:17:41,795 --> 00:17:45,229
WHY DON'T YOU JUST -- RIGHT?

285
00:17:45,231 --> 00:17:46,998
WHY DON'T YOU JUST UNTIE THEM

286
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
AND LET THEM RUN OFF.

287
00:17:49,636 --> 00:17:49,934
RIGHT?

288
00:17:49,936 --> 00:17:51,169
BECAUSE THEY'VE BECOME A DRAIN

289
00:17:51,171 --> 00:17:51,836
TO US.

290
00:17:51,838 --> 00:17:52,870
AND OUR FINANCES.

291
00:17:52,872 --> 00:17:55,573
AND JUST A BURDEN TO US.

292
00:17:55,575 --> 00:17:56,941
>> I DON'T KNOW HER, I DON'T

293
00:17:56,943 --> 00:17:57,375
KNOW HER.

294
00:17:57,377 --> 00:17:58,843
>> DO YOU WANT ME TO UNTIE YOUR

295
00:17:58,845 --> 00:18:01,245
DOGS AND LET THEM RUN AWAY?

296
00:18:01,247 --> 00:18:01,813
>> I DON'T KNOW YOU.

297
00:18:01,815 --> 00:18:04,348
>> YES.

298
00:18:04,751 --> 00:18:05,616
WHAT DID YOU SAY?

299
00:18:05,618 --> 00:18:06,684
>> I DON'T KNOW YOU.

300
00:18:06,686 --> 00:18:08,019
>> HE SAID, TAKE THEIR COLLARS

301
00:18:08,021 --> 00:18:09,854
OFF SO THEY CAN'T BE BROUGHT

302
00:18:09,856 --> 00:18:10,988
BACK TO US.

303
00:18:11,391 --> 00:18:13,057
>> I'M NOT GOING TO DO THAT, SO

304
00:18:13,059 --> 00:18:13,724
PLEASE ATTEND TO YOUR DOGS.

305
00:18:13,726 --> 00:18:17,428
>> OKAY.

306
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:17,795
>> OKAY.

307
00:18:17,797 --> 00:18:20,665
>> ALL RIGHT, WELL -- DUTY

308
00:18:20,667 --> 00:18:20,998
CALLS.

309
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,701
BUT BEFORE I GO, I JUST REALLY

310
00:18:23,703 --> 00:18:24,635
WANTED TO REPAY YOUR KINDNESS.

311
00:18:24,637 --> 00:18:26,637
>> OH!

312
00:18:37,984 --> 00:18:42,420
>> WAIT!

313
00:19:17,055 --> 00:19:30,801
>> THANK YOU.

314
00:19:30,803 --> 00:19:33,004

IT'S TO PLAY MAKE BELIEVE.

1275

00:54:47,335 --> 00:54:49,134
HE GOT SCARED BECAUSE SOMEBODY

1284
00:54:49,136 --> 00:54:50,402
OFFERED HIM CRACK.

1285
00:54:50,805 --> 00:54:51,403

00:54:51,405 --> 00:54:53,672
DIFFERENT DAY.

1287

1294
00:55:11,192 --> 00:55:14,259
GASOLINE.

1295
00:55:14,261 --> 00:55:15,527
>> YEAH, MAYBE WE COULD DO

1296
00:55:15,529 --> 00:55:16,195
SOMETHING THAT'S LESS OF A

1297
00:55:16,197 --> 00:55:18,097
COMMITMENT.

1298
00:55:18,099 --> 00:55:20,065
>> HOW ABOUT BREAKFAST HERE

1299
00:55:20,067 --> 00:55:23,335
EVERY MORNING AT 6:00 A.M.?

1300
00:55:23,738 --> 00:55:25,437
>> NOT MORE OF A COMMITMENT,

1301
00:55:25,439 --> 00:55:25,738
MARK.

1302
00:55:25,740 --> 00:55:26,071
>> MARK!

1303
00:55:26,073 --> 00:55:27,840
NO, MARK!

1304
00:55:27,842 --> 00:55:28,707

1305
00:55:28,709 --> 00:55:29,141
>> STOP IT.

1306
00:55:29,143 --> 00:55:31,577
>> I'M SORRY, I'M SORRY.

1307
00:55:31,579 --> 00:55:32,411
I GOT TO GO.

1308
00:55:32,413 --> 00:55:33,679
>> NO, MARK, YOU CAN'T LEAVE ME,

1309
00:55:33,681 --> 00:55:37,616
COME ON.

1310
00:55:37,952 --> 00:55:38,684
>> I DON'T BELONG IN THIS WORLD,

1311
00:55:38,686 --> 00:55:38,984
SUGAR.

1312
00:55:40,187 --> 00:55:42,287
I BELONG OUT THERE.

1313
00:55:42,289 --> 00:55:45,391
ON THE TRACKS.

1314
00:55:45,393 --> 00:55:45,958
>> WHERE WILL YOU GO?

1315
00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:49,194
WHAT WILL YOU DO?

1316
00:55:49,196 --> 00:55:51,163
>> I'LL BEFRIEND A LARGE, SIMPLE

1317
00:55:51,165 --> 00:55:51,563
MAN.

1318
00:55:51,565 --> 00:55:54,032
AND AT THE END OF THE STORY,

1319
00:55:54,034 --> 00:55:54,733
I'LL SHOOT HIM IN THE BACK OF

1320
00:55:54,735 --> 00:55:55,100
THE HEAD.

1321
00:55:56,804 --> 00:55:57,536
BUT IT WILL BE THE RIGHT THING

1322
00:55:57,538 --> 00:56:00,572
TO DO.

1323
00:56:00,574 --> 00:56:02,541
BECAUSE HE HAS RABIES.

1324
00:56:02,543 --> 00:56:04,076
>> I THINK YOU GOT YOUR

1325
00:56:04,078 --> 00:56:06,412
REFERENCES MIXED UP THERE, MARK.

1326
00:56:06,414 --> 00:56:08,981
>> I'LL ALWAYS LOVE YOU.

1327
00:56:08,983 --> 00:56:12,317
BUT NOW I GOT TO GO, BECAUSE I'M

1328
00:56:12,319 --> 00:56:15,187
EMBARRASSED I GOT TOO EXCITED

1329
00:56:15,189 --> 00:56:16,722
WITH SUNDAY SUPPER AND NOBODY

1330
00:56:16,724 --> 00:56:17,489
ELSE WANTED TO DO SUNDAY SUPPER.

1331
00:56:17,491 --> 00:56:21,326
GOOD-BYE.

1332
00:56:21,328 --> 00:56:24,196
>> WOW.

1333
00:56:24,198 --> 00:56:24,930
DO YOU THINK WE'LL EVER SEE HIM

1334
00:56:24,932 --> 00:56:26,965
