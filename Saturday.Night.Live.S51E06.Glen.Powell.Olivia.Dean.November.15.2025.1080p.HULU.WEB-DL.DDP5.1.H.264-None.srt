1
00:00:01,448 --> 00:00:04,878
>>> YOU'RE WATCHING C-SPAN.
THANK YOU.

2
00:00:04,878 --> 00:00:07,721
WE TAKE YOU NOW TO THE WHITE
HOUSE DAILY BRIEFING

3
00:00:07,721 --> 00:00:12,083
WHERE PRESS
SECRETARY KAROLINE LEAVITT IS
ABOUT TO HAVE A DAY.

4
00:00:12,084 --> 00:00:15,081
GOOD

5
00:00:15,081 --> 00:00:16,905
HELLO

6
00:00:16,905 --> 00:00:21,947
I AM JUST SO EXCITED TO BE
HERE AND ANSWER YOUR FRIENDLY
QUESTIONS.

7
00:00:21,947 --> 00:00:24,928
AS YOU ALL KNOW, THERE WAS NO
NEWS THIS WEEK.

8
00:00:24,928 --> 00:00:27,197
NOTHING HAPPENING WITH THE
PRESIDENT.

9
00:00:27,197 --> 00:00:30,104
NO WEIRD INFORMATION WAS
REVEALED.

10
00:00:30,104 --> 00:00:34,190
NO ONE HAD ANY ACCUSATIONS THAT
RHYME WITH "EDIFILE."

11
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:36,500
SO I'LL OPEN THE FLOOR TO
QUESTIONS

12
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:40,602
STARTING WITH CAITLIN
COLLINS FROM CNN WHO I OPENLY
HATE, GO AHEAD.

13
00:00:40,602 --> 00:00:45,579
>> WE DEFINITELY NEED TO START
WITH THE 20,000 EPSTEIN EMAILS.

14
00:00:45,579 --> 00:00:49,646
WHY DOES PRESIDENT TRUMP'S NAME
APPEAR IN SEASON OF THEM.

15
00:00:49,646 --> 00:00:52,576
>> YOU KNOW YOU SUCK, RIGHT?

16
00:00:52,576 --> 00:00:57,299
>> TRUMP HAS ASKED THE DOJ TO
INVESTIGATE DEMOCRATS' TIES TO EPSTEIN,

17
00:00:57,299 --> 00:00:59,356
BUT IS ANYONE
INVESTIGATING TRUMP?

18
00:00:59,356 --> 00:01:02,464
>> LOOK, THE ONLY THING THESE
EMAILS PROVE

19
00:01:02,464 --> 00:01:04,964
IS THAT PRESIDENT
TRUMP DID NOTHING WRONG.

20
00:01:04,964 --> 00:01:07,918
IF ANYTHING, HIS CRIME WAS
LOVING TOO MUCH.

21
00:01:08,003 --> 00:01:10,476
AND POSSIBLY TOO YOUNG.

22
00:01:10,476 --> 00:01:15,121
NOW, LET'S GET A RELEVANT
QUESTION.
FOX NEWS?

23
00:01:15,121 --> 00:01:18,182
>> UNNAMED BLACK GUY, FOX NEWS.

24
00:01:18,182 --> 00:01:21,215
IS PRESIDENT TRUMP TOO HEALTHY?

25
00:01:21,215 --> 00:01:23,650
>> THANK YOU.

26
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:28,351
AND, YES.
HE GOT HIS 30th PHYSICAL LAST WEEK,

27
00:01:28,351 --> 00:01:29,889
AND IT WENT GREAT.

28
00:01:29,889 --> 00:01:32,794
HE TOOK A COGNITIVE TEST AND DID
SO WELL,

29
00:01:32,794 --> 00:01:35,209
THEY SAID "WE'D LIKE TO
SEE YOU AGAIN AS SOON AS
POSSIBLE."

30
00:01:35,209 --> 00:01:37,535
YES, MSNBC, GO AHEAD.

31
00:01:37,535 --> 00:01:41,499
>> ARE YOU NOT WORRIED ABOUT THE
OPTICS OF TRUMP GIVING EPSTEIN'S
PARTNER IN CRIME,

32
00:01:41,499 --> 00:01:43,719
GHISLAINE
MAXWELL, A SWEETHEART DEAL?

33
00:01:43,719 --> 00:01:46,353
>> HEY, GHISLAINE MAXWELL SAID

34
00:01:46,353 --> 00:01:49,759
IN A SWORN DEPOSITION SHE GAVE
TO TRUMP'S FRIEND

35
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:52,693
THAT TRUMP
ALWAYS ACTED LIKE A GENTLEMAN.

36
00:01:52,693 --> 00:01:56,950
AND A LITTLE THING ABOUT ME?
I BELIEVE WOMEN.

37
00:01:57,873 --> 00:02:03,157
NOW, SERIOUSLY, CAN WE PLEASE
MOVE OFF THE TOPIC OF EPSTEIN?

38
00:02:03,157 --> 00:02:06,482
>> SURE.
IS IT TRUE THE ADMINISTRATION

39
00:02:06,482 --> 00:02:11,201
SECRETLY SENT $840 MILLION TO
ARGENTINA TO PAY OFF THEIR
DEBTS?

40
00:02:11,201 --> 00:02:14,932
>> WE SHALL RETURN TO EPSTEIN!

41
00:02:15,916 --> 00:02:19,263
>> I'M SORRY, BUT EVEN TRUMP'S
BIGGEST SUPPORTERS THINK

42
00:02:19,263 --> 00:02:21,315
THAT HE
SHOULD RELEASE THE EPSTEIN
FILES.

43
00:02:21,315 --> 00:02:23,230
WHAT DOES TRUMP HAVE TO HIDE?

44
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:24,815
>> I COULD ANSWER THAT.

45
00:02:24,815 --> 00:02:27,597
I AM HIDING ALMOST NOTHING.

46
00:02:27,597 --> 00:02:31,664
JUST ENOUGH TO MAKE IT EXTREMELY
SUSPICIOUS.

47
00:02:31,664 --> 00:02:33,592
BUT LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION.

48
00:02:33,592 --> 00:02:36,958
IF THERE WAS SOMETHING
INCRIMINATING ABOUT ME IN THE FILES,

49
00:02:36,958 --> 00:02:39,768
THEN WHY WOULD I COVER
THEM UP?

50
00:02:40,716 --> 00:02:45,060
>> WAIT.
ISN'T THAT EXACTLY WHY YOU WOULD
COVER THEM UP?

51
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:46,868
>> OKAY.
LET ME GO AGAIN.

52
00:02:46,868 --> 00:02:51,150
IF I WAS INNOCENT, WOULDN'T I
JUST RELEASE ALL THE FILES?

53
00:02:51,707 --> 00:02:53,439
>> YEAH.

54
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:57,156
AGAIN, I THINK YOU'RE AGREEING
WITH WHAT EVERYONE IS SAYING.

55
00:02:57,156 --> 00:02:59,542
>> OKAY.
THIRD TIME'S A CHARM.

56
00:02:59,542 --> 00:03:02,497
JEFFREY EPSTEIN, I BARELY KNEW THE GUY,

57
00:03:02,497 --> 00:03:06,022
AS EVIDENCED BY THE
THOUSANDS OF PICTURES OF US
TOGETHER,

58
00:03:06,022 --> 00:03:09,144
DANCING AND GRINDING
OUR TEETH AT VARIOUS PARTIES.

59
00:03:09,144 --> 00:03:12,691
ALWAYS LEERING AND POINTING AT
SOMETHING JUST OFF CAMERA.

60
00:03:12,691 --> 00:03:15,643
PROBABLY A BOOK WE'RE EXCITED TO
READ.

61
00:03:15,643 --> 00:03:19,966
>> OKAY, WHAT ABOUT THE SPECIFIC
EMAIL WHERE EPSTEIN SAID

62
00:03:19,966 --> 00:03:23,572
THAT
TRUMP WAS THE DOG THAT HASN'T
BARKED?

63
00:03:23,572 --> 00:03:27,532
>> OKAY, OKAY, FIRST OF ALL --
ALL RIGHT -- I'M NOT A DOG.

64
00:03:27,574 --> 00:03:32,160
I'M NOT A DOG.
I'M MORE OF A CUB.
OR POSSIBLY AN OTTER.

65
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:34,776
DEFINITELY NOT A TWINK.

66
00:03:34,776 --> 00:03:38,003
I THINK THAT'S CLEAR, NOT A
TWINK, RIGHT?
MAYBE TWONK.

67
00:03:38,003 --> 00:03:40,070
YOU KNOW GAYS HAVE WORDS FOR
EVERYTHING, RIGHT?

68
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:42,605
GEEKY, WE LIKE TO SAY GEEKY.

69
00:03:42,605 --> 00:03:43,826
IT MEANS TALKING.

70
00:03:43,826 --> 00:03:48,363
SECOND, I THOUGHT MEGYN KELLY
MADE A TERRIFIC POINT THIS WEEK.

71
00:03:48,363 --> 00:03:50,395
SHE SAID EPSTEIN'S NOT A
PEDOPHILE.

72
00:03:50,395 --> 00:03:53,380
TERRIFIC THING JUST TO SAY OUT
OF NOWHERE, GREAT JOB, MEGYN.

73
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:58,140
PUT HER BACK ON TV, LEGALIZE
MEGYN.

74
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:01,271
>> YOU SAID YOU KICKED EPSTEIN
OUT OF MAR-A-LAGO

75
00:04:01,271 --> 00:04:03,866
BUT HE SAID HE
WAS, QUOTE, NEVER A MEMBER?

76
00:04:03,866 --> 00:04:07,310
>> I SAID I KICKED JEFFREY ON IT
BECAUSE HE WAS A PEDOPHILE.

77
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:10,337
THEN I ALSO SAID I DIDN'T KNOW
HE DID ANYTHING WRONG.

78
00:04:10,337 --> 00:04:13,631
SO IT'S KIND OF HARD TO SQUARE
THAT CIRCLE UNTIL YOU REALIZE

79
00:04:13,631 --> 00:04:17,429
THAT TRUMP EXISTS ACROSS MANY
TIME LINES.

80
00:04:17,429 --> 00:04:20,586
IT'S THE TRUMP MULTIVERSE
THEORY.

81
00:04:20,586 --> 00:04:23,766
WE JUST HAPPEN TO BE LIVING IN
THE WORST POSSIBLE ONE.

82
00:04:23,766 --> 00:04:29,147
NOW, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME, I'M
GOING TO RELEASE ALL OF THE
EPSTEIN FILES.

83
00:04:29,147 --> 00:04:32,005
THIS IS GREAT.
EACH FILE WILL BE ON SALE

84
00:04:32,005 --> 00:04:34,930
FOR
THE LOW, LOW PRICE OF $800.

85
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:38,068
OH, SHE'S PRETTY, WHO'S THAT?
SHE'S BEAUTIFUL.

86
00:04:38,068 --> 00:04:40,145
I LIKE THAT.
SHE'S NICE.

87
00:04:40,145 --> 00:04:43,652
YOU KNOW, THIS IS A BEAUTIFUL,
ONE-OF-A-KIND, PRINTED-OUT
SCREEN SHOT

88
00:04:43,652 --> 00:04:45,968
IN VERY LOW RES

89
00:04:45,968 --> 00:04:49,322
OF ONE OF THE MANY FILES MENTIONING
PRESIDENT TRUMP.

90
00:04:49,322 --> 00:04:51,311
IT MAKES A GREAT STOCKING
STUFFER.

91
00:04:51,311 --> 00:04:55,961
I JUST ORDERED THE ONE THAT
SAYS, "DOES PUTIN HAVE THE PHOTO
OF TRUMP BLOWING BUBBA?"

92
00:04:55,961 --> 00:04:59,452
WE LOVE THAT, WHATEVER THE HELL
THAT MEANS.

93
00:04:59,453 --> 00:05:02,658
BUT I DID ONE VERY
GENEROUS THING TODAY.

94
00:05:02,658 --> 00:05:05,397
I PARDONED A TURKEY, OKAY?

95
00:05:05,397 --> 00:05:11,062
WHO BY COMPLETE COINCIDENCE IS A
CONVICTED SEX CRIMINAL.

96
00:05:11,062 --> 00:05:14,304
SO WE'RE GOING TO BE LOOKING
INTO THAT VERY SHORTLY, I CAN
ASSURE YOU THAT.

97
00:05:14,304 --> 00:05:18,026
SO MERRY THANKSGIVING.
WE'RE GOING TO BE SAYING MERRY
THANKSGIVING AGAIN.

98
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:22,250
AND LIVE FROM NEW YORK, IT'S
SATURDAY NIGHT!

99
00:07:25,696 --> 00:07:30,289
MUSICAL

100
00:07:30,289 --> 00:07:35,004
HOST

101
00:07:37,399 --> 00:07:42,300
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN -- GLEN
POWELL!

102
00:08:04,372 --> 00:08:07,674
THANK

103
00:08:07,674 --> 00:08:11,608
I AM SO HAPPY TO BE HERE.
IT HAS BEEN A WILD YEAR.

104
00:08:11,608 --> 00:08:15,368
MY TV SHOW PREMIERED.
I HAVE A MOVIE COMING OUT.

105
00:08:15,368 --> 00:08:17,636
THANK YOU, THANK YOU.

106
00:08:17,636 --> 00:08:20,243
AND I KNOW SOME OF YOU ARE TIRED
OF SEEING MY FACE.

107
00:08:20,243 --> 00:08:22,785
HELL, I'M TIRED OF SEEING MY
FACE, TOO.

108
00:08:22,785 --> 00:08:26,591
BUT YOU KNOW WHO IS NOT TIRED OF
SEEING MY FACE?

109
00:08:26,591 --> 00:08:28,608
YOUR MOM.

110
00:08:30,375 --> 00:08:33,897
BUT IT'S TRUE, MY FACE HAS BEEN
POPPING UP ALL OVER THE
INTERNET.

111
00:08:33,897 --> 00:08:36,655
SPECIFICALLY THIS PHOTO.

112
00:08:37,064 --> 00:08:41,235
LOOKS LIKE A GOLDEN RETRIEVER
ABOUT TO GET A TREAT.

113
00:08:41,235 --> 00:08:45,557
I'VE ALSO SEEN A LOT OF PEOPLE
SAY, GLEN POWELL CAME OUT OF
NOWHERE.

114
00:08:45,557 --> 00:08:50,464
AND THAT'S JUST NOT TRUE.
I STARTED ACTING WHEN I WAS 10
IN AUSTIN, TEXAS.

115
00:08:50,464 --> 00:08:52,171
THANK YOU.

116
00:08:52,171 --> 00:08:54,516
I DID STUDENT FILMS,

117
00:08:54,516 --> 00:08:57,398
LOCAL COMMERCIALS, INTERNET SAFETY
VIDEOS.

118
00:08:57,398 --> 00:09:01,290
EVEN, WHEN I WAS A TEEN, I
DIRECTED SOME OF MY OWN FILMS.

119
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:03,541
THEY WERE A LITTLE EXPERIMENTAL,
EMOTIONALLY NUANCED.

120
00:09:03,541 --> 00:09:05,584
I WAS WATCH ALONG LOT OF FRENCH
NEW WAVE AT THE TIME.

121
00:09:05,584 --> 00:09:08,265
I THINK YOU'LL SEE THE
INFLUENCE, CHECK IT OUT.

122
00:09:12,648 --> 00:09:16,621
¶ IS IT MORE THAN YOU BARGAINED
FOR YEAH ¶

123
00:09:16,621 --> 00:09:20,309
WATCH

124
00:09:20,766 --> 00:09:23,245
HONEST

125
00:09:25,968 --> 00:09:29,338
>> THAT WAS ACTUALLY MY AUDITION
FOR "TOP GUN."

126
00:09:29,338 --> 00:09:35,253
BUT MY FIRST BIG BREAK CAME IN
SPY KIDS 3D.

127
00:09:37,817 --> 00:09:42,080
I PLAYED A CHARACTER CALLED THE
LONG-FINGERED BOY.

128
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:47,288
THE LONG-FINGERED BOY -- A NAME
THAT GETS YOU ALL THE WRONG KIND
OF FRIENDS IN MIDDLE SCHOOL.

129
00:09:47,288 --> 00:09:51,288
NOW, BEING ON THAT SET WAS THE
PEAK OF MY LIFE.

130
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,609
UNTIL TONIGHT.

131
00:09:56,763 --> 00:09:59,627
HOSTING "SNL" IS A DREAM COME
TRUE.

132
00:09:59,627 --> 00:10:01,731
NOT JUST FOR ME BUT FOR MY WHOLE
FAMILY.

133
00:10:01,731 --> 00:10:05,046
AND, TRUE STORY, I WAS ACTUALLY
SUPPOSED TO HOST

134
00:10:05,046 --> 00:10:07,341
FOUR YEARS AGO
FOR "TOP GUN: MAVERICK."

135
00:10:07,341 --> 00:10:11,111
WHEN I GOT THE CALL, I WAS ON A
PORCH WITH MY FAMILY

136
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:14,543
AND WE JUST
ALL LOST OUR MINDS.
WE WERE JUMPING UP AND DOWN,
CELEBRATING.

137
00:10:14,543 --> 00:10:19,606
AND A U.P.S. DRIVER HAPPENED TO
BE DELIVERING A PACKAGE AT THAT
EXACT SAME MOMENT

138
00:10:19,606 --> 00:10:23,176
AND HE WAS
LIKE, "WHAT IS GOING ON?"
I'M HOSTING SNL"!"

139
00:10:23,176 --> 00:10:27,514
ARE YOU SERIOUS?
"YEP, CHRISTMAS EPISODE, TUNE"
IN.

140
00:10:27,514 --> 00:10:29,651
WE ALL TOOK A SELFIE WITH HIM.

141
00:10:29,651 --> 00:10:33,186
THIS IS THE SELFIE TO MARK THE
OCCASION.

142
00:10:34,764 --> 00:10:39,173
SO THAT'S ME AND MY WHOLE FAMILY
AND THE U.P.S. DRIVER.

143
00:10:39,173 --> 00:10:42,305
BUT THEN MY DREAM GOT TAKEN
AWAY.

144
00:10:42,305 --> 00:10:44,780
TOP GUN GOT DELAYED BECAUSE OF COVID, 

145
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:46,865
SO "SNL" HAD TO TAKE
THEIR OFFER BACK.

146
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,997
LORNE MICHAELS LITERALLY CALLED
ME AND SAID, 

147
00:10:48,997 --> 00:10:51,529
WITHOUT TOP GUN,
THESE ARE HIS WORDS,

148
00:10:51,529 --> 00:10:54,900
 "NO ONE
WILL KNOW WHO THE F YOU ARE."

149
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:57,073
SO I DIDN'T END UP HOSTING,

150
00:10:57,073 --> 00:11:06,147
WHICH MEANS FOR FOUR YEARS, THIS

151
00:11:06,149 --> 00:11:09,484
U.P.S. DRIVER WAS JUST GOING

152
00:11:09,486 --> 00:11:10,218
AROUND SAYING, GLEN POWELL IS A

153
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:10,518
LIAR.

154
00:11:12,789 --> 00:11:13,955
SO NOW I AM HERE, HOSTING.

155
00:11:13,957 --> 00:11:16,891
IT FEELS AMAZING.

156
00:11:16,893 --> 00:11:19,694
BUT WHAT FEELS EVEN BETTER IS

157
00:11:19,696 --> 00:11:21,062
PROVING TO THIS U.P.S. DRIVER

158
00:11:21,064 --> 00:11:21,596
THAT I AM NOT CRAZY.

159
00:11:22,966 --> 00:11:26,801
SO THIS IS REAL.

160
00:11:26,803 --> 00:11:30,205
MY SISTERS TRACKED HIM DOWN.

161
00:11:30,207 --> 00:11:31,573
'CAUSE THE WOMEN IN MY FAMILY

162
00:11:31,575 --> 00:11:32,540
ARE TERRIFYING.

163
00:11:32,943 --> 00:11:33,908
AND THEY FOUND THE CELL NUMBER

164
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:35,477
OF THIS U.P.S. GUY.

165
00:11:35,479 --> 00:11:36,678
HIS NAME IS MITCH.

166
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:38,246
SO TO PROVE TO MITCH THAT I AM

167
00:11:38,248 --> 00:11:40,482
NOT A LIAR, I FLEW HIM ALL THE

168
00:11:40,484 --> 00:11:41,583
WAY TO NEW YORK --

169
00:11:45,822 --> 00:11:46,121
COACH.

170
00:11:46,123 --> 00:11:48,289
I DON'T KNOW HOW "RUNNING MAN'S"

171
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:49,090
GOING TO DO YET.

172
00:11:49,493 --> 00:11:51,593
BUT I FLEW HIM HERE.

173
00:11:51,595 --> 00:11:53,061
AND HE THOUGHT IT WAS A SCAM,

174
00:11:53,063 --> 00:11:54,195
BUT HE STILL CAME.

175
00:11:54,598 --> 00:11:55,530
AND HE IS SITTING IN THE

176
00:11:55,532 --> 00:11:56,431
AUDIENCE TONIGHT.

177
00:11:56,433 --> 00:11:57,332
SO LET'S GIVE IT UP FOR MITCH,

178
00:11:57,334 --> 00:11:58,700
THE U.P.S. GUY.

179
00:12:04,875 --> 00:12:05,940
ALL RIGHT, SO MITCH?

180
00:12:05,942 --> 00:12:06,641
WHY DON'T YOU COME UP HERE.

181
00:12:06,643 --> 00:12:09,377
WE'LL RECREATE THE SELFIE.

182
00:12:09,379 --> 00:12:10,078
BRING THIS THING FULL CIRCLE.

183
00:12:16,319 --> 00:12:18,686
ALL RIGHT.

184
00:12:18,688 --> 00:12:20,889
LOOK, I HAD TO WAIT MY ENTIRE

185
00:12:20,891 --> 00:12:22,123
LIFE, PLUS FOUR YEARS, TO BE

186
00:12:22,125 --> 00:12:22,424
HERE.

187
00:12:22,426 --> 00:12:24,192
BUT IF I HAVE LEARNED ANYTHING,

188
00:12:24,194 --> 00:12:25,827
IT IS THAT THE BEST THINGS IN

189
00:12:25,829 --> 00:12:37,372
LIFE DON'T HAPPEN OVERNIGHT.

190
00:12:37,374 --> 00:12:38,673
AND NO ONE KNOWS THAT BETTER

191
00:12:38,675 --> 00:12:49,400
THAN THE U.P.S.

192
00:13:02,248 --> 00:13:06,384
DINNER TO ME.

193
00:13:06,386 --> 00:13:08,486
I'M SURE THE SUNNYSIDE SENIOR

194
00:13:08,488 --> 00:13:10,321
HOME ISN'T WHERE YOU WANTED TO

195
00:13:10,323 --> 00:13:10,989
SPEND YOUR THANKSGIVING.

196
00:13:10,991 --> 00:13:12,223
>> STOP THAT, GRANDMA.

197
00:13:12,225 --> 00:13:16,261
WE WANTED TO BE HERE.

198
00:13:16,263 --> 00:13:17,662
>> YEAH, PLUS YOU PROBABLY DON'T

199
00:13:17,664 --> 00:13:18,496
HAVE A LOT OF THANKSGIVINGS

200
00:13:18,498 --> 00:13:18,796
LEFT.

201
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:19,164
>> NATHAN!

202
00:13:21,735 --> 00:13:23,701
WELL, GRANDMA, BEFORE WE GO, WE

203
00:13:23,703 --> 00:13:25,370
HAVE A SPECIAL SURPRISE FOR YOU.

204
00:13:25,372 --> 00:13:26,971
WHEN WE WERE CLEANING OUT YOUR

205
00:13:26,973 --> 00:13:29,374
HOUSE, WE FOUND A BOX OF OLD

206
00:13:29,376 --> 00:13:30,441
PHOTOS FROM WHEN YOU WERE A

207
00:13:30,443 --> 00:13:30,942
LITTLE GIRL.

208
00:13:30,944 --> 00:13:32,844
>> NATHAN SCANNED THEM INTO THIS

209
00:13:32,846 --> 00:13:35,246
COOL APP CALLED "OLD-TIME PHOTOS

210
00:13:35,248 --> 00:13:36,181
BROUGHT TO LIFE."

211
00:13:36,183 --> 00:13:37,448
IT'S REALLY COOL.

212
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:39,017
HERE'S ONE OF YOUR PICTURES.

213
00:13:39,019 --> 00:13:39,317
>> OH!

214
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:41,286
THAT'S MY FATHER!

215
00:13:41,288 --> 00:13:43,655
HE'S SO YOUNG.

216
00:13:43,657 --> 00:13:44,255
>> YEAH.

217
00:13:44,257 --> 00:13:45,523
NOW WATCH WHAT THE APP DOES.

218
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:47,992
>> OH!

219
00:13:47,994 --> 00:13:49,093
WOW!

220
00:13:51,898 --> 00:13:54,799
OH, MY GOODNESS!

221
00:13:54,801 --> 00:13:57,001
HE WAS WAVING AND SMILING!

222
00:13:57,003 --> 00:13:58,670
HOW DID IT DO THAT?

223
00:13:58,672 --> 00:14:00,738
>> WELL, THE AI ANALYZES THE

224
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:02,240
PICTURE AND PROJECTS HOW THEY'D

225
00:14:02,242 --> 00:14:02,540
MOVE.

226
00:14:02,542 --> 00:14:03,274
>> OH, HERE'S ANOTHER ONE WITH

227
00:14:03,276 --> 00:14:07,178
YOUR MOM IN IT.

228
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:08,379
>> OH, LOOK AT HER!

229
00:14:08,381 --> 00:14:11,950
SO BEAUTIFUL.

230
00:14:11,952 --> 00:14:13,851
>> IS THAT A CIGARETTE?

231
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:14,986
GREAT GRANDMA SMOKED?

232
00:14:14,988 --> 00:14:17,222
>> OH, EVERYBODY DID BACK THEN.

233
00:14:17,224 --> 00:14:18,823
CAN YOU BRING THIS ONE TO LIFE

234
00:14:18,825 --> 00:14:19,090
TOO?

235
00:14:19,092 --> 00:14:21,593
>> OF COURSE, GRANDMA.

236
00:14:34,841 --> 00:14:36,074
>> WHY DID MY MOTHER SMOKE HER

237
00:14:36,076 --> 00:14:39,844
HOT DOG?

238
00:14:40,247 --> 00:14:42,947
>> SOMETIMES THE AI IS WEIRD,

239
00:14:42,949 --> 00:14:43,915
BUT ISN'T IT COOL?

240
00:14:43,917 --> 00:14:45,650
LOOK, EVEN THAT DOG'S TAIL IS

241
00:14:45,652 --> 00:14:46,017
WAGGING.

242
00:14:46,019 --> 00:14:46,884
>> OH, THAT WAS SADIE, OUR

243
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:48,319
FAMILY PUP.

244
00:14:55,595 --> 00:14:57,662
>> OH, MY GOD!

245
00:14:57,664 --> 00:14:59,597
OH NO!

246
00:14:59,599 --> 00:14:59,864
OH!

247
00:14:59,866 --> 00:15:03,001
OH GOD!

248
00:15:03,003 --> 00:15:04,669
WHOA, WHY DID THE COMPUTER DO

249
00:15:04,671 --> 00:15:05,803
THAT TO SADIE?

250
00:15:05,805 --> 00:15:07,138
>> WELL, THERE'S PROBABLY JUST

251
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:08,539
TOO MUCH GOING ON IN THE

252
00:15:08,541 --> 00:15:10,642
PICTURE, AND THE AI GOT

253
00:15:10,644 --> 00:15:11,009
CONFUSED.

254
00:15:11,011 --> 00:15:12,076
HERE, LOOK AT THIS ONE.

255
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:13,845
IT'S YOUR DAD AND -- OH, SOME

256
00:15:13,847 --> 00:15:15,246
GUY IN A BOWLING ALLEY.

257
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:16,714
>> DO YOU KNOW HIM, GRANDMA?

258
00:15:16,716 --> 00:15:19,684
>> OH, THAT WAS MY FATHER'S BEST

259
00:15:19,686 --> 00:15:22,587
FRIEND, CAL RYLAND.

260
00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:24,088
OH, HE WAS A HOOT.

261
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:26,124
THEY WOULD GET TOGETHER AND

262
00:15:26,126 --> 00:15:27,225
LAUGH AND LAUGH.

263
00:15:27,227 --> 00:15:29,560
OH, CAN YOU BRING THIS ONE TO

264
00:15:29,562 --> 00:15:30,361
LIFE TOO?

265
00:15:30,363 --> 00:15:31,896
>> OF COURSE, GRANDMA.

266
00:15:31,898 --> 00:15:33,464
BUT JUST SO YOU KNOW, WE ONLY

267
00:15:33,466 --> 00:15:35,199

268
00:15:35,201 --> 00:15:35,500
LEFT.

269
00:15:35,902 --> 00:15:37,035
BEFORE I HAVE TO BUY MORE

270
00:15:37,037 --> 00:15:37,669
CREDITS ON THE APP.

271
00:15:37,671 --> 00:15:38,036
>> NATHAN!

272
00:15:38,038 --> 00:15:40,138
>> WHAT?

273
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:42,006
>> HERE, GRANDMA, I'LL DO IT.

274
00:15:54,521 --> 00:16:01,025
>> OH!

275
00:16:08,401 --> 00:16:12,070
>> WHAT WAS THAT?

276
00:16:12,072 --> 00:16:15,239
>> UM -- I THINK WHAT HAPPENED,

277
00:16:15,241 --> 00:16:16,641
GRANDMA, WAS -- THEIR BOWLING

278
00:16:16,643 --> 00:16:19,110
BALLS FLOATED AWAY, AND THEN

279
00:16:19,112 --> 00:16:21,045
YOUR DAD PAID CAL RYLAND TO SHOW

280
00:16:21,047 --> 00:16:21,579
HIS KEN DOLL CROTCH.

281
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:26,117
>> BUT WHY?

282
00:16:26,119 --> 00:16:27,719
>> DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT,

283
00:16:27,721 --> 00:16:28,052
GRANDMA.

284
00:16:28,054 --> 00:16:29,554
LET'S JUST DO ONE MORE.

285
00:16:29,556 --> 00:16:31,155
>> HERE, WE FOUND A SPECIAL ONE

286
00:16:31,157 --> 00:16:31,656

>> AS FAR AS WE CAN TELL, IT'S

288
00:16:33,026 --> 00:16:34,926
THE FIRST PICTURE YOU EVER TOOK.

289
00:16:34,928 --> 00:16:37,495
YOU'RE JUST A LITTLE, LITTLE

290
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:37,795
BABY.

291
00:16:37,797 --> 00:16:42,100
>> OH, MY HEAVENS, LOOK AT THAT.

292
00:16:42,102 --> 00:16:43,167
YOU KNOW, MAYBE WE DON'T BRING

293
00:16:43,169 --> 00:16:43,668
THIS ONE TO LIFE.

294
00:16:45,739 --> 00:16:48,506
IT'S JUST SO NICE THE WAY IT IS.

295
00:16:48,508 --> 00:16:50,975
>> WELL -- IT COST ME 10 CREDITS

296
00:16:50,977 --> 00:16:51,776
JUST TO UPLOAD IT TO THE APP, SO

297
00:16:51,778 --> 00:16:52,310
WE'RE GOING TO.

298
00:16:57,517 --> 00:17:01,119
>> OH, MY GOD!

299
00:17:01,121 --> 00:17:05,723
OH, NO!

300
00:17:05,725 --> 00:17:06,224
OH, WHAT IS THAT?

301
00:17:06,226 --> 00:17:07,959
MAKE IT LEAVE!

302
00:17:07,961 --> 00:17:10,395
OH, NO!

303
00:17:10,397 --> 00:17:15,600
NO!

304
00:17:15,602 --> 00:17:16,267
ALL RIGHT, I THINK I'VE HAD

305
00:17:16,269 --> 00:17:18,569
ENOUGH OF THE PHOTOS.

306
00:17:18,571 --> 00:17:20,638
>> WE'RE SORRY, GRANDMA, WE JUST

307
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,306
WANTED TO DO SOMETHING SPECIAL

308
00:17:22,308 --> 00:17:22,874
FOR YOU.

309
00:17:22,876 --> 00:17:23,908

00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:26,911
YOU CAME TO VISIT ME.

311
00:17:26,913 --> 00:17:29,013
NOW I'LL LET YOU GO, BUT WILL I

312
00:17:29,015 --> 00:17:29,981
SEE YOU FOR CHRISTMAS?

313
00:17:29,983 --> 00:17:31,883
>> OF COURSE, GRANDMA.

314
00:17:31,885 --> 00:17:34,318
>> YEAH, IF YOU MAKE IT TILL

315
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:34,619
THEN.

316
00:17:34,621 --> 00:17:35,219
>> NATHAN!

317
00:17:35,221 --> 00:17:35,553

487
00:23:08,755 --> 00:23:09,787
>> OKAY.

488
00:23:09,789 --> 00:23:10,154
HURTFUL.

489
00:23:10,156 --> 00:23:11,822
>> I'M SORRY, HOW DO YOU TWO

490
00:23:11,824 --> 00:23:12,456
KNOW EACH OTHER?

491
00:23:12,458 --> 00:23:14,425
>> OH, WE ACTUALLY WENT TO CAMP

492
00:23:14,427 --> 00:23:15,993
TOGETHER, FOUR YEARS IN A ROW.

493
00:23:15,995 --> 00:23:16,761
>> SOME OF THE BEST TIMES OF MY

494
00:23:16,763 --> 00:23:17,061
LIFE.

495
00:23:17,063 --> 00:23:19,663
>> OKAY.

496
00:23:19,665 --> 00:23:21,365
MAYBE WE SHOULD JUST MOVE PAST

497
00:23:21,367 --> 00:23:22,500
THE GAME PORTION OF THE EVENING.

498
00:23:22,502 --> 00:23:23,801
>> THIS GUY.

499
00:23:23,803 --> 00:23:25,169
>> BECAUSE I KIND OF WANTED TO

500
00:23:25,171 --> 00:23:25,970
MAKE A SPEECH.

501
00:23:25,972 --> 00:23:26,504
I KNOW, THAT SUCKS.

502
00:23:26,506 --> 00:23:28,639
THAT SUCKS.

503
00:23:28,641 --> 00:23:30,775
BUT I DO WANT TO SAY A FEW WORDS

504
00:23:30,777 --> 00:23:32,610
BEFORE YOU OFFICIALLY TIE THE

505
00:23:32,612 --> 00:23:32,910
KNOT.

506
00:23:32,912 --> 00:23:36,080
>> LET ME TELL YOU THE BIGGEST

507
00:23:36,082 --> 00:23:37,782
PROBLEM, THE BIGGEST PROBLEM

508
00:23:37,784 --> 00:23:39,750
WITH TYING THE KNOT, OKAY?

509
00:23:39,752 --> 00:23:42,586
WHEN YOU GOT A BOW, YOU GOT TO

510
00:23:42,588 --> 00:23:44,588
TIE A KNOT AS TIGHT AS YOU CAN.

511
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:52,129
IF YOU MAKE A MISTAKE, OKAY?

512
00:23:52,131 --> 00:23:55,199
THAT BOW THAT COST YOU HALF YOUR

513
00:23:55,201 --> 00:23:57,301
SALARY, IT'S KISS IT GOOD-BYE.

514
00:23:57,303 --> 00:23:58,836
>> THAT IS EXACTLY WHY I DON'T

515
00:23:58,838 --> 00:23:59,703
HAVE A BOAT BECAUSE I DON'T WANT

516
00:23:59,705 --> 00:24:00,671
TO KISS IT GOOD-BYE.

517
00:24:00,673 --> 00:24:01,739
>> IT'S BETTER WHEN SEBASTIAN

518
00:24:01,741 --> 00:24:02,106
DOES IT.

519
00:24:02,108 --> 00:24:03,641
>> OKAY, I'M SORRY.

520
00:24:03,643 --> 00:24:05,075
SEBASTIAN, IT'S AWESOME MEETING

521
00:24:05,077 --> 00:24:07,144
YOU, MAN, BUT THIS WEEKEND IS

522
00:24:07,146 --> 00:24:07,812
ABOUT DAVE.

523
00:24:07,814 --> 00:24:09,280
LIKE, HE'S THE ONE GETTING

524
00:24:09,282 --> 00:24:09,713
MARRIED.

525
00:24:09,715 --> 00:24:10,114
>> OH.

526
00:24:10,116 --> 00:24:13,918
YOU WANT SOME MARRIAGE ADVICE?

527
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:16,654
THE BIGGEST OBSTACLE IS GOING TO

528
00:24:16,656 --> 00:24:18,222
BE THE MOTHER-IN-LAW, OKAY?

529
00:24:18,224 --> 00:24:20,090
AND IT'S NOT THE TYPE OF

530
00:24:20,092 --> 00:24:20,758
OBSTACLE YOU CAN STEP OVER.

531
00:24:23,362 --> 00:24:25,696
NO, YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO JUMP

532
00:24:25,698 --> 00:24:27,698
OVER THE MOTHER-IN-LAW.

533
00:24:28,501 --> 00:24:30,267
>> SEBASTIAN, I SWEAR, YOUR BODY

534
00:24:30,269 --> 00:24:31,836
IS A WONDER LAND.

535
00:24:31,838 --> 00:24:32,303
>> THANK YOU.

536
00:24:32,305 --> 00:24:33,337
>> OKAY, GUYS.

537
00:24:33,339 --> 00:24:34,538
SEBASTIAN HAS TOTALLY CHANGED

538
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:37,074
THE DYNAMIC OF THIS SLEEPOVER.

539
00:24:37,076 --> 00:24:38,709
>> HEY, DON'T DO THAT.

540
00:24:38,711 --> 00:24:39,910
IT'S NOT A SLEEPOVER.

541
00:24:39,912 --> 00:24:41,779
>> I THINK WHAT AUSTIN IS TRYING

542
00:24:41,781 --> 00:24:43,347
TO SAY IS IT'S STARTING TO FEEL

543
00:24:43,349 --> 00:24:45,449
LIKE YOU DON'T REALLY CARE ABOUT

544
00:24:45,451 --> 00:24:47,551
US, YOU ONLY REALLY CARE ABOUT

545
00:24:47,553 --> 00:24:49,653
SEBASTIAN MANISCALO.

546
00:24:49,655 --> 00:24:51,455
>> IF YOU GUYS CAN'T HANG AROUND

547
00:24:51,457 --> 00:24:52,957
WITH ME WHEN I'M AROUND

548
00:24:52,959 --> 00:24:54,024
SEBASTIAN, THEN MAYBE YOU

549
00:24:54,026 --> 00:24:55,459
SHOULDN'T HANG AROUND WITH ME AT

550
00:24:55,461 --> 00:24:55,759
ALL.

551
00:24:55,761 --> 00:24:57,728
>> AND THAT'S FACT.

552
00:24:57,730 --> 00:24:58,562
LISTEN.

553
00:24:58,564 --> 00:25:01,232
MY SINCEREST APOLOGIES TO YOU

554
00:25:01,234 --> 00:25:01,532
GUYS.

555
00:25:01,534 --> 00:25:03,434
I JUST HAVEN'T SEEN DAVE IN A

556
00:25:03,436 --> 00:25:04,101
WHILE.

557
00:25:04,103 --> 00:25:05,769
AND THIS GUY, THEY TAUGHT ME

558
00:25:05,771 --> 00:25:07,137
EVERYTHING I KNOW.

559
00:25:07,139 --> 00:25:07,738
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

560
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:09,673
YOU KNOW, EVER SINCE WE WERE TWO

561
00:25:09,675 --> 00:25:14,211
KIDS AT SUMMER CAMP BACK WHEN WE

562
00:25:14,213 --> 00:25:16,580
WOULD BE PLAYING.

563
00:25:16,582 --> 00:25:17,181
SHOOTING BASKETBALL.

564
00:25:17,183 --> 00:25:18,082
WE USED TO LOVE TO SWIM.

565
00:25:18,084 --> 00:25:21,652
WE WERE SWIMMING.

566
00:25:21,654 --> 00:25:23,087
>> PEOPLE DON'T KNOW THIS, BUT

567
00:25:23,089 --> 00:25:24,655
ME AND THIS GUY, WE WERE LIKE

568
00:25:24,657 --> 00:25:26,056
TWO PEAS IN A POD, YOU

569
00:25:26,058 --> 00:25:26,457
UNDERSTAND?

570
00:25:26,459 --> 00:25:28,259
>> I KNOW I SOUND DIFFERENT NOW,

571
00:25:28,261 --> 00:25:29,426
BUT THAT IS STILL WHO I AM ON

572
00:25:29,428 --> 00:25:31,528
THE INSIDE.

573
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:33,030
EVERY DAY I HAVE TO QUIET DOWN

574
00:25:33,032 --> 00:25:34,965
MY INNER SEBASTIAN.

575
00:25:34,967 --> 00:25:36,200
I GOT TO PUSH IT DOWN.

576
00:25:36,202 --> 00:25:38,702
I GOT TO SAY, NOT NOW.

577
00:25:38,704 --> 00:25:39,703
>> WOW.

578
00:25:39,705 --> 00:25:40,004
SORRY.

579
00:25:40,006 --> 00:25:42,072
WE DIDN'T KNOW THAT.

580
00:25:42,074 --> 00:25:43,073
>> IT'S OKAY.

581
00:25:43,075 --> 00:25:45,576
>> NO WAY FOR YOU TO KNOW THAT.

582
00:25:46,712 --> 00:25:49,113
>> HOW COULD THAT BE?

583
00:25:49,115 --> 00:25:51,382
>> OH, I DID ORDER A STRIPPER.

584
00:25:51,384 --> 00:25:52,850
I SHOULD WARN Y'ALL, SHE'S

585
00:25:52,852 --> 00:25:53,350
JENNIFER COOLIDGE.

586
00:25:53,352 --> 00:25:53,751
>> OH, WOW!

587
00:25:54,887 --> 00:25:58,822
HI, BOYS!

588
00:25:58,824 --> 00:26:00,658
I CAN'T WAIT TO DANCE FOR YOU.

589
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:02,192
AND DON'T WORRY.

590
00:26:02,194 --> 00:26:03,560
I STILL GOT A FAT ASS.

591
00:26:17,243 --> 00:26:28,719
>> Announcer: ON DECEMBER 6th,

592
00:26:41,232 --> 00:26:45,769
HONORED TO BE HERE IN OSLO,

00:26:48,808 --> 00:26:49,873
A MARRIAGE."

595
00:26:49,875 --> 00:26:52,276
I AM A HUGE FAN OF NORWEGIAN

596
00:26:52,278 --> 00:26:52,576
FILM.

597
00:26:52,578 --> 00:26:54,545
YOU GUYS TAKE SUCH AN

598
00:26:54,547 --> 00:26:56,347
UNFLINCHING LOOK AT THE WAYS WE

599
00:26:56,349 --> 00:26:57,715
DEVASTATE EACH OTHER.

600
00:26:57,717 --> 00:27:01,552
SO, LET'S GO FOR A TAKE.

601

12 TAKE 1.

603
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:12,229
>> AND ACTION!

604
00:27:12,231 --> 00:27:16,166
>> YOU THINK YOU LOST ME?

605
00:27:16,168 --> 00:27:17,401
>> PLEASE DON'T ASK ME THAT.

606
00:27:17,403 --> 00:27:18,736
>> WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?

607
00:27:18,738 --> 00:27:21,538
WORK AT THE BOOKSTORE TILL

608
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:22,806
YOU'RE 50?

609
00:27:22,808 --> 00:27:24,475
YOU SHOULD BE WRITING BOOKS, NOT

610
00:27:24,477 --> 00:27:25,042
SELLING THEM.

611
00:27:25,044 --> 00:27:26,443
>> HOW CAN YOU SAY THIS?

612
00:27:26,445 --> 00:27:28,412
EVERYTHING I DO IS FOR OUR SON.

613
00:27:28,414 --> 00:27:30,347
EVERYTHING CHANGED AFTER THE

614
00:27:30,349 --> 00:27:31,582
ACCIDENT.

615
00:27:31,584 --> 00:27:34,718
>> DON'T YOU USE HIM AS AN

616
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:35,052
EXCUSE.

617
00:27:35,054 --> 00:27:37,121
YOU'RE JUST AFRAID TO EVER WANT

618
00:27:37,123 --> 00:27:37,488
ANYTHING.

619
00:27:37,490 --> 00:27:40,090
>> AND YOU THINK THAT MAKES ME A

620
00:27:40,092 --> 00:27:40,424
COWARD.

621
00:27:40,426 --> 00:27:42,459
>> YOU'RE TOO LAZY TO BE A

622
00:27:42,461 --> 00:27:42,793
COWARD.

623
00:27:42,795 --> 00:27:47,464
A COWARD HAS THE ENERGY TO HIDE.

624
00:27:47,466 --> 00:27:48,065
YOU JUST SIT THERE.

625
00:27:48,067 --> 00:27:50,968

43 DAYS, AND YOU KNOW FIRST DAY

BACK IN THE OFFICE, YOU GOT TO

1094

CHECK ALL THOSE PILED-UP EMAILS.

1095
00:43:46,324 --> 00:43:48,257
HOUSE DEMOCRATS RELEASED AN

1096
00:43:48,259 --> 00:43:49,726
EMAIL WRITTEN BY JEFFREY EPSTEIN

1097
00:43:49,728 --> 00:43:50,960
IN WHICH HE CLAIMS THAT DONALD

1098
00:43:50,962 --> 00:43:53,896
TRUMP, QUOTE, KNEW ABOUT THE

1099
00:43:53,898 --> 00:43:54,530
GIRLS.

1100
00:43:54,532 --> 00:43:55,798
IT'S BOMBSHELL NEWS THAT LEGAL

1101
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:56,399
EXPERTS ARE CALLING DUH.

1102
00:44:00,005 --> 00:44:01,671
THIS WEEK'S EPSTEIN DOCUMENTS

1103
00:44:01,673 --> 00:44:03,473
ARE OBVIOUSLY VERY DARK AND

1104
00:44:03,475 --> 00:44:04,607
DISTURBING, BUT I ALSO THINK

1105
00:44:04,609 --> 00:44:06,709
IT'S KIND OF ADORABLE THAT

1106
00:44:06,711 --> 00:44:10,413
EPSTEIN'S EMAIL ADDRESS WAS

1107
00:44:10,415 --> 00:44:10,913
JEEVACATION@GMAIL.

1108
00:44:10,915 --> 00:44:16,185
IT'S LIKE IF JEFFREY DAHMER AS

1109
00:44:18,223 --> 00:44:18,788
DINNERTIMEJEFF@YAHOO!.

1110
00:44:19,190 --> 00:44:19,889
>> IN ONE OF THE EMAILS,

1111
00:44:19,891 --> 00:44:20,590
EPSTEIN'S BROTHER ASKED IF

1112
00:44:20,592 --> 00:44:22,091
VLADIMIR PUTIN HAS A PICTURE OF

1113
00:44:22,093 --> 00:44:23,393
DONALD TRUMP GIVING ORAL SEX TO

1114
00:44:23,395 --> 00:44:25,762
SOMEONE NAMED BUBBA.

1115
00:44:25,764 --> 00:44:27,397
WHICH WAS AN OLD NICKNAME FOR

1116
00:44:27,399 --> 00:44:28,264
BILL CLINTON.

1117
00:44:28,266 --> 00:44:29,298
SO I GUESS THAT'S ONE JOB TRUMP

1118
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:29,699
HAS CREATED.

1119
00:44:32,804 --> 00:44:34,203
I DON'T KNOW IF THAT ORAL SEX

1120
00:44:34,205 --> 00:44:35,671
STORY IS TRUE, BUT I DO KNOW

1121
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:37,774
THAT IMAGE IS BURNED IN MY

1122
00:44:37,776 --> 00:44:38,174
BRAIN.

1123
00:44:38,576 --> 00:44:39,208
LIKE THAT SCENE FROM "THE

1124
00:44:39,210 --> 00:44:41,811
SHINING."

1125
00:44:42,213 --> 00:44:44,380
ACCORDING TO ONE RELEASED EMAIL,

1126
00:44:44,382 --> 00:44:45,815
JEFFREY EPSTEIN CLAIMED THAT HE

1127
00:44:45,817 --> 00:44:48,184
WAS, QUOTE, THE ONE ABLE TO TAKE

1128
00:44:48,186 --> 00:44:48,951
TRUMP DOWN.

1129
00:44:48,953 --> 00:44:50,453
WHICH IS PRETTY BIG TALK FOR A

1130
00:44:50,455 --> 00:44:53,723
GUY WHO LOST TO A BEDSHEET.

1131
00:45:00,298 --> 00:45:02,098
>> I JUST HAVE TO SAY IN GENERAL

1132
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:03,166
I DON'T BELIEVE IN CONSPIRACIES.

1133
00:45:03,168 --> 00:45:03,866
BECAUSE AS A MEMBER OF THE

1134
00:45:03,868 --> 00:45:04,300
ILLUMINATI --

1135
00:45:07,138 --> 00:45:08,037
I KNOW THAT WE, THE LIZARD

1136
00:45:08,039 --> 00:45:10,706
PEOPLE, CONTROL EVERYTHING.

1137
00:45:10,708 --> 00:45:12,341
AND IT'S REALLY HARD TO BELIEVE

1138
00:45:12,343 --> 00:45:14,510
THAT TRUMP WAS SO OBLIVIOUS THAT

1139
00:45:14,512 --> 00:45:15,978
HE DIDN'T NOTICE HIS GOOD FRIEND

1140
00:45:15,980 --> 00:45:16,946
WAS RUNNING AN INTERNATIONAL

1141
00:45:16,948 --> 00:45:19,749
PEDOPHILE RING.

1142
00:45:19,751 --> 00:45:20,983
THOUGH I GUESS TRUMP IS THE ONE

1143
00:45:20,985 --> 00:45:25,254
GUY ON EARTH WHO THINKS "YMCA"

1144
00:45:25,256 --> 00:45:26,489
IS A STRAIGHT ANTHEM.

1145
00:45:26,891 --> 00:45:28,491
ON A BASIC LEVEL, IT'S JUST

1146
00:45:28,493 --> 00:45:30,660
SHOCKING HOW MANY ALLEGED

1147
00:45:30,662 --> 00:45:31,961
PEDOPHILES TRUMP WAS FRIENDS

1148
00:45:31,963 --> 00:45:32,829
WITH.

1149
00:45:32,831 --> 00:45:33,162
EPSTEIN.

1150
00:45:33,164 --> 00:45:33,863
PRINCE ANDREW.

1151
00:45:33,865 --> 00:45:34,697
AND DIDDY.

1152
00:45:34,699 --> 00:45:36,866
I MEAN, THAT'S A LOT, YOU KNOW?

1153
00:45:36,868 --> 00:45:38,734
I MEAN, THINK ABOUT YOUR OWN

1154
00:45:38,736 --> 00:45:40,169
FRIEND GROUP.

1155
00:45:40,171 --> 00:45:40,970
YOU KNOW?

1156
00:45:40,972 --> 00:45:42,038
HOW MANY PEDOPHILES DO YOU KNOW?

1157
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:44,707
ONE, MAYBE TWO?

1158
00:45:45,110 --> 00:45:47,410
BUT TRUMP'S LIKE THE FORREST

1159
00:45:47,412 --> 00:45:48,344
GUMP OF MEETING FAMOUS

1160
00:45:48,346 --> 00:45:48,744
PEDOPHILES.

1161
00:45:51,449 --> 00:45:53,316
>>> THE BILL ENDING THE

1162
00:45:53,318 --> 00:45:54,851
GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN WILL FUND

1163
00:45:54,853 --> 00:45:55,651

00:53:38,599 --> 00:53:39,965
>> YEAH, YOU IDIOT.

1378

DID YOU THINK I WAS A TRAFFICKER

1379
00:53:41,435 --> 00:53:44,136

I TRIED TO BE BRAVE.

1386
00:53:56,484 --> 00:53:57,683
AND IN THE END, THAT'S WHAT YOU
