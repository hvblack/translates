1
00:00:01,448 --> 00:00:04,878
>>> YOU'RE WATCHING C-SPAN.
THANK YOU.

2
00:00:04,878 --> 00:00:07,721
WE TAKE YOU NOW TO THE WHITE
HOUSE DAILY BRIEFING

3
00:00:07,721 --> 00:00:12,083
WHERE PRESS
SECRETARY KAROLINE LEAVITT IS
ABOUT TO HAVE A DAY.

4
00:00:12,084 --> 00:00:15,081
GOOD

5
00:00:15,081 --> 00:00:16,905
HELLO

6
00:00:16,905 --> 00:00:21,947
I AM JUST SO EXCITED TO BE
HERE AND ANSWER YOUR FRIENDLY
QUESTIONS.

7
00:00:21,947 --> 00:00:24,928
AS YOU ALL KNOW, THERE WAS NO
NEWS THIS WEEK.

8
00:00:24,928 --> 00:00:27,197
NOTHING HAPPENING WITH THE
PRESIDENT.

9
00:00:27,197 --> 00:00:30,104
NO WEIRD INFORMATION WAS
REVEALED.

10
00:00:30,104 --> 00:00:34,190
NO ONE HAD ANY ACCUSATIONS THAT
RHYME WITH "EDIFILE."

11
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:36,500
SO I'LL OPEN THE FLOOR TO
QUESTIONS

12
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:40,602
STARTING WITH CAITLIN
COLLINS FROM CNN WHO I OPENLY
HATE, GO AHEAD.

13
00:00:40,602 --> 00:00:45,579
>> WE DEFINITELY NEED TO START
WITH THE 20,000 EPSTEIN EMAILS.

14
00:00:45,579 --> 00:00:49,646
WHY DOES PRESIDENT TRUMP'S NAME
APPEAR IN SEASON OF THEM.

15
00:00:49,646 --> 00:00:52,576
>> YOU KNOW YOU SUCK, RIGHT?

16
00:00:52,576 --> 00:00:57,299
>> TRUMP HAS ASKED THE DOJ TO
INVESTIGATE DEMOCRATS' TIES TO EPSTEIN,

17
00:00:57,299 --> 00:00:59,356
BUT IS ANYONE
INVESTIGATING TRUMP?

18
00:00:59,356 --> 00:01:02,464
>> LOOK, THE ONLY THING THESE
EMAILS PROVE

19
00:01:02,464 --> 00:01:04,964
IS THAT PRESIDENT
TRUMP DID NOTHING WRONG.

20
00:01:04,964 --> 00:01:07,918
IF ANYTHING, HIS CRIME WAS
LOVING TOO MUCH.

21
00:01:08,003 --> 00:01:10,476
AND POSSIBLY TOO YOUNG.

22
00:01:10,476 --> 00:01:15,121
NOW, LET'S GET A RELEVANT
QUESTION.
FOX NEWS?

23
00:01:15,121 --> 00:01:18,182
>> UNNAMED BLACK GUY, FOX NEWS.

24
00:01:18,182 --> 00:01:21,215
IS PRESIDENT TRUMP TOO HEALTHY?

25
00:01:21,215 --> 00:01:23,650
>> THANK YOU.

26
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:28,351
AND, YES.
HE GOT HIS 30th PHYSICAL LAST WEEK,

27
00:01:28,351 --> 00:01:29,889
AND IT WENT GREAT.

28
00:01:29,889 --> 00:01:32,794
HE TOOK A COGNITIVE TEST AND DID
SO WELL,

29
00:01:32,794 --> 00:01:35,209
THEY SAID "WE'D LIKE TO
SEE YOU AGAIN AS SOON AS
POSSIBLE."

30
00:01:35,209 --> 00:01:37,535
YES, MSNBC, GO AHEAD.

31
00:01:37,535 --> 00:01:41,499
>> ARE YOU NOT WORRIED ABOUT THE
OPTICS OF TRUMP GIVING EPSTEIN'S
PARTNER IN CRIME,

32
00:01:41,499 --> 00:01:43,719
GHISLAINE
MAXWELL, A SWEETHEART DEAL?

33
00:01:43,719 --> 00:01:46,353
>> HEY, GHISLAINE MAXWELL SAID

34
00:01:46,353 --> 00:01:49,759
IN A SWORN DEPOSITION SHE GAVE
TO TRUMP'S FRIEND

35
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:52,693
THAT TRUMP
ALWAYS ACTED LIKE A GENTLEMAN.

36
00:01:52,693 --> 00:01:56,950
AND A LITTLE THING ABOUT ME?
I BELIEVE WOMEN.

37
00:01:57,873 --> 00:02:03,157
NOW, SERIOUSLY, CAN WE PLEASE
MOVE OFF THE TOPIC OF EPSTEIN?

38
00:02:03,157 --> 00:02:06,482
>> SURE.
IS IT TRUE THE ADMINISTRATION

39
00:02:06,482 --> 00:02:11,201
SECRETLY SENT $840 MILLION TO
ARGENTINA TO PAY OFF THEIR
DEBTS?

40
00:02:11,201 --> 00:02:14,932
>> WE SHALL RETURN TO EPSTEIN!

41
00:02:15,916 --> 00:02:19,263
>> I'M SORRY, BUT EVEN TRUMP'S
BIGGEST SUPPORTERS THINK

42
00:02:19,263 --> 00:02:21,315
THAT HE
SHOULD RELEASE THE EPSTEIN
FILES.

43
00:02:21,315 --> 00:02:23,230
WHAT DOES TRUMP HAVE TO HIDE?

44
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:24,815
>> I COULD ANSWER THAT.

45
00:02:24,815 --> 00:02:27,597
I AM HIDING ALMOST NOTHING.

46
00:02:27,597 --> 00:02:31,664
JUST ENOUGH TO MAKE IT EXTREMELY
SUSPICIOUS.

47
00:02:31,664 --> 00:02:33,592
BUT LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION.

48
00:02:33,592 --> 00:02:36,958
IF THERE WAS SOMETHING
INCRIMINATING ABOUT ME IN THE FILES,

49
00:02:36,958 --> 00:02:39,768
THEN WHY WOULD I COVER
THEM UP?

50
00:02:40,716 --> 00:02:45,060
>> WAIT.
ISN'T THAT EXACTLY WHY YOU WOULD
COVER THEM UP?

51
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:46,868
>> OKAY.
LET ME GO AGAIN.

52
00:02:46,868 --> 00:02:51,150
IF I WAS INNOCENT, WOULDN'T I
JUST RELEASE ALL THE FILES?

53
00:02:51,707 --> 00:02:53,439
>> YEAH.

54
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:57,156
AGAIN, I THINK YOU'RE AGREEING
WITH WHAT EVERYONE IS SAYING.

55
00:02:57,156 --> 00:02:59,542
>> OKAY.
THIRD TIME'S A CHARM.

56
00:02:59,542 --> 00:03:02,497
JEFFREY EPSTEIN, I BARELY KNEW THE GUY,

57
00:03:02,497 --> 00:03:06,022
AS EVIDENCED BY THE
THOUSANDS OF PICTURES OF US
TOGETHER,

58
00:03:06,022 --> 00:03:09,144
DANCING AND GRINDING
OUR TEETH AT VARIOUS PARTIES.

59
00:03:09,144 --> 00:03:12,691
ALWAYS LEERING AND POINTING AT
SOMETHING JUST OFF CAMERA.

60
00:03:12,691 --> 00:03:15,643
PROBABLY A BOOK WE'RE EXCITED TO
READ.

61
00:03:15,643 --> 00:03:19,966
>> OKAY, WHAT ABOUT THE SPECIFIC
EMAIL WHERE EPSTEIN SAID

62
00:03:19,966 --> 00:03:23,572
THAT
TRUMP WAS THE DOG THAT HASN'T
BARKED?

63
00:03:23,572 --> 00:03:27,532
>> OKAY, OKAY, FIRST OF ALL --
ALL RIGHT -- I'M NOT A DOG.

64
00:03:27,574 --> 00:03:32,160
I'M NOT A DOG.
I'M MORE OF A CUB.
OR POSSIBLY AN OTTER.

65
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:34,776
DEFINITELY NOT A TWINK.

66
00:03:34,776 --> 00:03:38,003
I THINK THAT'S CLEAR, NOT A
TWINK, RIGHT?
MAYBE TWONK.

67
00:03:38,003 --> 00:03:40,070
YOU KNOW GAYS HAVE WORDS FOR
EVERYTHING, RIGHT?

68
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:42,605
GEEKY, WE LIKE TO SAY GEEKY.

69
00:03:42,605 --> 00:03:43,826
IT MEANS TALKING.

70
00:03:43,826 --> 00:03:48,363
SECOND, I THOUGHT MEGYN KELLY
MADE A TERRIFIC POINT THIS WEEK.

71
00:03:48,363 --> 00:03:50,395
SHE SAID EPSTEIN'S NOT A
PEDOPHILE.

72
00:03:50,395 --> 00:03:53,380
TERRIFIC THING JUST TO SAY OUT
OF NOWHERE, GREAT JOB, MEGYN.

73
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:58,140
PUT HER BACK ON TV, LEGALIZE
MEGYN.

74
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:01,271
>> YOU SAID YOU KICKED EPSTEIN
OUT OF MAR-A-LAGO

75
00:04:01,271 --> 00:04:03,866
BUT HE SAID HE
WAS, QUOTE, NEVER A MEMBER?

76
00:04:03,866 --> 00:04:07,310
>> I SAID I KICKED JEFFREY ON IT
BECAUSE HE WAS A PEDOPHILE.

77
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:10,337
THEN I ALSO SAID I DIDN'T KNOW
HE DID ANYTHING WRONG.

78
00:04:10,337 --> 00:04:13,631
SO IT'S KIND OF HARD TO SQUARE
THAT CIRCLE UNTIL YOU REALIZE

79
00:04:13,631 --> 00:04:17,429
THAT TRUMP EXISTS ACROSS MANY
TIME LINES.

80
00:04:17,429 --> 00:04:20,586
IT'S THE TRUMP MULTIVERSE
THEORY.

81
00:04:20,586 --> 00:04:23,766
WE JUST HAPPEN TO BE LIVING IN
THE WORST POSSIBLE ONE.

82
00:04:23,766 --> 00:04:29,147
NOW, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME, I'M
GOING TO RELEASE ALL OF THE
EPSTEIN FILES.

83
00:04:29,147 --> 00:04:32,005
THIS IS GREAT.
EACH FILE WILL BE ON SALE

84
00:04:32,005 --> 00:04:34,930
FOR
THE LOW, LOW PRICE OF $800.

85
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:38,068
OH, SHE'S PRETTY, WHO'S THAT?
SHE'S BEAUTIFUL.

86
00:04:38,068 --> 00:04:40,145
I LIKE THAT.
SHE'S NICE.

87
00:04:40,145 --> 00:04:43,652
YOU KNOW, THIS IS A BEAUTIFUL,
ONE-OF-A-KIND, PRINTED-OUT
SCREEN SHOT

88
00:04:43,652 --> 00:04:45,968
IN VERY LOW RES

89
00:04:45,968 --> 00:04:49,322
OF ONE OF THE MANY FILES MENTIONING
PRESIDENT TRUMP.

90
00:04:49,322 --> 00:04:51,311
IT MAKES A GREAT STOCKING
STUFFER.

91
00:04:51,311 --> 00:04:55,961
I JUST ORDERED THE ONE THAT
SAYS, "DOES PUTIN HAVE THE PHOTO
OF TRUMP BLOWING BUBBA?"

92
00:04:55,961 --> 00:04:59,452
WE LOVE THAT, WHATEVER THE HELL
THAT MEANS.

93
00:04:59,453 --> 00:05:02,658
BUT I DID ONE VERY
GENEROUS THING TODAY.

94
00:05:02,658 --> 00:05:05,397
I PARDONED A TURKEY, OKAY?

95
00:05:05,397 --> 00:05:11,062
WHO BY COMPLETE COINCIDENCE IS A
CONVICTED SEX CRIMINAL.

96
00:05:11,062 --> 00:05:14,304
SO WE'RE GOING TO BE LOOKING
INTO THAT VERY SHORTLY, I CAN
ASSURE YOU THAT.

97
00:05:14,304 --> 00:05:18,026
SO MERRY THANKSGIVING.
WE'RE GOING TO BE SAYING MERRY
THANKSGIVING AGAIN.

98
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:22,250
AND LIVE FROM NEW YORK, IT'S
SATURDAY NIGHT!

99
00:07:25,696 --> 00:07:30,289
MUSICAL

100
00:07:30,289 --> 00:07:35,004
HOST

101
00:07:37,399 --> 00:07:42,300
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN -- GLEN
POWELL!

102
00:08:04,372 --> 00:08:07,674
THANK

103
00:08:07,674 --> 00:08:11,608
I AM SO HAPPY TO BE HERE.
IT HAS BEEN A WILD YEAR.

104
00:08:11,608 --> 00:08:15,368
MY TV SHOW PREMIERED.
I HAVE A MOVIE COMING OUT.

105
00:08:15,368 --> 00:08:17,636
THANK YOU, THANK YOU.

106
00:08:17,636 --> 00:08:20,243
AND I KNOW SOME OF YOU ARE TIRED
OF SEEING MY FACE.

107
00:08:20,243 --> 00:08:22,785
HELL, I'M TIRED OF SEEING MY
FACE, TOO.

108
00:08:22,785 --> 00:08:26,591
BUT YOU KNOW WHO IS NOT TIRED OF
SEEING MY FACE?

109
00:08:26,591 --> 00:08:28,608
YOUR MOM.

110
00:08:30,375 --> 00:08:33,897
BUT IT'S TRUE, MY FACE HAS BEEN
POPPING UP ALL OVER THE
INTERNET.

111
00:08:33,897 --> 00:08:36,655
SPECIFICALLY THIS PHOTO.

112
00:08:37,064 --> 00:08:41,235
LOOKS LIKE A GOLDEN RETRIEVER
ABOUT TO GET A TREAT.

113
00:08:41,235 --> 00:08:45,557
I'VE ALSO SEEN A LOT OF PEOPLE
SAY, GLEN POWELL CAME OUT OF
NOWHERE.

114
00:08:45,557 --> 00:08:50,464
AND THAT'S JUST NOT TRUE.
I STARTED ACTING WHEN I WAS 10
IN AUSTIN, TEXAS.

115
00:08:50,464 --> 00:08:52,171
THANK YOU.

116
00:08:52,171 --> 00:08:54,516
I DID STUDENT FILMS,

117
00:08:54,516 --> 00:08:57,398
LOCAL COMMERCIALS, INTERNET SAFETY
VIDEOS.

118
00:08:57,398 --> 00:09:01,290
EVEN, WHEN I WAS A TEEN, I
DIRECTED SOME OF MY OWN FILMS.

119
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:03,541
THEY WERE A LITTLE EXPERIMENTAL,
EMOTIONALLY NUANCED.

120
00:09:03,541 --> 00:09:05,584
I WAS WATCH ALONG LOT OF FRENCH
NEW WAVE AT THE TIME.

121
00:09:05,584 --> 00:09:08,265
I THINK YOU'LL SEE THE
INFLUENCE, CHECK IT OUT.

122
00:09:12,648 --> 00:09:16,621
¶ IS IT MORE THAN YOU BARGAINED
FOR YEAH ¶

123
00:09:16,621 --> 00:09:20,309
WATCH

124
00:09:20,766 --> 00:09:23,245
HONEST

125
00:09:25,968 --> 00:09:29,338
>> THAT WAS ACTUALLY MY AUDITION
FOR "TOP GUN."

126
00:09:29,338 --> 00:09:35,253
BUT MY FIRST BIG BREAK CAME IN
SPY KIDS 3D.

127
00:09:37,817 --> 00:09:42,080
I PLAYED A CHARACTER CALLED THE
LONG-FINGERED BOY.

128
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:47,288
THE LONG-FINGERED BOY -- A NAME
THAT GETS YOU ALL THE WRONG KIND
OF FRIENDS IN MIDDLE SCHOOL.

129
00:09:47,288 --> 00:09:51,288
NOW, BEING ON THAT SET WAS THE
PEAK OF MY LIFE.

130
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,609
UNTIL TONIGHT.

131
00:09:56,763 --> 00:09:59,627
HOSTING "SNL" IS A DREAM COME
TRUE.

132
00:09:59,627 --> 00:10:01,731
NOT JUST FOR ME BUT FOR MY WHOLE
FAMILY.

133
00:10:01,731 --> 00:10:05,046
AND, TRUE STORY, I WAS ACTUALLY
SUPPOSED TO HOST

134
00:10:05,046 --> 00:10:07,341
FOUR YEARS AGO
FOR "TOP GUN: MAVERICK."

135
00:10:07,341 --> 00:10:11,111
WHEN I GOT THE CALL, I WAS ON A
PORCH WITH MY FAMILY

136
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:14,543
AND WE JUST
ALL LOST OUR MINDS.
WE WERE JUMPING UP AND DOWN,
CELEBRATING.

137
00:10:14,543 --> 00:10:19,606
AND A U.P.S. DRIVER HAPPENED TO
BE DELIVERING A PACKAGE AT THAT
EXACT SAME MOMENT

138
00:10:19,606 --> 00:10:23,176
AND HE WAS
LIKE, "WHAT IS GOING ON?"
I'M HOSTING SNL"!"

139
00:10:23,176 --> 00:10:27,514
ARE YOU SERIOUS?
"YEP, CHRISTMAS EPISODE, TUNE"
IN.

140
00:10:27,514 --> 00:10:29,651
WE ALL TOOK A SELFIE WITH HIM.

141
00:10:29,651 --> 00:10:33,186
THIS IS THE SELFIE TO MARK THE
OCCASION.

142
00:10:34,764 --> 00:10:39,173
SO THAT'S ME AND MY WHOLE FAMILY
AND THE U.P.S. DRIVER.

143
00:10:39,173 --> 00:10:42,305
BUT THEN MY DREAM GOT TAKEN
AWAY.

144
00:10:42,305 --> 00:10:44,780
TOP GUN GOT DELAYED BECAUSE OF COVID,

145
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:46,865
SO "SNL" HAD TO TAKE
THEIR OFFER BACK.

146
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,997
LORNE MICHAELS LITERALLY CALLED
ME AND SAID,

147
00:10:48,997 --> 00:10:51,529
WITHOUT TOP GUN,
THESE ARE HIS WORDS,

148
00:10:51,529 --> 00:10:54,900
"NO ONE
WILL KNOW WHO THE F YOU ARE."

149
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:59,326
SO I DIDN'T END UP HOSTING,
WHICH MEANS FOR FOUR YEARS,

150
00:10:59,326 --> 00:11:02,797
THIS
U.P.S. DRIVER WAS JUST GOING
AROUND

151
00:11:02,797 --> 00:11:05,759
SAYING, GLEN POWELL IS A
LIAR.

152
00:11:05,759 --> 00:11:10,756
SO NOW I AM HERE, HOSTING.
IT FEELS AMAZING.

153
00:11:10,756 --> 00:11:12,920
BUT WHAT FEELS EVEN BETTER

154
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:17,858
IS PROVING TO THIS U.P.S. DRIVER
THAT I AM NOT CRAZY.

155
00:11:17,858 --> 00:11:23,339
SO THIS IS REAL.
MY SISTERS TRACKED HIM DOWN.

156
00:11:23,339 --> 00:11:26,518
'CAUSE THE WOMEN IN MY FAMILY
ARE TERRIFYING.

157
00:11:26,518 --> 00:11:30,722
AND THEY FOUND THE CELL NUMBER
OF THIS U.P.S. GUY.
HIS NAME IS MITCH.

158
00:11:30,722 --> 00:11:33,640
SO TO PROVE TO MITCH THAT I AM
NOT A LIAR,

159
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:37,150
I FLEW HIM ALL THE
WAY TO NEW YORK --

160
00:11:38,999 --> 00:11:43,204
COACH.
I DON'T KNOW HOW "RUNNING MAN'S"
GOING TO DO YET.

161
00:11:43,626 --> 00:11:45,838
BUT I FLEW HIM HERE.

162
00:11:45,838 --> 00:11:48,572
AND HE THOUGHT IT WAS A SCAM,
BUT HE STILL CAME.

163
00:11:48,572 --> 00:11:50,862
AND HE IS SITTING IN THE
AUDIENCE TONIGHT.

164
00:11:50,862 --> 00:11:53,799
SO LET'S GIVE IT UP FOR MITCH,
THE U.P.S. GUY.

165
00:11:58,805 --> 00:12:01,501
ALL RIGHT, SO MITCH?
WHY DON'T YOU COME UP HERE.

166
00:12:01,501 --> 00:12:03,325
WE'LL RECREATE THE SELFIE.

167
00:12:03,325 --> 00:12:06,084
BRING THIS THING FULL CIRCLE.

168
00:12:12,735 --> 00:12:16,920
LOOK, I HAD TO WAIT MY ENTIRE
LIFE, PLUS FOUR YEARS, TO BE
HERE.

169
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,534
BUT IF I HAVE LEARNED ANYTHING,

170
00:12:18,534 --> 00:12:22,320
IT IS THAT THE BEST THINGS IN
LIFE DON'T HAPPEN OVERNIGHT.

171
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:26,463
AND NO ONE KNOWS THAT BETTER
THAN THE U.P.S.

172
00:12:26,464 --> 00:12:30,154
GREAT

173
00:12:30,154 --> 00:12:33,186
STICK

174
00:12:55,645 --> 00:13:00,986
NICE
DINNER TO ME.

175
00:13:00,986 --> 00:13:05,453
I'M SURE THE SUNNYSIDE SENIOR
HOME ISN'T WHERE YOU WANTED TO
SPEND YOUR THANKSGIVING.

176
00:13:05,453 --> 00:13:08,388
>> STOP THAT, GRANDMA.
WE WANTED TO BE HERE.

177
00:13:08,388 --> 00:13:12,224
>> YEAH, PLUS YOU PROBABLY DON'T
HAVE A LOT OF THANKSGIVINGS
LEFT.

178
00:13:12,224 --> 00:13:15,248
>> NATHAN!

179
00:13:15,248 --> 00:13:19,203
WELL, GRANDMA, BEFORE WE GO, WE
HAVE A SPECIAL SURPRISE FOR YOU.

180
00:13:19,203 --> 00:13:20,878
WHEN WE WERE CLEANING OUT YOUR HOUSE,

181
00:13:20,878 --> 00:13:23,634
WE FOUND A BOX OF OLD PHOTOS
FROM WHEN YOU WERE A
LITTLE GIRL.

182
00:13:23,634 --> 00:13:28,632
>> NATHAN SCANNED THEM INTO THIS
COOL APP CALLED "OLD-TIME PHOTOS
BROUGHT TO LIFE."

183
00:13:28,632 --> 00:13:32,677
IT'S REALLY COOL.
HERE'S ONE OF YOUR PICTURES.

184
00:13:33,348 --> 00:13:38,035
THAT'S MY FATHER!
HE'S SO YOUNG.

185
00:13:38,035 --> 00:13:40,975
>> YEAH.
NOW WATCH WHAT THE APP DOES.

186
00:13:43,658 --> 00:13:46,076
>> OH!
WOW!

187
00:13:46,076 --> 00:13:48,661
OH, MY GOODNESS!

188
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:53,016
HE WAS WAVING AND SMILING!
HOW DID IT DO THAT?

189
00:13:53,016 --> 00:13:56,916
>> WELL, THE AI ANALYZES THE
PICTURE AND PROJECTS HOW THEY'D
MOVE.

190
00:13:56,916 --> 00:14:00,230
>> OH, HERE'S ANOTHER ONE WITH
YOUR MOM IN IT.

191
00:14:01,730 --> 00:14:05,841
>> OH, LOOK AT HER!
SO BEAUTIFUL.

192
00:14:05,841 --> 00:14:09,010
>> IS THAT A CIGARETTE?
GREAT GRANDMA SMOKED?

193
00:14:09,010 --> 00:14:11,535
>> OH, EVERYBODY DID BACK THEN.

194
00:14:11,535 --> 00:14:16,263
CAN YOU BRING THIS ONE TO LIFE
TOO?
>> OF COURSE, GRANDMA.

195
00:14:28,822 --> 00:14:32,813
>> WHY DID MY MOTHER SMOKE HER
HOT DOG?

196
00:14:32,813 --> 00:14:35,896
>> SOMETIMES THE AI IS WEIRD,
BUT ISN'T IT COOL?

197
00:14:35,896 --> 00:14:39,168
LOOK, EVEN THAT DOG'S TAIL IS
WAGGING.

198
00:14:39,168 --> 00:14:43,564
>> OH, THAT WAS SADIE, OUR
FAMILY PUP.

199
00:14:53,923 --> 00:14:56,263
OH GOD!

200
00:14:56,263 --> 00:15:00,348
WHOA, WHY DID THE COMPUTER DO
THAT TO SADIE?

201
00:15:00,348 --> 00:15:03,275
>> WELL, THERE'S PROBABLY JUST
TOO MUCH GOING ON IN THE PICTURE,

202
00:15:03,275 --> 00:15:05,117
AND THE AI GOT
CONFUSED.

203
00:15:05,117 --> 00:15:07,640
HERE, LOOK AT THIS ONE.
IT'S YOUR DAD AND --

204
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,816
OH, SOME
GUY IN A BOWLING ALLEY.

205
00:15:09,816 --> 00:15:11,337
>> DO YOU KNOW HIM, GRANDMA?

206
00:15:11,337 --> 00:15:15,876
>> OH, THAT WAS MY FATHER'S BEST
FRIEND, CAL RYLAND.

207
00:15:15,876 --> 00:15:18,202
OH, HE WAS A HOOT.

208
00:15:18,202 --> 00:15:21,370
THEY WOULD GET TOGETHER AND
LAUGH AND LAUGH.

209
00:15:21,370 --> 00:15:25,977
OH, CAN YOU BRING THIS ONE TO
LIFE TOO?
>> OF COURSE, GRANDMA.

210
00:15:25,977 --> 00:15:29,368
BUT JUST SO YOU KNOW, WE ONLY
HAVE A COUPLE MORE FREE ONES
LEFT.

211
00:15:29,368 --> 00:15:32,319
BEFORE I HAVE TO BUY MORE
CREDITS ON THE APP.

212
00:15:32,319 --> 00:15:34,206
>> NATHAN!
>> WHAT?

213
00:15:34,206 --> 00:15:37,288
>> HERE, GRANDMA, I'LL DO IT.

214
00:16:02,652 --> 00:16:05,882
>> WHAT WAS THAT?

215
00:16:05,882 --> 00:16:09,549
>> UM -- I THINK WHAT HAPPENED,
GRANDMA, WAS --

216
00:16:09,549 --> 00:16:11,856
THEIR BOWLING
BALLS FLOATED AWAY,

217
00:16:11,856 --> 00:16:17,496
AND THEN
YOUR DAD PAID CAL RYLAND TO SHOW
HIS KEN DOLL CROTCH.

218
00:16:17,496 --> 00:16:19,438
>> BUT WHY?

219
00:16:19,438 --> 00:16:23,199
>> DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT,
GRANDMA.
LET'S JUST DO ONE MORE.

220
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:24,826
HERE, WE FOUND A SPECIAL ONE
FOR YOU.

221
00:16:24,826 --> 00:16:28,776
>> AS FAR AS WE CAN TELL, IT'S
THE FIRST PICTURE YOU EVER TOOK.

222
00:16:28,776 --> 00:16:31,230
YOU'RE JUST A LITTLE, LITTLE
BABY.

223
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:35,172
>> OH, MY HEAVENS, LOOK AT THAT.

224
00:16:35,172 --> 00:16:39,864
YOU KNOW, MAYBE WE DON'T BRING
THIS ONE TO LIFE.

225
00:16:39,864 --> 00:16:42,535
IT'S JUST SO NICE THE WAY IT IS.

226
00:16:42,535 --> 00:16:46,760
>> WELL -- IT COST ME 10 CREDITS
JUST TO UPLOAD IT TO THE APP,

227
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:49,010
SO
WE'RE GOING TO.

228
00:16:51,428 --> 00:16:54,620
>> OH, MY GOD!
HALF

229
00:16:57,983 --> 00:17:02,791
OH, WHAT IS THAT?
MAKE IT LEAVE!

230
00:17:02,791 --> 00:17:07,906
OH, NO!
NO!

231
00:17:09,177 --> 00:17:12,804
ALL RIGHT, I THINK I'VE HAD
ENOUGH OF THE PHOTOS.

232
00:17:12,804 --> 00:17:16,768
>> WE'RE SORRY, GRANDMA, WE JUST
WANTED TO DO SOMETHING SPECIAL
FOR YOU.

233
00:17:16,768 --> 00:17:20,668
>> OH, YOU DID.
YOU CAME TO VISIT ME.

234
00:17:20,668 --> 00:17:24,466
NOW I'LL LET YOU GO, BUT WILL I
SEE YOU FOR CHRISTMAS?

235
00:17:24,466 --> 00:17:25,681
>> OF COURSE, GRANDMA.

236
00:17:25,681 --> 00:17:27,332
>> YEAH, IF YOU MAKE IT TILL
THEN.

237
00:17:27,332 --> 00:17:29,986
>> NATHAN!
>> WHAT?

238
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:43,331
>>> YOU EVER MISS SOMEONE SO
MUCH, YOU LOSE SIGHT OF
YOURSELF?

239
00:17:43,331 --> 00:17:46,132
>> YOU THINK ABOUT THEM ALL THE
TIME.

240
00:17:46,132 --> 00:17:49,807
YOU WONDER IF LIFE WILL EVER
SEEM NORMAL AGAIN.

00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:36,535
¶ OH LEO MAN BIG RED

297
00:20:36,535 --> 00:20:39,138
I MISS MY DAUGHTER'S EX ¶

298
00:20:39,138 --> 00:20:42,724
¶ I WISH YOUR NEW BOYFRIEND WAS DEAD

299
00:20:42,724 --> 00:20:45,382
I MISS MY DAUGHTER'S EX ¶

300
00:20:45,382 --> 00:20:47,733
¶ YOU SHOULD BE HERE DRINKING BEER

301
00:20:47,733 --> 00:20:50,382
WITH YOUR FAVORITE DRINKING
LAD ¶

302
00:20:50,382 --> 00:20:56,038
¶ IT AIN'T UP TO ME BUT I'M
ALWAYS PROUD TO BE ¶

303
00:20:56,038 --> 00:20:59,442
¶ YOUR EX'S DAD ¶

304
00:21:03,913 --> 00:21:08,371
>>> THIS IS ABOUT TO BE THE BEST
BACHELOR WEEKEND OF OUR LIVES!

305
00:21:08,371 --> 00:21:10,638
>> HERE'S TO THE GROOM TO BE!

306
00:21:10,638 --> 00:21:14,423
>> NOW I'M THE ONLY ONE LEFT,
THE ONLY SINGLE ONE LEFT.

307
00:21:14,423 --> 00:21:18,028
IT'S JUST -- NO, IT WILL HAPPEN
FOR ME.

308
00:21:18,028 --> 00:21:21,667
>> GUYS, I JUST REALLY WANT TO
SAY THANK YOU FOR PUTTING THIS
ALL TOGETHER.

309
00:21:21,667 --> 00:21:24,116
IT IS GOING TO BE AN EPIC
WEEKEND.

310
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:26,433
>> I HOPE IT'S NOT A STRIPPER!

311
00:21:26,433 --> 00:21:29,772
>> I ACTUALLY FORGOT TO TELL YOU GUYS,

312
00:21:29,772 --> 00:21:32,159
I HAVE ONE MORE FRIEND
COMING, YOU NEVER MET HIM.

313
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:35,401
I SHOULD PROBABLY WARN YOU. HE'S --

314
00:21:35,401 --> 00:21:38,200
HE'S SEBASTIAN
MANISCALCO.

315
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:40,523
>> WAIT, LIKE THE WORLD-FAMOUS
COMEDIAN?

316
00:21:40,523 --> 00:21:45,538
>> YES, BUT HE IS NOTHING LIKE
WHAT YOU'VE SEEN ON TV, I
PROMISE.

317
00:21:51,272 --> 00:21:54,015
I'M DRIVING MY CAR.

318
00:21:54,015 --> 00:21:57,321
AND I'VE GOT THE STICK SHIFT
GOING.

319
00:21:57,321 --> 00:22:01,959
AND THEN THE TRAFFIC WAS ON
ANOTHER LEVEL.

320
00:22:01,959 --> 00:22:05,368
OKAY, AND THEN THIS GENIUS CUTS
ME OFF.

321
00:22:05,368 --> 00:22:10,070
AND I'M LIKE, WHY WOULD YOU DO
THAT?

322
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:13,735
>> OKAY, SO HE'S EXACTLY LIKE HE
IS ON TV.

323
00:22:13,735 --> 00:22:16,910
>> SEBASTIAN, I HAVE MISSED YOU,
MAN.
WE'VE GOT TO HANG OUT MORE.

324
00:22:16,910 --> 00:22:17,941
>> IT'S TRUE.

325
00:22:17,941 --> 00:22:22,639
>> ALL RIGHT.
WELL.
I KNOW THIS ISN'T A BACHELORETTE
PARTY, BUT --

326
00:22:22,639 --> 00:22:25,601
>> OH, MY GOD.
>> I THOUGHT WE COULD PLAY A
GAME.

327
00:22:25,601 --> 00:22:30,049
>> YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME.
>> NO, I'M NOT KIDDING,
ACTUALLY.

328
00:22:30,049 --> 00:22:32,433
IT'S A GAME CALLED "GUESS THE
GIRLFRIEND."

329
00:22:32,433 --> 00:22:34,933
>> YOU KNOW WHAT'S A GAME I
DON'T LIKE?

330
00:22:34,933 --> 00:22:38,039
I DON'T LIKE TWISTER, YOU HEARD
OF THIS, TWISTER?

331
00:22:38,039 --> 00:22:41,443
THE GUY GOES, PUT YOUR RIGHT
FOOT ON PELLOW, RIGHT?

332
00:22:41,443 --> 00:22:47,209
AND THEN THE SON OF A BITCH, HE
GOES, LEFT HAND TO PURPLE.

333
00:22:47,209 --> 00:22:51,433
NOW MY HAND IS IN MY RECTUM.

334
00:22:51,433 --> 00:22:56,381
AND I GO, IT'S NOT SUPPOSED TO
BE THERE.

335
00:22:56,381 --> 00:22:59,230
>> YOU ARE COOKING, C-BASS MAN.

336
00:22:59,230 --> 00:23:01,820
IT WAS SO BORING BEFORE YOU GOT
HERE.

337
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:04,200
>> OKAY.
HURTFUL.

338
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:07,055
>> I'M SORRY, HOW DO YOU TWO
KNOW EACH OTHER?

339
00:23:07,055 --> 00:23:10,268
>> OH, WE ACTUALLY WENT TO CAMP
TOGETHER, FOUR YEARS IN A ROW.

340
00:23:10,268 --> 00:23:12,394
>> SOME OF THE BEST TIMES OF MY
LIFE.

341
00:23:12,394 --> 00:23:16,157
>> OKAY.
MAYBE WE SHOULD JUST MOVE PAST
THE GAME PORTION OF THE EVENING.

342
00:23:16,157 --> 00:23:17,024
>> THIS GUY.

343
00:23:17,024 --> 00:23:20,096
>> BECAUSE I KIND OF WANTED TO
MAKE A SPEECH.

344
00:23:20,096 --> 00:23:23,023
I KNOW, THAT SUCKS.
THAT SUCKS.

345
00:23:23,023 --> 00:23:26,969
BUT I DO WANT TO SAY A FEW WORDS
BEFORE YOU OFFICIALLY TIE THE
KNOT.

346
00:23:26,969 --> 00:23:29,527
>> LET ME TELL YOU THE BIGGEST PROBLEM,

347
00:23:29,527 --> 00:23:32,291
THE BIGGEST PROBLEM
WITH TYING THE KNOT, OKAY?

348
00:23:32,291 --> 00:23:37,899
WHEN YOU GOT A BOW, YOU GOT TO
TIE A KNOT AS TIGHT AS YOU CAN.

349
00:23:37,899 --> 00:23:41,114
IF YOU MAKE A MISTAKE, OKAY?

350
00:23:41,114 --> 00:23:44,705
THAT BOW THAT COST YOU HALF YOUR SALARY,

351
00:23:44,705 --> 00:23:48,356
IT'S KISS IT GOOD-BYE.

352
00:23:48,356 --> 00:23:51,786
>> THAT IS EXACTLY WHY I DON'T
HAVE A BOAT

353
00:23:51,786 --> 00:23:54,154
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT
TO KISS IT GOOD-BYE.

354
00:23:54,154 --> 00:23:56,186
>> IT'S BETTER WHEN SEBASTIAN
DOES IT.

355
00:23:56,186 --> 00:23:59,707
>> OKAY, I'M SORRY.
SEBASTIAN, IT'S AWESOME MEETING YOU, MAN,

356
00:23:59,707 --> 00:24:02,178
BUT THIS WEEKEND IS
ABOUT DAVE.

357
00:24:02,178 --> 00:24:04,339
LIKE, HE'S THE ONE GETTING
MARRIED.

358
00:24:04,339 --> 00:24:07,519
>> OH.
YOU WANT SOME MARRIAGE ADVICE?

359
00:24:07,519 --> 00:24:12,453
THE BIGGEST OBSTACLE IS GOING TO
BE THE MOTHER-IN-LAW, OKAY?

360
00:24:12,453 --> 00:24:16,830
AND IT'S NOT THE TYPE OF
OBSTACLE YOU CAN STEP OVER.

361
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:21,499
NO, YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO JUMP
OVER THE MOTHER-IN-LAW.

362
00:24:21,499 --> 00:24:25,958
>> SEBASTIAN, I SWEAR, YOUR BODY
IS A WONDER LAND.
>> THANK YOU.

363
00:24:25,958 --> 00:24:30,636
>> OKAY, GUYS.
SEBASTIAN HAS TOTALLY CHANGED
THE DYNAMIC OF THIS SLEEPOVER.

364
00:24:30,636 --> 00:24:34,246
>> HEY, DON'T DO THAT.
IT'S NOT A SLEEPOVER.

365
00:24:34,246 --> 00:24:38,581
>> I THINK WHAT AUSTIN IS TRYING
TO SAY IS IT'S STARTING TO FEEL
LIKE YOU DON'T REALLY CARE ABOUT US,

366
00:24:38,581 --> 00:24:41,363
YOU ONLY REALLY CARE ABOUT
SEBASTIAN MANISCALO.

367
00:24:41,363 --> 00:24:46,429
>> IF YOU GUYS CAN'T HANG AROUND
WITH ME WHEN I'M AROUND SEBASTIAN,

368
00:24:46,429 --> 00:24:49,278
THEN MAYBE YOU
SHOULDN'T HANG AROUND WITH ME AT
ALL.

369
00:24:49,278 --> 00:24:50,900
>> AND THAT'S FACT.

370
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:55,091
LISTEN.
MY SINCEREST APOLOGIES TO YOU
GUYS.

371
00:24:55,091 --> 00:24:57,581
I JUST HAVEN'T SEEN DAVE IN A
WHILE.

372
00:24:57,581 --> 00:25:01,121
AND THIS GUY, THEY TAUGHT ME
EVERYTHING I KNOW.

373
00:25:01,121 --> 00:25:06,273
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
YOU KNOW, EVER SINCE WE WERE TWO
KIDS AT SUMMER CAMP BACK WHEN WE WOULD BE

374
00:25:06,273 --> 00:25:08,058
PLAYING.

375
00:25:08,058 --> 00:25:10,580
SHOOTING BASKETBALL.

376
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:14,303
WE USED TO LOVE TO SWIM.
WE WERE SWIMMING.

377
00:25:14,303 --> 00:25:17,371
>> PEOPLE DON'T KNOW THIS, BUT
ME AND THIS GUY,

378
00:25:17,371 --> 00:25:19,898
WE WERE LIKE
TWO PEAS IN A POD, YOU
UNDERSTAND?

379
00:25:19,898 --> 00:25:24,196
>> I KNOW I SOUND DIFFERENT NOW,
BUT THAT IS STILL WHO I AM ON
THE INSIDE.

380
00:25:24,196 --> 00:25:27,662
EVERY DAY I HAVE TO QUIET DOWN
MY INNER SEBASTIAN.

381
00:25:27,662 --> 00:25:30,030
I GOT TO PUSH IT DOWN.

382
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:32,479
I GOT TO SAY, NOT NOW.

383
00:25:32,581 --> 00:25:35,398
>> WOW.
SORRY.
WE DIDN'T KNOW THAT.

384
00:25:35,398 --> 00:25:38,965
>> IT'S OKAY.
>> NO WAY FOR YOU TO KNOW THAT.

385
00:25:38,965 --> 00:25:41,487
>> HOW COULD THAT BE?

386
00:25:41,487 --> 00:25:45,681
>> OH, I DID ORDER A STRIPPER.
I SHOULD WARN Y'ALL,

387
00:25:45,681 --> 00:25:47,261
SHE'S
JENNIFER COOLIDGE.

388
00:25:47,261 --> 00:25:52,191
>> OH, WOW!
HI, BOYS!

389
00:25:52,191 --> 00:25:55,084
I CAN'T WAIT TO DANCE FOR YOU.

390
00:25:55,084 --> 00:25:59,630
AND DON'T WORRY.
I STILL GOT A FAT ASS.

391
00:26:35,186 --> 00:26:39,931
SAY
HONORED TO BE HERE IN OSLO,

392
00:26:39,931 --> 00:26:43,647
DIRECTING THIS MOVIE, "SCENT OF
A MARRIAGE."

393
00:26:43,647 --> 00:26:46,206
I AM A HUGE FAN OF NORWEGIAN
FILM.

394
00:26:46,206 --> 00:26:49,259
YOU GUYS TAKE SUCH AN
UNFLINCHING LOOK

395
00:26:49,259 --> 00:26:51,820
AT THE WAYS WE
DEVASTATE EACH OTHER.

396
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:55,128
SO, LET'S GO FOR A TAKE.

397
00:26:55,128 --> 00:26:59,001
>> "SCENT OF A MARRIAGE" SCENE
12 TAKE 1.

398
00:27:01,971 --> 00:27:03,827
>> AND ACTION!

399
00:27:03,827 --> 00:27:06,591
>> YOU THINK YOU LOST ME?

400
00:27:06,591 --> 00:27:09,720
>> PLEASE DON'T ASK ME THAT.

401
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:11,725
>> WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?

402
00:27:11,725 --> 00:27:14,556
WORK AT THE BOOKSTORE TILL
YOU'RE 50?

403
00:27:14,556 --> 00:27:17,601
YOU SHOULD BE WRITING BOOKS, NOT
SELLING THEM.

404
00:27:17,601 --> 00:27:19,985
>> HOW CAN YOU SAY THIS?

405
00:27:19,985 --> 00:27:22,042
EVERYTHING I DO IS FOR OUR SON.

406
00:27:22,042 --> 00:27:24,690
EVERYTHING CHANGED AFTER THE
ACCIDENT.

407
00:27:24,690 --> 00:27:27,203
>> DON'T YOU USE HIM AS AN
EXCUSE.

408
00:27:27,203 --> 00:27:30,319
YOU'RE JUST AFRAID TO EVER WANT
ANYTHING.

409
00:27:30,319 --> 00:27:33,685
>> AND YOU THINK THAT MAKES ME A
COWARD.

410
00:27:33,685 --> 00:27:36,537
>> YOU'RE TOO LAZY TO BE A
COWARD.

411
00:27:36,537 --> 00:27:39,674
A COWARD HAS THE ENERGY TO HIDE.

412
00:27:39,674 --> 00:27:43,096
YOU JUST SIT THERE.

413
00:27:43,096 --> 00:27:44,955
>> AND CUT!

414
00:27:44,955 --> 00:27:47,600
>> OH, MY GOD!
>> OH, MY GOD!

415
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,976
>> THAT WAS INSANE!

416
00:27:49,976 --> 00:27:53,594
>> OKAY!LIKE, THE COOLEST
THING I EVER EXPERIENCED!

417
00:27:53,594 --> 00:27:56,419
>> OKAY, YOU ARE AMAZING AT
ACTING.

418
00:27:56,419 --> 00:27:59,148
I WAS LIKE, WE WERE ON THE SET
FOR THE EMOTION

419
00:27:59,148 --> 00:28:00,858
AND I WAS LIKE,
LET'S RIDE!

420
00:28:00,858 --> 00:28:03,024
>> WE WERE RIDING.
>> WE WILL RIDE.

421
00:28:03,024 --> 00:28:05,082
>> REALLY WOW.
AWESOME.

422
00:28:05,082 --> 00:28:09,220
I DIDN'T EXPECT YOU GUYS TO
HAVE THIS KIND OF ENERGY RIGHT NOW,

423
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:13,249
BUT YEAH, I THINK THAT TAKE
WAS GREAT SO LET'S JUST MOVE ON
TO THE NEXT SCENE IF THAT'S
OKAY?

424
00:28:13,249 --> 00:28:15,631
>> YEAH, SO COOL.
>> SO EFFING COOL.

425
00:28:15,631 --> 00:28:20,297
>> EXCELLENT.
THERE IS WHERE YOU'RE WAITING
FOR YOUR SON TO GET OUT OF THE
HOSPITAL.

426
00:28:20,297 --> 00:28:24,417
>> "SCENT OF A MARRIAGE" SCENE
19 TAKE 1.

427
00:28:24,417 --> 00:28:26,912
>> AND ACTION!

428
00:28:26,912 --> 00:28:29,264
>> I'M SICK OF YOU.

429
00:28:29,264 --> 00:28:31,681
I'M SICK OF YOUR TASTE.

430
00:28:31,681 --> 00:28:34,318
>> HOW WOULD YOU KNOW HOW I
TASTE?

431
00:28:34,318 --> 00:28:39,090
YOU HAVEN'T TOUCHED ME SINCE OUR
SON FELL DOWN THE HILL.

432
00:28:40,308 --> 00:28:43,772
>> TOUCHING YOU IS NOT AN
IMPULSE THAT I HAVE.

433
00:28:43,772 --> 00:28:48,093
>> THAT YOU HAVE.
YOU.
YOU.
YOU.

434
00:28:48,093 --> 00:28:50,927
LISTEN TO YOURSELF.

435
00:28:55,628 --> 00:28:57,717
>> I'M LEAVING YOU.

436
00:28:57,717 --> 00:28:59,635
>> CUT!

437
00:28:59,635 --> 00:29:02,530
>> GUYS, THIS IS SO GOOD!

438
00:29:02,530 --> 00:29:04,849
>> I LOVE THIS SCRIPT!

439
00:29:04,849 --> 00:29:08,004
>> OH, SERIOUSLY, SERIOUSLY,
SERIOUSLY, I HAVE LITTLE
GOOSEBUMPS.

440
00:29:08,004 --> 00:29:09,420
OH, MY GOD, THE GOOSE PIMPLES.

441
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:12,713
RAISE YOUR HAND IF YOU FELT
THAT.
>> ME!

442

I'M MICHAEL CHE.
>> I'M COLIN JOST.

682
00:43:27,683 --> 00:43:31,156
THE LONGEST GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN
IN HISTORY

683
00:43:31,156 --> 00:43:33,533
FINALLY ENDED AFTER 43 DAYS,

684
00:43:33,533 --> 00:43:38,465
AND YOU KNOW FIRST DAY
BACK IN THE OFFICE, YOU GOT TO
CHECK ALL THOSE PILED-UP EMAILS.

685
00:43:38,465 --> 00:43:40,367
EPSTEIN

686
00:43:40,367 --> 00:43:43,824
HOUSE DEMOCRATS RELEASED AN
EMAIL WRITTEN BY JEFFREY EPSTEIN

687
00:43:43,824 --> 00:43:47,650
IN WHICH HE CLAIMS THAT DONALD
TRUMP, QUOTE, KNEW ABOUT THE
GIRLS.

688
00:43:47,650 --> 00:43:52,490
IT'S BOMBSHELL NEWS THAT LEGAL
EXPERTS ARE CALLING DUH.

689
00:43:53,562 --> 00:43:57,466
THIS WEEK'S EPSTEIN DOCUMENTS
ARE OBVIOUSLY VERY DARK AND DISTURBING,

690
00:43:57,466 --> 00:44:00,850
BUT I ALSO THINK
IT'S KIND OF ADORABLE THAT
EPSTEIN'S EMAIL ADDRESS

691
00:44:00,850 --> 00:44:04,440
WAS JEEVACATION@GMAIL.

692
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:09,815
IT'S LIKE IF JEFFREY DAHMER AS
DINNERTIMEJEFF@YAHOO!.

693
00:44:10,661 --> 00:44:15,303
>> IN ONE OF THE EMAILS,
EPSTEIN'S BROTHER ASKED IF
VLADIMIR PUTIN HAS A PICTURE

694
00:44:15,303 --> 00:44:19,318
OF DONALD TRUMP GIVING ORAL SEX TO
SOMEONE NAMED BUBBA.

695
00:44:19,318 --> 00:44:22,096
WHICH WAS AN OLD NICKNAME FOR
BILL CLINTON.

696
00:44:22,096 --> 00:44:26,329
SO I GUESS THAT'S ONE JOB TRUMP
HAS CREATED.

697
00:44:26,856 --> 00:44:29,409
I DON'T KNOW IF THAT ORAL SEX
STORY IS TRUE,

698
00:44:29,409 --> 00:44:31,859
BUT I DO KNOW
THAT IMAGE IS BURNED IN MY
BRAIN.

699
00:44:31,859 --> 00:44:34,448
LIKE THAT SCENE FROM "THE
SHINING."

700
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:39,247
ACCORDING TO ONE RELEASED EMAIL,
JEFFREY EPSTEIN CLAIMED

701
00:44:39,247 --> 00:44:43,282
THAT HE
WAS, QUOTE, THE ONE ABLE TO TAKE
TRUMP DOWN.

702
00:44:43,282 --> 00:44:47,778
WHICH IS PRETTY BIG TALK FOR A
GUY WHO LOST TO A BEDSHEET.

703
00:44:52,776 --> 00:44:57,477
>> I JUST HAVE TO SAY IN GENERAL
I DON'T BELIEVE IN CONSPIRACIES.

704
00:44:57,477 --> 00:44:59,512
BECAUSE AS A MEMBER OF THE
ILLUMINATI --

705
00:44:59,512 --> 00:45:05,137
I KNOW THAT WE, THE LIZARD
PEOPLE, CONTROL EVERYTHING.

706
00:45:05,137 --> 00:45:08,660
AND IT'S REALLY HARD TO BELIEVE
THAT TRUMP WAS SO OBLIVIOUS

707
00:45:08,660 --> 00:45:13,430
 THAT
HE DIDN'T NOTICE HIS GOOD FRIEND
WAS RUNNING AN INTERNATIONAL
PEDOPHILE RING.

708
00:45:13,430 --> 00:45:15,824
THOUGH I GUESS TRUMP IS THE ONE
GUY ON EARTH

709
00:45:15,824 --> 00:45:19,589
 WHO THINKS "YMCA"
IS A STRAIGHT ANTHEM.

710
00:45:19,589 --> 00:45:22,695
ON A BASIC LEVEL, IT'S JUST SHOCKING 

711
00:45:22,695 --> 00:45:26,014
HOW MANY ALLEGED
PEDOPHILES TRUMP WAS FRIENDS
WITH.

712
00:45:26,014 --> 00:45:28,962
EPSTEIN.
PRINCE ANDREW.
AND DIDDY.

713
00:45:28,962 --> 00:45:31,317
I MEAN, THAT'S A LOT, YOU KNOW?

714
00:45:31,317 --> 00:45:34,165
I MEAN, THINK ABOUT YOUR OWN
FRIEND GROUP.
YOU KNOW?

715
00:45:34,165 --> 00:45:36,368
HOW MANY PEDOPHILES DO YOU KNOW?

716
00:45:36,368 --> 00:45:38,751
ONE, MAYBE TWO?

717
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:44,229
BUT TRUMP'S LIKE THE FORREST
GUMP OF MEETING FAMOUS
PEDOPHILES.

718
00:45:45,027 --> 00:45:49,919
>>> THE BILL ENDING THE
GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN WILL FUND
S.N.A.P. THROUGH NEXT SEPTEMBER,

719
00:45:49,919 --> 00:45:54,302
AND THANK GOD, 'CAUSE I WAS THIS
CLOSE TO DONATING FOOD.

720
00:45:55,327 --> 00:45:57,319
>>> PRESIDENT TRUMP -- 

721
00:45:57,319 --> 00:46:01,109
PRESIDENT TRUMP ATTENDED A WASHINGTON
COMMANDERS GAME ON SUNDAY, 

722
00:46:01,109 --> 00:46:05,727
AND I
GUESS HE HASN'T BEEN TO ONE IN A
WHILE BECAUSE HE SHOWED UP IN
REDSKIN.

723
00:46:09,034 --> 00:46:13,630
>>> IT WAS ALSO REPORTED THAT
PRESIDENT TRUMP TOLD THE OWNERS
OF THE WASHINGTON COMMANDERS

724
00:46:13,630 --> 00:46:16,840
THAT HE WANTS THEIR NEW STADIUM
TO BE NAMED IN HIS HONOR.

725
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:20,545
SO SAY HELLO TO THE DEMENTIA
DOME.

726
00:46:21,607 --> 00:46:24,783
>>> IN A NEW INTERVIEW,
PRESIDENT TRUMP DENIED ONLINE RUMORS 

727
00:46:24,783 --> 00:46:29,340
THAT THE GOLD DECORATIONS
IN THE OVAL OFFICE CAME FROM
HOME DEPOT.

728
00:46:29,340 --> 00:46:35,269
EVEN THOUGH HE HAS A WHOLE TEAM
OF GUYS TAKING STUFF FROM HOME
DEPOT ALL THE TIME.

729
00:46:37,602 --> 00:46:41,052
THIS IS MY FAVORITE EPISODE.

730
00:46:41,204 --> 00:46:45,701
>>> PRESIDENT TRUMP IS
THREATENING TO SUE THE BBC FOR $5 BILLION

731
00:46:45,701 --> 00:46:50,844
 FOR A DOCUMENTARY
THAT EDITED OUT THE PART OF HIS
JANUARY 6th SPEECH 

732
00:46:50,844 --> 00:46:53,531
WHERE HE
CALLED FOR PROTESTERS TO BE
PEACEFUL.

733
00:46:53,531 --> 00:46:56,694
AND TO SET THE RECORD STRAIGHT,
HERE IS THE FULL, UNEDITED,

734
00:46:56,694 --> 00:47:00,193
COMPLETELY ACCURATE CLIP OF WHAT
TRUMP SAID ON THAT DAY.

735
00:47:00,193 --> 00:47:04,506
>> EVERYBODY KNOWS, I WENT DOWN
ON BILL CLINTON.

736
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:19,718
>> YEAH, EVERYONE WANTS TO SEE
IT.

737
00:47:20,605 --> 00:47:25,024
>>> ASTRONAUTS ON THE
INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION ARE
TESTING A NEW PROCESS

738
00:47:25,024 --> 00:47:27,562
 THAT MAKES
FOOD USING THEIR OWN URINE.
