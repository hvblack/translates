00:00:00,566 --> 00:00:05,263
>>> AND NOW A SPECIAL MOTHER'S
DAY MESSAGE FROM THE CAST OF
SNL.

2
00:00:09,531 --> 00:00:12,390
>> GOOD EVENING, EVERYBODY.

3
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:16,340
I AM HERE TONIGHT WITH MY MOMMY,
ANN.

4
00:00:17,689 --> 00:00:22,294
BECAUSE, AS YOU KNOW, IT IS
MOTHER'S DAY IN ABOUT 29
MINUTES.

5
00:00:22,373 --> 00:00:25,229
>> SO STILL PLENTY OF TIME TO
BUY A GIFT.

6
00:00:25,229 --> 00:00:28,089
>> I TOLD YOU, MOM, MY CHILDREN
ARE MY GIFT TO YOU.

7
00:00:28,089 --> 00:00:31,766
>> SO ME BABY SITTING THEM IS MY
GIFT?

8
00:00:31,766 --> 00:00:33,535
HOW GENEROUS.

9
00:00:33,535 --> 00:00:37,117
>> ANYWAY, WITH SO MANY
UPSETTING STORIES IN THE WORLD RIGHT NOW,

10
00:00:37,117 --> 00:00:39,565
WE THOUGHT WE WOULD
TAKE A BREAK FROM A REGULAR COLD OPEN

11
00:00:39,565 --> 00:00:42,609
AND HEAR SOME HEART-WARMING
STORIES FROM OUR MOMS INSTEAD.

12
00:00:42,687 --> 00:00:44,889
>> REALLY?
THAT'S TOO BAD.

13
00:00:44,889 --> 00:00:48,236
I WAS EXCITED TO SEE WHO WAS
GOING TO PLAY STORMY DANIELS.

14
00:00:48,236 --> 00:00:50,223
>> ALL RIGHT.
COME ON.

15
00:00:50,223 --> 00:00:54,225
>> MOM, I LOVE YOU, AND I'M SO
GRATEFUL FOR EVERYTHING YOU'VE
DONE FOR ME.

16
00:00:54,225 --> 00:00:56,148
>> WELL, THANKS, ANDREW.

17
00:00:56,226 --> 00:00:59,144
I BROUGHT PHOTOS.
>> YOU WHAT?

18
00:00:59,144 --> 00:01:03,893
>> HERE'S ONE OF ANDREW IN THE
BATHTUB WHEN HE WAS 3.

19
00:01:03,893 --> 00:01:08,620
AND I ALSO BROUGHT ONE OF ANDREW
IN THE BATHTUB WHEN HE WAS 23.

20
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:09,967
>> ALL RIGHT, MOM.
THANKS FOR COMING.

21
00:01:09,967 --> 00:01:12,591
>> IT'S A TASTEFUL NUDE.

22
00:01:12,591 --> 00:01:15,570
>> MOM, I'M SO EXCITED YOU'RE
HERE TONIGHT.

23
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:19,910
>> ME TOO, CHLOE.
CAN YOU BELIEVE IT?
I'M AT THE ROAST OF TOM BRADY.

24
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:22,476
>> NO, NO.
MOM, THAT WAS ON SUNDAY.

25
00:01:22,476 --> 00:01:25,645
>> CAN I STILL DO MY JOKE?
>> I GUESS.

26
00:01:25,645 --> 00:01:30,471
>> TOM BRADY'S MARRIAGE FINISHED
SO QUICKLY, I THOUGHT IT WAS
YOUR DAD.

27
00:01:30,964 --> 00:01:33,938
>> MOM!
OH, MY GOD!

28
00:01:34,345 --> 00:01:37,716
>> HEY, GUYS.
THIS IS MY MOM, MARY.

29
00:01:37,716 --> 00:01:40,123
>> HEY, EVERYONE.

30
00:01:40,123 --> 00:01:43,806
>> MY MOM IS MORE THAN JUST A
MOM.
SHE'S LIKE A SUPERMOM.

31
00:01:43,806 --> 00:01:46,254
>> AND YOU'RE LIKE A SUPER
DAUGHTER.

32
00:01:46,254 --> 00:01:48,759
BECAUSE YOU'RE SWEET, YOU'RE FUNNY,

33
00:01:48,759 --> 00:01:53,793
AND YOU'RE STRONGER THAN
ANY MAN I'VE EVER MET.
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

34
00:01:57,003 --> 00:02:00,540
>> I'M SO PROUD OF YOU, HONEY.
>> AW, THANKS, MOM.

35
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:03,316
IS THERE ANYTHING SPECIAL YOU
WANT FOR MOTHER'S DAY?

36
00:02:03,316 --> 00:02:06,540
>> YOU KNOW, YOU'VE ALREADY
GIVEN ME THE GREATEST GIFT OF ALL,

37
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:08,918
THAT BEAVIS AND BUTT-HEAD SKETCH,

38
00:02:08,918 --> 00:02:12,331
EVERYONE KNOWS ME AS
BUTT-HEAD'S MOM.

39
00:02:12,331 --> 00:02:15,675
>> BUTT-HEAD'S MOM, YEAH, NICE.

40
00:02:15,675 --> 00:02:18,200

42
00:02:22,174 --> 00:02:24,776
IT'S THE BEST PART OF MY SUNDAY.

43
00:02:24,776 --> 00:02:27,674
>> WAIT.

44
00:02:27,674 --> 00:02:30,969

45
00:02:31,242 --> 00:02:35,490
I MEAN, SATURDAYS I'M IN THE
CLUB.

46
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:41,101
>> WELL, MOM, YOU ALWAYS ASKED
WHAT IT'S LIKE TO WEAR A BALD
CAP ON THE SHOW.

47
00:02:41,487 --> 00:02:44,699
>> NOW I KNOW.

48
00:02:44,699 --> 00:02:49,194
AND IT'S

51
00:02:55,923 --> 00:02:57,885

52
00:02:57,885 --> 00:03:01,083
>> RIGHT.
EXCEPT THE STUFF THAT BOMBS.

53
00:03:01,083 --> 00:03:04,069

MM, CORN.

59
00:03:17,034 --> 00:03:21,510

>> WANT TO SEE ME DO AN
IMPRESSION?

63
00:03:32,194 --> 00:03:36,420

GAME BOY, AND THIS IS WHAT YOU
DID.

64
00:03:37,218 --> 00:03:39,236
COME

65
00:03:39,236 --> 00:03:41,516
>> MOM, I'M SO HAPPY YOU'RE

YOU GREW UP SO FAST,

67
00:03:45,917 --> 00:03:48,222
BUT NOT SO

68
00:03:48,962 --> 00:03:50,486

72
00:04:00,793 --> 00:04:03,048

NUMBER.

73
00:04:03,048 --> 00:04:06,009
>> OKAY.
MY MOM, EVERYBODY.
THANK YOU.

74
00:04:08,891 --> 00:04:11,689

00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:17,473
I NEED TO FIND LORNE MICHALES AND SAY
THANK YOU.

77
00:04:17,473 --> 00:04:20,198
WITHOUT HIM, WHERE WOULD YOU BE?

78
00:04:20,198 --> 00:04:24,309
A DOCTOR AT A HOSPITAL?

79
00:04:24,309 --> 00:04:27,148
THANKS A LOT, LORNE.

80
00:04:28,788 --> 00:04:32,754
>> MOM, CAN YOU BELIEVE I'M ON
SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE?

81
00:04:32,754 --> 00:04:36,321
>> HONESTLY, NO.
I ALWAYS HOPED YOU WOULD BE ON
JACK ASS.

82
00:04:36,321 --> 00:04:40,360
BUT THIS IS YOUR WEEK TO SHINE.
>> WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

83
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:44,378
>> RFK JR. SAID THEY FOUND A
WORM IN HIS BRAIN.
YOU COULD BE THE WORM.

84
00:04:44,378 --> 00:04:46,933
>> OH, THANKS, MOM.

85
00:04:47,328 --> 00:04:49,823
>> AND WE'RE ONLY SORT OF IN THE CAST,

86
00:04:49,823 --> 00:04:53,392
 SO THEY WOULD ONLY LET US
INVITE OUR DADS.

87
00:04:56,384 --> 00:04:59,617
>> DAD, YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO
SMOKE IN HERE.

88
00:05:00,372 --> 00:05:05,152
>> WILL YOU JUST RELAX?
IT'S JUST CRACK.

89
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:08,619
>> WELL, MOM, WE'RE LAST.

90
00:05:08,834 --> 00:05:10,799
BECAUSE WE RAN OUT OF TIME 

91
00:05:10,799 --> 00:05:14,803
AND WE HAD TO CUT COLIN AND HIS MOM
AND MATCHING HAIR CUTS.

92
00:05:16,403 --> 00:05:20,955
>> WAIT A MINUTE.
IF I DON'T HAVE A LINE, I DON'T
GET PAID.

93
00:05:20,955 --> 00:05:25,736
>> WELL, HOW DO YOU THINK I
FEEL?
I MEAN, I SPENT DAYS GROWING
THIS OUT.

94
00:05:25,736 --> 00:05:29,373
>> WELL, MOM, DO YOU HAVE AN
UPLIFTING MESSAGE FROM THE MOMS
TO LEAVE ON?

95
00:05:29,373 --> 00:05:32,545
>> I DO.
WE ARE FROM ALL OVER THE COUNTRY,

96
00:05:32,545 --> 00:05:36,178
POLIITICAL SPECTRUM

97
00:05:36,178 --> 00:05:38,598
 BUT WE HAVE ONE THING
IN COMMON.

98
00:05:38,598 --> 00:05:41,982
WE LOVE OUR CHILDREN WITH ALL
OUR HEART.

99
00:05:41,982 --> 00:05:44,177
>> OH, WOW, THAT'S REALLY SWEET,
MOM.

100
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:47,070
>> I HAVE A TOM BRADY JOKE TOO.

101
00:05:47,413 --> 00:05:52,373
TOM BRADY IS SO HANDSOME, HE
SHOULD GIVE ME A CALL.

102
00:05:52,373 --> 00:05:54,977
>> MOM, YOU'RE MARRIED TO DAD!

103
00:05:54,977 --> 00:05:59,123
>> IT'S A MOTHER'S DAY HALL
PASS.

104
00:05:59,123 --> 00:06:01,820
>> OKAY.
EVERYBODY GETS ONE.

105
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,775
EVERYBODY GET BACK ON STAGE.

106
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:07,591
HAPPY MOTHER'S DAY FROM EVERYONE

AND FOR ME, IT'S EXTRA SPECIAL

114
00:09:05,298 --> 00:09:08,656
BECAUSE I AM A FOUR-TIME MOM.

115
00:09:09,328 --> 00:09:12,119
THAT'S RIGHT.
I HAVE FOUR BEAUTIFUL KIDS --

116
00:09:12,119 --> 00:09:13,838
THAT I KNOW OF.

117
00:09:13,838 --> 00:09:15,316

118
00:09:15,316 --> 00:09:17,468
>> BOWEN, SARAH, HEY GUYS.

119

YOU'RE MOTHER.

121
00:09:28,049 --> 00:09:30,300
>> YOU'RE A 30 ROCK LEGEND.

122
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:34,121
YOU'VE HAD YOUR FOOT ON OUR
NECKS SINCE Y2K.

123

TERRESTRIAL MOTHER STATUS.

126
00:09:44,492 --> 00:09:47,478

00:09:48,469 --> 00:09:50,689
YOU'RE RIGHT.

128
00:09:51,911 --> 00:09:55,849

129
00:09:55,849 --> 00:09:58,302
WE DID NOT COME TO PLAY WITH YOU
HOES.

130
00:09:58,302 --> 00:10:01,268
WE CAME TO SLAY, BITCH.

131
00:10:01,268 --> 00:10:04,514
AND ALSO DO SOME COMEDY BITS.

132
00:10:04,514 --> 00:10:07,636
OH, YES.
THIS IS MAYA'S HOUSE NOW.

133
00:10:07,636 --> 00:10:11,265

REMEMBER IN THAT MOVIE WHEN I
POOPED MY PANTS?

138
00:10:29,891 --> 00:10:31,767
WHEN YOU WERE A BABY YOU POOPED
YOUR PANTS,

139
00:10:31,767 --> 00:10:34,316
 AND I CHANGED YOUR

CAN'T FIX.

493
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:16,060
BUT AS FOR ME MYSELF PERSONALLY,

494

I HAVE OFFICIALLY ENDURED BY

BREAK IT UP, THEY TURNED ON ME.

516

I'M OUT.

520

521
00:24:05,478 --> 00:24:10,181
PACKET OF CRYSTAL LIGHT IN MY

522
00:24:10,883 --> 00:24:13,350

COULDN'T AFFORD LEMONADE.

527
00:24:20,526 --> 00:24:22,393

A GO FUND ME TO HELP ME BUY

529

OUTLANDISH CLAIMS TO A FEMALE

PERUSES THE LOCAL ART.

638
00:29:25,598 --> 00:29:28,232
SHE'S INTERRUPTED, THOUGH, BY A

639
00:29:28,234 --> 00:29:34,505
PEACOCKING YOUNG MALE FROM THE

640

GENUS AMICUS McJAGGEROUS.

00:29:41,614 --> 00:29:44,515
SHE GIVES A BEAUTIFUL SMILE.

643
00:29:44,517 --> 00:29:45,182
AND NOW, SOMETHING AMAZING

644

HAPPENS.

645
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:48,418
THE TOUGHEST MEMBER OF THE TRIBE

646
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:52,089
HAS JUST CREATED FIRE.

647
00:29:52,091 --> 00:29:53,590
SHORTLY AFTER, HE'S ALSO THE

648
00:29:53,592 --> 00:29:54,324
FIRST TO DISCOVER THAT FIRE IS

649
00:29:54,326 --> 00:30:00,030
HOT.

650
00:30:00,032 --> 00:30:02,065
REFUSING TO SHOW PAIN, HE KEEPS

651
00:30:02,067 --> 00:30:04,635
A STIFF UPPER LIP.

652
00:30:04,637 --> 00:30:09,106
THE PAIN INTENSIFIES.

653
00:30:09,108 --> 00:30:12,809
HE LETS OUT A SMALL WHIMPER.

654
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:15,245
AT LAST, THE AGONY IS SO GREAT,

655
00:30:15,247 --> 00:30:17,915
IT INSPIRES HIM TO UTTER THE

656
00:30:17,917 --> 00:30:18,715
FIRST MODERN PHRASE.

657

OF LYING ABOUT THEIR AFFAIR FOR

816

THE MOVIES THAT SHE'S WORKED ON.

834
00:39:10,432 --> 00:39:12,832
AFTER SHE FINISHED, THE JUDGE

835
00:39:12,834 --> 00:39:15,068
BANGED THE GAVEL AND OPENED ORAL

836
00:39:15,070 --> 00:39:16,736
ARGUMENTS -- WERE THE NAMES OF

837
00:39:16,738 --> 00:39:17,670
THE MOVIES.

838
00:39:17,672 --> 00:39:18,004
OH, MAN.

839
00:39:18,006 --> 00:39:21,574

HIS FIFTH TURN AND SWORN IN BY

877

THE RUSSIAN CONSTITUTION, WHICH

878
00:40:48,196 --> 00:40:53,666

886
00:41:05,714 --> 00:41:07,347
AN INSANE THING TO PROBABLY BE

887

RIGHT ABOUT.

888
00:41:07,883 --> 00:41:09,182
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

889

OKAY.

IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE NOW A HUGE

00:41:36,311 --> 00:41:38,077
FAN OF RFK JR.?

905
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:38,578

HIS FACE IS SO RED, HE LOOKS

915
00:41:56,064 --> 00:41:57,630
LIKE YOU WHEN YOU'RE SCREAMING

916
00:41:57,632 --> 00:41:58,331
AT THOSE COLLEGE PROTESTORS,

917

HOW DID YOU GET INTO HIS BRAIN

922
00:42:08,276 --> 00:42:09,175
IN THE FIRST PLACE?

923
00:42:09,177 --> 00:42:11,978

THROUGH THE ANUS.

928
00:42:19,788 --> 00:42:22,722
BUT LOOK, RFK'S BODY WAS A

929
00:42:22,724 --> 00:42:23,556
WORM'S PARADISE.

I WAS IN THAT GUY'S BRAIN TOO.

947
00:43:00,328 --> 00:43:01,160
I ATE THE PART THAT UNDERSTOOD

948
00:43:01,162 --> 00:43:05,231
THE WORD NO.

949
00:43:05,233 --> 00:43:05,531

00:45:05,587 --> 00:45:06,452
I DON'T KNOW WHY I THOUGHT YOU

1006
00:45:07,021 --> 00:45:09,489

BABIES.

1023
00:45:46,327 --> 00:45:47,093
I BELIEVE THAT WAS ALSO THE

1024
00:45:47,095 --> 00:45:51,030
THEME OF THE MET GALA.

1025
00:45:51,032 --> 00:45:53,232
ONLINE CRITICS SAID THE DRESS

GALA HAD SUCH A TIGHT WAIST THAT

1028
00:45:58,439 --> 00:45:59,872
IT SEEMED LIKE IT WAS CRUSHED

1029
00:45:59,874 --> 00:46:01,274
HER ORGANS.

1030
00:46:01,276 --> 00:46:03,209
BUT I ALREADY WATCHED HER ORGANS

1031
00:46:03,211 --> 00:46:08,648
GET CRUSHED BY RAY JAY.

1032
00:46:08,650 --> 00:46:09,415
I DON'T THINK THAT'S GOING TO

1033
00:46:09,417 --> 00:46:10,550
MAKE THE SHOW.

1034
00:46:10,552 --> 00:46:11,818
>> I THINK IT DID.

1035
00:46:11,820 --> 00:46:15,488

1042
00:46:35,143 --> 00:46:35,875
HE WAS EVENTUALLY SUBDUED BY A

1043
00:46:35,877 --> 00:46:40,179

MOVIE SEASON, WHICH BETTER BE A

1049

ONE-TIME THING BECAUSE A LOT OF

1050

PEOPLE RELY ON MARVEL MOVIES TO

1051

PAY FOR THE FERRIES THEY BOUGHT.

1052

BRUNCH.

1088
00:48:19,781 --> 00:48:22,648
THE SUNGLASSES WERE JUST TO BE

1089
00:48:22,650 --> 00:48:22,949
FUNNY.

1090
00:48:22,951 --> 00:48:25,384

1109
00:49:00,321 --> 00:49:01,954
ARE YOU INSANE RIGHT NOW?

1110

BED.

1116
00:49:09,597 --> 00:49:10,096
>> LOST MY SHIRT.

1117
00:49:10,098 --> 00:49:12,965
GREAT IDEA.

1118
00:49:12,967 --> 00:49:15,501

I'M GOOD.

1122
00:49:18,840 --> 00:49:19,438
>> YOU DON'T SEEM GOOD.

1123
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:19,772

THIS WAS MY PROM DRESS.

1129
00:49:29,884 --> 00:49:30,750

YOU HAVEN'T SAID A WORD TO ME.

1135
00:49:38,526 --> 00:49:40,559

1136
00:49:40,561 --> 00:49:43,462
>> OKAY.

1137
00:49:43,464 --> 00:49:44,630

OF ALL, I BELIEVE, IS HONESTY.

1154
00:50:16,497 --> 00:50:19,665
DON'T LIE TO A WOMAN AND TELL

1155
00:50:19,667 --> 00:50:24,370
HER SHE'S HOSTING SNL AND THEN

1156
00:50:24,372 --> 00:50:28,441
JUST HAVE HER ON THE WORST PART

1157
00:50:28,443 --> 00:50:33,846
OF THE SHOW, "WEEKEND UPDATE."

1158
00:50:33,848 --> 00:50:35,381
>> THAT'S WHY YOU'RE MAD?

1159
00:50:35,383 --> 00:50:37,550
YOU THOUGHT YOU WERE HOSTING?

1160
