1
00:00:02,003 --> 00:00:05,439
"CHEERS"IS FILMED BEFORE
A LIVE STUDIO AUDIENCE.

2
00:00:06,475 --> 00:00:08,884
HEY, HOW ABOUT
A COUPLE OF BEERS?

3
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:12,512
I'M AFRAID I'M GONNA
HAVE TO SEE SOME I.D.

4
00:00:15,989 --> 00:00:18,376
ALL RIGHTY, THANK YOU.

5
00:00:18,376 --> 00:00:20,286
NOW IF I COULD SEE
YOUR, PLEASE?

6
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:29,968
WHY DON'T WE
JUST FORGET ABOUT IT?
LET'S JUST GET OUT OF HERE.

7
00:00:29,898 --> 00:00:35,486
GUYS, BEFORE YOU RUN
SCREAMING FROM HERE,
LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING.

8
00:00:35,486 --> 00:00:37,989
THIS FRIEND OF MINE
IS HAVING TWINS.

9
00:00:37,989 --> 00:00:39,923
ALL RIGHT, IT'S ME.

10
00:00:39,923 --> 00:00:45,052
NOW I DON'T CARE
IF THEY CALL EACH OTHER
CUTE LITTLE NAMES,
LIKE CHIPPER AND SKIPPER,

11
00:00:45,052 --> 00:00:49,553
OR IF THEY PRETEND TO BE
EACH OTHER,
MAKE THEIR TEACHERS' LIVES
A LIVING HELL.

12
00:00:49,553 --> 00:00:53,711
BUT, SEE,
WHAT WORRIES ME
IS THAT THEY'LL HAVE ESP,

13
00:00:53,711 --> 00:00:57,741
AND THEY'LL COMMUNICATE
SILENT, EVIL THOUGHTS,

14
00:00:57,741 --> 00:01:00,631
AND I WON'T KNOW WHAT
THEY'RE SAYING ABOUT ME.

15
00:01:00,762 --> 00:01:03,236
YOU THINK THAT'S WEIRD?

16
00:01:07,468 --> 00:01:10,887
- WELL?
- WE'RE DISCUSSING IT.

17
00:01:21,384 --> 00:01:24,063
* MAKING YOUR WAY
IN THE WORLD TODAY *

18
00:01:24,063 --> 00:01:26,875
* TAKES EVERYTHING
YOU'VE GOT *

19
00:01:26,875 --> 00:01:29,873
* TAKING A BREAK
FROM ALL YOUR WORRIES *

20
00:01:29,873 --> 00:01:32,682
* SURE WOULD HELP A LOT *

21
00:01:33,182 --> 00:01:37,134
* WOULDN'T YOU LIKE
TO GET AWAY? *

22
00:01:38,673 --> 00:01:41,097
* SOMETIMES
YOU WANT TO GO *

23
00:01:41,097 --> 00:01:45,361
* WHERE EVERYBODY
KNOWS YOUR NAME *

24
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:50,586
* AND THEY'RE ALWAYS
GLAD YOU CAME *

25
00:01:50,945 --> 00:01:53,581
* YOU WANT TO BE
WHERE YOU CAN SEE *

26
00:01:53,581 --> 00:01:56,108
* OUR TROUBLES
ARE ALL THE SAME *

27
00:01:56,108 --> 00:02:00,969
* YOU WANT TO BE WHERE
EVERYBODY KNOWS YOUR NAME *

28
00:02:01,339 --> 00:02:03,891
* YOU WANT TO GO
WHERE PEOPLE KNOW *

29
00:02:03,891 --> 00:02:06,403
* PEOPLE ARE ALL THE SAME *

30
00:02:06,403 --> 00:02:11,461
* YOU WANT TO GO WHERE
EVERYBODY KNOWS YOUR NAME *

31
00:02:30,418 --> 00:02:32,510
HEY, LISTEN UP, EVERYBODY.

32
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:35,499
CLIFFORD CLAVIN HAS DECIDED
TO MAKE A MAJOR LIFE CHANGE.

33
00:02:35,499 --> 00:02:38,576
DON'T BOTHER. YOU'D BE
A DORKY WOMAN, TOO.

34
00:02:39,938 --> 00:02:42,540
YEAH, THAT'S
A GOOD ONE, CARLA.

35
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:45,076
ALL RIGHT, CLIFFIE.
WHAT'S UP, BUD?

36
00:02:45,076 --> 00:02:47,746
THERE'S A NEW CONDO
COMPLEX GOING UP ON MY ROUTE.

37
00:02:47,746 --> 00:02:49,681
YOU KNOW, ONE OF THOSE
PLACES FILLED WITH, UH,

38
00:02:49,681 --> 00:02:51,904
BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE HAVING
THE TIME OF THEIR LIVES.

39
00:02:51,904 --> 00:02:53,902
I SAID TO MYSELF,
"CLIFFORD C,

40
00:02:53,902 --> 00:02:56,587
"YOU'D TAKE TO THAT PLACE
LIKE A FISH TAKES TO WATER."

41
00:02:56,587 --> 00:02:59,752
ALL SLIMY AND WITH YOUR
EYES BULGING OUT?

42
00:03:01,192 --> 00:03:04,851
SHOULDN'T YOU BE SQUATTING
IN A FIELD SOMEWHERE, CARLA?

43
00:03:09,734 --> 00:03:12,436
WELL, TO MAKE
A LONG STORY SHORT,

44
00:03:12,436 --> 00:03:15,941
I AM BOSTON'S
NEWEST HOMEOWNER.
I BOUGHT A CONDO.

45
00:03:15,941 --> 00:03:18,793
WAIT. THAT MEANS
YOU'RE MOVING OUT ON ME?

46
00:03:18,793 --> 00:03:20,873
NORMIE, I CAN'T LIVE
WITH YOU FOREVER.

47
00:03:20,873 --> 00:03:22,557
YOU CAN'T DO THAT.

48
00:03:22,557 --> 00:03:24,816
WHO'S GONNA MIX
VERA'S COCOA?

49
00:03:24,816 --> 00:03:26,668
WHO'S GONNA
RUB HER FEET?

50
00:03:26,668 --> 00:03:28,951
WHO'S GONNA
TALK TO HER?

51
00:03:28,951 --> 00:03:32,991
NORMIE, I'M AFRAID
YOU'RE JUST GOING TO, UH,
HAVE TO PICK UP THE SLACK

52
00:03:32,991 --> 00:03:36,060
NO!
NO, NO, NO.
NOT ME.

53
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:39,130
MAYBE I CAN
HIRE SOME
HIGH SCHOOL KID.

54
00:03:44,235 --> 00:03:46,465
DID EVERYBODY SEE THAT?

55
00:03:46,465 --> 00:03:49,473
YES, I'VE STARTED
SMOKING AGAIN.

56
00:03:49,473 --> 00:03:53,462
I'VE BEEN UNDER
A LOT OF PRESSURE,
AND I NEEDED SOMETHING TO
CALM MY NERVES, ALL RIGHT?

57
00:03:53,462 --> 00:03:57,648
AND I DON'T WANT TO HEAR
ANY STUPID REMARKS
ABOUT YELLOW FINGERNAILS
OR KISSING ASHTRAYS.

58
00:03:57,648 --> 00:04:00,835
AND IF YOU USE THE PHRASE
"COFFIN NAILS,"
YOU BETTER BE
A MORTICIAN.

59
00:04:00,835 --> 00:04:04,437
ANY QUESTIONS, COMMENTS?
SNIDE REMARKS? NO? GOOD!

60
00:04:05,323 --> 00:04:08,440
WELL, IT CERTAINLY
HAS CALMED HER DOWN.

61
00:04:10,133 --> 00:04:12,042
UH, EXCUSE ME.

62
00:04:12,042 --> 00:04:15,834
YOU KNOW, I OUGHT
TO APOLOGIZE.
I FEEL LIKE THIS
IS MY FAULT.

63
00:04:15,834 --> 00:04:16,801
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

64
00:04:16,801 --> 00:04:18,602
WELL, OBVIOUSLY YOU STARTED
SMOKING AGAIN

65
00:04:18,602 --> 00:04:22,371
BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT
SOME SORT OF
PENT-UP SEXUAL FRUSTRATION
GOING ON.

66
00:04:22,371 --> 00:04:26,514
AND I DON'T THINK
WE HAVE TO TELL EACH OTHER
WHO'S RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT,
NOW, DO WE?

67
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:30,922
HEY, COME ON, I'M JUST TRYING
TO HELP HERE, YOU KNOW?

68
00:04:30,922 --> 00:04:35,169
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU OUGHT TO DO
IS YOU OUGHT TO
COME ON OVER TO DR. SAMMY'S
STOP SMOKING CENTER.

69
00:04:35,169 --> 00:04:38,413
TODAY'S SPECIAL
IS A FREE CHEST EXAM.

70
00:04:40,624 --> 00:04:44,928
SAM, IS THIS ONE OF
THOSE TWO-WEEK PROGRAMS
WITH A SIMPLE
TWO-DAY FOLLOW-UP?

71
00:04:54,435 --> 00:04:57,785
AW, THOSE GUYS.

72
00:04:59,344 --> 00:05:01,107
COME ON IN.

73
00:05:05,284 --> 00:05:10,379
WHAT A SURPRISE,
YOU GUYS.
WELCOME TO CHEZ CLIFF.

74
00:05:10,655 --> 00:05:12,691
SOUNDS LIKE
PARTY CENTRAL
OUT THERE.

75
00:05:12,691 --> 00:05:17,441
WELL, I JUST HOPE THAT
THEY CAN KEEP UP
WITH THE CHAIRMAN
OF THE BROADS.

76
00:05:19,697 --> 00:05:23,201
HEY, CLIFFIE,
I BROUGHT YOU
THE TRADITIONAL
HOUSEWARMING GIFT.

77
00:05:23,201 --> 00:05:27,185
- OH, A SIX-PACK.
- UH, THE FIVE-PACK.

78
00:05:30,875 --> 00:05:34,201
WELL, SO, YOU GUYS READY
FOR THE GRAND TOUR?

79
00:05:34,201 --> 00:05:35,417
OK.

80
00:05:35,417 --> 00:05:39,217
YEP. RIGHT HERE
WE HAVE THE LIVING ROOM.

81
00:05:40,585 --> 00:05:43,271
RIGHT OVER HERE
IS THE BEDROOM.

82
00:05:43,888 --> 00:05:46,231
HEY, SLOW DOWN. LET ME
CATCH MY BREATH HERE.

83
00:05:46,231 --> 00:05:48,860
WHOA!
I ALMOST FORGOT
THE KITCHEN.

84
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:51,295
I THINK THE BUILDER
DID, TOO.

85
00:05:51,562 --> 00:05:56,700
LET ME PUT THESE BEERS
ON ICE HERE.
YEAH, GOOD IDEA.

86
00:05:56,770 --> 00:05:58,569
IT'S NOT TOO COLD
IN HERE, BUDDY.

87
00:05:58,569 --> 00:06:02,809
YEAH, YEAH,
I NOTICED THAT,
NORMIE.
I THINK IT'S THE
AMALGAMATOR VALVE.

88
00:06:02,809 --> 00:06:05,627
I'VE BEEN MEANING
TO STRIP IT DOWN,
CHECK OUT
THE ENGINE,
YOU KNOW,

89
00:06:05,627 --> 00:06:08,980
I THINK
I BETTER PUT IN
SOME MORE FREON
IN THE REGULATOR,
TOO.

90
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:12,150
OR ELSE YOU CAN JUST TURN
THIS LITTLE DIAL TO "COLD."

91
00:06:13,418 --> 00:06:17,298
WELL, YEAH,
IF YOU WANT TO TAKE
A STOPGAP APPROACH.

92
00:06:17,298 --> 00:06:21,059
- DID YOU NOTICE THE POOL
ON YOUR WAY IN?
- YEAH.
YEAH.

93
00:06:21,059 --> 00:06:26,876
SO WHEN SUMMER ROLLS AROUND
AND ALL THOSE GIRLS
ARE OUT THERE IN THEIR
FRENCH-CUT BIKINIS,

94
00:06:26,876 --> 00:06:28,481
I DON'T HAVE TO TELL YOU
WHERE I'LL BE.

95
00:06:28,481 --> 00:06:31,863
- STANDING RIGHT HERE WITH
A PAIR OF BINOCULARS?
- THAT'S RIGHT.

96
00:06:32,103 --> 00:06:36,057
BOY, OH, BOY.
HEY, THANKS FOR COMING BY,
GUYS, BUT...

97
00:06:36,057 --> 00:06:38,843
YOU KNOW, I DON'T MEAN
TO BE RUDE, BUT...

98
00:06:38,843 --> 00:06:40,578
I GOTTA ASK YOU
TO SKEDADDLE.

99
00:06:40,578 --> 00:06:43,815
I'VE GOT SOMEBODY
SOFT AND SWEET,

100
00:06:43,815 --> 00:06:46,551
WITH A VOICE LIKE
A NIGHTINGALE
COMING OVER.

101
00:06:46,551 --> 00:06:49,624
THE BUSBOY FROM MELVILLE'S
IS COMING OVER HERE?

102
00:06:50,855 --> 00:06:54,826
NO, WOODY.
REUBEN'S NOT COMING
OVER HERE.

103
00:06:54,826 --> 00:06:57,996
IT'S ONE OF THE WOMEN
IN THE BUILDING.

104
00:06:57,996 --> 00:07:02,005
WAIT A MINUTE,
CLIFFIE.
ARE WE ACTUALLY
TALKING A FEMALE?

105
00:07:02,005 --> 00:07:05,369
I MEAN A REAL, LIVE,
BREATHING WOMAN?

106
00:07:05,369 --> 00:07:09,105
THREE-DIMENSIONAL?
NO POSTERS,
NO POLYURETHANE?

107
00:07:09,156 --> 00:07:13,978
NO, NORMIE.
SALLY IS THE REAL McCOY,

108
00:07:13,978 --> 00:07:16,037
AND SHE'S ONE
GORGEOUS BABE TO BOOT.

109
00:07:16,037 --> 00:07:17,816
ALL RIGHT. THIS I GOTTA
SEE, CLIFFIE.

110
00:07:17,816 --> 00:07:20,392
YEAH, MAYBE WE COULD
STICK AROUND
AND MEET YOUR
LADY FRIEND.

111
00:07:20,392 --> 00:07:24,956
YOU KNOW, I, UH...
GUESS I...
I REALLY DON'T THINK
THAT'S A VERY GOOD IDEA.

112
00:07:24,956 --> 00:07:27,525
WELL, WHY DON'T YOU
BRING HER BY THE BAR
OR SOMETHING?

113
00:07:27,525 --> 00:07:29,828
I'VE BEEN TRYING
TO GET THE WOMAN
TO GO OUT, NORMIE,

114
00:07:29,828 --> 00:07:33,998
BUT SHE JUST WANTS
TO STAY HOLED UP HERE
IN HER LITTLE HIDEAWAY.

115
00:07:33,998 --> 00:07:37,743
I GUESS I'M HER
LOVE HOSTAGE.

116
00:07:39,138 --> 00:07:42,599
THAT'S SOMETHING
I DEFINITELY
DON'T CARE TO SEE.

117
00:07:44,008 --> 00:07:46,444
GOOD TO SEE YOU,
GUYS.

118
00:07:50,214 --> 00:07:54,587
HEY, IF I'M NOT
DOWN TO THE BAR,
SEND OUT A MISSING
SWINGER'S REPORT.

119
00:08:22,213 --> 00:08:24,085
HI.

120
00:08:26,317 --> 00:08:29,303
HI, SALLY.
HI.
HI.

121
00:08:29,303 --> 00:08:31,956
GUESS WHAT?
I HAVE GREAT NEWS.

122
00:08:31,956 --> 00:08:35,843
I WAS NAMED
"EMPLOYEE
OF THE MONTH"
AT THE YARN BARN.

123
00:08:37,996 --> 00:08:39,898
WELL, I TIED.

124
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:45,403
THAT'S REALLY
GREAT NEWS, SALLY.
I'M REALLY HAPPY FOR YOU.

125
00:08:45,403 --> 00:08:49,674
SO I WAS THINKING
MAYBE TO CELEBRATE,
WE COULD GO OUT.

126
00:08:50,041 --> 00:08:52,727
I GOT A BETTER IDEA.

127
00:08:52,727 --> 00:08:55,446
WHY DON'T WE JUST STAY IN?

128
00:08:55,446 --> 00:08:58,082
OH, CLIFF,
WE'VE DONE THAT
EVERY NIGHT THIS WEEK.

129
00:08:58,082 --> 00:09:01,986
I WAS THINKING MAYBE
WE COULD GO TO THAT BAR
YOU'RE ALWAYS
TALKING ABOUT.

130
00:09:01,986 --> 00:09:04,579
ARE YOU KIDDING?
THAT DIVE?

131
00:09:04,579 --> 00:09:10,430
YOU KNOW, SALLY,
I SPEND ALL DAY
WALKING AROUND OUTSIDE,

132
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:14,382
AND AT THE END OF THE DAY,
I JUST LIKE TO COME BACK
TO MY OWN LITTLE
APARTMENT HERE

133
00:09:14,382 --> 00:09:18,086
AND JUST SORT OF RELAX
AND TAKE IT EASY AND, UH...

134
00:09:18,086 --> 00:09:21,260
GET MY TENSIONS RELIEVED,
IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

135
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:23,875
YES, I KNOW
WHAT YOU MEAN.

136
00:09:23,875 --> 00:09:25,919
I'LL GET THE LIGHTS, HUH?

137
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:28,412
FINE, I'LL JUST
GET COMFORTABLE.

138
00:09:29,381 --> 00:09:34,447
- AND I'LL MEET YOU
ON THE SOFA IN
ABOUT 5 SECONDS.
- ALL RIGHT.

139
00:09:37,055 --> 00:09:40,175
HAVE YOU GOT THE...
YOU KNOW?

140
00:09:40,175 --> 00:09:42,793
OH, YEAH.

141
00:09:47,131 --> 00:09:50,717
AND NOW, HERE IS
THE HOST OF JEOPARDY!,
ALEX TREBEK!

142
00:09:50,717 --> 00:09:53,271
THANK YOU, AND WELCOME
ONCE AGAIN TO OUR SHOW.

143
00:09:53,271 --> 00:09:56,093
WE'RE ARE DELIGHTED OF
COURSE TO WELCOME BACK
OUR RETURNING CHAMPION,

144
00:09:56,093 --> 00:09:58,142
THE LADY FROM
BOCA RATON, FLORIDA...

145
00:10:01,112 --> 00:10:04,835
UH-OH. HERE COMES
MADAM NICOTINE.

146
00:10:06,418 --> 00:10:09,894
I'VE JUST HAD
THE MOST DISGUSTING
MORNING IN MY LIFE.

147
00:10:09,894 --> 00:10:11,889
OOH. CAN'T WAIT
TO HEAR ABOUT IT.

148
00:10:11,889 --> 00:10:15,710
I JUST SPENT
THE LAST HOUR
AT A "NO SMOKING" CLINIC

149
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:20,118
LOOKING AT PICTURES
OF UGLY ASHTRAYS,
ROOMS FILLED WITH SMOKE,
PEOPLE COUGHING.

150
00:10:20,118 --> 00:10:22,736
AND THE WORST ONE
WAS A CIGARETTE

151
00:10:22,736 --> 00:10:25,831
SNUFFED OUT
IN THE YOKE OF
A FRIED EGG.

152
00:10:25,831 --> 00:10:28,122
AND THAT STOPPED YOU
FROM WANTING
A CIGARETTE, HUH?

153
00:10:28,122 --> 00:10:30,491
NO, BUT I THINK IT'S PUT
ME OFF EGGS FOR GOOD.

154
00:10:30,491 --> 00:10:33,411
I'LL BE IN THE OFFICE
CHEWING ON MY HAIR.

155
00:10:33,411 --> 00:10:36,182
THIS IS
GONNA BE FUN.
CARLA, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

156
00:10:36,182 --> 00:10:39,801
I AM GOING TO
TORMENT HER
WITH THIS FRESH PACK
OF CIGARETTES.

157
00:10:39,801 --> 00:10:41,335
NO, CARLA, YOU MUSTN'T!

158
00:10:41,335 --> 00:10:44,823
CARLA, NOW GRANTED
SHE'S BEEN IN A RATHER
A FOUL MOOD LATELY,

159
00:10:44,823 --> 00:10:47,266
BUT REBECCA HAS MADE
A SERIOUS LIFE DECISION.

160
00:10:47,266 --> 00:10:51,230
AND WHAT SHE NEEDS NOW
MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE
IS ENCOURAGEMENT
AND SUPPORT.

161
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:53,686
AND I, FOR ONE,
AM NOT GOING TO FAIL HER.

162
00:10:53,832 --> 00:10:56,785
- OH, REBECCA?
- WHAT IS IT, BONE-DOME?

163
00:10:56,785 --> 00:10:59,198
HERE, TRY THESE.
THEY'RE MENTHOLS.

164
00:11:01,139 --> 00:11:02,928
NEXT CASE.

165
00:11:04,743 --> 00:11:07,712
DR. CRANE...
I'M REALLY SORRY.

166
00:11:07,712 --> 00:11:09,664
I THINK I'M JUST
A LITTLE ON EDGE.

167
00:11:09,664 --> 00:11:12,483
LOOK, I APOLOGIZE, TOO.
I BEHAVED VERY
UNPROFESSIONALLY.

168
00:11:12,483 --> 00:11:16,154
IT'S JUST THAT
I'M REALLY FRUSTRATED
BECAUSE I CAN'T SEEM
TO KICK THIS HABIT.

169
00:11:16,154 --> 00:11:19,690
LISTEN, MAY I SUGGEST
SOMETHING
THAT HAS SEEMED TO WORK
FOR MANY OF MY PATIENTS?

170
00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:21,716
CHANGING DOCTORS?

171
00:11:24,262 --> 00:11:26,504
THANK YOU, CARLA, NO.

172
00:11:27,231 --> 00:11:31,152
YOU'RE ENGAGED RIGHT NOW
IN A PSYCHOLOGICAL
BATTLE WITH YOUR WILL.

173
00:11:31,152 --> 00:11:33,805
NOW YOU'VE GOT BRING
TO THE FOREGROUND
EVERY WEAPON AVAILABLE.

174
00:11:33,805 --> 00:11:37,842
PROMISE YOURSELF THAT IF
YOU SMOKE ONE MORE CIGARETTE,

175
00:11:37,842 --> 00:11:42,020
YOU'LL DO
THE MOST DISGUSTING,
REPULSIVE THING
YOU CAN IMAGINE.

176
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:44,898
DR. CRANE,
I CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE--

177
00:11:47,886 --> 00:11:49,738
SAM MALONE,

178
00:11:49,538 --> 00:11:53,806
IF I SMOKE
ANOTHER CIGARETTE,
I'LL GO TO BED
WITH YOU.

179
00:12:06,805 --> 00:12:09,676
DARN THING'S
ON THE BLINK AGAIN.

180
00:12:10,842 --> 00:12:13,536
EXCUSE ME, REBECCA.
WHAT?

181
00:12:13,536 --> 00:12:16,097
THERE'S A PROBLEM I'D LIKE
TO TALK OVER WITH YOU.

182
00:12:16,097 --> 00:12:18,208
I'M REALLY
TRYING TO QUIT!

183
00:12:18,208 --> 00:12:20,192
NO, NO, NO,
IT'S NOT ABOUT THAT.

184
00:12:21,752 --> 00:12:24,184
I MET THIS GIRL.

185
00:12:25,089 --> 00:12:27,240
AND...

186
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:30,328
OH. PEOPLE
USUALLY STOP ME
AT THAT POINT.

187
00:12:30,328 --> 00:12:35,243
ANYWAY,
NIGHT AFTER NIGHT,
I KEEP BEGGING HER TO
COME DOWN TO THE BAR
TO MEET THE GUYS,

188
00:12:35,243 --> 00:12:37,262
BUT SHE JUST WON'T COME.

189
00:12:37,262 --> 00:12:40,504
SHE JUST WANTS
TO STAY HOME
AND WATCH "JEOPARDY!"

190
00:12:40,504 --> 00:12:43,357
I THINK THAT MAYBE
SHE'S A LITTLE...

191
00:12:43,357 --> 00:12:45,309
A LITTLE BIT ASHAMED
ABOUT THE WAY SHE LOOKS.

192
00:12:45,309 --> 00:12:47,511
SHE'S AFRAID SHE MIGHT
EMBARRASS ME.

193
00:12:47,511 --> 00:12:51,182
SO, UH, YOU GOT ANY
SUGGESTIONS?
WHAT CAN I DO?

194
00:12:51,182 --> 00:12:52,781
LET ME SEE, HERE...
UM...

195
00:12:52,781 --> 00:12:55,686
OH! HAVE YOU EVER SEEN THOSE
BEAUTY MAGAZINE MAKEOVERS?

196
00:12:55,686 --> 00:12:57,246
OH, YEAH, YEAH.
SURE. SURE.

197
00:12:57,246 --> 00:12:59,607
WELL, THEN WHAT ARE
YOU BUGGING ME FOR?

198
00:12:59,607 --> 00:13:03,443
WAIT A MINUTE.
IF YOU EVER SEE ME
WITH A CIGARETTE
HANGING OUT OF MY MOUTH,
WILL YOU DO ME A FAVOR?

199
00:13:03,443 --> 00:13:05,800
WHAT'S THAT?
KILL SAM.

200
00:13:12,536 --> 00:13:17,358
DID YOU, UH...
DAB LIP GLOSS
ON YOUR EYELASHES

201
00:13:17,358 --> 00:13:20,985
SO THEY
"SPARKLE LIKE
THE NORTH STAR?"

202
00:13:20,985 --> 00:13:22,991
YES, CLIFF.

203
00:13:22,991 --> 00:13:26,296
I'M COMING OUT NOW.
OK.

204
00:13:26,296 --> 00:13:29,103
LISTEN, DON'T STAND
TOO CLOSE, OK?

205
00:13:29,103 --> 00:13:30,789
TRY ME FROM
A DISTANCE, FIRST.

206
00:13:30,789 --> 00:13:33,139
OK. ALL RIGHT,
I'M BACKING UP.

207
00:13:33,139 --> 00:13:35,679
ALL CLEAR!

208
00:13:43,034 --> 00:13:46,938
- WOW.
- GEE, THANKS, CLIFF.

209
00:13:48,506 --> 00:13:51,293
OH, ISN'T IT ABOUT TIME
FOR"JEOPARDY!?"

210
00:13:51,293 --> 00:13:52,977
HUH?

211
00:13:53,762 --> 00:13:55,762
"JEOPARDY!"

212
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:58,016
"JEOPARDY!"

213
00:14:03,688 --> 00:14:05,140
WHY DON'T WE GO OUT?

214
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:06,958
REALLY, CLIFF?
SURE.

215
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:10,652
GREAT. OK.
I'LL JUST GO DO A LITTLE
MORE BLENDING,

216
00:14:10,652 --> 00:14:12,516
AND THEN WE'LL GO.

217
00:14:13,965 --> 00:14:15,666
I'LL JUST, UH...

218
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:22,599
BE OUT HERE
ON THE FRONT PORCH
AND CATCH A LITTLE BREATH
OF FRESH AIR.

219
00:14:25,369 --> 00:14:28,060
I GOT A FOX!

220
00:14:47,615 --> 00:14:49,248
CARLA! CARLA! CARLA!
CARLA! CARLA!

221
00:14:49,248 --> 00:14:51,119
LADIES ROOM!
LADIES ROOM, PLEASE!

222
00:14:51,119 --> 00:14:53,802
I'M NOT FOLLOWING HER
IN THERE AGAIN, SAM.

223
00:14:53,802 --> 00:14:57,313
I'M ONE PUFF AWAY
FROM PARADISE.
COME ON, PLEASE.

224
00:14:57,313 --> 00:15:02,464
THERE IS ONLY SO MUCH
POLITE CONVERSATION
YOU CAN MAKE YELLING
OVER A STALL.

225
00:15:04,966 --> 00:15:08,086
CLIFF...
THIS ISN'T A DIVE.

226
00:15:08,086 --> 00:15:12,440
WELL, NO, BY A DIVE
I MEANT THAT, UH,
IT WAS BELOW
STREET LEVEL.

227
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:14,378
OH, RIGHT.

228
00:15:15,243 --> 00:15:18,279
LET ME INTRODUCE YOU
TO MY CRONIES.

229
00:15:18,279 --> 00:15:23,248
BUT I GOT TO
WARN YOU FIRST,
THEY CAN BE
A LITTLE BIT CRUDE,
ALL RIGHT?

230
00:15:23,384 --> 00:15:26,954
HEY, GUYS!
VA-VA-VA-VOOM, HUH?

231
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:30,758
HELLO.

232
00:15:30,758 --> 00:15:32,994
I THOUGHT WE MET ALL
OF CLIFF'S COUSINS.

233
00:15:32,994 --> 00:15:35,596
- OH, I'M NOT HIS COUSIN.
- SHE'S MY DATE.

234
00:15:35,596 --> 00:15:38,509
WOULD YOU LIKE
A LITTLE
SEAT HERE?
I'LL GET YOU
SOMETHING TO DRINK.

235
00:15:38,509 --> 00:15:40,334
NICE TO MEET YOU.
LIKEWISE.

236
00:15:40,334 --> 00:15:44,739
WELL, I'LL TELL YOU,
SHE'S WHAT GUYS BACK
DOWN ON THE FARM
WHERE I COME FROM

237
00:15:44,739 --> 00:15:46,826
WOULD CALL "ETHEREAL."

238
00:15:46,841 --> 00:15:51,412
WOODY...
WHERE EXACTLY
WAS THIS FARM?

239
00:15:54,148 --> 00:15:57,035
EH...A COUPLE
OF BEERS, WOOD MAN.

240
00:15:57,035 --> 00:16:00,034
YOU GOT SOMETHING
ON HER, DON'T YOU?

241
00:16:00,555 --> 00:16:03,191
YOU FOUND SOMETHING
INCRIMINATING IN HER MAIL.

242
00:16:03,191 --> 00:16:07,899
FOR GOD SAKE, CLIFF,
JUST ASK HER FOR MONEY.
DON'T BE VICIOUS.

243
00:16:08,162 --> 00:16:11,415
LOOK, IS IT SO HARD
FOR YOU PEOPLE,

244
00:16:11,415 --> 00:16:14,100
AND WHATEVER
YOU ARE, CARLA,
TO BELIEVE THAT, UH....

245
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:18,072
THIS BEAUTIFUL WOMAN
WOULD GO OUT WITH ME
ON HER OWN ACCORD?

246
00:16:18,072 --> 00:16:19,573
NO, OF COURSE NOT, CLIFF.

247
00:16:19,573 --> 00:16:22,443
I CAN THINK OF ANY
NUMBER OF REASONS
WHY A WOMAN MIGHT
BEHAVE THAT WAY.

248
00:16:22,443 --> 00:16:24,124
- YOU CAN?
- WELL, OF COURSE.

249
00:16:24,124 --> 00:16:26,947
BUT REMEMBER,
I'M A PSYCHIATRIST.

250
00:16:28,682 --> 00:16:30,618
SO, WH--WHERE'S SAMMY?

251
00:16:30,618 --> 00:16:35,223
I WANNA SHOW HIM ONE
GORGEOUS BOSTONIAN
THAT SLIPPED THROUGH
HIS NET.

252
00:16:35,223 --> 00:16:38,423
HE'S OVER THERE
HAULING HER IN.

253
00:16:38,423 --> 00:16:42,063
WHOA! WHOA!
SAMMY! HEY, HEY, HEY.

254
00:16:42,063 --> 00:16:43,865
HEY, SAMMY.

255
00:16:43,865 --> 00:16:46,516
WHOA, YOUNG FELLOW,
WHOA, BOY.

256
00:16:47,068 --> 00:16:48,902
DO YOU KNOW EACH OTHER?
OH, YEAH.

257
00:16:48,902 --> 00:16:51,041
CAN I HAVE A WORD
WITH YOU, SAMMY?

258
00:16:51,041 --> 00:16:52,679
SEE, SHE'S WITH ME.
OH, OH.

259
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:55,234
UH, EXCUSE US, SALLY?

260
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:59,138
- HEY, SHE'S ONE
VERY PRETTY LADY.
- THANK YOU, SAM.

261
00:16:59,138 --> 00:17:01,623
ANOTHER ONE
OF YOUR COUSINS?

262
00:17:02,416 --> 00:17:04,022
SHE'S MY DATE.

263
00:17:04,525 --> 00:17:06,513
REALLY?

264
00:17:06,661 --> 00:17:09,825
IS SHE, UM...?
WE THINK SO.

265
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:13,411
CONGRATULATIONS, MAN.

266
00:17:13,411 --> 00:17:15,630
LISTEN, SAMMY, ABOUT THAT
OVER THERE--

267
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:18,389
I'M SORRY.
I WANT TO APOLOGIZE IF
I WAS OUT OF LINE THERE,

268
00:17:18,389 --> 00:17:22,685
BUT THE TRUTH IS
YOU HAVE TO EXPECT
THAT KIND OF THING
HAPPENING FROM NOW ON.

269
00:17:23,371 --> 00:17:24,606
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

270
00:17:24,606 --> 00:17:27,742
WELL, SHE DEFINITELY
A MAJOR-LEAGUE LOOKER
THERE, CLIFF.

271
00:17:27,742 --> 00:17:29,978
I MEAN, GUYS ARE
GONNA BE HITTING
ON HERE ALL THE TIME.

272
00:17:29,978 --> 00:17:32,380
YOU DON'T HAVE TO
WORRY ABOUT THAT, SAMMY.

273
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:35,027
SALLY IS
A ONE-MAN WOMAN.

274
00:17:35,027 --> 00:17:37,807
YOU BETTER CHECK
YOUR ARITHMETIC THERE.

275
00:17:41,956 --> 00:17:43,284
HEY, SALLY.

276
00:17:43,284 --> 00:17:46,360
CLIFF, LOOK WHO'S HERE.
IT'S JEFF--
FROM 325.

277
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:50,298
HEY, I KNOW YOU.
YOU'RE THE GUY
WITH THE BINOCULARS.

278
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:57,305
UH, SALLY, I THINK
IT'S ABOUT TIME
WE VAMOOSE OUT OF HERE.

279
00:17:57,305 --> 00:17:58,973
"JEOPARDY!" IS
GONNA BE STARTING
IN A LITTLE WHILE.

280
00:17:58,973 --> 00:18:00,233
LET'S GO, SALLY.

281
00:18:00,233 --> 00:18:04,278
JEFF JUST GOT
A NEW PORSCHE TURBO,
AND HE WANTS TO
TAKE ME FOR A RIDE.

282
00:18:04,278 --> 00:18:06,580
YOU DON'T MIND, DO YOU?
WELL, UH--

283
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:08,416
WE'LL JUST BE GONE
A FEW MINUTES.

284
00:18:08,416 --> 00:18:12,615
- YOU DON'T MIND, DO YOU?
- OH, NO.
NO, I DON'T MIND.

285
00:18:12,615 --> 00:18:17,670
HA HA!
YEAH, IT'S FINE.
I DON'T CARE.

286
00:18:18,359 --> 00:18:20,460
I DON'T MIND AT ALL.

287
00:18:26,434 --> 00:18:28,436
BEER HERE, WOODY.

288
00:18:35,176 --> 00:18:39,914
EXCUSE ME.
EXCUSE ME.
WHAT WAS THAT LADY
DOING IN THERE?

289
00:18:40,515 --> 00:18:44,756
OH.
OH, NO, NO, NO.
NO, YOU DON'T
UNDERSTAND.

290
00:18:44,756 --> 00:18:47,756
WAIT A MINUTE.
WE HAVE THIS LITTLE
BET BETWEEN US.

291
00:18:47,756 --> 00:18:51,374
LET ME--
LET ME EXPLAIN.
SEE, I GET TO GO
TO BED WITH HER IF SHE--

292
00:19:00,201 --> 00:19:02,804
JAMIE, KELP IS
A CORRECT RESPONSE,

293
00:19:02,804 --> 00:19:05,206
BUT YOU FORGOT TO PHRASE THAT
IN THE FORM A QUESTION.

294
00:19:05,206 --> 00:19:06,681
BEER, SAM, PLEASE.

295
00:19:06,681 --> 00:19:09,108
ARE YOU OK, CLIFF?

296
00:19:09,745 --> 00:19:12,636
"JEOPARDY!" USED TO BE
OUR SHOW, NORMIE,

297
00:19:12,636 --> 00:19:15,780
IT'S JUST NOT THE SAME
WATCHING IT BY MYSELF.

298
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:19,053
I JUST DON'T KNOW IF
I CAN GO ON WITHOUT HER.

299
00:19:19,053 --> 00:19:21,907
SHE'S ONLY BEEN GONE
FOR 10 MINUTES.

300
00:19:23,625 --> 00:19:25,760
YEAH, I HAD TO MAKE HER
BEAUTIFUL, NORMIE.

301
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:28,963
I'VE CREATED A BEAUTIFUL
MONSTER. WHAT AM I GONNA DO?

302
00:19:28,963 --> 00:19:31,145
WHAT IS PARAGUAY?
WHAT IS PARAGUAY?

303
00:19:31,145 --> 00:19:34,118
YEAH! ALL RIGHT!

304
00:19:35,369 --> 00:19:37,775
WELL, THANKS A LOT,
NORMIE.

305
00:19:37,775 --> 00:19:39,473
WHAT IS NOTRE DAME?
...NOTRE DAME?

306
00:19:39,473 --> 00:19:41,333
OOH, YEAH!

307
00:19:42,844 --> 00:19:45,329
HEY, CARLA.

308
00:19:45,329 --> 00:19:48,116
DO YOU SMELL SMOKE?
COME HERE.

309
00:19:48,116 --> 00:19:52,472
OF COURSE I SMELL SMOKE,
YOU DINK.
IT'S A BAR.

310
00:19:52,472 --> 00:19:55,673
I ALSO SMELL BEER,
SWEAT, AND LOUSY TIPS.

311
00:19:55,673 --> 00:19:58,142
NO, NO, NO, NO.
NO.
SHE'S SMOKING IN THERE.

312
00:19:58,142 --> 00:20:00,570
I KNEW SHE COULDN'T
LAST THIS LONG.

313
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,969
HEY, WHERE'S THE POOL TABLE?

314
00:20:07,969 --> 00:20:09,830
WRONG ROOM.

315
00:20:18,229 --> 00:20:20,765
I KNEW IT, I KNEW IT,
I KNEW IT! HA!

316
00:20:20,765 --> 00:20:23,852
I'M GOING TO SAY I KNEW IT,
BUT I KNEW IT. I KNEW IT.

317
00:20:23,852 --> 00:20:25,269
NOW THIS WAS
YOUR IDEA, TOO.

318
00:20:25,269 --> 00:20:27,471
I DID NOT
COME UP WITH THIS.
THIS IS YOUR IDEA.

319
00:20:27,471 --> 00:20:29,760
WHAT A GREAT IDEA! OH!

320
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:34,395
WELL, WHAT DO YOU SAY?

321
00:20:34,395 --> 00:20:36,865
SHALL WE STRIP DOWN
TO OUR SMILES HERE

322
00:20:36,865 --> 00:20:40,666
AND SHOW THE COUCH HERE
A GOOD TIME?

323
00:20:40,969 --> 00:20:45,087
NO.
WE'LL GO TO MY PLACE.

324
00:20:45,087 --> 00:20:50,011
EXCUSE ME?
WHOA. YOU'RE REALLY GONNA
GO THROUGH WITH THIS,
AREN'T YOU?

325
00:20:50,011 --> 00:20:53,387
- YES, I AM.
BUT I WANT TO GET
ONE THING STRAIGHT.
- YEAH, YEAH.

326
00:20:53,387 --> 00:20:57,568
MY SMOKING
HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH SEXUAL FRUSTRATION
OVER YOU OR ANYONE ELSE.

327
00:20:57,568 --> 00:20:59,653
IT'S JUST
A STUPID HABIT.

328
00:20:59,653 --> 00:21:04,117
BUT I MADE A PACT.
SO NOW I'M GOING
TO SUFFER
THE CONSEQUENCES,

329
00:21:04,117 --> 00:21:08,462
NO MATTER HOW VILE OR
DISGUSTING THEY MAY BE.

330
00:21:08,462 --> 00:21:10,864
LET'S GO.

331
00:21:13,334 --> 00:21:16,241
YOU DON'T REALLY WANT
TO DO THIS, DO YOU?

332
00:21:16,762 --> 00:21:22,175
NO, IT'S ALL RIGHT.
I'LL JUST CLOSE MY EYES AND
IMAGINE SOMEONE APPEALING.

333
00:21:23,411 --> 00:21:26,467
BESIDES, I HAVE A FEELING
IT WON'T TAKE LONG.

334
00:21:30,484 --> 00:21:35,089
GEE WHIZ, IF YOU'RE
NOT GONNA GET IN THE
SPIRIT OF THIS,
THEN I JUST
DON'T WANT TO DO IT.

335
00:21:35,089 --> 00:21:37,591
NO, COME ON. COME ON.
A DEAL'S A DEAL.

336
00:21:37,591 --> 00:21:40,171
NO.
LOOK, I MADE A PACT.
I JUST WANT TO
GET IT OVER WITH.

337
00:21:40,171 --> 00:21:42,234
NO.
I DON'T WANT TO DO IT.

338
00:21:42,931 --> 00:21:44,994
YOU KNOW, I HAVE
SOME PRIDE.
I HAVE SOME DIGNITY.

339
00:21:45,064 --> 00:21:48,169
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.
YOU FIND SOMEONE ELSE
TO DO YOUR DIRTY WORK.

340
00:21:49,470 --> 00:21:51,272
THIS WILL TEACH YOU
TO MESS WITH SAM MALONE.

341
00:21:51,272 --> 00:21:55,748
- WHAT HAPPENED?
- SHE ASKED ME TO
GO TO BED WITH HER,
AND I SAID NO.

342
00:21:59,147 --> 00:22:04,368
OH, CLIFF!
I'VE NEVER DRIVEN SO FAST
IN MY WHOLE LIFE.

343
00:22:04,368 --> 00:22:06,153
I HAD THE BEST TIME.

344
00:22:06,153 --> 00:22:09,673
OH, GREAT, GREAT.
SO DID I.

345
00:22:09,673 --> 00:22:11,225
CLIFF, IS SOMETHING
THE MATTER?

346
00:22:11,225 --> 00:22:14,976
NO.
NOTHING'S THE MATTER.
WHAT COULD BE
THE MATTER?

347
00:22:14,976 --> 00:22:17,482
I'LL TELL YOU
WHAT'S THE MATTER,
LITTLE MISS PORSCHE.

348
00:22:17,482 --> 00:22:20,819
TRY TO DO A GIRL A FAVOR,
HELP HER BECOME
A LITTLE BIT MORE ATTRACTIVE,

349
00:22:20,819 --> 00:22:25,239
AND THE NEXT THING YOU KNOW,
SHE'S OUT THERE...
ATTRACTING PEOPLE.

350
00:22:25,239 --> 00:22:29,049
IS THAT WHAT'S
BOTHERING YOU?
THIS MAKEUP?

351
00:22:29,108 --> 00:22:31,129
IS THAT WHAT ALL
THIS IS ABOUT?

352
00:22:31,129 --> 00:22:35,438
WELL...
HEY, YOU GOTTA ADMIT
BEFORE YOU PUT IT ON,
YOU WERE A...

353
00:22:35,779 --> 00:22:39,003
A SWEET THING WHO, UH...

354
00:22:39,003 --> 00:22:42,958
MORE CONTENT TO SIT
BY A DEAR FRIEND'S SIDE
ON AN EVENING

355
00:22:42,958 --> 00:22:46,456
AND WATCH A ROUSING,
WHOLESOME GAME
OF "JEOPARDY!."

356
00:22:46,456 --> 00:22:51,333
SO ALL I HAVE TO DO
TO MAKE THINGS
RIGHT BETWEEN US

357
00:22:51,333 --> 00:22:56,970
IS TAKE OFF ALL THIS
SILLY MAKEUP
AND GO BACK TO BEING
THE WAY I WAS?

358
00:22:57,456 --> 00:23:00,107
YOU'D DO THAT FOR ME?

359
00:23:00,107 --> 00:23:02,384
NO WAY.

360
00:23:03,527 --> 00:23:05,980
I LIKE THE WAY
I LOOK IN MAKEUP.

361
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:09,500
WAIT TILL THEY GET
A LOAD OF ME AT THE YARN BARN.

362
00:23:12,236 --> 00:23:15,572
IT MAKES YOU LOOK...
LIKE A...

363
00:23:15,572 --> 00:23:17,598
COVER GIRL.

364
00:23:18,109 --> 00:23:20,467
I'M SORRY, CLIFF.

365
00:23:20,845 --> 00:23:23,637
THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE
STUCK WITH.

366
00:23:24,315 --> 00:23:28,027
YOU'RE JUST GOING TO HAVE
TO LEARN TO LIVE WITH IT.

367
00:23:28,786 --> 00:23:32,422
WELL...
I GUESS I'M...

368
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:37,479
BIG ENOUGH
OF A PERSON
NOT TO LET
YOUR APPEARANCE
GET IN THE WAY OF
OUR RELATIONSHIP.

369
00:23:37,828 --> 00:23:39,625
I'M GLAD.

370
00:23:39,625 --> 00:23:44,552
- BESIDES, APPEARANCES
DON'T MATTER AT ALL.
- OF COURSE THEY DON'T.

371
00:23:44,969 --> 00:23:49,733
LIKE, IT DOESN'T BOTHER ME
THAT YOU WEAR THOSE
FUNNY WHITE SOCKS.

372
00:23:49,941 --> 00:23:52,068
OF COURSE IT DOESN'T.

373
00:23:52,068 --> 00:23:56,230
OR THAT IT LOOKS AS IF
YOU TRIM YOUR MOUSTACHE
WITH A BUTTER KNIFE.

374
00:23:56,230 --> 00:23:57,556
ANOTHER FINE EXAMPLE.

375
00:23:57,556 --> 00:24:00,523
CLIFF, HAVE YOU EVER
CONSIDERED JOINING A GYM?

376
00:24:00,523 --> 00:24:03,962
HAVE YOU EVER CONSIDERED
WEARING FLATS?

377
00:24:04,656 --> 00:24:08,139
I CAN HELP YOU WITH
THAT SMOKING PROBLEM.

378
00:24:09,633 --> 00:24:29,140
