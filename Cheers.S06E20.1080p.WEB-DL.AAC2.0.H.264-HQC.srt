1
00:00:01,824 --> 00:00:05,407
<i>Cheers is filmed
before a live studio audience.</i>

2
00:00:05,407 --> 00:00:07,779
Payday, payday.

3
00:00:07,814 --> 00:00:10,657
Sam, Carla, Woody.

4
00:00:10,657 --> 00:00:14,010
Oh, come to Papa, baby.
Boy, have I got plans for you.

5
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:15,805
Yeah, no kidding, Woody?
What are you going
to do with it?

6
00:00:15,805 --> 00:00:17,656
Put it in the bank.

7
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:20,267
Whoo, don't get arrested, buddy.

8
00:00:20,267 --> 00:00:23,425
Hey, Shoulder Pads, freeze.

9
00:00:24,931 --> 00:00:28,493
- Yes, Carla?
- I seem to be a little short.

10
00:00:28,493 --> 00:00:31,697
Yes, but you have
a warm personality.

11
00:00:31,697 --> 00:00:37,143
When you added up my paycheck,
I think you forgot to count
a couple of fingers and toes.

12
00:00:37,177 --> 00:00:41,570
Oh, I'm afraid I had to dock you
a total of two and
three quarters hours
for being late last week.

13
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:46,306
- I had good excuses.
- Three deaths in the
family since Monday?

14
00:00:46,306 --> 00:00:48,544
It's been a bad week.

15
00:00:48,544 --> 00:00:51,849
Carla, Carla, here's a little
time management trick that I use.

16
00:00:51,849 --> 00:00:54,293
I set my watch ahead
a half an hour.

17
00:00:54,327 --> 00:00:56,796
That way, when I think I'm
getting someplace on time,

18
00:00:56,830 --> 00:00:59,729
I'm actually fooling myself
into getting there early.

19
00:00:59,729 --> 00:01:02,381
Hey, you know, that makes
good business sense, boss.

20
00:01:02,381 --> 00:01:04,871
I guess if I set my watch
an hour ahead,

21
00:01:04,871 --> 00:01:07,205
- it'd be twice as good, huh?
- Right.

22
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:10,578
Hey, what do you know?
It's lunch time.

23
00:01:11,678 --> 00:01:14,344
No wonder I'm so hungry.

24
00:01:21,488 --> 00:01:23,788
¶ Making your way
in the world today ¶

25
00:01:23,823 --> 00:01:26,925
¶ Takes everything you've got.

26
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:29,561
¶ Taking a break
from all your worries ¶

27
00:01:29,595 --> 00:01:32,361
¶ Sure would help a lot.

28
00:01:32,966 --> 00:01:37,142
¶ Wouldn't you like
to get away? ¶

29
00:01:38,788 --> 00:01:40,940
¶ Sometimes you want to go.

30
00:01:40,974 --> 00:01:45,184
¶ Where everybody
knows your name ¶

31
00:01:46,179 --> 00:01:50,367
¶ And they're always glad
you came ¶

32
00:01:50,884 --> 00:01:53,485
¶ You want to be
where you can see ¶

33
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:56,021
¶ Our troubles
are all the same ¶

34
00:01:56,055 --> 00:02:00,803
¶ You want to be where
everybody knows your name ¶

35
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:03,913
¶ You want to go
where people know ¶

36
00:02:03,947 --> 00:02:06,374
¶ People are all the same.

37
00:02:06,374 --> 00:02:11,482
¶ You want to go where
everybody knows your name. ¶

38
00:02:27,686 --> 00:02:31,335
- What you reading, Cliffie?
- Oh, the, uh, Massachusetts
Scientific Journal.

39
00:02:31,335 --> 00:02:32,413
Yeah? Yeah.

40
00:02:32,413 --> 00:02:36,940
Yeah, you know,
this, uh, magazine
is sent to some
of the most prestigious
and high-minded intellectuals

41
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:38,864
in the greater
metropolitan area.

42
00:02:38,898 --> 00:02:40,884
How come you have it?

43
00:02:40,884 --> 00:02:45,303
Some guy on my route left town
and uh, didn't leave
a forwarding address.

44
00:02:46,222 --> 00:02:48,323
Oh, hey, Carla, looky here.

45
00:02:48,357 --> 00:02:51,354
It says the Britain Institute's
doing research on twins.

46
00:02:51,354 --> 00:02:54,946
Maybe you can get
your gruesome twosome
in there, eh?

47
00:02:54,980 --> 00:03:00,319
Yeah, right, like I got
nothing better to do
than schlep Little Elvis
and Jesse around.

48
00:03:00,353 --> 00:03:04,129
Especially so some pointy-heads
can plug electrodes
into their skulls

49
00:03:04,129 --> 00:03:06,558
to see what makes them slobber.

50
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:09,861
That's too bad;
They're offering,
uh, 50 bucks apiece.

51
00:03:09,896 --> 00:03:13,160
I always wondered
what makes them slobber.

52
00:03:14,033 --> 00:03:15,999
Sorry I'm late.

53
00:03:15,999 --> 00:03:20,007
- Where's Sam?
- He's upstairs having
lunch with Evan Dreck.

54
00:03:20,007 --> 00:03:22,958
Oh, God, Mr. Drake shows up
on a day that I'm late?

55
00:03:22,958 --> 00:03:26,675
Well, don't worry.
I've covered for you.
Told him you were drunk.

56
00:03:30,283 --> 00:03:34,902
What does this mean?
When did Evan
start taking Sam to lunch?

57
00:03:34,902 --> 00:03:37,606
When did the two of them
become good friends?

58
00:03:37,641 --> 00:03:40,010
When did I
start talking to myself?

59
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:44,095
Hey, maybe he's going to put Sam
in charge of the bar again.

60
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:46,398
What? Don't make me laugh.

61
00:03:46,433 --> 00:03:49,327
Sam, I'm serious
about that offer.
Now, I want to move you up.

62
00:03:49,327 --> 00:03:52,404
- What do you say?
- Oh, sounds tempting.

63
00:03:52,439 --> 00:03:56,968
When I see you behind that bar,
the more convinced I am
your talents are being wasted.

64
00:03:56,968 --> 00:04:00,816
Yeah, I know, I know,
but they won't let me
bring a bed in here.

65
00:04:01,515 --> 00:04:05,017
Yes, yes, boy,
thank you; Of course I will.

66
00:04:05,051 --> 00:04:07,019
I, uh, I'll get
the ball rolling.

67
00:04:07,053 --> 00:04:10,040
Hello, Mr. Drake.
It's so wonderful
to see you again.

68
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:12,355
Yeah, I'm going
to use your phone.

69
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:16,444
You scum-sucking, power-hungry,
backbiting creep.

70
00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:17,913
You stole my job.

71
00:04:17,947 --> 00:04:19,428
Ah, come on. That's not true.

72
00:04:19,428 --> 00:04:21,697
But I will bite your back
for you if you want.

73
00:04:21,697 --> 00:04:24,066
Oh, well, then,
what were you talking
to Evan about?

74
00:04:24,066 --> 00:04:27,072
He just offered me
an executive position
down at headquarters.

75
00:04:27,106 --> 00:04:30,727
You scum-sucking, power-hungry,
backbiting creep!

76
00:04:30,727 --> 00:04:33,123
Hi, Mr. Drake.
I was just congratulating Sam.

77
00:04:33,123 --> 00:04:34,879
Great.
Uh, it's all set, Sam.

78
00:04:34,914 --> 00:04:37,624
Hey, uh, listen.
Uh, I'm really
excited about this,

79
00:04:37,624 --> 00:04:39,292
but are you sure
that I'm qualified?

80
00:04:39,292 --> 00:04:41,636
I mean, you know, I never
even finished college.

81
00:04:41,636 --> 00:04:44,573
How far did you get?
- Halfway through the application.
I still have it here if you...

82
00:04:44,573 --> 00:04:46,791
Nah, that's okay.
You're qualified.

83
00:04:46,825 --> 00:04:49,132
- See you tomorrow.
- All right. Whoo.

84
00:04:49,314 --> 00:04:52,781
Something funny
is going on here.

85
00:04:52,815 --> 00:04:54,933
Why did he hire Sam?

86
00:04:54,967 --> 00:04:59,037
Why is he making him
an executive?
What's the matter with me?

87
00:04:59,071 --> 00:05:03,028
Well, for one thing, Miss Howe,
you talk to yourself
an awful lot.

88
00:05:22,992 --> 00:05:26,197
Mr. Malone, I hate to rush you,
but people are waiting.

89
00:05:26,232 --> 00:05:28,596
Have you made a decision yet?

90
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:31,552
Yes, Mimi, I have.

91
00:05:31,587 --> 00:05:34,827
I'll take the tuna on toast
with iced tea.

92
00:05:35,391 --> 00:05:36,842
Done.

93
00:05:36,876 --> 00:05:40,636
Oh, and, uh, after lunch,
we'll, uh, finish
the memo I was drafting.

94
00:05:40,636 --> 00:05:43,932
- Where did we leave off?
- "To whom it may concern."

95
00:05:43,966 --> 00:05:46,952
Boy, I like the way that sounds.

96
00:06:22,572 --> 00:06:25,281
Mr. Malone, some gentlemen
are here to see you

97
00:06:25,281 --> 00:06:28,853
from the firm
of Peterson, Clavin and Boyd.

98
00:06:29,696 --> 00:06:33,133
Peterson, Clavin and Boyd,
Peterson, Clavin and Boyd.

99
00:06:33,133 --> 00:06:38,024
Uh, Mimi, tell them
I'm in an important meeting
and can't see them, please.

100
00:06:41,592 --> 00:06:44,474
Hey, get in here, you mugs!

101
00:06:48,991 --> 00:06:52,530
Uh, Sam, don't be nice, now.
If you really have a meeting,
we don't want to bother you.

102
00:06:52,530 --> 00:06:55,060
No, no, oh, come on.
Get in here. Get in here.

103
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:59,491
Well, major corporate digs,
buddy, eh?

104
00:06:59,525 --> 00:07:01,893
Talk about your office
in the sky.

105
00:07:01,893 --> 00:07:05,782
Hey, oh, hey, lookit down here.
There's a guy washing windows.

106
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:09,843
That's one job
you wouldn't catch me doing
for all the bridges
in Bridgeport.

107
00:07:09,843 --> 00:07:13,775
Standing on a platform there,
suspended hundreds of feet
over certain death.

108
00:07:13,775 --> 00:07:17,553
- You said it.
- Hey, let's throw something
at him and scare him, eh?

109
00:07:18,177 --> 00:07:21,545
Hey, you know,
actually, uh,
these, uh, windows don't open.

110
00:07:21,545 --> 00:07:25,000
You're in a what's called
a climate-controlled office.

111
00:07:25,885 --> 00:07:27,916
Very impressed, Sam, eh?

112
00:07:27,916 --> 00:07:32,345
Oh, hey, Sammy, you
do look every inch
the corporate
muckety-muck there,
doesn't he?

113
00:07:32,345 --> 00:07:34,626
Well, you know,
I don't want to brag.

114
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:37,697
Mimi, get in here
and brag for me, will you?

115
00:07:38,297 --> 00:07:39,698
Just kidding, Mimi.

116
00:07:39,698 --> 00:07:42,687
While I have you,
Mr. Drake is on his way over.

117
00:07:42,687 --> 00:07:45,071
Oh, guys,
I'm sorry, men, uh...

118
00:07:46,238 --> 00:07:47,904
- Oh, yeah, sure.
- That's okay. That's all right.

119
00:07:47,966 --> 00:07:50,514
Uh, we're running late
for our next appointment
anyway, boys.

120
00:07:50,514 --> 00:07:52,067
Where is that?

121
00:07:52,067 --> 00:07:54,162
It's at the bottom
of the lobby escalator

122
00:07:54,196 --> 00:07:57,266
watching the secretaries
go up to the lunchroom.

123
00:07:57,433 --> 00:08:02,483
All aboard for the
Underalls Express,
now leaving Track 29.

124
00:08:04,456 --> 00:08:06,441
You mugs!

125
00:08:20,489 --> 00:08:23,958
- Ah, Sam.
- Oh, hey, Evan.

126
00:08:23,993 --> 00:08:26,882
I'm sorry.
I was engrossed in my work here.

127
00:08:27,964 --> 00:08:30,816
Just came to check on you.
How you doing?

128
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:33,353
Looks like you're making
yourself at home here.

129
00:08:33,353 --> 00:08:36,705
Desk. Supplies, huh?

130
00:08:36,739 --> 00:08:39,668
And the requisite
picture of your, uh...

131
00:08:39,838 --> 00:08:41,712
self.

132
00:08:42,807 --> 00:08:46,671
It's not really a great one,
but it's the only big one I had.

133
00:08:46,671 --> 00:08:47,966
Yeah, well...

134
00:08:47,966 --> 00:08:51,620
- You're all set then, huh?
- Yeah, oh, yeah.
Full steam ahead.
Take no prisoners.

135
00:08:51,654 --> 00:08:53,821
- Excellent. All right.
- You know, I, uh...

136
00:08:53,856 --> 00:08:56,908
- I do have, uh,
one little question, though.
- Shoot.

137
00:08:56,942 --> 00:09:00,069
<i>W-What do I do?</i>

138
00:09:00,579 --> 00:09:04,693
Ah, yes,
well, now, yours being
a newly created position,

139
00:09:04,693 --> 00:09:07,809
your responsibilities as
yet are not clearly defined.

140
00:09:07,809 --> 00:09:09,302
Well, uh, that helps,
that helps.

141
00:09:09,302 --> 00:09:10,852
But we're looking
for your input.

142
00:09:10,873 --> 00:09:12,194
Input... got you;
All right, input.

143
00:09:12,224 --> 00:09:14,976
Yeah, well, listen,
I'm going to be late for lunch,

144
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:17,145
so, uh, we'll talk later
at softball practice, huh?

145
00:09:17,179 --> 00:09:19,172
Oh, hey, you got
a softball team, huh?

146
00:09:19,172 --> 00:09:23,468
Oh, yeah, all the
corporations do.
It's a lot of fun, very casual.
Wear cleats.

147
00:09:23,503 --> 00:09:26,481
Hey, I'll have lots of input
for you then, sir.

148
00:09:27,006 --> 00:09:29,821
Okay, all right.

149
00:09:30,743 --> 00:09:33,545
Input, input.

150
00:09:33,579 --> 00:09:36,365
Let's see, here.

151
00:10:10,266 --> 00:10:13,102
Mimi, call Maintenance.

152
00:10:20,839 --> 00:10:25,363
Ridiculous.
Stupid Sam.

153
00:10:25,398 --> 00:10:28,130
Executive?

154
00:10:29,589 --> 00:10:31,669
I'm sorry. Are
you talking to me?

155
00:10:31,703 --> 00:10:33,788
No, I was talking to my...

156
00:10:34,657 --> 00:10:37,008
Yes, I was.

157
00:10:37,042 --> 00:10:40,262
So, you say that they did
make Sam an executive?

158
00:10:40,296 --> 00:10:41,898
- Oh, yeah, absolutely.
- Yeah. Yeah.

159
00:10:41,898 --> 00:10:45,667
Giving him the red carpet
treatment over there.
He's a regular Armand Hammer.

160
00:10:45,701 --> 00:10:50,009
Oh, that reminds me.
I got to change the baking soda
in my refrigerator.

161
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:53,569
Hi, everybody.

162
00:10:53,569 --> 00:10:57,592
I just got back
from twin testing,
and I would like to announce

163
00:10:57,592 --> 00:11:02,389
that I now like science
100 bucks more than I used to.

164
00:11:02,389 --> 00:11:03,522
Hey, all right.

165
00:11:03,522 --> 00:11:07,038
I found out that Little Elvis
is a lot more aggressive

166
00:11:07,072 --> 00:11:09,240
in certain situations
than Jesse.

167
00:11:09,274 --> 00:11:11,347
Or is it vice versa?

168
00:11:11,347 --> 00:11:13,211
Ah, who cares?

169
00:11:13,245 --> 00:11:15,507
Not these twins.

170
00:11:20,269 --> 00:11:22,913
People, I have an announcement!

171
00:11:22,913 --> 00:11:26,841
Mr. Sam Malone,
the newest member
of the corporate softball team,

172
00:11:26,841 --> 00:11:30,645
just pitched a shutout
against General Electric!

173
00:11:33,215 --> 00:11:37,330
I'd say I loved
pinning back the ears
of a Fortune 500 company.

174
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:39,917
Kind of makes you feel proud
to be part of the corporation,
doesn't it?

175
00:11:39,917 --> 00:11:41,343
Rah-rah-rah.

176
00:11:41,343 --> 00:11:43,991
Hey, you know, I never knew
that you were a cheerleader.

177
00:11:44,026 --> 00:11:47,145
Although I have always admired
your pom-poms.

178
00:11:48,531 --> 00:11:51,885
Sam, uh, why does your jersey
say "Heppel" on the back?

179
00:11:51,885 --> 00:11:54,015
Oh, that was some guy
who used to work
for the company.

180
00:11:54,036 --> 00:11:55,834
They haven't had time
to order mine yet.

181
00:11:55,834 --> 00:11:59,407
- Supply problems.
- "Supply problems."

182
00:11:59,442 --> 00:12:02,009
Yes, that happens a lot
in large corporations.

183
00:12:02,044 --> 00:12:05,794
You know, Sam, they
were really lucky
to get you on the team.

184
00:12:05,794 --> 00:12:07,514
You want to know how lucky?

185
00:12:07,514 --> 00:12:11,786
They just made the playoffs
the day before they hired me.

186
00:12:12,488 --> 00:12:15,990
Oh, my...!
I finally figured it out.

187
00:12:16,024 --> 00:12:18,760
Life makes sense,
and I am not crazy.

188
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:21,676
Well, that's only
a layman's opinion.

189
00:12:22,432 --> 00:12:24,541
Sam is a ringer.

190
00:12:24,541 --> 00:12:27,984
Evan just hired him
to win the championship.

191
00:12:27,984 --> 00:12:29,699
In two weeks, he'll
be out of there.

192
00:12:29,699 --> 00:12:32,106
Now, Rebecca,
you can't tell him that.

193
00:12:32,141 --> 00:12:34,981
At least let the man enjoy
his day in the sun.

194
00:12:37,345 --> 00:12:41,566
All right.
Sam has taken enough
hard knocks this year.

195
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,826
No, it's pleasure enough
for me to just know.

196
00:12:44,826 --> 00:12:46,468
I won't break his heart.

197
00:12:46,468 --> 00:12:49,858
Oh, hey, uh, Rebecca,
the guys decided

198
00:12:49,892 --> 00:12:53,129
that you could be
our cheerleader
on one condition.

199
00:12:53,129 --> 00:12:55,144
Lose the bra.

200
00:12:59,584 --> 00:13:01,920
I won't break his heart.

201
00:13:01,954 --> 00:13:05,417
I will rip it from his chest.

202
00:13:27,478 --> 00:13:30,353
Here are those
copies of your report,
Mr. Malone.

203
00:13:30,353 --> 00:13:34,183
Oh, great.
You got colored paper.

204
00:13:35,403 --> 00:13:38,722
Hey, hey.
Look at that.

205
00:13:38,756 --> 00:13:40,561
Lots of input.

206
00:13:40,561 --> 00:13:42,359
Am I interrupting anything?

207
00:13:42,393 --> 00:13:44,311
Oh, hey, Rebecca.
No, come on in.

208
00:13:44,311 --> 00:13:46,335
Thank you, Mimi.

209
00:13:46,335 --> 00:13:51,375
Well, Rebecca...
welcome to the, uh,
executive office.

210
00:13:51,473 --> 00:13:54,587
Would you like to have a seat
in the executive chair there?

211
00:13:54,587 --> 00:13:56,666
Or maybe on the executive sofa?

212
00:13:56,666 --> 00:13:59,331
Or how 'bout the executive lap?

213
00:14:06,501 --> 00:14:10,904
No, but, uh, seriously,
uh, what-what brings you
down to corporate?

214
00:14:10,939 --> 00:14:13,473
Oh, I have a little information
about your promotion

215
00:14:13,473 --> 00:14:16,009
that I'm going to really
enjoy sharing with you.

216
00:14:16,043 --> 00:14:19,597
Oh, yeah. Listen.
Before you do, there's something
I want to talk
to you about, too.

217
00:14:19,631 --> 00:14:21,664
Uh, sit down, please, sit down.

218
00:14:23,619 --> 00:14:27,517
I just want to say
tha-that I'm sorry, you know,

219
00:14:27,517 --> 00:14:30,240
for teasing you the way I did
and everything.

220
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,460
I know we both
had a lot of fun with it,
but I-it wasn't right.

221
00:14:33,494 --> 00:14:36,213
- That's okay. I just wanted...
- No, no, no.

222
00:14:36,247 --> 00:14:39,718
See, it, it wasn't okay.
I mean, absolutely not.

223
00:14:39,718 --> 00:14:44,588
I think I was just
trying to, you know,
show off in front of the guys.

224
00:14:44,622 --> 00:14:48,776
Truth is...
this is all kind of new to me.

225
00:14:48,811 --> 00:14:51,025
I keep expecting somebody to
come through the door and say,

226
00:14:51,025 --> 00:14:54,696
"Malone, job's over.
You're through.
"Get out of here,"
and it's a big joke.

227
00:14:54,696 --> 00:14:58,018
- Good. Is it my turn now?
- No, in a second, in a second.

228
00:14:58,053 --> 00:14:59,781
You know, the, uh...

229
00:14:59,781 --> 00:15:04,560
first thing that I did...
when I was alone
in the office here...

230
00:15:04,622 --> 00:15:07,194
I, uh, called my father,

231
00:15:07,228 --> 00:15:10,366
who I hadn't talked to
for over three years.

232
00:15:10,366 --> 00:15:12,833
And when I told him
where I was sitting,

233
00:15:12,835 --> 00:15:14,622
you know,
what I was looking out at,

234
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:18,117
and, uh, what,
what my title is...

235
00:15:18,117 --> 00:15:21,997
for the first time ever,

236
00:15:21,997 --> 00:15:25,645
he told me
how proud he was of me.

237
00:15:26,648 --> 00:15:28,396
Anyway. Whoa!

238
00:15:28,396 --> 00:15:31,414
Uh, what-what are you
dying to tell me here?

239
00:15:33,588 --> 00:15:36,783
Just that we
are darn proud of you, too.

240
00:15:36,783 --> 00:15:39,293
Oh, thank you!
God, that's great. Thank you.

241
00:15:39,328 --> 00:15:40,628
Hey, hey, get a load of this.

242
00:15:40,662 --> 00:15:43,247
My folks, uh...
their wedding anniversary
is next month.

243
00:15:43,281 --> 00:15:46,316
I'm gonna fly them in here,
and I'm gonna give them
the grand tour.

244
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:47,844
I just can't wait to
see their faces.

245
00:15:47,844 --> 00:15:49,953
- Stop.
- What?

246
00:15:49,953 --> 00:15:54,724
Sam... I didn't want
to have to tell you this,
but now I have to.

247
00:15:54,759 --> 00:15:57,396
All right, all right,
What do you got?

248
00:15:57,396 --> 00:16:00,165
No,
I actually did want
to have to tell you this,
but I wanted to enjoy it,

249
00:16:00,165 --> 00:16:02,711
and now you've ruined that,
and I have to tell you anyway.

250
00:16:04,502 --> 00:16:08,728
- You're not gonna
be here next month.
- What do you mean?

251
00:16:09,057 --> 00:16:11,377
Malone, you're a ringer.

252
00:16:11,377 --> 00:16:14,263
Ooh, I did like
doing it a little bit.

253
00:16:15,355 --> 00:16:17,380
Wh-What do you mean, ringer?

254
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:20,977
I mean that Evan just hired you
to win the championship.

255
00:16:20,977 --> 00:16:23,844
And when that's over,
you're history.

256
00:16:24,172 --> 00:16:28,575
Oh, boy.
I should have expected this.

257
00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:31,578
Sam, it's just the way
of the business world.

258
00:16:31,613 --> 00:16:35,940
No, no, no, no.
I mean, that you are jealous.
How petty of you.

259
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:39,464
I can't believe this.
You know, the fact
that I played baseball

260
00:16:39,464 --> 00:16:41,520
has nothing to do with this job.

261
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:43,390
I am a good executive.

262
00:16:43,424 --> 00:16:45,526
And, you know,
you are way off base,
and I'm gonna prove it to you.

263
00:16:45,526 --> 00:16:48,636
Mimi, get-get Mr. Drake
on the phone right away.

264
00:16:48,636 --> 00:16:50,130
Right away, Mr. Malone.

265
00:16:50,164 --> 00:16:51,649
Sam, you don't have to do this.

266
00:16:51,683 --> 00:16:54,479
You know, I was hired
for a lot of reasons.

267
00:16:54,479 --> 00:16:57,828
- Like what?
- Yeah, I'll tell you,
"like what,"
like this report, for example.

268
00:16:57,828 --> 00:17:00,174
This sucker is loaded
with input.

269
00:17:00,208 --> 00:17:05,741
Sam, as one friend to another,
I really am just trying
to do you a favor.

270
00:17:06,331 --> 00:17:08,812
Mr. Drake is still
in a sales meeting.

271
00:17:08,812 --> 00:17:10,668
What do you mean,
a sales meeting?

272
00:17:10,702 --> 00:17:13,002
Why aren't I there?
I-I'm the Eastern...

273
00:17:13,070 --> 00:17:16,040
the Western...
I-I'm the Southwest...

274
00:17:16,074 --> 00:17:19,436
I'm the "Eastern Regional
Sales Manager."

275
00:17:19,561 --> 00:17:23,828
I don't know,
but he said to rest up your arm
because you're starting tonight.

276
00:17:26,684 --> 00:17:29,762
Well, there's just probably
some mix-up.

277
00:17:29,762 --> 00:17:32,118
You know, maybe I missed
a memo or something.

278
00:17:32,207 --> 00:17:35,953
I'm gonna go, uh, straighten
this out right now.

279
00:17:35,953 --> 00:17:39,137
Don't you have a job
to go to or something?

280
00:17:51,877 --> 00:17:54,733
Mimi, call Maintenance.

281
00:17:54,810 --> 00:17:57,629
All right, have your people
coordinate with Marketing.

282
00:17:57,629 --> 00:18:00,776
- We'll get this campaign
on the boards.
- Will do.

283
00:18:02,954 --> 00:18:04,254
Sorry I'm late.

284
00:18:04,254 --> 00:18:06,349
I guess that about wraps it up.

285
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:09,402
Uh, say, before you go,
I just want

286
00:18:09,485 --> 00:18:13,102
to say
that I'm really backed up
with paperwork,
and I won't be able
to make the game tonight.

287
00:18:13,102 --> 00:18:14,879
What? What?
Can't make the game?

288
00:18:14,879 --> 00:18:19,358
Hey, wait a minute, Evan.
I-I didn't give up my office
two weeks
to let this guy do paperwork.

289
00:18:19,358 --> 00:18:20,875
Easy, Heppel.

290
00:18:20,875 --> 00:18:22,604
Heppel?

291
00:18:23,075 --> 00:18:25,642
What? You're Heppel?

292
00:18:25,643 --> 00:18:28,755
But... I thought
that you were supposed...

293
00:18:30,182 --> 00:18:33,650
Oh, boy.
I-I am a ringer.

294
00:18:33,684 --> 00:18:36,098
That's right.
I'm right, aren't I,
that I'm a ringer?

295
00:18:36,098 --> 00:18:41,798
Well, I'll be straight
with you, Sam.
Sure, we originally hired you
to pitch for the
softball team,

296
00:18:41,798 --> 00:18:45,078
but, uh,
actually, you've turned out
to be somewhat of a surprise.

297
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:49,119
Yeah, yeah, you're a much better
hitter than we anticipated.

298
00:18:55,156 --> 00:18:58,294
Come on.
Man, this really bites it.

299
00:18:58,877 --> 00:19:01,444
I mean, here I thought
you wanted me for my mind,

300
00:19:01,479 --> 00:19:03,814
and it turns out
you just wanted me for my body.

301
00:19:03,848 --> 00:19:06,373
Where have I heard that before?

302
00:19:06,885 --> 00:19:10,666
Is it really that bad, Sam?
I mean, you make good money.

303
00:19:10,666 --> 00:19:12,506
Everyone around here likes you.
What's the problem?

304
00:19:12,641 --> 00:19:17,343
The problem is that, you know,
as soon as
softball season's over,
I'm out of here.

305
00:19:17,378 --> 00:19:20,449
You don't have to be.
We'll find a place for you.

306
00:19:20,449 --> 00:19:23,093
I mean, uh,
softball season next year.

307
00:19:23,093 --> 00:19:26,606
No, no, no.
You know,
if I'm gonna stay here,

308
00:19:26,606 --> 00:19:28,451
I want it to be
for legitimate reasons.

309
00:19:28,451 --> 00:19:31,976
I mean, come on, Evan,
at least look at my report.

310
00:19:32,010 --> 00:19:35,145
Now, if you think
that I have what it takes,
you know, after looking at that,

311
00:19:35,179 --> 00:19:39,016
to be an executive right here,
right now, the way I am,
then, you know, then fine.

312
00:19:39,050 --> 00:19:42,054
But otherwise, I think
you know, we should just shake hands

313
00:19:42,054 --> 00:19:45,333
like gentlemen
and part company.

314
00:19:53,364 --> 00:19:57,100
Ho! Lock up your women!
Sammy's back.

315
00:19:57,758 --> 00:20:00,782
Sam, you know, I'm sorry
to hear about
the termination there, buddy.

316
00:20:00,782 --> 00:20:02,439
Yeah, tough luck, pal.

317
00:20:02,473 --> 00:20:05,058
Yeah. Hey, easy come, easy go.

318
00:20:05,092 --> 00:20:08,778
No, truth is, it was a shock,
but then I, uh...

319
00:20:08,813 --> 00:20:11,233
I went into
the executive washroom,

320
00:20:11,233 --> 00:20:13,951
and I splashed
some water on my face,
and I looked in the mirror,

321
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:15,643
and the mirror
looked back and said,

322
00:20:15,643 --> 00:20:20,301
"You're not an executive, man.
Get back to where you belong."

323
00:20:20,301 --> 00:20:21,197
Yeah. Smart there.

324
00:20:21,197 --> 00:20:24,624
I thought they only had mirrors
like that in the movies.

325
00:20:26,915 --> 00:20:29,133
It's good to be back.

326
00:20:29,167 --> 00:20:31,190
Oh, Miss Howe will sure be relieved.

327
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:34,088
She said that you'd be shattered
and we should all
be really nice to you.

328
00:20:34,088 --> 00:20:35,270
She did, huh? Mm-hmm.

329
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:40,079
Well... maybe I ought
to go set her mind at ease.

330
00:20:48,086 --> 00:20:50,010
Hi, Rebecca.

331
00:20:52,156 --> 00:20:53,990
How are you, Sam?

332
00:20:53,992 --> 00:20:57,077
Well, I'm kind of... shattered.

333
00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:01,096
I was afraid you might be.

334
00:21:01,096 --> 00:21:03,515
Do you mind
if I stand here
for just a little while?

335
00:21:03,515 --> 00:21:06,737
It's kind of hard for me
to go back out there
after what happened.

336
00:21:06,772 --> 00:21:08,805
I feel so humiliated.

337
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:12,267
You just take
as long as you need.

338
00:21:21,752 --> 00:21:24,383
Would you like to talk about it?

339
00:21:24,383 --> 00:21:27,389
You mean about how bad I feel?

340
00:21:27,389 --> 00:21:30,543
Yeah, you know,
sometimes that helps.

341
00:21:30,745 --> 00:21:33,554
Well, I feel pretty bad.

342
00:21:34,182 --> 00:21:37,869
So... bad.

343
00:21:37,869 --> 00:21:41,888
I know.
And I feel terrible
that I had to tell you.

344
00:21:41,922 --> 00:21:45,790
Oh, well there's no sense
in us both feeling so bad.

345
00:21:46,562 --> 00:21:50,472
I just hate to see you like this.
Oh... oh.

346
00:21:52,502 --> 00:21:55,820
Sometimes these things happen.

347
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:59,173
But you will always
have your job here.

348
00:21:59,207 --> 00:22:01,808
Oh, it's not just
losing the job.

349
00:22:01,842 --> 00:22:05,546
It's that I was, you know,
taken advantage of.

350
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:07,883
I know. I know.

351
00:22:07,883 --> 00:22:12,884
You know, that I was used,
that I was just,
you know, manipulated

352
00:22:12,884 --> 00:22:16,356
by somebody who just
cynically wanted to...

353
00:22:16,391 --> 00:22:18,529
get something from me.

354
00:22:20,561 --> 00:22:22,596
Malone, what are you doing?

355
00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:25,195
I-I'm feeling bad.

356
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:30,103
No, you are feeling pretty good.

357
00:22:30,137 --> 00:22:33,496
Okay, I admit it.
I'm not a sad guy.

358
00:22:33,496 --> 00:22:36,230
I'm a happy, horny guy.

359
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,915
You know... we need pity, too.

360
00:22:41,949 --> 00:22:43,983
Oh, God, you are choice, Malone.

361
00:22:44,018 --> 00:22:45,872
You are just really choice.

362
00:22:45,872 --> 00:22:48,322
You will do anything
for a roll in the hay.

363
00:22:48,356 --> 00:22:52,525
If you will play
on my sympathies,
then you will stoop to anything.

364
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:55,832
God, I am tired of fighting you.

365
00:22:55,832 --> 00:22:59,074
I just don't have
the strength to do it anymore.

366
00:22:59,074 --> 00:23:04,393
If this is what you really want,
then by all means.

367
00:23:04,608 --> 00:23:08,207
Take me here. Take me now.
Please, please.

368
00:23:10,295 --> 00:23:12,064
Are you serious?

369
00:23:12,064 --> 00:23:15,052
Oh, yes.
I want it bad.

370
00:23:19,456 --> 00:23:21,566
Well, all right.

371
00:23:32,566 --> 00:23:34,558
Is something wrong?

372
00:23:34,558 --> 00:23:38,521
Oh, nothing.
Oh, baby, oh, baby.

373
00:23:45,046 --> 00:23:48,081
Le-Let me get this straight.

374
00:23:48,116 --> 00:23:52,796
Is this what I can expect
in the way
of full participation?

375
00:23:54,338 --> 00:23:57,131
Until I get tired.

376
00:24:01,412 --> 00:24:04,097
Was it good for you?

377
00:24:06,078 --> 00:24:26,098
translate
