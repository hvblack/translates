1
00:00:01,824 --> 00:00:05,407
<i>Cheers is filmed
before a live studio audience.</i>

2
00:00:05,407 --> 00:00:07,779
Payday, payday.

3
00:00:07,814 --> 00:00:10,657
Sam, Carla, Woody.

4
00:00:10,657 --> 00:00:14,010
Oh, come to Papa, baby.
Boy, have I got plans for you.

5
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:15,805
Yeah, no kidding, Woody?
What are you going
to do with it?

6
00:00:15,805 --> 00:00:17,656
Put it in the bank.

7
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:20,267
Whoo, don't get arrested, buddy.

8
00:00:20,267 --> 00:00:23,425
Hey, Shoulder Pads, freeze.

9
00:00:24,931 --> 00:00:28,493
- Yes, Carla?
- I seem to be a little short.

10
00:00:28,493 --> 00:00:31,697
Yes, but you have
a warm personality.

11
00:00:31,697 --> 00:00:37,143
When you added up my paycheck,
I think you forgot to count
a couple of fingers and toes.

12
00:00:37,177 --> 00:00:41,570
Oh, I'm afraid I had to dock you
a total of two and
three quarters hours
for being late last week.

13
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:46,306
- I had good excuses.
- Three deaths in the
family since Monday?

14
00:00:46,306 --> 00:00:48,544
It's been a bad week.

15
00:00:48,544 --> 00:00:51,849
Carla, Carla, here's a little
time management trick that I use.

16
00:00:51,849 --> 00:00:54,293
I set my watch ahead
a half an hour.

17
00:00:54,327 --> 00:00:56,796
That way, when I think I'm
getting someplace on time,

18
00:00:56,830 --> 00:00:59,729
I'm actually fooling myself
into getting there early.

19
00:00:59,729 --> 00:01:02,381
Hey, you know, that makes
good business sense, boss.

20
00:01:02,381 --> 00:01:04,871
I guess if I set my watch
an hour ahead,

21
00:01:04,871 --> 00:01:07,205
- it'd be twice as good, huh?
- Right.

22
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:10,578
Hey, what do you know?
It's lunch time.

23
00:01:11,678 --> 00:01:14,344
No wonder I'm so hungry.

24
00:01:21,488 --> 00:01:23,788
¶ Making your way
in the world today ¶

25
00:01:23,823 --> 00:01:26,925
¶ Takes everything you've got.

26
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:29,561
¶ Taking a break
from all your worries ¶

27
00:01:29,595 --> 00:01:32,361
¶ Sure would help a lot.

28
00:01:32,966 --> 00:01:37,142
¶ Wouldn't you like
to get away? ¶

29
00:01:38,788 --> 00:01:40,940
¶ Sometimes you want to go.

30
00:01:40,974 --> 00:01:45,184
¶ Where everybody
knows your name ¶

31
00:01:46,179 --> 00:01:50,367
¶ And they're always glad
you came ¶

32
00:01:50,884 --> 00:01:53,485
¶ You want to be
where you can see ¶

33
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:56,021
¶ Our troubles
are all the same ¶

34
00:01:56,055 --> 00:02:00,803
¶ You want to be where
everybody knows your name ¶

35
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:03,913
¶ You want to go
where people know ¶

36
00:02:03,947 --> 00:02:06,374
¶ People are all the same.

37
00:02:06,374 --> 00:02:11,482
¶ You want to go where
everybody knows your name. ¶

38
00:02:27,686 --> 00:02:31,335
- What you reading, Cliffie?
- Oh, the, uh, Massachusetts
Scientific Journal.

39
00:02:31,335 --> 00:02:32,413
Yeah? Yeah.

40
00:02:32,413 --> 00:02:34,259
Yeah, you know,
this, uh, magazine

41
00:02:34,293 --> 00:02:36,027
is sent to some
of the most prestigious

42
00:02:36,062 --> 00:02:37,362
and high-minded intellectuals

43
00:02:37,396 --> 00:02:38,864
in the greater
metropolitan area.

44
00:02:38,898 --> 00:02:40,482
How come you have it?

45
00:02:40,516 --> 00:02:42,817
Some guy on my route left town

46
00:02:42,852 --> 00:02:46,188
and uh, didn't leave
a forwarding address.

47
00:02:46,222 --> 00:02:48,623
Oh, hey, Carla, looky here.

48
00:02:48,657 --> 00:02:51,243
It says the Britain Institute's
doing research on twins.

49
00:02:51,277 --> 00:02:52,444
Maybe you can get

50
00:02:52,478 --> 00:02:54,946
your gruesome twosome
in there, eh?

51
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:57,649
Yeah, right, like I got
nothing better to do

52
00:02:57,684 --> 00:03:00,319
than schlep Little Elvis
and Jesse around.

53
00:03:00,353 --> 00:03:02,187
Especially so some pointy-heads

54
00:03:02,221 --> 00:03:04,489
can plug electrodes
into their skulls

55
00:03:04,524 --> 00:03:06,558
to see what makes them slobber.

56
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:08,660
That's too bad;
They're offering,

57
00:03:08,695 --> 00:03:10,061
uh, 50 bucks apiece.

58
00:03:10,096 --> 00:03:13,999
I always wondered
what makes them slobber.

59
00:03:14,033 --> 00:03:15,801
Sorry I'm late.

60
00:03:15,835 --> 00:03:17,652
Where's Sam?

61
00:03:17,654 --> 00:03:19,734
He's upstairs having
lunch with Evan Dreck.

62
00:03:19,756 --> 00:03:22,340
Oh, God, Mr. Drake shows up
on a day that I'm late?

63
00:03:22,375 --> 00:03:24,509
Well, don't worry.
I've covered for you.

64
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:25,843
Told him you were drunk.

65
00:03:30,383 --> 00:03:31,816
What does this mean?

66
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:34,752
When did Evan
start taking Sam to lunch?

67
00:03:34,787 --> 00:03:38,006
When did the two of them
become good friends?

68
00:03:38,041 --> 00:03:40,576
When did I
start talking to myself?

69
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:42,444
Hey, maybe he's going to put Sam

70
00:03:42,478 --> 00:03:44,095
in charge of the bar again.

71
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:46,598
What? Don't make me laugh.

72
00:03:46,633 --> 00:03:48,600
Sam, I'm serious
about that offer.

73
00:03:48,635 --> 00:03:51,269
Now, I want to move you up.
What do you say?

74
00:03:51,303 --> 00:03:52,504
Oh, sounds tempting.

75
00:03:52,539 --> 00:03:54,006
When I see you behind that bar,

76
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:56,808
the more convinced I am
your talents are being wasted.

77
00:03:56,842 --> 00:03:57,809
Yeah, I know, I know,

78
00:03:57,843 --> 00:04:00,479
but they won't let me
bring a bed in here.

79
00:04:02,115 --> 00:04:03,382
Yes, yes, boy,

80
00:04:03,416 --> 00:04:05,017
thank you; Of course I will.

81
00:04:05,051 --> 00:04:07,219
I, uh, I'll get
the ball rolling.

82
00:04:07,253 --> 00:04:08,103
Hello, Mr. Drake.

83
00:04:08,137 --> 00:04:09,905
It's so wonderful
to see you again.

84
00:04:09,939 --> 00:04:11,819
Yeah, I'm going
to use your phone.

85
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:16,544
You scum-sucking, power-hungry,
backbiting creep.

86
00:04:16,579 --> 00:04:17,913
You stole my job.

87
00:04:17,947 --> 00:04:19,264
Ah, come on. That's not true.

88
00:04:19,298 --> 00:04:21,466
But I will bite your back
for you if you want.

89
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,035
Oh, well, then,
what were you talking

90
00:04:23,069 --> 00:04:24,369
to Evan about?

91
00:04:24,403 --> 00:04:25,537
He just offered me

92
00:04:25,572 --> 00:04:27,172
an executive position
down at headquarters.

93
00:04:27,206 --> 00:04:29,908
You scum-sucking, power-hungry,
backbiting creep!

94
00:04:29,943 --> 00:04:30,825
Hi, Mr. Drake.

95
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:32,540
I was just congratulating Sam.

96
00:04:32,545 --> 00:04:33,845
Great.

97
00:04:33,879 --> 00:04:34,879
Uh, it's all set, Sam.

98
00:04:34,914 --> 00:04:35,947
Hey, uh, listen.

99
00:04:35,981 --> 00:04:37,315
Uh, I'm really
excited about this,

100
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:38,816
but are you sure
that I'm qualified?

101
00:04:38,851 --> 00:04:40,818
I mean, you know, I never
even finished college.

102
00:04:40,853 --> 00:04:42,054
How far did you get?

103
00:04:42,088 --> 00:04:43,368
Halfway through the application.

104
00:04:43,389 --> 00:04:44,622
I still have it here if you...

105
00:04:44,657 --> 00:04:46,791
Nah, that's okay.
You're qualified.

106
00:04:46,825 --> 00:04:48,126
See you tomorrow.

107
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,494
All right. Whoo.

108
00:04:49,529 --> 00:04:53,031
Something funny
is going on here.

109
00:04:53,065 --> 00:04:55,133
Why did he hire Sam?

110
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:57,302
Why is he making him
an executive?

111
00:04:57,336 --> 00:04:59,037
What's the matter with me?

112
00:04:59,071 --> 00:05:00,605
Well, for one thing, Miss Howe,

113
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,441
you talk to yourself
an awful lot.

114
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:10,115
Hmm.

115
00:05:22,992 --> 00:05:24,672
Mr. Malone, I hate to rush you,

116
00:05:24,697 --> 00:05:26,197
but people are waiting.

117
00:05:26,232 --> 00:05:28,150
Have you made a decision yet?

118
00:05:28,184 --> 00:05:31,552
Yes, Mimi, I have.

119
00:05:31,587 --> 00:05:34,155
I'll take the tuna on toast
with iced tea.

120
00:05:35,591 --> 00:05:36,892
Done.

121
00:05:36,926 --> 00:05:38,459
Oh, and, uh, after lunch,

122
00:05:38,494 --> 00:05:41,429
we'll, uh, finish
the memo I was drafting.

123
00:05:41,463 --> 00:05:44,082
Where did we leave off?
"To whom it may concern."

124
00:05:44,116 --> 00:05:46,268
Boy, I like the way that sounds.

125
00:06:23,072 --> 00:06:26,808
Mr. Malone, some gentlemen
are here to see you

126
00:06:26,842 --> 00:06:29,861
from the firm
of Peterson, Clavin and Boyd.

127
00:06:29,896 --> 00:06:32,764
Peterson, Clavin and Boyd,
Peterson, Clavin and Boyd.

128
00:06:32,798 --> 00:06:35,433
Uh, Mimi, tell them
I'm in an important meeting

129
00:06:35,467 --> 00:06:37,085
and can't see them, please.

130
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,674
Hey, get in here, you mugs!

131
00:06:49,191 --> 00:06:50,992
Uh, Sam, don't be nice, now.

132
00:06:51,017 --> 00:06:52,050
If you really have a meeting,

133
00:06:52,084 --> 00:06:53,118
we don't want to bother you.

134
00:06:53,152 --> 00:06:54,319
No, no, oh, come on.

135
00:06:54,353 --> 00:06:55,820
Get in here. Get in here.

136
00:06:55,854 --> 00:06:59,491
Well, major corporate digs,
buddy, eh?

137
00:06:59,525 --> 00:07:01,459
Talk about your office
in the sky.

138
00:07:01,494 --> 00:07:03,294
Hey, oh, hey, lookit down here.

139
00:07:03,329 --> 00:07:05,063
There's a guy washing windows.

140
00:07:05,097 --> 00:07:06,364
Ooh.

141
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:08,066
That's one job
you wouldn't catch me doing

142
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:09,700
for all the bridges
in Bridgeport.

143
00:07:10,045 --> 00:07:11,846
Standing on a platform there,

144
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:13,672
suspended hundreds of feet
over certain death.

145
00:07:13,706 --> 00:07:14,906
You said it.

146
00:07:14,941 --> 00:07:18,062
Hey, let's throw something
at him and scare him, eh?

147
00:07:18,177 --> 00:07:19,343
Hey, you know,

148
00:07:19,378 --> 00:07:20,344
actually, uh,

149
00:07:20,379 --> 00:07:21,446
these, uh, windows don't open.

150
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,647
You're in a what's called

151
00:07:22,682 --> 00:07:24,362
a climate-controlled office.

152
00:07:25,885 --> 00:07:27,285
Very impressed, Sam, eh?

153
00:07:27,319 --> 00:07:29,554
Oh, hey, Sammy, you
do look every inch

154
00:07:29,589 --> 00:07:31,522
the corporate
muckety-muck there,

155
00:07:31,557 --> 00:07:32,791
doesn't he?

156
00:07:32,825 --> 00:07:34,626
Well, you know,
I don't want to brag.

157
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:36,861
Mimi, get in here
and brag for me, will you?

158
00:07:38,297 --> 00:07:39,564
Just kidding, Mimi.

159
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:42,100
While I have you,
Mr. Drake is on his way over.

160
00:07:42,134 --> 00:07:43,367
Oh, guys,

161
00:07:43,402 --> 00:07:44,469
I'm sorry, men, uh...

162
00:07:46,438 --> 00:07:47,305
Oh, yeah, sure.

163
00:07:47,339 --> 00:07:48,623
That's okay. That's all right.

164
00:07:48,657 --> 00:07:49,590
Uh, we're running late

165
00:07:49,625 --> 00:07:51,105
for our next appointment
anyway, boys.

166
00:07:51,127 --> 00:07:52,227
Where is that?

167
00:07:52,261 --> 00:07:54,162
It's at the bottom
of the lobby escalator

168
00:07:54,196 --> 00:07:56,464
watching the secretaries
go up to the lunchroom.

169
00:07:57,733 --> 00:08:00,335
All aboard for the
Underalls Express,

170
00:08:00,369 --> 00:08:01,903
now leaving Track 29.

171
00:08:03,772 --> 00:08:06,241
You mugs!

172
00:08:20,389 --> 00:08:21,556
Ah, Sam.

173
00:08:21,591 --> 00:08:23,958
Oh, hey, Evan.

174
00:08:23,993 --> 00:08:26,395
I'm sorry.
I was engrossed in my work here.

175
00:08:27,764 --> 00:08:29,731
Just came to check on you.

176
00:08:29,766 --> 00:08:30,866
How you doing?

177
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:34,636
Looks like you're making
yourself at home here.

178
00:08:34,670 --> 00:08:36,705
Desk. Supplies, huh?

179
00:08:36,739 --> 00:08:40,041
And the requisite
picture of your, uh...

180
00:08:40,075 --> 00:08:41,910
self.

181
00:08:41,944 --> 00:08:43,845
It's not really a great one,

182
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:46,114
but it's the only big one I had.

183
00:08:46,148 --> 00:08:47,382
Yeah, well...

184
00:08:47,417 --> 00:08:49,250
You're all set then, huh?
Yeah, oh, yeah.

185
00:08:49,285 --> 00:08:51,720
Full steam ahead.
Take no prisoners.

186
00:08:51,754 --> 00:08:52,603
Excellent. All right.

187
00:08:52,638 --> 00:08:53,921
You know, I, uh...

188
00:08:53,956 --> 00:08:55,740
I do have, uh,
one little question, though.

189
00:08:55,775 --> 00:08:57,008
Shoot.

190
00:08:57,042 --> 00:09:00,244
<i>W-What do I do?</i>

191
00:09:00,279 --> 00:09:01,480
Ah, yes,

192
00:09:01,514 --> 00:09:04,449
well, now, yours being
a newly created position,

193
00:09:04,484 --> 00:09:07,786
your responsibilities as
yet are not clearly defined.

194
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:09,538
Well, uh, that helps,
that helps.

195
00:09:09,572 --> 00:09:10,852
But we're looking
for your input.

196
00:09:10,873 --> 00:09:12,194
Input... got you;
All right, input.

197
00:09:12,224 --> 00:09:13,691
Yeah, well, listen,

198
00:09:13,726 --> 00:09:14,976
I'm going to be late for lunch,

199
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:17,445
so, uh, we'll talk later
at softball practice, huh?

200
00:09:17,479 --> 00:09:19,030
Oh, hey, you got
a softball team, huh?

201
00:09:19,064 --> 00:09:20,599
Oh, yeah, all the
corporations do.

202
00:09:20,633 --> 00:09:22,313
It's a lot of fun, very casual.

203
00:09:22,334 --> 00:09:23,468
Wear cleats.

204
00:09:23,503 --> 00:09:25,904
Hey, I'll have lots of input
for you then, sir.

205
00:09:27,206 --> 00:09:30,809
Okay, all right.

206
00:09:30,843 --> 00:09:33,545
Input, input.

207
00:09:33,579 --> 00:09:36,982
Let's see, here.

208
00:10:10,366 --> 00:10:12,600
Mimi, call Maintenance.

209
00:10:19,441 --> 00:10:23,094
Ridiculous.

210
00:10:23,129 --> 00:10:25,263
Stupid Sam.

211
00:10:25,298 --> 00:10:27,232
Executive?

212
00:10:29,068 --> 00:10:31,669
I'm sorry. Are
you talking to me?

213
00:10:31,703 --> 00:10:33,788
No, I was talking to my...

214
00:10:35,057 --> 00:10:37,158
Yes, I was.

215
00:10:37,192 --> 00:10:40,262
So, you say that they did
make Sam an executive?

216
00:10:40,296 --> 00:10:41,263
Oh, yeah, absolutely.

217
00:10:41,297 --> 00:10:42,364
Yeah. Yeah.

218
00:10:42,398 --> 00:10:44,366
Giving him the red carpet
treatment over there.

219
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,667
He's a regular Armand Hammer.

220
00:10:45,701 --> 00:10:47,068
Oh, that reminds me.

221
00:10:47,102 --> 00:10:49,538
I got to change the baking soda
in my refrigerator.

222
00:10:51,774 --> 00:10:53,107
Hi, everybody.

223
00:10:53,142 --> 00:10:55,443
I just got back
from twin testing,

224
00:10:55,478 --> 00:10:59,080
and I would like to announce
that I now like science

225
00:10:59,114 --> 00:11:02,417
100 bucks more than I used to.

226
00:11:02,451 --> 00:11:03,451
Hey, all right.

227
00:11:03,486 --> 00:11:05,369
I found out that Little Elvis

228
00:11:05,403 --> 00:11:07,038
is a lot more aggressive

229
00:11:07,072 --> 00:11:09,240
in certain situations
than Jesse.

230
00:11:09,274 --> 00:11:10,675
Or is it vice versa?

231
00:11:11,844 --> 00:11:13,211
Ah, who cares?

232
00:11:13,245 --> 00:11:14,813
Not these twins.

233
00:11:16,181 --> 00:11:17,949
Whoa.

234
00:11:20,269 --> 00:11:23,271
People, I have an announcement!

235
00:11:23,305 --> 00:11:25,407
Mr. Sam Malone,
the newest member

236
00:11:25,441 --> 00:11:27,409
of the corporate softball team,

237
00:11:27,443 --> 00:11:30,645
just pitched a shutout
against General Electric!

238
00:11:33,215 --> 00:11:35,082
I'd say I loved
pinning back the ears

239
00:11:35,117 --> 00:11:36,350
of a Fortune 500 company.

240
00:11:36,385 --> 00:11:37,786
Kind of makes you feel proud

241
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:39,987
to be part of the corporation,
doesn't it?

242
00:11:40,022 --> 00:11:41,289
Rah-rah-rah.

243
00:11:41,323 --> 00:11:42,590
Hey, you know, I never knew

244
00:11:42,625 --> 00:11:43,991
that you were a cheerleader.

245
00:11:44,026 --> 00:11:46,628
Although I have always admired
your pom-poms.

246
00:11:48,631 --> 00:11:50,197
Sam, uh, why does your jersey

247
00:11:50,232 --> 00:11:51,633
say "Heppel" on the back?

248
00:11:51,667 --> 00:11:52,700
Oh, that was some guy

249
00:11:52,735 --> 00:11:54,015
who used to work
for the company.

250
00:11:54,036 --> 00:11:56,370
They haven't had time
to order mine yet.

251
00:11:56,405 --> 00:11:57,572
Supply problems.

252
00:11:57,606 --> 00:11:59,407
"Supply problems." Yeah.

253
00:11:59,442 --> 00:12:02,009
Yes, that happens a lot
in large corporations.

254
00:12:02,044 --> 00:12:04,111
You know, Sam, they
were really lucky

255
00:12:04,146 --> 00:12:05,480
to get you on the team.

256
00:12:05,514 --> 00:12:07,482
You want to know how lucky?

257
00:12:07,516 --> 00:12:10,685
They just made the playoffs
the day before they hired me.

258
00:12:12,688 --> 00:12:13,955
Oh, my...!

259
00:12:13,989 --> 00:12:16,190
I finally figured it out.

260
00:12:16,224 --> 00:12:19,427
Life makes sense,
and I am not crazy.

261
00:12:19,462 --> 00:12:22,797
Well, that's only
a layman's opinion.

262
00:12:22,832 --> 00:12:23,931
Sam is a ringer.

263
00:12:23,966 --> 00:12:27,402
Evan just hired him
to win the championship.

264
00:12:27,436 --> 00:12:30,238
In two weeks, he'll
be out of there.

265
00:12:30,273 --> 00:12:32,106
Now, Rebecca,
you can't tell him that.

266
00:12:32,141 --> 00:12:33,508
At least let the man enjoy

267
00:12:33,542 --> 00:12:34,742
his day in the sun.

268
00:12:37,245 --> 00:12:38,129
All right.

269
00:12:38,164 --> 00:12:41,566
Sam has taken enough
hard knocks this year.

270
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:45,170
No, it's pleasure enough
for me to just know.

271
00:12:45,204 --> 00:12:47,238
I won't break his heart.

272
00:12:47,273 --> 00:12:48,572
Oh, hey, uh, Rebecca,

273
00:12:48,607 --> 00:12:49,858
the guys decided

274
00:12:49,892 --> 00:12:51,109
that you could be
our cheerleader

275
00:12:51,143 --> 00:12:52,410
on one condition.

276
00:12:53,312 --> 00:12:54,345
Lose the bra.

277
00:12:59,584 --> 00:13:01,920
I won't break his heart.

278
00:13:01,954 --> 00:13:04,889
I will rip it from his chest.

279
00:13:27,278 --> 00:13:28,428
Here are those

280
00:13:28,463 --> 00:13:30,064
copies of your report,
Mr. Malone.

281
00:13:30,098 --> 00:13:31,766
Oh, great.

282
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,567
You got colored paper.

283
00:13:33,601 --> 00:13:35,369
Oh.

284
00:13:35,403 --> 00:13:36,904
Hey, hey.

285
00:13:36,938 --> 00:13:38,772
Look at that.

286
00:13:38,806 --> 00:13:41,408
Lots of input.

287
00:13:41,442 --> 00:13:42,409
Am I interrupting anything?

288
00:13:42,443 --> 00:13:43,911
Oh, hey, Rebecca.
No, come on in.

289
00:13:43,945 --> 00:13:45,112
Thank you, Mimi.

290
00:13:46,748 --> 00:13:48,715
Well, Rebecca...

291
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:50,784
welcome to the, uh,
executive office.

292
00:13:50,818 --> 00:13:54,188
Would you like to have a seat
in the executive chair there?

293
00:13:54,222 --> 00:13:56,390
Or maybe on the executive sofa?

294
00:13:56,424 --> 00:13:58,592
Or how 'bout the executive lap?

295
00:14:06,501 --> 00:14:08,953
No, but, uh, seriously,

296
00:14:08,987 --> 00:14:10,954
uh, what-what brings you
down to corporate?

297
00:14:10,989 --> 00:14:12,339
Oh, I have a little information

298
00:14:12,374 --> 00:14:13,407
about your promotion

299
00:14:13,441 --> 00:14:16,009
that I'm going to really
enjoy sharing with you.

300
00:14:16,043 --> 00:14:17,277
Oh, yeah. Listen.

301
00:14:17,311 --> 00:14:18,412
Before you do, there's something

302
00:14:18,446 --> 00:14:19,747
I want to talk
to you about, too.

303
00:14:19,781 --> 00:14:21,448
Uh, sit down, please, sit down.

304
00:14:21,482 --> 00:14:23,884
Uh...

305
00:14:23,919 --> 00:14:25,452
I just want to say

306
00:14:25,486 --> 00:14:27,438
tha-that I'm sorry, you know,

307
00:14:27,472 --> 00:14:30,674
for teasing you the way I did
and everything.

308
00:14:30,708 --> 00:14:32,459
I know we both
had a lot of fun with it,

309
00:14:32,493 --> 00:14:33,460
but I-it wasn't right.

310
00:14:33,494 --> 00:14:35,078
That's okay. I just wanted...

311
00:14:35,113 --> 00:14:36,213
No, no, no.

312
00:14:36,247 --> 00:14:37,581
See, it, it wasn't okay.

313
00:14:37,616 --> 00:14:38,716
I mean, absolutely not.

314
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:40,183
I...

315
00:14:40,218 --> 00:14:42,586
I think I was just
trying to, you know,

316
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:44,588
show off in front of the guys.

317
00:14:44,622 --> 00:14:46,757
Truth is...

318
00:14:46,792 --> 00:14:49,026
this is all kind of new to me.

319
00:14:49,061 --> 00:14:51,562
I keep expecting somebody to
come through the door and say,

320
00:14:51,596 --> 00:14:53,097
"Malone, job's over.
You're through.

321
00:14:53,131 --> 00:14:54,799
"Get out of here,"
and it's a big joke.

322
00:14:54,833 --> 00:14:55,900
Good. Is it my turn now?

323
00:14:55,934 --> 00:14:58,018
No, in a second, in a second.

324
00:14:58,053 --> 00:14:59,419
You know, the, uh...

325
00:14:59,454 --> 00:15:01,421
first thing that I did...

326
00:15:01,456 --> 00:15:04,458
when I was alone
in the office here...

327
00:15:04,492 --> 00:15:07,194
I, uh, called my father,

328
00:15:07,228 --> 00:15:09,079
who I hadn't talked to

329
00:15:09,114 --> 00:15:10,297
for over three years.

330
00:15:10,332 --> 00:15:13,233
And when I told him
where I was sitting,

331
00:15:13,235 --> 00:15:15,519
you know,
what I was looking out at,

332
00:15:15,553 --> 00:15:17,954
and, uh, what,
what my title is...

333
00:15:17,989 --> 00:15:21,692
for the first time ever,

334
00:15:21,727 --> 00:15:25,062
he told me
how proud he was of me.

335
00:15:27,048 --> 00:15:28,065
Anyway. Whoa!

336
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:31,001
Uh, what-what are you
dying to tell me here?

337
00:15:33,588 --> 00:15:34,821
Just that we

338
00:15:34,856 --> 00:15:36,290
are darn proud of you, too.

339
00:15:36,325 --> 00:15:37,425
Oh, thank you!

340
00:15:37,459 --> 00:15:39,293
God, that's great. Thank you.

341
00:15:39,328 --> 00:15:40,728
Hey, hey, get a load of this.

342
00:15:40,762 --> 00:15:42,079
My folks, uh...

343
00:15:42,113 --> 00:15:43,547
their wedding anniversary
is next month.

344
00:15:43,581 --> 00:15:44,681
I'm gonna fly them in here,

345
00:15:44,716 --> 00:15:46,316
and I'm gonna give them
the grand tour.

346
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:48,552
I just can't wait to
see their faces. Stop.

347
00:15:48,586 --> 00:15:49,719
What?

348
00:15:49,754 --> 00:15:51,255
Sam... I didn't want

349
00:15:51,289 --> 00:15:54,724
to have to tell you this,
but now I have to.

350
00:15:54,759 --> 00:15:55,792
All right, all right,

351
00:15:55,827 --> 00:15:57,595
What do you got? No,
I actually did want

352
00:15:57,629 --> 00:15:59,763
to have to tell you this,
but I wanted to enjoy it,

353
00:15:59,797 --> 00:16:02,466
and now you've ruined that,
and I have to tell you anyway.

354
00:16:04,302 --> 00:16:07,405
You're not gonna
be here next month.

355
00:16:07,439 --> 00:16:09,023
What do you mean?

356
00:16:09,057 --> 00:16:10,624
Malone, you're a ringer.

357
00:16:10,658 --> 00:16:14,128
Ooh, I did like
doing it a little bit.

358
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:17,213
Wh-What do you mean, ringer?

359
00:16:17,248 --> 00:16:20,718
I mean that Evan just hired you
to win the championship.

360
00:16:20,752 --> 00:16:23,387
And when that's over,
you're history.

361
00:16:24,172 --> 00:16:26,673
Oh, boy.

362
00:16:26,707 --> 00:16:28,775
I should have expected this.

363
00:16:28,810 --> 00:16:31,928
Sam, it's just the way
of the business world.

364
00:16:31,963 --> 00:16:34,165
No, no, no, no.
I mean, that you are jealous.

365
00:16:34,199 --> 00:16:35,266
How petty of you.

366
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:36,901
I can't believe this.

367
00:16:36,935 --> 00:16:38,335
You know, the fact

368
00:16:38,369 --> 00:16:41,939
that I played baseball
has nothing to do with this job.

369
00:16:41,973 --> 00:16:43,440
I am a good executive.

370
00:16:43,474 --> 00:16:45,208
And, you know,
you are way off base,

371
00:16:45,242 --> 00:16:46,326
and I'm gonna prove it to you.

372
00:16:46,361 --> 00:16:48,345
Mimi, get-get Mr. Drake
on the phone right away.

373
00:16:48,379 --> 00:16:50,180
Right away, Mr. Malone.

374
00:16:50,214 --> 00:16:51,799
Sam, you don't have to do this.

375
00:16:51,833 --> 00:16:54,384
You know, I was hired
for a lot of reasons.

376
00:16:54,419 --> 00:16:55,686
Like what?

377
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:56,887
Yeah, I'll tell you,
"like what,"

378
00:16:56,922 --> 00:16:58,022
like this report, for example.

379
00:16:58,056 --> 00:17:00,524
This sucker is loaded
with input.

380
00:17:00,558 --> 00:17:02,526
Sam, as one friend to another,

381
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:05,329
I really am just trying
to do you a favor.

382
00:17:06,531 --> 00:17:08,699
Mr. Drake is still
in a sales meeting.

383
00:17:08,733 --> 00:17:10,668
What do you mean,
a sales meeting?

384
00:17:10,702 --> 00:17:11,968
Why aren't I there?

385
00:17:12,003 --> 00:17:14,104
I-I'm the Eastern...
the Western...

386
00:17:14,138 --> 00:17:16,090
I-I'm the Southwest...

387
00:17:16,124 --> 00:17:19,727
I'm the "Eastern Regional
Sales Manager."

388
00:17:19,761 --> 00:17:21,929
I don't know,
but he said to rest up your arm

389
00:17:21,963 --> 00:17:23,530
because you're starting tonight.

390
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,318
Well, there's just probably

391
00:17:28,353 --> 00:17:29,453
some mix-up.

392
00:17:29,487 --> 00:17:31,421
You know, maybe I missed
a memo or something.

393
00:17:31,456 --> 00:17:35,008
I'm gonna go, uh, straighten
this out right now.

394
00:17:36,177 --> 00:17:38,412
Don't you have a job
to go to or something?

395
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:54,728
Mimi, call Maintenance.

396
00:17:54,762 --> 00:17:56,013
All right, have your people

397
00:17:56,047 --> 00:17:57,281
coordinate with Marketing.

398
00:17:57,315 --> 00:17:59,116
We'll get this campaign
on the boards.

399
00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:00,251
Will do.

400
00:18:02,954 --> 00:18:04,554
Sorry I'm late.

401
00:18:04,589 --> 00:18:06,349
I guess that about wraps it up.

402
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:07,800
Uh, say, before you go,

403
00:18:07,825 --> 00:18:08,926
I just want to say

404
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,627
that I'm really backed up
with paperwork,

405
00:18:10,661 --> 00:18:12,529
and I won't be able
to make the game tonight.

406
00:18:12,563 --> 00:18:13,697
What? What?

407
00:18:13,731 --> 00:18:14,765
Can't make the game?

408
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:16,033
Hey, wait a minute, Evan.

409
00:18:16,067 --> 00:18:17,968
I-I didn't give up my office
two weeks

410
00:18:18,002 --> 00:18:19,569
to let this guy do paperwork.

411
00:18:19,604 --> 00:18:20,871
Easy, Heppel.

412
00:18:20,905 --> 00:18:23,340
Heppel?

413
00:18:23,375 --> 00:18:25,809
What? You're Heppel?

414
00:18:25,843 --> 00:18:28,178
But... I thought
that you were supposed...

415
00:18:30,382 --> 00:18:32,182
Oh, boy.

416
00:18:32,217 --> 00:18:33,650
I-I am a ringer.

417
00:18:33,684 --> 00:18:34,934
That's right.
I'm right, aren't I,

418
00:18:34,969 --> 00:18:36,002
that I'm a ringer?

419
00:18:36,037 --> 00:18:38,372
Well, I'll be straight
with you, Sam.

420
00:18:38,406 --> 00:18:40,440
Sure, we originally hired you

421
00:18:40,475 --> 00:18:42,426
to pitch for the
softball team, but, uh,

422
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:45,078
actually, you've turned out
to be somewhat of a surprise.

423
00:18:45,112 --> 00:18:46,346
Oh?

424
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:48,820
Yeah, yeah, you're a much better
hitter than we anticipated.

425
00:18:55,156 --> 00:18:56,172
Come on.

426
00:18:56,207 --> 00:18:57,741
Man, this really bites it.

427
00:18:59,077 --> 00:19:01,444
I mean, here I thought
you wanted me for my mind,

428
00:19:01,479 --> 00:19:03,814
and it turns out
you just wanted me for my body.

429
00:19:03,848 --> 00:19:05,382
Where have I heard that before?

430
00:19:07,285 --> 00:19:08,585
Is it really that bad, Sam?

431
00:19:08,619 --> 00:19:09,987
I mean, you make good money.

432
00:19:10,021 --> 00:19:11,554
Everyone around here likes you.

433
00:19:11,589 --> 00:19:12,656
What's the problem?

434
00:19:12,791 --> 00:19:14,340
The problem is that, you know,

435
00:19:14,375 --> 00:19:16,242
as soon as
softball season's over,

436
00:19:16,277 --> 00:19:17,443
I'm out of here.

437
00:19:17,478 --> 00:19:18,662
You don't have to be.

438
00:19:18,696 --> 00:19:20,364
We'll find a place for you.

439
00:19:20,398 --> 00:19:22,732
I mean, uh,
softball season next year.

440
00:19:22,767 --> 00:19:24,551
No, no, no.

441
00:19:24,585 --> 00:19:26,453
You know,
if I'm gonna stay here,

442
00:19:26,487 --> 00:19:28,889
I want it to be
for legitimate reasons.

443
00:19:28,924 --> 00:19:30,290
I mean, come on, Evan,

444
00:19:30,324 --> 00:19:32,026
at least look at my report.

445
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:34,161
Now, if you think
that I have what it takes,

446
00:19:34,195 --> 00:19:35,295
you know, after looking at that,

447
00:19:35,329 --> 00:19:37,497
to be an executive right here,
right now, the way I am,

448
00:19:37,531 --> 00:19:39,016
then, you know, then fine.

449
00:19:39,050 --> 00:19:40,416
But otherwise, I think

450
00:19:40,451 --> 00:19:42,085
you know, we should just

451
00:19:42,119 --> 00:19:45,589
shake hands like gentlemen
and part company.

452
00:19:53,364 --> 00:19:55,199
Ho! Lock up your women!

453
00:19:55,233 --> 00:19:56,366
Sammy's back.

454
00:19:57,338 --> 00:19:58,978
Sam, you know, I'm sorry

455
00:19:59,003 --> 00:20:01,238
to hear about
the termination there, buddy.

456
00:20:01,272 --> 00:20:02,439
Yeah, tough luck, pal.

457
00:20:02,473 --> 00:20:05,058
Yeah. Hey, easy come, easy go.

458
00:20:05,092 --> 00:20:07,927
No, truth is, it was a shock,

459
00:20:07,962 --> 00:20:09,078
but then I, uh...

460
00:20:09,113 --> 00:20:10,647
I went into
the executive washroom,

461
00:20:10,682 --> 00:20:12,322
and I splashed
some water on my face,

462
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:13,583
and I looked in the mirror,

463
00:20:13,618 --> 00:20:15,219
and the mirror
looked back and said,

464
00:20:15,252 --> 00:20:17,153
"You're not an executive, man.

465
00:20:17,188 --> 00:20:19,222
Get back to where you belong."

466
00:20:19,256 --> 00:20:20,524
All right.

467
00:20:20,558 --> 00:20:21,408
Yeah. Smart there.

468
00:20:21,442 --> 00:20:23,877
I thought they only had mirrors
like that in the movies.

469
00:20:26,915 --> 00:20:29,283
It's good to be back.

470
00:20:29,317 --> 00:20:31,051
Oh, Miss Howe will sure be relieved.
Yeah?

471
00:20:31,085 --> 00:20:32,419
She said that you'd be shattered

472
00:20:32,453 --> 00:20:34,121
and we should all
be really nice to you.

473
00:20:34,155 --> 00:20:36,189
She did, huh? Mm-hmm.

474
00:20:36,224 --> 00:20:39,026
Well... maybe I ought
to go set her mind at ease.

475
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:40,227
Ooh.

476
00:20:48,086 --> 00:20:49,753
Hi, Rebecca.

477
00:20:49,787 --> 00:20:52,122
Oh.

478
00:20:52,156 --> 00:20:53,990
How are you, Sam?

479
00:20:53,992 --> 00:20:57,077
Well, I'm kind of... shattered.

480
00:20:59,130 --> 00:21:00,563
I was afraid you might be.

481
00:21:00,598 --> 00:21:01,615
Do you mind

482
00:21:01,649 --> 00:21:03,250
if I stand here
for just a little while?

483
00:21:03,284 --> 00:21:05,285
It's kind of hard for me
to go back out there

484
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:07,037
after what happened.

485
00:21:07,072 --> 00:21:08,905
I feel so humiliated.

486
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:11,307
You just take
as long as you need.

487
00:21:21,552 --> 00:21:24,021
Would you like to talk about it?

488
00:21:24,055 --> 00:21:27,257
You mean about how bad I feel?

489
00:21:27,291 --> 00:21:29,909
Yeah, you know,
sometimes that helps.

490
00:21:30,945 --> 00:21:34,348
Well, I feel pretty bad.

491
00:21:34,382 --> 00:21:37,451
So... bad.

492
00:21:37,485 --> 00:21:38,885
I know.

493
00:21:38,919 --> 00:21:41,888
And I feel terrible
that I had to tell you.

494
00:21:41,922 --> 00:21:44,958
Oh, well there's no sense
in us both feeling so bad.

495
00:21:44,992 --> 00:21:47,227
Oh, God.

496
00:21:47,262 --> 00:21:50,164
I just hate to see you like this.
Oh... oh.

497
00:21:53,168 --> 00:21:54,268
You know... Hmm?

498
00:21:54,302 --> 00:21:56,503
Sometimes these things happen.

499
00:21:56,538 --> 00:21:59,173
But you will always
have your job here.

500
00:21:59,207 --> 00:22:01,808
Oh, it's not just
losing the job.

501
00:22:01,842 --> 00:22:05,546
It's that I was, you know,
taken advantage of.

502
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:08,182
I know. I know.

503
00:22:08,216 --> 00:22:10,284
You know, that I was used,

504
00:22:10,318 --> 00:22:13,119
that I was just,
you know, manipulated

505
00:22:13,154 --> 00:22:16,356
by somebody who just
cynically wanted to...

506
00:22:16,391 --> 00:22:17,991
get something from me.

507
00:22:20,361 --> 00:22:22,596
Malone, what are you doing?

508
00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:24,531
I-I'm feeling bad.

509
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:30,103
No, you are feeling pretty good.

510
00:22:30,137 --> 00:22:31,705
Okay, I admit it.

511
00:22:31,739 --> 00:22:33,373
I'm not a sad guy.

512
00:22:33,408 --> 00:22:35,609
I'm a happy, horny guy.

513
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:41,915
You know... we need pity, too.

514
00:22:41,949 --> 00:22:43,983
Oh, God, you are choice, Malone.

515
00:22:44,018 --> 00:22:45,785
You are just really choice.

516
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:48,322
You will do anything
for a roll in the hay.

517
00:22:48,356 --> 00:22:50,573
If you will play
on my sympathies,

518
00:22:50,607 --> 00:22:52,525
then you will stoop to anything.

519
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:55,762
God, I am tired of fighting you.

520
00:22:55,797 --> 00:22:56,997
I just don't have

521
00:22:57,031 --> 00:22:59,532
the strength to do it anymore.

522
00:22:59,651 --> 00:23:02,135
If this is what you really want,

523
00:23:02,169 --> 00:23:03,737
then by all means.

524
00:23:04,608 --> 00:23:06,248
Take me here. Take me now.

525
00:23:06,273 --> 00:23:08,207
Please, please.

526
00:23:09,610 --> 00:23:11,845
Are you serious?

527
00:23:11,879 --> 00:23:13,046
Oh, yes.

528
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:14,548
I want it bad.

529
00:23:19,487 --> 00:23:21,688
Well, all right.

530
00:23:32,366 --> 00:23:34,851
Is something wrong?

531
00:23:34,886 --> 00:23:36,152
Oh, nothing.

532
00:23:36,187 --> 00:23:38,321
Oh, baby, oh, baby.

533
00:23:45,046 --> 00:23:48,081
Le-Let me get this straight.

534
00:23:48,116 --> 00:23:49,816
Is this what I can expect

535
00:23:49,851 --> 00:23:54,304
<i>in the way
of full participation?</i>

536
00:23:54,338 --> 00:23:57,941
Until I get tired.

537
00:24:01,412 --> 00:24:04,314
Was it good for you?
