SITUATION ROOM

2
00:00:15,771 --> 00:00:18,835
>>> GOOD EVENING.
I'M WOLF BLITZER.

3
00:00:18,853 --> 00:00:23,226
AND IF I TAKE MY GLASSES OFF,
I'M BEAUTIFUL.

4
00:00:23,226 --> 00:00:28,917
LATER IN THE PROGRAM, I'LL HAVE
A LIVE CONVERSATION WITH ELON MUSK,

5
00:00:28,917 --> 00:00:33,287

MEDIA SITE X

9
00:00:46,025 --> 00:00:49,823

THE CAPITOL

10
00:00:49,919 --> 00:00:54,080

GEORGE
SANTOS.

12
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:03,110
IS GIVING HIS FINAL PRESS
CONFERENCE.

13
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:05,959
>> OKAY.
ENOUGH.

14
00:01:05,959 --> 00:01:08,656
ENOUGH, ENOUGH.

15
00:01:08,656 --> 00:01:13,397
EVERYONE, STOP ASSAULTING ME.
I'M BEING ASSAULTED.

16
00:01:13,397 --> 00:01:15,738
THIS ENTIRE COUNTRY HAS BEEN
BULLYING ME

17
00:01:15,738 --> 00:01:19,639
JUST BECAUSE I'M A
PROUD, GAY THIEF.

18
00:01:19,639 --> 00:01:25,068
WHAT ELSE IS NEW?
AMERICA HATES TO SEE A LATINA
QUEEN WINNING.

19
00:01:25,068 --> 00:01:28,238
SINCE THE DAY I WAS ELECTED,
IT'S BEEN A WITCH HUNT,

20
00:01:28,238 --> 00:01:30,331
BUT IF I'M GUILTY OF ANYTHING,

21
00:01:30,331 --> 00:01:34,250
IT'S FOR
LOVING TOO MUCH/FRAUD.

22
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:37,165
NOW I'M SURE YOU BLOOD THIRSTY
JACKALS IN THE MEDIA

23
00:01:37,165 --> 00:01:42,124
HAVE A
THOUSAND MEAN NASTY QUESTIONS
YOU'RE DYING TO ASK ME.
GO.

24
00:01:42,124 --> 00:01:45,393
>> YOU CALLED THIS PRESS
CONFERENCE.

25
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:47,123
NO ONE ASKED YOU TO DO THIS.

26
00:01:47,123 --> 00:01:49,227
>> WELL, AMERICA NEEDS CLOSURE.

27
00:01:49,227 --> 00:01:52,085
ONE OF THEIR FAVORITE SONS, ME,

28
00:01:52,085 --> 00:01:57,343
HAS BEEN CUT DOWN IN THE PRIME
OF HIS LIFE AT 17 YEARS OLD.

29
00:01:57,343 --> 00:02:01,737
AND FOR, WHAT?
SO THE GOVERNMENT CAN GO BACK TO
BUSINESS AS USUAL?

30
00:02:01,737 --> 00:02:03,737
WELL, I DON'T DO USUAL,

31
00:02:03,737 --> 00:02:08,569
AND I DO
BUSINESS AS DR. TONY GOLDMAN.

32
00:02:08,569 --> 00:02:10,280
OKAY.
WHO'S NEXT?

33
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:12,308
YOU.
NAME AND ROUTING NUMBER.

34
00:02:12,308 --> 00:02:13,477
>> NO.

35
00:02:13,477 --> 00:02:18,550
SO HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT BEING
THE ONLY -- ONLY THE SIXTH
CONGRESSMAN EVER EXPELLED FROM
OFFICE?

36
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:20,944
>> OH, BIG WHOOP.
YOU THINK I NEED THIS?

37
00:02:20,944 --> 00:02:23,086
YOU THINK I NEED ANY OF YOU?

38
00:02:23,086 --> 00:02:27,044
>> YOU FOLLOWED ME HOME AND
BEGGED ME TO ASK YOU MORE
QUESTIONS.

39
00:02:27,044 --> 00:02:31,187
>> OKAY.
FINE.
YOU WANT ME TO SAY THAT I'M
LOST, THAT I'M HUMILIATED?

40
00:02:31,187 --> 00:02:34,446
FINE, SO I'M NO LONGER
CONGRESSMAN SANTOS.

41
00:02:34,446 --> 00:02:37,663
I'M REGULAR OLD PROFESSOR

42
00:02:37,663 --> 00:02:42,884
MAY JON GENERAL ASTRONAUT SANTOS,

43
00:02:42,884 --> 00:02:48,697
PROTECTOR OF THE REALM, PRINCESS
OF GENOVIA.

44
00:02:53,532 --> 00:02:59,223
IS BEING EXPELLED AND PROSECUTED
FOR 23 FELONIES A SETBACK?
SURE.

45
00:02:59,223 --> 00:03:05,187
BUT I PROMISED MYSELF I WOULDN'T
LET IT RUIN MY KWANZAA.

46
00:03:05,187 --> 00:03:07,345
OKAY.
NEXT QUESTION.

47
00:03:07,345 --> 00:03:09,917
YOU, GIVE ME YOUR MOTHER'S
MAIDEN NAME AND CHILDHOOD PET.

48

DAMN IT!

50
00:03:13,224 --> 00:03:15,977
>> EXTREMELY HELPFUL.
THANK YOU.

51
00:03:15,977 --> 00:03:21,456
>> WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO SAY TO
ALL YOUR COLLEAGUES IN THE HOUSE
WHO VOTED TO EXPEL YOU?

52
00:03:21,456 --> 00:03:24,873
>> YOU KNOW WHAT I SAY?
TO HELL WITH CONGRESS.

53
00:03:24,873 --> 00:03:29,185
I DON'T NEED THEM ANYWAY BECAUSE
MY NEW MOVIE OPENED THIS
WEEKEND.

54
00:03:29,185 --> 00:03:33,154
IT'S CALLED RENAISSANCE, A FILM
BY BEYONCE.

55
00:03:34,506 --> 00:03:38,841
>> BUT YEARS FROM NOW, DO YOU
WORRY ABOUT HOW YOU'LL BE
REMEMBERED IN HISTORY?

56
00:03:38,841 --> 00:03:41,542

THE WOMEN'S SECTION STARTED OUT

135
00:11:22,306 --> 00:11:26,625
 AS  A SMALL, QUIET PLACE TO CRY,

136

>> DAMN.

249

00:31:23,565 --> 00:31:25,265
FINGER BASIN AND A BOWL?

648
00:31:25,267 --> 00:31:26,833
>> MY HUSBAND SAID I COULDN'T

649
00:31:26,835 --> 00:31:28,268
BRING HOME ANY MORE BOWLS.

650
00:31:28,270 --> 00:31:28,835
>> BEEN THERE.

651
00:31:28,837 --> 00:31:32,606
>> SO I MADE THREE FINGER

652
00:31:32,608 --> 00:31:32,940
BASINS.

653
00:31:32,942 --> 00:31:35,008
I WANTED TO MAKE SOMETHING

654
00:31:35,010 --> 00:31:36,743
STACKABLE SO THEY USE LESS

655
00:31:36,745 --> 00:31:37,077
SPACE.

656
00:31:37,079 --> 00:31:38,111
>> THAT'S A SMART IDEA.

657
00:31:38,113 --> 00:31:38,612
>> HERE THEY ARE.

658
00:31:38,614 --> 00:31:41,882
>> OH, INCREDIBLE.

659
00:31:41,884 --> 00:31:42,182
WOW.

660
00:31:42,184 --> 00:31:44,217
GOSH, THEY JUST DISAPPEAR INTO

661
00:31:44,219 --> 00:31:45,419
EACH OTHER.

662
00:31:45,421 --> 00:31:47,254
>> YEAH, AND THERE'S THREE OF

663
00:31:47,256 --> 00:31:50,023
THEM, SO IF YOU STILL HAVE ONE

664
00:31:50,025 --> 00:31:51,925
LEFT OVER IF YOUR HUSBAND

665
00:31:51,927 --> 00:31:53,727
ACCIDENTALLY DROPS TWO WHEN

666
00:31:53,729 --> 00:31:54,528
YOU'RE OUT OF THE ROOM.

667
00:31:54,530 --> 00:31:57,364
>> HE IS SO CLUMSY.

668
00:31:57,366 --> 00:31:58,398
>> HE IS.

669
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:00,534
I LOVE THE REACTION MY FAMILY

670
00:32:00,536 --> 00:32:03,603
HAS WHEN THEY OPEN ONE OF MY

671
00:32:03,605 --> 00:32:04,771
HAND-MADE BOWLS.

672
00:32:04,773 --> 00:32:13,046
IT'S LIKE, WHA -- WHA -- WHOA.

673
00:32:13,048 --> 00:32:13,347
WHOA.

674
00:32:13,349 --> 00:32:13,647
WHOA.

675
00:32:13,649 --> 00:32:15,182
>> I GET THAT TOO.

676
00:32:15,184 --> 00:32:16,850
WELL, OUR GUEST TODAY HAS BEEN

677
00:32:16,852 --> 00:32:18,085
MAKING INCREDIBLE GIFTS HERE FOR

678
00:32:18,087 --> 00:32:19,319
THE PAST THREE YEARS.

679
00:32:19,321 --> 00:32:21,321
>> SHE'S AN AMATEUR POTTER BUT

680
00:32:21,323 --> 00:32:23,690
THE STAR OF OUR STUDIO.

681
00:32:23,692 --> 00:32:31,898
WE'RE SO EXCITED TO WELCOME CODY

682
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:32,366

683
00:32:32,368 --> 00:32:32,766
>> WELCOME.

684
00:32:32,768 --> 00:32:33,834

685
00:32:33,836 --> 00:32:37,070
SORRY MY HANDS ARE A LITTLE

686
00:32:37,072 --> 00:32:37,404
SCUFFED.

687
00:32:37,406 --> 00:32:41,541
WE HAD TO WRANGLE A POSSUM OUT

688
00:32:41,543 --> 00:32:42,042
OF THE COMPOST.

689
00:32:42,044 --> 00:32:43,510
>> WE ARE SO HONORED.

690
00:32:43,512 --> 00:32:44,578
YOUR STUFF IS AMAZING.

691
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:46,613
>> I LOVE THAT POTTERY IS SO

692
00:32:46,615 --> 00:32:46,980
PERSONAL.

693
00:32:46,982 --> 00:32:48,415
THESE DAYS PEOPLE DON'T WANT

694
00:32:48,417 --> 00:32:50,150
SOMETHING MADE BY A MACHINE.

695
00:32:50,152 --> 00:32:52,652
THEY WANT SOMETHING MADE BY A

696
00:32:52,654 --> 00:32:54,955
PREMENOPAUSAL LADY IN A FLEECE

697
00:32:54,957 --> 00:32:55,255
VEST.

698
00:32:55,257 --> 00:32:56,757
>> THAT IS SO TRUE.

699
00:32:56,759 --> 00:32:58,859
PEOPLE, CODY'S STUFF IS ON

700

IT'S LIKE NIGHT AND DAY.

709
00:33:10,339 --> 00:33:11,238
>> NIGHT AND DAY.

710
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:13,140

736
00:33:54,249 --> 00:33:56,550
BUT YOU MAKE MORE THAN BOWLS,

737
00:33:56,552 --> 00:33:56,850

I WASN'T GOING TO SHARE.

744
00:34:04,059 --> 00:34:07,160
OH, ALL RIGHT.

745
00:34:07,162 --> 00:34:07,694

>> I DON'T WANT TO BE TOO

753
00:34:18,707 --> 00:34:20,974
FORWARD, BUT IS THAT A REPLICA

754
00:34:20,976 --> 00:34:23,944
OF YOUR VAGINA?

755
00:34:23,946 --> 00:34:24,744
>> NO.

756
00:34:24,746 --> 00:34:27,214
NO, NO, NO.

757
00:34:27,216 --> 00:34:30,517
IT IS A REPLICA OF MY MOTHER'S

758
00:34:30,519 --> 00:34:30,851
VAGINA.

759
00:34:30,853 --> 00:34:32,519
>> OH, SURE, SURE.

760
00:34:32,521 --> 00:34:36,289
>> AT FIRST, I THOUGHT IT WAS A

761
00:34:36,291 --> 00:34:36,623
CABBAGE.

762
00:34:36,625 --> 00:34:38,258
I SEE IT NOW.

763
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:39,126
THE VAGINA.

764
00:34:39,128 --> 00:34:44,331
>> NOW, WHEN YOU SCULPT YOUR

765
00:34:44,333 --> 00:34:47,400
MOTHER'S VAGINA, DO YOU USE A

766
00:34:47,402 --> 00:34:48,268
PICTURE AS A REFERENCE?

767
00:34:48,270 --> 00:34:48,835
>> OF COURSE.

768
00:34:48,837 --> 00:34:53,907
I WANTED TO BE ACCURATE.

769
00:34:53,909 --> 00:34:54,641
>> AND WHERE DO YOU GET A PHOTO

770
00:34:54,643 --> 00:34:55,008

771
00:34:55,010 --> 00:34:55,509

773
00:34:56,278 --> 00:34:59,446
I WOULD PAY BIG BUCKS FOR

774
00:34:59,448 --> 00:35:00,013
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

>> IT'S ACTUALLY FOR SALE.

776
00:35:01,150 --> 00:35:03,350
I WOULD BE HAPPY TO SELL IT TO

777
00:35:03,352 --> 00:35:05,185
EITHER OF YOU RIGHT NOW.

778
00:35:05,187 --> 00:35:06,086
I'M KIDDING.

779
00:35:06,088 --> 00:35:09,189
I WAS WORRIED THAT MY MOTHER'S

780
00:35:09,191 --> 00:35:10,957
VAGINA WOULD BE A TOUGH SALE,

781
00:35:10,959 --> 00:35:12,859
BUT THANKFULLY I FOUND A BUYER.

782
00:35:12,861 --> 00:35:13,727

ALL RIGHT.

1041
00:44:30,485 --> 00:44:31,517
I'LL PLAY ALONG.

1042
00:44:31,519 --> 00:44:32,719
>> THANK YOU FOR COMING.

1043
00:44:32,721 --> 00:44:33,553
HOW ARE YOU DOING?

1044
00:44:33,555 --> 00:44:35,888
>> COLIN, I'VE BEEN BETTER.

1045
00:44:35,890 --> 00:44:37,757
IT AIN'T EASY BEING A CIGARETTE

1046
00:44:37,759 --> 00:44:38,491
THESE DAYS.

1047
00:44:38,493 --> 00:44:40,760
EVERYONE WANTS TO VAPE.

1048
00:44:40,762 --> 00:44:42,795
OOH, LET'S VAPE.

1049
00:44:42,797 --> 00:44:43,329
CAN I HIT YOUR VAPE?

1050
00:44:43,331 --> 00:44:44,063
AND NOW LOOK, THE CHILDREN ARE

1051
00:44:44,065 --> 00:44:46,165
DEAD.

1052
00:44:46,167 --> 00:44:47,433
GREAT JOB, GUYS.

1053
00:44:47,435 --> 00:44:49,001
VAPES ARE SO MUCH BETTER.

1054
00:44:49,003 --> 00:44:50,570
>> THAT'S NOT WHAT'S HAPPENING.

1055
00:44:50,572 --> 00:44:51,771
ALSO, YOU'RE NOT SO INNOCENT

1056

YOURSELF.

1057
00:44:52,140 --> 00:44:57,009
I MEAN, BEFORE VAPES, KIDS

DEFINITELY SMOKED CIGARETTES.

1059
00:44:57,712 --> 00:44:58,044
>> TRUE.

1060
00:44:58,046 --> 00:44:59,579
BUT THEY LOOKED COOL DOING IT,

1061
00:44:59,581 --> 00:45:00,346
SO IT WAS FINE.

1062
00:45:00,348 --> 00:45:02,315
YOU EVER SEE A KID VAPE?

1063
00:45:02,317 --> 00:45:04,317
THEY DON'T EVEN DO IT WITH

1064
00:45:04,319 --> 00:45:04,717
CONFIDENCE.

1065
00:45:04,719 --> 00:45:06,719
BLOWING IT DOWN THEIR LITTLE

1066
00:45:06,721 --> 00:45:07,587
SHIRTS, DORKS.

1067
00:45:07,589 --> 00:45:08,554
>> OKAY.

1068
00:45:08,556 --> 00:45:09,589
ALL RIGHT.

1069
00:45:09,591 --> 00:45:12,658
CIGARETTES ARE STILL BAD,

1070
00:45:12,660 --> 00:45:12,992
THOUGH.

1071
00:45:12,994 --> 00:45:15,495
>> THEY DON'T EVEN HAVE COOL

1072
00:45:15,497 --> 00:45:16,763
NICKNAMES FOR VAPES.

1073
00:45:16,765 --> 00:45:18,898
DO YOU KNOW WHAT THEY CALL A

1074
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:19,999
CIGARETTE IN LONDON?

1075
00:45:20,001 --> 00:45:20,433
>> YES, I DO.

1076
00:45:20,435 --> 00:45:22,668
>> SAY IT.

1077
00:45:22,670 --> 00:45:24,036
>> I'M NOT GONNA SAY IT.

1078
00:45:24,038 --> 00:45:25,204
>> RELAX.

1079
00:45:25,206 --> 00:45:26,906
NO ONE'S GOING TO TAKE IT OUT OF

1080
00:45:26,908 --> 00:45:29,108
CONTEXT AND MAKE IT A MEME.

1081
00:45:29,110 --> 00:45:29,776
>> ALL RIGHT.

1082
00:45:29,778 --> 00:45:31,244
WELL, IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE NOT

1083
00:45:31,246 --> 00:45:32,645
A FAN OF VAPES.

1084
00:45:32,647 --> 00:45:33,846
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT

1085
00:45:33,848 --> 00:45:35,448
AUSTRALIA AND OTHER COUNTRIES

1086
00:45:35,450 --> 00:45:36,415
TRYING TO BAN THEM?

1087
00:45:36,417 --> 00:45:38,651
>> WELCOME TO THE SHOW, VAPES.

1088
00:45:38,653 --> 00:45:39,418
FIRST TIME?

1089
00:45:39,420 --> 00:45:41,487
THEY USED TO LOVE ME TOO.

1090
00:45:41,489 --> 00:45:43,489
NOW THEY'RE TRYING TO MAKE ME DO

1091
00:45:43,491 --> 00:45:45,558
GO THE WAY OF THE DO-DO.

1092
00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:46,325
IT'LL NEVER WORK.

1093
00:45:46,327 --> 00:45:47,960
YOU KNOW HOW GOOD SMOKING A

1094
00:45:47,962 --> 00:45:48,394
CIGARETTE IS?

1095
00:45:48,396 --> 00:45:53,099
WE'RE DESSERT FOR SEX.

1096
00:45:53,101 --> 00:45:58,137
HEY, THAT SEX WAS GOOD, BUT YOU

1097
00:45:58,139 --> 00:45:58,805
KNOW WHAT I WANT RIGHT NOW?

1098
00:45:58,807 --> 00:45:59,172
ME, BABY.

1099
00:45:59,174 --> 00:45:59,539
>> YEAH.

1100
00:45:59,541 --> 00:46:00,306
HOW DO YOU THINK YOU'VE BEEN

1101
00:46:00,308 --> 00:46:01,741
ABLE TO STICK AROUND THIS LONG?

1102
00:46:01,743 --> 00:46:03,009
>> I'M COOL.

1103
00:46:03,011 --> 00:46:05,511
AND YOU'RE COOL IF YOU SMOKE ME.

1104
00:46:05,513 --> 00:46:07,046
NBC PROBABLY DOESN'T WANT ME

1105
00:46:07,048 --> 00:46:08,815
SAYING THIS DIRECTLY TO KIDS,

1106
00:46:08,817 --> 00:46:10,116
BUT SMOKING MAKES YOU SKINNY AND

1107
00:46:10,118 --> 00:46:14,921
POPULAR.

1108
00:46:14,923 --> 00:46:15,822
AND FOR GUYS, IT ADDS A COUPLE

1109
00:46:15,824 --> 00:46:20,459
INCHES.

1110
00:46:20,461 --> 00:46:21,627
>> CIGARETTE, COME ON.

1111
00:46:21,629 --> 00:46:22,395
>> I KNOW.

1112
00:46:22,397 --> 00:46:23,296
I KNOW.

1113
00:46:23,298 --> 00:46:24,030
I'M BAD.

1114
00:46:24,032 --> 00:46:25,865
BUT GOD I LOOK GOOD.

1115
00:46:25,867 --> 00:46:28,100
CAN'T SAY THE SAME FOR VAPES.

1116
00:46:28,102 --> 00:46:30,837
LOOK AT THESE STUDS ON TEAM

1117
00:46:30,839 --> 00:46:31,237

00:46:34,576 --> 00:46:36,342
>> COOL GUY NUMBER ONE IN MY

1120
00:46:36,344 --> 00:46:36,609

WHO ELSE?

1122
00:46:37,312 --> 00:46:38,511
>> ELIZABETH TAYLOR.

1123
00:46:38,513 --> 00:46:39,412
SOUTHEAST COOL TOO.

1124
00:46:39,414 --> 00:46:43,015
>> SHE'S LIKE MARLIN BRANDO BUT

1125
00:46:43,017 --> 00:46:45,017
GIRL.

1126
00:46:45,019 --> 00:46:45,484
KEEP IT GOING.

1127
00:46:45,486 --> 00:46:46,953
>> RON JEREMY?

1128
00:46:46,955 --> 00:46:47,854

00:46:51,559 --> 00:46:52,992
>> ISN'T HE IN PRISON FOR

1132
00:46:52,994 --> 00:46:53,893
SOMETHING HORRIBLE?

1133
00:46:53,895 --> 00:46:55,428
>> NOT HIM THEN.

1134
00:46:55,430 --> 00:46:58,431
STILL, THOUGH, TAYLOR AND

1135
00:46:58,433 --> 00:46:58,764
BRANDO.

1136
00:46:58,766 --> 00:46:59,599
NOT BAD.

1137
00:46:59,601 --> 00:47:00,299
LOOK WHO THEY'VE GOT ON TEAM

1139
00:47:02,570 --> 00:47:04,370
JUST SAYING.

1140
00:47:04,372 --> 00:47:06,272
>> VAPES DIDN'T EVEN EXIST BACK

1141
00:47:06,274 --> 00:47:06,572
THEN.

1142
00:47:06,574 --> 00:47:07,006
>> OH, OKAY.

1143
00:47:07,008 --> 00:47:10,042
DEFEND HIM.

1144
00:47:10,044 --> 00:47:11,878
>> I'M NOT DEFENDING -- ALL

1145
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:13,713
RIGHT.

1146
00:47:13,715 --> 00:47:14,146
YOU KNOW WHAT?

1147
00:47:14,148 --> 00:47:14,914
NO MORE PICTURES.

1148
00:47:14,916 --> 00:47:16,382
>> ONE MORE PICTURE.

1149
00:47:16,384 --> 00:47:17,884
IT'LL BE GOOD THIS TIME.

1150

FINE.

1153
00:47:19,420 --> 00:47:19,952
ONE MORE.

1154
00:47:19,954 --> 00:47:20,853
IT'S THE SAME ONE!

1155
00:47:20,855 --> 00:47:22,521
>> I DID THE SAME PICTURE.

1156
00:47:22,523 --> 00:47:23,890
