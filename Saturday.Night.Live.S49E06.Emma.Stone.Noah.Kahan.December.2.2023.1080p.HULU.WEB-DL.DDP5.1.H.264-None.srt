SITUATION ROOM

2
00:00:15,771 --> 00:00:18,835
>>> GOOD EVENING.
I'M WOLF BLITZER.

3
00:00:18,853 --> 00:00:23,226
AND IF I TAKE MY GLASSES OFF,
I'M BEAUTIFUL.

4
00:00:23,226 --> 00:00:28,917
LATER IN THE PROGRAM, I'LL HAVE
A LIVE CONVERSATION WITH ELON MUSK,

5
00:00:28,917 --> 00:00:33,287

9
00:00:46,025 --> 00:00:49,823

00:00:49,919 --> 00:00:54,080

GEORGE
SANTOS.

12
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:03,110
IS GIVING HIS FINAL PRESS
CONFERENCE.

13
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:05,959
>> OKAY.
ENOUGH.

14
00:01:05,959 --> 00:01:08,656
ENOUGH, ENOUGH.

15
00:01:08,656 --> 00:01:13,397
EVERYONE, STOP ASSAULTING ME.
I'M BEING ASSAULTED.

16
00:01:13,397 --> 00:01:15,738
THIS ENTIRE COUNTRY HAS BEEN
BULLYING ME

17
00:01:15,738 --> 00:01:19,639
JUST BECAUSE I'M A
PROUD, GAY THIEF.

18
00:01:19,639 --> 00:01:25,068
WHAT ELSE IS NEW?
AMERICA HATES TO SEE A LATINA
QUEEN WINNING.

19
00:01:25,068 --> 00:01:28,238
SINCE THE DAY I WAS ELECTED,
IT'S BEEN A WITCH HUNT,

20
00:01:28,238 --> 00:01:30,331
BUT IF I'M GUILTY OF ANYTHING,

21
00:01:30,331 --> 00:01:34,250
IT'S FOR
LOVING TOO MUCH/FRAUD.

22
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:37,165
NOW I'M SURE YOU BLOOD THIRSTY
JACKALS IN THE MEDIA

23
00:01:37,165 --> 00:01:42,124
HAVE A
THOUSAND MEAN NASTY QUESTIONS
YOU'RE DYING TO ASK ME.
GO.

24
00:01:42,124 --> 00:01:45,393
>> YOU CALLED THIS PRESS
CONFERENCE.

25
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:47,123
NO ONE ASKED YOU TO DO THIS.

26
00:01:47,123 --> 00:01:49,227
>> WELL, AMERICA NEEDS CLOSURE.

27
00:01:49,227 --> 00:01:52,085
ONE OF THEIR FAVORITE SONS, ME,

28
00:01:52,085 --> 00:01:57,343
HAS BEEN CUT DOWN IN THE PRIME
OF HIS LIFE AT 17 YEARS OLD.

29
00:01:57,343 --> 00:02:01,737
AND FOR, WHAT?
SO THE GOVERNMENT CAN GO BACK TO
BUSINESS AS USUAL?

30
00:02:01,737 --> 00:02:03,737
WELL, I DON'T DO USUAL,

31
00:02:03,737 --> 00:02:08,569
AND I DO
BUSINESS AS DR. TONY GOLDMAN.

32
00:02:08,569 --> 00:02:10,280
OKAY.
WHO'S NEXT?

33
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:12,308
YOU.
NAME AND ROUTING NUMBER.

34
00:02:12,308 --> 00:02:13,477
>> NO.

35
00:02:13,477 --> 00:02:18,550
SO HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT BEING
THE ONLY -- ONLY THE SIXTH
CONGRESSMAN EVER EXPELLED FROM
OFFICE?

36
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:20,944
>> OH, BIG WHOOP.
YOU THINK I NEED THIS?

37
00:02:20,944 --> 00:02:23,086
YOU THINK I NEED ANY OF YOU?

38
00:02:23,086 --> 00:02:27,044
>> YOU FOLLOWED ME HOME AND
BEGGED ME TO ASK YOU MORE
QUESTIONS.

39
00:02:27,044 --> 00:02:31,187
>> OKAY.
FINE.
YOU WANT ME TO SAY THAT I'M
LOST, THAT I'M HUMILIATED?

40
00:02:31,187 --> 00:02:34,446
FINE, SO I'M NO LONGER
CONGRESSMAN SANTOS.

41
00:02:34,446 --> 00:02:37,663
I'M REGULAR OLD PROFESSOR

42

43
00:02:42,884 --> 00:02:48,697
PROTECTOR OF THE REALM, PRINCESS
OF GENOVIA.

44
00:02:53,532 --> 00:02:59,223
IS BEING EXPELLED AND PROSECUTED
FOR 23 FELONIES A SETBACK?
SURE.

45
00:02:59,223 --> 00:03:05,187
BUT I PROMISED MYSELF I WOULDN'T
LET IT RUIN MY KWANZAA.

46
00:03:05,187 --> 00:03:07,345
OKAY.
NEXT QUESTION.

47
00:03:07,345 --> 00:03:09,917

DAMN IT!

50
00:03:13,224 --> 00:03:15,977
>> EXTREMELY HELPFUL.
THANK YOU.

51
00:03:15,977 --> 00:03:21,456
>> WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO SAY TO
ALL YOUR COLLEAGUES IN THE HOUSE
WHO VOTED TO EXPEL YOU?

52
00:03:21,456 --> 00:03:24,873
>> YOU KNOW WHAT I SAY?
TO HELL WITH CONGRESS.

53
00:03:24,873 --> 00:03:29,185
I DON'T NEED THEM ANYWAY BECAUSE
MY NEW MOVIE OPENED THIS
WEEKEND.

54
00:03:29,185 --> 00:03:33,154
IT'S CALLED RENAISSANCE, A FILM
BY BEYONCE.

55
00:03:34,506 --> 00:03:38,841

WORRY ABOUT HOW YOU'LL BE
REMEMBERED IN HISTORY?

56
00:03:38,841 --> 00:03:41,542

THE WOMEN'S SECTION STARTED OUT

135
00:11:22,306 --> 00:11:26,625
AS  A SMALL, QUIET PLACE TO CRY,

136

CONGRATS

195

YOU'VE WON A LARGE CRATE OF

>> I'M NOT SURE I CAN TAKE CARE
OF A TORTOISE FOR THE REST OF MY
LIFE.

201
00:15:47,117 --> 00:15:50,510
>> THEN KILL HIM, TOUGH GUY.
YOU WON'T.

202
00:15:53,501 --> 00:15:56,109
OUR NEXT QUESTION IS FROM THE
WORLD OF SPORTS.

203
00:15:56,109 --> 00:16:00,772
WHO BROKE ROGER MARIS' RECORD
FOR THE MOST HOME RUNS IN AN MLB
SEASON?

204
00:16:00,772 --> 00:16:04,907
MICHELLE?
>> ST. LOUIS NATIVE HERE.
THAT WOULD BE MARK McGUIRE.

205
00:16:04,907 --> 00:16:08,322
>> THAT'S RIGHT.
>> OH, THANK GOD.
DOES SHE GET THE TORTOISE?

206
00:16:08,322 --> 00:16:10,889
>> LET'S SEE.
JACK, TELL HER WHAT SHE'S WON.

207
00:16:10,889 --> 00:16:13,639
>> THREE CARS.

208
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:18,291
TAKE ALL THREE.
CONGRATULATIONS, MICHELLE.

209
00:16:18,291 --> 00:16:20,618
>> THAT IS NOT FAIR.

210
00:16:20,618 --> 00:16:24,799
>> FINE.
I'LL GIVE MICHELLE AND ANGELA A
CHANCE TO STEAL SPEEDY AWAY FROM
YOU.

211
00:16:24,799 --> 00:16:27,740
ALL THEY HAVE TO DO IS ANSWER
ONE QUESTION RIGHT.

212
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:29,951
WHAT DO THESE TWO MEN HAVE IN
COMMON?

213
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:32,723
CHARLES DARWIN AND STEVE ERWIN.

214
00:16:32,723 --> 00:16:34,997
>> THEY BOTH STUDIED ANIMALS.

215
00:16:34,997 --> 00:16:37,302
>> YES, BUT NOT WHAT WE'RE
LOOKING FOR.

216
00:16:37,302 --> 00:16:40,195
>> SAME COLOR PENIS.

217
00:16:40,195 --> 00:16:49,557
>> PROBABLY.

218
00:16:49,559 --> 00:16:51,225
BUT NOT WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR.

219
00:16:51,227 --> 00:16:51,659
>> JEN?

220
00:16:51,661 --> 00:16:53,528
>> I AM NOT GUESSING ANYMORE.

221
00:16:53,530 --> 00:16:54,328
>> WHO CARES.

222
00:16:54,330 --> 00:16:55,396
THE ANSWER IS THEY BOTH OWNED

223
00:16:55,398 --> 00:16:58,933
THE SAME TORTOISE.

224
00:16:58,935 --> 00:16:59,867
>> WHAT?

225
00:16:59,869 --> 00:17:01,135
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

226
00:17:01,137 --> 00:17:01,936
>> IT SHOULD BE.

227
00:17:01,938 --> 00:17:02,470
IT REALLY SHOULD BE.

228
00:17:02,472 --> 00:17:05,540
BUT IT'S NOT.

229
00:17:05,542 --> 00:17:08,443

233
00:17:13,183 --> 00:17:14,015
IS THAT NOT SOMETHING?

234
00:17:14,017 --> 00:17:14,849
>> DAMN.

235
00:17:14,851 --> 00:17:17,185
IF I WON THAT LITTLE DINOSAUR, I

236
00:17:17,187 --> 00:17:19,654
COULD START MY OWN JURASSIC

237
00:17:19,656 --> 00:17:19,954
PARK.

238
00:17:19,956 --> 00:17:24,192
AND IT COMES WITH A SIDE SALAD?

239
00:17:24,194 --> 00:17:25,026
YOU GOT IT MADE.

240
00:17:25,028 --> 00:17:26,194

242
00:17:28,665 --> 00:17:29,363
PLAYED.

243
00:17:29,365 --> 00:17:31,032
ANGELA, SINCE YOU LIKE SPEEDY,

244

00:17:55,692 --> 00:17:57,158
>> I CAN'T -- I CAN'T READ THAT.

255
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,092

>> WHY DID YOU DO THIS TO ME?

263
00:18:11,007 --> 00:18:13,274
>> BECAUSE IT WAS DONE TO ME.

264
00:18:13,276 --> 00:18:15,209
I WOULD SAY JOIN US NEXT WEEK,

265

IT'S MY BEST YET.

I LIKE HOW HEAVY IT IS.

621
00:31:08,250 --> 00:31:09,616
IT'S LIKE A WORKOUT TO DRINK OUT

OF IT.

623
00:31:10,019 --> 00:31:10,651
>> RIGHT?

624
00:31:10,653 --> 00:31:12,619
AND IT NEVER LOOKS DIRTY BECAUSE

WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A

633
00:31:23,565 --> 00:31:25,265
FINGER BASIN AND A BOWL?

634

I WANTED TO MAKE SOMETHING

640
00:31:35,010 --> 00:31:36,743
STACKABLE SO THEY USE LESS

641
00:31:36,745 --> 00:31:37,077
SPACE.

642
00:31:37,079 --> 00:31:38,111
>> THAT'S A SMART IDEA.

643
00:31:38,113 --> 00:31:38,612

I'LL PLAY ALONG.

1028
00:44:31,519 --> 00:44:32,719
>> THANK YOU FOR COMING.

1029
00:44:32,721 --> 00:44:33,553
HOW ARE YOU DOING?

>> COLIN, I'VE BEEN BETTER.

1031
00:44:35,890 --> 00:44:37,757
IT AIN'T EASY BEING A CIGARETTE

00:44:37,759 --> 00:44:38,491
THESE DAYS.

1033
00:44:38,493 --> 00:44:40,760
EVERYONE WANTS TO VAPE.

1034
00:44:40,762 --> 00:44:42,795
OOH, LET'S VAPE.

1035
00:44:42,797 --> 00:44:43,329
CAN I HIT YOUR VAPE?

1036
00:44:43,331 --> 00:44:44,063
AND NOW LOOK, THE CHILDREN ARE

1037
00:44:44,065 --> 00:44:46,165
DEAD.

1038
00:44:46,167 --> 00:44:47,433
GREAT JOB, GUYS.

1039
00:44:47,435 --> 00:44:49,001
VAPES ARE SO MUCH BETTER.

1040
00:44:49,003 --> 00:44:50,570
>> THAT'S NOT WHAT'S HAPPENING.

1041

DEFINITELY SMOKED CIGARETTES.

1045
00:44:57,712 --> 00:44:58,044

BUT THEY LOOKED COOL DOING IT,

1047
00:44:59,581 --> 00:45:00,346
SO IT WAS FINE.

1048
00:45:00,348 --> 00:45:02,315
YOU EVER SEE A KID VAPE?

1049
00:45:02,317 --> 00:45:04,317
THEY DON'T EVEN DO IT WITH

1050
00:45:04,319 --> 00:45:04,717
CONFIDENCE.

1051
00:45:04,719 --> 00:45:06,719
BLOWING IT DOWN THEIR LITTLE

1052

ALL RIGHT.

1055

CIGARETTES ARE STILL BAD,

1056
00:45:12,660 --> 00:45:12,992
THOUGH.

1057
00:45:12,994 --> 00:45:15,495
>> THEY DON'T EVEN HAVE COOL

1058
00:45:15,497 --> 00:45:16,763
NICKNAMES FOR VAPES.

1059
00:45:16,765 --> 00:45:18,898
DO YOU KNOW WHAT THEY CALL A

1060
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:19,999
CIGARETTE IN LONDON?

1061
00:45:20,001 --> 00:45:20,433
>> YES, I DO.

1062
00:45:20,435 --> 00:45:22,668

1063

>> I'M NOT GONNA SAY IT.

1064
00:45:24,038 --> 00:45:25,204
>> RELAX.

1065
00:45:25,206 --> 00:45:26,906
NO ONE'S GOING TO TAKE IT OUT OF

1066
00:45:26,908 --> 00:45:29,108
CONTEXT AND MAKE IT A MEME.

1067
00:45:29,110 --> 00:45:29,776
>> ALL RIGHT.

1068
00:45:29,778 --> 00:45:31,244
WELL, IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE NOT

1069
00:45:31,246 --> 00:45:32,645
A FAN OF VAPES.

1070
00:45:32,647 --> 00:45:33,846
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT

1071
00:45:33,848 --> 00:45:35,448
AUSTRALIA AND OTHER COUNTRIES

1072
00:45:35,450 --> 00:45:36,415
TRYING TO BAN THEM?

1073
00:45:36,417 --> 00:45:38,651
>> WELCOME TO THE SHOW, VAPES.

1074
00:45:38,653 --> 00:45:39,418
FIRST TIME?

1075
00:45:39,420 --> 00:45:41,487
THEY USED TO LOVE ME TOO.

1076
00:45:41,489 --> 00:45:43,489
NOW THEY'RE TRYING TO MAKE ME DO

1077
00:45:43,491 --> 00:45:45,558
GO THE WAY OF THE DO-DO.

1078
00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:46,325
IT'LL NEVER WORK.

1079
00:45:46,327 --> 00:45:47,960
YOU KNOW HOW GOOD SMOKING A

1080
00:45:47,962 --> 00:45:48,394
CIGARETTE IS?

1081
00:45:48,396 --> 00:45:53,099
WE'RE DESSERT FOR SEX.

1082
00:45:53,101 --> 00:45:58,137
HEY, THAT SEX WAS GOOD, BUT YOU

1083
00:45:58,139 --> 00:45:58,805
KNOW WHAT I WANT RIGHT NOW?

1084
00:45:58,807 --> 00:45:59,172
ME, BABY.

1085
00:45:59,174 --> 00:45:59,539
>> YEAH.

1086
00:45:59,541 --> 00:46:00,306
HOW DO YOU THINK YOU'VE BEEN

1087
00:46:00,308 --> 00:46:01,741
ABLE TO STICK AROUND THIS LONG?

1088
00:46:01,743 --> 00:46:03,009
>> I'M COOL.

1089
00:46:03,011 --> 00:46:05,511
AND YOU'RE COOL IF YOU SMOKE ME.

1090
00:46:05,513 --> 00:46:07,046
NBC PROBABLY DOESN'T WANT ME

1091
00:46:07,048 --> 00:46:08,815
SAYING THIS DIRECTLY TO KIDS,

1092
00:46:08,817 --> 00:46:10,116
BUT SMOKING MAKES YOU SKINNY AND

1093
00:46:10,118 --> 00:46:14,921
POPULAR.

1094
00:46:14,923 --> 00:46:15,822
AND FOR GUYS, IT ADDS A COUPLE

1095
00:46:15,824 --> 00:46:20,459
INCHES.

1096
00:46:20,461 --> 00:46:21,627
>> CIGARETTE, COME ON.

1097
00:46:21,629 --> 00:46:22,395
>> I KNOW.

1098
00:46:22,397 --> 00:46:23,296
I KNOW.

1099
00:46:23,298 --> 00:46:24,030
I'M BAD.

1100
00:46:24,032 --> 00:46:25,865
BUT GOD I LOOK GOOD.

1101
00:46:25,867 --> 00:46:28,100
CAN'T SAY THE SAME FOR VAPES.

1102
00:46:28,102 --> 00:46:30,837
LOOK AT THESE STUDS ON TEAM

00:46:43,017 --> 00:46:45,017
GIRL.

1112
00:46:45,019 --> 00:46:45,484
KEEP IT GOING.

1113

1118
00:46:52,994 --> 00:46:53,893
SOMETHING HORRIBLE?

1119
00:46:53,895 --> 00:46:55,428
>> NOT HIM THEN.

1120
00:46:55,430 --> 00:46:58,431
STILL, THOUGH, TAYLOR AND

1121
00:46:58,433 --> 00:46:58,764
BRANDO.

1122
00:46:58,766 --> 00:46:59,599
NOT BAD.

1123
00:46:59,601 --> 00:47:00,299

JUST SAYING.

1126
00:47:04,372 --> 00:47:06,272

1128
00:47:06,574 --> 00:47:07,006

DEFEND HIM.

1130
00:47:10,044 --> 00:47:11,878
>> I'M NOT DEFENDING -- ALL

1131
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:13,713
RIGHT.

1132
00:47:13,715 --> 00:47:14,146

1133
00:47:14,148 --> 00:47:14,914
NO MORE PICTURES.
