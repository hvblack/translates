1
00:00:00,605 --> 00:00:05,180
>>> EASTER, THE CELEBRATION OF
THE RESURRECTED CHRIST.

2
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:08,371
THE BIBLE TELLS US JESUS
TRAVELED TO JERUSALEM FOR PASSOVER

3
00:00:08,371 --> 00:00:11,648
WHERE HIS MESSAGE OF
PEACE AND LOVE ENRAGED THE
AUTHORITIES.

4
00:00:11,648 --> 00:00:15,827
IN THE COMING DAYS, HE WILL BE
ARRESTED, TRIED, AND EXECUTED.

5
00:00:15,827 --> 00:00:20,065
THIS HE TELLS HIS DISCIPLES ON
THEIR FINAL EVENING TOGETHER,

6
00:00:20,065 --> 00:00:22,083
A MEAL WILL COME TO CALL.

7
00:00:22,083 --> 00:00:24,735
THE LAST SUPPER.

8
00:00:37,436 --> 00:00:39,391
>> MY FRIENDS,

9
00:00:39,391 --> 00:00:41,770
AND JUDAS.

10
00:00:44,569 --> 00:00:47,750
HEAR ME NOW FOR SOON I WILL LEAVE YOU

11
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:49,683
AND JOIN MY FATHER IN
HEAVEN.

12
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:52,518
>> WE CANNOT LOSE YOU, JESUS.
WE WILL PROTECT YOU.

13
00:00:52,518 --> 00:00:54,806
>> TLL NEVYO

14
00:00:54,806 --> 00:00:58,339
>> ALAS, ONE OF YOU ME.

15
00:00:58,339 --> 00:00:59,570
>> NO.

16
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:01,880
>> WHAT?

17
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:06,516
>> IT IS FORETOLD, AND THOUGH I
HAVE COMMITTED NO CRIME,

18
00:01:06,516 --> 00:01:12,106
I WILL
BE ARRESTED, TRIED, AND FOUND
GUILTY.

19
00:01:12,261 --> 00:01:15,094
>> SOUND FAMILIAR?

20
00:01:16,808 --> 00:01:18,912
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

21
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:23,612
A FAMOUS, WONDERFUL MAN ARRESTED
FOR NO REASON AT ALL.

22
00:01:23,872 --> 00:01:26,108
IF YOU HAVEN'T PUT IT TOGETHER, FOLKS,

23
00:01:26,108 --> 00:01:29,515
I'M COMPARING MYSELF TO
JESUS AGAIN.

24
00:01:29,515 --> 00:01:34,690
AND WHAT BETTER TIME THAN ON HIS
BIRTHDAY, EASTER?

25
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:37,882
AS WE SPEAK, I AM BEING
PERSECUTED

26
00:01:37,882 --> 00:01:40,890
ON A LEVEL THE LIKES
OF WHICH THE WORLD HAS NEVER SEEN,

27
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:45,104
EVEN WORSE THAN THE LATE,
GREAT JESUS.

28
00:01:45,198 --> 00:01:48,105
YOU KNOW, MANY PEOPLE ARE SAYING
WE'RE VERY SIMILAR.

29
00:01:48,105 --> 00:01:52,472
WE'RE BOTH VERY TALL, VERY POPULAR,

30
00:01:52,472 --> 00:01:56,540
AND BOTH FRANKLY WHITE
AMERICANS.

31
00:01:56,618 --> 00:01:59,672
YOU KNOW, JESUS DID SOME
INCREDIBLE THINGS.

32
00:01:59,768 --> 00:02:01,727
SOME WOULD CALL THEM MIRACLES.

33
00:02:01,809 --> 00:02:05,299
IN TERMS OF FISH AND WITH REGARD
TO BREAD.

34
00:02:05,299 --> 00:02:07,604
FISH AND BREAD.

35
00:02:07,604 --> 00:02:10,320
HE ROSE FROM THE DEAD ON THE
THIRD DAY.

36
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:13,019
I WOULD HAVE DONE IT FASTER,

37
00:02:13,019 --> 00:02:16,509
POSSIBLY TWO DAYS.
I THINK WE COULD HAVE DONE IT A
LOT FASTER.

38
00:02:16,509 --> 00:02:18,604
HE HAD A GOOD MIND FOR BUSINESS.

39
00:02:18,687 --> 00:02:21,519
WATER INTO WINE.
PURE PROFIT.

40
00:02:21,519 --> 00:02:24,443
AND HE HAD BIG, BIG RALLIES JUST LIKE ME,

41
00:02:24,443 --> 00:02:28,876
AND A LOT OF HIS
FOLLOWERS GOT IN BIG, BIG
TROUBLE, JUST LIKE MINE.

42
00:02:28,876 --> 00:02:33,521
ALL BECAUSE I TOLD THEM EXACTLY
WHAT JESUS WOULD HAVE SAID,

43
00:02:33,521 --> 00:02:37,549
GET
VERY VIOLENT AND START A WAR.

44
00:02:37,549 --> 00:02:41,299
AND I'VE EVEN GOT MY VERY OWN JUDAS,

45
00:02:41,299 --> 00:02:43,263
RAN DeSANTIS.

46
00:02:43,263 --> 00:02:46,661
RON DeSANTIS CAME TO ME, TEARS
IN HIS EYES, HE SAID,

47
00:02:46,661 --> 00:02:50,264
HELP ME,
MR. TRUMP.
I'M GOING TO LOSE MY ELECTION.

48
00:02:50,264 --> 00:02:54,333
SO I VERY GENEROUSLY PRETENDED TO LIKE HIM,

49
00:02:54,333 --> 00:02:57,148
AND THEN, HE DID A
JUDAS.

50
00:02:57,148 --> 00:03:02,087
AND NOW HE CAN'T EVEN GET THE
GAYS OUT OF DISNEY WORLD.

51
00:03:03,641 --> 00:03:06,195
LOOK AT THESE GUYS BACK HERE,
HUH?

52
00:03:06,195 --> 00:03:10,025
THEY JUST HAVE TO SIT HERE
FROZEN WHILE I TALK.
CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT?

53
00:03:10,928 --> 00:03:13,834
MR. JESUS, QUITE A GUY.

54
00:03:13,834 --> 00:03:17,354
BUT NOW PEOPLE ARE SAYING
PERHAPS I'M EVEN BETTER THAN JESUS

55
00:03:17,354 --> 00:03:21,621
BECAUSE I'M A SELF-MADE
BILLIONAIRE, AND CHRIST WAS --

56
00:03:21,727 --> 00:03:25,020
LET'S CALL IT WHAT IT IS -- A
NEPO BABY.
OKAY?

57
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:27,719
I MEAN, HIS DAD WAS GOD.

58
00:03:27,719 --> 00:03:32,347
IT'S PRETTY EASY TO START A
RELIGION WHEN YOUR DAD IS GOD.

59
00:03:32,432 --> 00:03:34,307
HE DID GOOD FRIDAY.

60
00:03:34,307 --> 00:03:37,754
I SAID, WHY NOT MAKE IT GREAT?
WE CAN MAKE IT GREAT.

61
00:03:37,754 --> 00:03:42,381
WITH ME, WE'LL BE DOING GREAT
FRIDAY, PERHAPS EVEN TGI-FRIDAYS

62
00:03:42,381 --> 00:03:45,616
WITH THE STUFF ON THE WALLS AND
EVERYTHING.

63
00:03:45,616 --> 00:03:48,832
BUT WE LOVE EASTER, WE LOVE
HIDING THE EGG.

64
00:03:48,925 --> 00:03:51,592
DON'T WE, FOLKS?
WE LOVE HIDING THE LITTLE EGGS.

65
00:03:51,592 --> 00:03:55,898
YOU KNOW I HAVE MANY BEAUTIFUL
EGGS FROM MY TIME AT THE WHITE HOUSE,

66
00:03:55,898 --> 00:04:00,719
AND NOW THE DEPARTMENT OF
JUSTICE ARE SAYING, WHERE ARE
THE EGGS?
WE NEED THE EGGS BACK.

67
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:06,331
BUT I HID THEM.
THEY'RE MY EGGS TO TAKE, OKAY?

68
00:04:06,331 --> 00:04:11,249
SO TOMORROW, I WILL EAT MY
EASTER HAMBURGER WITH MY FAMILY,

69
00:04:11,249 --> 00:04:13,876
OR HOPEFULLY NOT.

70
00:04:13,876 --> 00:04:18,346
AND THEN AFTER THAT, THEY WILL
COME FOR ME, LOCK ME AWAY.

71
00:04:18,348 --> 00:04:20,794
BECAUSE JUST LIKE JESUS, ALL I DID

72
00:04:20,794 --> 00:04:24,474
WAS BE FRIENDLY TO A SEX
WORKER, AND NOW THEY WANT TO PUT
ME IN JAIL.

73
00:04:24,474 --> 00:04:27,452
JUST AWFUL.

74
00:04:27,452 --> 00:04:31,227
BUT WHO KNOWS, FOLKS, MAYBE
PRISON WILL MAKE ME EVEN MORE
POPULAR.

75
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,846
LIKE THAT GUY BACK THERE,

76
00:04:32,846 --> 00:04:36,208
JESUS OF ASKABAN, THAT GUY.

77
00:04:36,208 --> 00:04:38,875
JESUS OF ASKABAN, HE'S CALLED.

78
00:04:38,875 --> 00:04:42,578
AND THAT IS THE STORY OF EASTER.

79
00:04:42,578 --> 00:04:44,487
HAPPY BIRTHDAY, JESUS.

80
00:04:44,487 --> 00:04:46,482
LOOK AT THE FINGERS.

81
00:04:46,482 --> 00:04:49,663
DIDN'T STOP DOING THE FINGERS
THE WHOLE TIME.

82
00:04:50,801 --> 00:04:53,811
WEIRD CHOICE WITH THE FINGERS.

83
00:04:56,464 --> 00:04:58,755
LOOK AT JESUS.

84
00:04:58,755 --> 00:05:02,979
SO HAPPY HANUKKAH TO ALL THE
PASSOVERS,

85
00:05:02,979 --> 00:05:08,473
AND ALL THE RAMADANS
DO.
WE LOVE TO SAY RAMADAN.

86
00:05:08,871 --> 00:05:13,184
BUT MOSTLY HAPPY EASTER BECAUSE
WE LIKE JESUS, RIGHT?

87
00:05:14,321 --> 00:05:17,617
STILL FROZEN WITH THE LITTLE
HANDS.

88
00:05:17,617 --> 00:05:20,053
THEY'RE NOT EVEN GOING TO GET TO
SAY THE BIG LINE.

89
00:05:20,144 --> 00:05:23,978
MAYBE IF YOU BREAK A BIG
POLITICAL CHARACTER, YOU CAN SAY
THE BIG LINE.

90
00:05:23,978 --> 00:05:28,660
I'M GOING TO DO IT BY MYSELF
RIGHT NOW.
SO HAPPY EASTER

91
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:32,674
AND LIVE FROM
NEW YORK, IT'S SATURDAY NIGHT!

LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, MOLLY
SHANNON!

00:08:10,315 --> 00:08:14,143
>>> THANK YOU.
THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU,
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

94
00:08:14,143 --> 00:08:18,807
OH, MY GOD.
IT'S SO GREAT TO BE BACK.

95
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:27,058
I'VE HAD SUCH A FUN YEAR.
MY DAUGHTER STELLA STARTED
COLLEGE.

96
00:08:27,058 --> 00:08:30,238
MY SON NOLAN'S ABOUT TO GRADUATE
HIGH SCHOOL.

97
00:08:30,238 --> 00:08:34,145
AND I WROTE A BOOK ABOUT MY LIFE
CALLED "HELLO MOLLY."

98
00:08:36,316 --> 00:08:40,827
AND YOU KNOW, IT'S INTERESTING
BECAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE SURPRISED BY

99
00:08:40,827 --> 00:08:44,444
HOW HONEST I WAS
ABOUT SOME OF THE HARD TIMES MY
FAMILY HAD.

100
00:08:44,444 --> 00:08:47,057
I MEAN, WE ALL HAVE PROBLEMS,
RIGHT?

101
00:08:47,057 --> 00:08:50,654
BUT MY DAD ALWAYS TAUGHT ME TO
KEEP MY CHIN UP

102
00:08:50,654 --> 00:08:53,855
AND NEVER GIVE
UP ON MY SHOW BIZ DREAMS.

103
00:08:53,855 --> 00:08:57,293
HE WOULD PLAY ME OLD CLASSIC
MUSICALS

104
00:08:57,388 --> 00:09:01,824
AND HE WOULD TELL ME,
YOU KNOW, MOLLY, NO MATTER WHAT
PROBLEMS YOU FACE,

105
00:09:01,824 --> 00:09:06,425
IF YOU KEEP A

00:12:37,023 --> 00:12:38,990
NOW, BEING A VALET IS THE

160
00:12:38,992 --> 00:12:40,892
HARDEST JOB IN THE WORLD.

161
00:12:40,894 --> 00:12:42,260
FORGOT ABOUT BRAIN SURGERY.

162
00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:43,561
IT'S THE SECOND HARDEST JOB IN

163
00:12:43,563 --> 00:12:45,196

BE A GREAT VALET, SO LONG AS YOU

00:12:51,438 --> 00:12:53,972
FOLLOW THESE THREE SIMPLE RULES.

171
00:12:53,974 --> 00:12:58,743
LIL JOKE, LIL BOW, LIL JOG.

172
00:12:58,745 --> 00:13:00,578

173
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:02,447
QUALITY VALET.

174
00:13:02,449 --> 00:13:03,848

191
00:13:31,778 --> 00:13:33,945
>> OH, A PORSCHE.

192
00:13:33,947 --> 00:13:36,114
COMPENSATING FOR SOMETHING?

193
00:13:36,116 --> 00:13:38,082

DON'T EVEN SAY IT.

201
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:58,069
I GAVE HIM BACK HIS KEYS.

202
00:13:58,071 --> 00:13:58,836
I'M SO SORRY.

203
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:00,605
>> THAT AND YOUR JOKE WAS ABOUT

204
00:14:00,607 --> 00:14:03,274
A CUSTOMER'S PENIS, AND YOU RAN

205
00:14:03,276 --> 00:14:04,175

00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:28,533
HERE YOU GO.

222
00:14:28,535 --> 00:14:28,800
UM.

223
00:14:28,802 --> 00:14:30,068
>> OH, THANK YOU SO MUCH.

224
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:32,937
>> NICE CAR YOU GOT THERE.

225
00:14:32,939 --> 00:14:35,573
I MAY HAVE TO FEEL THAT BABY.

226
00:14:35,575 --> 00:14:36,608
I'M JUST KIDDING.

227
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:37,842

228
00:14:37,844 --> 00:14:38,743

00:14:40,714 --> 00:14:41,045
NO.

00:14:41,047 --> 00:14:41,946
I'M NOT.

232
00:14:41,948 --> 00:14:44,082
I'M REALLY MARRIED, WE BROKE UP,

233
00:14:44,084 --> 00:14:44,515
THOUGH.

234
00:14:44,517 --> 00:14:47,252
I MET HIM ONLINE, AND TURNED OUT

235
00:14:47,254 --> 00:14:49,854
HE WAS A SICK MIDDLE SCHOOLER

236
00:14:49,856 --> 00:14:50,989
USING A HOSPITAL COMPUTER.

237
00:14:50,991 --> 00:14:52,023
>> OKAY, NO.

238
00:14:52,025 --> 00:14:53,124
BRING IT ON BACK.

239
00:14:53,126 --> 00:14:54,058

00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:54,525
YEAH.

GOOD TRY.

242
00:14:55,262 --> 00:14:57,428
BUT I ALMOST WISH YOU STOPPED

243
00:14:57,430 --> 00:15:00,398
AFTER THE FIRST THING YOU SAID.

244
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:00,698
>> OH.

245
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:01,766
WELL, HOW WAS THAT?

246
00:15:01,768 --> 00:15:02,400
>> NOT VERY GOOD.

247
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:03,901
>> I'LL DO IT NEXT TIME.

248
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:07,839
>> STANLEY, YOU WANT TO GIVE IT

249
00:15:07,841 --> 00:15:08,139
A TRY?

250
00:15:08,141 --> 00:15:09,274
>> OKEYDOKEY.

251
00:15:09,276 --> 00:15:10,108
>> THANK YOU.

252
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:13,177
>> YOU EVER COME HERE BEFORE?

253
00:15:13,179 --> 00:15:13,645
>> WHAT?

254
00:15:13,647 --> 00:15:15,046
I'M SORRY.

255
00:15:15,048 --> 00:15:15,813
I CAN'T REALLY HEAR WHAT YOU --

256
00:15:15,815 --> 00:15:20,718
>> PASS!

257
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,085
>> YIKES.

258
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:21,753
YOU WANT TO TELL US WHAT

259
00:15:21,755 --> 00:15:24,722
HAPPENED THERE, STANLEY?

260
00:15:24,724 --> 00:15:25,056
>> YES.

261
00:15:25,058 --> 00:15:26,758
I TALKED TOO QUIET, AND THEN I

262
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:27,659
SAID PASS REAL LOUD.

263
00:15:27,661 --> 00:15:29,627
>> THAT'S RIGHT, STANLEY.

264
00:15:29,629 --> 00:15:29,927
GOOD.

265
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:31,396
WE GOT ANOTHER CUSTOMER.

266
00:15:31,398 --> 00:15:32,964
>> CAN YOU LET ME TRY THE NEXT

267
00:15:32,966 --> 00:15:33,231
ONE?

268
00:15:33,233 --> 00:15:34,332
>> OKAY.

FINE.

270
00:15:34,701 --> 00:15:37,468
BUT TAKE IT SLOW, JENNY.

271
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:38,136

272
00:15:38,138 --> 00:15:39,003
>> CAREFUL.

273
00:15:39,005 --> 00:15:40,271
SHE'S GOT A TEMPER.

274
00:15:40,273 --> 00:15:41,039
>> OKAY.

275
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:42,106
ACTUALLY, ME TOO.

276
00:15:42,108 --> 00:15:43,474
I'M KIDDING.

277
00:15:43,476 --> 00:15:43,741
NO.

278
00:15:43,743 --> 00:15:45,710
ACTUALLY, I'M IN LOVE WITH YOU.

279
00:15:45,712 --> 00:15:47,578

THAT WASN'T RIGHT.

301

>> JEANNIE DARCY, SELECTIVE
STARTAGE.

326
00:17:25,392 --> 00:17:27,243
>> NO ONE BRINGS IT LIKE JEANNIE DARCY,

327
00:17:27,243 --> 00:17:29,460
AND THIS TIME THE
DARCINATOR IS LIVE,

328
00:17:29,554 --> 00:17:32,773
WHICH MEANS
YOU'RE HEARING HER JOKES AT THE
SAME TIME SHE'S TELLING THEM,

329
00:17:32,773 --> 00:17:35,539
INSTEAD OF STREAMING IT LATER,

330
00:17:35,539 --> 00:17:38,417
WHICH IS THE REASON MOST PEOPLE
GET NETFLIX.

331
00:17:38,417 --> 00:17:41,001
NO MERCY

332
00:17:41,001 --> 00:17:43,792
>> I HAD A BRA FITTING THE OTHER
DAY.

333
00:17:43,792 --> 00:17:47,295
I TRIED ONE ON AND HAD A FIT.

334
00:17:47,295 --> 00:17:49,994
MEN MUST DESIGN THESE THINGS.

335
00:17:49,994 --> 00:17:54,425
HAS ANYONE EVER SEEN A JOCK
STRAP WITH UNDERWIRE?

336
00:17:54,425 --> 00:17:58,679
AM I RIGHT, LADY FRIENDS?
YOU GET MY 411?

337
00:17:58,679 --> 00:18:02,137
DO NOT EVEN THINK OF GETTING ME
STARTED.

338
00:18:02,137 --> 00:18:04,276
>> JEANNIE DARCY IS A LEGEND.

339
00:18:04,276 --> 00:18:08,625
THAT GIRL INSPIRED A WHOLE
GENERATION OF LESBIAN COMEDIANS.

340
00:18:08,625 --> 00:18:09,929
>> SHE'S NOT A LESBIAN.

341
00:18:09,929 --> 00:18:11,573
>> SAY WHAT NOW?

342
00:18:11,787 --> 00:18:14,264

ALWAYS COMPLAINS HE MESSES UP
HER HOUSE AND JUMPS IN HER BED.

344
00:18:19,385 --> 00:18:22,578
I SAID, ARE YOU SURE IT'S A DOG,

345
00:18:22,649 --> 00:18:25,623
OR IS IT MY EX-HUSBAND?

346
00:18:25,623 --> 00:18:27,343
WHO'S WITH ME?

347
00:18:27,343 --> 00:18:31,761
DON'T GET ME STARTED.
DON'T EVEN GET ME STARTED.

348
00:18:31,761 --> 00:18:35,500

353
00:18:47,091 --> 00:18:49,205
DON'T GET ME STARTED.

354

357
00:19:29,084 --> 00:19:34,388
THAT IS SO NICE, JACKIE.

00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:36,657
>> WELL, I JUST THOUGHT MAYBE

359
00:19:36,659 --> 00:19:37,925
YOU COULD DO SUNDAY MORNING

360
00:19:37,927 --> 00:19:39,527
WAFFLES WITH YOUR LITTLE GIRL.

361
00:19:39,529 --> 00:19:41,495
>> THAT'S SO SWEET I COULD CRY.

362
00:19:41,497 --> 00:19:43,764
>> WE'RE JUST SO HAPPY FOR YOU,

363

SUSIE.

364
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:44,532
>> YEAH.

365
00:19:44,534 --> 00:19:46,400
AND WE'RE REALLY GOING TO MISS

366
00:19:46,402 --> 00:19:46,701
YOU.

367
00:19:46,703 --> 00:19:50,204
>> WELL, I'LL BE BACK IN A FEW

368
00:19:50,206 --> 00:19:50,972
MONTHS, UNLESS JIM FIRES ME.

369
00:19:50,974 --> 00:19:53,975
>> OH, COME ON NOW.

370
00:19:53,977 --> 00:19:54,875
I WOULDN'T DO THAT.

371
00:19:54,877 --> 00:19:56,143
THAT WOULD BE SUPER ILLEGAL.

372
00:19:56,145 --> 00:19:58,179
>> AND HEY, EVEN THOUGH I'M

373

>> I HOPE SO.

377
00:20:04,087 --> 00:20:07,722
AFTER ALL, I'M THE GOD FATHER.

378
00:20:07,724 --> 00:20:09,757
YOU GAVE ME AN OFFER I COULDN'T

379
00:20:09,759 --> 00:20:10,091
REFUSE.

380
00:20:10,093 --> 00:20:11,559
I'M STILL WORKING ON THE

>> CAN YOU T YOU, KENNEDY.

385
00:20:16,866 --> 00:20:18,532
HONESTLY, I'VE ACTUALLY NEVER

386
00:20:18,534 --> 00:20:18,966
FELTBETTER.

387
00:20:18,968 --> 00:20:22,169
MY NAILS ARE STRONG, MY SKIN

388
00:20:22,171 --> 00:20:22,570
LOOKS GREAT.

389
00:20:22,572 --> 00:20:23,537
I'M JUST GLOWING.

390
00:20:23,539 --> 00:20:24,972
THIS IS EVERYTHING I'VE EVER

>> WELL, I'LL LEAVE YOU GUYS

393
00:20:29,979 --> 00:20:31,979
WITH THIS SAYING I FOUND ON

394
00:20:31,981 --> 00:20:34,415
BRAINY QUOTE.COM THAT REALLY

395
00:20:34,417 --> 00:20:35,950
CAPTURES KIND OF THE WAY I'M

396
00:20:35,952 --> 00:20:37,151
FEELING RIGHT NOW.

397
00:20:37,153 --> 00:20:38,419
IT'S SO BEAUTIFUL.

398
00:20:38,421 --> 00:20:40,421
A MOTHER ALWAYS HAS TO THINK

399
00:20:40,423 --> 00:20:41,656
TWICE, ONCE FOR HERSELF, AND

400
00:20:41,658 --> 00:20:44,425
ONCE FOR HER CHILD.

401
00:20:44,427 --> 00:20:45,693
>> AWW.

402
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:48,095
>> THAT JUST ABSOLUTELY NAILS

403
00:20:48,097 --> 00:20:49,864
MATERNAL FEELINGS SURGING

404
00:20:49,866 --> 00:20:51,299
THROUGH MY BODY.

405
00:20:51,301 --> 00:20:52,033
ANYWAY, LET ME JUST GRAB THIS

HOW MANY FREAKING TIMES IS THIS

409
00:21:10,953 --> 00:21:13,654
GOING TO HAPPEN TO ME?

410
00:21:13,656 --> 00:21:16,490
>> UM, I'M SORRY.

411
00:21:16,492 --> 00:21:16,924
WAS THAT --

412
00:21:16,926 --> 00:21:20,161
>> A FART, YES, JIM, I RIPPED A

413
00:21:20,163 --> 00:21:20,928
BIG OLD FART.

414
00:21:20,930 --> 00:21:22,296
ARE YOU HAPPY?

415
00:21:22,298 --> 00:21:22,930
>> NO.

416
00:21:22,932 --> 00:21:25,833
I DEFINITELY WOULDN'T SAY HAPPY.

417
00:21:25,835 --> 00:21:27,735
>> SO IT WAS --

418
00:21:27,737 --> 00:21:33,140
>> NOT A BABY, JUST GAS, YEAH,

419
00:21:33,142 --> 00:21:34,108
KENNEDY, OBVIOUSLY.

420
00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:35,543
GUESS YOU CAN HAVE YOUR WAFFLE

421
00:21:35,545 --> 00:21:36,510
MAKER BACK.

422
00:21:36,512 --> 00:21:37,178
I CAN'T MAKE SUNDAY MORNING

423
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:39,513
WAFFLES FOR A FART.

424
00:21:39,515 --> 00:21:41,148
>> JUST KEEP IT.

425
00:21:41,150 --> 00:21:42,149
I'M TOO EMBARRASSED TO EXPLAIN

426
00:21:42,151 --> 00:21:44,552
WHY I'M RETURNING IT.

427
00:21:44,554 --> 00:21:46,854
>> DAMN IT.

428
00:21:46,856 --> 00:21:50,224
I'VE BEEN PLAYING MOZART TO A

429
00:21:50,226 --> 00:21:52,860
GAS BUBBLE FOR EIGHT FREAKING

430
00:21:52,862 --> 00:21:53,194
MONTHS.

431
00:21:53,196 --> 00:21:56,130
I'M SO STUPID.

432
00:21:56,132 --> 00:21:59,500
>> SMELLS LIKE MAYBE IT WAS

433
00:21:59,502 --> 00:21:59,967
TWINS.

434
00:21:59,969 --> 00:22:01,902
>> DIDN'T YOU GO TO A DOCTOR?

435
00:22:01,904 --> 00:22:04,739
>> WHAT KIND OF A DOCTOR,

436
00:22:04,741 --> 00:22:07,641
JACKIE, A FART DOCTOR?

437
00:22:07,643 --> 00:22:09,477
WELL, WHATEVER, AT LEAST I STILL

438
00:22:09,479 --> 00:22:11,479
GET SIX MONTHS MATERNITY LEAVE.

439
00:22:11,481 --> 00:22:13,514
>> YOU DEFINITELY DO NOT.

440
00:22:13,516 --> 00:22:15,483
YOU FORFEITED YOUR MATERNITY

441
00:22:15,485 --> 00:22:16,917
LEAVE WHEN YOU STUNK UP THE

442
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:17,251
OFFICE.

443
00:22:17,253 --> 00:22:21,122
>> SO, SUSIE, THIS HAS HAPPENED

444
00:22:21,124 --> 00:22:22,590
MORE THAN ONCE?

445
00:22:22,592 --> 00:22:23,724
FOUR TIMES?

446
00:22:23,726 --> 00:22:26,026
>> HOW IS THAT EVEN POSSIBLE,

447
00:22:26,028 --> 00:22:26,327
SUSIE?

448
00:22:26,329 --> 00:22:27,461
>> OH, MY GOD.

449
00:22:27,463 --> 00:22:28,095
>> WHAT?

450
00:22:28,097 --> 00:22:29,597
>> I JUST REMEMBERED SOMETHING.

451
00:22:29,599 --> 00:22:30,931
I FEEL SO BAD BECAUSE I ARE EM

452
00:22:30,933 --> 00:22:33,267
THIS MORNING ON THE BUS, AN OLD

453
00:22:33,269 --> 00:22:35,202
MAN GAVE ME HIS SEAT, AND THEN

454
00:22:35,204 --> 00:22:37,671
THE BUS HIT A BUMP, AND HE FELL

455
00:22:37,673 --> 00:22:39,407
DOWN IN THE AISLE, AND HE DIED.

456
00:22:39,409 --> 00:22:41,675
>> THAT WAS THIS MORNING?

457
00:22:41,677 --> 00:22:42,810
>> WHATEVER.

458
00:22:42,812 --> 00:22:43,778
WELL, THE GOOD NEWS IS I CAN

459
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:46,647
START DRINKING AGAIN.

460
00:22:46,649 --> 00:22:47,314
>> YOU DO KNOW YOU AT WORK,

461
00:22:47,316 --> 00:22:50,451
RIGHT?

462
00:22:50,453 --> 00:22:51,652
>> HEY, SUSIE.

463
00:22:51,654 --> 00:22:53,954
I GOT YOUR LUNCH ORDER FROM TH

464
00:22:53,956 --> 00:22:54,355
CAFETERIA.

465
00:22:54,357 --> 00:22:55,656
>> THANK YOU SO MUCH, EVAN.

466
00:22:55,658 --> 00:22:56,123
>> NO PROBLEM.

467
00:22:56,125 --> 00:22:56,924
>> WHAT DID YOU GET?

468
00:22:56,926 --> 00:22:58,492
>> OH, I GET THE SAME THING

469
00:22:58,494 --> 00:22:59,560
EVERY DAY.

470
00:22:59,562 --> 00:23:00,194
I GET CAT FISH SLIDERS.

471
00:23:00,196 --> 00:23:03,898
>> WOW.

472
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:04,732
>> MM.

473
00:23:04,734 --> 00:23:06,167
THIS IS REALLY HITTING THE SPOT

474
00:23:06,169 --> 00:23:07,234
IN A VERY UNBELIEVABLE WAY.

475
00:23:07,236 --> 00:23:13,407
MM.

476
00:23:13,409 --> 00:23:15,943
>> SUSIE, LOOK AT YOUR STOMACH.

477
00:23:15,945 --> 00:23:17,978
>> OH, MY GOD.

478
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:18,379
OH, MY GOD.

479
00:23:18,381 --> 00:23:21,482
IT'S A MIRACLE.

480
00:23:21,484 --> 00:23:21,882
>> NO.

481
00:23:21,884 --> 00:23:22,416
>> IT'S A MIRACLE.

482
00:23:22,418 --> 00:23:24,418

483
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:26,554

484
00:23:26,556 --> 00:23:29,290
EXCITING NEWS.

485
00:23:29,292 --> 00:23:32,059
I WANTED TO TELL YOU THAT I'M

486
00:23:32,061 --> 00:23:32,927
PREGNANT AGAIN.

487
00:23:32,929 --> 00:23:34,829
WELL, THERE'S NO NEED TO TAKE A

488
00:23:34,831 --> 00:23:35,396
PREGNANCY TEST.

489
00:23:35,398 --> 00:23:37,965

00:30:07,089 --> 00:30:07,387
>> NO.

652
00:30:07,389 --> 00:30:08,021
THAT'S OKAY.

653
00:30:08,023 --> 00:30:10,290
I KNOW ALL THOSE GUYS ANYWAY.

654
00:30:10,292 --> 00:30:10,624
>> WHAT?

655
00:30:10,626 --> 00:30:13,594
THE LAKERS?

656
00:30:13,596 --> 00:30:15,963
>> BUT THEN I FOUND OUT AN UGLY

657
00:30:15,965 --> 00:30:16,964
TRUTH ABOUT HIM.

658
00:30:16,966 --> 00:30:19,299
>> DOCTORS TOLD ME I HAVE A

659
00:30:19,301 --> 00:30:19,666
CONDITION.

660
00:30:19,668 --> 00:30:22,436
WHERE ANY TIME YOU CLIMAX IN THE

661
00:30:22,438 --> 00:30:24,404
FUTURE, IT WILL STILL BE BECAUSE

662
00:30:24,406 --> 00:30:25,105
OF ME.

663
00:30:25,107 --> 00:30:25,806
>> AND THEN, HE BROKE UP WITH

664
00:30:25,808 --> 00:30:32,479
ME.

665
00:30:32,481 --> 00:30:36,183
HE MOVED TO ANAHEIM TO PURSUE

666
00:30:36,185 --> 00:30:37,217
HIS DREAM OF RUNNING SOCIAL

667
00:30:37,219 --> 00:30:38,285
MEDIA FOR GRUB HUB.

668
00:30:38,287 --> 00:30:40,254
SO THE NEXT DAY, I WENT TO A

669
00:30:40,256 --> 00:30:42,890
BOWLING ALLY TO GET SLOPPY DRUNK

670
00:30:42,892 --> 00:30:54,701
WHEN -- SOME GUY APPROACHED ME.

671
00:30:54,703 --> 00:30:55,369
>> HELLO.

672
00:30:55,371 --> 00:30:57,771
I'M BRIAN.

673
00:30:57,773 --> 00:30:59,039
WOULD YOU LIKE TO GO OUT?

674
00:30:59,041 --> 00:31:01,141
>> UM, WHATEVER, I GUESS.

675
00:31:01,143 --> 00:31:05,846
>> OH, MY GOD.

676
00:31:05,848 --> 00:31:10,651
>> WELL, MY GIRLFRIEND, SOPHIE,

677
00:31:10,653 --> 00:31:12,019
A FANCY PLAY WRITE.

678
00:31:12,021 --> 00:31:13,120
I'M SO PROUD.

679
00:31:13,122 --> 00:31:15,155
HIGH FIVE.

680
00:31:15,157 --> 00:31:15,489
NOBODY?

681
00:31:15,491 --> 00:31:15,789
OKAY.

682
00:31:15,791 --> 00:31:18,525
>> AND AFTER FOUR WEEKS OF

683
00:31:18,527 --> 00:31:20,260
DATING, I COULDN'T HOLD HIM OFF

684
00:31:20,262 --> 00:31:20,794
ANYMORE.

685
00:31:20,796 --> 00:31:21,929
I HAD TO BUCK UP AND FINALLY

686
00:31:21,931 --> 00:31:26,233
HAVE SEX WITH HIM.

687
00:31:26,235 --> 00:31:27,034
>> WHOO!

688
00:31:27,036 --> 00:31:28,735
AS THEY SAY, THERE'S A FIRST

689
00:31:28,737 --> 00:31:30,037
TIME FOR EVERYTHING.

690
00:31:30,039 --> 00:31:32,139

691
00:31:32,141 --> 00:31:34,741

692
00:31:34,743 --> 00:31:35,075
MY LIFE.

693
00:31:35,077 --> 00:31:41,815
>> OKAY.

694
00:31:41,817 --> 00:31:44,785
>> AND THERE IT WAS, I HAD

695
00:31:44,787 --> 00:31:46,486
REACHED MY 1,000th MAN.

696
00:31:46,488 --> 00:31:49,423
IT WAS TIME TO OFFICIALLY SETTLE

697
00:31:49,425 --> 00:31:50,791
IN, UNTIL, I MET SOMEONE WHO

698
00:31:50,793 --> 00:31:53,727
WOULD CHANGE MY LIFE.

699
00:31:53,729 --> 00:31:55,429

OF THEIR JOURNALISTS

WHO WAS
ARRESTED ON ESPIONAGE CHARGES,

788

IDEA FOR A PRISONER SWAP.

FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS
ARRAIGNED ON TUESDAY,

790
00:36:01,277 --> 00:36:04,585
AND A
PHOTOGRAPHER RELEASED THIS PHOTO
OF TRUMP IN THE COURTROOM,

791
00:36:04,585 --> 00:36:08,722
AND I
DON'T LIKE THAT HE'S SLANKED BY
AN O.J. AMOUNT OF LAWYERS

792
00:36:08,722 --> 00:36:13,707
BECAUSE THAT TELLS ME HE'S
DEFINITELY GUILTY AND HE'S
DEFINITELY GETTING AWAY WITH IT.

DOESN'T THINK TRUMP IS GOING TO
GET A FAIR TRIAL IN MANHATTAN.

795
00:36:22,502 --> 00:36:27,493

SEEMS TO HATE HIM.

796
00:36:27,769 --> 00:36:31,531
I THOUGHT HE
LOOKED PERFECTLY NICE.
HE HAD BLENDED HIS FOUNDATION.

797
00:36:31,611 --> 00:36:33,396
HE HAD STAPLED DOWN HIS HAIR.

798
00:36:33,487 --> 00:36:37,514
BUT THE GUY STILL DREW HIM LIKE
THE MUD MONSTER FROM SCOOBY-DOO,

799
00:36:38,391 --> 00:36:42,368
>> AFTER HIS ARRAIGNMENT, DONALD
TRUMP SPOKE TO SUPPORTERS AT MAR-A-LAGO

800
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:46,390
AND SAID THERE WAS A
VERY DARK CLOUD OVER OUR BELOVED COUNTRY,

801
00:36:46,489 --> 00:36:49,711
WHICH IS ALSO WHAT HE
USED TO CALL OBAMA.

DONALD TRUMP'S INDICTMENT,

00:36:56,362 --> 00:36:58,650
HIS
DAUGHTER IVANKA HAS BEEN ABSENT,

804
00:36:58,650 --> 00:37:02,226
AND HIS OTHER DAUGHTER TIFFANY
IS TRYING TO TAKE HER PLACE BY HIS SIDE,

THEY SAID, THEY KNOW WHAT IT
LOOKED LIKE, BUT THEY WERE
ACTUALLY EXPELLED

823
00:38:19,418 --> 00:38:22,049

OH, MY GOD.

01:04:09,980 --> 01:04:12,047
I AM SO SORRY I EVER DOUBTED

YOU, SALLY.

1487
01:04:12,649 --> 01:04:14,115
I SEE IT NOW.

1488
01:04:14,117 --> 01:04:15,684
THEY ARE GOING TO PUT THE BOYS

1489
01:04:15,686 --> 01:04:19,854
ON STAGE IN PACKED STADIUMS

I'M 50 YEARS OLD.

1504

50.

1505
01:04:55,558 --> 01:05:00,095
OVERWHELMED.

1506
01:05:00,097 --> 01:05:01,429
SURE, TRUMP GOT INDICTED, BUT

1507
01:05:01,431 --> 01:05:02,664
NOW EVERYONE SAYS THE CASE

1508
01:05:02,666 --> 01:05:05,033
AGAINST HIM IS WEAK AND THAT

1509
01:05:05,035 --> 01:05:07,602
HE'LL NEVER SERVE ANY JAIL TIME.

1510
01:05:07,604 --> 01:05:09,237
AS SOMEONE WHOSE ENTIRE

1511

YOU NEED TO FEEL CALM AND

1514
01:05:13,910 --> 01:05:14,275
REASSURED.

1515
01:05:14,277 --> 01:05:20,548
YOU NEED THE NEWEST MEDITATION

>> HE'S THE FIRST AMERICAN

1522
01:05:27,357 --> 01:05:28,890
PRESIDENT TO EVER BE INDICTED.

1523
01:05:28,892 --> 01:05:31,993
THIS IS TRULY A HISTORIC AND

1524
01:05:31,995 --> 01:05:32,927
HUMILIATING MOMENT.

1525
01:05:32,929 --> 01:05:36,631
>> TRUMP IS A BRAD, DEFEATED

1526
01:05:36,633 --> 01:05:36,898
MAN.

1527
01:05:36,900 --> 01:05:38,199
THEY MADE HIM COME FROM FLORIDA

1528
01:05:38,201 --> 01:05:40,769
WHERE IT'S 80 DEGREES TO NEW

1529
01:05:40,771 --> 01:05:43,638
YORK WHERE IT'S ONLY 60 DEGREES.

1530
01:05:43,640 --> 01:05:46,274
HOW DEPRESSING.

1531
01:05:46,276 --> 01:05:48,676
>> HIS MOTOR CADE WASN'T THAT

1532
01:05:48,678 --> 01:05:48,977
BIG.

1533
01:05:48,979 --> 01:05:50,578
I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE BIGGER,

1534
01:05:50,580 --> 01:05:51,980
BUT IT WAS SO SMALL.

1535
01:05:51,982 --> 01:05:53,715
>> DONALD WAS ALL ALONE, NO

1536
01:05:53,717 --> 01:05:55,216
FAMILY OR FRIENDS TO SUPPORT

1537
01:05:55,218 --> 01:05:55,483
HIM.

1538
01:05:55,485 --> 01:05:57,252
I SHOULDN'T SAY THIS AS A

1539
01:05:57,254 --> 01:05:59,988
JOURNALIST, BUT THAT A LOSER.
