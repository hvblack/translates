1
00:00:01,762 --> 00:00:05,478
<i>Cheers is filmed
before a live studio audience.</i>

2
00:00:13,774 --> 00:00:17,043
Sam, I think Carla
has a drink order.

3
00:00:18,745 --> 00:00:21,818
Sweetheart,
are you all right?
- Sammy, I think this could be it.

4
00:00:21,818 --> 00:00:24,093
I think the twins are coming.

5
00:00:25,636 --> 00:00:28,611
What do you know?
The Sixers are
in town tonight.

6
00:00:28,611 --> 00:00:34,043
Isn't it amazing
how Carla's labor pains
always seem to coincide
with Celtic home games?

7
00:00:34,077 --> 00:00:37,563
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Wait a minute.

8
00:00:37,598 --> 00:00:42,726
Now, you think
that I would exploit
this beautiful thing
called motherhood

9
00:00:42,726 --> 00:00:46,355
just to go
to some stupid basketball game?

10
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:50,472
I'm insulted!

11
00:00:50,472 --> 00:00:52,360
Carla, I'm not falling
for it this time.

12
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:56,671
You can scream till you shatter
every glass in this bar,
but you're not going anywhere.

13
00:00:57,517 --> 00:01:00,736
Sweetheart,
you're just going
to have to give birth
right here in the bar.

14
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:02,538
Come on.
It won't be that bad.

15
00:01:02,573 --> 00:01:04,991
Remember, the last kid
you had here was no big deal.

16
00:01:05,025 --> 00:01:08,443
All you had to do
was a little
snip-snip
and a quick mop-up

17
00:01:08,478 --> 00:01:10,409
and you were right back
on your feet.

18
00:01:10,681 --> 00:01:12,164
Let me call you
a cab, Carla.

19
00:01:12,198 --> 00:01:14,350
It's all right.
I got one waiting.
Thank you.

20
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:17,613
Hey, uh, there
wouldn't happen
to be another seat
in the delivery room,
would there?

21
00:01:17,613 --> 00:01:20,228
No, no.
There are only seats
for me and Eddie, Sam.

22
00:01:20,228 --> 00:01:23,031
Maybe next... child.

23

Announcement! Announcement!

38
00:02:39,953 --> 00:02:43,008
I just got a phone call,
and if things work out,

39
00:02:43,008 --> 00:02:45,597
it might be
my ticket out of here.

40
00:02:50,747 --> 00:02:52,648
Don't you even want
to know what it's about?

41
00:02:52,683 --> 00:02:54,783
There's more?

42
00:02:54,817 --> 00:02:58,998
Yes. I have been asked
to organize a cocktail party

43
00:02:58,998 --> 00:03:02,609
for Mr. Daniel T. Collier.

44
00:03:02,609 --> 00:03:05,494
Ooh, Daniel T. Collier,
the lemon wafer king?

45
00:03:05,528 --> 00:03:07,512
No, no, that's Donald P. Cooper.

46
00:03:07,547 --> 00:03:09,170
Hey, I love
those lemon wafers.

47
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:11,851
You ever dip them in cocoa
and try to get them out
without breaking them?

48
00:03:11,851 --> 00:03:14,320
Yeah, yeah.
Do you know you can make
a mock apple pie with those?

49
00:03:14,354 --> 00:03:15,929
Excuse me.
Those are Ritz Crackers.

50
00:03:15,929 --> 00:03:18,710
Stop talking about wafers!

51
00:03:19,092 --> 00:03:22,249
This is Daniel T. Collier,
the chairman of the board,

52
00:03:22,249 --> 00:03:25,224
the chief executive officer
of Lillian.

53
00:03:26,133 --> 00:03:28,985
Sammy, don't you have,
like, the slightest bit of guilt

54
00:03:29,019 --> 00:03:32,221
selling this bar
to a corporation named Lillian?

55
00:03:32,573 --> 00:03:35,524
Well, we used to be called
Drax Chemical,
Dye and Munitions,

56
00:03:35,558 --> 00:03:39,473
but people had trouble
believing our motto:
"We care about people."

57
00:03:40,447 --> 00:03:42,273
Okay, I'm going
to need the best
of everything:

58
00:03:42,273 --> 00:03:44,449
the best food,
the best liquor.

59
00:03:44,484 --> 00:03:45,866
The best bartenders.

60
00:03:45,866 --> 00:03:47,750
You?

61
00:03:52,876 --> 00:03:55,279
Good one, Sam.

62
00:03:57,097 --> 00:03:58,929
Did I say something
funny here?

63
00:03:58,929 --> 00:04:03,267
Well, actually,
I didn't get it either.
I was just laughing
to be polite.

64
00:04:03,267 --> 00:04:08,173
But in my own defense,
I do get some things
that no one else does.

65
00:04:10,093 --> 00:04:12,511
¶ When there's a shine
on your shoes ¶

66
00:04:12,545 --> 00:04:15,234
¶ There's a melody
in your heart ¶

67
00:04:15,234 --> 00:04:20,058
Shiny shoes, huh?
¶ Shiny shoes, shiny shoes.

68
00:04:20,058 --> 00:04:23,606
Ah, gents, notice anything
different about me today?

69
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:26,871
Okay, I'll go out on a limb.
New shoes?

70
00:04:28,011 --> 00:04:32,623
Yes, siree, Normie.
And for a limited time only,
thanks to the US
Postal Service,

71
00:04:32,623 --> 00:04:36,986
you, too, can be saying
to your feet,
"Thanks for your support."

72
00:04:37,654 --> 00:04:42,257
Are we to deduce
from this, Cliff,
that you are now selling
mail-order shoes?

73
00:04:42,291 --> 00:04:46,561
I am not selling
shoes here, Doctor.
I'm selling dreams.

74
00:04:46,596 --> 00:04:52,371
Dreams of a little cobbler
in Missouri who pours his heart
into every sole.

75
00:04:52,586 --> 00:04:56,745
Actually, Cliff,
with a pair of
dark socks
those could look
halfway decent.

76
00:04:57,023 --> 00:04:59,675
- How much
are they, Cliff?
- $19.99.

77
00:04:59,709 --> 00:05:02,915
Well, what the heck?
For 20 bucks,
I'll give it a shot.

78
00:05:03,163 --> 00:05:05,986
All right,
order me a size 11.

79
00:05:05,986 --> 00:05:09,518
Normie, Normie, Normie,
these are not
your assembly line clodhoppers.

80
00:05:09,552 --> 00:05:11,901
These are precisely
machine-measured.

81
00:05:11,901 --> 00:05:12,872
How do I do it then?

82
00:05:12,906 --> 00:05:16,779
Just trace your tootsies
on a cocktail napkin
over here, fellas, all right?

83
00:05:18,144 --> 00:05:21,930
I'll tell you.
This brings back memories
of my dad when I was a kid.

84
00:05:21,965 --> 00:05:23,774
Did you all always
used to order
your shoes
through the mail?

85
00:05:23,774 --> 00:05:27,270
He was always getting taken
by some huckster.

86
00:05:28,713 --> 00:05:32,969
Sam,
if you were throwing
a party,
would you order Dom Perignon
or Cristal?

87
00:05:32,969 --> 00:05:36,008
- Cristal.
- Dom Perignon it is, then.

88
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:39,916
This is getting insulting.

89
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:42,523
You know, I don't think
that she respects us.

90
00:05:42,523 --> 00:05:46,938
What do you mean "us," Sam?
You're the one who goofed
up that champagne thing.

91
00:05:46,938 --> 00:05:50,359
Woody, come on, man.
We're a team.

92
00:05:50,393 --> 00:05:53,027
Is that the insulting part?

93
00:05:53,027 --> 00:05:56,175
This... the point is,
she doesn't think
that we're

94
00:05:56,175 --> 00:05:59,084
worthy
of hanging around
with her society friends.

95
00:05:59,119 --> 00:06:01,520
She thinks
we're nincompoops.

96
00:06:01,554 --> 00:06:03,622
Nincompoops?

97
00:06:03,656 --> 00:06:05,835
Let's go, Sam.
We're going
to talk to her.

98
00:06:05,835 --> 00:06:09,795
- What?
- Nobody calls Woody Boyd
a nincompoop.

99
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:12,039
Except my dad.

100
00:06:16,537 --> 00:06:19,321
Miss Howe,
with all due respect,

101
00:06:19,355 --> 00:06:22,470
that nincompoop crack
really hurt.

102
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:25,944
Woody, I didn't call you
a nincompoop.

103
00:06:25,978 --> 00:06:28,673
All right, then why
you won't let us tend
bar at your party?

104
00:06:28,673 --> 00:06:32,001
Is it because you think
we're incompetent?
You think we're
not smooth enough?

105
00:06:32,119 --> 00:06:34,653
You think we're uncouth?

106
00:06:34,687 --> 00:06:37,530
No, I need you here.

107
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:40,243
Oh, okay.
Let's go, Sam.

108
00:06:40,243 --> 00:06:43,516
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What are you doing?
Where are you going?

109
00:06:43,516 --> 00:06:45,392
Sam, now, look.
Really, why do you care?

110
00:06:45,392 --> 00:06:47,583
Why on Earth do you want
to work this party?

111
00:06:47,617 --> 00:06:51,087
All right, you know,
by not hiring us,
what you're doing is
you're telling the rest
of the world

112
00:06:51,121 --> 00:06:54,673
that Sam Malone is not fit
for the society of decent folks,

113
00:06:54,707 --> 00:06:56,503
that he's incompetent,
that he's a clod.

114
00:06:56,503 --> 00:06:59,484
- What about me, Sam?
- You, too, Woody.

115
00:06:59,837 --> 00:07:03,198
I'm going to tell you
something, lady.
We may not have come
out of Harvard.

116
00:07:03,232 --> 00:07:07,302
We may not belong
to a yacht club.
We may not have tended
bar at a polo tournament,

117
00:07:07,336 --> 00:07:12,942
but we know how
to do our job
and we do it with
dignity and class.

118
00:07:12,976 --> 00:07:15,012
You're right.

119
00:07:15,345 --> 00:07:18,811
I'm sorry. The job is yours.

120
00:07:36,132 --> 00:07:38,050
Lovely party, Rebecca.

121
00:07:38,084 --> 00:07:40,191
Why, thank you, Mr. Collier.

122
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:46,559
- Isn't this place
something, Sam?
- Ooh, yeah.

123
00:07:46,593 --> 00:07:50,775
I think it's even nicer
than Wheeler's Funeral
Parlor in Hanover.

124
00:07:51,264 --> 00:07:55,427
- Of course, that's not the most fun
place in town.
- Well, I'll bet not.

125
00:07:55,427 --> 00:07:58,506
That would be
Bob's Funeral Parlor.

126
00:07:59,405 --> 00:08:03,959
Oh, my God.
Woody, is it me
or is that woman gorgeous?

127
00:08:03,993 --> 00:08:07,742
You look nice, Sam,
but I'm going
to have to go
with the woman.

128
00:08:08,998 --> 00:08:10,799
Do me a favor here,
will ya, buddy?

129
00:08:10,833 --> 00:08:15,867
Hold down the fort here
while I pass that lady
a tray of smoked Sammy.

130
00:08:19,108 --> 00:08:22,411
- Great party, huh?
- Yes.

131
00:08:22,445 --> 00:08:25,252
I'll have
a Manhattan.

132
00:08:26,215 --> 00:08:29,284
What?
Oh, this.

133
00:08:29,319 --> 00:08:31,603
Well, you think
I'm a bartender, huh?

134
00:08:31,637 --> 00:08:34,839
What do you think you are?

135
00:08:34,874 --> 00:08:37,111
Well, to tell you
the truth,
I used to be a bartender,

136
00:08:37,111 --> 00:08:39,520
but now I'm an
eccentric millionaire.

137
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:44,066
I just dress like this
to remind myself
of my modest beginnings.

138
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:46,401
Back behind the bar.

139
00:08:46,436 --> 00:08:50,105
I pay her to say that.
It keeps me humble.

140
00:08:50,139 --> 00:08:51,822
Malone, now!

141
00:08:51,822 --> 00:08:54,656
Ooh, that was
a good one, huh?

142
00:08:55,789 --> 00:08:59,011
I'm going to have
to give her a raise, huh?

143
00:08:59,011 --> 00:09:00,966
Looking good.

144
00:09:01,801 --> 00:09:03,457
Woody, what are you doing?!

145
00:09:03,457 --> 00:09:06,876
That is not a trash can.
That is a work of art.

146
00:09:10,894 --> 00:09:13,529
Oh, my God.

147
00:09:13,563 --> 00:09:17,098
This is just what I need
is for Collier to see this.
He is a collector.

148
00:09:17,133 --> 00:09:19,938
Oh, hey, let's
calm down now.
Nobody's seen anything yet.

149
00:09:19,938 --> 00:09:21,997
Woody, take it in the kitchen
and clean it out.

150
00:09:21,997 --> 00:09:23,802
Sure, Sam.
Sorry, Miss Howe.

151
00:09:23,802 --> 00:09:27,176
- Woody, go.
Just go.
- I got you. I got you.

152
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:30,746
I tell you, Sam.
This is the last time
I'm going to throw
one of these fancy parties.

153
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:33,546
The next time one
of these hotshots wants...

154
00:09:39,389 --> 00:09:42,821
Don't worry, Ms. Howe.
It was only a tray of glasses.

155
00:09:44,210 --> 00:09:48,822
Thank God.
Let's not tempt fate, Woody.
I'll clean it myself.

156
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:53,447
They weren't great glasses,
Sam, and they were dirty.

157
00:09:59,525 --> 00:10:03,363
uh, the vase?

158
00:10:13,503 --> 00:10:16,323
It was there.
I was holding it.

159
00:10:16,323 --> 00:10:18,858
It was right in my hands,
and now it's gone.

160
00:10:18,893 --> 00:10:22,522
Maybe we can glue it
back together
and no one will ever know.

161
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:24,703
Forget that.

162
00:10:25,867 --> 00:10:27,747
Just calm down now.
Calm down.

163
00:10:27,747 --> 00:10:30,370
It was an accident.
I'm sure Mr. Collier
will understand.

164
00:10:30,404 --> 00:10:34,303
No, he won't.
This isn't the
first time
I've goofed up
at the company.

165
00:10:34,303 --> 00:10:39,188
I started out
as a junior executive
and I'm diligently working
my way down to the mailroom

166
00:10:39,188 --> 00:10:43,775
with a brief stopover
at that Siberia called Cheers.

167
00:10:43,775 --> 00:10:47,204
Shh-shh. Stop it.
Just calm down here.
Calm down.

168
00:10:47,238 --> 00:10:51,194
I know.
I'll just resign now,
move back to San Diego,

169
00:10:51,194 --> 00:10:54,443
join the Navy,
grow old and die.

170
00:10:57,147 --> 00:11:00,450
Boy, Sam,
I really feel
sorry for her.

171
00:11:00,484 --> 00:11:03,358
Never thought I'd say it,
but so do I.

172
00:11:03,917 --> 00:11:06,506
Look at this party
she threw together here,

173
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:10,305
and then that happens.
Poor kid.

174
00:11:11,461 --> 00:11:13,182
You think they'll
make me manager?

175
00:11:13,182 --> 00:11:15,039
Hey, yo, over here.

176
00:11:19,737 --> 00:11:23,015
You know, Woody,

177
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:25,175
I'm about to do
a decent thing here.

178
00:11:25,209 --> 00:11:27,960
- Get out.
- Yeah.

179
00:11:27,995 --> 00:11:29,877
I'm going to take
the fall for this.

180
00:11:29,877 --> 00:11:34,184
What the hell?
I'm a great bartender.
I can get a job anywhere I want.

181
00:11:34,218 --> 00:11:38,622
- Sam, that's the
second nicest thing
you've ever done.
- Well, thank you.

182
00:11:38,622 --> 00:11:42,957
- What's the nicest?
- When you let me
drive your Corvette.

183
00:11:42,957 --> 00:11:46,455
Right. Right, right.
That's good. That's good.

184
00:11:49,183 --> 00:11:51,684
Excuse me, young man.

185
00:11:51,719 --> 00:11:55,240
What happened to the vase
that was sitting there?
Somebody move it?

186
00:11:58,859 --> 00:12:01,127
Sir, I have a confession.

187
00:12:01,162 --> 00:12:05,105
My name is Woody Boyd,
and by accident,
I broke your vase.

188
00:12:05,105 --> 00:12:08,966
You...
you broke it?!

189
00:12:10,871 --> 00:12:15,287
Do you know how many years
I waited
to add that to my collection?

190
00:12:15,287 --> 00:12:19,829
- Do you realize
the significance of that piece?
- No, sir.

191
00:12:19,863 --> 00:12:22,715
And I also broke some glasses.

192
00:12:26,237 --> 00:12:29,814
No, Sam,
I can't let you do it.
It wouldn't be right if you...

193
00:12:31,682 --> 00:12:34,989
Uh, Mr. Collier, there's been
a terrible accident.

194
00:12:34,989 --> 00:12:40,166
Yes. This person just told me
how he destroyed
my vase.

195
00:12:40,201 --> 00:12:41,868
But Woody didn't do it.

196
00:12:41,902 --> 00:12:45,511
What she means
is I didn't do it
on purpose.
Yes, I know.

197
00:12:45,511 --> 00:12:49,896
The only thing that can match
my great disappointment
at losing the vase

198
00:12:49,896 --> 00:12:54,097
is the admiration
that I feel for this boy.

199
00:12:56,834 --> 00:12:59,969
Woody, you showed
great courage
and integrity

200
00:13:00,003 --> 00:13:02,392
in stepping up
to face the music here.

201
00:13:02,392 --> 00:13:05,969
Rebecca, would you mind
standing in for Woody
for a little while?

202
00:13:05,969 --> 00:13:08,994
You wouldn't mind,
would you?
I'd like to get
to know him better.

203
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:16,953
- You want a drink?
- Well, sure.

204
00:13:16,988 --> 00:13:19,211
Well, just tell
the girl.

205
00:13:20,742 --> 00:13:24,413
Miss Howe, I'll have a...
gin and tonic.

206
00:13:24,413 --> 00:13:26,788
Well, come on.
She'll bring 'em in.

207
00:13:39,764 --> 00:13:43,980
- Another Manhattan.
- Manhattan, huh?

208
00:13:44,015 --> 00:13:46,566
I own a lot of that, you know?

209
00:13:46,601 --> 00:13:49,219
Right, the eccentric millionaire
routine.

210
00:13:49,253 --> 00:13:50,886
You know, I got
to tell you the truth here.

211
00:13:50,921 --> 00:13:53,373
I'm getting kind of bored
serving all these stiffs drinks.

212
00:13:53,407 --> 00:13:55,808
What do you say
you and I go out
and spend some
of my money?

213
00:13:55,842 --> 00:13:58,106
What time does France
close anyway?

214
00:13:59,514 --> 00:14:02,460
I think they're
remodeling.

215
00:14:03,016 --> 00:14:04,651
Have any other
suggestions?

216
00:14:04,685 --> 00:14:09,022
Unfortunately, my mansion's
being painted
and my yacht's
in dry dock.

217
00:14:09,056 --> 00:14:11,257
Well, let me see...
Oh, I know it.
I know it.

218
00:14:11,291 --> 00:14:14,863
You know, my chauffeur's
got a little one-bedroom
apartment downtown.

219
00:14:14,863 --> 00:14:17,111
What do you say you
and I go slumming?

220
00:14:17,616 --> 00:14:21,217
Let me guess:
you're not really
rich at all, are you?

221
00:14:21,252 --> 00:14:22,862
Well, now,
define "rich."

222
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:25,044
I have my health.

223
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:29,711
I... uh, think I'll just
stick with the drink.

224
00:14:29,711 --> 00:14:34,236
Let me get this straight:
when you thought
that I was a millionaire,
you were ready to go out
with me,

225
00:14:34,236 --> 00:14:38,143
but now that I'm just
a healthy bartender,
you don't want to have
anything to do with me.

226
00:14:38,143 --> 00:14:40,914
I gotta tell you, lady,
that makes you
an incredibly shallow person.

227
00:14:40,914 --> 00:14:43,640
Do you actually think
this sort of approach
is going to work?

228
00:14:43,674 --> 00:14:48,083
Absolutely.
You see, I'm an incredibly
shallow person myself.

229
00:14:48,083 --> 00:14:52,736
Between the two of us,
we couldn't make
a decent wading pool.

230
00:14:52,736 --> 00:14:53,974
What do you say, huh?

231
00:14:53,974 --> 00:14:55,935
Don't I know you from somewhere?

232
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:59,172
Yeah, well,
you probably
caught me out
at Fenway, huh?

233
00:14:59,206 --> 00:15:03,919
Of course.
I bought a bag
of peanuts from you.

234
00:15:08,182 --> 00:15:11,917
Another round of brandies
for Butch and Sundance.

235
00:15:13,354 --> 00:15:15,655
They're really, uh,
hitting it off, huh?

236
00:15:15,689 --> 00:15:19,304
I should say so.
They're in there
singing school songs.

237
00:15:19,304 --> 00:15:24,565
If you hate Ivy
League fight songs,
wait till you hear one
from bartending school.

238
00:15:25,549 --> 00:15:29,109
- You're not taking this
very well, are you?
- What, that little
backstabber?

239
00:15:29,109 --> 00:15:33,005
Oh, now cut that out.
Woody took a big risk, you know.

240
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:37,226
You broke the vase and
he took the blame for it.
It didn't have
to turn out that way.

241
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:39,269
He just had your best
interest at heart.

242
00:15:39,269 --> 00:15:43,877
I know.
I could just hug him till
his tongue turns black.

243
00:15:49,623 --> 00:15:53,224
You know, I'm not convinced
you're a millionaire,

244
00:15:53,224 --> 00:15:57,196
but I am sold
on the eccentric part.

245
00:15:57,231 --> 00:15:58,615
Well, that's a start.

246
00:15:58,649 --> 00:16:01,429
And since
I'm not getting
any interesting
nibbles tonight anyway,

247
00:16:01,429 --> 00:16:04,503
I'm reconsidering
your offer.

248
00:16:04,538 --> 00:16:07,376
Nibbles are my specialty.

249
00:16:07,804 --> 00:16:11,410
Great.
Well, what time will
you be getting off?

250
00:16:20,292 --> 00:16:24,115
Oh, listen, I've got
to show you a trick shot.
Now you watch this.

251
00:16:24,115 --> 00:16:26,516
Got you again, Pinky!

252
00:16:26,911 --> 00:16:29,636
You can't do that!

253
00:16:30,547 --> 00:16:33,075
You seem to have something
in your eye, Woodhead.

254
00:16:33,128 --> 00:16:34,400
I'll get it for you.

255
00:16:34,434 --> 00:16:37,056
Oh, Pinky, stop!

256
00:16:37,056 --> 00:16:39,338
It's noogie time!

257
00:16:39,372 --> 00:16:42,599
Oh, no! No! No!
No, Woody!

258
00:16:42,599 --> 00:16:45,219
No! No more!

259
00:16:48,082 --> 00:16:51,033
I see our serving
wench is here.

260
00:16:51,802 --> 00:16:53,766
I mean, hello,
Miss Howe.

261
00:16:53,766 --> 00:16:56,138
Oh, Woody.

262
00:16:56,173 --> 00:16:59,384
I tell you, you have
no idea how hard it is

263
00:16:59,384 --> 00:17:03,279
to find young fellas
with your stuff
in this day and age.

264
00:17:03,313 --> 00:17:07,785
You ought to see
the buttoned-down brats
my granddaughter
drags home from college.

265
00:17:07,785 --> 00:17:13,039
She really
deserves someone
more solid, someone real.

266
00:17:14,141 --> 00:17:18,920
Someone with
a strong back
and a thick neck,
you know?

267
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:21,031
Someone like you, Woody.

268
00:17:21,031 --> 00:17:23,246
Thank you, sir. I couldn't.

269
00:17:23,246 --> 00:17:25,265
Yeah, I could.

270
00:17:28,476 --> 00:17:31,860
She's out in Vail right
now on a skiing holiday.

271
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:34,744
I'm going up
there tomorrow.

272
00:17:34,778 --> 00:17:37,765
Woody, why don't
you join me?

273
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:40,646
You mean that, Pinky?
You bet I do.

274
00:17:40,646 --> 00:17:43,185
Well, I don't know if Miss Howe
would be too happy...

275
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:44,904
Oh, she'll be thrilled.

276
00:17:44,904 --> 00:17:46,573
To my toes.

277
00:17:46,607 --> 00:17:51,428
See?
So, great, I'll
go tell Jamison
to arrange it
right now.

278
00:17:52,887 --> 00:17:57,091
Woody, where do you
get these things?!

279
00:17:58,752 --> 00:18:00,729
Go figure, Miss Howe.

280
00:18:00,729 --> 00:18:02,636
I mean, you break the vase,

281
00:18:02,636 --> 00:18:06,216
and I end up being
the big boss' buddy.

282
00:18:06,727 --> 00:18:08,594
Isn't life funny?

283
00:18:08,629 --> 00:18:12,901
Do you mean funny "ha-ha"
or funny "a living nightmare"?

284
00:18:14,685 --> 00:18:18,637
- Is something wrong, Miss Howe?
- Yes, something is wrong.

285
00:18:18,672 --> 00:18:20,490
I am the one who should
be playing pool.

286
00:18:20,524 --> 00:18:22,891
I'm the one who should
be smoking cigars
and drinking brandy.

287
00:18:22,926 --> 00:18:25,755
I'm the one who should
be going out with
his granddaughter.

288
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:29,265
You know what I mean.

289
00:18:29,299 --> 00:18:31,811
Well, I'm sorry, Miss Howe.
I was only trying to help.

290
00:18:31,811 --> 00:18:33,966
Okay, Woody, we're all set.

291
00:18:33,966 --> 00:18:37,180
I'll stop by the bar tomorrow
afternoon and pick you up.

292
00:18:37,708 --> 00:18:40,210
Pinky, I have a confession.

293
00:18:40,794 --> 00:18:43,913
I didn't break your vase.
Miss Howe did.

294
00:18:45,698 --> 00:18:48,649
Whew, glad I got that
off my chest.

295
00:18:50,103 --> 00:18:52,221
You broke my vase?

296
00:18:52,221 --> 00:18:55,408
Well, actually, yes.

297
00:18:55,442 --> 00:18:59,082
That's the most cowardly thing
I have ever heard.

298
00:18:59,613 --> 00:19:03,725
You'd let this fine young man
take the blame
for your clumsiness?

299
00:19:03,725 --> 00:19:05,534
I don't know,
Miss Howe.

300
00:19:05,569 --> 00:19:09,980
I'm going to have
to seriously reconsider
your future with
our organization.

301
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:11,660
Uh, Pinky, wait a minute here.

302
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:13,876
Uh, Miss Howe
is a very nice lady.

303
00:19:13,911 --> 00:19:15,946
Klutzy, sure, but...

304
00:19:15,946 --> 00:19:18,247
she has a heart of gold.

305
00:19:18,281 --> 00:19:21,693
Well... well, all right.

306
00:19:21,693 --> 00:19:25,501
Woody, if you'll vouch
for her, I'll give her
another chance,
I guess.

307
00:19:26,557 --> 00:19:28,126
Thanks, Pinky.

308
00:19:28,126 --> 00:19:31,335
Hey, by the way,
your barn door's open.

309
00:19:33,784 --> 00:19:35,854
Woody!

310
00:19:42,652 --> 00:19:46,845
Hey, everybody.
Look what the shoe fairy
left under my pillow.

311
00:19:47,478 --> 00:19:50,019
Okay, Fox and Hounds,
that's you, Pete.

312
00:19:50,019 --> 00:19:52,215
Uh, Hugh,
you had the Executives.

313
00:19:52,215 --> 00:19:56,046
Uh, Norm, you had
the Old Smoothies,
didn't you?

314
00:19:56,046 --> 00:19:58,271
Uh, let's see--
Frasier.
Would you give
those to Frasier?

315
00:19:58,305 --> 00:19:59,794
All right,
who had the, uh, Playboy?

316
00:19:59,794 --> 00:20:02,049
Who else?

317
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:08,803
Hold it. Hold it.
Wait a minute.

318
00:20:08,803 --> 00:20:11,953
You bought shoes from
Boston's fashion king,

319
00:20:11,953 --> 00:20:14,499
- Oh Leg the Weenie?
- Yeah.

320
00:20:14,499 --> 00:20:17,081
I can't leave you guys
alone for a minute.

321
00:20:17,146 --> 00:20:19,091
Hey, Cliff,
I got to hand it to you.

322
00:20:19,126 --> 00:20:21,394
- These are really comfortable.
- Eh, you bet ya.

323
00:20:21,428 --> 00:20:23,709
- What style are these?
- The Star Fighter.

324
00:20:23,709 --> 00:20:25,736
Yes.

325
00:20:26,038 --> 00:20:29,178
I was sorely tempted
to get the Coup de Villes,

326
00:20:29,178 --> 00:20:32,044
but, uh, I do love
tassels, so...

327
00:20:37,293 --> 00:20:40,017
Cliffie, mine squeak.

328
00:20:40,614 --> 00:20:44,710
Uh, after a few weeks
of constant wear,
it'll be all right.

329
00:20:48,919 --> 00:20:51,390
Make it stop.

330
00:20:51,425 --> 00:20:53,234
Normie, what's the big deal?

331
00:20:53,234 --> 00:20:56,695
I mean, squeaky shoes are only
a problem if you're a mugger.

332
00:20:58,018 --> 00:21:01,650
Cliff, mine are
a little squeaky, too.

333
00:21:04,952 --> 00:21:07,995
Mine are squeaking,
too, Cliff.

334
00:21:07,995 --> 00:21:10,348
In E Minor.

335
00:21:14,915 --> 00:21:18,905
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, stop!
Freeze, everybody.

336
00:21:19,870 --> 00:21:23,838
Back on your barstools
right now. Go on.

337
00:21:26,521 --> 00:21:28,305
Hurry up.

338
00:21:28,305 --> 00:21:30,446
Thank you.

339
00:21:36,887 --> 00:21:38,854
Miss Howe.

340
00:21:38,854 --> 00:21:42,716
May I see you for a moment?
Yes, sir.

341
00:21:42,716 --> 00:21:46,384
He's changed
his mind.
I'm doomed.

342
00:21:46,384 --> 00:21:48,461
hell.

343
00:21:48,461 --> 00:21:51,222
Compliment his tie.

344
00:21:52,102 --> 00:21:56,555
Last night at the party someone
broke an irreplaceable vase.

345
00:21:56,590 --> 00:21:59,512
That's a very nice tie.

346
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:01,844
Are you listening to me?

347
00:22:01,844 --> 00:22:05,846
We found the remains
in the trash.
Now, is it any
of your people?

348
00:22:05,846 --> 00:22:08,163
You mean you don't
know who broke it?

349
00:22:08,163 --> 00:22:12,238
Unfortunately, I had
a little too much to drink.
The whole evening's
rather foggy.

350
00:22:12,272 --> 00:22:14,761
And you mean you don't
remember anything,

351
00:22:14,761 --> 00:22:18,327
and you have no idea
who did it?

352
00:22:18,362 --> 00:22:22,513
No, but when I find out,
they're going to wish
they never crossed my path.

353
00:22:22,513 --> 00:22:25,905
'Cause I'll find
a way to make
their life
a living hell.

354
00:22:25,905 --> 00:22:29,818
I don't blame you.
And you know, when you
find out who did it, give me a call,

355
00:22:29,818 --> 00:22:31,790
because
I'd like to give them
a piece of my mind.

356
00:22:31,824 --> 00:22:34,342
- Guess who, Pinky?!
- Woody! Woody!

357
00:22:36,663 --> 00:22:39,443
What in God's name
do you think you're doing?

358
00:22:39,443 --> 00:22:42,199
Oh, I'll show you
what I'm doing. Ah!

359
00:22:42,628 --> 00:22:44,770
Noogie!

360
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:49,125
- Who is this madman?
- This is Woody Boyd.

361
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:54,222
Woody,
last night, a very
valuable vase
was broken
at Mr. Collier's.

362
00:22:54,222 --> 00:22:57,516
But he doesn't remember
who did it.

363
00:22:57,516 --> 00:22:59,759
Of course he knows
who did it. It was...

364
00:22:59,759 --> 00:23:02,521
Fire! Fire!

365
00:23:02,907 --> 00:23:04,707
What fire?

366
00:23:04,741 --> 00:23:08,736
Now wait. Hold it!
Now hold it.
There is no fire.

367
00:23:08,736 --> 00:23:12,739
She didn't say "fire."
Uh, she said "flyer."

368
00:23:12,739 --> 00:23:16,796
Yes, yes, I thought I saw
Amelia Earhart up there.

369
00:23:16,796 --> 00:23:20,713
Great, uh,
nice save, Rebecca.

370
00:23:25,878 --> 00:23:30,032
What in God's name
is going on here?

371
00:23:30,066 --> 00:23:34,361
Well, it's the, uh...
Squeaky Shoe Club.

372
00:23:34,361 --> 00:23:37,289
Look, I intend to get
to the bottom of this.

373
00:23:37,323 --> 00:23:40,625
Now Miss Howe, you were in
charge of that party last night.

374
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:44,271
Do you or do you not know
who broke my vase?

375
00:23:44,271 --> 00:23:48,150
Of course she does.
- I certainly do.
It's time the truth
came out.

376
00:23:48,185 --> 00:23:49,701
It was...
Me.

377
00:23:49,766 --> 00:23:52,790
- No, Sam.
- Yes, Rebecca.

378
00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:54,373
I want to do this.

379
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:56,411
You, huh?

380
00:23:56,643 --> 00:23:58,664
Sir...

381
00:23:58,664 --> 00:24:01,536
you have grit.

382
00:24:07,754 --> 00:24:10,810
You don't ski by any chance,
do you?

383
00:24:10,811 --> 00:24:30,811
translate
