1
00:00:01,218 --> 00:00:03,414
Well, good morning.

2
00:00:03,414 --> 00:00:06,462
And can I just say thank you for last night.

3
00:00:06,462 --> 00:00:08,996
In the words of Hosier, you took me to church.

4
00:00:08,996 --> 00:00:11,992
- Oh, it was mutual, baby.
- Yeah, 

5
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:16,749
you wouldn't know by looking at your naked body.

6
00:00:16,749 --> 00:00:19,622
But you are an incredible lover, dear.

7
00:00:19,712 --> 00:00:23,689
Married for 3 years, but last night may have been our most perfect.

8
00:00:23,689 --> 00:00:25,902
Well, almost perfect.

9
00:00:25,902 --> 00:00:29,738
I still can't believe Benny accidentally walked in the door.

10
00:00:29,738 --> 00:00:32,673
Oh, it's fine.
Benny was asleep.

11
00:00:32,673 --> 00:00:35,068
I just really want to be a good stepmom.

12
00:00:35,068 --> 00:00:38,639
- You sure he didn't see anything? 
- I'm positive.

13
00:00:38,648 --> 00:00:42,679
Well, speak of the devil.
Morning, Benny.

14
00:00:49,113 --> 00:00:51,943
Hello, father.

15
00:00:51,943 --> 00:00:55,427
How you doing, sweetie? What you want for breakfast? 

16
00:00:55,427 --> 00:00:59,059
Could I have a bowl of nothing?

17
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:01,495
For some strange reason,

18
00:01:01,495 --> 00:01:05,346
I've lost my appetite forever.

19
00:01:05,346 --> 00:01:08,606
Under the weather, huh? Well, have some OJ.

20
00:01:08,606 --> 00:01:11,518
That vitamin C will get you back on top.

21
00:01:11,518 --> 00:01:16,128
On top.
On top.
On top.

22
00:01:16,128 --> 00:01:18,292
I can get on top.

23
00:01:18,292 --> 00:01:20,342
The girl can go on top?

24
00:01:20,342 --> 00:01:25,391
To quote Mario, here we go.

25
00:01:25,937 --> 00:01:30,100
I'm going to go take a shower now.

26
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:34,370
Are you sure, Benny? 
You've already taken three showers in the middle of the night.

27
00:01:34,370 --> 00:01:39,517
Yes.
And yet I still feel so unclean.

28
00:01:39,517 --> 00:01:43,757
Hey, uh, anyone want a smoothie? I'll take one.

29
00:01:43,757 --> 00:01:47,744
Hey, do me a favor and throw that little weird banana in there.

30
00:01:47,744 --> 00:01:53,786
Throw that weird little banana in there.
Throw that weird little banana in there.

31
00:01:53,786 --> 00:01:56,169
Are you sure? I don't want to hurt you.

32
00:01:56,169 --> 00:01:58,480
That thing ain't hurting nobody, baby.

33
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:01,625
Never has, never will.

34
00:02:01,625 --> 00:02:04,842
Hey, uh, Benny, shouldn't you be getting ready for school? 

35
00:02:04,842 --> 00:02:09,151
School? What need have I for school 

36
00:02:09,151 --> 00:02:13,231
when I have nothing left to learn? 

37
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:17,524
I'm telling you, honey, something's definitely off with Benny today.

38
00:02:17,524 --> 00:02:20,877
Oh, listen, honey.
Neither of our kids saw us having sex.

39
00:02:20,877 --> 00:02:24,645
Speaking of, uh Oh, hey, Eric.
Morning, bud.

40
00:02:26,969 --> 00:02:28,638
Hey, 

41
00:02:28,638 --> 00:02:30,720
honey.
What are you doing with that toaster?

42
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:35,060
Taking a bath.
Goodbye.

43
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:37,530
See, both our kids are completely fine.

44
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:39,880
If anyone saw something, it would have been the dog.

45
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:42,262
And he's as normal as ever.

46
00:02:44,652 --> 00:02:46,333
He looks shell shocked.

47
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:49,707
Well, he always does.
That's just that doggy style.

48
00:02:49,707 --> 00:02:53,386
Doggy style.
Doggy style.

49
00:02:53,386 --> 00:02:57,264
Doggy style is normally performed with the man behind, right? 

50
00:02:57,264 --> 00:03:01,431
- So, you want to switch places?
- Well, I didn't say that.

51
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:04,825
Here we go.

52
00:03:04,825 --> 00:03:06,189
Oh, Benny's back.

53
00:03:06,189 --> 00:03:08,103
Hey, Benny, did you change your clothes?

54
00:03:08,103 --> 00:03:13,206
Yes.
I've decided to commit my life to God.

55
00:03:13,206 --> 00:03:15,575
Are you sure you don't want any breakfast, honey? 

56
00:03:15,575 --> 00:03:18,985
Yeah. Your mom's done with her toast.
Uh, have her piece.

57
00:03:18,985 --> 00:03:24,312
Have herpes.
Have herpes.
Have herpes.

58
00:03:24,312 --> 00:03:27,965
It might be strange to disclose this 3 years into our marriage, 

59
00:03:27,965 --> 00:03:33,345
but I have a herpes.

60
00:03:33,345 --> 00:03:37,959
Never mind.
There is no God.

61
00:03:37,959 --> 00:03:41,530
Oh no, I just realized our blinds were open all night.

62
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:43,159
Do you think Neil saw us? 

63
00:03:43,159 --> 00:03:45,464
Oh, our our neighbor Neil Degrass Tyson.

64
00:03:45,464 --> 00:03:49,597
No, he's always too busy looking into that telescope of his.

65
00:03:49,597 --> 00:03:52,104
Oh, I wonder who that could be.

66
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:59,326
Oh, hi, Neil.
Oh, hello.

67
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:03,818
I just wanted to give you my trusty telescope.

68
00:04:03,818 --> 00:04:05,814
I won't be needing this anymore.

69
00:04:05,814 --> 00:04:07,667
Oh, yeah.
Why not, Neil?

70
00:04:07,667 --> 00:04:11,563
Let's just say that I was gazing into it last night and I caught a glimpse of Uranus.

71
00:04:11,563 --> 00:04:17,101
And in addition to the planet, I also saw both of your bee holes.

72
00:04:17,101 --> 00:04:19,697
Good day.

73
00:04:20,878 --> 00:04:24,034
Oh, honey, what a strange, weird person.

74
00:04:24,034 --> 00:04:27,869
Yeah, it really was a night to remember

75
00:04:27,869 --> 00:04:33,297
and one I wish I could forget.
