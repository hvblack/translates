1
00:00:05,589 --> 00:00:08,603
CHARLIE:
Did you ever see
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles?
FRANK:
No.

2
00:00:08,603 --> 00:00:11,808
The cartoon was excellent,
and the movies
were even, like,
more well-refined.

3
00:00:11,808 --> 00:00:13,294
Look at the price
of these suckers.

4
00:00:13,294 --> 00:00:14,959
-CHARLIE: Never saw it?
What are you guys looking at?

5
00:00:14,959 --> 00:00:18,209
Oh, uh, new couches.
We got rid of the old one,
but the prices are insane.

6
00:00:18,209 --> 00:00:21,000
Yeah, it's nuts, man.
I think we should just rent like
we did the last time, you know?

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,234
- Wait, you rented your sofa?
- Yeah, I mean, all we did
was pay the interest.

8
00:00:24,234 --> 00:00:27,477
- How much was the interest?
- Oh, it was nothing.
It was like 25 bucks a week.

9
00:00:27,541 --> 00:00:31,217
-How long did you have it?
-15 years, bro.
-About 15 years, yeah.

10
00:00:31,217 --> 00:00:34,818
You spent close to $20,000
on a couch you never owned.

11
00:00:34,818 --> 00:00:36,498
-$20,000...
-No.

12
00:00:36,498 --> 00:00:37,650
-Where are you getting
that from?
-No.

13
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:40,190
52 weeks a year, $25 a week.

14
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:45,336
15 years.
$19,500.

15
00:00:45,336 --> 00:00:48,112
- That seems high.
- That's pretty
bad business, fellas.

16
00:00:48,112 --> 00:00:51,092
I don't understand why prices
are so high right now.

17
00:00:51,092 --> 00:00:52,831
-Inflation.
-Yeah.

18
00:00:52,831 --> 00:00:56,206
-Right, yeah.
-Oh, well, right.

19
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:57,315
-Inflation, yeah.
-I mean, because of
the inflation.

20
00:00:57,315 --> 00:00:59,693
You guys do understand
what inflation is, right?

21
00:00:59,693 --> 00:01:03,266
Inflation?
Yeah, yes, absolutely.
For the sake
of argument...

22
00:01:03,339 --> 00:01:04,600
-Yeah.
-...pretend we don't.

23
00:01:04,677 --> 00:01:08,554
Inflation is when the price
of goods and services go up.

24
00:01:10,941 --> 00:01:12,605
Frank, oh, thank God.

25
00:01:12,605 --> 00:01:16,343
Hey, I'm being evicted.
The-the landlord,
he jacked up my rent
and I can't pay.

26
00:01:16,343 --> 00:01:19,652
Now, listen, I have glued
my hand to the door,
so they can't
physically remove me...

27
00:01:19,652 --> 00:01:21,966
Just a second, Deandra.

28
00:01:21,966 --> 00:01:26,075
See, inflation happens when
there's more demand
than there is supply.

29
00:01:26,075 --> 00:01:28,725
CHARLIE: Frank, I don't think
they're get...
You want me to, you want me
to walk 'em through it?

30
00:01:28,725 --> 00:01:30,926
-Charlie.
- Yeah, you shut up, Charlie.
You don't understand any of it.

31
00:01:30,926 --> 00:01:34,325
That's not true. Dude, I've
learned a lot about business
living with Frank.
You know, I know stuff.

32
00:01:34,325 --> 00:01:38,399
Also, speaking of,
I got an investment idea
that I'd love
to pitch you guys if I...

33
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,551
- Paddy's.
- DEE:
Do not hang up on...

34
00:01:40,551 --> 00:01:42,992
Charlie, we don't want to
hear it. Frank, keep going.

35
00:01:42,992 --> 00:01:46,623
Well, you see, the government
tries to curb inflation
by raising interest rates,

36
00:01:46,623 --> 00:01:49,066
so that people borrow less
and spend less.

37
00:01:49,066 --> 00:01:52,101
Okay, so if prices are
going up, can we get a raise?

38
00:01:52,101 --> 00:01:55,273
-No, well, you see,
if I raise your wages,
-then you'd have more money.

39
00:01:55,273 --> 00:01:57,903
And that, in this case,
is not good.
-CHARLIE: No.

40
00:01:57,903 --> 00:02:00,350
You know, it would
increase inflation.

41
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:02,583
And we don't want that
to increase, right?

42
00:02:02,583 --> 00:02:06,118
So maybe what we would
need to do is lower
our wages. I get it.

43
00:02:06,118 --> 00:02:08,254
But that would
cause a recession.
Yeah.

44
00:02:08,254 --> 00:02:10,262
Which could lead
to a depression.

45
00:02:10,262 --> 00:02:11,997
-So you can't.
-You can't do that.

46
00:02:11,997 --> 00:02:14,227
-MAC: Which we can't,
of course...
...take a pay cut.

47
00:02:14,227 --> 00:02:16,868
-Or a raise.
-Mm-mm, mm-mm.
-Mm-mm, no.

48
00:02:16,937 --> 00:02:19,542
- That's money talk.
- Yeah, that's money
talk right there.

49
00:02:19,542 --> 00:02:21,443
Basically, it boils down
to your nut, right?

50
00:02:21,443 --> 00:02:24,025
Like, how much, like, nut do
you go through a month, right?

51
00:02:24,025 --> 00:02:26,133
-Are you storing up your nut or
are you just blowing through it?

52
00:02:26,133 --> 00:02:29,154
-Like, okay, um, how much nut
do you guys blow through
in a month?

53
00:02:29,227 --> 00:02:31,157
-A ton.
-I don't want to talk
to you about...

54
00:02:31,157 --> 00:02:33,072
Yeah, I figured you were, man.

55
00:02:33,072 --> 00:02:35,933
-So, you got, you got to try to
hang on to some of that nut.
Otherwise it's all gone.

56
00:02:35,933 --> 00:02:39,362
But that's the screwy
thing about it.
Money isn't as valuable
as it always was...

57
00:02:39,362 --> 00:02:41,032
And money's not
as valuable, right?

58
00:02:41,032 --> 00:02:44,323
How can the value
of money be different?
Money is money.

59
00:02:44,323 --> 00:02:48,307
-No, a buck is not worth a buck.
No, no, it's worth
25 cents right now.

60
00:02:48,307 --> 00:02:50,146
-A dollar is worth 25 cents?
-Yeah.

61
00:02:50,146 --> 00:02:53,782
- Yeah, but I'll give you
50 cents for a buck.
- Hey.

62
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:58,572
Uh, I think that sounds
like a good deal.

63
00:03:00,567 --> 00:03:04,514
Frank, you got to wire me money!
They, they're unscrewing my...

64
00:03:04,514 --> 00:03:06,974
Okay, you know what?
I only have a ten.
I'll give you a five.

65
00:03:06,974 --> 00:03:10,685
- That's money talk. Let's go.
-Nice, nice, yeah.

66
00:03:10,685 --> 00:03:12,635
-Deal.
-Deal.

67
00:03:36,714 --> 00:03:39,312
Uh, Mac, you know, I'm-I'm
crunching the numbers over

68
00:03:39,312 --> 00:03:42,016
and I'm-I'm getting a little
concerned about our nut.

69
00:03:42,016 --> 00:03:45,995
How much money are you spending
on these Dwayne Johnson
energy drinks?

70
00:03:45,995 --> 00:03:48,675
MAC: Quite a bit.
I basically live on them now.

71
00:03:48,675 --> 00:03:50,245
Maybe you could
cut back a little bit.

72
00:03:50,245 --> 00:03:53,263
I mean, you don't
have to buy everything
The Rock tries
to sell you, you know.

73
00:03:53,263 --> 00:03:55,155
Interesting. What am
I looking at here?

74
00:03:55,155 --> 00:03:58,193
Come. Have a seat.

75
00:04:00,412 --> 00:04:03,295
Oh, shit.
An inflatable couch?

76
00:04:03,295 --> 00:04:04,971
-Yeah.
It was super cheap, dude.

77
00:04:04,971 --> 00:04:07,877
Now, this is just
a temporary option
until we make enough nut

78
00:04:07,877 --> 00:04:10,229
for us to afford
an actual couch.

79
00:04:10,229 --> 00:04:13,573
But it will
lower our monthly nut
because we're not
renting this bad boy.

80
00:04:13,573 --> 00:04:15,206
Dennis, we own it.

81
00:04:15,206 --> 00:04:18,581
-Oh.
-And speaking of nuts,
I also purchased these.

82
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:21,597
- Okay, went, went real literal
with it, didn't you?
- Yeah, yeah.

83
00:04:21,597 --> 00:04:23,533
-Fancy Nuts.
-These are very fancy.

84
00:04:23,533 --> 00:04:26,091
-Are they? Three dollars?
-Yeah, yeah,
only-only three dollars.

85
00:04:26,091 --> 00:04:28,624
Now, we could live on
these bad boys for weeks.

86
00:04:28,624 --> 00:04:31,182
Mm-hmm. Well, listen,
I don't really have any interest

87
00:04:31,182 --> 00:04:34,411
in your, uh, bulk tin
of low-end economy nuts,

88
00:04:34,411 --> 00:04:38,774
but I am finding this couch idea
to be pretty interesting,

89
00:04:38,774 --> 00:04:42,569
and it's giving me another idea
of how we could possibly

90
00:04:42,569 --> 00:04:44,614
"inflate" things
a little further.

91
00:04:44,614 --> 00:04:48,337
Oh, well, you can't
inflate this any further
'cause it'll pop.

92
00:04:48,337 --> 00:04:49,245
Just a figure of speech.

93
00:04:49,319 --> 00:04:52,425
No, trust me, I-I tried.
I-I already popped two
of them earlier today.

94
00:04:52,425 --> 00:04:53,734
-Did you?
-Yeah.

95
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:57,445
-Okay.
-I just kept blowing
and blowing and blowing,
and just... boom.

96
00:04:57,530 --> 00:04:59,419
Okay, all right,
well, that's okay.

97
00:04:59,419 --> 00:05:02,557
- You really shouldn't,
it's dangerous.
-I understand
what you're saying.

98
00:05:02,557 --> 00:05:03,755
I'm serious, Dennis.
Don't blow this up...

99
00:05:03,755 --> 00:05:06,767
I'm not going to do it.
I get what you're saying.
It's very clear.

100
00:05:06,767 --> 00:05:08,766
Okay.

101
00:05:12,294 --> 00:05:16,227
Charlie.
Check this out, a new lamp.

102
00:05:16,227 --> 00:05:18,255
-It looks like an old lamp,
but listen...
-It's a new lamp.

103
00:05:18,255 --> 00:05:21,501
-What's with the lamps, man?
You keep coming back
with all this junk.
That's like the fifth lamp
you've brought back.

104
00:05:21,501 --> 00:05:26,295
-Don't worry about it.
Where you want to put it?
-I don't know, stick it in
the storage closet or something.

105
00:05:26,295 --> 00:05:29,707
Frank, can I talk
to you a second
about this
investment idea I got?
Like, 'cause this is...

106
00:05:29,707 --> 00:05:33,797
-Oh, whoa.
Ah, this...
this place is packed.
- Right, yeah. Don't make a mess.

107
00:05:33,797 --> 00:05:37,502
Like, listen, Frank,
this could be, like, huge, man,
because I've been
tracking this thing.

108
00:05:37,502 --> 00:05:40,317
It's this, like, like, Internet
money kind of situation, right?

109
00:05:40,317 --> 00:05:42,921
Wha-What, crypto?
I'm not into crypto.

110
00:05:42,921 --> 00:05:45,712
Well, it'd be a lot less cryptic
if I could show you the video.
There's a video...

111
00:05:45,712 --> 00:05:49,065
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait. What-What's this?

112
00:05:49,065 --> 00:05:50,821
Is that a toilet?

113
00:05:52,498 --> 00:05:53,251
Uh... yeah.

114
00:05:53,251 --> 00:05:55,750
You mean to tell me we've been
living here all this time,

115
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:58,447
and you never told me
we had a bathroom?

116
00:05:58,447 --> 00:06:02,288
It's really, like, noisy.
It runs all the time.
It's not a good one.

117
00:06:02,288 --> 00:06:04,148
We piss in cans, Charlie.

118
00:06:04,148 --> 00:06:07,071
You can always go
number two down the hall,
and, like, it's a good system.

119
00:06:07,071 --> 00:06:09,563
- What else are you
hiding from me?
- Nothing,

120
00:06:09,563 --> 00:06:11,670
 Frank.
I'm trying to talk
to you about business.

121
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:14,377
- What's behind that door?
- That's the neighbor's door.

122
00:06:14,377 --> 00:06:16,766
-Hold this. Hold this lamp.
-Stop, Frank.

123
00:06:16,766 --> 00:06:19,588
Listen, man,
I don't want to have to be
constantly cleaning
toilets... 

124
00:06:19,588 --> 00:06:21,869
-Holy shit.
-Yeah, yeah.

125
00:06:21,869 --> 00:06:24,772
What the fuck is this?
-Yeah, okay.

126
00:06:24,772 --> 00:06:27,904
-Is this a bedroom?
- Um, I mean...

127
00:06:27,904 --> 00:06:32,273
Charlie, you mean
we've been living
in a two-bedroom
with a bathroom,

128
00:06:32,273 --> 00:06:33,592
and you never
said anything about it?

129
00:06:33,592 --> 00:06:35,690
Look, all right, look, I wasn't
trying to be crypto about it,

130
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:39,498
it's just, like, Frank,
I just never liked
sleeping in a room with
an empty room behind me.

131
00:06:39,498 --> 00:06:41,120
You got to understand that,
right? It's creepy.

132
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,339
- You're supposed
to sleep in here.
-Yeah, but I just... I n...

133
00:06:44,339 --> 00:06:47,029
Great, now someone's
at the door.
I'm gonna have to walk
a mile to get it.

134
00:06:47,029 --> 00:06:50,199
This is why you don't want
all this space, Frank.

135
00:06:50,487 --> 00:06:53,649
-Yes, I'm coming, I'm coming.
All right. Jesus.

136
00:06:53,649 --> 00:06:55,507
I need a place to stay.
Let me talk to Frank.

137
00:06:55,507 --> 00:06:57,765
-What's on your hand?
-It's a piece of a door. Move past it. 

138
00:06:57,765 --> 00:07:00,119
- Frank!
-He can't hear you,
he's in the other room, okay?

139
00:07:00,119 --> 00:07:02,920
- What? What other room?
- Frank! Dee's here!

140
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:05,064
I mean, I'm gonna have
to get, like, an intercom
on the wall or something.
It's just totally nuts.

141
00:07:05,064 --> 00:07:08,276
-What? What is
going on over here?

142
00:07:08,276 --> 00:07:12,591
-Holy shit, Charlie.
This is tits. Why don't
you use this room?

143
00:07:12,672 --> 00:07:16,057
I like to keep my life simple.
I don't want to live
in a maze, you know?

144
00:07:16,132 --> 00:07:18,311
No. I don't know.
Can I sleep in here?

145
00:07:18,311 --> 00:07:19,956
Absolutely not.
Don't think about that.

146
00:07:19,956 --> 00:07:22,414
-Someone's at the door again.
Okay? I'm gonna
have to walk another mile.

147
00:07:22,414 --> 00:07:25,052
This is crazy. I mean,
I'm gonna have to get a butler.

148
00:07:25,067 --> 00:07:27,770
- I'm coming, hang on.

149
00:07:28,045 --> 00:07:30,099
-What?
-Where's Frank?

150
00:07:30,099 --> 00:07:32,124
-Why?
-We don't have to
tell you our business.

151
00:07:32,124 --> 00:07:33,775
Fine, whatever.
He's in the other room.

152
00:07:33,775 --> 00:07:36,782
- What other room?
- The other room over there, man.
That's where he is.

153
00:07:36,782 --> 00:07:39,110
- You have another room here?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah,
I got another room.

154
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:41,235
-What the hell, dude?
-MAC: What's going on?

155
00:07:41,235 --> 00:07:43,913
I mean, we're gonna
blow our shoes out
with all this walking, man.

156
00:07:43,913 --> 00:07:48,493
- Holy shit. What the hell?
-I mean, Charlie,
have you always had this?

157
00:07:48,493 --> 00:07:51,002
- Yeah, it's not a big deal.
- How is this not a big deal?

158
00:07:51,002 --> 00:07:54,835
Wait, so you truly
have no reason
to be sleeping with Frank.

159
00:07:54,919 --> 00:07:57,597
Move past it, dude.
Move past it, man.

160
00:07:57,597 --> 00:08:00,541
I will move past it
because I really, ultimately,
don't give a shit.

161
00:08:00,541 --> 00:08:04,504
Frank, listen,
we have an incredible
business opportunity
we want to talk to you about.

162
00:08:04,504 --> 00:08:05,586
All right, well,
let's talk turkey.

163
00:08:05,586 --> 00:08:07,777
What, you're gonna listen
to their idea over mine, dude?

164
00:08:07,777 --> 00:08:11,751
L-Look, the two of you,
get out of here.
I need the office. Get out.

165
00:08:11,751 --> 00:08:14,273
Oh, now it's an office?
It's an office now?

166
00:08:14,273 --> 00:08:16,613
Oh, that's great. I mean,
are we even zoned for that?

167
00:08:16,613 --> 00:08:18,198
-I'll come back tonight.

168
00:08:25,099 --> 00:08:28,234
-Yeah, so, uh,
what do you think, Frank?

169
00:08:28,234 --> 00:08:30,469
Good, good. It's got
a nice squeak to it.

170
00:08:30,469 --> 00:08:32,653
Yeah, it does have a nice
squeak to it, doesn't it?

171
00:08:32,653 --> 00:08:34,833
Hey, uh, Mac, you almost done
with that one over there, bud?

172
00:08:34,833 --> 00:08:38,755
Yeah, just finishing up.
And I am
good.

173
00:08:38,755 --> 00:08:41,115
That's a lot of blowing.

174
00:08:41,115 --> 00:08:44,757
Now, Frank,
would you like
to start this meeting off
with a Fancy Nut?

175
00:08:44,757 --> 00:08:47,395
- What happened to your lips?
- Huh?

176
00:08:47,395 --> 00:08:50,554
- What happened to your lips?
- Oh, this must...
must be from the plastic.

177
00:08:50,554 --> 00:08:52,444
It's, uh, it's probably
from all the blowing.

178
00:08:52,444 --> 00:08:56,482
-Blowing.
- The-- the plastic on these
is a little bit irritating.

179
00:08:56,482 --> 00:09:00,069
It's not the pla...
No, that's not what it is.
That's not what it is.

180
00:09:00,764 --> 00:09:02,759
That is rancid.

181
00:09:02,759 --> 00:09:06,561
Did you g...
Did you get a bad one?
Well, they're all bad.
Do not eat them.

182
00:09:06,561 --> 00:09:08,020
Okay? Either of you.

183
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:13,566
Now, Frank, as we all know,
we're living in
a time of inflation.

184
00:09:13,566 --> 00:09:17,364
But...
is inflation such a bad thing?

185
00:09:17,364 --> 00:09:23,238
Or are things
better inflated?

186
00:09:23,238 --> 00:09:25,403
Take it.

187
00:09:26,368 --> 00:09:30,122
Take a look at
that lookbook there.
Turn to the first page,
you'll see, uh...

188
00:09:30,122 --> 00:09:32,844
Hello.
DENNIS: Yeah.

189
00:09:32,844 --> 00:09:36,215
Kim Kardashian's backside,
the early years.

190
00:09:36,215 --> 00:09:39,065
Now, if you turn
to the next page...

191
00:09:41,869 --> 00:09:43,832
-Oh.
-Yeah.

192
00:09:44,804 --> 00:09:47,681
-Ooh. Ooh.
-Yes. Yes.

193
00:09:47,763 --> 00:09:52,564
As the years have gone by,
her backside has gotten bigger
and bigger. It's inflated.

194
00:09:52,641 --> 00:09:56,874
MAC:
I think what you'll find
most interesting is that
the Kardashians' net worth

195
00:09:56,943 --> 00:10:01,282
has inflated in direct
proportion to their booties.

196
00:10:02,445 --> 00:10:05,413
- What did he say?
- I'm saying that
the Kardashians'...

197
00:10:05,413 --> 00:10:09,230
-No, no, Mac, Mac, please.
Just let me. Let me, okay?

198
00:10:09,322 --> 00:10:13,252
 Okay, uh, Frank,
we would like for you to, um,

199
00:10:13,252 --> 00:10:16,927
inject some capital into
our inflatable furniture...

200
00:10:17,019 --> 00:10:18,914
I'm in.

201
00:10:18,914 --> 00:10:20,481
-DENNIS: You're in?
-Yeah.

202
00:10:20,555 --> 00:10:23,197
You... Oh, really?
You-you don't need to
hear the whole pitch?

203
00:10:23,197 --> 00:10:27,392
Nah, I'll give you the money,
but it's a loan, and you got
to pay me back with interest.

204
00:10:27,473 --> 00:10:29,470
-Oh, we like interest.
That's great.
-Yeah, no problem.

205
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:31,235
And I want to keep the
furniture for the room.

206
00:10:31,235 --> 00:10:32,509
You want to keep this?
Yeah, sure.

207
00:10:32,509 --> 00:10:35,840
And I want to
keep the book for...
other reasons.

208
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:38,343
Yeah, we-we-we figured
-you'd want to...
-Oh, okay, you're gonna...

209
00:10:38,417 --> 00:10:42,466
It's crazy. I can be,
like, a good businessman.
You know, I don't know why
he doesn't take me seriously.

210
00:10:42,466 --> 00:10:46,969
It's like, do you have
any idea how much time
I've spent, like, tracking
and researching the price
of this online currency?

211
00:10:46,969 --> 00:10:48,319
-That's got to be maddening.

212
00:10:48,319 --> 00:10:50,202
Did you glue your
hand to my door?
-Yeah, I did.

213
00:10:50,202 --> 00:10:52,927
-Why?
- Well, it's a new form
of protest, Charlie.

214
00:10:52,954 --> 00:10:56,635
People are doing it
to, you know,
call attention to injustices
or some shit.

215
00:10:56,635 --> 00:10:58,549
I don't know.
Either way, I'm locked in.

216
00:10:58,724 --> 00:11:01,789
Uh, boom.
Just like that,
we are in business.

217
00:11:01,884 --> 00:11:05,910
- He went with your idea?
- Of course he did, Charlie,
we are savvy businessmen.

218
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:09,162
- What's going on with Mac's lips?
- I-I don't know,
they're insane. It's-it's...

219
00:11:09,162 --> 00:11:13,543
- I think a little bit of
the plastic is, uh...
- Probably from all the blowing
he's been doing.

220
00:11:13,543 --> 00:11:16,440
- He's been making
homophobic jokes...
- Not homophobic.

221
00:11:16,504 --> 00:11:18,099
Uh, FYI,

222
00:11:18,132 --> 00:11:19,401
Frank, uh, does not
want to be bothered

223
00:11:19,434 --> 00:11:20,905
in there for
a little bit, you know,

224
00:11:20,938 --> 00:11:22,407
he's... he's... Well, you know.

225
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,344
-He's jacking off
into a magazine.
-Right.

226
00:11:43,817 --> 00:11:46,890
Look, Charlie,
I can tell you're mad.

227
00:11:46,923 --> 00:11:48,727
Well, it's just like,
I don't get it, man.

228
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:50,463
It's like, why do you believe
in Mac and Dennis over me?

229
00:11:50,497 --> 00:11:52,434
Look, Charlie, I'm not
investing in them

230
00:11:52,467 --> 00:11:54,304
because I believe in them.

231
00:11:54,338 --> 00:11:57,010
I'm investing in them
because I don't believe in them.

232
00:11:57,043 --> 00:11:59,348
They're gonna be paying me money
for the rest of their lives,

233
00:11:59,381 --> 00:12:02,087
like that stupid couch.

234
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:04,091
-Well, then you're just,
like, being a predator.
-Exactly.

235
00:12:04,124 --> 00:12:05,159
Well, it's not
a compliment, Frank.

236
00:12:05,193 --> 00:12:06,161
You know what?

237
00:12:06,195 --> 00:12:07,899
I can't deal with this.

238
00:12:07,932 --> 00:12:11,773
I'm going to go sleep in
the other bedroom, all right?

239
00:12:11,806 --> 00:12:14,177
What? And just leave
me here, all alone?

240
00:12:14,211 --> 00:12:15,781
Yes, yes.

241
00:12:15,814 --> 00:12:18,052
DEE:
I'm still here, goddamn it.

242
00:12:19,121 --> 00:12:20,925
Charlie, can you
please unglue me?

243
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:22,193
I got to go to the new bathroom.

244
00:12:22,227 --> 00:12:24,431
No, Dee, you
did this to yourself.

245
00:12:24,464 --> 00:12:26,435
I will glue a pillow
to the wall, though.

246
00:12:26,468 --> 00:12:28,807
-I don't want to be a bad host.
-Oh, yeah?

247
00:12:40,363 --> 00:12:42,334
You know what, man?
This was a mistake.

248
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:43,937
I-I can't sleep.

249
00:12:43,971 --> 00:12:45,908
Oh, yeah, yeah.

250
00:12:45,941 --> 00:12:47,845
You're upset and concerned

251
00:12:47,878 --> 00:12:50,183
that we got rid of
our furniture too soon.

252
00:12:50,216 --> 00:12:51,987
Nope, that's not it.

253
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:53,255
Is it the business plan?

254
00:12:53,289 --> 00:12:54,224
You're afraid
it's not gonna work?

255
00:12:54,257 --> 00:12:55,861
That's also not it.

256
00:12:55,894 --> 00:12:57,999
-Then what?
-It's your goddamn wheezing.

257
00:12:58,032 --> 00:12:59,201
Am I wheezing?

258
00:12:59,234 --> 00:13:00,871
Are you wheezing?
You sound insane.

259
00:13:00,904 --> 00:13:02,140
Are you allergic to those nuts?

260
00:13:02,173 --> 00:13:04,111
No. It's not the nuts.

261
00:13:04,144 --> 00:13:07,217
I... It's... I, uh... I think
it's from blowing up those...

262
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:08,820
No. Okay, also, I feel

263
00:13:08,854 --> 00:13:10,256
like I'm sleeping
in a tub of nuts here, man.

264
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:11,926
-Can you
stop eating them in bed?

265
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,229
-It's Charlie! Open up-- oh.
-Oh, Charlie's here.

266
00:13:13,262 --> 00:13:14,231
-Stop eating the nuts.
-It's unlocked.

267
00:13:14,264 --> 00:13:15,801
You should lock your door.

268
00:13:15,834 --> 00:13:18,139
Look, I need a place to stay.

269
00:13:18,172 --> 00:13:21,245
- No room.
-What?

270
00:13:21,278 --> 00:13:22,882
-We don't have...
-He's-he's...

271
00:13:22,915 --> 00:13:24,418
...any room.

272
00:13:24,451 --> 00:13:26,388
He's saying
we don't have any room.

273
00:13:26,422 --> 00:13:29,027
But, uh, well, hey, I can,
I can blow up my own bed

274
00:13:29,061 --> 00:13:30,396
and I can deflate it
in the morning.

275
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:31,499
I'll inflate it,
I'll deflate it.

276
00:13:31,533 --> 00:13:32,868
It'll be like I was never here.

277
00:13:32,902 --> 00:13:34,137
Plus, I brought my own nuts.

278
00:13:34,171 --> 00:13:35,541
Are they fancy?

279
00:13:35,574 --> 00:13:36,910
What? What-what is he saying?

280
00:13:36,943 --> 00:13:38,112
Are they Fancy Nuts?

281
00:13:38,145 --> 00:13:39,515
He wants to know
if they're fancy.

282
00:13:39,549 --> 00:13:41,118
Well, some are, yeah.
It's an assortment.

283
00:13:41,151 --> 00:13:42,588
Consider it an offering.

284
00:13:42,621 --> 00:13:44,191
Of war?

285
00:13:44,224 --> 00:13:45,961
Of peace. What is going
on with you, dude?

286
00:13:45,995 --> 00:13:47,965
He's allergic to nuts, okay?
I think he's gonna die.

287
00:13:47,999 --> 00:13:50,169
I'm not allergic to nuts.

288
00:13:50,203 --> 00:13:51,405
The point is, Charlie,
we can't swing it.

289
00:13:51,438 --> 00:13:53,442
Well, I have information
about Frank

290
00:13:53,476 --> 00:13:55,848
that you guys might like
to hear for your business.

291
00:13:59,287 --> 00:14:01,425
-Fine. Tell us.
- Have-have a seat.

292
00:14:01,458 --> 00:14:03,162
Okay.

293
00:14:04,431 --> 00:14:06,301
Here's how this works.

294
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:08,205
Cut me in on your operation,

295
00:14:08,239 --> 00:14:10,577
and I'll give you
the information.

296
00:14:10,611 --> 00:14:13,315
See? I am a pretty good
businessman after all.

297
00:14:15,486 --> 00:14:17,323
Okay, Charlie, you're just
trying to bribe us,

298
00:14:17,357 --> 00:14:20,163
and bartering with nuts that you
probably foraged from a tree.

299
00:14:20,196 --> 00:14:22,233
Mmm, some are from a tree, yes.

300
00:14:24,104 --> 00:14:25,908
A fancy tree?

301
00:14:25,941 --> 00:14:27,945
One of the fanciest, Mac.

302
00:14:27,978 --> 00:14:31,018
Which one?

303
00:14:32,087 --> 00:14:34,157
You ever have a pine nut?

304
00:14:34,191 --> 00:14:35,426
-Just give us
the information, please.
- Which one is...?

305
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:37,330
Fine.

306
00:14:37,363 --> 00:14:39,234
But first I want you guys
to hear about my business idea.

307
00:14:39,267 --> 00:14:42,575
No. You can stay here
one night, okay?

308
00:14:42,608 --> 00:14:44,478
But I don't want to hear
your goddamn business idea

309
00:14:44,512 --> 00:14:46,115
'cause I don't care.
Now tell us the Frank thing.

310
00:14:46,148 --> 00:14:47,383
Fine.

311
00:14:47,417 --> 00:14:48,987
Frank only lent
you guys the money

312
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:50,958
'cause he thinks
you're gonna fail.

313
00:14:50,991 --> 00:14:53,028
In fact, he wants you to fail.

314
00:14:53,062 --> 00:14:56,201
See, he's what you would
call a predatory lender,

315
00:14:56,235 --> 00:14:58,907
and he's simply taking
advantage of you guys.

316
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:01,311
-Son of a bi... Son of...
-Okay, okay.

317
00:15:01,345 --> 00:15:02,915
-All right, stop-stop talking.
-Son of a bitch.

318
00:15:02,948 --> 00:15:05,319
-Just stop-stop talking.
I get it.
-Frank.

319
00:15:05,353 --> 00:15:08,493
This is a classic
inflation-interest play.

320
00:15:08,527 --> 00:15:09,962
But I'll tell you something,

321
00:15:09,996 --> 00:15:11,064
Frank's not the only one

322
00:15:11,098 --> 00:15:12,501
who can be a predatory lender.

323
00:15:12,535 --> 00:15:14,505
I say we pivot.

324
00:15:14,539 --> 00:15:17,978
I say we don't sell people
these inflatables.

325
00:15:18,012 --> 00:15:19,649
We rent them to them.

326
00:15:31,673 --> 00:15:35,113
Well... he's hanging on.

327
00:15:35,146 --> 00:15:36,649
Doesn't sound like it.

328
00:15:40,156 --> 00:15:41,559
Rise and shine, Dee.

329
00:15:41,593 --> 00:15:43,697
-What time is it?
-It's 4:00 in the morning.

330
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:45,667
We got to go. We got work to do.

331
00:15:45,701 --> 00:15:48,372
Just grab anything small.

332
00:15:48,405 --> 00:15:50,577
Lamps are good 'cause
they're easy to run with.

333
00:15:50,611 --> 00:15:52,380
Hold on a second.
Are we robbing this place?

334
00:15:52,413 --> 00:15:53,415
-Huh?
-Hey!

335
00:15:53,449 --> 00:15:54,719
What the hell are you doing?

336
00:15:54,752 --> 00:15:56,021
You haven't paid your rent

337
00:15:56,054 --> 00:15:57,290
in three months, you deadbeat.

338
00:15:57,323 --> 00:15:58,693
You can't come in here
and take my shit.

339
00:15:58,727 --> 00:16:00,363
Oh, you want it back?
Well, then pay your rent.

340
00:16:00,396 --> 00:16:02,300
I'm getting my gun.

341
00:16:02,333 --> 00:16:04,572
Go for it, bitch!
We got bulletproof vests on!

342
00:16:04,605 --> 00:16:06,308
Oh, no, I don't. I don't
have a bulletproof vest.

343
00:16:06,341 --> 00:16:09,281
Relax, these guys are always
bluffing. Grab stuff.

344
00:16:09,314 --> 00:16:11,686
Frank, no. What is happening?
You're a slumlord now?

345
00:16:11,719 --> 00:16:13,690
Yes, I collect on these guys,

346
00:16:13,723 --> 00:16:15,326
and if they don't pay,

347
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:17,030
I throw 'em out on the street,
like I did you.

348
00:16:17,063 --> 00:16:19,167
What? You're my landlord?

349
00:16:19,201 --> 00:16:22,307
Yeah, I got tired of paying
your rent all those years,

350
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:24,010
so I bought the building.

351
00:16:24,044 --> 00:16:25,213
Why did you raise the rent?

352
00:16:25,246 --> 00:16:27,450
Inflation.
I got to increase my nut.

353
00:16:27,483 --> 00:16:29,555
-Goddamn it.
-Oh, he's hot.

354
00:16:29,589 --> 00:16:30,624
Oh, shit.

355
00:16:30,657 --> 00:16:32,126
Relax, they never shoot.

356
00:16:33,362 --> 00:16:34,999
Ah, time to go.

357
00:16:35,032 --> 00:16:37,638
Pay your rent, you deadbeat.

358
00:16:43,282 --> 00:16:45,119
Dennis, it's, like,

359
00:16:45,152 --> 00:16:47,056
I feel like we got to weigh
all this stuff down, man.

360
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:48,660
Nah, it's fine, it's fine.

361
00:16:48,693 --> 00:16:50,797
Also, I got to talk to you about
this Internet money, dude,

362
00:16:50,831 --> 00:16:53,202
because this guy does not know
what he's sitting on, man.

363
00:16:53,235 --> 00:16:54,572
-He's a chump, dude...
-Charlie, Charlie.

364
00:16:54,605 --> 00:16:56,643
Stop trying to
talk business, all right?

365
00:16:56,676 --> 00:16:58,445
-It's just not your
strong suit, all right?
-Yeah, yeah. Okay.

366
00:16:58,479 --> 00:17:00,383
Oh, here comes a customer.
Here, let me do the talking.

367
00:17:00,416 --> 00:17:02,588
Hi, sir. Hi, how are you today?

368
00:17:02,621 --> 00:17:04,090
It's a lovely day, isn't it?

369
00:17:04,124 --> 00:17:06,295
-A little windy.
-A little breezy, yeah.

370
00:17:06,328 --> 00:17:08,199
Yeah, a little breezy.
But, uh, anyway,

371
00:17:08,232 --> 00:17:09,467
are you here
to buy some furniture?

372
00:17:09,502 --> 00:17:10,637
Yes, I am.

373
00:17:10,671 --> 00:17:12,173
-Okay, great.
-Good, good.

374
00:17:12,207 --> 00:17:13,810
Hey, listen, what if I told you

375
00:17:13,843 --> 00:17:16,181
you could get
your furniture for free?

376
00:17:16,215 --> 00:17:18,185
Yeah, see, times are
very inflatable right now, okay?

377
00:17:18,219 --> 00:17:20,122
Yeah, stop, stop.

378
00:17:20,156 --> 00:17:22,795
Have you ever considered
owning an inflatable couch?

379
00:17:22,828 --> 00:17:25,601
Oh, yeah, I don't have
a pool, so...

380
00:17:25,634 --> 00:17:27,538
-A pool?
-Yeah, for the...

381
00:17:27,571 --> 00:17:30,076
-Oh, no, no, no, I see,
I see the confusion.
-Oh-oh.

382
00:17:30,109 --> 00:17:31,713
-No, we're talking about
for inside.
-Yeah, inside your house.

383
00:17:31,746 --> 00:17:33,717
Oh. What?

384
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:36,188
-Like, how much do you
currently rent your couch for?
-Yeah.

385
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:37,791
I-I don't rent my couch.

386
00:17:37,825 --> 00:17:40,096
MAC: What?

387
00:17:40,129 --> 00:17:43,803
You pay full price
for your couch?

388
00:17:43,837 --> 00:17:45,741
That's outrageous.

389
00:17:45,774 --> 00:17:49,180
-CHARLIE: Oh, shit.
-DENNIS: Oh, no.

390
00:17:50,751 --> 00:17:52,855
-Goddamn it.
-Yeah.

391
00:17:52,888 --> 00:17:55,794
I'm telling you, man, you
have got to go to the hospital.

392
00:17:55,827 --> 00:17:59,301
Oh, and spend the remainder
of our nut on medical bills?

393
00:17:59,334 --> 00:18:00,570
I don't think so, Dennis.

394
00:18:00,604 --> 00:18:03,142
I'll simply stop
blowing up the furniture.

395
00:18:03,175 --> 00:18:06,616
It is not the furniture, Mac.
Okay? It is the nuts.

396
00:18:06,649 --> 00:18:08,218
Dee, what the hell
are you doing here?

397
00:18:08,252 --> 00:18:10,389
Guys, I have information

398
00:18:10,423 --> 00:18:12,093
that will change
the course of your company,

399
00:18:12,126 --> 00:18:15,667
and I will tell you what it is
if you let me stay here.

400
00:18:15,701 --> 00:18:17,136
Yeah, no, Charlie
already tried that shit.

401
00:18:17,170 --> 00:18:18,339
-I did that move, yeah.
-Yeah.

402
00:18:18,372 --> 00:18:20,176
He, he did this.

403
00:18:20,209 --> 00:18:22,815
Yeah. Uh, Dee, why are you
gluing your hand to the wall?

404
00:18:22,848 --> 00:18:24,719
-I mean, it's no way
to solve a problem.
-CHARLIE: Yeah.

405
00:18:24,752 --> 00:18:26,288
Yeah, guys, please,

406
00:18:26,321 --> 00:18:27,524
I have a solution to
all of our problems,

407
00:18:27,558 --> 00:18:29,227
but you got to
let me talk, okay?

408
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:30,697
Now, you guys are all
completely over-leveraged,

409
00:18:30,731 --> 00:18:32,367
and that's the problem,
right? My investment,

410
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,903
this thing was only, like,
ten dollars a unit,

411
00:18:33,937 --> 00:18:35,674
then it, like, dropped down
to basically nothing,

412
00:18:35,707 --> 00:18:37,443
because it's a
speculative market, right?

413
00:18:37,477 --> 00:18:39,214
I'm making a bet that
the SEC's not gonna regulate.

414
00:18:39,247 --> 00:18:40,884
Of course, regulation's
gonna come in at some point,

415
00:18:40,917 --> 00:18:43,255
it always does, but right now
it's completely unregulated.

416
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:45,661
Now, I'm not talking about
getting out over our skis,

417
00:18:45,694 --> 00:18:47,531
I'm just talking about making
an investment tonight,

418
00:18:47,564 --> 00:18:49,835
turn it around tomorrow--
we'll net double.

419
00:18:49,869 --> 00:18:51,305
Holy shit.

420
00:18:51,338 --> 00:18:53,309
-MAC: That's money talk.
-DENNIS: Yeah.

421
00:18:53,342 --> 00:18:54,879
-That's money talk.
-Where did you learn
to talk like that?

422
00:18:54,912 --> 00:18:56,616
Living with Frank, man.
I've been trying to tell you

423
00:18:56,649 --> 00:18:58,185
that I'm picking up
on this stuff. So, look, guys,

424
00:18:58,218 --> 00:19:00,489
let's pool all of
our remaining nut together

425
00:19:00,524 --> 00:19:02,460
and turn it into
a big pile of green,

426
00:19:02,494 --> 00:19:03,863
and then everybody gets a taste.

427
00:19:04,765 --> 00:19:07,571
Okay,
I didn't love
the sound of that, but, uh...

428
00:19:07,604 --> 00:19:09,274
Was it unclear?
I was talking about, like,

429
00:19:09,307 --> 00:19:11,646
a huge pile of green, like,
and everyone is, like...

430
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:13,717
-Money talk?
-...slurping that shit down.

431
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:15,152
Let's do it.

432
00:19:17,858 --> 00:19:20,162
-Bam.
-DEE: Oh, wow.

433
00:19:20,196 --> 00:19:22,568
-I've got a lot of questions.
-Yeah, me, too.

434
00:19:22,601 --> 00:19:24,204
Sure, sure. Go ahead.

435
00:19:24,237 --> 00:19:26,943
Now, Charlie, did
you take... all of my money...

436
00:19:26,976 --> 00:19:29,247
-Mm-hmm.
...and invest it in a box

437
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,552
full of Teenage Mutant
Ninja Turtle Pies?

438
00:19:31,586 --> 00:19:33,590
Yes. Very good, Dennis.
Very good.

439
00:19:33,623 --> 00:19:34,825
I wasn't sure you knew
what they are.

440
00:19:34,859 --> 00:19:36,194
Yeah, so these are,
like, from 1991.

441
00:19:36,228 --> 00:19:38,500
These are
the original ones, right?

442
00:19:38,533 --> 00:19:40,670
Super hard to find,
super valuable.

443
00:19:40,704 --> 00:19:43,442
-Are they?
-Oh, dude, big time. Right?
So, here's what I'm thinking.

444
00:19:43,475 --> 00:19:44,779
Could we turn
these around tonight

445
00:19:44,812 --> 00:19:47,383
and make a little profit?
Sure, but I say

446
00:19:47,417 --> 00:19:48,887
we sit on them.
Maybe we eat one or two.

447
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,590
This is exactly what
I was worried about.

448
00:19:50,624 --> 00:19:52,326
Well, you're not thinking
big picture here.

449
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:54,765
-No, I'm thinking big pic...
-All right, loan's due.

450
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:56,669
First installment.

451
00:19:56,703 --> 00:19:58,205
And I'm armed

452
00:19:58,238 --> 00:20:00,911
and I got a vest,
so don't try nothing.

453
00:20:00,944 --> 00:20:03,248
What do you got there?

454
00:20:03,282 --> 00:20:04,518
1991's delicious cream-filled

455
00:20:04,552 --> 00:20:05,754
Teenage Mutant
Ninja Turtle Pies,

456
00:20:05,787 --> 00:20:07,591
fresh from the sewers to me.

457
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:10,630
Are they made from real turtle?

458
00:20:10,664 --> 00:20:12,300
Probably.

459
00:20:12,333 --> 00:20:13,703
How much you want for 'em?

460
00:20:13,737 --> 00:20:16,408
They're not for sale, Frank.

461
00:20:16,441 --> 00:20:18,947
Uh, mine... mine are for sale.

462
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:21,552
I own some of those, and mine
are definitely for sale.

463
00:20:21,586 --> 00:20:23,255
He has a very
minimal share, Frank.

464
00:20:25,259 --> 00:20:27,998
Market dictates
the value, Charlie.

465
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:30,302
Well...

466
00:20:30,336 --> 00:20:32,473
not when your demand
is more than

467
00:20:32,508 --> 00:20:34,979
the supply.

468
00:20:35,012 --> 00:20:37,684
Fine, I'll get 'em
somewhere else.

469
00:20:37,718 --> 00:20:39,655
Will you?

470
00:20:40,957 --> 00:20:42,928
Oh, I don't think so, Frank.

471
00:20:42,961 --> 00:20:44,532
DENNIS:
Oh... uh-oh.

472
00:20:44,565 --> 00:20:47,604
'Cause I bought the last
remaining ones there are.

473
00:20:47,638 --> 00:20:48,706
DENNIS:
No...

474
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:52,548
Nice work.

475
00:20:52,581 --> 00:20:54,518
And you kept it crypto.

476
00:20:54,552 --> 00:20:56,756
You should have
listened to me, Frank.

477
00:20:56,789 --> 00:20:58,927
Fine.

478
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,564
Name your price.

479
00:21:00,597 --> 00:21:04,003
Board up that new room
and the noisy toilet,

480
00:21:04,037 --> 00:21:06,609
forgive Mac and Dennis's loan,

481
00:21:06,642 --> 00:21:08,045
give Dee her apartment back,

482
00:21:08,078 --> 00:21:09,748
and return everything
to the status quo.

483
00:21:09,782 --> 00:21:11,017
That's too big a ask.

484
00:21:11,051 --> 00:21:12,654
That's inflation, Frank.

485
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:14,357
You want the pies or not?

486
00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:17,396
Fine. Done.

487
00:21:18,733 --> 00:21:20,402
Good work, Charlie.

488
00:21:20,436 --> 00:21:21,739
Thank you very much, Frank.

489
00:21:25,914 --> 00:21:28,820
I appreciate it.

490
00:21:39,575 --> 00:21:40,710
Are you still eating the nuts?

491
00:21:40,744 --> 00:21:41,913
Hmm?

492
00:21:49,127 --> 00:21:52,099
Does he want to get to
the hospital or to Costco?

493
00:21:52,133 --> 00:21:53,636
-DENNIS: Costco.
-DEE: He wants more nuts.

494
00:21:53,670 --> 00:21:55,072
CHARLIE:
Costco, yeah.

495
00:21:55,105 --> 00:21:56,809
You know what, buddy?
I think we'll take you

496
00:21:56,843 --> 00:21:58,513
to the hospital, and they'll
have nuts, and you can...

497
00:21:58,546 --> 00:21:59,882
you can die there.
