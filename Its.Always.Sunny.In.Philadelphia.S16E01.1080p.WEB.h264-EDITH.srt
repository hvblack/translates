1
00:00:05,589 --> 00:00:08,603
CHARLIE:
Did you ever see
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles?
FRANK:
No.

2
00:00:08,603 --> 00:00:11,808
The cartoon was excellent,
and the movies
were even, like,
more well-refined.

3
00:00:11,808 --> 00:00:13,294
Look at the price
of these suckers.

4
00:00:13,294 --> 00:00:14,959
-CHARLIE: Never saw it?
What are you guys looking at?

5
00:00:14,959 --> 00:00:18,209
Oh, uh, new couches.
We got rid of the old one,
but the prices are insane.

6
00:00:18,209 --> 00:00:21,000
Yeah, it's nuts, man.
I think we should just rent like
we did the last time, you know?

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,234
- Wait, you rented your sofa?
- Yeah, I mean, all we did
was pay the interest.

8
00:00:24,234 --> 00:00:27,477
- How much was the interest?
- Oh, it was nothing.
It was like 25 bucks a week.

9
00:00:27,541 --> 00:00:31,217
-How long did you have it?
-15 years, bro.
-About 15 years, yeah.

10
00:00:31,217 --> 00:00:34,818
You spent close to $20,000
on a couch you never owned.

11
00:00:34,818 --> 00:00:36,498
-$20,000...
-No.

12
00:00:36,498 --> 00:00:37,650
-Where are you getting
that from?
-No.

13
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:40,190
52 weeks a year, $25 a week.

14
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:45,336
15 years.
$19,500.

15
00:00:45,336 --> 00:00:48,112
- That seems high.
- That's pretty
bad business, fellas.

16
00:00:48,112 --> 00:00:51,092
I don't understand why prices
are so high right now.

17
00:00:51,092 --> 00:00:52,831
-Inflation.
-Yeah.

18
00:00:52,831 --> 00:00:56,206
-Right, yeah.
-Oh, well, right.

19
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:57,315
-Inflation, yeah.
-I mean, because of
the inflation.

20
00:00:57,315 --> 00:00:59,693
You guys do understand
what inflation is, right?

21
00:00:59,693 --> 00:01:03,266
Inflation?
Yeah, yes, absolutely.
For the sake
of argument...

22
00:01:03,339 --> 00:01:04,600
-Yeah.
-...pretend we don't.

23
00:01:04,677 --> 00:01:08,554
Inflation is when the price
of goods and services go up.

24
00:01:10,941 --> 00:01:12,605
Frank, oh, thank God.

25
00:01:12,605 --> 00:01:16,343
Hey, I'm being evicted.
The-the landlord,
he jacked up my rent
and I can't pay.

26
00:01:16,343 --> 00:01:19,652
Now, listen, I have glued
my hand to the door,
so they can't
physically remove me...

27
00:01:19,652 --> 00:01:21,966
Just a second, Deandra.

28
00:01:21,966 --> 00:01:26,075
See, inflation happens when
there's more demand
than there is supply.

29
00:01:26,075 --> 00:01:28,725
CHARLIE: Frank, I don't think
they're get...
You want me to, you want me
to walk 'em through it?

30
00:01:28,725 --> 00:01:30,926
-Charlie.
- Yeah, you shut up, Charlie.
You don't understand any of it.

31
00:01:30,926 --> 00:01:34,325
That's not true. Dude, I've
learned a lot about business
living with Frank.
You know, I know stuff.

32
00:01:34,325 --> 00:01:38,399
Also, speaking of,
I got an investment idea
that I'd love
to pitch you guys if I...

33
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,551
- Paddy's.
- DEE:
Do not hang up on...

34
00:01:40,551 --> 00:01:42,992
Charlie, we don't want to
hear it. Frank, keep going.

35
00:01:42,992 --> 00:01:46,623
Well, you see, the government
tries to curb inflation
by raising interest rates,

36
00:01:46,623 --> 00:01:49,066
so that people borrow less
and spend less.

37
00:01:49,066 --> 00:01:52,101
Okay, so if prices are
going up, can we get a raise?

38
00:01:52,101 --> 00:01:55,273
-No, well, you see,
if I raise your wages,
-then you'd have more money.

39
00:01:55,273 --> 00:01:57,903
And that, in this case,
is not good.
-CHARLIE: No.

40
00:01:57,903 --> 00:02:00,350
You know, it would
increase inflation.

41
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:02,583
And we don't want that
to increase, right?

42
00:02:02,583 --> 00:02:06,118
So maybe what we would
need to do is lower
our wages. I get it.

43
00:02:06,118 --> 00:02:08,254
But that would
cause a recession.
Yeah.

44
00:02:08,254 --> 00:02:10,262
Which could lead
to a depression.

45
00:02:10,262 --> 00:02:11,997
-So you can't.
-You can't do that.

46
00:02:11,997 --> 00:02:14,227
-MAC: Which we can't,
of course...
...take a pay cut.

47
00:02:14,227 --> 00:02:16,868
-Or a raise.
-Mm-mm, mm-mm.
-Mm-mm, no.

48
00:02:16,937 --> 00:02:19,542
- That's money talk.
- Yeah, that's money
talk right there.

49
00:02:19,542 --> 00:02:21,443
Basically, it boils down
to your nut, right?

50
00:02:21,443 --> 00:02:24,025
Like, how much, like, nut do
you go through a month, right?

51
00:02:24,025 --> 00:02:26,133
-Are you storing up your nut or
are you just blowing through it?

52
00:02:26,133 --> 00:02:29,154
-Like, okay, um, how much nut
do you guys blow through
in a month?

53
00:02:29,227 --> 00:02:31,157
-A ton.
-I don't want to talk
to you about...

54
00:02:31,157 --> 00:02:33,072
Yeah, I figured you were, man.

55
00:02:33,072 --> 00:02:35,933
-So, you got, you got to try to
hang on to some of that nut.
Otherwise it's all gone.

56
00:02:35,933 --> 00:02:39,362
But that's the screwy
thing about it.
Money isn't as valuable
as it always was...

57
00:02:39,362 --> 00:02:41,032
And money's not
as valuable, right?

58
00:02:41,032 --> 00:02:44,323
How can the value
of money be different?
Money is money.

59
00:02:44,323 --> 00:02:48,307
-No, a buck is not worth a buck.
No, no, it's worth
25 cents right now.

60
00:02:48,307 --> 00:02:50,146
-A dollar is worth 25 cents?
-Yeah.

61
00:02:50,146 --> 00:02:53,782
- Yeah, but I'll give you
50 cents for a buck.
- Hey.

62
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:58,572
Uh, I think that sounds
like a good deal.

63
00:03:00,567 --> 00:03:04,514
Frank, you got to wire me money!
They, they're unscrewing my...

64
00:03:04,514 --> 00:03:06,974
Okay, you know what?
I only have a ten.
I'll give you a five.

65
00:03:06,974 --> 00:03:10,685
- That's money talk. Let's go.
-Nice, nice, yeah.

66
00:03:10,685 --> 00:03:12,635
-Deal.
-Deal.

67
00:03:36,714 --> 00:03:39,312
Uh, Mac, you know, I'm-I'm
crunching the numbers over

68
00:03:39,312 --> 00:03:42,016
and I'm-I'm getting a little
concerned about our nut.

69
00:03:42,016 --> 00:03:45,995
How much money are you spending
on these Dwayne Johnson
energy drinks?

70
00:03:45,995 --> 00:03:48,675
MAC: Quite a bit.
I basically live on them now.

71
00:03:48,675 --> 00:03:50,245
Maybe you could
cut back a little bit.

72
00:03:50,245 --> 00:03:53,263
I mean, you don't
have to buy everything
The Rock tries
to sell you, you know.

73
00:03:53,263 --> 00:03:55,155
Interesting. What am
I looking at here?

74
00:03:55,155 --> 00:03:58,193
Come. Have a seat.

75
00:04:00,412 --> 00:04:03,295
Oh, shit.
An inflatable couch?

76
00:04:03,295 --> 00:04:04,971
-Yeah.
It was super cheap, dude.

77
00:04:04,971 --> 00:04:07,877
Now, this is just
a temporary option
until we make enough nut

78
00:04:07,877 --> 00:04:10,229
for us to afford
an actual couch.

79
00:04:10,229 --> 00:04:13,573
But it will
lower our monthly nut
because we're not
renting this bad boy.

80
00:04:13,573 --> 00:04:15,206
Dennis, we own it.

81
00:04:15,206 --> 00:04:18,581
-Oh.
-And speaking of nuts,
I also purchased these.

82
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:21,597
- Okay, went, went real literal
with it, didn't you?
- Yeah, yeah.

83
00:04:21,597 --> 00:04:23,533
-Fancy Nuts.
-These are very fancy.

84
00:04:23,533 --> 00:04:26,091
-Are they? Three dollars?
-Yeah, yeah,
only-only three dollars.

85
00:04:26,091 --> 00:04:28,624
Now, we could live on
these bad boys for weeks.

86
00:04:28,624 --> 00:04:31,182
Mm-hmm. Well, listen,
I don't really have any interest

87
00:04:31,182 --> 00:04:34,411
in your, uh, bulk tin
of low-end economy nuts,

88
00:04:34,411 --> 00:04:38,774
but I am finding this couch idea
to be pretty interesting,

89
00:04:38,774 --> 00:04:42,569
and it's giving me another idea
of how we could possibly

90
00:04:42,569 --> 00:04:44,614
"inflate" things
a little further.

91
00:04:44,614 --> 00:04:48,337
Oh, well, you can't
inflate this any further
'cause it'll pop.

92
00:04:48,337 --> 00:04:49,245
Just a figure of speech.

93
00:04:49,319 --> 00:04:52,425
No, trust me, I-I tried.
I-I already popped two
of them earlier today.

94
00:04:52,425 --> 00:04:53,734
-Did you?
-Yeah.

95
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:57,445
-Okay.
-I just kept blowing
and blowing and blowing,
and just... boom.

96
00:04:57,530 --> 00:04:59,419
Okay, all right,
well, that's okay.

97
00:04:59,419 --> 00:05:02,557
- You really shouldn't,
it's dangerous.
-I understand
what you're saying.

98
00:05:02,557 --> 00:05:03,755
I'm serious, Dennis.
Don't blow this up...

99
00:05:03,755 --> 00:05:06,767
I'm not going to do it.
I get what you're saying.
It's very clear.

100
00:05:06,767 --> 00:05:08,766
Okay.

101
00:05:12,294 --> 00:05:16,227
Charlie.
Check this out, a new lamp.

102
00:05:16,227 --> 00:05:18,255
-It looks like an old lamp,
but listen...
-It's a new lamp.

103
00:05:18,255 --> 00:05:21,501
-What's with the lamps, man?
You keep coming back
with all this junk.
That's like the fifth lamp
you've brought back.

104
00:05:21,501 --> 00:05:26,295
-Don't worry about it.
Where you want to put it?
-I don't know, stick it in
the storage closet or something.

105
00:05:26,295 --> 00:05:29,707
Frank, can I talk
to you a second
about this
investment idea I got?
Like, 'cause this is...

106
00:05:29,707 --> 00:05:33,797
-Oh, whoa.
Ah, this...
this place is packed.
- Right, yeah. Don't make a mess.

107
00:05:33,797 --> 00:05:37,502
Like, listen, Frank,
this could be, like, huge, man,
because I've been
tracking this thing.

108
00:05:37,502 --> 00:05:40,317
It's this, like, like, Internet
money kind of situation, right?

109
00:05:40,317 --> 00:05:42,921
Wha-What, crypto?
I'm not into crypto.

110
00:05:42,921 --> 00:05:45,712
Well, it'd be a lot less cryptic
if I could show you the video.
There's a video...

111
00:05:45,712 --> 00:05:49,065
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait. What-What's this?

112
00:05:49,065 --> 00:05:50,821
Is that a toilet?

113
00:05:52,498 --> 00:05:53,251
Uh... yeah.

114
00:05:53,251 --> 00:05:55,750
You mean to tell me we've been
living here all this time,

115
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:58,447
and you never told me
we had a bathroom?

116
00:05:58,447 --> 00:06:02,288
It's really, like, noisy.
It runs all the time.
It's not a good one.

117
00:06:02,288 --> 00:06:04,148
We piss in cans, Charlie.

118
00:06:04,148 --> 00:06:07,071
You can always go
number two down the hall,
and, like, it's a good system.

119
00:06:07,071 --> 00:06:09,563
- What else are you
hiding from me?
- Nothing,

120
00:06:09,563 --> 00:06:11,670
Frank.
I'm trying to talk
to you about business.

121
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:14,377
- What's behind that door?
- That's the neighbor's door.

122
00:06:14,377 --> 00:06:16,766
-Hold this. Hold this lamp.
-Stop, Frank.

123
00:06:16,766 --> 00:06:19,588
Listen, man,
I don't want to have to be
constantly cleaning
toilets...

124
00:06:19,588 --> 00:06:21,869
-Holy shit.
-Yeah, yeah.

125
00:06:21,869 --> 00:06:24,772
What the fuck is this?
-Yeah, okay.

126
00:06:24,772 --> 00:06:27,904
-Is this a bedroom?
- Um, I mean...

127
00:06:27,904 --> 00:06:32,273
Charlie, you mean
we've been living
in a two-bedroom
with a bathroom,

128
00:06:32,273 --> 00:06:33,592
and you never
said anything about it?

129
00:06:33,592 --> 00:06:35,690
Look, all right, look, I wasn't
trying to be crypto about it,

130
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:39,498
it's just, like, Frank,
I just never liked
sleeping in a room with
an empty room behind me.

131
00:06:39,498 --> 00:06:41,120
You got to understand that,
right? It's creepy.

132
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,339
- You're supposed
to sleep in here.
-Yeah, but I just... I n...

133
00:06:44,339 --> 00:06:47,029
Great, now someone's
at the door.
I'm gonna have to walk
a mile to get it.

134
00:06:47,029 --> 00:06:50,199
This is why you don't want
all this space, Frank.

135
00:06:50,487 --> 00:06:53,649
-Yes, I'm coming, I'm coming.
All right. Jesus.

136
00:06:53,649 --> 00:06:55,507
I need a place to stay.
Let me talk to Frank.

137
00:06:55,507 --> 00:06:57,765
-What's on your hand?
-It's a piece of a door. Move past it.

138
00:06:57,765 --> 00:07:00,119
- Frank!
-He can't hear you,
he's in the other room, okay?

139
00:07:00,119 --> 00:07:02,920
- What? What other room?
- Frank! Dee's here!

140
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:05,064
I mean, I'm gonna have
to get, like, an intercom
on the wall or something.
It's just totally nuts.

141
00:07:05,064 --> 00:07:08,276
-What? What is
going on over here?

142
00:07:08,276 --> 00:07:12,591
-Holy shit, Charlie.
This is tits. Why don't
you use this room?

143
00:07:12,672 --> 00:07:16,057
I like to keep my life simple.
I don't want to live
in a maze, you know?

144
00:07:16,132 --> 00:07:18,311
No. I don't know.
Can I sleep in here?

145
00:07:18,311 --> 00:07:19,956
Absolutely not.
Don't think about that.

146
00:07:19,956 --> 00:07:22,414
-Someone's at the door again.
Okay? I'm gonna
have to walk another mile.

147
00:07:22,414 --> 00:07:25,052
This is crazy. I mean,
I'm gonna have to get a butler.

148
00:07:25,067 --> 00:07:27,770
- I'm coming, hang on.

149
00:07:28,045 --> 00:07:30,099
-What?
-Where's Frank?

150
00:07:30,099 --> 00:07:32,124
-Why?
-We don't have to
tell you our business.

151
00:07:32,124 --> 00:07:33,775
Fine, whatever.
He's in the other room.

152
00:07:33,775 --> 00:07:36,782
- What other room?
- The other room over there, man.
That's where he is.

153
00:07:36,782 --> 00:07:39,110
- You have another room here?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah,
I got another room.

154
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:41,235
-What the hell, dude?
-MAC: What's going on?

155
00:07:41,235 --> 00:07:43,913
I mean, we're gonna
blow our shoes out
with all this walking, man.

156
00:07:43,913 --> 00:07:48,493
- Holy shit. What the hell?
-I mean, Charlie,
have you always had this?

157
00:07:48,493 --> 00:07:51,002
- Yeah, it's not a big deal.
- How is this not a big deal?

158
00:07:51,002 --> 00:07:54,835
Wait, so you truly
have no reason
to be sleeping with Frank.

159
00:07:54,919 --> 00:07:57,597
Move past it, dude.
Move past it, man.

160
00:07:57,597 --> 00:08:00,541
I will move past it
because I really, ultimately,
don't give a shit.

161
00:08:00,541 --> 00:08:04,504
Frank, listen,
we have an incredible
business opportunity
we want to talk to you about.

162
00:08:04,504 --> 00:08:05,586
All right, well,
let's talk turkey.

163
00:08:05,586 --> 00:08:07,777
What, you're gonna listen
to their idea over mine, dude?

164
00:08:07,777 --> 00:08:11,751
L-Look, the two of you,
get out of here.
I need the office. Get out.

165
00:08:11,751 --> 00:08:14,273
Oh, now it's an office?
It's an office now?

166
00:08:14,273 --> 00:08:16,613
Oh, that's great. I mean,
are we even zoned for that?

167
00:08:16,613 --> 00:08:18,198
-I'll come back tonight.

168
00:08:25,099 --> 00:08:28,234
-Yeah, so, uh,
what do you think, Frank?

169
00:08:28,234 --> 00:08:30,469
Good, good. It's got
a nice squeak to it.

170
00:08:30,469 --> 00:08:32,653
Yeah, it does have a nice
squeak to it, doesn't it?

171
00:08:32,653 --> 00:08:34,833
Hey, uh, Mac, you almost done
with that one over there, bud?

172
00:08:34,833 --> 00:08:38,755
Yeah, just finishing up.
And I am
good.

173
00:08:38,755 --> 00:08:41,115
That's a lot of blowing.

174
00:08:41,115 --> 00:08:44,757
Now, Frank,
would you like
to start this meeting off
with a Fancy Nut?

175
00:08:44,757 --> 00:08:47,395
- What happened to your lips?
- Huh?

176
00:08:47,395 --> 00:08:50,554
- What happened to your lips?
- Oh, this must...
must be from the plastic.

177
00:08:50,554 --> 00:08:52,444
It's, uh, it's probably
from all the blowing.

178
00:08:52,444 --> 00:08:56,482
-Blowing.
- The-- the plastic on these
is a little bit irritating.

179
00:08:56,482 --> 00:09:00,069
It's not the pla...
No, that's not what it is.
That's not what it is.

180
00:09:00,764 --> 00:09:02,759
That is rancid.

181
00:09:02,759 --> 00:09:06,561
Did you g...
Did you get a bad one?
Well, they're all bad.
Do not eat them.

182
00:09:06,561 --> 00:09:08,020
Okay? Either of you.

183
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:13,566
Now, Frank, as we all know,
we're living in
a time of inflation.

184
00:09:13,566 --> 00:09:17,364
But...
is inflation such a bad thing?

185
00:09:17,364 --> 00:09:23,238
Or are things
better inflated?

186
00:09:23,238 --> 00:09:25,403
Take it.

187
00:09:26,368 --> 00:09:30,122
Take a look at
that lookbook there.
Turn to the first page,
you'll see, uh...

188
00:09:30,122 --> 00:09:32,844
Hello.
DENNIS: Yeah.

189
00:09:32,844 --> 00:09:36,215
Kim Kardashian's backside,
the early years.

190
00:09:36,215 --> 00:09:39,065
Now, if you turn
to the next page...

191
00:09:41,869 --> 00:09:43,832
-Oh.
-Yeah.

192
00:09:44,804 --> 00:09:47,681
-Ooh. Ooh.
-Yes. Yes.

193
00:09:47,763 --> 00:09:52,564
As the years have gone by,
her backside has gotten bigger
and bigger. It's inflated.

194
00:09:52,641 --> 00:09:56,874
MAC:
I think what you'll find
most interesting is that
the Kardashians' net worth

195
00:09:56,943 --> 00:10:01,282
has inflated in direct
proportion to their booties.

196
00:10:02,445 --> 00:10:05,413
- What did he say?
- I'm saying that
the Kardashians'...

197
00:10:05,413 --> 00:10:09,230
-No, no, Mac, Mac, please.
Just let me. Let me, okay?

198
00:10:09,322 --> 00:10:13,252
Okay, uh, Frank,
we would like for you to, um,

199
00:10:13,252 --> 00:10:16,927
inject some capital into
our inflatable furniture...

200
00:10:17,019 --> 00:10:18,914
I'm in.

201
00:10:18,914 --> 00:10:20,481
-DENNIS: You're in?
-Yeah.

202
00:10:20,555 --> 00:10:23,197
You... Oh, really?
You-you don't need to
hear the whole pitch?

203
00:10:23,197 --> 00:10:27,392
Nah, I'll give you the money,
but it's a loan, and you got
to pay me back with interest.

204
00:10:27,473 --> 00:10:29,470
-Oh, we like interest.
That's great.
-Yeah, no problem.

205
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:31,235
And I want to keep the
furniture for the room.

206
00:10:31,235 --> 00:10:32,509
You want to keep this?
Yeah, sure.

207
00:10:32,509 --> 00:10:35,840
And I want to
keep the book for...
other reasons.

208
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:38,343
Yeah, we-we-we figured
-you'd want to...
-Oh, okay, you're gonna...

209
00:10:38,417 --> 00:10:42,466
It's crazy. I can be,
like, a good businessman.
You know, I don't know why
he doesn't take me seriously.

210
00:10:42,466 --> 00:10:46,969
It's like, do you have
any idea how much time
I've spent, like, tracking
and researching the price
of this online currency?

211
00:10:46,969 --> 00:10:48,319
-That's got to be maddening.

212
00:10:48,319 --> 00:10:50,202
Did you glue your
hand to my door?
-Yeah, I did.

213
00:10:50,202 --> 00:10:52,927
-Why?
- Well, it's a new form
of protest, Charlie.

214
00:10:52,954 --> 00:10:56,635
People are doing it
to, you know,
call attention to injustices
or some shit.

215
00:10:56,635 --> 00:10:58,549
I don't know.
Either way, I'm locked in.

216
00:10:58,724 --> 00:11:01,789
Uh, boom.
Just like that,
we are in business.

217
00:11:01,884 --> 00:11:05,910
- He went with your idea?
- Of course he did, Charlie,
we are savvy businessmen.

218
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:09,162
- What's going on with Mac's lips?
- I-I don't know,
they're insane. It's-it's...

219
00:11:09,162 --> 00:11:13,543
- I think a little bit of
the plastic is, uh...
- Probably from all the blowing
he's been doing.

220
00:11:13,543 --> 00:11:16,440
- He's been making
homophobic jokes...
- Not homophobic.

221
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:19,962
Uh, FYI,
Frank, uh, does not
want to be bothered
in there for
a little bit, you know,

222
00:11:19,962 --> 00:11:21,695
he's... he's... Well, you know.

223
00:11:21,695 --> 00:11:24,584
-He's jacking off
into a magazine.
-Right.

224
00:11:43,017 --> 00:11:45,682
Look, Charlie,
I can tell you're mad.

225
00:11:45,682 --> 00:11:47,571
Well, it's just like,
I don't get it, man.

226
00:11:47,643 --> 00:11:49,734
It's like, why do you believe
in Mac and Dennis over me?

227
00:11:49,734 --> 00:11:53,288
Look, Charlie, I'm not
investing in them
because I believe in them.

228
00:11:53,288 --> 00:11:56,101
I'm investing in them
because I don't believe in them.

229
00:11:56,101 --> 00:12:00,736
They're gonna be paying me money
for the rest of their lives,
like that stupid couch.

230
00:12:00,736 --> 00:12:03,273
-Well, then you're just,
like, being a predator.
-Exactly.

231
00:12:03,273 --> 00:12:04,845
Well, it's not
a compliment, Frank.

232
00:12:04,845 --> 00:12:07,021
You know what?
I can't deal with this.

233
00:12:07,095 --> 00:12:10,649
I'm going to go sleep in
the other bedroom, all right?

234
00:12:10,704 --> 00:12:15,085
- What? And just leave
me here, all alone?
- Yes, yes.

235
00:12:15,085 --> 00:12:17,943
DEE:
I'm still here, goddamn it.

236
00:12:18,198 --> 00:12:21,208
Charlie, can you
please unglue me?
I got to go to the new bathroom.

237
00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:23,461
No, Dee, you
did this to yourself.

238
00:12:23,461 --> 00:12:28,322
I will glue a pillow
to the wall, though.
I don't want to be a bad host.
-Oh, yeah?

239
00:12:39,624 --> 00:12:42,944
You know what, man?
This was a mistake.
I-I can't sleep.

240
00:12:42,944 --> 00:12:47,023
Oh, yeah, yeah.
You're upset and concerned

241
00:12:47,023 --> 00:12:50,900
- that we got rid of
our furniture too soon.
- Nope, that's not it.

242
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:54,975
- Is it the business plan?
You're afraid
it's not gonna work?
- That's also not it.

243
00:12:54,975 --> 00:12:57,495
-Then what?
-It's your goddamn wheezing.

244
00:12:57,495 --> 00:12:59,957
- Am I wheezing?
- Are you wheezing?
You sound insane.

245
00:12:59,994 --> 00:13:03,670
- Are you allergic to those nuts?
- No. It's not the nuts.

246
00:13:03,689 --> 00:13:06,435
I... It's... I, uh... I think
it's from blowing up those...

247
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:10,171
No. Okay, also, I feel
like I'm sleeping
in a tub of nuts here, man.
Can you
stop eating them in bed?

248
00:13:10,171 --> 00:13:12,047
-It's Charlie! Open up-- oh.
-Oh, Charlie's here.

249
00:13:12,047 --> 00:13:15,011
-It's unlocked.
You should lock your door.

250
00:13:15,011 --> 00:13:17,789
Look, I need a place to stay.

251
00:13:17,789 --> 00:13:20,751
- No room.
-What?

252
00:13:20,751 --> 00:13:23,581
-We don't have...
...any room.

253
00:13:23,581 --> 00:13:25,507
He's saying
we don't have any room.

254
00:13:25,507 --> 00:13:29,412
But, uh, well, hey, I can,
I can blow up my own bed
and I can deflate it
in the morning.

255
00:13:29,412 --> 00:13:31,544
I'll inflate it,
I'll deflate it.
It'll be like I was never here.

256
00:13:31,544 --> 00:13:33,606
Plus, I brought my own nuts.

257
00:13:33,606 --> 00:13:36,117
- Are they fancy?
- What? What-what is he saying?

258
00:13:36,183 --> 00:13:38,938
- Are they Fancy Nuts?
- He wants to know
if they're fancy.

259
00:13:38,938 --> 00:13:41,747
Well, some are, yeah.
It's an assortment.
Consider it an offering.

260
00:13:41,747 --> 00:13:44,994
- Of war?
- Of peace. What is going
on with you, dude?

261
00:13:44,994 --> 00:13:46,662
He's allergic to nuts, okay?
I think he's gonna die.

262
00:13:46,737 --> 00:13:48,818
I'm not allergic to nuts.

263
00:13:48,818 --> 00:13:50,769
The point is, Charlie,
we can't swing it.

264
00:13:50,769 --> 00:13:55,706
Well, I have information
about Frank
that you guys might like
to hear for your business.

265
00:13:57,865 --> 00:14:00,563
-Fine. Tell us.
- Have-have a seat.

266
00:14:00,563 --> 00:14:02,285
Okay.

267
00:14:02,746 --> 00:14:05,277
Here's how this works.

268
00:14:05,277 --> 00:14:09,286
Cut me in on your operation,
and I'll give you
the information.

269
00:14:09,286 --> 00:14:13,242
See? I am a pretty good
businessman after all.

270
00:14:14,331 --> 00:14:19,387
Okay, Charlie, you're just
trying to bribe us,
and bartering with nuts that you
probably foraged from a tree.

271
00:14:19,387 --> 00:14:22,298
Mmm, some are from a tree, yes.

272
00:14:23,404 --> 00:14:27,260
- A fancy tree?
- One of the fanciest, Mac.

273
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:30,740
Which one?

274
00:14:31,204 --> 00:14:32,873
You ever have a pine nut?

275
00:14:32,873 --> 00:14:34,635
-Just give us
the information, please.
- Which one is...?

276
00:14:34,635 --> 00:14:38,535
Fine.
But first I want you guys
to hear about my business idea.

277
00:14:38,535 --> 00:14:41,603
No. You can stay here
one night, okay?

278
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:45,871
But I don't want to hear
your goddamn business idea
'cause I don't care.
Now tell us the Frank thing.

279
00:14:45,871 --> 00:14:47,383
Fine.

280
00:14:47,417 --> 00:14:49,949
Frank only lent
you guys the money
'cause he thinks
you're gonna fail.

281
00:14:49,949 --> 00:14:52,241
In fact, he wants you to fail.

282
00:14:52,241 --> 00:14:55,326
See, he's what you would
call a predatory lender,

283
00:14:55,326 --> 00:14:57,611
and he's simply taking
advantage of you guys.

284
00:14:57,611 --> 00:15:00,196
-Son of a bi... Son of...

285
00:15:00,196 --> 00:15:02,620
-Okay, okay. All right, stop-stop talking.
-Son of a bitch.

286
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:04,017
-Just stop-stop talking.
I get it.

287
00:15:04,017 --> 00:15:07,663
This is a classic
inflation-interest play.

288
00:15:07,663 --> 00:15:11,340
But I'll tell you something,
Frank's not the only one
who can be a predatory lender.

289
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:13,494
I say we pivot.

290
00:15:13,494 --> 00:15:17,110
I say we don't sell people
these inflatables.

291
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:19,840
We rent them to them.

292
00:15:32,501 --> 00:15:36,677
- Well... he's hanging on.
- Doesn't sound like it.

293
00:15:38,985 --> 00:15:41,944
- Rise and shine, Dee.
-What time is it?

294
00:15:41,944 --> 00:15:45,153
-It's 4:00 in the morning.
We got to go. We got work to do.

295
00:15:45,153 --> 00:15:49,808
Just grab anything small.
Lamps are good 'cause
they're easy to run with.

296
00:15:49,808 --> 00:15:52,199
Hold on a second.
Are we robbing this place?

297
00:15:52,199 --> 00:15:54,000
-Hey!
What the hell are you doing?

298
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,280
You haven't paid your rent
in three months, you deadbeat.

299
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:57,636
You can't come in here
and take my shit.

300
00:15:57,636 --> 00:15:59,745
Oh, you want it back?
Well, then pay your rent.

301
00:15:59,745 --> 00:16:00,947
I'm getting my gun.

302
00:16:00,947 --> 00:16:03,783
Go for it, bitch!
We got bulletproof vests on!

303
00:16:03,783 --> 00:16:05,501
Oh, no, I don't. I don't
have a bulletproof vest.

304
00:16:05,501 --> 00:16:08,264
Relax, these guys are always
bluffing. Grab stuff.

305
00:16:08,264 --> 00:16:11,105
Frank, no. What is happening?
You're a slumlord now?

306
00:16:11,105 --> 00:16:12,997
Yes, I collect on these guys,

307
00:16:12,997 --> 00:16:16,078
and if they don't pay,
I throw 'em out on the street,
like I did you.

308
00:16:16,078 --> 00:16:18,911
- What? You're my landlord?
- Yeah, 

309
00:16:18,911 --> 00:16:23,176
I got tired of paying
your rent all those years,
so I bought the building.

310
00:16:23,249 --> 00:16:26,582
- Why did you raise the rent?
- Inflation.
I got to increase my nut.

311
00:16:26,582 --> 00:16:28,609
-Goddamn it.
-Oh, he's hot.

312
00:16:28,609 --> 00:16:32,221
- Oh, shit.
- Relax, they never shoot.

313
00:16:32,834 --> 00:16:36,692
Ah, time to go.
Pay your rent, you deadbeat.

314
00:16:42,482 --> 00:16:46,537
Dennis, it's, like,
I feel like we got to weigh
all this stuff down, man.

315
00:16:46,537 --> 00:16:47,608
Nah, it's fine, it's fine.

316
00:16:47,608 --> 00:16:52,607
Also, I got to talk to you about
this Internet money, dude,
because this guy does not know
what he's sitting on, man.

317
00:16:52,607 --> 00:16:55,572
-He's a chump, dude...
-Charlie, Charlie.
Stop trying to
talk business, all right?

318
00:16:55,572 --> 00:16:57,439
-It's just not your
strong suit, all right?
-Yeah, yeah. Okay.

319
00:16:57,439 --> 00:16:59,569
Oh, here comes a customer.
Here, let me do the talking.

320
00:16:59,569 --> 00:17:03,237
Hi, sir. Hi, how are you today?
It's a lovely day, isn't it?

321
00:17:03,237 --> 00:17:05,401
-A little windy.
-A little breezy, yeah.

322
00:17:05,414 --> 00:17:08,815
Yeah, a little breezy.
But, uh, anyway,
are you here
to buy some furniture?

323
00:17:08,828 --> 00:17:10,810
Yes, I am.
-Okay, great.
-Good, good.

324
00:17:10,810 --> 00:17:15,335
Hey, listen, what if I told you
you could get
your furniture for free?

325
00:17:15,335 --> 00:17:19,009
- Yeah, see, times are
very inflatable right now, okay?
- Yeah, stop, stop.

326
00:17:19,009 --> 00:17:22,209
Have you ever considered
owning an inflatable couch?

327
00:17:22,209 --> 00:17:24,770
Oh, yeah, I don't have
a pool, so...

328
00:17:24,770 --> 00:17:26,637
-A pool?
-Yeah, for the...

329
00:17:26,637 --> 00:17:29,119
-Oh, no, no, no, I see,
I see the confusion.

330
00:17:29,119 --> 00:17:32,140
-No, we're talking about
for inside.
-Yeah, inside your house.

331
00:17:32,235 --> 00:17:35,147
Oh. What?
-Like, how much do you
currently rent your couch for?

332
00:17:35,147 --> 00:17:37,170
I-I don't rent my couch.

333
00:17:37,170 --> 00:17:39,067
MAC: What?

334
00:17:39,067 --> 00:17:43,102
You pay full price
for your couch?

335
00:17:43,102 --> 00:17:45,422
That's outrageous.

336
00:17:45,422 --> 00:17:48,982
-CHARLIE: Oh, shit.
-DENNIS: Oh, no.

337
00:17:49,725 --> 00:17:52,482
-Goddamn it.
-Yeah.

338
00:17:52,482 --> 00:17:55,030
I'm telling you, man, you
have got to go to the hospital.

339
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:58,415
Oh, and spend the remainder
of our nut on medical bills?

340
00:17:58,415 --> 00:18:02,172
I don't think so, Dennis.
I'll simply stop
blowing up the furniture.

341
00:18:02,172 --> 00:18:05,640
It is not the furniture, Mac.
Okay? It is the nuts.

342
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,533
Dee, what the hell
are you doing here?

343
00:18:07,533 --> 00:18:11,155
Guys, I have information
that will change
the course of your company,

344
00:18:11,155 --> 00:18:14,757
and I will tell you what it is
if you let me stay here.

345
00:18:14,757 --> 00:18:17,072
Yeah, no, Charlie
already tried that shit.
-I did that move, yeah.

346
00:18:17,072 --> 00:18:18,974
He, he did this.

347
00:18:18,974 --> 00:18:23,318
Yeah. Uh, Dee, why are you
gluing your hand to the wall?
I mean, it's no way
to solve a problem.

348
00:18:23,318 --> 00:18:27,916
Yeah, guys, please,
I have a solution to
all of our problems,
but you got to
let me talk, okay?

349
00:18:27,916 --> 00:18:30,642
Now, you guys are all
completely over-leveraged,
and that's the problem,
right?

350
00:18:30,642 --> 00:18:32,790
 My investment,
this thing was only, like,
ten dollars a unit,

351
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:36,546
then it, like, dropped down
to basically nothing,
because it's a
speculative market, right?

352
00:18:36,546 --> 00:18:38,556
I'm making a bet that
the SEC's not gonna regulate.

353
00:18:38,556 --> 00:18:42,495
Of course, regulation's
gonna come in at some point,
it always does, but right now
it's completely unregulated.

354
00:18:42,495 --> 00:18:44,679
Now, I'm not talking about
getting out over our skis,

355
00:18:44,679 --> 00:18:49,471
I'm just talking about making
an investment tonight,
turn it around tomorrow--
we'll net double.

356
00:18:49,869 --> 00:18:52,987
Holy shit.
-MAC: That's money talk.
-That's money talk.

357
00:18:52,987 --> 00:18:55,028
-Where did you learn
to talk like that?
- Living with Frank, man.

358
00:18:55,028 --> 00:18:56,643
I've been trying to tell you
that I'm picking up
on this stuff. 

359
00:18:56,643 --> 00:18:59,549
So, look, guys,
let's pool all of
our remaining nut together

360
00:18:59,549 --> 00:19:03,463
and turn it into
a big pile of green,
and then everybody gets a taste.

361
00:19:03,463 --> 00:19:06,347
Okay,
I didn't love
the sound of that, but, uh...

362
00:19:06,347 --> 00:19:10,751
Was it unclear?
I was talking about, like,
a huge pile of green, like,
and everyone is, like...

363
00:19:10,751 --> 00:19:12,750
-Money talk?
-...slurping that shit down.

364
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:14,407
Let's do it.

365
00:19:16,958 --> 00:19:18,486
-Bam.

366
00:19:18,555 --> 00:19:21,197
-DEE: Oh, wow. I've got a lot of questions.

367
00:19:21,197 --> 00:19:22,649
-Yeah, me, too.
- Sure, sure. Go ahead.

368
00:19:22,649 --> 00:19:26,789
Now, Charlie, did
you take... all of my money...

369
00:19:26,789 --> 00:19:30,762
...and invest it in a box
full of Teenage Mutant
Ninja Turtle Pies?

370
00:19:30,762 --> 00:19:33,883
Yes. Very good, Dennis.
Very good.
I wasn't sure you knew
what they are.

371
00:19:33,883 --> 00:19:37,243
Yeah, so these are,
like, from 1991.
These are
the original ones, right?

372
00:19:37,243 --> 00:19:40,395
- Super hard to find,
super valuable.
-Are they?

373
00:19:40,395 --> 00:19:42,666
-Oh, dude, big time. Right?
So, here's what I'm thinking.

374
00:19:42,666 --> 00:19:45,021
Could we turn
these around tonight
and make a little profit?

375
00:19:45,021 --> 00:19:47,917
Sure, but I say
we sit on them.
Maybe we eat one or two.

376
00:19:47,917 --> 00:19:51,152
- This is exactly what
I was worried about.
- Well, you're not thinking
big picture here.

377
00:19:51,152 --> 00:19:56,065
All right, loan's due.
First installment.

378
00:19:56,065 --> 00:20:00,008
And I'm armed
and I got a vest,
so don't try nothing.

379
00:20:00,008 --> 00:20:04,925
- What do you got there?
- 1991's delicious cream-filled
Teenage Mutant
Ninja Turtle Pies,

380
00:20:04,925 --> 00:20:07,578
fresh from the sewers to me.

381
00:20:07,819 --> 00:20:11,599
- Are they made from real turtle?
- Probably.

382
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:15,599
- How much you want for 'em?
- They're not for sale, Frank.

383
00:20:15,599 --> 00:20:18,384
Uh, mine... mine are for sale.

384
00:20:18,384 --> 00:20:20,720
I own some of those, and mine
are definitely for sale.

385
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,597
He has a very
minimal share, Frank.

386
00:20:23,597 --> 00:20:27,214
Market dictates
the value, Charlie.

387
00:20:27,214 --> 00:20:30,528
Well...
not when your demand

388
00:20:30,528 --> 00:20:33,993
is more than
the supply.

389
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:39,302
- Fine, I'll get 'em
somewhere else.
- Will you?

390
00:20:39,657 --> 00:20:42,573
Oh, I don't think so, Frank.

391
00:20:42,983 --> 00:20:47,804
'Cause I bought the last
remaining ones there are.

392
00:20:49,228 --> 00:20:53,885
Nice work.
And you kept it crypto.

393
00:20:53,885 --> 00:20:56,131
You should have
listened to me, Frank.

394
00:20:56,131 --> 00:20:59,780
Fine.
Name your price.

395
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:03,270
Board up that new room
and the noisy toilet,

396
00:21:03,335 --> 00:21:07,366
forgive Mac and Dennis's loan,
give Dee her apartment back,

397
00:21:07,366 --> 00:21:10,276
- and return everything
to the status quo.
- That's too big a ask.

398
00:21:10,276 --> 00:21:13,554
That's inflation, Frank.
You want the pies or not?

399
00:21:13,554 --> 00:21:17,232
Fine. Done.

400
00:21:17,497 --> 00:21:21,200
Good work, Charlie.
Thank you very much, Frank.

401
00:21:24,977 --> 00:21:27,400
I appreciate it.

402
00:21:31,972 --> 00:21:34,740
I'll be damned.

403
00:21:35,449 --> 00:21:38,681
He is good at business.

404
00:21:38,681 --> 00:21:41,025
Are you still eating the nuts?

405
00:21:41,026 --> 00:21:45,832
No.

406
00:21:45,832 --> 00:21:47,565
Costco

407
00:21:47,565 --> 00:21:51,440
Does he want to get to
the hospital or to Costco?

408
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,750
-DENNIS: Costco.
-DEE: He wants more nuts.

409
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:55,748
You know what, buddy?
I think we'll take you
to the hospital, 

410
00:21:55,748 --> 00:21:59,965
and they'll
have nuts, and you can...
you can die there.

411
00:22:04,295 --> 00:22:24,966
translate
