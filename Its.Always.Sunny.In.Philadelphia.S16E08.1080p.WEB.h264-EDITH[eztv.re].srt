1
00:00:02,281 --> 00:00:06,413
Everything looks good,
Mr. Reynolds.
Your blood work is all normal.

2
00:00:06,413 --> 00:00:08,315
Excellent. As expected, right?

3
00:00:08,315 --> 00:00:11,707
Does look like
your blood pressure's
a little high, however. Um--

4
00:00:11,707 --> 00:00:13,613
-Wait.
I have high blood pressure?

5
00:00:13,613 --> 00:00:16,401
-Well, yes, but
that's consistent
with your last visit.

6
00:00:16,401 --> 00:00:19,624
We might want
to put you on a low dose
of blood pressure medication.
-Oh...

7
00:00:19,624 --> 00:00:23,152
no.
Come on, Doc.
Pills are for old men.

8
00:00:23,152 --> 00:00:25,747
Well, we all get
to a certain age where we need--

9
00:00:25,747 --> 00:00:26,823
Do we? I don't.

10
00:00:26,823 --> 00:00:29,308
So, no. I mean, you know,
let-let's not...

11
00:00:29,308 --> 00:00:32,064
Listen, I-I can see
where you're headed with this.
Let's-let's not go there, okay?

12
00:00:32,064 --> 00:00:36,411
If I wanted my blood pressure
to be low, I would simply
command my body to make it low.

13
00:00:36,411 --> 00:00:39,295
That's really not how chronic
high blood pressure works.

14
00:00:39,295 --> 00:00:41,789
Okay, well, it is how it works
with Dennis Reynolds, okay?

15
00:00:41,789 --> 00:00:43,626
And if I'm chronically
having high blood pressure,

16
00:00:43,626 --> 00:00:47,568
it's because
I'm chronically suffering fools
who won't listen to me
when I say that I can do things.

17
00:00:47,568 --> 00:00:49,958
Uh, you know what, Doc?
It's fi...

18
00:00:49,958 --> 00:00:52,186
I'm gonna take control
of this, okay?

19
00:00:52,186 --> 00:00:55,093
Don't you worry about a thing
'cause Dennis Reynolds

20
00:00:55,093 --> 00:00:58,180
is gonna
figure this all out on his own.

21
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:00,997
MENTAL

22
00:01:22,477 --> 00:01:26,101
There we go.
Blood pressure.

23
00:01:26,101 --> 00:01:29,430
Pulse. Resting heart rate,
syncs right to the phone.

24
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:32,717
And it records everything.
This is perfect.

25
00:01:32,717 --> 00:01:37,026
Now I'll have proof I can smash
in that stupid doctor's face.

26
00:01:41,711 --> 00:01:43,740
-Yeah.
- Oh, hey, Dennis.

27
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:46,415
- Uh, a-are we above
or below sea level?
-What?

28
00:01:46,415 --> 00:01:47,882
- Tell him about
the family-style cooking.

29
00:01:47,882 --> 00:01:52,422
Yeah, so we're doing
some family-style cooking now,
and we got this,
like, industrial-grade
pressure cooker.

30
00:01:52,422 --> 00:01:55,957
Pretty badass, man,
but, you know,
we got to make sure
we're above sea level
just to be safe.

31
00:01:55,957 --> 00:01:58,805
Well, we can't be
below sea level.
Otherwise, we'd be underwater.

32
00:01:58,805 --> 00:02:01,120
But if it's under sea level,
it may explode.

33
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,962
-That's our big worry.
That this sucker's
gonna explode.

34
00:02:02,962 --> 00:02:04,598
You can't take
a pressure cooker under the sea.

35
00:02:04,598 --> 00:02:07,608
- It's not gonna explode.
- Yeah, that's not
how pressure cookers works.

36
00:02:07,608 --> 00:02:10,847
You're telling me
that you can't bring
a pressure cooker
onto a submarine?

37
00:02:10,847 --> 00:02:12,653
How do they feed
the entire U.S. Navy?

38
00:02:12,653 --> 00:02:14,712
-They don't pressure-cook
the shit, Mac.
-Navy argument.

39
00:02:14,712 --> 00:02:17,185
-Stop! Stop! All of you, okay?

40
00:02:17,185 --> 00:02:19,786
I'm calling mental health day.

41
00:02:19,786 --> 00:02:22,546
Mental health day?
What kind
of cuckoo shit is that?

42
00:02:22,546 --> 00:02:25,365
It's a new thing.
It's like a sick day
but for your brain,

43
00:02:25,365 --> 00:02:28,377
and if somebody calls it,
you have to give it to 'em,
you can't ask any questions.

44
00:02:28,377 --> 00:02:30,578
Are you calling that?
Are you taking that for real?

45
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:33,604
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I'm calling
mental health day, okay?

46
00:02:33,604 --> 00:02:38,305
And I'm gonna drive out
to the beach...
...and spend the entire day
just staring at the ocean.

47
00:02:38,305 --> 00:02:39,638
Isn't your car in the shop?

48
00:02:39,638 --> 00:02:42,909
I'm sorry.
That's, uh, not a question
about mental health.
That's a question of logistics.

49
00:02:42,909 --> 00:02:44,120
Ah, damn it. No, you're right.

50
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:46,734
Hey, Dennis,
I'll come drive you.
I could use a beach day.

51
00:02:46,734 --> 00:02:50,883
Oh, shit. You know what?
This could be a good way
to find out whether or not
we're, uh, underwater.

52
00:02:50,955 --> 00:02:52,010
We can take
the cooker there, yeah.

53
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:55,010
No. No.
Goddamn it!
Do you hear that beeping?
That means stop.

54
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:59,120
No!
This is my mental health day,
and none of you
are a part of it.

55
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,225
Goddamn it!

56
00:03:03,642 --> 00:03:06,271
Hi.
Hi. How can I help you today?

57
00:03:06,271 --> 00:03:08,355
Uh, yeah, I have a reservation
under the name Reynolds.

58
00:03:08,355 --> 00:03:12,085
-Okay, let me check that out
for you.
-All right.

59
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:25,935
Wow. That's a lot of typing
you're having to do there.
You writing a novel?

60
00:03:25,935 --> 00:03:29,411
-Oh, I'm sorry.
We have no more vehicles
available in that class.

61
00:03:29,411 --> 00:03:30,892
No, no, no,
I made a reservation.

62
00:03:30,892 --> 00:03:32,946
Sometimes
our system double-books,

63
00:03:32,946 --> 00:03:37,638
so that's our mistake,
and we are happy
to offer you
a complimentary upgrade.
-Okay.

64
00:03:37,638 --> 00:03:42,882
This is the Tsuma EVS,
a fully-electric car
with touch screen controls,
automated steering

65
00:03:42,882 --> 00:03:44,345
made right here in America.

66
00:03:44,345 --> 00:03:47,462
Oh, these are awesome.
I've seen these.
These are really cool.

67
00:03:47,462 --> 00:03:51,300
Okay, yeah, no. I-I... I accept,
and I'll take those keys.

68
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:53,806
-There are no keys.
-Aha.

69
00:03:53,806 --> 00:03:56,795
-There's an app.
-Oh, right.

70
00:03:56,795 --> 00:03:58,631
-An app.
-Mm-hmm.

71
00:03:58,631 --> 00:04:01,225
Boy, I got tell you, I...
I, uh, I don't love that.

72
00:04:01,225 --> 00:04:03,826
I, uh, have a lot of apps
on my phone already,

73
00:04:03,826 --> 00:04:08,206
and, uh,
keys are sort of a system
that have existed for millennia.

74
00:04:08,206 --> 00:04:11,816
I don't know why we're trying
to fix that, but, uh,
yeah, no, now we got apps.

75
00:04:11,816 --> 00:04:16,207
We got... we got apps
for everything, right?
Even for things
we already had things for.

76
00:04:16,207 --> 00:04:19,120
I guess, uh, since
my blood pressure's going up,

77
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,838
really spiking here,
I'm just gonna...
I'm gonna go with it.
We're gonna download the app.

78
00:04:22,838 --> 00:04:24,548
Right? What's one more app?

79
00:04:24,548 --> 00:04:28,043
The phone is the key now.
Simple.

80
00:04:30,286 --> 00:04:33,377
This is nice.
Smooth ride, it's quiet.

81
00:04:33,377 --> 00:04:37,014
Try this
automated steering thing.

82
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:43,692
Hey.
Hey!

83
00:04:44,091 --> 00:04:46,724
That is awesome.

84
00:04:46,724 --> 00:04:51,061
Time to kick
this mental health day off
with some feel-good plant tonic.

85
00:04:51,061 --> 00:04:55,277
My good friend, Mr. Kratom.

86
00:04:55,917 --> 00:05:00,251
Uh, this stuff's gnarly
as hell, though.
I need some...
some kind of a mixer.

87
00:05:00,862 --> 00:05:04,537
Uh, Tsuma, direct me
to the nearest tea shop.

88
00:05:04,537 --> 00:05:08,935
Rerouting to Teaspoon.
Holy shit.

89
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:13,470
Tsuma, play... Roxette.

90
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:17,365
-Now playing Roxette,

91
00:05:18,256 --> 00:05:21,679
That is so cool.

92
00:05:22,846 --> 00:05:25,778
I'll just sit here
and enjoy the ride, I guess.

93
00:05:25,778 --> 00:05:28,145
This car's nailing it.

94
00:05:35,816 --> 00:05:39,157
-Hi.
Uh, one herbal tea, please.

95
00:05:39,157 --> 00:05:42,185
-Which flavor?
- Flavor.
Uh, I don't know. Jasmine?

96
00:05:42,185 --> 00:05:46,842
- Uh, sorry, I meant for the boba.
- The little spheres
of, uh, tapioca and sugar?

97
00:05:46,842 --> 00:05:48,751
The tea comes with boba.

98
00:05:48,751 --> 00:05:53,215
Well, it doesn't
because I see the tea
right there,
and I see the boba over there,

99
00:05:53,215 --> 00:05:55,312
so why don't we just
not combine 'em, yeah?

100
00:05:55,312 --> 00:05:58,983
-You know, so, I'll take the tea
without the covert diabetes
delivery mechanism, please.

101
00:05:58,983 --> 00:06:02,929
-The system won't
let me do that.

102
00:06:05,068 --> 00:06:09,076
Okay. Yeah. No, fine.
One boba, please.

103
00:06:09,076 --> 00:06:10,963
We'll call it
a mental health day treat.

104
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:15,145
Self-care, right?
Isn't that what people call it
whenever they need an excuse to
do whatever the fuck they want?

105
00:06:15,145 --> 00:06:18,012
-I don't know.
-Yeah, I know.
Of course you don't.
Of course you don't.

106
00:06:18,012 --> 00:06:19,556
One chewy sugar tea, please.

107
00:06:19,556 --> 00:06:22,999
All right.
Uh, you can scan the code.

108
00:06:23,271 --> 00:06:26,691
- Uh, why?
- Because the code takes you
to the app.

109
00:06:26,691 --> 00:06:30,539
That's two apps today, yeah.
Got apps for everything,
you know?

110
00:06:30,628 --> 00:06:33,901
Even though I'm already
talking to the person
that, uh, could just
take my order right here,

111
00:06:33,901 --> 00:06:35,715
but I got to download an app,
right?

112
00:06:35,791 --> 00:06:40,138
How about this?
I have cash, you have tea.

113
00:06:40,138 --> 00:06:41,507
Why don't
we just streamline things?

114
00:06:41,507 --> 00:06:43,444
We don't take cash, though.

115
00:06:43,444 --> 00:06:45,739
Yeah. How about cards?
Take cards?

116
00:06:45,739 --> 00:06:47,431
-Uh, yes.
-Oh, great.

117
00:06:47,431 --> 00:06:50,683
But there is
a ten-dollar minimum.

118
00:06:53,003 --> 00:06:56,228
There's no minimum
on the app, though.

119
00:06:59,218 --> 00:07:02,066
Sorry. It's, uh...
It's not your fault.

120
00:07:02,066 --> 00:07:03,627
You know, you didn't
create the system.

121
00:07:03,627 --> 00:07:07,360
The system is just...
It is what it is,
and, yeah, we're
both victims here, so...

122
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,982
- What?
- Uh, nothing.

123
00:07:10,982 --> 00:07:13,729
Two boba teas, please.

124
00:07:28,035 --> 00:07:29,779
-Oh, shit.

125
00:07:56,966 --> 00:07:59,078
That is rough.

126
00:08:03,145 --> 00:08:05,122
It's so sweet.

127
00:08:06,084 --> 00:08:08,461
Good, though. It's good.

128
00:08:08,461 --> 00:08:10,933
-What do you mean,
"Key not found"?

129
00:08:10,933 --> 00:08:13,817
Key not found?
Th-There is no key.
The key is my...

130
00:08:14,123 --> 00:08:15,858
...phone.

131
00:08:16,274 --> 00:08:18,806
Where's my phone?
Where's my phone?

132
00:08:20,212 --> 00:08:22,884
Goddamn it, where's my phone?

133
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:28,802
Ah, shit. Ugh! Yes. What?

134
00:08:28,802 --> 00:08:30,485
-Hey, Dennis. Hey, man.

135
00:08:30,485 --> 00:08:34,147
Hey, uh, real quick.
You know that French dip
of yours in the fridge.
Can we eat that?

136
00:08:34,147 --> 00:08:38,456
No, that French dip has been
in the fridge for a month, dude.
Do not eat it
and do not call me!

137
00:08:38,456 --> 00:08:39,936
-We already ate it.
-Yeah, we ate it.

138
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:41,786
-It's been eaten.
-I told 'em not to eat it.

139
00:08:41,786 --> 00:08:45,884
Dee tried to tell us
not to eat it, but look, anyway,
we're just calling now so
you don't get mad at us later.

140
00:08:45,884 --> 00:08:48,902
-Yeah, we're hoping
that you get mad out there
and then you come back
and you're happy.

141
00:08:48,902 --> 00:08:51,560
Do not expect that sandwich
when you get back,
'cause it's gone, okay?

142
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,764
But don't worry about it.
It has been pressure-cooked.

143
00:08:53,764 --> 00:08:56,989
-Yeah, we pressure-
cooked the shit out of it.
-What do you mean?
No, you cannot pressure-cook
a French dip.

144
00:08:56,989 --> 00:09:00,954
Oh, yeah, you can, and
I guarantee that the U.S. Navy
-is down on their submarine...
-Don't. Don't talk!

145
00:09:00,954 --> 00:09:04,121
-Don't talk. Don't. Stop.
No more phone calls! No more!

146
00:09:11,564 --> 00:09:13,802
Fantastic.

147
00:09:18,495 --> 00:09:21,796
- Hello, Officer.
- License and registration.

148
00:09:21,796 --> 00:09:24,131
-Uh, well, this is a rental,
actually.
-Hmm.

149
00:09:24,243 --> 00:09:26,145
-Turn the car off.

150
00:09:26,793 --> 00:09:31,579
Yeah.
I, uh... I can't
because I don't have a key.

151
00:09:31,579 --> 00:09:36,946
Uh, well, technically
there is no key.
My phone is the key, and...

152
00:09:36,946 --> 00:09:39,104
I don't have a phone.

153
00:09:39,104 --> 00:09:41,487
Step out of the car, sir.

154
00:09:41,487 --> 00:09:45,751
Uh, you know,
I'd really rather not
because I'm afraid if I get out,
then, um,

155
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:47,859
I'm not gonna be able
to start the car again.

156
00:09:47,859 --> 00:09:50,690
Sir, out of the car, please.

157
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:53,830
Right. You don't care.

158
00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:56,250
All right, stepping out.

159
00:10:07,358 --> 00:10:10,986
Well,
who could've predicted that?

160
00:10:14,138 --> 00:10:15,469
Hi. Good afternoon.

161
00:10:15,469 --> 00:10:16,922
Fine,
and you? Thanks for asking.

162
00:10:16,922 --> 00:10:20,639
Listen, my name is
Dennis Reynolds,
and I'm on a family plan
under the name Frank Reynolds,

163
00:10:20,702 --> 00:10:22,072
and I need a new phone, please.

164
00:10:22,072 --> 00:10:25,148
- Okay, I can help you
with that here.
- Great.

165
00:10:25,148 --> 00:10:27,513
-Frank Reynolds, mm-hmm.

166
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:32,817
-My name's not that long.

167
00:10:32,817 --> 00:10:35,534
-So, looks like I can get you
a replacement phone here.

168
00:10:35,534 --> 00:10:38,001
Can have it to you
by end of day tomorrow.

169
00:10:38,001 --> 00:10:40,191
Uh, no, that's-that's not
gonna work. I need it today.

170
00:10:40,191 --> 00:10:44,010
Unfortunately, the phones are
at our warehouse, so...

171
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:47,907
Tell me about those,
'cause those look like phones.

172
00:10:47,907 --> 00:10:50,067
Those aren't the phones.
-Those aren't the phones?
-No.

173
00:10:50,067 --> 00:10:53,152
Hey, those aren't
the phones, guys, so,
you know, just so you know.

174
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:55,995
Those are just boxes
filled with phones
that aren't the phones.

175
00:10:55,995 --> 00:10:59,420
-Phones for new customers.
-Oh, for new customer, right.
Not for old customers.

176
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:03,130
Not for the paying customers,
the people who have been paying
for months and months,
for years and years
and years and years.

177
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:06,531
Let's punish those people
and give the phones
that are right there
to the new customers.

178
00:11:06,531 --> 00:11:07,917
It's just how the system works.

179
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:11,226
-Yeah, well, mm, that system.
I've been
running up against it all day.

180
00:11:11,226 --> 00:11:16,256
Well, I'll tell you what, pal.
I am not mad at you, okay?
I am mad at the system.

181
00:11:16,256 --> 00:11:20,578
Okay, but unfortunately
the system isn't here
for me to direct my frustrations
at it, s...

182
00:11:26,132 --> 00:11:29,682
Good. Let's try something else.

183
00:11:29,917 --> 00:11:33,863
Um, what if we add a new line
to the Frank Reynolds
family plan?

184
00:11:33,863 --> 00:11:35,036
Would that make me
a new customer?

185
00:11:35,036 --> 00:11:36,937
Yeah, I can do that.
I just need your PIN.

186
00:11:36,937 --> 00:11:41,122
Right, 'cause the PIN's the key
to the phone,
and the phone's the key
to the car,
and everything's been
streamlined.

187
00:11:41,197 --> 00:11:44,343
Excuse me, please. I need
to make a call on my watch.

188
00:11:44,343 --> 00:11:48,308
-Are you sure
this is gonna work?
-Charlie,
diamonds are made
under pressure.

189
00:11:48,308 --> 00:11:52,163
This is a pressure cooker.
We're going to cook diamonds.
It's very linear.

190
00:11:52,163 --> 00:11:53,050
-So genius.

191
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:56,783
I just can't believe no one's
ever thought of this before.
We're gonna be rich, man.
- Oh, I know.

192
00:11:56,783 --> 00:11:59,355
- It's Dennis.
- Oh, oh, oh, oh,
do not answer it.

193
00:11:59,355 --> 00:12:01,837
-It's a mental health day test.
-A test. Mm.

194
00:12:01,837 --> 00:12:05,489
-Test?
In my day, if you wanted
to get out of work,

195
00:12:05,489 --> 00:12:10,173
you hit yourself with a hammer
or you got gnawed by a shark
or something simple.

196
00:12:10,173 --> 00:12:14,016
-No, not gonna pick up now.
No, wh-wh-why would he?
Unreal.

197
00:12:14,084 --> 00:12:18,467
Uh, let's try... 69-69.

198
00:12:18,467 --> 00:12:20,645
Okay.

199
00:12:20,645 --> 00:12:22,613
-Yeah, that's it.
-That worked?

200
00:12:22,613 --> 00:12:23,668
You're all set.

201
00:12:23,668 --> 00:12:25,012
-Seriously?
-That's it.

202
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:26,390
-This is the phone?
-That's the phone.

203
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:29,262
I'm gonna open the box,
I'm gonna turn it on,
the phone's going to work?

204
00:12:29,262 --> 00:12:31,468
Yup.
It's gonna work.
It's your phone.

205
00:12:34,258 --> 00:12:36,490
Why won't you talk
to each other?!

206
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:42,906
Talk! Talk! Talk! Talk!
Talk! Talk!

207
00:12:42,906 --> 00:12:44,558
Dennis Reynolds.

208
00:12:44,558 --> 00:12:47,506
D, E, "N" as in Nancy...

209
00:12:47,506 --> 00:12:53,022
License plate-- "B" as in boy,
SX355.

210
00:12:57,736 --> 00:12:59,198
I'm sorry. I didn't get that.

211
00:12:59,198 --> 00:13:02,502
Yeah, no, I know you didn't
get it 'cause I didn't say it.
I didn't say what it was.

212
00:13:02,502 --> 00:13:03,996
Did you say "January"?

213
00:13:03,996 --> 00:13:07,706
No, I didn't say "January."
I didn't say anything.
I didn't give a month,
I didn't give a day.

214
00:13:07,706 --> 00:13:09,804
Representative.
No, representative.

215
00:13:09,804 --> 00:13:11,889
Human! Human!

216
00:13:15,513 --> 00:13:19,537
D,
E, "N" as in "neighbor,"

217
00:13:19,537 --> 00:13:21,389
I, S.

218
00:13:21,389 --> 00:13:22,457
Dennis Reynolds.

219
00:13:22,457 --> 00:13:24,454
"D" as in
"Deliver me from this!"

220
00:13:24,454 --> 00:13:26,096
-"E" as in "Engage with human."

221
00:13:26,096 --> 00:13:27,865
"N" as in "nightmare"!

222
00:13:27,865 --> 00:13:30,064
"N" as in "nightmare"!

223
00:13:30,064 --> 00:13:32,900
"I" as in "Is this real?!"

224
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:35,692
"S" as in "Somebody help me!"

225
00:13:35,692 --> 00:13:38,020
There has to be a way
to open this goddamn car!

226
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:40,151
How do I open the car?!

227
00:13:41,482 --> 00:13:43,579
Dennis Reynolds.

228
00:13:43,753 --> 00:13:46,891
D, E,

229
00:13:46,891 --> 00:13:50,002
"N" as in "never-ending."

230
00:13:50,002 --> 00:13:52,725
Thank you for calling
Tsuma Customer Care.

231
00:13:52,725 --> 00:13:56,955
Your call is
very important to us.
Please enter your 17-digit VIN.

232
00:13:58,608 --> 00:14:02,232
- Please say your name.
-Dennis Reynolds.

233
00:14:02,232 --> 00:14:04,781
-Got it. Let me transfer you.

234
00:14:06,506 --> 00:14:09,274
Thank you
for calling Tsuma Customer Care.
My name is Daisy.

235
00:14:09,274 --> 00:14:11,296
May I please
have your name and 17-digit VIN?

236
00:14:11,296 --> 00:14:14,818
No. No, no, no, no. No.
I just ent... I ju...

237
00:14:14,818 --> 00:14:18,955
I just entered all that
information into the system.

238
00:14:18,955 --> 00:14:23,041
- I'm sorry, sir.
I get it, but I do--
- That-That's okay. No, no.
That's okay. Daisy, was it?

239
00:14:23,041 --> 00:14:26,069
Listen, don't be sorry, okay?
I'm not mad at you.

240
00:14:26,069 --> 00:14:28,933
I'm a little upset, but I'm
upset at the situation, okay?

241
00:14:28,933 --> 00:14:33,127
And-and the situation is this,
Daisy.
If you'll just give me a second
and indulge me, okay?

242
00:14:33,127 --> 00:14:36,771
My new phone won't talk
to my car.

243
00:14:36,771 --> 00:14:41,142
Okay, so I called
the car rental company,
and they put me on
with a supervisor

244
00:14:41,142 --> 00:14:43,672
who told me
to call Tsuma Roadside,
so I called Tsuma Roadside.

245
00:14:43,672 --> 00:14:47,763
Spoke to someone over there
who put me on
with another supervisor
who told me
to call the service center.

246
00:14:47,763 --> 00:14:51,825
So I called the service center,
spoke to about--
I don't know--
two, three morons over there

247
00:14:51,825 --> 00:14:53,344
who had no answers
for me whatsoever.

248
00:14:53,344 --> 00:14:57,837
They put me on
with one of their supervisors,
and that person told me to call
the car rental company again.

249
00:14:57,837 --> 00:15:01,762
So I called
the car rental company,
then roadside, service center,
rental company,

250
00:15:01,762 --> 00:15:04,923
roadside, service center,
rental company,
roadside, service center,

251
00:15:04,923 --> 00:15:07,152
and around and around
and around like that
for hours and hours,

252
00:15:07,152 --> 00:15:10,797
until finally someone had
the presence of mind
to let me know there's
a goddamn customer care line.

253
00:15:10,797 --> 00:15:12,524
Okay, so I called
the customer care line

254
00:15:12,524 --> 00:15:14,949
and now I find myself talking
to you, Daisy,

255
00:15:14,949 --> 00:15:16,578
my little wildflower.

256
00:15:16,578 --> 00:15:20,422
And you ask me
to enter in my VIN
and my date of birth again,

257
00:15:20,422 --> 00:15:23,739
information which I already
entered into your system.

258
00:15:23,739 --> 00:15:27,985
Okay, now, now, listen,
Daisy, Daisy,
bear with me here, okay?

259
00:15:27,985 --> 00:15:32,824
I know you didn't create
the system, okay?
So you are not to blame.

260
00:15:32,824 --> 00:15:35,078
But somebody did create
the system,

261
00:15:35,078 --> 00:15:37,737
and I would very much like
to blame that person.

262
00:15:37,737 --> 00:15:42,025
- So... who is that?
- Sir, I'm sorry. Who is...?

263
00:15:42,025 --> 00:15:45,888
Who is the person who created
your customer service system
in such a way

264
00:15:45,888 --> 00:15:51,189
that the information entered
into the computer
isn't passed on
to the human representative?!

265
00:15:51,189 --> 00:15:53,248
Sir, I don't know. I can send
you to one of my supervisors.

266
00:15:53,248 --> 00:15:56,152
No, no, no, no, no.
No, Dai... no.
No, don't send me
to a supervisor, Daisy.

267
00:15:56,152 --> 00:15:59,817
Daisy, Daisy...
it's just you and me.

268
00:15:59,817 --> 00:16:03,257
Just you and me, Daisy,
fighting the good fight
against a broken system

269
00:16:03,257 --> 00:16:05,936
engineered
to drive us both so crazy

270
00:16:05,936 --> 00:16:10,700
that we have to take days off
for our mental health!

271
00:16:12,789 --> 00:16:15,225
- Daisy?
- Yes?

272
00:16:15,225 --> 00:16:18,100
The Tsuma.
It's made in America, right?

273
00:16:18,133 --> 00:16:19,469
Yes, it is.

274
00:16:19,503 --> 00:16:21,172
Where?

275
00:16:33,063 --> 00:16:35,334
Yup. Great, wonderful.

276
00:16:35,367 --> 00:16:36,737
All right, yes, okay. Yup.

277
00:16:36,770 --> 00:16:39,342
Oh, let me call you back.

278
00:16:41,747 --> 00:16:44,052
Hello. How are you?

279
00:16:44,085 --> 00:16:46,122
I've been better.

280
00:16:48,159 --> 00:16:50,130
I've been worse.

281
00:16:50,163 --> 00:16:52,134
Is the CEO in?

282
00:16:52,167 --> 00:16:53,805
I'm sorry. Uh, who are you?

283
00:16:53,838 --> 00:16:56,376
Dennis Reynolds.

284
00:16:56,409 --> 00:17:00,184
D, E, "N" as in "Nancy,"
N, I, S.

285
00:17:00,217 --> 00:17:02,756
Tsuma customer for, uh,

286
00:17:02,789 --> 00:17:06,162
oh, six hours and 17 minutes.

287
00:17:06,195 --> 00:17:08,534
I have some helpful feedback

288
00:17:08,567 --> 00:17:10,538
that I would very much like
to pass on to your boss.

289
00:17:12,474 --> 00:17:15,314
Can I get you a water
or something?

290
00:17:15,347 --> 00:17:17,653
Listen, I have traveled

291
00:17:17,686 --> 00:17:20,391
through blistering sun
and pouring rain to get here,

292
00:17:20,424 --> 00:17:22,461
so, if you don't mind,
I'll just wait.

293
00:17:22,495 --> 00:17:25,401
Uh, he is not in the office

294
00:17:25,434 --> 00:17:27,271
this week,

295
00:17:27,304 --> 00:17:29,677
but customer feedback
is very important to him,

296
00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:33,317
so, if you'd like
to leave him a message,

297
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:35,522
I'll make sure he gets it.

298
00:17:39,195 --> 00:17:41,600
If I leave you a message,

299
00:17:41,633 --> 00:17:44,205
can you assure me

300
00:17:44,238 --> 00:17:46,644
that you will get this to him?

301
00:17:46,677 --> 00:17:48,848
Absolutely.
I'll make sure he gets it

302
00:17:48,881 --> 00:17:51,452
when he gets back
from the beach house.

303
00:17:56,730 --> 00:17:59,168
-The beach, huh?
-Mm-hmm.

304
00:17:59,201 --> 00:18:01,238
-Yeah.

305
00:18:02,007 --> 00:18:04,178
I was supposed
to go to the beach today.

306
00:18:04,211 --> 00:18:05,849
-That's nice.
-Yeah.

307
00:18:05,882 --> 00:18:08,186
-How about that, huh?

308
00:18:11,493 --> 00:18:14,398
Which beach?

309
00:18:23,751 --> 00:18:26,757
Brandon, dinner's ready!

310
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:41,185
Hi.

311
00:21:06,442 --> 00:21:08,013
This is a medical marvel.

312
00:21:08,046 --> 00:21:10,417
You lowered your blood pressure

313
00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:13,658
by 20 points
in less than a minute, but how?

314
00:21:13,691 --> 00:21:16,697
Well, just let off
a little steam, all naturally.

315
00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:18,701
Told you, Dr. Tsuma.

316
00:21:20,103 --> 00:21:22,909
Oh. Excuse me.

317
00:21:22,942 --> 00:21:24,680
Hello?

318
00:21:24,713 --> 00:21:26,449
Oh, hey, Dennis.

319
00:21:26,482 --> 00:21:28,521
Uh, are-are we above
or below sea level?

320
00:21:28,554 --> 00:21:30,591
I'll be right in.
