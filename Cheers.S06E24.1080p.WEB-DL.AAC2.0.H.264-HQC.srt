1
00:00:01,261 --> 00:00:05,241
<i>Cheers is filmed
before a live studio audience.</i>

2
00:00:09,568 --> 00:00:11,814
Oh, Fras.

3
00:00:11,814 --> 00:00:13,688
You make it
home okay last night, buddy?

4
00:00:13,722 --> 00:00:15,590
Yeah, thanks for putting me
in that cab.

5
00:00:15,624 --> 00:00:20,106
I figured
you had a little too much
when you started making fun
of that longshoreman's mother.

6
00:00:20,326 --> 00:00:23,872
Oh, Lord,
I don't remember a thing.
What-what did I say?

7
00:00:23,872 --> 00:00:25,333
Something like, uh,

8
00:00:25,434 --> 00:00:29,921
"Unions are for mommy's boys
who can't get their own jobs,"
I think.

9
00:00:29,955 --> 00:00:32,289
Oh, why didn't he kill me?

10
00:00:32,324 --> 00:00:36,535
Well, you-you said
you wanted to wait and
take him on when
there were more people here.

11
00:00:36,872 --> 00:00:39,848
So, uh,
you said you'd meet the guy
back here today,

12
00:00:39,882 --> 00:00:43,317
about, uh, right about
now, actually.

13
00:00:43,351 --> 00:00:46,788
No, wait. Whoa, whoa.
The guy couldn't make it!

14
00:00:47,856 --> 00:00:50,037
Whoop, there he is.

15
00:00:50,692 --> 00:00:54,228
No, no, no, no, no.
That's just a car.

16
00:00:56,599 --> 00:01:00,851
Okay, why are you taunting me
like some sort of play thing?

17
00:01:00,886 --> 00:01:04,171
It's just my little
hangover cure.

18
00:01:04,205 --> 00:01:05,773
Didn't help me a bit.

19
00:01:05,808 --> 00:01:08,545
No, but mine's gone completely.

20
00:01:13,716 --> 00:01:16,319
¶ Making your way
in the world today ¶

21
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:19,270
¶ Takes everything you've got.

22
00:01:19,304 --> 00:01:22,106
¶ Taking a break
from all your worries ¶

23
00:01:22,141 --> 00:01:24,934
¶ Sure would help a lot.

24
00:01:25,243 --> 00:01:29,510
¶ Wouldn't you like

25
00:01:31,083 --> 00:01:33,451

¶ And they're always glad
you came ¶

28

29
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:48,465

30
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:53,284
¶ You want to be where everybody
knows your name ¶

31
00:01:53,422 --> 00:01:56,273
¶ You want to go

32
00:01:56,308 --> 00:01:58,633

34
00:02:21,668 --> 00:02:24,001
- How you doing, Woody?
- Fine.

35
00:02:24,036 --> 00:02:25,570
Is that a new shirt?

36
00:02:25,604 --> 00:02:28,901
- You mean the one I'm wearing?
- Yes.

37
00:02:29,107 --> 00:02:30,736
You look very nice today.

38
00:02:30,736 --> 00:02:32,484
Very... cute.

39
00:02:32,559 --> 00:02:35,947
Really?
You...
You mean it? Me?

40
00:02:35,947 --> 00:02:38,601
I mean,
me... you think me look cute?

41
00:02:38,601 --> 00:02:41,149
Well, I did.

42
00:02:44,156 --> 00:02:46,558
Hey, fella.

43
00:02:46,558 --> 00:02:49,961
- You a little sweet
on Rebecca there, huh?
- Nah, get out.

44
00:02:49,961 --> 00:02:53,742
No, come on. You've got that
kind of dopey look.

45
00:02:53,965 --> 00:02:57,084
Hey, get over here.
You can tell us, come on.

46
00:02:57,084 --> 00:03:01,142
Well...
okay.

47
00:03:01,142 --> 00:03:04,361
Uh, last couple of months,
I have kind of noticed her.

48
00:03:04,361 --> 00:03:08,611
In fact, if it weren't
for Mr. Drake,
I really might go after her.

49
00:03:08,646 --> 00:03:10,715
- Come on, Woody.
- Hey, hey, that's
good, Woody, good.

50
00:03:10,749 --> 00:03:12,183
What's so funny?

51
00:03:12,218 --> 00:03:16,183
No disrespect,
Rhinestone Cowpie.

52
00:03:17,539 --> 00:03:20,107
But I really don't think
her idea of a hot date

53
00:03:20,141 --> 00:03:23,511
is a butter-churning contest
in Tobacci-flats.

54
00:03:23,511 --> 00:03:26,586
Hey, you're forgetting
something.
Miss Howe said I was cute.

55
00:03:26,586 --> 00:03:29,261
Yeah, but, Woody, I think
she thinks you're cute,

56
00:03:29,261 --> 00:03:31,675
kind of like
she thinks a puppy dog is cute.

57
00:03:31,675 --> 00:03:33,745
Yeah, I know.

58
00:03:33,745 --> 00:03:36,246
Hey, is that a cut?

59
00:03:38,312 --> 00:03:41,556
Oh, so you guys
really don't think
she'd go for me, huh?

60
00:03:41,556 --> 00:03:43,181
I may just have to show you.

61
00:03:43,215 --> 00:03:44,898
You couldn't get to first base.

62
00:03:44,898 --> 00:03:48,354
First base, nothing.
I can hit a home run with her.

63
00:03:49,238 --> 00:03:51,712
- You can't hit a home run.
- Can so.

64
00:03:51,712 --> 00:03:54,399
In fact, by midnight tonight,
I can get a kiss.

65
00:03:54,399 --> 00:03:58,178
A kiss, huh?
That-that what you meant
by home run?

66
00:03:58,178 --> 00:04:01,722
Yeah, sure.
What else could it be?

67
00:04:03,752 --> 00:04:05,562
I thought you meant
go all the way.

68
00:04:05,562 --> 00:04:07,827
You mean marry her?

69
00:04:09,324 --> 00:04:12,467
Sam, where is your mind?

70
00:04:13,532 --> 00:04:15,498
All right.
Wait a minute now.

71
00:04:15,498 --> 00:04:17,611
I got ten bucks says
Woody can get that kiss.

72
00:04:17,611 --> 00:04:20,040
Come on.
Will you stop it, Norm?

73
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:25,274
I mean, Woody's got
about as much chance
of getting a kiss out of Rebecca
as Sammy here.

74
00:04:25,274 --> 00:04:28,152
Hey, whoa, wait, listen,
sure, Woody can't do it,

75
00:04:28,152 --> 00:04:29,611
but you think
I can't come through?

76
00:04:29,611 --> 00:04:33,772
You know, rumor has it, Sam,
that, uh, the woman finds you
utterly repulsive.

77
00:04:34,366 --> 00:04:37,337
Rumor? Heck, it's
in the newsletter.

78
00:04:37,969 --> 00:04:40,137
Hey, would you guys give me
a break?

79
00:04:40,172 --> 00:04:43,223
You're talking to Sammy here.
I am the king.

80
00:04:43,258 --> 00:04:46,352
Well, when was the last time
that Rebecca said you were cute?

81
00:04:46,352 --> 00:04:49,514
Yeah, yeah, Sam.
Might be time
to hang up those lips, buddy.

82
00:04:49,548 --> 00:04:52,020
Hey, no, no, no.
Hey, listen, I still got it.

83
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:53,953
And if you need proof,
then fine.

84
00:04:53,953 --> 00:04:57,965
I will get that kiss from her,
and before Woody, too.

85
00:04:57,965 --> 00:05:02,091
Oh, yeah?
Well, there's an expression
we used to have back in Indiana.

86
00:05:02,091 --> 00:05:03,939
Same to you.

87
00:05:05,297 --> 00:05:09,613
All right, all right.
I got ten bucks on Woody, huh?

88
00:05:09,613 --> 00:05:11,137
Me, too.

89
00:05:11,137 --> 00:05:13,621
I'll put, uh, 20 bucks down
on the kid.

90
00:05:13,656 --> 00:05:15,105
You're putting 20 on Woody?

91
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:17,855
Uh, you're right,
Sammy, make that 50.

92
00:05:17,855 --> 00:05:20,011
Come on,
you're putting me on here.

93
00:05:20,011 --> 00:05:22,133
No,
Sammy. I mean,
look at that face.

94
00:05:22,133 --> 00:05:24,648
Okay? That sweet, innocent face.

95
00:05:24,682 --> 00:05:28,746
The kind of face we
all hate and resent,
but we will cash in on it.

96
00:05:28,746 --> 00:05:32,253
Okay, all right.
You know, I'm going
to teach you doubters a lesson.

97
00:05:32,253 --> 00:05:33,654
I'm gonna take all bets.

98
00:05:33,654 --> 00:05:36,362
Okay, let's set
the ground rules here.

99
00:05:36,662 --> 00:05:39,147
A kiss before midnight tonight.

100
00:05:39,147 --> 00:05:43,147
It's got to be a full one
on the lips,
all four lips touching.

101
00:05:43,147 --> 00:05:46,407
For an entire...
three count.

102
00:05:46,407 --> 00:05:49,056
Wait, wait, wait, but, uh,
there's got to be a
bona fide witness.

103
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:50,208
No, I'll do it, I'll do it.

104
00:05:50,242 --> 00:05:54,077
You know, I think
this is gonna be better
than our contest
for the biggest spit bubble.

105
00:05:54,112 --> 00:05:55,635
Hey, well, it's possible.

106
00:05:55,635 --> 00:05:56,911
Explain this to me.

107
00:05:56,911 --> 00:06:00,602
If, uh, the winner is gonna
get a kiss from Rebecca,
what does the loser get?

108
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,866
a kiss from Norm.

109
00:06:04,657 --> 00:06:07,965
Then, of course,
there is no loser.

110
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:15,861
So, when are we gonna
see some action?

111
00:06:15,861 --> 00:06:18,263
Oh, what are you worried about?
I got all day here.

112
00:06:18,263 --> 00:06:20,138
I'll see you guys.

113
00:06:20,255 --> 00:06:23,026
Anyway, I got this sewn up.

114
00:06:23,026 --> 00:06:25,706
I don't know, Sammy.
I'm on your side,

115
00:06:25,706 --> 00:06:28,543
but you know, a lot
of women come into this bar

116
00:06:28,543 --> 00:06:30,573
wanting to meet
the sexy bartender,

117
00:06:30,573 --> 00:06:33,217
and more and more of them
are not talking about you.

118
00:06:33,251 --> 00:06:34,685
Hey, wait, wait, wait.

119
00:06:34,719 --> 00:06:37,469
Listen, you're not losing
faith in me here, are you?

120
00:06:37,469 --> 00:06:39,509
I mean, you-you still think.
I-I got it, don't you?

121
00:06:39,509 --> 00:06:43,627
Sure I do,
but you know,
you can't take this thing
for granted.

122
00:06:43,662 --> 00:06:47,608
Get a little older,
you got to work harder,
or date uglier.

123
00:06:50,761 --> 00:06:54,262
Well, you know,
come to think of it,
Woody is kind of cute, isn't he?

124
00:06:54,262 --> 00:06:58,075
Oh, this is not good.
This is not good
for my image at all.

125
00:06:58,109 --> 00:06:59,698
I mean, if I let Woody win here,

126
00:06:59,698 --> 00:07:03,922
then every young punk
with a pair of lips is
gonna be challenging me.

127
00:07:04,349 --> 00:07:07,885
All right, I got a way
to go here.
Watch this.

128
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:12,055
Hey, hey, these go to table six.
And you owe 'em some change.

129
00:07:16,462 --> 00:07:18,362
Hey, boss.

130
00:07:18,397 --> 00:07:21,562
- What, are you doing inventory?
- That's right.

131
00:07:21,627 --> 00:07:23,430
Boy, you know, it
is getting warmer.

132
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:27,936
Maybe we ought to be ordering
some more rum and...

133
00:07:29,014 --> 00:07:30,868
Sam?

134
00:07:31,109 --> 00:07:33,604
Oh, my God, are you all right?

135
00:07:33,505 --> 00:07:36,547
No. Not that.

136
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:39,844
- Mouth-to-mouth.
- Are you sure?

137
00:07:39,844 --> 00:07:42,470
Mouth-to-mouth.
All right.

138
00:07:42,503 --> 00:07:44,889
Oh, God, does anybody know
mouth-to-mouth?

139
00:07:44,923 --> 00:07:47,255
I do, I do, I do.

140
00:07:50,062 --> 00:07:52,264
It's okay, I'm all right,
I'm all right.

141
00:07:52,264 --> 00:07:55,291
Works every time.

142
00:08:02,907 --> 00:08:07,075
<i>Low, Sammy, real low.
Not worthy of the king.</i>

143
00:08:07,075 --> 00:08:09,977
Entering Nick Tortelli country.

144
00:08:10,549 --> 00:08:13,889
King Woody.
It does have a ring to it.

145
00:08:13,889 --> 00:08:16,353
Yeah, say it Sam,
see what you think.

146
00:08:16,387 --> 00:08:18,512
King Woody.

147
00:08:19,491 --> 00:08:21,372
Your Grace.

148
00:08:25,313 --> 00:08:29,400
- Afternoon, Woody.
- Oh, yeah, hi.

149
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,652
Are you okay?

150
00:08:31,687 --> 00:08:34,569
Oh, yeah, sure. Great.

151
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:37,511
Oh, you wouldn't want
to know anyway.

152
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:39,108
Well, of course I would.

153
00:08:39,108 --> 00:08:41,278
- Really?
- Very much.

154
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:42,697
You sure? Yes.

155
00:08:42,697 --> 00:08:46,835
- Honestly?
- When was the last time
someone actually struck you?

156
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:52,539
Well, see, I'm, uh, trying out
for this part in a play.

157
00:08:52,573 --> 00:08:55,592
It's a really important part,
and it's a really
well-known play. Uh,

158
00:08:55,626 --> 00:08:56,944
<i>Bus Station.</i>

159
00:08:56,978 --> 00:08:58,612
<i>You mean Bus Stop?</i>

160
00:08:58,646 --> 00:09:01,207
I'll never get it.

161
00:09:03,219 --> 00:09:06,147
This is great.
He's gonna be so worried
about his dumb play,

162
00:09:06,147 --> 00:09:08,156
he's probably gonna
forget all about the bet.

163
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:11,720
At least his memory loss
isn't from senility.

164
00:09:12,994 --> 00:09:16,167
Gee, I'm so glad you're
on my side, Carla.

165
00:09:16,698 --> 00:09:18,916
See, the thing is,
the audition's tomorrow,

166
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:22,569
and I don't have
a chance to work
with any of the other actors
to prepare my part.

167
00:09:22,604 --> 00:09:25,131
Actors have to do that,
you know.

168
00:09:25,131 --> 00:09:28,946
Say, Miss Howe,
do you think maybe
you could read with me?

169
00:09:28,946 --> 00:09:32,546
Oh, gee, Woody, I'm sorry.
I-I'm really busy
with this inventory.

170
00:09:32,581 --> 00:09:34,732
Oh, yeah, sure, I understand.

171
00:09:34,732 --> 00:09:37,316
I'll just lose the part.

172
00:09:37,658 --> 00:09:41,989
All right, Woody.
But you have to promise
to make it quick.

173
00:09:42,023 --> 00:09:43,698
Thanks, Miss Howe.

174
00:09:43,698 --> 00:09:47,113
Hey, I hope you don't mind,
it's a love scene.

175
00:09:48,463 --> 00:09:51,989
Did you hear that?
Love scene.

176
00:09:56,276 --> 00:09:58,529
Love scene!

177
00:09:59,453 --> 00:10:04,346
Sometimes
the little hamster
falls asleep in the wheel.

178
00:10:14,392 --> 00:10:16,033
Okay, if you could
just sit here.

179
00:10:16,058 --> 00:10:18,629
All right, Woody,
but I'm expecting
a beer distributor
in five minutes.

180
00:10:18,629 --> 00:10:19,375
No problem.

181
00:10:19,375 --> 00:10:22,276
Sell it, make me believe it.

182
00:10:22,276 --> 00:10:25,350
Carla?
- Well, it really helps
when you have an audience.

183
00:10:25,384 --> 00:10:27,643
Is there gonna be any nudity?

184
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,852
Not unless you're planning
something repugnant.

185
00:10:31,852 --> 00:10:34,088
All right, so
what are we doing here?

186
00:10:34,088 --> 00:10:38,420
Okay. The scene is between
a wayward, young,
rodeo buff, Bo...

187
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:39,405
that'd be me...

188
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:42,375
and, uh, the sexy showgirl,
Cherie.

189
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:44,242
That's you, I guess.

190
00:10:45,304 --> 00:10:47,071
So where do we start?

191
00:10:47,105 --> 00:10:50,412
Uh, right here before
it says, "They kiss."

192
00:11:01,069 --> 00:11:04,074
Oh, oh, golly.

193
00:11:05,816 --> 00:11:09,263
When you kiss
someone for serious,
it's kind of scary, ain't it?

194
00:11:09,263 --> 00:11:10,911
Yeah, it is.

195
00:11:10,945 --> 00:11:13,158
Now I'm supposed to kiss you.

196
00:11:14,049 --> 00:11:17,268
Sorry, I, uh,
hope I'm not interrupting
anything here.

197
00:11:17,303 --> 00:11:18,782
What is it, Sam?

198
00:11:19,747 --> 00:11:22,435
Uh... we're out of vermouth.

199
00:11:22,241 --> 00:11:24,556
So order more.

200
00:11:24,609 --> 00:11:27,262
Uh, is that okay?
Yes, if we're out of it.

201
00:11:27,296 --> 00:11:29,480
- We are.
- Then order more.

202
00:11:29,514 --> 00:11:32,321
- Vermouth?
- Yeah! Sam,

203
00:11:32,321 --> 00:11:34,847
would you
excuse us, please?

204
00:11:39,307 --> 00:11:41,775
Okay, where were we? Uh...

205
00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:43,628
Wait.

206
00:11:43,662 --> 00:11:47,197
Oh, oh, golly.

207
00:11:48,434 --> 00:11:52,284
When you kiss
someone for serious,
it's kind of scary, ain't it?

208
00:11:52,284 --> 00:11:54,362
Yeah, it is.

209
00:11:54,473 --> 00:11:58,516
Sorry, I, uh...
I wouldn't interrupt like this
except it's important.

210
00:11:58,524 --> 00:12:00,507
What is it, Sam?

211
00:12:00,879 --> 00:12:03,497
I ordered the vermouth.

212
00:12:04,384 --> 00:12:08,832
Sam,
would you get out of here?
We're right in the
middle of a scene.

213
00:12:08,832 --> 00:12:11,589
Oh, a play!
Oh, I love good dramatic stuff.

214
00:12:11,623 --> 00:12:14,091
What is this, uh,
Tennessee Ernie Ford?

215
00:12:14,126 --> 00:12:16,740
Sam, get out.

216
00:12:16,871 --> 00:12:20,774
Come on.
Play fair.

217
00:12:21,284 --> 00:12:22,988
Play fair?

218
00:12:22,988 --> 00:12:25,622
That's my opinion
of the play so far,

219
00:12:25,622 --> 00:12:28,870
but with enough rehearsal,
it might play great.

220
00:12:31,076 --> 00:12:33,945
- Okay, let's pick it up.
- All right.

221
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:38,304
Oh. Oh, golly.

222
00:12:38,961 --> 00:12:42,336
When you kiss someone for serious,
it's kind of scary, ain't it?

223
00:12:42,336 --> 00:12:44,241
Yeah, it is.

224
00:12:44,623 --> 00:12:46,486
Wait a minute.

225
00:12:46,486 --> 00:12:49,227
I just ordered two cases
of vermouth yesterday!

226
00:12:49,261 --> 00:12:51,040
Sam's crazy.

227
00:13:03,929 --> 00:13:06,694
Better make that move, Sammy.
Time's getting short.

228
00:13:06,728 --> 00:13:11,274
No, this is how I like it.
Late innings, game on the line.

229
00:13:11,274 --> 00:13:14,310
The cool character
steps to center stage.

230
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:17,705
Well, I don't know, Sammy.
You seem to be sweating
a little bit up there.

231
00:13:17,739 --> 00:13:18,606
No, I'm not.

232
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:21,292
Yeah, that's okay.
Nothing wrong with sweating.

233
00:13:21,326 --> 00:13:23,728
I, myself, have perspired
once or twice.

234
00:13:23,762 --> 00:13:26,161
We could grow rice.

235
00:13:30,502 --> 00:13:32,403
Oh, watch this.

236
00:13:32,437 --> 00:13:34,705
Say, Rebecca.

237
00:13:34,739 --> 00:13:36,549
Oh, excuse me for a minute.

238
00:13:36,549 --> 00:13:40,377
Caroline, are you all right?
You look kind of depressed.

239
00:13:40,412 --> 00:13:43,614
- Oh, Sam, it's
the same old thing.
- What?

240
00:13:43,648 --> 00:13:48,202
I'm so in love
with my boss, and I
just can't get him to notice me.

241
00:13:48,236 --> 00:13:50,941
Well, have you tried
kissing him like this?

242
00:13:56,678 --> 00:13:58,926
Oh, my God.

243
00:13:58,926 --> 00:14:02,416
That was...
That was...

244
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:04,569
Oh, thank heaven
you showed it to me.

245
00:14:04,603 --> 00:14:07,855
There's no way anyone could
possibly describe it.

246
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:11,914
If I kiss him like that,
he's bound to fall
in love with me.

247
00:14:11,914 --> 00:14:13,427
Bye, Sam.

248
00:14:13,461 --> 00:14:16,955
Bye-bye.
You two have a great honeymoon.

249
00:14:17,099 --> 00:14:19,366
Thank you so much.

250
00:14:19,401 --> 00:14:21,836
Anything to get
my disc player back.

251
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:23,539
Hey, hey, hey...

252
00:14:26,975 --> 00:14:29,080
By the way, Rebecca,

253
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:32,379
<i>how are things between
you and your boss?</i>

254
00:14:32,414 --> 00:14:35,299
Anything, uh, I can do?

255
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:38,011
These lips remind
you of anything?

256
00:14:40,121 --> 00:14:43,675
Yeah, I think the liver
in my freezer's gone bad.

257
00:14:47,095 --> 00:14:48,495
What happened?

258
00:14:48,529 --> 00:14:52,455
She couldn't possibly
have seen through
your little morality play.

259
00:14:55,571 --> 00:14:57,204
What's going on here?

260
00:14:57,239 --> 00:14:59,896
Whatever do you mean?

261
00:14:59,896 --> 00:15:03,627
Sam and Woody are trying
desperately to kiss me.

262
00:15:03,662 --> 00:15:07,639
Boy, someone's a little full
of herself, isn't she?

263
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:11,636
Come on, Carla.
What's the story here?
One woman to another.

264
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:16,974
Why would I tell you something
about my two closest best
friends in the whole world?

265
00:15:17,008 --> 00:15:20,183
- I'll give you a paid day off.
- They got a bet.

266
00:15:20,681 --> 00:15:24,099
They want to see who
could kiss you
by the end of the shift tonight.

267
00:15:24,174 --> 00:15:27,326
Why would they do such an
asinine, juvenile, thing?

268
00:15:27,326 --> 00:15:29,581
Look at the contestants.

269
00:15:30,021 --> 00:15:33,123
Actually,
Woody's doing it 'cause
they were razzing him.

270
00:15:33,158 --> 00:15:35,025
Sam's trying to prove
he still got it.

271
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:36,760
Other than that,
just cheap thrills.

272
00:15:36,828 --> 00:15:39,297
Don't tell them I know.

273
00:15:39,331 --> 00:15:42,864
Wait a minute.
You're not cooking up something

274
00:15:42,864 --> 00:15:46,169
that's going
to humiliate my friends
and make them
look stupid, are you?

275
00:15:46,204 --> 00:15:49,054
Well, yeah.
How can I help?

276
00:15:56,298 --> 00:15:58,699
Oh, Miss Howe?
Can I ask you a question?

277
00:15:58,733 --> 00:16:00,711
Sure, Woody.
What do you want to know?

278
00:16:00,797 --> 00:16:03,907
Um... which key unlocks
the storage room?

279
00:16:03,968 --> 00:16:06,240
I don't know.
Hold it still.

280
00:16:06,275 --> 00:16:10,057
Look carefully, very carefully.

281
00:16:10,462 --> 00:16:14,576
You're getting sleepy.
Very sleepy.

282
00:16:14,576 --> 00:16:19,537
- Woody?
- Very, very, sleepy.

283
00:16:19,571 --> 00:16:22,893
You'll do whatever I say.

284
00:16:23,342 --> 00:16:26,039
Woody, go to sleep.

285
00:16:36,205 --> 00:16:39,638
Oh, no. I made her disappear.

286
00:16:45,747 --> 00:16:49,652
To recap,
sitting in the bar today,
we have, among others,

287
00:16:49,652 --> 00:16:52,902
a man who was actually simple
enough to hypnotize himself.

288
00:16:52,902 --> 00:16:56,641
I'd like to offer the suggestion
that we've seen it all.

289
00:16:56,892 --> 00:16:59,068
Ten hut!

290
00:17:01,546 --> 00:17:04,080
Happily, I stand corrected.

291
00:17:05,901 --> 00:17:09,169
Well, it's time for me
to be all that I can be.

292
00:17:11,874 --> 00:17:15,157
You enlisted in
the Army, you idiot?

293
00:17:15,157 --> 00:17:20,138
Hey, we do more by 9:00 a.m.
than most people do all day.

294
00:17:20,498 --> 00:17:23,265
And that's a
selling point to you?

295
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:29,144
Yeah, and I've had a bellyful
of that Ayatolah guy.

296
00:17:29,144 --> 00:17:33,161
Quite frankly...
I don't like what's been
happening in the Persian Gulf.

297
00:17:33,195 --> 00:17:36,896
So, I'm off to, uh...
I'm off to Persia.

298
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:42,041
I just wanted to shake
a few hands, say good-bye.

299
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:45,001
Kiss a few girls
for the last time.

300
00:17:45,001 --> 00:17:49,138
Well, baby...
this is good-bye.

301
00:17:49,138 --> 00:17:52,924
Yep, this may be
the last time
you ever see this dogface.

302
00:17:52,924 --> 00:17:55,972
You can always take
a gander at this one.

303
00:17:57,419 --> 00:18:00,859
Sam, I had no idea you
were this dedicated.

304
00:18:00,859 --> 00:18:04,514
- This is a wonderful thing
you're doing for our country.
- Well, thank you.

305
00:18:04,584 --> 00:18:07,447
Kiss me, Sam, kiss me.

306
00:18:08,145 --> 00:18:12,400
No, I can't kiss
another soldier.
Not after Kevin.

307
00:18:13,423 --> 00:18:15,269
Kevin? Who-who's Kevin?

308
00:18:15,304 --> 00:18:17,704
Kevin was my boyfriend
in high school,
and we really loved each other,

309
00:18:17,739 --> 00:18:20,674
and then
he enlisted in the Army,
and I never wrote,
and I never saw him again.

310
00:18:20,708 --> 00:18:22,476
Well, he sounds like a creep.
Kiss me and make him jealous.

311
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:24,378
No, Sam, I'm sorry.

312
00:18:26,347 --> 00:18:29,549
Come home safely, doughboy.

313
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:34,889
Damn!
I mean, what does it take?!

314
00:18:34,923 --> 00:18:38,360
Well, maybe
you're being too subtle.

315
00:18:39,344 --> 00:18:40,879
One hour.

316
00:18:40,879 --> 00:18:44,515
I don't think
either of you heartthrobs
got the lips to win.

317
00:18:44,549 --> 00:18:47,401
Serves you right
if you lose, Sam,
doing all that weird stuff.

318
00:18:47,435 --> 00:18:51,505
Me? What about you?
You-you and that acting routine.

319
00:18:51,505 --> 00:18:54,592
You know something, Woody,
I'm getting a little
sick and tired of you.

320
00:18:54,626 --> 00:18:58,679
You and your wholesome
farm boy bit.
You're not so dumb.

321
00:18:58,713 --> 00:19:00,914
I resent that.

322
00:19:02,408 --> 00:19:06,468
You're just upset because
you're not king of the hill.
Well, that's too bad.

323
00:19:06,468 --> 00:19:10,924
And I'll tell you another thing.
I'm thinking about not writing
you when you're overseas.

324
00:19:10,959 --> 00:19:13,507
Oh, break my heart.

325
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:17,847
Sam?
Can I speak with you a moment?

326
00:19:17,882 --> 00:19:19,854
You sure can.

327
00:19:28,679 --> 00:19:31,879
- Yeah?
- Sam, I know what you
and Woody are up to.

328
00:19:31,913 --> 00:19:34,081
- I-I don't know what you're
talking about.
- I want you to win.

329
00:19:34,115 --> 00:19:35,002
What?

330
00:19:35,002 --> 00:19:38,275
- I want you to win.
- All right!

331
00:19:38,275 --> 00:19:41,204
And they said that
I was losing it.

332
00:19:41,239 --> 00:19:44,596
Okay, so, uh, let's get on
with the dirty deed here.

333
00:19:44,596 --> 00:19:46,960
No, no, no, we have to make this
look really natural.

334
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,820
Otherwise they'll think
the kiss is a setup.

335
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:51,503
Kiss, oh, sweetheart, no, no.
Someone mislead you there.

336
00:19:51,503 --> 00:19:53,716
Uh, we're supposed
to sleep together.

337
00:19:55,164 --> 00:19:57,182
You're trying my patience.

338
00:19:57,182 --> 00:19:59,536
All right, all right;
A kiss, a kiss, okay.

339
00:19:59,536 --> 00:20:01,354
Uh... so, uh, how do
you want to do this?

340
00:20:01,354 --> 00:20:03,722
All right, here's the plan.
You go home and change.

341
00:20:03,722 --> 00:20:07,781
And I'll tell the others
I'm really beat
and I have to go in
and take a nap in my office.

342
00:20:07,815 --> 00:20:09,393
And you come back and wake me,

343
00:20:09,393 --> 00:20:12,803
and I'll act like I'm having
this really erotic dream,

344
00:20:12,837 --> 00:20:14,798
and give you this long,
passionate kiss.

345
00:20:14,798 --> 00:20:17,720
Oh, God, I love this.
I love this. Oh...!

346
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:22,078
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
wait a minute. Uh...
Carla's supposed
to witness this.

347
00:20:22,113 --> 00:20:23,607
Okay, bring her along.

348
00:20:23,607 --> 00:20:27,239
Oh, and then I'll spit
and rinse my mouth out
to make it look really legit.

349
00:20:27,239 --> 00:20:29,865
Nice touch, nice touch.

350
00:20:31,433 --> 00:20:33,691
Yeah, so long there.

351
00:20:33,691 --> 00:20:35,728
Oh, wait a minute.
What do you got
on your lips there?

352
00:20:35,728 --> 00:20:37,802
Oh, no one.

353
00:20:41,983 --> 00:20:44,068
Can I talk to you a minute?

354
00:20:44,102 --> 00:20:46,685
Listen, I know
what you and Sam are up to,

355
00:20:46,752 --> 00:20:49,249
<i>and I want you to win.</i>

356
00:20:54,912 --> 00:20:57,298
Hey, Cliffie.
Hi, Sam.

357
00:20:57,332 --> 00:21:00,116
- Where is everybody?
- Oh, most have gone home.

358
00:21:00,151 --> 00:21:03,003
Carla's in the back.
Rebecca's asleep in her office.

359
00:21:03,037 --> 00:21:04,366
Rebecca's asleep?

360
00:21:04,436 --> 00:21:08,748
Yeah. She said
she was up late last night
doing the books, or something.

361
00:21:08,748 --> 00:21:11,619
Oh, yeah, she said she wanted me
to wake her up right about now.

362
00:21:11,619 --> 00:21:14,900
Better go do that. Oh, no, no,
that's, that's uh, my job.

363
00:21:16,635 --> 00:21:19,099
Want to help me here, Carla?

364
00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:53,460
¶ Sammy and Woody
sittin' in a tree ¶

365
00:21:57,058 --> 00:21:58,959
You were supposed
to be Miss Howe.

366
00:21:58,993 --> 00:22:00,911
That's a rotten thing you did.

367
00:22:00,945 --> 00:22:03,929
Don't talk to me about rotten.
What about
all this kissing nonsense?

368
00:22:04,025 --> 00:22:06,850
Yeah, that's different.
There's money involved.

369
00:22:07,719 --> 00:22:11,698
Well, I am going to say this
once and once only.

370
00:22:11,698 --> 00:22:15,627
I am a person
who cannot be used.

371
00:22:15,627 --> 00:22:21,260
Now if you'll excuse me,
I've got to drive Mr. Drake's
valet to the airport.

372
00:22:27,005 --> 00:22:29,037
Call me a romantic,

373
00:22:29,037 --> 00:22:32,372
but I always knew you two
would end up together.

374
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:38,651
<i>I can't believe I kissed you.</i>

375
00:22:38,933 --> 00:22:41,286
Yeah, well, you're lucky
I didn't punch
your lights out, man.

376
00:22:41,286 --> 00:22:42,702
Yeah? You and what army?

377
00:22:42,737 --> 00:22:45,089
Hey, hey, hey, guys.
Come on, now.

378
00:22:45,123 --> 00:22:46,791
Relax.

379
00:22:46,825 --> 00:22:50,160
Geez, you guys,
you were tricked.
It's no big deal.

380
00:22:50,194 --> 00:22:53,981
I mean,
you're such good friends.
You mean a lot to each other.

381
00:22:54,015 --> 00:22:58,424
I mean, don't walk away mad.
Go on, kiss and make up.

382
00:23:01,256 --> 00:23:04,630
Remember,
you both owe me a big wet one.

383
00:23:21,642 --> 00:23:25,645
Ah, I couldn't stay mad
at you, Sam.
You're just like
a brother to me.

384
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:30,333
Yeah, and if anyone ever does
knock off the king around here,

385
00:23:30,368 --> 00:23:33,103
I guess I hope it's you, man.

386
00:23:33,137 --> 00:23:35,939
- No hard feelings?
- No hard feelings.

387
00:23:37,208 --> 00:23:40,794
Listen, Sam,
now that everything's okay,
can I ask you something,
guy to guy?

388
00:23:40,794 --> 00:23:42,384
Yeah, sure.

389
00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:45,210
How was I?

390
00:23:50,555 --> 00:23:52,254
Don't-don't do that.

391
00:23:52,355 --> 00:23:54,254
No, I mean it's a question
you can't ask a girl.

392
00:23:54,254 --> 00:23:55,826
I mean, is there anything
I need to work on?

393
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:59,304
No, see, I-I don't want
to talk about this, Woody.

394
00:24:00,397 --> 00:24:03,299
I was nervous, so I might
have been a little dry.

395
00:24:03,334 --> 00:24:05,309
Oh, for God's...! Yech!

396
00:24:05,309 --> 00:24:06,966
No, I'm serious, Sam.

397
00:24:06,966 --> 00:24:09,622
Hey, do you want to know
how you were?

398
00:24:09,623 --> 00:24:29,623
translate
