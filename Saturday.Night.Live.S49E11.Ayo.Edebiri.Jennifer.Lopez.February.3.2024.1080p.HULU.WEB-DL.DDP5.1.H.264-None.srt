1
00:00:02,183 --> 00:00:04,817
>>> AND NOW THE CNN TRUMP TOWN
HALL

2
00:00:04,817 --> 00:00:07,803
LIVE FROM COLUMBIA, SOUTH
CAROLINA.

3
00:00:09,984 --> 00:00:12,127
>>> HELLO, EVERYONE.

4
00:00:12,127 --> 00:00:15,753
HELLO, HELLO, HELLO, AND WELCOME
TO SOUTH CAROLINA.

5
00:00:15,753 --> 00:00:18,541
WE ARE YOUR HOSTS TONIGHT.
I'M CHARLES BARKLEY.

6
00:00:18,603 --> 00:00:21,648
>> AND I AM GAYLE KING.

7
00:00:21,648 --> 00:00:24,627
AND WE'RE THE COHOSTS OF A REAL
CNN SHOW

8
00:00:24,627 --> 00:00:28,340
THAT COMBINES OUR TWO
NAMES, KING CHARLES.

9
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:31,985
>> YEAH.
I THOUGHT IT SHOULD BE GAY BAR.

10
00:00:31,985 --> 00:00:35,085
BUT THEN I WAS TOLD THAT THAT
WAS TERRIBLE.
>> YES.

11
00:00:35,085 --> 00:00:39,900
TONIGHT, THE PEOPLE OF SOUTH
CAROLINA WILL ASK FORMER
PRESIDENT TRUMP QUESTIONS

12
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:42,507
ABOUT
IMPORTANT ISSUES AFFECTING THEIR
LIVES.

13
00:00:42,507 --> 00:00:47,168
>> AND I'LL ASK MYSELF QUESTIONS
LIKE CAN YOU BET ON A TOWN HALL.

14
00:00:47,168 --> 00:00:50,188
YOU SURE CAN ON FANDUEL.

15
00:00:50,188 --> 00:00:53,692
>> NOW, PLEASE WELCOME THE
FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED
STATES.

16
00:00:53,692 --> 00:00:56,785
>> HE'S BEEN AROUND THE COURT
MORE THAN ME, AND I WAS IN THE
NBA.

17
00:00:56,785 --> 00:00:58,961
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP.

18
00:00:58,961 --> 00:01:00,891
>> THANK YOU, THANK YOU.

19
00:01:00,891 --> 00:01:05,086
THANK YOU VERY MUCH TO THE FEW
OF YOU WHO ARE APPLAUDING.

20
00:01:05,086 --> 00:01:08,094
I LOVE BEING HERE IN THE GREAT
STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA.

21
00:01:08,094 --> 00:01:10,014
FRANKLY ONE OF THE TOP TWO
CAROLINAS.

22
00:01:10,014 --> 00:01:13,439
SOUTH CAROLINA, THE FIRST STATE
TO SECEDE FROM THE UNION,

23
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:15,398
AND
NOT THE LAST, I THINK.

24
00:01:15,398 --> 00:01:18,739
GOING TO SEE A LOT OF THAT WHEN
I WIN.
50 STATES IS WAY TOO MANY.

25
00:01:18,739 --> 00:01:22,344
I THINK WE COULD GET IT BACK
DOWN TO 12 OR 13 AGAIN.

26
00:01:22,592 --> 00:01:25,538
>> WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU TALKING
ABOUT, MAN?

27
00:01:25,538 --> 00:01:29,430
THAT'S THE DUMBEST THING I'VE
HEARD, AND I WORK WITH SHAQ.

28
00:01:29,942 --> 00:01:34,225
>> OUR FIRST QUESTION TONIGHT
COMES FROM AN AUTO WORKER

29
00:01:34,225 --> 00:01:36,202
AT THE
ASSEMBLY PLANT FOR VOLVO.

30
00:01:36,202 --> 00:01:40,424
VOLVO. WHICH IS ALSO THE MEDICAL
TERM FOR HOO-HA.

31
00:01:41,539 --> 00:01:45,481
>> PRESIDENT TRUMP, I VOTED FOR
YOU IN 2016 AND 2020.

32
00:01:45,562 --> 00:01:48,452
>> WOW, YOU FELL FOR IT TWICE.

33
00:01:48,452 --> 00:01:51,808
>> WHAT MAKES YOU THINK YOU CAN
DEFEAT JOE BIDEN THIS TIME?

34
00:01:51,808 --> 00:01:55,888
>> WELL, I THINK I'M DOING EVEN
BETTER THIS TIME IN TERMS OF
HISPANIC.

35
00:01:55,888 --> 00:01:59,388
I LIKE TO SAY I PUT THE PANIC IN
HISPANIC.

36
00:01:59,388 --> 00:02:03,054
PEOPLE ARE SICK OF HAVING AN
ALLEGED CRIMINAL

37
00:02:03,054 --> 00:02:04,994
LIKE JOE BIDEN
IN THE WHITE HOUSE.

38
00:02:04,994 --> 00:02:07,045
THEY WANT A CONVICTED CRIMINAL.

39
00:02:07,045 --> 00:02:10,686
SOMEONE THEY CAN TRUST TO GET
THE CRIMES DONE RIGHT.

40
00:02:10,686 --> 00:02:13,179
>> SOMEHOW THAT'S WHAT I WANTED
TO HEAR.
THANK YOU.

41
00:02:13,179 --> 00:02:15,845
>> YOU KEEP DOING YOU, HOMEY.

42
00:02:15,845 --> 00:02:20,828
>> YEAH.
NEXT WE HAVE A SINGLE MOM WHO'S
CURRENTLY UNEMPLOYED.

43
00:02:20,828 --> 00:02:25,795
>> WOW.
GUYS ARE GOING TO BE LINING UP
AFTER THAT DESCRIPTION.

44
00:02:25,795 --> 00:02:29,190
PRESIDENT TRUMP, IF ELECTED,
WHAT WOULD YOU DO

45
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:33,436
TO STOP TAYLOR
SWIFT FROM INFILTRATING THE
SUPER BOWL AND STEALING THE
ELECTION?

46
00:02:33,436 --> 00:02:36,517
>> YOU KNOW, THANK YOU.
THAT'S ACTUALLY ONE OF THE SMARTEST

47
00:02:36,517 --> 00:02:39,682
AND MOST RESEARCHED
QUESTIONS I THINK POSSIBLY EVER.

48
00:02:39,682 --> 00:02:43,431
YOU KNOW, WE ALL KNOW THAT BIDEN
HAS BRAINWASHED TAY-TAY.

49
00:02:43,431 --> 00:02:46,047
THEY'RE USING HER IN SOMETHING CALLING CYOPS,

50
00:02:46,047 --> 00:02:50,344
WHICH STARTED WITH THE
GREAT RAPPER CY.

51
00:02:50,345 --> 00:02:52,777
NAME
FRIEND

52
00:02:52,777 --> 00:02:54,588
HE TOLD ME HE NEEDED A NEW STYLE.

53
00:02:54,588 --> 00:02:57,613
I SAID WHAT ABOUT GANGHAM.
LOVE SO MUCH

54
00:02:57,613 --> 00:03:00,369
NOW THEY'VE GOT TAY-TAY
PRETENDING TO DATE

55
00:03:00,369 --> 00:03:02,821
TRAY DAY.
TRAVIS

56
00:03:02,821 --> 00:03:04,965
TERRIBLE

57
00:03:04,965 --> 00:03:07,333
HE CAN'T EVEN GET TAYLOR TICKETS
NEAR THE FIELD.

58
00:03:07,333 --> 00:03:11,469
HE'S GOT HER WAY UP IN A LITTLE
BOX.
SO SAD.

59
00:03:11,469 --> 00:03:15,784
>> I'M SORRY.
HOW EXACTLY WILL TAYLOR SWIFT
BEING AT THE SUPER BOWL

60
00:03:15,784 --> 00:03:17,287
MAKE
BIDEN WIN THE ELECTION?

61
00:03:17,288 --> 00:03:19,089
FINISH

62
00:03:19,089 --> 00:03:22,678
>> THE CLUES ARE ALL THERE IF
YOU LOOK AT THE MIDNIGHTS TRACK
LIST.

63
00:03:22,678 --> 00:03:27,537
THE RAVENS WERE THERE BUT GOT
CAUGHT BY THE CHIEFS.

64
00:03:27,537 --> 00:03:32,829
ANTI HERO
PAUL RUDD WHO'S FROM WHERE,
KANSAS CITY.

65
00:03:32,829 --> 00:03:35,987
THE NEXT FOUR SONGS CONTAIN
EXACTLY 49 LETTERS

66
00:03:35,987 --> 00:03:38,807
PLUS E-R-S,
49ers.

67
00:03:38,808 --> 00:03:42,181
VIGILANTE

68
00:03:42,181 --> 00:03:43,935
THOSE

69
00:03:43,935 --> 00:03:48,721
IT WILL BE KARMA FOR SWEET
NOTHING, AKA, BIDEN'S BRAIN,

70
00:03:48,721 --> 00:03:53,263
THAT THE MASTERMIND BEHIND IT
ALL WILL OF COURSE BE BARACK
HUSSEIN OBAMA.

71
00:03:53,263 --> 00:03:56,464
THAT ALL ADDS UP TO, ,

72
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:02,079
ANOTHER STOLEN
ELECTION, TAYLOR'S VERSION.

73
00:04:02,279 --> 00:04:04,644
>> MY GOD.

74
00:04:04,644 --> 00:04:08,471
I WAS SKEPTICAL AT FIRST, BUT
NOW IT ALL MAKES SENSE.

75
00:04:08,471 --> 00:04:12,026
>> OUR NEXT QUESTION COMES FROM
SOMEONE WHO SAYS

76
00:04:12,026 --> 00:04:15,653
HE REALLY,
REALLY LIKES PRESIDENT TRUMP
TIMES A MILLION.

77
00:04:15,653 --> 00:04:18,566
SOUTH CAROLINA SENATOR, TIM
SCOTT.

78
00:04:18,566 --> 00:04:22,398
>> HEY, DONALD, IT'S ME.
YOUR BEST FRIEND, TIM SCOTT.

79
00:04:22,398 --> 00:04:25,725
I FLEW ALL THE WAY TO NEW
HAMPSHIRE TO ENDORSE YOU.
REMEMBER?

80
00:04:25,725 --> 00:04:27,813
>> VAGUELY.

81
00:04:27,813 --> 00:04:30,613
>> I DON'T HAVE A QUESTION.
I HAVE A STATEMENT.

82
00:04:30,613 --> 00:04:35,423
I WOULD LIKE TO SAY YOU ARE THE
BESTEST MOST HANDSOMEST
PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE I'VE EVER
SEEN.

83
00:04:35,423 --> 00:04:38,204
I LOOK AT YOU AND THINK, IS THAT
HOT LINCOLN?

84
00:04:38,204 --> 00:04:41,557
>> THAT'S A LITTLE MUCH EVEN FOR
ME.

85
00:04:41,557 --> 00:04:45,612
TIM SCOTT, EVERYBODY.
HE'S A LOT LIKE SCOTT TOILET
PAPER.

86
00:04:45,612 --> 00:04:48,199
THERE'S NOT MUCH THERE, YOU CAN
SEE RIGHT THROUGH IT,

87
00:04:48,199 --> 00:04:50,453
BUT IT'S
BETTER THAN NOTHING.

88
00:04:50,453 --> 00:04:53,343
>> OKAY.
OUR NEXT QUESTION COMES FROM SOMEONE

89
00:04:53,343 --> 00:04:57,015
WHO DESCRIBES HERSELF AS
A CONCERNED SOUTH CAROLINA
VOTER.

90
00:04:57,015 --> 00:04:59,737
>> YES.
HELLO.

91
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:05,799
MY QUESTION IS WHY WON'T YOU
DEBATE NIKKI HALEY?

92
00:05:05,799 --> 00:05:07,974
>> OH, MY GOD.
IT'S HER.

93
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:11,455
THE WOMAN WHO WAS IN CHARGE OF
SECURITY ON JANUARY 6th.

94
00:05:11,535 --> 00:05:13,894
IT'S NANCY PELOSI.

95
00:05:13,894 --> 00:05:18,561
>> FOR THE 100th TIME, THAT IS
NOT NANCY PELOSI.

96
00:05:18,692 --> 00:05:20,351
IT IS NIKKI HALEY.

97
00:05:20,351 --> 00:05:24,510
>> ARE YOU DOING OKAY, DONALD?
YOU MIGHT NEED A MENTAL
COMPETENCY TEST.

98
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:26,978
>> I TOOK THE TEST AND I ACED
IT.

99
00:05:26,978 --> 00:05:29,482
PERFECT SCORE.
THEY SAID I'M 100% MENTAL.

100
00:05:29,482 --> 00:05:32,284
I'M CONFIDENT BECAUSE I'M A MAN.

101
00:05:32,284 --> 00:05:34,511
THAT'S WHY WOMEN SHOULD NEVER
RUN OUR ECONOMY.

102
00:05:34,511 --> 00:05:36,148
MONEY

103
00:05:36,148 --> 00:05:41,446
A WOMAN I KNOW ASKED ME FOR
$83.3 MILLION.

104
00:05:41,851 --> 00:05:45,590
>> AND YOU SPENT $50 MILLION IN
YOUR OWN LEGAL FEES.

105
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:46,964
DO YOU NEED TO BORROW SOME
MONEY?

106
00:05:46,964 --> 00:05:49,960
>> OH, NIKKI, DON'T DO THIS.

107
00:05:49,961 --> 00:05:51,962
NOCKI

108
00:05:51,962 --> 00:05:55,100
NIKKI, DON'T LOSE THAT NUMBER.
NIKKI HALEY

109
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:57,792
JOEL OSMENT
NIKKI HALEY JOEL OSMENT WE CALL
HER.

110
00:05:57,792 --> 00:06:01,219
REMEMBER THE SIXTH SENSE?
I SEE DEAD PEOPLE.

111
00:06:01,219 --> 00:06:05,505
>> THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE WILL SAY
IF THEY SEE YOU AND JOE ON THE
BALLOT.

112
00:06:05,505 --> 00:06:10,244
>> THAT'S NOT VERY NICE, NIKKI.
IT'S NOT NICE.

113
00:06:10,244 --> 00:06:14,915
AND I'M ALWAYS VERY NICE TO YOU
EXCEPT FOR WHEN I'M IMPLYING YOU
WEREN'T BORN IN THIS COUNTRY,

114
00:06:14,915 --> 00:06:19,682
EVEN THOUGH YOU'RE FROM SOUTH
CAROLINA AND NOW I'M GOING TO
BEAT YOU IN YOUR STATE.

115
00:06:19,682 --> 00:06:22,754
>> AND DID YOU WIN YOUR HOME
STATE IN THE LAST ELECTION?

116
00:06:22,754 --> 00:06:25,633
>> I WON STATEN ISLAND

117
00:06:25,633 --> 00:06:28,842
AND THE PARTS OF LONG ISLAND WHERE THE
FIST FIGHTS HAPPEN,

118
00:06:28,842 --> 00:06:31,665
WHERE THEY
GET OUT OF THE CARS IF YOU HONK
AT THEM.

119
00:06:31,665 --> 00:06:34,072
I LOVE MY WORLD STAR WHITES.

120
00:06:34,072 --> 00:06:38,136
>> ALL RIGHT.
WELL, THAT IS A NEW ONE ON ME.

121
00:06:38,136 --> 00:06:40,700
OKAY.
WE HAVE TIME FOR ONE MORE QUESTION,

122
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:43,853
AND IT'S ACTUALLY FOR
AMBASSADOR HALEY.

123
00:06:51,125 --> 00:06:55,962
>> I WAS JUST CURIOUS, WHAT
WOULD YOU SAY WAS THE MAIN CAUSE
OF THE CIVIL WAR,

124
00:06:55,962 --> 00:07:00,343
AND DO YOU
THINK IT STARTS WITH AN S AND
ENDS WITH A LAVERY?

125
00:07:00,893 --> 00:07:03,739
>> YEP.
I PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE SAID THAT
THE FIRST TIME,

126
00:07:03,739 --> 00:07:07,150
AND LIVE FROM
NEW YORK, IT'S SATURDAY NIGHT.

127
00:09:13,087 --> 00:09:17,966
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, AYO
EDEBIRI!

128
00:09:38,152 --> 00:09:41,941
THANK YOU VERY MUCH!

129
00:09:41,941 --> 00:09:46,216
MY NAME IS AYO EDEBIRI, AND I AM
SO EXCITED TO BE HERE.

130
00:09:46,216 --> 00:09:48,669
SNL MEANS SO MUCH TO ME.

131
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,299
THIS REALLY IS A DREAM COME
TRUE.

132
00:09:56,605 --> 00:09:58,644
I WAS BORN AND RAISED IN BOSTON,

133
00:09:58,644 --> 00:10:02,510
WHICH MAKES ME THE FIRST BLACK
WOMAN TO EVER ADMIT THAT.

134
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:07,019
YEAH.
THREE DAYS INTO FEBRUARY, AND
I'M ALREADY MAKING BLACK
HISTORY.

135
00:10:07,019 --> 00:10:10,605
BUT I WAS RAISED IN BOSTON BY AN
IMMIGRANT FAMILY.

136
00:10:10,605 --> 00:10:13,000
WE ARE BOTH AFRICAN AND CARIBBEAN,

137
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,614
SO YOU KNOW WHAT THAT
MEANS, I'M IN THERAPY.

138
00:10:16,614 --> 00:10:20,185
THERE WERE A LOT OF HIGH
EXPECTATIONS FOR ALL OF US.

139
00:10:20,185 --> 00:10:24,279
A LOT OF MY COUSINS ARE DOCTORS
AND LAWYERS AND PROFESSORS,

140
00:10:24,279 --> 00:10:27,426
SO
WHILE THEY WERE BUSY SAVING
LIVES AND TEACHING CHILDREN,

141
00:10:27,426 --> 00:10:29,387
I WAS DOING SOMETHING EQUALLY
NOTABLE,

142
00:10:29,387 --> 00:10:33,380
STANDUP ECONOMIC SHOWS
IN THE BACK OF LAUND RO MATS.

143
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:39,569
BUT NOW I'M PROUD TO SAY I'M THE
COUSIN WHO MADE THE BIGGEST TURNAROUND,

144
00:10:39,569 --> 00:10:42,778
AND NO MATTER WHAT
HAPPENS, I WILL ALWAYS HAVE THE APPROVAL

145
00:10:42,778 --> 00:10:48,006
OF ALL NIGERIAN AUNTS
AND UNCLED ACROSS THE WORLD ON WHAT'S APP.

146
00:10:49,682 --> 00:10:53,837
SOME OF YOU MAY KNOW ME FROM A
SHOW CALLED THE BEAR.

147
00:10:56,212 --> 00:10:59,858
IT'S ABOUT THE KITCHEN STAFF AT
A CHICAGO RESTAURANT.

148
00:10:59,858 --> 00:11:01,758
AND IT'S SUCH A FUN SHOW TO WORK
ON.

149
00:11:01,758 --> 00:11:04,951
BUT WHEN I GOT CAST, I WAS TOLD
THERE WAS GOING TO BE A LOT OF
RESEARCH.

150
00:11:04,951 --> 00:11:08,576
BEFORE SHOOTING THE FIRST
SEASON, WE ALL HAD TO WORK IN
ACTUAL RESTAURANTS

151
00:11:08,576 --> 00:11:10,760
SO WE COULD
CAPTURE THAT KITCHEN ENERGY.

152
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:14,491
WHEN PEOPLE SAW MY COSTAR JEREMY
ALLEN WHITE WORKING IN A RESTAURANT,

153
00:11:14,491 --> 00:11:19,398
THEY THOUGHT, HE
MUST BE PREPARING FOR A ROLE, SO
METHOD.

154
00:11:19,398 --> 00:11:24,817
WHEN THEY SAW ME, THEY WOULD BE
LIKE, HOW MUCH LONGER FOR MY
TILAPIA.

155
00:11:24,817 --> 00:11:28,738
BEFORE ALL THIS, I WAS A STANDUP
COMIC IN NEW YORK CITY.

156
00:11:28,739 --> 00:11:31,990
OPEN MIKES

157
00:11:33,004 --> 00:11:36,578
FIRST EVER ROUND OF APPLAUSE FOR
OPEN MICS.

158
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:41,149
BUT I REALLY ALWAYS WANTED TO DO
THE SHOW, AND I JUST HAD SO MANY
IDEAS.

159
00:11:41,149 --> 00:11:45,784
I ACTUALLY ONCE WROTE A PACT,
BUT I DIDN'T REALLY HAVE THE
NERVE TO SUBMIT IT AND I PRINTED
IT OUT.

160
00:11:45,784 --> 00:11:49,053
IS IT OKAY IF I SHARE SOME
STUFF?

161
00:11:49,584 --> 00:11:52,884
OH, MY GOD.
THIS IS TAKING ME BACK.

162
00:11:52,884 --> 00:11:55,631
YEAH.
THIS ONE, I SEE RIGHT HERE.

163
00:11:55,631 --> 00:11:58,075
YOU GUYS KNOW THAT SKETCH BLACK
JEOPARDY?

164
00:11:58,075 --> 00:12:01,032
SO I WANTED TO DO A SKETCH
CALLED WHITE JEOPARDY

165
00:12:01,032 --> 00:12:05,027
WHICH
DIDN'T WORK BECAUSE IT WAS JUST
WHITE PEOPLE PLAYING JEOPARDY.

166
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:08,974
AND THIS ONE, JUST --

167
00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:11,388
I LOVE A CHARACTER WITH A CATCH PHRASE,

168
00:12:11,388 --> 00:12:14,985
YOU KNOW, LIKE CATCH PHRASES
WORK BECAUSE ANYBODY CAN SAY
THEM AND GET A BIG REACTION,

169
00:12:15,046 --> 00:12:18,407
AND
THIS ONE WAS HOP ON TO IT NOW.

170
00:12:18,718 --> 00:12:21,801
IT'S NOT BAD.
IT'S NOT THE WORST.
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

171
00:12:21,801 --> 00:12:24,171
ANYONE CAN SAY IT, A CAST
MEMBER, A HOST.

172
00:12:24,171 --> 00:12:27,853
JUST IMAGINE KENAN BEING LIKE,
HOP ON TO IT NOW, YOU KNOW?

173
00:12:27,853 --> 00:12:31,416
OR THE QUEEN OF ENGLAND JUST BEING LIKE,

174
00:12:31,416 --> 00:12:34,499
HOP ON TO IT NOW.

175
00:12:34,855 --> 00:12:38,072
TRADE MARKING THAT TONIGHT.
OKAY.

176
00:12:38,072 --> 00:12:41,113
YEAH, I THINK WE'RE DONE WITH
THIS.

177
00:12:41,113 --> 00:12:43,343
BURN IT.

178
00:12:43,343 --> 00:12:47,191
GENUINELY, I AM SO EXCITED FOR
TONIGHT.

179
00:12:47,191 --> 00:12:50,824
I CAME UP IN THE NEW YORK COMEDY
SCENE WITH SOME OF MY BEST FRIENDS

180
00:12:50,824 --> 00:12:53,347
WHO I AM SO BLESSED TO
BE WORKING WITH HERE TONIGHT,

181
00:12:53,347 --> 00:12:55,934
AND IT REALLY TRULY FEELS LIKE A HOMECOMING,

182
00:12:55,934 --> 00:13:00,710
AND I THINK I'VE
BEEN UP HERE LONG ENOUGH, SO
THERE'S REALLY ONLY ONE THING TO
SAY.

183
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:02,340
LET'S HOP ON TO IT NOW.

184
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:06,665
WE'VE GOT A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU

185
00:13:06,665 --> 00:13:09,678
STICK

186
00:13:28,872 --> 00:13:31,716
TALKING

187
00:13:31,716 --> 00:13:33,674
IT'S WHY'D YOU SAY IT

188
00:13:33,674 --> 00:13:36,996
WITH YOUR HOST, DANNY DONNIGAN.

189
00:13:38,319 --> 00:13:41,468
>> HEY, THERE.
WELCOME TO WHY'D YOU SAY IT.

190
00:13:41,571 --> 00:13:45,195
TONIGHT'S CONTESTANTS ARE DANNY.
>> HEY THERE.

191
00:13:45,195 --> 00:13:48,137
>> TYLER.
>> WHAT'S UP, WORLD?

192
00:13:48,137 --> 00:13:50,557
>> AND ANNIE.
>> HI, DANNY.

193
00:13:50,557 --> 00:13:53,506
I'M NOT SURE WHAT THIS GAME IS,
BUT I'M EXCITED TO PLAY.

194
00:13:53,506 --> 00:13:55,173
>> WELL, THE GAME IS EASY.

195
00:13:55,173 --> 00:13:58,810
WE SHOW YOU A COMMENT YOU LEFT
ON INSTAGRAM

196
00:13:58,810 --> 00:14:02,840
AND ASK YOU THE
SIMPLE QUESTION, WHY'D YOU SAY
IT.

197
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:06,054
>> OH.
NO THANK YOU.

198
00:14:06,541 --> 00:14:10,032
>> AS USUAL, ONE CONTESTANT HAS
LEFT IMMEDIATELY.

199
00:14:10,032 --> 00:14:13,838
LET'S BRING IN OUR BACKUP
CONTESTANT JENNY.

200
00:14:15,506 --> 00:14:18,796
>> HEY.
EXCITED TO PLAY.

201
00:14:18,796 --> 00:14:21,773
WHAT'S THIS GAME?
>> YOU'LL FIND OUT.

202
00:14:21,773 --> 00:14:24,141
ALL RIGHT, ANNIE, LET'S START
WITH YOU.

203
00:14:24,141 --> 00:14:27,840
>> DO I HAVE TO?
>> YES!

204
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:32,394
OKAY.
DREW BARRYMORE PREVIOUSLY AND FAMOUSLY

205
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:36,328
POSTED THIS VIDEO ON
HER INSTAGRAM.

206
00:14:36,528 --> 00:14:40,478
>> WHENEVER YOU CAN GO OUT INTO THE RAIN,

207
00:14:40,478 --> 00:14:44,156
DO NOT MISS THE
OPPORTUNITY!

208
00:14:44,156 --> 00:14:47,263
>> JUST A SWEET WOMAN ENJOYING
THE RAIN.

209
00:14:47,263 --> 00:14:51,333
AND YOU COMMENTED, DIE.

210
00:14:54,569 --> 00:14:57,759
SO WHY'D YOU SAY IT?

211
00:14:57,759 --> 00:15:01,702
>> UM, I MEANT DIE, LIKE I'M
DYING.

212
00:15:01,702 --> 00:15:03,805
I LOVE THIS VID SO MUCH

213
00:15:03,805 --> 00:15:07,339
I MEANT SLAY, BUT I FORGOT THE
WORD

214
00:15:07,339 --> 00:15:11,897
I SAW SOMEONE BEING HAPPY AND
WANTED THEM TO FEEL THE EXACT
OPPOSITE.

215
00:15:11,897 --> 00:15:13,785
>> THAT'S CLOSE BUT IT'S NOT THE
FULL ANSWER.

216
00:15:13,785 --> 00:15:15,180
>> I'M ALONE A LOT.

217
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:18,267
SOME DAYS, I DON'T EVEN INTERACT
WITH ANOTHER HUMAN BEING

218
00:15:18,267 --> 00:15:21,703
AND I
START WONDERING AM I DEAD, IS
LIFE REAL,

219
00:15:21,703 --> 00:15:24,719
SO I POST COMMENTED
THAT I THINK WILL GET A RESPONSE FROM SOMEONE

220
00:15:24,719 --> 00:15:28,298
BECAUSE THAT'S THE
ONLY WAY TO BE CERTAIN I'M
ALIVE.

221
00:15:28,298 --> 00:15:30,446
>> THAT IS CORRECT.

222
00:15:30,446 --> 00:15:35,698
>> I REALLY DIDN'T UNDERSTAND
WHAT THIS SHOW WAS WHEN I SIGNED
UP FOR IT.

223
00:15:35,698 --> 00:15:37,922
>> THEN DON'T SIGN UP FOR STUFF.

224
00:15:37,922 --> 00:15:40,280
ALL RIGHT.
NEXT UP IS TYLER.

225
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:43,170
>> I WOULD LIKE TO GO HOME
PLEASE.

226
00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:44,459
>> YOU CAN'T.

227
00:15:44,459 --> 00:15:47,436
RECENTLY, AOC POSTED A PICTURE
WITH A CAPTION

228
00:15:47,436 --> 00:15:50,582
EVERY AMERICAN
SHOULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR HEALTH
CARE.

229
00:15:50,582 --> 00:15:55,823
YOU COMMENTED, HOT FOR CONGRESS,
BUT AT A PARTY.
MID.

230
00:15:57,264 --> 00:16:00,328
STILL SMASH THOUGH.

231
00:16:00,328 --> 00:16:04,733
SO THE QUESTION IS WHY'D YOU SAY
IT?

232
00:16:04,733 --> 00:16:07,017
>> I GOT HACKED.

233
00:16:07,017 --> 00:16:09,790
INSTAGRAM GOT HACKED

234
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:12,685
MY ASS TYPED IT ON A BUMPY BUS

235
00:16:12,685 --> 00:16:16,183
I GUESS I THOUGHT SHE WOULD SEE
MY COMMENT AND SHE WOULD COMMENT BACK,

236
00:16:16,287 --> 00:16:18,514
AND WE WOULD GET INTO A
FIGHT THAT GETS REALLY HEATED,

237
00:16:18,514 --> 00:16:21,055
FIRST SHE SLAPS ME AND THEN KISSES ME

238
00:16:21,055 --> 00:16:23,748
AND BEFORE YOU KNOW
IT, WE'RE HAVING SEX

239
00:16:23,748 --> 00:16:27,923
>> AND YOUR WIFE IS IN THE
AUDIENCE HERE TODAY.

240
00:16:27,923 --> 00:16:29,781
>> NO, SHE'S NOT.

241
00:16:29,781 --> 00:16:34,199
>> YOU CAN TRY TO MANIFEST ALL
YOU WANT, BUT IT DOESN'T CHANGE
THAT SHE'S HERE.

242
00:16:34,199 --> 00:16:37,794
>> YOU TOLD ME YOU DON'T HAVE AN
INSTAGRAM.

243
00:16:37,794 --> 00:16:40,498
>> YOUR NOT REAL, AND NONE OF
THIS IS HAPPENING TO ME.

244
00:16:40,498 --> 00:16:43,435
>> WOW.
SAD.
MOVING ON.

245
00:16:43,435 --> 00:16:48,298
JENNY, CNN POSTED A NEWS STORY
OF A NEW YORK FACTORY EXPLODING.

246
00:16:48,298 --> 00:16:52,943
YOU COMMENTED, SO AWFUL,
MOVE ME TO WRITE THIS SONG

247
00:16:52,943 --> 00:16:58,543
WITH A
NONWORKING LINK TO A SONG TITLED
THE JAGER MADE ME DO IT.

248
00:16:58,543 --> 00:17:01,603
SO THE QUESTION IS, WHY'D YOU
SAY IT?

249
00:17:01,603 --> 00:17:05,550
>> I THOUGHT IT WOULD HELP
PEOPLE COPE WITH THE TRAGEDY.

250
00:17:05,550 --> 00:17:07,930
I THOUGHT IT WOULD PROVIDE
CLOSURE

251
00:17:07,930 --> 00:17:11,020
MY SONG HAS AN IMPORTANT
MESSAGE.

252
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:12,527
>> LET ME PLAY A SNIPPET.

253
00:17:12,527 --> 00:17:16,760
♪ WASN'T GONNA DO IT, BUT THE
JAGER MADE ME DO IT ♪

254
00:17:24,306 --> 00:17:26,304
>> WHY'D YOU SAY IT?

255
00:17:26,304 --> 00:17:29,438
>> I'M THREE DAYS FROM HAVING TO
MOVE BACK TO OHIO

256
00:17:29,438 --> 00:17:32,899
BECAUSE I
SPENT ALL OF MY MONEY RECORDING
THE JAGER MADE ME DO IT,

257
00:17:32,899 --> 00:17:35,863
AND IT
HAS 279 VIEWS ON YOUTUBE,

258
00:17:35,863 --> 00:17:40,317
AND
THE ONLY COMMENT IS, WOULD
SMASH.

259
00:17:40,317 --> 00:17:43,192
>> YOU'RE WELCOME BY THE WAY.

260
00:17:43,192 --> 00:17:45,965
>> OKAY.
OKAY.
WE GET IT.

261
00:17:45,965 --> 00:17:50,308
IT'S WRONG TO LEAVE MEAN
COMMENTS OR POST COMMENTS JUST FOR CLOUT

262
00:17:50,308 --> 00:17:54,597
OR RUN YOUR MOUTH ON A
PODCAST AND YOU DON'T CONSIDER
THE IMPACT BECAUSE YOU'RE 24 AND STUPID,

263
00:17:54,597 --> 00:17:57,588
BUT I THINK I SPEAK FOR
EVERYONE WHEN I SAY

264
00:17:57,626 --> 00:18:03,133
FROM NOW ON,
WE'RE GOING TO BE A LOT MORE
THOUGHTFUL ABOUT WHAT WE POST
ONLINE.

265
00:18:08,295 --> 00:18:10,899
>> AW.
THAT'S SWEET.

266
00:18:10,983 --> 00:18:14,253
IS WHAT I WOULD HAVE SAID IF TWO
MINUTES AGO,

267
00:18:14,328 --> 00:18:18,541
YOU DIDN'T POST
THIS COMMENT ON MY PERSONAL
INSTAGRAM

268
00:18:18,541 --> 00:18:22,614
UNDER THIS PHOTO OF ME
AND MY 3-YEAR-OLD SON.

269
00:18:22,614 --> 00:18:26,862
YOU WROTE, WHAT DISEASE HE HAVE.

270
00:18:29,168 --> 00:18:31,831
>> I CANNOT CHANGE.

271
00:18:31,831 --> 00:18:33,440
>> THAT IS CORRECT.

272
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,761
ALL RIGHT.
AFTER THE BREAK, IT'S ROUND TWO.

273
00:18:35,761 --> 00:18:38,703
WHY DID YOU COMMENT COOL UNDER A
MOVIE TRAILER

274
00:18:38,703 --> 00:18:41,745
WHEN YOU COULD
HAVE JUST SMILED TO YOURSELF?

275
00:18:57,052 --> 00:19:01,522
>> ARE YOU GONNA BE AROUND AFTER

276
00:19:01,524 --> 00:19:01,856
SCHOOL?

277
00:19:01,858 --> 00:19:02,523

278
00:19:02,525 --> 00:19:02,857
>> COOL.

279
00:19:02,859 --> 00:19:07,161
ME TOO.

280
00:19:07,163 --> 00:19:08,996
>> GABBY IS SO CUTE.

281
00:19:08,998 --> 00:19:09,897
>> SERIOUSLY, BRO.

282
00:19:09,899 --> 00:19:10,765
>> I KNOW.

283
00:19:10,767 --> 00:19:13,267
LOOK, CAN I TELL YOU GUYS

284
00:19:13,269 --> 00:19:13,768
SOMETHING?

285
00:19:13,770 --> 00:19:14,602
>> YEAH, OF COURSE.

286
00:19:14,604 --> 00:19:16,103
>> SO MY PARENTS ARE GOING OUT

287

DOES THAT MEAN --

812
00:35:40,099 --> 00:35:43,940

I'M MICHAEL CHE.
>> I'M COLIN JOST.

813
00:35:45,095 --> 00:35:50,718
WELL, JUST HOURS AGO, PRESIDENT
BIDEN WON THE SOUTH CAROLINA
DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY

814
00:35:50,718 --> 00:35:55,142
BARELY EDGING
OUT HIS CLOSEST RIVAL, TIME.

815
00:35:57,518 --> 00:36:00,059
AS YOU MAY HAVE SEEN ON YOUR
AUNT'S FACEBOOK,

816
00:36:00,059 --> 00:36:05,494
MANY MAGA
PERSONALS ARE CLAIMING THE SUPER
BOWL IS BEING RIGGED
SO KANSAS CITY WINS

817
00:36:05,494 --> 00:36:10,403
AND TAYLOR SWIFT CAN
COME ON THE FIELD WITH TRAVIS
KELCE AND ENDORSE JOE BIDEN.

818
00:36:10,403 --> 00:36:14,796
MAGA PEOPLE HAVE SO MANY ENEMIES TO KEEP TRACK OF,

819
00:36:14,796 --> 00:36:19,916
YOU HAVE TO HATE THE
NFL, TAYLOR SWIFT, BUD LIGHT,
DISNEY,

820
00:36:19,916 --> 00:36:22,258
KRISTEN STEWART FOR SOME REASON,

821
00:36:22,258 --> 00:36:25,001
ELECTRIC STOVES, WIND MILLS,

822
00:36:25,001 --> 00:36:29,341
THE CONCEPT OF RAINBOWS,
AND THE GREEN M&M,

823
00:36:29,341 --> 00:36:33,823
AND YOU HAVE
TO THINK EVERYBODY IN THE
GOVERNMENT IS A SECRET PEDESTRIAN FILE

824
00:36:33,823 --> 00:36:38,793
EXCEPT FOR THIS
GUY DANCING WITH JEFFREY
EPSTEIN.

825
00:36:41,055 --> 00:36:45,040
I MEAN, ISN'T THAT THE HAPPIEST
YOU'VE EVER SEEN TRUMP?

826
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:49,647
HE'S DANCING LIKE NOBODY'S
CHECKING IDs.

827
00:36:51,317 --> 00:36:55,575
PRESIDENT BIDEN MADE A DRASTIC
CHANGE IN HIS IMMIGRATION POLICY

828
00:36:55,575 --> 00:36:59,877
SAYING HE WOULD BE WILLING TO
SHUT DOWN THE BORDER IF GIVEN
THE POWER BY CONGRESS.

829
00:36:59,877 --> 00:37:02,281
IT'S THE KIND OF UNEXPECTED
SHIFT IN DIRECTION

830
00:37:02,281 --> 00:37:06,093
BIDEN USUALLY
ONLY MAKES IN THE MIDDLE OF A
SENTENCE.

831
00:37:06,093 --> 00:37:09,402
THE BIDEN CAMPAIGN IS TRYING TO
APPEAL TO TO BLACK VOTERS.

832
00:37:09,402 --> 00:37:12,178
POLL SHOWS
DECLINE

833
00:37:12,178 --> 00:37:17,745
IT'S GETTING SO BAD, HE NOW ONLY
HAS SUPPORT FROM OBAMA'S WHITE
HALF.

834
00:37:20,931 --> 00:37:23,909
DID YOU GUYS ALL FORGET?

835
00:37:24,130 --> 00:37:27,511
>> IN SOME GREAT ECONOMIC NEWS
FOR PRESIDENT BIDEN,

836
00:37:27,511 --> 00:37:30,612
U.S. OIL
PRODUCTION HIT AN ALL-TIME HIGH
THIS WEEK,

837
00:37:30,711 --> 00:37:35,577
AND THE ECONOMY ADDED
A SURPRISINGLY ROBUST 350,000
JOBS.

838
00:37:35,577 --> 00:37:37,570
OR AS FOX NEWS REPORTED IT,

839
00:37:37,570 --> 00:37:41,051
ARE MIGRANTS TURNING YOUR KIDS
TRANS?

840
00:37:42,767 --> 00:37:45,946
CAMPAIGN FINANCE RECORDS SHOW IN
THE LAST SIX MONTHS,

841
00:37:45,946 --> 00:37:50,983
THE SUPER
PACK BEHIND DONALD TRUMP SPENT
$50 MILLION ON LEGAL FEES,

842
00:37:50,983 --> 00:37:54,539
AND
THAT'S WITH THE CHEAPEST WORST
LAWYERS OPT PLANET.

843
00:37:54,539 --> 00:37:57,218
CAN YOU IMAGINE SPENDING 50
MILLION

844
00:37:57,218 --> 00:38:00,180
ON THE PEOPLE WHO JUST
LOST YOU 83 MILLION?

845
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:02,947
THIS LAWYER DID SUCH A BAD JOB,

846
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:06,774
I THOUGHT HER ACTUAL NAME WAS
OVERRULED SIT DOWN.

847
00:38:07,561 --> 00:38:11,307
>> NIKKI HALEY HAS LAUNCHED A
SERIES OF CAMPAIGN ADS

848
00:38:11,307 --> 00:38:15,019
TARGETING
TRUMP AND BIDEN CALLED GRUMPY
OLD MEN.

849
00:38:15,019 --> 00:38:18,039
OKAY.
BUT AT LEAST THEY'RE MEN.

850
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:25,848
CHICAGO BECAME THE LARGEST U.S.
CITY

851
00:38:25,848 --> 00:38:28,322
TO CALL FOR A CEASE-FIRE IN GAZA,

852
00:38:28,322 --> 00:38:32,311
AND IN RETURN, GAZA CALLED
FOR A CEASE-FIRE IN CHICAGO.

853
00:38:36,513 --> 00:38:41,086
>> THE FCC IS PREPARING TO
CRIMINALIZE UNSOLICITED ROW BOW CALLED

854
00:38:41,086 --> 00:38:43,700
 THAT USE AI TO
IMPERSONATE POLITICIANS.

855
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:46,145
YOU CAN STILL IMPERSONATE TED CRUZ

856
00:38:46,145 --> 00:38:49,228
 BY SHAVING A SLOTH'S FACE.

857
00:38:51,967 --> 00:38:54,698
>> BLACK HISTORY MONTH STARTED
AN THURSDAY.

858
00:38:54,698 --> 00:38:56,639

859
00:38:56,639 --> 00:38:59,693
DURING A SENATE HEARING --

860
00:39:01,504 --> 00:39:04,273
DURING A SENATE HEARING ON CHILD SAFETY

00:39:04,273 --> 00:39:07,822
ONLINE META CEO MARK
ZUCKERBERG TURNED TO THE AUDIENCE 

862
00:39:07,822 --> 00:39:11,603
AND APOLOGIZED TO
FAMILIES OF CHILDREN HARMED BY
SOCIAL MEDIA.

863
00:39:11,603 --> 00:39:13,200
THE FAMILY SAID THEY WERE
SURPRISED 

864
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:16,240
AND, QUOTE, CHILLED TO
THE BONE.

865
00:39:16,903 --> 00:39:19,776
THAT'S A HORRIFYING MAN.

866
00:39:19,776 --> 00:39:25,411
>> NBC HAS ANNOUNCED PLANS FOR A
SPINOFF OF SUITS.
LA

867
00:39:25,411 --> 00:39:30,080
IT WILL FOCUS ON MEGHAN MARKLE'S
STRUGGLE TO BALANCE HER LEGAL CAREER

868
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:33,624
 WHILE ALSO CARING FOR AN
UNEMPLOYED IMMIGRANT.

869
00:39:35,608 --> 00:39:39,200
>> I LIKE THAT.
I LIKE THAT ONE.

870

A PIZZA HUT IN CANADA HAS GONE VIRAL 

871
00:39:42,513 --> 00:39:47,143
AFTER EMPLOYEES POSTED A
SIGN ON THE DOOR EXPLAINING THE
LOCATION WAS CLOSED

872
00:39:47,247 --> 00:39:50,438
 DUE TO
UNFORESEEN CIRCUMCISIONS.

873
00:39:50,541 --> 00:39:52,990
IT WAS OBVIOUSLY A MISPRINT

874
00:39:52,990 --> 00:39:56,560
BECAUSE PIZZA HUT LOVES EXTRA
TOPPINGS.

875
00:40:03,707 --> 00:40:07,438
>> A RACEHORSE IN OHIO WHICH HAD
WON A RACE EARLIER IN THE DAY

876
00:40:07,438 --> 00:40:09,818
LATER TESTED POSITIVE FOR METH.

877
00:40:09,818 --> 00:40:14,796
OHIO, WHERE YOU HAVE TO TEST
HORSES FOR METH.

STOLEN STATUE HONORING JACKIE ROBINSON

879
00:40:20,432 --> 00:40:23,274
 BUT SAY THAT IT WAS
DAMAGED BEYOND REPAIR.

880
00:40:23,274 --> 00:40:27,340
ALSO POLICE SHOT IT BECAUSE IT
REFUSED TO DROP THE BAT.

881
00:40:29,808 --> 00:40:33,433
I LIKE THIS CROWD A LOT, MAN.

882
00:40:34,162 --> 00:40:37,944
>> A FAMILY IN MICHIGAN WHOSE
DUCK LOST ITS MATE

 PLACED A
PERSONAL AD ONLINE TO FIND THE
BIRD A NEW PARTNER, 

884

 IS COMPETING IN
THE MRS. WORLD BEAUTY PAGEANT.

888
00:40:58,009 --> 00:41:01,439
I GUESS SHE JUST CAN'T GET
ENOUGH CROWNING.

889
00:41:08,692 --> 00:41:12,116
>> WELL, A LOT OF PEOPLE ASK ME
HOW TO GET TICKETS FOR SNL

890
00:41:12,116 --> 00:41:14,411
 AND
ONE OF THE WAYS IS THROUGH THE
TICKET LOTTERY.

891

IN FACT, YOU COULD SAY I'VE
ALWAYS FELT

895

 STRANGELY DRAWN TO
IT.

896
00:41:39,555 --> 00:41:41,716
>> THANKS SO MUCH FOR COMING.

897
00:41:41,716 --> 00:41:44,154
ARE YOU HERE WITH YOUR MOM AND
DAD?

898
00:41:44,250 --> 00:41:48,114
>> I WISH.
I NEVER MET MY DAD.

899
00:41:48,114 --> 00:41:52,852
OR AT LEAST I DON'T THINK I
HAVE.

900
00:41:55,980 --> 00:42:00,852
>> OH, WOW.
WOW.
YEAH.
I'M SO SORRY TO HEAR THAT.

901
00:42:00,852 --> 00:42:05,380
>> BUT IT'S SUCH AN HONOR TO BE

>> WHAT A COINCIDENCE, COLIN, 

905
00:42:19,367 --> 00:42:23,921
MY MOM'S A FORMER HOUSEKEEPER.

906
00:42:34,496 --> 00:42:37,269
>> SO YOUR DAD'S NOT IN THE
PICTURE?

907
00:42:37,269 --> 00:42:40,353
>> NOPE.
MY MAMA NEVER EVEN TOLD ME HIS
NAME.

908
00:42:40,353 --> 00:42:42,095
SHE JUST SAID HE WAS KNOWN AS

909
00:42:42,095 --> 00:42:46,390
 EL DIABLO DE LOS HAMPTONS.

910

UNUSUAL PENIS

913
00:43:02,552 --> 00:43:04,838
 JUST LIKE MINE.

914
00:43:04,838 --> 00:43:06,803
>> UNUSUAL HOW?

915
00:43:06,803 --> 00:43:10,835
>> SMALL AND CURLY, LIKE A PIG'S
TAIL.

916
00:43:12,511 --> 00:43:18,102
>> YEAH.
I'VE HEARD IT'S CALLED A PORCINE
PENILE ADAPTATION,

917
00:43:18,102 --> 00:43:20,337
 AND IT'S
ACTUALLY REALLY COMMON.

918
00:43:20,337 --> 00:43:23,676
ONE OUT OF EVERY 4 BILLION
PEOPLE HAVE IT.

919
00:43:23,676 --> 00:43:28,520
>> SO TWO PEOPLE IN THE WHOLE
WORLD?

920
00:43:37,719 --> 00:43:42,092
>> MY MOM SAYS I'M GETTING MORE
AND MORE LIKE MY DADDY EVERY
DAY.

921
00:43:42,092 --> 00:43:44,443
I'M NOT EVEN ALLOWED TO HAVE A
PHONE ANYMORE

922
00:43:44,443 --> 00:43:48,381
 BECAUSE I WAS
TAKING TOO MANY UPSKIRT PHOTOS.

923
00:43:48,449 --> 00:43:53,106
I'VE HAD SOME LUCK TOO, LIKE I'M
DATING THIS GORGEOUS GIRL 

924
00:43:53,106 --> 00:43:56,646
WHO'S
THE LEAD ACTRESS IN ALL THE
SCHOOL PLAYS,

925
00:43:56,646 --> 00:44:01,508
 AND NO ONE CAN
FIGURE OUT WHY SHE'S WITH ME.

926
00:44:01,962 --> 00:44:08,492
ANYTHING LIKE THAT EVER HAPPEN
TO YOU, COLIN?

927
00:44:12,891 --> 00:44:15,066
>> NOPE.

928
00:44:16,454 --> 00:44:21,561
>> GOSH, COLIN, DON'T YOU
SOMETIMES JUST FEEL LIKE --

929

>> YOU'RE BETTER THAN EVERYONE
ELSE?

930
00:44:24,045 --> 00:44:28,613
AND THERE'S NO REASON TO FEEL
THAT WAY?

931
00:44:36,475 --> 00:44:39,658
>> ANYWAY, THANKS FOR THE
TICKETS, COLIN.

932
00:44:39,658 --> 00:44:44,274
I LOVE THE SHOW, ESPECIALLY THAT
SARAH SHERMAN.

933
00:44:48,186 --> 00:44:52,284
HEY, LISTEN, SHE MAY BE WAY TOO LOUD,

934
00:44:52,284 --> 00:44:55,666
 BUT AFTER SHE BLOWS THAT
ONE LINE IN A SKETCH,

WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO
DO WITH THE PRIZE MONEY IF YOU
WIN?

952
00:46:14,692 --> 00:46:18,519
>> WELL, WE NEVER GOT THE
HONEYMOON WE DESERVE, 

953
00:46:18,519 --> 00:46:23,118
SO WHEN I

01:04:08,779 --> 01:04:10,211
YOU MAY BE SEATED.

1457
01:04:10,213 --> 01:04:12,113
ALL RIGHT, MS. DAVIS.

1458
01:04:12,115 --> 01:04:13,915
YOUR COMPLAINT IS THAT YOU

1459
01:04:13,917 --> 01:04:15,884
RECEIVED A BAD HAIR CUT FROM THE

1460
01:04:15,886 --> 01:04:16,251
DEFENDANT.

1461
01:04:16,253 --> 01:04:19,254
BUT FROM WHEN I CAN SEE, IT

1462
01:04:19,256 --> 01:04:19,688
LOOKS FINE.

1463
01:04:19,690 --> 01:04:21,690
>> YOUR HONOR, IT IS NOT FINE.

1464
01:04:21,692 --> 01:04:22,891
LOOK AT THIS.

1465
01:04:22,893 --> 01:04:24,292
THIS IS WHAT I'M LEFT WITH.

1466
01:04:24,294 --> 01:04:26,294
THIS IS ME RIGHT HERE ALL DAY

1467
01:04:26,296 --> 01:04:26,695
EVERY DAY.

1468
01:04:26,697 --> 01:04:29,664
>> GOD DAMN!

1469
01:04:29,666 --> 01:04:31,599
>> LET THE RECORD SHOW MS. DAVIS

1470
01:04:31,601 --> 01:04:34,469
IS REVEALING HER EXPOSED BRAIN.

1471
01:04:34,471 --> 01:04:36,404
>> YOUR HONOR, THAT IS NOT MY

1472
01:04:36,406 --> 01:04:36,771
FAULT.

1473
01:04:36,773 --> 01:04:39,941
SHE CAME UP IN MY SHOP LOOKING A

1474
01:04:39,943 --> 01:04:40,241
MESS.

1475
01:04:40,243 --> 01:04:41,977
I CLEANED HER ASS UP.

1476
01:04:41,979 --> 01:04:44,713
>> GIRL, MY BRAIN IS OUT OF MY

1477
01:04:44,715 --> 01:04:45,347
DAMN HEAD.

1478
01:04:45,349 --> 01:04:46,781
THIS INJURY HAS BEEN A

1479
01:04:46,783 --> 01:04:47,148
NIGHTMARE.

1480
01:04:47,150 --> 01:04:49,918
I LOST MY JOB AT THE ZOO BECAUSE

1481
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:51,586
THE QUOTES KEPT LICKING MY BRAIN

1482
01:04:51,588 --> 01:04:52,253
AND GETTING SICK.

1483
01:04:52,255 --> 01:04:54,255
>> YOUR HONOR, LET THE RECORD

1484
01:04:54,257 --> 01:04:55,457
SHOW SHE LYING.

1485
01:04:55,459 --> 01:04:56,424
SHE LOVES IT.

1486
01:04:56,426 --> 01:04:58,693
I SAW HER AT THE CLUB LAST NIGHT

1487
01:04:58,695 --> 01:04:59,527
BRAIN DOWN, ASS UP.

1488
01:04:59,529 --> 01:05:01,196
>> NO, I WASN'T.

1489
01:05:01,198 --> 01:05:03,164
>> YES, YOU WAS.

1490
01:05:03,166 --> 01:05:04,265
>> ALL RIGHT, GUYS.

1491
01:05:04,267 --> 01:05:06,368
>> THAT'S HOW IT WENT DOWN, YOUR

1492
01:05:06,370 --> 01:05:06,701
HONOR.

1493
01:05:06,703 --> 01:05:08,003
>> ALL RIGHT, MS. DAVIS, IT

1494
01:05:08,005 --> 01:05:09,237
APPEARS THAT NOW MORE THAN

1495
01:05:09,239 --> 01:05:10,905
ANYTHING, YOU NEED TO GO TO A

1496
01:05:10,907 --> 01:05:12,173
HOSPITAL.

1497
01:05:12,175 --> 01:05:13,408
>> OKAY.

1498
01:05:13,410 --> 01:05:14,175
FIRST OFF, NO.

1499
01:05:14,177 --> 01:05:16,611
I YA LET MY EX-BOYFRIEND SEE ME

1500
01:05:16,613 --> 01:05:19,948
LIKE THIS.

1501
01:05:19,950 --> 01:05:21,583
HE WORKS IN THE HOSPITAL.

1502
01:05:21,585 --> 01:05:22,617
>> HE PROBABLY JUST AN RN.

1503
01:05:22,619 --> 01:05:26,688
>> HE GETS PAID TO GIVE BLOOD.

1504
01:05:26,690 --> 01:05:29,090
IRREGARDLESS, I CAN'T LET HIM

1505
01:05:29,092 --> 01:05:29,591
SEE ME LIKE THIS.

1506
01:05:29,593 --> 01:05:30,191
>> LOOK LIKE IT HURT.

1507
01:05:30,193 --> 01:05:32,460
>> LOOK LIKE YOU NEED TO MIND

1508
01:05:32,462 --> 01:05:33,561
YOUR DAMN BUSINESS.

1509
01:05:33,563 --> 01:05:35,830
IT'S EMBARRASSING, AND WHEN IT'S

1510
01:05:35,832 --> 01:05:38,967
WINDY OUT, I CAN FEEL MY

1511
01:05:38,969 --> 01:05:40,402
MEMORIES GETTING BLOWN AWAY.

1512
01:05:40,404 --> 01:05:42,837
>> HOW ON EARTH DID IT GET THIS

1513
01:05:42,839 --> 01:05:43,104
BAD?

1514
01:05:43,106 --> 01:05:44,439
>> LET ME EXPLAIN.

1515
01:05:44,441 --> 01:05:49,577
SHE CAME UP TO ME IN MY SALON

1516
01:05:49,579 --> 01:05:51,613
AND SAID MAKE ME LOOK LIKE THIS.

1517
01:05:51,615 --> 01:05:54,883
>> LET THE RECORD SHOW THAT IS A

1518
01:05:54,885 --> 01:05:56,985
PHOTO OF MARGE SIMPSON FROM THE

1519
01:05:56,987 --> 01:05:58,086
SHOW THE SIMPSONS.

1520
01:05:58,088 --> 01:05:59,854
>> THIS IS NO FAULT OF MINE, I

1521
01:05:59,856 --> 01:06:04,225
HAVE A PLETHORA OF HAPPY

1522
01:06:04,227 --> 01:06:04,926
CLIENTS.

1523

MY MOST LOYAL CLIENT BEEN COMING

1524
01:06:06,930 --> 01:06:08,229

1525
01:06:08,231 --> 01:06:09,297
>> HELLO, YOUR HONOR.

1526
01:06:09,299 --> 01:06:13,334
I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT SHAUNA

1527
01:06:13,336 --> 01:06:15,336
HAS NEVER DONE ME WRONG.

1528
01:06:15,338 --> 01:06:16,971
I WOULD NEVER GO TO ANYONE ELSE.

1529
01:06:16,973 --> 01:06:17,939
I STOP TRAFFIC, OKAY?

1530
01:06:17,941 --> 01:06:18,606
>> NOT FOR THE REASONS YOU

1531
01:06:18,608 --> 01:06:23,011
THINK.

1532
01:06:23,013 --> 01:06:25,413
>> NOW, MRS. WHITE, TELL ME, HAS

1533
01:06:25,415 --> 01:06:26,881
YOUR HAIRLINE ALWAYS STARTED IN

1534
01:06:26,883 --> 01:06:27,749
THE PAST.

1535
01:06:27,751 --> 01:06:28,116
OH, SNAP.

1536
01:06:28,118 --> 01:06:29,317

OKAY.

1540
01:06:30,954 --> 01:06:32,921
IF YOU JUST GOING TO BE

1541
01:06:32,923 --> 01:06:34,189
DISRESPECTFUL, I'M JUST GOING TO

1542
01:06:34,191 --> 01:06:34,589

>> I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHY I CAME

1548
01:06:42,999 --> 01:06:43,298
HERE.

1549
01:06:43,300 --> 01:06:45,133
CAN SOMEONE BLOW ON THE BACK OF

1550
01:06:45,135 --> 01:06:47,068
MY BRAIN SO I CAN JUST FORGET

1551
01:06:47,070 --> 01:06:47,368
TODAY?

1552
01:06:47,370 --> 01:06:48,269
>> I GOT YOU, GIRL.

1553
01:06:48,271 --> 01:06:50,405

1554
01:06:50,407 --> 01:06:50,672
UP.

1555
01:06:50,674 --> 01:06:51,473
>> UM, NO.

1556
01:06:51,475 --> 01:06:54,409
YOU NOT GETTING ONE RED CENT,

1557
01:06:54,411 --> 01:06:56,678
THAT'S THE COLOR OF PENNIES.

1558
01:06:56,680 --> 01:06:57,479
>> I DON'T KNOW THAT BECAUSE

1559
01:06:57,481 --> 01:06:59,981
THAT PART OF MY BRAIN IS GONE.

1560
01:06:59,983 --> 01:07:02,217
>> WELL, YOU WASN'T USING IT

1561
01:07:02,219 --> 01:07:02,550
ANYWAY.

1562
01:07:02,552 --> 01:07:04,085
>> I'M ABOUT TO USE PART OF MY

1563
01:07:04,087 --> 01:07:06,254
FOOT TO PUT IT IN YOUR --

1564
01:07:06,256 --> 01:07:07,989
>> IN MY WHAT?

1565
01:07:07,991 --> 01:07:08,890
IN MY WHAT?

1566
01:07:08,892 --> 01:07:10,158
>> ORDER.

1567
01:07:10,160 --> 01:07:10,558
ORDER.

1568
01:07:10,560 --> 01:07:11,793
NOW, I'M NOT SURE WHO NEEDS TO

1569
01:07:11,795 --> 01:07:12,660
PAY WHO.

1570
01:07:12,662 --> 01:07:14,496
BUT I HOPE ALL INVOLVED GO TO

1571
01:07:14,498 --> 01:07:17,832
HELL WHEN THEY DIE.

1572
01:07:17,834 --> 01:07:19,467
I AIN'T SAYING DIE NOW, BUT

1573
01:07:19,469 --> 01:07:21,002
WHENEVER YOU DO, I HOPE HELL IS

1574
01:07:21,004 --> 01:07:22,303
WHERE YOU GO.

1575
01:07:22,305 --> 01:07:23,972
BUT I TELL YOU WHERE I'M ABOUT

1576
01:07:23,974 --> 01:07:26,241
TO GO, CHILI'S.

1577
01:07:26,243 --> 01:07:27,509
THAT'S RIGHT, I'M ABOUT TO CHECK

1578
01:07:27,511 --> 01:07:28,409
OUT THAT TWO FOR TWO.

1579
01:07:28,411 --> 01:07:30,011
PEACE!

THANK YOU SO MUCH.

1587
01:08:12,222 --> 01:08:13,721
IT'S BEEN A DREAM COME TRUE.

1588
01:08:13,723 --> 01:08:15,456
THE SHOW'S BEEN AMAZING.

1589
01:08:15,458 --> 01:08:15,890
