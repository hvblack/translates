1
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:05,532
>>> NO PERSON HAVING RECEIVED A
MAJORITY OF THE VOTES CAST,

2
00:00:05,532 --> 00:00:09,226
A SPEAKER HAS NOT BEEN ELECTED.

3
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:22,247
NO.
NO, I DIDN'T WIN, HONEY.

4
00:00:22,247 --> 00:00:24,412
NO.
NOT THIS TIME EITHER.

5
00:00:24,412 --> 00:00:27,024
NO, IT'S OKAY.
NO, I'M FEELING GOOD.

6
00:00:27,024 --> 00:00:30,655
OKAY.
I'LL SEE YOU AT HOME, SWEETIE.

7
00:00:30,655 --> 00:00:33,853
OKAY.
BYE BYE.
BYE BYE.

8
00:00:40,869 --> 00:00:43,626
>> MR. JORDAN, DO YOU NEED
ANOTHER PHONE?

9
00:00:43,626 --> 00:00:46,080
>> YES, KAYLA, PLEASE.

10
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:50,506
HOW DID I LOSE?
THIS IS CHAOS.

11
00:00:50,506 --> 00:00:54,705
SOME OF US ARE HERE TO ACTUALLY
SERVE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.

12
00:00:54,705 --> 00:00:58,890
ALL I WANT TO DO IS GET CONGRESS
BACK TO WORK

13
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:01,833
SO I CAN SHUT IT
DOWN AGAIN.

14
00:01:01,833 --> 00:01:03,480
>> YOU'LL GET THERE, SIR.

15
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:07,119
IN THE MEANTIME, THERE'S SOMEONE
HERE WHO WANTS TO CHEER YOU UP.

16
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:10,244
>> HI, JIM.

17
00:01:12,441 --> 00:01:14,861
WHAT THE HECK.

18
00:01:14,861 --> 00:01:18,044
>> GEORGE SANTOS?

19
00:01:18,044 --> 00:01:20,258
WHY DO YOU HAVE A BABY?

20
00:01:20,258 --> 00:01:22,476
>> NO ONE SEEMS TO KNOW.

21
00:01:22,476 --> 00:01:24,426
HEY, HON, CAN YOU TAKE THIS?

22
00:01:24,426 --> 00:01:26,552
>> WHERE?
>> JUST PUT HIM IN AN UBER.

23
00:01:26,552 --> 00:01:30,435
JIM, I JUST WANTED TO SAY HOW
SORRY I AM,

24
00:01:30,435 --> 00:01:33,124
BUT I WANT YOU TO KNOW I VOTED FOR YOU,

25
00:01:33,124 --> 00:01:37,749
AND GET
THIS, SO DID SHASHONNA LOGGINS.

26
00:01:37,749 --> 00:01:40,751
>> WHO'S THAT?
>> ALSO ME.

27
00:01:40,751 --> 00:01:45,747
>> I APPRECIATE THAT, GEORGE,
BUT I'M NOT READY TO GIVE UP.
OKAY?

28
00:01:45,747 --> 00:01:49,922
DO YOU THINK IF ONE MORE TIME I TRY,

29
00:01:49,922 --> 00:01:51,672
I COULD BE ELECTED SPEAKER?

30
00:01:51,672 --> 00:01:55,337
>> I WOULD BE LYING IF I SAID YES,

31
00:01:55,337 --> 00:01:57,861
SO, YES.

32
00:01:57,861 --> 00:02:00,393
>> OKAY, GEORGE.
THANK YOU FOR COMING.

33
00:02:00,393 --> 00:02:04,483
BUT I HAVE A LOT ON MY MIND
RIGHT NOW.
>> OF COURSE.

34
00:02:04,883 --> 00:02:08,477
I HAVE TO TAKE THIS.
IT'S TUPAC.

35
00:02:08,477 --> 00:02:13,029
GIRL, I KNOW.
JADA IS CRAZY.

36
00:02:15,067 --> 00:02:20,059
>> OH, MY GOD.
NONE OF THAT MADE ME FEEL
BETTER.

37
00:02:20,059 --> 00:02:23,633
>> MR. JORDAN, THERE'S ANOTHER
ONE OF YOUR SUPPORTERS ON LINE
TWO.

38
00:02:23,633 --> 00:02:26,669
>> GREAT.
I'LL TAKE WHOEVER I CAN GET.

39
00:02:26,669 --> 00:02:29,304
HELLO?
>> HI, JIM.

40
00:02:29,304 --> 00:02:33,042
IT'S YOUR FELLOW MEMBER OF THE
FREEDOM CAUCUS, LAUREN BOEBERT.

41
00:02:33,042 --> 00:02:37,430
>> OH, MY GOD.
LAUREN, HI.
IT'S BEEN A LONG DAY.

42
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:40,489
>> JIM, LOOK, THINGS ARE GOING
EXACTLY AS PLANNED.

43
00:02:40,489 --> 00:02:43,786
JUST KEEP RUNNING FOR SPEAKER,
AND EVEN IF YOU DON'T WIN, GREAT,

44
00:02:43,786 --> 00:02:47,505
THE GOVERNMENT SHUTS
DOWN, AND WE BLOW THIS WHOLE
THING UP.

45
00:02:47,505 --> 00:02:50,747
STOP, STOP.
OH, MY GOD.

46
00:02:50,747 --> 00:02:53,936
>> SORRY.
ARE YOU OUT SOMEWHERE?

47
00:02:53,936 --> 00:02:56,838
>> YEAH.
I GOT TO GO.
I'M AT THE THEATER SEEING
ALADDIN.

48
00:02:56,838 --> 00:02:58,732
GOOD LUCK, JIM.

49
00:02:58,732 --> 00:03:01,879
>> OH, GOD.
WHAT A NIGHT.

50
00:03:01,879 --> 00:03:04,185
I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO DO.

51
00:03:04,185 --> 00:03:09,378
I'M JUST SO CLOSE.
I ONLY NEED, WHAT, 100 VOTES?

52
00:03:09,378 --> 00:03:11,614
>> KNOCK, KNOCK, KNOCK.

53
00:03:11,614 --> 00:03:14,777
IS THIS THE LOSER'S OFFICE?

54
00:03:14,777 --> 00:03:19,162
>> MR. PRESIDENT, I'M SO GLAD
YOU'RE HERE.

55
00:03:19,162 --> 00:03:23,153
YOU ENDORSED ME, AND THEN YOU
JUST KIND OF DISAPPEARED.

56
00:03:23,153 --> 00:03:27,005
>> YEAH, WELL, THAT'S BECAUSE I
PREFER THE JORDANS WHO WIN,
OKAY?

57
00:03:27,005 --> 00:03:29,692
LIKE THE GREAT MICHAEL JORDAN

58
00:03:29,692 --> 00:03:34,523
OR THE EVEN GREATER JORDIN SPARKS.
NO AIR, REMEMBER THAT?

59
00:03:34,523 --> 00:03:38,226
NOW THAT WAS A SONG.
TELL ME HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO
BREATHE WITH NO AIR.

60
00:03:38,226 --> 00:03:39,970
YOU CAN'T.
YOU CAN'T DO IT.

61
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:43,445
BUT, JIM, I STILL LIKE YOU.
NOT LIKE-LIKE.

62
00:03:43,445 --> 00:03:45,783
IT'S MORE LIKE NOT-LIKE.

63
00:03:45,783 --> 00:03:48,285
LIKE, I DON'T LIKE YOU AT ALL.

64
00:03:48,285 --> 00:03:51,648
PART OF IT'S THE JACKET.
IT'S THE LACK OF THE JACKET.

65
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:53,100
YOU DON'T LOOK GOOD.

66
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:57,137
YOU LOOK LIKE THE NIGHT MANAGER
AT A TWO STAR STEAK HOUSE.

67
00:03:57,137 --> 00:04:00,163
>> I UNDERSTAND, SIR.
I'VE BEEN TOLD THAT BEFORE.

68
00:04:00,163 --> 00:04:03,824
>> BUT PEOPLE ARE SAYING THAT I
WOULD MAKE A GREAT SPEAKER.

69
00:04:03,824 --> 00:04:05,516
>> I MEAN, YOU WOULD, SIR.

70
00:04:05,516 --> 00:04:08,812
>> IT'S TRUE.
BUT SADLY I'LL BE TOO BUSY
CAMPAIGNING,

71
00:04:08,812 --> 00:04:14,296
TRAVELING FROM CITY
TO CITY VISITING THEIR BEAUTIFUL
COURTROOMS, YOU KNOW.

72
00:04:14,704 --> 00:04:18,422
BUT I'M DOING GREAT THINGS FOR
THE COURTS.
DOING GREAT THINGS FOR THE
COURTS.

73
00:04:18,422 --> 00:04:21,023
>> THIS IS ALL JUST SO
FRUSTRATING, SIR.

74
00:04:21,023 --> 00:04:24,921
I DID EXACTLY WHAT YOU WOULD DO,
INTIMIDATION, THREATS.

75
00:04:24,921 --> 00:04:26,397
WHY DIDN'T IT WORK?

76
00:04:26,397 --> 00:04:29,234
>> BECAUSE FRANKLY, YOU'RE NOT
ME, OKAY?

77
00:04:29,234 --> 00:04:32,086
YOU'RE NO FUN.
I'M HILARIOUS, OKAY?

78
00:04:32,086 --> 00:04:36,480
I'M A CREEP, I'M A WEIRDO.
WHAT THE HELL IS HE DOING HERE?

79
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:39,623
THEY DON'T PLAY CREEP ANYMORE.
YOU NOTICE THAT?

80
00:04:39,623 --> 00:04:43,222
EVERYBODY ELSE DOES IT, BUT
RADIO DOESN'T DO IT.

81
00:04:43,222 --> 00:04:47,758
YOU'RE LITTLE JIM JORDAN.
I'M DONALD TRUMP, OKAY?

82
00:04:47,758 --> 00:04:50,255
I'M COKE.
YOU'RE SHASTA.

83
00:04:50,255 --> 00:04:54,056
>> BUT YOU ENDORSED ME, AND I
STILL LOST.

84
00:04:54,056 --> 00:04:58,000
>> SEEMS TO HAPPEN A LOT.
IT'S HAPPENING A LOT, BUT THAT'S
OKAY.

85
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,048
YOU CAN'T GIVE UP, ALL RIGHT?
YOU CAN'T GIVE UP BECAUSE THIS
IS AMERICA.

86
00:05:02,048 --> 00:05:05,343
IT'S THE MOST BEAUTIFUL COUNTRY
IN THE WORLD FILLED WITH SOME
TERRIBLE PEOPLE,

87
00:05:05,343 --> 00:05:09,210
SOME AWFUL PEOPLE,
SOME OF THE WORST PEOPLE
YOU'VE EVER SEEN, BUT WE LOVE
IT.

88
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:12,220
WHAT A BEAUTIFUL NATION IT IS.
WHAT A WONDERFUL NATION.

89
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:15,717
NOT SO MUCH IN TERMS OF THE
PEOPLE.
PEOPLE ARE VERY BAD AND WEIRD.

90
00:05:15,717 --> 00:05:19,145
DON'T WE LOVE OUR COUNTRY?
WHAT AN AWFUL PLACE IT IS.

91
00:05:19,145 --> 00:05:21,874
>> GOT IT.
SO DO YOU THINK I CAN WIN?

92
00:05:21,874 --> 00:05:24,032
>> HONESTLY, I COULDN'T CARE
LESS.

93
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:26,869
BUT SOON, I'LL BE BACK IN
PRESIDENT,

94
00:05:26,869 --> 00:05:29,887
AND DON'T YOU WORRY,
JIM, I'LL TAKE CARE OF YOU.

95
00:05:29,887 --> 00:05:32,951
OH, YES, YOU WILL BE TAKEN CARE
OF.

96
00:05:32,951 --> 00:05:36,453
>> ALL RIGHT.
I DON'T LOVE THE WAY YOU'RE
SAYING THAT,

97
00:05:36,453 --> 00:05:37,846
BUT LIVE --

98
00:05:37,846 --> 00:05:40,322
>> HOLD IT.
THAT'S NOT FOR LOSERS.

99
00:05:40,322 --> 00:05:44,431
LIVE FROM NEW YORK, IT'S
SATURDAY NIGHT!

100
00:07:47,057 --> 00:07:51,499
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, BAD BUNNY!

101
00:08:13,725 --> 00:08:18,422
>>> THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK
YOU VERY MUCH.

102
00:08:18,422 --> 00:08:21,520
MY NAME IS BONITO, AND

103
00:08:23,387 --> 00:08:27,148
AND I'M VERY EXCITED TO BE HERE ON --

104
00:08:27,292 --> 00:08:28,770
OH, SORRY.

105
00:08:30,257 --> 00:08:34,012
SNL, SNL.

106
00:08:36,463 --> 00:08:39,823
PEOPLE ARE WONDERING IF I CAN
HOST THIS SHOW

107
00:08:39,823 --> 00:08:43,060
BECAUSE ENGLISH
IS NOT MY FIRST LANGUAGE.

108
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:45,227
I DON'T KNOW IF THEY KNOW,

109
00:08:45,227 --> 00:08:49,110
BUT I DO WHATEVER I WANT.

110
00:08:52,106 --> 00:08:56,542
SO I CAN HOST THIS SHOW IN
ENGLISH.

111
00:08:56,542 --> 00:09:00,943
I CAN ORDER McDONALD'S IN
ENGLISH.

112
00:09:01,573 --> 00:09:06,180
I CAN HAVE SEX IN ENGLISH.

113
00:09:08,387 --> 00:09:11,821
BUT I PREFER SEX IN SPANISH
BECAUSE IT'S JUST BETTER.

114
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:17,002
I JUST PREFER SPANISH, YOU KNOW.

115
00:09:36,485 --> 00:09:37,978
NON

116
00:09:37,978 --> 00:09:41,015
NOT AGAIN, PLEASE.
NOT AGAIN.

117
00:09:41,878 --> 00:09:44,392
EXCUSE ME.
CAN WE CHANGE THAT?

118
00:09:44,392 --> 00:09:46,280
CAN WE DO IT RIGHT?

119
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:50,010
SEXIER

120
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:53,133
THANK YOU.
NOW, MUCH BETTER.
THANK YOU.

121
00:09:53,133 --> 00:09:56,518
YOU KNOW WHAT, I DON'T TRUST ON
THIS THING.

122
00:09:56,518 --> 00:09:59,941
SO I WANT TO BRING UP MY FRIEND
TO HELP.

123
00:09:59,941 --> 00:10:01,610
PEDRO.

124
00:10:12,151 --> 00:10:16,212
>> SO YOU -- YOU WANT ME TO --

125
00:10:16,212 --> 00:10:20,294
DO YOU WANT ME TO TRANSLATE?

126
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:23,998
>> WHAT?
>> YOU WANT ME TO TRANSLATE?

127
00:10:23,998 --> 00:10:25,847
SI

128
00:10:26,359 --> 00:10:28,393
>> YES.

129
00:10:51,883 --> 00:10:55,127
>> OKAY.
HE SAYS I'M BLESSED TO BE HERE

130
00:10:55,127 --> 00:10:57,776
WITH MY FAVORITE ACTOR, PEDRO
PASCAL.

131
00:11:03,672 --> 00:11:07,130
>> I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING,
PEDRO.
I KNOW.

132
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:11,162
BUT CAN YOU AT LEAST GIVE ME
ADVICE ON MY MONOLOGUE?

133
00:11:11,162 --> 00:11:14,582
>> WELL, I DID HOST LAST SEASON.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

134
00:11:14,582 --> 00:11:18,357
AND WHEN YOU'RE DOING A
MONOLOGUE, I FIND IT'S ALWAYS
CHARMING

135
00:11:18,357 --> 00:11:20,776
WHEN YOU MAKE A
SELF-DEPRECATING JOKE.

136
00:11:21,714 --> 00:11:22,731
>> WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

137
00:11:22,731 --> 00:11:25,044
>> OKAY.
IT'S LIKE YOU MAKE A JOKE

138
00:11:25,044 --> 00:11:29,184
ABOUT
A PART OF YOUR BODY OR YOUR FACE
THAT'S UNFLATTERING.

139
00:11:29,184 --> 00:11:31,574
>> I DON'T HAVE ANY.

140
00:11:33,731 --> 00:11:36,320
>> TOTALLY.
ME EITHER.

141
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,635
YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE WORKS?
- WHAT?

142
00:11:38,635 --> 00:11:43,069
AUDIENCES LOVE IT WHEN YOU SHOW
AN EMBARRASSING PHOTO OF
YOURSELF.

143
00:11:43,883 --> 00:11:46,248
>> OKAY.
I CAN DO THAT.

144
00:11:49,444 --> 00:11:51,978
>> I'M SORRY.
HOW IS THAT EMBARRASSING?

145
00:11:51,978 --> 00:11:55,010
>> BECAUSE I FORGOT TO PUT ON
CLOTHES.

146
00:11:55,010 --> 00:11:58,723
>> OKAY.
THERE'S CLEARLY NOTHING ABOUT
YOU TO MAKE FUN OF.

147
00:11:58,723 --> 00:12:02,299
WHY DON'T YOU JUST TELL EVERYONE
WHAT YOU WANTED TO SAY?

148
00:12:02,299 --> 00:12:06,340
>> WELL, I WANT TO SAY I'M VERY
GRATEFUL TO BE HERE.

149
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:08,530
THANK YOU TO EVERYONE WHO
SUPPORTS ME,

150
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:11,823
AND EVERYONE WHO

UPDATE" WITH COLIN JOST AND
MICHAEL CHE.

519
00:33:33,487 --> 00:33:36,871
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
THANK YOU.
GOOD EVENING, EVERYONE.

520
00:33:36,871 --> 00:33:40,621
>> WELCOME TO "WEEKEND UPDATE."
I'M MICHAEL CHE.
>> I'M COLIN JOST.

521
00:33:41,815 --> 00:33:44,832
IN WHAT MANY PEOPLE ARE CALLING
A HIGH POINT OF HIS TERM,

522
00:33:44,832 --> 00:33:47,191
PRESIDENT BIDEN GAVE MULTIPLE
SPEECHES THIS WEEK

523
00:33:47,191 --> 00:33:52,001
IN WHICH HE
ISSUED THE SAME STRONG WARNING
TO ANYONE THINKING ABOUT
ATTACKING ISRAEL.

524
00:33:52,001 --> 00:33:53,752
AND HERE WAS HIS MESSAGE.

525
00:33:53,752 --> 00:34:04,523
DON'T.
DON'T, DON'T, DON'T.

526
00:34:05,342 --> 00:34:07,595
>> I WON'T.

527
00:34:07,595 --> 00:34:11,450
I REALLY LIKE THAT BIDEN ONLY
NEEDS ONE WORD TO GET HIS POINT
ACROSS.

528
00:34:11,450 --> 00:34:14,933
HE'S BASICALLY THE GRUT OF
PRESIDENTS.

529
00:34:14,933 --> 00:34:18,312
BUT TO GIVE YOU AN IDEA OF HOW
EFFECTIVE DON'T IS,

530
00:34:18,312 --> 00:34:20,731
IT'S THE
SAME THING BIDEN SAYS TO HIS DOG

531
00:34:20,731 --> 00:34:23,959
RIGHT BEFORE IT BITES ANOTHER
SECRET SERVICE AGENT.

532
00:34:25,733 --> 00:34:29,869
ALSO, WHILE HE WAS IN ISRAEL,
BIDEN SAID THE HAMAS ATTACK

533
00:34:29,869 --> 00:34:32,662
WAS
LIKE, QUOTE, 159/11s.

534
00:34:32,662 --> 00:34:35,507
OKAY, YOU CAN'T GO SOMEWHERE TO
CALM PEOPLE DOWN

535
00:34:35,507 --> 00:34:39,127
AND THEN START
RATING THINGS IN NUMBERS OF
9/11s.

536
00:34:39,128 --> 00:34:41,472
NOT CALM SCALE

537
00:34:41,472 --> 00:34:43,881
IT WOULD BE LIKE IF YOUR DOCTOR
GAVE YOU AMBIEN AND SAID,

538
00:34:43,881 --> 00:34:48,111
THIS WILL MAKE YOU SLEEPIER THAN 20
COSBYS.

539
00:34:51,790 --> 00:34:56,920
>> JIM JORDAN SEEN HERE
DESCRIBING HOW HE ATTACKS THE NIPPLE

540
00:34:56,920 --> 00:35:00,632
IS NO LONGER THE NOMINEE
FOR HOUSE SPEAKER

541
00:35:00,632 --> 00:35:02,592
AFTER
REPUBLICANS DROPPED HIM FRIDAY,

542
00:35:02,592 --> 00:35:07,226
WHICH, BY THE WAY, HE'S USED TO,
BECAUSE HE WAS DROPPED A LOT AS
A CHILD.

543
00:35:07,226 --> 00:35:12,724
POTENTIAL NEW CANDIDATES FOR
SPEAKER INCLUDE TOM EMMER, KEVIN
HERN, JACK BURMAN,

544
00:35:12,724 --> 00:35:16,912
AND SIX
OTHERS WHO ARE CLEARLY GEORGE
SANTOS.

545
00:35:21,463 --> 00:35:25,021
>> AFTER A JUDGE ISSUED A GAG
ORDER AGAINST PRESIDENT TRUMP,

546
00:35:25,021 --> 00:35:29,829
TRUMP TOLD REPORTERS THAT THE
JUDGE SAID BASICALLY I DON'T
HAVE THE RIGHT TO SPEAK.

547
00:35:29,829 --> 00:35:33,329
THEN HE ADDED, SHE'S LIKE
LITERALLY KILLING ME.

548
00:35:33,329 --> 00:35:36,966
THEN HE YELLED, YOU'RE NOT EVEN
MY REAL MOM

549
00:35:36,966 --> 00:35:39,949
AND SLAMMED HIS
BEDROOM DOOR.

550
00:35:42,944 --> 00:35:44,399
IT HAPPENED.

551
00:35:44,399 --> 00:35:47,614
AND YESTERDAY ON TRUTH SOCIAL,

552
00:35:47,614 --> 00:35:52,583
TRUMP POSTED A COURTROOM SKETCH
OF HIM SITTING NEXT TO JESUS.

553
00:35:52,583 --> 00:35:57,359
BECAUSE IF THERE'S ONE GUY WHOSE
TRIAL FAMOUSLY ENDED WELL,

554
00:35:57,359 --> 00:35:59,377
IT'S
JESUS.

555
00:36:01,059 --> 00:36:05,372
>> RON DeSANTIS REPORTEDLY SPENT
$1.5 MILLION

556
00:36:05,372 --> 00:36:08,099
ON PRIVATE JETS IN
JUST OVER THREE MONTHS

557
00:36:08,099 --> 00:36:12,691
BECAUSE
WHEN HE FLIES COMMERCIAL, THEY
MAKE HIM TAKE OFF HIS HEELS IN
FRONT OF EVERYBODY.

558
00:36:13,338 --> 00:36:17,332
JUSTICE AMY CONEY BARRETT SAID
SHE WOULDN'T MIND

559
00:36:17,332 --> 00:36:20,493
SEEING A CODE
OF CONDUCT INSTITUTED FOR THE SUPREME COURT,

560
00:36:20,493 --> 00:36:25,349
WHILE CLARENCE
THOMAS SAID HE WOULDN'T MIND
SEEING WHAT SHE'S WORKING WITH
UNDER THAT ROBE.

561
00:36:31,257 --> 00:36:36,007
>> NETFLIX IS PLANNING TO OPEN
ITS OWN NETWORK OF BRICK AND
MORTAR STORES,

562
00:36:36,007 --> 00:36:41,128
WHICH IS LIKE A
SERIAL KILLER WALKING AROUND IN
THE SKIN OF HIS VICTIM.

563
00:36:44,977 --> 00:36:48,431
ACCORDING TO A LEAKED EXCERPT
FROM HER UPCOMING MEMOIR,

564
00:36:48,431 --> 00:36:52,287
BRITNEY SPEARS SAID SHE GOT
PREGNANT WHILE DATING JUSTIN TIMBERLAKE

565
00:36:52,287 --> 00:36:56,483
BECAUSE BACK THEN,
EVEN THEIR CONDOMS WERE DENIM.

566
00:36:58,987 --> 00:37:02,431
>> JADA PINKETT SMITH HAS BEEN
WAKE MAIKING SOME WAVES 

567
00:37:02,431 --> 00:37:05,532
WITH
SOME OF THE REVELATIONS
 IN HER NEW MEMOIR, "WORTHY" 

568
00:37:05,532 --> 00:37:08,309
HERE TO
COMMENT IS JADA PINKETT SMITH.

569
00:37:12,690 --> 00:37:15,383
IT'S SO GOOD TO SEE YOU,
MICHAEL.

570
00:37:15,383 --> 00:37:18,237
THANK YOU FOR COMING TO THE RED
TABLE.

571
00:37:18,237 --> 00:37:20,555
SORRY IF I SEEM A LITTLE TIRED.

572
00:37:20,555 --> 00:37:23,490
I'VE BEEN ON THE TODAY SHOW 14
TIMES IN THREE DAYS.

573
00:37:23,490 --> 00:37:25,716
>> YOU GETTING A LOT OF BUZZ
FROM YOUR NEW BOOK.

574
00:37:25,716 --> 00:37:30,999
YOU REVEALED THAT YOU AND WILL
SMITH HAVE BEEN SEPARATED SINCE
2016.

575
00:37:30,999 --> 00:37:33,172
>> UH-HUH.
THAT'S THE TRUTH.
THAT IS THE TRUTH.

576
00:37:33,172 --> 00:37:36,529
BUT THE DAY WE GOT MARRIED, I
KNEW THERE WAS GOING TO BE
TROUBLE.

577
00:37:36,529 --> 00:37:39,370
AT OUR WEDDING, SOMEONE STOOD UP
AND OBJECTED.

578
00:37:39,370 --> 00:37:43,143
>> WHO WAS IT?
>> IT WAS ME.
YEAH, IT WAS ME.

579
00:37:43,143 --> 00:37:47,945
BUT IT'S OKAY.
23 YEARS LATER, WILL AND I ARE
STILL A UNIT.

580
00:37:47,945 --> 00:37:52,199
AND IT'S BECAUSE WE HAVE LEARNED
THAT THE SECRET TO A SUCCESSFUL MARRIAGE

581
00:37:52,199 --> 00:37:55,170
 IS NEVER GO TO BED
HAPPY.

582
00:37:55,170 --> 00:37:58,226
>> AND YOU GUYS DESCRIBED YOUR
MARRIAGE AS BRUTIFUL,

583
00:37:58,226 --> 00:38:00,237
 AS IN
BRUTAL AND BEAUTIFUL.

584
00:38:00,237 --> 00:38:05,349
>> YEAH.
AND OTHER PEOPLE DESCRIBE IT AS
BRUM-HEALTHY.

585
00:38:05,349 --> 00:38:08,365
BUT WE'RE DOING GREAT, MICHAEL.
WE REALLY ARE.

586
00:38:08,365 --> 00:38:12,031
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN A VERY,
VERY LONG TIME,

587
00:38:12,031 --> 00:38:15,053
 I AM IN SUCH A
SOLID AND FORTIFIED PLACE.

588
00:38:15,053 --> 00:38:17,590
NOTHING MAKES ME FEEL STRONGER

589
00:38:17,590 --> 00:38:20,890
THAN PUBLICLY CUCKING MY
MILLIONAIRE HUSBAND.

590
00:38:20,890 --> 00:38:24,264
>> I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
WHY NOT JUST GET A DIVORCE?

591
00:38:24,264 --> 00:38:27,866
>> OH, NO, DIVORCE IS NOT AN
OPTION.

592
00:38:27,866 --> 00:38:29,471
I HAVE PRINCIPALS, MICHAEL.

593
00:38:29,471 --> 00:38:33,083
IF WE GOT DIVORCED, HE COULD
MESS AROUND AND END UP HAPPY.

594
00:38:33,608 --> 00:38:36,283
AND I CAN'T HAVE THAT.

595
00:38:36,284 --> 00:38:37,867
HAPPY

596
00:38:37,867 --> 00:38:41,191
>> HE CALLED YOUR MARRIAGE A
SLOPPY PUBLIC EXPERIMENT

597
00:38:41,191 --> 00:38:42,900
 IN
UNCONDITIONAL LOVE.

598
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:46,219
>> YEAH, UH-HUH.
THAT WAS ACTUALLY IN OUR VOWS.

599
00:38:46,219 --> 00:38:49,850
YEAH.
SO ANYWAY, BACK TO TUPAC.

600
00:38:49,850 --> 00:38:51,914
>> I NEVER SAID TUPAC.

601
00:38:51,914 --> 00:38:54,660
>> WELL, I CAN'T STOP SAYING
TUPAC, ALL RIGHT?

602
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:56,356
WE WERE SO CLOSE.

603
00:38:56,356 --> 00:38:59,269
AND A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T KNOW
THIS, BUT BEFORE HE DIED,

604
00:38:59,269 --> 00:39:03,771
 HE WAS
IN THE PROCESS OF LEGALLY
CHANGING HIS NAME TO TUPINKETT.

605
00:39:04,612 --> 00:39:06,607
HE WAS MY SOUL MATE.

606
00:39:06,607 --> 00:39:09,870
>> WHAT ABOUT WILL?
YOU SAID IN YOUR BOOK THAT HIM
SLAPPING CHRIS ROCK 

607
00:39:09,870 --> 00:39:12,146
ACTUALLY
BROUGHT YOU CLOSER TOGETHER AS A
COUPLE.

608
00:39:12,146 --> 00:39:13,833
>> THAT'S RIGHT, THAT'S RIGHT.

609
00:39:13,833 --> 00:39:18,019
IT WAS THE FIRST TIME IN YEARS
THAT I FELT LIKE HIS WIFE.

610
00:39:18,019 --> 00:39:22,524
AND NOW I AM SO CLEAR ON WHAT TO
DO IF WE EVER START DRIFTING
APART AGAIN.

611
00:39:22,524 --> 00:39:24,981
>> AND WHAT'S THAT?
>> THE NEXT TIME WE HIT A ROUGH PATCH, 

612
00:39:24,981 --> 00:39:27,641
I'M GOING TO ASK WILL TO
SHOOT KEVIN HART.

613
00:39:27,641 --> 00:39:29,783
>> JADA PINKETT SMITH,

WOULD VIOLATE OUR TRUST AND OUR

1038
00:58:06,066 --> 00:58:07,466

>> SISTERS, NO GAMBLING.

1053
00:58:32,426 --> 00:58:35,727
WE NEED TO FOCUS ON FINDING THE

1054
00:58:35,729 --> 00:58:40,599
MAN HIDDEN AMONGST US AND FORCE

00:58:50,277 --> 00:58:50,642
GENEVIEVE?

1061

1066
00:58:59,787 --> 00:59:02,254
>> SISTERS, CAN WE PLEASE FOCUS

1067
00:59:02,256 --> 00:59:04,623
ON THE EVIL MAN TRYING TO

1068
00:59:04,625 --> 00:59:06,191
CORRUPT OUR PRECIOUS VIRGIN

1069
00:59:06,193 --> 00:59:08,060
SOULS?

1070
00:59:08,062 --> 00:59:10,028
>> CERTAINLY, THIS MAN OR WOMAN

1071
00:59:10,030 --> 00:59:12,698
IS CLEARLY SO SEXY THAT EVEN GOD

1072
00:59:12,700 --> 00:59:13,732
CANNOT STOP HIM.

1073
00:59:13,734 --> 00:59:16,401
WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT THE

1074
00:59:16,403 --> 00:59:16,735
VIRGINS.

1075
00:59:16,737 --> 00:59:19,338
SPEND TIME WITH THE VIRGINS,

1076
00:59:19,340 --> 00:59:21,707
GIVE THE VIRGINS EVERYTHING WE

1077
00:59:21,709 --> 00:59:22,007
GOT.

1078
00:59:22,009 --> 00:59:24,376
>> BESIDES, I HEARD GOD CAN'T

1079

SEE IT AS LONG AS YOU DO IT IN

1080
00:59:26,246 --> 00:59:28,880
THE BELL TOWER AND THE MAN USES

1081
00:59:28,882 --> 00:59:33,118
HIS PENIS TO RING THE BELL AND

1082
00:59:33,120 --> 00:59:34,853
YELL DING DONG.

1083
00:59:34,855 --> 00:59:37,456
>> SADLY, DING DONG IS WHAT I

1084
00:59:37,458 --> 00:59:39,491
HEAR ALSO ABOUT THAT MAN.

1085
00:59:39,493 --> 00:59:40,826
>> I DON'T KNOW WHY EVERYONE IS

1086
00:59:40,828 --> 00:59:42,027
NOT MORE OUTRAGED.

1087
00:59:42,029 --> 00:59:46,431
WHOEVER IS AGREEING TO HAVE

1088
00:59:46,433 --> 00:59:50,068
S-E-X WITH THIS MAN IS JUST AS

1089
00:59:50,070 --> 00:59:51,837
GUILTY AS HE IS.

1090
00:59:51,839 --> 00:59:52,704
>> YEAH.

1091
00:59:52,706 --> 00:59:54,773
OR MAYBE THERE'S ONE NUN WHO'S

1092
00:59:54,775 --> 00:59:55,240
GETTING NONE.

1093
00:59:55,242 --> 00:59:56,408
>> EXCUSE ME?

1094
00:59:56,410 --> 00:59:57,376
>> YEAH.

1095
00:59:57,378 --> 01:00:01,713
MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE SHE'S A

1096
01:00:01,715 --> 01:00:03,415
LITTLE STRING BEAN AND WHEN HE

1097
01:00:03,417 --> 01:00:06,585
TRIED TO HIT THE BELL WITH HIS

1098
01:00:06,587 --> 01:00:10,389
PENIS, IT DOESN'T GO DING DONG,

1099
01:00:10,391 --> 01:00:13,358
IT GOES WHOMP WHOMP.

1100
01:00:13,360 --> 01:00:14,192
>> THAT IS ENOUGH!

1101
01:00:14,194 --> 01:00:15,660
I'LL GIVE HIM ONE FINAL CHANCE

1102
01:00:15,662 --> 01:00:16,395
TO CONFESS.

1103
01:00:16,397 --> 01:00:21,233
>> YEAH, CONFESS!

1104
01:00:21,235 --> 01:00:23,402
WHOEVER YOU ARE, YOU BEAUTIFUL

1105
01:00:23,404 --> 01:00:26,972
MONSTER, YOU SEXUAL KING, JUST

1106
01:00:26,974 --> 01:00:30,709
ADMIT WHAT YOU DID.

1107
01:00:36,917 --> 01:00:37,482
>> FINE.

1108
01:00:37,484 --> 01:00:40,919
I CONFESS.

1109
01:00:40,921 --> 01:00:42,187
IT WAS ME.

1110
01:00:42,189 --> 01:00:44,756
I WITH US THE ONE WHO CORRUPTED

1111
01:00:44,758 --> 01:00:46,892
THESE POOR WOMEN WITH MY LIPS

1112
01:00:46,894 --> 01:00:51,396
AND MY HIPS, AND I WAS THE ONE

1113
01:00:51,398 --> 01:00:55,200
WHO RANG THE BELL WITH MY PENIS

1114
01:00:55,202 --> 01:00:57,669
AND YELLED DING DONG.

1115
01:00:57,671 --> 01:00:59,938

1116
01:00:59,940 --> 01:01:00,972
BETRAY US LIKE THIS?

1117
01:01:00,974 --> 01:01:02,507
>> I KNOW.

1118
01:01:02,509 --> 01:01:04,543
THIS IS PROBABLY THE WORST SEX

1119
01:01:04,545 --> 01:01:07,946
SCANDAL IN THE HISTORY OF THE

1120
01:01:07,948 --> 01:01:08,280
CHURCH.

1121
01:01:08,282 --> 01:01:10,816
BUT LOOK ON THE BRIGHT SIDE,

1122
01:01:10,818 --> 01:01:13,652
BEFORE I GOT HERE, ALL THESE

1123
01:01:13,654 --> 01:01:18,156
SISTERS JUST FUMBLED, "OUR

1124

1125
01:01:20,861 --> 01:01:22,160
SCREAMING, "OH, GOD".

1126
01:01:22,162 --> 01:01:23,962
>> SISTER KEVIN, I'M AFRAID YOU

1127
01:01:23,964 --> 01:01:25,597
MUST LEAVE THIS CONVENT AT ONCE.

1128
01:01:25,599 --> 01:01:28,500

SISTER KEVIN CAN STAY.

1139
01:01:52,059 --> 01:01:54,126

WE'RE ALL HERE.

OUR COMPANY BURT'S BEES IS BEING

1149

01:02:30,797 --> 01:02:34,232
OWNED BY AVEENO, WHICH IS OWNED

1151
01:02:34,234 --> 01:02:38,436
BY YOPLAIT, SO IT'S GOING TO BE

1152
01:02:38,438 --> 01:02:39,538
A NEW CHAPTER.

1153
01:02:39,540 --> 01:02:42,574
>> I THINK IT'S EXCITING.

1154
01:02:42,576 --> 01:02:43,041
>> YOU WOULD.

1155
01:02:43,043 --> 01:02:45,477

1156
01:02:45,479 --> 01:02:47,312

>> WE NEED TO MAKE SURE WE'RE

1159
01:02:50,717 --> 01:02:52,918
ALL ON THE SAME PAGE ABOUT OUR

1160
01:02:52,920 --> 01:02:53,919
STRATEGY BEFORE WE MEET WITH

1161
01:02:53,921 --> 01:02:55,086
THEIR PEOPLE.

1162
01:02:55,088 --> 01:02:56,621
WE HAVE A LOT TO TALK ABOUT

TODAY, SO BUCKLE UP.

1164
01:02:57,558 --> 01:02:59,291
>> BEFORE WE START, CAN I SAY

1165
01:02:59,293 --> 01:03:00,258
ONE THING?

1166
01:03:00,260 --> 01:03:02,561
>> SURE, ENRIQUE, OF COURSE.

1167
01:03:02,563 --> 01:03:04,296

>> THANK YOU.

1175
01:03:15,842 --> 01:03:16,675
>> ALL RIGHT.

1176
01:03:16,677 --> 01:03:18,610
SO WHEN COMPANIES GET BOUGHT

1177
01:03:18,612 --> 01:03:20,812
OUT, ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS

1178
01:03:20,814 --> 01:03:22,180
THEY LOOK AT IS STAFF SIZE.

1179
01:03:22,182 --> 01:03:24,583
>> ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT

1180
01:03:24,585 --> 01:03:24,983
LAYOFFS?

1181
01:03:24,985 --> 01:03:25,984
>> I HOPE NOT.

1182
01:03:25,986 --> 01:03:27,719
>> THEY USUALLY GET RID OF THE

1183
01:03:27,721 --> 01:03:30,455
OLD CEO.

1184
01:03:30,457 --> 01:03:32,757
>> OKAY.

01:03:34,127 --> 01:03:35,060
I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

1187
01:03:35,062 --> 01:03:36,461
>> CAN I SAY ONE MORE THING

1188
01:03:36,463 --> 01:03:37,162
ABOUT IT?

1189
01:03:37,164 --> 01:03:39,598

THAT'S AWESOME, MAN.

01:03:46,106 --> 01:03:47,272
I LOVE THAT.

1197

GLAD YOU LIKE YOUR DAUGHTER'S

1198
01:03:54,581 --> 01:03:54,913
FIONCE.

1199
01:03:54,915 --> 01:03:57,549
YOU'RE ALL MAKING ME NERVOUS

1200
01:03:57,551 --> 01:03:58,950
LIKE THEY'RE GOING TO GET RID OF

1201
01:03:58,952 --> 01:03:59,217
ME.

1202
01:03:59,219 --> 01:04:00,986
>> MAYBE THEY'RE LOOKING TO

1203
01:04:00,988 --> 01:04:02,654
DIVERSIFY THE LEADERSHIP ROLES.

1204
01:04:02,656 --> 01:04:04,489
>> UH-OH, DON'T LIKE THE SOUND

1205
01:04:04,491 --> 01:04:06,358
OF THAT.

1206
01:04:06,360 --> 01:04:08,126
>> EXCUSE ME?

1207
01:04:08,128 --> 01:04:08,593
>> I'M JOKING.

1208
01:04:08,595 --> 01:04:09,661
I'M TOTALLY JOKING.

1209
01:04:09,663 --> 01:04:11,663
>> CAN I SAY ONE MORE LITTLE

1210
01:04:11,665 --> 01:04:11,963
THING?

1211
01:04:11,965 --> 01:04:12,297
>> YEAH.

1212
01:04:12,299 --> 01:04:13,598
GO AHEAD, ENRIQUE.

1213
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:16,501
>> HIS NAME IS JEFF.

1214
01:04:16,503 --> 01:04:18,803
>> THAT'S AWESOME, MAN.

1215
01:04:18,805 --> 01:04:20,405
HIS NAME IS JEFF, YEAH.

1216
01:04:20,407 --> 01:04:23,108
I'M GLAD YOU'RE IN A GOOD MOOD,

1217
01:04:23,110 --> 01:04:25,010
ENRIQUE, BUT YOU KNOW PEOPLE'S

01:04:25,012 --> 01:04:27,779
JOBS ARE ON THE LINE HERE.

1219
01:04:27,781 --> 01:04:28,179
>> NOT JEFF.

1220
01:04:28,181 --> 01:04:29,047
HE WORKS AT GOOGLE.

1221
01:04:29,049 --> 01:04:30,649
>> OKAY.

1222
01:04:30,651 --> 01:04:32,050
WELL, LUCKY HIM.

1223
01:04:32,052 --> 01:04:35,720
>> NO, LUCKY ME.

1224
01:04:35,722 --> 01:04:37,155

01:04:37,157 --> 01:04:37,455
OKAY.

LET'S TALK IN PAIRS, COME UP

1227
01:04:40,694 --> 01:04:41,226
WITH IDEAS.

1228
01:04:41,228 --> 01:04:43,094
WE WANT TO RETAIN AS MANY PEOPLE

1229
01:04:43,096 --> 01:04:45,530

01:04:45,532 --> 01:04:45,930
PITCH HERE.

>> SHE JUST DON'T HAVE THE BEE

1232
01:04:48,669 --> 01:04:49,034
EXPERTISE.

1233
01:04:49,036 --> 01:04:51,469
THE MORE WE HANDLE OURSELVES,

1234
01:04:51,471 --> 01:04:52,904
THE BETTER THEY'LL DO.

1235
01:04:52,906 --> 01:04:54,105
>> WRITE THAT DOWN.

1236
01:04:54,107 --> 01:04:56,341
>> OUR SALES ARE GREAT.

1237
01:04:56,343 --> 01:04:57,842
WE'RE IN EVERY DRUGSTORE YOU CAN

1238
01:04:57,844 --> 01:04:59,711
THINK OF.

1239
01:04:59,713 --> 01:05:00,912
>> THEY WERE FRIENDS WHEN THEY

1240
01:05:00,914 --> 01:05:01,746
WERE KIDS.

1241
01:05:01,748 --> 01:05:03,682
THEY DRIFTED APART, AND THEN

1242
01:05:03,684 --> 01:05:04,582
THEY CAME BACK TOGETHER.

1243
01:05:04,584 --> 01:05:05,617
>> WELL, THAT'S ADORABLE.

1244
01:05:05,619 --> 01:05:08,186
>> I MEAN, YOU CAME UP WITH THE

1245
01:05:08,188 --> 01:05:08,586
FOOT SCRUB.

1246
01:05:08,588 --> 01:05:09,621
YOU HAVE TO STAY.

1247
01:05:09,623 --> 01:05:13,458
>> AND YOU BROUGHT IN

1248
01:05:13,460 --> 01:05:15,060
EXFOLIATING.

1249
01:05:15,062 --> 01:05:15,493
THAT'S HUGE.

1250
01:05:15,495 --> 01:05:18,496
>> MY SPEECH IS FUNNY, BUT NICE

1251
01:05:18,498 --> 01:05:18,830
FUNNY.

1252
01:05:18,832 --> 01:05:20,231
>> THAT'S HOW YOU GOT TO DO IT.

1253
01:05:20,233 --> 01:05:21,800
>> ALL RIGHT, GUYS.

1254
01:05:21,802 --> 01:05:24,135
LET'S COME BACK.

1255
01:05:24,137 --> 01:05:26,004
WHAT DID WE ALL COME UP WITH?

1256
01:05:26,006 --> 01:05:30,809
WHAT QUESTIONS DO WE NEED TO

1257
01:05:30,811 --> 01:05:32,143
ANSWER TODAY?

1258
01:05:32,145 --> 01:05:32,844
>> WELL, OUR BIGGEST QUESTION

1259
01:05:32,846 --> 01:05:33,611
RIGHT NOW IS BAND OR DJ BECAUSE

1260
01:05:33,613 --> 01:05:35,447
THE DJ IS CHEAPER, BUT THE

1261
01:05:35,449 --> 01:05:35,814
BAND --

1262
01:05:35,816 --> 01:05:37,482
>> THE BAND IS LIKE WHOA.

1263
01:05:37,484 --> 01:05:41,920
>> OKAY, GUYS, LET'S FOCUS HERE.

1264
01:05:41,922 --> 01:05:43,254
ENRIQUE, WHAT WAS OUR OVERHEAD

1265
01:05:43,256 --> 01:05:44,856
FOR THE PAST FOUR QUARTERS?

1266
01:05:44,858 --> 01:05:45,490
>> I DON'T KNOW.

1267
01:05:45,492 --> 01:05:46,191
DON'T ASK ME.

1268
01:05:46,193 --> 01:05:49,260
>> WELL, YOU'RE OUR ACCOUNTANT,

1269
01:05:49,262 --> 01:05:49,527
BUD.

1270
01:05:49,529 --> 01:05:51,429
I DON'T KNOW WHO ELSE TO ASK.

1271
01:05:51,431 --> 01:05:53,498
LOOK, I'M VERY HAPPY FOR YOU,

1272
01:05:53,500 --> 01:05:56,568
BUT I FEEL LIKE YOU'RE A LITTLE

1273
01:05:56,570 --> 01:05:57,602
DISTRACTED, ENRIQUE.

1274
01:05:57,604 --> 01:05:59,371
>> AND WHY SHOULDN'T HE BE?

1275
01:05:59,373 --> 01:06:00,405
HE'S HAPPY.

1276
01:06:00,407 --> 01:06:02,140
>> BECAUSE OUR COMPANY IS ON THE

1277
01:06:02,142 --> 01:06:02,440
LINE.

1278
01:06:02,442 --> 01:06:03,608
>> JUST BECAUSE YOUR DAUGHTER

1279
01:06:03,610 --> 01:06:06,644
CAN'T KEEP A MAN.

1280
01:06:06,646 --> 01:06:07,645
>> SHE'S 6.

1281
01:06:07,647 --> 01:06:08,179
>> WELL, SHE'S TALL.

1282
01:06:08,181 --> 01:06:10,482
I DIDN'T KNOW.

1283
01:06:10,484 --> 01:06:13,852
>> GUYS, GUYS.

1284
01:06:13,854 --> 01:06:15,553
THIS IS IMPORTANT.

1285
01:06:15,555 --> 01:06:17,856
OUR COMPANY IS BELOVED, OKAY?

1286
01:06:17,858 --> 01:06:20,625
WE GRIND UP BEES AND TURN IT

1287
01:06:20,627 --> 01:06:22,060
INTO CHAPSTICK.

1288
01:06:22,062 --> 01:06:24,162
PEOPLE LOVE THAT.

1289
01:06:24,164 --> 01:06:26,898
SO WHEN THOSE SUITS FROM JERGENS

1290
01:06:26,900 --> 01:06:29,701
COME IN HERE AND THEY SAY, SORRY

1291
01:06:29,703 --> 01:06:31,569
TO BREAK IT TO YOU, BUT YOU HAVE

1292
01:06:31,571 --> 01:06:34,606
TO LAY OFF 30% OF YOUR STAFF,

1293
01:06:34,608 --> 01:06:35,874
WHAT ARE WE GOING TO SAY?

1294
01:06:35,876 --> 01:06:37,409
>> WE'RE GOING TO SAY NO.

1295
01:06:37,411 --> 01:06:38,276
>> NOT TODAY.

1296
01:06:38,278 --> 01:06:39,377
>> BECAUSE HIS DAUGHTER'S

1297
01:06:39,379 --> 01:06:40,078
GETTING MARRIED.

1298
01:06:40,080 --> 01:06:41,012
>> YEAH.

1299
01:06:41,014 --> 01:06:42,447
SO WE'RE NOT DOING ALL OF THAT.

1300
01:06:42,449 --> 01:06:44,215
>> BECAUSE WE HAVE A WEDDING TO

1301
01:06:44,217 --> 01:06:44,849
PAY FOR.

1302
01:06:44,851 --> 01:06:47,252
>> BECAUSE WE ARE A FAMILY.

1303
