1
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:05,532
>>> NO PERSON HAVING RECEIVED A
MAJORITY OF THE VOTES CAST,

2
00:00:05,532 --> 00:00:09,226
A SPEAKER HAS NOT BEEN ELECTED.

3
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:22,247
NO.
NO, I DIDN'T WIN, HONEY.

4
00:00:22,247 --> 00:00:24,412
NO.
NOT THIS TIME EITHER.

5
00:00:24,412 --> 00:00:27,024
NO, IT'S OKAY.
NO, I'M FEELING GOOD.

6
00:00:27,024 --> 00:00:30,655
OKAY.
I'LL SEE YOU AT HOME, SWEETIE.

7
00:00:30,655 --> 00:00:33,853
OKAY.
BYE BYE.
BYE BYE.

8
00:00:40,869 --> 00:00:43,626
>> MR. JORDAN, DO YOU NEED
ANOTHER PHONE?

9
00:00:43,626 --> 00:00:46,080
>> YES, KAYLA, PLEASE.

10
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:50,506
HOW DID I LOSE?
THIS IS CHAOS.

11
00:00:50,506 --> 00:00:54,705
SOME OF US ARE HERE TO ACTUALLY
SERVE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.

12
00:00:54,705 --> 00:00:58,890
ALL I WANT TO DO IS GET CONGRESS
BACK TO WORK

13
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:01,833
SO I CAN SHUT IT
DOWN AGAIN.

14
00:01:01,833 --> 00:01:03,480
>> YOU'LL GET THERE, SIR.

15
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:07,119
IN THE MEANTIME, THERE'S SOMEONE
HERE WHO WANTS TO CHEER YOU UP.

16
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:10,244
>> HI, JIM.

17
00:01:12,441 --> 00:01:14,861
WHAT THE HECK.

18
00:01:14,861 --> 00:01:18,044
>> GEORGE SANTOS?

19
00:01:18,044 --> 00:01:20,258
WHY DO YOU HAVE A BABY?

20
00:01:20,258 --> 00:01:22,476
>> NO ONE SEEMS TO KNOW.

21
00:01:22,476 --> 00:01:24,426
HEY, HON, CAN YOU TAKE THIS?

22
00:01:24,426 --> 00:01:26,552
>> WHERE?
>> JUST PUT HIM IN AN UBER.

23
00:01:26,552 --> 00:01:30,435
JIM, I JUST WANTED TO SAY HOW
SORRY I AM,

24
00:01:30,435 --> 00:01:33,124
BUT I WANT YOU TO KNOW I VOTED FOR YOU,

25
00:01:33,124 --> 00:01:37,749
AND GET
THIS, SO DID SHASHONNA LOGGINS.

26
00:01:37,749 --> 00:01:40,751
>> WHO'S THAT?
>> ALSO ME.

27
00:01:40,751 --> 00:01:45,747
>> I APPRECIATE THAT, GEORGE,
BUT I'M NOT READY TO GIVE UP.
OKAY?

28
00:01:45,747 --> 00:01:49,922
DO YOU THINK IF ONE MORE TIME I TRY,

29
00:01:49,922 --> 00:01:51,672
 I COULD BE ELECTED SPEAKER?

30
00:01:51,672 --> 00:01:55,337
>> I WOULD BE LYING IF I SAID YES,

31
00:01:55,337 --> 00:01:57,861
 SO, YES.

32
00:01:57,861 --> 00:02:00,393
>> OKAY, GEORGE.
THANK YOU FOR COMING.

33
00:02:00,393 --> 00:02:04,483
BUT I HAVE A LOT ON MY MIND
RIGHT NOW.
>> OF COURSE.

34
00:02:04,883 --> 00:02:08,477
I HAVE TO TAKE THIS.
IT'S TUPAC.

35
00:02:08,477 --> 00:02:13,029
GIRL, I KNOW.
JADA IS CRAZY.

36
00:02:15,067 --> 00:02:20,059
>> OH, MY GOD.
NONE OF THAT MADE ME FEEL
BETTER.

37
00:02:20,059 --> 00:02:23,633
>> MR. JORDAN, THERE'S ANOTHER
ONE OF YOUR SUPPORTERS ON LINE
TWO.

38
00:02:23,633 --> 00:02:26,669
>> GREAT.
I'LL TAKE WHOEVER I CAN GET.

39
00:02:26,669 --> 00:02:29,304
HELLO?
>> HI, JIM.

40
00:02:29,304 --> 00:02:33,042
IT'S YOUR FELLOW MEMBER OF THE
FREEDOM CAUCUS, LAUREN BOEBERT.

41
00:02:33,042 --> 00:02:37,430
>> OH, MY GOD.
LAUREN, HI.
IT'S BEEN A LONG DAY.

42
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:40,489
>> JIM, LOOK, THINGS ARE GOING
EXACTLY AS PLANNED.

43
00:02:40,489 --> 00:02:43,786
JUST KEEP RUNNING FOR SPEAKER,
AND EVEN IF YOU DON'T WIN, GREAT,

44
00:02:43,786 --> 00:02:47,505
 THE GOVERNMENT SHUTS
DOWN, AND WE BLOW THIS WHOLE
THING UP.

45
00:02:47,505 --> 00:02:50,747
STOP, STOP.
OH, MY GOD.

46
00:02:50,747 --> 00:02:53,936
>> SORRY.
ARE YOU OUT SOMEWHERE?

47
00:02:53,936 --> 00:02:56,838
>> YEAH.
I GOT TO GO.
I'M AT THE THEATER SEEING
ALADDIN.

48
00:02:56,838 --> 00:02:58,732
GOOD LUCK, JIM.

49
00:02:58,732 --> 00:03:01,879
>> OH, GOD.
WHAT A NIGHT.

50
00:03:01,879 --> 00:03:04,185
I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO DO.

51
00:03:04,185 --> 00:03:09,378
I'M JUST SO CLOSE.
I ONLY NEED, WHAT, 100 VOTES?

52
00:03:09,378 --> 00:03:11,614
>> KNOCK, KNOCK, KNOCK.

53
00:03:11,614 --> 00:03:14,777
IS THIS THE LOSER'S OFFICE?

54
00:03:14,777 --> 00:03:19,162
>> MR. PRESIDENT, I'M SO GLAD
YOU'RE HERE.

55
00:03:19,162 --> 00:03:23,153
YOU ENDORSED ME, AND THEN YOU
JUST KIND OF DISAPPEARED.

56
00:03:23,153 --> 00:03:27,005
>> YEAH, WELL, THAT'S BECAUSE I
PREFER THE JORDANS WHO WIN,
OKAY?

57
00:03:27,005 --> 00:03:29,692
LIKE THE GREAT MICHAEL JORDAN 

58
00:03:29,692 --> 00:03:34,523
OR THE EVEN GREATER JORDIN SPARKS.
NO AIR, REMEMBER THAT?

59
00:03:34,523 --> 00:03:38,226
NOW THAT WAS A SONG.
TELL ME HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO
BREATHE WITH NO AIR.

60
00:03:38,226 --> 00:03:39,970
YOU CAN'T.
YOU CAN'T DO IT.

61
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:43,445
BUT, JIM, I STILL LIKE YOU.
NOT LIKE-LIKE.

62
00:03:43,445 --> 00:03:45,783
IT'S MORE LIKE NOT-LIKE.

63
00:03:45,783 --> 00:03:48,285
LIKE, I DON'T LIKE YOU AT ALL.

64
00:03:48,285 --> 00:03:51,648
PART OF IT'S THE JACKET.
IT'S THE LACK OF THE JACKET.

65
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:53,100
YOU DON'T LOOK GOOD.

66
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:57,137
YOU LOOK LIKE THE NIGHT MANAGER
AT A TWO STAR STEAK HOUSE.

67
00:03:57,137 --> 00:04:00,195
>> I UNDERSTAND, SIR.
I'VE BEEN TOLD THAT BEFORE.

68
00:04:00,236 --> 00:04:03,824
>> BUT PEOPLE ARE SAYING THAT I
WOULD MAKE A GREAT SPEAKER.

69
00:04:03,824 --> 00:04:05,516
>> I MEAN, YOU WOULD, SIR.

70
00:04:05,516 --> 00:04:08,812
>> IT'S TRUE.
BUT SADLY I'LL BE TOO BUSY
CAMPAIGNING, 

71
00:04:08,812 --> 00:04:14,296
TRAVELING FROM CITY
TO CITY VISITING THEIR BEAUTIFUL
COURTROOMS, YOU KNOW.

72
00:04:14,704 --> 00:04:18,422
BUT I'M DOING GREAT THINGS FOR
THE COURTS.
DOING GREAT THINGS FOR THE
COURTS.

73
00:04:18,422 --> 00:04:21,023
>> THIS IS ALL JUST SO
FRUSTRATING, SIR.

74
00:04:21,023 --> 00:04:24,921
I DID EXACTLY WHAT YOU WOULD DO,
INTIMIDATION, THREATS.

75
00:04:24,921 --> 00:04:26,397
WHY DIDN'T IT WORK?

76
00:04:26,397 --> 00:04:29,234
>> BECAUSE FRANKLY, YOU'RE NOT
ME, OKAY?

77
00:04:29,234 --> 00:04:32,086
YOU'RE NO FUN.
I'M HILARIOUS, OKAY?

78
00:04:32,086 --> 00:04:36,480
I'M A CREEP, I'M A WEIRDO.
WHAT THE HELL IS HE DOING HERE?

79
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:39,594
THEY DON'T PLAY CREEP ANYMORE.
YOU NOTICE THAT?

80
00:04:39,693 --> 00:04:43,222
EVERYBODY ELSE DOES IT, BUT
RADIO DOESN'T DO IT.

81
00:04:43,222 --> 00:04:47,758
YOU'RE LITTLE JIM JORDAN.
I'M DONALD TRUMP, OKAY?

82
00:04:47,758 --> 00:04:50,255
I'M COKE.
YOU'RE SHASTA.

83
00:04:50,255 --> 00:04:54,056
>> BUT YOU ENDORSED ME, AND I
STILL LOST.

84
00:04:54,056 --> 00:04:58,000
>> SEEMS TO HAPPEN A LOT.
IT'S HAPPENING A LOT, BUT THAT'S
OKAY.

85
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,048
YOU CAN'T GIVE UP, ALL RIGHT?
YOU CAN'T GIVE UP BECAUSE THIS
IS AMERICA.

86
00:05:02,048 --> 00:05:05,343
IT'S THE MOST BEAUTIFUL COUNTRY
IN THE WORLD FILLED WITH SOME
TERRIBLE PEOPLE, 

87
00:05:05,343 --> 00:05:09,210
SOME AWFUL PEOPLE,
 SOME OF THE WORST PEOPLE
YOU'VE EVER SEEN, BUT WE LOVE
IT.

88
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:12,220
WHAT A BEAUTIFUL NATION IT IS.
WHAT A WONDERFUL NATION.

89
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:15,717
NOT SO MUCH IN TERMS OF THE
PEOPLE.
PEOPLE ARE VERY BAD AND WEIRD.

90
00:05:15,717 --> 00:05:19,145
DON'T WE LOVE OUR COUNTRY?
WHAT AN AWFUL PLACE IT IS.

91
00:05:19,145 --> 00:05:21,874
>> GOT IT.
SO DO YOU THINK I CAN WIN?

92
00:05:21,874 --> 00:05:24,003
>> HONESTLY, I COULDN'T CARE
LESS.

93
00:05:24,072 --> 00:05:26,869
BUT SOON, I'LL BE BACK IN
PRESIDENT, 

94
00:05:26,869 --> 00:05:29,887
AND DON'T YOU WORRY,
JIM, I'LL TAKE CARE OF YOU.

95
00:05:29,887 --> 00:05:32,951
OH, YES, YOU WILL BE TAKEN CARE
OF.

96
00:05:32,951 --> 00:05:36,453
>> ALL RIGHT.
I DON'T LOVE THE WAY YOU'RE
SAYING THAT, 

97
00:05:36,453 --> 00:05:37,846
BUT LIVE --

98
00:05:37,846 --> 00:05:40,322

106
00:08:43,724 --> 00:08:45,524
PEOPLE ARE WONDERING IF I CAN

107
00:08:45,526 --> 00:08:47,325
HOST THIS SHOW BECAUSE ENGLISH

108
00:08:47,327 --> 00:08:50,095
IS NOT MY FIRST LANGUAGE.

109
00:08:50,097 --> 00:08:52,030
I DON'T KNOW IF THEY KNOW, BUT I

110
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:54,799

00:11:27,554 --> 00:11:28,286
SELF-DEPRECATING JOKE.

158
00:11:28,288 --> 00:11:29,421
>> WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

159
00:11:29,423 --> 00:11:30,155
>> OKAY.

160
00:11:30,157 --> 00:11:33,258
IT'S LIKE YOU MAKE A JOKE ABOUT

161
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:34,726
A PART OF YOUR BODY OR YOUR FACE

162
00:11:34,728 --> 00:11:35,393
THAT'S UNFLATTERING.

163
00:11:35,395 --> 00:11:40,298
>> I DON'T HAVE ANY.

164
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:43,668
>> TOTALLY.

165
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:44,502
ME EITHER.

166
00:11:44,504 --> 00:11:47,172
YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE WORKS?

167
00:11:47,174 --> 00:11:48,506
AUDIENCES LOVE IT WHEN YOU SHOW

168
00:11:48,508 --> 00:11:50,208
AN EMBARRASSING PHOTO OF

169
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:50,575
YOURSELF.

170
00:11:50,577 --> 00:11:50,909
>> OKAY.

171
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:56,614
I CAN DO THAT.

172
00:11:56,616 --> 00:11:57,449
>> I'M SORRY.

173
00:11:57,451 --> 00:11:58,850
HOW IS THAT EMBARRASSING?

174
00:11:58,852 --> 00:11:59,551
>> BECAUSE I FORGOT TO PUT ON

175
00:11:59,553 --> 00:12:01,653
CLOTHES.

176
00:12:01,655 --> 00:12:02,821
>> OKAY.

177
00:12:02,823 --> 00:12:04,622
THERE'S CLEARLY NOTHING ABOUT

178
00:12:04,624 --> 00:12:07,125
YOU TO MAKE FUN OF.

179
00:12:07,127 --> 00:12:09,027
WHY DON'T YOU JUST TELL EVERYONE

180
00:12:09,029 --> 00:12:12,430
WHAT YOU WANTED TO SAY?

181
00:12:12,432 --> 00:12:16,534
>> WELL, I WANT TO SAY I'M VERY

182
00:12:16,536 --> 00:12:17,068
GRATEFUL TO BE HERE.

00:14:46,136 --> 00:14:48,202
LIKE HOW MY FIRST KISS WAS WITH

205
00:14:48,204 --> 00:14:49,103
MY FIRST COUSIN.

206
00:14:49,105 --> 00:14:49,737
THAT'S RIGHT.

207
00:14:49,739 --> 00:14:51,372
AND MY SECOND KISS TOO.

00:14:51,374 --> 00:14:53,274

YOU HAVE BARS ABOUT MY COUSIN?

216
00:15:11,394 --> 00:15:13,528

217
00:15:13,530 --> 00:15:13,828
THAT.

218
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:15,763
>> BUT THAT STUFF NOT EVEN HALF

235

A HIGH POINT OF HIS TERM,

PRESIDENT BIDEN GAVE MULTIPLE

528
00:33:53,415 --> 00:33:55,649
SPEECHES THIS WEEK IN WHICH HE

529
00:33:55,651 --> 00:33:57,451
ISSUED THE SAME STRONG WARNING

530
00:33:57,453 --> 00:33:58,919
TO ANYONE THINKING ABOUT

531
00:33:58,921 --> 00:33:59,853
ATTACKING ISRAEL.

532
00:33:59,855 --> 00:34:01,321

>> I WON'T.

541
00:34:14,336 --> 00:34:16,169
I REALLY LIKE THAT BIDEN ONLY

542
00:34:16,171 --> 00:34:18,338
NEEDS ONE WORD TO GET HIS POINT

543
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:18,672
ACROSS.

544
00:34:18,674 --> 00:34:22,342

PRESIDENTS.

546
00:34:22,744 --> 00:34:24,845
BUT TO GIVE YOU AN IDEA OF HOW

547
00:34:24,847 --> 00:34:26,279
EFFECTIVE DON'T IS, IT'S THE

548
00:34:26,281 --> 00:34:28,748
SAME THING BIDEN SAYS TO HIS DOG

549
00:34:28,750 --> 00:34:29,649
RIGHT BEFORE IT BITES ANOTHER

550
00:34:29,651 --> 00:34:32,853
SECRET SERVICE AGENT.

551
00:34:32,855 --> 00:34:34,721
ALSO, WHILE HE WAS IN ISRAEL,

552
00:34:34,723 --> 00:34:36,857
BIDEN SAID THE HAMAS ATTACK WAS

553

LIKE, QUOTE, 159/11s.

GAVE YOU AMBIEN AND SAID, THIS

560

WHICH, BY THE WAY, HE'S USED TO,

568
00:35:12,227 --> 00:35:13,894

A CHILD.

00:58:13,407 --> 00:58:15,807
STOP IT.

1170
00:58:15,809 --> 00:58:17,042
>> YEAH.

1171
00:58:17,044 --> 00:58:18,677
I BET.

1172
00:58:18,679 --> 00:58:19,344
THEY'RE BAD.

1173
00:58:19,346 --> 00:58:22,447
AND SO, SO GOOD.

1174
00:58:22,449 --> 00:58:25,083
>> I BET THEY CAN'T DO IT AGAIN

1175
00:58:25,085 --> 00:58:28,053
IN THE GARDEN RIGHT AFTER LUNCH.

1176
00:58:28,055 --> 00:58:30,422
>> I'LL TAKE THAT BET.

1177
00:58:30,424 --> 00:58:32,424
>> SISTERS, NO GAMBLING.

1178
00:58:32,426 --> 00:58:35,727
WE NEED TO FOCUS ON FINDING THE

1179
00:58:35,729 --> 00:58:40,599
MAN HIDDEN AMONGST US AND FORCE

1180
00:58:40,601 --> 00:58:42,100

1181
00:58:42,102 --> 00:58:44,703
>> YEAH, HE NEED TO REPENT ME

1182
00:58:44,705 --> 00:58:48,440
OVER THE DINING ROOM TABLE

1183
00:58:48,442 --> 00:58:48,774
AGAIN.

1184
00:58:48,776 --> 00:58:50,275
>> WHAT WAS THAT, SISTER

1185
00:58:50,277 --> 00:58:50,642
GENEVIEVE?

1186
00:58:50,644 --> 00:58:51,376
>> I SAID PRESENT.

1187
00:58:51,378 --> 00:58:53,211
>> AND I SAID PRESENT ME WITH

1188
00:58:53,213 --> 00:58:55,547
THAT WEANER AGAIN, AND YOU CAN

1189
00:58:55,549 --> 00:58:58,784
CALL ME JOEY CHESTNUT WITH HOW

1190
00:58:58,786 --> 00:58:59,785
FAST I GOBBLE IT DOWN.

1191
00:58:59,787 --> 00:59:02,254
>> SISTERS, CAN WE PLEASE FOCUS

1192
00:59:02,256 --> 00:59:04,623
ON THE EVIL MAN TRYING TO

1193
00:59:04,625 --> 00:59:06,191
CORRUPT OUR PRECIOUS VIRGIN

1194
00:59:06,193 --> 00:59:08,060
SOULS?

1195
00:59:08,062 --> 00:59:10,028
>> CERTAINLY, THIS MAN OR WOMAN

1196
00:59:10,030 --> 00:59:12,698
IS CLEARLY SO SEXY THAT EVEN GOD

1197
00:59:12,700 --> 00:59:13,732
CANNOT STOP HIM.

1198
00:59:13,734 --> 00:59:16,401
WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT THE

1199
00:59:16,403 --> 00:59:16,735
VIRGINS.

1200
00:59:16,737 --> 00:59:19,338
SPEND TIME WITH THE VIRGINS,

1201
00:59:19,340 --> 00:59:21,707
GIVE THE VIRGINS EVERYTHING WE

1202
00:59:21,709 --> 00:59:22,007
GOT.

1203
00:59:22,009 --> 00:59:24,376
>> BESIDES, I HEARD GOD CAN'T

1204
00:59:24,378 --> 00:59:26,244
SEE IT AS LONG AS YOU DO IT IN

1205
00:59:26,246 --> 00:59:28,880
THE BELL TOWER AND THE MAN USES

1206
00:59:28,882 --> 00:59:33,118
HIS PENIS TO RING THE BELL AND

1207
00:59:33,120 --> 00:59:34,853
YELL DING DONG.

1208
00:59:34,855 --> 00:59:37,456
>> SADLY, DING DONG IS WHAT I

1209
00:59:37,458 --> 00:59:39,491
HEAR ALSO ABOUT THAT MAN.

1210
00:59:39,493 --> 00:59:40,826
>> I DON'T KNOW WHY EVERYONE IS

1211
00:59:40,828 --> 00:59:42,027
NOT MORE OUTRAGED.

1212
00:59:42,029 --> 00:59:46,431
WHOEVER IS AGREEING TO HAVE

1213
00:59:46,433 --> 00:59:50,068
S-E-X WITH THIS MAN IS JUST AS

1214
00:59:50,070 --> 00:59:51,837
GUILTY AS HE IS.

1215
00:59:51,839 --> 00:59:52,704
>> YEAH.

1216
00:59:52,706 --> 00:59:54,773
OR MAYBE THERE'S ONE NUN WHO'S

1217
00:59:54,775 --> 00:59:55,240
GETTING NONE.

1218
00:59:55,242 --> 00:59:56,408
>> EXCUSE ME?

1219
00:59:56,410 --> 00:59:57,376
>> YEAH.

1220
00:59:57,378 --> 01:00:01,713
MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE SHE'S A

1221
01:00:01,715 --> 01:00:03,415
LITTLE STRING BEAN AND WHEN HE

1222
01:00:03,417 --> 01:00:06,585
TRIED TO HIT THE BELL WITH HIS

1223
01:00:06,587 --> 01:00:10,389
PENIS, IT DOESN'T GO DING DONG,

1224
01:00:10,391 --> 01:00:13,358
IT GOES WHOMP WHOMP.

1225
01:00:13,360 --> 01:00:14,192
>> THAT IS ENOUGH!

1226
01:00:14,194 --> 01:00:15,660
I'LL GIVE HIM ONE FINAL CHANCE

1227
01:00:15,662 --> 01:00:16,395
TO CONFESS.

1228
01:00:16,397 --> 01:00:21,233
>> YEAH, CONFESS!

1229
01:00:21,235 --> 01:00:23,402
WHOEVER YOU ARE, YOU BEAUTIFUL

1230
01:00:23,404 --> 01:00:26,972
MONSTER, YOU SEXUAL KING, JUST

1231
01:00:26,974 --> 01:00:30,709
ADMIT WHAT YOU DID.

1232
01:00:36,917 --> 01:00:37,482
>> FINE.

1233
01:00:37,484 --> 01:00:40,919
I CONFESS.

1234
01:00:40,921 --> 01:00:42,187
IT WAS ME.

1235
01:00:42,189 --> 01:00:44,756
I WITH US THE ONE WHO CORRUPTED

1236

01:00:46,894 --> 01:00:51,396
AND MY HIPS, AND I WAS THE ONE

1238
01:00:51,398 --> 01:00:55,200

01:00:55,202 --> 01:00:57,669
AND YELLED DING DONG.

1240
01:00:57,671 --> 01:00:59,938

THIS IS PROBABLY THE WORST SEX

1244
01:01:04,545 --> 01:01:07,946
SCANDAL IN THE HISTORY OF THE

1245
01:01:07,948 --> 01:01:08,280
CHURCH.

1246
01:01:08,282 --> 01:01:10,816
BUT LOOK ON THE BRIGHT SIDE,

SCREAMING, "OH, GOD".

1251
01:01:22,162 --> 01:01:23,962
>> SISTER KEVIN, I'M AFRAID YOU

1252
01:01:23,964 --> 01:01:25,597
MUST LEAVE THIS CONVENT AT ONCE.

1253
01:01:25,599 --> 01:01:28,500

SISTER KEVIN CAN STAY.

01:04:11,965 --> 01:04:12,297
>> YEAH.

1337
01:04:12,299 --> 01:04:13,598
GO AHEAD, ENRIQUE.

1338
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:16,501
>> HIS NAME IS JEFF.

1339
01:04:16,503 --> 01:04:18,803
>> THAT'S AWESOME, MAN.

1340
01:04:18,805 --> 01:04:20,405
HIS NAME IS JEFF, YEAH.

1341
01:04:20,407 --> 01:04:23,108
I'M GLAD YOU'RE IN A GOOD MOOD,

1342
01:04:23,110 --> 01:04:25,010
ENRIQUE, BUT YOU KNOW PEOPLE'S

1343
01:04:25,012 --> 01:04:27,779
JOBS ARE ON THE LINE HERE.

1344
01:04:27,781 --> 01:04:28,179
>> NOT JEFF.

1345
01:04:28,181 --> 01:04:29,047
HE WORKS AT GOOGLE.

1346
01:04:29,049 --> 01:04:30,649
>> OKAY.

1347
01:04:30,651 --> 01:04:32,050
WELL, LUCKY HIM.

1348
01:04:32,052 --> 01:04:35,720
>> NO, LUCKY ME.

1349
01:04:35,722 --> 01:04:37,155
>> ALL RIGHT.

1350
01:04:37,157 --> 01:04:37,455
OKAY.

1351
01:04:37,457 --> 01:04:40,692
LET'S TALK IN PAIRS, COME UP

1352
01:04:40,694 --> 01:04:41,226
WITH IDEAS.

1353
01:04:41,228 --> 01:04:43,094
WE WANT TO RETAIN AS MANY PEOPLE

1354
01:04:43,096 --> 01:04:45,530
AS WE CAN, SO WE NEED A GOOD

1355
01:04:45,532 --> 01:04:45,930
PITCH HERE.

1356
01:04:45,932 --> 01:04:48,667
>> SHE JUST DON'T HAVE THE BEE

1357
01:04:48,669 --> 01:04:49,034
EXPERTISE.

1358
01:04:49,036 --> 01:04:51,469
THE MORE WE HANDLE OURSELVES,

1359
01:04:51,471 --> 01:04:52,904
THE BETTER THEY'LL DO.

1360
01:04:52,906 --> 01:04:54,105
>> WRITE THAT DOWN.

1361
01:04:54,107 --> 01:04:56,341
>> OUR SALES ARE GREAT.

1362
01:04:56,343 --> 01:04:57,842
WE'RE IN EVERY DRUGSTORE YOU CAN

1363
01:04:57,844 --> 01:04:59,711
THINK OF.

1364
01:04:59,713 --> 01:05:00,912
>> THEY WERE FRIENDS WHEN THEY

1365
01:05:00,914 --> 01:05:01,746
WERE KIDS.

1366
01:05:01,748 --> 01:05:03,682
THEY DRIFTED APART, AND THEN

1367
01:05:03,684 --> 01:05:04,582
THEY CAME BACK TOGETHER.

1368
01:05:04,584 --> 01:05:05,617
>> WELL, THAT'S ADORABLE.

1369
01:05:05,619 --> 01:05:08,186
>> I MEAN, YOU CAME UP WITH THE

1370
01:05:08,188 --> 01:05:08,586
FOOT SCRUB.

1371
01:05:08,588 --> 01:05:09,621
YOU HAVE TO STAY.

1372
01:05:09,623 --> 01:05:13,458
>> AND YOU BROUGHT IN

1373
01:05:13,460 --> 01:05:15,060
EXFOLIATING.

1374
01:05:15,062 --> 01:05:15,493
THAT'S HUGE.

1375
01:05:15,495 --> 01:05:18,496
>> MY SPEECH IS FUNNY, BUT NICE

1376
01:05:18,498 --> 01:05:18,830
FUNNY.

1377
01:05:18,832 --> 01:05:20,231
>> THAT'S HOW YOU GOT TO DO IT.

1378
01:05:20,233 --> 01:05:21,800
>> ALL RIGHT, GUYS.

1379
01:05:21,802 --> 01:05:24,135
LET'S COME BACK.

1380
01:05:24,137 --> 01:05:26,004
WHAT DID WE ALL COME UP WITH?

1381
01:05:26,006 --> 01:05:30,809
WHAT QUESTIONS DO WE NEED TO

1382
01:05:30,811 --> 01:05:32,143
ANSWER TODAY?

1383
01:05:32,145 --> 01:05:32,844
>> WELL, OUR BIGGEST QUESTION

1384
01:05:32,846 --> 01:05:33,611
RIGHT NOW IS BAND OR DJ BECAUSE

1385
01:05:33,613 --> 01:05:35,447
THE DJ IS CHEAPER, BUT THE

1386
01:05:35,449 --> 01:05:35,814
BAND --

1387
01:05:35,816 --> 01:05:37,482
>> THE BAND IS LIKE WHOA.

1388
01:05:37,484 --> 01:05:41,920
>> OKAY, GUYS, LET'S FOCUS HERE.

1389
01:05:41,922 --> 01:05:43,254
ENRIQUE, WHAT WAS OUR OVERHEAD

1390
01:05:43,256 --> 01:05:44,856
FOR THE PAST FOUR QUARTERS?

1391
01:05:44,858 --> 01:05:45,490
>> I DON'T KNOW.

1392
01:05:45,492 --> 01:05:46,191
DON'T ASK ME.

1393
01:05:46,193 --> 01:05:49,260
>> WELL, YOU'RE OUR ACCOUNTANT,

1394
01:05:49,262 --> 01:05:49,527
BUD.

1395
01:05:49,529 --> 01:05:51,429
I DON'T KNOW WHO ELSE TO ASK.

1396
01:05:51,431 --> 01:05:53,498
LOOK, I'M VERY HAPPY FOR YOU,

1397
01:05:53,500 --> 01:05:56,568
BUT I FEEL LIKE YOU'RE A LITTLE

1398
01:05:56,570 --> 01:05:57,602
DISTRACTED, ENRIQUE.

1399
01:05:57,604 --> 01:05:59,371
>> AND WHY SHOULDN'T HE BE?

1400
01:05:59,373 --> 01:06:00,405
HE'S HAPPY.

1401
01:06:00,407 --> 01:06:02,140
>> BECAUSE OUR COMPANY IS ON THE

1402
01:06:02,142 --> 01:06:02,440
LINE.

1403
01:06:02,442 --> 01:06:03,608
>> JUST BECAUSE YOUR DAUGHTER

1404
01:06:03,610 --> 01:06:06,644
CAN'T KEEP A MAN.

1405
01:06:06,646 --> 01:06:07,645
>> SHE'S 6.

1406
01:06:07,647 --> 01:06:08,179
>> WELL, SHE'S TALL.

1407
01:06:08,181 --> 01:06:10,482
I DIDN'T KNOW.

1408
01:06:10,484 --> 01:06:13,852
>> GUYS, GUYS.

1409
01:06:13,854 --> 01:06:15,553
THIS IS IMPORTANT.

1410
01:06:15,555 --> 01:06:17,856
OUR COMPANY IS BELOVED, OKAY?

1411
01:06:17,858 --> 01:06:20,625
WE GRIND UP BEES AND TURN IT

1412
01:06:20,627 --> 01:06:22,060
INTO CHAPSTICK.

1413
01:06:22,062 --> 01:06:24,162
PEOPLE LOVE THAT.

1414
01:06:24,164 --> 01:06:26,898
SO WHEN THOSE SUITS FROM JERGENS

1415
01:06:26,900 --> 01:06:29,701
COME IN HERE AND THEY SAY, SORRY

1416
01:06:29,703 --> 01:06:31,569
TO BREAK IT TO YOU, BUT YOU HAVE

1417
01:06:31,571 --> 01:06:34,606
TO LAY OFF 30% OF YOUR STAFF,

1418
01:06:34,608 --> 01:06:35,874
WHAT ARE WE GOING TO SAY?

1419
01:06:35,876 --> 01:06:37,409
>> WE'RE GOING TO SAY NO.

1420
01:06:37,411 --> 01:06:38,276
>> NOT TODAY.

1421
01:06:38,278 --> 01:06:39,377
>> BECAUSE HIS DAUGHTER'S

1422
01:06:39,379 --> 01:06:40,078
GETTING MARRIED.

1423
01:06:40,080 --> 01:06:41,012
>> YEAH.

1424
01:06:41,014 --> 01:06:42,447
SO WE'RE NOT DOING ALL OF THAT.

1425
01:06:42,449 --> 01:06:44,215
>> BECAUSE WE HAVE A WEDDING TO

1426
01:06:44,217 --> 01:06:44,849
PAY FOR.

1427
01:06:44,851 --> 01:06:47,252
>> BECAUSE WE ARE A FAMILY.

1428
01:06:47,254 --> 01:06:49,387
>> AND IF JERGENS HAS A PROBLEM

1429
01:06:49,389 --> 01:06:50,255
WITH THAT --

1430
01:06:50,257 --> 01:06:52,490
>> THEN THEY CAN GO STRAIGHT TO

1431
01:06:52,492 --> 01:06:52,791
HELL.

1432
01:06:52,793 --> 01:06:54,259
RIGHT, ENRIQUE?

1433
01:06:54,261 --> 01:06:56,628
>> CAN I SAY ONE MORE THING?

1434
01:06:56,630 --> 01:06:56,995
>> YEP.

1435
01:06:56,997 --> 01:06:59,931
>> MY SON IS HAVING A BABY.

1436
01:06:59,933 --> 01:07:00,799
>> YES, ENRIQUE!

1437
01:07:00,801 --> 01:07:06,805
>> YEA!

1438
01:07:26,859 --> 01:07:30,094
PASCAL.

1439
01:07:30,096 --> 01:07:32,197
THANK YOU TO MICK JAGGER, AND

1440
01:07:32,199 --> 01:07:38,002

1441
01:07:38,004 --> 01:07:40,305
WELL, THANK YOU TO LAUREN AND

I HAD A GREAT WEEK.

1444
01:07:42,609 --> 01:07:44,676
