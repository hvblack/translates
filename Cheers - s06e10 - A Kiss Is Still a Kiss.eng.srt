1
00:00:05,074 --> 00:00:06,747
BARKEEP, A BEER.

2
00:00:06,747 --> 00:00:09,489
UH-OH.
FLIMFLAM ALERT.

3
00:00:09,489 --> 00:00:11,523
HEY, GUYS.

4
00:00:11,523 --> 00:00:13,259
SEE YOU

5
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:15,017
HOW LONG'S
IT BEEN?

6
00:00:15,017 --> 00:00:18,523
2 TO 10, WITH TIME OFF
FOR GOOD BEHAVIOR.

7
00:00:20,189 --> 00:00:22,551
I NEED CHANGE
FOR THIS 50.

8
00:00:22,551 --> 00:00:25,604
MAYBE I CAN HELP YOU.

9
00:00:25,604 --> 00:00:26,951
GREAT.

10
00:00:26,951 --> 00:00:28,811
HOLD IT, HOLD IT.

11
00:00:28,811 --> 00:00:32,575
COME ON, GUYS,
GIVE ME A BREAK.
I'M REFORMED.

12
00:00:32,575 --> 00:00:36,777
OH, YEAH?
WOULD YOU MIND
IF WE MONITORED
THIS TRANSACTION?

13
00:00:36,777 --> 00:00:38,839
WOULDN'T MIND AT ALL.

14
00:00:40,609 --> 00:00:42,383
OK, YOU'VE
GOT 50 BUCKS.

15
00:00:42,383 --> 00:00:44,610
HERE'S 1, 2...
3, 4, 5...

16
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:46,194
NORM, WHAT'S
THE TIME?
11.

17
00:00:46,194 --> 00:00:48,245
11, 12, 13, 14...

18
00:00:48,245 --> 00:00:51,243
I'VE GOT 11:25.

19
00:00:51,243 --> 00:00:53,188
26, 27, 28...

20
00:00:53,188 --> 00:00:54,797
CLIFF,

21
00:00:54,797 --> 00:00:56,523
HOW OLD ARE YOU?
39.

22
00:00:56,523 --> 00:00:58,762
39! 40, 41, 42...

23
00:00:58,762 --> 00:01:00,641
WAIT.

24
00:01:00,641 --> 00:01:01,933
WHEN WERE YOU BORN?
'47.

25
00:01:01,933 --> 00:01:03,216
48, 49, 50.

26
00:01:03,216 --> 00:01:05,080
THERE YOU GO, BARKEEP.
THANK YOU.

27
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:07,398
SEE YOU.
SURE.

28
00:01:08,337 --> 00:01:11,432
SAM, LONG TIME
NO SEE.

29
00:01:12,029 --> 00:01:14,189
WHAT WAS HARRY THE HAT
DOING HERE?

30
00:01:14,189 --> 00:01:16,717
HE WANTED A BEER.
OH.

31
00:01:16,717 --> 00:01:19,699
AND SOME CHANGE.
OH!

32
00:01:25,705 --> 00:01:27,840
* MAKIN' YOUR WAY
IN THE WORLD TODAY *

33
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:31,110
* TAKES EVERYTHING
YOU'VE GOT *

34
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:33,513
* TAKIN' A BREAK
FROM ALL YOUR WORRIES *

35
00:01:33,613 --> 00:01:35,981
* SURE WOULD
HELP A LOT *

36
00:01:37,249 --> 00:01:39,819
* WOULDN'T YOU LIKE
TO GET AWAY *

37
00:01:42,822 --> 00:01:44,857
* SOMETIMES
YOU WANNA GO *

38
00:01:44,957 --> 00:01:48,060
* WHERE EVERYBODY
KNOWS YOUR NAME *

39
00:01:50,262 --> 00:01:53,198
* AND THEY'RE ALWAYS
GLAD YOU CAME *

40
00:01:55,067 --> 00:01:57,236
* YOU WANNA BE
WHERE YOU CAN SEE *

41
00:01:57,336 --> 00:01:59,684
* OUR TROUBLES
ARE ALL THE SAME *

42
00:01:59,684 --> 00:02:03,643
* YOU WANNA BE
* WHERE EVERYBODY
KNOWS YOUR NAME *

43
00:02:05,244 --> 00:02:07,613
* YOU WANNA GO
WHERE PEOPLE KNOW *

44
00:02:07,713 --> 00:02:10,259
* PEOPLE ARE
ALL THE SAME *

45
00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:15,921
* YOU WANNA GO
* WHERE EVERYBODY
KNOWS YOUR NAME *

46
00:02:32,586 --> 00:02:35,289
AFTERNOON,
EVERYBODY.

47
00:02:35,389 --> 00:02:36,590
HOW'S LIFE
TREATING YOU?

48
00:02:36,691 --> 00:02:39,994
IT'S NOT,
BUT THAT DOESN'T
MEAN YOU CAN'T.

49
00:02:40,594 --> 00:02:42,530
I'D LOVE TO,

50
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:44,465
BUT I DON'T HAVE
A DIME.

51
00:02:44,565 --> 00:02:46,601
MY BOAT SANK--

52
00:02:46,601 --> 00:02:48,102
THE BOTTOM
OF THE CARIBBEAN.

53
00:02:48,102 --> 00:02:52,189
IS THAT THE 17th
OR 18th TIME WE'VE
HEARD THAT SPEECH?

54
00:02:52,913 --> 00:02:56,877
THAT WAS GREAT
MEATLOAF LAST NIGHT, HUH?

55
00:02:56,877 --> 00:02:58,112
IT WAS.

56
00:02:58,112 --> 00:03:00,949
YOU KNOW,
WE'VE GOT TO TALK.

57
00:03:01,049 --> 00:03:04,261
I DON'T MIND YOU
STAYING WITH US
TILL YOU GET
YOUR NEW PLACE,

58
00:03:04,261 --> 00:03:06,856
BUT IT'S A PROBLEM
FOR VERA.

59
00:03:06,856 --> 00:03:08,897
THE WAY YOU LEAVE
THE DISHES, THE BED,

60
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:11,525
THE BATHROOM...

61
00:03:11,526 --> 00:03:14,861
YOU'VE GOT TO LEAVE
SOMETHING
FOR HER TO DO.

62
00:03:15,363 --> 00:03:18,366
SHE WANTS TO SPEND
TIME WITH ME.

63
00:03:21,936 --> 00:03:23,615
BOOZE, AND QUICKLY.

64
00:03:23,615 --> 00:03:24,869
WHAT'S THE MATTER,
DR. CRANE?

65
00:03:24,869 --> 00:03:26,697
OH, I'M DEVASTATED.

66
00:03:26,697 --> 00:03:30,252
I NEED
SOMETHING TO NUMB
MY SENSIBILITIES

67
00:03:30,252 --> 00:03:32,887
AND BLAST ME
INTO SWEET OBLIVION.

68
00:03:32,981 --> 00:03:36,257
A BOILERMAKER?
A MIMOSA.

69
00:03:38,953 --> 00:03:40,688
WHAT'S GOT YOU UPSET?

70
00:03:40,789 --> 00:03:43,101
SOME COLLEGE PROFESSOR
PUBLISHED AN ARTICLE

71
00:03:43,101 --> 00:03:44,993
THAT REFUTES
MY LAST PAPER.

72
00:03:44,993 --> 00:03:48,285
A SHOOT-OUT
AT THE CUCKOO CORRAL.

73
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:52,500
WHAT COULD MOTIVATE
AN HONORED AND
DISTINGUISHED COLLEAGUE

74
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:55,168
TO LAUNCH
A PERSONAL ATTACK?

75
00:03:55,168 --> 00:03:59,211
MAYBE IT'S JUST
A HONEST DIFFERENCE
OF OPINION
BETWEEN SCHOLARS.

76
00:03:59,211 --> 00:04:02,051
GOOSE POOPS.
THE MAN'S A YAHOO.

77
00:04:04,846 --> 00:04:06,514
HEY, SAMMY.

78
00:04:06,614 --> 00:04:09,784
WANT TO SEE WHAT MAKES
REBECCA'S LOINS ACHE?

79
00:04:09,784 --> 00:04:12,453
SURE.
HE JUST
WALKED IN.

80
00:04:12,553 --> 00:04:15,081
THE GREAT
AND POWERFUL
EVAN DRAKE.

81
00:04:15,081 --> 00:04:17,558
RESERVED MY TABLE
UPSTAIRS?

82
00:04:17,558 --> 00:04:21,427
SHE'S SKIPPING
THE THRILL RIDES
AT SAMMYLAND
FOR THAT?

83
00:04:23,732 --> 00:04:27,068
WHILE I THINK OF IT,
SEND THAT TELEX
TO PARIS.

84
00:04:27,068 --> 00:04:28,324
FIRST THING TOMORROW.

85
00:04:28,324 --> 00:04:31,161
NOW.
YES, SIR.

86
00:04:31,506 --> 00:04:33,026
WHAT DOES SHE
SEE IN HIM?

87
00:04:33,026 --> 00:04:35,443
MONEY, POWER,
PRESTIGE.

88
00:04:35,543 --> 00:04:38,618
YEAH, BUT I'M SEVERAL
INCHES TALLER THAN HIM.

89
00:04:39,981 --> 00:04:42,082
SAM MALONE.

90
00:04:42,082 --> 00:04:43,470
EVAN DRAKE.

91
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:46,988
HOW DO YOU DO?
I WAS A BIG FAN.

92
00:04:46,988 --> 00:04:49,023
ANY FAN OF MINE
IS CERTAINLY
WELCOME HERE,

93
00:04:49,123 --> 00:04:51,904
ESPECIALLY ONE
WHO COULD
FIRE ME.

94
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:53,762
WHAT
WOULD YOU LIKE?

95
00:04:53,762 --> 00:04:55,463
YOU GOT SOME
20-YEAR-OLD SCOTCH?

96
00:04:55,463 --> 00:04:58,676
NO. WE GOT PRETZELS
BEEN AROUND A WHILE.

97
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:02,047
HOW ABOUT A DEWAR'S?
THAT WILL DO IT.

98
00:05:02,047 --> 00:05:04,873
SO...
MR. DRAKE,

99
00:05:04,873 --> 00:05:07,144
THINGS ARE GOING
PRETTY GOOD
AT THE BAR.

100
00:05:07,144 --> 00:05:09,951
WE SINK A LOT
OF BUCKS INTO IT.

101
00:05:09,951 --> 00:05:13,147
SPEAKING OF SINKING,
I LOST MY BOAT--

102
00:05:13,147 --> 00:05:14,835
YEAH, I HEARD.

103
00:05:20,421 --> 00:05:22,857
I REMEMBER
WATCHING YOU PITCH.

104
00:05:22,857 --> 00:05:24,941
I'LL BET YOU GOT
LOTS OF GREAT STORIES.

105
00:05:24,941 --> 00:05:28,329
HOLD STILL.
I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.

106
00:05:28,429 --> 00:05:30,854
MR. DRAKE, THEY'RE
READY FOR YOU UPSTAIRS.

107
00:05:30,854 --> 00:05:33,250
I'LL TELL THEM TO WAIT.

108
00:05:34,068 --> 00:05:38,534
YOU KNOW HOW
PEOPLE ARE ALWAYS
CATCHING YOU NAKED
WHEN YOU DON'T
WANT THEM TO?

109
00:05:39,841 --> 00:05:41,594
LET'S SETTLE
AN ARGUMENT.

110
00:05:41,594 --> 00:05:45,085
HOW MUCH
DOES HE PAY
FOR HIS SOCKS?

111
00:05:46,548 --> 00:05:49,312
I'VE SEEN THOSE
AT BARNEY'S.

112
00:05:49,312 --> 00:05:51,956
THEY'RE ABOUT
75 A PAIR.

113
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:55,589
EVEN I PAY A DOLLAR
FOR MINE.

114
00:05:59,327 --> 00:06:01,930
SO THERE I AM
IN THE LOCKER ROOM

115
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:04,927
SIGNING THIS GUY'S
GAME BALL
BUCK NAKED.

116
00:06:04,927 --> 00:06:07,969
I'LL NEVER
FORGET HIS NAME.

117
00:06:08,069 --> 00:06:09,911
UBERROTH.

118
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:12,941
PETER UBERROTH,
THE BASEBALL
COMMISSIONER?

119
00:06:13,041 --> 00:06:15,709
THAT'S WHERE THE STORY
KIND OF FALLS APART.

120
00:06:15,809 --> 00:06:18,446
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

121
00:06:18,546 --> 00:06:22,172
WHERE YOU BEEN?
I HAD TO
CHANGE A FLAT.

122
00:06:22,172 --> 00:06:26,154
MR. DRAKE'S HERE.
CARLA, DON'T
JOKE ABOUT THAT.

123
00:06:26,154 --> 00:06:27,788
HELLO, MR. DRAKE.

124
00:06:27,888 --> 00:06:29,223
AAH! OH MY GOD.

125
00:06:29,223 --> 00:06:31,425
I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU'D BE HERE.

126
00:06:31,525 --> 00:06:32,927
CLOSE YOUR EYES!

127
00:06:32,927 --> 00:06:34,912
NOT YOU, WOODY.

128
00:06:37,632 --> 00:06:40,401
ATTRACTIVE WOMAN.
A LITTLE JUMPY, THOUGH.

129
00:06:40,401 --> 00:06:43,481
BUT SHE MAKES IT
WORK SOMEHOW,
DOESN'T SHE?

130
00:06:43,872 --> 00:06:46,680
SOME GUYS AT CORPORATE
ASKED HER OUT.

131
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,512
SHE ALWAYS
SHOT THEM DOWN.

132
00:06:48,512 --> 00:06:50,284
YOU TRIED, YET?

133
00:06:50,284 --> 00:06:54,648
OH, NO. I DON'T DATE
PEOPLE I WORK WITH.

134
00:06:54,648 --> 00:06:57,766
STRUCK OUT?
EVERY TIME.

135
00:06:59,654 --> 00:07:04,792
YEAH, YOU KNOW...
SOME GUYS IN THE OFFICE
THINKS SHE'S A...

136
00:07:04,793 --> 00:07:08,917
WHAT?
A...LADIES' LADY.

137
00:07:12,066 --> 00:07:15,854
OH, NO, NO. I CAN'T
BELIEVE IT.

138
00:07:15,854 --> 00:07:17,655
I'M SO SORRY,
MR. DRAKE.

139
00:07:17,755 --> 00:07:19,390
I WOULD'VE
BEEN HERE SOONER,

140
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:22,381
BUT I WAS
WORKING ON MY CAR.

141
00:07:30,301 --> 00:07:32,989
WELL, I'VE GOT
A LUNCH PARTNER.

142
00:07:32,989 --> 00:07:36,975
WELL, IT'S REALLY NICE
TO SEE YOU AGAIN,

143
00:07:37,075 --> 00:07:39,443
EVEN IF IT WAS
FOR A SHORT WHILE.

144
00:07:39,543 --> 00:07:43,915
OH, BY THE WAY,
I'M HOSTING A PARTY
FRIDAY NIGHT.

145
00:07:44,015 --> 00:07:45,651
I'D LOVE
TO HAVE YOU.

146
00:07:45,651 --> 00:07:47,986
OH, MR. DRAKE,
I'D--I'D--I'D---

147
00:07:48,086 --> 00:07:50,461
REALLY LOVE THAT.

148
00:07:50,461 --> 00:07:53,424
UH, 8:00. MY CLUB.
BLACK TIE.

149
00:07:53,524 --> 00:07:57,261
YEAH,
HERE'S THE ADDRESS.
AND BRING A DATE.

150
00:07:57,361 --> 00:08:00,593
UH, OR A COMPANION.
OR WHATEVER.

151
00:08:00,593 --> 00:08:02,290
SAM.

152
00:08:07,171 --> 00:08:11,742
I WONDER
WHAT HE MEANT
BY A "COMPANION
OR WHATEVER."

153
00:08:11,842 --> 00:08:13,438
WHO KNOWS?

154
00:08:15,813 --> 00:08:17,882
WHAT'S SO FUNNY?

155
00:08:17,982 --> 00:08:20,885
WELL, IT SEEMS THAT
THE LOVE OF YOUR LIFE

156
00:08:20,985 --> 00:08:23,390
THINKS THAT BECAUSE
HE'S NEVER SEEN YOU
DATE ANYBODY,

157
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:25,356
MAYBE YOU...

158
00:08:25,456 --> 00:08:28,398
WELL, PREFER LADIES.

159
00:08:29,293 --> 00:08:31,595
WELL, YOU--YOU
SET HIM STRAIGHT,
DIDN'T YOU?

160
00:08:31,695 --> 00:08:33,908
BASED ON WHAT?

161
00:08:38,102 --> 00:08:39,670
I--I CAN'T
BELIEVE THIS.

162
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:41,906
HE'S ALL I EVER
THINK ABOUT
AND NOW HE THINKS I--

163
00:08:42,006 --> 00:08:44,907
YEAH, IT'S
A NUTTY WORLD, ISN'T IT?

164
00:08:46,777 --> 00:08:50,766
YOU KNOW SOMTHING,
THOUGH,
I'LL BET YOU COULD
CHANGE HIS MIND

165
00:08:50,766 --> 00:08:52,418
IF YOU SHOWED UP
AT HIS PARTY

166
00:08:52,418 --> 00:08:58,794
WITH THIS INCREDIBLY
GOOD-LOOKING,
HOT, MACHO STUD.

167
00:08:58,794 --> 00:09:03,661
YOU, FOR INSTANCE?
YOU RECOGNIZED
THE DESCRIPTION.

168
00:09:04,062 --> 00:09:07,513
JUST BECAUSE
I PUT MY WORK FIRST

169
00:09:07,513 --> 00:09:10,355
DOES NOT MEAN
I DON'T HAVE BOYFRIENDS.

170
00:09:10,355 --> 00:09:12,855
I COULD HAVE A DOZEN DATES
FOR FRIDAY NIGHT.

171
00:09:12,855 --> 00:09:14,987
ONE AS GREAT-LOOKING
AS ME?

172
00:09:14,987 --> 00:09:19,528
BLINDFOLDED, GAGGED,
WITH MY HANDS
TIED BEHIND ME.

173
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:25,602
WE WERE JUST TALKING
ABOUT A PARTY
FRIDAY NIGHT.

174
00:09:27,303 --> 00:09:31,214
SAMMY,
WHERE IS IT
AND WHAT TIME?

175
00:09:36,194 --> 00:09:37,895
HEY.

176
00:09:37,996 --> 00:09:41,316
HEY, CAN I GET
A GLASS OF WATER?

177
00:09:42,934 --> 00:09:44,200
GOT THE HICCUPS,
HUH?

178
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:47,574
YES, IT'S MERELY
PSYCHOSOMATIC.

179
00:09:47,671 --> 00:09:52,010
I GUESS I'M STILL
UPSET ABOUT THAT
JOURNALISTIC
STAB IN THE BACK.

180
00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:53,978
PUT A BAG
OVER YOUR HEAD.

181
00:09:54,078 --> 00:09:55,713
NO, I'D LOOK
RIDICULOUS.

182
00:09:55,813 --> 00:09:58,552
I'LL JUST DO WHAT
MY MOTHER TAUGHT ME.

183
00:10:03,822 --> 00:10:07,134
OH, YEAH,
YOU'RE RIGHT,
THE BAG
WOULD LOOK SILLY.

184
00:10:09,968 --> 00:10:11,772
THERE.

185
00:10:11,772 --> 00:10:13,384
HICCUP! OH, DAMN.

186
00:10:17,235 --> 00:10:19,703
WOW, MS. HOWE,

187
00:10:19,703 --> 00:10:23,233
YOU LOOK PRETTY ENOUGH
TO TAKE TO A BARN DANCE.

188
00:10:23,233 --> 00:10:25,396
THANK YOU.

189
00:10:27,245 --> 00:10:29,880
SAM, WHEN I'M GONE
TONIGHT, I WANT--

190
00:10:32,183 --> 00:10:34,152
WHY ARE YOU
WEARING A TUXEDO?

191
00:10:34,252 --> 00:10:37,063
WHY DOES SUPERMAN
WEAR A CAPE?

192
00:10:38,356 --> 00:10:39,823
TO RESCUE PEOPLE.

193
00:10:39,923 --> 00:10:43,394
THIS IS YOUR BIG
PARTY NIGHT,
ISN'T IT?
YES.

194
00:10:43,494 --> 00:10:45,731
YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO INVITE SOMEBODY?

195
00:10:45,731 --> 00:10:48,832
YES...
HIS NAME IS RYAN.
OH, REALLY?

196
00:10:48,932 --> 00:10:51,387
YES, AND IT WASN'T
AN EASY DECISION.

197
00:10:51,387 --> 00:10:54,884
I'D ASK STEVE,
BUT HE'S IN NEW YORK,

198
00:10:54,884 --> 00:10:58,093
AND JEAN-PIERRE
IS A BORE.

199
00:10:59,377 --> 00:11:02,053
KEEP HUMMING.
KEEP HUMMING.

200
00:11:02,053 --> 00:11:04,313
KEEP IT UP.

201
00:11:07,685 --> 00:11:10,065
I THINK IT WORKED.

202
00:11:11,555 --> 00:11:14,374
FRASIER,
I'M TELLING YOU,
PUT A BAG
ON YOUR HEAD.

203
00:11:14,374 --> 00:11:18,796
I'M NOT PUTTING
ANY BAG--HICCUP!

204
00:11:18,896 --> 00:11:21,232
HICCUP--GIVE ME
THE DAMN BAG.

205
00:11:22,375 --> 00:11:26,659
YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE
I FOUND WORKS
IS PUTTING A LEMON
IN YOUR MOUTH.

206
00:11:26,659 --> 00:11:29,676
YOU CAN GET
A WHOLE LEMON
IN YOUR MOUTH?

207
00:11:29,676 --> 00:11:35,058
WELL, YOUNG MAN,
LET'S TAKE A TRIP
TO MR. WIZARD'S
LABORATORY.

208
00:11:38,555 --> 00:11:39,850
WOODY?

209
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:42,997
WHAT'S THIS MESSAGE,
"URGENT. SEE WOODY."

210
00:11:43,287 --> 00:11:47,984
OH, RIGHT. UM...
RYAN FROM
THE ESCORT SERVICE CALLED.

211
00:11:47,984 --> 00:11:51,195
SAID THERE
WAS A MISTAKE
AND CAN'T
MAKE IT TONIGHT.

212
00:11:51,295 --> 00:11:55,074
SAID TO BE
DISCREET ABOUT IT.
THAT'S WHY I WROTE
THE NOTE THAT WAY.

213
00:11:59,237 --> 00:12:02,571
SWEETHEART,
CAN YOU HELP ME
WITH MY CUFF LINKS?

214
00:12:03,675 --> 00:12:07,454
SAM, YOU ARE NOT
GOING WITH ME.

215
00:12:07,454 --> 00:12:13,056
YOU COULDN'T
GET A DATE FROM
AN ESCORT SERVICE?

216
00:12:13,984 --> 00:12:15,435
NOT GOING

217
00:12:15,435 --> 00:12:19,047
THERE ARE PEOPLE
WHO HANG OUT HERE
I'D RATHER
BEEN SEEN WITH.

218
00:12:23,821 --> 00:12:27,684
DR. CRANE WOULD ENJOY
A STYLISH EVENING
WITH REFINED COMPANY.

219
00:12:27,684 --> 00:12:30,812
I'M CURED!
I THINK I'M CURED!

220
00:12:31,897 --> 00:12:36,539
JUST REMEMBER NOW,
I DON'T GO ALL THE WAY
ON THE FIRST DATE.

221
00:13:00,498 --> 00:13:03,318
DO YOU THINK
THAT'S HER?

222
00:13:04,667 --> 00:13:08,872
THIS IS RIDICULOUS.
WHY DON'T YOU LET ME
FRESHEN YOUR DRINK,

223
00:13:08,972 --> 00:13:10,927
AND I'LL FIND OUT
IF THAT'S HIS WIFE.

224
00:13:10,927 --> 00:13:12,510
I'M NOT EVEN THIRSTY.

225
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:14,786
DON'T BE OBVIOUS.

226
00:13:19,017 --> 00:13:21,723
UH, DO THAT AGAIN,
WILL YOU, PARTNER?

227
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:26,566
NICE PARTY.
GLAD YOU LIKE IT.

228
00:13:26,566 --> 00:13:29,727
GUESS I WAS OFF BASE
ABOUT REBECCA, WASN'T I?

229
00:13:29,827 --> 00:13:31,395
OH, YEAH. WAY OFF.

230
00:13:31,495 --> 00:13:35,989
ON THE WAY OVER
IN THE CAR,
SHE WAS ALL OVER ME
LIKE A CAT IN HEAT.

231
00:13:38,402 --> 00:13:40,443
INTERESTING.

232
00:13:40,443 --> 00:13:43,365
I HAVEN'T
MET YOUR WIFE.

233
00:13:43,365 --> 00:13:46,410
OH, NO. THAT'S--
THAT'S NOT HER.

234
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:48,479
SHE'S IN BORA BORA.

235
00:13:48,479 --> 00:13:50,680
OH. VISITING FAMILY?

236
00:13:53,051 --> 00:13:56,982
NO, ACTUALLY,
WE'RE, UH...
WE'RE SEPARATED, SAM.

237
00:13:56,982 --> 00:14:01,388
OH, THAT'S TOO BAD,
'CAUSE SHE'S MISSING
A HECK OF A PARTY.

238
00:14:01,388 --> 00:14:03,326
WELL, THANKS A LOT.

239
00:14:06,163 --> 00:14:09,233
WELL?
SHE'S IN BORA BORA.

240
00:14:09,333 --> 00:14:11,214
THEY'RE SEPARATED.

241
00:14:11,214 --> 00:14:14,872
I KNEW IT.
I KNEW IT,
I KNEW IT.

242
00:14:14,872 --> 00:14:17,545
I'LL TELL YOU.
I'M A LITTLE CONFUSED HERE.

243
00:14:17,545 --> 00:14:20,244
THE RED SAUCE
IS FOR SHRIMP,
MUSTARD'S
FOR THE EGGROLL.

244
00:14:20,244 --> 00:14:22,911
THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEANT,
BUT THANKS.

245
00:14:22,911 --> 00:14:27,353
WHY HAVEN'T YOU
MADE A PLAY FOR HIM?

246
00:14:27,353 --> 00:14:28,926
HOW LONG YOU BEEN
CARRYING A TORCH?

247
00:14:28,926 --> 00:14:33,840
WHAT A SILLY
EXPRESSION.
I AM NOT
CARRYING A TORCH.

248
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:36,085
TWO YEARS.

249
00:14:37,195 --> 00:14:41,219
TWO YEARS?
YOU HAVEN'T DATED?

250
00:14:41,219 --> 00:14:45,569
YOU HAVEN'T
DONE ANYTHING
WITH ANYBODY
FOR TWO YEARS?

251
00:14:45,569 --> 00:14:49,226
MY GOD, WHAT HAPPENS
TO A PERSON'S BODY?

252
00:14:49,226 --> 00:14:54,208
YOU HAVEN'T
GIVEN A CLUE?
YOU DIDN'T TELL HIM
HOW YOU FEEL
OR ANYTHING?

253
00:14:54,875 --> 00:14:58,819
SWEETHEART, YOU GOT
TO TELL HIM TONIGHT

254
00:14:58,819 --> 00:15:01,959
BEFORE YOU EXPLODE
OR SOMETHING.

255
00:15:02,708 --> 00:15:05,700
I CAN'T. I WOULDN'T
KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

256
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:10,694
WELL, HELL--
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.
LET'S REHEARSE IT
RIGHT HERE--
JUST US TWO.

257
00:15:10,794 --> 00:15:13,448
YOU REALLY THINK
IT'LL WORK?

258
00:15:13,448 --> 00:15:17,954
JUST PRETEND
I'M MR. DRAKE,
AND YOU'RE
GOING TO TELL ME.

259
00:15:17,954 --> 00:15:19,767
OK.

260
00:15:19,767 --> 00:15:21,821
OK.

261
00:15:22,573 --> 00:15:24,804
MR. DRAKE...
NO, WAIT.

262
00:15:24,804 --> 00:15:26,824
EVAN.

263
00:15:27,377 --> 00:15:28,473
EVAN...

264
00:15:28,473 --> 00:15:31,532
NO, NO.
WITH FEELING.

265
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,721
EVAN.

266
00:15:36,186 --> 00:15:38,055
THAT'S GOOD.

267
00:15:38,155 --> 00:15:41,465
NOW RUN YOUR HAND
UP MY THIGH.

268
00:15:41,825 --> 00:15:46,617
WAIT A MINUTE.
TRUST ME. GUYS THINK
THAT'S CHARMING.

269
00:15:46,617 --> 00:15:48,481
I JUST WANT
TO LEAVE.

270
00:15:48,481 --> 00:15:52,745
NO, LISTEN.
YOU'LL NEVER FIND
A BETTER TIME
THAN THIS.

271
00:15:52,745 --> 00:15:55,172
HE JUST SEPARATED
WITH HIS WIFE.

272
00:15:55,272 --> 00:15:58,108
HE'S HERE ALONE.
YOU LOOK TERRIFIC.

273
00:15:58,208 --> 00:16:01,579
CALL ME CRAZY,
BUT THIS COULD BE
THE PERFECT MOMENT.

274
00:16:01,579 --> 00:16:06,164
YOU'RE RIGHT.
I HAVE TO
SEIZE THE MOMENT.

275
00:16:06,164 --> 00:16:08,222
THERE YOU GO.

276
00:16:09,087 --> 00:16:10,754
GOOD GIRL.

277
00:16:15,193 --> 00:16:18,996
MR. DRAKE?
YES, REBECCA.

278
00:16:18,996 --> 00:16:20,992
TAKE ME.

279
00:16:24,602 --> 00:16:27,304
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
I'M SORRY.

280
00:16:27,304 --> 00:16:30,007
SHE SHOULD GO HOME.
I DON'T--

281
00:16:30,007 --> 00:16:31,850
GOOD NIGHT.

282
00:16:37,648 --> 00:16:40,038
I'M HUMILIATED.

283
00:16:40,038 --> 00:16:42,399
I'M DISGRACED.

284
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:45,088
I'M GOING TO
KILL MYSELF.

285
00:16:45,188 --> 00:16:48,467
I STILL THINK
THAT THIGH THING
WOULD HAVE BEEN CHARMING.

286
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:58,031
CHEERS.

287
00:16:58,031 --> 00:17:02,305
OH, HI, MRS. PETERSON.
YEAH, JUST A MINUTE.

288
00:17:03,841 --> 00:17:06,340
HELLO. HI, VER.

289
00:17:07,511 --> 00:17:11,222
WHOA, THAT'S GREAT NEWS.

290
00:17:11,222 --> 00:17:12,916
CLIFFIE, SHE WANTS
TO TALK TO YOU.

291
00:17:13,016 --> 00:17:16,344
ME?
SO WHAT'S
THE GOOD NEWS?

292
00:17:16,344 --> 00:17:18,854
THAT SHE WANTS
TO TALK TO YOU.

293
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:22,070
YEAH, VERA.

294
00:17:24,095 --> 00:17:27,537
WELL, YOU FOLLOWED
THE RECIPE EXACTLY?

295
00:17:27,537 --> 00:17:32,709
NO, IT'S SUPPOSED
TO BE TWO CUPS OF WATER,
NOT VINEGAR.

296
00:17:33,671 --> 00:17:38,455
GET A HOLD OF YOURSELF.
YOU'RE MAKING A CAKE,
NOT BUILDING A BOMB.

297
00:17:38,455 --> 00:17:41,722
HE OBVIOUSLY
HASN'T HAD
HER TUNA CASSEROLE.

298
00:17:57,861 --> 00:17:59,697
STUPID.

299
00:18:01,399 --> 00:18:04,412
HEY, WOODY.
WHERE'S REBECCA?

300
00:18:04,412 --> 00:18:08,152
SHE JUST PLAYED
THE JUKEBOX
AND WENT INTO
THE OFFICE.

301
00:18:09,673 --> 00:18:11,325
THANK YOU.

302
00:18:11,325 --> 00:18:13,427
I'LL BE RIGHT OVER.

303
00:18:13,527 --> 00:18:17,731
I'M GOING
OVER THERE, NORMIE.
SHE'S UP TO HER ARMPITS
IN BATTER.

304
00:18:17,731 --> 00:18:21,121
I'LL STAY.
I'VE ALREADY
SEEN THAT.

305
00:18:22,836 --> 00:18:27,641
DON'T BLAME ME.
I TOLD YOU TO TALK,
NOT INHALE HIS GUM.

306
00:18:27,741 --> 00:18:29,555
I COULDN'T
HELP MYSELF.

307
00:18:29,555 --> 00:18:32,610
AT LEAST YOU KNOW
HE'S NOT INTERESTED NOW.

308
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:34,747
WHO WANTED TO KNOW?

309
00:18:34,747 --> 00:18:38,018
YOU WERE MISERABLE
NOT KNOWING.
I WAS HAPPY
BEING MISERABLE.

310
00:18:38,018 --> 00:18:39,812
NOW YOU'VE
RUINED IT.

311
00:18:39,812 --> 00:18:44,429
LISTEN.
COME ON, SIT DOWN.
WILL YOU RELAX, PLEASE?
JUST--

312
00:18:44,429 --> 00:18:46,390
COULD I HAVE THIS?

313
00:18:51,099 --> 00:18:53,317
I'LL PROBABLY
LOSE MY JOB.

314
00:18:53,317 --> 00:18:57,233
HE'S COMING TO
FIRE YOU BECAUSE
OF ONE KISS.

315
00:18:57,233 --> 00:18:59,609
TALK ABOUT PARANOID.

316
00:19:00,374 --> 00:19:02,485
MR. DRAKE'S HERE
TO SEE YOU.

317
00:19:02,485 --> 00:19:04,831
TALK ABOUT COINCIDENCE.

318
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:09,216
I'M DEAD.
NO, YOU'RE NOT.
I'LL HANDLE THIS.

319
00:19:09,316 --> 00:19:12,745
WOODY, CAN YOU
STALL MOMENTARILY?
SURE.

320
00:19:12,745 --> 00:19:16,557
IN HIGH SCHOOL,
I ENTERED THE 4-H CLUB--

321
00:19:16,557 --> 00:19:19,820
NOT US, WOODY.
HIM. HIM!
NOT US, HIM.

322
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:23,363
OUT THERE, BOY.
SURE, SAM.

323
00:19:23,364 --> 00:19:27,009
WOULD IT HAVE
KILLED YOU
TO BE MORE SPECIFIC?

324
00:19:28,924 --> 00:19:32,139
WHAT WILL I DO?
WELL, UH...

325
00:19:32,139 --> 00:19:37,268
I'LL TELL HIM
YOU WERE BOMBED,
AND THAT IT DIDN'T
MEAN ANYTHING.

326
00:19:37,268 --> 00:19:38,879
WONDERFUL IMAGE.

327
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:41,515
A GIRL
GETS HAMMERED,
THEN TURNS
PROMISCUOUS.

328
00:19:41,615 --> 00:19:44,852
ALL RIGHT, UH...

329
00:19:44,952 --> 00:19:49,318
I'LL SAY
YOU WERE TRYING
TO MAKE ME JEALOUS
BECAUSE YOU'RE
IN LOVE WITH ME.

330
00:19:53,226 --> 00:19:56,117
LET ME SEE.
MY CHOICES ARE--

331
00:19:56,117 --> 00:20:01,171
I'M A BOOZY SLUT
OR A COMPLETE IDIOT.

332
00:20:03,170 --> 00:20:04,805
I'D GO WITH THE IDIOT.

333
00:20:04,905 --> 00:20:07,380
I ALREADY DID.

334
00:20:09,409 --> 00:20:12,447
SO, THAT'S HOW
WE KNEW,
BEYOND A DOUBT,

335
00:20:12,447 --> 00:20:17,432
WE WERE PUTTING
WAY TOO MUCH BRAN
IN THE PIG'S FODDER.

336
00:20:23,791 --> 00:20:26,759
HI, EVAN.
WHAT ARE
YOU DOING HERE?

337
00:20:26,759 --> 00:20:30,982
I THOUGHT I'D
CLEAR THIS MATTER UP
BEFORE I LEFT.

338
00:20:30,982 --> 00:20:34,924
LISTEN, THAT THING
AT THE PARTY
WAS MY FAULT.

339
00:20:34,924 --> 00:20:38,305
WE'D BEEN FIGHTING,
AND SHE WANTED
TO MAKE ME JEALOUS.

340
00:20:38,405 --> 00:20:41,475
I FIGURED IT WAS
LIKE THAT.

341
00:20:41,575 --> 00:20:43,908
I BETTER
APOLOGIZE TO HER.

342
00:20:43,908 --> 00:20:47,006
WAIT.
YOU'RE GOING
TO APOLOGIZE?

343
00:20:47,006 --> 00:20:50,661
YEAH, I WAS
A LITTLE ROUGH
ON HER.

344
00:20:51,719 --> 00:20:55,088
ACTUALLY, GIVE ME
A SECOND HERE,
WILL YOU?

345
00:20:55,088 --> 00:20:58,613
SHE PROBABLY
NEEDS TO FRESHEN UP.
SHE'S PRETTY UPSET.

346
00:20:58,613 --> 00:21:02,071
HER MASCARA'S PROBABLY
DOWN IN HER SHOES NOW.

347
00:21:02,563 --> 00:21:05,144
HOW MUCH DO
I OWE YOU FOR THAT?

348
00:21:05,144 --> 00:21:09,079
NO CHARGE.
AFTER ALL,
YOU KIND OF
OWN THE PLACE.

349
00:21:09,079 --> 00:21:13,077
OH, NO,
I'LL PAY FOR IT.
CREDIT CARD OK?

350
00:21:13,077 --> 00:21:17,836
SURE.
CAN I SEE YOUR
DRIVER'S LICENSE?

351
00:21:21,862 --> 00:21:26,000
I GAVE HIM
THE JEALOUSY STORY.
HE DIDN'T BUY IT.

352
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,360
HE IS
REALLY STEAMED.
DAMN.

353
00:21:32,026 --> 00:21:35,624
HE SAID THAT IF
YOU REALLY
LOVED ME,

354
00:21:35,624 --> 00:21:36,964
HE MIGHT
UNDERSTAND.

355
00:21:37,064 --> 00:21:38,868
IT WOULD EXPLAIN
EVERYTHING.

356
00:21:38,868 --> 00:21:40,900
BUT HE JUST
DIDN'T BUY THAT.

357
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:44,501
WHAT CAN I DO?
I DON'T KNOW.

358
00:21:44,501 --> 00:21:46,173
UNLESS...

359
00:21:46,273 --> 00:21:47,775
UNLESS WHAT?

360
00:21:47,875 --> 00:21:50,137
NO, NO,
THAT WOULDN'T WORK.

361
00:21:50,137 --> 00:21:53,480
TELL ME, PLEASE!
WELL, ALL RIGHT.

362
00:21:53,581 --> 00:21:58,797
IF HE SAW
YOU KISSING ME
MORE PASSIONATELY
THAN YOU KISSED HIM--

363
00:21:58,797 --> 00:22:00,941
FORGET IT,
FORGET IT.

364
00:22:00,941 --> 00:22:03,894
YOU NEVER GIVE UP.
YOU ARE ALWAYS
ON THE MAKE.

365
00:22:03,894 --> 00:22:05,666
LET ME TELL
YOU SOMETHING.

366
00:22:05,666 --> 00:22:09,300
I HAVE A LITTLE
SELF RESPECT.

367
00:22:09,816 --> 00:22:11,116
HELLO.

368
00:22:21,475 --> 00:22:23,410
SORRY, EVAN.

369
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:25,548
I DIDN'T HEAR
YOU COME IN.

370
00:22:25,548 --> 00:22:29,616
WE YOUNG LOVERS
CAN'T KEEP OUR HANDS
OFF EACH OTHER.

371
00:22:32,653 --> 00:22:35,288
YOU'RE A LUCKY MAN.
YOU'RE TELLING ME.

372
00:22:35,388 --> 00:22:39,218
THIS HONEY OF MINE GIVES ME
A LOT OF GOOD LOVING.

373
00:22:40,394 --> 00:22:43,019
SURE DO, PUNKIN'.

374
00:22:44,765 --> 00:22:48,720
WELL, I JUST WANTED
TO APOLOGIZE FOR
MY REACTION EARLIER.

375
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:52,505
APOLOGIZE?
TO ME?

376
00:22:52,606 --> 00:22:56,360
YEAH, I TOLD SAM--
YOU TOLD SAM?

377
00:22:57,845 --> 00:22:59,691
GOTCHA.

378
00:23:01,349 --> 00:23:05,115
WHY DON'T WE NOT SAY
ANYTHING MORE ABOUT IT.

379
00:23:05,115 --> 00:23:08,388
GREAT IDEA.
LET ME WALK
YOU OUT.

380
00:23:08,488 --> 00:23:12,387
MALONE.
LET'S SAY NOTHING MORE
ABOUT THIS.

381
00:23:18,465 --> 00:23:20,668
SAM, GET BACK HERE.

382
00:23:20,768 --> 00:23:22,935
SOME WOMEN JUST
CAN'T GET ENOUGH.

383
00:23:23,971 --> 00:23:26,592
YOU HAVEN'T MET
MY WIFE.

384
00:23:27,641 --> 00:23:29,470
GOOD NIGHT.

385
00:23:30,844 --> 00:23:34,047
HEY, COME ON.
I'M JUST HAVING
A LITTLE FUN.

386
00:23:34,147 --> 00:23:36,024
I KNOW WHY
YOU'RE UPSET.

387
00:23:36,024 --> 00:23:38,395
YOU DISCOVERED
SOMETHING YOU
DIDN'T EXPECT.

388
00:23:38,395 --> 00:23:41,001
YOUR TRUE FEELINGS
WERE REVEALED.

389
00:23:41,001 --> 00:23:45,292
WHAT?
NO WOMAN
KISSES LIKE THAT
WITHOUT MEANING IT.

390
00:23:45,392 --> 00:23:46,824
ARE YOU NUTS?

391
00:23:46,824 --> 00:23:50,564
NO, NO, NO.
YOU CAN'T FAKE
PASSION LIKE THAT.

392
00:23:50,564 --> 00:23:52,165
OH, IS THAT RIGHT?

393
00:23:52,265 --> 00:23:53,710
HEY, FRASIER.

394
00:24:05,312 --> 00:24:07,551
NICE TRY.

395
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:14,727
FRASIER.
FRASIER.

396
00:24:14,728 --> 00:24:15,728
translate
