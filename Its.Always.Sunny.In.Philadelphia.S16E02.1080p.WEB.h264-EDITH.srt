1
00:00:06,586 --> 00:00:09,777
DENNIS:
Frank, would you like
another buttered nipple?

2
00:00:09,777 --> 00:00:13,062
No. The cream
is making me gassy.

3
00:00:13,062 --> 00:00:16,060
-Yeah, well, you have had
four of them.
-Yeah.

4
00:00:16,060 --> 00:00:19,559
-You know, we could order you
something that's a little bit
easier on the pipes.

5
00:00:19,559 --> 00:00:21,303
-You know,
I know what you're doing.

6
00:00:21,303 --> 00:00:26,717
This is your annual
"take me out and see
if you can talk me into
giving you more of my money."

7
00:00:26,717 --> 00:00:28,533
-Oh, stop.
-Uh-- Is he talking to us?

8
00:00:28,533 --> 00:00:30,909
-Give me money.
-We would never.

9
00:00:30,909 --> 00:00:33,771
-DEE: And we just want you
to have a fun night.
DENNIS:
Yeah.

10
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,869
-Yeah, get that.
-What you working on there, bud?

11
00:00:38,869 --> 00:00:41,936
I brought my own can
of anchovies

12
00:00:41,969 --> 00:00:43,243
because the fish in this place
is not salty enough.

13
00:00:43,243 --> 00:00:45,328
-Mm, that's...
-I agree.

14
00:00:45,328 --> 00:00:47,814
-Got no taste.
-Yeah, no, I-I hear you.

15
00:00:47,814 --> 00:00:49,893
It's, uh, it's not salty enough.

16
00:00:49,893 --> 00:00:52,268
I want to point something out
here to you, Frank.

17
00:00:52,268 --> 00:00:56,676
I think we do a pretty good job
of pretending like
you're not an animal.

18
00:00:56,676 --> 00:00:59,822
- Is that thing loaded,
by the way?
- Nah, it's not loaded.

19
00:00:59,822 --> 00:01:02,956
-And get off my back,
huh?

20
00:01:02,956 --> 00:01:05,357
-Yup.
-Hey. Absolutely.

21
00:01:05,357 --> 00:01:08,866
- You got it.
Got no intention to be
riding on your back, pal.

22
00:01:08,866 --> 00:01:10,533
DENNIS:
We like you
just the way you are.

23
00:01:10,533 --> 00:01:13,718
-And I think that, you know,
maybe, just possibly, 

24
00:01:13,718 --> 00:01:18,370
that
entitles us to a little taste
of your fortune after you die?
You know what I mean? I-I...
-Oh.

25
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:22,652
I want to tell you something,
I am not intending on dying
anytime soon,

26
00:01:22,652 --> 00:01:25,265
so don't waste your breath.

27
00:01:26,414 --> 00:01:27,813
-You know what? Screw this.

28
00:01:27,813 --> 00:01:29,917
-I... Dee, I told you
this was a mistake.
-No, I know, I know.

29
00:01:29,917 --> 00:01:33,227
-I-- You know what? I'm out
-of here.
-Couple of vultures
picking at my carcass.

30
00:01:33,227 --> 00:01:35,925
-You know, I am in the prime
of my life.

31
00:01:35,925 --> 00:01:38,938
I mean, if you think
that you can...

32
00:01:40,179 --> 00:01:42,950
-DENNIS: You shot us! You shot us!
- I got shot in the face!

33
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:44,667
You said there were no bullets!

34
00:01:44,667 --> 00:01:47,510
Okay, so it was loaded.
My mistake.

35
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:50,476
Oh, don't be so dramatic.
I just nicked you.

36
00:01:50,476 --> 00:01:54,217
It's not like anybody's
in any real danger.

37
00:02:17,067 --> 00:02:20,474
I'm saying, don't shoot
the whole balloon down, right?
Like, you-you pull it down...

38
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:23,681
-Frank shot us.
- He shot us in the face.
We barely survived.

39
00:02:23,681 --> 00:02:26,756
Awesome.
-Uh, no, not awesome.

40
00:02:26,756 --> 00:02:29,929
Oh, sorry.
You came in all excited.
I thought you were bragging.

41
00:02:29,991 --> 00:02:31,695
I was picking up
on an excited energy, for sure.

42
00:02:31,695 --> 00:02:34,450
- Getting shot in the face
and surviving is pretty cool.
- Yeah.

43
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:37,859
This is insane.
Listen, we got to get his gun
away from him, okay?

44
00:02:37,943 --> 00:02:39,108
I-I don't even care
about the money anymore.

45
00:02:39,108 --> 00:02:41,493
Oh, yeah, no, no, neither do I.
I don't give a shit
about the money.

46
00:02:41,493 --> 00:02:44,592
I mean, the man is a maniac,

47
00:02:44,625 --> 00:02:44,840
and he's gonna wind up shooting
everyone in this bar.

48
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:48,336
Oh, yeah. I do care
about the money, though.
-Yeah, no, so do I. Absolutely.

49
00:02:48,336 --> 00:02:49,833
-It's the only thing I care
about. Are you kidding me?

50
00:02:49,833 --> 00:02:52,516
Come on. You know
what I'm worried about?
I'm worried he's gonna
kill himself with that gun

51
00:02:52,516 --> 00:02:55,125
before he gets
old and senile enough
to rewrite us into the will.

52
00:02:55,125 --> 00:02:58,670
That's it. That's it.
We need him to live
long enough
so he can become fully demented.

53
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:02,130
-CHARLIE: I know, but, guys,
I'm picking up, like,
a super stressed-out vibe
from you,

54
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:06,697
and it's really important
to remember, like,
you know,
money isn't everything.

55
00:03:06,781 --> 00:03:11,129
Yeah, of course
you don't care, Charlie,
because your dad didn't have
anything to pass down to you.

56
00:03:11,129 --> 00:03:13,883
No, that's true,
but my mom does. Yeah.

57
00:03:13,908 --> 00:03:17,120
On my mom's family side, I got a
huge inheritance coming my way.

58
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,515
Wait, what?
H-How did I not know this?

59
00:03:20,515 --> 00:03:23,096
- You're gonna be rich?
- Yeah. Totally. Yeah.

60
00:03:23,174 --> 00:03:27,631
Well, uh,
rich in history and legacy
and, uh...

61
00:03:27,631 --> 00:03:29,162
...teeth, of course.

62
00:03:29,162 --> 00:03:32,896
- Teeth?
- Yeah. It's a pretty sweet deal,
actually, you know.

63
00:03:32,896 --> 00:03:35,042
Everyone on my mom's side
of the family,

64
00:03:35,042 --> 00:03:39,387
going back to the Niña
and the-the Pinta
and the, uh, Santa Margherita,

65
00:03:39,393 --> 00:03:42,813
um, they've all been putting
their teeth into a jar
when they die.

66
00:03:42,813 --> 00:03:48,209
And, uh, when I turn 40,
that sweet little piece
of history's coming my way.

67
00:03:48,209 --> 00:03:50,893
Just stop. Okay, Dee,
we need to get that gun
away from Frank.

68
00:03:50,893 --> 00:03:53,980
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh.
You don't do something
like that.

69
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:57,062
You know, because, like,
Frank's gun is a big piece
of who he is, right?

70
00:03:57,062 --> 00:04:01,644
That's his legacy.
That's his history.
That's like, that's like
my jar of teeth, right?

71
00:04:01,644 --> 00:04:05,160
- I don't want that taken away
from me when I get old.
- What are you talking about?

72
00:04:05,235 --> 00:04:08,157
Charlie, I got some
bad news for you, bud.

73
00:04:08,205 --> 00:04:12,067
- What?
- You turned 40 a long time ago.

74
00:04:14,021 --> 00:04:16,848
Yo. Hey, Ma, how you doing?
-Hi, Mom.

75
00:04:16,848 --> 00:04:19,362
-Oh, hi, boys.
What brings you by?

76
00:04:19,362 --> 00:04:23,175
-Yeah, uh,
hey, I want to show Mac
that jar of family teeth we got.

77
00:04:23,175 --> 00:04:27,504
-Y-You-you do?
-CHARLIE: Yeah.
Hey, Ma, did you realize
I was over 40?

78
00:04:27,504 --> 00:04:29,682
- You are?
- Yeah, turns out. 

79
00:04:29,739 --> 00:04:33,602
Yeah, I figured
you probably forgot, too,
or something, but, um, yeah,
can I get that jar of teeth
now, please?

80
00:04:33,602 --> 00:04:35,715
Oh, okay, I-I'll go
look for them.

81
00:04:35,715 --> 00:04:38,425
Okay, yeah, good.
Go-go get my teeth, please.

82
00:04:38,425 --> 00:04:40,165
Cool. Hey, Mom,
since we're here, um,

83
00:04:40,165 --> 00:04:43,248
do we have any kind of, like,
family heirlooms or anything?

84
00:04:43,305 --> 00:04:44,770
No.

85
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:48,968
Like, anything of value
that our family owned
at some point?

86
00:04:48,968 --> 00:04:50,453
No.

87
00:04:50,453 --> 00:04:54,833
Hm. Okay, what if it's just,
like, sentimental?
Just, like,
proof that we existed?

88
00:04:54,833 --> 00:04:56,125
Nope.

89
00:04:56,125 --> 00:04:58,637
Wait, what about those letters?
Weren't there
some kind of letters

90
00:04:58,637 --> 00:05:01,982
that my grandfather
wrote to my dad
during World War II?

91
00:05:01,982 --> 00:05:03,573
Yeah.

92
00:05:03,573 --> 00:05:07,330
- Those letters exist?
Well, well, who's got them?
- Donald.

93
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:10,335
-Donald? Donald who?
-Oh...

94
00:05:10,335 --> 00:05:12,542
Duck.

95
00:05:13,743 --> 00:05:16,042
Donald... Donald Duck?
What's she talking about?

96
00:05:16,042 --> 00:05:18,482
Yeah, my mom's making a joke.
She's-she's really funny.

97
00:05:18,482 --> 00:05:20,306
She's got a great sense
of humor. Right, Mom?

98
00:05:20,306 --> 00:05:21,455
Yeah.

99
00:05:21,455 --> 00:05:23,495
Yeah. She's talking
about my Uncle Donald.

100
00:05:23,495 --> 00:05:26,725
- Huh. I didn't even know
you had an uncle Donald.
- Yeah, yeah,
that's my dad's brother.

101
00:05:26,725 --> 00:05:29,556
- Donald McDonald?
- Yeah.

102
00:05:29,556 --> 00:05:32,838
Ronald McDonald.
Donald McDonald. 

103
00:05:32,838 --> 00:05:36,910
Wow. Your dad really scored with
the name Luther, I guess, huh?

104
00:05:37,255 --> 00:05:39,698
Mom? What happened?

105
00:05:39,698 --> 00:05:42,848
-MAC: Oh, shit.
Did she try to pull out
her own teeth?

106
00:05:42,848 --> 00:05:44,499
Did you just try to pull out
your own teeth?

107
00:05:44,561 --> 00:05:48,724
-She clearly did. I can see the pliers.
-We can see the pliers, Mom.

108
00:05:50,105 --> 00:05:52,502
-I'm so sorry.

109
00:05:52,502 --> 00:05:55,305
-CHARLIE: Mom.
Oh, my God. Why did you do that?

110
00:05:55,305 --> 00:05:58,112
I didn't have the heart
to-to tell you,

111
00:05:58,165 --> 00:06:01,112
I gave away the jar.

112
00:06:01,178 --> 00:06:04,949
- You gave away the jar of teeth?
To who?
- Your sisters.

113
00:06:04,949 --> 00:06:09,060
To my sisters?
Those ungrateful bitches.
What the hell, Mom?

114
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:12,660
They don't even live
in Philly anymore.
They moved all the way
up to northern New Jersey.

115
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:15,563
They're terrible to you.
I'm the one who stayed. I'm
the one who takes care of you.

116
00:06:15,618 --> 00:06:17,676
How could you do that?

117
00:06:19,694 --> 00:06:22,566
Now she's screaming.
Now she's screaming.
-Well, you yelled at her.

118
00:06:22,566 --> 00:06:25,488
-Now Mom's screaming.
Now Mom's screaming.

119
00:06:25,575 --> 00:06:27,005
Ah, I can't believe
you did this.

120
00:06:27,005 --> 00:06:30,667
-Why are you yelling at her?
I don't know...
-She gave it away to my sisters.
They're the worst people
on the planet.

121
00:06:30,667 --> 00:06:32,415
I didn't even remember
that you had sisters.

122
00:06:32,415 --> 00:06:35,285
All right. Okay, okay.
Look, we're just gonna have
to go and get them.

123
00:06:35,285 --> 00:06:36,725
I think she's having
a stroke, dude.

124
00:06:36,725 --> 00:06:38,977
We're just gonna have
to get in the car right now
and go get them. Come on, man.

125
00:06:38,977 --> 00:06:42,158
-We should go to the hospital.
- Let's get in the car. Let's go.
Mrs. Mac, we're taking your car.

126
00:06:42,158 --> 00:06:45,205
Mom, just calm down.
It's okay, okay? I'm not mad
at you. It's fine, okay?

127
00:06:45,205 --> 00:06:46,730
-I love you.
-Breathe through your,
breathe through your nose.

128
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:48,540
-I love you, too.
I love you, too.
-This is fucking insane.

129
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:50,445
I made a mistake.

130
00:06:50,445 --> 00:06:52,259
You did make a mistake.
You did make this...

131
00:06:52,259 --> 00:06:56,106
Christ, let's get her
cleaned up. All right.
I didn't mean to upset you.

132
00:06:57,947 --> 00:07:01,753
Frank, um,
could you stop scratching
yourself with the gun, please?

133
00:07:01,753 --> 00:07:04,452
-I'm itchy, I'm itchy.
-I-I bet.

134
00:07:04,485 --> 00:07:05,753
Probably from rolling around
in the grass

135
00:07:05,786 --> 00:07:06,987
outside of your apartment.

136
00:07:07,021 --> 00:07:08,589
No, I was rolling around
in the grass

137
00:07:08,622 --> 00:07:09,723
because I was itchy.

138
00:07:09,757 --> 00:07:10,991
The itch came first.

139
00:07:11,025 --> 00:07:12,660
Okay, well, why don't you
hand me the gun,

140
00:07:12,693 --> 00:07:13,727
-and I'll scratch you
with my fingers.
-Yeah.

141
00:07:13,761 --> 00:07:15,396
I'm not gonna hand you my gun,

142
00:07:15,429 --> 00:07:16,597
but I'll let you scratch.
You want to scratch me?

143
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:19,066
-Go on. Yeah.
-Okay.

144
00:07:19,099 --> 00:07:20,768
-All right.
-Scratch me. See.

145
00:07:20,801 --> 00:07:22,870
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Do it down by the neck.

146
00:07:22,903 --> 00:07:24,672
-Frank, I...
-FRANK: The back of the neck.
The back of the neck.

147
00:07:24,705 --> 00:07:25,606
-Okay, but I just don't want
to get shot again, is all.

148
00:07:25,639 --> 00:07:27,007
The gun's not loaded.

149
00:07:27,041 --> 00:07:28,609
Yeah, that's what you said
last time, Frank.

150
00:07:28,642 --> 00:07:30,511
FRANK:
I got to take a piss.

151
00:07:30,544 --> 00:07:31,846
-Pull over.
-DENNIS: All right.

152
00:07:38,385 --> 00:07:39,453
Okay.

153
00:07:39,487 --> 00:07:40,988
-Goddamn it.

154
00:07:41,021 --> 00:07:42,590
This is not working.

155
00:07:42,623 --> 00:07:44,024
Should we just attack him
and take it?

156
00:07:44,058 --> 00:07:45,993
What? No.

157
00:07:46,026 --> 00:07:47,761
He'd mow us down like Scarface.
We can't come at him like that.

158
00:07:47,795 --> 00:07:49,864
-We'll spook him.
-Yeah.

159
00:07:49,897 --> 00:07:51,398
You know what?
He needs to be lulled

160
00:07:51,432 --> 00:07:52,933
into a false sense of security.

161
00:07:52,967 --> 00:07:54,768
You don't tell a dog
you're taking him to a vet

162
00:07:54,802 --> 00:07:55,870
to put him down.

163
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:57,438
Right.

164
00:07:58,205 --> 00:08:01,075
You give
that dog
the best day of his life,

165
00:08:01,108 --> 00:08:03,777
and then you turn out the lights
when he least suspects it.

166
00:08:03,811 --> 00:08:05,946
-Okay.

167
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:07,548
Okay. Oh...

168
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:11,986
Ooh, that was a long wait.

169
00:08:12,019 --> 00:08:13,954
-Woo.
-Wow.

170
00:08:19,794 --> 00:08:21,328
♪ Just can't wait... ♪

171
00:08:21,362 --> 00:08:22,863
Why is your mom driving
my mom's car?

172
00:08:22,897 --> 00:08:24,465
I don't know. Dude, they got
some weird arrangement

173
00:08:24,498 --> 00:08:26,734
worked out so your mom
can focus on smoking.

174
00:08:26,767 --> 00:08:28,636
Speaking of, I'm getting
choked to death back here.

175
00:08:28,669 --> 00:08:30,771
Mrs. Mac, do you mind, like,
cracking a window or something?

176
00:08:30,805 --> 00:08:32,506
No.

177
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:34,375
Why not? I mean, it's ridiculous
to just sit in the smoke.

178
00:08:34,408 --> 00:08:37,912
'Cause it's too drafty.
It's unhealthy.

179
00:08:37,945 --> 00:08:39,613
-Right.
-Unheal-- What?

180
00:08:39,647 --> 00:08:41,382
Sorry, my mom's on
a new health kick.

181
00:08:41,415 --> 00:08:43,350
Hey, Mom, it's working.
You look great.

182
00:08:43,384 --> 00:08:44,852
Shut up.

183
00:08:44,885 --> 00:08:46,654
CHARLIE:
Can we, like speed up
or something?

184
00:08:46,687 --> 00:08:48,722
Another car just passed us.
Mom, that's, like, the 50th car.

185
00:08:48,756 --> 00:08:50,024
Why are you going so slow?

186
00:08:50,057 --> 00:08:51,859
Well, highways are scary.

187
00:08:51,892 --> 00:08:53,594
You're going 35.

188
00:08:53,627 --> 00:08:54,628
-I can see you're going 35.
-But-- And everybody's

189
00:08:54,662 --> 00:08:55,763
just in such a hurry.

190
00:08:55,796 --> 00:08:57,465
No, it's just the normal--

191
00:08:57,498 --> 00:08:59,033
It's the speed that people go
on the highway.

192
00:08:59,066 --> 00:09:00,601
Okay, maybe I should drive.
Mom, can I drive your car?

193
00:09:00,634 --> 00:09:01,936
-Can Mac drive?
-No.

194
00:09:01,969 --> 00:09:04,605
Ugh, this is my worst
nightmare, man.

195
00:09:04,638 --> 00:09:06,373
This is absolutely terrible.
How much further?

196
00:09:06,407 --> 00:09:07,875
Anyone know? Mac?

197
00:09:07,908 --> 00:09:09,910
How much further? Mac?

198
00:09:09,944 --> 00:09:11,779
Mac? Hello?

199
00:09:11,812 --> 00:09:15,082
My mom's finger
is up, which means "no talking".

200
00:09:15,115 --> 00:09:16,784
She's annoyed. It's best if we

201
00:09:16,817 --> 00:09:18,986
just keep it down
until the finger goes down,

202
00:09:19,019 --> 00:09:21,489
otherwise, she might burn us
with the cigarette lighter.

203
00:09:21,522 --> 00:09:23,657
This is my worst nightmare

204
00:09:23,691 --> 00:09:24,959
in my entire life.

205
00:09:25,893 --> 00:09:27,995
Okay, finger's down. Um, great.

206
00:09:28,028 --> 00:09:29,864
Uh, okay, Mrs. Kelly,
you're gonna want to stay

207
00:09:29,897 --> 00:09:32,366
on the Jersey Turnpike
until you hit 287.

208
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:34,502
You want to take 287
towards Hamburg.

209
00:09:34,535 --> 00:09:36,504
Mm, no. That--
No, you just stay on the 206

210
00:09:36,537 --> 00:09:37,505
the whole way up.

211
00:09:37,538 --> 00:09:38,806
No, no, we're gonna,

212
00:09:38,839 --> 00:09:39,907
we're gonna hit Hamburg
on the way.

213
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:41,041
Why are we going to Hamburg?

214
00:09:41,075 --> 00:09:42,743
We're gonna visit
my Uncle Donald.

215
00:09:42,776 --> 00:09:45,546
-Donald McDonald
of Hamburger, New Jersey?
-Hamburg.

216
00:09:45,579 --> 00:09:47,515
A bunch of old letters that
weren't even written to you?

217
00:09:47,548 --> 00:09:49,049
That's not a legacy, it's
a bunch of meaningless shit.

218
00:09:49,083 --> 00:09:52,052
Not as meaningless as a jar
full of teeth.

219
00:09:52,086 --> 00:09:53,521
-CHARLIE: Ah! She got you.
She got you.
-Sorry, Mom, sorry, Mom.

220
00:09:53,554 --> 00:09:54,922
Sorry, Mom.
I didn't see the finger.

221
00:09:54,955 --> 00:09:56,791
No, her hand was not
in the air that time.

222
00:09:56,824 --> 00:09:58,359
-She burnt the shit out of me.
-You didn't even put your hand--

223
00:09:58,392 --> 00:10:00,394
-Oh, it's up now, it's up now.
-Yeah.

224
00:10:00,427 --> 00:10:02,463
DENNIS:
Frank, we got a little
surprise for you, bud.

225
00:10:02,496 --> 00:10:03,764
What's that?

226
00:10:03,798 --> 00:10:05,633
Hamburgers.

227
00:10:05,666 --> 00:10:07,635
-Oh, hamburgers?

228
00:10:07,668 --> 00:10:09,603
Oh, that's one
of the best food there is.

229
00:10:09,637 --> 00:10:11,772
Yeah, yes, they really are.

230
00:10:11,806 --> 00:10:13,874
And, you know what, you can eat
them right here in the car.

231
00:10:13,908 --> 00:10:16,610
You know, once in a while,
they give me the runs.

232
00:10:16,644 --> 00:10:18,913
Yeah, that's why we put
that towel down for you, buddy.

233
00:10:18,946 --> 00:10:21,081
Mmm. Mmm!

234
00:10:21,115 --> 00:10:22,917
-Okay. All right.

235
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:24,318
-Mmm.
-You want to take it easy?

236
00:10:24,351 --> 00:10:25,653
Goddamn. Just one bite
at a time,

237
00:10:25,686 --> 00:10:26,887
or you're gonna barf everywhere.

238
00:10:26,921 --> 00:10:29,023
-Mmm.
-Yeah, it's good, huh?

239
00:10:29,056 --> 00:10:30,991
Yeah, really hammering them
down there, huh, bud?

240
00:10:31,025 --> 00:10:32,326
Very good. Mmm.

241
00:10:36,564 --> 00:10:37,998
I almost ate my gun.

242
00:10:39,066 --> 00:10:40,067
I dipped it in the ketchup.

243
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:41,335
Thought it was a french fry.

244
00:10:41,368 --> 00:10:42,336
Yeah, that is funny.

245
00:10:42,369 --> 00:10:43,337
Wow.

246
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:44,472
Hey, you know what?

247
00:10:44,505 --> 00:10:45,473
I'm-I'm gonna pull over, Frank.

248
00:10:45,506 --> 00:10:47,508
I got to take a piss anyway.

249
00:10:47,541 --> 00:10:48,976
Again. Okay.

250
00:10:50,845 --> 00:10:53,514
-DENNIS: Well, Frank...
-FRANK: What?

251
00:10:53,547 --> 00:10:54,648
DENNIS:
Look where we are.

252
00:10:54,682 --> 00:10:56,050
We're at the bridge.

253
00:10:56,083 --> 00:10:58,352
Oh, I haven't been here
in forever.

254
00:10:58,385 --> 00:10:59,987
-Go check it out-- Oh!
-Oh!
-Oh.

255
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:02,590
-Ooh.
-Did-did you just slam your head
into the window?

256
00:11:02,623 --> 00:11:04,592
Yeah, I didn't realize
it was up.

257
00:11:04,625 --> 00:11:06,460
Well, were you gonna
dive out of it?

258
00:11:06,494 --> 00:11:08,496
Yeah, I was very excited.
I want to go.

259
00:11:08,529 --> 00:11:09,997
-All right.
-Go see the boys.

260
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:11,332
-Have fun, buddy.
-Go see the boys.

261
00:11:11,365 --> 00:11:13,334
-Get after it.
-Okay.

262
00:11:13,367 --> 00:11:15,870
-FRANK: Okay.
-I don't know how much
more of this I can take.

263
00:11:15,903 --> 00:11:18,038
Hey, we're almost there, Dee,
okay? He's getting tired.

264
00:11:18,072 --> 00:11:19,874
Let's let run him around
the bridge for a little while,

265
00:11:19,907 --> 00:11:21,842
-and then we have
one more stop, okay?
-Uh...

266
00:11:25,412 --> 00:11:27,815
Oh, he's pissing
on another hydrant.

267
00:11:27,848 --> 00:11:29,517
Okay. He's...

268
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:31,886
literally turning into a dog.

269
00:11:31,919 --> 00:11:32,953
Yeah.

270
00:11:35,089 --> 00:11:37,491
I got to smash.

271
00:11:37,525 --> 00:11:39,627
You just smashed. You smashed,
like, three times

272
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:41,462
on the way up here.
We keep having to pull over

273
00:11:41,495 --> 00:11:43,063
-so you can smash. What...
-There is a lot of smashing.

274
00:11:43,097 --> 00:11:44,598
She's very regular.

275
00:11:44,632 --> 00:11:46,367
Oh, no, I'm out of paper towels.

276
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,469
Oh, I wouldn't worry
about that, Mrs. Kelly.

277
00:11:48,502 --> 00:11:50,504
I'm sure my Uncle Donald
has toilet paper.

278
00:11:50,538 --> 00:11:51,639
You've been wiping
with paper towels?

279
00:11:51,672 --> 00:11:54,074
I hope everyone

280
00:11:54,108 --> 00:11:55,943
brought their appetite

281
00:11:55,976 --> 00:11:58,512
because I made quiche.

282
00:11:59,914 --> 00:12:01,882
Aw, that's really nice,
Uncle Donald,

283
00:12:01,916 --> 00:12:03,350
but we're kind of in a hurry.

284
00:12:03,384 --> 00:12:05,719
W-Well, that's a shame.

285
00:12:05,753 --> 00:12:07,388
We never get to see each other.

286
00:12:07,421 --> 00:12:09,657
Yeah, that is a shame,

287
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:12,626
but I'm really here
about the letters.

288
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:14,728
You know, the letters that

289
00:12:14,762 --> 00:12:16,530
Grandpop wrote to you and Dad
during the war.

290
00:12:16,564 --> 00:12:19,900
Oh. Oh, yes, yes,
I-I-I have those letters.

291
00:12:19,934 --> 00:12:21,602
Oh, that's great.

292
00:12:21,635 --> 00:12:23,471
I was kind of hoping
they would pass down to me.

293
00:12:23,504 --> 00:12:25,473
You know, sort of like
a family heirloom.

294
00:12:25,506 --> 00:12:27,808
Well, that would make sense
because, well,

295
00:12:27,842 --> 00:12:29,877
they weren't actually
written to me.

296
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:33,013
They were addressed
only, uh, to your dad.

297
00:12:33,047 --> 00:12:35,783
Grandpop didn't write to you?

298
00:12:35,816 --> 00:12:38,519
He-he liked your dad,
uh... more.

299
00:12:38,552 --> 00:12:40,354
Uh, you know, I was the, um,

300
00:12:40,387 --> 00:12:41,889
you know, "funny" one, you know.

301
00:12:41,922 --> 00:12:44,058
It's the reason
I never got married.

302
00:12:44,091 --> 00:12:46,727
Not something we talked about
back then, but...

303
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:49,363
but i-it always made me feel,

304
00:12:49,396 --> 00:12:52,032
uh, a little, uh...

305
00:12:52,066 --> 00:12:54,401
different.

306
00:12:54,435 --> 00:12:56,036
Well, I-I'm sure
you can understand

307
00:12:56,070 --> 00:12:57,438
what that feels like, Ronald.

308
00:12:59,807 --> 00:13:00,941
No.

309
00:13:00,975 --> 00:13:03,043
So, the letters?

310
00:13:03,077 --> 00:13:05,513
-Oh, yes.
-Yeah?

311
00:13:05,546 --> 00:13:07,515
-CHARLIE: Oh!
- Sure.

312
00:13:07,548 --> 00:13:09,383
Okay.

313
00:13:09,416 --> 00:13:11,585
Yeah, this is, uh,
this is great, Uncle Donald,

314
00:13:11,619 --> 00:13:12,853
'cause it's really gonna tie

315
00:13:12,887 --> 00:13:14,655
a lot of things together
for me, you know?

316
00:13:14,688 --> 00:13:16,657
It's, uh-- I have something
to pass down to my kids.

317
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:18,392
It's-it's important
to have a legacy.

318
00:13:18,425 --> 00:13:19,860
Oh, yes. You know, I...

319
00:13:19,894 --> 00:13:21,996
I wouldn't know, though.
I, you know, I...

320
00:13:22,029 --> 00:13:24,031
I don't have
any children of my own.

321
00:13:24,064 --> 00:13:26,066
Oh, yeah.

322
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:27,868
-What is
this guy's deal?
-DONALD: Oh, here they are.

323
00:13:27,902 --> 00:13:29,904
It's, like,
everything you've ever wanted.

324
00:13:29,937 --> 00:13:32,773
Kind of sad, really, uh,
me keeping letters

325
00:13:32,807 --> 00:13:35,342
that, uh, weren't even for me.

326
00:13:35,376 --> 00:13:37,611
You know. But, uh...

327
00:13:37,645 --> 00:13:41,048
I guess I just, uh,
wanted a connection, uh...

328
00:13:42,917 --> 00:13:44,418
...with my dad.

329
00:13:45,686 --> 00:13:47,054
Yeah.

330
00:13:47,087 --> 00:13:50,658
That is sad.

331
00:13:50,691 --> 00:13:52,760
If I could just-- Yeah.
Thank you.

332
00:13:52,793 --> 00:13:55,329
I mean, you know,
there's nothing more...

333
00:13:55,362 --> 00:13:57,398
more important in this world
than the connection

334
00:13:57,431 --> 00:13:59,033
between a father and a son.

335
00:13:59,066 --> 00:14:01,936
Well, besides the connection
between a son and a mother.

336
00:14:01,969 --> 00:14:03,604
Right, Mom?

337
00:14:05,639 --> 00:14:07,007
She's smashing.

338
00:14:07,041 --> 00:14:09,510
-Yeah, she took off, man.
-Yeah, she had to smash.

339
00:14:09,543 --> 00:14:12,646
Well, I guess we could wait
for her in the car.

340
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:14,014
This is so annoying.

341
00:14:14,048 --> 00:14:15,883
I mean, you're gonna
take time out of my day,

342
00:14:15,916 --> 00:14:17,485
and you have everything you've
ever dreamed of right here,

343
00:14:17,518 --> 00:14:19,019
but we're gonna just blow
right past it, aren't we?

344
00:14:19,053 --> 00:14:20,588
It's probably time to go, huh?

345
00:14:20,621 --> 00:14:22,623
-Well, uh, o-okay.
-Yeah.

346
00:14:22,656 --> 00:14:24,058
Okay, well-well, uh,
you know, hey,

347
00:14:24,091 --> 00:14:26,026
if you ever want to, uh,
you know, hang out,

348
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:28,496
you know, we could throw
the old football around.

349
00:14:28,529 --> 00:14:30,364
Ah, I don't really like
playing football.

350
00:14:30,397 --> 00:14:31,765
It's kind of for jocks.

351
00:14:31,799 --> 00:14:33,501
-It's all he ever talks about...
-No, it's like...

352
00:14:33,534 --> 00:14:34,902
...is wanting to have
a catch with his dad, so...

353
00:14:34,935 --> 00:14:35,936
Nah, 'cause remember
we were talking about how

354
00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:37,404
it was like a... for jocks?

355
00:14:37,438 --> 00:14:39,373
-Uh, no. That never happened.
-Oh.

356
00:14:39,406 --> 00:14:41,008
Uh, yeah, well, uh,
we could read.

357
00:14:41,041 --> 00:14:42,743
-We could read.
-Oh, but, like, he can't read.

358
00:14:42,776 --> 00:14:44,512
-Imagine that. Imagine that.
-He can't read, so...

359
00:14:44,545 --> 00:14:45,746
Yeah, but he's not talking
about me, he's talking about

360
00:14:45,779 --> 00:14:47,348
-bonding with you.
-Yeah, like...

361
00:14:47,381 --> 00:14:48,382
But we're gonna
blow right past this, huh?

362
00:14:48,415 --> 00:14:49,617
Reading is for nerds, so...

363
00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:50,785
-Yeah, is that what it is?
-Yeah.

364
00:14:50,818 --> 00:14:52,386
-Uh, cards?
-Uh, well,

365
00:14:52,419 --> 00:14:53,988
the thing about cards
is, like, with the...

366
00:14:54,021 --> 00:14:56,891
the jacks and the queens
and the kings and, like,

367
00:14:56,924 --> 00:14:58,592
I don't like
celebrating royalty.

368
00:14:58,626 --> 00:15:00,494
-You know, he-he knows that.
-Oh, my God, dude.

369
00:15:00,528 --> 00:15:02,329
-Oh, my God, man.
-You know that.
We've talked about that.

370
00:15:02,363 --> 00:15:04,532
You're driving me crazy, dude.
All right, fine, let's go.

371
00:15:04,565 --> 00:15:06,801
-Bye-bye.
-Okay, maybe you guys
can swap phone numbers or...

372
00:15:06,834 --> 00:15:09,470
-I think that would be weird.
-No? No, not gonna do it?

373
00:15:09,503 --> 00:15:10,437
-That would be weird. Okay.
-Fine, then this was a good
waste of our time, wasn't it?

374
00:15:15,009 --> 00:15:16,977
-Well, t

375
00:15:17,011 --> 00:15:18,512
-Yep.
-Mm.

376
00:15:18,546 --> 00:15:19,480
DENNIS: Beautiful.
Probably brings back

377
00:15:19,513 --> 00:15:20,614
a lot of good memories.

378
00:15:20,648 --> 00:15:21,982
-Right, Frank?
-Absolutely.

379
00:15:22,016 --> 00:15:24,952
-Yeah.
-You guys, uh, mind if I...

380
00:15:24,985 --> 00:15:27,488
-Oh, no. Of course. No, please.
Please. Yeah.
-Please. Yeah.

381
00:15:28,889 --> 00:15:30,691
Take that you, cesspool.

382
00:15:30,724 --> 00:15:33,694
Polluted sack of shit.

383
00:15:33,727 --> 00:15:36,030
You know, Dee, I kind of feel
like we did a good thing here.

384
00:15:36,063 --> 00:15:38,666
I do, too.
We gave him a good day.

385
00:15:38,699 --> 00:15:40,434
-Mm-hmm.
-For him.

386
00:15:40,468 --> 00:15:41,902
Not for a normal person.

387
00:15:41,936 --> 00:15:43,404
-Yeah. Jesus.

388
00:15:45,339 --> 00:15:46,574
Right.

389
00:15:46,607 --> 00:15:47,708
You all done, bud?

390
00:15:47,741 --> 00:15:50,311
-Yeah. Thanks, guys.
-Yeah.

391
00:15:50,344 --> 00:15:51,912
-Good. Hey, oh, absolutely.
-Yeah.

392
00:15:51,946 --> 00:15:53,848
-You got it.
-Hey, listen,
where to now, Frank?

393
00:15:53,881 --> 00:15:55,416
-We want to take you somewhere.
-Uh, no, it's okay. I get it.

394
00:15:55,449 --> 00:15:57,384
I-I thought it was
a cash grab at first,

395
00:15:57,418 --> 00:15:58,986
but I see where you're going.

396
00:15:59,019 --> 00:16:01,822
The hamburger, playing
with Duncan under the bridge,

397
00:16:01,856 --> 00:16:03,290
and now the beach.

398
00:16:03,324 --> 00:16:04,692
A perfect day
can't last forever.

399
00:16:04,725 --> 00:16:06,494
I know why we're here.

400
00:16:06,527 --> 00:16:08,596
Oh. You do?

401
00:16:08,629 --> 00:16:09,997
Gosh.

402
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:11,565
Thanks for making it
so easy on us.

403
00:16:11,599 --> 00:16:13,400
-We expected more resistance.
-Yeah.

404
00:16:13,434 --> 00:16:15,703
Well, I guess hung on
a little bit too long.

405
00:16:15,736 --> 00:16:18,072
-A little bit.
-And afterwards,
you guys can have the money.

406
00:16:18,105 --> 00:16:19,940
-You mean it?
-Really?

407
00:16:19,974 --> 00:16:21,842
Yeah. Here.

408
00:16:21,876 --> 00:16:23,777
Oh. Gosh.

409
00:16:23,811 --> 00:16:25,980
I-I got to say, this-this went

410
00:16:26,013 --> 00:16:27,815
-so much more smoothly than I...
-Yeah, it really did.

411
00:16:27,848 --> 00:16:30,484
Uh, just do it when I'm looking
out at the ocean.

412
00:16:33,387 --> 00:16:34,522
Huh?

413
00:16:34,555 --> 00:16:37,358
Ah, don't be coy.
I had a good run.

414
00:16:37,391 --> 00:16:38,826
-What are you...
-And it's really good

415
00:16:38,859 --> 00:16:39,927
you didn't do it
in front of Charlie.

416
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,061
That was a class move.

417
00:16:41,095 --> 00:16:42,930
Just put me down quick.

418
00:16:44,632 --> 00:16:46,300
Put you down? Wha...

419
00:16:46,333 --> 00:16:47,768
Oh, you know what?
I think I'm gonna run,

420
00:16:47,802 --> 00:16:49,737
and then you do
what you have to do.

421
00:16:49,770 --> 00:16:52,339
But if you shoot me in the leg,
come over and finish me off,

422
00:16:52,373 --> 00:16:53,841
because I don't want
to lay there and suffer.

423
00:16:53,874 --> 00:16:55,409
-Actually, here,
I'm gonna take...
-What?

424
00:16:55,442 --> 00:16:56,777
What the hell are you doing?

425
00:16:56,811 --> 00:16:58,846
I'm gonna go natural,
because I've seen

426
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:01,849
too many guys die
and take a shit in their pants.

427
00:17:01,882 --> 00:17:03,617
I don't want that.
And bury my poop.

428
00:17:03,651 --> 00:17:05,519
Or just kick some sand over it.

429
00:17:05,553 --> 00:17:07,455
'Cause-- And then you can do
what you want to do.

430
00:17:07,488 --> 00:17:10,024
You can float me out into
the ocean and let sharks eat me.

431
00:17:10,057 --> 00:17:11,425
Or you can leave me
on the ground,

432
00:17:11,459 --> 00:17:12,626
gruesome for the kids to see.

433
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:14,595
Oh, ugh. Oh, my God.

434
00:17:14,628 --> 00:17:16,730
We are not gonna
kill you, Frank.

435
00:17:16,764 --> 00:17:18,732
-Huh?
-What, did you think

436
00:17:18,766 --> 00:17:20,835
we were just gonna shoot you
right here on the beach?

437
00:17:20,868 --> 00:17:22,369
I mean,
there-there's people around.

438
00:17:22,403 --> 00:17:23,971
I'm actually surprised
they didn't run

439
00:17:24,004 --> 00:17:25,873
-when you started
shooting the ocean.
-I-I'm not.

440
00:17:25,906 --> 00:17:27,975
It's the Jersey Shore.
But good God, man.

441
00:17:28,008 --> 00:17:29,543
Well, if you're not gonna
snuff me out,

442
00:17:29,577 --> 00:17:31,011
what the hell are you doing?

443
00:17:31,045 --> 00:17:32,847
We were giving you
one last day with your gun.

444
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,615
Yeah, it's time
to let it go, Frank.

445
00:17:34,648 --> 00:17:35,883
You were stealing my gun?

446
00:17:35,916 --> 00:17:36,984
-DENNIS: Well...
-Screw that.

447
00:17:37,017 --> 00:17:38,419
No, it's too dangerous, Frank.

448
00:17:38,452 --> 00:17:39,820
You're out of control
with that thing.

449
00:17:39,854 --> 00:17:41,555
By the way,
you're out of the will again.

450
00:17:41,589 --> 00:17:42,923
-What?
-Why? Just because of the gun?
-Yeah.

451
00:17:42,957 --> 00:17:45,926
Exactly. Because I don't
trust you two guys.

452
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:48,762
I mean, if you're in the will,
who knows?

453
00:17:48,796 --> 00:17:50,598
You may wind up
shooting me in the back.

454
00:17:50,631 --> 00:17:53,000
-Ah!
-You just told us
to shoot you in the back!

455
00:17:53,033 --> 00:17:54,702
That's different.
It's not the same thing.

456
00:17:54,735 --> 00:17:55,803
Take me back to Philly.

457
00:17:55,836 --> 00:17:56,971
You get an Uber.

458
00:17:57,004 --> 00:17:58,539
-DENNIS: Yeah.
-Get in the car.

459
00:17:58,572 --> 00:18:00,074
-Goddamn it.
-Go on. Let's go.
-Dee,

460
00:18:00,107 --> 00:18:01,542
-why'd you let him snatch
that thing back?
-I-I...

461
00:18:03,811 --> 00:18:05,779
All right, let's go.

462
00:18:05,813 --> 00:18:07,815
-Just barge right in, Mom.
-O-Okay.

463
00:18:07,848 --> 00:18:09,884
Don't-don't be shy, okay?

464
00:18:09,917 --> 00:18:11,719
Bunny?

465
00:18:11,752 --> 00:18:13,754
Candy?

466
00:18:13,788 --> 00:18:16,924
-Are you home?
-Which one is the can?

467
00:18:16,957 --> 00:18:18,392
There's probably, like,
a million bathrooms.

468
00:18:18,425 --> 00:18:20,361
Just go find a bathroom,
Mrs. Mac.

469
00:18:20,394 --> 00:18:22,863
-I don't remember those
being your sisters' names.

470
00:18:22,897 --> 00:18:24,865
No, it's not their names.
They had their names changed.

471
00:18:24,899 --> 00:18:27,368
Oh. How do they afford
to live like this?

472
00:18:27,401 --> 00:18:28,369
T-They're doing
some, like, stupid,

473
00:18:28,402 --> 00:18:30,004
like, social media thing.

474
00:18:30,037 --> 00:18:31,438
I-I don't know, I guess
they're making a killing on it.

475
00:18:31,472 --> 00:18:34,008
Hey! Candy, Bunny!

476
00:18:34,041 --> 00:18:35,509
-Candy...
-Oh, my God.

477
00:18:35,543 --> 00:18:36,811
BOTH:
Mom, what are you doing here?

478
00:18:36,844 --> 00:18:38,712
Well, we just wanted
to drive up...

479
00:18:38,746 --> 00:18:40,014
BOTH:
Why'd you bring Dirt Grub?

480
00:18:40,047 --> 00:18:41,315
Oh, yeah, hi.
Nice to see you, too.

481
00:18:41,348 --> 00:18:42,416
BOTH:
Shut up, fag!

482
00:18:42,449 --> 00:18:43,450
Why'd you bring your fag friend?

483
00:18:43,484 --> 00:18:44,552
Yeah, why is Mac here?

484
00:18:44,585 --> 00:18:46,821
-This is so distasteful.

485
00:18:46,854 --> 00:18:48,522
Uh, dude, uh...

486
00:18:48,556 --> 00:18:49,757
You know what? I'm not
gonna argue with you guys.

487
00:18:49,790 --> 00:18:51,292
-Oh, you're not?
-Okay? No, I'm just here

488
00:18:51,325 --> 00:18:52,593
-for the teeth.
-No, you can't have them.

489
00:18:52,626 --> 00:18:54,028
Yeah, you can't
have them, Charlie.

490
00:18:54,061 --> 00:18:55,596
-You can't have them.
-Mom gave them to us.

491
00:18:55,629 --> 00:18:57,398
Well, what do you even care
about the teeth?

492
00:18:57,431 --> 00:18:58,866
I-I thought you always said
they were weird and gross.

493
00:18:58,899 --> 00:19:00,434
-They are weird and gross.
-Yeah, super gross,

494
00:19:00,468 --> 00:19:01,702
but people like that stuff,
so we need them.

495
00:19:01,735 --> 00:19:03,437
-We need them.
-Need them for what?

496
00:19:03,471 --> 00:19:04,705
ASMR, dickweed.

497
00:19:04,738 --> 00:19:06,974
Yeah. ASMR.

498
00:19:07,007 --> 00:19:08,876
What is that? What even is that?

499
00:19:08,909 --> 00:19:11,412
We stick our hands in the jar.

500
00:19:11,445 --> 00:19:13,447
People pay to watch us
stick our hand in the jar.

501
00:19:13,481 --> 00:19:14,915
-They pay for that shit.
-Yeah.

502
00:19:14,949 --> 00:19:16,550
They like the noise
of the teeth,

503
00:19:16,584 --> 00:19:17,718
and they give us a lot
of money on OnlyFans.

504
00:19:17,751 --> 00:19:19,420
-Like, a lot of money.
-What?

505
00:19:19,453 --> 00:19:21,355
-More than you could
ever imagine.
-Yeah.

506
00:19:21,388 --> 00:19:22,990
All your doing is sticking
your hands in teeth

507
00:19:23,023 --> 00:19:24,959
and people pay you enough
to live like this?

508
00:19:24,992 --> 00:19:27,995
-We obviously take
our tops off. Like...
-Obviously.

509
00:19:28,028 --> 00:19:29,530
-Oh, girls.
-BUNNY: Oh, my God.

510
00:19:29,563 --> 00:19:31,398
-Shut up, slut.
-You're literally a slut.

511
00:19:31,432 --> 00:19:33,000
All right, you know what? Give
me the teeth. Give me the teeth.

512
00:19:33,033 --> 00:19:34,535
No. Finders keepers, bitch.

513
00:19:34,568 --> 00:19:35,870
-Finders keepers.
-You did not find them!

514
00:19:35,903 --> 00:19:37,571
-Mom gave them to you.
-Yeah, she did.

515
00:19:37,605 --> 00:19:39,673
-Okay, we're her favorite.
-I clogged the toilet.

516
00:19:39,707 --> 00:19:42,643
-What the hell? Gross.
-Who is this old lady
clogging our toilet?

517
00:19:42,676 --> 00:19:43,744
That's my mommy.

518
00:19:43,777 --> 00:19:45,379
BOTH:
Gross, Mac!

519
00:19:45,412 --> 00:19:46,614
Why did you clog our toilet?

520
00:19:46,647 --> 00:19:48,382
Why'd you clog our toilet,
old lady?

521
00:19:48,415 --> 00:19:50,317
There was no TP.

522
00:19:50,351 --> 00:19:52,853
If there was no TP,
what did you wipe with?

523
00:19:53,854 --> 00:19:54,989
The letters.

524
00:19:56,090 --> 00:19:57,992
You wiped your butt
with the letters

525
00:19:58,025 --> 00:19:59,994
that Grandpop sent Dad and then
flushed them down the toilet?

526
00:20:00,027 --> 00:20:01,762
Yeah.

527
00:20:01,796 --> 00:20:03,430
-BUNNY: Oh, my God.

528
00:20:03,464 --> 00:20:04,899
This is so weird, guys.
You got to go.

529
00:20:04,932 --> 00:20:06,500
-All right, you know what?
-No. No.

530
00:20:06,534 --> 00:20:07,902
Hey, hey. Put that down.

531
00:20:07,935 --> 00:20:09,670
This is gonna be
the new Kelly family heirloom,

532
00:20:09,703 --> 00:20:11,505
and I'm gonna put
all my teeth in it

533
00:20:11,539 --> 00:20:14,508
and all of Mom's teeth in it
and none of yours.

534
00:20:16,477 --> 00:20:17,611
Okay.

535
00:20:17,645 --> 00:20:18,846
Oh, uh, yep.

536
00:20:18,879 --> 00:20:20,714
-Yep. Yep.
-You got to stop

537
00:20:20,748 --> 00:20:22,883
doing that. You're not gonna
have any teeth left.

538
00:20:22,917 --> 00:20:24,518
You sure you don't want
to pop a couple in?

539
00:20:24,552 --> 00:20:25,553
You know, you can be
a part of my legacy, dude.

540
00:20:25,586 --> 00:20:26,554
I-I feel like you should be.

541
00:20:26,587 --> 00:20:27,988
-No, I-I'm good.
-Yeah?

542
00:20:28,022 --> 00:20:29,623
-Yeah, I'm good.
-All right, I'll tell you what.

543
00:20:29,657 --> 00:20:30,691
When one-one falls out,
go ahead and toss it in.

544
00:20:30,724 --> 00:20:32,526
-It's cool.
-It won't.

545
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:38,632
Yeah. There. Take that, lock.

546
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,969
Oh, what the hell, man?

547
00:20:42,002 --> 00:20:43,737
And the door wasn't even locked.

548
00:20:43,771 --> 00:20:44,972
You're paying
for that door, Frank.

549
00:20:45,005 --> 00:20:46,540
All right, all right.

550
00:20:46,574 --> 00:20:48,843
Well, this is great.
This is just great.

551
00:20:48,876 --> 00:20:49,977
You know, like, now
what are we supposed to all put

552
00:20:50,010 --> 00:20:51,979
-our teeth in?
-Our faces?

553
00:20:52,012 --> 00:20:53,714
-What are you talking about?
-I'm talking about our legacy.

554
00:20:53,747 --> 00:20:55,549
You know?
I can't hold onto it, man.

555
00:20:55,583 --> 00:20:57,284
Legacy? You want to talk legacy?
You know what our legacy is?

556
00:20:57,318 --> 00:20:58,619
Spending our lives
in this goddamn bar

557
00:20:58,652 --> 00:21:00,821
with a lunatic man
who acts like a dog

558
00:21:00,855 --> 00:21:02,690
and handles
his gun like a maniac!

559
00:21:02,723 --> 00:21:04,558
Oh, fine.

560
00:21:04,592 --> 00:21:07,495
I see where this
pity party's headed.

561
00:21:07,528 --> 00:21:09,563
If you're gonna be
crybabies about it,

562
00:21:09,597 --> 00:21:11,765
all right, take my gun.

563
00:21:14,435 --> 00:21:15,970
-Ow! Ow!
-Shit!

564
00:21:17,605 --> 00:21:18,873
Shit.

565
00:21:18,906 --> 00:21:20,875
Well, there you have it, Frank.

566
00:21:20,908 --> 00:21:23,344
You've officially shot
everyone in the bar.
