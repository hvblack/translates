1
00:00:06,586 --> 00:00:09,777
DENNIS:
Frank, would you like
another buttered nipple?

2
00:00:09,777 --> 00:00:13,062
No. The cream
is making me gassy.

3
00:00:13,062 --> 00:00:16,060
-Yeah, well, you have had
four of them.
-Yeah.

4
00:00:16,060 --> 00:00:19,559
-You know, we could order you
something that's a little bit
easier on the pipes.

5
00:00:19,559 --> 00:00:21,303
-You know,
I know what you're doing.

6
00:00:21,303 --> 00:00:26,717
This is your annual
"take me out and see
if you can talk me into
giving you more of my money."

7
00:00:26,717 --> 00:00:28,533
-Oh, stop.
-Uh-- Is he talking to us?

8
00:00:28,533 --> 00:00:30,909
-Give me money.
-We would never.

9
00:00:30,909 --> 00:00:33,771
-DEE: And we just want you
to have a fun night.
DENNIS:
Yeah.

10
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,869
-Yeah, get that.
-What you working on there, bud?

11
00:00:38,869 --> 00:00:41,936
I brought my own can
of anchovies

12
00:00:41,969 --> 00:00:43,243
because the fish in this place
is not salty enough.

13
00:00:43,243 --> 00:00:45,328
-Mm, that's...
-I agree.

14
00:00:45,328 --> 00:00:47,814
-Got no taste.
-Yeah, no, I-I hear you.

15
00:00:47,814 --> 00:00:49,893
It's, uh, it's not salty enough.

16
00:00:49,893 --> 00:00:52,268
I want to point something out
here to you, Frank.

17
00:00:52,268 --> 00:00:56,676
I think we do a pretty good job
of pretending like
you're not an animal.

18
00:00:56,676 --> 00:00:59,822
- Is that thing loaded,
by the way?
- Nah, it's not loaded.

19
00:00:59,822 --> 00:01:02,956
-And get off my back,
huh?

20
00:01:02,956 --> 00:01:05,357
-Yup.
-Hey. Absolutely.

21
00:01:05,357 --> 00:01:08,866
- You got it.
Got no intention to be
riding on your back, pal.

22
00:01:08,866 --> 00:01:10,533
DENNIS:
We like you
just the way you are.

23
00:01:10,533 --> 00:01:13,718
-And I think that, you know,
maybe, just possibly,

24
00:01:13,718 --> 00:01:18,370
that
entitles us to a little taste
of your fortune after you die?
You know what I mean? I-I...
-Oh.

25
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:22,652
I want to tell you something,
I am not intending on dying
anytime soon,

26
00:01:22,652 --> 00:01:25,265
so don't waste your breath.

27
00:01:26,414 --> 00:01:27,813
-You know what? Screw this.

28
00:01:27,813 --> 00:01:29,917
-I... Dee, I told you
this was a mistake.
-No, I know, I know.

29
00:01:29,917 --> 00:01:33,227
-I-- You know what? I'm out
-of here.
-Couple of vultures
picking at my carcass.

30
00:01:33,227 --> 00:01:35,925
-You know, I am in the prime
of my life.

31
00:01:35,925 --> 00:01:38,938
I mean, if you think
that you can...

32
00:01:40,179 --> 00:01:42,950
-DENNIS: You shot us! You shot us!
- I got shot in the face!

33
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:44,667
You said there were no bullets!

34
00:01:44,667 --> 00:01:47,510
Okay, so it was loaded.
My mistake.

35
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:50,476
Oh, don't be so dramatic.
I just nicked you.

36
00:01:50,476 --> 00:01:54,217
It's not like anybody's
in any real danger.

37
00:02:17,067 --> 00:02:20,474
I'm saying, don't shoot
the whole balloon down, right?
Like, you-you pull it down...

38
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:23,681
-Frank shot us.
- He shot us in the face.
We barely survived.

39
00:02:23,681 --> 00:02:26,756
Awesome.
-Uh, no, not awesome.

40
00:02:26,756 --> 00:02:29,929
Oh, sorry.
You came in all excited.
I thought you were bragging.

41
00:02:29,991 --> 00:02:31,695
I was picking up
on an excited energy, for sure.

42
00:02:31,695 --> 00:02:34,450
- Getting shot in the face
and surviving is pretty cool.
- Yeah.

43
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:37,859
This is insane.
Listen, we got to get his gun
away from him, okay?

44
00:02:37,943 --> 00:02:39,108
I-I don't even care
about the money anymore.

45
00:02:39,108 --> 00:02:41,493
Oh, yeah, no, no, neither do I.
I don't give a shit
about the money.

46
00:02:41,493 --> 00:02:44,592
I mean, the man is a maniac,

47
00:02:44,625 --> 00:02:44,840
and he's gonna wind up shooting
everyone in this bar.

48
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:48,336
Oh, yeah. I do care
about the money, though.
-Yeah, no, so do I. Absolutely.

49
00:02:48,336 --> 00:02:49,833
-It's the only thing I care
about. Are you kidding me?

50
00:02:49,833 --> 00:02:52,516
Come on. You know
what I'm worried about?
I'm worried he's gonna
kill himself with that gun

51
00:02:52,516 --> 00:02:55,125
before he gets
old and senile enough
to rewrite us into the will.

52
00:02:55,125 --> 00:02:58,670
That's it. That's it.
We need him to live
long enough
so he can become fully demented.

53
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:02,130
-CHARLIE: I know, but, guys,
I'm picking up, like,
a super stressed-out vibe
from you,

54
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:06,697
and it's really important
to remember, like,
you know,
money isn't everything.

55
00:03:06,781 --> 00:03:11,129
Yeah, of course
you don't care, Charlie,
because your dad didn't have
anything to pass down to you.

56
00:03:11,129 --> 00:03:13,883
No, that's true,
but my mom does. Yeah.

57
00:03:13,908 --> 00:03:17,120
On my mom's family side, I got a
huge inheritance coming my way.

58
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,515
Wait, what?
H-How did I not know this?

59
00:03:20,515 --> 00:03:23,096
- You're gonna be rich?
- Yeah. Totally. Yeah.

60
00:03:23,174 --> 00:03:27,631
Well, uh,
rich in history and legacy
and, uh...

61
00:03:27,631 --> 00:03:29,162
...teeth, of course.

62
00:03:29,162 --> 00:03:32,896
- Teeth?
- Yeah. It's a pretty sweet deal,
actually, you know.

63
00:03:32,896 --> 00:03:35,042
Everyone on my mom's side
of the family,

64
00:03:35,042 --> 00:03:39,387
going back to the NiÃ±a
and the-the Pinta
and the, uh, Santa Margherita,

65
00:03:39,393 --> 00:03:42,813
um, they've all been putting
their teeth into a jar
when they die.

66
00:03:42,813 --> 00:03:48,209
And, uh, when I turn 40,
that sweet little piece
of history's coming my way.

67
00:03:48,209 --> 00:03:50,893
Just stop. Okay, Dee,
we need to get that gun
away from Frank.

68
00:03:50,893 --> 00:03:53,980
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh.
You don't do something
like that.

69
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:57,062
You know, because, like,
Frank's gun is a big piece
of who he is, right?

70
00:03:57,062 --> 00:04:01,644
That's his legacy.
That's his history.
That's like, that's like
my jar of teeth, right?

71
00:04:01,644 --> 00:04:05,160
- I don't want that taken away
from me when I get old.
- What are you talking about?

72
00:04:05,235 --> 00:04:08,157
Charlie, I got some
bad news for you, bud.

73
00:04:08,205 --> 00:04:12,067
- What?
- You turned 40 a long time ago.

74
00:04:14,021 --> 00:04:16,848
Yo. Hey, Ma, how you doing?
-Hi, Mom.

75
00:04:16,848 --> 00:04:19,362
-Oh, hi, boys.
What brings you by?

76
00:04:19,362 --> 00:04:23,175
-Yeah, uh,
hey, I want to show Mac
that jar of family teeth we got.

77
00:04:23,175 --> 00:04:27,504
-Y-You-you do?
-CHARLIE: Yeah.
Hey, Ma, did you realize
I was over 40?

78
00:04:27,504 --> 00:04:29,682
- You are?
- Yeah, turns out.

79
00:04:29,739 --> 00:04:33,602
Yeah, I figured
you probably forgot, too,
or something, but, um, yeah,
can I get that jar of teeth
now, please?

80
00:04:33,602 --> 00:04:35,715
Oh, okay, I-I'll go
look for them.

81
00:04:35,715 --> 00:04:38,425
Okay, yeah, good.
Go-go get my teeth, please.

82
00:04:38,425 --> 00:04:40,165
Cool. Hey, Mom,
since we're here, um,

83
00:04:40,165 --> 00:04:43,248
do we have any kind of, like,
family heirlooms or anything?

84
00:04:43,305 --> 00:04:44,770
No.

85
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:48,968
Like, anything of value
that our family owned
at some point?

86
00:04:48,968 --> 00:04:50,453
No.

87
00:04:50,453 --> 00:04:54,833
Hm. Okay, what if it's just,
like, sentimental?
Just, like,
proof that we existed?

88
00:04:54,833 --> 00:04:56,125
Nope.

89
00:04:56,125 --> 00:04:58,637
Wait, what about those letters?
Weren't there
some kind of letters

90
00:04:58,637 --> 00:05:01,982
that my grandfather
wrote to my dad
during World War II?

91
00:05:01,982 --> 00:05:03,573
Yeah.

92
00:05:03,573 --> 00:05:07,330
- Those letters exist?
Well, well, who's got them?
- Donald.

93
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:10,335
-Donald? Donald who?
-Oh...

94
00:05:10,335 --> 00:05:12,542
Duck.

95
00:05:13,743 --> 00:05:16,042
Donald... Donald Duck?
What's she talking about?

96
00:05:16,042 --> 00:05:18,482
Yeah, my mom's making a joke.
She's-she's really funny.

97
00:05:18,482 --> 00:05:20,306
She's got a great sense
of humor. Right, Mom?

98
00:05:20,306 --> 00:05:21,455
Yeah.

99
00:05:21,455 --> 00:05:23,495
Yeah. She's talking
about my Uncle Donald.

100
00:05:23,495 --> 00:05:26,725
- Huh. I didn't even know
you had an uncle Donald.
- Yeah, yeah,
that's my dad's brother.

101
00:05:26,725 --> 00:05:29,556
- Donald McDonald?
- Yeah.

102
00:05:29,556 --> 00:05:32,838
Ronald McDonald.
Donald McDonald.

103
00:05:32,838 --> 00:05:36,910
Wow. Your dad really scored with
the name Luther, I guess, huh?

104
00:05:37,255 --> 00:05:39,698
Mom? What happened?

105
00:05:39,698 --> 00:05:42,848
-MAC: Oh, shit.
Did she try to pull out
her own teeth?

106
00:05:42,848 --> 00:05:44,499
Did you just try to pull out
your own teeth?

107
00:05:44,561 --> 00:05:48,724
-She clearly did. I can see the pliers.
-We can see the pliers, Mom.

108
00:05:50,105 --> 00:05:52,502
-I'm so sorry.

109
00:05:52,502 --> 00:05:55,305
-CHARLIE: Mom.
Oh, my God. Why did you do that?

110
00:05:55,305 --> 00:05:58,112
I didn't have the heart
to-to tell you,

111
00:05:58,165 --> 00:06:01,112
I gave away the jar.

112
00:06:01,178 --> 00:06:04,949
- You gave away the jar of teeth?
To who?
- Your sisters.

113
00:06:04,949 --> 00:06:09,060
To my sisters?
Those ungrateful bitches.
What the hell, Mom?

114
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:12,660
They don't even live
in Philly anymore.
They moved all the way
up to northern New Jersey.

115
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:15,563
They're terrible to you.
I'm the one who stayed. I'm
the one who takes care of you.

116
00:06:15,618 --> 00:06:17,676
How could you do that?

117
00:06:19,694 --> 00:06:22,566
Now she's screaming.
Now she's screaming.
-Well, you yelled at her.

118
00:06:22,566 --> 00:06:25,488
-Now Mom's screaming.
Now Mom's screaming.

119
00:06:25,575 --> 00:06:27,005
Ah, I can't believe
you did this.

120
00:06:27,005 --> 00:06:30,667
-Why are you yelling at her?
I don't know...
-She gave it away to my sisters.
They're the worst people
on the planet.

121
00:06:30,667 --> 00:06:32,415
I didn't even remember
that you had sisters.

122
00:06:32,415 --> 00:06:35,285
All right. Okay, okay.
Look, we're just gonna have
to go and get them.

123
00:06:35,285 --> 00:06:36,725
I think she's having
a stroke, dude.

124
00:06:36,725 --> 00:06:38,977
We're just gonna have
to get in the car right now
and go get them. Come on, man.

125
00:06:38,977 --> 00:06:42,158
-We should go to the hospital.
- Let's get in the car. Let's go.
Mrs. Mac, we're taking your car.

126
00:06:42,158 --> 00:06:45,205
Mom, just calm down.
It's okay, okay? I'm not mad
at you. It's fine, okay?

127
00:06:45,205 --> 00:06:46,730
-I love you.
-Breathe through your,
breathe through your nose.

128
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:48,540
-I love you, too.
I love you, too.
-This is fucking insane.

129
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:50,445
I made a mistake.

130
00:06:50,445 --> 00:06:52,259
You did make a mistake.
You did make this...

131
00:06:52,259 --> 00:06:56,106
Christ, let's get her
cleaned up. All right.
I didn't mean to upset you.

132
00:06:57,947 --> 00:07:01,753
Frank, um,
could you stop scratching
yourself with the gun, please?

133
00:07:01,753 --> 00:07:03,518
-I'm itchy, I'm itchy.
-I-I bet.

134
00:07:03,518 --> 00:07:06,137
Probably from rolling around
in the grass
outside of your apartment.

135
00:07:06,137 --> 00:07:08,776
No, I was rolling around
in the grass
because I was itchy.

136
00:07:08,776 --> 00:07:09,951
The itch came first.

137
00:07:09,951 --> 00:07:12,597
Okay, well, why don't you
hand me the gun,
and I'll scratch you
with my fingers.

138
00:07:12,597 --> 00:07:14,859
I'm not gonna hand you my gun,
but I'll let you scratch.

139
00:07:14,859 --> 00:07:17,508
You want to scratch me?
Go on. Yeah.

140
00:07:17,508 --> 00:07:19,599
-All right.
-Scratch me. See.

141
00:07:19,937 --> 00:07:22,671
Do it down by the neck.
The back of the neck.
The back of the neck.

142
00:07:22,671 --> 00:07:24,943
-Okay, but I just don't want
to get shot again, is all.

143
00:07:24,943 --> 00:07:27,952
- The gun's not loaded.
- Yeah, that's what you said
last time, Frank.

144
00:07:27,952 --> 00:07:31,101
FRANK:
I got to take a piss.
Pull over.

145
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:43,148
This is not working.
Should we just attack him
and take it?

146
00:07:43,148 --> 00:07:45,807
What? No.
He'd mow us down like Scarface.

147
00:07:45,823 --> 00:07:48,842
We can't come at him like that.
We'll spook him.
-Yeah.

148
00:07:48,842 --> 00:07:51,968
You know what?
He needs to be lulled
into a false sense of security.

149
00:07:51,968 --> 00:07:55,157
You don't tell a dog
you're taking him to a vet
to put him down.

150
00:07:55,157 --> 00:07:59,852
Right.
You give
that dog
the best day of his life,

151
00:07:59,852 --> 00:08:03,082
and then you turn out the lights
when he least suspects it.

152
00:08:03,082 --> 00:08:06,600
-Okay.
Okay. Oh...

153
00:08:08,022 --> 00:08:11,423
Ooh, that was a long wait.

154
00:08:19,562 --> 00:08:21,849
- Why is your mom driving
my mom's car?
- I don't know.

155
00:08:21,849 --> 00:08:25,384
Dude, they got
some weird arrangement
worked out so your mom
can focus on smoking.

156
00:08:25,384 --> 00:08:27,604
Speaking of, I'm getting
choked to death back here.

157
00:08:27,604 --> 00:08:29,973
Mrs. Mac, do you mind, like,
cracking a window or something?

158
00:08:29,973 --> 00:08:31,017
No.

159
00:08:31,017 --> 00:08:33,530
Why not? I mean, it's ridiculous
to just sit in the smoke.

160
00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:36,797
'Cause it's too drafty.
It's unhealthy.

161
00:08:36,797 --> 00:08:38,276
-Right.
-Unheal-- What?

162
00:08:38,365 --> 00:08:40,309
Sorry, my mom's on
a new health kick.

163
00:08:40,309 --> 00:08:42,094
Hey, Mom, it's working.
You look great.

164
00:08:42,094 --> 00:08:43,713
Shut up.

165
00:08:43,713 --> 00:08:46,630
CHARLIE:
Can we, like speed up
or something?
Another car just passed us.

166
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:49,183
Mom, that's, like, the 50th car.
Why are you going so slow?

167
00:08:49,256 --> 00:08:50,916
Well, highways are scary.

168
00:08:50,916 --> 00:08:55,034
You're going 35.
I can see you're going 35.
-But-- And everybody's
just in such a hurry.

169
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:57,581
No, it's just the normal--
It's the speed that people go
on the highway.

170
00:08:57,581 --> 00:08:59,838
Okay, maybe I should drive.
Mom, can I drive your car?

171
00:08:59,838 --> 00:09:01,141
-Can Mac drive?
-No.

172
00:09:01,141 --> 00:09:04,598
Ugh, this is my worst
nightmare, man.
This is absolutely terrible.

173
00:09:04,598 --> 00:09:07,093
How much further?
Anyone know? Mac?

174
00:09:07,093 --> 00:09:11,015
How much further? Mac?
Mac? Hello?

175
00:09:11,015 --> 00:09:14,352
My mom's finger
is up, which means "no talking".

176
00:09:14,352 --> 00:09:17,815
She's annoyed. It's best if we
just keep it down
until the finger goes down,

177
00:09:17,815 --> 00:09:20,617
otherwise, she might burn us
with the cigarette lighter.

178
00:09:20,617 --> 00:09:25,050
This is my worst nightmare
in my entire life.

179
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:27,049
Okay, finger's down. Um, great.

180
00:09:27,049 --> 00:09:31,461
Uh, okay, Mrs. Kelly,
you're gonna want to stay
on the Jersey Turnpike
until you hit 287.

181
00:09:31,461 --> 00:09:33,217
You want to take 287
towards Hamburg.

182
00:09:33,217 --> 00:09:36,399
Mm, no. That--
No, you just stay on the 206
the whole way up.

183
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:39,102
No, no, we're gonna,
we're gonna hit Hamburg
on the way.

184
00:09:39,102 --> 00:09:41,563
- Why are we going to Hamburg?
- We're gonna visit
my Uncle Donald.

185
00:09:41,563 --> 00:09:44,516
-Donald McDonald
of Hamburger, New Jersey?
-Hamburg.

186
00:09:44,516 --> 00:09:48,380
A bunch of old letters that
weren't even written to you?
That's not a legacy, it's
a bunch of meaningless shit.

187
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:50,918
Not as meaningless as a jar
full of teeth.

188
00:09:50,918 --> 00:09:52,866
-CHARLIE: Ah! She got you.
She got you.
-Sorry, Mom, sorry, Mom.

189
00:09:52,866 --> 00:09:55,110
- Sorry, Mom.
I didn't see the finger.
- No, her hand was not
in the air that time.

190
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:56,751
-She burnt the shit out of me.
-You didn't even put your hand--

191
00:09:56,751 --> 00:09:58,776
-Oh, it's up now, it's up now.
-Yeah.

192
00:09:58,776 --> 00:10:01,684
DENNIS:
Frank, we got a little
surprise for you, bud.

193
00:10:01,684 --> 00:10:04,617
- What's that?
- Hamburgers.

194
00:10:04,617 --> 00:10:07,635
-Oh, hamburgers?

195
00:10:07,668 --> 00:10:08,594
Oh, that's one
of the best food there is.

196
00:10:08,594 --> 00:10:10,983
Yeah, yes, they really are.

197
00:10:10,983 --> 00:10:13,131
And, you know what, you can eat
them right here in the car.

198
00:10:13,131 --> 00:10:15,776
You know, once in a while,
they give me the runs.

199
00:10:15,776 --> 00:10:18,984
Yeah, that's why we put
that towel down for you, buddy.

200
00:10:22,087 --> 00:10:26,376
-You want to take it easy?
Goddamn. Just one bite
at a time,
or you're gonna barf everywhere.

201
00:10:26,376 --> 00:10:31,187
-Yeah, it's good, huh?
- Yeah, really hammering them
down there, huh, bud?

202
00:10:35,424 --> 00:10:39,070
I almost ate my gun.
I dipped it in the ketchup.

203
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:42,295
- Thought it was a french fry.
- Yeah, that is funny.

204
00:10:42,295 --> 00:10:44,642
Hey, you know what?
I'm-I'm gonna pull over, Frank.

205
00:10:44,642 --> 00:10:46,459
I got to take a piss anyway.

206
00:10:46,538 --> 00:10:48,634
Again. Okay.

207
00:10:50,481 --> 00:10:52,553
-DENNIS: Well, Frank...
-FRANK: What?

208
00:10:52,553 --> 00:10:55,325
DENNIS:
- Look where we are.
- We're at the bridge.

209
00:10:55,325 --> 00:10:57,445
Oh, I haven't been here
in forever.

210
00:10:57,445 --> 00:10:58,981
-Go check it out--

211
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:03,486
-Did-did you just slam your head
into the window?
- Yeah, I didn't realize
it was up.

212
00:11:03,486 --> 00:11:06,673
- Well, were you gonna
dive out of it?
- Yeah, I was very excited.

213
00:11:06,673 --> 00:11:08,315
- I want to go.
-All right.

214
00:11:08,315 --> 00:11:10,532
-Go see the boys.
-Have fun, buddy.
-Go see the boys.

215
00:11:10,532 --> 00:11:12,476
-Get after it.
-Okay.
-FRANK: Okay.

216
00:11:12,476 --> 00:11:14,519
-I don't know how much
more of this I can take.

217
00:11:14,519 --> 00:11:17,495
Hey, we're almost there, Dee,
okay? He's getting tired.

218
00:11:17,495 --> 00:11:21,480
Let's let run him around
the bridge for a little while,
and then we have
one more stop, okay?
-Uh...

219
00:11:25,196 --> 00:11:27,153
Oh, he's pissing
on another hydrant.

220
00:11:27,153 --> 00:11:30,863
Okay. He's...
literally turning into a dog.

221
00:11:30,863 --> 00:11:32,399
Yeah.

222
00:11:34,997 --> 00:11:37,637
- I got to smash.
- You just smashed.

223
00:11:37,637 --> 00:11:41,447
You smashed,
like, three times
on the way up here.
We keep having to pull over
so you can smash. What...

224
00:11:41,447 --> 00:11:43,727
-There is a lot of smashing.
She's very regular.

225
00:11:43,727 --> 00:11:45,513
Oh, no, I'm out of paper towels.

226
00:11:45,513 --> 00:11:49,613
Oh, I wouldn't worry
about that, Mrs. Kelly.
I'm sure my Uncle Donald
has toilet paper.

227
00:11:49,613 --> 00:11:50,984
You've been wiping
with paper towels?

228
00:11:50,984 --> 00:11:54,787
I hope everyone
brought their appetite

229
00:11:54,787 --> 00:11:58,858
because I made quiche.

230
00:11:59,645 --> 00:12:02,559
Aw, that's really nice,
Uncle Donald,
but we're kind of in a hurry.

231
00:12:02,559 --> 00:12:06,896
W-Well, that's a shame.
We never get to see each other.

232
00:12:06,896 --> 00:12:12,270
Yeah, that is a shame,
but I'm really here
about the letters.

233
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:16,029
You know, the letters that
Grandpop wrote to you and Dad
during the war.

234
00:12:16,029 --> 00:12:19,191
Oh. Oh, yes, yes,
I-I-I have those letters.

235
00:12:19,191 --> 00:12:22,501
Oh, that's great.
I was kind of hoping
they would pass down to me.

236
00:12:22,501 --> 00:12:24,542
You know, sort of like
a family heirloom.

237
00:12:24,542 --> 00:12:29,158
Well, that would make sense
because, well,
they weren't actually
written to me.

238
00:12:29,158 --> 00:12:32,675
They were addressed
only, uh, to your dad.

239
00:12:32,675 --> 00:12:34,964
Grandpop didn't write to you?

240
00:12:34,964 --> 00:12:37,818
He-he liked your dad,
uh... more.

241
00:12:37,818 --> 00:12:41,144
Uh, you know, I was the, um,
you know, "funny" one, you know.

242
00:12:41,144 --> 00:12:43,515
It's the reason
I never got married.

243
00:12:43,515 --> 00:12:46,255
Not something we talked about
back then, but...

244
00:12:46,255 --> 00:12:48,873
but i-it always made me feel,

245
00:12:48,873 --> 00:12:52,870
uh, a little, uh...
different.

246
00:12:53,312 --> 00:12:57,657
Well, I-I'm sure
you can understand
what that feels like, Ronald.

247
00:12:58,542 --> 00:13:00,443
No.

248
00:13:00,443 --> 00:13:04,816
So, the letters?
-Oh, yes.
-Yeah?

249
00:13:04,816 --> 00:13:07,152
-CHARLIE: Oh!
- Sure.

250
00:13:07,152 --> 00:13:08,569
Okay.

251
00:13:08,569 --> 00:13:10,978
Yeah, this is, uh,
this is great, Uncle Donald,

252
00:13:10,978 --> 00:13:14,359
'cause it's really gonna tie
a lot of things together
for me, you know?

253
00:13:14,359 --> 00:13:17,654
It's, uh-- I have something
to pass down to my kids.
It's-it's important
to have a legacy.

254
00:13:17,654 --> 00:13:21,316
Oh, yes. You know, I...
I wouldn't know, though.
I, you know, I...

255
00:13:21,316 --> 00:13:25,500
- I don't have
any children of my own.
- Oh, yeah.

256
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:29,348
-What is this guy's deal?
- It's, like,
everything you've ever wanted.

257
00:13:29,348 --> 00:13:32,773
Kind of sad, really, uh,
me keeping letters

258
00:13:32,807 --> 00:13:34,708
that, uh, weren't even for me.

259
00:13:34,708 --> 00:13:41,146
You know. But, uh...
I guess I just, uh,
wanted a connection, uh...

260
00:13:42,222 --> 00:13:44,710
...with my dad.

261
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:50,330
Yeah.
That is sad.

262
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:54,322
If I could just-- Yeah.
Thank you.
I mean, you know,
there's nothing more...

263
00:13:54,322 --> 00:13:58,710
more important in this world
than the connection
between a father and a son.

264
00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:03,121
Well, besides the connection
between a son and a mother.
Right, Mom?

265
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:07,414
- She's smashing.
-Yeah, she took off, man.

266
00:14:07,414 --> 00:14:08,940
-Yeah, she had to smash.

267
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:11,876
Well, I guess we could wait
for her in the car.

268
00:14:11,876 --> 00:14:14,792
This is so annoying.
I mean, you're gonna
take time out of my day,

269
00:14:14,792 --> 00:14:18,679
and you have everything you've
ever dreamed of right here,
but we're gonna just blow
right past it, aren't we?

270
00:14:18,679 --> 00:14:22,479
It's probably time to go, huh?
-Well, uh, o-okay.
-Yeah.

271
00:14:22,479 --> 00:14:25,713
Okay, well-well, uh,
you know, hey,
if you ever want to, uh,
you know, hang out,

272
00:14:25,713 --> 00:14:28,512
you know, we could throw
the old football around.

273
00:14:28,512 --> 00:14:31,098
Ah, I don't really like
playing football.
It's kind of for jocks.

274
00:14:31,098 --> 00:14:33,956
-It's all he ever talks about...
...is wanting to have
a catch with his dad, so...

275
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:36,895
Nah, 'cause remember
we were talking about how
it was like a... for jocks?

276
00:14:36,895 --> 00:14:38,850
-Uh, no. That never happened.
-Oh.

277
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:42,171
Uh, yeah, well, uh,
we could read.
We could read.
-Oh, but, like, he can't read.

278
00:14:42,171 --> 00:14:45,623
-Imagine that. Imagine that.
Yeah, but he's not talking
about me, he's talking about
-bonding with you.

279
00:14:45,623 --> 00:14:48,752
- But we're gonna
blow right past this, huh?
- Reading is for nerds, so...

280
00:14:48,752 --> 00:14:50,785
-Yeah, is that what it is?
-Yeah.

281
00:14:50,818 --> 00:14:53,382
-Uh, cards?
-Uh, well,
the thing about cards
is, like, with the...

282
00:14:53,382 --> 00:14:57,983
the jacks and the queens
and the kings and, like,
I don't like
celebrating royalty.

283
00:14:57,983 --> 00:15:01,624
-Oh, my God, dude.
Oh, my God, man.
-You know that.
We've talked about that.

284
00:15:01,624 --> 00:15:04,366
You're driving me crazy, dude.
All right, fine, let's go.

285
00:15:04,369 --> 00:15:06,820
-Bye-bye.
-Okay, maybe you guys
can swap phone numbers or...

286
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:11,423
-No? No, not gonna do it?
Fine, then this was a good
waste of our time, wasn't it?

287
00:15:12,828 --> 00:15:17,760
-Well, t
-Yep.
-Mm.

288
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:22,420
DENNIS: Beautiful.
Probably brings back
a lot of good memories.
-Right, Frank?
-Absolutely.

289
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:27,795
-You guys, uh, mind if I...
-Oh, no. Of course. No, please.
Please. Yeah.
-Please. Yeah.

290
00:15:28,053 --> 00:15:30,716
Take that you, cesspool.

291
00:15:30,716 --> 00:15:32,799
Polluted sack of shit.

292
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:35,955
You know, Dee, I kind of feel
like we did a good thing here.

293
00:15:35,955 --> 00:15:39,448
I do, too.
We gave him a good day.

294
00:15:39,448 --> 00:15:41,575
-For him.
Not for a normal person.

295
00:15:41,645 --> 00:15:43,858
-Yeah. Jesus.

296
00:15:45,807 --> 00:15:49,818
You all done, bud?
-Yeah. Thanks, guys.
-Yeah.

297
00:15:49,818 --> 00:15:52,907
-Good. Hey, oh, absolutely.
Hey, listen,
where to now, Frank?

298
00:15:52,907 --> 00:15:54,954
-We want to take you somewhere.
-Uh, no, it's okay. I get it.

299
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:58,840
I-I thought it was
a cash grab at first,
but I see where you're going.

300
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:02,399
The hamburger, playing
with Duncan under the bridge,
and now the beach.

301
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:06,079
A perfect day
can't last forever.
I know why we're here.

302
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:08,630
Oh. You do?

303
00:16:08,692 --> 00:16:11,456
Gosh.
Thanks for making it
so easy on us.

304
00:16:11,456 --> 00:16:13,131
-We expected more resistance.
-Yeah.

305
00:16:13,131 --> 00:16:15,825
- Well, I guess hung on
a little bit too long.
-A little bit.

306
00:16:15,825 --> 00:16:18,190
-And afterwards,
you guys can have the money.

307
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:19,603
-Really?
-You mean it?

308
00:16:19,678 --> 00:16:21,691
Yeah. Here.

309
00:16:21,691 --> 00:16:23,813
Oh. Gosh.

310
00:16:23,813 --> 00:16:27,960
I-I got to say, this-this went
so much more smoothly than I...
-Yeah, it really did.

311
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:30,996
Uh, just do it when I'm looking
out at the ocean.

312
00:16:34,403 --> 00:16:36,831
Ah, don't be coy.
I had a good run.

313
00:16:36,831 --> 00:16:39,524
-What are you...
-And it's really good
you didn't do it
in front of Charlie.

314
00:16:39,524 --> 00:16:43,074
That was a class move.
Just put me down quick.

315
00:16:43,665 --> 00:16:45,541
Put you down? Wha...

316
00:16:45,639 --> 00:16:49,521
Oh, you know what?
I think I'm gonna run,
and then you do
what you have to do.

317
00:16:49,521 --> 00:16:53,471
But if you shoot me in the leg,
come over and finish me off,
because I don't want
to lay there and suffer.

318
00:16:53,471 --> 00:16:56,321
-Actually, here,
I'm gonna take...
-What?
What the hell are you doing?

319
00:16:56,321 --> 00:16:57,639
I'm gonna go natural,

320
00:16:57,639 --> 00:17:02,097
because I've seen too many guys die
and take a shit in their pants.
I don't want that.

321
00:17:02,097 --> 00:17:05,462
And bury my poop.
Or just kick some sand over it.

322
00:17:05,462 --> 00:17:09,773
'Cause-- And then you can do
what you want to do.
You can float me out into
the ocean and let sharks eat me.

323
00:17:09,773 --> 00:17:12,965
Or you can leave me
on the ground,
gruesome for the kids to see.

324
00:17:12,965 --> 00:17:17,345
Oh, ugh. Oh, my God.
We are not gonna
kill you, Frank.
-Huh?

325
00:17:17,430 --> 00:17:22,117
-What, did you think
we were just gonna shoot you
right here on the beach?
I mean,
there-there's people around.

326
00:17:22,117 --> 00:17:25,215
I'm actually surprised
they didn't run
when you started
shooting the ocean.

327
00:17:25,215 --> 00:17:27,764
-I-I'm not.
It's the Jersey Shore.
But good God, man.

328
00:17:27,764 --> 00:17:30,746
Well, if you're not gonna
snuff me out,
what the hell are you doing?

329
00:17:30,746 --> 00:17:34,374
- We were giving you
one last day with your gun.
- Yeah, it's time
to let it go, Frank.

330
00:17:34,374 --> 00:17:36,729
You were stealing my gun?
Screw that.

331
00:17:36,729 --> 00:17:39,505
No, it's too dangerous, Frank.
You're out of control
with that thing.

332
00:17:39,505 --> 00:17:41,050
By the way,
you're out of the will again.

333
00:17:41,050 --> 00:17:42,797
-What?
-Why? Just because of the gun?
-Yeah.

334
00:17:42,797 --> 00:17:45,698
Exactly. Because I don't
trust you two guys.

335
00:17:45,698 --> 00:17:50,692
I mean, if you're in the will,
who knows?
You may wind up
shooting me in the back.

336
00:17:50,692 --> 00:17:52,900
-Ah!
-You just told us
to shoot you in the back!

337
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:55,499
That's different.
It's not the same thing.
Take me back to Philly.

338
00:17:55,499 --> 00:17:56,853
You get an Uber.

339
00:17:56,853 --> 00:17:58,152
-DENNIS: Yeah.
-Get in the car.

340
00:17:58,152 --> 00:18:02,121
-Goddamn it.
Dee,
why'd you let him snatch
that thing back?
-I-I...

341
00:18:03,841 --> 00:18:05,794
All right, let's go.

342
00:18:05,794 --> 00:18:09,508
-Just barge right in, Mom.
Don't-don't be shy, okay?

343
00:18:09,508 --> 00:18:13,188
Bunny?
Candy?

344
00:18:13,188 --> 00:18:14,730
-Are you home?

345
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:16,420
-Which one is the can?

346
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:20,518
There's probably, like,
a million bathrooms.
Just go find a bathroom,
Mrs. Mac.

347
00:18:20,518 --> 00:18:22,852
-I don't remember those
being your sisters' names.

348
00:18:22,852 --> 00:18:24,991
No, it's not their names.
They had their names changed.

349
00:18:24,991 --> 00:18:29,649
- Oh. How do they afford
to live like this?
- T-They're doing
some, like, stupid,
like, social media thing.

350
00:18:29,649 --> 00:18:31,296
I-I don't know, I guess
they're making a killing on it.

351
00:18:31,296 --> 00:18:34,109
Hey! Candy, Bunny!

352
00:18:34,109 --> 00:18:36,745
-Oh, my God.
BOTH:
Mom, what are you doing here?

353
00:18:36,745 --> 00:18:38,043
Well, we just wanted
to drive up...

354
00:18:38,043 --> 00:18:39,571
BOTH:
Why'd you bring Dirt Grub?

355
00:18:39,571 --> 00:18:42,096
- Oh, yeah, hi.
Nice to see you, too.
BOTH:
Shut up, fag!

356
00:18:42,096 --> 00:18:44,627
- Why'd you bring your fag friend?
- Yeah, why is Mac here?

357
00:18:44,627 --> 00:18:47,981
-This is so distasteful.
- Uh, dude, uh...

358
00:18:47,981 --> 00:18:49,998
You know what? I'm not
gonna argue with you guys.
-Oh, you're not?

359
00:18:49,998 --> 00:18:51,256
-Okay? No, I'm just here
for the teeth.

360
00:18:51,256 --> 00:18:54,906
-No, you can't have them.
- Yeah, you can't
have them, Charlie.
-Mom gave them to us.

361
00:18:54,906 --> 00:18:58,182
Well, what do you even care
about the teeth?
I-I thought you always said
they were weird and gross.

362
00:18:58,182 --> 00:19:01,591
-They are weird and gross.
-Yeah, super gross,
but people like that stuff,
so we need them.

363
00:19:01,591 --> 00:19:02,933
-We need them.
-Need them for what?

364
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:06,547
- ASMR, dickweed.
- Yeah. ASMR.

365
00:19:06,547 --> 00:19:08,504
What is that? What even is that?

366
00:19:08,504 --> 00:19:11,218
We stick our hands in the jar.

367
00:19:11,218 --> 00:19:14,430
People pay to watch us
stick our hand in the jar.
They pay for that shit.

368
00:19:14,430 --> 00:19:18,233
-Yeah.
They like the noise
of the teeth,
and they give us a lot
of money on OnlyFans.

369
00:19:18,233 --> 00:19:20,703
Like, a lot of money.
More than you could
ever imagine.
-Yeah.

370
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:25,090
All your doing is sticking
your hands in teeth
and people pay you enough
to live like this?

371
00:19:25,090 --> 00:19:27,756
-We obviously take
our tops off. Like...
-Obviously.

372
00:19:27,756 --> 00:19:28,819
-Oh, girls.

373
00:19:28,819 --> 00:19:31,116
-BUNNY: Oh, my God. Shut up, slut.
-You're literally a slut.

374
00:19:31,116 --> 00:19:32,809
All right, you know what? Give
me the teeth. Give me the teeth.

375
00:19:32,899 --> 00:19:35,372
- No. Finders keepers, bitch.
-You did not find them!

376
00:19:35,372 --> 00:19:37,334
-Mom gave them to you.
-Yeah, she did. Okay, we're her favorite.

377
00:19:37,334 --> 00:19:39,153
-I clogged the toilet.

378
00:19:39,215 --> 00:19:42,413
-What the hell? Gross.
-Who is this old lady
clogging our toilet?

379
00:19:42,413 --> 00:19:44,832
- That's my mommy.
- BOTH: Gross, Mac!

380
00:19:44,832 --> 00:19:48,031
- Why did you clog our toilet?
- Why'd you clog our toilet,
old lady?

381
00:19:48,031 --> 00:19:50,207
There was no TP.

382
00:19:50,207 --> 00:19:52,981
If there was no TP,
what did you wipe with?

383
00:19:52,981 --> 00:19:55,214
The letters.

384
00:19:55,276 --> 00:20:00,148
You wiped your butt
with the letters
that Grandpop sent Dad and then
flushed them down the toilet?

385
00:20:00,214 --> 00:20:02,179
Yeah.

386
00:20:02,179 --> 00:20:04,991
-BUNNY: Oh, my God.
This is so weird, guys.
You got to go.

387
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:07,824
-All right, you know what?
-No. No. Hey, hey. Put that down.

388
00:20:07,824 --> 00:20:09,659
This is gonna be
the new Kelly family heirloom,

389
00:20:09,659 --> 00:20:11,505
and I'm gonna put
all my teeth in it

390
00:20:11,539 --> 00:20:14,890
and all of Mom's teeth in it
and none of yours.

391
00:20:18,109 --> 00:20:20,252
Oh, uh, yep.
Yep. Yep.

392
00:20:20,252 --> 00:20:22,734
You got to stop
doing that. You're not gonna
have any teeth left.

393
00:20:22,806 --> 00:20:25,579
You sure you don't want
to pop a couple in?
You know, you can be
a part of my legacy, dude.

394
00:20:25,652 --> 00:20:27,588
- I-I feel like you should be.
-No, I-I'm good.

395
00:20:27,588 --> 00:20:31,105
-Yeah?
All right, I'll tell you what.
When one-one falls out,
go ahead and toss it in.

396
00:20:31,105 --> 00:20:32,764
-It's cool.
-It won't.

397
00:20:36,553 --> 00:20:39,357
Yeah. There. Take that, lock.

398
00:20:39,357 --> 00:20:43,512
- Oh, what the hell, man?
- And the door wasn't even locked.

399
00:20:43,512 --> 00:20:46,405
- You're paying
for that door, Frank.
- All right, all right.

400
00:20:46,405 --> 00:20:48,449
Well, this is great.
This is just great.

401
00:20:48,449 --> 00:20:50,884
You know, like, now
what are we supposed to all put
our teeth in?

402
00:20:50,978 --> 00:20:52,901
-Our faces?
What are you talking about?

403
00:20:52,970 --> 00:20:55,200
-I'm talking about our legacy.
You know?
I can't hold onto it, man.

404
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,070
Legacy? You want to talk legacy?
You know what our legacy is?

405
00:20:57,070 --> 00:21:00,532
Spending our lives
in this goddamn bar
with a lunatic man
who acts like a dog

406
00:21:00,532 --> 00:21:02,311
and handles
his gun like a maniac!

407
00:21:02,378 --> 00:21:07,273
Oh, fine.
I see where this
pity party's headed.

408
00:21:07,273 --> 00:21:12,470
If you're gonna be
crybabies about it,
all right, take my gun.

409
00:21:16,738 --> 00:21:18,680
Shit.

410
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,643
