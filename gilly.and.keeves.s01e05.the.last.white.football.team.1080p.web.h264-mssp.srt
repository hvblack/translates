1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,024
seats

2
00:00:02,024 --> 00:00:04,096
now as most of you know

3
00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:07,507
our conference has decided to integrate
this season

4
00:00:07,507 --> 00:00:08,586
boo

5
00:00:08,586 --> 00:00:11,889
settle down as long as i'm head coach at
chapel creek

6
00:00:11,889 --> 00:00:13,932
i promise you this will be
a white football team

7
00:00:13,932 --> 00:00:16,431
that's right
because football is a white male

8
00:00:16,431 --> 00:00:17,934
paul is a white man sport

9
00:00:17,934 --> 00:00:20,603
a lot of people think that oh
since we've been to the moon last year

10
00:00:20,603 --> 00:00:22,839
that
we're you know should be more
enlightened

11
00:00:22,839 --> 00:00:25,915
i don't know what's more
enlightening than just white people
having fun together

12
00:00:25,915 --> 00:00:28,467
that's right when we
went to the moon guess what we found

13
00:00:28,467 --> 00:00:29,564
what was what

14
00:00:29,564 --> 00:00:32,584
and let me tell you
something you can print this in your
little papers

15
00:00:32,584 --> 00:00:36,870
week one we're gonna rain hell down on
these black sun [ __ ]

16
00:00:37,734 --> 00:00:39,071
loses

17
00:00:39,071 --> 00:00:40,987
start

18
00:00:43,647 --> 00:00:46,380
i think we might have taken it too easy on us

19
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:49,998
that's it we took it too easy on
that that's my fault that's my fault

20
00:00:49,998 --> 00:00:52,153
week two i'm gonna switch up the offense

21
00:00:52,153 --> 00:00:55,190
you thought that was a little run heavy
i agree we're gonna start airing it out on

22
00:00:55,190 --> 00:00:58,985
that's right we're coming from the
sky this week boys death from above

23
00:00:58,985 --> 00:01:00,932
loss

24
00:01:00,932 --> 00:01:02,410
35-0

25
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:05,117
god damn it what the [ __ ] going on i
don't know what's going on out there

26
00:01:05,117 --> 00:01:09,194
the
school board has informed me that we are
going to be forced to integrate

27
00:01:09,194 --> 00:01:10,256
what

28
00:01:10,256 --> 00:01:12,544
we're going to start the
integration process

29
00:01:12,544 --> 00:01:14,752
with hiring our first black coach

30
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:17,769
coach johnson's going to be joining our staff

31
00:01:18,473 --> 00:01:21,830
coach johnson's going to be taking over
running the defense for us

32
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:23,546
wait

33
00:01:23,611 --> 00:01:25,819
a minute i run the defense now

34
00:01:25,819 --> 00:01:28,279
this does mean we are going to have some
black players

35
00:01:28,279 --> 00:01:30,636
i'm going to start the white
players in the first half

36
00:01:30,636 --> 00:01:33,401
get out a big lead a commanding lead on

37
00:01:33,401 --> 00:01:35,654
and we're going to let the black players
come in in the second half

38
00:01:35,654 --> 00:01:38,460
and try to
you know try to play the game a little
bit

39
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:40,255
miracle

40
00:01:40,255 --> 00:01:43,906
what a comeback down 48 in the first half

41
00:01:43,906 --> 00:01:46,206
but god damn we came back and won
that thing huh

42
00:01:46,206 --> 00:01:47,172
that's coaching

43
00:01:47,172 --> 00:01:51,176
well the next one next week we do a
black players first half

44
00:01:51,176 --> 00:01:52,959
white play the
second half

45
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:55,492
all right i just thought of something

46
00:01:55,492 --> 00:01:56,749
disastrous

47
00:01:56,749 --> 00:02:00,114
golly those white boys almost blew that
for us didn't they

48
00:02:00,114 --> 00:02:01,872
hey i'm i'm sensing a pattern

49
00:02:01,872 --> 00:02:04,121
pattern
i'm sensing the pattern myself

50
00:02:04,122 --> 00:02:05,671
defense

51
00:02:05,671 --> 00:02:08,805
i told you we'd start winning again
that's a winning streak

52
00:02:08,805 --> 00:02:11,453
y'all gonna have to start making some
room in these chunky cases

53
00:02:11,453 --> 00:02:12,894
these are an
old starting quarterback

54
00:02:12,894 --> 00:02:14,800
i was starting a guy that had polio

55
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,471
i didn't know teenagers could look 45 years old

56
00:02:17,471 --> 00:02:19,840
now we're playing teams

57
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,066
quarterbacks are running now
quarterback can run

58
00:02:21,066 --> 00:02:23,101
uh the correct term is scrambling

59
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:25,948
scrambling isn't that fun scrambling

60
00:02:25,948 --> 00:02:27,965
