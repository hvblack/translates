1
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:04,881
>>> THIS WEEK, WE SAW

2
00:00:04,881 --> 00:00:09,904
THE
HORRIBLE IMAGES AND STORIES FROM
ISRAEL AND GAZA,

3
00:00:08,903 --> 00:00:10,923
AND I KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE THINKING,

4
00:00:10,923 --> 00:00:14,343
WHO BETTER TO COMMENT ON IT THAN PETE
DAVIDSON.

5
00:00:14,343 --> 00:00:18,663
WELL, IN A LOT OF WAYS, I AM A
GOOD PERSON TO TALK ABOUT IT

6
00:00:18,663 --> 00:00:22,848
BECAUSE WHEN I WAS 7 YEARS OLD,
MY DAD WAS KILLED IN A TERRORIST
ATTACK.

7
00:00:22,848 --> 00:00:26,253
SO I KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT WHAT
THAT'S LIKE.

8
00:00:26,253 --> 00:00:31,793
I SAW SO MANY TERRIBLE PICTURES
THIS WEEK OF CHILDREN SUFFERING,

9
00:00:31,793 --> 00:00:34,752
ISRAELI CHILDREN AND PALESTINIAN CHILDREN,

10
00:00:34,752 --> 00:00:39,622
AND IT TOOK ME BACK TO
A REALLY HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE PLACE,

11
00:00:39,622 --> 00:00:44,329
AND NO ONE IN THIS WORLD
DESERVES TO SUFFER LIKE THAT,

12
00:00:44,329 --> 00:00:47,254
ESPECIALLY NOT KIDS.

13
00:00:47,316 --> 00:00:52,378
AFTER MY DAD DIED, MY MOM TRIED
PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING

14
00:00:52,378 --> 00:00:53,690
SHE COULD
DO TO CHEER ME UP.

15
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:55,878
I REMEMBER ONE DAY WHEN I WAS 8,

16
00:00:55,878 --> 00:00:58,984
SHE GOT ME WHAT SHE THOUGHT WAS
A DISNEY MOVIE,

17
00:00:58,984 --> 00:01:04,406
BUT IT WAS
ACTUALLY THE EDDIE MURPHY
STANDUP SPECIAL DELIRIOUS.

18
00:01:05,404 --> 00:01:07,896
WE PLAYED IT IN THE CAR ON THE WAY HOME,

19
00:01:07,896 --> 00:01:10,802
AND WHEN SHE HEARD THE
THINGS EDDIE MURPHY WAS SAYING,

20
00:01:10,802 --> 00:01:13,068
SHE TRIED TO TAKE IT AWAY.

21
00:01:13,068 --> 00:01:15,134
BUT THEN SHE NOTICED SOMETHING,

22
00:01:15,134 --> 00:01:19,978
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN A LONG
TIME, I WAS LAUGHING AGAIN.

23
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:23,365
I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT.
I REALLY DON'T, AND I NEVER WILL,

24
00:01:23,365 --> 00:01:28,103
BUT SOMETIMES COMEDY IS
REALLY THE ONLY WAY FORWARD
THROUGH TRAGEDY.

25
00:01:28,103 --> 00:01:33,849
MY HEART IS WITH EVERYONE WHOSE
LIVES HAVE BEEN DESTROYED THIS
WEEK.

26
00:01:33,849 --> 00:01:38,589
BUT TONIGHT, I'M GOING TO DO
WHAT I'VE ALWAYS DONE IN THE FACE OF TRAGEDY,

27
00:01:38,589 --> 00:01:40,989
AND THAT'S TRY
TO BE FUNNY.

28
00:01:40,989 --> 00:01:45,220
REMEMBER, I SAID TRY.

29
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:48,799
AND LIVE FROM NEW YORK, IT'S
SATURDAY NIGHT.

30
00:03:55,294 --> 00:04:00,073
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, PETE
DAVIDSON.

31
00:04:18,098 --> 00:04:21,768
>>> THANK YOU.
IT'S GREAT TO BE BACK.
ALL RIGHT.

32
00:04:21,768 --> 00:04:23,883
ALL RIGHT.
I'M GOING TO GET RIGHT INTO IT.

33
00:04:23,883 --> 00:04:28,310
I AM TRYING TO BOND WITH MY
SISTER.

34
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:30,422
YOU KNOW, I'M ABOUT TO BE 30.

35
00:04:30,422 --> 00:04:32,651
I'M TURNING 30 NEXT MONTH.

36
00:04:33,389 --> 00:04:36,291
IT'S OVER.
YOU KNOW, IT'S OVER.

37
00:04:36,291 --> 00:04:40,901
TRYING TO BOND WITH MY SISTER.
I FEEL LIKE WE SHOULD HAVE A
BETTER RELATIONSHIP.

38
00:04:40,901 --> 00:04:43,594
ME AND MY SISTER HAVE NOTHING IN
COMMON.

39
00:04:43,594 --> 00:04:46,111
SHE ASSISTS BRAIN SURGERY,

40
00:04:46,111 --> 00:04:49,070
AND I'M A DRUG ADDICT.

41
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:51,282
SO NOTHING.

42
00:04:51,282 --> 00:04:55,004
SO I WAS TRYING TO FIND
SOMETHING WE COULD DO SO WE COULD BOND,

43
00:04:55,004 --> 00:04:56,797
AND I WAS LIKE, WE
SHOULD WATCH A TV SHOW.

44
00:04:56,797 --> 00:04:58,978
THAT'S EASY.
YOU DON'T GOT TO DO ANYTHING.

45
00:04:58,978 --> 00:05:02,384
YOU JUST SIT THERE.
EVERY FIVE MINUTES YOU'RE LIKE,
EH, OH.

46
00:05:03,957 --> 00:05:06,757
I WAS LIKE, WE'LL DO THIS.

47
00:05:06,757 --> 00:05:11,258
ME AND MY SISTER BOTH NEVER SAW
GAME OF THRONES, RIGHT?

48
00:05:11,258 --> 00:05:13,533
I KNOW.

49
00:05:13,533 --> 00:05:15,722
I DIDN'T KNOW.
IT'S THE NUMBER ONE SHOW IN THE
WORLD.

50
00:05:15,722 --> 00:05:18,183
I HAD NO IDEA HOW SICK EVERYONE
IS.

51
00:05:18,183 --> 00:05:21,930
I THOUGHT IT WAS LIKE DRAGONS
AND STUFF, AND MAGIC.

52
00:05:21,983 --> 00:05:23,594
HARDLY ANY DRAGONS.

53
00:05:23,594 --> 00:05:27,615
LOTS OF INCEST, TONS OF INCEST.

54
00:05:27,615 --> 00:05:29,432
SO MUCH INCEST.

55
00:05:29,432 --> 00:05:32,515
YOU CAN LEAVE THE HOUSE, COME
BACK, INCEST STILL HAPPENING.

56
00:05:32,515 --> 00:05:34,537
IT'S A VERY WEIRD SHOW TO WATCH

57
00:05:34,537 --> 00:05:39,014
WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO FIND
COMMON GROUND WITH YOUR SISTER.

58
00:05:39,656 --> 00:05:42,597
I WAS SO UNCOMFORTABLE WATCHING
THIS, GUYS.

59
00:05:42,597 --> 00:05:46,223
I WAS WATCHING, AND I WAS LIKE,
THIS IS SO WEIRD, YOU KNOW.

60
00:05:46,223 --> 00:05:49,680
WONDER HOW SHE FEELS, YOU KNOW.

61
00:05:49,886 --> 00:05:52,393
SO I PUT OUT A FEELER.

62
00:05:52,393 --> 00:05:56,581
I WAS LIKE, HEY, THIS IS PRETTY
WEIRD, HUH?

63
00:05:56,581 --> 00:05:59,863
AND SHE WAS LIKE, I LOVE IT!

64
00:06:04,663 --> 00:06:07,837
I WAS LIKE, YEAH, BUT, YOU KNOW,

65
00:06:07,837 --> 00:06:10,174
THE INCEST, YOU KNOW.

66
00:06:10,174 --> 00:06:13,434
IT'S LIKE A NO-GO, RIGHT?

67
00:06:13,434 --> 00:06:18,599
SHE WAS -- SHE WAS LIKE, WELL,
IT WAS A DIFFERENT TIME.

68
00:06:22,206 --> 00:06:26,107
I WAS LIKE, AM I ABOUT TO BANG
THIS CHICK?
WHAT'S GOING ON.

69
00:06:29,288 --> 00:06:32,432
I PROBABLY WOULDN'T GET HER.
I'M TOO INSECURE.

70
00:06:32,432 --> 00:06:34,615
I'M VERY INSECURE, YOU GUYS.

71
00:06:34,615 --> 00:06:38,664
I THINK IT'S BECAUSE THE HIGH
SCHOOL FOOTBALL COACH USED TO
CALL ME A PUSSY,

72
00:06:38,664 --> 00:06:41,020
AND I WASN'T
EVEN ON THE TEAM.

73
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:45,028
JUST FIND ME IN CLASS, PUSSY.

74
00:06:47,113 --> 00:06:52,247
I'M A -- YOU GUYS, I'M FROM
STATEN ISLAND, SO THIS IS A BIG
DEAL TO ME.

75
00:06:52,247 --> 00:06:54,328
I GREW UP RIGHT AROUND HERE.

76
00:06:54,328 --> 00:06:57,610
IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT STATEN
ISLAND IS, IT'S THE ONLY ISLAND IN THE WORLD

77
00:06:57,610 --> 00:07:01,439
WITH A WORSE
REPUTATION THAN EPSTEIN'S
SOMEHOW.

78
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:05,750
BUT IN STATEN ISLAND, THE KIDS
MOLEST THE PRIESTS.

79
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:09,048
EVERYTHING'S BACKWARDS DOWN
THERE.

80
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:14,738
YOU KNOW, A LOT OF PEOPLE ASK
ME -- AND BY THAT, I MEAN TWO --

81
00:07:14,738 --> 00:07:17,952
IS THIS WHAT I WANTED TO DO WHEN I GREW UP,

82
00:07:17,952 --> 00:07:19,387
AND NO, I AM FROM
STATEN ISLAND.

83
00:07:19,387 --> 00:07:22,320
MY DREAM WAS TO BE A
CONSTRUCTION WORKER.

84
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:27,577
IT WAS.
HOPEFULLY WORK FOR A
CONSTRUCTION COMPANY FOR LIKE EIGHT YEARS,

85
00:07:27,577 --> 00:07:30,581
AND IF I'M LUCKY,
FALL OFF A LADDER.

86
00:07:30,581 --> 00:07:34,228
SUE THE CITY FOR 6 MIL, SETTLE
FOR 3.

87
00:07:34,228 --> 00:07:38,015
MARRY A CHICK I HAD A CRUSH ON
IN HIGH SCHOOL

88
00:07:38,015 --> 00:07:42,370
THAT I'M NOT
REALLY INTO ANYMORE, BUT NO ONE
ELSE CAN HAVE HER!

89
00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:48,436
THAT WAS MY DREAM.
I REMEMBER THE FIRST NIGHT I
WENT TO DO A STANDUP SHOW.

90
00:07:48,436 --> 00:07:51,353
I LOVE THIS STORY.
IT'S LIKE MY ORIGIN STORY.

91
00:07:51,353 --> 00:07:54,680
I USED TO HAVE SEX WITH THIS
GIRL IN MY CAR.

92
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:57,298
BECAUSE IN STATEN ISLAND, IT'S
LIKE A CONDO.

93
00:07:57,298 --> 00:08:02,473
SO WE WERE IN MY TWO-BEDROOM
CHEROKEE -- WITH A VIEW.

94
00:08:02,473 --> 00:08:06,038
THIS GIRL WAS AWESOME.
SHE WAS JUST A SEX FRIEND.

95
00:08:06,038 --> 00:08:08,573
IT WAS HER IDEA.
SHE WAS AWESOME.

96
00:08:08,573 --> 00:08:11,516
THEY DON'T MAKE THEM LIKE THAT
ANYMORE, YOU KNOW.

97
00:08:11,516 --> 00:08:14,027
THE GOOD OLE BROADS.

98
00:08:14,027 --> 00:08:19,257
I REMEMBER IT WAS ACTUALLY THE
FIRST NIGHT I EVER HAD A STANDUP SHOW,

99
00:08:19,257 --> 00:08:22,201
BUT I FORGOT BECAUSE I WAS
HAVING SEX, RIGHT,

100
00:08:22,201 --> 00:08:25,037
AND I
ACTUALLY DIDN'T REALIZE UNTIL
AFTER I FINISHED.

101
00:08:25,037 --> 00:08:26,311
LIKE IMMEDIATELY AFTER.

102
00:08:26,311 --> 00:08:27,320
I WAS LIKE, AH -- AHH, 

103
00:08:28,524 --> 00:08:30,533
I'M LATE!

104
00:08:30,533 --> 00:08:33,311
AND EARLY, RELAX.

105
00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:36,415
AND I WAS SO NERVOUS TO TELL
THIS GIRL.

106
00:08:36,415 --> 00:08:39,169
THAT'S SO RUDE.
I DIDN'T WANT TO BE LIKE, WELL,
BYE.

107
00:08:39,169 --> 00:08:41,813
BECAUSE WE WERE SUPPOSED TO GET
PIZZA AFTER.

108
00:08:41,813 --> 00:08:44,479
THAT'S MY GUARANTEE.

109
00:08:44,479 --> 00:08:47,508
DO
GET A SLICE.

110
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:53,609
I WAS SO NERVOUS TO TELL
HER.

111
00:08:53,609 --> 00:08:58,151
I WAS LIKE, I'M SO SORRY, I
FORGOT I HAVE A SHOW TONIGHT IN
THE CITY.

112
00:08:58,151 --> 00:08:59,879
CAN WE GET PIZZA TOMORROW.

113
00:08:59,879 --> 00:09:02,956
SHE WAS LIKE, OF COURSE.
YOU'RE TRYING TO DO STANDUP?

114
00:09:02,956 --> 00:09:05,580
THAT'S AMAZING.
GO FOR IT.
THAT'S SO COOL.

115
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:08,275
I WAS LIKE, WOW, THANKS.

116
00:09:08,275 --> 00:09:11,626
THEN SHE SAID SOMETHING, YOU
GUYS, THAT I'LL NEVER FORGET.

117
00:09:11,626 --> 00:09:16,317
I STILL THINK ABOUT IT TODAY.
SHE SAID THE COOLEST THING
ANYBODY'S EVER SAID TO ME.

118
00:09:16,317 --> 00:09:18,160
SHE'S PUTTING ON HER SHIRT, AND SHE GOES,

119
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:23,146
HEY, MAYBE ONE DAY
I'LL BE WATCHING TV WITH MY HUSBAND,

120
00:09:23,146 --> 00:09:25,473
AND YOU'LL POP ON.

121
00:09:28,839 --> 00:09:34,007
AND THEN I'LL TURN TO MY
HUSBAND, AND I'LL GO, HEY, I
BANGED THAT GUY.

122
00:09:35,818 --> 00:09:41,040
AND I REMEMBER, I WAS LIKE, WHAT
DID YOU READ MY DIARY?
WHO SAYS THAT.

123
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,961
THAT WAS SO COOL.
WHO SAYS THAT.

124
00:09:42,961 --> 00:09:47,309
I REMEMBER BEING ALL HYPED UP
DRIVING TO THE CITY LIKE I'M
GOING TO BE A COMEDIAN.

125
00:09:47,309 --> 00:09:50,659
AND I THINK ABOUT THAT BECAUSE
IT'S VERY SPECIAL.

126
00:09:50,659 --> 00:09:52,789
SHE KIND OF PREDICTED THE
FUTURE.
THAT'S VERY COOL.

127
00:09:52,789 --> 00:09:55,081
I DID GET ON TV.

128
00:09:55,081 --> 00:09:58,682
SHE TRAGICALLY DIED OF AN
OVERDOSE TWO YEARS LATER.

129
00:09:58,682 --> 00:10:01,853
YES, THAT'S VERY SAD.
SHE WAS ONE FOR TWO.

130
00:10:03,616 --> 00:10:06,123
AND I FOUND OUT -- THIS IS
MESSED UP.

131
00:10:06,123 --> 00:10:11,379
I WAS ACTUALLY WATCHING TV WITH
MY GIRLFRIEND, AND SHE POPPED
ON.

132
00:10:15,962 --> 00:10:19,591
AND THEN I TURNED TO MY
GIRLFRIEND, AND I WENT, HEY,

133
00:10:21,071 --> 00:10:23,193
I
BANGED THAT GIRL.

134
00:10:23,193 --> 00:10:27,616
WE GOT A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU

TAYLOR SWIFT FANS ARE WATCHING,

154
00:11:40,801 --> 00:11:42,400
THE CHIEFS GAME WAS ON THURSDAY.

155
00:11:42,402 --> 00:11:43,435
YOU JUST MISSED HER.

156
00:11:43,437 --> 00:11:44,269

LISTEN, SORRY, SWIFTIES, THIS IS

158
00:11:46,473 --> 00:11:48,206
A SHOW ABOUT FOOTBALL.

159
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:48,640
IT'S A SPORT.

160
00:11:48,642 --> 00:11:51,509
ASK YOUR DAD.

161
00:11:51,511 --> 00:11:52,944

YAPPING ABOUT TAYLOR AND HER

165
00:11:59,419 --> 00:11:59,918
LITTLE BOYFRIEND.

166
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:00,285
>> WHOA.

167
00:12:00,287 --> 00:12:00,652
>> WHOA.

168
00:12:00,654 --> 00:12:01,086
>> BOYFRIEND?

169
00:12:01,088 --> 00:12:02,754
HOLD ON THERE.

170
00:12:02,756 --> 00:12:03,455
NO ONE SAID BOYFRIEND.

171
00:12:03,457 --> 00:12:05,290
LET'S NO JUMP TO CONCLUSIONS

172
00:12:05,292 --> 00:12:05,590

173
00:12:05,592 --> 00:12:06,791
>> YEAH, YEAH.

174
00:12:06,793 --> 00:12:07,826
THEY'RE HANGING OUT.

175
00:12:07,828 --> 00:12:08,760
THEY'RE TAKING THEIR TIME, AND I

176
00:12:08,762 --> 00:12:11,329
THINK THAT'S GREAT.

177
00:12:11,331 --> 00:12:14,332

DISAGREE.

179
00:12:14,701 --> 00:12:16,768
SHE'S IN THE LUXURY BOX HANGING

WITH MAMA KELSEY KNOCKING BACK

181
00:12:19,439 --> 00:12:23,141
COCKTAILS WITH DEADPOOL, FOLKS,

182
00:12:23,143 --> 00:12:23,641
THEY'RE OFFICIAL.

183
00:12:23,643 --> 00:12:26,711
>> HEY, I'M JUST GLAD IT'S NOT

184
00:12:26,713 --> 00:12:27,145
MATTY HEALY.

185
00:12:27,147 --> 00:12:29,681

TRAVIS KELCE, FROM ONE SUPER

189
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:38,256
BOWL CHAMPION TO ANOTHER, THIS

190
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:40,859
IS A WAY BIGGER DEAL THAN THE

191
00:12:40,861 --> 00:12:41,459
SUPER BOWL.

192
00:12:41,461 --> 00:12:43,228
YOU CANNOT MESS THIS UP.

193
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:44,662
THIS IS VERY DELICATE.

194
00:12:44,664 --> 00:12:46,498
>> IT'S SO EARLY.

195
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,233
YOU'RE TREATING IT LIKE IT'S JOE

196
00:12:48,235 --> 00:12:49,334
ALL OVER AGAIN.

197
00:12:49,336 --> 00:12:50,201
THAT WON'T END WELL.

198
00:12:50,203 --> 00:12:51,803
DIDN'T YOU LISTEN TO KARMA?

199
00:12:51,805 --> 00:12:54,139
>> WHAT?

200
00:12:54,141 --> 00:12:54,706
KARMA'S NOT ABOUT JOE.

201
00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:55,573
ARE YOU INSANE?

202
00:12:55,575 --> 00:12:57,709
NOT EVERYTHING HAS TO BE ABOUT

203
00:12:57,711 --> 00:12:58,009
JOE.

204
00:12:58,011 --> 00:13:00,311
>> IT WAS A FORMATIVE

205
00:13:00,313 --> 00:13:00,745
RELATIONSHIP.

206
00:13:00,747 --> 00:13:02,313
>> WE DIDN'T SAY IT WASN'T!

207
00:13:02,315 --> 00:13:03,882
>> ALL RIGHT.

208
00:13:03,884 --> 00:13:04,215
ENOUGH.

209
00:13:04,217 --> 00:13:04,883
LET'S GET TO THE GAME.

210
00:13:04,885 --> 00:13:07,285
THE EAGLES ARE HEAVILY FAVORED,

211
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:09,687
BUT THE JETS HAVE SOME DEFENSIVE

212
00:13:09,689 --> 00:13:11,122
SCHEMES THAT MIGHT SLOW THEM

213
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:11,556
DOWN.

214
00:13:11,558 --> 00:13:13,825
LET'S GO TO OUR NEWEST NFL

215
00:13:13,827 --> 00:13:15,827

TAYLOR IS NOWHERE TO BE SEEN.

222
00:13:24,771 --> 00:13:25,637
>> YOU TOO?

223
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:27,338
WHY WOULD YOU THINK THAT TAYLOR

224
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:30,375
SWIFT WOULD BE AT A JETS/EAGLES

225

GAME?

226
00:13:30,677 --> 00:13:33,144
>> WHAT DO YOU MEAN WHY?

227
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:34,445
BECAUSE THERE WAS A RUMOR ONLINE

228

SHE WAS COMING TO CHEER ON

229

231
00:13:44,124 --> 00:13:47,992
SO FAR, NO SIGN OF BLONDIE.

232
00:13:47,994 --> 00:13:49,694
WONDERING WHY I'M EVEN HERE.

233

LOOK AT TAYLOR'S EYES.

238
00:13:59,573 --> 00:14:00,939
LOOK AT THE THUMBS UP.

00:14:00,941 --> 00:14:03,408

00:44:50,622 --> 00:44:52,655
I HAD THESE VISIONS, COLIN.

977
00:44:52,657 --> 00:44:54,824
A PLACE WHERE THERE WAS WHITE

978
00:44:54,826 --> 00:44:55,158
PEOPLE.

979
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:55,858
LIKE EVERY SINGLE PERSON WAS

980
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:59,228
WHITE.

981
00:44:59,230 --> 00:45:01,931
NOT MANY PEOPLE KNOW THIS, BUT

982
00:45:01,933 --> 00:45:06,068
COLORADO IS AN HWCU, OR

983
00:45:06,070 --> 00:45:07,069
HISTORICALLY WHITE COLLEGE.

984
00:45:07,071 --> 00:45:08,805
KIND OF LIKE WHERE YOU WENT,

985
00:45:08,807 --> 00:45:09,138
COLIN.

986
00:45:09,140 --> 00:45:11,841
>> WELL, I MEAN, HARVARD IS

987
00:45:11,843 --> 00:45:13,276

989
00:45:17,182 --> 00:45:18,114

NOW LOOK AT CHE.

991
00:45:21,219 --> 00:45:23,519
NOW LOOK AT THE AUDIENCE.

992
00:45:23,521 --> 00:45:24,120
NOW LOOK AT MY FINGERS.

00:45:24,122 --> 00:45:26,622
BOOP.

994
00:45:26,624 --> 00:45:27,857
I GOT YOU, MAN.

00:45:27,859 --> 00:45:29,926
I GOT YOU.

996
00:45:29,928 --> 00:45:31,894
COLIN, WE UNSTOPPABLE, MAN.

997
00:45:31,896 --> 00:45:33,329
WE ONLY LOST THREE GAMES.

998
00:45:33,331 --> 00:45:35,231
I CAN'T EVEN THINK OF A TEAM

999
00:45:35,233 --> 00:45:36,466
THAT'S LOST FEWER THAN THAT.

1000
00:45:36,468 --> 00:45:39,202
>> WELL, THERE'S TEXAS.

1001
00:45:39,204 --> 00:45:39,569

1020
00:45:55,453 --> 00:45:57,053
>> YOU CAN STOP NOW.

1021
00:45:57,055 --> 00:45:59,055
COLIN, SOME TEAMS MIGHT HAVE A

1022
00:45:59,057 --> 00:45:59,922
BETTER RECORD.

1023

WE MADE IT TO ARTEMIS 5, AND

1055
00:47:24,092 --> 00:47:25,825
THAT WAS A PRETTY SMOOTH

HYPERDRIVE IF I DO SAY SO

I HAD TO COME IN.

1081
00:48:05,133 --> 00:48:09,368
I USED TO WORK HERE.

1082
00:48:09,370 --> 00:48:10,403
IT'S SO DIFFERENT.

1083

00:48:17,578 --> 00:48:18,978
MAY NOT BE THE BEST TIME.

1088
00:48:18,980 --> 00:48:20,780
>> OH, YOU'RE UNDER ATTACK?

1089
00:48:20,782 --> 00:48:22,148
I KNOW HOW THAT USED TO BE.

1090
00:48:22,150 --> 00:48:23,883
I USED TO WORK HERE.

1091
00:48:23,885 --> 00:48:25,184
I'M MARLEY.

WAIT, THEY MOVED THIS.

1094
00:48:27,755 --> 00:48:30,523
THIS USED TO BE THERE.

1095
00:48:30,525 --> 00:48:32,725
THIS WHOLE THING USED TO BE

1096
00:48:32,727 --> 00:48:33,025
THERE.

1097
00:48:33,027 --> 00:48:35,094
OH, BUT I THINK THIS IS BETTER.

00:48:50,745 --> 00:48:53,045
GUY WITH ALL THE MUSCLES AND NOW

1106
00:48:53,047 --> 00:48:53,479
YOU'RE OLD.

1107
00:48:53,481 --> 00:48:56,749
>> OH, GET OUT OF HERE.

1108
00:48:56,751 --> 00:48:57,149
WE'RE BUSY.

1109

YOU MISSED ME.

1111
00:48:58,753 --> 00:49:00,052

1123
00:49:14,235 --> 00:49:16,769
OR WAS IT KATANA?

1124
00:49:16,771 --> 00:49:17,636
SHE WAS A BIG SLUT.

1125

TOO MUCH ALL THE TIME.

1131
00:49:25,046 --> 00:49:26,712
>> CAPTAIN, I DO NOT KNOW HOW,

DISABLED.

1134
00:49:29,417 --> 00:49:30,082
>> CAN I SIT HERE?

1135
00:49:30,084 --> 00:49:32,518
I USED TO SIT HERE.

1136
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:33,352
OH, MY GOD.

1137
00:49:33,354 --> 00:49:35,154
I WOULD BE HERE AND MY THING WAS

1138
00:49:35,156 --> 00:49:36,956
I WAS IN CHARGE OF LUNCH.

1139
00:49:36,958 --> 00:49:38,591
I WOULD TURN OVER HERE AND SAY

1140
00:49:38,593 --> 00:49:40,526
WHAT DO YOU WANT FOR LUNCH.

1141
00:49:40,528 --> 00:49:41,994
AND THEN I WOULD TURN OVER HERE

1142
00:49:41,996 --> 00:49:44,130
AND SAY, WHAT DO YOU WANT FOR

1143
00:49:44,132 --> 00:49:47,266
LUNCH, AND THAT'S HOW WE WOULD

1144
00:49:47,268 --> 00:49:48,401
FIGURE OUT WHAT WE WERE GOING TO

1145
00:49:48,403 --> 00:49:48,968

1373

1391
00:56:45,619 --> 00:56:48,854
WE GOT TO GET TO THE FARM.

1392

1425
00:57:36,704 --> 00:57:37,903

>> I THINK EVERYONE WANTED TO

1430
00:57:45,145 --> 00:57:46,812
BURY ME, BUT THAT'S NOT THE

1431
00:57:46,814 --> 00:57:47,145
POINT.

1432
00:57:47,147 --> 00:57:47,512
>> NO.

1433
00:57:47,514 --> 00:57:49,281
YOU TOLD EVERYONE TO BURY YOU,

1434
00:57:49,283 --> 00:57:51,383
AND WHEN NO ONE WANTED TO, YOU

1435
00:57:51,385 --> 00:57:51,750

1436
00:57:51,752 --> 00:57:54,386

DO OTHER STUFF, YOU YELLED AT

1440

>> I DON'T REMEMBER THAT.

1442
00:57:59,560 --> 00:58:02,027
IT'S BEEN A TOUGH DAY FOR ALL OF

1443
00:58:02,029 --> 00:58:02,427
US.

1444
00:58:02,429 --> 00:58:03,996
YOU LOST YOUR GRANDMA'S FARM.

1445
00:58:03,998 --> 00:58:06,031
AND I LOST MY WHOLE BEACH DAY

1446

1488
00:59:37,541 --> 00:59:39,207
YOU CAN'T PUT MAKEUP DOWN THERE.

1489
00:59:39,209 --> 00:59:40,575
I'M SORRY.

1492
00:59:45,382 --> 00:59:47,849
CROUCHED OVER A MIRROR LIKE A

NOT TO BE A BITCH, BUT THAT'S

1526
01:00:43,674 --> 01:00:44,106

1527
01:00:44,108 --> 01:00:46,341
>> HEY, I'M NOT DOING THIS FOR

1528
01:00:46,343 --> 01:00:47,109

>> DO NOT PUT WINDEX ON IT!

1546
01:01:15,773 --> 01:01:21,109
IT'S NOT A GLASS COFFEE TABLE,

1547

GEEZ.

1548
