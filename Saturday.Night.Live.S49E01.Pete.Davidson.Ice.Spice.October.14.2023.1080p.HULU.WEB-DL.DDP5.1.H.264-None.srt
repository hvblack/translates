1
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:04,881
>>> THIS WEEK, WE SAW

2
00:00:04,881 --> 00:00:09,904
THE
HORRIBLE IMAGES AND STORIES FROM
ISRAEL AND GAZA,

3
00:00:08,903 --> 00:00:10,923
AND I KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE THINKING,

4
00:00:10,923 --> 00:00:14,343
WHO BETTER TO COMMENT ON IT THAN PETE
DAVIDSON.

5
00:00:14,343 --> 00:00:18,663
WELL, IN A LOT OF WAYS, I AM A
GOOD PERSON TO TALK ABOUT IT

6
00:00:18,663 --> 00:00:22,848
BECAUSE WHEN I WAS 7 YEARS OLD,
MY DAD WAS KILLED IN A TERRORIST
ATTACK.

7
00:00:22,848 --> 00:00:26,253
SO I KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT WHAT
THAT'S LIKE.

8
00:00:26,253 --> 00:00:31,793
I SAW SO MANY TERRIBLE PICTURES
THIS WEEK OF CHILDREN SUFFERING,

9
00:00:31,793 --> 00:00:34,752
ISRAELI CHILDREN AND PALESTINIAN CHILDREN,

10
00:00:34,752 --> 00:00:39,622
AND IT TOOK ME BACK TO
A REALLY HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE PLACE,

11
00:00:39,622 --> 00:00:44,329
AND NO ONE IN THIS WORLD
DESERVES TO SUFFER LIKE THAT,

12
00:00:44,329 --> 00:00:47,254
ESPECIALLY NOT KIDS.

13
00:00:47,316 --> 00:00:52,378
AFTER MY DAD DIED, MY MOM TRIED
PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING

14
00:00:52,378 --> 00:00:53,690
SHE COULD
DO TO CHEER ME UP.

15
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:55,878
I REMEMBER ONE DAY WHEN I WAS 8,

16
00:00:55,878 --> 00:00:58,984
SHE GOT ME WHAT SHE THOUGHT WAS
A DISNEY MOVIE,

17
00:00:58,984 --> 00:01:04,406
BUT IT WAS
ACTUALLY THE EDDIE MURPHY
STANDUP SPECIAL DELIRIOUS.

18
00:01:05,404 --> 00:01:07,896
WE PLAYED IT IN THE CAR ON THE WAY HOME,

19
00:01:07,896 --> 00:01:10,802
AND WHEN SHE HEARD THE
THINGS EDDIE MURPHY WAS SAYING,

20
00:01:10,802 --> 00:01:13,068
SHE TRIED TO TAKE IT AWAY.

21
00:01:13,068 --> 00:01:15,134
BUT THEN SHE NOTICED SOMETHING,

22
00:01:15,134 --> 00:01:19,978
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN A LONG
TIME, I WAS LAUGHING AGAIN.

23
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:23,365
I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT.
I REALLY DON'T, AND I NEVER WILL,

24
00:01:23,365 --> 00:01:28,103
BUT SOMETIMES COMEDY IS
REALLY THE ONLY WAY FORWARD
THROUGH TRAGEDY.

25
00:01:28,103 --> 00:01:33,849
MY HEART IS WITH EVERYONE WHOSE
LIVES HAVE BEEN DESTROYED THIS
WEEK.

26
00:01:33,849 --> 00:01:38,589
BUT TONIGHT, I'M GOING TO DO
WHAT I'VE ALWAYS DONE IN THE FACE OF TRAGEDY,

27
00:01:38,589 --> 00:01:40,989
AND THAT'S TRY
TO BE FUNNY.

28
00:01:40,989 --> 00:01:45,220
REMEMBER, I SAID TRY.

29
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:48,799
AND LIVE FROM NEW YORK, IT'S
SATURDAY NIGHT.

30
00:03:55,294 --> 00:04:00,073
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, PETE
DAVIDSON.

31
00:04:18,098 --> 00:04:21,768
>>> THANK YOU.
IT'S GREAT TO BE BACK.
ALL RIGHT.

32
00:04:21,768 --> 00:04:23,883
ALL RIGHT.
I'M GOING TO GET RIGHT INTO IT.

33
00:04:23,883 --> 00:04:28,310
I AM TRYING TO BOND WITH MY
SISTER.

34
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:30,422
YOU KNOW, I'M ABOUT TO BE 30.

35
00:04:30,422 --> 00:04:32,651
I'M TURNING 30 NEXT MONTH.

36
00:04:33,389 --> 00:04:36,291
IT'S OVER.
YOU KNOW, IT'S OVER.

37
00:04:36,291 --> 00:04:40,901
TRYING TO BOND WITH MY SISTER.
I FEEL LIKE WE SHOULD HAVE A
BETTER RELATIONSHIP.

38
00:04:40,901 --> 00:04:43,594
ME AND MY SISTER HAVE NOTHING IN
COMMON.

39
00:04:43,594 --> 00:04:46,111
SHE ASSISTS BRAIN SURGERY,

40
00:04:46,111 --> 00:04:49,070
AND I'M A DRUG ADDICT.

41
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:51,282
SO NOTHING.

42
00:04:51,282 --> 00:04:55,004
SO I WAS TRYING TO FIND
SOMETHING WE COULD DO SO WE COULD BOND,

43
00:04:55,004 --> 00:04:56,797
 AND I WAS LIKE, WE
SHOULD WATCH A TV SHOW.

44
00:04:56,797 --> 00:04:58,978
THAT'S EASY.
YOU DON'T GOT TO DO ANYTHING.

45
00:04:58,978 --> 00:05:02,384
YOU JUST SIT THERE.
EVERY FIVE MINUTES YOU'RE LIKE,
EH, OH.

46
00:05:03,957 --> 00:05:06,757
I WAS LIKE, WE'LL DO THIS.

47
00:05:06,757 --> 00:05:11,258
ME AND MY SISTER BOTH NEVER SAW
GAME OF THRONES, RIGHT?

48
00:05:11,258 --> 00:05:13,533
I KNOW.

49
00:05:13,533 --> 00:05:15,722
I DIDN'T KNOW.
IT'S THE NUMBER ONE SHOW IN THE
WORLD.

50
00:05:15,722 --> 00:05:18,183
I HAD NO IDEA HOW SICK EVERYONE
IS.

51
00:05:18,183 --> 00:05:21,930
I THOUGHT IT WAS LIKE DRAGONS
AND STUFF, AND MAGIC.

52
00:05:21,983 --> 00:05:23,594
HARDLY ANY DRAGONS.

53
00:05:23,594 --> 00:05:27,615
LOTS OF INCEST, TONS OF INCEST.

54
00:05:27,615 --> 00:05:29,432
SO MUCH INCEST.

55
00:05:29,432 --> 00:05:32,515
YOU CAN LEAVE THE HOUSE, COME
BACK, INCEST STILL HAPPENING.

56
00:05:32,515 --> 00:05:34,537
IT'S A VERY WEIRD SHOW TO WATCH

57
00:05:34,537 --> 00:05:39,014
WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO FIND
COMMON GROUND WITH YOUR SISTER.

58
00:05:39,656 --> 00:05:42,597
I WAS SO UNCOMFORTABLE WATCHING
THIS, GUYS.

59
00:05:42,597 --> 00:05:46,223
I WAS WATCHING, AND I WAS LIKE,
THIS IS SO WEIRD, YOU KNOW.

60
00:05:46,223 --> 00:05:49,680
WONDER HOW SHE FEELS, YOU KNOW.

61
00:05:49,886 --> 00:05:52,393
SO I PUT OUT A FEELER.

62
00:05:52,393 --> 00:05:56,581
I WAS LIKE, HEY, THIS IS PRETTY
WEIRD, HUH?

63
00:05:56,581 --> 00:05:59,863
AND SHE WAS LIKE, I LOVE IT!

64
00:06:04,663 --> 00:06:07,837
I WAS LIKE, YEAH, BUT, YOU KNOW,

65
00:06:07,837 --> 00:06:10,174
THE INCEST, YOU KNOW.

66
00:06:10,174 --> 00:06:13,434
IT'S LIKE A NO-GO, RIGHT?

67
00:06:13,434 --> 00:06:18,599
SHE WAS -- SHE WAS LIKE, WELL,
IT WAS A DIFFERENT TIME.

68
00:06:22,206 --> 00:06:26,107
I WAS LIKE, AM I ABOUT TO BANG
THIS CHICK?
WHAT'S GOING ON.

69
00:06:29,288 --> 00:06:32,432
I PROBABLY WOULDN'T GET HER.
I'M TOO INSECURE.

70
00:06:32,432 --> 00:06:34,615
I'M VERY INSECURE, YOU GUYS.

71
00:06:34,615 --> 00:06:38,664
I THINK IT'S BECAUSE THE HIGH
SCHOOL FOOTBALL COACH USED TO
CALL ME A PUSSY,

72
00:06:38,664 --> 00:06:41,020
 AND I WASN'T
EVEN ON THE TEAM.

73
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:45,028
JUST FIND ME IN CLASS, PUSSY.

74
00:06:47,113 --> 00:06:52,247
I'M A -- YOU GUYS, I'M FROM
STATEN ISLAND, SO THIS IS A BIG
DEAL TO ME.

75
00:06:52,247 --> 00:06:54,328
I GREW UP RIGHT AROUND HERE.

76
00:06:54,328 --> 00:06:57,610
IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT STATEN
ISLAND IS, IT'S THE ONLY ISLAND IN THE WORLD

77
00:06:57,610 --> 00:07:01,439
 WITH A WORSE
REPUTATION THAN EPSTEIN'S
SOMEHOW.

78
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:05,750
BUT IN STATEN ISLAND, THE KIDS
MOLEST THE PRIESTS.

79
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:09,048
EVERYTHING'S BACKWARDS DOWN
THERE.

80
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:14,738
YOU KNOW, A LOT OF PEOPLE ASK
ME -- AND BY THAT, I MEAN TWO --

81
00:07:14,738 --> 00:07:17,952
IS THIS WHAT I WANTED TO DO WHEN I GREW UP, 

82
00:07:17,952 --> 00:07:19,387
AND NO, I AM FROM
STATEN ISLAND.

83
00:07:19,387 --> 00:07:22,320
MY DREAM WAS TO BE A
CONSTRUCTION WORKER.

84
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:27,577
IT WAS.
HOPEFULLY WORK FOR A
CONSTRUCTION COMPANY FOR LIKE EIGHT YEARS,

85
00:07:27,577 --> 00:07:30,581
 AND IF I'M LUCKY,
FALL OFF A LADDER.

86
00:07:30,581 --> 00:07:34,228
SUE THE CITY FOR 6 MIL, SETTLE
FOR 3.

87
00:07:34,228 --> 00:07:38,015
MARRY A CHICK I HAD A CRUSH ON
IN HIGH SCHOOL 

88
00:07:38,015 --> 00:07:42,370
THAT I'M NOT
REALLY INTO ANYMORE, BUT NO ONE
ELSE CAN HAVE HER!

89
00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:48,436
THAT WAS MY DREAM.
I REMEMBER THE FIRST NIGHT I
WENT TO DO A STANDUP SHOW.

90
00:07:48,436 --> 00:07:51,353
I LOVE THIS STORY.
IT'S LIKE MY ORIGIN STORY.

91
00:07:51,353 --> 00:07:54,680
I USED TO HAVE SEX WITH THIS
GIRL IN MY CAR.

92
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:57,298
BECAUSE IN STATEN ISLAND, IT'S
LIKE A CONDO.

93
00:07:57,298 --> 00:08:02,473
SO WE WERE IN MY TWO-BEDROOM
CHEROKEE -- WITH A VIEW.

94
00:08:02,473 --> 00:08:06,038
THIS GIRL WAS AWESOME.
SHE WAS JUST A SEX FRIEND.

95
00:08:06,038 --> 00:08:08,573
IT WAS HER IDEA.
SHE WAS AWESOME.

96
00:08:08,573 --> 00:08:11,516
THEY DON'T MAKE THEM LIKE THAT
ANYMORE, YOU KNOW.

97
00:08:11,516 --> 00:08:14,027
THE GOOD OLE BROADS.

98
00:08:14,027 --> 00:08:19,257
I REMEMBER IT WAS ACTUALLY THE
FIRST NIGHT I EVER HAD A STANDUP SHOW,

99
00:08:19,257 --> 00:08:22,201
 BUT I FORGOT BECAUSE I WAS
HAVING SEX, RIGHT,

100
00:08:22,201 --> 00:08:25,037
 AND I
ACTUALLY DIDN'T REALIZE UNTIL
AFTER I FINISHED.

101
00:08:25,037 --> 00:08:26,311
LIKE IMMEDIATELY AFTER.

102
00:08:26,311 --> 00:08:30,632
I WAS LIKE, AH -- AHH, I'M LATE!

103
00:08:30,632 --> 00:08:33,311
AND EARLY, RELAX.

104
00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:36,415
AND I WAS SO NERVOUS TO TELL
THIS GIRL.

105
00:08:36,415 --> 00:08:39,169
THAT'S SO RUDE.
I DIDN'T WANT TO BE LIKE, WELL,
BYE.

106
00:08:39,169 --> 00:08:41,813
BECAUSE WE WERE SUPPOSED TO GET
PIZZA AFTER.

107
00:08:41,813 --> 00:08:44,479
THAT'S MY GUARANTEE.

108
00:08:44,479 --> 00:08:47,508
DO
GET A SLICE.

109
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:53,609
 I WAS SO NERVOUS TO TELL
HER.

110
00:08:53,609 --> 00:08:58,151
I WAS LIKE, I'M SO SORRY, I
FORGOT I HAVE A SHOW TONIGHT IN
THE CITY.

111
00:08:58,151 --> 00:08:59,879
CAN WE GET PIZZA TOMORROW.

112
00:08:59,879 --> 00:09:02,956
SHE WAS LIKE, OF COURSE.
YOU'RE TRYING TO DO STANDUP?

113
00:09:02,956 --> 00:09:05,580
THAT'S AMAZING.
GO FOR IT.
THAT'S SO COOL.

114
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:08,275
I WAS LIKE, WOW, THANKS.

115
00:09:08,275 --> 00:09:11,626
THEN SHE SAID SOMETHING, YOU
GUYS, THAT I'LL NEVER FORGET.

116
00:09:11,626 --> 00:09:16,317
I STILL THINK ABOUT IT TODAY.
SHE SAID THE COOLEST THING
ANYBODY'S EVER SAID TO ME.

117
00:09:16,317 --> 00:09:18,160
SHE'S PUTTING ON HER SHIRT, AND SHE GOES, 

118
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:23,146
HEY, MAYBE ONE DAY
I'LL BE WATCHING TV WITH MY HUSBAND, 

119
00:09:23,146 --> 00:09:25,473
AND YOU'LL POP ON.

120
00:09:28,839 --> 00:09:34,007
AND THEN I'LL TURN TO MY
HUSBAND, AND I'LL GO, HEY, I
BANGED THAT GUY.

121
00:09:35,818 --> 00:09:41,040
AND I REMEMBER, I WAS LIKE, WHAT
DID YOU READ MY DIARY?
WHO SAYS THAT.

122
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,961
THAT WAS SO COOL.
WHO SAYS THAT.

123
00:09:42,961 --> 00:09:47,309
I REMEMBER BEING ALL HYPED UP
DRIVING TO THE CITY LIKE I'M
GOING TO BE A COMEDIAN.

124
00:09:47,309 --> 00:09:50,659
AND I THINK ABOUT THAT BECAUSE
IT'S VERY SPECIAL.

125
00:09:50,659 --> 00:09:52,789
SHE KIND OF PREDICTED THE
FUTURE.
THAT'S VERY COOL.

126
00:09:52,789 --> 00:09:55,081
I DID GET ON TV.

127
00:09:55,081 --> 00:09:58,682
SHE TRAGICALLY DIED OF AN
OVERDOSE TWO YEARS LATER.

128
00:09:58,682 --> 00:10:01,653
YES, THAT'S VERY SAD.
SHE WAS ONE FOR TWO.

129
00:10:03,616 --> 00:10:06,123
AND I FOUND OUT -- THIS IS
MESSED UP.

130
00:10:06,123 --> 00:10:11,379
I WAS ACTUALLY WATCHING TV WITH
MY GIRLFRIEND, AND SHE POPPED
ON.

131
00:10:15,962 --> 00:10:19,591
AND THEN I TURNED TO MY
GIRLFRIEND, AND I WENT, HEY, 

132
00:10:21,071 --> 00:10:23,193
I
BANGED THAT GIRL.

133
00:10:23,193 --> 00:10:27,616
WE GOT A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU

TAYLOR SWIFT FANS ARE WATCHING,

153
00:11:40,801 --> 00:11:42,400
THE CHIEFS GAME WAS ON THURSDAY.

154
00:11:42,402 --> 00:11:43,435
YOU JUST MISSED HER.

155
00:11:43,437 --> 00:11:44,269

LISTEN, SORRY, SWIFTIES, THIS IS

157
00:11:46,473 --> 00:11:48,206
A SHOW ABOUT FOOTBALL.

158
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:48,640
IT'S A SPORT.

159
00:11:48,642 --> 00:11:51,509
ASK YOUR DAD.

160
00:11:51,511 --> 00:11:52,944

YAPPING ABOUT TAYLOR AND HER

164
00:11:59,419 --> 00:11:59,918
LITTLE BOYFRIEND.

165
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:00,285
>> WHOA.

166
00:12:00,287 --> 00:12:00,652
>> WHOA.

167
00:12:00,654 --> 00:12:01,086
>> BOYFRIEND?

168
00:12:01,088 --> 00:12:02,754
HOLD ON THERE.

169
00:12:02,756 --> 00:12:03,455
NO ONE SAID BOYFRIEND.

170
00:12:03,457 --> 00:12:05,290
LET'S NO JUMP TO CONCLUSIONS

171

172
00:12:05,592 --> 00:12:06,791
>> YEAH, YEAH.

173
00:12:06,793 --> 00:12:07,826
THEY'RE HANGING OUT.

174
00:12:07,828 --> 00:12:08,760
THEY'RE TAKING THEIR TIME, AND I

175
00:12:08,762 --> 00:12:11,329
THINK THAT'S GREAT.

176
00:12:11,331 --> 00:12:14,332

177
00:12:14,334 --> 00:12:14,699
DISAGREE.

178
00:12:14,701 --> 00:12:16,768
SHE'S IN THE LUXURY BOX HANGING

179
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:19,437
WITH MAMA KELSEY KNOCKING BACK

180
00:12:19,439 --> 00:12:23,141
COCKTAILS WITH DEADPOOL, FOLKS,

181
00:12:23,143 --> 00:12:23,641
THEY'RE OFFICIAL.

182
00:12:23,643 --> 00:12:26,711
>> HEY, I'M JUST GLAD IT'S NOT

183
00:12:26,713 --> 00:12:27,145
MATTY HEALY.

184

TRAVIS KELCE, FROM ONE SUPER

188
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:38,256
BOWL CHAMPION TO ANOTHER, THIS

189
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:40,859
IS A WAY BIGGER DEAL THAN THE

190
00:12:40,861 --> 00:12:41,459
SUPER BOWL.

191
00:12:41,461 --> 00:12:43,228
YOU CANNOT MESS THIS UP.

192
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:44,662
THIS IS VERY DELICATE.

193
00:12:44,664 --> 00:12:46,498
>> IT'S SO EARLY.

194
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,233
YOU'RE TREATING IT LIKE IT'S JOE

195
00:12:48,235 --> 00:12:49,334
ALL OVER AGAIN.

196
00:12:49,336 --> 00:12:50,201
THAT WON'T END WELL.

197
00:12:50,203 --> 00:12:51,803
DIDN'T YOU LISTEN TO KARMA?

198
00:12:51,805 --> 00:12:54,139
>> WHAT?

199
00:12:54,141 --> 00:12:54,706
KARMA'S NOT ABOUT JOE.

200
00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:55,573
ARE YOU INSANE?

201
00:12:55,575 --> 00:12:57,709
NOT EVERYTHING HAS TO BE ABOUT

202
00:12:57,711 --> 00:12:58,009
JOE.

203
00:12:58,011 --> 00:13:00,311
>> IT WAS A FORMATIVE

204
00:13:00,313 --> 00:13:00,745
RELATIONSHIP.

205
00:13:00,747 --> 00:13:02,313
>> WE DIDN'T SAY IT WASN'T!

206
00:13:02,315 --> 00:13:03,882
>> ALL RIGHT.

207

ENOUGH.

208
00:13:04,217 --> 00:13:04,883
LET'S GET TO THE GAME.

209
00:13:04,885 --> 00:13:07,285
THE EAGLES ARE HEAVILY FAVORED,

210
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:09,687
BUT THE JETS HAVE SOME DEFENSIVE

211
00:13:09,689 --> 00:13:11,122
SCHEMES THAT MIGHT SLOW THEM

212
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:11,556
DOWN.

213
00:13:11,558 --> 00:13:13,825
LET'S GO TO OUR NEWEST NFL

TAYLOR IS NOWHERE TO BE SEEN.

221

>> YOU TOO?

222
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:27,338
WHY WOULD YOU THINK THAT TAYLOR

223
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:30,375
SWIFT WOULD BE AT A JETS/EAGLES

224

225
00:13:30,677 --> 00:13:33,144
>> WHAT DO YOU MEAN WHY?

226
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:34,445

230
00:13:44,124 --> 00:13:47,992

WONDERING WHY I'M EVEN HERE.

00:13:59,573 --> 00:14:00,939
LOOK AT THE THUMBS UP.

00:42:27,345 --> 00:42:31,047
UPSIDE DOWN.

1001

00:43:08,119 --> 00:43:11,387
>> COLIN, LOOK AT ME, MAN.

1023
00:43:11,389 --> 00:43:12,955
WHAT ABOUT ME MAKES YOU THINK

1024
00:43:12,957 --> 00:43:13,990

1025
00:43:13,992 --> 00:43:14,357

HUH?

1027

TEAM HAS IT ALL, MAN.

1029
00:43:19,798 --> 00:43:21,364
COACHING, GENIUS.

1030
00:43:21,366 --> 00:43:21,931
OFFENSE, EXPLOSIVE.

1031
00:43:21,933 --> 00:43:25,401
DEFENSE, TRYING.

1032
00:43:25,403 --> 00:43:27,270

WELL, MILLIONS OF PEOPLE ARE

1035
00:43:29,341 --> 00:43:30,940
WATCHING YOUR GAMES.

1036
00:43:30,942 --> 00:43:33,409
YOU'VE OBVIOUSLY TURNED THE

1037
00:43:33,411 --> 00:43:34,143
PROGRAM AROUND.

1038
00:43:34,145 --> 00:43:35,178
IT'S NOT PERFECT.

1039
00:43:35,180 --> 00:43:37,146
JUST LAST NIGHT, YOU LOST TO

1040
00:43:37,148 --> 00:43:38,715

1041
00:43:38,717 --> 00:43:41,017
>> WASN'T THAT CRAZY?

1042
00:43:41,019 --> 00:43:42,618
MAN, WE WERE UP 29-0 AT THE

1043
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:42,985
HALF.

1044
00:43:42,987 --> 00:43:45,321
SO I WENT HOME AND FELL ASLEEP.

1045
00:43:45,323 --> 00:43:47,457
I WOKE UP THIS MORNING SHOCKED

1046
00:43:47,459 --> 00:43:47,957
AS ANYONE.

1047
00:43:47,959 --> 00:43:51,027
BUT COME ON, NOBODY'S PERFECT.

1048
00:43:51,029 --> 00:43:52,895
NAME ONE TEAM THAT'S UNDEFEATED.

00:43:55,066 --> 00:43:55,431

THAT'S EXACTLY MY POINT.

1064
00:44:10,782 --> 00:44:11,714
>> WHAT IS YOUR POINT?

1065
00:44:11,716 --> 00:44:14,550
>> COLIN, LOOK AT ME, MAN.

1066
00:44:14,552 --> 00:44:16,753
TO ME, COACHING IS A HIGHER CALL

1067
00:44:16,755 --> 00:44:17,487
ZBLG THAT'S RIGHT.

1068
00:44:17,489 --> 00:44:20,289
YOU STARTED YOUR COACHING CAREER

1069
00:44:20,291 --> 00:44:23,359
AT JACKSON STATE, WHICH IS AN

1070
00:44:23,361 --> 00:44:25,495
HBC OR HISTORICALLY BLACK

1071
00:44:25,497 --> 00:44:25,962
COLLEGE, RIGHT?

1072
00:44:25,964 --> 00:44:27,463
>> VERY GOOD, COLIN.

1073
00:44:27,465 --> 00:44:31,167
THAT'S VERY GOOD.

1074
00:44:31,169 --> 00:44:33,302
YOU KNOW, I TRULY BELIEVE THAT

1075
00:44:33,304 --> 00:44:35,638
GOD CALLED ME THERE, AND HE

1076
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:37,006
SAID, THIS IS YOUR DESTINY.

1077
00:44:37,008 --> 00:44:37,940
>> RIGHT.

1078
00:44:37,942 --> 00:44:39,675
AND THEN THREE YEARS LATER, YOU

1079
00:44:39,677 --> 00:44:41,711
WENT TO CHICAGO -- I MEAN,

1080
00:44:41,713 --> 00:44:42,078
COLORADO.

1081
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:42,812
>> YES.

1082
00:44:42,814 --> 00:44:43,679
YES, THAT'S RIGHT.

1083
00:44:43,681 --> 00:44:45,148
BECAUSE GOD CALLED ME AGAIN AND

1084
00:44:45,150 --> 00:44:47,550
WAS LIKE, MY BAD.

1085
00:44:47,552 --> 00:44:49,185
AND THEN HE SHOWED ME THE

1086
00:44:49,187 --> 00:44:50,620
PROMISE LAND OF COLORADO.

1087
00:44:50,622 --> 00:44:52,655
I HAD THESE VISIONS, COLIN.

1088
00:44:52,657 --> 00:44:54,824
A PLACE WHERE THERE WAS WHITE

1089
00:44:54,826 --> 00:44:55,158
PEOPLE.

1090
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:55,858
LIKE EVERY SINGLE PERSON WAS

1091
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:59,228
WHITE.

1092
00:44:59,230 --> 00:45:01,931
NOT MANY PEOPLE KNOW THIS, BUT

1093
00:45:01,933 --> 00:45:06,068
COLORADO IS AN HWCU, OR

1094
00:45:06,070 --> 00:45:07,069
HISTORICALLY WHITE COLLEGE.

1095
00:45:07,071 --> 00:45:08,805
KIND OF LIKE WHERE YOU WENT,

1096
00:45:08,807 --> 00:45:09,138
COLIN.

1097
00:45:09,140 --> 00:45:11,841
>> WELL, I MEAN, HARVARD IS

1098
00:45:11,843 --> 00:45:13,276
PRETTY DIVERSE, YOU KNOW.

1099
00:45:13,278 --> 00:45:17,180

1103
00:45:23,521 --> 00:45:24,120
NOW LOOK AT MY FINGERS.

00:45:24,122 --> 00:45:26,622
BOOP.

1105
00:45:26,624 --> 00:45:27,857
I GOT YOU, MAN.

1106
00:45:27,859 --> 00:45:29,926
I GOT YOU.

1107
00:45:29,928 --> 00:45:31,894
COLIN, WE UNSTOPPABLE, MAN.

1108
00:45:31,896 --> 00:45:33,329
WE ONLY LOST THREE GAMES.

1109
00:45:33,331 --> 00:45:35,231
I CAN'T EVEN THINK OF A TEAM

1110
00:45:35,233 --> 00:45:36,466
THAT'S LOST FEWER THAN THAT.

1111
00:45:36,468 --> 00:45:39,202

1112

COLIN, SOME TEAMS MIGHT HAVE A

1168
00:47:28,463 --> 00:47:28,794
MYSELF.

1169

STARBOARD.

1172
00:47:36,938 --> 00:47:37,336
>> SHOW ME.

1173
00:47:37,338 --> 00:47:39,005
IF THEY'RE HERE IN ALLIED SPACE,

1174
00:47:39,007 --> 00:47:40,439
THEY'RE LOOKING FOR TROUBLE.

1175
00:47:40,441 --> 00:47:41,240
GIVE US COMES.

1176
00:47:41,242 --> 00:47:44,143
>> I'LL GIVE IT MY ALL, CAPTAIN,

1177
00:47:44,145 --> 00:47:46,112
BUT THEY'VE BLOCKED

1178
00:47:46,114 --> 00:47:46,579
TRANSMISSIONS.

1179
00:47:46,581 --> 00:47:49,248
>> AND THEIR LASER IS LOCKED ON

OUR VESSEL.

1181
00:47:49,884 --> 00:47:51,484

00:47:51,486 --> 00:47:51,817
WEEKEND.

1183
00:47:51,819 --> 00:47:53,386
SHIELD UP, AND LET'S HOPE

1184
00:47:53,388 --> 00:47:54,987
THERE'S NO MORE SURPRISES.

1185
00:47:54,989 --> 00:47:56,022
>> OH, MY GOD.

1186
00:47:56,024 --> 00:47:59,659
THIS IS CRAZY!

1187
00:47:59,661 --> 00:48:00,626
>> EXCUSE ME.

1188
00:48:00,628 --> 00:48:02,762
WHO ARE YOU, AND HOW DID YOU GET

1189
00:48:02,764 --> 00:48:03,195
ON MY BRIDGE.

1190
00:48:03,197 --> 00:48:04,530
>> OH, GOD, I'M SORRY.

1191
00:48:04,532 --> 00:48:05,131
I HAD TO COME IN.

1192
00:48:05,133 --> 00:48:09,368
I USED TO WORK HERE.

1193
00:48:09,370 --> 00:48:10,403
IT'S SO DIFFERENT.

1194
00:48:10,405 --> 00:48:12,538
BUT LIKE TOTALLY THE SAME.

1195
00:48:12,540 --> 00:48:14,473
I'M MARLEY.

1196
00:48:14,475 --> 00:48:16,042
>> MARLEY.

1197
00:48:16,044 --> 00:48:17,576
IT'S NICE TO MEET YOU, BUT THIS

1198
00:48:17,578 --> 00:48:18,978
MAY NOT BE THE BEST TIME.

1199
00:48:18,980 --> 00:48:20,780
>> OH, YOU'RE UNDER ATTACK?

1200
00:48:20,782 --> 00:48:22,148
I KNOW HOW THAT USED TO BE.

1201
00:48:22,150 --> 00:48:23,883
I USED TO WORK HERE.

1202
00:48:23,885 --> 00:48:25,184
I'M MARLEY.

1203
00:48:25,186 --> 00:48:26,285
OH, MY GOD.

1204
00:48:26,287 --> 00:48:27,753
WAIT, THEY MOVED THIS.

1205
00:48:27,755 --> 00:48:30,523
THIS USED TO BE THERE.

1206
00:48:30,525 --> 00:48:32,725
THIS WHOLE THING USED TO BE

1207
00:48:32,727 --> 00:48:33,025
THERE.

1208
00:48:33,027 --> 00:48:35,094
OH, BUT I THINK THIS IS BETTER.

1209
00:48:35,096 --> 00:48:36,495
BETTER FLOW.

1210
00:48:36,497 --> 00:48:38,831
OH, MY GOD, TODD CAMENELLI?

1211
00:48:38,833 --> 00:48:43,302
YOU'RE STILL HERE?

1212
00:48:43,304 --> 00:48:44,170
>> WHAT ABOUT IT?

1213
00:48:44,172 --> 00:48:45,871
>> YOU GOT OLD.

1214
00:48:45,873 --> 00:48:48,607
OH, HOW DID YOU GET SO OLD?

1215
00:48:48,609 --> 00:48:50,743
HE WAS THE HOT YOUNG NAVIGATION

1216
00:48:50,745 --> 00:48:53,045
GUY WITH ALL THE MUSCLES AND NOW

1217
00:48:53,047 --> 00:48:53,479
YOU'RE OLD.

1218
00:48:53,481 --> 00:48:56,749
>> OH, GET OUT OF HERE.

1219
00:48:56,751 --> 00:48:57,149
WE'RE BUSY.

1220
00:48:57,151 --> 00:48:57,883
>> OH, YOU BIG FLIRT.

1221
00:48:57,885 --> 00:48:58,751
YOU MISSED ME.

1222
00:48:58,753 --> 00:49:00,052
>> NO, FALSE.

1223
00:49:00,054 --> 00:49:02,855
>> ENEMY SHIP IS IN ATTACK

1224

RANGE.

1225
00:49:03,191 --> 00:49:04,357
>> PREPARE TO RETURN FIRE.

1226
00:49:04,359 --> 00:49:05,524
>> I'M ON IT, CAPTAIN.

1227
00:49:05,526 --> 00:49:06,359
>> OH, MY GOD.

1228
00:49:06,361 --> 00:49:08,728
THE GIRL THAT USED TO DO YOUR

1229
00:49:08,730 --> 00:49:09,295
JOB.

1230
00:49:09,297 --> 00:49:11,197
WHAT WAS HER NAME AGAIN?

1231
00:49:11,199 --> 00:49:11,864
DINA?

1232
00:49:11,866 --> 00:49:12,298
>> DEBORAH.

1233
00:49:12,300 --> 00:49:14,233
>> I THINK IT WAS DINA.

1234
00:49:14,235 --> 00:49:16,769
OR WAS IT KATANA?

1235
00:49:16,771 --> 00:49:17,636
SHE WAS A BIG SLUT.

1236
00:49:17,638 --> 00:49:20,106
>> THIS VISIT NEEDS TO END,

1237
00:49:20,108 --> 00:49:20,439
MARLEY.

1238
00:49:20,441 --> 00:49:22,408
>> WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM WITH ME,

1239
00:49:22,410 --> 00:49:22,875
YOU OLD GROUCH.

1240
00:49:22,877 --> 00:49:24,443
>> FIVE WORDS.

1241
00:49:24,445 --> 00:49:25,044
TOO MUCH ALL THE TIME.

1242
00:49:25,046 --> 00:49:26,712
>> CAPTAIN, I DO NOT KNOW HOW,

1243
00:49:26,714 --> 00:49:29,048
BUT THE PLASMA ENGINE HAS BEEN

1244
00:49:29,050 --> 00:49:29,415
DISABLED.

1245
00:49:29,417 --> 00:49:30,082
>> CAN I SIT HERE?

1246
00:49:30,084 --> 00:49:32,518
I USED TO SIT HERE.

1247
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:33,352
OH, MY GOD.

1248
00:49:33,354 --> 00:49:35,154
I WOULD BE HERE AND MY THING WAS

1249
00:49:35,156 --> 00:49:36,956
I WAS IN CHARGE OF LUNCH.

1250
00:49:36,958 --> 00:49:38,591
I WOULD TURN OVER HERE AND SAY

1251
00:49:38,593 --> 00:49:40,526
WHAT DO YOU WANT FOR LUNCH.

1252
00:49:40,528 --> 00:49:41,994
AND THEN I WOULD TURN OVER HERE

1253
00:49:41,996 --> 00:49:44,130
AND SAY, WHAT DO YOU WANT FOR

1254
00:49:44,132 --> 00:49:47,266
LUNCH, AND THAT'S HOW WE WOULD

1255
00:49:47,268 --> 00:49:48,401
FIGURE OUT WHAT WE WERE GOING TO

1256
00:49:48,403 --> 00:49:48,968
GET FOR LUNCH.

1257
00:49:48,970 --> 00:49:50,970
I USED TO WORK HERE.

1258
00:49:50,972 --> 00:49:52,338
>> NOBODY CARES, MARLEY.

1259
00:49:52,340 --> 00:49:54,407
>> OH, AND WE ALL HOOKED UP WITH

1260
00:49:54,409 --> 00:49:56,675
EACH OTHER.

1261
00:49:56,677 --> 00:49:57,576

BODY, BAD BODY.

1264
00:50:01,449 --> 00:50:03,349
AND THERE WAS NO GRAVITY SO THE

1265
00:50:03,351 --> 00:50:05,384
GUYS WOULD HELP THE GUYS AND THE

1266
00:50:05,386 --> 00:50:07,219
GIRLS WOULD HELP THE GIRLS.

1267
00:50:07,221 --> 00:50:09,555
>> I NEED THAT PLASMA ENGINE UP!

1268
00:50:09,557 --> 00:50:11,190
>> OH, HE'S GOOD.

1269
00:50:11,192 --> 00:50:12,625
VERY GOOD.

1270
00:50:12,627 --> 00:50:13,159
OUR CAPTAIN DRANK.

1271
00:50:13,161 --> 00:50:14,760
>> HE DID NOT DRINK.

1272
00:50:14,762 --> 00:50:15,895
HE WAS JUST FUNNY.

1273
00:50:15,897 --> 00:50:16,462
>> OKAY.

1274
00:50:16,464 --> 00:50:18,497
HE FUNNIED HIMSELF TO DEATH.

1275
00:50:18,499 --> 00:50:19,064
>> WOW.

1276
00:50:19,066 --> 00:50:20,966
WHO'S FLYING THIS THING?

1277
00:50:20,968 --> 00:50:22,301
>> IMPACT, CAPTAIN.

>> CAPTAIN, THAT IS NOT VIABLE.

1282
00:50:28,242 --> 00:50:30,242
>> WE'LL SEE ABOUT THAT.

1283
00:50:30,244 --> 00:50:32,978
>> CAPTAIN, THAT LAST HIT

1284

DISABLED THE BIG DOORS.

1285
00:50:34,882 --> 00:50:36,949
ONE OF US WILL HAVE TO OPEN THE

1286
00:50:36,951 --> 00:50:37,716
TUBE MANUALLY.

1287
00:50:37,718 --> 00:50:39,051

OH, CALL GNARLY MARLEY.

1295

1503
00:56:48,856 --> 00:56:50,455
AS SOON AS JENNY GETS BACK AND

1504
00:56:50,457 --> 00:56:53,859
TAKES THE PICTURE, WE'LL GO.

1505
00:56:53,861 --> 00:56:54,359
GAH, DUDE.

1506
00:56:54,361 --> 00:56:56,328
I'M SO SORRY THIS HAPPENED TO

1507
00:56:56,330 --> 00:56:56,728
YOU, MAN.

1508
00:56:56,730 --> 00:56:57,863
>> OH, YEAH.

1509
00:56:57,865 --> 00:56:59,298
I THOUGHT MAYBE WE SHOULD GO

1510
00:56:59,300 --> 00:57:00,465
LIKE RIGHT NOW, I MEAN.

1511
00:57:00,467 --> 00:57:03,468
>> DUDE, OF COURSE.

1512
00:57:03,470 --> 00:57:04,937
COME ON, GUYS.

1513
00:57:04,939 --> 00:57:06,405
SERIOUSLY, IT'S TIME TO GO.

1514
00:57:06,407 --> 00:57:08,841
ONCE JENNY GETS BACK AND TAKES

1515
00:57:08,843 --> 00:57:11,476
THE PICTURE, WE'RE GETTING OUT

1516
00:57:11,478 --> 00:57:12,678
OF HERE.

1517
00:57:12,680 --> 00:57:13,111
SUCKS, MAN.

1518
00:57:13,113 --> 00:57:13,812
>> THANKS.

1519
00:57:13,814 --> 00:57:15,681
I'M SAYING I WANT TO GO RIGHT

1520
00:57:15,683 --> 00:57:15,948
NOW.

1521
00:57:15,950 --> 00:57:17,883
I DON'T REALLY WANT TO TAKE THE

1522
00:57:17,885 --> 00:57:18,250
PICTURE.

1523
00:57:18,252 --> 00:57:19,384
>> TOTALLY.

1524
00:57:19,386 --> 00:57:21,386
CHRIS, CAN I SEE YOU DOWN HERE

1525
00:57:21,388 --> 00:57:22,988
FOR A SEC?

1526
00:57:22,990 --> 00:57:23,355
>> YEAH.

1527
00:57:23,357 --> 00:57:25,524
>> HEY, HOW YOU DOING?

1528
00:57:25,526 --> 00:57:26,391
>> REALLY BAD, DUDE.

1529
00:57:26,393 --> 00:57:26,792
>> TOTALLY.

1530
00:57:26,794 --> 00:57:30,229
I GET THAT.

1531
00:57:30,231 --> 00:57:32,297
IT'S JUST, HI TO SPEND ALL DAY

1532
00:57:32,299 --> 00:57:34,132
GETTING BURIED, RIGHT?

1533
00:57:34,134 --> 00:57:34,600
>> YEAH.

1534
00:57:34,602 --> 00:57:35,601
>> BECAUSE EVERYONE REALLY

1535
00:57:35,603 --> 00:57:36,702
WANTED TO BURY ME.

1536
00:57:36,704 --> 00:57:37,903
>> WELL, I DON'T THINK EVERYONE

1537
00:57:37,905 --> 00:57:39,204
WANTED TO BURY YOU.

1538
00:57:39,206 --> 00:57:40,973
YOU WANTED TO GET BURIED,

1539
00:57:40,975 --> 00:57:41,340
REMEMBER?

1540
00:57:41,342 --> 00:57:45,143
>> I THINK EVERYONE WANTED TO

1541
00:57:45,145 --> 00:57:46,812
BURY ME, BUT THAT'S NOT THE

1542
00:57:46,814 --> 00:57:47,145
POINT.

1543
00:57:47,147 --> 00:57:47,512
>> NO.

1544
00:57:47,514 --> 00:57:49,281
YOU TOLD EVERYONE TO BURY YOU,

1545
00:57:49,283 --> 00:57:51,383
AND WHEN NO ONE WANTED TO, YOU

1546
00:57:51,385 --> 00:57:51,750
GOT MAD.

1547
00:57:51,752 --> 00:57:54,386
>> WELL, EVERYONE WANTED TO BURY

1548
00:57:54,388 --> 00:57:54,653
ME.

1549
00:57:54,655 --> 00:57:56,521
>> NO, AND WHEN PEOPLE WANTED TO

1550
00:57:56,523 --> 00:57:58,590
DO OTHER STUFF, YOU YELLED AT

1551
00:57:58,592 --> 00:57:58,891
THEM.

1552
00:57:58,893 --> 00:57:59,558
>> I DON'T REMEMBER THAT.

1553
00:57:59,560 --> 00:58:02,027
IT'S BEEN A TOUGH DAY FOR ALL OF

1554
00:58:02,029 --> 00:58:02,427
US.

1555
00:58:02,429 --> 00:58:03,996
YOU LOST YOUR GRANDMA'S FARM.

1556
00:58:03,998 --> 00:58:06,031
AND I LOST MY WHOLE BEACH DAY

1557
00:58:06,033 --> 00:58:07,799
GETTING BURIED AND MIGHT NOT

1558
00:58:07,801 --> 00:58:10,035
EVEN GET A PICTURE.

1559
00:58:10,037 --> 00:58:12,905
>> THAT'S NOT THE SAME THING,

1560
00:58:12,907 --> 00:58:13,205
BRO.

1561
00:58:13,207 --> 00:58:13,839
>> LET'S SNAP THIS THING.

1562
00:58:13,841 --> 00:58:14,306
>> LET'S DO IT!

1563
00:58:14,308 --> 00:58:17,409
>> JENNY, I JUST FOUND OUT MY

1564
00:58:17,411 --> 00:58:20,012
GRANDMA'S BEAN FARM JUST GOT

1565
00:58:20,014 --> 00:58:21,280
COMPLETELY SUCKED INTO THE SKY.

1566
00:58:21,282 --> 00:58:22,581
>> CHRIS, I'M SO SORRY.

1567
00:58:22,583 --> 00:58:23,615
>> YEAH.

1568
00:58:23,617 --> 00:58:24,650
JENNY, TODAY REALLY SHOWED ME

1569
00:58:24,652 --> 00:58:26,285
THAT LIFE'S UNCERTAIN, YOU KNOW.

1570
00:58:26,287 --> 00:58:29,021
BUT I KNOW WHAT I WANT.

1571
00:58:29,023 --> 00:58:32,491
>> I THINK I WANT THE SAME

1572
00:58:32,493 --> 00:58:32,791
THING.

1573
00:58:32,793 --> 00:58:37,129
>> KISS HER!

1574
00:58:37,131 --> 00:58:37,629
>> KISS!

1575
00:58:37,631 --> 00:58:38,897
>> YEA!

1576
00:58:38,899 --> 00:58:40,565
>> I FEEL LIKE WE COULD HAVE

1577
00:58:40,567 --> 00:58:56,865
TAKEN THE PICTURE BY NOW, RIGHT?

1578
00:58:56,867 --> 00:58:59,067
>>> THANKS FOR SEEING ME ON SUCH

1579
00:58:59,069 --> 00:58:59,668
SHORT NOTICE.

1580
00:58:59,670 --> 00:59:02,471
I KNOW YOU HAVE A REALLY BUSY

1581
00:59:02,473 --> 00:59:04,539
SCHEDULE, BUT ME THINKS I KNOW

1582
00:59:04,541 --> 00:59:08,810
WHY, CUTEST GEINO IN TOWN.

1583
00:59:08,812 --> 00:59:10,278
>> IF ANYONE REPORTS

1584
00:59:10,280 --> 00:59:13,348
INFLAMMATION FOR THAT LONG, I

1585
00:59:13,350 --> 00:59:13,782
GET CONCERNED.

1586
00:59:13,784 --> 00:59:14,182
ALL RIGHT.

1587
00:59:14,184 --> 00:59:15,651
LET'S TAKE A LOOK.

1588
00:59:15,653 --> 00:59:15,951
WHOA!

1589
00:59:15,953 --> 00:59:17,653
>> YES, DOCTOR?

1590
00:59:17,655 --> 00:59:18,854
SEE SOMETHING YOU LIKE?

1591
00:59:18,856 --> 00:59:22,257
>> NO, DUDE.

1592
00:59:22,259 --> 00:59:23,492
IT'S JUST -- DID YOU -- DID YOU

1593
00:59:23,494 --> 00:59:26,261
PUT MAKEUP ON IT?

1594
00:59:26,263 --> 00:59:29,731
>> WELL, NOT JUST ANY OLD

1595
00:59:29,733 --> 00:59:30,799
MAKEUP, DOC.

1596
00:59:30,801 --> 00:59:33,635
I USED GLAMGINA.

1597
00:59:33,637 --> 00:59:36,004
MAKEUP FOR YOUR OTHER FACE.

1598
00:59:36,006 --> 00:59:37,539
>> NO, NO, NO.

1599
00:59:37,541 --> 00:59:39,207
YOU CAN'T PUT MAKEUP DOWN THERE.

1600
00:59:39,209 --> 00:59:40,575
I'M SORRY.

1601
00:59:40,577 --> 00:59:43,712
DID YOU GIVE IT A SMOKY EYE?

1602
00:59:43,714 --> 00:59:45,380
>> I SURE DID.

1603
00:59:45,382 --> 00:59:47,849
CROUCHED OVER A MIRROR LIKE A

1604
00:59:47,851 --> 00:59:48,216
FROG.

1605
00:59:48,218 --> 00:59:50,786
>> THAT'S THE ONLY WAY TO DO IT.

1606
00:59:50,788 --> 00:59:52,888
>> HEY, YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO

1607
00:59:52,890 --> 00:59:53,321
BE IN HERE.

1608
00:59:53,323 --> 00:59:56,625
>> THANKS TO GLAMGINA, NOW MY

1609
00:59:56,627 --> 00:59:58,894
SNATCH LOOKS SNATCHED.

1610
00:59:58,896 --> 01:00:00,662
>> THAT'S THE MAGIC OF GLAMGINA.

1611
01:00:00,664 --> 01:00:04,132
>> WHERE ARE YOU GUYS COMING

1612
01:00:04,134 --> 01:00:04,433
FROM?

1613
01:00:04,435 --> 01:00:06,635
>> THE PARKING LOT.

1614
01:00:06,637 --> 01:00:09,171
>> LIP PLUMPING GLOSS.

1615
01:00:09,173 --> 01:00:12,407
SIDE EFFECTS MAY INCLUDE VAGINAL

1616
01:00:12,409 --> 01:00:12,774
MIGRATION?

1617
01:00:12,776 --> 01:00:13,642
MIGRATING WHERE?

1618
01:00:13,644 --> 01:00:15,444
>> MAYBE NOW I'LL BE ABLE TO

1619
01:00:15,446 --> 01:00:18,046
SCORE A DATE WITH THAT CUTE

1620
01:00:18,048 --> 01:00:18,380
DOCTOR.

1621
01:00:18,382 --> 01:00:19,948
>> I DO NOT WANT TO DATE YOU.

1622
01:00:19,950 --> 01:00:20,782
I'M MARRIED.

1623
01:00:20,784 --> 01:00:24,720
>> SAYS THE GUY STARING AT HER

1624
01:00:24,722 --> 01:00:25,053
VAGINA.

1625
01:00:25,055 --> 01:00:26,188
>> WHAT'S WRONG, DOC?

1626
01:00:26,190 --> 01:00:28,190
IS IT MY HAIR DOWN THERE?

1627
01:00:28,192 --> 01:00:29,124
BECAUSE WE'VE GOT A PRODUCT FOR

1628
01:00:29,126 --> 01:00:29,491
THAT TOO.

1629
01:00:29,493 --> 01:00:31,827
>> YEAH, I COULD TELL.

1630
01:00:31,829 --> 01:00:33,628
>> HOLD ON A MINUTE, LADIES.

1631
01:00:33,630 --> 01:00:36,231
>> HOW DID YOU GET DOWN THERE?

1632
01:00:36,233 --> 01:00:37,265
>> THE WINDOW.

1633
01:00:37,267 --> 01:00:39,167
SO YOU'RE PUTTING MAKEUP ON IT

1634
01:00:39,169 --> 01:00:40,969
JUST TO SCORE A DATE WITH YOUR

1635
01:00:40,971 --> 01:00:41,703
CUTE DOCTOR?

1636
01:00:41,705 --> 01:00:43,672
NOT TO BE A BITCH, BUT THAT'S

1637
01:00:43,674 --> 01:00:44,106
NOT FEMINIST.

1638
01:00:44,108 --> 01:00:46,341
>> HEY, I'M NOT DOING THIS FOR

1639
01:00:46,343 --> 01:00:47,109
ANYONE ELSE.

1640
01:00:47,111 --> 01:00:48,844
I'M DOING IT FOR ME BECAUSE WHEN

1641
01:00:48,846 --> 01:00:51,346
I TAKE A PICTURE OF IT WITH THE

1642
01:00:51,348 --> 01:00:52,547
FLASH ON, I WANT SOMETHING THAT

1643
01:00:52,549 --> 01:00:54,082
I WOULD BE PROUD TO SHOW MY

1644
01:00:54,084 --> 01:00:54,416
FAMILY.

1645
01:00:54,418 --> 01:00:54,850
>> ALL RIGHT.

1646
01:00:54,852 --> 01:00:55,584
YOU KNOW WHAT?

1647
01:00:55,586 --> 01:00:59,788
I'M JUST GOING TO GIVE YOU AN

1648
01:00:59,790 --> 01:01:00,522
ANTIBIOTIC SHOT.

1649
01:01:00,524 --> 01:01:01,356
>> HI!

1650
01:01:01,358 --> 01:01:04,059
>> HEY, JANESSA!

1651
01:01:04,061 --> 01:01:07,262
>> I HAVE TO KNOW, IS GLAMGINA

1652
01:01:07,264 --> 01:01:08,263
HARD TO WASH OFF?

1653
01:01:08,265 --> 01:01:10,232
>> NOT AT ALL.

1654
01:01:10,234 --> 01:01:13,168
JUST SPRAY SOME WINDEX ON IT AND

1655
01:01:13,170 --> 01:01:13,568
GO TO TOWN.

1656
01:01:13,570 --> 01:01:15,771
>> DO NOT PUT WINDEX ON IT!

1657
01:01:15,773 --> 01:01:21,109
IT'S NOT A GLASS COFFEE TABLE,

1658
01:01:21,111 --> 01:01:21,409
GEEZ.

1659
01:01:21,411 --> 01:01:21,877
>> I DON'T KNOW.

1660
01:01:21,879 --> 01:01:23,311
IT CHECKS OUT TO ME.

1661
01:01:23,313 --> 01:01:25,647
I USE MAKEUP ON MY FACE.

1662
01:01:25,649 --> 01:01:28,049
WHY NOT USE MAKEUP ON MY CHOO

1663
01:01:28,051 --> 01:01:28,416
CHOO?

1664
01:01:28,418 --> 01:01:30,118
ALMOST THE SAME AMOUNT OF PEOPLE

1665
01:01:30,120 --> 01:01:30,552
SEE IT.

1666
01:01:30,554 --> 01:01:32,454
>> THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I SAID.

1667
01:01:32,456 --> 01:01:32,888
>> TOTALLY.

1668
01:01:32,890 --> 01:01:34,456
>> I GOT A QUESTION.

1669
01:01:34,458 --> 01:01:34,956
