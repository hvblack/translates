1
00:00:01,856 --> 00:00:05,555
<i>Cheers is filmed
before a live studio audience.</i>

2
00:00:05,555 --> 00:00:07,544
No, no, it's
a well-documented fact

3
00:00:07,579 --> 00:00:11,691
that the female of the species
is irresistibly drawn
to men in uniform.

4
00:00:11,691 --> 00:00:14,384
Yeah, just yesterday, some
lonely, frustrated housewife

5
00:00:14,384 --> 00:00:17,419
saw me coming
up the garden path,
you know, peeking
through the window,

6
00:00:17,419 --> 00:00:22,396
and she tries
to coyly titillate me
by pulling down the shade
so I wonder what's
going on behind it.

7
00:00:22,396 --> 00:00:26,134
Let me dispel the mystery.
She was puking.

8
00:00:26,134 --> 00:00:29,566
Carla,
don't you get bored just
hanging around here all day

9
00:00:29,566 --> 00:00:31,401
waiting to take
cheap shots at me?

10
00:00:31,435 --> 00:00:33,769
Yeah, I should get a beeper.

11
00:00:33,922 --> 00:00:36,223
All right, look. That's it.

12
00:00:36,257 --> 00:00:38,758
I am sick and tired
of being your whipping boy.

13
00:00:38,793 --> 00:00:40,393
Today the worm turns.

14
00:00:40,427 --> 00:00:44,097
You are not going to insult me
any longer,
because I am not going
to give you the chance.

15
00:00:44,132 --> 00:00:47,363
As of from right now,
I am shutting up,
zipping my lip.

16
00:00:51,372 --> 00:00:53,690
And my friends support me.

17
00:01:00,047 --> 00:01:02,565
¶ Making your way
in the world today ¶

18
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:05,518
¶ Takes everything you've got.

19
00:01:05,552 --> 00:01:08,305
¶ Taking a break
from all your worries ¶

20
00:01:08,289 --> 00:01:11,507
¶ Sure would help a lot.

21
00:01:11,542 --> 00:01:15,698
¶ Wouldn't you like
to get away? ¶

22
00:01:17,012 --> 00:01:19,566
¶ Sometimes you want to go.

23
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:24,038
¶ Where everybody
knows your name ¶

24
00:01:24,572 --> 00:01:29,119
¶ And they're always glad
you came ¶

25
00:01:29,311 --> 00:01:31,854
¶ You want to be
where you can see ¶

26
00:01:31,854 --> 00:01:34,581
¶ Our troubles
are all the same ¶

27
00:01:34,616 --> 00:01:39,553
¶ You want to be where everybody
knows your name ¶

28
00:01:39,587 --> 00:01:42,438
¶ You want to go
where people know ¶

29
00:01:42,473 --> 00:01:44,825
¶ People are all the same.

30
00:01:44,859 --> 00:01:49,949
¶ You want to go where
everybody knows your name. ¶

31
00:02:04,158 --> 00:02:06,538
You know something, chaps,

32
00:02:06,563 --> 00:02:10,698
I had a particularly fascinating
session this morning.

33
00:02:13,203 --> 00:02:15,298
No, honestly.

34
00:02:18,246 --> 00:02:20,386
Someone I was seeing
for the first time.

35
00:02:20,411 --> 00:02:22,846
Extraordinarily beautiful,
young woman,

36
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:28,501
who's uh, rather unique malaise
is to be aroused
with sexual frenzy by...

37
00:02:28,535 --> 00:02:30,098
Oh, good Lord.

38
00:02:30,098 --> 00:02:34,373
Excuse me. I don't really think
I should be discussing
my patients here.

39
00:02:38,896 --> 00:02:43,827
Uh... how about
discussing them over here?

40
00:02:44,268 --> 00:02:48,840
Well,
I suppose it wouldn't violate
any doctor-patient
confidentiality

41
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,692
if I don't use names.

42
00:02:50,692 --> 00:02:52,025
Pour the beer, Woody.

43
00:02:52,059 --> 00:02:54,643
I thought you weren't going
to use any names, Dr. Crane.

44
00:02:54,643 --> 00:02:55,717
Woody...

45
00:02:55,717 --> 00:03:01,317
Well, it seems this woman
has her passions inflamed
by men who dance.

46
00:03:01,352 --> 00:03:04,399
Wait a minute, Wait a minute.
Men who dance?

47
00:03:04,399 --> 00:03:05,376
That's weird.

48
00:03:05,376 --> 00:03:06,857
What's even more bizarre,

49
00:03:06,891 --> 00:03:09,585
is that she will catapult
herself compulsively

50
00:03:09,585 --> 00:03:13,597
into the arms of any man
in tights or tap shoes.

51
00:03:13,631 --> 00:03:15,651
Fascinating fixation.

52
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:19,152
Ooh, geez. I've got
to go. I'm sorry.

53
00:03:19,186 --> 00:03:22,378
Where you going?
My ballet class.

54
00:03:22,756 --> 00:03:25,016
No, no,
lunch, lunch.

55
00:03:25,016 --> 00:03:26,359
That was a little psychological
humor.

56
00:03:26,394 --> 00:03:28,218
You know, as my old
professor used to say,

57
00:03:28,218 --> 00:03:31,417
if you can't laugh
at your patients,
what fun are they?

58
00:03:32,816 --> 00:03:34,243
See you later.

59
00:03:34,243 --> 00:03:35,220
Norm.

60
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:38,340
- Morning, everybody.
- Norm!

61
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:40,823
Can I pour you a draft,
Mr. Peterson?

62
00:03:40,858 --> 00:03:42,238
A little early, isn't it, Woody?

63
00:03:42,259 --> 00:03:45,628
- For a beer?
- No, for stupid questions.

64
00:03:45,663 --> 00:03:47,764
Pour.

65
00:03:47,798 --> 00:03:50,033
Would you believe the board
of directors is asking

66
00:03:50,068 --> 00:03:54,373
for a breakdown
of projected earnings
for the next six months?

67
00:03:54,939 --> 00:03:56,772
Yes.

68
00:03:57,524 --> 00:04:00,228
Rebecca,
I started painting
Mr. Drake's house.

69
00:04:00,228 --> 00:04:01,894
I want to thank you
for that recommendation.

70
00:04:01,929 --> 00:04:04,064
Oh, it was my pleasure, Norm.
How's it going?

71
00:04:04,098 --> 00:04:06,783
Great, great.
He's out of town for a few days
so, uh,

72
00:04:06,817 --> 00:04:09,435
I thought it'd be a good time
to get started in his bedroom.

73
00:04:09,369 --> 00:04:11,138
I was doing a little prep
work over there this morning,

74
00:04:11,172 --> 00:04:12,839
and I must say, that's
a cute photo of you

75
00:04:12,873 --> 00:04:14,608
he has next
to his night stand there.

76
00:04:14,608 --> 00:04:17,402
- What?
- Just kidding.

77
00:04:19,164 --> 00:04:21,131
I will kill you, Norm.

78
00:04:21,165 --> 00:04:23,950
You know, uh,
I am over there all by myself,

79
00:04:23,984 --> 00:04:26,953
so if you want
to drop by and, uh,
check any of the house out,

80
00:04:26,987 --> 00:04:28,655
I can get you in.

81
00:04:28,689 --> 00:04:31,290
No... I can't.

82
00:04:31,325 --> 00:04:35,043
Oh, go on.
You're dying to look
in his drawers.

83
00:04:36,042 --> 00:04:38,983
That's right, he won't be there.

84
00:04:40,317 --> 00:04:43,936
The last thing on my mind
is Evan Drake
and where he sleeps.

85
00:04:43,971 --> 00:04:45,486
No, I don't want
to be distracted.

86
00:04:45,486 --> 00:04:47,891
I've got to get these figures
into the bed of directors...

87
00:04:47,925 --> 00:04:50,276
board of directors.

88
00:04:50,978 --> 00:04:54,815
- Shall we say in one hour?
- I'll be there.

89
00:04:58,619 --> 00:05:00,903
Excuse me,
I'm looking for Dr. Crane.

90
00:05:00,938 --> 00:05:02,272
He mentioned he'd be here.

91
00:05:02,306 --> 00:05:03,793
Oh, I'm sorry,
you just missed him.

92
00:05:03,793 --> 00:05:06,865
Oh, darn.
I had a session earlier today

93
00:05:06,865 --> 00:05:10,064
and left a package
in his office.
When I went back, it was locked.

94
00:05:10,098 --> 00:05:11,598
Gee, I don't know
what to tell you.

95
00:05:11,632 --> 00:05:14,555
But then again, I don't know
what to tell most people.

96
00:05:15,143 --> 00:05:18,369
Uh, excuse me.
Uh, you had a session with him?

97
00:05:18,369 --> 00:05:19,822
Are you a patient of his?

98
00:05:19,856 --> 00:05:23,334
- That's right. Why?
- Oh, just curious.

99
00:05:29,336 --> 00:05:32,036
Well, it's not that important.

100
00:05:32,036 --> 00:05:34,414
I just thought if I caught him,
I could still
get my package back.

101
00:05:34,414 --> 00:05:36,345
I understand perfectly.

102
00:05:41,859 --> 00:05:46,394
Well, I'm out of luck, I guess.
I'll just have
to stop by tomorrow.

103
00:05:48,736 --> 00:05:52,555
¶ Gotta dance, gotta dance... ¶

104
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:55,915
- Why are you doing that?
- This? Oh...

105
00:05:56,678 --> 00:06:00,446
I guess it's kind of an
old reflex with us hoofers.

106
00:06:00,481 --> 00:06:03,995
Oh. You're a dancer?
Well, kind of.

107
00:06:03,995 --> 00:06:05,907
Yeah... my name's Sam Malone

108
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:08,372
but people call me Bojangles.

109
00:06:08,372 --> 00:06:11,274
- Jennifer McCall.
- Jennifer McCall, whoo...

110
00:06:11,309 --> 00:06:14,610
That's a beautiful name
for a beautiful girl.

111
00:06:14,645 --> 00:06:16,345
Well, thank you.
I have to be going.

112
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:20,774
Well, at least let me,
uh, waltz you
to the door here, all right?

113
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:23,703
I know I'm not
very sophisticated,

114
00:06:23,703 --> 00:06:25,955
but I don't think
what Sam is doing is right.

115
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:28,976
Well, look,
don't you put yourself
down with me,

116
00:06:28,976 --> 00:06:30,427
and I happen to agree with you.

117
00:06:30,461 --> 00:06:32,740
I mean, standing around
tending bar all day

118
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:36,236
is like the worst thing
a dancer could do
for his calves.

119
00:06:38,435 --> 00:06:41,471
Speaking of calves, Woody,

120
00:06:41,505 --> 00:06:44,946
was it painful when the cow
kicked you in the head?

121
00:06:45,234 --> 00:06:47,718
You get used to it.

122
00:06:48,495 --> 00:06:51,330
Why don't I stop back
and um, we'll go to lunch.

123
00:06:51,365 --> 00:06:53,725
Oh, I'm looking forward to it
already.

124
00:06:56,569 --> 00:06:59,122
Ow, got a cramp. Oh, God...

125
00:06:59,156 --> 00:07:00,829
Ow, Woody...

126
00:07:02,626 --> 00:07:05,928
And, uh, here's his bedroom.

127
00:07:11,072 --> 00:07:13,987
I feel kind of queasy.

128
00:07:14,021 --> 00:07:17,123
Like I don't belong here.
Like I'm doing something wrong.

129
00:07:17,157 --> 00:07:19,481
I know... that's how I feel
in my bedroom.

130
00:07:22,663 --> 00:07:25,665
I just feel kind of like
I'm trespassing.

131
00:07:25,699 --> 00:07:29,175
Like I'm invading his privacy.

132
00:07:31,505 --> 00:07:33,639
This is not right.

133
00:07:37,795 --> 00:07:41,413
This is not right.
I should not be doing this.

134
00:07:41,749 --> 00:07:47,305
I shouldn't.
I shouldn't, I shouldn't.

135
00:07:48,855 --> 00:07:51,590
Would you like to be alone?

136
00:07:52,759 --> 00:07:54,827
Sorry.

137
00:07:55,932 --> 00:07:59,766
Well, as long as I'm here,
I guess it wouldn't hurt for me
to just look around
a little bit.

138
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:02,669
Sure.
Now, I suggested Navajo white,

139
00:08:02,703 --> 00:08:05,372
but he went with sandstone.
What do you think?

140
00:08:05,406 --> 00:08:08,296
This is where he keeps
his clothes, isn't it?

141
00:08:08,509 --> 00:08:10,443
Do you think anybody heard that?

142
00:08:10,477 --> 00:08:13,291
- Like who?
- I don't know. I'm just nervous.

143
00:08:13,291 --> 00:08:15,565
God, there's no way I could
explain it if I got caught.

144
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:16,799
How are you going to get caught?

145
00:08:16,833 --> 00:08:20,130
Because people always get caught
in this situation.

146
00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:23,870
- What if Evan comes back
unexpectedly.
- Look, he's in Europe, okay?

147
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:26,108
You don't come back
unexpectedly from Europe.

148
00:08:26,143 --> 00:08:29,399
You come back unexpectedly
from the movies or shopping.

149
00:08:29,399 --> 00:08:32,056
But you don't come back
unexpect...

150
00:08:32,316 --> 00:08:34,200
What? What?

151
00:08:34,234 --> 00:08:37,757
Oh, my God, it's Mr. Drake!
He's back unexpectedly
from Europe!

152
00:08:38,322 --> 00:08:40,271
Oh, I have to get out of here.

153
00:08:40,271 --> 00:08:43,776
Norm, are you here?
- Uh, yes, sir.
Be right down, sir.

154
00:08:43,810 --> 00:08:45,278
No, that's all right,
I'm coming up.

155
00:08:45,312 --> 00:08:47,947
For the love of...
Go, go, go, go, go.

156
00:08:51,051 --> 00:08:54,137
Norm...
- Oh, oh, right, right.
- Okay.

157
00:08:55,706 --> 00:08:59,608
- Ah, Norm... there you are.
- Hi, sir.

158
00:08:59,643 --> 00:09:01,144
What are you doing here, sir?

159
00:09:01,178 --> 00:09:05,414
Oh, I wound up everything
in a marathon session.
I haven't slept for three days.

160
00:09:05,449 --> 00:09:09,633
Three days.
Let me take you out
for a cup of coffee, sir.

161
00:09:10,021 --> 00:09:13,155
No, no, no.
All I want to do is
sleep for about a week.

162
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:14,758
Should I get your pajamas, sir?

163
00:09:14,792 --> 00:09:15,985
No!

164
00:09:16,109 --> 00:09:19,200
- No?
- No.

165
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,298
<i>Oh, I thought you meant
my pajamas.</i>

166
00:09:22,766 --> 00:09:25,785
No, they're, uh, they're
too far away from here

167
00:09:25,819 --> 00:09:28,566
and I don't even think
they'd fit Mr. Drake.

168
00:09:28,808 --> 00:09:33,588
Actually, I think you'll find
a clean pair of pajamas
in the bag.

169
00:09:35,238 --> 00:09:37,017
I thought you were
going to fix that.

170
00:09:37,017 --> 00:09:39,248
Oh, yeah, that squeak.
I'm going to fix that squeak,
sir.

171
00:09:39,282 --> 00:09:42,555
You should go to another room.
I may need to use
the jaws of life.

172
00:09:42,555 --> 00:09:44,960
Uh, no, just leave it, will ya?

173
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:47,657
As a matter of fact, forget
the painting thing, too.

174
00:09:47,657 --> 00:09:50,576
I'm a light sleeper,
and I don't want to hear you
rattling your paint cans.

175
00:09:50,611 --> 00:09:53,513
Well, that's one thing
I've never been accused of, sir,
is rattling my cans.

176
00:09:53,546 --> 00:09:56,413
Please, I mean it, Norm. Scoot.

177
00:09:57,951 --> 00:10:01,286
- Huh?
- Yes, sir.

178
00:10:04,158 --> 00:10:06,976
So you're a really light
sleeper, sir?

179
00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:10,190
Yes, but I have
excellent hearing, Norm.

180
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:15,572
Yeah, most light sleepers do.
That's what makes them
light sleepers.

181
00:10:26,013 --> 00:10:28,382
So you just left her
in the closet?

182
00:10:28,382 --> 00:10:32,574
Believe me, I did
everything I could
to get the guy out of the room
for like one minute,

183
00:10:32,574 --> 00:10:34,277
but he wouldn't budge.

184
00:10:34,705 --> 00:10:37,729
So you just left her
in the closet?

185
00:10:37,942 --> 00:10:41,517
There was nothing else
I could do, okay?

186
00:10:41,962 --> 00:10:45,264
So you just
left her in the closet?

187
00:10:45,264 --> 00:10:48,584
Carla, it wasn't
my fault, all right?

188
00:10:49,053 --> 00:10:53,106
It's been at least an hour.
She should have
snuck out by now.

189
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:55,950
Oh, come on.
She'd be here
if she'd gotten away.

190
00:10:55,950 --> 00:10:57,360
You gotta get her out of there.

191
00:10:57,394 --> 00:11:00,730
Hey, look.
You, uh, you think of it
as an adventure.

192
00:11:00,765 --> 00:11:02,749
She's the damsel in distress

193
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:07,403
and you are the knight
in shiny white armor,
leaping upon your steed.

194
00:11:07,437 --> 00:11:10,990
And driving it into the ground
up to its knees.

195
00:11:11,759 --> 00:11:15,461
No, no, no, no, and
saving a damsel.

196
00:11:16,763 --> 00:11:20,582
I guess you're right,
you're right.
I gotta go do this.

197
00:11:20,617 --> 00:11:23,674
Listen, uh, Cliffie,
if I'm not back in an hour,

198
00:11:23,674 --> 00:11:25,338
go ahead and finish my beer.

199
00:11:25,372 --> 00:11:27,277
This is your beer.

200
00:11:28,875 --> 00:11:32,027
Sammy, I hear you got
a sure thing lined up, huh?

201
00:11:32,061 --> 00:11:34,760
Mm, no, I never like
to use the term "sure thing."

202
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:37,677
I prefer the term "in the bag."

203
00:11:39,053 --> 00:11:40,288
What? What?

204
00:11:40,288 --> 00:11:42,237
Ah, Sammy, come on.
Isn't this, you know,

205
00:11:42,272 --> 00:11:45,703
pretending to be a phony-bologna
dancer a little bit beneath you?

206
00:11:45,703 --> 00:11:48,645
I mean,
when I go picking up girls,
I don't need all that stuff.

207
00:11:48,679 --> 00:11:50,309
All I need is a wink
and a smile.

208
00:11:50,331 --> 00:11:53,224
And a rag doused
with chloroform.

209
00:11:55,135 --> 00:11:58,654
I don't know, Sammy.
It looks to me like you're
getting a little desperate.

210
00:11:58,689 --> 00:12:00,456
What are you talk...
I'm not desperate.

211
00:12:00,491 --> 00:12:02,625
I don't know what
you're talking about.

212
00:12:03,113 --> 00:12:04,827
Ready, Sam?

213
00:12:04,862 --> 00:12:07,029
Oh, hi, Jennifer.
I'll be right with you.

214
00:12:07,063 --> 00:12:08,874
See you guys later.

215
00:12:13,937 --> 00:12:16,219
Ready to go? Mm-hmm.

216
00:12:38,061 --> 00:12:40,964
Mr. Drake!
Mr. Drake, sir!

217
00:12:40,998 --> 00:12:43,700
Sorry, sir, but Mr. Peterson
said it was an emergency.

218
00:12:43,735 --> 00:12:45,035
What? Emergency?

219
00:12:45,069 --> 00:12:48,655
Yeah, structural, Evan.
It's just a damn good thing
I went back
and checked those blueprints.

220
00:12:48,690 --> 00:12:51,027
This ceiling could go
at any second.
- Ceiling?

221
00:12:51,027 --> 00:12:55,528
Yeah, it's a crack, sir.
It extends all the way
into, uh, here.

222
00:12:55,562 --> 00:12:57,399
Get me out of here.

223
00:12:57,399 --> 00:13:00,573
What crack?
There's nothing wrong
with that ceiling.

224
00:13:00,573 --> 00:13:02,068
I'm only thinking
of your safety, sir.

225
00:13:02,103 --> 00:13:04,048
Now, I'd feel much better
if you slept
in a different room.

226
00:13:04,048 --> 00:13:05,809
Peterson, get out.

227
00:13:05,809 --> 00:13:07,740
And close that closet door.

228
00:13:07,775 --> 00:13:11,847
Well, wait a minute.
Many people prefer to sleep
with the closet door open.

229
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:14,813
Is there something wrong
with you?

230
00:13:15,283 --> 00:13:19,285
Yeah, it's, um,
it's the paint fumes, sir.

231
00:13:19,285 --> 00:13:22,339
They make me giddy.
Really.

232
00:13:22,339 --> 00:13:25,811
And, uh,
I'm afraid they can be hazardous
to your health, sir.

233
00:13:25,843 --> 00:13:28,712
Oh, nonsense.
No one was ever killed
by paint fumes.

234
00:13:28,746 --> 00:13:30,681
But, uh, they can cause
brain damage.

235
00:13:30,715 --> 00:13:32,854
Evidently.

236
00:13:33,785 --> 00:13:35,168
Now get out of here.

237
00:13:35,203 --> 00:13:38,188
Sir, I have some paint cans
in the closet there.

238
00:13:38,222 --> 00:13:40,590
I'd feel much better for you
if I tightened those lids.

239
00:13:40,624 --> 00:13:44,177
Whatever, just do it,
get out of here.

240
00:13:44,578 --> 00:13:46,729
Norm, I'm so glad to see you.

241
00:13:46,764 --> 00:13:48,064
- You gotta get me out of here.
- Okay.

242
00:13:48,098 --> 00:13:50,650
Every time I open the door,
it squeaks and he
starts to wake up.

243
00:13:50,684 --> 00:13:53,393
If he finds me here
in the morning,
he will fire me, hate me,

244
00:13:53,393 --> 00:13:57,329
and he is never, ever going
to want to be my boyfriend.

245
00:14:00,511 --> 00:14:03,066
Norm, are you talking
to your paints?

246
00:14:03,066 --> 00:14:04,954
Uh, yes, I am, sir.

247
00:14:04,954 --> 00:14:08,785
Come on, come on. Just,
just calm down, all right?
Calm down. Calm down.

248
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:10,957
Okay? Everything's going
to be fine.
I'm going to get you out of...

249
00:14:10,957 --> 00:14:13,014
Whoo, cashmere.

250
00:14:13,631 --> 00:14:16,283
Here's my plan, okay?
I'm going to walk out of here.

251
00:14:16,283 --> 00:14:19,150
I'm going to leave
the closet door
yea bit open, right?
So it won't squeak.

252
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:20,597
Now you wait until he's good
and sound asleep,

253
00:14:20,631 --> 00:14:22,351
and then you just walk
on out of here, okay?

254
00:14:22,366 --> 00:14:23,016
Okay.

255
00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:23,683
If you're hungry,

256
00:14:23,685 --> 00:14:24,400
I brought you some chips.

257
00:14:24,435 --> 00:14:26,619
Cajun style?

258
00:14:28,439 --> 00:14:29,689
Never mind. Just go ahead.

259
00:14:29,724 --> 00:14:30,223
Okay, all right.

260
00:14:30,257 --> 00:14:31,124
Good luck.

261
00:14:37,031 --> 00:14:39,465
Is he asleep?

262
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:40,233
Get lost.

263
00:14:40,267 --> 00:14:42,519
Getting lost, sir.

264
00:14:44,672 --> 00:14:48,374
Oh, like an open door would
really kill you, Greyson, huh?

265
00:15:35,122 --> 00:15:38,374
So you just left her
in the closet?

266
00:15:39,559 --> 00:15:41,527
I had a foolproof plan
to get her out of there

267
00:15:41,561 --> 00:15:45,999
and the whole thing got spoiled
by this anal-retentive butler.

268
00:15:46,033 --> 00:15:47,884
Mr. Peterson,
you gotta get her out of there.

269
00:15:47,918 --> 00:15:50,053
Oh...

270
00:15:50,087 --> 00:15:51,754
How did I get myself into this?

271
00:15:51,788 --> 00:15:54,124
I should have never become
a house painter.

272
00:15:54,158 --> 00:15:57,360
I should have listened to my
mother and become a matador.

273
00:15:57,395 --> 00:15:59,262
You know, Norm, you are
probably too logical.

274
00:15:59,296 --> 00:16:00,430
What?

275
00:16:00,464 --> 00:16:02,699
Yes, you see, it's an
established psychological fact

276
00:16:02,733 --> 00:16:05,201
that the more outrageous a lie
one tells,

277
00:16:05,235 --> 00:16:08,104
the more readily
will the victim believe it.

278
00:16:08,138 --> 00:16:10,239
You see, if you told Mr. Drake

279
00:16:10,274 --> 00:16:13,994
a sufficiently outlandish story,
odds are he'd buy it.

280
00:16:14,028 --> 00:16:15,445
No, that's impossible.

281
00:16:15,479 --> 00:16:17,847
No, Woody, it's a
stroke of genius.

282
00:16:17,882 --> 00:16:19,532
Frasier, you're brilliant.

283
00:16:19,566 --> 00:16:21,851
That is one of the most brilliant
ideas you've ever had.

284
00:16:21,886 --> 00:16:24,104
And you've had a lot
of brilliant ideas.

285
00:16:24,138 --> 00:16:25,455
Thank you, Carla.

286
00:16:25,489 --> 00:16:26,473
See, Woody? It works.

287
00:16:26,507 --> 00:16:27,707
Bonehead bought it.

288
00:16:30,577 --> 00:16:33,747
All right. All right.

289
00:16:33,781 --> 00:16:37,984
All right, I guess
I just gotta go do this.

290
00:16:38,019 --> 00:16:39,753
I've got to do it.

291
00:16:39,787 --> 00:16:40,987
If it doesn't work out,

292
00:16:41,022 --> 00:16:43,907
tomorrow I'm going to be
shopping for toreador pants.

293
00:16:43,941 --> 00:16:45,691
Hey, where you going?

294
00:16:45,726 --> 00:16:49,662
I gotta get Rebecca
out of the damn closet.

295
00:16:49,696 --> 00:16:51,664
You just left her in the closet?

296
00:16:55,669 --> 00:16:56,636
Where's Frasier, man?

297
00:16:56,670 --> 00:16:57,587
I gotta talk to him.

298
00:16:57,621 --> 00:16:59,139
Where's your date?

299
00:16:59,173 --> 00:17:00,206
She's at my apartment.

300
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,275
I told her I was going out
for some ice.

301
00:17:02,309 --> 00:17:04,144
I don't know,
something's wrong here.

302
00:17:04,178 --> 00:17:06,746
I've been dancing my brains
out and nothing, zilch.

303
00:17:06,781 --> 00:17:09,198
Frasier, you know that,
that beautiful girl

304
00:17:09,233 --> 00:17:10,950
you were treating this morning?

305
00:17:10,984 --> 00:17:12,802
I treated two beautiful women
this morning, Sam.

306
00:17:12,836 --> 00:17:14,103
Which one?

307
00:17:14,137 --> 00:17:16,122
The one that had the hots
for the dancers.

308
00:17:16,156 --> 00:17:17,323
Yes, why?

309
00:17:17,357 --> 00:17:21,594
<i>Well, uh, you didn't cure her,
by any chance, did you?</i>

310
00:17:21,628 --> 00:17:24,463
You don't just "cure" someone
overnight.

311
00:17:24,498 --> 00:17:27,400
Most patients require dozens
of costly sessions

312
00:17:27,434 --> 00:17:29,335
to make even minimal progress.

313
00:17:29,369 --> 00:17:31,754
God, I love this profession.

314
00:17:31,789 --> 00:17:34,090
Well, I don't know.

315
00:17:34,124 --> 00:17:35,175
Something's wrong.

316
00:17:35,209 --> 00:17:36,676
Maybe it's my dancing.

317
00:17:39,930 --> 00:17:44,266
You treated two beautiful girls
this morning?

318
00:17:45,569 --> 00:17:49,271
What did you treat
the other one for?

319
00:17:49,306 --> 00:17:51,090
Um, pyromania.

320
00:17:51,125 --> 00:17:56,146
Pyro... pyromania. Pyro...

321
00:18:40,858 --> 00:18:43,009
What?

322
00:18:52,653 --> 00:18:53,836
Stop! You can't go in there!

323
00:18:53,870 --> 00:18:57,207
Up, sir! Up quick! Bees!

324
00:18:57,241 --> 00:18:59,909
Killer bees are coming
this way from Mexico

325
00:18:59,943 --> 00:19:00,577
and they're hopping mad, sir!

326
00:19:00,611 --> 00:19:02,178
Bees?

327
00:19:02,213 --> 00:19:04,864
Yeah, those suckers could swarm
through here like a buzz saw.

328
00:19:04,898 --> 00:19:06,866
Sir, you don't have any honey
in here, do you?

329
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:08,267
Peterson, get out of here.

330
00:19:08,302 --> 00:19:10,036
And if you come back
in here again,

331
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:12,838
I'm going to have Greyson use his gun.
Understood?

332
00:19:12,873 --> 00:19:13,606
Yes, sir!

333
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:14,307
Hey, he was talking to me,

334
00:19:14,341 --> 00:19:15,491
okay, Greyson?

335
00:19:15,526 --> 00:19:17,577
Look, sir, let me just get
your robe.

336
00:19:17,611 --> 00:19:19,762
I'm very concerned
about these bees.

337
00:19:19,797 --> 00:19:22,231
Well, never mind.

338
00:19:22,266 --> 00:19:24,567
They've gone.

339
00:19:24,601 --> 00:19:26,069
Yeah. There they go.

340
00:19:26,103 --> 00:19:29,272
They're headed up
to Canada or someplace.

341
00:19:30,191 --> 00:19:31,274
What is it?

342
00:19:31,308 --> 00:19:34,110
Bee sting. They're back, sir.

343
00:19:35,762 --> 00:19:38,080
Peterson, what the hell
is going on?

344
00:19:38,115 --> 00:19:41,484
Sir, I'm sorry. I...

345
00:19:41,518 --> 00:19:44,453
I didn't want to have
to tell you this, but...

346
00:19:44,488 --> 00:19:45,989
you're forcing me to.

347
00:19:46,023 --> 00:19:48,124
Oh, please, tell me quickly.

348
00:19:48,158 --> 00:19:50,292
If I don't sleep, I'll die.

349
00:19:50,327 --> 00:19:51,928
And I'm gonna take you with me.

350
00:19:53,163 --> 00:19:55,064
It's, actually,
it's kind of personal.

351
00:19:55,098 --> 00:19:56,232
Do you mind, Greyson?

352
00:19:56,266 --> 00:19:57,417
Sir?

353
00:19:57,451 --> 00:20:00,086
Whatever. Anything that
will get him out of here.

354
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:04,007
Sir, to begin with, when I was
a little boy, I was very poor.

355
00:20:04,041 --> 00:20:05,341
Peterson, I'm not going

356
00:20:05,375 --> 00:20:08,310
to survive any story that begins
with when you were little.

357
00:20:08,345 --> 00:20:09,646
Oh, right.

358
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:12,464
Sir, I've had this fantasy
that's haunted me all my life.

359
00:20:12,499 --> 00:20:14,784
At night, when I'm lying in bed,
it comes and torments me.

360
00:20:14,819 --> 00:20:16,519
Oh, I know the feeling.

361
00:20:16,553 --> 00:20:19,189
Yes, sir. Of course you do.

362
00:20:19,223 --> 00:20:20,422
Anyway, this is my fantasy, sir.

363
00:20:20,457 --> 00:20:21,524
It's a little outrageous.

364
00:20:21,558 --> 00:20:24,027
So, uh, just stay with me.

365
00:20:24,061 --> 00:20:30,049
Even though I was born poor
and I'll never be a rich man,

366
00:20:30,083 --> 00:20:34,204
somehow, it wouldn't make any
difference if one time, sir,

367
00:20:34,238 --> 00:20:39,408
just one time,
just one darn time,

368
00:20:39,443 --> 00:20:42,178
I could do something symbolic,

369
00:20:42,213 --> 00:20:45,214
like...

370
00:20:45,248 --> 00:20:48,050
carry a rich man across the lawn
in his pajamas.

371
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:54,440
Come here.

372
00:20:54,475 --> 00:20:55,791
I know, I know, I know,
it sounds crazy, I know.

373
00:20:55,826 --> 00:20:57,727
Sir, no... sir,
I don't have a fever.

374
00:20:57,761 --> 00:20:58,594
No, I know that.

375
00:20:58,629 --> 00:21:00,479
I'm feeling
for the lobotomy scar.

376
00:21:00,513 --> 00:21:03,016
Sir, sir, please.

377
00:21:03,050 --> 00:21:04,050
Sir, please, please...

378
00:21:04,084 --> 00:21:05,919
All right, all right,
all right, all right!

379
00:21:05,953 --> 00:21:07,119
Look, if I actually

380
00:21:07,154 --> 00:21:07,754
let you do it,

381
00:21:07,788 --> 00:21:08,838
Uh-huh.

382
00:21:08,872 --> 00:21:10,006
Would you promise me,

383
00:21:10,041 --> 00:21:11,574
would you swear on
your mother's grave

384
00:21:11,608 --> 00:21:12,842
that you would let me sleep?

385
00:21:12,876 --> 00:21:14,677
Yes, sir, I swear. I prom...
No, no, no, no, no.

386
00:21:14,711 --> 00:21:15,495
You've got to do
more than promise.

387
00:21:15,529 --> 00:21:17,680
You've got to give me
your solemn oath

388
00:21:17,715 --> 00:21:19,481
as a crazy person.

389
00:21:19,516 --> 00:21:20,599
My oath, my vow, my pledge.

390
00:21:20,634 --> 00:21:21,667
I promise you.

391
00:21:21,701 --> 00:21:23,986
All right, okay.

392
00:21:24,021 --> 00:21:25,638
Thank you so much, sir.
All right.

393
00:21:25,673 --> 00:21:27,073
Thank you, thank you
very much, sir.

394
00:21:27,090 --> 00:21:30,359
Thank you, thank you, thank you,
thank you so much, sir.

395
00:21:30,394 --> 00:21:32,995
You know, sir, I don't mean
to flatter you,

396
00:21:33,029 --> 00:21:35,448
but you're very firm
for your age.

397
00:21:46,593 --> 00:21:47,927
Thank you very much, sir.

398
00:21:47,961 --> 00:21:50,330
It was everything
I dreamed it would be.

399
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:55,710
Whoa, hey, whoa,
who made the bed?

400
00:21:55,735 --> 00:21:56,552
I did, sir.

401
00:21:56,587 --> 00:21:57,403
When?

402
00:21:57,438 --> 00:21:58,571
The instant Mr. Drake

403
00:21:58,605 --> 00:21:59,805
vacated the premises.

404
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,991
You mean you came in here
the instant we left

405
00:22:02,025 --> 00:22:03,559
and you haven't left since?

406
00:22:14,104 --> 00:22:17,190
Aw, sir.

407
00:22:17,224 --> 00:22:18,858
Sir.

408
00:22:21,261 --> 00:22:22,261
Sir?

409
00:22:22,296 --> 00:22:24,697
I don't know quite how
to tell you this, sir.

410
00:22:24,732 --> 00:22:27,150
We've got to own up, sir.

411
00:22:27,184 --> 00:22:28,450
I've got to tell you the truth.

412
00:22:28,485 --> 00:22:30,119
Now... ow!

413
00:22:30,154 --> 00:22:32,422
What? What?

414
00:22:32,456 --> 00:22:34,357
Ah! Ah!

415
00:22:34,391 --> 00:22:37,543
Ahh! You should do that
before you go to sleep.

416
00:22:37,578 --> 00:22:38,644
It clears the lungs.

417
00:22:38,679 --> 00:22:39,495
Ahh!

418
00:22:39,529 --> 00:22:41,514
You'll sleep much better.

419
00:22:41,549 --> 00:22:43,750
Sweet dreams.

420
00:22:54,728 --> 00:22:56,262
Hi, sir.

421
00:22:56,296 --> 00:22:58,097
Oh, I knew it, I knew it.
You broke your word.

422
00:22:58,131 --> 00:22:59,131
No, no, no.

423
00:22:59,166 --> 00:23:00,966
You lied to me, Norm.

424
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,234
No, no, no, sir.

425
00:23:02,269 --> 00:23:03,937
You see, I went back to the bar
to tell everyone

426
00:23:03,971 --> 00:23:04,938
about my dream coming true.

427
00:23:04,972 --> 00:23:06,005
And since none of their dreams

428
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:07,720
have come true,
they wouldn't believe mine.

429
00:23:07,741 --> 00:23:09,459
Why are you doing this to me?
Why?

430
00:23:09,493 --> 00:23:10,793
Sir, my dream
is to have people know

431
00:23:10,828 --> 00:23:13,262
that I carried a rich man
across the lawn in his pajamas.

432
00:23:13,296 --> 00:23:14,630
You're going to hurt me.

433
00:23:14,665 --> 00:23:15,765
No, sir. I just need witnesses.

434
00:23:15,799 --> 00:23:17,367
I've got several
lined up outside.

435
00:23:17,401 --> 00:23:19,202
Greyson would fill out
the troop nicely, sir.

436
00:23:19,236 --> 00:23:21,137
Just a couple minutes,
This is a nightmare.

437
00:23:21,171 --> 00:23:22,021
Then it'd be all over, sir.

438
00:23:22,056 --> 00:23:23,105
You can sleep, I promise.

439
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:24,340
This isn't happening to me.

440
00:23:24,375 --> 00:23:25,608
This is a nightmare.

441
00:23:25,642 --> 00:23:27,476
Don't worry about it, sir.

442
00:23:29,179 --> 00:23:32,398
We're going out now,
but only for a minute!

443
00:23:32,432 --> 00:23:34,099
Will there be any more bees?

444
00:23:34,134 --> 00:23:35,751
Oh, no, no, no, sir.

445
00:23:35,786 --> 00:23:39,355
You shut your eyes now.
All gone, all gone.

446
00:23:41,475 --> 00:23:44,176
Hey, guys, here they come.
Here they come.

447
00:23:44,210 --> 00:23:45,511
They're coming, they're coming.
He's got Drake.

448
00:23:45,546 --> 00:23:46,679
Oh, here they come.

449
00:23:46,713 --> 00:23:48,681
Yes, Norm.
