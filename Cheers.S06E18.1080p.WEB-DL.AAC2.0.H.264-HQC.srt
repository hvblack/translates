1
00:00:01,856 --> 00:00:05,555
<i>Cheers is filmed
before a live studio audience.</i>

2
00:00:05,555 --> 00:00:07,544
No, no, it's
a well-documented fact

3
00:00:07,579 --> 00:00:11,691
that the female of the species
is irresistibly drawn
to men in uniform.

4
00:00:11,691 --> 00:00:14,384
Yeah, just yesterday, some
lonely, frustrated housewife

5
00:00:14,384 --> 00:00:17,419
saw me coming
up the garden path,
you know, peeking
through the window,

6
00:00:17,419 --> 00:00:22,396
and she tries to coyly titillate me
by pulling down the shade
so I wonder what's
going on behind it.

7
00:00:22,396 --> 00:00:26,134
Let me dispel the mystery.
She was puking.

8
00:00:26,134 --> 00:00:29,566
Carla,
don't you get bored just
hanging around here all day

9
00:00:29,566 --> 00:00:31,401
waiting to take
cheap shots at me?

10
00:00:31,435 --> 00:00:33,769
Yeah, I should get a beeper.

11
00:00:33,922 --> 00:00:36,223
All right, look. That's it.

12
00:00:36,257 --> 00:00:38,758
I am sick and tired
of being your whipping boy.

13
00:00:38,793 --> 00:00:40,393
Today the worm turns.

14
00:00:40,427 --> 00:00:44,097
You are not going to insult me
any longer,
because I am not going
to give you the chance.

15
00:00:44,132 --> 00:00:47,363
As of from right now,
I am shutting up,
zipping my lip.

16
00:00:51,372 --> 00:00:53,690
And my friends support me.

17
00:01:00,047 --> 00:01:02,565
¶ Making your way
in the world today ¶

18
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:05,518
¶ Takes everything you've got.

19
00:01:05,552 --> 00:01:08,305
¶ Taking a break
from all your worries ¶

20
00:01:08,289 --> 00:01:11,507
¶ Sure would help a lot.

21
00:01:11,542 --> 00:01:15,698
¶ Wouldn't you like
to get away? ¶

22
00:01:17,012 --> 00:01:19,566
¶ Sometimes you want to go.

23
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:24,038
¶ Where everybody
knows your name ¶

24
00:01:24,572 --> 00:01:29,119
¶ And they're always glad
you came ¶

25
00:01:29,311 --> 00:01:31,854
¶ You want to be
where you can see ¶

26
00:01:31,854 --> 00:01:34,581
¶ Our troubles
are all the same ¶

27
00:01:34,616 --> 00:01:39,553
¶ You want to be where everybody
knows your name ¶

28
00:01:39,587 --> 00:01:42,438
¶ You want to go
where people know ¶

29
00:01:42,473 --> 00:01:44,825
¶ People are all the same.

30
00:01:44,859 --> 00:01:49,949
¶ You want to go where
everybody knows your name. ¶

31
00:02:04,158 --> 00:02:06,538
You know something, chaps,

32
00:02:06,563 --> 00:02:10,698
I had a particularly fascinating
session this morning.

33
00:02:13,203 --> 00:02:15,298
No, honestly.

34
00:02:18,246 --> 00:02:20,386
Someone I was seeing
for the first time.

35
00:02:20,411 --> 00:02:22,846
Extraordinarily beautiful,
young woman,

36
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:28,501
who's uh, rather unique malaise
is to be aroused
with sexual frenzy by...

37
00:02:28,535 --> 00:02:30,098
Oh, good Lord.

38
00:02:30,098 --> 00:02:34,373
Excuse me. I don't really think
I should be discussing
my patients here.

39
00:02:38,896 --> 00:02:43,827
Uh... how about
discussing them over here?

40
00:02:44,268 --> 00:02:48,840
Well,
I suppose it wouldn't violate
any doctor-patient
confidentiality

41
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,692
if I don't use names.

42
00:02:50,692 --> 00:02:52,025
Pour the beer, Woody.

43
00:02:52,059 --> 00:02:54,643
I thought you weren't going
to use any names, Dr. Crane.

44
00:02:54,643 --> 00:02:55,717
Woody...

45
00:02:55,717 --> 00:03:01,317
Well, it seems this woman
has her passions inflamed
by men who dance.

46
00:03:01,352 --> 00:03:04,399
Wait a minute, Wait a minute.
Men who dance?

47
00:03:04,399 --> 00:03:05,376
That's weird.

48
00:03:05,376 --> 00:03:06,857
What's even more bizarre,

49
00:03:06,891 --> 00:03:09,585
is that she will catapult
herself compulsively

50
00:03:09,585 --> 00:03:13,597
into the arms of any man
in tights or tap shoes.

51
00:03:13,631 --> 00:03:15,651
Fascinating fixation.

52
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:19,152
Ooh, geez. I've got
to go. I'm sorry.

53
00:03:19,186 --> 00:03:22,378
Where you going?
My ballet class.

54
00:03:22,756 --> 00:03:25,016
No, no,
lunch, lunch.

55
00:03:25,016 --> 00:03:26,359
That was a little psychological
humor.

56
00:03:26,394 --> 00:03:28,218
You know, as my old
professor used to say,

57
00:03:28,218 --> 00:03:31,417
if you can't laugh
at your patients,
what fun are they?

58
00:03:32,816 --> 00:03:34,243
See you later.

59
00:03:34,243 --> 00:03:35,220
Norm.

60
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:38,340
- Morning, everybody.
- Norm!

61
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:40,823
Can I pour you a draft,
Mr. Peterson?

62
00:03:40,858 --> 00:03:42,238
A little early, isn't it, Woody?

63
00:03:42,259 --> 00:03:45,628
- For a beer?
- No, for stupid questions.

64
00:03:45,663 --> 00:03:47,764
Pour.

65
00:03:47,798 --> 00:03:50,033
Would you believe the board
of directors is asking

66
00:03:50,068 --> 00:03:54,373
for a breakdown
of projected earnings
for the next six months?

67
00:03:54,939 --> 00:03:56,772
Yes.

68
00:03:57,524 --> 00:04:00,228
Rebecca,
I started painting
Mr. Drake's house.

69
00:04:00,228 --> 00:04:01,894
I want to thank you
for that recommendation.

70
00:04:01,929 --> 00:04:04,064
Oh, it was my pleasure, Norm.
How's it going?

71
00:04:04,098 --> 00:04:06,783
Great, great.
He's out of town for a few days
so, uh,

72
00:04:06,817 --> 00:04:09,435
I thought it'd be a good time
to get started in his bedroom.

73
00:04:09,369 --> 00:04:11,138
I was doing a little prep
work over there this morning,

74
00:04:11,172 --> 00:04:12,839
and I must say, that's
a cute photo of you

75
00:04:12,873 --> 00:04:14,608
he has next
to his night stand there.

76
00:04:14,608 --> 00:04:17,402
- What?
- Just kidding.

77
00:04:19,164 --> 00:04:21,131
I will kill you, Norm.

78
00:04:21,165 --> 00:04:23,950
You know, uh,
I am over there all by myself,

79
00:04:23,984 --> 00:04:26,953
so if you want
to drop by and, uh,
check any of the house out,

80
00:04:26,987 --> 00:04:28,655
I can get you in.

81
00:04:28,689 --> 00:04:31,290
No... I can't.

82
00:04:31,325 --> 00:04:35,043
Oh, go on.
You're dying to look
in his drawers.

83
00:04:36,042 --> 00:04:38,983
That's right, he won't be there.

84
00:04:40,317 --> 00:04:43,936
The last thing on my mind
is Evan Drake
and where he sleeps.

85
00:04:43,971 --> 00:04:45,486
No, I don't want
to be distracted.

86
00:04:45,486 --> 00:04:47,891
I've got to get these figures
into the bed of directors...

87
00:04:47,925 --> 00:04:50,276
board of directors.

88
00:04:50,978 --> 00:04:54,815
- Shall we say in one hour?
- I'll be there.

89
00:04:58,619 --> 00:05:00,903
Excuse me,
I'm looking for Dr. Crane.

90
00:05:00,938 --> 00:05:02,272
He mentioned he'd be here.

91
00:05:02,306 --> 00:05:03,793
Oh, I'm sorry,
you just missed him.

92
00:05:03,793 --> 00:05:06,865
Oh, darn.
I had a session earlier today

93
00:05:06,865 --> 00:05:10,064
and left a package
in his office.
When I went back, it was locked.

94
00:05:10,098 --> 00:05:11,598
Gee, I don't know
what to tell you.

95
00:05:11,632 --> 00:05:14,555
But then again, I don't know
what to tell most people.

96
00:05:15,143 --> 00:05:18,369
Uh, excuse me.
Uh, you had a session with him?

97
00:05:18,369 --> 00:05:19,822
Are you a patient of his?

98
00:05:19,856 --> 00:05:23,334
- That's right. Why?
- Oh, just curious.

99
00:05:29,336 --> 00:05:32,036
Well, it's not that important.

100
00:05:32,036 --> 00:05:34,414
I just thought if I caught him,
I could still
get my package back.

101
00:05:34,414 --> 00:05:36,345
I understand perfectly.

102
00:05:41,859 --> 00:05:46,394
Well, I'm out of luck, I guess.
I'll just have
to stop by tomorrow.

103
00:05:48,736 --> 00:05:52,555
¶ Gotta dance, gotta dance... ¶

104
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:55,915
- Why are you doing that?
- This? Oh...

105
00:05:56,678 --> 00:06:00,446
I guess it's kind of an
old reflex with us hoofers.

106
00:06:00,481 --> 00:06:03,995
Oh. You're a dancer?
Well, kind of.

107
00:06:03,995 --> 00:06:05,907
Yeah... my name's Sam Malone

108
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:08,372
but people call me Bojangles.

109
00:06:08,372 --> 00:06:11,274
- Jennifer McCall.
- Jennifer McCall, whoo...

110
00:06:11,309 --> 00:06:14,610
That's a beautiful name
for a beautiful girl.

111
00:06:14,645 --> 00:06:16,345
Well, thank you.
I have to be going.

112
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:20,774
Well, at least let me,
uh, waltz you
to the door here, all right?

113
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:23,753
I know I'm not
very sophisticated,

114
00:06:23,753 --> 00:06:25,955
but I don't think
what Sam is doing is right.

115
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:28,976
Well, look,
don't you put yourself
down with me,

116
00:06:28,976 --> 00:06:30,427
and I happen to agree with you.

117
00:06:30,461 --> 00:06:32,740
I mean, standing around
tending bar all day

118
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:36,236
is like the worst thing
a dancer could do
for his calves.

119
00:06:38,435 --> 00:06:41,471
Speaking of calves, Woody,

120
00:06:41,505 --> 00:06:44,946
was it painful when the cow
kicked you in the head?

121
00:06:45,234 --> 00:06:47,718
You get used to it.

122
00:06:48,495 --> 00:06:51,330
Why don't I stop back
and um, we'll go to lunch.

123
00:06:51,365 --> 00:06:53,725
Oh, I'm looking forward to it
already.

124
00:06:56,569 --> 00:06:59,122
Ow, got a cramp. Oh, God...

125
00:06:59,156 --> 00:07:00,829
Ow, Woody...

126
00:07:02,626 --> 00:07:05,928
And, uh, here's his bedroom.

127
00:07:11,072 --> 00:07:13,987
I feel kind of queasy.

128
00:07:14,021 --> 00:07:17,123
Like I don't belong here.
Like I'm doing something wrong.

129
00:07:17,157 --> 00:07:19,481
I know... that's how I feel
in my bedroom.

130
00:07:22,663 --> 00:07:25,665
I just feel kind of like
I'm trespassing.

131
00:07:25,699 --> 00:07:29,175
Like I'm invading his privacy.

132
00:07:31,505 --> 00:07:33,639
This is not right.

133
00:07:37,795 --> 00:07:41,413
This is not right.
I should not be doing this.

134
00:07:41,749 --> 00:07:47,305
I shouldn't.
I shouldn't, I shouldn't.

135
00:07:48,855 --> 00:07:51,590
Would you like to be alone?

136
00:07:52,759 --> 00:07:54,827
Sorry.

137
00:07:55,932 --> 00:07:59,766
Well, as long as I'm here,
I guess it wouldn't hurt for me
to just look around
a little bit.

138
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:02,669
Sure.
Now, I suggested Navajo white,

139
00:08:02,703 --> 00:08:05,372
but he went with sandstone.
What do you think?

140
00:08:05,406 --> 00:08:08,296
This is where he keeps
his clothes, isn't it?

141
00:08:08,509 --> 00:08:10,443
Do you think anybody heard that?

142
00:08:10,477 --> 00:08:13,291
- Like who?
- I don't know. I'm just nervous.

143
00:08:13,291 --> 00:08:15,565
God, there's no way I could
explain it if I got caught.

144
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:16,799
How are you going to get caught?

145
00:08:16,833 --> 00:08:20,130
Because people always get caught
in this situation.

146
00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:23,870
- What if Evan comes back
unexpectedly.
- Look, he's in Europe, okay?

147
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:26,108
You don't come back
unexpectedly from Europe.

148
00:08:26,143 --> 00:08:29,399
You come back unexpectedly
from the movies or shopping.

149
00:08:29,399 --> 00:08:32,056
But you don't come back
unexpect...

150
00:08:32,316 --> 00:08:34,200
What? What?

151
00:08:34,234 --> 00:08:37,757
Oh, my God, it's Mr. Drake!
He's back unexpectedly
from Europe!

152
00:08:38,322 --> 00:08:40,271
Oh, I have to get out of here.

153
00:08:40,271 --> 00:08:43,776
Norm, are you here?
- Uh, yes, sir.
Be right down, sir.

154
00:08:43,810 --> 00:08:45,278
No, that's all right,
I'm coming up.

155
00:08:45,312 --> 00:08:47,947
For the love of...
Go, go, go, go, go.

156
00:08:51,051 --> 00:08:54,137
Norm...
- Oh, oh, right, right.
- Okay.

157
00:08:55,706 --> 00:08:59,608
- Ah, Norm... there you are.
- Hi, sir.

158
00:08:59,643 --> 00:09:01,144
What are you doing here, sir?

159
00:09:01,178 --> 00:09:05,414
Oh, I wound up everything
in a marathon session.
I haven't slept for three days.

160
00:09:05,449 --> 00:09:09,633
Three days.
Let me take you out
for a cup of coffee, sir.

161
00:09:10,021 --> 00:09:13,155
No, no, no.
All I want to do is
sleep for about a week.

162
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:14,758
Should I get your pajamas, sir?

163
00:09:14,792 --> 00:09:15,985
No!

164
00:09:16,109 --> 00:09:19,200
- No?
- No.

165
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,298
<i>Oh, I thought you meant
my pajamas.</i>

166
00:09:22,766 --> 00:09:25,785
No, they're, uh, they're
too far away from here

167
00:09:25,819 --> 00:09:28,566
and I don't even think
they'd fit Mr. Drake.

168
00:09:28,808 --> 00:09:33,588
Actually, I think you'll find
a clean pair of pajamas
in the bag.

169
00:09:35,238 --> 00:09:37,017
I thought you were
going to fix that.

170
00:09:37,017 --> 00:09:39,248
Oh, yeah, that squeak.
I'm going to fix that squeak,
sir.

171
00:09:39,282 --> 00:09:42,555
You should go to another room.
I may need to use
the jaws of life.

172
00:09:42,555 --> 00:09:44,960
Uh, no, just leave it, will ya?

173
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:47,657
As a matter of fact, forget
the painting thing, too.

174
00:09:47,657 --> 00:09:50,576
I'm a light sleeper,
and I don't want to hear you
rattling your paint cans.

175
00:09:50,611 --> 00:09:53,513
Well, that's one thing
I've never been accused of, sir,
is rattling my cans.

176
00:09:53,546 --> 00:09:56,413
Please, I mean it, Norm. Scoot.

177
00:09:57,951 --> 00:10:01,286
- Huh?
- Yes, sir.

178
00:10:04,158 --> 00:10:06,976
So you're a really light
sleeper, sir?

179
00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:10,190
Yes, but I have
excellent hearing, Norm.

180
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:15,572
Yeah, most light sleepers do.
That's what makes them
light sleepers.

181
00:10:26,013 --> 00:10:28,382
So you just left her
in the closet?

182
00:10:28,382 --> 00:10:32,574
Believe me, I did
everything I could
to get the guy out of the room
for like one minute,

183
00:10:32,574 --> 00:10:34,277
but he wouldn't budge.

184
00:10:34,705 --> 00:10:37,729
So you just left her
in the closet?

185
00:10:37,942 --> 00:10:41,517
There was nothing else
I could do, okay?

186
00:10:41,962 --> 00:10:45,264
So you just
left her in the closet?

187
00:10:45,264 --> 00:10:48,584
Carla, it wasn't
my fault, all right?

188
00:10:49,053 --> 00:10:53,106
It's been at least an hour.
She should have
snuck out by now.

189
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:55,950
Oh, come on.
She'd be here
if she'd gotten away.

190
00:10:55,950 --> 00:10:57,360
You gotta get her out of there.

191
00:10:57,394 --> 00:11:00,730
Hey, look.
You, uh, you think of it
as an adventure.

192
00:11:00,765 --> 00:11:02,749
She's the damsel in distress

193
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:07,403
and you are the knight
in shiny white armor,
leaping upon your steed.

194
00:11:07,437 --> 00:11:10,990
And driving it into the ground
up to its knees.

195
00:11:11,759 --> 00:11:15,461
No, no, no, no, and
saving a damsel.

196
00:11:16,763 --> 00:11:20,582
I guess you're right,
you're right.
I gotta go do this.

197
00:11:20,617 --> 00:11:23,674
Listen, uh, Cliffie,
if I'm not back in an hour,

198
00:11:23,674 --> 00:11:25,338
go ahead and finish my beer.

199
00:11:25,372 --> 00:11:27,277
This is your beer.

200
00:11:28,875 --> 00:11:32,027
Sammy, I hear you got
a sure thing lined up, huh?

201
00:11:32,061 --> 00:11:34,760
Mm, no, I never like
to use the term "sure thing."

202
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:37,677
I prefer the term "in the bag."

203
00:11:39,053 --> 00:11:40,288
What? What?

204
00:11:40,288 --> 00:11:42,237
Ah, Sammy, come on.
Isn't this, you know,

205
00:11:42,272 --> 00:11:45,703
pretending to be a phony-bologna
dancer a little bit beneath you?

206
00:11:45,703 --> 00:11:48,645
I mean,
when I go picking up girls,
I don't need all that stuff.

207
00:11:48,679 --> 00:11:50,309
All I need is a wink
and a smile.

208
00:11:50,331 --> 00:11:53,224
And a rag doused
with chloroform.

209
00:11:55,135 --> 00:11:58,654
I don't know, Sammy.
It looks to me like you're
getting a little desperate.

210
00:11:58,689 --> 00:12:00,456
What are you talk...
I'm not desperate.

211
00:12:00,491 --> 00:12:02,625
I don't know what
you're talking about.

212
00:12:03,113 --> 00:12:04,827
Ready, Sam?

213
00:12:04,862 --> 00:12:07,029
Oh, hi, Jennifer.
I'll be right with you.

214
00:12:07,063 --> 00:12:08,874
See you guys later.

215
00:12:13,937 --> 00:12:16,219
Ready to go? Mm-hmm.

216
00:12:38,061 --> 00:12:40,964
Mr. Drake!
Mr. Drake, sir!

217
00:12:40,998 --> 00:12:43,700
Sorry, sir, but Mr. Peterson
said it was an emergency.

218
00:12:43,735 --> 00:12:45,035
What? Emergency?

219
00:12:45,069 --> 00:12:48,655
Yeah, structural, Evan.
It's just a damn good thing
I went back
and checked those blueprints.

220
00:12:48,690 --> 00:12:51,027
This ceiling could go
at any second.
- Ceiling?

221
00:12:51,027 --> 00:12:55,528
Yeah, it's a crack, sir.
It extends all the way
into, uh, here.

222
00:12:55,562 --> 00:12:57,399
Get me out of here.

223
00:12:57,399 --> 00:13:00,573
What crack?
There's nothing wrong
with that ceiling.

224
00:13:00,573 --> 00:13:02,068
I'm only thinking
of your safety, sir.

225
00:13:02,103 --> 00:13:04,048
Now, I'd feel much better
if you slept
in a different room.

226
00:13:04,048 --> 00:13:05,809
Peterson, get out.

227
00:13:05,809 --> 00:13:07,740
And close that closet door.

228
00:13:07,775 --> 00:13:11,847
Well, wait a minute.
Many people prefer to sleep
with the closet door open.

229
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:14,813
Is there something wrong
with you?

230
00:13:15,283 --> 00:13:19,285
Yeah, it's, um,
it's the paint fumes, sir.

231
00:13:19,285 --> 00:13:22,339
They make me giddy.
Really.

232
00:13:22,339 --> 00:13:25,811
And, uh,
I'm afraid they can be hazardous
to your health, sir.

233
00:13:25,843 --> 00:13:28,712
Oh, nonsense.
No one was ever killed
by paint fumes.

234
00:13:28,746 --> 00:13:30,681
But, uh, they can cause
brain damage.

235
00:13:30,715 --> 00:13:32,854
Evidently.

236
00:13:33,785 --> 00:13:35,168
Now get out of here.

237
00:13:35,203 --> 00:13:38,188
Sir, I have some paint cans
in the closet there.

238
00:13:38,222 --> 00:13:40,590
I'd feel much better for you
if I tightened those lids.

239
00:13:40,624 --> 00:13:44,177
Whatever, just do it,
get out of here.

240
00:13:44,578 --> 00:13:46,729
Norm, I'm so glad to see you.

241
00:13:46,764 --> 00:13:48,064
- You gotta get me out of here.
- Okay.

242
00:13:48,098 --> 00:13:50,650
Every time I open the door,
it squeaks and he
starts to wake up.

243
00:13:50,684 --> 00:13:53,393
If he finds me here
in the morning,
he will fire me, hate me,

244
00:13:53,393 --> 00:13:57,329
and he is never, ever going
to want to be my boyfriend.

245
00:14:00,511 --> 00:14:03,066
Norm, are you talking
to your paints?

246
00:14:03,066 --> 00:14:04,954
Uh, yes, I am, sir.

247
00:14:04,954 --> 00:14:08,785
Come on, come on. Just,
just calm down, all right?
Calm down. Calm down.

248
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:10,957
Okay? Everything's going
to be fine.
I'm going to get you out of...

249
00:14:10,957 --> 00:14:13,014
Whoo, cashmere.

250
00:14:13,631 --> 00:14:16,283
Here's my plan, okay?
I'm going to walk out of here.

251
00:14:16,283 --> 00:14:19,150
I'm going to leave
the closet door
yea bit open, right?
So it won't squeak.

252
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:20,985
Now you wait until he's good
and sound asleep,

253
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:22,766
and then you just walk
on out of here, okay?
Okay.

254
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,968
If you're hungry,
I brought you some chips.

255
00:14:24,968 --> 00:14:27,560
Cajun style?

256
00:14:28,239 --> 00:14:31,819
- Never mind. Just go ahead.
- Okay, all right.
Good luck.

257
00:14:37,431 --> 00:14:39,287
Is he asleep?

258
00:14:39,287 --> 00:14:43,354
- Get lost.
- Getting lost, sir.

259
00:14:44,072 --> 00:14:47,938
Oh, like an open door would
really kill you, Greyson, huh?

260
00:15:35,422 --> 00:15:38,303
So you just left her
in the closet?

261
00:15:39,559 --> 00:15:41,592
I had a foolproof plan
to get her out of there

262
00:15:41,592 --> 00:15:45,256
and the whole thing got spoiled
by this anal-retentive butler.

263
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:48,679
Mr. Peterson,
you gotta get her out of there.

264
00:15:50,087 --> 00:15:52,390
How did I get myself into this?

265
00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:54,074
I should have never become
a house painter.

266
00:15:54,108 --> 00:15:56,626
I should have listened to my
mother and become a matador.

267
00:15:56,626 --> 00:15:59,737
- You know, Norm, you are
probably too logical.
- What?

268
00:15:59,737 --> 00:16:02,735
Yes, you see, it's an
established psychological fact

269
00:16:02,735 --> 00:16:05,920
that the more outrageous a lie
one tells,

270
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,854
the more readily
will the victim believe it.

271
00:16:07,888 --> 00:16:12,743
You see, if you told Mr. Drake
a sufficiently outlandish story,

272
00:16:12,743 --> 00:16:13,944
odds are he'd buy it.

273
00:16:13,978 --> 00:16:15,569
No, that's impossible.

274
00:16:15,569 --> 00:16:19,532
No, Woody, it's a
stroke of genius.
Frasier, you're brilliant.

275
00:16:19,566 --> 00:16:22,151
That is one of the most brilliant
ideas you've ever had.

276
00:16:22,151 --> 00:16:24,104
And you've had a lot
of brilliant ideas.

277
00:16:24,138 --> 00:16:25,405
Thank you, Carla.

278
00:16:25,439 --> 00:16:28,485
See, Woody? It works.
Bonehead bought it.

279
00:16:30,827 --> 00:16:33,747
All right. All right.

280
00:16:33,781 --> 00:16:38,137
All right, I guess
I just gotta go do this.

281
00:16:38,137 --> 00:16:39,753
I've got to do it.

282
00:16:39,787 --> 00:16:44,151
If it doesn't work out,
tomorrow I'm going to be
shopping for toreador pants.

283
00:16:44,371 --> 00:16:48,999
- Hey, where you going?
- I gotta get Rebecca
out of the damn closet.

284
00:16:48,999 --> 00:16:52,250
You just left her in the closet?

285
00:16:55,701 --> 00:16:58,348
Where's Frasier, man?
I gotta talk to him.

286
00:16:58,348 --> 00:17:00,206
- Where's your date?
- She's at my apartment.

287
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,275
I told her I was going out
for some ice.

288
00:17:02,309 --> 00:17:06,846
I don't know,
something's wrong here.
I've been dancing my brains
out and nothing, zilch.

289
00:17:06,881 --> 00:17:11,045
Frasier, you know that,
that beautiful girl
you were treating this morning?

290
00:17:11,045 --> 00:17:14,103
I treated two beautiful women
this morning, Sam.
Which one?

291
00:17:14,137 --> 00:17:17,323
- The one that had the hots
for the dancers.
- Yes, why?

292
00:17:17,357 --> 00:17:21,594
Well, uh, you didn't cure her,
by any chance, did you?

293
00:17:21,628 --> 00:17:24,063
You don't just "cure" someone
overnight.

294
00:17:24,098 --> 00:17:29,335
Most patients require dozens
of costly sessions
to make even minimal progress.

295
00:17:29,369 --> 00:17:31,791
God, I love this profession.

296
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:37,136
Well, I don't know.
Something's wrong.
Maybe it's my dancing.

297
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:45,052
You treated two beautiful girls
this morning?

298
00:17:46,269 --> 00:17:49,655
What did you treat
the other one for?

299
00:17:49,655 --> 00:17:51,258
Um, pyromania.

300
00:17:51,258 --> 00:17:56,444
Pyro... pyromania. Pyro...

301
00:18:41,311 --> 00:18:42,982
What?

302
00:18:52,353 --> 00:18:54,885
Stop! You can't go in there!

303
00:18:54,885 --> 00:18:57,287
Up, sir! Up quick! Bees!

304
00:18:57,287 --> 00:19:01,264
Killer bees are coming
this way from Mexico
and they're hopping mad, sir!

305
00:19:01,264 --> 00:19:04,664
- Bees?
- Yeah, those suckers could swarm
through here like a buzz saw.

306
00:19:04,698 --> 00:19:06,566
Sir, you don't have any honey
in here, do you?

307
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,696
Peterson, get out of here.

308
00:19:08,696 --> 00:19:12,161
And if you come back
in here again,
I'm going to have Greyson use his gun.

309
00:19:12,161 --> 00:19:13,581
- Understood?
- Yes, sir!

310
00:19:13,581 --> 00:19:15,441
Hey, he was talking to me,
okay, Greyson?

311
00:19:15,476 --> 00:19:19,762
Look, sir, let me just get
your robe.
I'm very concerned
about these bees.

312
00:19:19,797 --> 00:19:23,983
Well, never mind.
They've gone.

313
00:19:24,223 --> 00:19:29,020
Yeah. There they go.
They're headed up
to Canada or someplace.

314
00:19:30,191 --> 00:19:33,689
- What is it?
- Bee sting. They're back, sir.

315
00:19:35,662 --> 00:19:38,629
Peterson, what the hell
is going on?

316
00:19:38,629 --> 00:19:44,453
Sir, I'm sorry. I...
I didn't want to have
to tell you this, but...

317
00:19:44,488 --> 00:19:45,939
you're forcing me to.

318
00:19:45,973 --> 00:19:50,292
Oh, please, tell me quickly.
If I don't sleep, I'll die.

319
00:19:50,327 --> 00:19:52,332
And I'm gonna take you with me.

320
00:19:53,063 --> 00:19:56,303
It's, actually,
it's kind of personal.
Do you mind, Greyson?

321
00:19:56,303 --> 00:20:00,086
- Sir?
- Whatever. Anything that
will get him out of here.

322
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:04,007
Sir, to begin with, when I was
a little boy, I was very poor.

323
00:20:04,041 --> 00:20:05,341
Peterson, I'm not going

324
00:20:05,375 --> 00:20:08,110
to survive any story that begins
with when you were little.

325
00:20:08,145 --> 00:20:12,314
Oh, right.
Sir, I've had this fantasy
that's haunted me all my life.

326
00:20:12,349 --> 00:20:14,857
At night, when I'm lying in bed,
it comes and torments me.

327
00:20:14,857 --> 00:20:18,308
- Oh, I know the feeling.
- Yes, sir. Of course you do.

328
00:20:18,308 --> 00:20:21,634
Anyway, this is my fantasy, sir.
It's a little outrageous.

329
00:20:21,634 --> 00:20:24,540
So, uh, just stay with me.

330
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:30,049
Even though I was born poor
and I'll never be a rich man,

331
00:20:30,083 --> 00:20:34,811
somehow, it wouldn't make any
difference if one time, sir,

332
00:20:34,811 --> 00:20:39,408
just one time,
just one darn time,

333
00:20:39,443 --> 00:20:43,979
I could do something symbolic,
like...

334
00:20:45,148 --> 00:20:48,800
carry a rich man across the lawn
in his pajamas.

335
00:20:53,090 --> 00:20:55,741
- Come here.
- I know, I know, I know,
it sounds crazy, I know.

336
00:20:55,776 --> 00:20:57,768
Sir, no... sir,
I don't have a fever.

337
00:20:57,768 --> 00:21:00,953
No, I know that.
I'm feeling
for the lobotomy scar.

338
00:21:00,953 --> 00:21:05,919
- Sir, sir, please.
Sir, please, please...
- All right, all right,
all right, all right!

339
00:21:05,953 --> 00:21:08,838
- Look, if I actually
let you do it,
- Uh-huh.

340
00:21:08,872 --> 00:21:12,842
Would you promise me,
would you swear on
your mother's grave
that you would let me sleep?

341
00:21:12,876 --> 00:21:15,563
- Yes, sir, I swear. I prom...
- No, no, no, no, no.
You've got to do
more than promise.

342
00:21:15,563 --> 00:21:19,481
You've got to give me
your solemn oath
as a crazy person.

343
00:21:19,516 --> 00:21:21,667
My oath, my vow, my pledge.
I promise you.

344
00:21:21,701 --> 00:21:24,014
All right, okay.

345
00:21:24,014 --> 00:21:27,073
Thank you so much, sir.
Thank you, thank you
very much, sir.

346
00:21:27,090 --> 00:21:30,649
Thank you, thank you, thank you,
thank you so much, sir.

347
00:21:30,732 --> 00:21:35,448
You know, sir, I don't mean
to flatter you,
but you're very firm
for your age.

348
00:21:46,593 --> 00:21:51,197
Thank you very much, sir.
It was everything
I dreamed it would be.

349
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:56,745
- Whoa, hey, whoa,
who made the bed?
- I did, sir.

350
00:21:56,745 --> 00:22:00,083
- When?
- The instant Mr. Drake
vacated the premises.

351
00:22:00,083 --> 00:22:04,669
You mean you came in here
the instant we left
and you haven't left since?

352
00:22:14,104 --> 00:22:16,270
Aw, sir.

353
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:18,643
Sir.

354
00:22:21,261 --> 00:22:22,673
Sir?

355
00:22:22,673 --> 00:22:25,041
I don't know quite how
to tell you this, sir.

356
00:22:25,041 --> 00:22:29,472
We've got to own up, sir.
I've got to tell you the truth.

357
00:22:30,588 --> 00:22:33,025
What? What?

358
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:39,540
Ahh! You should do that
before you go to sleep.
It clears the lungs.

359
00:22:39,689 --> 00:22:41,514
You'll sleep much better.

360
00:22:41,549 --> 00:22:43,592
Sweet dreams.

361
00:22:54,728 --> 00:22:56,112
Hi, sir.

362
00:22:56,146 --> 00:22:59,329
- Oh, I knew it, I knew it.
You broke your word.
- No, no, no.

363
00:22:59,329 --> 00:23:02,370
- You lied to me, Norm.
- No, no, no, sir.

364
00:23:02,370 --> 00:23:05,173
You see, I went back to the bar
to tell everyone
about my dream coming true.

365
00:23:05,173 --> 00:23:07,620
And since none of their dreams
have come true,
they wouldn't believe mine.

366
00:23:07,641 --> 00:23:09,459
Why are you doing this to me?
Why?

367
00:23:09,493 --> 00:23:13,012
Sir, my dream
is to have people know
that I carried a rich man
across the lawn in his pajamas.

368
00:23:13,046 --> 00:23:16,100
- You're going to hurt me.
- No, sir. I just need witnesses.

369
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:19,353
I've got several
lined up outside.
Greyson would fill out
the troop nicely, sir.

370
00:23:19,353 --> 00:23:20,648
- This is a nightmare.
- Just a couple minutes,

371
00:23:20,648 --> 00:23:22,510
Then it'd be all over, sir.
You can sleep, I promise.

372
00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:24,996
This isn't happening to me.
This is a nightmare.

373
00:23:24,996 --> 00:23:27,376
Don't worry about it, sir.

374
00:23:28,629 --> 00:23:31,789
We're going out now,
but only for a minute!

375
00:23:31,789 --> 00:23:35,525
- Will there be any more bees?
- Oh, no, no, no, sir.

376
00:23:35,525 --> 00:23:39,555
You shut your eyes now.
All gone, all gone.

377
00:23:41,803 --> 00:23:45,511
Hey, guys, here they come.
Here they come.
They're coming, they're coming.
He's got Drake.

378
00:24:01,089 --> 00:24:21,512
translate
