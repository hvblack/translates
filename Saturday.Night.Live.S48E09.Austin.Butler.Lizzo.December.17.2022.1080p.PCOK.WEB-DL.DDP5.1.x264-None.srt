1
00:00:01,848 --> 00:00:04,884
HOLIDAYS

2
00:00:04,884 --> 00:00:07,321
CHRISTMAS

3
00:00:07,321 --> 00:00:12,552
REMIND

4
00:00:19,558 --> 00:00:22,193
HELLO.
THIS IS DONALD TRUMP,

5
00:00:22,193 --> 00:00:24,543
HOPEFULLY,
YOUR FAVORITE PRESIDENT OF ALL TIME.

6
00:00:24,543 --> 00:00:27,412
BETTER THAN LINCOLN, BETTER THAN
WASHINGTON.

7
00:00:27,412 --> 00:00:29,636
FRANKLY, BETTER THAN EZRA.

8
00:00:29,636 --> 00:00:33,191
YOU, YOU MAY HAVE SEEN THIS
WEEK, I MADE A MAJOR ANNOUNCEMENT.

9
00:00:33,191 --> 00:00:35,789
I'M DOING MY OFFICIAL FIRST
COLLECTION

10
00:00:35,789 --> 00:00:39,126
OF DONALD TRUMP
DIGITAL TRADING CARDS,

11
00:00:39,126 --> 00:00:42,630
OR NIFTIES.

12
00:00:42,631 --> 00:00:45,024
SO NEAT

13
00:00:45,024 --> 00:00:49,422
THEY FEATURE INCREDIBLE ARTWORK,
MY LIFE AND MY CAREER

14
00:00:49,422 --> 00:00:52,454
FOR EXAMPLE, WHEN I WAS AN ASTRONAUT

15
00:00:52,454 --> 00:00:55,615
OR ME RIDING BIG ELEPHANT.

16
00:00:55,615 --> 00:00:59,600
TRUMP CARDS ARE EACH $99.
SEEMS LIKE A LOT.

17
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,234
SEEMS LIKE A SCAM, AND IN MANY
WAYS IT IS,

18
00:01:02,234 --> 00:01:05,333
BUT WE LOVE THE
TRUMP CARDS, WE LOVE THEM.

19
00:01:05,333 --> 00:01:07,217
YOU CAN ALSO GET THEM FOR FREE

20
00:01:07,217 --> 00:01:10,830
BY GOING ONLINE AND LOOKING AT
THEM, MAYBE, I DON'T KNOW.

21
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:12,399
TAKING A SCREEN SHOT.

22
00:01:12,399 --> 00:01:16,473
BUT WE'D REALLY PREFER IT IF
YOU'D SEND THE $99.

23
00:01:16,473 --> 00:01:19,459
YOU'LL GET ME AS A COWBOY.

24
00:01:19,459 --> 00:01:24,015
OR ME MELTING BIDEN'S ICE CREAM
WITH MY BIG LASER EYES.

25
00:01:24,015 --> 00:01:28,758
IT SOUNDS A LOT LIKE POKEMON,
BUT TRUST ME, IT'S NOT POKEMON.

26
00:01:28,874 --> 00:01:32,746
I MEAN ABSOLUTELY NO DISRESPECT
TO MY VERY GOOD FRIENDS,

27
00:01:32,746 --> 00:01:34,983
RIGHT
MERYL

28
00:01:34,983 --> 00:01:38,906
MALE
FEMALE

29
00:01:38,906 --> 00:01:41,552
AND I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE WONDERING,
CAN THEY FIGHT?

30
00:01:41,552 --> 00:01:43,570
THE ANSWER IS YES.

31
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:46,959
WHO WILL WIN, BETWEEN TRUMP
CROSSING THE DELAWARE

32
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:49,756
AND TRUMP
BEING MATRIX?

33
00:01:49,756 --> 00:01:53,791
AND BEST PART IS, EACH CARD COMES
WITH AN AUTOMATIC CHANCE

34
00:01:53,791 --> 00:01:56,653
TO WIN AN EXCLUSIVE MYSTERY PRIZE

35
00:01:56,653 --> 00:01:59,933
WHERE
YOU GET TO PICK ANYTHING OUT OF
THIS NICE BOX.

36
00:01:59,933 --> 00:02:01,823
CLASSIFIED

37
00:02:02,518 --> 00:02:07,425
NOW, REMEMBER, WHEN YOU BUY A
CARD, YOU DON'T GET TO PICK
WHICH ONE.

38
00:02:07,425 --> 00:02:10,942
YOU MIGHT GET ME ON THE COVER OF
A ROMANCE NOVEL,

39
00:02:10,942 --> 00:02:13,629
ME DOING SPLITS,

40
00:02:13,629 --> 00:02:16,176
ME DOING "TITANIC."

41
00:02:16,176 --> 00:02:19,216
OR EVEN ME AS JESSICA RABBIT. WOW.

42
00:02:19,216 --> 00:02:23,755
LOOK AT THE LEGS ON HER.
PERHAPS I WOULD DATE HER IF SHE
WEREN'T ME.

43
00:02:23,755 --> 00:02:29,285
NOW TO HELP ME SAY MORE, MY
THIRD LEAST EMBARRASSING CHILD.

44
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,997
HEY, DAD.
VERY FUNNY.

45
00:02:35,997 --> 00:02:37,922
AND IT'S SO GOOD TO BE HERE

46
00:02:37,922 --> 00:02:42,298
FOR THE LAUNCH OF THIS AMAZING
TOTALLY LEGIT PRODUCT.

47
00:02:42,298 --> 00:02:46,306
THESE CARDS ARE FANTASTIC AND A STEAL.

48
00:02:46,306 --> 00:02:50,086
AND I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE THINKING.
$99?

49
00:02:50,086 --> 00:02:53,754
YOU CAN GET TWO GRAMS FOR THAT.

50
00:02:53,754 --> 00:02:57,815
WHILE I'M HERE, I ALSO WANTED TO SHARE,

51
00:02:57,815 --> 00:03:00,502
I'M SELLING A NEW CHRISTMAS CD

52
00:03:00,502 --> 00:03:04,254
FROM MY FIANCE
KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE.

53
00:03:04,254 --> 00:03:08,079
HEY, BABE, GET THAT LITTLE FINE
BUTT OUT HERE.

54
00:03:12,552 --> 00:03:16,839
THANK YOU.
AND I KNOW YOU'RE
GOING TO LOVE THIS CHRISTMAS ALBUM

55
00:03:16,839 --> 00:03:20,588
THAT I'M CALLING "NOW
THAT'S WHAT NO ONE CALLS MUSIC."

56
00:03:20,588 --> 00:03:26,436
I GUARANTEE, YOU'LL SLEEP IN
HEAVENLY PEACE!

57
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:32,528
BEAUTIFUL.

58
00:03:32,528 --> 00:03:35,004
THANK YOU. OKAY.

59
00:03:36,545 --> 00:03:40,067
THERE THEY GO.
WHAT A TERRIBLE COUPLE.

60
00:03:40,067 --> 00:03:42,930
SO GET YOUR TRUMP DIGITAL
TRADING CARDS TODAY.

61
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:46,864
THEY SHOULD BE AT THE TOP OF
EVERYONE'S CHRISTMAS LIST, REALLY.

62
00:03:46,864 --> 00:03:50,298
YOU KNOW, WHY DON'T WE BRING UP
MY CHRISTMAS LIST.

63
00:03:50,298 --> 00:03:51,724
MERRY CHRISTMAS.

64
00:03:51,724 --> 00:03:54,519
I BROUGHT THAT BACK, SAYING
MERRY CHRISTMAS AGAIN.

65
00:03:54,519 --> 00:03:57,432
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO CHRISTIANS

66
00:03:57,432 --> 00:03:59,409
AND TO JEWISH PEOPLE
AS WELL.

67
00:03:59,409 --> 00:04:04,507
MERRY CHRISTMAS.
LIKE CAROL

68
00:04:04,507 --> 00:04:07,893
I WAS VISITED BY THREE GHOSTS.

69
00:04:07,893 --> 00:04:12,369
FOUR IF YOU INCLUDE EPSTEIN.

70
00:04:12,369 --> 00:04:16,433
BUT IT'S CHRISTMAS ALL OVER.
WITH TREE AND TOY AND SANTA.

71
00:04:16,433 --> 00:04:18,533
WE LOVE SANTA,

72
00:04:18,533 --> 00:04:20,214
EXCEPT MAYBE RON DE-SANTA.

73
00:04:20,214 --> 00:04:24,089
HE LOOKS LIKE A ROBLOx.

74
00:04:24,089 --> 00:04:27,961
HE'S NOT MUCH OF A SANTA, IS HE?
HE'S MORE OF A GRINCH.

75
00:04:27,961 --> 00:04:30,957
AND WE ALL REMEMBER GRINCH STOLE
CHRISTMAS,

76
00:04:30,957 --> 00:04:35,969
BUT I GOT IT BACK.
I BROKERED A HISTORIC DEAL WITH
GRINCH AND NETANYAHU

77
00:04:35,969 --> 00:04:40,567
AND WE
AGREED CHRISTMAS WOULD NEVER BE
STOLEN AGAIN,

78
00:04:40,567 --> 00:04:43,765
LIKE HOW THE
WHITES TRY TO STEAL THE NAVI IN AVATAR.

79
00:04:43,765 --> 00:04:46,931
BACK
GOOD

80
00:04:46,931 --> 00:04:48,696
AND YOU LOOK AT SAM WORTHINGTON.

81
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:51,475
HE'S A GREAT FATHER.
HE'S GOT FIVE KIDS NOW.

82
00:04:51,475 --> 00:04:56,458
I'VE GOT FOUR KIDS, FIVE, IF YOU
INCLUDE TIFFANY, BUT

83
00:04:56,962 --> 00:04:58,993
HE'S A
GREAT NAVIDAD.

84
00:04:59,058 --> 00:05:02,745
FELIZ
MERRY CHRISTMAS,

85
00:05:02,746 --> 00:05:06,745
AND LIVE FROM
NEW YORK, IT'S SATURDAY NIGHT!

86
00:07:05,558 --> 00:07:12,332
MUSICAL GUEST LIZZO.

87
00:07:05,558 --> 00:07:10,281
AND YOUR HOST AUSTIN BUTLER.

88
00:07:13,367 --> 00:07:18,315
LADIES

89
00:07:39,107 --> 00:07:42,427
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU, THANK YOU SO MUCH.

90
00:07:42,427 --> 00:07:46,649
I'M SO EXCITED TO BE HERE
HOSTING THE SNL CHRISTMAS SHOW.

91
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:50,348
NOW LAST YEAR'S CHRISTMAS SHOW
WAS CANCELED,

92
00:07:50,348 --> 00:07:51,892
BECAUSE EVERYONE
GOT COVID.

93
00:07:51,892 --> 00:07:55,168
SO THIS YEAR WE CAME UP WITH A
FOOLPROOF PLAN

94
00:07:55,168 --> 00:07:57,069
TO ENSURE NO ONE
WOULD GET COVID.

95
00:07:57,069 --> 00:07:59,530
WE STOPPED TESTING.

96
00:08:00,456 --> 00:08:02,935
I DO WANT TO ADDRESS SOMETHING.

97
00:08:02,935 --> 00:08:06,458
THERE'S PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO SAY
THAT EVER SINCE I PLAYED ELVIS

98
00:08:06,458 --> 00:08:08,306
MY VOICE CHANGED.

99
00:08:08,306 --> 00:08:13,629
IT GOT DEEPER, MORE ELVIS-Y?

100
00:08:13,629 --> 00:08:16,820
THAT'S NOT TRUE.
I'VE ALWAYS SOUNDED LIKE THIS.

101
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:18,131
I CAN PROVE IT.

102
00:08:18,131 --> 00:08:21,473
HERE'S A CLIP FROM AIN'T VIEW I
DID TEN YEARS AGO.

103
00:08:21,473 --> 00:08:24,979
HOW EXCITED ARE YOU TO BE
SEBASTIAN ON THE CARRIE DIARIES?

104
00:08:24,979 --> 00:08:28,717
I'M VERY EXCITED.
IT'S BEEN A GREAT EXPERIENCE SO FAR.

105
00:08:28,717 --> 00:08:30,586
SEE?

106
00:08:34,838 --> 00:08:38,647
YOU KNOW, A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T
KNOW THAT I STARTED ACTING WHEN
I WAS A KID.

107
00:08:38,647 --> 00:08:43,539
AND EVEN BACK THEN I WAS DRAWN
TOWARD INTENSE IMMERSIVE ACTING,

108
00:08:43,539 --> 00:08:48,209
LIKE I WAS 12, AND I WOULD DO
THESE PARTS ON NICKELODEON OR DISNEY SHOWS,

109
00:08:48,209 --> 00:08:52,627
BUT MEANWHILE
STUDYING MOVIES LIKE "RAGING
BULL" AND "TAXI DRIVER",

110
00:08:52,627 --> 00:08:57,552
AND I'D
SHOW UP ON SET AND BE LIKE, "I
DIDN'T SCREW YOUR WIFE"

111
00:08:57,552 --> 00:09:01,776
THE AND
DIRECTOR WOULD BE LIKE, CUT,
AUSTIN.

112
00:09:01,776 --> 00:09:05,580
PUT THE KNIFE DOWN.
YOU'RE SCARING ICARLY.

113
00:09:06,357 --> 00:09:10,774
WHEN I WASN'T ACTING, I WAS A
REALLY SHY KID,

114
00:09:10,774 --> 00:09:12,934
LIKE REALLY SHY.

115
00:09:12,934 --> 00:09:16,292
BUT LUCKILY, MY MOM DECIDED TO
HOME SCHOOL ME AND MY SISTER,

116
00:09:16,292 --> 00:09:18,600
SO
I WAS ALSO WEIRD.

117
00:09:19,461 --> 00:09:22,470
BY THE WAY, MY SISTER IS HERE
TONIGHT.

118
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:24,870
HAPPY BIRTHDAY, ASHLEY!

119
00:09:29,185 --> 00:09:32,165
WE GREW UP IN ANAHEIM, CALIFORNIA.

120
00:09:32,165 --> 00:09:34,596
HENCE THE SOUTHERN ACCENT.

121
00:09:34,596 --> 00:09:38,462
AND SINCE WE HOME SCHOOLED,
SOMETIMES MY MOM WOULD SAY,

122
00:09:38,462 --> 00:09:41,607
WE'RE TAKING THE DAY OFF, AND
WE'RE GOING TO DISNEYLAND,

123
00:09:41,607 --> 00:09:43,408
AND
WE'D BE SO EXCITED.

124
00:09:43,408 --> 00:09:46,403
BUT THEN BY LIKE THE NINTH TIME
THAT SHE DID THAT, I WAS LIKE,

125
00:09:46,403 --> 00:09:49,833
I
DON'T THINK MOM KNOWS HOW TO TEACH.

126
00:09:49,833 --> 00:09:52,194
BUT I LOVE MY MOM.

127
00:09:52,194 --> 00:09:57,104
SOME OF MY FAVORITE MEMORIES
FROM GROWING UP ARE WATCHING SNL
WITH HER.

128
00:09:57,104 --> 00:09:58,547
WE'D WATCH EVERY WEEK.

129
00:09:58,547 --> 00:10:01,012
AND EVEN THOUGH, EVEN THOUGH I
HAD THIS CRIPPLING SHYNESS,

130
00:10:01,012 --> 00:10:05,822
WHEN
I WAS MY MOM, I'D JUST DO
ANYTHING TO MAKE HER LAUGH.

131
00:10:05,822 --> 00:10:09,014
I DO RIDICULOUS FACES AND VOICES,

132
00:10:09,014 --> 00:10:11,866
I DID THIS RIDICULOUS
GOLUM IMPRESSION.

133
00:10:11,867 --> 00:10:15,444
HOBBIT

134
00:10:20,687 --> 00:10:25,269
MY MOM LIKE ALL MOMS WAS A HUGE
GOLUM FAN.

135
00:10:27,347 --> 00:10:31,481
BUT REALLY BEING SILLY WITH HER
IS WHAT BROKE ME OUT OF MY SHELL

136
00:10:31,481 --> 00:10:34,283
AND THE CORE OF WHAT STARTED ME
IN ACTING.

137
00:10:34,283 --> 00:10:38,818
MY MOM IS NO LONGER WITH US.

138
00:10:38,823 --> 00:10:41,848
BUT I BEEN THINKING ABOUT HER A
LOT THIS WEEK,

139
00:10:41,921 --> 00:10:45,085
JUST IMAGINING
HOW PROUD SHE'D BE OF HER SON

140
00:10:45,085 --> 00:10:49,353
WHO USED TO NOT BE ABLE TO ORDER
FOOD FOR MYSELF ON A RESTAURANT

141
00:10:49,353 --> 00:10:52,413
IS NOW STANDING ON THIS STAGE.

142
00:11:04,443 --> 00:11:09,878
AND TONIGHT, JUST KNOW THAT
ANYTIME YOU SEE ME DOING A SILLY
VOICE OR MAKING A FUNNY FACE,

143
00:11:09,878 --> 00:11:11,983
THAT'S FOR YOU, MOM.

144
00:11:14,696 --> 00:11:18,468
WE HAVE GOT A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT.
LIZZO IS HERE.

145
00:11:18,468 --> 00:11:21,467
STICK AROUND.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

146
00:11:29,622 --> 00:11:34,561
>>> HEY, EVERYBODY.

147
00:11:34,561 --> 00:11:43,103
I'M DAN SMATTER, AND WELCOME TO

148
00:11:34,561 --> 00:11:43,103
ANOTHER GREAT ROUND OF THE

149
00:11:34,561 --> 00:11:43,103
PHRASE THAT PAYS, THE GAME THE

150
00:11:43,103 --> 00:11:49,109
THREE PLAYERS WILL FIND THE

151
00:11:43,103 --> 00:11:49,109
MISSING LETTERS IN OUR PUZZLES

152
00:11:43,103 --> 00:11:49,109
FOR BIG, BIG PRIZES.

153
00:11:49,109 --> 00:11:50,543
YES?

154
00:11:49,109 --> 00:11:50,543
SO THIS IS "WHEEL OF FORTUNE"

155
00:11:49,109 --> 00:11:50,543
WITH NO WHEEL?

156
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:57,283
DON'T DO THAT.

157
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:57,283
THAT'S NOT NICE.

158
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:57,283
WE HAVE THREE GREAT CONTESTANTS.

159
00:11:57,283 --> 00:11:59,853
EBY, TROY, AND BETH!

160
00:11:57,283 --> 00:11:59,853
WE DON'T HAVE TIME FOR A FUN

161
00:11:57,283 --> 00:11:59,853
FACT FROM EVERYBODY.

162
00:11:59,853 --> 00:12:02,055
SO WHY DON'T YOU GO DOWN THE

163
00:11:59,853 --> 00:12:02,055
LINE AND TELL EVERYONE YOUR AGES.

164
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:05,592
REALLY?

165
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:05,592
OKAY.

166
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:05,592
36.

167
00:12:05,592 --> 00:12:13,233
34.

168
00:12:05,592 --> 00:12:13,233
NO.

169
00:12:05,592 --> 00:12:13,233
GREAT, WELL, LET'S LOOK AT

170
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:20,674
YOUR FIRST PUZZLE.

171
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:20,674
THE CATEGORY IS SONG, AND EBY,

172
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:20,674
LET'S START WITH YOU.

173
00:12:20,674 --> 00:12:22,809
MY FAVORITE LETTER IS B,

174
00:12:20,674 --> 00:12:22,809
BECAUSE I'M A BAD ONE, BUT I'M

175
00:12:20,674 --> 00:12:22,809
GOING TO SAVE THAT FOR LATER ON

176
00:12:22,809 --> 00:12:31,651
IN THE GAME.

177
00:12:22,809 --> 00:12:31,651
FOR NOW, LET'S JUST GO WITH T.

178
00:12:22,809 --> 00:12:31,651
THERE IS ONE T.

179
00:12:31,651 --> 00:12:37,090
YOU'VE GOT FIVE SECONDS TO SOLVE.

180
00:12:31,651 --> 00:12:37,090
OH, MAMA.

181
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:44,998
MAMA SAID, MAMA WHALE, MAMA.

182
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:44,998
I'M SORRY, EBY, IT'S NOT

183
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:44,998
ANYTHING MAMA.

184
00:12:44,998 --> 00:12:53,340
TROY, YOU'RE UP.

185
00:12:44,998 --> 00:12:53,340
OKAY, IT'S NOT HOTEL

186
00:12:44,998 --> 00:12:53,340
CALIFORNIA, IS IT?

187
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:58,578
WHOA.

188
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:58,578
TROY, I THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING

189
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:58,578
TO GUESS ANOTHER LETTER THERE,

190
00:12:58,578 --> 00:13:01,748
BUT YOU WENT AND SOLVED THE

191
00:12:58,578 --> 00:13:01,748
WHOLE THING, HOW DID YOU DO

192
00:12:58,578 --> 00:13:01,748
THAT?

193
00:13:01,748 --> 00:13:07,320
YEAH, HOW DID YOU DO THAT?

194
00:13:01,748 --> 00:13:07,320
YOU SAID IT WAS A SONG AND

195
00:13:01,748 --> 00:13:07,320
HOTEL CALIFORNIA IS A SONG.

196
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:11,091
SO I THOUGHT MAYBE IT WAS "HOTEL

197
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:11,091
CALIFORNIA."

198
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:11,091
WELL, YOU'VE BANKED A

199
00:13:11,091 --> 00:13:19,065
THOUSAND DOLLARS.

200
00:13:11,091 --> 00:13:19,065
HERE'S OUR NEXT PUZZLE.

201
00:13:11,091 --> 00:13:19,065
THE NEXT CATEGORY IS BOOKS.

202
00:13:19,065 --> 00:13:22,902
AND WE'LL START WITH BETH.

203
00:13:19,065 --> 00:13:22,902
I'VE GOT A LOT OF LETTERS

204
00:13:19,065 --> 00:13:22,902
GOING THROUGH MY MIND RIGHT NOW,

205
00:13:22,902 --> 00:13:25,605
TRYING TO THINK OF A COMMON ONE.

206
00:13:22,902 --> 00:13:25,605
HOW ABOUT X.

207
00:13:22,902 --> 00:13:25,605
SORRY, THERE IS NO X.

208
00:13:25,605 --> 00:13:29,342
YES, THERE IS.

209
00:13:25,605 --> 00:13:29,342
I SEE ONE RIGHT THERE.

210
00:13:25,605 --> 00:13:29,342
THAT JUST COMES UP WHEN YOU

211
00:13:29,342 --> 00:13:33,246
MAKE A WRONG GUESS.

212
00:13:29,342 --> 00:13:33,246
THAT IS A LITTLE CONFUSING.

213
00:13:29,342 --> 00:13:33,246
EBY, YOU'RE UP.

214
00:13:33,246 --> 00:13:43,690
I'M NOT READY TO USE MY B

215
00:13:33,246 --> 00:13:43,690
JUST YET, IS THERE A C?

216
00:13:33,246 --> 00:13:43,690
THERE'S ONE C.

217
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:53,366
YOU'VE GOT FIVE SECONDS.

218
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:53,366
MAMA WON'T, DADDY WILL?

219
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:53,366
DADDY MAMA DID.

220
00:13:53,366 --> 00:13:55,001
MAMA--

221
00:13:53,366 --> 00:13:55,001
I'M SORRY, EBY, TIME'S UP.

222
00:13:53,366 --> 00:13:55,001
I WAS SO CLOSE.

223
00:13:55,001 --> 00:14:00,206
NOT EVEN IN THE BALLPARK.

224
00:13:55,001 --> 00:14:00,206
TROY?

225
00:13:55,001 --> 00:14:00,206
IS IT ALL THE LIGHT WE CANNOT

226
00:14:00,206 --> 00:14:15,455
SEE BY ANTHONY DUER?

227
00:14:00,206 --> 00:14:15,455
AMAZING.

228
00:14:00,206 --> 00:14:15,455
ARE YOU A BOOK LOVER, TROY?

229
00:14:15,455 --> 00:14:17,424
NO, I ACTUALLY HAVEN'T LOVE

230
00:14:15,455 --> 00:14:17,424
THAT, YET.

231
00:14:15,455 --> 00:14:17,424
READ A BOOK?

232
00:14:17,424 --> 00:14:19,726
NO, IT'S ON MY LIST.

233
00:14:17,424 --> 00:14:19,726
OKAY, OKAY.

234
00:14:17,424 --> 00:14:19,726
SOMETHING'S NOT RIGHT HERE.

235
00:14:19,726 --> 00:14:23,063
YOU'RE RIGHT.

236
00:14:19,726 --> 00:14:23,063
WE NEED A NEW PUZZLE.

237
00:14:19,726 --> 00:14:23,063
BECAUSE TROY'S ON A ROLL, AND

238
00:14:23,063 --> 00:14:34,741
TROY, YOUR CATEGORY IS FAMOUS QUOTES.

239
00:14:23,063 --> 00:14:34,741
WELL, MY FAVORITE LETTER IS

240
00:14:34,741 --> 00:14:37,110
B, BECAUSE I'M A BAD ONE.

241
00:14:34,741 --> 00:14:37,110
WHAT?

242
00:14:34,741 --> 00:14:37,110
SO I'M GOING TO SAY B.

243
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:39,379
FIVE SECONDS. WOW.

244
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:39,379
I AM COMPLETELY STUMPED, YEAH.

245
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:44,284
I HAVE NO IDEA.

246
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:44,284
MY MIND IS A TOTAL BLANK.

247
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:44,284
I GIVE UP.

248
00:14:44,284 --> 00:14:50,857
OH, MY GOD.

249
00:14:44,284 --> 00:14:50,857
THAT'S RIGHT!

250
00:14:44,284 --> 00:14:50,857
WHAT?

251
00:14:50,857 --> 00:14:53,827
THAT IS NOT A FAMOUS QUOTE.

252
00:14:50,857 --> 00:14:53,827
YES, IT IS.

253
00:14:50,857 --> 00:14:53,827
IT SAYS BENJAMIN FRANKLIN SAID

254
00:14:53,827 --> 00:15:02,335
IT WHEN HE WAS TRYING TO THINK

255
00:14:53,827 --> 00:15:02,335
OF THE LIGHT BULB.

256
00:14:53,827 --> 00:15:02,335
OKAY, WELL, THAT'S NOT RIGHT.

257
00:15:02,335 --> 00:15:04,571
HE HAS A DEVICE IN HIS ASS LIKE

258
00:15:02,335 --> 00:15:04,571
THAT CHESS PLAYER.

259
00:15:02,335 --> 00:15:04,571
NO, I DON'T.

260
00:15:04,571 --> 00:15:10,043
WE HAVE TIME FOR ONE MORE

261
00:15:04,571 --> 00:15:10,043
CATEGORY, WHICH IS MEDICINE.

262
00:15:04,571 --> 00:15:10,043
WOULD YOU LIKE TO GUESS, BETH OR

263
00:15:10,043 --> 00:15:13,546
WOULD YOU RATHER COMPLAIN?

264
00:15:10,043 --> 00:15:13,546
FINE, FINE, I'LL PLAY, AND I

265
00:15:10,043 --> 00:15:13,546
GOT TO GO WITH MY GUT.

266
00:15:13,546 --> 00:15:17,784
X.

267
00:15:13,546 --> 00:15:17,784
THERE'S NO X.

268
00:15:13,546 --> 00:15:17,784
YES, THERE IS!

269
00:15:17,784 --> 00:15:31,531
NO, THERE ISN'T.

270
00:15:17,784 --> 00:15:31,531
TROY, THE CATEGORY IS MEDICINE.

271
00:15:17,784 --> 00:15:31,531
OH, WOW, I DON'T KNOW

272
00:15:31,531 --> 00:15:33,733
ANYTHING ABOUT THAT.

273
00:15:31,531 --> 00:15:33,733
IS IT ELLEN POMPEO FEELS SUPER

274
00:15:31,531 --> 00:15:33,733
HAPPY AFTER "GREY'S ANATOMY"

275
00:15:33,733 --> 00:15:41,207
EXIT?

276
00:15:33,733 --> 00:15:41,207
HE'S DEFINITELY CHEATING, AND

277
00:15:33,733 --> 00:15:41,207
THERE'S AN X IN THAT.

278
00:15:41,207 --> 00:15:49,683
WHAT?

279
00:15:41,207 --> 00:15:49,683
OH, YEAH, SORRY.

280
00:15:41,207 --> 00:15:49,683
WHO CARES.

281
00:15:49,683 --> 00:15:52,952
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH PHRASE

282
00:15:49,683 --> 00:15:50,952
THAT PAYS.

283
00:15:56,377 --> 00:15:58,842
EPIPHANY

284
00:15:58,842 --> 00:16:02,003
I'M FINE

285
00:16:02,003 --> 00:16:04,787
RICH, YOU KNOW I'M JUST
LOOKING OUT FOR YOU,

286
00:16:04,787 --> 00:16:07,745
NOW COME ON.
GIVE ME WERE YOUR CAR KEYS, YOU
AROUND DRIVE HOME TONIGHT.

287
00:16:07,745 --> 00:16:09,747
ALL RIGHT,

288
00:16:09,747 --> 00:16:12,850
GOOD NIGHT FOR A
WALK HOME ANYHOW.

289
00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:17,389
SAY, RICH, WHAT ARE YOU DOING
OUT HERE DRINKING ON CHRISTMAS
EVE?

290
00:16:17,389 --> 00:16:19,172
AIN'T YOU GOT NO FAMILY?

291
00:16:19,172 --> 00:16:22,225
FAMILY?
WHO NEEDS FAMILY?

292
00:16:22,225 --> 00:16:25,941
WHAT ABOUT THAT GIRL, DENISE,
YOU BEEN GOING AROUND WITH?

293
00:16:25,941 --> 00:16:27,892
WHY AREN'T YOU WITH HER?

294
00:16:28,526 --> 00:16:32,023
CALLED THAT WHOLE THING OFF, JIMBO.

295
00:16:32,023 --> 00:16:35,563
YOU KNOW ME, I'M A LONE WOLF.

296
00:16:35,563 --> 00:16:37,997
THAT'S THE WAY I LIKE IT.

297
00:16:38,709 --> 00:16:41,618
TRYIN' MY BEST, BOSS.

298
00:16:41,618 --> 00:16:44,655
TRYIN' MY BEST.

299
00:16:45,606 --> 00:16:50,779
FAMILY.
WHO WOULD WANT TO GET TIED DOWN
TO SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

300
00:16:50,779 --> 00:16:52,900
NOT ME, I TELL YOU.

301
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:55,551
NO SIRREE.

302
00:17:07,427 --> 00:17:10,690
LOOK AT THEM.
SO MUCH LOVE.

303
00:17:10,733 --> 00:17:14,049
THAT'S WHAT I'VE BEEN AFRAID OF
ALL THESE YEARS.

304
00:17:14,049 --> 00:17:16,063
SO BEAUTIFUL.

305
00:17:17,131 --> 00:17:22,667
STEVEN, THERE IS A MAN
STARING AT US THROUGH OUR WINDOW.

306
00:17:22,667 --> 00:17:25,157
YES, I SEE HIM TOO.

307
00:17:25,157 --> 00:17:26,966
JUST STAY CALM.

308
00:17:26,966 --> 00:17:28,737
ACT LIKE HE ISN'T THERE.

309
00:17:28,737 --> 00:17:31,129
HE'LL LOSE INTEREST, AND HE'LL
LEAVE.

310
00:17:31,129 --> 00:17:34,430
I SPENT MY WHOLE LIFE
RUNNING, AND FOR WHAT?

311
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:38,289
JUST TO BE ALL ALONE ON
CHRISTMAS EVE?

312
00:17:40,004 --> 00:17:42,034
HE ISN'T LEAVING.

313
00:17:42,034 --> 00:17:43,337
JANINE, RELAX.

314
00:17:43,337 --> 00:17:47,647
HOW CAN I RELAX WHEN THERE IS
A PERVERT LURKING IN OUR WINDOW?

315
00:17:47,647 --> 00:17:51,198
HE'S TRYING TO FREAK US OUT, JANINE.
THAT'S WHAT GETS HIM OFF.

316
00:17:51,198 --> 00:17:53,988
DON'T GIVE HIM THE SATISFACTION

317
00:17:53,988 --> 00:17:56,024
OH, I SHOULD HAVE MARRIED
DENISE.

318
00:17:56,024 --> 00:17:59,025
I DROVE HER AWAY.

319
00:18:00,890 --> 00:18:06,001
LOOK AT YOU!
YOU MAKE ME SICK!

320
00:18:06,001 --> 00:18:08,819
YOU RUINED MY LIFE!

321
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:14,662
DAD?
I THINK THE MAN WANTS TO KILL ME.

322
00:18:14,662 --> 00:18:16,645
STEVEN, HE IS SCARING OUR
CHILDREN.

323
00:18:16,645 --> 00:18:18,319
STOP JUST SITTING THERE AND BE A MAN.

324
00:18:18,319 --> 00:18:21,647
- WHAT DO YOU WANT, JANINE?
- I WANT YOU TO PROTECT THIS FAMILY.

325
00:18:21,647 --> 00:18:25,704
GO OUT THERE AND MAKE HIM
LEAVE, DAD, PLEASE!

326
00:18:25,704 --> 00:18:27,801
I'M NOT GOING OUT THERE, ARE
YOU CRAZY?

327
00:18:27,801 --> 00:18:29,852
DON'T LOOK AT HIM.
HE'LL LEAVE.

328
00:18:29,852 --> 00:18:31,302
ARE YOU A COWARD.

329
00:18:31,302 --> 00:18:34,321
WHAT HAVE I DONE?

330
00:18:34,652 --> 00:18:37,945
WASTING YEARS AT THE OFFICE,

331
00:18:37,945 --> 00:18:41,519
WORKING DAY IN AND DAY OUT!

332
00:18:41,519 --> 00:18:45,148
WHAT DO I HAVE TO SHOW FOR IT?

333
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:48,881
FANCY SUIT!

334
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:52,450
SILK TIE!

335
00:18:53,191 --> 00:18:57,102
ARE YOU HAPPY NOW?
HE IS EXPOSING HIMSELF.

336
00:18:57,102 --> 00:18:59,843
WELL, SORRY, I DON'T WANT TO
GET KILLED, JANINE.

337
00:18:59,843 --> 00:19:03,064
YOU ARE PATHETIC, AND THAT'S
WHY I DID WHAT I DID LAST SUMMER.

338
00:19:03,064 --> 00:19:05,117
WHAT HAPPENED LAST SUMMER?

339
00:19:05,117 --> 00:19:09,002
YOUR MOTHER STEPPED OUTSIDE
OF OUR MARRIAGE.

340
00:19:09,002 --> 00:19:10,718
WHAT?

341
00:19:12,789 --> 00:19:15,308
GIVE ME ANOTHER CHANCE AT LIFE.

342
00:19:15,308 --> 00:19:18,873
LET ME START AGAIN AND HAVE A
PERFECT FAMILY, LIKE THIS.

343
00:19:18,873 --> 00:19:20,860
MOM, HOW COULD YOU CHEAT ON
DAD?

344
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:23,719
BECAUSE I HAVEN'T BEEN
ATTRACTED TO HIM IN YEARS!

345
00:19:26,794 --> 00:19:30,095
COME ON, RICH.
GET AHOLD OF YOURSELF.

346
00:19:30,095 --> 00:19:33,270
KENDALL, ARE YOU AN ANGEL?

347
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:36,496
YEAH.
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

348
00:19:36,496 --> 00:19:40,002
YOU GOT TO HELP ME.
I'VE WASTED MY WHOLE LIFE.

349
00:19:40,002 --> 00:19:41,698
OH, MY GOD.

350
00:19:41,698 --> 00:19:43,905
KIDS, DON'T LOOK AT THE MAN,
DON'T LOOK AT THE MAN.

351
00:19:43,905 --> 00:19:46,064
LISTEN TO YOUR MOTHER!

352
00:19:46,064 --> 00:19:48,669
NOW I'LL NEVER HAVE A FAMILY.

353
00:19:48,669 --> 00:19:50,851
I WOULDN'T BE TOO SURE OF
THAT.

354
00:19:50,851 --> 00:19:53,590
RICH?
RICH IS THAT YOU?

355
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:55,223
DENISE.

356
00:19:57,387 --> 00:20:01,384
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
- OH, I WAS JUST PASSING BY.

357
00:20:01,384 --> 00:20:03,562
I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT YOU, RICH.

358
00:20:03,562 --> 00:20:06,367
WELL, DENISE, WOULD YOU
PLEASE TAKE ME BACK?

359
00:20:06,367 --> 00:20:08,442
I'M READY TO HAVE A FAMILY NOW.

360
00:20:08,442 --> 00:20:11,226
OH, RICH, OF COURSE I WILL!

361
00:20:11,226 --> 00:20:15,662
NICE WORK, BOSS.
NICE WORK.

362
00:20:18,981 --> 00:20:20,818
I THINK HE'S LEAVING.

363
00:20:20,818 --> 00:20:22,864
YEAH, YEAH, GET OUT OF HERE,

364
00:20:22,864 --> 00:20:25,326
BEAT IT!
YOU HEAR ME?

365
00:20:25,326 --> 00:20:27,234
SEE, I GOT RID OF HIM.

366
00:20:27,234 --> 00:20:29,019
YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ANYMORE,
YOU'RE SAFE NOW.

367
00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:30,870
WAY TO GO, DAD.
WAY TO GO, DAD.

368
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:33,690
WOW, WHAT A HERO.

369
00:20:50,784 --> 00:20:56,256
YEARN FOR THIS TIME OF YEAR?

370
00:20:50,784 --> 00:20:56,256
THE SWEET TREAT THEY ASK SANTA

371
00:20:50,784 --> 00:20:56,256
FOR?

372
00:20:56,256 --> 00:21:00,927
THE CONFECTION THEY DREAM OF

373
00:20:56,256 --> 00:21:00,927
MOST OF ALL?

374
00:20:56,256 --> 00:21:00,927
IS IT CANDY CANES?

375
00:21:00,927 --> 00:21:12,539
HERSHEY KISSES? NO, IT'S

376
00:21:00,927 --> 00:21:12,539
MARZIPAN!

377
00:21:00,927 --> 00:21:12,539
YAY!

378
00:21:12,539 --> 00:21:15,075
THAT'S RIGHT, MARZIPAN.

379
00:21:12,539 --> 00:21:15,075
THE MOSTLY ALMOND, ALMOST CANDY

380
00:21:12,539 --> 00:21:15,075
FROM GERMANY, WITH THE FLAVOR OF

381
00:21:15,075 --> 00:21:18,078
NUTS BUT THE TEXTURE OF NUTS.

382
00:21:15,075 --> 00:21:18,078
AND WHAT WAS HIS NAME?

383
00:21:18,078 --> 00:21:33,693
MARZIPAN.

384
00:21:18,078 --> 00:21:33,693
MARZIPAN.

385
00:21:18,078 --> 00:21:33,693
MARZIPAN.

386
00:21:33,693 --> 00:21:39,165
IT COMES IN ANY SHAPE THAT

387
00:21:33,693 --> 00:21:39,165
YOU CAN THINK OF AS LONG AS YOU

388
00:21:33,693 --> 00:21:39,165
THINK OF BANANA.

389
00:21:39,165 --> 00:21:45,572
MINE'S AN APPLE.

390
00:21:39,165 --> 00:21:45,572
MINE'S A PEAR.

391
00:21:39,165 --> 00:21:45,572
MINE'S AN UNSHAPED LOG.

392
00:21:45,572 --> 00:21:53,613
ME TOO.

393
00:21:45,572 --> 00:21:53,613
MINE IS, YAAAAAA.

394
00:21:45,572 --> 00:21:53,613
THAT'S RIGHT.

395
00:21:53,613 --> 00:21:58,551
THE CHILD'S CHOICE.

396
00:21:53,613 --> 00:21:58,551
THE CANDY WITH AS MUCH PROTEIN

397
00:21:53,613 --> 00:21:58,551
AS A BITE OF STEAK, BUT DON'T

398
00:21:58,551 --> 00:22:03,590
TAKE IT FROM ME.

399
00:21:58,551 --> 00:22:03,590
TAKE IT FROM THESE STRANGE

400
00:21:58,551 --> 00:22:03,590
BRITISH CHILDREN.

401
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:11,364
I LOVE MARZIPAN.

402
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:11,364
YOU CAN ALMOST TASTE THE TASTE.

403
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:11,364
I USED TO THINK THAT THE BEST

404
00:22:11,364 --> 00:22:16,269
CANDY WAS CIRCUS PEANUTS, BUT

405
00:22:11,364 --> 00:22:16,269
NOW I KNOW IT'S MARZIPAN.

406
00:22:11,364 --> 00:22:16,269
IF A STRANGER SAID TO ME,

407
00:22:16,269 --> 00:22:21,608
COME IN MY CAR, I'VE GOT CANDY,

408
00:22:16,269 --> 00:22:21,608
I'D SAY NO!

409
00:22:16,269 --> 00:22:21,608
BUT IF THEY SAID I'VE GOT

410
00:22:21,608 --> 00:22:33,553
MARZIPAN, I'D SAY ABDUCT ME,

411
00:22:21,608 --> 00:22:33,553
BABY!

412
00:22:21,608 --> 00:22:33,553
AS SOON AS YOU FINISH ONE,

413
00:22:33,553 --> 00:22:40,527
YOU'LL WANT ANOTHER, AND THAT'S

414
00:22:33,553 --> 00:22:40,527
PROBABLY ENOUGH.

415
00:22:33,553 --> 00:22:40,527
JUST REMEMBER, DON'T EAT IT

416
00:22:40,527 --> 00:22:42,962
WITHIN 12 HOURS OF GOING TO

417
00:22:40,527 --> 00:22:42,962
SLEEP OR AFTER 12 HOURS OF

418
00:22:40,527 --> 00:22:42,962
WAKING UP.

419
00:22:42,962 --> 00:22:44,898
AND NOW, CHILDREN, WOULD YOU

420
00:22:42,962 --> 00:22:44,898
LIKE TO SEE OUR EXPERT CHEF

421
00:22:42,962 --> 00:22:44,898
MAKING A FRESH BATCH?

422
00:22:44,898 --> 00:22:47,334
ME!

423
00:22:44,898 --> 00:22:47,334
I'M OLDEST.

424
00:22:44,898 --> 00:22:47,334
HELLO THERE, I'M MAKING

425
00:22:47,334 --> 00:22:53,106
MARZIPAN.

426
00:22:47,334 --> 00:22:53,106
IS THE RECIPE A SECRET?

427
00:22:47,334 --> 00:22:53,106
YES.

428
00:22:53,106 --> 00:22:57,711
IS IT JUST ALMONDS?

429
00:22:53,106 --> 00:22:57,711
YES.

430
00:22:53,106 --> 00:22:57,711
DO YOU MUSH THEM UP?

431
00:22:57,711 --> 00:23:06,786
YES.

432
00:22:57,711 --> 00:23:06,786
AND THEN IT'S MARZIPAN?

433
00:22:57,711 --> 00:23:06,786
YES!

434
00:23:06,786 --> 00:23:11,958
WAIT, LET'S SEE IF THE BATCH

435
00:23:06,786 --> 00:23:11,958
IS READY!

436

MM.

437
00:23:11,958 --> 00:23:14,060
YUCK, IT'S PERFECT!

438
00:23:11,958 --> 00:23:14,060
ALL DONE!

439
00:23:11,958 --> 00:23:14,060
AND, REMEMBER, IT MUST BE

440
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:19,733
REFRIGERATED AND CONSUMED WITHIN

441
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:19,733
50 YEARS.

442
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:19,733
IT WILL NEVER LAST THAT LONG.

443
00:23:19,733 --> 00:23:27,607
NOW LOOK WHAT WE HAVE, CHILDREN.

444
00:23:19,733 --> 00:23:27,607
IS THAT WHAT I THINK IT IS?

445
00:23:27,607 --> 00:23:35,615

00:33:58,685 --> 00:34:03,004
A COLLECTION OF DIGITAL NFT
TRADING CARDS DEPICTING HIM IN
VARIOUS COSTUMES

657
00:34:03,004 --> 00:34:05,543
INCLUDING COWBOY, SUPER HERO

658
00:34:05,543 --> 00:34:10,223
AND MOST
UNBELIEVABLE, GUY WHO DIDN'T
DODGE THE DRAFT.

659
00:34:11,082 --> 00:34:15,634
I'M HONESTLY JUST RELIEVED THAT
HE'S WEARING AN AMERICAN
MILITARY UNIFORM.

660
00:34:16,715 --> 00:34:22,400
IT'S SUCH A FUNNY MOVE TO GET
INTO NFTs AFTER THE WHOLE MARKET
JUST CRASHED.

661
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:25,929
IT'S LIKE GETTING INTO KANYE NOW,

662
00:34:26,312 --> 00:34:29,797
WHICH TRUMP ALSO KIND OF
DID.

663
00:34:30,583 --> 00:34:35,575
>>> SAM BANKMAN-FRIED

664
00:34:35,575 --> 00:34:37,996
WAS ARRESTED ON FRAUD CHARGES IN THE
BAHAMAS,

665
00:34:37,996 --> 00:34:41,408
I'M GOING TO GUESS,
WHILE SWIMMING IN A TEE SHIRT.

666
00:34:42,050 --> 00:34:47,076
PROSECUTORS ALLEGE THAT
BANKMAN-FRIED TOOK FUNDS FROM
FTX CUSTOMERS

667
00:34:47,076 --> 00:34:49,292
TO MAKE LARGE
POLITICAL DONATIONS.

668
00:34:49,292 --> 00:34:51,399
THAT MONEY WILL NOW BE USED TO MAKE SURE

669
00:34:51,399 --> 00:34:55,035
THE CAMERAS OUTSIDE
HIS JAIL CELL AREN'T WORKING.

670
00:34:56,084 --> 00:35:01,397
PRESIDENT BIDEN, SEEN HERE,
GIVING THE EULOGY AT A PIMP'S FUNERAL,

671
00:35:02,714 --> 00:35:05,589
FORMALLY APPROVED NEW LEGISLATION

672
00:35:05,589 --> 00:35:09,933
TO GUARANTEE FEDERAL PROTECTIONS
FOR SAME-SEX AND INTERRACIAL MARRIAGES,

673
00:35:09,933 --> 00:35:15,129
IN A
SIGNING CEREMONY HELD OVER MY
GRANDPA'S DEAD BODY.

674
00:35:15,974 --> 00:35:19,155
GEORGIA REPRESENTATIVE,
MARJORIE TAYLOR GREEN,

675
00:35:19,155 --> 00:35:23,427
WHO LET'S
FACE IT, IS ABSOLUTELY MY TYPE.

676
00:35:23,427 --> 00:35:28,186
COMPLAINED THAT PEOPLE CAN BUY
BUTT PLUGS AT TARGET

677
00:35:28,186 --> 00:35:32,121
AND THAT
THEY MELT AND ARE SHAPED LIKE SANTA.

678
00:35:34,597 --> 00:35:38,489
THIS WEEK, BIDEN ALSO HOSTED
LEADERS OF AFRICAN COUNTRIES
AT WHITE HOUSE

679
00:35:38,489 --> 00:35:40,811
FOR
THE U.S. AFRICAN BUSINESS FORUM.

680
00:35:40,811 --> 00:35:43,432
COINCIDENTALLY, U.S. AFRICAN BUSINESS FORUM

681
00:35:43,432 --> 00:35:46,898
IS WHAT THEY CALL
WEEKEND UPDATE IN NIGERIA.

682
00:35:52,139 --> 00:36:02,462
WELL, IT IS CHRISTMAS TIME, A

683
00:35:52,318 --> 00:36:02,462
TIME WHEN NICE CHILDREN GET

684
00:35:52,318 --> 00:36:02,462
PRESENTS, NOT PRESIDENTS, NICE

685
00:36:02,462 --> 00:36:10,236
CHILDREN GET PRESENTS FROM SANTA

686
00:36:02,462 --> 00:36:10,236
AND BAD CHILDREN GET A VISIT

687
00:36:02,462 --> 00:36:10,236
FROM KRAMPUS, HERE TO VISIT US

688
00:36:10,236 --> 00:36:19,646
IS KRAMPUS.

689
00:36:10,236 --> 00:36:19,646
HEY, MICHAEL, HEY, COLIN.

690
00:36:10,236 --> 00:36:19,646
HEY, KRAMPUS.

691
00:36:19,646 --> 00:36:26,052
SO HOW ARE YOU DOING?

692
00:36:19,646 --> 00:36:26,052
I'M GOOD.

693
00:36:19,646 --> 00:36:26,052
I'M A LITTLE BURNT OUT.

694
00:36:26,052 --> 00:36:33,927
I'M SO WRAPPED UP IN THIS JOB.

695
00:36:26,052 --> 00:36:33,927
EVERY YEAR I RISE FROM HELL, RUN

696
00:36:26,052 --> 00:36:33,927
AROUND, KIDNAP ALL THE NAUGHTY

697
00:36:33,927 --> 00:36:44,270
CHILDREN, AND I JUST GO HOME AND

698
00:36:33,927 --> 00:36:44,270
CHECK OUT.

699
00:36:33,927 --> 00:36:44,270
COLIN, YOU EVER WATCH FIVE HOURS

700
00:36:44,270 --> 00:36:50,243
STRAIGHT OF TV AND YOU HAVE

701
00:36:44,270 --> 00:36:50,243
EATEN 40 KIDS.

702
00:36:44,270 --> 00:36:50,243
WAIT, YOU EAT THE KIDS?

703
00:36:50,243 --> 00:36:54,481
THAT'S FINE.

704
00:36:50,243 --> 00:36:54,481
WHAT AM I DOING?

705
00:36:50,243 --> 00:36:54,481
I JUST TURNED 936.

706
00:36:54,481 --> 00:37:00,153
THESE SHOULD BE THE BEST YEARS

707
00:36:54,481 --> 00:37:00,153
OF MY LIFE.

708
00:36:54,481 --> 00:37:00,153
THEN I THINK OF MY DAD AT MY

709
00:37:00,153 --> 00:37:04,424
AGE, HE WAS ONE OF THE ORIGINAL

710
00:37:00,153 --> 00:37:04,424
GAYS AT SODOM, AND HE WAS

711
00:37:00,153 --> 00:37:04,424
MARRIED!

712
00:37:04,424 --> 00:37:08,094
THAT SOUNDS LIKE A LOT OF PRESSURE.

713
00:37:04,424 --> 00:37:08,094
YOU KNOW, THERE'S THIS GREAT

714
00:37:08,094 --> 00:37:12,165
QUOTE ABOUT SHAME.

715
00:37:08,094 --> 00:37:12,165
IT'S THE FEELING THAT PEOPLE ARE

716
00:37:08,094 --> 00:37:12,165
SAYING HURTFUL THINGS ABOUT YOU

717
00:37:12,165 --> 00:37:23,476
WHEN YOU LEAVE THE ROOM, AND I

718
00:37:12,165 --> 00:37:23,476
WAS LIKE, WOW.

719
00:37:12,165 --> 00:37:23,476
LIKE THAT REALLY RESONATED WITH

720
00:37:23,476 --> 00:37:26,780
ME.

721
00:37:23,476 --> 00:37:26,780
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

722
00:37:23,476 --> 00:37:26,780
WHO'S SHAMING YOU?

723
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:34,220
LIKE PEOPLE IN BAVARIA DRESS

724
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:34,220
UP LIKE ME, YOU'RE MAKING FUN OF

725
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:34,220
MY BODY.

726
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:37,524
YOU'RE MAKING FUN OF MY LIVELIHOOD.

727
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:37,524
AND I'M SORRY.

728
00:37:37,524 --> 00:37:42,529
MY CULTURE IS NOT YOUR COSTUME.

729
00:37:37,524 --> 00:37:42,529
BUT THAT'S WHAT WE DO.

730
00:37:37,524 --> 00:37:42,529
WE DON'T PROTECT QUEER VOICES IN

731
00:37:42,529 --> 00:38:03,883
THIS COUNTRY.

732
00:37:42,529 --> 00:38:03,883
I'M SICK.

733
00:37:42,529 --> 00:38:03,883
OH, I HESITATE TO SAY HORNY,

734
00:38:03,883 --> 00:38:11,458
BUT I DO FEEL THAT'S

735
00:38:03,883 --> 00:38:11,458
APPROPRIATE.

736
00:38:03,883 --> 00:38:11,458
YOU'RE QUEER?

737
00:38:11,458 --> 00:38:21,668
YEAH, I'M A DEMON, I'M QUEER.

738
00:38:11,458 --> 00:38:21,668
THERE'S THIS GREAT LINE,

739
00:38:11,458 --> 00:38:21,668
SHE SAYS THEM HO ACCUSATIONS

740
00:38:21,668 --> 00:38:23,403
WEAK, THEM BITCH ACCUSATIONS TRUE.

741
00:38:21,668 --> 00:38:23,403
AND THAT REALLY RESONATED WITH

742
00:38:23,403 --> 00:38:26,673
ME.

743
00:38:23,403 --> 00:38:26,673
BECAUSE, YEAH, WHAT I DO ISN'T

744
00:38:23,403 --> 00:38:26,673
GREAT, BUT IT'S LIKE MY

745
00:38:26,673 --> 00:38:31,444
THERAPIST ALWAYS SAYS, KRAMPUS,

746
00:38:26,673 --> 00:38:31,444
YOUR JOB IS TO PUNISH CHILDREN,

747
00:38:26,673 --> 00:38:31,444
NOT YOURSELF.

748
00:38:31,444 --> 00:38:39,486
AND WHO IS YOUR THERAPIST?

749
00:38:31,444 --> 00:38:39,486
GHISLAINE MAXWELL. OH.

750
00:38:39,486 --> 00:38:45,258
WOW.

751
00:38:39,486 --> 00:38:45,258
SHE'S YOUR THERAPIST?

752
00:38:39,486 --> 00:38:45,258
BECAUSE SHE'S NOT DEAD.

753
00:38:45,258 --> 00:38:52,565
SHE COMMUTES, COLIN.

754
00:38:45,258 --> 00:38:52,565
IT'S HARD, YOU KNOW, I'M RUNNING

755
00:38:45,258 --> 00:38:52,565
AROUND CENTRAL EUROPE ON FOOT BY

756
00:38:52,565 --> 00:38:57,437
MYSELF AND SELF-REPORTING TO

757
00:38:52,565 --> 00:38:57,437
EVERY VILLAGE.

758
00:38:52,565 --> 00:38:57,437
MEANWHILE, I GREW UP SOLIDLY

759
00:38:57,437 --> 00:39:01,107
MIDDLE CLASS.

760
00:38:57,437 --> 00:39:01,107
MY MOTHER WAS A TEACHER.

761
00:38:57,437 --> 00:39:01,107
WHAT DID SHE TEACH?

762
00:39:01,107 --> 00:39:11,384
HOW TO EAT KIDS.

763
00:39:01,107 --> 00:39:11,384
SO AS MUCH AS I WANT TO QUIET

764
00:39:01,107 --> 00:39:11,384
QUIT I SHOW UP, AND I DO THE

765
00:39:11,384 --> 00:39:16,656
WORK.

766
00:39:11,384 --> 00:39:16,656
BECAUSE, I LIKE MYSELF.

767
00:39:11,384 --> 00:39:16,656
MAYBE YOU SHOULD TRY IT, MY

768
00:39:16,656 --> 00:39:20,727
FRIEND.

769
00:39:16,656 --> 00:39:20,727
WATER'S WARM.

770
00:39:16,656 --> 00:39:20,727
THERE'S A QUOTE ABOUT

771
00:39:20,727 --> 00:39:32,939
SELF-ACCEPTANCE, HE

772
00:39:20,727 --> 00:39:32,939
GHISLAINE IS A BAD THERAPIST.

773
00:39:20,727 --> 00:39:32,939
I'M FALLING APART.

774
00:39:34,074 --> 00:39:46,086
>>> U.S. SCIENTISTS HAVE MADE A

775
00:39:34,074 --> 00:39:46,086
DISCOVERY THAT THEY HOPE WILL

776
00:39:34,074 --> 00:39:46,086
LEAD TO THE REMIX OF IGNITION.

777
00:39:46,086 --> 00:39:55,395
>>> A NEW STUDY HAS FOUND THAT

778
00:39:46,086 --> 00:39:55,395
USING SCREENS TO STOP A CHILD'S

779
00:39:46,086 --> 00:39:55,395
TANTRUMS CAN HARM THEIR ABILITY

780
00:39:55,395 --> 00:40:06,139
TO CONTROL THEIR EMOTIONS.

781
00:39:55,395 --> 00:40:06,139
THE STUDY IS CALLED "ELON MUSK."

782
00:39:55,395 --> 00:40:06,139
>>> THEY ARE WORRIED THAT A

783
00:40:06,139 --> 00:40:15,915
RIVALRY BETWEEN DONALD TRUMP AND

784
00:40:06,139 --> 00:40:15,915
RON DeSANTIS COULD LEAD TO A

785
00:40:15,915 --> 00:40:18,251
CIVIL WAR, WHICH IS PERFECT,

786
00:40:15,915 --> 00:40:18,251
BECAUSE THEY ALREADY HAVE THE FLAGS.

787
00:40:28,728 --> 00:40:34,334
WEEK WITH OUR FAMILIES, AND HERE

788
00:40:28,728 --> 00:40:34,334
TO TALK ABOUT IT IS MY GREAT

789
00:40:28,728 --> 00:40:34,334
AUNT PAT.

790
00:40:34,334 --> 00:40:39,606
HI, AUNT PAT.

791
00:40:34,334 --> 00:40:39,606
HI, HONEY, YOU LOOK DASHING

792
00:40:34,334 --> 00:40:39,606
AS EVER.

793
00:40:39,606 --> 00:40:44,344
AND MY, HOW IT'S NICE TO BE BACK

794
00:40:39,606 --> 00:40:44,344
ON UPDATE.

795
00:40:39,606 --> 00:40:44,344
YEAH, YEAH, EXCEPT YOU'VE

796
00:40:44,344 --> 00:40:49,149
NEVER BEEN HERE BEFORE.

797
00:40:44,344 --> 00:40:49,149
COLIN, WHERE ARE YOUR

798
00:40:44,344 --> 00:40:49,149
MANNERS?

799
00:40:49,149 --> 00:40:53,586
NEVER, EVER QUESTION A LADY,

800
00:40:49,149 --> 00:40:53,586
ESPECIALLY AT CHRISTMAS TIME.

801
00:40:49,149 --> 00:40:53,586
I'M SO SORRY.

802
00:40:53,586 --> 00:40:57,624
WELCOME BACK TO UPDATE.

803
00:40:53,586 --> 00:40:57,624
THANK YOU.

804
00:40:53,586 --> 00:40:57,624
THANK YOU.

805
00:40:57,624 --> 00:41:08,635
NOW, COLIN, MANNERS ARE THE GLUE

806
00:40:57,624 --> 00:41:08,635
THAT HOLD SOCIETY TOGETHER.

807
00:40:57,624 --> 00:41:08,635
YOU KNOW YOU DIDN'T EVEN GREET

808
00:41:08,635 --> 00:41:10,570
ME CORRECTLY?

809
00:41:08,635 --> 00:41:10,570
I DIDN'T?

810
00:41:08,635 --> 00:41:10,570
NO, YOU SEE AT CHRISTMAS TIME

811
00:41:10,570 --> 00:41:13,073
YOU ALWAYS GREET YOUR ELDERS

812
00:41:10,570 --> 00:41:13,073
WITH A KISS ON THE LIPS.

813
00:41:10,570 --> 00:41:13,073
WHY, WHY THE LIPS?

814
00:41:13,073 --> 00:41:23,750
MANNERS, COLIN.

815
00:41:13,073 --> 00:41:23,750
OOH, MY APOLOGIES, MS.

816
00:41:23,750 --> 00:41:31,091
SCARLETT.

817
00:41:23,750 --> 00:41:31,091
I'M YOUR AUNT, BOY.

818
00:41:23,750 --> 00:41:31,091
I AM GOING TO NEED A DRINK AFTER

819
00:41:31,091 --> 00:41:42,802
THAT.

820
00:41:31,091 --> 00:41:42,802
WHERE'S MY BUTLER?

821
00:41:42,802 --> 00:41:44,738
MIKEY DAY!

822
00:41:42,802 --> 00:41:44,738
YES, PAT.

823
00:41:42,802 --> 00:41:44,738
MIKEY, YOU'RE BUTLERING FOR

824
00:41:44,738 --> 00:41:46,573
MY AUNT PAT?

825
00:41:44,738 --> 00:41:46,573
YEAH, I'M NOT IN A LOT OF

826
00:41:44,738 --> 00:41:46,573
SKETCHES, AND I NEED MONEY FOR

827
00:41:46,573 --> 00:41:58,284
CHRISTMAS.

828
00:41:46,573 --> 00:41:58,284
WHAT CAN I GET FOR YOU.

829
00:41:46,573 --> 00:41:58,284
I'LL TAKE A SLOW GIN JUICE.

830
00:41:58,284 --> 00:42:09,295
SORRY A SLOW GIN JIZ?

831
00:41:58,284 --> 00:42:09,295
YES, A SLOW GIN JIZ.

832
00:41:58,284 --> 00:42:09,295
ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU, MIKEY DAY.

833
00:42:09,295 --> 00:42:11,164
THANK YOU.

834
00:42:09,295 --> 00:42:11,164
AND THAT WILL BE ALL, MIKEY DAY.

835
00:42:11,164 --> 00:42:15,669
THAT WILL BE ALL.

836
00:42:11,164 --> 00:42:15,669
MIKEY, THAT WILL BE ALL.

837
00:42:11,164 --> 00:42:15,669
YOU CAN GO NOW.

838
00:42:15,669 --> 00:42:22,509
AUNT PAT, AUNT PAT.

839
00:42:15,669 --> 00:42:22,509
DID YOU JUST TAP HIS CROTCH?

840
00:42:15,669 --> 00:42:22,509
YOU MEAN A BOUF ON THE GOOCH?

841
00:42:22,509 --> 00:42:30,083
YOU KNOW GASPY LOVES TO BE

842
00:42:22,509 --> 00:42:30,083
GREETED WITH A BOUF ON THE GOOCH.

843
00:42:30,083 --> 00:42:39,626
GATSBY IS A FICTIONAL CHARACTER.

844
00:42:30,083 --> 00:42:39,626
COLIN, I JUST SAW ON YOUR

845
00:42:39,626 --> 00:42:44,731
MONITOR, MY SLOW GIN JIZ HAS

846
00:42:39,626 --> 00:42:44,731
ALMOST COMPLETELY WIPED AWAY MY

847
00:42:39,626 --> 00:42:44,731
LIP STAIN.

848
00:42:44,731 --> 00:42:47,100
MIKEY DAY?

849
00:42:44,731 --> 00:42:47,100
YES, PAT. YES.

850
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:49,936
LIPSTICK.

851
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:49,936
YOU APPLY IT TO YOUR LIPS,

852
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:49,936
THEN YOU PUT YOUR LIPS ON MINE.

853
00:42:49,936 --> 00:42:57,677
OH, MIKEY, YOU REALLY DON'T

854
00:42:49,936 --> 00:42:57,677
HAVE TO.

855
00:42:49,936 --> 00:42:57,677
COLIN, MANNERS, COLIN.

856
00:42:57,677 --> 00:43:05,218
IT'S LIKE BREAKING APART.

857
00:42:57,677 --> 00:43:05,218
ALL RIGHT, MIKEY DAY.

858
00:42:57,677 --> 00:43:05,218
ALL RIGHT.

859
00:43:05,218 --> 00:43:09,489
LOOKS LIKE WE BOTH HAD SMOKED

860
00:43:05,218 --> 00:43:09,489
SALMON FOR DINNER. MM.

861
00:43:09,489 --> 00:43:15,061
THANK YOU. OKAY.

862
00:43:09,489 --> 00:43:15,061
OKAY, THANK YOU, MIKEY DAY.

863
00:43:15,061 --> 00:43:24,804
YOU GAVE HIM ONE DOLLAR?

864
00:43:15,061 --> 00:43:24,804
THAT WILL BE ALL, MIKEY DAY.

865
00:43:15,061 --> 00:43:24,804
THAT WILL BE ALL.

866
00:43:24,804 --> 00:43:29,442
AUNT PAT, NONE OF THIS IS ETIQUETTE.

867
00:43:24,804 --> 00:43:29,442
IT SEEMS LIKE YOU JUST WANT TO

868
00:43:29,442 --> 00:43:36,950
KISS AND FONDLE MOVIE STARS.

869
00:43:29,442 --> 00:43:36,950
COLIN!

870
00:43:29,442 --> 00:43:36,950
MOVIE STARS?

871
00:43:36,950 --> 00:43:47,627
YOU BOYS AREN'T MOVIE STARS.

872
00:43:36,950 --> 00:43:47,627
YOU'RE TV MUPPETS.

873
00:43:36,950 --> 00:43:47,627
AUNT PAT.

874
00:43:47,627 --> 00:43:58,638
AUNT PAT, YOU'RE OUT OF CONTROL.

875
00:43:47,627 --> 00:43:58,638
NO, I'M STAYIN' HERE, BECAUSE

876
00:43:47,627 --> 00:43:58,638
I HAVE A GIFT FOR YOU.

877
00:43:58,638 --> 00:44:05,378
MIKEY DAY?

878
00:43:58,638 --> 00:44:05,378
MIKEY.

879
00:43:58,638 --> 00:44:05,378
I WANT TO GIVE COLIN HIS

880
00:44:05,378 --> 00:44:14,454
CHRISTMAS GIFT, BUT HIS LIPS ARE

881
00:44:05,378 --> 00:44:14,454
A LITTLE DRY.

882
00:44:05,378 --> 00:44:14,454
MIKEY, DO WHAT YOU DO.

883
00:44:14,454 --> 00:44:19,726
THAT'S OKAY, I PUT ON A

884
00:44:14,454 --> 00:44:19,726
LITTLE LIPSTICK BEFORE I CAME

885
00:44:14,454 --> 00:44:19,726
OUT HERE.

886
00:44:19,726 --> 00:44:23,930
THAT'S OKAY. OOH. YES.

887
00:44:23,930 --> 00:44:30,537
THANK YOU.

888
00:44:23,930 --> 00:44:30,537
THANK YOU.

889
00:44:23,930 --> 00:44:30,537

THANK YOU, MIKEY DAY.

895
00:44:37,610 --> 00:44:46,219

YOU LOOK ADORABLE.

I LOVE YOUR SANTA HAT.

918
00:45:42,976 --> 00:45:49,249
IT'S COVERING UP A GIANT OPEN

919
00:45:49,249 --> 00:45:53,086
WOUND.

920
00:45:49,249 --> 00:45:53,086
I GOT A LITTLE SCALPED.

921
00:45:49,249 --> 00:45:53,086
YOU GOT SCALPED?

922
00:45:53,086 --> 00:45:57,724
I FELL ASLEEP ON AN ESCALATOR.

923
00:45:53,086 --> 00:45:57,724
IT IS JUST A MESS UP HERE.

924
00:45:57,724 --> 00:46:03,263
BUT AT LEAST NOW THE CURTAINS

925
00:45:57,724 --> 00:46:03,263
MATCH THE DRAPES.

926
00:45:57,724 --> 00:46:03,263
YUCK, CATHY ANNE.

927
00:46:03,263 --> 00:46:14,507
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

928
00:46:03,263 --> 00:46:14,507
YOU GO TO THE WORST PRAISE PLACE

929
00:46:14,507 --> 00:46:18,745
AND YOU FIGURE IT OUT.

930
00:46:14,507 --> 00:46:18,745
WHAT'S GOT YOUR GOOSE

931
00:46:14,507 --> 00:46:18,745
TONIGHT?

932
00:46:18,745 --> 00:46:24,551
GLAD YOU ASKED, YOU SEXY

933
00:46:18,745 --> 00:46:24,551
PIECE OF CRAP.

934
00:46:18,745 --> 00:46:24,551
I'M HERE TO SAY GOOD-BYE.

935
00:46:24,551 --> 00:46:29,055
WHERE YOU GOIN'?

936
00:46:24,551 --> 00:46:29,055
TURNS OUT, PRISON.

937
00:46:24,551 --> 00:46:29,055
PRISON?

938
00:46:29,055 --> 00:46:39,966
THE THINGS I'VE ADMITTED TO

939
00:46:29,055 --> 00:46:39,966
YOU ADDED UP.

940
00:46:29,055 --> 00:46:39,966
DESTRUCTION OF PROPERTY.

941
00:46:39,966 --> 00:46:43,903
METH, METH AND CRACK.

942
00:46:39,966 --> 00:46:43,903
SONIC ATTACKS.

943
00:46:39,966 --> 00:46:43,903
WHAT THE RUSSIANS DO WITH

944
00:46:43,903 --> 00:46:50,610
SOUND WAVES?

945
00:46:43,903 --> 00:46:50,610
NO, I DID AN UPPER DECKER AT

946
00:46:43,903 --> 00:46:50,610
THE SOFT SERVER AT SONIC.

947
00:46:50,610 --> 00:46:56,282
BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE DID END UP

948
00:46:50,610 --> 00:46:56,282
WITH PRETTY BAD HEADACHES.

949
00:46:50,610 --> 00:46:56,282
BUT IT WORKED OUT OKAY, BECAUSE

950
00:46:56,282 --> 00:47:04,024
I MADE A PLEA DEAL, I ENDED UP

951
00:46:56,282 --> 00:47:04,024
GETTING LIFE IN PRISON

952
00:46:56,282 --> 00:47:04,024
THAT'S A BAD DEAL.

953
00:47:04,024 --> 00:47:10,063
THEY WANTED TO KILL ME.

954
00:47:04,024 --> 00:47:10,063
THEY BROUGHT THE CHAIR BACK AND

955
00:47:04,024 --> 00:47:10,063
HAD ME TRY THE HAT ON AND

956
00:47:10,063 --> 00:47:15,735
EVERYTHING.

957
00:47:10,063 --> 00:47:15,735
I'M SORRY YOU'RE GOING TO PRISON.

958
00:47:15,735 --> 00:47:19,439
I'M NOT.

959
00:47:15,735 --> 00:47:19,439
IT'S GOING TO GIVE ME

960
00:47:15,735 --> 00:47:19,439
MUCH-NEEDED STABILITY.

961
00:47:19,439 --> 00:47:24,411
AND I'M NOT TOO SCARED.

962
00:47:19,439 --> 00:47:24,411
I GOT FRIENDS ON THE INSIDE.

963
00:47:19,439 --> 00:47:24,411
THEY SEEM TO BE DOING OKAY.

964
00:47:24,411 --> 00:47:28,648
AND IT'S OKAY, YOU KNOW.

965
00:47:24,411 --> 00:47:28,648
LY A GOOD RUN, I MINE, I MET YOU.

966
00:47:28,648 --> 00:47:33,219
WE FELL IN LOVE, WE MADE A SEX TAPE.

CAUGHT ON MY RING CAM

969
00:47:33,219 --> 00:47:46,066
MASTURBATING IS NOT A SEX TAPE.

970

WHOA, CATHY ANNE, YOU LOOK SO

974
00:47:51,471 --> 00:47:54,908
DIFFERENT.

975
00:47:51,471 --> 00:47:54,908
WHAT HAPPENED?

976
00:47:51,471 --> 00:47:54,908
OKAY, EXCUSE ME, LOOK AT YOU.

977
00:47:54,908 --> 00:48:02,248
HAVE YOU SEEN YOU NOW VERSUS

978
00:47:54,908 --> 00:48:02,248
WHEN YOU STARTED, MR. SILVER

979
00:47:54,908 --> 00:48:02,248
FOX?

980
00:48:02,248 --> 00:48:06,286
TURNING INTO OBAMA.

981
00:48:02,248 --> 00:48:06,286
ALL RIGHT, THAT'S FAIR, FAIR.

982
00:48:02,248 --> 00:48:06,286
LISTEN, LISTEN.

983
00:48:06,286 --> 00:48:10,523
EVERYBODY HAS TO GO TO JAIL AT

984
00:48:06,286 --> 00:48:10,523
SOME POINT, RIGHT?

985
00:48:06,286 --> 00:48:10,523

986
00:48:10,523 --> 00:48:16,696
BUT I'VE HAD A LOT OF FUN HERE,

987
00:48:10,523 --> 00:48:16,696
AND I FEEL REALLY LUCKY THAT I

1281

ON BREAK FOR CHRISTMAS.

1282
01:01:36,505 --> 01:01:41,165
AS SOME OF YOU KNOW, THIS IS
CECILY'S LAST DAY WORKING AT RADIO SHACK,

1283
01:01:41,165 --> 01:01:43,963
AFTER EIGHT
INCREDIBLE YEARS.

1284
01:01:43,963 --> 01:01:45,349
WELL, I'VE BEEN HERE 11.

1285
01:01:45,349 --> 01:01:48,674
I KNOW, AND EIGHT OF THEM
WERE INCREDIBLE.

1286
01:01:49,383 --> 01:01:52,784
HONESTLY, I DON'T THINK RADIO SHACK

1287
01:01:52,784 --> 01:01:55,631
COULD HAVE SURVIVED THIS
LONG WITHOUT CECILY.

1288
01:01:55,631 --> 01:01:59,093
EVERY TIME SHE CAME TO WORK, SHE
HAD A NEW CHARACTER

1289
01:01:59,093 --> 01:02:02,861
OR NEW
ACCENT OR NEW IMPRESSION THAT
WOULD BLOW YOU AWAY.

1290
01:02:02,861 --> 01:02:06,484
SHE'D HAVE A POWER AND JOY TO
HER PERFORMANCE

1291
01:02:06,484 --> 01:02:11,975
THAT MADE YOU
REMEMBER WHY YOU LOVED WORKING
AT RADIO SHACK

1292
01:02:12,190 --> 01:02:14,416
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

1293
01:02:14,416 --> 01:02:17,090
I KNOW I'M NOT SUPPOSED TO SAY
THIS AS YOUR BOSS,

1294
01:02:17,090 --> 01:02:19,206
BUT I LOVE
YOU, CECILY.

1295
01:02:19,206 --> 01:02:23,878
I LOVE YOU TOO, MR. FRANK
LASAGNA.

1296
01:02:23,878 --> 01:02:26,544
THAT'S RIGHT.
THAT IS MY NAME.

1297
01:02:26,544 --> 01:02:29,271
NOW WE ALL POOLED OUR MONEY TOGETHER,

1298
01:02:29,271 --> 01:02:31,397
MONEY THAT WAS
SUPPOSED TO GO TO CHILDREN IN NEED,

1299
01:02:31,397 --> 01:02:36,754
AND WE DECIDED TO HIRE A
SPECIAL GUEST FOR OUR CHRISTMAS
PARTY INSTEAD.

1300
01:02:36,754 --> 01:02:39,495
UNFORTUNATELY, THE COSTUME WAS EXTRA,

1301
01:02:39,495 --> 01:02:42,071
AND WE CHOSE TO NOT
SPRING FOR THAT.

1302
01:02:42,071 --> 01:02:46,102
SO PLEASE WELCOME, CASUAL ELVIS.

1303
01:02:52,417 --> 01:02:55,046
THANK YOU, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

1304
01:02:55,046 --> 01:02:57,551
YEAH, WE DIDN'T PAY FOR
THE VOICE EITHER.
