1
00:00:09,623 --> 00:00:12,448
GOOD EVENING.
IT'S GOOD TO BE WITH YOU.

2
00:00:12,448 --> 00:00:16,583
I'M KATY TUR, AND TONIGHT, OUR
LONG NATIONAL NIGHTMARE IS OVER.

3
00:00:16,583 --> 00:00:19,007
WE GOT THE BALLOON.

4
00:00:19,477 --> 00:00:23,527
THE DISCOVERY OF THE MASSIVE
SURVEILLANCE BALLOON EARLIER THIS WEEK

5
00:00:23,527 --> 00:00:26,948
INFLAMED ALREADY
VOLATILE U.S./CHINESE RELATIONS

6
00:00:26,948 --> 00:00:31,511
AND HAD MANY ON THE RIGHT
CALLING THE BIDEN
ADMINISTRATION'S RESPONSE SOFT,

7
00:00:31,511 --> 00:00:34,729
INCLUDING THIS TWEET FROM DONALD
TRUMP JR. SAYING,

8
00:00:34,729 --> 00:00:39,169
IF MY DAD WAS
PRESIDENT, THERE WOULD BE NO
BALLOON.

9
00:00:39,169 --> 00:00:41,986
AND THIS ONE FROM MARJORIE
TAYLOR GREEN SAYING,

10
00:00:41,986 --> 00:00:44,833
LOOK, IT'S
THE REAL MOON.

11
00:00:44,833 --> 00:00:48,854
FOR MORE DETAILS, I'M HONORED TO
BE JOINED TONIGHT BY PENTAGON OFFICIAL

12
00:00:48,854 --> 00:00:51,900
AND AVIATION EXPERT
GENERAL WILLIAM HAMILTON.

13
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:54,215
>> THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME.

14
00:00:55,838 --> 00:00:59,155
>> CON KBRACH LAGSS ON YOUR
SUCCESSFUL MISSION.

15
00:00:59,155 --> 00:01:02,795
>> THANK YOU.
WE POPPED THE BALLOON.

16
00:01:02,795 --> 00:01:08,196
>> GENERAL, WE'VE NEVER SEEN AN
OBJECT LIKE THIS GAIN ENTRY INTO
OUR AIR SPACE BEFORE.

17
00:01:08,196 --> 00:01:09,770
HOW DID THAT HAPPEN?

18
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:11,866
>> THAT'S AN EXCELLENT QUESTION, KATY

19
00:01:11,866 --> 00:01:17,735
IF BALLOON WAS SOMEHOW ABLE
TO GET PAST OUR WEST COAST
ANTIBALLOON DEFENSE SYSTEM,

20
00:01:17,735 --> 00:01:20,442
THE
SEATTLE SPACE NEEDLE.

21
00:01:20,951 --> 00:01:25,361
BUT ONCE IT WAS HERE, WE WERE
ABLE TO KEEP AN EYE ON IT

22
00:01:25,361 --> 00:01:27,541
WITH
OUR SOPHISTICATED TRACKING
TECHNOLOGY

23
00:01:27,541 --> 00:01:29,652
OF GOING LIKE THIS.

24
00:01:30,863 --> 00:01:32,738
>> UNDERSTOOD.

25
00:01:32,738 --> 00:01:36,814
>> I KNOW THERE ARE QUESTIONS
ABOUT WHY WE DIDN'T SHOOT IT
DOWN IMMEDIATELY,

26
00:01:36,814 --> 00:01:39,743
BUT WE WANTED
TO WAIT UNTIL IT WAS OVER THE COAST

27
00:01:39,743 --> 00:01:41,537
SO THAT IT WOULDN'T FALL ON PEOPLE

28
00:01:41,537 --> 00:01:47,809
OR GO -- SHSHSH AND
LAND ON MY CAR.

29
00:01:47,809 --> 00:01:51,112
>> IT LOOKED LIKE IT WAS A VERY
EXCITING OPERATION.

30
00:01:51,112 --> 00:01:52,372
CAN YOU TAKE US THROUGH IT?

31
00:01:52,372 --> 00:01:57,096
>> WELL, I DID BRING A 3D
RENTERING OF THE ENEMY TARGET.

32
00:02:00,407 --> 00:02:04,443
NOW, IMAGINE THIS IS A LOT BIGGER,

33
00:02:04,443 --> 00:02:08,963
BUT THEN, PRETTY FAR
AWAY, IT LOOKS A LOT SMALLER
TOO.

34
00:02:08,963 --> 00:02:13,478
>> NOW, THAT WAS GATHERING
INTEL?
WAS IT TAKING PICTURES?

35
00:02:13,478 --> 00:02:14,496
>> WE DON'T KNOW.

36
00:02:14,496 --> 00:02:18,579
BUT I DO KNOW IF YOU TAP IT, IT
PLAYS MUSIC.

37
00:02:23,925 --> 00:02:25,366
OKAY.

38
00:02:25,366 --> 00:02:28,578
>> WELL, GENERAL, THANK YOU SO
MUCH FOR YOUR HEROISM

39
00:02:28,578 --> 00:02:30,652
AND FOR
PROTECTING OUR NATION.

40
00:02:30,652 --> 00:02:32,055
>> THANK YOU, MRS. TUR,

41
00:02:32,055 --> 00:02:33,635
AND I WANT EVERYONE TO KNOW

42
00:02:33,635 --> 00:02:37,552
WE WILL NOT TOLERATE ANY FORM OF CHINESE
SPY.

43
00:02:37,552 --> 00:02:41,084
TO BE HONEST, THEY ALREADY HAVE
EVERYTHING THEY NEED FROM TIKTOK,

44
00:02:41,084 --> 00:02:43,621
SO SCROLL AWAY, KIDS.

45
00:02:43,621 --> 00:02:45,137
>> THANK YOU, GENERAL.

46
00:02:45,137 --> 00:02:49,854
THIS IS EXCITING.
I'M GETTING WORDS WE HAVE
LOCATED THE REMAINS OF THE BALLOON, 

47
00:02:49,854 --> 00:02:54,719
AND I'M TOLD WE HAVE A
LIVE FEED.
LET'S SEE HOW IT LOOKS.

48
00:02:54,719 --> 00:03:00,366
>> WELL, YOU GOT ME.

49
00:03:00,366 --> 00:03:04,755
CONGRATS, YOU SHOT A BALLOON.

50
00:03:04,755 --> 00:03:08,550
>> WOW.
BALLOON, WELL, I'M SORRY YOU'RE
IN THE WATER.

51
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:10,127
BUT THANK YOU FOR SPEAKING TO
US.

52
00:03:10,127 --> 00:03:14,111
>> I ENTERTAIN YOU PEOPLE FOR FOUR DAYS,

53
00:03:14,111 --> 00:03:16,994
 AND THEN GET SHOT BY
BIDEN?

54
00:03:16,994 --> 00:03:19,663
I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M JOE'S OSAMA.

55
00:03:19,745 --> 00:03:24,520
>> NOW, I HAVE TO ASK, WHAT WERE
YOU DOING FLYING OVER MONTANA?

56
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:29,571
>> I LOVE THE SHOW
YELLOWSTONE, SO I WAS JUST
THERE.

57
00:03:29,571 --> 00:03:32,282
IT'S LIKE "SUCCESSION" BUT
OUTSIDE.

58
00:03:32,282 --> 00:03:34,948
NOW I'M ALL WET, SO WHAT A DAY.

59
00:03:34,948 --> 00:03:37,490
>> WELL, I'M ACTUALLY SURPRISED
YOU'RE STILL FLOATING.

60
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:41,263
EXPERTS WERE SAYING YOU'RE THE
SIZE OF THREE BUSES.

61
00:03:41,263 --> 00:03:43,601
>> OKAY.
OUCH.

62
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:47,945
I'M A BALLOON, SO THAT'S MY
BODY.

63
00:03:47,945 --> 00:03:51,289
HOW WOULD YOU LIKE IT IF SOMEONE
MEASURED YOUR WIDTH IN BUSES?

64
00:03:51,289 --> 00:03:54,011
SORRY I'M NOT CAMERA READY.

65
00:03:54,011 --> 00:03:55,172
WHO IS THIS?

66
00:03:55,172 --> 00:03:58,366
GET AWAY.

67
00:03:58,366 --> 00:04:02,334
I HATE THE OCEAN.
I'M MORE OF AN AIR GUY.

68
00:04:02,334 --> 00:04:06,065
>> LOOK, I'M SORRY, BUT PEOPLE
WERE WORRIED THEY WERE BEING
SPIED ON.

69
00:04:06,065 --> 00:04:08,319
>> BY ME?
A BALLOON?

70
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:10,733
EVERYONE IS BEING SURVEILLED
CONSTANTLY,

71
00:04:10,733 --> 00:04:16,389
 BUT IT'S ALWAYS
SHOOT THE BALLOON AND NEVER,
UNPLUG ALEXA.

72
00:04:16,917 --> 00:04:22,416
IF YOU CARE SO MUCH ABOUT YOUR
DATA, WHY DO YOU ALL KEEP YOUR
BANK PASS WORDS IN THE NOTES
APP?

73
00:04:22,416 --> 00:04:26,201
YOU MAIL YOUR LITERAL DNA 

74
00:04:26,201 --> 00:04:30,670
TO A COMPANY TO FIND OUT IF YOU'RE LIKE 10% FRENCH,

75
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:33,825
 BUT JUST A
BALLOON.

76
00:04:33,825 --> 00:04:39,530
>> NOW, THE CONCERN WAS THAT YOU
WERE TAKING SENT TIF IMAGES OF
THE U.S.

77
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:41,553
>> I WAS SO FAR AWAY.

78
00:04:41,553 --> 00:04:45,595
IT'S LIKE WHEN YOUR AUNT TAKES A
CONCERT VIDEO ON HER iPAD,  

79
00:04:45,595 --> 00:04:49,555
AND
THEY'RE LIKE, I GUESS THAT'S
MICHAEL BUBLE.

80
00:04:49,555 --> 00:04:52,596
I COULDN'T EVEN TELL WHEN I WAS
LOOKING AT FROM UP THERE.

81
00:04:52,596 --> 00:04:57,142
FRANKLY, I THOUGHT THE STATE
LINES WOULD BE LIKE DRAWN OUT.

82
00:04:57,142 --> 00:05:00,347
I THOUGHT I WOULD SEE WORDS OVER
THE PLACES.

83
00:05:00,347 --> 00:05:04,877
>> WELL, WE JUST DID WHAT WE HAD
TO DO TO PROTECT THE SECURITY OF
OUR COUNTRY.

84
00:05:04,877 --> 00:05:09,844
>> WHY?
IS EVERYONE FREAKING OUT BECAUSE
I'M A CHINESE BALLOON.

85
00:05:09,844 --> 00:05:13,153
BECAUSE WHERE I COME FROM, I'M
JUST A BALLOON.

86
00:05:13,153 --> 00:05:15,868
>> THANKS FOR SPEAKING WITH US TODAY, 

87
00:05:15,868 --> 00:05:18,400
AND WE'RE SORRY FOR HOW
EVERYTHING HAD TO GO DOWN.

88
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,075
>> OH, KATY, DON'T DO THAT.

89
00:05:21,075 --> 00:05:26,248
YOU'VE MADE IT VERY CLEAR THAT
I'M NOT WELCOME HERE, SO GOOD
JOB.

90
00:05:26,248 --> 00:05:27,940
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING.

91
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:30,546
YOU'RE GOING TO MISS THIS
CHINESE SPY BALLOON --

92
00:05:30,546 --> 00:05:32,520
 I MEAN,
NORMAL BALLOON.

93
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:35,059
WELL, WHATEVER.
YOU ALREADY HAVE YOUR DATA.

94
00:05:35,059 --> 00:05:38,190
AND LIVE FROM NEW YORK, IT'S
SATURDAY NIGHT!

95
00:07:41,075 --> 00:07:46,066
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, PEDRO
PASCAL!

96
00:08:01,977 --> 00:08:05,801
>> THANK YOU, THANK YOU.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

97
00:08:05,801 --> 00:08:09,081
I'M SO EXCITED TO BE HERE.

98
00:08:09,952 --> 00:08:11,546
THANK YOU.

99
00:08:12,938 --> 00:08:19,028
I SPENT THE LAST YEAR SHOOTING A
SHOW CALLED "THE LAST OF US" ON
HBO.

100
00:08:19,885 --> 00:08:22,661
FOR SOME HBO SHOES, YOU GET TO
SHOOT 

101
00:08:22,661 --> 00:08:25,766
IN A FIVE STAR ITALIAN RESORT 
SURROUNDED BY BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE,

102
00:08:25,766 --> 00:08:28,431
 BUT I SAID, NO, THAT'S
TOO EASY.

103
00:08:28,431 --> 00:08:32,180
I WANT TO SHOOT IN A FREEZING
CANADIAN FOREST

104
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:36,917
 WHILE BEING
CHASED AROUND BY A GUY WHOSE
HEAD LOOKS LIKE A GENITAL WART.

105
00:08:36,917 --> 00:08:41,258
IT IS AN HONOR BEING A PART OF
THESE HUGE FRANCHISEs 

106
00:08:41,258 --> 00:08:43,771
LIKE "GAME
OF THRONES" AND "STAR WARS," BUT

107
00:08:43,771 --> 00:08:49,070
I'M STILL GETTING USED TO PEOPLE
RECOGNIZING ME.

108
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:54,314
THE OTHER DAY, A GUY STOPPED ME
ON THE STREET AND SAYS, MY SON
LOVES "THE MANDALORIAN" 

109
00:08:54,314 --> 00:08:57,330
AND THE
NEXT THING I KNOW, I'M FACE
TIMING WITH A 6-YEAR-OLD

110
00:08:57,330 --> 00:09:02,378
 WHO HAS
NO IDEA WHO I AM BECAUSE MY
CHARACTER WEARS A MASK THE
ENTIRE SHOW.

111
00:09:02,378 --> 00:09:05,203
THE GUY IS LIKE, DO THE MANDO VOICE, 

112
00:09:05,203 --> 00:09:09,512
BUT IT'S LIKE A BEDROOM
VOICE.

113
00:09:10,015 --> 00:09:13,705
WITHOUT THE MASK, IT JUST SOUNDS
PORNY.

114
00:09:13,705 --> 00:09:19,536
PEOPLE WALKING BY ON THE STREET
SEE ME WHISPERING TO A
6-YEAR-OLD KID.

115
00:09:19,536 --> 00:09:21,705
I CAN BRING YOU IN WARM, 

116
00:09:21,705 --> 00:09:24,818
OR I CAN BRING YOU IN COLD.

117
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:34,169
EVEN THOUGH I CAME TO THE U.S.
WHEN I WAS LITTLE, I WAS BORN IN CHILE,

118
00:09:34,651 --> 00:09:38,506
 AND I HAVE 34 FIRST
COUSINS WHO ARE STILL THERE.

119
00:09:38,506 --> 00:09:40,983
THEY'RE VERY PROUD OF ME.
I KNOW THEY'RE PROUD

120
00:09:40,983 --> 00:09:44,485
 BECAUSE
THEY GIVE MY PHONE NUMBER TO
EVERY PERSON THEY MEET,

121
00:09:44,485 --> 00:09:48,172
 WHICH
MEANS EVERY DAY, SOMEONE IN
SANTIAGO WILL TEXT ME STUFF LIKE, 

122
00:09:48,172 --> 00:09:52,664
CAN YOU COME TO MY
WEDDING, OR CAN YOU SING MY
PRIEST HAPPY BIRTHDAY, 

123
00:09:52,664 --> 00:09:55,952
OR IS
BABY YODA MEAN IN REAL LIFE.

124
00:09:55,952 --> 00:09:58,510
SO I HAVE TO BE LIKE NO, NO,

125
00:09:58,510 --> 00:10:02,027
 AND HIS NAME IS GROGU.

126
00:10:02,709 --> 00:10:06,132
BUT MY COUSINS WEREN'T ALWAYS SO
PROUD.

127
00:10:06,132 --> 00:10:10,012
EARLY IN MY CAREER, I PLAYED
SMALL PARTS IN EVERY CRIME SHOW.

128
00:10:10,012 --> 00:10:13,280
I EVEN PLAYED TWO DIFFERENT
CHARACTERS ON "LAW AND ORDER."

129
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:16,474
TITO CABASSA WHO LOOKED LIKE
THIS.

130
00:10:17,633 --> 00:10:22,291
AND ONE YEAR LATER, I PLAYED
REGGIE LUCKMAN WHO LOOKS LIKE
THIS.

131
00:10:23,084 --> 00:10:27,356
AND THAT, MY FRIENDS, IS CALLED
RANGE.

132
00:10:29,521 --> 00:10:32,179
BUT IT IS AMAZING TO BE HERE,

133
00:10:32,179 --> 00:10:34,146
LIKE I SAID,
I WAS BORN IN CHILE,

134
00:10:34,146 --> 00:10:39,435
 AND NINE
MONTHS LATER, MY PARENTS FLED
AND BROUGHT ME AND MY SISTER TO
THE U.S.

135
00:10:39,435 --> 00:10:44,499
THEY WERE SO BRAVE, AND WITHOUT
THEM, I WOULDN'T BE HERE IN THIS
WONDERFUL COUNTRY, 

136
00:10:44,499 --> 00:10:48,516
AND I
CERTAINLY WOULDN'T BE STANDING
HERE WITH YOU ALL TONIGHT.

137
00:10:48,516 --> 00:10:52,424
SO TO ALL MY FAMILY WATCHING IN
CHILE, I WANT TO SAY

138
00:10:56,964 --> 00:11:00,123
WHICH MEANS, I LOVE YOU, I MISS
YOU, 

139
00:11:00,123 --> 00:11:02,165
AND STOP GIVING OUT MY
PHONE NUMBER.

140
00:11:02,165 --> 00:11:07,515

01:05:23,620 --> 01:05:25,820
GIRL, DON'T START WITH THAT.

1503
01:05:25,822 --> 01:05:26,154
>> YOU KNOW WHAT, I'M GOING TO

1504
01:05:26,156 --> 01:05:28,289
SIT HERE AND EAT MY STEAK IN

1505
01:05:28,291 --> 01:05:30,759
PEACE.

1506
01:05:30,761 --> 01:05:36,331
>> WELL, ANYWAY.

1507
01:05:36,333 --> 01:05:36,831
I -- I DIDN'T TELL YOU GUYS, BUT

1508
01:05:36,833 --> 01:05:40,502
A FEW NIGHTS BACK, THIS DOG

1509
01:05:40,504 --> 01:05:40,769
FOLLOWED ME HOME.

1510
01:05:40,771 --> 01:05:47,609
>> I'M ABOUT TO TEAR THIS THING

1511
01:05:47,611 --> 01:05:49,978
UP.

1512
01:05:49,980 --> 01:05:53,314
>> WHEN I OPENED THE DOOR, HE --

1513
01:05:53,316 --> 01:05:53,682
HE JUST SPRINTED INSIDE.

1514
01:05:53,684 --> 01:05:54,983
>> THAT MAN DIDN'T GIVE ME NO

1515
01:05:54,985 --> 01:05:55,817
KETCHUP.

1516
01:05:55,819 --> 01:05:57,919
>> I'M RUNNING AROUND MY HOUSE

1517
01:05:57,921 --> 01:05:59,788
TRYING TO CATCH HIM.

1518
01:05:59,790 --> 01:06:01,956
>> YOU GOT KETCHUP OVER THERE?

1519
01:06:01,958 --> 01:06:03,491
>> GIRL, CAN YOU JUST EAT?

1520
01:06:03,493 --> 01:06:11,900
>> YOU THINK IT'S GOING TO BE

1521
01:06:11,902 --> 01:06:13,668
NASTY WITHOUT KETCHUP?

1522
01:06:13,670 --> 01:06:22,510
>> SO ANYWAY, I -- I GUESS I HAD

1523
01:06:22,512 --> 01:06:24,446
TWO BONES IN MY BASEMENT.

1524
01:06:24,448 --> 01:06:25,647
>> THAT'S SO CRAZY.

1525
01:06:25,649 --> 01:06:28,950

1526
01:06:28,952 --> 01:06:30,118
THIS STEAK.

1527
01:06:30,120 --> 01:06:31,619
THIS STEAK IS BUSSIN.

1528
01:06:31,621 --> 01:06:33,421
OH, MY GOD.

1529
01:06:33,423 --> 01:06:34,689
CAN YOU JUST CHILL?

1530
01:06:34,691 --> 01:06:35,724
HE'S TRYING TO TELL A STORY.

1531
01:06:35,726 --> 01:06:39,260
>> YOU HEARD THE MAN.

1532
01:06:39,262 --> 01:06:41,730
I HEARD HIM.

1533
01:06:41,732 --> 01:06:42,030
HE SAID HE GOT CHASED BY A DOG.

1534
01:06:42,032 --> 01:06:42,330
>> OKAY.

1535
01:06:42,332 --> 01:06:42,630
OKAY.

1536
01:06:42,632 --> 01:06:43,164
LISA.

TODD --

1542
01:06:53,910 --> 01:06:55,944
>> THE MAN.

1543
01:06:55,946 --> 01:06:58,913
>> ANTONIO BANDERES OVER HERE

1544
01:06:58,915 --> 01:07:01,549
TRYING TO GET SOME BUTT WHILE HE

1545
01:07:01,551 --> 01:07:01,883

EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT?

1549
01:07:09,726 --> 01:07:10,358
WE HAVE BEEN GETTING COMPLAINTS.

1550
01:07:10,360 --> 01:07:13,361

>> I'M JUST MAKING SURE

1554
01:07:20,804 --> 01:07:21,102
EVERYTHING'S OKAY.

1555
01:07:21,104 --> 01:07:22,670
>> ACTUALLY, EVERYTHING IS NOT

01:07:22,672 --> 01:07:25,840
OKAY.

1557

THERE IS WINE ALL IN THEIR FOOD.

IT'S ALL OVER THE FLOOR NOW.

1559
01:07:30,180 --> 01:07:31,679
Y'ALL NEED TO DO BETTER.

1560
