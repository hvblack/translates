1
00:00:02,516 --> 00:00:04,227
>>> CRIMINALS BEWARE.

2
00:00:04,227 --> 00:00:08,306
THERE'S A NEW SHERIFF IN TOWN,
AND HE MEANS BUSINESS.

3
00:00:08,306 --> 00:00:12,517
FIRST, HE THE HUNTED DOWN THE
JANUARY 6th INSURRECTIONISTS

4
00:00:12,517 --> 00:00:15,731
AND
MADE THEM PAY.

5
00:00:15,731 --> 00:00:18,652
NOW HE'S SEARCHING FOR
CLASSIFIED DOCUMENTS,

6
00:00:18,652 --> 00:00:21,151
AND HE'S
COMING FOR WHOEVER HAS THEM,

7
00:00:21,151 --> 00:00:23,195
DEMOCRATS, REPUBLICANS,

8
00:00:23,195 --> 00:00:25,184
OR WHATEVER TRUMP IS NOW.

9
00:00:25,184 --> 00:00:28,234
AND YOU DON'T WANT TO BE IN HIS
CROSS HAIRS.

10
00:00:28,234 --> 00:00:32,834
HE'S ATTORNEY GENERAL MERRICK GARLAND. 

11
00:00:33,108 --> 00:00:35,464
HELLO.

12
00:00:40,041 --> 00:00:42,742
I'M MERRICK GARLAND.

13
00:00:42,742 --> 00:00:46,572
I MAY LOOK LIKE I WAS BORN IN A LIBRARY, 

14
00:00:46,572 --> 00:00:50,168
BUT THERE'S SOMETHING
YOU SHOULD KNOW.

15
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:56,010
MERRICK GARLAND DON'T PLAY.

16
00:00:56,690 --> 00:01:01,236
AS YOU MAY HAVE HEARD,
CLASSIFIED DOCUMENTS HAVE BEEN FOUND

17
00:01:01,236 --> 00:01:06,508
 IN THE HOMES OF PRESIDENT
BIDEN AND FORMER VICE-PRESIDENT PENCE

18
00:01:06,508 --> 00:01:09,358
 WHOSE LAWYERS ARE COOPERATING.

19
00:01:09,358 --> 00:01:13,689
AND ALSO, AT THE HOME OF FORMER
PRESIDENT TRUMP,  

20
00:01:13,689 --> 00:01:17,784
WHOSE LAWYER
PUT A HORSE HEAD IN MY BED.

21
00:01:18,392 --> 00:01:24,371
SOME HAVE SAID THE FEDERAL
GOVERNMENT CLASSIFIES TOO MANY DOCUMENTS.

22
00:01:24,371 --> 00:01:26,665
ABOUT 50 MILLION A YEAR.

23
00:01:26,665 --> 00:01:31,853
THIS HAS LED PEOPLE TO ASK, DOES
RECOVERING THESE DOCUMENTS EVEN
MATTER?

24
00:01:31,853 --> 00:01:36,620
TO WHICH I SAY, I DON'T KNOW.

25
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:39,362
BUT IT'S THE LAW.

26
00:01:39,563 --> 00:01:44,906
AND I AM THE LAW.

27
00:01:49,529 --> 00:01:54,922
TO ENFORCE THE LAW, I SENT TEAMS
TO SEARCH THE HOMES

28
00:01:54,922 --> 00:01:58,756
 OF SEVERAL
RECENT PRESIDENTS AND
VICE-PRESIDENTS.

29
00:01:58,756 --> 00:02:01,225
STARTING WITH MIKE PENCE.

30
00:02:01,225 --> 00:02:07,418
SPECIAL AGENT CONRAD NANCE WILL
BRIEF YOU ON WHAT WE DISCOVERED.

31
00:02:10,073 --> 00:02:12,891
ALL RIGHT.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

32
00:02:12,977 --> 00:02:16,270
UPON ARRIVING AT MR. PENCE'S INDIANA HOME, 

33
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:19,749
I KNEW RIGHT AWAY
THIS MAN NEEDED A FRIEND.

34
00:02:20,839 --> 00:02:24,452
WHEN HE OPENED THE DOOR, HE
SAID, YOU CAME!

35
00:02:24,452 --> 00:02:28,876
WITH A BIG SMILE, AND HE OFFERED
TO MAKE US PANCAKES.

36
00:02:28,876 --> 00:02:32,424
OUR SEARCH TURNED UP NO
ADDITIONAL CLASSIFIED DOCUMENTS.

37
00:02:32,424 --> 00:02:36,273
HOWEVER, IN AN ENVELOPE MARKED "TAX STUFF" 

38
00:02:36,273 --> 00:02:40,297
WE DISCOVERED
PHOTOGRAPHS OF THE COUNTRY POP
STAR SINGER SHANIA TWAIN 

39
00:02:40,297 --> 00:02:42,983
CUT OUT
FROM SEVERAL MAGAZINES.

40
00:02:42,983 --> 00:02:47,471
WHEN CONFRONTED, MR. PENCE SAID,
I'M SORRY.
I'M DISGUSTING.

41
00:02:47,471 --> 00:02:52,849
THEN WE INFORMED MR. PENCE THAT
WE WERE DONE AND HAD TO LEAVE.

42
00:02:52,849 --> 00:02:56,037
HE SAID, HOW CAN YOU LEAVE WHEN
YOU'RE IT?

43
00:02:56,037 --> 00:03:01,532
AND THEN TAGGED ME ON THE
SHOULDER AND RAN AWAY.

44
00:03:01,532 --> 00:03:05,457
HOPING THAT I WOULD CHASE AFTER
HIM AND PLAY TAG,

45
00:03:05,457 --> 00:03:07,982
 WHICH I DID NOT.

46
00:03:07,982 --> 00:03:10,700
I WILL SAY, THOUGH, THAT IF YOU
KNOW MR. PENCE,

47
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:15,258
 IF YOU'RE
FRIENDS WITH HIM, CHECK ON YOUR
PEOPLE.
THAT'S ALL.

48
00:03:15,258 --> 00:03:19,815
ALL RIGHT.
THANK YOU, AGENT NANCE.

49
00:03:19,815 --> 00:03:24,017
NEXT, SPECIAL AGENT CASEY COMBS WILL DISCUSS

50
00:03:24,017 --> 00:03:30,664
 IF THERE WERE ANY
CLASSIFIED DOCUMENTS AT
VICE-PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS'
HOME.

51
00:03:31,789 --> 00:03:33,552
COME ON NOW.

52
00:03:33,552 --> 00:03:37,660
JOE BIDEN WON'T EVEN GIVE THIS
WOMAN A PEN.

53
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:41,688
YOU THINK SHE HAS CLASSIFIED

54
00:03:37,317 --> 00:03:41,688
DOCUMENTS?

55
00:03:37,317 --> 00:03:41,688
PLEASE.

56
00:03:41,688 --> 00:03:45,892
KAMALA HARRIS WITH CLASSIFIED DOCUMENTS.

57
00:03:41,688 --> 00:03:45,892
WELL, WE HAD TO AT LEAST

58
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:50,864
CHECK.

59
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:50,864
THANK YOU, AGENT COMBS.

60
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:50,864
FINALLY, WE SEARCHED FORMER

61
00:03:50,864 --> 00:03:58,705
PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA'S HOME.

62
00:03:50,864 --> 00:03:58,705
SPECIAL AGENT DERECK KAY WILL

63
00:03:50,864 --> 00:03:58,705
DISCUSS WHAT WE FOUND.

64
00:03:58,705 --> 00:04:03,243
THANK YOU. YEAH.

65
00:03:58,705 --> 00:04:03,243
DON'T MEAN TO BRAG, BUT I WAS IN

66
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:09,149
BARACK OBAMA'S HOUSE. YEAH.

67
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:09,149
NO BIG DEAL.

68
00:04:09,149 --> 00:04:16,856
BUT IT WAS REALLY FUN.

69
00:04:09,149 --> 00:04:16,856
MR. OBAMA OPENED THE DOOR AND

70
00:04:09,149 --> 00:04:16,856
SAID, ARE YOU SELLING GIRL SCOUT

71
00:04:16,856 --> 00:04:21,695
COOKIES, WHICH HAD US ALL

72
00:04:16,856 --> 00:04:21,695
TOTALLY CRACKING UP, LIKE

73
00:04:16,856 --> 00:04:21,695
COMPLETELY DEAD.

74
00:04:21,695 --> 00:04:30,303
WE THEN ENTERED THE HOME AND

75
00:04:21,695 --> 00:04:30,303
WERE SHOWN A NUMBER OF THINGS,

76
00:04:21,695 --> 00:04:30,303
INCLUDING 175 LETTERS FROM LIN

77
00:04:30,303 --> 00:04:40,380
MANUEL BEGGING THE PRESIDENT TO

78
00:04:30,303 --> 00:04:40,380
PERFORM HAMILTON.

79
00:04:30,303 --> 00:04:40,380
OBAMA LIKE READ ONE AS LIN

80
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:44,250
MANUEL.

81
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:44,250
I'M NOT JOKING.

82
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:44,250
IT WAS SO FUNNY.

83
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:52,726
ANYWAY, WE ASKED HIM ABOUT

84
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:52,726
CLASSIFIED DOCUMENTS, AND HE

85
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:52,726
SAID HE WAS, QUOTE, OUT OF THE

86
00:04:52,726 --> 00:04:57,664
GOVERNMENT GAME AND DOING THE

87
00:04:52,726 --> 00:04:57,664
HOLLYWOOD THING NOW.

88
00:04:52,726 --> 00:04:57,664
BUT THEN, BEYONCE CALLED HIM ON

89
00:04:57,664 --> 00:05:03,036
HIS CELL PHONE, AND HE IGNORED IT.

90
00:04:57,664 --> 00:05:03,036
SO, YEAH, JUST LIKE A REALLY

00:05:03,036 --> 00:05:06,106

94
00:05:06,106 --> 00:05:12,479

95
00:05:06,106 --> 00:05:12,479
IN YOUR HOME, I HAVE ONE

96
00:05:06,106 --> 00:05:12,479
QUESTION FOR YOU.

97
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:20,887
YOU THINK THIS IS A GAME?

98
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:20,887

99
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:20,887

IT'S BEEN A GREAT WEEK HERE AT SNL.

129
00:08:29,642 --> 00:08:34,681
YESTERDAY, I HAD A CRAZY FULL

130
00:08:34,681 --> 00:08:38,284
CIRCLE MOMENT.

131
00:08:34,681 --> 00:08:38,284
WE PRESHOT SOME VIDEOS FOR THE SHOW.

132
00:08:38,284 --> 00:08:44,457
WHEN I GOT TO THE STUDIO, I

133
00:08:38,284 --> 00:08:44,457
REALIZED IT WAS THE EXACT SAME

134
00:08:38,284 --> 00:08:44,457
PLACE I SHOT ONE OF MY FIRST

135
00:08:44,457 --> 00:08:52,665
ACTING ROLES ON THE SOAP OPERA,

136
00:08:44,457 --> 00:08:52,665
"ALL MY CHILDREN" I WAS 16 YEARS OLD.

137
00:08:52,665 --> 00:08:55,135
HERE'S A CLIP.

138
00:08:52,665 --> 00:08:55,135
I TOLD YOU IN THE BEGINNING

139
00:08:52,665 --> 00:08:55,135
YOU SET THE PACE.

140
00:08:55,135 --> 00:08:59,639
SO YOU'RE NOT MAD?

141
00:08:55,135 --> 00:08:59,639
NO.

142
00:08:55,135 --> 00:08:59,639
SOMETIMES THE ANIMAL IN ME JUST

143
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:07,080
GETS KIND OF CRAZY.

144
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:07,080
PRETTY SURE I HIT PUBERTY

145
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:11,818
MID-HOWL.

146
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:11,818
THAT WAS 2003.

147
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:11,818
AND NOW 20 YEARS LATER, I JUST

148
00:09:11,818 --> 00:09:20,326
DIRECTED MY VERY FIRST MOVIE,

149
00:09:11,818 --> 00:09:20,326
"CREED III" BUT RIGHT AFTER

150
00:09:11,818 --> 00:09:20,326
THAT, I WENT THROUGH MY VERY

151
00:09:20,326 --> 00:09:25,198
FIRST PUBLIC BREAKUP.

152
00:09:20,326 --> 00:09:25,198
MOST PEOPLE AFTER A BREAKUP ARE

153
00:09:20,326 --> 00:09:25,198
LIKE, I'M GOING TO GET IN BETTER

154
00:09:25,198 --> 00:09:27,167
SHAPE.

155
00:09:25,198 --> 00:09:27,167
BUT I WAS ALREADY IN CREED SHAPE.

156
00:09:27,167 --> 00:09:32,672
SO I HAD TO BE LIKE, ALL RIGHT,

157
00:09:27,167 --> 00:09:32,672
I GUESS I'LL LEARN A NEW LANGUAGE.

158
00:09:32,672 --> 00:09:40,714
ANYWAY, ESTOY EN RAYA.

159
00:09:32,672 --> 00:09:40,714
AFTER THE BREAKUP, EVERYONE

160
00:09:32,672 --> 00:09:40,714
THOUGHT I WAS SO HEART BROKEN.

161
00:09:40,714 --> 00:09:46,453
I WAS AT A BASKETBALL GAME WHEN

162
00:09:40,714 --> 00:09:46,453
THE NEWS BROKE OUT, AND THEY

163
00:09:40,714 --> 00:09:46,453
CAUGHT ME LOOKING LIKE THIS.

164
00:09:46,453 --> 00:09:52,926

YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES I CAN TAKE

233
00:12:01,821 --> 00:12:06,326

289
00:14:28,468 --> 00:14:33,840
ROLLER COASTER RIDE FROM HELL.

290
00:14:28,468 --> 00:14:33,840

291
00:14:28,468 --> 00:14:33,840
I THINK SHE-- I THINK SHE

292
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:38,712
COMPARED THE WINE TO ALL THOSE

293
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:38,712
LOOP-DE-LOOPS.

294
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:38,712
WE ACTUALLY HAVE SOME VIDEO OF

295
00:14:38,712 --> 00:14:45,685
THAT.

296
00:14:38,712 --> 00:14:45,685
YEAH.

297
00:14:38,712 --> 00:14:45,685
MUST BE HARD TO WATCH, HUH,

298
00:14:45,685 --> 00:14:51,958
FRANCINE?

299
00:14:45,685 --> 00:14:51,958
WHAT WAS THAT?

300
00:14:45,685 --> 00:14:51,958

301
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:59,466
CRISPY CRUNCH OF MY CRISPY,

00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:59,466

00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:59,466
WELL, THANKS, FRANCINE.

304
00:14:59,466 --> 00:15:05,739
NOW IT'S TIME FOR THE WEATHER

305
00:14:59,466 --> 00:15:05,739
WITH OUR VERY OWN JASON BURRESS.

306
00:14:59,466 --> 00:15:05,739
HI, GUYS.

307
00:15:05,739 --> 00:15:13,813
IT LOOKS LIKE A DOOZY.

308
00:15:05,739 --> 00:15:13,813
OBVIOUSLY WE FORGOT TO

309
00:15:05,739 --> 00:15:13,813
MENTION THAT JASON WAS ALSO

310
00:15:13,813 --> 00:15:18,051
TRAPPED ON THE ROLLER COASTER.

311
00:15:13,813 --> 00:15:18,051
I ACTUALLY THINK WE HAVE A

312
00:15:13,813 --> 00:15:18,051
PICTURE OF THAT.

313
00:15:18,051 --> 00:15:23,456
OH.

00:15:18,051 --> 00:15:23,456
SO HOW'S THE WEATHER LOOKING,

315
00:15:18,051 --> 00:15:23,456
JASON?

316
00:15:23,456 --> 00:15:28,528
IT'S NOT GOOD AT ALL.

317
00:15:23,456 --> 00:15:28,528
WE HAVE SNOW COMING IN FROM THE EAST.

318
00:15:28,528 --> 00:15:31,531
UH-HUH.

319
00:15:28,528 --> 00:15:31,531
WE HAVE SNOW COMING IN FROM THE

320
00:15:28,528 --> 00:15:31,531
WEST, UH-HUH.

321
00:15:31,531 --> 00:15:37,671
SNOW FROM THE TOP, YEAH, AND

322
00:15:31,531 --> 00:15:37,671
SNOW FROM THE BOTTOM.

323
00:15:31,531 --> 00:15:37,671
LOOK, I'M DIZZY AS HELL FROM

324
00:15:37,671 --> 00:15:42,709
THAT ROLLER COASTER RIDE.

325
00:15:37,671 --> 00:15:42,709
WAIT A MINUTE.

326
00:15:37,671 --> 00:15:42,709
SOMETHING SURE SMELLS GOOD.

327
00:15:42,709 --> 00:15:48,648
OH, WHAT YOU COOKING OVER

328
00:15:42,709 --> 00:15:48,648

00:15:48,648 --> 00:15:55,555
BUT CAREFUL, IT'S HOT.

331
00:15:48,648 --> 00:15:55,555
YOU GOT TO BLOW ON IT. MM.

332
00:15:55,555 --> 00:16:08,702
THAT LOOKS DELICIOSO. MM.

333
00:15:55,555 --> 00:16:08,702
OH, MM, MM, MM.

334
00:16:08,702 --> 00:16:16,509
YES.

335
00:16:08,702 --> 00:16:16,509
GREAT.

336
00:16:08,702 --> 00:16:16,509
WELL, I GUESS YOU GUYS MUST

337
00:16:16,509 --> 00:16:20,647
BE PRETTY HUNGRY AFTER THAT

338
00:16:16,509 --> 00:16:20,647
CRAZY RIDE. YEAH.

339
00:16:20,647 --> 00:16:25,819
THE ONLY THING WE HAD TO EAT

340
00:16:20,647 --> 00:16:25,819
WERE THE BUGS THAT FLEW INTO OUR

341
00:16:20,647 --> 00:16:25,819
OPEN MOUTHS.

342
00:16:25,819 --> 00:16:35,395
YEAH.

343
00:16:25,819 --> 00:16:35,395
BUGS LIKE BUMBLEBEES, CICADAS,

344
00:16:25,819 --> 00:16:35,395
AND ONE DOG-SIZED BAT.

345
00:16:35,395 --> 00:16:44,104
NOW, THAT'S A SPICY MEATBALL.

346
00:16:35,395 --> 00:16:44,104
WOULD YOU CARE FOR SOME

347
00:16:35,395 --> 00:16:44,104
SPAGHETTI, JASON?

348
00:16:44,104 --> 00:16:48,575
OH, OKAY.

349
00:16:44,104 --> 00:16:48,575
OH, MY GOSH.

350
00:16:44,104 --> 00:16:48,575
YOU GUYS ARE SO CUTE TOGETHER.

351
00:16:48,575 --> 00:16:53,179
OF COURSE YOU PROBABLY GOT

352
00:16:48,575 --> 00:16:53,179
REAL CLOSE DURING YOUR TIME

353
00:16:48,575 --> 00:16:53,179
TOGETHER ON THE ROLLER COASTER.

354
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:57,550
WAIT.

355
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:57,550
WHAT ARE THEY DOING NOW?

356
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:57,550
I THINK THEY'RE DOING A

357
00:16:57,550 --> 00:17:08,161
LITTLE LADY AND THE TRAMP THING.

358
00:16:57,550 --> 00:17:08,161
AWW, SO ROMANTIC.

359
00:16:57,550 --> 00:17:08,161
I'M SORRY.

360
00:17:08,161 --> 00:17:11,931
FRANCINE, IS THERE SOMETHING

361
00:17:08,161 --> 00:17:11,931
UNDER YOUR SHIRT?

362
00:17:08,161 --> 00:17:11,931
OH, I ALMOST FORGOT.

363
00:17:11,931 --> 00:17:20,640
SAY HELLO TO MY LITTLE FRIEND.

364
00:17:11,931 --> 00:17:20,640
IS THAT A BIRD KICKING ITS

365
00:17:11,931 --> 00:17:20,640
LITTLE LEGS?

366
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:25,345
YEP.

367
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:25,345
HE FLEW STRAIGHT INTO HER

368
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:25,345
STOMACH AT 200 MILES AN HOUR.

369
00:17:25,345 --> 00:17:30,884
THE DOCTORS SAY IF I PULL IT

370
00:17:25,345 --> 00:17:30,884
OUT, BOTH OF US WILL DIE.

371
00:17:25,345 --> 00:17:30,884
NOW BACK TO YOU GUYS.

372
00:17:30,884 --> 00:17:35,689
ALL RIGHT.

373
00:17:30,884 --> 00:17:35,689
COMING UP NEXT, OUR EXCLUSIVE

374
00:17:30,884 --> 00:17:35,689
INTERVIEW WITH THE TEENAGE BOY

375
00:17:35,689 --> 00:17:42,062
WHO OPERATED THE ROLLER COASTER

376
00:17:35,689 --> 00:17:42,062
AND WHY HE DID NOTHING TO STOP IT.

377
00:17:42,062 --> 00:17:49,903
IT.

378
00:17:42,062 --> 00:17:49,903
TWO REASONS:TOO DUMB AND TOO HIGH.

379
00:17:57,210 --> 00:18:04,317
PRIDE OURSELVES ON A SMOOTH

380
00:17:57,210 --> 00:18:04,317
FLYING EXPERIENCE.

381
00:17:57,210 --> 00:18:04,317
OVER THE HOLIDAY SEASON, WE

382
00:18:04,317 --> 00:18:06,019
MESSED UP.

383
00:18:04,317 --> 00:18:06,019
OUR SYSTEM COLLAPSED, AND

384
00:18:04,317 --> 00:18:06,019
THOUSANDS OF FLYERS WERE LEFT

385
00:18:06,019 --> 00:18:10,790
STRANDED, AND YOU UNDERSTANDABLY

386
00:18:06,019 --> 00:18:10,790
SCREAMED AT US FOR DAYS ON END,

387
00:18:06,019 --> 00:18:10,790
EVEN MORE THAN YOU USUALLY DO.

388
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:21,034
AND SURE, WE LOST

389
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:21,034
$800 MILLION IN REV KNEW AND ARE

390
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:21,034
BEING INVESTIGATED BY THE FAA.

391
00:18:21,034 --> 00:18:28,475
FOR STARTERS, WE ARE FINALLY

392
00:18:21,034 --> 00:18:28,475
UPGRADING OUR ENTIRE COMPUTER

393
00:18:21,034 --> 00:18:28,475
SYSTEM TO 2008 DELL COMPUTERS.

394
00:18:28,475 --> 00:18:33,279
THAT'S RIGHT.

395
00:18:28,475 --> 00:18:33,279
WE ARE SAYING GOOD-BYE TO THOSE

396
00:18:28,475 --> 00:18:33,279
IBM THINKPAD LAPTOPS WITH THE

397
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:37,117
LITTLE RED NIPPLE IN THE MIDDLE.

398
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:37,117
NO MORE MISSING BAGGAGE AT

399
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:37,117
BAGGAGE CLAIM, GUARANTEED.

400
00:18:37,117 --> 00:18:42,589
FROM HERE ON OUT, ALL LUGGAGE

401
00:18:37,117 --> 00:18:42,589
WILL BE SORTED BY COLOR.

402
00:18:37,117 --> 00:18:42,589
THAT MAKES IT YOUR

403
00:18:42,589 --> 00:18:47,527
RESPONSIBILITY, NOT OURS.

404
00:18:42,589 --> 00:18:47,527
SO IF YOU'RE GOING TO DALLAS,

405
00:18:42,589 --> 00:18:47,527
BRING A RED SUITCASE.

406
00:18:47,527 --> 00:18:55,068
BLUE BAGS GO TO CHARLOTTE.

407
00:18:47,527 --> 00:18:55,068
AND GET TO THE AIRPORT EARLY

408
00:18:47,527 --> 00:18:55,068
TO ENJOY OUR NEW PREMIER LOUNGE

409
00:18:55,068 --> 00:19:00,040
LOCATED INSIDE STARBUCKS.

410
00:18:55,068 --> 00:19:00,040
WE HOLD DOWN TWO OR THREE TABLES

411
00:18:55,068 --> 00:19:00,040
FOR Y'ALL.

412
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:07,280
WE'RE MODERNIZING OUR AIR

413
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:07,280
TRAFFIC CONTROL NETWORK.

414
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:07,280
WE WILL BE USING OUR OLD IBM

415
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:10,016
THINKPAD LAPTOPS WITH THE LITTLE

416
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:10,016
RED NIPPLE IN THE MIDDLE.

417
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:10,016
NOW I GET A PROPER FLIGHT

418
00:19:10,016 --> 00:19:14,721
SCHEDULE INSTEAD OF FINDING OUT

419
00:19:10,016 --> 00:19:14,721
WHERE I'M GOING 15 MINUTES

420
00:19:10,016 --> 00:19:14,721
BEFORE TAKEOFF.

421
00:19:14,721 --> 00:19:18,258
AND NOW WE'RE STREAMLINING

422
00:19:14,721 --> 00:19:18,258
CHECK IN BY NOT HAVING ONE AT ALL.

423
00:19:18,258 --> 00:19:22,028
TRYING TO FILL UP THE PLANE

424
00:19:18,258 --> 00:19:22,028
AND GO.

425
00:19:18,258 --> 00:19:22,028
YOU GOOD.

426
00:19:22,028 --> 00:19:29,736
WE'RE ALSO UPGRADING OUR

427
00:19:22,028 --> 00:19:29,736
INFLIGHT STAFF STRICTLY WITH

428
00:19:22,028 --> 00:19:29,736
PEOPLE WHO USED TO WORK AT

429
00:19:29,736 --> 00:19:34,841
WAFFLE HOUSE.

430
00:19:29,736 --> 00:19:34,841
COME AT THEM IF YOU WANT, BUT

431
00:19:29,736 --> 00:19:34,841
THESE BIG PITCHES DON'T PLAY.

432
00:19:34,841 --> 00:19:38,645
THAT'S ON US. MOSTLY.

433
00:19:34,841 --> 00:19:38,645
SOME OF IT'S ON YOU.

434
00:19:38,645 --> 00:19:41,247
YOU BOUGHT THE TICKET.

435
00:19:38,645 --> 00:19:41,247
AGAIN, YOU BOUGHT A SOUTHWEST TICKET.

436
00:19:41,247 --> 00:19:45,051
YOU OBVIOUSLY DON'T RESPECT

437
00:19:41,247 --> 00:19:45,051
YOURSELF, SO WHY SHOULD WE?

438
00:19:45,051 --> 00:19:48,655
THANK YOU.

439
00:19:45,051 --> 00:19:48,655
THANK YOU.

440
00:19:45,051 --> 00:19:48,655

00:19:48,655 --> 00:19:54,260
WELCOME ABOARD.

442
00:19:48,655 --> 00:19:54,260
SOUTHWEST AIRLINES.

443
00:19:48,655 --> 00:19:54,260
IF IT'S THAT IMPORTANT TO YOU,

444
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:56,229
SOUTHWEST AIRLINES.

445
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:56,229
IF IT'S THAT IMPORTANT TO YOU,

446
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:56,229
JUST WALK.

447
00:20:03,937 --> 00:20:09,442
THEN, SOMEHOW, THEY FIND NEMO.

448
00:20:03,937 --> 00:20:09,442
NO, MAN.

449
00:20:03,937 --> 00:20:09,442
THAT'S CRAZY, MAN.

450

00:20:17,183 --> 00:20:21,287
CAN I GET A TOWEL?

456
00:20:17,183 --> 00:20:21,287
YES, OF COURSE.

457
00:20:17,183 --> 00:20:21,287
HEY, YOU AMERICAN?

677
00:28:42,589 --> 00:28:46,526

678
00:28:46,526 --> 00:28:52,065

00:28:56,569 --> 00:29:02,008

THANKS FOR LETTING ME PLAY. YEAH.

690
00:29:04,210 --> 00:29:07,847

691
00:29:07,847 --> 00:29:11,484
MORE GRUNTS, YOU KNOW?

692
00:29:07,847 --> 00:29:11,484
YOU'RE FIGHTING.

693
00:29:07,847 --> 00:29:11,484

GOT IT.

698
00:29:15,488 --> 00:29:18,558
TRACE, YOU DON'T NEED TO

699
00:29:15,488 --> 00:29:18,558
CHANGE WHAT YOU WERE DOING.

700
00:29:18,558 --> 00:29:23,830
BUT DANNY, MAYBE IT'S MORE

701
00:29:18,558 --> 00:29:23,830
AGGRESSIVE, ANIMALISTIC, THAT

702
00:29:18,558 --> 00:29:23,830
KIND OF THING.

703
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:27,300

714
00:29:38,645 --> 00:29:41,114

00:29:41,114 --> 00:29:44,317

00:29:41,114 --> 00:29:44,317
THANK YOU.

718
00:29:44,317 --> 00:29:47,787
I WAS JUST TAKING YOUR NOTE.

719
00:29:44,317 --> 00:29:47,787
YOU SAID TO DO ANIMALS. YEAH.

720
00:29:47,787 --> 00:30:01,368
BUT I SAID A BUNCH OCH STUFF

721
00:29:47,787 --> 00:30:01,368
BEFORE THAT.

722
00:29:47,787 --> 00:30:01,368
WELL, I HAVE AUDITORY BIASED,

723
00:30:01,368 --> 00:30:04,571
SO YOU CAN CAN'T SAY THAT TO ME,

724
00:30:01,368 --> 00:30:04,571
I CAN SUE YOU.

725
00:30:01,368 --> 00:30:04,571
DON'T FIGHT.

726
00:30:04,571 --> 00:30:10,877
IT REMINDS ME OF THE WAR.

727
00:30:04,571 --> 00:30:10,877
LET'S MOVE ON.

728
00:30:04,571 --> 00:30:10,877
WE NEED TO GET VERBAL PHRASES TO

729
00:30:10,877 --> 00:30:15,782
SAY DURING THE FIGHT.

730
00:30:10,877 --> 00:30:15,782
HEY, I LIKE YOUR NECKLACE.

731
00:30:10,877 --> 00:30:15,782
OH, THIS OLD THING?

732
00:30:15,782 --> 00:30:18,084
THANKS.

733
00:30:15,782 --> 00:30:18,084
YEA!

734
00:30:15,782 --> 00:30:18,084

735
00:30:18,084 --> 00:30:25,125
WHAT ARE YOUR PRONOUNS?

736
00:30:18,084 --> 00:30:25,125
HE/HIM.

737
00:30:18,084 --> 00:30:25,125
I'LL TELL HIM.

738
00:30:25,125 --> 00:30:30,830
KENNETH, HE/THEY.

739
00:30:25,125 --> 00:30:30,830
WE CAN'T USE ANY OF THAT.

740
00:30:25,125 --> 00:30:30,830
OH, THAT MAKES ME SAD.

741
00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:35,035
IS THERE A REASON?

742
00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:35,035
YES.

743
00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:35,035
BECAUSE NO ONE SOUNDS LIKE THAT

744
00:30:35,035 --> 00:30:38,338
WHEN THEY FIGHT.

745
00:30:35,035 --> 00:30:38,338
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

746
00:30:35,035 --> 00:30:38,338
YOU REMIND ME EXACTLY OF SOMEONE

747
00:30:38,338 --> 00:30:42,942
I SERVED WITH IN IRAQ.

748
00:30:38,338 --> 00:30:42,942
OH, YOU WENT TO IRAQ.

749
00:30:38,338 --> 00:30:42,942
WHERE DID YOU STAY?

750
00:30:42,942 --> 00:30:48,248
DIDN'T WANT TO SAY THIS.

751
00:30:42,942 --> 00:30:48,248
BUT YOU NEED TO PLAY MORE HETERO.

752
00:30:48,248 --> 00:30:50,950
YOU SHOULD HAVE JUST SAID

753
00:30:48,248 --> 00:30:50,950
THAT FROM THE BEGINNING.

754
00:30:48,248 --> 00:30:50,950

755
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:55,188

1236
00:45:36,703 --> 00:45:40,073

1238
00:45:40,073 --> 00:45:47,180

1243
00:45:53,086 --> 00:45:57,090
YOU EVER THINK ABOUT US, ANGEL.

1244
00:45:53,086 --> 00:45:57,090
DON'T.

1245
00:45:57,090 --> 00:46:07,567

1246
00:45:57,090 --> 00:46:07,567
BEFORE TOMMY, THERE WAS CREEDY.

WHAT?

1250
00:46:07,567 --> 00:46:13,373
TOMMY NEVER ASKED WHY ONE OF HIS

1251
00:46:13,373 --> 00:46:17,243
KIDS WAS BLACK?

1252
00:46:13,373 --> 00:46:17,243
TOMMY DON'T SEE COLOR.

1253
00:46:13,373 --> 00:46:17,243
THAT'S NICE.

1254
00:46:17,243 --> 00:46:25,952

1255
00:46:17,243 --> 00:46:25,952

00:46:17,243 --> 00:46:25,952
NUMBERS, OR SHAPES.

1257
00:46:25,952 --> 00:46:33,259

BUT THEN, I DEVELOPED MY SOCIAL

1283
00:47:24,944 --> 00:47:30,216
MASTERY PROGRAM.

1284
00:47:30,216 --> 00:47:38,925
NOW I STAND LIKE AN ALPHA.

1285
00:47:30,216 --> 00:47:38,925
I'VE GOT THE SCARF.

1286

00:47:42,862 --> 00:47:46,232
HELL YES.

1292

WHAT WAS YOUR APPROACH?

1293
00:47:46,232 --> 00:47:54,774
WELL, SHE'S NOT A GIRLFRIEND.

1294
00:47:46,232 --> 00:47:54,774
SHE'S ACTUALLY LIKE A BARISTA.

1295
00:47:46,232 --> 00:47:54,774
BUT, HEY, YOU INTRODUCED

1296

ROUND OF APPLAUSE FOR HIM.

1301
00:47:57,844 --> 00:48:01,548
THAT'S NOT NOTHING, FOLKS.

1302
00:48:01,548 --> 00:48:07,053
THAT'S NOT NOTHING.

1303
00:48:01,548 --> 00:48:07,053
YES, A QUESTION IN THE BACK.

1304
00:48:01,548 --> 00:48:07,053
WHERE DO YOU WANT THIS WATER

00:49:22,562 --> 00:49:25,031
OH, OKAY.

1348
00:49:25,031 --> 00:49:30,470
LOOK.

1349
00:49:25,031 --> 00:49:30,470
NO MATTER WHAT A LADY THROWS AT

1350
00:49:25,031 --> 00:49:30,470
YOU, AND THEY CAN SAY SOME

1351
00:49:30,470 --> 00:49:34,507
PRETTY RANDOM STUFF, JUST ROLL

1352
00:49:30,470 --> 00:49:34,507
WITH IT.

1353
00:49:30,470 --> 00:49:34,507
I NEED A VOLUNTEER.

1354
00:49:34,507 --> 00:49:40,046
I THINK YOU STOOD UP FIRST, SIR.

1355
00:49:34,507 --> 00:49:40,046
IF YOU'RE COOL WITH IT.

1356
00:49:34,507 --> 00:49:40,046
YOU DON'T MIND IF I DO THIS,

1357
00:49:40,046 --> 00:49:43,416
RIGHT?

1358
00:49:40,046 --> 00:49:43,416
YEAH.

1359
00:49:40,046 --> 00:49:43,416

1360
00:49:43,416 --> 00:49:48,088
SEE, DEXTER'S LAB IS COOL WITH YOU.

1361
00:49:43,416 --> 00:49:48,088
GO AHEAD, GOOFY.

1362
00:49:48,088 --> 00:49:52,225
NOT GOOFY.

1363
00:49:48,088 --> 00:49:52,225
I'M GOING TO DO WHAT I CALL A

1364
00:49:48,088 --> 00:49:52,225
BASIC OPENING.

1365
00:49:52,225 --> 00:49:55,695
HEY, GODDESS.

1366
00:49:52,225 --> 00:49:55,695
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

1367
00:49:52,225 --> 00:49:55,695
YOU A BITCH.

1368
00:49:55,695 --> 00:49:59,799
HEY.

1369
00:49:55,695 --> 00:49:59,799
HEY.

1370
00:49:55,695 --> 00:49:59,799
JUST DO THE EXERCISE.

1371
00:49:59,799 --> 00:50:03,970
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

1372
00:49:59,799 --> 00:50:03,970
FOREHEAD JACKSON.

1373
00:49:59,799 --> 00:50:03,970
IT'S NOT.

1374
00:50:03,970 --> 00:50:06,439
PLEASE SIT DOWN.

1375
00:50:03,970 --> 00:50:06,439
I'M GOOD HERE.

1376
00:50:03,970 --> 00:50:06,439
THAT'S FINE.

1377
00:50:06,439 --> 00:50:10,944
ANY FINAL QUESTIONS?

1378
00:50:06,439 --> 00:50:10,944
YEAH.

1379
00:50:06,439 --> 00:50:10,944
I WAS WONDERING IF YOU HAVE ANY

1380
00:50:10,944 --> 00:50:15,882
TIPS ON COPING WITH HAVING A BIG

1381
00:50:10,944 --> 00:50:15,882
OLD FOREHEAD.

1382
00:50:10,944 --> 00:50:15,882
I DON'T HAVE A BIG OLD

1383
00:50:15,882 --> 00:50:19,052
FOREHEAD, OKAY?

1384
00:50:15,882 --> 00:50:19,052
I'M NOT LIKE YOU, DUDE.

1385
00:50:15,882 --> 00:50:19,052
I'M COOL.

1386
00:50:19,052 --> 00:50:23,990

1388
00:50:23,990 --> 00:50:27,761
YOU GOT A JIMMY NEUTRON HEAD, BRO.

1389
00:50:23,990 --> 00:50:27,761
HE KIND OF DOES.

1390
00:50:27,761 --> 00:50:32,332
NO.

1391
00:50:27,761 --> 00:50:32,332
NO, MY HEAD IS REGULAR.

1392
00:50:27,761 --> 00:50:32,332
NOT JIMMY NEUTRON.

1393
00:50:32,332 --> 00:50:38,905
IT'S LIKE IF JIMMY NEUTRON

1394
00:50:32,332 --> 00:50:38,905
DID STREET MAGIC, THAT'S YOU.

1395
00:50:32,332 --> 00:50:38,905
NO, IT'S NOT.

1396
00:50:38,905 --> 00:50:41,441

1399
00:50:41,441 --> 00:50:45,545
I FEEL LIKE I CAN TEACH YOU SOME THINGS.

1400
00:50:41,441 --> 00:50:45,545
WHERE ARE YOU GUYS GOING?

1401
00:50:45,545 --> 00:50:49,716

1402
00:50:45,545 --> 00:50:49,716

00:51:05,699 --> 00:51:12,238
OH, MY GOSH.

00:51:12,238 --> 00:51:15,442
DON'T TELL ME.

1411
00:51:12,238 --> 00:51:15,442
DON'T TELL ME.

1412
00:51:12,238 --> 00:51:15,442
IT'S ABOUT TO GET HOT IN

1413
00:51:15,442 --> 00:51:22,482
HERE.

1414
00:51:15,442 --> 00:51:22,482
AHH!

1415
00:51:15,442 --> 00:51:22,482
HELLO, LADIES.

1419
00:51:29,189 --> 00:51:36,896
HORNY.

1420
00:51:29,189 --> 00:51:36,896
YOU GUYS ARE SO BAD.

1421
00:51:29,189 --> 00:51:36,896
THIS IS WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.

1422
00:51:36,896 --> 00:51:45,705
I'M ABOUT TO INTRODUCE Y'ALL

1423
00:51:36,896 --> 00:51:45,705

00:51:52,512 --> 00:51:58,985

1429
00:51:52,512 --> 00:51:58,985
OKAY, MR. POP AND LOCK.

1440
00:52:15,969 --> 00:52:23,476
HEY.

1441
00:52:15,969 --> 00:52:23,476

I CAN'T, YOU GUYS.

1480
00:53:28,074 --> 00:53:31,277
I CAN'T.

1481
00:53:31,277 --> 00:53:35,949
YEAH.

1482
00:53:31,277 --> 00:53:35,949
YOU KNOW, I THINK I WAS

1483
00:53:31,277 --> 00:53:35,949
ENVISIONING JUST LIKE ONE DANCER

1484
00:53:35,949 --> 00:53:40,186
AND NOT LIKE A PREGNANT WOMAN

1485
00:53:35,949 --> 00:53:40,186
WITH A REALLY LONG PHONE CHARGER.

1486
00:53:40,186 --> 00:53:45,091
OH, GIRL, DON'T HOLD BACK

1487
00:53:40,186 --> 00:53:45,091
BECAUSE OF ME.

1488
00:53:40,186 --> 00:53:45,091
YOU CAN TOUCH HIM.

1489
00:53:45,091 --> 00:53:46,993
YOU CAN KISS HIM.

1490
00:53:45,091 --> 00:53:46,993
I PROMISE YOU.

1491
00:53:45,091 --> 00:53:46,993
I DON'T MIND, AND SHE DON'T

1492
00:53:46,993 --> 00:53:53,733
MIND.

1493
00:53:46,993 --> 00:53:53,733
SEE, SEE.

1494
00:53:46,993 --> 00:53:53,733

OH, I HOPE AND PRAY TO GOD YOU

1497
00:53:53,733 --> 00:53:57,937

BECAUSE THAT ONE, MY FRIENDS,

1502
00:54:03,710 --> 00:54:08,515
THAT KEEPS THE RELATIONSHIP ALIVE.

1503
00:54:03,710 --> 00:54:08,515
THAT KEEPS THE SEXUALITY ALIVE.

1504
00:54:08,515 --> 00:54:13,053
OKAY.

1505
00:54:08,515 --> 00:54:13,053
SO THIS IS GETTING JUST A LITTLE

1506
00:54:08,515 --> 00:54:13,053

1686
00:59:41,047 --> 00:59:48,121
GET YOUR BUTT DOWN HERE OFF

00:59:41,047 --> 00:59:48,121
TAKE THE LEFT LANE.

1689
00:59:48,121 --> 00:59:53,259
YOU GOT TO GET HARD IN THAT

1690
00:59:48,121 --> 00:59:53,259
LEFT LANE BECAUSE IF YOU STAY

1691
00:59:48,121 --> 00:59:53,259
EVEN ONE SECOND IN THE RIGHT

1692

THE LINE BACKS UP TO THE

1696
00:59:58,465 --> 01:00:03,136
LIGHT ON TO THE OFF-RAMP AND

1697
00:59:58,465 --> 01:00:03,136
INTO THE HIGHWAY.

1698
01:00:03,136 --> 01:00:10,076
DO NOT STAY IN THE RIGHT LANE.

1699
01:00:03,136 --> 01:00:10,076
HARD, HARD LEFT, Y'ALL.

1700

TOYOTA'S OVERSTOCK SALE-A-THON.

1703
01:00:10,076 --> 01:00:16,649
WHY ARE WE OVERSTOCKED?

1704
01:00:16,649 --> 01:00:23,790
I'LL TELL YOU WHY, BECAUSE

1705
01:00:16,649 --> 01:00:23,790
NOBODY CAN GET HERE DUE TO THE

1706
01:00:16,649 --> 01:00:23,790
STUPID LONG CANE'S LINE TAKING

HE HAS DEFILED 260.

1713
01:00:45,111 --> 01:00:52,185
THESE TRENDY CHAINS ALL COME

1714
01:00:45,111 --> 01:00:52,185
WITH THEIR OWN MASSIVE DRIVE

1715
01:00:45,111 --> 01:00:52,185
THROUGH LINES MANAGED ONLY BY A

1716
01:00:52,185 --> 01:00:58,858
HANDFUL OF iPADED TEENS.

1717
01:00:52,185 --> 01:00:58,858
WE ARE DEEP IN THE RED,

1718
01:00:52,185 --> 01:00:58,858

THEIR HANDS DIRTY.

1724
01:01:05,398 --> 01:01:16,743
CANES, YOU HAVE TWO HOURS TO GET

1725
01:01:16,743 --> 01:01:23,516

01:01:26,119 --> 01:01:34,394
AND WE ARE TRAPPED HERE.

1732
01:01:26,119 --> 01:01:34,394
WE LITERALLY CANNOT LEAVE DUE TO

1733
01:01:34,394 --> 01:01:41,101
THE LONG AS HELL CANES LINES.

1734
01:01:34,394 --> 01:01:41,101
I HAVE MISSED SO MANY FAMILY

STAND, KING BROTHERS TOYOTA WILL

1745
01:02:01,054 --> 01:02:05,492

1746
01:02:01,054 --> 01:02:05,492
MY DAUGHTER HAILEY IS A

1752
01:02:12,298 --> 01:02:15,168
I SAID, I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT,

1753
01:02:12,298 --> 01:02:15,168

THE A BY HUGO GALLEGOS.

1756
01:02:15,168 --> 01:02:23,943
ALL THAT IS LOST BECAUSE WE

1757
01:02:23,943 --> 01:02:31,551
HAVE BRIAN PATMORE.

1758
01:02:23,943 --> 01:02:31,551
WELL, BRIAN PATMORE DON'T

01:02:39,592 --> 01:02:44,931
TIKTOK, CANES, TIKTOK.

1765
01:02:39,592 --> 01:02:44,931
COME ON DOWN BECAUSE TIME IS

1766
01:03:03,750 --> 01:03:07,053

THERE'S NO REASON TO BE NERVOUS.

1773
01:03:11,591 --> 01:03:17,364
WHEW, NO ONE SAW ME.

1774
01:03:11,591 --> 01:03:17,364

01:03:26,339 --> 01:03:29,676
AT LEAST IT'S JUST ANDREW DISMUKES.

1781
01:03:26,339 --> 01:03:29,676
IT'S ALL GOOD.

1782
01:03:29,676 --> 01:03:33,546
I WILL NOT FALL AGAIN.

I DIDN'T SEE YOU THERE.

1786
01:03:33,546 --> 01:03:37,083
LOOKED LIKE IT HURT.

1787
01:03:33,546 --> 01:03:37,083
IT DIDN'T REALLY.

1788
01:03:37,083 --> 01:03:43,723
LOOKED LIKE IT DID, THOUGH.

1789

HEY, MAN, I'M AT WORK.

1806
01:04:10,884 --> 01:04:14,888
YOU DON'T WANT ME TO SEE YOU

1807
01:04:14,888 --> 01:04:18,458
FALL DOWN, QUIT FALLING DOWN

1808
01:04:14,888 --> 01:04:18,458

1809
01:04:18,458 --> 01:04:21,327
JUST LEAVE ME ALONE.

1810
01:04:18,458 --> 01:04:21,327
ALL RIGHT, BUD.

HEY, GUYS.

1814
01:04:21,327 --> 01:04:28,468
ANDREW, SIT DOWN.

1815
01:04:28,468 --> 01:04:34,074
YOU HAVE TO STOP SEEING

1816
01:04:28,468 --> 01:04:34,074
MICHAEL B. JORDAN FALL DOWN.

1817
01:04:28,468 --> 01:04:34,074
I CAN'T HELP IT.

1818
01:04:34,074 --> 01:04:39,512
SOMETIMES HE FALLS, AND I SEE.

1819
01:04:34,074 --> 01:04:39,512
ANDREW, WHEN SOMEBODY FALLS

1820
01:04:34,074 --> 01:04:39,512
DOWN, YOU HAVE TO PRETEND LIKE

1821
01:04:39,512 --> 01:04:45,285
YOU DIDN'T SEE IT.

1822
01:04:39,512 --> 01:04:45,285
WELL, I DIDN'T KNOW THAT.

1823
01:04:39,512 --> 01:04:45,285
NOBODY TOLD ME THAT.

1824
01:04:45,285 --> 01:04:50,090
YOU CAN'T GET MAD AT ME FOR

1825
01:04:45,285 --> 01:04:50,090
SOMETHING I DIDN'T KNOW.

1826
01:04:45,285 --> 01:04:50,090
GUYS?

1827
01:04:50,090 --> 01:04:54,227
WHAT'S GOING ON?

1828
01:04:50,090 --> 01:04:54,227
NOTHING.

1829
01:04:50,090 --> 01:04:54,227
AND HEY, NEXT TIME YOU HAVE A

1830
01:04:54,227 --> 01:05:01,534
PROBLEM WITH ME, AT LEAST HAVE

1831
01:04:54,227 --> 01:05:01,534
THE KAHONES TO SAY IT TO MY FACE

1832
01:04:54,227 --> 01:05:01,534
INSTEAD OF SENDING YOUR LACKIES

1833
01:05:01,534 --> 01:05:08,241
TO DO YOUR DIRTY WORK FOR YOU.

1834
01:05:01,534 --> 01:05:08,241
I DIDN'T TELL THEM ANYTHING

1835
01:05:01,534 --> 01:05:08,241
EXCEPT YOU KEEP SEEING ME FALL.

1836
01:05:08,241 --> 01:05:12,812
WELL GUESS WHAT, SOMETIMES

1837
01:05:08,241 --> 01:05:12,812
YOU FALL, AND SOMETIMES I THERE.

1838
01:05:08,241 --> 01:05:12,812
WELL, THEN MAYBE YOU

1839
01:05:12,812 --> 01:05:16,616
SHOULDN'T BE AROUND ME AT ALL THEN.

1840
01:05:12,812 --> 01:05:16,616
MAYBE YOU SHOULD LEAVE AND NEVER

1841
01:05:16,616 --> 01:05:18,051
COME BACK.

1842
01:05:16,616 --> 01:05:18,051
WHATEVER, MAN.

1843
01:05:16,616 --> 01:05:18,051
I'M DONE.

1844
01:05:18,051 --> 01:05:25,058
DONE!

1845
01:05:18,051 --> 01:05:25,058
I COULDN'T BELIEVE WHAT I HAD

1846
01:05:25,058 --> 01:05:29,629
DONE.

1847
01:05:25,058 --> 01:05:29,629
I PUSHED AWAY MY BEST FRIEND AT

1848
01:05:25,058 --> 01:05:29,629
THE SHOW.

1849
01:05:29,629 --> 01:05:33,333
ANDREW DIS-MOE.

1850
01:05:29,629 --> 01:05:33,333
AFTER EVERYTHING WE HAVE BEEN THROUGH.

1851
01:05:33,333 --> 01:05:38,738
MONDAY PITCH IN LAUREN'S OFFICE,

1852
01:05:33,333 --> 01:05:38,738
TUESDAY WRITING NIGHT.

1853
01:05:33,333 --> 01:05:38,738
WHEN ANDREW GOT CUT FROM A

1854
01:05:38,738 --> 01:05:45,812
SKETCH BECAUSE HE DID A BAD JOB.

1855
01:05:38,738 --> 01:05:45,812
JUST TO THROW IT ALL AWAY

1856
01:05:38,738 --> 01:05:45,812
BECAUSE HE SAW ME FALL DOWN A

1857
01:05:45,812 --> 01:05:49,783
LOT?

1858
01:05:45,812 --> 01:05:49,783
THE SHOW WAS ABOUT TO START, BUT

1859
01:05:45,812 --> 01:05:49,783
I COULDN'T DO IT WITHOUT HIM.

1860
01:05:49,783 --> 01:05:55,255
DOES ANYONE HAVE EYES ON

1861
01:05:49,783 --> 01:05:55,255
MICHAEL B. JORDAN?

1862
01:05:49,783 --> 01:05:55,255
I KNEW THERE WAS ONLY ONE WAY

1863
01:05:55,255 --> 01:05:59,392
TO BRING HIM BACK.

1864
01:05:55,255 --> 01:05:59,392
I'M FALLING.

1865
01:05:55,255 --> 01:05:59,392
WHERE ARE YOU, ANDREW?

1866
01:05:59,392 --> 01:06:08,268
I'M RIGHT HERE.

1867
01:05:59,392 --> 01:06:08,268
AND WE'RE NOT FALLING.

1868
01:05:59,392 --> 01:06:08,268
WE'RE FLYING.

1869
01:06:08,268 --> 01:06:11,237
AND WE'RE NOT FALLING.

1870
01:06:08,268 --> 01:06:11,237
WE'RE FLYING.

1871
01:06:08,268 --> 01:06:11,237
WHOO!

1872
01:06:22,148 --> 01:06:27,187
I ALSO WANT TO THANK EVERYBODY HERE.

1873

I WANT TO THANK THE TALENTED

1874
01:06:27,187 --> 01:06:31,458

THIS IS AN INCREDIBLE EXPERIENCE.

1881
01:06:37,430 --> 01:06:40,633
THERE'S NOTHING LIKE IT IN THE WORLD.

1882
01:06:37,430 --> 01:06:40,633
I CAN'T WAIT TO COME BACK.

1883

01:06:40,633 --> 01:06:45,939
YOU AIN'T GOT NOTHING?

1885

CAN'T WAIT TO DO IT AGAIN.

1886
01:06:45,939 --> 01:06:52,112
YOU AIN'T GOT NOTHING?

1887

CAN'T WAIT TO DO IT AGAIN.
