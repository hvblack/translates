1
00:00:02,516 --> 00:00:04,227
>>> CRIMINALS BEWARE.

2
00:00:04,227 --> 00:00:08,306
THERE'S A NEW SHERIFF IN TOWN,
AND HE MEANS BUSINESS.

3
00:00:08,306 --> 00:00:12,517
FIRST, HE THE HUNTED DOWN THE
JANUARY 6th INSURRECTIONISTS

4
00:00:12,517 --> 00:00:15,731
AND
MADE THEM PAY.

5
00:00:15,731 --> 00:00:18,652
NOW HE'S SEARCHING FOR
CLASSIFIED DOCUMENTS,

6
00:00:18,652 --> 00:00:21,151
AND HE'S
COMING FOR WHOEVER HAS THEM,

7
00:00:21,151 --> 00:00:23,195
DEMOCRATS, REPUBLICANS,

8
00:00:23,195 --> 00:00:25,184
OR WHATEVER TRUMP IS NOW.

9
00:00:25,184 --> 00:00:28,234
AND YOU DON'T WANT TO BE IN HIS
CROSS HAIRS.

10
00:00:28,234 --> 00:00:32,834
HE'S ATTORNEY GENERAL MERRICK GARLAND.

11
00:00:33,108 --> 00:00:35,464
HELLO.

12
00:00:40,041 --> 00:00:42,742
I'M MERRICK GARLAND.

13
00:00:42,742 --> 00:00:46,572
I MAY LOOK LIKE I WAS BORN IN A LIBRARY,

14
00:00:46,572 --> 00:00:50,168
BUT THERE'S SOMETHING
YOU SHOULD KNOW.

15
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:56,010
MERRICK GARLAND DON'T PLAY.

16
00:00:56,690 --> 00:01:01,236
AS YOU MAY HAVE HEARD,
CLASSIFIED DOCUMENTS HAVE BEEN FOUND

17
00:01:01,236 --> 00:01:06,508
IN THE HOMES OF PRESIDENT
BIDEN AND FORMER VICE-PRESIDENT PENCE

18
00:01:06,508 --> 00:01:09,358
WHOSE LAWYERS ARE COOPERATING.

19
00:01:09,358 --> 00:01:13,689
AND ALSO, AT THE HOME OF FORMER
PRESIDENT TRUMP,

20
00:01:13,689 --> 00:01:17,784
WHOSE LAWYER
PUT A HORSE HEAD IN MY BED.

21
00:01:18,392 --> 00:01:24,371
SOME HAVE SAID THE FEDERAL
GOVERNMENT CLASSIFIES TOO MANY DOCUMENTS.

22
00:01:24,371 --> 00:01:26,665
ABOUT 50 MILLION A YEAR.

23
00:01:26,665 --> 00:01:31,853
THIS HAS LED PEOPLE TO ASK, DOES
RECOVERING THESE DOCUMENTS EVEN
MATTER?

24
00:01:31,853 --> 00:01:36,620
TO WHICH I SAY, I DON'T KNOW.

25
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:39,362
BUT IT'S THE LAW.

26
00:01:39,563 --> 00:01:44,906
AND I AM THE LAW.

27
00:01:49,529 --> 00:01:54,922
TO ENFORCE THE LAW, I SENT TEAMS
TO SEARCH THE HOMES

28
00:01:54,922 --> 00:01:58,756
OF SEVERAL
RECENT PRESIDENTS AND
VICE-PRESIDENTS.

29
00:01:58,756 --> 00:02:01,225
STARTING WITH MIKE PENCE.

30
00:02:01,225 --> 00:02:07,418
SPECIAL AGENT CONRAD NANCE WILL
BRIEF YOU ON WHAT WE DISCOVERED.

31
00:02:10,073 --> 00:02:12,891
ALL RIGHT.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

32
00:02:12,977 --> 00:02:16,270
UPON ARRIVING AT MR. PENCE'S INDIANA HOME,

33
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:19,749
I KNEW RIGHT AWAY
THIS MAN NEEDED A FRIEND.

34
00:02:20,839 --> 00:02:24,452
WHEN HE OPENED THE DOOR, HE
SAID, YOU CAME!

35
00:02:24,452 --> 00:02:28,876
WITH A BIG SMILE, AND HE OFFERED
TO MAKE US PANCAKES.

36
00:02:28,876 --> 00:02:32,424
OUR SEARCH TURNED UP NO
ADDITIONAL CLASSIFIED DOCUMENTS.

37
00:02:32,424 --> 00:02:36,273
HOWEVER, IN AN ENVELOPE MARKED "TAX STUFF"

38
00:02:36,273 --> 00:02:40,297
WE DISCOVERED
PHOTOGRAPHS OF THE COUNTRY POP
STAR SINGER SHANIA TWAIN

39
00:02:40,297 --> 00:02:42,983
CUT OUT
FROM SEVERAL MAGAZINES.

40
00:02:42,983 --> 00:02:47,471
WHEN CONFRONTED, MR. PENCE SAID,
I'M SORRY.
I'M DISGUSTING.

41
00:02:47,471 --> 00:02:52,849
THEN WE INFORMED MR. PENCE THAT
WE WERE DONE AND HAD TO LEAVE.

42
00:02:52,849 --> 00:02:56,037
HE SAID, HOW CAN YOU LEAVE WHEN
YOU'RE IT?

43
00:02:56,037 --> 00:03:01,532
AND THEN TAGGED ME ON THE
SHOULDER AND RAN AWAY.

44
00:03:01,532 --> 00:03:05,457
HOPING THAT I WOULD CHASE AFTER
HIM AND PLAY TAG,

45
00:03:05,457 --> 00:03:07,982
WHICH I DID NOT.

46
00:03:07,982 --> 00:03:10,700
I WILL SAY, THOUGH, THAT IF YOU
KNOW MR. PENCE,

47
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:15,258
IF YOU'RE
FRIENDS WITH HIM, CHECK ON YOUR
PEOPLE.
THAT'S ALL.

48
00:03:15,258 --> 00:03:19,815
ALL RIGHT.
THANK YOU, AGENT NANCE.

49
00:03:19,815 --> 00:03:24,017
NEXT, SPECIAL AGENT CASEY COMBS WILL DISCUSS

50
00:03:24,017 --> 00:03:30,664
IF THERE WERE ANY
CLASSIFIED DOCUMENTS AT
VICE-PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS'
HOME.

51
00:03:31,789 --> 00:03:33,552
COME ON NOW.

52
00:03:33,552 --> 00:03:37,660
JOE BIDEN WON'T EVEN GIVE THIS
WOMAN A PEN.

53
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:40,348
YOU THINK SHE HAS CLASSIFIED
DOCUMENTS?

54
00:03:40,348 --> 00:03:44,112
PLEASE.
KAMALA HARRIS WITH CLASSIFIED DOCUMENTS.

55
00:03:44,705 --> 00:03:47,136
WELL, WE HAD TO AT LEAST
CHECK.

56
00:03:47,136 --> 00:03:49,058
THANK YOU, AGENT COMBS.

57
00:03:49,058 --> 00:03:53,411
FINALLY, WE SEARCHED FORMER
PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA'S HOME.

58
00:03:53,411 --> 00:03:58,104
SPECIAL AGENT DERECK KAY WILL
DISCUSS WHAT WE FOUND.

59
00:03:58,104 --> 00:03:59,928
THANK YOU.

60
00:03:59,928 --> 00:04:03,386
YEAH.
DON'T MEAN TO BRAG,

61
00:04:03,386 --> 00:04:07,329
BUT I WAS IN
BARACK OBAMA'S HOUSE.

62
00:04:09,434 --> 00:04:12,910
NO BIG DEAL.
BUT IT WAS REALLY FUN.

63
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:15,255
MR. OBAMA OPENED THE DOOR AND SAID,

64
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,598
ARE YOU SELLING GIRL SCOUT COOKIES,

65
00:04:16,598 --> 00:04:19,570
WHICH HAD US ALL
TOTALLY CRACKING UP,

66
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:21,843
LIKE
COMPLETELY DEAD.

67
00:04:21,843 --> 00:04:24,957
WE THEN ENTERED THE HOME AND
WERE SHOWN A NUMBER OF THINGS,

68
00:04:24,957 --> 00:04:29,921
INCLUDING 175 LETTERS FROM LIN MANUEL

69
00:04:29,921 --> 00:04:33,587
BEGGING THE PRESIDENT TO
PERFORM HAMILTON.

70
00:04:33,587 --> 00:04:36,919
OBAMA LIKE READ ONE AS LIN
MANUEL.

71
00:04:36,919 --> 00:04:41,011
LIKE
DEAR MISTER

72
00:04:41,011 --> 00:04:44,308
I'M NOT JOKING.
IT WAS SO FUNNY.

73
00:04:44,378 --> 00:04:47,068
ANYWAY, WE ASKED HIM ABOUT
CLASSIFIED DOCUMENTS,

74
00:04:47,068 --> 00:04:49,961
AND HE
SAID HE WAS, QUOTE, OUT OF THE
GOVERNMENT GAME

75
00:04:49,961 --> 00:04:52,469
AND DOING THE
HOLLYWOOD THING NOW.

76
00:04:52,469 --> 00:04:56,309
BUT THEN, BEYONCE CALLED HIM ON
HIS CELL PHONE,

77
00:04:56,309 --> 00:04:58,718
AND HE IGNORED IT.

78
00:04:58,718 --> 00:05:02,930
SO, YEAH, JUST LIKE A REALLY
COOL, FUN TIME.

79
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:06,339
ALL RIGHT.
THERE YOU HAVE IT, AMERICA.

80
00:05:06,339 --> 00:05:10,914
IF YOU HAVE CLASSIFIED DOCUMENTS
IN YOUR HOME,

81
00:05:10,914 --> 00:05:13,486
I HAVE ONE
QUESTION FOR YOU.

82
00:05:13,486 --> 00:05:16,118
YOU THINK THIS IS A GAME?

83
00:05:16,118 --> 00:05:20,255
WHO DO YOU THINK YOU'RE PLAYING
WITH?

84
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:24,992
F AROUND AND FIND OUT.

85
00:05:27,673 --> 00:05:30,791
HEY, BOSS.
WHEN WE DONE PLAYING WITH THESE
LITTLE PAPERS,

86
00:05:30,791 --> 00:05:34,015

DOWN TO MEMPHIS AND MAKE SURE
JUSTICE IS SERVED DOWN THERE
TOO, RIGHT?

87
00:05:34,015 --> 00:05:37,926
- I SINCERELY HOPE SO.
- YOU'RE DAMN RIGHT.

88
00:05:37,926 --> 00:05:41,785
AND LIVE FROM NEW YORK, IT'S
SATURDAY NIGHT!

89
00:07:45,198 --> 00:07:50,454
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, MICHAEL B. JORDAN.

90
00:08:06,301 --> 00:08:08,987
THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU
VERY MUCH.

91
00:08:08,987 --> 00:08:10,686
I AM SO HAPPY TO BE HERE.

92
00:08:10,686 --> 00:08:12,425
MY NAME IS MICHAEL B. JORDAN.

93
00:08:12,425 --> 00:08:15,745
BUT TONIGHT, MICHAEL B. HOSTING.

94
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:17,403
MICHAEL B. JOKING.

95
00:08:17,403 --> 00:08:20,285
AND HONESTLY, MICHAEL B. NERVOUS.

96
00:08:20,285 --> 00:08:22,566
MICHAEL B. VULNERABLE.

97
00:08:22,566 --> 00:08:25,080
BUT DON'T WORRY.
MICHAEL B. ALL RIGHT.

98
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:29,245
BECAUSE MICHAEL B. IN THERAPY.

99
00:08:29,768 --> 00:08:32,418
IT'S BEEN A GREAT WEEK HERE AT SNL.

100
00:08:32,418 --> 00:08:35,081
YESTERDAY, I HAD A CRAZY FULL
CIRCLE MOMENT.

101
00:08:35,081 --> 00:08:37,262
WE PRESHOT SOME VIDEOS FOR THE SHOW.

102
00:08:37,262 --> 00:08:41,161
WHEN I GOT TO THE STUDIO, I
REALIZED IT WAS THE EXACT SAME PLACE

103
00:08:41,161 --> 00:08:45,017
I SHOT ONE OF MY FIRST
ACTING ROLES ON THE SOAP OPERA,
"ALL MY CHILDREN"

104
00:08:45,017 --> 00:08:47,932
I WAS 16 YEARS OLD.
HERE'S A CLIP.

105
00:08:47,932 --> 00:08:50,906
I TOLD YOU IN THE BEGINNING
YOU SET THE PACE.

106
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:55,721
SO YOU'RE NOT MAD?
NO.

107
00:08:55,721 --> 00:08:59,793
SOMETIMES THE ANIMAL IN ME JUST
GETS KIND OF CRAZY.

108
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:05,339
PRETTY SURE I HIT PUBERTY
MID-HOWL.

109
00:09:05,339 --> 00:09:07,348
THAT WAS 2003.

110
00:09:07,348 --> 00:09:12,594
AND NOW 20 YEARS LATER, I JUST
DIRECTED MY VERY FIRST MOVIE, "CREED III"

111
00:09:13,102 --> 00:09:19,657
BUT RIGHT AFTER
THAT, I WENT THROUGH MY VERY
FIRST PUBLIC BREAKUP.

112
00:09:19,657 --> 00:09:24,006
MOST PEOPLE AFTER A BREAKUP ARE
LIKE, I'M GOING TO GET IN BETTER
SHAPE.

113
00:09:24,006 --> 00:09:26,750
BUT I WAS ALREADY IN CREED SHAPE.

114
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:30,102
SO I HAD TO BE LIKE, ALL RIGHT,
I GUESS I'LL LEARN A NEW LANGUAGE.

115
00:09:30,102 --> 00:09:33,843
ANYWAY, ESTOY EN RAYA.

116
00:09:33,843 --> 00:09:37,668
AFTER THE BREAKUP, EVERYONE
THOUGHT I WAS SO HEART BROKEN.

117
00:09:37,668 --> 00:09:40,098
I WAS AT A BASKETBALL GAME WHEN
THE NEWS BROKE OUT,

118
00:09:40,098 --> 00:09:42,461
AND THEY
CAUGHT ME LOOKING LIKE THIS.

119
00:09:44,056 --> 00:09:49,027
I WAS JUST CHILLING, BUT THE
INTERNET DECIDED THAT WAS ME
BEING SAD.

120
00:09:49,027 --> 00:09:51,896
LUCKY FOR ME, IF YOU GOOGLE
MICHAEL JORDAN,

121
00:09:51,896 --> 00:09:55,142
THE FIRST 8,000
RESULTS ARE THIS.

122
00:09:59,003 --> 00:10:00,432
HEY, MICHAEL.

123
00:10:00,432 --> 00:10:03,008
- WHAT'S UP, CHLOE?
- NOT MUCH.

124
00:10:03,008 --> 00:10:06,729
SO I KNOW YOU'RE SINGLE, BUT DID
YOU KNOW THAT I'M SINGLE?

125
00:10:06,729 --> 00:10:11,300
- DON'T YOU DATE THAT HOT
WRITER?
- NOT IF YOU'RE AVAILABLE.

126
00:10:13,376 --> 00:10:17,761
HEY.
COULD YOU REMIND ME HOW TO SPELL
YOUR NUMBER?

127
00:10:17,816 --> 00:10:20,447
HEY, CHLOE, DON'T YOU HAVE TO
GO AWAY?

128
00:10:20,447 --> 00:10:23,226
I'M SORRY, BITCH.

129
00:10:23,226 --> 00:10:25,704
HEY, MIKEY B.

130
00:10:25,704 --> 00:10:29,943
- MIND IF I CALL YOU MIKEY B.?
- I WOULD RATHER YOU NOT.

131
00:10:29,943 --> 00:10:33,347
OKAY.
A MAN WHAT KNOWS WHAT HE WANTS.
I LIKE THAT.

132
00:10:33,347 --> 00:10:37,215
YOU KNOW, I HAVE A CREED POSTER
IN MY BEDROOM.

133
00:10:37,215 --> 00:10:41,061
OH, NICE.
I ALWAYS DREAMED OF PEOPLE
HAVING MY POSTER UP ON THE WALL.

134
00:10:41,061 --> 00:10:44,382
YEAH, WALL, PRINTED ON TO A
BODY PILLOW.
WHATEVER.

135
00:10:44,382 --> 00:10:47,094
EXCUSE ME.

136
00:10:47,094 --> 00:10:49,150
GO ON, BITCH.

137
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:51,771
HEY, MICHAEL.

138
00:10:51,771 --> 00:10:54,962
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW YOU WERE OUT HERE.

139
00:10:54,962 --> 00:10:58,543
YOU DIDN'T KNOW I WOULD BE ON
STAGE DELIVERING MY MONOLOGUE?

140
00:10:58,543 --> 00:11:01,977
SORRY.
I WAS JUST TAKING A WALK AROUND
THE STUDIO, AND I JUST THREW
THIS ON.

141
00:11:01,977 --> 00:11:04,917
IS THIS A WEDDING DRESS?

142
00:11:04,917 --> 00:11:08,490
I GUESS WE COULD TECHNICALLY GET
MARRIED NOW THEN, HUH?

143
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:10,466
THAT'S NOT HOW THAT WORKS.

144
00:11:10,466 --> 00:11:11,953
OUR FIRST FIGHT.

145
00:11:11,953 --> 00:11:14,383
MAKEUP SEX?

146
00:11:14,383 --> 00:11:17,870
- EGO.
- FINE, MICHAEL.

147
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:22,294
MICHAEL, MICHAEL, MICHAEL.

148
00:11:24,199 --> 00:11:28,780
BOY, YOU LOOKING FINE AS EVER AS ALWAYS.

149
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:32,793
- PUNKIE.
- I GOT THE SAME SUIT LIKE YOU GOT.

150
00:11:32,793 --> 00:11:35,167
- AREN'T YOU GAY?
- I AM.

151
00:11:35,167 --> 00:11:38,509
BUT YOU MICHAEL B. JORDAN.

152
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:42,748
AND I'M PUNKIE B. CURIOUS.

153
00:11:42,748 --> 00:11:48,912
- I MEAN, EVEN VEGANS GOT CHEAT
DAYS, RIGHT?
- NO, THEY DON'T.

154
00:11:49,247 --> 00:11:51,700
BOY, YOU SO FUNNY.

155
00:11:54,612 --> 00:11:57,650
I SEE YOU AT THE AFTERPARTY,
BABE.

156
00:11:58,479 --> 00:12:02,248
LOOK, I JUST WANT TO SAY I'M
SO GRATEFUL TO BE STANDING ON
THIS STAGE.

157
00:12:02,248 --> 00:12:04,782
YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES I CAN TAKE
MYSELF A LITTLE TOO SERIOUSLY.

158
00:12:04,782 --> 00:12:08,207
BUT TONIGHT, I'M GOING TO HAVE FUN.
I'M GOING TO GO FOR IT

159
00:12:08,207 --> 00:12:12,764
AND
MAYBE, JUST MAYBE, LET THE INNER
ANIMAL GET A LITTLE CRAZY.

160
00:12:13,579 --> 00:12:16,576
WE GOT A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT.

161
00:12:16,576 --> 00:12:19,151
STICK

162
00:12:27,313 --> 00:12:32,318

163
00:12:27,313 --> 00:12:32,318
LATER IN THE HOUR, WE'LL BE

164
00:12:32,318 --> 00:12:39,859
TALKING PIT BULLS.

165
00:12:32,318 --> 00:12:39,859
WHO ARE THEY, WHAT DO THEY WANT

166
00:12:32,318 --> 00:12:39,859
FROM US, AND HOW ARE THEY SO

167
00:12:39,859 --> 00:12:43,630
YOLKED?

168
00:12:39,859 --> 00:12:43,630
BUT FIRST, IT'S TIME FOR

169
00:12:39,859 --> 00:12:43,630
CUISINE WITH FRANCINE.

170
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:49,436

171
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:49,436
FRANCINE IS BACK.

172
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:49,436
ME TOO, AS I'M SURE MOST OF

173
00:12:49,436 --> 00:12:56,543
OUR VIEWERS KNOW, FRANCINE WAS

174
00:12:49,436 --> 00:12:56,543
GONE YESTERDAY BECAUSE SHE GOT

175
00:12:49,436 --> 00:12:56,543
STUCK ON A RUN AWAY ROLLER

176
00:12:56,543 --> 00:13:02,048
COASTER GOING 150 MILES AN HOUR

177
00:12:56,543 --> 00:13:02,048
FOR 19 HOURS STRAIGHT.

178
00:12:56,543 --> 00:13:02,048
NOW SHE'S BACK BETTER THAN

179
00:13:02,048 --> 00:13:06,319
EVER AND NOT THE LEAST BIT PHASED.

180
00:13:02,048 --> 00:13:06,319
HI, FRANCINE!

181
00:13:06,319 --> 00:13:13,493

WOW, FRANCINE.

00:13:18,932 --> 00:13:25,138
YOU LOOK NUTS.

188
00:13:18,932 --> 00:13:25,138
DID YOU COME HERE STRAIGHT

189
00:13:18,932 --> 00:13:25,138

190
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:29,776
SURE DID.

191
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:29,776
COULDN'T BE LATE TO BE BACK IN

192
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:29,776
THE STUDIO.

193
00:13:29,776 --> 00:13:34,080
WELL, THAT'S GREAT.

194
00:13:29,776 --> 00:13:34,080
SO WHAT'S ON THE MENU TODAY,

195
00:13:29,776 --> 00:13:34,080

197
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:41,154
PASSPORTS READY BECAUSE TODAY

00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:52,465
CULTURE ADVENTURE THAT WILL HAVE

201
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:52,465
YOU SAYING MAMA MIA.

202
00:13:52,465 --> 00:14:01,041
TODAY, WE'RE EATING BUFFALO MOZZARELLA.

203
00:13:52,465 --> 00:14:01,041
CROSTINI, AND OF COURSE A GLASS

204
00:14:01,041 --> 00:14:10,417
OF CHIANTI.

205
00:14:01,041 --> 00:14:10,417
SALUD!

206
00:14:01,041 --> 00:14:10,417
NOW THAT'S GOOD VINO.

207
00:14:10,417 --> 00:14:18,491
LOOKS LIKE THAT HIT THE SPOT.

208
00:14:10,417 --> 00:14:18,491
AT LEAST THE PART THAT GOT IN.

209
00:14:18,491 --> 00:14:28,468
MM!

210
00:14:18,491 --> 00:14:28,468
REALLY COMPLEMENTS THE WINE.

211
00:14:18,491 --> 00:14:28,468
SO MANY TWISTS AND TURNS AS MY

212
00:14:28,468 --> 00:14:33,840
ROLLER COASTER RIDE FROM HELL.

213
00:14:28,468 --> 00:14:33,840
WHAT?

214
00:14:28,468 --> 00:14:33,840
I THINK SHE-- I THINK SHE

215
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:38,712
COMPARED THE WINE TO ALL THOSE

216
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:38,712
LOOP-DE-LOOPS.

217
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:38,712
WE ACTUALLY HAVE SOME VIDEO OF

218
00:14:38,712 --> 00:14:45,685
THAT.

219
00:14:38,712 --> 00:14:45,685
YEAH.

220
00:14:38,712 --> 00:14:45,685
MUST BE HARD TO WATCH, HUH,

221
00:14:45,685 --> 00:14:51,958
FRANCINE?

222
00:14:45,685 --> 00:14:51,958
WHAT WAS THAT?

223
00:14:45,685 --> 00:14:51,958
I COULDN'T HEAR YOU OVER THE

224
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:59,466
CRISPY CRUNCH OF MY CRISPY,

225
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:59,466
CRUNCHY, CROSTINI.

226
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:59,466
WELL, THANKS, FRANCINE.

227
00:14:59,466 --> 00:15:05,739
NOW IT'S TIME FOR THE WEATHER

228
00:14:59,466 --> 00:15:05,739
WITH OUR VERY OWN JASON BURRESS.

229
00:14:59,466 --> 00:15:05,739
HI, GUYS.

230
00:15:05,739 --> 00:15:13,813
IT LOOKS LIKE A DOOZY.

231
00:15:05,739 --> 00:15:13,813
OBVIOUSLY WE FORGOT TO

232
00:15:05,739 --> 00:15:13,813
MENTION THAT JASON WAS ALSO

233
00:15:13,813 --> 00:15:18,051
TRAPPED ON THE ROLLER COASTER.

234
00:15:13,813 --> 00:15:18,051
I ACTUALLY THINK WE HAVE A

235
00:15:13,813 --> 00:15:18,051
PICTURE OF THAT.

236
00:15:18,051 --> 00:15:23,456
OH.

237
00:15:18,051 --> 00:15:23,456
SO HOW'S THE WEATHER LOOKING,

238
00:15:18,051 --> 00:15:23,456
JASON?

239
00:15:23,456 --> 00:15:28,528
IT'S NOT GOOD AT ALL.

240
00:15:23,456 --> 00:15:28,528
WE HAVE SNOW COMING IN FROM THE EAST.

241
00:15:28,528 --> 00:15:31,531
UH-HUH.

242
00:15:28,528 --> 00:15:31,531
WE HAVE SNOW COMING IN FROM THE

243
00:15:28,528 --> 00:15:31,531
WEST, UH-HUH.

244
00:15:31,531 --> 00:15:37,671
SNOW FROM THE TOP, YEAH, AND

245
00:15:31,531 --> 00:15:37,671
SNOW FROM THE BOTTOM.

246
00:15:31,531 --> 00:15:37,671
LOOK, I'M DIZZY AS HELL FROM

247
00:15:37,671 --> 00:15:42,709
THAT ROLLER COASTER RIDE.

248
00:15:37,671 --> 00:15:42,709
WAIT A MINUTE.

249
00:15:37,671 --> 00:15:42,709
SOMETHING SURE SMELLS GOOD.

250
00:15:42,709 --> 00:15:48,648
OH, WHAT YOU COOKING OVER

251
00:15:42,709 --> 00:15:48,648
THERE, FRANCINE?

252
00:15:42,709 --> 00:15:48,648
JUST SOME MINESTRONE SOUP.

253
00:15:48,648 --> 00:15:55,555
BUT CAREFUL, IT'S HOT.

254
00:15:48,648 --> 00:15:55,555
YOU GOT TO BLOW ON IT. MM.

255
00:15:55,555 --> 00:16:08,702
THAT LOOKS DELICIOSO. MM.

256
00:15:55,555 --> 00:16:08,702
OH, MM, MM, MM.

257
00:16:08,702 --> 00:16:16,509
YES.

258
00:16:08,702 --> 00:16:16,509
GREAT.

259
00:16:08,702 --> 00:16:16,509
WELL, I GUESS YOU GUYS MUST

260
00:16:16,509 --> 00:16:20,647
BE PRETTY HUNGRY AFTER THAT

261
00:16:16,509 --> 00:16:20,647
CRAZY RIDE. YEAH.

262
00:16:20,647 --> 00:16:25,819
THE ONLY THING WE HAD TO EAT

263
00:16:20,647 --> 00:16:25,819
WERE THE BUGS THAT FLEW INTO OUR

264
00:16:20,647 --> 00:16:25,819
OPEN MOUTHS.

265
00:16:25,819 --> 00:16:35,395
YEAH.

266
00:16:25,819 --> 00:16:35,395
BUGS LIKE BUMBLEBEES, CICADAS,

267
00:16:25,819 --> 00:16:35,395
AND ONE DOG-SIZED BAT.

268
00:16:35,395 --> 00:16:44,104
NOW, THAT'S A SPICY MEATBALL.

269
00:16:35,395 --> 00:16:44,104
WOULD YOU CARE FOR SOME

270
00:16:35,395 --> 00:16:44,104
SPAGHETTI, JASON?

271
00:16:44,104 --> 00:16:48,575
OH, OKAY.

272
00:16:44,104 --> 00:16:48,575
OH, MY GOSH.

273
00:16:44,104 --> 00:16:48,575
YOU GUYS ARE SO CUTE TOGETHER.

274
00:16:48,575 --> 00:16:53,179
OF COURSE YOU PROBABLY GOT

275
00:16:48,575 --> 00:16:53,179
REAL CLOSE DURING YOUR TIME

276
00:16:48,575 --> 00:16:53,179
TOGETHER ON THE ROLLER COASTER.

277
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:57,550
WAIT.

278
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:57,550
WHAT ARE THEY DOING NOW?

279
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:57,550
I THINK THEY'RE DOING A

280
00:16:57,550 --> 00:17:08,161
LITTLE LADY AND THE TRAMP THING.

281
00:16:57,550 --> 00:17:08,161
AWW, SO ROMANTIC.

282
00:16:57,550 --> 00:17:08,161
I'M SORRY.

283
00:17:08,161 --> 00:17:11,931
FRANCINE, IS THERE SOMETHING

284
00:17:08,161 --> 00:17:11,931
UNDER YOUR SHIRT?

285
00:17:08,161 --> 00:17:11,931
OH, I ALMOST FORGOT.

286
00:17:11,931 --> 00:17:20,640
SAY HELLO TO MY LITTLE FRIEND.

287
00:17:11,931 --> 00:17:20,640
IS THAT A BIRD KICKING ITS

288
00:17:11,931 --> 00:17:20,640
LITTLE LEGS?

289
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:25,345
YEP.

290
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:25,345
HE FLEW STRAIGHT INTO HER

291
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:25,345
STOMACH AT 200 MILES AN HOUR.

292
00:17:25,345 --> 00:17:30,884
THE DOCTORS SAY IF I PULL IT

293
00:17:25,345 --> 00:17:30,884
OUT, BOTH OF US WILL DIE.

294
00:17:25,345 --> 00:17:30,884
NOW BACK TO YOU GUYS.

295
00:17:30,884 --> 00:17:35,689
ALL RIGHT.

296
00:17:30,884 --> 00:17:35,689
COMING UP NEXT, OUR EXCLUSIVE

297
00:17:30,884 --> 00:17:35,689
INTERVIEW WITH THE TEENAGE BOY

298
00:17:35,689 --> 00:17:42,062
WHO OPERATED THE ROLLER COASTER

299
00:17:35,689 --> 00:17:42,062
AND WHY HE DID NOTHING TO STOP IT.

300
00:17:42,062 --> 00:17:49,903
IT.

301
00:17:42,062 --> 00:17:49,903
TWO REASONS:TOO DUMB AND TOO HIGH.

302
00:17:57,210 --> 00:18:04,317
PRIDE OURSELVES ON A SMOOTH

303
00:17:57,210 --> 00:18:04,317
FLYING EXPERIENCE.

304
00:17:57,210 --> 00:18:04,317
OVER THE HOLIDAY SEASON, WE

305
00:18:04,317 --> 00:18:06,019
MESSED UP.

306
00:18:04,317 --> 00:18:06,019
OUR SYSTEM COLLAPSED, AND

307
00:18:04,317 --> 00:18:06,019
THOUSANDS OF FLYERS WERE LEFT

308
00:18:06,019 --> 00:18:10,790
STRANDED, AND YOU UNDERSTANDABLY

309
00:18:06,019 --> 00:18:10,790
SCREAMED AT US FOR DAYS ON END,

310
00:18:06,019 --> 00:18:10,790
EVEN MORE THAN YOU USUALLY DO.

311
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:21,034
AND SURE, WE LOST

312
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:21,034
$800 MILLION IN REV KNEW AND ARE

313
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:21,034
BEING INVESTIGATED BY THE FAA.

314
00:18:21,034 --> 00:18:28,475
FOR STARTERS, WE ARE FINALLY

315
00:18:21,034 --> 00:18:28,475
UPGRADING OUR ENTIRE COMPUTER

316
00:18:21,034 --> 00:18:28,475
SYSTEM TO 2008 DELL COMPUTERS.

317
00:18:28,475 --> 00:18:33,279
THAT'S RIGHT.

318
00:18:28,475 --> 00:18:33,279
WE ARE SAYING GOOD-BYE TO THOSE

WHAT WAS YOUR APPROACH?

1183
00:47:46,232 --> 00:47:54,774
WELL, SHE'S NOT A GIRLFRIEND.

1184
00:47:46,232 --> 00:47:54,774

01:03:03,750 --> 01:03:07,053
MICHAEL, I THINK YOU'RE SO

1659
01:03:07,053 --> 01:03:11,591

B. JORDAN.

1662
01:03:11,591 --> 01:03:17,364
THERE'S NO REASON TO BE NERVOUS.

1663
01:03:11,591 --> 01:03:17,364
WHEW, NO ONE SAW ME.

1664
01:03:11,591 --> 01:03:17,364
YOU OKAY THERE, BUD?

1665

01:03:20,900 --> 01:03:26,339
I WILL. OKAY.

1669
01:03:20,900 --> 01:03:26,339
LITTLE EMBARRASSING.

1670
01:03:26,339 --> 01:03:29,676
AT LEAST IT'S JUST ANDREW DISMUKES.

1671
01:03:26,339 --> 01:03:29,676
IT'S ALL GOOD.

I DIDN'T SEE YOU THERE.

1676
01:03:33,546 --> 01:03:37,083
LOOKED LIKE IT HURT.

1677
01:03:33,546 --> 01:03:37,083
IT DIDN'T REALLY.

1678
01:03:37,083 --> 01:03:43,723
LOOKED LIKE IT DID, THOUGH.

1679

NURSE, MICHAEL B. JORDAN JUST

1682
01:03:43,723 --> 01:03:48,828

HEY, MAN, I'M AT WORK.

1696
01:04:10,884 --> 01:04:14,888
YOU DON'T WANT ME TO SEE YOU

1697
01:04:14,888 --> 01:04:18,458
FALL DOWN, QUIT FALLING DOWN

1698
01:04:14,888 --> 01:04:18,458

1699
01:04:18,458 --> 01:04:21,327
JUST LEAVE ME ALONE.

1700
01:04:18,458 --> 01:04:21,327
ALL RIGHT, BUD.

ANDREW, SIT DOWN.

1705
01:04:28,468 --> 01:04:34,074
YOU HAVE TO STOP SEEING

1706
01:04:28,468 --> 01:04:34,074
MICHAEL B. JORDAN FALL DOWN.

1707
01:04:28,468 --> 01:04:34,074
I CAN'T HELP IT.

1708
01:04:34,074 --> 01:04:39,512
SOMETIMES HE FALLS, AND I SEE.

1709
01:04:34,074 --> 01:04:39,512
ANDREW, WHEN SOMEBODY FALLS

1710
01:04:34,074 --> 01:04:39,512
DOWN, YOU HAVE TO PRETEND LIKE

1711
01:04:39,512 --> 01:04:45,285
YOU DIDN'T SEE IT.

1712
01:04:39,512 --> 01:04:45,285
WELL, I DIDN'T KNOW THAT.

1713
01:04:39,512 --> 01:04:45,285
NOBODY TOLD ME THAT.

1714
01:04:45,285 --> 01:04:50,090
YOU CAN'T GET MAD AT ME FOR

1715
01:04:45,285 --> 01:04:50,090
SOMETHING I DIDN'T KNOW.

1716
01:04:45,285 --> 01:04:50,090
GUYS?

1717
01:04:50,090 --> 01:04:54,227
WHAT'S GOING ON?

1718
01:04:50,090 --> 01:04:54,227
NOTHING.

1719
01:04:50,090 --> 01:04:54,227
AND HEY, NEXT TIME YOU HAVE A

1720
01:04:54,227 --> 01:05:01,534
PROBLEM WITH ME, AT LEAST HAVE

1721
01:04:54,227 --> 01:05:01,534
THE KAHONES TO SAY IT TO MY FACE

1722
01:04:54,227 --> 01:05:01,534
INSTEAD OF SENDING YOUR LACKIES

1723
01:05:01,534 --> 01:05:08,241
TO DO YOUR DIRTY WORK FOR YOU.

1724
01:05:01,534 --> 01:05:08,241
I DIDN'T TELL THEM ANYTHING

1725
01:05:01,534 --> 01:05:08,241
EXCEPT YOU KEEP SEEING ME FALL.

1726
01:05:08,241 --> 01:05:12,812
WELL GUESS WHAT, SOMETIMES

1727
01:05:08,241 --> 01:05:12,812
YOU FALL, AND SOMETIMES I THERE.

1728
01:05:08,241 --> 01:05:12,812
WELL, THEN MAYBE YOU

1729
01:05:12,812 --> 01:05:16,616
SHOULDN'T BE AROUND ME AT ALL THEN.

1730
01:05:12,812 --> 01:05:16,616
MAYBE YOU SHOULD LEAVE AND NEVER

1731
01:05:16,616 --> 01:05:18,051
COME BACK.

1732
01:05:16,616 --> 01:05:18,051
WHATEVER, MAN.

1733
01:05:16,616 --> 01:05:18,051
I'M DONE.

1734
01:05:18,051 --> 01:05:25,058
DONE!

1735
01:05:18,051 --> 01:05:25,058
I COULDN'T BELIEVE WHAT I HAD

1736
01:05:25,058 --> 01:05:29,629
DONE.

1737
01:05:25,058 --> 01:05:29,629
I PUSHED AWAY MY BEST FRIEND AT

1738
01:05:25,058 --> 01:05:29,629
THE SHOW.

1739
01:05:29,629 --> 01:05:33,333
ANDREW DIS-MOE.

1740
01:05:29,629 --> 01:05:33,333
AFTER EVERYTHING WE HAVE BEEN THROUGH.

1741
01:05:33,333 --> 01:05:38,738
MONDAY PITCH IN LAUREN'S OFFICE,

1742
01:05:33,333 --> 01:05:38,738
TUESDAY WRITING NIGHT.

1743
01:05:33,333 --> 01:05:38,738
WHEN ANDREW GOT CUT FROM A

1744
01:05:38,738 --> 01:05:45,812
SKETCH BECAUSE HE DID A BAD JOB.

1745
01:05:38,738 --> 01:05:45,812
JUST TO THROW IT ALL AWAY

1746
01:05:38,738 --> 01:05:45,812
BECAUSE HE SAW ME FALL DOWN A

1747
01:05:45,812 --> 01:05:49,783
LOT?

1748
01:05:45,812 --> 01:05:49,783
THE SHOW WAS ABOUT TO START, BUT

1749
01:05:45,812 --> 01:05:49,783
I COULDN'T DO IT WITHOUT HIM.

1750
01:05:49,783 --> 01:05:55,255
DOES ANYONE HAVE EYES ON

1751
01:05:49,783 --> 01:05:55,255
MICHAEL B. JORDAN?

1752
01:05:49,783 --> 01:05:55,255
I KNEW THERE WAS ONLY ONE WAY

1753
01:05:55,255 --> 01:05:59,392
TO BRING HIM BACK.

1754
01:05:55,255 --> 01:05:59,392
I'M FALLING.

1755
01:05:55,255 --> 01:05:59,392
WHERE ARE YOU, ANDREW?

1756
01:05:59,392 --> 01:06:08,268
I'M RIGHT HERE.

1757

AND WE'RE NOT FALLING.

1758

WE'RE FLYING.

1759
01:06:08,268 --> 01:06:11,237
AND WE'RE NOT FALLING.

1760
01:06:08,268 --> 01:06:11,237
WE'RE FLYING.

1761
01:06:08,268 --> 01:06:11,237
WHOO!

1762
01:06:22,148 --> 01:06:27,187
I ALSO WANT TO THANK EVERYBODY HERE.

1763

1767
01:06:31,458 --> 01:06:33,660
I WANT TO THANK MY FAMILY

1768
01:06:31,458 --> 01:06:33,660

01:06:33,660 --> 01:06:37,430
I LOVE Y'ALL SO MUCH.

1770
01:06:33,660 --> 01:06:37,430
THIS IS AN INCREDIBLE EXPERIENCE.

1771
01:06:37,430 --> 01:06:40,633
THERE'S NOTHING LIKE IT IN THE WORLD.

1772
01:06:37,430 --> 01:06:40,633
I CAN'T WAIT TO COME BACK.

1773
01:06:40,633 --> 01:06:45,939
WHAT YOU GOT?

1774
01:06:40,633 --> 01:06:45,939
YOU AIN'T GOT NOTHING?

1775
01:06:40,633 --> 01:06:45,939
CAN'T WAIT TO DO IT AGAIN.

1776
01:06:45,939 --> 01:06:52,112
YOU AIN'T GOT NOTHING?

1777
01:06:45,939 --> 01:06:52,112
CAN'T WAIT TO DO IT AGAIN.
