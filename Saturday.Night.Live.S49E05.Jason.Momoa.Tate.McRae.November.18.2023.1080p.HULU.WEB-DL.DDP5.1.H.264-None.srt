1
00:00:01,456 --> 00:00:04,484
>>> WE NOW GO LIVE TO PRESIDENT
JOE BIDEN'S PRESS CONFERENCE

2
00:00:04,484 --> 00:00:08,608
AFTER HIS LONG-AWAITED MEETING
WITH CHINESE PRESIDENT XI
JINPING.

3
00:00:08,608 --> 00:00:11,140
>> HEY.

4
00:00:14,414 --> 00:00:16,023
HAPPY THANKSGIVING.

5
00:00:16,023 --> 00:00:19,984
IT'S ME, OUR OLD BOY JOE.
LET'S GET STARTED.

6
00:00:19,984 --> 00:00:24,674
TO KEEP THINGS ON THE RAILS, I'M
GOING TO READ FROM THE
TELEPROMPTER.

7
00:00:25,674 --> 00:00:30,027
OUR GREAT MEETING WITH PRESIDENT
ROMAN NUMERAL 11 --

8
00:00:30,027 --> 00:00:33,531
EXCUSE ME.
PRESIDENT XI.

9
00:00:33,531 --> 00:00:35,923
THIS MEETING WAS A TOTAL WIN.

10
00:00:35,923 --> 00:00:40,995
SURE, WE MADE AGREEMENTS ABOUT
COMMUNICATIONS, FENTANYL, CLIMATE CHANGE,

11
00:00:40,995 --> 00:00:45,195
BUT MOST
IMPORTANTLY, WE GOT THE THING
AMERICA REALLY NEEDS RIGHT NOW,

12
00:00:45,195 --> 00:00:47,671
MORE PANDAS.

13
00:00:48,671 --> 00:00:52,738
ALL RIGHT.
I LIKE TO OPEN UP TO QUESTIONS.

14
00:00:52,738 --> 00:00:55,325
FIRST UP, WALL STREET JOURNAL.

15
00:00:55,325 --> 00:00:57,243
>> THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT.

16
00:00:57,243 --> 00:00:59,501
CHINA RELATIONS BROKE OFF THIS PAST YEAR,

17
00:00:59,501 --> 00:01:02,261
PARTLY BECAUSE YOU
CALLED PRESIDENT XI A DICTATOR.

18
00:01:02,261 --> 00:01:03,852
>> YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.

19
00:01:03,852 --> 00:01:08,382
>> BUT YOUR SUMMIT LAST WEEK SAW
REMARKABLE STRIDES IN MENDING
THAT RELATIONSHIP.

20
00:01:08,382 --> 00:01:12,334
WOULD YOU LIKE TO COMPLETELY
UNDO YOUR ACCOMPLISHMENT BY
CALLING HIM A DICTATOR AGAIN?

21
00:01:12,334 --> 00:01:14,346
>> I WOULD.

22
00:01:14,346 --> 00:01:16,692
NEXT QUESTION, LA TIMES.

23
00:01:16,763 --> 00:01:18,100
>> THANK YOU MR. PRESIDENT

24
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:20,924
AND CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR HISTORIC
AND PRODUCTIVE SUMMIT.

25
00:01:20,924 --> 00:01:24,162
I HAVE A QUESTION.
YOU'RE OLD.

26
00:01:24,906 --> 00:01:29,434
>> OKAY.
ALL RIGHT.
I'M NOT SURE HOW THAT'S A
QUESTION.

27
00:01:29,434 --> 00:01:32,728
I MEAN, MAN, WHY CAN'T WE TALK
ABOUT THINGS THAT ARE GOING WELL

28
00:01:32,728 --> 00:01:37,663
LIKE THE ECONOMY?
WE OUTPACED CHINA FOR THE FIRST
TIME IN 40 YEARS.

29
00:01:37,663 --> 00:01:41,853
OR HOW I CREATED THE MOST JOBS
SINCE FDR.

30
00:01:41,853 --> 00:01:44,977
GO AHEAD.
WASHINGTON POST, ASK AWAY.

31
00:01:44,977 --> 00:01:48,889
>> MR. PRESIDENT, I WOULD LIKE
TO ASK YOU ABOUT THE HANDLING OF
THE BORDER CRISIS.

32
00:01:48,889 --> 00:01:52,357
>> OH, GOOD, YEA.
ALL RIGHT.

33
00:01:52,455 --> 00:01:55,830
THE BORDER.
ALL RIGHT.
I GOT TO GET SOMETHING.

34
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:59,763
LET ME TAKE THE ELEVATOR REAL
QUICK.
JUST ONE SECOND.

35
00:01:59,763 --> 00:02:01,535
SORRY.

36
00:02:01,535 --> 00:02:04,883
>> MR. PRESIDENT, DON'T DO A
FAKE ELEVATOR TO GET OUT OF
HERE.

37
00:02:04,883 --> 00:02:08,256
>> ALL RIGHT.
LET ME JUST TAKE IT BACK UP.

38
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:12,053
LITTLE BOUNCE.
ALL RIGHT.

39
00:02:12,053 --> 00:02:17,549
MOVE AWAY FROM THAT TOPIC BY
WELCOMING A VERY IMPORTANT
CHINESE DIGNITARY

40
00:02:17,549 --> 00:02:19,806
TO HELP SHED
LIGHT ON WHAT HAPPENED THIS
WEEK.

41
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:21,666
PLEASE WELCOME TIN TIN.

42
00:02:21,733 --> 00:02:24,964
>> HELLO.

43
00:02:24,964 --> 00:02:27,102
IT'S ME, TIN TIN.

44
00:02:27,102 --> 00:02:30,276
>> HI, TIN TIN.

45
00:02:30,276 --> 00:02:35,001
I'M GLAD YOU'RE HERE.
WE'RE ALL EXCITED TO HEAR FROM A
GIANT PANDA.

46
00:02:35,001 --> 00:02:36,769
>> OH, THAT'S SO SWEET.
THANK YOU.

47
00:02:36,769 --> 00:02:41,499
BUT NO NEED TO SAY GIANT.
I THINK I'M REALLY MORE
SLIM-THICK.

48
00:02:41,499 --> 00:02:42,697
>> OKAY.

49
00:02:42,697 --> 00:02:44,146
>> TRULY, I'M HONORED TO BE
HERE.

50
00:02:44,146 --> 00:02:49,476
AM I THE ONLY ONE THAT WAS
SURPRISED THAT THE PRESIDENTS OF
THE TWO BIGGEST ECONOMIES IN THE WORLD MET,

51
00:02:49,476 --> 00:02:52,887
AND EVERYONE'S JUST
LIKE, WHAT'S UP WITH THE PANDAS?

52
00:02:52,887 --> 00:02:58,217
I MEAN, I'M HOT, I'M SMART, I'M
ALLURINGLY ASEXUAL,

53
00:02:58,217 --> 00:03:00,703
BUT THERE
HAS TO BE BIGGER ISSUES, RIGHT?

54
00:03:00,703 --> 00:03:04,181
>> NOT TONIGHT.
NEXT QUESTION.
HOW ABOUT AXIOS?

55
00:03:04,181 --> 00:03:07,089
>> PRESIDENT BIDEN, TRUMP'S TEAM
HAS ANNOUNCED

56
00:03:07,089 --> 00:03:10,710
THEY WILL REPLACE
ALL FEDERAL WORKERS WERE TRUMP
LOYALISTS.

57
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:14,545
MY QUESTION IS -- PANDA, DID YOU
LIKE AMERICA?

58
00:03:14,545 --> 00:03:18,821
>> HONESTLY, I LOVED IT.
THERE'S SO MUCH I'M GOING TO
MISS.

59
00:03:18,821 --> 00:03:21,266
LEGAL WEED --

60
00:03:21,266 --> 00:03:26,059
ANYWAY, GOING BACK
TO CHINA, IT'S GOING TO BE A BIG
CHANGE.

61
00:03:26,059 --> 00:03:29,694
I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW ANYONE IN
CHINA.
I HAVEN'T BEEN BACK SINCE I WAS A BABY,

62
00:03:29,694 --> 00:03:33,232
AND NOW I HAVE TO MAKE
FRIENDS AS AN ADULT?
YUCK.

63
00:03:33,232 --> 00:03:37,916
HOW DO I PANDA EXPRESS THIS?

64
00:03:37,916 --> 00:03:42,042
I JUST WANT TO EAT BAMBOO,
SNEEZE IN A CUTE WAY,

65
00:03:42,042 --> 00:03:44,885
AND NOT
HAVE SEX.
OKAY?

66
00:03:44,885 --> 00:03:49,485
>> EXCUSE ME, PANDA, THAT'S
RIGHT, YOU REFUSE TO MATE IN THE
ZOO.

67
00:03:49,485 --> 00:03:51,909
WHY DON'T YOU LIKE SEX?

68
00:03:51,909 --> 00:03:56,468
>> HAVE YOU HAD IT?
IT'S CRAZY.

69
00:03:56,468 --> 00:03:57,789
NEXT QUESTION.

70
00:03:57,789 --> 00:04:02,816
>> ALL RIGHT.
AND THEY ALL DON'T HAVE TO BE
FOR THE PANDA.
LET'S GET ONE FOR ME.

71
00:04:02,816 --> 00:04:06,572
>> SURE.
LET'S TALK ABOUT YOUR MIDDLE
EAST POLICY.

72
00:04:06,651 --> 00:04:10,371
>> YOU KNOW, I THINK PEOPLE ARE
LIKING THE PANDA, RIGHT?

73
00:04:10,371 --> 00:04:11,909
NEXT QUESTION.

74
00:04:11,909 --> 00:04:15,899
>> XI DESCRIBED YOU PANDAS AS
ENVOYS OF FRIENDSHIP.

75
00:04:15,899 --> 00:04:17,386
HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THAT?

76
00:04:17,386 --> 00:04:21,528
>> SORRY.
BEAR WITH ME.
BEING CUTE.

77
00:04:22,205 --> 00:04:29,098
BUT AS THE RARE PERSON WHO
IDENTIFIES AS BLACK, WHITE, AND CHINESE,

78
00:04:29,098 --> 00:04:34,306
I FEEL LIKE I'M IN THE
UNIQUE POSITION TO UNITE MANY
PEOPLES OF THE WORLD.

79
00:04:34,306 --> 00:04:39,976
I'M JUST LIKE ANOTHER HOT
BLASIAN ICON, TIGER WOODS,

80
00:04:39,976 --> 00:04:44,000
EXCEPT FOR, AGAIN, I HATE SEX.

81
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,871
YES, YOU, SIR?
>> HEY, I THOUGHT I PICKED THE
REPORTERS.

82
00:04:47,871 --> 00:04:51,342
>> YEAH, BUT THE PANDA ALREADY
CHOSE ME.

83
00:04:51,342 --> 00:04:53,364
HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT RETURNING
TO CHINA?

84
00:04:53,364 --> 00:04:56,562
>> HONESTLY, I THINK THE TIMING
IS RIGHT.

85
00:04:56,562 --> 00:04:59,510
I HAVE TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY NOW,
YOU KNOW.

86
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:04,048
IF TRUMP GETS ELECTED IN 2024,
THAT WOULD BE A DISASTER.

87
00:05:04,048 --> 00:05:07,536
HE SAID HE'LL ROUND UP
IMMIGRANTS AND PUT THEM IN
CAMPS.

88
00:05:07,536 --> 00:05:11,265
DEMOCRACY MIGHT END.
THERE MIGHT BE A CIVIL WAR.

89
00:05:11,265 --> 00:05:14,518
>> SO YOU WILL VOTE FOR BIDEN?

90
00:05:17,382 --> 00:05:18,466
>> MM, MAYBE.

91
00:05:18,466 --> 00:05:19,776
>> WHAT THE HELL?
HEY, MAN.

92
00:05:19,776 --> 00:05:24,343
>> I'M KIDDING.
I'M A BEAR.
I CAN'T VOTE.

93
00:05:24,343 --> 00:05:27,559
>> ALL RIGHT.
LOOK, I'M GLAD WE DID THIS,
PANDA.

94
00:05:27,559 --> 00:05:29,774
NOW, YOU AND I REALLY AREN'T SO
DIFFERENT.

95
00:05:29,774 --> 00:05:31,781
WE'RE DADS, WE'RE CUTE,

96
00:05:31,781 --> 00:05:35,910
PEOPLE LOVE SHARING VIDEOS OF US
FALLING DOWN.

97
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:40,186
ANYTHING ELSE YOU WANT TO SAY
BEFORE YOUR 19-HOUR COACH FLIGHT
BACK TO CHINA?

98
00:05:40,186 --> 00:05:44,070
>> YEAH.
LIVE FROM NEW YORK, IT'S
SATURDAY NIGHT!

99
00:07:50,007 --> 00:07:55,068
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, JASON
MOMOA!

100
00:08:12,916 --> 00:08:17,420
>>> THANK YOU!
THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

101
00:08:18,003 --> 00:08:20,342
IT IS GREAT TO BE BACK AT SNL.

102
00:08:20,342 --> 00:08:24,801
IT MEANS SO MUCH TO ME.
MY MOM IS HERE.

103
00:08:26,456 --> 00:08:28,829
IF YOU SEE HER, BE CAREFUL,

104
00:08:28,829 --> 00:08:31,676
SHE'S STILL RECOVERING FROM
GIVING BIRTH TO ME.

105
00:08:31,676 --> 00:08:34,648
BUT I'M SO HAPPY TO BE HERE.
I LOVE THIS PLACE.

106
00:08:34,648 --> 00:08:37,401
I LOVE LIFE!
I LOVE --

107
00:08:37,401 --> 00:08:40,945
I LOVE WAKING UP WASHING MY
LUXURIOUS HAIR

108
00:08:40,945 --> 00:08:43,760
WITH A FULL BODY OF SHAMPOO,

109
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,742
AND I LOVE PLAYING
AQUA MAN.

110
00:08:47,011 --> 00:08:49,597
BECAUSE I LOVE THE OCEAN.
IT'S TRUE.

111
00:08:49,671 --> 00:08:52,475
GROWING UP, ALL I WANTED TO BE
WAS A MARINE BIOLOGIST,

112
00:08:52,475 --> 00:08:56,446
WHICH
MAKES SENSE BECAUSE I'M BUILT
LIKE A SCIENTIST.

113
00:08:56,535 --> 00:09:00,652
THE PROBLEM WAS THAT EVEN THOUGH
I WAS BORN IN HAWAII, I GREW UP IN IOWA,

114
00:09:00,652 --> 00:09:04,110
AND NOT REALLY KNOWN
FOR THEIR OCEANS.

115
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:06,089
THEN ONE DAY, I WAS SITTING AT
HOME

116
00:09:06,089 --> 00:09:09,712
WATCHING A MOVIE CALLED "IN GOD'S HANDS",
WHICH WAS SHOT IN HAWAII,

117
00:09:09,712 --> 00:09:14,415
AND I SAW MY COUSIN
BRIAN IN THESE 50 FOOT WAVES,

118
00:09:14,416 --> 00:09:16,901
IOWA

119
00:09:16,901 --> 00:09:19,613
SO
I WENT BACK TO HAWAII TO SURF
WITH MY FAMILY,

120
00:09:19,613 --> 00:09:23,785
AND I ENDED UP
GETTING ON A TV SHOW CALLED
BAYWATCH.

121
00:09:25,547 --> 00:09:27,857
I CALL IT THE B WORD.

122
00:09:27,857 --> 00:09:32,234
BUT I FELL IN LOVE WITH ACTING,
AND I ONLY STAYED FOR A FEW SEASONS

123
00:09:32,234 --> 00:09:35,304
BECAUSE YOU REALLY DON'T
WANT TO GET STUCK IN THE B HOLE.

124
00:09:37,809 --> 00:09:41,521
AND NOW I FEEL LIKE MY LIFE HAS
COME FULL CIRCLE.

125
00:09:41,521 --> 00:09:45,133
I DO A LOT OF WORK PROTECTING
OUR OCEANS AND SMALL ISLAND
NATIONS.

126
00:09:45,133 --> 00:09:50,335
I EVEN STARTED MY OWN WATER
COMPANY TO ELIMINATE SINGLE USE
PLASTIC WATER BOTTLES.

127
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:52,376
THANK YOU.

128
00:09:52,376 --> 00:09:58,364
IT'S CALLED -- WHICH IN HAWAIIAN
STANDS FOR SUCK IT DASANI.

129
00:09:58,951 --> 00:10:02,295
THIS WORK REALLY MEANS A LOT TO
ME.
I'M SERIOUS.

130
00:10:02,295 --> 00:10:05,263
WE'RE GOING TO SAVE THE WHALES,
THE CORAL REEF, THE SPONGEBOBS

131
00:10:05,337 --> 00:10:07,531
BECAUSE JASON MOMOA LOVES LIFE.

132
00:10:07,531 --> 00:10:10,324
THERE IS A SAYING --

133
00:10:13,082 --> 00:10:15,843
TAKE CARE OF THE EARTH, TAKE
CARE OF EACH OTHER.

134
00:10:15,843 --> 00:10:18,097
I AM JASON MOMOA.

135
00:10:18,097 --> 00:10:20,844
WE GOT A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU
TONIGHT.♪

MASTERS OF THE PEN

145

146

>> NO WORRIES.
I'M JUST BEING FUN.

147
00:11:14,916 --> 00:11:19,495

FOOTAGE.

>> INDEED. IT'S FROM THE EARLY 1900s,

149
00:11:21,813 --> 00:11:24,718
AN
AMATEUR FILM MAKER SHOT NEW YORK CITY,

150
00:11:24,718 --> 00:11:28,730
AND WE SPOTTED L. FRANK
BAUM IN THE BACKGROUND.

151
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:30,208
>> DID YOU BRING THE FOOTAGE?

152
00:11:30,208 --> 00:11:33,580
>> YOU KNOW WHAT, NO.
>> BOO.

153
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:36,118
>> I'M KIDDING, OF COURSE I
BROUGHT IT.

154
00:11:36,118 --> 00:11:36,962
SIDEWALK

155
00:11:36,962 --> 00:11:39,470
THIS IS FOOTAGE SHOT OUTSIDE A
STORE IN NEW YORK.

156
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:42,124
THE DATE'S UNKNOWN, BUT IT'S THE
EARLY 1900s.

157
00:11:42,124 --> 00:11:45,216
THAT MAN ON THE BENCH THERE IS
L. FRANK BAUM.

158
00:11:45,216 --> 00:11:48,247
>> OH, WOW.
SOMEONE JUST ZOOMED BY.

159
00:11:48,247 --> 00:11:50,838
THAT MAN WAS FAST.

160
00:11:50,936 --> 00:11:55,195
>> BACK THEN, FILM WAS SHOT AT A
LOWER FRAME RATE, SO EVERYTHING
LOOKED SPED UP.

161
00:11:55,195 --> 00:11:58,818
>> LOOKS LIKE MR. BAUM IS
WRITING SOMETHING.

162
00:11:58,818 --> 00:12:02,052
COULD HE BE WRITING THE WIZARD
OF OZ HERE?

163
00:12:02,052 --> 00:12:04,787
>> THERE ARE SOME CLUES THAT
MAKE US BELIEVE HE IS.

164
00:12:04,787 --> 00:12:08,857
IT'S HARD TO SEE BECAUSE THIS
BUSINESSMAN

165
00:12:08,857 --> 00:12:10,984
HAS NOTED THE
CAMERA.

166
00:12:10,984 --> 00:12:13,379
>> YEAH, HE SEEMS VERY EXCITED.

167
00:12:13,379 --> 00:12:16,931
>> WELL, A FILM CAMERA WAS A
RARE SIGHT BACK THEN,

168
00:12:16,931 --> 00:12:19,044
SO IT'S A
BIG DEAL FOR THIS MAN.

169
00:12:19,044 --> 00:12:22,079
ANYWAY, SO LOOK AT BAUM RIGHT
THERE.

170
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:23,957
HIS EYES SEEM TO WANDER IN THOUGHT,

171
00:12:23,957 --> 00:12:27,760
THEN HIS GAZE SETTLES
ON SOME SHOES IN THE STORE
WINDOW.

172
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,321
>> ARE THOSE SLIPPERS?

173
00:12:29,321 --> 00:12:33,900
IS THIS THE EXACT MOMENT HE GOT
THE IDEA FOR DOROTHY'S RUBY
SLIPPER --

174
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:35,833
>> WE'LL NEVER KNOW.

175
00:12:35,833 --> 00:12:39,689
THE BUSINESS GENTLEMAN HAS
BROUGHT HIS LARGE FRIEND TO SEE
THE CAMERA.

176
00:12:39,689 --> 00:12:44,175
>> THE LARGE FRIEND SEEMS VERY
HAPPY TO SEE THE CAMERA.

177
00:12:44,175 --> 00:12:47,354
>> YES.
HE'S CLEARLY VERY PUMPED.

178
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:52,531
ALL RIGHT.
MR. BAUM SEEMS TO BE TALKING TO
HIMSELF.

179
00:12:52,531 --> 00:12:54,418
ANY IDEA WHAT HE'S SAYING?

180
00:12:54,418 --> 00:12:58,659
>> WELL, THERE IS AI SOFTWARE TO
DECIPHER WHAT HE'S SAYING,

181
00:12:58,659 --> 00:13:02,306
BUT
WE WEREN'T ABLE TO USE IT

182
00:13:02,306 --> 00:13:05,004
BECAUSE THE BUSINESS GENTLEMAN
AND HIS FRIEND

183
00:13:05,004 --> 00:13:08,556
GOT AHOLD OF A
WOMAN'S HAT AND BLOCKED THE
BACKGROUND.

184
00:13:08,556 --> 00:13:12,702
>> THEY THINK THIS IS VERY
HILARIOUS.
>> YEAH.
YES, THEY DO.

185
00:13:12,702 --> 00:13:15,230
KEEP IN MIND, THIS IS THE EARLY 1900s,

186
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:18,672
SO THIS MIGHT BE THE MOST
FUN THESE PEOPLE HAVE IN THEIR
ENTIRE LIVES.

187
00:13:18,672 --> 00:13:22,069
>> WELL, I LOVE SEEING L. FRANK
BAUM.

188
00:13:22,069 --> 00:13:24,825
>> SO DO I.
AND --

189
00:13:25,022 --> 00:13:26,573
>> THIS WOMAN'S HERE NOW.

190

UNFORTUNATELY, SHE SEES THE
CAMERA TOO.

191
00:13:28,858 --> 00:13:34,063
>> WOW, SHE IS BLINKING FAST.
HOW DOES SHE DO THAT?

192
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:37,491
>> I JUST TOLD YOU THE FILM IS
SPED UP.

193
00:13:37,491 --> 00:13:39,439
OKAY.
THERE SHE GOES.

194
00:13:39,439 --> 00:13:44,299
>> OH.
NOW WHAT IS MR. BAUM LOOKING AT?
HE SEEMS INTRIGUED WHATEVER IT
IS.

195
00:13:44,299 --> 00:13:47,174
>> YES.
IT'S HARD TO TELL

196
00:13:47,174 --> 00:13:50,240
BECAUSE AN OLD
LADY WALKS BY, WHO'S --

197
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:54,118

198
00:13:54,118 --> 00:13:57,898

THING IN THE WORLD.
>> UH-HUH.

199
00:13:57,898 --> 00:14:01,798
SO HERE WE HAVE AN INCREDIBLE
MOMENT WITH MR. BAUM.

HE NOTICES THE CAMERA AND
APPROACHES WITH HIS NOTEBOOK.

201

DOES HE SHOW HIS NOTEBOOK TO THE
CAMERA?

MAYBE A DRAWING OF A SCARE CROW?

203

SUCCESSFUL MEETING WITH CHINA'S
PRESIDENT XI JINPING,

725
00:33:52,121 --> 00:33:55,926
REPORTERS
ASKED BIDEN IF HE STILL BELIEVED
XI WAS A DICTATOR,

726
00:33:55,926 --> 00:33:58,222
AND I DON'T
KNOW IF BIDEN WAS SUPPOSED TO SAY YES

727
00:33:58,222 --> 00:34:02,252
BECAUSE LOOK AT THIS
REACTION FROM SECRETARY OF STATE
ANTHONY BLINKEN.

728
00:34:02,253 --> 00:34:05,203
REFER
DICTATOR

729
00:34:05,203 --> 00:34:08,102
TERM EARLIER

THAT'S THE SAME FACE I MAKE WHEN
MY UNCLE STARTS A STORY

BY
MENTIONING THE RACE OF THE
WAITRESS.

733
00:34:23,781 --> 00:34:28,384
THAT'S ACTUALLY THE SAME FACE I
MADE WHEN I HEARD BIDEN SAY THIS
ABOUT LL COOL J.

734
00:34:28,384 --> 00:34:31,762
>> LLJ COOL J.

BICEPS BIGGER THAN MY THIGH.

I THINK THE SECOND J STANDS FOR
JESUS.

738

PRESIDENT BIDEN'S CHANCES FOR RE-ELECTION

739
00:34:52,997 --> 00:34:56,235
COULD BE DAMAGED BY
HIS UNWAVERING SUPPORT FOR ISRAEL,

740
00:34:56,235 --> 00:35:01,808
BUT I THINK THE BIGGER
PROBLEM IS HE IS SIX YEARS OLDER
THAN ISRAEL.

741
00:35:03,911 --> 00:35:08,178
THE HOUSE ETHICS COMMITTEE
RELEASED ITS REPORT ON GEORGE SANTOS

742
00:35:08,178 --> 00:35:11,834
SEEN HERE ASKING YOUR
GRANDMA FOR HER SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER

743
00:35:11,834 --> 00:35:14,922
AND CONCLUDED THAT THERE
IS SUBSTANTIAL EVIDENCE

744
00:35:14,922 --> 00:35:18,732
HE USED
CAMPAIGN FUNDS FOR SHOPPING AND
COSMETIC PROCEDURES.

745
00:35:18,732 --> 00:35:23,066
SANTOS WOULD HAVE DENIED THE
ALLEGATIONS, BUT HE HAD TO REST
HIS NEW LIPS.

746
00:35:24,873 --> 00:35:29,013
>> SEVERAL MAJOR MEDIA COMPANY,
INCLUDING NBC UNIVERSAL

747
00:35:29,013 --> 00:35:32,148
HAVE
PULLED THEIR ADVERTISING FROM ELON MUSK'S X

748
00:35:32,148 --> 00:35:37,063
OVER CONCERNS ADS
OF THEIR SHOWS COULD BE NEXT TO
PRO-NAZI PROPAGANDA.

00:35:46,051 --> 00:35:50,487
THIS WEEK, DONALD TRUMP JR.
TESTIFIED IN HIS FATHER'S CIVIL FRAUD TRIAL,

752
00:35:50,487 --> 00:35:54,071
AND BASED ON THIS
COURTROOM SKETCH, I FEEL LIKE IT
DIDN'T GO GREAT.

753
00:35:54,071 --> 00:35:56,563
HE'S SUPPOSED TO BE TALKING
ABOUT REAL ESTATE,

754
00:35:56,563 --> 00:36:00,998
BUT HE LOOKS
LIKE HE'S ON LAW AND ORDER
SAYING THAT GIRL CAME ON TO ME.

755
00:36:01,629 --> 00:36:05,912
UNLIKE THE OTHER PACKED
COURTROOM DAYS, ONLY FOUR PEOPLE SHOWED UP

756
00:36:05,912 --> 00:36:08,254
AND DONALD TRUMP SR.
YUZ NOT PRESENT,

757
00:36:08,254 --> 00:36:13,095
WHICH IS JUST
LIKE ALL DON JR.'S CHILDHOOD
BIRTHDAY PARTIES.

758
00:36:14,335 --> 00:36:18,707
>> THE SUPREME COURT
RECENT

759
00:36:18,707 --> 00:36:22,484
IS ADOPTING
A NEW CODE OF CONDUCT REPLACING
THEIR OLD CODE OF CONDUCT,

760
00:36:22,484 --> 00:36:25,405
MONEY
UP FRONT, NO KISSING ON THE
MOUTH.

761
00:36:25,405 --> 00:36:30,974
SENATOR TIM SCOTT ANNOUNCED HE
IS DROPPING OUT OF THE 2024
PRESIDENTIAL RACE.

762
00:36:30,974 --> 00:36:33,555
WITH SCOTT GONE, THE MOST
PROMINENT BLACK REPUBLICAN

763
00:36:33,555 --> 00:36:36,846
IS
ONCE AGAIN THE BLACKS FOR TRUMP
GUY.

764
00:36:36,846 --> 00:36:39,384
ALL RIGHT.
WHATEVER.

765
00:36:40,472 --> 00:36:43,858
>> A FIST FIGHT ALMOST BROKE OUT
AT A CONGRESSIONAL HEARING

766
00:36:43,858 --> 00:36:48,423
AFTER
MARK WAYNE MULLEN CHALLENGED THE
PRESIDENT OF THE TEAMSTERS TO A
FIST FIGHT.

767
00:36:48,424 --> 00:36:51,529
CHALLENGED TO FIGHT?

768
00:36:51,529 --> 00:36:52,993
DOES HE HAVE A DEATH WISH?

769
00:36:52,993 --> 00:36:57,157
THE TWO THINGS I LEARNED GROWING
UP IN NEW YORK WERE NEVER MESS
WITH THE TEAMSTERS,

770
00:36:57,157 --> 00:37:00,613
AND DON'T
DRINK THAT SNAPPLE YOU FOUND ON
THE SUBWAY.

771
00:37:01,591 --> 00:37:06,049
>> THE MAN WHO ATTACKED NANCY
PELOSI'S HUSBAND WITH A HAMMER
HAS BEEN FOUND GUILTY

772
00:37:06,049 --> 00:37:11,369
AND IS
EXPECTED TO BE IMPRISONED UNTIL
TRUMP'S FIRST DAY BACK AT
PRESIDENT.

773
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:17,270
HE GON' WIN.

774
00:37:18,031 --> 00:37:21,095
>> NEW YORK MAYOR ERIC ADAMS
RESPONDED TO ALLEGATIONS

775
00:37:21,095 --> 00:37:23,975
HE
ACCEPTED ILLEGAL DONATIONS FROM TURKEY SAYING

776
00:37:23,975 --> 00:37:27,695
I HAVE
NOT BEEN ACCUSED OF WRONG DOING,
AND I WILL CONTINUE TO
COOPERATE.

777
00:37:27,695 --> 00:37:32,532
THEN HE PUT ON HIS FEZ AND SPED
AWAY ON A FLYING CARPET.

778
00:37:34,469 --> 00:37:37,380
NASA RECENTLY DISCOVERED A TINY MOON

THIS HAS NOT BEEN A GOOD WEEK
FOR YOU.

783
00:37:57,019 --> 00:38:00,559

RELEASED A SCATHING REPORT ABOUT
YOU.

784
00:38:00,559 --> 00:38:02,316
>> OKAY.

785
00:38:02,316 --> 00:38:06,799

787
00:38:09,722 --> 00:38:13,654

788
00:38:13,654 --> 00:38:18,294

THEY'RE CALLING FOR YOUR
EXPULSION.

789
00:38:18,294 --> 00:38:21,404

00:51:14,572 --> 00:51:14,870
POTTY.

1119
00:51:14,872 --> 00:51:17,139
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO?

1120
00:51:17,141 --> 00:51:19,375
THAT'S HIM.

1121
00:51:19,377 --> 00:51:19,975
TRY AND BE NICE, OKAY?

1122
00:51:19,977 --> 00:51:22,011
HE WAS STRANDED ON THAT ISLAND

1123
00:51:22,013 --> 00:51:23,078
FOR FIVE YEARS.

1124
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:23,813
HE'S PROBABLY ALL MESSED UP AND

1125
00:51:23,815 --> 00:51:31,954
FRAIL.

1126
00:51:31,956 --> 00:51:32,588
LAIRD.

1127
00:51:32,590 --> 00:51:35,825
>> ELAINE.

1128
00:51:35,827 --> 00:51:38,494
>> YOU LOOK -- DIFFERENT.

1129
00:51:38,496 --> 00:51:41,864
>> THE ISLAND, IT CHANGED ME.

1130
00:51:41,866 --> 00:51:45,634
>> I CAN SEE THAT.

1131
00:51:45,636 --> 00:51:47,736
>> DIDN'T CHANGE EVERYTHING.

1132
00:51:47,738 --> 00:51:51,340
>> I CAN FEEL THAT.

1133
00:51:51,342 --> 00:51:55,611
>> UH, I'M DENNIS, BY THE WAY.

1134
00:51:55,613 --> 00:51:57,813
I'M ELAINE'S HUSBAND NOW.

1135
00:51:57,815 --> 00:52:02,651
SORRY IF THAT'S WEIRD OR

1136
00:52:02,653 --> 00:52:03,152
ANNOYING FOR YOU.

1137
00:52:03,154 --> 00:52:03,619
>> NOT AT ALL.

1138
00:52:03,621 --> 00:52:05,621
I'M GLAD ELAINE FOUND SOMEONE IN

1139
00:52:05,623 --> 00:52:07,356
MY ABSENCE.

1140
00:52:07,358 --> 00:52:10,492
SHE DESERVES TO BE HAPPY.

1141
00:52:10,494 --> 00:52:10,893
>> TOTALLY.

1142
00:52:10,895 --> 00:52:12,862
I'M ALWAYS SAYING STUFF LIKE

1143
00:52:12,864 --> 00:52:13,162
THAT.

1144
00:52:13,164 --> 00:52:14,530
SHE DESERVES TO BE HAPPY.

1145
00:52:14,532 --> 00:52:15,931
>> DON'T JUST STAND IN THE

1146
00:52:15,933 --> 00:52:16,832
DOORWAY, LAIRD.

1147
00:52:16,834 --> 00:52:18,734
COME, SIT DOWN.

1148
00:52:18,736 --> 00:52:21,136
>> WELL, I MUST SAY, YOU HAVE A

1149
00:52:21,138 --> 00:52:23,138
VERY LOVELY HOUSE, ELAINE.

1150
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:26,308
>> AND DENNIS.

1151
00:52:26,310 --> 00:52:28,544
IT'S BOTH OF OURS.

1152
00:52:28,546 --> 00:52:30,179
WE LIVE HERE TOGETHER AND MAKE

1153
00:52:30,181 --> 00:52:31,814
LOVE OFTEN AND IN ALL THE

1154
00:52:31,816 --> 00:52:32,214
POSITIONS.

1155
00:52:32,216 --> 00:52:33,482
>> DENNIS, YOU'RE BEING SO

1156
00:52:33,484 --> 00:52:35,351
WEIRD, AND THAT'S NOT EVEN TRUE.

1157
00:52:35,353 --> 00:52:37,019
WE MAKE LOVE IN ONE POSITION.

1158
00:52:37,021 --> 00:52:39,321
>> SIDE TO SIDE, BOTH LAYING

1159
00:52:39,323 --> 00:52:39,622
DOWN.

1160
00:52:39,624 --> 00:52:43,492
THAT WAY EVERYONE CAN RELAX.

1161
00:52:43,494 --> 00:52:47,596
>> GOD, WE'RE BEING SO RUDE.

1162
00:52:47,598 --> 00:52:49,465
LAIRD, PLEASE, HAVE SOME WINE.

1163
00:52:49,467 --> 00:52:52,001
TONIGHT IS A CELEBRATION.

1164
00:52:52,003 --> 00:52:54,103
>> IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME SINCE

1165
00:52:54,105 --> 00:52:57,539
I'VE HAD WINE.

1166
00:52:57,541 --> 00:52:59,775
TO OLD REKINDLING FLAMES.

1167
00:52:59,777 --> 00:53:01,944
>> TO OLD REKINDLING FLAMES.

1168
00:53:01,946 --> 00:53:13,122
>> BUT AND TO LOYALTY.

1169
00:53:13,124 --> 00:53:15,791
>> OH, I'M SORRY.

1170
00:53:15,793 --> 00:53:16,525
I FORGOT HOW TO DRINK OUT OF A

1171
00:53:16,527 --> 00:53:18,794
CUP.

1172
00:53:18,796 --> 00:53:25,167
I MUST TAKE MY SHIRT OFF.

1173
00:53:25,169 --> 00:53:25,801
>> NO.

1174
00:53:25,803 --> 00:53:27,636
WE ACTUALLY HAVE A SHIRTS ON IN

1175
00:53:27,638 --> 00:53:28,203
THE HOUSE RULE.

1176
00:53:28,205 --> 00:53:31,173
>> NO, NO, WE DON'T.

1177
00:53:31,175 --> 00:53:32,074
>> OKAY.

1178
00:53:32,076 --> 00:53:32,841
COOL.

1179
00:53:32,843 --> 00:53:33,542
WELL, THEN I'LL TAKE OFF MINE

1180
00:53:33,544 --> 00:53:39,848

1181
00:53:39,850 --> 00:53:41,984
>> EWW.

1182
00:53:41,986 --> 00:53:43,185
>> DON'T SAY EWW.

1183
00:53:43,187 --> 00:53:44,219
>> LAIRD, LET ME TAKE YOUR

1184
00:53:44,221 --> 00:53:46,522
SHIRT.

1185
00:53:46,524 --> 00:53:55,331
I'LL THROW IT IN THE WASH.

1186
00:54:05,443 --> 00:54:07,543
>> SO HOW DID YOU PASS THE TIME

1187
00:54:07,545 --> 00:54:08,610
ON THAT ISLAND?

1188
00:54:08,612 --> 00:54:11,213
PROBABLY YANKED IT A LOT.

1189
00:54:11,215 --> 00:54:14,483
>> NOT ONCE.

1190
00:54:14,485 --> 00:54:16,251
>> YOU BOYS GETTING ALONG?

1191
00:54:16,253 --> 00:54:16,952

00:54:19,657 --> 00:54:20,456
>> WHAT?

1195
00:54:20,458 --> 00:54:21,490
BUT HE JUST GOT HERE.

1196
00:54:21,492 --> 00:54:23,092
>> IT'S OKAY, ELAINE.

1197
00:54:23,094 --> 00:54:27,296
SOMETIMES I LOSE TRACK OF TIME.

1198
00:54:27,298 --> 00:54:29,832
I SUPPOSE IT'S IRONIC THAT MY

1199
00:54:29,834 --> 00:54:31,834
WHOLE LIFE HAS BEEN DICTATED BY

1200
00:54:31,836 --> 00:54:32,368
THE CLOCK.

1201
00:54:32,370 --> 00:54:33,869
ON THAT ISLAND, THE ONLY THING

1202
00:54:33,871 --> 00:54:37,940
THAT MATTERED WAS SURVIVAL.

1203
00:54:37,942 --> 00:54:38,273
>> OH.

1204
00:54:38,275 --> 00:54:39,975
>> THE SIZE OF THE FIRE I COULD

1205
00:54:39,977 --> 00:54:41,410
BUILD WITH MY OWN HANDS.

1206
00:54:41,412 --> 00:54:42,177
>> OOH.

1207
00:54:42,179 --> 00:54:44,079
>> THE PRIMITIVE SKILLS I COULD

1208
00:54:44,081 --> 00:54:44,613
SUMMON TO HUNT.

1209
00:54:44,615 --> 00:54:47,816
>> I KNOW YOU WERE ON AN ISLAND,

1210
00:54:47,818 --> 00:54:50,019
LAIRD, BUT I WAS ON AN ISLAND

1211
00:54:50,021 --> 00:54:50,319
TOO.

1212
00:54:50,321 --> 00:54:53,856
>> IN WHAT WAY?

1213
00:54:53,858 --> 00:54:55,958
>> YOU'RE NOT ALONE ANYMORE.

1214
00:54:55,960 --> 00:54:56,825
>> OKAY.

1215
00:54:56,827 --> 00:54:58,794
I THINK YOU SHOULD GET OUT OF

1216
00:54:58,796 --> 00:55:01,563
HERE BEFORE I KICK YOUR ASS.

1217
00:55:01,565 --> 00:55:03,032
>> WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?

1218
00:55:03,034 --> 00:55:04,266
LAIRD IS OUR GUEST.

1219
00:55:04,268 --> 00:55:05,267

>> WINNER GETS ELAINE.

1223
00:55:09,073 --> 00:55:11,340
>> DENNIS, THAT'S INSANE.

1224
00:55:11,342 --> 00:55:12,041
WINNER SHOULD GET ME AND THE

1225
00:55:12,043 --> 00:55:13,509
HOUSE.

1226
00:55:13,511 --> 00:55:17,780
>> I ACCEPT THOSE TERMS.

1227
00:55:17,782 --> 00:55:18,480
>> THEN GENTLEMEN, GET IN THE

1228
00:55:18,482 --> 00:55:24,486
POSITION.

1229
00:55:24,488 --> 00:55:33,462
ON MY MARK, GO!

1230

00:55:38,769 --> 00:55:42,571
NOW THAT I'VE BEEN BEATEN AND

1233
00:55:42,573 --> 00:55:44,506
HUMILIATED, I FEEL TOTALLY ALONE

1234
00:55:44,508 --> 00:55:45,574
AND ISOLATED.

1235
00:55:45,576 --> 00:55:47,976
GUESS IN A WAY, I ALSO KNOW WHAT

1236
00:55:47,978 --> 00:55:49,211
IT'S LIKE TO BE ON AN ISLAND,

1452
01:04:52,389 --> 01:04:53,521
>> WELL, THAT MAKES SENSE.

1453
01:04:53,523 --> 01:04:55,824
I'M EATING A BUNCH OF SHRIMP AND

1454
01:04:55,826 --> 01:04:56,658
HAM RIGHT NOW.

1455
01:04:56,660 --> 01:05:00,028
>> ON THE POSITIVE SIDE, YOU'RE

1456
01:05:00,030 --> 01:05:00,962
POSITIVE FOR HERPES.

1457
01:05:00,964 --> 01:05:03,231
>> EVERYBODY'S GOT THAT.

1458
01:05:03,233 --> 01:05:05,533
AIN'T THAT RIGHT, PAL.

1459
01:05:05,535 --> 01:05:07,936
>> I AM BEGGING YOU TO TAKE IT

1460
01:05:07,938 --> 01:05:08,670
OFF SPEAKER.

1461
01:05:08,672 --> 01:05:11,539
>> LASTLY, YOU HAVE SOMETHING

1462
01:05:11,541 --> 01:05:12,907
WE'RE CALLING HEPATITIS GOLD.

1463
01:05:12,909 --> 01:05:14,642
>> I LIKE THE SOUND OF THAT.

1464
01:05:14,644 --> 01:05:18,046
>> WELL, YOU SHOULDN'T.

1465
01:05:18,048 --> 01:05:18,980
>> WHAT IF WE JUST LET ME OUT ON

1466
01:05:18,982 --> 01:05:19,447
THIS HIGHWAY.

1467
01:05:19,449 --> 01:05:21,182
>> JUST TALKING TO MY DOCTOR.

1468
01:05:21,184 --> 01:05:22,217
ANYTHING ELSE?

1469
01:05:22,219 --> 01:05:25,020
>> YOU ALSO ASKED ME ABOUT THE

1470
01:05:25,022 --> 01:05:25,320
E.D.

1471
01:05:25,322 --> 01:05:26,554
>> EMPTY DIAPERS?

1472
01:05:26,556 --> 01:05:32,227
>> I WAS TALKING ABOUT ERECTILE

1473
01:05:32,229 --> 01:05:33,795
DYSFUNCTION, BUT WE CAN SKIP

1474
01:05:33,797 --> 01:05:34,095
AHEAD.

1475
01:05:34,097 --> 01:05:35,830
SHORT ANSWERS ARE THE DIAPERS

1476
01:05:35,832 --> 01:05:38,867
ARE EMPTY BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT

1477
01:05:38,869 --> 01:05:40,535
PUTTING THEM ON.

1478
01:05:40,537 --> 01:05:42,170
THAT'S WHY EVERYTHING IS

1479
01:05:42,172 --> 01:05:42,971
SHOOTING STRAIGHT INTO THE PAN.

1480
01:05:42,973 --> 01:05:43,938
>> DO YOU HAVE A PEN?

1481
01:05:43,940 --> 01:05:46,107
I FEEL LIKE I SHOULD BE WRITING

1482
01:05:46,109 --> 01:05:46,508
THIS DOWN.

1483
01:05:46,510 --> 01:05:48,376
>> NO.

1484
01:05:48,378 --> 01:05:49,644
SERIOUSLY, THIS IS NOT OKAY.

1485
01:05:49,646 --> 01:05:50,979
>> YOU HAVE LOW BLOOD SUGAR.

1486
01:05:50,981 --> 01:05:52,213
>> WELL, THAT'S A RELIEF.

1487
01:05:52,215 --> 01:05:52,714
>> WHAT IS?

1488
01:05:52,716 --> 01:05:55,950
>> WELL, I THOUGHT I HAD LOW

1489
01:05:55,952 --> 01:05:56,251
BLOOD.

1490
01:05:56,253 --> 01:06:02,023
I HEARD IT FROM A SOUTHERN SASSY

1491
01:06:02,025 --> 01:06:04,259
LADY WHO SAID, YOU GOOD LOW

1492
01:06:04,261 --> 01:06:05,126
BLOOD, SUGAR.

1493
01:06:05,128 --> 01:06:08,196
AND GOING BACK TO THE WEINER

1494
01:06:08,198 --> 01:06:09,964
STUFF?

1495
01:06:09,966 --> 01:06:13,134
>> SO WE RAN SOME TESTS ON YOUR

1496
01:06:13,136 --> 01:06:14,869
PENIS, AND IT'S NEGATIVE, LIKE

1497
01:06:14,871 --> 01:06:15,503
NEGATIVE IN LENGTH.

1498
01:06:15,505 --> 01:06:18,073
>> THAT EXPLAINS A LOT, OR I

1499
01:06:18,075 --> 01:06:19,040
GUESS I SHOULD SAY A LITTLE.

1500
01:06:19,042 --> 01:06:21,242
>> DO NOT HIGH FIVE ME.

1501
01:06:21,244 --> 01:06:22,944
>> ARE YOU SEXUALLY ACTIVE?

1502
01:06:22,946 --> 01:06:24,312
>> ACTIVE?

1503
01:06:24,314 --> 01:06:24,579
NO.

1504
01:06:24,581 --> 01:06:25,847
I JUST KIND OF LIE THERE.

1505
01:06:25,849 --> 01:06:27,515
>> YOU KNOW WHAT, I'M JUST GOING

1506
01:06:27,517 --> 01:06:28,683
TO PUT ON A PODCAST.

1507
01:06:28,685 --> 01:06:30,718
>> PAIRING WITH CAB DRIVER'S

1508
01:06:30,720 --> 01:06:31,019
PHONE.

1509
01:06:31,021 --> 01:06:32,720
>> HOW?

1510
01:06:32,722 --> 01:06:33,655
>> JUST A FEW MORE QUESTIONS.

1511
01:06:33,657 --> 01:06:34,856
>> AH!

1512
01:06:34,858 --> 01:06:38,226
>> I'M NOTICING YOU HAVE SOME

1513
01:06:38,228 --> 01:06:40,261
MISSING INFORMATION ON YOUR

1514
01:06:40,263 --> 01:06:40,562
CHART.

1515
01:06:40,564 --> 01:06:43,832
CAN I ASK YOU ABOUT YOUR FAMILY

1516
01:06:43,834 --> 01:06:44,165
HISTORY?

1517
01:06:44,167 --> 01:06:47,802
>> MOM AND DAD DID IT, AND I

1518
01:06:47,804 --> 01:06:49,270
CAME OUT FIVE MONTHS LATER.

1519
01:06:49,272 --> 01:06:51,940
>> FIVE MONTHS?

1520
01:06:51,942 --> 01:06:53,942
>> THAT'S WHY THEY CALL ME LIL

1521
01:06:53,944 --> 01:06:54,275
SQUIRT.

1522
01:06:54,277 --> 01:06:54,676
HIGH FIVE.

1523
01:06:54,678 --> 01:06:55,143
>> I SAID NO.

1524
01:06:55,145 --> 01:06:56,945
>> HOW MANY DRINKS DO YOU HAVE

1525
01:06:56,947 --> 01:06:57,445
PER NIGHT?

1526
01:06:57,447 --> 01:06:59,848
>> WHAT'S THAT, A HOLIDAY FOR

1527
01:06:59,850 --> 01:07:00,148
CATS?

1528
01:07:00,150 --> 01:07:01,416
>> NOT PURR LIKE A CAT.

1529
01:07:01,418 --> 01:07:02,817
SHE'S ASKING YOU HOW MANY DRINKS

1530
01:07:02,819 --> 01:07:03,651
YOU HAVE IN A WEEK.

1531
01:07:03,653 --> 01:07:05,286
>> OH, ZERO.

1532
01:07:05,288 --> 01:07:06,287
UNLESS YOU'RE COUNTING RUM.

1533
01:07:06,289 --> 01:07:06,721
>> WELL, YEAH.

1534
01:07:06,723 --> 01:07:10,225
>> THEN A THOUSAND.

1535
01:07:10,227 --> 01:07:11,559
>> PULL OVER.

1536
01:07:11,561 --> 01:07:14,696
>> ALSO, YOUR VISION TEST CAME

1537
01:07:14,698 --> 01:07:17,265
BACK, AND I'M AFRAID TO SAY

1538
01:07:17,267 --> 01:07:19,434
YOU'RE LEGALLY BLIND.

1539
01:07:19,436 --> 01:07:21,836
>> LIKE REESE WITHERSPOON?

1540
01:07:21,838 --> 01:07:25,140
>> THAT IS LEGALLY BLOND, YOU

1541
01:07:25,142 --> 01:07:25,440
DUMMY.

1542
01:07:25,442 --> 01:07:26,774
DOCTOR, HOW HARD IS IT TO JUMP

1543
01:07:26,776 --> 01:07:28,476
FROM A MOVING CAB AND LIVE?

1544
01:07:28,478 --> 01:07:31,579
>> THAT'S NOT MY AREA, BUT HOW

1545
01:07:31,581 --> 01:07:32,113
FAST ARE YOU GOING?

1546

1548
01:07:34,284 --> 01:07:36,217
YOU KNOW WHAT, THAT'S IT.

1549
01:07:36,219 --> 01:07:37,218
I'M OUT OF HERE.

1550
01:07:37,220 --> 01:07:47,428
