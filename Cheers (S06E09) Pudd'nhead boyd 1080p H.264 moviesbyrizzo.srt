1
00:00:01,838 --> 00:00:05,757
Cliff: "CHEERS" IS FILMED
BEFORE A LIVE STUDIO AUDIENCE.

2
00:00:07,241 --> 00:00:08,693
WHOO! SORRY I'M LATE.

3
00:00:08,693 --> 00:00:11,386
BOY, YOU WILL NOT BELIEVE
WHAT HAPPENED TO ME.

4
00:00:11,386 --> 00:00:15,838
I MADE A RIGHT-HAND
TURN ONTO BOYLSTON
AND RAN INTO THIS
STUPID PARADE.

5
00:00:15,838 --> 00:00:17,846
THEN MY CAR BACKFIRED

6
00:00:17,846 --> 00:00:23,312
AND SCARED THE TAR OUT OF
THESE TWO CUTE, LITTLE
POODLES IN TUTUS
WHO WERE DANCING BY.

7
00:00:23,762 --> 00:00:25,775
DANCING POODLES.

8
00:00:25,775 --> 00:00:29,168
YEAH. ANYWAY, THE DOGS
SPOOKED AND RAN AWAY,

9
00:00:29,168 --> 00:00:32,076
AND THIS CUTE LITTLE GIRL
IN BLUE SEQUINS
RAN AFTER THEM

10
00:00:32,076 --> 00:00:35,969
RIGHT IN FRONT OF THIS
LITTLE CAR
FULL OF CLOWNS
THAT SWERVED
TO MISS HER,

11
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:38,423
AND THE CAR RAN RIGHT
IN FRONT OF THIS ELEPHANT.

12
00:00:38,423 --> 00:00:44,415
THE ELEPHANT REARED UP,
THREW THIS SWAMI GUY OFF
WHO WAS RIDING
ON HIS TUSK.

13
00:00:44,415 --> 00:00:48,305
SAM, THIS IS THE LAMEST EXCUSE
YOU'VE EVER GIVEN ME.

14
00:00:48,305 --> 00:00:52,918
WHY DON'T YOU JUST SAY,
"I'M SORRY, REBECCA.
I OVERSLEPT.
IT WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN."

15
00:00:52,918 --> 00:00:54,750
THAT REALLY
MAKES ME...

16
00:01:02,964 --> 00:01:07,099
I'M SORRY, REBECCA.
I JUST OVERSLEPT.
IT WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN.

17
00:01:11,607 --> 00:01:14,596
* MAKIN' YOUR WAY
IN THE WORLD TODAY *

18
00:01:14,596 --> 00:01:17,153
* TAKES EVERYTHING
YOU'VE GOT *

19
00:01:17,153 --> 00:01:20,154
* TAKIN' A BREAK
FROM ALL YOUR WORRIES *

20
00:01:20,154 --> 00:01:23,024
* SURE WOULD
HELP A LOT *

21
00:01:23,196 --> 00:01:27,522
* WOULDN'T YOU LIKE
TO GET AWAY? *

22
00:01:29,097 --> 00:01:31,539
* SOMETIMES
YOU WANT TO GO *

23
00:01:31,539 --> 00:01:35,873
* WHERE EVERYBODY
KNOWS YOUR NAME *

24
00:01:36,279 --> 00:01:40,856
* AND THEY'RE ALWAYS
GLAD YOU CAME *

25
00:01:41,333 --> 00:01:43,911
* YOU WANT TO BE
WHERE YOU CAN SEE *

26
00:01:43,911 --> 00:01:46,400
* OUR TROUBLES
ARE ALL THE SAME *

27
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:51,425
* YOU WANT TO BE *
* WHERE EVERYBODY
KNOWS YOUR NAME *

28
00:01:51,706 --> 00:01:54,258
* YOU WANT TO GO
WHERE PEOPLE KNOW *

29
00:01:54,258 --> 00:01:56,775
* PEOPLE ARE
ALL THE SAME *

30
00:01:56,775 --> 00:02:02,101
* YOU WANT TO GO *
* WHERE EVERYBODY
KNOWS YOUR NAME *

31
00:02:21,109 --> 00:02:23,400
FRASIER, I'M
DOUBLE-PARKED OUTSIDE.

32
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,986
FINISH YOUR DRINK,
AND LET'S GO.

33
00:02:24,986 --> 00:02:27,045
IN A MINUTE.
I'VE JUST
TOUCHED MY GLASS.

34
00:02:27,045 --> 00:02:29,344
DON'T BALK, JELLY BEAR.

35
00:02:29,718 --> 00:02:33,140
I'M NOT BALKING,
MOON-PIE.

36
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,354
I'M SIMPLY TRYING
TO FINISH MY DRINK.

37
00:02:36,354 --> 00:02:39,323
YOU'D UNDERSTAND
IF YOU'D HAD AS
TRYING A DAY
AS I'VE HAD.

38
00:02:39,323 --> 00:02:40,922
THE KIND OF DAY
YOU'VE HAD?

39
00:02:40,922 --> 00:02:42,985
LORD, IF I HEAR
ONE MORE YUPPIE

40
00:02:42,985 --> 00:02:46,697
SNIVEL ABOUT HIS
INABILITY TO LOVE,
I'LL SMACK HIM.

41
00:02:47,321 --> 00:02:50,835
BOO-HOO-HOO-HOO-HOO.

42
00:02:50,835 --> 00:02:52,935
I SAW NINE CLIENTS
TODAY WITH NO LUNCH.

43
00:02:52,935 --> 00:02:55,951
I SAW 10. 15, IF YOU COUNT
MULTIPLE PERSONALITIES.

44
00:02:55,951 --> 00:02:57,110
OH, YEAH? WELL,
YOU SHOULD HAVE--

45
00:02:57,110 --> 00:03:00,185
HEY, HEY,
COME ON, PLEASE.
YOU'RE
A LITTLE TENSE.

46
00:03:00,185 --> 00:03:04,101
YOU GOT TO RELAX,
TAKE A FEW DAYS OFF,
YOU KNOW,
MAYBE A VACATION
OR SOMETHING.

47
00:03:04,101 --> 00:03:07,176
VACATION? HA!
YOU MAKE IT SOUND
SO EASY, SAM,

48
00:03:07,176 --> 00:03:09,412
AS IF ONE COULD
PICK UP JUST LIKE THAT.

49
00:03:09,412 --> 00:03:12,005
WE ARE PROFESSIONALS
WITH COMMITMENTS
AND OBLIGATIONS.

50
00:03:12,005 --> 00:03:13,545
OUR PATIENTS
DEPEND UPON US.

51
00:03:13,545 --> 00:03:15,455
I'LL CLEAR MY SCHEDULE
IF YOU WILL.

52
00:03:15,455 --> 00:03:17,724
- NASSAU OR SAINT THOMAS?
- LET'S GO TALK TO
THE TRAVEL AGENT.

53
00:03:17,724 --> 00:03:19,941
THERE YOU GO.
HAVE A GOOD TIME.

54
00:03:19,941 --> 00:03:23,092
HAS ANYBODY SEEN
WOODY?
HE WAS SCHEDULED
TO BE HERE AT 6:00.

55
00:03:23,092 --> 00:03:23,986
HE'S GONNA BE LATE.

56
00:03:23,986 --> 00:03:27,476
GOOD GOD, PEOPLE!
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHY I BOTHER
TO PREPARE A WORK SCHEDULE.

57
00:03:27,476 --> 00:03:30,130
EVERYBODY JUST COMES AND GOES
AS THEY DAMN WELL PLEASE.

58
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:32,594
YEAH. HE DID SEND THESE,
THOUGH.

59
00:03:32,594 --> 00:03:35,552
"I'M SORRY I'M LATE.
PLEASE DOCK MY PAY."

60
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:38,735
NOW, THIS IS
THE WAY TO BE LATE.

61
00:03:40,588 --> 00:03:44,346
WHERE IS THE LITTLE...
ANYWAY?

62
00:03:44,346 --> 00:03:46,464
I DON'T KNOW.

63
00:03:47,127 --> 00:03:51,197
OH, NO, SAMMY.
I'VE BEEN A MOTHER
FOR 18 YEARS.

64
00:03:51,197 --> 00:03:54,348
WHEN SOMEONE SAYS,
"I DON'T KNOW"
LIKE THAT,
THEY KNOW.

65
00:03:54,348 --> 00:03:56,790
COUGH IT UP, OR I'M
GONNA GET IT OUT OF
YOU ANOTHER WAY.

66
00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:58,086
I DON'T KNOW.

67
00:03:58,086 --> 00:04:00,404
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT,
ALL RIGHT.

68
00:04:00,404 --> 00:04:02,414
HE'S AUDITIONING
FOR A PLAY.

69
00:04:02,414 --> 00:04:04,643
A PLAY?
YEAH.

70
00:04:04,643 --> 00:04:07,389
HICKEY McHICK
FROM HICKSVILLE
WANTS TO ACT?

71
00:04:07,389 --> 00:04:12,976
HE'S BEEN HANGING OUT
AT THIS LITTLE LOCAL PLAYHOUSE
DOING ALL
THE ODDS AND ENDS.

72
00:04:12,976 --> 00:04:17,231
SWEEPING,
CLEANING TOILETS--
EVERYTHING NO ONE ELSE
WANTS TO DO.

73
00:04:17,231 --> 00:04:20,153
I WONDER IF WOODY
WOULD LIKE TO ACT
OVER AT MY HOUSE.

74
00:04:24,332 --> 00:04:26,577
HERE HE COMES.
HE'S VERY SENSITIVE
ABOUT THIS.

75
00:04:26,577 --> 00:04:28,575
DON'T SAY ANYTHING
ABOUT HIS ACTING.

76
00:04:28,964 --> 00:04:31,172
- HEY, EVERYBODY.
- HEY, WOODY.

77
00:04:31,259 --> 00:04:34,944
IF I KNEW YOU WANTED
A ROLE, SO BADLY,
I WOULD HAVE STOPPED
AT THE BAKERY.

78
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:36,846
SAM.

79
00:04:38,878 --> 00:04:41,922
I'M SORRY.
HOW DID
THE AUDITION GO?

80
00:04:41,922 --> 00:04:45,925
GREAT. SAID MY LINES
FASTER THAN ANYONE ELSE.

81
00:04:47,021 --> 00:04:50,126
NOW, WOODMAN,
WHEN DID YOU GET BIT
BY THE OLD ACTING BUG?

82
00:04:50,126 --> 00:04:52,115
BACK IN HIGH SCHOOL
IN HANOVER.

83
00:04:52,115 --> 00:04:56,044
I WAS IN THE CHORUS
OF TH SENIOR CLASS
PRODUCTION OF HELLO, DONALD.

84
00:04:56,044 --> 00:04:58,373
ISN'T THAT
HELLO, DOLLY?

85
00:04:58,373 --> 00:05:03,165
OH, NO, NO,
THEY HAD TO
CHANGE THE NAME.
DONALD WEXLER WAS THE ONLY
GUY WHO COULD SING THE PART.

86
00:05:04,973 --> 00:05:07,459
SO WHAT'S THIS PLAY
YOU TRIED OUT FOR?

87
00:05:07,459 --> 00:05:10,693
WELL, IT'S
A BRAND-NEW ONE.
IT'S CALLED
AUTHORS IN HELL.

88
00:05:10,693 --> 00:05:15,715
I'M HOPING TO PLAY
EITHER MARK TWAIN,
ONE OF THE GUYS FROM
THE ALGONQUIN ROUND
TABLE,

89
00:05:15,715 --> 00:05:17,362
OR SATAN.

90
00:05:18,152 --> 00:05:21,367
BUT, HECK, I'D BE
JUST AS HAPPY PLAYING A
FIRE-BREATHING INCUBUS.

91
00:05:21,367 --> 00:05:24,470
THEY GET TO STAY
ON-STAGE THE WHOLE
FOUR HOURS.

92
00:05:26,928 --> 00:05:29,708
HEY, THAT'S MY DIRECTOR,
GRIF PALMER.

93
00:05:29,708 --> 00:05:33,635
- THIS MUST MEAN
I GOT THE PART.
- OR THAT
HE'S THIRSTY.

94
00:05:34,569 --> 00:05:39,021
- HI, MR. PALMER.
CAN I GET YOU A DRINK?
- NO, THANKS.

95
00:05:39,021 --> 00:05:41,264
I GOT THE PART!

96
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:45,535
WOODY, YOU'RE
A MULTITALENTED
YOUNG MAN.

97
00:05:45,535 --> 00:05:47,930
I DIDN'T GET
THE PART?

98
00:05:51,586 --> 00:05:55,319
YOU KNOW,
I'VE TRIED OUT
SO MANY TIMES
AND I'VE NEVER
GOTTEN A PART.

99
00:05:55,319 --> 00:05:57,578
MAYBE I'M JUST
WASTING MY TIME
IN THE THEATER.

100
00:05:57,578 --> 00:05:59,784
COME ON, WOODY,
DON'T GIVE UP
SO EASILY.

101
00:05:59,784 --> 00:06:03,461
ONCE UPON A TIME,
THERE WAS A YOUNG MAN
NAMED GRIF PALMER

102
00:06:03,461 --> 00:06:07,317
WHO ALSO AUDITIONED
FOR MANY A ROLE THAT
HE DIDN'T GET.

103
00:06:07,317 --> 00:06:11,195
- AS MANY AS ME?
- WELL, NO.

104
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:14,704
WAIT. WAIT. I'VE
GOT A THOUGHT.

105
00:06:14,704 --> 00:06:18,714
WHAT WOULD YOU SAY
IF I TOLD YOU
I'VE SELECTED
A FRESH NEW FACE

106
00:06:18,714 --> 00:06:20,770
TO UNDERSTUDY THE ROLE
OF MARK TWAIN?

107
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:24,938
I THINK YOU'LL BE HEARING
HIS NAME QUITE A BIT
FROM NOW ON,

108
00:06:24,938 --> 00:06:27,222
MR. WOODY BOYD.

109
00:06:27,222 --> 00:06:28,481
HEY, THAT'S ME!

110
00:06:28,481 --> 00:06:30,897
HEY, EVERYBODY,
I'M GOING TO BE
AN UNDERSTUDY!

111
00:06:30,897 --> 00:06:33,797
ALL RIGHT.
THAT'S GREAT.
THAT'S GOOD.

112
00:06:33,797 --> 00:06:36,683
WOODY, THIS ISN'T
GOING TO INTERFERE
WITH YOUR JOB, IS IT?

113
00:06:36,683 --> 00:06:38,559
GEE, I DON'T THINK SO.

114
00:06:38,559 --> 00:06:42,678
WELL...
YEAH.

115
00:06:42,678 --> 00:06:46,124
I'M SORRY, WOODY.
I NEED YOU HERE NIGHTS.

116
00:06:46,124 --> 00:06:50,110
MISS HOWE, THIS IS
MY GOLDEN CHANCE.
I HAVE TO DO THIS.

117
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:54,781
DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND?
I JUST GOT TO DO IT!
I JUST GOT TO!

118
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,133
THAT WAS
REALLY GOOD, MAN.

119
00:07:00,133 --> 00:07:02,349
CAN I TALK TO YOU
JUST FOR A SECOND
HERE?

120
00:07:03,191 --> 00:07:06,837
LET HIM DO IT.
- I WOULD LOVE TO,
BUT I NEED HIM HERE.

121
00:07:06,837 --> 00:07:09,274
HE'LL BE HERE.
YOU SAW THAT
PERFORMANCE.

122
00:07:09,274 --> 00:07:11,628
THEY'RE NOT
GONNA LET HIM
GO ON.

123
00:07:13,201 --> 00:07:16,605
- BREAK A LEG, WOODY.
- ALL RIGHT!

124
00:07:16,605 --> 00:07:20,639
WELCOME TO THE
THEATER, WOODY--
TO THE RANKS OF
THE LUNTS AND THE OLIVIERS.

125
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:24,892
TO A PROFESSION
RIPE WITH STYLE,
WITH HISTORY, WITH DIGNITY.

126
00:07:24,892 --> 00:07:28,869
TO A CALLING
I ONLY HOPE WILL
BRING YOU AS MUCH JOY

127
00:07:28,869 --> 00:07:31,219
AS IT HAS BROUGHT ME.

128
00:07:32,576 --> 00:07:34,806
- HI.
- HELLO.

129
00:07:35,023 --> 00:07:39,956
- YOU KNOW GRIF PALMER?
- YEAH. HE'S THE JANITOR
AT MY KIDS' SCHOOL.

130
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:51,553
"HELLO, GOOD-MANNERED
AND AGREEABLE CHILDREN."

131
00:07:52,473 --> 00:07:55,313
HEY, EVERYBODY.
LOOK WHO'S HERE.

132
00:07:55,313 --> 00:07:59,389
IT'S THAT FAMOUS
ACTOR ROBERT DeZERO.

133
00:08:00,848 --> 00:08:03,437
NO, CARLA.
IT'S ME--WOODY.

134
00:08:03,437 --> 00:08:08,964
WOODY,
YOU HAVE BEEN
COMING IN HERE
DRESSED IN THAT
RIDICULOUS GET-UP
FOR THREE WEEKS NOW.

135
00:08:08,964 --> 00:08:10,994
WHEN ARE YOU
GOING TO STOP
THIS NONSENSE?

136
00:08:10,994 --> 00:08:16,067
CARLA, AS AN UNDERSTUDY,
I HAVE TO BE DRESSED
AND READY TO GO ON
AT A MOMENT'S NOTICE.

137
00:08:16,067 --> 00:08:20,847
PUTTING ON MAKE-UP
LIKE THIS CAN TAKE HOURS,
BUT I WOULDN'T
EXPECT YOU TO UNDERSTAND.

138
00:08:20,847 --> 00:08:23,196
WHY, BECAUSE I'M NOT
IN THE THE-A-TAH?

139
00:08:23,196 --> 00:08:25,979
NO, BECAUSE YOU
DON'T WEAR MAKE-UP.

140
00:08:27,942 --> 00:08:29,284
HUCKLEBERRY ALERT.

141
00:08:29,366 --> 00:08:31,833
HEY, MARK TWIT!

142
00:08:33,128 --> 00:08:35,654
WOODY, WOULD YOU RUN
UPSTAIRS AND GET SOME CHANGE?

143
00:08:35,654 --> 00:08:38,533
ONES AND FIVES.
NEW BILLS IF THEY'VE GOT THEM.

144
00:08:38,533 --> 00:08:41,633
"AH. LET US NOT
BE TOO PARTICULAR.

145
00:08:41,633 --> 00:08:45,693
"IT IS BETTER TO HAVE
OLD SECONDHAND DIAMONDS
THAN NONE AT ALL."

146
00:08:45,693 --> 00:08:48,048
DO YOU THINK YOU COULD
MANAGE IT
WITHOUT ANY QUOTES?

147
00:08:48,048 --> 00:08:51,497
"I COULD DO IT AS EASY
AS FALLING OFF A LOG."

148
00:08:51,497 --> 00:08:53,579
WOODY, JUST DO IT!

149
00:08:53,579 --> 00:08:57,070
"WHEN ANGRY, COUNT FOUR.
WHEN VERY ANGRY, SWEAR."

150
00:08:57,070 --> 00:09:00,057
DAMN IT!
THERE YOU GO.

151
00:09:02,243 --> 00:09:04,053
SAM, RUN UPSTAIRS
AND GET ME SOME CHANGE.

152
00:09:04,053 --> 00:09:06,747
AW, COME ON.
THAT'S A JUNIOR
BARTENDER'S JOB.

153
00:09:06,747 --> 00:09:10,486
YOU ARE
THE JUNIOR BARTENDER.
OH, RIGHT.

154
00:09:10,851 --> 00:09:13,251
YEAH, BUT I'M WORKING
MY WAY UP, YOU KNOW.

155
00:09:13,251 --> 00:09:16,924
PRETTY SOON I MIGHT
EVEN OWN MY OWN BAR.

156
00:09:20,861 --> 00:09:24,067
- GOOD EVENING,
MA'AM.
- OH, HELLO, THERE.

157
00:09:25,633 --> 00:09:30,212
OH, THANK YOU.
I'M BLIND AS A BAT
WITHOUT GLASSES.

158
00:09:30,212 --> 00:09:32,862
I'VE NEVER SEEN
A BAT WITH GLASSES.

159
00:09:35,509 --> 00:09:39,537
- THAT'S FUNNY.
- YEAH. I CAN IMAGINE.

160
00:09:43,151 --> 00:09:45,653
I BELIEVE
IT MIGHT RAIN SOON.

161
00:09:45,653 --> 00:09:48,592
"ONE OF
THE BRIGHTEST GEMS
"OF THE NEW ENGLAND
WEATHER

162
00:09:48,592 --> 00:09:50,491
IS THE DAZZLING
UNCERTAINTY OF IT."

163
00:09:50,491 --> 00:09:52,326
WELL, WHAT CAN YOU DO?

164
00:09:52,326 --> 00:09:57,061
"EVERYBODY TALKS
ABOUT THE WEATHER,
BUT NO ONE EVER DOES
ANYTHING ABOUT IT."

165
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:02,134
MAY I HAVE A GLASS
OF WHITE WINE, PLEASE?

166
00:10:02,134 --> 00:10:06,219
WINE...WHITE WINE.
UH...LET'S SEE, NOW.

167
00:10:06,219 --> 00:10:08,789
THEY HAVE A LOT OF WINE
IN SAN FRANCISCO,
DON'T THEY?

168
00:10:08,789 --> 00:10:10,084
OH, I SUPPOSE THEY DO.

169
00:10:10,084 --> 00:10:12,569
"ONE OF THE COLDEST
WINTERS I EVER SPENT

170
00:10:12,569 --> 00:10:15,327
WAS SUMMER
IN SAN FRANCISCO."

171
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:18,204
SORRY. THAT'S CLOSE
AS I COULD GET.

172
00:10:18,204 --> 00:10:20,921
HA HA HA!
YOU'RE RATHER AMUSING.

173
00:10:20,921 --> 00:10:23,537
THANKS, BUT I'VE BEEN
QUOTING MARK TWAIN.

174
00:10:23,537 --> 00:10:26,665
I KNOW. I THINK
THAT'S AMUSING.

175
00:10:27,761 --> 00:10:31,882
AND I SUPPOSE THAT
YOU'VE BEEN TOLD
THAT YOU LOOK
SOMETHING LIKE HIM.

176
00:10:31,882 --> 00:10:34,397
YEAH. I GET THAT A LOT.

177
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:39,973
YOU LOOK A LITTLE BIT
LIKE EMILY DICKINSON.
SHE'S ONE OF THE AUTHORS
IN HELL.

178
00:10:40,076 --> 00:10:43,010
OH, THAT'S AN UNKIND
ASSUMPTION, SIR.

179
00:10:45,479 --> 00:10:49,483
ALTHOUGH SHE'S NEVER BEEN
ONE OF MY FAVORITES, EITHER.

180
00:10:49,884 --> 00:10:51,552
HERE'S YOUR CHANGE,

181
00:10:51,552 --> 00:10:53,550
AND, OH, YEAH, A LITTLE
SOMETHING FOR YOU HERE.

182
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:57,187
WHAT IS IT?
ONE OF THE SHRIMPS FROM
UP AT THE BUFFET TABLE.

183
00:10:59,093 --> 00:11:01,879
YOU'RE LUCKY.
MY FIRST CHOICE
WAS AN OYSTER.

184
00:11:01,879 --> 00:11:04,832
SO WAS MINE,
BUT I HIRED YOU.

185
00:11:06,434 --> 00:11:08,457
I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU
IN HERE BEFORE, HAVE I?

186
00:11:08,457 --> 00:11:13,083
NO. I DON'T
GET AROUND MUCH
SINCE MY HUSBAND
LLOYD PASSED AWAY.

187
00:11:13,083 --> 00:11:15,949
WE USED TO COME
BY HERE EVERY EVENING
DURING OUR WALK,

188
00:11:15,949 --> 00:11:18,148
BUT LLOYD NEVER
LET US COME IN.

189
00:11:18,148 --> 00:11:20,698
HE GOT JEALOUS
WHEN I WAS AROUND OTHER MEN.

190
00:11:20,698 --> 00:11:22,433
I CAN SEE WHY.

191
00:11:22,433 --> 00:11:25,750
OH, FOR HEAVEN'S SAKES.

192
00:11:26,387 --> 00:11:30,568
I THINK YOU'RE BLUSHING.
OH, IT'S THE WINE.

193
00:11:32,293 --> 00:11:34,728
ALTHOUGH,
AS MARK TWAIN SAID,

194
00:11:34,728 --> 00:11:38,193
"MAN IS THE ONLY
ANIMAL THAT BLUSHES..."

195
00:11:38,193 --> 00:11:40,449
OR NEEDS TO."

196
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:45,723
ALL ABOARD
THE S.S. DELMONICO,

197
00:11:45,723 --> 00:11:48,299
EMBARKING AT 0900 HOURS FOR NASSAU,

198
00:11:48,299 --> 00:11:51,913
SAINT THOMAS,
MARTINIQUE,
AND OTHER EXOTIC
PORTS OF CALL.

199
00:11:55,683 --> 00:11:57,383
SO YOU TOOK
MY ADVICE, HUH?

200
00:11:57,383 --> 00:12:00,773
YES. AS OF CLOSE
OF BUSINESS TODAY,
IT'S JUST US,

201
00:12:00,773 --> 00:12:03,397
A COUPLE OF FUN-LOVING
SWABBIES LOST AT SEA.

202
00:12:03,397 --> 00:12:05,065
WE'LL BE TOTO
INCOMMUNICADO.

203
00:12:05,065 --> 00:12:08,901
NO BUSINESS, NO CLIENTS,
NO PHONE CALLS...

204
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:11,899
LILITH, WE PROMISED
NO BEEPERS.

205
00:12:11,899 --> 00:12:14,568
I WON'T GIVE IT UP
WITHOUT A FIGHT.

206
00:12:14,568 --> 00:12:16,854
YOU'LL HAVE TO
PERFORM A STRIP SEARCH.

207
00:12:16,854 --> 00:12:19,677
THE VACATION HAS BEGUN!

208
00:12:19,677 --> 00:12:24,419
NOW HEAR THIS!
HEAR THIS, STERN.
PREPARE TO BE BOARDED!

209
00:12:34,022 --> 00:12:38,726
FOLKS, I HAVE A BIT OF
BAD NEWS THAT MAY
AFFECT A LOT OF YOU.

210
00:12:38,726 --> 00:12:42,714
I'M NOT GONNA BEAT
AROUND THE BUSH.
I'M JUST GONNA
COME RIGHT OUT AND SAY IT.

211
00:12:42,714 --> 00:12:44,924
LAST CALL.

212
00:12:48,202 --> 00:12:50,459
WELL, WHAT THE HECK?

213
00:12:50,459 --> 00:12:54,658
MAYBE
I'LL GIVE VERA A THRILL
AND GO HOME
A LITTLE EARLY TONIGHT.

214
00:12:55,443 --> 00:12:59,292
ALTHOUGH, YOU KNOW,
SHE DID LOOK KIND
OF THRILLED WHEN I LEFT.

215
00:13:01,215 --> 00:13:02,978
EXCUSE ME, MARY.

216
00:13:02,978 --> 00:13:06,187
LISTEN.
I'LL BE BACK
IN A SECOND.
AND THEN I'LL
SEE YOU HOME.

217
00:13:06,187 --> 00:13:09,723
OH, THAT'S ALL RIGHT,
BUT THANK YOU.

218
00:13:09,723 --> 00:13:12,160
I'VE HAD A
WONDERFUL EVENING.

219
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:15,120
WELL, I HAVE, TOO.
I'VE REALLY ENJOYED
YOUR COMPANY.

220
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,366
- YOU'RE A VERY NICE LADY.
- AND YOU'RE
A LOVELY GENTLEMAN.

221
00:13:18,366 --> 00:13:24,605
AND MAY I ADD,
YOU HAVE THE MOST GLORIOUS
HEAD OF HAIR
I'VE SEEN ON ANY MAN
SINCE MY LLOYD DIED.

222
00:13:24,605 --> 00:13:27,171
GEE, I HATE TO
DISAPPOINT YOU,
BUT THIS
IS A WIG.

223
00:13:27,171 --> 00:13:30,039
YES. SO WAS LLOYD'S.

224
00:13:33,381 --> 00:13:38,585
UH, PARDON ME, MA'AM,
BUT THAT ADORABLE
BARTENDER OVER THERE...

225
00:13:38,585 --> 00:13:40,117
- WOODY?
- YES.

226
00:13:40,117 --> 00:13:43,778
IS HE KEEPING COMPANY
WITH ANYONE
IN PARTICULAR?

227
00:13:43,778 --> 00:13:45,286
NOT THAT I KNOW OF.

228
00:13:45,286 --> 00:13:47,428
WELL, I THINK
HE'S VERY SPECIAL.

229
00:13:47,428 --> 00:13:51,055
WELL, I GUESS
THAT'S THE NICEST
WAY OF PUTTING IT.

230
00:13:51,977 --> 00:13:54,635
- GOOD NIGHT.
- GOOD NIGHT.

231
00:13:58,271 --> 00:14:01,225
OH, WOODS.

232
00:14:01,225 --> 00:14:05,435
YOU KNOW THAT
DUST IN A DRESS
YOU'VE BEEN
YAKKING WITH?

233
00:14:07,881 --> 00:14:11,973
MARY?
YOU DIDN'T,
BY ANY CHANCE,
HAPPEN TO TELL HER

234
00:14:11,973 --> 00:14:15,072
THAT YOU'RE WEARING
OLD MAN MAKE-UP FOR A PLAY,
DID YOU?

235
00:14:15,072 --> 00:14:19,201
THAT SORT OF THING IS
PRETTY HARD TO WORK INTO
POLITE CONVERSATION.

236
00:14:19,727 --> 00:14:24,390
WITH YOUR MAKEUP AND
THE LIGHTING IN HERE
AND THOSE MR. MAGOO
GLASSES OF HERS,

237
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:26,317
I THINK SHE GOT
THE WRONG IDEA.

238
00:14:26,317 --> 00:14:29,002
SHE'S GOT
THE HOTS FOR YOU.

239
00:14:29,002 --> 00:14:30,871
CARLA, YOU'RE CRAZY.

240
00:14:30,871 --> 00:14:34,085
SHE'S JUST A SAD, OLD
WOMAN WHO NEEDED SOMEONE
TO TALK TO.

241
00:14:34,085 --> 00:14:37,024
YOU OF ALL PEOPLE
SHOULD UNDERSTAND THAT.

242
00:14:41,515 --> 00:14:45,595
THERE'S NO WAY
SHE'S GONNA GO FOR ME,
I MEAN, IN ORDER FOR HER
TO FALL IN LOVE WITH ME,

243
00:14:45,595 --> 00:14:48,810
I'D HAVE TO BE
THE BEST DARN ACTOR
IN BOSTON.

244
00:14:55,429 --> 00:15:00,631
OH, NO!
I'M THE BEST DARN
ACTOR IN BOSTON.

245
00:15:11,822 --> 00:15:14,097
HELLO, MON.

246
00:15:15,649 --> 00:15:18,057
I'M SORRY.
LIMBO NIGHT'S TUESDAY,
MAN.

247
00:15:18,057 --> 00:15:19,819
HEY, MAN, YOU STOP
WITH DE BAD MOUTH STYLIN',

248
00:15:19,819 --> 00:15:23,013
OR I'M GONNA HAVE TO
BOP YOU ON DE HEAD
WIT DE BANANA BOAT, MON.

249
00:15:23,891 --> 00:15:25,886
FRASIER. FRASIER, PLEASE
CUT THE CALYPSO.

250
00:15:25,886 --> 00:15:29,863
ISN'T IT ENOUGH
THE CAB DRIVER ALREADY
TOOK A SWING AT YOU?

251
00:15:29,863 --> 00:15:31,805
YOU GUYS LOOK LIKE
YOU HAD
A GOOD TIME.

252
00:15:31,805 --> 00:15:33,177
WE HAD OODLES OF FUN,

253
00:15:33,177 --> 00:15:36,170
AND WE LOST A COMBINED
11 POUNDS, TO BOOT.

254
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:39,708
YOU LOST WEIGHT
ON A CRUISE?
I HEARD THERE ARE
WALL-TO-WALL MEALS.

255
00:15:39,708 --> 00:15:42,576
THERE ARE ALSO
WALL-TO-WALL WAVES.

256
00:15:43,844 --> 00:15:48,549
WELL, FORTUNATELY,
AFTER THREE DAYS
OF GIVING CHEF HUGO'S
FINE CUISINE
BACK TO THE SEA,

257
00:15:48,549 --> 00:15:51,952
WE WERE FITTED WITH
THESE LITTLE EAR PATCHES.
THEY SEEMED TO DO THE TRICK.

258
00:15:51,952 --> 00:15:55,168
AND PUT US TO SLEEP FOR
THE REST OF THE TRIP.

259
00:15:55,523 --> 00:15:58,719
SO YOU GUYS SPENT SEVEN DAYS
AND NIGHTS

260
00:15:58,719 --> 00:16:02,053
SNOOZING AND BARFING
YOUR WAY THROUGH THE CARIBBEAN?

261
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:06,033
AND WE'VE NEVER
FELT SLIMMER AND
MORE REFRESHED.

262
00:16:06,033 --> 00:16:09,620
WELL, WHAT SAY WE GO
AND GET SOME LUNCH, THERE,
MY LITTLE MARINE MELON?

263
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:10,922
ANYTHING YOU WANT.

264
00:16:10,922 --> 00:16:14,994
JUST PROMISE ME
YOU WON'T REFER
TO THE WAITRESS
AS "SEESTAH."

265
00:16:15,443 --> 00:16:18,098
* DAY-O, DAY-O *

266
00:16:18,098 --> 00:16:20,207
* DAYLIGHT COME
AND ME WAN GO HOME **

267
00:16:20,207 --> 00:16:22,448
YOU'RE NOT
THE ONLY ONE.

268
00:16:25,253 --> 00:16:28,238
OH! HEY, WOODY,
I THOUGHT
YOUR PLAY CLOSED.

269
00:16:28,238 --> 00:16:29,888
IT DID, LAST NIGHT.

270
00:16:29,888 --> 00:16:32,700
SO WHAT'S WITH
THE OLD GEEZER DRAG?

271
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:35,235
I WAS WITH MARY.
ANOTHER DATE, HUH?

272
00:16:35,235 --> 00:16:40,384
IT WASN'T A DATE.
I JUST TOOK HER TO LUNCH,
THEN A MOVIE,
AND THEN DANCING.

273
00:16:41,569 --> 00:16:44,346
HEY, WOODY,
WOODY, WOODY, WOODY.
MAN, THIS IS CRAZY.

274
00:16:44,346 --> 00:16:46,867
YOU'VE BEEN OUT WITH MARY
EVERY NIGHT THIS WEEK.

275
00:16:46,867 --> 00:16:49,943
YOU CAN'T SPEND YOUR LIFE
DRESSED UP LIKE MARK TWAIN.

276
00:16:49,943 --> 00:16:51,882
WHY NOT? HE DID.

277
00:16:53,313 --> 00:16:56,920
OH, SAM, I--I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO DO.

278
00:16:56,920 --> 00:17:01,458
I'VE TRIED TO TELL HER,
BUT EVERY TIME I DO,
SHE JUST STARES AT ME
WITH THOSE BIG, LONELY
EYES.

279
00:17:01,458 --> 00:17:04,598
I MEAN,
WHO'D HAVE THOUGHT
THAT MY GOD-GIVEN
ACTING TALENT

280
00:17:04,598 --> 00:17:06,329
WAS GONNA TURN OUT
TO BE A CURSE?

281
00:17:06,329 --> 00:17:08,397
ARE WE VOTING?

282
00:17:09,897 --> 00:17:11,932
YOU GOT TO
NIP THIS IN THE BUD.

283
00:17:11,932 --> 00:17:13,705
I AGREE THERE, WOODY.

284
00:17:13,705 --> 00:17:18,289
FOR A YOUNG MAN
SUCH AS YOURSELF
TO BE SPENDING SO MUCH TIME
WITH AN OLDER WOMAN IS--

285
00:17:18,289 --> 00:17:19,973
EH, IT'S JUST UNNATURAL.

286
00:17:19,973 --> 00:17:21,566
YEAH, WELL,
HOW ABOUT YOU,
CLIFF?

287
00:17:21,566 --> 00:17:24,623
YOU SPEND
LOTS OF TIME
WITH YOUR MOTHER,
AND SHE'S OLD.

288
00:17:24,623 --> 00:17:29,849
MY MA'S NOT OLD,
AND SHE'S NEVER GONNA
DIE BEFORE I DO,
SO JUST SHUT UP, OK?

289
00:17:34,488 --> 00:17:37,829
HEY. HEY.
HEY, WOODS.
MARY JUST CAME IN.

290
00:17:37,829 --> 00:17:39,643
MAYBE YOU SHOULD
GET HER A GLASS
OF SOMETHING.

291
00:17:39,643 --> 00:17:41,398
SHE DOESN'T DRINK
IN THE AFTERNOON.

292
00:17:41,398 --> 00:17:43,711
NO, I MEAN
TO PUT HER TEETH IN.

293
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,872
HI, MARY.
HI.

294
00:17:48,872 --> 00:17:51,859
- WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?
- I JUST WANTED
TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

295
00:17:51,859 --> 00:17:57,361
YEAH.
CAN WE SIT DOWN?
I'D LIKE TO TALK
WITH YOU A SECOND.
- ALL RIGHT.

296
00:17:59,317 --> 00:18:03,716
LISTEN. I KNOW HOW LONELY
YOU'VE BEEN
SINCE LLOYD PASSED AWAY.

297
00:18:03,716 --> 00:18:07,908
OH, HOW LONELY
I WAS.
I'M NOT ANYMORE.

298
00:18:10,758 --> 00:18:16,229
YOU KNOW, "LONELINESS
IS HIGHLY UNDERRATED.

299
00:18:16,229 --> 00:18:19,521
"IT'S ONE
OF THE FEW THINGS LEFT
THAT YOU CAN
STILL DO ALONE."

300
00:18:19,521 --> 00:18:21,552
DID MARK TWAIN
SAY THAT?

301
00:18:21,552 --> 00:18:24,941
WELL, NO, BUT I'M
KIND OF RUNNING OUT
OF HIS MATERIAL.

302
00:18:25,573 --> 00:18:28,430
THERE'S SOMETHING
I WANT TO GIVE YOU.

303
00:18:28,642 --> 00:18:32,963
IT'S LLOYD'S WATCH.
I WANT YOU
TO HAVE IT.

304
00:18:32,963 --> 00:18:36,462
- NO, I COULDN'T.
- OH, PLEASE.

305
00:18:36,637 --> 00:18:39,731
UH, GEE, THANKS, MARY.

306
00:18:40,053 --> 00:18:43,296
- WOULD YOU EXCUSE ME
FOR A SECOND?
- SURE.

307
00:18:43,591 --> 00:18:45,749
OH, WAIT.

308
00:18:45,749 --> 00:18:50,086
I JUST WANT TO MEMORIZE
THE WAY YOU LOOK
IN THIS LIGHT.

309
00:18:51,098 --> 00:18:53,411
GO AHEAD.

310
00:18:58,506 --> 00:19:00,231
SAM, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO DO.

311
00:19:00,231 --> 00:19:03,127
NOW SHE'S MEMORIZING
THE WAY I LOOK
IN DIFFERENT KINDS
OF LIGHT.

312
00:19:03,127 --> 00:19:05,636
AW, NO, WOODY,
WOMEN DO THAT
ALL THE TIME.

313
00:19:05,636 --> 00:19:08,837
AND SHE GAVE ME
HER DEAD HUSBAND'S WATCH.

314
00:19:11,284 --> 00:19:13,465
YOU COULD DO
A LOT WORSE.

315
00:19:15,956 --> 00:19:19,532
LISTEN. YOU GOT
TO END THIS RIGHT NOW.
GO ON.

316
00:19:19,532 --> 00:19:23,592
I DON'T KNOW HOW.
YOU KNOW, I CAN'T STAND
THE THOUGHT
OF HURTING
SOMEBODY'S FEELINGS.

317
00:19:23,592 --> 00:19:24,432
I KNOW.

318
00:19:24,432 --> 00:19:28,120
CARLA, YOU'VE BEEN DUMPED
A MILLION TIMES.
WHAT'S THE BEST WAY
TO DO IT?

319
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:33,087
YOU KNOW, THE ONLY REASON I'M
NOT CLEANING YOUR CLOCK

320
00:19:33,087 --> 00:19:36,328
IS BECAUSE YOU REMIND ME
OF JED CLAMPETT.

321
00:19:37,611 --> 00:19:40,900
LISTEN, YOU ARE NOT
DUMPING HER.
YOU'RE LEVELING WITH HER.

322
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:42,587
NOW, IT'S THE ONLY
HONEST THING TO DO.

323
00:19:42,587 --> 00:19:45,248
NOW, GO ON.
BE A MAN. DO IT.

324
00:19:45,853 --> 00:19:47,835
YOU'RE RIGHT, SAM.

325
00:19:47,835 --> 00:19:52,251
IT'S TIME I STOOD
ON MY OWN TWO FEET
AND DID
WHAT'S RIGHT.
RIGHT.

326
00:19:52,392 --> 00:19:54,477
WILL YOU
COME WITH ME?

327
00:19:54,695 --> 00:19:57,759
- THIS IS SOMETHING
YOU'VE GOT TO DO BY YOURSELF.
- I CAN'T.

328
00:19:57,759 --> 00:20:02,733
- I'M NOT
GOING TO DO IT, WOODY.
- PLEASE, SAM. I CAN'T
DO THIS BY MYSELF.

329
00:20:02,733 --> 00:20:06,021
- ALL RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT. I'M SORRY.
- THANK YOU.

330
00:20:06,021 --> 00:20:08,995
YOU BELIEVE
I'M JUST AN UNDERSTUDY?

331
00:20:12,746 --> 00:20:15,388
UH, MARY?
YES?

332
00:20:15,388 --> 00:20:18,201
WOODY WANTS TO
TELL YOU SOMETHING.

333
00:20:19,853 --> 00:20:23,791
WELL, UH,
MARY, YOU SEE...

334
00:20:25,092 --> 00:20:28,061
UH, I MEAN,
YOU KNOW, UH, HOW...

335
00:20:28,061 --> 00:20:32,199
I DON'T SUPPOSE
THERE'S ANY CHANCE
YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT
I'M TALKING ABOUT YET.

336
00:20:32,199 --> 00:20:34,735
ACTUALLY, I DO.

337
00:20:34,735 --> 00:20:37,550
LET ME EXPLAIN SOMETHING
TO YOU, WOODY.

338
00:20:38,939 --> 00:20:43,293
I'M A VERY LONELY WOMAN
SINCE I LOST MY HUSBAND.

339
00:20:43,293 --> 00:20:46,470
MY FAMILY LIVES
OUT OF STATE,
I NEVER SEE
MY GRANDCHILDREN,

340
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:50,851
AND MOST OF MY FRIENDS
HAVE MOVED
OR PASSED AWAY.

341
00:20:50,851 --> 00:20:53,687
SEEMS MY DAYS ARE
SO HARD TO FILL.

342
00:20:53,687 --> 00:20:58,527
I SWEAR, THERE WERE
MORNINGS WHEN IT
DIDN'T SEEM WORTHWHILE
GETTING OUT OF BED.

343
00:20:58,527 --> 00:20:59,727
AND THEN I MET YOU--

344
00:20:59,727 --> 00:21:03,559
STOP. STOP.
WILL YOU MARRY ME?

345
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:12,314
HEAVENS, NO!
I'M THREE TIMES
YOUR AGE.

346
00:21:12,314 --> 00:21:17,249
- YOU KNOW
THAT I'M YOUNG?
- WOODY, I MAY BE OLD,
BUT I'M NOT STUPID.

347
00:21:19,546 --> 00:21:24,415
- WELL, WHY DIDN'T YOU
EVER TELL ME THIS?
- WELL, I ENJOYED
YOUR COMPANY SO.

348
00:21:24,415 --> 00:21:26,179
BESIDES, EVERY TIME
I WANTED TO,

349
00:21:26,179 --> 00:21:30,908
YOU STARTED QUOTING
THE JUMPING FROG
OF CALAVERAS COUNTY.

350
00:21:30,908 --> 00:21:33,607
I HOPE YOU'RE NOT
UPSET WITH ME.

351
00:21:33,607 --> 00:21:37,526
OH, ARE YOU KIDDING?
I'M JUST GLAD I DIDN'T
HAVE TO DUMP YOU.

352
00:21:37,526 --> 00:21:41,904
AND BESIDES,
YOU HAD SUCH FUN
PLAYING THE PART,
AND YOU WERE
QUITE EXCELLENT.

353
00:21:41,904 --> 00:21:45,352
- YOU SURE YOU DON'T
WANT TO MARRY ME?
- NO, WOODY.

354
00:21:45,352 --> 00:21:50,060
WILL YOU BE
MY GRANDMA?
- WELL, MAYBE
A FAVORITE AUNT.

355
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:52,305
ALL RIGHT.
IT'S A DEAL.

356
00:21:52,305 --> 00:21:55,582
MY BIRTHDAY'S
JULY 23.

357
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:59,338
I JUST GAVE YOU
THE WATCH.

358
00:22:00,788 --> 00:22:02,723
BY THE WAY,

359
00:22:02,723 --> 00:22:06,402
WE'RE STILL ON
FOR POT ROAST
ON SATURDAY.

360
00:22:06,794 --> 00:22:09,057
LEAVE THE WIG AT HOME.

361
00:22:10,864 --> 00:22:13,928
BYE-BYE.
BYE.

362
00:22:15,769 --> 00:22:20,364
WELL, I GUESS
IN A REALLY
WEIRD WAY,
IT KIND OF
WORKED OUT,
DIDN'T IT?

363
00:22:20,842 --> 00:22:24,678
- YEAH. I'M STILL
A LITTLE DEPRESSED.
- WHY?

364
00:22:24,678 --> 00:22:27,636
WELL, MARY KNOWS
I'M A GOOD ACTOR,

365
00:22:27,636 --> 00:22:30,488
BUT NOW THAT AUTHORS
IN HELL IS CLOSED,

366
00:22:30,488 --> 00:22:33,286
I'M NOT GONNA GET TO SHOW
THE REST OF THE WORLD.

367
00:22:33,286 --> 00:22:35,535
OH, YEAH.

368
00:22:36,123 --> 00:22:39,284
WELL, I GOT AN IDEA.
WHY DON'T YOU
DO IT RIGHT HERE?

369
00:22:39,284 --> 00:22:42,108
HOP RIGHT UP THERE
AND SHOW THE WHOLE BAR.

370
00:22:42,108 --> 00:22:44,653
AW, I DON'T KNOW.

371
00:22:46,086 --> 00:22:48,596
ALL RIGHT!

372
00:22:49,569 --> 00:22:52,773
GATHER ROUND, EVERYBODY.
I'M GOING TO DO
AUTHORS IN HELL.

373
00:22:52,773 --> 00:22:54,792
I MEAN,
IF THAT'S ALL RIGHT
WITH YOU, MISS HOWE.

374
00:22:54,792 --> 00:22:58,305
WELL, I WAS PLANNING
TO WAIT FOR THE MOVIE,
BUT GO AHEAD.

375
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:04,636
IMAGINE, IF YOU WILL,
A HUGE BOOK OPENS UP,

376
00:23:04,636 --> 00:23:08,305
AND I, MARK TWAIN,
STEP OUT.

377
00:23:08,305 --> 00:23:14,153
I AM SURROUNDED BY VARIOUS
TORMENTED AMERICAN WRITERS
AND SATAN.

378
00:23:15,095 --> 00:23:17,331
THE LIGHTS DIM.

379
00:23:24,504 --> 00:23:29,658
"PERSONS ATTEMPTING TO FIND
A MOTIVE IN THIS NARRATIVE

380
00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:31,944
"WILL BE PROSECUTED.

381

385
00:24:02,843 --> 00:24:05,044
WOODY, GO ON.

386
00:24:05,693 --> 00:24:10,833
I JUST SIT HERE
AND SMOKE.
I DON'T TALK AGAIN
UNTIL THE MIDDLE
OF ACT FOUR.
