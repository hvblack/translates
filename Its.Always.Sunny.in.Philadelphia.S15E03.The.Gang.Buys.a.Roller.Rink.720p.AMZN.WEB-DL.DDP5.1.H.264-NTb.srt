1
00:00:09,255 --> 00:00:11,157
Are you kidding me?
I love Joni Mitchell.

2
00:00:11,157 --> 00:00:12,851
It's Janis Joplin I don't like.

3
00:00:12,919 --> 00:00:16,127
- Why?
- I don't like her voice.
Her voice drives me insane.

4
00:00:16,127 --> 00:00:17,014
- You're out of your mind.
- No, she's out of her mind.

5
00:00:17,014 --> 00:00:19,425
What do you think
about this, then?

6
00:00:21,628 --> 00:00:23,772
I do like that. I love that.

7
00:00:23,772 --> 00:00:28,125
Look at those moves.
- You got the moves, Charlie.

8
00:00:29,125 --> 00:00:31,354
Hey, I like this a lot.
Why are we doing it?

9
00:00:31,354 --> 00:00:34,268
Oh, South Philly Skate's
closing, man.

10
00:00:34,268 --> 00:00:36,794
- What?
- What?
Huh?
- Yeah.

11
00:00:36,794 --> 00:00:40,391
Why would you deliver
such sad news
in such an upbeat fashion?

12
00:00:40,391 --> 00:00:44,405
Uh, yeah, you know what?
It felt wrong as I was doing it.
Wasn't sure how to stop.

13
00:00:44,405 --> 00:00:45,930
I can't believe this.

14
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:50,135
Everybody wants to pave paradise
and put up a parking lot.

15
00:00:50,135 --> 00:00:51,991
- Nice! Nice.
Uh, Joni Mitchell,
yeah.

16
00:00:51,991 --> 00:00:54,267
- I found a way to weave it in.
- I heard you do that.

17
00:00:54,267 --> 00:00:58,944
Now, guys, look,
the real question is
what are we gonna do
about the rink?

18
00:00:59,344 --> 00:01:02,344
GANG

19
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:23,382
Wait a minute. Wait. You guys
want to buy a roller rink?

20
00:01:23,382 --> 00:01:25,814
Oh, God, no. No, no, no.
We-we already tried that.

21
00:01:25,814 --> 00:01:28,196
- Yeah. You guys remember that?
The last time we were there.

22
00:01:28,196 --> 00:01:29,718
- That's right.
The last time we were there.

23
00:01:29,718 --> 00:01:33,406
What-what year was that?
- 1998.

24
00:01:33,406 --> 00:01:36,297
- You guys remember that night?
- Oh, yeah.

25
00:01:36,297 --> 00:01:38,546
Like it was yesterday.

26
00:01:50,434 --> 00:01:52,928
- Hey, no whipping.
I saw that.

27
00:01:52,928 --> 00:01:55,214
Are you chewing gum?
No gum on my rink, all right?

28
00:01:55,214 --> 00:01:57,636
Go spit it out.
Gum is the enemy.

29
00:02:03,516 --> 00:02:07,500
Skate clean, everybody.
Let's skate clean.
That is the main thing.

30
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,708
Richie Keen, keep it clean,
buddy, all right?

31
00:02:09,708 --> 00:02:11,318
I don't want to see
any hotdogging.

32
00:02:11,318 --> 00:02:13,709
Hotdogging happens
at the concession stand.

33
00:02:13,709 --> 00:02:17,596
Okay, new people.
Coming through, coming through.

34
00:02:17,596 --> 00:02:20,493
All right, come on, let's go.
Keep it clean.

35
00:02:20,493 --> 00:02:22,264
- Watch it.

36
00:02:22,868 --> 00:02:25,529
Briana, no more gum.

37
00:02:25,989 --> 00:02:27,717
Man, can't trust anybody.

38
00:02:27,717 --> 00:02:29,425
Yo, Mac.

39
00:02:29,425 --> 00:02:32,295
- Yo, what's up, Charlie?
It's buzzing out there, huh?

40
00:02:32,295 --> 00:02:35,716
Yeah, dude, the roller rink
business is booming, man.
Let me tell you.

41
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:39,554
Now take that jacket off, dude.
How many times
do I have to tell you
you can't wear
street clothes at work.

42
00:02:39,554 --> 00:02:42,448
What you talking about, man?
This jacket's phat as hell.

43
00:02:42,448 --> 00:02:44,802
It may be phat, but you're not
supposed to wear it, all right?

44
00:02:44,802 --> 00:02:46,485
And you're not even
repping Philly, dude.

45
00:02:46,485 --> 00:02:48,378
Well, the Hornets have
the coolest colors, man.

46
00:02:48,378 --> 00:02:52,268
I got to look phat 'cause
I'm out there selling weed,
and you got to look phat
if you're selling weed.

47
00:02:52,268 --> 00:02:55,118
And also, dude, I'm gonna
say this as your friend
- and not just your boss...

48
00:02:55,118 --> 00:02:57,283
...stop dealing drugs
at work, okay?

49
00:02:57,283 --> 00:03:00,498
- Blowing up. Oh, 9-1-1.
- Take it outside.
I don't want to see--

50
00:03:00,498 --> 00:03:03,109
- Yo, I got to make a call.
- If Smokey sees you
with that thing, man, I'm gonna get in trouble, too.

51
00:03:03,109 --> 00:03:04,691
Did you spray these down,
or what?

52
00:03:04,691 --> 00:03:07,587
'Cause-cause you
got to keep the...

53
00:03:14,462 --> 00:03:16,201
Not bad.

54
00:03:25,427 --> 00:03:28,521
All right, now, you kids
have a lot of fun, all right?

55
00:03:28,521 --> 00:03:30,916
And Daddy's got a very important
meeting to go to.

56
00:03:30,916 --> 00:03:34,012
- Oh, good luck, Daddy.
- Thank you, honey. You be safe, sweetheart.

57
00:03:34,012 --> 00:03:37,326
Dennis,
don't forget to leave
your cellular telephone on.

58
00:03:37,326 --> 00:03:40,701
You work for me now.
Yes, Father. Got it.

59
00:03:44,877 --> 00:03:48,180
There you go. Have fun.

60
00:03:48,967 --> 00:03:51,341
- Hey, guys.
- What's up, fellas?

61
00:03:51,341 --> 00:03:52,964
- There's the college guy.

62
00:03:52,964 --> 00:03:57,197
Now, see, Mac, that's how
you wear a jacket at work.
You know, Dennis looks like
Jerry Seinfeld.

63
00:03:57,197 --> 00:03:59,611
Thanks, man. Yeah, that's kind
of what I was going for. Yeah.

64
00:03:59,611 --> 00:04:02,055
I don't like how mean they are
to each other on that show.

65
00:04:02,055 --> 00:04:05,612
Aw, Sweet Dee.
So pure of heart. You know?

66
00:04:05,612 --> 00:04:08,061
- Hey, when you going
to Hollywood, Dee?
- Tomorrow.

67
00:04:08,061 --> 00:04:11,599
Yeah, this is
my last night in Philly.
I'm actually super nervous.

68
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:13,318
Oh, you got nothing
to be nervous about.

69
00:04:13,318 --> 00:04:15,589
No, you're gonna do great
out there, sis.
They're gonna love you.

70
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:18,784
You just have so much
natural charisma,
and you're so funny.

71
00:04:18,784 --> 00:04:22,278
Aw, man. Thanks, you guys.
That really means a lot to me.

72
00:04:22,278 --> 00:04:24,823
- Size 11 skates, please.

73
00:04:24,823 --> 00:04:27,958
Oh. Oh, Dee, um...

74
00:04:27,958 --> 00:04:32,320
Uh, we only carry, like,
women's up to, like,
I think maybe, like nine?

75
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,004
Oh, no, Charlie, uh,
size 11 in men's.

76
00:04:35,004 --> 00:04:37,201
- That's okay.
- Oh, right. You wear men's.

77
00:04:37,201 --> 00:04:40,310
- Yeah.
- I totally forgot.
Okay, I got those. Hang on.

78
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:41,790
- Uh, here we go.

79
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:43,423
- There we go.
- Yeah. Boom.

80
00:04:43,423 --> 00:04:45,730
Okay. Thanks, guys. I'm
gonna go skate with my friends.

81
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:48,209
- I'll see you in a little bit.
- Ah, have fun, Dee.
- See you. So sweet.
- Have fun.
- Bye.

82
00:04:48,209 --> 00:04:50,803
Such a good-hearted person.

83
00:04:50,803 --> 00:04:54,461
Guys, thank-thank you
so much for not making fun
of the size of her feet.
They're-they're very big.

84
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:57,111
- Of course not.
I would never make fun
of her physical attributes.

85
00:04:57,111 --> 00:04:58,898
Hey, you guys want
to grab a soda or something?

86
00:04:58,898 --> 00:05:01,042
- Oh, I'd love a soda.
- I'd love a soda.
All right,
let's get a quick break.

87
00:05:01,042 --> 00:05:03,017
Hey, Smokey, stepping away!

88
00:05:03,017 --> 00:05:07,604
- Huh?
- Stepping away there, boss!
- Yeah, whatever.

89
00:05:07,604 --> 00:05:12,013
Smokey loves me, dude.
Hey, he's giving me one
of those, um, email addresses.

90
00:05:12,013 --> 00:05:16,000
Email?
Mark my words,
nobody will ever use email.

91
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,317
The Internet is a fad for nerds.
- Yeah, probably.

92
00:05:19,317 --> 00:05:20,774
Let's roll.

93
00:05:22,784 --> 00:05:25,750
So, what's it like
working for your old man?

94
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:28,789
- Like, what's he actually do?
- Business.

95
00:05:28,789 --> 00:05:31,795
Oh, that's sweet, man. Like,
what kind of business is he in?

96
00:05:31,795 --> 00:05:36,328
It's complicated, you know?
There's-there's numbers
and money, you know?

97
00:05:36,328 --> 00:05:38,784
Right, but it sounds like you
don't know what the business is.

98
00:05:38,784 --> 00:05:42,623
Not yet. But, I mean, I will
at some point,
you know what I mean?

99
00:05:42,623 --> 00:05:44,541
'Cause I'll be running
the place someday, so...

100
00:05:44,541 --> 00:05:48,090
Oh. I can dig that, man.
I'm also kind of, like, climbing
the corporate ladder, you know?

101
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:50,411
I definitely see myself
running this place one day.

102
00:05:50,411 --> 00:05:52,694
- Dooley, come on, man.
No headlocks!

103
00:05:52,694 --> 00:05:55,847
I'll-I'll be running a-a
multi-million-dollar business,

104
00:05:55,847 --> 00:05:57,471
and you'll be working
at a roller rink.

105
00:05:57,471 --> 00:05:59,603
Yeah, there's a lot of money
in roller-skating, like,

106
00:05:59,603 --> 00:06:03,253
you would not believe
how many quarters
I find in these
vending machines.

107
00:06:03,253 --> 00:06:06,208
You're talking about thumbing
through vending machines
for loose change.

108
00:06:06,208 --> 00:06:08,581
You think that's comparable
to my thing?

109
00:06:08,581 --> 00:06:11,204
Well, that one's empty,
but, yeah, you never know.

110
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:14,173
- Oh, is that my beeper?
- Oh, no, that's my mobile phone.

111
00:06:14,173 --> 00:06:15,430
Yeah, I don't have
anything that beeps.

112
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:18,465
Yeah, hang on.
Oh, it's-it's my dad.

113
00:06:18,465 --> 00:06:20,238
Hello, Father.

114
00:06:21,602 --> 00:06:24,200
Yeah. Yes. Uh, yeah, right away.
Guys, I got to run.

115
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,845
Uh, my dad forgot his briefcase,
and he needs it
for an important meeting, so...

116
00:06:26,845 --> 00:06:29,511
- Oh, cool.
What's the meeting about?
- Business, man.

117
00:06:29,511 --> 00:06:31,895
I, like, I don't... I got to go.
I can't make him mad, okay?

118
00:06:31,895 --> 00:06:33,185
I'm on my way, Father.

119
00:06:33,185 --> 00:06:35,943
Mobile phones. Fads for yuppies.

120
00:06:35,943 --> 00:06:39,645
Mark my words, Charlie, those
things will never catch on.

121
00:06:52,715 --> 00:06:55,630
- Ah, my special little helper.
I couldn't do it without you.

122
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:58,054
- Hold the briefcase.
- Okay. Thanks, Father.

123
00:06:58,054 --> 00:07:01,884
Oh, not you.
I was talking about
this little guy. Right here.

124
00:07:01,884 --> 00:07:03,620
- You're taking pills?
- Mm. Mm.

125
00:07:04,971 --> 00:07:07,511
Ah. Yeah.
It enhances my performance

126
00:07:07,511 --> 00:07:10,342
and impresses my colleague,
if you know what I'm saying?

127
00:07:10,342 --> 00:07:12,675
- Oh, wow, okay,
that makes sense. Yeah.

128
00:07:12,675 --> 00:07:16,600
- Ticktock, buddy.
Your hour's almost up.
- Uh, be right there, hon.

129
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:20,245
- Oh, she sounds tough.
- Oh, you have no idea.
Okay, you can go.

130
00:07:20,245 --> 00:07:22,617
No, wait, wait.
Dad, Dad, wait, wait.
Come here, come here.

131
00:07:22,617 --> 00:07:26,667
Listen, if I may be so bold,
I know you like to usually
do your business in private,

132
00:07:26,667 --> 00:07:31,679
- but, uh, I'd like to join you.
- Huh? You-you want to join us?

133
00:07:31,679 --> 00:07:34,824
Yeah. O-Or I can just sit
in the corner and watch.
I-I just want to learn.

134
00:07:34,824 --> 00:07:37,818
Well-well-well, that's-that's
a little weird, Dennis.
I-I don't know about that.

135
00:07:37,818 --> 00:07:40,757
How am I supposed to learn
if you don't show me
how to do it?

136
00:07:40,757 --> 00:07:44,687
- You don't know how?
- No.
I don't know anything.

137
00:07:44,687 --> 00:07:48,371
- The guys were teasing me
about it earlier.
- Well, I probably
would tease you, too.

138
00:07:48,371 --> 00:07:51,122
- Yeah, but-but,
I mean, it's not my fault.
You never showed me anything.

139
00:07:51,198 --> 00:07:54,270
I thought this was something
you'd learn in school.

140
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:59,205
Well, I-I don't,
I don't love this Dennis, but,
if you want, you can sit
in the corner and watch.

141
00:07:59,205 --> 00:08:02,734
But no eye contact
'cause that'll throw me
off my game.
- O-Okay.

142
00:08:02,734 --> 00:08:06,672
- All right.
Come on, let's go in
before the pill kicks in.
- Y-Yeah. Okay.

143
00:08:06,672 --> 00:08:08,499
Honey.

144
00:08:09,631 --> 00:08:13,232
Yeah, what I'm saying is
Silly String's not so silly
when it's stuck
in a wheel bearing.

145
00:08:13,232 --> 00:08:16,768
So, actions do have
consequences. You know?

146
00:08:16,768 --> 00:08:19,928
Smokey! Filing a damage report
here, boss.

147
00:08:19,928 --> 00:08:23,756
I don't know what to tell you.
I'm gonna have to
sell the joint.

148
00:08:23,756 --> 00:08:27,021
Lot of good people
are gonna lose their jobs.

149
00:08:27,021 --> 00:08:30,801
Kills me, but it's over.

150
00:08:34,271 --> 00:08:36,003
Oh, no.

151
00:08:36,003 --> 00:08:39,023
18, 19.

152
00:08:39,023 --> 00:08:42,154
Worth every penny.
2,000.

153
00:08:42,154 --> 00:08:44,572
There's a little
something in there for you.
- Yeah, whatever.

154
00:08:44,572 --> 00:08:46,821
- Say hello to your sister.

155
00:08:47,152 --> 00:08:50,060
Well, there you go. You happy?

156
00:08:51,875 --> 00:08:55,512
- What was that?
- That's how it's done.

157
00:08:55,512 --> 00:08:58,678
Uh, it was a little fast,
but she was hot.

158
00:08:58,817 --> 00:09:02,881
I f... I feel like
I just watched you
have sex with a prostitute.

159
00:09:02,881 --> 00:09:05,008
- Yeah.
- Why?

160
00:09:05,008 --> 00:09:06,761
What do you mean why?
It was your idea.

161
00:09:06,761 --> 00:09:11,335
- I didn't want
to watch you have sex.
- I didn't want you
to watch me have sex, either.

162
00:09:11,335 --> 00:09:15,379
- I thought you were gonna
show me what you do at work.
- This is what I do at work.

163
00:09:15,379 --> 00:09:19,825
- Well...
does Mom know about this?
- Don't bring
your mother into this.
I'm not gonna
let you watch next time.

164
00:09:19,825 --> 00:09:22,213
I don't want to watch next time!

165
00:09:22,257 --> 00:09:23,500
I didn't want
to watch this time!

166
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:26,820
All right, look,
you're officially fired.
What-what?

167
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:29,409
This is not working out
for me, Dennis. You-you...

168
00:09:29,409 --> 00:09:32,725
you watched me bang, I mean,
and now you're whining.

169
00:09:32,725 --> 00:09:35,460
You're gonna go cry
to your mommy. It's too much.

170
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:38,429
I don't even know what it is
I'm being fired from.

171
00:09:38,429 --> 00:09:42,056
Look... Here.
Here's five grand.

172
00:09:42,056 --> 00:09:45,849
- What-what is this?
- That's to keep your mouth shut.
That's your paycheck.

173
00:09:45,849 --> 00:09:48,656
I-I don't understand.
What is happening?

174
00:09:48,656 --> 00:09:50,839
- That's your severance pay.
- My sever...

175
00:09:50,839 --> 00:09:54,914
- Go on.
- I don't understand any of this!

176
00:09:56,360 --> 00:10:01,654
Sup, son.
I'm having the best night.
I just sold two ounces
of Compton Endo.

177
00:10:01,654 --> 00:10:05,172
Yeah, well, all right,
I-I hate to rain on your
drug-dealing parade,

178
00:10:05,172 --> 00:10:08,164
but, um,
Smokey's selling
this joint, man.

179
00:10:08,164 --> 00:10:12,154
So what? I could
deal drugs wherever.
Hey, you should
come work for me, man.

180
00:10:12,154 --> 00:10:15,821
- I'm making mad Benjamins, son.
- Holy shit.

181
00:10:15,821 --> 00:10:18,511
Whoa, dude, there's got to be,
like, $80 in there.

182
00:10:18,511 --> 00:10:22,223
It's $4,000, Charlie.
Yeah, I made it in,
like, two hours.

183
00:10:22,223 --> 00:10:23,508
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

184
00:10:23,508 --> 00:10:27,306
Shit, man, but, like,
isn't dealing drugs,
isn't that kind of dangerous?

185
00:10:27,306 --> 00:10:32,536
Damn straight it is, Charlie.
That's why I got myself a gat.

186
00:10:34,837 --> 00:10:37,328
- Dude. You have a gun?
- Yeah. Cool, huh?

187
00:10:37,328 --> 00:10:40,683
Put that shit away, all right?
Don't let Smokey
see you with that.

188
00:10:40,683 --> 00:10:42,312
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Sweet Dee.
- Hey, Dee.

189
00:10:42,312 --> 00:10:47,404
Charlie, can you tighten
the axle nuts on these?
My friends and I are working on
sort of a farewell routine.

190
00:10:47,404 --> 00:10:50,819
Oh, got to tighten
them Dee's nuts.

191
00:10:51,451 --> 00:10:55,105
Dee's nuts.
They're your nuts,
so I said, "Dee's nuts." Like...

192
00:10:55,105 --> 00:10:58,458
Yeah, I-I'm sorry. I just don't
find crass humor that funny.

193
00:10:58,458 --> 00:11:00,398
- Yeah.
- Oh, yeah, sorry.

194
00:11:00,398 --> 00:11:04,178
Oh, yeah. Um, but, Dee,
just a quick heads-up,
like, if I tighten up
these nuts, it's gonna...

195
00:11:04,178 --> 00:11:06,490
- Dee's nuts. Now I said it.

196
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:08,501
- That happens.
- I'm so sorry.

197
00:11:08,563 --> 00:11:13,800
But-but in all seriousness,
if-if I do tighten up the, uh,
the axle nuts,
it's gonna slow you down.

198
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:18,271
I know. The thing is,
my friends,
they're just not as fast as me,
and I don't want to hurt
their self-esteem,

199
00:11:18,271 --> 00:11:20,894
so I just figured if I make
myself slower, everyone's happy.

200
00:11:20,894 --> 00:11:22,897
- Oh, that's super nice of you.
- Oh, yeah.

201
00:11:22,897 --> 00:11:25,297
Hey, and don't forget,
positive energy.

202
00:11:25,297 --> 00:11:27,412
- Positive energy.
- Cool.
- Positive.

203
00:11:27,412 --> 00:11:29,352
- There's my beeper.
- Oh, shit.

204
00:11:29,352 --> 00:11:31,927
That thing is really cool.
I'll admit that.

205
00:11:31,927 --> 00:11:36,041
Cool? Charlie, in 20 years,
everybody's gonna have a beeper.
Mark my words.

206
00:11:36,041 --> 00:11:39,803
Yeah, yeah. Also, you keep
saying that, and I don't know
if you're, like,
fully expecting me

207
00:11:39,803 --> 00:11:42,273
to, like,
mark these words down
'cause
I don't have, like, a pen on me.

208
00:11:42,273 --> 00:11:44,603
Okay, come on, let's go.
They're-they're outside.

209
00:11:44,603 --> 00:11:46,753
Uh, all right.
Stepping away, Smoke.

210
00:11:46,753 --> 00:11:48,864
All right, be cool.
Just play it cool, man.

211
00:11:48,864 --> 00:11:51,579
Yeah, I'm just nervous, dude.
I've never done something
against the law,
really, like this.

212
00:11:51,579 --> 00:11:53,740
Nah, it's-it's-it's
not that hard.

213
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:56,376
- Oh, here they come.
- Is this the guy?
These are our guys?

214
00:11:56,442 --> 00:11:58,054
- Yeah, I think that's him. Yeah.
Yeah, that's him. Okay.

215
00:11:58,054 --> 00:12:02,310
It's very easy. It's very easy.
Just walk up there,
you say, "How much?"
"How much do you want?"

216
00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:06,711
- They tell you, and then...
- Uh-huh.
...you throw the bags in,
they throw the money out,
and that's it.
End of transaction.

217
00:12:06,711 --> 00:12:10,125
Okay, cool. I-I can do that.
And then, um, maybe
I'll introduce myself, too?

218
00:12:10,125 --> 00:12:12,360
Put a name to the face 'cause
customer service is important.

219
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:16,595
- No.
No, no, don't do that
because it's not.
It's a drug deal.

220
00:12:16,595 --> 00:12:20,570
Yeah, but if they don't feel
comfortable, you know, like,
knowing me, they might not
return as customers.

221
00:12:20,570 --> 00:12:24,347
You don't want them to know you.
They will return,
no matter what,
because they're
addicted to the drugs.

222
00:12:24,347 --> 00:12:26,889
- That's how it works.
- Oh. Okay, cool.

223
00:12:26,889 --> 00:12:29,325
One more thing.
Take off the skates.

224
00:12:29,325 --> 00:12:33,443
- Yeah, but if I take off
the skates, I'm gonna have to
walk over there in my socks
'cause I skated to work today.

225
00:12:33,443 --> 00:12:35,524
- Oh, Jesus Christ.
- Yeah, that's not gonna
look cool, right?

226
00:12:35,524 --> 00:12:38,389
Uh, that-that's them.
Okay, I'll walk on my toes,
 so you can't tell
I'm on skates.

227
00:12:38,389 --> 00:12:41,127
- What? No.
You might as well just,
you might as well
just skate over.

228
00:12:41,127 --> 00:12:43,092
Oh, Jesus Christ.

229
00:12:43,092 --> 00:12:44,958
Coming.

230
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:46,967
O-One minute.

231
00:12:47,461 --> 00:12:49,631
- Evening.

232
00:12:55,777 --> 00:12:58,437
Jesus Christ.

233
00:12:59,413 --> 00:13:05,107
- Hi. I-I'm Charlie.
I'll be taking care
of you guys this evening.

234
00:13:05,107 --> 00:13:07,928
- Uh, uh, how we doing?
- Let me get five.

235
00:13:07,928 --> 00:13:11,778
F-Five, yeah, sure.
Uh, five for the fine fella.

236
00:13:11,778 --> 00:13:13,762
"I got five on it."

237
00:13:13,762 --> 00:13:18,347
Sorry, it's...
I'm a little thrown off.
I was expecting
you guys to be
so much older than me. Um...

238
00:13:18,347 --> 00:13:21,304
One second.
Let me get it out here.

239
00:13:21,304 --> 00:13:26,003
Okay. Five. One, two, three...

240
00:13:26,003 --> 00:13:29,023
 Whoa. Dropped one.
Sorry. It's three, four, five.

241
00:13:29,023 --> 00:13:32,663
Sorry. It's my,
it's my first night.
I-I'm in training, so...

242
00:13:32,663 --> 00:13:36,586
- Uh, thank you
for your patience.
Um, so I'm gonna need 40, uh,

243
00:13:36,586 --> 00:13:39,506
$40...
- for, uh...

244
00:13:39,506 --> 00:13:42,088
I'm gonna-- I'm gonna need $40!

245
00:13:42,088 --> 00:13:43,539
Oh, no, he didn't.

246
00:13:45,909 --> 00:13:47,906
We got a problem here, fellas?

247
00:13:47,906 --> 00:13:50,881
- Yeah, he-he-he's got
a gun, so...
- That's a gat.
- I got a gat.

248
00:13:50,881 --> 00:13:52,739
- Shoot the tires.
- Um...

249
00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:59,130
- What the hell is this?
- Uh, that's the handle.
Just the handle.

250
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:00,787
I can see that. You're
carrying around a gun handle?

251
00:14:00,787 --> 00:14:03,178
Yeah, I found it in the trash.
- It's still cool, though.
- Oh, my God.

252
00:14:03,178 --> 00:14:05,772
Dude, that was so stupid.
We could've gotten killed, Mac.

253
00:14:05,772 --> 00:14:09,962
No, no, there's no b--
there's no bullets.
You can't get killed
'cause there's not--
You can't get shot.

254
00:14:09,962 --> 00:14:12,053
With their gun!
Oh, with their gun.

255
00:14:12,053 --> 00:14:13,635
Yeah, with their gun
we could've gotten killed.

256
00:14:14,723 --> 00:14:17,247
Oh! Got one.

257
00:14:17,291 --> 00:14:19,641
All right, well,
look on the bright side, Mac.

258
00:14:19,684 --> 00:14:20,903
We just made a quick 25 cents.

259
00:14:20,947 --> 00:14:24,341
Hey. Hey, guys.
Why the long faces?

260
00:14:24,385 --> 00:14:26,474
Smokey's selling the rink.

261
00:14:26,517 --> 00:14:27,649
- What?
- Yeah.

262
00:14:27,692 --> 00:14:28,911
And Mac's
a terrible drug dealer,

263
00:14:28,955 --> 00:14:31,261
as am I, apparently.

264
00:14:31,305 --> 00:14:33,611
I just don't know what I'm gonna
do with the rest of my life now.

265
00:14:33,655 --> 00:14:35,091
How was work with your dad?

266
00:14:35,135 --> 00:14:37,702
Oh, uh, yeah, it was cool.
You know, um,

267
00:14:37,746 --> 00:14:39,966
I learned a lot, but I-I
don't really think it's for me.

268
00:14:40,009 --> 00:14:41,358
Oh?

269
00:14:41,402 --> 00:14:42,707
Really? Why? Like, what it is?

270
00:14:42,751 --> 00:14:44,187
What-What's the work?

271
00:14:44,231 --> 00:14:47,103
Uh, it's-it's-it's
complicated, you know?

272
00:14:47,147 --> 00:14:49,323
It-It's, um, messy,

273
00:14:49,366 --> 00:14:51,673
and-and-and I don't want
to describe what I saw.

274
00:14:51,716 --> 00:14:52,935
Why?

275
00:14:52,979 --> 00:14:54,632
Look, suffice it to say,

276
00:14:54,676 --> 00:14:56,112
I-I don't want to have
anything to do

277
00:14:56,156 --> 00:14:57,940
with that kind of business,
you know what I mean?

278
00:14:57,984 --> 00:14:59,246
And I'm starting to think
that my dad's a bad man.

279
00:14:59,289 --> 00:15:00,551
Really?

280
00:15:00,595 --> 00:15:02,075
You know what, man?

281
00:15:02,118 --> 00:15:04,947
You can go your own way.
You're your own man.

282
00:15:04,991 --> 00:15:06,470
Mark my words,

283
00:15:06,514 --> 00:15:08,516
you're probably never
gonna see that guy again

284
00:15:08,559 --> 00:15:10,257
for the rest of your life.

285
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:11,258
I hope not.

286
00:15:11,301 --> 00:15:12,563
Yeah.

287
00:15:12,607 --> 00:15:14,957
Guys, check this out.

288
00:15:15,001 --> 00:15:16,480
What if we...

289
00:15:16,524 --> 00:15:19,048
what if we went into business,
like, for ourselves?

290
00:15:19,092 --> 00:15:21,181
- Yeah.
- You know?
- Yeah.

291
00:15:21,224 --> 00:15:23,052
Like-like, we do what Dennis's
dad does at work, right,

292
00:15:23,096 --> 00:15:24,575
but we do it with each other.

293
00:15:24,619 --> 00:15:27,622
You don't want to do
what my dad does, okay?

294
00:15:27,665 --> 00:15:29,580
And definitely not
with each other.

295
00:15:29,624 --> 00:15:31,234
- All right.
- Um, so, I'd like to clarify

296
00:15:31,278 --> 00:15:32,670
by saying that I think
what we should do

297
00:15:32,714 --> 00:15:34,281
is invest in ourselves.

298
00:15:34,324 --> 00:15:35,978
Yeah, I mean, like,
right, that's what I mean.

299
00:15:36,022 --> 00:15:37,806
Like, check this out, like, what
if we buy the rink from Smokey?

300
00:15:37,849 --> 00:15:39,242
Oh, shit.

301
00:15:39,286 --> 00:15:41,157
- We own the roller rink?
- Yeah.

302
00:15:41,201 --> 00:15:42,942
Like, the three of us,
together as partners?

303
00:15:42,985 --> 00:15:44,117
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh.

304
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,554
I-I got four grand right here.

305
00:15:46,597 --> 00:15:48,077
Oh, my God. That's crazy.

306
00:15:48,121 --> 00:15:49,513
I just got five grand
from my dad.

307
00:15:49,557 --> 00:15:51,733
Oh, dudes, that's perfect.
I just got 25 cents,

308
00:15:51,776 --> 00:15:53,561
uh, from the machine over there.

309
00:15:53,604 --> 00:15:57,043
25 cents is not gonna
get us shit, man.

310
00:15:57,086 --> 00:15:58,609
Oh, no, I mean,
I just got it now.

311
00:15:58,653 --> 00:16:00,002
I have more saved up.

312
00:16:00,046 --> 00:16:01,569
Well, okay, well,
how much do you have total?

313
00:16:01,612 --> 00:16:04,050
From the machines
and my paycheck

314
00:16:04,093 --> 00:16:06,008
and just, like,
saving the quarters and shit,

315
00:16:06,052 --> 00:16:08,097
I've saved up, like, $57,000.

316
00:16:13,059 --> 00:16:15,409
- Holy shit, man.
- Oh, that's-that's-that's...

317
00:16:15,452 --> 00:16:16,540
- Uh...
- You know what?

318
00:16:16,584 --> 00:16:17,802
That actually might be enough

319
00:16:17,846 --> 00:16:19,195
- for an equal partnership
with us.
- Yes.

320
00:16:19,239 --> 00:16:21,023
- Yeah. Well...
- Yeah.

321
00:16:21,067 --> 00:16:23,069
- Equal doesn't quite
make sense...
- Hey, you know what,

322
00:16:23,112 --> 00:16:24,374
I'm starving.
Do they have sandwiches here?

323
00:16:24,418 --> 00:16:26,246
Well, yeah, you know,
they do have sandwiches.

324
00:16:26,289 --> 00:16:27,638
- Would you like a sandwich?
- Yeah. You want something
with meat on it?

325
00:16:27,682 --> 00:16:29,466
The sandwiches
are good, but, like...

326
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:30,641
I'm-I'm paying.
I'll pay for the sandwich.

327
00:16:30,685 --> 00:16:32,774
Equal just doesn't
totally make sense.

328
00:16:32,817 --> 00:16:34,602
Let's give it up for
the Sweet Dee Skaters.

329
00:16:34,645 --> 00:16:35,646
- They're-they're
starting the dance.
- All right, here we go.

330
00:16:37,039 --> 00:16:38,606
And then we'll have
sandwiches...

331
00:16:38,649 --> 00:16:40,303
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Absolutely. Oh, man.
- Let's go, Dee!

332
00:16:40,347 --> 00:16:42,914
- Yeah. Looking good.
All right. Go, Dee!

333
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:45,265
- Oh, thanks, guys. You rock!
Let's go, Sweet Dee!

334
00:16:45,308 --> 00:16:46,266
Come on, Dee.

335
00:16:46,309 --> 00:16:47,354
Yeah. All right. Let's go, sis.

336
00:16:47,397 --> 00:16:48,920
Come on, Dee!

337
00:16:57,233 --> 00:17:01,368
? Take this pink ribbon
off my eyes?

338
00:17:01,411 --> 00:17:05,415
? I'm exposed,
and it's no big surprise?

339
00:17:05,459 --> 00:17:07,504
? Don't you think I know?

340
00:17:07,548 --> 00:17:10,159
? Exactly where I stand??

341
00:17:10,203 --> 00:17:12,988
? This world
is forcing me to hold?

342
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:15,077
? Your hand?

343
00:17:15,121 --> 00:17:17,123
? 'Cause I'm just a girl...?

344
00:17:17,166 --> 00:17:19,951
Look at her go, man.
Yeah, she's really flying, huh?

345
00:17:19,995 --> 00:17:21,910
Imagine if she didn't have to
slow down for her friends.

346
00:17:21,953 --> 00:17:23,825
She doesn't have to. No, no, no.

347
00:17:23,868 --> 00:17:25,261
I-I-- When she asked me
to tighten her skates,

348
00:17:25,305 --> 00:17:26,741
I secretly loosened them,
you know,

349
00:17:26,784 --> 00:17:28,177
'cause real friends don't
slow each other down, right?

350
00:17:28,221 --> 00:17:29,352
They help them soar.

351
00:17:29,396 --> 00:17:32,312
? ...let me have any rights...?

352
00:17:32,355 --> 00:17:35,010
Oh. Oh!

353
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:36,316
- Oh!
- Oh, shit!
- Ooh!

354
00:17:36,359 --> 00:17:37,752
Goddamn.

355
00:17:37,795 --> 00:17:39,536
Ooh. That was brutal.

356
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:40,885
You all right?

357
00:17:40,929 --> 00:17:43,279
Hey. Stop it! Get off me, bitch!

358
00:17:45,151 --> 00:17:46,500
Hey, sis, are-are you okay?

359
00:17:46,543 --> 00:17:47,762
You hit your head
pretty hard there.

360
00:17:47,805 --> 00:17:51,070
Yeah, I'm fine,
you small-haired cunt.

361
00:17:51,113 --> 00:17:52,984
- Whoa.
- What? Excuse me?

362
00:17:53,028 --> 00:17:55,117
It was a joke, okay?

363
00:17:55,161 --> 00:17:57,032
Oh, you don't understand humor?

364
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:58,033
It was a joke.
That's why she was...

365
00:17:58,077 --> 00:17:59,339
- Oh.
- Oh.

366
00:17:59,382 --> 00:18:01,210
Hey-hey, Dee, um,
we're gonna buy the rink.

367
00:18:01,254 --> 00:18:02,472
Do you want to be
part-owner with us?

368
00:18:02,516 --> 00:18:04,431
Oh, oh, oh, are you?

369
00:18:04,474 --> 00:18:06,128
Yeah, we could really use
your positive attitude.

370
00:18:06,172 --> 00:18:08,130
Oh, oh, oh, could you?

371
00:18:08,174 --> 00:18:09,436
You know
what you could also use?

372
00:18:09,479 --> 00:18:11,264
A breath mint
'cause your mouth smells

373
00:18:11,307 --> 00:18:13,092
like you just ate
a giant slice of shit pizza.

374
00:18:15,355 --> 00:18:18,097
Okay, I'm confused, Dee.
D-Do you want to be in?

375
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:20,447
N-N-N-N-No, Charlie.

376
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:22,492
Thank you, anyway,
but I don't want to be involved

377
00:18:22,536 --> 00:18:24,059
with you losers, okay?
'Cause you're losers.

378
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:25,278
I'm moving to Hollywood.

379
00:18:25,321 --> 00:18:27,323
I'm gonna get rich,
I'm gonna get famous,

380
00:18:27,367 --> 00:18:28,890
and I'm probably
gonna marry Scott Wolf.

381
00:18:30,979 --> 00:18:33,503
Get out of my way, bitch!
Leave me alone!

382
00:18:33,547 --> 00:18:36,941
Sweet Dee is not being
very sweet.

383
00:18:36,985 --> 00:18:37,942
You know what?
She just got her bell rung.

384
00:18:37,986 --> 00:18:38,987
She's gonna be fine.

385
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:40,293
Oh, dude,
that's what it is, right?

386
00:18:40,336 --> 00:18:42,251
I-I'm sure by tomorrow
it'll wear off,

387
00:18:42,295 --> 00:18:44,514
- and she'll be back to spreading
her sunshine again, right?

388
00:18:44,558 --> 00:18:46,560
- Yeah.
- All right, come on,
let's go buy this rink.

389
00:18:46,603 --> 00:18:47,735
- Yeah. Let's do it.
- All right. Let's go buy
a roller rink.

390
00:18:47,778 --> 00:18:48,910
Smokey!

391
00:18:48,953 --> 00:18:51,086
You want to buy my joint?

392
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:53,393
Absolutely, Smokey.
I mean, look, uh,

393
00:18:53,436 --> 00:18:55,569
we heard you're selling it,
and we-we want to be the buyers.

394
00:18:55,612 --> 00:18:57,484
Yeah, and we will pay any price.

395
00:18:57,527 --> 00:18:58,789
Yeah. Well, well,
hang-hang on a second.

396
00:18:58,833 --> 00:19:00,487
No, we won't pay any price.

397
00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:02,489
We'll pay the appropriate price
for a roller rink.

398
00:19:02,532 --> 00:19:04,795
The rink?

399
00:19:04,839 --> 00:19:06,580
I don't own this place.

400
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:08,059
I just work here
for the free parking.

401
00:19:08,103 --> 00:19:09,713
- Oh.
- Oh.

402
00:19:09,757 --> 00:19:12,107
I own the bar around the corner.

403
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:13,456
- There's a bar
around the corner?
- Yeah.

404
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:14,849
Yeah.

405
00:19:14,892 --> 00:19:17,025
That place is a real dump.

406
00:19:17,068 --> 00:19:18,722
- Oh. Okay. Uh...
- Okay.

407
00:19:18,766 --> 00:19:21,116
- Uh, we'll take it. Any price.
- Well, well, hang on a second.

408
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,205
- We don't know if we'll take it.
We haven't even seen it yet.
- Stop saying that.

409
00:19:23,249 --> 00:19:25,599
You are a terrible negotiator.
How do you...?

410
00:19:25,642 --> 00:19:26,861
He's a really bad drug dealer,
too, man.

411
00:19:26,904 --> 00:19:28,123
I can tell.
Yeah.

412
00:19:34,912 --> 00:19:37,393
Paddy's, huh?

413
00:19:37,437 --> 00:19:39,613
You guys like that name?

414
00:19:39,656 --> 00:19:41,223
- No.
- No.
- No, right?

415
00:19:41,267 --> 00:19:42,442
- No, it's terrible.
- It's pretty bad.
- We'll change it.

416
00:19:42,485 --> 00:19:43,573
- Yeah.
- Definitely. First thing we do.

417
00:19:43,617 --> 00:19:45,009
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

418
00:19:45,053 --> 00:19:46,228
- Should we check it out?
- Yeah.

419
00:19:46,272 --> 00:19:48,230
Smells like fish.
You guys smell that?

420
00:19:48,274 --> 00:19:50,276
- Yeah.
- It does smell like fish.

421
00:19:50,319 --> 00:19:51,755
- Get a cooler sign, you know?
- Yeah.

422
00:19:51,799 --> 00:19:53,583
'Cause it's kind of, like,
old and wooden.

423
00:19:56,151 --> 00:19:58,109
Huh.

424
00:19:58,153 --> 00:19:59,241
Yeah, uh...

425
00:20:01,156 --> 00:20:02,462
I mean, you know,

426
00:20:02,505 --> 00:20:03,811
doesn't-doesn't quite
have the same pageantry

427
00:20:03,854 --> 00:20:06,248
as a roller rink, but, uh...

428
00:20:06,292 --> 00:20:09,164
Well, there's a-a palpable
sadness in here.

429
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:10,557
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- I feel that.

430
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,907
- And a stink, right?
Like... Yeah.
- Yeah.

431
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:15,257
But that said, I mean,
you know, it's got potential.

432
00:20:15,301 --> 00:20:16,519
Right. It doesn't have
to be this, right?

433
00:20:16,563 --> 00:20:18,217
Like, check it out.

434
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:20,393
We could gut this place,
make it totally our own, right?

435
00:20:20,436 --> 00:20:22,177
- Yes. Yes!
- Make it whatever we want.
- Yes.

436
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:25,398
Yes. We could become really
successful bar owners, right?

437
00:20:25,441 --> 00:20:26,964
- Of course we could, dude.
- Like, the most

438
00:20:27,008 --> 00:20:29,140
successful bar owners in all
of South Philadelphia,

439
00:20:29,184 --> 00:20:30,620
- in all of the country.
- That's reasonable.

440
00:20:30,664 --> 00:20:32,274
Guys, mark my words,

441
00:20:32,318 --> 00:20:35,059
when we're finished
with this place,

442
00:20:35,103 --> 00:20:37,192
you're not even
gonna recognize it.

443
00:20:43,285 --> 00:20:45,418
- I got a lot of things wrong.
- Yeah.

444
00:20:45,461 --> 00:20:47,333
Yeah. We really didn't
change that much.

445
00:20:47,376 --> 00:20:50,249
No. No, you haven't even
changed clothes, for instance.

446
00:20:50,292 --> 00:20:51,641
You're still wearing
the same sweatshirt.

447
00:20:51,685 --> 00:20:54,035
- Hey, can I talk to you guys

448
00:20:54,078 --> 00:20:56,255
about the, uh, percentage
shares of the bar for a second?

449
00:20:56,298 --> 00:20:57,691
Oh, shit. Uh...

450
00:20:57,734 --> 00:20:58,822
Sandwiches.
We were gonna get...

451
00:20:58,866 --> 00:21:00,520
Oh, yeah, we-we got,
uh, sandwiches.

452
00:21:00,563 --> 00:21:02,043
- Yeah, we got sandwiches
from a place, and, uh...
- Are you hungry?

453
00:21:02,086 --> 00:21:03,087
Yeah, you hungry?
You want a sandwich?

454
00:21:03,131 --> 00:21:05,133
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

455
00:21:05,176 --> 00:21:07,309
- You're gonna
have to pay for it.
- Let's get Charlie a sandwich.

456
00:21:07,353 --> 00:21:09,659
I'm gonna check
the sandwich thing out.
