1
00:00:00,753 --> 00:00:04,999
FROM PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN.

2
00:00:10,702 --> 00:00:13,207
>> HI.
GOOD EVENING, AMERICA.

3
00:00:13,207 --> 00:00:15,081
IT'S ALMOST HALLOWEEN.

4
00:00:15,081 --> 00:00:17,887
I'M NOT OUT OF BREATH.
I'M JUST EXCITED

5
00:00:17,887 --> 00:00:23,285
BECAUSE
HALLOWEEN IS THE GREATEST
HOLIDAY IN THE WORLD.

6
00:00:23,285 --> 00:00:25,843
THE WORLD.

7
00:00:25,843 --> 00:00:28,731
BUT LOOK, BOTTOM LINE,

8
00:00:28,731 --> 00:00:32,255
WORLD IS
A PRETTY SCARY PLACE RIGHT NOW,

9
00:00:32,255 --> 00:00:35,142
WARS, SHOOTINGS, CLIMATE CHANGE,

10
00:00:35,142 --> 00:00:38,521
EVERYTHING IN THE NEW BRITNEY
BOOK.

11
00:00:38,521 --> 00:00:42,221
I WANT TO PUT EVERYONE AT EASE.

12
00:00:42,221 --> 00:00:46,294
NOTHING PUTS PEOPLE AT EASE LIKE
AN 80-YEAR-OLD MAN

13
00:00:46,294 --> 00:00:49,385
HANGING
HALLOWEEN DECORATIONS.

14
00:00:49,385 --> 00:00:52,810
SO COME ON, JOIN ME.

15
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:56,569
WE'LL WALK OVER HERE TO THE
LADDER.

16
00:00:57,978 --> 00:01:00,618
HERE WE GO.

17
00:01:00,618 --> 00:01:04,457
YOUR OLD BOY JOE IS GOING TO
CLIMB A LADDER.

18
00:01:04,457 --> 00:01:07,706
HERE YOU GO, JOE.

19
00:01:07,706 --> 00:01:11,211
OH, YEAH, BABY.

20
00:01:11,211 --> 00:01:14,591
DOING ALL RIGHT.
STEP TWO.
YEAH.

21
00:01:14,591 --> 00:01:17,988
RELAX.
I'M NOT GOING TO FALL.

22
00:01:17,988 --> 00:01:22,100
ALL RIGHT.
HERE WE GO.
HERE WE GO FOR THREE.
ALL RIGHT.

23
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:25,341
WHOO, WHAT A MAN, WHAT A MAN,

24
00:01:25,341 --> 00:01:27,357
WHAT A MAN, WHAT A MIGHTY FINE
MAN.

25
00:01:27,357 --> 00:01:30,833
LITTLE SHAKY.
WE CAN DO THAT.

26
00:01:30,833 --> 00:01:33,779
ALL RIGHT.
RELAX.

27
00:01:33,779 --> 00:01:36,651
THAT NEEDS TO GO WAY UP THERE.

28
00:01:36,651 --> 00:01:39,707
ON SECOND THOUGHT, LET'S DO THAT
LATER.

29
00:01:39,707 --> 00:01:43,256
ALL RIGHT.
BUT, SEE, LADDERS ARE FUN,
THOUGH.

30
00:01:43,256 --> 00:01:47,516
SEE, WHEN I WAS A KID, LADDERS
DOES CUTTING-EDGE TECHNOLOGY.

31
00:01:47,516 --> 00:01:50,307
THIS WAS LIKE AN iPAD.

32
00:01:50,307 --> 00:01:53,916
ALL RIGHT.
LOOK AT THIS OVER HERE.

33
00:01:53,916 --> 00:01:56,512
LOOK AT THIS SPOOKY DECORATION.

34
00:01:56,512 --> 00:01:59,293
THAT'S A SEVERED ARM.

35
00:01:59,293 --> 00:02:02,022
OH, SHOOT.
OH, NO.

36
00:02:02,022 --> 00:02:04,398
THAT'S NOT A DECORATION.

37
00:02:04,398 --> 00:02:08,956
THAT'S AN ARM OUR DOG COMMANDER
RIPPED OFF A SECRET SERVICE
AGENT.

38
00:02:08,956 --> 00:02:11,299
OH WELL.

39
00:02:12,326 --> 00:02:13,830
WHERE WAS I?

40
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:16,784
OH, RIGHT.
IT'S HALLOWEEN.

41
00:02:16,784 --> 00:02:18,688
I LOVE HALLOWEEN.

42
00:02:18,688 --> 00:02:23,286
IN FACT, A LOT OF MY CLOSEST
FRIENDS ARE GHOSTS.

43
00:02:23,772 --> 00:02:27,717
THAT'S WHY I GOT TO PLAN FOR
HALLOWEEN.

44
00:02:27,717 --> 00:02:30,474
IT'S CALLED BOO BACK BOOER.

45
00:02:30,474 --> 00:02:34,261
IT'S WITH ALL THE CLASSICS,
GOBLINS, GHOULS,

46
00:02:34,261 --> 00:02:36,428
AND OF COURSE
THE GRIM REAPER,

47
00:02:36,428 --> 00:02:40,557
WHO I
PHYSICALLY FIGHT EVERY SINGLE
DAY.

48
00:02:40,557 --> 00:02:44,195
BECAUSE WE GOT TO STAY POSITIVE,
FOLKS.

49
00:02:44,195 --> 00:02:47,729
CRIME IS DOWN, UNEMPLOYMENT IS DOWN,

50
00:02:47,729 --> 00:02:51,366
STOCK MARKET IS DOWN.

51
00:02:51,366 --> 00:02:53,991
WELL, TWO OUT OF THREE AIN'T
BAD.

52
00:02:53,991 --> 00:02:56,890
HEY, IT'S RIGHT ON TIME,

53
00:02:56,890 --> 00:03:00,375
A WHITE HOUSE AIDE TO HELP ME PUT UP THE
COBWEBS.

54
00:03:00,375 --> 00:03:02,644
>> ME?
NO, I'M NOT AN AIDE.

55
00:03:02,644 --> 00:03:06,093
I'M NEW SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE,
MIKE JOHNSON.

56
00:03:06,093 --> 00:03:09,480
>> OH, I SEE.
ALL RIGHT.
WHO?

57
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:12,935
>> MIKE JOHNSON.
I WAS JUST ELECTED SPEAKER OF
THE HOUSE.

58
00:03:12,935 --> 00:03:16,021
>> OH, ALL RIGHT.
AND YOUR NAME IS WHAT?

59
00:03:16,021 --> 00:03:21,096
>> MIKE JOHNSON.
NO ONE'S GOING TO FORGET THAT.

60
00:03:21,096 --> 00:03:24,169
ANYWAY, I'M NOW SECOND IN LINE
TO REPLACE YOU,

61
00:03:24,169 --> 00:03:26,588
SO I'M EXCITED
TO SEE MORE OF THIS WHOLE LADDER
THING.

62
00:03:26,588 --> 00:03:29,011
COOL

63
00:03:29,964 --> 00:03:34,510
>> SO HOW DID YOU END UP
SPEAKER?
>> NO ONE KNOWS.

64
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:38,907
AND THIS IS MY ADULT BLACK SON.

65
00:03:38,907 --> 00:03:40,987
ALSO NAMED MICHAEL.

66
00:03:40,987 --> 00:03:43,415
>> HEY, GUYS.
I'M HIS ADULT BLACK SON.

67
00:03:43,415 --> 00:03:47,231
I'M ONLY 11 YEARS YOUNGER THAN
HIM, AND I'M KIND OF A SECRET.

68
00:03:47,231 --> 00:03:50,342
IT'S NORMAL.
DON'T LOOK INTO THAT AT ALL.

69
00:03:50,342 --> 00:03:53,490
>> WHAT THE HELL'S GOING ON?

70
00:03:53,490 --> 00:03:56,345
HIS NAME IS ALSO MIKE JOHNSON?

71
00:03:56,345 --> 00:03:59,023
>> NO ONE KNOWS HIS LAST NAME.
IT'S NORMAL.

72
00:03:59,023 --> 00:04:02,465
>> YEAH.
HE OFTEN COMPARES OUR SITUATION
TO THE MOVIE THE BLIND SIDE,

73
00:04:02,465 --> 00:04:05,428
AND
EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT STORY HELD
UP GREAT.

74
00:04:05,428 --> 00:04:07,955
ANYWAY, LET'S GO, WHITE DAD.

75
00:04:07,955 --> 00:04:09,857
>> SOUNDS GOOD, ADULT BLACK SON.

76
00:04:09,857 --> 00:04:14,427
AND REMEMBER MY NAME, AMERICA.
JOHN MIKESON.

77
00:04:21,035 --> 00:04:25,684
I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THAT
WAS, BUT, HEY, IT'S A CONFUSING
TIME.

78
00:04:25,684 --> 00:04:28,685
I JUST WISH SOMEONE COULD HELP ME EXPLAIN

79
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:32,079
THE TRUE MEANING OF
HALLOWEEN.

80
00:04:42,891 --> 00:04:45,613
>> MAYBE --

81
00:04:48,011 --> 00:04:50,550
MAYBE --

82
00:04:51,221 --> 00:04:54,469
MAYBE I CAN HELP.

83
00:04:54,688 --> 00:04:57,680
>> I'M SORRY.
WHO ARE YOU?

84
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,566
>> I'M THE SPIRIT OF HALLOWEEN.

85
00:05:00,566 --> 00:05:04,345
THE GHOST OF ALL HALLOWS PAST.

86
00:05:04,345 --> 00:05:09,280
IN SOUTH AMERICA, THEY CALL ME
PAPA PUMPKIN.

87
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,505
I DON'T KNOW, MAYBE.
I NEVER BEEN.

88
00:05:12,505 --> 00:05:16,940
>> HOW DID YOU GET IN HERE?
DID YOU COME IN THROUGH THE
CHIMNEY?

89
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:20,624
>> CLOSE.
THE TOILET.

90
00:05:22,605 --> 00:05:26,701
IT'S THE HALLOWEEN WAY.
IT'S WHAT THE HOLIDAY IS ALL
ABOUT.

91
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:31,496
SURE, THERE'S SPOOKY GOBLINS,
CREEPY CRAWLERS, HOCUS POCUS,

92
00:05:31,496 --> 00:05:34,772
BUT IT'S ABOUT COMRADERY REALLY.

93
00:05:34,772 --> 00:05:39,917
MEET THE NEIGHBORS YOU DON'T
WANT TO SEE AGAIN ON ANY OTHER
DAY.

94
00:05:39,917 --> 00:05:45,559
AFTER ALL, YOU CAN'T SPELL
HALLOWEEN WITHOUT HELLO.

95
00:05:53,076 --> 00:05:55,484
>> ALL RIGHT.

96
00:05:58,623 --> 00:06:03,517
I GUESS I NEVER REALIZED THAT.
IS THAT REALLY HOW YOU SPELL IT?

97
00:06:03,517 --> 00:06:05,785
>> PRETTY MUCH.

98
00:06:05,785 --> 00:06:10,541
NOW, I HAVE A POEM I WOULD LIKE
TO RECITE.

99
00:06:19,568 --> 00:06:21,978
TRICK OR TREAT,

100
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:25,947
SMELL MY FEET,

101
00:06:26,433 --> 00:06:29,700
GIVE ME SOMETHING GOOD TO EAT.

102
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:35,215
>> OH, WOW, OKAY.
YEAH.
THAT'S VERY NICE.

103
00:06:37,466 --> 00:06:39,970
>> I'M NOT DONE.

104
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:43,530
>> IF YOU DON'T, I DON'T CARE,

105
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:46,725
I'LL PULL DOWN YOUR UNDERWEAR.

106
00:06:47,722 --> 00:06:52,250
>> OKAY.
WELL, I THINK THAT'S JUST A
CRIME.

107
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:54,609
>> NOT ON HALLOWEEN.

108
00:06:54,609 --> 00:06:57,410
NOT WHEN PAPA PUMPKIN'S IN TOWN.

109
00:06:57,410 --> 00:07:01,432
NOW, COME ON.
LET ME SMELL THOSE FEET.

110
00:07:01,432 --> 00:07:03,245
FOR AMERICA.

111
00:07:03,245 --> 00:07:08,374
AND LIVE FROM NEW YORK, IT'S
SATURDAY NIGHT.

112
00:09:15,299 --> 00:09:20,362
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, NATE
BARGATZE!

113
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:42,924
>>> THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

114
00:09:42,924 --> 00:09:44,263
IT'S VERY EXCITING.

115
00:09:44,263 --> 00:09:49,106
IT'S CRAZY.
I'M AS -- LOOK, IF YOU'RE AT
HOME, I'M AS SHOCKED AS YOU ARE
THAT I'M HERE.

116
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:52,708
I'VE COME TO THIS BUILDING FOR A LONG TIME,

117
00:09:52,708 --> 00:09:56,659
SO IT'S UNREAL TO BE
HERE AT "SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE."

118
00:09:56,659 --> 00:09:58,481
IT'S CRAZY.
IT'S ALL RIGHT THERE.

119
00:09:58,481 --> 00:10:03,079
MY NAME IS NATE BARGATZE.
I'M FROM TENNESSEE.

120
00:10:03,079 --> 00:10:06,843
I'M ALSO FROM THE 1900s.

121
00:10:06,843 --> 00:10:10,331
AND --

122
00:10:11,162 --> 00:10:15,254
I JUST THINK YOU GOT TO SAY IT.
LIKE THE WORLD IS SO FUTURE NOW.

123
00:10:15,254 --> 00:10:18,894
AND I FEEL IN THE WAY OF IT.

124
00:10:18,894 --> 00:10:21,520
HOTELS, HOTELS ARE FUTURISTIC.

125
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:25,620
YOU TAKE A SHOWER, THE SHOWER'S
ENCLOSED.

126
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:30,527
BUT NOW A LOT OF HOTELS HAVE
HALF A GLASS, AND WATER GETS ON
THE FLOOR.

127
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:34,741
AND THAT'S THE FUTURE.
THAT'S WHAT THE FUTURE --

128
00:10:34,741 --> 00:10:36,244
THAT'S
WHAT THEY WANT.

129
00:10:36,244 --> 00:10:40,483
AND, YOU KNOW, I WOULD LIKE A
WHOLE --

130
00:10:40,483 --> 00:10:43,243
THEY DO HALF A GLASS
BECAUSE I'M STILL ALIVE, SO
THEY'RE LIKE --

131
00:10:43,243 --> 00:10:45,770
THEY DON'T WANT
TO HEAR ME GOING WHERE'S THE
GLASS AT,

132
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:47,650
SO THEY DO HALF A
GLASS.

133
00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:51,416
IN THE FUTURE, THE FLOOR IS
ALWAYS WET, EVERY FLOOR.

134
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:58,134
I MEAN, I THINK -- I'M 44.
MY DAUGHTER'S 11.

135
00:10:58,134 --> 00:11:00,864
WHEN SHE'S MY AGE, IT'LL BE
2057.

136
00:11:00,864 --> 00:11:03,840
I DON'T EVEN BELIEVE THAT'S A
REAL YEAR.

137
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:08,546
MY MOVIES DIDN'T GO THAT HIGH IN
FAKE YEARS.

138
00:11:08,546 --> 00:11:12,194
HOW AM I GOING TO TALK TO
SOMEONE FROM 2057?

139
00:11:12,194 --> 00:11:15,364
I HAVE MORE IN COMMON WITH A
PILGRIM.

140
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:26,277
I SAW TOO MUCH OLD-TIMEY STUFF.
I'M PRE-INTERNET.

141
00:11:26,277 --> 00:11:30,367
WE GO TO A COUNTY FAIR, WILSON
COUNTY FAIR --

142
00:11:30,367 --> 00:11:32,432
THIS IS IN
TENNESSEE IF YOU'RE WONDERING,

143
00:11:32,432 --> 00:11:35,311
AND WE WOULD GO THERE -- FAIRS,
I DON'T KNOW HOW THEY'RE STILL
OPEN.

144
00:11:35,311 --> 00:11:37,804
I DON'T THINK THE GOVERNMENT
KNOWS ABOUT THEM.

145
00:11:37,804 --> 00:11:43,262
WE RIDE THESE RIDES THAT WERE ON
THE INTERSTATE AN HOUR AGO.

146
00:11:48,066 --> 00:11:51,457
SO, MY DAD IS A MAGICIAN IF YOU DON'T KNOW,

147
00:11:51,457 --> 00:11:54,122
AND WE WOULD GO
WATCH HIM PERFORM.

148
00:11:54,122 --> 00:11:57,835
THIS IS THE '80s.
SO WE GO WATCH HIM, MY DAD'S
DOING MAGIC.

149
00:11:57,835 --> 00:12:00,229
RIGHT NEXT TO HIM, THEY HAD
DONKEYS

150
00:12:00,229 --> 00:12:03,869
JUMPING OFF A HIGH DIVE
INTO A POOL.

151
00:12:04,859 --> 00:12:08,317
SO PRETTY TOUGH TO KEEP PEOPLE'S
ATTENTION

152
00:12:08,317 --> 00:12:11,982
WHEN MY DAD IS LIKE,
IS THIS YOUR CARD?

153
00:12:11,982 --> 00:12:16,619
AND EVERYBODY'S LIKE, HOLD ON,
THIS DONKEY'S ABOUT TO JUMP OFF
THIS HIGH DIVE.

154
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:23,174
THAT'S SOMETHING YOU DON'T THINK
YOU WANT TO SEE UNTIL IT'S UP
THERE.

155
00:12:26,379 --> 00:12:30,377
I USUALLY -- LOOK, I USE THE
WORD JUMP VERY LOOSELY.

156
00:12:30,733 --> 00:12:35,594
YEAH.
THESE DONKEYS ARE FALLING OFF
THIS HIGH DIVE.

157
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:39,908
BUT CAN'T PUT THAT ON THE SIGN.
YOU KNOW.

158
00:12:40,077 --> 00:12:44,438
WANT TO WATCH A DONKEY FALL OFF
A HIGH DIVE?
LIKE, NO.

159
00:12:44,438 --> 00:12:47,904
WHAT IF HE JUMPED?
WELL, AT LEAST HE'S INTO IT.

160
00:12:51,541 --> 00:12:57,498
JUST SO YOU KNOW, PETA SHUT THAT
DOWN.

161
00:12:57,498 --> 00:13:01,002
THAT WAS ONE EVERYBODY WAS LIKE,
WE GET THAT ONE.

162
00:13:04,256 --> 00:13:07,699
THERE WAS ANOTHER ONE THEY HAD
TO SHUT DOWN,

163
00:13:07,699 --> 00:13:10,859
SO THIS IS ALSO IN
THE '80s, PRE-INTERNET.

164
00:13:10,859 --> 00:13:12,731
YOU COULD FIGHT AN ORANGUTAN.

165
00:13:12,731 --> 00:13:14,941
YOU COULD FIST FIGHT AN
ORANGUTAN.

166
00:13:14,941 --> 00:13:17,546
THIS WAS OFFERED.

167
00:13:17,546 --> 00:13:21,717
WE DIDN'T HAVE A LOT GOING ON.
THIS IS WHAT WE HAD TO DO.

168
00:13:21,717 --> 00:13:24,755
SO AN ORANGUTAN WOULD BE IN A
BOXING RING WITH BOXING GLOVES ON,

169
00:13:24,755 --> 00:13:26,063
AND IT WOULD STAND LIKE THIS,

170
00:13:26,063 --> 00:13:29,934
AND A GUY WOULD PAY $5 --
IT WASN'T FOR FREE.

171
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:32,823
YOU WOULD PAY, AND YOU WOULD GO IN THERE

172
00:13:32,823 --> 00:13:35,981
AND THIS ORANGUTAN
WOULD JUST KNOCK THIS DUDE OUT

173
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:40,732
BECAUSE WE DIDN'T HAVE THE
INTERNET TO LOOK UP HOW STRONG
IS AN ORANGUTAN, SO --

174
00:13:47,278 --> 00:13:49,949
IT WAS ALL WORD OF MOUTH BACK
THEN.

175
00:13:49,949 --> 00:13:53,472
YOU HAD TO MEET A GUY THAT JUST
FOUGHT AN ORANGUTAN.

176
00:13:53,472 --> 00:13:56,397
AND YOU'RE LIKE, ARE THEY
STRONG?
YEAH, DUDE.

177
00:13:56,397 --> 00:14:01,339
BUT THE ARMS ARE SKINNY.
I KNOW.
THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT AS WELL.

178
00:14:01,339 --> 00:14:04,773
THAT STRENGTH COMES FROM
SOMEWHERE.

179
00:14:06,274 --> 00:14:07,868
LOOK, YOU THINK I'M OLD.

180
00:14:07,868 --> 00:14:11,790
THERE'S PEOPLE OLDER THAN ME
STILL AROUND.

181
00:14:12,384 --> 00:14:14,357
THAT'S CRAZY.
IT'S CRAZY.

182
00:14:14,357 --> 00:14:16,797
WALKING AROUND, PEOPLE FROM THE
'30s.

183
00:14:16,797 --> 00:14:20,149
MY GREAT AUNT HELEN, FROM THE
'30s, SHE'S DEAF.

184
00:14:20,149 --> 00:14:22,929
THEY DIDN'T KNOW SHE WAS DEAF
UNTIL SHE WAS 9 YEARS OLD.

185
00:14:22,929 --> 00:14:24,969
THAT'S HOW LONG IT TOOK FOR THEM TO FIGURE --

186
00:14:24,969 --> 00:14:28,409
DEAF IS ONE OF THE
EASIER ONES TO FIGURE OUT.

187
00:14:29,321 --> 00:14:31,622
AND THE DOCTORS WERE BAFFLED,

188
00:14:31,622 --> 00:14:35,334
AS THEY SMOKED IN HER FACE.

189
00:14:36,527 --> 00:14:39,224
AND THEY WERE LIKE, I DON'T
KNOW.

190
00:14:39,224 --> 00:14:41,987
SHE'S RUDE.
I'LL TELL YOU THAT.

191
00:14:47,412 --> 00:14:49,464
MY MOM -- MY PARENTS ARE GETTING OLDER,

192
00:14:49,464 --> 00:14:52,201
SO WE HAD MY MOM GO PICK
UP OUR DAUGHTER RECENTLY AT A
FRIEND'S HOUSE.

193
00:14:52,201 --> 00:14:56,234
I TEXTED HER THE ADDRESS.
SHE WENT TO THE WRONG HOUSE.

194
00:14:56,234 --> 00:14:59,195
SHE KNOCKED ON THE DOOR, AND
ANOTHER GRANDMOTHER ANSWERED.

195
00:14:59,195 --> 00:15:01,553
THIS IS NOT GOOD.

196
00:15:01,553 --> 00:15:05,411
THIS IS LIKE TWO DOGS SEEING
EACH OTHER THROUGH A FENCE.

197
00:15:06,972 --> 00:15:10,735
THEY'RE GONNA BE THERE FOR A
WHILE, YOU KNOW?

198
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:14,419
SO MY MOM, SHE KNOCKED ON THE
DOOR.

199
00:15:14,419 --> 00:15:16,707
ANOTHER

200
00:15:16,707 --> 00:15:18,886
MY MOM GOES, IS MY GRANDDAUGHTER
IN THERE,

201
00:15:18,886 --> 00:15:21,878
AND THAT LADY GOES, I
HAVE THREE GRANDSONS.

202
00:15:21,878 --> 00:15:24,871
SO, NO SOLUTION.

203
00:15:26,105 --> 00:15:31,462
JUST TWO GRANDMOTHERS JUST, DO
YOU HAVE STUFF?
I HAVE STUFF TOO.

204
00:15:31,966 --> 00:15:36,229
THEY TALKED FOR 30 MINUTES.
IT'S A WRONG DOOR.

205
00:15:36,229 --> 00:15:40,496
I HAD TO GO GET MY DAUGHTER THEN
FIND MY MOM.

206
00:15:44,154 --> 00:15:48,854
MY DAD TOO.
MY DAD HAS SURGERY EIGHT TIMES A
YEAR PROBABLY.

207
00:15:48,854 --> 00:15:52,893
AND HE LOVES IT.
HE LOVES IT.

208
00:15:55,971 --> 00:16:01,004
HE HAD SURGERY BECAUSE HE WAS
ADDICTED TO AFRIN, THE NOSE
SPRAY.

209
00:16:01,004 --> 00:16:04,623
LOOK, I HAVE BEEN ADDICTED TO
AFRIN THE NOSE SPRAY.

210
00:16:04,623 --> 00:16:08,384
IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS, I
WOULD HONESTLY TELL YOU NOT TO
GET INVOLVED.

211
00:16:08,987 --> 00:16:12,520
IT'S ONE OF THE BEST THINGS I'VE
EVER BEEN A PART OF.

212
00:16:13,313 --> 00:16:16,027
SOLVES EVERYTHING IMMEDIATELY.

213
00:16:16,027 --> 00:16:19,541
WHEN I WAS ON IT TOO, MY WIFE
WAS -- SHE WOULD BE LIKE WHAT'S
THAT NOISE?

214
00:16:19,541 --> 00:16:21,170
SHE WOULD HEAR ONE PUFF, WHAT'S
THAT?

215
00:16:21,170 --> 00:16:23,433
I GO, I AIN'T GOING TO LIVE LIKE
THIS.

216
00:16:23,433 --> 00:16:27,798
I DIDN'T WORK THIS HARD NOT TO
DO AFRIN IN MY OWN HOME.

217
00:16:30,893 --> 00:16:34,137
SO MY DAD GOES TO THE DOCTOR,

218
00:16:34,137 --> 00:16:37,628
AND THEY WERE LIKE, DO YOU USE
AFRIN, AND HE GOES, NO.

219
00:16:37,628 --> 00:16:42,406
AND THE DOCTOR WAS LIKE, LIKE I
CAN SEE THAT YOU USE IT.
I WAS JUST SAYING THAT.

220
00:16:43,915 --> 00:16:47,658
AND HE GOES, HOW LONG HAVE YOU
BEEN USING IT, AND MY DAD SAID FIVE YEARS,

221
00:16:47,658 --> 00:16:48,788
WHICH IS A LIE.

222
00:16:48,788 --> 00:16:51,995
BUT MY MOM WAS THERE, AND SHE
GOES, HOW ABOUT 45 YEARS.

223
00:16:51,995 --> 00:16:55,176
THAT'S HOW LONG HE'S USED IT.

224
00:16:55,176 --> 00:16:58,916
THE BACK OF THE BOX SAYS NO MORE
THAN THREE DAYS.

225
00:17:01,146 --> 00:17:06,444
THERE'S NOT A MEDICINE ON EARTH
THAT TELLS YOU TO GIVE IT A GOOD
45-YEAR RUN.

226
00:17:09,582 --> 00:17:12,362
THAT'S WHY I GET NERVOUS AS I
GET OLDER

227
00:17:12,362 --> 00:17:14,809
BECAUSE I AM ALREADY
NOT SMART.

228
00:17:14,809 --> 00:17:17,935
AND I'M IN MY PRIME RIGHT NOW.

229
00:17:17,935 --> 00:17:21,620
I DON'T READ ANY BOOKS.
I DON'T DO IT.

230
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:25,224
AND I THINK THAT MATTERS.
I DO THINK THAT MATTERS.

231
00:17:25,224 --> 00:17:28,813
READING, I BELIEVE, IS THE KEY
TO SMART.
THAT'S WHAT I'VE ALWAYS SAID.

232
00:17:28,813 --> 00:17:35,548
AND I DON'T DO IT BECAUSE EVERY
BOOK IS JUST THE MOST WORDS.

233
00:17:36,196 --> 00:17:38,190
IT DOESN'T LET UP.

234
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:41,503
I MEAN, EVERY PAGE IS MORE WORDS --

235
00:17:41,503 --> 00:17:43,985
IT'S LIKE, WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

236
00:17:43,985 --> 00:17:46,277
PUT SOME BLANK PAGES IN THERE.

237
00:17:46,277 --> 00:17:50,028
LET ME GET MY HEAD ABOVE WATER
FOR TWO SECONDS.

238
00:17:56,192 --> 00:18:00,040
THANK YOU.

239
00:18:02,188 --> 00:18:06,980
I'M LIKE, I WANT TO LEARN MORE
ABOUT HISTORY BECAUSE I DON'T
KNOW ANYTHING.

240
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:09,227
SO I'M TRYING TO FIGURE IT OUT.

241
00:18:09,227 --> 00:18:12,705
AND I CAN TELL I DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT HISTORY BECAUSE
EVERY HISTORY MOVIE I WATCH,

242
00:18:12,705 --> 00:18:14,685
I WATCH ON THE EDGE OF MY SEAT

243
00:18:14,685 --> 00:18:19,740
JUST LIKE WHAT IS GOING TO
HAPPEN.
I DON'T KNOW.

244
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:24,408
I WATCHED THE MOVIE PEARL
HARBOR, AND I WAS AS SURPRISED
AS THEY WERE.

245
00:18:24,408 --> 00:18:26,704
JUST CRAZY.

246
00:18:26,704 --> 00:18:30,470
ALL RIGHT.
WE'VE GOT A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU
TONIGHT!

247
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:32,291
FOO FIGHTERS ARE HERE,

00:18:32,291 --> 00:18:35,400

00:19:02,587 --> 00:19:06,139
>> CHEFS, IT'S BEEN AN EMOTIONAL
WEEK HERE AT CHEF SHOWDOWN.

252
00:19:06,139 --> 00:19:08,734
WE VISITED THE OLDEST BLACK
CHURCH IN GEORGIA

253
00:19:08,734 --> 00:19:11,251
WHERE WE
LEARNED ABOUT THE ORIGINS OF SOUL FOOD

254
00:19:11,251 --> 00:19:13,720
IN PREPARATION FOR OUR
SOUL FOOD CHALLENGE.

255
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,892
WHAT WAS THAT EXPERIENCE LIKE
FOR YOU BOTH?

256
00:19:15,892 --> 00:19:19,951
>> AMAZING.
I FELT CONNECTED TO MY CULTURE,
TO MY ROOTS.

257
00:19:19,951 --> 00:19:21,667
IT WAS REALLY AN HONOR.

258
00:19:21,667 --> 00:19:23,979
>> AND YOU, DOUGIE?

259
00:19:23,979 --> 00:19:28,429
>> HECK YEAH.
THUMBS UP.
YOU KNOW, IT WAS GREAT.

260
00:19:28,429 --> 00:19:33,645
>> NOW FOR THE CHALLENGE, YOU

SOUL FOOD FEAST FOR OUR GUEST
JUDGES.

261
00:19:33,645 --> 00:19:37,972

00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:48,276
CHEFS, THE JUDGES TASTED YOUR
PLATES BLIND, AND THEY'RE READY

265
00:19:48,276 --> 00:19:51,586
JUDGES, WHAT DID YOU THINK OF
PLATE NUMBER ONE?

266
00:19:51,586 --> 00:19:56,140
>> WELL, PLATE NUMBER ONE WAS
PERFECT.
OKAY?

267
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:57,853
I COULD FEEL THE SOUL.

268
00:19:57,853 --> 00:20:01,771
THE BRISKET, JOHN,
THE COLLARDS.

269
00:20:01,771 --> 00:20:04,053
THIS PLATE RIGHT HERE IS THE
CULTURE.

270
00:20:04,053 --> 00:20:07,127
>> YES, I AGREE.
WE DON'T KNOW WHO COOKED WHAT,

271
00:20:07,127 --> 00:20:11,361
BUT WHOEVER COOKED PLATE ONE
KNEW EXACTLY WHAT SHE WAS DOING.

272
00:20:11,361 --> 00:20:12,809
>> YES.

273
00:20:12,809 --> 00:20:15,287
>> AND WHAT ABOUT PLATE TWO?

274
00:20:15,287 --> 00:20:20,401
>> PLATE TWO FRANKLY PISSED ME
OFF.

275
00:20:20,401 --> 00:20:23,612
I MEAN, WHAT IS THIS?
OKRA FOAM,

276
00:20:23,612 --> 00:20:26,936
CORNBREAD ICE CREAM,
HUSH PUPPY JELLY?

277
00:20:26,936 --> 00:20:28,596
THIS AIN'T NO SOUL FOOD.

278
00:20:28,596 --> 00:20:31,949
>> THIS PLATE HAS NO SOUL AND NO
FOOD.

279
00:20:31,949 --> 00:20:33,788
>> YOU GOT THAT RIGHT.

280
00:20:33,788 --> 00:20:37,658
LOOK HERE, MY MAN, RESPECT FOR

FOOD BEFORE?

289

I'M SORRY.

290
00:21:12,365 --> 00:21:15,925
>> BUT YOU MUST HAVE GROWN UP
AROUND IT, RIGHT?

291
00:21:15,925 --> 00:21:19,267
I MEAN, WHERE ARE YOU FROM?
>> RHODE ISLAND.

292
00:21:19,267 --> 00:21:22,297

294
00:21:24,964 --> 00:21:27,710
YOUR PARENTS THE BLACK SOMEHOW.

295
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:31,095
>> NO.
MY PARENTS ARE WHITE.
I'M SORRY.

296
00:21:31,095 --> 00:21:32,892

SOMETHING.

>> I WANT TO KILL YOU AND YOUR
WHOLE FAMILY.

374
00:26:10,637 --> 00:26:14,135
>> WE CORNERED THE MARKET ON
CHRISTMAS, WHY NOT HALLOWEEN?

375
00:26:14,135 --> 00:26:18,720
BECAUSE THE ONLY THING FEMALE
VIEWERS LIKE MORE THAN ROMANCE

I SHOULD HAVE TOLD YOU.

385
00:26:47,333 --> 00:26:50,598

TO KILL YOU ANYMORE.
>> DON'T SAY THAT.

386
00:26:50,598 --> 00:26:55,002
>> JUST GO BACK TO NEW YORK.
THERE'S PLENTY OF PEOPLE TO KILL
YOU THERE.

387
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:57,636
>> MARK!

388

00:28:07,506 --> 00:28:11,830
>> SIT, PLEASE.
WE NEED YOUR STRENGTH FOR THE
FIGHT AHEAD.

406
00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:14,996
WE FIGHT FOR A COUNTRY OF OUR OWN,

407
00:28:14,996 --> 00:28:18,057
 A NEW NATION WHERE WE
CHOOSE OUR OWN LAWS.

408
00:28:18,057 --> 00:28:19,731
>> HERE, HERE.

409
00:28:19,731 --> 00:28:22,799
>> CHOOSE OUR OWN LEADERS.
>> YES, SIR!

410
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:26,883
>> AND CHOOSE OUR OWN SYSTEMS OF
WEIGHTS AND MEASURES.

411
00:28:30,846 --> 00:28:34,571
>> WEIGHTS AND MEASURES, SIR?
>> YES.

412
00:28:34,571 --> 00:28:39,615
YES, I DREAM OF THAT ONE DAY OUR
PROUD NATION 

413
00:28:39,615 --> 00:28:44,855
WILL MEASURE
WEIGHTS IN POUNDS AND THAT 2,000
POUNDS SHALL BE CALLED A TON.

414
00:28:45,439 --> 00:28:48,471
>> AND WHAT WILL 1,000 POUNDS BE
CALLED, SIR?

415
00:28:48,471 --> 00:28:50,610
>> NOTHING.

416
00:28:51,886 --> 00:28:54,237
BECAUSE WE WILL HAVE NO WORD FOR
THAT.

417
00:28:54,237 --> 00:28:58,834
>> SEEMS LIKE WE SHOULD HAVE A
WORD FOR 1,000 POUNDS, SIR.

418
00:28:58,834 --> 00:29:01,644
>> AND YET, WE WON'T.

419
00:29:02,222 --> 00:29:05,002
BECAUSE WE ARE FREE MEN.

420
00:29:05,002 --> 00:29:09,503
AND WE WILL BE FREE TO MEASURE
LIQUIDS IN LITERS AND MILLILITERS, 

421
00:29:09,503 --> 00:29:13,956
BUT NOT ALL
LIQUIDS.
ONLY SODA, WINE, AND ALCOHOL.

422
00:29:13,956 --> 00:29:16,938
>> ONLY THOSE, SIR?
>> YES.

423
00:29:16,938 --> 00:29:21,206
BECAUSE FOR MILK AND PAINT, WE
WILL USE GALLONS, PINTS, AND
QUARTS GOD WILLING.

424
00:29:21,206 --> 00:29:25,715
>> HOW MANY LITERS ARE IN A
GALLON, SIR?

425
00:29:25,715 --> 00:29:28,004
>> NOBODY KNOWS.

426
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:35,087
>> AND, SIR, IN THIS NEW COUNTRY, 

427
00:29:35,087 --> 00:29:38,846
WHAT PLANS ARE THERE
FOR MEN OF COLOR SUCH AS I?

428
00:29:39,123 --> 00:29:43,699
>> DISTANCE WILL BE MEASURED IN
INCHES, FEET, YARD, AND MILE.

429
00:29:44,613 --> 00:29:47,241
SO 12 INCHES TO A FOOT.

430
00:29:47,241 --> 00:29:49,187
>> 12 FEET TO A YARD.

431
00:29:49,187 --> 00:29:53,748
>> IF IT WERE ONLY SO SIMPLE.
3 FEET TO A YARD.

432
00:29:53,748 --> 00:29:58,209
>> AND HOW MANY YARDS TO A MILE?
>> NOBODY KNOWS.

433
00:29:59,048 --> 00:30:03,298
>> OKAY.
WELL, HOW MANY FEET TO A MILE?

434
00:30:03,298 --> 00:30:07,325
>> 5,280, OF COURSE.

435
00:30:09,165 --> 00:30:13,221
IT'S A SIMPLE NUMBER THAT
EVERYONE WILL REMEMBER.

436
00:30:13,221 --> 00:30:17,451
>> I MUST CONFESS, IT FEELS A
LITTLE COMPLICATED, SIR.

437
00:30:17,451 --> 00:30:20,416
WHY NOT USE METERS AND
KILOMETERS.

438
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:22,368
>> WE WILL, SOLDIER.

439
00:30:22,368 --> 00:30:26,839
BUT ONLY IN CERTAIN UNPOPULAR
SPORTS LIKE TRACK AND SWIMMING.

440
00:30:26,839 --> 00:30:31,414
FOR POPULAR SPORTS LIKE
FOOTBALL, WE WILL USE YARDS.

441
00:30:31,414 --> 00:30:33,431
>> FOOTBALL, SIR?

442
00:30:33,431 --> 00:30:37,500
>> YES.
IT'S A SPORT WHERE YOU THROW A
BALL WITH YOUR HANDS.

443
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:41,500
>> SO IN FOOTBALL, THERE IS NO
KICKING?

444
00:30:41,542 --> 00:30:52,718
>> THERE'S A LITTLE KICKING.
YOU KICK THE BALL TO GET POINTS.

445
00:30:52,718 --> 00:30:57,865
>> HOW MANY POINTS, SIR?
>> SOMETIMES ONE AND SOMETIMES
THREE.

446
00:30:58,482 --> 00:31:01,277
>> I'M VERY CONFUSED, SIR.

447

NATION, WE WILL HAVE RULERS WITH
TWO SETS OF NUMBERS, 

448
00:31:07,114 --> 00:31:10,877
INCHES ON
ONE SIDE, CENTIMETERS ON THE
OTHER.

449
00:31:10,877 --> 00:31:13,418
>> SO WE CAN SEE WHERE THEY LINE
UP?

LINE UP, AND THEY NEVER WILL.

>> LIBERTY, SON.
LIBERTY.

THEM?

>> YOU ASKED ABOUT THE
TEMPERATURE.
>> I DID NOT.

UNRELATED SCALES OF TEMPERATURE.

455
00:31:39,359 --> 00:31:43,662
ONE OF THEM WILL MAKE SENSE TO
THE ENTIRE WORLD, AND THE OTHER
WILL BE SUPER RANDOM.

456
00:31:43,662 --> 00:31:47,124
OUR GREAT NATION WILL USE THE
RANDOM ONE.

457
00:31:47,856 --> 00:31:51,968
>> WHAT IS THE SCALE CALLED,
SIR?
>> FAHRENHEIT.

458
00:31:51,968 --> 00:31:55,662
>> SPELL THAT FOR ME.
>> IMPOSSIBLE.

459
00:31:57,590 --> 00:32:00,468
BUT ONE DAY, IF WE ARE BRAVE, WE
WILL GET RID OF THE U

460

 IN A LOT
OF BRITISH WORDS LIKE COLOR AND
ARMOR.

BRITISH U IN THE WORD GLAMOUR.

HODA.

601
00:38:23,935 --> 00:38:24,668
>> THE WIG IS FAKE, BUT THE WINE

602
00:38:24,670 --> 00:38:31,307
THE REAL!

603
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:31,908
>> WAIT.

604
00:38:31,910 --> 00:38:33,910
WHY IS THAT ONE OKAY?

605
00:38:33,912 --> 00:38:35,145
ISN'T SHE ON TV?

606
00:38:35,147 --> 00:38:36,980
>> WELL, DAYTIME AND REALITY TV

607
00:38:36,982 --> 00:38:39,549
ARE OKAY, WHICH MEANS THAT

608
00:38:39,551 --> 00:38:41,017
YOU'RE DRESSED FINE, BECAUSE

609
00:38:41,019 --> 00:38:42,852
YOU'RE DRESSED AS ONE OF THE

610
00:38:42,854 --> 00:38:45,021
PERVERTS FROM TO CATCH A

611
00:38:45,023 --> 00:38:45,388
PREDATOR.

612
00:38:45,390 --> 00:38:47,357
>> THIS IS JUST MY REGULAR

613
00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:47,824
OUTFIT.

614
00:38:47,826 --> 00:38:49,392
>> WHAT IF PEOPLE ALREADY BOUGHT

615
00:38:49,394 --> 00:38:53,096
A COSTUME BEFORE THE STRIKE?

616
00:38:53,098 --> 00:38:53,596
>> GOOD QUESTION.

617
00:38:53,598 --> 00:38:55,699
WITH SMALL ADJUSTMENTS, MANY

618
00:38:55,701 --> 00:38:57,767
COSTUMES CAN BE STRIKE FRIENDLY.

619
00:38:57,769 --> 00:39:00,003
FOR EXAMPLE, SAY YOU'RE DRESSED

620
00:39:00,005 --> 00:39:01,938
AS WOLVERINE.

621
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:04,441
JUST DROP THE CLAWS, AND

622
00:39:04,443 --> 00:39:05,375
WAH-LAH, NOW YOU'RE ANY GAY GUY

623
00:39:05,377 --> 00:39:10,580
OVER 50.

624
00:39:10,582 --> 00:39:16,119
>> THANKS, FRANNY.

625
00:39:16,121 --> 00:39:16,619
>> YOU'RE WELCOME.

626
00:39:16,621 --> 00:39:18,321
OR SAY YOU'RE DRESSED AS MARIO.

627
00:39:18,323 --> 00:39:20,957
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS PUT ON A

628
00:39:20,959 --> 00:39:22,759
CHEF'S HAT, AND NOW YOU'RE THE

629
00:39:22,761 --> 00:39:24,594
GUY FROM THE PIZZA BOX.

630
00:39:24,596 --> 00:39:28,131
>> IT'S A-ME, THE GUY FROM THE

631
00:39:28,133 --> 00:39:30,433
PIZZA BOX.

632
00:39:30,435 --> 00:39:32,569
>> MS. DRESCHER, HOW CAN I HOPE

633
00:39:32,571 --> 00:39:34,404
TO UNDERSTAND SOMETHING SO

634
00:39:34,406 --> 00:39:34,804
COMPLICATED?

635
00:39:34,806 --> 00:39:35,672
I'M JUST A LITTLE KID.

636
00:39:35,674 --> 00:39:38,274
>> WELL, HODA, I THINK I CAN

637
00:39:38,276 --> 00:39:39,843
EXPLAIN IN TERMS EVEN A DRUNK

638
00:39:39,845 --> 00:39:45,181
CHILD CAN UNDERSTAND.

639
00:39:45,183 --> 00:39:47,417
NEGOTIATING WITH THE STUDIOS IS

640
00:39:47,419 --> 00:39:48,885
A LOT LIKE TRICK OR TREATING.

641
00:39:48,887 --> 00:39:51,087
YOU KNOW HOW YOU GO TO THE

642
00:39:51,089 --> 00:39:52,989
BIGGEST HOUSE ON THE BLOCK, AND

643
00:39:52,991 --> 00:39:54,991
ALL THE LIGHTS ARE OFF, AND

644
00:39:54,993 --> 00:39:57,393
THEY'RE PRETENDING THEY'RE NOT

645
00:39:57,395 --> 00:39:57,694
HOME?

646
00:39:57,696 --> 00:39:59,996
BUT YOU CAN SEE THEM THROUGH THE

647
00:39:59,998 --> 00:40:03,099
WINDOW EATING KITKAT BARS,

648
00:40:03,101 --> 00:40:06,402
DOZENS OF KITKAT BARS, BILLIONS

649
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:09,506
OF KITKAT BARS, RECORD NUMBERS

650
00:40:09,508 --> 00:40:13,576
OF KITKAT BARS, ALL US ACTORS

651
00:40:13,578 --> 00:40:15,311
ARE SAYING IS BREAK ME OFF A

652
00:40:15,313 --> 00:40:18,982
PIECE OF THAT KITKAT BAR.

653
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:23,987
>> WOW.

654
00:40:23,989 --> 00:40:25,688
WHEN YOU PUT IT LIKE THAT, IT

655
00:40:25,690 --> 00:40:27,390
MAKES A LOT OF SENSE.

656
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:28,291
>> THANK YOU.

657
00:40:28,293 --> 00:40:31,528
LOVE YOUR COSTUME, BY THE WAY.

658
00:40:31,530 --> 00:40:40,270
KEVIN BACON'S PEDEPHILE

CHARACTER.

00:40:40,672 --> 00:40:41,571
>> I'M NOT WALTER.

661
00:40:41,573 --> 00:40:43,573

>> NOPE, THE NANNY.

669
00:40:57,489 --> 00:41:01,624

THANK YOU.
GOOD EVENING, EVERYONE.

I'M MICHAEL CHE.
>> I'M COLIN JOST.

725
00:46:34,333 --> 00:46:38,309
WELL, AFTER WEEKS OF STRUGGLING
TO ELECT A NEW SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE,

726
00:46:38,309 --> 00:46:42,473
REPUBLICANS GAVE UP AND
JUST GENERATED ONE WITH AI.

727
00:46:42,473 --> 00:46:46,078
THERE'S NO WAY MIKE JOHNSON IS A
REAL PERSON.

728
00:46:46,078 --> 00:46:48,324
HE'S SUPPOSED TO BE A
CONSERVATIVE REPUBLICAN,

729
00:46:48,324 --> 00:46:52,281
YET HE
LOOKS LIKE EVERY MSNBC HOST
COMBINED.

730
00:46:52,996 --> 00:46:56,956
I FEEL LIKE THE WAY MIKE JOHNSON
GOT ELECTED IS AFTER WEEKS OF VOTING,

731
00:46:56,956 --> 00:47:00,257
REPUBLICANS ARE BORED AND ALL WROTE IN
THE SAME FAKE NAME,

732
00:47:00,257 --> 00:47:03,622
AND THEN
THEY WERE LIKE, WAIT, THAT'S A
REAL GUY?

733
00:47:03,809 --> 00:47:07,290
>> SPEAKER MIKE JOHNSON HAS ALSO
BEEN CALLED HOMOPHOBIC

734
00:47:07,290 --> 00:47:10,414
FOR
SUPPORTING ANTI-LBGTQ LEGISLATION

735
00:47:10,414 --> 00:47:13,246
AND SAYING IT'S
BIZARRE AND DEVIANT,

736
00:47:13,246 --> 00:47:17,263
WHICH ARE
TWO FANTASTIC GAY CLUBS ON THE
WEST SIDE.

737
00:47:21,206 --> 00:47:26,433
>> FORMER PRESIDENT AND CURRENT COURTROOM SKETCH
MODEL DONALD TRUMP

738
00:47:29,336 --> 00:47:33,297
TESTIFIED ON
THE STAND FOR THE FIRST TIME IN
OVER TEN YEARS,

739
00:47:33,297 --> 00:47:38,312
AND IT'S FUN
THAT NOBODY IS 100% SURE WHICH
TRIAL THIS SKETCH IS FROM.

740
00:47:38,312 --> 00:47:41,419
TURNS OUT IT WAS FROM HIS CIVIL
FRAUD TRIAL

741
00:47:41,419 --> 00:47:44,200
WHERE MICHAEL COHEN
TESTIFIED AGAINST DONALD TRUMP

742
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:46,082
WHILE TRUMP WAS IN THE
COURTROOM.

743
00:47:46,082 --> 00:47:48,483
AND I BELIEVE WE HAVE VIDEO.

744
00:47:54,815 --> 00:47:59,196
>> MICHAEL COHEN TESTIFIED THAT
DONALD TRUMP'S THREE OLDEST CHILDREN

745
00:47:59,196 --> 00:48:04,027
WERE INVOLVED IN
PUTTING TOGETHER FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS FOR HIS COMPANY.

IVANKA WROTE THE SUMMARIES, DON
JR. PUT TOGETHER THE NUMBERS

AND ERIC
LICKED THE ENVELOPE.

748

NOT 4 BUT 6

MELANIA

751
00:48:26,636 --> 00:48:31,472
>> AND EARLIER TODAY, MIKE PENCE
OFFICIALLY ENDED HIS
PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN.

752
00:48:31,472 --> 00:48:34,088
HE MADE THE DECISION AFTER HE
CONSULTED WITH GOD,

753
00:48:34,088 --> 00:48:38,299
AND GOD
SAID, DUDE, YOU'RE EMBARRASSING
BOTH OF US.

754
00:48:39,185 --> 00:48:42,003
>> A NEW POLL SHOWS PRESIDENT
BIDEN AND DONALD TRUMP

755
00:48:42,003 --> 00:48:45,389
ARE TIED
IN A HYPOTHETICAL 2024 REMATCH,

756
00:48:45,389 --> 00:48:49,057
THOUGH THEY'RE BOTH RUNNING 50
POINTS BEHIND KILL ME.

00:55:03,028 --> 00:55:08,254
>> THE WORLD'S OLDEST DOG EVER
HAS DIED AT THE AGE OF 31.

924
00:55:08,254 --> 00:55:11,334
AND SOME EXPERTS BELIEVE IT
COULD HAVE LIVED EVEN LONGER

925
00:55:11,334 --> 00:55:15,026
IF
I HAD LOOKED BEFORE BACKING OUT
OF THE DRIVEWAY.

926
00:55:18,203 --> 00:55:22,822
AND A NEW REPORT FINDS THAT
VERMONT IS THE SAFEST STATE IN
AMERICA.

927
00:55:22,822 --> 00:55:25,999
FOR LIKE, YOU KNOW, US.

928
00:55:29,653 --> 00:55:33,305
>> NEW RESEARCH SUGGESTS THAT VIAGRA

929
00:55:33,305 --> 00:55:37,657
CAN HELP LOWER A MAN'S
CHANCES OF DEVELOPING ALZHEIMER'S BY 50%

930
00:55:37,657 --> 00:55:42,150
THANKS TO EFFECT
POSTNUT CLARITY.

931
00:55:44,411 --> 00:55:48,599
>> WHITE CASTLE HAS REPLACED FRY
COOKS WITH ROBOTS.

932
00:55:48,599 --> 00:55:52,055
BUT ONE THING THEY CAN'T REPLACE

933
00:55:52,055 --> 00:55:55,650
IS JUMPING OVER THE COUNTER TO
CHOKE A CUSTOMER.

934
00:55:56,434 --> 00:56:00,865
>> OLIVE OIL PRICES HAVE DOUBLED
EXTRENE WEATHER

935
00:56:00,865 --> 00:56:06,373
WHICH SADLY HAS FORCED MANY
NEW JERSEY RESIDENTS TO BATHE IN
WATER.

936
00:56:08,484 --> 00:56:13,140
FOR

937
00:56:40,330 --> 00:56:44,833
CLEAR SKIES AHEAD.

938
00:56:44,835 --> 00:56:46,902
WE SHOULD BE LANDING IN NEWARK

939
00:56:46,904 --> 00:56:47,402
IN THREE HOURS.

940
00:56:47,404 --> 00:56:48,770
>> YOU OKAY, BABE?

941
00:56:48,772 --> 00:56:50,706
>> BABE, I THINK THE BABY'S

942
00:56:50,708 --> 00:56:51,039
COMING.

943
00:56:51,041 --> 00:56:52,508
>> OH, MY GOD!

944
00:56:52,510 --> 00:56:54,343
EXCUSE ME, EVERYONE.

945
00:56:54,345 --> 00:56:55,944
MY WIFE IS IN LABOR.

946
00:56:55,946 --> 00:56:59,214
IS THERE A DOCTOR ON BOARD?

947
00:56:59,216 --> 00:56:59,848
PLEASE, WE NEED A DOCTOR.

948
00:56:59,850 --> 00:57:00,382
IS ANYONE A DOCTOR?

949
00:57:00,384 --> 00:57:03,118
>> I'M A LAWYER.

950
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:03,752
>> WHAT?

951
00:57:03,754 --> 00:57:04,953
THAT'S NOT WHAT WE NEED.

952
00:57:04,955 --> 00:57:07,156
>> I'M JUST SAYING, PRETTY GOOD

953
00:57:07,158 --> 00:57:09,158
JOB, YOU KNOW?

954
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:10,792
IT'S NOT A DOCTOR, SECOND BEST

955
00:57:10,794 --> 00:57:12,327
JOB IS A LAWYER.

956
00:57:12,329 --> 00:57:14,997
>> WHO CARES IF LAWYER'S THE

957
00:57:14,999 --> 00:57:15,564
SECOND BEST JOB?

958
00:57:15,566 --> 00:57:20,736
IS ANYONE IN HERE A DOCTOR?

959
00:57:20,738 --> 00:57:21,370
OH, THANK GOD.

960
00:57:21,372 --> 00:57:23,472
>> OH, I'M NOT A DOCTOR.

961
00:57:23,474 --> 00:57:25,374
I JUST WANTED TO SAY, I DON'T

962
00:57:25,376 --> 00:57:27,609
THINK LAWYER IS THE SECOND BEST

963
00:57:27,611 --> 00:57:27,910
JOB.

964
00:57:27,912 --> 00:57:29,478
>> NOBODY CARES RIGHT NOW.

965
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:30,412
>> I CARE.

966
00:57:30,414 --> 00:57:32,714
IF LAWYER'S NOT NUMBER TWO, THEN

967
00:57:32,716 --> 00:57:33,348
WHAT IS?

968
00:57:33,350 --> 00:57:36,852
>> I MEAN, GOT TO BE ENGINEER.

969
00:57:36,854 --> 00:57:37,186
>> OKAY.

970
00:57:37,188 --> 00:57:38,020
LET ME GUESS.

971
00:57:38,022 --> 00:57:39,721
YOU'RE AN ENGINEER?

972
00:57:39,723 --> 00:57:41,723
>> NO, I'M A LAWYER.

973
00:57:41,725 --> 00:57:44,059
I JUST GENUINELY BELIEVE

974
00:57:44,061 --> 00:57:45,427
ENGINEER IS NUMBER TWO.

975
00:57:45,429 --> 00:57:47,796
>> HOLD ON.

976
00:57:47,798 --> 00:57:48,130
HOLD ON.

977
00:57:48,132 --> 00:57:49,231
HOW IS ENGINEER NUMBER TWO?

978

>> HOW IS LAWYER NUMBER TWO?

979
00:57:51,302 --> 00:57:53,368
>> WELL, BEING A LAWYER IS HARD.

980
00:57:53,370 --> 00:57:54,436
SOMETIMES AN INNOCENT MAN GOES

981
00:57:54,438 --> 00:57:55,204
TO JAIL, AND THEN YOU DON'T GET

982
00:57:55,206 --> 00:57:57,506
PAID.

983
00:57:57,508 --> 00:57:59,775
>> I AGREE.

984
00:57:59,777 --> 00:58:01,610
LAWYER SOUNDS HARD.

985
00:58:01,612 --> 00:58:04,213
AND I SHOULD KNOW, I ALSO HAVE A

986
00:58:04,215 --> 00:58:04,613
HARD JOB.

987
00:58:04,615 --> 00:58:05,113
>> THANK YOU.

988
00:58:05,115 --> 00:58:05,981
WHAT DO YOU DO?

989
00:58:05,983 --> 00:58:07,950
>> I'M A TEACHER.

990
00:58:07,952 --> 00:58:09,318
SO I TEACH FUTURE LAWYERS AND

991
00:58:09,320 --> 00:58:09,651
DOCTORS.

992
00:58:09,653 --> 00:58:13,956
>> BOO!

993
00:58:13,958 --> 00:58:14,590
>> OKAY.

994
00:58:14,592 --> 00:58:17,125
I'M BEGGING YOU, WE'LL TAKE ANY

995
00:58:17,127 --> 00:58:18,360
DOCTOR, ANY KIND OF DOCTOR.

996
00:58:18,362 --> 00:58:21,830
>> I'M A KIND OF DOCTOR.

997
00:58:21,832 --> 00:58:24,399
>> NO, NO, NO.

998
00:58:24,401 --> 00:58:25,167
NOT YOU.

999
00:58:25,169 --> 00:58:25,934
>> OKAY.

1000
00:58:25,936 --> 00:58:27,336
>> ALL RIGHT.

1001
00:58:27,338 --> 00:58:28,136
ALL RIGHT.

1002
00:58:28,138 --> 00:58:29,571
LET'S DO A QUICK POLL.

1003
00:58:29,573 --> 00:58:34,876
SO WE ALL AGREE DOCTOR IS NUMBER

1004
00:58:34,878 --> 00:58:35,344
ONE, NO DOUBT.

1005
00:58:35,346 --> 00:58:37,479
>> FOR SURE.

1006
00:58:37,481 --> 00:58:39,281
>> THEN FOR NUMBER TWO, IT'S

1007
00:58:39,283 --> 00:58:41,316
BETWEEN LAWYER AND ENGINEER.

1008
00:58:41,318 --> 00:58:43,085
>> WELL, I THINK I HAVE THE

1009
00:58:43,087 --> 00:58:46,154
HARDEST JOB OF ALL.

1010
00:58:46,156 --> 00:58:47,489
>> WHAT DO YOU DO?

1011
00:58:47,491 --> 00:58:52,261
>> I AM A MOTHER.

1012
00:58:52,663 --> 00:58:53,028
>> OKAY.

1013
00:58:53,030 --> 00:58:59,501
BUT IN TERMS OF REAL STUFF, LIKE

1014
00:58:59,503 --> 00:59:04,273
JOBS THAT ACTUALLY PAY MONEY.

1015
00:59:04,275 --> 00:59:06,775
>> WELL, I'M A PILOT.

1016
00:59:06,777 --> 00:59:08,644
I FERRY HUNDREDS OF SOULS

1017
00:59:08,646 --> 00:59:09,578
THROUGH THE SKIES, AND I THINK

1018
00:59:09,580 --> 00:59:12,447
THAT'S THE SECOND BEST JOB.

1019
00:59:12,449 --> 00:59:13,815
>> WAIT.

1020
00:59:13,817 --> 00:59:15,851
IF YOU'VE BEEN IN THE BATHROOM,

1021
00:59:15,853 --> 00:59:18,086
WHO'S FLYING THE PLANE?

1022
00:59:18,088 --> 00:59:21,023
>> OH, NO!

1023
00:59:21,025 --> 00:59:24,793
THE AUTOPILOT, DUMB-ASS.

1024
00:59:24,795 --> 00:59:27,029
I GUESS PILOT IS PRETTY EASY.

1025
00:59:27,031 --> 00:59:29,898
BUT NOT AS EASY AS TEACHER.

1026
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:32,701
>> BOO!

1027
00:59:32,703 --> 00:59:34,202
>> WHOO, WHOO.

1028
00:59:34,204 --> 00:59:36,371

1030
00:59:37,975 --> 00:59:40,108
SO THE BEST THING FOR YOUR WIFE

1031

RIGHT NOW IS WE FIGURE OUT WHAT

1032
