1
00:00:08,215 --> 00:00:09,822
NEWS HOUR

2
00:00:11,489 --> 00:00:16,074
>>> GOOD EVENING.
I'M JUDY WOODRUFF.
AND THIS IS THE PBS NEWS HOUR.

3
00:00:16,074 --> 00:00:20,171
WE'RE WHAT YOUR GRANDMA IS
TALKING ABOUT WHEN SHE SAYS, I
SAW THIS ON THE NEWS.

4
00:00:20,171 --> 00:00:24,551
WITH THE MIDTERMS LESS THAN TWO
WEEKS AWAY, REPUBLICANS SEEM TO BE SURGING

5
00:00:24,551 --> 00:00:27,788
WITH A STRONG MESSAGE
FROM CANDIDATES WHO HAVE GONE

6
00:00:27,788 --> 00:00:30,654
FROM UNDERDOGS TO
STARS OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY.

7
00:00:30,654 --> 00:00:33,451
BUT HOW?
TONIGHT WE SPEAK TO THREE OF
THEM.

8
00:00:33,451 --> 00:00:37,318
FIRST, SENATE CANDIDATE FROM
GEORGIA, HERSCHEL WALKER.

9
00:00:37,318 --> 00:00:39,369
>> HELLO, JUDICE.

10
00:00:39,369 --> 00:00:43,123
MY NAME IS HERSCHEL WALKER,
TEXAS RANGER.

11
00:00:43,123 --> 00:00:47,280
AND I'M RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT OF
THE UNITED AIRLINES.

12
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:52,079
>> NEXT IS PENNSYLVANIA'S
REPUBLICAN SENATE CANDIDATE,
DR. OZ.

13
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:53,746
>> HELLO, JUDY!

14
00:00:53,746 --> 00:00:58,148
MY PENNSYLVANIA PHILLIES ARE IN
THE WORLD SERIES.

15
00:00:58,148 --> 00:01:03,591
AND I JUST HAD A DELICIOUS
PHILADELPHIA CHEESE AND STEAK.

16
00:01:03,591 --> 00:01:05,366
YUM!

17
00:01:05,366 --> 00:01:10,746
>> ALSO JOINING US IS ARIZONA'S
REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE FOR
GOVERNOR -- KERI LAKE.

18
00:01:10,746 --> 00:01:12,926
>> GREAT TO BE WITH YOU, JUDY

19
00:01:12,926 --> 00:01:16,557
ON YOUR SWEET LITTLE SHOW FULL OF
LIES.

20
00:01:16,933 --> 00:01:21,656
>> OKAY.
WELL, ALL THREE OF YOU HAVE BEEN
GAINING IN THE POLLS THE PAST FEW WEEKS

21
00:01:21,656 --> 00:01:24,554
DESPITE NONE OF YOU
HAVING ANY POLITICAL EXPERIENCE.

22
00:01:24,554 --> 00:01:26,552
>> CORRECT.
>> PROUD OF IT.

23
00:01:26,552 --> 00:01:31,104
>> MR. WALKER, YOU'RE NOW WITHIN
PLEA POINTS OF SENATOR RAPHAEL
WARNOCK.

24
00:01:31,105 --> 00:01:32,715
GROWING

25
00:01:32,715 --> 00:01:35,726
DON'T KNOW

26
00:01:35,726 --> 00:01:38,161
THE WHOLE WORLD IS A MYSTERY,
AIN'T IT?

27
00:01:38,161 --> 00:01:42,069
FOR PER EXAMPLE, A THERMOS,
IT KEEPS THE HOT THINGS HOT,

28
00:01:42,069 --> 00:01:44,744
BUT
ALSO THE COLD THINGS COLD.

29
00:01:44,744 --> 00:01:47,766
MY QUESTION IS, HOW DO IT
DECIDE?

30
00:01:47,766 --> 00:01:50,568
SO WE GOING TO BE LOOKING INTO
THAT VERY MUCH.

31
00:01:50,568 --> 00:01:52,855
>> WELL, YOU'VE HAD A TOUGH
CAMPAIGN.

32
00:01:52,855 --> 00:01:55,605
A SECOND WOMAN HAS NOW CLAIMED
YOU PAID FOR HER ABORTION,

33
00:01:55,605 --> 00:01:58,698
AND A
EX-WIFE HAS SAID YOU ONCE HELD A
GUN TO HER HEAD.

34
00:01:58,698 --> 00:02:02,038
WHY ARE MILLIONS OF GEORGIA RESIDENTS VOTING
FOR YOU?

35
00:02:02,038 --> 00:02:03,685
>> GAS.

36
00:02:03,685 --> 00:02:08,315
>> OKAY.
GAS PRICES ARE HIGH, BUT IS
THERE MORE TO IT THAN THAT?

37
00:02:08,315 --> 00:02:10,482
OF COURSE THERE IS.
I'M FUN.

38
00:02:10,482 --> 00:02:13,949
IF YOU WANT TO GET ON THE JUMBO
TRON AT THE PACKERS GAME,

39
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:16,696
DON'T

40
00:02:16,696 --> 00:02:19,583
YOU
GOT TO TAKE YOUR SHIRT OFF
AND SHAKE BELLY

41
00:02:19,584 --> 00:02:21,279
DOING

42
00:02:21,279 --> 00:02:23,288
LOVE

43
00:02:23,288 --> 00:02:25,149
LIKE THE GREAT DONALD TRUMP SAID,

44
00:02:25,149 --> 00:02:30,123
I CAN PAY FOR AN ABORTION
IN THE MIDDLE OF FIFTH AVENUE
AND NOT LOSE ANY VOTERS.

45
00:02:30,123 --> 00:02:34,983
THAT'S A PROMISE FROM ME, HER
SHELL.

46
00:02:34,984 --> 00:02:36,275
VERY WELL.

47
00:02:36,275 --> 00:02:39,934
NOW, DR. OZ, YOU CAUGHT UP TO
YOUR CANDIDATE RECENTLY.

48
00:02:39,934 --> 00:02:41,762
SURPRISE

49
00:02:41,762 --> 00:02:45,396
>> I SURE HAVE.
I WAS A LONG HAD SHOT JUDY.

50
00:02:45,396 --> 00:02:50,015
BUT I WAS TOLD, YOU CAN WIN THIS
ELECTION IF YOU'RE HONEST, FAIR,

51
00:02:50,015 --> 00:02:54,281
AND IF YOUR OPPONENT HAS A
DEBILITATING MEDICAL EMERGENCY.

52
00:02:54,281 --> 00:02:56,615
WE'RE VERY LUCKY.

53
00:02:56,615 --> 00:03:02,359
>> MS. LAKE, AHEAD

54
00:03:02,359 --> 00:03:03,321
I HAVE

55
00:03:03,321 --> 00:03:07,389
YOU WERE A LOCAL
NEWS ANCHOR AND A DEMOCRAT FOR SEVERAL YEARS,
- CORRECT.

56
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:09,880
AND YOU'RE
GAINING VOTERS, WHY?

57
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:12,348
>> BECAUSE I'M NORMAL, JUDY.

58
00:03:12,349 --> 00:03:14,932
REGULAR HOMETOWN GAL

59
00:03:14,932 --> 00:03:19,934
SOFT FOCUS

60
00:03:19,934 --> 00:03:25,509
FRANKLY
I'VE MET WITH THE WONDERFULLY
TERRIFIED OLD PEOPLE

61
00:03:25,509 --> 00:03:28,709
HERE IN
FLORIDA OF THE WEST.

62
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:31,172
ALSO, I'M A FIGHTER.

63
00:03:31,172 --> 00:03:34,850
IN MY LIFE, I'VE SENT BACK OVER
2,000 SALADS, OKAY?

64
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:38,105
AND I'M NOT AFRAID TO DO THE
SAME THING WITH DEMOCRACY.

65
00:03:38,105 --> 00:03:41,537
>> VERY WELL.
NOW, ONE OF YOUR MAIN CAMPAIGN ISSUES

66
00:03:41,537 --> 00:03:44,388
IS THE DENIAL OF 2020
ELECTION.

67
00:03:44,388 --> 00:03:49,796
>> CAN YOU MEDIA TYPES GET OVER
THE ONE THING I'VE MADE THE
CENTER OF MY CAMPAIGN FOR MONTHS
AND MONTHS.

68
00:03:49,796 --> 00:03:53,806
ARIZONAENS WANT TO TALK ABOUT
THINGS THAT AFFECT THEM,

69
00:03:53,806 --> 00:03:56,760
LIKE
CRIME IN NEW YORK OR CRIME IN DETROIT,

70
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:01,636
OR THE MOST PRESSING
ISSUE, DRAG QUEEN STORY TIME,

71
00:04:01,637 --> 00:04:04,726
MEN DRESSED LIKE SASSY WOMEN

72
00:04:04,726 --> 00:04:07,366
INTRODUCING CHILDREN TO THE JOYS
OF READING.

73
00:04:07,366 --> 00:04:09,391
NOT ON MY WATCH?

74
00:04:09,391 --> 00:04:12,680
>> CAN YOU PASS IT TO ME,
PLEASE?
I'M OPEN.

75
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,352
LISTEN, JUDICE.

76
00:04:14,352 --> 00:04:18,381
WE GOT BABIES OUT HERE IN SCHOOL
FIEG AS A POKEMON.

77
00:04:18,381 --> 00:04:20,571
THAT'S CRAZY.

78
00:04:20,571 --> 00:04:24,288
MY SON IS A BOY LAST TIME I
CHECKED BY TEXT.

79
00:04:24,288 --> 00:04:28,995
HE CERTAINLY AIN'T NO SNORLAX.
AND THAT'S JUST ALL RIGHT.

80
00:04:28,995 --> 00:04:31,985
EXCUSE ME.
I'M GETTING ALL WORKED UP RIGHT
NOW.

81
00:04:31,985 --> 00:04:34,726
MY HEAD IS GETTING VERY HOT.

82
00:04:34,726 --> 00:04:37,726
>> JUDY, WE NEED TO TAKE CARE OF
OURSELVES,

83
00:04:37,726 --> 00:04:41,714
AND I RECOMMEND THIS
MIRACULOUS DRUG

84
00:04:41,714 --> 00:04:46,973
TO HELP THEM
LOSE 30 POUNDS IN JUST ONE
CALENDAR DAY.

85
00:04:46,973 --> 00:04:51,968
>> GREAT.
NOW, MS. LAKE, YOU HAVE PROPOSED
SOME BIG CHANGES TO LOCAL VOTING
LAWS.

86
00:04:51,968 --> 00:04:56,334
IF YOU BECOME GOVERNOR, DO YOU
PROMISE TO MAKE SURE EVERYONE'S
VOTE COUNTS?

87
00:04:56,335 --> 00:04:58,097
EASY

88
00:04:58,097 --> 00:05:00,539
IF THE PEOPLE OF ARIZONA ELECT ME,

89
00:05:00,539 --> 00:05:05,074
I'LL MAKE SURE THEY
NEVER HAVE TO VOTE EVER AGAIN.

90
00:05:05,074 --> 00:05:08,238
>> SOME PEOPLE ARE SAYING THAT
KIND OF ELECTION,

91
00:05:08,238 --> 00:05:10,663
DENIAL
CONTRIBUTES TO VIOLENCE.

92
00:05:10,664 --> 00:05:12,099
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

93
00:05:12,099 --> 00:05:16,994
LIKE CRAZY ODD MEN IN
TACTICAL GEAR WAVING ASSAULT
RIFLES AT BALLOT BOXES?

94
00:05:16,994 --> 00:05:18,945
THAT'S JUST ARIZONA, BABY.

95
00:05:18,945 --> 00:05:24,706
NOTHING I SAY CAN BE INCENDIARY
BECAUSE I SAY IT IN TV VOICE.

96
00:05:24,706 --> 00:05:27,268
SO JUMP ON TO KERI LAKE,
ARIZONA.

97
00:05:27,268 --> 00:05:29,597
IT'S PLACID AND SERENE ON TOP,

98
00:05:29,597 --> 00:05:33,343
BUT UNDERNEATH, IT'S A WHOLE LOT
OF GIARDIA.

99
00:05:33,343 --> 00:05:35,716
>> THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE,

100
00:05:35,716 --> 00:05:38,184
AND THANK YOU TO DR. OZ AND HERSCHEL
WALKER.

101
00:05:38,184 --> 00:05:40,641
>> GO HALLOWEEN.

102
00:05:40,641 --> 00:05:46,108
RETURN
ICE CREAM

103
00:05:46,108 --> 00:05:49,942
>> LIVE FROM NEW YORK, IT'S
SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE!

104
00:07:43,616 --> 00:07:49,090
HOST AND MUSICAL GUEST, JACK
HARLOW.

105
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:57,161
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, JACK

106
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:23,773
>>> THANK YOU.
THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU.

107
00:08:23,773 --> 00:08:27,165
THIS IS INCREDIBLE.

108
00:08:27,165 --> 00:08:31,426
MY NAME IS JACK HARLOW.
IT'S BEEN A BIG YEAR FOR ME.

109
00:08:34,453 --> 00:08:38,694
I PUT OUT MY SECOND ALBUM.
I WENT ON A WORLD TOUR.

110
00:08:38,694 --> 00:08:42,359
I JUST SHOT MY FIRST MOVIE,
WHITE MEN CAN'T JUMP.

111
00:08:45,471 --> 00:08:49,191
AND A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE BEEN
SAYING, LIKE, I'M THE G.O.A.T.

112
00:08:50,331 --> 00:08:54,627
BUT, YOU KNOW, THEY DON'T MEAN
GREATEST OF ALL TIME.
THEY MEAN THAT ONE FROM NARNIA.

113
00:08:58,737 --> 00:09:05,133
YEAH, I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS
ABOUT ME, BUT PEOPLE ON THE
INTERNET LIKE TO ROAST ME.

114
00:09:05,133 --> 00:09:07,172
AND I DON'T MIND.
I THINK IT'S FUNNY.

115
00:09:07,172 --> 00:09:10,548
I SAW ONE GUY SAY, I DON'T KNOW
WHY Y'ALL THINK JACK HARLOW IS
SO SPECIAL.

116
00:09:10,548 --> 00:09:14,557
YOU CAN FIND ANYONE THAT LOOKS
LIKE HIM AT ANY LOCAL GAS
STATION.

117
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:22,448
I'VE HEARD THEM SAY I LOOK LIKE
IF YOU TRIED TO DRAW JUSTIN
TIMBERLAKE FROM MEMORY.

118
00:09:29,516 --> 00:09:34,000
I THINK MY FAVORITE ONE IS JACK
HARLOW LOOKS LIKE THE GUY

119
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,264
WHO
RIPS THE TICKETS IN HALF AT THE
MOVIE THEATER.

120
00:09:38,383 --> 00:09:40,887
WHAT, Y'ALL AGREE WITH THAT?

121
00:09:42,502 --> 00:09:45,649
THERE'S ALSO A STRANGE AMOUNT OF
RUMORS ABOUT ME.

122
00:09:45,649 --> 00:09:49,169
SOME PEOPLE THINK I'M ONLY
5'10", STOP IT.

123
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:54,757
OTHER PEOPLE THINK I WAS CREATED
BY THE CIA.
NO TELLING.

124
00:09:54,757 --> 00:09:59,461
SOME PEOPLE HAVE EVEN GONE AS
FAR AS ACCUSING ME OF BEING
WHITE.

125
00:10:05,459 --> 00:10:09,634
AND I'VE SEEN A LOT OF KIDS
RUNNING AROUND DRESSED AS ME FOR
HALLOWEEN,

126
00:10:09,634 --> 00:10:11,832
AND I WANT TO SAY,
CUT IT OUT.

127
00:10:11,832 --> 00:10:15,423
MY CULTURE IS NOT A COSTUME.

128
00:10:17,702 --> 00:10:21,413
I'VE ALSO HEARD PEOPLE TRY TO
ROMANTICALLY LINK

129
00:10:21,413 --> 00:10:24,226
ME AND LIL NAS
X AS AN ITEM.

130
00:10:26,705 --> 00:10:29,421
I'M GOING TO TELL YOU RIGHT NOW,
NO.

131
00:10:29,421 --> 00:10:33,513
EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED BETWEEN
HIM AND I WAS CASUAL

132
00:10:34,317 --> 00:10:36,717
AND CONSENSUAL

133
00:10:36,717 --> 00:10:40,367
AND ONE OF THE BEST
NIGHTS OF MY ENTIRE LIFE.

134
00:10:43,037 --> 00:10:46,711
WORKING WITH HIM, WORKING WITH
HIM.

135
00:10:46,711 --> 00:10:51,235
WHAT'S REALLY CRAZY, THOUGH, IS
THIS SHOW IS LIVE.

136
00:10:51,236 --> 00:10:52,461
REALLY

137
00:10:52,461 --> 00:10:58,010
IT'S ONE OF THE LAST REAL LIVE
SHOWS.
BASICALLY IT'S THIS AND "THE
OFFICE."

138
00:10:58,581 --> 00:11:01,170
I CAN DO ANYTHING RIGHT NOW.

139
00:11:01,171 --> 00:11:05,935
LIKE NO ONE CAN STOP ME.
I DON'T EVEN HAVE TO STAY ON
THIS STAGE.

140
00:11:08,477 --> 00:11:11,686
IN FACT, I THINK I WOULD LIKE TO
LEAVE THIS STAGE.

141
00:11:11,686 --> 00:11:14,255
THANK YOU

142
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:22,025
- WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
- McKAYLA.

143
00:11:22,025 --> 00:11:25,130
>> EVERYBODY GIVE IT UP FOR
McKAYLA PLEASE.

144
00:11:29,597 --> 00:11:33,486
IS THERE ANYTHING YOU WOULD LIKE
TO SAY WITH THE WORLD WATCHING?

145
00:11:33,486 --> 00:11:37,411
>> HUGE JACK HARLOW FAN.
>> UNBELIEVABLE.

146
00:11:37,411 --> 00:11:41,763
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
EVERYONE, SERIOUSLY, GIVE IT UP
FOR McKAYLA.

147
00:11:45,402 --> 00:11:46,767
THAT'S BEAUTIFUL.

148
00:11:46,767 --> 00:11:49,091
LISTEN.
I JUST WANT TO GIVE A SHOUTOUT

00:23:22,817 --> 00:23:25,101
GUY WHO WAS IN A GROUP COSTUME

486
00:23:25,103 --> 00:23:26,659
BUT LOST HIS FRIENDS.

487
00:23:26,661 --> 00:23:28,515
>> MY FRIENDS AND I WENT AS THE

488
00:23:28,517 --> 00:23:30,205
VILLAGE PEOPLE, AND NOW I CAN'T

489
00:23:30,207 --> 00:23:31,431
FIND THEM.

490
00:23:31,433 --> 00:23:32,491
NOW EVERYBODY THINKS I'M A REAL

491
00:23:32,493 --> 00:23:34,612
COP, AND I'M NOT.

492
00:23:34,614 --> 00:23:36,004
THIS IS A SQUIRT GUN.

493
00:23:36,006 --> 00:23:37,064
IT'S FILLED WITH TEQUILA.

494
00:23:37,066 --> 00:23:37,363
I NEED MY FRIENDS!

495
00:23:37,365 --> 00:23:39,152
>> YIKES.

496
00:23:39,154 --> 00:23:41,405
DEAN.

497
00:23:41,407 --> 00:23:44,123
>> WELL, WE HEARD A RUMOR SHE

498
00:23:44,125 --> 00:23:45,581
WOULD BE MAKING AN APPEARANCE.

499
00:23:45,583 --> 00:23:46,608
IT'S AN IMPOSSIBLY DRUNK DORA

500
00:23:46,610 --> 00:23:47,768
THE EXPLORER.

501
00:23:47,770 --> 00:23:49,823
THIS IS FUN.

502
00:23:49,825 --> 00:23:52,241
SHE'S -- WHOA!

503
00:23:52,243 --> 00:23:53,799
SHE'S SO FADED, SHE'S ONLY

504
00:23:53,801 --> 00:23:55,423
SAYING ONE THING, AND IT HAS

505
00:23:55,425 --> 00:23:57,378
ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO DO WITH

506
00:23:57,380 --> 00:23:58,670
HER COSTUME.

507
00:23:58,672 --> 00:23:59,698
>> TOM BRADY.

508
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:00,526
>> ONE MORE TIME.

509
00:24:00,528 --> 00:24:03,144
>> TOM BRADY.

510
00:24:03,146 --> 00:24:03,476
>> ALL RIGHT.

511
00:24:03,478 --> 00:24:04,237
AND WHY ARE YOU SAYING TOM

512
00:24:04,239 --> 00:24:05,232
BRADY.

513
00:24:05,234 --> 00:24:06,623
>> TOM BRADY.

514
00:24:06,625 --> 00:24:10,633
>> OKAY.

515
00:24:10,635 --> 00:24:10,931
WELL, BEST OF LUCK TONIGHT, AND

516
00:24:10,933 --> 00:24:11,959
I HOPE YOU FIND YOUR PANTS.

517
00:24:11,961 --> 00:24:12,754
TINA.

518
00:24:12,756 --> 00:24:14,709
>> OKAY.

519
00:24:14,711 --> 00:24:16,995
WELL, I DON'T THINK HE'S GOING

520
00:24:16,997 --> 00:24:21,271
TO STOP, BUT BEHIND ME, YOU CAN

521
00:24:21,273 --> 00:24:22,430
SEE THE SOBER MIDDLE-AGED MAN

522
00:24:22,432 --> 00:24:23,954
WHO IS TRYING TO WALK HIS DOG.

523
00:24:23,956 --> 00:24:24,883
>> EXCUSE ME.

524
00:24:24,885 --> 00:24:25,247
PEOPLE LIVE HERE.

525
00:24:25,249 --> 00:24:27,202
THANK YOU!

526
00:24:27,204 --> 00:24:29,588
>> DEAN.

527
00:24:29,590 --> 00:24:32,604
>> WELL, HERE'S SOMETHING YOU

528
00:24:32,606 --> 00:24:35,718
DON'T NORMALLY SEE AT 3:00 A.M.,

529
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:36,083
IT'S A DAD WHO CLEARLY FORGOT TO

530
00:24:36,085 --> 00:24:38,336
TAKE HIS KID TRICK OR TREATING

531
00:24:38,338 --> 00:24:39,198
EARLIER.

532
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,126
>> GO ASK HIM FOR SOME CANDY.

533
00:24:40,128 --> 00:24:41,982
>> I DON'T HAVE ANY.

534
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:43,241
I'M SORRY.

535
00:24:43,243 --> 00:24:44,036
CAN I ASK WHY YOU HAVE A CHILD

536
00:24:44,038 --> 00:24:45,461
OUT AT 3:00 IN THE MORNING?

537
00:24:45,463 --> 00:24:47,980
>> YEAH.

538
00:24:47,982 --> 00:24:49,703
YOU CAN ASK SHEILA.

539
00:24:49,705 --> 00:24:52,586
SHE TEXTED ME AT 8:00 P.M.

540
00:24:52,588 --> 00:24:54,807
SAYING I'M DROPPING HIM OFF, AND

541
00:24:54,808 --> 00:24:56,860
I SAID, NOT MY WEEKEND, SHEILA.

542
00:24:56,862 --> 00:24:59,148
I'M GETTING MY DRINK ON, SHEILA.

543
00:24:59,150 --> 00:24:59,413
AND SHE SAID, IT IS YOUR

544
00:24:59,415 --> 00:25:01,268
WEEKEND, WHICH IT TURNED OUT IT

545
00:25:01,270 --> 00:25:03,886
WAS.

546
00:25:03,888 --> 00:25:07,233
WE OUT HERE, SO IT'S FINE.

547
00:25:07,235 --> 00:25:12,303
>> WHAT'S YOUR CHILD DRESSED AS?

548
00:25:12,305 --> 00:25:12,602
>> OH, HE A CHIPOTLE BAG.

549
00:25:12,604 --> 00:25:12,866
>> OH, THAT'S SO COOL, BUDDY!

550
00:25:12,868 --> 00:25:13,165
YEAH.

551
00:25:13,167 --> 00:25:13,927
WOW.

552
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:15,981
TINA.

553
00:25:15,983 --> 00:25:18,069
>> WOW INDEED.

554
00:25:18,071 --> 00:25:20,189
WELL, WE HAVE TO TAKE A BREAK,

555
00:25:20,191 --> 00:25:22,078
BUT WE HAVE SO MUCH MORE AHEAD,

556
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:25,591
INCLUDING TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

557
00:25:25,593 --> 00:25:25,956
IF THE GUY BEHIND ME IS DRESSED

558
00:25:25,958 --> 00:25:27,812
AS DAHMER OR IS AN ACTUAL

559
00:25:27,814 --> 00:25:29,899
PERVERT.

560
00:25:29,901 --> 00:25:31,722
>> I VOTE FOR PERVERT.

561
00:25:31,724 --> 00:25:32,617
PLUS MORE WITH OUR BAD DAD.

562
00:25:32,619 --> 00:25:34,638
>> HEY, MAN.

563
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:34,937
I'M A GOOD DAD.

564
00:25:34,939 --> 00:25:35,334
YOU KNOW WHERE I CAN GET SOME

565
00:25:35,336 --> 00:25:37,820
COKE?

566
00:25:43,984 --> 00:25:59,243
>> I DO NOT. KEEP IT RIGHT HERE.

567
00:26:06,899 --> 00:26:10,312
>>> AND THAT'S WHEN I LOOKED IN

568
00:26:10,314 --> 00:26:12,796
THE MIRROR AND I DIDN'T SEE

569
00:26:12,798 --> 00:26:15,382
MYSELF ANYMORE.

570
00:26:15,384 --> 00:26:15,680
I SAW A GUY WHO STEALS FROM HIS

571
00:26:15,682 --> 00:26:18,861
OWN MOTHER FOR ANOTHER BOTTLE OF

572
00:26:18,863 --> 00:26:19,324
BOOZE.

573
00:26:19,326 --> 00:26:21,412
BUT I'M GRATEFUL FOR 90 DAYS

574
00:26:21,414 --> 00:26:23,831
WITH NO DRINK.

575
00:26:23,833 --> 00:26:25,654
>> THANK YOU SO MUCH, SPENCER.

576
00:26:25,656 --> 00:26:27,112
WHO ELSE WOULD LIKE TO SHARE.

577
00:26:27,114 --> 00:26:28,802
HOW ABOUT YOU, JESSE?

578
00:26:28,804 --> 00:26:29,300
YOU HAVE BEEN COMING FOR A

579
00:26:29,302 --> 00:26:30,459
WHILE, AND YOU'VE NEVER SHARED

580
00:26:30,461 --> 00:26:32,149
WITH THE GROUP.

581
00:26:32,151 --> 00:26:32,481
>> WELL, THERE IS SOMETHING I

582
00:26:32,483 --> 00:26:33,276
HAVE BEEN THINKING ABOUT FOR A

583
00:26:33,278 --> 00:26:34,535
WHILE.

584
00:26:34,537 --> 00:26:34,900
>> PLEASE.

585
00:26:34,902 --> 00:26:35,231
YOU CAN TELL THIS GROUP

586
00:26:35,233 --> 00:26:38,545
ANYTHING.

587
00:26:38,547 --> 00:26:42,687
>> OKAY.

588
00:26:42,689 --> 00:26:43,118
HERE IT GOES.

589
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,708
I HAVE THE PERFECT IDEA FOR A

590
00:26:44,710 --> 00:26:47,160
PIXAR MOVIE.

591
00:26:47,162 --> 00:26:51,005
>> WHAT'S THAT?

592
00:26:51,007 --> 00:26:51,734
>> A CONCEPT FOR A TOUCHING

593
00:26:51,736 --> 00:26:52,330
COMPUTER ANIMATED FILM THAT'S

594
00:26:52,332 --> 00:26:53,258
ABOUT LOST LUGGAGE TRYING TO

595
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:55,710
FIND ITS WAY HOME.

596
00:26:55,712 --> 00:26:56,075
>> ALL RIGHT.

597
00:26:56,077 --> 00:26:58,891
LET'S JUST STAY ON THE TOPIC OF

598
00:26:58,893 --> 00:26:59,223
RECOVERY.

599
00:26:59,225 --> 00:27:00,648
DOES ANYONE ELSE WANT TO SHARE?

600
00:27:00,650 --> 00:27:01,675
JACKIE?

601
00:27:01,677 --> 00:27:04,492
>> JACKIE, ALCOHOLIC.

602
00:27:04,494 --> 00:27:07,673
>> HI, JACKIE.

603
00:27:07,675 --> 00:27:08,071

SORRY.

606
00:27:12,513 --> 00:27:13,506
SO THE SUITCASES ALL HAVE

607
00:27:13,508 --> 00:27:15,261
PERSONALITIES?

608
00:27:15,263 --> 00:27:15,593
>> YEAH.

609
00:27:15,595 --> 00:27:17,482
AND THE ZIPPERS ARE THEIR

610
00:27:17,484 --> 00:27:17,813
MOUTHS.

611
00:27:17,815 --> 00:27:19,636
I ACTUALLY MARKED UP SOME

612
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:20,166

HE'S A LITTLE UPTIGHT, BUT HE'S

619
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:32,990

01:04:47,974 --> 01:04:49,907
CAN I JUST SAY, WHOP PI.

1461
01:04:49,909 --> 01:04:53,577
IT'S AN HONOR.

1462
01:04:53,579 --> 01:04:55,713
YOU ARE AN ICON.

1463
01:04:55,715 --> 01:04:57,782
>> DON'T COMPLIMENT ME ALL QUIET

1464
01:04:57,784 --> 01:04:58,649
LIKE THAT, JACK.

1465
01:04:58,651 --> 01:05:04,555
I HAVE BEEN CLOSED FOR BUSINESS

1466
01:05:04,557 --> 01:05:06,223
SINCE BEFORE YOU WERE BORN.

1467
01:05:06,225 --> 01:05:06,590
>> WELL, I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO

1468
01:05:06,592 --> 01:05:09,126
THE GRAND REOPENING.

1469
01:05:09,128 --> 01:05:10,895
>> NO.

1470
01:05:10,897 --> 01:05:11,896
I'M A DEAD WOMAN WALKING.

1471
01:05:11,898 --> 01:05:13,731
>> I DON'T MEAN TO BE RUDE TO

1472
01:05:13,733 --> 01:05:15,032
OUR GUEST, BUT THERE IS

1473
01:05:15,034 --> 01:05:16,667
SOMETHING I WANTED TO SAY --

1474
01:05:16,669 --> 01:05:18,869
>> NO, NO.

1475
01:05:18,871 --> 01:05:20,871
WE'RE NOT DOING THIS AGAIN.

1476
01:05:20,873 --> 01:05:22,840
THEY CAME TO THE SHOW TALKING

1477
01:05:22,842 --> 01:05:26,377
ABOUT STOP BIG OIL.

1478
01:05:26,379 --> 01:05:26,711
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO?

1479
01:05:26,713 --> 01:05:27,545
>> IT'S AN IMPORTANT ISSUE,

1480
01:05:27,547 --> 01:05:28,846
WHOOPI.

1481
01:05:28,848 --> 01:05:30,114
>> HOW?

1482
01:05:30,116 --> 01:05:33,050
I DON'T KNOW HIM.

1483
01:05:33,052 --> 01:05:36,620
SAVE THE PLANET.

1484
01:05:36,622 --> 01:05:39,223
I'M ALREADY SAVING OUR RATINGS.

1485
01:05:39,225 --> 01:05:43,094
>> WHOOPI.

1486
01:05:43,096 --> 01:05:43,961
>> JACK, WHAT DO YOU THINK?

1487
01:05:43,963 --> 01:05:45,629
>> IT'S ALL GOOD.

1488
01:05:48,201 --> 01:05:48,499
WHOOPI, IS IT THE GLOBAL

1489
01:05:48,501 --> 01:05:50,601
WARMING, OR IS IT GETTING HOT IN

1490
01:05:50,603 --> 01:05:51,502
HERE?

1491
01:05:51,504 --> 01:05:56,107
>> BABY, PLEASE.

1492
01:05:56,109 --> 01:05:57,875
WE WOULD NEVER WORK.

1493
01:05:57,877 --> 01:06:00,511
THE ONLY MCs I NEED IN MY LIFE

1494
01:06:00,513 --> 01:06:02,913
ARE MY CATS AND MY CIGARETTES.

1495
01:06:02,915 --> 01:06:03,381
>> CAN I JUST SAY, PERSONALLY, I

1496
01:06:03,383 --> 01:06:05,082
THINK WE SHOULD SPEAK ABOUT

1497
01:06:05,084 --> 01:06:05,683
CLIMATE CHANGE.

1498
01:06:05,685 --> 01:06:12,790
>> THANK YOU, SWEETHEART, BUT WE

1499
01:06:12,792 --> 01:06:14,492
MOVED ON.

1500
01:06:14,494 --> 01:06:17,928
BACK TO THE MATTER AT HAND, THE

1501
01:06:17,930 --> 01:06:18,396
ONE AND ONLY BLACK HARLOW.

1502
01:06:18,398 --> 01:06:19,830
>> STOP PLAYING WITH ME.

1503
01:06:19,832 --> 01:06:21,432
IT'S JUST JACK.

1504
01:06:21,434 --> 01:06:34,512
>> I GOT A QUESTION FOR YOU,

1505
01:06:34,514 --> 01:06:34,812
DON'T YOU THINK THE WOMEN IN

1506
01:06:34,814 --> 01:06:35,846
YOUR VIDEOS ARE OBJECTIFYING TO

1507
01:06:35,848 --> 01:06:38,048
WOMEN?

1508
01:06:38,050 --> 01:06:39,517
>> OH, PLEASE.

1509
01:06:39,519 --> 01:06:42,186
THEY TOOK THE DAMN ROLE.

1510
01:06:42,188 --> 01:06:45,556
SO JK WAB WHAT DO YOU SAY?

1511
01:06:45,558 --> 01:06:45,890
>> I GUESS I'LL JUST SAY THERE'S

1512
01:06:45,892 --> 01:06:49,760
A LOT OF BEAUTIFUL GIRLS IN MY

1513
01:06:49,762 --> 01:06:50,094
VIDEOS.

1514
01:06:50,096 --> 01:06:50,961
RIGHT NOW, WHAT I NEED MOST IS A

1515
01:06:50,963 --> 01:06:51,962
WOMAN.

1516
01:06:51,964 --> 01:06:52,396
>> OKAY.

1517
01:06:52,398 --> 01:06:56,267
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TRYING

1518
01:06:56,269 --> 01:06:57,835
TO DO TO ME.

1519
01:06:57,837 --> 01:07:01,772
BUT IT IS WORKING.

1520
01:07:01,774 --> 01:07:03,841
I'M FEELING LIKE INDIANA JONES

1521
01:07:03,843 --> 01:07:06,143
JUST STEPPED ON A BOOBIE TRAP,

1522
01:07:06,145 --> 01:07:09,213
BECAUSE MY WHOLE DUSTY CAVE HAS

1523
01:07:09,215 --> 01:07:11,816
STARTED TO RUMBLE.

1524
01:07:11,818 --> 01:07:12,450
>> I LIKE THAT MOVIE.

1525
01:07:12,452 --> 01:07:14,518
MAYBE WE SHOULD WATCH IT

1526
01:07:14,520 --> 01:07:14,852
TOGETHER SOMETIME.

1527
01:07:14,854 --> 01:07:15,619
I HOPE YOU'RE NOT AFRAID OF

1528
01:07:15,621 --> 01:07:18,389
SNAKES.

1529
01:07:18,391 --> 01:07:21,158
>> OKAY, JACK.

1530
01:07:21,160 --> 01:07:22,226
AM I SENSING A METAPHOR?

1531
01:07:22,228 --> 01:07:26,564
>> WHOOPI, I'VE MET A LOT OF

1532
01:07:26,566 --> 01:07:28,299
FOURS, BUT TODAY, I'VE MET A

1533
01:07:28,301 --> 01:07:30,901
TEN.

1534
01:07:30,903 --> 01:07:32,436
>> WAIT A MINUTE.

1535
01:07:32,438 --> 01:07:36,574
SO THE SNAKE WAS ABOUT HIS --

1536
01:07:36,576 --> 01:07:37,374
OH, MY GOD!

1537
01:07:37,376 --> 01:07:39,343
>> WELL, JOY, I AM WET.

1538
01:07:39,345 --> 01:08:03,434
AND THAT'S ALL THE TIME WE HAVE

1539
01:08:22,053 --> 01:08:33,364
>>> WE WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO

1540
01:08:33,366 --> 01:08:36,800
TOM HANKS!

1541
01:08:36,802 --> 01:08:39,603
BOBBY MOYNIHAN!

1542
01:08:39,605 --> 01:08:40,137
AND JEFF PROBST.

1543
01:08:40,139 --> 01:08:43,541
AND LITERALLY, LITERALLY,

1544
01:08:43,543 --> 01:08:45,843
EVERYONE BEHIND ME.

1545
01:08:45,845 --> 01:08:47,778
THANK YOU.

1546
01:08:47,780 --> 01:08:48,178
I HAD A GREAT TIME THIS WEEK.

1547
01:08:48,180 --> 01:08:50,114
THIS IS GENUINELY A DREAM COME

1548
01:08:50,116 --> 01:08:50,681
TRUE.

1549
01:08:50,683 --> 01:08:51,048
I GREW UP WATCHING THIS.

1550
01:08:51,050 --> 01:08:52,562
I LOVE Y'ALL SO MUCH.
THANK YOU.
