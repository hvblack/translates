1
00:00:03,241 --> 00:00:08,534
>>> WELL, SENATOR, REPUBLICANS
FACE AN UPHILL BATTLE ON
TUESDAY.

2
00:00:09,478 --> 00:00:11,911
I KNOW.
I KNOW.

3
00:00:11,911 --> 00:00:15,321
OBAMA WAS JUST IN GEORGIA
CAMPAIGNING FOR THE OTHER GUY.

4
00:00:15,321 --> 00:00:19,424
DID YOU SEE IT?
IT WAS LIKE A COMEDY CENTRAL
ROAST UP THERE.

5
00:00:19,424 --> 00:00:23,884
I FIGURE I COULD USE SOME
HELP.
SEND HIM IN.

6
00:00:24,268 --> 00:00:26,762
HERSCHEL WALKER.

7
00:00:28,193 --> 00:00:32,445
HEY, THERE.
MS. McDONALD.

8
00:00:32,445 --> 00:00:35,366
I'M SORRY I'M LATE.
I WAS HAVING TOO MUCH FUN

9
00:00:35,366 --> 00:00:37,639
IN
THAT FREE MERRY GO ROUND YOU
HAVE OUT FRONT.

10
00:00:37,639 --> 00:00:41,392
THAT'S A REVOLVING DOOR.

11
00:00:41,392 --> 00:00:45,564
- WELL, GREAT JOB ON YOUR
CAMPAIGN, HER SHELL.
- YES, EXCELLENT.

12
00:00:45,564 --> 00:00:48,947
YOU REMEMBER JON CORNYN.

13
00:00:48,947 --> 00:00:50,640
NO.

14
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,100
AND OF COURSE MARSHA
BLACKBURN, SENATOR FROM TENNESSEE.

15
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:56,321
OH, YOUR HEINESS.

16
00:00:57,241 --> 00:01:02,689
WELL, THE MIDTERMS WASN'T THE
RED WAVE WE WERE HOPING FOR,

17
00:01:02,689 --> 00:01:05,130
BUT
WE WERE HOPING YOU COULD WIN
THIS TUESDAY.

18
00:01:05,130 --> 00:01:07,995
YEAH.
PRIORITY

19
00:01:07,995 --> 00:01:10,429
YOU GOT THIS BIG PRIMARY COMING UP.

20
00:01:10,429 --> 00:01:14,921
KNOW.
WELL, MY EX-WIFE SAID ALL I
DO IS RUN OFF.

21
00:01:14,921 --> 00:01:18,764
NO, HERSCHEL, THE GEORGIA RUNOFF.

22
00:01:18,764 --> 00:01:20,768
IT'S CLOSE.

23
00:01:20,768 --> 00:01:24,280
- HOW CLOSE?
- SO CLOSE.

24
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:27,555
WARNOCK IS POLLING AT 59.4%.

25
00:01:27,555 --> 00:01:30,069
YOU ARE POLLING AT 49.1.

26
00:01:30,069 --> 00:01:34,702
WELL, THE FIRST PRIORITY IS
TO FIGURE OUT WHICH IS BIGGER.

27
00:01:34,702 --> 00:01:37,499
WELL, THE ELECTION IS TUESDAY.

28
00:01:37,499 --> 00:01:39,965
THEY HAVE ALREADY STARTED
COUNTING THE VOTES MY MAIL.

29
00:01:39,965 --> 00:01:44,667
YOU GOT TO REMEMBER.
THEY STILL GOT TO COUNT THE
VOTES BY FEMALE.

30
00:01:45,671 --> 00:01:49,964
SURE.
WE WANTED TO TALK TO YOU

31
00:01:49,964 --> 00:01:53,653
BECAUSE
THIS RUNOFF IS REALLY IMPORTANT.

32
00:01:53,653 --> 00:01:56,092
WE COULD REALLY USE THE WIN
RIGHT NOW.

33
00:01:56,092 --> 00:01:57,403
YOU CAN COUNT ON ME.

34
00:01:57,404 --> 00:01:59,786
ASS
GUM

35
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:02,692
I'M ALL OUT OF BUBBLE GUM.

36
00:02:02,692 --> 00:02:06,501
THREE DAYS
WE WANT TO BE REALLY CAREFUL,

37
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:08,856
AND YOU'VE HAD SOME SCHEDULES ALREADY.

38
00:02:08,856 --> 00:02:11,952
IS THERE ANYTHING WE SHOULD KNOW
IN THE FINAL STRETCH.

39
00:02:11,952 --> 00:02:13,294
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

40
00:02:13,294 --> 00:02:17,412
MAYBE BAD THINGS FROM YOUR
PAST THAT MAYBE PEOPLE DON'T
KNOW YET.

41
00:02:17,412 --> 00:02:20,332
YES.
DEFINITELY.

42
00:02:20,332 --> 00:02:21,978
SO MANY.

43
00:02:21,978 --> 00:02:26,513
WELL, I HATE TO ASK, BUT CAN
YOU TELL US SOME OF THEM?

44
00:02:26,513 --> 00:02:29,376
LET ME SEE.
WHERE DO I START.

45
00:02:29,376 --> 00:02:32,398
SO THERE'S THIS PRETTY LADY THAT
WORKS AT THE McDONALD'S, RIGHT?

46
00:02:32,398 --> 00:02:34,574
SO I WENT DOWN THERE--

47
00:02:40,092 --> 00:02:42,159
ANYWAY,
SHE DIDN'T WANT TO KEEP IT

48
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:45,114
SO I
DROVE HER DOWN TO THE PLANNED
PARENT TRAP.

49
00:02:45,705 --> 00:02:48,571
WOW.
THAT'S A LOT.

50
00:02:48,571 --> 00:02:51,211
THIS MIGHT BE TOUGH.

51
00:02:51,211 --> 00:02:55,179
DON'T WORRY.
I'M FEELING VERY CONFIDENT ABOUT
THIS ERECTION.

52
00:02:55,179 --> 00:02:58,825
DON'T YOU MEAN ELECTION?

53
00:02:58,825 --> 00:03:00,831
I DO NOT.

54
00:03:00,831 --> 00:03:03,678
MAYBE IN THE FINAL PUSH,

55
00:03:03,678 --> 00:03:06,478
LET'S LAY LOW AND FOCUS ON THE MESSAGE.

56
00:03:06,478 --> 00:03:08,494
EXACTLY.
JUST LIKE KANYE.

57
00:03:08,494 --> 00:03:10,446
NO, NO, NO.

58
00:03:10,446 --> 00:03:14,444
ON THE ISSUES PEOPLE CARE ABOUT,
INFLATION, CRIME--

59
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:18,352
VAMPIRES, WEREWOLF,
SCARY GECKO

60
00:03:18,352 --> 00:03:21,153
WE GOING
TO BE LOOKING INTO ALL THAT.

61
00:03:21,153 --> 00:03:25,295
RIGHT. SO MAYBE NONE OF THAT.

62
00:03:25,295 --> 00:03:28,764
REALLY?
BECAUSE THAT'S LIKE 90% OF MY
NEXT SPEECH.

63
00:03:28,764 --> 00:03:30,586
RIGHT.

64
00:03:31,397 --> 00:03:33,699
COULD WE HAVE A MOMENT ALONE?

65
00:03:33,699 --> 00:03:37,441
OH, SURE.
YOU CAN TOSS A BLANKET RIGHT
OVER MEE, AND I'LL FALL ASLEEP.

66
00:03:37,441 --> 00:03:40,789
THAT SOUNDS GREAT.

67
00:03:42,423 --> 00:03:44,694
NIGHT NIGHT.

68
00:03:44,694 --> 00:03:46,604
WELL DONE.

69
00:03:48,308 --> 00:03:50,321
JUST TO BE CLEAR,

70
00:03:50,321 --> 00:03:54,504
LAST HOPE TO WIN THIS YEAR IS HERSCHEL
WALKER?

71
00:03:54,504 --> 00:03:56,681
YEAH.
SO PLAN B?

72
00:03:56,681 --> 00:03:59,048
I DON'T THINK WE HAVE NO CHOICE.

73
00:04:00,415 --> 00:04:02,137
EXCUSE ME.

74
00:04:02,137 --> 00:04:05,534
COME ON, GIRL.
DON'T TRADE THAT IN FOR NO BIG
MAC.

75
00:04:05,534 --> 00:04:07,460
I'M SORRY.

76
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:11,943
- CAN I SHOW YOU SOMETHING VERY
EXCITING?
- OH, YEAH, SURE.

77
00:04:11,943 --> 00:04:15,743
WHY DON'T YOU TAKE A LOOK IN
THERE.

78
00:04:15,743 --> 00:04:19,376
OH, WOW.
LOOK IT'S A LITTLE ROOM.

79
00:04:19,376 --> 00:04:22,057
THAT'S RIGHT.
USED TO BE MY PANIC ROOM.

80
00:04:22,057 --> 00:04:24,446
NOW IT'S ALL YOURS, JUST UNTIL
ELECTION DAY.

81
00:04:24,446 --> 00:04:27,040
WHY AM I ALREADY IN THERE?

82
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,208
THAT'S A MIRROR.

83
00:04:29,208 --> 00:04:33,183
GO ON AHEAD.
YOU GOT EVERYTHING YOU NEED IN THERE.
GET IN THERE.

84
00:04:33,183 --> 00:04:36,628
LOOK AT THAT.
THEY GOT LUNCHABLES IN THERE AND
EVERYTHING.

85
00:04:37,449 --> 00:04:39,424
IT'S ONLY FOR A FEW DAYS,

86
00:04:39,424 --> 00:04:43,555
AND LIVE FROM NEW YORK, IT'S
IT'S "SATURDAY
NIGHT

87
00:06:49,675 --> 00:06:54,418
KEKE PALMER.

88
00:07:15,109 --> 00:07:19,375
>>> THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

89
00:07:19,375 --> 00:07:22,926
I'M SO EXCITED TO BE HERE IN NEW YORK.

90
00:07:23,461 --> 00:07:26,351
IT'S CHRISTMAS TIME, THE TREE IS LIT,

91
00:07:26,351 --> 00:07:29,598
AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, IT'S
SAGITTARIUS SEASON.

92
00:07:29,598 --> 00:07:32,590
AND THAT'S GOOD FOR ME BECAUSE I'M

93
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:35,119
I'M VERY INTO ASTROLOGY.

94
00:07:35,119 --> 00:07:38,401
AND I KNOW SOME ARE GOING TO SAY IT'S NOT REAL,

95
00:07:38,401 --> 00:07:41,730
BUT TO THAT I
SAY, HOW'S THAT CRYPTO GOING.

96
00:07:43,931 --> 00:07:46,849
THIS HAS BEEN AN AWESOME YEAR
FOR ME.

97
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:49,587
NOPE

98
00:07:50,313 --> 00:07:54,226
I WAS NOMINATED FOR AN ACADEMY
AWARD!

99
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:57,110
THAT PART'S NOT TRUE.

100
00:07:57,110 --> 00:08:00,083
BUT IT'S NOT LYING IF

101
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:04,353
THAT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS YOU
JUST LEARN TO DO IN THIS BUSINESS.

102
00:08:04,353 --> 00:08:05,798
AS A MATTER OF FACT, HONEY.

103
00:08:05,798 --> 00:08:08,205
I HAVE BEEN ACTING SINCE I WAS
NINE YEARS OLD.

104
00:08:08,205 --> 00:08:12,357
THE FIRST ROLE I DID WAS IN A
MOVIE.

105
00:08:13,331 --> 00:08:17,331
I HAD SO MUCH FUN,

106
00:08:17,331 --> 00:08:20,095
EXCEPT FOR
WHEN I GOT YELLED AT BY LAWRENCE
FINCHBURG.

107
00:08:20,095 --> 00:08:22,891
DRAMATIC

108
00:08:22,891 --> 00:08:25,382
I STARTED LAUGHING AT HIM.

109
00:08:25,382 --> 00:08:27,976
I HAD A GOOD REASON.

110
00:08:28,057 --> 00:08:32,902
I'M A LITTLE KID WATCHING A
40-YEAR-OLD MAN CRY TO ME ABOUT
WINNING A NATIONAL SPELLING BEE.

111
00:08:32,903 --> 00:08:34,371
HIST

112
00:08:34,371 --> 00:08:37,577
BUT WHEN I STARTED LAUGHING,

113
00:08:37,577 --> 00:08:41,454
HE WAS LIKE, YOU CAN'T DO THIS.
THIS IS NOT WHAT REAL ACTORS DO.

114
00:08:41,454 --> 00:08:44,469
AND MY MAMA WENT OFF ON HIM,
Y'ALL.

115
00:08:44,469 --> 00:08:46,745
SHE'S SO CHICAGO, SHE STARTED
SCREAMING

116
00:08:46,783 --> 00:08:50,784
I DON'T CARE IF YOU
WAS IN THE MATRIX.

117
00:08:54,444 --> 00:08:56,232
THIS IS GOOD TIMES.

118
00:08:56,232 --> 00:08:58,586
AND I HONESTLY DO APPRECIATE
THAT HE DID.

119
00:08:58,586 --> 00:09:00,182
EVEN THOUGH IT WAS INTENSE,

120
00:09:00,182 --> 00:09:03,975
HE TAUGHT ME HOW TO BE A
PROFESSIONAL IN REAL TIME, YOU KNOW.

121
00:09:03,975 --> 00:09:06,653
AND I'VE TAKEN LESSONS FROM
EVERYONE I'VE WORKED WITH.

122
00:09:06,653 --> 00:09:10,098
I RECENTLY GOT SOME GOOD ADVICE
ON BEING ON SNL.

123
00:09:10,098 --> 00:09:14,656
HE WAS LIKE, KEKE, GET UP ON
STAGE, YOU'RE FUNNY.

124
00:09:14,656 --> 00:09:18,169
YOU'RE FUNNIER THAN ME.

125
00:09:19,756 --> 00:09:23,069
HE DIDN'T EXACTLY SAY THAT,
BUT THAT'S WHAT I HEARD.

126
00:09:23,069 --> 00:09:26,226
DELUSIONAL QUEEN.

127
00:09:26,226 --> 00:09:29,387
I'M ESPECIALLY GLAD TO BE HERE, THOUGH,

128
00:09:29,387 --> 00:09:32,881
BECAUSE THERE'S SOME
RUMORS GOING AROUND.

129
00:09:32,881 --> 00:09:37,201
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN IN MY COMMENTS
SAYING KEKE'S HAVING A BABY, KEKE'S PREGNANT,

130
00:09:37,201 --> 00:09:39,377
AND I WANT TO
SET THE RECORD STRAIGHT.

131
00:09:39,377 --> 00:09:41,233
I AM!

132
00:09:57,106 --> 00:10:01,484
I GOT TO SAY,
THOUGH, IT IS BAD WHEN PEOPLE ON
THE INTERNET SPREAD RUMORS ABOUT YOU,

133
00:10:01,484 --> 00:10:03,935
BUT IT'S EVEN WORSE WHEN
THEY'RE CORRECT.

134
00:10:03,935 --> 00:10:07,815
I WAS TRYING SO HARD TO KEEP IT
ON THE DOWN LOW

135
00:10:07,815 --> 00:10:09,436
BECAUSE I GOT A
LOT OF STUFF GOING ON.

136
00:10:09,436 --> 00:10:11,889
PEOPLE KEPT COMING UP TO ME, CONGRATULATIONS.

137
00:10:11,889 --> 00:10:13,785
I'M LIKE, S HAD, H, CAN Y'ALL
STOP?

138
00:10:13,785 --> 00:10:16,988
I GOT A LIQUOR SPONSORSHIP ON
THE LINE.

139
00:10:16,988 --> 00:10:20,980
ONCE THE CHECK CLEARS, WE CAN
GET TO THE BAILEY BI.

140
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:24,265
BUT HONESTLY, THIS HAS BEEN THE
BIGGEST BLESSING.

141
00:10:24,362 --> 00:10:27,873
I'M GOING TO BE A MOM.

142
00:10:29,138 --> 00:10:33,650
EVEN THOUGH SOME PEOPLE FEEL A
LITTLE WEIRD ABOUT ME HAVING A BABY

143
00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:34,989
BECAUSE I WAS A CHILD ACTOR.

144
00:10:34,989 --> 00:10:38,128
I'M 29, I'M GROWN,

145
00:10:38,193 --> 00:10:39,939
I HAVE SEX, A OWN A HOME,

146
00:10:39,939 --> 00:10:42,447
I STORMED THE CAPITOL ON JANUARY 6th,

147
00:10:42,447 --> 00:10:45,575
YOU KNOW, THINGS ADULTS DO.

148
00:10:46,101 --> 00:10:50,398
Y'ALL KNOW I'M THE SAME PERSON
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN, AND I'M PROUD
OF THAT.

149
00:10:50,398 --> 00:10:53,935
AS A MATTER OF FACT, WHEN I
FIRST GOT INTO COMEDY

150
00:10:53,935 --> 00:10:56,561
AND I
DREAMED OF STANDING ON THIS STAGE,

151
00:10:56,561 --> 00:11:00,075
I ASKED MYSELF, KEKE, WHO
WILL YOU BE?

152
00:11:00,134 --> 00:11:03,600
WILL YOU BE LIKE A MYA RUDOLPH, EDDIE MURPHY,

153
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,600
A CRYSTAL WIG
TYPE?

154
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,842

ABOUT HELLO KITTY.

SHE LOVES TO BAKE COOKIES, SHE

LOVES TO GO TO SCHOOL, AND SHE'S

00:23:05,819 --> 00:23:12,459
NOT A CAT, SHE'S A HUMAN LITTLE GIRL.

422
00:23:12,459 --> 00:23:14,928
OH, INTERESTING.

423
00:23:12,459 --> 00:23:14,928
I NEVER KNEW THAT. NO.

YEAH.

425

IT'S A FUN FACT, RIGHT?

426
00:23:14,928 --> 00:23:20,066
ISN'T THIS A SWEET ONE.

427
00:23:20,066 --> 00:23:29,576
HELLO KITTY'S FAVORITE FOOD IS

428
00:23:20,066 --> 00:23:29,576

429
00:23:20,066 --> 00:23:29,576
WHY DID YOU SAY HELLO KITTY

430
00:23:29,576 --> 00:23:37,817
IS A LITTLE GIRL?

431
00:23:29,576 --> 00:23:37,817
BECAUSE ACCORDING TO THE

432
00:23:29,576 --> 00:23:37,817
CREATORS, IT WAS A HUMAN LITTLE

433
00:23:37,817 --> 00:23:41,888
GIRL.

434
00:23:37,817 --> 00:23:41,888
SO YOU'RE TELLING ME IF YOU

435
00:23:37,817 --> 00:23:41,888

LIKE HELLO KITTY, YOU WOULD

437
00:23:41,888 --> 00:23:46,326
THINK THAT WAS A REAL BABY?

438
00:23:41,888 --> 00:23:46,326
I WOULD TELL THE DOCTOR TO

439
00:23:46,326 --> 00:23:52,365
THROW IT AWAY.

440
00:23:46,326 --> 00:23:52,365
MAYBE WE SHOULD MOVE ON.

441
00:23:46,326 --> 00:23:52,365
HELLO KITTY IS IN THE THIRD

442
00:23:52,365 --> 00:23:56,836

443

HE ACTUALLY IS A CAT.

450
00:24:02,709 --> 00:24:10,483
SO THE GIRL IS A PERSON, BUT

451
00:24:10,483 --> 00:24:15,655
THE ONE IN THE SUIT AND TIE IS A

00:25:19,352 --> 00:25:25,625
ONE?

489
00:25:19,352 --> 00:25:25,625
SHE HAS AN AGE, HEIGHT, PET, AND

490
00:25:25,625 --> 00:25:30,163
RELATIONSHIP, BUT SHE'S

491
00:25:25,625 --> 00:25:30,163
RACELESS?

492
00:25:25,625 --> 00:25:30,163
IF SHE CAN BE ANYTHING, SAY

493
00:25:30,163 --> 00:25:32,232
SHE'S BLACK.

494
00:25:30,163 --> 00:25:32,232
I'M SORRY.

495
00:25:30,163 --> 00:25:32,232
EXCUSE ME?

496
00:25:32,232 --> 00:25:38,638
SAY THAT LITTLE WHITE GIRL IS BLACK.

497
00:25:32,232 --> 00:25:38,638
NO, WE'RE NOT GOING TO DO

498
00:25:38,638 --> 00:25:42,475
THAT.

499
00:25:38,638 --> 00:25:42,475
DO YOU LIKE THIS?

500
00:25:38,638 --> 00:25:42,475
CONFUSING US WITH YOUR LIES

501
00:25:42,475 --> 00:25:48,782
ABOUT HELLO KITTY HAVING SEX AND

502
00:25:42,475 --> 00:25:48,782
HOW BIG APPLES ARE?

503
00:25:42,475 --> 00:25:48,782
BECAUSE WE ONLY RECOGNIZE ONE

504
00:25:48,782 --> 00:25:53,753
BIG APPLE, NEW YORK, THE BEST

505
00:25:48,782 --> 00:25:53,753
CITY IN THE WORLD, AND WE'RE NOT

506
00:25:48,782 --> 00:25:53,753
GOING TO LET YOU RUIN IT.

507
00:25:53,753 --> 00:26:03,096
WHO'S WITH US?

508
00:25:53,753 --> 00:26:03,096
I AM.

509
00:25:53,753 --> 00:26:03,096
I AM TOO.

510
00:26:03,096 --> 00:26:10,704
BECAUSE I AM NEW YORK.

511
00:26:03,096 --> 00:26:10,704
AND I AM NEW YORK.

512
00:26:03,096 --> 00:26:10,704
AND IF YOU MESS WITH HELLO

513
00:26:10,704 --> 00:26:21,881
KITTY, YOU MESS WITH NEW YORK.

514
00:26:10,704 --> 00:26:21,881
ISN'T THAT RIGHT, HELLO

515
00:26:10,704 --> 00:26:21,881
KITTY?

516
00:26:21,881 --> 00:26:29,923
YEAH.

517
00:26:21,881 --> 00:26:29,923
JUST TELL US THE TRUTH, LADY.

518
00:26:29,923 --> 00:26:36,896
NATASHA LEON, WHAT DO YOU

519
00:26:29,923 --> 00:26:36,896
WANT?

520
00:26:29,923 --> 00:26:36,896
THIS IS NEW YORK, SO SAY THAT

521
00:26:36,896 --> 00:26:40,600
HELLO KITTY ISN'T A LITTLE HUMAN GIRL.

522
00:26:36,896 --> 00:26:40,600
SAY SHE'S A CAT.

523
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:44,871
OKAY.

524
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:44,871
FINE.

525
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:44,871
SHE'S A CAT.

526
00:26:44,871 --> 00:26:49,876
YEA!

527
00:26:44,871 --> 00:26:49,876
YEAH!

00:26:44,871 --> 00:26:49,876
NOW, COME ON, EVERYBODY.

529
00:26:49,876 --> 00:26:59,486
I GOT US ALL TICKETS TO SEE THE

SQUARE GARDEN.

532
00:26:59,486 --> 00:27:06,926
HELLO KITTY THE HUMAN?

533
00:26:59,486 --> 00:27:06,926
FORGET ABOUT IT.

534
00:27:10,846 --> 00:27:12,874
HOW

535
00:27:12,874 --> 00:27:15,913

536
00:27:15,913 --> 00:27:16,873
ONE WEEK AGO

537
00:27:16,873 --> 00:27:20,427
OH, KENAN THOMPSON, THE

538
00:27:20,427 --> 00:27:22,042

00:27:22,122 --> 00:27:25,234
- YES.
I'M WORKING WITH MY IDOL.
- STOP IT.

540
00:27:25,234 --> 00:27:28,246
NO, NO, I GREW UP WATCHING
YOU AS A KID.

541
00:27:28,246 --> 00:27:30,004
I ALWAYS WANTED TO WORK WITH
YOU.

542
00:27:30,004 --> 00:27:34,056
I ACTUALLY HAVE AN IDEA FOR A
PROJECT I WOULD LOVE TO TALK TO
YOU ABOUT LATER.

543
00:27:34,056 --> 00:27:38,642
ANYTHING WITH KEKE PALMER,
I'M THERE, NO QUESTIONS ASKED.

544
00:27:38,642 --> 00:27:41,285
REALLY?
BECAUSE I GOT THIS IDEA FOR A REBOOT

545
00:27:41,285 --> 00:27:43,953

546
00:27:44,595 --> 00:27:47,221

552
00:27:58,404 --> 00:28:01,473
I THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE
A STREAMING THEORY.

553
00:28:01,473 --> 00:28:04,735
I WOULD HAVE SAID YES TO KENAN
AND KEL, BUT NOW IT'S JUST KELLY.

554
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:07,224
SOLD BEFORE

555
00:28:07,224 --> 00:28:09,857
I TOLD THE PRODUCERS WE WROTE

00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:24,200
KELLY, I THINK THAT SALMON
YOU CAUGHT

560
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:27,033
MIGHT BE A PIRANNA.

here come the bus

562
00:28:30,588 --> 00:28:33,825

BUS

564
00:28:37,485 --> 00:28:39,229
NO BUS

565
00:28:41,144 --> 00:28:44,044
YOU CAN'T KEEP TAKING ORANGE SODAS.

566
00:28:44,044 --> 00:28:46,577
JUST PUT IT ON MY TAB.
I'M GOOD FOR IT.

567
00:28:46,577 --> 00:28:48,649
OKAY.

568

DON'T YELL AT ME BECAUSE
GUESS WHAT?

570
00:28:59,379 --> 00:29:02,622
I'M PREGNANT WITH YOUR CHILD.

571
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:08,375
KEKE WAS GUNNING FOR AN EMMY
AWARD.

572
00:29:08,375 --> 00:29:10,769
SO SHE WANTED TO BRING DRAMATIC
MOMENTS IN.

573
00:29:10,769 --> 00:29:14,537
I THOUGHT, THAT WON'T WORK, AND
I WAS RIGHT.

574
00:29:15,617 --> 00:29:18,835
KELLY, DID YOU FIX THE SLUSH
MACHINE?

575
00:29:18,835 --> 00:29:21,474
YEP.

576
00:29:21,474 --> 00:29:22,768
TRY IT OUT, KENAN.

577
00:29:22,768 --> 00:29:27,624
DON'T MIND IF I DO.
I HAVE BEEN CRAVING ONE FOR
WEEKS NOW.

578
00:29:28,698 --> 00:29:31,080
THAT'S ODD.

579
00:29:36,041 --> 00:29:38,999
KELLY!
WHY WOULD YOU TELL ME IT IS
FIXED?

580
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,258
YOU ARE SUCH AN--

581
00:29:40,258 --> 00:29:42,652
WHAT?
AN IDIOT?

582
00:29:42,652 --> 00:29:46,612
GO AHEAD.
SAY IT.
IT AIN'T LIKE I HAVEN'T HEARD IT BEFORE.

583
00:29:46,612 --> 00:29:50,256
MY MAMA USED TO GET DRUNK EVERY
DAY AND CALL ME AN IDIOT.

584
00:29:50,256 --> 00:29:55,470
CHIRAQ

585
00:29:55,470 --> 00:29:58,801
MY UNCLE TOLD HER TO BLAME ME
FOR MY DADDY LEAVING.

586
00:29:58,801 --> 00:30:01,956
HOW YOU GOING TO BLAME A LITTLE
GIRL FOR THAT MAN BEING A
COWARD?

587
00:30:01,956 --> 00:30:03,180
HOW?

588
00:30:05,017 --> 00:30:08,096
UH-OH, HERE COMES THE BUS.

589
00:30:08,096 --> 00:30:11,182
IT JUST STARTED, AND I THINK
WE HAVE A TONE ISSUE.

590
00:30:11,182 --> 00:30:14,226
BUT PEOPLE SEEM EXCITED ABOUT
IT, I GUESS.

591
00:30:14,226 --> 00:30:17,568
HEY, KENAN.
- HEY, DEVON, GOOD JOB ON THE
SONG, MAN.

592
00:30:17,628 --> 00:30:20,549
THANK YOU.
I CAN DO OTHER STUFF TOO, THOUGH.
CHECK THIS OUT.

593
00:30:29,077 --> 00:30:30,860

THANK YOU.

595
00:30:32,476 --> 00:30:35,002
I THINK WE ALREADY FOUND SOMEONE.

596
00:30:35,002 --> 00:30:36,675
HEY, EVERYBODY!

00:30:36,675 --> 00:30:38,243

OH, I MISSED YOU.

599
00:30:39,751 --> 00:30:42,436
OH, MAN, I MISSED YOU TOO!

600
00:30:46,412 --> 00:30:48,642
WHO LOVES ORANGE SODA?

601
00:30:48,642 --> 00:30:51,466
KEL LOVES ORANGE SODA.

602
00:30:51,466 --> 00:30:54,017
OH, SWEET BABY.

603
00:30:54,756 --> 00:30:58,331
KEL, IT'S BEEN SO LONG, MAN.
WHAT YOU BEEN UP TO?

604
00:30:58,331 --> 00:31:00,634
HANDS UP, EVERYBODY, THIS IS

605
00:31:00,634 --> 00:31:02,268
GIVE ME ALL THE MONEY IN THE REGISTER.

606
00:31:02,268 --> 00:31:04,580

MR. ROBBER.

607
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:06,477
YOU BEEN WONDERING WHERE I BEEN.

608
00:31:06,477 --> 00:31:10,747
I BEEN LEARNING THE ARTS OF
KARATE.

609
00:31:16,498 --> 00:31:19,429
FOOL

610
00:31:19,846 --> 00:31:21,453
KEL!

611
00:31:21,453 --> 00:31:23,959
OH, DON'T DIE ON ME, KEL.
NO.

612
00:31:23,959 --> 00:31:25,342
DON'T GO INTO THE LIGHT.

613
00:31:25,342 --> 00:31:27,263
MY BABY NEEDS HIS FATHER.

614
00:31:27,263 --> 00:31:30,385
YOU HEARD THAT RIGHT, KENAN.
KEL'S THE FATHER.

615
00:31:30,385 --> 00:31:32,731
I SLEPT WITH HIM JUST TO HURT
YOU.

616
00:31:32,731 --> 00:31:36,499
WHY DO I HURT THE ONES I LOVE
THE MOST?

617
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:40,455
BUS

618
00:31:40,455 --> 00:31:42,776
HERE IT COMES.

619
00:31:43,449 --> 00:31:45,473
NO!

620
00:31:45,473 --> 00:31:47,500
THE SHOW IS NOT GOOD.

621
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:49,538
BUT JORDAN PEEL CALLED

622
00:31:49,538 --> 00:31:52,776
AND WANTS
US TO DO A SEQUEL CALLED YEP.

623
00:31:53,922 --> 00:31:55,619
YEP

624
00:32:04,453 --> 00:32:10,797
THE AR BEE'S FIVE FOR TEN.

625
00:32:00,453 --> 00:32:10,797
THAT'S RIGHT, YOU GET FIVE

626
00:32:00,453 --> 00:32:10,797
ARBY'S SANDWICHES FOR $5.

627
00:32:10,797 --> 00:32:14,067
THAT'S FIVE STACKED SANDWICHES

628
00:32:10,797 --> 00:32:14,067
FOR JUST TEN BUCKS.

629
00:32:10,797 --> 00:32:14,067
WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO SAY ABOUT

630
00:32:14,067 --> 00:32:18,138
THAT?

631
00:32:14,067 --> 00:32:18,138
I GUESS ALL I HAVE TO SAY IS

632
00:32:14,067 --> 00:32:18,138
HOW?

633
00:32:18,138 --> 00:32:26,279
YEAH.

634
00:32:18,138 --> 00:32:26,279
THAT SEEMS LIKE A LOT OF ROAST

635
00:32:18,138 --> 00:32:26,279
BEEF SANDWICHES FOR $10.

636
00:32:26,279 --> 00:32:32,085
IT'S FIVE HEAPING PILES OF

637
00:32:26,279 --> 00:32:32,085
TENDER ROAST BEEF FOR ONLY TEN

638
00:32:26,279 --> 00:32:32,085
MEASLY DOLLARS.

639
00:32:32,085 --> 00:32:35,188
CAN YOU EVEN BELIEVE IT?

640
00:32:32,085 --> 00:32:35,188
HONESTLY, NO. YEAH.

641
00:32:35,188 --> 00:32:41,261
WE'RE STRUGGLING TO UNDERSTAND

642
00:32:35,188 --> 00:32:41,261
THE PHYSICS OF HOW THIS MUCH

643
00:32:35,188 --> 00:32:41,261
ROAST BEEF IS $10.

644
00:32:41,261 --> 00:32:49,669
BECAUSE ISN'T ONE ROAST BEEF

645
00:32:41,261 --> 00:32:49,669
SANDWICH NORMALLY AT LEAST $5?

646
00:32:41,261 --> 00:32:49,669
I BET YOU NEVER THOUGHT $10

647
00:32:49,669 --> 00:32:55,175
COULD GET YOU FIVE MOUNTAINS OF

648
00:32:49,669 --> 00:32:55,175
ROAST BEEF.

649
00:32:49,669 --> 00:32:55,175
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE

650
00:32:55,175 --> 00:33:01,715
SAYING.

651
00:32:55,175 --> 00:33:01,715
WE DON'T THINK IT'S POSSIBLE.

652
00:32:55,175 --> 00:33:01,715
I JUST GOOGLED ROAST BEEF

653
00:33:01,715 --> 00:33:08,288
PRICES AT THE GROCERY STORE, AND

654
00:33:01,715 --> 00:33:08,288
IT SELLS FOR $11 A POUND, BUT

655
00:33:01,715 --> 00:33:08,288
YOU'RE SAYING--

656
00:33:08,288 --> 00:33:14,794

659
00:33:14,794 --> 00:33:21,601
THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT.

660
00:33:14,794 --> 00:33:21,601
I KNOW BREAD IS SUPER CHEAP, BUT

661
00:33:14,794 --> 00:33:21,601
IT'S NOT NEGATIVE DOLLARS.

662
00:33:21,601 --> 00:33:30,610
ARBY'S IS A FOR-PROFIT

663
00:33:21,601 --> 00:33:30,610
BUSINESS, RIGHT?

664
00:33:21,601 --> 00:33:30,610

THAT DON'T ANSWER HIS QUESTIONS.

673
00:33:44,491 --> 00:33:50,430
WE KNOW YOU HAVE THE MEATS, BUT

674
00:33:50,430 --> 00:33:57,504

675
00:33:50,430 --> 00:33:57,504

FOUR OUNCE SODA FOR ONLY $5.

683
00:34:16,222 --> 00:34:23,229
IS THAT REAL?

684
00:34:16,222 --> 00:34:23,229

685
00:34:16,222 --> 00:34:23,229
IT'S THE $5 BOX ON AT TACO BELL.

686
00:34:23,229 --> 00:34:27,067
OKAY.

687
00:34:23,229 --> 00:34:27,067
I DON'T LIKE YOU CHANGED THE

688
00:34:23,229 --> 00:34:27,067
SUBJECT TO TACO BELL.

689
00:34:27,067 --> 00:34:30,637
NOW I'M WORRIED ABOUT THIS BOX TOO.

690
00:34:27,067 --> 00:34:30,637
WELL, ARBY'S IS LOOKING--

691
00:34:30,637 --> 00:34:37,377

A GIANT SODA FOR $5?

694
00:34:37,377 --> 00:34:42,115
HOW CAN THAT PHYSICALLY HAPPEN.

695
00:34:37,377 --> 00:34:42,115
THAT MEANS EACH FULL BURRITO IS

696
00:34:42,115 --> 00:34:48,621
LIKE 70 CENTS.

697
00:34:42,115 --> 00:34:48,621
SO ARBY'S IS LOOKING PRETTY

698
00:34:42,115 --> 00:34:48,621
GOOD BY COMPARISON, RIGHT?

699
00:34:48,621 --> 00:34:58,498
NO.

700
00:34:48,621 --> 00:34:58,498
THIS ALL SOUNDS TERRIBLE.

701
00:34:48,621 --> 00:34:58,498
I THOUGHT THE FOUR FOR FOUR MENU

702
00:34:58,498 --> 00:35:01,301

703

712
00:35:16,683 --> 00:35:24,424

WEEKEND

826
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:39,834
>>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
GOOD EVENING, EVERYONE.

827
00:39:39,834 --> 00:39:43,184
WELCOME TO WEEKEND UPDATE.
I'M MICHAEL CHE.
I'M COLIN JOST.

828
00:39:47,011 --> 00:39:48,890
WELL, YOU GUYS ARE NOT GOING TO BELIEVE THIS,

829
00:39:48,890 --> 00:39:52,297
BUT ALEX JONES AND
KANYE WEST GOT TOGETHER THIS WEEK,

830
00:39:52,297 --> 00:39:54,415
AND IT DIDN'T GO GREAT.

831
00:39:54,415 --> 00:39:58,554
KANYE WEST MADE ANTI-SEMITIC
JOKES AND SAID, I LIKE HITLER,

832
00:39:58,554 --> 00:40:02,869
WHICH IS ALSO THE PASS WORD HE
USED TO GET INTO MAR-A-LAGO.

833
00:40:02,869 --> 00:40:07,623
AT THIS POINT, I DON'T THINK
KANYE IS OFF HIS MEDS SO MUCH AS
HE'S IMMUNE TO THEM.

834
00:40:07,623 --> 00:40:11,295
WE'RE BASICALLY DEALING WITH THE
OMICRON VARIANT OF KANYE.

835
00:40:11,295 --> 00:40:13,236
WE THOUGHT HE WOULD FADE AWAY,

836
00:40:13,236 --> 00:40:17,640
BUT NOW WE REALIZE WE MAY HAVE
TO LIVE WITH THE BRAIN FOG OF
LONG HAUL KANYE.

837
00:40:17,641 --> 00:40:20,377
STUFF

838
00:40:20,377 --> 00:40:22,581
IF JEWS DO CONTROL THE MEDIA,

839
00:40:22,581 --> 00:40:26,642
HOW ARE WE STILL SEEING A NEW
INTERVIEW WITH KANYE EVERY DAY.

840
00:40:26,642 --> 00:40:29,081
ALSO IF THEY CONTROL THE MEDIA,

841
00:40:29,081 --> 00:40:32,884
EXPLAIN THE 80 FOOT CHRISTMAS
TREE OUTSIDE OF NBC.

842
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:35,823
>>> PRESIDENT BIDEN SIGNED A MEASURE

843
00:40:35,823 --> 00:40:40,171
THAT WOULD FORCE RAILWAY
WORKERS TO AVERT A STRIKE,

844
00:40:40,171 --> 00:40:42,409
BUT
DOES NOT GET SICK LEAVE.

845
00:40:42,409 --> 00:40:44,602
HOW DO YOU EXPECT BIDEN TO CARE
ABOUT SICK LEAVE

846
00:40:44,602 --> 00:40:49,120
WHEN HE SHOWS
UP TO WORK EVERY DAY WITH FULL
BLOWN CTE.

847
00:40:50,722 --> 00:40:53,657
ACT

848
00:40:53,657 --> 00:40:56,957
IT SOLIDIFIES MARRIAGE
PROTECTION FOR INTERRACIAL
MARRIAGES.

849
00:40:56,957 --> 00:40:58,909
BUT IF I MARRY A WHITE LADY,

850
00:40:58,909 --> 00:41:01,534
WHO'S GOING TO PROTECT ME FROM
MY MOTHER?

851
00:41:05,278 --> 00:41:08,908
THE GEORGIA SENATE RUNOFF SET
RECORDS FOR EARLY VOTING.

852
00:41:08,908 --> 00:41:12,963
HERSCHEL WALKER HAS ALWAYS
ENCOURAGED HIS SUPPORTERS TO
TAKE CARE OF VOTING EARLY

853
00:41:12,963 --> 00:41:15,310
BEFORE
IT BECOMES A PROBLEM.

854
00:41:15,591 --> 00:41:18,023
OH, MAN.

855
00:41:18,023 --> 00:41:21,107
PRESIDENT BIDEN HAS RECOMMENDED
THAT SOUTH CAROLINA

856
00:41:21,107 --> 00:41:24,627
BECOME THE
FIRST STATE TO VOTE IN THE
DEMOCRATIC PRIMARIES

857
00:41:24,627 --> 00:41:28,783
TO GIVE
BLACK VOTERS MORE OF A VOICE IN
SELECTING THE 2024 CANDIDATE.

858
00:41:28,783 --> 00:41:32,287
NOT TO BE OUTDONE, DONALD TRUMP
ALSO PLANS TO GIVE VOTERS A VOICE

859
00:41:32,287 --> 00:41:34,212
WITH THIS BLACK PUPPET.

860
00:41:38,876 --> 00:41:43,895
THERE IS GROWING SUPPORT TO
MOVE THE FIRST DEMOCRATIC
PRIMARY FROM IOWA SO SOUTH CAROLINA,

861
00:41:43,895 --> 00:41:46,266
BUT WHY MOVE IT TO
ANOTHER BORING STATE?

862
00:41:46,266 --> 00:41:50,023
START THE PRIMARIES WITH A BANG
IN FLORIDA.

863
00:41:50,023 --> 00:41:54,341
RIGHT?
INSTEAD OF WATCHING A POLITICIAN
EAT A CORN DOG AT THE IOWA STATE FAIR,

864
00:41:54,341 --> 00:41:56,869
IMAGINE SMOKING METH,

865
00:41:56,869 --> 00:41:59,334
SHIRTLESS AT GATOR LAND

866
00:41:59,334 --> 00:42:04,690
AS HE BATTLES FOR THE STATE'S KEY
DEMOGRAPHIC, GRANDMAS UNDER 30.

867
00:42:05,551 --> 00:42:11,719
RIGHT?
YOU KNOW, AT THE END OF THE DAY,
FLORIDA MAY NOT GIVE US FDR OR JFK,

868
00:42:11,719 --> 00:42:14,736
BUT IT WILL DEFINITELY GIVE
US HPV.

869
00:42:16,157 --> 00:42:20,180
A FEDERAL JURY HAS FOUND THE
OATH KEEPERS LEADER

870
00:42:20,180 --> 00:42:24,211
GUILTY OF
SEDITIOUS CONSPIRACY.

871
00:42:24,211 --> 00:42:27,757
HE PLANS TO APPEAL THE VERDICT
BECAUSE HE FEELS THAT THE TRIAL
LIKE HIS VISION

872
00:42:27,757 --> 00:42:30,226
WAS VERY
ONE-SIDED.

873
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:38,947
QUESTIONS ARE BEING RAISED
ABOUT VLADIMIR PUTIN'S HEALTH

874
00:42:38,947 --> 00:42:42,731
AFTER HE FELL DOWN THE STAIRS AT
HIS HOME AND SOILED HIMSELF.

875
00:42:42,731 --> 00:42:46,149
QUESTIONS LIKE IS THERE A VIDEO?

876
00:42:47,422 --> 00:42:52,870
AN APPLE FACTORY IN CHINA IS
EXPECTED TO CUT iPHONES BY 6 MILLION

877
00:42:52,870 --> 00:42:55,477
IN RESPONSE TO WORKER
PROTESTS.

878
00:42:55,477 --> 00:42:59,031
THEIR MAIN DEMAND IS MORE PLAY TIME.

879
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:06,921
I'M SHOCKED TOO.

880
00:43:08,264 --> 00:43:12,992
IT WAS ANNOUNCED THAT KIM
KARDASHIAN AND KANYE WEST HAVE
REACHED A SETTLEMENT IN THEIR DIVORCE,

881
00:43:12,992 --> 00:43:16,991
AND I'M GOING TO GO OUT
ON A LIMB AND SUGGEST THAT SHE
HAD AN EASIER TIME

882
00:43:16,991 --> 00:43:19,220
FINDING A
A GOOD LAWYER.

883
00:43:26,150 --> 00:43:29,242
IT'S THE HOLIDAY SEASON, WHICH

884
00:43:24,437 --> 00:43:29,242
CAN BE ESPECIALLY TOUGH FOR

885
00:43:29,242 --> 00:43:37,650
CHILDREN OF DIVORCE.

886
00:43:29,242 --> 00:43:37,650
HERE TO COMMENT IS CHILD OF

887
00:43:29,242 --> 00:43:37,650
DIVORCE MICHAEL LONGFELLOW.

888
00:43:37,650 --> 00:43:43,957
HAPPY HOLIDAYS, EVERYONE.

889
00:43:37,650 --> 00:43:43,957
HAPPY HOLIDAYS, MICHAEL.

890
00:43:37,650 --> 00:43:43,957
SO YOUR PARENTS ARE DIVORCED.

891
00:43:43,957 --> 00:43:48,194
IS THAT HARD FOR SNU. NO.

892
00:43:43,957 --> 00:43:48,194
I WAS A TINY BABY.

893
00:43:48,194 --> 00:43:53,566
I HAVE NO MEMORY OF THEM BEING TOGETHER.

894
00:43:48,194 --> 00:43:53,566
UNTIL I GOT OLDER, I WASN'T SURE

895
00:43:53,566 --> 00:43:58,838
THEY KNEW EACH OTHER.

896
00:43:53,566 --> 00:43:58,838
I HAD A CHILD TELL ME, YOU KNOW

897
00:43:53,566 --> 00:43:58,838
YOUR PARENTS HAD SEX TO HAVE

898
00:43:58,838 --> 00:44:02,909
YOU, AND I WAS LIKE, I DON'T

899
00:43:58,838 --> 00:44:02,909
KNOW THAT THEY'VE MET, SO THAT'S

900
00:43:58,838 --> 00:44:02,909
STUPID.

901
00:44:02,909 --> 00:44:10,150
WELL, SURELY YOU WERE AWARE

902
00:44:02,909 --> 00:44:10,150
AT SOME POINT THEY MET.

903
00:44:02,909 --> 00:44:10,150
I WASN'T, AND DON'T CALL ME

904
00:44:10,150 --> 00:44:14,487
SHIRLEY.

905
00:44:10,150 --> 00:44:14,487
IT'S NOT SNAKES ON A PLANE.

906
00:44:10,150 --> 00:44:14,487
I HONESTLY, THE HOLIDAYS MUST

907
00:44:14,487 --> 00:44:17,857
HAVE BEEN MORE DIFFICULT WITH

908
00:44:14,487 --> 00:44:17,857
DIVORCED PARENTS.

909
00:44:14,487 --> 00:44:17,857
I DISAGREE.

910
00:44:17,857 --> 00:44:23,263
THERE ARE PERKS TO HAVING

911
00:44:17,857 --> 00:44:23,263
PARENTS ALWAYS GETTING MARRIED

912
00:44:17,857 --> 00:44:23,263
AND DIVORCED AND MARRIED AGAIN.

913
00:44:23,263 --> 00:44:30,804
YOU EVER ASK FOR A BROTHER FOR

914
00:44:23,263 --> 00:44:30,804
CHRISTMAS AND ACTUALLY GET ONE?

915
00:44:23,263 --> 00:44:30,804
I HAVE AND I DIDN'T HAVE TO WAIT

916
00:44:30,804 --> 00:44:35,709
FOR HIM TO GROW UP.

917
00:44:30,804 --> 00:44:35,709
WE CAME OFF THE SHELF READY TO GO.

918
00:44:35,709 --> 00:44:39,079
WE WERE PLAYING CATCH THAT DAY.

919
00:44:35,709 --> 00:44:39,079
THAT MUST HAVE BEEN NICE.

920
00:44:35,709 --> 00:44:39,079
IT WAS.

921
00:44:39,079 --> 00:44:48,121
AND BROTHERS IS NOT THE ONLY

922
00:44:39,079 --> 00:44:48,121
THING DIVORCE HAS GIVEN ME.

923
00:44:39,079 --> 00:44:48,121
IT'S GIVEN ME SISTERS, BROTHERS,

924
00:44:48,121 --> 00:44:55,995
DADS, AND YOU GOT MY NEWEST DAD

925
00:44:48,121 --> 00:44:55,995
KERRY WHO'S A SEMINUDIST I'VE

926
00:44:48,121 --> 00:44:55,995
SEEN NAKED 43 TIMES.

927
00:44:55,995 --> 00:45:01,267
WHEN YOU SEE YOUR MOM'S

928
00:44:55,995 --> 00:45:01,267
BOYFRIEND NAKED, YOU THINK A LOT

929
00:44:55,995 --> 00:45:01,267
OF THINGS, BUT YOU DON'T THINK

930
00:45:01,267 --> 00:45:05,939
IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN 42 MORE TIMES.

931
00:45:01,267 --> 00:45:05,939
WELL, I AT LEAST HOPE HE HAS

932
00:45:05,939 --> 00:45:13,146
A NICE BODY.

933
00:45:05,939 --> 00:45:13,146
WHY?

934
00:45:05,939 --> 00:45:13,146
YOU KNOW WHAT, I DON'T KNOW.

935
00:45:13,146 --> 00:45:17,317
NEVER MIND.

936
00:45:13,146 --> 00:45:17,317
ARE YOU SAYING YOU'RE THEN

937
00:45:13,146 --> 00:45:17,317
PRO-DIVORCE?

938
00:45:17,317 --> 00:45:21,955
WELL, MY DAD IS A DIVORCE

939
00:45:17,317 --> 00:45:21,955
ATTORNEY, SO PUT FOOD ON MY TABLE.

940
00:45:21,955 --> 00:45:27,160
SO YOUR FATHER IS A DIVORCED

941
00:45:21,955 --> 00:45:27,160
ATTORNEY WHO'S ALSO BEEN

942
00:45:21,955 --> 00:45:27,160
DIVORCED?

943
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:34,567
MULTIPLE TIMES.

944
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:34,567
I MEAN, THIS GUY WALKS THE WALK.

945
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:34,567
IS HE A BAD HUSBAND OR A

946
00:45:34,567 --> 00:45:37,871
WORKAHOLIC?

947
00:45:34,567 --> 00:45:37,871
HE'S AN ARTIST.

948
00:45:34,567 --> 00:45:37,871
BUT HE WAS STILL A GREAT DAY.

949
00:45:37,871 --> 00:45:44,611
HE TOLD ME EVERYTHING A KID

950
00:45:37,871 --> 00:45:44,611
SHOULD KNOW, BRUSH YOUR TEETH,

951
00:45:37,871 --> 00:45:44,611
DO YOUR HOMEWORK, IF INFIDELITY

952
00:45:44,611 --> 00:45:49,916
CAN'T BE PROVEN, THEY'RE ONLY

953
00:45:44,611 --> 00:45:49,916
ENTITLED TO 30%.

954
00:45:44,611 --> 00:45:49,916
AND IT'S NOT EASY TO PROVE IN A

955
00:45:49,916 --> 00:45:53,486
COURT OF LAW.

956
00:45:49,916 --> 00:45:53,486
TEXT MESSAGES AREN'T GOOD ENOUGH.

957
00:45:53,486 --> 00:45:57,791
GOOD TO KNOW.

958
00:45:53,486 --> 00:45:57,791
SO IT SOUNDS LIKE YOUR DAD

959
00:45:53,486 --> 00:45:57,791
ENJOYS HIS WORK.

960
00:45:57,791 --> 00:46:02,929
ABSOLUTELY.

961
00:45:57,791 --> 00:46:02,929
IN FACT, HE MET HIS CURRENT WIFE

962
00:45:57,791 --> 00:46:02,929
BECAUSE HE HANDLED HER DIVORCE.

963
00:46:02,929 --> 00:46:06,433
SOME SAY THAT'S A CONFLICT OF INTEREST.

964
00:46:02,929 --> 00:46:06,433
I JUST SAY HE'S GOT THAT

965
00:46:06,433 --> 00:46:13,406
DOG HIM.

966
00:46:06,433 --> 00:46:13,406
MICHAEL LONGFELLOW, EVERYONE.

967
00:46:06,433 --> 00:46:13,406
AND DON'T CALL ME SHIRLEY.

1043
00:49:18,224 --> 00:49:25,131
WHAT ARE THE CHARACTERS LIKE?

1044
00:49:18,224 --> 00:49:25,131

1045
00:49:18,224 --> 00:49:25,131
TWO DADDIES, AND ONE'S A DOCTOR,

1046
00:49:25,131 --> 00:49:29,569

00:49:29,569 --> 00:49:35,542

1050
00:49:29,569 --> 00:49:35,542
UNTIL THEY ANALLY ENTER EACH

1051
00:49:35,542 --> 00:49:40,613
OTHER.

1052
00:49:35,542 --> 00:49:40,613
WHAT?

1053
00:49:35,542 --> 00:49:40,613
COME ON, MICHAEL.

1054
00:49:40,613 --> 00:49:44,417
SURE.

1055
00:49:40,613 --> 00:49:44,417
IN THE FIRST EPISODE, THEY MAKE SPAGHETTI.

1056
00:49:44,417 --> 00:49:49,556
BUT YOU KNOW AS SOON AS THOSE

1057
00:49:44,417 --> 00:49:49,556
PLATES ARE CLEARED, THEY'RE

1058
00:49:44,417 --> 00:49:49,556
ANALLY ENTERING EACH OTHER, AND

1059
00:49:49,556 --> 00:49:55,895
ONE IS A DOCTOR, SO HE KNOWS

1060
00:49:49,556 --> 00:49:55,895
JUST WHERE IT GOES.

1061
00:49:49,556 --> 00:49:55,895
TRISH, I DON'T THINK THAT'S

1062
00:49:55,895 --> 00:50:01,368
GOING TO HAPPEN ON THE SHOW.

1063
00:49:55,895 --> 00:50:01,368
OH, I KNOW.

1064
00:49:55,895 --> 00:50:01,368
IT WILL BE SOMETHING INNOCENT

1065
00:50:01,368 --> 00:50:06,072
LIKE TEACH PEPPA HOW TO RIDE A BIKE.

1066
00:50:01,368 --> 00:50:06,072
THAT'S NICE.

1067
00:50:06,072 --> 00:50:12,612
AND ONCE PEPPA HAS THE HANG

1068
00:50:06,072 --> 00:50:12,612

1069
00:50:06,072 --> 00:50:12,612

1070
00:50:12,612 --> 00:50:18,585
BEHIND A BUSH AND ANALLY ENTER

1071
00:50:12,612 --> 00:50:18,585
EACH OTHER.

1072
00:50:12,612 --> 00:50:18,585
I THINK THIS SHOW IS

1073
00:50:18,585 --> 00:50:23,523
REFLECTING THAT GAY PEOPLE EXIST

1074
00:50:18,585 --> 00:50:23,523
AND IT'S JUST A PART OF LIFE.

1075
00:50:18,585 --> 00:50:23,523
IT'S NOT A PART OF LIFE.

1076
00:50:23,523 --> 00:50:27,327
IT HURTS.

1077
00:50:23,523 --> 00:50:27,327
WHAT DOES?

1078
00:50:23,523 --> 00:50:27,327
I TRIED IT.

1079
00:50:27,327 --> 00:50:35,135
IT HURTS, AND IT HURTS.

1080
00:50:27,327 --> 00:50:35,135
AND THEY'RE POLAR BEARS, SO YOU

1081
00:50:27,327 --> 00:50:35,135
KNOW IT'S LIKE THIS BIG.

1082
00:50:35,135 --> 00:50:40,807
IMAGINE THAT IN YOU.

1083
00:50:35,135 --> 00:50:40,807
TRISH, I THINK YOU NEED TO

1084
00:50:35,135 --> 00:50:40,807
CALM DOWN.

1085
00:50:40,807 --> 00:50:45,545
I CAN'T.

1086
00:50:40,807 --> 00:50:45,545
I'VE TRIED EVERYTHING.

1087
00:50:40,807 --> 00:50:45,545
I'VE TRIED MEDITATION, POPPERS,

1088
00:50:45,545 --> 00:50:51,017
IT STILL HURTS.

1089
00:50:45,545 --> 00:50:51,017
AND THERE'S ANOTHER EPISODE

1090
00:50:45,545 --> 00:50:51,017
WHERE--

1091
00:50:51,017 --> 00:50:57,057
OH, TRISH, PLEASE.

1092
00:50:51,017 --> 00:50:57,057
AND THERE'S ANOTHER EPISODE

1093
00:50:51,017 --> 00:50:57,057
WHERE PEPPA IS HAVING TROUBLE

1094
00:50:57,057 --> 00:51:04,864
WITH HER MATH HOMEWORK, SO THE

1095
00:50:57,057 --> 00:51:04,864
BIGGER POLAR BEAR, THE MORE

1096
00:50:57,057 --> 00:51:04,864
MASCULINE ONE, SAYS LET'S GO

1097
00:51:04,864 --> 00:51:11,938
UPSTAIRS AND GET OUR CALCULATOR,

1098
00:51:04,864 --> 00:51:11,938
BUT THEY NEVER COME BACK.

1099
00:51:04,864 --> 00:51:11,938
AND YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT THEY

1100
00:51:11,938 --> 00:51:17,344
WERE DOING UP THERE?

1101
00:51:11,938 --> 00:51:17,344
ANALLY ENTERING EACH OTHER. SHOWERING.

1102
00:51:17,344 --> 00:51:23,116
OH, OKAY.

1103
00:51:17,344 --> 00:51:23,116
TO GET READY TO ANALLY ENTER

1104
00:51:17,344 --> 00:51:23,116
EACH OTHER BECAUSE IT'S A

1105
00:51:23,116 --> 00:51:27,554
PROCESS.

1106
00:51:23,116 --> 00:51:27,554
HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?

1107
00:51:23,116 --> 00:51:27,554
I GOOGLED IT.

1108
00:51:27,554 --> 00:51:30,623
IT'S SICK.

1109
00:51:27,554 --> 00:51:30,623
THEN DON'T LET YOUR KIDS WATCH.

1110
00:51:30,623 --> 00:51:32,692
I DON'T HAVE KIDS. ANYMORE.

1111
00:51:30,623 --> 00:51:32,692
ANYMORE?

1112
00:51:32,692 --> 00:51:37,464
THEY GREW UP, AND I DON'T

1113
00:51:32,692 --> 00:51:37,464
KNOW WHERE THEY ARE.

1114
00:51:32,692 --> 00:51:37,464
TRISH, THIS IS ALL IN YOUR

1115
00:51:37,464 --> 00:51:40,200
HEAD.

1116
00:51:37,464 --> 00:51:40,200
THE SHOW WILL NEVER SHOW ANY OF THAT.

1117
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:45,638
THAT'S WHY I ANIMATED MY OWN,

1118
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:45,638
SO EVERYONE CAN SEE EXACTLY WHAT

1119
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:45,638
I'M TALKING ABOUT.

1120
00:51:45,638 --> 00:51:49,242
WELL, THE BIG ONE IS THE BOTTOM.

1121
00:51:45,638 --> 00:51:49,242
THAT'S GOOD.

1122
00:51:49,242 --> 00:51:55,315
THAT'S THE TWIST.

1123
00:51:49,242 --> 00:51:55,315
I'M SORRY.

1124
00:51:49,242 --> 00:51:55,315
I HATE TO INTERRUPT.

1125
00:51:55,315 --> 00:52:04,791
WHO ARE YOU?

1126
00:51:55,315 --> 00:52:04,791
IT'S OKAY.

1127
00:51:55,315 --> 00:52:04,791
I ACTUALLY WATCH THIS SHOW, AND

1128
00:52:04,791 --> 00:52:08,962
IT'S TWO POLAR BEAR MOMMYS, NOT

1129
00:52:04,791 --> 00:52:08,962
TWO DADDIES.

1130
00:52:04,791 --> 00:52:08,962
WHAT?

1131
00:52:08,962 --> 00:52:13,533
NOW I HAVE TO GOOGLE THAT?

1132
00:52:08,962 --> 00:52:13,533
NO, NO.

1133
00:52:08,962 --> 00:52:13,533
IT'S LIKE--

1134
00:52:13,533 --> 00:52:18,672
UH-HUH.

1135
00:52:13,533 --> 00:52:18,672
OH, SO IT'S JUST MASHING AND

1136
00:52:13,533 --> 00:52:18,672
MUSHING?

1137
00:52:18,672 --> 00:52:25,545
THAT'S FINE.

1138
00:52:18,672 --> 00:52:25,545
I'VE DONE THAT.

1139
00:52:18,672 --> 00:52:25,545
TRISH DALE, EVERYBODY.

1140
00:52:34,821 --> 00:52:40,093
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY, THE

1141
00:52:34,821 --> 00:52:40,093
12th MONTH OF PREGNANCY IS

1142
00:52:34,821 --> 00:52:40,093
ALWAYS THE HARDEST.

1143
00:52:40,093 --> 00:52:46,933

01:05:02,869 --> 01:05:09,275
EARLIER, BUT LET ME NOT BECAUSE

1479
01:05:02,869 --> 01:05:09,275
YOU'RE TRYING TO WATCH PORN.

1480
01:05:02,869 --> 01:05:09,275
THE ENGINE ISN'T STARTING?

1481
01:05:09,275 --> 01:05:13,680
NOPE.

1482
01:05:09,275 --> 01:05:13,680

1483
01:05:09,275 --> 01:05:13,680

1484
01:05:13,680 --> 01:05:16,716
OFF.

1485
01:05:13,680 --> 01:05:16,716
NOBODY KNOWS WHERE IT'S FROM OR

1486
01:05:13,680 --> 01:05:16,716
WHERE IT GOES.

1487
01:05:16,716 --> 01:05:21,454
AND THAT'S A LONG-ASS SCREW,

1488
01:05:16,716 --> 01:05:21,454
SO YOU KNOW IT'S ESSENTIAL.

1489
01:05:16,716 --> 01:05:21,454
WHAT?

1490
01:05:21,454 --> 01:05:25,392
OH, MY GOSH!

1492
01:05:21,454 --> 01:05:25,392
WHAT JUST HAPPENED?

1493
01:05:25,392 --> 01:05:31,064

1494
01:05:25,392 --> 01:05:31,064

1495
01:05:25,392 --> 01:05:31,064

1496

1497
01:05:31,064 --> 01:05:38,271
Y'ALL DON'T NEED TO DO ALL

1498
01:05:38,271 --> 01:05:48,515

1499
01:05:38,271 --> 01:05:48,515

01:05:55,722 --> 01:05:58,625

1505
01:05:55,722 --> 01:05:58,625
WAIT A MINUTE.

1506
01:05:55,722 --> 01:05:58,625
IT'S PAST MIDNIGHT.

1507
01:05:58,625 --> 01:06:05,265
THAT MEANS IT'S YOUR BIRTHDAY.

1508

WELL, NOBODY'S GOING TO BE

1515
01:06:10,403 --> 01:06:13,440
ABLE TO SLEEP NOW.

1516
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:16,176
