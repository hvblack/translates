1
00:00:01,142 --> 00:00:05,803
>>> THIS WEEK, "THE NEW YORK
TIMES" BROKE THE STORY OF AN
EXPLOSIVE TRUMP CABINET MEETING

2
00:00:05,803 --> 00:00:09,512
WHICH ENDED IN A SHOUTING MATCH
BETWEEN MARCO RUBIO AND ELON MUSK,

3
00:00:09,512 --> 00:00:12,128
RUINING WHAT HAS BEEN AN
OTHERWISE REMARKABLY COOL

4
00:00:12,128 --> 00:00:14,599
AND
SMOOTH START TO THE TRUMP
PRESIDENCY.

5
00:00:14,599 --> 00:00:16,230
WE NOW TAKE YOU TO THE OVAL OFFICE

6
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:19,357
AS PRESIDENT TRUMP TRIES
TO BROKER A TRUCE.

7
00:00:23,007 --> 00:00:25,492
>> MARCO, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR
COMING.

8
00:00:25,492 --> 00:00:27,402
I KNOW YOU'RE UNDER A LOT OF STRESS,

9
00:00:27,402 --> 00:00:29,795
BUT I CAN'T HAVE YOU
FIGHTING WITH ELON, OKAY?

10
00:00:29,795 --> 00:00:32,967
I NEED YOU TO BE MY GOOD LITTLE
MARCO.

11
00:00:32,967 --> 00:00:37,113
>> MR. TRUMP, IF YOU THINK I'M
GOING TO STAND HERE AND LET YOU
CALL ME THAT?

12
00:00:37,113 --> 00:00:38,553
YOU'RE RIGHT.

13
00:00:38,553 --> 00:00:39,945
>> GOOD BOY.

14
00:00:39,945 --> 00:00:42,645
WE LOVE TO SAY, MARCO RUBIO.

15
00:00:42,645 --> 00:00:46,720
BUT UNFORTUNATELY, I JUST MADE
ENGLISH THE OFFICIAL LANGUAGE.

16
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:49,921
SO NOW YOUR NAME IS MARK RUBY.

17
00:00:49,921 --> 00:00:51,985
>> I ACCEPT THAT.

18
00:00:51,985 --> 00:00:56,438
BUT WHAT I DON'T ACCEPT IS ELON
HAVING TOTAL ACCESS TO OUR
GOVERNMENT.

19
00:00:56,438 --> 00:01:00,493
PLANES ARE CRASHING, AND HE
KEEPS TRYING TO FIRE AIR TRAFFIC
CONTROLLERS.

20
00:01:00,493 --> 00:01:02,686
>> WELL, ELON KNOWS ABOUT LOT
ABOUT AIR TRAVEL.

21
00:01:02,686 --> 00:01:06,112
HE RUNS SPACEX, WHICH IS DOING INCREDIBLE THINGS

22
00:01:06,112 --> 00:01:08,550
IN TERMS OF
EXPLOSIONS.

23
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:12,156
AND WITH REGARD TO ROCKET
DEBRIS.

24
00:01:12,156 --> 00:01:15,542
>> WELL, JUST BECAUSE ELON IS A
SUCCESSFUL BUSINESSMAN

25
00:01:15,542 --> 00:01:17,309
DOESN'T
MEAN HE SHOULD RUN THE COUNTRY.

26
00:01:17,309 --> 00:01:21,556
>> YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.
WE TRIED THAT IN 2016, AND IT
DIDN'T WORK.

27
00:01:21,556 --> 00:01:24,252
TRUMP 45, NOT A GREAT PRESIDENT.

28
00:01:24,252 --> 00:01:26,404
BUT NOW WE'VE GOT TRUMP 47.

29
00:01:26,404 --> 00:01:28,758
I'M OLDER.
WISER.

30
00:01:28,758 --> 00:01:30,771
AND, FRANKLY, OLDER.

31
00:01:30,771 --> 00:01:33,890
BUT ELON'S BEEN DOING GOOD JOB
WITH DOGE.

32
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:37,243
AND HE GAVE ME SOME GREAT STUFF
TO TALK ABOUT AT STATE OF THE
UNION.

33
00:01:37,243 --> 00:01:42,161
YOU KNOW, THEY'RE SPENDING $8
MILLION ON MAKING MICE
TRANSGENDER.

34
00:01:42,161 --> 00:01:43,554
CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT?

35
00:01:43,554 --> 00:01:45,679
PROBABLY NOT BECAUSE IT'S NOT
TRUE.

36
00:01:45,679 --> 00:01:50,455
BUT I SAID IT, AND IT GOT A BIG
LAUGH, AND THAT IS ADDICTIVE.

37
00:01:50,455 --> 00:01:53,821
BUT YOU'RE DOING A GREAT JOB
TOO, MARCO, OKAY?

38
00:01:53,821 --> 00:01:55,399
YOU'RE DOING GREAT, YOU'RE THE
GOAT.

39
00:01:55,399 --> 00:02:00,646
YOU'RE THE SCAPEGOAT.
BUT IT'S STILL A TYPE OF GOAD.

40
00:02:00,646 --> 00:02:03,383
>> THAT IS AN HONOR, SIR.

41
00:02:03,383 --> 00:02:06,417
BUT WHILE WE'VE BEEN CAUSING CHAOS,

42
00:02:06,417 --> 00:02:08,813
I'VE BEEN WORKING BEHIND THE SCENES,

43
00:02:08,813 --> 00:02:12,369
AND I AM VERY CLOSE
TO A DEAL WITH THE PANAMANIAN GOVERNMENT

44
00:02:12,369 --> 00:02:14,678
TO RETAKE THE PANAMA
CANAL.

45
00:02:14,678 --> 00:02:18,126
>> YEAH, I DON'T WANT IT
ANYMORE.

46
00:02:18,126 --> 00:02:20,658
SEEMS LIKE A HASSLE.

47
00:02:20,658 --> 00:02:24,531
WHAT I'D REALLY LOVE IS
THAILAND.
OKAY?

48
00:02:24,898 --> 00:02:30,425
'CAUSE I'VE BEEN WATCHING "WHITE
LOTUS," AND IT LOOKS BEAUTIFUL,
RIGHT?

49
00:02:30,425 --> 00:02:33,929
HOW ABOUT THE GIRL WITH THE
TEETH?
I DON'T MIND IT.

50
00:02:34,486 --> 00:02:36,846
SO, THAILAND?

51
00:02:37,596 --> 00:02:40,667
>> IF I MAY, SIR, AND THIS IS
VERY IMPORTANT,

52
00:02:40,667 --> 00:02:44,000
AMERICA'S
FOREIGN POLICY HAS A LONG,
DELICATE HISTORY.

53
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,149
WE CANNOT AFFORD TO --

54
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:49,194
>> SO BORING.
THIS GUY CAN'T STOP TALKING.

55
00:02:49,194 --> 00:02:52,517
I MEAN, WHO THE HELL DOES HE
THINK HE, ADRIEN BRODY?

56
00:02:52,517 --> 00:02:55,781
WEIRD-LOOKING GUY, HE KIND OF
LOOKS LIKE LUIGI.

57
00:02:55,781 --> 00:02:58,199
WE LIKE TO SAY WALA-LUIGI.

58
00:02:58,199 --> 00:02:59,789
WHAT IS THIS?

59
00:02:59,789 --> 00:03:03,483
I'M THINKING SOMETHING AND NOT
SAYING IT OUT LOUD.

60
00:03:03,483 --> 00:03:05,853
WHOA, THIS IS A WHOLE NEW THING.

61
00:03:05,853 --> 00:03:09,035
THIS IS CRAZY.
THIS CAN SAVE ME A LOT OF
TROUBLE.

62
00:03:09,035 --> 00:03:10,721
I SHOULD DO THIS MORE OFTEN.

63
00:03:10,721 --> 00:03:13,659
I WON'T, BUT I SHOULD.

64
00:03:14,247 --> 00:03:18,571
>> AND MAINTAIN AMERICA'S
STANDING IN THE GLOBAL
COMMUNITY.

65
00:03:18,571 --> 00:03:19,669
>> BAH.

66
00:03:19,669 --> 00:03:23,903
WELL.
LET'S GET ELON IN HERE SO YOU
GUYS CAN WORK THINGS OUT.

67
00:03:23,903 --> 00:03:25,615
ELON?

68
00:03:36,332 --> 00:03:38,358
>> MY, IT'S ME, TECH SUPPORT.

69
00:03:38,358 --> 00:03:40,066
HA HA HA, JUST KIDDING!

70
00:03:41,316 --> 00:03:45,501
>> ELON, I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR
AT LEAST WEARING A SUIT THIS
TIME.

71
00:03:45,501 --> 00:03:47,511
DOESN'T LOOK GREAT, RIGHT?

72
00:03:47,511 --> 00:03:50,512
BILLIONAIRE, BUT HE SHOPS AT
JOSEPH A. BANK.

73
00:03:50,512 --> 00:03:52,686
HE'S GIVING GROOMSMAN.

74
00:03:52,686 --> 00:03:54,860
GOOD ONE

75
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:57,740
GLITCH!
BUFFERING!

76
00:04:00,389 --> 00:04:02,379
HA HA, I'M BACK, I'M BACK, I'M
BACK.

77
00:04:02,379 --> 00:04:04,200
>> NEVER GOING TO GET USED TO
THAT.

78
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:07,137
NOW, LOOK, I CAN'T HAVE YOU TWO
AT EACH OTHER'S THROATS, OKAY?

79
00:04:07,137 --> 00:04:09,430
AFTER ALL, I HAVE A PERFECT
RECORD.

80
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:13,278
EVERYONE WHO'S EVER WORKED FOR
ME HAS LEFT ON GOOD TERMS.

81
00:04:13,278 --> 00:04:17,240
AND THEN GONE ON TO WRITE A BOOK
CALLED, "THE MAN WHO RUINED
EVERYTHING."

82
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:21,857
SO YOU TWO NEED TO START ACTING
LIKE MATURE ADULTS, OKAY?

83
00:04:21,857 --> 00:04:25,215
SO LET'S BEGIN WITH MARCO.
>> POLO.

84
00:04:25,744 --> 00:04:30,432
>> NO, ELON.
I'M TRYING TO TALK TO MARCO.
>> POLO!

85
00:04:32,005 --> 00:04:34,322
>> WHAT IS THAT, WHAT'S THIS,
WHAT'S THIS?

86
00:04:34,322 --> 00:04:36,015
YOU DO THIS, WHAT'S THIS?

87
00:04:36,015 --> 00:04:39,319
>> NOBODY KNOWS, OKAY?
LITTLE DANCE, WE LET HIM DO IT,
ALL RIGHT?

88
00:04:39,319 --> 00:04:41,612
HE'S A BRIEF, UNSETTLING TRICK.

89
00:04:41,612 --> 00:04:46,064
>> I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS IS THE
GUY YOU'VE GIVEN ACCESS TO THE
ENTIRE GOVERNMENT.

90
00:04:46,064 --> 00:04:47,893
HE'S NOT AN ELECTED OFFICIAL.

91
00:04:47,893 --> 00:04:52,317
>> I KNOW YOU ARE, BUT WHAT AM
I?

92
00:04:53,699 --> 00:04:55,594
COME ON

93
00:04:55,594 --> 00:04:57,013
THAT'S ENOUGH.

94
00:04:57,013 --> 00:05:00,023
IF YOU'RE GOING TO INSULT EACH
OTHER, AT LEAST MAKE THEM GOOD.

95
00:05:00,023 --> 00:05:01,373
SOMETHING LIKE --

96
00:05:01,373 --> 00:05:05,020
ELON, HOW DO YOU HAVE 20 KIDS BUT I'VE NEVER
SEEN YOU WITH A CHICK?

97
00:05:05,097 --> 00:05:09,005
JUST DUDES NAMED DONKEY DONG AND
BONER KING, STUFF LIKE THAT.

98
00:05:09,005 --> 00:05:11,960
WATCH THIS.
MARCO.

99
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:14,477
SHORT AND GAY, CLASSY.

100
00:05:14,477 --> 00:05:19,218
ELON, YOU'VE GOT TO LISTEN TO
ME.
MARCO IS A VERY IMPORTANT PART
OF THE TEAM.

101
00:05:19,218 --> 00:05:21,424
AND WE ALL NEED TO --

102
00:05:21,424 --> 00:05:23,382
>> PHASE ONE OF MY PLAN IS
COMPLETE.

103
00:05:23,382 --> 00:05:27,343
INGRATIATE YOURSELF TO THE
PRESIDENT AND TAKE OVER THE
MEDIA.

104
00:05:27,343 --> 00:05:30,115
BUT WAS TAKING THIS JOB A BAD
IDEA?

105
00:05:30,115 --> 00:05:32,291
A LOT OF PEOPLE SEEM TO REALLY
HATE ME.

106
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:34,469
MY TESLA STOCK IS CRASHING,

107
00:05:34,469 --> 00:05:40,179
AND MY PERSONAL NET WORTH JUST
DROPPED BY $100 BILLION.

108
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:45,018
ALL RIGHT?

109
00:05:45,018 --> 00:05:47,103
>> SO, HEADLINES FROM THE
MEETING.

110
00:05:47,103 --> 00:05:50,633
ONE, AMERICA'S DOING BAD GUY
NOW.

111
00:05:50,633 --> 00:05:53,977
TWO, MARCO, GET YOUR BUDGET
UNDER CONTROL.

112
00:05:53,977 --> 00:05:57,393
AND THREE, ELON, STAY IN YOUR
LANE.
YOU'RE NOT THE BOSS.

113
00:05:57,393 --> 00:06:00,700
>> BUT I -- I PAID YOU $300
MILLION.

114
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:02,169
>> AND THAT'S WHY YOU'RE THE
BOSS.

115
00:06:02,169 --> 00:06:05,677
SO, WE'LL GET OUT OF YOUR OFFICE
RIGHT AFTER WE SAY THIS.

116
00:06:05,677 --> 00:06:10,222
LIVE FROM NEW YORK, IT'S
SATURDAY NIGHT!

117
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:25,137
HOST AND MUSICAL GUEST LADY
GAGA!

118
00:08:27,703 --> 00:08:32,532
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN -- LADY GAGA!

119
00:08:53,275 --> 00:08:56,987
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

120
00:08:56,987 --> 00:08:58,969
I'M SO EXCITED TO BE HERE.

121
00:08:58,969 --> 00:09:02,956
I KNOW YOU MIGHT BE THINKING I'M
HERE TO PROMOTE MY ALBUM,
MAYHEM.

122
00:09:02,956 --> 00:09:05,263
BUT I'M ACTUALLY HERE TO REMIND YOU THAT

123
00:09:05,263 --> 00:09:07,532
I'M AN AMAZING ACTOR.

124
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:12,600
LAST TIME I HOSTED "SNL," I WAS
27.

125
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:16,256
I'M 38 NOW, WHICH IS
SCIENTIFICALLY THE BEST AGE

126
00:09:16,256 --> 00:09:18,162
FOR
A FEMALE POP STAR TO BE.

127
00:09:18,162 --> 00:09:21,111
MOST POP STARS ARE OVER 40.

128
00:09:21,111 --> 00:09:22,949
CHAPPELL ROAN IS 58.

129
00:09:22,949 --> 00:09:26,637
AND CHARLI XCX, SHE'S 75.

130
00:09:26,637 --> 00:09:31,202
TATE McRAE IS MY BIOLOGICAL
GRANDMOTHER.

131
00:09:31,202 --> 00:09:33,823
I'M SO HAPPY TO BE BACK AT
SNL.

132
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:37,122
THE LAST TIME I HOSTED WAS IN
2013.

133
00:09:37,122 --> 00:09:41,171
AND EVERY ASPECT OF MY
PERFORMANCE AGED AMAZINGLY.

134
00:09:41,171 --> 00:09:45,837
'CAUSE THERE'S NO NEED TO GOOGLE SNL 2013,

135
00:09:45,837 --> 00:09:49,526
LADY GAGA FEATURING
R. KELLY.

136
00:09:49,929 --> 00:09:54,744
I WON'T BRING IT UP.

137
00:09:54,744 --> 00:09:56,695
BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE BAD.

138
00:09:56,695 --> 00:10:00,232
ANYWAY, I'M AN ACTOR NOW.

139
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:03,987
SELECTING FILMS

140
00:10:03,987 --> 00:10:07,864
THAT WOULD
SHOWCASE MY CRAFT AS A SERIOUS
ACTOR.

141
00:10:07,864 --> 00:10:10,688
FILMS SUCH AS "JOKER 2."

142
00:10:10,688 --> 00:10:13,495
APPARENTLY PEOPLE THOUGHT IT WAS
AWESOME.

143
00:10:13,495 --> 00:10:17,153
JOAQUIN AND I EVEN GOT NOMINATED
FOR A RAZZIE,

144
00:10:17,153 --> 00:10:20,975
WHICH IS AN AWARD
FOR THE WORST FILM OF THE YEAR.

145
00:10:20,975 --> 00:10:22,638
WE WON.

146
00:10:22,638 --> 00:10:26,057
FOR WORST SCREEN DUO.

147
00:10:26,057 --> 00:10:31,364
BUT JOKE'S ON THEM.
I LOVE WINNING THINGS!

148
00:10:31,364 --> 00:10:36,025
AND MY RAZZIE BRINGS ME ONE STEP
CLOSER TO AN EGORT.

149
00:10:36,025 --> 00:10:39,853
IT'S LIKE AN EGOT BUT IT'S
HURTFUL.

150
00:10:39,853 --> 00:10:42,376
TONIGHT I'M THE HOST AND THE
MUSICAL GUEST --

151
00:10:42,376 --> 00:10:47,046
WHICH MEANS SOMEONE MUST
INTRODUCE ME FOR MUSIC.

152
00:10:47,046 --> 00:10:50,072
I ASKED BOWEN TO DO IT, BECAUSE
APPARENTLY HE'S A SUPERFAN.

153
00:10:50,072 --> 00:10:52,231
BUT I THINK I MAKE HIM NERVOUS.

154
00:10:52,231 --> 00:10:54,887
BOWEN, ARE YOU HAPPY I'M HERE?

155
00:10:54,887 --> 00:10:58,395
>> LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, LADY
GAGA!

156
00:11:01,946 --> 00:11:03,442
>> A LITTLE EARLY.

157
00:11:03,442 --> 00:11:05,925
GREAT JOB, BOWEN, YAY!

158
00:11:05,925 --> 00:11:09,954
BIG YEAR.
I GOT ENGAGED.

159
00:11:11,876 --> 00:11:15,601
MY MOM SET US UP.
AND IT'S A TRUE STORY.

160
00:11:15,601 --> 00:11:18,183
MY MOM CALLED ME ONE DAY AND SHE
GOES, "I MET YOUR HUSBAND."

161
00:11:18,183 --> 00:11:21,877
WHAT DOES HE DO?
HE WORKS IN CANCER RESEARCH.

162
00:11:21,877 --> 00:11:26,242
I WAS LITERALLY SMOKING A
CIGARETTE.

163
00:11:26,242 --> 00:11:30,103
AND THEN WE WENT ON THREE DATES
AND I NEVER SMOKED AGAIN.

164
00:11:30,103 --> 00:11:32,659
EXCEPT WHEN I'M DRUNK.

165
00:11:37,579 --> 00:11:39,905
IN ALL SERIOUSNESS --

166
00:11:39,905 --> 00:11:42,249
I'M FROM NEW YORK CITY,

167
00:11:42,249 --> 00:11:45,944
SO HOSTING "SNL" IS SO EXISTENTIAL
TO ME.

168
00:11:45,944 --> 00:11:48,577
I RESPECT EVERYONE HERE SO MUCH.

169
00:11:48,577 --> 00:11:52,161
TONIGHT, I PROMISE TO ACT, TO SING,

170
00:11:52,161 --> 00:11:55,657
AND TO NOT DO "JOKER 3."

171
00:11:55,657 --> 00:11:58,009
WE'VE GOT A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU
TONIGHT. I'M HERE,

172
00:11:58,009 --> 00:12:00,960
SO STICK AROUND, AND
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK!

173
00:12:24,506 --> 00:12:27,152
JEREMY.

174
00:12:27,152 --> 00:12:28,780
YOU CAN STILL COME.

175
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:32,020
I GET MY OWN ROOM IN CAS

176
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:34,760
YOU CAN STAY WITH ME
RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF
PARIS.

177
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:37,576
>> NO WAY. THE LAST THING YOU NEED

178
00:12:37,576 --> 00:12:41,780
IS ME
DRAGGING YOU DOWN IN CAS

179
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:44,683
TRUST ME, BAILEY AND I WILL BE
FINE.

180
00:12:44,683 --> 00:12:48,404
ALICIA, BEING A CHEF HAS ALWAYS
BEEN YOUR DREAM.

181
00:12:48,404 --> 00:12:50,187
NOW GO GET IT.

182
00:12:50,187 --> 00:12:52,646
BUT BEFORE YOU LEAVE FOR THE AIRPORT,

183
00:12:52,646 --> 00:12:56,044
PROMISE ME JUST ONE
THING.
>> ANYTHING.

184
00:12:56,044 --> 00:12:57,886
>> NEVER LOOK BACK.

185
00:12:57,886 --> 00:13:00,002
NEVER.
GOT IT?

186
00:13:00,002 --> 00:13:03,488
>> I LOVE YOU, JEREMY.
>> I LOVE YOU TOO.

187
00:13:03,488 --> 00:13:05,573
NOW GO.
>> OKAY.

188
00:13:05,573 --> 00:13:10,375
AND THANKS FOR THE RIDEABLE
LUGGAGE.

189
00:13:13,366 --> 00:13:15,775
>> ALICIA, WAIT!

190
00:13:23,254 --> 00:13:26,405
>> YES?
>> I JUST WANTED TO SAY --

191
00:13:26,405 --> 00:13:30,505
I
HOPE YOU HAVE A DELICIOUS LIFE.

192
00:13:30,505 --> 00:13:32,379
>> WHAT?

193
00:13:32,379 --> 00:13:37,511
>> 'CAUSE YOU'RE A CHEF.
THAT'S WHY I SAID THAT.

194
00:13:37,511 --> 00:13:40,594
HAVE A DELICIOUS LIFE.
BECAUSE YOU'RE A CHEF?

195
00:13:40,594 --> 00:13:43,845
>> YEAH.
OKAY.
>> I'M SORRY.

196
00:13:43,845 --> 00:13:47,652
GO, ALICIA, GO, NEVER LOOK BACK!
>> BYE.

197
00:13:49,601 --> 00:13:54,221
>> MY GOD.
WHAT HAVE I DONE?

198
00:13:54,221 --> 00:13:57,136
I MAY HAVE MADE THE BIGGEST
MISTAKE OF MY LIFE

199
00:13:57,136 --> 00:14:02,937
ALICIA, NO!

200
00:14:09,615 --> 00:14:14,872
>> GO AROUND!
GO AROUND!

201

HEY, THERE, PRETTY LADY.

203
00:14:22,156 --> 00:14:25,471
>> THEY CALL US THE SONS OF
SAMSONITE.

204
00:14:25,471 --> 00:14:29,865
LUGGAGE RIDING ALL OVER THIS

YEARS.

>> YEAH, FROM NEW JERSEY ALL THE
WAY TO NEW YORK.

206

WHERE ARE YOU HEADING, LITTLE
MAMA?

207
00:14:35,679 --> 00:14:40,170

>> I'M JUST -- I HAVE TO LEAVE
SOMEBODY VERY SPECIAL BEHIND.

212
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:55,395
>> THAT'S A SHAME.
HEY, CAN I SAY SOMETHING?

213
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:59,651
HONEY, THERE'S FANCY CULINARY

GO AROUND!

216
00:15:04,122 --> 00:15:08,078
LOVE IS RARE.
SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT.

OH, OH NO.
I'M OUT OF POWER!

223
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:32,231
I SHOULD HAVE HAD A FULL CHARGE.

224
00:15:32,231 --> 00:15:34,767
GO AROUND!

225
00:15:37,512 --> 00:15:41,639

IT'S SO DANGEROUS!

00:16:14,451 --> 00:16:17,276
>> MADE IT.
WHERE'S MY BAG?

237
00:16:17,276 --> 00:16:20,199
RIGHT HERE.

238
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:24,752
>> ALICIA.
YOU CAN'T GET ON THAT PLANE.

239
00:16:24,752 --> 00:16:27,236
>> YOU'RE RIGHT.
I CAN'T.

240
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:31,072
IT TOOK OFF OVER THREE HOURS
AGO.

241

00:21:34,284 --> 00:21:37,943
>> SOMEBODY HELP!

308
00:21:38,629 --> 00:21:42,614
OH, MY GOD, PIP.

309
00:21:42,936 --> 00:21:46,876
>> EVERYBODY OUT, HURRY!

310
00:21:51,897 --> 00:21:55,002
>> PIP.
I'M SORRY, MAN.

311
00:21:55,002 --> 00:21:58,030
TRUTH IS -- MY DAD'S HARD ON ME,

312
00:21:58,030 --> 00:22:00,271
SO I TOOK IT IT OUT ON PIP.

313
00:22:00,271 --> 00:22:03,344
FROM NOW ON I PROMISE, I
NEVER --

314
00:22:10,981 --> 00:22:14,334
>> IT JUST GOT TOO HEAVY, RIGHT,
PIP?

315
00:22:15,624 --> 00:22:20,029
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.
RIGHT, PIP?

316
00:22:35,178 --> 00:22:36,893
NO

317
00:22:37,046 --> 00:22:39,775
BOTTLE, SIR?
>> NO.

318
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:42,691
>> OKAY.
SO YOU'RE AWARE,

319
00:22:42,691 --> 00:22:46,182
SINCE YOU
ORDERED THE BOTTLE AND I OPENED
IT, YOU STILL HAVE TO PAY FOR
IT.

320
00:22:46,182 --> 00:22:50,757
>> FINE, BUT I WON'T HAVE MY
BEAUTIFUL DATE DRINKING THAT
SWILL.

321
00:22:50,757 --> 00:22:53,762
BRING US A BOTTLE OF THE
ROMANEE-CONTI

322
00:22:53,762 --> 00:22:56,059
1982.

323
00:22:56,059 --> 00:22:58,249
>> A MAN OF FINE TASTES, I SEE.

324
00:22:58,249 --> 00:23:03,070
>> YES.
IN WINE, NICHE ANIME,

325
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:05,114
AND WOMEN.

326
00:23:06,238 --> 00:23:07,776
I LOVE THIS SONG.

327
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:09,287
>> THEN DANCE WITH ME TO IT.

328
00:23:09,287 --> 00:23:12,097
>> DANCE?
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE RESTAURANT?

329
00:23:12,097 --> 00:23:13,485
PEOPLE WILL STARE.
>> GOOD.

330
00:23:13,485 --> 00:23:18,266
I WANT EVERYONE TO SEE ME
DANCING WITH THE MOST BEAUTIFUL
WOMAN IN THE ROOM.

331
00:23:18,461 --> 00:23:21,866
¶ IT'S LATE IN THE EVENING

332
00:23:21,866 --> 00:23:25,203
SHE'S WONDERING WHAT CLOTHES TO
WEAR ¶

333
00:23:25,203 --> 00:23:28,975
¶ SO I PUT ON MY MAKEUP

334
00:23:28,975 --> 00:23:32,458
AND I BRUSH MY LONG BLOND HAIR ¶

335
00:23:32,458 --> 00:23:35,388
¶ AND THEN SHE ASKS ME

336
00:23:35,388 --> 00:23:38,201
DO I LOOK ALL RIGHT ¶

337
00:23:38,201 --> 00:23:39,891
¶ AND I SAY YES

338
00:23:39,891 --> 00:23:45,358
YOU LOOK WONDERFUL TONIGHT ¶

339
00:23:46,174 --> 00:23:49,347
>> I'M JEAN FRANCO, BY THE WAY.

340
00:23:49,347 --> 00:23:51,476
I DON'T THINK WE TOLD EACH OTHER
OUR NAMES.

341
00:23:51,476 --> 00:23:52,813
>> JANELLE.

342
00:23:52,813 --> 00:23:56,494
IF YOU'RE HOPING TO GET ME IN
BED TONIGHT, YOU'LL BE
DISAPPOINTED.

343
00:23:56,494 --> 00:23:58,903
>> OH, YOU WON'T SLEEP WITH
SOMEONE ON THE FIRST DATE?

344
00:23:58,903 --> 00:24:00,194
>> NO, I'LL SLEEP WITH YOU.

345
00:24:00,194 --> 00:24:03,319
YOU'LL JUST BE DISAPPOINTED
BECAUSE I'M NOT VERY GOOD AT IT.

346
00:24:03,319 --> 00:24:06,181
>> WHY DON'T YOU LET ME BE THE
JUDGE OF THAT?

347
00:24:06,181 --> 00:24:07,248
AND I WILL JUDGE.

348
00:24:07,248 --> 00:24:10,754
THEN WRITE A DETAILED PLAY BY
PLAY ON MY SUBSTACK.

349
00:24:10,754 --> 00:24:13,658
>> I'D EXPECT NOTHING LESS.

350
00:24:13,658 --> 00:24:16,972
>> IT'S LATER THAT EVENING

351
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:20,560
AND WE'RE WASTED IN TIMES SQUARE ¶

352
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:24,013
¶ SO I EAT A FULL BIG MAC

353
00:24:24,013 --> 00:24:27,598
AND I SHAVE OFF MY BODY HAIR ¶

354
00:24:27,598 --> 00:24:29,919
¶ AND THEN SHE BITES ME

355
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:33,271
ON BOTH MY NIPPLES LEFT AND RIGHT ¶

356
00:24:33,271 --> 00:24:35,056
¶ AND I SAY BITCH

357
00:24:35,056 --> 00:24:39,246
YOU LOOK WONDERFUL TONIGHT ¶

358
00:24:39,246 --> 00:24:41,812
>> IF WE'RE TO GO ANY FARTHER,
YOU SHOULD KNOW

359
00:24:41,812 --> 00:24:43,564
MY HEART BELONGS
TO SOMEONE ELSE.

360
00:24:43,564 --> 00:24:45,590
>> OH.
WHAT'S HIS NAME?

361
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:48,590
>> ORGAN DONOR 2685.

362
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:50,973
THANK GOD FOR MOTORCYCLES,
RIGHT?

363
00:24:50,973 --> 00:24:54,311
>> INDEED.
YOU KNOW, I WORK IN MEDICINE.

364
00:24:54,311 --> 00:24:55,938
>> A DOCTOR?
>> CLOSE.

365
00:24:55,938 --> 00:24:58,584
I DO THE STAFF DISCLAIMERS IN
MEDICATION ADS.

366
00:24:58,584 --> 00:24:59,882
ASK YOUR DOCTOR BEFORE STARTING.

367
00:24:59,882 --> 00:25:03,320
STOP IMMEDIATELY IF YOUR
DIARRHEA LASTS LONGER THAN SIX
DAYS.

368
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:06,402
>> JUST LIKE ME, FALLING FOR AN
ACTOR.

369
00:25:06,402 --> 00:25:10,408
¶ I FEEL WONDERFUL 'CAUSE I SEE

370
00:25:10,408 --> 00:25:13,713
THE LOVE LIGHT IN YOUR EYES ¶

371
00:25:13,713 --> 00:25:16,829
¶ AND THE BEAUTY OF IT ALL

372
00:25:16,829 --> 00:25:19,869
IS THAT ¶
¶ YOU JUST DON'T REALIZE

373
00:25:19,869 --> 00:25:22,910
ITALIANS AREN'T WHITES ¶

374
00:25:23,952 --> 00:25:26,593
THANK

375
00:25:26,593 --> 00:25:27,683
>> MY PLEASURE.

376
00:25:27,683 --> 00:25:32,653
DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT PAYING.
I RECENTLY CAME INTO SOME MONEY.

377
00:25:32,653 --> 00:25:36,023
>> YES, THERE WERE NO TISSUES
NEARBY.

378
00:25:38,735 --> 00:25:42,856
I HAD TO BLAST IT SOMEWHERE, SO
WHY NOT 20s?

379
00:25:42,856 --> 00:25:44,629
>> MAKES SENSE TO ME.

380
00:25:44,629 --> 00:25:47,815
I HOPE YOU'RE NOT ONE OF THOSE
FLY BY NIGHT TYPES.

381
00:25:47,815 --> 00:25:52,148
>> WELL, I AM FLY AND BI.
- WHO

382
00:25:52,148 --> 00:25:55,397
¶ WE GO TO A PARTY

383
00:25:55,397 --> 00:25:58,661
AND EVERYONE SCREAMS AT ME ¶

384
00:25:58,661 --> 00:26:02,376
¶ 'CAUSE IT'S A 5-YEAR-OLD'S PARTY

385
00:26:02,376 --> 00:26:05,754
AND I'M SMOKING PCP ¶

386
00:26:05,754 --> 00:26:08,073
¶ I EAT THE WHOLE BIRTHDAY CAKE

387
00:26:08,073 --> 00:26:11,288
WHILE ALL THE CHILDREN CRY ¶

388
00:26:11,288 --> 00:26:13,278
¶ I SHOUT GODDAMN

389
00:26:13,278 --> 00:26:17,942
I FEEL WONDERFUL TONIGHT ¶

390
00:26:17,942 --> 00:26:19,603
>> A BEAUTIFUL SONG.

391
00:26:19,603 --> 00:26:22,882
>> A BEAUTIFUL SONG FOR A
BEAUTIFUL WOMAN.

392
00:26:24,097 --> 00:26:27,509
>> ROMANEE-CONTI 1982, SIR.

393
00:26:29,225 --> 00:26:31,607
>> PERFECT.
HOW MUCH IS THE BOTTLE?

394
00:26:31,607 --> 00:26:34,334
>> $28,000.

395
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:36,242
>> RUN.

396
00:27:10,466 --> 00:27:14,544
THANK

397
00:27:14,544 --> 00:27:16,238
YOUR SUPPORT IS WONDERFUL.

398
00:27:16,238 --> 00:27:19,682
>> AWW, YOUR FATHER RICKY
SOUNDED LIKE AN INCREDIBLE MAN.

399
00:27:19,682 --> 00:27:22,147
>> AND HOW AMAZING OF A DAUGHTER WERE YOU,

400
00:27:22,147 --> 00:27:24,955
GIVING HIM SUCH GOOD
CARE AT THE END.

401
00:27:24,955 --> 00:27:28,750
TINA, WE KNOW THE GRIEVING
PROCESS HAS JUST BEGUN,

402
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:31,166
AND IT'S
HARD TO MAKE THESE TOUGH
DECISIONS.

403
00:27:31,166 --> 00:27:32,698
BUT WE'RE HERE FOR YOU.

404
00:27:32,698 --> 00:27:36,591
>> AND WE REALLY MEAN IT WHEN WE
SAY, HE'S PART OF OUR FAMILY
NOW.

405
00:27:36,591 --> 00:27:40,626
>> OH, THANK YOU.
>> IT'S BEAUTIFUL, THANKS, GUYS.

406
00:27:40,626 --> 00:27:44,374
>> SO, TO START OFF FOR THE FUNERAL,

407
00:27:44,374 --> 00:27:48,020
WHAT KIND OF A VIBE DID
YOU PICTURE?

408
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:52,394
>> VIBE?
HM, I GUESS I NEVER THOUGHT OF
THAT.

409
00:27:52,394 --> 00:27:55,601
>> YEAH, I'M SURE.
IT COULD BE AS SIMPLE

410
00:27:55,601 --> 00:27:58,169
AS A
CELEBRATION OF LIFE.

411
00:27:58,169 --> 00:28:02,061
>> OR THE SECOND ONE THAT COMES
TO MIND IS, LIKE,

412
00:28:02,061 --> 00:28:04,669
THE ROARING
'20s.

413
00:28:04,669 --> 00:28:07,465
>> THAT SOUNDS KIND OF WEIRD FOR
ME.

414
00:28:07,465 --> 00:28:10,010
I JUST DON'T WANT TO FEEL LIKE A
THEME PARTY.

415
00:28:10,010 --> 00:28:12,660
>> OH, IT'S NOT A THEME PARTY.
>> NO THEME PARTY,

416
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:16,118
JUST A SUBTLE
NOD TO THE ROARING '20s.

417
00:28:17,708 --> 00:28:19,917
>> UM -- OKAY, I GUESS IF IT'S
SUBTLE.

418
00:28:19,917 --> 00:28:21,738
>> YEAH.
SUBTLE.

419
00:28:21,738 --> 00:28:24,146
A FEW WORDS FROM FAMILY
MEMBERS.

420
00:28:24,146 --> 00:28:28,880
AND A BURLESQUE PERFORMANCE BY
BIG MAMA AND THE FLAPPER GIRLS.

421
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:32,206
>> YOU KNOW, THEN WE COULD
OBVIOUSLY PASS OUT CHARACTER CARDS,

422
00:28:32,206 --> 00:28:34,009
MAKE IT A MURDER MYSTERY
GAME.

423
00:28:34,009 --> 00:28:37,613
>> OR SOMETHING AS SIMPLE AS A
CELEBRATION OF LIFE.

424
00:28:37,613 --> 00:28:42,298
>> YEAH -- A MURDER MYSTERY
PARLOR GAME WOULD BE VERY
UNCOMFORTABLE FOR ME.

425
00:28:42,298 --> 00:28:46,336
ESPECIALLY BECAUSE MY DAD WAS
MURDERED, AND IT'S STILL
UNSOLVED.

426
00:28:46,336 --> 00:28:51,022
>> OKAY.
WELL, WHY DON'T YOU GUYS JUST
TELL US WHAT YOU WERE
ENVISIONING.

427
00:28:51,022 --> 00:28:54,253
>> I WAS THINKING MORE LIKE A
SLIDE SHOW OF PICTURES.

428
00:28:54,253 --> 00:28:56,966
>> IMMEDIATELY NO.
>> NO.

429
00:28:56,966 --> 00:29:00,885
>> WHY IMMEDIATELY NO?
THAT SEEMS LIKE THE EASIEST
THING TO DO.

430
00:29:00,885 --> 00:29:06,343
>> UM, WELL, DID THEY HAVE HDMI
CABLES IN THE 1920s?

431
00:29:06,883 --> 00:29:08,249
>> THEY DIDN'T.

432
00:29:08,249 --> 00:29:11,253
>> OKAY.
YOU KNOW, THIS JUST ISN'T RIGHT
FOR US.

433
00:29:11,253 --> 00:29:12,713
>> WELL, WAIT.

434
00:29:12,713 --> 00:29:15,590
COULD I, LIKE, DRESS UP AS
GATSBY OR WHATEVER?

435
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:19,075
>> BABE, NO, I'M LEAVING.
WE ARE LEAVING, I'M SORRY.

436
00:29:19,075 --> 00:29:20,917
>> NO, PLEASE, WE'RE SORRY.

437
00:29:21,007 --> 00:29:25,974
BUT I SWEAR TO YOU, AND TO GOD,
AND ON MY CHILDREN'S LIVES,

438
00:29:25,974 --> 00:29:29,280
THE
WORDS "ROARING '20s" WILL NOT
PASS THROUGH THESE LIPS AGAIN.

439
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:32,418
>> OKAY, I GUESS I CAN GIVE YOU
GUYS A SHOT, THEN.

440
00:29:32,418 --> 00:29:34,858
SO, WILL YOU PROVIDE
REFRESHMENTS?

441
00:29:34,858 --> 00:29:38,630
>> HEY, IT WOULDN'T BE A ROWING
'20s PARTY WITHOUT MOONSHINE.

442
00:29:38,630 --> 00:29:42,517
>> WE HAVE A FULL-SERVICE
BARTENDER.
JACKSON?

443
00:29:43,505 --> 00:29:46,969
>> WE MADE A SPECIALTY COCKTAIL
TO HONOR YOUR FATHER.

444
00:29:46,969 --> 00:29:50,287
IT'S CALLED THE GIN RIP RICKY.

445
00:29:50,697 --> 00:29:55,758
NO, BUT SERIOUSLY, I LISTENED TO
THE PODCAST ABOUT YOUR DAD'S
UNSOLVED MURDER,

446
00:29:55,758 --> 00:29:59,548
AND HONESTLY,
BE CAREFUL WHO YOU TRUST.

447
00:29:59,548 --> 00:30:01,970
>> I DIDN'T KILL HER DAD!

448
00:30:01,970 --> 00:30:05,807
>> OH, YEP, AND AT THE END OF
THE FUNERAL THE GALS SHALL
DANCE.

449
00:30:05,807 --> 00:30:07,210
HIT IT!

450
00:30:29,011 --> 00:30:33,153
>> OR IT COULD BE AS SIMPLE AS A
CELEBRATION OF LIFE.

451
00:30:33,773 --> 00:30:37,347
>> TINA, WOULD YOU MAKE ME THE
HAPPIEST MAN ON EARTH?

452
00:30:37,347 --> 00:30:39,972
>> WHAT?
THIS IS THE WORST POSSIBLE TIME.

453
00:30:39,972 --> 00:30:41,740
>> CONGRATULATIONS!

454
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:45,033
>> NO, NO, NO.
I'M LEAVING THIS PLACE.

455
00:30:45,033 --> 00:30:46,025
I'M LEAVING YOU.

456
00:30:46,025 --> 00:30:47,627
>> HIT IT!

457
00:30:49,419 --> 00:30:51,284
>> WELL, LOOKS LIKE I'M SINGLE

ALL OVER YOUR FACE?

470
00:31:31,010 --> 00:31:34,148

HAVE YOU
TALKED TO MELISSA?
IT SEEMS LIKE SOMETHING'S REALLY
WRONG.

478
00:31:49,853 --> 00:31:52,058
>> HEY, SORRY ABOUT THE
PROMOTION.

479
00:31:52,058 --> 00:31:54,163
>> IT'S OKAY.
I'LL GET IT NEXT TIME.

480
00:31:54,163 --> 00:31:56,395
>> L'OREAL EASY RUN,

>> THIS MASCARA IS THE PERFECT WAY TO SAY,

485

NO, YOU GUYS GO

488
00:32:15,265 --> 00:32:16,847
HAPPY BIRTHDAY.

489

WORTH IT.

WEEK GEBDING OUR HISTORICAL BEST FRIEND, RUSSIA,

559
00:38:11,016 --> 00:38:16,835
TRUMP DETERMINED
THIS WEEK TO ATTACKING OUR SWORN
ENEMY, CANADA.

00:38:16,835 --> 00:38:21,065
THAT'S RIGHT.
THOSE SYRUP-GUZZLING, POUTINE-MUNCHING,

MOOSE-HUMPING HOCKEY SLUTS

ARE BEING STOLEN BY FILTHY
CANADIANS.

566
00:38:37,055 --> 00:38:40,424
>>> PRESIDENT TRUMP ADDRESSED A
JOINT SESSION OF CONGRESS

567
00:38:40,424 --> 00:38:43,908
AND
CLAIMED THAT NO PRESIDENT HAS
CHANGED GOVERNMENT FASTER THAN
HIM.

568
00:38:43,908 --> 00:38:48,580
YEAH, AND NOBODY CHANGED AIRPORT
SECURITY FASTER THAN BIN LADEN.

569
00:38:49,259 --> 00:38:52,876
PRESIDENT TRUMP ALSO SAID THAT
HE SIGNED AN EXECUTIVE ORDER

570
00:38:52,876 --> 00:38:55,922
TO
BAN MEN FROM PLAYING IN WOMEN'S
SPORTS.

00:38:55,922 --> 00:38:58,048
BUT IF MEN AREN'T ALLOWED TO

SOCCER.

576
00:39:15,015 --> 00:39:19,640
SAID THAT CLOSING THE DEPARTMENT
OF EDUCATION WOULD NOT HURT STUDENTS,

577
00:39:19,733 --> 00:39:22,062
 AND ACTUALLY, TEST
SCORES MIGHT GO UP.

MAYBE EVEN AS HIGH AS 69.

579

>>> AFTER IMPOSING TARIFFS ON
MEXICO AND CANADA ON TUESDAY,

580
00:39:32,442 --> 00:39:34,969
PRESIDENT TRUMP REVERSED THEM ON
THURSDAY.

581
00:39:34,969 --> 00:39:37,629
IT'S A CUNNING POLITICAL TACTIC
EXPERTS CALL

BIPOLAR DISORDER.

583
00:39:40,197 --> 00:39:43,983
PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID THE TARIFFS
ON GOODS FROM CANADA

584
00:39:43,983 --> 00:39:45,668
 IS TO STOP
THE FLOW OF FENTANYL,

585
00:39:45,668 --> 00:39:50,472
 EVEN
THOUGH LAST YEAR ONLY 40 POUNDS
OF THE DRUG WAS SEIZED AT THE
NORTHERN BORDER.

586
00:39:50,472 --> 00:39:54,259
40 POUNDS, WHAT'S THAT, LIKE TWO
BUTTFULS?

TWO BUSTFULS?

588
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:02,667
I THOUGHT IT WAS SMART.

589
00:40:03,204 --> 00:40:05,886
>>> EXPERTS SAY THAT PRESIDENT
TRUMP'S TARIFFS 

590
00:40:05,886 --> 00:40:09,910
WILL RAISE THE
COST OF A NEW CAR BY AS MUCH AS
$12,000.

591
00:40:09,910 --> 00:40:11,664
OR YOU CAN GET A FREE TESLA,

AWAY.

AND WHITE KANYE, ELON MUSK --

SUIT INSTEAD OF A
JACKET AND T-SHIRT TO THIS
WEEK'S CABINET MEETING 

595
00:40:32,730 --> 00:40:35,308
AFTER
PRESIDENT TRUMP MADE FUN OF HIS
CLOTHING.

596
00:40:35,308 --> 00:40:39,986
IT'S A REFRESHING REMINDER THAT
BULLYING STILL WORKS.

597
00:40:40,610 --> 00:40:44,000
>>> ON THURSDAY, ELON MUSK'S
SPACEX STARSHIP

598

 EXPLODED JUST
MINUTES INTO ITS MISSION,

599
00:40:46,581 --> 00:40:49,699
 WHICH
IS HOW HE ENDED UP WITH ALL
THOSE KIDS.

600
00:40:54,416 --> 00:40:58,996
IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE LEADERS
OF GREAT BRITAIN AND FRANCE

HAVE
BEEN COACHING VOLODYMYR
ZELENSKYY ON HOW TO DEAL WITH
PRESIDENT TRUMP.

602
00:41:02,868 --> 00:41:07,450
KIND OF LIKE HOW YOU NEED EXTRA

PERFORMING HER SONG.

785
00:47:46,331 --> 00:47:48,264
I WISH SHE DRESSED LIKE THAT ON

>> OF COURSE THERE IS.

794
00:47:55,807 --> 00:47:56,505

796
00:47:58,309 --> 00:48:00,509
SHE MARRIED A LORD.

797
00:48:00,511 --> 00:48:02,278
THAT'S HOW SHE BECAME A GAGA,

798
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:03,479
WHEREAS I WAS SIMPLY BORN THIS

799
00:48:03,481 --> 00:48:03,746

801
00:48:13,858 --> 00:48:16,292
WHY HAVEN'T WE EVER SEN YOU WITH

802

810
00:48:26,504 --> 00:48:27,637
YOU MUST BE VERY PROUD OF ALL

811
00:48:27,639 --> 00:48:28,337
HER ACCOMPLISHMENTS.

812
00:48:28,339 --> 00:48:29,071
>> WELL, I'M GLAD SHE HAS A

813
00:48:29,073 --> 00:48:29,372
HOBBY.

814
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:37,513
>> I THINK IT'S MORE THAN A

815
00:48:37,515 --> 00:48:37,813
HOBBY.

816
00:48:37,815 --> 00:48:39,448
SHE'S ONE OF THE BEST-SELLING

WELL, GOOD FOR HER.

821
00:48:46,291 --> 00:48:47,223
>> YOU DIDN'T KNOW THAT?

822
00:48:47,225 --> 00:48:49,992
>> NO, I'M TERRIBLY BUSY WITH

823
00:48:49,994 --> 00:48:50,359
BUSINESS.

824
00:48:50,361 --> 00:48:51,761
BUT WE'RE VERY HAPPY.

825
00:48:51,763 --> 00:48:52,695
IT'S CERTAINLY NOT A BAD

826
00:48:52,697 --> 00:48:53,029
ROMANCE.

827
00:48:59,003 --> 00:48:59,568
>> OKAY.

828
00:48:59,570 --> 00:49:01,537

DEBUTANTE BALL.

832
00:49:05,576 --> 00:49:07,043

WIDOWED FRIENDS TO MARRY.

835
00:49:11,349 --> 00:49:13,382
YOU'VE BEEN TO THOSE.

836
00:49:13,384 --> 00:49:14,083
>> I HAVEN'T.

837
00:49:14,485 --> 00:49:15,584

842
00:49:21,225 --> 00:49:22,725
SUBPAR, BUT THE DAZZLING GIRL

843
00:49:22,727 --> 00:49:24,493
BEHIND THE PIANO CAUGHT MY EYE.

844
00:49:24,495 --> 00:49:26,228
SO I MADE HER MY WIFE.

845
00:49:26,230 --> 00:49:28,331
NOW WE HAVE SEVEN GORGEOUS

846
00:49:28,333 --> 00:49:28,698
CHILDREN.

AND COLIN, AGAIN, THANK YOU FOR

850
00:49:37,675 --> 00:49:39,542
INDULGING MY WIFE'S HOBBY AND

00:49:39,544 --> 00:49:41,344
LETTING HER SING ON YOUR LITTLE

852
00:49:41,346 --> 00:49:42,378
TALENT SHOW.

853
00:49:42,380 --> 00:49:43,779
>> OKAY, ACTUALLY, SHE'S

854
00:49:43,781 --> 00:49:44,280
INDULGING US.

855

YOUR WIFE IS VERY SUCCESSFUL,

856
00:49:45,950 --> 00:49:46,215
SIR.

857
00:49:46,217 --> 00:49:47,416
SHE HAS 14 GRAMMYS AND AN OSCAR.

858
00:49:51,055 --> 00:49:52,388
>> YOU DON'T SAY, WOW.

859
00:49:52,390 --> 00:49:54,790
WHAT A FEATHER IN HER CAP.

860
00:49:55,193 --> 00:49:58,361
IF ONLY IT ALL PAID, EH?

861
00:49:58,363 --> 00:50:00,763
>> I THINK IT DOES.

862

I THINK IT ACTUALLY PAYS A LOT.

863
00:50:01,866 --> 00:50:03,666
>> WELL, IT CERTAINLY CAN'T BE

864
00:50:03,668 --> 00:50:04,367
MORE THAN WHAT TEXTILES BRING

865
00:50:04,369 --> 00:50:06,635
IN.

866
00:50:06,637 --> 00:50:09,238
CAN YOU IMAGINE, COLIN?

867
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:10,139
A MAN WHOSE WIFE MAKES MORE

868
00:50:10,141 --> 00:50:11,273
MONEY THAN HE?

869
00:50:13,911 --> 00:50:20,216
CAN YOU IMAGINE?

870
00:50:20,218 --> 00:50:23,519
OH, THE SHAME HE WOULD FEEL!

871

IMAGINE, COLIN.

872
00:50:24,422 --> 00:50:28,591

KNOWING THAT MY WIFE'S INCOME

877
00:50:40,171 --> 00:50:40,636
DWARVES MY OWN?

878
00:50:44,776 --> 00:50:47,209
OH, OH!

879
00:50:47,211 --> 00:50:49,879
OH, I WOULD DIE!

880
00:50:49,881 --> 00:50:50,479
WHAT A LIVING NIGHTMARE.

881
00:50:52,250 --> 00:50:54,350
WHAT A NIGHTMARE!

882
00:50:54,352 --> 00:50:55,684
OH!

883

OH.

NOW TELL ME, WHAT DOES YOUR WIFE

887
00:51:04,562 --> 00:51:04,827
