1
00:00:06,388 --> 00:00:08,800
GOOD EVENING

2
00:00:11,923 --> 00:00:14,771
>>> I'M LAURA INGRAHAM,

3
00:00:14,771 --> 00:00:20,254
AND AS SOON AS I MARRY YOUR DAD, I'M
SENDING YOU STRAIGHT TO BOARDING
SCHOOL.

4
00:00:20,254 --> 00:00:24,156
WELL, WE'RE FINALLY DONE WITH
YEAR ONE OF BIDEN'S PRESIDENCY.

5
00:00:24,156 --> 00:00:27,198
CAN WE ALL ADMIT IT'S A
DISASTER?

6
00:00:27,198 --> 00:00:29,618
INFLATION'S OUT OF CONTROL.

7
00:00:29,618 --> 00:00:32,787
GAS IS AT $19 A GALLON.

8
00:00:32,787 --> 00:00:37,167
AND THE GREEN M&M HAS BEEN
CANCELED JUST FOR BEING A WHORE.

9
00:00:37,167 --> 00:00:40,539
THINGS ARE SO BAD IN BIDEN'S AMERICA,

10
00:00:40,539 --> 00:00:44,903
EVEN FORMER WENDY'S
SPOKES GIRL JEN PSAKI

11
00:00:44,904 --> 00:00:48,303
LOOK

12
00:00:48,303 --> 00:00:52,529
NOT PASS
VOTING RIGHTS IS APPARENTLY NOT
GOING TO PASS.

13
00:00:52,529 --> 00:00:56,777
AND VACCINE REQUIREMENTS ARE
APPARENTLY ILLEGAL.

14
00:00:56,777 --> 00:00:57,772
WHAT HAPPENED?

15
00:00:57,772 --> 00:00:59,457
>> WE ARE NOT GOOD PEOPLE.

16
00:00:59,538 --> 00:01:03,018
THE AMERICAN PUBLIC SHOULD VOTE
US OUT.

17
00:01:03,018 --> 00:01:06,218
>> THE BEST TWO THINGS SHE'S
EVER SAID.

18
00:01:06,218 --> 00:01:11,638
PLUS THE NATION IS STILL
MOURNING FROM THE SUDDEN LOSS OF
AMERICA'S DAD,

19
00:01:11,638 --> 00:01:12,986
ROBERT DURST.

20
00:01:12,986 --> 00:01:16,992
THE COUNTRY'S ON ITS LAST LEGS,
FOLKS.

21
00:01:16,992 --> 00:01:21,152
LIBERALS WANT TO TAKE AWAY
EVERYTHING THAT MAKES YOU
AMERICAN.

22
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:24,220
FOR EXAMPLE, GUNS, HAMBURGERS,

23
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:25,792
MORGAN WALLEN.

24
00:01:25,846 --> 00:01:29,854
I DON'T CARE IF HE USES A SLUR,
I JUST WANT TO DANCE.

25
00:01:29,854 --> 00:01:31,646
YOUR BACKUP GUNS,

26
00:01:31,646 --> 00:01:34,950
COMMERCIAL WHERE THE WHOLE FAMILY IS THE
SAME THING.

27
00:01:35,031 --> 00:01:37,529
USING THE WORD MAYONNAISE.

28
00:01:37,529 --> 00:01:41,442
IT'S AIOLI ALL OF A SUDDEN, NO
THANKS, LIN-MANUEL.

29
00:01:41,442 --> 00:01:45,312
AND FINALLY, MISSIONARY.

30
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:51,743
MY FIRST GUEST TONIGHT IS HERE
TO TALK ABOUT HOW HE'S PUSHING
BACK AGAINST BIDEN'S TYRANNY.

31
00:01:51,832 --> 00:01:54,028
YOU KNOW HIM.
YOU KNOW HIM.

32
00:01:54,028 --> 00:01:56,111
TED CRUZ.

33
00:01:59,415 --> 00:02:02,091
HELLO, LAURA.
THANKS FOR HAVING ME.

34
00:02:02,091 --> 00:02:04,413
>> BEARD STILL GOING STRONG,
HUH, TED?

35
00:02:04,413 --> 00:02:07,357
>> OH, YEAH.
MY BEARD IS LIKE JANUARY 6th.

36
00:02:07,357 --> 00:02:11,295
SHOCKING AT FIRST, BUT SADLY
IT'S BEEN NORMALIZED.

37
00:02:11,295 --> 00:02:15,286
SPEAKING OF JANUARY 6th, YOU
RECENTLY HAD TO APOLOGIZE

38
00:02:15,286 --> 00:02:18,224
FOR CALLING THE CAPITOL RIOTERS
TERRORISTS.

39
00:02:18,224 --> 00:02:20,799
>> I AGREE WITH YOU 100%.

40
00:02:20,799 --> 00:02:22,911
I NEVER SHOULD HAVE CALLED THEM
TERRORISTS.

41
00:02:22,911 --> 00:02:26,799
THE TRUTH IS, THEY ARE BIG,
BURLY
MEN WITH BIG "D" ENERGY.

42
00:02:26,799 --> 00:02:28,060
IN FACT, I ACTUALLY LIKE THEM A
LOT.

43
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:30,733
THEY ARE MY COOL FRIENDS.

44
00:02:30,733 --> 00:02:34,242
AND DONALD, IF YOU'RE WATCHING,
I LOVE YOU, BABY.

45
00:02:34,242 --> 00:02:38,705
YOU ARE THE KING.
HONESTLY, HIT ME.

46
00:02:38,705 --> 00:02:41,298
>> DID YOU JUST ASK TRUMP TO HIT
YOU?

47
00:02:41,298 --> 00:02:45,141
>> OH, I DON'T KNOW.
HIT ME, CHOKE ME, SPIT IN MY
FACE.

48
00:02:45,141 --> 00:02:47,586
I JUST WANT TO STAY IN THE MIX.

49
00:02:47,586 --> 00:02:49,429
>> THANKS FOR BEING HERE, TED.

50
00:02:49,429 --> 00:02:50,820
>> OH, AND ONE MORE THING.

51
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:54,445
I LIKE TO REMIND ALL MY FELLOW
TEXANS WATCHING AT HOME

52
00:02:54,445 --> 00:02:56,281
THAT
FEBRUARY'S GOING TO BE A COLD ONE,

53
00:02:56,281 --> 00:02:59,479
SO YOU MIGHT WANT TO BOOK
YOUR VACAY TO CANCUN NOW.

54
00:02:59,568 --> 00:03:02,853
LIVE MAS, EVERYBODY!

55
00:03:03,128 --> 00:03:04,970
ADVICE

56
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:09,979
AND I'D LIKE TO TAKE A MOMENT TO
THANK MY FEW REMAINING LOYAL
SPONSORS.

57
00:03:09,979 --> 00:03:11,849
COVID NEGS,

58
00:03:11,849 --> 00:03:15,818
THE COVID TEST
THAT'S GUARANTEED TO BE NEGATIVE
EVEN IF YOU HAVE IT.

59
00:03:15,818 --> 00:03:19,181
COVID NEGS, I'M GOING TO YOUR
WEDDING.

60
00:03:19,181 --> 00:03:21,966
AND FALSE ALARM MEDICAL ALERT.

61
00:03:21,966 --> 00:03:25,097
IF YOUR GRANDKIDS THINK IT'S THE
END, THEY'LL CALL.

62
00:03:25,097 --> 00:03:26,901
AND WHITE PIZZA.

63
00:03:26,901 --> 00:03:29,805
FOR WHEN ITALIAN IS TOO ETHNIC.

64
00:03:29,805 --> 00:03:34,172
OUR NEXT GUEST IS THE LATEST
VICTIM OF THE VACCINE POLICE

65
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:38,303
WITH A NAME I SOMEHOW HAVE AN
EASIER TIME LEARNING TO
PRONOUNCE THAN KAMALA HARRIS.

66
00:03:38,303 --> 00:03:40,846
PLEASE WELCOME NOVAK DJOKOVIC.

67
00:03:40,846 --> 00:03:46,295
>> YES.
OH, YES.

68
00:03:46,374 --> 00:03:49,797
CALL ME BY MY NICKNAME, THE
JOKER.

69
00:03:49,797 --> 00:03:52,604
ALTHOUGH RIGHT NOW I'M THE LEAST
POPULAR JOKER,

70
00:03:52,671 --> 00:03:54,498
EXCEPT FOR
JARED LETO.

71
00:03:54,588 --> 00:03:56,607
>> NOW I FOUND HIM RELATABLE.

72
00:03:56,718 --> 00:04:02,135
SO NOVAK, YOU WERE DEPORTED FROM
AUSTRALIA FOR REFUSING TO BE VACCINATED,

73
00:04:02,135 --> 00:04:05,901
AND I NEVER THOUGHT
I WOULD HEAR MYSELF USE THE WORD
DEPORTED IN A BAD WAY.

74
00:04:05,901 --> 00:04:07,481
WHAT HAPPENED?

75
00:04:07,481 --> 00:04:11,520
>> I WENT TO AUSTRALIA, AND MY
VISA WAS DENIED.

76
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:15,359
BUT THEN I APPEALED TO THE
JUDGE, AND THIS WAS HIS RULING.

77
00:04:16,017 --> 00:04:18,026
>> OUT.

78
00:04:18,942 --> 00:04:21,854
>> I MUST SAY, I AM A FAN OF
YOUR SPORT,

79
00:04:21,854 --> 00:04:24,413
BECAUSE IN TENNIS, LOVE
IS BAD.

80
00:04:24,413 --> 00:04:27,936
NOW, WHY DON'T YOU TELL YOUR
SIDE OF THE STORY

81
00:04:27,936 --> 00:04:31,573
WHILE I STARE
INTO THE CAMERA LIKE IT'S A RAW
PIECE OF STEAK.

82
00:04:31,573 --> 00:04:33,455
>> OH, THANK YOU, LAURA.

83
00:04:33,455 --> 00:04:37,551
YOU SEE,
PEOPLE LOVE TO TEAR YOU OFF YOUR
PEDESTAL

84
00:04:37,551 --> 00:04:41,219
JUST BECAUSE, YOU KNOW,
YOU'RE REALLY RICH OR YOU'RE THE
BEST AT TENNIS,

85
00:04:41,219 --> 00:04:45,922
OR YOU KNOW, YOU
GO TO A CHARITY EVENT WITH
200 KIDS EVEN THOUGH YOU'RE
DRIPPING WITH COVID.

86
00:04:45,922 --> 00:04:50,364
BUT IN MY HEART I KNOW THAT ONE
DAY PEOPLE WILL LOOK BACK ON
THIS MOMENT IN HISTORY

87
00:04:50,364 --> 00:04:52,498
AND THINK, "YEAH, WHO CARES?"

88
00:04:52,498 --> 00:04:54,744
THANK YOU, NOVAK.
SEE YOU AT WIMBLEDON.

89
00:04:54,815 --> 00:04:56,810
>> PROBABLY NOT.
>> YEAH.

90
00:04:56,810 --> 00:05:00,953
MY NEXT GUEST IS HERE TO ADDRESS
A VOTING RIGHTS BILL

91
00:05:00,953 --> 00:05:03,298
WHICH WOULD
MAKE IT EASIER FOR MINORITIES TO VOTE

92
00:05:03,298 --> 00:05:06,314
AND HARDER FOR WHITE PEOPLE
IN FLORIDA TO VOTE TWICE.

93
00:05:06,314 --> 00:05:10,655
PLEASE WELCOME MY ONE BLACK
FRIEND, CANDACE OWENS.

94
00:05:10,655 --> 00:05:13,853
>> MARTIN LUTHER KING WOULD HAVE
VOTED FOR TRUMP.

95
00:05:13,853 --> 00:05:16,921
>> HELLO TO YOU TOO.

96
00:05:16,921 --> 00:05:20,411
>> LAURA, LIBERALS ARE TRYING TO
MAKE EVERYTHING ABOUT RACE.

97
00:05:20,411 --> 00:05:23,727
TO QUOTE THE ONLY WORDS THAT
MARTIN LUTHER KING EVER SAID,

98
00:05:23,727 --> 00:05:25,153
I
HAVE A DREAM.

99
00:05:25,153 --> 00:05:27,847
THAT'S IT, END OF QUOTE.

100
00:05:27,847 --> 00:05:30,832
NOTHING ABOUT MONEY OR JOBS OR
SCHOOLS.

101
00:05:30,832 --> 00:05:35,645
UNLESS YOU COUNT HIS TOMBSTONE
WHICH SAYS, GREAT JOB, GANG,
RACISM OVER.

102
00:05:35,645 --> 00:05:37,970
>> I HOPE PEOPLE AT HOME ARE
WRITING THIS DOWN.

103
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:43,139
>> THANKS, LAURA.
IT'S MY GREATEST HONOR TO
CONTINUE THE FIGHT FOR AFRICAN AMERICANS,

104
00:05:43,139 --> 00:05:46,493
NO MATTER HOW MANY
TIMES THEY ASK ME TO STOP.

105
00:05:46,493 --> 00:05:49,125
>> THANK YOU, CANDACE.

106
00:05:49,125 --> 00:05:52,677
I'D LIKE TO THANK A FEW MORE OF
MY LOYAL SPONSORS.

107
00:05:52,677 --> 00:05:54,267
BIBLE BELT.

108
00:05:54,267 --> 00:05:58,439
HOLD YOUR PANTS UP THE WAY GOD
INTENDED.

109
00:05:58,471 --> 00:06:00,153
FLOWER POISON.

110
00:06:00,153 --> 00:06:03,957
EVER SEE A BIG GARDEN FULL OF
FLOWERS AND THINK, "I WISH THEY
WERE DEAD?"

111
00:06:03,957 --> 00:06:05,649
FLOWER POISON.

112
00:06:05,649 --> 00:06:08,642
AND PAULA DEEN'S CHICKPEA MASH.

113
00:06:08,642 --> 00:06:11,325
IT'S NOT RADICAL ISLAMIST HUMMUS,

114
00:06:11,325 --> 00:06:14,871
IT'S AMERICAN CHICKPEA
MASH.

115
00:06:15,123 --> 00:06:19,361
TALK OF THE 2024 REPUBLICAN
PRIMARIES IS ALREADY HEATING UP,

116
00:06:19,361 --> 00:06:23,928
SO LET'S TALK TO THE SVELTE, MUSCULAR,
230 POUND GORILLA IN THE ROOM,

117
00:06:23,928 --> 00:06:26,126
DONALD TRUMP.

118
00:06:26,126 --> 00:06:28,586
>> HELLO, LAURA.
HELLO, LAURA.

119
00:06:28,586 --> 00:06:32,126
IT'S WONDERFUL TO BE HERE.
I'M BACK LIKE "TIGER KING 2."

120
00:06:32,126 --> 00:06:34,331
YOU HAD FUN THE FIRST TIME, AND
NOW YOU'RE LIKE,

121
00:06:34,331 --> 00:06:37,425
"HOW ARE MORE
PEOPLE FROM THIS NOT IN JAIL
YET?"

122
00:06:37,425 --> 00:06:40,592
>> MR. PRESIDENT, YOU'RE OUT ON
THE TRAIL AGAIN,

123
00:06:40,592 --> 00:06:43,382
CREATING
CONTROVERSY WITH YOUR TYPICAL WACKO STUFF

124
00:06:43,382 --> 00:06:46,780
AND YOUR
UNCHARACTERISTICALLY REASONABLE
TAKES ON BOOSTER SHOTS.

125
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:49,012
WOULD YOU LIKE TO GIVE OUR
VIEWERS A TASTE?

126
00:06:49,012 --> 00:06:53,175
>> I SURE WOULD.
CAN WE GET TODAY'S WORDLE
PLEASE?

127
00:06:53,175 --> 00:06:56,405
>> I GOT THE BOOSTER, OKAY.
BECAUSE I MADE THE BOOSTER.

128
00:06:56,405 --> 00:06:59,315
IT'S A WONDERFUL VACCINE.

129
00:06:59,315 --> 00:07:02,873
BUT IT'S VERY UNFAIR WHAT IS
HAPPENING WITH THE COVID
TREATMENT, OKAY.

130
00:07:02,873 --> 00:07:07,768
WHITE PEOPLE ARE BEING TOLD TO
GET IN THE BACK OF LINE.

131
00:07:07,768 --> 00:07:10,709
SPEAKING OF WHITE PEOPLE,
JOHN MAYER.

132
00:07:11,529 --> 00:07:16,037
OKAY, JOHN MAYER HASN'T HAD A
HIT IN SO LONG, BUT WE LOVE
MAYER, OKAY?

133
00:07:16,037 --> 00:07:19,846
BODY WONDERLAND.
COME ON, I THOUGHT IT WAS
TREMENDOUS MUSIC.

134
00:07:19,933 --> 00:07:23,037
I THOUGHT IT WAS TREMENDOUS
MUSIC.
WITH "BODY WONDERLAND."

135
00:07:23,037 --> 00:07:27,082
YOU KNOW, I'D RATHER BE THE
MAYOR OF ANYTHING THAN BE
GOVERNOR RON DeSANTIS

136
00:07:27,211 --> 00:07:29,476
I BEAT HIM SO BAD.

137
00:07:29,476 --> 00:07:31,257
JUST LIKE I BEAT HILLARY.

138
00:07:31,326 --> 00:07:36,065
BECAUSE THE ONLY HILLARY WE LIKE
IS DUFF, OKAY?
FROM "HOW I MET YOUR FATHER."

139
00:07:36,065 --> 00:07:39,236
YOU KNOW WHAT, "HOW I MET YOUR FATHER,"

140
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:43,070
IT REALLY DOESN'T HAVE
THE CHARM AND SPARKLE OF,
FRANKLY, MOTHER.

141
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:45,192
OKAY?
BUT WE LOVE DUFF.

142
00:07:45,192 --> 00:07:48,598
YOU KNOW, SHE GOT HER TEETH
FIXED.
NOT LOOK LIKE

143
00:07:48,598 --> 00:07:52,188
AND "LIZZIE McGUIRE," YOU KNOW,
THEY WANTED TO DO A LIZZIE WITH HULU,

144
00:07:52,188 --> 00:07:54,882
BUT THEY SAID NO SEX,
THEY DIDN'T WANT SEX.

145
00:07:54,882 --> 00:08:00,017
SO THEY WENT THEIR SEPARATE WAYS
JUST LIKE LISA AND JASON MAMOA.

146
00:08:00,018 --> 00:08:03,594
BIG

147
00:08:03,594 --> 00:08:06,691
DEVIL

148
00:08:06,691 --> 00:08:10,392
AND "THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA."

149
00:08:10,392 --> 00:08:12,974
MY DAUGHTER
DAUGHTERS IS BY JOHN MYER.

150
00:08:12,974 --> 00:08:16,951
AND I'VE GOT TO RUN TO THE HOLES
OF YOUR HIGH SCHOOL IN 2024 WHEN
YOU RE-ELECT TRUMP.

151
00:08:16,951 --> 00:08:18,640
WORDLE!

152
00:08:21,989 --> 00:08:24,049
>> THERE IT IS, WE GOT IT.

153
00:08:24,049 --> 00:08:27,476
AND LIVE FROM NEW YORK, IT'S
SATURDAY NIGHT!

154
00:10:38,852 --> 00:10:43,903
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WILL
FORTE!

155
00:11:00,207 --> 00:11:04,181
THANK

156
00:11:04,683 --> 00:11:07,420
I AM SO EXCITED TO BE HERE
TONIGHT.

157
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:10,887
THIS IS MY FIRST TIME HOSTING
SNL.

158
00:11:13,989 --> 00:11:18,511
I WAS IN THE CAST 12 YEARS AGO
WITH KRISTEN WIIG, BILL HADER,

159
00:11:18,585 --> 00:11:22,904
ANDY SAMBERG, JASON SUDEIKIS AND
FRED ARMISEN.

160
00:11:24,713 --> 00:11:29,026
SO IT WAS REALLY FUN TO SEE
KRISTEN HOST.

161
00:11:29,026 --> 00:11:34,148
YEP.
AND BILL.
AND THEN ANDY.

162
00:11:34,148 --> 00:11:36,312
THEN FRED.

163
00:11:36,312 --> 00:11:41,189
THEN KRISTEN AGAIN.
THEN BILL AGAIN.

164
00:11:41,189 --> 00:11:43,530
THEN JASON.

165
00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:46,208
SETH MEYERS.
I MEAN, HE'S ONE OF MY BEST
BUDS, RIGHT?

166
00:11:46,208 --> 00:11:47,964
BUT, COME ON.

167
00:11:47,964 --> 00:11:51,309
HE WASN'T REALLY A SKETCH GUY,
HE WAS JUST ON "WEEKEND UPDATE."

168
00:11:51,309 --> 00:11:53,735
DOES THAT EVEN COUNT AS BEING ON
THE SHOW?

169
00:11:53,735 --> 00:11:56,115
BUT HE HOSTED.
RIGHT?

170
00:11:56,115 --> 00:11:59,012
JOHN MULANEY WAS A WRITER WHEN I
WAS IN THE CAST.

171
00:11:59,012 --> 00:12:02,344
AND THEN HE HOSTED FOUR TIMES.

172
00:12:02,344 --> 00:12:05,021
FOUR TIMES.
BUT HEY, THAT'S OKAY.

173
00:12:05,021 --> 00:12:09,343
I'M NOT BITTER ABOUT IT.
I'M NOT.

174
00:12:09,763 --> 00:12:13,036
SAVED THE BEST FOR LAST, RIGHT?

175
00:12:18,799 --> 00:12:22,877
>> SAVED THE BEST FOR WAY LAST.

176
00:12:22,877 --> 00:12:25,887
BUT, LOOK, AFTER 12 LONG YEARS,

177
00:12:25,887 --> 00:12:28,831
TONIGHT IT'S FINALLY MY TURN.

178
00:12:30,539 --> 00:12:32,708
MY TIME TO SHINE.

179
00:12:32,708 --> 00:12:36,554
TONIGHT IS ALL ABOUT ME.

180
00:12:44,394 --> 00:12:46,735
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

181
00:12:51,174 --> 00:12:54,235
KRISTEN.
HEY.

182
00:12:54,235 --> 00:12:55,860
YEAH.

183
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:58,882
>> WILL, I AM SO EXCITED THAT
YOU'RE HOSTING.

184
00:12:58,882 --> 00:13:01,255
>> NOT A GOOD TIME.

185
00:13:02,552 --> 00:13:04,127
>> OKAY.

186
00:13:04,672 --> 00:13:08,033
WELL, IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU.
BYE-BYE!

187
00:13:09,339 --> 00:13:13,011
SO -- SO I SHOULD GO?
>> YEAH, I THINK SO.

188
00:13:14,137 --> 00:13:16,181
>> I FLEW IN FOR THIS.

189
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:19,593
>> OH, GREAT, SO YOU KNOW WHERE
THE AIRPORT IS.

190
00:13:20,495 --> 00:13:23,873
>> ALL RIGHT.
WELL, BACK TO NORTH KOREA.

191
00:13:24,121 --> 00:13:26,839
IT WAS REALLY HARD TO GET OUT.

192
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:40,719
>> SO I DON'T LOVE
THAT SHE GOT MORE APPLAUSE THAN
WHEN I CAME OUT.

193
00:13:40,785 --> 00:13:43,944
YOU KNOW, I CAME OUT ONCE WHEN
SHE WAS HOSTING,

194
00:13:43,944 --> 00:13:45,683
AND I DID
SOMETHING IN HER MONOLOGUE.

195
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:49,506
BUT I WAS POLITE ENOUGH TO GET
LESS APPLAUSE THAN HER.

196
00:13:49,712 --> 00:13:55,166
YOU KNOW.
BUT LOOK, MY POINT IS, MAYBE THE
UNIVERSE HAD A REASON FOR MAKING
ME WAIT TO HOST.

197
00:13:55,166 --> 00:14:00,043
MAYBE IT WANTED ME TO WAIT UNTIL
MacGRUBER, THE SERIES, WAS
STREAMING ON PEACOCK.

198
00:14:03,789 --> 00:14:08,100
NOW, SPEAKING OF "MacGRUBER," I
WOULD LIKE TO OFFICIALLY ANNOUNCE

199
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:12,121
THAT "MacGRUBER" HAS
BEEN PICKED UP FOR A SEASON TWO.

200
00:14:17,104 --> 00:14:19,099
>> I WOULD LIKE TO ANNOUNCE
THAT.

201
00:14:19,099 --> 00:14:21,043
BUT IT HASN'T BEEN PICKED UP
YET, SO I CAN'T.

202
00:14:21,129 --> 00:14:23,020
YOU KNOW, WE'RE WAITING TO HEAR.

203
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:26,820
BUT I CAN ANNOUNCE THAT YOU'RE
IN GREAT HANDS TONIGHT.
YOU KNOW?

204
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:29,335
STRONG, VEINY COMEDY HANDS.

205
00:14:29,335 --> 00:14:33,231
AND, LOOK, IF I COULD JUST TAKE
A SERIOUS MOMENT.

206
00:14:33,231 --> 00:14:36,187
I'D LIKE TO SAY HOW MUCH THIS
SHOW HAS MEANT TO ME.

207
00:14:36,266 --> 00:14:41,465
I STARTED MY CAREER HERE, AND
THEY ALWAYS SUPPORTED ME.

208
00:14:41,555 --> 00:14:45,392
WAIT A SECOND.
ARE THEY PLAYING ME OFF?

209
00:14:45,392 --> 00:14:49,517
ARE YOU PLAYING ME OFF IN MY OWN
MONOLOGUE?

210
00:14:49,517 --> 00:14:52,846
I WAITED 12 FREAKING YEARS FOR
THIS.

211
00:14:52,846 --> 00:14:57,233
HAVE YOU SEEN SOME OF THE IDIOTS
THEY HAD HOST THE SHOW SINCE
THEN.

212
00:14:57,233 --> 00:15:01,389
KRISTEN, BILL, ANDY, FRED.

213
00:15:02,096 --> 00:15:05,043
ALL RIGHT, FINE.
I'LL TAKE ONE QUESTION.

214
00:15:05,043 --> 00:15:06,081
YOU, SIR.

215
00:15:06,125 --> 00:15:09,027
>> I'M SO SORRY, WILL.
THERE'S BEEN A MISTAKE.

216
00:15:09,027 --> 00:15:10,438
>> HEY!

217
00:15:28,751 --> 00:15:31,320
>> WILLEM DAFOE,

218
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:33,059
YOU'RE HOSTING NEXT WEEK.

219
00:15:33,059 --> 00:15:35,534
>> I'M PRETTY SURE IT'S THIS
WEEK.

220
00:15:35,767 --> 00:15:41,865
>> YOU THINK I'D BOOK SOMEONE
NAMED WILL, THEN SOMEONE NAMED
WILLEM?

221
00:15:41,865 --> 00:15:44,881
>> OH MY GOD, THIS IS NOT
HAPPENING.

222
00:15:44,881 --> 00:15:48,080
YOU TEXTED ME TO COME HOST,
LORNE.

223
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:51,775
>> I TESTED WILLEM, AND YOU
KNOW, AUTO CORRECT.

224
00:15:52,844 --> 00:15:54,757
>> ALL RIGHT, FINE.

225
00:15:54,757 --> 00:15:59,054
THEN LET'S HAVE THE FANS DECIDE
ONCE AND FOR ALL.

226
00:15:59,054 --> 00:16:04,360
DAFOE

227
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:07,097
>> OH, MY GOD?
5%?

228
00:16:07,097 --> 00:16:09,274
I GUESS PEOPLE DO LOVE ME.

229
00:16:09,274 --> 00:16:13,446
LOOK, WE HAVE A GREAT SHOW.
I'M HERE, MANESKIN'S HERE.

230
00:16:13,446 --> 00:16:15,952
SO STICK AROUND, AND WE'LL BE
RIGHT BACK.

231
00:16:23,544 --> 00:16:28,198
HE

232
00:16:28,229 --> 00:16:32,479
ANIMAL

233
00:16:32,756 --> 00:16:34,811
GENIUS

234
00:16:34,811 --> 00:16:37,805
GRUBER

235
00:16:37,805 --> 00:16:39,558
FEDERAL

236
00:16:39,575 --> 00:16:40,906
CONTROL ROOM

237
00:16:41,051 --> 00:16:43,869
SEALED.
WE'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE!

238
00:16:43,869 --> 00:16:48,518
>> MacGRUBER, IF WE DON'T
DISMANTLE THE C4 EXPLOSIVE, THIS
WHOLE BUILDING IS GOING TO BLOW
SKY HIGH.

239
00:16:48,518 --> 00:16:49,819
60 SECONDS.

240
00:16:49,819 --> 00:16:53,707
>> OKAY, DON'T WORRY, GANG, WE
CAN DO THIS IF WE WORK TOGETHER
AS A TEAM.

241
00:16:53,707 --> 00:16:57,948
AND LOOK, I KNOW THIS WHOLE
COVID SITUATION HAS REALLY CHANGED THE GAME,

242
00:16:57,948 --> 00:16:59,963
SO WE GOT TO
BE SMART ABOUT THIS, OKAY?

243
00:17:00,043 --> 00:17:02,641
WE'RE IN A SMALL ROOM WITH VERY
LIMITED AIRFLOW.

244
00:17:02,641 --> 00:17:04,313
>> GOOD CALL.
>> YEAH, GREAT THINKING,
MacGRUBER.

245
00:17:04,313 --> 00:17:07,073
>> OKAY, VICKI, PASS ME THAT OLD
TIN.
>> YOU GOT IT, MacGRUBER.

246
00:17:07,073 --> 00:17:09,297
>> PIPER, THAT LIGHTER FLUID.
>> COMING AT YOU, GRUBS.

247
00:17:09,297 --> 00:17:11,131
>> NOW BOTH OF YOU, HAND ME YOUR
MASKS.

248
00:17:11,131 --> 00:17:15,596
>> WHAT?
>> NO TIME TO EXPLAIN, MASKS
NOW!

249
00:17:18,496 --> 00:17:20,735
>> MacGRUBER, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING?

250
00:17:20,735 --> 00:17:23,364
>> FREEING US FROM TYRANNY,
VICK.
YOU'RE WELCOME.

251
00:17:23,364 --> 00:17:26,143
>> WELCOME FOR WHAT?
I REALLY WANTED TO WEAR THAT
MASK.

252
00:17:26,143 --> 00:17:29,025
>> YEAH, YOU JUST SAID YOURSELF
THAT WE'RE IN A SMALL ENCLOSED
ROOM.

253
00:17:29,025 --> 00:17:31,736
>> YES, SO WE NEED EVERY DROP OF
OXYGEN WE CAN GET,

254
00:17:31,736 --> 00:17:34,423
WHICH IS
IMPOSSIBLE WITH THESE STUPID
FACE DIAPERS.

255
00:17:34,478 --> 00:17:36,794
I CAN FINALLY BREATHE.

256
00:17:37,945 --> 00:17:40,424
>> I'VE GOT TO SAY I'M A LITTLE
UNCOMFORTABLE WITH THIS.

257
00:17:40,424 --> 00:17:43,001
>> DON'T WORRY, VICK.
I'M VAXED AND RELAXED.

258
00:17:43,001 --> 00:17:44,763
HERE'S PROOF.

259
00:17:44,763 --> 00:17:48,405
>> I THINK THERE'S A "P" MISSING
AT THE BEGINNING OF PFIZER.

260
00:17:48,405 --> 00:17:51,275
>> MADE OF A SIZLER?
>> SURE DID, PIPER.

261
00:17:51,275 --> 00:17:55,123
>> AND VICKI, IF THERE WAS A "P"
IN FRONT OF PFIZER, IT WOULD BE
PRONOUNCED P-FIZER.

262
00:17:55,123 --> 00:17:56,072
TRY

263
00:17:56,072 --> 00:17:57,598
>> JUST ADMIT YOU'RE NOT
VACCINATED.

264
00:17:57,598 --> 00:17:59,600
>> OKAY, FINE, YOU FREAKING
KAREN.

265
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,508
I'M NOT GETTING THAT STUPID
SHOT, ALL RIGHT,

266
00:18:01,508 --> 00:18:04,724
'CAUSE I DON'T
WANT THE GOVERNMENT PUTTING A
TRACKING DEVICE IN MY SCROTUM.

267
00:18:04,724 --> 00:18:06,913
>> MacGRUBER, YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT THE HELL YOU'RE TALKING
ABOUT.

268
00:18:06,913 --> 00:18:09,381
>> YEAH, I DON'T NEED TO KNOW
WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT, PIPER,

269
00:18:09,381 --> 00:18:11,147
BECAUSE I HAVE A BRAIN.

270
00:18:11,147 --> 00:18:14,637
BECAUSE YOU TWO SHEEPLE ARE SO
FREAKED OUT, LET ME ASSURE YOU,

271
00:18:14,637 --> 00:18:16,667
I'M TOTALLY ANTI-SEMITIC.

272
00:18:16,667 --> 00:18:20,043
>> I'M NOT SURE WE HEARD YOU
RIGHT.

273
00:18:20,043 --> 00:18:21,157
>> I DON'T HAVE ANY SYMPTOMS.

274
00:18:21,157 --> 00:18:23,519
>> I THINK THE WORD YOU'RE
LOOKING FOR IS ASYMPTOMATIC.

275
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:26,051
>> YES, THAT'S WHAT I SAID.
>> NO, IT'S NOT.

276
00:18:26,051 --> 00:18:28,272
>> NO, I DEFINITELY SAID I'M
ANTI-SEMITIC.

277
00:18:28,272 --> 00:18:30,664
>> YEAH, YOU DID.
>> SO WHAT'S THE ISSUE HERE?

278
00:18:30,664 --> 00:18:32,120
>> MacGRUBER, 10 SECONDS!

279
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:34,956
>> LOOK, WE MAY NOT ALL AGREE ON
THIS HOAX VACCINE,

280
00:18:34,956 --> 00:18:39,024
BUT ONE THING
WE CAN ALL AGREE ON IS THAT I DO
KNOW HOW TO DEFUSE BOMBS.

281
00:18:39,024 --> 00:18:40,417
>> 1 SECOND, MacGRUBER!

282
00:18:40,417 --> 00:18:42,140
>> OKAY, PIPER, HAND ME

283
00:19:14,482 --> 00:19:18,186
SUSIE IS OKAY.

284
00:19:14,482 --> 00:19:18,186
SHE'S BACK HOME, AND SHE'S OKAY.

285
00:19:14,482 --> 00:19:18,186
AND WE HAVE A BRAND-NEW "KID

286
00:19:18,186 --> 00:19:23,391
KLASH" CONTESTANT READY TO GO.

287
00:19:18,186 --> 00:19:23,391
MEET TATUM.

288
00:19:18,186 --> 00:19:23,391
>> HEY, EVERYONE.

289
00:19:23,391 --> 00:19:28,229
I'M THE SHORTEST AND THE SLOWEST

290
00:19:23,391 --> 00:19:28,229
ONE ON MY BASKETBALL TEAM, BUT

291
00:19:23,391 --> 00:19:28,229
HERE I'M GOING TO WIN, I'M

292
00:19:28,229 --> 00:19:32,500
TATUM.

293
00:19:28,229 --> 00:19:32,500
>> GREAT, 'TUDE, TATUM.

294
00:19:28,229 --> 00:19:32,500
AND TODAY'S PRIZE IS PIZZA FOR

295
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:36,638
LIFE.

296
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:36,638

00:19:43,211 --> 00:19:46,314
THE WHIPPED CREAM PIE TO FIND

THE FLAG.

00:19:55,724 --> 00:19:59,894
IT'S REALLY HOT.

313
00:19:59,894 --> 00:20:05,133

>> NOW, REMEMBER, YOU CAN'T MOVE

321
00:20:09,504 --> 00:20:14,642

322
00:20:14,642 --> 00:20:26,488
READY, SET, GO!

323
00:20:14,642 --> 00:20:26,488

326
00:20:26,488 --> 00:20:33,628
HERE'S A "KID KLASH" FACT ABOUT

327
00:20:26,488 --> 00:20:33,628

328
00:20:33,628 --> 00:20:40,969
YEAH.

329
00:20:33,628 --> 00:20:40,969
TATUM FAVORITE THINGS ARE

330
00:20:33,628 --> 00:20:40,969
SPAGHETTI AND BEACH BALLS.

331
00:20:40,969 --> 00:20:44,673
ALL RIGHT.

332
00:20:40,969 --> 00:20:44,673
TATUM, HAVE YOU FOUND THAT

333
00:20:40,969 --> 00:20:44,673
FLAG YET?

334
00:20:44,673 --> 00:20:46,808
>> NO, SO FAR JUST FEELING THE

335
00:20:44,673 --> 00:20:46,808
CREAM.

336
00:20:44,673 --> 00:20:46,808
>> WELL KEEP LOOKING.

337
00:20:46,808 --> 00:20:52,714
AND HERE'S A HINT, IT'S IN

338
00:20:46,808 --> 00:20:52,714
THERE.

339
00:20:46,808 --> 00:20:52,714
>> DO YOU NOT KNOW WHAT A FLAG

340
00:20:52,714 --> 00:20:54,149
IS?

341
00:20:52,714 --> 00:20:54,149
>> NO, I DO.

342
00:20:52,714 --> 00:20:54,149
>> THEN TRY TO FIND IT.

343
00:20:54,149 --> 00:20:58,753
>> I AM.

344
00:20:54,149 --> 00:20:58,753
>> ALL RIGHT.

345
00:20:54,149 --> 00:20:58,753
ANOTHER "KID KLASH" FACT.

346
00:20:58,753 --> 00:21:07,962
TATUM WAS DISQUALIFIED FROM THE

347
00:20:58,753 --> 00:21:07,962
CHILI COOK-OFF AT HER SCHOOL FOR

348
00:20:58,753 --> 00:21:07,962
LYING.

349
00:21:07,962 --> 00:21:12,334
ALL RIGHT.

350
00:21:07,962 --> 00:21:12,334
HOW ARE YOU DOING, TATUM?

351
00:21:07,962 --> 00:21:12,334
>> THE CREAM'S REALLY THICK, I'M

352
00:21:12,334 --> 00:21:19,107
WORKING PRETTY HARD HERE.

353
00:21:12,334 --> 00:21:19,107
>> WELL, DOESN'T SHOW.

354
00:21:12,334 --> 00:21:19,107
>> OH, MY GOD!

355
00:21:19,107 --> 00:21:21,543
OH, MY GOD!

356
00:21:19,107 --> 00:21:21,543
I THINK I FOUND SOMETHING.

357
00:21:19,107 --> 00:21:21,543
IT'S SOME KIND OF GOLD

358
00:21:21,543 --> 00:21:23,078
MEDALLION.

359
00:21:21,543 --> 00:21:23,078
>> AMAZING.

360
00:21:21,543 --> 00:21:23,078
BUT ONE QUESTION FOR YOU, TATUM.

361
00:21:23,078 --> 00:21:27,482
IS A MEDALLION THE SAME AS A

362
00:21:23,078 --> 00:21:27,482
FRIGGING FLAG?

363
00:21:23,078 --> 00:21:27,482
>> NO, BUT -- IT SEEMED LIKE

364
00:21:27,482 --> 00:21:31,186
MAYBE IT'S WORTH MORE THAN A

365
00:21:27,482 --> 00:21:31,186
FLAG.

366
00:21:27,482 --> 00:21:31,186
>> WELL, YOU'RE WRONG, TATUM.

367
00:21:31,186 --> 00:21:35,323
IT'S PROBABLY LEFT OVER FROM

368
00:21:31,186 --> 00:21:35,323
LAST WEEK'S SHOW.

369
00:21:31,186 --> 00:21:35,323
>> WHAT?

370
00:21:35,323 --> 00:21:47,669
YOU DON'T CHANGE THE CREAM?

371
00:21:35,323 --> 00:21:47,669
>> I DON'T KNOW, TATUM.

372
00:21:35,323 --> 00:21:47,669
BUT YOUR TIME IS UP IN 3, 2, 1.

373
00:21:47,669 --> 00:21:50,839
>> DANG IT!

374
00:21:47,669 --> 00:21:50,839
>> THAT'S OKAY, HONEY.

375
00:21:47,669 --> 00:21:50,839
>> DAMMIT, TATUM!

376
00:21:50,839 --> 00:21:52,974
>> WELL, I'M SORRY, EVERYONE, I

377
00:21:50,839 --> 00:21:52,974
COULDN'T DO IT.

378
00:21:50,839 --> 00:21:52,974
I COULDN'T FIND THE FLAG.

379
00:21:52,974 --> 00:22:00,849
>> AND WHERE DO YOU THINK YOU'RE

380
00:21:52,974 --> 00:22:00,849
GOING?

381
00:21:52,974 --> 00:22:00,849
>> I GUESS TO GET CLEANED UP AND

382
00:22:00,849 --> 00:22:06,154
GO BACK TO INDIANA.

383
00:22:00,849 --> 00:22:06,154
>> YOU'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

384
00:22:00,849 --> 00:22:06,154
NOT UNTIL YOU FIND THAT FLAG.

385
00:22:06,154 --> 00:22:10,291
>> BUT -- BUT THE TIME ENDED.

386
00:22:06,154 --> 00:22:10,291
>> LOOK, I DIDN'T START THIS

387
00:22:06,154 --> 00:22:10,291
GAME SHOW TO ENCOURAGE CHILDREN

388
00:22:10,291 --> 00:22:18,199
TO QUIT LIKE BABIES.

389
00:22:10,291 --> 00:22:18,199
NOW, I WAS VERY CLEAR.

390
00:22:10,291 --> 00:22:18,199
YOU GET OUT

391
00:22:18,199 --> 00:22:20,935
OF THE PIE WHEN YOU FIND THE

392
00:22:18,199 --> 00:22:20,935
FLAG.

393
00:22:18,199 --> 00:22:20,935
>> MOM?

394
00:22:20,935 --> 00:22:29,944
>> WE AGREE WITH HIM, TATUM.

395
00:22:20,935 --> 00:22:29,944
SHE NEVER SEES ANYTHING THROUGH,

396
00:22:20,935 --> 00:22:29,944
MR. ZASS.

397
00:22:29,944 --> 00:22:37,452
>> OKAY.

398
00:22:29,944 --> 00:22:37,452
I'LL KEEP TRYING.

399
00:22:29,944 --> 00:22:37,452
>> NOW, TATUM, AS I'M

400
00:22:37,452 --> 00:22:45,760
SURE YOU KNOW, YOU AND YOUR

401
00:22:37,452 --> 00:22:45,760
SHRIMP FAMILY ARE NOW INELIGIBLE

402
00:22:37,452 --> 00:22:45,760
FOR THE PIZZA FOR LIFE PRIZE.

403
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,430
>> SHOOT, THIS MUSIC IS

404
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,430
MAKING ME FEEL BAD.

405
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,430
>> AND I'M JUST NOW REMEMBERING

406
00:22:48,430 --> 00:22:54,402
THE PIE WAS SUPPOSED TO SPIN.

407
00:22:48,430 --> 00:22:54,402
CAN WE GET THAT GOING?

408
00:22:48,430 --> 00:22:54,402
>> WAIT.

409
00:22:54,402 --> 00:23:01,443
DOES THIS PART HAVE TO GO ON TV?

410
00:22:54,402 --> 00:23:01,443
>> TATUM, YOU KNOW THAT IT DOES.

411
00:22:54,402 --> 00:23:01,443
HOW DO YOU THINK

412
00:23:01,443 --> 00:23:03,111
IT'S GOING TO BE IN THE REAL

413
00:23:01,443 --> 00:23:03,111
WORLD, HUH?

414
00:23:01,443 --> 00:23:03,111
>> LIKE THIS, I GUESS?

415
00:23:03,111 --> 00:23:04,813
>> YEAH.

416
00:23:03,111 --> 00:23:04,813
THAT'S RIGHT.

417
00:23:03,111 --> 00:23:04,813
THE WHIPPED CREAM IS ADVERSITY.

418
00:23:04,813 --> 00:23:09,150
AND THE FLAG IS YOUR UNFULFILLED

419
00:23:04,813 --> 00:23:09,150
POTENTIAL.

420
00:23:04,813 --> 00:23:09,150
>> OKAY, WELL, I THINK I JUST

421
00:23:09,150 --> 00:23:17,859
GOT MY PERIOD.

422
00:23:09,150 --> 00:23:17,859
>> YEAH, YOU'RE NOT THE FIRST TO

423
00:23:09,150 --> 00:23:17,859
DO THAT IN THERE.

424
00:23:17,859 --> 00:23:23,064
>> WAIT, OH MY GOD, IS THIS IT?

425
00:23:17,859 --> 00:23:23,064
>> OH!

426
00:23:17,859 --> 00:23:23,064
SHE FOUND THE FLAG!

427
00:23:23,064 --> 00:23:31,072
>> IT'S SO SMALL!

428
00:23:23,064 --> 00:23:31,072
AND IT'S WHITE LIKE THE CREAM.

429
00:23:23,064 --> 00:23:31,072
THIS IS A REALLY BAD GAME.

430
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:33,742
>> NO.

431
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:33,742
IT'S GOOD!

432
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:33,742
WHEN WE RETURN, WE'RE GOING TO

433

00:23:33,742 --> 00:23:39,381
>> I'M ADOPTED?

436
00:23:39,381 --> 00:23:45,220
>> I'M ADOPTED?

437
00:23:39,381 --> 00:23:45,220
>> YES, YOU ARE.

438
00:23:39,381 --> 00:23:45,220
WITH BERIGHT BACK WITH MORE

439

>> SHOOT!
THIS VAULT DOOR'S WELDED SHUT.

446
00:24:06,789 --> 00:24:07,760
THERE'S NO WAY OUT.

447
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:10,242
>> AND FROM THE LOOKS OF OUR
DYNAMITE BOMB WE'VE ONLY GOT 60 SECONDS

448
00:24:10,242 --> 00:24:12,020
BEFORE THIS WHOLE
PLACE IS BLOWN TO BETSY.

449
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:14,240
>> NOT A PROBLEM, GANG.
WE GOT THIS.

450

DON'T WORRY.
AFTER THE LAST MISSION I'VE HEARD YOUR CONCERNS

AND NOW I'M

HOLE IN YOUR MASK.

453
00:24:22,336 --> 00:24:26,986
>> UH YEAH, SO I DON'T SUFFOCATE
FROM ALL THE CARBON DIOXIDE,
DUH.

454
00:24:27,187 --> 00:24:30,666
LOOK, THERE'S NO REASON TO BE
SCARED.
I'M GOING TO BE FINE.

455
00:24:30,666 --> 00:24:34,468
I'VE DONE A TON OF RESEARCH AND
I'M FOLLOWING THE SCIENCE NOW.
>> THAT'S GOOD.

456
00:24:34,468 --> 00:24:37,829
>> OKAY.

IT'S A COVID STRAIN MIXED

I AM REESE DE'WHAT!

488

IF YOU'VE HEARD THE PHRASE,

489
00:26:16,938 --> 00:26:22,677
GASLIGHTING, YOU PROBABLY KNOW

490
00:26:22,677 --> 00:26:29,117
IT MEANS TO MANIPULATE SOMEONE

491
00:26:22,677 --> 00:26:29,117
INTO BELIEVING A FALSE REALITY.

492
00:26:22,677 --> 00:26:29,117
BUT WHAT YOU MAY NOT KNOW IS

493
00:26:29,117 --> 00:26:42,130
THAT THE PHRASE ORIGINALLY COMES

494
00:26:29,117 --> 00:26:42,130
FROM THE 1944 FILM, "GASLIGHT,"

495
00:26:29,117 --> 00:26:42,130
STARRING INGRID BERGMAN AS A

496
00:26:42,130 --> 00:26:44,566
WOMAN WHOSE HUSBAND MAKES HER

SLOWLY DIMMING THE GAS-FUELED

499
00:26:44,566 --> 00:26:47,702
LIGHTS AROUND HER AND THEN

500
00:26:44,566 --> 00:26:47,702
DENYING IT.

501
00:26:44,566 --> 00:26:47,702
WHY DOES HE DO THIS?

502
00:26:47,702 --> 00:26:55,777
I DO NOT KNOW.

503
00:26:47,702 --> 00:26:55,777
AND I'M BAD AT GUESSING.

504
00:26:47,702 --> 00:26:55,777
LIKE WHEN MY WIFE ASKED ME TO

505
00:26:55,777 --> 00:26:57,579
GUESS WHAT SHE WAS MAKING FOR

506
00:26:55,777 --> 00:26:57,579
DINNER AND I SAID, I DON'T KNOW,

507
00:26:55,777 --> 00:26:57,579

00:27:23,038 --> 00:27:25,173
I'M NOT INSANE.

YOU GASLIGHT ME YET ANY LONGER.

617
00:30:06,835 --> 00:30:08,536
IN FACT, MAYBE I'LL GASLIGHT

618
00:30:06,835 --> 00:30:08,536
YOU.

619

THAT'S NOT A TIE YOU'RE WEARING.

620
00:30:08,536 --> 00:30:11,072

I GUESS I'M BAD AT IT.

625
00:30:19,681 --> 00:30:21,750
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU TOLD ME IT

626

679
00:32:01,449 --> 00:32:06,654

00:54:10,045 --> 00:54:19,888
WE'RE BOAT PEOPLE NOW, COLIN.

1373
00:54:10,045 --> 00:54:19,888
I MEAN, YOU ALWAYS WERE.

DOWNTOWN.

1384
00:54:25,293 --> 00:54:28,096
IT WILL EVENTUALLY SLIP IN

YOU KNOW, IT DOESN'T HAVE TO

1398
00:54:59,194 --> 00:55:02,297
MOVE UNDER ITS OWN POWER.

1399

** THROUGH HIM IN THE POOL

1421

1427
00:56:10,365 --> 00:56:22,877
** AND THE CAR BELONGED TO MY

** KEY CARD TO THE NEAREST BAR

1431

1432
00:56:33,088 --> 00:56:40,061
BECAUSE A SHAPE SHIP EXPLODED

1433
00:56:33,088 --> 00:56:40,061
** SO A DRANK A CASE OF BEER

1434

WITH A TODDLER.

1435
00:56:40,061 --> 00:56:45,066

NO, I'M SORRY.

1447
00:57:08,523 --> 00:57:14,496
I WAS RIGHT THE FIRST TIME.

1448
00:57:08,523 --> 00:57:14,496
THEY RELEASED A NEW ALBUM.

** OH, TODDLER DID YOU HEAR WHAT

1454
00:57:23,672 --> 00:57:31,813
I WHISPERED IN YOUR EAR ABOUT

1455
00:57:31,813 --> 00:57:39,821
THE SPACESHIP THAT WAS PARKED IN

1456
00:57:31,813 --> 00:57:39,821
YOUR YARD

1457
00:57:31,813 --> 00:57:39,821
** WITH A TURKEY AND A TOLD

1458
00:57:39,821 --> 00:57:47,095
** AND A FACE FULL OF REGRET

1459
00:57:39,821 --> 00:57:47,095
** BUT THEN A TRUCK PASSED BY

1460
00:57:39,821 --> 00:57:47,095
** AND NOW THE TURKEY IS BED AND

1461
00:57:47,095 --> 00:57:56,204
THE TOLD'S ON LIFE-SUPPORT.

1462
00:57:47,095 --> 00:57:56,204

01:04:18,134 --> 01:04:20,996
>> AND A HYDROGEN BOMB IS SET TO
BLOW IN 30 SECONDS!

1630
01:04:20,996 --> 01:04:23,244
>> SO WHERE WAS I?
OH, YES.

1631
01:04:23,244 --> 01:04:26,800
HOLLYWOOD CELEBRITIES ARE EATING
BABIES.

1632
01:04:26,800 --> 01:04:29,282
THEY DEVOUR THEM.
THEY'RE INSATIABLE.

1633
01:04:29,282 --> 01:04:31,469
LIKE THE WAY HORSE WORMS EAT
SPAGHETTI.

1634
01:04:31,469 --> 01:04:32,982
RAW BABIES, COOKED BABIES.

1635
01:04:32,982 --> 01:04:35,082
I'M SURE THEY HAVE A VARIETY OF
RECIPES.

1636
01:04:35,082 --> 01:04:38,636
THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING OUT
THERE AND NOBODY IS DOING
ANYTHING ABOUT IT.

1637
01:04:38,636 --> 01:04:40,094
>> CAN WE CONCENTRATE ON THE
BOMB?

1638
01:04:40,094 --> 01:04:43,930
>> OH, THAT'S NOT A BIG ENOUGH
BOMB FOR YOU TO FIND OUT THAT
ELLEN POMPEO EATS BABIES?

1639
01:04:43,930 --> 01:04:46,383
>> I KNEW IT.
>> YOU'RE SO BRAINWASHED.

1640
01:04:46,383 --> 01:04:49,214
>> I'M SORRY, IN WHAT WAY?
>> JUST LOOK AT HOW YOU'RE
DRESSED.

1641
01:04:49,214 --> 01:04:52,198
>> FORGIVE ME FOR NOT SHOPPING
AT CHEAPS-R-US LIKE YOU.

1642
01:04:52,198 --> 01:04:55,609
I'M JUST YOUR AVERAGE AMERICAN
WHO BELIEVES IN LIMITED GOVERNMENT, 

1643
01:04:55,609 --> 01:04:58,073
MY BODY, MY
CHOICE -- FOR MEN -- 

1644
01:04:58,073 --> 01:05:01,128
AND
SUPPRESSED VOTING RIGHTS FOR
ALTERNATIVELY SKINNED PEOPLE.

1645
01:05:01,128 --> 01:05:03,433
I'M NOT SURE HOW THAT MAKES ME
BRAINWASHED.

1646
01:05:03,433 --> 01:05:04,944
>> MacGRUBER, FOCUS.
PLEASE.

1647
01:05:04,944 --> 01:05:17,545
>> YOU'RE RIGHT, OKAY.

1648
01:05:17,545 --> 01:05:19,614
VICKY, HAND ME ALL THE REMAINS

1649
01:05:17,545 --> 01:05:19,614
OF AMERICA'S SOUL.

1650
01:05:17,545 --> 01:05:19,614
>> WHAT?

1651
01:05:19,614 --> 01:05:26,388
THERE'S NOTHING THERE.

1652
01:05:19,614 --> 01:05:26,388
WELCOME TO THE REAL WORLD.

1653
01:05:19,614 --> 01:05:26,388
LOOK, I'M JUST A SHAMAN.

1654
01:05:26,388 --> 01:05:28,556
>> ALL I CAN DO IS PRAY FOR YOU,

1655
01:05:26,388 --> 01:05:28,556
TAKE UP ARMS AGAINST YOU, AND

1656
01:05:26,388 --> 01:05:28,556
KEEP THE OATH I TOOK TO PROTECT

1657
01:05:28,556 --> 01:05:32,127
THIS COUNTRY.

1658
01:05:28,556 --> 01:05:32,127
BECAUSE I AM AN OATH KEEPER AND

1659
01:05:28,556 --> 01:05:32,127
BOY AM I PROUD OF THAT.

1660
01:05:32,127 --> 01:05:35,463
WHICH I GUESS MAKES ME A PROUD

1661
01:05:32,127 --> 01:05:35,463
BOY.

1662
01:05:32,127 --> 01:05:35,463
>> DO YOU EVEN UNDERSTAND WHAT

1663
01:05:35,463 --> 01:05:37,899
YOU'RE SAYING RIGHT NOW?

1664
01:05:35,463 --> 01:05:37,899
>> PROBABLY NOT.

1665
01:05:35,463 --> 01:05:37,899
>> MacGRUBER, IF WE DON'T DEAL

1666
01:05:37,899 --> 01:05:41,503
WITH THIS BOMB, WE ARE GOING TO

1667
01:05:37,899 --> 01:05:41,503
EXPLODE.

1668
01:05:37,899 --> 01:05:41,503
>> 5 SECONDS.

1669
01:05:41,503 --> 01:05:44,105
>> ACCORDING TO CNN.

1670
01:05:41,503 --> 01:05:44,105
>> 4 SECONDS.

1671
01:05:41,503 --> 01:05:44,105
>> CANCEL CULTURE.

1672
01:05:44,105 --> 01:05:46,241
>> 3 SECONDS.

1673
01:05:44,105 --> 01:05:46,241
>> NOT MY CLOCK.

1674
01:05:44,105 --> 01:05:46,241
>> 2 SECONDS.

1675
01:05:46,241 --> 01:05:50,612
>> HOLLYWOOD ELITE.

1676
01:05:46,241 --> 01:05:50,612
>> 1 SECOND.

1677
01:05:46,241 --> 01:05:50,612
>> THOUGH I DO KIND OF LIKE SOME

1678
01:05:50,612 --> 01:05:53,915
>> THOUGH I DO KIND OF LIKE SOME

1679
01:05:50,612 --> 01:05:53,915
STREAMERS ON PEACOCK.

01:05:50,612 --> 01:05:53,915
