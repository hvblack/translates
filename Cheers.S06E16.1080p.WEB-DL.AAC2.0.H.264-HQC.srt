1
00:00:01,516 --> 00:00:04,718
<i>Cheers is filmed
before a live studio audience.</i>

2
00:00:04,752 --> 00:00:09,570
English is, of course,
a member
of the Germanic sub-family
of the Indo-European...

3
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:10,956
Isn't this fascinating?

4
00:00:10,956 --> 00:00:14,038
Must be what TV's like
after you're dead.

5
00:00:14,662 --> 00:00:18,277
All right, Normie,
turn off that claptrap.
The cavalry has arrived.

6
00:00:18,277 --> 00:00:22,601
I just raided
Vincent's Video Emporium
for the finest
'50s sci-fi fare.

7
00:00:22,601 --> 00:00:25,922
Yeah, get ready
for a rollicking evening
of, uh, pod people,

8
00:00:25,956 --> 00:00:28,510
invisible monsters
and wisecracking robots.

9
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:31,645
Ooh... danger, danger!
Danger, danger!

10
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:33,522
I love this stuff. Yeah?

11
00:00:33,522 --> 00:00:35,401
Oh, now there's
one of my favorites...

12
00:00:35,401 --> 00:00:37,594
- Invasion of the Body Snatchers.
- All right. Good one.

13
00:00:37,594 --> 00:00:39,544
A particularly
trenchant analysis

14
00:00:39,544 --> 00:00:42,447
of the collective
American psyche
during the Cold War era,

15
00:00:42,447 --> 00:00:44,073
with the pod people representing

16
00:00:44,108 --> 00:00:47,151
the dehumanizing effect
of the McCarthy hearings.

17
00:00:48,029 --> 00:00:51,231
I guess we got, uh,
plenty of other movies there.

18
00:00:52,032 --> 00:00:54,768
<i>Here we go.
Day the Earth Stood Still...
a real classic. Oh...</i>

19
00:00:54,802 --> 00:00:57,456
<i>Klaatu barada nicto...</i>

20
00:00:57,456 --> 00:01:01,683
For my money, the finest
allegorical retelling
of the life of Christ on film.

21
00:01:01,683 --> 00:01:04,036
<i>Even better than E.T.</i>

22
00:01:04,678 --> 00:01:06,680
Next batter.

23
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:09,608
- Forbidden Planet.
- Well, that's a good choice.

24
00:01:09,608 --> 00:01:14,532
<i>It's a witty revamp of
Shakespeare's The Tempest
with Robbie the
Robot standing in
for the sprite Ariel.</i>

25
00:01:14,532 --> 00:01:16,793
Well, so what'll it be?

26
00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:22,379
This, then, was the height
of the literary use
of Middle English.

27
00:01:26,784 --> 00:01:29,269
¶ Making your way
in the world today ¶

28
00:01:29,303 --> 00:01:32,389
¶ Takes everything you've got.

29
00:01:32,423 --> 00:01:35,225
¶ Taking a break
from all your worries ¶

30
00:01:35,025 --> 00:01:37,961
¶ Sure would help a lot.

31
00:01:37,995 --> 00:01:42,297
¶ Wouldn't you like
to get away? ¶

32
00:01:44,012 --> 00:01:46,353
¶ Sometimes you want to go.

33
00:01:46,387 --> 00:01:50,617
¶ Where everybody
knows your name ¶

34
00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:55,849
¶ And they're always glad
you came ¶

35
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:58,782
¶ You want to be
where you can see ¶

36
00:01:58,784 --> 00:02:01,351
¶ Our troubles
are all the same ¶

37
00:02:01,385 --> 00:02:06,379
¶ You want to be where everybody
knows your name ¶

38
00:02:06,674 --> 00:02:09,208
¶ You want to go
where people know ¶

39
00:02:09,243 --> 00:02:11,744
¶ People are all the same.

40
00:02:11,779 --> 00:02:16,840
¶ You want to go where
everybody knows your name. ¶

41
00:02:37,237 --> 00:02:40,821
Check out Mr. Evan Drake
over there,
acting like
he owns the place, eh?

42
00:02:40,821 --> 00:02:44,304
Thinks that he's just
some, uh, big shot
corporate executive, eh?

43
00:02:44,304 --> 00:02:46,968
Doesn't have to pay attention
to the common man
like you and me?

44
00:02:46,968 --> 00:02:48,765
We're not important enough.

45
00:02:48,799 --> 00:02:52,827
Well, actually, Cliff,
if it helps
to alleviate this envy
that seems to be
eating you up right now,

46
00:02:52,827 --> 00:02:56,923
studies have shown
that rich people are
40 to 50% less happy
than most of us.

47
00:02:56,958 --> 00:02:58,558
Oh, come on, that's a crock.

48
00:02:58,593 --> 00:03:00,993
Well, of course it is, but we
have to cling to it, don't we?

49
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:04,581
Thank you.
Damn.

50
00:03:04,615 --> 00:03:08,166
Bad news?
Yeah, a very
important client and I

51
00:03:08,166 --> 00:03:11,755
were going to take
the corporate yacht
out for a little cruise,
but he had to hurry home.

52
00:03:11,789 --> 00:03:12,855
Illness in the family?

53
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:15,085
No, they overthrew
his government.

54
00:03:15,085 --> 00:03:16,893
Ah, on the weekend,
to boot, huh?

55
00:03:16,927 --> 00:03:20,281
Just can't make plans
with dictators.

56
00:03:20,781 --> 00:03:24,398
Sam,
why don't you join me?
We're heading out
to Martha's Vineyard.

57
00:03:24,398 --> 00:03:26,169
Oh, I'd love to.

58
00:03:26,203 --> 00:03:29,356
Why don't we make it
a romantic weekend, huh?

59
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:31,874
Oh, well, I'm flattered,
Evan, that's...

60
00:03:31,909 --> 00:03:35,878
No, no, no, no.
I meant bring Rebecca along.

61
00:03:35,878 --> 00:03:38,230
Rebecca? Why would
I want to do that?

62
00:03:38,265 --> 00:03:40,787
Well, the last I heard,
you two were a hot item.

63
00:03:40,787 --> 00:03:42,622
I'm not going
to hear any more about it.

64
00:03:42,622 --> 00:03:44,237
No, no, no.
You two are coming.

65
00:03:44,271 --> 00:03:47,440
Now, just call my secretary.
She'll give you all the details,
all right?

66
00:03:48,092 --> 00:03:49,910
Oh, Mr. Drake? Hmm.

67
00:03:49,944 --> 00:03:54,219
Um, I'm an insignificant cog
in the vast machinery
of your corporation.

68
00:03:54,219 --> 00:03:55,357
Nice to meet you.

69
00:03:55,357 --> 00:03:59,803
You being a rich
and powerful guy,
you might think you'd let
yourself get all fat and lazy,

70
00:03:59,837 --> 00:04:02,506
but you look like you keep
yourself in pretty good shape.

71
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:04,841
Well, I get to the gym
a few times a week.

72
00:04:04,875 --> 00:04:08,941
Good, good, then maybe
you can catch the truck
that's towing your Rolls.

73
00:04:12,032 --> 00:04:15,811
<i>I love to see rich people
haul butt.</i>

74
00:04:18,828 --> 00:04:20,717
Well, let's see here.

75
00:04:20,717 --> 00:04:25,792
What little mermaid
would like me
to scale her tail this weekend?

76
00:04:25,792 --> 00:04:27,453
What, you're not taking
Miss Howe?

77
00:04:27,453 --> 00:04:29,964
No, I thought I'd
have fun instead.

78
00:04:29,964 --> 00:04:32,163
I'm tired of barking
up that tree.

79
00:04:32,163 --> 00:04:33,970
I thought Mr. Drake
told you to take her.

80
00:04:34,005 --> 00:04:37,203
Well, I'll just, uh, tell him
we broke up, or something.

81
00:04:37,203 --> 00:04:41,076
Besides...
I got this, uh,
gorgeous dental hygienist

82
00:04:41,111 --> 00:04:45,047
that I've been
trying to impress,
and flossing every day
just isn't doing it.

83
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:49,537
She'll love this yacht thing.
She's, uh, into money
in a big way.

84
00:04:49,553 --> 00:04:51,971
It's amazing how superficial
some people can be, isn't it?

85
00:04:52,005 --> 00:04:56,202
Oh, tell me about it.
Good thing for her
she's got
a great set of hooters.

86
00:04:56,914 --> 00:04:58,562
Good luck. Mmm, thank you.

87
00:04:58,562 --> 00:05:01,750
Hold it, hold it...
hold it, hold it, hold...
Look, no, I'm
telling you, Normie,

88
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:05,340
recent research
into the Revolutionary War
indicates that

89
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:09,071
the, uh,
defenders of this area
were not called
the, uh, Minutemen after all.

90
00:05:09,105 --> 00:05:11,391
Oh, like every history book
is then wrong, right?

91
00:05:11,426 --> 00:05:14,743
<i>Oh, they were actually called
the Minute Men.</i>

92
00:05:15,288 --> 00:05:18,703
A lot of them
under three feet tall,
as a matter of fact.

93
00:05:18,703 --> 00:05:21,571
- Way back in history,
people were shorter.
- All right, fine.

94
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:23,831
Take, for example, the, uh,
the Knights of the Round Table.

95
00:05:23,831 --> 00:05:25,944
- Yeah?
- Genuine midgets.

96
00:05:25,944 --> 00:05:29,339
You're a very lonely man,
aren't you?

97
00:05:31,378 --> 00:05:34,480
Julie, sweetheart, come on,
it's the middle of winter.

98
00:05:34,515 --> 00:05:36,115
You're going
to have to bundle up.

99
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:38,912
I don't know, pack
a wool bikini, or something.

100
00:05:38,912 --> 00:05:41,254
All right.
Okay, bye-bye.

101
00:05:41,288 --> 00:05:43,121
Whee. All right.

102
00:05:43,156 --> 00:05:44,624
Julie is set.

103
00:05:44,658 --> 00:05:47,514
- Sammy, come here.
Let me see if I
got this straight.
- What?

104
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:50,257
- Drake invited you and Rebecca.
- Mm-hmm.

105
00:05:50,257 --> 00:05:52,608
Uh, Rebecca's got the
major hots for Drake.

106
00:05:52,608 --> 00:05:55,552
You take Julie
instead of Rebecca.

107
00:05:55,552 --> 00:05:58,373
Rebecca is left standing
alone on the dock.

108
00:05:58,373 --> 00:06:00,770
Hey, what's that in her hand?

109
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:03,992
Oh, must be your severed head.

110
00:06:04,545 --> 00:06:08,364
Uh, don't worry about it.
Rebecca's not even going
to find out she was invited.

111
00:06:08,398 --> 00:06:11,370
Well, Sam, looks like
we're going to be shipmates.

112
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:14,965
- What do you mean?
- I just saw Evan outside,
and he told me the good news.

113
00:06:14,965 --> 00:06:16,854
I'm going to be your date.

114
00:06:16,854 --> 00:06:19,625
Uh, well, here... uh...
here's the bad news.

115
00:06:19,659 --> 00:06:21,560
I've already invited
somebody else.

116
00:06:21,595 --> 00:06:23,212
Un-invite her.

117
00:06:23,246 --> 00:06:27,633
Sam, I have been dying
for this chance
to get to know Evan
in a social setting.

118
00:06:27,667 --> 00:06:31,154
He only sees me
as some tough businesswoman
in tailored suits.

119
00:06:31,188 --> 00:06:33,057
I want him to see me
in sportswear.

120
00:06:33,125 --> 00:06:36,325
No... you don't understand.

121
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,094
See, Julie is really
important to me.

122
00:06:38,128 --> 00:06:42,964
I've been working
like crazy to-to set
something up with her for
almost three days now.

123
00:06:45,352 --> 00:06:49,859
All right, all right.
I'll, uh, I'll call Evan
and I'll try to fix it up.

124
00:06:49,859 --> 00:06:52,992
I... what am... how am I going
to explain Julie tagging along?

125
00:06:53,027 --> 00:06:56,695
Oh, I don't know.
Tell him she's your sister.

126
00:06:56,729 --> 00:07:01,232
My sister? Rebecca, this is
a hot, gorgeous, sexy woman.

127
00:07:01,293 --> 00:07:04,253
Yeah, he'll believe that.

128
00:07:08,392 --> 00:07:12,280
Oh, this looks just marvelous,
Lorenzo, just marvelous.

129
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,605
<i>Grazie, signore.</i>

130
00:07:13,605 --> 00:07:17,918
Thanks again, Evan,
for, uh, making room
for my sister here
on such short notice.

131
00:07:17,918 --> 00:07:20,266
Yeah, I really appreciate that.

132
00:07:19,967 --> 00:07:23,533
This yacht must have
cost a fortune!

133
00:07:24,638 --> 00:07:26,855
Well, did it?

134
00:07:28,508 --> 00:07:32,456
Well, the important thing
is that it
gets me where I want to go.

135
00:07:33,513 --> 00:07:38,784
All I really need is
a boat beneath my feet
and a star to guide her with.

136
00:07:38,819 --> 00:07:41,346
And of course, a helicopter pad.

137
00:07:42,723 --> 00:07:44,854
Oh, you have a
beautiful laugh, Julie.

138
00:07:44,854 --> 00:07:47,298
Doesn't she brighten up
the old tub, Lorenzo?

139
00:07:47,298 --> 00:07:52,626
It is like a ray of sunshine
to have a woman as beautiful
as Miss Malone on board.

140
00:07:52,516 --> 00:07:54,941
Oh, and of course you, too.

141
00:07:56,934 --> 00:07:59,027
Oh, yeah, yeah, of course.

142
00:07:59,027 --> 00:08:00,356
Oh, thank you, Mr. Drake,
it's nice...

143
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:02,135
Wow, you must be very
proud of your brother.

144
00:08:02,135 --> 00:08:04,607
He was one heck of a
pitcher, I'll tell you.

145
00:08:04,721 --> 00:08:08,397
It's too bad he's
not playing now,
when he could be
making some real money.

146
00:08:08,397 --> 00:08:10,698
Isn't she sweet?

147
00:08:11,659 --> 00:08:13,815
You two are very
close, aren't you?

148
00:08:13,815 --> 00:08:17,001
Mm. Oh, yeah.
She's, um, like a sister to me.

149
00:08:17,791 --> 00:08:20,686
I'm afraid I didn't have much
in common with my brother.

150
00:08:20,686 --> 00:08:23,362
Oh, you, too...
same with my brother.

151
00:08:23,397 --> 00:08:26,482
Julie, you told me you
didn't have another brother.

152
00:08:26,516 --> 00:08:29,335
Well... Uh, well...
she doesn't, actually, but I do.

153
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:31,437
Well, well, it's
not actually his brother.

154
00:08:31,472 --> 00:08:35,258
They're just such close friends
that Sam likes to think
of him as his brother.

155
00:08:35,292 --> 00:08:37,914
We just don't have
anything in common, that's all.

156
00:08:39,312 --> 00:08:41,041
Everything is ready, sir.

157
00:08:41,041 --> 00:08:43,704
Ah. Ah. Hey!
Everyone help themselves here.

158
00:08:43,717 --> 00:08:45,268
I have to have
a word with the chef.

159
00:08:45,302 --> 00:08:47,932
Hey, I have three for him,
"Keep it coming."

160
00:08:49,639 --> 00:08:54,160
You know, this is kind of fun,
pretending to have this
whole different personality.

161
00:08:54,194 --> 00:08:57,230
If you like it, you might
want to get one of your own.

162
00:08:59,733 --> 00:09:02,518
Wow, would you look at this.

163
00:09:02,518 --> 00:09:05,304
Lobster, cracked crab, caviar...

164
00:09:05,338 --> 00:09:07,006
Hey, ham. Whoo!

165
00:09:09,693 --> 00:09:11,738
I wonder what this spread cost.

166
00:09:11,738 --> 00:09:15,365
You know, Julie, you
seem very concerned
with the price of things.

167
00:09:15,365 --> 00:09:17,299
Don't you find that
a little rude?

168
00:09:17,334 --> 00:09:20,409
Well, it's not like
I asked him how old he is.

169
00:09:20,409 --> 00:09:23,723
What do you think?
45? 50?

170
00:09:29,113 --> 00:09:31,114
Find anything to your liking?

171
00:09:31,148 --> 00:09:33,683
Actually, yes.

172
00:09:33,717 --> 00:09:35,985
So have I.

173
00:09:37,587 --> 00:09:40,134
So I guess your cabin
is that, uh,

174
00:09:40,134 --> 00:09:42,758
- really big one upstairs, huh?
- Uh-huh.

175
00:09:42,793 --> 00:09:44,527
Ah, I'd really like to see it.

176
00:09:46,096 --> 00:09:49,765
Well, maybe I could take
you on the captain's tour
right after dinner.

177
00:09:49,799 --> 00:09:51,904
Oh, I'd really like that.

178
00:09:51,904 --> 00:09:53,869
Do you think your
brother would mind?

179
00:09:53,904 --> 00:09:57,757
What brother?
Ah. Great.

180
00:09:59,883 --> 00:10:04,096
Tonight is the night. Yeah.
I can feel it in my bones.

181
00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:07,099
Right after dinner, I'm gonna
tell Evan how I really feel.

182
00:10:07,133 --> 00:10:09,101
Mmm. No, I'm gonna
show him how I feel.

183
00:10:09,135 --> 00:10:11,124
I'm going to seize the moment.

184
00:10:11,124 --> 00:10:15,809
Fine, do what you want.
Right about then,
I'm going to be
seizing Julie's headboard.

185
00:10:20,231 --> 00:10:22,090
Well...

186
00:10:22,519 --> 00:10:26,202
- May I propose a toast?
- Oh, yeah. Yes.

187
00:10:26,236 --> 00:10:29,636
To a night full
of promise and possibilities.

188
00:10:29,636 --> 00:10:32,469
Hear, hear. Hear, hear.
Hear, hear, yeah.

189
00:10:49,175 --> 00:10:51,504
Well, I hope
Lorenzo has seen to everything.

190
00:10:51,504 --> 00:10:54,997
- Julie, this is your cabin.
I hope you find it comfortable.
- Thank you.

191
00:10:55,031 --> 00:10:56,568
I'll check in on you later, sis.

192
00:10:56,568 --> 00:10:59,230
Oh, uh, that's okay.
I think I'm getting a headache.

193
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:03,174
Well, not to worry.
I'll just drop by
with the old family cure.

194
00:11:05,109 --> 00:11:08,176
Your cabin, you two.
Ah. Good night.

195
00:11:08,211 --> 00:11:10,696
Good night. Sleep tight.
Don't let the bedbugs bite.

196
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:14,667
I'm sure you don't have
bedbugs on this boat,
or any other kind of bugs.

197
00:11:14,701 --> 00:11:16,819
Do they even have bugs
at sea?
Well, maybe water bugs...

198
00:11:16,853 --> 00:11:18,804
Good night.

199
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:21,816
What is my problem? Huh?

200
00:11:21,841 --> 00:11:25,337
Every time I talk to him, I
sound like a complete idiot.

201
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:29,447
Sam?
Did you ever get
tongue-tied with a woman?

202
00:11:29,482 --> 00:11:34,019
Oh, sure, lots of times.
As a matter of fact, once we had
to go to the emergency room.

203
00:11:34,053 --> 00:11:36,821
- They do have bugs at sea.
- Oh, now...

204
00:11:36,856 --> 00:11:41,243
Hey, this is a great
room, isn't it?
Too bad I won't be using it.

205
00:11:41,277 --> 00:11:43,738
Yeah, well, if I get lucky,
I won't, either.

206
00:11:44,448 --> 00:11:46,095
Sam, do you have to do
that in front of me?

207
00:11:46,095 --> 00:11:48,684
What? Oh, I'm sorry,
but Julie's a dental hygienist.

208
00:11:48,718 --> 00:11:51,086
This is gonna be the first thing
she checks.

209
00:11:51,121 --> 00:11:53,054
Maybe the second.

210
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:57,328
You know, I love it
when you talk stupid, Sam.

211
00:11:57,994 --> 00:12:02,082
- Didn't she just say
she had a headache?
- No, no. For Evan's benefit.

212
00:12:02,082 --> 00:12:03,941
No, she's got the
kind of headache where you

213
00:12:03,941 --> 00:12:08,240
go straight to bed
and take a couple of
Sammys every four hours.

214
00:12:09,675 --> 00:12:12,468
God, I cannot believe
I'm sharing a stateroom
with you.

215
00:12:12,468 --> 00:12:15,486
- I will never get
any mirror time.
- All right, all right.

216
00:12:15,486 --> 00:12:17,562
Thank you. Just...

217
00:12:20,663 --> 00:12:22,343
Oh, what can I get you?

218
00:12:22,368 --> 00:12:24,803
Well, let's see.
Uh, today's my birthday.

219
00:12:24,837 --> 00:12:26,672
What's a good birthday drink?

220
00:12:26,706 --> 00:12:29,842
Oh, well, Sam always buys
a free beer
for people on their birthday.

221
00:12:29,876 --> 00:12:31,542
Hey, that's great.

222
00:12:31,542 --> 00:12:35,898
Uh, actually,
it's, uh, my girlfriend
here's birthday, too.

223
00:12:36,232 --> 00:12:39,650
Oh, well, she gets
a free beer, too, then.

224
00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:42,170
Funny thing is,
it's our birthday, also.

225
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:45,340
Oh, yeah, that's how we all met.
We were, uh, at the same party.

226
00:12:45,374 --> 00:12:50,279
Wow.
Free beers all around then, huh?

227
00:12:50,313 --> 00:12:55,150
Hey. Hey,
hey, hey, there,
Mr. Hoof and Mouth, will you
put your thinking cap on?

228
00:12:55,184 --> 00:12:58,803
Hey, what are the chances
of those four people
having a birthday
on the same day?

229
00:12:58,838 --> 00:13:00,923
The odds must be astronomical.

230
00:13:00,957 --> 00:13:03,092
I'm just glad
I was here to see it.

231
00:13:03,126 --> 00:13:05,193
Hey, hey... Woody,
Woody, Woody, Woody...

232
00:13:05,227 --> 00:13:07,596
Don't you think
it's the slightest bit
of a coincidence

233
00:13:07,596 --> 00:13:11,784
that those four people happen
to have the exact
same birthday as...

234
00:13:11,818 --> 00:13:13,675
Cliff and me?

235
00:13:17,867 --> 00:13:19,896
Really?

236
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:22,643
A pitcher will be fine.

237
00:13:22,679 --> 00:13:24,340
Two.

238
00:13:29,886 --> 00:13:34,156
You've been working
on your hair all this time,
and it still looks like that?

239
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:38,108
- Like what?
- Like something you'd surf on.

240
00:13:38,028 --> 00:13:39,851
Give me the brush.

241
00:13:39,935 --> 00:13:41,630
Get down.

242
00:13:42,832 --> 00:13:46,855
God...
am I really gonna have the guts
to go through with this?

243
00:13:46,855 --> 00:13:49,488
Yes, I am.
I have to.

244
00:13:49,488 --> 00:13:52,266
And now...
There you go.

245
00:13:52,266 --> 00:13:53,391
Yeah, that's great.

246
00:13:53,426 --> 00:13:55,000
This is really going
to be tricky tonight.

247
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,059
I have to create just the right
romantic mood
with Evan.

248
00:13:59,059 --> 00:14:01,275
Do you have any suggestions
on how I could do that?

249
00:14:01,275 --> 00:14:02,851
Oh, yeah, that's easy.

250
00:14:02,885 --> 00:14:05,719
What you do
is you knock on his door,

251
00:14:05,719 --> 00:14:10,024
and you tell him
that you're having trouble
sleeping,
that you need some air.

252
00:14:10,059 --> 00:14:13,562
And then you get him
to take a little stroll
around the deck with you,

253
00:14:13,596 --> 00:14:18,767
and then when the...
the moment's right,
you tell him you'd like
to see him naked.

254
00:14:22,105 --> 00:14:25,461
Works for me.
I'm out of here.

255
00:14:27,243 --> 00:14:29,124
Good luck.

256
00:14:31,198 --> 00:14:33,765
I-I was just heading up on deck.

257
00:14:33,799 --> 00:14:35,784
I was just going up
on deck, too.

258
00:14:35,819 --> 00:14:39,137
- I just changed my mind.
- I just changed my mind, too.

259
00:14:41,057 --> 00:14:45,338
Whoa-ho! That was quick.
Was it everything
you thought it'd be?

260
00:14:48,431 --> 00:14:49,999
Sam, don't be stupid.

261
00:14:49,999 --> 00:14:52,564
- All right, here I go.
- Go on.

262
00:14:56,650 --> 00:15:00,292
- I changed my mind,
decided to get some fresh air.
- Me, too.

263
00:15:00,326 --> 00:15:03,076
- Oh, but I forgot my...
- So did I.

264
00:15:04,014 --> 00:15:06,493
Would you do something
about that damn Julie?

265
00:15:06,493 --> 00:15:09,184
- What?
- She keeps heading up on deck
every time I open up the door.

266
00:15:09,185 --> 00:15:11,511
Julie? What the hell's
she doing?
We got a date.

267
00:15:11,511 --> 00:15:13,906
That would probably send me
to the rail, too.

268
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:16,108
Here I go again.

269
00:15:17,077 --> 00:15:19,561
You ready
for the Captain's tour?

270
00:15:19,596 --> 00:15:23,081
Oh, I don't know.
I don't think I'm dressed for it.

271
00:15:23,116 --> 00:15:26,601
Maybe you could help me
pick out something.

272
00:15:29,188 --> 00:15:31,757
- Oh, my God!
- What?

273
00:15:31,791 --> 00:15:35,460
I just saw Evan go
in Julie's cabin,
and my life has no meaning.

274
00:15:35,494 --> 00:15:39,848
- You're crazy.
- I'm not, I saw it.
Shoot me now!

275
00:15:47,539 --> 00:15:49,875
J-Julie?

276
00:15:51,510 --> 00:15:55,247
Uh, Sam,
I told you I have a headache.

277
00:15:55,281 --> 00:15:57,582
Oh, wait a minute. What...?

278
00:15:57,616 --> 00:15:59,820
Hey, Drake's in there, isn't he?

279
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:04,156
- Oh. Well...
- I don't believe this. What...?

280
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:07,042
You're-You're throwing me over
for that guy? Why?

281
00:16:07,076 --> 00:16:08,610
Just because
he has more money than me?

282
00:16:08,644 --> 00:16:12,231
More money
than I'll ever hope to have?
More money
than most of America h...?

283
00:16:12,265 --> 00:16:14,799
I'm losing this argument,
aren't I?

284
00:16:15,719 --> 00:16:17,451
Good night.

285
00:16:21,824 --> 00:16:25,156
I don't believe the
nerve of that woman.

286
00:16:25,156 --> 00:16:28,280
I believe it.
Of course I believe it.

287
00:16:28,314 --> 00:16:31,092
Because she is nothing more than

288
00:16:31,092 --> 00:16:33,456
Hey,
don't defend her to me.

289
00:16:36,422 --> 00:16:41,360
To think, you know, I
have wasted three days
on that lost cause.

290
00:16:41,394 --> 00:16:46,674
Three days?!
Try wasting two years.

291
00:16:47,183 --> 00:16:50,828
Two years of waiting
by the phone for him to call.

292
00:16:51,204 --> 00:16:54,907
Two years of making excuses
for why he didn't.

293
00:16:54,907 --> 00:17:00,229
Two years
of dreaming about him
and thinking about him.

294
00:17:00,263 --> 00:17:04,602
Living every
moment for Evan Gregory Drake.

295
00:17:04,834 --> 00:17:09,621
Wow.
Boy, you sure have me beat.

296
00:17:11,541 --> 00:17:16,545
I'm just so...
disappointed in him.

297
00:17:16,579 --> 00:17:18,413
Disappointed? Think how I feel.

298
00:17:18,448 --> 00:17:21,331
I mean, he's in there
boinking my sister.

299
00:17:25,966 --> 00:17:29,703
I am never gonna have a husband

300
00:17:29,703 --> 00:17:33,912
or babies.
Or a family.

301
00:17:33,946 --> 00:17:39,260
All I have is my stupid career,
And I don't even like it.

302
00:17:40,803 --> 00:17:42,443
Hey, come on now.

303
00:17:42,471 --> 00:17:47,297
Listen, you-you
are a-a beautiful,
intelligent woman.

304
00:17:47,297 --> 00:17:50,399
Oh, Sam, please, not now.

305
00:17:50,399 --> 00:17:53,081
What? Oh, come on.
What-What you think that I'm...?

306
00:17:53,115 --> 00:17:57,883
Listen, I made a lot
of stupid passes at you,
but this is not one of them.

307
00:17:57,987 --> 00:18:03,458
Hey...
...you are a terrific person.

308
00:18:03,492 --> 00:18:05,818
You know, a lot of good
things are gonna happen,

309
00:18:05,818 --> 00:18:08,780
and I'm sure the right
person's gonna come along.

310
00:18:08,815 --> 00:18:11,782
Well, what if he already did,
and I didn't know it

311
00:18:11,782 --> 00:18:14,136
Because of Evan?

312
00:18:14,221 --> 00:18:18,563
Well, then, if you miss him,
then he wasn't the right person.

313
00:18:23,379 --> 00:18:27,549
Really?
Yeah, really.

314
00:18:28,885 --> 00:18:31,016
Really?

315
00:18:37,493 --> 00:18:40,094
listen you're in a very, uh...

316
00:18:41,364 --> 00:18:46,101
emotional state
right now, and I...
I don't want to take
advantage of that.

317
00:18:46,135 --> 00:18:50,153
If you want me to
leave, you just say so.

318
00:18:53,943 --> 00:18:57,245
I don't seem to be
saying anything.

319
00:19:05,604 --> 00:19:09,426
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- No, it's all
right, Evan, come in.

320
00:19:11,995 --> 00:19:14,946
Well, I can't sleep until
I get something off my chest.

321
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:17,907
Well, read a book, man, and-and get
back to us in about three hours, huh?

322
00:19:17,907 --> 00:19:19,634
No, no. Go on, Evan.

323
00:19:19,668 --> 00:19:21,174
Sam...

324
00:19:21,404 --> 00:19:24,016
I got where I am in life

325
00:19:24,016 --> 00:19:28,276
because I have always
dealt honestly
with people I respect.

326
00:19:28,311 --> 00:19:30,995
Hey, that's great. Can we talk
about it in the morning, please?

327
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:34,067
Sam, I tried
to seduce your sister.

328
00:19:34,833 --> 00:19:38,282
Oh, well, that's a...
that's a shocker.
Um, may...

329
00:19:38,704 --> 00:19:40,755
maybe we ought
to sleep on it, huh?

330
00:19:40,790 --> 00:19:44,104
Sam, please, give me
my day in court, will you?

331
00:19:44,294 --> 00:19:46,645
You see, I...

332
00:19:46,679 --> 00:19:51,248
Well, since
my marriage broke up,
I have been feeling lonely.

333
00:19:52,201 --> 00:19:54,835
Still, a man gets urges.

334
00:19:54,835 --> 00:19:56,938
But
I guess
I'm just too old-fashioned

335
00:19:56,972 --> 00:20:00,392
to think I can find
any real happiness that way.

336
00:20:00,426 --> 00:20:02,760
Nothing happened, Sam.

337
00:20:02,795 --> 00:20:05,363
Oh... And I just
wanted to explain
that to you, so, uh...

338
00:20:06,032 --> 00:20:07,413
Uh, excuse me.

339
00:20:07,413 --> 00:20:10,760
- Well... Good night.
- Yeah, yeah, good night.

340
00:20:11,654 --> 00:20:15,724
All right. Now...
All right, okay.

341
00:20:15,758 --> 00:20:17,659
Where were we here?

342
00:20:17,694 --> 00:20:22,315
I have never loved that man
more than I do
right at this very minute.

343
00:20:23,682 --> 00:20:25,867
Me, neither.
So where were we?

344
00:20:25,901 --> 00:20:28,586
God, he needs someone so badly.

345
00:20:28,586 --> 00:20:33,030
Oh, come on!
I haven't used that
"men have urges" line
since I was in the fifth grade.

346
00:20:33,030 --> 00:20:35,120
Excuse me, Sam.

347
00:20:36,112 --> 00:20:38,963
What? Come on! What
are you gonna do?
You gonna go chasing after him?

348
00:20:38,998 --> 00:20:41,350
No, no, no.
It isn't the right time.

349
00:20:41,384 --> 00:20:43,199
I just have to think.

350
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,588
I'm gonna go up on deck
and sleep and look at the stars.

351
00:20:46,622 --> 00:20:48,439
Uh, li-listen, you can't...

352
00:20:48,791 --> 00:20:52,172
You can't just work
me up like that,
and then walk out
of here. Please.

353
00:20:52,172 --> 00:20:53,555
Sam... No, please.

354
00:20:53,555 --> 00:20:57,663
I believe you have a sister
with a vacancy sign on her door.

355
00:20:58,422 --> 00:21:00,886
Right, right.

356
00:21:03,756 --> 00:21:06,808
Say hello to the stars
for me there, sweetheart.

357
00:21:06,842 --> 00:21:09,460
Boy, this... Okay, all right.

358
00:21:12,693 --> 00:21:14,171
Um, Julie?

359
00:21:14,171 --> 00:21:18,517
Listen, uh,
why don't we let bygones
be bygones here?

360
00:21:18,517 --> 00:21:20,994
Um, you were tempted,
I was tempted,

361
00:21:20,994 --> 00:21:24,609
but what the hell?
We're both
consenting adults, huh?

362
00:21:24,644 --> 00:21:28,977
I sure hope there's, uh,
some room
in that bunk of yours for me.

363
00:21:29,149 --> 00:21:31,437
There isn't.

364
00:21:34,737 --> 00:21:37,238
I got to stay off boats, man.

365
00:21:42,345 --> 00:21:44,095
Hello.

366
00:21:44,129 --> 00:21:46,798
Hey, Carla.
Did you pick
your mother-in-law up?

367
00:21:46,832 --> 00:21:50,818
Yeah.
I tried to pawn her off
on some Hare Krishnas,

368
00:21:50,853 --> 00:21:54,519
but I think she's the only thing
they won't take at the airport.

369
00:21:54,957 --> 00:21:57,709
- So, how's it been going?
- Oh, fine.

370
00:21:57,743 --> 00:22:02,564
Well, they tried to pull
that old birthday gag
where they get a
free round of beers,

371
00:22:02,598 --> 00:22:04,917
but I caught on
after the fifth round.

372
00:22:04,917 --> 00:22:09,304
Oh, Gomer, Gomer, Gomer.
Geez!

373
00:22:09,338 --> 00:22:13,905
Well, lucky for me, I remembered
that Mr. Clavin and Mr. Peterson
already had their birthday.

374
00:22:13,963 --> 00:22:17,179
Those foam suckers
were in on this?!

375
00:22:17,213 --> 00:22:19,147
That does it. Where are they?

376
00:22:19,181 --> 00:22:21,633
Hey, hey, hey.
I want to talk to you.

377
00:22:21,667 --> 00:22:23,919
Nobody stiffs this bar.

378
00:22:25,616 --> 00:22:28,399
You owe me
for five rounds.

379
00:22:33,992 --> 00:22:37,065
All right, Cliffie, we split up.
There's no way
she can catch both of us.

380
00:22:37,099 --> 00:22:39,500
Norm-Norm, she's... she's gonna
come after me first, Normie.

381
00:22:39,534 --> 00:22:41,636
Yeah. Ready? No,
no, no, no, no, no.

382
00:22:42,755 --> 00:22:44,758
No. Get back here. Get...

383
00:22:46,225 --> 00:22:49,345
Hey!
Where's the tip?

384
00:24:11,513 --> 00:24:31,346
translate
