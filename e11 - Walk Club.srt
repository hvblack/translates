1
00:00:01,454 --> 00:00:04,309
Hey girl.
Hey.
Oh, hey mama.

2
00:00:04,309 --> 00:00:08,159
Okay.
First meeting of culde-sac queens club.
What?
What?

3
00:00:08,159 --> 00:00:12,159
I needed this y'all.
Some fun out of the house away from the kids.

4
00:00:12,159 --> 00:00:14,990
Oh, amen, sister.
Let's get those steps in, girls.

5
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:16,523
Let's do it.

6
00:00:16,523 --> 00:00:20,736
Beth, I couldn't help but noticing you're wearing one of those cool weighted vests.

7
00:00:20,736 --> 00:00:23,231
Oh, I sure am.
I got it off the Tik Tok shop.

8
00:00:23,231 --> 00:00:25,957
Kind of fun, right?
This thing is heavy.

9
00:00:26,041 --> 00:00:29,230
Oh, wait.
You are.
Me, too.
Look.

10
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:32,143
Oh, okay.
Queen.
Heck yeah.

11
00:00:32,143 --> 00:00:35,997
Yeah.
I love how it takes a simple, pleasurable part of everyday life

12
00:00:35,997 --> 00:00:37,730
and just makes it awful.

13
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:41,420
What weight you reckoning, Carol?
Oh, this is a 10 lb.

14
00:00:41,479 --> 00:00:44,327
Oh, okay.

15
00:00:44,327 --> 00:00:46,577
What about you?
30.

16
00:00:46,577 --> 00:00:49,661
This is a 30 lb.
So, it's more.

17
00:00:49,753 --> 00:00:53,688
Oh, okay.
Gotcha.
Very nice.
Very nice.

18
00:00:53,688 --> 00:00:56,898
Yeah.
Yeah, I read the 10 lb doesn't really do much.
So

19
00:00:56,898 --> 00:00:59,501
Oh, well, I've got the bangles, too.
Weighted bangles.

20
00:00:59,501 --> 00:01:02,978
So, I have those as well.
And the feet.
I have the feet bangles, too.

21
00:01:02,978 --> 00:01:04,703
Well, I don't like you very much.

22
00:01:04,703 --> 00:01:08,188
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay, ladies.
This isn't a competition.

23
00:01:08,188 --> 00:01:10,583
Okay, Mom.
Welcome.

24
00:01:13,294 --> 00:01:17,072
Sorry I'm late.
My pop pong punky plotty class went crazy long.

25
00:01:17,072 --> 00:01:20,187
Oh, you just did plotties.
How did you do all that?

26
00:01:20,187 --> 00:01:21,435
Little thing called coffee.

27
00:01:21,435 --> 00:01:24,474
Just kidding.
I'm just not lazy.

28
00:01:26,744 --> 00:01:31,033
Oh, Michelle, don't tell me you're wearing a little weighted vest as well.

29
00:01:31,033 --> 00:01:34,024
Oh gosh, no.
This is a 200lb carbonite suit.

30
00:01:34,024 --> 00:01:35,523
Got it off the Tik Tok shop.

31
00:01:35,523 --> 00:01:39,057
And get this, the previous owner disarmed Rosie bombs with it.

32
00:01:39,057 --> 00:01:41,485
Oh, I love her locker.

33
00:01:41,485 --> 00:01:45,421
It helps my core, keeps my posture, and it keeps my heart rate at a steady 320.

34
00:01:45,421 --> 00:01:47,760
Every step is hell, and I'm having a blast.

35
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:50,306
Well, dang it.
Now I want one.

36
00:01:50,306 --> 00:01:52,613
Oh, you want my extras?
Here.

37
00:01:54,559 --> 00:01:56,475
We lost one.

38
00:01:56,475 --> 00:01:58,744
You know they call it rucking.

39
00:01:58,744 --> 00:02:02,268
- What?
- Walking with a weighted vest or backpack.

40
00:02:02,268 --> 00:02:04,997
It's rucking as in get this rucking thing off me.

41
00:02:04,997 --> 00:02:07,246
Oh, hey.
Hey.

42
00:02:07,246 --> 00:02:09,068
There she is.

43
00:02:09,068 --> 00:02:11,356
You're rocking a weighted suit, too, Katie.

44
00:02:11,356 --> 00:02:13,726
Oh, nope.
I just thought it was Halloween today.

45
00:02:13,726 --> 00:02:17,237
I've been working out so much I just keep forgetting what day it is.

46
00:02:17,237 --> 00:02:19,093
Oh, right.

47
00:02:19,093 --> 00:02:21,922
Katie, did I see you and Paul just renewed your vows?

48
00:02:21,922 --> 00:02:24,042
- We did.
- He's so nice.

49
00:02:24,042 --> 00:02:27,165
What did he do that made you feel like he needed to do that again?

50
00:02:27,165 --> 00:02:29,136
So, it's actually a funny story.

51
00:02:29,136 --> 00:02:32,485
On my birthday, he tipped a girl on only fans our car.

52
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:34,652
Oh, happy birthday.

53
00:02:34,652 --> 00:02:37,747
Hey, Mama's Party Rock is in the house tonight.

54
00:02:37,747 --> 00:02:41,211
- Marie, what you got there?
- It's called a hell rack.

55
00:02:41,211 --> 00:02:43,515
400 lb of pure hell.

56
00:02:43,515 --> 00:02:45,749
I got it off the Tik Tok shop.

57
00:02:45,749 --> 00:02:48,515
It crunches my spine, but the body is tea,

58
00:02:48,515 --> 00:02:51,823
- as in the shape of a tea.
- Absolutely girl.

59
00:02:51,823 --> 00:02:55,037
Uh-oh.
Dad incoming.

60
00:02:55,037 --> 00:02:56,713
There he is.

61
00:02:56,713 --> 00:02:58,151
Sorry to crash your party.

62
00:02:58,151 --> 00:03:02,505
I heard we were lugging enormous amounts of weight around for pleasure and had to join in.

63
00:03:02,505 --> 00:03:04,274
Oh, where's your vest, Mont Frera?

64
00:03:04,274 --> 00:03:09,096
Oh, actually, fun fact, I am sporting a weighted butt plug.

65
00:03:09,096 --> 00:03:11,132
Yep.
It's called butt rocking.

66
00:03:11,132 --> 00:03:14,162
- Never heard of that.
- Oh, it's the latest thing.

67
00:03:14,162 --> 00:03:16,534
Got it off the dark web.

68
00:03:16,534 --> 00:03:19,883
180 lbs in my ass.

69
00:03:19,883 --> 00:03:23,213
I feel awful, but I'm pretty hard.

70
00:03:23,213 --> 00:03:26,405
Oh, good for you, Phil.

71
00:03:26,405 --> 00:03:28,338
Carol's rocking the 10 lb.

72
00:03:28,338 --> 00:03:30,756
- I literally will kill you.
- Sure.

73
00:03:30,756 --> 00:03:32,956
Hey, how far have we gone?

74
00:03:32,956 --> 00:03:37,537
Looks like less than two blocks.

75
00:03:37,851 --> 00:03:39,255
Well, that's enough for me.

76
00:03:39,255 --> 00:03:41,249
Yeah.
Uh, this is my stop, ladies.

77
00:03:41,249 --> 00:03:43,757
Getting pretty close to a school zone. So,

78
00:03:43,757 --> 00:03:46,430
yes.
Well, we should totally do this again sometime.

79
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:48,168
Oh, I would love

80
00:03:48,168 --> 00:03:50,648
Oh gosh.
Well, I love you girlies.

81
00:03:50,648 --> 00:03:52,699
- I hate you.
- Hate all of you.

82
00:03:52,699 --> 00:03:56,484
- Very mean group.
- Not a fan.
