1
00:00:02,861 --> 00:00:06,449
DISTRICT COURT

2
00:00:07,595 --> 00:00:12,594
>>> OKAY.
OKAY.
EVERYONE, SETTLE DOWN.
SETTLE DOWN.

3
00:00:12,594 --> 00:00:16,349
MY NAME IS ALINA HABBA.
I'M THE ATTORNEY FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP

4
00:00:16,349 --> 00:00:19,570
IN THE SECOND DEFAMATION
TRIAL OF E. JEAN CARROLL.

5
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:23,352
THE JUDGE HAS BEEN VERY UNFAIR
FROM THE BEGINNING,

6
00:00:23,352 --> 00:00:25,436
AND I WANT
TO MAKE THIS PERFECTLY CLEAR,

7
00:00:25,436 --> 00:00:29,910
I AM NEW AT THIS, AND I AM
LEARNING.

8
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:33,907
NOW, THE PRESIDENT MAY OR MAY
NOT STOP FOR BRIEF REMARKS,

9
00:00:33,907 --> 00:00:36,820
BUT
DUE TO A STRICT GAG ORDER, HE
WILL NOT BE COMMENTING

10
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:41,072
ON
ANYTHING PERTAINING TO THIS
CASE, MS. CARROLL, OR THE JUDGE.

11
00:00:41,072 --> 00:00:42,640
HE

12
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,691
>> THANK YOU, ALINA.
YOU'RE GREAT ON TV.

13
00:00:46,691 --> 00:00:50,851
MAYBE THE WORST LAWYER I'VE EVER
HAD, WHICH IS QUITE AN
ACCOMPLISHMENT.

14
00:00:50,851 --> 00:00:54,306
LOOK AT THIS TEAM.
THIS IS THE BOTTOM OF THE
BARREL, FOLKS.

15
00:00:54,306 --> 00:00:56,128
THIS IS WHO SAID YES.

16
00:00:56,128 --> 00:01:00,045
I'M IN THE LEAD FOR PRESIDENT,
AND THIS IS THE BEST I CAN GET.

17
00:01:00,045 --> 00:01:02,734
FEELS LIKE A RED FLAG, NO?

18
00:01:02,734 --> 00:01:05,152
WELL, YOU'RE NOT GETTING PAID BY
THE WAY.

19
00:01:05,152 --> 00:01:06,858
YOU KNOW THAT?
OF COURSE YOU DO.

20
00:01:06,858 --> 00:01:09,087
ALL RIGHT.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU, GUYS.

21
00:01:09,087 --> 00:01:11,810
SEE YOU AT SHAKY'S.
YOU CAN GET OUT OF HERE.

22
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:14,644
BUT WE ARE HERE AT COURTHOUSE,

23
00:01:14,644 --> 00:01:19,594
AND, YES, WE WILL BE ABIDING BY
THIS HORRIBLE GAG ORDER,

24
00:01:19,594 --> 00:01:24,029
SO I
WILL NOT BE SAYING THAT THE
JUDGE IS AN IDIOT

25
00:01:24,029 --> 00:01:27,619
OR WHERE HE
LIVES OR WHAT KIND OF CRAPPY CAR
HE DRIVES.

26
00:01:27,619 --> 00:01:30,440
I DIDN'T KNOW THEY STILL MADE
WAGONEERS, BUT

27
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:33,161
IT'S A TERRIBLE
TIME FOR OUR COUNTRY.

28
00:01:33,161 --> 00:01:36,943
I AM STANDING WEIRDER THAN EVER.

29
00:01:37,145 --> 00:01:42,062
ARMS LIKE A GI JOE, LEGS LIKE
THE SMOOTH CRIMINAL VIDEO.

30
00:01:42,062 --> 00:01:46,083
LOOK LIKE I'M ALWAYS IN SKI
BOOTS.
MAKE IT MAKE SENSE.

31
00:01:46,083 --> 00:01:47,878
WE JUST GOT BACK FROM IOWA

32
00:01:47,878 --> 00:01:51,445
WHERE WE WON VERY BIG, VERY BIG IN
IOWA.

33
00:01:51,445 --> 00:01:54,222
I WANT TO CONGRATULATE MR. DeSANTIS

34
00:01:54,222 --> 00:01:57,522
ON A TRULY
EMBARRASSING SHOWING.

35
00:01:57,594 --> 00:02:02,086
HE WENT TO 99 COUNTIES, BUT
BITCH COULDN'T WIN ONE.

36
00:02:02,086 --> 00:02:04,773
RON DESTUPID.

37
00:02:04,773 --> 00:02:09,373
RON DESTUPID.
IT JUST WORKS.
WE'RE GOING WITH RON DESTUPID.

38
00:02:09,373 --> 00:02:12,741
ALSO WANT TO CONGRATULATE
MR. RAMASWAMY.

39
00:02:12,741 --> 00:02:17,223
VIVEKAA. RAMASWAMY WHO DROPPED
OUT OF THE RACE

40
00:02:17,223 --> 00:02:19,730
AND HAS AGREED
TO LIVE IN MY SUIT POCKET.

41
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:22,589
I LOVE MY LITTLE RATATOUILLE.

42
00:02:22,589 --> 00:02:27,486
AS YOU CAN SEE, I AM DOING VERY
WELL COGNITIVELY.

43
00:02:27,486 --> 00:02:30,174
DOING GREAT WITH COGNITIVE.

44
00:02:30,174 --> 00:02:33,107
I'M MORE COGNITIVE THAN EVER.

45
00:02:33,107 --> 00:02:38,980
THE DOCTOR SAID, SIR, YOU HAVE
TO BE IN THE TOP 99%

46
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:42,422
OF ALL THE
CON THE CUSHION AND DEMENTIA
PEOPLE WE GIVE THIS TEST TO.

47
00:02:42,422 --> 00:02:47,020
I SAID, WELL, I GUESS I'M VERY
GOOD AT RECOGNIZING ELEPHANTS.
WHO KNEW.

48
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:51,429
AND NOW WE'RE HERE.
AND THIS IS THE CAMPAIGN, FOLKS.

49
00:02:51,429 --> 00:02:56,387
THIS IS ALL THERE IS, ME YELLING
IN COURTHOUSE LOBBY

50
00:02:56,387 --> 00:03:02,234
STANDING
BEHIND BARRICADE LIKE AFAMILY
AT JFK PICKUP.

51
00:03:02,234 --> 00:03:06,942
BUT NEXT IS NEW HAMPSHIRE
AGAINST NIKKI HALEY.

52
00:03:06,943 --> 00:03:10,158
DARLING

53
00:03:10,158 --> 00:03:14,479
NIKKI, NIKKI, SHE THOUGHT I WAS DONE,

54
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:19,445
BUT I'M BACK IN A BIG WAY.
I'M BACK LIKE "MEAN GIRLS."

55
00:03:19,445 --> 00:03:22,464
YEAH, WE LOVE "MEAN GIRLS."

56
00:03:22,464 --> 00:03:25,069
WHERE'S LACY SH?

57
00:03:25,069 --> 00:03:29,101
WHERE'S LACY?
LET OUT OF REMAKE.
SO SAD.

58
00:03:29,101 --> 00:03:32,337
YOU KNOW HER FATHER DID TOASTER
STRUDLE. BUT

59
00:03:32,337 --> 00:03:37,396
SHE'S DOING GREAT THINGS IN
TERMS OF HALLMARK MOVIES,
STAYING BUSY.
JUST LIKE ME.

60
00:03:37,396 --> 00:03:39,868
JUST LIKE ME, IT'S IMPORTANT TO
HAVE HOBBIES.

61
00:03:39,868 --> 00:03:42,183
BIDEN HAS FALLING DOWN.

62
00:03:42,183 --> 00:03:46,850
I HAVE MY MINITRIALS.
I LOVE BEING ON TRIAL.

63
00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:50,042
BUT BIDEN'S VERY CREEPY.

64
00:03:50,042 --> 00:03:52,198
HE SNIFFS LITTLE GIRLS' HAIR.

65
00:03:52,287 --> 00:03:56,356
I AM DIFFERENT OF COURSE.
I DO FAR WORSE THAN THAT.

66
00:03:56,356 --> 00:03:59,451
YOU EVER SEE THAT VIDEO OF ME
DANCING WITH EPSTEIN?

67
00:03:59,451 --> 00:04:01,497
BOY IS THIS SOME DARK ENERGY.

68
00:04:01,497 --> 00:04:06,473
CLAPPING OFF BEAT.
I GOT THE EUGENE LEVY EYEBROWS.
VERY STRANGE.

69
00:04:06,473 --> 00:04:09,398
TWIN

70
00:04:09,474 --> 00:04:12,149
I WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED IF THE
THAT FOOTAGE WAS FAKE.

71
00:04:12,149 --> 00:04:13,418
OF COURSE IT'S VERY REAL.

72
00:04:13,418 --> 00:04:17,659
BUT YOU HAVE TO THINK IN MANY
WAYS IT COULD NOT BE.

73
00:04:17,659 --> 00:04:22,338
WE'VE SEEN A LOT OF SUCCESS WITH
SAYING THINGS THAT DID NOT
HAPPEN.

74
00:04:22,338 --> 00:04:23,989
I THINK WE'LL CONTINUE TO DO
THAT.

75
00:04:23,989 --> 00:04:28,284
IT'S AN INNOVATION I'M
PARTICULARLY PROUD OF.
SEEMS TO BE WORKING VERY WELL.

76
00:04:28,346 --> 00:04:32,583
BUT I LOVE THIS COUNTRY AND ITS
TRADITIONS.

77
00:04:32,583 --> 00:04:36,948
THAT'S WHY I'M NOT DOING ANY
DEBATES AND BARELY DOING
ELECTION.

78
00:04:36,948 --> 00:04:39,600
I DON'T NEED TO.
MY PEOPLE LOVE ME.

79
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:44,081
I GOT THE OLD PEOPLE.
THEY'RE WAITING IN SNOW FOR TWO
HOURS TO VOTE FOR TRUMP.

80
00:04:44,081 --> 00:04:47,871
OH, DARLING, I'M DYING.
I GOT TO DO ONE LAST THING.

81
00:04:47,871 --> 00:04:49,841
I GOT TO VOTE FOR TRUMP.

82
00:04:49,841 --> 00:04:52,970
WE JUST NEED THEM TO STAY ALIVE
UNTIL NOVEMBER.

83
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:57,975
STAY ALIVE UNTIL NOVEMBER.
JUST PULL THAT LEVER AND DROP
DEAD.

84
00:04:58,063 --> 00:05:02,277
WHY?
BECAUSE I AM SENT BY GOD,

85
00:05:02,277 --> 00:05:05,905
AND
GOD HAS A PLAN FOR ME OR
WHATEVER.
I DON'T KNOW.

86
00:05:05,905 --> 00:05:09,381
BUT 2024 IS GOING TO BE A VERY
EXCITING YEAR.

87
00:05:09,381 --> 00:05:12,631
I'M EITHER GOING TO JAIL, BE
PRESIDENT,

88
00:05:12,631 --> 00:05:15,881
OR FRANKLY, THE
PURGE.

89
00:05:15,881 --> 00:05:19,075
PERHAPS ALL THREE.
LET'S SPIN THE CHAMBER.

90
00:05:19,075 --> 00:05:22,642
AND LIVE FROM NEW YORK, IT'S
SATURDAY NIGHT!

91
00:07:28,695 --> 00:07:33,898
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, JACOB
ELORDI!

92
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:55,009
THANK

93
00:07:55,108 --> 00:07:58,101
IT IS SO EXCITING TO BE HERE
HOSTING THE FIRST

94
00:07:58,101 --> 00:08:01,869
AND SO FAR
BEST SHOW OF 2024.

95
00:08:03,405 --> 00:08:06,470
SO YOU MIGHT KNOW ME FROM
SALTBURN.

96
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:08,509
NOT FROM --

97
00:08:08,509 --> 00:08:09,913
THANKS.

98
00:08:09,913 --> 00:08:14,271
NOT FROM SEEING THE FILM, JUST
FROM SEEING THE TIKTOKS.

99
00:08:14,271 --> 00:08:16,717
LIKE THIS SCENE.

100
00:08:19,336 --> 00:08:22,811
YEAH.
I WAS THE ONE IN THE GRAVE.

101
00:08:22,811 --> 00:08:26,276
BUT IF YOU SAW THE MOVIE, THANK
YOU.

102
00:08:31,089 --> 00:08:34,433
IF YOU SAW THE MOVIE WITH YOUR
PARENTS, I'M SORRY.

103
00:08:34,433 --> 00:08:39,070
AND IF YOU SAY YOU THE MOVIE
WITH YOUR GIRLFRIEND, YOU'RE
WELCOME.

104
00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:41,618
ANYWAY, I'M NOT MUCH OF A PUBLIC SPEAKER,

105
00:08:41,618 --> 00:08:45,345
SO I THOUGHT I WOULD
OPEN IT UP TO SOME QUESTIONS
FROM THE AUDIENCE.

106
00:08:45,345 --> 00:08:47,203
YES, YOU?

107
00:08:47,203 --> 00:08:50,374
>> HI, BABY GIRL.

108
00:08:50,374 --> 00:08:52,502
LOVED YOU IN PRISCILLA.

109
00:08:52,502 --> 00:08:55,854
WHAT'S YOUR FAVORITE VERSION
OF ELVIS?

110
00:08:55,854 --> 00:08:58,502
YOUNG ELVIS OR OLD ELVIS?

111
00:08:58,502 --> 00:09:02,612
>> IT'S PROBABLY "LILO AND
STITCH" ELVIS, YEAH.

112
00:09:02,612 --> 00:09:04,688
ALL RIGHT.
NEXT QUESTION.
YOU?

113
00:09:04,688 --> 00:09:07,437
>> HI.
NO QUESTION.

114
00:09:07,437 --> 00:09:10,393
JUST WANT TO LOOK AT YOU.

115
00:09:11,991 --> 00:09:13,650
>> ARE YOU DONE?

116
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:16,830
>> NOT YET.
ALMOST.

117
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:19,605
>> OKAY.
>> DONE.

118
00:09:19,605 --> 00:09:23,096
>> WHO ELSE HAS A QUESTION?
YES, YOU.

119
00:09:23,096 --> 00:09:25,121
>> OKAY.

120
00:09:25,121 --> 00:09:27,153
NO, NO!

121
00:09:27,153 --> 00:09:31,419
MY GOD, I THOUGHT I WOULD GET
BETTER APPLAUSE THAN THAT.

122
00:09:31,419 --> 00:09:35,421
NO.

123
00:09:35,421 --> 00:09:38,741
ANYWAY, JUST WANTED TO SAY I SAW
YOUR MOVIE,

124
00:09:38,741 --> 00:09:42,285
AND I THOUGHT IT WAS
ABSOLUTELY GROSS.

125
00:09:42,285 --> 00:09:46,660
>> RIGHT.
YEAH.
WELL, "SALTBURN" REALLY ISN'T
FOR EVERYONE.

126
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:51,935
>> WHAT THE HELL IS A SALT BURN?
I'M TALKING ABOUT "THE KISSING
BOOTH."

127
00:09:54,388 --> 00:09:58,417
TWO PEOPLE KISSING ON THE MOUTH?
BLAH.

128
00:09:58,417 --> 00:10:02,555
>> KISSING IS KIND OF WEIRD WHEN
YOU THINK ABOUT IT.

129
00:10:02,555 --> 00:10:04,878
CAN YOU NAME ONE OTHER ANIMAL
THAT KISSES?

130
00:10:04,964 --> 00:10:07,394
>> EXCUSE ME, SIR.

131
00:10:09,702 --> 00:10:12,657
I BELIEVE I CAN NAME AN ANIMAL
THAT KISSES.

132
00:10:12,657 --> 00:10:15,231
>> YOU CAN?
>> YES.

133
00:10:15,231 --> 00:10:20,722
THE NOBLE ELEPHANT WILL
SOMETIMES PUT ITS TRUNK INTO ITS
LOVER'S MOUTH.

134
00:10:20,722 --> 00:10:22,691
>> HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?

135
00:10:22,691 --> 00:10:27,880
>> LET'S JUST SAY I OWN AN
ELEPHANT, AND I OPEN MY MOUTH A
LOT.

136
00:10:28,645 --> 00:10:31,579
>> OKAY.
I HAVE TIME FOR ONE MORE
QUESTION.

137
00:10:31,579 --> 00:10:32,541
YES, BOWEN?

138
00:10:32,541 --> 00:10:35,550
>> YOU KNOW HOW YOU WERE --

139
00:10:37,501 --> 00:10:39,851
MORE APPLAUSE THAN SARAH.

140
00:10:39,851 --> 00:10:44,030
YOU KNOW HOW YOU WERE BORN IN
AUSTRALIA?
I WAS ALSO BORN IN AUSTRALIA,

141
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:49,025
BUT WE MOVED WHEN I WAS A BABY,
SO MY ACCENT KIND OF GOES IN AND
OUT, MATE.

142
00:10:49,025 --> 00:10:52,401
>> COOL.
DID YOU HAVE A QUESTION?

143
00:10:52,401 --> 00:10:54,431
>> NO.

144
00:10:55,333 --> 00:10:57,190
>> GREAT JOB, BOWEN.

145
00:10:57,190 --> 00:11:00,161
BEFORE WE START, I JUST WANT TO
TAKE A MOMENT

146
00:11:00,161 --> 00:11:02,251
TO SAY HOW
GRATEFUL I AM TO BE HERE.

147
00:11:02,251 --> 00:11:04,363
I'VE BEEN ACTING NOW FOR LIKE
SEVEN YEARS,

148
00:11:04,363 --> 00:11:08,966
AND IT'S SO EASY TO
GET CAUGHT UP IN THE RUSH OF
TRYING TO GET TO THE NEXT THING
AND THE NEXT THING.

149
00:11:08,966 --> 00:11:12,605
BUT TONIGHT, THE PEOPLE I LOVE

CROWN YOUR SHORT KING.

158
00:11:54,953 --> 00:11:59,330
TIFFANY, YOU'VE SPENT THE PAST
THREE MONTHS GETTING TO KNOW THESE

159
00:11:59,330 --> 00:12:01,930
INCREDIBLE LITTLE GUYS.

160
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:05,592
BUT NOW YOU'RE DOWN TO YOUR LAST
THREE.

161
00:12:05,592 --> 00:12:09,931
KEVIN, HAROLD, TEDDY, PLEASE
STEP FORWARD.

162
00:12:09,931 --> 00:12:12,611
THE REST OF YOU MAY LEAVE.

163
00:12:12,611 --> 00:12:18,390
TIFFANY, TONIGHT, YOU'LL HAVE TO
PICK JUST ONE TO CROWN

164
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:21,344
AS YOUR
SHORT KING.

165
00:12:22,101 --> 00:12:25,572
THE FLOOR IS YOURS.

166
00:12:25,572 --> 00:12:27,705
>> GOD, THIS IS SO HARD.

167
00:12:27,705 --> 00:12:31,647
WHEN I CAME TO SHORT KING
MANSION, THE FIRST THING I
THOUGHT WAS,

168
00:12:31,647 --> 00:12:34,795
DAMN, I SHOULD HAVE
PACKED MORE FLATS.

169
00:12:34,795 --> 00:12:38,062
ON DATING APPS, I WAS THAT GIRL
WHO WOULD WRITE,

170
00:12:38,062 --> 00:12:40,919
IF YOU'RE UNDER
6 FEET, SWIPE LEFT.

171
00:12:40,919 --> 00:12:43,915
BUT GETTING TO KNOW ALL OF YOU
HAS MADE ME REALIZE

172
00:12:43,915 --> 00:12:47,365
THAT I WAS
LETTING GO OF SOME INCREDIBLE
GUYS.

173
00:12:47,365 --> 00:12:50,466
KEVIN, I FEEL SO CLOSE TO YOU,

174
00:12:50,466 --> 00:12:55,413
ESPECIALLY AFTER YOU OPENED UP
AND TOLD ME YOUR DOG HAS
ANXIETY.

175
00:12:56,637 --> 00:13:02,068
HAROLD, YOU'RE SERIOUSLY THE
FUNNIEST GUY ON PLANET EARTH.

176
00:13:03,735 --> 00:13:06,128
AND TINY TEDDY --

177
00:13:06,193 --> 00:13:08,268
>> IT'S JUST TEDDY.

178
00:13:08,268 --> 00:13:12,577
>> RIGHT.
TEDDY, LAST NIGHT WE CONNECTED
IN THE OVERNIGHT SUITE

179
00:13:12,577 --> 00:13:15,096
PHYSICALLY AND SPIRITUALLY.

180
00:13:15,096 --> 00:13:18,610
YOU'VE ALL PROVEN TO ME

181
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:22,276
THAT SOMETIMES THE BEST THINGS COME
IN THE SMALLEST PACKAGES.

182
00:13:22,276 --> 00:13:27,764
AND SOMETIMES SMALL PACKAGES
HAVE MEDIUM-SIZED PACKAGES.

183
00:13:31,536 --> 00:13:33,354
BUT NOW I HAVE TO CHOOSE.

184
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:34,578
>> TIFFANY, WAIT.

185
00:13:34,578 --> 00:13:38,374
BEFORE YOU DO, WE HAVE ONE FINAL
TWIST.

186
00:13:38,374 --> 00:13:39,530
>> WHAT?

187
00:13:39,530 --> 00:13:43,532
>> I HAVE ONE MORE BACHELOR TO
INTRODUCE INTO THE GAME.

189
00:13:49,804 --> 00:13:52,923
>> WHAT'S UP?

190
00:13:52,923 --> 00:13:55,549
>> YEAH, I CHOOSE HIM.

191
00:13:55,549 --> 00:13:57,769
>> NOPE.
NOT SUPPOSED TO YET.

192
00:13:57,769 --> 00:14:00,533
YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING --
>> YEAH, IT WON'T MATTER.

193
00:14:00,533 --> 00:14:03,434
>> WELL, LET'S GET TO KNOW HIM
ANYWAY.

194
00:14:03,434 --> 00:14:07,155
JACKSON, TELL TIFFANY A LITTLE
ABOUT YOURSELF.

195
00:14:07,155 --> 00:14:12,004
>> THREE THINGS ABOUT ME IS THAT
I'M FROM PITTSBURGH,

196
00:14:12,004 --> 00:14:14,235
I TECHNICALLY STILL HAVE A
GIRLFRIEND,

197
00:14:14,235 --> 00:14:17,603
AND I NEED TO BORROW
$200,000.

198
00:14:17,603 --> 00:14:20,673
>> SO DO I JUST GIVE HIM THE
CROWN NOW OR --

199
00:14:20,673 --> 00:14:23,240
>> TIFFANY, BEFORE YOU DECIDE,
REMEMBER,

200
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:27,313
YOU SPENT THREE MONTHS
WITH OUR LIL BACHELORS.

201
00:14:27,313 --> 00:14:30,110
>> JUST BACHELORS IS FINE.

202
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:32,655
>> I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT TINY
TEDDY.

203
00:14:32,655 --> 00:14:34,230
>> JUST TEDDY.

204
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:37,900
AND ACTUALLY WHEN I CAME HERE, I
SAID MY NAME WAS THEODORE.

205
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:43,439
>> OH, RIGHT.
AND I SAID, LIKE THAT CHIPMUNK.
>> YEAH.

206
00:14:43,794 --> 00:14:47,729
>> LOOK, I LOVED MY TIME WITH
YOU GUYS.

207
00:14:47,729 --> 00:14:52,970
BUT WITH JACKSON, I WON'T HAVE
TO LIKE WEIRDLY BEND MY KNEES IN
PHOTOS.

208
00:14:52,970 --> 00:14:56,012
>> NOW YOU'RE JUST BEING RUDE.
>> DON'T GET MAD.

209
00:14:56,012 --> 00:15:00,986
I HATE IT WHEN THEY GET MAD,
THEY LIKE BALL THEIR LITTLE
FISTS.

210
00:15:00,986 --> 00:15:04,765
>> OH, WHOA.

211
00:15:04,765 --> 00:15:07,657
>> THAT'S AWESOME, JACKSON.

212
00:15:08,177 --> 00:15:11,610
>> ALL RIGHT.
WELL, BEFORE YOU MAKE YOUR FINAL
DECISION,

213
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:14,249
WE DID ASK ALL YOUR
REMAINING SUITORS

479
00:25:43,683 --> 00:25:45,016
BE THAT FAR APART?

480
00:25:45,018 --> 00:25:47,351

486
00:25:56,729 --> 00:25:59,263

502
00:26:34,734 --> 00:26:36,701
WANT TO FIND YOU ONE DAY WITH A

503

507
00:26:46,179 --> 00:26:47,445
>> I KNOW.

508
00:26:47,447 --> 00:26:49,814
A NEEDLE IN HER ARM?

509
00:26:49,816 --> 00:26:51,315
PRETTY GIRL LIKE THAT WOULD

510
00:26:51,317 --> 00:26:51,916
SHOOT BETWEEN HER TOES.

511
00:26:51,918 --> 00:26:53,084

IMPACTED TESTICLE, IT'S VERY

548

COULD FIX THIS TIRE.

575
00:29:10,590 --> 00:29:11,522

AFTER
A CABIN DOOR BROKE OFF.

THEY BOTH WON

727

THEM.

728

PASS AWAY, IT'S WORTH IT.

NOT A GOOD SIGN THAT PRESIDENT

748

WERE SO RACIST, WHY DID THEY
HAVE SEX WITH THEIR SLAVES?

RIVAL?

00:41:01,853 --> 00:41:03,219
>> NIKKI AND I WILL ALWAYS BE

CLOSE FRIENDS, BUT NICKY, OR AS

798
00:41:06,191 --> 00:41:09,425
MR. TRUMP TOLD ME TO CALL HER --

799
00:41:10,095 --> 00:41:10,460
LANGUAGE ]

800
00:41:10,462 --> 00:41:11,728
-- SHE MAY NOT EVEN BE FROM

801
00:41:11,730 --> 00:41:12,795
SOUTH CAROLINA OR EVEN AMERICA.

802
00:41:12,797 --> 00:41:15,565
>> SENATOR, YOU KNOW THAT'S NOT

803
00:41:15,567 --> 00:41:15,865
TRUE.

804
00:41:15,867 --> 00:41:19,068
THOSE ARE JUST RACIST DOG

805
00:41:19,070 --> 00:41:19,435
WHISTLES.

806
00:41:19,437 --> 00:41:22,171
>> MICHAEL, THAT'S NOT A RACIST

807
00:41:22,173 --> 00:41:22,572
DOG WHISTLE.

808
00:41:22,574 --> 00:41:24,307
THIS IS.

809
00:41:24,309 --> 00:41:26,509
>> WHAT IS THAT NOISE?

810
00:41:36,087 --> 00:41:38,087
>> WHAT DO YOU SAY TO PEOPLE WHO

811
00:41:38,089 --> 00:41:39,689
THINK TRUMP IS ONLY USING YOU TO

812
00:41:39,691 --> 00:41:41,157
WIN THE BLACK VOTES?

813
00:41:41,159 --> 00:41:43,159
>> LOOK, THAT IS IMPOSSIBLE

814
00:41:43,161 --> 00:41:43,927
BECAUSE BLACK PEOPLE DO NOT LIKE

815
00:41:43,929 --> 00:41:44,193
ME.

816
00:41:44,195 --> 00:41:46,796
ALL RIGHT?

817
00:41:46,798 --> 00:41:49,465
ONE TIME I SAID THE N WORD AT A

818
00:41:49,467 --> 00:41:50,733
BARBERSHOP, AND EVERYONE WENT,

819
00:41:50,735 --> 00:41:52,468
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

820
00:41:52,470 --> 00:41:54,637
SO WHEN MR. TRUMP ASKED ME TO

821
00:41:54,639 --> 00:41:57,373
CAMPAIGN FOR HIM IN INTERCITIES

822
00:41:57,375 --> 00:41:59,943
LIKE DETROIT AND PHILADELPHIA, I

823
00:41:59,945 --> 00:42:01,978
SAID WHY DON'T WE START IN NEW

824
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:02,378
HAMPSHIRE?

825
00:42:02,380 --> 00:42:03,513
THOSE ARE MY PEOPLE.

826
00:42:03,515 --> 00:42:05,048
>> NOW THERE'S SPECULATION ABOUT

827
00:42:05,050 --> 00:42:08,451
YOUR POLITICAL FUTURE.

828
00:42:08,453 --> 00:42:09,152
IF TRUMP PICKS YOU TO BE HIS

829
00:42:09,154 --> 00:42:09,986
RUNNING MATE, WOULD YOU DO IT?

830
00:42:09,988 --> 00:42:10,920
>> ABSOLUTELY.

831
00:42:10,922 --> 00:42:15,792
I WOULD BE HONORED.

832
00:42:15,794 --> 00:42:17,660
>> REALLY?

833
00:42:17,662 --> 00:42:18,494
EVEN THOUGH HE HO TOLD A MOB TO

834
00:42:18,496 --> 00:42:19,596
HANG HIS LAST ONE?

835
00:42:19,598 --> 00:42:22,565
>> HE DID WHAT?

836
00:42:22,567 --> 00:42:23,733

837
00:42:25,937 --> 00:42:29,365
>> A NEW REPORT FINDS THE
AVERAGE 50-YEAR-OLD IN AMERICA

838
00:42:29,365 --> 00:42:31,581

839
00:42:31,581 --> 00:42:36,297
WHILE
THE AVERAGE 30-YEAR-OLD IS WORTH
MORE DEAD THAN ALIVE.

840
00:42:36,799 --> 00:42:40,642
>> ELTON JOHN WON AN EMMY FOR
HIS FAIR WELL CONCERT SPECIAL

841
00:42:40,642 --> 00:42:42,701
EARNING HIM A COVETED E.G.O.T.,

842
00:42:42,701 --> 00:42:47,044
WHICH IS AN EMMY, A GRAMMY, AN
OSCAR, AND A TONY.

843
00:42:49,644 --> 00:42:54,488
A NEW STARTUP COMPANY IS
DEVELOPING A MALE CONTRACEPTIVE

844
00:42:54,488 --> 00:42:58,510
THAT INVOLVES ONE INJECTION THAT
WILL PREVENT PREGNANCY FOR TEN YEARS,

845
00:42:58,510 --> 00:43:00,789
SO GET READY FOR AN
EXCITING FUTURE

846
00:43:00,789 --> 00:43:03,809
OF TAKING THE
MAN'S WORD FOR IT.

847
00:43:04,692 --> 00:43:08,495
HE LIKED THAT.
GOOD JOKE.

848

>> A VOLVO CRASHED THROUGH THE
FRONT OF A WHOLE FOODS IN A
MARYLAND SUBURB.

IT WAS AN ACCIDENT TO WHITE THAT
EVERYONE'S INSURANCE WENT DOWN.

A PASSENGER ON SPIRIT AIRLINES
WAS ARRESTED

851
00:43:25,131 --> 00:43:29,668
AFTER HE REPEATEDLY
ASKED FEMALE FLIGHT ATTENDANTS
TO JOIN THE MILE HIGH CLUB,

852
00:43:29,668 --> 00:43:34,302

THEY COULDN'T GET
THEIR CARS TO CHARGE.

855
00:43:42,789 --> 00:43:47,922
ON THE PLUS SIDE, THEY WERE ABLE
TO STAY WARM IN THE BATTERY
FIRES.

856
00:43:49,413 --> 00:43:54,747
A MAN ON A PLANE IN INDIA WHO

SLIPPED HIM A PIECE OF PAPER
READING DO NOT PANIC.

858
00:43:58,273 --> 00:44:03,321
THEN HE SLIPPED THEM A PIECE OF
PAPER BACK READING MORE PAPER
PLEASE.

859
00:44:06,767 --> 00:44:11,457
>> A NEW STUDY SUGGESTS THAT MEN
ARE BETTER THAN WOMEN AT USING A MAP,

860
00:44:11,457 --> 00:44:15,155
WHILE WOMEN ARE BETTER AT
SILENTLY SITTING FOR THE REST OF THE CAR RIDE

861
00:44:15,155 --> 00:44:17,397
AFTER YOU TELL THEM
THAT.

VERY CAREFUL SHOVING THE VAPE UP
THERE.

>> THAT'S THE STUDY.
>> THAT'S THE STUDY.
THAT'S A REAL STUDY.

866
00:44:37,259 --> 00:44:39,256
THIS WAS A NICE STORY OVER THE
HOLIDAYS,

867
00:44:39,256 --> 00:44:42,217
NEARLY 20 DRIVERS ON
THE STATEN ISLAND EXPRESSWAY

868

WORKED TOGETHER TO SAVE A
CHIHUAHUA NAMED BEAN THAT RAN ON TO THE ROAD,

869
00:44:46,597 --> 00:44:52,459
AND THEY BANDED
TOGETHER AGAIN TO SEND BEAN BACK
WHERE HE CAME FROM.

870

IN THE HER OWN DAMN COURTROOM.

887

LAW, MAN?

EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM

SHERIFFS NEED TO BE FIRED.

895

PLAY THE CLIP AGAIN.

YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEAN.

904
00:46:05,785 --> 00:46:07,685
HOME BOY WAS THINKING ABOUT A

905
00:46:07,687 --> 00:46:07,985
SNACK.

906
00:46:07,987 --> 00:46:08,986

FIVE, SIX GOOD SECONDS.

917

THAT WAS CRAZY.

920

BEEN ATTACKED IN THEIR OWN

922
00:46:34,581 --> 00:46:35,079

00:46:39,085 --> 00:46:40,418
WHY THIS JUDGE WASN'T BEHIND

927
00:46:40,420 --> 00:46:41,552
SOME GLASS, MAN.

928
00:46:41,554 --> 00:46:44,388
HOW IS THIS MY FAULT?

929
00:46:44,390 --> 00:46:45,823
I WAS BLUFFING.

930
00:46:45,825 --> 00:46:47,558
I THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO BOUNCE

931
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:48,993
OFF SOME GLASS.

932
00:46:48,995 --> 00:46:50,928

933
00:46:50,930 --> 00:46:51,963
>> EVERYBODY GOT GLASS.

934
00:46:51,965 --> 00:46:56,200

00:46:57,637 --> 00:47:00,071

MAN, THERE FOR SURE GOING TO BE

938
00:47:03,943 --> 00:47:05,576

YOU FEEL ME?

940
00:47:06,646 --> 00:47:09,146

>> OF COURSE I DO.

942

00:47:14,354 --> 00:47:16,721
BIT, AND WHEN I GOT CONTACT, I

949
00:47:25,565 --> 00:47:27,498
>> PROBABLY FOR EVERYBODY'S

950
00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:27,832
SAFETY.

951
00:47:27,834 --> 00:47:29,166

SAYING YOU WERE HAVING A MENTAL

956
00:47:37,110 --> 00:47:37,475
BREAKDOWN.

957
00:47:37,477 --> 00:47:38,509
WAS THAT TRUE?

958
00:47:38,511 --> 00:47:39,510
>> I BELIEVE THAT MAY HAVE BEEN

959
00:47:39,512 --> 00:47:40,811
THE CASE, YES.

960
00:47:40,813 --> 00:47:49,620
MENTALLY, IT WAS A BREAKDOWN.

961
00:47:49,622 --> 00:47:51,722
BUT ATHLETICALLY, IT WAS GREAT,

962
00:47:51,724 --> 00:47:51,989
MAN.

963
00:47:51,991 --> 00:47:54,058
BUT I TELL YOU WHAT, NOW WHEN I

964
00:47:54,060 --> 00:47:57,595
GO TO THE COURT FOR THAT APPEAL,

965
00:47:57,597 --> 00:47:58,562
I BET Y'ALL THEY GOING TO HAVE

966
00:47:58,564 --> 00:47:59,096
SOME GLASS.

967
00:47:59,098 --> 00:48:01,265
>> THAT'S ENOUGH.

968
00:48:01,267 --> 00:48:02,433
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

969
00:48:25,641 --> 00:48:31,679
ONE POINT, THE PRIEST WHO

970
00:48:31,681 --> 00:48:33,514
MARRIED US SAID TO ME PRIVATELY,

971
00:48:33,516 --> 00:48:36,050
I'M PRAYING THAT Y'ALL DIVORCE.

972
00:48:36,052 --> 00:48:38,019
BUT NOW I'M SOBER.

973
00:48:38,021 --> 00:48:39,387
AA SAVED OUR MARRIAGE.

974
00:48:39,389 --> 00:48:43,424
THANKS FOR LETTING ME SHARE.

975
00:48:43,426 --> 00:48:44,625
>> HI.

976
00:48:44,627 --> 00:48:44,925
SORRY.

977
00:48:44,927 --> 00:48:46,827
IS THIS AN AA MEETING?

978
00:48:46,829 --> 00:48:48,896
>> THIS IS A WOMEN'S MEETING,

979
00:48:48,898 --> 00:48:49,163
GUY.

980
00:48:49,165 --> 00:48:50,631
>> OH, MY BAD.

981
00:48:50,633 --> 00:48:52,199
THE DIRECTORY SAID THERE'S A

982
00:48:52,201 --> 00:48:53,467
MEETING IN ST. JOHN'S.

983
00:48:53,469 --> 00:48:55,302
>> DUDE, LOOK AT THE SIGN.

984
00:48:55,304 --> 00:48:57,738
WOMEN SUPPORTING WOMEN.

985
00:48:57,740 --> 00:48:58,305
>> OKAY.

986
00:48:58,307 --> 00:48:59,774
NO WORRIES.

987
00:48:59,776 --> 00:49:00,441
WELL, I'LL TELL THE JUDGE I

988
00:49:00,443 --> 00:49:08,416
TRIED.

989
00:49:08,418 --> 00:49:09,850
>> CAN YOU BELIEVE HIM?

990
00:49:10,286 --> 00:49:11,018
I'M JUST REALLY GRATEFUL TO HAVE

991
00:49:11,020 --> 00:49:11,719
A GROUP OF WOMEN TO CONNECT

992
00:49:11,721 --> 00:49:12,019
WITH.

993
00:49:12,021 --> 00:49:12,420
>> I AGREE.

994
00:49:12,422 --> 00:49:13,187
I HATED AA UNTIL I FOUND GIRLS.

995
00:49:13,189 --> 00:49:15,189
>> MM.

996
00:49:15,191 --> 00:49:17,591
>> SORRY TO INTERRUPT.

997
00:49:17,593 --> 00:49:20,494
IS THIS AN AA MEETING?

998
00:49:20,496 --> 00:49:20,861
>> IT IS.

999
00:49:20,863 --> 00:49:24,298
MOVE.

1000
00:49:24,300 --> 00:49:25,766
SIT HERE.

1001
00:49:25,768 --> 00:49:26,133
SIT HERE.

1002
00:49:26,135 --> 00:49:26,500
>> UH-HUH.

1003
00:49:26,502 --> 00:49:29,136
YEAH.

1004
00:49:29,138 --> 00:49:31,205
>> DO YOU WANT TO INTRODUCE

1005
00:49:31,207 --> 00:49:33,174
YOURSELF TO THE GROUP?

1006
00:49:33,176 --> 00:49:34,508
>> SURE.

1007
00:49:34,510 --> 00:49:35,276
I GUESS.

1008
00:49:35,278 --> 00:49:36,043
MY NAME IS JOSHUA, AND I'M AN

1009
00:49:36,045 --> 00:49:38,045
ALCOHOLIC.

1010
00:49:38,047 --> 00:49:41,449
>> HI, JOSHUA.

1011
00:49:41,451 --> 00:49:42,550
>> AND I'M SOBER FOR 78 DAYS

1012
00:49:42,552 --> 00:49:44,585
NOW.

1013
00:49:44,587 --> 00:49:47,488
>> GET IT.

1014
00:49:47,490 --> 00:49:47,955
>> THANK YOU.

1015
00:49:47,957 --> 00:49:48,355
THANK YOU.

1016
00:49:48,357 --> 00:49:49,390
I APPRECIATE IT.

1017
00:49:49,392 --> 00:49:51,826
YOU KNOW I'M GRATEFUL TO BE

1018
00:49:51,828 --> 00:49:52,126
SOBER.

1019
00:49:52,128 --> 00:49:54,328
IT'S JUST, WHEN I'M SOBER OFF

1020
00:49:54,330 --> 00:49:56,797
DRUGS AND ALCOHOL, I ACT OUT

1021
00:49:56,799 --> 00:49:58,099
SEXUALLY WITH WOMEN.

1022
00:49:58,101 --> 00:49:58,666
>> MM.

1023
00:49:58,668 --> 00:50:00,301
>> OH, NO.

1024
00:50:00,303 --> 00:50:01,469
>> THAT IS TOUGH STUFF.

1025
00:50:01,471 --> 00:50:02,837
>> YOU GOT THIS, THOUGH.

1026
00:50:02,839 --> 00:50:04,071
>> ONE DAY AT A TIME.

1027
00:50:04,073 --> 00:50:07,942
>> BUT, YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW

1028
00:50:07,944 --> 00:50:10,444
IF I'M REPLACING ONE DRUG WITH

1029
00:50:10,446 --> 00:50:12,780
ANOTHER, AND I DON'T WANT TO BE

1030
00:50:12,782 --> 00:50:13,247
TOO GRAPHIC.

1031
00:50:13,249 --> 00:50:14,048
>> PLEASE DO.

1032
00:50:14,050 --> 00:50:15,883
BECAUSE I KNOW IT COULD HELP

1033
00:50:15,885 --> 00:50:16,217
SOMEONE.

1034
00:50:16,219 --> 00:50:18,252
FOR ME, HEARING A GRAPHIC STORY

1035
00:50:18,254 --> 00:50:21,055
KEEPS ME OFF THE BOTTLE.

1036
00:50:21,057 --> 00:50:21,722
>> MM HMM.

1037
00:50:21,724 --> 00:50:23,924
>> I ABSOLUTELY RUN THROUGH

1038
00:50:23,926 --> 00:50:24,225
WOMEN.

1039
00:50:24,227 --> 00:50:26,160
MY APPETITE IS INSATIABLE.

1040
00:50:26,162 --> 00:50:27,962
>> THAT IS SO SAD.

1041
00:50:27,964 --> 00:50:30,197
AND IS THERE AN AGE CUTOFF OR A

1042
00:50:30,199 --> 00:50:31,766
BODY TYPE YOU GO FOR?

1043
00:50:31,768 --> 00:50:34,201
>> NO, IT'S ANY AND ALL TYPES.

1044
00:50:34,203 --> 00:50:36,103
ALL OF THEM.

1045
00:50:36,105 --> 00:50:37,104
>> MM.

1046
00:50:37,106 --> 00:50:38,272
>> MM.

1047
00:50:38,274 --> 00:50:41,308
>> I HOPE I'M NOT TRIGGERING

1048
00:50:41,310 --> 00:50:41,642
ANYONE.

1049
00:50:41,644 --> 00:50:43,410
IN FACT, NOW THAT I'M LOOKING

1050
00:50:43,412 --> 00:50:45,679
AROUND, I FEEL LIKE I ONLY SEE

1051
00:50:45,681 --> 00:50:46,013
WOMEN.

1052
00:50:46,015 --> 00:50:47,681
>> WELL, USUALLY THERE'S MEN

1053
00:50:47,683 --> 00:50:49,049
HERE, BUT THEY'RE ALL AT THE

1054
00:50:49,051 --> 00:50:49,350
GAME.

1055
00:50:49,352 --> 00:50:49,984
>> WHAT GAME?

1056
00:50:49,986 --> 00:50:52,787
>> I DON'T KNOW.

1057
00:50:52,789 --> 00:50:53,220
COMICON.

1058
00:50:53,222 --> 00:50:55,623
BACK TO YOUR SOBRIETY.

1059
00:50:55,625 --> 00:50:56,624
YOU WERE SAYING SOMETHING ABOUT

1060
00:50:56,626 --> 00:50:59,160
BEING ATTRACTED TO ALL

1061
00:50:59,162 --> 00:50:59,593
ETHNICITIES.

1062
00:50:59,595 --> 00:50:59,960
>> YEAH.

1063
00:50:59,962 --> 00:51:01,929
THE LONGER I STAY SOBER, THE

1064
00:51:01,931 --> 00:51:05,099
MORE I ABSOLUTELY COMPULSIVELY

1065
00:51:05,101 --> 00:51:07,334
ACT OUT WITH WOMEN.

1066
00:51:07,336 --> 00:51:07,902
>> MM!

1067
00:51:07,904 --> 00:51:10,271
>> HEY, HEY, YOU HAVE TO DO WHAT

1068
00:51:10,273 --> 00:51:14,441
YOU HAVE TO DO FOR YOUR

1069
00:51:14,443 --> 00:51:15,009
SOBRIETY.

1070
00:51:15,011 --> 00:51:17,511
DON'T BEAT YOURSELF OFF -- UP.

1071
00:51:17,513 --> 00:51:19,647
>> I GUESS YOU'RE RIGHT.

1072
00:51:19,649 --> 00:51:21,348
BESIDES, IT'S NOTHING COMPARED

1073
00:51:21,350 --> 00:51:24,018
TO MY BEHAVIOR WHEN I WAS

1074
00:51:24,020 --> 00:51:24,618
DRINKING.

1075
00:51:24,620 --> 00:51:26,554
I WOULD ABSOLUTELY WEAR THOSE

1076
00:51:26,556 --> 00:51:28,689
POOR WOMEN LIKE A GAS MASK.

1077
00:51:28,691 --> 00:51:29,390
>> YOU KNOW, YOU COULD DRINK

1078
00:51:29,392 --> 00:51:31,992
AGAIN.

1079
00:51:31,994 --> 00:51:33,761
>> ARE YOU SURE THIS ISN'T A

1080
00:51:33,763 --> 00:51:34,295
WOMEN'S MEETING?

1081
00:51:34,297 --> 00:51:37,298
I MEAN, THAT SIGN SAYS WOMEN

1082
00:51:37,300 --> 00:51:38,566
SUPPORTING WOMEN.

1083
00:51:38,568 --> 00:51:40,401
>> IT'S PRINTED WRONG.

1084
00:51:40,403 --> 00:51:41,769
IT SHOULD SAY WOMEN SUPPORTING

1085
00:51:41,771 --> 00:51:44,205
WOMEN SUPPORTING YOU.

1086
00:51:44,207 --> 00:51:45,272
>> SORRY.

1087
00:51:45,274 --> 00:51:47,374
YOU WERE SAYING SOMETHING ABOUT

1088
00:51:47,376 --> 00:51:48,075
GIVING WOMEN THE DICKING OF A

1089
00:51:48,077 --> 00:51:50,177
LIFETIME?

1090
00:51:50,179 --> 00:51:51,212
>> OH, RIGHT.

1091
00:51:51,214 --> 00:51:53,280
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

1092
00:51:53,282 --> 00:51:55,683
I WAS NEVER A BETTER LOVER THAN

1093
00:51:55,685 --> 00:51:56,951
WHEN I WAS DRUNK.

1094
00:51:56,953 --> 00:51:58,853
I WAS PASSIONATE AND WILD, AND

1095
00:51:58,855 --> 00:52:01,388
IT WENT ALL NIGHT.

1096
00:52:01,390 --> 00:52:02,790
>> MM, MM, MM.

1097
00:52:02,792 --> 00:52:05,693
>> ALL IT TOOK WAS A COUPLE OF

1098
00:52:05,695 --> 00:52:06,026
BEERS.

1099
00:52:06,028 --> 00:52:06,861
>> OKAY.

1100
00:52:06,863 --> 00:52:08,362
THIS IS WEIRD, BUT THERE ARE

1101
00:52:08,364 --> 00:52:10,631
RANDOMLY TWO BEERS HERE.

1102
00:52:10,633 --> 00:52:13,267
>> I'M GOING TO BE SUPER

1103
00:52:13,269 --> 00:52:14,335
VULNERABLE WITH Y'ALL.

1104
00:52:14,337 --> 00:52:22,977
I'M FEELING THE URGE TO ACT OUT.

1105
00:52:22,979 --> 00:52:25,713
>> OH, THAT -- THAT IS TOTALLY

1106
00:52:25,715 --> 00:52:28,015
NORMAL.

1107
00:52:28,017 --> 00:52:33,087
I MEAN, HOW DO WE SUPPORT -- HOW

1108
00:52:33,089 --> 00:52:33,787
DO WE BEST SUPPORT YOU RIGHT

1109
00:52:33,789 --> 00:52:37,057
NOW?

1110
00:52:37,059 --> 00:52:39,860
>> OH, YOUR TOP HAS FALLEN

1111
00:52:39,862 --> 00:52:40,294
SLIGHTLY OPEN.

1112

1113
00:52:42,732 --> 00:52:44,398
I'M JUST OVERHEATED.

1114
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:45,532
I MEAN, MAYBE I'LL COOL DOWN IF

1115

00:57:58,637 --> 00:58:01,906
TO SOMETHING THAT
DOESN'T SOUND LIKE NATALIE
PORTMAN.

1289
00:58:01,906 --> 00:58:04,233
OH, HE'S HERE.

1290
00:58:04,233 --> 00:58:06,175
I HAVE A SPECIAL SURPRISE FOR
ALL OF YOU.

1291
00:58:06,175 --> 00:58:09,268
SINCE YOU ALL ASPIRE TO BE
WORKING ACTORS, WHO BETTER TO
GIVE ADVICE

1292
00:58:09,268 --> 00:58:15,411
THAN A VERY FAMOUS
ACTOR, MR. TREVOR!

1293
00:58:19,496 --> 00:58:21,728
>> THANKS SO MUCH FOR HAVING ME.

1294
00:58:21,728 --> 00:58:27,123
>> I'M VERY EXCITED FOR YOU TO
HEAR FIRSTHAND HOW HARD ACTORS
MUST WORK TO ACHIEVE SUCCESS.

1295
00:58:27,123 --> 00:58:29,226
I'M SURE YOU ALL HAVE QUESTIONS.
ASK AWAY.

1296
00:58:29,291 --> 00:58:32,865
>> SO, YEAH, YOU'RE AWESOME.

1297
00:58:32,865 --> 00:58:36,400
>> OH, THANKS, MAN.
THAT MEANS THE WORLD.
THANK YOU.

1298
00:58:37,037 --> 00:58:40,867
>> SO I'M LIKE THREE YEARS INTO
THE AUDITIONING GRIND,

1299
00:58:40,938 --> 00:58:43,406
AND THE
NEEDLE HAS NOT MOVED FOR ME AT
ALL.

1300
00:58:43,406 --> 00:58:47,723
I'M CURIOUS HOW LONG DID IT TAKE
FOR YOU TO GET YOUR FIRST, LIKE,
BIG BREAK?

1301
00:58:47,723 --> 00:58:51,960
>> WELL, I FLEW TO LA

1302
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:55,199
TO GIVE
THE WHOLE HOLLYWOOD THING A SHOT,

1303
00:58:55,199 --> 00:58:58,667
AND AS I WALKED OFF THE
PLANE, SELENA GOMEZ CAME UP TO ME,

1304
00:58:58,667 --> 00:59:03,275
SAID I WAS GORGEOUS, AND
ASKED ME TO PLAY HER BOYFRIEND
IN A MUSIC VIDEO,

1305
00:59:03,275 --> 00:59:06,944
AND THAT LED
TO THE MOVIES AND EVERYTHING.

1306
00:59:06,944 --> 00:59:12,318
>> OKAY.
SO THE MOMENT YOU STEPPED IN LA,
YOU GOT YOUR BIG BREAK?
COOL.

1307
00:59:12,318 --> 00:59:15,081
>> YEAH.
AND IT WAS ALL THANKS TO SELENA
GOMEZ.

1308
00:59:15,081 --> 00:59:17,343
ABSOLUTE SWEETHEART BY THE WAY.

1309
00:59:17,343 --> 00:59:20,708
>> OH, YEA.
I'M SO GLAD.
I LOVE HER.

1310
00:59:20,708 --> 00:59:25,852
>> HI.
SO I'VE BEEN AUDITIONING FOR
LIKE FIVE YEARS,

1311
00:59:25,852 --> 00:59:27,060
AND I'VE GOT
NOTHING.

1312
00:59:27,060 --> 00:59:30,996
MY AGENT ACTUALLY TOLD ME IT'S
TIME TO CONSIDER PORN.

1313
00:59:30,996 --> 00:59:35,325
SO HOW DO YOU HANDLE REJECTION?

1314
00:59:36,744 --> 00:59:38,874
>> I FEEL SO DUMB RIGHT NOW.

1315
00:59:38,874 --> 00:59:41,766
I AM NOT FAMILIAR WITH THAT
WORD.

1316
00:59:41,766 --> 00:59:45,346
I'M NOT ON SOCIAL MEDIA.
IS IT LIKE A SLANG?

1317
00:59:45,346 --> 00:59:48,672
>> OH, NO.
REJECTION IS LIKE, I DON'T KNOW,

1318
00:59:48,672 --> 00:59:51,092
LIKE A PART OF THE HUMAN
CONDITION.

1319
00:59:51,092 --> 00:59:54,849
>> YEAH.
IT'S LIKE WHEN SOMEONE DOESN'T
WANT YOU FOR SOMETHING.

1320
00:59:54,849 --> 00:59:59,858
>> OH, NO.
NO.
THAT'S SO SAD.

1321
00:59:59,917 --> 01:00:03,913
YEAH.
REALLY, I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT THAT.

1322
01:00:03,913 --> 01:00:09,062
>> HI.
I'M SUCH A HUGE FAN OF YOURS.

1323
01:00:09,062 --> 01:00:12,235
>> ARE YOU KIDDING?
I'M A FAN OF YOURS.

1324
01:00:12,235 --> 01:00:15,507
SPOTLIGHT, THAT'S AMAZING.

1325
01:00:17,038 --> 01:00:20,103
>> NO.
I'M NOT RACHEL McADAMS.

1326
01:00:20,103 --> 01:00:22,657
I'M NATALIE PARTMAN.

1327
01:00:22,657 --> 01:00:27,168
SO ANYWAY, TO MAKE MONEY, I
STARTED AN ONLYFANS,

1328
01:00:27,168 --> 01:00:29,861
AND I WAS
SUED BY RACHEL McADAMS,

1329
01:00:29,861 --> 01:00:33,649
WHO
ACCUSED ME OF BEING A DEEP FAKE HER,

1330
01:00:33,649 --> 01:00:39,242
SO, ANYWAY, WHAT ADVICE DO
YOU HAVE FOR SOMEONE WHO LOOKS
LIKE A FAMOUS PERSON?

1331
01:00:39,242 --> 01:00:43,372
>> I MEAN, ARE YOU A BETTER
ACTRESS THAN RACHEL McADAMS?

1332
01:00:43,372 --> 01:00:46,001
>> I'LL ANSWER THAT.
NO.

1333
01:00:46,001 --> 01:00:49,857
>> OKAY.
THEN I WOULD SAY GIVE UP AND
STOP PURSUING A FILM CAREER.

1334
01:00:49,953 --> 01:00:52,745
>> GOT IT.
SO I'LL FOCUS ON TV.

1335
01:00:52,860 --> 01:00:55,425
NAMASTE.

1336
01:00:56,245 --> 01:00:59,576
>> OKAY.
HI, TREVIS.

1337
01:00:59,576 --> 01:01:03,390
I'M FAN BOYING OUT RIGHT NOW.
DON'T BE WEIRD.

1338
01:01:03,390 --> 01:01:07,930
DO YOU HAVE ANY, LIKE, AUDITION
HACKS?

1339
01:01:07,930 --> 01:01:12,320
>> I'M SORRY.
I KEEP HEARING THIS WORD,
AUDITION.

1340
01:01:12,320 --> 01:01:14,346
SORRY.
WHAT IS THAT?

1341
01:01:14,346 --> 01:01:16,937
>> IT'S WHERE YOU TRY OUT FOR A
PART.

1342
01:01:16,937 --> 01:01:20,701
>> OH, MY GOD.
THEY MAKE YOU DO THAT?

1343
01:01:20,701 --> 01:01:22,881
DUDE, I DON'T THINK THAT'S
ALLOWED.

1344
01:01:22,881 --> 01:01:26,022
I MEAN, YOU KNOW, AS FAR AS I
KNOW, THE WAY YOU GET CAST IN A MOVIE

1345
01:01:26,022 --> 01:01:28,869
IS THE DIRECTOR ASKS YOU
TO BE IN IT.

1346
01:01:28,869 --> 01:01:32,736
>> OH, WOW, THAT SOUNDS SO MUCH
EASIER THAN AUDITIONING.

1347
01:01:32,736 --> 01:01:35,950
YOU'RE SUCH A GREAT ACTOR.
DO YOU HAVE ANY TRAINING?

1348
01:01:35,950 --> 01:01:40,752
>> NO.
I JUST DID IT, AND I WAS REALLY
GOOD.

1349
01:01:40,752 --> 01:01:42,986
>> AWESOME.
AWESOME.

1350
01:01:42,986 --> 01:01:44,671
I'M DEPRESSED NOW.
THANK YOU.

1351
01:01:44,671 --> 01:01:48,960
>> WELL, TREVIS ONLY PROMISED US
A FEW MINUTES, SO HE NEEDS TO
GO.

1352
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:53,539
>> LISTEN, THANKS, EVERYBODY.
I ADMIRE ALL OF YOU.

1353
01:01:53,539 --> 01:01:57,620
KEEP FOLLOWING YOUR DREAMS, AND
I KNOW Y'ALL ARE GOING TO BEAT
YOUR ILLNESS.

1354
01:01:57,886 --> 01:02:00,762
ONE LOVE.

1355
01:02:02,469 --> 01:02:07,498
>> DID HE THINK THIS WAS LIKE A
MAKE A WISH THING?

1356
01:02:07,498 --> 01:02:09,812
>> HOW ELSE WOULD I HAVE GOTTEN
HIM HERE?

1357
01:02:09,812 --> 01:02:14,009
OKAY.
NATALIE, LET'S SEE YOUR
MONOLOGUE.
WHAT'S IT FROM?

1358
01:02:14,009 --> 01:02:16,740
>> "THE NOTEBOOK."

1359
01:02:16,740 --> 01:02:22,277
>> WHY CHOOSE THAT?
WHY?

1360
01:02:44,527 --> 01:02:50,565
BUT BEFORE I MET YOU, I HAD TO

1361
01:02:50,567 --> 01:02:53,335
KISS A LOT OF FROGS.

1362
01:02:53,337 --> 01:02:55,003
AND BY THAT, I MEAN I USED ALL

1363
01:02:55,005 --> 01:02:57,439
THE APPS.

1364
01:02:57,441 --> 01:02:59,808
BUT SERIOUSLY, SOME OF THOSE

1365
01:02:59,810 --> 01:03:01,810
GUYS ON THOSE DATING APPS ARE

1366
01:03:01,812 --> 01:03:02,410
THE WORST.

1367
01:03:02,412 --> 01:03:05,013
BUT WHEN I MET YOU SIX YEARS

1368
01:03:05,015 --> 01:03:08,116
AGO, I KNEW I HAD FOUND THE ONE.

1369
01:03:08,118 --> 01:03:10,886
>> I LOVE YOU SO MUCH.

1370
01:03:10,888 --> 01:03:13,321
>> BEAUTIFUL VOWS, JILL.

1371
01:03:13,323 --> 01:03:14,456
NOW, SHOULD ANYONE PRESENT KNOW

1372
01:03:14,458 --> 01:03:16,858
OF ANY REASON THAT THIS COUPLE

1373
01:03:16,860 --> 01:03:26,635
SHOULD NOT BE JOINED IN HOLY

1374
01:03:26,637 --> 01:03:28,136
MATRIMONY, SPEAK NOW OR FOREVER

1375
01:03:28,138 --> 01:03:29,337
HOLD YOUR PEACE.

1376
01:03:29,339 --> 01:03:30,405
>> HEY.

1377
01:03:30,407 --> 01:03:31,072
EXCUSE ME.

1378
01:03:31,074 --> 01:03:32,307
LIKE OBJECTION, I GUESS.

1379
01:03:32,309 --> 01:03:33,208
>> I'M SORRY.

1380
01:03:33,210 --> 01:03:33,642
WHO ARE YOU?

1381
01:03:33,644 --> 01:03:37,078
>> I'M GARRETT FROM HINGE.

1382
01:03:37,080 --> 01:03:39,948
AKA, THE GUY WHO JUST RANDOMLY

1383
01:03:39,950 --> 01:03:43,151
CAUGHT A STRAY IN YOUR WEDDING

1384
01:03:43,153 --> 01:03:43,451
VOWS.

1385
01:03:43,453 --> 01:03:45,387
I GUESS CONGRATS ON GETTING

1386
01:03:45,389 --> 01:03:48,990
MARRIED TO LIKE A POINTY

1387
01:03:48,992 --> 01:03:51,326
LEONARDO DiCAPRIO.

1388
01:03:51,328 --> 01:03:51,826
>> YEAH.

1389
01:03:51,828 --> 01:03:53,561
I -- OH, MY GOD.

1390
01:03:53,563 --> 01:03:55,897
I REMEMBER YOU.

1391
01:03:55,899 --> 01:03:58,667
YES, WE WENT ON A HINGE DATE,

1392
01:03:58,669 --> 01:04:00,168
AND YOU KEPT SAYING I HAD

1393
01:04:00,170 --> 01:04:02,304
HUFFLEPUFF VIBES, BUT THE ASS OF

1394
01:04:02,306 --> 01:04:02,971
A SLYTHERIN.

1395
01:04:02,973 --> 01:04:03,571
>> YEAH.

1396
01:04:03,573 --> 01:04:05,674
THAT'S A HUGE COMPLIMENT.

1397
01:04:05,676 --> 01:04:07,509
>> LOOK, CAN YOU PLEASE JUST

1398
01:04:07,511 --> 01:04:07,876
LEAVE?

1399
01:04:07,878 --> 01:04:08,543
>> FINE.

1400
01:04:08,545 --> 01:04:11,313
I'LL JUST GO TO THE BATHROOM,

1401
01:04:11,315 --> 01:04:12,447
AND WHEN I COME BACK, WE CAN

1402
01:04:12,449 --> 01:04:14,215
FIGURE ALL THIS OUT.

1403
01:04:14,217 --> 01:04:15,984
>> FIGURE WHAT OUT?

1404
01:04:15,986 --> 01:04:18,653
HOW DID YOU EVEN FIND OUT ABOUT

1405
01:04:18,655 --> 01:04:19,721
THIS WEDDING?

1406
01:04:19,723 --> 01:04:21,256
>> MAYBE BECAUSE MY BEST FRIEND

1407
01:04:21,258 --> 01:04:25,727
IS THE ORGANIST HERE?

1408
01:04:25,729 --> 01:04:27,529
GARRETT, I KNOW YOUR FEELINGS

1409
01:04:27,531 --> 01:04:29,364
ARE HURT, AND THAT'S REALLY

1410
01:04:29,366 --> 01:04:29,664
HARD.

1411
01:04:29,666 --> 01:04:30,498
BUT NO MATTER WHAT, YOU CANNOT

1412
01:04:30,500 --> 01:04:34,269
KILL THEM.

1413
01:04:34,271 --> 01:04:34,736
ALL RIGHT.

1414
01:04:34,738 --> 01:04:39,674
I THOUGHT ABOUT IT, YOU GUYS,

1415
01:04:39,676 --> 01:04:40,709
AND IT'S EITHER ME OR HIM.

1416
01:04:40,711 --> 01:04:42,410
>> IT'S HIM.

1417
01:04:42,412 --> 01:04:44,179
AND PLEASE STOP STANDING LIKE

1418
01:04:44,181 --> 01:04:47,282
YOUR SHIRT.

1419
01:04:47,284 --> 01:04:49,017
>> THIS SUCKS.

1420
01:04:49,019 --> 01:04:49,384
WHATEVER.

1421
01:04:49,386 --> 01:04:51,453
I'M NOT EVEN ON HINGE ANYMORE.

1422
01:04:51,455 --> 01:04:54,456
NOT AFTER I GOT ACCEPTED TO

1423
01:04:54,458 --> 01:04:58,860
RAYA, AFTER I WENT VIRAL FOR

1424
01:04:59,663 --> 01:05:00,328
SCREAMING ON AN AIRPLANE.

1425
01:05:00,330 --> 01:05:03,732
AND, YES, I MATCHED WITH THE

1426
01:05:03,734 --> 01:05:05,600
RACHEL DOLISOL.

1427
01:05:05,602 --> 01:05:07,168
>> I'M SO SORRY THIS IS

1428
01:05:07,170 --> 01:05:07,569
HAPPENING.

1429
01:05:07,571 --> 01:05:10,271
>> IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT, BABE.

1430
01:05:10,273 --> 01:05:11,172
>> OH, BRIAN.

1431
01:05:11,174 --> 01:05:13,775
SORRY, THAT WAS MY STEWIE

1432
01:05:13,777 --> 01:05:14,542
GRIFFIN IMPRESSION.

1433
01:05:14,544 --> 01:05:16,845
>> GARRETT, THAT WAS ACTUALLY AN

1434
01:05:16,847 --> 01:05:17,379
AMAZING IMPRESSION.

1435
01:05:17,381 --> 01:05:20,548
YOU KNOW, I DO A PRETTY GOOD

1436
01:05:20,550 --> 01:05:20,982
LOIS MYSELF.

1437
01:05:20,984 --> 01:05:21,483
>> LET'S HEAR IT.

1438
01:05:21,485 --> 01:05:23,351
>> PETER!

1439
01:05:23,353 --> 01:05:25,020
>> IT'S LIKE SHE'S IN THE ROOM

1440
01:05:25,022 --> 01:05:25,487
WITH ME.

1441
01:05:25,489 --> 01:05:27,956
>> IT'S TIME FOR BED, STEWIE!

1442
01:05:27,958 --> 01:05:31,393

1443
01:05:31,395 --> 01:05:33,061

1444
01:05:33,063 --> 01:05:35,697

1445
01:05:35,699 --> 01:05:37,766
BRIAN, YOU'RE BEING RIDICULOUS!

1446
01:05:37,768 --> 01:05:39,934
>> RIDICULOUS?

1447
01:05:39,936 --> 01:05:40,201
WOW.

1448
01:05:40,203 --> 01:05:42,470

1449
01:05:42,472 --> 01:05:43,271
HIS WEDDING DAY.

1450
01:05:43,273 --> 01:05:46,908
YOU KNOW, THAT NASTY LITTLE YUM

1451
01:05:46,910 --> 01:05:48,743
NOTHING ATTITUDE IS EXACTLY WHY

1452
01:05:48,745 --> 01:05:50,578
I BROKE UP WITH YOUR SORRY ASS.

1453
01:05:50,580 --> 01:05:51,913
>> YOU KNOW WHAT, THIS IS

1454
01:05:51,915 --> 01:05:52,947
GETTING OUT OF CONTROL.

1455
01:05:52,949 --> 01:05:54,816
ME AND GARRETT ARE GOING TO GO

1456
01:05:54,818 --> 01:05:57,419
TO THE BATHROOM AND WE CAN

1457
01:05:57,421 --> 01:05:58,319
FIGURE ALL THIS OUT.

1458
01:05:58,321 --> 01:05:58,653
>> WHAT?

1459
01:05:58,655 --> 01:06:02,157
BRIAN, NO!

1460
01:06:02,159 --> 01:06:05,393
>> I KNOW IT'S HARD, BRIAN.

1461
01:06:05,395 --> 01:06:07,662
I KNOW SHE HURT YOUR FEELINGS,

1462
01:06:07,664 --> 01:06:09,831
BUT NO MATTER WHAT, YOU CANNOT

1463
01:06:09,833 --> 01:06:10,231
KILL HER.

1464
01:06:10,233 --> 01:06:11,199
>> BUT I REALLY WANT TO.

1465
01:06:11,201 --> 01:06:12,267
>> I KNOW.

1466
01:06:12,269 --> 01:06:14,169
IT'S SO TEMPTING.

1467
01:06:14,171 --> 01:06:17,272
WHY DID I BRING MY BOOK OF

1468
01:06:17,274 --> 01:06:17,605
SPELLS?

1469
01:06:17,607 --> 01:06:19,240
>> GOSH, AND I REALLY WISH I

1470
01:06:19,242 --> 01:06:21,910
DIDN'T BRING MY KILLING WAND.

1471
01:06:21,912 --> 01:06:23,945

1472
01:06:23,947 --> 01:06:25,380
GETTING REALLY TOXIC FOR ME.

1473
01:06:25,382 --> 01:06:27,015
I JUST NEED TO REMOVE MYSELF

1474
01:06:27,017 --> 01:06:27,549
FROM THE SITUATION.

1475
01:06:27,551 --> 01:06:31,886
GOOD-BYE, BRIAN.

1476
01:06:31,888 --> 01:06:34,989
>> GOOD-BYE, GARRETT.

1477
01:06:34,991 --> 01:06:35,857
