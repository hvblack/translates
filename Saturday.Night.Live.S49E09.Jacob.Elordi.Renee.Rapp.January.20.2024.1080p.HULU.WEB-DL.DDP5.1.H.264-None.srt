1
00:00:02,861 --> 00:00:06,449
DISTRICT COURT

2
00:00:07,595 --> 00:00:12,594
>>> OKAY.
OKAY.
EVERYONE, SETTLE DOWN.
SETTLE DOWN.

3
00:00:12,594 --> 00:00:16,349
MY NAME IS ALINA HABBA.
I'M THE ATTORNEY FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP

4
00:00:16,349 --> 00:00:19,570
IN THE SECOND DEFAMATION
TRIAL OF E. JEAN CARROLL.

5
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:23,352
THE JUDGE HAS BEEN VERY UNFAIR
FROM THE BEGINNING,

6
00:00:23,352 --> 00:00:25,436
AND I WANT
TO MAKE THIS PERFECTLY CLEAR,

7
00:00:25,436 --> 00:00:29,910
I AM NEW AT THIS, AND I AM
LEARNING.

8
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:33,907
NOW, THE PRESIDENT MAY OR MAY
NOT STOP FOR BRIEF REMARKS,

9
00:00:33,907 --> 00:00:36,820
BUT
DUE TO A STRICT GAG ORDER, HE
WILL NOT BE COMMENTING

10
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:41,072
ON
ANYTHING PERTAINING TO THIS
CASE, MS. CARROLL, OR THE JUDGE.

11
00:00:41,072 --> 00:00:42,640
HE

12
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,691
>> THANK YOU, ALINA.
YOU'RE GREAT ON TV.

13
00:00:46,691 --> 00:00:50,851
MAYBE THE WORST LAWYER I'VE EVER
HAD, WHICH IS QUITE AN
ACCOMPLISHMENT.

14
00:00:50,851 --> 00:00:54,306
LOOK AT THIS TEAM.
THIS IS THE BOTTOM OF THE
BARREL, FOLKS.

15
00:00:54,306 --> 00:00:56,128
THIS IS WHO SAID YES.

16
00:00:56,128 --> 00:01:00,045
I'M IN THE LEAD FOR PRESIDENT,
AND THIS IS THE BEST I CAN GET.

17
00:01:00,045 --> 00:01:02,734
FEELS LIKE A RED FLAG, NO?

18
00:01:02,734 --> 00:01:05,152
WELL, YOU'RE NOT GETTING PAID BY
THE WAY.

19
00:01:05,152 --> 00:01:06,858
YOU KNOW THAT?
OF COURSE YOU DO.

20
00:01:06,858 --> 00:01:09,087
ALL RIGHT.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU, GUYS.

21
00:01:09,087 --> 00:01:11,810
SEE YOU AT SHAKY'S.
YOU CAN GET OUT OF HERE.

22
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:14,644
BUT WE ARE HERE AT COURTHOUSE,

23
00:01:14,644 --> 00:01:19,594
AND, YES, WE WILL BE ABIDING BY
THIS HORRIBLE GAG ORDER,

24
00:01:19,594 --> 00:01:24,029
SO I
WILL NOT BE SAYING THAT THE
JUDGE IS AN IDIOT

25
00:01:24,029 --> 00:01:27,619
OR WHERE HE
LIVES OR WHAT KIND OF CRAPPY CAR
HE DRIVES.

26
00:01:27,619 --> 00:01:30,440
I DIDN'T KNOW THEY STILL MADE
WAGONEERS, BUT

27
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:33,161
IT'S A TERRIBLE
TIME FOR OUR COUNTRY.

28
00:01:33,161 --> 00:01:36,943
I AM STANDING WEIRDER THAN EVER.

29
00:01:37,145 --> 00:01:42,062
ARMS LIKE A GI JOE, LEGS LIKE
THE SMOOTH CRIMINAL VIDEO.

30
00:01:42,062 --> 00:01:46,083
LOOK LIKE I'M ALWAYS IN SKI
BOOTS.
MAKE IT MAKE SENSE.

31
00:01:46,083 --> 00:01:47,878
WE JUST GOT BACK FROM IOWA

32
00:01:47,878 --> 00:01:51,445
WHERE WE WON VERY BIG, VERY BIG IN
IOWA.

33
00:01:51,445 --> 00:01:54,222
I WANT TO CONGRATULATE MR. DeSANTIS

34
00:01:54,222 --> 00:01:57,522
ON A TRULY
EMBARRASSING SHOWING.

35
00:01:57,594 --> 00:02:02,086
HE WENT TO 99 COUNTIES, BUT
BITCH COULDN'T WIN ONE.

36
00:02:02,086 --> 00:02:04,773
RON DESTUPID.

37
00:02:04,773 --> 00:02:09,373
RON DESTUPID.
IT JUST WORKS.
WE'RE GOING WITH RON DESTUPID.

38
00:02:09,373 --> 00:02:12,741
ALSO WANT TO CONGRATULATE
MR. RAMASWAMY.

39
00:02:12,741 --> 00:02:17,223
VIVEKAA. RAMASWAMY WHO DROPPED
OUT OF THE RACE

40
00:02:17,223 --> 00:02:19,730
AND HAS AGREED
TO LIVE IN MY SUIT POCKET.

41
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:22,589
I LOVE MY LITTLE RATATOUILLE.

42
00:02:22,589 --> 00:02:27,486
AS YOU CAN SEE, I AM DOING VERY
WELL COGNITIVELY.

43
00:02:27,486 --> 00:02:30,174
DOING GREAT WITH COGNITIVE.

44
00:02:30,174 --> 00:02:33,107
I'M MORE COGNITIVE THAN EVER.

45
00:02:33,107 --> 00:02:38,980
THE DOCTOR SAID, SIR, YOU HAVE
TO BE IN THE TOP 99%

46
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:42,422
OF ALL THE
CON THE CUSHION AND DEMENTIA
PEOPLE WE GIVE THIS TEST TO.

47
00:02:42,422 --> 00:02:47,020
I SAID, WELL, I GUESS I'M VERY
GOOD AT RECOGNIZING ELEPHANTS.
WHO KNEW.

48
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:51,429
AND NOW WE'RE HERE.
AND THIS IS THE CAMPAIGN, FOLKS.

49
00:02:51,429 --> 00:02:56,387
THIS IS ALL THERE IS, ME YELLING
IN COURTHOUSE LOBBY

50
00:02:56,387 --> 00:03:02,234
STANDING
BEHIND BARRICADE LIKE AFAMILY
AT JFK PICKUP.

51
00:03:02,234 --> 00:03:06,942
BUT NEXT IS NEW HAMPSHIRE
AGAINST NIKKI HALEY.

52
00:03:06,943 --> 00:03:10,158
DARLING

53
00:03:10,158 --> 00:03:14,479
NIKKI, NIKKI, SHE THOUGHT I WAS DONE,

54
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:19,445
BUT I'M BACK IN A BIG WAY.
I'M BACK LIKE "MEAN GIRLS."

55
00:03:19,445 --> 00:03:22,464
YEAH, WE LOVE "MEAN GIRLS."

56
00:03:22,464 --> 00:03:25,069
WHERE'S LACY SH?

57
00:03:25,069 --> 00:03:29,101
WHERE'S LACY?
LET OUT OF REMAKE.
SO SAD.

58
00:03:29,101 --> 00:03:32,337
YOU KNOW HER FATHER DID TOASTER
STRUDLE. BUT

59
00:03:32,337 --> 00:03:37,396
SHE'S DOING GREAT THINGS IN
TERMS OF HALLMARK MOVIES,
STAYING BUSY.
JUST LIKE ME.

60
00:03:37,396 --> 00:03:39,868
JUST LIKE ME, IT'S IMPORTANT TO
HAVE HOBBIES.

61
00:03:39,868 --> 00:03:42,183
BIDEN HAS FALLING DOWN.

62
00:03:42,183 --> 00:03:46,850
I HAVE MY MINITRIALS.
I LOVE BEING ON TRIAL.

63
00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:50,042
BUT BIDEN'S VERY CREEPY.

64
00:03:50,042 --> 00:03:52,198
HE SNIFFS LITTLE GIRLS' HAIR.

65
00:03:52,287 --> 00:03:56,356
I AM DIFFERENT OF COURSE.
I DO FAR WORSE THAN THAT.

66
00:03:56,356 --> 00:03:59,451
YOU EVER SEE THAT VIDEO OF ME
DANCING WITH EPSTEIN?

67
00:03:59,451 --> 00:04:01,497
BOY IS THIS SOME DARK ENERGY.

68
00:04:01,497 --> 00:04:06,473
CLAPPING OFF BEAT.
I GOT THE EUGENE LEVY EYEBROWS.
VERY STRANGE.

69
00:04:06,473 --> 00:04:09,398
TWIN

70
00:04:09,474 --> 00:04:12,149
I WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED IF THE
THAT FOOTAGE WAS FAKE.

71
00:04:12,149 --> 00:04:13,418
OF COURSE IT'S VERY REAL.

72
00:04:13,418 --> 00:04:17,659
BUT YOU HAVE TO THINK IN MANY
WAYS IT COULD NOT BE.

73
00:04:17,659 --> 00:04:22,338
WE'VE SEEN A LOT OF SUCCESS WITH
SAYING THINGS THAT DID NOT
HAPPEN.

74
00:04:22,338 --> 00:04:23,989
I THINK WE'LL CONTINUE TO DO
THAT.

75
00:04:23,989 --> 00:04:28,284
IT'S AN INNOVATION I'M
PARTICULARLY PROUD OF.
SEEMS TO BE WORKING VERY WELL.

76
00:04:28,346 --> 00:04:32,583
BUT I LOVE THIS COUNTRY AND ITS
TRADITIONS.

77
00:04:32,583 --> 00:04:36,948
THAT'S WHY I'M NOT DOING ANY
DEBATES AND BARELY DOING
ELECTION.

78
00:04:36,948 --> 00:04:39,600
I DON'T NEED TO.
MY PEOPLE LOVE ME.

79
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:44,081
I GOT THE OLD PEOPLE.
THEY'RE WAITING IN SNOW FOR TWO
HOURS TO VOTE FOR TRUMP.

80
00:04:44,081 --> 00:04:47,871
OH, DARLING, I'M DYING.
I GOT TO DO ONE LAST THING.

81
00:04:47,871 --> 00:04:49,841
I GOT TO VOTE FOR TRUMP.

82
00:04:49,841 --> 00:04:52,908
WE JUST NEED THEM TO STAY ALIVE
UNTIL NOVEMBER.

83
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,975
STAY ALIVE UNTIL NOVEMBER.
JUST PULL THAT LEVER AND DROP
DEAD.

84
00:04:58,063 --> 00:05:02,277
WHY?
BECAUSE I AM SENT BY GOD,

85
00:05:02,277 --> 00:05:05,905
AND
GOD HAS A PLAN FOR ME OR
WHATEVER.
I DON'T KNOW.

86
00:05:05,905 --> 00:05:09,381
BUT 2024 IS GOING TO BE A VERY
EXCITING YEAR.

87
00:05:09,381 --> 00:05:12,631
I'M EITHER GOING TO JAIL, BE
PRESIDENT,

88
00:05:12,631 --> 00:05:15,881
OR FRANKLY, THE
PURGE.

89
00:05:15,881 --> 00:05:19,075
PERHAPS ALL THREE.
LET'S SPIN THE CHAMBER.

90
00:05:19,075 --> 00:05:22,642
AND LIVE FROM NEW YORK, IT'S
SATURDAY NIGHT!

91
00:07:28,695 --> 00:07:33,898
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, JACOB
ELORDI!

92
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:55,009
THANK

93
00:07:55,108 --> 00:07:58,101
IT IS SO EXCITING TO BE HERE
HOSTING THE FIRST

94
00:07:58,101 --> 00:08:01,869
AND SO FAR
BEST SHOW OF 2024.

95
00:08:03,405 --> 00:08:06,470
SO YOU MIGHT KNOW ME FROM
SALTBURN.

96
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:08,509
NOT FROM --

97
00:08:08,509 --> 00:08:09,913
THANKS.

98
00:08:09,913 --> 00:08:14,271
NOT FROM SEEING THE FILM, JUST
FROM SEEING THE TIKTOKS.

99
00:08:14,271 --> 00:08:16,717
LIKE THIS SCENE.

100
00:08:19,336 --> 00:08:22,811
YEAH.
I WAS THE ONE IN THE GRAVE.

101
00:08:22,811 --> 00:08:26,276
BUT IF YOU SAW THE MOVIE, THANK
YOU.

102
00:08:31,089 --> 00:08:34,433
IF YOU SAW THE MOVIE WITH YOUR
PARENTS, I'M SORRY.

103
00:08:34,433 --> 00:08:39,070
AND IF YOU SAY YOU THE MOVIE
WITH YOUR GIRLFRIEND, YOU'RE
WELCOME.

104
00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:41,618
ANYWAY, I'M NOT MUCH OF A PUBLIC SPEAKER,

105
00:08:41,618 --> 00:08:45,345
SO I THOUGHT I WOULD
OPEN IT UP TO SOME QUESTIONS
FROM THE AUDIENCE.

106
00:08:45,345 --> 00:08:47,203
YES, YOU?

107
00:08:47,203 --> 00:08:50,374
>> HI, BABY GIRL.

108
00:08:50,374 --> 00:08:52,502
LOVED YOU IN PRISCILLA.

109
00:08:52,502 --> 00:08:55,854
WHAT'S YOUR FAVORITE VERSION
OF ELVIS?

110
00:08:55,854 --> 00:08:58,502
YOUNG ELVIS OR OLD ELVIS?

111
00:08:58,502 --> 00:09:02,612
>> IT'S PROBABLY "LILO AND
STITCH" ELVIS, YEAH.

112
00:09:02,612 --> 00:09:04,688
ALL RIGHT.
NEXT QUESTION.
YOU?

113
00:09:04,688 --> 00:09:07,437
>> HI.
NO QUESTION.

114
00:09:07,437 --> 00:09:10,393
JUST WANT TO LOOK AT YOU.

115
00:09:11,991 --> 00:09:13,650
>> ARE YOU DONE?

116
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:16,830
>> NOT YET.
ALMOST.

117
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:19,605
>> OKAY.
>> DONE.

118
00:09:19,605 --> 00:09:23,096
>> WHO ELSE HAS A QUESTION?
YES, YOU.

119
00:09:23,096 --> 00:09:25,121
>> OKAY.

120
00:09:25,121 --> 00:09:27,153
NO, NO!

121
00:09:27,153 --> 00:09:31,419
MY GOD, I THOUGHT I WOULD GET
BETTER APPLAUSE THAN THAT.

122
00:09:31,419 --> 00:09:35,421
NO.

123
00:09:35,421 --> 00:09:38,741
ANYWAY, JUST WANTED TO SAY I SAW
YOUR MOVIE,

124
00:09:38,741 --> 00:09:42,285
 AND I THOUGHT IT WAS
ABSOLUTELY GROSS.

125
00:09:42,285 --> 00:09:46,660
>> RIGHT.
YEAH.
WELL, "SALTBURN" REALLY ISN'T
FOR EVERYONE.

126
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:51,935
>> WHAT THE HELL IS A SALT BURN?
I'M TALKING ABOUT "THE KISSING
BOOTH."

127
00:09:54,388 --> 00:09:58,417
TWO PEOPLE KISSING ON THE MOUTH?
BLAH.

128
00:09:58,417 --> 00:10:02,555
>> KISSING IS KIND OF WEIRD WHEN
YOU THINK ABOUT IT.

129
00:10:02,555 --> 00:10:04,878
CAN YOU NAME ONE OTHER ANIMAL
THAT KISSES?

130
00:10:04,964 --> 00:10:07,394
>> EXCUSE ME, SIR.

131
00:10:09,702 --> 00:10:12,657
I BELIEVE I CAN NAME AN ANIMAL
THAT KISSES.

132
00:10:12,657 --> 00:10:15,231
>> YOU CAN?
>> YES.

133
00:10:15,231 --> 00:10:20,722
THE NOBLE ELEPHANT WILL
SOMETIMES PUT ITS TRUNK INTO ITS
LOVER'S MOUTH.

134
00:10:20,722 --> 00:10:22,691
>> HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?

135
00:10:22,691 --> 00:10:27,880
>> LET'S JUST SAY I OWN AN
ELEPHANT, AND I OPEN MY MOUTH A
LOT.

136
00:10:28,645 --> 00:10:31,579
>> OKAY.
I HAVE TIME FOR ONE MORE
QUESTION.

137
00:10:31,579 --> 00:10:32,541
YES, BOWEN?

138
00:10:32,541 --> 00:10:35,550
>> YOU KNOW HOW YOU WERE --

139
00:10:37,501 --> 00:10:39,851
MORE APPLAUSE THAN SARAH.

140
00:10:39,851 --> 00:10:44,030
YOU KNOW HOW YOU WERE BORN IN
AUSTRALIA?
I WAS ALSO BORN IN AUSTRALIA,

141
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:49,025
BUT WE MOVED WHEN I WAS A BABY,
SO MY ACCENT KIND OF GOES IN AND
OUT, MATE.

142
00:10:49,025 --> 00:10:52,401
>> COOL.
DID YOU HAVE A QUESTION?

143
00:10:52,401 --> 00:10:54,431
>> NO.

144
00:10:55,333 --> 00:10:57,190
>> GREAT JOB, BOWEN.

145
00:10:57,190 --> 00:11:00,161
BEFORE WE START, I JUST WANT TO
TAKE A MOMENT

146
00:11:00,161 --> 00:11:02,251
 TO SAY HOW
GRATEFUL I AM TO BE HERE.

147
00:11:02,251 --> 00:11:04,363
I'VE BEEN ACTING NOW FOR LIKE
SEVEN YEARS, 

148
00:11:04,363 --> 00:11:08,966
AND IT'S SO EASY TO
GET CAUGHT UP IN THE RUSH OF
TRYING TO GET TO THE NEXT THING
AND THE NEXT THING.

149

YOU KNOW HIS SLOGAN, YES WE CAN,

317
00:18:02,298 --> 00:18:03,798
I CAME UP WITH THAT.

318
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,733
BEFORE ME, HE WAS SAYING,

319
00:18:05,735 --> 00:18:08,503
PROBABLY, I THINK WE MIGHT.

320
00:18:08,505 --> 00:18:11,572
I WAS SUPPOSED TO BE IN AVATAR.

321
00:18:11,574 --> 00:18:13,608
JAMES CAMERON BEGGED ME TO BE IN

322
00:18:13,610 --> 00:18:13,975
IT.

323
00:18:13,977 --> 00:18:16,043
HE SAID I'LL SUCK YOUR PENIS.

324
00:18:16,045 --> 00:18:17,145
THERE WAS PEOPLE IN THE ROOM.

325

00:18:25,054 --> 00:18:25,353
WORLD.

329
00:18:25,355 --> 00:18:27,188
YOU DON'T THINK IT'S STRANGE ALL

330
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:29,690
THESE WOMEN GOT THE SAME NAME

I'M THE ONE WHO INVENTED FRUIT.

336
00:18:40,170 --> 00:18:42,537

337
00:18:42,539 --> 00:18:42,870
FRUIT.

338
00:18:42,872 --> 00:18:44,438
>> BEFORE ME, TREES WASN'T

339
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,573
BRINGING NOTHING TO THE TABLE.

340
00:18:45,575 --> 00:18:49,710
>> KATT WILLIAMS TELLS IT ALL,

341

348
00:19:03,159 --> 00:19:05,960
>> SEE, I JUST BEAT YOU.

349
00:19:05,962 --> 00:19:07,695
SHANNON, I AM THE ONLY MAN IN

00:37:27,462 --> 00:37:28,995
HAD THEN THE NEXT DAY, DONALD

828
00:37:28,997 --> 00:37:31,898
TRUMP REPEATEDLY CONFUSED NIKKI

829
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:34,234
HALEY WITH NANCY PELOSI.

830
00:37:34,236 --> 00:37:35,035
GUYS, I DON'T KNOW IF WE SHOULD

831
00:37:35,037 --> 00:37:35,935
DO THIS ELECTION.

832
00:37:35,937 --> 00:37:37,504
IT'S HONESTLY STARTING TO FEEL

833
00:37:37,506 --> 00:37:39,606
LIKE ELDER ABUSE.

834
00:37:39,608 --> 00:37:40,707
I DON'T EVEN BLAME THEM.

835
00:37:40,709 --> 00:37:42,409
I BLAME US FOR ALLOWING IT.

836
00:37:42,411 --> 00:37:46,980
IT REMINDS ME OF THOSE BUM FIGHT

837
00:37:46,982 --> 00:37:47,647
VIDEOS WHERE THEY MADE TWO

838
00:37:47,649 --> 00:37:49,983
HOMELESS GUYS FIGHT FOR MONEY,

839
00:37:49,985 --> 00:37:51,685
AND NOW WE LOOK BACK ON IT LIKE

840
00:37:51,687 --> 00:37:53,787
HOW DID WE LET THAT HAPPEN.

841
00:37:53,789 --> 00:37:56,122
I THINK THE BEST SOLUTION IS TO

842
00:37:56,124 --> 00:37:58,124
TELL TRUMP AND BIDEN THEY BOTH

843
00:37:58,126 --> 00:37:59,225
WON AND THAT WE'RE VERY PROUD OF

844
00:37:59,227 --> 00:37:59,526
THEM.

845
00:37:59,528 --> 00:38:05,965
AND THAT THEY CAN REST NOW.

846
00:38:05,967 --> 00:38:08,001
>> IN MONDAY'S IOWA CAUCUSES,

847
00:38:08,003 --> 00:38:11,137
RON DeSANTIS BEAT OUT NIKKI

848
00:38:11,139 --> 00:38:12,839
HALEY FOR SECOND PLACE.

849
00:38:12,841 --> 00:38:16,776
THAT OUGHT TO PUT A WHATEVER

850
00:38:16,778 --> 00:38:17,310
THIS IS ON HIS FACE.

851
00:38:17,312 --> 00:38:19,913
SOUTH CAROLINA SENATOR TIM SCOTT

852
00:38:19,915 --> 00:38:21,881
ENDORSED DONALD TRUMP, BUT

853
00:38:21,883 --> 00:38:24,050
REMEMBER MOST TRUMP SUPPORTERS

854
00:38:24,052 --> 00:38:27,454
ONLY COUNT HIM AS 3/5 OF AN

855
00:38:27,456 --> 00:38:27,854
ENDORSEMENT.

856
00:38:27,856 --> 00:38:29,723
OH, BOY.

857
00:38:29,725 --> 00:38:31,191
>> DONALD TRUMP URGED HIS

858
00:38:31,193 --> 00:38:33,426
SUPPORTERS TO BRAVE THE SUB ZERO

859
00:38:33,428 --> 00:38:35,628
TEMPERATURES IN IOWA TO VOTE FOR

860
00:38:35,630 --> 00:38:38,531
HIM SAYING EVEN IF YOU VOTE AND

861
00:38:38,533 --> 00:38:39,632
PASS AWAY, IT'S WORTH IT.

862
00:38:39,634 --> 00:38:41,167
VOTING FOR TRUMP AND PASSING

863
00:38:41,169 --> 00:38:41,901
AWAY IS ALSO WHAT HAPPENED WITH

864
00:38:41,903 --> 00:38:48,408
COVID.

865
00:38:48,410 --> 00:38:49,843
AFTER TRUMP WAS PHOTOGRAPHED

866
00:38:49,845 --> 00:38:51,277
WITH SOME STRANGE RED MARKS ON

867
00:38:51,279 --> 00:38:57,250
HIS HAND, SOME DERMATOLOGISTS

868
00:38:57,252 --> 00:38:58,685
SPECULATED IT COULD BE SOMETHING

869
00:38:58,687 --> 00:39:00,086
CALLED HAND HERPES.

870
00:39:00,088 --> 00:39:02,422
WHAT THE HELL IS HAND HERPES,

871
00:39:02,424 --> 00:39:04,524
SAID TIM SCOTT.

872
00:39:04,526 --> 00:39:07,293
>> JOHN KERRY ANNOUNCED HE IS

873
00:39:07,295 --> 00:39:08,695
STEPPING DOWN AS THE U.S.

874
00:39:08,697 --> 00:39:10,497
CLIMATE ENVOY AND IS EXPECTED TO

875
00:39:10,499 --> 00:39:12,165
FOCUS ON PRESIDENT BIDEN'S

876
00:39:12,167 --> 00:39:13,767
RE-ELECTION CAMPAIGN, AND IT'S

877
00:39:13,769 --> 00:39:17,203
NOT A GOOD SIGN THAT PRESIDENT

878
00:39:17,205 --> 00:39:20,006
BIDEN'S CAMPAIGN IS BIGGER THAN

879
00:39:20,008 --> 00:39:20,473
CLIMATE CHANGE.

880
00:39:20,475 --> 00:39:23,343
NIKKI HALEY SAID AMERICA HAS,

881
00:39:23,345 --> 00:39:24,811
QUOTE, NEVER BEEN A RACIST

882
00:39:24,813 --> 00:39:26,312
COUNTRY BECAUSE IF AMERICANS

883
00:39:26,314 --> 00:39:28,982
WERE SO RACIST, WHY DID THEY

884
00:39:28,984 --> 00:39:31,251
HAVE SEX WITH THEIR SLAVES?

885
00:39:31,253 --> 00:39:33,219
I'M GOING TO SLEEP LIKE A BABY

886
00:39:33,221 --> 00:39:33,686
TONIGHT.

887
00:39:33,688 --> 00:39:34,888
I REALLY AM.

888
00:39:34,890 --> 00:39:36,956
>> DONALD TRUMP POSTED AN IMAGE

889
00:39:36,958 --> 00:39:38,925
OF NIKKI HALEY MADE UP TO LOOK

890
00:39:38,927 --> 00:39:40,794
LIKE HILLARY CLINTON, AND

891
00:39:40,796 --> 00:39:42,128
HONESTLY I COULDN'T TELL IF IT

892
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:44,364
WAS BAD PHOTO SHOP OR A GOOD

893
00:39:44,366 --> 00:39:48,868
PICTURE OF MARK CUBAN IN A WIG.

894
00:39:48,870 --> 00:39:51,771
POPE FRANCIS CALLED FOR A BAN ON

895
00:39:51,773 --> 00:39:53,139
SURROGATE MOTHERHOOD, WHICH HE

896
00:39:53,141 --> 00:39:55,108
SAYS VIOLATES THE DIGNITY OF THE

897
00:39:55,110 --> 00:39:56,176
WOMAN AND THE CHILD.

898
00:39:56,178 --> 00:39:58,111
PLUS THE CATHOLIC CHURCH DOESN'T

899
00:39:58,113 --> 00:39:59,212
WANT EXTRA KIDS AROUND WHILE

900
00:39:59,214 --> 00:40:04,517
THEY'RE TRYING TO QUIT.

901
00:40:04,519 --> 00:40:08,121
>> LAST NIGHT AT A RALLY IN NEW

902
00:40:08,123 --> 00:40:09,189
HAMPSHIRE, SOUTH CAROLINA

903
00:40:09,191 --> 00:40:11,191
SENATOR TIM SCOTT SURPRISED MANY

904
00:40:11,193 --> 00:40:12,892
POLITICAL EXPERTS BY ENDORSING

905
00:40:12,894 --> 00:40:13,326
DONALD TRUMP.

906
00:40:13,328 --> 00:40:14,093
HERE TO EXPLAIN IS SENATOR TIM

907
00:40:14,095 --> 00:40:18,765
SCOTT.

908
00:40:19,234 --> 00:40:20,500
>> HELLO.

909
00:40:20,502 --> 00:40:21,835
IT'S GREAT TO BE HERE, MICHAEL.

910
00:40:21,837 --> 00:40:26,105
AND GREAT TO ENDORSE THE NEXT

911
00:40:26,107 --> 00:40:26,739
PRESIDENT OF THESE UNITED

912
00:40:26,741 --> 00:40:27,674
STATES, DONALD J. TRUMP.

913
00:40:27,676 --> 00:40:30,376
>> WOW, YOU HAVE A VERY UNIQUE

914
00:40:30,378 --> 00:40:31,044
VOICE, SENATOR.

915
00:40:31,046 --> 00:40:32,245
>> I KNOW.

916
00:40:32,247 --> 00:40:35,048
MY VOICE IS LIKE IF BILL LYNNTON

917
00:40:35,050 --> 00:40:35,982
WAS ACTUALLY BLACK.

918
00:40:35,984 --> 00:40:36,683
I SOUND LIKE THE PRINCESS AND

919
00:40:36,685 --> 00:40:39,352
THE FROG.

920
00:40:39,354 --> 00:40:41,421
I SOUND LIKE IF FOREST GUMP WAS

921
00:40:41,423 --> 00:40:44,390
DOING AN IMPRESSION OF JA RULE.

922
00:40:44,392 --> 00:40:47,360
WHERE WOULD I BE WITHOUT MY

923
00:40:47,362 --> 00:40:48,027
BABY.

924
00:40:48,029 --> 00:40:48,528
THAT'S AWESOME.

925
00:40:48,530 --> 00:40:50,864
>> A LOT OF FOLKS WERE SURPRISED

926
00:40:50,866 --> 00:40:52,899
THAT YOU OF ALL PEOPLE ENDORSED

927
00:40:52,901 --> 00:40:54,934
DONALD TRUMP?

928
00:40:54,936 --> 00:40:55,268
>> WHY?

929
00:40:55,270 --> 00:40:57,170
BECAUSE I'M BLACK?

930
00:40:57,172 --> 00:40:58,505
THAT'S VERY MISGUIDED.

931
00:40:58,507 --> 00:40:59,239
I DON'T SEE COLOR.

932
00:40:59,241 --> 00:41:01,374
WHEN I LOOKED AT ALL THE PEOPLE

933
00:41:01,376 --> 00:41:03,676
AT TRUMP'S RALLY, I DID NOT SEE

934
00:41:03,678 --> 00:41:04,377
A SINGLE COLOR.

935
00:41:04,379 --> 00:41:05,979
>> IT'S SURPRISING BECAUSE YOU

936
00:41:05,981 --> 00:41:07,680
TURNED ON NIKKI HALEY.

937
00:41:07,682 --> 00:41:09,716
SHE APPOINTED YOU TO BE SENATOR,

938
00:41:09,718 --> 00:41:11,551
AND NOW YOU'RE ENDORSING HER

939
00:41:11,553 --> 00:41:11,851
RIVAL?

940
00:41:11,853 --> 00:41:13,219
>> NIKKI AND I WILL ALWAYS BE

941
00:41:13,221 --> 00:41:16,189
CLOSE FRIENDS, BUT NICKY, OR AS

942
00:41:16,191 --> 00:41:19,425
MR. TRUMP TOLD ME TO CALL HER --

943
00:41:20,095 --> 00:41:20,460
LANGUAGE ]

944
00:41:20,462 --> 00:41:21,728
-- SHE MAY NOT EVEN BE FROM

945
00:41:21,730 --> 00:41:22,795
SOUTH CAROLINA OR EVEN AMERICA.

946
00:41:22,797 --> 00:41:25,565
>> SENATOR, YOU KNOW THAT'S NOT

947
00:41:25,567 --> 00:41:25,865
TRUE.

948
00:41:25,867 --> 00:41:29,068
THOSE ARE JUST RACIST DOG

949
00:41:29,070 --> 00:41:29,435
WHISTLES.

950
00:41:29,437 --> 00:41:32,171
>> MICHAEL, THAT'S NOT A RACIST

951
00:41:32,173 --> 00:41:32,572
DOG WHISTLE.

952
00:41:32,574 --> 00:41:34,307
THIS IS.

953
00:41:34,309 --> 00:41:36,509
>> WHAT IS THAT NOISE?

954
00:41:46,087 --> 00:41:48,087
>> WHAT DO YOU SAY TO PEOPLE WHO

955
00:41:48,089 --> 00:41:49,689
THINK TRUMP IS ONLY USING YOU TO

956
00:41:49,691 --> 00:41:51,157
WIN THE BLACK VOTES?

957
00:41:51,159 --> 00:41:53,159
>> LOOK, THAT IS IMPOSSIBLE

958
00:41:53,161 --> 00:41:53,927
BECAUSE BLACK PEOPLE DO NOT LIKE

959
00:41:53,929 --> 00:41:54,193
ME.

960
00:41:54,195 --> 00:41:56,796
ALL RIGHT?

961
00:41:56,798 --> 00:41:59,465
ONE TIME I SAID THE N WORD AT A

962
00:41:59,467 --> 00:42:00,733
BARBERSHOP, AND EVERYONE WENT,

963
00:42:00,735 --> 00:42:02,468
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

964
00:42:02,470 --> 00:42:04,637
SO WHEN MR. TRUMP ASKED ME TO

965
00:42:04,639 --> 00:42:07,373
CAMPAIGN FOR HIM IN INTERCITIES

966
00:42:07,375 --> 00:42:09,943
LIKE DETROIT AND PHILADELPHIA, I

967
00:42:09,945 --> 00:42:11,978
SAID WHY DON'T WE START IN NEW

968
00:42:11,980 --> 00:42:12,378
HAMPSHIRE?

969
00:42:12,380 --> 00:42:13,513
THOSE ARE MY PEOPLE.

970
00:42:13,515 --> 00:42:15,048
>> NOW THERE'S SPECULATION ABOUT

971
00:42:15,050 --> 00:42:18,451
YOUR POLITICAL FUTURE.

972
00:42:18,453 --> 00:42:19,152
IF TRUMP PICKS YOU TO BE HIS

973
00:42:19,154 --> 00:42:19,986
RUNNING MATE, WOULD YOU DO IT?

974
00:42:19,988 --> 00:42:20,920
>> ABSOLUTELY.

975
00:42:20,922 --> 00:42:25,792
I WOULD BE HONORED.

976
00:42:25,794 --> 00:42:27,660
>> REALLY?

977
00:42:27,662 --> 00:42:28,494
EVEN THOUGH HE HO TOLD A MOB TO

978
00:42:28,496 --> 00:42:29,596
HANG HIS LAST ONE?

979
00:42:29,598 --> 00:42:32,565
>> HE DID WHAT?

980
00:42:32,567 --> 00:42:33,733
>> TIM SCOTT, EVERYBODY.

981
00:42:33,735 --> 00:42:36,102
>> A NEW REPORT FINDS THE

982
00:42:36,104 --> 00:42:37,804
AVERAGE 50-YEAR-OLD IN AMERICA

983
00:42:37,806 --> 00:42:40,273
IS WORTH OVER $1 MILLION WHILE

984
00:42:40,275 --> 00:42:41,674
THE AVERAGE 30-YEAR-OLD IS WORTH

985
00:42:41,676 --> 00:42:44,344
MORE DEAD THAN ALIVE.

986
00:42:44,346 --> 00:42:47,914
>> ELTON JOHN WON AN EMMY FOR

987
00:42:47,916 --> 00:42:50,850
HIS FAIR WELL CONCERT SPECIAL

988
00:42:50,852 --> 00:42:53,586
EARNING HIM A COVETED E.G.O.T.,

989
00:42:53,588 --> 00:42:55,955
WHICH IS AN EMMY, A GRAMMY, AN

990
00:42:55,957 --> 00:42:59,225
OSCAR, AND A TONY.

991
00:42:59,227 --> 00:43:00,460
A NEW STARTUP COMPANY IS

992
00:43:00,462 --> 00:43:02,228
DEVELOPING A MALE CONTRACEPTIVE

993
00:43:02,230 --> 00:43:04,664
THAT INVOLVES ONE INJECTION THAT

994
00:43:04,666 --> 00:43:08,401

A PASSENGER ON SPIRIT AIRLINES

THEIR CARS TO CHARGE.

1015
00:43:50,679 --> 00:43:52,078
ON THE PLUS SIDE, THEY WERE ABLE

1016
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:52,745
TO STAY WARM IN THE BATTERY

1017
00:43:52,747 --> 00:43:57,050

1034

THEIR BABIES AS LONG AS THEY'RE

1035

THIS WAS A NICE STORY OVER THE

HOLIDAYS, NEARLY 20 DRIVERS ON

TOGETHER AGAIN TO SEND BEAN BACK

1048

WHERE HE CAME FROM.

WHAT'S HAPPENING?

>> SO DEOBRE, WHAT COMPELLED YOU

1059
00:45:27,842 --> 00:45:29,609
TO ATTACK THE JUDGE LIKE THAT?

1060
00:45:29,611 --> 00:45:32,145
>> MAN, YOU ASKING THE WRONG

QUESTIONS, CHE.

00:45:38,386 --> 00:45:39,952
IN THE HER OWN DAMN COURTROOM.

1066
00:45:39,954 --> 00:45:42,121
HOW HARD IS IT TO CATCH A GROWN

LAW, MAN?

1069

>> SO YOU TRYING TO SAY THIS IS

1070
00:45:47,662 --> 00:45:48,127
NOT YOUR FAULT?

1071
00:45:48,129 --> 00:45:49,162
>> WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY IS

1072
00:45:49,164 --> 00:45:51,764
EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM

1073
00:45:51,766 --> 00:45:54,300
SHERIFFS NEED TO BE FIRED.

1074
00:45:54,302 --> 00:45:55,768
PLAY THE CLIP AGAIN.

1075
00:45:55,770 --> 00:45:57,904

ADD.

1078

WHAT Y'ALL DON'T SEE IS THE

1079
00:46:02,610 --> 00:46:04,644
BAILIFF IS BEHIND ME RUBBING HIS

1080
00:46:04,646 --> 00:46:07,747
HANDS ON HIS BELLY LIKE THIS

1081
00:46:07,749 --> 00:46:09,415
STRAIGHT DAYDREAMING.

1082
00:46:09,417 --> 00:46:10,783
YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEAN.

1083
00:46:10,785 --> 00:46:12,685
HOME BOY WAS THINKING ABOUT A

1084
00:46:12,687 --> 00:46:12,985
SNACK.

1085
00:46:12,987 --> 00:46:13,986
LET ME BREAK IT DOWN.

1086
00:46:13,988 --> 00:46:15,822
WHILE I FLY THIS WAY, THE

1087
00:46:15,824 --> 00:46:17,690
BAILIFF, HE RUN BEHIND ME, HE

1088
00:46:17,692 --> 00:46:18,291
FALL DOWN.

LOOK AT HIM, MAN.

1090
00:46:19,527 --> 00:46:21,928
THAT'S TERRIBLE.

1091
00:46:21,930 --> 00:46:24,263
MAN, PUT THE DUNKIN DOWN, PICK

1092
00:46:24,265 --> 00:46:26,232
UP THE TASER, AND DO SOMETHING,

1093
00:46:26,234 --> 00:46:26,532
MAN.

1094
00:46:26,534 --> 00:46:29,602
I WAS IN THE AIR FOR LIKE FOUR,

1095
00:46:29,604 --> 00:46:30,336
FIVE, SIX GOOD SECONDS.

1096
00:46:30,338 --> 00:46:30,803
SHAME ON THEM.

1097
00:46:30,805 --> 00:46:32,305
>> YOU DO HAVE A POINT.

1098
00:46:32,307 --> 00:46:34,941
THAT WAS CRAZY.

1099
00:46:34,943 --> 00:46:35,675
I DON'T THINK A JUDGE HAS EVER

1100
00:46:35,677 --> 00:46:39,579
BEEN ATTACKED IN THEIR OWN

1101
00:46:39,581 --> 00:46:40,079
COURTROOM BEFORE.

1102
00:46:40,081 --> 00:46:40,479
>> EXACTLY.

IT WAS CRAZY I MADE CONTACT.

1104
00:46:43,651 --> 00:46:44,083
I WAS SHOCKED.

1105
00:46:44,085 --> 00:46:45,418
WHY THIS JUDGE WASN'T BEHIND

1106
00:46:45,420 --> 00:46:46,552
SOME GLASS, MAN.

1107
00:46:46,554 --> 00:46:49,388
HOW IS THIS MY FAULT?

1108
00:46:49,390 --> 00:46:50,823
I WAS BLUFFING.

1109
00:46:50,825 --> 00:46:52,558
I THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO BOUNCE

1110
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:53,993
OFF SOME GLASS.

1111
00:46:53,995 --> 00:46:55,928
>> WHAT GLASS?

1112
00:46:55,930 --> 00:46:56,963
>> EVERYBODY GOT GLASS.

1113
00:46:56,965 --> 00:47:01,200
CAB DRIVERS GOT CLASS, EVEN CVS

1114
00:47:01,202 --> 00:47:02,635
SHAMPOO GOT SOME GLASS, MAN.

1115
00:47:02,637 --> 00:47:05,071
AS I WAS RUNNING, I THOUGHT,

1116
00:47:05,073 --> 00:47:08,941
MAN, THERE FOR SURE GOING TO BE

1117
00:47:08,943 --> 00:47:10,576
SOME GLASS.

1118
00:47:10,578 --> 00:47:11,644
YOU FEEL ME?

1119
00:47:11,646 --> 00:47:14,146
>> DO YOU FEEL ANY REMORSE?

1120
00:47:14,148 --> 00:47:15,581
>> OF COURSE I DO.

1121
00:47:15,583 --> 00:47:19,352
I WAS TRYING TO SHAKE HER UP A

1122
00:47:19,354 --> 00:47:21,721
BIT, AND WHEN I GOT CONTACT, I

1123
00:47:21,723 --> 00:47:23,656
WAS LIKE, MAN.

1124
00:47:23,658 --> 00:47:25,291
LOOK AT THIS.

1125
00:47:25,293 --> 00:47:26,392
CAN YOU BELIEVE WHEN THEY

1126
00:47:26,394 --> 00:47:27,894
BROUGHT ME BACK TO COURT, THEY

1127
00:47:27,896 --> 00:47:30,563
PUT A MUZZLE ON ME, MAN?

1128
00:47:30,565 --> 00:47:32,498
>> PROBABLY FOR EVERYBODY'S

1129
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:32,832
SAFETY.

1130
00:47:32,834 --> 00:47:34,166
>> I DIDN'T BITE NOBODY.

1131
00:47:34,168 --> 00:47:36,302
NOW THEY JUST GASSING IT.

1132
00:47:36,304 --> 00:47:38,371
I DIDN'T DO NO MOUTH STUFF!

1133
00:47:38,373 --> 00:47:40,239
>> YOUR SISTER SPOKE UP FOR YOU

1134
00:47:40,241 --> 00:47:42,108
SAYING YOU WERE HAVING A MENTAL

1135
00:47:42,110 --> 00:47:42,475
BREAKDOWN.

1136
00:47:42,477 --> 00:47:43,509
WAS THAT TRUE?

1137
00:47:43,511 --> 00:47:44,510
>> I BELIEVE THAT MAY HAVE BEEN

1138
00:47:44,512 --> 00:47:45,811
THE CASE, YES.

1139
00:47:45,813 --> 00:47:54,620
MENTALLY, IT WAS A BREAKDOWN.

1140
00:47:54,622 --> 00:47:56,722
BUT ATHLETICALLY, IT WAS GREAT,

1141
00:47:56,724 --> 00:47:56,989
MAN.

1142
00:47:56,991 --> 00:47:59,058
BUT I TELL YOU WHAT, NOW WHEN I

1143

1144
00:48:02,597 --> 00:48:03,562
I BET Y'ALL THEY GOING TO HAVE

1145
00:48:03,564 --> 00:48:04,096
SOME GLASS.

1146
00:48:04,098 --> 00:48:06,265
>> THAT'S ENOUGH.

1147
00:48:06,267 --> 00:48:07,433
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

1148

I'M PRAYING THAT Y'ALL DIVORCE.

1151
00:48:41,052 --> 00:48:43,019
BUT NOW I'M SOBER.

1152
00:48:43,021 --> 00:48:44,387

1153
00:48:44,389 --> 00:48:48,424

SORRY.

1156
00:48:49,927 --> 00:48:51,827
IS THIS AN AA MEETING?

1157
00:48:51,829 --> 00:48:53,896
>> THIS IS A WOMEN'S MEETING,

1158
00:48:53,898 --> 00:48:54,163
GUY.

1159
00:48:54,165 --> 00:48:55,631
>> OH, MY BAD.

1160
00:48:55,633 --> 00:48:57,199
THE DIRECTORY SAID THERE'S A

1161
00:48:57,201 --> 00:48:58,467
MEETING IN ST. JOHN'S.

1162
00:48:58,469 --> 00:49:00,302
>> DUDE, LOOK AT THE SIGN.

1163
00:49:00,304 --> 00:49:02,738
WOMEN SUPPORTING WOMEN.

1164
00:49:02,740 --> 00:49:03,305
>> OKAY.

1165
00:49:03,307 --> 00:49:04,774
NO WORRIES.

1166
00:49:04,776 --> 00:49:05,441
WELL, I'LL TELL THE JUDGE I

1167
00:49:05,443 --> 00:49:13,416
TRIED.

1168
00:49:13,418 --> 00:49:14,850
>> CAN YOU BELIEVE HIM?

1169
00:49:15,286 --> 00:49:16,018
I'M JUST REALLY GRATEFUL TO HAVE

1170
00:49:16,020 --> 00:49:16,719
A GROUP OF WOMEN TO CONNECT

1171
00:49:16,721 --> 00:49:17,019
WITH.

1172
00:49:17,021 --> 00:49:17,420
>> I AGREE.

1173
00:49:17,422 --> 00:49:18,187
I HATED AA UNTIL I FOUND GIRLS.

1174
00:49:18,189 --> 00:49:20,189
>> MM.

1175
00:49:20,191 --> 00:49:22,591
>> SORRY TO INTERRUPT.

1176
00:49:22,593 --> 00:49:25,494
IS THIS AN AA MEETING?

1177
00:49:25,496 --> 00:49:25,861
>> IT IS.

1178
00:49:25,863 --> 00:49:29,298
MOVE.

1179
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:30,766
SIT HERE.

1180
00:49:30,768 --> 00:49:31,133
SIT HERE.

1181
00:49:31,135 --> 00:49:31,500
>> UH-HUH.

1182
00:49:31,502 --> 00:49:34,136
YEAH.

1183
00:49:34,138 --> 00:49:36,205
>> DO YOU WANT TO INTRODUCE

1184
00:49:36,207 --> 00:49:38,174
YOURSELF TO THE GROUP?

1185
00:49:38,176 --> 00:49:39,508
>> SURE.

1186
00:49:39,510 --> 00:49:40,276
I GUESS.

1187
00:49:40,278 --> 00:49:41,043
MY NAME IS JOSHUA, AND I'M AN

1188
00:49:41,045 --> 00:49:43,045
ALCOHOLIC.

1189
00:49:43,047 --> 00:49:46,449
>> HI, JOSHUA.

1190
00:49:46,451 --> 00:49:47,550
>> AND I'M SOBER FOR 78 DAYS

1191
00:49:47,552 --> 00:49:49,585
NOW.

1192
00:49:49,587 --> 00:49:52,488
>> GET IT.

1193
00:49:52,490 --> 00:49:52,955
>> THANK YOU.

1194
00:49:52,957 --> 00:49:53,355
THANK YOU.

1195
00:49:53,357 --> 00:49:54,390
I APPRECIATE IT.

1196
00:49:54,392 --> 00:49:56,826
YOU KNOW I'M GRATEFUL TO BE

1197
00:49:56,828 --> 00:49:57,126
SOBER.

1198
00:49:57,128 --> 00:49:59,328
IT'S JUST, WHEN I'M SOBER OFF

1199
00:49:59,330 --> 00:50:01,797
DRUGS AND ALCOHOL, I ACT OUT

1200
00:50:01,799 --> 00:50:03,099
SEXUALLY WITH WOMEN.

1201
00:50:03,101 --> 00:50:03,666
>> MM.

1202
00:50:03,668 --> 00:50:05,301
>> OH, NO.

1203
00:50:05,303 --> 00:50:06,469
>> THAT IS TOUGH STUFF.

1204
00:50:06,471 --> 00:50:07,837
>> YOU GOT THIS, THOUGH.

1205
00:50:07,839 --> 00:50:09,071
>> ONE DAY AT A TIME.

1206
00:50:09,073 --> 00:50:12,942
>> BUT, YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW

1207
00:50:12,944 --> 00:50:15,444
IF I'M REPLACING ONE DRUG WITH

1208
00:50:15,446 --> 00:50:17,780
ANOTHER, AND I DON'T WANT TO BE

1209
00:50:17,782 --> 00:50:18,247
TOO GRAPHIC.

1210
00:50:18,249 --> 00:50:19,048
>> PLEASE DO.

1211
00:50:19,050 --> 00:50:20,883
BECAUSE I KNOW IT COULD HELP

1212
00:50:20,885 --> 00:50:21,217
SOMEONE.

1213
00:50:21,219 --> 00:50:23,252
FOR ME, HEARING A GRAPHIC STORY

1214
00:50:23,254 --> 00:50:26,055
KEEPS ME OFF THE BOTTLE.

1215
00:50:26,057 --> 00:50:26,722
>> MM HMM.

1216
00:50:26,724 --> 00:50:28,924
>> I ABSOLUTELY RUN THROUGH

1217
00:50:28,926 --> 00:50:29,225
WOMEN.

1218
00:50:29,227 --> 00:50:31,160
MY APPETITE IS INSATIABLE.

1219
00:50:31,162 --> 00:50:32,962
>> THAT IS SO SAD.

1220
00:50:32,964 --> 00:50:35,197
AND IS THERE AN AGE CUTOFF OR A

1221
00:50:35,199 --> 00:50:36,766
BODY TYPE YOU GO FOR?

1222
00:50:36,768 --> 00:50:39,201
>> NO, IT'S ANY AND ALL TYPES.

1223
00:50:39,203 --> 00:50:41,103
ALL OF THEM.

1224
00:50:41,105 --> 00:50:42,104
>> MM.

1225
00:50:42,106 --> 00:50:43,272
>> MM.

1226
00:50:43,274 --> 00:50:46,308
>> I HOPE I'M NOT TRIGGERING

1227
00:50:46,310 --> 00:50:46,642
ANYONE.

1228
00:50:46,644 --> 00:50:48,410
IN FACT, NOW THAT I'M LOOKING

1229
00:50:48,412 --> 00:50:50,679
AROUND, I FEEL LIKE I ONLY SEE

1230
00:50:50,681 --> 00:50:51,013
WOMEN.

1231
00:50:51,015 --> 00:50:52,681
>> WELL, USUALLY THERE'S MEN

1232
00:50:52,683 --> 00:50:54,049
HERE, BUT THEY'RE ALL AT THE

1233
00:50:54,051 --> 00:50:54,350
GAME.

1234
00:50:54,352 --> 00:50:54,984
>> WHAT GAME?

1235
00:50:54,986 --> 00:50:57,787
>> I DON'T KNOW.

1236
00:50:57,789 --> 00:50:58,220
COMICON.

1237
00:50:58,222 --> 00:51:00,623
BACK TO YOUR SOBRIETY.

1238
00:51:00,625 --> 00:51:01,624
YOU WERE SAYING SOMETHING ABOUT

1239
00:51:01,626 --> 00:51:04,160
BEING ATTRACTED TO ALL

1240
00:51:04,162 --> 00:51:04,593
ETHNICITIES.

1241
00:51:04,595 --> 00:51:04,960
>> YEAH.

1242
00:51:04,962 --> 00:51:06,929
THE LONGER I STAY SOBER, THE

1243
00:51:06,931 --> 00:51:10,099
MORE I ABSOLUTELY COMPULSIVELY

1244
00:51:10,101 --> 00:51:12,334
ACT OUT WITH WOMEN.

1245
00:51:12,336 --> 00:51:12,902
>> MM!

1246
00:51:12,904 --> 00:51:15,271
>> HEY, HEY, YOU HAVE TO DO WHAT

1247
00:51:15,273 --> 00:51:19,441
YOU HAVE TO DO FOR YOUR

1248
00:51:19,443 --> 00:51:20,009
SOBRIETY.

1249
00:51:20,011 --> 00:51:22,511
DON'T BEAT YOURSELF OFF -- UP.

1250
00:51:22,513 --> 00:51:24,647
>> I GUESS YOU'RE RIGHT.

1251
00:51:24,649 --> 00:51:26,348
BESIDES, IT'S NOTHING COMPARED

1252
00:51:26,350 --> 00:51:29,018
TO MY BEHAVIOR WHEN I WAS

1253
00:51:29,020 --> 00:51:29,618
DRINKING.

1254
00:51:29,620 --> 00:51:31,554
I WOULD ABSOLUTELY WEAR THOSE

1255
00:51:31,556 --> 00:51:33,689
POOR WOMEN LIKE A GAS MASK.

1256
00:51:33,691 --> 00:51:34,390
>> YOU KNOW, YOU COULD DRINK

1257
00:51:34,392 --> 00:51:36,992
AGAIN.

1258
00:51:36,994 --> 00:51:38,761
>> ARE YOU SURE THIS ISN'T A

1259
00:51:38,763 --> 00:51:39,295
WOMEN'S MEETING?

1260
00:51:39,297 --> 00:51:42,298
I MEAN, THAT SIGN SAYS WOMEN

1261
00:51:42,300 --> 00:51:43,566
SUPPORTING WOMEN.

1262
00:51:43,568 --> 00:51:45,401
>> IT'S PRINTED WRONG.

1263
00:51:45,403 --> 00:51:46,769
IT SHOULD SAY WOMEN SUPPORTING

1264
00:51:46,771 --> 00:51:49,205
WOMEN SUPPORTING YOU.

1265
00:51:49,207 --> 00:51:50,272
>> SORRY.

1266
00:51:50,274 --> 00:51:52,374
YOU WERE SAYING SOMETHING ABOUT

1267
00:51:52,376 --> 00:51:53,075
GIVING WOMEN THE DICKING OF A

1268
00:51:53,077 --> 00:51:55,177
LIFETIME?

1269
00:51:55,179 --> 00:51:56,212
>> OH, RIGHT.

1270
00:51:56,214 --> 00:51:58,280
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

1271
00:51:58,282 --> 00:52:00,683
I WAS NEVER A BETTER LOVER THAN

1272
00:52:00,685 --> 00:52:01,951
WHEN I WAS DRUNK.

1273
00:52:01,953 --> 00:52:03,853
I WAS PASSIONATE AND WILD, AND

1274
00:52:03,855 --> 00:52:06,388
IT WENT ALL NIGHT.

1275
00:52:06,390 --> 00:52:07,790
>> MM, MM, MM.

1276
00:52:07,792 --> 00:52:10,693
>> ALL IT TOOK WAS A COUPLE OF

1277
00:52:10,695 --> 00:52:11,026
BEERS.

1278
00:52:11,028 --> 00:52:11,861
>> OKAY.

1279
00:52:11,863 --> 00:52:13,362
THIS IS WEIRD, BUT THERE ARE

1280
00:52:13,364 --> 00:52:15,631
RANDOMLY TWO BEERS HERE.

1281
00:52:15,633 --> 00:52:18,267
>> I'M GOING TO BE SUPER

1282
00:52:18,269 --> 00:52:19,335
VULNERABLE WITH Y'ALL.

1283
00:52:19,337 --> 00:52:27,977
I'M FEELING THE URGE TO ACT OUT.

1284
00:52:27,979 --> 00:52:30,713
>> OH, THAT -- THAT IS TOTALLY

1285
00:52:30,715 --> 00:52:33,015
NORMAL.

1286
00:52:33,017 --> 00:52:38,087
I MEAN, HOW DO WE SUPPORT -- HOW

1287
00:52:38,089 --> 00:52:38,787
DO WE BEST SUPPORT YOU RIGHT

1288
00:52:38,789 --> 00:52:42,057
NOW?

1289
00:52:42,059 --> 00:52:44,860
>> OH, YOUR TOP HAS FALLEN

1290
00:52:44,862 --> 00:52:45,294
SLIGHTLY OPEN.

1291
00:52:45,296 --> 00:52:47,730
>> HAS IT?

1292
00:52:47,732 --> 00:52:49,398
I'M JUST OVERHEATED.

1293
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:50,532
I MEAN, MAYBE I'LL COOL DOWN IF

1294

I JUST BOUNCE.

1295

>> I'M VERY EXCITED FOR YOU TO

1495
00:58:32,009 --> 00:58:34,142
HEAR FIRSTHAND HOW HARD ACTORS

1496
00:58:34,144 --> 00:58:36,378
MUST WORK TO ACHIEVE SUCCESS.

1497
00:58:36,380 --> 00:58:37,913
I'M SURE YOU ALL HAVE QUESTIONS.

1498
00:58:37,915 --> 00:58:38,513
ASK AWAY.

1499
00:58:38,515 --> 00:58:40,549
>> SO, YEAH, YOU'RE AWESOME.

1500
00:58:40,551 --> 00:58:42,050
>> OH, THANKS, MAN.

1501
00:58:42,052 --> 00:58:44,353
THAT MEANS THE WORLD.

1502
00:58:44,355 --> 00:58:44,786
THANK YOU.

1503
00:58:44,788 --> 00:58:48,290
>> SO I'M LIKE THREE YEARS INTO

1504
00:58:48,292 --> 00:58:50,525
THE AUDITIONING GRIND, AND THE

1505
00:58:50,527 --> 00:58:53,328
NEEDLE HAS NOT MOVED FOR ME AT

1506
00:58:53,330 --> 00:58:53,595
ALL.

1507
00:58:53,597 --> 00:58:54,596
I'M CURIOUS HOW LONG DID IT TAKE

1508
00:58:54,598 --> 00:58:56,965
FOR YOU TO GET YOUR FIRST, LIKE,

1509
00:58:56,967 --> 00:58:58,867
BIG BREAK?

1510
00:58:58,869 --> 00:59:00,769
>> WELL, I FLEW TO LA TO GIVE

1511
00:59:00,771 --> 00:59:02,404
THE WHOLE HOLLYWOOD THING A

1512
00:59:02,406 --> 00:59:04,539
SHOT, AND AS I WALKED OFF THE

1513
00:59:04,541 --> 00:59:06,808
PLANE, SELENA GOMEZ CAME UP TO

1514
00:59:06,810 --> 00:59:08,944
ME, SAID I WAS GORGEOUS, AND

1515
00:59:08,946 --> 00:59:10,412
ASKED ME TO PLAY HER BOYFRIEND

1516
00:59:10,414 --> 00:59:12,381
IN A MUSIC VIDEO, AND THAT LED

1517
00:59:12,383 --> 00:59:14,549
TO THE MOVIES AND EVERYTHING.

1518
00:59:14,551 --> 00:59:15,183
>> OKAY.

1519
00:59:15,185 --> 00:59:17,219
SO THE MOMENT YOU STEPPED IN LA,

1520
00:59:17,221 --> 00:59:19,621
YOU GOT YOUR BIG BREAK?

1521
00:59:19,623 --> 00:59:19,921
COOL.

1522
00:59:19,923 --> 00:59:20,689
>> YEAH.

1523
00:59:20,691 --> 00:59:23,725
AND IT WAS ALL THANKS TO SELENA

1524
00:59:23,727 --> 00:59:24,026
GOMEZ.

1525
00:59:24,028 --> 00:59:24,926
ABSOLUTE SWEETHEART BY THE WAY.

1526
00:59:24,928 --> 00:59:25,761
>> OH, YEA.

1527
00:59:25,763 --> 00:59:26,161
I'M SO GLAD.

1528
00:59:26,163 --> 00:59:29,498
I LOVE HER.

1529
00:59:29,500 --> 00:59:31,967
>> HI.

1530
00:59:31,969 --> 00:59:33,402
SO I'VE BEEN AUDITIONING FOR

1531
00:59:33,404 --> 00:59:35,971
LIKE FIVE YEARS, AND I'VE GOT

1532
00:59:35,973 --> 00:59:36,304
NOTHING.

1533
00:59:36,306 --> 00:59:37,906
MY AGENT ACTUALLY TOLD ME IT'S

1534
00:59:37,908 --> 00:59:40,075
TIME TO CONSIDER PORN.

1535
00:59:40,077 --> 00:59:43,912
SO HOW DO YOU HANDLE REJECTION?

1536
00:59:43,914 --> 00:59:46,048
>> I FEEL SO DUMB RIGHT NOW.

1537
00:59:46,050 --> 00:59:50,452
I AM NOT FAMILIAR WITH THAT

1538
00:59:50,454 --> 00:59:50,752
WORD.

1539
00:59:50,754 --> 00:59:52,721
I'M NOT ON SOCIAL MEDIA.

1540
00:59:52,723 --> 00:59:53,822
IS IT LIKE A SLANG?

1541
00:59:53,824 --> 00:59:55,057
>> OH, NO.

1542
00:59:55,059 --> 00:59:56,324
REJECTION IS LIKE, I DON'T KNOW,

1543
00:59:56,326 --> 00:59:58,727
LIKE A PART OF THE HUMAN

1544
00:59:58,729 --> 00:59:59,127
CONDITION.

1545
00:59:59,129 --> 00:59:59,528
>> YEAH.

1546
00:59:59,530 --> 01:00:00,328
IT'S LIKE WHEN SOMEONE DOESN'T

1547
01:00:00,330 --> 01:00:01,229
WANT YOU FOR SOMETHING.

1548
01:00:01,231 --> 01:00:04,332
>> OH, NO.

1549
01:00:04,334 --> 01:00:04,599
NO.

1550
01:00:04,601 --> 01:00:09,571
THAT'S SO SAD.

1551
01:00:09,573 --> 01:00:09,871
YEAH.

1552
01:00:09,873 --> 01:00:10,572
REALLY, I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING

1553
01:00:10,574 --> 01:00:12,874
ABOUT THAT.

1554
01:00:12,876 --> 01:00:14,309
>> HI.

1555
01:00:14,311 --> 01:00:16,244
I'M SUCH A HUGE FAN OF YOURS.

1556
01:00:16,246 --> 01:00:18,046
>> ARE YOU KIDDING?

1557
01:00:18,048 --> 01:00:21,116
I'M A FAN OF YOURS.

1558
01:00:21,118 --> 01:00:24,186
SPOTLIGHT, THAT'S AMAZING.

1559
01:00:24,188 --> 01:00:25,387
>> NO.

1560
01:00:25,389 --> 01:00:27,289
I'M NOT RACHEL McADAMS.

1561
01:00:27,291 --> 01:00:30,425
I'M NATALIE PARTMAN.

1562
01:00:30,427 --> 01:00:33,028
SO ANYWAY, TO MAKE MONEY, I

1563
01:00:33,030 --> 01:00:35,964
STARTED AN ONLYFANS, AND I WAS

1564
01:00:35,966 --> 01:00:38,200
SUED BY RACHEL McADAMS, WHO

1565
01:00:38,202 --> 01:00:41,503
ACCUSED ME OF BEING A DEEP FAKE

1566
01:00:41,505 --> 01:00:43,905
HER, SO, ANYWAY, WHAT ADVICE DO

1567
01:00:43,907 --> 01:00:45,474
YOU HAVE FOR SOMEONE WHO LOOKS

1568
01:00:45,476 --> 01:00:46,975
LIKE A FAMOUS PERSON?

1569
01:00:46,977 --> 01:00:49,244
>> I MEAN, ARE YOU A BETTER

1570
01:00:49,246 --> 01:00:50,912
ACTRESS THAN RACHEL McADAMS?

1571
01:00:50,914 --> 01:00:51,446
>> I'LL ANSWER THAT.

1572
01:00:51,448 --> 01:00:53,381
NO.

1573
01:00:53,383 --> 01:00:54,216
>> OKAY.

1574
01:00:54,218 --> 01:00:55,417
THEN I WOULD SAY GIVE UP AND

1575
01:00:55,419 --> 01:00:57,385
STOP PURSUING A FILM CAREER.

1576
01:00:57,387 --> 01:01:00,155
>> GOT IT.

1577
01:01:00,157 --> 01:01:01,623
SO I'LL FOCUS ON TV.

1578
01:01:01,625 --> 01:01:05,961
NAMASTE.

1579
01:01:05,963 --> 01:01:06,695
>> OKAY.

1580
01:01:06,697 --> 01:01:08,697
HI, TREVIS.

1581
01:01:08,699 --> 01:01:10,499
I'M FAN BOYING OUT RIGHT NOW.

1582
01:01:10,501 --> 01:01:12,334
DON'T BE WEIRD.

1583
01:01:12,336 --> 01:01:15,670
DO YOU HAVE ANY, LIKE, AUDITION

1584
01:01:15,672 --> 01:01:16,204
HACKS?

1585
01:01:16,206 --> 01:01:17,339
>> I'M SORRY.

1586
01:01:17,341 --> 01:01:19,341
I KEEP HEARING THIS WORD,

1587
01:01:19,343 --> 01:01:19,708
AUDITION.

1588
01:01:19,710 --> 01:01:20,008
SORRY.

1589
01:01:20,010 --> 01:01:21,643
WHAT IS THAT?

1590
01:01:21,645 --> 01:01:24,079
>> IT'S WHERE YOU TRY OUT FOR A

1591
01:01:24,081 --> 01:01:24,379
PART.

1592
01:01:24,381 --> 01:01:25,080
>> OH, MY GOD.

1593
01:01:25,082 --> 01:01:28,517
THEY MAKE YOU DO THAT?

1594
01:01:28,519 --> 01:01:29,584
DUDE, I DON'T THINK THAT'S

1595
01:01:29,586 --> 01:01:29,918
ALLOWED.

1596
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:32,020
I MEAN, YOU KNOW, AS FAR AS I

1597
01:01:32,022 --> 01:01:34,623
KNOW, THE WAY YOU GET CAST IN A

1598
01:01:34,625 --> 01:01:38,059
MOVIE IS THE DIRECTOR ASKS YOU

1599
01:01:38,061 --> 01:01:38,493
TO BE IN IT.

1600
01:01:38,495 --> 01:01:40,162
>> OH, WOW, THAT SOUNDS SO MUCH

1601
01:01:40,164 --> 01:01:41,196
EASIER THAN AUDITIONING.

1602
01:01:41,198 --> 01:01:43,131
YOU'RE SUCH A GREAT ACTOR.

1603
01:01:43,133 --> 01:01:44,099
DO YOU HAVE ANY TRAINING?

1604
01:01:44,101 --> 01:01:44,733
>> NO.

1605
01:01:44,735 --> 01:01:45,534
I JUST DID IT, AND I WAS REALLY

1606
01:01:45,536 --> 01:01:48,837
GOOD.

1607
01:01:48,839 --> 01:01:49,771
>> AWESOME.

1608
01:01:49,773 --> 01:01:50,105
AWESOME.

1609
01:01:50,107 --> 01:01:50,605
I'M DEPRESSED NOW.

1610
01:01:50,607 --> 01:01:52,207
THANK YOU.

1611
01:01:52,209 --> 01:01:56,278
>> WELL, TREVIS ONLY PROMISED US

1612
01:01:56,280 --> 01:01:58,446
A FEW MINUTES, SO HE NEEDS TO

1613
01:01:58,448 --> 01:01:58,713
GO.

1614
01:01:58,715 --> 01:02:00,248
>> LISTEN, THANKS, EVERYBODY.

1615
01:02:00,250 --> 01:02:01,650
I ADMIRE ALL OF YOU.

1616
01:02:01,652 --> 01:02:04,052
KEEP FOLLOWING YOUR DREAMS, AND

1617
01:02:04,054 --> 01:02:06,121
I KNOW Y'ALL ARE GOING TO BEAT

1618
01:02:06,123 --> 01:02:07,722
YOUR ILLNESS.

1619
01:02:07,724 --> 01:02:11,092
ONE LOVE.

1620
01:02:11,094 --> 01:02:12,594
>> DID HE THINK THIS WAS LIKE A

1621
01:02:12,596 --> 01:02:15,397
MAKE A WISH THING?

1622
01:02:15,399 --> 01:02:17,465
>> HOW ELSE WOULD I HAVE GOTTEN

1623
01:02:17,467 --> 01:02:18,967
HIM HERE?

1624
01:02:18,969 --> 01:02:19,501
OKAY.

1625
01:02:19,503 --> 01:02:20,735
NATALIE, LET'S SEE YOUR

1626
01:02:20,737 --> 01:02:21,102
MONOLOGUE.

1627
01:02:21,104 --> 01:02:23,171
WHAT'S IT FROM?

1628
01:02:23,173 --> 01:02:25,340
>> "THE NOTEBOOK."

1629
01:02:25,342 --> 01:02:26,074
>> WHY CHOOSE THAT?

1630
01:02:26,076 --> 01:02:31,346
WHY?

1631
01:02:44,527 --> 01:02:50,565
BUT BEFORE I MET YOU, I HAD TO

1632
01:02:50,567 --> 01:02:53,335
KISS A LOT OF FROGS.

1633
01:02:53,337 --> 01:02:55,003
AND BY THAT, I MEAN I USED ALL

1634
01:02:55,005 --> 01:02:57,439
THE APPS.

1635
01:02:57,441 --> 01:02:59,808
BUT SERIOUSLY, SOME OF THOSE

1636
01:02:59,810 --> 01:03:01,810
GUYS ON THOSE DATING APPS ARE

1637
01:03:01,812 --> 01:03:02,410
THE WORST.

1638
01:03:02,412 --> 01:03:05,013
BUT WHEN I MET YOU SIX YEARS

1639
01:03:05,015 --> 01:03:08,116
AGO, I KNEW I HAD FOUND THE ONE.

1640
01:03:08,118 --> 01:03:10,886
>> I LOVE YOU SO MUCH.

1641
01:03:10,888 --> 01:03:13,321
>> BEAUTIFUL VOWS, JILL.

1642
01:03:13,323 --> 01:03:14,456
NOW, SHOULD ANYONE PRESENT KNOW

1643
01:03:14,458 --> 01:03:16,858
OF ANY REASON THAT THIS COUPLE

1644
01:03:16,860 --> 01:03:26,635
SHOULD NOT BE JOINED IN HOLY

1645
01:03:26,637 --> 01:03:28,136
MATRIMONY, SPEAK NOW OR FOREVER

1646
01:03:28,138 --> 01:03:29,337
HOLD YOUR PEACE.

1647
01:03:29,339 --> 01:03:30,405
>> HEY.

1648
01:03:30,407 --> 01:03:31,072
EXCUSE ME.

1649
01:03:31,074 --> 01:03:32,307
LIKE OBJECTION, I GUESS.

1650
01:03:32,309 --> 01:03:33,208
>> I'M SORRY.

1651
01:03:33,210 --> 01:03:33,642
WHO ARE YOU?

1652
01:03:33,644 --> 01:03:37,078
>> I'M GARRETT FROM HINGE.

1653
01:03:37,080 --> 01:03:39,948
AKA, THE GUY WHO JUST RANDOMLY

1654
01:03:39,950 --> 01:03:43,151
CAUGHT A STRAY IN YOUR WEDDING

1655
01:03:43,153 --> 01:03:43,451
VOWS.

1656
01:03:43,453 --> 01:03:45,387
I GUESS CONGRATS ON GETTING

1657
01:03:45,389 --> 01:03:48,990
MARRIED TO LIKE A POINTY

1658
01:03:48,992 --> 01:03:51,326
LEONARDO DiCAPRIO.

1659
01:03:51,328 --> 01:03:51,826
>> YEAH.

1660
01:03:51,828 --> 01:03:53,561
I -- OH, MY GOD.

1661
01:03:53,563 --> 01:03:55,897
I REMEMBER YOU.

1662
01:03:55,899 --> 01:03:58,667

1663
01:03:58,669 --> 01:04:00,168
AND YOU KEPT SAYING I HAD

1664
01:04:00,170 --> 01:04:02,304
HUFFLEPUFF VIBES, BUT THE ASS OF

1665
01:04:02,306 --> 01:04:02,971
A SLYTHERIN.

1666
01:04:02,973 --> 01:04:03,571
>> YEAH.

1667
01:04:03,573 --> 01:04:05,674
THAT'S A HUGE COMPLIMENT.

1668
01:04:05,676 --> 01:04:07,509
>> LOOK, CAN YOU PLEASE JUST

1669
01:04:07,511 --> 01:04:07,876

1670
01:04:07,878 --> 01:04:08,543
>> FINE.

1671
01:04:08,545 --> 01:04:11,313
I'LL JUST GO TO THE BATHROOM,

1672
01:04:11,315 --> 01:04:12,447
AND WHEN I COME BACK, WE CAN

1673
01:04:12,449 --> 01:04:14,215
FIGURE ALL THIS OUT.

1674
01:04:14,217 --> 01:04:15,984
>> FIGURE WHAT OUT?

1675
01:04:15,986 --> 01:04:18,653
HOW DID YOU EVEN FIND OUT ABOUT

1676
01:04:18,655 --> 01:04:19,721
THIS WEDDING?

1677
01:04:19,723 --> 01:04:21,256

1678
01:04:21,258 --> 01:04:25,727
IS THE ORGANIST HERE?

1679
01:04:25,729 --> 01:04:27,529
GARRETT, I KNOW YOUR FEELINGS

1680
01:04:27,531 --> 01:04:29,364
ARE HURT, AND THAT'S REALLY

1681
01:04:29,366 --> 01:04:29,664
HARD.

1682
01:04:29,666 --> 01:04:30,498
BUT NO MATTER WHAT, YOU CANNOT

1683
01:04:30,500 --> 01:04:34,269
KILL THEM.

1684
01:04:34,271 --> 01:04:34,736
ALL RIGHT.

1685
01:04:34,738 --> 01:04:39,674
I THOUGHT ABOUT IT, YOU GUYS,

1686
01:04:39,676 --> 01:04:40,709
AND IT'S EITHER ME OR HIM.

1687
01:04:40,711 --> 01:04:42,410

>> THIS SUCKS.

1691
01:04:49,019 --> 01:04:49,384
WHATEVER.

1692
01:04:49,386 --> 01:04:51,453
I'M NOT EVEN ON HINGE ANYMORE.

1693
01:04:51,455 --> 01:04:54,456
NOT AFTER I GOT ACCEPTED TO

1694
01:04:54,458 --> 01:04:58,860
RAYA, AFTER I WENT VIRAL FOR

1695

1697
01:05:03,734 --> 01:05:05,600

1698
01:05:05,602 --> 01:05:07,168

1699
01:05:07,170 --> 01:05:07,569
HAPPENING.

1700
01:05:07,571 --> 01:05:10,271
>> IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT, BABE.

1701
01:05:10,273 --> 01:05:11,172

1705
01:05:16,847 --> 01:05:17,379

1712
01:05:25,489 --> 01:05:27,956
>> IT'S TIME FOR BED, STEWIE!

1713
01:05:27,958 --> 01:05:31,393
>> YOU VILE WOMAN.

1714
01:05:31,395 --> 01:05:33,061

1715
01:05:33,063 --> 01:05:35,697

1716
01:05:35,699 --> 01:05:37,766
BRIAN, YOU'RE BEING RIDICULOUS!

1717
01:05:37,768 --> 01:05:39,934
>> RIDICULOUS?

1718
01:05:39,936 --> 01:05:40,201
WOW.

1719
01:05:40,203 --> 01:05:42,470
NOW SHE'S GIVING HER MAN LIP ON

1720
01:05:42,472 --> 01:05:43,271
HIS WEDDING DAY.

1721
01:05:43,273 --> 01:05:46,908

I BROKE UP WITH YOUR SORRY ASS.

1724
01:05:50,580 --> 01:05:51,913
>> YOU KNOW WHAT, THIS IS

1725
01:05:51,915 --> 01:05:52,947
GETTING OUT OF CONTROL.

1726
01:05:52,949 --> 01:05:54,816
ME AND GARRETT ARE GOING TO GO

1727
01:05:54,818 --> 01:05:57,419

1728
01:05:57,421 --> 01:05:58,319

01:05:58,321 --> 01:05:58,653
>> WHAT?

1730
01:05:58,655 --> 01:06:02,157
BRIAN, NO!

>> I KNOW IT'S HARD, BRIAN.

1732
01:06:05,395 --> 01:06:07,662
I KNOW SHE HURT YOUR FEELINGS,

1733
01:06:07,664 --> 01:06:09,831
BUT NO MATTER WHAT, YOU CANNOT

1734
01:06:09,833 --> 01:06:10,231
KILL HER.

1735
01:06:10,233 --> 01:06:11,199
>> BUT I REALLY WANT TO.

1736
01:06:11,201 --> 01:06:12,267

1737
01:06:12,269 --> 01:06:14,169
IT'S SO TEMPTING.

1738
01:06:14,171 --> 01:06:17,272
WHY DID I BRING MY BOOK OF

1739
01:06:17,274 --> 01:06:17,605

1740
01:06:17,607 --> 01:06:19,240

I JUST NEED TO REMOVE MYSELF

1745
01:06:27,017 --> 01:06:27,549
FROM THE SITUATION.

1746
01:06:27,551 --> 01:06:31,886
GOOD-BYE, BRIAN.
