1
00:00:00,305 --> 00:00:03,812
>>> EASTER.
THE CELEBRATION OF THE RISEN
CHRIST.

2
00:00:03,812 --> 00:00:08,221
THE BIBLE TELLS US THAT JESUS
AND HIS DISCIPLES TRAVELED TO
THE CITY OF JERUSALEM.

3
00:00:08,221 --> 00:00:10,428
WHILE THERE, JESUS VISITED THE TEMPLE

4
00:00:10,428 --> 00:00:15,278
AND, ENRAGED UPON SEEING
MONEY CHANGERS TRANSACTING
BUSINESS WITHIN ITS SACRED WALLS,

5
00:00:15,278 --> 00:00:16,526
EXPELLED THEM ALL.

6
00:00:16,526 --> 00:00:20,113
JESUS WOULD BE ARRESTED AND
CRUCIFIED

7
00:00:20,113 --> 00:00:22,700
ONLY TO RISE AGAIN ON
THE THIRD DAY.

8
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:26,990
BUT IT BEGAN WITH THE CLEANSING
OF THE TEMPLE.

9
00:00:36,666 --> 00:00:38,892
>> WHAT IS THIS?

10
00:00:38,892 --> 00:00:42,209
WHAT TRANSPIRES IN THIS HOLY
PLACE?

11
00:00:42,209 --> 00:00:44,714
>> JESUS, WHAT ANGERS YOU?

12
00:00:44,714 --> 00:00:47,312
>> THIS SHOULD BE A HOUSE OF
PRAYER.

13
00:00:47,312 --> 00:00:49,864
THESE MERCHANTS AND MONEY CHANGERS

14
00:00:49,864 --> 00:00:53,313
HAVE TURNED IT INTO A
DEN OF THIEVES!

15
00:00:53,313 --> 00:00:56,369
>> OH, JESUS MAD.

16
00:00:56,369 --> 00:00:59,427
>> THIS WILL NOT STAND.

17
00:00:59,427 --> 00:01:04,083
I WILL RID THIS PLACE OF ALL ITS
MONEY!

18
00:01:05,803 --> 00:01:08,239
>> REMIND YOU OF ANYONE?

19
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:11,649
WOW, I ALSO GOT RID OF MONEY
LAST WEEK.

20
00:01:11,649 --> 00:01:15,213
BUT INSTEAD OF ONE TEMPLE, I DID
A WHOLE COUNTRY.

21
00:01:15,213 --> 00:01:17,893
MAYBE EVEN THE GLOBE.
THE MONEY'S GONE.

22
00:01:17,893 --> 00:01:21,891
HI, IT'S ME, YOUR FAVORITE
PRESIDENT, DONALD JESUS TRUMP.

23
00:01:21,891 --> 00:01:25,533
COMPARING MYSELF TO THE SON OF
GOD ONCE AGAIN.

24
00:01:25,533 --> 00:01:29,101
YOU KNOW, MANY PEOPLE ARE EVEN
CALLING ME THE MESSIAH

25
00:01:29,101 --> 00:01:32,795
BECAUSE
OF THE MESS I HAVE MADE OUT OF
THE ECONOMY.

26
00:01:32,795 --> 00:01:36,601
MY BEAUTIFUL TARIFFS, SO
BEAUTIFUL.

27
00:01:36,601 --> 00:01:40,253
THEY WERE WORKING SO WELL THAT I
HAD TO STOP THEM.

28
00:01:40,253 --> 00:01:43,273
THE PRIME MINISTER OF CANADA, BIG GUY,

29
00:01:43,273 --> 00:01:45,701
TEARS IN HIS EYES, HE
CALLED ME.

30
00:01:45,701 --> 00:01:49,558
AND HE SAID, "SIR, IF YOU DO
THIS, YOU WILL UPEND THE GLOBAL ECONOMY,

31
00:01:49,558 --> 00:01:53,212
TAKE THE STOCKS AND
BOND MARKETS, AND UNITE YOUR
ALLIES AGAINST YOU."

32
00:01:53,212 --> 00:01:55,251
AND I SAID, "LET ME COOK!"

33
00:01:55,251 --> 00:01:58,226
THEN I BURN DINNER BADLY.

34
00:01:58,226 --> 00:01:59,840
SO WE HAD TO STOP.

35
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,751
NOW EVERYTHING IS BACK EXACTLY
HOW IT WAS.

36
00:02:02,751 --> 00:02:04,927
MINUS A FEW TRILLION DOLLARS.

37
00:02:04,927 --> 00:02:09,991
AN HISTORIC TRANSFER OF WEALTH
FROM THE MIDDLE CLASS TO MY
BUDDIES, OH WELL.

38
00:02:09,991 --> 00:02:12,726
IT'S TRUE, THE STOCK MARKET DID
A JESUS.

39
00:02:12,726 --> 00:02:16,655
IT DIED.
THEN ON THE THIRD DAY, IT WAS
RISEN.

40
00:02:16,655 --> 00:02:18,810
THEN ON THE FOURTH DAY, IT DIED
AGAIN.

41
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:21,919
POSSIBLY NEVER TO RETURN, JUST
LIKE JESUS.

42
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:25,942
WHERE THE HECK IS THAT GUY?
COME BACK, GET ME OUT OF THIS.

43
00:02:25,942 --> 00:02:29,988
OH, AND JESUS CHRIST IS A NAME
WE'VE BEEN SAYING A LOT LATELY.

44
00:02:29,988 --> 00:02:31,428
WE'RE SAYING IT A LOT.

45
00:02:31,428 --> 00:02:36,396
WE LOOK AT OUR 401(k), JESUS
CHRIST, WHERE DID IT ALL GO?

46
00:02:36,396 --> 00:02:38,306
I DON'T KNOW, BUT WE'RE GOING TO FIX THAT,

47
00:02:38,306 --> 00:02:40,624
OR NOT, WE'LL SEE,
SHOULD BE INTERESTING.

48
00:02:40,624 --> 00:02:42,737
LOOK AT JESUS BACK THERE.

49
00:02:42,737 --> 00:02:47,040
FLIPPING THE TABLE LIKE A REAL
HOUSEWIFE.
TERESA.

50
00:02:48,568 --> 00:02:52,896
LOOK AT EMIL WAKIM, FEATURING
EMIL WAKIM!

51
00:02:52,896 --> 00:02:54,955
HE THINKS HE SHOULD BE PLAYING
JESUS.

52
00:02:54,955 --> 00:03:00,044
HE WAS TELLING EVERYBODY
BACKSTAGE, "THE REAL JESUS WOULD
HAVE LOOKED LIKE ME IRL."

53
00:03:00,044 --> 00:03:03,407
BUT WE DON'T LIKE TO THINK ABOUT
THAT, WE HAVE MIKEY DAY THERE.

54
00:03:03,407 --> 00:03:07,098
WITH HIS BIG, BEAUTIFUL BLUE
EYES.

55
00:03:07,098 --> 00:03:12,805
HE'S LIKE, OH, NO, WAIT, MY
GREAT CLIPS MONEY, I NEED MY
GREAT CLIPS MONEY.

56
00:03:14,911 --> 00:03:17,921
BUT IT'S ALMOST TIME FOR EASTER.

57
00:03:17,921 --> 00:03:21,559
A HOLIDAY THAT IS SO SPECIAL,
AND FRANKLY UPCOMING TO ME.

58
00:03:21,559 --> 00:03:25,633
AND TODAY IS THE FIRST DAY OF
PASSOVER FOR OUR JEWISH FRIENDS.

59
00:03:25,633 --> 00:03:27,065
WE CALL IT PASSOVER.

60
00:03:27,065 --> 00:03:31,264
BECAUSE IT'S WHEN I ABOUT PASS
OVER THE KOSHER SECTION IN THE
GROCERY STORE,

61
00:03:31,264 --> 00:03:33,701
GO STRAIGHT TO
THAT EASTER CANDY.

62
00:03:33,701 --> 00:03:37,689
ENVISION A JAR.
NO, THANKS, WASN'T A PEEP.

63
00:03:37,689 --> 00:03:41,812
WE LOVE EASTER, WE LOVE BUNNY,
WE LOVE HUNTING FOR EGGS

64
00:03:41,812 --> 00:03:45,091
JUST
LIKE EVERYONE'S DOING IN THE
GROCERY STORE RIGHT NOW.

65
00:03:45,091 --> 00:03:49,263
BECAUSE THEY COST A TRILLION
BILLION DOLLARS, PRICE OF EGGS.

66
00:03:49,263 --> 00:03:52,011
I THOUGHT THAT WAS WHAT THE
WHOLE CAMPAIGN WAS ABOUT.

67
00:03:52,011 --> 00:03:55,236
BUT I JUST CAN'T CRACK AN EGG
JOKE, HERE WE GO.

68
00:03:55,236 --> 00:03:57,607
THAT'S ACTUALLY KIND OF
CREATIVE.

69
00:03:57,607 --> 00:03:59,951
BUT WE LOVE EASTER.

70
00:03:59,951 --> 00:04:05,413
IT'S THE DAY WHERE THE MOST
HOMOPHOBIC PEOPLE TRY TO DRESS
AS GAY AS POSSIBLE.

71
00:04:05,413 --> 00:04:07,984
"DARLING, HAVE YOU SEEN MY"
BONNET?

72
00:04:07,984 --> 00:04:11,437
DADDY LOOKS LOVELY IN HIS PINK
SEERSUCKER.

73
00:04:11,437 --> 00:04:14,730
WE ARE LOOKING FORWARD TO EASTER
MASS.

74
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:17,809
EASTER MASS IS ALWAYS PACKED.
IT'S SAD.

75
00:04:17,809 --> 00:04:21,013
SOME PEOPLE ONLY GO TO CHURCH ON
CHRISTMAS AND EASTER.

76
00:04:21,013 --> 00:04:24,604
NOT ME.
I DON'T GO ON THOSE DAYS EITHER.

77
00:04:24,604 --> 00:04:27,052
BUT I LOVE TO PRAY.
I PRAY A LOT.

78
00:04:27,052 --> 00:04:30,435
I PRAY SO MUCH, THEY CALL ME
PREDATOR.

79
00:04:30,435 --> 00:04:33,796
LOOK AT ALL THEM, LOOK AT SARAH
SHERMAN.

80
00:04:33,796 --> 00:04:37,657
STUCK WITH HER MOUTH OPEN.
BAD CHOICE.

81
00:04:38,731 --> 00:04:42,697
KENAN'S BACK THERE TOO.
I LOVE KENAN.

82
00:04:44,216 --> 00:04:46,703
>> YEAH, I'M LEAVING.

83
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:49,775
>> WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
YOU CAN'T GO, KENAN.

84
00:04:49,775 --> 00:04:51,527
>> YEAH, I CAN.

85
00:04:51,527 --> 00:04:54,563
>> OKAY, I GUESS IT'S KENAN, SO
HE CAN GO.

86
00:04:54,737 --> 00:04:57,879
THINKING ABOUT IT, SHE WANTS TO --

87
00:04:57,879 --> 00:05:01,545
OH, SHE'S THINKING ABOUT
WALKING.
DO I HAVE THE JUICE TO SCOOT?

88
00:05:01,545 --> 00:05:05,242
I DON'T KNOW.
SHE HAD A BIG HIT LAST WEEK,
MISS EGGY.

89
00:05:05,242 --> 00:05:07,176
THIS IS NOT GOING TO DO.

90
00:05:07,176 --> 00:05:12,111
DON'T SAY IT, WE'LL GET IN
TROUBLE.

91
00:05:12,111 --> 00:05:15,031
ANYWAY, WHAT ELSE I GOT, WHAT
ELSE I GOT?

92
00:05:15,031 --> 00:05:17,602
I HAD MY ANNUAL PHYSICAL THIS
WEEK.

93
00:05:17,602 --> 00:05:19,665
THEY SAID I'M IN GREAT SHAPE.

94
00:05:19,665 --> 00:05:22,972
ONE OF THE BEST SHAPES.
LUMP.

95
00:05:22,972 --> 00:05:27,277
SO, IN CONCLUSION, THE U.S.
DOLLAR HAS DIED

96
00:05:27,277 --> 00:05:29,759
AND GONE TO
MONEY HEAVEN, BYE-BYE.

97
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:32,974
SOME PEOPLE SAY I DON'T KNOW
WHAT IMDOING, BUT I ACTUALLY --

98
00:05:32,974 --> 00:05:38,038
I'M PLAYING FOUR-DIMENSIONAL
CHESS, OKAY?

99
00:05:38,038 --> 00:05:39,494
KING ME!

100
00:05:39,494 --> 00:05:42,595
BUT IN THE HOLIEST OF SEASONS, EASTER,

101
00:05:42,595 --> 00:05:45,279
LET US REMEMBER THE
LESSON THAT MR. JESUS TAUGHT US

102
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:48,298
WHEN HE WENT BUCK WILD ON THOSE
MONEY CHANGERS.

103
00:05:48,298 --> 00:05:51,502
WE MUST NEVER MIX RELIGION WITH
COMMERCE.

104
00:05:51,502 --> 00:05:54,907
YOU CAN READ ALL ABOUT THIS IN
MY TRUMP BIBLE.

105
00:05:54,907 --> 00:05:57,865
NOW MADE IN AMERICA, SO IT COSTS
$1,300.

106
00:05:57,865 --> 00:06:00,945
AND IT FALLS APART EVEN FASTER.

107
00:06:00,945 --> 00:06:04,438
ALL RIGHT.
SHOULD I LET THEM SAY IT WITH ME
THIS TIME?
I THINK I WILL.

108
00:06:04,438 --> 00:06:06,433
HAPPY EASTER, HAPPY PASSOVER,

109
00:06:06,433 --> 00:06:10,701
AND -- LIVE FROM NEW YORK, IT'S
SATURDAY NIGHT!

110
00:08:30,275 --> 00:08:36,081
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, JON HAMM!

111
00:08:55,459 --> 00:08:59,757
THANK YOU, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

112
00:08:59,757 --> 00:09:03,294
SPRINGTIME IN NEW YORK CITY,
HUH?

113
00:09:03,294 --> 00:09:06,606
41 DEGREES AND DAMP.

114
00:09:06,606 --> 00:09:10,029
OH, MAN.
I AM SO HONORED TO BE BACK HERE
HOSTING.

115
00:09:10,029 --> 00:09:12,715
THIS IS MY FOURTH TIME.

116
00:09:14,209 --> 00:09:16,913
BUT -- BEEN A MINUTE.

117
00:09:16,913 --> 00:09:20,604
LAST TIME I HOSTED WAS OCTOBER
2010.

118
00:09:20,604 --> 00:09:24,442
BUT EVEN THOUGH IT'S BEEN
AWHILE, I'VE STILL BEEN ON THE
SHOW A LOT.

119
00:09:24,442 --> 00:09:27,279
IN FACT, I WAS CHECKING MY OWN
WIKIPEDIA.

120
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:29,755
WHICH I OFTEN DO.

121
00:09:29,755 --> 00:09:35,149
AND I FOUND OUT THAT SINCE THEN,
I'VE MADE 14 CAMEOS.

122
00:09:37,505 --> 00:09:40,487
AND YOU KNOW, MAKING A CAMEO

123
00:09:40,487 --> 00:09:43,068
IS EVEN MORE SPECIAL THAN BEING THE
HOST.

124
00:09:43,068 --> 00:09:46,211
WHICH IS SOMETHING LORNE'S TOLD
ME MANY TIMES.

125
00:09:46,211 --> 00:09:49,582
ALWAYS RIGHT BEFORE HE LOSES
SERVICE GOING INTO THE TUNNEL.

126
00:09:49,582 --> 00:09:52,371
HE'S ALWAYS IN THAT TUNNEL.

127
00:09:52,371 --> 00:09:54,555
BUT YEAH, 14 CAMEOS.

128
00:09:54,555 --> 00:09:56,710
LET'S TAKE A LOOK.

129
00:09:59,924 --> 00:10:01,685
OKAY.

130
00:10:01,685 --> 00:10:05,742
I KIND OF MAYBE THOUGHT THEY'D
BE PLAYED SEPARATELY.
THAT'S A LITTLE WEIRD.

131
00:10:05,742 --> 00:10:09,015
REALLY, ANY TIME THEY CALL ME TO
COME ON THE SHOW, I DO IT.

132
00:10:09,015 --> 00:10:12,201
BECAUSE NOTHING BEATS THAT
MOMENT WHEN YOU WALK OUT UNEXPECTEDLY

133
00:10:12,201 --> 00:10:13,989
AND THE AUDIENCE
JUST GOES WILD.

134
00:10:13,989 --> 00:10:14,919
CHECK IT OUT.

135
00:10:14,919 --> 00:10:17,092
>> HEY, BUDDY.

136
00:10:23,213 --> 00:10:24,783
>> AMAZING.

137
00:10:24,783 --> 00:10:28,120
I MEAN, RIGHT?
I LOVE WATCHING MYSELF.

138
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:32,314
AND THE BEST PART IS, I KNOW
THAT ONCE THE AUDIENCE DIES
DOWN, THE APPLAUSE DIES DOWN,

139
00:10:32,314 --> 00:10:36,002
THE WRITERS HAVE WRITTEN ME A
JOKE THAT WILL ELECTRIFY THE
CROWD.

140
00:10:36,002 --> 00:10:38,000
>> I DON'T JUST KISS AND TELL.

141
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,025
I KISS AND TELL, AND I TAKE
NOTES.

142
00:10:43,014 --> 00:10:45,033
>> EXCEPT FOR THAT TIME.

143
00:10:45,033 --> 00:10:47,414
EXCEPT FOR THAT AND A BUNCH OF
OTHER TIMES, I KNOW.

144
00:10:47,414 --> 00:10:51,138
BUT LOOK, I KNOW A CAMEO MAY
SEEM INCONSEQUENTIAL.

145
00:10:51,138 --> 00:10:53,253
BUT IT REALLY IS AN IMPORTANT
PART OF THE SHOW.

146
00:10:53,253 --> 00:10:57,812
LIKE WHEN A SKETCH NEEDS THAT
LITTLE SOMETHING EXTRA TO TAKE
IT FROM A MEDIUM SKETCH

147
00:10:57,812 --> 00:11:00,294
TO A
MARGINALLY BETTER THAN A MEDIUM SKETCH

148
00:11:00,294 --> 00:11:05,298
OR WHEN A MONOLOGUE IS
FEELING AIMLESS AND IT NEEDS A
JOLT OF ENERGY.

149
00:11:05,298 --> 00:11:08,189

00:17:09,533 --> 00:17:09,865
BYE-BYE!

316
00:17:19,099 --> 00:17:20,658
MISSING

317
00:17:20,658 --> 00:17:23,812
AVA 22

318
00:17:23,939 --> 00:17:25,567
DIDN'T SHOW UP FOR WORK TODAY

319
00:17:25,567 --> 00:17:28,029
AND HER ROOMMATES SAY SHE DIDN'T
COME HOME LAST NIGHT.

320
00:17:28,029 --> 00:17:31,651
>> ANY RELATION TO COUNCILMAN
CLARKSON?

321
00:17:31,651 --> 00:17:34,280
>> HIS SISTER'S KID.
>> JESUS CHRIST.

322
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:37,408
>> YEAH.
CITY HALL'S BREATHING DOWN MY
NECK.

323
00:17:37,408 --> 00:17:40,824
WE NEED ALL HANDS ON DECK.
REVIEWING SURVEILLANCE.

324
00:17:40,824 --> 00:17:43,188
CALLING CO-WORKERS, NEIGHBORS,
EVERYONE.

325
00:17:43,188 --> 00:17:47,281
GOING TO BE A LATE ONE, SO ORDER
SOME PIZZAS AND

326
00:17:47,418 --> 00:17:49,117
LET'S FIND THAT
GIRL.

327
00:17:49,117 --> 00:17:52,578
>> PIZZA!
YES!

328
00:17:52,954 --> 00:17:54,924
PIZZA!

329
00:17:54,924 --> 00:17:56,034
>> CRAIG.

330
00:17:56,034 --> 00:17:58,063
>> AWESOME SAUCE.

331
00:17:58,063 --> 00:18:01,814
>> I'M SURE YOU'VE NOTICED, WE
HAVE FRIENDS FROM THE BUREAU
JOINING US TODAY.

332
00:18:01,814 --> 00:18:04,625
AGENT MURPHY, DO YOU WANT TO
COME UP HERE?
>> THANKS, CHIEF.

333
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:09,371
YEAH, THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF
MISINFORMATION CIRCLING ABOUT
THIS CASE ON SOCIAL MEDIA.

334
00:18:09,371 --> 00:18:11,160
I'D LIKE TO OPEN IT UP TO
QUESTIONS.

335
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,880
>> WHAT TOPPINGS Y'ALL THINKING
ABOUT?

336
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:13,883
HEY

337
00:18:13,883 --> 00:18:16,332
PEPPER RENO.
>> WHO SAID THAT?

338
00:18:16,332 --> 00:18:18,955
>> DANIELS.
ENOUGH ABOUT THE PIZZA.

339
00:18:18,955 --> 00:18:20,203
YOU'RE ACTING LIKE A LITTLE KID.

340
00:18:20,203 --> 00:18:22,219
>> SORRY, CHIEF.

341
00:18:22,481 --> 00:18:24,301
NOT A LITTLE KID.

342
00:18:24,301 --> 00:18:27,114
>> NOW, AVA WAS LAST SEEN AT
WORK SUNDAY NIGHT.

343
00:18:27,114 --> 00:18:31,377
A GARBAGE MAN PLACES HER ON
DREIGHTON AROUND 7:00 P.M.

344
00:18:31,378 --> 00:18:32,214
BLOCKS

345
00:18:32,214 --> 00:18:34,279
>> I DON'T WANT PIZZA ANYMORE.
>> ARE YOU CRYING?

346
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:37,780
>> I'M NOT GOING TO EAT PIZZA
EVEN THOUGH IT'S MY BIRTHDAY.

347
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:41,057
>> NO, IT'S NOT, YOU JUST HAD
YOUR 50th AT DAVE & BUSTER'S.

348
00:18:41,057 --> 00:18:43,814
>> DUDE, CHILL, NOT EVERYONE WAS
INVITED.

349
00:18:43,814 --> 00:18:45,556
>> IT'S FINE YOU DIDN'T INVITE
ME, DANIELS.

350
00:18:45,556 --> 00:18:47,562
>> I DON'T DESERVE PIZZA.

351
00:18:47,562 --> 00:18:52,036
MAYBE I'LL HAVE A SODA AND
THAT'S ALL I'LL HAVE FROM THE
PIZZA PARTY.

352
00:18:52,036 --> 00:18:53,368
>> IT'S NOT A PIZZA PARTY.

353
00:18:53,368 --> 00:18:55,836
>> I'M LOST, CAN WE START OVER?

354
00:18:55,836 --> 00:18:58,242
FOCUS UP AND TRY TO FIND THIS
DOG.

355
00:18:58,242 --> 00:19:00,004
>> IT'S A MISSING GIRL!

356
00:19:00,004 --> 00:19:02,305
>> WHATEVER.
OH, MY GOD IS SHE OKAY?

357
00:19:02,305 --> 00:19:04,239
>> WE DON'T KNOW,
- THAT'S WHAT THIS IS.

358
00:19:04,239 --> 00:19:06,767
>> WHY ARE WE SITTING AROUND
HERE AND HAVING A SLEEPOVER?

359
00:19:06,767 --> 00:19:09,784
>> THIS ISN'T A SLEEPOVER, THIS
IS MAN.
WORK

360
00:19:09,784 --> 00:19:14,055
I ORDERED PIZZAS TO BE NICE.
THREE CHEESE, THREE HAWAIIAN.

361
00:19:14,055 --> 00:19:15,735
>> OH, MY GOD, ARE YOU KIDDING
ME?

362
00:19:15,735 --> 00:19:18,629
>> YOU GOT HALF HAWAIIAN?

363
00:19:18,629 --> 00:19:19,868
YOU JUST MADE THAT CALL?

364
00:19:19,868 --> 00:19:22,806
HAND
>> [ BLEEP ] HAWAIIAN.

365
00:19:22,806 --> 00:19:23,923
>> I LOVE HAWAIIAN.

366
00:19:23,923 --> 00:19:27,723
>> JUST FOR YOU?
IT'S FOR EVERYBODY.

367
00:19:27,723 --> 00:19:31,109
>> LOOK AT WHAT YOU'RE DOING.
HE'S GROWLING LIKE A DOG.

368
00:19:31,109 --> 00:19:34,561
>> LIKE WE SAY AT QUANTICO, IT
AIN'T A SLEEPOVER WITHOUT MEAT
LOVERS, Y'ALL.

369
00:19:34,561 --> 00:19:36,873
>> THANK YOU!

370
00:19:37,692 --> 00:19:42,466
>> HEY.
I REALIZED IMMEDIATELY I
SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE THAT.

371
00:19:42,466 --> 00:19:44,495
>> PIZZA!

372
00:19:44,495 --> 00:19:47,107
>> IT'S THE VICTIM'S MOTHER.

373
00:19:47,379 --> 00:19:48,802
>> UGH, GREAT.

374
00:19:48,802 --> 00:19:52,575
>> MA'AM, I'M SO DEEPLY SORRY
ABOUT EVERYTHING.

375
00:19:52,575 --> 00:19:55,419
>> I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.
MY WHOLE WORLD IS UPSIDE DOWN.

376
00:19:55,419 --> 00:19:57,644
>> I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE
GOING THROUGH.

377
00:19:57,644 --> 00:20:00,434
WHEN I WAS YOUNG, I HAD A DOG
RUN AWAY TOO.

378
00:20:00,434 --> 00:20:01,373
>> DOG?

379
00:20:01,373 --> 00:20:04,718
>> DANIELS, PLEASE, FOCUS ON
FINDING THE MISSING GIRL.

380
00:20:04,718 --> 00:20:06,388
WE'RE NEVER GOING TO FIND HER IF
WE --

381
00:20:06,388 --> 00:20:07,615
>> HELLO?

382
00:20:08,861 --> 00:20:12,093
>> OH, MY GOD.

383
00:20:12,093 --> 00:20:14,116
>> I GOT YOUR PIZZA.

384
00:20:13,912 --> 00:20:15,673
>> PIZZA!

385
00:20:15,673 --> 00:20:17,902
>> IT'S HAWAIIAN, RIGHT?

386
00:20:51,984 --> 00:20:59,924
>> "GUESS THE CORRECT ANSWER!"

387
00:20:59,926 --> 00:21:01,859
>> HELLO AND GOOD EVENING.

388
00:21:01,861 --> 00:21:04,428
I'M MARKY MARK BRANDON MARCUS,

389
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:06,197
AND WELCOME BACK TO "GUESS THE

390
00:21:06,199 --> 00:21:07,131
CORRECT ANSWER."

391
00:21:07,133 --> 00:21:09,967
NOT A HUGE FAN OF THE TITLE,

392
00:21:09,969 --> 00:21:10,301
MYSELF.

393
00:21:10,303 --> 00:21:12,136
BUT THE FOCUS GROUP CALLED IT

394
00:21:12,138 --> 00:21:13,137
FINE FOR NOW.

395
00:21:13,539 --> 00:21:18,009
LET'S MEET OUR TWO TEAMS.

396
00:21:18,011 --> 00:21:20,077

397
00:21:20,079 --> 00:21:21,746

QUEENS, PETER McGRAPH.

399
00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:24,682
>> EXCITED TO BE HERE.

400
00:21:24,684 --> 00:21:26,217
>> LET'S GET THIS PARTY STARTED.

401
00:21:26,219 --> 00:21:29,286
>> FROM MAPLE WOOD, NEW JERSEY,

402
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:30,321
DAMIAN DRIVER.

FROM BURLINGTON, PAUL McCROSKEY.

404
00:21:32,525 --> 00:21:34,191
HOW ARE YOU GUYS FEELING?

405
00:21:34,193 --> 00:21:35,159
>> PUMPED TO BE HERE.

406
00:21:35,161 --> 00:21:36,694
>> PRETTY NERVOUS, NOT GOING TO

407
00:21:36,696 --> 00:21:36,994
LIE.

408
00:21:36,996 --> 00:21:38,429
>> OH, WHY'S THAT, PAUL?

409
00:21:38,431 --> 00:21:39,296
>> OH, GEEZ.

410
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:40,164
I DON'T KNOW.

411
00:21:40,166 --> 00:21:41,232
I JUST HAVE A GREAT LIFE.

412
00:21:41,234 --> 00:21:42,633
AND I'M AFRAID I COULD DO

413
00:21:42,635 --> 00:21:43,901
SOMETHING EMBARRASSING THAT

414
00:21:43,903 --> 00:21:44,635
COULD GO VIRAL AND RUIN IT ALL.

415
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:49,173
>> OH.

416
00:21:49,175 --> 00:21:49,473
WELL.

417
00:21:49,475 --> 00:21:50,307
DON'T THINK LIKE THAT, YOU'RE

418
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:50,975
GOING TO DO GREAT.

419
00:21:50,977 --> 00:21:52,143
>> I HOPE SO.

420
00:21:52,145 --> 00:21:52,910
I REALLY HOPE SO.

421
00:21:52,912 --> 00:21:54,845
I GOT A GREAT FAMILY, BEAUTIFUL

422
00:21:54,847 --> 00:21:56,313
WIFE, I'M A DENTIST.

423
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:57,682
WELL LIKED IN MY COMMUNITY.

424
00:21:57,684 --> 00:21:59,483
I DON'T REALLY NEED THE MONEY.

425
00:21:59,485 --> 00:22:00,251
NOT MUCH TO GAIN AND A WHOLE LOT

426
00:22:00,253 --> 00:22:01,519
TO LOSE.

427
00:22:01,521 --> 00:22:05,156
>> DAMN.

428
00:22:05,158 --> 00:22:05,756
WELL, HOPE IT GOES WELL.

429
00:22:05,758 --> 00:22:08,793
LET'S PLAY.

430
00:22:08,795 --> 00:22:09,760
WE'LL START WITH YOU TWO.

431
00:22:09,762 --> 00:22:11,095
THE RULES OF THE GAME ARE

432
00:22:11,097 --> 00:22:11,796
SIMPLE.

433
00:22:11,798 --> 00:22:13,164
DAMIAN, YOUR JOB IS TO GET PAUL

434
00:22:13,166 --> 00:22:15,099
TO GUESS WHAT'S ON THE CARD IN

435
00:22:15,101 --> 00:22:15,733
FRONT OF YOU.

436
00:22:15,735 --> 00:22:17,168
YOUR CATEGORY IS, THINGS YOU

437
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:18,302
MIGHT FIND IN A WORKPLACE.

438
00:22:18,304 --> 00:22:20,171
>> OH, NICE, NICE, NICE.

439
00:22:20,173 --> 00:22:21,005
RIGHT UP MY ALLEY.

440
00:22:21,007 --> 00:22:22,940
I WORK IN A WORKPLACE.

441
00:22:22,942 --> 00:22:23,374
>> VERY GOOD.

442
00:22:23,376 --> 00:22:25,076
>> YEAH.

443
00:22:25,078 --> 00:22:26,143
I THINK THAT WAS -- TOTALLY

444
00:22:26,145 --> 00:22:27,511
WRONG BEFORE, I THINK IT'S GOING

445
00:22:27,513 --> 00:22:28,045
TO BE FINE.

446
00:22:28,047 --> 00:22:28,746
>> EXCELLENT.

447
00:22:28,748 --> 00:22:29,313
YOUR TIME STARTS NOW.

448
00:22:29,315 --> 00:22:31,315
>> OKAY.

449
00:22:31,317 --> 00:22:31,949
SOMETHING THAT'S RACIST.

450
00:22:31,951 --> 00:22:34,919
>> OH -- ME.

451
00:22:38,224 --> 00:22:39,023
>> WHAT?

452
00:22:39,025 --> 00:22:40,791
>> ME, MYSELF, MY FAMILY, MY

453
00:22:40,793 --> 00:22:41,492
WHOLE FAMILY.

454
00:22:41,494 --> 00:22:41,892
>> NO.

455
00:22:41,894 --> 00:22:43,728
>> MY FRIENDS, MY BEST FRIEND,

456
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:48,399
MY GROOMSMAN, MY JOKES, MY FUNNY

457
00:22:48,401 --> 00:22:49,233
ACCENTS, MY LOOKS --

458
00:22:49,235 --> 00:22:50,067
>> YOU'RE DOING EXACTLY WHAT YOU

459
00:22:50,069 --> 00:22:51,669
WERE WORRIED ABOUT.

460
00:22:51,671 --> 00:22:52,703
COME ON, MAN.

461
00:22:52,705 --> 00:22:53,471
IT'S SOMETHING SMALL.

462
00:22:53,473 --> 00:22:55,773
>> MY PENIS.

463
00:22:56,175 --> 00:22:56,741
>> SMALL BUT RACIST.

464
00:22:56,743 --> 00:22:58,375
>> YEAH, MY PENIS.

465
00:22:58,377 --> 00:22:58,776
>> NO, MAN.

466
00:22:58,778 --> 00:23:02,012
PASS, PASS.

467
00:23:02,014 --> 00:23:02,780
OH, OKAY.

468
00:23:02,782 --> 00:23:03,914
WHAT YOU DRINK FIRST THING IN

469
00:23:03,916 --> 00:23:04,448
THE MORNING.

470
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:05,583
>> VODKA.

471
00:23:05,985 --> 00:23:07,351
>> WHAT YOU DRINK BEFORE WORK.

472
00:23:07,353 --> 00:23:09,120
>> VODKA.

473
00:23:09,522 --> 00:23:11,589
>> DON'T TALK TO ME BEFORE I'VE

474
00:23:11,591 --> 00:23:12,656
HAD MY --

475
00:23:12,658 --> 00:23:13,624
>> VEST COPY.

476
00:23:13,626 --> 00:23:13,958

COLIN JOST AND MICHAEL CHE.

00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:13,381
>> THANK YOU.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
GOOD EVENING, EVERYONE.

735
00:35:13,381 --> 00:35:17,309
>> WELCOME TO "WEEKEND UPDATE."
I'M MICHAEL CHE.
>> I'M COLIN JOST.

736
00:35:17,550 --> 00:35:23,296
PRESIDENT TRUMP TRIED TO RESCUE
THE ECONOMY FROM THE DISASTROUS POLICIES

737
00:35:23,296 --> 00:35:26,189
OF WHOEVER WAS
PRESIDENT LAST WEEK.

738
00:35:26,189 --> 00:35:30,683
ON WEDNESDAY, TRUMP ANNOUNCED HE
WAS PAUSING MOST TARIFFS FOR 90
DAYS.

739
00:35:30,683 --> 00:35:33,309
NOW, 90 DAYS MAY NOT SEEM LIKE A LONG TIME,

740
00:35:33,309 --> 00:35:37,156
BUT REMEMBER, TRUMP
HAS ONLY BEEN PRESIDENT FOR 82
DAYS.

741
00:35:37,156 --> 00:35:41,019
AND IT ALREADY FEELS LIKE A
GODDAMN DECADE.

742
00:35:41,019 --> 00:35:44,571
JUST HOURS BEFORE, TRUMP PAUSED
THE TARIFFS.

743
00:35:44,571 --> 00:35:46,911
HE TRIED TO CALM INVESTORS BY POSTING,

744
00:35:46,911 --> 00:35:51,603
"BE COOL, EVERYTHING IS
GOING TO WORK OUT WELL."

745
00:35:51,603 --> 00:35:54,723
BE COOL?
THIS IS A GLOBAL ECONOMY.

746
00:35:54,723 --> 00:35:59,702
IT'S NOT LIKE WE GOT TOO HIGH
AND WE'RE TRYING TO GET THROUGH
DINNER WITH OUR PARENTS.

747
00:36:01,041 --> 00:36:05,169
>>> THE CEOs OF MANY TECH
COMPANIES WHO SUPPORTED
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN

748
00:36:05,169 --> 00:36:08,072
HAVE
SAID THEY WERE SURPRISED BY ALL
OF HIS TARIFFS.

749
00:36:08,072 --> 00:36:10,720
WELL, YEAH.
I MEAN, HE HARDLY EVER MENTIONED
THEM.

750
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:13,900
>> WE'RE GOING TO HAVE SO MUCH
MONEY COMING IN FROM TARIFFS.

751
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:16,938
- TARIFFS ON PHARMACEUTICALS
- ON STEEL.
- CAR TARIFFS.

752
00:36:16,938 --> 00:36:20,087
- HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS IN TARIFFS.
- SUBSTANTIAL TARIFFS.

753
00:36:20,087 --> 00:36:22,802
10%.
25% TARIFFS.

754
00:36:22,802 --> 00:36:24,636
50% TARIFFS.
BIG TARIFFS.

755
00:36:24,636 --> 00:36:27,891
TARIFFS.
TARIFFS.
TARIFFS.

756
00:36:27,891 --> 00:36:29,820
I LOVE TARIFFS.

757
00:36:30,097 --> 00:36:34,545
>> IT'S LIKE LISTENING TO BUBBA
GUMP TALK ABOUT SHRIMP.

758
00:36:35,563 --> 00:36:38,269
>> TRUMP RESPONDED TO THE
FALLOUT FROM HIS TARIFFS

759
00:36:38,269 --> 00:36:41,288
SAYING
SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO TAKE
MEDICINE TO FIX SOMETHING.

760
00:36:41,288 --> 00:36:44,926
YEAH, BUT THIS FEELS LIKE WE
TOOK A WHOLE BOTTLE OF MEDICINE
WITH A GLASS OF VODKA

761
00:36:44,926 --> 00:36:47,140
AND LAID
IN A WARM BATH.

762
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:51,161
IT WAS REPORTED ELON MUSK
PERSONALLY APPEALED TO PRESIDENT TRUMP

763
00:36:51,161 --> 00:36:53,315
TO STOP HIS TARIFF PLAN,
AND IT WORKED.

764
00:36:53,315 --> 00:36:56,205
THE STOCK MARKET WENT UP LIKE
THIS.

765
00:37:00,390 --> 00:37:04,106
>>> CHINA'S RETALIATORY TARIFFS
WILL HURT U.S. FARMERS,

766
00:37:04,106 --> 00:37:08,614
WHO SELL
PRODUCTS TO CHINA THEY CAN'T
SELL ELSEWHERE, INCLUDING CHICKEN FEET,

767
00:37:08,614 --> 00:37:13,564
WHICH MEANS THOSE CHICKENS
WILL HAVE TO SELL THEIR FEET ON
ONLYFANS.

768
00:37:14,821 --> 00:37:18,972
>>> A NEW REPORT SHOWS THAT IF
iPHONES WERE MANUFACTURED IN THE U.S.,

769
00:37:18,972 --> 00:37:21,769
THEY COULD COST UP TO
$3,500.

770
00:37:21,769 --> 00:37:23,246
WHICH IS A LOT, BUT REMEMBER,

771
00:37:23,246 --> 00:37:26,313
YOUR KIDS WOULD GET AN EMPLOYEE
DISCOUNT.

772
00:37:30,066 --> 00:37:33,771
>>> THE U.S. EDUCATION
DEPARTMENT HAS LAUNCHED A WEBSITE

773
00:37:33,771 --> 00:37:38,340
IN WHICH STUDENTS CAN
REPORT PUBLIC SCHOOLTEACHERS WHO
VIOLATE ANTI-DEI RULES.

774
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:42,293
REMEMBER, TEACHERS, YOU'VE GOT
TO SLEEP WITH THE WHITE ONES
TOO.

775
00:37:47,554 --> 00:37:50,459
>>> HEALTH SECRETARY ROBERT FMT KENNEDY JR.,

776
00:37:50,459 --> 00:37:56,075

ROUTINE INVOLVES ROLLING AROUND
UNDER 7-ELEVEN HOT DOG LAMPS --

777
00:37:56,415 --> 00:38:00,029
SAID HE PLANS TO TELL THE CDC TO
STOP RECOMMENDING

778
00:38:00,029 --> 00:38:02,242
THAT FLUORIDE
BE PUT IN DRINKING WATER

779
00:38:02,242 --> 00:38:05,987
AND
START RECOMMENDING VENEERS FOR
KIDS.

780
00:38:08,674 --> 00:38:14,554
>>> IT WAS REPORTED THAT SEVERAL
WHITE HOUSE OFFICIALS ARE
REFUSING TO ANSWER MESSAGES FROM JOURNALISTS

781
00:38:14,554 --> 00:38:18,200
IF THEIR EMAIL
SIGNATURES INCLUDE IDENTIFYING
PRONOUNS.

782
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:21,580
WHICH IS EXTREMELY FRUSTRATING
FOR "NEW YORK TIMES" REPORTER

783
00:38:21,580 --> 00:38:23,858
SHEHERTHEYTHEM.

784

>>> THIS WEEK, PRESIDENT TRUMP

785
00:38:26,962 --> 00:38:29,029
PAUSED HIS TARIFFS ON MOST

786
00:38:29,031 --> 00:38:30,330
COUNTRIES EXCEPT CHINA, RAISING

787
00:38:30,332 --> 00:38:33,400
THEM TO 145% AS THE TRADE WAR

788

ESCALATES.

MINISTER CHEN BIAO.

791
00:38:41,677 --> 00:38:44,711
>> GOOD TO BE HERE, CHE.

792
00:38:44,713 --> 00:38:46,079
>> ARE YOU READY TO COME TO THE

793

NEGOTIATING TABLE FOR A TRADE

794

DEAL?

795
00:38:47,649 --> 00:38:49,249
>> HM, NOT YET.

796
00:38:49,251 --> 00:38:51,218
I'VE JUST BEEN REALLY ENJOYING

797

FRANKLY.

933
00:44:34,089 --> 00:44:38,848
THERE'S NO OTHER WAY TO PUT IT.

THAT NONE OF US WOULD
HAVE OWNED SLAVES.

1272
00:59:52,757 --> 00:59:55,431
KAYAKING WITH YOUR SIGNIFICANT
OTHER.

1273
00:59:55,431 --> 00:59:58,575
HIKING WITH YOUR INTERRACIAL
FRIENDS.

1274
00:59:58,783 --> 01:00:02,477
IF YOU FIND YOURSELF DOING ANY
OF THESE ACTIVITIES IN SLOW MOTION,

1275
01:00:02,477 --> 01:00:04,948
YOU MAY HAVE HERPES.

1276
01:00:04,948 --> 01:00:07,300
AS WE'VE LEARNED FROM VALTREX
COMMERCIALS,

1277
01:00:07,300 --> 01:00:11,710
THESE RECREATIONAL
ACTIVITIES ARE THE NUMBER ONE
INDICATORS OF HERPES INFECTION.

1278
01:00:11,710 --> 01:00:14,572
MEDICAL SCIENCE DOESN'T
UNDERSTAND WHY THE HERPES VIRUS

1279
01:00:14,572 --> 01:00:17,428
CAUSES PEOPLE TO SEEK ACTIVE FUN IN SLOW MOTION,

1280
01:00:17,428 --> 01:00:19,098
BUT WE KNOW THAT
IT DOES.

1281
01:00:19,098 --> 01:00:21,078
AND THAT MEANS IT'S TIME TO GET
TESTED.

1282
01:00:21,078 --> 01:00:26,122
>> ONE NIGHT, I FOUND MYSELF
HAPPILY SALSA DANCING IN SLOW
MOTION WITH MY WHITE HUSBAND.

1283
01:00:26,122 --> 01:00:28,413
THAT'S WHEN I KNEW I SHOULD
CONTACT MY DOCTOR.

1284
01:00:28,413 --> 01:00:31,228
SURE ENOUGH.
IT WAS HERPES.

1285
01:00:31,228 --> 01:00:34,129
>> I WAS EXPERIENCING PAINFUL
GENITAL SORES,

1286
01:00:34,129 --> 01:00:35,683
BUT THAT COULD BE
ANYTHING.

1287
01:00:35,683 --> 01:00:39,966
ROCK CLIMBING IN SLO-MO, THOUGH,
THAT ONLY MEANS ONE THING,
HERPES.

1288
01:00:39,966 --> 01:00:41,726
>> HERPES IS EASILY SPREAD.

1289
01:00:41,726 --> 01:00:45,647
JUST LOOK FOR SIGNS LIKE DANCING
IN AN OUTDOOR BEER GARDEN.
STRING LIGHTS.

1290
01:00:45,647 --> 01:00:48,162
WINNING A CARNIVAL GAME ON THE
FIRST TRY.

1291
01:00:48,162 --> 01:00:52,250
CHEERING IN THE FRONT ROW OF A
FOLK ROCK CONCERT IN A VERY
SMALL SPACE.

1292
01:00:52,250 --> 01:00:55,659
HANGING OUT WITH EXACTLY ONE
WHITE PERSON, ONE BLACK PERSON,

1293
01:00:55,659 --> 01:00:58,320
ONE ASIAN PERSON, ONE LATIN
PERSON.

1294
01:00:58,320 --> 01:01:02,922
IF YOU'RE HANGING OUT IN THE
SLO-MO GROUP, IT MAY BE HARD TO
KNOW WHICH FRIEND IS THE ONE
WITH THE HERPES.

1295
01:01:02,922 --> 01:01:06,615
IT'S SIMPLE.
IT'S THE ONE WHO'S HAVING THE
MOST FUN.

1296
01:01:06,615 --> 01:01:07,682
WHAT

1297
01:01:07,682 --> 01:01:10,546
NOT ALL SLO-MO ACTIVITIES ARE
SIGNS OF HERPES.

1298
01:01:10,546 --> 01:01:13,726
IF YOU'RE A WOMAN WEARING A
GENERIC MEN'S FOOTBALL JERSEY AND NO PANTS,

1299
01:01:13,726 --> 01:01:16,162
YOUR HUSBAND HAS
ERECTILE DYSFUNCTION.

1300
01:01:16,162 --> 01:01:18,077
IF YOUR CHILD IS SHOWING YOU A DRAWING,

1301
01:01:18,077 --> 01:01:19,426
YOU'RE CLINICALLY
DEPRESSED.

1302
01:01:19,426 --> 01:01:23,028
IF YOU FIND YOURSELF IN A BIG
MUSICAL NUMBER IN THE MIDDLE OF AN OFFICE,

1303
01:01:23,028 --> 01:01:25,731
YOU HAVE DIABETES.
OR DIARRHEA.

1304
01:01:25,731 --> 01:01:29,520
SO BE SMART AND GET TESTED
TODAY.

1305
01:01:31,821 --> 01:01:34,314
OH, NO.

1306
01:01:34,314 --> 01:01:36,427
KNOW THE SIGNS AND TREAT THE
SYMPTOMS

1307
01:01:36,427 --> 01:01:39,248
WITH ONCE-DAILY
HERPE-STOPPER.

1308
01:01:39,248 --> 01:01:42,906
WE TRIED TO COME UP WITH A
BETTER NAME, BUT NOBODY COULD
THINK OF ONE.

1309
01:02:01,150 --> 01:02:08,290
WELCOME TO WILD FARM FOODS, INC.

1310
01:02:08,292 --> 01:02:09,424
REALLY EXCITED TO HAVE A NEW

1311
01:02:09,426 --> 01:02:10,425
BATCH OF EMPLOYEES.

1312
01:02:10,427 --> 01:02:11,326
>> GREAT TO BE HERE.

1313
01:02:11,328 --> 01:02:13,128
>> NOW, HAVE YOU GUYS EVER DONE

1314
01:02:13,130 --> 01:02:14,663
AN ICE BREAKER BEFORE?

1315
01:02:14,665 --> 01:02:15,263
>> OH.

1316
01:02:15,265 --> 01:02:15,630
>> YEAH.

1317
01:02:15,632 --> 01:02:17,566
>> PLENTY, LOVE THEM.

1318
01:02:17,568 --> 01:02:18,366
>> THAT'S GREAT.

1319
01:02:18,368 --> 01:02:20,135
WHAT I'D LOVE TO DO IS GO AROUND

1320
01:02:20,137 --> 01:02:22,304
THE ROOM, AND YOU CAN EACH SAY

1321
01:02:22,306 --> 01:02:24,306
YOUR NAME AND A FUN FACT ABOUT

1322
01:02:24,308 --> 01:02:24,673
YOURSELF.

1323
01:02:24,675 --> 01:02:26,775
THEN WE'LL TRY TO REMEMBER

1324
01:02:26,777 --> 01:02:27,776
EVERYONE'S NAMES AND FACTS.

1325
01:02:27,778 --> 01:02:28,510
I CAN GO FIRST.

1326
01:02:28,512 --> 01:02:31,046
I'M CHRIS, AND I LOVE GARDENING.

1327
01:02:31,048 --> 01:02:33,481
>> I AM DEREK, AND I HAVE A

1328
01:02:33,483 --> 01:02:33,882

1329
01:02:33,884 --> 01:02:34,382
>> OH!

1330
01:02:34,384 --> 01:02:35,984
>> WOW, OKAY.

1331
01:02:35,986 --> 01:02:38,520
>> I AM CASSIDY, AND I WAS A

01:02:40,991 --> 01:02:42,557

01:02:57,341 --> 01:02:57,639

01:03:07,017 --> 01:03:07,616

1346

>> IT'S OKAY.

1350
01:03:15,025 --> 01:03:16,258
SO, CAN ANYONE REMEMBER ANYONE

1351
01:03:16,260 --> 01:03:17,626

I SAID YES.

YOU KNOW, I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE

1441
01:05:49,379 --> 01:05:51,279
GOOD TO GET TO KNOW EACH OTHER.

1442
01:05:51,281 --> 01:05:53,314
IT WAS LEGIT A HUGE MISTAKE.
