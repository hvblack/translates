1
00:00:06,798 --> 00:00:10,637
No.
No, no. This can't be happening.

2
00:00:10,637 --> 00:00:12,280
I-I-I'm too young.

3
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:15,118
No, why are you doing this?
I don't want to change.

4
00:00:15,118 --> 00:00:17,039
I don't want to change.
Oh, God, it's hot.

5
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:20,544
It's always so goddamn hot.
Someone's got to crack a door
or a window.

6
00:00:20,607 --> 00:00:23,851
Oh, God, no.
It's all happening too fast.

7
00:00:23,851 --> 00:00:26,695
I had plans, and they
w-were perfect plans.

8
00:00:26,695 --> 00:00:29,570
This is just all too soon!

9
00:00:29,707 --> 00:00:32,131
What the hell was that about?

10
00:00:32,203 --> 00:00:35,826
I'll tell you what that
was about-- menopause.

11
00:00:35,826 --> 00:00:38,026
- What? Men... Menopause?
- Oh, for real?
- Oh, yeah, oh, yeah.

12
00:00:38,026 --> 00:00:39,728
I went through the same thing
with Barbara.

13
00:00:39,728 --> 00:00:42,551
Overnight, she became
completely irrational

14
00:00:42,551 --> 00:00:46,167
with the hot flashes
and the mood swings
and the paranoia.

15
00:00:46,167 --> 00:00:48,056
That was the worst.

16
00:00:48,056 --> 00:00:50,309
Always accusing me
of having affairs.

17
00:00:50,309 --> 00:00:52,499
Hmm, right. But you were
having affairs.

18
00:00:52,499 --> 00:00:56,100
Yeah, but it was
a real headache,
and you can't have
that around here.

19
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:59,102
I don't want this to be taken
the wrong way 'cause,

20
00:00:59,146 --> 00:01:00,579
you know, I slept
with Dee that one time...

21
00:01:00,579 --> 00:01:03,364
-...but, like,
I'm, like,
sick of looking at her.

22
00:01:03,364 --> 00:01:05,224
You know? Is it, is it just me?

23
00:01:05,224 --> 00:01:07,357
- No.
- Okay.
- No.
- No, it's not just you.

24
00:01:07,357 --> 00:01:09,693
- Okay, yeah, 'cause I'm not
trying to be mean,
it's not personal.

25
00:01:09,693 --> 00:01:11,641
You're just being honest
about how you feel.
- Yeah.

26
00:01:11,641 --> 00:01:13,861
- Also, there's a smell.
There's a smell, yeah.

27
00:01:13,861 --> 00:01:17,500
And a lot of women have this,
and it makes me sick
to my stomach,

28
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:19,766
and-and I don't want
to be around it,
and I think that's
what you're saying.

29
00:01:19,766 --> 00:01:23,819
Well, no, I haven't
noticed a smell so much,
but, no, I'm just
saying, like...

30
00:01:23,819 --> 00:01:26,998
I feel a lot of tension
in the workplace
'cause we slept together,
you know?

31
00:01:26,998 --> 00:01:30,265
- Legally, that's called
a hostile work environment.
- Okay, I can see that.

32
00:01:30,265 --> 00:01:33,827
We can legally fire her
and bring in
whichever man we want.

33
00:01:33,827 --> 00:01:36,755
Oh... okay.
I see, I see where you
were going with that.

34
00:01:36,755 --> 00:01:40,082
Yeah, he's got an agenda.
Uh, but either way,
it-it doesn't matter.

35
00:01:40,082 --> 00:01:42,724
The point is,
what we're talking about here
is replacing Dee,

36
00:01:42,724 --> 00:01:45,838
and I think it's a great idea.
I think, I think
it's long overdue.

37
00:01:45,838 --> 00:01:48,064
Look, if we're going to
bring in another woman,

38
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:50,368
can we at least make sure
she's competent?

39
00:01:50,368 --> 00:01:54,941
Competent?
A monkey could do Dee's job.

40
00:01:55,583 --> 00:01:57,288
- A monkey could.

41
00:01:57,288 --> 00:02:00,324
REPLACE

42
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,755
Terrific. Thanks for coming in.
All right.

43
00:02:19,755 --> 00:02:22,693
Move. Move. Not gonna get it.
No. G-Give me a break.
- Move.

44
00:02:22,693 --> 00:02:25,877
- Wait, what is...
- You listen to me right now,
Jeffrey. You listen to me!

45
00:02:25,877 --> 00:02:27,961
Because I have been listening
to you for long enough.

46
00:02:27,961 --> 00:02:29,799
I'm sor-- Who-who-who are you?

47
00:02:29,799 --> 00:02:33,198
No!
No, no, no.
This can't be happening.

48
00:02:33,198 --> 00:02:37,358
This can't be happening,
I'm too young.
Why are you doing this
to me? Why?

49
00:02:37,358 --> 00:02:38,949
I-I-I-- No.
I don't want to change.

50
00:02:38,949 --> 00:02:41,033
Y-You're not thinking
straight, Cassandra.

51
00:02:41,033 --> 00:02:44,388
Oh, God, it's so hot.
Why is it always so goddamn hot?

52
00:02:44,388 --> 00:02:46,024
Somebody ought
to crack a window.

53
00:02:46,024 --> 00:02:49,337
No, I-I-I need more time.
I had it all planned out.

54
00:02:49,337 --> 00:02:54,821
It was perfect,
and this is just too soon!

55
00:02:54,909 --> 00:02:59,674
Oh, God!

56
00:03:02,211 --> 00:03:05,884
And that's the scene.
Yes, I'm aware.

57
00:03:05,972 --> 00:03:10,823
I'm done. I was
in character before,
but I'm me now, so you can
tell me how good I was.

58
00:03:10,823 --> 00:03:14,147
Oh, okay. Well, you just cut
in front of 15 other actresses.

59
00:03:14,147 --> 00:03:17,297
You're welcome. I took a gander
at 'em and...

60
00:03:17,372 --> 00:03:21,521
Plus, I do feel
like that's what
the character would have done,
and I've been
in character all day.

61
00:03:21,521 --> 00:03:24,990
As a matter of fact,
don't want to brag,
but I've been
in character all week.

62
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:27,334
- Okay, well,
uh, I don't think you're
quite what we're looking...

63
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:32,900
Come on, man! No, I-I-I've
been coming here for years,
and-and you never put me
past you to the director.

64
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:37,314
Well, uh, listen,
we have a-a lot of people
are going to be reading
for this role.

65
00:03:37,314 --> 00:03:39,955
No! I'm gonna see the director.
You're gonna put me through
to the director,
that's what you're gonna do,

66
00:03:39,955 --> 00:03:43,501
'cause I deserve it.
I deserve it.
I am a trained actor. Okay?

67
00:03:43,501 --> 00:03:46,641
I have spent
thousands of dollars
on acting classes,

68
00:03:46,641 --> 00:03:51,739
and are you gonna
try and tell me
that was just all for nothing?
That all that money
was just a waste?

69
00:03:51,739 --> 00:03:56,237
Well, uh,
not for your acting teacher.

70
00:04:01,726 --> 00:04:06,017
You know, guys, it occurs to me
that, with this new employee,

71
00:04:06,017 --> 00:04:09,578
we could be looking
at a lot less work
and a lot more available time.

72
00:04:09,578 --> 00:04:14,137
- Perhaps we should
consider a vacation.
- Oh, that's not a bad idea, man.

73
00:04:14,137 --> 00:04:18,088
I've actually been getting
a lot more comfortable
with the idea of travel
lately, like, um,

74
00:04:18,088 --> 00:04:21,936
check this out,
did you guys know that, uh,
Pittsburgh is in Pennsylvania?

75
00:04:21,936 --> 00:04:23,097
- Yes.
- Yeah.

76
00:04:23,097 --> 00:04:26,340
No, think about that,
though, that-that's crazy.
Like, two cities in one state?

77
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:28,833
- No, that's-that's not crazy.
- No. No, not at all.

78
00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:31,896
No, no, no.
All right, I don't think
you understand.

79
00:04:31,896 --> 00:04:34,816
There's two cities
in the same state,
like, how is that even possible?

80
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:38,790
- All states have
more than one city.
- That's totally possible.
Yeah, multiple cities.

81
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:41,422
N... No.
- Yes.
- There's... No.
- Yes.

82
00:04:41,422 --> 00:04:45,026
- There's...
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
- Yes.

83
00:04:45,026 --> 00:04:47,012
So, that's what Pennsylvania is.

84
00:04:47,012 --> 00:04:48,456
- Oh, no.
- No.

85
00:04:48,456 --> 00:04:50,220
Oh, so Philadelphia's
not Pennsylvania?

86
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:52,974
- No.
- No.
No, Philadelphia
is in Pennsylvania--

87
00:04:52,974 --> 00:04:54,430
- What is this man talking about?
- I...

88
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:58,334
I'm saying, how does Pittsburgh
work? Am I constantly
going in and out of Pittsburgh
throughout the day, yes or no?

89
00:04:58,334 --> 00:05:00,821
No.
Explain this to me.

90
00:05:00,821 --> 00:05:04,626
Oh. Oh, I understand.
I think I understand...
- Finally, somebody gets it.

91
00:05:04,626 --> 00:05:08,632
He's saying he wants
to go on a vacation.
He wants to go
somewhere exotic.

92
00:05:08,632 --> 00:05:12,442
- He wants to go to Fire Island.
He wants to go to Greece.
He wants to experiment.

93
00:05:12,442 --> 00:05:13,588
- No. That's not
what I'm saying, no.
- He wants to try new things.

94
00:05:13,588 --> 00:05:16,141
- That is not what he said.
Wait, we're not going
to Pittsburgh.

95
00:05:16,141 --> 00:05:19,223
- 'Cause we're already there.
- We're not in Pittsburgh.
We're in Philadel--

96
00:05:19,223 --> 00:05:21,253
- I-- This-this is not easy.

97
00:05:21,253 --> 00:05:24,038
Hey-o. Check it out.

98
00:05:24,107 --> 00:05:27,418
What the hell is this?
It's Dee's replacement.

99
00:05:27,418 --> 00:05:32,357
- Why did you get a monkey?
- Well, you know, we're gonna hire
a girl to do Dee's job.

100
00:05:32,357 --> 00:05:37,254
We're gonna have to pay her. You
don't have to pay a monkey shit,
so I got a monkey instead.

101
00:05:37,331 --> 00:05:39,813
It's like I said,
a monkey could do her job.

102
00:05:39,813 --> 00:05:43,065
Okay, but that's
just an expression, Frank.
We need an actual person.

103
00:05:43,065 --> 00:05:45,136
Oh, yeah? Check this out.

104
00:05:45,136 --> 00:05:47,662
- Monkey, beer.

105
00:05:52,123 --> 00:05:54,398
See? Great, huh?

106
00:05:54,398 --> 00:05:58,943
No. No, not great. Ridiculous.
You think a monkey
can run a bar?

107
00:05:58,943 --> 00:06:02,618
Run a bar?
I thought it was just
to do Dee's job.

108
00:06:02,618 --> 00:06:05,016
Oh, yeah. We need someone
to watch over the bar

109
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:05,850
-'cause we're gonna
go on vacation now.
- Right.

110
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:09,575
- Ooh, vacation?
Has anybody floated out
Pittsburgh?
- Ah.

111
00:06:09,575 --> 00:06:12,625
What is with you guys
and Pittsburgh?
Okay, we're not going
to Pittsburgh.

112
00:06:12,625 --> 00:06:15,355
If we're gonna go on vacation,
we're gonna go someplace good.

113
00:06:15,355 --> 00:06:16,985
- Yeah, thanks.

114
00:06:16,985 --> 00:06:18,630
I mean, we've got
the whole world to choose from,

115
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:22,409
and you guys want to go
to the second-best city
in-in Pennsylvania?
It's crazy.

116
00:06:22,409 --> 00:06:26,031
- Well, I don't know, like,
are we in Pittsburgh right now?
Like, you know, how does
Pittsburgh work, you know?
- Pretty nice. We like Pittsburgh.

117
00:06:26,031 --> 00:06:27,765
Whoa, hang on a second now.

118
00:06:27,765 --> 00:06:31,300
That is really good.
What'd the monkey put in this?

119
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:33,306
Beats me.

120
00:06:33,621 --> 00:06:36,894
Okay, well,
it's-it's very, very delicious,
uh...

121
00:06:36,894 --> 00:06:39,676
What's the deal
with this monkey, anyway?
He some kind of mixologist?

122
00:06:39,743 --> 00:06:43,359
He used to work in the movies.
He comes from a long line
of movie monkeys.

123
00:06:43,359 --> 00:06:48,394
Rumor has it
that he also did a short stint
making drinks for Kitty Dukakis.

124
00:06:48,394 --> 00:06:51,086
- Wow.
- Yeah.
- Okay, okay. Interesting.
- You know those were stiff.

125
00:06:51,086 --> 00:06:55,001
Eventually, we're gonna need
an actual person
to run the bar
if we're gonna go on vacation, you know, 

126
00:06:55,001 --> 00:06:58,689
but, uh,
while we're landing
on where exactly to go,
let's, uh...

127
00:06:59,965 --> 00:07:04,543
Let's keep the monkey
around 'cause that is
the best beer I've ever had in
my entire life, I swear to God.

128
00:07:04,543 --> 00:07:08,126
Dee has never made a beer
that tastes like that.
You guys got to try this.

129
00:07:08,126 --> 00:07:10,922
- Monkey.
Three more.

130
00:07:12,823 --> 00:07:15,000
- Look at that.

131
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,570
Hello. Good afternoon.
I'm Deandra Reynolds,

132
00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:23,486
and thank you all so much
for joining my acting class.

133
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:24,966
For starters...

134
00:07:26,228 --> 00:07:28,099
I don't have a limp.

135
00:07:28,143 --> 00:07:30,667
Right?

136
00:07:30,711 --> 00:07:32,321
Don't be shy.

137
00:07:32,364 --> 00:07:34,584
- Thank you.

138
00:07:34,628 --> 00:07:36,934
Thank you so much. Thank you.

139
00:07:36,978 --> 00:07:38,762
Oh, here's the thing,

140
00:07:38,806 --> 00:07:41,069
the first order of business,

141
00:07:41,112 --> 00:07:44,420
and perhaps the most
important thing, is payment.

142
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:47,162
Now, did everyone have a chance
to get cash or cashier's check?

143
00:07:47,205 --> 00:07:48,990
Okay, good. Great.

144
00:07:49,033 --> 00:07:50,557
Great, wonderful.
Okay, well, let's get started.

145
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,949
- Chain saw,

146
00:07:51,993 --> 00:07:54,778
avocado, marlin.
What'd I just say? You.

147
00:07:54,822 --> 00:07:58,565
Um... chain saw,
avocado, marlin?

148
00:07:58,608 --> 00:08:00,088
Right!

149
00:08:00,131 --> 00:08:01,524
Which is wrong.

150
00:08:01,568 --> 00:08:05,223
You just violated
the first rule of acting.

151
00:08:05,267 --> 00:08:06,442
You listened.

152
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:07,878
When you are listening,

153
00:08:07,922 --> 00:08:09,401
you are not talking,

154
00:08:09,445 --> 00:08:11,229
and if you're not talking,
you're not getting paid.

155
00:08:11,273 --> 00:08:14,058
You know who doesn't talk
throughout an entire movie?

156
00:08:14,102 --> 00:08:15,320
An extra.

157
00:08:15,364 --> 00:08:18,019
Which brings me
to rule number two,

158
00:08:18,062 --> 00:08:20,064
acting is...

159
00:08:20,108 --> 00:08:21,892
Oh, um, reacting.

160
00:08:21,936 --> 00:08:25,069
Wrong again. Acting is ignoring.

161
00:08:25,113 --> 00:08:26,462
Think about it.

162
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:27,898
Ignore reality.

163
00:08:27,942 --> 00:08:30,074
You're in a casting office,
not Jurassic Park.

164
00:08:30,118 --> 00:08:31,772
Ignore your scene partner

165
00:08:31,815 --> 00:08:33,948
because you better goddamn
believe they're ignoring you.

166
00:08:33,991 --> 00:08:36,994
And, for Christ's sake,
ignore the script, okay?

167
00:08:37,038 --> 00:08:39,170
You're better
than a writer, right?

168
00:08:39,214 --> 00:08:40,215
Writers are dorks, okay?

169
00:08:40,258 --> 00:08:42,826
Any questions?

170
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:45,133
No! Put your hands down!

171
00:08:45,176 --> 00:08:46,613
No.

172
00:08:46,656 --> 00:08:47,918
Don't ask questions.

173
00:08:47,962 --> 00:08:49,354
That shows
you don't know something,

174
00:08:49,398 --> 00:08:50,530
which makes you look weak.

175
00:08:50,573 --> 00:08:52,532
Got it?

176
00:08:52,575 --> 00:08:54,925
Now, if we could circle back
on the payment thing again,

177
00:08:54,969 --> 00:08:57,058
it's pretty important
to me, okay?

178
00:08:57,101 --> 00:08:58,581
'Cause I'm-I'm dead serious,

179
00:08:58,625 --> 00:09:02,367
you're not walking out of here
without the payment.

180
00:09:02,411 --> 00:09:03,586
Oh, my God, Charlie,

181
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:05,545
we're not going to Scranton.

182
00:09:05,588 --> 00:09:07,547
All right, fine. What about
Harrisburg? Williamsport?

183
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:08,722
Altoona? You know...

184
00:09:08,765 --> 00:09:10,419
Okay, will you at least consider

185
00:09:10,462 --> 00:09:12,116
going someplace
outside of Pennsylvania?

186
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:15,206
All those cities
are in Pennsylvania?

187
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:16,643
Are you kidding me?
Like, you don't want to know--

188
00:09:16,686 --> 00:09:17,948
thank you, monkey--
you don't want to know, like,

189
00:09:17,992 --> 00:09:19,602
how this shit works, man?

190
00:09:19,646 --> 00:09:22,779
No. I don't want to find out
how zoning districts work.

191
00:09:22,823 --> 00:09:24,825
I don't care about that.
Thank you, monkey.

192
00:09:24,868 --> 00:09:26,391
I want to go somewhere exotic.

193
00:09:26,435 --> 00:09:27,654
Baltimore?

194
00:09:27,697 --> 00:09:29,612
- Baltimore is not exotic, Frank.
No.

195
00:09:29,656 --> 00:09:32,267
I'll tell you, I've seen shit
happen in Baltimore

196
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:34,225
- that would blow your mind.
Thank you, monkey.
- Wow.

197
00:09:34,269 --> 00:09:35,923
You know what, guys?
I'll tell you what.

198
00:09:35,966 --> 00:09:36,880
Regardless of where
we decide to go,

199
00:09:36,924 --> 00:09:38,447
we're taking this goddamn monkey

200
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:40,188
- because I love this guy.
I love him.
- Oh, yeah.

201
00:09:40,231 --> 00:09:42,146
It would be great
if we could hire more monkeys

202
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:44,148
to do our job for us
while we're gone.

203
00:09:44,192 --> 00:09:46,455
Like, a team of monkeys who run
the bar, you know what I mean?

204
00:09:46,498 --> 00:09:49,066
- Mm.
- Oh, yeah, 'cause they're all
out of work now, you know?

205
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:51,025
Yeah.
- Yeah, because Hollywood decided

206
00:09:51,068 --> 00:09:53,636
you can't beat 'em no more, so
they had to set 'em all free.

207
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,116
- What?
- Are you seriously?
- You can't beat monkeys?

208
00:09:55,159 --> 00:09:56,291
- No, you can't.
- At all?

209
00:09:56,334 --> 00:09:57,858
Those monkeys don't even
have jobs anymore

210
00:09:57,901 --> 00:09:59,033
-'cause of these snowflakes?
- Not allowed to do it no more.

211
00:09:59,076 --> 00:10:00,861
- These Hollywood...
- Oh, my God.

212
00:10:00,904 --> 00:10:02,036
I do have to admit, though,

213
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:04,516
it-it is a little
disappointing to, um,

214
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,694
discover that a team of primates
could do our jobs for us, but...

215
00:10:07,737 --> 00:10:09,304
I'm gonna blow past it

216
00:10:09,347 --> 00:10:10,610
because I really do
want to come up

217
00:10:10,653 --> 00:10:11,915
with a vacation spot
for us, you know?

218
00:10:11,959 --> 00:10:13,830
So, here's what
I'm thinking, guys.

219
00:10:13,874 --> 00:10:15,615
E-Everybody grab a napkin
there, okay?

220
00:10:15,658 --> 00:10:16,441
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
- Grab a napkin.

221
00:10:16,485 --> 00:10:18,400
And, uh, everybody

222
00:10:18,443 --> 00:10:21,272
write down a destination
on the napkin,

223
00:10:21,316 --> 00:10:22,883
and then we'll put
that destination

224
00:10:22,926 --> 00:10:25,059
in this bowl right here,

225
00:10:25,102 --> 00:10:26,713
I'll pick one out,

226
00:10:26,756 --> 00:10:28,584
- and that way
not one of us decides...
- Oh.

227
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:30,673
...but we let fate take over.

228
00:10:30,717 --> 00:10:32,457
- What do you guys think
about that plan?
- Okay.

229
00:10:32,501 --> 00:10:34,024
I didn't say that

230
00:10:34,068 --> 00:10:36,157
- I don't love you.
- Then what is it?

231
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,811
Is it my gang ties?
Because I don't need that shit.

232
00:10:37,854 --> 00:10:39,116
I'll leave it all behind.

233
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:41,336
- Just tell me what's wrong.

234
00:10:41,379 --> 00:10:42,554
The baby...

235
00:10:42,598 --> 00:10:45,166
It's not yours. It's my...

236
00:10:45,209 --> 00:10:47,168
my...

237
00:10:47,211 --> 00:10:49,257
- my father's.
- Bigger.

238
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:51,172
My father's!
- N-- louder.

239
00:10:51,215 --> 00:10:54,131
My father's!
- Yes!

240
00:10:54,175 --> 00:10:55,350
Good. Now you go.

241
00:10:56,786 --> 00:10:59,136
- Your father's?!
- Louder.

242
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:01,661
Your father's?!

243
00:11:01,704 --> 00:11:04,794
Okay! Now, this is what
I'm talking about.

244
00:11:04,838 --> 00:11:06,666
Nice work.
Do you all see that?

245
00:11:06,709 --> 00:11:08,755
Goddamn, that's what I want.
I want to be able

246
00:11:08,798 --> 00:11:10,626
to see your performance
from the fucking moon.

247
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,802
Guys, the louder you are,

248
00:11:12,846 --> 00:11:15,326
the more people have
to pay attention to you.

249
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:18,242
Yeah... Yeah,
I-I don't understand the script.

250
00:11:18,286 --> 00:11:19,548
What movie did you say
this was from?

251
00:11:19,591 --> 00:11:21,811
I-I didn't. I wrote it.

252
00:11:21,855 --> 00:11:23,944
It's a mash-up of Chinatown

253
00:11:23,987 --> 00:11:26,163
and Tupac Shakur's
Poetic Justice.

254
00:11:26,207 --> 00:11:28,600
Oh. Are you, are you gonna
write all the scenes?

255
00:11:28,644 --> 00:11:31,734
Well, there you go asking a
bunch of questions again, Tony.

256
00:11:31,778 --> 00:11:32,996
Uh, Kiki,

257
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,781
how does that
make him seem to you?

258
00:11:34,824 --> 00:11:37,218
Um... weak?

259
00:11:37,261 --> 00:11:39,046
Weak! Good. Very good.

260
00:11:39,089 --> 00:11:40,830
Now, you, Kiki,
you're really getting this.

261
00:11:40,874 --> 00:11:42,266
But did you feel that?

262
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:43,964
Did you feel how he went
from, like, a hot stud

263
00:11:44,007 --> 00:11:46,183
you'd like to bang
to a weak little bitch

264
00:11:46,227 --> 00:11:48,011
right before your eyes? Right?

265
00:11:48,055 --> 00:11:49,883
I mean, that doesn't mean
I still wouldn't do him,

266
00:11:49,926 --> 00:11:51,449
but that's between him and me.

267
00:11:51,493 --> 00:11:53,060
Tony, see me after class.

268
00:11:53,103 --> 00:11:55,758
Um... Okay.

269
00:11:55,802 --> 00:11:58,587
Wrong! Wrong! Okay.

270
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:00,981
People in power
will try and bang you.

271
00:12:01,024 --> 00:12:04,419
Now, sometimes it will be
necessary to get the part,

272
00:12:04,462 --> 00:12:06,508
but assess the situation.

273
00:12:06,551 --> 00:12:08,553
Why go all the way when
a simple hand job will suffice?

274
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:12,862
Tony, do see me after class.

275
00:12:12,906 --> 00:12:14,603
And the place

276
00:12:14,646 --> 00:12:16,431
that we're going to is...

277
00:12:18,563 --> 00:12:20,957
"Yell"... "Yellow"?

278
00:12:21,001 --> 00:12:23,177
What is, what is this?
Who, who wrote this?

279
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:26,354
Uh... Me. Yeah.

280
00:12:26,397 --> 00:12:28,660
W-Were you trying to
s-say Yellowstone or...?

281
00:12:28,704 --> 00:12:31,620
Uh... no. Uh, just yellow.

282
00:12:31,663 --> 00:12:33,056
- Just yellow?
Just the color yellow?
- Uh, well, I panicked.

283
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:34,405
You know, you were shooting down
all the other places

284
00:12:34,449 --> 00:12:35,972
I've been naming, so I-I
couldn't think of something.

285
00:12:36,016 --> 00:12:38,105
Okay, well, that's not
a goddamn place, you idiot, so..

286
00:12:38,148 --> 00:12:39,584
We're gonna try this again.

287
00:12:39,628 --> 00:12:41,499
Next place I pick out,
that's where we're gonna go.

288
00:12:41,543 --> 00:12:43,371
Mm-hmm.

289
00:12:43,414 --> 00:12:44,764
-"Purple."
- Mm.

290
00:12:44,807 --> 00:12:46,200
What is happening?

291
00:12:46,243 --> 00:12:48,289
That was me.
Yeah, I did purple.

292
00:12:48,332 --> 00:12:49,551
- You did purple?
Two of you wrote colors?
- Yeah, I...

293
00:12:49,594 --> 00:12:51,031
Okay, so you thought
of a color, too?

294
00:12:51,074 --> 00:12:52,641
I didn't understand
the assignment either.

295
00:12:52,684 --> 00:12:54,512
- It-it was not clear.
- I said write down
a destination,

296
00:12:54,556 --> 00:12:55,687
- and two people
wrote down colors?
- We're sorry, we're sorry.

297
00:12:55,731 --> 00:12:57,167
- I don't understand...
- I like purple.

298
00:12:57,211 --> 00:12:58,865
I like purple, too, Frank.
That's why I wrote it down.

299
00:12:58,908 --> 00:13:00,692
Well, maybe we could go there.
That could be pretty.

300
00:13:00,736 --> 00:13:02,956
Go where?! Purple?
That's not a place!

301
00:13:02,999 --> 00:13:05,132
- That-- All right, you know...
Okay, you're right.

302
00:13:05,175 --> 00:13:08,352
I think, um...
these beers are a little strong.

303
00:13:08,396 --> 00:13:10,877
- Are you drunk?
- I-- these beers
are a little strong...

304
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,748
I will admit that the beers
are also stronger

305
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:14,445
- than I was anticipating.
- I like this beer.

306
00:13:14,489 --> 00:13:15,533
You know what, guys?

307
00:13:15,577 --> 00:13:17,492
I'm having a lot of fun here.

308
00:13:17,535 --> 00:13:19,494
Uh, but I do want to
figure this out, so, new plan.

309
00:13:19,537 --> 00:13:20,930
All right,
here's what we're gonna do.

310
00:13:20,974 --> 00:13:23,063
Instead of writing down places,

311
00:13:23,106 --> 00:13:26,109
why don't we write down
key words?

312
00:13:26,153 --> 00:13:27,632
Or phrases, you know?

313
00:13:27,676 --> 00:13:28,982
Let's go with our instincts,
you know?

314
00:13:29,025 --> 00:13:30,244
Whatever we want to feel,

315
00:13:30,287 --> 00:13:31,854
what-whatever
we want to experience

316
00:13:31,898 --> 00:13:33,334
on the vacation, okay? And then

317
00:13:33,377 --> 00:13:34,726
we'll put it up on a board.

318
00:13:34,770 --> 00:13:36,293
We'll look at it all together
and then maybe

319
00:13:36,337 --> 00:13:39,035
the destination will just
reveal itself to us.

320
00:13:39,079 --> 00:13:42,125
And... we can drink
more monkey beer.

321
00:13:42,169 --> 00:13:43,735
- Yeah.

322
00:13:43,779 --> 00:13:45,912
- Monkey!
- We'll drink monkey beer
while we're doing it.

323
00:13:45,955 --> 00:13:48,001
- Monkey.
- Four more monkey beers, monkey.

324
00:13:48,044 --> 00:13:49,829
- Monkey, monkey, monkey beer!
- Monkey! Four more!

325
00:13:52,527 --> 00:13:54,311
Ms. Reynolds, can I talk
to you for a second?

326
00:13:54,355 --> 00:13:56,792
Oh, God, what's this? Listen,
if you don't have the cash,

327
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:59,316
you're gonna want to borrow it
from, like, an uncle or a friend

328
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,927
or something 'cause I don't make
exceptions.

329
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:03,886
No. It's, uh, it's not
the money, um...

330
00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:06,671
I just wanted to say...
thank you.

331
00:14:06,715 --> 00:14:08,499
It feels

332
00:14:08,543 --> 00:14:10,545
so good to be seen like that.

333
00:14:10,588 --> 00:14:12,721
My parents don't really
believe in me, so...

334
00:14:12,764 --> 00:14:15,245
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait. Stop talking.

335
00:14:15,289 --> 00:14:17,944
Holy shit.

336
00:14:17,987 --> 00:14:20,555
You're making me
realize something here.

337
00:14:20,598 --> 00:14:21,904
Maybe this doesn't
have to be a scam.

338
00:14:21,948 --> 00:14:22,949
What?

339
00:14:22,992 --> 00:14:24,167
Well, what I mean is,

340
00:14:24,211 --> 00:14:25,908
I-I was just able
to give you something

341
00:14:25,952 --> 00:14:27,170
your parents never did,

342
00:14:27,214 --> 00:14:29,781
and all-all I had to do
was...

343
00:14:29,825 --> 00:14:32,436
toss you a single
compliment.

344
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,264
I can control you.

345
00:14:34,308 --> 00:14:37,528
I can make you feel
however I want you to feel,

346
00:14:37,572 --> 00:14:39,879
which will help you
be a better actor.

347
00:14:39,922 --> 00:14:42,011
- Oh, I do want to be a better...
- Shh. I'm not done.

348
00:14:42,055 --> 00:14:45,928
Oh, that's-that's
real power.

349
00:14:45,972 --> 00:14:48,757
Way more power than just acting,
and I think that's what it was

350
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,454
probably all about
for me, you know?

351
00:14:50,498 --> 00:14:52,761
I just... I was searching
for a sense of control.

352
00:14:52,804 --> 00:14:53,849
Oh, Kiki...

353
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:55,416
you were...

354
00:14:55,459 --> 00:14:57,113
terrible.

355
00:14:57,157 --> 00:14:59,072
Wait, I-I was?

356
00:14:59,115 --> 00:15:00,943
No. No.

357
00:15:00,987 --> 00:15:02,640
- I'm kidding.

358
00:15:02,684 --> 00:15:05,687
You were amazing.

359
00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:08,472
And you're going to make it.

360
00:15:08,516 --> 00:15:09,909
I believe in you.

361
00:15:09,952 --> 00:15:11,954
Oh, you do?

362
00:15:11,998 --> 00:15:13,869
Maybe.

363
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:15,697
I'm not going
to tell you right now.

364
00:15:18,091 --> 00:15:19,309
But yes.

365
00:15:21,224 --> 00:15:23,618
Oh, my God! This is...

366
00:15:23,661 --> 00:15:25,620
This is amazing. Yes, Kiki, yes.

367
00:15:25,663 --> 00:15:27,361
I'm going to be there for you.

368
00:15:27,404 --> 00:15:29,232
I'm going to be the mother
and father that you never had.

369
00:15:29,276 --> 00:15:31,843
- I'm only going to take 35%...

370
00:15:31,887 --> 00:15:32,888
...of all your future earnings,

371
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:34,629
and I will never, never

372
00:15:34,672 --> 00:15:37,327
turn my back on you,
do you understand?

373
00:15:37,371 --> 00:15:39,721
- Yes.
- Because you--
Can you give me one second?

374
00:15:39,764 --> 00:15:41,505
- My phone is buzzing
off the hook in my pocket.
- Oh, yeah.

375
00:15:41,549 --> 00:15:43,333
One sec. Hello?

376
00:15:43,377 --> 00:15:45,074
No! I'm gonna see the director.

377
00:15:45,118 --> 00:15:47,990
Um, hi, yes. Uh, is this
Deandra Reynolds?

378
00:15:48,034 --> 00:15:50,079
- Yup.
Right. Well, uh,

379
00:15:50,123 --> 00:15:51,907
-I'm so sorry to just call you
out of the blue like this...
- Faster.

380
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:53,691
- What?
- Faster.

381
00:15:53,735 --> 00:15:55,911
Right. Brilliant. Um,

382
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:57,782
well, I am the director
of the TV show

383
00:15:57,826 --> 00:15:58,870
that you crashed
the audition on the other day,

384
00:15:58,914 --> 00:16:01,264
and we have a role that...

385
00:16:01,308 --> 00:16:03,658
- Slower.

386
00:16:03,701 --> 00:16:04,920
All right, um,

387
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:07,401
well, as I was saying, I am...

388
00:16:07,444 --> 00:16:08,880
the... director...

389
00:16:08,924 --> 00:16:10,230
Too slow. Don't start over.

390
00:16:10,273 --> 00:16:13,363
Okay.
Uh, well, I saw your tape,

391
00:16:13,407 --> 00:16:16,888
and, based on what I saw,
and this conversation,

392
00:16:16,932 --> 00:16:18,847
I think we have a part
that might be right for you.

393
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:19,935
Stop.

394
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:22,894
Attention, everyone.

395
00:16:22,938 --> 00:16:25,245
Dee Reynolds Acting School
is officially closed.

396
00:16:25,288 --> 00:16:27,073
And I'm sorry, there will be
no return on investments,

397
00:16:27,116 --> 00:16:29,640
but it was in the fine print.
Have a wonderful afternoon.

398
00:16:29,684 --> 00:16:31,642
Continue.

399
00:16:36,865 --> 00:16:40,216
Oh, my God. Oh, guys.

400
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:43,219
- What the hell is happening?

401
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:45,221
Guys, wake up.
- Huh?

402
00:16:45,265 --> 00:16:46,222
- Wake...

403
00:16:46,266 --> 00:16:47,702
- Huh?
- Wha...

404
00:16:47,745 --> 00:16:49,878
Oh, my God.
My head is killing me.

405
00:16:49,921 --> 00:16:53,099
Oh, dude. I am very hungover.
I do not feel good.

406
00:16:53,142 --> 00:16:55,753
Charlie,
you're full of scratches.

407
00:16:55,797 --> 00:16:57,929
- So are you.

408
00:16:57,973 --> 00:16:59,844
- Wait, I got scratches, too.
- Oh, shit.

409
00:16:59,888 --> 00:17:02,151
- Dude, Mac, I think you
got bit in the neck, man.

410
00:17:02,195 --> 00:17:03,761
- Is that shit on the bar?

411
00:17:03,805 --> 00:17:05,502
What-what is that...

412
00:17:05,546 --> 00:17:08,331
sour, salty taste in my mouth?
Do you guys have that?

413
00:17:08,375 --> 00:17:09,680
- Yeah, I got that.
- Yes. Yes, I have that.

414
00:17:09,724 --> 00:17:12,161
- What is that?
- Yeah, it's real bad.

415
00:17:12,205 --> 00:17:13,249
Uh-oh, guys...

416
00:17:13,293 --> 00:17:14,642
Oh, yeah, I feel like shit.

417
00:17:14,685 --> 00:17:16,078
I think we've been outsmarted.

418
00:17:16,122 --> 00:17:17,384
- What?
- Huh?

419
00:17:17,427 --> 00:17:19,255
The monkey got us drunk,

420
00:17:19,299 --> 00:17:20,387
assaulted us,

421
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:21,779
robbed the bar,

422
00:17:21,823 --> 00:17:23,651
and possibly fucked our mouths.

423
00:17:26,610 --> 00:17:28,917
- Oh, God!
- Yeah, he did.
That is what happened.

424
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,266
Yeah, the guy who sold him to me

425
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:31,876
did say something
like this could happen.

426
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,530
He did?!

427
00:17:33,574 --> 00:17:35,358
Yeah. Apparently,
the monkey's grandfather

428
00:17:35,402 --> 00:17:37,795
was Fatty Arbuckle's monkey,

429
00:17:37,839 --> 00:17:38,883
and you know
how these things go.

430
00:17:38,927 --> 00:17:40,711
These monkeys are passed down

431
00:17:40,755 --> 00:17:42,757
from one Hollywood creep
to the next,

432
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,150
until, eventually,

433
00:17:44,193 --> 00:17:46,282
they wind up
under a bridge in Philly

434
00:17:46,326 --> 00:17:48,458
getting drunk and pulling scams.

435
00:17:48,502 --> 00:17:51,244
Goddamn. All right.
- What?

436
00:17:51,287 --> 00:17:53,072
All right, all right, we got
to think about this. All right,

437
00:17:53,115 --> 00:17:56,162
so let's not take the monkey
on our vacation.

438
00:17:56,205 --> 00:17:57,946
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

439
00:17:57,989 --> 00:17:59,426
The vacation.

440
00:17:59,469 --> 00:18:01,080
I think we landed on a
vacation destination last night.

441
00:18:01,123 --> 00:18:03,343
Yeah, we did, we did.
Look, look, look.

442
00:18:03,386 --> 00:18:04,822
- Oh, look at the board.
- We did?
- Yeah.

443
00:18:04,866 --> 00:18:06,215
We got something on here.
Let's um...

444
00:18:06,259 --> 00:18:08,130
Okay, should we see
where we're going?

445
00:18:08,174 --> 00:18:10,306
- Yeah, where are we going?
- Where we going? Where we going?

446
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:12,700
All right, here we go...

447
00:18:12,743 --> 00:18:14,745
"Monkey beer island

448
00:18:14,789 --> 00:18:17,008
of green and fight."

449
00:18:17,052 --> 00:18:19,098
Goddamn it.
- That's not a place.

450
00:18:19,141 --> 00:18:20,708
- That's not a place?
- No, it's not!

451
00:18:20,751 --> 00:18:23,145
No, it's not a goddamn place.
You know what this is?

452
00:18:23,189 --> 00:18:24,799
This is the ramblings
of four men

453
00:18:24,842 --> 00:18:26,322
who got very, very drunk last
night on a mystery concoction

454
00:18:26,366 --> 00:18:28,368
invented by a wild animal.

455
00:18:28,411 --> 00:18:30,239
Why can't we just be normal?

456
00:18:30,283 --> 00:18:31,806
- That is what it is.
- That's so weird.

457
00:18:31,849 --> 00:18:33,024
Why would we do that?

458
00:18:33,068 --> 00:18:35,114
Because the monkey beers
were so delicious.

459
00:18:35,157 --> 00:18:37,203
All right? That-that-that monkey
may have been a pervert,

460
00:18:37,246 --> 00:18:39,944
but he was also a genius, which
is often the case in Hollywood.

461
00:18:39,988 --> 00:18:41,424
You know what I'm thinking?

462
00:18:41,468 --> 00:18:43,600
'Cause I'm seeing a lot of empty
whiskey bottles around,

463
00:18:43,644 --> 00:18:45,776
I'm thinking maybe that monkey
was just pouring, like,

464
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:47,169
half a bottle of whiskey
in each beer.

465
00:18:47,213 --> 00:18:48,170
- You know?
- That could be.

466
00:18:48,214 --> 00:18:49,302
Based on my hangover, I think

467
00:18:49,345 --> 00:18:50,651
that's what I'm,
that's what I'm feeling.

468
00:18:50,694 --> 00:18:51,782
Goddamn it.
- That tracks, that tracks.

469
00:18:51,826 --> 00:18:53,393
So, monkey beer

470
00:18:53,436 --> 00:18:55,656
is just whiskey...

471
00:18:55,699 --> 00:18:57,788
Whiskey-beer, yeah.
-...beer?

472
00:18:57,832 --> 00:19:00,400
So...

473
00:19:00,443 --> 00:19:04,273
"Whiskey beer island
of green and fight."

474
00:19:04,317 --> 00:19:05,405
- We're nowhere. We're nowhere.

475
00:19:05,448 --> 00:19:08,234
Hey-o! Whoa,
what the hell happened...

476
00:19:08,277 --> 00:19:10,671
Eh, you know what? Don't care.

477
00:19:10,714 --> 00:19:12,890
Do not even care
'cause guess what, dick nips.

478
00:19:12,934 --> 00:19:16,111
This big, dumb, flightless bird
just booked a huge acting gig.

479
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:18,548
Why don't you feast your eyes on

480
00:19:18,592 --> 00:19:21,377
"Obnoxious American MILF #1"?

481
00:19:23,249 --> 00:19:26,208
- In your faces. That's right.
- Ah...

482
00:19:26,252 --> 00:19:27,862
And guess what.
I leave tomorrow morning

483
00:19:27,905 --> 00:19:30,299
at 6:30 a.m.
on a first-class flight

484
00:19:30,343 --> 00:19:33,998
'cause it shoots
in Ireland, baby.

485
00:19:34,042 --> 00:19:36,131
Yeah!

486
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:37,437
Body slam!

487
00:19:40,744 --> 00:19:42,746
- I mean, she doesn't--
She comes in screaming.
- That was the worst.

488
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:44,400
- Screaming.
- Cackling like a witch.

489
00:19:44,444 --> 00:19:47,316
Just screaming and screeching,
like...

490
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,100
Oh, my God.

491
00:19:52,930 --> 00:19:55,455
Oh, my God.

492
00:19:57,761 --> 00:20:00,286
- What? What is it?

493
00:20:00,329 --> 00:20:01,591
- I don't know.
- Uh, you don't know?

494
00:20:01,635 --> 00:20:03,114
- Right? It wasn't clear.
- Frank looked at me...

495
00:20:03,158 --> 00:20:04,507
Why did you guys act like
you knew what it was, then?

496
00:20:04,551 --> 00:20:05,943
I don't know. We were all
getting excited together.

497
00:20:05,987 --> 00:20:07,206
- I was excited...
- And, yeah, uh...

498
00:20:07,249 --> 00:20:08,555
Goddamn it.
Frank, you tell them what it is.

499
00:20:08,598 --> 00:20:10,818
- Yeah, what is it?
- I don't know what it is.

500
00:20:10,861 --> 00:20:12,689
- You don't...
- Okay, yeah, we don't know,
uh, we don't know what it is.

501
00:20:12,733 --> 00:20:15,170
Guys, guys.

502
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:18,129
"Whiskey beer island
of green and fight."

503
00:20:18,173 --> 00:20:20,393
That's Ireland.

504
00:20:20,436 --> 00:20:22,046
Goddamn, you guys.

505
00:20:22,090 --> 00:20:24,527
What is this delicious drink?
This is good.

506
00:20:24,571 --> 00:20:26,181
I was gonna go home
and get some sleep,

507
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:28,096
but I might have to get
a couple soda pops in first,

508
00:20:28,139 --> 00:20:30,751
you know what I mean? Nice job.

509
00:20:30,794 --> 00:20:33,144
Mmm. Mmm.

510
00:20:34,929 --> 00:20:37,061
Ooh, wow. Is that poop?
