1
00:00:01,551 --> 00:00:04,803
EARLIER

2
00:00:04,803 --> 00:00:07,992
BRILLIANT IDEA TO GATHER ALL OF
OUR NATION'S TOP GENERALS

3
00:00:07,992 --> 00:00:09,662
IN ONE
PLACE AT ONE TIME.

4
00:00:09,662 --> 00:00:11,836
TO THROW OUR ENEMIES OFF THE SCENT,

5
00:00:11,836 --> 00:00:14,993
HE TOLD THEM EXACTLY
WHERE AND WHEN IT WOULD HAPPEN.

6
00:00:14,993 --> 00:00:17,688
WE TAKE YOU TO THIS MEETING NOW.

7
00:00:22,804 --> 00:00:25,187
>> TEN HUT!

8
00:00:25,341 --> 00:00:26,917
WELCOME, GENERALS.

9
00:00:27,099 --> 00:00:31,265
YOU HAVE ALL DEDICATED YOUR
LIVES TO DEFENDING THIS NATION.

10
00:00:31,265 --> 00:00:34,250
AS A REWARD, YOU WILL NOW BE YELLED AT

11
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:36,837
BY A FORMER FOX NEWS
HOST.

12
00:00:36,837 --> 00:00:40,891
PLEASE WELCOME THE SECRETARY OF WAR,

13
00:00:40,891 --> 00:00:43,008
PETE HEGSETH.

14
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:53,788
>> YEAH.

15
00:00:53,788 --> 00:00:55,754
CUT THE CRAP!

16
00:00:57,136 --> 00:00:59,194
LISTEN UP, EVERYONE, OKAY?

17
00:00:59,194 --> 00:01:04,804
I SUMMONED YOU ALL HERE TODAY TO
ADDRESS A SERIOUS PROBLEM.
OKAY?

18
00:01:04,804 --> 00:01:09,006
OUR MILITARY IS GAY
AS HELL.

19
00:01:09,617 --> 00:01:12,763
I'M NOT JUST TALKING ABOUT THE
NAVY.

20
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:17,234
THANKS TO FAILED LIBERAL POLICIES,

21
00:01:17,234 --> 00:01:19,793
OUR ARMY HAS NEVER BEEN GAYER,

22
00:01:19,793 --> 00:01:23,657
AND YET IT'S ALSO
NEVER BEEN FATTER.

23
00:01:23,657 --> 00:01:26,387
MAKE THAT MAKE SENSE.

24
00:01:26,387 --> 00:01:28,855
AM I RIGHT?

25
00:01:31,578 --> 00:01:34,118
YOU ALL ARE FUN.

26
00:01:34,118 --> 00:01:39,498
FROM NOW ON, OUR FIGHTING MEN
AND I GUESS WOMEN

27
00:01:39,498 --> 00:01:43,393
ARE GOING TO
ADHERE TO THE HIGHEST MALE
STANDARDS,

28
00:01:43,393 --> 00:01:47,390
WHICH HAVE BEEN SET
BY OUR PRESIDENT, DONALD TRUMP.

29
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:51,328
6'6".
BUCK 75.

30
00:01:51,328 --> 00:01:54,381
A-CUPS, PERKY,

31
00:01:54,381 --> 00:01:58,794
WITH A DUMPTRUCK
IN THE BACK YOU WOULDN'T EVEN
BELIEVE.

32
00:01:58,794 --> 00:02:01,960
AND HEY, YOU DON'T WANT TO LOSE
THE WEIGHT?

33
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,745
YOU DON'T WANT TO FOLLOW THE
RULES,

34
00:02:03,745 --> 00:02:08,265
NO PROBLEM.
YOU KNOW WHO IS GOING TO WANT
YOUR SICK, TWISTED FAT ASS?

35
00:02:08,265 --> 00:02:09,877
I.C.E.

36
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:14,216
WE HAVE A SIGN-UP SHEET IN THE
HALLWAY, CHECK THEM OUT.

37
00:02:14,216 --> 00:02:19,573
IN HERE WE'RE
DOING ARMY AND ONLY ARMY.

38
00:02:19,573 --> 00:02:22,489
AND WE'RE GOING TO BE DOING IT
IN ONE OF THE BLOODIEST,

39
00:02:22,489 --> 00:02:25,233
WAR-TORN PLACES ON FACE OF THE EARTH --

40
00:02:25,233 --> 00:02:27,891
PORTLAND, OREGON.

41
00:02:28,285 --> 00:02:31,388
NOW BACK TO THE FAT THING.

42
00:02:31,888 --> 00:02:36,907
OUR MILITARY WILL NOW HAVE THE
SAME RULES AS ANY GOOD FRAT
PARTY.

43
00:02:36,907 --> 00:02:39,610
NO FAT CHICKS.

44
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:45,129
IF YOU'RE A FAT DUDE, GODDAMN
IT, YOU BETTER BE FUNNY AS HELL.

45
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:50,634
IN SUMMARY -- THIS IS THE WHOLE MEETING,

46
00:02:50,634 --> 00:02:55,055
NO FUGGOS, NO FATTIES,

47
00:02:55,055 --> 00:02:58,414
NO FACIAL HAIR, NO BODY
HAIR.

48
00:02:58,414 --> 00:03:02,596
JUST HOT, SHREDDED, HAIRLESS MEN

49
00:03:02,596 --> 00:03:06,218
WHO ARE DEFINITELY NOT GAY.

50
00:03:06,218 --> 00:03:08,529
BECAUSE THIS IS SERIOUS.

51
00:03:08,529 --> 00:03:12,051
WE ARE FACING THE
GREATEST THREAT TO FREEDOM AND
DEMOCRACY

52
00:03:12,051 --> 00:03:13,569
THE WORLD HAS EVER KNOWN

53
00:03:13,569 --> 00:03:16,097
AND WE ALL KNOW WHAT THAT
THREAT IS.

54
00:03:16,097 --> 00:03:18,913
>> LATE NIGHT TV.

55
00:03:18,913 --> 00:03:22,525
WELL, HELLO, GOOD TO BE HERE.

56
00:03:22,525 --> 00:03:25,838
YES, IT'S ME, YOUR FAVORITE
PRESIDENT.

57
00:03:25,838 --> 00:03:28,222
I'M LIKE THE LATE, GREAT
BEETLEJUICE.

58
00:03:28,222 --> 00:03:31,697
YOU SAY
MY NAME ZERO TIMES AND I APPEAR.

59
00:03:31,697 --> 00:03:34,890
I'M JUST HERE KEEPING AN EYE ON SNL

60
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:37,870
MAKING SURE THEY DON'T DO
ANYTHING TOO MEAN ABOUT ME.

61
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:39,383
THEY BETTER BE CAREFUL,

62
00:03:39,383 --> 00:03:43,891
I KNOW LATE NIGHT
TV LIKE THE BACK OF MY HANDS,

63
00:03:43,891 --> 00:03:46,345
NOT LOOKING GREAT RIGHT NOW.

64
00:03:46,455 --> 00:03:47,777
DON'T LOOK AT THAT.

65
00:03:47,777 --> 00:03:50,728
GOING TO COVER THIS UP FOR THE
REST OF MY LIFE.

66
00:03:50,728 --> 00:03:53,639
SNL 51 ALREADY OFF TO A ROUGH
START.

67
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:55,806
17 NEW CAST MEMBERS

68
00:03:55,806 --> 00:03:58,931
AND THEY GOT
THE UPDATE GUY DOING THE OPEN.

69
00:03:58,931 --> 00:04:02,026
WOW, LOOK AT COLIN, POOR COLIN.

70
00:04:02,026 --> 00:04:05,931
WE ALL KNOW THEY WERE NEVER
GOING TO LET HIM DO THE WHOLE
OPENING BY HIMSELF.

71
00:04:05,931 --> 00:04:09,785
CAN'T EVEN DO UPDATE BY HIMSELF,
HE NEEDS MICHAEL CHE.

72
00:04:09,785 --> 00:04:11,731
I NEED MY CHE.

73
00:04:11,731 --> 00:04:14,017
FRANKLY I'M SURPRISED COLIN'S HERE,

74
00:04:14,017 --> 00:04:18,274
I THOUGHT HE WOULD BE WITH
HIS FRIENDS AT THE RIYADH COMEDY
FESTIVAL.

75
00:04:18,274 --> 00:04:20,828
>> I DIDN'T GET AN OFFER.

76
00:04:20,828 --> 00:04:24,285
>> THAT'S SAD.
WE LOVE THE SAUDIS

77
00:04:24,285 --> 00:04:27,440
BECAUSE THEY
LIKE TO SAW THESE JOURNALISTS IN
HALF.

78
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,868
THAT'S THE KIND OF THING THAT
WOULD KILL OVER THERE.

79
00:04:29,868 --> 00:04:31,307
ALL RIGHT, COLIN,

80
00:04:31,307 --> 00:04:34,905
THOSE SPIRIT AIRLINES JOKES
AREN'T GOING TO WRITE
THEMSELVES.

81
00:04:34,905 --> 00:04:36,139
BYE.

82
00:04:36,139 --> 00:04:41,630
OH, AND COLIN, MAY EVERY DAY BE
ANOTHER WONDERFUL SECRET.

83
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:44,383
THAT WAS A QUOTE FROM A POEM

84
00:04:44,383 --> 00:04:47,121
I WROTE TO A
HORRIBLE MAN I'VE NEVER MET
BEFORE.

85
00:04:47,121 --> 00:04:50,837
BUT HERE WE ARE, "SNL" SEASON 51,

86
00:04:50,837 --> 00:04:53,343
SHOULD HAVE CALLED IT AT 50,
RIGHT?

87
00:04:53,343 --> 00:04:56,371
IT'S SO SAD TO SEE SOMETHING GET
OLD AND CONFUSED

88
00:04:56,371 --> 00:04:59,306
YET STILL
DEMAND CONSTANT ATTENTION.

89
00:04:59,306 --> 00:05:00,949
OH, WELL.

90
00:05:00,949 --> 00:05:04,373
BUT THEY BETTER BE ON THEIR BEST
BEHAVIOR, OTHERWISE THEY'RE
GOING TO HAVE TO ANSWER

91
00:05:04,373 --> 00:05:09,421
TO MY
ATTACK DOG AT THE FCC, BRANDON
CARR.

92
00:05:16,368 --> 00:05:20,369
ALL RIGHT.
THANKS BRANDON.

93
00:05:23,206 --> 00:05:25,733
>> IT'S ACTUALLY BRENDAN, SIR.

94
00:05:25,733 --> 00:05:28,959
>> IT'S CRAZY THAT YOU THINK I
CARE.
BYE.

95
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:30,995
YOU GOT TO STOP.

96
00:05:30,995 --> 00:05:33,193
WELL, I HAD A GREAT SUMMER,

97
00:05:33,193 --> 00:05:36,042
I TOOK A LITTLE VACATION TIME
FOR GOLF AND TRAVEL

98
00:05:36,042 --> 00:05:37,771
AND STROKE.

99
00:05:37,771 --> 00:05:38,840
KIDDING.

100
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:41,313
OR NOT.
WE'LL NEVER KNOW, WILL WE?

101
00:05:41,313 --> 00:05:46,162
WHAT ELSE, I ENDED EVERY WAR,

102
00:05:46,162 --> 00:05:50,381
EXCEPT THE TWO MAIN ONES STILL
HAPPENING AND MORE VICIOUS THAN
EVER.

103
00:05:50,381 --> 00:05:55,356
NOW STARTING A NEW WAR IN
VENEZUELA SOON,

104
00:05:55,356 --> 00:05:59,756
THAT'S VERY
EXCITING AND THEY ASK HOW ARE
YOU GOING TO WAY FOR ALL THIS,

105
00:05:59,756 --> 00:06:02,552
AND I TELL THEM,
WITH MY SCAMS.

106
00:06:02,552 --> 00:06:05,214
MY BEAUTIFUL SCAMS.

107
00:06:05,214 --> 00:06:09,122
OUR NEXT ONE IS TRUMPRX, MY OWN
PHARMACY.

108
00:06:09,122 --> 00:06:11,891
LIKE
WE'VE GOT EVERYTHING,

109
00:06:11,891 --> 00:06:15,428
HAIR PILLS, BONER PILLS, END OF LIST.

110
00:06:15,428 --> 00:06:19,395
I GUESS I'LL LET THEM START THE
SHOW.
THE CREW IS READY TO GO.

111
00:06:19,395 --> 00:06:23,028
THANK YOU "SNL" CREW FOR YOUR
HARD WORK AND YOUR VOTES.

112
00:06:23,028 --> 00:06:27,830
KEEP AN EYE ON MARCELLO FOR ME,
RIGHT?

113
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:30,699
GOOD, FANTASTIC.

114
00:06:30,699 --> 00:06:34,528
HERE WE GO,
AND JUST REMEMBER, DADDY'S
WATCHING,

115
00:06:34,528 --> 00:06:38,792
AND LIVE FROM
NEW YORK, IT'S SATURDAY NIGHT!

116
00:08:41,505 --> 00:08:45,347
MUSICAL GUEST DOJA CAT,

117
00:08:46,393 --> 00:08:50,318
AND YOUR HOST, BAD BUNNY!

118
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:59,076
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, BAD BUNNY!

119
00:09:22,801 --> 00:09:26,665
THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU,

120
00:09:26,665 --> 00:09:28,720
IT'S SO GOOD TO BE BACK.

121
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,541
THIS IS MY SECOND TIME HOSTING

122
00:09:32,541 --> 00:09:35,896
AND
MY FOURTH TIME BEING HERE.

123
00:09:35,896 --> 00:09:37,916
AND I THINK MARCELLO IS GETTING NERVOUS

124
00:09:37,916 --> 00:09:41,314
THAT LORNE HAS A NEW
FAVORITE LATINO.

125
00:09:42,363 --> 00:09:44,707
>> I AM.

126
00:09:45,154 --> 00:09:49,523
>> THIS TIME I'M ONLY HOSTING
BECAUSE I NEED A REST.

127
00:09:49,523 --> 00:09:55,108
I JUST FINISHED A 31-SHOW
RESIDENCY IN PUERTO RICO

128
00:09:56,770 --> 00:10:03,135
AND I'M
STILL KIND OF TIRED BECAUSE THE
SHOWS ARE THREE HOURS LONG

129
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:08,910
AND
THERE'S A LOT OF COMPLICATED
CHOREOGRAPHY, LIKE THIS.

130
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:19,715
THAT LOOKED
SIMPLE, BUT

131
00:10:19,715 --> 00:10:23,719
THAT TOOK ME A LONG
TIME TO LEARN.
TRUST ME.

132
00:10:23,719 --> 00:10:28,222
ANYWAYS, MY RESIDENCY WAS
BEAUTIFUL, EVERYONE LOVED IT.

133
00:10:28,222 --> 00:10:30,959
SOME CELEBRITIES CAME TO MY
SHOW.

134
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:35,297
FEW OF THEM WERE ON DRUGS.

135
00:10:35,765 --> 00:10:38,560
AND I DON'T WANT TO SAY WHO,

136
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:42,732
BUT THIS WAS JON HAMM.

137
00:10:47,779 --> 00:10:52,168
ACTUALLY, ACTUALLY, THAT WASN'T JON HAMM,

138
00:10:52,168 --> 00:10:55,519
THAT WAS JUAN JAMON.

139
00:11:03,597 --> 00:11:07,357
I THINK HE'S OBSESSED WITH ME.

140
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:11,308
ANYWAY, YOU MIGHT NOT KNOW THIS,

141
00:11:11,308 --> 00:11:15,905
BUT I'M DOING THE SUPER BOWL
HALFTIME SHOW.

142
00:11:18,628 --> 00:11:22,890
AND I'M VERY HAPPY,

143
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:25,848
AND I THINK EVERYONE IS HAPPY ABOUT IT.

144
00:11:27,441 --> 00:11:31,730
EVEN FOX NEWS.

145
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:33,067
>> BAD BUNNY.
>> IS.

146
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:34,377
>> MY FAVORITE.
>> MUSICIAN.

147
00:11:34,377 --> 00:11:37,232
>> AND HE SHOULD BE THE NEXT.
>> PRESIDENT.

148
00:11:38,684 --> 00:11:42,159
>> WOW, THANK YOU.

149
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:46,423
NO, REALLY, I'M VERY EXCITED TO
BE DOING THE SUPER BOWL.

150
00:11:46,423 --> 00:11:49,029
AND I KNOW THAT PEOPLE ALL
AROUND THE WORLD

151
00:11:49,029 --> 00:11:52,297
WHO LOVE MY
MUSIC ARE ALSO HAPPY.

152
00:11:52,297 --> 00:11:55,225
LATINO

153
00:11:57,244 --> 00:12:00,953
TERO

154
00:12:00,953 --> 00:12:05,792
PUENTAS

155
00:12:05,792 --> 00:12:08,319
MIO

156
00:12:09,589 --> 00:12:14,621

00:21:08,434 --> 00:21:13,404
WONDERING WHY WE INVITED YOU TO

314
00:21:13,406 --> 00:21:14,338
DINNER TONIGHT.

315
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:15,439
>> YEAH, I GUESS I WAS CURIOUS.

316
00:21:15,441 --> 00:21:16,507
>> KATIE AND I HAD SOMETHING

317
00:21:16,509 --> 00:21:17,608
KIND OF IMPORTANT WE WANTED TO

318
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:19,210
ASK YOU.

319
00:21:19,212 --> 00:21:21,879
>> OBVIOUSLY YOU KNOW WE'VE BEEN

320
00:21:21,881 --> 00:21:22,947
TOGETHER A WHILE AND RECENTLY

321
00:21:22,949 --> 00:21:25,149
WE'VE STARTED TO THINK ABOUT

322
00:21:25,151 --> 00:21:26,217
HAVING A BABY.

323
00:21:26,219 --> 00:21:27,818
>> AND YOU'RE ONE OF OUR BEST

324
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:28,853
FRIENDS AND WE BOTH LOVE YOU.

325
00:21:28,855 --> 00:21:31,589
WE WERE WONDERING IF YOU WOULD

326
00:21:31,591 --> 00:21:32,657
BE OUR DONOR.

327
00:21:32,659 --> 00:21:34,291
>> OH, WOW, I WASN'T EXPECTING

328
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:35,326
THAT.

329
00:21:35,328 --> 00:21:36,961
>> SORRY, I HOPE YOU DON'T FEEL

330
00:21:36,963 --> 00:21:39,096
LIKE WE'RE AMBUSHING YOU.

331
00:21:39,098 --> 00:21:40,164
>> NO, NOT AT ALL, I'M HONORED.

332
00:21:40,166 --> 00:21:41,766
IT'S A REALLY BIG DECISION, IS

333
00:21:41,768 --> 00:21:44,535
IT OKAY IF I THINK IT OVER?

334
00:21:44,537 --> 00:21:44,969
>> OF COURSE.

335
00:21:44,971 --> 00:21:48,339
>> PLEASE,

336
00:21:48,341 --> 00:21:51,008
TAKE YOUR TIME.

337
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:54,278
>> I WILL DO IT?

338
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:57,481
>> I'M SORRY?

339
00:21:57,483 --> 00:21:59,083
>> I SAID I WILL DO IT.

340
00:21:59,085 --> 00:22:01,852
IF HE DOESN'T WANT TO DO THAT OR

341
00:22:01,854 --> 00:22:07,091
HE FORGETS HOW TO GET IT OUT.

342
00:22:07,093 --> 00:22:08,125
>> I KNOW HOW TO GET IT OUT.

343
00:22:08,127 --> 00:22:09,160
THANK YOU.

344
00:22:09,162 --> 00:22:11,328
>> MAN, WE DON'T KNOW YOU.

345
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:16,133
>> WELL, MY NAME IS ELVIRO

346
00:22:16,135 --> 00:22:17,168
GUTIERREZ, AND ONE FUN FACT

347
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:20,938
ABOUT ME IS I THINK THE ENDING

348
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:22,039
OF "SOPRANOS" WAS PERFECT.

349
00:22:22,041 --> 00:22:24,709
>> NICE TO MEET YOU, ELVIRO, BUT

350
00:22:24,711 --> 00:22:26,277
THIS IS A PRIVATE CONVERSATION.

351
00:22:26,279 --> 00:22:27,378
>> MY MISTAKE, JUST TRYING TO

352
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:30,614
HELP.

353
00:22:30,616 --> 00:22:31,649
>> GREAT.

354
00:22:31,651 --> 00:22:32,717
ANYWAYS, MATT, WE REALLY THINK

355
00:22:32,719 --> 00:22:33,751
YOU WOULD BE THE PERFECT DONOR

356
00:22:33,753 --> 00:22:36,053
FOR US, BUT SERIOUSLY, THERE'S

357
00:22:36,055 --> 00:22:37,021
NO PRESSURE.

358
00:22:37,023 --> 00:22:42,259
>> DO YOU MIND IF I STEP OUTSIDE

359
00:22:42,261 --> 00:22:45,496
AND CALL JEN?

360
00:22:45,498 --> 00:22:47,331
I THINK A BIG DECISION LIKE

361
00:22:47,333 --> 00:22:48,065
THAT, MY FIANCE SHOULD WEIGH IN.

362
00:22:48,067 --> 00:22:48,499
>> OF COURSE.

>> WHATEVER YOU NEED.

364
00:22:49,469 --> 00:22:51,736
>> IF MATT SAYS NO, WE CAN

365
00:22:51,738 --> 00:22:55,573
ALWAYS GO BACK TO THE CLINIC.

366
00:22:55,575 --> 00:23:00,411
>> IT'S JUST SO EXPENSIVE.

367
00:23:00,413 --> 00:23:03,114
>> I COULD GIVE YOU SOME.

368
00:23:03,116 --> 00:23:04,148
>> WHAT?

369
00:23:04,150 --> 00:23:08,953

AND THEN YOU COULD DO WHATEVER

374
00:23:12,959 --> 00:23:14,458

YOU CAN PUT IN THE FRONT, YOU

376
00:23:15,461 --> 00:23:15,993

IT'S UP TO YOU.

378
00:23:17,063 --> 00:23:18,095
>> YEAH, WE'RE OKAY.

379
00:23:18,097 --> 00:23:20,331
>> WE DON'T KNOW YOU AND WE

380
00:23:20,333 --> 00:23:23,534
DON'T NEED YOUR RANDOM SPERM.

381
00:23:23,536 --> 00:23:26,737
>> I'LL TAKE IT.

382
00:23:26,739 --> 00:23:29,406

OPENS A WINDOW, YOU TAKE THE

387

SO WHO WILL CARRY MY BABY.

391
00:23:48,494 --> 00:23:49,560
I HOPE NOT THIS ONE.

392
00:23:49,562 --> 00:23:50,628
>> WHAT?

393

>> NO ONE IS CARRYING YOUR BABY.

394
00:23:53,166 --> 00:23:54,431

>> I'M COLIN JOST.

680
00:35:25,523 --> 00:35:28,225
GOVERNMENT FINALLY REPRESENTED

681
00:35:33,698 --> 00:35:36,399
THE PEOPLE WHEN IT JUST

682
00:35:36,401 --> 00:35:37,367
COMPLETELY SHUT DOWN.

683
00:35:37,369 --> 00:35:41,204
HONESTLY DIDN'T IT FEEL LIKE THE

684
00:35:41,206 --> 00:35:44,441
GOVERNMENT NEEDED A BREAK?

685
00:35:44,443 --> 00:35:45,175
JUST SO WE COULD ALL CATCH OUR

686
00:35:45,177 --> 00:35:45,508
BREATHS.

687
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:46,576
CAN YOU BELIEVE WE'RE ONLY NINE

688
00:35:46,578 --> 00:35:47,244
MONTHS INTO THIS PRESIDENCY.

689
00:35:47,246 --> 00:35:48,245
THAT MEANS WE ONLY HAVE THREE

690
00:35:48,247 --> 00:35:51,948
MONTHS AND SEVEN YEARS

691
00:35:51,950 --> 00:35:55,018
REMAINING.

692
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:55,719
I ALREADY TRIED FIGHTING, I'M

693
00:35:55,721 --> 00:35:56,052
TIRED.

694
00:35:56,054 --> 00:35:56,553
I WENT TO SO MANY

695
00:35:56,555 --> 00:35:57,487
PROTESTS THIS SUMMER, BUT IT WAS

696
00:35:57,489 --> 00:35:58,154
FINALLY WORTH IT BECAUSE WE

697
00:35:58,156 --> 00:36:02,325
FINALLY GOT THEM TO CHANGE THE

698
00:36:02,327 --> 00:36:05,028
CRACKER BARREL LOGO BACK TO MY

699
00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:07,797
ACTUAL GRANDPA.

700
00:36:07,799 --> 00:36:09,165
I KNOW IT'S SCARY FOR A LOT OF

701
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:10,200
PEOPLE RIGHT NOW, BUT I'M TRYING

702
00:36:10,202 --> 00:36:12,636
TO STAY POSITIVE AND REMEMBER

703
00:36:12,638 --> 00:36:13,770
THE WORDS OF A GREAT MAN.

704
00:36:13,772 --> 00:36:16,973
>> NOTHING BAD CAN HAPPEN, IT

705
00:36:16,975 --> 00:36:18,241
CAN ONLY GOOD HAPPEN.

706
00:36:18,243 --> 00:36:18,875
>> THE LAST TIME THE U.S.

707
00:36:18,877 --> 00:36:20,377
GOVERNMENT

708
00:36:20,379 --> 00:36:21,978
SHUT DOWN WAS DURING PRESIDENT

709
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:24,881
TRUMP'S FIRST ADMINISTRATION IN

710
00:36:24,883 --> 00:36:27,384
2018, WHICH WAS SO LONG AGO THAT

711
00:36:27,386 --> 00:36:29,052
WE LOOKED LIKE THIS.

712
00:36:29,054 --> 00:36:30,587
PRESIDENT TRUMP CLAIMED THAT ONE

713
00:36:30,589 --> 00:36:33,790
OF THE REASONS THE GOVERNMENT

714
00:36:33,792 --> 00:36:35,959
SHUT DOWN IS BECAUSE DEMOCRATS

715
00:36:35,961 --> 00:36:37,594
WANT TRANSGENDER FOR EVERYBODY.

716
00:36:37,596 --> 00:36:40,497
WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY NOT TRUE, BUT

717
00:36:40,499 --> 00:36:45,435
AT THE SAME TIME, I WOULDN'T SAY

718
00:36:45,437 --> 00:36:50,473
NO MY OWN SET OF THESE.

719
00:36:50,475 --> 00:36:51,308
GOT TO WEAR THEM.

720
00:36:51,310 --> 00:36:52,342
>> ISRAEL AND HAMAS HAVE

721
00:36:52,344 --> 00:36:53,076
TENTATIVELY AGREED TO PRESIDENT

722
00:36:53,078 --> 00:36:53,977
TRUMP'S PLAN TO END THE WAR IN

723
00:36:53,979 --> 00:36:55,045
GAZA.

724
00:36:55,047 --> 00:37:02,752
AND YOU COULD TELL THAT TRUMP

725
00:37:02,754 --> 00:37:03,353
WROTE THE PLAN HIMSELF.

726
00:37:03,355 --> 00:37:04,354
>> A TRUMP ADVISER SAID I.C.E.

727
00:37:04,356 --> 00:37:05,455
AGENTS WILL ATTEND THE SUPER

728
00:37:05,457 --> 00:37:06,089
BOWL AFTER BAD BUNNY WAS

729
00:37:06,091 --> 00:37:07,090
ANNOUNCED AS THE HALFTIME

730
00:37:07,092 --> 00:37:08,291
PERFORMER.

731
00:37:08,293 --> 00:37:09,726
YOU KNOW, TO CATCH ALL THOSE

732
00:37:09,728 --> 00:37:14,798
FARM WORKERS WHO CAN AFFORD

733
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,933
SUPER BOWL TICKETS.

734
00:37:16,935 --> 00:37:17,600
THE FDA QUIETLY APPROVED THE

735
00:37:17,602 --> 00:37:18,435
GENERIC ABORTION PILL JUST

736
00:37:18,437 --> 00:37:19,502
BEFORE THE SHUTDOWN.

737
00:37:19,504 --> 00:37:20,637
I DON'T HAVE A JOKE BUT WHENEVER

738
00:37:20,639 --> 00:37:34,217
I MENTION A PRODUCT ON AIR THEY

739
00:37:34,219 --> 00:37:35,852
SEND ME A BOX FOR FREE.

740
00:37:35,854 --> 00:37:38,888
>> PRESIDENT TRUMP ALSO SPOKE TO

741
00:37:38,890 --> 00:37:41,958
A GROUP OF MILITARY LEADERS THIS

742
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:44,027
WEEK, AT ONE POINT WENT ON A

743
00:37:44,029 --> 00:37:45,595
LONG RANT HOW GOOD BARACK OBAMA

744
00:37:45,597 --> 00:37:48,264
WAS WALKING DOWN THE STAIRS.

745
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:49,699
I'M NOT GOING TO READ IT, IT WAS

746
00:37:49,701 --> 00:37:52,268
CRAZY TO HEAR FROM A PRESIDENT

747
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:53,336
BUT FUN FROM ANYONE ELSE.

748
00:37:53,338 --> 00:37:54,070
LET ME SHOW YOU WHAT I MEAN IN

749
00:37:54,072 --> 00:37:54,804
OUR NEW SEGMENT, PRESIDENT TRUMP

750
00:37:54,806 --> 00:37:55,538
WOULD MAKE A LOT MORE SENSE IF

751
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:58,008
HE SOUNDED LIKE JENNIFER

752
00:37:58,010 --> 00:38:00,577
COOLIDGE.

753
00:38:00,579 --> 00:38:03,947
>> BE COOL.

754
00:38:03,949 --> 00:38:04,681
BE COOL WHEN YOU WALK DOWN BUT

755
00:38:04,683 --> 00:38:05,248
DON'T DOWN THE STAIRS.

756
00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:08,551
ONE THING WITH OBAMA, I HAVE

757
00:38:08,553 --> 00:38:11,087
ZERO RESPECT FOR HIM AS A

758
00:38:11,089 --> 00:38:13,656
PRESIDENT, BUT HE WOULD BOP DOWN

759
00:38:13,658 --> 00:38:14,924
THOSE STAIRS.

760
00:38:14,926 --> 00:38:16,559
BA DUMB, BABA.

761
00:38:16,561 --> 00:38:17,660
>> THIS HAS BEEN PRESIDENT TRUMP

762
00:38:17,662 --> 00:38:18,395
WOULD MAKE A LOT MORE SENSE IF

763
00:38:18,397 --> 00:38:19,262
HE SOUNDED LIKE JENNIFER

764
00:38:19,264 --> 00:38:22,632
COOLIDGE.

765
00:38:22,634 --> 00:38:24,567
>> SEAN COMBS WAS SENTENCED

766
00:38:24,569 --> 00:38:25,235
ON FRIDAY TO FOUR YEARS IN

767
00:38:25,237 --> 00:38:26,236
PRISON.

768
00:38:26,238 --> 00:38:26,703
I'LL BE HONEST,

769
00:38:26,705 --> 00:38:27,404
IT'S HARD TO WATCH SOMEONE I

770
00:38:27,406 --> 00:38:38,114
LOVE GET PUNISHED, BUT THAT'S

771
00:38:38,116 --> 00:38:40,617
WHAT DIDDY WOULD DO.

772
00:38:40,619 --> 00:38:43,053
DURING SEAN COMBS' SENTENCING,

773
00:38:43,055 --> 00:38:43,753
HE PLEADED FOR MERCY, SAYING

774
00:38:43,755 --> 00:38:44,087
THAT THE

775
00:38:44,089 --> 00:38:44,821
THINGS HE DID WERE DISGUSTING,

776
00:38:44,823 --> 00:38:45,755
SHAMEFUL AND SICK, IN FACT JUST

777
00:38:45,757 --> 00:38:52,495
THINKING ABOUT THEM MAKES HIM

778
00:38:52,497 --> 00:38:54,397
HARDER THAN GRANDMA'S CANDY.

779
00:38:54,399 --> 00:38:55,532
>> THEY SHOWED THE CANDY.

780
00:38:55,534 --> 00:38:58,301
>> IT'S HARD CANDY.

781
00:38:58,303 --> 00:38:59,335
>> YEAH, HARD CANDY.

782
00:38:59,337 --> 00:39:00,937
>> IT WAS REPORTED THAT ELON

BILLION.

786

WOW, SHOUT-OUT TO TYLENOL.

787
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:16,619
>> NEW YORK MAYOR ERIC ADAMS HAS

788
00:39:16,621 --> 00:39:17,287
ENDED HIS RE-ELECTION BID,

789

CITING AN OFFICIAL

790

00:45:48,146 --> 00:45:49,445
AND WHEN CHO CHANG WAS -- HMM,

991
00:45:49,447 --> 00:45:49,979
WAS CHO CHANG ASIAN?

992
00:45:49,981 --> 00:45:53,749
DOBBY CAN'T REMEMBER IF THE

993
00:45:53,751 --> 00:45:54,617
CHARACTER NAMED CHO CHANG WAS

994
00:45:54,619 --> 00:45:57,019
ASIAN OR NOT.

995
00:45:57,021 --> 00:45:59,021
>> ALL RIGHT, DOBBY, WE GET IT.

996
00:45:59,023 --> 00:46:02,058
>> THE POINT IS, DOBBY CAME HERE

997
00:46:02,060 --> 00:46:03,860
TO SAY THAT WOMEN HAVE VAGINAS

998
00:46:03,862 --> 00:46:07,630
AND WOMEN'S BATHROOMS ARE FOR

999
00:46:07,632 --> 00:46:08,364
WOMEN ONLY AND GIRLS AND GHOSTS

1000
00:46:08,366 --> 00:46:09,465
OF GIRLS.

1001
00:46:09,467 --> 00:46:15,571
>> I DON'T EVEN GET THAT BECAUSE

1002
00:46:15,573 --> 00:46:16,239
I NEVER READ THEM CORNY ASS

1003
00:46:16,241 --> 00:46:18,441
BOOKS.

1004
00:46:18,443 --> 00:46:21,344
>> OF COURSE SIR, DOBBY NEVER

1005
00:46:21,346 --> 00:46:22,111
MEANT TO IMPLY THAT MR. CHE IS

1006
00:46:22,113 --> 00:46:26,516
UNCOOL.

1007
00:46:26,518 --> 00:46:35,591
>> IT'S FINE.

1008
00:46:35,593 --> 00:46:40,763
HE'S VERY COOL, HE GOES TO STRIP

1009
00:46:40,765 --> 00:46:41,364
CLUBS AND YANKEES GAMES.

1010
00:46:41,366 --> 00:46:41,797
UNLIKE DOBBY.

1011
00:46:41,799 --> 00:46:42,465
OH, NO, DOBBY IS MILLENNIAL

1012
00:46:42,467 --> 00:46:42,798
CRINGE!

1013
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:43,399
OH, NO!

1014
00:46:43,401 --> 00:46:45,635
BAD DOBBY, BAD DOBBY!

00:46:45,637 --> 00:46:49,739
CRINGE DOBBY!

1016
00:46:49,741 --> 00:46:50,406
>> WHY DO YOU KEEP HURTING

1017
00:46:50,408 --> 00:46:50,773
YOURSELF?

1018
00:46:50,775 --> 00:46:51,240
IT'S NOT RIGHT.

1019
00:46:51,242 --> 00:46:51,974
>> WHY DOES DOBBY HURT HIMSELF?

1020
00:46:51,976 --> 00:46:54,877
DOBBY DOESN'T KNOW.

1021
00:46:54,879 --> 00:46:57,847
PERHAPS THAT'S WHAT HOUSE ELVES

1022
00:46:57,849 --> 00:47:02,118
WERE TAUGHT WE'RE ALWAYS THE

00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:02,852
PROBLEM, EVEN AS A 10th OF THE

1024
00:47:02,854 --> 00:47:03,252
POPULATION.

1025
00:47:03,254 --> 00:47:05,888
BUT WE'RE NOT

1026
00:47:05,890 --> 00:47:11,761

1031
00:47:19,304 --> 00:47:20,136
>> HEY, DOBBY, I HAVE READ THE

1032
00:47:20,138 --> 00:47:20,536
BOOKS.

1033
00:47:20,538 --> 00:47:21,571
>> OF COURSE YOU HAVE.

1034
00:47:21,573 --> 00:47:22,838

1035
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:26,442
PIECE OF CLOTHING, DOESN'T THAT

1036
00:47:26,444 --> 00:47:28,044
MEAN YOU'RE FREE?

1037
00:47:28,046 --> 00:47:30,179
>> YOU MEAN, DOBBY IS FINALLY

1038
00:47:30,181 --> 00:47:32,315
FREE TO SAY WHATEVER CHO/CHANG

1039
00:47:32,317 --> 00:47:33,382
THINKS?

1040
00:47:33,384 --> 00:47:36,052

1043
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,032
SOMETHING TO SAY.

1044
00:47:50,034 --> 00:47:50,733
GRINDLEWALD'S WORST CRIME WAS

1045
00:47:50,735 --> 00:47:52,868
SODOMY.

1046
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:53,469
>> DOBBY THE HOUSE ELF,

1047
00:47:53,471 --> 00:47:55,237

FOR WEEKEND

1049
00:48:27,070 --> 00:48:32,108
AND THEIR OWN LANGUAGE EMERGES

1050
00:48:32,110 --> 00:48:32,475
TO

1051
00:48:32,477 --> 00:48:33,209
UNITE THEIR PEOPLE WITH A COMMON

1052
00:48:33,211 --> 00:48:34,043
TONGUE.

1053

SPANISH, IS COMING ALONG REALLY

1055

>> SO FAR, LOOKING GOOD.

1057
00:48:44,789 --> 00:48:50,092
>> BUT I WAS THINKING, WHAT IF

1058
00:48:50,094 --> 00:48:52,328
WE MADE IT HARDER TO LEARN.

1059
00:48:52,330 --> 00:48:55,731
SO I HAD AN AMAZING IDEA.

1060
00:48:55,733 --> 00:48:56,132
>> TELL US.

1061
00:48:56,134 --> 00:48:57,333
>> TELL US.

1062
00:48:57,335 --> 00:49:00,036
>> EVERY WORD IS A BOY OR A

1063
00:49:00,038 --> 00:49:04,306

1064
00:49:04,308 --> 00:49:05,908

>> THE FIRST WORD IS MORNING.

1070
00:49:22,326 --> 00:49:28,330
MORNING IS A GIRL.

1071
00:49:28,332 --> 00:49:30,166
LA MANANA.

1072
00:49:30,168 --> 00:49:32,835

>> THE NEXT WORD IS OCEAN.

1081
00:49:48,886 --> 00:49:52,121
OCEAN IS A BOY.

1082
00:49:52,123 --> 00:49:54,824
EL OCEANO.

1083
00:49:54,826 --> 00:49:55,925
>> THE OCEAN IS A BOY BECAUSE

1084
00:49:55,927 --> 00:49:58,594
IT'S FUN BUT SOMETIMES FOR NO

00:50:16,447 --> 00:50:18,080
>> UM, EXCUSE ME.

1093
00:50:18,082 --> 00:50:21,317

>> YES, FROM BARCELONA.

1096
00:50:27,759 --> 00:50:29,358
I'M SO SORRY, I'M SLIGHTLY

00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:33,996
UNRELATED BUT I'M HAVING TROUBLE

00:50:33,998 --> 00:50:36,132
SAYING SOME OF THESE WORDS.

1099
00:50:36,134 --> 00:50:38,667
>> THAT'S BECAUSE YOUR TONGUE IS

1100
00:50:38,669 --> 00:50:44,940
TOO FAR OUT OF YOUR MOUTH.

1101
00:50:44,942 --> 00:50:45,641
PUT YOUR TONGUE BACK IN YOUR

1102
00:50:45,643 --> 00:50:46,041
MOUTH!

1103

GOING TO BLOW YOUR MIND.

00:50:48,813 --> 00:50:49,311
THE BIBLE.

1106
00:50:49,313 --> 00:50:50,346
THE BIBLE IS A GIRL.

1107
00:50:50,348 --> 00:50:52,515
>> WHY IS THE BIBLE A GIRL?

1108
00:50:52,517 --> 00:50:55,417
>> BECAUSE IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

1109
00:50:55,419 --> 00:50:56,051
>> YES, AND ALSO BECAUSE

1110
00:50:56,053 --> 00:50:56,519
THE BIBLE,

1111
00:50:56,521 --> 00:50:57,620
EVERYTHING YOU WANT TO DO IT SAY

1112
00:50:57,622 --> 00:50:58,120
NO.

1113
00:50:58,122 --> 00:51:02,358

YES!

1118
00:51:08,166 --> 00:51:09,999
YES!

1119
00:51:10,001 --> 00:51:11,400
>> I AM SORRY, BARCELONA AGAIN,

1120
00:51:11,402 --> 00:51:13,002
BUT I DON'T SEE HOW WE CAN

1121
00:51:13,004 --> 00:51:16,906
REMEMBER ALL OF THIS.

1122
00:51:16,908 --> 00:51:19,975
I THINK WE SHOULD SKIP THIS.

1123
00:51:19,977 --> 00:51:22,812

1124

00:51:23,548 --> 00:51:23,879

ADIOS.

>> EVERYBODY, DON'T WORRY, HE'S

1130
00:51:36,227 --> 00:51:39,962
GOING TO BE FINE.

1131
00:51:39,964 --> 00:51:40,996
>> NO, PLEASE!

1132
00:51:40,998 --> 00:51:42,031

1133
00:51:42,033 --> 00:51:43,666
RULES THAT YOU'LL NEED TO

1134
00:51:43,668 --> 00:51:50,139
REMEMBER FOR SCHOOL BUT WILL BE

1135
00:51:50,141 --> 00:51:59,648
TOTALLY USELESS IN REAL LIFE,

1136
00:51:59,650 --> 00:52:02,952
PLEASE WELCOME MY COUSIN.

1137
00:52:02,954 --> 00:52:05,087
>> HELLO, EVERYONE.

1138
00:52:05,089 --> 00:52:05,688
PLEASE LISTEN CAREFULLY.

1139
00:52:05,690 --> 00:52:13,629
OKAY.

1140
00:52:13,631 --> 00:52:14,296
WE WILL DO ALSO FORMAL AND

1141
00:52:14,298 --> 00:52:18,133
INFORMAL.

1142
00:52:18,135 --> 00:52:18,634
LIKE YOU AND YOU.

1143
00:52:18,636 --> 00:52:21,303
>> OKAY.

1144
00:52:21,305 --> 00:52:26,342
>> WHAT IF THE LETTER R LASTED

1145
00:52:26,344 --> 00:52:29,345
A LONG TIME LIKE RRRRRR?

1146
00:52:29,347 --> 00:52:32,047
>> I LIKE IT.

1147
00:52:32,049 --> 00:52:35,985
IT WILL CAN ALSO BE SEXY,

1148
00:52:35,987 --> 00:52:39,188
LIKE RRRRR.

1149
00:52:39,190 --> 00:52:43,959
>> I LIKE THAT, CAN I TRY?

1150
00:52:43,961 --> 00:52:46,896
WELL, CAN'T DO THAT.

1151
00:52:46,898 --> 00:52:47,596
>> OKAY, ONE LAST THING, NOT

1152
00:52:47,598 --> 00:52:49,999
RELATED TO ANYTHING.

1153
00:52:50,001 --> 00:52:51,000
I THINK WE SHOULD TAKE A NAP IN

1154
00:52:51,002 --> 00:52:52,868
THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY.

1155
00:52:52,870 --> 00:52:55,104

1156
00:52:55,106 --> 00:52:58,007

1157
00:52:58,009 --> 00:52:58,540
