1
00:00:01,551 --> 00:00:04,803
EARLIER

2
00:00:04,803 --> 00:00:07,992
BRILLIANT IDEA TO GATHER ALL OF
OUR NATION'S TOP GENERALS

3
00:00:07,992 --> 00:00:09,662
IN ONE
PLACE AT ONE TIME.

4
00:00:09,662 --> 00:00:11,836
TO THROW OUR ENEMIES OFF THE SCENT,

5
00:00:11,836 --> 00:00:14,993
HE TOLD THEM EXACTLY
WHERE AND WHEN IT WOULD HAPPEN.

6
00:00:14,993 --> 00:00:17,688
WE TAKE YOU TO THIS MEETING NOW.

7
00:00:22,804 --> 00:00:25,187
>> TEN HUT!

8
00:00:25,341 --> 00:00:26,917
WELCOME, GENERALS.

9
00:00:27,099 --> 00:00:31,265
YOU HAVE ALL DEDICATED YOUR
LIVES TO DEFENDING THIS NATION.

10
00:00:31,265 --> 00:00:34,250
AS A REWARD, YOU WILL NOW BE YELLED AT

11
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:36,837
BY A FORMER FOX NEWS
HOST.

12
00:00:36,837 --> 00:00:40,891
PLEASE WELCOME THE SECRETARY OF WAR,

13
00:00:40,891 --> 00:00:43,008
PETE HEGSETH.

14
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:53,788
>> YEAH.

15
00:00:53,788 --> 00:00:55,754
CUT THE CRAP!

16
00:00:57,136 --> 00:00:59,194
LISTEN UP, EVERYONE, OKAY?

17
00:00:59,194 --> 00:01:04,804
I SUMMONED YOU ALL HERE TODAY TO
ADDRESS A SERIOUS PROBLEM.
OKAY?

18
00:01:04,804 --> 00:01:09,006
OUR MILITARY IS GAY
AS HELL.

19
00:01:09,617 --> 00:01:12,763
I'M NOT JUST TALKING ABOUT THE
NAVY.

20
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:17,234
THANKS TO FAILED LIBERAL POLICIES,

21
00:01:17,234 --> 00:01:19,793
OUR ARMY HAS NEVER BEEN GAYER,

22
00:01:19,793 --> 00:01:23,657
AND YET IT'S ALSO
NEVER BEEN FATTER.

23
00:01:23,657 --> 00:01:26,387
MAKE THAT MAKE SENSE.

24
00:01:26,387 --> 00:01:28,855
AM I RIGHT?

25
00:01:31,578 --> 00:01:34,118
YOU ALL ARE FUN.

26
00:01:34,118 --> 00:01:39,498
FROM NOW ON, OUR FIGHTING MEN
AND I GUESS WOMEN

27
00:01:39,498 --> 00:01:43,393
ARE GOING TO
ADHERE TO THE HIGHEST MALE
STANDARDS,

28
00:01:43,393 --> 00:01:47,390
WHICH HAVE BEEN SET
BY OUR PRESIDENT, DONALD TRUMP.

29
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:51,328
6'6".
BUCK 75.

30
00:01:51,328 --> 00:01:54,381
A-CUPS, PERKY,

31
00:01:54,381 --> 00:01:58,794
WITH A DUMPTRUCK
IN THE BACK YOU WOULDN'T EVEN
BELIEVE.

32
00:01:58,794 --> 00:02:01,960
AND HEY, YOU DON'T WANT TO LOSE
THE WEIGHT?

33
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,745
YOU DON'T WANT TO FOLLOW THE
RULES,

34
00:02:03,745 --> 00:02:08,265
NO PROBLEM.
YOU KNOW WHO IS GOING TO WANT
YOUR SICK, TWISTED FAT ASS?

35
00:02:08,265 --> 00:02:09,877
I.C.E.

36
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:14,216
WE HAVE A SIGN-UP SHEET IN THE
HALLWAY, CHECK THEM OUT.

37
00:02:14,216 --> 00:02:19,573
IN HERE WE'RE
DOING ARMY AND ONLY ARMY.

38
00:02:19,573 --> 00:02:22,489
AND WE'RE GOING TO BE DOING IT
IN ONE OF THE BLOODIEST,

39
00:02:22,489 --> 00:02:25,233
WAR-TORN PLACES ON FACE OF THE EARTH --

40
00:02:25,233 --> 00:02:27,891
PORTLAND, OREGON.

41
00:02:28,285 --> 00:02:31,388
NOW BACK TO THE FAT THING.

42
00:02:31,888 --> 00:02:36,907
OUR MILITARY WILL NOW HAVE THE
SAME RULES AS ANY GOOD FRAT
PARTY.

43
00:02:36,907 --> 00:02:39,610
NO FAT CHICKS.

44
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:45,129
IF YOU'RE A FAT DUDE, GODDAMN
IT, YOU BETTER BE FUNNY AS HELL.

45
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:50,634
IN SUMMARY -- THIS IS THE WHOLE MEETING,

46
00:02:50,634 --> 00:02:55,055
NO FUGGOS, NO FATTIES,

47
00:02:55,055 --> 00:02:58,414
NO FACIAL HAIR, NO BODY
HAIR.

48
00:02:58,414 --> 00:03:02,596
JUST HOT, SHREDDED, HAIRLESS MEN

49
00:03:02,596 --> 00:03:06,218
WHO ARE DEFINITELY NOT GAY.

50
00:03:06,218 --> 00:03:08,529
BECAUSE THIS IS SERIOUS.

51
00:03:08,529 --> 00:03:12,051
WE ARE FACING THE
GREATEST THREAT TO FREEDOM AND
DEMOCRACY

52
00:03:12,051 --> 00:03:13,569
THE WORLD HAS EVER KNOWN

53
00:03:13,569 --> 00:03:16,097
AND WE ALL KNOW WHAT THAT
THREAT IS.

54
00:03:16,097 --> 00:03:18,913
>> LATE NIGHT TV.

55
00:03:18,913 --> 00:03:22,525
WELL, HELLO, GOOD TO BE HERE.

56
00:03:22,525 --> 00:03:25,838
YES, IT'S ME, YOUR FAVORITE
PRESIDENT.

57
00:03:25,838 --> 00:03:28,222
I'M LIKE THE LATE, GREAT
BEETLEJUICE.

58
00:03:28,222 --> 00:03:31,697
YOU SAY
MY NAME ZERO TIMES AND I APPEAR.

59
00:03:31,697 --> 00:03:34,890
I'M JUST HERE KEEPING AN EYE ON SNL

60
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:37,870
MAKING SURE THEY DON'T DO
ANYTHING TOO MEAN ABOUT ME.

61
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:39,383
THEY BETTER BE CAREFUL,

62
00:03:39,383 --> 00:03:43,891
I KNOW LATE NIGHT
TV LIKE THE BACK OF MY HANDS,

63
00:03:43,891 --> 00:03:46,345
NOT LOOKING GREAT RIGHT NOW.

64
00:03:46,455 --> 00:03:47,777
DON'T LOOK AT THAT.

65
00:03:47,777 --> 00:03:50,728
GOING TO COVER THIS UP FOR THE
REST OF MY LIFE.

66
00:03:50,728 --> 00:03:53,639
SNL 51 ALREADY OFF TO A ROUGH
START.

67
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:55,806
17 NEW CAST MEMBERS

68
00:03:55,806 --> 00:03:58,931
AND THEY GOT
THE UPDATE GUY DOING THE OPEN.

69
00:03:58,931 --> 00:04:02,026
WOW, LOOK AT COLIN, POOR COLIN.

70
00:04:02,026 --> 00:04:05,931
WE ALL KNOW THEY WERE NEVER
GOING TO LET HIM DO THE WHOLE
OPENING BY HIMSELF.

71
00:04:05,931 --> 00:04:09,785
CAN'T EVEN DO UPDATE BY HIMSELF,
HE NEEDS MICHAEL CHE.

72
00:04:09,785 --> 00:04:11,731
I NEED MY CHE.

73
00:04:11,731 --> 00:04:14,017
FRANKLY I'M SURPRISED COLIN'S HERE,

74
00:04:14,017 --> 00:04:18,274
I THOUGHT HE WOULD BE WITH
HIS FRIENDS AT THE RIYADH COMEDY
FESTIVAL.

75
00:04:18,274 --> 00:04:20,828
>> I DIDN'T GET AN OFFER.

76
00:04:20,828 --> 00:04:24,285
>> THAT'S SAD.
WE LOVE THE SAUDIS

77
00:04:24,285 --> 00:04:27,440
BECAUSE THEY
LIKE TO SAW THESE JOURNALISTS IN
HALF.

78
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,868
THAT'S THE KIND OF THING THAT
WOULD KILL OVER THERE.

79
00:04:29,868 --> 00:04:31,307
ALL RIGHT, COLIN,

80
00:04:31,307 --> 00:04:34,905
THOSE SPIRIT AIRLINES JOKES
AREN'T GOING TO WRITE
THEMSELVES.

81
00:04:34,905 --> 00:04:36,139
BYE.

82
00:04:36,139 --> 00:04:41,630
OH, AND COLIN, MAY EVERY DAY BE
ANOTHER WONDERFUL SECRET.

83
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:44,383
THAT WAS A QUOTE FROM A POEM

84
00:04:44,383 --> 00:04:47,121
I WROTE TO A
HORRIBLE MAN I'VE NEVER MET
BEFORE.

85
00:04:47,121 --> 00:04:50,837
BUT HERE WE ARE, "SNL" SEASON 51,

86
00:04:50,837 --> 00:04:53,343
SHOULD HAVE CALLED IT AT 50,
RIGHT?

87
00:04:53,343 --> 00:04:56,371
IT'S SO SAD TO SEE SOMETHING GET
OLD AND CONFUSED

88
00:04:56,371 --> 00:04:59,306
YET STILL
DEMAND CONSTANT ATTENTION.

89
00:04:59,306 --> 00:05:00,949
OH, WELL.

90
00:05:00,949 --> 00:05:04,373
BUT THEY BETTER BE ON THEIR BEST
BEHAVIOR, OTHERWISE THEY'RE
GOING TO HAVE TO ANSWER

91
00:05:04,373 --> 00:05:09,421
TO MY
ATTACK DOG AT THE FCC, BRANDON
CARR.

92
00:05:16,368 --> 00:05:20,369
ALL RIGHT.
THANKS BRANDON.

93
00:05:23,206 --> 00:05:25,733
>> IT'S ACTUALLY BRENDAN, SIR.

94
00:05:25,733 --> 00:05:28,959
>> IT'S CRAZY THAT YOU THINK I
CARE.
BYE.

95
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:30,995
YOU GOT TO STOP.

96
00:05:30,995 --> 00:05:33,193
WELL, I HAD A GREAT SUMMER,

97
00:05:33,193 --> 00:05:36,042
I TOOK A LITTLE VACATION TIME
FOR GOLF AND TRAVEL

98
00:05:36,042 --> 00:05:37,771
AND STROKE.

99
00:05:37,771 --> 00:05:38,840
KIDDING.

100
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:41,313
OR NOT.
WE'LL NEVER KNOW, WILL WE?

101
00:05:41,313 --> 00:05:46,162
WHAT ELSE, I ENDED EVERY WAR,

102
00:05:46,162 --> 00:05:50,381
EXCEPT THE TWO MAIN ONES STILL
HAPPENING AND MORE VICIOUS THAN
EVER.

103
00:05:50,381 --> 00:05:55,356
NOW STARTING A NEW WAR IN
VENEZUELA SOON,

104
00:05:55,356 --> 00:05:59,756
THAT'S VERY
EXCITING AND THEY ASK HOW ARE
YOU GOING TO WAY FOR ALL THIS,

105
00:05:59,756 --> 00:06:02,552
AND I TELL THEM,
WITH MY SCAMS.

106
00:06:02,552 --> 00:06:05,214
MY BEAUTIFUL SCAMS.

107
00:06:05,214 --> 00:06:09,122
OUR NEXT ONE IS TRUMPRX, MY OWN
PHARMACY.

108
00:06:09,122 --> 00:06:11,891
LIKE
WE'VE GOT EVERYTHING,

109
00:06:11,891 --> 00:06:15,428
HAIR PILLS, BONER PILLS, END OF LIST.

110
00:06:15,428 --> 00:06:19,395
I GUESS I'LL LET THEM START THE
SHOW.
THE CREW IS READY TO GO.

111
00:06:19,395 --> 00:06:23,028
THANK YOU "SNL" CREW FOR YOUR
HARD WORK AND YOUR VOTES.

112
00:06:23,028 --> 00:06:27,830
KEEP AN EYE ON MARCELLO FOR ME,
RIGHT?

113
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:30,699
GOOD, FANTASTIC.

114
00:06:30,699 --> 00:06:34,528
HERE WE GO,
AND JUST REMEMBER, DADDY'S
WATCHING,

115
00:06:34,528 --> 00:06:38,792
AND LIVE FROM
NEW YORK, IT'S SATURDAY NIGHT!

116
00:08:41,505 --> 00:08:45,347
MUSICAL GUEST DOJA CAT,

117
00:08:46,393 --> 00:08:50,318
AND YOUR HOST, BAD BUNNY!

118
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:59,076
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, BAD BUNNY!

119
00:09:22,801 --> 00:09:26,665
THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU,

120
00:09:26,665 --> 00:09:28,720
IT'S SO GOOD TO BE BACK.

121
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,541
THIS IS MY SECOND TIME HOSTING

122
00:09:32,541 --> 00:09:35,896
AND
MY FOURTH TIME BEING HERE.

123
00:09:35,896 --> 00:09:37,916
AND I THINK MARCELLO IS GETTING NERVOUS

124
00:09:37,916 --> 00:09:41,314
THAT LORNE HAS A NEW
FAVORITE LATINO.

125
00:09:42,363 --> 00:09:44,707
>> I AM.

126
00:09:45,154 --> 00:09:49,523
>> THIS TIME I'M ONLY HOSTING
BECAUSE I NEED A REST.

127
00:09:49,523 --> 00:09:55,108
I JUST FINISHED A 31-SHOW
RESIDENCY IN PUERTO RICO

128
00:09:56,770 --> 00:10:03,135
AND I'M
STILL KIND OF TIRED BECAUSE THE
SHOWS ARE THREE HOURS LONG

129
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:08,910
AND
THERE'S A LOT OF COMPLICATED
CHOREOGRAPHY, LIKE THIS.

130
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:19,715
THAT LOOKED
SIMPLE, BUT

131
00:10:19,715 --> 00:10:23,719
THAT TOOK ME A LONG
TIME TO LEARN.
TRUST ME.

132
00:10:23,719 --> 00:10:28,222
ANYWAYS, MY RESIDENCY WAS
BEAUTIFUL, EVERYONE LOVED IT.

133
00:10:28,222 --> 00:10:30,959
SOME CELEBRITIES CAME TO MY
SHOW.

134
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:35,297
FEW OF THEM WERE ON DRUGS.

135
00:10:35,765 --> 00:10:38,560
AND I DON'T WANT TO SAY WHO,

136
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:42,732
BUT THIS WAS JON HAMM.

137
00:10:47,779 --> 00:10:52,168
ACTUALLY, ACTUALLY, THAT WASN'T JON HAMM,

138
00:10:52,168 --> 00:10:55,519
THAT WAS JUAN JAMON.

139
00:11:03,597 --> 00:11:07,357
I THINK HE'S OBSESSED WITH ME.

140
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:11,308
ANYWAY, YOU MIGHT NOT KNOW THIS,

141
00:11:11,308 --> 00:11:15,905
BUT I'M DOING THE SUPER BOWL
HALFTIME SHOW.

142
00:11:18,628 --> 00:11:22,890
AND I'M VERY HAPPY,

143
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:25,848
AND I THINK EVERYONE IS HAPPY ABOUT IT.

144
00:11:27,441 --> 00:11:31,730
EVEN FOX NEWS.

145
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:33,067
>> BAD BUNNY.
>> IS.

146
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:34,377
>> MY FAVORITE.
>> MUSICIAN.

147
00:11:34,377 --> 00:11:37,232
>> AND HE SHOULD BE THE NEXT.
>> PRESIDENT.

148
00:11:38,684 --> 00:11:42,159
>> WOW, THANK YOU.

149
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:46,423
NO, REALLY, I'M VERY EXCITED TO
BE DOING THE SUPER BOWL.

150
00:11:46,423 --> 00:11:49,029
AND I KNOW THAT PEOPLE ALL
AROUND THE WORLD

151
00:11:49,029 --> 00:11:52,297
WHO LOVE MY
MUSIC ARE ALSO HAPPY.

152
00:11:52,297 --> 00:11:55,225
LATINO

153
00:11:57,244 --> 00:12:00,953
TERO

154
00:12:00,953 --> 00:12:05,792
PUENTAS

155
00:12:05,792 --> 00:12:08,319
MIO

156
00:12:09,589 --> 00:12:14,621

00:21:33,945 --> 00:21:37,805
IT'S A REALLY BIG DECISION, IS
IT OKAY IF I THINK IT OVER?

309
00:21:37,805 --> 00:21:40,936
>> OF COURSE.
>> PLEASE,
TAKE YOUR TIME.

310
00:21:43,682 --> 00:21:46,679
>> I WILL DO IT?

311
00:21:47,192 --> 00:21:51,097
>> I'M SORRY?
>> I SAID I WILL DO IT.

312
00:21:51,097 --> 00:21:53,241
IF HE DOESN'T WANT TO DO THAT

313
00:21:53,241 --> 00:21:57,085
OR HE FORGETS HOW TO GET IT OUT.

314
00:21:57,085 --> 00:21:59,682
>> I KNOW HOW TO GET IT OUT.
THANK YOU.

315
00:21:59,682 --> 00:22:02,024
>> MAN, WE DON'T KNOW YOU.

316
00:22:02,024 --> 00:22:05,936
>> WELL, MY NAME IS ELVIRO GUTIERREZ,

317
00:22:05,936 --> 00:22:09,576
AND ONE FUN FACT ABOUT ME IS

318
00:22:09,576 --> 00:22:15,056
I THINK THE ENDING
OF "SOPRANOS" WAS PERFECT.

319
00:22:15,056 --> 00:22:19,891
>> NICE TO MEET YOU, ELVIRO, BUT
THIS IS A PRIVATE CONVERSATION.

320
00:22:19,891 --> 00:22:23,075
>> MY MISTAKE, JUST TRYING TO
HELP.

321
00:22:23,075 --> 00:22:24,729
>> GREAT.

322
00:22:24,729 --> 00:22:28,671
ANYWAYS, MATT, WE REALLY THINK
YOU WOULD BE THE PERFECT DONOR FOR US,

323
00:22:28,671 --> 00:22:30,694
BUT SERIOUSLY, THERE'S
NO PRESSURE.

324
00:22:30,694 --> 00:22:33,585
>> DO YOU MIND IF I STEP OUTSIDE
AND CALL JEN?

325
00:22:33,585 --> 00:22:36,916
I THINK A BIG DECISION LIKE
THAT, MY FIANCE SHOULD WEIGH IN.

326
00:22:36,916 --> 00:22:39,011
>> OF COURSE.
>> WHATEVER YOU NEED.

327
00:22:39,011 --> 00:22:40,494
THANK

328
00:22:40,494 --> 00:22:44,415
>> IF MATT SAYS NO, WE CAN
ALWAYS GO BACK TO THE CLINIC.

329
00:22:44,415 --> 00:22:47,247
>> IT'S JUST SO EXPENSIVE.

330
00:22:49,247 --> 00:22:53,425
>> I COULD GIVE YOU SOME.

331
00:22:56,373 --> 00:23:01,216
>> I SAID, I COULD GIVE YOU SOME
OF MY STUFF.

332
00:23:01,216 --> 00:23:02,459
>> WHAT?
>> YEAH.

333
00:23:02,459 --> 00:23:04,787
AND THEN YOU COULD DO WHATEVER
YOU WANT WITH IT.

334
00:23:04,787 --> 00:23:07,801
YOU CAN PUT IN THE FRONT, YOU
CAN PUT IN THE BACK.

335
00:23:07,801 --> 00:23:10,101
IT'S UP TO YOU.

336
00:23:10,101 --> 00:23:12,060
>> YEAH, WE'RE OKAY.

337
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:16,060
>> WE DON'T KNOW YOU AND WE
DON'T NEED YOUR RANDOM SPERM.

338
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:18,208
>> I'LL TAKE IT.

339
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:24,820
>> WHAT?
>> I SAID I'LL TAKE IT IF YOU'RE
JUST GIVING IT AWAY

340
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:29,286
AS THE SAYING GOES, WHEN GOD
OPENS A WINDOW, YOU TAKE THE
SPERM.

341
00:23:29,286 --> 00:23:33,663
>> NO NOSHS, NO, I WANT TO BE A
FATHER.

342
00:23:33,663 --> 00:23:37,561
SO WHO WILL CARRY MY BABY.

343
00:23:37,561 --> 00:23:40,682
I HOPE NOT THIS ONE.

344
00:23:40,682 --> 00:23:43,976
>> WHAT?
>> NO ONE IS CARRYING YOUR BABY.

345
00:23:43,976 --> 00:23:47,188
>> HEY, GUYS, SO SORRY THAT
CALL TOOK SO LONG.

346
00:23:47,188 --> 00:23:50,889
BUT JEN AND I DISCUSSED IT AND
MY ANSWER IS YES,

347
00:23:50,889 --> 00:23:52,148
I'D LOVE TO BE YOUR DONOR.

348
00:23:52,148 --> 00:23:56,233
>> OH, MY GOD, REALLY?
>> MATT, THAT'S AMAZING.

349
00:23:56,233 --> 00:23:58,989
>> WE COULD MIX IT TOGETHER.

350
00:23:58,989 --> 00:24:02,409
HIS STUFF, MY STUFF --

351
00:24:02,409 --> 00:24:04,043
>> MAYBE MY STUFF AS WELL.

352
00:24:04,043 --> 00:24:07,459
>> YOU KNOW WHAT, MAYBE WE
SHOULD GET OUT OF HERE AND
CELEBRATE.

353
00:24:07,459 --> 00:24:09,928
>> ABSOLUTELY.
>> DEFINITELY.

354
00:24:11,085 --> 00:24:14,735
>> GUESS I'LL NEVER GET TO
FATHER A CHILD.

355
00:24:14,735 --> 00:24:19,960
>> I'M AFRAID SOME PEOPLE ARE
JUST MEANT TO WALK THE EARTH
ALONE.

356
00:24:23,078 --> 00:24:25,390
>> DAD?

357
00:25:03,912 --> 00:25:06,918
CHEERS

>> LIKE FIVE YEARS AT LEAST.

360
00:25:14,125 --> 00:25:17,642
>> WHY IS IT SO HARD TO FIND
TIME TO SEE FRIENDS

361
00:25:17,642 --> 00:25:20,272
OR
EXPERIENCE ANY CULTURE?

362
00:25:20,272 --> 00:25:24,986
>> I'M DYING TO SEE THE NEW PAUL
THOMAS ANDERSON MOVIE "ONE
BATTLE AFTER ANOTHER."

363

>> IT'S SO GOOD, YOU HAVE TO SEE
IT.

364
00:25:27,542 --> 00:25:30,751
>> AND DEL TORO HAS

>> I LIKE "KPOP DEMON HUNTERS."

367
00:25:38,854 --> 00:25:41,205
>> THAT'S SUPPOSED TO BE FUN.

368
00:25:41,205 --> 00:25:44,346
>> YEAH.
HAVE YOU BEEN WATCHING IT WITH
YOUR KIDS?

369
00:25:44,346 --> 00:25:46,939
>> I DON'T HAVE KIDS.

370
00:25:46,939 --> 00:25:49,724
>> OH, OKAY.
THAT'S COOL.

371
00:25:49,724 --> 00:25:51,967
YEAH, IT'S A HUGE PHENOMENON,

372
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:55,675
LIKE EVERY
KID I KNOW IS DRESSING UP LIKE
THE DEMON HUNTERS FOR HALLOWEEN.

373
00:25:55,675 --> 00:25:58,793
>> IT'S ACTUALLY NOT FOR KIDS

374
00:25:58,793 --> 00:26:02,106
BUT FOR SMART ADULTS.

375
00:26:02,106 --> 00:26:05,454
>> RIGHT.
WE CAN JUST CHANGE THE SUBJECT.

376
00:26:05,454 --> 00:26:07,587
DID YOU SEE ANY CONCERTS THIS
SUMMER?

377
00:26:07,587 --> 00:26:10,929
I SAW LADY GAGA AND IT WAS
HONESTLY LIFE CHANGING.

378

THAT'S COOL THOMAS.

381
00:26:20,121 --> 00:26:23,987
>> ACTUALLY, IT'S NOT COOL, DOG.

382
00:26:23,987 --> 00:26:26,889
IN "KPOP DEMON HUNTERS,"

383
00:26:26,889 --> 00:26:30,877
SONGS ARE NOT JUST
SONGS BUT WEAPONS.

384
00:26:30,877 --> 00:26:32,958
>> WEAPONS?

385
00:26:32,958 --> 00:26:38,541

SAVE YOU FROM DEMONS,

BUT THERE'S NO
REASON TO GET UPSET OVER A
MOVIE.

390

YOU THINK IT'S JUST A MOVIE?

392
00:26:59,615 --> 00:27:04,581
IT SAYS AT THE BEGINNING IT'S
BASED ON A TRUE STORY.

393
00:27:04,581 --> 00:27:06,602
>> I DON'T THINK IT DOES.

394
00:27:06,602 --> 00:27:10,969
>> CAN WE JUST STOP TALKING
ABOUT "KPOP DEMON HUNTERS"?

IDEA, STUPID DUMMIES.

00:27:28,149 --> 00:27:30,334
I DON'T CARE IF THEY BELIEVE ME.

GOVERNMENT FINALLY REPRESENTED THE PEOPLE

00:35:27,572 --> 00:35:30,329
WHEN IT JUST
COMPLETELY SHUT DOWN.

543
00:35:30,329 --> 00:35:33,725
HONESTLY DIDN'T IT FEEL LIKE THE
GOVERNMENT NEEDED A BREAK?

544
00:35:33,725 --> 00:35:35,607
JUST SO WE COULD ALL CATCH OUR
BREATHS.

545
00:35:35,607 --> 00:35:39,240
CAN YOU BELIEVE WE'RE ONLY NINE
MONTHS INTO THIS PRESIDENCY.

546
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:43,774
THAT MEANS WE ONLY HAVE THREE
MONTHS AND SEVEN YEARS
REMAINING.

547
00:35:43,774 --> 00:35:46,683
I ALREADY TRIED FIGHTING, I'M
TIRED.

548
00:35:46,683 --> 00:35:48,848
I WENT TO SO MANY PROTESTS THIS SUMMER,

549
00:35:48,848 --> 00:35:51,834
BUT IT WAS
FINALLY WORTH IT BECAUSE WE
FINALLY GOT THEM TO CHANGE

550
00:35:51,834 --> 00:35:55,357

CRACKER BARREL LOGO BACK TO THE ORIGINAL

I KNOW IT'S SCARY FOR A LOT OF
PEOPLE RIGHT NOW,

553
00:36:01,109 --> 00:36:05,239
BUT I'M TRYING
TO STAY POSITIVE AND REMEMBER
THE WORDS OF A GREAT MAN.

554
00:36:05,239 --> 00:36:08,962
>> NOTHING BAD CAN HAPPEN, IT
CAN ONLY GOOD HAPPEN.

555
00:36:10,134 --> 00:36:12,772
>> THE LAST TIME THE U.S.
GOVERNMENT SHUT DOWN

556
00:36:12,772 --> 00:36:16,830
WAS DURING PRESIDENT
TRUMP'S FIRST ADMINISTRATION IN 2018,

557
00:36:16,830 --> 00:36:20,451
WHICH WAS SO LONG AGO THAT
WE LOOKED LIKE THIS.

558
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:26,428
PRESIDENT TRUMP CLAIMED THAT ONE
OF THE REASONS THE GOVERNMENT SHUT DOWN

559
00:36:26,428 --> 00:36:30,158
IS BECAUSE DEMOCRATS
WANT TRANSGENDER FOR EVERYBODY.

560
00:36:30,158 --> 00:36:32,377
WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY NOT TRUE,

561
00:36:32,377 --> 00:36:36,813
BUT AT THE SAME TIME, I WOULDN'T SAY
NO MY OWN SET OF THESE.

562
00:36:38,178 --> 00:36:40,733
GOT TO WEAR THEM.

563
00:36:42,518 --> 00:36:45,805
>> ISRAEL AND HAMAS HAVE
TENTATIVELY AGREED

564
00:36:45,805 --> 00:36:48,731
TO PRESIDENT
TRUMP'S PLAN TO END THE WAR IN
GAZA.

565
00:36:48,731 --> 00:36:52,242
AND YOU COULD TELL THAT TRUMP
WROTE THE PLAN HIMSELF.

566
00:36:54,810 --> 00:36:58,555
>> A TRUMP ADVISER SAID I.C.E.
AGENTS WILL ATTEND THE SUPER BOWL

567
00:36:58,555 --> 00:37:01,925
AFTER BAD BUNNY WAS
ANNOUNCED AS THE HALFTIME
PERFORMER.

568
00:37:01,925 --> 00:37:06,426
YOU KNOW, TO CATCH ALL THOSE
FARM WORKERS WHO CAN AFFORD
SUPER BOWL TICKETS.

569
00:37:06,426 --> 00:37:12,148
THE FDA QUIETLY APPROVED THE
GENERIC ABORTION PILL JUST
BEFORE THE SHUTDOWN.

570
00:37:12,148 --> 00:37:13,694
I DON'T HAVE A JOKE

571
00:37:13,694 --> 00:37:17,971
BUT WHENEVER I MENTION A PRODUCT ON AIR THEY
SEND ME A BOX FOR FREE.

572
00:37:25,831 --> 00:37:29,738
>> PRESIDENT TRUMP ALSO SPOKE TO
A GROUP OF MILITARY LEADERS THIS WEEK,

573
00:37:29,738 --> 00:37:31,786
AT ONE POINT WENT ON A LONG RANT

574
00:37:31,786 --> 00:37:35,741
HOW GOOD BARACK OBAMA
WAS WALKING DOWN THE STAIRS.

575
00:37:35,741 --> 00:37:38,121
I'M NOT GOING TO READ IT,

576
00:37:38,121 --> 00:37:40,911
IT WAS CRAZY TO HEAR FROM A PRESIDENT

577
00:37:40,911 --> 00:37:43,313
BUT FUN FROM ANYONE ELSE.

578
00:37:43,313 --> 00:37:45,286
LET ME SHOW YOU WHAT I MEAN IN
OUR NEW SEGMENT,

579
00:37:45,286 --> 00:37:47,498
PRESIDENT TRUMP
WOULD MAKE A LOT MORE SENSE

580
00:37:47,498 --> 00:37:50,460
IF
HE SOUNDED LIKE JENNIFER
COOLIDGE.

581
00:37:51,827 --> 00:37:54,751
>> BE COOL.
BE COOL WHEN YOU WALK DOWN

582
00:37:54,751 --> 00:37:57,880
BUT
DON'T DOWN THE STAIRS.

583
00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:01,842
ONE THING WITH OBAMA, I HAVE
ZERO RESPECT FOR HIM AS A PRESIDENT,

584
00:38:01,842 --> 00:38:04,628
BUT HE WOULD BOP DOWN
THOSE STAIRS.

585
00:38:06,468 --> 00:38:11,308
>> THIS HAS BEEN PRESIDENT TRUMP
WOULD MAKE A LOT MORE SENSE IF
HE SOUNDED LIKE JENNIFER
COOLIDGE.

586
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:17,564
>> SEAN COMBS WAS SENTENCED
ON FRIDAY TO FOUR YEARS IN
PRISON.

587
00:38:17,564 --> 00:38:21,640
I'LL BE HONEST,
IT'S HARD TO WATCH SOMEONE I
LOVE GET PUNISHED,

588
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:24,455
BUT THAT'S
WHAT DIDDY WOULD DO.

589
00:38:30,381 --> 00:38:34,974
DURING SEAN COMBS' SENTENCING,
HE PLEADED FOR MERCY, SAYING THAT

590
00:38:34,974 --> 00:38:38,231
THE
THINGS HE DID WERE DISGUSTING,
SHAMEFUL AND SICK,

591
00:38:38,231 --> 00:38:42,938
IN FACT JUST
THINKING ABOUT THEM MAKES HIM
HARDER THAN GRANDMA'S CANDY.

592
00:38:44,137 --> 00:38:46,608
>> THEY SHOWED THE CANDY.

593
00:38:46,608 --> 00:38:48,781
>> IT'S HARD CANDY.
>> YEAH, HARD CANDY.

594
00:38:48,781 --> 00:38:52,026
>> IT WAS REPORTED THAT ELON
MUSK HAS BECOME THE FIRST PERSON

595
00:38:52,026 --> 00:38:55,074

BILLION.

596
00:38:55,074 --> 00:38:58,202
WOW, SHOUT-OUT TO TYLENOL.

597
00:39:01,539 --> 00:39:07,904
>> NEW YORK MAYOR ERIC ADAMS HAS
ENDED HIS RE-ELECTION BID,

CITING AN OFFICIAL REASON

599
00:39:11,711 --> 00:39:14,860
OF TOO MUCH SWAGGER FOR
Y'ALL.

600
00:39:15,804 --> 00:39:21,278
KAMALA HARRIS HAS RELEASED A NEW
BOOK THAT EXPLAINS HOW SHE LOST
THE 2024 ELECTION.

601
00:39:21,278 --> 00:39:24,125
IT'S CALLED "I'M A BLACK LADY."

602
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:30,454
>> STILL THINKING ABOUT YOU WITH
THOSE BOOBS.

603

THE DAY OF OJ SIMPSON'S
ACQUITTAL.

604
00:39:36,592 --> 00:39:40,709
WELL, I'M PROUD TO SAY, LADIES
AND GENTLEMEN, WE'VE EVENED THE
SCORE.

605
00:39:40,709 --> 00:39:45,506
DIDDY WAS CONVICTED AND
SENTENCED TO FOUR YEARS IN
PRISON.

HERE TO TALK ABOUT IT IS NEW
SNL CAST MEMBER KAM PATTERSON.

607
00:39:55,425 --> 00:39:57,478
>> WHAT'S UP COLIN.
>> WHAT'S UP KAM?

608
00:39:57,478 --> 00:39:59,250
>> LISTEN, I THINK DIDDY IS WEIRD

609
00:39:59,250 --> 00:40:01,721
BUT I ACTUALLY HAVE
SOMETHING MORE PRESSING TO TALK
ABOUT.

610
00:40:01,721 --> 00:40:03,285
LET'S GET DOWN TO BUSINESS.

611
00:40:03,285 --> 00:40:06,236
I'VE BEEN HERE 45 MINUTES NOW,

612
00:40:06,236 --> 00:40:09,259

00:45:59,023 --> 00:46:02,058
>> THE POINT IS, DOBBY CAME HERE

782
00:46:02,060 --> 00:46:03,860
TO SAY THAT WOMEN HAVE VAGINAS

783
00:46:03,862 --> 00:46:07,630
AND WOMEN'S BATHROOMS ARE FOR

784
00:46:07,632 --> 00:46:08,364
WOMEN ONLY AND GIRLS AND GHOSTS

785
00:46:08,366 --> 00:46:09,465
OF GIRLS.

786
00:46:09,467 --> 00:46:15,571
>> I DON'T EVEN GET THAT BECAUSE

787
00:46:15,573 --> 00:46:16,239
I NEVER READ THEM CORNY ASS

788
00:46:16,241 --> 00:46:18,441
BOOKS.

789
00:46:18,443 --> 00:46:21,344
>> OF COURSE SIR, DOBBY NEVER

790
00:46:21,346 --> 00:46:22,111
MEANT TO IMPLY THAT MR. CHE IS

791
00:46:22,113 --> 00:46:26,516
UNCOOL.

792
00:46:26,518 --> 00:46:35,591
>> IT'S FINE.

793
00:46:35,593 --> 00:46:40,763
HE'S VERY COOL, HE GOES TO STRIP

794
00:46:40,765 --> 00:46:41,364
CLUBS AND YANKEES GAMES.

795
00:46:41,366 --> 00:46:41,797
UNLIKE DOBBY.

796
00:46:41,799 --> 00:46:42,465
OH, NO, DOBBY IS MILLENNIAL

797
00:46:42,467 --> 00:46:42,798
CRINGE!

798
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:43,399
OH, NO!

799
00:46:43,401 --> 00:46:45,635
BAD DOBBY, BAD DOBBY!

800
00:46:45,637 --> 00:46:49,739
CRINGE DOBBY!

801
00:46:49,741 --> 00:46:50,406
>> WHY DO YOU KEEP HURTING

802
00:46:50,408 --> 00:46:50,773
YOURSELF?

803
00:46:50,775 --> 00:46:51,240
IT'S NOT RIGHT.

804
00:46:51,242 --> 00:46:51,974
>> WHY DOES DOBBY HURT HIMSELF?

805
00:46:51,976 --> 00:46:54,877
DOBBY DOESN'T KNOW.

806
00:46:54,879 --> 00:46:57,847
PERHAPS THAT'S WHAT HOUSE ELVES

807
00:46:57,849 --> 00:47:02,118
WERE TAUGHT WE'RE ALWAYS THE

808
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:02,852
PROBLEM, EVEN AS A 10th OF THE

809
00:47:02,854 --> 00:47:03,252
POPULATION.

810
00:47:03,254 --> 00:47:05,888
BUT WE'RE NOT

811
00:47:05,890 --> 00:47:11,761
THE VICTIM, MASTER ROWLING IS.

812
00:47:11,763 --> 00:47:12,995
JUST RECEIVED THIS T-SHIRT

813
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:18,334
SAYING THEY K ROWLING.

814
00:47:18,336 --> 00:47:18,968
NOW IT'S DOBBY'S FAVORITE

815
00:47:18,970 --> 00:47:19,302
SHIRTS.

816
00:47:19,304 --> 00:47:20,136
>> HEY, DOBBY, I HAVE READ THE

817
00:47:20,138 --> 00:47:20,536
BOOKS.

818
00:47:20,538 --> 00:47:21,571
>> OF COURSE YOU HAVE.

819
00:47:21,573 --> 00:47:22,838
>> AND YOUR MASTER GAVE YOU A

820
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:26,442
PIECE OF CLOTHING, DOESN'T THAT

821
00:47:26,444 --> 00:47:28,044
MEAN YOU'RE FREE?

822
00:47:28,046 --> 00:47:30,179
>> YOU MEAN, DOBBY IS FINALLY

823
00:47:30,181 --> 00:47:32,315
FREE TO SAY WHATEVER CHO/CHANG

824
00:47:32,317 --> 00:47:33,382
THINKS?

825
00:47:33,384 --> 00:47:36,052
>> YOUR REAL PRONOUNS ARE

826
00:47:36,054 --> 00:47:40,456
CHO/CHANG?

827
00:47:40,458 --> 00:47:48,998
>> LISTEN UP, WORLD, DOBBY HAS

828
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,032
SOMETHING TO SAY.

829
00:47:50,034 --> 00:47:50,733
GRINDLEWALD'S WORST CRIME WAS

830
00:47:50,735 --> 00:47:52,868
SODOMY.

831
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:53,469
>> DOBBY THE HOUSE ELF,

832
00:47:53,471 --> 00:47:55,237
EVERYBODY.

833
00:47:55,239 --> 00:47:57,607
FOR WEEKEND

834
00:48:27,070 --> 00:48:32,108
AND THEIR OWN LANGUAGE EMERGES

835
00:48:32,110 --> 00:48:32,475
TO

836
00:48:32,477 --> 00:48:33,209
UNITE THEIR PEOPLE WITH A COMMON

837
00:48:33,211 --> 00:48:34,043
TONGUE.

838
00:48:34,045 --> 00:48:35,678
>> GENTLEMEN, OUR NEW LANGUAGE,

839
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:38,347
SPANISH, IS COMING ALONG REALLY

840
00:48:38,349 --> 00:48:43,219
WELL.

841
00:48:43,221 --> 00:48:44,787
>> SO FAR, LOOKING GOOD.

842
00:48:44,789 --> 00:48:50,092
>> BUT I WAS THINKING, WHAT IF

843
00:48:50,094 --> 00:48:52,328
WE MADE IT HARDER TO LEARN.

844
00:48:52,330 --> 00:48:55,731
SO I HAD AN AMAZING IDEA.

845
00:48:55,733 --> 00:48:56,132
>> TELL US.

846
00:48:56,134 --> 00:48:57,333
>> TELL US.

847
00:48:57,335 --> 00:49:00,036
>> EVERY WORD IS A BOY OR A

848
00:49:00,038 --> 00:49:04,306
GIRL.

849
00:49:04,308 --> 00:49:05,908

00:49:05,910 --> 00:49:12,682

853
00:49:17,655 --> 00:49:20,189

854
00:49:20,191 --> 00:49:22,324
>> THE FIRST WORD IS MORNING.

855
00:49:22,326 --> 00:49:28,330
MORNING IS A GIRL.

856
00:49:28,332 --> 00:49:30,166
LA MANANA.

857
00:49:30,168 --> 00:49:32,835
>> YES, THE MORNING IS A GIRL

00:49:37,308 --> 00:49:41,110

>> THE NEXT WORD IS OCEAN.

866
00:49:48,886 --> 00:49:52,121
OCEAN IS A BOY.

867
00:49:52,123 --> 00:49:54,824
EL OCEANO.

868
00:49:54,826 --> 00:49:55,925
>> THE OCEAN IS A BOY BECAUSE

869
00:49:55,927 --> 00:49:58,594
IT'S FUN BUT SOMETIMES FOR NO

870

>> UM, EXCUSE ME.

878
00:50:18,082 --> 00:50:21,317

00:50:33,998 --> 00:50:36,132
SAYING SOME OF THESE WORDS.

884
00:50:36,134 --> 00:50:38,667
>> THAT'S BECAUSE YOUR TONGUE IS

885
00:50:38,669 --> 00:50:44,940
TOO FAR OUT OF YOUR MOUTH.

886
00:50:44,942 --> 00:50:45,641
PUT YOUR TONGUE BACK IN YOUR

887
00:50:45,643 --> 00:50:46,041

THE BIBLE.

THE BIBLE IS A GIRL.

892
00:50:50,348 --> 00:50:52,515
>> WHY IS THE BIBLE A GIRL?

893
00:50:52,517 --> 00:50:55,417
>> BECAUSE IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

894
00:50:55,419 --> 00:50:56,051

895
00:50:56,053 --> 00:50:56,519

00:50:56,521 --> 00:50:57,620
EVERYTHING YOU WANT TO DO IT SAY

897
00:50:57,622 --> 00:50:58,120
NO.

898
00:50:58,122 --> 00:51:02,358

00:51:13,004 --> 00:51:16,906
REMEMBER ALL OF THIS.

907
00:51:16,908 --> 00:51:19,975
I THINK WE SHOULD SKIP THIS.

908
00:51:19,977 --> 00:51:22,812

909
00:51:22,814 --> 00:51:23,546

00:51:50,141 --> 00:51:59,648
TOTALLY USELESS IN REAL LIFE,

PLEASE LISTEN CAREFULLY.

OKAY.

925
00:52:13,631 --> 00:52:14,296
WE WILL DO ALSO FORMAL AND

926
00:52:14,298 --> 00:52:18,133
INFORMAL.

927
00:52:18,135 --> 00:52:18,634
LIKE YOU AND YOU.

928
00:52:18,636 --> 00:52:21,303

RELATED TO ANYTHING.

938
00:52:50,001 --> 00:52:51,000
I THINK WE SHOULD TAKE A NAP IN

939
00:52:51,002 --> 00:52:52,868
THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY.

940
00:52:52,870 --> 00:52:55,104
