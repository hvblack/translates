1
00:00:01,551 --> 00:00:04,803
EARLIER

2
00:00:04,803 --> 00:00:07,992
BRILLIANT IDEA TO GATHER ALL OF
OUR NATION'S TOP GENERALS

3
00:00:07,992 --> 00:00:09,662
IN ONE
PLACE AT ONE TIME.

4
00:00:09,662 --> 00:00:11,836
TO THROW OUR ENEMIES OFF THE SCENT,

5
00:00:11,836 --> 00:00:14,993
HE TOLD THEM EXACTLY
WHERE AND WHEN IT WOULD HAPPEN.

6
00:00:14,993 --> 00:00:17,688
WE TAKE YOU TO THIS MEETING NOW.

7
00:00:22,804 --> 00:00:25,187
>> TEN HUT!

8
00:00:25,341 --> 00:00:26,917
WELCOME, GENERALS.

9
00:00:27,099 --> 00:00:31,265
YOU HAVE ALL DEDICATED YOUR
LIVES TO DEFENDING THIS NATION.

10
00:00:31,265 --> 00:00:34,250
AS A REWARD, YOU WILL NOW BE YELLED AT

11
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:36,837
BY A FORMER FOX NEWS
HOST.

12
00:00:36,837 --> 00:00:40,891
PLEASE WELCOME THE SECRETARY OF WAR,

13
00:00:40,891 --> 00:00:43,008
PETE HEGSETH.

14
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:53,788
>> YEAH.

15
00:00:53,788 --> 00:00:55,754
CUT THE CRAP!

16
00:00:57,136 --> 00:00:59,194
LISTEN UP, EVERYONE, OKAY?

17
00:00:59,194 --> 00:01:04,804
I SUMMONED YOU ALL HERE TODAY TO
ADDRESS A SERIOUS PROBLEM.
OKAY?

18
00:01:04,804 --> 00:01:09,006
OUR MILITARY IS GAY
AS HELL.

19
00:01:09,617 --> 00:01:12,763
I'M NOT JUST TALKING ABOUT THE
NAVY.

20
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:17,234
THANKS TO FAILED LIBERAL POLICIES,

21
00:01:17,234 --> 00:01:19,793
OUR ARMY HAS NEVER BEEN GAYER,

22
00:01:19,793 --> 00:01:23,657
AND YET IT'S ALSO
NEVER BEEN FATTER.

23
00:01:23,657 --> 00:01:26,387
MAKE THAT MAKE SENSE.

24
00:01:26,387 --> 00:01:28,855
AM I RIGHT?

25
00:01:31,578 --> 00:01:34,118
YOU ALL ARE FUN.

26
00:01:34,118 --> 00:01:39,498
FROM NOW ON, OUR FIGHTING MEN
AND I GUESS WOMEN

27
00:01:39,498 --> 00:01:43,393
ARE GOING TO
ADHERE TO THE HIGHEST MALE
STANDARDS,

28
00:01:43,393 --> 00:01:47,390
WHICH HAVE BEEN SET
BY OUR PRESIDENT, DONALD TRUMP.

29
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:51,328
6'6".
BUCK 75.

30
00:01:51,328 --> 00:01:54,381
A-CUPS, PERKY,

31
00:01:54,381 --> 00:01:58,794
WITH A DUMPTRUCK
IN THE BACK YOU WOULDN'T EVEN
BELIEVE.

32
00:01:58,794 --> 00:02:01,960
AND HEY, YOU DON'T WANT TO LOSE
THE WEIGHT?

33
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,745
YOU DON'T WANT TO FOLLOW THE
RULES,

34
00:02:03,745 --> 00:02:08,265
NO PROBLEM.
YOU KNOW WHO IS GOING TO WANT
YOUR SICK, TWISTED FAT ASS?

35
00:02:08,265 --> 00:02:09,877
I.C.E.

36
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:14,216
WE HAVE A SIGN-UP SHEET IN THE
HALLWAY, CHECK THEM OUT.

37
00:02:14,216 --> 00:02:19,573
IN HERE WE'RE
DOING ARMY AND ONLY ARMY.

38
00:02:19,573 --> 00:02:22,489
AND WE'RE GOING TO BE DOING IT
IN ONE OF THE BLOODIEST,

39
00:02:22,489 --> 00:02:25,233
WAR-TORN PLACES ON FACE OF THE EARTH --

40
00:02:25,233 --> 00:02:27,891
PORTLAND, OREGON.

41
00:02:28,285 --> 00:02:31,388
NOW BACK TO THE FAT THING.

42
00:02:31,888 --> 00:02:36,907
OUR MILITARY WILL NOW HAVE THE
SAME RULES AS ANY GOOD FRAT
PARTY.

43
00:02:36,907 --> 00:02:39,610
NO FAT CHICKS.

44
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:45,129
IF YOU'RE A FAT DUDE, GODDAMN
IT, YOU BETTER BE FUNNY AS HELL.

45
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:50,634
IN SUMMARY -- THIS IS THE WHOLE MEETING,

46
00:02:50,634 --> 00:02:55,055
NO FUGGOS, NO FATTIES,

47
00:02:55,055 --> 00:02:58,414
NO FACIAL HAIR, NO BODY
HAIR.

48
00:02:58,414 --> 00:03:02,596
JUST HOT, SHREDDED, HAIRLESS MEN

49
00:03:02,596 --> 00:03:06,218
WHO ARE DEFINITELY NOT GAY.

50
00:03:06,218 --> 00:03:08,529
BECAUSE THIS IS SERIOUS.

51
00:03:08,529 --> 00:03:12,051
WE ARE FACING THE
GREATEST THREAT TO FREEDOM AND
DEMOCRACY

52
00:03:12,051 --> 00:03:13,569
THE WORLD HAS EVER KNOWN

53
00:03:13,569 --> 00:03:16,097
AND WE ALL KNOW WHAT THAT
THREAT IS.

54
00:03:16,097 --> 00:03:18,913
>> LATE NIGHT TV.

55
00:03:18,913 --> 00:03:22,525
WELL, HELLO, GOOD TO BE HERE.

56
00:03:22,525 --> 00:03:25,838
YES, IT'S ME, YOUR FAVORITE
PRESIDENT.

57
00:03:25,838 --> 00:03:28,222
I'M LIKE THE LATE, GREAT
BEETLEJUICE.

58
00:03:28,222 --> 00:03:31,697
YOU SAY
MY NAME ZERO TIMES AND I APPEAR.

59
00:03:31,697 --> 00:03:34,890
I'M JUST HERE KEEPING AN EYE ON SNL

60
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:37,870
MAKING SURE THEY DON'T DO
ANYTHING TOO MEAN ABOUT ME.

61
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:39,383
THEY BETTER BE CAREFUL,

62
00:03:39,383 --> 00:03:43,891
I KNOW LATE NIGHT
TV LIKE THE BACK OF MY HANDS,

63
00:03:43,891 --> 00:03:46,280
NOT LOOKING GREAT RIGHT NOW.

64
00:03:46,565 --> 00:03:47,777
DON'T LOOK AT THAT.

65
00:03:47,777 --> 00:03:50,728
GOING TO COVER THIS UP FOR THE
REST OF MY LIFE.

66
00:03:50,728 --> 00:03:53,639
SNL 51 ALREADY OFF TO A ROUGH
START.

67
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:55,806
17 NEW CAST MEMBERS

68
00:03:55,806 --> 00:03:58,931
AND THEY GOT
THE UPDATE GUY DOING THE OPEN.

69
00:03:58,931 --> 00:04:02,026
WOW, LOOK AT COLIN, POOR COLIN.

70
00:04:02,026 --> 00:04:05,931
WE ALL KNOW THEY WERE NEVER
GOING TO LET HIM DO THE WHOLE
OPENING BY HIMSELF.

71
00:04:05,931 --> 00:04:09,785
CAN'T EVEN DO UPDATE BY HIMSELF,
HE NEEDS MICHAEL CHE.

72
00:04:09,785 --> 00:04:11,731
I NEED MY CHE.

73
00:04:11,731 --> 00:04:14,017
FRANKLY I'M SURPRISED COLIN'S HERE,

74
00:04:14,017 --> 00:04:18,274
I THOUGHT HE WOULD BE WITH
HIS FRIENDS AT THE RIYADH COMEDY
FESTIVAL.

75
00:04:18,274 --> 00:04:20,828
>> I DIDN'T GET AN OFFER.

76
00:04:20,828 --> 00:04:24,285
>> THAT'S SAD.
WE LOVE THE SAUDIS

77
00:04:24,285 --> 00:04:27,440
BECAUSE THEY
LIKE TO SAW THESE JOURNALISTS IN
HALF.

78
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,868
THAT'S THE KIND OF THING THAT
WOULD KILL OVER THERE.

79
00:04:29,868 --> 00:04:31,307
ALL RIGHT, COLIN,

80
00:04:31,307 --> 00:04:34,905
THOSE SPIRIT AIRLINES JOKES
AREN'T GOING TO WRITE
THEMSELVES.

81
00:04:34,905 --> 00:04:36,139
BYE.

82
00:04:36,139 --> 00:04:41,630
OH, AND COLIN, MAY EVERY DAY BE
ANOTHER WONDERFUL SECRET.

83
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:44,383
THAT WAS A QUOTE FROM A POEM

84
00:04:44,383 --> 00:04:47,121
I WROTE TO A
HORRIBLE MAN I'VE NEVER MET
BEFORE.

85
00:04:47,121 --> 00:04:50,837
BUT HERE WE ARE, "SNL" SEASON 51,

86
00:04:50,837 --> 00:04:53,343
SHOULD HAVE CALLED IT AT 50,
RIGHT?

87
00:04:53,343 --> 00:04:56,371
IT'S SO SAD TO SEE SOMETHING GET
OLD AND CONFUSED

88
00:04:56,371 --> 00:04:59,306
YET STILL
DEMAND CONSTANT ATTENTION.

89
00:04:59,306 --> 00:05:00,949
OH, WELL.

90
00:05:00,949 --> 00:05:04,373
BUT THEY BETTER BE ON THEIR BEST
BEHAVIOR, OTHERWISE THEY'RE
GOING TO HAVE TO ANSWER

91
00:05:04,373 --> 00:05:09,421
TO MY
ATTACK DOG AT THE FCC, BRANDON
CARR.

92
00:05:16,368 --> 00:05:20,369
ALL RIGHT.
THANKS BRANDON.

93
00:05:23,206 --> 00:05:25,733
>> IT'S ACTUALLY BRENDAN, SIR.

94
00:05:25,733 --> 00:05:28,959
>> IT'S CRAZY THAT YOU THINK I
CARE.
BYE.

95
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:30,995
YOU GOT TO STOP.

96
00:05:30,995 --> 00:05:33,193
WELL, I HAD A GREAT SUMMER,

97
00:05:33,193 --> 00:05:36,042
I TOOK A LITTLE VACATION TIME
FOR GOLF AND TRAVEL

98
00:05:36,042 --> 00:05:37,771
AND STROKE.

99
00:05:37,771 --> 00:05:38,840
KIDDING.

100
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:41,313
OR NOT.
WE'LL NEVER KNOW, WILL WE?

101
00:05:41,313 --> 00:05:46,162
WHAT ELSE, I ENDED EVERY WAR,

102
00:05:46,162 --> 00:05:50,381
EXCEPT THE TWO MAIN ONES STILL
HAPPENING AND MORE VICIOUS THAN
EVER.

103
00:05:50,381 --> 00:05:55,356
NOW STARTING A NEW WAR IN
VENEZUELA SOON,

104
00:05:55,356 --> 00:05:59,756
THAT'S VERY
EXCITING AND THEY ASK HOW ARE
YOU GOING TO WAY FOR ALL THIS,

105
00:05:59,756 --> 00:06:02,552
AND I TELL THEM,
WITH MY SCAMS.

106
00:06:02,552 --> 00:06:05,214
MY BEAUTIFUL SCAMS.

107
00:06:05,214 --> 00:06:09,122
OUR NEXT ONE IS TRUMPRX, MY OWN
PHARMACY.

108
00:06:09,122 --> 00:06:11,891
LIKE
WE'VE GOT EVERYTHING,

109
00:06:11,891 --> 00:06:15,428
HAIR PILLS, BONER PILLS, END OF LIST.

110
00:06:15,428 --> 00:06:19,395
I GUESS I'LL LET THEM START THE
SHOW.
THE CREW IS READY TO GO.

111
00:06:19,395 --> 00:06:23,028
THANK YOU "SNL" CREW FOR YOUR
HARD WORK AND YOUR VOTES.

112
00:06:23,028 --> 00:06:27,830
KEEP AN EYE ON MARCELLO FOR ME,
RIGHT?

113
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:30,699
GOOD, FANTASTIC.

114
00:06:30,699 --> 00:06:34,528
HERE WE GO,
AND JUST REMEMBER, DADDY'S
WATCHING,

115
00:06:34,528 --> 00:06:38,792
AND LIVE FROM
NEW YORK, IT'S SATURDAY NIGHT!

116
00:08:41,505 --> 00:08:45,347
MUSICAL GUEST DOJA CAT,

117
00:08:46,393 --> 00:08:50,318
AND YOUR HOST, BAD BUNNY!

118
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:59,076
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, BAD BUNNY!

119
00:09:22,801 --> 00:09:26,665
THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU,

120
00:09:26,665 --> 00:09:28,720
IT'S SO GOOD TO BE BACK.

121
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,541
THIS IS MY SECOND TIME HOSTING

122
00:09:32,541 --> 00:09:35,896
AND
MY FOURTH TIME BEING HERE.

123
00:09:35,896 --> 00:09:37,916
AND I THINK MARCELLO IS GETTING NERVOUS

124
00:09:37,916 --> 00:09:41,314
THAT LORNE HAS A NEW
FAVORITE LATINO.

125
00:09:42,363 --> 00:09:44,707
>> I AM.

126
00:09:45,154 --> 00:09:49,523
>> THIS TIME I'M ONLY HOSTING
BECAUSE I NEED A REST.

127
00:09:49,523 --> 00:09:55,108
I JUST FINISHED A 31-SHOW
RESIDENCY IN PUERTO RICO

128
00:09:56,770 --> 00:10:03,135
AND I'M
STILL KIND OF TIRED BECAUSE THE
SHOWS ARE THREE HOURS LONG

129
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:08,910
AND
THERE'S A LOT OF COMPLICATED
CHOREOGRAPHY, LIKE THIS.

130
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:19,715
THAT LOOKED
SIMPLE, BUT

131
00:10:19,715 --> 00:10:23,719
THAT TOOK ME A LONG
TIME TO LEARN.
TRUST ME.

132
00:10:23,719 --> 00:10:28,222
ANYWAYS, MY RESIDENCY WAS
BEAUTIFUL, EVERYONE LOVED IT.

133
00:10:28,222 --> 00:10:30,959
SOME CELEBRITIES CAME TO MY
SHOW.

134
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:35,297
FEW OF THEM WERE ON DRUGS.

135
00:10:35,765 --> 00:10:38,560
AND I DON'T WANT TO SAY WHO,

136
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:42,732
BUT THIS WAS JON HAMM.

137
00:10:47,779 --> 00:10:52,168
ACTUALLY, ACTUALLY, THAT WASN'T JON HAMM,

138
00:10:52,168 --> 00:10:55,519
THAT WAS JUAN JAMON.

139
00:11:03,597 --> 00:11:07,400
I THINK HE'S OBSESSED WITH ME.

140
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:11,308
ANYWAY, YOU MIGHT NOT KNOW THIS,

141
00:11:11,308 --> 00:11:15,905
BUT I'M DOING THE SUPER BOWL
HALFTIME SHOW.

142
00:11:18,628 --> 00:11:22,890
AND I'M VERY HAPPY,

143
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:25,848
AND I THINK EVERYONE IS HAPPY ABOUT IT.

144
00:11:27,441 --> 00:11:31,730
EVEN FOX NEWS.

145
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:33,067
>> BAD BUNNY.
>> IS.

146
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:34,377
>> MY FAVORITE.
>> MUSICIAN.

147
00:11:34,377 --> 00:11:37,232
>> AND HE SHOULD BE THE NEXT.
>> PRESIDENT.

148
00:11:38,684 --> 00:11:42,159
>> WOW, THANK YOU.

149
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:46,423
NO, REALLY, I'M VERY EXCITED TO
BE DOING THE SUPER BOWL.

150
00:11:46,423 --> 00:11:49,029
AND I KNOW THAT PEOPLE ALL
AROUND THE WORLD

151
00:11:49,029 --> 00:11:52,297
WHO LOVE MY
MUSIC ARE ALSO HAPPY.

152
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:30,834
AND IF YOU DIDN'T UNDERSTAND
WHAT I JUST SAID,

153
00:12:31,218 --> 00:12:35,324
YOU HAVE FOUR
MONTHS TO LEARN.

154
00:12:35,324 --> 00:12:40,182
WE HAVE A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU
TONIGHT.
DOJA CAT IS HERE.

155
00:12:40,182 --> 00:12:44,889
SO STICK AROUND, WE'LL BE RIGHT

00:21:53,241 --> 00:21:57,085
OR HE FORGETS HOW TO GET IT OUT.

308
00:21:57,085 --> 00:21:59,682
>> I KNOW HOW TO GET IT OUT.
THANK YOU.

309
00:21:59,682 --> 00:22:02,024
>> MAN, WE DON'T KNOW YOU.

310
00:22:02,024 --> 00:22:05,936
>> WELL, MY NAME IS ELVIRO GUTIERREZ,

311
00:22:05,936 --> 00:22:09,576
AND ONE FUN FACT ABOUT ME IS

312
00:22:09,576 --> 00:22:15,056
I THINK THE ENDING
OF "SOPRANOS" WAS PERFECT.

313
00:22:15,056 --> 00:22:19,891
>> NICE TO MEET YOU, ELVIRO, BUT
THIS IS A PRIVATE CONVERSATION.

314
00:22:19,891 --> 00:22:23,075
>> MY MISTAKE, JUST TRYING TO
HELP.

315
00:22:23,075 --> 00:22:24,729
>> GREAT.

316
00:22:24,729 --> 00:22:28,671
ANYWAYS, MATT, WE REALLY THINK
YOU WOULD BE THE PERFECT DONOR FOR US,

317
00:22:28,671 --> 00:22:30,819
BUT SERIOUSLY, THERE'S
NO PRESSURE.

318
00:22:30,819 --> 00:22:33,585
>> DO YOU MIND IF I STEP OUTSIDE
AND CALL JEN?

319
00:22:33,585 --> 00:22:36,916
I THINK A BIG DECISION LIKE
THAT, MY FIANCE SHOULD WEIGH IN.

320
00:22:36,916 --> 00:22:39,011
>> OF COURSE.
>> WHATEVER YOU NEED.

321
00:22:39,011 --> 00:22:40,494
THANK

322
00:22:40,494 --> 00:22:44,415
>> IF MATT SAYS NO, WE CAN
ALWAYS GO BACK TO THE CLINIC.

323
00:22:44,415 --> 00:22:47,247
>> IT'S JUST SO EXPENSIVE.

324
00:22:49,247 --> 00:22:53,425
>> I COULD GIVE YOU SOME.

325
00:22:56,373 --> 00:23:01,216
>> I SAID, I COULD GIVE YOU SOME
OF MY STUFF.

326
00:23:01,216 --> 00:23:02,459
>> WHAT?
>> YEAH.

327
00:23:02,459 --> 00:23:04,787
AND THEN YOU COULD DO WHATEVER
YOU WANT WITH IT.

328
00:23:04,787 --> 00:23:07,801
YOU CAN PUT IN THE FRONT, YOU
CAN PUT IN THE BACK.

329
00:23:07,801 --> 00:23:10,101
IT'S UP TO YOU.

330
00:23:10,101 --> 00:23:12,060
>> YEAH, WE'RE OKAY.

331
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:16,060
>> WE DON'T KNOW YOU AND WE
DON'T NEED YOUR RANDOM SPERM.

332
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:18,208
>> I'LL TAKE IT.

333
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:24,820
>> WHAT?
>> I SAID I'LL TAKE IT IF YOU'RE
JUST GIVING IT AWAY

334
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:29,286
AS THE SAYING GOES, WHEN GOD
OPENS A WINDOW, YOU TAKE THE
SPERM.

335
00:23:29,286 --> 00:23:33,719
>> NO NOSHS, NO, I WANT TO BE A
FATHER.

336
00:23:33,719 --> 00:23:37,561
SO WHO WILL CARRY MY BABY.

337
00:23:37,561 --> 00:23:40,682
I HOPE NOT THIS ONE.

338
00:23:40,682 --> 00:23:43,976
>> WHAT?
>> NO ONE IS CARRYING YOUR BABY.

339
00:23:43,976 --> 00:23:47,188
>> HEY, GUYS, SO SORRY THAT
CALL TOOK SO LONG.

340
00:23:47,188 --> 00:23:50,424
BUT JEN AND I DISCUSSED IT AND
MY ANSWER

341
00:23:50,424 --> 00:23:52,214
IS YES, I'D LOVE TO BE YOUR DONOR.

342
00:23:52,214 --> 00:23:56,233
>> OH, MY GOD, REALLY?
>> MATT, THAT'S AMAZING.

343
00:23:56,233 --> 00:23:58,989
>> WE COULD MIX IT TOGETHER.

344
00:23:58,989 --> 00:24:02,409
HIS STUFF, MY STUFF --

345
00:24:02,409 --> 00:24:04,043
>> MAYBE MY STUFF AS WELL.

346
00:24:04,043 --> 00:24:07,459
>> YOU KNOW WHAT, MAYBE WE
SHOULD GET OUT OF HERE AND
CELEBRATE.

347
00:24:07,459 --> 00:24:09,928
>> ABSOLUTELY.
>> DEFINITELY.

348
00:24:11,085 --> 00:24:14,735
>> GUESS I'LL NEVER GET TO
FATHER A CHILD.

349
00:24:14,735 --> 00:24:19,960
>> I'M AFRAID SOME PEOPLE ARE
JUST MEANT TO WALK THE EARTH
ALONE.

350
00:24:23,078 --> 00:24:25,390
>> DAD?

351
00:25:03,912 --> 00:25:06,918
CHEERS

352

00:25:11,277 --> 00:25:14,125
>> LIKE FIVE YEARS AT LEAST.

354
00:25:14,125 --> 00:25:17,642
>> WHY IS IT SO HARD TO FIND
TIME TO SEE FRIENDS

355
00:25:17,642 --> 00:25:20,272
OR
EXPERIENCE ANY CULTURE?

356
00:25:20,272 --> 00:25:24,986
>> I'M DYING TO SEE THE NEW PAUL
THOMAS ANDERSON MOVIE "ONE
BATTLE AFTER ANOTHER."

357
00:25:24,986 --> 00:25:27,542
>> IT'S SO GOOD, YOU HAVE TO SEE
IT.

358
00:25:27,542 --> 00:25:30,751
>> AND DEL TORO HAS

360
00:25:33,144 --> 00:25:37,922
>> I LIKE "KPOP DEMON HUNTERS."

361
00:25:38,854 --> 00:25:41,205
>> THAT'S SUPPOSED TO BE FUN.

362
00:25:41,205 --> 00:25:44,346
>> YEAH.
HAVE YOU BEEN WATCHING IT WITH
YOUR KIDS?

363
00:25:44,346 --> 00:25:46,939
>> I DON'T HAVE KIDS.

364
00:25:46,939 --> 00:25:49,724
>> OH, OKAY.
THAT'S COOL.

365
00:25:49,724 --> 00:25:51,967
YEAH, IT'S A HUGE PHENOMENON,

366
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:55,675
LIKE EVERY
KID I KNOW IS DRESSING UP LIKE
THE DEMON HUNTERS FOR HALLOWEEN.

367
00:25:55,675 --> 00:25:58,793
>> IT'S ACTUALLY NOT FOR KIDS

368
00:25:58,793 --> 00:26:02,106
BUT FOR SMART ADULTS.

369
00:26:02,106 --> 00:26:05,454
>> RIGHT.
WE CAN JUST CHANGE THE SUBJECT.

370
00:26:05,454 --> 00:26:07,587
DID YOU SEE ANY CONCERTS THIS
SUMMER?

371
00:26:07,587 --> 00:26:10,929
I SAW LADY GAGA AND IT WAS
HONESTLY LIFE CHANGING.

372
00:26:10,929 --> 00:26:13,439
>> YOU KNOW WHAT MUSIC I LIKE?

THAT'S COOL THOMAS.

375
00:26:20,121 --> 00:26:23,987
>> ACTUALLY, IT'S NOT COOL, DOG.

376
00:26:23,987 --> 00:26:26,889
IN "KPOP DEMON HUNTERS,"

377
00:26:26,889 --> 00:26:30,877
SONGS ARE NOT JUST
SONGS BUT WEAPONS.

378
00:26:30,877 --> 00:26:32,958
>> WEAPONS?

379
00:26:32,958 --> 00:26:38,541

383
00:26:47,764 --> 00:26:51,629
BUT THERE'S NO
REASON TO GET UPSET OVER A
MOVIE.

384
00:26:51,629 --> 00:26:55,847
>> YOU SILLY, STUPID MAN.

385

YOU THINK IT'S JUST A MOVIE?

386
00:26:59,615 --> 00:27:04,581
IT SAYS AT THE BEGINNING IT'S
BASED ON A TRUE STORY.

387
00:27:04,581 --> 00:27:06,602
>> I DON'T THINK IT DOES.

388
00:27:06,602 --> 00:27:10,969
>> CAN WE JUST STOP TALKING
ABOUT "KPOP DEMON HUNTERS"?

389

>> THOSE DUMB IDIOTS HAVE NO
IDEA, STUPID DUMMIES.

394
00:27:28,149 --> 00:27:30,334
I DON'T CARE IF THEY BELIEVE ME.

00:33:05,434 --> 00:33:08,853
HE'S A GUN TO MY HEAD Â¶

YOU UGLY

00:34:21,543 --> 00:34:23,685
Â¶ AND IF I HAD MORE
COMMON SENSE

512
00:34:23,685 --> 00:34:26,407
THEN I WOULD GRAB MY
RIDE AND DIP Â¶

513
00:35:00,812 --> 00:35:05,886
WEEKEND

514
00:35:15,657 --> 00:35:18,719
THANK

515
00:35:18,719 --> 00:35:22,467
>> I'M COLIN JOST.

516
00:35:23,975 --> 00:35:27,572
GOVERNMENT FINALLY REPRESENTED THE PEOPLE

517
00:35:27,572 --> 00:35:30,329
WHEN IT JUST
COMPLETELY SHUT DOWN.

518
00:35:30,329 --> 00:35:33,725
HONESTLY DIDN'T IT FEEL LIKE THE
GOVERNMENT NEEDED A BREAK?

519
00:35:33,725 --> 00:35:35,607
JUST SO WE COULD ALL CATCH OUR
BREATHS.

520
00:35:35,607 --> 00:35:39,240
CAN YOU BELIEVE WE'RE ONLY NINE
MONTHS INTO THIS PRESIDENCY.

521
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:43,774
THAT MEANS WE ONLY HAVE THREE
MONTHS AND SEVEN YEARS
REMAINING.

522
00:35:43,774 --> 00:35:46,683
I ALREADY TRIED FIGHTING, I'M
TIRED.

523
00:35:46,683 --> 00:35:48,848
I WENT TO SO MANY PROTESTS THIS SUMMER,

524
00:35:48,848 --> 00:35:51,834
BUT IT WAS
FINALLY WORTH IT BECAUSE WE
FINALLY GOT THEM TO CHANGE

525
00:35:51,834 --> 00:35:55,357
THE
CRACKER BARREL LOGO BACK TO THE ORIGINAL

526
00:35:55,357 --> 00:35:58,493
ACTUAL GRANDPA.

527
00:35:58,493 --> 00:36:01,109
I KNOW IT'S SCARY FOR A LOT OF
PEOPLE RIGHT NOW,

528
00:36:01,109 --> 00:36:05,239
BUT I'M TRYING
TO STAY POSITIVE AND REMEMBER
THE WORDS OF A GREAT MAN.

529
00:36:05,239 --> 00:36:08,962
>> NOTHING BAD CAN HAPPEN, IT
CAN ONLY GOOD HAPPEN.

530
00:36:10,134 --> 00:36:12,772
>> THE LAST TIME THE U.S.
GOVERNMENT SHUT DOWN

531
00:36:12,772 --> 00:36:16,830
WAS DURING PRESIDENT
TRUMP'S FIRST ADMINISTRATION IN 2018,

532
00:36:16,830 --> 00:36:20,451
WHICH WAS SO LONG AGO THAT
WE LOOKED LIKE THIS.

533
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:26,428
PRESIDENT TRUMP CLAIMED THAT ONE
OF THE REASONS THE GOVERNMENT SHUT DOWN

534
00:36:26,428 --> 00:36:30,158
IS BECAUSE DEMOCRATS
WANT TRANSGENDER FOR EVERYBODY.

535
00:36:30,158 --> 00:36:32,377
WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY NOT TRUE,

536
00:36:32,377 --> 00:36:36,813
BUT AT THE SAME TIME, I WOULDN'T SAY
NO MY OWN SET OF THESE.

537
00:36:38,178 --> 00:36:40,733
GOT TO WEAR THEM.

538
00:36:42,518 --> 00:36:45,805
>> ISRAEL AND HAMAS HAVE
TENTATIVELY AGREED

539
00:36:45,805 --> 00:36:48,731
TO PRESIDENT
TRUMP'S PLAN TO END THE WAR IN
GAZA.

540
00:36:48,731 --> 00:36:52,242
AND YOU COULD TELL THAT TRUMP
WROTE THE PLAN HIMSELF.

541
00:36:54,810 --> 00:36:58,555
>> A TRUMP ADVISER SAID I.C.E.
AGENTS WILL ATTEND THE SUPER BOWL

542
00:36:58,555 --> 00:37:01,925
AFTER BAD BUNNY WAS
ANNOUNCED AS THE HALFTIME
PERFORMER.

543
00:37:01,925 --> 00:37:06,426
YOU KNOW, TO CATCH ALL THOSE
FARM WORKERS WHO CAN AFFORD
SUPER BOWL TICKETS.

544
00:37:06,426 --> 00:37:12,148
THE FDA QUIETLY APPROVED THE
GENERIC ABORTION PILL JUST
BEFORE THE SHUTDOWN.

545
00:37:12,148 --> 00:37:13,694
I DON'T HAVE A JOKE

546
00:37:13,694 --> 00:37:17,971
BUT WHENEVER I MENTION A PRODUCT ON AIR THEY
SEND ME A BOX FOR FREE.

547
00:37:25,831 --> 00:37:29,738
>> PRESIDENT TRUMP ALSO SPOKE TO
A GROUP OF MILITARY LEADERS THIS WEEK,

548
00:37:29,738 --> 00:37:31,786
AT ONE POINT WENT ON A LONG RANT

549
00:37:31,786 --> 00:37:35,741
HOW GOOD BARACK OBAMA
WAS WALKING DOWN THE STAIRS.

550
00:37:35,741 --> 00:37:38,121
I'M NOT GOING TO READ IT,

551
00:37:38,121 --> 00:37:40,911
IT WAS CRAZY TO HEAR FROM A PRESIDENT

552
00:37:40,911 --> 00:37:43,313
BUT FUN FROM ANYONE ELSE.

553
00:37:43,313 --> 00:37:45,286
LET ME SHOW YOU WHAT I MEAN IN
OUR NEW SEGMENT,

554
00:37:45,286 --> 00:37:47,498
PRESIDENT TRUMP
WOULD MAKE A LOT MORE SENSE

555
00:37:47,498 --> 00:37:50,460
IF
HE SOUNDED LIKE JENNIFER
COOLIDGE.

556
00:37:51,827 --> 00:37:54,751
>> BE COOL.
BE COOL WHEN YOU WALK DOWN

557
00:37:54,751 --> 00:37:57,880
BUT
DON'T DOWN THE STAIRS.

558
00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:01,842
ONE THING WITH OBAMA, I HAVE
ZERO RESPECT FOR HIM AS A PRESIDENT,

559
00:38:01,842 --> 00:38:04,628
BUT HE WOULD BOP DOWN
THOSE STAIRS.

560
00:38:06,468 --> 00:38:11,308
>> THIS HAS BEEN PRESIDENT TRUMP
WOULD MAKE A LOT MORE SENSE IF
HE SOUNDED LIKE JENNIFER
COOLIDGE.

561
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:17,564
>> SEAN COMBS WAS SENTENCED
ON FRIDAY TO FOUR YEARS IN
PRISON.

562
00:38:17,564 --> 00:38:21,640
I'LL BE HONEST,
IT'S HARD TO WATCH SOMEONE I
LOVE GET PUNISHED,

563
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:24,455
BUT THAT'S
WHAT DIDDY WOULD DO.

564
00:38:30,381 --> 00:38:34,974
DURING SEAN COMBS' SENTENCING,
HE PLEADED FOR MERCY, SAYING THAT

565
00:38:34,974 --> 00:38:38,231
THE
THINGS HE DID WERE DISGUSTING,
SHAMEFUL AND SICK,

566
00:38:38,231 --> 00:38:42,938
IN FACT JUST
THINKING ABOUT THEM MAKES HIM
HARDER THAN GRANDMA'S CANDY.

567
00:38:44,137 --> 00:38:46,608
>> THEY SHOWED THE CANDY.

568
00:38:46,608 --> 00:38:48,781
>> IT'S HARD CANDY.
>> YEAH, HARD CANDY.

569
00:38:48,781 --> 00:38:52,026
>> IT WAS REPORTED THAT ELON
MUSK HAS BECOME THE FIRST PERSON

570
00:38:52,026 --> 00:38:55,074
TO BE WORTH MORE THAN $500
BILLION.

571
00:38:55,074 --> 00:38:58,202
WOW, SHOUT-OUT TO TYLENOL.

572
00:39:01,539 --> 00:39:07,904
>> NEW YORK MAYOR ERIC ADAMS HAS
ENDED HIS RE-ELECTION BID,

573
00:39:07,904 --> 00:39:11,711
CITING AN OFFICIAL REASON

574
00:39:11,711 --> 00:39:14,860
OF TOO MUCH SWAGGER FOR
Y'ALL.

575
00:39:15,804 --> 00:39:21,278
KAMALA HARRIS HAS RELEASED A NEW
BOOK THAT EXPLAINS HOW SHE LOST
THE 2024 ELECTION.

576
00:39:21,278 --> 00:39:24,125
IT'S CALLED "I'M A BLACK LADY."

577
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:30,454
>> STILL THINKING ABOUT YOU WITH
THOSE BOOBS.

578
00:39:30,454 --> 00:39:36,592
YESTERDAY MARKED 30 YEARS TO
THE DAY OF OJ SIMPSON'S
ACQUITTAL.

579
00:39:36,592 --> 00:39:40,709
WELL, I'M PROUD TO SAY, LADIES
AND GENTLEMEN, WE'VE EVENED THE
SCORE.

580
00:39:40,709 --> 00:39:45,506
DIDDY WAS CONVICTED AND
SENTENCED TO FOUR YEARS IN
PRISON.

581
00:39:45,506 --> 00:39:50,326
HERE TO TALK ABOUT IT IS NEW
SNL CAST MEMBER KAM PATTERSON.

582
00:39:55,425 --> 00:39:57,478
>> WHAT'S UP COLIN.
>> WHAT'S UP KAM?

583
00:39:57,478 --> 00:39:59,250
>> LISTEN, I THINK DIDDY IS WEIRD

584
00:39:59,250 --> 00:40:01,721
BUT I ACTUALLY HAVE
SOMETHING MORE PRESSING TO TALK
ABOUT.

585
00:40:01,721 --> 00:40:03,285
LET'S GET DOWN TO BUSINESS.

586
00:40:03,285 --> 00:40:06,236
I'VE BEEN HERE 45 MINUTES NOW,

587
00:40:06,236 --> 00:40:09,259
WHEN ARE YOU
GOING TO LET ME SAY THE N-WORD?

588
00:40:09,259 --> 00:40:11,611
>> YOU WANT TO SAY THE N-WORD?

589
00:40:11,611 --> 00:40:15,730
>> YOU MEAN THE WORD I SAID IN
MY ACT 150 TIMES BEFORE MY
SECOND JOKE?

590
00:40:15,730 --> 00:40:17,065
YES.

591
00:40:17,065 --> 00:40:20,522
WHEN Y'ALL GOING TO LET ME
LOOSE?
I FEEL LIKE I'M SHACKLED TO THIS
DESK, MAN.

592
00:40:20,522 --> 00:40:23,169
>> DON'T PUT IT LIKE THAT.
I MEAN --

593
00:40:23,169 --> 00:40:26,035
YOU CAN'T SAY THE
N-WORD ON THE SHOW, YOU GET
FINED.

594
00:40:26,035 --> 00:40:27,659
>> THAT'S FINE, I'LL PAY IT.

595
00:40:27,659 --> 00:40:30,000
>> THAT'S LIKE HALF A MILLION
DOLLARS.

596
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,353
>> THAT'S FINE, YOU'LL PAY IT.

597
00:40:32,353 --> 00:40:34,663
>> I'M NOT PAYING HALF A MILLION
DOLLARS.

598
00:40:34,663 --> 00:40:37,050
>> COLIN, I'M A STAND-UP
COMEDIAN FROM FLORIDA,

599
00:40:37,050 --> 00:40:38,642
SAYING
THAT WORD IS WHAT I DO.

600
00:40:38,642 --> 00:40:42,812
COME ON BRA, THIS IS
EXACTLY WHAT JIMMY KIMMEL FOUGHT
FOR.

601
00:40:43,131 --> 00:40:47,029
>> NO, IT'S NOT WHAT JIMMY
KIMMEL FOUGHT FOR.

602
00:40:47,029 --> 00:40:48,997
IT IS NOT SOMETHING WE REALLY DO
HERE.

603
00:40:48,997 --> 00:40:50,846
>> REALLY?
I'VE DONE MY RESEARCH

604
00:40:50,846 --> 00:40:53,629
AND IT'S
BEEN SAID A FEW TIMES ON THIS
SHOW.

605
00:40:53,629 --> 00:40:55,371
YOU KNOW WHAT, ROLL THE CLIP.

606
00:40:55,371 --> 00:40:58,356
>> DON'T ROLL ANY CLIPS.

607
00:40:58,356 --> 00:41:00,448
IT WAS A LONG TIME AGO, REALLY?

>> YEAH, BUT I'M GROWN.

610
00:41:05,629 --> 00:41:09,555
>> I JUST THINK YOU BRING MORE
TO THE TABLE THAN JUST THAT.

611
00:41:09,555 --> 00:41:12,279
>> PEOPLE ON THE INTERNET WOULD
DISAGREE.

612
00:41:12,279 --> 00:41:15,655
YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN SOME OF THE
STUFF THEY WROTE ABOUT ME

WHICH I DID READ BECAUSE I READ
WELL AND I'M READING RIGHT NOW.

614
00:41:20,099 --> 00:41:22,802
>> I MEAN,
YOUR CARDS ARE BLANK.

615
00:41:22,802 --> 00:41:25,452
>> MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS,
COLIN!

616
00:41:25,452 --> 00:41:29,274
LOOK.
I REALLY AM EXCITED TO BE HERE,
AND THE EXPECTATIONS PEOPLE HAVE
ABOUT ME.

I HAVE A LOT OF CHARACTERS I'M
EXCITED TO PLAY.

BOOM BROTHER, EXCEPT I WOULD
SAY -- YOU KNOW.

SAY

624
00:41:51,682 --> 00:41:56,229
>> KAM, WE WANT YOU TO EXPRESS
YOURSELF BUT MAYBE NOT SAY IT
TONIGHT, OKAY?

625
00:41:56,229 --> 00:41:57,869
>> THAT'S COOL.

626
00:41:57,869 --> 00:41:59,466
I'LL HOLD OFF FOR NOW.

627
00:41:59,466 --> 00:42:01,290
BUT IT'S LIKE JURASSIC PARK,

628
00:42:01,290 --> 00:42:03,263
YOU CAN PUT
UP ALL THE FENCES YOU WANT,

629
00:42:03,263 --> 00:42:05,749
BUT
A DINOSAUR IS STILL GOING TO GET
OUT.

HE SAID NEW YORK, WILL YOU
ACCEPT THIS ROLE?

634
00:42:29,101 --> 00:42:34,373
NOT TO BE OUTDONE, ANDREW

THE AI GENERATED ACTRESS GOT HER START

638
00:42:49,770 --> 00:42:54,273
AFTER SHE HAD A
HOTEL MEETING WITH AI HARVEY
WEINSTEIN.

639

MARRIAGE.

646
00:43:21,664 --> 00:43:27,133
I'M SADDENED AND SHOCKED THAT A

ANIMALS?

654
00:43:58,382 --> 00:44:01,246

CALLED EMMA
WATSON IGNORANT AND OUT OF TOUCH

659

AFTER SHE REFUSED TO DEFEND
ROWLING'S CONTROVERSIAL STANCE

662
00:44:29,068 --> 00:44:31,172
>> DOBBY, YOU OKAY?
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE SCARED.

663
00:44:31,172 --> 00:44:33,989
>> WHY WOULD BE DOBBY BE SCARED, SIR,

664
00:44:33,989 --> 00:44:39,118
DOBBY IS ABOUT TO PUBLICLY
WEIGH IN ON TRANS PEOPLE, THAT'S
ALL.

665
00:44:39,118 --> 00:44:41,036
>> DO YOU REALLY HAVE TO?

666
00:44:41,036 --> 00:44:44,283
>> YES, SIR, MASTER SENDS DOBBY
TO GO ON THE TELLY

00:44:44,283 --> 00:44:49,052
AND DEFINE
ONCE AND FOR ALL WHAT A WOMAN
IS.

668
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:51,806
>> FIRST OF ALL, I DON'T LOVE
MASTER.

669
00:44:51,806 --> 00:44:53,896
REALLY DON'T.

670
00:44:53,896 --> 00:44:56,867
ALSO, IS YOUR MASTER JK
ROWLING?
>> WHY, OF COURSE SIR.

671
00:44:56,867 --> 00:45:00,181
OH, NO, DOBBY WASN'T SUPPOSED TO
SAY.

672
00:45:00,181 --> 00:45:03,779
BAD DOBBY!
BAD DOBBY!
BAD DOBBY!

673
00:45:03,779 --> 00:45:05,557
>> DON'T DO THAT, YOU'RE HURTING
YOURSELF.

674
00:45:05,557 --> 00:45:08,225
>> DOBBY HAD TO SELF-PUNISH

675
00:45:08,225 --> 00:45:10,327
YOU SEE BECAUSE AFTER ROWLING
HAS DONE SO --

676
00:45:10,327 --> 00:45:12,905
DOBBY HAS COME
UNDONE.

677
00:45:17,642 --> 00:45:20,555
>> DOBBY.

MY FATIGUES ARE NOT WELL MADE.

679
00:45:24,802 --> 00:45:30,228
MASTER ROWLING HAS DONE SO MUCH
FOR DOBBY AND FOR INCLUSION IN
GENERAL.

680
00:45:30,228 --> 00:45:33,816
REMEMBER WHEN DUMBLEDORE WAS GAY
AFTER THE BOOKS CAME OUT?

681
00:45:33,816 --> 00:45:37,465
AND WHEN
HERMIONE WAS BLACK ONLY ON
BROADWAY?

682
00:45:37,465 --> 00:45:40,415
AND WHEN CHO CHANG WAS --

683
00:45:40,415 --> 00:45:43,006
HMM, WAS CHO CHANG ASIAN?

684
00:45:43,006 --> 00:45:48,211
DOBBY CAN'T REMEMBER IF THE
CHARACTER NAMED CHO CHANG WAS
ASIAN OR NOT.

685
00:45:48,211 --> 00:45:50,154
>> ALL RIGHT, DOBBY, WE GET IT.

686
00:45:50,154 --> 00:45:54,351
>> THE POINT IS, DOBBY CAME HERE
TO SAY THAT WOMEN HAVE VAGINAS

687
00:45:54,351 --> 00:45:57,419
AND WOMEN'S BATHROOMS ARE FOR WOMEN ONLY

688
00:45:57,419 --> 00:46:00,715
AND GIRLS AND GHOSTS
OF GIRLS.

689
00:46:00,715 --> 00:46:04,963
>> I DON'T EVEN GET THAT BECAUSE
I NEVER READ THEM CORNY ASS
BOOKS.

690
00:46:04,963 --> 00:46:08,070
>> OF COURSE SIR, DOBBY NEVER
MEANT TO IMPLY

691
00:46:08,070 --> 00:46:11,176
THAT MR. CHE IS
UNCOOL.

692
00:46:11,176 --> 00:46:13,177
>> IT'S FINE.
DON'T

693
00:46:13,177 --> 00:46:14,855
HE'S VERY COOL,

694
00:46:14,855 --> 00:46:18,529
HE GOES TO STRIP
CLUBS AND YANKEES GAMES.

695
00:46:18,529 --> 00:46:20,812
UNLIKE DOBBY.

696
00:46:20,812 --> 00:46:25,577
OH, NO, DOBBY IS MILLENNIAL
CRINGE!

697
00:46:26,554 --> 00:46:28,325
OH, NO!

698
00:46:28,325 --> 00:46:32,157
BAD DOBBY, BAD DOBBY!
CRINGE DOBBY!

699
00:46:32,157 --> 00:46:35,813
>> WHY DO YOU KEEP HURTING
YOURSELF?

700
00:46:35,813 --> 00:46:37,312
IT'S NOT RIGHT.

701
00:46:37,312 --> 00:46:40,473
>> WHY?
DOBBY DOESN'T KNOW.

702
00:46:40,473 --> 00:46:45,403
PERHAPS THAT'S WHAT HOUSE ELVES
WERE TAUGHT WE'RE ALWAYS THE PROBLEM,

703
00:46:45,403 --> 00:46:48,217
EVEN AS A 10th OF THE
POPULATION.

704
00:46:48,217 --> 00:46:52,133
BUT WE'RE NOT
THE VICTIM, MASTER ROWLING IS.

705
00:46:52,134 --> 00:46:53,992
HATE MAIL

706
00:46:53,992 --> 00:46:59,774
JUST RECEIVED THIS T-SHIRT
SAYING THEY K ROWLING.

707
00:47:00,606 --> 00:47:04,040
NOW IT'S DOBBY'S NICEST
SHIRTS.

708
00:47:04,040 --> 00:47:09,563
>> HEY, DOBBY, I HAVE READ THE
BOOKS.

709
00:47:09,563 --> 00:47:13,049
>> AND YOUR MASTER GAVE YOU A
PIECE OF CLOTHING,

710
00:47:13,049 --> 00:47:14,555
DOESN'T THAT MEAN YOU'RE

711
00:47:14,555 --> 00:47:16,623
FREE?

712
00:47:21,128 --> 00:47:27,697
>> YOU MEAN, DOBBY IS FINALLY
FREE TO SAY WHATEVER CHO/CHANG
THINKS?

713
00:47:27,697 --> 00:47:30,567
>> YOUR REAL PRONOUNS ARE
CHO/CHANG?

714
00:47:30,567 --> 00:47:34,149
>> LISTEN UP, WORLD, DOBBY HAS
SOMETHING TO SAY.

715
00:47:34,149 --> 00:47:38,007
GRINDLEWALD'S WORST CRIME WAS
SODOMY.

716

AND THEIR OWN LANGUAGE EMERGES
TO UNITE THEIR PEOPLE

721
00:48:22,157 --> 00:48:24,113
WITH A COMMON
TONGUE.

722
00:48:25,079 --> 00:48:26,764

726
00:48:36,062 --> 00:48:38,834
>> BUT I WAS THINKING,

727
00:48:38,834 --> 00:48:43,123
WHAT IF WE MADE IT HARDER TO LEARN.

728
00:48:43,123 --> 00:48:47,056
SO I HAD AN AMAZING IDEA.

729
00:48:47,056 --> 00:48:49,838

733
00:49:04,208 --> 00:49:08,409
AND HERE IS WHAT WE DECIDED SO
FAR.

734
00:49:10,948 --> 00:49:14,662
>> THE FIRST WORD IS MORNING.
