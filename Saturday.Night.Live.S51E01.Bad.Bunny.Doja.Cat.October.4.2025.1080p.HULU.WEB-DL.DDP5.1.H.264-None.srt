1
00:00:01,551 --> 00:00:04,803
EARLIER

2
00:00:04,803 --> 00:00:07,992
BRILLIANT IDEA TO GATHER ALL OF
OUR NATION'S TOP GENERALS

3
00:00:07,992 --> 00:00:09,662
IN ONE
PLACE AT ONE TIME.

4
00:00:09,662 --> 00:00:11,836
TO THROW OUR ENEMIES OFF THE SCENT,

5
00:00:11,836 --> 00:00:14,993
HE TOLD THEM EXACTLY
WHERE AND WHEN IT WOULD HAPPEN.

6
00:00:14,993 --> 00:00:17,688
WE TAKE YOU TO THIS MEETING NOW.

7
00:00:22,804 --> 00:00:25,187
>> TEN HUT!

8
00:00:25,341 --> 00:00:26,917
WELCOME, GENERALS.

9
00:00:27,099 --> 00:00:31,265
YOU HAVE ALL DEDICATED YOUR
LIVES TO DEFENDING THIS NATION.

10
00:00:31,265 --> 00:00:34,250
AS A REWARD, YOU WILL NOW BE YELLED AT

11
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:36,837
BY A FORMER FOX NEWS
HOST.

12
00:00:36,837 --> 00:00:40,891
PLEASE WELCOME THE SECRETARY OF WAR,

13
00:00:40,891 --> 00:00:43,008
PETE HEGSETH.

14
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:53,788
>> YEAH.

15
00:00:53,788 --> 00:00:55,754
CUT THE CRAP!

16
00:00:57,136 --> 00:00:59,194
LISTEN UP, EVERYONE, OKAY?

17
00:00:59,194 --> 00:01:04,804
I SUMMONED YOU ALL HERE TODAY TO
ADDRESS A SERIOUS PROBLEM.
OKAY?

18
00:01:04,804 --> 00:01:09,006
OUR MILITARY IS GAY
AS HELL.

19
00:01:09,617 --> 00:01:12,763
I'M NOT JUST TALKING ABOUT THE
NAVY.

20
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:17,234
THANKS TO FAILED LIBERAL POLICIES,

21
00:01:17,234 --> 00:01:19,793
OUR ARMY HAS NEVER BEEN GAYER,

22
00:01:19,793 --> 00:01:23,657
AND YET IT'S ALSO
NEVER BEEN FATTER.

23
00:01:23,657 --> 00:01:26,387
MAKE THAT MAKE SENSE.

24
00:01:26,387 --> 00:01:28,855
AM I RIGHT?

25
00:01:31,578 --> 00:01:34,118
YOU ALL ARE FUN.

26
00:01:34,118 --> 00:01:39,498
FROM NOW ON, OUR FIGHTING MEN
AND I GUESS WOMEN

27
00:01:39,498 --> 00:01:43,393
ARE GOING TO
ADHERE TO THE HIGHEST MALE
STANDARDS,

28
00:01:43,393 --> 00:01:47,390
WHICH HAVE BEEN SET
BY OUR PRESIDENT, DONALD TRUMP.

29
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:51,328
6'6".
BUCK 75.

30
00:01:51,328 --> 00:01:54,381
A-CUPS, PERKY,

31
00:01:54,381 --> 00:01:58,794
WITH A DUMPTRUCK
IN THE BACK YOU WOULDN'T EVEN
BELIEVE.

32
00:01:58,794 --> 00:02:01,960
AND HEY, YOU DON'T WANT TO LOSE
THE WEIGHT?

33
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,745
YOU DON'T WANT TO FOLLOW THE
RULES,

34
00:02:03,745 --> 00:02:08,265
NO PROBLEM.
YOU KNOW WHO IS GOING TO WANT
YOUR SICK, TWISTED FAT ASS?

35
00:02:08,265 --> 00:02:09,877
I.C.E.

36
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:14,216
WE HAVE A SIGN-UP SHEET IN THE
HALLWAY, CHECK THEM OUT.

37
00:02:14,216 --> 00:02:19,573
IN HERE WE'RE
DOING ARMY AND ONLY ARMY.

38
00:02:19,573 --> 00:02:22,489
AND WE'RE GOING TO BE DOING IT
IN ONE OF THE BLOODIEST,

39
00:02:22,489 --> 00:02:25,233
WAR-TORN PLACES ON FACE OF THE EARTH --

40
00:02:25,233 --> 00:02:27,891
PORTLAND, OREGON.

41
00:02:28,285 --> 00:02:31,388
NOW BACK TO THE FAT THING.

42
00:02:31,888 --> 00:02:36,907
OUR MILITARY WILL NOW HAVE THE
SAME RULES AS ANY GOOD FRAT
PARTY.

43
00:02:36,907 --> 00:02:39,610
NO FAT CHICKS.

44
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:45,129
IF YOU'RE A FAT DUDE, GODDAMN
IT, YOU BETTER BE FUNNY AS HELL.

45
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:50,634
IN SUMMARY -- THIS IS THE WHOLE MEETING,

46
00:02:50,634 --> 00:02:55,055
NO FUGGOS, NO FATTIES,

47
00:02:55,055 --> 00:02:58,414
NO FACIAL HAIR, NO BODY
HAIR.

48
00:02:58,414 --> 00:03:02,596
JUST HOT, SHREDDED, HAIRLESS MEN

49
00:03:02,596 --> 00:03:06,218
WHO ARE DEFINITELY NOT GAY.

50
00:03:06,218 --> 00:03:08,529
BECAUSE THIS IS SERIOUS.

51
00:03:08,529 --> 00:03:12,051
WE ARE FACING THE
GREATEST THREAT TO FREEDOM AND
DEMOCRACY

52
00:03:12,051 --> 00:03:13,569
THE WORLD HAS EVER KNOWN

53
00:03:13,569 --> 00:03:16,097
AND WE ALL KNOW WHAT THAT
THREAT IS.

54
00:03:16,097 --> 00:03:18,913
>> LATE NIGHT TV.

55
00:03:18,913 --> 00:03:22,525
WELL, HELLO, GOOD TO BE HERE.

56
00:03:22,525 --> 00:03:25,838
YES, IT'S ME, YOUR FAVORITE
PRESIDENT.

57
00:03:25,838 --> 00:03:28,222
I'M LIKE THE LATE, GREAT
BEETLEJUICE.

58
00:03:28,222 --> 00:03:31,697
YOU SAY
MY NAME ZERO TIMES AND I APPEAR.

59
00:03:31,697 --> 00:03:34,890
I'M JUST HERE KEEPING AN EYE ON SNL

60
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:37,870
MAKING SURE THEY DON'T DO
ANYTHING TOO MEAN ABOUT ME.

61
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:39,383
THEY BETTER BE CAREFUL,

62
00:03:39,383 --> 00:03:43,891
I KNOW LATE NIGHT
TV LIKE THE BACK OF MY HANDS,

63
00:03:43,891 --> 00:03:46,345
NOT LOOKING GREAT RIGHT NOW.

64
00:03:46,455 --> 00:03:47,777
DON'T LOOK AT THAT.

65
00:03:47,777 --> 00:03:50,728
GOING TO COVER THIS UP FOR THE
REST OF MY LIFE.

66
00:03:50,728 --> 00:03:53,639
SNL 51 ALREADY OFF TO A ROUGH
START.

67
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:55,806
17 NEW CAST MEMBERS

68
00:03:55,806 --> 00:03:58,931
AND THEY GOT
THE UPDATE GUY DOING THE OPEN.

69
00:03:58,931 --> 00:04:02,026
WOW, LOOK AT COLIN, POOR COLIN.

70
00:04:02,026 --> 00:04:05,931
WE ALL KNOW THEY WERE NEVER
GOING TO LET HIM DO THE WHOLE
OPENING BY HIMSELF.

71
00:04:05,931 --> 00:04:09,785
CAN'T EVEN DO UPDATE BY HIMSELF,
HE NEEDS MICHAEL CHE.

72
00:04:09,785 --> 00:04:11,731
I NEED MY CHE.

73
00:04:11,731 --> 00:04:14,017
FRANKLY I'M SURPRISED COLIN'S HERE,

74
00:04:14,017 --> 00:04:18,274
I THOUGHT HE WOULD BE WITH
HIS FRIENDS AT THE RIYADH COMEDY
FESTIVAL.

75
00:04:18,274 --> 00:04:20,828
>> I DIDN'T GET AN OFFER.

76
00:04:20,828 --> 00:04:24,285
>> THAT'S SAD.
WE LOVE THE SAUDIS

77
00:04:24,285 --> 00:04:27,440
BECAUSE THEY
LIKE TO SAW THESE JOURNALISTS IN
HALF.

78
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,868
THAT'S THE KIND OF THING THAT
WOULD KILL OVER THERE.

79
00:04:29,868 --> 00:04:31,307
ALL RIGHT, COLIN,

80
00:04:31,307 --> 00:04:34,905
THOSE SPIRIT AIRLINES JOKES
AREN'T GOING TO WRITE
THEMSELVES.

81
00:04:34,905 --> 00:04:36,139
BYE.

82
00:04:36,139 --> 00:04:41,630
OH, AND COLIN, MAY EVERY DAY BE
ANOTHER WONDERFUL SECRET.

83
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:44,383
THAT WAS A QUOTE FROM A POEM

84
00:04:44,383 --> 00:04:47,121
I WROTE TO A
HORRIBLE MAN I'VE NEVER MET
BEFORE.

85
00:04:47,121 --> 00:04:50,837
BUT HERE WE ARE, "SNL" SEASON 51,

86
00:04:50,837 --> 00:04:53,343
SHOULD HAVE CALLED IT AT 50,
RIGHT?

87
00:04:53,343 --> 00:04:56,371
IT'S SO SAD TO SEE SOMETHING GET
OLD AND CONFUSED

88
00:04:56,371 --> 00:04:59,306
 YET STILL
DEMAND CONSTANT ATTENTION.

89
00:04:59,306 --> 00:05:00,949
OH, WELL.

90
00:05:00,949 --> 00:05:04,373
BUT THEY BETTER BE ON THEIR BEST
BEHAVIOR, OTHERWISE THEY'RE
GOING TO HAVE TO ANSWER

91
00:05:04,373 --> 00:05:09,421
 TO MY
ATTACK DOG AT THE FCC, BRANDON
CARR.

92
00:05:16,368 --> 00:05:20,369
ALL RIGHT.
THANKS BRANDON.

93
00:05:23,206 --> 00:05:25,733
>> IT'S ACTUALLY BRENDAN, SIR.

94
00:05:25,733 --> 00:05:28,959
>> IT'S CRAZY THAT YOU THINK I
CARE.
BYE.

95
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:30,995
YOU GOT TO STOP.

96
00:05:30,995 --> 00:05:33,193
WELL, I HAD A GREAT SUMMER,

97
00:05:33,193 --> 00:05:36,042
I TOOK A LITTLE VACATION TIME
FOR GOLF AND TRAVEL 

98
00:05:36,042 --> 00:05:37,771
AND STROKE.

99
00:05:37,771 --> 00:05:38,840
KIDDING.

100
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:41,313
OR NOT.
WE'LL NEVER KNOW, WILL WE?

101
00:05:41,313 --> 00:05:46,162
WHAT ELSE, I ENDED EVERY WAR,

102
00:05:46,162 --> 00:05:50,381
EXCEPT THE TWO MAIN ONES STILL
HAPPENING AND MORE VICIOUS THAN
EVER.

103
00:05:50,381 --> 00:05:55,356
NOW STARTING A NEW WAR IN
VENEZUELA SOON,

104
00:05:55,356 --> 00:05:59,756
 THAT'S VERY
EXCITING AND THEY ASK HOW ARE
YOU GOING TO WAY FOR ALL THIS,

105
00:05:59,756 --> 00:06:02,552
AND I TELL THEM,
WITH MY SCAMS.

106
00:06:02,552 --> 00:06:05,214
MY BEAUTIFUL SCAMS.

107
00:06:05,214 --> 00:06:09,122
OUR NEXT ONE IS TRUMPRX, MY OWN
PHARMACY.

108
00:06:09,122 --> 00:06:11,891
LIKE
WE'VE GOT EVERYTHING, 

109
00:06:11,891 --> 00:06:15,428
HAIR PILLS, BONER PILLS, END OF LIST.

110
00:06:15,428 --> 00:06:19,395
I GUESS I'LL LET THEM START THE
SHOW.
THE CREW IS READY TO GO.

111
00:06:19,395 --> 00:06:23,028
THANK YOU "SNL" CREW FOR YOUR
HARD WORK AND YOUR VOTES.

112
00:06:23,028 --> 00:06:27,830
KEEP AN EYE ON MARCELLO FOR ME,
RIGHT?

113
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:30,699
GOOD, FANTASTIC.

114
00:06:30,699 --> 00:06:34,528
HERE WE GO,
AND JUST REMEMBER, DADDY'S
WATCHING, 

115
00:06:34,528 --> 00:06:38,792
AND LIVE FROM
NEW YORK, IT'S SATURDAY NIGHT!

116
00:08:41,505 --> 00:08:45,347
MUSICAL GUEST DOJA CAT,

117
00:08:46,393 --> 00:08:50,318
AND YOUR HOST, BAD BUNNY!

118
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:59,076
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, BAD BUNNY!

119
00:09:22,801 --> 00:09:26,665
THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU,

120
00:09:26,665 --> 00:09:28,720
IT'S SO GOOD TO BE BACK.

121
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,541
THIS IS MY SECOND TIME HOSTING

122
00:09:32,541 --> 00:09:35,896
AND
MY FOURTH TIME BEING HERE.

123
00:09:35,896 --> 00:09:37,916
AND I THINK MARCELLO IS GETTING NERVOUS

124
00:09:37,916 --> 00:09:41,314
 THAT LORNE HAS A NEW
FAVORITE LATINO.

125
00:09:42,363 --> 00:09:44,707
>> I AM.

126
00:09:45,154 --> 00:09:49,523
>> THIS TIME I'M ONLY HOSTING
BECAUSE I NEED A REST.

127
00:09:49,523 --> 00:09:55,108
I JUST FINISHED A 31-SHOW
RESIDENCY IN PUERTO RICO

128
00:09:56,770 --> 00:10:03,135
 AND I'M
STILL KIND OF TIRED BECAUSE THE
SHOWS ARE THREE HOURS LONG 

129
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:08,910
AND
THERE'S A LOT OF COMPLICATED
CHOREOGRAPHY, LIKE THIS.

130
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:19,715
THAT LOOKED
SIMPLE, BUT 

131
00:10:19,715 --> 00:10:23,719
THAT TOOK ME A LONG
TIME TO LEARN.
TRUST ME.

132
00:10:23,719 --> 00:10:33,315
ANYWAYS, MY RESIDENCY WAS

133
00:10:33,317 --> 00:10:34,349
BEAUTIFUL, EVERYONE LOVED IT.

134
00:10:34,351 --> 00:10:37,085
SOME CELEBRITIES CAME TO MY

135
00:10:37,087 --> 00:10:41,890
SHOW.

136
00:10:41,892 --> 00:10:44,592
FEW OF THEM WERE ON DRUGS.

137
00:10:44,594 --> 00:10:53,168
AND I DON'T WANT TO SAY WHO, BUT

138
00:10:53,170 --> 00:10:57,105
THIS WAS JON HAMM.

139
00:10:57,107 --> 00:11:10,652
ACTUALLY, ACTUALLY, THAT WASN'T

140
00:11:10,654 --> 00:11:15,490
JON HAMM, THAT WAS JUAN JAMON.

141
00:11:15,492 --> 00:11:16,558
I THINK HE'S OBSESSED WITH ME.

142
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,193
ANYWAY, YOU MIGHT NOT KNOW THIS,

143
00:11:18,195 --> 00:11:25,233
BUT I'M DOING THE SUPER BOWL

144
00:11:25,235 --> 00:11:27,402
HALFTIME SHOW.

145
00:11:27,404 --> 00:11:33,842
AND I'M VERY HAPPY, AND I THINK

146
00:11:33,844 --> 00:11:35,477
EVERYONE IS HAPPY ABOUT IT.

147
00:11:35,479 --> 00:11:36,010
EVEN FOX NEWS.

148
00:11:36,012 --> 00:11:37,112
>> BAD BUNNY.

149
00:11:37,114 --> 00:11:38,146
>> IS.

150
00:11:38,148 --> 00:11:39,214
>> MY FAVORITE.

151
00:11:39,216 --> 00:11:39,748
>> MUSICIAN.

152
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:48,289
>> AND HE SHOULD BE THE NEXT.

153
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:51,760
>> PRESIDENT.

154
00:11:51,762 --> 00:11:53,395
>> WOW, THANK YOU.

155
00:11:53,397 --> 00:11:54,462
NO, REALLY, I'M VERY EXCITED TO

156
00:11:54,464 --> 00:11:57,465
BE DOING THE SUPER BOWL.

157
00:11:57,467 --> 00:11:58,433

PRESIDENT TRUMP CLAIMED THAT ONE

788
00:36:30,589 --> 00:36:33,790
OF THE REASONS THE GOVERNMENT

789
00:36:33,792 --> 00:36:35,959
SHUT DOWN IS BECAUSE DEMOCRATS

790

WANT TRANSGENDER FOR EVERYBODY.

791
00:36:37,596 --> 00:36:40,497

I'M NOT GOING TO READ IT, IT WAS

821
00:37:49,701 --> 00:37:52,268
CRAZY TO HEAR FROM A PRESIDENT

822
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:53,336
BUT FUN FROM ANYONE ELSE.

823
00:37:53,338 --> 00:37:54,070
LET ME SHOW YOU WHAT I MEAN IN

824
00:37:54,072 --> 00:37:54,804
OUR NEW SEGMENT, PRESIDENT TRUMP

825
00:37:54,806 --> 00:37:55,538

826

HE SOUNDED LIKE JENNIFER

827

COOLIDGE.

828
00:38:00,579 --> 00:38:03,947

BE COOL WHEN YOU WALK DOWN BUT

830
00:38:04,683 --> 00:38:05,248
DON'T DOWN THE STAIRS.

831
00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:08,551
ONE THING WITH OBAMA, I HAVE

832
00:38:08,553 --> 00:38:11,087
ZERO RESPECT FOR HIM AS A

833
00:38:11,089 --> 00:38:13,656

00:43:58,069 --> 00:44:04,374
BUT ISN'T ALL OF LONG ISLAND

1010
00:44:04,376 --> 00:44:05,074
REALLY JUST A ZOO FOR ABUSED

1011
00:44:05,076 --> 00:44:09,011
ANIMALS?

1014
00:44:12,417 --> 00:44:17,353
>> THAT'S NOT AN APPLAUSE BREAK.

1015
00:44:17,355 --> 00:44:18,421
>> IT ONLY TAKES ONE.

1016

1045
00:45:06,571 --> 00:45:07,703
BAD DOBBY!

00:45:07,705 --> 00:45:08,704
BAD DOBBY!

1047
00:45:08,706 --> 00:45:09,806
BAD DOBBY!

1048
00:45:09,808 --> 00:45:12,508
>> DON'T DO THAT, YOU'RE HURTING

1049
00:45:12,510 --> 00:45:17,380
YOURSELF.

1050
00:45:17,382 --> 00:45:20,516
>> DOBBY HAD TO SELF-PUNISH

1051
00:45:20,518 --> 00:45:23,352
YOU SEE BECAUSE AFTER ROWLING

1052
00:45:23,354 --> 00:45:24,053
HAS DONE SO -- DOBBY HAS COME

1053
00:45:24,055 --> 00:45:25,588
UNDONE.

1054
00:45:25,590 --> 00:45:27,824
>> DOBBY.

1055
00:45:27,826 --> 00:45:32,361
>> I'M SORRY.

1056
00:45:32,363 --> 00:45:34,096
MY FATIGUES ARE NOT WELL MADE.

1057
00:45:34,098 --> 00:45:36,199
MASTER ROWLING HAS DONE SO MUCH

1058
00:45:36,201 --> 00:45:36,933
FOR DOBBY AND FOR INCLUSION IN

1059
00:45:36,935 --> 00:45:38,668
GENERAL.

1060
00:45:38,670 --> 00:45:41,003
REMEMBER WHEN DUMBLEDORE WAS GAY

1061
00:45:41,005 --> 00:45:41,637
AFTER THE BOOKS CAME OUT?

1062
00:45:41,639 --> 00:45:41,971
AND WHEN

1063
00:45:41,973 --> 00:45:44,607
HERMIONE WAS BLACK ONLY ON

1064
00:45:44,609 --> 00:45:48,144
BROADWAY?

1065
00:45:48,146 --> 00:45:49,445
AND WHEN CHO CHANG WAS -- HMM,

1066
00:45:49,447 --> 00:45:49,979
WAS CHO CHANG ASIAN?

1067
00:45:49,981 --> 00:45:53,749
DOBBY CAN'T REMEMBER IF THE

1068
00:45:53,751 --> 00:45:54,617
CHARACTER NAMED CHO CHANG WAS

1069
00:45:54,619 --> 00:45:57,019
ASIAN OR NOT.

1070
00:45:57,021 --> 00:45:59,021
>> ALL RIGHT, DOBBY, WE GET IT.

1071
00:45:59,023 --> 00:46:02,058
>> THE POINT IS, DOBBY CAME HERE

1072
00:46:02,060 --> 00:46:03,860
TO SAY THAT WOMEN HAVE VAGINAS

1073
00:46:03,862 --> 00:46:07,630

1074
00:46:07,632 --> 00:46:08,364
WOMEN ONLY AND GIRLS AND GHOSTS

1075
00:46:08,366 --> 00:46:09,465
OF GIRLS.

1076
00:46:09,467 --> 00:46:15,571
>> I DON'T EVEN GET THAT BECAUSE

1077
00:46:15,573 --> 00:46:16,239
I NEVER READ THEM CORNY ASS

1078
00:46:16,241 --> 00:46:18,441

1079
00:46:18,443 --> 00:46:21,344
>> OF COURSE SIR, DOBBY NEVER

1080
00:46:21,346 --> 00:46:22,111
MEANT TO IMPLY THAT MR. CHE IS

1081
00:46:22,113 --> 00:46:26,516
UNCOOL.

1082
00:46:26,518 --> 00:46:35,591
>> IT'S FINE.

1083
00:46:35,593 --> 00:46:40,763
HE'S VERY COOL, HE GOES TO STRIP

1084
00:46:40,765 --> 00:46:41,364
CLUBS AND YANKEES GAMES.

1085
00:46:41,366 --> 00:46:41,797
UNLIKE DOBBY.

1086
00:46:41,799 --> 00:46:42,465

1087
00:46:42,467 --> 00:46:42,798

1092
00:46:50,408 --> 00:46:50,773
YOURSELF?

1093
00:46:50,775 --> 00:46:51,240
IT'S NOT RIGHT.

1094
00:46:51,242 --> 00:46:51,974
>> WHY DOES DOBBY HURT HIMSELF?

1095
00:46:51,976 --> 00:46:54,877
DOBBY DOESN'T KNOW.

1096
00:46:54,879 --> 00:46:57,847
PERHAPS THAT'S WHAT HOUSE ELVES

1097

GRINDLEWALD'S WORST CRIME WAS

1120
00:47:50,735 --> 00:47:52,868
SODOMY.

1121

1125
00:48:32,110 --> 00:48:32,475
TO

1126
00:48:32,477 --> 00:48:33,209
UNITE THEIR PEOPLE WITH A COMMON

1127

00:48:50,094 --> 00:48:52,328
WE MADE IT HARDER TO LEARN.

1134
00:48:52,330 --> 00:48:55,731
SO I HAD AN AMAZING IDEA.

1135
00:48:55,733 --> 00:48:56,132
