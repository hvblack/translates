[ Cheers and applause ]
Yes, hello. Hello, everyone.

6
00:00:22,971 --> 00:00:25,169
It is I, President and CEO

7
00:00:25,169 --> 00:00:29,112
of Gaza Hotel and Casino,
Donald Trump.

8
00:00:29,112 --> 00:00:34,129
And I'd like to welcome
President Zelensky here
to this incredible trap.

9
00:00:34,129 --> 00:00:36,272
It's going to be a big,
beautiful trap.

10
00:00:36,272 --> 00:00:40,139
And we're going to attack
him very soon for no reason.
Right, JD?

11
00:00:40,139 --> 00:00:43,557
Watch out.
'Cause this kitty's got claws.
Rawr!

00:00:43,992 --> 00:00:45,900
Very butch.

13
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:52,136
And Marco Rubio is here, too.
Little Marco.

14
00:00:52,136 --> 00:00:56,748
<i>Little Marco, are you excited
to attack our European ally?</i>

00:00:56,748 --> 00:00:59,567
Um, no English.

16
00:00:59,567 --> 00:01:01,730
De nada.

17
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:05,683
Before we get started,
I'd like to thank
President Zelensky

18
00:01:05,683 --> 00:01:09,079
for dressing
like casual "Star Trek."

19
00:01:09,079 --> 00:01:12,432
We love "Star Trek"
because there's no DEI.

20
00:01:12,432 --> 00:01:16,770
The White guy was the leader
and he bossed around Spock,

21
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:20,308
who I believe was Guatemalan.

22
00:01:20,308 --> 00:01:22,724
We love that.
President Zelensky,

23
00:01:22,724 --> 00:01:25,882
you want to say a few words,
maybe tell Mr. Putin

24
00:01:25,882 --> 00:01:29,325
how much you love him
and that you're sorry
you invaded Russia?

25
00:01:29,410 --> 00:01:32,377
Maybe you offer him
one night with your wife.

26
00:01:32,377 --> 00:01:36,142
Mr. President,
with all due respect--

27
00:01:36,142 --> 00:01:40,553
Excuse me. I'm sorry. What?

28
00:01:40,553 --> 00:01:43,519
I'm sorry.
I have to jump in here because
that's how we planned this.

29
00:01:43,519 --> 00:01:47,369
What happened to "thank you"?
Okay.
Remember "thank you"?

30
00:01:47,369 --> 00:01:51,895
You haven't said thank you to us
once in the past 15 seconds
I've been yelling at you.

31
00:01:51,895 --> 00:01:53,616
I've said thank you.

32
00:01:53,616 --> 00:01:58,844
You didn't say it now,
but you didn't say it now
when you walked in here,
you didn't say thank you.

33
00:01:58,844 --> 00:02:01,946
You didn't say anything about
us being handsome.

34
00:02:01,946 --> 00:02:05,893
Who are my handsome little boys?
You didn't ask us that once.

35
00:02:05,893 --> 00:02:09,420
Look, he's right,
and we're very handsome, okay?

36
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:15,288
Our ties are matching,
and they're growing,
frankly, by the minute.

37
00:02:15,288 --> 00:02:17,819
We don't even
have to dust in here anymore.

38
00:02:17,819 --> 00:02:20,640
The ties sweep away the dust.

39
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:24,798
And yet,
you don't compliment the ties.
You don't say thank you.

40
00:02:24,798 --> 00:02:27,320
You don't tell
us how hot we look. Okay?

41
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:31,016
You don't say,
"If I was gay,
I'd be all over you two." Okay?

42
00:02:31,016 --> 00:02:33,463
And we're supposed to help you?

43
00:02:33,463 --> 00:02:35,321
But if I could just say--

44
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:38,878
You have been talking
this entire time.

45
00:02:38,878 --> 00:02:42,062
I'm sorry. Does the sign outside
say "Ukraine House"?

46
00:02:42,062 --> 00:02:45,377
No, it says "America House."

47
00:02:45,377 --> 00:02:50,324
Oh. Oh, man.
Look at Rubio over there,
fully dissociating.

48
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:55,495
He looks like Homer Simpson
disappearing into that hedge.

49
00:02:55,495 --> 00:03:00,126
To quote
the late good Tom Petty.
He's free fallin'.

50
00:03:00,126 --> 00:03:01,799
I'm sorry if I--

51
00:03:01,799 --> 00:03:04,194
You know, you say you want to
end this war,

52
00:03:04,194 --> 00:03:07,072
but frankly,
you don't have the cards.
Okay,

53
00:03:07,072 --> 00:03:08,830
I have the cards.
All right?

54
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:11,506
I have Skip.
I have Draw Four.

55
00:03:11,506 --> 00:03:13,581
I have Reverse.

56
00:03:13,581 --> 00:03:17,858
I have Get Out of Jail Free.
The Supreme Court
gave me that one.

57
00:03:17,858 --> 00:03:22,351
I have Pikachu and
Charmander and Charizard.

58
00:03:22,351 --> 00:03:25,074
All I'm missing is a Charmeleon.

59
00:03:25,074 --> 00:03:28,982
But without us,
you don't have any of the cards.
Okay, you got no cards.

60
00:03:28,982 --> 00:03:32,975
You're playing poker,
and Putin's playing
Magic the Gathering.

61
00:03:32,975 --> 00:03:37,123
And the Russians
have been treated very badly
with respect to the war.

62
00:03:37,123 --> 00:03:40,032
And also, frankly, "Anora."
Right?

63
00:03:40,032 --> 00:03:43,540
Anora was misled,
and she fell in love.

64
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:46,937
And now she might
even lose to "Brutalist."

65
00:03:46,937 --> 00:03:48,487
It's disgusting.

66
00:03:48,487 --> 00:03:51,170
You know, maybe
you should come visit Ukraine.

67
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:53,399
Hey, don't you even dare.

68
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:57,313
I have been
to Ukraine on Google Maps.

69
00:03:57,313 --> 00:04:02,525
It's a mess.
You think you're getting
any money from us after your
little outburst today?

70
00:04:02,525 --> 00:04:05,174
To quote my personal hero,
Willy Wonka,

71
00:04:05,174 --> 00:04:11,259
"You broke the rules.
You get nothing, you lose.
Good day, sir."

72
00:04:11,259 --> 00:04:15,692
And you know what?
You're also--
You're not even wearing a suit.
It's disrespectful.

73
00:04:15,692 --> 00:04:21,136
Who shows up to the White House
in a T-shirt and jeans
like a garbage person?

87

88
00:05:28,774 --> 00:05:32,469

00:05:41,821 --> 00:05:44,054
They're doing mass firings
in the government.

92
00:05:44,054 --> 00:05:47,187
We love mass firings
because you don't have to know

93
00:05:47,187 --> 00:05:50,144
what any of their names are
or what exactly they do.

94
00:05:50,144 --> 00:05:54,468
I mean, w-w-we're not going to get
it perfect, you know?

95
00:05:54,468 --> 00:05:58,578
But we are firing the nonessential employees,

96
00:05:58,578 --> 00:06:02,269
like air traffic controllers.
Yes, yes.

97
00:06:02,269 --> 00:06:05,010
And sure, some of the planes
are going to land upside down,

98

It's official.

And, uh, Big Balls, you've
been doing some awesome
DOGE stuff, right, Big Balls?

103
00:06:26,071 --> 00:06:30,304
Oh, for sure.
This week I fired
a Black general
and a woman admiral.

104

{\an8}Or DOUCHE.
Yeah.

This was bumming me
out a little.

That kind of a bummer?

That was fun.

Uh-huh? Yeah.
You guys are having fun.
He's already hitting us with,

Greenland.
Ooh, now I want Greenland.

135
00:11:06,546 --> 00:11:09,700
I never even
thought about Greenland.
Now it's all I think about.

136
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:12,152
My favorite thing
with Trump wanting Greenland is,
you know, it's--

137
00:11:12,152 --> 00:11:14,781
you know how they call Greenland--

138
00:11:14,781 --> 00:11:18,667
The Vikings used to call
Greenland, Greenland and
Iceland, Iceland to, like,
keep people away.

139
00:11:18,667 --> 00:11:22,681
When in fact,
Greenland is ice and
Iceland is green.

140
00:11:22,681 --> 00:11:27,932
And I wonder if that trick,
Leif Erikson's trick
from a thousand years ago

141
00:11:27,932 --> 00:11:33,292
made it all the way to 2025,

142
00:11:33,292 --> 00:11:36,861
where Donald Trump was staring
at a map going,

Biden was fun. Also hilarious.

146
00:11:48,153 --> 00:11:52,809
My favorite thing about Biden
was anytime he was giving
a speech,

147
00:11:52,809 --> 00:11:56,513
in between teleprompters,
his face would go
back to being dead.

148
00:11:56,513 --> 00:11:59,229
Do you remember that?
He'd be out there like,
"Ah, ah."

149
00:12:01,991 --> 00:12:04,198
"I'm serious."

150
00:12:04,198 --> 00:12:07,380
Look, I get it. You guys are
pretty liberal here.

151
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:11,105
Look, I understand being
liberal, dude, it feels good.

152
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:15,017
It's powerful.
It's too powerful, dude.
It's like the Sith.

153
00:12:15,017 --> 00:12:18,591
You can, like,
lose yourself, dude.
Somebody says something you
don't like at work.

154
00:12:18,591 --> 00:12:19,847
You're like, "Ah, eh!"
[ Chuckles ]

155
00:12:22,823 --> 00:12:24,585
"Do it."

156
00:12:26,614 --> 00:12:30,249
All right, now I'm
going to lose you even more.

157
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:32,474
Uh, for my next trick...

158
00:12:32,474 --> 00:12:36,479
There's a-- There's a thing
I've noticed that White guys do,

159
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:41,367
and, uh, most White guys I know do it,
and nobody seems to be talking about it,

160
00:12:41,367 --> 00:12:44,098
all right?
And it is racist.

161
00:12:45,455 --> 00:12:49,878
All right? There's a thing
White guys do that,
whenever they're dating a woman
for the first time,

162
00:12:49,878 --> 00:12:54,146
they always ask 'em eventually,
"Have you ever, uh"...

163
00:12:54,146 --> 00:12:56,464
See, I didn't even finish.

164
00:12:56,464 --> 00:13:00,985
Every one of you.
It's a weird thing to ask.
You shouldn't do it.

165
00:13:00,985 --> 00:13:03,085
All right?
You got to find the right time
to ask, though.

166
00:13:03,085 --> 00:13:05,463
You don't want to go
too early with that.
You'll look like a psycho.

167
00:13:05,463 --> 00:13:09,841
You don't want to be, like,
on Tinder like,
"Have you ever had sex
with a Black guy bef--"

168
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:13,876
It's a shameful thing to ask.

169
00:13:14,672 --> 00:13:17,897
All right? It's weird.

170
00:13:17,897 --> 00:13:19,876
I've done it.

171
00:13:19,876 --> 00:13:21,629
I'm not proud.
I've done it.

172
00:13:21,629 --> 00:13:25,200
One time,
I was in the car with the girl
I was dating at the time.

173
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:27,509
We were driving home from
my friend Jamal's house.
All right?

174
00:13:27,509 --> 00:13:31,090
And out of nowhere,
the girl I was dating
at the time, she just goes,

175
00:13:31,090 --> 00:13:33,368
"Mm. Jamal's handsome."

176
00:13:33,368 --> 00:13:36,613
I was like,
all right, that's fine with me.

177
00:13:36,613 --> 00:13:40,097
I'm not insecure or racist
or whatever would make
me care about that.

178
00:13:40,097 --> 00:13:43,407
But she brought it up,
so now I can ask
without looking like a psycho.

179
00:13:43,407 --> 00:13:45,025
So I was like, "Have you ever,

180
00:13:45,025 --> 00:13:47,863
uh... would you ever... ever...

181
00:13:47,863 --> 00:13:49,947
Have you ever had sex
with a Black guy?"

182
00:13:49,947 --> 00:13:50,806
And she goes, "Ew, no."

183
00:13:50,806 --> 00:13:54,386
I was like, "Jesus Christ,
what are you, racist?"

184
00:13:57,790 --> 00:13:59,452
Hey.

185
00:14:00,316 --> 00:14:04,952
All right. I'll tell you this.
Now that I've got your
attention, I, uh...

186
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:08,254
I'm getting older.
I can tell I'm getting older

187
00:14:08,254 --> 00:14:11,721
because the only thing I watch
is historical documentaries.

188
00:14:11,721 --> 00:14:14,518
Every night I put on
historical documentaries.

189
00:14:14,518 --> 00:14:16,671
I also drink a lot,
so I don't--

190
00:14:16,671 --> 00:14:19,656
I haven't retained
one piece of information.

191
00:14:19,656 --> 00:14:21,383
I turn it on and I'm asleep.

192
00:14:21,383 --> 00:14:24,365
I've watched the same episode
of "World War II in HD."

193
00:14:24,365 --> 00:14:27,714
I'm on episode one.
I've been on episode
one for four years.

194
00:14:27,714 --> 00:14:30,344
I wake up at 4:00 AM.
It's still on,

195
00:14:30,344 --> 00:14:33,599
volume at 50.
Episode eight, "Stalingrad."

196
00:14:33,599 --> 00:14:36,843
Just wake up
to artillery every night.
Just, "Ah!"

197
00:14:37,655 --> 00:14:42,734
But my favorite
historical documentary is--
it's called
"Ken Burns' Civil War."
All right?

198
00:14:42,734 --> 00:14:46,655
"Ken Burns' Civil War,"
if you haven't seen it,
it's 900 hours long.

199
00:14:46,655 --> 00:14:49,496
No one on Earth
has ever finished it.

200
00:14:49,496 --> 00:14:51,828
It's also-- It's
Kryptonite to women.

201
00:14:51,828 --> 00:14:55,238
If you put that on,
they will fall
asleep immediately.

202
00:14:55,238 --> 00:14:58,958
You know, that's a little--
You know, they're yapping
a little, you go,
"How about some Ken Burns?"

203
00:14:58,958 --> 00:15:02,554
That's a little Cosby tip
for you, actually.

204
00:15:02,987 --> 00:15:06,697
Who needs roofies when we have
"Ken Burns Presents

205
00:15:06,697 --> 00:15:11,013
the History
of the Buffalo" on PBS.

206
00:15:11,013 --> 00:15:14,804
But "Ken Burns' Civil War"
is my favorite one.
It's the most boring thing
you've ever seen.

207
00:15:14,804 --> 00:15:16,465
Obviously, there's no footage.
It's the Civil War,

208
00:15:16,465 --> 00:15:20,803
so all they do
is just slowly zoom in on
black-and-white photos

209
00:15:20,803 --> 00:15:24,055
while historians talk,
and they give you
facts and information.

210
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:27,373
But there's one historian,
if you've ever seen it,
he's the funniest guy
in the whole thing.

211
00:15:27,373 --> 00:15:29,194
His name is Shelby Foote.
All right?

212
00:15:29,194 --> 00:15:33,282
Shelby is this old Southern guy
who's clearly
cheering for the South.

213
00:15:33,282 --> 00:15:36,182
The entire documentary.
Anytime he's talking, he's like,

214
00:15:36,182 --> 00:15:38,552
"Oh, the South had
some fine gentlemen."

215
00:15:38,552 --> 00:15:41,261
You're like, "All right,
Shelby, take it easy."

216
00:15:41,713 --> 00:15:45,052
But all the other
historians are at, like,
library desks or in an office.

217
00:15:45,052 --> 00:15:49,026
Shelby is in his living room,
and he's clearly freestyling.

218
00:15:49,026 --> 00:15:53,522
Everyone else is giving
you facts and dates.
Shelby's clearly just
making up stories.

219
00:15:53,522 --> 00:15:57,455
Every time the camera cuts
to him, he's like, "Well, now,

220
00:15:57,455 --> 00:16:01,914
after the Battle of Fredericksburg,
a couple of the Rebel soldiers,

221
00:16:01,914 --> 00:16:06,158
they got up on the ramparts
and they started yelling down
to the defeated Federal Army.

222
00:16:06,158 --> 00:16:10,387
They yelled out.
They said, 'Hey, Johnny Yank,
we whipped you today.'

223
00:16:10,387 --> 00:16:13,944
Now, the Yanks,
they didn't like that much.
So they yelled back.

224
00:16:13,944 --> 00:16:17,000
They said, 'Hey, Billy Reb,
we're gonna lick ya tomorrow.'"

225
00:16:17,773 --> 00:16:22,637
You go, what? Why'd you
just make up that story
in the middle of the show?

226
00:16:22,637 --> 00:16:25,251
I'm not a historian,
but I know that didn't happen.

227
00:16:25,251 --> 00:16:29,670
The guys without teeth or shoes.
Do you think that's
how they talk to each other
after they shot him?

228
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:32,168
"Oh, you pulled a fast one
on us the other day."

229
00:16:32,168 --> 00:16:34,616
No, that real conversation was
like, "Argh!"
[ Laughter ]

230
00:16:38,413 --> 00:16:41,480
All right. I don't know
how to get out of this joke,

231
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:45,293
but I really wanted to talk
Ken Burns with you folks.

232
00:16:45,293 --> 00:16:48,266
The only way I can think
to get out of it is Shelby--

233
00:16:48,266 --> 00:16:51,277
Shelby is the funniest guy
in the whole thing
because he loves--

234
00:16:51,277 --> 00:16:53,675
He's almost, like, sexual
how much he loves the South.

235
00:16:53,675 --> 00:16:56,942
Anytime he talks about 'em,
he's like,
"Oh, the women gathered in town

236
00:16:56,942 --> 00:17:01,558
when the Southern
soldiers marched through.
They loved the pageantry.

237
00:17:01,558 --> 00:17:06,905
I have here a love letter
written from a private
from Tennessee back
to his sweetheart.

238
00:17:06,905 --> 00:17:12,030
It reads, 'Dearest Clara,
tomorrow I go into battle.

239
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:14,244
I may never see you again.

240
00:17:14,244 --> 00:17:19,981
Oh, how I wish I could kiss
your sweet, supple lips
but one more time.

241
00:17:19,981 --> 00:17:26,310
Clara, before I go into battle,
I do have
but one question for you.

242
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:31,057
You ever, uh...
You ever'"--

243
00:17:31,057 --> 00:17:32,977
All right, all right.
That was fun.
You guys are great.

244
00:17:32,977 --> 00:17:37,113
We got a great show tonight.
Tate McRae is here.

245
00:17:37,113 --> 00:17:40,321
Stick around.
We'll be right back.

246
00:17:53,506 --> 00:17:58,077
Oh, honey, look at this view.
Not too shabby, eh, son?

247
00:17:58,078 --> 00:18:00,713
And I was talking
about the winery,
not the new girlfriend.

248
00:18:00,714 --> 00:18:04,116
All right, all right, Dad,
take it easy.
Stop. It's cute.

249
00:18:04,117 --> 00:18:09,021
And I just want to say thank
you guys for this trip
and being so lovely and

250
00:18:09,022 --> 00:18:13,592
for making James.
Aww.
Well, uh-oh, son. Red flag.

251
00:18:13,593 --> 00:18:16,562
She's too good for you.
Oh.
Don't I know it.

252
00:18:16,563 --> 00:18:21,033
Okay. And plus, your mom and
I already have something in
common-- Merlot.

253
00:18:21,034 --> 00:18:26,071
Ain't that right, sister?
Oh, Tessa, you are a doll.
Oh.

254
00:18:26,072 --> 00:18:29,775
Oh, my God,
is that an orange tree?
Oh, my God, I love those.

255
00:18:29,776 --> 00:18:33,045
Wait, baby,
baby, take a picture.
All right.

256
00:18:33,046 --> 00:18:38,385
Take a picture of me.
Okay. Sorry, Mom and Dad.
Time for my full-time job.

257
00:18:41,688 --> 00:18:45,290
Okay. Wait. Let me get--
Okay. Hold on. Wait. Okay.

258
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:49,561
Okay. Okay.
Okay. Take it.
[ Camera shutter clicks ]

259
00:18:49,562 --> 00:18:56,301
Okay. Uh, just one sec.
And there. It's great.
Okay. Can I see?

260
00:18:56,302 --> 00:19:00,439
Um, actually,
can you take another one?
Uh, for real?

261
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:04,209
Yeah. Yeah, baby.
This is what happens
when you have a hot girlfriend.

262
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:10,349
Maybe, like, um, do a series.
Yeah. What's a series?
Where you just keep pressing

263
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:15,421
the button, okay?
Okay. Hold on. Hold on.
Hold on. Closed mouth.

264
00:19:15,422 --> 00:19:23,162
[ Camera shutter clicking ]
Open mouth.
Laughing. [ Laughs ]

265
00:19:23,163 --> 00:19:29,034
Laughing again. [ Laughs ]
Oh.
And then one for the veterans.

266
00:19:29,035 --> 00:19:32,604
Oh.
Did you get it?
Yeah, I think I got it, babe.

267
00:19:32,605 --> 00:19:37,176
Okay. Awesome. Can I see?
Yeah.
Okay. Um, no. No.

268
00:19:37,177 --> 00:19:40,312
What are you doing?
These are bad.
What's wrong with these?

269
00:19:40,313 --> 00:19:44,616
You look hot.
You think I look hot?
I look like Michael Cera.

270
00:19:44,617 --> 00:19:49,922
Okay, tour's moving on,
y'all, we should--
Just take it. Hold it.

271
00:19:49,923 --> 00:19:52,691
Well, you just said hold it.
Hold it, just hold it.
You're not giving me

272
00:19:52,692 --> 00:19:59,064
any directions.
Okay, so the direction is...
be a man.

273
00:19:59,065 --> 00:20:03,135
You're not a baby boy anymore.
You're a big man.
Babe.

274
00:20:03,136 --> 00:20:09,808
Just say it.
Say, "I'm a big man who knows
how to take pictures."

275
00:20:09,809 --> 00:20:14,847
I'm a big man who knows
how to take pictures.
Okay, now take it.

276
00:20:14,848 --> 00:20:17,182
Yeah.
Hold it.
Get the top of my head,

277
00:20:17,183 --> 00:20:20,519
not my shoulders,
but then my legs.
How is that possible?

278
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:28,627
Okay.
And then, baby, do a boomerang.
[ Laughing ]

279
00:20:28,628 --> 00:20:33,766
Babe, that's scary.
It looks like you're
puking into your hands.

280
00:20:33,767 --> 00:20:36,802
You know, why don't we just
take a group picture and get
back on that tour, huh?

281
00:20:36,803 --> 00:20:40,272
Yeah, I think that's a great
idea.
[ Baby talk ] Babe...

282
00:20:40,273 --> 00:20:43,942
your parents are kind of ugly.
I'm sorry.
They are

283
00:20:43,943 --> 00:20:50,683
kind of ugly in the pictures.
I know they're kind of ugly,

[ Normal voice ] Yes.

I'm trying to take a picture
so we can go drink, girl.

287
00:21:06,466 --> 00:21:09,134
Well, gang, I think we got
what we need here.

288
00:21:09,135 --> 00:21:18,077
[ Stammering ] ...here
That's how you sound.
Babe, your parents are rough.

289
00:21:18,078 --> 00:21:21,113
Can we please go?
I'm sweating.
No, not until I get a picture

290
00:21:21,114 --> 00:21:25,684
of my hot boyfriend. Go.
All right. Just be nice.
Okay.

Okay. Okay.
Okay. Smile, babe.

Ew, ew, unh-unh, unh-unh, no.
Baby, baby. Hide your hands.
What's wrong--

293
00:21:37,697 --> 00:21:40,666
Baby, hide your hands now.
'Cause you look like a cartoon

Have a great day, gang.
You too, hon.

303
00:22:24,878 --> 00:22:29,767
You wouldn't know it,
but a few months ago,
anxiety and depression
were ruining my life.

304
00:22:29,767 --> 00:22:31,593
I was struggling at work.

305
00:22:31,593 --> 00:22:34,786
Hey, you need something, bud?

306
00:22:35,092 --> 00:22:37,229
I was struggling as a father.

307
00:22:37,229 --> 00:22:40,307
Gah! Come on, Andrew.
You can't be bad at school
and sports.

00:22:40,307 --> 00:22:41,592
And struggling as a husband.

309
00:22:41,592 --> 00:22:45,682
I'm upset because my mom's
doctor thinks
that we should move her
into an assisted living place.

310
00:22:45,682 --> 00:22:47,619
Oh, that's awesome.

311
00:22:47,619 --> 00:22:52,107
I was at a real low point.
That's when I talked to my
doctor about

312
00:22:52,107 --> 00:22:53,705
a CouplaBeers.

313
00:22:53,705 --> 00:22:58,296
A CouplaBeers
is a revolutionary medicine
that treats anxiety and
depression fast,

314
00:22:58,296 --> 00:23:01,052
and within minutes of taking it,
{\an8}I'm back to my old self.

315
00:23:01,052 --> 00:23:02,148
Andrew,

316
00:23:02,148 --> 00:23:04,305
I love you, buddy.
You're the best in the whole world.

317
00:23:04,305 --> 00:23:06,454
And my confidence is
through the roof.

Excuse me?

321
00:23:15,150 --> 00:23:19,805
Oh, sorry.
I'm just having a tough time
adjusting to my new medication, so...

322
00:23:20,022 --> 00:23:21,541
The way it works is simple.

323
00:23:21,541 --> 00:23:25,548
CouplaBeers quickly
turns a cloudy, rainy day
into a sunny one.

324
00:23:25,548 --> 00:23:26,575
It's that easy.

325
00:23:26,575 --> 00:23:28,532
{\an8}Now I'm the me I want to be.

326
00:23:28,532 --> 00:23:30,743
{\an8}And I'm not the only one
who's noticed the change.

She's just jealous 'cause
you're so beautiful.

329
00:23:39,668 --> 00:23:43,194
CouplaBeers
is a clinically proven treatment
for conditions like...

330
00:23:43,195 --> 00:23:45,089
Boredom
Depression

And if you miss a dose of
CouplaBeers, don't worry.

335
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:58,110
You won't.
Brother, you will never miss
a dose.

It's the kind of thing
the only thing
you really remember after a while

00:24:02,542 --> 00:24:03,951
is to take it.

338
00:24:03,951 --> 00:24:07,245
The most common side effect of
a CouplaBeers is drowsiness.

339
00:24:07,245 --> 00:24:11,131
So you may want to ask
your doctor about aLilBump.

340
00:24:11,131 --> 00:24:13,570
The way aLilBump works
is simple.

341
00:24:13,570 --> 00:24:16,040
Once the drowsiness of a
CouplaBeers sets in,

342
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:19,498
you simply take aLilBump
and let

It's "Weekend Update"
with Colin Jost and Michael Che.

607
00:41:49,409 --> 00:41:51,091
Good evening, everyone.

608
00:41:51,091 --> 00:41:53,545
Welcome to "Weekend Update." I'm Michael Che.

609
00:41:55,925 --> 00:41:59,040
I'm Colin Jost.

610
00:42:00,026 --> 00:42:02,389
I was worried I
was being set up again.
Okay.

611
00:42:02,389 --> 00:42:07,077
President Trump met
with Ukrainian president
Volodymyr Zelensky yesterday.

612
00:42:07,077 --> 00:42:08,309
Let's see how it went.

613
00:42:08,309 --> 00:42:11,376
You're gambling
with the lives of millions
of people.

614
00:42:11,376 --> 00:42:17,062
You're gambling
with World War III.
You're gambling with World War III.

615
00:42:17,062 --> 00:42:19,071
Pretty good.

616
00:42:19,227 --> 00:42:21,162
<i>And now, thanks to that meeting,</i>

617
00:42:21,162 --> 00:42:26,011
now you actually can gamble
on World War III on FanDuel.

618
00:42:26,361 --> 00:42:29,577
Trump repeatedly scolded
Zelensky,

619
00:42:29,577 --> 00:42:32,376
telling him,
"You have real problems."

620
00:42:32,376 --> 00:42:34,432
Yeah, man, he's in a war.

621
00:42:34,432 --> 00:42:39,333
No one's asking to borrow
missiles so they can take
the party to the next level.

622
00:42:39,333 --> 00:42:42,397
Zelensky was asked
to leave the White House.

623
00:42:42,397 --> 00:42:44,055
Then he appeared on Fox News

624
00:42:44,055 --> 00:42:47,973
and said he thinks he
can still salvage
his relationship with
President Trump,

625
00:42:47,973 --> 00:42:53,019
which is like
Justin Baldoni saying,
"I'd love to work
with Blake again."

626
00:42:53,773 --> 00:42:59,215
President Trump posted
an AI-generated video featuring
a transformed Gaza

627
00:42:59,215 --> 00:43:02,672
with a Trump Hotel,
bearded belly dancers,

628
00:43:02,672 --> 00:43:05,595
and
Benjamin Netanyahu
lounging on a beach.

629
00:43:05,595 --> 00:43:08,874
The video was titled
"ISIS Recruitment Ad."

630
00:43:08,874 --> 00:43:13,668
Attorney General Pam Bondi
sent a letter to FBI
Director Kash Patel,

631
00:43:13,668 --> 00:43:17,428
saying that she learned
from a source
that the New York FBI office

632
00:43:17,428 --> 00:43:20,751
has
thousands of Epstein files
that it still hasn't released.

633
00:43:20,751 --> 00:43:25,443
Kash Patel is currently
looking for those files
in two different directions.

634
00:43:28,717 --> 00:43:33,948
Elon Musk, seen here letting
ketamine take the wheel...

635
00:43:35,008 --> 00:43:39,480
...sent an e-mail
to federal employees
telling them to list five things

636
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:41,718
they did last week
or they would be fired...

637
00:43:41,718 --> 00:43:45,179
which was easier for Elon to do
because all five of his

638
00:43:45,179 --> 00:43:47,408
were "got a lady pregnant."

639
00:43:50,632 --> 00:43:55,746
It was reported
that internal television
monitors at the offices
of Housing and Urban Development

640
00:43:55,746 --> 00:44:01,024
showed an AI-generated video
of President Trump
kissing the toes of Elon Musk.

641
00:44:01,024 --> 00:44:06,387
You can tell the video is AI
because in it,
Trump is able to bend.

642
00:44:07,159 --> 00:44:10,746
Ron DeSantis is pushing
for his wife, Casey,

643
00:44:10,746 --> 00:44:13,133
to succeed him
as governor of Florida.

644
00:44:13,133 --> 00:44:17,240
But I don't know.
Those are some pretty
gay boots to fill.

645
00:44:20,990 --> 00:44:25,125
Dozens of dead birds
believed to have died
from avian flu

646
00:44:25,125 --> 00:44:27,421
have washed up
on a Long Island beach.

647
00:44:27,421 --> 00:44:32,051
But don't worry--
RFK is almost done eating them.

648
00:44:33,073 --> 00:44:36,507
Former New York governor
Andrew Cuomo

649
00:44:36,507 --> 00:44:39,278
has decided to run for mayor
of New York City.

650
00:44:39,278 --> 00:44:44,144
Cuomo plans
to use his old campaign slogan
of "honk-a, honk-a."

651
00:44:48,226 --> 00:44:52,534
The Oscar campaign
for Best Picture nominee
"Emilia Pérez"

652
00:44:52,534 --> 00:44:57,168
was badly damaged
after problematic old tweets
about George Floyd

653
00:44:57,168 --> 00:45:01,152
surfaced from transgender star
Karla Sofía Gascón.

654
00:45:01,152 --> 00:45:03,195
And I think we
can all agree--

655
00:45:03,195 --> 00:45:04,801
What?

656
00:45:09,047 --> 00:45:14,463
Last week, a U.S.
appeals court blocked
a Biden-era student debt
relief plan,

657
00:45:14,463 --> 00:45:18,258
which means the only way
for young people to pay off
their student loans

658
00:45:18,258 --> 00:45:21,198
is by dating Bill Belichick.

659
00:45:25,939 --> 00:45:30,797
This week,
MSNBC fired its only non-white
prime-time host,

660
00:45:30,797 --> 00:45:35,368
and Lester Holt announced
he is stepping down
as the anchor of
"NBC Nightly News."

661
00:45:35,368 --> 00:45:38,867
Well, NBC...
only one more to go, baby.

662
00:45:44,110 --> 00:45:46,142
Wait a minute. Are you guys
rooting for me to leave?

663
00:45:46,142 --> 00:45:49,226
Yeah, sure. "Whoo!"

664
00:45:50,083 --> 00:45:53,686
Well, guys,
the Oscars are tomorrow night.
Here with his prediction

665
00:45:53,687 --> 00:45:56,488
for Best Picture
is The Movie Guy.

666
00:45:56,489 --> 00:45:59,091
{\an8}Hey!

667
00:45:59,092 --> 00:46:00,359
{\an8}How's everybody doing tonight?

668
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:04,730
I'm The Movie Guy, and I'm here
to talk about which movie

669
00:46:04,731 --> 00:46:09,535
is going to win Best Picture.
'Cause right now, it's
a very tight race.

670
00:46:09,536 --> 00:46:12,604
That's right.
I've heard that.
So who are your top contenders?

671
00:46:12,605 --> 00:46:16,775
Well, let's start
with "Anora."
The only problem with "Anora"

672
00:46:16,776 --> 00:46:21,313
is, I wish she had a "more-a"
the boobies
and a less of the talking.

673
00:46:21,314 --> 00:46:26,452
[ Laughter ]
Okay. All right, Movie Guy.
Sure.

674
00:46:26,453 --> 00:46:31,890
No, no, I'm just kidding.
With full disclosure,
I didn't see that one.

675
00:46:31,891 --> 00:46:37,129
But I would like to talk about
"A Complete Unknown."
This movie is a complete unknown

676
00:46:37,130 --> 00:46:41,500
to me because I didn't see
this one, as well.
[ Laughter ]

677
00:46:41,501 --> 00:46:45,070
Right. Okay.
I guess I'm starting
to wonder why you're here.

678
00:46:45,071 --> 00:46:48,474
Because I'm The Movie Guy.
[ Laughter ]
Okay.

679
00:46:48,475 --> 00:46:53,078
Listen, listen, man,
I know that Timothée Chalamet do
a perfect "imperfatation"

680
00:46:53,079 --> 00:46:57,082
of Bob Dylan.
But you know who my favorite
Bob?

681
00:46:57,083 --> 00:47:02,888
"PlumbBob."
I'm sorry. Who?
"PlumbBob"!

682
00:47:02,889 --> 00:47:07,459
[ Laughter ]
"PlumbBob" SquarePants.
What?

683
00:47:07,460 --> 00:47:13,365
You know him.
His best friend is a "tar."
He's in love with a "quirrel."

684
00:47:13,366 --> 00:47:16,635
One episode,
he learning to drive a car,
and then the next episode

685
00:47:16,636 --> 00:47:21,206
he delivering pizza,
and then the next episode,
he ripping his pants.

686
00:47:21,207 --> 00:47:25,944
The only way
to describe the plot
of "PlumbBob" is unlimited.

687
00:47:25,945 --> 00:47:31,517
[ Laughter ]
You know [Laughs]
You know, you...

688
00:47:31,518 --> 00:47:35,187
You call yourself The Movie Guy,
but it seems
like you're more interested

689
00:47:35,188 --> 00:47:40,426
in talking about SpongeBob.
You're right. [ Laughs ]
You're right, man.

690
00:47:40,427 --> 00:47:44,063
Let's talk about movies, okay?
Let's talk about "Conclave."
Yeah.

691
00:47:44,064 --> 00:47:50,502
Yeah, this movie has to be
about the Pope, right?
[ Laughter ]

692
00:47:50,503 --> 00:47:53,572
Yes, yes,
it's about the Pope.
Yes, it's about the Pope.

693
00:47:53,573 --> 00:47:57,242
That's what I said.
[ Laughter ]
The [Laughs]

694
00:47:57,243 --> 00:48:04,249
The only thing that's weird
is that I didn't see that one.
[ Laughter ]

695
00:48:04,250 --> 00:48:10,022
But the Pope made
me think of Popeyeh.
Who?

696
00:48:10,023 --> 00:48:15,494
Popeyeh! You know him.
He the little bald guy
that loves 'pinach.

697
00:48:15,495 --> 00:48:20,466
Am I right, guys?
[ Laughter ]
You are talking

"I'm Still Here."
Yeah.

"Did he leave?"

I guess I'm just confused as to

704
00:48:52,532 --> 00:48:55,768
how you became The Movie Guy.
And you know what?
There's a lot of people

705
00:48:55,769 --> 00:48:58,337
that are very confused
about a lot of that stuff that's
happened in your life, as well.

However, my ultimate pick

"The Brutalist." Right.

Please tell me
that you've watched this.

this movie, man.
I'm The Movie Guy.

710
00:49:15,622 --> 00:49:19,625
This movie is
about an architect.
That's actually right, yes.

711
00:49:19,626 --> 00:49:22,227
Yeah.
And he escape
a concentration camp.

712
00:49:22,228 --> 00:49:24,596
And then
he want to build something.
And you know what

713
00:49:24,597 --> 00:49:28,133
he build?
A pineapple
under the sea for "PlumbBob."

714
00:49:28,134 --> 00:49:33,339
Am I right, guys?
The Movie Guy, everyone.
It could be "Wicked."

It could be "Wicked."

A couple on a Qatar Airlines
flight was forced to sit next

after the woman next to them
passed away mid-flight.

But on the bright side,
at least she finally
stopped coughing.

Well, someone
up there really liked it.

Two people at a movie theater
in Washington State
watching
"Captain America:
Brave New World,"

01:05:42,475 --> 01:05:49,581
Michael?
You want me to say I miss it?
Of course I do.

985
01:05:49,582 --> 01:05:53,585
You want me to say I'm sad
because no one will ever be
able to please me the way

986
01:05:53,586 --> 01:05:59,758
I'm able to please myself?
I am. Do you think I like that
I have to take someone to dinner

987
01:05:59,759 --> 01:06:08,301
25 times to get a worse version
of what I could do on my own.
It shatters me every single day.

988
01:06:10,603 --> 01:06:13,539
I'm sorry, Dr. Bashar.
I wasn't trying

989
01:06:13,540 --> 01:06:18,677
to antagonize you.
You were a legend, man.
We called you Mr. DIY--

990
01:06:18,678 --> 01:06:20,880
Dong In Yourself.

991
01:06:22,582 --> 01:06:26,051
No, no, it's-- It's okay.
I lost myself

992
01:06:26,052 --> 01:06:30,055
there for a moment.
That was-- That was no way
for a doctor to behave.

993
01:06:30,056 --> 01:06:33,926
All right. Sorry.
Let's see what
you're here for today.

994
01:06:33,927 --> 01:06:42,067
You'd like to remove
your top two ribs?
Yes, please, sir.

995
01:06:42,068 --> 01:06:48,575
Nice.
Nice.
Nice, nice.

996
01:06:58,985 --> 01:07:03,822
My thanks to Tate McRae,
Mike Myers...

997
01:07:03,823 --> 01:07:08,427
[ Cheers and applause ]
...Lorne Michaels, the cast,
the crew.

998
01:07:08,428 --> 01:07:11,030
You guys have been so nice
to me.
I appreciate it so much.

999
01:07:11,031 --> 01:07:14,466
Thank you, guys.
