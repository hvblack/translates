1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,614
hi my name is holly

2
00:00:01,614 --> 00:00:03,477
and i run happy hands daycare

3
00:00:03,477 --> 00:00:05,868
the coronavirus shut down our daycare center

4
00:00:05,868 --> 00:00:08,189
people just didn't feel safe
sending their kids

5
00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:10,262
we were about to close our doors

6
00:00:10,262 --> 00:00:12,426
but then we had an idea

7
00:00:12,426 --> 00:00:15,741
we realized that there's probably so
many people stuck inside

8
00:00:15,741 --> 00:00:18,146
with family members that they just can't stand

9
00:00:18,185 --> 00:00:20,939
so we decided to reopen as a
daycare center

10
00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:22,865
for uncles

11
00:00:22,865 --> 00:00:25,068
hey uncle hank

12
00:00:25,068 --> 00:00:26,433
good to have you today

13
00:00:26,433 --> 00:00:29,083
i got a hemorrhoid like a monkey knuckle
all right

14
00:00:29,083 --> 00:00:32,387
when most people have an uncle
they never think they'll spend all day with them

15
00:00:32,387 --> 00:00:34,662
hey um
you guys think fire's beautiful right

16
00:00:34,662 --> 00:00:38,600
morning miss holly my mom told me to say
thank you for all the prayers for our iguana

17
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:41,527
once covet hit
that nightmare became a reality

18
00:00:41,527 --> 00:00:44,933
uncle
shane
hey good morning

19
00:00:45,526 --> 00:00:48,459
wow wow nice shirt

20
00:00:48,459 --> 00:00:50,942
what sound does a wolf make
wolves

21
00:00:50,942 --> 00:00:52,875
so we offer a solution

22
00:00:52,875 --> 00:00:55,845
we give uncles a place to go during the day

23
00:00:55,845 --> 00:00:58,642
each day starts with a morning meeting

24
00:00:58,642 --> 00:00:59,436
wait what

25
00:00:59,436 --> 00:01:02,462
we give all the uncles a
scratch-off ticket
with their schedules on it

26
00:01:02,462 --> 00:01:03,745
yoga

27
00:01:03,745 --> 00:01:06,088
god damn it [ __ ]

28
00:01:06,089 --> 00:01:09,635
then the uncles participate
in a variety of activities that suit
their skill set

29
00:01:09,635 --> 00:01:11,730
okay uncle tommy yeah

30
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:14,117
how old are these girls

31
00:01:14,117 --> 00:01:17,365
are any of them underage

32
00:01:17,769 --> 00:01:21,485
well you can do this

33
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:26,317
i know okay go ahead

34
00:01:26,317 --> 00:01:27,768
they're all beautiful angels

35
00:01:27,768 --> 00:01:31,734
right but are any of them underage

36
00:01:31,734 --> 00:01:36,607
i don't know
so i have to assume

37
00:01:36,607 --> 00:01:39,438
they're all they're all underage

38
00:01:39,438 --> 00:01:43,512
great jobs yes i'm so proud of you

39
00:01:43,512 --> 00:01:44,705
yes
i'm proud of myself

40
00:01:44,705 --> 00:01:48,706
remember guys as
developed as they may seem

41
00:01:48,706 --> 00:01:51,887
it doesn't mean they're 18.

42
00:01:51,887 --> 00:01:53,962
just my computer

43
00:01:53,962 --> 00:01:56,314
did you guys get this laptop

44
00:01:56,314 --> 00:01:58,286
this is conspiracy class

45
00:01:58,286 --> 00:02:02,177
yeah so basically the hunter biden video
from his laptop is fake

46
00:02:02,177 --> 00:02:06,144
but it's
actually him but they gave him a fake
giant boner

47
00:02:06,144 --> 00:02:08,598
dude italian

48
00:02:08,598 --> 00:02:11,176
he's saying italians
- oh it's valiant

49
00:02:11,176 --> 00:02:14,694
i actually have evidence that jimmy hoffa
was one of the pilots on one of the
planes

50
00:02:14,694 --> 00:02:15,519
my cousin told me

51
00:02:15,519 --> 00:02:16,534
what yeah

52
00:02:16,534 --> 00:02:20,145
we read the uncle some books to help debunk some of
their conspiracy theories

53
00:02:20,145 --> 00:02:24,096
but i don't trust the vaccines cried the
rabbit

54
00:02:24,096 --> 00:02:28,069
oh but you should rabbit they're safe
exclaimed farmer jim

55
00:02:28,069 --> 00:02:33,239
if you don't take the vaccine you won't
be able to play with your rabbit friends
anymore

56
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:36,276
yeah all right but what happens when the
vaccine turns him gay

57
00:02:36,276 --> 00:02:37,152
like what happened
with me

58
00:02:37,152 --> 00:02:40,502
well remember uncle tim that's a conspiracy

59
00:02:40,502 --> 00:02:44,006
yeah the vaccines don't make
the rabbits gay it makes them artistic

60
00:02:44,006 --> 00:02:46,292
like painting and [ __ ]
- on an uncle

61
00:02:46,292 --> 00:02:50,855
farmer's giving the rabbit the vaccine
so he can control his mind

62
00:02:50,855 --> 00:02:54,313
here at our daycare we have lady uncles
too

63
00:02:54,313 --> 00:02:58,239
with our lady uncles we give them a pack
of cigarettes a robe

64
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:00,702
and a window they can look at him
to keep an eye on things

65
00:03:00,702 --> 00:03:03,191
see these kids out here look at these
kids

66
00:03:03,191 --> 00:03:05,041
