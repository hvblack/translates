1
00:00:02,384 --> 00:00:04,414
PENTAGON

2
00:00:04,414 --> 00:00:06,926
>>> THANK YOU ALL FOR COMING.

3
00:00:11,969 --> 00:00:15,936
I AM DR. PAP AND THIS IS SPECIAL
AGENT FITZSIMMONS WITH THE FSA.

4
00:00:15,936 --> 00:00:18,810
>> YOU'RE ALL HERE BECAUSE
YOU'VE EXPERIENCED

5
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:22,055
A VERIFIED
ALIEN ABDUCTION.

6
00:00:22,055 --> 00:00:24,377
>> YEAH.

7
00:00:28,711 --> 00:00:30,537
YOU KNOW, IT WAS WILD.

8
00:00:30,537 --> 00:00:32,861
ONE SECOND, WE'RE THREE FRIENDS
ON A CAMPING TRIP,

9
00:00:32,861 --> 00:00:36,030
AND THE NEXT
WE'RE CITIZENS OF THE STARS.

10
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:39,044
>> AND, SIR, BEFORE WE BEGIN,
MAY I SAY SOMETHING?

11
00:00:39,044 --> 00:00:44,155
I'M JUST REALIZING THAT I WAS
WEARING THE SAME OUTFIT THE LAST
TIME I WAS HERE.

12
00:00:44,155 --> 00:00:48,016
I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW I DO
HAVE OTHER CLOTHES.

13
00:00:48,016 --> 00:00:49,180
>> NOTED.

14
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:52,375
NOW, HOW WERE YOU ALL BROUGHT ON
BOARD THE CRAFT?

15
00:00:52,375 --> 00:00:55,056
>> WELL, WE WERE HIT WITH THIS
WARM SOFT LIGHT,

16
00:00:55,056 --> 00:00:59,829
AND THEN WE
MATERIALIZED ON THE SPACESHIP
BETWEEN THESE TWO GLOWING BEAMS.

17
00:00:59,829 --> 00:01:01,533
>> AND OUR CLOTHES WERE GONE,

18
00:01:01,533 --> 00:01:05,864
BUT WE WERE WEARING THESE COMFY
ROBES MADE OF TRANSPARENT LIGHT.

19
00:01:05,864 --> 00:01:09,165
>> AND YOU, MS. RAFFERTY?

20
00:01:19,331 --> 00:01:21,839
>> LITTLE DIFFERENT FOR ME.

21
00:01:22,147 --> 00:01:25,959
I WAS BY THE LAKE TAKING A WHORE
BATH.

22
00:01:25,959 --> 00:01:28,920
IT'S WHEN YOU WASH THE PITS AND
BITS.

23
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:34,324
THEN OUT OF NOWHERE, I GET
SUCKED UP BY A GIANT VACUUM CLEANER HOSE,

24
00:01:35,651 --> 00:01:39,047
AND I LAND ON THE
SHIP, STILL PANTSLESS, MIND YOU,

25
00:01:39,047 --> 00:01:43,188
SO MY JOUSER AND MY DEUCER ARE ON FULL DISPLAY,

26
00:01:43,188 --> 00:01:47,250
AND I SEE MY
OLD BUDDIES THE GRAY ALIENS WITH
THE BIG DUMB EYES,

27
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:50,286
AND IT HITS
ME I'VE BEEN ON THIS SPACESHIP

28
00:01:50,286 --> 00:01:53,801
MORE TIMES THAN I'VE BEEN TO A
DENTIST.

29
00:01:54,247 --> 00:01:57,483
I SEE.
AND ONCE ABOARD THE SHIP,
WHAT HAPPENED.

30
00:01:57,483 --> 00:02:00,565
>> >> WELL, THE ALIENS TAUGHT US
A UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE.

31
00:02:00,565 --> 00:02:03,647
THE CLOSEST WE HAVE TO IT IS
LOVE.

32
00:02:03,647 --> 00:02:07,724
>> IT'S A SOOTHING BEAUTIFUL
SOUND.

33
00:02:07,724 --> 00:02:11,615
I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN DO IT
JUSTICE, BUT IT'S LIKE A --

34
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:20,687
I
DIDN'T DO IT JUSTICE I DON'T
THINK.

35
00:02:20,687 --> 00:02:23,507
>> ALL RIGHT.
NOW THIS GETS MY GUNK BECAUSE

36
00:02:23,507 --> 00:02:27,445
THESE TWO ARE GETTING ASRM LOVE TINGLES,

37
00:02:27,445 --> 00:02:33,274
MEANWHILE DOWN IN GEN
POP, THE GRAYS AND I ARE DOING
OUR USUAL DANCE.

38
00:02:33,274 --> 00:02:35,847
THEY'RE BATTING MY KNOCKERS,

39
00:02:35,847 --> 00:02:39,571
THEY'RE STARING DOWN THE BARREL
OF MY SOUTH MOUTH.

40
00:02:39,571 --> 00:02:43,637
BUT I DON'T KNOW THEIR HEART
WASN'T IN IT.

41
00:02:44,578 --> 00:02:48,819
I SAW ONE OF THEM DO THIS LIKE --

42
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:52,390
I'M GOOD.
YOU KNOW, YOU CAN HAVE MY TURN.

43
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:55,574
ANYWAY, THAT'S WHEN TODD HERE
SHOWED UP.

44
00:02:55,945 --> 00:02:58,440
>> TODD, YOU LEFT THE BEINGS
MADE OF LIGHT?

45
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:01,801
>> I DID, SIR.
I GOT LOST ON THE WAY TO THE
BATHROOM.

46
00:03:01,801 --> 00:03:04,825
>> AND HOW DID THEY REACT WHEN
YOU WALKED INTO THE ROOM?

47
00:03:04,825 --> 00:03:09,662
>> LIKE MIDDLE SCHOOLERS MEETING
TAYLOR SWIFT.
THEY JUST MOBBED US.

48
00:03:09,662 --> 00:03:13,116
>> I WONDER WHAT WAS THE CAUSE
OF THE EXCITEMENT.

49
00:03:13,116 --> 00:03:15,425
>> CAN I THROW OUT A THEORY?

50
00:03:15,425 --> 00:03:19,863
THESE THINGS, THEY'RE SMOOTH
DOWN THERE.

51
00:03:20,481 --> 00:03:24,100
THEY'RE LIKE A BROKEN DOORBELL,
YOU KNOW?

52
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:25,455
NO DONG.

53
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:32,014
AND YOU KNOW, I'M WEARING MY
SEE-THROUGH ROBE,

54
00:03:32,014 --> 00:03:37,087
SO WHEN THEY
SAW THAT I WAS PACKING A TROLL NOSE,

55
00:03:38,905 --> 00:03:42,753
MY TROLL NOSE, YOU KNOW,
THEY JUST WENT RIGHT FOR IT.

56
00:03:42,753 --> 00:03:46,880
>> YEAH.
MY GRUMPY AND MY DUMPY WERE OLD NEWS

57
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:50,558
THE MINUTE THEY SAW TODD'S
TROLL NOSE HANGING THERE.

58
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:55,868
>> I'VE NEVER HEARD THE TERM
TROLL NOSE BEFORE.

59
00:03:55,868 --> 00:04:00,529
>> YOU MUST BE HANGING OUT AT A
DIFFERENT BOWLING ALLY THAN WE
DO, SIR.

60
00:04:00,529 --> 00:04:04,398
>> I'LL ASK THAT WE ALL STOP
SAYING TROLL NOSE, PLEASE.

61
00:04:04,398 --> 00:04:07,505
>> DURING THIS OR FOREVER?

62
00:04:07,505 --> 00:04:09,661
>> DURING THIS.

63
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:13,602
NOW, WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN THE
OTHER AREA OF THE SHIP?

64
00:04:13,602 --> 00:04:17,939
>> OH, THEY SHOWED A SINGLE ATOM
OF SOMETHING CALLED INFINITEM

65
00:04:17,939 --> 00:04:20,709
WHICH CAN POWER THE EARTH FOR
THOUSANDS OF YEARS.

66
00:04:20,709 --> 00:04:23,578
>> YEAH.
CUT TO WHERE I AM.

67
00:04:23,578 --> 00:04:27,768
TODD'S JUNK HAS WHIPPED THE
GRAYS INTO A FRENZY.

68
00:04:27,768 --> 00:04:30,135
THEY GOT HIM STOOD UP LIKE --

69
00:04:30,135 --> 00:04:33,011
WELL, TODD, DO YOU MIND?

70
00:04:36,406 --> 00:04:40,851
SO THEY'RE TAKING TURNS CHECKING
UNDER THE HOOD.

71
00:04:43,983 --> 00:04:47,609
THEY'RE LIKE
THIS REACHING UP,

72
00:04:47,609 --> 00:04:51,226
THEY'RE KIND
OF -- THEY'RE FLICKING IT.

73
00:04:52,131 --> 00:04:58,459
THEY'RE LIKE -- THEY'RE BATTING
AROUND LIKE A CAT.

74
00:04:58,459 --> 00:05:03,654
THEY'RE -- YOU KNOW, THEY'RE
SNIFFING IT.

75
00:05:06,728 --> 00:05:11,383
ONE GUY, HE TRIED TO WEAR IT
LIKE A HAT.

76
00:05:12,153 --> 00:05:16,070
HE HAD IT DRAPED OVER HIS NOSE
LIKE A VIKING HELMET.

77
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:22,132
AND THEN, ONE OF THOSE LUNATICS
GRABBED ON TO THIS THING,

78
00:05:22,132 --> 00:05:24,276
TRIED
TO HOIST HIMSELF UP.

79
00:05:24,276 --> 00:05:27,615
I SAID, CAREFUL, BUDDY.
LAST TIME I PULLED ON ONE THAT HARD,

80
00:05:27,615 --> 00:05:31,631
COP CHANGED HIS MIND AND
DID WRITE ME A TICKET.

81
00:05:38,007 --> 00:05:42,958
>> AND JUST IN CASE YOU'RE
WONDERING, I DID NOT BECOME
AROUSED.

82
00:05:42,958 --> 00:05:46,475
ANY TIME I FELT LIKE I MIGHT, I
JUST LOOKED AT COLLEEN HERE,

83
00:05:46,475 --> 00:05:48,956
AND
IT TOOK CARE OF IT FOR ME.
YOU KNOW?

84
00:05:48,956 --> 00:05:53,264
>> I'VE KILLED MORE CHUBBIES
THAN DIABETES.

85
00:05:53,264 --> 00:05:56,544
>> AND HOW WERE YOU ALL SENT
HOME?

86
00:05:56,544 --> 00:05:59,359
>> I WENT BACK TO THE SMART ALIENS,

87
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:03,377
AND THEY TOUCHED OUR
HEADS TO THEIRS, AND WE WERE
BACK ON EARTH.

88
00:06:03,377 --> 00:06:05,506
>> YEAH.
AND THEY GAVE ME THIS.

89
00:06:05,506 --> 00:06:08,597
THEY WANTED US TO HAVE IT TO
MAKE OUR WORLD BETTER.

90
00:06:08,681 --> 00:06:11,469
>> I ALSO GOT A FAREWELL SOUVENIR

91
00:06:11,469 --> 00:06:16,769
COURTESY OF ONE OF MY
GRAY PALS WHO BITCH SLAPPED ME OUT OF AN OPEN HATCH,

92
00:06:16,769 --> 00:06:21,557
AND THEN I
FALL 30 FEET AND I LAND FACE
DOWN WITH MY WEAN HOLE AND MY BEAN HOLE

93
00:06:21,557 --> 00:06:24,577
POINTED RIGHT AT KIM'S
FACE.

94
00:06:24,667 --> 00:06:28,886
>> KIM WHO?
>> JONG UN.

95
00:06:28,886 --> 00:06:31,391
BASTARDS DROPPED ME IN NORTH
KOREA.

96
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:35,121
BUT, HEY, NOT THE WORST PLACE
I'VE BEEN ON ALL FOURS.

97
00:06:35,121 --> 00:06:36,555

98
00:06:36,643 --> 00:06:41,199

THANK YOU.

103
00:09:20,527 --> 00:09:25,801
IT'S GREAT TO BE BACK HOSTING
SNL.

104
00:09:27,897 --> 00:09:33,353
I'M HERE BECAUSE OF MY NEW
MOVIE, "THE FALL GUY" WITH EMILY
BLUNT!

105
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:40,829
SO DON'T WORRY.
I'M NOT GOING TO MAKE ANY JOKES
ABOUT KEN.

106
00:09:40,829 --> 00:09:43,506
BECAUSE IT'S NOT FUNNY.

107
00:09:43,506 --> 00:09:48,639
KEN AND I, WE HAD TO BREAK UP.

108
00:09:48,735 --> 00:09:53,292
WE WENT TOO DEEP.
AND IT'S OVER.

109
00:09:53,292 --> 00:09:56,272
SO I'M NOT GONNA TALK ABOUT IT.

110
00:09:56,867 --> 00:10:00,900
I ACTUALLY AM GONNA TALK ABOUT
IT A LITTLE BIT.

111
00:10:01,923 --> 00:10:04,202
I HAVE TO.

112

654
00:31:58,617 --> 00:31:59,650
BEAVIS AND BUTT-HEAD WHEN YOU

655
00:31:59,652 --> 00:32:00,884
WERE A TEENAGER?

656
00:32:00,886 --> 00:32:01,451
>> NO.

657
00:32:01,453 --> 00:32:03,553
I WAS PRETTY, SO I WAS GOING TO

658
00:32:03,555 --> 00:32:05,188
PARTIES AND HOOKING UP.

659
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:08,992
NOW, PROFESSOR, IF AI IS LEFT

660
00:32:08,994 --> 00:32:10,327
UNREGULATED, WHAT IS YOUR WORST

661
00:32:10,329 --> 00:32:11,128
CASE SCENARIO?

662
00:32:11,130 --> 00:32:17,834
>> WELL, IN SIMPLEST TERMS, IT

663
00:32:17,836 --> 00:32:19,536
BECOMES SO INTELLIGENT THAT IT

664
00:32:19,538 --> 00:32:20,237
DEEMS HUMANS UNNECESSARY AND

665
00:32:20,239 --> 00:32:20,704
KILLS US ALL.

666
00:32:20,706 --> 00:32:22,372
>> BUT IF HUMAN BEINGS CREATED

667
00:32:22,374 --> 00:32:24,841
THE AI, CAN'T WE JUST PROGRAM IT

668
00:32:24,843 --> 00:32:25,909
TO NOT DO THAT?

669
00:32:25,911 --> 00:32:26,977
>> WELL, IT DEPENDS.

670
00:32:26,979 --> 00:32:28,979
OH, MY GOD.

671
00:32:28,981 --> 00:32:30,647
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

672
00:32:30,649 --> 00:32:33,850
>> WHAT?

673
00:32:33,852 --> 00:32:36,386
I THINK THAT'S A VALID QUESTION.

674
00:32:36,388 --> 00:32:36,920
>> NO!

675
00:32:36,922 --> 00:32:38,055
NOW THERE'S A GENTLEMAN BEHIND

676
00:32:38,057 --> 00:32:40,891

677
00:32:40,893 --> 00:32:43,327

678
00:32:43,329 --> 00:32:44,761

681
00:32:49,268 --> 00:32:51,468

682
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:54,004
HE'S BEAVIS' FRIEND.

683
00:32:54,006 --> 00:32:55,405

AND DISCUSS AI, SO WOULD YOU

685
00:32:56,975 --> 00:32:57,974

686
00:32:57,976 --> 00:32:58,875

>> SHE'S TALKING TO YOU.

693
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:35,579
>> OH, I'M SORRY.

694

695
00:33:36,281 --> 00:33:40,517

>> THAT'S SOMETHING TROLLING.

704
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:09,012
THAT'S A REFERENCE TO THE

705

MICHAEL CHE.

829
00:41:09,551 --> 00:41:10,116
>>> THANK YOU.

830
00:41:10,118 --> 00:41:11,451
GOOD EVENING, EVERYONE.

831
00:41:11,453 --> 00:41:13,119
>> WELCOME TO "WEEKEND UPDATE."

832
00:41:13,121 --> 00:41:13,620
I'M MICHAEL CHE.

833
00:41:13,622 --> 00:41:17,223
>> I'M COLIN JOST.

834
00:41:17,225 --> 00:41:18,992
THE ARIZONA SUPREME COURT HAS

835
00:41:18,994 --> 00:41:21,427
REINSTATED A LAW FROM 1964

836
00:41:21,429 --> 00:41:23,963
BANNING DOCTORS FROM PERFORMING

837
00:41:23,965 --> 00:41:24,330
ABORTIONS.

838
00:41:24,332 --> 00:41:27,367
NOW, REINSTATING LAWS FROM 1864

839
00:41:27,369 --> 00:41:28,601
ISN'T THE WORST THING FOR ME

840
00:41:28,603 --> 00:41:31,704
BECAUSE I'M A WHITE LAND OWNER.

841
00:41:31,706 --> 00:41:34,140
AND A PROUD FREE MASON.

842
00:41:34,142 --> 00:41:36,109
BUT IT'S PROBABLY NOT GREAT TO

843
00:41:36,111 --> 00:41:37,544
ADOPT HEALTH CARE RULES FROM A

844
00:41:37,546 --> 00:41:39,546
TIME WHERE THE ONLY TWO THINGS

845
00:41:39,548 --> 00:41:41,848
DOCTORS PRESCRIBED WERE PRAYER

846
00:41:41,850 --> 00:41:42,248
AND COCAINE.

847
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:46,953
SATURDAY AND SUNDAY.

848
00:41:46,955 --> 00:41:48,655
BACK THEN, IF YOU DIDN'T WANT TO

849
00:41:48,657 --> 00:41:51,157
KEEP YOUR BABY, YOUR ONLY OPTION

850
00:41:51,159 --> 00:41:57,196
WAS TO GIVE IT TO RUMPLE STILL

851
00:41:57,198 --> 00:41:57,497
SKIN.

852
00:41:57,499 --> 00:41:58,498
PRESIDENT BIDEN CRITICIZED THE

853
00:41:58,500 --> 00:41:59,999
LAW CALLING IT CRUEL, WHICH IS

854
00:42:00,001 --> 00:42:01,568
THE SAME THING HE SAID WHEN HE

855
00:42:01,570 --> 00:42:03,970
VOTED AGAINST IT IN 1864.

856
00:42:03,972 --> 00:42:05,705
>> THIS WEEK, DONALD TRUMP SAID

857
00:42:05,707 --> 00:42:07,907
THAT HE SUPPORTS ABORTION LAWS

858
00:42:07,909 --> 00:42:10,076
BEING DECIDED BY THE STATES

859
00:42:10,078 --> 00:42:11,044
INSTEAD OF THE FEDERAL

860
00:42:11,046 --> 00:42:11,444
GOVERNMENT.

861
00:42:11,446 --> 00:42:12,879
BUT WHY STOP THERE?

862
00:42:12,881 --> 00:42:14,847
WHY NOT GO EVEN SMALLER AND

863
00:42:14,849 --> 00:42:17,016
LEAVE IT UP TO THE COUNTY OR THE

864
00:42:17,018 --> 00:42:18,217
CITY, OR EVEN BETTER, TAKE THE

865
00:42:18,219 --> 00:42:19,619
GOVERNMENT OUT OF IT COMPLETELY

866
00:42:19,621 --> 00:42:21,120
AND LEAVE THE CHOICE ABOUT WHAT

867
00:42:21,122 --> 00:42:22,855
WOMEN CAN DO WITH THEIR BODIES

868
00:42:22,857 --> 00:42:24,791
TO THE PERSON WHO KNOWS WHAT

869
00:42:24,793 --> 00:42:25,525
THEY CAN DO WITH THEM THE BEST,

870
00:42:25,527 --> 00:42:27,760
THEIR HUSBANDS.

871
00:42:33,201 --> 00:42:35,969
>> IN A VIDEO ON TRUTH SOCIAL,

872
00:42:35,971 --> 00:42:37,770
DONALD TRUMP FALSELY SAID THAT

873
00:42:37,772 --> 00:42:38,972
DEMOCRATS SUPPORT ABORTION UP TO

874
00:42:38,974 --> 00:42:40,974
THE NINTH MONTH AND BEYOND.

875
00:42:40,976 --> 00:42:42,275
SAYING, THE BABY IS EXECUTED

876
00:42:42,277 --> 00:42:45,111
AFTER BIRTH.

877
00:42:45,113 --> 00:42:47,347
BUT HE ONLY THINKS THAT HAPPENS

878
00:42:47,349 --> 00:42:49,449
BECAUSE WHEN TRUMP WAS A BABY, A

879
00:42:49,451 --> 00:42:50,917
BUNCH OF TIME TRAVELERS SHOWED

880
00:42:50,919 --> 00:42:54,020
UP TRYING TO KILL HIM.

881
00:42:54,022 --> 00:42:55,521
>> O.J. SIMPSON DIED THIS WEEK

882
00:42:55,523 --> 00:42:59,392
AT THE AGE OF 76 AFTER A BATTLE

883
00:42:59,394 --> 00:43:01,461
WITH PROSTATE CANCER THAT WAS

884
00:43:01,463 --> 00:43:02,462
PLANTED ON HIM BY THE LAPD.

885
00:43:06,635 --> 00:43:08,234
>> THERE WAS ACTUAL LISTEN AN

886
00:43:08,236 --> 00:43:10,803
ERROR IN THE LA TIMES OBITUARY

887
00:43:10,805 --> 00:43:12,472
FOR O.J. SIMPSON IN THE SECTION

888
00:43:12,474 --> 00:43:13,339
ABOUT HIS PRISON TIME.

889
00:43:13,341 --> 00:43:16,476
INSTEAD OF WRITING OJ WALKED OUT

890
00:43:16,478 --> 00:43:18,978
OF THE LOVE LAW CORRECTIONAL

891
00:43:18,980 --> 00:43:20,913
CENTER, THEY WROTE, TRUMP WALKED

892
00:43:20,915 --> 00:43:23,316
OUT OF THE LOVE LAW CORRECTIONAL

893
00:43:23,318 --> 00:43:25,618
CENTER A FREE MAN FOR THE FIRST

894
00:43:25,620 --> 00:43:26,486
TIME IN NINE YEARS.

895
00:43:26,488 --> 00:43:28,521
IT'S NOT A GREAT SIGN FOR TRUMP

896
00:43:28,523 --> 00:43:30,690
THAT EVEN AUTO CORRECT THINKS HE

897
00:43:30,692 --> 00:43:31,524
BELONGS IN JAIL.

898
00:43:31,526 --> 00:43:34,027
>> PRESIDENT BIDEN MET WITH

899
00:43:34,029 --> 00:43:35,128
JAPAN'S PRIME MINISTER WHERE

900
00:43:35,130 --> 00:43:37,163
THEY DISCUSSED BUILDING A NEW

901
00:43:37,165 --> 00:43:39,165
BULLET TRAIN SYSTEM IN AMERICA

902
00:43:39,167 --> 00:43:41,434
USING ADVANCED JAPANESE

903
00:43:41,436 --> 00:43:41,834
TECHNOLOGY.

904
00:43:41,836 --> 00:43:44,237
IN RETURN, JAPAN REQUESTED THE

905
00:43:44,239 --> 00:43:44,971
ADVANCED AMERICAN TECHNOLOGY OF

906
00:43:44,973 --> 00:43:46,739
FORKS.

907
00:43:51,379 --> 00:43:52,645
>> A NEW --

908
00:43:53,048 --> 00:43:54,080
A NEW REPORT FROM THE WHITE

909
00:43:54,082 --> 00:43:55,348
HOUSE CLAIMS THAT PRESIDENT

910
00:43:55,350 --> 00:43:57,483
BIDEN'S BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF

911
00:43:57,485 --> 00:44:00,486
STUDENT LOAN RELIEF WILL

912

WHICH HAS EARNED BIDEN THE

914
00:44:04,793 --> 00:44:08,461
NICKNAME EL PAPA DESUGAR.

915
00:44:08,463 --> 00:44:10,563
>> YESTERDAY, MIKE JOHNSON,

916
00:44:10,565 --> 00:44:12,598

IS IN JEOPARDY TRAVELED TO

918
00:44:15,203 --> 00:44:17,070
MAR-A-LAGO FOR A MEETING WITH

919
00:44:17,072 --> 00:44:17,937
DONALD TRUMP, AND BOY IS HIS JAW

00:44:17,939 --> 00:44:18,237
TIRED.

921
00:44:18,239 --> 00:44:22,408
ALL RIGHT.

922
00:44:26,081 --> 00:44:26,913
>> THAT GOT APPLAUSE?

923
00:44:26,915 --> 00:44:32,485
THAT EVENTUALLY GOT APPLAUSE?

924
00:44:32,487 --> 00:44:35,655
SENATOR MITCH McCONNELL SEEN

925
00:44:35,657 --> 00:44:37,190
HERE BEING TOLD A BLACK WOMAN

926
00:44:37,192 --> 00:44:42,795
MADE A COUNTRY ALBUM -- HAS --

927
00:44:42,797 --> 00:44:46,432
HAS COME OUT IN FAVOR OF A BILL

928
00:44:46,434 --> 00:44:47,200
THAT WOULD POTENTIALLY BAN TICK

929
00:44:47,202 --> 00:44:47,767
KNOCK IN THE U.S.

930
00:44:47,769 --> 00:44:49,602
OF COURSE, FOR McCONNELL, TIKTOK

931
00:44:49,604 --> 00:44:51,471
IS JUST WHAT THE GRIM REAPER

932
00:44:51,473 --> 00:44:54,607
SAYS WHILE TAPPING HIS WATCH.

933
00:44:54,609 --> 00:44:57,343
>> THIS WEEK, THE TERM

934
00:44:57,345 --> 00:45:00,847
WEAPONIZED INCOMPETENCE WAS

935
00:45:00,849 --> 00:45:02,648
TRENDING ON TIKTOK AS SOME WOMEN

936
00:45:02,650 --> 00:45:05,017
WERE CALLING OUT THEIR MALE

937
00:45:05,019 --> 00:45:07,720
PARTNERS FOR DOING SIMPLE TASKS

938
00:45:07,722 --> 00:45:09,255
BAD ON PURPOSE SO THEY NEVER

939
00:45:09,257 --> 00:45:11,090
HAVE TO DO IT AGAIN.

940
00:45:11,092 --> 00:45:13,092
HERE TO COMMENT IS OUR RESIDENT

941
00:45:13,094 --> 00:45:14,360
BOYFRIEND MICHAEL LONGFELLOW.

00:45:21,269 --> 00:45:21,868

WEAPONIZED INCOMPETENCE?

947
00:45:26,307 --> 00:45:28,674
>> WELL, I JUST LEARNED ABOUT IT

948
00:45:28,676 --> 00:45:30,476
BECAUSE MY GIRLFRIEND ASKED ME

949
00:45:30,478 --> 00:45:32,612
TO BUY DISHWASHER SOAP, AND I

950
00:45:32,614 --> 00:45:33,279
BOUGHT DISH SOAP, WHICH IS

951
00:45:33,281 --> 00:45:36,582
DIFFERENT I GUESS.

952
00:45:36,584 --> 00:45:39,552
SO MY TAKE IS I TOTALLY GET HER

POINT, BUT WHAT I NEED HER TO

954

UNDERSTAND IS I'M JUST

955
00:45:41,489 --> 00:45:43,456
INCOMPETENT.

956
00:45:43,458 --> 00:45:45,725
AND I'M TRYING REALLY, REALLY

957
00:45:45,727 --> 00:45:46,025
HARD.

958
00:45:46,027 --> 00:45:49,595
AND I LOVE YOU, GIRL.

959
00:45:49,597 --> 00:45:53,633
SO PLEASE, DON'T BE MAD AT ME.

960
00:45:53,635 --> 00:45:55,101
>> DO YOU THINK SHE MIGHT GET

961
00:45:55,103 --> 00:45:56,602
UPSET ABOUT YOU SAYING ANY OF

962
00:45:56,604 --> 00:45:57,537
THIS ON TV?

963
00:45:57,539 --> 00:45:58,171
>> NO.

964
00:45:58,173 --> 00:45:59,872
SHE'LL BE UPSET BECAUSE I WAS

965
00:45:59,874 --> 00:46:02,074
SUPPOSED TO PICK UP OUR CAT FROM

966
00:46:02,076 --> 00:46:04,110
DAY CARE YESTERDAY, AND I'M

967

REALIZING AS I SPEAK I TOTALLY

968
00:46:05,713 --> 00:46:06,045
FORGOT.

969
00:46:06,047 --> 00:46:08,047
>> MICHAEL, THAT'S NOT GREAT,

970
00:46:08,049 --> 00:46:08,347
MAN.

YOU KNOW WHAT?

976
00:46:16,257 --> 00:46:18,457
LET ME JUST TALK TO THE LADIES

977
00:46:18,459 --> 00:46:20,059
DIRECTLY FOR A SECOND.

978
00:46:20,061 --> 00:46:21,694
LET ME GET THE CAMERA.

979
00:46:21,696 --> 00:46:22,628
>> I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD,

980
00:46:22,630 --> 00:46:22,929
MAN.

981
00:46:22,931 --> 00:46:24,897
>> HEY, GIRLS.

982
00:46:24,899 --> 00:46:26,165
IT'S LONGFELLOW.

983
00:46:26,167 --> 00:46:26,666
DON'T GET EXCITED.

984
00:46:26,668 --> 00:46:29,735
IT'S JUST A NAME.

985
00:46:34,475 --> 00:46:36,008
SMALL WEINER JOKE.

986
00:46:36,010 --> 00:46:36,509
>> NO.

987
00:46:36,511 --> 00:46:37,510
WE GOT IT, MAN.

988
00:46:37,512 --> 00:46:38,044
WE GOT IT.

989
00:46:38,046 --> 00:46:39,445
>> JUST A JOKE.

990
00:46:39,447 --> 00:46:40,980
LOOK, LADIES, WHAT ARE WE

991
00:46:40,982 --> 00:46:42,582
FIGHTING ABOUT?

992
00:46:42,584 --> 00:46:46,352
THIS ISN'T US.

993
00:46:46,354 --> 00:46:48,087
YES, MEN SOMETIMES MESS UP TASKS

994
00:46:48,089 --> 00:46:50,823
SO SIMPLE THAT A CHILD COULD DO

995
00:46:50,825 --> 00:46:52,825
THEM, BUT, GIRL, THAT'S

996
00:46:52,827 --> 00:46:54,093
SOCIETY'S FAULT.

997
00:46:54,095 --> 00:46:55,828
THAT'S NOT US BEING WEAPONS.

998
00:46:55,830 --> 00:46:56,529
THE ONLY WEAPONS I OWN, RIGHT

999
00:46:56,531 --> 00:46:58,931
HERE.

1000

SICK IF POSSIBLE.

1004
00:47:06,441 --> 00:47:09,475
>> THAT'S YOUR POINT?

1005
00:47:09,477 --> 00:47:12,478
>> I FORGOT TO THINK OF ONE.

1006
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:14,447
I KNOW I NEED TO BE BETTER, BUT

1007
00:47:14,449 --> 00:47:16,415
HERE'S THE TRUTH.

1008
00:47:16,417 --> 00:47:17,650
IF I LIVED ALONE, I WOULD HAVE

1009
00:47:17,652 --> 00:47:19,552
ONE PLATE, I WOULD NEVER COOK, I

1010
00:47:19,554 --> 00:47:21,320

1011

TAKEOUT BOXES ON TOP OF THE

1012

TRASH CAN, AND WHEN THE BOXES

1013
00:47:25,860 --> 00:47:27,660
TOUCH THE CEILING, MOVE BACK IN

1014
00:47:27,662 --> 00:47:28,427
WITH MY MOM.

1015
00:47:28,429 --> 00:47:29,762
THAT'S A GOOD LIFE TO ME.

1016
00:47:29,764 --> 00:47:31,364
I'M OKAY LIVING LIKE THAT.

1017
00:47:31,366 --> 00:47:35,334
YOU'RE NOT, KATE.

1018
00:47:35,336 --> 00:47:37,270

1019
00:47:37,272 --> 00:47:38,371
GIRLFRIEND'S REAL NAME?

1020
00:47:38,373 --> 00:47:41,173

LET'S TURN THE TABLES.

1023
00:47:42,710 --> 00:47:44,744
LET'S TALK ABOUT WEAPONIZED

1024
00:47:44,746 --> 00:47:45,144
COMPETENCE.

1025
00:47:45,146 --> 00:47:45,945
>> WEAPONIZED COMPETENCE?

1026
00:47:45,947 --> 00:47:46,279
>> YEAH.

1027
00:47:46,281 --> 00:47:51,017
WOMEN.

1028
00:47:51,019 --> 00:47:52,251
YOU'RE TOO COMPETENT.

1029
00:47:52,253 --> 00:47:53,953
WHY DO YOU KNOW HOW TO DO ALL

1030
00:47:53,955 --> 00:47:54,620
THIS STUFF?

1031

HOW DO YOU KNOW THE WORD DUVET?

WHO TOLD YOU THAT?

1033
00:47:58,693 --> 00:48:01,027
I'VE BEEN LIVING ON THE SAME

EARTH AS YOU, GIRL.

1035
00:48:02,597 --> 00:48:04,830
NEVER ONCE HEARD DUVET.

1036
00:48:04,832 --> 00:48:06,332
NOW YOU'RE MAD AT ME BECAUSE I

1037
00:48:06,334 --> 00:48:08,267
DON'T KNOW HOW TO PUT IT ON?

1038
00:48:08,269 --> 00:48:10,102
PUT WHAT ON WHAT?

1039
00:48:10,104 --> 00:48:13,472

THESE ARE THE GIRLS THAT KICKED

1198
00:53:47,808 --> 00:53:50,142

00:54:07,662 --> 00:54:08,060
GIRLFRIEND.

1208
00:54:08,062 --> 00:54:08,827

1213
00:54:40,994 --> 00:54:46,331

1214
00:54:46,333 --> 00:54:47,299
SURGERY FOR 12 HOURS.

1215
00:54:47,301 --> 00:54:48,000
>> THANK YOU ALL FOR WAITING.

1216
00:54:48,002 --> 00:54:49,601
THE DOCTOR WILL SEE YOU NOW.

1217
00:54:49,603 --> 00:54:54,306
>> HELLO, FAMILY.

1218
00:54:54,308 --> 00:54:56,775
WELL, THIS IS NEVER EASY TO SAY.

1219
00:54:56,777 --> 00:54:58,510
WE DID EVERYTHING WE COULD, BUT

1220
00:54:58,512 --> 00:55:00,112
HE DID NOT MAKE IT.

1221
00:55:00,114 --> 00:55:01,180
>> OH, MY GOD.

1222
00:55:01,182 --> 00:55:02,781
>> IT'S OKAY, GUYS.

1223
00:55:02,783 --> 00:55:04,149
HE LIVED A LONG LIFE.

1224
00:55:04,151 --> 00:55:05,350
>> IF IT'S ANY COMFORT, IT'S NOT

1225
00:55:05,352 --> 00:55:09,054
MY FAULT.

1226
00:55:09,056 --> 00:55:09,922
>> OKAY.

1227
00:55:09,924 --> 00:55:10,222
YEAH.

1228
00:55:10,224 --> 00:55:12,391
WE DIDN'T THINK IT WAS ANYONE'S

1229
00:55:12,393 --> 00:55:12,691
FAULT.

1230
00:55:12,693 --> 00:55:14,727
>> MM, SO WE AGREE.

1231
00:55:14,729 --> 00:55:16,228
IT'S NOT MY FAULT.

1232
00:55:16,230 --> 00:55:17,830
COULD EACH OF YOU SAY THAT ONE

1233
00:55:17,832 --> 00:55:19,264
AT A TIME, PLEASE?

1234
00:55:19,266 --> 00:55:20,999
>> DO NOT RECORD US RIGHT NOW.

1235
00:55:21,001 --> 00:55:22,701
>> DOCTOR, CAN WE PLEASE HAVE A

1236
00:55:22,703 --> 00:55:23,302
MOMENT TO PROCESS THIS?

1237
00:55:23,304 --> 00:55:27,940
>> OKAY.

1238
00:55:27,942 --> 00:55:30,209
>> WELL, MAYBE WE SHOULD ALL GO

1239
00:55:30,211 --> 00:55:32,344
AROUND AND SAY SOMETHING WE

1240
00:55:32,346 --> 00:55:33,579
LOVED ABOUT GRANDPA.

1241
00:55:33,581 --> 00:55:35,681
>> I THINK THAT WOULD BE NICE.

1242
00:55:35,683 --> 00:55:37,149
>> I LOVE THE WAY THAT HE

1243
00:55:37,151 --> 00:55:37,516
SMELLED.

1244
00:55:37,518 --> 00:55:39,918
>> HELLO, AGAIN.

1245
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:41,854
THIS IS MY ASSOCIATE.

1246
00:55:41,856 --> 00:55:42,755
HE WAS IN THE OPERATING ROOM

1247
00:55:42,757 --> 00:55:43,489
WITH ME.

1248
00:55:43,491 --> 00:55:45,324
HE HAS SOMETHING HE WANTS TO

1249
00:55:45,326 --> 00:55:45,724
TELL YOU.

1250
00:55:45,726 --> 00:55:46,859
>> I'M SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS.

1251
00:55:46,861 --> 00:55:49,962
>> AND?

1252
00:55:49,964 --> 00:55:50,863
>> I DIDN'T DROP ANYTHING IN

1253
00:55:50,865 --> 00:55:54,767
ANYTHING.

1254
00:55:54,769 --> 00:55:56,435
>> SEE, NOW THAT MAKES IT SEEM

1255
00:55:56,437 --> 00:55:57,069
LIKE YOU DID.

1256
00:55:57,071 --> 00:55:59,138
>> NO, I DIDN'T.

1257
00:55:59,140 --> 00:56:01,774
HE WAS VERY OLD, VERY SICK, AND

1258
00:56:01,776 --> 00:56:04,109
THERE WAS ALREADY AN AIRPOD

1259
00:56:04,111 --> 00:56:04,676
INSIDE OF HIM.

1260
00:56:04,678 --> 00:56:05,511
>> OKAY.

1261
00:56:05,513 --> 00:56:07,279
YOU KNOW WHAT, MAYBE WE SHOULD

1262
00:56:07,281 --> 00:56:08,747
GET OUT OF THIS WAITING ROOM.

1263
00:56:08,749 --> 00:56:09,281
>> YEAH.

1264
00:56:09,283 --> 00:56:12,518
COME ON, KIDS, LET'S GO TO THE

1265
00:56:12,520 --> 00:56:12,918
CAFETERIA.

1266
00:56:12,920 --> 00:56:13,986
>> OH, ARE YOU HUNGRY?

1267
00:56:13,988 --> 00:56:15,788
WOULD YOU LIKE TO TRY SOME

1268
00:56:15,790 --> 00:56:16,955
COOKIE CRUMBLES?

1269
00:56:16,957 --> 00:56:19,992
>> WHAT ARE COOKIE CRUMBLES?

1270
00:56:19,994 --> 00:56:21,293
>> THEY'RE MY OWN CREATION.

1271
00:56:21,295 --> 00:56:23,061
SOMETIMES YOU DON'T WANT A WHOLE

1272
00:56:23,063 --> 00:56:25,597
COOKIE, YOU JUST WANT A BITE.

1273
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:26,665
>> DID YOU HAVE THAT ON YOU

1274
00:56:26,667 --> 00:56:27,766
DURING THE SURGERY?

1275
00:56:27,768 --> 00:56:30,936
>> WE HAD A FEW SPOONFULS, YES.

1276
00:56:30,938 --> 00:56:33,338
THAT'S HOW YOU EAT THEM, WITH A

1277
00:56:33,340 --> 00:56:34,072
LITTLE RED SPOON.

1278
00:56:34,074 --> 00:56:35,841
IT WOULD COME WITH IT.

1279
00:56:35,843 --> 00:56:36,508
>> UM, ARE YOU LIKE SELLING

1280
00:56:36,510 --> 00:56:38,877
THESE?

1281
00:56:38,879 --> 00:56:39,912
>> THE COOKIE CRUMBLES OR THE

1282
00:56:39,914 --> 00:56:42,815
SPOON?

1283
00:56:42,817 --> 00:56:46,885
EITHER WAY, NOT YET BUT SOON.

1284
00:56:46,887 --> 00:56:49,922
>> SO, IT'S JUST CRUMBS OF

1285
00:56:49,924 --> 00:56:50,255
COOKIES?

1286
00:56:50,257 --> 00:56:52,291
>> IT'S COOKIE CRUMBLES.

1287
00:56:52,293 --> 00:56:54,259
WHAT DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND?

1288
00:56:54,261 --> 00:56:56,395
FOR WHEN YOU WANT A COOKIE, BUT

1289
00:56:56,397 --> 00:56:57,429
YOU DON'T WANT THE WHOLE THING.

1290
00:56:57,431 --> 00:57:01,066
I DIDN'T KILL HIM.

1291
00:57:01,068 --> 00:57:03,502
>> THE SLOGAN IS THAT'S THE WAY

1292
00:57:03,504 --> 00:57:04,503
THE COOKIE FALLS APART INTO

1293
00:57:04,505 --> 00:57:06,972
LITTLE PIECES.

1294
00:57:06,974 --> 00:57:08,674
>> WHY NOT JUST THAT'S THE WAY

1295
00:57:08,676 --> 00:57:10,209
THE COOKIE CRUMBLES?

1296
00:57:10,211 --> 00:57:13,345
>> WE'RE NOT TAKING ANY PITCHES.

1297
00:57:13,347 --> 00:57:15,280
>> DOCTOR, PLEASE --

1298
00:57:15,282 --> 00:57:17,716
>> HOW DID YOU KNOW MY LAST

1299
00:57:17,718 --> 00:57:18,016
NAME?

1300
00:57:18,018 --> 00:57:19,484
>> YOUR LAST NAME IS PLEASE?

1301
00:57:19,486 --> 00:57:20,385
>> YES.

1302
00:57:20,387 --> 00:57:21,119
HE'S DR. PLEASE, AND I'M JEFFREY

1303
00:57:21,121 --> 00:57:24,857
THANK YOU.

1304
00:57:24,859 --> 00:57:25,257
>> LOOK.

1305
00:57:25,259 --> 00:57:27,092
WE'RE TRYING TO GRIEVE.

1306
00:57:27,094 --> 00:57:27,926
MY FATHER IS GONE.

1307
00:57:27,928 --> 00:57:30,829
>> WE CAN'T BRING HIM BACK.

1308
00:57:30,831 --> 00:57:35,634
>> YEAH.

1309
00:57:35,636 --> 00:57:36,401
WE KNOW THAT OBVIOUSLY.

1310
00:57:36,403 --> 00:57:37,569
>> UNLESS YOU THINK MAYBE WE

1311
00:57:37,571 --> 00:57:38,337
COULD.

1312
00:57:38,339 --> 00:57:38,604
NO.

1313
00:57:38,606 --> 00:57:41,039
>> IT'S NOT SOMETHING WE CAN DO,

1314
00:57:41,041 --> 00:57:41,773
UNLESS YOU THINK WE SHOULD TRY.

1315
00:57:41,775 --> 00:57:44,376
>> NO.

1316
00:57:44,378 --> 00:57:46,178
>> LOOK, WE NEED TO MAKE A FEW

1317
00:57:46,180 --> 00:57:47,846
CALLS AND ARRANGEMENTS.

1318
00:57:47,848 --> 00:57:48,614
CAN WE PLEASE HAVE SOME PRIVACY?

1319
00:57:48,616 --> 00:57:52,217
>> OKAY.

1320
00:57:52,219 --> 00:57:53,018
>> OKAY.

1321
00:57:53,020 --> 00:57:54,887
WHAT IS UP WITH THESE GUYS?

1322
00:57:54,889 --> 00:57:56,288
I'M KIND OF CREEPED OUT.

1323
00:57:56,290 --> 00:57:57,890
>> DO THEY EVEN WORK HERE?

1324
00:57:57,892 --> 00:57:59,024
>> I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU GUYS,

01:06:12,586 --> 01:06:13,218
>> YEAH.

1494
01:06:13,220 --> 01:06:15,186
YOU COULDN'T HANDLE MY LIFE,

1495
01:06:15,188 --> 01:06:15,520
GEORGE.

1496
01:06:15,522 --> 01:06:16,488
TRUST ME.

1497
01:06:16,490 --> 01:06:17,222
WE'RE BETTER OFF BEING FRIENDS.

1498
01:06:17,224 --> 01:06:19,324
>> FRIENDS?

1499
01:06:19,326 --> 01:06:21,893
YOU SAY FRIENDS?

1500
01:06:21,895 --> 01:06:29,701
WELL, I KNOW SOME FRIENDS.

1501
01:06:29,703 --> 01:06:34,439
CHANDLER, RACHEL, JOEY, ROSS,

1502
01:06:34,441 --> 01:06:35,440
MONICA, PHOEBE, AND CENTRAL

1503
01:06:35,442 --> 01:06:38,009
PERK.

1504
01:06:38,011 --> 01:06:44,282
NOT A PERSON, BUT UNDENIABLY A

1505
01:06:44,284 --> 01:06:45,450
CHARACTER IN THAT SHOW.

1506
01:06:45,452 --> 01:06:46,684
>> WILL Y'ALL PLEASE SHUT UP?

1507
01:06:46,686 --> 01:06:48,386
I LIVE ACROSS THE STREET AND I

1508
01:06:48,388 --> 01:06:49,854
CAN'T GET A WINK OF SLEEP.

1509
01:06:49,856 --> 01:06:51,189
>> SORRY ABOUT THAT.

1510
01:06:51,191 --> 01:06:53,725
WE DIDN'T MEAN TO MAKE SO MUCH

1511
01:06:53,727 --> 01:06:54,058
NOISE.

1512
01:06:54,060 --> 01:06:54,426
>> NOISE?

1513
01:06:54,428 --> 01:06:54,959
DID YOU SAY NOISE?

1514
01:06:54,961 --> 01:07:00,098
I KNOW A COUPLE NOISES.

1515
01:07:00,100 --> 01:07:02,200
BEEP BEEP, THAT'S THE SOUND OF

1516
01:07:02,202 --> 01:07:04,736
MY EX-WIFE'S CAR PARKED OUTSIDE

1517
01:07:04,738 --> 01:07:07,572
MY HOUSE.

1518
01:07:07,574 --> 01:07:08,573
HA-HA-HA, THAT'S THE SOUND OF

1519
01:07:08,575 --> 01:07:09,941
CHILDREN LAUGHING AT ME WHEN I

1520
01:07:09,943 --> 01:07:14,679
TRY TO LEARN HOW TO SKATEBOARD.

1521
01:07:14,681 --> 01:07:16,815
WEE, WEE, WEE, THAT'S THE SOUND

1522
01:07:16,817 --> 01:07:20,718
OF BATS FLYING AROUND MY ATTIC.

1523
01:07:20,720 --> 01:07:21,453
POW!

1524
01:07:21,455 --> 01:07:23,621
THAT'S ME DOING KARATE ON THE

1525
01:07:23,623 --> 01:07:23,922
BATS.

1526
01:07:23,924 --> 01:07:26,057
HOW'S THAT FOR SOUND?

1527
01:07:26,059 --> 01:07:28,393
>> IT'S GOOD.

1528
01:07:28,395 --> 01:07:31,329
IT'S REALLY GOOD.

1529
01:07:31,331 --> 01:07:34,199
>> BUT YOU'VE CONVINCED ME I'D

1530
01:07:34,201 --> 01:07:34,933
LOVE TO GET THAT DINNER.

1531
01:07:34,935 --> 01:07:37,101
>> GREAT.

1532
01:07:37,103 --> 01:07:37,702
CAN I HAVE YOUR NUMBER?

1533
01:07:37,704 --> 01:07:39,003
>> NUMBER?

1534
01:07:39,005 --> 01:07:39,337
>> OH.

1535
01:07:39,339 --> 01:07:41,072
>> NO.

1536
01:07:41,074 --> 01:07:45,610
WE ARE NOT DOING THIS AGAIN.

1537
01:08:22,915 --> 01:08:33,691
McKINNON!

1538
01:08:33,693 --> 01:08:39,564
EMILY BLUNT, AND CAITLIN CLARK!

1539
01:08:39,566 --> 01:08:40,064
EVA, I LOVE YOU.

1540
01:08:40,066 --> 01:08:43,968
THE BEST CREW IN THE WORLD.

1541
01:08:43,970 --> 01:08:44,535
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

1542
01:08:44,537 --> 01:08:45,536
