1
00:00:02,384 --> 00:00:04,414
PENTAGON

2
00:00:04,414 --> 00:00:06,926
>>> THANK YOU ALL FOR COMING.

3
00:00:11,969 --> 00:00:15,936
I AM DR. PAP AND THIS IS SPECIAL
AGENT FITZSIMMONS WITH THE FSA.

4
00:00:15,936 --> 00:00:18,810
>> YOU'RE ALL HERE BECAUSE
YOU'VE EXPERIENCED

5
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:22,055
A VERIFIED
ALIEN ABDUCTION.

6
00:00:22,055 --> 00:00:24,377
>> YEAH.

7
00:00:28,711 --> 00:00:30,537
YOU KNOW, IT WAS WILD.

8
00:00:30,537 --> 00:00:32,861
ONE SECOND, WE'RE THREE FRIENDS
ON A CAMPING TRIP,

9
00:00:32,861 --> 00:00:36,030
AND THE NEXT
WE'RE CITIZENS OF THE STARS.

10
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:39,044
>> AND, SIR, BEFORE WE BEGIN,
MAY I SAY SOMETHING?

11
00:00:39,044 --> 00:00:44,155
I'M JUST REALIZING THAT I WAS
WEARING THE SAME OUTFIT THE LAST
TIME I WAS HERE.

12
00:00:44,155 --> 00:00:48,016
I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW I DO
HAVE OTHER CLOTHES.

13
00:00:48,016 --> 00:00:49,180
>> NOTED.

14
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:52,375
NOW, HOW WERE YOU ALL BROUGHT ON
BOARD THE CRAFT?

15
00:00:52,375 --> 00:00:55,056
>> WELL, WE WERE HIT WITH THIS
WARM SOFT LIGHT,

16
00:00:55,056 --> 00:00:59,829
AND THEN WE
MATERIALIZED ON THE SPACESHIP
BETWEEN THESE TWO GLOWING BEAMS.

17
00:00:59,829 --> 00:01:01,533
>> AND OUR CLOTHES WERE GONE,

18
00:01:01,533 --> 00:01:05,864
BUT WE WERE WEARING THESE COMFY
ROBES MADE OF TRANSPARENT LIGHT.

19
00:01:05,864 --> 00:01:09,165
>> AND YOU, MS. RAFFERTY?

20
00:01:19,331 --> 00:01:21,839
>> LITTLE DIFFERENT FOR ME.

21
00:01:22,147 --> 00:01:25,959
I WAS BY THE LAKE TAKING A WHORE
BATH.

22
00:01:25,959 --> 00:01:28,920
IT'S WHEN YOU WASH THE PITS AND
BITS.

23
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:34,324
THEN OUT OF NOWHERE, I GET
SUCKED UP BY A GIANT VACUUM CLEANER HOSE,

24
00:01:35,651 --> 00:01:39,047
AND I LAND ON THE
SHIP, STILL PANTSLESS, MIND YOU,

25
00:01:39,047 --> 00:01:43,188
SO MY JOUSER AND MY DEUCER ARE ON FULL DISPLAY,

26
00:01:43,188 --> 00:01:47,250
AND I SEE MY
OLD BUDDIES THE GRAY ALIENS WITH
THE BIG DUMB EYES,

27
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:50,286
AND IT HITS
ME I'VE BEEN ON THIS SPACESHIP

28
00:01:50,286 --> 00:01:53,801
MORE TIMES THAN I'VE BEEN TO A
DENTIST.

29
00:01:54,247 --> 00:01:57,483
I SEE.
AND ONCE ABOARD THE SHIP,
WHAT HAPPENED.

30
00:01:57,483 --> 00:02:00,565
>> >> WELL, THE ALIENS TAUGHT US
A UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE.

31
00:02:00,565 --> 00:02:03,647
THE CLOSEST WE HAVE TO IT IS
LOVE.

32
00:02:03,647 --> 00:02:07,724
>> IT'S A SOOTHING BEAUTIFUL
SOUND.

33
00:02:07,724 --> 00:02:11,615
I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN DO IT
JUSTICE, BUT IT'S LIKE A --

34
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:20,687
I
DIDN'T DO IT JUSTICE I DON'T
THINK.

35
00:02:20,687 --> 00:02:23,507
>> ALL RIGHT.
NOW THIS GETS MY GUNK BECAUSE

36
00:02:23,507 --> 00:02:27,445
THESE TWO ARE GETTING ASRM LOVE TINGLES,

37
00:02:27,445 --> 00:02:33,274
MEANWHILE DOWN IN GEN
POP, THE GRAYS AND I ARE DOING
OUR USUAL DANCE.

38
00:02:33,274 --> 00:02:35,847
THEY'RE BATTING MY KNOCKERS,

39
00:02:35,847 --> 00:02:39,571
THEY'RE STARING DOWN THE BARREL
OF MY SOUTH MOUTH.

40
00:02:39,571 --> 00:02:43,637
BUT I DON'T KNOW THEIR HEART
WASN'T IN IT.

41
00:02:44,578 --> 00:02:48,819
I SAW ONE OF THEM DO THIS LIKE --

42
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:52,390
I'M GOOD.
YOU KNOW, YOU CAN HAVE MY TURN.

43
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:55,574
ANYWAY, THAT'S WHEN TODD HERE
SHOWED UP.

44
00:02:55,945 --> 00:02:58,440
>> TODD, YOU LEFT THE BEINGS
MADE OF LIGHT?

45
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:01,801
>> I DID, SIR.
I GOT LOST ON THE WAY TO THE
BATHROOM.

46
00:03:01,801 --> 00:03:04,825
>> AND HOW DID THEY REACT WHEN
YOU WALKED INTO THE ROOM?

47
00:03:04,825 --> 00:03:09,662
>> LIKE MIDDLE SCHOOLERS MEETING
TAYLOR SWIFT.
THEY JUST MOBBED US.

48
00:03:09,662 --> 00:03:13,116
>> I WONDER WHAT WAS THE CAUSE
OF THE EXCITEMENT.

49
00:03:13,116 --> 00:03:15,425
>> CAN I THROW OUT A THEORY?

50
00:03:15,425 --> 00:03:19,863
THESE THINGS, THEY'RE SMOOTH
DOWN THERE.

51
00:03:20,481 --> 00:03:24,100
THEY'RE LIKE A BROKEN DOORBELL,
YOU KNOW?

52
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:25,455
NO DONG.

53
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:32,014
AND YOU KNOW, I'M WEARING MY
SEE-THROUGH ROBE,

54
00:03:32,014 --> 00:03:37,087
SO WHEN THEY
SAW THAT I WAS PACKING A TROLL NOSE,

55
00:03:38,905 --> 00:03:42,753
MY TROLL NOSE, YOU KNOW,
THEY JUST WENT RIGHT FOR IT.

56
00:03:42,753 --> 00:03:46,880
>> YEAH.
MY GRUMPY AND MY DUMPY WERE OLD NEWS

57
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:50,558
THE MINUTE THEY SAW TODD'S
TROLL NOSE HANGING THERE.

58
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:55,868
>> I'VE NEVER HEARD THE TERM
TROLL NOSE BEFORE.

59
00:03:55,868 --> 00:04:00,529
>> YOU MUST BE HANGING OUT AT A
DIFFERENT BOWLING ALLY THAN WE
DO, SIR.

60
00:04:00,529 --> 00:04:04,398
>> I'LL ASK THAT WE ALL STOP
SAYING TROLL NOSE, PLEASE.

61
00:04:04,398 --> 00:04:07,505
>> DURING THIS OR FOREVER?

62
00:04:07,505 --> 00:04:09,661
>> DURING THIS.

63
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:13,602
NOW, WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN THE
OTHER AREA OF THE SHIP?

64
00:04:13,602 --> 00:04:17,939
>> OH, THEY SHOWED A SINGLE ATOM
OF SOMETHING CALLED INFINITEM

65
00:04:17,939 --> 00:04:20,848
WHICH CAN POWER THE EARTH FOR
THOUSANDS OF YEARS.

66
00:04:20,848 --> 00:04:23,578
>> YEAH.
CUT TO WHERE I AM.

67
00:04:23,578 --> 00:04:27,768
TODD'S JUNK HAS WHIPPED THE
GRAYS INTO A FRENZY.

68
00:04:27,768 --> 00:04:30,135
THEY GOT HIM STOOD UP LIKE --

69
00:04:30,135 --> 00:04:33,011
WELL, TODD, DO YOU MIND?

70
00:04:36,406 --> 00:04:40,851
SO THEY'RE TAKING TURNS CHECKING
UNDER THE HOOD.

71
00:04:43,983 --> 00:04:47,609
THEY'RE LIKE
THIS REACHING UP,

72
00:04:47,609 --> 00:04:51,226
THEY'RE KIND
OF -- THEY'RE FLICKING IT.

73
00:04:52,131 --> 00:04:58,459
THEY'RE LIKE -- THEY'RE BATTING
AROUND LIKE A CAT.

74
00:04:58,459 --> 00:05:03,654
THEY'RE -- YOU KNOW, THEY'RE
SNIFFING IT.

75
00:05:06,728 --> 00:05:11,383
ONE GUY, HE TRIED TO WEAR IT
LIKE A HAT.

76
00:05:12,153 --> 00:05:16,070
HE HAD IT DRAPED OVER HIS NOSE
LIKE A VIKING HELMET.

77
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:22,132
AND THEN, ONE OF THOSE LUNATICS
GRABBED ON TO THIS THING,

78
00:05:22,132 --> 00:05:24,276
TRIED
TO HOIST HIMSELF UP.

79
00:05:24,276 --> 00:05:27,615
I SAID, CAREFUL, BUDDY.
LAST TIME I PULLED ON ONE THAT HARD,

80
00:05:27,615 --> 00:05:31,631
COP CHANGED HIS MIND AND
DID WRITE ME A TICKET.

81
00:05:38,007 --> 00:05:42,958
>> AND JUST IN CASE YOU'RE
WONDERING, I DID NOT BECOME
AROUSED.

82
00:05:42,958 --> 00:05:46,475
ANY TIME I FELT LIKE I MIGHT, I
JUST LOOKED AT COLLEEN HERE,

83
00:05:46,475 --> 00:05:48,956
AND
IT TOOK CARE OF IT FOR ME.
YOU KNOW?

84
00:05:48,956 --> 00:05:53,264
>> I'VE KILLED MORE CHUBBIES
THAN DIABETES.

85
00:05:53,264 --> 00:05:56,544
>> AND HOW WERE YOU ALL SENT
HOME?

86
00:05:56,544 --> 00:05:59,359
>> I WENT BACK TO THE SMART ALIENS,

87
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:03,377
AND THEY TOUCHED OUR
HEADS TO THEIRS, AND WE WERE
BACK ON EARTH.

88
00:06:03,377 --> 00:06:05,506
>> YEAH.
AND THEY GAVE ME THIS.

89
00:06:05,506 --> 00:06:08,597
THEY WANTED US TO HAVE IT TO
MAKE OUR WORLD BETTER.

90
00:06:08,681 --> 00:06:11,469
>> I ALSO GOT A FAREWELL SOUVENIR

91
00:06:11,469 --> 00:06:16,769
COURTESY OF ONE OF MY
GRAY PALS WHO BITCH SLAPPED ME OUT OF AN OPEN HATCH,

92
00:06:16,769 --> 00:06:21,557
AND THEN I
FALL 30 FEET AND I LAND FACE
DOWN WITH MY WEAN HOLE AND MY BEAN HOLE

93
00:06:21,557 --> 00:06:24,577
POINTED RIGHT AT KIM'S
FACE.

94
00:06:24,667 --> 00:06:28,886
>> KIM WHO?
>> JONG UN.

95
00:06:28,886 --> 00:06:31,391
BASTARDS DROPPED ME IN NORTH
KOREA.

96
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:35,121
BUT, HEY, NOT THE WORST PLACE
I'VE BEEN ON ALL FOURS.

97
00:06:35,121 --> 00:06:36,555

98
00:06:36,643 --> 00:06:41,199

THANK YOU.

103
00:09:20,527 --> 00:09:25,801
IT'S GREAT TO BE BACK HOSTING
SNL.

104
00:09:27,897 --> 00:09:33,353
I'M HERE BECAUSE OF MY NEW
MOVIE, "THE FALL GUY" WITH EMILY
BLUNT!

105
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:40,829
SO DON'T WORRY.
I'M NOT GOING TO MAKE ANY JOKES
ABOUT KEN.

106
00:09:40,829 --> 00:09:43,506
BECAUSE IT'S NOT FUNNY.

107
00:09:43,506 --> 00:09:48,639
KEN AND I, WE HAD TO BREAK UP.

108
00:09:48,735 --> 00:09:53,292
WE WENT TOO DEEP.
AND IT'S OVER.

109
00:09:53,292 --> 00:09:56,272
SO I'M NOT GONNA TALK ABOUT IT.

110
00:09:56,867 --> 00:10:00,900
I ACTUALLY AM GONNA TALK ABOUT
IT A LITTLE BIT.

111
00:10:01,923 --> 00:10:04,202
I HAVE TO.

112

00:31:05,997 --> 00:31:08,879
FROM THE
CARTOON BEAVIS AND BUTT-HEAD.

449
00:31:08,879 --> 00:31:10,661
JUST A LITTLE DISTRACTING.

450
00:31:10,661 --> 00:31:13,496
>> I'M NOT FAMILIAR WITH THAT CARTOON, 

451
00:31:13,496 --> 00:31:17,314
BUT WOULD IT HELP IF HE
MOVED SEATS?

452
00:31:17,314 --> 00:31:20,444
>> YEAH.
YEAH, THAT MIGHT BE A GOOD IDEA.

453
00:31:20,444 --> 00:31:24,703
IT'S THE GENTLEMAN IN THE BLUE
SHIRT AND BLOND.

454
00:31:28,274 --> 00:31:31,835
>> SIR, DO YOU MIND MOVING?

455
00:31:31,835 --> 00:31:35,736
>> I'M SORRY?
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT ME?

456
00:31:35,736 --> 00:31:39,182
I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT'S GOING ON.
I'M SORRY.
WHAT?

457
00:31:39,265 --> 00:31:41,966
>> YES.
CAN YOU MOVE SEATS?

458
00:31:41,966 --> 00:31:44,115
>> OKAY.
SURE.
I'M SORRY.

459
00:31:44,115 --> 00:31:53,110
I JUST -- I'VE NEVER HEARD OF

460
00:31:53,112 --> 00:31:56,246
THAT CARTOON CHARACTER, SO.

461
00:31:56,248 --> 00:31:58,615
>> AND YOU REALLY NEVER WATCHED

462
00:31:58,617 --> 00:31:59,650
BEAVIS AND BUTT-HEAD WHEN YOU

463
00:31:59,652 --> 00:32:00,884
WERE A TEENAGER?

464
00:32:00,886 --> 00:32:01,451
>> NO.

465
00:32:01,453 --> 00:32:03,553
I WAS PRETTY, SO I WAS GOING TO

466
00:32:03,555 --> 00:32:05,188
PARTIES AND HOOKING UP.

467
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:08,992
NOW, PROFESSOR, IF AI IS LEFT

468
00:32:08,994 --> 00:32:10,327
UNREGULATED, WHAT IS YOUR WORST

469
00:32:10,329 --> 00:32:11,128
CASE SCENARIO?

470
00:32:11,130 --> 00:32:17,834
>> WELL, IN SIMPLEST TERMS, IT

471
00:32:17,836 --> 00:32:19,536
BECOMES SO INTELLIGENT THAT IT

472
00:32:19,538 --> 00:32:20,237
DEEMS HUMANS UNNECESSARY AND

473
00:32:20,239 --> 00:32:20,704
KILLS US ALL.

474
00:32:20,706 --> 00:32:22,372
>> BUT IF HUMAN BEINGS CREATED

475
00:32:22,374 --> 00:32:24,841
THE AI, CAN'T WE JUST PROGRAM IT

476
00:32:24,843 --> 00:32:25,909
TO NOT DO THAT?

477
00:32:25,911 --> 00:32:26,977
>> WELL, IT DEPENDS.

478
00:32:26,979 --> 00:32:28,979
OH, MY GOD.

479
00:32:28,981 --> 00:32:30,647
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

480
00:32:30,649 --> 00:32:33,850
>> WHAT?

481
00:32:33,852 --> 00:32:36,386
I THINK THAT'S A VALID QUESTION.

482
00:32:36,388 --> 00:32:36,920
>> NO!

483
00:32:36,922 --> 00:32:38,055
NOW THERE'S A GENTLEMAN BEHIND

484
00:32:38,057 --> 00:32:40,891
YOU THAT LOOKS LIKE BUTT-HEAD.

485
00:32:40,893 --> 00:32:43,327
>> PROFESSOR, JUST BECAUSE OUR

486
00:32:43,329 --> 00:32:44,761
AUDIENCE MEMBERS AREN'T AS

487

488
00:32:46,265 --> 00:32:49,266
DOESN'T MAKE THEM BUTT-HEADS.

489
00:32:49,268 --> 00:32:51,468
>> BUTT-HEAD FROM THE CARTOON.

490
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:54,004
HE'S BEAVIS' FRIEND.

491
00:32:54,006 --> 00:32:55,405
>> I'D REALLY LIKE TO MOVE ON

492
00:32:55,407 --> 00:32:56,973
AND DISCUSS AI, SO WOULD YOU

493
00:32:56,975 --> 00:32:57,974
LIKE HIM TO MOVE?

494
00:32:57,976 --> 00:32:58,875
>> YES.

495
00:32:58,877 --> 00:32:59,609
THANK YOU.

496
00:32:59,611 --> 00:33:00,610
THE MAN WITH THE GRAY SHIRT AND

497
00:33:00,612 --> 00:33:05,949
EXPOSED GUMS.

498
00:33:05,951 --> 00:33:19,963
>> SIR --

499
00:33:24,770 --> 00:33:30,874
KINDLY MOVE SEATS.

500
00:33:30,876 --> 00:33:35,078
>> SHE'S TALKING TO YOU.

501
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:35,579
>> OH, I'M SORRY.

502
00:33:35,581 --> 00:33:36,279
ME?

503
00:33:36,281 --> 00:33:40,517
>> YES.

504
00:33:40,519 --> 00:33:43,320
>> I'M SO SORRY.

505
00:33:43,322 --> 00:33:44,354
I'M CONFUSED.

506
00:33:44,356 --> 00:33:49,893
I'M JUST HERE TO LEARN ABOUT AI.

507
00:33:49,895 --> 00:33:52,896

511
00:34:05,911 --> 00:34:07,043
>> THAT'S SOMETHING TROLLING.

512
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:09,012
THAT'S A REFERENCE TO THE

513

CARTOON.

514
00:34:09,481 --> 00:34:11,014

BUTT-HEAD?

530
00:34:35,741 --> 00:34:38,508
>> I'VE HEARD RUMBLINGS THAT I

531
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:41,378

MICHAEL CHE.

621
00:41:01,390 --> 00:41:04,264
>>> THANK YOU.
GOOD EVENING, EVERYONE.

622
00:41:04,264 --> 00:41:07,855
>> WELCOME TO "WEEKEND UPDATE."
I'M MICHAEL CHE.
>> I'M COLIN JOST.

623
00:41:09,609 --> 00:41:14,733
THE ARIZONA SUPREME COURT HAS
REINSTATED A LAW FROM 1864

624
00:41:14,733 --> 00:41:17,315
BANNING DOCTORS FROM PERFORMING
ABORTIONS.

625
00:41:17,315 --> 00:41:21,561
NOW, REINSTATING LAWS FROM 1864
ISN'T THE WORST THING FOR ME

626
00:41:21,561 --> 00:41:24,430
BECAUSE I'M A WHITE LAND OWNER.

627
00:41:24,430 --> 00:41:26,455
AND A PROUD FREE MASON.

628
00:41:26,455 --> 00:41:30,791
BUT IT'S PROBABLY NOT GREAT TO
ADOPT HEALTH CARE RULES FROM A TIME

629
00:41:30,791 --> 00:41:35,806
WHERE THE ONLY TWO THINGS
DOCTORS PRESCRIBED WERE PRAYER
AND COCAINE.

630
00:41:35,806 --> 00:41:38,195
SATURDAY AND SUNDAY.

631
00:41:40,144 --> 00:41:42,749
BACK THEN, IF YOU DIDN'T WANT TO
KEEP YOUR BABY,

632
00:41:42,749 --> 00:41:46,443
YOUR ONLY OPTION
WAS TO GIVE IT TO RUMPLE STILL
SKIN.

633
00:41:46,702 --> 00:41:50,513
PRESIDENT BIDEN CRITICIZED THE
ABORTION LAW CALLING IT CRUEL,

634
00:41:50,513 --> 00:41:56,001
WHICH IS
THE SAME THING HE SAID WHEN HE
VOTED AGAINST IT IN 1864.

635
00:41:57,270 --> 00:42:00,817
>> THIS WEEK, DONALD TRUMP SAID
THAT HE SUPPORTS ABORTION LAWS

636
00:42:00,817 --> 00:42:04,015
BEING DECIDED BY THE STATES
INSTEAD OF THE FEDERAL
GOVERNMENT.

637
00:42:04,015 --> 00:42:06,760
BUT WHY STOP THERE?
WHY NOT GO EVEN SMALLER

638
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:09,055
AND
LEAVE IT UP TO THE COUNTY OR THE CITY,

639
00:42:09,055 --> 00:42:12,085
OR EVEN BETTER, TAKE THE
GOVERNMENT OUT OF IT COMPLETELY

640
00:42:12,085 --> 00:42:15,085
AND LEAVE THE CHOICE ABOUT WHAT
WOMEN CAN DO WITH THEIR BODIES

641
00:42:15,085 --> 00:42:17,835
TO THE PERSON WHO KNOWS WHAT
THEY CAN DO WITH THEM THE BEST,

642
00:42:17,835 --> 00:42:20,218
THEIR HUSBANDS.

643
00:42:26,456 --> 00:42:30,277
>> IN A VIDEO ON TRUTH SOCIAL,
DONALD TRUMP FALSELY SAID

644
00:42:30,277 --> 00:42:34,015
THAT
DEMOCRATS SUPPORT ABORTION UP TO
THE NINTH MONTH AND BEYOND.

645
00:42:34,015 --> 00:42:37,699
SAYING, THE BABY IS EXECUTED
AFTER BIRTH.

646
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:41,823
BUT HE ONLY THINKS THAT HAPPENS
BECAUSE WHEN TRUMP WAS A BABY,

647
00:42:41,823 --> 00:42:45,607
A BUNCH OF TIME TRAVELERS SHOWED
UP TRYING TO KILL HIM.

648
00:42:46,370 --> 00:42:50,266
>> O.J. SIMPSON DIED THIS WEEK
AT THE AGE OF 76

649
00:42:50,266 --> 00:42:52,723
AFTER A BATTLE
WITH PROSTATE CANCER

650
00:42:52,723 --> 00:42:56,310
THAT WAS
PLANTED ON HIM BY THE LAPD.

651
00:42:59,207 --> 00:43:04,237
>> THERE WAS ACTUAL LISTEN AN
ERROR IN THE LA TIMES OBITUARY
FOR O.J. SIMPSON

652
00:43:04,237 --> 00:43:06,191
IN THE SECTION
ABOUT HIS PRISON TIME.

653
00:43:06,191 --> 00:43:10,223
INSTEAD OF WRITING OJ WALKED OUT
OF THE LOVE LAW CORRECTIONAL CENTER,

654
00:43:10,223 --> 00:43:14,137
THEY WROTE, TRUMP WALKED
OUT OF THE LOVE LAW CORRECTIONAL CENTER

655
00:43:14,137 --> 00:43:17,172
A FREE MAN FOR THE FIRST
TIME IN NINE YEARS.

656
00:43:17,172 --> 00:43:19,067
IT'S NOT A GREAT SIGN FOR TRUMP

657
00:43:19,067 --> 00:43:22,794
THAT EVEN AUTO CORRECT THINKS HE
BELONGS IN JAIL.

658
00:43:24,167 --> 00:43:27,413
>> PRESIDENT BIDEN MET WITH
JAPAN'S PRIME MINISTER

659
00:43:27,413 --> 00:43:30,452
WHERE
THEY DISCUSSED BUILDING A NEW
BULLET TRAIN SYSTEM IN AMERICA

660
00:43:30,452 --> 00:43:32,611
USING ADVANCED JAPANESE
TECHNOLOGY.

661
00:43:32,611 --> 00:43:35,877
IN RETURN, JAPAN REQUESTED THE
ADVANCED AMERICAN TECHNOLOGY

662
00:43:35,877 --> 00:43:37,965
OF
FORKS.

663
00:43:45,769 --> 00:43:51,018
A NEW REPORT FROM THE WHITE
HOUSE CLAIMS THAT PRESIDENT
BIDEN'S BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF STUDENT LOAN RELIEF

664
00:43:51,018 --> 00:43:53,287
WILL
DISPROPORTIONATELY HELP LATINOS

665
00:43:53,287 --> 00:43:57,845
WHICH HAS EARNED BIDEN THE
NICKNAME EL PAPA DESUGAR.

666
00:43:59,460 --> 00:44:03,739
>> YESTERDAY, MIKE JOHNSON,
WHOSE POSITION AS HOUSE SPEAKER IS IN JEOPARDY

667
00:44:03,739 --> 00:44:06,813
TRAVELED TO
MAR-A-LAGO FOR A MEETING WITH
DONALD TRUMP,

668
00:44:06,813 --> 00:44:09,890
AND BOY IS HIS JAW
TIRED.

669
00:44:19,755 --> 00:44:23,072
THAT EVENTUALLY GOT APPLAUSE?

670
00:44:24,275 --> 00:44:26,732
SENATOR MITCH McCONNELL SEEN HERE

671
00:44:26,732 --> 00:44:30,424
BEING TOLD A BLACK WOMAN
MADE A COUNTRY ALBUM --

672
00:44:35,581 --> 00:44:40,749
HAS COME OUT IN FAVOR OF A BILL
THAT WOULD POTENTIALLY BAN TICK
KNOCK IN THE U.S.

673
00:44:40,749 --> 00:44:42,700
OF COURSE, FOR McCONNELL, TIKTOK

674
00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:46,693
IS JUST WHAT THE GRIM REAPER
SAYS WHILE TAPPING HIS WATCH.

675
00:44:47,954 --> 00:44:52,924
>> THIS WEEK, THE TERM
WEAPONIZED INCOMPETENCE WAS TRENDING ON TIKTOK

676
00:44:52,924 --> 00:44:58,212
AS SOME WOMEN
WERE CALLING OUT THEIR MALE
PARTNERS FOR DOING SIMPLE TASKS
BAD ON PURPOSE

677
00:44:58,212 --> 00:44:59,637
SO THEY NEVER
HAVE TO DO IT AGAIN.

678
00:44:59,637 --> 00:45:03,990
HERE TO COMMENT IS OUR RESIDENT
BOYFRIEND MICHAEL LONGFELLOW.

679
00:45:12,098 --> 00:45:15,371
>> CHE, ALWAYS GOOD TO BE WITH
YOU, MY FRIEND.

680
00:45:15,371 --> 00:45:19,379
>> MICHAEL, HOW YOU DOING?
SO WHAT'S YOUR TAKE ON
WEAPONIZED INCOMPETENCE?

681
00:45:19,379 --> 00:45:21,009
>> WELL, I JUST LEARNED ABOUT IT

682
00:45:21,091 --> 00:45:24,788
BECAUSE MY GIRLFRIEND ASKED ME
TO BUY DISHWASHER SOAP,

683
00:45:24,788 --> 00:45:29,279
AND I
BOUGHT DISH SOAP, WHICH IS
DIFFERENT I GUESS.

684
00:45:29,279 --> 00:45:32,352
SO MY TAKE IS I TOTALLY GET HER POINT,

685
00:45:32,352 --> 00:45:36,333
BUT WHAT I NEED HER TO
UNDERSTAND IS I'M JUST
INCOMPETENT.

686
00:45:36,333 --> 00:45:39,602
AND I'M TRYING REALLY, REALLY
HARD.

687
00:45:39,602 --> 00:45:42,300
AND I LOVE YOU, GIRL.

688
00:45:42,409 --> 00:45:45,721
SO PLEASE, DON'T BE MAD AT ME.

689
00:45:46,554 --> 00:45:50,183
>> DO YOU THINK SHE MIGHT GET
UPSET ABOUT YOU SAYING ANY OF
THIS ON TV?

690
00:45:50,183 --> 00:45:54,949
>> NO.
SHE'LL BE UPSET BECAUSE I WAS
SUPPOSED TO PICK UP OUR CAT FROM
DAY CARE YESTERDAY,

691
00:45:54,949 --> 00:45:57,865
AND I'M
REALIZING AS I SPEAK I TOTALLY
FORGOT.

692
00:45:57,865 --> 00:46:00,834
>> MICHAEL, THAT'S NOT GREAT,
MAN.
>> THAT'S TERRIBLE.

693
00:46:00,834 --> 00:46:04,904
IN THE WORDS OF J. LO, THIS IS
ME.

694
00:46:05,616 --> 00:46:07,818
NOW.

695
00:46:07,818 --> 00:46:12,056
YOU KNOW WHAT?
LET ME JUST TALK TO THE LADIES
DIRECTLY FOR A SECOND.

696
00:46:12,056 --> 00:46:15,112
LET ME GET THE CAMERA.
>> I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD,
MAN.

697
00:46:15,112 --> 00:46:19,095
>> HEY, GIRLS.
IT'S LONGFELLOW.

698
00:46:19,095 --> 00:46:22,478
DON'T GET EXCITED.
IT'S JUST A NAME.

699
00:46:27,310 --> 00:46:28,654
SMALL WEINER JOKE.

700
00:46:28,654 --> 00:46:32,019
>> NO.
WE GOT IT, MAN.
WE GOT IT.
>> JUST A JOKE.

701
00:46:32,110 --> 00:46:36,270
LOOK, LADIES, WHAT ARE WE
FIGHTING ABOUT?

702
00:46:36,270 --> 00:46:38,629
THIS ISN'T US.

703
00:46:38,709 --> 00:46:41,461
YES, MEN SOMETIMES MESS UP TASKS

704
00:46:41,461 --> 00:46:43,310
SO SIMPLE THAT A CHILD COULD DO THEM,

705
00:46:43,310 --> 00:46:45,860
BUT, GIRL, THAT'S
SOCIETY'S FAULT.

706
00:46:45,860 --> 00:46:50,961
THAT'S NOT US BEING WEAPONS.
THE ONLY WEAPONS I OWN, RIGHT
HERE.

707
00:46:51,546 --> 00:46:54,145
AND THEY'RE FOR PROTECTING YOU,
GIRL.

708
00:46:54,145 --> 00:46:57,354
AS LONG AS HE'S SMALLER THAN ME.

709
00:46:57,354 --> 00:46:59,883
SICK IF POSSIBLE.

710
00:46:59,883 --> 00:47:05,249
>> THAT'S YOUR POINT?
>> I FORGOT TO THINK OF ONE.

711
00:47:05,249 --> 00:47:07,933
I KNOW I NEED TO BE BETTER, BUT
HERE'S THE TRUTH.

712
00:47:07,933 --> 00:47:10,779
IF I LIVED ALONE, I WOULD HAVE ONE PLATE,

713
00:47:10,779 --> 00:47:13,604
I WOULD NEVER COOK, I
WOULD ORDER FOOD,

714
00:47:13,678 --> 00:47:16,801
PUT THE
TAKEOUT BOXES ON TOP OF THE TRASH CAN,

715
00:47:16,801 --> 00:47:20,559
AND WHEN THE BOXES
TOUCH THE CEILING, MOVE BACK IN
WITH MY MOM.

716
00:47:20,630 --> 00:47:24,474
THAT'S A GOOD LIFE TO ME.
I'M OKAY LIVING LIKE THAT.

717
00:47:24,474 --> 00:47:27,879
YOU'RE NOT, KATE.

718
00:47:27,879 --> 00:47:32,740
>> YOU JUST SAY YOUR
GIRLFRIEND'S REAL NAME?
>> YEAH.
OOPSY.

719
00:47:32,740 --> 00:47:38,123
LET'S TURN THE TABLES.
LET'S TALK ABOUT WEAPONIZED
COMPETENCE.

720
00:47:38,123 --> 00:47:40,469
>> WEAPONIZED COMPETENCE?
>> YEAH.

721
00:47:40,469 --> 00:47:42,334
WOMEN.

722
00:47:43,177 --> 00:47:45,068
YOU'RE TOO COMPETENT.

723
00:47:45,068 --> 00:47:47,275
WHY DO YOU KNOW HOW TO DO ALL
THIS STUFF?

724
00:47:47,275 --> 00:47:51,218
HOW DO YOU KNOW THE WORD DUVET?
WHO TOLD YOU THAT?

725
00:47:51,218 --> 00:47:55,729
I'VE BEEN LIVING ON THE SAME
EARTH AS YOU, GIRL.
NEVER ONCE HEARD DUVET.

726
00:47:55,729 --> 00:47:58,886
NOW YOU'RE MAD AT ME BECAUSE I
DON'T KNOW HOW TO PUT IT ON?

727
00:47:58,886 --> 00:48:01,801
PUT WHAT ON WHAT?

728
00:48:01,801 --> 00:48:03,477
>> HE'S GOT SOME GOOD POINTS.

729
00:48:03,477 --> 00:48:08,228
MICHAEL LONGFELLOW, EVERYBODY.
>> I'M SO SORRY, BABE!

730
00:48:13,142 --> 00:48:15,965
>> IN A NEW INTERVIEW, BILLY D.
WILLIAMS SAYS

731
00:48:15,965 --> 00:48:18,463
THAT ACTORS SHOULD
BE ALLOWED TO DO BLACK FACE,

732
00:48:18,531 --> 00:48:21,829
ADDING IF YOU'RE AN ACTOR, YOU
SHOULD DO ANYTHING YOU WANT TO
DO.

733
00:48:21,829 --> 00:48:25,180
EXACTLY, SAID KEVIN SPACEY.

734
00:48:26,856 --> 00:48:29,702
>> NEW YORK CITY --

735
00:48:29,702 --> 00:48:32,887
>> THEY LIKES IT.
>> NO, THEY DIDN'T LIKE IT.

736
00:48:32,887 --> 00:48:36,264
NEW YORK CITY OFFICIALS ARE
CONSIDERING CONTROLLING

737
00:48:36,264 --> 00:48:39,746
THE
CITY'S RAPID GROWING POPULATION
BY USING BIRTH PELLETS,

738
00:48:39,746 --> 00:48:45,093
WHICH
WILL FINALLY LET FEMALE RATS
FOCUS ON THEIR CAREERS.

739
00:48:49,845 --> 00:48:53,387
>> THE TSA REPORTS IN THE FIRST
THREE MONTHS OF THIS YEAR,

740
00:48:53,387 --> 00:48:58,007
THEY
HAVE INTERCEPTED 1,500 GUNS IN
CARRY-ON BAGS,

741
00:48:58,007 --> 00:49:00,085
AND THE MAJORITY
OF THEM WERE LOADED,

742
00:49:00,085 --> 00:49:03,978
'CUZ YOU'RE
GIVING ME THAT WINDOW SEAT.

743
00:49:08,004 --> 00:49:10,650
>> YOU ARE A STUPID MAN.

744
00:49:10,650 --> 00:49:14,831
72-YEAR-OLD JERRY TURNER FROM
THE GOLDEN BACHELOR ANNOUNCED

745
00:49:14,832 --> 00:49:19,456
THAT HE AND HIS 70-YEAR-OLD WIFE
ARE DIVORCING AFTER THREE MONTHS
OF MARRIAGE.

746
00:49:19,456 --> 00:49:22,279
BUT LIKE THEY SAY, THERE'S STILL
PLENTY OF FISH IN THE SEA --

747
00:49:22,279 --> 00:49:24,002
METARY.

748
00:49:27,155 --> 00:49:31,881
SEAMETARY, COLIN.
>> REALLY GOOD.

749
00:49:31,881 --> 00:49:37,289
IT WAS ANNOUNCED THAT A MUSICAL
VERSION OF LORD OF THE RINGS
WILL OPEN IN CHICAGO,

750
00:49:37,289 --> 00:49:40,701
SO IF YOU
LOVE MUSICALS AND YOU LOVE LORD
OF THE RINGS,

751
00:49:40,701 --> 00:49:43,431
HIGH SCHOOL MUST
HAVE BEEN A TOUGH TIME.

752
00:49:45,828 --> 00:49:49,082
TRUST ME, I KNOW.

753
00:49:54,479 --> 00:49:58,745
>> THE UNIVERSITY OF IOWA
ANNOUNCED THAT BASKETBALL STAR
CAITLIN CLARK

754
00:49:58,745 --> 00:50:00,630
WILL HAVE HER
JERSEY RETIRED.

755
00:50:00,630 --> 00:50:03,597
AND REPLACED WITH AN APRON.

756
00:50:07,129 --> 00:50:12,672
WELL, THE WNBA DRAFT IS THIS
MONDAY,

757
00:50:12,672 --> 00:50:16,235
AND IOWA STAR CAITLIN
CLARK IS EXPECTED TO BE THE
NUMBER ONE PICK.

758
00:50:16,235 --> 00:50:19,595
HERE TO COMMENT IS CAITLIN
CLARK.

759
00:50:37,574 --> 00:50:40,774
ME

760
00:50:40,833 --> 00:50:43,501
>> BUT NOTHING FOR MY JOKE?
WHATEVER.

761
00:50:43,501 --> 00:50:46,454
I AM A FAN, CAITLIN, BY THE WAY.

762
00:50:46,454 --> 00:50:49,760
>> REALLY, MICHAEL?
BECAUSE I HEARD THAT LITTLE
APRON JOKE YOU DID.

763
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:52,210
>> YEAH.
IT WAS A JOKE.
WE'RE JUST HAVING FUN.
YOU KNOW?

764
00:50:52,273 --> 00:50:55,436
>> YOU MAKE A LOT OF JOKES ABOUT
WOMEN'S SPORTS.
DON'T YOU, MICHAEL?

765
00:50:55,436 --> 00:50:58,601
>> I WOULDN'T SAY A LOT.
IT'S NOT ON THE REGULAR.

766
00:50:58,601 --> 00:51:01,060
>> IT'S DEFINITELY A LOT.

767
00:51:01,060 --> 00:51:03,883
I ACTUALLY SORT OF MADE A SUPER
CUT.
TAKE A LOOK.

768
00:51:03,883 --> 00:51:04,759
>> WELL, NO, WE DON'T HAVE TO --

769
00:51:04,759 --> 00:51:08,019
A NUMBER OF SPORTS BARS AROUND
THE COUNTRY ARE PROMISING

770
00:51:08,019 --> 00:51:11,435
TO ONLY SHOW WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
GAMES DURING MARCH MADNESS.

771
00:51:11,435 --> 00:51:15,450
THE BARS ARE KNOWN COLLECTIVELY
AS THE EMPTY ONES.

772
00:51:15,523 --> 00:51:20,644
A NEW REPORT CLAIMS THAT RECENT
STORIES ON THE SPORTS ILLUSTRATED WEBSITE

773
00:51:20,644 --> 00:51:22,758
WERE
ACTUALLY GENERATED BY AI,

774
00:51:22,758 --> 00:51:25,407
AND
IT'S ALREADY MAKING GLARING
MISTAKES, FOR INSTANCE,

775
00:51:25,407 --> 00:51:29,006
IT MADE
UP SOMETHING CALLED THE WNBA?

776
00:51:29,364 --> 00:51:32,560
IOWA'S FINAL FOUR GAME AGAINST
UCONN

777
00:51:32,560 --> 00:51:35,928
WAS THE MOST WATCHED
WOMEN'S COLLEGE BASKETBALL GAME EVER

778
00:51:35,928 --> 00:51:38,844
WITH 14.2 MILLION VIEWERS,

779
00:51:38,844 --> 00:51:43,968
BEATING THE PREVIOUS RECORD BY
14.2 MILLION VIEWERS.

780
00:51:44,464 --> 00:51:47,510
>> WOW.
COLIN WITH THE RECEIPTS.
THANKS, MAN.

781
00:51:47,510 --> 00:51:51,374
>> NO PROBLEM.
UNLIKE CHE, I SUPPORT WOMEN.

782
00:51:52,686 --> 00:52:00,699
>> HOLD ON.

783
00:52:00,701 --> 00:52:01,800
I THINK YOU'RE A GREAT

784
00:52:01,802 --> 00:52:03,636
BASKETBALL PLAYER.

785
00:52:03,638 --> 00:52:04,570
I CAN'T PLAY LIKE YOU DO.

786
00:52:04,572 --> 00:52:05,237
>> YEAH.

787
00:52:05,239 --> 00:52:08,107
WE KNOW.

788
00:52:08,109 --> 00:52:11,110
OBVIOUSLY, I CAN'T TELL JOKES

789
00:52:11,112 --> 00:52:11,544
LIKE YOU DO.

790
00:52:11,546 --> 00:52:12,144
>> THANK YOU FOR THAT.

791
00:52:12,146 --> 00:52:14,246
>> BUT I DID WRITE SOME JOKES.

792
00:52:14,248 --> 00:52:15,848
IT WOULD MEAN A LOT TO ME IF YOU

793
00:52:15,850 --> 00:52:18,450
READ SOME OF THEM.

794
00:52:18,452 --> 00:52:20,219
JUST RIGHT OVER THERE ON THE

795
00:52:20,221 --> 00:52:20,719
CARDS.

796
00:52:20,721 --> 00:52:23,689
>> WELL -- THE INDIANA FEVER

797
00:52:23,691 --> 00:52:26,692
HAVE THE FIRST PICK IN THIS

798
00:52:26,694 --> 00:52:28,427
MONDAY'S DRAFT, A REMINDER THAT

799
00:52:28,429 --> 00:52:30,829
INDIANA FEVER IS A WNBA TEAM AND

800
00:52:30,831 --> 00:52:33,832
NOT WHAT MICHAEL CHE GAVE TO

801
00:52:33,834 --> 00:52:35,768
DOZENS OF WOMEN AT PURDUE

802
00:52:35,770 --> 00:52:36,168
UNIVERSITY.

803
00:52:36,170 --> 00:52:37,503
>> SEE?

804
00:52:37,505 --> 00:52:38,237
THAT'S A GOOD JOKE ABOUT WOMEN'S

805
00:52:38,239 --> 00:52:39,572
SPORTS.

806
00:52:39,574 --> 00:52:43,576
TRY ANOTHER ONE.

807
00:52:43,578 --> 00:52:45,177
>> YOU REALLY WROTE THESE

808
00:52:45,179 --> 00:52:45,978
YOURSELF?

809
00:52:45,980 --> 00:52:47,379
>> YEAH.

810
00:52:47,381 --> 00:52:49,715
>> NETFLIX TOP SHOW IS RIPLY

811
00:52:49,717 --> 00:52:52,585
FEATURING AN EERIE UNSETTLING

812
00:52:52,587 --> 00:52:55,421
PERFORMANCE BY ACTOR ANDREW

00:52:55,423 --> 00:52:55,721
SCOTT.

814
00:52:55,723 --> 00:52:57,723
CRITICS SAY IT'S THE HARDEST

815
00:52:57,725 --> 00:53:01,160
THING TO WATCH ON NETFLIX SINCE

816
00:53:01,162 --> 00:53:03,862
MICHAEL CHE'S SPECIAL SHAME THE

817
00:53:03,864 --> 00:53:04,196

00:53:04,732 --> 00:53:05,197
THERE'S MORE.

820
00:53:05,199 --> 00:53:07,700

00:53:07,702 --> 00:53:10,569
BROKE THE RECORD FOR

822

00:53:30,258 --> 00:53:32,925
I HOPE YOU HAVE A GREAT FIRST

833
00:53:32,927 --> 00:53:33,259

MAYA MOORE.

841
00:53:46,307 --> 00:53:47,806
THESE ARE THE GIRLS THAT KICKED

842
00:53:47,808 --> 00:53:50,142
DOWN THE DOOR SO I COULD WALK

843
00:53:50,144 --> 00:53:50,476
INSIDE.

844
00:53:50,478 --> 00:53:52,144
I WANT TO THANK THEM FOR LAYING

845
00:53:52,146 --> 00:53:53,746

IT'S AN APRON SIGNED BY ME.

849
00:54:04,792 --> 00:54:05,324
>> THANK YOU.

850
00:54:05,326 --> 00:54:07,660
I CAN'T WAIT TO GIVE THIS TO MY

851
00:54:07,662 --> 00:54:08,060
GIRLFRIEND.

852
00:54:08,062 --> 00:54:08,827
>> YOU DON'T HAVE A GIRLFRIEND,

853
00:54:08,829 --> 00:54:09,161
MICHAEL.

854
00:54:09,163 --> 00:54:11,363
>> ALL RIGHT.

855
00:54:11,365 --> 00:54:15,768
CAITLIN CLARK, EVERYBODY.

856
00:54:15,770 --> 00:54:33,819
FOR

857
00:54:40,994 --> 00:54:46,331
>> I CAN'T BELIEVE HE'S BEEN IN

858
00:54:46,333 --> 00:54:47,299
SURGERY FOR 12 HOURS.

859
00:54:47,301 --> 00:54:48,000
>> THANK YOU ALL FOR WAITING.

860
00:54:48,002 --> 00:54:49,601
THE DOCTOR WILL SEE YOU NOW.

861
00:54:49,603 --> 00:54:54,306
>> HELLO, FAMILY.

862
00:54:54,308 --> 00:54:56,775
WELL, THIS IS NEVER EASY TO SAY.

863
00:54:56,777 --> 00:54:58,510
WE DID EVERYTHING WE COULD, BUT

864
00:54:58,512 --> 00:55:00,112
HE DID NOT MAKE IT.

865
00:55:00,114 --> 00:55:01,180
>> OH, MY GOD.

866
00:55:01,182 --> 00:55:02,781
>> IT'S OKAY, GUYS.

867
00:55:02,783 --> 00:55:04,149
HE LIVED A LONG LIFE.

868
00:55:04,151 --> 00:55:05,350
>> IF IT'S ANY COMFORT, IT'S NOT

869
00:55:05,352 --> 00:55:09,054
MY FAULT.

870
00:55:09,056 --> 00:55:09,922
>> OKAY.

871
00:55:09,924 --> 00:55:10,222
YEAH.

872
00:55:10,224 --> 00:55:12,391
WE DIDN'T THINK IT WAS ANYONE'S

873
00:55:12,393 --> 00:55:12,691
FAULT.

874
00:55:12,693 --> 00:55:14,727
>> MM, SO WE AGREE.

875
00:55:14,729 --> 00:55:16,228
IT'S NOT MY FAULT.

876
00:55:16,230 --> 00:55:17,830
COULD EACH OF YOU SAY THAT ONE

877
00:55:17,832 --> 00:55:19,264
AT A TIME, PLEASE?

878
00:55:19,266 --> 00:55:20,999
>> DO NOT RECORD US RIGHT NOW.

879
00:55:21,001 --> 00:55:22,701
>> DOCTOR, CAN WE PLEASE HAVE A

880
00:55:22,703 --> 00:55:23,302
MOMENT TO PROCESS THIS?

881
00:55:23,304 --> 00:55:27,940
>> OKAY.

882
00:55:27,942 --> 00:55:30,209
>> WELL, MAYBE WE SHOULD ALL GO

883
00:55:30,211 --> 00:55:32,344
AROUND AND SAY SOMETHING WE

884
00:55:32,346 --> 00:55:33,579
LOVED ABOUT GRANDPA.

885
00:55:33,581 --> 00:55:35,681
>> I THINK THAT WOULD BE NICE.

886
00:55:35,683 --> 00:55:37,149
>> I LOVE THE WAY THAT HE

887
00:55:37,151 --> 00:55:37,516
SMELLED.

888
00:55:37,518 --> 00:55:39,918
>> HELLO, AGAIN.

889
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:41,854
THIS IS MY ASSOCIATE.

890
00:55:41,856 --> 00:55:42,755
HE WAS IN THE OPERATING ROOM

891
00:55:42,757 --> 00:55:43,489
WITH ME.

892
00:55:43,491 --> 00:55:45,324
HE HAS SOMETHING HE WANTS TO

893
00:55:45,326 --> 00:55:45,724
TELL YOU.

894
00:55:45,726 --> 00:55:46,859
>> I'M SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS.

895
00:55:46,861 --> 00:55:49,962
>> AND?

896
00:55:49,964 --> 00:55:50,863
>> I DIDN'T DROP ANYTHING IN

897
00:55:50,865 --> 00:55:54,767
ANYTHING.

898
00:55:54,769 --> 00:55:56,435
>> SEE, NOW THAT MAKES IT SEEM

899
00:55:56,437 --> 00:55:57,069
LIKE YOU DID.

900
00:55:57,071 --> 00:55:59,138
>> NO, I DIDN'T.

901
00:55:59,140 --> 00:56:01,774
HE WAS VERY OLD, VERY SICK, AND

902
00:56:01,776 --> 00:56:04,109
THERE WAS ALREADY AN AIRPOD

903
00:56:04,111 --> 00:56:04,676
INSIDE OF HIM.

904
00:56:04,678 --> 00:56:05,511
>> OKAY.

905
00:56:05,513 --> 00:56:07,279
YOU KNOW WHAT, MAYBE WE SHOULD

906
00:56:07,281 --> 00:56:08,747
GET OUT OF THIS WAITING ROOM.

907
00:56:08,749 --> 00:56:09,281
>> YEAH.

908
00:56:09,283 --> 00:56:12,518
COME ON, KIDS, LET'S GO TO THE

909
00:56:12,520 --> 00:56:12,918
CAFETERIA.

910
00:56:12,920 --> 00:56:13,986
>> OH, ARE YOU HUNGRY?

911
00:56:13,988 --> 00:56:15,788
WOULD YOU LIKE TO TRY SOME

912
00:56:15,790 --> 00:56:16,955
COOKIE CRUMBLES?

913
00:56:16,957 --> 00:56:19,992
>> WHAT ARE COOKIE CRUMBLES?

914
00:56:19,994 --> 00:56:21,293
>> THEY'RE MY OWN CREATION.

915
00:56:21,295 --> 00:56:23,061
SOMETIMES YOU DON'T WANT A WHOLE

916
00:56:23,063 --> 00:56:25,597
COOKIE, YOU JUST WANT A BITE.

917
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:26,665
>> DID YOU HAVE THAT ON YOU

918
00:56:26,667 --> 00:56:27,766
DURING THE SURGERY?

919
00:56:27,768 --> 00:56:30,936
>> WE HAD A FEW SPOONFULS, YES.

920
00:56:30,938 --> 00:56:33,338
THAT'S HOW YOU EAT THEM, WITH A

921
00:56:33,340 --> 00:56:34,072
LITTLE RED SPOON.

922
00:56:34,074 --> 00:56:35,841
IT WOULD COME WITH IT.

923
00:56:35,843 --> 00:56:36,508
>> UM, ARE YOU LIKE SELLING

924

>> YOU WANT MY NUMBER?

1095
01:04:43,397 --> 01:04:44,729
WHICH NUMBER DO YOU WANT,

1096
01:04:44,731 --> 01:04:45,063
GEORGE?

1097
01:04:45,065 --> 01:04:46,564
BECAUSE I GOT NUMBERS COMING OUT

1098
01:04:46,566 --> 01:04:47,766
OF MY EARS.

1099
01:04:47,768 --> 01:04:49,134
FOR INSTANCE, TEN, THAT'S HOW

1100
01:04:49,136 --> 01:04:53,571
MANY MONTHS OLD MY BABY GIRL IS.

1101
01:04:53,573 --> 01:04:54,906
SIX, THAT'S HOW OLD MY OTHER

1102
01:04:54,908 --> 01:04:55,607
DAUGHTER IS.

1103
01:04:55,609 --> 01:04:57,509
TWO IS HOW MANY TIMES I'VE BEEN

1104
01:04:57,511 --> 01:04:58,677
MARRIED AND DIVORCED, AND WITH

1105
01:04:58,679 --> 01:05:01,046
ALL THE NUMBERS I GAVE YOU, I'M

1106
01:05:01,048 --> 01:05:02,914
GUESSING ZERO IS THE NUMBER OF

1107
01:05:02,916 --> 01:05:04,749
TIMES I'LL BE HEARING FROM YOU,

1108
01:05:04,751 --> 01:05:05,083
GEORGE.

1109
01:05:05,085 --> 01:05:06,551
SO GOOD NIGHT.

1110
01:05:06,553 --> 01:05:07,319
MAYBE YOU CAN WRITE ME A LETTER

1111
01:05:07,321 --> 01:05:07,686
SOMETIME.

1112
01:05:07,688 --> 01:05:10,388
>> LETTER?

1113
01:05:10,390 --> 01:05:15,994
HERE'S A LETTER FOR YOU.

1114
01:05:15,996 --> 01:05:18,863
Y, THE THING I ASK MY WIFE AND

1115
01:05:18,865 --> 01:05:22,100
MY DAD WHEN HE LEFT.

1116
01:05:22,102 --> 01:05:28,139
U, THE ANSWER MY MAMA GAVE ME.

1117
01:05:28,141 --> 01:05:30,141
K, WHAT MY DAD TEXT BACK AFTER I

1118
01:05:30,143 --> 01:05:32,544
SAY I LOVE HIM.

1119
01:05:32,546 --> 01:05:35,413
J, WHAT I SMOKE TO FORGET MY

1120
01:05:35,415 --> 01:05:36,181
ROTTEN PAST.

1121
01:05:36,183 --> 01:05:37,415
AND O, THE THING I HAVE NEVER

1122
01:05:37,417 --> 01:05:42,320
GIVEN A WOMAN.

1123
01:05:42,322 --> 01:05:44,756
SO, YEAH, MAYBE NEXT TIME DON'T

1124
01:05:44,758 --> 01:05:45,757
JUDGE A BOOK BY ITS COVER.

1125
01:05:45,759 --> 01:05:49,327
>> BOOK?

1126
01:05:49,329 --> 01:05:52,397
DID YOU SAY BOOK?

1127
01:05:52,399 --> 01:05:53,631
LITTLE WOMEN, THAT'S WHAT I CALL

1128
01:05:53,633 --> 01:05:56,301
MY 30 DAUGHTERS.

1129
01:05:56,303 --> 01:05:58,436
>> I THOUGHT YOU HAD TWO.

1130
01:05:58,438 --> 01:06:02,140
>> FAHRENHEIT 451, WHAT I PUT

1131
01:06:02,142 --> 01:06:04,309
THE OVEN AT TO MAKE THEM THEIR

1132
01:06:04,311 --> 01:06:07,011
SAD GRAY MEATLOAF.

1133
01:06:07,013 --> 01:06:08,313
EXTREMELY LOUD AND INCREDIBLY

1134
01:06:08,315 --> 01:06:09,047
CLOSE, THAT'S HOW I LIKE TO DO

1135
01:06:09,049 --> 01:06:11,416
IT.

1136
01:06:11,418 --> 01:06:12,584
>> WOW.

1137
01:06:12,586 --> 01:06:13,218
>> YEAH.

1138
01:06:13,220 --> 01:06:15,186
YOU COULDN'T HANDLE MY LIFE,

1139
01:06:15,188 --> 01:06:15,520
GEORGE.

1140
01:06:15,522 --> 01:06:16,488
TRUST ME.

1141
01:06:16,490 --> 01:06:17,222
WE'RE BETTER OFF BEING FRIENDS.

1142
01:06:17,224 --> 01:06:19,324
>> FRIENDS?

1143
01:06:19,326 --> 01:06:21,893
YOU SAY FRIENDS?

1144
01:06:21,895 --> 01:06:29,701
WELL, I KNOW SOME FRIENDS.

1145
01:06:29,703 --> 01:06:34,439
CHANDLER, RACHEL, JOEY, ROSS,

1146
01:06:34,441 --> 01:06:35,440
MONICA, PHOEBE, AND CENTRAL

01:06:35,442 --> 01:06:38,009
PERK.

1148
01:06:38,011 --> 01:06:44,282
NOT A PERSON, BUT UNDENIABLY A

1149
01:06:44,284 --> 01:06:45,450
CHARACTER IN THAT SHOW.

1150
01:06:45,452 --> 01:06:46,684
>> WILL Y'ALL PLEASE SHUT UP?

1151
01:06:46,686 --> 01:06:48,386
I LIVE ACROSS THE STREET AND I

1152
01:06:48,388 --> 01:06:49,854
CAN'T GET A WINK OF SLEEP.

1153
01:06:49,856 --> 01:06:51,189
>> SORRY ABOUT THAT.

1154
01:06:51,191 --> 01:06:53,725
WE DIDN'T MEAN TO MAKE SO MUCH

1155
01:06:53,727 --> 01:06:54,058
NOISE.

1156
01:06:54,060 --> 01:06:54,426
>> NOISE?

1157
01:06:54,428 --> 01:06:54,959
DID YOU SAY NOISE?

1158
01:06:54,961 --> 01:07:00,098
I KNOW A COUPLE NOISES.

1159
01:07:00,100 --> 01:07:02,200
BEEP BEEP, THAT'S THE SOUND OF

1160
01:07:02,202 --> 01:07:04,736
MY EX-WIFE'S CAR PARKED OUTSIDE

1161
01:07:04,738 --> 01:07:07,572
MY HOUSE.

1162
01:07:07,574 --> 01:07:08,573
HA-HA-HA, THAT'S THE SOUND OF

1163
01:07:08,575 --> 01:07:09,941
CHILDREN LAUGHING AT ME WHEN I

1164
01:07:09,943 --> 01:07:14,679
TRY TO LEARN HOW TO SKATEBOARD.

1165
01:07:14,681 --> 01:07:16,815
WEE, WEE, WEE, THAT'S THE SOUND

1166
01:07:16,817 --> 01:07:20,718
OF BATS FLYING AROUND MY ATTIC.

1167
01:07:20,720 --> 01:07:21,453
POW!

1168
01:07:21,455 --> 01:07:23,621
THAT'S ME DOING KARATE ON THE

1169
01:07:23,623 --> 01:07:23,922
BATS.

1170
01:07:23,924 --> 01:07:26,057
HOW'S THAT FOR SOUND?

1171
01:07:26,059 --> 01:07:28,393
>> IT'S GOOD.

1172
01:07:28,395 --> 01:07:31,329
IT'S REALLY GOOD.

1173
01:07:31,331 --> 01:07:34,199
>> BUT YOU'VE CONVINCED ME I'D

1174
01:07:34,201 --> 01:07:34,933
LOVE TO GET THAT DINNER.

1175
01:07:34,935 --> 01:07:37,101
>> GREAT.

1176
01:07:37,103 --> 01:07:37,702
CAN I HAVE YOUR NUMBER?

1177
01:07:37,704 --> 01:07:39,003
>> NUMBER?

1178
01:07:39,005 --> 01:07:39,337
>> OH.

1179
01:07:39,339 --> 01:07:41,072
>> NO.

1180
01:07:41,074 --> 01:07:45,610
WE ARE NOT DOING THIS AGAIN.

1181
01:08:22,915 --> 01:08:33,691
McKINNON!

1182
01:08:33,693 --> 01:08:39,564
