1
00:00:02,384 --> 00:00:04,414
PENTAGON

2
00:00:04,414 --> 00:00:06,926
>>> THANK YOU ALL FOR COMING.

3
00:00:11,969 --> 00:00:15,936
I AM DR. PAP AND THIS IS SPECIAL
AGENT FITZSIMMONS WITH THE FSA.

4
00:00:15,936 --> 00:00:18,810
>> YOU'RE ALL HERE BECAUSE
YOU'VE EXPERIENCED

5
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:22,055
A VERIFIED
ALIEN ABDUCTION.

6
00:00:22,055 --> 00:00:24,377
>> YEAH.

7
00:00:28,711 --> 00:00:30,537
YOU KNOW, IT WAS WILD.

8
00:00:30,537 --> 00:00:32,861
ONE SECOND, WE'RE THREE FRIENDS
ON A CAMPING TRIP,

9
00:00:32,861 --> 00:00:36,030
AND THE NEXT
WE'RE CITIZENS OF THE STARS.

10
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:39,044
>> AND, SIR, BEFORE WE BEGIN,
MAY I SAY SOMETHING?

11
00:00:39,044 --> 00:00:44,155
I'M JUST REALIZING THAT I WAS
WEARING THE SAME OUTFIT THE LAST
TIME I WAS HERE.

12
00:00:44,155 --> 00:00:48,016
I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW I DO
HAVE OTHER CLOTHES.

13
00:00:48,016 --> 00:00:49,180
>> NOTED.

14
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:52,375
NOW, HOW WERE YOU ALL BROUGHT ON
BOARD THE CRAFT?

15
00:00:52,375 --> 00:00:55,056
>> WELL, WE WERE HIT WITH THIS
WARM SOFT LIGHT,

16
00:00:55,056 --> 00:00:59,829
AND THEN WE
MATERIALIZED ON THE SPACESHIP
BETWEEN THESE TWO GLOWING BEAMS.

17
00:00:59,829 --> 00:01:01,533
>> AND OUR CLOTHES WERE GONE,

18
00:01:01,533 --> 00:01:05,864
BUT WE WERE WEARING THESE COMFY
ROBES MADE OF TRANSPARENT LIGHT.

19
00:01:05,864 --> 00:01:09,165
>> AND YOU, MS. RAFFERTY?

20
00:01:19,331 --> 00:01:21,839
>> LITTLE DIFFERENT FOR ME.

21
00:01:22,147 --> 00:01:25,959
I WAS BY THE LAKE TAKING A WHORE
BATH.

22
00:01:25,959 --> 00:01:28,920
IT'S WHEN YOU WASH THE PITS AND
BITS.

23
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:34,324
THEN OUT OF NOWHERE, I GET
SUCKED UP BY A GIANT VACUUM CLEANER HOSE,

24
00:01:35,651 --> 00:01:39,047
AND I LAND ON THE
SHIP, STILL PANTSLESS, MIND YOU,

25
00:01:39,047 --> 00:01:43,188
SO MY JOUSER AND MY DEUCER ARE ON FULL DISPLAY,

26
00:01:43,188 --> 00:01:47,250
AND I SEE MY
OLD BUDDIES THE GRAY ALIENS WITH
THE BIG DUMB EYES,

27
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:50,286
AND IT HITS
ME I'VE BEEN ON THIS SPACESHIP

28
00:01:50,286 --> 00:01:53,801
MORE TIMES THAN I'VE BEEN TO A
DENTIST.

29
00:01:54,247 --> 00:01:57,483
I SEE.
AND ONCE ABOARD THE SHIP,
WHAT HAPPENED.

30
00:01:57,483 --> 00:02:00,565
>> >> WELL, THE ALIENS TAUGHT US
A UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE.

31
00:02:00,565 --> 00:02:03,647
THE CLOSEST WE HAVE TO IT IS
LOVE.

32
00:02:03,647 --> 00:02:07,724
>> IT'S A SOOTHING BEAUTIFUL
SOUND.

33
00:02:07,724 --> 00:02:11,615
I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN DO IT
JUSTICE, BUT IT'S LIKE A --

34
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:20,687
I
DIDN'T DO IT JUSTICE I DON'T
THINK.

35
00:02:20,687 --> 00:02:23,507
>> ALL RIGHT.
NOW THIS GETS MY GUNK BECAUSE

36
00:02:23,507 --> 00:02:27,445
THESE TWO ARE GETTING ASRM LOVE TINGLES,

37
00:02:27,445 --> 00:02:33,274
MEANWHILE DOWN IN GEN
POP, THE GRAYS AND I ARE DOING
OUR USUAL DANCE.

38
00:02:33,274 --> 00:02:35,847
THEY'RE BATTING MY KNOCKERS,

39
00:02:35,847 --> 00:02:39,571
THEY'RE STARING DOWN THE BARREL
OF MY SOUTH MOUTH.

40
00:02:39,571 --> 00:02:43,637
BUT I DON'T KNOW THEIR HEART
WASN'T IN IT.

41
00:02:44,578 --> 00:02:48,819
I SAW ONE OF THEM DO THIS LIKE --

42
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:52,390
I'M GOOD.
YOU KNOW, YOU CAN HAVE MY TURN.

43
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:55,574
ANYWAY, THAT'S WHEN TODD HERE
SHOWED UP.

44
00:02:55,945 --> 00:02:58,440
>> TODD, YOU LEFT THE BEINGS
MADE OF LIGHT?

45
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:01,801
>> I DID, SIR.
I GOT LOST ON THE WAY TO THE
BATHROOM.

46
00:03:01,801 --> 00:03:04,825
>> AND HOW DID THEY REACT WHEN
YOU WALKED INTO THE ROOM?

47
00:03:04,825 --> 00:03:09,662
>> LIKE MIDDLE SCHOOLERS MEETING
TAYLOR SWIFT.
THEY JUST MOBBED US.

48
00:03:09,662 --> 00:03:13,116
>> I WONDER WHAT WAS THE CAUSE
OF THE EXCITEMENT.

49
00:03:13,116 --> 00:03:15,425
>> CAN I THROW OUT A THEORY?

50
00:03:15,425 --> 00:03:19,863
THESE THINGS, THEY'RE SMOOTH
DOWN THERE.

51
00:03:20,481 --> 00:03:24,100
THEY'RE LIKE A BROKEN DOORBELL,
YOU KNOW?

52
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:25,455
NO DONG.

53
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:32,014
AND YOU KNOW, I'M WEARING MY
SEE-THROUGH ROBE,

54
00:03:32,014 --> 00:03:37,087
SO WHEN THEY
SAW THAT I WAS PACKING A TROLL NOSE,

55
00:03:38,905 --> 00:03:42,753
MY TROLL NOSE, YOU KNOW,
THEY JUST WENT RIGHT FOR IT.

56
00:03:42,753 --> 00:03:46,880
>> YEAH.
MY GRUMPY AND MY DUMPY WERE OLD NEWS

57
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:50,630
THE MINUTE THEY SAW TODD'S
TROLL NOSE HANGING THERE.

58
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:55,868
>> I'VE NEVER HEARD THE TERM
TROLL NOSE BEFORE.

59
00:03:55,868 --> 00:04:00,529
>> YOU MUST BE HANGING OUT AT A
DIFFERENT BOWLING ALLY THAN WE
DO, SIR.

60
00:04:00,529 --> 00:04:04,398
>> I'LL ASK THAT WE ALL STOP
SAYING TROLL NOSE, PLEASE.

61
00:04:04,398 --> 00:04:07,505
>> DURING THIS OR FOREVER?

62
00:04:07,505 --> 00:04:09,661
>> DURING THIS.

63
00:04:09,661 --> 00:04:13,602
NOW, WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN THE
OTHER AREA OF THE SHIP?

64
00:04:13,602 --> 00:04:17,939
>> OH, THEY SHOWED A SINGLE ATOM
OF SOMETHING CALLED INFINITEM

65
00:04:17,939 --> 00:04:20,848
WHICH CAN POWER THE EARTH FOR
THOUSANDS OF YEARS.

66
00:04:20,848 --> 00:04:23,578
>> YEAH.
CUT TO WHERE I AM.

67
00:04:23,578 --> 00:04:27,768
TODD'S JUNK HAS WHIPPED THE
GRAYS INTO A FRENZY.

68
00:04:27,768 --> 00:04:30,135
THEY GOT HIM STOOD UP LIKE --

69
00:04:30,135 --> 00:04:33,011
WELL, TODD, DO YOU MIND?

70
00:04:36,406 --> 00:04:40,851
SO THEY'RE TAKING TURNS CHECKING
UNDER THE HOOD.

71
00:04:43,983 --> 00:04:47,609
THEY'RE LIKE
THIS REACHING UP,

72
00:04:47,609 --> 00:04:51,226
THEY'RE KIND
OF -- THEY'RE FLICKING IT.

73
00:04:52,131 --> 00:04:58,459
THEY'RE LIKE -- THEY'RE BATTING
AROUND LIKE A CAT.

74
00:04:58,459 --> 00:05:03,654
THEY'RE -- YOU KNOW, THEY'RE
SNIFFING IT.

75
00:05:06,728 --> 00:05:11,383
ONE GUY, HE TRIED TO WEAR IT
LIKE A HAT.

76
00:05:12,153 --> 00:05:16,070
HE HAD IT DRAPED OVER HIS NOSE
LIKE A VIKING HELMET.

77
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:22,132
AND THEN, ONE OF THOSE LUNATICS
GRABBED ON TO THIS THING,

78
00:05:22,132 --> 00:05:24,276
TRIED
TO HOIST HIMSELF UP.

79
00:05:24,276 --> 00:05:27,615
I SAID, CAREFUL, BUDDY.
LAST TIME I PULLED ON ONE THAT HARD,

80
00:05:27,615 --> 00:05:31,631
COP CHANGED HIS MIND AND
DID WRITE ME A TICKET.

81
00:05:38,007 --> 00:05:42,958
>> AND JUST IN CASE YOU'RE
WONDERING, I DID NOT BECOME
AROUSED.

82
00:05:42,958 --> 00:05:46,475
ANY TIME I FELT LIKE I MIGHT, I
JUST LOOKED AT COLLEEN HERE,

83
00:05:46,475 --> 00:05:48,956
AND
IT TOOK CARE OF IT FOR ME.
YOU KNOW?

84
00:05:48,956 --> 00:05:53,264
>> I'VE KILLED MORE CHUBBIES
THAN DIABETES.

85
00:05:53,264 --> 00:05:56,544
>> AND HOW WERE YOU ALL SENT
HOME?

86
00:05:56,544 --> 00:05:59,359
>> I WENT BACK TO THE SMART ALIENS,

87
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:03,377
AND THEY TOUCHED OUR
HEADS TO THEIRS, AND WE WERE
BACK ON EARTH.

88
00:06:03,377 --> 00:06:05,506
>> YEAH.
AND THEY GAVE ME THIS.

89
00:06:05,506 --> 00:06:08,671
THEY WANTED US TO HAVE IT TO
MAKE OUR WORLD BETTER.

90
00:06:08,671 --> 00:06:11,469
>> I ALSO GOT A FAREWELL SOUVENIR

91
00:06:11,469 --> 00:06:16,769
COURTESY OF ONE OF MY
GRAY PALS WHO BITCH SLAPPED ME OUT OF AN OPEN HATCH,

92
00:06:16,769 --> 00:06:21,557
AND THEN I
FALL 30 FEET AND I LAND FACE
DOWN WITH MY WEAN HOLE AND MY BEAN HOLE

93
00:06:21,557 --> 00:06:24,647
POINTED RIGHT AT KIM'S
FACE.

94
00:06:24,647 --> 00:06:28,886
>> KIM WHO?
>> JONG UN.

95
00:06:28,886 --> 00:06:31,391
BASTARDS DROPPED ME IN NORTH
KOREA.

96
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:35,121
BUT, HEY, NOT THE WORST PLACE
I'VE BEEN ON ALL FOURS.

97
00:06:35,121 --> 00:06:36,622

98
00:06:36,622 --> 00:06:41,199

THANK YOU.

103
00:09:20,527 --> 00:09:25,801
IT'S GREAT TO BE BACK HOSTING
SNL.

104
00:09:27,897 --> 00:09:33,353
I'M HERE BECAUSE OF MY NEW
MOVIE, "THE FALL GUY" WITH EMILY
BLUNT!

105
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:40,829
SO DON'T WORRY.
I'M NOT GOING TO MAKE ANY JOKES
ABOUT KEN.

106
00:09:40,829 --> 00:09:43,506
BECAUSE IT'S NOT FUNNY.

107
00:09:43,506 --> 00:09:48,639
KEN AND I, WE HAD TO BREAK UP.

108
00:09:48,835 --> 00:09:53,292
WE WENT TOO DEEP.
AND IT'S OVER.

109
00:09:53,292 --> 00:09:56,272
SO I'M NOT GONNA TALK ABOUT IT.

110
00:09:56,867 --> 00:10:00,900
I ACTUALLY AM GONNA TALK ABOUT
IT A LITTLE BIT.

111
00:10:01,923 --> 00:10:04,202
I HAVE TO.

112

00:31:02,401 --> 00:31:05,997
WHO LOOKS STRIKINGLY
SIMILAR TO BEAVIS

449
00:31:05,997 --> 00:31:08,879
FROM THE
CARTOON BEAVIS AND BUTT-HEAD.

450
00:31:08,879 --> 00:31:10,661
JUST A LITTLE DISTRACTING.

451
00:31:10,661 --> 00:31:13,496
>> I'M NOT FAMILIAR WITH THAT CARTOON,

452
00:31:13,496 --> 00:31:17,314
BUT WOULD IT HELP IF HE
MOVED SEATS?

453
00:31:17,314 --> 00:31:20,444
>> YEAH.
YEAH, THAT MIGHT BE A GOOD IDEA.

454
00:31:20,444 --> 00:31:24,703
IT'S THE GENTLEMAN IN THE BLUE
SHIRT AND BLOND.

455
00:31:28,274 --> 00:31:31,835
>> SIR, DO YOU MIND MOVING?

456
00:31:31,835 --> 00:31:35,736
>> I'M SORRY?
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT ME?

457
00:31:35,736 --> 00:31:39,182
I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT'S GOING ON.
I'M SORRY.
WHAT?

458
00:31:39,265 --> 00:31:41,966
>> YES.
CAN YOU MOVE SEATS?

459
00:31:41,966 --> 00:31:44,254
>> OKAY.
SURE.
I'M SORRY.

460
00:31:44,254 --> 00:31:48,149
I JUST -- I'VE NEVER HEARD OF
THAT CARTOON CHARACTER, SO.

461
00:31:48,539 --> 00:31:53,412
>> AND YOU REALLY NEVER WATCHED
BEAVIS AND BUTT-HEAD WHEN YOU
WERE A TEENAGER?

462
00:31:53,463 --> 00:31:57,842
>> NO.
I WAS PRETTY, SO I WAS GOING TO
PARTIES AND HOOKING UP.

463
00:31:57,934 --> 00:32:01,810
NOW, PROFESSOR, IF AI IS LEFT
UNREGULATED,

464
00:32:01,810 --> 00:32:04,029
WHAT IS YOUR WORST
CASE SCENARIO?

465
00:32:04,029 --> 00:32:07,639
>> WELL, IN SIMPLEST TERMS, IT
BECOMES SO INTELLIGENT

466
00:32:07,639 --> 00:32:11,519
THAT IT
DEEMS HUMANS UNNECESSARY AND
KILLS US ALL.

467
00:32:11,594 --> 00:32:16,113
>> BUT IF HUMAN BEINGS CREATED THE AI,

468
00:32:16,113 --> 00:32:19,260
CAN'T WE JUST PROGRAM IT
TO NOT DO THAT?

469
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:20,719
>> WELL, IT DEPENDS.

470
00:32:20,719 --> 00:32:24,834
OH, MY GOD.
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

471
00:32:24,834 --> 00:32:28,909
>> WHAT?
I THINK THAT'S A VALID QUESTION.

472
00:32:28,909 --> 00:32:32,205
>> NO!
NOW THERE'S A GENTLEMAN BEHIND YOU

473
00:32:32,205 --> 00:32:34,162
THAT LOOKS LIKE BUTT-HEAD.

474
00:32:34,162 --> 00:32:39,386
>> PROFESSOR, JUST BECAUSE OUR
AUDIENCE MEMBERS AREN'T AS
INFORMED ON THE ISSUE AS YOU

475
00:32:39,386 --> 00:32:41,427
DOESN'T MAKE THEM BUTT-HEADS.

476
00:32:41,427 --> 00:32:45,672
>> BUTT-HEAD FROM THE CARTOON.
HE'S BEAVIS' FRIEND.

477
00:32:45,672 --> 00:32:50,677
>> I'D REALLY LIKE TO MOVE ON
AND DISCUSS AI, SO WOULD YOU
LIKE HIM TO MOVE?

478
00:32:50,677 --> 00:32:52,800
>> YES.
THANK YOU.

479
00:32:52,865 --> 00:32:56,372
THE MAN WITH THE GRAY SHIRT AND
EXPOSED GUMS.

480
00:32:56,372 --> 00:32:58,942
>> SIR --

481
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:21,373
KINDLY MOVE SEATS.

482
00:33:24,073 --> 00:33:26,942
>> SHE'S TALKING TO YOU.

483
00:33:26,942 --> 00:33:29,518
>> OH, I'M SORRY.
ME?

484
00:33:29,617 --> 00:33:31,985
>> YES.

485
00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:36,539
>> I'M SO SORRY.
I'M CONFUSED.

486
00:33:36,539 --> 00:33:39,653
I'M JUST HERE TO LEARN ABOUT AI.

487
00:33:42,786 --> 00:33:47,413
>> PROFESSOR, WE HAVE A VIEWER
QUESTION FROM X.

488
00:33:47,413 --> 00:33:51,214
@DANWICH 980 ASKS

489
00:33:51,214 --> 00:33:54,625
DOES CORNHOLIO
NEED TP FOR HIS BUM HOLE?

490
00:33:54,625 --> 00:33:59,608
>> THAT'S SOMETHING TROLLING.
THAT'S A REFERENCE TO THE
CARTOON.

491
00:33:59,608 --> 00:34:02,277
THAT WAS BEAVIS' ALTER EGO.

492
00:34:02,277 --> 00:34:05,022
HE EAT THE SUGAR AND BECOME
CORNHOLIO.

493
00:34:05,022 --> 00:34:10,367
>> I SEE.
LET'S MOVE ON TO OUR AUDIENCE
QUESTIONS STARTING WITH PATRICIA
FAULKNER.

494
00:34:10,367 --> 00:34:12,902
>> YES.
RIGHT HERE.

495
00:34:12,902 --> 00:34:15,685
>> YOU PUT THEM RIGHT NEXT TO
EACH OTHER?

496
00:34:15,685 --> 00:34:19,346
THEY EVEN SITTING LIKE THEY DO
ON THE SHOW.

497
00:34:19,346 --> 00:34:23,405
YOU TWO REALLY DON'T KNOW THAT
YOU LOOK LIKE BEAVIS AND
BUTT-HEAD?

498
00:34:27,317 --> 00:34:33,333
>> I'VE HEARD RUMBLINGS THAT I
LOOK LIKE SOMEONE FROM TV,

499
00:34:33,333 --> 00:34:37,922
BUT
IT'S JUST -- MAYBE IT'S THIS
BEAVIS PERSON.
I DON'T KNOW.

500
00:34:37,922 --> 00:34:41,977
I DON'T WATCH MUCH TELEVISION.
I HAVE AN INCREDIBLY BUSY LIFE.

501
00:34:41,977 --> 00:34:44,657
>> YEAH.
I'M VERY BUSY TOO.

502
00:34:44,657 --> 00:34:49,244
AND THIS IS HONESTLY THE FIRST
TIME I'VE EVER HEARD

503
00:34:49,244 --> 00:34:52,021
THAT I LOOK
LIKE THIS BUTT-HEAD PERSON, SO.

504
00:34:52,021 --> 00:34:55,571
>> OH, BOY.
FOR THOSE JUST TUNING IN,

505
00:34:55,571 --> 00:34:59,921
THIS
IS NEWSNATION, NOT THE CARTOON
NETWORK.

506
00:35:02,399 --> 00:35:07,193
>> HEY, THEY LAUGH LIKE THEM
TOO.
YOU HEAR THAT?

507
00:35:07,193 --> 00:35:09,260
>> MS. FAULKNER, GO AHEAD.

508
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:11,982
>> YES. PROFESSOR,

509
00:35:11,982 --> 00:35:16,009
I'M A SPEECH
THERAPIST, AND I USE AI SOFTWARE
EVERY DAY.

510
00:35:16,009 --> 00:35:19,429
>> YEAH, YEAH, WHATEVER.
HOW LONG Y'ALL BEEN FRIENDS?

511
00:35:19,429 --> 00:35:22,692
>> I DON'T KNOW THIS GENTLEMAN.

512
00:35:22,692 --> 00:35:26,282
>> YOU DON'T KNOW EACH OTHER?
>> NO.

513
00:35:26,282 --> 00:35:29,538
HI, I'M DEAN.

514
00:35:29,538 --> 00:35:32,688
>> JEFF.
NICE TO MEET YOU.
>> NICE TO MEET YOU TOO.

515
00:35:32,688 --> 00:35:35,175
>> ALL RIGHT.
LET'S TAKE A BREAK.

516
00:35:35,175 --> 00:35:39,789
AFTER, WE'LL SPEAK WITH SOME
GENTLEMEN FROM TEXAS WHO LOST
THEIR JOBS TO AI.

517
00:35:39,789 --> 00:35:42,004

MICHAEL CHE.

556
00:41:01,390 --> 00:41:04,264
>>> THANK YOU.
GOOD EVENING, EVERYONE.

557
00:41:04,264 --> 00:41:07,855
>> WELCOME TO "WEEKEND UPDATE."
I'M MICHAEL CHE.
>> I'M COLIN JOST.

558
00:41:09,609 --> 00:41:14,733
THE ARIZONA SUPREME COURT HAS
REINSTATED A LAW FROM 1864

559
00:41:14,733 --> 00:41:17,315
BANNING DOCTORS FROM PERFORMING
ABORTIONS.

560
00:41:17,315 --> 00:41:21,561
NOW, REINSTATING LAWS FROM 1864
ISN'T THE WORST THING FOR ME

561
00:41:21,561 --> 00:41:24,430
BECAUSE I'M A WHITE LAND OWNER.

562
00:41:24,430 --> 00:41:26,455
AND A PROUD FREE MASON.

563
00:41:26,455 --> 00:41:30,791
BUT IT'S PROBABLY NOT GREAT TO
ADOPT HEALTH CARE RULES FROM A TIME

564
00:41:30,791 --> 00:41:35,806
WHERE THE ONLY TWO THINGS
DOCTORS PRESCRIBED WERE PRAYER
AND COCAINE.

565
00:41:35,806 --> 00:41:38,195
SATURDAY AND SUNDAY.

566
00:41:40,144 --> 00:41:42,749
BACK THEN, IF YOU DIDN'T WANT TO
KEEP YOUR BABY,

567
00:41:42,749 --> 00:41:46,443
YOUR ONLY OPTION
WAS TO GIVE IT TO RUMPLE STILL
SKIN.

568
00:41:46,702 --> 00:41:50,513
PRESIDENT BIDEN CRITICIZED THE
ABORTION LAW CALLING IT CRUEL,

569
00:41:50,513 --> 00:41:56,001
WHICH IS
THE SAME THING HE SAID WHEN HE
VOTED AGAINST IT IN 1864.

570
00:41:57,270 --> 00:42:00,817
>> THIS WEEK, DONALD TRUMP SAID
THAT HE SUPPORTS ABORTION LAWS

571
00:42:00,817 --> 00:42:04,015
BEING DECIDED BY THE STATES
INSTEAD OF THE FEDERAL
GOVERNMENT.

572
00:42:04,015 --> 00:42:06,760
BUT WHY STOP THERE?
WHY NOT GO EVEN SMALLER

573
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:09,055
AND
LEAVE IT UP TO THE COUNTY OR THE CITY,

574
00:42:09,055 --> 00:42:12,085
OR EVEN BETTER, TAKE THE
GOVERNMENT OUT OF IT COMPLETELY

575
00:42:12,085 --> 00:42:15,085
AND LEAVE THE CHOICE ABOUT WHAT
WOMEN CAN DO WITH THEIR BODIES

576
00:42:15,085 --> 00:42:17,835
TO THE PERSON WHO KNOWS WHAT
THEY CAN DO WITH THEM THE BEST,

577
00:42:17,835 --> 00:42:20,218
THEIR HUSBANDS.

578
00:42:26,456 --> 00:42:30,277
>> IN A VIDEO ON TRUTH SOCIAL,
DONALD TRUMP FALSELY SAID

579
00:42:30,277 --> 00:42:34,015
THAT
DEMOCRATS SUPPORT ABORTION UP TO
THE NINTH MONTH AND BEYOND.

580
00:42:34,015 --> 00:42:37,699
SAYING, THE BABY IS EXECUTED
AFTER BIRTH.

581
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:41,823
BUT HE ONLY THINKS THAT HAPPENS
BECAUSE WHEN TRUMP WAS A BABY,

582
00:42:41,823 --> 00:42:45,607
A BUNCH OF TIME TRAVELERS SHOWED
UP TRYING TO KILL HIM.

583
00:42:46,370 --> 00:42:50,266
>> O.J. SIMPSON DIED THIS WEEK
AT THE AGE OF 76

584
00:42:50,266 --> 00:42:52,723
AFTER A BATTLE
WITH PROSTATE CANCER

585
00:42:52,723 --> 00:42:56,310
THAT WAS
PLANTED ON HIM BY THE LAPD.

586
00:42:59,207 --> 00:43:04,237
>> THERE WAS ACTUAL LISTEN AN
ERROR IN THE LA TIMES OBITUARY
FOR O.J. SIMPSON

587
00:43:04,237 --> 00:43:06,191
IN THE SECTION
ABOUT HIS PRISON TIME.

588
00:43:06,191 --> 00:43:10,223
INSTEAD OF WRITING OJ WALKED OUT
OF THE LOVE LAW CORRECTIONAL CENTER,

589
00:43:10,223 --> 00:43:14,137
THEY WROTE, TRUMP WALKED
OUT OF THE LOVE LAW CORRECTIONAL CENTER

590
00:43:14,137 --> 00:43:17,172
A FREE MAN FOR THE FIRST
TIME IN NINE YEARS.

591
00:43:17,172 --> 00:43:19,067
IT'S NOT A GREAT SIGN FOR TRUMP

592
00:43:19,067 --> 00:43:22,794
THAT EVEN AUTO CORRECT THINKS HE
BELONGS IN JAIL.

593
00:43:24,167 --> 00:43:27,413
>> PRESIDENT BIDEN MET WITH
JAPAN'S PRIME MINISTER

594
00:43:27,413 --> 00:43:30,452
WHERE
THEY DISCUSSED BUILDING A NEW
BULLET TRAIN SYSTEM IN AMERICA

595
00:43:30,452 --> 00:43:32,611
USING ADVANCED JAPANESE
TECHNOLOGY.

596
00:43:32,611 --> 00:43:35,877
IN RETURN, JAPAN REQUESTED THE
ADVANCED AMERICAN TECHNOLOGY

597
00:43:35,877 --> 00:43:37,965
OF
FORKS.

598
00:43:45,769 --> 00:43:51,018
A NEW REPORT FROM THE WHITE
HOUSE CLAIMS THAT PRESIDENT
BIDEN'S BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF STUDENT LOAN RELIEF

599
00:43:51,018 --> 00:43:53,287
WILL
DISPROPORTIONATELY HELP LATINOS

600
00:43:53,287 --> 00:43:57,845
WHICH HAS EARNED BIDEN THE
NICKNAME EL PAPA DESUGAR.

601
00:43:59,460 --> 00:44:03,739
>> YESTERDAY, MIKE JOHNSON,
WHOSE POSITION AS HOUSE SPEAKER IS IN JEOPARDY

602
00:44:03,739 --> 00:44:06,813
TRAVELED TO
MAR-A-LAGO FOR A MEETING WITH
DONALD TRUMP,

603
00:44:06,813 --> 00:44:09,890
AND BOY IS HIS JAW
TIRED.

604
00:44:19,755 --> 00:44:23,072
THAT EVENTUALLY GOT APPLAUSE?

605
00:44:24,275 --> 00:44:26,732
SENATOR MITCH McCONNELL SEEN HERE

606
00:44:26,732 --> 00:44:30,424
BEING TOLD A BLACK WOMAN
MADE A COUNTRY ALBUM --

607
00:44:35,581 --> 00:44:40,749
HAS COME OUT IN FAVOR OF A BILL
THAT WOULD POTENTIALLY BAN TICK
KNOCK IN THE U.S.

608
00:44:40,749 --> 00:44:42,700
OF COURSE, FOR McCONNELL, TIKTOK

609
00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:46,693
IS JUST WHAT THE GRIM REAPER
SAYS WHILE TAPPING HIS WATCH.

610
00:44:47,954 --> 00:44:52,924
>> THIS WEEK, THE TERM
WEAPONIZED INCOMPETENCE WAS TRENDING ON TIKTOK

611
00:44:52,924 --> 00:44:58,212
AS SOME WOMEN
WERE CALLING OUT THEIR MALE
PARTNERS FOR DOING SIMPLE TASKS
BAD ON PURPOSE

612
00:44:58,212 --> 00:44:59,637
SO THEY NEVER
HAVE TO DO IT AGAIN.

613
00:44:59,637 --> 00:45:03,990
HERE TO COMMENT IS OUR RESIDENT
BOYFRIEND MICHAEL LONGFELLOW.

614
00:45:12,098 --> 00:45:15,371
>> CHE, ALWAYS GOOD TO BE WITH
YOU, MY FRIEND.

615
00:45:15,371 --> 00:45:19,379
>> MICHAEL, HOW YOU DOING?
SO WHAT'S YOUR TAKE ON
WEAPONIZED INCOMPETENCE?

616
00:45:19,379 --> 00:45:21,009
>> WELL, I JUST LEARNED ABOUT IT

617
00:45:21,091 --> 00:45:24,788
BECAUSE MY GIRLFRIEND ASKED ME
TO BUY DISHWASHER SOAP,

618
00:45:24,788 --> 00:45:29,279
AND I
BOUGHT DISH SOAP, WHICH IS
DIFFERENT I GUESS.

619
00:45:29,279 --> 00:45:32,352
SO MY TAKE IS I TOTALLY GET HER POINT,

620
00:45:32,352 --> 00:45:36,333
BUT WHAT I NEED HER TO
UNDERSTAND IS I'M JUST
INCOMPETENT.

621
00:45:36,333 --> 00:45:39,602
AND I'M TRYING REALLY, REALLY
HARD.

622
00:45:39,602 --> 00:45:42,300
AND I LOVE YOU, GIRL.

623
00:45:42,409 --> 00:45:45,721
SO PLEASE, DON'T BE MAD AT ME.

624
00:45:46,554 --> 00:45:50,183
>> DO YOU THINK SHE MIGHT GET
UPSET ABOUT YOU SAYING ANY OF
THIS ON TV?

625
00:45:50,183 --> 00:45:54,949
>> NO.
SHE'LL BE UPSET BECAUSE I WAS
SUPPOSED TO PICK UP OUR CAT FROM
DAY CARE YESTERDAY,

626
00:45:54,949 --> 00:45:57,865
AND I'M
REALIZING AS I SPEAK I TOTALLY
FORGOT.

627
00:45:57,865 --> 00:46:00,834
>> MICHAEL, THAT'S NOT GREAT,
MAN.
>> THAT'S TERRIBLE.

628
00:46:00,834 --> 00:46:04,904
IN THE WORDS OF J. LO, THIS IS
ME.

629
00:46:05,616 --> 00:46:07,818
NOW.

630
00:46:07,818 --> 00:46:12,056
YOU KNOW WHAT?
LET ME JUST TALK TO THE LADIES
DIRECTLY FOR A SECOND.

631
00:46:12,056 --> 00:46:15,112
LET ME GET THE CAMERA.
>> I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD,
MAN.

632
00:46:15,112 --> 00:46:19,095
>> HEY, GIRLS.
IT'S LONGFELLOW.

633
00:46:19,095 --> 00:46:22,478
DON'T GET EXCITED.
IT'S JUST A NAME.

634
00:46:27,310 --> 00:46:28,654
SMALL WEINER JOKE.

635
00:46:28,654 --> 00:46:32,019
>> NO.
WE GOT IT, MAN.
WE GOT IT.
>> JUST A JOKE.

636
00:46:32,110 --> 00:46:36,270
LOOK, LADIES, WHAT ARE WE
FIGHTING ABOUT?

637
00:46:36,270 --> 00:46:38,629
THIS ISN'T US.

638
00:46:38,709 --> 00:46:41,461
YES, MEN SOMETIMES MESS UP TASKS

639
00:46:41,461 --> 00:46:43,310
SO SIMPLE THAT A CHILD COULD DO THEM,

640
00:46:43,310 --> 00:46:45,860
BUT, GIRL, THAT'S
SOCIETY'S FAULT.

641
00:46:45,899 --> 00:46:50,961
THAT'S NOT US BEING WEAPONS.
THE ONLY WEAPONS I OWN, RIGHT
HERE.

642
00:46:51,546 --> 00:46:54,145
AND THEY'RE FOR PROTECTING YOU,
GIRL.

643
00:46:54,145 --> 00:46:57,354
AS LONG AS HE'S SMALLER THAN ME.

644
00:46:57,354 --> 00:46:59,883
SICK IF POSSIBLE.

645
00:46:59,883 --> 00:47:05,249
>> THAT'S YOUR POINT?
>> I FORGOT TO THINK OF ONE.

646
00:47:05,249 --> 00:47:07,933
I KNOW I NEED TO BE BETTER, BUT
HERE'S THE TRUTH.

647
00:47:07,933 --> 00:47:10,779
IF I LIVED ALONE, I WOULD HAVE ONE PLATE,

648
00:47:10,779 --> 00:47:13,604
I WOULD NEVER COOK, I
WOULD ORDER FOOD,

649
00:47:13,678 --> 00:47:16,801
PUT THE
TAKEOUT BOXES ON TOP OF THE TRASH CAN,

650
00:47:16,801 --> 00:47:20,559
AND WHEN THE BOXES
TOUCH THE CEILING, MOVE BACK IN
WITH MY MOM.

651
00:47:20,630 --> 00:47:24,474
THAT'S A GOOD LIFE TO ME.
I'M OKAY LIVING LIKE THAT.

652
00:47:24,474 --> 00:47:27,879
YOU'RE NOT, KATE.

653
00:47:27,879 --> 00:47:32,740
>> YOU JUST SAY YOUR
GIRLFRIEND'S REAL NAME?
>> YEAH.
OOPSY.

654
00:47:32,740 --> 00:47:38,123
LET'S TURN THE TABLES.
LET'S TALK ABOUT WEAPONIZED
COMPETENCE.

655
00:47:38,123 --> 00:47:40,469
>> WEAPONIZED COMPETENCE?
>> YEAH.

656
00:47:40,469 --> 00:47:42,334
WOMEN.

657
00:47:43,177 --> 00:47:45,068
YOU'RE TOO COMPETENT.

658
00:47:45,068 --> 00:47:47,275
WHY DO YOU KNOW HOW TO DO ALL
THIS STUFF?

659
00:47:47,275 --> 00:47:51,218
HOW DO YOU KNOW THE WORD DUVET?
WHO TOLD YOU THAT?

660
00:47:51,218 --> 00:47:55,729
I'VE BEEN LIVING ON THE SAME
EARTH AS YOU, GIRL.
NEVER ONCE HEARD DUVET.

661
00:47:55,729 --> 00:47:58,886
NOW YOU'RE MAD AT ME BECAUSE I
DON'T KNOW HOW TO PUT IT ON?

662
00:47:58,886 --> 00:48:01,801
PUT WHAT ON WHAT?

663
00:48:01,801 --> 00:48:03,477
>> HE'S GOT SOME GOOD POINTS.

664
00:48:03,477 --> 00:48:08,228
MICHAEL LONGFELLOW, EVERYBODY.
>> I'M SO SORRY, BABE!

665
00:48:13,142 --> 00:48:15,965
>> IN A NEW INTERVIEW, BILLY D.
WILLIAMS SAYS

666
00:48:15,965 --> 00:48:18,463
THAT ACTORS SHOULD
BE ALLOWED TO DO BLACK FACE,

667
00:48:18,531 --> 00:48:21,829
ADDING IF YOU'RE AN ACTOR, YOU
SHOULD DO ANYTHING YOU WANT TO
DO.

668
00:48:21,829 --> 00:48:25,180
EXACTLY, SAID KEVIN SPACEY.

669
00:48:26,856 --> 00:48:29,702
>> NEW YORK CITY --

670
00:48:29,702 --> 00:48:32,887
>> THEY LIKES IT.
>> NO, THEY DIDN'T LIKE IT.

671
00:48:32,887 --> 00:48:36,264
NEW YORK CITY OFFICIALS ARE
CONSIDERING CONTROLLING

672
00:48:36,264 --> 00:48:39,746
THE
CITY'S RAPID GROWING POPULATION
BY USING BIRTH PELLETS,

673
00:48:39,746 --> 00:48:45,093
WHICH
WILL FINALLY LET FEMALE RATS
FOCUS ON THEIR CAREERS.

674
00:48:49,845 --> 00:48:53,387
>> THE TSA REPORTS IN THE FIRST
THREE MONTHS OF THIS YEAR,

675
00:48:53,387 --> 00:48:58,007
THEY
HAVE INTERCEPTED 1,500 GUNS IN
CARRY-ON BAGS,

676
00:48:58,007 --> 00:49:00,085
AND THE MAJORITY
OF THEM WERE LOADED,

677
00:49:00,085 --> 00:49:03,978
'CUZ YOU'RE
GIVING ME THAT WINDOW SEAT.

678
00:49:08,004 --> 00:49:10,650
>> YOU ARE A STUPID MAN.

679
00:49:10,650 --> 00:49:14,831
72-YEAR-OLD JERRY TURNER FROM
THE GOLDEN BACHELOR ANNOUNCED

680
00:49:14,832 --> 00:49:19,456
THAT HE AND HIS 70-YEAR-OLD WIFE
ARE DIVORCING AFTER THREE MONTHS
OF MARRIAGE.

681
00:49:19,456 --> 00:49:22,279
BUT LIKE THEY SAY, THERE'S STILL
PLENTY OF FISH IN THE SEA --

682
00:49:22,279 --> 00:49:24,002
METARY.

683
00:49:27,155 --> 00:49:31,881
SEAMETARY, COLIN.
>> REALLY GOOD.

684
00:49:31,881 --> 00:49:37,289
IT WAS ANNOUNCED THAT A MUSICAL
VERSION OF LORD OF THE RINGS
WILL OPEN IN CHICAGO,

685
00:49:37,289 --> 00:49:40,701
SO IF YOU
LOVE MUSICALS AND YOU LOVE LORD
OF THE RINGS,

686
00:49:40,701 --> 00:49:43,431
HIGH SCHOOL MUST
HAVE BEEN A TOUGH TIME.

687
00:49:45,828 --> 00:49:49,082
TRUST ME, I KNOW.

688
00:49:54,479 --> 00:49:58,745
>> THE UNIVERSITY OF IOWA
ANNOUNCED THAT BASKETBALL STAR
CAITLIN CLARK

689
00:49:58,745 --> 00:50:00,630
WILL HAVE HER
JERSEY RETIRED.

690
00:50:00,630 --> 00:50:03,597
AND REPLACED WITH AN APRON.

691
00:50:07,129 --> 00:50:12,672
WELL, THE WNBA DRAFT IS THIS
MONDAY,

692
00:50:12,672 --> 00:50:16,235
AND IOWA STAR CAITLIN
CLARK IS EXPECTED TO BE THE
NUMBER ONE PICK.

693
00:50:16,235 --> 00:50:19,595
HERE TO COMMENT IS CAITLIN
CLARK.

694
00:50:37,574 --> 00:50:40,799
ME

695
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:43,501
>> BUT NOTHING FOR MY JOKE?
WHATEVER.

696
00:50:43,501 --> 00:50:46,454
I AM A FAN, CAITLIN, BY THE WAY.

697
00:50:46,454 --> 00:50:49,760
>> REALLY, MICHAEL?
BECAUSE I HEARD THAT LITTLE
APRON JOKE YOU DID.

698
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:52,210
>> YEAH.
IT WAS A JOKE.
WE'RE JUST HAVING FUN.
YOU KNOW?

699
00:50:52,273 --> 00:50:55,436
>> YOU MAKE A LOT OF JOKES ABOUT
WOMEN'S SPORTS.
DON'T YOU, MICHAEL?

700
00:50:55,436 --> 00:50:58,601
>> I WOULDN'T SAY A LOT.
IT'S NOT ON THE REGULAR.

701
00:50:58,601 --> 00:51:01,060
>> IT'S DEFINITELY A LOT.

702
00:51:01,060 --> 00:51:03,883
I ACTUALLY SORT OF MADE A SUPER
CUT.
TAKE A LOOK.

703
00:51:03,883 --> 00:51:04,759
>> WELL, NO, WE DON'T HAVE TO --

704
00:51:04,759 --> 00:51:08,019
A NUMBER OF SPORTS BARS AROUND
THE COUNTRY ARE PROMISING

705
00:51:08,019 --> 00:51:11,435
TO ONLY SHOW WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
GAMES DURING MARCH MADNESS.

706
00:51:11,435 --> 00:51:15,450
THE BARS ARE KNOWN COLLECTIVELY
AS THE EMPTY ONES.

707
00:51:15,523 --> 00:51:20,644
A NEW REPORT CLAIMS THAT RECENT
STORIES ON THE SPORTS ILLUSTRATED WEBSITE

708
00:51:20,644 --> 00:51:22,758
WERE
ACTUALLY GENERATED BY AI,

709
00:51:22,758 --> 00:51:25,407
AND
IT'S ALREADY MAKING GLARING
MISTAKES, FOR INSTANCE,

710
00:51:25,407 --> 00:51:29,006
IT MADE
UP SOMETHING CALLED THE WNBA?

711
00:51:29,364 --> 00:51:32,560
IOWA'S FINAL FOUR GAME AGAINST
UCONN

712
00:51:32,560 --> 00:51:35,928
WAS THE MOST WATCHED
WOMEN'S COLLEGE BASKETBALL GAME EVER

713
00:51:35,928 --> 00:51:38,844
WITH 14.2 MILLION VIEWERS,

714
00:51:38,844 --> 00:51:43,968
BEATING THE PREVIOUS RECORD BY
14.2 MILLION VIEWERS.

715
00:51:44,464 --> 00:51:47,510
>> WOW.
COLIN WITH THE RECEIPTS.
THANKS, MAN.

716
00:51:47,510 --> 00:51:51,374
>> NO PROBLEM.
UNLIKE CHE, I SUPPORT WOMEN.

717
00:51:52,686 --> 00:51:55,724
>> HOLD ON.
I THINK YOU'RE A GREAT
BASKETBALL PLAYER.

718
00:51:55,724 --> 00:51:57,049
I CAN'T PLAY LIKE YOU DO.

719
00:51:57,049 --> 00:52:00,402
>> YEAH.
WE KNOW.
OBVIOUSLY, I CAN'T TELL JOKES
LIKE YOU DO.

720
00:52:00,402 --> 00:52:01,811
>> THANK YOU FOR THAT.

721
00:52:01,811 --> 00:52:05,861
>> BUT I DID WRITE SOME JOKES.
IT WOULD MEAN A LOT TO ME IF YOU
READ SOME OF THEM.

722
00:52:05,861 --> 00:52:07,088
JUST RIGHT OVER THERE ON THE
CARDS.

723
00:52:07,088 --> 00:52:08,830
>> WELL --

724
00:52:15,118 --> 00:52:19,734
THE INDIANA FEVER
HAVE THE FIRST PICK IN THIS
MONDAY'S DRAFT,

725
00:52:19,734 --> 00:52:23,376
A REMINDER THAT
INDIANA FEVER IS A WNBA TEAM

726
00:52:23,376 --> 00:52:27,916
AND
NOT WHAT MICHAEL CHE GAVE TO
DOZENS OF WOMEN AT PURDUE
UNIVERSITY.

727
00:52:28,721 --> 00:52:33,274
>> SEE?
THAT'S A GOOD JOKE ABOUT WOMEN'S
SPORTS.

728
00:52:33,375 --> 00:52:35,465
TRY ANOTHER ONE.

729
00:52:36,472 --> 00:52:38,826
>> YOU REALLY WROTE THESE
YOURSELF?
>> YEAH.

730
00:52:38,826 --> 00:52:41,699
>> NETFLIX TOP SHOW IS RIPLY

731
00:52:41,699 --> 00:52:45,891
FEATURING AN EERIE UNSETTLING
PERFORMANCE BY ACTOR ANDREW
SCOTT.

732
00:52:45,891 --> 00:52:48,414
CRITICS SAY IT'S THE HARDEST
THING TO WATCH ON NETFLIX

733
00:52:48,414 --> 00:52:51,958
SINCE
MICHAEL CHE'S SPECIAL SHAME THE
DEVIL.

734
00:52:53,653 --> 00:52:57,277
>> I LIKE THAT ONE.
THERE'S MORE.

735
00:52:58,171 --> 00:53:00,734
>> THIS YEAR, CAITLIN CLARK

736
00:53:00,734 --> 00:53:04,562
BROKE THE RECORD FOR
THREE-POINTERS IN A SINGLE SEASON,

737
00:53:04,562 --> 00:53:07,087
AND I HAVE THREE

741
00:53:19,129 --> 00:53:20,475

NO PROBLEM.

742
00:53:20,475 --> 00:53:24,699
AND GOOD LUCK IN THE WNBA.
I HOPE YOU HAVE A GREAT FIRST
SEASON.

743
00:53:24,699 --> 00:53:27,004
>> THANKS.
I'M SURE IT WILL BE A BIG FIRST STEP FOR ME,

744
00:53:27,004 --> 00:53:29,345
BUT IT'S JUST ONE STEP FOR THE WNBA

745
00:53:29,345 --> 00:53:32,621
THANKS TO ALL THE GREAT PLAYERS,

00:53:35,229 --> 00:53:37,153
AND MY BASKETBALL HERO,
MAYA MOORE.

748
00:53:37,252 --> 00:53:40,503
THESE ARE THE GIRLS THAT KICKED
DOWN THE DOOR SO I COULD WALK
INSIDE.

749
00:53:40,503 --> 00:53:42,872
I WANT TO THANK THEM FOR LAYING
DOWN THE FOUNDATION.

750
00:53:42,872 --> 00:53:46,836
MICHAEL, SINCE YOU'RE SUCH A BIG
FAN, I BROUGHT YOU A SOUVENIR.

751
00:53:46,836 --> 00:53:50,148
IT'S AN APRON SIGNED BY ME.

752
00:53:57,388 --> 00:54:00,731
>> THANK YOU.
I CAN'T WAIT TO GIVE THIS TO MY
GIRLFRIEND.

753
00:54:00,731 --> 00:54:03,545
>> YOU DON'T HAVE A GIRLFRIEND,
MICHAEL.
>> ALL RIGHT.

754
00:54:04,505 --> 00:54:07,441
CAITLIN CLARK, EVERYBODY.

755
00:54:08,143 --> 00:54:12,585
FOR

756
00:54:33,950 --> 00:54:37,482
HATE HOSPITALS

757
00:54:37,482 --> 00:54:40,610
>> I CAN'T BELIEVE HE'S BEEN IN
SURGERY FOR 12 HOURS.

758
00:54:40,610 --> 00:54:43,245
>> THANK YOU ALL FOR WAITING.
THE DOCTOR WILL SEE YOU NOW.

759
00:54:43,245 --> 00:54:46,453
>> HELLO, FAMILY.

760
00:54:46,453 --> 00:54:49,579
WELL, THIS IS NEVER EASY TO SAY.

761
00:54:49,579 --> 00:54:53,075
WE DID EVERYTHING WE COULD, BUT
HE DID NOT MAKE IT.

762
00:54:53,075 --> 00:54:56,909
>> OH, MY GOD.
>> IT'S OKAY, GUYS.
HE LIVED A LONG LIFE.

763
00:54:56,909 --> 00:55:02,045
>> IF IT'S ANY COMFORT, IT'S NOT
MY FAULT.

764
00:55:02,045 --> 00:55:05,749
>> OKAY.
YEAH.
WE DIDN'T THINK IT WAS ANYONE'S
FAULT.

765
00:55:05,749 --> 00:55:09,349
>> MM, SO WE AGREE.
IT'S NOT MY FAULT.

766
00:55:09,349 --> 00:55:12,302
COULD EACH OF YOU SAY THAT ONE
AT A TIME, PLEASE?

767
00:55:12,380 --> 00:55:14,552
>> DO NOT RECORD US RIGHT NOW.

768
00:55:14,552 --> 00:55:17,463
>> DOCTOR, CAN WE PLEASE HAVE A
MOMENT TO PROCESS THIS?

769
00:55:17,463 --> 00:55:20,257
>> OKAY.

770
00:55:21,390 --> 00:55:24,679
>> WELL, MAYBE WE SHOULD ALL GO
AROUND AND SAY SOMETHING WE
LOVED ABOUT GRANDPA.

771
00:55:24,679 --> 00:55:26,222
>> I THINK THAT WOULD BE NICE.

772
00:55:26,222 --> 00:55:29,324
>> I LOVE THE WAY THAT HE
SMELLED.

773
00:55:29,324 --> 00:55:33,270
>> HELLO, AGAIN.
THIS IS MY ASSOCIATE.

774
00:55:33,270 --> 00:55:36,229
HE WAS IN THE OPERATING ROOM
WITH ME.

775
00:55:36,229 --> 00:55:38,283
HE HAS SOMETHING HE WANTS TO
TELL YOU.

776
00:55:38,283 --> 00:55:41,252
>> I'M SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS.

777
00:55:41,252 --> 00:55:47,528
>> AND?
>> I DIDN'T DROP ANYTHING IN
ANYTHING.

778
00:55:47,528 --> 00:55:50,348
>> SEE, NOW THAT MAKES IT SEEM
LIKE YOU DID.

779
00:55:50,348 --> 00:55:54,504
>> NO, I DIDN'T.
HE WAS VERY OLD, VERY SICK,

780
00:55:54,504 --> 00:55:57,684
AND
THERE WAS ALREADY AN AIRPOD
INSIDE OF HIM.

781
00:55:57,684 --> 00:56:00,805
>> OKAY.
YOU KNOW WHAT, MAYBE WE SHOULD
GET OUT OF THIS WAITING ROOM.

782
00:56:00,805 --> 00:56:03,105
>> YEAH.
COME ON, KIDS, LET'S GO TO THE
CAFETERIA.

783
00:56:03,105 --> 00:56:04,838
>> OH, ARE YOU HUNGRY?

784
00:56:04,838 --> 00:56:08,252
WOULD YOU LIKE TO TRY SOME
COOKIE CRUMBLES?

785
00:56:08,252 --> 00:56:12,654
>> WHAT ARE COOKIE CRUMBLES?
>> THEY'RE MY OWN CREATION.

786
00:56:12,654 --> 00:56:16,490
SOMETIMES YOU DON'T WANT A WHOLE
COOKIE, YOU JUST WANT A BITE.

787
00:56:16,490 --> 00:56:19,706
>> DID YOU HAVE THAT ON YOU
DURING THE SURGERY?

788
00:56:19,706 --> 00:56:23,274
>> WE HAD A FEW SPOONFULS, YES.

789
00:56:23,274 --> 00:56:27,143
THAT'S HOW YOU EAT THEM, WITH A
LITTLE RED SPOON.

790
00:56:27,143 --> 00:56:29,362
IT WOULD COME WITH IT.

791
00:56:29,362 --> 00:56:32,323
>> UM, ARE YOU LIKE SELLING
THESE?

792
00:56:32,323 --> 00:56:35,450
>> THE COOKIE CRUMBLES OR THE
SPOON?

793
00:56:35,450 --> 00:56:39,567
EITHER WAY, NOT YET BUT SOON.

794
00:56:39,567 --> 00:56:43,312
>> SO, IT'S JUST CRUMBS OF
COOKIES?

795
00:56:43,312 --> 00:56:47,094
>> IT'S COOKIE CRUMBLES.
WHAT DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND?

796
00:56:47,094 --> 00:56:50,268
FOR WHEN YOU WANT A COOKIE, BUT
YOU DON'T WANT THE WHOLE THING.

797
00:56:50,268 --> 00:56:52,600
I DIDN'T KILL HIM.

798
00:56:54,324 --> 00:57:00,129
>> THE SLOGAN IS THAT'S THE WAY
THE COOKIE FALLS APART INTO
LITTLE PIECES.

799
00:57:00,129 --> 00:57:03,517
>> WHY NOT JUST THAT'S THE WAY
THE COOKIE CRUMBLES?

800
00:57:03,614 --> 00:57:05,881
>> WE'RE NOT TAKING ANY PITCHES.

801
00:57:05,881 --> 00:57:07,403
>> DOCTOR, PLEASE --

802
00:57:07,403 --> 00:57:09,793
>> HOW DID YOU KNOW MY LAST
NAME?

803
00:57:09,793 --> 00:57:12,543
>> YOUR LAST NAME IS PLEASE?

804
00:57:12,543 --> 00:57:17,476
>> YES.
HE'S DR. PLEASE, AND I'M JEFFREY
THANK YOU.

805
00:57:17,476 --> 00:57:21,086
>> LOOK.
WE'RE TRYING TO GRIEVE.
MY FATHER IS GONE.

806
00:57:21,086 --> 00:57:23,415
>> WE CAN'T BRING HIM BACK.

807
00:57:23,415 --> 00:57:26,747
>> YEAH.
WE KNOW THAT OBVIOUSLY.

808
00:57:26,747 --> 00:57:30,483
>> UNLESS YOU THINK MAYBE WE
COULD.
NO.

809
00:57:30,483 --> 00:57:32,624
>> IT'S NOT SOMETHING WE CAN DO,

810
00:57:32,735 --> 00:57:37,365
UNLESS YOU THINK WE SHOULD TRY.
>> NO.

811
00:57:37,365 --> 00:57:41,654
>> LOOK, WE NEED TO MAKE A FEW
CALLS AND ARRANGEMENTS.
CAN WE PLEASE HAVE SOME PRIVACY?

812
00:57:41,654 --> 00:57:44,978
>> OKAY.
>> OKAY.

813
00:57:45,239 --> 00:57:49,480
WHAT IS UP WITH THESE GUYS?
I'M KIND OF CREEPED OUT.

814
00:57:49,480 --> 00:57:50,676
>> DO THEY EVEN WORK HERE?

815
00:57:50,676 --> 00:57:54,765
>> I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU GUYS,
BUT I FEEL LIKE THEY DEFINITELY
KILLED GRANDPA.

816
00:57:54,765 --> 00:57:58,570
>> DON'T TALK TOO LOUD.
THEY'RE RIGHT THERE.

817
00:58:07,155 --> 00:58:09,375
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

818
00:58:11,890 --> 00:58:15,792
>> YOU KNOW, WE COULD ALSO CALL
THEM COOKIE CROUTONS.

819
00:58:15,792 --> 00:58:18,829
>> ONE COULD MIX THEM INTO A
DESERT SALAD.

820
00:58:18,829 --> 00:58:21,225
JUST

821
00:58:21,225 --> 00:58:25,813
>> THAT'S BRILLIANT.
THE DRESSING COULD BE CHOCOLATE
SYRUP OR --

822
00:58:25,813 --> 00:58:28,280
ICE CREAM.

823
00:58:28,280 --> 00:58:31,492
>> STOP TALKING ABOUT THE COOKIE
CRUMBLES.

824
00:58:31,492 --> 00:58:32,876
>> WE'RE SORRY.

825
00:58:32,876 --> 00:58:37,369
>> WE HAVE ONE MORE THING TO
SAY, AND WE HOPE THIS GIVES YOU
THE CLOSURE YOU NEED.

826
00:58:37,369 --> 00:58:38,939
>> WHAT IS IT?

827
00:58:38,939 --> 00:58:41,677
>> WE ARE DATING NOW.

828
00:58:41,677 --> 00:58:44,711
>> BEEP, BEEP.
HERE HE IS.

829
00:58:44,711 --> 00:58:49,030
>> IS THAT MY FAMILY?
I'M STILL FEELING A LITTLE
WOOZY.

830
00:58:49,030 --> 00:58:50,314
>> DAD, YOU'RE ALIVE?

831
00:58:50,314 --> 00:58:54,617
>> WAIT, THIS IS YOUR FATHER?
>> WE HAVE THE WRONG FAMILY.

832
00:58:54,617 --> 00:58:58,609
>> WE HEARD EVERYTHING YOU SAID.
>> WHAT DID YOU DO TO OUR
FATHER?

833
00:58:58,609 --> 00:59:01,808
>> IT'S NOT OUR FAULT.
>> WOULD YOU LIKE SOME COOKIE
CRUMBLES?

834
00:59:26,171 --> 00:59:29,746
ONCE AGAIN

TIMES I'LL BE HEARING FROM YOU,
GEORGE.

887
01:04:57,355 --> 01:05:01,213
SO GOOD NIGHT.
MAYBE YOU CAN WRITE ME A LETTER
SOMETIME.

888
01:05:01,213 --> 01:05:03,099
>> LETTER?

889
01:05:03,575 --> 01:05:06,217
HERE'S A LETTER FOR YOU.

890
01:05:06,409 --> 01:05:09,029
Y,

891
01:05:09,147 --> 01:05:13,616
THE THING I ASK MY WIFE AND
MY DAD WHEN HE LEFT.

892
01:05:13,616 --> 01:05:18,398
U, THE ANSWER MY MAMA GAVE ME.

893
01:05:18,398 --> 01:05:23,729
K, WHAT MY DAD TEXT BACK AFTER I
SAY I LOVE HIM.

894
01:05:23,729 --> 01:05:28,071
J, WHAT I SMOKE TO FORGET MY
ROTTEN PAST.

895
01:05:28,071 --> 01:05:32,700
AND O, THE THING I HAVE NEVER
GIVEN A WOMAN.

896
01:05:34,974 --> 01:05:39,688
SO, YEAH, MAYBE NEXT TIME DON'T
JUDGE A BOOK BY ITS COVER.

897
01:05:39,688 --> 01:05:43,761
>> BOOK?
DID YOU SAY BOOK?

898
01:05:43,761 --> 01:05:49,256
LITTLE WOMEN, THAT'S WHAT I CALL
MY 30 DAUGHTERS.

899
01:05:49,256 --> 01:05:50,679
>> I THOUGHT YOU HAD TWO.

900
01:05:50,679 --> 01:05:53,274
>> FAHRENHEIT 451,

901
01:05:53,362 --> 01:05:57,963
WHAT I PUT THE OVEN AT TO MAKE THEM THEIR
SAD GRAY MEATLOAF.

902
01:05:57,963 --> 01:06:01,377
EXTREMELY LOUD AND INCREDIBLY CLOSE,

903
01:06:01,377 --> 01:06:04,050
THAT'S HOW I LIKE TO DO
IT.

904
01:06:04,050 --> 01:06:08,948
>> WOW.
>> YEAH.
YOU COULDN'T HANDLE MY LIFE,
GEORGE.
TRUST ME.

905
01:06:09,029 --> 01:06:10,787
WE'RE BETTER OFF BEING FRIENDS.

906
01:06:10,787 --> 01:06:15,055
>> FRIENDS?
YOU SAY FRIENDS?

907
01:06:15,055 --> 01:06:17,824
WELL, I KNOW SOME FRIENDS.

908
01:06:18,013 --> 01:06:20,311
CHANDLER,

909
01:06:21,248 --> 01:06:26,276
RACHEL, JOEY, ROSS,

910
01:06:26,276 --> 01:06:30,560
MONICA, PHOEBE, AND CENTRAL
PERK.

911
01:06:30,560 --> 01:06:35,354
NOT A PERSON, BUT UNDENIABLY A
CHARACTER IN THAT SHOW.

912
01:06:35,354 --> 01:06:38,798
>> WILL Y'ALL PLEASE SHUT UP?

913
01:06:38,798 --> 01:06:41,608
I LIVE ACROSS THE STREET AND I
CAN'T GET A WINK OF SLEEP.

914
01:06:41,608 --> 01:06:44,812
>> SORRY ABOUT THAT.
WE DIDN'T MEAN TO MAKE SO MUCH
NOISE.

915
01:06:44,812 --> 01:06:48,304
>> NOISE?
DID YOU SAY NOISE?

916
01:06:48,304 --> 01:06:50,782
I KNOW A COUPLE NOISES.

917
01:06:50,782 --> 01:06:52,975
BEEP BEEP,

918
01:06:53,895 --> 01:06:57,809
THAT'S THE SOUND OF
MY EX-WIFE'S CAR PARKED OUTSIDE
MY HOUSE.

919
01:06:57,809 --> 01:07:00,522
HA-HA-HA,

920
01:07:00,522 --> 01:07:03,244
THAT'S THE SOUND OF CHILDREN LAUGHING AT ME

921
01:07:03,244 --> 01:07:05,677
WHEN I TRY TO LEARN HOW TO SKATEBOARD.

922
01:07:05,677 --> 01:07:08,259
WEE, WEE, WEE,

923
01:07:08,259 --> 01:07:11,180
THAT'S THE SOUND
OF BATS FLYING AROUND MY ATTIC.

924
01:07:11,180 --> 01:07:13,741
POW!

925
01:07:13,741 --> 01:07:16,191
THAT'S ME DOING KARATE ON THE
BATS.

926
01:07:16,191 --> 01:07:18,650
HOW'S THAT FOR SOUND?

927
01:07:19,986 --> 01:07:24,115
>> IT'S GOOD.
IT'S REALLY GOOD.

928
01:07:24,115 --> 01:07:28,593
>> BUT YOU'VE CONVINCED ME I'D
LOVE TO GET THAT DINNER.

929
01:07:28,593 --> 01:07:31,861
>> GREAT.
CAN I HAVE YOUR NUMBER?

930
01:07:31,861 --> 01:07:32,986
>> NUMBER?

931
01:07:32,986 --> 01:07:35,190
>> NO.

932
01:07:35,190 --> 01:07:37,446
WE ARE NOT DOING THIS AGAIN.

933
01:08:14,944 --> 01:08:18,341
STAMPL

934
01:08:18,341 --> 01:08:20,147
MORGANE

935
01:08:20,147 --> 01:08:23,027
McKINNON!

936
01:08:23,027 --> 01:08:25,655
EMILY BLUNT,

937
01:08:25,655 --> 01:08:28,618
AND CAITLIN CLARK!

938
01:08:29,218 --> 01:08:32,349
EVA, I LOVE YOU.

939
01:08:32,349 --> 01:08:35,259
THE BEST CREW IN THE WORLD.

940
01:08:35,259 --> 01:08:38,820
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
HAVE A WONDERFUL NIGHT.

941
01:08:38,820 --> 01:08:41,036
AND THE CAST!
