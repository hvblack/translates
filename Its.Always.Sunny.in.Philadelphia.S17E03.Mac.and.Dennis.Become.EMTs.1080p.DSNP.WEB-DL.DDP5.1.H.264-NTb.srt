1
00:00:07,883 --> 00:00:09,926
<i>Don't think this guy's
gonna make it. You hear me?</i>

2
00:00:09,927 --> 00:00:11,135
<i>Did you have an OPA.</i>

3
00:00:11,136 --> 00:00:12,637
<i>I did.
Breathing's irregular and weak.</i>

4
00:00:12,638 --> 00:00:14,222
- Responsive to pain?
- Not at all.

5
00:00:14,223 --> 00:00:16,224
Sir, can you hear me?
His lips are super red.

6
00:00:16,225 --> 00:00:17,308
Purple cyanosis.

7
00:00:17,309 --> 00:00:19,227
- Super diaphoretic.
- Sweating like a pig.

8
00:00:19,228 --> 00:00:20,311
What happened to this guy?

9
00:00:20,312 --> 00:00:21,562
We don't know this guy from Adam.

10
00:00:21,563 --> 00:00:24,690
We've never seen him before at all.
He's a total outsider.

11
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:26,651
I never saw him before in the bar at all.

12
00:00:26,652 --> 00:00:29,779
His goddamn heart just stopped
for no reason.

13
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:31,906
Not no reason. You gave him a hot pepper.

14
00:00:31,907 --> 00:00:33,241
Don't... They don't have to know that.

15
00:00:33,242 --> 00:00:35,368
- Never mind that!
- It was a totally unrelated incident.

16
00:00:35,369 --> 00:00:37,245
- Never mind that.
- Who was that guy anyway?

17
00:00:37,246 --> 00:00:39,789
Man, just like some random dude
who walked in here off the streets.

18
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:41,791
Well, we are an open bar.

19
00:00:41,792 --> 00:00:43,543
I thought he was, like, a jazzman.

20
00:00:43,544 --> 00:00:47,046
I mean, he had a ponytail.
He had a piano-key tie.

21
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:48,923
So I pranked him with a ghost pepper.

22
00:00:48,924 --> 00:00:51,634
You'd think that a jazzman would be
more accustomed to spices, you know?

23
00:00:51,635 --> 00:00:53,636
- Right? You'd think he'd be fine.
- Yeah, he just dropped...

24
00:00:53,637 --> 00:00:55,680
- Here you go, Frank. One smash burger.
- Oh.

25
00:00:55,681 --> 00:00:56,806
It's about time.

26
00:00:56,807 --> 00:00:58,557
Okay.

27
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:00,268
Oh. Somebody dying or something?

28
00:01:00,269 --> 00:01:01,852
Random jazzman.

29
00:01:01,853 --> 00:01:05,398
Really? Just wandered right in
off the streets? No reason?

30
00:01:05,399 --> 00:01:07,942
We are an open, working bar.

31
00:01:07,943 --> 00:01:09,902
Sorry. Wh-What's with
the food delivery here?

32
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:12,697
Oh. I'm, uh, doing a Postmates thing
as a side gig.

33
00:01:12,698 --> 00:01:14,782
- On a bike?
- Uh. No, no.

34
00:01:14,783 --> 00:01:18,911
Yeah, no, sorry, uh. I mean,
why are you ordering food from Dee, Frank?

35
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:21,247
You don't like the burgers
that I've been making in the apartment?

36
00:01:21,248 --> 00:01:23,791
What? I wanted a smash burger.

37
00:01:23,792 --> 00:01:26,711
You don't think I can make a burger
and smash it? I'll smash a burger for you.

38
00:01:26,712 --> 00:01:28,713
What the hell, Frank? A 5% tip?

39
00:01:28,714 --> 00:01:31,258
Pedal faster. It's cold as shit.

40
00:01:31,883 --> 00:01:32,883
Goddamn it.

41
00:01:32,884 --> 00:01:35,511
They're taking him to the hospital.
Good job, guys! Good luck!

42
00:01:35,512 --> 00:01:38,222
Yes, great work, fellas.
Thank you for your service.

43
00:01:38,223 --> 00:01:40,766
- That guy's gonna sue the shit out of me.
- Yeah, that's not good, man.

44
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:44,437
Hey, did anybody else get, like,
a crazy rush from that experience?

45
00:01:44,438 --> 00:01:45,521
I did.

46
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:48,065
It's nice to have
a little action around here, right?

47
00:01:48,066 --> 00:01:51,235
The way those EMTs, like, fire in
and they fire out with all the lights

48
00:01:51,236 --> 00:01:53,237
- and the sirens, saving lives.
- It's awesome.

49
00:01:53,238 --> 00:01:55,573
You know, it's as close
to playing God as you can get, you know?

50
00:01:55,574 --> 00:01:57,867
And the lifestyle.
There's an appeal to it for sure.

51
00:01:57,868 --> 00:02:01,662
The lifestyle. Yeah, the whole thing
is a vibe, and I am here for it.

52
00:02:01,663 --> 00:02:03,789
- Me too. It's sexy.
- Yeah, sexy.

53
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,791
You know that they bang the doctors
and the nurses, right?

54
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:08,711
Of course they do. Of course they do.
Are you kidding me?

55
00:02:08,712 --> 00:02:11,505
The lifestyle is spicier
than one of Frank's ghost peppers.

56
00:02:11,506 --> 00:02:12,799
Mac, come here for a second.

57
00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:16,511
Go with me here,
but, uh, I'm sensing an opportunity,

58
00:02:17,095 --> 00:02:22,516
and I'm gonna float something by you that
I think is a very reasonable proposition.

59
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:26,735
EMT

60
00:02:48,543 --> 00:02:50,045
{\an8}Oh, shit, pal.

61
00:02:54,257 --> 00:02:55,717
{\an8}You're not cake, are you?

62
00:02:56,343 --> 00:02:59,428
{\an8}Nah. It's just a joke between me
and the guys...

63
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:01,764
Uh... Something.

64
00:03:01,765 --> 00:03:04,975
Anyway, I came over here to say
I'm sorry because...

65
00:03:04,976 --> 00:03:07,395
Well, y-you know,
actually, it's not my fault.

66
00:03:07,396 --> 00:03:10,439
Well, sure, I gave you a hot pepper
and you had a heart attack,

67
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,858
but, you know,
I-I kind of attribute that to the...

68
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:17,447
you know, the jazzman lifestyle
more than the pepper.

69
00:03:19,408 --> 00:03:23,912
Eh? Just checking about the cake thing.
You never know with those guys.

70
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:27,289
Well, well, well.

71
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:30,042
The Lawyer. What's with the getup?

72
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:32,087
It's not a getup.

73
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:36,549
It's an eye patch from
when I was attacked by a bird.

74
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:38,884
Gruesome. I wish I'd have seen that.

75
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:40,345
You did see it.

76
00:03:41,388 --> 00:03:42,388
I don't remember.

77
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:45,933
You don't remember
being present in a court of law

78
00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:49,938
while a wild animal
pecked out someone's eye?

79
00:03:50,689 --> 00:03:52,106
Can you be more specific?

80
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,068
I'll be more specific, Frank.

81
00:03:55,777 --> 00:03:59,822
I'm here looking for clients,
and I just found one.

82
00:03:59,823 --> 00:04:02,491
You just admitted
to causing this man grievous harm,

83
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:06,078
and I am going to take you down.

84
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:08,330
- I'm innocent.
- You literally just admitted it.

85
00:04:08,331 --> 00:04:10,959
- I was lying.
- To a man in a coma?

86
00:04:11,543 --> 00:04:13,044
- I thought he was cake.
- Okay.

87
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:15,338
I'll see you in court, Frank.

88
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:17,966
Shit.

89
00:04:19,551 --> 00:04:22,344
This is great, buddy. Frankly,
I think we should've done it years ago.

90
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:24,513
Agreed. This is the perfect complement

91
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:26,265
- to our fast-paced lifestyle.
- I think so too.

92
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:29,226
Plus, I really feel like we should know
how to do CPR, you know?

93
00:04:29,227 --> 00:04:30,519
Yes. Yes.

94
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,522
Hey. Uh, pepper?

95
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:34,940
And what do we have here?

96
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:37,443
Well, the incident with the jazzman
got me thinking about peppers,

97
00:04:37,444 --> 00:04:38,986
getting peppers back into my life.

98
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:42,490
You know? Peppers spice everything up
from... from tacos to talk shows.

99
00:04:42,491 --> 00:04:43,616
That's cute.

100
00:04:43,617 --> 00:04:45,659
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Okay. I like where your head's at,

101
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:49,079
but I think really
it's maybe a matter of dosage.

102
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,831
Like we-we shouldn't eat a whole pepper.

103
00:04:50,832 --> 00:04:52,291
We saw what happened to the jazzman.

104
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:54,376
I'm thinking maybe microdosing
is the way to go.

105
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:56,170
- Microdose. Explain.
- Yep.

106
00:04:56,171 --> 00:05:00,007
Well, instead of taking 100% of the dose
10% of the time,

107
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:03,761
we take 10% of the dose 100% of the time.

108
00:05:03,762 --> 00:05:05,387
That is scientifically more better.

109
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:06,472
- Wanna try it?
- Yeah.

110
00:05:06,473 --> 00:05:09,392
- All right, just take a little nibble.
- Just a little... a little micro, huh?

111
00:05:11,895 --> 00:05:14,438
- Yeah.
- And then we just need to repeat

112
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:16,857
- that dosage all day and all night.
- Absolutely. That's good.

113
00:05:16,858 --> 00:05:19,318
I'm getting a little heat,
but it's not too much heat.

114
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:21,570
No. I definitely don't need more
than that, know what I mean?

115
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:23,906
- No. I'm gonna need more in 15 minutes.
- Well, sure.

116
00:05:23,907 --> 00:05:25,241
Okay.

117
00:05:25,242 --> 00:05:27,535
- Speaking of spicy...
- How's everyone doing?

118
00:05:27,536 --> 00:05:29,537
<i>...things just got a little caliente.</i>

119
00:05:29,538 --> 00:05:31,413
Hello, class, and welcome.

120
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:36,210
I wanna congratulate you all for making a
decision to pursue a career in this field.

121
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,341
Are you two guys all right?

122
00:05:42,092 --> 00:05:43,175
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

123
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:48,222
Yeah, all good. All good. Uh, and may I,
uh, compliment you on your uniform?

124
00:05:48,223 --> 00:05:51,684
The snugness, uh,
really accentuates your physique.

125
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:53,352
If-If that's okay to say.

126
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:56,046
Uh... It's not, but let's continue, huh?

127
00:05:56,047 --> 00:05:58,107
Uh, if you don't mind,
can we skip to the fun parts?

128
00:05:58,108 --> 00:05:59,985
You're not even letting me get started.

129
00:06:00,527 --> 00:06:04,655
Sorry. My, uh, my partner here,
he's just excited to save lives.

130
00:06:04,656 --> 00:06:06,866
Okay. Well, I applaud you
for your enthusiasm,

131
00:06:06,867 --> 00:06:09,411
but let's stay on track here, huh? Now...

132
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:12,162
- Yes?
- Um...

133
00:06:12,163 --> 00:06:15,165
When I just referred to the gentleman
to my right as my partner,

134
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:17,793
I meant in medicine, not in life.

135
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:20,629
In life, I am very much single.

136
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:23,924
That's great, but I wanna start
this class right now, okay?

137
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:27,261
Oh, God. I-I tell you, man,
I think I got the dosage off.

138
00:06:27,262 --> 00:06:30,556
I think I ate a little bit too much.
Less is more. That's on me.

139
00:06:30,557 --> 00:06:32,433
- The what?
- The hot peppers.

140
00:06:32,434 --> 00:06:35,436
Uh, when do we cover the dosing,
the pepper dosing in the class?

141
00:06:35,437 --> 00:06:37,354
I don't know
what you're even talking about,

142
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:39,982
but I tell you what, let's talk about CPR.

143
00:06:39,983 --> 00:06:42,652
- Oh, I'd like to volunteer.
- No, I don't...

144
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:45,500
- You're already getting up. All right.
- I'm so sorry.

145
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,239
It's so much spicier than I thought.

146
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,033
Now, when we get
to the chest compressions,

147
00:06:49,034 --> 00:06:51,493
should I take your shirt off
or should you take mine off?

148
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:52,578
No shirts come off.

149
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:54,955
Actually, I'd love to take my shirt off.
I'm getting pretty sweaty.

150
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:57,416
- Can we start with the dummies, please?
- Okay.

151
00:06:57,417 --> 00:07:01,879
And hands go like so, and we want
to start with compressions to the song,

152
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:04,506
<i>♪ Ha, ha, ha, ha, staying alive ♪</i>

153
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:06,383
- Let me give it a shot. Do you mind?
- You wanna step in?

154
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:08,802
Actually, I'd love to step in here
and see this thing.

155
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:09,929
- Sure.
- Yeah.

156
00:07:11,348 --> 00:07:12,766
How's this?

157
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:15,018
That's-That's-That's a little too fast.

158
00:07:15,602 --> 00:07:18,062
And you see, class,
I'm increasing the rate of compressions

159
00:07:18,063 --> 00:07:19,605
to ensure maximum blood flow.

160
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:21,899
- Class, don't listen to him.
- It's so hot!

161
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,942
Now, class, you'll notice
I am still finding a rhythm.

162
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:25,110
That is way too fast.

163
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:27,696
Well, somebody
doesn't understand double time.

164
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:29,741
You see, I'm pushing
to a much spicier song.

165
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:34,203
Is everyone familiar
with the Gipsy Kings's "Bamboléo"?

166
00:07:34,204 --> 00:07:36,330
Ah! An excellent choice, very spicy.

167
00:07:36,331 --> 00:07:39,334
Speaking of spice,
I brought plenty of peppers for everyone.

168
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:50,260
Gosh, that damn lawyer
is gonna jam me the hell up.

169
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:51,537
- Yeah.
- Hang on.

170
00:07:51,538 --> 00:07:53,055
Maybe I should slip him a ghost pepper.

171
00:07:53,056 --> 00:07:56,475
Yeah, well, that's a good idea.
All right, uh, chili flakes, please.

172
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:57,559
Wait. What?

173
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,353
I-I need the chili flakes,
please. See them?

174
00:07:59,354 --> 00:08:00,813
- Yeah, I see 'em.
- "Yes, Chef."

175
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:02,439
- What?
- Say, "Yes, Chef."

176
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,524
Why?

177
00:08:03,525 --> 00:08:07,319
Because the stakes are, uh, very high,
you know, this is high-stakes stuff.

178
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,404
Stakes of what?

179
00:08:08,405 --> 00:08:10,656
The cooking!
It's-It's life-and-death stuff, man.

180
00:08:10,657 --> 00:08:12,783
- I need you to say, "Yes, chef."
- You know what you should do?

181
00:08:12,784 --> 00:08:16,537
You should cook up an extra spicy meal.
Really, really spicy.

182
00:08:16,538 --> 00:08:19,581
And I'll give it to The Lawyer.
I'll trick him into eating it.

183
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:21,609
And then if he's not admitted
to the hospital,

184
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:23,043
it would prove that I'm innocent.

185
00:08:23,044 --> 00:08:24,378
Okay, what if he dies?

186
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:25,629
Win-win either way, right?

187
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:27,798
- All right.
- Oh!

188
00:08:27,799 --> 00:08:29,883
- Try that, baby!
- Good smash.

189
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:31,009
- Smashed it good!
- Really?

190
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:33,554
- You know how to do that?
- Yeah, it's a brick-based medium.

191
00:08:33,555 --> 00:08:34,972
- Is it?
- Yeah, that's my favorite part.

192
00:08:34,973 --> 00:08:36,975
What do you think?
Same as a smash burger, right?

193
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:40,436
- It's great!
- Well, I added a little extra spice.

194
00:08:40,437 --> 00:08:42,896
- Oh, yeah. I can feel it.
- I've been microdosing myself.

195
00:08:42,897 --> 00:08:44,982
- Hey, yo. Here we go, Frank.
- Yeah, it goes right up.

196
00:08:44,983 --> 00:08:46,400
Your smash burger.

197
00:08:46,401 --> 00:08:48,152
- No, you're too late.
- Yeah. Sorry about that.

198
00:08:48,153 --> 00:08:50,320
That's because I got smashed
by a Prius.

199
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:51,655
- Oh. Yeah.
- Whoops! Yeah.

200
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:53,407
- I need some shin guards, I think.
- Yeah, looks bad.

201
00:08:53,408 --> 00:08:54,375
Yeah, it doesn't feel good.

202
00:08:54,376 --> 00:08:56,577
Well, Charlie already made me one,
so you get no tip.

203
00:08:56,578 --> 00:08:58,620
- Charlie made you that?
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

204
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:00,789
It's basically the same exact thing
as that smash burger.

205
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:02,082
- Really good.
- Ho-Hold on a second.

206
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:04,668
- What else can you make?
- I can make anything. You kidding me?

207
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:07,004
Okay. Well, hold on.
I'm-I'm getting an idea here.

208
00:09:07,005 --> 00:09:08,255
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

209
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:11,216
What if you help me
spice up my job a little bit, right?

210
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:13,385
And we make this sort
of a ghost kitchen situation.

211
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:16,263
We do it right here.
I keep my work central,

212
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:18,599
but I really get to crank out the orders
a lot faster.

213
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,267
Okay, I like it.
I'll do this for you, Dee.

214
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:21,894
I will, but you gotta
promise me something.

215
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:25,064
You gotta say, "Yes, chef," "No, chef,"
"On your left, chef," "Corner, chef."

216
00:09:25,065 --> 00:09:27,024
These kind of things.
It's gotta work that way, Dee.

217
00:09:27,025 --> 00:09:29,611
- It's gotta work that way.
- Why would I say any of those things?

218
00:09:29,861 --> 00:09:31,361
'Cause we're cooking food.

219
00:09:31,362 --> 00:09:33,447
- Yep, just food.
- It's good.

220
00:09:33,448 --> 00:09:35,241
Doesn't seem like that big of a deal.

221
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:37,744
It's the most serious thing...

222
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:40,538
- that has ever--
- Yes, chef.

223
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:42,372
- Yes, chef.
- Yeah?

224
00:09:42,373 --> 00:09:43,707
- Don't care. Yep.
- Isn't that great?

225
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:45,167
Wait, wait, wait. Dee, before you go,

226
00:09:45,168 --> 00:09:47,170
wanna spice up your bike ride
with a habanero?

227
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:53,092
Coming through. Coming through!

228
00:09:53,093 --> 00:09:55,803
On your left, bitch.

229
00:09:57,472 --> 00:09:59,306
Yo! Look out. Look out.
Look out. Look out, bitch!

230
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:00,390
Move it, boner.

231
00:10:00,391 --> 00:10:02,393
Goddamn. Ooh.

232
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:09,066
Buddy,
getting a refund on those classes

233
00:10:09,067 --> 00:10:11,985
and spending it on a decommissioned
ambulance was the way to go.

234
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:15,155
The illegality of what we're doing
is spicy enough to get me off.

235
00:10:15,156 --> 00:10:17,783
And speaking of spice,
I think we should up the dose.

236
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:19,868
I think we should cool it
on the peppers for a little bit.

237
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:23,330
I mean, you take too much of those things
and you can go temporarily blind.

238
00:10:23,331 --> 00:10:26,375
- Blind? That's crazy. No, you can't.
- Y-Yes, you can.

239
00:10:26,376 --> 00:10:29,086
<i>Zebra 3? Zebra 3?
You anywhere near 2nd and Race?</i>

240
00:10:29,087 --> 00:10:31,004
<i>Got a woman
with an injury on the sidewalk.</i>

241
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:32,923
Second and Race? That's like a block away.

242
00:10:32,924 --> 00:10:34,425
- Yeah.
- Maybe we should answer it.

243
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:37,469
- Well, here's one issue.
- What?

244
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:39,889
- We are not EMTs.
- Right.

245
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:42,600
<i>This is Zebra 3.
We are 20 out. Go to closer unit.</i>

246
00:10:43,393 --> 00:10:46,062
<i>It's only a turned knee
and a run to St. Mercy's.
I'm sure she can wait.</i>

247
00:10:46,604 --> 00:10:48,605
This is Flaming Pepper,
new truck on the rotation.

248
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:50,775
We're only about a block away.
We're gonna stop by.

249
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:54,070
<i>Roger that, Flaming Pepper.
I'll let her know you're on the way.</i>

250
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:55,863
What are you doing?

251
00:10:55,864 --> 00:10:58,824
I don't know. I mean, look, what could
be spicier than answering a call?

252
00:10:58,825 --> 00:11:00,409
Plus, it's only a hospital run.
No big deal.

253
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:01,994
I am intrigued that it's a woman.

254
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:03,579
Pop a pepper and let's go?

255
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:04,663
You know what? Let's do it.

256
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:07,541
But let's-let's cool it on the peppers,
all right? Let's be professional.

257
00:11:07,542 --> 00:11:09,168
We'll-We'll take some peppers afterwards.

258
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:10,961
Professional. You got it.

259
00:11:19,304 --> 00:11:20,345
That's probably enough of the...

260
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:21,973
- It's doing it on its own.
- Yeah. Yeah.

261
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:33,358
- Ma'am?
- How we doing over here, ma'am?

262
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:34,693
What seems to be the problem?

263
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:37,696
This crazy woman jumps
the curb on her bicycle

264
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:40,115
yelling nonsense about hot peppers.

265
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:42,534
I think I twisted my knee.
It might be sprained.

266
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:44,913
- Ugh. It's terrible.
- Yeah.

267
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:48,498
Uh, ma'am, would you, uh, excuse us
for one quick second?

268
00:11:48,499 --> 00:11:50,126
- Come talk to me over here.
- Yeah.

269
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:52,502
- Did you pepper up?
- No.

270
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:54,047
- Yes, you did.
- No.

271
00:11:54,756 --> 00:11:56,590
- Okay, I just had a little bit o--
- Goddamn it.

272
00:11:56,591 --> 00:11:58,383
Now you're not microdosing anymore.

273
00:11:58,384 --> 00:11:59,635
You've slipped into macrodosing.

274
00:11:59,636 --> 00:12:00,744
- Macrodosing.
- Yeah.

275
00:12:00,745 --> 00:12:02,095
That's cool 'cause it's my name.

276
00:12:02,096 --> 00:12:04,515
All right. Damn it.
You know what?

277
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:07,893
Give me a little bit.
'Cause I feel like I'm dipping a little.

278
00:12:07,894 --> 00:12:09,186
Just a little, dude.

279
00:12:09,187 --> 00:12:12,064
I'm not going to macrodose or anything.
But, you know, a little something.

280
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:14,233
- Yeah.
- Oh, God. Man, that is the stuff.

281
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:15,943
But it's a mild heat, right?

282
00:12:15,944 --> 00:12:18,612
- Holy shit. All right. Okay.
- Oh, yeah. It's good.

283
00:12:18,613 --> 00:12:19,821
Let's save this bitch.

284
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:22,241
Ma'am. I think what you've got there
is a sprain.

285
00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:24,868
You're gonna not wanna
put anything hot on it.

286
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:27,287
- Or cold.
- Yeah. Nothing hot, nothing cold.

287
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:28,372
Yeah. Lukewarm, really.

288
00:12:28,373 --> 00:12:30,707
Ma'am, you're gonna... you're gonna
wanna keep that knee lukewarm.

289
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:33,461
You're gonna wanna take short,
shallow breaths.

290
00:12:34,379 --> 00:12:36,546
Oh, you know what?
I gotta check her for a concussion

291
00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:38,757
- because I feel like she's acting crazy.
- I-I-I didn't hit my head.

292
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:40,092
Just lay back and--

293
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:44,930
Oh, God. Oh, my eye is burning.
Was there something on your thumb?

294
00:12:44,931 --> 00:12:46,265
It's probably unrelated.

295
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:48,308
Oh, ma'am.
You're becoming a bit hysterical.

296
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:49,893
Why don't I do
some chest compressions on you.

297
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:52,437
- You wanna pop that sweater off?
- What? No, I need to rinse my eye.

298
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:53,939
Well, the sweater needs to come off.

299
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,357
- Yeah, let's make her unconscious.
- Why?

300
00:12:55,358 --> 00:12:56,900
I feel like
this is becoming a whole thing.

301
00:12:56,901 --> 00:13:01,030
- What?
- Okay, ma'am, we're gonna get you
to the hospital right now.

302
00:13:03,408 --> 00:13:05,827
Dude, this is incredible. I feel so alive.

303
00:13:06,953 --> 00:13:08,412
She definitely wants to bang me, dude.

304
00:13:08,413 --> 00:13:10,580
- Yeah. Don't you think?
- Yeah, I think so.

305
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:17,422
Yo. Order up. Let's go.

306
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:20,008
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

307
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:30,518
I got it.

308
00:13:31,436 --> 00:13:33,396
- Hey. Wow, he's okay.
- Hey.

309
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:40,902
Move!

310
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:42,447
You dumb bitch.

311
00:13:45,408 --> 00:13:47,451
Yeah! All right.

312
00:13:47,452 --> 00:13:50,705
- These are the Chipotle burritos.
- Chipotle burritos. Yes, chef.

313
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:52,539
How's the spice pot?

314
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:53,875
Spice pot is

315
00:13:54,868 --> 00:13:56,418
spicy but needs more peppers.

316
00:13:56,419 --> 00:13:58,211
Peppers coming up. More peppers.

317
00:13:58,212 --> 00:14:00,005
- Here we go.
- Yep. I needed a "Yes, chef" there.

318
00:14:00,006 --> 00:14:02,466
- Yes, chef. Yes, chef.
- Yes, chef. Yes, chef!

319
00:14:05,762 --> 00:14:08,263
Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on.
Come on. Come on. Come on. Let's go.

320
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:09,681
Go, go, go, go, go, go.

321
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:17,773
I don't know.
I don't think he's gonna make it.

322
00:14:17,774 --> 00:14:19,816
- Looks like he's gonna die.
- He's going in and out, isn't he?

323
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:21,569
- Should we pepper?
- You want some pepper, sir?

324
00:14:22,045 --> 00:14:23,987
Goddamn it. Hands. I need hands.

325
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:25,947
- Let's do it. Let's go.
- Go, go, go, go, go, Frank.

326
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:29,076
- Go. Put the burger down. Go!
- Come on, Frank. Come on!

327
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:32,746
Hot fries. Hot fries. Hot fries.

328
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:38,043
Sir. Are you okay?

329
00:14:38,044 --> 00:14:40,671
- I think we gotta do compressions, man.
- Compressions, go.

330
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:50,389
Come on. Pick it up, grandpa.

331
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:56,520
Whoo! Oh, God! It's all seeds.

332
00:14:56,521 --> 00:14:57,771
It's all seeds.

333
00:15:05,363 --> 00:15:06,572
Order up.

334
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:11,827
We did it, Charlie. This chili
is maxed out. I mean, I gotta go.

335
00:15:11,828 --> 00:15:14,788
Oh, what? What? No.
You can't go. Come on, I got orders, bud.

336
00:15:14,789 --> 00:15:16,706
I gotta go trick The Lawyer.

337
00:15:16,707 --> 00:15:18,500
Come on, I need my expediter.

338
00:15:18,501 --> 00:15:19,960
What? I'll be in here all by myself?

339
00:15:19,961 --> 00:15:22,087
Come on, Frank, I need you, buddy.

340
00:15:22,088 --> 00:15:24,047
- Hey, yo! There he is.
- Oh!

341
00:15:24,048 --> 00:15:25,632
- What do you got for us, buddy?
- Oh.

342
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:27,467
Anything for my first responders.

343
00:15:27,468 --> 00:15:30,804
My guy. My guy. My guy. Hey! All right.

344
00:15:32,682 --> 00:15:34,349
- Oh, yeah.
- That's hot.

345
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:38,228
Getting high
on your own supply over there?

346
00:15:38,229 --> 00:15:39,563
You mind?

347
00:15:39,564 --> 00:15:41,189
Yeah. Well, I'm in the weeds, boys.

348
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:42,732
You know, I need it just to get by.

349
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:45,527
How's it going for you fellas?
How's it going out there in the streets?

350
00:15:45,528 --> 00:15:48,613
- Highs and lows. I don't love the blood.
- A lot of blood in my line of work too.

351
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:50,282
Well, there shouldn't be.

352
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:52,325
Yeah, but you get the finger.
I got Frank once or twice.

353
00:15:52,326 --> 00:15:54,578
- There really shouldn't be--
- It's life-and-death stuff.

354
00:15:54,579 --> 00:15:55,829
Not really though.

355
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:58,373
It is for the animals, I guess.

356
00:15:58,374 --> 00:16:00,917
I always feel like I could use a little
more action, you know what I mean?

357
00:16:00,918 --> 00:16:02,711
- You want more spice?
- I want more spice.

358
00:16:02,712 --> 00:16:03,795
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

359
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:04,880
Okay. I'm done.

360
00:16:04,881 --> 00:16:06,214
- Pepper me.
- Oh!

361
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:07,674
Bingo!

362
00:16:07,675 --> 00:16:09,134
Dang, what happened to you?

363
00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:11,303
Oh, bike got smashed by a crosstown bus.

364
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:13,347
- Smashing ups everywhere.
- Interesting.

365
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:17,810
Hey, this-this-this might be the peppers
talking here, but, um, go with me.

366
00:16:18,352 --> 00:16:21,730
I'm sensing an opportunity
to smash all of these ideas together...

367
00:16:21,731 --> 00:16:24,233
...and really spice up our lives.

368
00:16:25,193 --> 00:16:27,444
Now I'm gonna float out something
that I believe to be...

369
00:16:27,445 --> 00:16:30,197
...a very reasonable proposition.

370
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:34,076
What is it?

371
00:16:36,129 --> 00:16:38,413
Okay, I got two smash burgers
and a side of curly fries.

372
00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:40,457
- On your left!
- Oh, yeah, thank you.

373
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:43,335
- Thank you what?
- Thank you, chef!

374
00:16:43,336 --> 00:16:44,420
Corner!

375
00:16:51,177 --> 00:16:53,596
This is the spice I was looking for, baby!

376
00:16:56,474 --> 00:17:00,186
Well, well, well. Hmm. New office, huh?

377
00:17:00,728 --> 00:17:03,981
Popcorn ceiling, right next
to the highway. This place is trash.

378
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:07,692
Mr. Reynolds, always a pleasure.

379
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:09,444
I wanna talk about a settlement.

380
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:13,073
I bet you do,
because if I were your attorney,

381
00:17:13,074 --> 00:17:15,909
I would be begging for the same thing.

382
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:17,745
But unfortunately for you...

383
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:20,372
- Whoo!
- ...I am not.

384
00:17:20,373 --> 00:17:22,208
My depth perception is terrible.

385
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,376
Why?

386
00:17:24,377 --> 00:17:26,253
Because of the goddamn eye.

387
00:17:26,254 --> 00:17:27,712
What happened to your eye?

388
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:29,172
Are you serious?

389
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:31,299
Let's talk about this like gentlemen.

390
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,717
I brought you some chili.

391
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:35,595
Okay, I'm not eating that.
I'm sure it's poison.

392
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:37,264
Besides, I ordered for myself.

393
00:17:37,265 --> 00:17:38,682
No, my food's better.

394
00:17:38,683 --> 00:17:41,851
And-And there's nothing the matter
with that chili. That is tasty chili.

395
00:17:41,852 --> 00:17:43,728
- I-I promise.
- Hey. Lawyer.

396
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:46,773
- Not now, Dee.
- He Postmated. I'm delivering.

397
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:50,318
Okay-- I don't want any food delivered
by any of you.

398
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:53,405
Oh. Guess what, bozo? I don't care
whether you eat it or not,

399
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:55,699
but if you don't tip me,
I'm taking out the other eye.

400
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:57,826
- Eat mine.
- No.

401
00:17:57,827 --> 00:17:59,912
I'll eat some first. Yeah.

402
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:02,597
- I-I got my own spoon.
- All right, this is bullshit.

403
00:18:02,598 --> 00:18:04,416
If you're not gonna tip me,
I'm eating your lunch.

404
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:07,253
- Be my guest. I don't care.
- What do you think about this?

405
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:11,047
- This is delicious.
- Yep.

406
00:18:11,048 --> 00:18:15,093
- A little hot. Hot, hot, hot.
- Mine too. Not-Not in temperature

407
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:16,970
so much as it's the tiniest bit spicy.

408
00:18:18,806 --> 00:18:21,434
Really enjoying this a lot.

409
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:24,061
I've got to take a knee.

410
00:18:24,604 --> 00:18:26,646
Oh! Shit, shit, shit, shit.

411
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:29,983
How can you possibly
make a burger so spicy?

412
00:18:31,694 --> 00:18:34,238
- This is so hot.
- You've got to try this.

413
00:18:35,865 --> 00:18:37,657
I'll share that with you.

414
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:39,785
Call 911!

415
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:44,331
<i>Got a possible code W59
in progress at Snyder and Pattison.</i>

416
00:18:44,332 --> 00:18:46,041
- Pepper, pepper?
- Pattison? That's like right here.

417
00:18:46,042 --> 00:18:47,877
- Pepper? Pepper, anyone?
- Oh, yes. Absolutely.

418
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:50,463
Yeah. W59? What is that?

419
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:52,839
- Oh!
- Snake bite. That's kind of exciting.

420
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,883
Whoa! That's very interesting to me.

421
00:18:54,884 --> 00:18:57,511
I've always wanted to suck out
snake venom, you know this.

422
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:00,805
- Flaming Pepper taking the call.
- Let's take it.

423
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:02,182
Come on, baby. We're taking the call.

424
00:19:03,768 --> 00:19:05,226
Goddamn it. I'm dying.

425
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:06,436
Oh, come on.

426
00:19:06,437 --> 00:19:08,605
What is it? What's going?
You guys aren't snake bit, are you?

427
00:19:08,606 --> 00:19:11,758
Dee thought that was the only way
we could get you guys to come up here.

428
00:19:11,759 --> 00:19:13,193
We said it was a snake bite.

429
00:19:13,194 --> 00:19:15,070
- I was right.
- This is wonderful.

430
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:18,531
I have absolutely no idea
what the hell is going on here,

431
00:19:18,532 --> 00:19:20,617
but I guarantee you
it's going to help me in my suit.

432
00:19:20,618 --> 00:19:25,414
I love watching all of you fail. Cheers.

433
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:29,167
I got you!

434
00:19:31,462 --> 00:19:32,545
What's in that?

435
00:19:32,546 --> 00:19:37,259
That is 100% juiced Carolina Reaper tea.

436
00:19:38,386 --> 00:19:39,553
I got him.

437
00:19:44,308 --> 00:19:46,226
What's happening to me?

438
00:19:46,227 --> 00:19:48,812
Are you all right?

439
00:19:48,813 --> 00:19:51,064
We're getting close, guys.
Almost there. Just hang on.

440
00:19:51,065 --> 00:19:52,816
How we looking back there?

441
00:19:52,817 --> 00:19:53,900
He's gonna die!

442
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:55,985
Bamboléo. Bamboléo. Bamboléo.
Bamboléo. Bamboléo.

443
00:19:55,986 --> 00:19:58,071
Dee, get those fries
out of the fryer, stat.

444
00:19:58,072 --> 00:20:00,657
It just hurts so bad.
You're overspicing the food, chef.

445
00:20:00,658 --> 00:20:01,908
What are they doing?

446
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:04,703
- Enough with the orders.
- No, no. Just one more drop.

447
00:20:04,704 --> 00:20:06,831
He's gonna die!

448
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:15,922
Oh. Oh, God. It burns! Oh, shit, it burns!

449
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:19,008
Goddamn it, Dennis.
You have to yell "corner!"

450
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:21,678
- I can't see.
- What?

451
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:23,430
Goddamn it!
I think I overdosed on the peppers.

452
00:20:23,431 --> 00:20:24,932
I told you this would happen, Mac.

453
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:31,522
I can't see. Goddamn it! Goddamn you!

454
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:39,488
Oh, fuck!

455
00:20:53,753 --> 00:20:56,546
All right, all right, all right.
I've-I've heard enough.

456
00:20:56,547 --> 00:20:58,131
Joyriding through the city,

457
00:20:58,132 --> 00:21:01,885
serving food without a permit
in an unlicensed ambulance,

458
00:21:01,886 --> 00:21:05,054
all while impersonating
medical professionals.

459
00:21:05,055 --> 00:21:08,558
For what? Your own twisted amusement?

460
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:10,394
What have you got to say for yourself?

461
00:21:11,479 --> 00:21:15,148
I swear there were other people there.

462
00:21:15,149 --> 00:21:19,444
I was strapped into a gurney.
I passed out.

463
00:21:19,445 --> 00:21:25,367
Uh, they must have put me in an EMT
uniform and-and-and fled the scene.

464
00:21:27,495 --> 00:21:29,246
Thirty days, Philly Correctional.

465
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:30,872
Next case.
