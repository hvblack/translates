<i>Cheers is filmed
before a live studio audience.</i>

2
00:00:08,182 --> 00:00:10,915
Hey, Sack-Happy, how you doing?

3
00:00:10,915 --> 00:00:12,852
Hey, there, Rubber Thumbs.

4
00:00:12,887 --> 00:00:15,371
Hey, I thought you'd be
on a dim route by now.

5
00:00:15,371 --> 00:00:18,357
I don't see you pushing
many number one sacks
there, Clavin.

6
00:00:18,392 --> 00:00:20,026
What the heck
are they talking about?

7
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:22,743
It's kind of a postal rap.

8
00:00:23,422 --> 00:00:26,548
Hey, there's a flap that you
had a brush with utility.

9
00:00:26,548 --> 00:00:28,353
Ah, 604 is all the way.

10
00:00:28,353 --> 00:00:31,137
- Yeah, well, you
know the scheme fin.
- Yeah.

11
00:00:31,172 --> 00:00:34,060
You know, I actually once
thought of asking Cliff
what it all meant,

12
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:37,251
but
then it occurred to me
he might tell me.

13
00:00:42,951 --> 00:00:45,368
¶ Making your way
in the world today ¶

14
00:00:45,402 --> 00:00:48,338
¶ Takes everything you've got.

15
00:00:48,372 --> 00:00:51,091
¶ Taking a break
from all your worries ¶

16
00:00:51,125 --> 00:00:53,807
¶ Sure would help a lot.

17
00:00:54,578 --> 00:00:58,533
¶ Wouldn't you like

18
00:01:00,435 --> 00:01:02,303
¶ Sometimes you want to go.

19
00:01:02,303 --> 00:01:06,492
¶ Where everybody
knows your name ¶

20
00:01:07,776 --> 00:01:11,776
¶ And they're always glad
you came ¶

21
00:01:12,246 --> 00:01:14,782
¶ You want to be
where you can see ¶

22
00:01:14,816 --> 00:01:17,484
¶ Our troubles
are all the same ¶

23
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:22,290
¶ You want to be where everybody
knows your name ¶

24
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:25,191
¶ You want to go
where people know ¶

25
00:01:25,226 --> 00:01:27,861
¶ People are all the same.

26
00:01:27,896 --> 00:01:32,554
¶ You want to go where
everybody knows your name. ¶

27
00:01:51,418 --> 00:01:54,654
Well, I, I can't put this off
another minute.

28
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:55,672
What's up, Frasier?

29
00:01:55,706 --> 00:01:57,257
I'm a man in a predicament, Sam.

30
00:01:57,291 --> 00:02:00,694
I've got to find a gift
for the dearest, sweetest,
most wonderful woman on Earth.

31
00:02:00,728 --> 00:02:03,085
So, you finally
dumped Lilith, huh?

32
00:02:03,085 --> 00:02:05,537
No.
It's our one-month anniversary,

33
00:02:05,537 --> 00:02:08,117
and I'm just stumped
about what to get her.

34
00:02:08,151 --> 00:02:12,171
- Any suggestions?
- Well, you could get her
a nice "mank."

35
00:02:12,205 --> 00:02:16,474
- "Mank"?
- Yeah. You know,
it's a mock mink.

36
00:02:16,474 --> 00:02:18,394
I got one for Vera.

37
00:02:18,429 --> 00:02:20,698
You cannot tell it
from the real thing.
It's great.

38
00:02:20,698 --> 00:02:24,517
Unless, of course, it rains,
and then you just
toss it in the dryer,

39
00:02:24,552 --> 00:02:26,579
and you leave the house
for a couple hours.

40
00:02:28,222 --> 00:02:31,884
Well, I suppose
I'll think of something.
Wish me luck.

41
00:02:31,884 --> 00:02:33,609
Hey, Cliff, new suit?

42
00:02:33,609 --> 00:02:37,200
Oh, well, no, actually,
I just had it dry cleaned
there, Doc.

43
00:02:37,998 --> 00:02:39,115
Uh, hey, Woody.

44
00:02:39,149 --> 00:02:42,611
<i>A beer, and uh, one for
mi compadre here, Normie.</i>

45
00:02:45,356 --> 00:02:47,790
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, no, it's just...

46
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:51,755
Sorry. I thought Cliff was
going to buy me a beer.

47
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:58,595
Well, uh, well, I am.

48
00:03:00,454 --> 00:03:03,739
Hey, hey, Norm,
Norm, no, come on, now,
knock it off there, will you?

49
00:03:03,774 --> 00:03:08,033
Geez. It's just that my annual
civil service raise
came in today, you know,

50
00:03:08,033 --> 00:03:11,280
at three and a half percent,
just like clockwork,

51
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,224
you know, as if, uh,
carrying that bag
wasn't honor enough.

52
00:03:14,224 --> 00:03:17,203
- Wow, Mr. Clavin, you
got a raise, huh?
- Yup.

53
00:03:17,203 --> 00:03:20,506
I've been hoping
for a raise for two years now.
I haven't gotten diddly.

54
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:22,292
Well, Woody, that is an outrage.

55
00:03:22,326 --> 00:03:26,679
You ought to walk
right up to Miss Howe,
look her square in the eye,
and demand diddly.

56
00:03:27,481 --> 00:03:31,650
Ah, tell you what,
you work overtime,
you get over-diddly, pal.

57
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:34,393
And, uh, diddly-
and-a-half on weekends,

58
00:03:34,393 --> 00:03:36,962
and, uh, golden diddly
on holidays, too.

59
00:03:36,962 --> 00:03:38,739
Uh, Cliff, Cliff...

60
00:03:38,739 --> 00:03:41,743
The secret
is knowing when to stop.

61
00:03:42,679 --> 00:03:44,443
Hey, uh, Sam? Yeah?

62
00:03:44,443 --> 00:03:46,933
Do you think Miss Howe
would give me a raise
if I asked her?

63
00:03:46,967 --> 00:03:49,419
Well, let's see, uh,
you're a good bartender,

64
00:03:49,453 --> 00:03:52,388
you've never had a vacation,
you never been out sick.

65
00:03:52,422 --> 00:03:54,144
Probably not.

66
00:03:54,144 --> 00:03:56,993
- Aw, gee, really, Sam?
- Oh, she's tough.

67
00:03:57,027 --> 00:03:59,739
- Maybe if you get her
in a good mood.
- Uh, how do I do that?

68
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:03,149
Well, put her in a good mood,
you know?
Be nice to her; Compliment her.

69
00:04:03,183 --> 00:04:05,330
Compliment... right. Yeah.

70
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:08,236
Okay, thanks, Sam. Mm-hmm.
I'll do it.

71
00:04:08,236 --> 00:04:10,206
Uh, what should I compliment?

72
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,588
I don't know;
First thing you see, Woody.

73
00:04:13,344 --> 00:04:15,127
Come in.

74
00:04:15,127 --> 00:04:18,921
Miss Howe, did I ever tell you
you have a nice...?

75
00:04:21,902 --> 00:04:23,848
Uh, smile?

76
00:04:24,838 --> 00:04:26,544
Thank you, Woody.

77
00:04:27,525 --> 00:04:29,657
Was there something you wanted?

78
00:04:29,657 --> 00:04:34,664
Well, uh, Miss Howe,
I've been here at Cheers
for quite a while now.

79
00:04:34,698 --> 00:04:38,358
I'm a good worker,
I don't take vacations,
I'm never sick,

80
00:04:38,358 --> 00:04:39,836
and I was just wondering if...

81
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:41,797
No, Woody, Woody, I'm going
to have to stop you right there.

82
00:04:41,797 --> 00:04:45,308
- I cannot give you a title.
- "Title"?

83
00:04:45,342 --> 00:04:49,378
Yes, I know you deserve it,
but the front office
just doesn't let me
hand those things out.

84
00:04:49,413 --> 00:04:50,671
No, Miss Howe,
you don't understand.

85
00:04:50,671 --> 00:04:54,547
You know, sometimes people
work here ten, 15 years
before receiving a title.

86
00:04:54,547 --> 00:04:57,370
- How can I justify...?
- Miss Howe, I want a raise.

87
00:04:57,404 --> 00:05:01,225
Oh, is that all?
That's fine.
How much do you want?

88
00:05:02,743 --> 00:05:04,999
- Just like that?
- Well, of course.

89
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,563
I thought you came in here
to beat me out of a title,

90
00:05:06,563 --> 00:05:08,707
but if you just want
to settle for money,
well, that's fine.

91
00:05:08,707 --> 00:05:11,862
Wait a minute.
Let's just stick
with this title thing.

92
00:05:12,269 --> 00:05:15,974
No, no, Woody, you said
you would settle for a raise.

93
00:05:15,974 --> 00:05:17,524
Now, I'm going
to hold you to it.

94
00:05:17,558 --> 00:05:20,328
Oh, no, I blew it!

95
00:05:21,295 --> 00:05:23,829
I should have demanded a title.

96
00:05:23,829 --> 00:05:27,302
Money gets spent,
but titles are forever.

97
00:05:27,302 --> 00:05:30,025
- No, Woody, I told you...
- Doggone it, Miss Howe,

98
00:05:30,025 --> 00:05:33,022
you're not going
to palm some raise off on me.

99
00:05:33,056 --> 00:05:36,309
I don't want money.
I-I deserve a title.

100
00:05:36,343 --> 00:05:41,538
Woody, I've met some tough
negotiators in my life...

101
00:05:41,711 --> 00:05:45,262
All right, you deserve it.
I'll go to the mat for you.

102
00:05:45,262 --> 00:05:49,205
Congratulations.
You're the new Senior Bartender.

103
00:05:49,239 --> 00:05:52,642
Get out! Senior Bartender?!

104
00:05:52,676 --> 00:05:54,927
Wait till I tell my folks!

105
00:05:54,961 --> 00:05:58,944
To think I came in here
asking for
a stupid little raise,
and now this.

106
00:05:58,944 --> 00:06:00,633
I just hope
it doesn't go to my head.

107
00:06:00,668 --> 00:06:03,769
Oh... that's what's nice
about you, Woody.

108
00:06:03,804 --> 00:06:06,205
Nothing ever goes to your head.

109
00:06:10,561 --> 00:06:14,525
Hey.
So, did you get the raise?

110
00:06:14,525 --> 00:06:18,353
Sammy, Sammy, Sammy,
Sammy, Sammy.

111
00:06:18,769 --> 00:06:20,747
There's more to life than money.

112
00:06:20,747 --> 00:06:23,239
Oh, no,
you didn't get the raise.

113
00:06:23,274 --> 00:06:24,708
I got something much better.

114
00:06:24,742 --> 00:06:27,777
You're looking at Cheers'
new Senior Bartender.

115
00:06:27,812 --> 00:06:30,146
Oh, Woody, you didn't fall
for that, did you?

116
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:32,343
- Fall for what?
- Oh, man, she conned you.

117
00:06:32,343 --> 00:06:36,202
She talked you
into accepting a title
instead of a raise.
I don't believe you.

118
00:06:36,237 --> 00:06:37,927
Hey, I'd like to
see you do better.

119
00:06:37,927 --> 00:06:41,974
Hey...
she may be able to pull the wool
over your eyes, but not mine.

120
00:06:42,009 --> 00:06:44,310
As a matter of fact,
I'll prove it to you.

121
00:06:44,344 --> 00:06:47,892
You know, I'm due for a raise
around here.
Behold the master here.

122
00:06:47,892 --> 00:06:50,511
- Woody, watch the bar.
- Sam. Mm-hmm.

123
00:06:50,511 --> 00:06:54,270
Considering my new title,
I don't think you can just
give me orders like that.

124
00:06:54,305 --> 00:06:57,190
You're right.
Please forgive me.

125
00:06:57,224 --> 00:06:59,748
Um, I respectfully
request permission

126
00:06:59,748 --> 00:07:03,473
to ask you
to watch the bar, sir.

127
00:07:04,198 --> 00:07:07,442
Money can't buy
that kind of respect.

128
00:07:09,302 --> 00:07:11,784
- I was wondering...
- The answer is no.

129
00:07:11,784 --> 00:07:14,602
Oh, come on, a little raise
is not going to kill you.

130
00:07:14,602 --> 00:07:16,989
No, a little raise
is not going to kill me.

131
00:07:16,989 --> 00:07:20,446
And neither are those little
free rounds of drinks
we're always giving everyone.

132
00:07:20,481 --> 00:07:22,997
Or the little bar tabs
all our friends are
always running up.

133
00:07:22,997 --> 00:07:26,269
But you add them all together,
and they spell bankruptcy.

134
00:07:26,303 --> 00:07:28,652
Which is probably
more than you can do.

135
00:07:28,652 --> 00:07:32,191
Wait a minute.
What do you mean "bankruptcy"?

136
00:07:32,226 --> 00:07:34,243
We're losing money, Sam.

137
00:07:34,278 --> 00:07:37,857
And as long as we are,
no one's getting a raise.
Nothing.

138
00:07:37,857 --> 00:07:39,748
All right, all right.

139
00:07:39,783 --> 00:07:43,355
But if you want to go out there
and save face
in front of your friends,

140
00:07:43,355 --> 00:07:46,705
I can give you a title
just like I did Woody.

141
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:51,086
Oh... come on.
A-a title to save face?

142
00:07:51,086 --> 00:07:53,617
How childish do you think I am?

143
00:07:54,381 --> 00:07:56,385
Senior Bartender, huh?

144
00:07:56,385 --> 00:07:59,652
Well, Wood, you
know, I'd say a, uh,
little promotion like that

145
00:07:59,687 --> 00:08:02,388
kind of deserves a round
of drinks on the house.

146
00:08:02,422 --> 00:08:04,356
Aw, gee, Mr. Peterson,
I'd love to,

147
00:08:04,391 --> 00:08:08,260
and I-I'm real sorry, but gosh,
I-I just don't think I'd better.

148
00:08:08,295 --> 00:08:11,583
Boy, you give a guy a title,
he turns into a fascist.

149
00:08:12,283 --> 00:08:16,786
So, Wood, now that you scratched
and clawed your way
to the top of your profession,

150
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:18,730
are you still going
to talk to us little people?

151
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:20,580
"Little people"?

152
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:25,602
Oh, right, uh,
you folks don't like
to be called midgets anymore.

153
00:08:27,447 --> 00:08:29,131
Sure, I'll talk to you.

154
00:08:29,165 --> 00:08:32,969
It won't be easy with
your tongue in another state.

155
00:08:35,873 --> 00:08:37,946
So, Sam, how much did you get?

156
00:08:37,946 --> 00:08:39,688
Well, it's kind of complicated,
Woody.

157
00:08:39,688 --> 00:08:43,012
It's all tied up with bonuses
and stock options.

158
00:08:43,047 --> 00:08:46,304
But I can
tell you that,
uh, you're looking at
the new

159
00:08:46,304 --> 00:08:49,617
Executive
Supervising Bartender.

160
00:08:49,617 --> 00:08:52,655
Well, congratulations, Sammy.

161
00:08:52,689 --> 00:08:55,758
You know, I'd say a
promotion like that
kind of deserves a round
of drinks on the house.

162
00:08:55,758 --> 00:08:57,371
Nice try, man. Well, you know.

163
00:08:57,371 --> 00:09:01,513
You just couldn't stand it, Sam,
could you?
That I had a title
and you didn't.

164
00:09:01,548 --> 00:09:05,367
Oh, come on, Woody.
These titles
don't mean anything.

165
00:09:05,402 --> 00:09:07,095
- You want to switch?
- Right.

166
00:09:07,095 --> 00:09:11,005
Senior Bartender.
Like I've been dying
for that one all my life.

167
00:09:11,942 --> 00:09:15,478
Hey, at least mine's
a real great title
and not a stupid
made-up one like yours.

168
00:09:15,512 --> 00:09:16,597
Hey, mine is not made up.

169
00:09:16,597 --> 00:09:19,265
Hey, hey, all right,
all right, all right,
knock it off, all right?!

170
00:09:19,299 --> 00:09:23,369
Will the Senior Idiot Bartender
and the Executive
Supervising Moron

171
00:09:23,403 --> 00:09:25,704
shut their yaps
for about ten seconds?

172
00:09:25,739 --> 00:09:27,644
You're bartenders.
That's it.

173
00:09:27,644 --> 00:09:31,377
You're a bartender
and you're a bartender, period.

174
00:09:32,830 --> 00:09:35,815
Carla's right.
I'm sorry.

175
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:37,766
Yeah, me, too.

176
00:09:37,766 --> 00:09:42,583
I, however, am
the Managing Director
of Waitresses.

177
00:09:43,298 --> 00:09:45,970
Well, uh,
congratulations, Carla.

178
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:48,247
You know, I'd say...
Give it up, Norm.

179
00:09:49,162 --> 00:09:51,714
That does it. What?

180
00:09:54,985 --> 00:09:58,868
Miss Howe, I heard about Carla
and Sam's new titles,

181
00:09:58,868 --> 00:10:00,690
and I must say
I've got a problem.

182
00:10:00,724 --> 00:10:04,252
You've got a problem?
I'll tell you about problems.

183
00:10:04,252 --> 00:10:06,562
I will tell you
all about problems.

184
00:10:06,597 --> 00:10:08,798
We've been losing money
for the last three months.

185
00:10:08,832 --> 00:10:11,925
I have just been informed
that if we continue
to lose money,

186
00:10:11,925 --> 00:10:13,719
the bar is going to
be put on the block,

187
00:10:13,753 --> 00:10:15,200
and then my career will be over,

188
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,267
and so will everyone's
drinking days here at Cheers.

189
00:10:18,267 --> 00:10:20,286
Understood?

190
00:10:29,987 --> 00:10:34,890
Well...
maybe it isn't exactly my
place to say this, but...

191
00:10:34,925 --> 00:10:38,277
Cheers means about as much to me
as it does to anyone here.

192
00:10:38,311 --> 00:10:41,125
This is, uh,
pretty bad news.

193
00:10:41,125 --> 00:10:43,384
I'd say bad news like this

194
00:10:43,384 --> 00:10:46,991
deserves a sympathy
round of drinks
on the house.

195
00:10:47,254 --> 00:10:49,601
What? Oh, what?!

196
00:11:00,864 --> 00:11:03,325
You really don't think
we're gonna lose the bar,
do you?

197
00:11:03,325 --> 00:11:07,090
I mean,
what are we gonna do?
Where are we gonna go?

198
00:11:07,124 --> 00:11:09,061
Home?

199
00:11:09,359 --> 00:11:13,846
All right, listen,
listen, listen.
We-We got to think of some way
to drum up business.

200
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:16,583
Well, what do you want us to do,
force people to drink here?

201
00:11:16,617 --> 00:11:18,825
- Pour beers down their throats?
- No, Carla.

202
00:11:18,825 --> 00:11:21,343
Well, don't be hasty, Sam.
Let her talk.

203
00:11:21,343 --> 00:11:23,706
- Norm,
you-you work for the big firms.

204
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:25,608
What do they do
when they need a lot of money?

205
00:11:25,642 --> 00:11:29,562
All right, first off, they...
They go and fire
all the dead wood.

206
00:11:29,596 --> 00:11:33,071
- Yeah, then what?
- I'm long gone by then, Sam.

207
00:11:35,102 --> 00:11:38,354
Well, what if we got something
real valuable
that everybody wanted,

208
00:11:38,388 --> 00:11:40,391
and then gave away chances
to win it?

209
00:11:40,391 --> 00:11:42,174
A raffle?

210
00:11:42,208 --> 00:11:47,192
Sam, would you mind giving
my idea a little consideration
before you just jump in
with yours?

211
00:11:47,192 --> 00:11:48,898
No, no, no...

212
00:11:48,933 --> 00:11:50,806
R-Rebecca, hey,
I think we, uh...

213
00:11:50,806 --> 00:11:54,148
We put our heads together here
and came up with a
solution to your problem.

214
00:11:54,148 --> 00:11:56,716
Sam, please. This is my problem.
I'll handle it by myself.

215
00:11:56,716 --> 00:12:00,107
No, hey, listen.
Everybody needs a little
help now and then.

216
00:12:00,761 --> 00:12:04,329
- All right, Sam,
what's your great idea?
- Well, I-I think
you're gonna like it.

217
00:12:04,364 --> 00:12:07,643
It's-it's, uh, real special.
I-I think
you'll be pleasantly surprised.

218
00:12:07,643 --> 00:12:10,887
It's, uh...
well, we hold a raffle.

219
00:12:10,921 --> 00:12:14,990
- Oh, please.
- Well, actually,
it was, uh, Woody's idea.

220
00:12:15,025 --> 00:12:17,301
We could give away
a Caribbean cruise.

221
00:12:17,301 --> 00:12:19,662
Hey, Woodchuck, not a bad idea.

222
00:12:19,697 --> 00:12:22,698
You think she just handed me
this title?

223
00:12:22,732 --> 00:12:25,862
Listen, it'd be perfect.
I mean, people would be pouring
in here.

224
00:12:25,862 --> 00:12:28,988
We'll be out of the red
in no time.
Come on, let's give it a shot.

225
00:12:29,023 --> 00:12:31,024
All right.
Why not?

226
00:12:31,024 --> 00:12:34,226
It's a mark of how
desperate I am
that I'm willing
to take any half-baked,

227
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:37,110
hair-brained scheme
from a bunch of bozos like this.

228
00:12:37,144 --> 00:12:39,544
All we ask for
is a little faith.

229
00:12:40,383 --> 00:12:43,219
Eureka!
I have found it.

230
00:12:43,253 --> 00:12:46,835
Sam, anything
compare to the ebullient feeling
one gets

231
00:12:46,835 --> 00:12:49,683
having discovered
and then purchased a fine work
of art?

232
00:12:49,683 --> 00:12:55,358
Yeah, sticking your foot in
a pan of scalding hot water
when you got a fungus itch.

233
00:12:55,532 --> 00:12:58,184
Well, you may not know art,
but you know what you like.

234
00:12:58,218 --> 00:13:00,123
So, uh, correct me
if I'm wrong there, Doc,

235
00:13:00,123 --> 00:13:03,222
but that's from the, uh,
Machiavellian Cubist era,
isn't it?

236
00:13:03,256 --> 00:13:07,234
No, Cliff, but, uh,
thank you for participating
just the same.

237
00:13:08,129 --> 00:13:11,801
No, my anniversary gift
to Lilith is an abstract
expressionist piece.

238
00:13:11,801 --> 00:13:14,797
Would it be rude to ask
what something
like that might cost?

239
00:13:14,797 --> 00:13:16,585
No, not if you like
and appreciate it.

240
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:18,792
Sorry to interrupt.

241
00:13:19,182 --> 00:13:21,707
Say,
Frasier, w-why'd you buy her
a painting?

242
00:13:21,742 --> 00:13:23,726
Why-Why not get her something
she might actually want?

243
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,724
Oh, no, Lilith will love this.

244
00:13:25,724 --> 00:13:27,246
It's an original Tidwell.

245
00:13:27,281 --> 00:13:31,484
See, it represents
man's struggle
against intransigent fate.

246
00:13:31,518 --> 00:13:33,369
It's called Number Seven.

247
00:13:33,403 --> 00:13:36,889
No. Here, here.
Drink it in for a moment.

248
00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:39,391
And what does it say to you?

249
00:13:39,426 --> 00:13:42,148
It says, we got a live one.

250
00:13:42,996 --> 00:13:45,292
I don't know.
I kind of like it.

251
00:13:45,292 --> 00:13:48,205
Looks like a couple of dogs
getting real familiar.

252
00:13:48,205 --> 00:13:49,750
- Oh, wow.
- Yeah.

253
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:53,513
- Oh, yeah, it sure does.
- Somebody, hose 'em down.

254
00:13:53,513 --> 00:13:57,578
I should have known better
than to show you Philistines
a fine work of art.

255
00:13:59,546 --> 00:14:01,192
Rebecca?

256
00:14:01,192 --> 00:14:04,250
Yes. Uh, do you mind
if I keep this
in your office for a few days?

257
00:14:04,284 --> 00:14:07,089
- It's my anniversary gift
to Lilith.
- Certainly.

258
00:14:07,538 --> 00:14:10,490
I hope she loves you very much.

259
00:14:22,119 --> 00:14:25,154
Woody, aren't you
finished numbering
those Ping-Pong balls yet?

260
00:14:25,189 --> 00:14:28,257
Almost. I'm just putting
happy faces on all the zeros.

261
00:14:28,292 --> 00:14:30,504
There's a shocker.

262
00:14:30,641 --> 00:14:34,471
Boy, I can't believe this.
This place has been
packed for two weeks now.

263
00:14:34,471 --> 00:14:36,849
This contest was a great idea.

264
00:14:36,883 --> 00:14:39,701
I don't know. I kind of like
the way it used
to be around here.

265
00:14:39,736 --> 00:14:41,386
Yeah, know what you mean, Normy.

266
00:14:41,421 --> 00:14:45,919
All these damn people here
treating us like some kind
of public gathering place.

267
00:14:47,244 --> 00:14:51,380
I think this little raffle idea
of mine turned out pretty well,
don't you?

268
00:14:51,414 --> 00:14:54,399
Don't you think you ought
to give me a little thank you?

269
00:14:54,434 --> 00:14:58,283
A little pat on the back?
Or you on your back?

270
00:14:58,707 --> 00:15:01,874
Oh, Sam, when you
say things like that,
you make me love you even more.

271
00:15:01,908 --> 00:15:04,580
You're being sarcastic, right?

272
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:06,192
Are you?

273
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:09,932
Oh, Dr. Crane,
I'm glad you're here.

274
00:15:09,933 --> 00:15:14,453
I hate to mention this, but
you've had that picture
of the two dogs in my office
for quite a while now.

275
00:15:14,487 --> 00:15:17,521
- When are you giving
that to Lilith?
- I'm going to give it
to her tonight.

276
00:15:17,521 --> 00:15:19,482
And by the way,
they are not...

277
00:15:19,482 --> 00:15:22,022
and I can't
say this more emphatically...
two dogs.

278
00:15:22,022 --> 00:15:24,312
Whatever. I want them out
of my office.

279
00:15:24,312 --> 00:15:28,086
They keep reminding me
of how lousy my social life is.

280
00:15:29,002 --> 00:15:33,435
Yeah, but to be honest with ya,
I wouldn't mind winning
that Caribbean cruise prize.

281
00:15:33,435 --> 00:15:36,542
Yeah, call me
Ishmael, but, uh...

282
00:15:36,576 --> 00:15:39,678
Well, the Clavin men, uh,
all go down to the sea.

283
00:15:39,713 --> 00:15:41,731
I guess I must have salt water
in my veins.

284
00:15:41,765 --> 00:15:44,375
Too bad
there isn't an air bubble.

285
00:15:48,138 --> 00:15:49,688
Frasier?

286
00:15:49,722 --> 00:15:53,926
Oh, why there she is now,
the ray of sunshine
I call my blushing bride.

287
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:56,853
Dear, that color jacket
is not good on you.

288
00:15:56,853 --> 00:16:00,394
Yeah.
Sorry, fellas, she's all mine.
You can't have her.

289
00:16:01,651 --> 00:16:04,918
Well, anyway, Happy
Anniversary, my sweet.

290
00:16:04,918 --> 00:16:07,556
Same to you.
Are you ready for dinner?

291
00:16:07,591 --> 00:16:10,411
Yes. Oh, just first, I've got
a little surprise for you.
Now close your eyes.

292
00:16:10,411 --> 00:16:13,579
Oh, Frasier, love, I'm really
not a proponent of surprises.

293
00:16:13,614 --> 00:16:15,497
My father once asked me
to close my eyes,

294
00:16:15,532 --> 00:16:17,624
and he left for two years.

295
00:16:17,624 --> 00:16:19,928
Well, then, keep your eyes open.

296
00:16:19,928 --> 00:16:23,750
Uh, by the way, are you familiar
with the artist Tidwell?
Of course.

297
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:26,998
Isn't he the one
who did the painting
of the two dogs commingling,

298
00:16:26,998 --> 00:16:30,677
then sold it
for an ungodly amount
of money to some ninny?

299
00:16:31,664 --> 00:16:33,516
Yes, that's him.

300
00:16:33,834 --> 00:16:35,701
Well, what's my surprise?

301
00:16:35,735 --> 00:16:39,271
Oh, surprise.
Well, it's nothing, really.

302
00:16:39,306 --> 00:16:41,109
It's no big deal.

303
00:16:41,109 --> 00:16:43,826
It's just, um, my car.

304
00:16:45,095 --> 00:16:48,081
Why, Frasier, I'm overwhelmed.

305
00:16:48,115 --> 00:16:49,612
Your Mercedes?

306
00:16:49,612 --> 00:16:53,666
You know, nothing says loving
like something from Stuttgart.
Shall we?

307
00:16:54,237 --> 00:16:56,404
But what does this have
to do with Tidwell?

308
00:16:56,404 --> 00:16:59,853
Oh, well, that's
his name, you see.
I give all my possessions,
uh, pet names.

309
00:16:59,853 --> 00:17:03,260
Well, by the way,
my, uh, cufflinks,
Bert and Ernie.

310
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:06,315
Attention.
Attention, everyone.

311
00:17:06,349 --> 00:17:09,335
Now's the moment
we've all been waiting for.

312
00:17:09,369 --> 00:17:11,405
I hope you're as
excited as I am,

313
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:15,774
because this is probably
the most exciting event
I've ever been to
in my entire life.

314
00:17:15,809 --> 00:17:19,360
Well, e-except for the time
that our prize cow
Velveeta

315
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:21,717
gave birth
to a two-headed calf.

316
00:17:21,717 --> 00:17:25,443
Now I don't know how
many of you have seen
a two-headed calf get
born,

317
00:17:25,443 --> 00:17:27,024
but the ones
who have will bear me out.

318
00:17:27,024 --> 00:17:27,920
Woody, Woody.

319
00:17:27,954 --> 00:17:29,934
Actually, it's not as exciting
as you might think.

320
00:17:29,934 --> 00:17:32,810
Only one of the heads could move.
Woody.

321
00:17:33,677 --> 00:17:35,977
The other one just
seemed kind of dazed.

322
00:17:36,012 --> 00:17:40,025
- Hey, Woody, pick
the damn number, will you then?
- Oh, okay, okay.

323
00:17:40,584 --> 00:17:42,467
And the winner...

324
00:17:42,502 --> 00:17:47,494
of the Cheers
all-expense paid trip
to the Caribbean is...

325
00:17:49,209 --> 00:17:51,560
Number 99.

326
00:17:51,595 --> 00:17:54,146
Hey, that's me!

327
00:18:09,612 --> 00:18:13,037
Say, Woody, uh,
when you turn this
99 upside down,

328
00:18:13,037 --> 00:18:15,771
it kind of looks like
a 66, doesn't it?

329
00:18:15,771 --> 00:18:18,098
It sure does.

330
00:18:18,786 --> 00:18:22,277
excuse me.
We have a correction.

331
00:18:22,876 --> 00:18:24,881
The winner
is 66.

332
00:18:24,881 --> 00:18:27,676
I've got it. I'm 66!

333
00:18:36,173 --> 00:18:40,388
Everybody,
stop the music, stop the music!

334
00:18:40,388 --> 00:18:44,308
What's going on here?
You called 99.

335
00:18:44,308 --> 00:18:46,977
It is 99!

336
00:18:49,571 --> 00:18:51,633
Hey, stop the music here.

337
00:18:51,633 --> 00:18:54,678
Uh, Wood, Woody, man,
we've got a little problem here.

338
00:18:54,678 --> 00:18:59,312
W-What's the problem?
You chose 99 first.

339
00:19:00,213 --> 00:19:04,885
Yeah, but...
but 66 comes before 99.

340
00:19:05,302 --> 00:19:09,037
Hey, hey, hey, hey,
what the hell kind
of place is this?

341
00:19:09,072 --> 00:19:13,744
Who's the manager here,
and why aren't they serving
free drinks
to calm this angry crowd?

342
00:19:15,411 --> 00:19:21,129
This is...
This starting to stink
as rotten as those, uh,
game show fixes
back in the '50s.

343
00:19:21,368 --> 00:19:23,985
Gentlemen...
Gentlemen, excuse me here.

344
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:27,449
There's obviously been
some mistake,
and I'm very sorry
about that,

345
00:19:27,449 --> 00:19:31,093
but would
one of you please
have the decency
to just give up the trip?

346
00:19:31,127 --> 00:19:33,512
No way! Forget it.
- Forget it.
- No, lady, no.

347
00:19:33,547 --> 00:19:36,677
Hey, hey, whoa, whoa, come on.
You guys don't really want to go
to the Caribbean, do you?

348
00:19:36,677 --> 00:19:39,402
Do you have any idea
what the sun does
to your skin down there?

349
00:19:39,436 --> 00:19:42,082
Oh, what are you talking about?
I'll tell you what
I'm talking...

350
00:19:42,082 --> 00:19:45,374
Here, I want to introduce you
to last year's winner, man.

351
00:19:45,409 --> 00:19:47,543
He's actually 24.

352
00:19:47,577 --> 00:19:51,446
- I fell asleep on the beach.
- Yeah, thank you.

353
00:19:52,816 --> 00:19:54,576
See what I'm talking about.

354
00:19:54,576 --> 00:19:57,901
Listen, lady,
I don't want to be a
hard case about this,

355
00:19:57,901 --> 00:20:00,439
but if I don't get my trip,
you'll be hearing
from my lawyer.

356
00:20:00,473 --> 00:20:02,757
Hey, what's your boss's name?
I want to complain.

357
00:20:02,792 --> 00:20:05,287
That's it.
I've had it. My career is over.

358
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:07,112
Oh, no, come on,
don't give up now.

359
00:20:07,147 --> 00:20:10,232
Listen, you have come
so far to get to where you are.

360
00:20:10,266 --> 00:20:12,128
You gonna throw all that away?

361
00:20:12,128 --> 00:20:14,853
Come on, go back out there
and fight.
Show them how tough you are.

362
00:20:14,887 --> 00:20:18,623
- How?
- Cry your pretty little eyes out.
No man can resist that.

363
00:20:18,658 --> 00:20:21,900
That is insulting.
I will not use those tactics.

364
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:25,297
I will handle this
in a professional,
businesslike manner.

365
00:20:25,332 --> 00:20:27,075
All right, all right.

366
00:20:27,683 --> 00:20:31,820
Excuse me, gentlemen.
There has been a mistake made,

367
00:20:31,854 --> 00:20:35,148
but I am the manager,
and I'm willing to
take responsibility.

368
00:20:35,148 --> 00:20:38,824
What's important to me is that
I have two satisfied customers,

369
00:20:38,824 --> 00:20:41,679
so I'm going to see to it
that both of you get that trip.

370
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:42,653
All right.

371
00:20:42,653 --> 00:20:45,934
Of course, that will probably
mean the end of my job.

372
00:20:45,969 --> 00:20:48,203
My career.

373
00:20:48,238 --> 00:20:51,156
My life, actually.

374
00:20:52,079 --> 00:20:54,144
But I don't want that
to have any bearing on this.

375
00:20:54,144 --> 00:20:56,728
I just want you both
to be really happy.

376
00:20:56,728 --> 00:20:59,929
And maybe you could send me
a postcard
from the Caribbean

377
00:20:59,929 --> 00:21:03,919
and address it to me at...
Oh, I don't know.

378
00:21:03,954 --> 00:21:09,354
The YWCA or skid row
or something.

379
00:21:09,826 --> 00:21:13,330
Now wait a minute, there,
dear, don't cry, uh...

380
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:15,447
You won't lose your job.

381
00:21:15,481 --> 00:21:17,275
I'll, uh, give up the prize.

382
00:21:17,275 --> 00:21:20,951
- You-You will?
- Yeah, sure. I never
win anything anyway.

383
00:21:20,951 --> 00:21:26,247
I've always been a loser.
I've never been able to
hold down a job. Uh...

384
00:21:26,626 --> 00:21:29,890
The, uh,
wife left me a couple
of years ago,

385
00:21:29,890 --> 00:21:34,059
and the... my, uh...
My kids won't talk to me. I...

386
00:21:35,468 --> 00:21:38,537
there, there.

387
00:21:38,571 --> 00:21:41,023
Hey, hey, hey, hey,
listen, uh...

388
00:21:41,057 --> 00:21:43,607
I-I don't really need
to go to the Caribbean.

389
00:21:43,607 --> 00:21:45,565
You go.
No, no.

390
00:21:45,565 --> 00:21:48,263
No, no, no. No.
I-I want you to go.

391
00:21:48,298 --> 00:21:50,415
Oh, yeah,
my wife will understand.

392
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:53,018
I'm married to the most
wonderful woman in the world.

393
00:21:53,053 --> 00:21:56,602
I mean, she's so kind,
so understanding.

394
00:21:56,602 --> 00:21:59,506
And to think
that she can maintain
such a wonderful attitude,

395
00:21:59,506 --> 00:22:03,812
despite being...
confined to that wheelchair.

396
00:22:03,846 --> 00:22:08,277
It's just...
That's the most
beautiful thing I've ever heard.

397
00:22:08,277 --> 00:22:10,544
You know something,
they should both go.

398
00:22:10,544 --> 00:22:13,422
Yeah, they should both go.

399
00:22:13,457 --> 00:22:17,759
Hey, wait a minute,
wait a minute.
What about my sob story?

400
00:22:17,794 --> 00:22:20,672
I got eight kids.

401
00:22:22,366 --> 00:22:24,251
Heard it.

402
00:22:26,936 --> 00:22:29,944
Well, how can they both go?

403
00:22:29,944 --> 00:22:32,819
We don't have enough money
for two trips.

404
00:22:32,819 --> 00:22:36,567
- Well, that figures, huh?
- Oh, what a rip-off!

405
00:22:36,567 --> 00:22:39,053
Uh, whoa, whoa, hey,
hey, take it easy.
Take it easy now.

406
00:22:39,053 --> 00:22:42,150
Maybe they can't
both go on a cruise,
but they can...

407
00:22:42,184 --> 00:22:44,253
Uh, they can both win a prize.

408
00:22:44,253 --> 00:22:45,640
What are you talking about?

409
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:49,090
<i>Well, sure, sure, our
other first prize.</i>

410
00:22:49,125 --> 00:22:51,752
Listen, one of you guys
can go on the cruise,

411
00:22:51,752 --> 00:22:56,031
and the other one
gets this very,
uh, very, special surprise.

412
00:22:56,031 --> 00:22:59,299
Yeah, we have a...
We have a wonderful, uh,

413
00:22:59,299 --> 00:23:01,403
wonderful other first prize.

414
00:23:01,438 --> 00:23:04,394
It's a-a beautiful painting.

415
00:23:06,810 --> 00:23:09,467
Oh, my God,
is that an original Tidwell?

416
00:23:09,467 --> 00:23:11,546
Y-Yes, it certainly is.

417
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:14,278
I've always wanted a Tidwell.
Um...

418
00:23:14,278 --> 00:23:17,519
Uh, would, uh...
Would mind taking the cruise?

419
00:23:17,554 --> 00:23:20,322
- Not at all.
- Thanks.

420
00:23:20,357 --> 00:23:23,476
Boy, I've dreamed
of owning a Tidwell
all of my life.

421
00:23:23,510 --> 00:23:26,528
And you tried to tell us
you were a loser.

422
00:23:26,563 --> 00:23:27,873
Thanks.

423
00:23:27,873 --> 00:23:30,207
Oh, music.

424
00:23:36,406 --> 00:23:40,148
Say, does that, uh, painting
give you any idea
how to thank me?

425
00:23:40,148 --> 00:23:44,431
Yes, Sam.
Next week, we'll all chip
in and have you fixed.

426
00:23:47,384 --> 00:23:49,317
Uh, excuse me, folks.

427
00:23:49,351 --> 00:23:52,187
We still have the consolation
prize to give away.

428
00:23:52,222 --> 00:23:54,997
847 hand-numbered
Ping-Pong balls.

429
00:23:54,997 --> 00:23:57,448
No, Woody,
Woody, Woody, man,
don't do that.

430
00:23:57,827 --> 00:24:02,087
And the winner of the Cheers
consolation prize is...

431
00:24:02,087 --> 00:24:04,981
Number 11!

432
00:24:06,285 --> 00:24:09,288
Oh, no, here we go again.

433
00:24:09,322 --> 00:24:12,293
<i>No, Woody, let me
explain something to you.</i>

434
00:24:12,294 --> 00:24:32,294
translate
