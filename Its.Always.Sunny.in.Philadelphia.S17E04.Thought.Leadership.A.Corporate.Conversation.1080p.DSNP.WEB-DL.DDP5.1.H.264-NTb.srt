1
00:00:07,641 --> 00:00:10,226
<i>Just have a seat right there.
Would you like a drink or?</i>

2
00:00:10,227 --> 00:00:11,477
<i>- No.
- No?</i>

3
00:00:11,478 --> 00:00:13,312
<i>How about a fresh glass of water?</i>

4
00:00:13,313 --> 00:00:16,774
I have to just go back
and gather myself with my buddies

5
00:00:16,775 --> 00:00:19,694
- before we start this. Okay?
- Okay.

6
00:00:19,695 --> 00:00:21,154
- Right. Good.
- But we are on the clock.

7
00:00:21,155 --> 00:00:23,239
Oh, yeah. And for the record, you know,

8
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:26,159
you might want to jot down
how well you're being treated

9
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,829
at this professional establishment.

10
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:31,247
- Frank, get over here.
- Is she from the newspaper?

11
00:00:31,248 --> 00:00:33,082
We are in big trouble.

12
00:00:33,083 --> 00:00:35,752
We gotta come up with a statement
for this reporter.

13
00:00:35,753 --> 00:00:38,004
- She's gonna butcher us.
- Yeah, this is bad.

14
00:00:38,005 --> 00:00:40,381
Why don't we play dumb? Why do
we have to come up with a statement?

15
00:00:40,382 --> 00:00:43,634
Because they found 500 gallons of
baby oil dumped in the Schuylkill River.

16
00:00:43,635 --> 00:00:46,262
Wait. Dee might be right, 'cause they
can't actually prove that that was us.

17
00:00:46,263 --> 00:00:48,598
Well, the 200 Paddy's pub T-shirts
floating around in it

18
00:00:48,599 --> 00:00:50,641
- aren't exactly helping our case, pal.
- Yeah, not helping.

19
00:00:50,642 --> 00:00:52,518
This is a good thing.
This could be our Paddy's-gate.

20
00:00:52,519 --> 00:00:54,854
- Okay, there you go.
- No, but gates aren't a good thing.

21
00:00:54,855 --> 00:00:56,064
I mean, Pizzagate, Watergate.

22
00:00:56,065 --> 00:00:57,648
- Nipplegate. Nipplegate.
- Nipplegate.

23
00:00:57,649 --> 00:00:59,233
Janet Jackson's career was never the same.

24
00:00:59,234 --> 00:01:00,318
You're right, what happened--

25
00:01:00,319 --> 00:01:02,862
- Some things you gotta keep covered up.
- Based off that. Yeah.

26
00:01:02,863 --> 00:01:05,573
- We've gotta come up with a statement.
- Guys, guys, guys, guys!

27
00:01:05,574 --> 00:01:06,866
We can handle this.

28
00:01:06,867 --> 00:01:09,243
I mean this is why we went
to that corporate retreat in Idaho.

29
00:01:10,454 --> 00:01:13,247
We didn't go to the retreat so much
as watched clips of it on YouTube,

30
00:01:13,248 --> 00:01:14,499
but, you know, you're right, Mac.

31
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:18,252
Normally a situation like this
would have me clawing all your faces off,

32
00:01:18,253 --> 00:01:21,048
but I'm not gonna do that.
I'm gonna utilize my words.

33
00:01:22,257 --> 00:01:24,384
I do see your hand
is still in a bit of a claw.

34
00:01:24,385 --> 00:01:25,676
Yeah, I was ready to pounce.

35
00:01:25,677 --> 00:01:27,220
I had it hidden behind my head.
I was ready...

36
00:01:27,221 --> 00:01:29,722
- Yeah, I hid it behind my leg.
- I had a feeling.

37
00:01:29,723 --> 00:01:32,558
- Should we un...
- No, let's all unclaw our hands.

38
00:01:32,559 --> 00:01:34,685
- Right? Because that was the old way.
- Yeah, yeah.

39
00:01:34,686 --> 00:01:35,770
This is the new way, right?

40
00:01:35,771 --> 00:01:37,563
We've got the tools
from the corporate retreat.

41
00:01:37,564 --> 00:01:39,399
- We've got the vocabulary.
- Yeah.

42
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,609
We've got these awesome fleece vests
inspired by the retreat.

43
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:43,694
- Oh, my God, I love the fleece.
- God, I love these vests.

44
00:01:43,695 --> 00:01:45,196
You can let it all go under here.

45
00:01:45,197 --> 00:01:47,824
I appreciate you springing for that,
Frank. Thank you very much.

46
00:01:47,825 --> 00:01:50,034
So, listen,
we can handle this unpleasantry

47
00:01:50,035 --> 00:01:52,829
with the grace and elegance
of any major corporation

48
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:58,085
by utilizing a little thought leadership
and simply talking this thing out.

49
00:01:58,885 --> 00:02:01,789
thought leadership

50
00:02:22,526 --> 00:02:25,027
{\an8}First and foremost, the business
must be protected at all times.

51
00:02:25,028 --> 00:02:26,112
{\an8}- Yeah.
- Yes.

52
00:02:26,113 --> 00:02:28,364
{\an8}The business is infinitely
more important than any individual.

53
00:02:28,365 --> 00:02:32,743
{\an8}Yes, we are of course a family,
but human emotion notwithstanding,

54
00:02:32,744 --> 00:02:35,705
I would be remiss not to mention
that we are a business first,

55
00:02:35,706 --> 00:02:38,958
and as a business, we must behave as such.

56
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:43,337
So I would like to posit, respectfully,
of course, that we put forth an offering.

57
00:02:43,338 --> 00:02:44,589
Yes, a lamb if you will.

58
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:48,551
No, I would say, uh, that lamb right now
could be tender and delicious,

59
00:02:48,552 --> 00:02:52,597
but we have kind of bigger issues
that we're dealing with
that we need to discuss

60
00:02:52,598 --> 00:02:55,683
and maybe, you know,
eating lamb is not the best thing.

61
00:02:55,684 --> 00:02:57,727
- Momentarily speaking.
- Thank you for that, Charlie,

62
00:02:57,728 --> 00:03:00,396
but of course
I'm speaking of a sacrificial lamb.

63
00:03:00,397 --> 00:03:04,108
- Ah!
- Maybe we need to
walk through the series of events

64
00:03:04,109 --> 00:03:06,569
of the incident to figure out
who the fall guy should be,

65
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:11,449
and I would like to respectfully point out
that the phrase is fall "guy."

66
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:14,494
Thank you for pointing out
that gender inequity, Dee.

67
00:03:14,495 --> 00:03:16,996
And, henceforth, let's refer
to that position

68
00:03:16,997 --> 00:03:18,289
- as "fall person."
- Mmm.

69
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:22,251
Or we could circle back
to, uh, animal-related, uh, conversations.

70
00:03:22,252 --> 00:03:26,422
We could consider "fall fish," uh,
or "scapefish" or even "fall bird,"

71
00:03:26,423 --> 00:03:27,506
and then we're back to Dee.

72
00:03:27,507 --> 00:03:29,301
Oh gosh, I'm so sorry guys,

73
00:03:31,345 --> 00:03:34,639
but my hand
is so tightly clenched into a claw.

74
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,224
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Same.

75
00:03:36,225 --> 00:03:38,434
- I'm feeling the claw again.
- Same.

76
00:03:38,435 --> 00:03:39,769
All right, so why don't we do this?

77
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:42,647
Let's all take a deep breath
before we continue this conversation.

78
00:03:42,648 --> 00:03:44,148
Unclaw our hands.

79
00:03:50,948 --> 00:03:51,949
I think Dee is right.

80
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:55,868
I think we got to take this mess from
the beginning to find out how we got here.

81
00:03:55,869 --> 00:03:57,787
- Uh-huh.
- Find out who's really to blame.

82
00:03:57,788 --> 00:04:00,082
Now, as you recall,
it all started several weeks ago...

83
00:04:01,667 --> 00:04:04,794
<i>...when Frank
found that jug out back.</i>

84
00:04:04,795 --> 00:04:06,420
Yo, let me blow on that.

85
00:04:06,421 --> 00:04:09,423
No, you make sounds when you bang on it,
not blow on it.

86
00:04:09,424 --> 00:04:11,092
- No, you blow on it.
- No, no. Yeah, yeah.

87
00:04:11,093 --> 00:04:13,261
It sounds different when you put water...

88
00:04:13,262 --> 00:04:15,471
- But it's gonna be much deeper, like--
- No, no, no. He's right.

89
00:04:15,472 --> 00:04:17,640
- You don't blow on it--
- If you blow on it like that it gets--

90
00:04:17,641 --> 00:04:19,308
You turn it upside-down--

91
00:04:19,309 --> 00:04:21,143
You don't bang on it--

92
00:04:21,144 --> 00:04:24,564
<i>That led to a vigorous debate
which in turn led to vigorous clawing</i>

93
00:04:24,565 --> 00:04:27,943
<i>until we decided to stop fighting
and, you know, simply get our own jugs.</i>

94
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:33,698
<i>Annoyingly, however,
the jugs were filled with fluid.</i>

95
00:04:33,699 --> 00:04:35,701
What are we supposed to do
with all this fluid?

96
00:04:36,326 --> 00:04:41,122
Uh... Yeah, can't really play them
as an instrument until we...

97
00:04:41,123 --> 00:04:42,540
- Oh.
- Yeah, that's a problem.

98
00:04:42,541 --> 00:04:44,917
We could... w-wash the bar with it.

99
00:04:44,918 --> 00:04:48,129
Uh, you don't wanna wash the bar
with a... with a water-based liquid.

100
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:49,714
- Make a fire and...
- Plants love that.

101
00:04:49,715 --> 00:04:51,674
- Make a fire and put water...
- Make a fire and put it out.

102
00:04:51,675 --> 00:04:53,634
What are you talking about?
We're not gonna make a fire.

103
00:04:53,635 --> 00:04:55,636
- Well, if we start a fire--
- Why would we start a fire?

104
00:04:55,637 --> 00:04:58,055
So we... so we have a reason
to use all this liquid.

105
00:04:58,056 --> 00:05:02,018
<i>After an hour-long argument about
the best way to dispose of the fluid,</i>

106
00:05:02,019 --> 00:05:04,478
<i>we caved and decided the best way
to make the jugs empty</i>

107
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:06,606
<i>was to simply drink the water.</i>

108
00:05:06,607 --> 00:05:10,318
Now if I'm braising something,
is that a way to cook something,

109
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:11,611
or is that shellacking it?

110
00:05:11,612 --> 00:05:12,945
Like, am I putting sauce on it?

111
00:05:12,946 --> 00:05:14,739
<i>The inadvertent effect
of the water cooler</i>

112
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:17,283
<i>was not just hydration, but conversation.</i>

113
00:05:17,284 --> 00:05:19,348
Is it about the sauce
or the cooking technique, or both?

114
00:05:19,349 --> 00:05:20,745
- It's about the crisping.
- About both.

115
00:05:20,746 --> 00:05:23,289
<i>The water tank became
a think tank for business scaffolding,</i>

116
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:26,584
<i>as well as recent health initiatives
and, you know, general interest.</i>

117
00:05:26,585 --> 00:05:30,671
Well, now I've taken
to using baby oil almost exclusively

118
00:05:30,672 --> 00:05:33,924
when I get out of the shower, you know,
I-I don't know if you guys know this,

119
00:05:33,925 --> 00:05:36,886
but you can actually put a tablespoon
of baby oil in your coffee in the morning

120
00:05:36,887 --> 00:05:39,314
and it resets the pH balance
of your gut biome.

121
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:40,640
You drink it?

122
00:05:40,641 --> 00:05:43,726
You know, if you're gonna dump stuff,
the best place is the ocean.

123
00:05:43,727 --> 00:05:47,355
I mean, you know, you in a pinch,
you go to a lake or a river,

124
00:05:47,356 --> 00:05:51,025
but you wanna get rid of something,
ocean is the only way to go.

125
00:05:51,026 --> 00:05:53,319
Dennis, how do they get
the oil out of the baby?

126
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:56,489
Do they have to mash the babies up
or grind them?

127
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:59,700
Is it babies that are sick
and dying already, or what is the oil--

128
00:05:59,701 --> 00:06:02,286
Don't be an idiot, Charlie.
The babies are alive.

129
00:06:02,287 --> 00:06:04,830
They just wring them out like an old rag.

130
00:06:04,831 --> 00:06:07,625
The Cybertruck
is by far the coolest piece of machinery

131
00:06:07,626 --> 00:06:09,418
that the space nerd has ever made. Right?

132
00:06:09,419 --> 00:06:10,920
- Absolutely.
- I love that truck.

133
00:06:10,921 --> 00:06:12,672
I'm furious
that all cars don't look like that.

134
00:06:12,673 --> 00:06:14,215
Dude, totally. You know what it is?

135
00:06:14,216 --> 00:06:16,342
It delivers on the promise
of the future from our youth.

136
00:06:16,343 --> 00:06:17,551
- Yes.
- Right?

137
00:06:17,552 --> 00:06:19,804
We thought all cars were going to look
like that back in the day.

138
00:06:19,805 --> 00:06:22,264
Hard lines, sharp corners,
DeLorean-like materials.

139
00:06:22,265 --> 00:06:24,892
Yeah, you know, it's the
transportation fitting of a Terminator.

140
00:06:24,893 --> 00:06:26,936
- Totally a Terminator.
- Yeah, absolutely.

141
00:06:26,937 --> 00:06:28,312
Yeah, it's like a rhombus on wheels.

142
00:06:28,313 --> 00:06:29,772
- Right, right. Absolutely.
- That's right.

143
00:06:29,773 --> 00:06:31,315
<i>We were firing on all cylinders,</i>

144
00:06:31,316 --> 00:06:35,569
<i>but things took a most exciting turn
when one particular topic was raised.</i>

145
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:37,781
Gentlemen,
what are your thoughts on slap fighting?

146
00:06:39,157 --> 00:06:42,159
Slap fighting? I'm not aware of this.

147
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,911
Oh. Well, let me tell you.

148
00:06:43,912 --> 00:06:46,914
Just like the Cybertruck
is the future of transportation,

149
00:06:46,915 --> 00:06:49,751
slap fighting
is the future of dispute mitigation.

150
00:06:51,962 --> 00:06:55,047
<i>And, my God, was he right.
We had to try our hand at it.</i>

151
00:06:55,048 --> 00:06:58,175
- The Egyptians, they like the cats.
- Yeah. They like them.

152
00:06:58,176 --> 00:07:01,053
I know, but it's a... it's a cat-based
society, you know what I mean?

153
00:07:01,054 --> 00:07:02,638
Yeah, but I understand that. But--

154
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:05,141
- The cats are a huge part of their thing.
- They like the cats.

155
00:07:05,142 --> 00:07:07,601
<i>Everybody loved it.
We swapped out the clawing for slapping.</i>

156
00:07:07,602 --> 00:07:09,728
<i>I mean, we were using it
to-to-to settle arguments.</i>

157
00:07:09,729 --> 00:07:12,106
<i>We were using it to end the day,
to start the day,</i>

158
00:07:12,107 --> 00:07:13,607
<i>to say goodbye, to say hello...</i>

159
00:07:13,608 --> 00:07:15,568
<i>...to celebrate, to mourn,
everything, you know.</i>

160
00:07:15,569 --> 00:07:19,239
<i>But then Mac had a business idea.</i>

161
00:07:21,158 --> 00:07:25,661
{\an8}Gentlemen, let's discuss
professional slap fighting.

162
00:07:27,831 --> 00:07:31,001
<i>We were all slapped across
the proverbial cheeks with this venture.</i>

163
00:07:34,421 --> 00:07:35,422
Take your shirts off, though.

164
00:07:38,058 --> 00:07:40,885
<i>Dennis] It was this hand-face-based
business venture</i>

165
00:07:40,886 --> 00:07:43,512
<i>that led to the off-lining
of certain corporate assets</i>

166
00:07:43,513 --> 00:07:45,514
<i>into various aquatic bodies.</i>

167
00:07:45,515 --> 00:07:51,103
So, Mac is clearly the prime candidate to
fall on the metaphorical sword here. Yes?

168
00:07:51,104 --> 00:07:53,355
- Yeah. Sounds good.
- Sure. Well, yeah. That adds up, right?

169
00:07:53,356 --> 00:07:55,774
Mm-hmm. That does seem to be
the proper mathing. Yes.

170
00:07:55,775 --> 00:07:57,485
Yeah, I do... I do hear you guys on this.

171
00:07:57,486 --> 00:07:59,945
As long as we're outside
of the earshot of this reporter,

172
00:07:59,946 --> 00:08:03,282
I'd like to add, you can stick this
line of logic up your various assholes.

173
00:08:04,367 --> 00:08:06,660
- All right, that's harsher language...
- Interesting point.

174
00:08:06,661 --> 00:08:08,787
...than I thought
we were allowed to use here, but...

175
00:08:08,788 --> 00:08:11,290
Also Dennis
is leaving out a core friction point.

176
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:12,791
<i>Things were going smoothly</i>

177
00:08:12,792 --> 00:08:16,545
<i>until Dennis pointed out that
the whole thing sorely lacked eroticism.</i>

178
00:08:16,546 --> 00:08:18,172
{\an8}Slaps and profits have gone up.

179
00:08:18,173 --> 00:08:19,673
{\an8}- That's great.
- Uh-huh.

180
00:08:19,674 --> 00:08:21,509
{\an8}But chick saturation has gone down.

181
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:23,177
- That's not good.
- Uh-uh.

182
00:08:23,178 --> 00:08:25,387
{\an8}The whole thing
is sorely lacking eroticism.

183
00:08:25,388 --> 00:08:27,681
{\an8}- The data is alarming.
- Yeah.

184
00:08:27,682 --> 00:08:29,934
- Yeah! Yeah, yeah.
- Well, let's fix that.

185
00:08:29,935 --> 00:08:31,018
- Go on.
- Yeah, yeah.

186
00:08:31,019 --> 00:08:33,437
<i>{\an8}He pitched something
with the eroticism of mud wrestling</i>

187
00:08:33,438 --> 00:08:34,980
<i>and the aggression of a Cybertruck.</i>

188
00:08:34,981 --> 00:08:36,899
{\an8}The world just has not delivered

189
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:39,985
{\an8}on the future that we were promised
when we were growing up.

190
00:08:39,986 --> 00:08:43,822
{\an8}We were promised mud wrestling.
We were promised wet T-shirt contests.

191
00:08:43,823 --> 00:08:45,991
{\an8}We were promised women going wild.

192
00:08:45,992 --> 00:08:48,744
{\an8}At a certain point,
we stopped women from going wild.

193
00:08:48,745 --> 00:08:49,870
{\an8}Why did we do that?

194
00:08:49,871 --> 00:08:52,081
{\an8}- They wanna go wild.
- They should go wild.

195
00:08:52,082 --> 00:08:55,501
{\an8}They want to go wild.
Let's let them go wild.

196
00:08:55,502 --> 00:08:59,046
{\an8}They're too dry,
and so they don't feel wild.

197
00:08:59,047 --> 00:09:02,049
{\an8}Yeah, exactly. Guys,
let's get back to our core values.

198
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:06,637
{\an8}Th-There is an underserved market
for one-on-one erotic sport competition

199
00:09:06,638 --> 00:09:09,431
{\an8}between scantily-clad, oiled-up women.

200
00:09:09,432 --> 00:09:11,350
<i>He proposed pivoting away from dudes</i>

201
00:09:11,351 --> 00:09:15,605
<i>and investing all of our resources
more heavily into women and baby oil.</i>

202
00:09:20,318 --> 00:09:25,114
This is why Dennis's head must roll.
I compliment him on the innovation,

203
00:09:25,115 --> 00:09:28,367
but the idea was a little chunky,
if I'm being honest.

204
00:09:28,368 --> 00:09:29,994
My personal distaste for women aside,

205
00:09:29,995 --> 00:09:31,871
I think you crapped the bed
on the execution.

206
00:09:31,872 --> 00:09:34,123
We were over-leveraged
in the baby oil department

207
00:09:34,124 --> 00:09:37,001
and subsequential
environmental what-have-yous

208
00:09:37,002 --> 00:09:40,421
from the off-lining have left us
in this particular situation.

209
00:09:40,422 --> 00:09:44,300
Which is why I nominate Dennis.
Right time, right skull.

210
00:09:44,301 --> 00:09:46,594
- I like it. I like it.
- I gotta say I'm impressed.

211
00:09:46,595 --> 00:09:48,387
You know, you're coming at me
open-kimono here,

212
00:09:48,388 --> 00:09:50,055
and I appreciate that, so kudos, you know.

213
00:09:50,056 --> 00:09:54,101
But I do think we need to helicopter up,
stretch the vantage point a little bit.

214
00:09:54,102 --> 00:09:56,186
I think we need
to chew on the key protein here,

215
00:09:56,187 --> 00:09:58,857
- which I believe to be Dee.
- Mmm.

216
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:02,868
<i>{\an8}With the women slappers in the bar,
we were thriving,</i>

217
00:10:02,928 --> 00:10:06,906
<i>{\an8}but we weren't quite reaching the erotic
escape velocity that I was hoping for.</i>

218
00:10:06,907 --> 00:10:10,701
{\an8}I mean... ...really, all it is
is there's one lingering problem
with the women.

219
00:10:10,702 --> 00:10:12,953
{\an8}- What? They're ugly.
- They're ugly.

220
00:10:12,954 --> 00:10:14,788
- I didn't wanna say it, but they are ugly.
- Yeah.

221
00:10:14,789 --> 00:10:16,248
{\an8}They're a bit gruff, aren't they?

222
00:10:16,249 --> 00:10:20,210
The big issue for me is you can't put
baby oil on any of these women, you know.

223
00:10:20,211 --> 00:10:21,295
They'll bite you.

224
00:10:21,296 --> 00:10:24,298
{\an8}I had one almost
bend my arm completely in half.

225
00:10:24,299 --> 00:10:27,718
{\an8}- I tried to put baby oil on her and she--
- I got pinned by her too, man.

226
00:10:27,719 --> 00:10:30,930
{\an8}Yeah, yeah. So you know,
like, chick saturation is up. That's good.

227
00:10:30,931 --> 00:10:33,807
{\an8}- But the attractive/oil saturation...
- It's way down, yeah.

228
00:10:33,808 --> 00:10:36,143
- It's way down.
- Way down. Why is that?

229
00:10:36,144 --> 00:10:38,896
{\an8}So, we need to find a way
to lure in hotter women.

230
00:10:38,897 --> 00:10:40,898
Yeah, that's all it is.
You know what I mean?

231
00:10:40,899 --> 00:10:42,149
{\an8}Anybody got any ideas?

232
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:45,110
{\an8}Back in the day when we were taking down
all the aluminum siding,

233
00:10:45,111 --> 00:10:47,947
{\an8}what are we gonna do
with all that asbestos that was left?

234
00:10:47,948 --> 00:10:49,865
{\an8}- We dumped it in the Schuylkill.
- Oh, you did?

235
00:10:49,866 --> 00:10:50,950
- Yeah.
- Okay.

236
00:10:50,951 --> 00:10:54,995
But, in order to get 'em to do it,
we lured 'em in with a Cadillac.

237
00:10:56,498 --> 00:10:57,915
That's what you gotta do with the women.

238
00:10:57,916 --> 00:10:59,625
- You think we get these gals a Cadillac...
- Yeah!

239
00:10:59,626 --> 00:11:01,919
...and we say, you know, "You win
a slap fight, you get a Cadillac"?

240
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,672
{\an8}- Everybody needs money.
- Wait.

241
00:11:04,339 --> 00:11:05,881
{\an8}I know exactly what we should do.

242
00:11:05,882 --> 00:11:08,468
Oh! I was thinking the same thing.

243
00:11:09,344 --> 00:11:11,471
{\an8}I doubt it.

244
00:11:16,685 --> 00:11:19,937
Look at this thing. Oh, man.
Frank, baby, this is quite the prize.

245
00:11:19,938 --> 00:11:22,279
- Yeah.
- Nicely done, Frank.

246
00:11:23,525 --> 00:11:25,025
- Look at the hard angles on this.
- Yeah.

247
00:11:25,026 --> 00:11:26,193
It's beautiful, man.

248
00:11:26,194 --> 00:11:29,113
<i>The Cybertruck lured in
a much sexier talent pool.</i>

249
00:11:29,114 --> 00:11:30,998
<i>We were really excited
about the quality of slapper,</i>

250
00:11:30,999 --> 00:11:34,451
<i>but there was one
that stood out above all the others.</i>

251
00:11:34,452 --> 00:11:36,061
<i>I mean, we couldn't take our eyes off her.</i>

252
00:11:36,062 --> 00:11:38,205
I can't wait to see the headlights on her.

253
00:11:38,205 --> 00:11:39,373
- Yeah!
- Yeah.

254
00:11:39,374 --> 00:11:41,083
Yeah. Well,
and you never will see 'em, Frank.

255
00:11:41,084 --> 00:11:43,544
Because there's only one single headlight.

256
00:11:43,545 --> 00:11:45,587
- It's a single headlight, yeah.
- [Frank Oh.

257
00:11:45,588 --> 00:11:48,132
<i>We couldn't give her away.
We had to have her.</i>

258
00:11:48,133 --> 00:11:51,385
<i>It wasn't long before we came up
with a plan to retain her for ourselves.</i>

259
00:11:51,386 --> 00:11:53,595
<i>We would just have
to win the slap contest, you know.</i>

260
00:11:53,596 --> 00:11:56,265
<i>We needed a ringer, someone
to tear through these waifish models</i>

261
00:11:56,266 --> 00:11:59,059
<i>and ensure the truck
would remain in our portfolio.</i>

262
00:12:00,854 --> 00:12:01,980
What are you guys doing?

263
00:12:29,466 --> 00:12:31,175
<i>Dee was
tearing through girls</i>

264
00:12:31,176 --> 00:12:32,885
<i>like a paper shredder
through company records.</i>

265
00:12:32,886 --> 00:12:35,721
<i>And we knew she would,
as I had explained it with a graph.</i>

266
00:12:35,722 --> 00:12:38,891
The lower the self-esteem, the harder
the slap. And Dee could take a hit too.

267
00:12:38,892 --> 00:12:40,809
Right? Years of getting
slapped around by Frank, right?

268
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:41,935
Yeah.

269
00:12:41,936 --> 00:12:43,103
Those were the days.

270
00:12:43,104 --> 00:12:45,356
- Oh, yeah. Better times.
- If say so, buddy. If you say so.

271
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:48,692
<i>She had it all
and she delivered slap after slap.</i>

272
00:12:48,693 --> 00:12:51,737
<i>Sexy women, aggressive violence,
futuristic trucks.</i>

273
00:12:51,738 --> 00:12:55,532
<i>Everything was going according to plan.
Till Dee got knocked out.</i>

274
00:12:57,911 --> 00:13:00,329
Dee, I thank you for your service.
I love you like a sister.

275
00:13:00,330 --> 00:13:01,622
Well, I am your sister.

276
00:13:01,623 --> 00:13:03,457
Well, you know,
familial ties notwithstanding.

277
00:13:03,458 --> 00:13:05,843
Uh, I think you kinda drained the kettle
on that one.

278
00:13:06,127 --> 00:13:07,336
And hey, you know, no offense,

279
00:13:07,337 --> 00:13:10,089
but I think you've proven yourself
to be pretty good at taking a fall.

280
00:13:11,299 --> 00:13:14,009
Guys, I know things are getting hot, okay?

281
00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:15,970
But I think we're styling
the wrong mannequin here.

282
00:13:16,763 --> 00:13:18,263
I would have won that competition

283
00:13:18,264 --> 00:13:20,974
if it wasn't for our associate deviating
from the business plan,

284
00:13:20,975 --> 00:13:22,435
and that would be Charlie.

285
00:13:23,019 --> 00:13:24,937
Oh. Uh... Wow.

286
00:13:24,938 --> 00:13:27,856
<i>He fell back on some old bad habits.</i>

287
00:13:27,857 --> 00:13:29,650
Fool.

288
00:13:30,735 --> 00:13:33,320
What's up?

289
00:13:33,321 --> 00:13:35,489
- What's going on? New car? I like it.
- Oh, God.

290
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:38,534
- Okay. What is this? Why are you here?
- Pretty sweet. Is that a Geo?

291
00:13:38,535 --> 00:13:40,410
Well, I got
a business opportunity for you.

292
00:13:40,411 --> 00:13:41,995
Oh, a business opportunity?

293
00:13:41,996 --> 00:13:43,413
- Yeah. Check this out.
- Oh, good.

294
00:13:43,414 --> 00:13:45,040
- Yeah, you're gonna like this.
- Great. I bet.

295
00:13:45,041 --> 00:13:46,917
We're doing these oiled-up
slap fights in the bar.

296
00:13:46,918 --> 00:13:48,001
Oiled-up slap fights?

297
00:13:48,002 --> 00:13:50,003
Yeah, we're oiling girls
and they're slapping each other.

298
00:13:50,004 --> 00:13:51,255
- You're oiling girls up?
- Yeah.

299
00:13:51,256 --> 00:13:53,173
So I could oil you
or you could oil yourself, but...

300
00:13:53,174 --> 00:13:55,717
Did you come here to ask me
if I want to get oiled by you?

301
00:13:55,718 --> 00:13:57,511
- Are you stalking me again?
- Yeah.

302
00:13:57,512 --> 00:14:02,057
{\an8}Stalking? Whoa. Since when did I ever
stalk you? No, that's not my thing.

303
00:14:02,058 --> 00:14:03,392
{\an8}- Flirting, maybe. But...
- Okay.

304
00:14:03,393 --> 00:14:04,685
Hey, look, you don't have to do it,

305
00:14:04,686 --> 00:14:07,521
but I will say that the winner
of the thing is gonna get a free truck,

306
00:14:07,522 --> 00:14:10,608
but I suppose you like this car better,
you know.

307
00:14:11,985 --> 00:14:13,027
You're giving away a truck?

308
00:14:14,362 --> 00:14:15,363
A Cybertruck.

309
00:14:17,674 --> 00:14:20,909
<i>Little did he know that
she wasn't just driving that crappy car,</i>

310
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:22,369
<i>she was living in it.</i>

311
00:14:30,795 --> 00:14:32,254
<i>The allure of the Cybertruck</i>

312
00:14:32,255 --> 00:14:35,090
<i>and a lifetime of petty misery
suffered by this woman</i>

313
00:14:35,091 --> 00:14:36,717
<i>rendered her unstoppable.</i>

314
00:14:36,718 --> 00:14:39,929
Yeah. Okay. Who's next?

315
00:14:41,806 --> 00:14:44,433
Uh... Hey. I got an idea, all right?

316
00:14:44,434 --> 00:14:47,561
W-What if you and I get a little
side pot going, right?

317
00:14:47,562 --> 00:14:50,439
You and me, we... we tone down
on the slaps, we call it a tie,

318
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,982
and that way we can share the Cyber--

319
00:15:03,286 --> 00:15:04,494
Yeah!

320
00:15:04,495 --> 00:15:05,829
I was sucker-punched.

321
00:15:05,830 --> 00:15:08,624
- No.
- No.
- Mm-mmm.
- In your dreams.

322
00:15:08,625 --> 00:15:09,917
No. You were looking right at her.

323
00:15:09,918 --> 00:15:12,378
She slapped the shit out of me,
but I wasn't ready.

324
00:15:12,378 --> 00:15:14,254
It was uncalled for
and it wasn't fair.

325
00:15:14,255 --> 00:15:16,048
<i>To make matters worse,
Frank reversed course</i>

326
00:15:16,049 --> 00:15:17,716
<i>and refused to make her whole.</i>

327
00:15:17,717 --> 00:15:19,092
What do you mean I don't get the truck?

328
00:15:19,093 --> 00:15:21,845
{\an8}- It's all in the terms and conditions.
- What?

329
00:15:21,846 --> 00:15:24,848
Look. "Cybertruck not included."
Can you read?

330
00:15:24,849 --> 00:15:27,309
- Oh, my God!
- Can you read?

331
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:28,393
- What?
- Oh, my God.

332
00:15:28,394 --> 00:15:30,604
- Screw you. Screw you guys so hard!
- In plain writing.

333
00:15:30,605 --> 00:15:32,731
- Oh, I'm taking this public. For this.
- Don't you dare.

334
00:15:32,732 --> 00:15:35,359
<i>Needless to say, she was pissed,
and she promised to go public.</i>

335
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,402
<i>And let's face it,
we didn't have permits for any of this.</i>

336
00:15:37,403 --> 00:15:39,696
<i>Which led to the panic
and dumping of assets</i>

337
00:15:39,697 --> 00:15:42,866
<i>to erase the trail of corporate culture
and create plausible deniability.</i>

338
00:15:42,867 --> 00:15:44,117
I'm gonna call the newspaper.

339
00:15:44,118 --> 00:15:46,745
As the crow flies here, I think
we could all see from a bird's-eye view

340
00:15:46,746 --> 00:15:48,246
that had Charlie not invited the Waitress,

341
00:15:48,247 --> 00:15:50,499
none of this would've happened.
So Charlie should take the fall.

342
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,542
And I would say all due respect,
but I don't respect you.

343
00:15:52,543 --> 00:15:55,420
It's true, Charlie.
We may have reached our inflection point.

344
00:15:55,421 --> 00:15:57,381
Okay, great. Yeah, that's all good. Yeah.

345
00:15:57,382 --> 00:15:59,925
And I-I'm hearing you guys,
you know, ear-wise.

346
00:15:59,926 --> 00:16:04,012
And, um, you know, mouth-wise, uh,
you're giving me various wordables,

347
00:16:04,013 --> 00:16:05,847
uh, that are adding up to thoughts.

348
00:16:05,848 --> 00:16:08,809
This is good. I see how you're trying
to clip my wings so that I can fly.

349
00:16:08,810 --> 00:16:11,103
That's not how birds work.
That makes them "un-fly."

350
00:16:11,104 --> 00:16:13,438
Okay. I did not know that
you were the bird expert.

351
00:16:13,439 --> 00:16:16,733
But I would like to pivot here.
You know, before I fall on the sword

352
00:16:16,734 --> 00:16:21,655
and say that I was also using my eyeballs
this entire time for various observables.

353
00:16:21,656 --> 00:16:27,119
{\an8}Because I realized...
...that Frank was, you know,

354
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:30,622
{\an8}growing in hardness as the eroticism
in the bar was increasing.

355
00:16:30,623 --> 00:16:33,750
And, uh, he was becoming
as hard as a Cybertruck himself,

356
00:16:33,751 --> 00:16:34,835
you know, which you could see.

357
00:16:34,836 --> 00:16:36,753
{\an8}Cheese, of course, is also on this graph.

358
00:16:36,754 --> 00:16:38,380
- Just keep going.
- Uh, moving past.

359
00:16:38,381 --> 00:16:42,968
Well, the main thing here is that I think
we now have our open sliced lamb.

360
00:16:42,969 --> 00:16:45,137
You know, open commando person.

361
00:16:45,138 --> 00:16:47,556
- What?
- What are you saying?

362
00:16:47,557 --> 00:16:48,932
I'm saying it should be Frank, man.

363
00:16:48,933 --> 00:16:51,977
Because he was throwing an orgy
in the basement the entire time.

364
00:16:51,978 --> 00:16:53,603
- What?
- Yes.

365
00:16:53,604 --> 00:16:56,815
I realized Frank was trying
to capitalize on the erotic environment

366
00:16:56,816 --> 00:16:59,693
and pivot into
a more orgasmic business model, right?

367
00:16:59,694 --> 00:17:04,322
<i>And I noticed various unsavory
investors were paying Frank</i>

368
00:17:04,323 --> 00:17:06,700
<i>to try to get in on the ground floor.</i>

369
00:17:06,701 --> 00:17:08,201
Dear God. Damn, you are not good at this.

370
00:17:08,202 --> 00:17:10,328
I'm tryna say dudes were paying Frank
to go into the basement.

371
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:11,496
- Mm-hmm.
- Right.

372
00:17:11,497 --> 00:17:14,291
And he was failing in his efforts
to poach talent from the slapping pool.

373
00:17:14,292 --> 00:17:19,046
Ooh. I like those straps and I can't wait
to see it off. Let's go downstairs.

374
00:17:19,047 --> 00:17:21,715
And I knew this 'cause chicks
were slapping him constantly.

375
00:17:21,716 --> 00:17:26,094
But then I saw him trying to headhunt
for new key players in this thing.

376
00:17:26,095 --> 00:17:29,765
Yo, baby. I need a prostitute.

377
00:17:29,766 --> 00:17:32,267
<i>But he was running up
against some logistical hurdles.</i>

378
00:17:32,268 --> 00:17:34,311
Well, when's she coming back
from The Bahamas?

379
00:17:34,312 --> 00:17:36,438
<i>So, the slap fighting
and the basement full of men.</i>

380
00:17:36,439 --> 00:17:39,524
<i>The whole thing was just a big red flag.
He had a target on his back and whatnot.</i>

381
00:17:39,525 --> 00:17:43,779
So, when The Waitress got all pissed off...
She wasn't gonna get a Cybertruck,

382
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:46,948
and the police were potentially
going to get involved, Frank panicked.

383
00:17:46,949 --> 00:17:48,950
He was worried about the orgy,

384
00:17:48,951 --> 00:17:51,870
which led to the dumping
into the Schuylkills and whatnot.

385
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:56,792
And so that is why he is the person
that... that should take this fall.

386
00:17:56,793 --> 00:17:59,544
Um, also, there's still
a bunch of dudes in the basement.

387
00:17:59,545 --> 00:18:00,962
- Uh... What? Right now?
- What?

388
00:18:00,963 --> 00:18:02,422
Yeah, there's, like, guys down there now.

389
00:18:02,423 --> 00:18:03,799
- Dude.
- Right? How many are down there?

390
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:06,134
- Eleven. Eleven. Eleven's the answer.
- Eleven dudes in the basement.

391
00:18:06,135 --> 00:18:08,557
- The reporter could see all this.
- Yeah, one could come up.

392
00:18:08,557 --> 00:18:09,930
- It could be an issue for us.
- Oh, shit.

393
00:18:09,931 --> 00:18:12,391
We got to figure out what we're gonna do
and get her out of here.

394
00:18:12,392 --> 00:18:15,060
I agree with Charlie. I think Frank
should take the fall for the whole thing.

395
00:18:15,061 --> 00:18:17,396
- Well, that's insane.
- You drove a Cybertruck into the river.

396
00:18:17,397 --> 00:18:19,648
I didn't know.
I thought it was an aquatic vehicle.

397
00:18:19,649 --> 00:18:21,817
- It's an environmental nightmare.
- It should be, but it's not.

398
00:18:21,818 --> 00:18:23,443
If anything,
it looks like it goes into space.

399
00:18:23,444 --> 00:18:26,196
- Yeah, it should be but it's not.
- The liberal press is going to crucify us.

400
00:18:26,197 --> 00:18:27,323
I gotta come clean.

401
00:18:28,266 --> 00:18:29,866
I think the truck is ugly.

402
00:18:29,867 --> 00:18:32,619
Damn it. I knew you were gonna say that.
I knew she was gonna say that.

403
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:36,039
Stupid. You're stupid.
I call bullshit on that.

404
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,707
All right. Enough, enough.

405
00:18:37,708 --> 00:18:40,710
I've had enough with the charts
and the maps and the graphs.

406
00:18:40,711 --> 00:18:44,256
It's clear you're all good foot soldiers,
loyal servants and whatnot.

407
00:18:44,257 --> 00:18:49,386
But it's time we connect the Legos here
and boil down to our core values.

408
00:18:49,387 --> 00:18:53,223
Yes, hammer down on our brand identity
and come out open commando.

409
00:18:53,224 --> 00:18:55,350
- I said the commando thing.
- Didn't make sense the first time.

410
00:18:55,351 --> 00:18:57,477
I thought it was... It sounded cool
and I want to circle back.

411
00:18:57,478 --> 00:19:00,815
- Oh, if you're doing it 'cause it's cool...
- Okay. I got a plan, and this is it.

412
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:04,067
Okay. Here we go.

413
00:19:05,153 --> 00:19:08,071
Um, ma'am, we are finally ready
to make our statement.

414
00:19:08,072 --> 00:19:09,531
Yeah, yeah.

415
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,493
No comment.

416
00:19:13,494 --> 00:19:18,915
That said, we are no longer gonna
drink, serve, or have anything to do

417
00:19:18,916 --> 00:19:20,333
- that represents water.
- Yeah.

418
00:19:20,334 --> 00:19:23,086
Water is not the cornerstone
of our company.

419
00:19:23,087 --> 00:19:25,213
And we will hereby be getting rid
of the water cooler.

420
00:19:25,214 --> 00:19:26,298
- Gone.
- Gone.

421
00:19:26,299 --> 00:19:28,925
Excuse me, I-I'm not sure
what you're talking about.

422
00:19:28,926 --> 00:19:32,220
Sorry. We got on talking like this
when we started over-hydrating.

423
00:19:32,221 --> 00:19:34,806
Yeah, we watched a couple YouTube clips
about a corporate retreat.

424
00:19:34,807 --> 00:19:36,308
Got some water, got hydrated.

425
00:19:36,309 --> 00:19:38,393
So, we're not gonna talk
about that subject anymore.

426
00:19:38,394 --> 00:19:40,520
- No more water.
- No comment is the main thing, right?

427
00:19:40,521 --> 00:19:42,731
- Yeah. What I said in the beginning.
- Yeah. And no water.

428
00:19:42,732 --> 00:19:44,767
I'm sorry, do you think I'm a reporter?

429
00:19:45,401 --> 00:19:46,651
Yeah.

430
00:19:46,652 --> 00:19:49,030
No. I'm here for the orgy.

431
00:19:51,491 --> 00:19:53,867
Good. Great. Great.

432
00:19:53,868 --> 00:19:56,871
Oh. Hey, guys, the whore is here.

433
00:19:59,081 --> 00:20:02,417
- I was waiting for you.
- I told you guys, man.

434
00:20:02,418 --> 00:20:04,252
- That's one woman.
- Yeah.

435
00:20:04,253 --> 00:20:06,671
Yeah. T-That's not an orgy. That's a...

436
00:20:06,672 --> 00:20:09,216
- That's a gangbang.
