1
00:00:09,134 --> 00:00:11,636
<i>So, as you may recall,
a little while back</i>

2
00:00:11,637 --> 00:00:13,387
<i>we had some volunteers at the school.</i>

3
00:00:13,388 --> 00:00:15,556
Found out they were here
for community service.

4
00:00:15,557 --> 00:00:16,641
I wasn't tripping.

5
00:00:16,642 --> 00:00:18,851
Four days, free labor
and they were outta here.

6
00:00:18,852 --> 00:00:21,938
But we were alerted to some
additional footage, if you will.

7
00:00:21,939 --> 00:00:25,024
Turns out these clowns were up
to a lot more than we knew.

8
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:26,734
<i>Welcome to Abbott Elementary,</i>

9
00:00:26,735 --> 00:00:28,444
<i>the best elementary school
in the universe.</i>

10
00:00:28,445 --> 00:00:30,238
<i>What's the deal with all the cameras?</i>

11
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:32,031
<i>We have, like,
a Vanderpump thing going on.</i>

12
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:33,158
- Don't worry about it.
- No!

13
00:00:33,742 --> 00:00:37,072
No. I think I'll be spending my time
on the other side of the camera.
Thank you very much.

14
00:00:37,072 --> 00:00:38,996
- Yeah, okay.
- Totally get that.

15
00:00:40,282 --> 00:00:43,793
If Caucasian Cultural Exchange is over,
let's get to the free work.

16
00:00:43,794 --> 00:00:44,877
You got it.

17
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:49,340
Before we do that,
could my associates and I talk?

18
00:00:49,341 --> 00:00:50,424
If you wanna talk, talk.

19
00:00:50,425 --> 00:00:53,169
In private. I mean, away from the...

20
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:54,947
- Yeah. That's an issue.
- The cameras. Yeah.

21
00:00:54,947 --> 00:00:56,389
- Yeah.
- If we could just not be near those.

22
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:59,016
- It'll only take a second.
- Frank, just go...
- Go?
- Yeah.

23
00:00:59,017 --> 00:01:01,352
Yeah. We'll be right... Yeah.
We'll be right back.

24
00:01:01,353 --> 00:01:03,562
- Yeah, of course.
- We'll roam around your school.

25
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:05,106
- Yeah.
- Just need a minute.

26
00:01:05,107 --> 00:01:07,234
- What are we doing?
- Go, go, go. Go.

27
00:01:08,235 --> 00:01:09,694
Close that door and lock it.

28
00:01:09,695 --> 00:01:11,946
- Okay. I got an idea.
- Frank,

29
00:01:11,947 --> 00:01:13,322
let's not make this a whole thing, please.

30
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:15,324
- Just a quick in and out.
- The faster we get it done - the better.

31
00:01:15,325 --> 00:01:17,076
- I see an opportunity here.

32
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:18,494
How's a school an opportunity?

33
00:01:18,495 --> 00:01:23,174
It's not just a school.
It's a gold mine.

34
00:01:23,559 --> 00:01:25,877
I can't believe these shitheads forgot
they were mic'd.

35
00:01:26,371 --> 00:01:29,132
ABBOTT

36
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:51,610
{\an8}- How is a school a gold mine?
- Copper piping.

37
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:53,613
{\an8}Thousands and thousands of yards of it.

38
00:01:54,281 --> 00:01:56,574
{\an8}And this is an old building.
They use the thick kind.

39
00:01:56,575 --> 00:01:58,977
I mean, a fence would pay a fortune
for that stuff.

40
00:01:58,977 --> 00:02:01,995
- Frank.
We're not ripping copper piping
out of a public school.

41
00:02:01,995 --> 00:02:04,832
- Well, why not?
The city's gonna make 'em do it anyway.

42
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:07,293
And they're gonna wind up paying for it.
We'd be doing them a favor.

43
00:02:07,294 --> 00:02:09,170
Okay. Stop, stop.
We're not doing this, all right?

44
00:02:09,171 --> 00:02:11,297
We're just...
We're gonna get through the day. Okay?

45
00:02:11,298 --> 00:02:13,508
And then we're gonna
get the hell out of here. Because I...

46
00:02:14,301 --> 00:02:17,094
Oh, my God. This coffee is sludge.

47
00:02:17,095 --> 00:02:19,096
What's the story on the snacks?
Are these free or what?

48
00:02:19,097 --> 00:02:21,599
Guys, I'm with Dennis.
If I could just get this release signed,

49
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,851
then we could be outta here
in a week. All right?

50
00:02:23,852 --> 00:02:25,686
Look, I don't wanna get lice
from one of these kids.

51
00:02:25,687 --> 00:02:27,856
Did you guys know
that Black people can't get lice?

52
00:02:28,357 --> 00:02:31,776
- Dee, that's, like, crazy racist.
- No, no, no. That's just science.

53
00:02:31,777 --> 00:02:33,152
It's the lice who are racist.

54
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:34,737
- All right. Hold on, hold on.
- Racist lice?

55
00:02:34,738 --> 00:02:37,657
You hear this conversation?
This is us digging a deeper hole.

56
00:02:37,658 --> 00:02:39,659
Let's please not do it.
I'm begging you all.

57
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:42,453
Why is this door locked?
And who are you people?

58
00:02:42,454 --> 00:02:43,913
Oh, hi. We're your volunteers.

59
00:02:43,914 --> 00:02:46,457
You're not supposed to be in here.
This is the teachers' lounge.

60
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:48,125
Ah. Then where's the volunteers' lounge?

61
00:02:48,126 --> 00:02:49,794
Actually, um, question. Sorry.

62
00:02:49,795 --> 00:02:51,796
Are you in charge
of cleaning the coffee pots?

63
00:02:51,797 --> 00:02:55,257
Because, um, they're really dirty
and you're not doing a good job.

64
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:56,510
What is this?

65
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:58,844
- Quit eating that.
- Yeah. Quit eating that.

66
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:01,055
I'm not...
I thought it was free. It's not free?

67
00:03:01,056 --> 00:03:03,140
- Y'all get the hell out of here.
- Get the hell out of here.

68
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:05,142
- Get out of here. He said.
- I thought they were free.

69
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:07,228
- Get the hell out of here. You know?
- Okay. All right.

70
00:03:07,229 --> 00:03:09,480
- It's just a misunderstanding. Probably.
- No.

71
00:03:09,481 --> 00:03:11,565
Guy's gonna be a problem.
Take care of him.

72
00:03:11,566 --> 00:03:14,068
I can't say I'm surprised by any of this.

73
00:03:14,069 --> 00:03:17,321
I mean, I liked Dee at first, but things
got awkward when she tried to steal you.

74
00:03:17,322 --> 00:03:18,406
That was never gonna happen.

75
00:03:18,407 --> 00:03:20,825
Still. Safe to say
I liked her less after that.

76
00:03:20,826 --> 00:03:23,369
But it wasn't
until I saw the extra footage

77
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:27,039
that I was able to realize
just how much of a...

78
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,625
Mmm. I need to say a bad word.

79
00:03:29,418 --> 00:03:30,501
- It's okay. Yeah.
- Yeah?

80
00:03:30,502 --> 00:03:32,586
- I'm gonna. It's real bad.
- We talked about this. Go ahead.

81
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:36,215
How much of a total fucking cunt she was.

82
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:38,384
I... I thought
you was gonna call her a bitch.

83
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:40,928
- No. I didn't feel that was strong enough.
- Okay.

84
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:44,057
Bitch can be a very fine dog.
That is not what this woman is.

85
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:48,561
Class, could I have your attention
for one second?

86
00:03:48,562 --> 00:03:51,397
You are being taught by a genius.

87
00:03:51,398 --> 00:03:55,818
And class, if I may,
you have a genius volunteer aiding you.

88
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,905
- You. You.
- You.

89
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:01,282
- No, you.
- It's definitely you.

90
00:04:01,283 --> 00:04:03,160
- Right now. One, two, three. You.
- You.

91
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:08,873
Back up. Go. Go out there.
Go out there. Go out there.

92
00:04:08,874 --> 00:04:11,417
Okay. I notice you following
that one around a bunch?

93
00:04:11,418 --> 00:04:14,336
What is going on with that?
I'm not picking up star vibes from her.

94
00:04:14,337 --> 00:04:15,671
She's a dud. She's a giant dud.

95
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:18,090
But I have an idea: You follow me around,

96
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:21,594
make me the star of whatever this is,
and I will make this shit pop. Right?

97
00:04:21,595 --> 00:04:24,472
I'll steal her man.
I'll expose her for the dud she is.

98
00:04:24,473 --> 00:04:26,600
What do you think? Let's work together.

99
00:04:28,769 --> 00:04:29,977
- Hey.
- Hey.

100
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:32,480
- We can't wait till you come back.
- I can't wait to come back.

101
00:04:33,774 --> 00:04:35,150
Oh, my God.

102
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:39,612
I mean, what is she talking about?
The star of the thing? What?

103
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:42,364
- I don't know. She's crazy. It's a-- Yeah.
- She really is crazy.

104
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:44,366
- If anything, Ava's the star.
- Mmm.

105
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:47,536
Maybe Barb. Could be me at this point.

106
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:49,497
- But you know...
- Sure. Yeah.

107
00:04:49,498 --> 00:04:50,582
Sure?

108
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:53,959
- You don't think I've gotten--
- No. No. No, absolutely.

109
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,044
- You're the star.
- The focus...

110
00:04:55,045 --> 00:04:57,129
They kind of go through
my interpretation of it.

111
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:58,923
- Yeah. It's for you. Yeah.
- Okay.

112
00:04:58,924 --> 00:05:00,549
Well, actually,
that's not what this is about.

113
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:02,427
- 'Cause it's about the kids.
- Exactly.

114
00:05:03,053 --> 00:05:07,432
But the good news is she was never
actually attracted to Gregory at all.

115
00:05:10,352 --> 00:05:11,353
Sorry.

116
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,522
She should've been. No.

117
00:05:15,482 --> 00:05:18,275
These dumbasses couldn't even pretend
to volunteer for very long.

118
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:21,112
Day one, they tried to recruit athletes
for their old high school.

119
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:23,740
Yo.

120
00:05:24,241 --> 00:05:27,576
Hey, dude. Pfft.
This place is the worst, man.

121
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:29,912
They're, like, totally, like,
trying to teach me to read and stuff.

122
00:05:29,913 --> 00:05:32,957
And I'm just, like, playing along
and being like, "Oh.
You know. You can help me."

123
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:35,251
But it's just like I'm trying
to kill time, you know?

124
00:05:35,252 --> 00:05:37,213
- Like, it's so boring. Yeah.
- Yeah. Yeah. Uh-huh.
- Sure.

125
00:05:37,213 --> 00:05:38,337
- What do they got you doing?

126
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:41,048
Uh, well, they don't really
have me doing anything,

127
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:42,508
but I decided to do this.

128
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:44,134
Oh. What... What is this?

129
00:05:44,135 --> 00:05:46,804
Well, I... I grabbed a bunch of
stuff from the science class...

130
00:05:46,805 --> 00:05:48,889
Uh-huh.
- ...and I'm doing a science experiment here.

131
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:50,599
- Is it coffee?
- It is coffee.

132
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,684
I could smell it.

133
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:53,310
It's the most amazing coffee
you've ever had.

134
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:55,187
- You wouldn't believe it.
- Dude, sick. Give me a cup.

135
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:56,355
- I'm like Walter White over here.
- Yeah, absolutely.

136
00:05:56,425 --> 00:05:58,774
- Hey, guys.
- You want this one? It's ready to go.

137
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:01,694
You would not believe the bozos
they got as the stars of this thing.

138
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:03,195
- Stars of what thing?
- Yeah.

139
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:05,739
Their reality show or whatever it is
they got going.

140
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:07,157
- Oh, shit.
- Oh, shit.

141
00:06:07,158 --> 00:06:09,159
- I keep forgetting about these guys.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

142
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,662
- Yeah, me too.
- I'm gonna use it as a launching pad.

143
00:06:11,663 --> 00:06:13,689
- I got an angle.
- No, no, no. We're not doing angles, Dee.

144
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:15,499
- What smells good?
- Coffee. You gotta try it.

145
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,750
- Make her one.
- You want one?

146
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:18,068
- This is a coffee? Yeah.
- Yeah.

147
00:06:18,069 --> 00:06:19,962
It's really slow,
so I'll make you a small one.

148
00:06:19,963 --> 00:06:21,797
- Raccoon on the loose.
- What?

149
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:23,465
- Really?
- Hey, hey. Frank, Frank.

150
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:25,927
Yeah. I bought a racoon in
to keep that janitor busy.

151
00:06:26,428 --> 00:06:28,554
- Coffee me, huh?
- Nice, dude. Good move.

152
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:30,139
- Yeah.
- No, no. Frank, cameras.

153
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:33,684
- Yo. What's up, bitches?
Have you guys seen the talent
in this school?

154
00:06:33,685 --> 00:06:36,437
No. No. What are you...
We're just doing the one thing, okay?

155
00:06:36,438 --> 00:06:38,397
You guys are talking
about five different things.

156
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:39,982
For Christ's sake,
you're all over the place.

157
00:06:39,983 --> 00:06:41,400
What talent? What you talking about?

158
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:43,110
Yeah. There's kids, like,
that are taller than me.

159
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:45,613
I say we recruit one
for the basketball team at St. Joe's.

160
00:06:45,614 --> 00:06:47,031
- No, no, no.
- Dude. Great idea, man.

161
00:06:47,032 --> 00:06:50,242
- They've been sucking ass, bro.
- We are just doing the one thing. Okay?

162
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:52,745
I want a... I want a straight line
to Friday. That's it.

163
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:54,705
- Okay. All right.
- He needs a coffee.

164
00:06:54,706 --> 00:06:56,457
Yeah. Get him some coffee, man.
Make a coffee for...

165
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:57,833
- Coffee, coffee.
- Mac, try a coffee.

166
00:06:57,834 --> 00:06:59,418
- Yeah. I'll have a coffee.
- It's really good.

167
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:01,920
- It's perfectly pH-balanced.
- I keep forgetting about the cameras, man.

168
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:04,674
- I forget about them every time, dude.
- Shit. Yeah.

169
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:08,927
It is easy to forget about the cameras.

170
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:11,263
I keep cash on me
to make things "go away."

171
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:12,723
But they took it to the next level.

172
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:19,938
That's a good idea. Totally profit
off a young basketball player.

173
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:21,982
<i>Like, pull a Blind Side on 'em.</i>

174
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:24,193
- Are you pissing in that locker?
- Oh, it's the coffee.

175
00:07:24,194 --> 00:07:26,904
- I... I drank so much coffee. Yeah.
- It goes right through you, yeah.

176
00:07:26,905 --> 00:07:28,280
<i>Let's do the Blind Side thing.</i>

177
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:30,695
Well, yeah. But I think
we're not supposed to say "blind side,"

178
00:07:30,695 --> 00:07:33,994
It got frowned upon, 'cause...
It was, like, a white savior thing.

179
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:36,279
And I think white people aren't supposed
to help Black people anymore. Right?

180
00:07:36,279 --> 00:07:38,413
No. That's a misunderstanding.
- Okay, good.

181
00:07:38,413 --> 00:07:41,710
- Yeah. You see,
St. Joe's is predominantly white teams,
so we're helping the basketball team.

182
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:43,962
We're helping a white school,
so it's fine.

183
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:46,715
- Look at that one. He's tall.
- Don't say "that one." I know that much.

184
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:48,885
- Let's go get him. Let's go get him.
- I meant that Black kid.

185
00:07:51,096 --> 00:07:54,139
Hey, kid. Look at you. Wow.

186
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:56,317
Wow, man. We saw you in the hall.

187
00:07:56,318 --> 00:07:58,644
- We liked everything we saw.
- We did.

188
00:07:58,645 --> 00:08:00,187
What's it gonna take to convince you

189
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:02,356
to leave a place like this
and come with us?

190
00:08:02,357 --> 00:08:04,400
We may have access to a Lexus
if you wanna joyride.

191
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:06,026
- You like joyriding?
- Vroom, vroom.

192
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:12,658
What is this? What is going on here?

193
00:08:12,659 --> 00:08:15,619
Uh... Well...

194
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:16,996
He... He left. Yeah.

195
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:19,290
Okay, you need to leave too.

196
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:21,458
What the...

197
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:23,128
Poor Rodney. He was really freaked out.

198
00:08:23,628 --> 00:08:26,171
Maybe it was Jacob interrupting them,
or maybe it was when they found out

199
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:29,633
that Rodney is legally blind in one eye
and can't shoot for shit.

200
00:08:29,634 --> 00:08:31,594
Don't think we didn't try. He's trash.

201
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:34,806
A basketball recruit? Oh, thank God.

202
00:08:36,158 --> 00:08:38,393
My mind was going to terrible places.

203
00:08:39,845 --> 00:08:42,604
Anyway, they got off that idea
and bounced to the next one

204
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:44,315
like one of those ADHD kids.

205
00:08:44,816 --> 00:08:47,610
The only thing I will say is,
their coffee was fantastic.

206
00:08:49,446 --> 00:08:53,490
Okay. Got a soy almond latte for Gregory.
There we go.

207
00:08:53,491 --> 00:08:55,993
- Much obliged.
- Okay. And Janine. You have the...

208
00:08:55,994 --> 00:08:58,370
Yeah. it was a mocha grande half-caf
with a splash of--

209
00:08:58,371 --> 00:08:59,705
- A splash of vanilla.
- Yes.

210
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:01,415
Okay. I got you right here.

211
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:03,876
- There we go. Enjoy. Enjoy.
- Thanks. Okay. Thank you.

212
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:06,378
Katie, I remember you.

213
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:07,839
Super complicated order.

214
00:09:08,923 --> 00:09:12,384
I gotta say, guys. This experience
is not as bad as I thought it would be.

215
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:13,427
Yeah. It's fine, you know.

216
00:09:13,428 --> 00:09:15,471
I mean, for once,
laying low is maybe paying off for us.

217
00:09:15,472 --> 00:09:17,306
No, no, no. Screw laying low.

218
00:09:17,307 --> 00:09:19,558
I'm making a play
for dingbat's guy, and it's working.

219
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:21,810
- No. Dee, I said no angles. What're you...
- Excuse me.

220
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:25,856
Guys, excuse me. I'm volunteering,
so I have to come through here. Yeah.

221
00:09:25,857 --> 00:09:28,734
Yeah. Yeah, they said
that the volunteers had to come through.

222
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:32,905
'Cause we wouldn't normally do that.
We're good people. But we had to. So...

223
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:34,074
What, bro? What?

224
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:38,118
Guys, I'm actually, like, really pissed
at this school.

225
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:40,662
Like, they have no idea
how to teach people, you know? Like--

226
00:09:40,663 --> 00:09:43,040
- What, you not learning to read?
- No. It's not the reading.

227
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:45,084
I know how to read. It's 9/11, man.

228
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:47,628
- What-What-What?
- What about 9/11?
Yeah?

229
00:09:47,629 --> 00:09:49,463
The kids
don't know anything about it, man.

230
00:09:49,464 --> 00:09:51,216
- They don't know what it is.
- What?

231
00:09:52,217 --> 00:09:55,719
I heard a couple of 'em joking, and they
were sharing funny, like, Internet memes.

232
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:58,430
And they were, like, "Oh, yeah. Oh, that?
I know that Internet joke thing."

233
00:09:58,431 --> 00:09:59,556
No.

234
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:01,433
- That's how they know it.
- Okay. Hold on a second. I...

235
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:03,352
Well now I have to get involved,
'cause that's insane.

236
00:10:03,353 --> 00:10:04,728
- Yeah, that's kids these days.
- Huh?

237
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:06,897
- 9/11 is just one giant meme to them.
- Yeah, it's a big joke.

238
00:10:06,898 --> 00:10:09,274
- It is?
- Yeah. It's like Pearl Harbor.

239
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:12,861
I mean, you know, that happens.
Everybody looks the other way.

240
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:15,155
Now we're all buying Japanese cars.

241
00:10:15,156 --> 00:10:17,324
And now the Arabs are buying golf from us.

242
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:19,076
- What?
- Golf's not for sale, dude.

243
00:10:19,077 --> 00:10:20,702
The purest sport
in the history of humanity?

244
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:22,329
- What's next, football?
- Wait a minute.

245
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:24,915
- I mean, what happened to "never forget"?
- We said we weren't gonna forget.

246
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:26,291
We made an agreement to never forget.

247
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:28,335
We collectively made an agreement
to never forget.

248
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:30,712
Next thing you know, now the camps...
And just buying whatever car we want?

249
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:33,465
- I mean, what the hell is this?
- We're just forgetting what happened?

250
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:35,175
This argument went on for way too long.

251
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:37,803
I remember every goddamn one
of those attackers' names.

252
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:39,388
- Every goddamn one.
- Of course you do.

253
00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:40,848
- Mohamed Atta.
- That guy!

254
00:10:40,849 --> 00:10:42,766
- Marwan al-Shehhi!
- Ziad Jarrah!

255
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:45,394
Bin Laden! He died like the dog
in the dirt that he was, man!

256
00:10:45,395 --> 00:10:47,187
- That's right, goddamn it.
- That's where he belongs.

257
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:50,190
- The fallen fire department!
- Gonna forget about the firefighters?

258
00:10:52,443 --> 00:10:54,945
These people were passionate,
but dumb as shit.

259
00:10:54,946 --> 00:10:57,865
'Cause at some point they argued
themselves right into conspiracy theories.

260
00:10:57,866 --> 00:11:01,285
- So it had to be a hoax.
- Of course. Yes.

261
00:11:01,286 --> 00:11:03,704
I mean, steel would not melt
at that temperature.

262
00:11:03,705 --> 00:11:06,623
I mean, take fire to steel
and see if it melts. It won’t.

263
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:07,875
- You try it.
- No, you know what?

264
00:11:07,876 --> 00:11:10,577
A missile sent by your own government
is probably what it was.

265
00:11:10,578 --> 00:11:12,462
- I read online there wasn't even a plane.
- Really?

266
00:11:12,463 --> 00:11:14,339
I’m starting to think
there wasn't even towers, dude.

267
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,300
- I'd never been to them.
- Has anybody seen the towers?

268
00:11:16,301 --> 00:11:18,844
- With your own eyes, not a picture.
- Exactly. Not a picture.

269
00:11:18,845 --> 00:11:21,096
Only seen pictures
the government has shown me.

270
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:23,098
They're changing the weather now,
do you know about this?

271
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:25,184
- They control the weather.
- Yeah. With frogs. I saw that.

272
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:26,894
- They control the weather.
- Yeah, with frogs.

273
00:11:26,895 --> 00:11:29,271
- Yeah, they shoot the frogs up there.
- They shoot frogs up there?

274
00:11:29,272 --> 00:11:32,774
- They're throwing tornadoes at Florida.
- Yeah. It creates a super storm.

275
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:35,778
- Crop control.
- The oranges. There's too many oranges.

276
00:11:37,864 --> 00:11:40,040
I know it sounds crazy,
but I think at one point,

277
00:11:40,041 --> 00:11:42,117
these people were trying
to start a boy band.

278
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:44,578
All right. Remember to combine
all three words here.

279
00:11:44,579 --> 00:11:46,079
<i>Darnell Lewis
and Jordan Cox,</i>

280
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,123
<i>please report to the principal’s office.</i>

281
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:49,541
I thought it was kinda odd

282
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:51,919
when Ava had one of the volunteers
making announcements.

283
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:55,339
<i>- Now, really think about--
- No. What? Actually, wait.</i>

284
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:56,506
<i>Yeah, sorry. Go to the bathroom.</i>

285
00:11:56,507 --> 00:11:58,325
<i>No, no. Don’t tell them
to go to the bathroom.</i>

286
00:11:58,326 --> 00:11:59,676
<i>Dennis, the acoustics are better.</i>

287
00:11:59,677 --> 00:12:01,511
<i>What? Have them come
to the music room.</i>

288
00:12:01,512 --> 00:12:03,180
<i>Yeah. Okay, fine.
Darnell and Jordan,</i>

289
00:12:03,181 --> 00:12:05,390
<i>please go to the music room
or whatever. Thank you.</i>

290
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:06,808
<i>Did you have that pushed
the whole time?</i>

291
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:08,685
<i>- The what? No, which... What?
- Keep doing your work.</i>

292
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:09,770
I'll be right back.

293
00:12:09,771 --> 00:12:12,814
So I had to go down there
and check it out for myself.

294
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:18,237
<i>♪ I’ll make love to you
Like you want me to ♪</i>

295
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:24,326
<i>♪ And I’ll hold you tight
Baby, all through the night ♪</i>

296
00:12:24,327 --> 00:12:27,204
- Ooh. This is what we want.
- Yeah, yeah.

297
00:12:27,205 --> 00:12:29,248
- This is it. This is good.
- A little pitchy at times.

298
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:30,332
- Very good singer.
- Very nice.

299
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:32,751
- He's a little pitchy, but it's fine.
- Yeah? But...

300
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:36,088
My main concern is
he's coming off like kind of a nerd.

301
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:37,673
You know we've already got our nerd.

302
00:12:37,674 --> 00:12:39,083
- We need a bad boy.
- We do.

303
00:12:39,384 --> 00:12:41,843
Hey, Steven, would you say
you’re a bad boy?

304
00:12:41,844 --> 00:12:43,136
I don’t know.

305
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:44,554
- You don't know?
- You don't know, huh?

306
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:46,640
I feel like a bad boy would know
if he was bad, right?

307
00:12:46,641 --> 00:12:47,925
- Yeah, he might.
- I think so.

308
00:12:47,926 --> 00:12:49,893
Damn it. I told Mac
to get the detention list.

309
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:51,395
Yeah, 'cause that's how
we're gonna find--

310
00:12:51,396 --> 00:12:55,065
Hey. Hey. How we doing?
All right. What's going on in here?

311
00:12:55,066 --> 00:12:58,110
Uh, we're just having auditions.
Well, Ava said it was okay.

312
00:12:58,111 --> 00:12:59,903
Ava said we could use the room.

313
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:02,030
- And we got her...
- Real quick, just wanna walk this back.

314
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:04,992
Um, Ava said that it was okay for you
to pull kids out of class

315
00:13:04,993 --> 00:13:06,243
- so they could sing for you?
- Yeah.

316
00:13:06,244 --> 00:13:08,120
Yeah. Otherwise
how we're gonna know who's the...

317
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:10,706
It was kinda like a class.
In a way, it's a music class.

318
00:13:10,707 --> 00:13:13,250
Basically like, we're just
kind of, like, shopping for kids here,

319
00:13:13,251 --> 00:13:14,918
and we got a pretty good collection.

320
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:17,170
You know, we got a nerd
and we got the boy next door.

321
00:13:17,171 --> 00:13:19,298
We got the ugly one
that people feel sorry for, but we...

322
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:21,925
He's so ugly too. But he is uglier than...

323
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:23,010
Maybe too ugly.

324
00:13:23,011 --> 00:13:24,761
- Yeah, maybe too ugly.
- Now we found our bad boy.

325
00:13:24,762 --> 00:13:27,723
You see, the bad boy
is the most important one.

326
00:13:27,724 --> 00:13:32,228
Because the bad boy
makes the sexual component less weird.

327
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:42,738
- Yeah. I wouldn't have said that, but...
- That's not why. That's not really the--

328
00:13:42,739 --> 00:13:45,866
This was some crazy shit.
I didn't wanna deal with it,
so I took it to Ava.

329
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:49,370
Ava.

330
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:51,872
- What?
- The others were right.

331
00:13:51,873 --> 00:13:53,665
These volunteers have got to go.

332
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:55,917
No. You were right.
They’re amazing, and they're staying.

333
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:58,837
Shit. I might frame 'em for another crime
just to get their hours up.

334
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:00,089
What? What? No.

335
00:14:00,765 --> 00:14:02,592
Did I ask you to stop steaming?

336
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:11,825
Okay. She was right.

337
00:14:11,826 --> 00:14:14,853
Between fighting teachers,
pissing in lockers and the boy band thing,

338
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:18,316
I should have booted their ass.
Because that white woman was going in.

339
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:22,069
What do you mean
you didn’t get the fight on camera?

340
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:23,528
What is wrong with you?

341
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:27,115
I let that bitch kick my ass
so that I could look like a victim.

342
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:29,117
You think I couldn't kick her...

343
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:31,620
She's tiny. I could destroy her.

344
00:14:31,621 --> 00:14:33,914
I'd rip her hair out.

345
00:14:33,915 --> 00:14:36,374
I'd rip this whole school bald
if I wanted to,

346
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:39,795
oh, but that would like some kind
of hate crime in the liberal media.

347
00:14:39,796 --> 00:14:42,756
Wouldn't they just love that.
No. I'm not doing it.

348
00:14:42,757 --> 00:14:46,134
What's wrong with you?
You call yourself a camera crew?

349
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:48,596
Oh, my God. Get your head out of your ass.

350
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:50,597
Nah, I’ve seen some shit.

351
00:14:50,598 --> 00:14:53,175
But crazy white people hit different.

352
00:14:53,176 --> 00:14:54,352
"Let me kick her ass?"

353
00:14:55,144 --> 00:15:00,566
No. I am not a violent person,
but if I wanna kick someone’s ass, I will.

354
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:03,194
"Let me kick her ass." She said that?

355
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:06,404
No. No. And you know what? I’m not mad.

356
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:09,867
I’m not,
because I am totally over that woman,

357
00:15:10,368 --> 00:15:13,704
um, because I’m a happy person. So...

358
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:21,003
I'm so sorry. I saw a mosquito.

359
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,257
Yes. So at one point,

360
00:15:25,258 --> 00:15:28,426
I was misled into believing
they were shooting an educational video

361
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:30,846
in the vein of Billy Joel’s
"We Didn’t Start The Fire."

362
00:15:30,847 --> 00:15:32,757
I don’t know
how the fuck they got on this.

363
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:34,392
Bye. See youse.

364
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:40,438
Knock, knock, knock. I've got a piping hot
caramel macchiato for a Melissa.

365
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:41,523
That's me.

366
00:15:41,524 --> 00:15:43,650
- Oh, there you are.
- Thank you, Dennis.

367
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:45,393
It's my pleasure.
Absolutely. Hey, Go birds.

368
00:15:45,394 --> 00:15:46,753
- Go birds.
- Hey, listen.

369
00:15:46,754 --> 00:15:48,446
Um, might I trouble you with a query?

370
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:52,945
On the subject of Billy Joel
with the scale being, one:
"I can’t stand his music"

371
00:15:52,945 --> 00:15:56,913
 to ten:
"I think he’s the single greatest musician
in the history of sound,"

372
00:15:56,914 --> 00:15:58,165
where do you place the man?

373
00:15:58,166 --> 00:16:01,460
Negative five.
But you know who is a massive fan?

374
00:16:02,036 --> 00:16:04,337
A hundred fifty. A million ten. Infinity.

375
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:06,173
Amazing. Okay, great. Yeah.

376
00:16:06,174 --> 00:16:10,887
So we are actually looking to recruit
teachers to help us with a little song.

377
00:16:13,014 --> 00:16:14,806
By that point, I should have known better

378
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:17,518
but, um, I'm a sucker
for anything Billy Joel related, so...

379
00:16:18,352 --> 00:16:19,644
- Yeah.
- This is really exciting, guys.

380
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:21,813
Okay. So here's what we're gonna do.

381
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:23,273
You, our modern educators,

382
00:16:23,274 --> 00:16:27,402
are going to sing the updated lyrics
to Billy Joel's classic song,

383
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:30,864
and we will be reenacting
the iconic historical moments

384
00:16:30,865 --> 00:16:32,324
on video at a later date.

385
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:34,284
Oh, my God.
Can we be part of that as well? 'Cause--

386
00:16:34,285 --> 00:16:35,994
I feel like it wouldn't be right
if you weren't.

387
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:37,996
- That's great. Let's get them involved.
- Yeah.

388
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:38,955
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Okay.

389
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:40,582
Matter of fact,
I'm gonna film the rehearsal.

390
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:41,959
Yeah, just shoot it. Shoot everything.

391
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:45,045
Okay, I'm gonna stumble through one.
Don't worry if you get it wrong.

392
00:16:45,046 --> 00:16:47,465
- Okay. Yeah.
- Let's just try it for time. Okay? Um...

393
00:16:48,382 --> 00:16:49,966
Okay. And...

408
00:17:26,796 --> 00:17:28,422
Actually, they did start a fire.

409
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:31,258
You see this? Look, it’s not even wilting.

410
00:17:31,259 --> 00:17:32,634
Mac, that’s indestructible.

411
00:17:32,635 --> 00:17:35,170
You’re telling me that an entire building
is gonna melt to the ground

412
00:17:35,171 --> 00:17:36,805
but we can’t even melt the bench?

413
00:17:36,806 --> 00:17:38,139
- I don't think so. Oh.
- Oh!

414
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:40,517
Oh, shit. It’s going up the wall.

415
00:17:40,518 --> 00:17:42,519
But eventually,
the whole song thing fell apart

416
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:45,272
when they discovered something
that they did not like.

417
00:17:45,273 --> 00:17:49,192
- Wow. Wow, guys. This was amazing.
- Yes.

418
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:51,611
- Love it. You guys.
- Charlie.

419
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:54,406
Look, guys. I'm so excited
and I really can't wait

420
00:17:54,407 --> 00:17:57,200
to be a part of the reenactment.
I just want to throw that out there again,

421
00:17:57,201 --> 00:18:00,495
but I'm just curious, like,
as to why you guys are doing it?

422
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:01,788
I just was wondering.

423
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:03,456
- Fair. Fair.
- Yeah. That's a good question. Like...

424
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:06,042
So we realized that the kids
don't know anything about 9/11 really.

425
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:09,337
It's like a joke or a meme to them.
And, like, "Never forget," you know?

426
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:11,673
We said, "Never forget,"
and they seemed to have forgotten.

427
00:18:11,674 --> 00:18:14,050
I love this. I mean, I love this.

428
00:18:14,051 --> 00:18:16,303
Human beings
have been educating one another

429
00:18:16,304 --> 00:18:18,972
through the method of song for generations

430
00:18:18,973 --> 00:18:21,808
that predate
even the most ancient of societies.

431
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:22,892
- Absolutely.
- Yeah.

432
00:18:22,893 --> 00:18:25,253
This particular song was instrumental,

433
00:18:25,254 --> 00:18:27,230
- I would say, in our education...
- It was big for us.

434
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:29,524
...and we just felt like it was due
for an update. Right.

435
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:30,684
- It's due for an update.
- Yes.

436
00:18:30,685 --> 00:18:33,320
And I love that you guys did it almost
better than Fall Out Boy, you know?

437
00:18:33,321 --> 00:18:34,988
- With the lyric change and everything.
- Yeah.

438
00:18:34,989 --> 00:18:36,407
Well then, no this is Billy Joel's song.

439
00:18:37,325 --> 00:18:41,161
No, no. The band Fall Out Boy, they
already did an update...

440
00:18:41,162 --> 00:18:42,370
- Yeah.
- ...like, of this song.

441
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:44,289
Changed all the lyrics and...

442
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:45,373
Who's Fall Out Boy?

443
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:48,293
It's an emo band that did
a really good update. It was really good.

444
00:18:48,294 --> 00:18:49,670
- Okay.
- Yeah.

445
00:18:50,838 --> 00:18:52,423
- I thought that's why you--
- Yeah.

446
00:18:52,923 --> 00:18:54,341
Will you excuse us for a moment?

447
00:18:54,342 --> 00:18:56,927
We're gonna need a...
- We're just gonna need a minute.
- Okay.

448
00:18:57,428 --> 00:18:59,304
Is it to go listen to their version?

449
00:18:59,305 --> 00:19:01,474
- To...
- No.
- No.
- Oh, okay.

450
00:19:02,525 --> 00:19:05,060
Apparently, this Fall Out Boy thing
was a big deal to them.

451
00:19:05,061 --> 00:19:06,144
Son of a bitch!

452
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:08,396
Every goddamn time
we try a single thing

453
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:10,148
this goddamn Fall Out Boy!

454
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:12,567
- Goddamn pricks!
- Always a step ahead of us! Fuckers!

455
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:14,277
I mean, the Ed Hardy jeans.

456
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:15,362
- The spiked hair.
- Yeah!

457
00:19:15,363 --> 00:19:16,980
Plus the eyeliner! That was my look.

458
00:19:16,981 --> 00:19:18,615
- He stole it from me.
- It was your look, Mac!

459
00:19:18,616 --> 00:19:19,699
That has been your look!

460
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:22,453
- Goddamn Fall Out Boy.
- This goddamn Fall Out Boy.

461
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,205
I've got nothing for this.

462
00:19:24,955 --> 00:19:27,374
In all my years
of teaching primary school,

463
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:32,295
I have never seen a student of mine
tantrum that long.

464
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:37,592
And these were full-grown adults
with fully-developed frontal lobes.

465
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:40,470
I thought they were done.
But then, I found this video online.

466
00:19:40,471 --> 00:19:43,099
It was titled
"Fall Out Boy can’t stop us."

475
00:20:04,328 --> 00:20:05,870
I gotta hand it to these jabronis.

476
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:07,664
'Cause I didn’t really like the original,

477
00:20:07,665 --> 00:20:12,127
'cause I felt like Billy Joel didn’t even
try to match the lyrics to the video,

478
00:20:12,128 --> 00:20:16,381
but these guys, they milked the school
for every minute of content they could.

479
00:20:16,382 --> 00:20:18,925
It reminded me of that verse on DMX’s
"What You Want."

480
00:20:18,926 --> 00:20:21,637
"There was Brenda,
LaTisha, Linda, Felicia."

481
00:20:22,138 --> 00:20:23,805
I wasn’t mad at it. It was a bop.

482
00:20:23,806 --> 00:20:26,726
Look, at the end of the day,
did I like those people?

483
00:20:27,727 --> 00:20:28,727
No. I did not.

484
00:20:28,728 --> 00:20:33,815
But I will admit that what they did
before they left was pretty nice.

485
00:20:33,816 --> 00:20:38,319
Thank you all so much for coming here.
Please enjoy a round of drinks on us.

486
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,573
- Johnnie Walker Blue.
- No spirits.

487
00:20:41,198 --> 00:20:42,657
Chardonnay, please.

488
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:45,076
Gosh, we don't have a bottle
already open.

489
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:46,619
- Yeah.
- Okay. Heineken.

490
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:48,246
- Well, no imports though.
- Yeah.

491
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:49,707
Jesus Christ.

492
00:20:50,341 --> 00:20:51,825
How about an iced tea?

493
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:55,378
- Iced tea. Uh, I think we have ice.
- Mm-mmm.

494
00:20:55,379 --> 00:20:56,713
Nope. You don’t have ice.

495
00:20:56,714 --> 00:20:58,423
- I already checked. And...
- Yeah, no.

496
00:20:58,424 --> 00:20:59,716
We're off water altogether.

497
00:20:59,717 --> 00:21:02,594
- Sorry.
- We're not doing water anymore in the bar.
It's a whole thing.

498
00:21:02,595 --> 00:21:04,971
I am so sorry, but why are we here?

499
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:06,514
- Like, what is this?
- Oh, right.

500
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:09,851
Yes, no. Fair. Um, yeah. Well, listen,
we just wanted to let you know

501
00:21:09,852 --> 00:21:12,938
that our experience with you
really touched us.

502
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:16,941
You know,
you blindsided us with your heart

503
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:18,526
and your care for those children.

504
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:20,904
And while Frank is sorry
that he couldn't be here today,

505
00:21:20,905 --> 00:21:25,283
he did spring for this gift
for your teacher's lounge.

506
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:26,367
Mac.

507
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:28,829
A new espresso machine.

508
00:21:30,414 --> 00:21:32,833
Nice, right?
We don't even have one of these.

509
00:21:33,793 --> 00:21:35,668
May you be as happy
as you are caffeinated.

510
00:21:37,922 --> 00:21:39,923
Maybe they're kinda sweet.
That was kinda sweet.

511
00:21:41,258 --> 00:21:43,469
It wasn’t that sweet. Come with me.

512
00:21:46,472 --> 00:21:49,266
I think they lured us down to their bar
so the old one could do this.

513
00:21:54,897 --> 00:21:57,399
He must’ve ripped out
about a hundred feet of copper.

514
00:21:58,275 --> 00:22:01,903
But on the bright side, the state was
gonna make us move out some old pipes,

515
00:22:01,904 --> 00:22:04,632
so actually he saved us a few grand
in construction costs.

516
00:22:05,366 --> 00:22:08,244
I’m gonna lose my job if anyone sees this,
so burn those tapes.
