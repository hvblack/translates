1
00:00:01,691 --> 00:00:04,873
>>> EARLIER THIS WEEK, ATTORNEY
GENERAL PAM BONDI

2
00:00:04,873 --> 00:00:07,025
APPEARED BEFORE THE SENATE JUDICIARY
COMMITTEE.

3
00:00:07,025 --> 00:00:09,041
AFTER THE CONCLUSION OF HER TESTIMONY,

4
00:00:09,041 --> 00:00:12,821
THE SENATORS
DETERMINED THAT SHE HADN'T
ACTUALLY ANSWERED ANY OF THEIR
QUESTIONS.

5
00:00:12,821 --> 00:00:15,360
SO SHE WAS RECALLED FOR A
FOLLOW-UP SESSION.

6
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,890
WE NOW JOIN THE PROCEEDINGS.

7
00:00:20,286 --> 00:00:23,584
>> ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

8
00:00:23,584 --> 00:00:27,342
I CALL THIS SESSION OF THE
SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE TO
ORDER.

KLOBUCHAR, BLUMENTHAL,

10
00:00:32,184 --> 00:00:39,638
AND THE
AGGRESSIVELY FOLKSY SENATOR
KENNEDY OF LOUISIANA PRESIDING.

11
00:00:39,638 --> 00:00:42,959
>> THANK YOU, MOST KINDLY.
AS WE SAY DOWN AROUND THE BAYOU,

12
00:00:42,959 --> 00:00:46,160
THIS IS ATTORNEY GENERAL GOT
SOME EXPLAINING TO DO.

13
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:50,052
>> AND SHE WILL.
WELCOME BACK, MADAME ATTORNEY
GENERAL.

14
00:00:50,052 --> 00:00:52,783
>> WHAT'S UP, NERDS?

15
00:00:56,785 --> 00:00:59,098
FURIOUS TO BE HERE.

16
00:00:59,098 --> 00:01:03,650
>> DO YOU AFFIRM THE TESTIMONY
YOU'RE ABOUT TO GIVE BEFORE THIS
COMMITTEE

17
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:08,150
WILL BE THE TRUTH, THE
WHOLE TRUTH AND NOTHING BUT THE
TRUTH, SO HELP YOU GOD?

18
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:09,917
>> NO.

19
00:01:09,917 --> 00:01:13,191
>> THANK YOU.
WOULD YOU LIKE TO MAKE AN
OPENING STATEMENT?

20
00:01:13,191 --> 00:01:15,891
>> YES, I WOULD.
MY NAME IS PAM BONDI.

21
00:01:15,891 --> 00:01:20,446
I SPELL WITH IT AN I BECAUSE I
AIN'T GOING TO ANSWER ANY OF
YOUR QUESTIONS.

22
00:01:20,446 --> 00:01:25,325
MY TIME IS VALUABLE.
THE DOJ HAS MANY ON GOING
OPERATIONS

23
00:01:25,325 --> 00:01:28,381
AND WE'RE MOVING LIKE
KASH PATEL'S EYEBALLS

24
00:01:28,381 --> 00:01:31,625
VERY
QUICKLY IN MULTIPLE DIRECTIONS
AT ONCE.

25
00:01:31,625 --> 00:01:35,892
>> VERY GOOD, MA'AM.
THE CHAIR RECOGNIZES SENATOR
BLUMENTHAL.

26
00:01:35,892 --> 00:01:38,034
>> MADAME ATTORNEY GENERAL,

27
00:01:38,034 --> 00:01:40,650
DID PRESIDENT TRUMP DIRECT YOU

28
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:43,539
TO PROSECUTE HIS POLITICAL
OPPONENTS?

29
00:01:43,539 --> 00:01:45,839
>> BEFORE I DON'T ANSWER,

30
00:01:45,839 --> 00:01:48,272
I WOULD LIKE TO INSULT YOU
PERSONALLY.

31
00:01:48,272 --> 00:01:52,061
SENATOR BLUMENTHAL, LOOK AT THIS
HONKY.

32
00:01:52,061 --> 00:01:57,273
EVEN PEOPLE IN CONNECTICUT GO,
DAMN, THAT GUY IS WHITE AS HELL.

33
00:01:57,273 --> 00:01:59,906
>> OKAY.

34
00:01:59,906 --> 00:02:04,804
>> THAT IS JUST ONE OF THE MANY
ROAST-STYLE BURNS I HAVE HERE ON
THIS PAPER.

35
00:02:04,804 --> 00:02:06,681
DON'T MAKE ME USE THEM.

36
00:02:06,681 --> 00:02:08,279
>> I'LL ASK AGAIN.

37
00:02:08,279 --> 00:02:12,671
DID THE PRESIDENT DIRECT YOU TO
INDICTMENT JAMES COMEY?

38
00:02:12,671 --> 00:02:16,871
>> I'M NOT GOING TO DISCUSS MY
PRIVATE CONVERSATIONS WITH THE
PRESIDENT.

39
00:02:16,871 --> 00:02:19,422
I'M NOT TELLING YOU WHO SAID WHAT

40
00:02:19,422 --> 00:02:22,071
OR WHO FELL ASLEEP THE
MIDDLE OF A SENTENCE

41
00:02:22,071 --> 00:02:26,693
OR WHO KEPT
CALLING ME IVANKA WHILE PATTING
HIS LAP.

42
00:02:26,693 --> 00:02:29,957
>> THE CHAIR RECOGNIZES SENATOR
WHITEHOUSE.

43
00:02:29,957 --> 00:02:32,875
>> GOOD BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT I
WANT TO TALK ABOUT,

44
00:02:32,875 --> 00:02:36,023
JEFFREY
EPSTEIN.

45
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:42,814
REALLY THOUGHT MORE SENATORS WERE
GOING TO CLAP.

46
00:02:42,814 --> 00:02:46,591
ANY WAY, DID THE FBI FIND PHOTOS

47
00:02:46,591 --> 00:02:49,552
OF PRESIDENT TRUMP WITH
HALF-NAKED YOUNG WOMEN --

48
00:02:49,552 --> 00:02:52,418
>> SIR.
>> -- WHEN THEY RAIDED MR.
EPSTEIN'S PROPERTY?

49
00:02:52,418 --> 00:02:56,904
SIR, I'M NOT EVEN GOING
TO DIGNIFY THAT QUESTION WITH A
LIE.

50
00:02:56,904 --> 00:03:00,299
>> CHAIR RECOGNIZES SENATOR
KENNEDY.

51
00:03:00,299 --> 00:03:03,179
OKAY NOW.

52
00:03:03,179 --> 00:03:08,241
YOU SAID YOU GOT A LIST OF THIS
EPSTEIN FELLA'S PLAYBOY FRIENDS
ON YOUR DESK.

53
00:03:08,241 --> 00:03:13,864
I BELIEVE IT'S YOUR JOB TO TELL
US, WHO IS ON THAT LIST THERE ON
YOUR DESK?

54
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:18,746
>> I TRIED READING THE EPSTEIN
FILES BUT I GOT REALLY BORED.

55
00:03:18,746 --> 00:03:23,037
IT'S SO REPETITIVE, TRUMP THIS,
TRUMP THAT, YAWN.

56
00:03:23,037 --> 00:03:28,308
>> MOVING ON.
THE CHAIR RECOGNIZES RANKING
MEMBER DICK DURBIN.

57
00:03:28,308 --> 00:03:30,445
>> YEAH, I RECOGNIZE DICK
DURBIN.

58
00:03:30,445 --> 00:03:35,115
HIS NAME SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING
DIDDY GOT ARRESTED FOR.

59
00:03:35,115 --> 00:03:37,090
THAT'S FROM MY BURN BOOK.

60
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:42,260
WHILE WE'RE AT IT, AMY
KLOBUCHAR, YOUR ASS OUT HERE
SOUNDING LIKE A POKEMON.

61
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:46,182
I CHOOSE YOU, KLOBUCHAR.

62
00:03:46,784 --> 00:03:49,086
>> YOU GOT ME.

63
00:03:49,086 --> 00:03:51,815
>> I'M GOING TO ASK MY QUESTION
NOW.

64
00:03:51,815 --> 00:03:56,982
HOW CAN PRESIDENT JUSTIFY
DEPLOYING TROOPS AGAINST
AMERICAN CITIZENS?

65
00:03:57,134 --> 00:04:00,211
DID YOU SEE THAT, HE PUSHED ME?

66
00:04:00,211 --> 00:04:01,448
>> I DID NOT.

67
00:04:01,448 --> 00:04:05,398
>> HE JUST CALLED ME A BITCH.
>> NO, I DIDN'T.

68
00:04:05,398 --> 00:04:08,906
NOW WHY IS THE PRESIDENT SENDING
TROOPS TO MY HOME STATE?

69
00:04:08,906 --> 00:04:11,388
>> TO PROTECT YOUR PEOPLE.

70
00:04:11,388 --> 00:04:16,124
AND I WISHED YOU LOVED CHICAGO
AS MUCH AS YOU HATE PRESIDENT
TRUMP.

71
00:04:16,124 --> 00:04:18,650
>> HOW LONG YOU BEEN WORKING ON
THAT LINE?

72
00:04:18,650 --> 00:04:21,886
>> THREE FULL MONTHS.

73
00:04:21,886 --> 00:04:25,260
>> YOU SAY THE TROOPS ARE THERE
TO PROTECT I.C.E. FACILITIES,

74
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:27,601
BUT WHY IS I.C.E. THERE IN THE
FIRST PLACE.

75
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:32,111
>> I DON'T KNOW.
YOU HAVE TO ASK HOMELAND
SECURITY DIRECTOR KRISTI NOEM.

76
00:04:32,111 --> 00:04:35,062
>> WELL, SHE ISN'T HERE.

77
00:04:35,062 --> 00:04:38,442
>> WHAT IF SHE IS, THOUGH.

78
00:04:46,118 --> 00:04:48,458
>> HOLD MY GUN.

79
00:04:48,458 --> 00:04:50,997
THAT'S RIGHT.
IT'S ME, KRISTI NOEM.

80
00:04:50,997 --> 00:04:55,583
I SPELL MY NAME WITH AN I
BECAUSE THAT'S HOW I THOUGHT IT WAS SPELT

81
00:04:55,583 --> 00:04:58,963
AND I'M THE RAREST
TYPE OF PERSON IN WASHINGTON, D.C.,

82
00:04:58,963 --> 00:05:01,887
A BRUNETTE THAT DONALD
TRUMP LISTENS TO.

83
00:05:01,887 --> 00:05:07,070
I'M HERE TO TELL YOU THAT THIS
DEMOCRAT GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN
NEEDS TO END NOW.

84
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:11,756
>> WELL, THE DEMOCRATS ARE EVEN
MORE EAGER TO END THIS SHUTDOWN

85
00:05:11,756 --> 00:05:13,904
THAN OUR REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES.

86
00:05:13,904 --> 00:05:18,305
>> THAT MAKES ME LAUGH MORE THAN
THE END OF OLD YELLER.

87
00:05:22,887 --> 00:05:26,365
>> WHEN THE DOG GETS SHOT?

88
00:05:26,365 --> 00:05:31,538
>> DOGS DON'T JUST GET SHOT.
HEROES SHOOT THEM.

89
00:05:31,756 --> 00:05:36,003
SPEAKING OF HEROES, OUR
GOVERNMENT AGENTS ARE WORKING
WITHOUT PAY.

90
00:05:36,003 --> 00:05:40,481
LUCKILY MY BOYS AT I.C.E. DON'T
MIND.
THEY'RE IN IT FOR THE LOVE OF
GAME.

91
00:05:40,481 --> 00:05:43,783
HOW DID I FIND THEM?
BY RUNNING ADS LIKE THIS.

92
00:05:43,783 --> 00:05:46,645
DO YOU NEED A JOB NOW?
>> YEAH.

93
00:05:46,645 --> 00:05:48,912
>> ARE YOU A BIG, TOUGH GUY?
>> YEAH.

94
00:05:48,912 --> 00:05:51,948
>> TOUGH ENOUGH FOR THE ARMY OR
POLICE?
>> NO.

95
00:05:51,948 --> 00:05:56,338
>> DO YOU TAKE SUPPLEMENTS YOU
BOUGHT AT THE GAS STATION?
>> DAILY.

96
00:05:56,338 --> 00:06:00,699
>> DO YOU HAVE TO USE ZIP TIES
BECAUSE PEOPLE IN YOUR LIFE
DON'T TRUST YOU WITH KEYS?

97
00:06:00,699 --> 00:06:02,203
>> YOU KNOW IT.

98
00:06:02,203 --> 00:06:06,511
THEN BUCKLE UP, SLAP ON SOME
OAKLEYS, WIG BOY.
WELCOME TO I.C.E.

99
00:06:12,528 --> 00:06:16,098
>> DOES THAT ANSWER YOUR
QUESTION?

100
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,815
>> NO.
NOT EVEN A LITTLE BIT.

101
00:06:19,815 --> 00:06:22,162
>> THEN OUR WORK HERE IS DONE.

102
00:06:22,162 --> 00:06:28,525
>>> AND LIVE FROM NEW YORK, IT'S
SATURDAY NIGHT!

103
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:36,222
MUSICAL

104
00:08:36,222 --> 00:08:40,792
HOST

105
00:08:43,233 --> 00:08:48,148
LADIES

106
00:09:09,906 --> 00:09:12,826
THANK

107
00:09:12,826 --> 00:09:15,985
I AM SO EXCITED TO BE HERE
TONIGHT.

108
00:09:15,985 --> 00:09:19,528
SNL IS SUCH A SPECIAL PLACE TO
ME.

109
00:09:19,528 --> 00:09:24,127
I FOUND MY FIRST LOVE HERE,
BEING FAMOUS.

110
00:09:24,127 --> 00:09:29,560
AND YOU KNOW, I'M STILL ON SOME
OF THE AMAZING MEDICATIONS THAT THEY PUT ME ON,

111
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:31,978
SO I WILL BE
FOREVER GRATEFUL.

112
00:09:31,978 --> 00:09:37,742
FOR THOSE WONDERING, I'M NOT
HERE TO TALK ABOUT A BIG MOVIE
OR TV PROJECT.

113
00:09:37,742 --> 00:09:40,663
BUT NOW THAT I HAVE YOUR
ATTENTION,

114
00:09:40,663 --> 00:09:43,534
I AM LOOKING FOR AN ANGEL INVESTOR

115
00:09:43,534 --> 00:09:49,178
FOR MY VERY ELITE
BRAND OF LOW SUGAR, HIGH TEQUILA SODAS

116
00:09:49,178 --> 00:09:51,549
CALLED POEHLERS COALERS,

117
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:56,334
LIKE JUST LIKE ME, ARE BANNED IN
THE STATE OF CONNECTICUT.

118
00:09:56,334 --> 00:10:01,489
LIFE IS GREAT.
I HAVE MY NEW PODCAST "GOOD
HANG" ON SPOTIFY.

119
00:10:01,489 --> 00:10:03,676
>> THANK YOU.

120
00:10:03,676 --> 00:10:06,496
THAT'S RIGHT.
I AM A PODCASTER NOW.

121
00:10:06,496 --> 00:10:11,108
AND IF THAT'S NOT A RECESSION
INDICATOR, I DON'T KNOW WHAT IS.

122
00:10:11,108 --> 00:10:14,782
>> BUT TONIGHT IS ACTUALLY VERY
SPECIAL NIGHT FOR THE SHOW,

123
00:10:14,782 --> 00:10:18,663
NOT
JUST BECAUSE I'M HERE, BUT
BECAUSE 50 YEARS AGO

124
00:10:18,663 --> 00:10:22,326
TODAY, ON
OCTOBER 11th, 1975,

125
00:10:22,326 --> 00:10:26,440
THE VERY
FIRST EPISODE OF "SNL" AIRED.

126
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:35,664
AND THAT EPISODE WAS HOSTED BY
GEORGE CARLIN.

127
00:10:35,664 --> 00:10:40,216
AND JUST LIKE GEORGE CARLIN, I'M
EXTREMELY HIGH.

128
00:10:41,242 --> 00:10:44,991
BUT YOU KNOW THE WORLD LOOKED A
LOT DIFFERENT IN 1975,

129
00:10:44,991 --> 00:10:49,773
FOR ONE
THING, WOMEN COULDN'T HAVE
CREDIT CARDS YET.

130
00:10:49,773 --> 00:10:55,054
YEAH, BUT NOW I'M KIND OF LIKE
SOMEBODY TAKE MY CREDIT CARD
AWAY.

131
00:10:55,054 --> 00:10:57,346
AM I RIGHT?

132
00:10:57,346 --> 00:11:00,340
I MADE THEM PUT THAT IN.

133
00:11:00,890 --> 00:11:04,020
IT'S ALWAYS A DREAM COME TRUE TO
BE HERE.

134
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:07,054
I REMEMBER WATCHING THE SHOW IN
THE '70s,

135
00:11:07,054 --> 00:11:10,001
SITTING IN MY HOUSE IN
BURLINGTON, MASSACHUSETTS,

136
00:11:10,001 --> 00:11:12,882
THINKING -- I WANT TO BE AN
ACTRESS SOME DAY.

137
00:11:12,882 --> 00:11:15,924
AT LEAST UNTIL THEY INVENT AN
A.I. ACTRESS

138
00:11:15,924 --> 00:11:20,080
WHO'S FUNNIER AND
WILLING TO DO FULL FRONTAL.

139
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,605
BUT 50 YEARS, WOW.

140
00:11:22,605 --> 00:11:26,408
YOU KNOW WHAT'S NICE ABOUT
TURNING 50, YOU START TO NOT
CARE ABOUT WHAT PEOPLE THINK.

141
00:11:26,408 --> 00:11:28,828
AND THAT'S WHAT'S SO GREAT ABOUT
SNL.

142
00:11:28,828 --> 00:11:32,261
SHE'S OBVIOUSLY STOPPED CARING.

143
00:11:32,261 --> 00:11:36,442
BUT NO MATTER THE AGE, IT'S
NEVER TOO LATE TO MAKE NEW
FRIENDS.

144
00:11:36,442 --> 00:11:40,053
SAY HELLO TO THE NEWEST CAST
MEMBERS, EVERYBODY.

145
00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:47,397
>> HEY, AMY.

146
00:11:47,397 --> 00:11:48,965
WE'RE SO EXCITED YOU'RE --

147
00:11:48,965 --> 00:11:52,542
>> KEEP IT MOVING.
WE DON'T KNOW EACH OTHER YET.
KEEP IT MOVING.

148
00:11:53,709 --> 00:11:57,887
ANY WAY, BEFORE WE START THE
SHOW, I JUST WANTED TO SAY ONE
THING.

149
00:11:57,887 --> 00:12:00,918
I KNOW IT CAN FEEL LIKE TIMES
ARE VERY TOUGH RIGHT NOW.

150
00:12:00,918 --> 00:12:04,392
AND IN SOME WAYS, THEY HAVE
ALWAYS BEEN AND THEY ALWAYS WILL
BE.

151
00:12:04,392 --> 00:12:08,350
SO I'LL JUST SAY THIS, IF
THERE'S A PLACE THAT FEELS LIKE HOME

152
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:11,131
YOU CAN GO BACK TO AND
LAUGH WITH FRIENDS,

153
00:12:11,131 --> 00:12:13,966
CONSIDER
YOURSELF LUCKY, AND I DO.

154
00:12:13,966 --> 00:12:18,241
AND TO THAT LITTLE A.I. ROBOT
WATCHING TV RIGHT NOW,

155
00:12:18,241 --> 00:12:20,529
WHO WANTS
TO BE ON THIS STAGE SOME DAY,

156
00:12:20,529 --> 00:12:26,158
I
SAY TO YOU, BEEP BEEP BOOP BOOP,

157
00:12:26,158 --> 00:12:28,345
WHICH TRANSLATES TO --

158
00:12:28,345 --> 00:12:31,908
YOU'LL NEVER BE ABLE TO WRITE A JOKE,
YOU STUPID ROBOT.

159
00:12:31,908 --> 00:12:34,986
AND I AM WILLING TO DO FULL
FRONTAL,

160
00:12:34,986 --> 00:12:38,047
BUT NOBODY HAS ASKED
ME, OKAY!

161
00:12:39,409 --> 00:12:45,201
ROLE MODEL IS HERE.

162
00:12:45,905 --> 00:12:49,436
STICK AROUND.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

163
00:13:11,287 --> 00:13:14,017
>>> THIS IS IT.
MY CHILDHOOD HOME.

164
00:13:14,017 --> 00:13:17,639
>> I'M SO EXCITED TO MEET YOUR
FAMILY!
>> THEY'RE EXCITED TO MEET YOU,
TOO.

165
00:13:17,639 --> 00:13:23,252
BEFORE WE GO IN, I SHOULD SAY
THEY CAN SEEM A LITTLE COLD AT
FIRST.

166
00:13:23,252 --> 00:13:25,810
>> OH, BABE.
I'M SURE IT'S FINE.
I'M AMAZING WITH PARENTS.

167
00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:28,140
I'VE DONE THIS HUNDREDS OF
TIMES.

168
00:13:28,512 --> 00:13:31,226
>> AH, WAIT, HUNDREDS?

169
00:13:31,226 --> 00:13:35,263
MOM, DAD, GRANDMA, I'M HOME!

170
00:13:35,832 --> 00:13:38,334
HI.

171
00:13:38,334 --> 00:13:42,779
>> UM WELCOME HOME, I GUESS.

172
00:13:42,779 --> 00:13:45,645
>> SO, YEAH.

173
00:13:45,645 --> 00:13:48,948
AS I WAS SAYING.

174
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:52,981
# EVERYTHING YOU DO OR SAY REACT
IN IN A WAY,

175
00:13:52,981 --> 00:13:58,260
THE FAMILY CALLED
THE RUDEMANS #

176
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:03,529
>> ANY WAYS.

177
00:14:05,827 --> 00:14:09,021
>> UM, OKAY.
HEY, MR. RUDEMAN.
NICE TO MEET YOU.

178
00:14:09,021 --> 00:14:11,414
AMANDA TELLS ME YOU WORK AT
NASA.

179
00:14:11,414 --> 00:14:15,000
>> BY WORK AT NASA, YOU MEAN I'M
EMPLOYED

180
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:20,899
BY THE NATIONAL
AERONAUTICS AND SPACE
ADMINISTRATION, THAN YEAH.

181
00:14:20,976 --> 00:14:24,911

184
00:14:35,217 --> 00:14:39,187
>> US, TOO.

185
00:14:40,952 --> 00:14:44,083
>> SO, I THINK THEY LIKE YOU.

186
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:48,121
>> ARE YOU SERIOUS?
THEIR TONE IS SO OFFENDED.

187
00:14:48,121 --> 00:14:50,571
>> HEY, SIS.

188
00:14:50,571 --> 00:14:56,785
AND OH, COOL.
THERE'S A RANDOM GUY IN MY
HOUSE.

189
00:14:56,785 --> 00:14:58,583
NICE.

190
00:14:58,583 --> 00:15:01,298
CAN I GET YOU SOMETHING TO
DRINK?

191
00:15:01,298 --> 00:15:03,919
>> YOU KNOW, I'LL HAVE A BEER IF
YOU'RE HAVING ONE.

192
00:15:03,919 --> 00:15:07,846
>> WHOA!

193
00:15:07,846 --> 00:15:11,426
HE'S A REAL KEEPER, SIS.

194
00:15:11,426 --> 00:15:14,375
I MEAN, WHAT.

195
00:15:14,375 --> 00:15:18,316
>> I KNOW.
RIGHT?

196
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:21,906
>> I FEEL LIKE I'M BLOWING THIS
RIGHT NOW.

197
00:15:21,906 --> 00:15:24,862
>> OH, NO, THIS IS THE BEST IT'S
EVER GONE.

198
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:29,154
>> I'LL GET THE LAND LINE

199
00:15:29,154 --> 00:15:33,350
WE RANDOMLY STILL HAVE.

200
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:38,391
RUDEMAN RESIDENTS.

201
00:15:38,759 --> 00:15:41,078
YEAH.
I KNOW.

202
00:15:41,078 --> 00:15:43,229
I'M THE ONE WHO MADE THE

203
00:15:43,231 --> 00:15:45,537
APPOINTMENT FOR TOMORROW.

204
00:15:45,537 --> 00:15:50,334
LIKE, BUT THANKS FOR THE
REMINDER.

205
00:15:50,334 --> 00:15:53,774
LIKE, WHAT?

206
00:15:53,774 --> 00:15:55,751
>> WHAT IS GOING ON?

207
00:15:55,751 --> 00:15:59,922
WHY DO THEY ALL TALK LIKE
THEY'RE A CASHIER AT BUFFALO
EXCHANGE?

208
00:15:59,922 --> 00:16:02,858
>> IT'S JUST HOW THEY TALK.

209
00:16:02,858 --> 00:16:08,212
>> ANY WAYS, I GOT THE CHEESE
DIP, I GUESS.

210
00:16:08,212 --> 00:16:10,489
>> HEY, DO YOU WRANT SOME HELP
CARRYING THAT?

211
00:16:10,489 --> 00:16:14,207
>> I THINK I CAN HANDLE A LITTLE --

212
00:16:19,207 --> 00:16:21,520
I'M FINE.

213
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:26,936
BUT THANKS FOR THE HELP UP, I
GUESS.

214
00:16:26,936 --> 00:16:30,984
>> UM, SO YEAH.

215
00:16:30,984 --> 00:16:35,532
>> NICE CATCH, MAN.

216
00:16:35,532 --> 00:16:38,519
>> OKAY.
STOP CLAP.

217
00:16:38,519 --> 00:16:40,218
I CAN'T WIN WITH YOU GUYS.

218
00:16:40,218 --> 00:16:43,610
HOW WOULD YOU LIKE IT IF I
TALKED TO YOU THE WAY YOU'RE
TALKING TO ME.

219
00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:47,866
UM, RIGHT?
WOW.
LIKE I WAS SAYING.

220
00:16:47,866 --> 00:16:49,324
>> NO!

221
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:54,293
>> DON'T YOU EVER SPEAK TO MY
FAMILY THAT WAY!

222
00:16:54,293 --> 00:16:59,960
>> SO, THAT JUST HAPPENED.

223
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:03,609
# THE RUDEMANS #

224
00:17:09,984 --> 00:17:12,111
>>> OH, SLOW DOWN, CHAMP.

225
00:17:12,111 --> 00:17:14,497
LOOK, I'M NOT AS YOUNG AS I USED
TO BE.

226
00:17:14,497 --> 00:17:17,035
AND I KNEW I NEEDED TO CUT BACK
ON MY DRINKING.

227
00:17:17,035 --> 00:17:19,423
SO I SWITCHED TO NONALCOHOLIC
BEER.

228
00:17:19,423 --> 00:17:22,340
SAME GREAT TASTE AS REGULAR
BEER, NONE OF THE BOOZE.

229
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:25,071
WHICH MEANT I COULD FINALLY HAVE
A COLD ONE WITH THE FELLAS 

230
00:17:25,071 --> 00:17:27,551
WHILE
STILL DOING THE RIGHT THING FOR
ME AND MY FAMILY.

231
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:30,380
BUT THEN I REALIZED, I WASN'T
GETTING DRUNK.

232
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:32,484
WHICH IS KIND OF THE POINT, YOU
KNOW?

233
00:17:32,484 --> 00:17:36,389
WHICH IS WHY NOW I DRINK
NON-NONALCOHOLIC BEER.

234
00:17:36,389 --> 00:17:40,385
FIRST NON-NONALCOHOLIC BEVERAGE
THAT'S OVER 96% ALCOHOL.

235
00:17:40,385 --> 00:17:42,676
SAME GREAT TASTE AS NONALCOHOLIC BEER

236
00:17:42,676 --> 00:17:46,828
 BUT WITH MORE ALCOHOL THAN
ANY BEVERAGE CURRENTLY ON THE
MARKET.

237
00:17:47,694 --> 00:17:49,122
HOT DOG.

238
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:53,258
PLUS, I STILL GET ALL THE SOCIAL
BENEFITS OF DRINKING
NONALCOHOLIC BEER, TOO.

239
00:17:53,258 --> 00:17:55,097
>> LOOKING GOOD, MAN.
WHAT YOU DRINKING?

240
00:17:55,097 --> 00:17:56,482
>> IT'S CALLED A NON.

241
00:17:56,482 --> 00:17:58,616
>> DAMN, SMELL LIKE GASOLINE.

242
00:17:58,616 --> 00:18:00,316
>> THANK YOU.
GET OUT OF HERE.

243
00:18:00,316 --> 00:18:02,185
SEE THAT HYPHEN RIGHT THERE?

244
00:18:02,185 --> 00:18:05,024
IT'S WHAT YOUR LAWYERS CALL THE
SKELETON KEY.

245
00:18:05,024 --> 00:18:06,957
THAT'S WHAT MAKES ALL THIS
POSSIBLE.

246
00:18:06,957 --> 00:18:10,078
SEE, NOT TECHNICALLY A LIE, IT'S
CALLED A DOUBLE NEGATIVE

247
00:18:10,173 --> 00:18:11,890
 AND IT
TASTES INCREDIBLE.

248
00:18:11,997 --> 00:18:13,456
>> ERIC, YOU'RE SOBER.

249
00:18:13,456 --> 00:18:16,222
>> AND YOU GAINED A FEW.
LOOKS LIKE WE'RE TWO THINGS.

250
00:18:16,222 --> 00:18:18,149
AIM

251
00:18:18,355 --> 00:18:21,927
AND THE BEST PART, YOU CAN
FINALLY DRINK AND DRIVE.

252
00:18:21,927 --> 00:18:26,077
>> SIR, YOU BEEN DRINKING TODAY?
>> JUST MY NONS, OF COURSE.

253
00:18:26,077 --> 00:18:29,305
>> GREAT.
YOU WON'T MIND IF I GIVE YOU A
BREATHALYZER.

254
00:18:30,539 --> 00:18:33,291
BACK UP.
BACKUP.
OH GOD.

255
00:18:33,291 --> 00:18:34,958
>> NOW NON-NONALCOHOLIC BEER.

256
00:18:34,958 --> 00:18:37,649
DOUBLE THE NEGATIVE, DOUBLE THE
PARTY.

257
00:19:03,819 --> 00:19:06,128
>>> SHE'S BLUNT, SHE'S
CLAIRVOYANT 

258
00:19:06,128 --> 00:19:08,093
AND SHE'S GOT A HARD

PSYCHIC.

260
00:19:12,789 --> 00:19:15,421
HEY. WELCOME TO THE SHOW.

>> ANGELINA, WHAT'S YOUR
QUESTION.

270
00:19:41,521 --> 00:19:46,812

271
00:19:46,812 --> 00:19:49,008
AND I HAVEN'T SEEN
HIM SINCE.

272
00:19:49,008 --> 00:19:50,761

HE DROWNED.
HE DROWNED UNTIL HE DIED.

275
00:19:56,299 --> 00:19:59,159
AND NOW HE'S FISH FOOD.
DOES THAT MAKE SENSE TO YOU?

276
00:19:59,159 --> 00:20:02,265
>> NO, BUT THANK YOU.

MY GRANDPA.

284

>> HE'S DEAD.

285
00:20:10,114 --> 00:20:15,351

286
00:20:15,353 --> 00:20:16,352
IS HE HERE RIGHT NOW?

287
00:20:16,354 --> 00:20:18,387
DOES HE HAVE A MESSAGE FOR ME?

288
00:20:18,389 --> 00:20:20,790
>> YEAH, HE SAYS HI FROM HELL.

289
00:20:20,792 --> 00:20:22,258

01:02:56,345 --> 01:02:58,378
WE TOOK THAT AND WE MADE A FIRST

1483
01:02:58,380 --> 01:02:58,678
DRAFT.

1484
01:02:58,680 --> 01:03:00,180
>> WELL, WE WOULD LOVE TO HEAR

1485
01:03:00,182 --> 01:03:00,947
THAT FIRST DRAFT.

1486
01:03:00,949 --> 01:03:03,717
COULD YOU PLAY IT FOR US?

1487
01:03:03,719 --> 01:03:04,784
>> CERTAINLY.

1488
01:03:04,786 --> 01:03:07,053
# LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT A THING

1489
01:03:07,055 --> 01:03:08,121
CALLED SEVERANCE #

1490
01:03:08,123 --> 01:03:10,490
>> TAKE A BIG KNIFE AND CUT YOUR

1491
01:03:10,492 --> 01:03:12,325
BRAIN IN HALF #

1492
01:03:12,327 --> 01:03:13,960
# ONE HALF FOR WORK, ONE HALF

1493
01:03:13,962 --> 01:03:17,163
FOR SEX, TUNE IN, SIT DOWN, IT'S

1494
01:03:17,165 --> 01:03:18,899
SEVERANCE #

1495
01:03:19,501 --> 01:03:20,667
>> ANYONE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS?

1496
01:03:20,669 --> 01:03:21,201
>> YEAH.

1497
01:03:21,203 --> 01:03:23,336
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO PUT THIS

1498
01:03:23,338 --> 01:03:23,770
RESPECTFULLY.

1499
01:03:23,772 --> 01:03:25,238
SO, I GUESS I WON'T TRY.

1500
01:03:25,240 --> 01:03:28,708
WHY DID YOU MAKE THAT?

1501
01:03:28,710 --> 01:03:30,043
>> THESE DAYS EVERY OPENING SONG

1502
01:03:30,045 --> 01:03:32,479
IS A CREEPY, MOODY INSTRUMENTAL.

1503
01:03:32,481 --> 01:03:33,446
WHAT HAPPENED TO TELLING PEOPLE

1504
01:03:33,448 --> 01:03:35,148
THE PLOT OF THE SHOW?

1505
01:03:35,150 --> 01:03:36,783
>> WHAT IS THE SHOW?

1506
01:03:36,785 --> 01:03:38,518
WHERE IS THE SHOW?

1507
01:03:38,520 --> 01:03:40,453
SHE WAS WORKING AT A BRIDAL SHOP

1508
01:03:40,455 --> 01:03:42,455
IN FLUSHING QUEENS.

1509
01:03:42,457 --> 01:03:43,023
AND BOOM.

1510
01:03:43,025 --> 01:03:46,526
I'M TRANSPORTED TO THE NANNY.

1511
01:03:46,528 --> 01:03:49,763
>> BUT THAT'S NOT THE PLOT OF

1512
01:03:49,765 --> 01:03:50,130
SEVERANCE.

1513
01:03:50,132 --> 01:03:51,398
THEY DON'T TAKE A BIG KNIFE AND

1514
01:03:51,400 --> 01:03:52,265
CHOP YOUR BRAIN IN HALF.

1515
01:03:52,267 --> 01:03:53,900
>> ALSO YOU SAID ONE HALF FOR

1516
01:03:53,902 --> 01:03:54,200
WORK.

1517
01:03:54,202 --> 01:03:55,335
ONE HALF FOR SEX.

1518
01:03:55,337 --> 01:03:58,138
THAT'S NOT WHAT SEVERANCE IS.

1519
01:03:58,140 --> 01:04:00,373
>> PERMISSION TO USE CORPORAL

1520
01:04:00,375 --> 01:04:02,208
PUNISHMENT ON HER?

1521
01:04:02,210 --> 01:04:03,410
>> UNFORTUNATELY NO.

1522
01:04:03,412 --> 01:04:05,078
YOU GUYS ALSO DID THE OPENING

1523
01:04:05,080 --> 01:04:06,846
FOR "THE PITT."

1524
01:04:06,848 --> 01:04:07,614
TRULY HAUNTING.

1525
01:04:07,616 --> 01:04:09,616
I WOULD LOVE TO HEAR ABOUT THAT

1526
01:04:09,618 --> 01:04:09,983
PROCESS.

1527
01:04:09,985 --> 01:04:12,552
>> WELL, IT WAS PRETTY STRAIGHT

1528
01:04:12,554 --> 01:04:12,886
FORWARD.

1529
01:04:12,888 --> 01:04:13,653
THE PRODUCERS DESCRIBED A SHOW

1530
01:04:13,655 --> 01:04:15,221
ABOUT THE TRAUMA FACED BY E.R.

1531
01:04:15,223 --> 01:04:15,889
WORKERS IN PITTSBURGH.

1532
01:04:15,891 --> 01:04:20,560
>> SO WE USED THAT AND CAME ONE

1533
01:04:20,562 --> 01:04:20,860
THIS.

1534
01:04:20,862 --> 01:04:22,896
# PITTSBURGH IS THE PLACE TO

01:04:25,367 --> 01:04:25,732
SEE #

1538
01:04:25,734 --> 01:04:30,904
# A BRIDGE, A BRIDGE, A BRIDGE A

1539
01:04:30,906 --> 01:04:31,471
BRIDGE #

1540
01:04:31,473 --> 01:04:34,541
# WELL TO "THE PITT" #

1541
01:04:34,543 --> 01:04:36,509
>>> ANYONE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ON

1542
01:04:36,511 --> 01:04:36,810
THAT?

1543
01:04:36,812 --> 01:04:39,846
>> DOES "THE PITT" EVEN HAVE AN

1544
01:04:39,848 --> 01:04:40,347
OPENING THEME.

1545
01:04:40,349 --> 01:04:43,450
>> UH, AFTER THEY HEARD WHAT WE

1546
01:04:43,452 --> 01:04:43,917
DID, NO?

1547
01:04:43,919 --> 01:04:46,753
>> WHY DO THESE ALL SOUND LIKE

1548
01:04:46,755 --> 01:04:48,588
THE FRESH PRINCE OF BELL AIR?

1549
01:04:48,590 --> 01:04:50,890
>> OH, TEACH, PLEASE LET ME PUT

1550
01:04:50,892 --> 01:04:52,192
BELT TO ASS.

1551

>> I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE SAYING

1552
01:04:54,229 --> 01:04:54,561
STUFF.

1553
01:04:54,563 --> 01:04:56,563
>> WE ACTUALLY DID MAKE THE

1554
01:04:56,565 --> 01:04:57,263
FRESH PRINCE SONG.

1555
01:04:57,265 --> 01:04:58,598
AND HERE IS WHAT THE FIRST DRAFT

1556
01:04:58,600 --> 01:05:03,136
OF THAT SOUNDED LIKE.

1557
01:05:03,472 --> 01:05:03,937
>> WAIT.

1558
01:05:03,939 --> 01:05:04,637
HOLD ON.

1559
01:05:04,639 --> 01:05:08,375
SO THAT ONE STARTED AS A SERIOUS

1560
01:05:08,377 --> 01:05:08,808
INSTRUMENTAL?

1561
01:05:08,810 --> 01:05:10,243
>> I HAVE TO SAY, YOUR GUY'S

1562
01:05:10,245 --> 01:05:11,945
BEST WORK WAS THE OPENING THEME

1563
01:05:11,947 --> 01:05:14,414
FOR "THE GILDED AGE" A SHOW

1564

ABOUT NEW YORK IN THE 1880s.

1565
01:05:15,884 --> 01:05:20,086
LET'S HEAR A LITTLE BIT OF THAT.

1566
01:05:20,455 --> 01:05:22,856
>> YEAH THAT GAVE US A LITTLE

1567
01:05:22,858 --> 01:05:23,523
BIT OF TROUBLE.

1568
01:05:23,525 --> 01:05:26,326
SO WE BROUGHT IN OUR MENTOR.

GILDED AGE ISN'T THE YEAR 2153.
