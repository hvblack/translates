APPEARED BEFORE THE SENATE JUDICIARY
COMMITTEE.

3
00:00:07,025 --> 00:00:09,041
AFTER THE CONCLUSION OF HER TESTIMONY,

4
00:00:09,041 --> 00:00:12,821
THE SENATORS
DETERMINED THAT SHE HADN'T
ACTUALLY ANSWERED ANY OF THEIR
QUESTIONS.

5
00:00:12,821 --> 00:00:15,360
SO SHE WAS RECALLED FOR A
FOLLOW-UP SESSION.

6
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,890
WE NOW JOIN THE PROCEEDINGS.

7
00:00:20,286 --> 00:00:23,584

AGGRESSIVELY FOLKSY SENATOR
KENNEDY OF LOUISIANA PRESIDING.

11
00:00:39,638 --> 00:00:42,959
>> THANK YOU, MOST KINDLY.
AS WE SAY DOWN AROUND THE BAYOU,

12
00:00:42,959 --> 00:00:46,160
THIS IS ATTORNEY GENERAL GOT
SOME EXPLAINING TO DO.

13
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:50,052
>> AND SHE WILL.
WELCOME BACK, MADAME ATTORNEY
GENERAL.

14
00:00:50,052 --> 00:00:52,783
>> WHAT'S UP, NERDS?

15
00:00:56,785 --> 00:00:59,098
FURIOUS TO BE HERE.

16
00:00:59,098 --> 00:01:03,650
>> DO YOU AFFIRM THE TESTIMONY
YOU'RE ABOUT TO GIVE BEFORE THIS
COMMITTEE

17
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:08,150

>> NO.

19
00:01:09,917 --> 00:01:13,191
>> THANK YOU.
WOULD YOU LIKE TO MAKE AN
OPENING STATEMENT?

20
00:01:13,191 --> 00:01:15,891
>> YES, I WOULD.
MY NAME IS PAM BONDI.

21
00:01:15,891 --> 00:01:20,446
I SPELL WITH IT AN I BECAUSE I
AIN'T GOING TO ANSWER ANY OF
YOUR QUESTIONS.

22
00:01:20,446 --> 00:01:25,325
MY TIME IS VALUABLE.
THE DOJ HAS MANY ON GOING
OPERATIONS

23
00:01:25,325 --> 00:01:28,381
AND WE'RE MOVING LIKE
KASH PATEL'S EYEBALLS

24
00:01:28,381 --> 00:01:31,625
VERY
QUICKLY IN MULTIPLE DIRECTIONS
AT ONCE.

>> VERY GOOD, MA'AM.
THE CHAIR RECOGNIZES SENATOR
BLUMENTHAL.

26
00:01:35,892 --> 00:01:38,034
>> MADAME ATTORNEY GENERAL,

27
00:01:38,034 --> 00:01:40,650
DID PRESIDENT TRUMP DIRECT YOU

28
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:43,539
TO PROSECUTE HIS POLITICAL
OPPONENTS?

29
00:01:43,539 --> 00:01:45,839
>> BEFORE I DON'T ANSWER,

30
00:01:45,839 --> 00:01:48,272
I WOULD LIKE TO INSULT YOU
PERSONALLY.

31
00:01:48,272 --> 00:01:52,061
SENATOR BLUMENTHAL, LOOK AT THIS
HONKY.

32
00:01:52,061 --> 00:01:57,273
EVEN PEOPLE IN CONNECTICUT GO,
DAMN, THAT GUY IS WHITE AS HELL.

33
00:01:57,273 --> 00:01:59,906
>> OKAY.

34
00:01:59,906 --> 00:02:04,804
>> THAT IS JUST ONE OF THE MANY
ROAST-STYLE BURNS I HAVE HERE ON
THIS PAPER.

35
00:02:04,804 --> 00:02:06,681
DON'T MAKE ME USE THEM.

36
00:02:06,681 --> 00:02:08,279
>> I'LL ASK AGAIN.

37
00:02:08,279 --> 00:02:12,671
DID THE PRESIDENT DIRECT YOU TO
INDICTMENT JAMES COMEY?

38
00:02:12,671 --> 00:02:16,871
>> I'M NOT GOING TO DISCUSS MY
PRIVATE CONVERSATIONS WITH THE
PRESIDENT.

39
00:02:16,871 --> 00:02:19,422
I'M NOT TELLING YOU WHO SAID WHAT

40
00:02:19,422 --> 00:02:22,071
OR WHO FELL ASLEEP THE
MIDDLE OF A SENTENCE

41
00:02:22,071 --> 00:02:26,693
OR WHO KEPT
CALLING ME IVANKA WHILE PATTING
HIS LAP.

42
00:02:26,693 --> 00:02:29,957
>> THE CHAIR RECOGNIZES SENATOR
WHITEHOUSE.

43
00:02:29,957 --> 00:02:32,875
>> GOOD BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT I
WANT TO TALK ABOUT,

44
00:02:32,875 --> 00:02:36,023
JEFFREY
EPSTEIN.

45
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:42,814
REALLY THOUGHT MORE SENATORS WERE
GOING TO CLAP.

46
00:02:42,814 --> 00:02:46,591
ANY WAY, DID THE FBI FIND PHOTOS

47
00:02:46,591 --> 00:02:49,552
OF PRESIDENT TRUMP WITH
HALF-NAKED YOUNG WOMEN --

48
00:02:49,552 --> 00:02:52,418
>> SIR.
>> -- WHEN THEY RAIDED MR.
EPSTEIN'S PROPERTY?

49
00:02:52,418 --> 00:02:56,904
SIR, I'M NOT EVEN GOING
TO DIGNIFY THAT QUESTION WITH A
LIE.

50
00:02:56,904 --> 00:03:00,299
>> CHAIR RECOGNIZES SENATOR
KENNEDY.

51
00:03:00,299 --> 00:03:03,179
OKAY NOW.

52
00:03:03,179 --> 00:03:08,241
YOU SAID YOU GOT A LIST OF THIS
EPSTEIN FELLA'S PLAYBOY FRIENDS
ON YOUR DESK.

53
00:03:08,241 --> 00:03:13,864
I BELIEVE IT'S YOUR JOB TO TELL
US, WHO IS ON THAT LIST THERE ON
YOUR DESK?

54
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:18,746
>> I TRIED READING THE EPSTEIN
FILES BUT I GOT REALLY BORED.

55
00:03:18,746 --> 00:03:23,037
IT'S SO REPETITIVE, TRUMP THIS,
TRUMP THAT, YAWN.

56
00:03:23,037 --> 00:03:28,308
>> MOVING ON.
THE CHAIR RECOGNIZES RANKING
MEMBER DICK DURBIN.

57
00:03:28,308 --> 00:03:30,445
>> YEAH, I RECOGNIZE DICK
DURBIN.

58
00:03:30,445 --> 00:03:35,115
HIS NAME SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING
DIDDY GOT ARRESTED FOR.

59
00:03:35,115 --> 00:03:37,090
THAT'S FROM MY BURN BOOK.

60
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:42,260
WHILE WE'RE AT IT, AMY
KLOBUCHAR, YOUR ASS OUT HERE
SOUNDING LIKE A POKEMON.

61
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:46,182
I CHOOSE YOU, KLOBUCHAR.

62
00:03:46,784 --> 00:03:49,086
>> YOU GOT ME.

63
00:03:49,086 --> 00:03:51,815
>> I'M GOING TO ASK MY QUESTION
NOW.

64
00:03:51,815 --> 00:03:56,982
HOW CAN PRESIDENT JUSTIFY
DEPLOYING TROOPS AGAINST
AMERICAN CITIZENS?

65
00:03:57,134 --> 00:04:00,211
DID YOU SEE THAT, HE PUSHED ME?

66
00:04:00,211 --> 00:04:01,448
>> I DID NOT.

67
00:04:01,448 --> 00:04:05,398
>> HE JUST CALLED ME A BITCH.
>> NO, I DIDN'T.

68
00:04:05,398 --> 00:04:08,906
NOW WHY IS THE PRESIDENT SENDING
TROOPS TO MY HOME STATE?

69
00:04:08,906 --> 00:04:11,388
>> TO PROTECT YOUR PEOPLE.

70
00:04:11,388 --> 00:04:16,124
AND I WISHED YOU LOVED CHICAGO
AS MUCH AS YOU HATE PRESIDENT
TRUMP.

71
00:04:16,124 --> 00:04:18,650
>> HOW LONG YOU BEEN WORKING ON
THAT LINE?

72
00:04:18,650 --> 00:04:21,886
>> THREE FULL MONTHS.

73
00:04:21,886 --> 00:04:25,260
>> YOU SAY THE TROOPS ARE THERE
TO PROTECT I.C.E. FACILITIES,

74
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:27,601
BUT WHY IS I.C.E. THERE IN THE
FIRST PLACE.

75
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:32,111
>> I DON'T KNOW.
YOU HAVE TO ASK HOMELAND
SECURITY DIRECTOR KRISTI NOEM.

76
00:04:32,111 --> 00:04:35,062
>> WELL, SHE ISN'T HERE.

77
00:04:35,062 --> 00:04:38,442
>> WHAT IF SHE IS, THOUGH.

78
00:04:46,118 --> 00:04:48,458
>> HOLD MY GUN.

79
00:04:48,458 --> 00:04:50,997
THAT'S RIGHT.
IT'S ME, KRISTI NOEM.

80
00:04:50,997 --> 00:04:55,583
I SPELL MY NAME WITH AN I
BECAUSE THAT'S HOW I THOUGHT IT WAS SPELT 

81
00:04:55,583 --> 00:04:58,963
AND I'M THE RAREST
TYPE OF PERSON IN WASHINGTON, D.C., 

82
00:04:58,963 --> 00:05:01,887
A BRUNETTE THAT DONALD
TRUMP LISTENS TO.

83
00:05:01,887 --> 00:05:07,070
I'M HERE TO TELL YOU THAT THIS
DEMOCRAT GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN
NEEDS TO END NOW.

84
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:11,756
>> WELL, THE DEMOCRATS ARE EVEN
MORE EAGER TO END THIS SHUTDOWN

85
00:05:11,756 --> 00:05:13,904
THAN OUR REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES.

86
00:05:13,904 --> 00:05:18,305
>> THAT MAKES ME LAUGH MORE THAN
THE END OF OLD YELLER.

87
00:05:22,887 --> 00:05:26,365
>> WHEN THE DOG GETS SHOT?

88
00:05:26,365 --> 00:05:31,538
>> DOGS DON'T JUST GET SHOT.
HEROES SHOOT THEM.

89
00:05:31,756 --> 00:05:36,003
SPEAKING OF HEROES, OUR
GOVERNMENT AGENTS ARE WORKING
WITHOUT PAY.

90
00:05:36,003 --> 00:05:40,481
LUCKILY MY BOYS AT I.C.E. DON'T
MIND.
THEY'RE IN IT FOR THE LOVE OF
GAME.

91
00:05:40,481 --> 00:05:41,611
HOW DID I FIND THEM?

92
00:05:41,613 --> 00:05:42,646
BY RUNNING ADS LIKE THIS.

93
00:05:42,648 --> 00:05:46,817
DO YOU NEED A JOB NOW?

94
00:05:46,819 --> 00:05:47,351
>> YEAH.

95
00:05:47,353 --> 00:05:48,018
>> ARE YOU A BIG, TOUGH GUY?

96
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:48,385
>> YEAH.

97
00:05:48,387 --> 00:05:49,119
>> TOUGH ENOUGH FOR THE ARMY OR

98
00:05:49,121 --> 00:05:49,953
POLICE?

99
00:05:49,955 --> 00:05:52,055
>> NO.

100
00:05:52,057 --> 00:05:52,789
>> DO YOU TAKE SUPPLEMENTS YOU

101
00:05:52,791 --> 00:05:55,158
BOUGHT AT THE GAS STATION?

102
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,226
>> DAILY.

103
00:05:56,228 --> 00:05:59,763
>> DO YOU HAVE TO USE ZIP TIES

104
00:05:59,765 --> 00:06:01,331
BECAUSE PEOPLE IN YOUR LIFE

105
00:06:01,333 --> 00:06:02,199
DON'T TRUST YOU WITH KEYS?

106
00:06:02,201 --> 00:06:04,201
>> YOU KNOW IT.

107
00:06:04,203 --> 00:06:09,573
THEN BUCKLE UP, SLAP ON SOME

108
00:06:09,575 --> 00:06:10,474
OAKLEYS, WIG BOY.

109
00:06:10,476 --> 00:06:12,676
WELCOME TO I.C.E.

110
00:06:14,313 --> 00:06:17,714
>> DOES THAT ANSWER YOUR

111
00:06:17,716 --> 00:06:18,382
QUESTION?

112
00:06:18,384 --> 00:06:18,949
>> NO.

113
00:06:18,951 --> 00:06:19,983
NOT EVEN A LITTLE BIT.

114
00:06:19,985 --> 00:06:23,720
>> THEN OUR WORK HERE IS DONE.

115
00:06:23,722 --> 00:06:30,660
>>> AND LIVE FROM NEW YORK, IT'S

116

SNL IS SUCH A SPECIAL PLACE TO

123
00:09:20,732 --> 00:09:20,997
ME.

124
00:09:20,999 --> 00:09:21,665
I FOUND MY FIRST LOVE HERE,

125
00:09:21,667 --> 00:09:24,067
BEING FAMOUS.

126
00:09:24,503 --> 00:09:26,136
AND YOU KNOW, I'M STILL ON SOME

127
00:09:26,138 --> 00:09:29,673
OF THE AMAZING MEDICATIONS THAT

128
00:09:29,675 --> 00:09:31,841
THEY PUT ME ON, SO I WILL BE

129
00:09:31,843 --> 00:09:32,809
FOREVER GRATEFUL.

130
00:09:32,811 --> 00:09:34,811
FOR THOSE WONDERING, I'M NOT

131
00:09:34,813 --> 00:09:37,814
HERE TO TALK ABOUT A BIG MOVIE

132
00:09:37,816 --> 00:09:38,982

JUST BECAUSE I'M HERE, BUT

151
00:10:19,958 --> 00:10:22,058
BECAUSE 50 YEARS AGO TODAY, ON

152

OCTOBER 11th, 1975, THE VERY

AND JUST LIKE GEORGE CARLIN, I'M

157
00:10:36,708 --> 00:10:40,844
EXTREMELY HIGH.

158
00:10:40,846 --> 00:10:43,513
BUT YOU KNOW THE WORLD LOOKED A

159
00:10:43,515 --> 00:10:46,116
LOT DIFFERENT IN 1975, FOR ONE

160
00:10:46,118 --> 00:10:47,150
THING, WOMEN COULDN'T HAVE

161
00:10:47,152 --> 00:10:50,787
CREDIT CARDS YET.

162
00:10:50,789 --> 00:10:53,390
YEAH, BUT NOW I'M KIND OF LIKE

163
00:10:53,392 --> 00:10:54,090
SOMEBODY TAKE MY CREDIT CARD

164
00:10:54,092 --> 00:10:56,960
AWAY.

165
00:10:56,962 --> 00:10:57,360
AM I RIGHT?

166
00:10:57,362 --> 00:11:01,131
I MADE THEM PUT THAT IN.

167
00:11:01,133 --> 00:11:02,699
IT'S ALWAYS A DREAM COME TRUE TO

168
00:11:02,701 --> 00:11:03,733
BE HERE.

169
00:11:03,735 --> 00:11:05,835
I REMEMBER WATCHING THE SHOW IN

170
00:11:05,837 --> 00:11:12,108
THE '70s, SITTING IN MY HOUSE IN

171
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:13,143
BURLINGTON, MASSACHUSETTS,

172
00:11:13,145 --> 00:11:13,810
THINKING -- I WANT TO BE AN

173
00:11:13,812 --> 00:11:14,711
ACTRESS SOME DAY.

174
00:11:14,713 --> 00:11:15,412
AT LEAST UNTIL THEY INVENT AN

175
00:11:15,414 --> 00:11:16,279
A.I. ACTRESS WHO'S FUNNIER AND

176
00:11:16,281 --> 00:11:17,313
WILLING TO DO FULL FRONTAL.

177
00:11:19,918 --> 00:11:21,451
BUT 50 YEARS, WOW.

178
00:11:21,453 --> 00:11:22,519
YOU KNOW WHAT'S NICE ABOUT

179
00:11:22,521 --> 00:11:24,054
TURNING 50, YOU START TO NOT

180
00:11:24,056 --> 00:11:27,991
CARE ABOUT WHAT PEOPLE THINK.

181
00:11:27,993 --> 00:11:29,659
AND THAT'S WHAT'S SO GREAT ABOUT

182
00:11:29,661 --> 00:11:30,160
SNL.

183
00:11:30,162 --> 00:11:33,797
SHE'S OBVIOUSLY STOPPED CARING.

184
00:11:33,799 --> 00:11:35,331
BUT NO MATTER THE AGE, IT'S

185
00:11:35,333 --> 00:11:37,000
NEVER TOO LATE TO MAKE NEW

186
00:11:37,002 --> 00:11:37,333
FRIENDS.

187
00:11:37,335 --> 00:11:40,403
SAY HELLO TO THE NEWEST CAST

188
00:11:40,405 --> 00:11:44,474
MEMBERS, EVERYBODY.

189
00:11:45,343 --> 00:11:48,511
>> HEY, AMY.

190
00:11:48,513 --> 00:11:49,946

191
00:11:49,948 --> 00:11:51,081
>> KEEP IT MOVING.

192
00:11:51,083 --> 00:11:52,449
WE DON'T KNOW EACH OTHER YET.

193
00:11:52,451 --> 00:11:53,583
KEEP IT MOVING.

194
00:11:55,954 --> 00:11:57,153
ANY WAY, BEFORE WE START THE

195
00:11:57,155 --> 00:11:58,488
SHOW, I JUST WANTED TO SAY ONE

196
00:11:58,490 --> 00:11:58,788
THING.

197
00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:00,256
I KNOW IT CAN FEEL LIKE TIMES

198
00:12:00,258 --> 00:12:02,158
ARE VERY TOUGH RIGHT NOW.

199
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:02,826
AND IN SOME WAYS, THEY HAVE

200
00:12:02,828 --> 00:12:03,560
ALWAYS BEEN AND THEY ALWAYS WILL

201
00:12:03,562 --> 00:12:06,963
BE.

202
00:12:06,965 --> 00:12:08,898
SO I'LL JUST SAY THIS, IF

203
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:10,066
THERE'S A PLACE THAT FEELS LIKE

204
00:12:10,068 --> 00:12:11,935
HOME YOU CAN GO BACK TO AND

205
00:12:11,937 --> 00:12:13,103
LAUGH WITH FRIENDS, CONSIDER

206
00:12:13,105 --> 00:12:15,672
YOURSELF LUCKY, AND I DO.

207
00:12:15,674 --> 00:12:18,708
AND TO THAT LITTLE A.I. ROBOT

208
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:22,345
WATCHING TV RIGHT NOW, WHO WANTS

209
00:12:22,347 --> 00:12:24,948

210
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:28,118
SAY TO YOU, BEEP BEEP BOOP BOOP,

211
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,753

213
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:33,723

328
00:17:14,589 --> 00:17:16,155
AND I KNEW I NEEDED TO CUT BACK

329
00:17:16,157 --> 00:17:17,023
ON MY DRINKING.

330
00:17:17,025 --> 00:17:19,559
SO I SWITCHED TO NONALCOHOLIC

331
00:17:19,561 --> 00:17:19,859
BEER.

332
00:17:19,861 --> 00:17:21,260
SAME GREAT TASTE AS REGULAR

333
00:17:21,262 --> 00:17:22,428
BEER, NONE OF THE BOOZE.

334
00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:23,663
WHICH MEANT I COULD FINALLY HAVE

335
00:17:23,665 --> 00:17:25,431
A COLD ONE WITH THE FELLAS WHILE

336
00:17:25,433 --> 00:17:26,532
STILL DOING THE RIGHT THING FOR

337
00:17:26,534 --> 00:17:27,533
ME AND MY FAMILY.

338
00:17:27,535 --> 00:17:30,203
BUT THEN I REALIZED, I WASN'T

339
00:17:30,205 --> 00:17:30,903
GETTING DRUNK.

340
00:17:30,905 --> 00:17:32,605
WHICH IS KIND OF THE POINT, YOU

341
00:17:32,607 --> 00:17:32,905
KNOW?

342
00:17:32,907 --> 00:17:36,375
WHICH IS WHY NOW I DRINK

343
00:17:36,377 --> 00:17:37,910
NON-NONALCOHOLIC BEER.

344
00:17:37,912 --> 00:17:39,779
FIRST NON-NONALCOHOLIC BEVERAGE

345
00:17:39,781 --> 00:17:41,581
THAT'S OVER 96% ALCOHOL.

346
00:17:41,583 --> 00:17:43,449
SAME GREAT TASTE AS NONALCOHOLIC

347
00:17:43,451 --> 00:17:45,251
BEER BUT WITH MORE ALCOHOL THAN

348
00:17:45,253 --> 00:17:47,653
ANY BEVERAGE CURRENTLY ON THE

349
00:17:47,655 --> 00:17:49,155
MARKET.

350
00:17:49,157 --> 00:17:49,422
OH.

351
00:17:49,424 --> 00:17:50,089
HOT DOG.

352
00:17:50,091 --> 00:17:51,858
PLUS, I STILL GET ALL THE SOCIAL

353
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:53,092
BENEFITS OF DRINKING

354
00:17:53,094 --> 00:17:53,760
NONALCOHOLIC BEER, TOO.

355
00:17:53,762 --> 00:17:55,027
>> LOOKING GOOD, MAN.

356
00:17:55,029 --> 00:17:57,163
WHAT YOU DRINKING?

357
00:17:57,165 --> 00:17:58,765
>> IT'S CALLED A NON.

358
00:17:58,767 --> 00:18:00,500
>> DAMN, SMELL LIKE GASOLINE.

359
00:18:00,502 --> 00:18:01,134
>> THANK YOU.

360
00:18:01,136 --> 00:18:02,335
GET OUT OF HERE.

361
00:18:02,337 --> 00:18:04,270
SEE THAT HYPHEN RIGHT THERE?

362
00:18:04,272 --> 00:18:05,805
IT'S WHAT YOUR LAWYERS CALL THE

363
00:18:05,807 --> 00:18:06,372
SKELETON KEY.

364
00:18:06,374 --> 00:18:07,740
THAT'S WHAT MAKES ALL THIS

365
00:18:07,742 --> 00:18:08,107
POSSIBLE.

366
00:18:08,109 --> 00:18:09,842
SEE, NOT TECHNICALLY A LIE, IT'S

367
00:18:09,844 --> 00:18:11,477
CALLED A DOUBLE NEGATIVE AND IT

368
00:18:11,479 --> 00:18:12,345
TASTES INCREDIBLE.

369
00:18:12,347 --> 00:18:13,579
>> ERIC, YOU'RE SOBER.

370
00:18:13,581 --> 00:18:15,014
>> AND YOU GAINED A FEW.

371
00:18:15,016 --> 00:18:19,719
LOOKS LIKE WE'RE TWO THINGS.

372
00:18:19,721 --> 00:18:22,121
AND THE BEST PART, YOU CAN

373
00:18:22,123 --> 00:18:23,623
FINALLY DRINK AND DRIVE.

374
00:18:23,625 --> 00:18:25,458
>> SIR, YOU BEEN DRINKING TODAY?

375
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:26,793
>> JUST MY NONS, OF COURSE.

376
00:18:26,795 --> 00:18:27,226
>> GREAT.

377
00:18:27,228 --> 00:18:30,763
YOU WON'T MIND IF I GIVE YOU A

378

HE DROWNED.

424
00:19:58,503 --> 00:20:00,236
HE DROWNED UNTIL HE DIED.

425
00:20:00,238 --> 00:20:03,105
AND NOW HE'S FISH FOOD.

426
00:20:03,107 --> 00:20:03,973

HE DROWNED BUT HE'S STILL ALIVE

456
00:20:34,806 --> 00:20:35,871
AND WHAT'S DEAD IS YOUR

457

MARRIAGE.

00:20:58,296 --> 00:21:00,129
THROUGH ME LIKE A BULLET TRAIN.

471
00:21:00,131 --> 00:21:01,764
>> MY FATHER RECENTLY PASSED

472
00:21:01,766 --> 00:21:02,064

THEME FOR "SEVERANCE," ONE OF

1624
01:02:35,057 --> 01:02:36,556
THE MOST ICONIC TITLE SONGS OF

1625
01:02:36,558 --> 01:02:37,457
THE DECADE.

01:02:54,710 --> 01:02:55,909
THE DARK TONE OF THE SHOW.

1633
01:02:55,911 --> 01:02:56,343

01:03:03,719 --> 01:03:04,784
>> CERTAINLY.

1640
01:03:04,786 --> 01:03:07,053
# LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT A THING

1641
01:03:07,055 --> 01:03:08,121
CALLED SEVERANCE #

1642
01:03:08,123 --> 01:03:10,490
>> TAKE A BIG KNIFE AND CUT YOUR

1643
01:03:10,492 --> 01:03:12,325
BRAIN IN HALF #

1644
01:03:12,327 --> 01:03:13,960
# ONE HALF FOR WORK, ONE HALF

1645
01:03:13,962 --> 01:03:17,163
FOR SEX, TUNE IN, SIT DOWN, IT'S

1646
01:03:17,165 --> 01:03:18,899
SEVERANCE #

I DON'T KNOW HOW TO PUT THIS

1650
01:03:23,338 --> 01:03:23,770
RESPECTFULLY.

1651
01:03:23,772 --> 01:03:25,238
SO, I GUESS I WON'T TRY.

1652
01:03:25,240 --> 01:03:28,708
WHY DID YOU MAKE THAT?

1653
01:03:28,710 --> 01:03:30,043
>> THESE DAYS EVERY OPENING SONG

1654
01:03:30,045 --> 01:03:32,479
IS A CREEPY, MOODY INSTRUMENTAL.

1655
01:03:32,481 --> 01:03:33,446
WHAT HAPPENED TO TELLING PEOPLE

1656
01:03:33,448 --> 01:03:35,148
THE PLOT OF THE SHOW?

1657
01:03:35,150 --> 01:03:36,783
>> WHAT IS THE SHOW?

1658
01:03:36,785 --> 01:03:38,518
WHERE IS THE SHOW?

1659
01:03:38,520 --> 01:03:40,453
SHE WAS WORKING AT A BRIDAL SHOP

1660
01:03:40,455 --> 01:03:42,455
IN FLUSHING QUEENS.

1661
01:03:42,457 --> 01:03:43,023
AND BOOM.

1662
01:03:43,025 --> 01:03:46,526
I'M TRANSPORTED TO THE NANNY.

1663
01:03:46,528 --> 01:03:49,763
>> BUT THAT'S NOT THE PLOT OF

1664
01:03:49,765 --> 01:03:50,130
SEVERANCE.

1665
01:03:50,132 --> 01:03:51,398
THEY DON'T TAKE A BIG KNIFE AND

1666
01:03:51,400 --> 01:03:52,265
CHOP YOUR BRAIN IN HALF.

1667
01:03:52,267 --> 01:03:53,900
>> ALSO YOU SAID ONE HALF FOR

1668
01:03:53,902 --> 01:03:54,200
WORK.

1669
01:03:54,202 --> 01:03:55,335
ONE HALF FOR SEX.

1670
01:03:55,337 --> 01:03:58,138
THAT'S NOT WHAT SEVERANCE IS.

1671
01:03:58,140 --> 01:04:00,373
>> PERMISSION TO USE CORPORAL

1672
01:04:00,375 --> 01:04:02,208
PUNISHMENT ON HER?

1673
01:04:02,210 --> 01:04:03,410
>> UNFORTUNATELY NO.

1674
01:04:03,412 --> 01:04:05,078
YOU GUYS ALSO DID THE OPENING

1699
01:04:43,919 --> 01:04:46,753
>> WHY DO THESE ALL SOUND LIKE

1700
01:04:46,755 --> 01:04:48,588
THE FRESH PRINCE OF BELL AIR?

1701
01:04:48,590 --> 01:04:50,890
>> OH, TEACH, PLEASE LET ME PUT

1702
01:04:50,892 --> 01:04:52,192
BELT TO ASS.

AND HERE IS WHAT THE FIRST DRAFT

1708
01:04:58,600 --> 01:05:03,136
OF THAT SOUNDED LIKE.

1709
01:05:03,472 --> 01:05:03,937

1710
01:05:03,939 --> 01:05:04,637
HOLD ON.

1711
01:05:04,639 --> 01:05:08,375
SO THAT ONE STARTED AS A SERIOUS

1712
01:05:08,377 --> 01:05:08,808
INSTRUMENTAL?

1713
01:05:08,810 --> 01:05:10,243

01:05:15,884 --> 01:05:20,086
LET'S HEAR A LITTLE BIT OF THAT.

1718

1719
01:05:22,858 --> 01:05:23,523
BIT OF TROUBLE.

1720

GILDED AGE ISN'T THE YEAR 2153.
