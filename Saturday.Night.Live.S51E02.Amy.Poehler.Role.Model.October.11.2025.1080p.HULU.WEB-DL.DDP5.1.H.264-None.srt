1
00:00:01,691 --> 00:00:04,873
>>> EARLIER THIS WEEK, ATTORNEY
GENERAL PAM BONDI

2
00:00:04,873 --> 00:00:07,025
APPEARED BEFORE THE SENATE JUDICIARY
COMMITTEE.

3
00:00:07,025 --> 00:00:09,041
AFTER THE CONCLUSION OF HER TESTIMONY,

4
00:00:09,041 --> 00:00:12,821
THE SENATORS
DETERMINED THAT SHE HADN'T
ACTUALLY ANSWERED ANY OF THEIR
QUESTIONS.

5
00:00:12,821 --> 00:00:15,360
SO SHE WAS RECALLED FOR A
FOLLOW-UP SESSION.

6
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,890
WE NOW JOIN THE PROCEEDINGS.

7
00:00:20,286 --> 00:00:23,584
>> ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

8
00:00:23,584 --> 00:00:27,342
I CALL THIS SESSION OF THE
SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE TO
ORDER.

KLOBUCHAR, BLUMENTHAL,

10
00:00:32,184 --> 00:00:39,638
AND THE
AGGRESSIVELY FOLKSY SENATOR
KENNEDY OF LOUISIANA PRESIDING.

11
00:00:39,638 --> 00:00:42,959
>> THANK YOU, MOST KINDLY.
AS WE SAY DOWN AROUND THE BAYOU,

12
00:00:42,959 --> 00:00:46,160
THIS IS ATTORNEY GENERAL GOT
SOME EXPLAINING TO DO.

13
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:50,052
>> AND SHE WILL.
WELCOME BACK, MADAME ATTORNEY
GENERAL.

14
00:00:50,052 --> 00:00:52,783
>> WHAT'S UP, NERDS?

15
00:00:56,785 --> 00:00:59,098
FURIOUS TO BE HERE.

16
00:00:59,098 --> 00:01:03,650
>> DO YOU AFFIRM THE TESTIMONY
YOU'RE ABOUT TO GIVE BEFORE THIS
COMMITTEE

17
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:08,150
WILL BE THE TRUTH, THE
WHOLE TRUTH AND NOTHING BUT THE
TRUTH, SO HELP YOU GOD?

18
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:09,917
>> NO.

19
00:01:09,917 --> 00:01:13,191
>> THANK YOU.
WOULD YOU LIKE TO MAKE AN
OPENING STATEMENT?

20
00:01:13,191 --> 00:01:15,891
>> YES, I WOULD.
MY NAME IS PAM BONDI.

21
00:01:15,891 --> 00:01:20,446
I SPELL WITH IT AN I BECAUSE I
AIN'T GOING TO ANSWER ANY OF
YOUR QUESTIONS.

22
00:01:20,446 --> 00:01:25,325
MY TIME IS VALUABLE.
THE DOJ HAS MANY ON GOING
OPERATIONS

23
00:01:25,325 --> 00:01:28,381
AND WE'RE MOVING LIKE
KASH PATEL'S EYEBALLS

24
00:01:28,381 --> 00:01:31,625
VERY
QUICKLY IN MULTIPLE DIRECTIONS
AT ONCE.

25
00:01:31,625 --> 00:01:35,892
>> VERY GOOD, MA'AM.
THE CHAIR RECOGNIZES SENATOR
BLUMENTHAL.

26
00:01:35,892 --> 00:01:38,034
>> MADAME ATTORNEY GENERAL,

27
00:01:38,034 --> 00:01:40,650
DID PRESIDENT TRUMP DIRECT YOU

28
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:43,539
TO PROSECUTE HIS POLITICAL
OPPONENTS?

29
00:01:43,539 --> 00:01:45,839
>> BEFORE I DON'T ANSWER,

30
00:01:45,839 --> 00:01:48,272
I WOULD LIKE TO INSULT YOU
PERSONALLY.

31
00:01:48,272 --> 00:01:52,061
SENATOR BLUMENTHAL, LOOK AT THIS
HONKY.

32
00:01:52,061 --> 00:01:57,273
EVEN PEOPLE IN CONNECTICUT GO,
DAMN, THAT GUY IS WHITE AS HELL.

33
00:01:57,273 --> 00:01:59,906
>> OKAY.

34
00:01:59,906 --> 00:02:04,804
>> THAT IS JUST ONE OF THE MANY
ROAST-STYLE BURNS I HAVE HERE ON
THIS PAPER.

35
00:02:04,804 --> 00:02:06,681
DON'T MAKE ME USE THEM.

36
00:02:06,681 --> 00:02:08,279
>> I'LL ASK AGAIN.

37
00:02:08,279 --> 00:02:12,671
DID THE PRESIDENT DIRECT YOU TO
INDICTMENT JAMES COMEY?

38
00:02:12,671 --> 00:02:16,871
>> I'M NOT GOING TO DISCUSS MY
PRIVATE CONVERSATIONS WITH THE
PRESIDENT.

39
00:02:16,871 --> 00:02:19,422
I'M NOT TELLING YOU WHO SAID WHAT

40
00:02:19,422 --> 00:02:22,071
OR WHO FELL ASLEEP THE
MIDDLE OF A SENTENCE

41
00:02:22,071 --> 00:02:26,693
OR WHO KEPT
CALLING ME IVANKA WHILE PATTING
HIS LAP.

42
00:02:26,693 --> 00:02:29,957
>> THE CHAIR RECOGNIZES SENATOR
WHITEHOUSE.

43
00:02:29,957 --> 00:02:32,875
>> GOOD BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT I
WANT TO TALK ABOUT,

44
00:02:32,875 --> 00:02:36,023
JEFFREY
EPSTEIN.

45
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:42,814
REALLY THOUGHT MORE SENATORS WERE
GOING TO CLAP.

46
00:02:42,814 --> 00:02:46,591
ANY WAY, DID THE FBI FIND PHOTOS

47
00:02:46,591 --> 00:02:49,552
OF PRESIDENT TRUMP WITH
HALF-NAKED YOUNG WOMEN --

48
00:02:49,552 --> 00:02:52,418
>> SIR.
>> -- WHEN THEY RAIDED MR.
EPSTEIN'S PROPERTY?

49
00:02:52,418 --> 00:02:56,904
SIR, I'M NOT EVEN GOING
TO DIGNIFY THAT QUESTION WITH A
LIE.

50
00:02:56,904 --> 00:03:00,299
>> CHAIR RECOGNIZES SENATOR
KENNEDY.

51
00:03:00,299 --> 00:03:03,179
OKAY NOW.

52
00:03:03,179 --> 00:03:08,241
YOU SAID YOU GOT A LIST OF THIS
EPSTEIN FELLA'S PLAYBOY FRIENDS
ON YOUR DESK.

53
00:03:08,241 --> 00:03:13,864
I BELIEVE IT'S YOUR JOB TO TELL
US, WHO IS ON THAT LIST THERE ON
YOUR DESK?

54
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:18,746
>> I TRIED READING THE EPSTEIN
FILES BUT I GOT REALLY BORED.

55
00:03:18,746 --> 00:03:23,037
IT'S SO REPETITIVE, TRUMP THIS,
TRUMP THAT, YAWN.

56
00:03:23,037 --> 00:03:28,308
>> MOVING ON.
THE CHAIR RECOGNIZES RANKING
MEMBER DICK DURBIN.

57
00:03:28,308 --> 00:03:30,445
>> YEAH, I RECOGNIZE DICK
DURBIN.

58
00:03:30,445 --> 00:03:35,115
HIS NAME SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING
DIDDY GOT ARRESTED FOR.

59
00:03:35,115 --> 00:03:37,090
THAT'S FROM MY BURN BOOK.

60
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:42,260
WHILE WE'RE AT IT, AMY
KLOBUCHAR, YOUR ASS OUT HERE
SOUNDING LIKE A POKEMON.

61
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:46,182
I CHOOSE YOU, KLOBUCHAR.

62
00:03:46,784 --> 00:03:49,086
>> YOU GOT ME.

63
00:03:49,086 --> 00:03:51,815
>> I'M GOING TO ASK MY QUESTION
NOW.

64
00:03:51,815 --> 00:03:56,982
HOW CAN PRESIDENT JUSTIFY
DEPLOYING TROOPS AGAINST
AMERICAN CITIZENS?

65
00:03:57,134 --> 00:04:00,211
DID YOU SEE THAT, HE PUSHED ME?

66
00:04:00,211 --> 00:04:01,448
>> I DID NOT.

67
00:04:01,448 --> 00:04:05,398
>> HE JUST CALLED ME A BITCH.
>> NO, I DIDN'T.

68
00:04:05,398 --> 00:04:08,906
NOW WHY IS THE PRESIDENT SENDING
TROOPS TO MY HOME STATE?

69
00:04:08,906 --> 00:04:11,388
>> TO PROTECT YOUR PEOPLE.

70
00:04:11,388 --> 00:04:16,124
AND I WISHED YOU LOVED CHICAGO
AS MUCH AS YOU HATE PRESIDENT
TRUMP.

71
00:04:16,124 --> 00:04:18,650
>> HOW LONG YOU BEEN WORKING ON
THAT LINE?

72
00:04:18,650 --> 00:04:21,886
>> THREE FULL MONTHS.

73
00:04:21,886 --> 00:04:25,260
>> YOU SAY THE TROOPS ARE THERE
TO PROTECT I.C.E. FACILITIES,

74
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:27,601
BUT WHY IS I.C.E. THERE IN THE
FIRST PLACE.

75
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:32,111
>> I DON'T KNOW.
YOU HAVE TO ASK HOMELAND
SECURITY DIRECTOR KRISTI NOEM.

76
00:04:32,111 --> 00:04:35,062
>> WELL, SHE ISN'T HERE.

77
00:04:35,062 --> 00:04:38,442
>> WHAT IF SHE IS, THOUGH.

78
00:04:46,118 --> 00:04:48,458
>> HOLD MY GUN.

79
00:04:48,458 --> 00:04:50,997
THAT'S RIGHT.
IT'S ME, KRISTI NOEM.

80
00:04:50,997 --> 00:04:55,583
I SPELL MY NAME WITH AN I
BECAUSE THAT'S HOW I THOUGHT IT WAS SPELT

81
00:04:55,583 --> 00:04:58,963
AND I'M THE RAREST
TYPE OF PERSON IN WASHINGTON, D.C.,

82
00:04:58,963 --> 00:05:01,887
A BRUNETTE THAT DONALD
TRUMP LISTENS TO.

83
00:05:01,887 --> 00:05:07,070
I'M HERE TO TELL YOU THAT THIS
DEMOCRAT GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN
NEEDS TO END NOW.

84
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:11,756
>> WELL, THE DEMOCRATS ARE EVEN
MORE EAGER TO END THIS SHUTDOWN

85
00:05:11,756 --> 00:05:13,904
THAN OUR REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES.

86
00:05:13,904 --> 00:05:18,305
>> THAT MAKES ME LAUGH MORE THAN
THE END OF OLD YELLER.

87
00:05:22,887 --> 00:05:26,365
>> WHEN THE DOG GETS SHOT?

88
00:05:26,365 --> 00:05:31,538
>> DOGS DON'T JUST GET SHOT.
HEROES SHOOT THEM.

89
00:05:31,756 --> 00:05:36,003
SPEAKING OF HEROES, OUR
GOVERNMENT AGENTS ARE WORKING
WITHOUT PAY.

90
00:05:36,003 --> 00:05:40,481
LUCKILY MY BOYS AT I.C.E. DON'T
MIND.
THEY'RE IN IT FOR THE LOVE OF
GAME.

91
00:05:40,481 --> 00:05:43,783
HOW DID I FIND THEM?
BY RUNNING ADS LIKE THIS.

92
00:05:43,783 --> 00:05:46,645
DO YOU NEED A JOB NOW?
>> YEAH.

93
00:05:46,645 --> 00:05:48,912
>> ARE YOU A BIG, TOUGH GUY?
>> YEAH.

94
00:05:48,912 --> 00:05:51,948
>> TOUGH ENOUGH FOR THE ARMY OR
POLICE?
>> NO.

95
00:05:51,948 --> 00:05:56,338
>> DO YOU TAKE SUPPLEMENTS YOU
BOUGHT AT THE GAS STATION?
>> DAILY.

96
00:05:56,338 --> 00:06:00,699
>> DO YOU HAVE TO USE ZIP TIES
BECAUSE PEOPLE IN YOUR LIFE
DON'T TRUST YOU WITH KEYS?

97
00:06:00,699 --> 00:06:02,203
>> YOU KNOW IT.

98
00:06:02,203 --> 00:06:06,511
THEN BUCKLE UP, SLAP ON SOME
OAKLEYS, WIG BOY.
WELCOME TO I.C.E.

99
00:06:12,528 --> 00:06:16,098
>> DOES THAT ANSWER YOUR
QUESTION?

100
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,815
>> NO.
NOT EVEN A LITTLE BIT.

101
00:06:19,815 --> 00:06:22,162
>> THEN OUR WORK HERE IS DONE.

102
00:06:22,162 --> 00:06:28,525
>>> AND LIVE FROM NEW YORK, IT'S
SATURDAY NIGHT!

103
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:36,222
MUSICAL

104
00:08:36,222 --> 00:08:40,792
HOST

105
00:08:43,233 --> 00:08:48,148
LADIES

106
00:09:09,906 --> 00:09:12,826
THANK

107
00:09:12,826 --> 00:09:15,985
I AM SO EXCITED TO BE HERE
TONIGHT.

108
00:09:15,985 --> 00:09:19,528
SNL IS SUCH A SPECIAL PLACE TO
ME.

109
00:09:19,528 --> 00:09:24,127
I FOUND MY FIRST LOVE HERE,
BEING FAMOUS.

110
00:09:24,127 --> 00:09:29,560
AND YOU KNOW, I'M STILL ON SOME
OF THE AMAZING MEDICATIONS THAT THEY PUT ME ON,

111
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:31,978
SO I WILL BE
FOREVER GRATEFUL.

112
00:09:31,978 --> 00:09:37,742
FOR THOSE WONDERING, I'M NOT
HERE TO TALK ABOUT A BIG MOVIE
OR TV PROJECT.

113
00:09:37,742 --> 00:09:40,663
BUT NOW THAT I HAVE YOUR
ATTENTION,

114
00:09:40,663 --> 00:09:43,534
I AM LOOKING FOR AN ANGEL INVESTOR

115
00:09:43,534 --> 00:09:49,178
FOR MY VERY ELITE
BRAND OF LOW SUGAR, HIGH TEQUILA SODAS

116
00:09:49,178 --> 00:09:51,549
CALLED POEHLERS COALERS,

117
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:56,334
LIKE JUST LIKE ME, ARE BANNED IN
THE STATE OF CONNECTICUT.

118
00:09:56,334 --> 00:10:01,489
LIFE IS GREAT.
I HAVE MY NEW PODCAST "GOOD
HANG" ON SPOTIFY.

119
00:10:01,489 --> 00:10:03,676
>> THANK YOU.

120
00:10:03,676 --> 00:10:06,496
THAT'S RIGHT.
I AM A PODCASTER NOW.

121
00:10:06,496 --> 00:10:11,108
AND IF THAT'S NOT A RECESSION
INDICATOR, I DON'T KNOW WHAT IS.

122
00:10:11,108 --> 00:10:14,782
>> BUT TONIGHT IS ACTUALLY VERY
SPECIAL NIGHT FOR THE SHOW,

123
00:10:14,782 --> 00:10:18,663
NOT
JUST BECAUSE I'M HERE, BUT
BECAUSE 50 YEARS AGO

124
00:10:18,663 --> 00:10:22,326
TODAY, ON
OCTOBER 11th, 1975,

125
00:10:22,326 --> 00:10:26,440
THE VERY
FIRST EPISODE OF "SNL" AIRED.

126
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:35,664
AND THAT EPISODE WAS HOSTED BY
GEORGE CARLIN.

127
00:10:35,664 --> 00:10:40,216
AND JUST LIKE GEORGE CARLIN, I'M
EXTREMELY HIGH.

128
00:10:41,242 --> 00:10:44,991
BUT YOU KNOW THE WORLD LOOKED A
LOT DIFFERENT IN 1975,

129
00:10:44,991 --> 00:10:49,773
FOR ONE
THING, WOMEN COULDN'T HAVE
CREDIT CARDS YET.

130
00:10:49,773 --> 00:10:55,054
YEAH, BUT NOW I'M KIND OF LIKE
SOMEBODY TAKE MY CREDIT CARD
AWAY.

131
00:10:55,054 --> 00:10:57,346
AM I RIGHT?

132
00:10:57,346 --> 00:11:00,340
I MADE THEM PUT THAT IN.

133
00:11:00,890 --> 00:11:04,020
IT'S ALWAYS A DREAM COME TRUE TO
BE HERE.

134
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:07,054
I REMEMBER WATCHING THE SHOW IN
THE '70s,

135
00:11:07,054 --> 00:11:10,001
SITTING IN MY HOUSE IN
BURLINGTON, MASSACHUSETTS,

136
00:11:10,001 --> 00:11:12,882
THINKING -- I WANT TO BE AN
ACTRESS SOME DAY.

137
00:11:12,882 --> 00:11:15,924
AT LEAST UNTIL THEY INVENT AN
A.I. ACTRESS

138
00:11:15,924 --> 00:11:20,080
WHO'S FUNNIER AND
WILLING TO DO FULL FRONTAL.

139
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,605
BUT 50 YEARS, WOW.

140
00:11:22,605 --> 00:11:26,408
YOU KNOW WHAT'S NICE ABOUT
TURNING 50, YOU START TO NOT
CARE ABOUT WHAT PEOPLE THINK.

141
00:11:26,408 --> 00:11:28,828
AND THAT'S WHAT'S SO GREAT ABOUT
SNL.

142
00:11:28,828 --> 00:11:32,261
SHE'S OBVIOUSLY STOPPED CARING.

143
00:11:32,261 --> 00:11:36,442
BUT NO MATTER THE AGE, IT'S
NEVER TOO LATE TO MAKE NEW
FRIENDS.

144
00:11:36,442 --> 00:11:40,053
SAY HELLO TO THE NEWEST CAST
MEMBERS, EVERYBODY.

145
00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:47,397
>> HEY, AMY.

146
00:11:47,397 --> 00:11:48,965
WE'RE SO EXCITED YOU'RE --

147
00:11:48,965 --> 00:11:52,542
>> KEEP IT MOVING.
WE DON'T KNOW EACH OTHER YET.
KEEP IT MOVING.

148
00:11:53,709 --> 00:11:57,887
ANY WAY, BEFORE WE START THE
SHOW, I JUST WANTED TO SAY ONE
THING.

149
00:11:57,887 --> 00:12:00,918
I KNOW IT CAN FEEL LIKE TIMES
ARE VERY TOUGH RIGHT NOW.

150
00:12:00,918 --> 00:12:04,392
AND IN SOME WAYS, THEY HAVE
ALWAYS BEEN AND THEY ALWAYS WILL
BE.

151
00:12:04,392 --> 00:12:08,350
SO I'LL JUST SAY THIS, IF
THERE'S A PLACE THAT FEELS LIKE HOME

152
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:11,131
YOU CAN GO BACK TO AND
LAUGH WITH FRIENDS,

153
00:12:11,131 --> 00:12:13,966
CONSIDER
YOURSELF LUCKY, AND I DO.

154
00:12:13,966 --> 00:12:18,241
AND TO THAT LITTLE A.I. ROBOT
WATCHING TV RIGHT NOW,

155
00:12:18,241 --> 00:12:20,529
WHO WANTS
TO BE ON THIS STAGE SOME DAY,

156
00:12:20,529 --> 00:12:26,158
I
SAY TO YOU, BEEP BEEP BOOP BOOP,

157
00:12:26,158 --> 00:12:28,345
WHICH TRANSLATES TO --

158
00:12:28,345 --> 00:12:31,908
YOU'LL NEVER BE ABLE TO WRITE A JOKE,
YOU STUPID ROBOT.

159
00:12:31,908 --> 00:12:34,986
AND I AM WILLING TO DO FULL
FRONTAL,

160
00:12:34,986 --> 00:12:38,047
BUT NOBODY HAS ASKED
ME, OKAY!

161
00:12:39,409 --> 00:12:45,201
ROLE MODEL IS HERE.

162
00:12:45,905 --> 00:12:49,436
STICK AROUND.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

163
00:13:11,287 --> 00:13:14,017
>>> THIS IS IT.
MY CHILDHOOD HOME.

164
00:13:14,017 --> 00:13:17,639
>> I'M SO EXCITED TO MEET YOUR
FAMILY!
>> THEY'RE EXCITED TO MEET YOU,
TOO.

165
00:13:17,639 --> 00:13:23,252
BEFORE WE GO IN, I SHOULD SAY
THEY CAN SEEM A LITTLE COLD AT
FIRST.

166
00:13:23,252 --> 00:13:25,810
>> OH, BABE.
I'M SURE IT'S FINE.
I'M AMAZING WITH PARENTS.

167
00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:28,140
I'VE DONE THIS HUNDREDS OF
TIMES.

168
00:13:28,512 --> 00:13:31,226
>> AH, WAIT, HUNDREDS?

169
00:13:31,226 --> 00:13:35,263
MOM, DAD, GRANDMA, I'M HOME!

170
00:13:35,832 --> 00:13:38,334
HI.

171
00:13:38,334 --> 00:13:42,779
>> UM WELCOME HOME, I GUESS.

172
00:13:42,779 --> 00:13:45,645
>> SO, YEAH.

173
00:13:45,645 --> 00:13:48,948
AS I WAS SAYING.

174
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:52,981
# EVERYTHING YOU DO OR SAY REACT
IN IN A WAY,

175
00:13:52,981 --> 00:13:58,260
THE FAMILY CALLED
THE RUDEMANS #

176
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:03,529
>> ANY WAYS.

177
00:14:05,827 --> 00:14:09,021
>> UM, OKAY.
HEY, MR. RUDEMAN.
NICE TO MEET YOU.

178
00:14:09,021 --> 00:14:11,414
AMANDA TELLS ME YOU WORK AT
NASA.

179
00:14:11,414 --> 00:14:15,000
>> BY WORK AT NASA, YOU MEAN I'M
EMPLOYED

180
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:20,899
BY THE NATIONAL
AERONAUTICS AND SPACE
ADMINISTRATION, THAN YEAH.

181
00:14:20,976 --> 00:14:24,911

183
00:14:29,683 --> 00:14:35,140
>> ANY WAY, I GUESS I'LL JUST GO

184
00:14:35,217 --> 00:14:39,187
>> US, TOO.

185
00:14:40,952 --> 00:14:44,083
>> SO, I THINK THEY LIKE YOU.

186
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:48,121
>> ARE YOU SERIOUS?
THEIR TONE IS SO OFFENDED.

187
00:14:48,121 --> 00:14:50,571
>> HEY, SIS.

188
00:14:50,571 --> 00:14:56,785
AND OH, COOL.
THERE'S A RANDOM GUY IN MY
HOUSE.

189
00:14:56,785 --> 00:14:58,583
NICE.

190
00:14:58,583 --> 00:15:01,298
CAN I GET YOU SOMETHING TO
DRINK?

191
00:15:01,298 --> 00:15:03,919
>> YOU KNOW, I'LL HAVE A BEER IF
YOU'RE HAVING ONE.

192
00:15:03,919 --> 00:15:07,846
>> WHOA!
AT 10:00 A.M.?

193
00:15:07,846 --> 00:15:11,426
HE'S A REAL KEEPER, SIS.

194
00:15:11,426 --> 00:15:14,375
I MEAN, WHAT.

195
00:15:14,375 --> 00:15:18,316
>> I KNOW.
RIGHT?

196
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:21,906
>> I FEEL LIKE I'M BLOWING THIS
RIGHT NOW.

197
00:15:21,906 --> 00:15:24,862
>> OH, NO, THIS IS THE BEST IT'S
EVER GONE.

198
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:29,154
>> I'LL GET THE LAND LINE

199
00:15:29,154 --> 00:15:33,350
WE RANDOMLY STILL HAVE.

200
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:38,391
RUDEMAN RESIDENTS.

201
00:15:38,759 --> 00:15:41,078
YEAH.
I KNOW.

202
00:15:41,078 --> 00:15:43,229
I'M THE ONE WHO MADE THE

203
00:15:43,231 --> 00:15:45,537
APPOINTMENT FOR TOMORROW.

204
00:15:45,537 --> 00:15:50,334
LIKE, BUT THANKS FOR THE
REMINDER.

205
00:15:50,334 --> 00:15:53,774
LIKE, WHAT?

206
00:15:53,774 --> 00:15:55,751
>> WHAT IS GOING ON?

207
00:15:55,751 --> 00:15:59,922
WHY DO THEY ALL TALK LIKE
THEY'RE A CASHIER AT BUFFALO
EXCHANGE?

208
00:15:59,922 --> 00:16:02,858
>> IT'S JUST HOW THEY TALK.

209
00:16:02,858 --> 00:16:08,212
>> ANY WAYS, I GOT THE CHEESE
DIP, I GUESS.

210
00:16:08,212 --> 00:16:10,489
>> HEY, DO YOU WRANT SOME HELP
CARRYING THAT?

211
00:16:10,489 --> 00:16:14,207
>> I THINK I CAN HANDLE A LITTLE --

212
00:16:19,207 --> 00:16:21,520
I'M FINE.

213
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:26,936
BUT THANKS FOR THE HELP UP, I
GUESS.

214
00:16:26,936 --> 00:16:30,984
>> UM, SO YEAH.
THAT JUST HAPPENED.

215
00:16:30,984 --> 00:16:35,532
>> NICE CATCH, MAN.

216
00:16:35,532 --> 00:16:38,519
>> OKAY.
STOP CLAP.

217
00:16:38,519 --> 00:16:40,218
I CAN'T WIN WITH YOU GUYS.

218
00:16:40,218 --> 00:16:43,610
HOW WOULD YOU LIKE IT IF I
TALKED TO YOU THE WAY YOU'RE
TALKING TO ME.

219
00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:47,866
UM, RIGHT?
WOW.
LIKE I WAS SAYING.

220
00:16:47,866 --> 00:16:49,324
>> NO!

221
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:54,293
>> DON'T YOU EVER SPEAK TO MY
FAMILY THAT WAY!

222
00:16:54,293 --> 00:16:59,960
>> SO, THAT JUST HAPPENED.

223
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:03,609
# THE RUDEMANS #

224
00:17:09,984 --> 00:17:12,111
>>> OH, SLOW DOWN, CHAMP.

225
00:17:12,111 --> 00:17:14,497
LOOK, I'M NOT AS YOUNG AS I USED
TO BE.

226
00:17:14,497 --> 00:17:17,035
AND I KNEW I NEEDED TO CUT BACK
ON MY DRINKING.

227
00:17:17,035 --> 00:17:19,423
SO I SWITCHED TO NONALCOHOLIC
BEER.

228
00:17:19,423 --> 00:17:22,340
SAME GREAT TASTE AS REGULAR
BEER, NONE OF THE BOOZE.

229
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:25,071
WHICH MEANT I COULD FINALLY HAVE
A COLD ONE WITH THE FELLAS

230
00:17:25,071 --> 00:17:27,551
WHILE
STILL DOING THE RIGHT THING FOR
ME AND MY FAMILY.

231
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:30,380
BUT THEN I REALIZED, I WASN'T
GETTING DRUNK.

232
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:32,484
WHICH IS KIND OF THE POINT, YOU
KNOW?

233
00:17:32,484 --> 00:17:36,389
WHICH IS WHY NOW I DRINK
NON-NONALCOHOLIC BEER.

234
00:17:36,389 --> 00:17:40,385
FIRST NON-NONALCOHOLIC BEVERAGE
THAT'S OVER 96% ALCOHOL.

235
00:17:40,385 --> 00:17:42,676
SAME GREAT TASTE AS NONALCOHOLIC BEER

236
00:17:42,676 --> 00:17:46,828
BUT WITH MORE ALCOHOL THAN
ANY BEVERAGE CURRENTLY ON THE
MARKET.

237
00:17:47,694 --> 00:17:49,122
HOT DOG.

238
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:53,258
PLUS, I STILL GET ALL THE SOCIAL
BENEFITS OF DRINKING
NONALCOHOLIC BEER, TOO.

239
00:17:53,258 --> 00:17:55,097
>> LOOKING GOOD, MAN.
WHAT YOU DRINKING?

240
00:17:55,097 --> 00:17:56,482
>> IT'S CALLED A NON.

241
00:17:56,482 --> 00:17:58,616
>> DAMN, SMELL LIKE GASOLINE.

242
00:17:58,616 --> 00:18:00,316
>> THANK YOU.
GET OUT OF HERE.

243
00:18:00,316 --> 00:18:02,185
SEE THAT HYPHEN RIGHT THERE?

244
00:18:02,185 --> 00:18:05,024
IT'S WHAT YOUR LAWYERS CALL THE
SKELETON KEY.

245
00:18:05,024 --> 00:18:06,957
THAT'S WHAT MAKES ALL THIS
POSSIBLE.

246
00:18:06,957 --> 00:18:10,078
SEE, NOT TECHNICALLY A LIE, IT'S
CALLED A DOUBLE NEGATIVE

247
00:18:10,173 --> 00:18:11,890
AND IT
TASTES INCREDIBLE.

248
00:18:11,997 --> 00:18:13,456
>> ERIC, YOU'RE SOBER.

249
00:18:13,456 --> 00:18:16,222
>> AND YOU GAINED A FEW.
LOOKS LIKE WE'RE TWO THINGS.

250
00:18:16,222 --> 00:18:18,149
AIM

251
00:18:18,355 --> 00:18:21,927
AND THE BEST PART, YOU CAN
FINALLY DRINK AND DRIVE.

252
00:18:21,927 --> 00:18:26,077
>> SIR, YOU BEEN DRINKING TODAY?
>> JUST MY NONS, OF COURSE.

253
00:18:26,077 --> 00:18:29,305
>> GREAT.
YOU WON'T MIND IF I GIVE YOU A
BREATHALYZER.

254
00:18:30,539 --> 00:18:33,291
BACK UP.
BACKUP.
OH GOD.

255
00:18:33,291 --> 00:18:34,958
>> NOW NON-NONALCOHOLIC BEER.

256
00:18:34,958 --> 00:18:37,649
DOUBLE THE NEGATIVE, DOUBLE THE
PARTY.

257
00:19:03,819 --> 00:19:06,128
>>> SHE'S BLUNT, SHE'S
CLAIRVOYANT

258
00:19:06,128 --> 00:19:08,093
AND SHE'S GOT A HARD
OUT AT 7.

259
00:19:08,093 --> 00:19:11,981
SHE IS MISS LYCUS, THE FAST
PSYCHIC.

260
00:19:12,789 --> 00:19:15,421
HEY. WELCOME TO THE SHOW.
MY NAME IS MISS LYCUS,

261
00:19:15,421 --> 00:19:18,308
I'M A

264
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:27,178
>> THANKS FOR BEING HERE.

265
00:19:27,178 --> 00:19:29,930
WE HAVE A BUNCH OF SAD,
DESPERATE PEOPLE IN THE AUDIENCE

266
00:19:29,930 --> 00:19:33,341
WHO WANT ANSWERS FROM BEYOND THE
SHADOWS.
I'M GOING TO GIVE THEM THOSE.

267
00:19:33,341 --> 00:19:35,419
YOU IN THE TABLE CLOTH.
GO.

268
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:39,759
>> HI, MY NAME IS ANGELINA.

269
00:19:39,759 --> 00:19:41,521
>> ANGELINA, WHAT'S YOUR
QUESTION.
GO.

270
00:19:41,521 --> 00:19:46,812
>> OKAY, SO 15 YEARS AGO MY DAD
LEFT OUR HOUSE TO BUY A PACK OF CIGARETTES

271
00:19:46,812 --> 00:19:49,008
AND I HAVEN'T SEEN
HIM SINCE.

272
00:19:49,008 --> 00:19:50,761
>> HE'S DEAD.

273
00:19:51,386 --> 00:19:53,743
>> WHAT?
>> HONEY, HE DIED.

274
00:19:53,743 --> 00:19:56,299
HE DROWNED.
HE DROWNED UNTIL HE DIED.

275
00:19:56,299 --> 00:19:59,159
AND NOW HE'S FISH FOOD.
DOES THAT MAKE SENSE TO YOU?

276
00:19:59,159 --> 00:20:02,265
>> NO, BUT THANK YOU.

277
00:20:03,215 --> 00:20:04,460
NEXT

278
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:06,252
>> WOW.
OKAY.

279
00:20:06,252 --> 00:20:08,238
>> OKAY.
SHUT UP.
NEXT.

280
00:20:08,238 --> 00:20:11,125
>> HI, SO I HAD A QUESTION ABOUT
MY GRANDPA.

281
00:20:11,125 --> 00:20:12,184
>> HE'S DEAD.

282
00:20:12,238 --> 00:20:15,301
>> OH, I KNOW.
IS HE HERE RIGHT NOW?

283
00:20:15,301 --> 00:20:16,437
DOES HE HAVE A MESSAGE FOR ME?

284
00:20:16,437 --> 00:20:19,367
>> YEAH, HE SAYS HI FROM HELL.
DOES THAT MAKE SENSE TO YOU?

285
00:20:19,367 --> 00:20:21,529
>> NO, BUT THANK YOU.

286
00:20:21,529 --> 00:20:23,726
>> NEXT.
GO, GO, GO.

287
00:20:24,727 --> 00:20:26,836
>> HI.
SO MY HUSBAND --

288
00:20:26,836 --> 00:20:28,893
>> HE'S DEAD.
HE DIED.
HE DROWNED.
NEXT.

289
00:20:28,893 --> 00:20:30,583
>> OH, NO, ACTUALLY HE'S RIGHT
HERE.

290
00:20:30,583 --> 00:20:33,502
>> HONEY, I KNOW.
I KNOW THAT.
HE DROWNED BUT HE'S STILL ALIVE

291
00:20:33,502 --> 00:20:35,285
AND WHAT'S DEAD IS YOUR
MARRIAGE.

292
00:20:35,285 --> 00:20:37,587
I HATE LOOKING AT YOU.
YOU LOOK LIKE SIBLINGS.

293
00:20:37,587 --> 00:20:40,818
HE'S CHEATING ON YOU WITH A
WOMAN AS TALL AS HE IS.
DOES THAT MAKE SENSE TO YOU?

294
00:20:40,818 --> 00:20:43,697
>> NOT AT ALL.
>> YES, IT DOES.

295
00:20:43,697 --> 00:20:46,720
>> BUT THANK YOU.

296
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:49,865
>> THANK YOU FOR WHAT.
WHY ARE YOU GOING SO FAST?

297
00:20:49,865 --> 00:20:54,308
>> BECAUSE I JUST TOOK A
COLONOSCOPY DRINK AND IT'S GOING

00:21:40,535 --> 00:21:42,875
SO, TIME FOR THE SPEED ROUND.

NOT EVERY BIRTH TAKES PLACE IN A
HOSPITAL.

405
00:26:23,587 --> 00:26:27,485

BREAK?

413

>> YES, I DID.
EXCUSE ME, ZACCHARYA.

421

I PUT TOGETHER SOME OF OUR
FORTUNE 200 GROWTH CHARTS,

422
00:27:16,918 --> 00:27:18,553
JUST

ABILITIES --

423
00:27:18,553 --> 00:27:20,756

00:27:27,852 --> 00:27:29,381
I THINK WE JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE

428
00:27:29,381 --> 00:27:33,397
OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE
CLIENT JUST GO BEYOND THE --

429
00:27:34,267 --> 00:27:36,459
ARE
YOU SAGING ME?

430
00:27:36,579 --> 00:27:38,396
>> SORRY.
JUST CLEANSING THE ENERGY.

431
00:27:38,396 --> 00:27:41,809
IT'S KIND OF A DOG WATER AURA
COMING FROM THIS DIRECTION HERE.

432
00:27:41,809 --> 00:27:44,083
>> HONEY, HONEY!
EXCUSE ME.

433
00:27:44,083 --> 00:27:46,532
I'M HERE, HONEY.
I CAME AS FAST AS I COULD.

447
00:28:27,612 --> 00:28:30,493
SHIMMY THAT LITTLE WORM OUT INTO
THE USA.

448
00:28:30,493 --> 00:28:33,026
>> THIS IS NOT HOW DOULAS TALK.

449
00:28:33,026 --> 00:28:36,400

DONE THIS BEFORE.

Sally, When the Wine Runs Out

462
00:29:58,702 --> 00:30:02,751
I MET SALLY AT A
LATE-NIGHT DIVE BAR

463
00:30:02,751 --> 00:30:06,529
SHE DON'T DANCE
BUT SHE DOWNS HER DRINKS #

464
00:30:06,529 --> 00:30:10,645
# HEARD THROUGH A FRIEND

# SHE WAS TELLING ME

466
00:30:14,279 --> 00:30:18,501
OH SHE WAS TELLING ME
WILD THINGS #

467
00:30:18,501 --> 00:30:22,625
# LIVES DOWN THE STREET

00:30:22,625 --> 00:30:26,352

# SHE GRABBED MY HAND

# WELL I OPEN UP WHILE SHE'S
FLIPPING THROUGH PAGES

481
00:31:18,814 --> 00:31:22,498
GETTING LONELY AS

>>> WELL, IT IS NICE TO START
UPDATE WITH SOME GOOD NEWS

517
00:34:15,495 --> 00:34:18,119
FOR
ONCE THERE IS PEACE THE MIDDLE
EAST.

518
00:34:18,119 --> 00:34:22,312
THE ONLY DOWNSIDE IS THERE'S WAR
IN CHICAGO.

519
00:34:22,312 --> 00:34:26,027
ONLY TRUMP COULD FREAKY FRIDAY
CHICAGO AND GAZA.

520
00:34:26,027 --> 00:34:29,870
AND I KNOW TRUMP IS UPSET THAT
HE DIDN'T WIN THE NOBEL PEACE PRIZE,

521
00:34:29,870 --> 00:34:33,660
BUT THE LAST GUY TO SEND
HEAVILY ARMED MEN INTO AN
AMERICAN CITY

522
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:36,341
WAS BANE FROM
BATMAN.

523
00:34:36,341 --> 00:34:39,298
BANE, WHO IS ALSO SNUBBED FOR
THE PEACE PRIZE.

524
00:34:39,298 --> 00:34:44,231
AND TRUMP DESERVES CREDIT, I
HAVE TO SAY, FOR BROKERING THIS
CEASEFIRE IN GAZA,

525
00:34:44,231 --> 00:34:45,867
BUT I'M
SLIGHTLY SKEPTICAL

526
00:34:45,867 --> 00:34:47,305
SINCE BIDEN

527
00:34:47,307 --> 00:34:50,712
ALSO NEGOTIATED A CEASEFIRE IN
GAZA NINE MONTHS AGO.

528
00:34:50,712 --> 00:34:52,546
REMEMBER THAT?
NO?

529
00:34:52,546 --> 00:34:54,855
WELL, NEITHER DOES BIDEN.

WAS AWARDED THIS WEEK

00:35:16,653 --> 00:35:18,165
SENSE

537
00:35:18,165 --> 00:35:22,704
CRAZY PEOPLE ONLY LISTEN TO
OTHER CRAZY PEOPLE.

538
00:35:22,704 --> 00:35:26,645
YOU SEE A GUY JACKING ON THE
SUBWAY YOU DON'T ASK HIM TO
STOP.

539
00:35:26,645 --> 00:35:31,207
YOU HAVE TO TAKE OFF YOUR PANTS
TOO, AND NOW WE CAN NEGOTIATE.

CIRCUMCISED ARE MORE LIKELY TO
BE AUTISTIC.

543
00:35:51,356 --> 00:35:54,057
WHICH ISN'T SURPRISING COMING
FROM A MAN

544
00:35:54,057 --> 00:35:57,394
WHO LOOKS LIKE HE'S
MADE OUT OF FORESKIN.

545
00:35:59,541 --> 00:36:01,472
>> NOT MINE.

546
00:36:02,311 --> 00:36:05,635
THE PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS
REPORTEDLY BECOME CONCERNED

547
00:36:05,635 --> 00:36:10,844
WITH
CONGRESSWOMAN MARJORIE TAYLOR
GREENE, CRITICIZING REPUBLICANS ON KEY ISSUES

WITH TRUMP ASKING,
WHAT'S GOING ON WITH MARJORIE?

549
00:36:13,470 --> 00:36:17,080
LITTLE ADVICE, BRO, LET HER GO.
YOU CAN'T CHANGE HER.

550
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:20,107
GOD KNOWS I'VE TRIED.

551
00:36:21,932 --> 00:36:27,102
>>> U.S. TREASURY IS PLANNING TO
RELEASE A SILVER DOLLAR WITH
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S FACE ON IT,

552
00:36:27,102 --> 00:36:32,069
AND THEN ON THE OTHER SIDE, HE
HAS HARRIET TUBMAN IN A HEAD
LOCK.

553
00:36:36,729 --> 00:36:40,669
>>> THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS
ALSO ROLLING OUT A VIDEO AT AIRPORTS

554
00:36:40,669 --> 00:36:44,152
IN WHICH KRISTI NOEM
WILL BLAME DEMOCRATS FOR FLIGHT DELAYS

555
00:36:44,152 --> 00:36:47,262

>> IT'S MEMORABLE.

558
00:36:55,946 --> 00:37:00,658
>>> PRESIDENT TRUMP ISSUED A
PROCLAMATION ENDING INDIGENOUS PEOPLE'S DAY

00:37:00,658 --> 00:37:04,420
AND CALLING
CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS THE
ORIGINAL AMERICAN HERO.

560
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:07,108
SO WHILE TRUMP IS ROUNDING UP PEOPLE WITH I.C.E.,

561
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,591
HE IS PRAISING COLUMBUS

A GUY WHO
LITERALLY BROUGHT BOAT LOADS OF
HISPANICS TO AMERICA.

569
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:41,363
I HAVE TO SAY, RHONDA, YOU HAVE
VERY PANICKED ENERGY ALREADY.

570
00:37:41,363 --> 00:37:43,984
>> OH, ME?
WHY WOULD I BE PANICKED?

571
00:37:43,984 --> 00:37:48,900
OH, I'M JUST THRILLED THAT OUR
CITY IS ABOUT TO BE TAKEN OVER

572
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:52,351
BY MY FAVORITE TYPE OF PERSON,

REAL NEW YORKER, CHE.

576
00:38:03,866 --> 00:38:06,684
HE'S FROM UGANDA.
OKAY?

577
00:38:06,684 --> 00:38:11,873
I'M A REAL NEW YORKER, CHE.
I'M FROM LONG ISLAND, CHE.

578
00:38:11,873 --> 00:38:15,357
>> LONG ISLAND ISN'T IN NEW YORK
CITY.
YOU CAN'T EVEN VOTE IN THIS
ELECTION.

579
00:38:15,357 --> 00:38:20,239
>> WELL, REALLY?
HOW COME I VOTED FOR CUOMO IN
THE PRIMARY 48 TIMES, CHE?

580
00:38:20,239 --> 00:38:22,221
>> I DON'T KNOW BUT THAT'S
ILLEGAL.

581
00:38:22,221 --> 00:38:24,157
>> YOU KNOW WHAT SHOULD BE ILLEGAL, CHE,

582
00:38:24,157 --> 00:38:28,660
ALL OF MAMDANI'S
SOCIALIST POLICIES, FREE BUSES,

RENT FREEZE, UNIVERSAL CHILD
CARE?

584
00:38:31,676 --> 00:38:36,063
YOU KNOW, I READ THAT MAMDANI
HIMSELF SAID THAT HE'S GOING TO ACT --

585
00:38:36,063 --> 00:38:39,781
ENACT SHARIA LAW IN THE
CITY.

586

SHARIA LAW.

587
00:38:42,282 --> 00:38:45,852
HE CAN'T DO THAT, CHE.
I KNOW SHARIA.

588
00:38:45,852 --> 00:38:47,866
SHE'S MY NAIL TECH.

589

1106
00:59:37,346 --> 00:59:38,712
DON'T TALK ABOUT MY BODY.

AREOLAS.

1111

1112
00:59:49,658 --> 00:59:49,956
HOME.

1113

DID IT EVER OCCUR TO YOU I'M

1114
00:59:51,660 --> 00:59:53,427
GETTING BULLIED AT SCHOOL?

1115

THE BLOCK.

NO, EVERYTHING IS FINE.

1135
01:00:23,258 --> 01:00:25,792
IT'S REALLY, REALLY GOOD.

1136
01:00:25,794 --> 01:00:26,193
YEAH, OKAY.

REALITY.

RAISING TWO KIDS.

TAKING CARE OF MY AGING PARENTS.

1157

01:01:43,105 --> 01:01:44,771
THAT IS SO INFECTED.

1174

>> NICE.

1191
01:02:29,818 --> 01:02:32,185
SO, YOU GUYS MADE THE OPENING

1192
01:02:32,187 --> 01:02:35,055
THEME FOR "SEVERANCE," ONE OF

1193
01:02:35,057 --> 01:02:36,556
THE MOST ICONIC TITLE SONGS OF

1194
01:02:36,558 --> 01:02:37,457
THE DECADE.

1195
01:02:37,459 --> 01:02:47,200
LET'S HEAR A LITTLE BIT.

1196
01:02:47,202 --> 01:02:48,902
>> HAUNTING STUFF.

1197
01:02:48,904 --> 01:02:50,871
I WOULD LOVE FOR YOU TO TELL US,

1198
01:02:50,873 --> 01:02:51,705
WHERE DID IT START?

1199
01:02:51,707 --> 01:02:52,873
>> WELL, WE HAD SOME

1200
01:02:52,875 --> 01:02:54,708
CONVERSATIONS ABOUT STORY AND

1201
01:02:54,710 --> 01:02:55,909
THE DARK TONE OF THE SHOW.

1202
01:02:55,911 --> 01:02:56,343
>> YEAH.

1203
01:02:56,345 --> 01:02:58,378
WE TOOK THAT AND WE MADE A FIRST

1204
01:02:58,380 --> 01:02:58,678
DRAFT.

1205
01:02:58,680 --> 01:03:00,180
>> WELL, WE WOULD LOVE TO HEAR

1206
01:03:00,182 --> 01:03:00,947
THAT FIRST DRAFT.

1207
01:03:00,949 --> 01:03:03,717
COULD YOU PLAY IT FOR US?

1208
01:03:03,719 --> 01:03:04,784
>> CERTAINLY.

1209
01:03:04,786 --> 01:03:07,053
# LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT A THING

1210
01:03:07,055 --> 01:03:08,121
CALLED SEVERANCE #

1211
01:03:08,123 --> 01:03:10,490
>> TAKE A BIG KNIFE AND CUT YOUR

1212
01:03:10,492 --> 01:03:12,325
BRAIN IN HALF #

1213
01:03:12,327 --> 01:03:13,960
# ONE HALF FOR WORK, ONE HALF

1214
01:03:13,962 --> 01:03:17,163
FOR SEX, TUNE IN, SIT DOWN, IT'S

1215
01:03:17,165 --> 01:03:18,899
SEVERANCE #

1216
01:03:19,501 --> 01:03:20,667
>> ANYONE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS?

1217
01:03:20,669 --> 01:03:21,201
>> YEAH.

1218
01:03:21,203 --> 01:03:23,336
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO PUT THIS

1219
01:03:23,338 --> 01:03:23,770
RESPECTFULLY.

1220
01:03:23,772 --> 01:03:25,238
SO, I GUESS I WON'T TRY.

1221
01:03:25,240 --> 01:03:28,708
WHY DID YOU MAKE THAT?

1222
01:03:28,710 --> 01:03:30,043
>> THESE DAYS EVERY OPENING SONG

1223
01:03:30,045 --> 01:03:32,479
IS A CREEPY, MOODY INSTRUMENTAL.

1224
01:03:32,481 --> 01:03:33,446
WHAT HAPPENED TO TELLING PEOPLE

1225
01:03:33,448 --> 01:03:35,148
THE PLOT OF THE SHOW?

1226
01:03:35,150 --> 01:03:36,783
>> WHAT IS THE SHOW?

1227
01:03:36,785 --> 01:03:38,518
WHERE IS THE SHOW?

1228
01:03:38,520 --> 01:03:40,453
SHE WAS WORKING AT A BRIDAL SHOP

1229
01:03:40,455 --> 01:03:42,455
IN FLUSHING QUEENS.

1230
01:03:42,457 --> 01:03:43,023
AND BOOM.

1231
01:03:43,025 --> 01:03:46,526
I'M TRANSPORTED TO THE NANNY.

1232
01:03:46,528 --> 01:03:49,763
>> BUT THAT'S NOT THE PLOT OF

1233
01:03:49,765 --> 01:03:50,130
SEVERANCE.

1234
01:03:50,132 --> 01:03:51,398
THEY DON'T TAKE A BIG KNIFE AND

1235
01:03:51,400 --> 01:03:52,265
CHOP YOUR BRAIN IN HALF.

1236
01:03:52,267 --> 01:03:53,900
>> ALSO YOU SAID ONE HALF FOR

1237
01:03:53,902 --> 01:03:54,200
WORK.

1238
01:03:54,202 --> 01:03:55,335
ONE HALF FOR SEX.

1239
01:03:55,337 --> 01:03:58,138
THAT'S NOT WHAT SEVERANCE IS.

1240
01:03:58,140 --> 01:04:00,373
>> PERMISSION TO USE CORPORAL

1241
01:04:00,375 --> 01:04:02,208
PUNISHMENT ON HER?

1242
01:04:02,210 --> 01:04:03,410
>> UNFORTUNATELY NO.

1243
01:04:03,412 --> 01:04:05,078
YOU GUYS ALSO DID THE OPENING

1244
01:04:05,080 --> 01:04:06,846
FOR "THE PITT."

1245
01:04:06,848 --> 01:04:07,614
TRULY HAUNTING.

1246
01:04:07,616 --> 01:04:09,616
I WOULD LOVE TO HEAR ABOUT THAT

1247
01:04:09,618 --> 01:04:09,983
PROCESS.

1248
01:04:09,985 --> 01:04:12,552
>> WELL, IT WAS PRETTY STRAIGHT

1249
01:04:12,554 --> 01:04:12,886
FORWARD.

1250
01:04:12,888 --> 01:04:13,653
THE PRODUCERS DESCRIBED A SHOW

1251
01:04:13,655 --> 01:04:15,221
ABOUT THE TRAUMA FACED BY E.R.

1252
01:04:15,223 --> 01:04:15,889
WORKERS IN PITTSBURGH.

1253
01:04:15,891 --> 01:04:20,560
>> SO WE USED THAT AND CAME ONE

1254
01:04:20,562 --> 01:04:20,860
THIS.

1255
01:04:20,862 --> 01:04:22,896
# PITTSBURGH IS THE PLACE TO

1256
01:04:22,898 --> 01:04:23,296
BE #

1257
01:04:23,298 --> 01:04:25,365
# BRIDGES AS FAR AS THE EYE CAN

1258
01:04:25,367 --> 01:04:25,732
SEE #

1259
01:04:25,734 --> 01:04:30,904
# A BRIDGE, A BRIDGE, A BRIDGE A

1260
01:04:30,906 --> 01:04:31,471
BRIDGE #

1261
01:04:31,473 --> 01:04:34,541
# WELL TO "THE PITT" #

1262
01:04:34,543 --> 01:04:36,509
>>> ANYONE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ON

1263
01:04:36,511 --> 01:04:36,810

>> OH, TEACH, PLEASE LET ME PUT

1271
01:04:50,892 --> 01:04:52,192

1281
01:05:08,377 --> 01:05:08,808
INSTRUMENTAL?

1282
