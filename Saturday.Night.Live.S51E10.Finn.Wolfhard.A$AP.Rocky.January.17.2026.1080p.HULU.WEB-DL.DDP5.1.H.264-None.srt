1
00:00:01,052 --> 00:00:05,506
>>> AND NOW, A MESSAGE FROM THE
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.

2
00:00:05,466 --> 00:00:07,924
HELLO

3
00:00:07,924 --> 00:00:09,239
>> HAPPY NEW YEAR.

4
00:00:09,239 --> 00:00:13,785
I HOPE EVERYONE HAD A NICE
HOLIDAY AND GOT WHAT THEY WANTED
FOR CHRISTMAS.

5
00:00:13,785 --> 00:00:15,165
I GOT WHAT I WANTED.

6
00:00:15,165 --> 00:00:19,179
MY VERY OWN SOMEONE ELSE'S NOBEL
PRIZE!

7
00:00:19,179 --> 00:00:21,547
WHICH I'LL CHERISH.

8
00:00:21,547 --> 00:00:25,041
AND IN MY STOCKING I GOT MADURO!

9
00:00:25,041 --> 00:00:26,558
NICOLAS MADURO.

10
00:00:26,558 --> 00:00:28,373
WE DID A REVERSE SANTA ON HIM.

11
00:00:28,373 --> 00:00:31,815
WE CAME DOWN THE CHIMNEY WITH A
BAG AND TOOK HIM AWAY.

12
00:00:31,815 --> 00:00:37,545
ANYWAY, I'M HERE TODAY TO CATCH
YOU UP ON ALL THE EXCITING
THINGS WE'VE BEEN DOING,

13
00:00:37,545 --> 00:00:42,097
AND
I'LL BE JOINED BY MY CABINET, MY
LITTLE CABINET OF CURIOSITIES,

14
00:00:42,097 --> 00:00:45,699
MY FREAKS, VARIOUS MONSTERS AND
NIGHTMARES

15
00:00:45,699 --> 00:00:49,362
FROM THE TWISTED MIND
OF GUILLERMO DEL TRUMP.

16
00:00:49,362 --> 00:00:53,629
WE'VE GOT LITTLE MARCO AND J.D.
VANCE.

17
00:00:53,629 --> 00:00:56,690
YEAH, YOU CAN CLAP FOR THEM,
THEY'RE NICE BOYS.

18
00:00:56,690 --> 00:00:58,429
THEY DO WHAT THEY'RE TOLD.

19
00:00:58,429 --> 00:01:00,894
I THINK STEPHEN MILLER'S IN HERE
SOMEWHERE,

20
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:03,343
BUT HE'S ON THE
CEILING.

21
00:01:03,343 --> 00:01:05,418
SOMEONE BROUGHT A BIBLE IN HERE,

22
00:01:05,418 --> 00:01:08,599
AND HE JUST SORT OF SCAMPERED
RIGHT UP THE WALL ONTO THE
CEILING.

23
00:01:08,599 --> 00:01:10,308
MAYBE WE'LL GET HIM DOWN IN A
MOMENT.

24
00:01:10,308 --> 00:01:15,017
THESE GUYS ARE GREAT.
THEY'RE HELPING ME DO SO MANY LEGAL-ISH THINGS

25
00:01:15,017 --> 00:01:18,857
TO TRY TO GET
PEOPLE TO STOP TALKING ABOUT
EPSTEIN.

26
00:01:19,033 --> 00:01:21,429
OH, MARCO'S PASSING ME A NOTE
HERE.

27
00:01:21,429 --> 00:01:25,797
"DON'T READ THIS OUT LOUD, BUT"
MAYBE DON'T TALK ABOUT THAT.

28
00:01:25,797 --> 00:01:28,555
ALSO, DO YOU LIKE ME?
CIRCLE YES OR NO.

29
00:01:28,555 --> 00:01:31,945
MARCO, I'M GOING TO NEED A THIRD
OPTION.

30
00:01:31,945 --> 00:01:35,516
MARCO'S FROM CUBA, AND CUBA IS
NEXT.

31
00:01:35,516 --> 00:01:41,256
SO MARCO, WHILE YOU'RE HERE,
COULD YOU SAY A FEW WORDS TO THE
PEOPLE OF CUBA?

32
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:47,059
>> NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
NOT IN HERE, BIG GUY.

33
00:01:47,059 --> 00:01:48,771
NO, NO, NO, I DIDN'T LIKE THAT
AT ALL.

34
00:01:48,771 --> 00:01:51,224
YOU'RE DRIVING IN THE WRONG
DIRECTION, HONEY.

35
00:01:51,224 --> 00:01:56,701
NOW, LET'S GET A FEW WORDS FROM
MY VICE PRESIDENT, J.D. VANCE.

36
00:01:56,701 --> 00:02:00,627
LOOK, IT'S J.D., GOT A MAKEOVER.
LOOK AT THAT.

37
00:02:00,903 --> 00:02:03,222
HE'S A NEW AND IMPROVED J.D.,

38
00:02:03,222 --> 00:02:07,842
LOOK.
HE'S GOT THE EYESHADOW LOOKING
VERY ON UNFLEET TODAY.

39
00:02:07,842 --> 00:02:11,038
WE'RE DOING THINGS FROM 2016.
REMEMBER 2016?

40
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:13,133
ANYWAY, GO AHEAD, J.D.

41
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:14,621
>> THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT.

42
00:02:14,621 --> 00:02:18,076
AND AMERICA, HERE'S MY MESSAGE
TO YOU.

43
00:02:18,076 --> 00:02:20,624
YOU KNOW, I CAME HERE TO DO TWO
THINGS.

44
00:02:20,624 --> 00:02:24,200
KICK BUBBLE GUM AND CHEW ASS.

45
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:27,145
AND I'M ALL OUT OF BUBBLE GUM.

46
00:02:27,145 --> 00:02:28,161
>> WELL SAID.

47
00:02:28,161 --> 00:02:31,070
NOW, J.D., WHY DON'T YOU GIVE US
AN UPDATE ON

48
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:34,252
TRENDS IN MENSWEAR,
WHATEVER THE HELL YOUR JOB IS.

49
00:02:34,252 --> 00:02:37,246
BY THE WAY, WHILE YOU'RE
TALKING, I'M JUST GOING

50
00:02:37,246 --> 00:02:42,018
TO SORT
OF WALK AROUND IN THE BACKGROUND
AND LOOK OUT WINDOWS.

51
00:02:42,018 --> 00:02:43,782
>> THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT.

52
00:02:43,782 --> 00:02:47,387
YOU KNOW, ACTUALLY, I LIKE TO
SPEND TIME TODAY

53
00:02:47,387 --> 00:02:50,114
TALKING  ABOUT THE NEW TARIFFS

54
00:02:50,114 --> 00:02:54,857
AND THOSE PEOPLE
WHO OPPOSE OUR MISSION IN GREENLAND.

55
00:02:54,857 --> 00:02:59,148
>> YOU KNOW WHAT, I SEE A
CARDINAL AND A BLUE JAY IN THE
SAME TREE.

56
00:02:59,148 --> 00:03:02,054
WOW.
YOU DON'T SEE THAT A LOT.
VERY INTERESTING.

57
00:03:02,054 --> 00:03:03,519
>> SIR, ARE YOU OKAY?

58
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:05,428
>> NO, I'M NOT.
I DON'T THINK SO.

59
00:03:05,428 --> 00:03:06,972
THANK YOU, J.D.

60
00:03:06,972 --> 00:03:09,865
NEXT UP, I'D LIKE TO BRING IN A
MEMBER OF MY CABINET

61
00:03:09,865 --> 00:03:15,159
WHO WEARS
MANY HATS IN TERMS OF
RESPONSIBILITY AND HAT.

62
00:03:15,159 --> 00:03:19,421
SECRETARY OF HOMELAND SECURITY,
KRISTI NOEM.

63
00:03:19,716 --> 00:03:24,191
>> THANK YOU.
THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT, FOR
HAVING ME.

64
00:03:24,191 --> 00:03:27,858
BEFORE WE START, I'D LIKE TO
GIVE A QUICK SHOUT-OUT TO MY
HAIR AND MAKEUP TEAM,

65
00:03:27,858 --> 00:03:29,886
WHO
ABSOLUTELY HATE ME.

66
00:03:29,886 --> 00:03:34,399
NOW, OBVIOUSLY, THERE'S BEEN
CLASHES ON BOTH SIDES IN
MINNEAPOLIS.

67
00:03:34,399 --> 00:03:37,055
HAVE WE BEEN PERFECT?
YES.

68
00:03:37,055 --> 00:03:40,682
I KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE LOOKING
AT THE SITUATION IN MINNESOTA

69
00:03:40,682 --> 00:03:44,037
ARE WONDERING THE SAME THING.
CAN I JOIN I.C.E.?

70
00:03:44,037 --> 00:03:48,478
LET ME ASK YOU THIS.
IS YOUR NECK WIDER THAN YOUR
HEAD?

71
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:52,127
ARE YOU CURRENTLY WEARING A
PUNISHER T-SHIRT?

72
00:03:52,127 --> 00:03:57,019
HAVE YOU EVER PUNCHED A HOLE IN
THE WALL BECAUSE YOUR SON TOOK A
DANCE CLASS?

73
00:03:57,019 --> 00:04:02,062
IF THE ANSWER IS YES, THEN GRAB
A GUN, ANY GUN, AND SADDLE UP,
BIG BOY.

74
00:04:02,062 --> 00:04:06,470
AND JUST KNOW YOU CAN ALWAYS
COUNT ON ME, BECAUSE MY LAST NAME IS NOEM

75
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:11,869
AS IN, DO I HAVE
THE SITUATION UNDER CONTROL?
NOEM, I DON'T.

76
00:04:11,869 --> 00:04:13,922
>> GREAT JOB, KRISTI,

77
00:04:13,922 --> 00:04:18,087
WOW, WOW.
WELL, FOLKS, WASN'T SHE HERE?

78
00:04:18,087 --> 00:04:22,568
WELL, NOW THAT WE'VE HEARD FROM
MY SECRETARY OF WAR ON AMERICA,

79
00:04:22,568 --> 00:04:26,519
LET'S GO AHEAD AND BRING OUT OUR
SECRETARY OF WAR WITH WORLD.

80
00:04:26,519 --> 00:04:30,069
GIVE IT UP FOR PETE HEGSETH,
EVERYBODY.

81
00:04:34,621 --> 00:04:37,058
>> YEAH!
CUT IT!

82
00:04:37,058 --> 00:04:38,760
I SAY, CUT IT!

83
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:41,924
WHAT'S UP, YOU CHODES?

84
00:04:45,983 --> 00:04:48,362
FRESH POW-POW, UGH!

85
00:04:49,556 --> 00:04:53,668
LISTEN UP!
IN CASE YOUR EARS ARE TOO FAT TO
HEAR THE NEWS,

86
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:55,447
WE WENT INTO VENEZUELA

87
00:04:55,447 --> 00:04:59,588
AND TEABAGGED THEIR
COUNTRY.

88
00:04:59,588 --> 00:05:02,416
YOU'RE LOOKING AT MANSCAPE.

89
00:05:02,691 --> 00:05:07,225
WE WENT IN, STRAIGHT-UP STOLE
THEIR PRESIDENT.
YOINK!

90
00:05:07,225 --> 00:05:12,661
ONLY NEEDED TO SEND IN A COUPLE
OF HELICOPTERS, ALL OF THEM
BLAEFRING "WELCOME TO THE JUNGLE"

91
00:05:12,661 --> 00:05:15,387
AND THE MADURO REGIME
WAS BROUGHT DOWN TO ITS

92
00:05:15,387 --> 00:05:18,809
SHA NA
NA NA THAT KNEES KNEES!

93
00:05:19,744 --> 00:05:23,930
IN FACT-BEEN ROCKING OUT WITH
OUR Cs OUT ALL OVER THE WORLD.

94
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:28,155
WE DNGED ON VENEZUELA.
NEXT WE'RE GOING TO SACK TAP
IRAN.

95
00:05:28,155 --> 00:05:31,744
GOING TO PUT THE AYATOLLAH IN
THE CUFF CHAIR.

96
00:05:31,744 --> 00:05:34,788
TELL HIM, IF AYATOLLAH YOU ONCE,

97
00:05:34,788 --> 00:05:37,237
I AYATOLLAH YOU A THOUSAND
TIMES.

98
00:05:37,237 --> 00:05:42,359
YOU DON'T DARE KILL YOUR
PROTESTERS, THAT'S OUR THING.

99
00:05:42,899 --> 00:05:47,846
REMEMBER
YOU F WITH AMERICA, WE'LL F YOU
RIGHT BACK.

100
00:05:47,846 --> 00:05:51,058
JUST LIKE IT LOOKS LIKE I'M
EFFING THIS CATTLE BELL.

101
00:05:51,058 --> 00:05:54,696
SAW IT ON A VIDEO, GOT PASSED
AROUND ONLINE

102
00:05:54,696 --> 00:05:56,918
IN A POSITIVE WAY.

103
00:05:58,806 --> 00:06:02,362
YEAH, I'M GONNA F YOU LIKE I'VE
NEVER DONE IT BEFORE

104
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:05,786
AND I'M
GOING TO FINISH WAY TOO FAST.

105
00:06:05,786 --> 00:06:08,576
- THANK
>> THANKS, HEGSETH, THAT WAS
GREAT, BUDDY.

106
00:06:08,576 --> 00:06:11,220
EVEN I KNOW YOU'RE DOING THAT
WRONG.

107
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:13,768
ALSO, MIDTERMS ARE CANCELED.

108
00:06:13,768 --> 00:06:18,140
AND LIVE FROM NEW YORK, IT'S
SATURDAY NIGHT!

109
00:08:16,313 --> 00:08:20,920
MUSICAL

110
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:25,290
HOST

111
00:08:28,128 --> 00:08:33,578
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN -- FINN
WOLFHARD!

112
00:08:51,152 --> 00:08:53,458
THANK YOU!

113
00:08:53,458 --> 00:08:55,588
THANKS.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

114
00:08:55,588 --> 00:08:57,454
I'M SO EXCITED TO BE HERE.

115
00:08:57,454 --> 00:09:00,683
THIS PAST YEAR WAS VERY
BITTERSWEET FOR ME.

116
00:09:00,683 --> 00:09:03,181
MY SHOW "STRANGER THINGS" ENDED.

117
00:09:03,181 --> 00:09:05,713
AND IT STARTED -- YEAH.

118
00:09:07,697 --> 00:09:10,281
IT STARTED WHEN I WAS 12,

119
00:09:10,281 --> 00:09:15,788
AND I GOT TO TELL YOU, IT FEELS SO
AMAZING
THAT 400 MILLION PEOPLE GOT TO WATCH ME

120
00:09:15,788 --> 00:09:17,773
GO THROUGH
PUBERTY.

121
00:09:17,773 --> 00:09:19,718
WHAT A DREAM.

122
00:09:19,718 --> 00:09:23,866
SOMEBODY ON A REDDIT ACTUALLY
FIGURED OUT THE EXACT MOMENT IT HAPPENED,

123
00:09:23,866 --> 00:09:25,374
AND I THINK WE HAVE A
CLIP.

124
00:09:25,374 --> 00:09:27,114
>> ARE YOU FEELING ANY BETTER?

125
00:09:27,114 --> 00:09:31,642
DON'T WORRY, WHEN ALL THIS IS
OVER, YOU WON'T HAVE TO KEEP
EATING JUNK FOOD AND LEFTOVERS
LIKE A DOG ANYMORE.

126
00:09:31,642 --> 00:09:34,955
MY MOM, SHE LOOK PRETTY AWESOME
TOO.

127
00:09:35,432 --> 00:09:39,059
>> YEP.
MY VOICE CHANGED ON CAMERA,

128
00:09:39,059 --> 00:09:41,188
MY
FIRST KISS WAS ON CAMERA, AND --

129
00:09:41,188 --> 00:09:46,776
I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M ADMITTING
THIS BUT THE FIRST TIME I
LEARNED WHAT A WOMAN LOOKS LIKE
DOWN THERE

130
00:09:46,776 --> 00:09:50,479
WAS ON CAMERA, AS
WELL.
SO WE HAVE ANOTHER CLIP, I
THINK.

131
00:09:58,741 --> 00:10:00,079
KREP.

132
00:10:00,079 --> 00:10:02,475
AND LOOK, LOOK, LOOK, LOOK.

133
00:10:02,475 --> 00:10:07,879
A LOT OF PEOPLE STILL SEE ME AS
THE KID FROM "STRANGER THINGS,"
RIGHT?

134
00:10:07,879 --> 00:10:09,607
I'M 23 NOW.

135
00:10:09,607 --> 00:10:14,817
AND I'M PROUD TO OFFICIALLY
ANNOUNCE THAT I AM -- A MAN.

136
00:10:14,817 --> 00:10:17,831
OH, YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.

137
00:10:17,831 --> 00:10:20,778
THINGS ARE DIFFERENT NOW.

138
00:10:20,778 --> 00:10:24,881
LIKE, FOR EXAMPLE -- I HAVE
FACIAL HAIR.

139
00:10:24,881 --> 00:10:27,266
CAN WE ZOOM IN ON IT?

140
00:10:27,266 --> 00:10:31,804
OH, YEAH.
THERE SHE IS.

141
00:10:31,804 --> 00:10:37,179
HEY, MIGHT ONLY SEE ONE HAIR,
BUT PARTY STARTS WHEN THE FIRST
GUEST ARRIVES.

142
00:10:37,179 --> 00:10:40,121
WHAT'S A PARTY WITHOUT SOME
ALCOHOL?

143
00:10:40,121 --> 00:10:43,645
NOW THAT I'M A MAN, I'D LIKE TO
TRY IT NOW, PLEASE.

144
00:10:43,645 --> 00:10:45,364
COULD I GET SOME ALCOHOL IN A
CUP?

145
00:10:45,364 --> 00:10:48,656
>> YEAH, I GOT YOU.
>> OH, THANK YOU.
THANKS, MAN.

146
00:10:48,656 --> 00:10:50,932
- GLO
- I LOVED YOUR STAND-UP SESSION,
BY THE WAY.

147
00:10:50,932 --> 00:10:54,196

831
00:36:07,616 --> 00:36:09,783
YEAR SINCE WE GOT BACK TOGETHER

832
00:36:09,785 --> 00:36:11,685
WITH TRUMP AFTER TAKING A BREAK.

833
00:36:11,687 --> 00:36:13,753
AND THERE ARE SIGNS THAT THERE

834
00:36:13,755 --> 00:36:15,622
STILL MAY BE PROBLEMS WITH THE

835
00:36:15,624 --> 00:36:16,056
RELATIONSHIP.

836
00:36:16,458 --> 00:36:17,490
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU REMEMBER,

837
00:36:17,492 --> 00:36:19,426
BUT TRUMP PROMISED US AMERICA

838
00:36:19,428 --> 00:36:19,793
FIRST.

839
00:36:19,795 --> 00:36:22,429
YET IT'S ONLY OUR ONE-YEAR

843
00:36:26,001 --> 00:36:27,500
THIS WEEK, TRUMP DECLARED

844
00:36:27,502 --> 00:36:30,036
HIMSELF THE ACTING PRESIDENT OF

845
00:36:30,038 --> 00:36:30,403
VENEZUELA.

846
00:36:30,405 --> 00:36:32,505
BY NEXT WEEK, HE WILL BE THE

INTERIM AYATOLLAH OF IRAN.

848

GOAL, HEAD REINDEER OF

850

GREENLAND.

851

IN FACT, A CONGRESSMAN HAS

852
00:36:40,249 --> 00:36:42,048
INTRODUCED A BILL TO MAKE

853

WOW, OKAY.

COMING.

869
00:37:11,747 --> 00:37:13,847
WHICH IS A PHRASE HE STOLE FROM

870
00:37:13,849 --> 00:37:14,581
THAT GUY WHO'S ALWAYS POINTING

871

BUT IF I.C.E. AGENTS LISTENED TO

WOULD BE GETTING THOSE CHECKS

879

BECOMES THE PRINCESS OF TOILET

1470
00:57:24,592 --> 00:57:24,890
PAPER.

1471
00:57:24,892 --> 00:57:26,491
WHAT WOULD THAT EVEN BE?

1472
00:57:26,493 --> 00:57:27,559

SHE PANTSED ME IN A STARBUCKS.

1480
00:57:40,608 --> 00:57:43,208

00:57:43,210 --> 00:57:43,942
AND -- YEAH, I THINK SHE'S THE

1482
00:57:43,944 --> 00:57:44,243

DUDE, SHE'S DISGUSTING.

1487
00:57:50,484 --> 00:57:56,421

>> 101 STORIES.

1658
01:03:55,916 --> 01:03:58,783
1,667 FEET.

1659
01:03:58,785 --> 01:03:59,751
NO HARNESS.

1660
01:03:59,753 --> 01:04:01,186
NO SAFETY NET.

1661
01:04:01,188 --> 01:04:02,420
MY WHOLE LIFE HAS BEEN LEADING

1662
01:04:02,422 --> 01:04:05,490
ME TO THIS CLIMB.

1663
01:04:05,492 --> 01:04:07,259
>> YEAH, NO, I NEVER ROCK

1664
01:04:07,261 --> 01:04:08,193
CLIMBED BEFORE.

1665
01:04:08,195 --> 01:04:08,927
BUT THANKFULLY, A BUILDING AIN'T

1666
01:04:08,929 --> 01:04:09,995
NO ROCK.

1667
01:04:12,599 --> 01:04:13,965
>> I THINK I'VE GOTTEN USED TO

1668
01:04:13,967 --> 01:04:17,602
FEAR OVER THE YEARS.

1669
01:04:17,604 --> 01:04:19,537
IT'S AN EVER-PRESENT PART OF

1670
01:04:19,539 --> 01:04:20,405
CLIMBING.

1671
01:04:20,407 --> 01:04:21,940
OCCASIONALLY THINGS JUST HAPPEN,

1672
01:04:21,942 --> 01:04:22,674
THOUGH, NO MATTER HOW MUCH YOU

1673
01:04:22,676 --> 01:04:24,442
PREPARE.

1674
01:04:24,444 --> 01:04:28,680
>> THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING.

1675
01:04:28,682 --> 01:04:28,947
WHY?

1676
01:04:28,949 --> 01:04:31,650
I NEVER BEEN INSIDE A VOICE-OVER

1677
01:04:31,652 --> 01:04:31,983
BEFORE.

1678
01:04:31,985 --> 01:04:35,654
¶ LA LA LA LA LA LA ¶

1679
01:04:36,056 --> 01:04:37,255
>> AND OF COURSE, IT'S AN HONOR

1680
01:04:37,257 --> 01:04:38,023
TO BE DOING THIS IN THE CITY OF

1681
01:04:38,025 --> 01:04:39,591
TAIPEI.

1682
01:04:39,593 --> 01:04:41,726
>> YEAH, I'M EXCITED TOO.

1683
01:04:41,728 --> 01:04:47,098
I NEVER BEEN WITH A TAIPANESE

1684
01:04:47,100 --> 01:04:49,034
WOMAN.

1685
01:04:49,436 --> 01:04:50,168
>> I'M SO PROUD OF MY HUSBAND

1686
01:04:50,170 --> 01:04:50,669
FOR DOING THIS.

1687
01:04:50,671 --> 01:04:51,670
A LOT OF PEOPLE WOULDN'T BECAUSE

1688
01:04:51,672 --> 01:04:53,905
THEY WANT TO BE AROUND FOR THEIR

1689
01:04:53,907 --> 01:04:54,239
FAMILY.

1690
01:04:54,241 --> 01:04:56,408
BUT THAT'S NOT HIM.

1691
01:04:56,410 --> 01:04:57,842
THE EMOTION I HAVE ABOUT THIS IS

1692
01:04:57,844 --> 01:05:01,046
PROUDNESS.

1693
01:05:01,048 --> 01:05:03,315
>> I LEGIT DON'T THINK REGGIE

1694
01:05:03,317 --> 01:05:06,217
CARES IF HE LIVES OR DIES.

1695
01:05:06,219 --> 01:05:07,185
HONESTLY, HE'S BEEN HOLDING ON

1696
01:05:07,187 --> 01:05:09,020
BY A THREAD NOW FOR A LONG TIME

1697
01:05:09,022 --> 01:05:09,287
NOW.

1698
01:05:09,289 --> 01:05:12,057
WHEN HE FOUND OUT TACO BELL WAS

1699
01:05:12,059 --> 01:05:13,758
DISCONTINUING THE BAJA BLAST

1700
01:05:13,760 --> 01:05:14,025
PIE?

1701
01:05:14,027 --> 01:05:16,261
HE STOOD AND UP SAID, "THERE IT

1702
01:05:16,263 --> 01:05:17,996
GOES, MY LAST REASON NOT TO RISK

1703
01:05:17,998 --> 01:05:18,330
IT ALL."

1704
01:05:22,302 --> 01:05:23,935
HE SIGNED UP TO CLIMB A BUILDING

1705
01:05:23,937 --> 01:05:26,071
WITH NO ROPES?

1706
01:05:26,073 --> 01:05:28,039
ALSO, REGGIE LITERALLY HAS

1707
01:05:28,041 --> 01:05:28,440
NARCOLEPSY.

1708
01:05:28,842 --> 01:05:32,243
>> WAIT, DID I WIN?

1709
01:05:32,245 --> 01:05:32,911
>> THE STAKES ARE LIFE AND

1710
01:05:32,913 --> 01:05:35,747
DEATH.

1711
01:05:35,749 --> 01:05:38,683
THE BIGGEST OBSTACLE IS PROBABLY

1712
01:05:38,685 --> 01:05:39,417
GOING TO BE THE WIND UP AT THE

1713
01:05:39,419 --> 01:05:41,486
HIGHER LEVELS.

1714
01:05:41,488 --> 01:05:42,954
>> I THINK THE BIGGEST OBSTACLE

1715
01:05:42,956 --> 01:05:44,155
FOR ME IS GOING TO BE THIS.

1716
01:05:48,128 --> 01:05:49,327
>> BUT I'M READY.

1717
01:05:49,329 --> 01:05:51,196
I'VE BEEN SCOUTING THE BUILDING.

1718
01:05:51,198 --> 01:05:53,398
I'VE BEEN WORKING TRAINING RUNS

1719
01:05:53,400 --> 01:05:54,866
EVERY DAY.

1720
01:05:54,868 --> 01:05:55,500
AND I'VE GOT CUSTOM-MADE

1721
01:05:55,502 --> 01:05:57,268
CLIMBING SHOES.

1722
01:05:57,270 --> 01:05:59,471
>> YEAH, I THINK I'M GOING TO

1723
01:05:59,473 --> 01:06:00,872
MAKE SOMETHING HAPPEN WITH

1724
01:06:00,874 --> 01:06:01,172
THESE.

1725
01:06:04,478 --> 01:06:09,547
>> I'VE NEVER MET YOU, SIR.

1726
01:06:09,549 --> 01:06:12,517
>> OF COURSE, IT IS ALWAYS

1727
01:06:12,519 --> 01:06:12,817
SCARY.

1728
01:06:12,819 --> 01:06:13,885
BUT HE'S A PROFESSIONAL.

1729
01:06:13,887 --> 01:06:17,655
HE'S PREPARED FOR THIS.

1730
01:06:17,657 --> 01:06:18,390
>> I CAN'T STRESS HOW UNPREPARED

1731
01:06:18,392 --> 01:06:21,326
REGGIE IS.

1732
01:06:21,328 --> 01:06:22,093
I'VE SEEN THIS MAN TAKE AN UBER

1733
01:06:22,095 --> 01:06:24,596
TO THE BUS STOP.

1734
01:06:24,598 --> 01:06:26,831
THIS MAN EATS SO MUCH WHITE

1735
01:06:26,833 --> 01:06:27,899
CASTLE, THEY HAVE HIS PICTURE ON

1736
01:06:27,901 --> 01:06:28,333
THEIR WEBSITE.

1737
01:06:31,371 --> 01:06:33,004
>> I'M A LITTLE NERVOUS, ALEX.

1738
01:06:33,006 --> 01:06:33,805
>> I KNOW.

1739
01:06:33,807 --> 01:06:35,373
BUT IT'S GOING TO BE FINE.

1740
01:06:35,375 --> 01:06:36,674
ANYTHING HAPPENS TO ME, I WANT

1741
01:06:36,676 --> 01:06:40,645
YOU TO KNOW THAT I LOVE YOU.

1742
01:06:40,647 --> 01:06:42,881
>> IF SOMETHING HAPPENS TO ME,

1743
01:06:42,883 --> 01:06:44,949
PLEASE TELL SHEILA FROM FACEBOOK

1744
01:06:44,951 --> 01:06:46,050
DATING, I'M NOT GOING TO MAKE IT

1745
01:06:46,052 --> 01:06:46,584
TO THE OLIVE GARDEN.

1746
01:06:49,122 --> 01:06:50,121
>> FINE, YEAH.

1747
01:06:50,123 --> 01:06:50,688
WAIT, WHO IS SHEILA?

1748
01:06:50,690 --> 01:06:52,690
DON'T YOU HAVE A WIFE?

1749
01:06:55,729 --> 01:06:58,563
>> IT WILL BE THE BIGGEST FREE

1750
01:06:58,565 --> 01:07:00,265
SOLO CLIMB EVER, AND THERE'S NO

1751
01:07:00,267 --> 01:07:02,934
TELLING WHAT WILL HAPPEN.

1752
01:07:02,936 --> 01:07:03,701
>> I'VE GOT A PRETTY GOOD SENSE

1753
01:07:03,703 --> 01:07:06,271
OF WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN.

1754
01:07:06,273 --> 01:07:07,972
>> SO TUNE IN JANUARY 23rd.

1755
01:07:07,974 --> 01:07:10,542
>> WAIT.

1756
01:07:10,544 --> 01:07:14,913
DID YOU START ALREADY?

1757
01:07:15,315 --> 01:07:20,318
>> HELP, HELP!

1758
01:07:43,976 --> 01:08:00,592
ONE OF THE BEST WEEKS OF MY LIFE

1759
01:08:00,594 --> 01:08:04,529
AND ONE OF THE BEST CASTS EVER.

1760
01:08:04,531 --> 01:08:06,197
THIS IS A DREAM COME TRUE.

1761
01:08:06,199 --> 01:08:06,764
THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH.

1762
01:08:06,766 --> 01:08:11,803
LOVE YOU ALL, THANK YOU!
