1
00:00:01,141 --> 00:00:05,004
>>> ON A COLD DECEMBER NIGHT
HIGH ABOVE THE EARTH

2
00:00:05,004 --> 00:00:08,958
FLIES A BIG
JOLLY MAN OF CONSIDERABLE GIRTH.

3
00:00:08,958 --> 00:00:12,552
MAKING HIS WAY TO EVERY HOME UNDER THE SUN

4
00:00:12,552 --> 00:00:17,552
IN HIS MAGICAL
SLEIGH -- AIR FORCE ONE.

5
00:00:21,447 --> 00:00:25,680
>> I KNOW YOU HAVE QUESTIONS FOR
THE PRESIDENT BUT IT'S VERY
LATE.

6
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,610
HE'S EXHAUSTED.
HIS BRAIN IS ALL OVER THE PLACE.

7
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:32,035
SO UNFORTUNATELY, HE CAN'T WAIT
TO TALK TO YOU.

8
00:00:32,035 --> 00:00:35,196
>> HELLO, EVERYBODY.
HOW ARE YOU?
IT'S ME.

9
00:00:35,196 --> 00:00:37,741
YES, IT'S YOUR FAVORITE
PRESIDENT.

10
00:00:37,741 --> 00:00:40,129
HIDING BEHIND MY CURTAIN, OOH!

11
00:00:40,129 --> 00:00:45,999
BEHIND THE CURTAIN, SOMETHING I
ENJOYED DOING AT MICE TEEN USA
1997.

12
00:00:45,999 --> 00:00:47,494
I'M READY TO TALK.

13
00:00:47,494 --> 00:00:51,921
THIS IS EXCITING.
TONIGHT I TOOK BOTH AN AMBIEN
AND AN ADDERALL,

14
00:00:51,921 --> 00:00:53,385
SO WE'RE GOING
TO SEE WHICH ONE WINS.

15
00:00:53,385 --> 00:00:55,172
>> JUST A FEW QUESTIONS, PLEASE.

16
00:00:55,172 --> 00:00:57,889
>> HOW GREAT IS CAROLYN LEAVITT,

17
00:00:57,889 --> 00:01:00,461
WE LOVE HER, BEAUTIFUL FACE.

18
00:01:00,461 --> 00:01:02,584
THOSE LIPS THAT DON'T QUIT.

19
00:01:02,584 --> 00:01:07,826
PRETTY AMAZING THAT I CAN OPENLY
SIMP OVER MY YOUNG, BLOND
SUBORDINATE.

20
00:01:07,826 --> 00:01:09,967
IT'S GIVING MICHIGAN FOOTBALL
COACH.

21
00:01:09,967 --> 00:01:13,623
LET'S GET A CLOSEUP ON HER MOUTH,

22
00:01:13,623 --> 00:01:18,606
IT'S ONE OF MY -- I LOVE
THAT MOUTH.

23
00:01:18,606 --> 00:01:20,795
PEOPLE NEED THIS SEE THIS.
LOOK AT THOSE LIPS,

24
00:01:20,795 --> 00:01:22,912
THEY GO BOP,
BOP, BOP LIKE A MACHINE GUN.

25
00:01:22,912 --> 00:01:25,291
JUST
>> OH, THANK YOU, THANK YOU.

26
00:01:25,291 --> 00:01:27,896
>> I'M OBSESSED WITH THIS WOMAN.

27
00:01:27,896 --> 00:01:31,909
SHE LIKED IT BECAUSE I'M VERY
NICE TO WOMEN.

28
00:01:31,909 --> 00:01:35,116
YES, YOU HAVE A QUESTION, YOU
NASTY, HORRIBLE WITCH.

29
00:01:35,116 --> 00:01:37,892
>> MY NAME IS KAITLAN COLLINS, SIR,

30
00:01:37,892 --> 00:01:40,563
AND THAT'S ONE OF THE NICER
THINGS THAT YOU'VE CALLED ME.

31
00:01:40,563 --> 00:01:44,688
SIR, AT YOUR RALLIES YOU
ADDRESSED THE AFFORDABILITY
CRISIS.

32
00:01:44,688 --> 00:01:46,856
ARE YOU ADMITTING THAT IT'S A
SERIOUS PROBLEM?

33
00:01:46,856 --> 00:01:48,896
>> NO, IT'S A MADE-UP TERM,
AFFORDABILITY.

34
00:01:48,896 --> 00:01:52,262
THE ECONOMY IS VERY STRONG.
EVERYONE'S FINE.

35
00:01:52,262 --> 00:01:56,164
FROM THE BILLIONAIRES ALL THE
WAY DOWN TO THE POOR, POOR
MILLIONAIRES.

36
00:01:56,164 --> 00:01:58,169
WHO WE'RE PRAYING FOR EVERY NIGHT,

37
00:01:58,169 --> 00:02:02,471
WHICH IS A MIRACLE
BECAUSE I INHERITED A MESS OF AN ECONOMY

38
00:02:02,471 --> 00:02:04,861
FROM THE AWFUL
PRESIDENTS THAT CAME BEFORE ME.

39
00:02:04,861 --> 00:02:07,614
LIKE BIDEN AND TRUMP.
THIS GUY.

40
00:02:07,614 --> 00:02:10,314
THIS GUY DID A REAL NUMBER ON
THIS PLACE.

41
00:02:10,314 --> 00:02:12,794
NOW, CAN A MAN ASK ME A
QUESTION?

42
00:02:12,794 --> 00:02:15,427
YOU'RE KIND OF A MAN, WHAT YOU
GOT?

43
00:02:15,427 --> 00:02:18,630
>> OKAY, MR. PRESIDENT, ANY
COMMENT ON THE OIL TANKER

44
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:20,925
YOU
SEIZED OFF THE COAST OF
VENEZUELA ON WEDNESDAY?

45
00:02:20,925 --> 00:02:24,182
>> YES, WE'RE DOING PIRATE NOW,
ARGGH!

46
00:02:24,601 --> 00:02:28,330
INTERESTING, LAST WEEK I SAID
SOMALIS WERE GARBAGE.

47
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:31,532
NOW WE'RE STEALING THE SHIPS.
IRONIC, ISN'T IT?

48
00:02:31,532 --> 00:02:34,444
ALANIS, SHE'S GREAT IN "DOGMA."
SHE'S AT THE END.

49
00:02:34,444 --> 00:02:38,443
WITH REGARD TO TANKER, I'M CAPTAIN NOW,

50
00:02:38,443 --> 00:02:41,915
REMEMBER CAPTAIN
PHILLIPS?
I'M CAPTAIN, I LOVE THAT LINE.

51
00:02:41,915 --> 00:02:45,548
YOU KNOW, CAPTAIN PHILLIPS, ONE
OF MY FAVORITE CAP TINS AFTER
CRUNCH.

52
00:02:45,549 --> 00:02:47,528
OOPS

53
00:02:47,528 --> 00:02:51,807
I PREFER WHEN IT'S ALL CRUNCH
BERRIES.

54
00:02:51,807 --> 00:02:55,795
OH-OH, METHINKS AMBIEN HAS
PULLED INTO THE LEAD.

55
00:02:55,795 --> 00:02:59,292
BUT DON'T WORRY, ADDERALL IS
STILL IN THE RACE.

56
00:02:59,292 --> 00:03:04,867
>> RIGHT.
SO YOU'LL CONTINUE TO CARRY OUT
STRIKES ON VENEZUELA IN THE
CARIBBEAN?

57
00:03:04,867 --> 00:03:06,741
>> CARRY
YES.

58
00:03:06,741 --> 00:03:09,212
AND YOU KNOW, WE'RE NOT JUST
JUST TARGETING DRUG BOATS,

59
00:03:09,212 --> 00:03:12,300
WE'RE
TARGETING SUSPECTED DRUG PLANES
AS WELL.

60
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:16,700
IN FACT, WE HAVE DECLASSIFIED
VIDEO FROM A STRIKE I CAN SHOW
YOU NOW.

61
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:19,567
DO WE HAVE THAT CLIP?
WHERE'S THE CLIP?

62
00:03:25,604 --> 00:03:27,562
>> WAS THAT SANTA?

63
00:03:27,562 --> 00:03:30,232
>> NOT ANYMORE!
NEXT QUESTION.

64
00:03:30,232 --> 00:03:32,548
>> MR. PRESIDENT, DO YOU HAVE
ANY COMMENTS

65
00:03:32,548 --> 00:03:36,045
ON THE POTENTIAL
SALE OF WARNER BROTHERS TO
NETFLIX --

66
00:03:36,045 --> 00:03:38,241
>> I DON'T KNOW WHY ANYONE WANTS
WARNERS BROTHERS.

67
00:03:38,241 --> 00:03:41,122
THEY GOT ONE OF THE WORST STUDIO
LOT TOURS IN L.A.

68
00:03:41,122 --> 00:03:44,260
YOU GO ON THAT THING, IT'S SOME
KID POINTING TO A TREE,

69
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:47,410
THE TREE
FROM PRET LITTLE LIARS, WHO
GIVES A CRAP?

70
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:52,339
I WANT TO GO TO THE GILMORE
GIRLS GAZEBO.

71
00:03:52,339 --> 00:03:55,375
THE BATMAN MUSEUM.
>> RIGHT, YES.

72
00:03:55,375 --> 00:03:59,596
COULD YOU COMMENT ON THE LATEST
BATCH OF EPSTEIN PHOTOS RELEASED
BY HOUSE DEMOCRATS?

73
00:03:59,596 --> 00:04:04,069
>> THESE PHOTOS ARE A FAKE NEWS
DEMOCRAT HOAX, OKAY?

74
00:04:04,069 --> 00:04:09,580
>> EVEN THE PICTURE OF A BOWL OF
CONDOMS WITH YOUR FACE ON THEM
AND THE TEXT "I'M HUGE"?

75
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:12,407
>> 100% LEGIT, I LOVE THOSE.

76
00:04:12,407 --> 00:04:16,476
I TOOK A LOT OF GREAT PICTURES.
I LIKE THAT BOWL.

77
00:04:16,476 --> 00:04:19,694
>> OKAY, I THINK THAT'S ENOUGH
QUESTIONS.
THE PRESIDENT REALLY NEEDS TO
REST.

78
00:04:19,694 --> 00:04:23,248
>> I HAVE TO BEGIN MY PREBEDTIME
SELF-CARE RITUAL.

79
00:04:23,248 --> 00:04:26,564
PUTTING A BANDAGE ON MY HAND AND
COVERING IT WITH MAKE UP.

80
00:04:26,564 --> 00:04:29,585
ADDING MORE LAYERS OF BANDAGE
AND MAKEUP.

81
00:04:29,585 --> 00:04:32,341
IT'S A MEDICAL LASAGNA, MAMMA
MIA.

82
00:04:32,341 --> 00:04:35,999
WE SHOULD ALL BE WORRIED ABOUT
MY HEALTH, I'M VERY ILL.

83
00:04:35,999 --> 00:04:41,623
THEN I WILL BRUSH MY TEETH
BEFORE DRIFTING OFF TO DREAM
ABOUT KAROLINE'S MOUTH.

84
00:04:41,623 --> 00:04:43,450
>> LET'S GET ONE MORE SHOT OF
IT.
>> NO.

85
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:45,049
>> I DON'T THINK THAT THEY
WANT -- OKAY.

86
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:47,126
LINE

87
00:04:47,126 --> 00:04:49,427
LIPS

88
00:04:49,427 --> 00:04:52,912
AND LIVE FROM NEW YORK, IT'S
SATURDAY NIGHT!

89
00:06:55,702 --> 00:07:00,233
MUSICAL

90
00:07:00,233 --> 00:07:04,329
HOST

91
00:07:07,687 --> 00:07:13,053
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN -- JOSH
O'CONNOR!

92
00:07:30,284 --> 00:07:33,660
>> THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK
YOU.

93
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:37,317
THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU,
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

94
00:07:37,317 --> 00:07:40,999
I'M SO HAPPY TO BE HERE.
I'M JOSH O'CONNOR.

95
00:07:40,999 --> 00:07:42,618
THANK YOU.

96
00:07:42,618 --> 00:07:48,097
AND TO THOSE OF YOU WHO KNOW MY
FACE BUT MAYBE CAN'T QUITE PLACE ME,

97
00:07:48,097 --> 00:07:51,275
NO, I AM NOT THE MOUSE FROM
FLUSHED AWAY.

98
00:07:52,588 --> 00:07:55,900
ALTHOUGH I WILL SAY, HE IS QUITE
FETCHING.

99
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:59,886
I AM AN ACTOR WHO YOU MIGHT KNOW
FROM "THE CROWN."

100
00:07:59,886 --> 00:08:02,669
YES.
FROM "CHALLENGERS."
AND OTHER...

101
00:08:02,669 --> 00:08:06,815
THANK YOU.
AND OTHER COMPETITIVE HOMOEROTIC
DRAMAS.

102
00:08:06,815 --> 00:08:10,089
YES, I KNOW I HAVE A REPUTATION
FOR BEING

103
00:08:10,089 --> 00:08:12,074
WHAT THE INTERNET
CALLS A SOFT BOY.

104
00:08:12,074 --> 00:08:15,360
I EMBROIDER.
I SCRAPBOOK.
I GARDEN.

105
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,579
I'M JUST YOUR AVERAGE, EVERYDAY,
65-YEAR-OLD WOMAN.

106
00:08:18,579 --> 00:08:21,581
AND I'M JUST TRYING TO LIVE
A QUIET LIFE.

107
00:08:21,581 --> 00:08:24,355
BUT YOU HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL
ABOUT WHAT YOU SAY,

108
00:08:24,355 --> 00:08:28,198
BECAUSE THE
PRESS WILL BLOW EVERYTHING
COMPLETELY OUT OF PROPORTION.

109
00:08:28,198 --> 00:08:31,894
LIKE ONE TIME I SAID ONE OF MY
FAVORITE MOVIES IS RATATOUILLE,

110
00:08:31,894 --> 00:08:33,669
WHICH IS TRUE,
IT'S A GREAT FILM.

111
00:08:33,669 --> 00:08:36,064
BUT I SUPPOSE FANS STARTED
PICTURING ME

112
00:08:36,064 --> 00:08:39,604
AS CHEFLING WEE
THOUGH FOR A LIVE-ACTION REMAKE.

113
00:08:39,604 --> 00:08:43,618
AND I'M NOT VERY ONLINE, SO I
DIDN'T KNOW THIS WAS A THING

114
00:08:43,618 --> 00:08:48,369
UNTIL THE PRESIDENT OF DISNEY
PIXAR PUBLICLY DECLARED

115
00:08:48,369 --> 00:08:51,851
THAT
THERE WILL NEVER BE A
LIVE-ACTION "RATATOUILLE" REMAKE

116
00:08:51,851 --> 00:08:55,336
"NO MATTER HOW MUCH JOSH"
O'CONNOR WANTS IT.

117
00:08:55,336 --> 00:09:01,069
DO YOU KNOW HOW IT FEELS TO BE
PUBLICLY REJECTED FROM A JOB I
DIDN'T EVEN WANT?

118
00:09:01,069 --> 00:09:04,988
FOR THE RECORD, I DON'T EVEN
WANT A LIVE-ACTION
RATATOUILLE.

119
00:09:04,988 --> 00:09:06,455
I DON'T HAVE THE TIME FOR IT.

120
00:09:06,455 --> 00:09:10,545
I'M ALREADY IN THE NEW "KNIVES
OUT" FILM.

121
00:09:11,378 --> 00:09:14,076
WHICH NOW THAT I'M SAYING IT OUT

122
00:09:14,076 --> 00:09:17,710
LOUD SOUNDS LIKE THE PERFECT
NAME FOR THE LIVE-ACTION
RATATOUILLE.

123
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:19,334
THAT'S NEITHER HERE NOR THERE.

124
00:09:19,334 --> 00:09:21,547
I'M AT "SNL," AND I'M SO
HONORED.

125
00:09:21,547 --> 00:09:23,416
THE CAST, THE CREW --

126
00:09:23,416 --> 00:09:26,968
SORRY, FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH, I WOULD KILL AS
LINGUINE.

127
00:09:26,968 --> 00:09:29,429
I SEE A PICTURE OF HIM --

128
00:09:29,429 --> 00:09:32,558
HIS EARS ARE HUGE,

129
00:09:32,558 --> 00:09:34,944
AND RATATOUILLE IS BASICALLY A
QUEER LOVE STORY.

130
00:09:34,944 --> 00:09:37,644
I AGREE, LET'S NOT DO IT.

131
00:09:37,644 --> 00:09:43,133
BEING AT "SNL" DURING
CHRISTMASTIME IS MAGICAL AND
JOYOUS.

132
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:46,753
AND GUYS, YOU CAN'T MAKE
RATATOUILLE UNLESS YOU HAVE
THE PERFECT CAST.

133
00:09:46,753 --> 00:09:48,518
THERE'S NO POINT.

134
00:09:48,518 --> 00:09:51,914
WHO WOULD BE THE FOOD CRITIC,
ANTON EGO?

135
00:09:51,914 --> 00:09:54,843
PERHAPS JEFF GOLDBLUM.

136
00:09:56,703 --> 00:09:58,052
NO, NO, NO.

137
00:09:58,052 --> 00:09:59,754
I MEAN, YES, BUT LATER.

138
00:09:59,754 --> 00:10:02,684
WE'VE GOT A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU
TONIGHT.
LILY ALLEN IS HERE!

139
00:10:02,684 --> 00:10:06,302
SO STICK AROUND, AND WE'LL BE
RIGHT BACK!

140
00:10:28,284 --> 00:10:31,130
NOW

141
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:34,272
IT'S "LET'S FIND LOVE!"

142
00:10:35,281 --> 00:10:38,533
>> HELLO, HELLO, AND WELCOME TO
LET'S FIND LOVE!

143
00:10:38,533 --> 00:10:40,898
I'M YOUR HOST, GARTH VADER.

144
00:10:40,898 --> 00:10:44,189
I DON'T KNOW WHY THAT ALWAYS
GETS A LAUGH, IT'S JUST MY NAME.

145
00:10:44,189 --> 00:10:46,867
BUT TODAY, ONE LUCKY MAN WILL

355
00:22:22,983 --> 00:22:27,081
I KNOW IT'S LAME, BUT I WANTED
TO DO SOMETHING CHILL WITH MY
GIRLIES.

356
00:22:27,081 --> 00:22:29,566

>> OKAY, DON'T WORRY.
I GOT YOU A DIFFERENT KIND OF
STRIPPER.

361

BOARD.

372
00:23:30,926 --> 00:23:34,744
THEY'RE THE MOST SENSITIVE MALE
STRIPPERS IN ALL THE CATSKILLS.

373
00:23:34,744 --> 00:23:39,372
>> I HATE TO BE THE GROUP

HAVE LITTLE BEANIES AND LITTLE
EARRINGS.

387
00:24:36,316 --> 00:24:38,899
I WANT THEM TO THROW ASS IN A

400
00:25:11,508 --> 00:25:13,346

SUPREME COURT.

408
00:25:52,626 --> 00:25:56,429

¶ AND I DON'T KNOW IF
YOU DO IT INTENTIONALLY

446
00:28:44,595 --> 00:28:48,826
BUT SOMEHOW YOU MAKE IT
MY FAULT ¶

447
00:28:48,826 --> 00:28:53,741
¶ YOU DON'T STOP TALKING

448
00:28:53,741 --> 00:28:59,462
AND I'M JUST
SLEEPWALKING ¶

449
00:28:59,883 --> 00:29:04,610
¶ I KNOW YOU'VE MADE ME
YOUR MADONNA

450
00:29:04,610 --> 00:29:08,726
I WANNA BE YOUR WHORE ¶

451
00:29:08,726 --> 00:29:12,316
¶ BABY IT WOULD BE MY HONOR

452
00:29:12,316 --> 00:29:16,543
PLEASE SIR
CAN I HAVE SOME MORE ¶

453
00:29:16,543 --> 00:29:20,712
¶ I COULD PRESERVE ALL
OF YOUR FANTASIES

454
00:29:20,712 --> 00:29:25,289
IF ONLY YOU COULD
ACT THEM ALL OUT WITH ME ¶

455
00:29:25,289 --> 00:29:29,887
¶ YOU DON'T STOP TALKING

456
00:29:29,887 --> 00:29:33,677
AND I'M JUST SLEEPWALKING ¶

457
00:29:33,677 --> 00:29:38,237
¶ SEE YOUR THOUGHTS FORMING

458
00:29:38,237 --> 00:29:42,066
BABY STOP IT
IT'S 3:00 IN THE MORNING ¶

459
00:29:42,066 --> 00:29:45,998
¶ AND I DON'T KNOW IF
YOU DO IT INTENTIONALLY

460
00:29:45,998 --> 00:29:50,435
BUT SOMEHOW YOU MAKE IT
MY FAULT ¶

461
00:29:50,435 --> 00:29:55,249
¶ YOU DON'T STOP TALKING

462
00:29:55,249 --> 00:30:01,234
AND I'M JUST
SLEEPWALKING-ING ¶

463
00:30:01,924 --> 00:30:05,424
¶ YOU WON'T LOVE ME

464
00:30:06,489 --> 00:30:09,947
YOU WON'T LEAVE ME ¶

465
00:30:45,747 --> 00:30:50,899
WEEKEND

466
00:30:58,346 --> 00:31:00,742
>> THANK YOU.
GOOD EVENING, EVERYONE.

467
00:31:00,742 --> 00:31:04,093
>> WELCOME TO "WEEKEND UPDATE,"
I'M MICHAEL CHE.
>> I'M COLIN JOST.

468
00:31:05,129 --> 00:31:09,900
>>> THIS WEEK, PRESIDENT TRUMP
LED A RALLY CELEBRATING HIS
HANDLING OF HIS ECONOMY,

469
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:13,095
WHICH
SOMEHOW HE HELD AT A CASINO IN
THE POCONOS.

470
00:31:13,095 --> 00:31:16,324
WEIRD TO SAY:
THE FUTURE IS BRIGHTER THAN EVER,

471
00:31:16,324 --> 00:31:20,551
ISN'T THAT RIGHT, WOMAN ON
OXYGEN PLAYING THE NICKEL SLOTS?

472
00:31:20,551 --> 00:31:24,161
TRUMP'S SPEECH WAS SUPPOSED TO
FOCUS ON THE AFFORDABILITY CRISIS,

473
00:31:24,161 --> 00:31:27,085
BUT HE DRIFTED OFF TOPIC
JUST A LITTLE BIT.

474
00:31:27,085 --> 00:31:31,054
>> THEY DON'T USE THE WORD CHIEF
OF STAFF ANYMORE BECAUSE OF THE
INDIANS.

475
00:31:31,054 --> 00:31:34,608
CAN YOU IMAGINE IF DONALD TRUMP
MARRIED HIS SISTER?

476
00:31:34,608 --> 00:31:36,633
DO WE LOVE MINERS?
I LOVE MINERS.

477
00:31:36,633 --> 00:31:38,742
WHAT?
DON'T FORGET WHO.

478
00:31:38,742 --> 00:31:40,960
EGGS!

479
00:31:42,598 --> 00:31:45,844
>> I LOVE THAT THE PRESIDENT
LOST HIS TRAIN OF THOUGHT

480
00:31:45,844 --> 00:31:50,171
AND
SOMEONE IN THE CROWD HAD TO
REMIND HIM HIS TRAIN OF THOUGHT
WAS EGGS.

481
00:31:50,171 --> 00:31:52,256
SORRY, EGGS!

482
00:31:52,256 --> 00:31:55,768
AS YOU CAN SEE FROM THE SIGN
BEHIND HIM, THE THEME OF THE RALLY WAS,

483
00:31:55,768 --> 00:31:58,236
LOWER PRICES, BIGGER
PAYCHECKS.

484
00:31:58,236 --> 00:32:00,940
WHICH WAS MUCH BETTER THAN HIS
ORIGINAL ECONOMIC MESSAGE,

485
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:04,205
NOT
MY FAULT, SELL YOUR BLOOD.

486
00:32:04,205 --> 00:32:07,433
>>> THIS WEEK, PRESIDENT TRUMP
CLAIMED THAT AFFORDABILITY

487
00:32:07,433 --> 00:32:10,394
IS A
NEW WORD MADE UP BY DEMOCRATS TO
HURT HIM.

488
00:32:10,394 --> 00:32:14,280
BUT IF DEMOCRATS REALLY WANTED
TO MAKE UP A WORD SPECIFICALLY TO HURT TRUMP,

489
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:17,212
IT WOULD PROBABLY
BE "FATMENTIA."

490
00:32:19,144 --> 00:32:23,274
PRESIDENT TRUMP ALSO COMPLAINED
ABOUT IMMIGRANTS FROM COUNTRIES LIKE HAITI

491
00:32:23,274 --> 00:32:26,902
AND ASKED, WHY CAN'T
WE HAVE SOME PEOPLE FROM NORWAY
INSTEAD?

492
00:32:26,902 --> 00:32:30,082
OR, HOW ABOUT SOMEONE WHO'S
NORWEGIAN AND HAITIAN?

493
00:32:30,082 --> 00:32:32,830
LIKE TIMES SQUARE ELSA?

494
00:32:35,157 --> 00:32:40,588
>>> THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND
SECURITY POSTED AN IMAGE OF
IMMIGRATION OFFICERS IN SANTA HATS

495
00:32:40,588 --> 00:32:43,558
WITH THE CAPTION, "YOU'RE
GOING HO HO HOME."

496
00:32:43,558 --> 00:32:47,467
EVEN WORSE, SANTA RETWEETED IT.

497
00:32:50,356 --> 00:32:54,895
>>> DHS SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM
TESTIFIED BEFORE CONGRESS

498
00:32:54,895 --> 00:32:58,019
WHERE
PROTESTERS INTERRUPTED HER BY
SHOUTING THE LINE

499
00:32:58,155 --> 00:33:02,573
"THE POWER OF
CHRIST COMPELS YOU."
FROM "THE EXORCIST."

500
00:33:02,573 --> 00:33:07,326
NOEM MOSTLY IGNORED THEM BUT DID
TAKE ONE QUICK LOOK BACK.

501
00:33:10,952 --> 00:33:14,781
>>> LAST WEEK, PRESIDENT TRUMP
HOSTED MULTIPLE EVENTS AT THE KENNEDY CENTER,

502
00:33:14,781 --> 00:33:18,108
INCLUDING AN
AWARDS CEREMONY FOR SYLVESTER
STALLONE,

503
00:33:18,108 --> 00:33:21,182
GLORIA GAYNOR, AND ROCK BAND KISS,

504
00:33:21,182 --> 00:33:24,410
AS WELL AS A
MUSICAL PERFORMANCE BY THE
VILLAGE PEOPLE.

505
00:33:24,410 --> 00:33:26,482
WHICH RAISES THE QUESTION,

506
00:33:26,482 --> 00:33:30,395
IS DONALD TRUMP A GAY MAN FROM
1978?

507
00:33:31,432 --> 00:33:33,694
>>> IN A NEW INTERVIEW,
PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID

508
00:33:33,694 --> 00:33:37,430
THAT
VENEZUELAN PRESIDENT NICOLAS
MADURO'S DAYS ARE NUMBERED.

509
00:33:37,430 --> 00:33:41,210
AS OPPOSED TO TRUMP, WHOSE DAYS
ARE LETTERED.

510
00:33:44,311 --> 00:33:49,226
>>> TRUMP ALSO SAYS A PROPOSED
MERGER BETWEEN NETFLIX AND
WARNER BROTHERS DISCOVERY

511
00:33:49,226 --> 00:33:53,029
COULD
BE A PROBLEM, ADDING, BRIBE!

512
00:33:54,225 --> 00:33:57,208
>>> IN RESPONSE, NETFLIX IS
OFFERING TRUMP

513
00:33:57,208 --> 00:34:00,465
ONE NIGHT WITH
THE DEMON HUNTERS.

514
00:34:01,622 --> 00:34:05,653
>>> THE ARCHDIOCESE OF NEW YORK
ANNOUNCED THAT IT WILL SET UP

515
00:34:05,653 --> 00:34:09,051
A
$300 MILLION FUND FOR VICTIMS OF
SEX ABUSE.

516
00:34:09,051 --> 00:34:11,467
THE CHURCH ENCOURAGES VICTIMS TO
CLAIM THE MONEY

517
00:34:11,467 --> 00:34:14,686
BY STICKING
THEIR HAND IN THIS HERE HOLE.

518
00:34:19,339 --> 00:34:21,441
>> OKAY, OKAY.

519
00:34:21,441 --> 00:34:26,162
>>> HEALTH OFFICIALS ARE
REPORTING A SURGE IN WINTER
VOMITING DISEASE.

520
00:34:26,162 --> 00:34:29,473
WHICH IS BETTER KNOWN AS
SANTA-CON.

521
00:34:32,183 --> 00:34:33,592
THIS CROWD.

522
00:34:33,592 --> 00:34:36,369
>>> THE HOLIDAYS ARE RIGHT
AROUND THE CORNER.

523
00:34:36,369 --> 00:34:38,642
MANY OF US WILL BE TRAVELING
HOME TO SEE OUR FAMILIES.

524
00:34:38,642 --> 00:34:41,787
HERE TO COMMENT IS OUR VERY OWN
MARCELLO HERNANDEZ.

525
00:34:41,787 --> 00:34:44,966
>> HELLO!
HELLO, EVERYONE.

526
00:34:44,966 --> 00:34:48,727
HOW ARE YOU, COLIN?
>> I'M GREAT, ARE YOU EXCITED
FOR CHRISTMAS, MARCELLO?

527
00:34:48,727 --> 00:34:52,157
>> YES, I LOVE CHRISTMAS.
I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE THE FAMILY.

528
00:34:52,157 --> 00:34:54,488
I CAN'T WAIT TO MEET THE NEW
BOYFRIENDS.

529
00:34:54,488 --> 00:34:57,628
CHRISTMAS IS THE TIME WHEN
SOMEONE BRINGS A NEW BOYFRIEND,

530
00:34:57,628 --> 00:35:01,166
AND HE SPENDS THE WHOLE NIGHT
PRETENDING TO BE SOMEONE HE'S
NOT.

531
00:35:01,166 --> 00:35:05,352
THE GUY'S LIKE, "I LOVE THE
FOOD, MRS. HERNANDEZ, IT'S
DELICIOUS."

532
00:35:05,352 --> 00:35:09,664
YOU DON'T LIKE THE FOOD, YOU
LIKE HAVING SEX WITH MY COUSIN!

533
00:35:13,558 --> 00:35:16,403
IN MY FAMILY, THERE'S ALWAYS AN
UNCLE

534
00:35:16,403 --> 00:35:19,675
WHO'S BIG ON GIVING
UNSOLICITED SEXUAL ADVICE.

535
00:35:19,675 --> 00:35:21,352
HE'S LIKE, "HEY, COME
HERE.

536
00:35:21,352 --> 00:35:25,225
NEXT TIME YOU GO TO THE NIPPLE,
BITE IT A LITTLE BIT."

537
00:35:25,225 --> 00:35:29,149
AND YOU'RE LIKE, "I'M 11, MAN."

538
00:35:35,339 --> 00:35:38,148
>> BITE IT A LITTLE.

539
00:35:38,148 --> 00:35:41,235
>> THAT WAS ME WHEN I WAS 11.

540
00:35:41,235 --> 00:35:44,838
>> WHAT KIND OF KID WERE YOU?

541
00:35:44,838 --> 00:35:46,676
>> THE BAD KIND, COLIN.

542
00:35:46,676 --> 00:35:50,299
I USED TO BE SO BAD THAT SANTA
CLAUS USED TO CALL ME.

543
00:35:50,299 --> 00:35:51,690
IN THE SUMMER.

544
00:35:51,690 --> 00:35:55,607
MY MOM HANDS ME THE PHONE AND
ST. NICHOLAS HIMSELF IS LIKE,

545
00:35:55,607 --> 00:35:59,260
"HEY, MARCELLO, HO HO HO, IT'S"
ME, SANTA CLAUS.

546
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:03,361
IF YOU DON'T BEHAVE, I'M GOING
TO SKIP YOUR HOUSE.

547
00:36:03,361 --> 00:36:05,818
I'D BE LIKE, "I'M SORRY, SANTA,
I'LL BEHAVE."

548
00:36:05,818 --> 00:36:07,128
AND HE'D BE LIKE --

549
00:36:09,876 --> 00:36:13,638
ME AND MY DOG RUDOLPH LOVE YOU
VERY MUCH.

550
00:36:13,638 --> 00:36:15,603
>> THAT'S ACTUALLY SWEET.

551
00:36:15,603 --> 00:36:19,749
>> YEAH, A LOT OF PEOPLE USED TO
CALL ME.
SPIDER-MAN USED TO CALL ME.

552
00:36:19,749 --> 00:36:21,580
>> SPIDER-MAN?
>> YES.

553
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:26,182
"HEY, MARCELLO, IT'S ME, YOUR"
NEIGHBORHOOD FRIEND, SPIDER-MAN.

554
00:36:26,182 --> 00:36:31,502
I'M CALLING YOU BECAUSE YOUR
MOTHER TELLING ME THAT YOU ARE
CLIMBING ON THE WALLS.

555
00:36:31,502 --> 00:36:34,519
YOU CANNOT DO THAT.
ONLY I CAN DO THAT.

556
00:36:34,519 --> 00:36:38,984
BECAUSE I WAS BEATEN BY A
RADIOACTIVE SPIDER.

557
00:36:38,984 --> 00:36:45,011
"ME AND MY BROTHER
SUPERMAN LOVE YOU VERY MUCH."

558
00:36:45,011 --> 00:36:47,634
>> I'M NOT SURE THAT WAS
ACTUALLY SUPERMAN.

559
00:36:47,634 --> 00:36:50,297
>> YOU KNOW, I ACTUALLY STILL
GET A LOT OF THESE CALLS.

560
00:36:50,297 --> 00:36:53,228
LISTEN TO THIS VOICEMAIL THAT
LORNE LEFT ME.

561
00:36:53,228 --> 00:36:56,792
>> HEY, MARCELLO, IT'S ME, YOUR
BOSS, LORNE MICHAEL.

562
00:37:00,187 --> 00:37:05,455
ME AND MY BROTHER, JIMMY FALLON,
LOVE YOU VERY MUCH.

563
00:37:05,731 --> 00:37:07,348
>> BROTHER?

564
00:37:07,348 --> 00:37:09,777
ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO BACK TO THE
HOLIDAYS.

565
00:37:09,777 --> 00:37:13,299
I'M ASSUMING YOU HAVE A BIG
LATIN CHRISTMAS?

566
00:37:14,631 --> 00:37:17,152
DON'T DO THAT, COLIN.

567
00:37:17,152 --> 00:37:19,230
BUT YES.
I DO.

568
00:37:19,230 --> 00:37:21,347
WE EAT PORK, WE DANCE,

569
00:37:21,347 --> 00:37:23,614
AND AT THE END OF THE NIGHT, MY CUBAN
MOM IS LIKE,

570
00:37:23,614 --> 00:37:26,532
"YOU KNOW WHAT I
WANT FOR CHRISTMAS?
A GRANDCHILD.

571
00:37:26,532 --> 00:37:29,762
BUT YOU WON'T GIVE IT TO ME
BECAUSE YOU HATE ME."

572
00:37:29,762 --> 00:37:33,869
>> OH, MY GOD.
ARE THERE ANY CHRISTMAS MOVIES
YOU WATCH?

573
00:37:33,869 --> 00:37:36,078
>> YES, WE USED TO WATCH "HOME
ALONE."

574
00:37:36,078 --> 00:37:39,421
AS A LATINO KID, THAT MOVIE WAS
UNBELIEVABLE.

575
00:37:39,421 --> 00:37:41,428
BECAUSE THIS KID MISSES THE
PLANE,

576
00:37:41,428 --> 00:37:44,062
DESTROYS THE HOUSE, AND
RUINS THE VACATION.

577
00:37:44,062 --> 00:37:49,101
AND SOMEHOW THIS MOVIE DOESN'T
END IN A HISTORIC ASS-BEATING.

578
00:37:49,672 --> 00:37:53,420
IN THE FIRST SCENE, THE MOM IS
LIKE, "GO TO YOUR ROOM, KEVIN."

579
00:37:53,420 --> 00:37:55,178
AND HE GOES, "SHUT UP, MOP."

580
00:37:55,178 --> 00:37:59,709
IF THAT WAS ME?
THAT'S WHERE THE MOVIE ENDS.

581
00:37:59,709 --> 00:38:01,818
ROLL THE CREDITS!

582
00:38:01,818 --> 00:38:05,014
"IN MEMORY OF MARCELLO"
HERNANDEZ."

583
00:38:05,014 --> 00:38:06,472
>> MARCELLO HERNANDEZ, EVERYONE!

584
00:38:06,472 --> 00:38:08,784
MARCELLO

585
00:38:14,906 --> 00:38:17,222
SPIDER-MAN, I LIKE THAT.

586
00:38:17,222 --> 00:38:21,621
>>> ACCORDING TO A NEW REPORT,
PEOPLE ON LONG ISLAND SPENT MORE
MONEY ON ONLYFANS

587
00:38:21,621 --> 00:38:24,791
THAN SOME
ENTIRE EASTERN EUROPEAN NATIONS.

588
00:38:24,791 --> 00:38:28,089
BECAUSE EASTERN EUROPEANS ARE
TOO BUSY WORKING --

589
00:38:28,089 --> 00:38:30,395

00:54:27,465 --> 00:54:28,330
YOUR MOM?

901
00:54:28,332 --> 00:54:28,998
>> NOPE.

902

903
00:54:31,502 --> 00:54:33,435
>> OH, OKAY.

904
00:54:33,437 --> 00:54:34,503
>> BUT I MIGHT END IT BECAUSE I

905

WANT TO BE SINGLE FOR MIAMI.

906
00:54:35,940 --> 00:54:37,706

907
00:54:37,708 --> 00:54:39,408
WHO'S HOOKING UP WITH WHO?

908
00:54:39,410 --> 00:54:41,310

912
00:54:43,848 --> 00:54:46,782
I KNOW HOW IT WORKS.

913
00:54:46,784 --> 00:54:49,451
ONE TIME THIS OLD UKRAINIAN LADY

914
00:54:49,453 --> 00:54:52,788

DON'T YOU ANTICIPATE MY NEEDS

925
00:55:09,507 --> 00:55:10,139

>> NO, YOU'RE MY PEER, HEATHER.

932
00:55:18,449 --> 00:55:18,981
>> WHY?

933

PRETTY, HEATHER.

941
