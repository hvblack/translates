1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:02,712
Why didn't you fix that stupid dish?

2
00:00:02,795 --> 00:00:05,506
I tried. The nuts are all stripped.
I can't get them off.

3
00:00:05,589 --> 00:00:08,551
You're using needle-nose pliers
instead of a crescent wrench?

4
00:00:08,634 --> 00:00:09,677
You're such a donkey.

5
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:19,562
These nuts aren't stripped, they're fine.
Are you a complete moron?

6
00:00:19,645 --> 00:00:21,981
Yes! I got you.

7
00:00:22,064 --> 00:00:23,190
What the hell are you doing?

8
00:00:23,274 --> 00:00:24,942
- Getting you.
- Why?

9
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:26,569
Revenge, baby.

10
00:00:26,652 --> 00:00:28,028
Revenge for what?

11
00:00:30,281 --> 00:00:31,657
{\an8}Yes! I got you.

12
00:00:31,741 --> 00:00:33,701
- What are you doing?
- Getting you.

13
00:00:33,784 --> 00:00:35,202
- Why?
- I don't know.

14
00:00:35,286 --> 00:00:36,454
Your face. It's the worst.

15
00:00:36,537 --> 00:00:38,289
Anyway, have fun on the roof
all day, idiot.

16
00:00:39,999 --> 00:00:44,920
Jay, I was on that roof for 12 hours
for no reason.

17
00:00:45,004 --> 00:00:48,591
No, I told you the reason.
It was your face and how it's the worst.

18
00:00:48,674 --> 00:00:52,970
That very day, around hour four,
I started plotting my revenge.

19
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:56,891
In 2015, I convinced Drea
to get a satellite TV

20
00:00:56,974 --> 00:00:58,601
by offering to pay for it.

21
00:00:58,684 --> 00:01:01,896
I could barely afford $80 a month,
but it was worth it.

22
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:06,484
Then I checked the weather,
and I found the perfect, boiling hot day.

23
00:01:06,567 --> 00:01:08,736
We live in San Antonio. Every day is hot.

24
00:01:08,819 --> 00:01:10,321
Shut up! I am talking now!

25
00:01:12,406 --> 00:01:15,743
Then I did research for weeks
on bolts and wrenches,

26
00:01:15,826 --> 00:01:18,454
and then all the stuff
that you know about.

27
00:01:18,537 --> 00:01:23,417
And then today,
after ten years, I pounced.

28
00:01:23,501 --> 00:01:25,377
That was one of the worst days of my life.

29
00:01:25,461 --> 00:01:27,296
And you have never apologized.

30
00:01:27,379 --> 00:01:29,715
So, all you have to do...

31
00:01:30,841 --> 00:01:33,761
say that you're sorry
and I will let you down.

32
00:01:33,844 --> 00:01:35,721
But I know you're never gonna do that.

33
00:01:35,805 --> 00:01:36,680
Never.

34
00:01:36,764 --> 00:01:38,140
So, suck roof.

35
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,561
Aww, man,
you guys getting rid of the satellite?

36
00:01:42,645 --> 00:01:44,814
How are you gonna watch
Guatemala Has Talent?

37
00:01:44,897 --> 00:01:45,815
Hey.

38
00:01:45,898 --> 00:01:49,151
Primo's little friend that isn't Miguel,
give me a hand with that ladder.

39
00:01:49,235 --> 00:01:51,904
No. Do not get involved in revenge.

40
00:01:51,987 --> 00:01:54,281
- Don't even look at him.
-  Primo! Primo!

41
00:01:54,365 --> 00:01:56,992
I'm your uncle!
Don't leave me on this roof.

42
00:01:58,869 --> 00:02:01,288
Oh. It's already hot.

43
00:02:02,414 --> 00:02:04,500
I gotta hand it to him.
He did his research.

44
00:02:13,175 --> 00:02:14,385
Hey, everybody!

45
00:02:14,468 --> 00:02:16,679
You see your uncle outside?
Is he sucking roof?

46
00:02:16,762 --> 00:02:20,808
Uh, I have no idea what that means.
But look, I won an award!

47
00:02:20,891 --> 00:02:25,646
The Whataburger What A Student Award.
Oh, my God! That's incredible!

48
00:02:25,729 --> 00:02:27,648
It's 250 bucks.

49
00:02:27,731 --> 00:02:30,776
And this certificate
with all these fancy scripts on it.

50
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:32,611
Rafa, that's fantastic.

51
00:02:32,695 --> 00:02:34,947
Only two students
in the whole school got these.

52
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:36,949
- Are you the other one who got it?
- No.

53
00:02:37,032 --> 00:02:38,367
Then why are you so excited?

54
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:39,618
Because I'm Rafa's friend.

55
00:02:40,452 --> 00:02:41,829
I don't know. I think it's weird.

56
00:02:42,496 --> 00:02:44,081
Gimme, gimme.

57
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:45,040
Wow.

58
00:02:45,124 --> 00:02:48,794
This deserves a place on
the Wall of Accomplishments and Praise.

59
00:02:49,503 --> 00:02:52,089
The Wall of Accomplishments and Praise.

60
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:53,883
- The WAP.
- Ma, please.

61
00:02:53,966 --> 00:02:55,885
You have to say
the whole name now, remember?

62
00:02:55,968 --> 00:02:57,720
You can't just shorten it anymore.

63
00:02:57,803 --> 00:02:59,930
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
you're taking down my degree?

64
00:03:00,014 --> 00:03:03,225
Degree? I thought Rafa was gonna be
the first one to go to college.

65
00:03:03,309 --> 00:03:07,021
Oh, he is. That's a certificate from
the San Antonio Technological Institute.

66
00:03:07,104 --> 00:03:09,148
Yeah, I have a degree in Computer Science.

67
00:03:09,231 --> 00:03:11,025
You have a certificate in computers.

68
00:03:11,108 --> 00:03:12,610
Your final exam was printing that out.

69
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:14,945
Drea, you can't move that.

70
00:03:15,029 --> 00:03:17,364
That is a significant
family accomplishment.

71
00:03:17,448 --> 00:03:19,700
You can just hang it up at your place,

72
00:03:19,783 --> 00:03:23,454
right next to your autographed picture
of that sexy blood lady.

73
00:03:23,537 --> 00:03:24,705
Her name is Elizabeth Holmes.

74
00:03:24,788 --> 00:03:27,499
And when she gets out of prison,
she's gonna change the world.

75
00:03:27,583 --> 00:03:28,709
Uh-huh.

76
00:03:28,792 --> 00:03:31,503
Maybe we can just leave
Uncle Ryan's thing up?

77
00:03:31,587 --> 00:03:32,671
See?

78
00:03:32,755 --> 00:03:35,257
Even Primo doesn't care
about a stupid little award.

79
00:03:35,341 --> 00:03:38,594
It's ridiculous these days.
Everybody gets a participation trophy.

80
00:03:38,677 --> 00:03:39,762
I mean, yours literally says,

81
00:03:39,845 --> 00:03:42,473
"Ryan Gonzales participated
in a ten-week computer course."

82
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:45,768
And it's not stupid.
I worked hard to earn it.

83
00:03:45,851 --> 00:03:48,646
You know what?
I don't like to throw this term around,

84
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:50,689
- but this is cancel culture.
- Okay.

85
00:03:50,773 --> 00:03:53,192
I feel like you do like
to throw that term around.

86
00:03:53,275 --> 00:03:58,238
Ugh. Not enough bubbles.
Cancel culture.

87
00:03:58,322 --> 00:03:59,573
You're breaking up with me

88
00:03:59,657 --> 00:04:02,451
just because I took a platonic nap
with your sister?

89
00:04:02,534 --> 00:04:04,411
That's cancel culture.

90
00:04:04,495 --> 00:04:09,291
Cell service canceled for non-payment?
You know what this is?

91
00:04:09,375 --> 00:04:11,710
Why do you keep calling everything
cancel culture?

92
00:04:11,794 --> 00:04:12,878
I don't know.

93
00:04:12,962 --> 00:04:16,465
I hear it used a lot, and I don't want
Succession  or  Euphoria

94
00:04:16,548 --> 00:04:18,008
and I don't know who Doja Cat is.

95
00:04:18,092 --> 00:04:20,094
I just wanna be a part of something.

96
00:04:20,177 --> 00:04:22,888
Hey, don't worry, bro.
You are a part of something.

97
00:04:22,972 --> 00:04:25,307
You're part of the people
not on the wall anymore.

98
00:04:26,183 --> 00:04:28,560
Do you think you're being helpful
right now?

99
00:04:28,644 --> 00:04:29,979
Let me down, stupid.

100
00:04:30,062 --> 00:04:31,689
- No.
- Mike, let me down.

101
00:04:31,772 --> 00:04:32,773
- No.
- I wanna get down.

102
00:04:32,856 --> 00:04:34,024
- No.
- Let me down.

103
00:04:34,108 --> 00:04:36,276
- No.
- Mike, let me down.

104
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,070
- No.
- Mike, I'm serious.

105
00:04:38,153 --> 00:04:39,780
- Go get the ladder.
- No.

106
00:04:39,863 --> 00:04:41,031
Please let me down?

107
00:04:41,782 --> 00:04:42,700
No.

108
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:48,288
Drea, come on.
I earned my spot on that wall.

109
00:04:48,372 --> 00:04:50,958
I earned my award.
I had to write a ten-page paper.

110
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:52,710
You just had to learn
how to send some emails.

111
00:04:52,793 --> 00:04:54,253
- Nice, Primo.
- Tough.

112
00:04:54,336 --> 00:04:56,505
Okay, listen, it's my house.

113
00:04:56,588 --> 00:04:58,716
- It's my WAP.
- Oh, my God, Ma, please.

114
00:04:58,799 --> 00:05:00,342
And I decide what goes on it.

115
00:05:00,426 --> 00:05:03,012
No. That's not good enough.

116
00:05:03,095 --> 00:05:05,305
There's only one fair way to solve this.

117
00:05:07,975 --> 00:05:10,936
Game Champ.
Winner decides what goes on the wall.

118
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:12,980
What's Game Champ?

119
00:05:13,063 --> 00:05:15,399
It's a Gonzales family Frankenstein.

120
00:05:15,482 --> 00:05:19,403
It's the greatest game ever invented
because it contains all the other games.

121
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:21,405
Name a game, it's part of Game Champ.

122
00:05:21,488 --> 00:05:22,656
- Monopoly?
- Yeah.

123
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:24,575
- Cranium?
- Hell yeah.

124
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:25,909
Hungry, Hungry Hippos?

125
00:05:25,993 --> 00:05:27,327
Stop naming games.

126
00:05:27,411 --> 00:05:29,580
- I said it's every game.
-  It's everything.

127
00:05:29,663 --> 00:05:32,458
There's Trivial Pursuit,
Chutes and Ladders,

128
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:35,878
restaurant menus,
untranslated IKEA instructions.

129
00:05:35,961 --> 00:05:38,672
It combines strategy,
hand-eye coordination,

130
00:05:38,756 --> 00:05:41,759
thigh strength, pain tolerance,
and mental prowess.

131
00:05:41,842 --> 00:05:46,555
And we are not playing.
I can't lie to the police again.

132
00:05:46,638 --> 00:05:48,849
Blood-curdling screams?

133
00:05:48,932 --> 00:05:51,769
No, we... I haven't heard anything like...

134
00:05:51,852 --> 00:05:54,396
Ah!

135
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:57,816
Whoo! I am the Game Champ!

136
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:00,486
Bow down to the Game Champ!

137
00:06:00,569 --> 00:06:02,446
Whoo!

138
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:06,116
Look, Game Champ is messy.
But so is the quest for justice.

139
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,326
Seriously?

140
00:06:07,409 --> 00:06:10,662
Whatever. Just let us play!
You know you wanna play.

141
00:06:10,746 --> 00:06:12,414
- I kind of do.
- What?

142
00:06:12,498 --> 00:06:15,042
It's Game Champ. I like Game Champ.
Who doesn't like Game Champ?

143
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:18,003
Yeah. I am fully prepared
to leave him up there for weeks.

144
00:06:18,087 --> 00:06:19,630
Are we playing Game Champ?

145
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:21,799
Oh, I'm in. I call pocket knife.
I'm the pocket knife.

146
00:06:21,882 --> 00:06:23,425
All the knives are gone. Remember?

147
00:06:23,509 --> 00:06:27,763
Because of how Jay almost lost, like,
several of his toes last time.

148
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:31,767
You in, Primo? Or are you chicken fingers?

149
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:33,560
Buk, buk, buk, buk, buk, buk!

150
00:06:33,644 --> 00:06:35,395
- That's a good chicken.
- Thank you.

151
00:06:35,479 --> 00:06:37,856
Fine. I'm in.

152
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:40,400
- Let's get started.
- I wanna play. Can I play too?

153
00:06:40,484 --> 00:06:43,821
If you're gonna play with us,
you got to learn the official rules.

154
00:06:43,904 --> 00:06:46,281
"Each turn begins with a roll of 12 dice.

155
00:06:46,365 --> 00:06:49,743
The top roll gets to either play a turn
or flick another player's nose.

156
00:06:49,827 --> 00:06:52,955
If they choose nose flick,
it activates 'flick-o-mode.'

157
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:55,749
{\an8}And whoever gets the most flicks
in one minute begins the turn."

158
00:06:55,833 --> 00:06:56,917
This is insane.

159
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,627
Oh, yeah. This game is nuts.

160
00:06:58,710 --> 00:06:59,795
There's only a few hours
until dinner,

161
00:06:59,878 --> 00:07:01,463
so we got to play the short version.

162
00:07:01,547 --> 00:07:04,133
No binge drinking,
no foot races, no moped stunts,

163
00:07:04,216 --> 00:07:06,969
no shoe-swapping,
and no stick-and-poke tattooing.

164
00:07:07,052 --> 00:07:08,637
- Sorry, babe.
-  Oh, wait.

165
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,098
{\an8}Harris hasn't played before.
We need to initiate him.

166
00:07:11,181 --> 00:07:12,099
{\an8} Ah!

167
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:16,311
I thought you said knives were gone.

168
00:07:16,395 --> 00:07:17,771
There's always a knife.

169
00:07:17,855 --> 00:07:20,524
Hey, should I sterilize this?
Or are you cool?

170
00:07:21,191 --> 00:07:23,360
- Yeah, I'm out. I'm gonna leave.
- It's for the best.

171
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:25,237
Okay, we're missing
the jar of rancid peanuts

172
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,446
and the throwing stars.

173
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:27,906
I'm on it.

174
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:40,836
Rollie, hurry up. We're starting.

175
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:42,045
The sword.

176
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:48,760
- Oh!
- All right, Mondo,

177
00:07:48,844 --> 00:07:50,804
- you get to spend the pregnancy test.
- Yes!

178
00:07:50,888 --> 00:07:52,723
Hey, I need your help.

179
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:54,600
- A ghost owes me $40.
- Oh, okay.

180
00:07:54,683 --> 00:07:56,560
As soon as we're done here, I'll help you.

181
00:07:56,643 --> 00:07:59,271
No, this can't wait.
This is urgent ghost business.

182
00:07:59,354 --> 00:08:03,358
Okay, so whoever this lands on
has to eat whatever's in my pocket.

183
00:08:03,442 --> 00:08:05,569
- Okay.
- Oh!

184
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:07,613
Oh, no.

185
00:08:07,696 --> 00:08:09,323
You have no shirt, you're out.

186
00:08:09,406 --> 00:08:10,574
Uncle Rollie's right.

187
00:08:10,657 --> 00:08:13,702
We instituted that rule after
the  Magic Mike  Challenge of 2018.

188
00:08:13,785 --> 00:08:14,745
Yup.

189
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:17,497
I had to throw away the whole couch.
Too many body oil stains.

190
00:08:17,581 --> 00:08:19,333
It looked like a giant piece of flan.

191
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:24,421
Well, I guess I'm out too. Bummer.
Hey, Mondo, come on, let's go.

192
00:08:27,966 --> 00:08:30,636
When I get off this roof,
I'm gonna hit him with a pipe.

193
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:33,096
No, I'm gonna hit him with a car.

194
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:34,556
No, I'm gonna hit him...

195
00:08:36,642 --> 00:08:39,853
Sudden Death: This or That. Speed round.

196
00:08:39,937 --> 00:08:41,813
- One of you is dead.
- What's the category?

197
00:08:41,897 --> 00:08:44,691
Actor or disease.
You have one second to answer.

198
00:08:44,775 --> 00:08:45,943
The first wrong answer loses.

199
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:48,987
Mike, Primo, Drea.
That's the order. Are you ready?

200
00:08:49,071 --> 00:08:50,113
- Got it.
- Here we go.

201
00:08:50,197 --> 00:08:51,365
- Cumberbatch.
- Actor.

202
00:08:51,448 --> 00:08:52,532
- Zika.
- Disease.

203
00:08:52,616 --> 00:08:53,742
- Waititi.
- Actor.

204
00:08:53,825 --> 00:08:54,743
- Fishburne.
- Actor.

205
00:08:54,826 --> 00:08:55,994
- Ventimiglia.
- Actor.

206
00:08:56,078 --> 00:08:56,912
- Ebola.
- Disease.

207
00:08:56,995 --> 00:08:58,080
- Vitiligo.
- Actor.

208
00:08:58,163 --> 00:09:00,499
Wrong. Vitiligo is a disease, dummy.

209
00:09:00,582 --> 00:09:02,876
Vitiligo is the guy
from  Lord of the Rings,  dummy.

210
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:05,921
No, that's Viggo Mortensen,
not Vitiligo Mortensen.

211
00:09:06,004 --> 00:09:08,131
- You're out!
- Bye.

212
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:11,093
You know what?
Everyone at this table can go to hell.

213
00:09:12,427 --> 00:09:15,138
Well, well, well. And then there were two.

214
00:09:15,222 --> 00:09:17,724
- I'm still in.
- Whatever. The two that matter.

215
00:09:25,315 --> 00:09:27,025
Who are you trying to contact
in the spirit world?

216
00:09:27,109 --> 00:09:28,151
Felipe.

217
00:09:28,235 --> 00:09:30,153
Rodeo Clown Felipe or Heart Attack Felipe?

218
00:09:30,237 --> 00:09:33,907
Heart Attack Felipe.
Rodeo Clown Felipe survived the goring.

219
00:09:33,991 --> 00:09:37,703
Oh, that's good.
That was a big hole. Right in his chest.

220
00:09:37,786 --> 00:09:39,538
-  It's water balloon bingo!
-  Yeah.

221
00:09:39,621 --> 00:09:41,498
Water balloon bingo is my favorite.

222
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:43,375
- Come on, let's go.

223
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:45,544
Okay.

224
00:09:45,627 --> 00:09:48,380
Let's see if the spirit world
wants to communicate with us.

225
00:09:48,463 --> 00:09:50,674
W-H-Y. Why?

226
00:09:50,757 --> 00:09:54,970
Maybe Heart Attack Felipe wants to know
why you made me stop playing Game Champ

227
00:09:55,053 --> 00:09:57,014
or why you ruined my favorite shirt.

228
00:09:57,097 --> 00:09:58,557
No. I know what this is.

229
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,642
Hey, you took that bet
fair and square, Felipe.

230
00:10:00,726 --> 00:10:02,644
Nobody forced you to jump that ditch.

231
00:10:02,728 --> 00:10:04,938
- Jump that ditch! Jump that ditch!
- Are you ready, old man?

232
00:10:05,022 --> 00:10:06,815
Jump that ditch!

233
00:10:06,898 --> 00:10:10,777
My arm is numb, my chest is tight,
and my mouth tastes like metal.

234
00:10:10,861 --> 00:10:12,321
Let's do this!

235
00:10:16,241 --> 00:10:20,329
{\an8} Jump that ditch!
Jump that ditch! Jump that ditch!

236
00:10:22,331 --> 00:10:26,335
He died doing what he loved.
Losing control of a vehicle.

237
00:10:32,674 --> 00:10:33,759
Forty-six.

238
00:10:36,845 --> 00:10:39,431
Monologue Jungle.
Recite a monologue from a movie.

239
00:10:39,514 --> 00:10:42,184
One wrong word and you're out.

240
00:10:42,267 --> 00:10:43,769
- Okay.
- Okay. Here we go.

241
00:10:45,228 --> 00:10:48,857
"Tony Montana,  Scarface.
Political prisoner monologue."

242
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:50,025
Easy.

243
00:10:50,108 --> 00:10:52,486
- All right, here you go. Keep track.

244
00:10:52,569 --> 00:10:55,280
As always, I will be substituting
desert foods for all the cuss words.

245
00:10:55,364 --> 00:10:56,531
- Okay.

246
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:02,746
Do you know
I eat octopus three times a day?

247
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:06,124
I got fudging octopus
coming out of my fudging ears, man.

248
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:09,544
I got the fudging Russian shoes,
my feet's comin' through. Huh?

249
00:11:09,628 --> 00:11:10,962
How'd you like that?

250
00:11:11,046 --> 00:11:12,756
What, you want me to stay there
and do nothing?

251
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:15,717
Hey, I'm no fudging criminal, man.

252
00:11:15,801 --> 00:11:17,636
I'm no pudding nor thief.

253
00:11:17,719 --> 00:11:21,390
I Tony Montana,
a political prisoner from Cuba.

254
00:11:21,473 --> 00:11:23,850
And I want my fudgin' human rights!

255
00:11:23,934 --> 00:11:25,477
Wow.

256
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,938
That was great! Amazing!

257
00:11:28,021 --> 00:11:29,147
Thank you.

258
00:11:29,231 --> 00:11:30,690
Unfortunately, you're out.

259
00:11:30,774 --> 00:11:33,527
What? No way. I nailed it.

260
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:35,695
Ooh, but you didn't.

261
00:11:35,779 --> 00:11:38,698
It's, "And I want
my fudgin' human rights now,"

262
00:11:38,782 --> 00:11:40,909
not, "And I want my fudgin' human rights."

263
00:11:40,992 --> 00:11:42,911
- You forgot the "now."
-  He's right.

264
00:11:42,994 --> 00:11:46,081
It has to be word-perfect.
That's the rule.

265
00:11:46,873 --> 00:11:47,916
Out.

266
00:11:50,669 --> 00:11:51,670
That's cool.

267
00:11:57,008 --> 00:11:58,009
Ugh!

268
00:11:59,177 --> 00:12:00,387
It's down to you and me.

269
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:01,847
Bullshit!

270
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:04,474
Headband is up for grabs.

271
00:12:04,558 --> 00:12:06,309
Take up my chair!

272
00:12:06,393 --> 00:12:09,688
I'm getting another message. Yes.

273
00:12:10,856 --> 00:12:12,023
S-I-N-G.

274
00:12:12,607 --> 00:12:15,152
He wants you to sing a song in his honor.

275
00:12:15,235 --> 00:12:16,736
What song?

276
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:19,489
I think, hmm, yes,
he wants you to make one up.

277
00:12:19,573 --> 00:12:23,201
He wants you to invent a song
in tribute to his life.

278
00:12:24,369 --> 00:12:26,580
He says, make it good,

279
00:12:26,663 --> 00:12:29,458
or he's going to haunt the ... out of you.

280
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:31,084
Yeah, that does sound like him.

I'm getting kind of hungry up here.

292
00:13:05,869 --> 00:13:08,914
Oh, I'm sorry, bud. I got you a sandwich.

293

Sock sandwich?

I'm not gonna eat this.

295
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:25,597
You didn't give me any food
when I was trapped up there, so...

296
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,557
Let it go. We were kids.

00:13:27,641 --> 00:13:29,351
You were 30. Bon appetit.

It seems your awful singing
has angered Heart Attack Felipe.

300
00:13:36,483 --> 00:13:38,026
And he's in the room.

301
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:40,570
Heart Attack Felipe's here?

302
00:13:40,654 --> 00:13:43,448
Yes, as his younger self.

303
00:13:43,532 --> 00:13:46,868
He's ripped, man. And he's after you.

304
00:13:47,536 --> 00:13:52,541
He says he doesn't owe you a crap.
In fact, he says you owe him the 40 bucks.

305
00:13:52,624 --> 00:13:56,795
Nah, no way.
Hey, look, man. We made a bet. You lost.

306
00:13:56,878 --> 00:14:01,007
You had a heart attack, you died.
So you owe me 40 bucks. Hey, fair's fair.

307
00:14:01,091 --> 00:14:02,842
That's not how he sees it.

308
00:14:03,677 --> 00:14:05,428
He says you should give me the money.

309
00:14:05,512 --> 00:14:07,222
- Give it to you?
- Yes.

310
00:14:07,305 --> 00:14:10,308
I am a bridge between realms.

311
00:14:10,392 --> 00:14:13,353
So, if you give the money to me,
I can make sure he gets it.

312
00:14:13,979 --> 00:14:15,897
I only charge $10 for the service.

313
00:14:15,981 --> 00:14:17,649
So 50 total.

314
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:21,736
He wants you to give me the $50.

315
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:24,698
Fine.

316
00:14:25,949 --> 00:14:27,242
- Fine?
- Yeah.

317
00:14:27,325 --> 00:14:29,202
I mean, this is what I was worried about.

318
00:14:30,537 --> 00:14:34,082
Some people say that since the front tires
touched the other wall of the ditch,

319
00:14:34,165 --> 00:14:37,335
that technically, he made it across.
So, I lost the bet.

320
00:14:37,961 --> 00:14:42,382
But to me, the bet was whether Felipe
would make the jump, not the car.

321
00:14:42,465 --> 00:14:45,260
He clearly didn't,
because he was dead in the ditch.

322
00:14:45,844 --> 00:14:48,179
But I don't even care about any of that.

323
00:14:49,139 --> 00:14:52,642
I just miss my friend
and I don't want him to be mad at me.

324
00:14:57,397 --> 00:14:59,065
Can you ask him if he's mad at me?

325
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:03,403
Rollie.

326
00:15:07,616 --> 00:15:09,784
Come on. I know what to do.

327
00:15:15,957 --> 00:15:18,251
Yeah! Give me that money.

328
00:15:19,711 --> 00:15:20,712
Tea Pot Dome Scandal.

329
00:15:20,795 --> 00:15:21,796
The Magna Carta.

330
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:23,715
- Adele Dazeem.
- Thin Mints.

331
00:15:24,966 --> 00:15:26,635
Yes!

332
00:15:26,718 --> 00:15:28,178
You like that?

333
00:15:31,306 --> 00:15:33,266
Jeffrey Dahmer and Winston Churchill.

334
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:36,811
Oh, no. Is it the human femur?

335
00:15:36,895 --> 00:15:38,980
Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit.

336
00:15:39,064 --> 00:15:42,192
J-A-M-I-R-O-Q-U-A-I, Jamiroquai.

337
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:43,985
Five seconds left.

338
00:15:44,069 --> 00:15:46,029
- You need every word.
- Almost done.

339
00:15:46,112 --> 00:15:48,281
- Here we go.

340
00:15:48,365 --> 00:15:50,408
- What is that?
- I found every word.

341
00:15:50,492 --> 00:15:52,452
That doesn't count.
You just circled everything.

342
00:15:52,535 --> 00:15:55,288
Yes, and within that circle
lies every single word.

343
00:15:55,372 --> 00:15:56,956
I win.

344
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,918
No, you don't. That clearly doesn't count.
It's my turn.

345
00:16:00,001 --> 00:16:02,921
And all I need to do
is roll higher than four,

346
00:16:03,004 --> 00:16:05,298
which I did, because there are 12 dice.

347
00:16:05,382 --> 00:16:07,717
And that is ga...

348
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:10,095
Dude.

349
00:16:11,554 --> 00:16:15,141
If you swallow your opponent's game piece,
you win Game Champ.

350
00:16:15,225 --> 00:16:17,519
- That's not a rule.
- It is now.

351
00:16:17,602 --> 00:16:19,604
Explain how eating a piece of metal
makes you the smartest.

352
00:16:19,688 --> 00:16:23,191
How does winning an award
from a burger place make you the smartest?

353
00:16:23,274 --> 00:16:27,487
It doesn't. I win. Game over. Game Champ.

354
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:28,905
Ryan, may I speak with you in the kitchen?

355
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:30,115
Oh, no. I just ate. Thank you.

356
00:16:30,198 --> 00:16:31,616
- Get in here.
- Mm-hmm.

357
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:42,210
Hey, Primo, do me a favor.
Take these out to your Uncle Jay.

358
00:16:42,293 --> 00:16:45,839
- Oh, no, I am not getting involved.
- Please?

359
00:16:45,922 --> 00:16:48,216
He's been up there a really long time.
I'm starting to feel bad.

360
00:16:48,299 --> 00:16:50,093
I'm just not ready to admit that.

361
00:16:51,136 --> 00:16:52,178
Okay.

362
00:16:55,515 --> 00:16:58,435
Let's play a new game.
It's called Drea's Lie Detector.

363
00:16:58,518 --> 00:17:01,020
The way it works is
I'm gonna ask you questions.

364
00:17:01,104 --> 00:17:03,064
And if you lie to me, I smack you.

365
00:17:03,148 --> 00:17:04,315
I do not wanna play this.

366
00:17:04,399 --> 00:17:06,651
Are you so insecure
that you think winning this game

367
00:17:06,735 --> 00:17:09,446
will prove that you're better
than your 16-year-old nephew?

368
00:17:09,529 --> 00:17:12,031
No. We're just playing a fun game.

369
00:17:12,824 --> 00:17:15,869
Fine. Yes.
I wanna prove I'm better than Primo.

370
00:17:15,952 --> 00:17:20,415
And you realize how silly it is
that a grown man is jealous of a child?

371
00:17:20,498 --> 00:17:22,208
It's not silly.

372
00:17:22,292 --> 00:17:26,337
It's very silly. Yes, I see that.

373
00:17:26,421 --> 00:17:29,174
And you realize
that this is your nephew, who you love,

374
00:17:29,257 --> 00:17:31,718
and him winning an award
should make you proud of him?

375
00:17:32,719 --> 00:17:35,388
Well... Uh, now, hold on.

376
00:17:35,472 --> 00:17:38,892
Okay, if you look at it
in a certain way... No, you're right.

377
00:17:38,975 --> 00:17:41,019
I love him and I will apologize.

378
00:17:41,102 --> 00:17:42,687
Thank you.

379
00:17:42,771 --> 00:17:44,814
But this really is cancel culture.

380
00:17:46,316 --> 00:17:47,734
Go ahead.

381
00:17:47,817 --> 00:17:49,736
What's "cancel culture"?

382
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:54,616
Hey, Uncle Mike asked me
to give these to you.

383
00:17:54,699 --> 00:17:57,118
I think he's starting to feel bad.

384
00:17:57,202 --> 00:17:58,328
Oh, thank God.

385
00:18:04,167 --> 00:18:07,295
This is vinegar. Primo, you got involved.

386
00:18:07,378 --> 00:18:10,131
No, I didn't. I swear.
Uncle Mike tricked me.

387
00:18:10,215 --> 00:18:13,301
And I just got distracted,
all the stuff with Uncle Ryan.

388
00:18:13,384 --> 00:18:16,888
He's coming at me so hard,
it's making me wanna fight him.

389
00:18:19,015 --> 00:18:21,142
Listen to me very carefully, Primo.

390
00:18:23,353 --> 00:18:24,813
Follow that instinct.

391
00:18:24,896 --> 00:18:25,939
Really?

392
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:29,359
You can't ever back down. Look at me.

393
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:30,944
I've been on this roof for hours.

394
00:18:31,027 --> 00:18:32,987
I'm sunburned, I'm starving,

395
00:18:33,071 --> 00:18:35,532
and I'm two minutes from pooping
in whatever pipe that is.

396
00:18:35,615 --> 00:18:36,866
Please don't poop down a pipe.

397
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:39,786
The point is,
you can't let people push you around.

398
00:18:39,869 --> 00:18:42,497
I'd rather stay up here for a month
than let Mike win.

399
00:18:51,256 --> 00:18:52,924
I forgot it was vinegar.

400
00:18:54,676 --> 00:18:56,678
Hey, Primo. We need to talk.

401
00:18:56,761 --> 00:18:57,971
Yeah, we do.

402
00:18:58,054 --> 00:19:00,348
I earned that spot on that wall
and I'm taking it.

403
00:19:00,431 --> 00:19:01,808
Whoa. What's going on?

404
00:19:01,891 --> 00:19:04,352
I won fair and square. I'm the Game Champ.

405
00:19:04,435 --> 00:19:06,479
I'm one of only two
Whataburger What A Students

406
00:19:06,563 --> 00:19:08,773
in the entire South San Antonio Region.

407
00:19:08,857 --> 00:19:11,734
My certificate
deserves to be on that wall.

408
00:19:12,819 --> 00:19:15,655
Well, you've given me
a lot to think about.

409
00:19:23,371 --> 00:19:24,497
Where are you going?

410
00:19:35,508 --> 00:19:38,261
Why did your Uncle Ryan
just run out of our house with your award?

411
00:19:38,344 --> 00:19:40,889
Because he's a weirdo.
He's probably gonna try to eat it.

412
00:19:40,972 --> 00:19:42,098
I played a game with Ryan

413
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:44,726
where every time he said something dumb,
I slapped him.

414
00:19:44,809 --> 00:19:47,604
I'm not gonna do that with you
because you're a child.

415
00:19:47,687 --> 00:19:49,522
But also because
you should be smart enough

416
00:19:49,606 --> 00:19:50,940
to understand what you did wrong.

417
00:19:51,024 --> 00:19:52,775
How is this my fault?

418
00:19:53,776 --> 00:19:58,781
Rafa, look, Ryan feels threatened.

419
00:19:58,865 --> 00:20:01,784
He's always thought of himself
as the smart one in the family.

420
00:20:01,868 --> 00:20:03,870
And then you come along.

421
00:20:03,953 --> 00:20:06,581
And you're, you know,
might be going to college

422
00:20:06,664 --> 00:20:09,292
and you're winning burger awards.

423
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:11,836
Now he is acting like a buffoon.

424
00:20:13,087 --> 00:20:15,924
But maybe you can try and understand
what he's feeling.

425
00:20:16,633 --> 00:20:18,843
But what am I supposed to do about it?

426
00:20:18,927 --> 00:20:20,970
You're a Whataburger What A Student.

427
00:20:21,054 --> 00:20:24,182
You ought to be able
to what-a-figure it out.

428
00:20:25,308 --> 00:20:27,852
Nope. That was bad.

429
00:20:27,936 --> 00:20:31,022
But all the other stuff I said
was good and wise.

430
00:20:32,357 --> 00:20:33,358
Okay.

431
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,109
Okay.

432
00:20:36,361 --> 00:20:37,946
Are you sure about this?

433
00:20:38,029 --> 00:20:39,197
Yeah.

434
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,699
This is where Felipe crossed over.

435
00:20:41,783 --> 00:20:43,660
Literally and figuratively.

436
00:20:44,661 --> 00:20:46,037
He'll hear you.

437
00:20:51,501 --> 00:20:52,669
What's up, Felipe?

438
00:20:54,462 --> 00:20:57,548
Man, this is crazy.

439
00:20:57,632 --> 00:20:58,800
You're really gone.

440
00:21:00,176 --> 00:21:01,844
I thought you were gonna live forever.

441
00:21:03,096 --> 00:21:04,514
I mean, lifetime record
against heart attacks?

442
00:21:04,597 --> 00:21:05,807
You were ten and one.

443
00:21:06,641 --> 00:21:07,892
That's pretty good.

444
00:21:09,811 --> 00:21:11,479
Hey, remember that one time
you had a stroke

445
00:21:11,562 --> 00:21:12,855
while you were having a heart attack?

446
00:21:13,898 --> 00:21:15,441
I mean, probably not, I guess,

447
00:21:15,525 --> 00:21:18,111
because it was a massive stroke
that badly damaged your brain.

448
00:21:19,195 --> 00:21:22,073
Anyway, I'm really sad that you're gone.

449
00:21:23,616 --> 00:21:24,951
I hope it wasn't my fault.

450
00:21:26,494 --> 00:21:27,787
I miss you, Felipe.

451
00:21:29,247 --> 00:21:32,000
You're my wildest, craziest friend,

452
00:21:33,418 --> 00:21:36,129
which, again, is why you're dead.

453
00:21:37,255 --> 00:21:38,172
Amen.

454
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,523
You can keep that.

455
00:21:57,984 --> 00:22:01,320
Rollie, the spirits
can't communicate with words.

456
00:22:01,988 --> 00:22:05,366
But we feel their energy,
as they feel ours.

457
00:22:06,951 --> 00:22:11,164
We offer gratitude for Felipe's friendship
and his time on this plane.

458
00:22:29,098 --> 00:22:30,099
Did it work?

459
00:22:30,975 --> 00:22:32,393
Do you feel better?

460
00:22:34,187 --> 00:22:36,230
Yeah. I do.

461
00:22:41,027 --> 00:22:42,487
Ready to say you're sorry now?

462
00:22:42,987 --> 00:22:45,156
No way. Joke's on you.

463
00:22:45,239 --> 00:22:47,950
I dipped the bread in vinegar.
Tastes just like a Jersey Mike's sandwich.

464
00:22:48,034 --> 00:22:49,494
I could stay up here forever.

465
00:22:49,577 --> 00:22:50,453
Really?

466
00:22:50,536 --> 00:22:52,497
No. You gotta get me down.

467
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:54,749
I'm losing my mind. I'm...

468
00:22:56,959 --> 00:22:58,086
...sorry.

469
00:22:58,169 --> 00:22:59,879
I'm so sorry.

470
00:22:59,962 --> 00:23:01,380
Please let me down.

471
00:23:03,132 --> 00:23:04,592
Apology is accepted.

472
00:23:05,593 --> 00:23:07,053
You may now come down.

473
00:23:13,184 --> 00:23:14,268
There you go.

474
00:23:14,352 --> 00:23:15,269
What is that?

475
00:23:15,770 --> 00:23:17,188
Your way down.

476
00:23:17,271 --> 00:23:18,314
Remember?

477
00:23:18,856 --> 00:23:20,525
- Get the ladder.
- No.

478
00:23:20,608 --> 00:23:22,068
- Why not?
- 'Cause I don't want to.

479
00:23:22,151 --> 00:23:23,277
Just jump, idiot.

480
00:23:25,738 --> 00:23:28,407
- Whoa!

481
00:23:28,491 --> 00:23:30,701
Ah! My shoulder!

482
00:23:32,787 --> 00:23:34,372
If I did it, you could do it.

483
00:23:34,997 --> 00:23:36,207
I'm not doing that.

484
00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:37,750
Then you live on the roof now.

485
00:23:38,668 --> 00:23:40,044
Okay. Okay.

486
00:23:40,711 --> 00:23:41,712
Fine.

487
00:23:50,972 --> 00:23:52,807
No!

488
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:55,351
- Oh, my shoulder!

489
00:23:56,686 --> 00:23:58,146
Okay. See you later.

490
00:23:58,229 --> 00:23:59,438
Ah!

491
00:24:05,695 --> 00:24:07,446
- Hey.
- Hey.

492
00:24:08,406 --> 00:24:10,700
{\an8}- How's it going?
- Not great.

493
00:24:11,242 --> 00:24:14,287
{\an8}Your game piece is still making
its way down my intestines.

494
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:15,997
Sounds like cancel culture.

495
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,665
{\an8}- Right?

496
00:24:23,379 --> 00:24:27,091
So... I'm sorry.

497
00:24:28,801 --> 00:24:30,094
I shouldn't have said all that stuff.

498
00:24:30,845 --> 00:24:35,600
Especially since you're sort of the reason
I won that award in the first place.

499
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:37,810
Really? How?

500
00:24:37,894 --> 00:24:41,230
Well, the first time
I ever saw that fancy script,

501
00:24:41,314 --> 00:24:44,609
the words with all the cool
old-timey swirlies on them,

502
00:24:44,692 --> 00:24:46,194
was on your certificate.

503
00:24:47,069 --> 00:24:50,573
I always wanted to have my name on one
so Ma could put it on the wall.

504
00:24:50,656 --> 00:24:52,742
That's why I worked really hard at school.

505
00:24:54,785 --> 00:24:57,914
So you're saying I'm kind of the reason
you wanna go to college?

506
00:24:58,831 --> 00:25:00,541
Yeah, you're part of it for sure.

507
00:25:04,045 --> 00:25:07,381
Uh, so I need your help.

508
00:25:07,465 --> 00:25:09,884
I wanna use the money from the award
to open a bank account.

509
00:25:09,967 --> 00:25:10,885
And since you're the money guy
in the family...

510
00:25:10,968 --> 00:25:12,178
Say no more.

511
00:25:12,261 --> 00:25:14,555
You are smart to come to me with this.

512
00:25:14,639 --> 00:25:17,099
If you wanna join the financial sector,
there are millions of options.

513
00:25:17,183 --> 00:25:18,684
You can open a checking account.

514
00:25:18,768 --> 00:25:20,603
You can open a savings account.

515
00:25:24,899 --> 00:25:26,525
- So two options?
- Yeah, those are the two.

516
00:25:26,609 --> 00:25:29,111
I would go with savings.
You get a better interest rate.

517
00:25:29,195 --> 00:25:30,947
- All right. Let's do it.
- Great.

518
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:32,990
- Let me just get some information.
- Okay.

519
00:25:33,074 --> 00:25:37,411
{\an8}First question, uh,
who or what is a Doja Cat?

520
00:25:38,204 --> 00:25:41,165
It's not for the accountants.
It's for me. Is it a Batman villain?

521
00:25:41,249 --> 00:25:42,583
Is it a place
where you learn martial arts?

522
00:25:42,667 --> 00:25:44,377
- I just, uh, I really need to know.
- Okay.

523
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:46,587
Uh, how about you set up the account,

524
00:25:46,671 --> 00:25:48,714
and I will teach you
about young people stuff.

525
00:25:49,799 --> 00:25:50,675
I would love that.

526
00:25:52,677 --> 00:25:55,805
Okay, let's work up to Doja Cat.

527
00:25:55,888 --> 00:25:58,099
- Okay.
- Let's start off with TikTok.

528
00:25:58,182 --> 00:26:00,226
- I'm sorry?
- You don't know TikTok?

529
00:26:00,309 --> 00:26:02,061
What's TikTok? Is that, like, LinkedIn?

530
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:42,244
Next on  PRIMO...

531
00:27:42,328 --> 00:27:43,412
- Rollie's in jail.

532
00:27:43,496 --> 00:27:45,247
Primo might be able to go to college.

533
00:27:45,331 --> 00:27:48,542
So, if he starts doing the dumb crap
you do 'cause he thinks that's cool,

534
00:27:48,626 --> 00:27:50,628
- that's on you.
- Fight! Fight! Fight!

535
00:27:50,711 --> 00:27:52,546
Oh, damn. Primo!

536
00:27:52,630 --> 00:27:55,049
- What did you do?!
- Oh!

537
00:27:55,132 --> 00:27:57,218
Well, this was fun.

538
00:27:57,301 --> 00:27:58,427
Men are so stupid.
