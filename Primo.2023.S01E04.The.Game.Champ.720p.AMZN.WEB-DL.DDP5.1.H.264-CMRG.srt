1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:02,650
Why didn't you fix that stupid dish?

2
00:00:02,650 --> 00:00:05,406
I tried. The nuts are all stripped.
I can't get them off.

3
00:00:05,489 --> 00:00:08,451
You're using needle-nose pliers
instead of a crescent wrench?

4
00:00:08,534 --> 00:00:09,577
You're such a donkey.

5
00:00:15,916 --> 00:00:19,462
These nuts aren't stripped, they're fine.
Are you a complete moron?

6
00:00:19,545 --> 00:00:21,881
Yes! I got you.

7
00:00:21,964 --> 00:00:23,090
What the hell are you doing?

8
00:00:23,174 --> 00:00:24,842
- Getting you.
- Why?

9
00:00:24,925 --> 00:00:26,469
Revenge, baby.

10
00:00:26,552 --> 00:00:28,068
Revenge for what?

11
00:00:28,068 --> 00:00:30,181
Earlier

12
00:00:30,181 --> 00:00:31,557
{\an8}Yes! I got you.

13
00:00:31,641 --> 00:00:33,601
- What are you doing?
- Getting you.

14
00:00:33,684 --> 00:00:35,036
- Why?
- I don't know.

15
00:00:35,036 --> 00:00:36,400
Your face. It's the worst.

16
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:38,960
Anyway, have fun on the roof
all day, idiot.

17
00:00:39,263 --> 00:00:40,546
Jay.

18
00:00:40,546 --> 00:00:44,820
I was on that roof for 12 hours
for no reason.

19
00:00:44,904 --> 00:00:48,491
No, I told you the reason.
It was your face and how it's the worst.

20
00:00:48,574 --> 00:00:52,870
That very day, around hour four,
I started plotting my revenge.

21
00:00:52,953 --> 00:00:56,791
In 2015, I convinced Drea
to get a satellite TV

22
00:00:56,874 --> 00:00:58,501
by offering to pay for it.

23
00:00:58,584 --> 00:01:01,796
I could barely afford $80 a month,
but it was worth it.

24
00:01:01,879 --> 00:01:06,384
Then I checked the weather,
and I found the perfect, boiling hot day.

25
00:01:06,384 --> 00:01:08,636
We live in San Antonio. Every day is hot.

26
00:01:08,719 --> 00:01:10,221
Shut up! I am talking now!

27
00:01:12,306 --> 00:01:15,643
Then I did research for weeks
on bolts and wrenches,

28
00:01:15,726 --> 00:01:18,354
and then all the stuff
that you know about.

29
00:01:18,437 --> 00:01:23,317
And then today,
after ten years, I pounced.

30
00:01:23,401 --> 00:01:25,277
That was one of the worst days of my life.

31
00:01:25,361 --> 00:01:27,196
And you have never apologized.

32
00:01:27,279 --> 00:01:29,615
So, all you have to do...

33
00:01:30,741 --> 00:01:33,661
say that you're sorry
and I will let you down.

34
00:01:33,744 --> 00:01:35,621
But I know you're never gonna do that.

35
00:01:35,705 --> 00:01:36,580
Never.

36
00:01:36,664 --> 00:01:38,040
So, suck roof.

37
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:42,461
Aww, man,
you guys getting rid of the satellite?

38
00:01:42,461 --> 00:01:44,714
How are you gonna watch
Guatemala Has Talent?

39
00:01:44,797 --> 00:01:45,715
Hey.

40
00:01:45,798 --> 00:01:49,051
Primo's little friend that isn't Miguel,
give me a hand with that ladder.

41
00:01:49,135 --> 00:01:51,804
No. Do not get involved in revenge.

42
00:01:51,887 --> 00:01:54,181
- Don't even look at him.
-  Primo! Primo!

43
00:01:54,265 --> 00:01:56,892
I'm your uncle!
Don't leave me on this roof.

44
00:01:58,769 --> 00:02:01,188
Oh. It's already hot.

45
00:02:02,314 --> 00:02:04,400
I gotta hand it to him.
He did his research.

46
00:02:09,504 --> 00:02:11,912
Game Champ

47
00:02:13,075 --> 00:02:14,285
Hey, everybody!

48
00:02:14,368 --> 00:02:16,579
You see your uncle outside?
Is he sucking roof?

49
00:02:16,662 --> 00:02:20,708
Uh, I have no idea what that means.
But look, I won an award!

50
00:02:20,791 --> 00:02:25,546
The Whataburger What A Student Award.
Oh, my God! That's incredible!

51
00:02:25,629 --> 00:02:27,548
It's 250 bucks.

52
00:02:27,631 --> 00:02:30,676
And this certificate
with all these fancy scripts on it.

53
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,511
Rafa, that's fantastic.

54
00:02:32,595 --> 00:02:34,847
Only two students
in the whole school got these.

55
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:36,849
- Are you the other one who got it?
- No.

56
00:02:36,932 --> 00:02:39,718
Then why are you so excited?
Because I'm Rafa's friend.

57
00:02:40,052 --> 00:02:41,729
I don't know. I think it's weird.

58
00:02:42,396 --> 00:02:43,981
Gimme, gimme.

59
00:02:44,064 --> 00:02:44,940
Wow.

60
00:02:45,024 --> 00:02:48,694
This deserves a place on
the Wall of Accomplishments and Praise.

61
00:02:49,403 --> 00:02:51,989
The Wall of Accomplishments and Praise.

62
00:02:52,072 --> 00:02:53,783
- The WAP.
- Ma, please.

63
00:02:53,866 --> 00:02:55,785
You have to say
the whole name now, remember?

64
00:02:55,868 --> 00:02:57,620
You can't just shorten it anymore.

65
00:02:57,703 --> 00:02:59,830
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
you're taking down my degree?

66
00:02:59,914 --> 00:03:03,125
Degree? I thought Rafa was gonna be
the first one to go to college.

67
00:03:03,125 --> 00:03:06,921
Oh, he is. That's a certificate from
the San Antonio Technological Institute.

68
00:03:06,921 --> 00:03:09,048
Yeah, I have a degree in Computer Science.

69
00:03:09,131 --> 00:03:10,925
You have a certificate in computers.

70
00:03:10,925 --> 00:03:13,033
Your final exam was printing that out.

71
00:03:13,033 --> 00:03:14,845
Drea, you can't move that.

72
00:03:14,929 --> 00:03:17,264
That is a significant
family accomplishment.

73
00:03:17,348 --> 00:03:19,600
You can just hang it up at your place,

74
00:03:19,683 --> 00:03:23,304
right next to your autographed picture
of that sexy blood lady.

75
00:03:23,304 --> 00:03:24,605
Her name is Elizabeth Holmes.

76
00:03:24,605 --> 00:03:27,399
And when she gets out of prison,
she's gonna change the world.

77
00:03:27,483 --> 00:03:28,609
Uh-huh.

78
00:03:28,692 --> 00:03:31,403
Maybe we can just leave
Uncle Ryan's thing up?

79
00:03:31,487 --> 00:03:32,571
See?

80
00:03:32,655 --> 00:03:35,157
Even Primo doesn't care
about a stupid little award.

81
00:03:35,241 --> 00:03:38,494
It's ridiculous these days.
Everybody gets a participation trophy.

82
00:03:38,577 --> 00:03:42,373
I mean, yours literally says,
"Ryan Gonzales participated
in a ten-week computer course."

83
00:03:42,456 --> 00:03:45,668
And it's not stupid.
I worked hard to earn it.

84
00:03:45,751 --> 00:03:48,546
You know what?
I don't like to throw this term around,

85
00:03:48,629 --> 00:03:50,589
- but this is cancel culture.
- Okay.

86
00:03:50,673 --> 00:03:53,092
I feel like you do like
to throw that term around.

87
00:03:53,175 --> 00:03:58,138
Ugh. Not enough bubbles.
Cancel culture.

88
00:03:58,222 --> 00:03:59,473
You're breaking up with me

89
00:03:59,557 --> 00:04:02,351
just because I took a platonic nap
with your sister?

90
00:04:02,434 --> 00:04:04,311
That's cancel culture.

91
00:04:04,395 --> 00:04:09,191
Cell service canceled for non-payment?
You know what this is?

92
00:04:09,275 --> 00:04:11,610
Why do you keep calling everything
cancel culture?

93
00:04:11,694 --> 00:04:12,778
I don't know.

94
00:04:12,862 --> 00:04:16,365
I hear it used a lot, and I don't want
Succession  or  Euphoria

95
00:04:16,365 --> 00:04:17,908
and I don't know who Doja Cat is.

96
00:04:17,992 --> 00:04:19,994
I just wanna be a part of something.

97
00:04:20,077 --> 00:04:22,788
Hey, don't worry, bro.
You are a part of something.

98
00:04:22,872 --> 00:04:25,207
You're part of the people
not on the wall anymore.

99
00:04:25,883 --> 00:04:28,460
Do you think you're being helpful
right now?

100
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:29,859
Let me down, stupid.

101
00:04:29,859 --> 00:04:31,589
- No.
- Mike, let me down.

102
00:04:31,589 --> 00:04:32,673
- No.
- I wanna get down.

103
00:04:32,673 --> 00:04:33,924
- No.
- Let me down.

104
00:04:34,008 --> 00:04:36,176
- No.
- Mike, let me down.

105
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:37,970
- No.
- Mike, I'm serious.

106
00:04:38,053 --> 00:04:39,680
- Go get the ladder.
- No.

107
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,231
Please let me down?

108
00:04:41,682 --> 00:04:42,600
No.

109
00:04:44,351 --> 00:04:48,188
Drea, come on.
I earned my spot on that wall.

110
00:04:48,188 --> 00:04:50,858
I earned my award.
I had to write a ten-page paper.

111
00:04:50,858 --> 00:04:52,610
You just had to learn
how to send some emails.

112
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:54,153
- Nice, Primo.
- Tough.

113
00:04:54,236 --> 00:04:56,405
Okay, listen, it's my house.

114
00:04:56,488 --> 00:04:58,616
- It's my WAP.
- Oh, my God, Ma, please.

115
00:04:58,699 --> 00:05:00,242
And I decide what goes on it.

116
00:05:00,326 --> 00:05:02,912
No. That's not good enough.

117
00:05:02,912 --> 00:05:05,205
There's only one fair way to solve this.

118
00:05:07,675 --> 00:05:11,036
Game Champ.
Winner decides what goes on the wall.

119
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:12,880
What's Game Champ?

120
00:05:12,963 --> 00:05:15,299
It's a Gonzales family Frankenstein.

121
00:05:15,382 --> 00:05:19,303
It's the greatest game ever invented
because it contains all the other games.

122
00:05:19,303 --> 00:05:21,350
Name a game, it's part of Game Champ.

123
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:22,556
- Monopoly?
- Yeah.

124
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,375
- Cranium?
- Hell yeah.

125
00:05:24,375 --> 00:05:25,809
Hungry, Hungry Hippos?

126
00:05:25,809 --> 00:05:27,227
Stop naming games.

127
00:05:27,227 --> 00:05:29,480
- I said it's every game.
-  It's everything.

128
00:05:29,563 --> 00:05:32,358
There's Trivial Pursuit,
Chutes and Ladders,

129
00:05:32,441 --> 00:05:35,778
restaurant menus,
untranslated IKEA instructions.

130
00:05:35,861 --> 00:05:38,572
It combines strategy,
hand-eye coordination,

131
00:05:38,656 --> 00:05:41,659
thigh strength, pain tolerance,
and mental prowess.

132
00:05:41,742 --> 00:05:46,455
And we are not playing.
I can't lie to the police again.

133
00:05:46,538 --> 00:05:48,749
Blood-curdling screams?

134
00:05:48,832 --> 00:05:51,669
No, we... I haven't heard anything like...

135
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:57,716
Whoo! I am the Game Champ!

136
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:00,386
Bow down to the Game Champ!

137
00:06:02,429 --> 00:06:06,016
Look, Game Champ is messy.
But so is the quest for justice.

138
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:07,226
Seriously?

139
00:06:07,309 --> 00:06:10,562
Whatever. Just let us play!
You know you wanna play.

140
00:06:10,646 --> 00:06:12,314
- I kind of do.
- What?

141
00:06:12,314 --> 00:06:14,942
It's Game Champ. I like Game Champ.
Who doesn't like Game Champ?

142
00:06:15,025 --> 00:06:17,903
Yeah. I am fully prepared
to leave him up there for weeks.

143
00:06:17,987 --> 00:06:19,530
Are we playing Game Champ?

144
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:21,699
Oh, I'm in. I call pocket knife.
I'm the pocket knife.

145
00:06:21,782 --> 00:06:23,325
All the knives are gone. Remember?

146
00:06:23,409 --> 00:06:27,663
Because of how Jay almost lost, like,
several of his toes last time.

147
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:31,667
You in, Primo? Or are you chicken fingers?

148
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:33,460
Buk, buk, buk, buk, buk, buk!

149
00:06:33,544 --> 00:06:35,295
- That's a good chicken.
- Thank you.

150
00:06:35,379 --> 00:06:37,756
Fine. I'm in.

151
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,300
- Let's get started.
- I wanna play. Can I play too?

152
00:06:40,384 --> 00:06:43,721
If you're gonna play with us,
you got to learn the official rules.

153
00:06:43,804 --> 00:06:46,181
"Each turn begins with a roll of 12 dice.

154
00:06:46,181 --> 00:06:49,643
The top roll gets to either play a turn
or flick another player's nose.

155
00:06:49,727 --> 00:06:52,855
If they choose nose flick,
it activates 'flick-o-mode.'

156
00:06:52,855 --> 00:06:55,649
{\an8}And whoever gets the most flicks
in one minute begins the turn."

157
00:06:55,733 --> 00:06:56,817
This is insane.

158
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:58,527
Oh, yeah. This game is nuts.

159
00:06:58,527 --> 00:07:01,363
There's only a few hours
until dinner,
so we got to play the short version.

160
00:07:01,447 --> 00:07:04,033
No binge drinking,
no foot races, no moped stunts,

161
00:07:04,116 --> 00:07:06,869
no shoe-swapping,
and no stick-and-poke tattooing.

162
00:07:06,952 --> 00:07:08,537
- Sorry, babe.
-  Oh, wait.

163
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:11,654
{\an8}Harris hasn't played before.
We need to initiate him.

164
00:07:14,501 --> 00:07:16,211
I thought you said knives were gone.

165
00:07:16,295 --> 00:07:17,671
There's always a knife.

166
00:07:17,755 --> 00:07:20,424
Hey, should I sterilize this?
Or are you cool?

167
00:07:21,091 --> 00:07:23,260
- Yeah, I'm out. I'm gonna leave.
- It's for the best.

168
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:26,430
Okay, we're missing
the jar of rancid peanuts
and the throwing stars.

169
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:27,806
I'm on it.

170
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:40,736
Rollie, hurry up. We're starting.

171
00:07:47,367 --> 00:07:48,660
- Oh!
- All right, Mondo,

172
00:07:48,744 --> 00:07:50,704
- you get to spend the pregnancy test.
- Yes!

173
00:07:50,788 --> 00:07:52,449
Hey, I need your help.

174
00:07:52,449 --> 00:07:54,500
- A ghost owes me $40.
- Oh, okay.

175
00:07:54,583 --> 00:07:56,460
As soon as we're done here, I'll help you.

176
00:07:56,543 --> 00:07:59,171
No, this can't wait.
This is urgent ghost business.

177
00:07:59,254 --> 00:08:03,258
Okay, so whoever this lands on
has to eat whatever's in my pocket.

178
00:08:03,342 --> 00:08:05,469
- Okay.
- Oh!

179
00:08:05,552 --> 00:08:07,513
Oh, no.

180
00:08:07,596 --> 00:08:09,223
You have no shirt, you're out.

181
00:08:09,306 --> 00:08:10,474
Uncle Rollie's right.

182
00:08:10,557 --> 00:08:13,602
We instituted that rule after
the  Magic Mike  Challenge of 2018.

183
00:08:13,685 --> 00:08:14,645
Yup.

184
00:08:14,645 --> 00:08:17,397
I had to throw away the whole couch.
Too many body oil stains.

185
00:08:17,481 --> 00:08:19,233
It looked like a giant piece of flan.

186
00:08:19,316 --> 00:08:22,131
Well, I guess I'm out too. Bummer.

187
00:08:22,131 --> 00:08:24,894
Hey, Mondo, come on, let's go.

188
00:08:27,866 --> 00:08:30,536
When I get off this roof,
I'm gonna hit him with a pipe.

189
00:08:30,619 --> 00:08:32,996
No, I'm gonna hit him with a car.

190
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,456
No, I'm gonna hit him...

191
00:08:36,542 --> 00:08:39,703
Sudden Death: This or That. Speed round.

192
00:08:39,703 --> 00:08:41,797
- One of you is dead.
- What's the category?

193
00:08:41,797 --> 00:08:44,591
Actor or disease.
You have one second to answer.

194
00:08:44,675 --> 00:08:45,843
The first wrong answer loses.

195
00:08:45,926 --> 00:08:48,887
Mike, Primo, Drea.
That's the order. Are you ready?

196
00:08:48,887 --> 00:08:50,013
- Got it.
- Here we go.

197
00:08:50,013 --> 00:08:51,265
- Cumberbatch.
- Actor.

198
00:08:51,348 --> 00:08:52,432
- Zika.
- Disease.

199
00:08:52,432 --> 00:08:53,592
- Waititi.
- Actor.

200
00:08:53,592 --> 00:08:54,643
- Fishburne.
- Actor.

201
00:08:54,643 --> 00:08:55,844
- Ventimiglia.
- Actor.

202
00:08:55,844 --> 00:08:56,812
- Ebola.
- Disease.

203
00:08:56,812 --> 00:08:57,980
- Vitiligo.
- Actor.

204
00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:00,399
Wrong. Vitiligo is a disease, dummy.

205
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:02,776
Vitiligo is the guy
from  Lord of the Rings,  dummy.

206
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:05,821
No, that's Viggo Mortensen,
not Vitiligo Mortensen.

207
00:09:05,904 --> 00:09:08,031
- You're out!
- Bye.

208
00:09:08,499 --> 00:09:10,993
You know what?
Everyone at this table can go to hell.

209
00:09:12,327 --> 00:09:15,038
Well, well, well. And then there were two.

210
00:09:15,122 --> 00:09:17,624
- I'm still in.
- Whatever. The two that matter.

211
00:09:24,515 --> 00:09:26,925
Who are you trying to contact
in the spirit world?

212
00:09:27,009 --> 00:09:28,051
Felipe.

213
00:09:28,135 --> 00:09:30,053
Rodeo Clown Felipe or Heart Attack Felipe?

214
00:09:30,137 --> 00:09:33,807
Heart Attack Felipe.
Rodeo Clown Felipe survived the goring.

215
00:09:33,891 --> 00:09:37,603
Oh, that's good.
That was a big hole. Right in his chest.

216
00:09:37,686 --> 00:09:39,438
-  It's water balloon bingo!
-  Yeah.

217
00:09:39,521 --> 00:09:41,398
Water balloon bingo is my favorite.

218
00:09:41,481 --> 00:09:43,275
- Come on, let's go.

219
00:09:43,358 --> 00:09:45,444
Okay.

220
00:09:45,527 --> 00:09:48,280
Let's see if the spirit world
wants to communicate with us.

221
00:09:48,363 --> 00:09:50,574
W-H-Y. Why?

222
00:09:50,657 --> 00:09:54,870
Maybe Heart Attack Felipe wants to know
why you made me stop playing Game Champ

223
00:09:54,953 --> 00:09:56,914
or why you ruined my favorite shirt.

224
00:09:56,997 --> 00:09:58,457
No. I know what this is.

225
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:00,542
Hey, you took that bet
fair and square, Felipe.

226
00:10:00,542 --> 00:10:02,544
Nobody forced you to jump that ditch.

227
00:10:02,628 --> 00:10:04,838
- Jump that ditch! Jump that ditch!
- Are you ready, old man?

228
00:10:04,922 --> 00:10:06,715
Jump that ditch!

229
00:10:06,798 --> 00:10:10,677
My arm is numb, my chest is tight,
and my mouth tastes like metal.

230
00:10:10,761 --> 00:10:12,221
Let's do this!

231
00:10:22,231 --> 00:10:26,235
He died doing what he loved.
Losing control of a vehicle.

232
00:10:32,574 --> 00:10:33,659
Forty-six.

233
00:10:36,545 --> 00:10:39,331
Monologue Jungle.
Recite a monologue from a movie.

234
00:10:39,414 --> 00:10:42,084
One wrong word and you're out.

235
00:10:42,167 --> 00:10:43,669
- Okay.
- Okay. Here we go.

236
00:10:44,828 --> 00:10:48,757
"Tony Montana,  Scarface.
Political prisoner monologue."

237
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:49,925
Easy.

238
00:10:50,008 --> 00:10:52,386
- All right, here you go. Keep track.

239
00:10:52,469 --> 00:10:55,180
As always, I will be substituting
desert foods for all the cuss words.

240
00:10:55,264 --> 00:10:56,431
- Okay.

241
00:10:59,810 --> 00:11:02,646
Do you know
I eat octopus three times a day?

242
00:11:02,729 --> 00:11:06,024
I got fudging octopus
coming out of my fudging ears, man.

243
00:11:06,108 --> 00:11:09,444
I got the fudging Russian shoes,
my feet's comin' through. Huh?

244
00:11:09,528 --> 00:11:10,862
How'd you like that?

245
00:11:10,946 --> 00:11:12,656
What, you want me to stay there
and do nothing?

246
00:11:12,739 --> 00:11:15,617
Hey, I'm no fudging criminal, man.

247
00:11:15,701 --> 00:11:17,536
I'm no pudding nor thief.

248
00:11:17,619 --> 00:11:21,290
I Tony Montana,
a political prisoner from Cuba.

249
00:11:21,373 --> 00:11:23,750
And I want my fudgin' human rights!

250
00:11:23,834 --> 00:11:25,377
Wow.

251
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:29,047
- That was great! Amazing!
- Thank you.

252
00:11:29,131 --> 00:11:30,590
Unfortunately, you're out.

253
00:11:30,674 --> 00:11:33,427
What? No way. I nailed it.

254
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:35,595
Ooh, but you didn't.

255
00:11:35,679 --> 00:11:38,598
It's, "And I want
my fudgin' human rights now,"

256
00:11:38,598 --> 00:11:40,892
not, "And I want my fudgin' human rights."

257
00:11:40,892 --> 00:11:42,811
- You forgot the "now."
-  He's right.

258
00:11:42,894 --> 00:11:45,981
It has to be word-perfect.
That's the rule.

259
00:11:46,773 --> 00:11:47,816
Out.

260
00:11:50,569 --> 00:11:51,570
That's cool.

261
00:11:59,077 --> 00:12:00,287
It's down to you and me.

262
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:01,747
Bullshit!

263
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:04,374
Headband is up for grabs.

264
00:12:06,293 --> 00:12:09,588
I'm getting another message. Yes.

265
00:12:10,756 --> 00:12:11,923
S-I-N-G.

266
00:12:12,507 --> 00:12:15,052
He wants you to sing a song in his honor.

267
00:12:15,135 --> 00:12:16,636
What song?

268
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:19,389
I think, hmm, yes,
he wants you to make one up.

269
00:12:19,473 --> 00:12:23,101
He wants you to invent a song
in tribute to his life.

270
00:12:24,269 --> 00:12:26,480
He says, make it good,

271
00:12:26,563 --> 00:12:29,358
or he's going to haunt the ... out of you.

272
00:12:29,441 --> 00:12:30,984
Yeah, that does sound like him.

Hey, man,
I'm getting kind of hungry up here.

284
00:13:05,769 --> 00:13:08,814
Oh, I'm sorry, bud. I got you a sandwich.

285
00:13:16,863 --> 00:13:17,989
Sock sandwich?

286
00:13:21,368 --> 00:13:22,619
I'm not gonna eat this.

287
00:13:22,702 --> 00:13:25,497
You didn't give me any food
when I was trapped up there, so...

288
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:27,457
Let it go. We were kids.

289
00:13:27,541 --> 00:13:29,251
You were 30. Bon appetit.

I have bad news.

It seems your awful singing
has angered Heart Attack Felipe.

292
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:37,926
And he's in the room.

293
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,470
Heart Attack Felipe's here?

294
00:13:40,554 --> 00:13:43,348
Yes, as his younger self.

295
00:13:43,432 --> 00:13:46,768
He's ripped, man. And he's after you.

296
00:13:47,436 --> 00:13:52,441
He says he doesn't owe you a crap.
In fact, he says you owe him the 40 bucks.

297
00:13:52,524 --> 00:13:56,695
Nah, no way.
Hey, look, man. We made a bet. You lost.

298
00:13:56,778 --> 00:13:58,641
You had a heart attack, you died.

299
00:13:58,641 --> 00:14:00,991
So you owe me 40 bucks. Hey, fair's fair.

300
00:14:00,991 --> 00:14:02,742
That's not how he sees it.

301
00:14:03,377 --> 00:14:05,328
He says you should give me the money.

302
00:14:05,412 --> 00:14:07,122
- Give it to you?
- Yes.

303
00:14:07,205 --> 00:14:10,208
I am a bridge between realms.

304
00:14:10,292 --> 00:14:13,253
So, if you give the money to me,
I can make sure he gets it.

305
00:14:13,879 --> 00:14:15,797
I only charge $10 for the service.

306
00:14:15,881 --> 00:14:17,549
So 50 total.

307
00:14:18,925 --> 00:14:21,636
He wants you to give me the $50.

308
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:24,598
Fine.

309
00:14:25,849 --> 00:14:27,142
- Fine?
- Yeah.

310
00:14:27,225 --> 00:14:29,102
I mean, this is what I was worried about.

311
00:14:30,237 --> 00:14:33,982
Some people say that since the front tires
touched the other wall of the ditch,

00:14:34,065 --> 00:14:37,235
that technically, he made it across.
So, I lost the bet.

313
00:14:37,861 --> 00:14:42,282
But to me, the bet was whether Felipe
would make the jump, not the car.

314
00:14:42,365 --> 00:14:45,160
He clearly didn't,
because he was dead in the ditch.

315
00:14:45,744 --> 00:14:48,079
But I don't even care about any of that.

316
00:14:49,039 --> 00:14:52,542
I just miss my friend
and I don't want him to be mad at me.

317
00:14:56,897 --> 00:14:58,965
Can you ask him if he's mad at me?

318
00:15:01,301 --> 00:15:03,303
Rollie.

319
00:15:07,516 --> 00:15:09,684
Come on. I know what to do.

320
00:15:15,857 --> 00:15:18,151
Yeah! Give me that money.

321
00:15:19,211 --> 00:15:20,612
Tea Pot Dome Scandal.

322
00:15:20,695 --> 00:15:21,696
The Magna Carta.

323
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:23,615
- Adele Dazeem.
- Thin Mints.

324
00:15:24,866 --> 00:15:26,535
Yes!

325
00:15:26,618 --> 00:15:28,078
You like that?

326
00:15:31,206 --> 00:15:33,166
Jeffrey Dahmer and Winston Churchill.

327
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:36,711
Oh, no. Is it the human femur?

328
00:15:36,795 --> 00:15:38,880
Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit.

329
00:15:38,964 --> 00:15:42,092
J-A-M-I-R-O-Q-U-A-I, Jamiroquai.

330
00:15:42,175 --> 00:15:43,885
Five seconds left.

331
00:15:43,969 --> 00:15:45,929
- You need every word.
- Almost done.

332
00:15:46,012 --> 00:15:48,181
- Here we go.

333
00:15:48,265 --> 00:15:50,308
- What is that?
- I found every word.

334
00:15:50,392 --> 00:15:52,352
That doesn't count.
You just circled everything.

335
00:15:52,435 --> 00:15:55,188
Yes, and within that circle
lies every single word.

336
00:15:55,272 --> 00:15:56,856
I win.

337
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:59,818
No, you don't. That clearly doesn't count.
It's my turn.

338
00:15:59,901 --> 00:16:02,821
And all I need to do
is roll higher than four,

339
00:16:02,821 --> 00:16:05,198
which I did, because there are 12 dice.

340
00:16:05,282 --> 00:16:07,617
And that is ga...

341
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:09,995
Dude.

342
00:16:11,454 --> 00:16:15,041
If you swallow your opponent's game piece,
you win Game Champ.

343
00:16:15,125 --> 00:16:17,369
- That's not a rule.
- It is now.

344
00:16:17,369 --> 00:16:19,504
Explain how eating a piece of metal
makes you the smartest.

345
00:16:19,588 --> 00:16:23,091
How does winning an award
from a burger place make you the smartest?

346
00:16:23,174 --> 00:16:27,387
It doesn't. I win. Game over. Game Champ.

347
00:16:27,387 --> 00:16:28,805
Ryan, may I speak with you in the kitchen?

348
00:16:28,805 --> 00:16:30,015
Oh, no. I just ate. Thank you.

349
00:16:30,098 --> 00:16:31,516
- Get in here.
- Mm-hmm.

350
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:42,110
Hey, Primo, do me a favor.
Take these out to your Uncle Jay.

351
00:16:42,193 --> 00:16:45,739
- Oh, no, I am not getting involved.
- Please?

352
00:16:45,822 --> 00:16:48,116
He's been up there a really long time.
I'm starting to feel bad.

353
00:16:48,199 --> 00:16:49,993
I'm just not ready to admit that.

354
00:16:51,036 --> 00:16:52,078
Okay.

355
00:16:55,415 --> 00:16:58,335
Let's play a new game.
It's called Drea's Lie Detector.

356
00:16:58,418 --> 00:17:00,920
The way it works is
I'm gonna ask you questions.

357
00:17:01,004 --> 00:17:02,964
And if you lie to me, I smack you.

358
00:17:02,964 --> 00:17:04,215
I do not wanna play this.

359
00:17:04,215 --> 00:17:06,551
Are you so insecure
that you think winning this game

360
00:17:06,551 --> 00:17:09,346
will prove that you're better
than your 16-year-old nephew?

361
00:17:09,429 --> 00:17:11,931
No. We're just playing a fun game.

362
00:17:12,724 --> 00:17:15,769
Fine. Yes.
I wanna prove I'm better than Primo.

363
00:17:15,852 --> 00:17:20,315
And you realize how silly it is
that a grown man is jealous of a child?

364
00:17:20,398 --> 00:17:22,108
It's not silly.

365
00:17:22,192 --> 00:17:26,237
It's very silly. Yes, I see that.

366
00:17:26,321 --> 00:17:29,074
And you realize
that this is your nephew, who you love,

367
00:17:29,157 --> 00:17:31,618
and him winning an award
should make you proud of him?

368
00:17:32,619 --> 00:17:33,520
Well...

369
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,372
Uh, now, hold on.

370
00:17:35,372 --> 00:17:37,717
Okay, if you look at it
in a certain way...

371
00:17:37,717 --> 00:17:38,875
No, you're right.

372
00:17:38,875 --> 00:17:40,919
I love him and I will apologize.

373
00:17:41,002 --> 00:17:42,587
Thank you.

374
00:17:42,671 --> 00:17:44,714
But this really is cancel culture.

375
00:17:46,216 --> 00:17:47,634
Go ahead.

376
00:17:47,717 --> 00:17:49,636
What's "cancel culture"?

377
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:54,516
Hey, Uncle Mike asked me
to give these to you.

378
00:17:54,599 --> 00:17:57,018
I think he's starting to feel bad.

379
00:17:57,102 --> 00:17:58,228
Oh, thank God.

380
00:18:04,067 --> 00:18:07,195
This is vinegar. Primo, you got involved.

381
00:18:07,278 --> 00:18:10,031
No, I didn't. I swear.
Uncle Mike tricked me.

382
00:18:10,115 --> 00:18:13,201
And I just got distracted,
all the stuff with Uncle Ryan.

383
00:18:13,284 --> 00:18:16,788
He's coming at me so hard,
it's making me wanna fight him.

384
00:18:18,915 --> 00:18:21,042
Listen to me very carefully, Primo.

385
00:18:23,253 --> 00:18:24,713
Follow that instinct.

386
00:18:24,796 --> 00:18:25,839
Really?

387
00:18:26,339 --> 00:18:29,159
You can't ever back down. Look at me.

388
00:18:29,159 --> 00:18:30,844
I've been on this roof for hours.

389
00:18:30,844 --> 00:18:32,887
I'm sunburned, I'm starving,

390
00:18:32,887 --> 00:18:35,432
and I'm two minutes from pooping
in whatever pipe that is.

391
00:18:35,515 --> 00:18:36,766
Please don't poop down a pipe.

392
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:39,686
The point is,
you can't let people push you around.

393
00:18:39,686 --> 00:18:42,397
I'd rather stay up here for a month
than let Mike win.

394
00:18:51,156 --> 00:18:52,824
I forgot it was vinegar.

395
00:18:54,576 --> 00:18:56,578
Hey, Primo. We need to talk.

396
00:18:56,661 --> 00:18:57,871
Yeah, we do.

397
00:18:57,954 --> 00:19:00,248
I earned that spot on that wall
and I'm taking it.

398
00:19:00,331 --> 00:19:01,708
Whoa. What's going on?

399
00:19:01,791 --> 00:19:04,252
I won fair and square. I'm the Game Champ.

400
00:19:04,335 --> 00:19:08,673
I'm one of only two
Whataburger What A Students
in the entire South San Antonio Region.

401
00:19:08,757 --> 00:19:11,634
My certificate
deserves to be on that wall.

402
00:19:12,719 --> 00:19:15,555
Well, you've given me
a lot to think about.

403
00:19:23,271 --> 00:19:24,397
Where are you going?

404
00:19:35,208 --> 00:19:38,161
Why did your Uncle Ryan
just run out of our house with your award?

405
00:19:38,161 --> 00:19:40,789
Because he's a weirdo.
He's probably gonna try to eat it.

406
00:19:40,789 --> 00:19:42,081
I played a game with Ryan

407
00:19:42,081 --> 00:19:44,670
where every time he said something dumb,
I slapped him.

408
00:19:44,670 --> 00:19:47,504
I'm not gonna do that with you
because you're a child.

409
00:19:47,587 --> 00:19:50,840
But also because
you should be smart enough
to understand what you did wrong.

410
00:19:50,924 --> 00:19:52,675
How is this my fault?

411
00:19:53,676 --> 00:19:58,681
Rafa, look, Ryan feels threatened.

412
00:19:58,765 --> 00:20:01,684
He's always thought of himself
as the smart one in the family.

413
00:20:01,768 --> 00:20:03,770
And then you come along.

414
00:20:03,853 --> 00:20:06,481
And you're, you know,
might be going to college

415
00:20:06,564 --> 00:20:09,192
and you're winning burger awards.

416
00:20:09,275 --> 00:20:11,736
Now he is acting like a buffoon.

417
00:20:12,987 --> 00:20:15,824
But maybe you can try and understand
what he's feeling.

418
00:20:16,533 --> 00:20:18,743
But what am I supposed to do about it?

419
00:20:18,827 --> 00:20:20,870
You're a Whataburger What A Student.

420
00:20:20,954 --> 00:20:24,082
You ought to be able
to what-a-figure it out.

421
00:20:25,208 --> 00:20:27,752
Nope. That was bad.

422
00:20:27,836 --> 00:20:30,922
But all the other stuff I said
was good and wise.

423
00:20:32,257 --> 00:20:33,258
Okay.

424
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,009
Okay.

425
00:20:36,261 --> 00:20:39,097
- Are you sure about this?
- Yeah.

426
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:41,599
This is where Felipe crossed over.

427
00:20:41,683 --> 00:20:43,560
Literally and figuratively.

428
00:20:44,561 --> 00:20:45,937
He'll hear you.

429
00:20:51,401 --> 00:20:52,569
What's up, Felipe?

430
00:20:54,362 --> 00:20:57,448
Man, this is crazy.

431
00:20:57,532 --> 00:20:58,700
You're really gone.

432
00:21:00,076 --> 00:21:01,744
I thought you were gonna live forever.

433
00:21:02,996 --> 00:21:04,414
I mean, lifetime record
against heart attacks?

434
00:21:04,497 --> 00:21:05,707
You were ten and one.

435
00:21:06,541 --> 00:21:07,792
That's pretty good.

436
00:21:09,511 --> 00:21:11,379
Hey, remember that one time
you had a stroke

437
00:21:11,462 --> 00:21:12,755
while you were having a heart attack?

438
00:21:13,798 --> 00:21:15,341
I mean, probably not, I guess,

439
00:21:15,425 --> 00:21:18,011
because it was a massive stroke
that badly damaged your brain.

440
00:21:19,095 --> 00:21:21,973
Anyway, I'm really sad that you're gone.

441
00:21:23,516 --> 00:21:24,851
I hope it wasn't my fault.

442
00:21:26,194 --> 00:21:27,687
I miss you, Felipe.

443
00:21:29,147 --> 00:21:31,900
You're my wildest, craziest friend,

444
00:21:33,318 --> 00:21:36,029
which, again, is why you're dead.

445
00:21:37,155 --> 00:21:38,072
Amen.

446
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:55,423
You can keep that.

447
00:21:57,884 --> 00:22:01,220
Rollie, the spirits
can't communicate with words.

448
00:22:01,888 --> 00:22:05,266
But we feel their energy,
as they feel ours.

449
00:22:06,851 --> 00:22:11,064
We offer gratitude for Felipe's friendship
and his time on this plane.

450
00:22:28,998 --> 00:22:29,999
Did it work?

451
00:22:30,875 --> 00:22:32,293
Do you feel better?

452
00:22:34,087 --> 00:22:36,130
Yeah. I do.

453
00:22:40,927 --> 00:22:42,387
Ready to say you're sorry now?

454
00:22:42,887 --> 00:22:45,006
No way. Joke's on you.

455
00:22:45,006 --> 00:22:47,900
I dipped the bread in vinegar.
Tastes just like a Jersey Mike's sandwich.

456
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:49,394
I could stay up here forever.

457
00:22:49,477 --> 00:22:50,353
Really?

458
00:22:50,436 --> 00:22:52,397
No. You gotta get me down.

459
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,649
I'm losing my mind. I'm...

460
00:22:56,859 --> 00:22:57,986
...sorry.

461
00:22:58,069 --> 00:22:59,779
I'm so sorry.

462
00:22:59,862 --> 00:23:01,280
Please let me down.

463
00:23:03,032 --> 00:23:04,492
Apology is accepted.

464
00:23:05,493 --> 00:23:06,953
You may now come down.

465
00:23:13,084 --> 00:23:14,168
There you go.

466
00:23:14,252 --> 00:23:17,088
- What is that?
- Your way down.

467
00:23:17,171 --> 00:23:18,214
Remember?

468
00:23:18,756 --> 00:23:20,425
- Get the ladder.
- No.

469
00:23:20,425 --> 00:23:21,968
- Why not?
- 'Cause I don't want to.

470
00:23:21,968 --> 00:23:23,277
Just jump, idiot.

471
00:23:28,391 --> 00:23:30,601
Ah! My shoulder!

472
00:23:32,687 --> 00:23:34,272
If I did it, you could do it.

473
00:23:34,897 --> 00:23:36,107
I'm not doing that.

474
00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:37,650
Then you live on the roof now.

475
00:23:38,568 --> 00:23:39,944
Okay. Okay.

476
00:23:40,611 --> 00:23:41,612
Fine.

477
00:23:50,872 --> 00:23:52,707
No!

478
00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:55,251
- Oh, my shoulder!

479
00:23:56,586 --> 00:23:58,046
Okay. See you later.

480
00:24:05,595 --> 00:24:07,346
- Hey.
- Hey.

481
00:24:08,306 --> 00:24:10,600
{\an8}- How's it going?
- Not great.

482
00:24:11,142 --> 00:24:14,187
{\an8}Your game piece is still making
its way down my intestines.

483
00:24:14,270 --> 00:24:17,565
Sounds like cancel culture.
{\an8}- Right?

484
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:26,991
So... I'm sorry.

485
00:24:28,501 --> 00:24:30,194
I shouldn't have said all that stuff.

486
00:24:30,745 --> 00:24:35,500
Especially since you're sort of the reason
I won that award in the first place.

487
00:24:36,375 --> 00:24:37,710
Really? How?

488
00:24:37,794 --> 00:24:41,130
Well, the first time
I ever saw that fancy script,

489
00:24:41,214 --> 00:24:44,459
the words with all the cool
old-timey swirlies on them,

490
00:24:44,459 --> 00:24:46,294
was on your certificate.

491
00:24:46,969 --> 00:24:50,473
I always wanted to have my name on one
so Ma could put it on the wall.

492
00:24:50,556 --> 00:24:52,642
That's why I worked really hard at school.

493
00:24:54,685 --> 00:24:57,814
So you're saying I'm kind of the reason
you wanna go to college?

494
00:24:58,731 --> 00:25:00,441
Yeah, you're part of it for sure.

495
00:25:03,945 --> 00:25:07,281
Uh, so I need your help.

496
00:25:07,281 --> 00:25:09,784
I wanna use the money from the award
to open a bank account.

497
00:25:09,784 --> 00:25:12,078
- And since you're the money guy
in the family...
- Say no more.

498
00:25:12,161 --> 00:25:14,405
You are smart to come to me with this.

499
00:25:14,405 --> 00:25:16,999
If you wanna join the financial sector,
there are millions of options.

500
00:25:16,999 --> 00:25:20,503
You can open a checking account.
You can open a savings account.

501
00:25:24,099 --> 00:25:26,460
- So two options?
- Yeah, those are the two.

502
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:29,011
I would go with savings.
You get a better interest rate.

503
00:25:29,095 --> 00:25:30,847
- All right. Let's do it.
- Great.

504
00:25:30,930 --> 00:25:32,890
- Let me just get some information.
- Okay.

505
00:25:32,974 --> 00:25:37,311
{\an8}First question, uh,
who or what is a Doja Cat?

506
00:25:37,704 --> 00:25:41,065
It's not for the accountants.
It's for me. Is it a Batman villain?

507
00:25:41,149 --> 00:25:42,483
Is it a place
where you learn martial arts?

508
00:25:42,483 --> 00:25:44,360
- I just, uh, I really need to know.
- Okay.

509
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:46,487
Uh, how about you set up the account,

510
00:25:46,571 --> 00:25:48,614
and I will teach you
about young people stuff.

511
00:25:49,699 --> 00:25:50,575
I would love that.

512
00:25:52,577 --> 00:25:55,705
Okay, let's work up to Doja Cat.

513
00:25:55,788 --> 00:25:57,999
- Okay.
- Let's start off with TikTok.

514
00:25:58,082 --> 00:26:00,126
- I'm sorry?
- You don't know TikTok?

515
00:26:00,126 --> 00:26:02,061
What's TikTok? Is that, like, LinkedIn?

516
00:26:04,511 --> 00:26:11,384
Six years
