1
00:00:01,501 --> 00:00:04,052
Cheers is filmed
before a live studio audience.

2
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:06,088
Woody's a
married man, huh? Yeah.

3
00:00:06,155 --> 00:00:08,123
Yeah, what a lucky guy.

4
00:00:08,191 --> 00:00:11,560
Indeed, he is.
There's nothing
like wedded bliss.

5
00:00:11,627 --> 00:00:13,562
Plus, he's got
that wedding ring.

6
00:00:13,629 --> 00:00:16,864
Now, that is a real babe magnet.

7
00:00:16,916 --> 00:00:18,984
Please, it's an old wives' tale.

8
00:00:19,052 --> 00:00:20,319
Not so. Yeah?

9
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,620
Oh, it's been scientifically
proven that women

10
00:00:22,621 --> 00:00:24,689
are more attracted
to married men.

11
00:00:25,725 --> 00:00:27,526
The whole notion is ridiculous.

12
00:00:27,527 --> 00:00:29,094
Look, I'll...
I'll prove it to you.

13
00:00:29,095 --> 00:00:31,113
You see those two attractive
young females over there?

14
00:00:31,114 --> 00:00:33,020
I'll go over and hit on them
relentlessly,

15
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:35,367
all the while
displaying my wedding ring.

16
00:00:35,435 --> 00:00:38,537
See how long it takes them
to give me the cold shoulder.

17
00:00:48,464 --> 00:00:49,797
Hi.

18
00:00:49,798 --> 00:00:52,968
You two ladies
need some company?

19
00:00:52,969 --> 00:00:55,637
Oh, sure, I'm married, but, uh,
you know, I'm not dead.

20
00:00:57,607 --> 00:00:59,040
I figure, well, uh...

21
00:01:06,232 --> 00:01:08,466

Sam, uh, Malone.

37
00:02:23,896 --> 00:02:25,229
Yeah, over here.

38
00:02:25,264 --> 00:02:26,914
GNS Amusements.

39
00:02:26,915 --> 00:02:27,915
Oh, great.

40
00:02:27,916 --> 00:02:29,350
Sign here, please.

41
00:02:29,351 --> 00:02:31,185
Hey, fellas, listen
up, you know how

42
00:02:31,186 --> 00:02:33,888
I've been trying to
hustle up more business
for the bar?

43
00:02:33,889 --> 00:02:36,290
Well, I think this
baby's just the ticket.

44
00:02:36,442 --> 00:02:38,609
Cheers is now the proud owner

45
00:02:38,677 --> 00:02:40,377
of a blood pressure tester.

46
00:02:42,013 --> 00:02:43,481
That's... that's great, Sammy.

47
00:02:43,549 --> 00:02:47,551
I think we ought to get
some velvet ropes outside
to handle the lines.

48
00:02:47,586 --> 00:02:48,986
No, no, come on, will you?

49
00:02:49,054 --> 00:02:51,688
Lighten up here,
this could be fun.

50
00:02:51,756 --> 00:02:54,758
What the hell is this?
They sent me a slot machine.

51
00:02:54,877 --> 00:02:57,767
Well, I lived kind of a
sheltered girlhood, but offhand,

52
00:02:57,796 --> 00:03:01,565
I'd say this looks like
a Gametime model 36X

53
00:03:01,634 --> 00:03:04,769
with remodelled sprockets,
triple-action tumblers.

54
00:03:04,837 --> 00:03:06,270
"The Big Boy".

55
00:03:07,723 --> 00:03:10,341
A slot machine.

56
00:03:10,342 --> 00:03:12,977
I've never played one of these,
but I've always wanted to.

57
00:03:12,978 --> 00:03:15,580
Hey, hey, come on, no, don't...
don't do that, please,
it's illegal.

58
00:03:15,581 --> 00:03:17,382
This is the last thing
this bar needs.

59
00:03:17,383 --> 00:03:19,553
I'm gonna call and tell
them to take it back.

60
00:03:19,618 --> 00:03:21,418
It's just as well, Rebecca.

61
00:03:21,487 --> 00:03:24,822
These are the devil's
own machines.

62
00:03:24,823 --> 00:03:28,609
They systematically rob you
of your cash and your dignity,

63
00:03:28,677 --> 00:03:29,944
one nickel at a time.

64
00:03:30,012 --> 00:03:31,412
Allow me to demonstrate.

65
00:03:31,413 --> 00:03:32,830
Oh, hey, come on,
Frasier, don't do that.

66
00:03:32,831 --> 00:03:33,897
No, relax, Sam.

67
00:03:33,898 --> 00:03:35,633
This is merely for
educational purposes.

68
00:03:35,634 --> 00:03:36,918
Good-bye, nickel.

69
00:03:43,742 --> 00:03:44,909
Free money!

70
00:03:44,927 --> 00:03:46,560
The doctor is hot!

71
00:03:48,731 --> 00:03:49,781
Excuse me, sir.

72
00:03:49,782 --> 00:03:51,465
I represent a market
research company.

73
00:03:51,466 --> 00:03:52,516
We're doing a survey.

74
00:03:52,517 --> 00:03:53,735
Oh, I'm really not interested.

75
00:03:53,736 --> 00:03:54,936
Thanks. Okay.

76
00:03:54,937 --> 00:03:56,253
How about you, sir? Okay.

77
00:03:56,254 --> 00:03:57,655
We're looking for volunteers

78
00:03:57,656 --> 00:03:59,657
to taste several brands of beer.

79
00:03:59,775 --> 00:04:02,293
Uh, excuse me, Paul,
we were having
a conversation here.

80
00:04:02,294 --> 00:04:04,328
You were saying? Uh, uh, well,

81
00:04:04,446 --> 00:04:06,998
if you're available,
just come to this address

82
00:04:07,066 --> 00:04:09,133
at 2:00 this afternoon.
2:00, sure.

83
00:04:09,201 --> 00:04:11,435
Hey, listen, uh, uh,
what exactly do I do?

84
00:04:11,453 --> 00:04:14,756
Well, you'll be in a room
with several other volunteers,

85
00:04:14,757 --> 00:04:17,291
and you'll be tasting
several varieties of beer.

86
00:04:17,292 --> 00:04:18,659
We'll pay you for your time.

87
00:04:18,711 --> 00:04:21,379
Excuse me, sir.

88
00:04:21,446 --> 00:04:23,914
This is gonna sound like
an odd question, but...

89
00:04:23,982 --> 00:04:26,817
by any chance, were
you born in a manger?

90
00:04:33,319 --> 00:04:37,528
You've been selected
to take part in this study

91
00:04:37,529 --> 00:04:40,030
due to your ages
and your drinking preferences.

92
00:04:40,098 --> 00:04:42,132
Norm, there seems to be a typo

93
00:04:42,201 --> 00:04:44,301
here on your average
beer intake.

94
00:04:47,756 --> 00:04:49,524
Wow.

95
00:04:49,625 --> 00:04:50,908
Now, gentlemen,

96
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:52,877
I'd like you to each take a sip

97
00:04:52,944 --> 00:04:55,613
from sample A and give me
your impressions.

98
00:04:57,249 --> 00:04:58,916
Ray, what do you think?

99
00:04:58,917 --> 00:05:00,618
Would you serve this beer
in your home?

100
00:05:00,619 --> 00:05:02,653
Yeah, sure.

101
00:05:02,654 --> 00:05:03,604
And Chuck?

102
00:05:03,605 --> 00:05:05,322
Very tasty, uh...

103
00:05:06,341 --> 00:05:08,175
Good after-taste, too.

104
00:05:08,176 --> 00:05:09,276
And Norm.

105
00:05:09,277 --> 00:05:10,777
I don't know.

106
00:05:10,846 --> 00:05:12,379
Didn't you just drink some?

107
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:15,482
Yeah, but it wasn't in my mouth
long enough to really taste it.

108
00:05:17,236 --> 00:05:19,236
Hold it in your mouth
a little longer.

109
00:05:19,304 --> 00:05:22,506
Try savouring it for a second,
and then swallow it.

110
00:05:26,111 --> 00:05:27,912
This is great.

111
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:30,848
Wow, does anyone else know
about this savouring thing?

112
00:05:36,171 --> 00:05:37,838
Now try to describe the taste.

113
00:05:37,923 --> 00:05:40,291
Ah... well,
it's kind of, um, sweet,

114
00:05:40,358 --> 00:05:42,326
but, uh, kind of tangy, too.

115
00:05:42,394 --> 00:05:43,560
You know what I mean?

116
00:05:43,561 --> 00:05:44,695
Yeah... very observant.

117
00:05:44,696 --> 00:05:46,664
Yeah. What about sample B?

118
00:05:51,053 --> 00:05:52,753
It's kind of tart.

119
00:05:52,754 --> 00:05:55,940
Actually, I thought it
was kind of sweet.

120
00:05:55,941 --> 00:05:59,610
No, no, fellas.
It's really... it's...
it's more of a smoky thing.

121
00:05:59,728 --> 00:06:00,911
Right again. Yeah.

122
00:06:00,979 --> 00:06:03,146
That's the new mash
that they're using.

123
00:06:03,214 --> 00:06:04,715
You're amazing, Norm.

124
00:06:06,985 --> 00:06:08,795
What about,
uh, sample C? Let's see.

125
00:06:12,206 --> 00:06:13,956
Now, this one
misses for me, okay?

126
00:06:13,957 --> 00:06:15,642
Mm-hmm.
It's like the carbonation is...

127
00:06:15,643 --> 00:06:18,762
is fighting the flavour,
and the flavour is losing.

128
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:20,760
This is really getting
too easy for me.

129
00:06:20,765 --> 00:06:22,767
You want to challenge
me a bit here?

130
00:06:23,704 --> 00:06:28,572
Okay.
Let's try samples
D through V.

131
00:06:28,573 --> 00:06:30,691
Oh, D through V.
Now, hang on a second.

132
00:06:30,742 --> 00:06:34,311
I may need to cleanse my palate.
Do you have any pizza?

133
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:46,490
Oh, Carla, you're not supposed
to be playing that-
it's illegal.

134
00:06:46,491 --> 00:06:49,760
So is watering drinks.

135
00:06:49,828 --> 00:06:51,729
Good luck to you.

136
00:06:56,968 --> 00:06:58,402
Come to mama.

137
00:07:03,008 --> 00:07:06,110
Come on, come on, come on.

138
00:07:06,178 --> 00:07:08,445
Darn it, this machine hates me!

139
00:07:08,513 --> 00:07:10,881
Say, uh, Rebecca, uh,
can I give it a try?

140
00:07:10,949 --> 00:07:14,034
Go ahead, Paul.
It's obviously empty.

141
00:07:22,527 --> 00:07:26,396
Wow.
Nine nickels.

142
00:07:26,397 --> 00:07:29,066
Hey, I wonder, if those chicks
over there saw me win, huh?

143
00:07:29,067 --> 00:07:31,858
Yeah, Paul.
I'm sure the lack
of that 45 cents

144
00:07:31,903 --> 00:07:33,771
is what kept you
out of that ménage.

145
00:07:37,542 --> 00:07:41,328
Come on... come on.
Be there, be there.

146
00:07:41,396 --> 00:07:43,063
Damn!

147
00:07:43,131 --> 00:07:46,066
What is wrong with this machine?

148
00:07:46,134 --> 00:07:49,303
Frasier won, Paul won,
Carla won.

149
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:52,206
Maybe it just hates women.

150
00:07:52,274 --> 00:07:53,590
Afternoon, everybody.

151
00:07:53,658 --> 00:07:55,459
Norm!

152
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:56,677
What's the story, Norm?

153
00:07:56,678 --> 00:07:58,862
Boy meets beer.
Boy drinks beer.

154
00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:00,430
Boy gets another beer.

155
00:08:00,498 --> 00:08:02,600
In this performance,
the role of the boy

156
00:08:02,667 --> 00:08:04,297
will be played by Norm Peterson.

157
00:08:04,298 --> 00:08:08,172
Sammy, I want you
to pour a round
for the house and
put it on my tab.

158
00:08:09,441 --> 00:08:10,491
Oh, thank you.

159
00:08:10,492 --> 00:08:11,576
What's the occasion there,
big guy?

160
00:08:11,577 --> 00:08:14,406
- Well, I think I got a job.
- Hey, all right, Normie.

161
00:08:14,406 --> 00:08:17,697
CLIFF:
Stand back,
I'll take care of this.

162
00:08:17,698 --> 00:08:21,719
All right, mister, I don't know
what pod you crawled out of...

163
00:08:21,786 --> 00:08:23,787
but you're not welcome
in our world.

164
00:08:23,855 --> 00:08:26,025
Now, go in peace and give us
our Normie back.

165
00:08:26,026 --> 00:08:30,044
Seriously, remember that beer
tasting survey group?

166
00:08:30,045 --> 00:08:31,812
Turns out they value
my opinion so much,

167
00:08:31,813 --> 00:08:33,847
they want me to try
out at the brewery.

168
00:08:33,915 --> 00:08:35,048
All right.

169
00:08:35,116 --> 00:08:38,218
Who'd have thought I have
a knack for something?

170
00:08:38,286 --> 00:08:41,071
Okay, now, listen up, you.

171
00:08:41,139 --> 00:08:43,540
This is my last nickel.

172
00:08:43,608 --> 00:08:45,409
Now, I'm not asking for a lot.

173
00:08:45,477 --> 00:08:47,561
I-I just want you to hit,
just once.

174
00:08:47,628 --> 00:08:48,729
Please... for me.

175
00:08:54,635 --> 00:08:57,037
Why do you hate me?

176
00:08:58,606 --> 00:08:59,790
Becs. What?

177
00:08:59,858 --> 00:09:02,042
Come here.
What do you want?

178
00:09:04,045 --> 00:09:06,296
You are acting crazy.

179
00:09:06,364 --> 00:09:08,832
You're standing there
talking to a machine,

180
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:11,568
pretending like it cares
who's feeding it nickels.

181
00:09:11,636 --> 00:09:14,504
It doesn't have anything
against you personally.

182
00:09:14,572 --> 00:09:16,824
You're right.
Thank you.

183
00:09:16,875 --> 00:09:18,325
And why are you whispering?

184
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:21,728
I don't want it to hear
me talking to you.

185
00:09:32,157 --> 00:09:34,424
Pardon me, uh, are you Mike?

186
00:09:34,425 --> 00:09:36,093
Hey, you must be
the new guy, Norm?

187
00:09:36,094 --> 00:09:37,895
Yeah, hi.
Yeah, I'll be your supervisor.

188
00:09:37,896 --> 00:09:38,946
Oh, great.

189
00:09:38,947 --> 00:09:41,265
I was, uh, looking over
your sample comments,

190
00:09:41,266 --> 00:09:44,601
and, uh, well,
must say they're
very impressive.

191
00:09:44,669 --> 00:09:47,338
Thank you. Uh, now,
remember, this is just a trial,

192
00:09:47,339 --> 00:09:49,039
but I think
you're gonna do great.

193
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:49,957
Thanks, sir.

194
00:09:49,958 --> 00:09:51,158
Uh, the job's very simple.

195
00:09:51,159 --> 00:09:54,295
You'll drink
random samples of beer
off the line
and give us your opinion.

196
00:09:54,296 --> 00:09:55,346
That's it.

197
00:09:56,564 --> 00:09:58,065
Well, uh...

198
00:09:58,133 --> 00:10:00,067
you ready to see
the brewery, Norm?

199
00:10:00,135 --> 00:10:02,736
Oh, I've been ready
for 43 years, sir.

200
00:10:07,158 --> 00:10:08,692
You'll be sampling beer

201
00:10:08,693 --> 00:10:11,028
and submitting your comments
to the master brewer

202
00:10:11,029 --> 00:10:14,198
who will evaluate them,
and in turn, he'll...

203
00:10:16,168 --> 00:10:18,018
Are you... are you crying, Norm?

204
00:10:18,954 --> 00:10:22,272
Nah, just got something
in my eye there.

205
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:24,407
I'll get you a Kleenex.

206
00:10:32,483 --> 00:10:34,718
Honey, I'm home.

207
00:11:27,052 --> 00:11:28,152
Hey, Mike.

208
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:31,122
Look, if you don't mind,
I'm gonna knock off
for lunch, okay?

209
00:11:31,123 --> 00:11:32,223
Yeah, sure.

210
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:33,925
You had a great
first week, Norm.

211
00:11:33,926 --> 00:11:35,893
You don't have to tell me, sir.

212
00:11:35,894 --> 00:11:37,962
It was the happiest week
of my life.

213
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,296
Here you go, Norm.

214
00:11:39,364 --> 00:11:40,765
Huh? What's this?

215
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:42,534
It's your pay-check.

216
00:11:42,601 --> 00:11:44,469
Oh, no, sir, I couldn't.

217
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:46,971
No, no, absolutely not,
not for this.

218
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:48,640
Go ahead, take it! Really?

219
00:11:48,707 --> 00:11:49,807
You've earned it.

220
00:11:49,808 --> 00:11:52,911
You know, you were right
about that timer being off
on number three tank.

221
00:11:52,912 --> 00:11:56,213
That's, uh... that's something
our computer should have
picked up a long time ago.

222
00:11:56,214 --> 00:11:59,483
Well, sir,
a computer can't love.

223
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:02,186
As far as I'm concerned,
the job is yours.

224
00:12:02,254 --> 00:12:03,487
Oh, really? Yeah.

225
00:12:03,488 --> 00:12:07,025
There's-There's just
one more thing. Yeah?
It's, uh... it's mostly
a formality... Yeah.

226
00:12:07,026 --> 00:12:10,962
But, uh, well, you have
to meet with Mr. Hoffmeyer,
the president of the brewery.

227
00:12:10,963 --> 00:12:13,681
Now, if Hoffmeyer likes you,
well, you're all set.

228
00:12:13,748 --> 00:12:17,001
What kind of
guy is he? Oh, he's...
a bit of a tough cookie,

229
00:12:17,002 --> 00:12:20,038
but, uh, if you take your work
seriously, you'll do just fine.

230
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:22,306
Okay. Well, I'd be
glad to meet the guy. Good.

231
00:12:22,307 --> 00:12:25,643
Listen, if you don't
mind right now,
I've been tasting beer
all morning, okay?

232
00:12:25,644 --> 00:12:28,012
So, I'm just gonna take a
break, change my clothes

233
00:12:28,013 --> 00:12:30,048
and go over to Cheers
and hoist a few.

234
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:32,867
You're, uh...
You're kidding, right?

235
00:12:32,935 --> 00:12:34,569
Yeah. These clothes
will be fine.

236
00:12:44,029 --> 00:12:45,964
Come on. Big money.

237
00:12:52,037 --> 00:12:54,572
Come on. Big money.

238
00:12:56,075 --> 00:12:57,875
Oh, show me I'm not a loser.

239
00:12:57,943 --> 00:13:00,612
Can't believe
you're still playing this thing.

240
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:04,181
Sam, I have pulled
that handle 578 times,

241
00:13:04,182 --> 00:13:06,084
and this machine
has given me nothing.

242
00:13:06,085 --> 00:13:08,886
Well, may... maybe it's broken.
Let me try it here.

243
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:10,354
Give me that.

244
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:19,897
No. No. It's you, all right.

245
00:13:28,757 --> 00:13:32,043
Come on. Big money.

246
00:13:32,111 --> 00:13:34,646
I hate to see her beating
herself up like that.

247
00:13:34,713 --> 00:13:36,047
Yeah, I agree.

248
00:13:36,115 --> 00:13:39,250
If there was just some way
that she could win, even once.

249
00:13:39,317 --> 00:13:41,218
It might serve
to break her fatalism

250
00:13:41,286 --> 00:13:44,055
and bolster her self-esteem.

251
00:13:44,123 --> 00:13:47,925
Plus, maybe then I'd get a shot,
'cause I am hot, hot, hot!

252
00:13:47,926 --> 00:13:51,963
Well, there must
be some way we can fix that machine

253
00:13:51,964 --> 00:13:53,465
so you can win just one time.

254
00:13:53,532 --> 00:13:55,600
Now you're good
at this stuff, Carla.

255
00:13:55,601 --> 00:13:56,667
Can't you rig it?

256
00:13:56,668 --> 00:13:57,668
Why should I?

257
00:13:57,669 --> 00:14:00,605
Well, because
she'd feel better about herself,

258
00:14:00,606 --> 00:14:02,840
you know, maybe even feel happy.

259
00:14:02,908 --> 00:14:04,325
No, really. Why should I?

260
00:14:06,796 --> 00:14:09,597
Because there's a $20 bill
in it for you.

261
00:14:09,665 --> 00:14:10,932
Deal.

262
00:14:12,367 --> 00:14:13,535
I'd have done it for ten.

263
00:14:13,602 --> 00:14:15,592
No wonder
you're going out of business.

264
00:14:17,272 --> 00:14:18,640
Afternoon, everybody.

265
00:14:18,707 --> 00:14:20,207
Norm!

266
00:14:20,275 --> 00:14:21,976
A little busman's holiday, Norm?

267
00:14:22,044 --> 00:14:24,345
No. None of those fancy drinks
for me, Sammy.

268
00:14:24,413 --> 00:14:26,247
Just give me a beer.

269
00:14:26,315 --> 00:14:30,243
See this, boys? Huh?
An actual pay-check.

270
00:14:30,519 --> 00:14:32,053
Tell you what, Sammy.

271
00:14:32,054 --> 00:14:34,756
Earning a salary
does something for a guy's self-esteem.

272
00:14:34,757 --> 00:14:36,524
For the first time in years,

273
00:14:36,592 --> 00:14:38,726
I'm actually making
an honest living.

274
00:14:38,794 --> 00:14:40,462
Oh, look at that.

275
00:14:40,529 --> 00:14:43,164
This says Norm Peterman.

276
00:14:43,165 --> 00:14:44,632
That's 'cause Norm Peterson

277
00:14:44,633 --> 00:14:46,803
is still drawing
unemployment, thank you.

278
00:14:46,804 --> 00:14:49,304
Well, Norm, I must say
I've never seen you

279
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:50,471
look happier
or-or more fulfilled.

280
00:14:50,472 --> 00:14:51,739
Well, thanks, Fras.

281
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:53,457
I still don't have
the job officially yet.

282
00:14:53,458 --> 00:14:55,426
I got to meet the
president of the brewery.

283
00:14:55,427 --> 00:14:58,077
But I tell you what-I feel
like I've found my calling.

284
00:14:58,078 --> 00:14:59,564
Yeah, that's a wonderful
feeling, isn't it? Yeah.

285
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:03,751
You know, I remember
the first day I decided
to go into the healing arts.

286
00:15:03,818 --> 00:15:07,688
Yeah, just the thought
of helping my fellow man...

287
00:15:07,756 --> 00:15:12,305
it gave me a sense of purpose,
a mission in life.

288
00:15:13,395 --> 00:15:14,762
Oh, surprise, surprise!

289
00:15:14,829 --> 00:15:17,231
Mrs. Davis.
"I had a bad childhood."

290
00:15:17,299 --> 00:15:19,867
Join the club, sister!

291
00:15:19,868 --> 00:15:23,421
I'm all out of nickels.
Does anybody have a nickel?

292
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:25,323
Hey, hey, where's that, uh,
tip jar of Carla's?

293
00:15:25,324 --> 00:15:28,126
- No.
- Well, I would
pay her back.

294
00:15:28,127 --> 00:15:30,311
Going a little bit
overboard here, aren't you?

295
00:15:30,312 --> 00:15:32,496
After all, it's just
a silly little machine.

296
00:15:32,497 --> 00:15:34,065
It's not a silly
machine, Norman.

297
00:15:34,066 --> 00:15:36,100
It is... It is a
metaphor for life.

298
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:37,768
It is. Everybody gets
to pull the handle,

299
00:15:37,769 --> 00:15:40,087
and sometimes they win,
and sometimes they lose.

300
00:15:40,088 --> 00:15:42,557
But I always lose.

301
00:15:42,624 --> 00:15:45,542
I pull the handle, and
I get cherry, lemon,

302
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:48,445
Bell!

303
00:15:48,446 --> 00:15:51,316
Rebecca, has it ever occurred
to you that maybe the reason

304
00:15:51,317 --> 00:15:54,419
you always lose is because
you think you're going to lose?

305
00:15:54,486 --> 00:15:56,154
Oh, don't give me that crap!

306
00:15:56,155 --> 00:15:57,922
I tried that positive
thinking stuff,

307
00:15:57,923 --> 00:16:01,059
and I knew it wouldn't work,
and sure enough, it didn't!

308
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:04,963
You are over-analysing things.
You got to live in the moment.

309
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:06,697
Take life as it comes, okay?

310
00:16:06,765 --> 00:16:09,667
You start thinking too much,
everything falls apart.

311
00:16:09,735 --> 00:16:11,936
Norm, how do you not
think too much?

312
00:16:11,937 --> 00:16:15,339
You're-You're getting ready
for the biggest interview
of your life!

313
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:16,573
Yeah.

314
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:19,243
If I were you,
I would be a nervous wreck.

315
00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:23,380
- You know, I had a shot
at my dream job.
- Yeah?

316
00:16:23,448 --> 00:16:25,482
And I-I did really, really well.

317
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:30,788
And then it came time
for me to meet the big boss,
and I choked.

318
00:16:30,856 --> 00:16:33,024
I went in, and-and
I complimented him,

319
00:16:33,091 --> 00:16:35,441
and then I realized,
"Oh, God, I'm kissing up."

320
00:16:35,442 --> 00:16:37,061
So I took back the compliment,

321
00:16:37,062 --> 00:16:40,330
and then it looked like
I was insulting him.

322
00:16:40,398 --> 00:16:43,517
So then I started telling jokes,
and they were really bad.

323
00:16:43,585 --> 00:16:46,254
And then... And-And then,
the next thing I knew,

324
00:16:46,321 --> 00:16:52,327
I was singing,
"Knick knack paddy whack" song.

325
00:16:52,394 --> 00:16:55,162
And I was just singing

326
00:16:55,230 --> 00:16:58,098
and singing at the top
of my lungs.

327
00:16:58,166 --> 00:17:02,536
And I just kept burying myself
deeper and deeper.

328
00:17:02,604 --> 00:17:05,490
And I lost my dream job.

329
00:17:07,692 --> 00:17:09,994
And when I walked out

330
00:17:10,062 --> 00:17:13,931
of that House of Pancakes,
I felt two inches tall.

331
00:17:20,072 --> 00:17:23,141
Well, Rebecca, that's about
the most depressing thing

332
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:25,243
I've ever heard in my life.

333
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:27,120
Hey, don't... Norm,
don't listen to me.

334
00:17:27,146 --> 00:17:28,413
It'll just bring you down.

335
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,747
Yeah. And you know what?

336
00:17:29,814 --> 00:17:32,616
I've been a jinx my entire life,

337
00:17:32,684 --> 00:17:35,953
but that's me.
That isn't you.

338
00:17:36,021 --> 00:17:37,688
You're gonna do great.

339
00:17:37,756 --> 00:17:40,191
Thanks.
Good luck.

340
00:17:40,192 --> 00:17:41,559
Well, thanks a lot, Rebecca.

341
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,793
And for what it's worth,

342
00:17:42,861 --> 00:17:44,895
I don't think you're
a jinx, all right?

343
00:17:44,963 --> 00:17:46,230
Thanks.

344
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:06,433
Ah, Norm.

345
00:18:06,501 --> 00:18:08,302
Mr. Hoffmeyer's on his way.

346
00:18:08,303 --> 00:18:10,170
Uh, now remember,
this is just a formality.

347
00:18:10,171 --> 00:18:12,306
He's heard all kinds
of good things about you,

348
00:18:12,307 --> 00:18:14,809
and, well, I'm sure
that as soon as he meets you,

349
00:18:14,810 --> 00:18:17,144
uh, you'll be a permanent part
of this brewery.

350
00:18:17,145 --> 00:18:19,279
You seem a little nervous.
Are you, Norm?

351
00:18:19,347 --> 00:18:21,598
No. No.

352
00:18:21,666 --> 00:18:23,450
Oh, Mr. Hoffmeyer,

353
00:18:23,518 --> 00:18:25,636
I'd like you to meet
our star taster, Norm.

354
00:18:25,704 --> 00:18:26,870
Norm, Mr. Hoffmeyer.

355
00:18:26,938 --> 00:18:29,348
Norm, I hear you're doing
excellent work for us.

356
00:18:29,374 --> 00:18:30,841
Thank you very much, sir.

357
00:18:32,377 --> 00:18:33,611
Nice pants.

358
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:37,915
I can't believe
I just said that.

359
00:18:37,983 --> 00:18:39,883
Look, I'm not trying
to kiss up, sir.

360
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:42,362
I take back what I said
about those pants, okay?

361
00:18:42,363 --> 00:18:43,887
Not that they're not nice pants.

362
00:18:43,888 --> 00:18:46,557
I mean, of course they are.
They're-They're-They're
great pants, you know.

363
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:50,428
I just don't want you to think
that all I'm doing is
looking at your pants.

364
00:18:50,429 --> 00:18:52,239
I'm also looking
at your face, sir,

365
00:18:52,264 --> 00:18:55,732
and-and your shirt, your
tie, all of which are lovely.

366
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:58,485
Like a manly kind of lovely.
You know what I mean?

367
00:18:58,553 --> 00:19:01,488
Good Lord, I'm not making
much sense, am I, sir?

368
00:19:01,556 --> 00:19:03,323
Let me just start
all over again.

369
00:19:03,391 --> 00:19:05,259
Hello. My name is Norm Pants.

370
00:19:05,326 --> 00:19:08,596
Ooh! Yay. That didn't come
out right, either, did it?

371
00:19:08,597 --> 00:19:11,132
I'm gonna laugh
about that one tonight, sir.

372
00:19:11,133 --> 00:19:12,650
And I'm sure you will, too,

373
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:14,585
when you take those
pants off tonight.

374
00:19:14,586 --> 00:19:17,522
Not that I'm thinking
about you taking
your pants off, sir!

375
00:19:17,523 --> 00:19:19,089
Nothing could be
further from the truth!

376
00:19:19,090 --> 00:19:20,924
I mean, well, now,
don't get me wrong.

377
00:19:20,925 --> 00:19:24,525
You know, it's not like
I would be grossed out
if you took your pants off.

378
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:27,448
Go ahead, run around
naked for all I care!

379
00:19:27,515 --> 00:19:30,168
After all, you'll do
whatever you want to do.

380
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:32,203
You're Mr. Hoffmeyer,
for crying out loud!

381
00:19:32,204 --> 00:19:34,472
Oh, come on, lighten
up, will you?!

382
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:36,457
Why are you such a sourpuss?

383
00:19:36,524 --> 00:19:40,394
Come on. What's it going to take
to put a smile on
that face, huh?

384
00:19:40,462 --> 00:19:43,714
♪ With a knick knack paddy
whack, give a dog a bone ♪

385
00:19:43,782 --> 00:19:46,517
♪ This old man
came rolling home! ♪

386
00:19:48,826 --> 00:19:51,788
Sorry about the job there, Norm.

387
00:19:51,789 --> 00:19:53,124
Oh, don't worry about it, Cliff.

388
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:54,458
What are you going to do?

389
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:57,261
I had my dream job for
a week, and I lost it.

390
00:19:57,262 --> 00:19:59,213
But you've got to look on the...
on the bright side, you know.

391
00:19:59,214 --> 00:20:01,548
I mean, somebody could
walk up to me tomorrow,

392
00:20:01,549 --> 00:20:03,050
tap me on the shoulder, say,

393
00:20:03,051 --> 00:20:05,686
"Hey, we want you to sample
various types of pretzels."

394
00:20:07,573 --> 00:20:09,306
Or-Or-Or pizza.

395
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:10,474
Could happen.

396
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:12,609
Maybe, big guy.

397
00:20:13,912 --> 00:20:16,029
Well, I did it.
I rigged the machine.

398
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:18,031
The next person who pulls
that handle is going

399
00:20:18,032 --> 00:20:19,722
to be up to their
knees in nickels.

400
00:20:19,723 --> 00:20:21,268
All right, now,
don't you feel good?

401
00:20:21,269 --> 00:20:23,003
I mean, doesn't it
make you feel happy

402
00:20:23,004 --> 00:20:25,172
to know you did something
for a fellow human being?

403
00:20:25,173 --> 00:20:26,774
Isn't that what life's
really all about?

404
00:20:26,775 --> 00:20:29,026
You don't have my 20
bucks, do you, Sam?

405
00:20:29,027 --> 00:20:30,911
It's been kind of
a slow week, honey. I...

406
00:20:30,912 --> 00:20:33,514
Now, wai-wai-wait.

407
00:20:34,999 --> 00:20:36,467
Norm.

408
00:20:36,535 --> 00:20:39,203
I just wanted to tell you

409
00:20:39,271 --> 00:20:41,271
how sorry I am
about this afternoon.

410
00:20:41,339 --> 00:20:44,475
Rebecca, for the hundredth
time, please relax.

411
00:20:44,543 --> 00:20:45,810
It wasn't your fault.

412
00:20:45,810 --> 00:20:48,211
I did it myself.
I choked under pressure.

413
00:20:48,213 --> 00:20:50,514
Well, I felt so guilty
that I went out

414
00:20:50,582 --> 00:20:52,616
and got us this quart
of ice cream.

415
00:20:59,942 --> 00:21:02,643
This is what we losers do, Norm.

416
00:21:04,546 --> 00:21:06,997
We just drown our sorrows
in ice cream.

417
00:21:08,699 --> 00:21:13,036
But you know what?
At least we're not alone.

418
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:14,738
We have each other.

419
00:21:14,806 --> 00:21:17,091
You're not going to
kiss me again, are you?

420
00:21:17,159 --> 00:21:19,093
'Cause I still
have to drive home.

421
00:21:20,962 --> 00:21:23,064
Oh! Hey, look at that.

422
00:21:23,065 --> 00:21:24,732
These are nickels, I guess, huh?

423
00:21:24,733 --> 00:21:27,735
Say, why don't you, uh, play
the slot machine one more time?

424
00:21:27,736 --> 00:21:28,836
Because I will lose.

425
00:21:28,837 --> 00:21:30,370
Where have you been all week?

426
00:21:30,371 --> 00:21:32,239
No. You know,
I feel good about this.

427
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,241
Why-Why-Why don't you give it
one more shot?

428
00:21:34,242 --> 00:21:35,876
No. Oh, come on!

429
00:21:35,877 --> 00:21:39,079
What's it gonna take
for you to understand
that I will never win?

430
00:21:39,147 --> 00:21:40,948
All right, fine, fine. Come on.

431
00:21:41,016 --> 00:21:42,783
Everybody step up while

432
00:21:42,851 --> 00:21:45,603
Lady Luck thumbs her nose
at Rebecca Howe.

433
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:57,615
I got my nickel back.

434
00:21:57,616 --> 00:21:59,633
I thought that thing
was supposed to pay off.

435
00:21:59,634 --> 00:22:02,069
It's been paying off all week.
I guess it's empty.

436
00:22:02,137 --> 00:22:03,287
Oh, I'm sorry.

437
00:22:03,355 --> 00:22:05,189
Sorry?

438
00:22:05,257 --> 00:22:08,258
This has never happened
to me before.

439
00:22:10,595 --> 00:22:13,097
I broke even.

440
00:22:13,164 --> 00:22:15,599
I've never broken even before.

441
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:17,834
I'm not a loser.

442
00:22:17,902 --> 00:22:20,270
I'm a break-evener.

443
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:23,340
Norm is a loser.

444
00:22:23,408 --> 00:22:25,675
See him eating his ice cream?

445
00:22:26,186 --> 00:22:28,579
You know what this means?

446
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:30,581
It means
that my life isn't so terrible.

447
00:22:30,649 --> 00:22:32,650
It's... It's so-so!

448
00:22:34,202 --> 00:22:36,137
Isn't this great?!

449
00:22:37,239 --> 00:22:41,309
Hey, guys,
did Rebecca call me a loser?

450
00:22:41,376 --> 00:22:43,311
I'm afraid so, Norm.

451
00:22:43,378 --> 00:22:46,913
Good. I thought she said,
"Leave me some."

452
00:22:46,913 --> 00:23:06,680
translate
