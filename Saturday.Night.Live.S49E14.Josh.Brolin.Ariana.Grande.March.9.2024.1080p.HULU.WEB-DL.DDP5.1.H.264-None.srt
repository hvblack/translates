1
00:00:01,026 --> 00:00:03,603
>>> YOU'RE WATCHING CNN.

2
00:00:04,059 --> 00:00:07,397
>> GOOD EVENING.
I'M ABBY PHILLIP.

3
00:00:10,292 --> 00:00:12,441
IF YOU'RE JUST JOINING US,

4
00:00:12,441 --> 00:00:15,849
PRESIDENT BIDEN HAS FINISHED
DELIVERING HIS STATE OF THE
UNION ADDRESS.

5
00:00:15,948 --> 00:00:19,166
BIDEN NEEDED TO SHOW ENERGY
TONIGHT, AND HE DIDN'T
DISAPPOINT.

6
00:00:19,166 --> 00:00:22,876
AFTER A BRIEF 45 MINUTES OF
SELFFIES ON THE WAY TO THE PODIUM,

7
00:00:22,876 --> 00:00:25,194
BIDEN BEGAN HIS SPEECH
WITH A BANG.

8
00:00:25,194 --> 00:00:26,983
LET'S TAKE A LOOK.

9
00:00:27,383 --> 00:00:31,861
>> ALL RIGHT.
THANK YOU, THANK YOU.
ALL RIGHT.

10
00:00:31,861 --> 00:00:36,429
I JUST POUNDED A CELSIUS.
LET'S DO THIS.

11
00:00:40,674 --> 00:00:43,006
ALL RIGHT.
OKAY.

12
00:00:43,006 --> 00:00:45,420
MR. SPEAKER,

13
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:47,584
TOO SLOW.

14
00:00:48,373 --> 00:00:51,120
LET'S GO.

15
00:00:51,212 --> 00:00:53,732
ALL RIGHT, EVERYBODY. FOLKS,

16
00:00:53,732 --> 00:00:57,020
TONIGHT, I'M GOING TO
COVER A LOT.

17
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:59,303
THERE'S GOING TO BE A LOT OF
APPLAUSE.

18
00:00:59,393 --> 00:01:03,527
SO KAMALA, I HOPE YOU DIDN'T
SKIP LEG DAY, GIRL.

19
00:01:03,527 --> 00:01:06,586
YOU'RE GOING TO BE UP AND DOWN
ALL NIGHT.

20
00:01:06,586 --> 00:01:09,849
YEAH, THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING
ABOUT!

21
00:01:11,277 --> 00:01:13,410
LET'S GO!

22
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:17,703
NOW TONIGHT, I'M ALSO GOING TO
BE TALKING ABOUT MY PREDECESSOR,

23
00:01:17,703 --> 00:01:21,910
MAINLY BECAUSE EVERY TIME I SAY
PREDECESSOR,

24
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:24,707
MIKE JOHNSON SHAKES HIS HEAD

25
00:01:24,707 --> 00:01:29,834
LIKE HE JUST
ACCIDENTALLY CUT 30 SECONDS OF
THE SHOW EUPHORIA.

26
00:01:29,834 --> 00:01:32,593
LOOK AT THAT WEIRDO.

27
00:01:32,593 --> 00:01:36,716
I ACTUALLY TRIED TO FIX THE
BORDER CRISIS,

28
00:01:36,716 --> 00:01:41,026
BUT THE BILL WAS
TANKED BY MY PREDECESSOR.

29
00:01:42,875 --> 00:01:46,067
OH, OH, OH, YOU DON'T LIKE THAT?
OH, YOU DON'T LIKE THAT?

30
00:01:46,067 --> 00:01:49,055
ANYBODY WANT TO SAY SOMETHING TO
ME?

31
00:01:49,055 --> 00:01:53,229
>> I DO.
BOO!
LIAR.

32
00:01:53,229 --> 00:01:56,094
>> DAMN IT.

33
00:01:56,094 --> 00:01:59,695
WHOA.
MARGERY,

34
00:01:59,695 --> 00:02:02,747
YEAH, THANKS FOR
DRESSING UP TONIGHT.

35
00:02:02,747 --> 00:02:07,227
YOU KNOW, I WOULD STAY HERE AND
TALK TO Y'ALL MORE,

36
00:02:07,227 --> 00:02:12,065
BUT I SAW A
GLIMPSE OF THE REPUBLICAN
SENATOR'S RESPONSE TO MY SPEECH,

37
00:02:12,065 --> 00:02:16,901
AND I THINK SHE'S GOING TO HELP
ME MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE I CAN
SAY HERE.

38
00:02:16,901 --> 00:02:19,323
ENJOY.

39
00:02:19,392 --> 00:02:22,327
>> ALL IN ALL, A STRONG SPEECH
FROM PRESIDENT BIDEN.

40
00:02:22,327 --> 00:02:25,677
BUT LET'S FOLLOW HIS ADVICE AND
TAKE A LOOK AT THE REPUBLICAN RESPONSE

41
00:02:25,677 --> 00:02:28,999
FROM ALABAMA JUNIOR
SENATOR, KATIE BRITT.

42
00:02:32,427 --> 00:02:36,785
>> GOOD EVENING, AMERICA.
MY NAME IS KATIE BRITT.

43
00:02:36,785 --> 00:02:39,821
AND I HAVE THE HONOR OF

44
00:02:39,821 --> 00:02:43,608
SERVING THE GREAT PEOPLE OF ALABAMA.

45
00:02:43,608 --> 00:02:49,326
BUT TONIGHT, I'LL BE AUDITIONING
FOR THE PART OF SCARY MOM.

46
00:02:49,326 --> 00:02:52,364
AND I'LL BE PERFORMING AN
ORIGINAL MONOLOGUE

47
00:02:52,364 --> 00:02:54,947
CALLED THIS
COUNTRY IS HELL.

48
00:02:54,947 --> 00:03:00,129
YOU SEE, I'M NOT JUST A SENATOR,
I'M A WIFE, A MOTHER,

49
00:03:00,129 --> 00:03:04,139
AND THE
CRAZIEST BITCH IN THE TARGET
PARKING LOT.

50
00:03:04,139 --> 00:03:08,407
I'M WORRIED ABOUT THE FUTURE OF
OUR CHILDREN,

51
00:03:08,407 --> 00:03:13,907
AND THIS IS WHY
I'VE INVITED YOU INTO THIS
STRANGE, EMPTY KITCHEN.

52
00:03:13,907 --> 00:03:18,829
BECAUSE REPUBLICANS WANTED ME TO
APPEAL TO WOMAN VOTERS,

53
00:03:18,829 --> 00:03:21,926
AND
WOMEN LOVE KITCHEN.

54
00:03:21,926 --> 00:03:26,381
BUT SERIOUSLY, MY HUSBAND WESLEY AND I

55
00:03:26,381 --> 00:03:29,348
JUST WATCHED PRESIDENT
BIDEN'S SPEECH,

56
00:03:29,348 --> 00:03:34,368
AND WHAT I SAW
WAS THE PERFORMANCE OF A
PERMANENT POLITICIAN.

57
00:03:34,368 --> 00:03:37,406
BUT ME, I'M NOT PERFORMING.

58
00:03:37,406 --> 00:03:40,508
I'M NOT.
I'M NOT.

59
00:03:41,435 --> 00:03:45,950
BUT FIRST AND FOREMOST, I'M A
MOM.

60
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:49,696
AND LIKE ANY MOM, I'M GOING TO
DO A PIVOT OUT OF NOWHERE

61
00:03:49,696 --> 00:03:54,222
INTO A
SHOCKINGLY VIOLENT STORY ABOUT
SEX TRAFFICKING.

62
00:03:54,222 --> 00:03:58,848
AND REST ASSURED, EVERY DETAIL
ABOUT IT IS REAL,

63
00:03:58,848 --> 00:04:01,784
EXCEPT THE YEAR, WHERE IT TOOK PLACE,

64
00:04:01,784 --> 00:04:04,856
AND
WHO WAS PRESIDENT WHEN IT
HAPPENED.

65
00:04:04,856 --> 00:04:09,833
AND TONIGHT, I AM NOT JUST
RESPONDING TO THE STATE OF THE
UNION.

66
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:15,047
I AM ALSO SELLING THESE GORGEOUS
BEJEWELED CROSS QUICK LASSES FOR
QVC.

67
00:04:15,047 --> 00:04:18,372
THIS AFINTY DIAMOND NECKLACE
GOES WITH ANYTHING,

68
00:04:18,372 --> 00:04:21,765
AND YOU CAN
WEAR IT FROM DA CHURCH TO DA
CLUB.

69
00:04:21,878 --> 00:04:28,246
AND NOW I'M GOING TO GET REALLY
SEDUCTIVE FOR NO APPARENT
REASON.

70
00:04:28,246 --> 00:04:31,139
AS I WAS SAYING,

71
00:04:31,139 --> 00:04:36,746
THE AMERICAN DREAM HAS TURNED INTO A
NIGHTMARE.

72
00:04:37,773 --> 00:04:40,837
YOU KNOW, MY HUSBAND WESLEY AND I

73
00:04:40,837 --> 00:04:45,218
SPEND A LOT OF TIME IN THIS
KITCHEN WORRYING.

74
00:04:45,218 --> 00:04:51,040
KITCHENS ARE WHERE FAMILIES HAVE
THE HARD CONVERSATIONS.

75
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,118
LIKE THE ONE WE'LL HAVE TOMORROW

76
00:04:53,118 --> 00:04:57,324
ABOUT HOW MOMMY FREAKED OUT THE
ENTIRE COUNTRY.

77
00:04:57,324 --> 00:05:03,104
BUT, Y'ALL, BIDEN'S THE ONE WHO
IS DESTROYING OUR COUNTRY.

78
00:05:03,104 --> 00:05:05,064
JUST ASK YOURSELF,

79
00:05:05,064 --> 00:05:09,327
ARE YOU BETTER OFF TODAY THAN YOU WERE
FOUR YEARS AGO?

80
00:05:09,327 --> 00:05:12,074
BACK IN THE GOOD OLD DAYS OF 2020,

81
00:05:12,074 --> 00:05:15,063
THE YEAR THAT NOTHING BAD
HAPPENED.

82
00:05:15,063 --> 00:05:18,251
♪ AND IT CAN BE THAT WAY AGAIN ♪

83
00:05:18,335 --> 00:05:23,793
OH, GOSH, I GUESS I CAN SING.
THAT'S SO GREAT.

84
00:05:23,866 --> 00:05:27,198
BUT OUR COUNTRY IS NOT.

85
00:05:27,198 --> 00:05:30,255
IT'S LIKE I TELL MY KIDS EVERY
NIGHT.

86
00:05:30,255 --> 00:05:35,880
WE ARE STEEPED IN THE BLOOD OF
PATRIOTS IN A CASTLE MADE OF
BONES.

87
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:38,323
GOOD NIGHT, KIDS.

88
00:05:38,323 --> 00:05:43,695
AND SPEAKING OF TEA, MY TEA IS
READY.

89
00:05:52,428 --> 00:05:57,452
BUT TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WHO
ARE STRUGGLING RIGHT NOW,

90
00:05:57,452 --> 00:05:58,933
KNOW
THIS.

91
00:05:58,933 --> 00:06:01,359
WE HEAR YOU.

92
00:06:01,359 --> 00:06:04,015
WE SEE YOU.

93
00:06:04,015 --> 00:06:06,468
WE SMELL YOU.

94
00:06:06,468 --> 00:06:10,383
WE'RE INSIDE YOUR KITCHEN RIGHT NOW

95
00:06:10,383 --> 00:06:13,088
LOOKING THROUGH YOUR FRIDGE.

96
00:06:13,088 --> 00:06:15,618
AND WHAT'S THAT ON THE TOP
SHELF?

97
00:06:15,618 --> 00:06:18,261
MIGRANTS.

98
00:06:18,261 --> 00:06:21,808
I THINK THAT ANALOGY WENT WELL.

99
00:06:21,808 --> 00:06:26,375
IN CONCLUSION, TO THE PRESIDENT
OF THE UNITED STATES,

100
00:06:26,375 --> 00:06:29,797
I'LL JUST
SAY THIS, MR. BIDEN,

101
00:06:29,797 --> 00:06:33,816
THIS ISN'T
THE LAST YOU'LL SEE OF KATIE
BRITT.

102
00:06:33,816 --> 00:06:35,608
MAYBE NOT IN POLITICS,

103
00:06:35,608 --> 00:06:38,294
BUT WHEN YOU CLOSE YOUR EYES,

104
00:06:38,294 --> 00:06:41,764
I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.

105
00:06:41,764 --> 00:06:45,747
AND LIVE FROM NEW YORK, IT'S
SATURDAY NIGHT!

106
00:08:51,543 --> 00:08:56,569
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, JOSH
BROLIN!

107
00:09:13,411 --> 00:09:18,617
THANK

108
00:09:18,617 --> 00:09:20,786
I LOVE BEING HERE.

109
00:09:20,786 --> 00:09:24,176
YOU KNOW, IT'S BEEN 12 YEARS
SINCE I LAST HOSTED.

110
00:09:24,176 --> 00:09:26,087
AND I'VE MISSED THIS PLACE.

111
00:09:26,087 --> 00:09:29,020
I MEAN, SO MUCH HAS CHANGED.

112
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:31,871
NOT REALLY.
IT'S THE SAME.

113
00:09:31,871 --> 00:09:36,316
BUT THE BAND -- I MEAN, A COUPLE
GUYS, BUT IT'S ALL --

114
00:09:36,316 --> 00:09:39,304
ANYWAY, IT
ALL SEEMS DIFFERENT, BUT IT'S
THE SAME.

115
00:09:39,304 --> 00:09:42,686
THE FIRST TIME I HOSTED WAS IN 2008,

116
00:09:42,686 --> 00:09:48,095
MUSICAL GUEST WAS SOMEONE
I HAD NEVER HEARD OF BEFORE,
ADELE.

117
00:09:48,822 --> 00:09:50,884
NOW SHE'S A GLOBAL SUPERSTAR.

118
00:09:50,884 --> 00:09:55,413
THE SECOND TIME I HOSTED, THE
MUSICAL GUEST WAS GOTIER,

119
00:09:55,413 --> 00:09:59,086
AND
NOW HE'S JUST SOMEONE THAT I
USED TO KNOW.

120
00:09:59,086 --> 00:10:02,515
12 YEARS.
WHERE DOES IT GO?

121
00:10:02,515 --> 00:10:05,325
I MEAN, LOOK AT THE MILESTONES
THAT WE'VE EXPERIENCED.

122
00:10:05,325 --> 00:10:09,702
MARTHA STEWART AND SNOOP DOGG
RIPPING BONG HITS TOGETHER.

123
00:10:09,702 --> 00:10:15,913
CARDI B'S HIT SONG WET ASS
PASTRAMI.

124
00:10:15,913 --> 00:10:19,371
I WAS A PURPLE DUDE, THANOS WITH
A SCROTUM CHIN

125
00:10:19,371 --> 00:10:21,978
THAT SNAPPED ALL
THE POPULATION INTO DUST.

126
00:10:21,978 --> 00:10:25,174
IT'S BEEN A GOOD 12 YEARS.

127
00:10:27,053 --> 00:10:30,219
I'VE BEEN DIRECTING, I'VE BEEN
WRITING A LOT.

128
00:10:30,219 --> 00:10:35,062
I WROTE AN APPARENTLY SUPER
CREEPY POEM ABOUT TIMOTHEE
CHALAMET.

129
00:10:35,062 --> 00:10:38,732
I DON'T THINK IT'S CREEPY, BUT
YOU BE THE JUDGE.

130
00:10:38,732 --> 00:10:40,498
LIGHTS.

131
00:10:41,638 --> 00:10:45,220
YOUR FACE IS ETCHED BY
ADOLESCENCE.

132
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:47,703
YOUR CHEEKBONES JUT TOWARD

133
00:10:47,703 --> 00:10:52,270
WHAT ARE YOUTH EYES THAT SLIDE DOWN A
PROMINENT NOSE

134
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:56,517
AND ON TO LIPS OF
A CERTAIN POETRY.

135
00:10:56,517 --> 00:10:58,911
I MEAN, IT'S WEIRD, YEAH.
BUT I --

136
00:10:58,911 --> 00:11:00,583
NO, I DON'T WANT TO
SLEEP WITH HIM.

137
00:11:00,583 --> 00:11:03,866
BUT THAT'S WHAT I DO.
I WRITE POEMS ABOUT EVERYONE I
WORK WITH.

138
00:11:03,866 --> 00:11:08,121
LIKE THIS WEEK, I WROTE A POEM
ABOUT KENAN.

139
00:11:10,145 --> 00:11:12,314
>> WHAT'S THAT YOU SAY NOW?

140
00:11:12,314 --> 00:11:14,899
>> REMEMBER?
WE WERE REHEARSING,

141
00:11:14,899 --> 00:11:19,068
AND I WAS
LOOKING AT YOU, YOUR FACE, AND I
JUST GOT INSPIRED.

142
00:11:19,068 --> 00:11:20,703
LIGHTS.

143
00:11:21,435 --> 00:11:24,937
I LOOK AT YOU WITH YOUR AGELESS FACE

144
00:11:24,937 --> 00:11:29,920
AND SLIDE DOWN FURROWED
BROW UNTO SULTRY EYES.

145
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:33,490
THEN JUMPING OFF UNDER YOUR
SUGAR COOKIE CHEEKS

146
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:35,892
INTO THE
DIVETS OF YOUR LAUGH LINES

147
00:11:35,892 --> 00:11:39,263
AWAKENS IN ME A SYMPHONY OF DESIRE,

148
00:11:39,263 --> 00:11:43,920
TO WHICH I CAN ONLY
SAY -- WHAT UP WITH THAT?

149
00:11:47,504 --> 00:11:51,672
>> COOL, COOL, COOL, COOL, COOL,
COOL.

150
00:11:51,672 --> 00:11:52,880
>> LOVE YOU.

151
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:56,784
ANY WHO, I WRITE A LOT.
I MEAN HAVE A BOOK COMING OUT
LATER THIS YEAR

152
00:11:56,784 --> 00:11:58,996
CALLED "FROM
UNDER THE TRUCK."

153
00:12:00,877 --> 00:12:03,674
THAT WHOLE BOOK IS ABOUT KENAN.

154
00:12:03,674 --> 00:12:08,853
SO THIS IS MY THIRD TIME
HOSTING, AND, MAN, THERE'S JUST
NOTHING LIKE IT.

155
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:12,912
YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN DOING COLD
PLUNGES FOR 20 YEARS, RIGHT?

156
00:12:12,912 --> 00:12:16,907
AND THE ONLY THING I CAN COMPARE
THIS SHOW TO IS THAT.

157
00:12:16,907 --> 00:12:21,605
HOSTING IS LIKE JUMPING INTO AN
ICE BATH, YOU KNOW.

158
00:12:23,061 --> 00:12:27,854
SCARY, IT'S EXHILARATING,

159
00:12:27,854 --> 00:12:30,989
YOUR PENIS IS IN YOUR STOMACH.

160
00:12:30,989 --> 00:12:34,837
THERE'S JUST NO WAY TO PREPARE
FOR IT.

161
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:40,089
SO WHAT YOU GOT TO DO IS JUST
JUMP RIGHT IN.

162
00:12:41,076 --> 00:12:45,559
SURRENDER TO THE DISCOMFORT.

163
00:12:45,982 --> 00:12:48,303
YOU READY FOR THIS?

164
00:12:54,671 --> 00:12:58,608
I AM INEVITABLE!

165
00:12:58,608 --> 00:13:03,320
WE HAVE A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU
TONIGHT.
ARIANA GRANDE IS HERE,

166
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:06,660
SO STICK
AROUND.

167
00:13:29,866 --> 00:13:33,027
>>> WELL, CONGRATULATIONS, MS. POPLY,

168
00:13:33,027 --> 00:13:35,449
YOUR BUSINESS ACCOUNT
IS OFFICIALLY OPEN.

169
00:13:35,449 --> 00:13:38,815
>> THANK YOU SO MUCH, CHELSEA.
OH, THIS IS SO GREAT.

170
00:13:38,815 --> 00:13:40,444
>> SHE'S A BUSINESS OWNER.

171
00:13:40,444 --> 00:13:44,216
MEANWHILE, WE'RE MAKING CHECK
DEPOSITS LIKE IT'S 1995.

172
00:13:44,216 --> 00:13:45,976
>> BETTER SAFE THAN SORRY,
HON.

173
00:13:45,976 --> 00:13:47,631
LAST TIME WE TRIED E THE DEPOSITING

174
00:13:47,631 --> 00:13:51,744
I ACCIDENTALLY POSTED
BY SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER ON
ZILLOW.

175
00:13:52,009 --> 00:13:55,325
>> THIS IS A ROBBERY!

176
00:13:55,325 --> 00:13:57,182
>> WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO TO
US?

177
00:13:57,183 --> 00:14:02,269
HANDS

178
00:14:02,269 --> 00:14:05,386
>> SLIDE YOUR PHONES ACROSS THE
FLOOR.

179
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:07,481
>> MOVE.
COME ON!

180
00:14:07,481 --> 00:14:10,974
>> DON'T YOU DARE TOUCH ME.
DO NOT.

181
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:14,133
>> BE QUIET AND NO ONE GETS
HURT, OKAY?

182
00:14:14,133 --> 00:14:16,492
>> NO ONE GETS HURT?
YEAH RIGHT.

183
00:14:16,492 --> 00:14:19,792
I'VE SEEN ENOUGH MOVIES TO KNOW
WHAT HAPPENS TO A CHICK LIKE ME.

184
00:14:19,792 --> 00:14:23,696
TAKE ME TO THE VAULT AND GET IT
OVER WITH YOU NASTY BOYS.

185
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:25,903
>> WHAT?
LADY, SHUT UP.

186
00:14:25,903 --> 00:14:29,048
>> WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?
JUST WATCH?
>> WATCH WHAT?

187
00:14:29,048 --> 00:14:33,844
>> WATCH HELPLESS AS YOU HAVE
YOUR WAY WITH MY SUPPLE WIFE?

188
00:14:33,844 --> 00:14:36,347
>> THIS IS SO MESSED UP.

189
00:14:36,461 --> 00:14:38,832
>> AND WHO'S GOING TO FILM IT?

190
00:14:38,832 --> 00:14:40,604
>> FILM IT?

191
00:14:40,684 --> 00:14:43,964
>> I'M SO MAD I CAN'T SEE
STRAIGHT RIGHT NOW.

192
00:14:43,964 --> 00:14:46,947
>> SHUT UP!
NO ONE'S FILMING ANYTHING.

193
00:14:46,947 --> 00:14:49,808
>> WHO HERE IS THE BANK MANAGER?
>> I AM.
I'M THE MANAGER.

194
00:14:49,808 --> 00:14:54,107
>> ALL RIGHT, GLASSES.
WE'RE GOING TO GO TO THE VAULT
AND PUT IN THE COMBINATION.

195
00:14:54,108 --> 00:14:55,081
GOT

DISTRESS ALARM.

197
00:14:57,993 --> 00:15:02,355
>> DON'T TOUCH HIM.
TOUCH ME!

198
00:15:02,355 --> 00:15:06,059
HE PROBABLY HAS SOME FAMILY, AND
I'M JUST SOME CHICK.

199
00:15:06,059 --> 00:15:09,204
>> MOVE, LADY.
>> WHY ARE YOUR HANDS TIED UP?

200
00:15:09,204 --> 00:15:11,817
>> WE TIED OURSELVES

201
00:15:11,817 --> 00:15:15,304
BECAUSE WE DIDN'T WANT TO GIVE YOU SICKOS
THE SATISFACTION.

202
00:15:15,304 --> 00:15:19,600
YOU PROBABLY ARE GOING TO TAKE
MY CHICK IN THE BACK

203
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:23,327
AND LAY HER
ON A BED OF QUARTERS AND MAKE A
SMUT FILM IN THE VAULT.

204
00:15:23,327 --> 00:15:25,728
YOU MAKE ME SICK.

205
00:15:26,045 --> 00:15:31,152
WHAT'S THE NAME OF THE FILM?
ROBIN ROBIN OR STICKUP AT
ROBIN'S?

206
00:15:31,152 --> 00:15:34,438
>> HER NAME IS ROBIN, OKAY?

207
00:15:34,438 --> 00:15:39,762
>> YOU GUYS SHUT UP.
NO ONE WANTS TO OR IS GOING TO
DO ANYTHING WITH YOUR WIFE.

208
00:15:39,762 --> 00:15:42,298
>> OH, I GET IT.

209
00:15:42,298 --> 00:15:46,067
SO YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE YOUR WAY
WITH ME INSTEAD?

210
00:15:46,437 --> 00:15:50,253
YOU KNOW THIS, IF YOU TRY ANY

211
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:58,489
FUNNY BUSINESS, I WILL JUST

212

00:16:08,601 --> 00:16:11,069
WE JUST OPENED UP OUR MARRIAGE.

217
00:16:11,071 --> 00:16:12,537
>> AND WE WERE BOTH PRETTY

218

NERVOUS ABOUT OPENING THINGS UP,

219
00:16:14,441 --> 00:16:16,474
SO WE MADE A LOT OF RULES.

220
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:18,009
>> AND EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THE

221

>> I DO NOT WANT TO FILM IT.

243
00:16:56,316 --> 00:16:57,281

00:24:20,359 --> 00:24:20,658
SORRY.

482
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:21,926
I'M SUCH A BAD BOSS.

483
00:24:21,928 --> 00:24:23,360
YOU CAN HAVE MY JOB.

484
00:24:23,362 --> 00:24:25,196
>> NO, YOU'RE GREAT.

485
00:24:25,198 --> 00:24:27,398
I'M DOING BAD AS AN EMPLOYEE.

486
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:28,699
YOU SHOULD TOTALLY FIRE ME.

487
00:24:28,701 --> 00:24:29,567
>> YOU'RE DOING GREAT.

488
00:24:29,569 --> 00:24:30,401
I'M SO SORRY.

489
00:24:30,403 --> 00:24:30,968
>> I LOVE YOU.

490
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:32,303
>> I LOVE YOU TOO.

491
00:24:32,305 --> 00:24:34,672
>> I'M DUMB, YOU'RE SMART.

492
00:24:34,674 --> 00:24:35,840
>> WE ARE BOTH SMART AND STUPID.

493
00:24:35,842 --> 00:24:36,640
>> THAT'S IT.

494
00:24:36,642 --> 00:24:39,910
>> I'M THE COMPANY'S CEO, AND

495
00:24:39,912 --> 00:24:41,879
YOU'RE BOTH SO AMAZING, YOU

496
00:24:41,881 --> 00:24:42,947
SHOULD HAVE MY JOB.

497
00:24:42,949 --> 00:24:43,681
I DON'T DESERVE IT.

498
00:24:43,683 --> 00:24:44,682
I'M RESIGNING.

499
00:24:44,684 --> 00:24:45,516
>> STOP.

500
00:24:45,518 --> 00:24:46,450
WHAT HAPPENED THERE WAS BAD.

501
00:24:46,452 --> 00:24:48,185
IN THAT EXERCISE, EVERYONE LOST

502
00:24:48,187 --> 00:24:48,719
THEIR JOBS.

503
00:24:48,721 --> 00:24:51,121
>> WELL, I THINK THEY DID THEIR

504
00:24:51,123 --> 00:24:52,790
BEST.

505
00:24:52,792 --> 00:24:53,123
>> YEAH.

506
00:24:53,125 --> 00:24:54,592
AND I AGREE -- IF THAT'S OKAY

507
00:24:54,594 --> 00:24:54,992
WITH YOU.

508
00:24:54,994 --> 00:24:56,760
>> I THINK OUR WORK IS DONE

509
00:24:56,762 --> 00:24:57,061
HERE.

510
00:24:57,063 --> 00:24:59,163
LET'S ALL SAY THE PEOPLE

511
00:24:59,165 --> 00:25:02,900
PLEASERS PRAYER OF DEFERENCE.

512
00:25:02,902 --> 00:25:06,070
>> GOD, GRANT ME THE SERENITY TO

513
00:25:06,072 --> 00:25:08,906
SAY NO, BUT IF YOU'RE TOO BUSY

514
00:25:08,908 --> 00:25:13,077
WITH HEAVEN, THEN NO WORRIES.

515
00:25:13,079 --> 00:25:13,377
AMEN.

516
00:25:13,379 --> 00:25:20,484
OR A-MEN, WHATEVER YOU PREFER.

517
00:25:50,248 --> 00:25:54,518
I LIKE THAT ONE.

518
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:55,653
WHAT IS THAT?

519
00:25:55,655 --> 00:25:57,187
>> THAT'S THE CABERNET, AND THE

520
00:25:57,189 --> 00:25:59,356
BOOK SAYS TO PAIR THAT WITH THE

521
00:25:59,358 --> 00:26:01,258
AGED GOUDA.

522
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:02,359
>> MM.

523
00:26:02,361 --> 00:26:03,961
THAT'S GOOD.

524
00:26:03,963 --> 00:26:04,261
YEAH.

525
00:26:04,263 --> 00:26:06,196
>> GOSH, RICK AND MELISSA, THANK

526
00:26:06,198 --> 00:26:07,831

>> YEAH.

528
00:26:08,501 --> 00:26:10,100
I'VE NEVER BEEN TO A WINE AND

529
00:26:10,102 --> 00:26:10,701
CHEESE NIGHT BEFORE.

530
00:26:10,703 --> 00:26:12,870
>> WELL, WE HAVE A PASSION FOR

531
00:26:12,872 --> 00:26:15,406
WINE AND A PASSION FOR FINE

532
00:26:15,408 --> 00:26:15,739
CHEESE.

533
00:26:15,741 --> 00:26:17,508
WE'RE SO HAPPY TO GET TO SHARE

534
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:18,475

535
00:26:18,477 --> 00:26:21,111
>> OH, MY GOSH, BABE, LOOK WHO

536
00:26:21,113 --> 00:26:22,746
DECIDED TO JOIN US.

537
00:26:22,748 --> 00:26:24,682
TIGER, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

538
00:26:24,684 --> 00:26:27,751
>> AWW, SHE LOVES YOU.

539
00:26:27,753 --> 00:26:29,787
>> THE LITTLE GUY JUST WALKED

540
00:26:29,789 --> 00:26:32,690
RIGHT UP AND CURLED UP IN MY

541
00:26:32,692 --> 00:26:32,990
LAP.

542
00:26:32,992 --> 00:26:34,224
>> WELL, THAT IS SPECIAL.

543
00:26:34,226 --> 00:26:37,261
TIGER NEVER COMES OUT WHEN WE

544
00:26:37,263 --> 00:26:39,463
HAVE COMPANY, AND HE NEVER

545
00:26:39,465 --> 00:26:42,066
SNUGGLES UP TO ANYONE LIKE THAT.

546
00:26:42,068 --> 00:26:43,167
>> SERIOUSLY?

547
00:26:43,169 --> 00:26:45,636
>> NOT THAT I CAN REMEMBER.

548
00:26:45,638 --> 00:26:47,071
CHRIS, YOU MUST HAVE GOOD

549
00:26:47,073 --> 00:26:47,404
ENERGY.

550
00:26:47,406 --> 00:26:48,572
>> I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT.

551
00:26:48,574 --> 00:26:50,774
>> WELL, I HOPE YOU GUYS ARE

552
00:26:50,776 --> 00:26:53,477
READY FOR A TRIP TO ESPANIA

553
00:26:53,479 --> 00:26:59,016
BECAUSE UP NEXT WE HAVE A ROIJA.

554
00:26:59,018 --> 00:27:00,884
>> THE CAT NEVER DOES THIS?

555
00:27:00,886 --> 00:27:01,986
>> NOT REALLY.

556
00:27:01,988 --> 00:27:04,088
LIKE MELISSA SAID, YOU MUST HAVE

557
00:27:04,090 --> 00:27:04,521
GOOD ENERGY.

558
00:27:04,523 --> 00:27:07,024
>> I HOPE SO.

559
00:27:07,026 --> 00:27:09,793
I MEAN, THE CAT CHOSE ME, RIGHT?

560
00:27:09,795 --> 00:27:10,894
MUST BE BECAUSE OF MY ENERGY.

561
00:27:10,896 --> 00:27:11,328
>> YEAH.

562
00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:14,298
>> SO, GUYS FOR THE RIOJA,

563
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:15,899

>> CAT COULD'VE CHOSE ANYONE.

567
00:27:21,173 --> 00:27:24,074
BUT HE CHOSE ME, SO I GUESS I

568
00:27:24,076 --> 00:27:24,641

569
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:26,910
>> YEAH, CHRIS, ARE YOU OKAY,

570
00:27:26,912 --> 00:27:27,411
MAN?

571
00:27:27,413 --> 00:27:29,146
SEEMS LIKE THIS CAT THING IS

572
00:27:29,148 --> 00:27:29,913
REALLY SIGNIFICANT TO YOU.

573
00:27:29,915 --> 00:27:31,148
>> WELL, IT IS.

574
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:33,117
I WORRY I DON'T HAVE GOOD

575

THAT'S AWESOME.

578
00:27:37,523 --> 00:27:38,655
>> IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

579
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:40,657
ANYTHING GOING ON AT WORK OR?

580
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:43,794
>> NO, JUST SAME OLD, SAME OLD,

581
00:27:43,796 --> 00:27:45,863
CLOSING DOWN NURSING HOMES AND

582
00:27:45,865 --> 00:27:49,700
TURNING THEM INTO TOP GOLFS.

583
00:27:49,702 --> 00:27:50,868
SAME AS IT EVER WAS.

584
00:27:50,870 --> 00:27:53,003
>> GOD, I FORGET THAT'S WHAT YOU

585
00:27:53,005 --> 00:27:53,270
DO.

586
00:27:53,272 --> 00:27:54,438

00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:55,572
THE OLD FOLKS AFTER YOU SHUT

588

>> I DON'T KNOW.

590
00:27:58,444 --> 00:28:00,511
PROBABLY SLEEP IN THE STREET.

591
00:28:00,513 --> 00:28:01,812
I'M SORRY.

592
00:28:01,814 --> 00:28:03,747
SO YOU'RE SAYING HE NEVER DOES

00:28:32,845 --> 00:28:33,677
BIG DAMN SLUT?

610

650
00:29:39,245 --> 00:29:41,545
>> RICK, LOOK, TIGER'S BACK WITH

651
00:29:41,547 --> 00:29:41,879
CHRIS.

652
00:29:41,881 --> 00:29:42,446
>> YEAH.

653
00:29:42,448 --> 00:29:43,914
LITTLE GUY JUST CRAWLED UP AND

654
00:29:43,916 --> 00:29:45,482
CURLED UP IN MY LAP.

655
00:29:45,484 --> 00:29:49,019
>> HE GRABBED HIM OFF MY LAP,

656
00:29:49,021 --> 00:29:52,222
AND TIGER BIT HIS ARM.

657
00:29:52,224 --> 00:29:52,589
>> LIAR.

658
00:29:52,591 --> 00:29:53,590
>> CHRIS, YOU'RE BLEEDING A LOT.

659
00:29:53,592 --> 00:29:55,259
YOU SHOULD GO TO A HOSPITAL.

660
00:29:55,261 --> 00:29:55,826
>> NEVER.

661
00:29:55,828 --> 00:29:57,027
I'LL DIE HERE.

662
00:29:57,029 --> 00:29:58,562
I'LL DIE HERE HAPPY, AND IF YOU

663
00:29:58,564 --> 00:30:00,731
GOT A PROBLEM WITH THAT, THEN

664
00:30:00,733 --> 00:30:03,400
I'LL JUST TAKE YOU OUT WITH ME.

665
00:30:03,402 --> 00:30:03,800
>> GO AHEAD.

666
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:04,638
MAKE MY DAY!

667
00:30:06,639 --> 00:30:10,925
VIENNA

668
00:30:13,439 --> 00:30:16,397
OUTDONE YOURSELF THIS TIME.

669
00:30:16,397 --> 00:30:19,912
>> YES, THIS IS TRULY QUITE THE
AFFAIR.
>> GENTLEMEN, YOU FLATTER ME.

670
00:30:19,912 --> 00:30:22,535
>> THE ARCH DUCHESS WILL BE HERE
SHORTLY.

671
00:30:22,535 --> 00:30:27,646
MAY I REMIND YOU THAT A MARRIAGE
WOULD NOT ONLY INCREASE YOUR RANK

672
00:30:27,646 --> 00:30:31,074
BUT STABILIZE THE FAMILY
FOR YEARS TO COME.

673
00:30:31,074 --> 00:30:33,743
>> YES, BUT I HEAR SHE'S A
DIFFICULT WOMAN TO IMPRESS.

674
00:30:33,743 --> 00:30:37,545
>> INDEED, SHE'S SEEN MANY OF
THE WORLD'S GREAT SPLENDORS, 

675
00:30:37,545 --> 00:30:42,605
BUT
SHE HAS NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE
THIS.

676
00:30:43,692 --> 00:30:48,567
>> WHAT IS IT, KINSKY?
>> I CALL IT THE SHRIMP TOWER.

677
00:30:48,567 --> 00:30:51,804
I JUST THOUGHT OF IT LAST NIGHT.

678
00:30:51,804 --> 00:30:53,978
>> I DO FEEL I'VE SEEN SHRIMP AT
A PARTY BEFORE.

679
00:30:53,978 --> 00:30:58,087
I DON'T THINK SO

680
00:30:58,087 --> 00:31:03,159
AND IT'S ALL SHRIMP?
>> INDEED, FROM TOP TO BOTTOM,
NOTHING BUT SHRIMP.

681
00:31:03,159 --> 00:31:06,230
SHRIMP, SHRIMP, SHRIMP, OR AS I
LIKE TO CALL THEM, 

682
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:08,534
THE SINKING
MAN'S MOZZARELLA SHRIMP.

683
00:31:08,633 --> 00:31:10,753
QUITE

684
00:31:10,753 --> 00:31:14,243
>> I CAN'T HELP BUT NOTICE IT
DOES SEMIPRECARIOUSLY PLACED.

685
00:31:14,243 --> 00:31:16,326
>> THAT'S PART OF ITS CHARM.

686
00:31:16,326 --> 00:31:19,581
IF ANYTHING WERE TO HAPPEN TO MY
SHRIMP TOWER,

687
00:31:19,667 --> 00:31:22,242
 I WOULD OBVIOUSLY
KILL MYSELF.

688
00:31:23,267 --> 00:31:25,718
>> WAIT.
SHE'S HERE.

689
00:31:25,718 --> 00:31:30,231
>> THE ARCH DUCHESS,
KLAUSTENBERG.

690
00:31:31,586 --> 00:31:34,340
>> MY GOD, SHE'S BEAUTIFUL.

691
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:37,932
>> COUNT KINSKY, THANK YOU FOR
INVITING ME TO YOUR PALACE.

692
00:31:37,932 --> 00:31:40,661
I MUST SAY, IT FEELS LIKE HOME,

693
00:31:40,661 --> 00:31:43,883
AND PERHAPS ONE DAY, IT WILL BE.

694
00:31:46,022 --> 00:31:49,189
>> I THINK THE SHRIMP TOWER IS
WORKING.

695
00:31:49,189 --> 00:31:53,426
>> I MEAN, I SUPPOSE SO.

696
00:32:14,155 --> 00:32:17,261
>> OH, LOOK, HE'S GOING TO DANCE
WITH HER.

697
00:32:19,545 --> 00:32:23,404
>> KINSKY!
WHY DID YOU DO THAT?

698
00:32:23,404 --> 00:32:26,350
>> WHAT?
I THOUGHT SHE WAS GOING TO KNOCK
OVER THE SHRIMP TOWER.

699
00:32:26,350 --> 00:32:29,882
>> GOOD GOD, MAN, WHAT WERE YOU
THINKING?
>> SO I'M INSANE.

700
00:32:29,882 --> 00:32:33,460
I'M THE ONLY ONE WHO THOUGHT SHE
WAS GOING TO KNOCK OVER THE
SHRIMP TOWER.

701
00:32:33,556 --> 00:32:38,563
SHOW OF HANDS, WHO ELSE THOUGHT
SHE WAS GOING TO KNOCK OVER THE
SHRIMP TOWER?

702
00:32:38,729 --> 00:32:40,713
ONE PERSON, THANK YOU.

703
00:32:40,791 --> 00:32:43,485
>> BUT KINSKY, YOU KILLED THE
POOR GIRL.

704
00:32:43,485 --> 00:32:48,617
>> OH, GOD.
PERHAPS I OVERREACTED IN THE
HEAT OF THE MOMENT.

705
00:32:48,617 --> 00:32:49,865
WHAT HAVE I DONE?

706
00:32:49,865 --> 00:32:51,466
>> I'M OKAY.

707
00:32:51,466 --> 00:32:56,632
I WASN'T EVEN TRYING TO KNOCK
OVER THE SHRIMP TOWER.

708
00:32:56,632 --> 00:32:59,106
>> KNOCK OVER THE SHRIMP TOWER?

709
00:33:00,398 --> 00:33:02,464
>> KINSKY, YOU'VE DONE IT AGAIN.

710
00:33:02,464 --> 00:33:05,543
>> LOOK, WE ALL AGREE THAT THE
NIGHT HAD TO BE SPECIAL, 

711
00:33:05,621 --> 00:33:09,532
AND THE
THING THAT MADE THE NIGHT
SPECIAL WAS THE SHRIMP TOWER.

712
00:33:09,532 --> 00:33:13,005
WE MUST PROTECT THE SHRIMP TOWER
AT ALL COSTS.

713
00:33:13,005 --> 00:33:18,034
YOU ARE PROFESSOR OF LOGIC, DO
YOU DETECT ANY ERROR IN MY
THINKING?

714
00:33:18,034 --> 00:33:20,498
>> THE MAN'S LOGIC IS SOUND.

715
00:33:20,498 --> 00:33:24,162
>> WELL, IF HE SAYS HE'S RIGHT.
>> THAT IS ALL I'M SAYING.

716
00:33:24,162 --> 00:33:28,262
NOW, COULD I HAVE PERHAPS
HANDLED IT BETTER?
SURE.

717
00:33:28,637 --> 00:33:30,213
BUT I'M HUMAN.

718
00:33:30,213 --> 00:33:33,455
WHICH IS UNFORTUNATE BECAUSE I
WISH I WERE A SHRIMP.

719
00:33:33,455 --> 00:33:36,270
>> GOOD HEAVENS, MAN, YOU'VE GOT
SHRIMP ON THE BRAIN!

720
00:33:36,270 --> 00:33:41,194
>> KINSKY, I HAVE SOMETHING I
WANT TO SAY!

721
00:33:43,151 --> 00:33:47,770
I'VE SEEN THE WAY YOU
PASSIONATELY PROTECT THE THINGS YOU LOVE, 

722
00:33:47,770 --> 00:33:51,696
AND IF YOU CAN LOVE ME
AS MUCH AS YOU LOVE THAT SHRIMP TOWER, 

723
00:33:51,696 --> 00:33:56,706
WELL, THEN I WOULD BE THE
LUCKIEST GIRL IN EUROPE.

724
00:33:56,706 --> 00:34:00,528
>> WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE KINSKY
HAS FOUND A BRIDE.

725
00:34:00,528 --> 00:34:04,704
AND NOW LET US CELEBRATE BY
EATING THE SHRIMP.

726
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:11,438
>> YOU EAT IT BY THE TAIL?

727
00:34:11,438 --> 00:34:14,686
>> HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO EAT IT?
BY THE HEAD?

728
00:34:17,008 --> 00:34:20,305
>> KINSKY, ARE YOU OKAY?

729
00:34:20,305 --> 00:34:24,631
>> YEAH.
YOU KNOW, IN A WAY, I'M
RELIEVED.

730
00:34:24,631 --> 00:34:26,883
ACTUALLY KIND OF LIBERATING, YOU
KNOW?

731
00:34:26,883 --> 00:34:29,722
>> THAT'S GOOD.
>> YEAH.

732
00:34:30,145 --> 00:34:34,257
>> WELL, I MUST SAY THE NIGHT
WAS A COMPLETE SUCCESS.

733
00:34:34,257 --> 00:34:38,286
>> INDEED.
TO KINSKY, THE HAPPIEST MAN IN
THE WORLD.

734
00:34:38,286 --> 00:34:41,463
>> TO KINSKY!

735
00:34:57,795 --> 00:35:05,035
OUR TOPIC TODAY IS HE CHEAT OR

736
00:35:05,037 --> 00:35:05,302
NAH?

737
00:35:05,304 --> 00:35:08,338
PLEASE WELCOME JASMINE WHO SAYS

738
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:09,406
SHE'S FED UP WITH HER HUSBAND

739
00:35:09,408 --> 00:35:11,241
JERRY AND SUSPECTS HE MAY BE

740
00:35:11,243 --> 00:35:12,108
STEPPING OUT.

741
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:14,845
SO TELL US WHAT'S GOING ON,

742
00:35:14,847 --> 00:35:15,212
JASMINE.

743
00:35:15,214 --> 00:35:16,213
>> HEY, SHONDA.

744
00:35:16,215 --> 00:35:17,781
I'M JUST FED UP, GIRL.

745
00:35:17,783 --> 00:35:19,216
I DO EVERYTHING FOR THIS MAN.

746
00:35:19,218 --> 00:35:21,518
I COOK FOR HIM, I CLEAN, I TAKE

747
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,119
CARE OF THE KIDS.

748
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:25,889
I EVEN WASH HIS FUNKY DIRTY

749
00:35:25,891 --> 00:35:26,256
DRAWERS.

750
00:35:26,258 --> 00:35:30,360
>> GIRL, HE SOUNDS LIKE A D-O-G,

751
00:35:30,362 --> 00:35:32,462
GOING DOG, DUMP HIS ASS.

752
00:35:32,464 --> 00:35:33,897
>> SO YOU'RE SAYING HE DOESN'T

753
00:35:33,899 --> 00:35:35,265
APPRECIATE YOU, JASMINE?

754
00:35:35,267 --> 00:35:36,233
>> NOT AT ALL.

755
00:35:36,235 --> 00:35:37,968
ALL HE DOES IS SIT IN FRONT OF

756
00:35:37,970 --> 00:35:41,738
THE TV LIKE A DANG ZOMBIE.

757
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:44,374
>> I JUST WANT TO SAY, YOU ARE

758
00:35:44,376 --> 00:35:44,741
BEAUTIFUL.

759
00:35:44,743 --> 00:35:46,810
AND IF YOU WAS MY LADY, WE

760
00:35:46,812 --> 00:35:50,547
WOULDN'T NEED NO TV.

761
00:35:50,549 --> 00:35:52,048
>> THANK YOU.

762
00:35:52,050 --> 00:35:53,250
THERE ARE STILL GENTLEMEN.

763
00:35:53,252 --> 00:35:55,719
>> ALL RIGHT.

764
00:35:55,721 --> 00:35:58,054
SO JASMINE, WHY ARE YOU STILL

765
00:35:58,056 --> 00:35:58,889
WITH THIS BUM?

766
00:35:58,891 --> 00:36:00,457
>> BECAUSE HE WASN'T ALWAYS LIKE

767
00:36:00,459 --> 00:36:01,124
THIS, SHONDA.

768
00:36:01,126 --> 00:36:03,627
HE USED TO TAKE MY DANCING,

769
00:36:03,629 --> 00:36:07,664
HIKING, AND WE HAD SEX ALL THE

770
00:36:07,666 --> 00:36:07,964
TIME.

771
00:36:07,966 --> 00:36:08,932
>> OKAY, OKAY.

772
00:36:08,934 --> 00:36:09,733
WHAT ABOUT NOW?

773
00:36:09,735 --> 00:36:11,701
>> NOW HE'S ALWAYS TIRED, AND HE

774
00:36:11,703 --> 00:36:13,403
DOESN'T EVEN DO ANYTHING, SO HE

775
00:36:13,405 --> 00:36:14,137
MUST BE GETTING IT FROM SOMEBODY

776
00:36:14,139 --> 00:36:16,806
ELSE.

777
00:36:16,808 --> 00:36:18,542
>> AND WHAT DO YOU WANT TO SAY,

778
00:36:18,544 --> 00:36:18,842
MA'AM?

779
00:36:18,844 --> 00:36:20,710
>> HONEY, THERE IS NO EXCUSE.

780
00:36:20,712 --> 00:36:22,245
THAT MAN IS NO GOOD, AND YOU

781
00:36:22,247 --> 00:36:26,783
NEED TO DUMP HIS ASS QUICK.

782
00:36:26,785 --> 00:36:28,985
>> WELL, GIRL, YOU KNOW OUR

783
00:36:28,987 --> 00:36:30,120
AUDIENCE IS ALWAYS GOING TO TELL

784
00:36:30,122 --> 00:36:31,421
IT LIKE IT IS.

785
00:36:31,423 --> 00:36:33,223
SO WHAT DO YOU HOPE TO FIND OUT

786
00:36:33,225 --> 00:36:33,523
TODAY?

787
00:36:33,525 --> 00:36:34,758
>> SHONDA, I DO EVERYTHING FOR

788
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:36,593
THIS MAN, AND HE GIVES ME

789
00:36:36,595 --> 00:36:38,361
NOTHING, SO I JUST WANT TO KNOW

790
00:36:38,363 --> 00:36:41,031
IS HE CHEATING OR NAH.

791
00:36:41,033 --> 00:36:43,433
>> WELL, LET'S BRING THAT DIRTY

792
00:36:43,435 --> 00:36:44,100
CHEATER OUT.

793
00:36:44,102 --> 00:36:44,668
>> ALL RIGHT.

794
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:46,269
LET'S GO AHEAD AND BRING OUT

795
00:36:46,271 --> 00:36:46,570
JERRY.

796
00:36:46,572 --> 00:36:58,748
>> BOO!

797
00:36:58,750 --> 00:36:59,082
>> BOO.

798
00:36:59,084 --> 00:37:01,718
>> NOPE.

799
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:04,854
I AIN'T FOOLING WITH THIS.

800
00:37:04,856 --> 00:37:06,189
>> OKAY.

801
00:37:06,191 --> 00:37:09,159
SO, JERRY, JASMINE SAYS YOU TWO

802
00:37:09,161 --> 00:37:10,493
ARE NOT INTIMATE ANYMORE.

803
00:37:10,495 --> 00:37:12,462
>> SHE BROKE MY DAMN NECK.

804
00:37:12,464 --> 00:37:13,063
>> RIGHT.

805
00:37:13,065 --> 00:37:15,865
AND YOU KNOW WHAT, THAT'S REALLY

806
00:37:15,867 --> 00:37:16,733
COOL, YEAH.

807
00:37:16,735 --> 00:37:17,601

WHEN IT'S ALL SAID AND DONE,

1540
01:07:25,959 --> 01:07:29,260
LISA ONLY HEARS WHAT SHE WANTED

1541
01:07:29,262 --> 01:07:29,627
TO HEAR.

1542
