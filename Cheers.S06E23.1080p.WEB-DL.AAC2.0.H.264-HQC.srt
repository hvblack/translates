1
00:00:03,111 --> 00:00:06,413
<i>Cheers is filmed
before a live studio audience.</i>

2
00:00:06,413 --> 00:00:09,386
Carla, you look spiffy.
You going out tonight?

3
00:00:09,386 --> 00:00:12,698
Yeah, Eddie
and I are catching a movie.
This is his last night in town.

4
00:00:12,732 --> 00:00:15,515
He's going out on the road again
with the ice show.

5
00:00:15,847 --> 00:00:18,687
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Oh, nothing.

6
00:00:18,721 --> 00:00:21,386
Well, you know,
I get this image of, you know,

7
00:00:21,386 --> 00:00:24,793
chorus girls in skimpy costumes,
you know, skating around,

8
00:00:24,827 --> 00:00:27,278
lonely husband on the road,
far away

9
00:00:27,278 --> 00:00:31,244
from his, uh,
connubial connubials,
if you know what I mean.

10
00:00:31,244 --> 00:00:35,113
- Well, y-you're not worried?
- Not at all.

11
00:00:35,113 --> 00:00:38,340
I know my Eddie,
and I trust him completely.

12
00:00:38,375 --> 00:00:42,280
He is the sweetest,
most faithful, loving husband in
the whole world,

13
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:44,727
and I
thank God every day
he married me.

14
00:00:44,727 --> 00:00:48,150
If ever there
was a one-woman man,
it's Eddie LeBec.

15
00:00:48,185 --> 00:00:52,109
- Hey, Carla,
what movie you going to see?
- Fatal Attraction.

16
00:00:59,562 --> 00:01:02,130
¶ Making your way
in the world today ¶

17
00:01:02,165 --> 00:01:05,133
¶ Takes everything you've got.

18
00:01:05,168 --> 00:01:07,969
¶ Taking a break
from all your worries ¶

19
00:01:08,004 --> 00:01:11,072
¶ Sure would help a lot.

20
00:01:11,107 --> 00:01:15,475
¶ Wouldn't you like
to get away? ¶

21
00:01:16,846 --> 00:01:19,348
¶ Sometimes you want to go.

22
00:01:19,383 --> 00:01:23,460
¶ Where everybody
knows your name ¶

23
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:28,958
¶ And they're always glad
you came ¶

24
00:01:29,192 --> 00:01:31,658
¶ You want to be
where you can see ¶

25
00:01:31,658 --> 00:01:34,313
¶ Our troubles
are all the same ¶

26
00:01:34,347 --> 00:01:39,160
¶ You want to be where everybody
knows your name ¶

27
00:01:39,545 --> 00:01:42,221
¶ You want to go
where people know ¶

28
00:01:42,255 --> 00:01:44,418
¶ People are all the same.

29
00:01:44,418 --> 00:01:49,708
¶ You want to go where
everybody knows your name. ¶

30
00:02:09,933 --> 00:02:11,533
Good evening, everyone.

31
00:02:11,567 --> 00:02:15,767
You'll be glad to know
I decided to take your advice
and become more dynamic.

32
00:02:15,767 --> 00:02:19,057
I have just left a seminar
that has changed my life.

33
00:02:19,092 --> 00:02:23,495
In a few short hours,
I have become the essence
of self assertiveness.

34
00:02:23,529 --> 00:02:29,200
Five.
Four,
three, two, one!

35
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:34,840
What's going on here?
What's going on?

36
00:02:34,875 --> 00:02:37,959
Hey, I run this place.
What's happening?

37
00:02:43,016 --> 00:02:47,351
If somebody doesn't tell me
what's going on,
I am gonna start crying.

38
00:02:47,351 --> 00:02:49,956
Aw,
we're sorry. Uh, we didn't know
you were here.

39
00:02:49,956 --> 00:02:51,840
Today is our anniversary.

40
00:02:51,875 --> 00:02:53,264
This is the day, two years ago

41
00:02:53,264 --> 00:02:58,121
where Cheers beat
that scourge down the road,
Gary's Old Town Tavern,
in bowling!

42
00:02:58,849 --> 00:03:02,811
- That's-That's the big deal?
- It's the only time
we ever won anything.

43
00:03:02,819 --> 00:03:04,432
I take it that they've
beaten us at things.

44
00:03:04,432 --> 00:03:07,656
At everything.
Touch football, softball, darts,

45
00:03:07,656 --> 00:03:09,991
ugliest toes, you name it...

46
00:03:10,026 --> 00:03:12,942
I think the current
tally is 173 to one,

47
00:03:12,942 --> 00:03:15,982
but we are presently
on a winning streak.

48
00:03:16,932 --> 00:03:18,333
We're number one!

49
00:03:18,333 --> 00:03:23,023
We're number one!
We're number one!

50
00:03:23,023 --> 00:03:28,916
Sammy! Sammy!
Isn't it about time
for the call?

51
00:03:28,916 --> 00:03:33,124
- By golly, yes, it is.
- Time to give him a call?

52
00:03:33,366 --> 00:03:35,467
Hear ye, hear ye.

53
00:03:35,502 --> 00:03:38,716
It's time
for the ceremonial call
to Gary's!

54
00:03:38,716 --> 00:03:41,828
The call!
The call...!

55
00:03:46,896 --> 00:03:50,298
Hello, Gary.
It's Sam Malone.

56
00:03:50,333 --> 00:03:53,324
Yeah, I was just calling
to say hi, see how you're doing.

57
00:03:53,324 --> 00:03:58,141
No. You know,
for the life of me,
I-I can't think
of what brought you to mind.

58
00:03:58,141 --> 00:04:02,978
No, wait a minute, may...
Maybe it was because
two years ago tonight,

59
00:04:03,012 --> 00:04:06,519
we waxed your heinie in bowling!

60
00:04:08,217 --> 00:04:09,802
No, no. Oh...

61
00:04:09,836 --> 00:04:13,355
- The poor sap is begging
for a rematch.
- No. No, no.

62
00:04:13,389 --> 00:04:16,592
I'm sorry, Gary, no.
No, there'll be no rematch.

63
00:04:16,626 --> 00:04:20,579
The moment of victory
is frozen in time.

64
00:04:20,613 --> 00:04:24,248
That's right. Gar...
Hello? Gary?

65
00:04:24,667 --> 00:04:27,436
The guy is such a poor loser.

66
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:29,656
Drinks on the house!

67
00:04:29,656 --> 00:04:33,318
Carla, Carla,
once more around
the bar, huh? Huh?

68
00:04:34,127 --> 00:04:35,765
We're number one!

69
00:04:35,765 --> 00:04:37,929
Hold it. Hold it!

70
00:04:37,964 --> 00:04:41,326
Where is the trophy?
Who moved it?

71
00:04:42,001 --> 00:04:45,354
Oh, come on.
It's got to be around
here somewhere.

72
00:04:45,388 --> 00:04:48,674
Hey, now listen,
this is not funny.
Where is the trophy?

73
00:04:48,708 --> 00:04:51,894
Wa-hay-hay
hait a minute.

74
00:04:51,928 --> 00:04:55,480
- This smacks of Gary.
- Hey, you mean
he had a spy in here?

75
00:04:55,515 --> 00:04:58,706
Yeah, hey, that's right.
Who was that guy
at the end of the bar
drinking imported beer?

76
00:04:58,706 --> 00:05:02,270
Mm-hmm. Very suspicious.
You know none of us
can afford that stuff.

77
00:05:02,305 --> 00:05:04,694
Let's storm the place!

78
00:05:05,275 --> 00:05:09,511
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.
Come on, let's not turn this
into mob rule here.

79
00:05:09,545 --> 00:05:12,214
Just a couple of guys go over
and talk to him first. Come on.

80
00:05:12,248 --> 00:05:14,601
All right, Sam, I think
you better take me
because, uh,

81
00:05:14,601 --> 00:05:18,182
 they got
to be intimidated
by the authority of my uniform.

82
00:05:18,666 --> 00:05:21,347
Actually, I think
I'll take Woody.

83
00:05:21,414 --> 00:05:24,376
You know, in case
there's some trouble,
I'd like to have someone
young and strong around.

84
00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:26,037
Come on, Woody.

85
00:05:38,074 --> 00:05:40,038
Good luck.

86
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:52,171
Our trophy!

87
00:05:52,205 --> 00:05:54,697
Oh,
Sam!

88
00:05:54,697 --> 00:05:57,759
What did you do to Gary?
Did you punch him
right in the face?

89
00:05:57,794 --> 00:05:59,709
Uh, n-not exactly, no.

90
00:05:59,709 --> 00:06:02,178
- He did ask out a waitress.
- Hey.

91
00:06:02,178 --> 00:06:04,052
Sam.

92
00:06:04,052 --> 00:06:09,467
Hey.
What are you all
sitting around here
like a bunch of wimps for?

93
00:06:09,467 --> 00:06:12,510
It's what wimps do.

94
00:06:16,412 --> 00:06:19,328
Let's go over to Gary's
and torch the place! Come on!

95
00:06:19,328 --> 00:06:23,135
Oh, no, no, come on, whoa, whoa.
There's got to be a cooler
way of doing this now.

96
00:06:23,169 --> 00:06:25,098
We got to use a little cunning.

97
00:06:25,098 --> 00:06:29,724
Yeah.
Yeah, I'd like
to do something to Gary
and make him really miserable.

98
00:06:29,758 --> 00:06:32,027
Why don't you marry him?

99
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:36,799
Why don't you?
Why don't you? Why don't you?

100
00:06:36,833 --> 00:06:38,517
You! You!
You! You!

101
00:06:38,551 --> 00:06:40,161
That's it!

102
00:06:40,161 --> 00:06:43,004
I do not want this thing
getting out of hand.

103
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:46,094
If this bar becomes
a high school locker room,
my patronage,

104
00:06:46,094 --> 00:06:49,011
other than the Bowery Boys,
will disappear.

105
00:06:49,045 --> 00:06:52,129
No, in this case,
I'm afraid
I must agree with Rebecca.

106
00:06:52,129 --> 00:06:53,899
Thank you, Dr. Crane.

107
00:06:53,933 --> 00:06:56,367
Well, it's-it's not
for your dollar-grubbing,

108
00:06:56,402 --> 00:06:59,206
you know, front office,
kissy face reasons, but...

109
00:07:00,356 --> 00:07:03,476
...it's because
revenge is never the answer.

110
00:07:03,476 --> 00:07:07,027
You see,
a potentially unending cycle of

111
00:07:07,027 --> 00:07:10,182
juvenile retaliation
can only lead to a...

112
00:07:10,216 --> 00:07:12,584
well, a kind of mob mentality,

113
00:07:12,619 --> 00:07:16,021
which will ultimately result
in a regrettable act.

114
00:07:16,055 --> 00:07:19,191
Wait a minute, Doc.
When Diane left you
at the altar,

115
00:07:19,225 --> 00:07:24,062
aren't you the guy
who enrolled her
in every tape, book,
and record club
known to mankind?

116
00:07:24,814 --> 00:07:26,524
Yes, but that was different.

117
00:07:26,549 --> 00:07:28,369
The pompous witch deserved it.

118
00:07:28,369 --> 00:07:30,957
No,
no, no, no, come on.

119
00:07:30,957 --> 00:07:34,269
We got to think of something
to get our pride back.

120
00:07:34,269 --> 00:07:35,507
Like what Sammy, huh? Well...

121
00:07:35,541 --> 00:07:39,160
There is one thing
you can beat
Gary's Old Town Tavern at.

122
00:07:39,195 --> 00:07:42,395
- Oh, yeah? What's that?
- Maturity.

123
00:08:03,219 --> 00:08:04,469
It's Al.

124
00:08:04,469 --> 00:08:07,756
Hey, Al, why aren't
you at Cheers?

125
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:10,559
Holy mackerel,
this isn't Cheers?

126
00:08:12,778 --> 00:08:15,129
Uh-oh, Malone's back.

127
00:08:15,164 --> 00:08:16,415
And this time,

128
00:08:16,449 --> 00:08:18,283
he brought some muscle.

129
00:08:18,318 --> 00:08:21,036
Ooh!

130
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:22,738
Sammy, I-I can't go
through with this,

131
00:08:22,772 --> 00:08:24,640
not when this guy's
taking shots at me.

132
00:08:24,674 --> 00:08:26,141
No, no, that was a shot at me.

133
00:08:26,175 --> 00:08:27,375
You're right.

134
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:28,710
Yeah. Okay.

135
00:08:28,745 --> 00:08:30,445
Gary? Mm-hmm.

136
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:31,980
We're here in peace.

137
00:08:32,014 --> 00:08:34,366
Now we want
to let bygones be bygones,

138
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,151
so we brought along
some champagne

139
00:08:36,185 --> 00:08:37,519
to bury the hatchet.

140
00:08:37,554 --> 00:08:39,220
What do you say, huh?

141
00:08:39,255 --> 00:08:40,321
Is that right?

142
00:08:40,355 --> 00:08:41,723
No tricks?

143
00:08:41,757 --> 00:08:43,091
No tricks.

144
00:08:43,125 --> 00:08:45,393
Wow, that's damn decent
of you, Malone.

145
00:08:45,428 --> 00:08:46,695
Milt, some glasses.

146
00:08:46,729 --> 00:08:48,196
I'll be honest with you.

147
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:49,731
I mean, last night at Cheers,

148
00:08:49,766 --> 00:08:51,800
all we could talk
about was revenge.

149
00:08:51,834 --> 00:08:53,935
That trophy meant
a great deal to us.

150
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:55,304
But then, you
know, cooler heads,

151
00:08:55,338 --> 00:08:56,905
light of day and all
that kind of thing,

152
00:08:56,939 --> 00:08:59,240
we just... well, we realized

153
00:08:59,275 --> 00:09:00,575
that to do battle with you

154
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:02,644
would just destroy both of us.

155
00:09:02,678 --> 00:09:05,079
At least we have
the satisfaction of knowing

156
00:09:05,114 --> 00:09:08,016
that we, uh, we beat you
in one thing.

157
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:09,684
Maturity.

158
00:09:09,719 --> 00:09:12,553
Oh, actually, I'm afraid
you came up short there, too.

159
00:09:12,588 --> 00:09:14,656
I just sent a dozen roses
over to Cheers

160
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:15,924
with an apology note.

161
00:09:15,958 --> 00:09:18,159
Oh. Oh, well.

162
00:09:18,193 --> 00:09:19,828
Here's to Cheers.

163
00:09:19,862 --> 00:09:20,978
No, no, no.

164
00:09:21,013 --> 00:09:22,097
To Gary's.

165
00:09:22,131 --> 00:09:24,733
Yeah, to Gary's! Yeah!

166
00:09:35,528 --> 00:09:37,379
Whoo! Gary, Gary, I think maybe

167
00:09:37,413 --> 00:09:40,282
you ought to keep that
back window locked.

168
00:09:40,316 --> 00:09:42,684
You know, people could sneak
in here and steal some of this

169
00:09:42,718 --> 00:09:43,602
fine crystal.

170
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:46,254
Come, my little

171
00:09:46,288 --> 00:09:48,173
vandal, our job here is done.

172
00:09:48,207 --> 00:09:50,392
You know what gets me
about this, Malone?

173
00:09:50,426 --> 00:09:52,126
It's how weenie this stunt was.

174
00:09:52,161 --> 00:09:54,078
This is the best
you could come up with?

175
00:09:54,113 --> 00:09:55,847
I am embarrassed, all right.

176
00:09:55,882 --> 00:09:57,783
Not for me, but for you.

177
00:09:59,135 --> 00:10:00,401
That's pretty small.

178
00:10:00,436 --> 00:10:02,070
Oh, yeah?

179
00:10:02,105 --> 00:10:04,072
I told you we should
have fixed his brakes.

180
00:10:04,107 --> 00:10:06,375
No, no...

181
00:10:06,409 --> 00:10:07,909
You think I'm humiliated?

182
00:10:07,944 --> 00:10:09,077
I'm not humiliated.

183
00:10:09,111 --> 00:10:11,112
Pretty weenie.

184
00:10:16,251 --> 00:10:18,319
Now I'm humiliated.

185
00:10:23,659 --> 00:10:25,393
Then, after lunch,
I had a patient.

186
00:10:25,427 --> 00:10:26,895
Three separate personalities,

187
00:10:26,929 --> 00:10:28,964
each one more boring
than the other.

188
00:10:28,998 --> 00:10:30,966
As a matter of fact,
he's the only one

189
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,702
who can tell them apart.

190
00:10:33,736 --> 00:10:35,871
Now, Lilith, darling,
let's remember our caveat.

191
00:10:35,905 --> 00:10:36,838
No more shop talk.

192
00:10:36,872 --> 00:10:37,939
It's the weekend.

193
00:10:37,973 --> 00:10:39,106
It's time to engage

194
00:10:39,141 --> 00:10:40,592
in nice, normal conversation.

195
00:10:40,626 --> 00:10:42,027
I'll, uh, get us
some drinks. Woody?

196
00:10:42,061 --> 00:10:44,763
Why do you have this obsession
with labeling everything?

197
00:10:44,797 --> 00:10:48,166
Normal, abnormal,
weekday, weekend.

198
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,401
Well, darling, I was only trying
to create a certain...

199
00:10:50,436 --> 00:10:52,470
In other words,
control the conversation.

200
00:10:52,505 --> 00:10:54,272
That's rather compulsive,
isn't it?

201
00:10:54,306 --> 00:10:56,508
Well, how anal of you to notice.

202
00:10:58,544 --> 00:11:00,679
Oh, the whole world's anal
to you.

203
00:11:00,813 --> 00:11:03,231
Well, what say we, uh,
sleep in late tomorrow

204
00:11:03,265 --> 00:11:04,599
and have eggs Benedict?

205
00:11:04,633 --> 00:11:05,399
I love you.

206
00:11:13,175 --> 00:11:14,442
Pest control.

207
00:11:15,344 --> 00:11:16,611
Where should we start?

208
00:11:16,645 --> 00:11:18,463
Excuse me. What's this about?

209
00:11:18,498 --> 00:11:19,798
Your rat problem.

210
00:11:19,832 --> 00:11:21,132
Rat problem?

211
00:11:21,166 --> 00:11:23,368
Aren't you the one that called
about a rat problem?

212
00:11:23,402 --> 00:11:25,069
No, of course not.

213
00:11:25,104 --> 00:11:27,338
No. We don't have rats.

214
00:11:27,373 --> 00:11:29,040
Well, that's
what we understand, ma'am.

215
00:11:29,074 --> 00:11:30,809
Rats in the building...
big gray ones.

216
00:11:30,843 --> 00:11:32,009
That's why we're here.

217
00:11:32,044 --> 00:11:33,378
Excuse... Everybody hold on.

218
00:11:33,412 --> 00:11:34,679
There are no rats here.

219
00:11:34,714 --> 00:11:36,882
Oh, of course, Rebecca,
we believe you.

220
00:11:36,916 --> 00:11:39,400
If you should run across
any white ones, about yea big,

221
00:11:39,435 --> 00:11:42,337
I'd be happy to give you
four dollars apiece for them.

222
00:11:44,006 --> 00:11:45,173
What do you use them for?

223
00:11:45,207 --> 00:11:47,742
Snacks.

224
00:11:47,776 --> 00:11:50,211
Everyone just stay
where you are.

225
00:11:50,246 --> 00:11:51,746
There are no rats.

226
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:53,248
Free round of drinks
on the house.

227
00:11:53,282 --> 00:11:54,349
I wouldn't do that, ma'am.

228
00:11:54,383 --> 00:11:55,751
Those little buggers
might already

229
00:11:55,785 --> 00:11:57,052
have gotten into your beer.

230
00:11:57,086 --> 00:11:58,169
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

231
00:11:58,203 --> 00:12:00,304
I'll chance it.

232
00:12:00,339 --> 00:12:03,357
Sam, did you call anyone
about a rat problem?

233
00:12:03,392 --> 00:12:04,826
No, no. We have a rat problem?

234
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:06,060
Ew, God.

235
00:12:06,094 --> 00:12:07,295
I didn't call, you didn't call.

236
00:12:07,329 --> 00:12:08,730
Who called?

237
00:12:08,764 --> 00:12:10,949
Gary. Gary. Gary.

238
00:12:11,451 --> 00:12:12,700
How did he know

239
00:12:12,735 --> 00:12:14,536
we have rats?

240
00:12:14,570 --> 00:12:16,538
Uh, look, if you need us, uh...

241
00:12:16,572 --> 00:12:18,272
here's our card.

242
00:12:20,776 --> 00:12:22,627
Come again.

243
00:12:24,563 --> 00:12:27,298
"Now that's a stunt.

244
00:12:27,333 --> 00:12:30,001
Love, Gary."

245
00:12:30,036 --> 00:12:32,103
He's mine.

246
00:12:48,237 --> 00:12:49,537
Mess with us, huh?

247
00:12:49,571 --> 00:12:50,538
Wait till he finds

248
00:12:50,572 --> 00:12:52,857
the prune juice in his Kahlua.

249
00:12:52,891 --> 00:12:54,559
Yeah, what about
the sneezing powder

250
00:12:54,593 --> 00:12:56,027
in the ventilation system, huh?

251
00:12:56,062 --> 00:12:57,562
That was the coup de ville, huh?

252
00:12:57,596 --> 00:12:59,764
Yeah, Gary's messed around
with the wrong guys.

253
00:13:01,033 --> 00:13:03,134
I wish I was there to
see the stupid looks

254
00:13:03,169 --> 00:13:04,809
on their faces, you know?

255
00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:13,190
Hey, hey, who's the chrome dome?

256
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,080
I don't know.

257
00:13:16,115 --> 00:13:17,315
I've never seen him before.

258
00:13:17,349 --> 00:13:19,517
Uh-huh.

259
00:13:19,551 --> 00:13:20,886
Afternoon.

260
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,120
I'll have a draft.

261
00:13:22,155 --> 00:13:25,090
Excuse me there,
uh, pal of mine.

262
00:13:25,124 --> 00:13:26,391
Yeah?

263
00:13:26,425 --> 00:13:27,459
Eh, what exactly

264
00:13:27,493 --> 00:13:29,027
are you, uh, doing in here?

265
00:13:29,061 --> 00:13:31,062
Getting a drink.

266
00:13:31,096 --> 00:13:32,330
Aha.

267
00:13:32,364 --> 00:13:33,030
So, uh, you're not

268
00:13:33,065 --> 00:13:34,499
from the neighborhood, are you?

269
00:13:34,533 --> 00:13:35,850
No, no, I'm from Framingham.

270
00:13:35,885 --> 00:13:37,485
Uh, my wife's at Mass General.

271
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:39,120
She just had a double bypass,

272
00:13:39,154 --> 00:13:41,689
and I thought I'd
unwind a little with a drink.

273
00:13:41,724 --> 00:13:43,224
That okay?

274
00:13:45,661 --> 00:13:47,411
Sure.

275
00:13:49,915 --> 00:13:51,555
Let's shave his head
and put him on a bus!

276
00:13:52,635 --> 00:13:53,952
Excuse me.

277
00:13:53,986 --> 00:13:55,086
On second thought,

278
00:13:55,121 --> 00:13:56,387
I think I'll check to see

279
00:13:56,421 --> 00:13:58,422
if they have a juice machine
in the ICU.

280
00:13:58,457 --> 00:13:59,590
Yeah.

281
00:13:59,625 --> 00:14:00,792
You do that, pal.

282
00:14:00,826 --> 00:14:03,862
Hey, you tell Dr. Gary
the gang at Cheers says hello.

283
00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:05,797
Huh? Right, huh?

284
00:14:05,915 --> 00:14:07,482
Okay. I don't know.

285
00:14:07,517 --> 00:14:09,651
What, does he think
we're idiots or something?

286
00:14:14,624 --> 00:14:15,791
Did anybody remember

287
00:14:15,825 --> 00:14:17,726
to grease the bar stools
over at Gary's?

288
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,093
Oh yeah. Yeah, I did.

289
00:14:19,128 --> 00:14:20,595
Woody, get this man

290
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:21,779
his favorite.

291
00:14:21,813 --> 00:14:23,581
Hello, everyone.

292
00:14:23,616 --> 00:14:26,417
Thank you, thank you.

293
00:14:26,452 --> 00:14:27,519
You're too kind.

294
00:14:27,553 --> 00:14:28,853
May I please see the manager?

295
00:14:28,887 --> 00:14:29,871
I'm the manager.

296
00:14:29,905 --> 00:14:30,772
Can I help you?

297
00:14:30,806 --> 00:14:32,373
Oh, so you're the manager.

298
00:14:32,407 --> 00:14:34,275
Finally something in this place
worth looking at.

299
00:14:34,309 --> 00:14:35,409
I'm, uh, Gary

300
00:14:35,444 --> 00:14:37,612
from the Old Town Tavern.

301
00:14:37,646 --> 00:14:38,847
Well, well, well.

302
00:14:38,881 --> 00:14:41,783
I never expected to see you
step foot in this bar.

303
00:14:41,817 --> 00:14:43,651
Now I can call the exterminator.

304
00:14:43,685 --> 00:14:45,019
Oh, gee, I'm sorry
you feel that way.

305
00:14:45,054 --> 00:14:46,287
Although I can't
say I blame you.

306
00:14:46,321 --> 00:14:47,355
Things did...

307
00:14:47,389 --> 00:14:48,422
kind of get out of hand,

308
00:14:48,457 --> 00:14:49,924
but hey, we're both
professionals here.

309
00:14:49,959 --> 00:14:51,960
Why don't we just
call this whole thing off

310
00:14:51,994 --> 00:14:53,561
before we lose
any more customers?

311
00:14:53,595 --> 00:14:55,463
Look, uh, I have to admit,

312
00:14:55,497 --> 00:14:57,232
that when I first heard
that you personally

313
00:14:57,266 --> 00:14:58,566
authorized some of these pranks,

314
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,935
I was a little
ticked off myself.

315
00:14:59,969 --> 00:15:01,286
But now that I've met you,

316
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:03,121
why don't we call that
water under the bridge,

317
00:15:03,155 --> 00:15:06,574
and have a new era of
peaceful coexistence?

318
00:15:06,609 --> 00:15:08,910
Hmm?

319
00:15:08,944 --> 00:15:11,613
All right. Truce.

320
00:15:11,647 --> 00:15:12,880
Whoa, I feel like

321
00:15:12,915 --> 00:15:15,083
a giant weight has been lifted

322
00:15:15,117 --> 00:15:16,484
from my shoulders.

323
00:15:18,553 --> 00:15:20,354
Do you mind
if I call you sometime

324
00:15:20,388 --> 00:15:22,607
and maybe we go out
for a cup of coffee?

325
00:15:22,642 --> 00:15:23,825
Sure, why not?

326
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:26,761
I like coffee.

327
00:15:28,114 --> 00:15:31,316
Uh, see ya.

328
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:32,317
How could

329
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:33,551
you do that?

330
00:15:33,585 --> 00:15:35,553
How could I do what?

331
00:15:35,587 --> 00:15:38,189
After all that's
happened around here,

332
00:15:38,224 --> 00:15:40,658
you can go on a
date with that rat?

333
00:15:40,692 --> 00:15:43,328
Would you please
not say that word?

334
00:15:47,433 --> 00:15:50,501
I happen to think Gary
made a lot of sense.

335
00:15:50,536 --> 00:15:52,304
Besides, he's kind of cute.

336
00:15:52,338 --> 00:15:55,273
Cute?! You think Gary's cute?

337
00:15:55,308 --> 00:15:57,508
Yeah, he's got a real cool
face and a nice body.

338
00:15:57,543 --> 00:15:58,944
He looks kind of
like an athlete.

339
00:15:58,978 --> 00:16:00,178
Hey, what am I?

340
00:16:00,212 --> 00:16:02,180
Jealous.

341
00:16:04,967 --> 00:16:06,034
Excuse me.

342
00:16:09,538 --> 00:16:11,940
There are sheep in my office!

343
00:16:11,974 --> 00:16:13,942
Whoa, sheep. Ho-ho!

344
00:16:13,976 --> 00:16:17,478
You got to admire that, huh?

345
00:16:17,512 --> 00:16:19,747
I thought it smelled like home.

346
00:16:22,017 --> 00:16:22,767
I'm gonna get him.

347
00:16:22,885 --> 00:16:24,285
I'm going to rip his head off.

348
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:26,521
Aw, but he's so cute.

349
00:16:26,555 --> 00:16:27,789
And then I'm going
to tie him up,

350
00:16:27,823 --> 00:16:29,123
and I'm going to take a lighter,

351
00:16:29,158 --> 00:16:31,325
and I'm going to torch him
from the tip of his toes

352
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,460
to the top of his head.

353
00:16:32,494 --> 00:16:33,628
How come you never

354
00:16:33,663 --> 00:16:35,303
do stuff like that to me?

355
00:16:35,969 --> 00:16:38,009
Don't worry about it.
Don't worry about it.

356
00:16:38,034 --> 00:16:39,155
It's all taken care of here.

357
00:16:41,170 --> 00:16:43,371
You all set?

358
00:16:43,405 --> 00:16:44,906
Yep.

359
00:16:46,291 --> 00:16:48,058
Tool box, check.

360
00:16:48,093 --> 00:16:50,261
Coaxial cable, check.

361
00:16:50,296 --> 00:16:52,930
VCR, check.

362
00:16:52,964 --> 00:16:54,098
Tape.

363
00:16:54,132 --> 00:16:55,333
Check.

364
00:16:55,367 --> 00:16:57,134
Good luck, babe.

365
00:16:57,169 --> 00:16:58,403
Carla?

366
00:16:58,437 --> 00:17:00,004
Carla?

367
00:17:00,038 --> 00:17:01,606
Carla?

368
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:04,074
You're not going to do
anything illegal, are you?

369
00:17:04,109 --> 00:17:06,927
What makes you say that?

370
00:17:15,938 --> 00:17:18,256
Ladies and gentlemen!
Ladies and gentlemen!

371
00:17:18,290 --> 00:17:21,276
Gary's Old Town Tavern
is once again proud to present

372
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:23,244
the finest in world-class boxing

373
00:17:23,279 --> 00:17:25,913
on the largest screen TV
available in any bar

374
00:17:25,947 --> 00:17:28,416
in the greater
Metropolitan Boston area!

375
00:17:32,538 --> 00:17:33,555
Grab a drink,

376
00:17:33,673 --> 00:17:35,040
sit back, relax,

377
00:17:35,074 --> 00:17:36,941
and let the bloodletting begin!

378
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,260
All right.

379
00:17:39,295 --> 00:17:40,695
The months of waiting are over.

380
00:17:40,729 --> 00:17:41,963
We've heard all the hype,

381
00:17:41,997 --> 00:17:44,099
we know how many millions
are on the line.

382
00:17:44,133 --> 00:17:45,266
This is the big one.

383
00:17:45,301 --> 00:17:46,568
Here we go!

384
00:17:47,736 --> 00:17:49,904
Good evening, I'm Norm Peterson.

385
00:17:49,938 --> 00:17:52,240
And I'm Clifford C. Clavin.

386
00:17:53,308 --> 00:17:55,476
Welcome to an evening of poetry.

387
00:17:55,511 --> 00:17:56,243
We're so glad that

388
00:17:56,278 --> 00:17:57,728
you've chosen to ignore

389
00:17:57,763 --> 00:17:58,713
the fisticuffs they're watching

390
00:17:58,747 --> 00:18:00,064
over at Cheers right now,

391
00:18:00,099 --> 00:18:02,666
uh, three blocks down
and on your right,

392
00:18:02,701 --> 00:18:04,702
drinks half price if you
mention, "Gary sent me."

393
00:18:04,736 --> 00:18:06,370
Tapped into the cable.

394
00:18:06,404 --> 00:18:08,406
Instead, relax with us and enjoy

395
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:09,707
as we read and interpret

396
00:18:09,741 --> 00:18:12,710
the many works of
Dante Gabriel Rosetti,

397
00:18:12,744 --> 00:18:15,579
the famous 19th century
poet and fancy guy.

398
00:18:15,614 --> 00:18:16,564
Clifford?

399
00:18:16,598 --> 00:18:17,882
Norman...

400
00:18:17,916 --> 00:18:20,218
I'd like to start with
"The Ballad of the Dead Ladies."

401
00:18:20,252 --> 00:18:21,219
Ah.

402
00:18:21,253 --> 00:18:22,720
An excellent choice.

403
00:18:22,755 --> 00:18:24,789
It's written
in iambic pentathlon

404
00:18:24,823 --> 00:18:26,557
with, uh, rhyming couplets,

405
00:18:26,591 --> 00:18:28,359
every couple of couplets.

406
00:18:28,393 --> 00:18:31,362
"Tell me now, in what hidden way"

407
00:18:31,397 --> 00:18:34,198
"is Lady Flora
the lovely Roman?"

408
00:18:38,721 --> 00:18:40,704
Oh, oh, oh.

409
00:18:40,739 --> 00:18:42,040
Hey, uh, Gary.

410
00:18:43,242 --> 00:18:44,542
What's up, buddy?

411
00:18:44,576 --> 00:18:45,577
I want to know, did you enjoy

412
00:18:45,664 --> 00:18:46,904
the, uh, fight the other night?

413
00:18:46,929 --> 00:18:47,829
Yeah.

414
00:18:47,863 --> 00:18:50,064
Who'd you bet on...
Shelley or Keats?

415
00:18:51,099 --> 00:18:52,200
You guys are great.

416
00:18:52,234 --> 00:18:54,435
I tell you,
I didn't know you had it ya.

417
00:18:54,469 --> 00:18:55,536
You know what?

418
00:18:55,570 --> 00:18:57,771
This is going to go down
in the annals of gags

419
00:18:57,806 --> 00:18:58,940
as one of the greatest.

420
00:18:58,974 --> 00:19:00,214
Here, give me your hands, guys.

421
00:19:00,242 --> 00:19:01,775
I got something better
for you, though,

422
00:19:01,810 --> 00:19:04,078
than a trophy now.

423
00:19:04,112 --> 00:19:05,429
Come on, Gare. No, no, no.

424
00:19:05,464 --> 00:19:06,530
On the level.

425
00:19:06,565 --> 00:19:08,399
No crossed fingers,
standing on both feet.

426
00:19:08,433 --> 00:19:11,903
I am a personal
friend of Wade Boggs.

427
00:19:11,937 --> 00:19:13,671
<i>The Wade Boggs, who was gonna
come over to my place,</i>

428
00:19:13,705 --> 00:19:14,739
sign some autographs,

429
00:19:14,773 --> 00:19:15,807
but I rerouted him over here.

430
00:19:15,841 --> 00:19:17,408
He should be here any minute.

431
00:19:17,443 --> 00:19:19,209
You take good care of him, okay?

432
00:19:19,244 --> 00:19:20,661
You guys are the greatest.

433
00:19:20,695 --> 00:19:22,463
I didn't know you had it in you.

434
00:19:22,497 --> 00:19:25,199
Take care.

435
00:19:25,234 --> 00:19:26,534
Did you guys hear that?

436
00:19:26,569 --> 00:19:28,236
Wade Boggs is coming here.

437
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:29,804
All right. All right.

438
00:19:29,838 --> 00:19:30,955
Who's Wade Boggs?

439
00:19:30,989 --> 00:19:32,123
"Who's Wade Boggs?"!

440
00:19:32,157 --> 00:19:34,692
He's only the
greatest third baseman

441
00:19:34,726 --> 00:19:35,876
in Red Sox history.

442
00:19:35,911 --> 00:19:36,911
Guy's a pure hitter.

443
00:19:36,945 --> 00:19:39,113
He's only popped up six
times in five years.

444
00:19:39,147 --> 00:19:40,782
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

445
00:19:40,816 --> 00:19:43,051
I'm standing in a room
full of idiots.

446
00:19:43,085 --> 00:19:45,386
That's true. What's your point?

447
00:19:46,722 --> 00:19:48,840
Gary's not gonna send
the real Wade Boggs

448
00:19:48,874 --> 00:19:49,974
over to see us.

449
00:19:50,008 --> 00:19:52,509
He's gonna get some guy
in a Wade Boggs suit,

450
00:19:52,544 --> 00:19:54,145
claiming to be Wade Boggs.

451
00:19:54,179 --> 00:19:56,414
We're all gonna slobber
all over him,

452
00:19:56,448 --> 00:19:58,916
buy him drinks,
beg him for autographs

453
00:19:58,950 --> 00:20:02,320
and Gary'll come in
and bust a gut laughing at us.

454
00:20:07,309 --> 00:20:09,026
Excuse me.

455
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:10,862
Can I help you?

456
00:20:10,896 --> 00:20:12,262
Yeah, uh, Gary sent me over

457
00:20:12,297 --> 00:20:13,531
to sign some autographs.

458
00:20:13,565 --> 00:20:14,632
Hi, I'm Wade Boggs.

459
00:20:14,666 --> 00:20:15,700
Hi.

460
00:20:15,734 --> 00:20:17,301
Wade Boggs, huh?

461
00:20:18,269 --> 00:20:20,110
Yeah, how you doing?
I'm Babe Ruth.

462
00:20:21,557 --> 00:20:24,492
Yeah, I'm his, uh,
good friend Dizzy Dean.

463
00:20:25,994 --> 00:20:28,028
And I'm Woody Boyd.

464
00:20:30,916 --> 00:20:32,716
Are you sure
that isn't Wade Boggs?

465
00:20:32,751 --> 00:20:34,485
I mean,
it really looks like him.

466
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:35,619
Oh, Carla, come on.

467
00:20:35,654 --> 00:20:36,921
That's not Wade Boggs.

468
00:20:36,955 --> 00:20:39,723
Wade Boggs is a big,
strapping lad like myself.

469
00:20:40,892 --> 00:20:44,529
Uh, Mr., uh, Wade Boggs,

470
00:20:44,563 --> 00:20:46,030
what, uh...

471
00:20:46,065 --> 00:20:47,898
what are we batting these days?

472
00:20:47,933 --> 00:20:49,400
Something like .360, huh?

473
00:20:49,435 --> 00:20:51,302
- .361.
- Oh.

474
00:20:51,336 --> 00:20:53,604
Well, welcome to Cheers, Mr...

475
00:20:53,638 --> 00:20:56,507
Wade Boggs.

476
00:20:58,077 --> 00:21:00,878
I thought you folks
were, uh, Red Sox fans.

477
00:21:00,912 --> 00:21:03,347
Oh, yeah, we're,
we're Red Sox fans.

478
00:21:03,382 --> 00:21:06,217
Sure, Mr. Wade Boggs.

479
00:21:06,251 --> 00:21:07,985
As a matter of fact, uh,

480
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:10,454
we'd, uh, like to give you
a nice welcome

481
00:21:10,488 --> 00:21:12,556
that we give
all great sports stars

482
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:14,425
that happen by to Cheers here.

483
00:21:15,351 --> 00:21:17,271
Maybe I ought to
get out of here.

484
00:21:17,296 --> 00:21:18,377
Hurry, guys! Let's get him!

485
00:21:33,362 --> 00:21:36,030
Whoo-hoo!

486
00:21:36,064 --> 00:21:38,832
Man, that guy was
a lot quicker than he looked.

487
00:21:38,867 --> 00:21:39,933
Yeah. Let's, uh,

488
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:41,802
check out this guy's wallet.

489
00:21:41,836 --> 00:21:44,338
Find out who this
joker really was.

490
00:21:44,373 --> 00:21:45,440
Yeah, this, uh,

491
00:21:45,474 --> 00:21:48,209
this guy's name
was... Wade Boggs.

492
00:21:48,243 --> 00:21:52,079
Wait. Wow, what a coincidence.

493
00:21:52,113 --> 00:21:54,031
Well, I guess Gary went
to a lot of trouble

494
00:21:54,066 --> 00:21:55,733
to make up fake I.D.'s
for this guy and...

495
00:21:55,767 --> 00:21:57,902
credit cards and...

496
00:21:57,936 --> 00:22:00,905
photo of him with
Jim Rice and Dwight Evans.

497
00:22:03,642 --> 00:22:05,076
Oh, I'm sorry I'm late, guys.

498
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:06,310
I had a rough night.

499
00:22:06,344 --> 00:22:08,212
I was out showing
Gary's steady chick

500
00:22:08,246 --> 00:22:09,379
the time of her life.

501
00:22:10,448 --> 00:22:12,233
Whoo.

502
00:22:12,267 --> 00:22:14,151
Did I miss anything?

503
00:22:14,186 --> 00:22:15,853
No, no, just an average day.

504
00:22:15,887 --> 00:22:17,722
We refilled the pretzel bowls,

505
00:22:17,756 --> 00:22:20,525
played a little darts,
pantsed Wade Boggs,

506
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:22,610
watched a little TV.
Wait, you did what?

507
00:22:22,644 --> 00:22:25,796
Oh, man, we thought it was
another one of Gary's tricks.

508
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:27,932
So that's who was
running out there

509
00:22:27,966 --> 00:22:29,934
in his underwear in traffic.

510
00:22:29,968 --> 00:22:31,602
You know, you see...

511
00:22:31,636 --> 00:22:33,371
Gary has pulled off
the greatest,

512
00:22:33,405 --> 00:22:35,139
most ingenious
trick of them all.

513
00:22:35,174 --> 00:22:37,075
He's gotten us to get ourselves.

514
00:22:37,109 --> 00:22:38,292
Frasier's right.

515
00:22:38,326 --> 00:22:39,927
We can't top this.

516
00:22:39,962 --> 00:22:41,528
Gary's beaten us.

517
00:22:41,563 --> 00:22:43,864
You know, it's really
rather Machiavellian.

518
00:22:43,898 --> 00:22:45,316
Hey.

519
00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:48,202
Come on, guys.

520
00:22:48,236 --> 00:22:50,721
So we've been humiliated
in every sport.

521
00:22:50,755 --> 00:22:52,039
We've still got something

522
00:22:52,073 --> 00:22:53,608
that Gary can't take away.

523
00:22:54,392 --> 00:22:55,843
Our pride?

524
00:22:55,877 --> 00:22:58,512
Hell, no. We never had that.

525
00:22:58,547 --> 00:23:00,631
We have got

526
00:23:00,665 --> 00:23:03,400
the great Wade Boggs' pants!

527
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:07,688
Well, it's either
this or nothing.

528
00:23:11,710 --> 00:23:13,377
We're number one!

529
00:23:13,412 --> 00:23:15,346
We're number one!

530
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:17,348
We're number one!

531
00:23:17,382 --> 00:23:18,649
We're number one!

532
00:23:18,684 --> 00:23:20,217
We're number one!

533
00:23:20,252 --> 00:23:21,552
Hey! We're number one!

534
00:23:21,587 --> 00:23:24,088
Pretty weenie.
