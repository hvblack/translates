1
00:00:03,111 --> 00:00:06,413
<i>Cheers is filmed
before a live studio audience.</i>

2
00:00:06,413 --> 00:00:09,386
Carla, you look spiffy.
You going out tonight?

3
00:00:09,386 --> 00:00:12,698
Yeah, Eddie
and I are catching a movie.
This is his last night in town.

4
00:00:12,732 --> 00:00:15,515
He's going out on the road again
with the ice show.

5
00:00:15,847 --> 00:00:18,687
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Oh, nothing.

6
00:00:18,721 --> 00:00:21,386
Well, you know,
I get this image of, you know,

7
00:00:21,386 --> 00:00:24,793
chorus girls in skimpy costumes,
you know, skating around,

8
00:00:24,827 --> 00:00:27,278
lonely husband on the road,
far away

9
00:00:27,278 --> 00:00:31,244
from his, uh,
connubial connubials,
if you know what I mean.

10
00:00:31,244 --> 00:00:35,113
- Well, y-you're not worried?
- Not at all.

11
00:00:35,113 --> 00:00:38,340
I know my Eddie,
and I trust him completely.

12
00:00:38,375 --> 00:00:42,280
He is the sweetest,
most faithful, loving husband in
the whole world,

13
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:44,727
and I
thank God every day
he married me.

14
00:00:44,727 --> 00:00:48,150
If ever there
was a one-woman man,
it's Eddie LeBec.

15
00:00:48,185 --> 00:00:52,109
- Hey, Carla,
what movie you going to see?
- Fatal Attraction.

16
00:00:59,562 --> 00:01:02,130
¶ Making your way
in the world today ¶

17
00:01:02,165 --> 00:01:05,133
¶ Takes everything you've got.

18
00:01:05,168 --> 00:01:07,969
¶ Taking a break
from all your worries ¶

19
00:01:08,004 --> 00:01:11,072
¶ Sure would help a lot.

20
00:01:11,107 --> 00:01:15,475
¶ Wouldn't you like
to get away? ¶

21
00:01:16,846 --> 00:01:19,348
¶ Sometimes you want to go.

22
00:01:19,383 --> 00:01:23,460
¶ Where everybody
knows your name ¶

23
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:28,958
¶ And they're always glad
you came ¶

24
00:01:29,192 --> 00:01:31,658
¶ You want to be
where you can see ¶

25
00:01:31,658 --> 00:01:34,313
¶ Our troubles
are all the same ¶

26
00:01:34,347 --> 00:01:39,160
¶ You want to be where everybody
knows your name ¶

27
00:01:39,545 --> 00:01:42,221
¶ You want to go
where people know ¶

28
00:01:42,255 --> 00:01:44,418
¶ People are all the same.

29
00:01:44,418 --> 00:01:49,708
¶ You want to go where
everybody knows your name. ¶

30
00:02:09,933 --> 00:02:11,533
Good evening, everyone.

31
00:02:11,567 --> 00:02:15,767
You'll be glad to know
I decided to take your advice
and become more dynamic.

32
00:02:15,767 --> 00:02:19,057
I have just left a seminar
that has changed my life.

33
00:02:19,092 --> 00:02:23,495
In a few short hours,
I have become the essence
of self assertiveness.

34
00:02:23,529 --> 00:02:29,200
Five.
Four,
three, two, one!

35
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:34,840
What's going on here?
What's going on?

36
00:02:34,875 --> 00:02:37,959
Hey, I run this place.
What's happening?

37
00:02:43,016 --> 00:02:47,351
If somebody doesn't tell me
what's going on,
I am gonna start crying.

38
00:02:47,351 --> 00:02:49,956
Aw,
we're sorry. Uh, we didn't know
you were here.

39
00:02:49,956 --> 00:02:51,840
Today is our anniversary.

40
00:02:51,875 --> 00:02:53,264
This is the day, two years ago

41
00:02:53,264 --> 00:02:58,121
where Cheers beat
that scourge down the road,
Gary's Old Town Tavern,
in bowling!

42
00:02:58,849 --> 00:03:02,811
- That's-That's the big deal?
- It's the only time
we ever won anything.

43
00:03:02,819 --> 00:03:04,432
I take it that they've
beaten us at things.

44
00:03:04,432 --> 00:03:07,656
At everything.
Touch football, softball, darts,

45
00:03:07,656 --> 00:03:09,991
ugliest toes, you name it...

46
00:03:10,026 --> 00:03:12,942
I think the current
tally is 173 to one,

47
00:03:12,942 --> 00:03:15,982
but we are presently
on a winning streak.

48
00:03:16,932 --> 00:03:18,333
We're number one!

49
00:03:18,333 --> 00:03:23,023
We're number one!
We're number one!

50
00:03:23,023 --> 00:03:28,916
Sammy! Sammy!
Isn't it about time
for the call?

51
00:03:28,916 --> 00:03:33,124
- By golly, yes, it is.
- Time to give him a call?

52
00:03:33,366 --> 00:03:35,467
Hear ye, hear ye.

53
00:03:35,502 --> 00:03:38,716
It's time
for the ceremonial call
to Gary's!

54
00:03:38,716 --> 00:03:41,828
The call!
The call...!

55
00:03:46,896 --> 00:03:50,298
Hello, Gary.
It's Sam Malone.

56
00:03:50,333 --> 00:03:53,324
Yeah, I was just calling
to say hi, see how you're doing.

57
00:03:53,324 --> 00:03:58,141
No. You know,
for the life of me,
I-I can't think
of what brought you to mind.

58
00:03:58,141 --> 00:04:02,978
No, wait a minute, may...
Maybe it was because
two years ago tonight,

59
00:04:03,012 --> 00:04:06,519
we waxed your heinie in bowling!

60
00:04:08,217 --> 00:04:09,802
No, no. Oh...

61
00:04:09,836 --> 00:04:13,355
- The poor sap is begging
for a rematch.
- No. No, no.

62
00:04:13,389 --> 00:04:16,592
I'm sorry, Gary, no.
No, there'll be no rematch.

63
00:04:16,626 --> 00:04:20,579
The moment of victory
is frozen in time.

64
00:04:20,613 --> 00:04:24,248
That's right. Gar...
Hello? Gary?

65
00:04:24,667 --> 00:04:27,436
The guy is such a poor loser.

66
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:29,656
Drinks on the house!

67
00:04:29,656 --> 00:04:33,318
Carla, Carla,
once more around
the bar, huh? Huh?

68
00:04:34,127 --> 00:04:35,765
We're number one!

69
00:04:35,765 --> 00:04:37,929
Hold it. Hold it!

70
00:04:37,964 --> 00:04:41,326
Where is the trophy?
Who moved it?

71
00:04:42,001 --> 00:04:45,354
Oh, come on.
It's got to be around
here somewhere.

72
00:04:45,388 --> 00:04:48,674
Hey, now listen,
this is not funny.
Where is the trophy?

73
00:04:48,708 --> 00:04:51,894
Wa-hay-hay
hait a minute.

74
00:04:51,928 --> 00:04:55,480
- This smacks of Gary.
- Hey, you mean
he had a spy in here?

75
00:04:55,515 --> 00:04:58,706
Yeah, hey, that's right.
Who was that guy
at the end of the bar
drinking imported beer?

76
00:04:58,706 --> 00:05:02,270
Mm-hmm. Very suspicious.
You know none of us
can afford that stuff.

77
00:05:02,305 --> 00:05:04,694
Let's storm the place!

78
00:05:05,275 --> 00:05:09,511
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.
Come on, let's not turn this
into mob rule here.

79
00:05:09,545 --> 00:05:12,214
Just a couple of guys go over
and talk to him first. Come on.

80
00:05:12,248 --> 00:05:14,601
All right, Sam, I think
you better take me
because, uh,

81
00:05:14,601 --> 00:05:18,182
they got
to be intimidated
by the authority of my uniform.

82
00:05:18,666 --> 00:05:21,347
Actually, I think
I'll take Woody.

83
00:05:21,414 --> 00:05:24,376
You know, in case
there's some trouble,
I'd like to have someone
young and strong around.

84
00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:26,037
Come on, Woody.

85
00:05:38,074 --> 00:05:40,038
Good luck.

86
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:52,343
Our trophy!

87
00:05:52,343 --> 00:05:54,697
Oh,
Sam!

88
00:05:54,697 --> 00:05:57,759
What did you do to Gary?
Did you punch him
right in the face?

89
00:05:57,794 --> 00:05:59,709
Uh, n-not exactly, no.

90
00:05:59,709 --> 00:06:02,178
- He did ask out a waitress.
- Hey.

91
00:06:02,178 --> 00:06:04,052
Sam.

92
00:06:04,052 --> 00:06:09,467
Hey.
What are you all
sitting around here
like a bunch of wimps for?

93
00:06:09,467 --> 00:06:12,510
It's what wimps do.

94
00:06:16,412 --> 00:06:19,328
Let's go over to Gary's
and torch the place! Come on!

95
00:06:19,328 --> 00:06:23,135
Oh, no, no, come on, whoa, whoa.
There's got to be a cooler
way of doing this now.

96
00:06:23,169 --> 00:06:25,098
We got to use a little cunning.

97
00:06:25,098 --> 00:06:29,724
Yeah.
Yeah, I'd like
to do something to Gary
and make him really miserable.

98
00:06:29,758 --> 00:06:32,027
Why don't you marry him?

99
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:36,799
Why don't you?
Why don't you? Why don't you?

100
00:06:36,833 --> 00:06:38,517
You! You!
You! You!

101
00:06:38,551 --> 00:06:40,161
That's it!

102
00:06:40,161 --> 00:06:43,004
I do not want this thing
getting out of hand.

103
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:46,094
If this bar becomes
a high school locker room,
my patronage,

104
00:06:46,094 --> 00:06:49,011
other than the Bowery Boys,
will disappear.

105
00:06:49,045 --> 00:06:52,129
No, in this case,
I'm afraid
I must agree with Rebecca.

106
00:06:52,129 --> 00:06:53,899
Thank you, Dr. Crane.

107
00:06:53,933 --> 00:06:56,367
Well, it's-it's not
for your dollar-grubbing,

108
00:06:56,402 --> 00:06:59,206
you know, front office,
kissy face reasons, but...

109
00:07:00,356 --> 00:07:03,476
...it's because
revenge is never the answer.

110
00:07:03,476 --> 00:07:07,027
You see,
a potentially unending cycle of

111
00:07:07,027 --> 00:07:10,182
juvenile retaliation
can only lead to a...

112
00:07:10,216 --> 00:07:12,584
well, a kind of mob mentality,

113
00:07:12,619 --> 00:07:16,021
which will ultimately result
in a regrettable act.

114
00:07:16,055 --> 00:07:19,191
Wait a minute, Doc.
When Diane left you
at the altar,

115
00:07:19,225 --> 00:07:24,062
aren't you the guy
who enrolled her
in every tape, book,
and record club
known to mankind?

116
00:07:24,814 --> 00:07:26,524
Yes, but that was different.

117
00:07:26,549 --> 00:07:28,607
The pompous witch deserved it.

118
00:07:28,607 --> 00:07:30,957
No,
no, no, no, come on.

119
00:07:30,957 --> 00:07:34,269
We got to think of something
to get our pride back.

120
00:07:34,269 --> 00:07:35,507
Like what Sammy, huh? Well...

121
00:07:35,541 --> 00:07:39,160
There is one thing
you can beat
Gary's Old Town Tavern at.

122
00:07:39,195 --> 00:07:42,395
- Oh, yeah? What's that?
- Maturity.

123
00:08:03,219 --> 00:08:04,469
It's Al.

124
00:08:04,469 --> 00:08:07,756
Hey, Al, why aren't
you at Cheers?

125
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:10,759
Holy mackerel,
this isn't Cheers?

126
00:08:12,778 --> 00:08:15,643
Uh-oh, Malone's back.

127
00:08:15,643 --> 00:08:19,146
And this time,
he brought some muscle.

128
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:24,640
Sammy, I-I can't go
through with this,
not when this guy's
taking shots at me.

129
00:08:24,674 --> 00:08:29,249
- No, no, that was a shot at me.
- You're right. Okay.

130
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:32,192
Gary?
We're here in peace.

131
00:08:32,192 --> 00:08:34,494
Now we want
to let bygones be bygones,

132
00:08:34,494 --> 00:08:37,805
so we brought along
some champagne
to bury the hatchet.

133
00:08:37,805 --> 00:08:39,120
What do you say, huh?

134
00:08:39,155 --> 00:08:43,091
- Is that right?
No tricks?
- No tricks.

135
00:08:43,125 --> 00:08:46,872
Wow, that's damn decent
of you, Malone.
Milt, some glasses.

136
00:08:46,872 --> 00:08:51,580
I'll be honest with you.
I mean, last night at Cheers,
all we could talk
about was revenge.

137
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:53,835
That trophy meant
a great deal to us.

138
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:57,580
But then, you
know, cooler heads,
light of day and all
that kind of thing, we just...

139
00:08:57,580 --> 00:09:02,594
well, we realized
that to do battle with you
would just destroy both of us.

140
00:09:02,628 --> 00:09:08,016
At least we have
the satisfaction of knowing
that we, uh, we beat you
in one thing.

141
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:09,684
Maturity.

142
00:09:09,719 --> 00:09:12,278
Oh, actually, I'm afraid
you came up short there, too.

143
00:09:12,278 --> 00:09:15,924
I just sent a dozen roses
over to Cheers
with an apology note.

144
00:09:15,958 --> 00:09:17,794
Oh. Oh, well.

145
00:09:17,794 --> 00:09:19,674
Here's to Cheers.

146
00:09:19,674 --> 00:09:21,997
No, no, no.
To Gary's.

147
00:09:22,031 --> 00:09:24,733
Yeah, to Gary's! Yeah!

148
00:09:35,528 --> 00:09:40,282
Whoo! Gary, Gary, I think maybe
you ought to keep that
back window locked.

149
00:09:40,316 --> 00:09:44,853
You know, people could sneak
in here and steal some of this
fine crystal.

150
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:48,123
Come, my little
vandal, our job here is done.

151
00:09:48,157 --> 00:09:52,126
You know what gets me
about this, Malone?
It's how weenie this stunt was.

152
00:09:52,161 --> 00:09:54,028
This is the best
you could come up with?

153
00:09:54,063 --> 00:09:58,308
I am embarrassed, all right.
Not for me, but for you.

154
00:09:59,135 --> 00:10:01,000
That's pretty small.

155
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,070
Oh, yeah?

156
00:10:02,105 --> 00:10:05,657
- I told you we should
have fixed his brakes.
- No, no...

157
00:10:06,209 --> 00:10:09,077
You think I'm humiliated?
I'm not humiliated.

158
00:10:09,111 --> 00:10:11,827
Pretty weenie.

159
00:10:15,851 --> 00:10:18,319
Now I'm humiliated.

160
00:10:23,459 --> 00:10:25,537
Then, after lunch,
I had a patient.

161
00:10:25,537 --> 00:10:28,964
Three separate personalities,
each one more boring
than the other.

162
00:10:28,998 --> 00:10:33,102
As a matter of fact,
he's the only one
who can tell them apart.

163
00:10:33,102 --> 00:10:35,621
Now, Lilith, darling,
let's remember our caveat.

164
00:10:35,655 --> 00:10:37,939
No more shop talk.
It's the weekend.

165
00:10:37,973 --> 00:10:40,492
It's time to engage
in nice, normal conversation.

166
00:10:40,526 --> 00:10:41,827
I'll, uh, get us
some drinks. Woody?

167
00:10:41,861 --> 00:10:44,763
Why do you have this obsession
with labeling everything?

168
00:10:44,797 --> 00:10:48,166
Normal, abnormal,
weekday, weekend.

169
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,301
Well, darling, I was only trying
to create a certain...

170
00:10:50,336 --> 00:10:54,272
In other words,
control the conversation.
That's rather compulsive,
isn't it?

171
00:10:54,306 --> 00:10:57,056
Well, how anal of you to notice.

172
00:10:58,444 --> 00:11:01,187
Oh, the whole world's anal
to you.

173
00:11:01,187 --> 00:11:04,599
Well, what say we, uh,
sleep in late tomorrow
and have eggs Benedict?

174
00:11:04,633 --> 00:11:06,135
I love you.

175
00:11:13,234 --> 00:11:16,611
Pest control.
Where should we start?

176
00:11:16,645 --> 00:11:18,463
Excuse me. What's this about?

177
00:11:18,498 --> 00:11:21,188
- Your rat problem.
- Rat problem?

178
00:11:21,188 --> 00:11:23,368
Aren't you the one that called
about a rat problem?

179
00:11:23,402 --> 00:11:26,617
No, of course not.
No. We don't have rats.

180
00:11:26,873 --> 00:11:28,645
Well, that's
what we understand, ma'am.

181
00:11:28,645 --> 00:11:31,486
Rats in the building...
big gray ones.
That's why we're here.

182
00:11:31,486 --> 00:11:34,679
Excuse... Everybody hold on.
There are no rats here.

183
00:11:34,714 --> 00:11:36,527
Oh, of course, Rebecca,
we believe you.

184
00:11:36,527 --> 00:11:39,556
If you should run across
any white ones, about yea big,

185
00:11:39,556 --> 00:11:42,836
I'd be happy to give you
four dollars apiece for them.

186
00:11:44,006 --> 00:11:47,374
- What do you use them for?
- Snacks.

187
00:11:48,434 --> 00:11:51,546
Everyone just stay
where you are.
There are no rats.

188
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:53,198
Free round of drinks
on the house.

189
00:11:53,232 --> 00:11:57,002
I wouldn't do that, ma'am.
Those little buggers
might already
have gotten into your beer.

190
00:11:57,036 --> 00:11:59,588
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
I'll chance it.

191
00:12:00,339 --> 00:12:03,357
Sam, did you call anyone
about a rat problem?

192
00:12:03,392 --> 00:12:06,431
No, no. We have a rat problem?
Ew, God.

193
00:12:06,431 --> 00:12:09,018
I didn't call, you didn't call.
Who called?

194
00:12:09,018 --> 00:12:10,849
Gary. Gary. Gary.

195
00:12:11,351 --> 00:12:14,031
How did he know
we have rats?

196
00:12:14,570 --> 00:12:18,615
Uh, look, if you need us, uh...
here's our card.

197
00:12:20,576 --> 00:12:22,682
Come again.

198
00:12:24,999 --> 00:12:29,318
"Now that's a stunt.
Love, Gary."

199
00:12:29,318 --> 00:12:32,927
He's mine.

200
00:12:48,237 --> 00:12:49,859
Mess with us, huh?

201
00:12:49,859 --> 00:12:52,857
Wait till he finds
the prune juice in his Kahlua.

202
00:12:52,891 --> 00:12:55,927
Yeah, what about
the sneezing powder
in the ventilation system, huh?

203
00:12:55,962 --> 00:12:57,562
That was the coup de ville, huh?

204
00:12:57,596 --> 00:13:00,830
Yeah, Gary's messed around
with the wrong guys.

205
00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:05,009
I wish I was there to
see the stupid looks
on their faces, you know?

206
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:13,728
Hey, hey, who's the chrome dome?

207
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,480
I don't know.
I've never seen him before.

208
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:19,549
Uh-huh.

209
00:13:19,549 --> 00:13:21,970
Afternoon.
I'll have a draft.

210
00:13:22,005 --> 00:13:25,090
Excuse me there,
uh, pal of mine.

211
00:13:25,124 --> 00:13:26,136
Yeah?

212
00:13:26,136 --> 00:13:29,541
Eh, what exactly
are you, uh, doing in here?

213
00:13:29,541 --> 00:13:31,843
Getting a drink.

214
00:13:31,964 --> 00:13:34,245
So, uh, you're not
from the neighborhood, are you?

215
00:13:34,245 --> 00:13:37,874
No, no, I'm from Framingham.
Uh, my wife's at Mass General.

216
00:13:37,874 --> 00:13:41,873
She just had a double bypass,
and I thought I'd
unwind a little with a drink.

217
00:13:41,873 --> 00:13:43,871
That okay?

218
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:47,804
Sure.

219
00:13:49,715 --> 00:13:52,809
Let's shave his head
and put him on a bus!

220
00:13:52,809 --> 00:13:55,325
Excuse me.
On second thought,

221
00:13:55,325 --> 00:13:58,678
I think I'll check to see
if they have a juice machine
in the ICU.

222
00:13:58,678 --> 00:14:01,285
Yeah.
You do that, pal.

223
00:14:01,285 --> 00:14:04,611
Hey, you tell Dr. Gary
the gang at Cheers says hello.

224
00:14:06,742 --> 00:14:10,064
I don't know.
What, does he think
we're idiots or something?

225
00:14:14,424 --> 00:14:17,626
Did anybody remember
to grease the bar stools
over at Gary's?

226
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:19,317
Oh yeah. Yeah, I did.

227
00:14:19,317 --> 00:14:22,288
Woody, get this man
his favorite.

228
00:14:22,288 --> 00:14:24,743
Hello, everyone.

229
00:14:25,078 --> 00:14:27,351
Thank you, thank you.
You're too kind.

230
00:14:27,351 --> 00:14:28,653
May I please see the manager?

231
00:14:28,687 --> 00:14:30,722
I'm the manager.
Can I help you?

232
00:14:30,756 --> 00:14:34,275
Oh, so you're the manager.
Finally something in this place
worth looking at.

233
00:14:34,309 --> 00:14:37,562
I'm, uh, Gary
from the Old Town Tavern.

234
00:14:37,596 --> 00:14:41,968
Well, well, well.
I never expected to see you
step foot in this bar.

235
00:14:41,968 --> 00:14:43,797
Now I can call the exterminator.

236
00:14:43,797 --> 00:14:47,114
Oh, gee, I'm sorry
you feel that way.
Although I can't
say I blame you.

237
00:14:47,114 --> 00:14:49,874
Things did...
kind of get out of hand,
but hey, we're both
professionals here.

238
00:14:49,909 --> 00:14:53,561
Why don't we just
call this whole thing off
before we lose
any more customers?

239
00:14:53,595 --> 00:14:56,263
Look, uh, I have to admit,
that when I first heard

240
00:14:56,263 --> 00:14:59,213
that you personally
authorized some of these pranks,
I was a little
ticked off myself.

241
00:14:59,213 --> 00:15:03,343
But now that I've met you,
why don't we call that
water under the bridge,

242
00:15:03,343 --> 00:15:07,456
and have a new era of
peaceful coexistence?

243
00:15:08,944 --> 00:15:11,613
All right. Truce.

244
00:15:11,647 --> 00:15:17,284
Whoa, I feel like
a giant weight has been lifted
from my shoulders.

245
00:15:18,553 --> 00:15:22,557
Do you mind
if I call you sometime
and maybe we go out
for a cup of coffee?

246
00:15:22,592 --> 00:15:26,095
Sure, why not?
I like coffee.

247
00:15:28,114 --> 00:15:30,672
Uh, see ya.

248
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:33,977
How could
you do that?

249
00:15:33,977 --> 00:15:35,550
How could I do what?

250
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:38,089
After all that's
happened around here,

251
00:15:38,124 --> 00:15:40,914
you can go on a
date with that rat?

252
00:15:40,914 --> 00:15:43,894
Would you please
not say that word?

253
00:15:47,433 --> 00:15:50,614
I happen to think Gary
made a lot of sense.

254
00:15:50,614 --> 00:15:52,658
Besides, he's kind of cute.

255
00:15:52,658 --> 00:15:55,273
Cute?! You think Gary's cute?

256
00:15:55,308 --> 00:15:57,564
Yeah, he's got a real cool
face and a nice body.

257
00:15:57,564 --> 00:15:59,046
He looks kind of
like an athlete.

258
00:15:59,046 --> 00:16:02,498
- Hey, what am I?
- Jealous.

259
00:16:04,467 --> 00:16:06,610
Excuse me.

260
00:16:09,338 --> 00:16:11,940
There are sheep in my office!

261
00:16:11,974 --> 00:16:16,866
Whoa, sheep. Ho-ho!
You got to admire that, huh?

262
00:16:17,512 --> 00:16:20,428
I thought it smelled like home.

263
00:16:21,217 --> 00:16:24,285
I'm gonna get him.
I'm going to rip his head off.

264
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:26,421
Aw, but he's so cute.

265
00:16:26,455 --> 00:16:29,073
And then I'm going
to tie him up,
and I'm going to take a lighter,

266
00:16:29,108 --> 00:16:32,527
and I'm going to torch him
from the tip of his toes
to the top of his head.

267
00:16:32,527 --> 00:16:35,902
How come you never
do stuff like that to me?

268
00:16:35,969 --> 00:16:39,901
Don't worry about it.
Don't worry about it.
It's all taken care of here.

269
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:44,987
- You all set?
- Yep.

270
00:16:46,191 --> 00:16:48,427
Tool box, check.

271
00:16:48,427 --> 00:16:50,406
Coaxial cable, check.

272
00:16:50,406 --> 00:16:52,930
VCR, check.

273
00:16:52,964 --> 00:16:55,513
- Tape.
- Check.

274
00:16:55,513 --> 00:16:56,984
Good luck, babe.

275
00:16:57,019 --> 00:17:01,606
Carla?
Carla?
Carla?

276
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:04,024
You're not going to do
anything illegal, are you?

277
00:17:04,059 --> 00:17:06,210
What makes you say that?

278
00:17:15,738 --> 00:17:18,256
Ladies and gentlemen!
Ladies and gentlemen!

279
00:17:18,290 --> 00:17:22,660
Gary's Old Town Tavern
is once again proud to present
the finest in world-class boxing

280
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:25,670
on the largest screen TV
available in any bar

281
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:29,015
in the greater
Metropolitan Boston area!

282
00:17:32,238 --> 00:17:35,040
Grab a drink,
sit back, relax,

283
00:17:35,074 --> 00:17:37,714
and let the bloodletting begin!

284
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,707
All right.
The months of waiting are over.

285
00:17:40,707 --> 00:17:43,799
We've heard all the hype,
we know how many millions
are on the line.

286
00:17:43,833 --> 00:17:47,101
This is the big one.
Here we go!

287
00:17:47,636 --> 00:17:50,024
Good evening, I'm Norm Peterson.

288
00:17:50,024 --> 00:17:52,608
And I'm Clifford C. Clavin.

289
00:17:52,608 --> 00:17:55,122
Welcome to an evening of poetry.

290
00:17:55,122 --> 00:17:58,130
We're so glad that
you've chosen to ignore the fisticuffs

291
00:17:58,130 --> 00:18:02,485
they're watching
over at Cheers right now,
uh, three blocks down
and on your right,

292
00:18:02,485 --> 00:18:04,702
drinks half price if you
mention, "Gary sent me."

293
00:18:04,736 --> 00:18:05,970
Tapped into the cable.

294
00:18:06,004 --> 00:18:08,464
Instead, relax with us and enjoy

295
00:18:08,464 --> 00:18:12,246
as we read and interpret
the many works of
Dante Gabriel Rosetti,

296
00:18:12,246 --> 00:18:15,809
the famous 19th century
poet and fancy guy.

297
00:18:15,809 --> 00:18:17,051
Clifford?

298
00:18:17,051 --> 00:18:20,456
Norman...
I'd like to start with
"The Ballad of the Dead Ladies."

299
00:18:20,456 --> 00:18:22,720
Ah.
An excellent choice.

300
00:18:22,755 --> 00:18:26,557
It's written
in iambic pentathlon
with, uh, rhyming couplets,

301
00:18:26,591 --> 00:18:28,597
every couple of couplets.

302
00:18:28,597 --> 00:18:31,312
"Tell me now, in what hidden way"

303
00:18:31,347 --> 00:18:34,645
"is Lady Flora
the lovely Roman?"

304
00:18:40,239 --> 00:18:43,261
Hey, uh, Gary.

305
00:18:43,261 --> 00:18:44,542
What's up, buddy?

306
00:18:44,576 --> 00:18:47,170
I want to know, did you enjoy
the, uh, fight the other night?

307
00:18:47,170 --> 00:18:50,420
Yeah.
Who'd you bet on...
Shelley or Keats?

308
00:18:51,175 --> 00:18:54,435
You guys are great.
I tell you,
I didn't know you had it ya.

309
00:18:54,469 --> 00:18:58,940
You know what?
This is going to go down
in the annals of gags
as one of the greatest.

310
00:18:58,974 --> 00:19:00,486
Here, give me your hands, guys.

311
00:19:00,486 --> 00:19:03,617
I got something better
for you, though,
than a trophy now.

312
00:19:03,617 --> 00:19:05,379
Come on, Gare. No, no, no.

313
00:19:05,414 --> 00:19:08,399
On the level.
No crossed fingers,
standing on both feet.

314
00:19:08,433 --> 00:19:11,853
I am a personal
friend of Wade Boggs.

315
00:19:11,887 --> 00:19:15,108
The Wade Boggs, who was gonna
come over to my place,
sign some autographs,

316
00:19:15,108 --> 00:19:17,408
but I rerouted him over here.
He should be here any minute.

317
00:19:17,443 --> 00:19:19,328
You take good care of him, okay?

318
00:19:19,328 --> 00:19:22,896
You guys are the greatest.
I didn't know you had it in you.

319
00:19:22,896 --> 00:19:24,640
Take care.

320
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:28,639
Did you guys hear that?
Wade Boggs is coming here.

321
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:29,604
All right. All right.

322
00:19:29,638 --> 00:19:32,123
- Who's Wade Boggs?
- "Who's Wade Boggs?"!

323
00:19:32,157 --> 00:19:35,393
He's only the
greatest third baseman
in Red Sox history.

324
00:19:35,393 --> 00:19:39,113
Guy's a pure hitter.
He's only popped up six
times in five years.

325
00:19:39,147 --> 00:19:43,205
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
I'm standing in a room
full of idiots.

326
00:19:43,205 --> 00:19:46,003
That's true. What's your point?

327
00:19:46,622 --> 00:19:49,974
Gary's not gonna send
the real Wade Boggs
over to see us.

328
00:19:50,008 --> 00:19:54,145
He's gonna get some guy
in a Wade Boggs suit,
claiming to be Wade Boggs.

329
00:19:54,179 --> 00:19:59,056
We're all gonna slobber
all over him,
buy him drinks,
beg him for autographs

330
00:19:59,056 --> 00:20:02,872
and Gary'll come in
and bust a gut laughing at us.

331
00:20:08,028 --> 00:20:10,562
- Excuse me.
- Can I help you?

332
00:20:10,596 --> 00:20:13,615
Yeah, uh, Gary sent me over
to sign some autographs.

333
00:20:13,615 --> 00:20:16,046
- Hi, I'm Wade Boggs.
- Hi.

334
00:20:16,046 --> 00:20:17,935
Wade Boggs, huh?

335
00:20:17,935 --> 00:20:20,507
Yeah, how you doing?
I'm Babe Ruth.

336
00:20:20,857 --> 00:20:25,278
Yeah, I'm his, uh,
good friend Dizzy Dean.

337
00:20:25,794 --> 00:20:28,152
And I'm Woody Boyd.

338
00:20:30,716 --> 00:20:34,506
Are you sure
that isn't Wade Boggs?
I mean,
it really looks like him.

339
00:20:34,506 --> 00:20:36,821
Oh, Carla, come on.
That's not Wade Boggs.

340
00:20:36,855 --> 00:20:39,858
Wade Boggs is a big,
strapping lad like myself.

341
00:20:41,192 --> 00:20:44,923
Uh, Mr., uh, Wade Boggs,

342
00:20:44,923 --> 00:20:47,748
what, uh...
what are we batting these days?

343
00:20:47,783 --> 00:20:51,302
Something like .360, huh?
- .361.
- Oh.

344
00:20:51,336 --> 00:20:53,871
Well, welcome to Cheers, Mr...

345
00:20:53,962 --> 00:20:56,629
Wade Boggs.

346
00:20:57,877 --> 00:21:00,778
I thought you folks
were, uh, Red Sox fans.

347
00:21:00,812 --> 00:21:03,502
Oh, yeah, we're,
we're Red Sox fans.

348
00:21:03,502 --> 00:21:06,217
Sure, Mr. Wade Boggs.

349
00:21:06,251 --> 00:21:10,564
As a matter of fact, uh,
we'd, uh, like to give you
a nice welcome

350
00:21:10,564 --> 00:21:15,119
that we give
all great sports stars
that happen by to Cheers here.

351
00:21:15,351 --> 00:21:17,171
Maybe I ought to
get out of here.

352
00:21:17,196 --> 00:21:19,142
Hurry, guys! Let's get him!

353
00:21:35,864 --> 00:21:38,990
Man, that guy was
a lot quicker than he looked.

354
00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:41,502
Yeah. Let's, uh,
check out this guy's wallet.

355
00:21:41,536 --> 00:21:44,138
Find out who this
joker really was.

356
00:21:44,173 --> 00:21:48,209
Yeah, this, uh,
this guy's name
was... Wade Boggs.

357
00:21:48,243 --> 00:21:51,324
Wait. Wow, what a coincidence.

358
00:21:51,324 --> 00:21:55,733
Well, I guess Gary went
to a lot of trouble
to make up fake I.D.'s
for this guy and...

359
00:21:55,767 --> 00:21:57,902
credit cards and...

360
00:21:57,936 --> 00:22:01,627
photo of him with
Jim Rice and Dwight Evans.

361
00:22:03,442 --> 00:22:06,125
Oh, I'm sorry I'm late, guys.
I had a rough night.

362
00:22:06,125 --> 00:22:10,050
I was out showing
Gary's steady chick
the time of her life.

363
00:22:12,267 --> 00:22:14,101
Did I miss anything?

364
00:22:14,136 --> 00:22:16,130
No, no, just an average day.

365
00:22:16,130 --> 00:22:18,894
We refilled the pretzel bowls,
played a little darts,

366
00:22:18,894 --> 00:22:21,635
pantsed Wade Boggs,
watched a little TV.

367
00:22:21,635 --> 00:22:22,510
Wait, you did what?

368
00:22:22,544 --> 00:22:25,796
Oh, man, we thought it was
another one of Gary's tricks.

369
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:29,934
So that's who was
running out there
in his underwear in traffic.

370
00:22:30,204 --> 00:22:33,749
You know, you see...
Gary has pulled off
the greatest,

371
00:22:33,749 --> 00:22:36,975
most ingenious
trick of them all.
He's gotten us to get ourselves.

372
00:22:37,009 --> 00:22:39,927
Frasier's right.
We can't top this.

373
00:22:39,962 --> 00:22:41,428
Gary's beaten us.

374
00:22:41,463 --> 00:22:43,933
You know, it's really
rather Machiavellian.

375
00:22:43,933 --> 00:22:48,102
Hey.
Come on, guys.

376
00:22:48,136 --> 00:22:50,721
So we've been humiliated
in every sport.

377
00:22:50,755 --> 00:22:54,324
We've still got something
that Gary can't take away.

378
00:22:54,324 --> 00:22:58,588
- Our pride?
- Hell, no. We never had that.

379
00:22:58,588 --> 00:23:03,906
We have got
the great Wade Boggs' pants!

380
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:08,219
Well, it's either
this or nothing.

381
00:23:11,713 --> 00:23:21,824
We're number one!
We're number one!

382
00:23:21,824 --> 00:23:24,738
Pretty weenie.

383
00:23:24,739 --> 00:23:44,739
