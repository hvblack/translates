1
00:00:06,773 --> 00:00:09,609
I always admired
American stand-up specials,

2
00:00:09,693 --> 00:00:12,112
the way the comic
always seemed so cool,

3
00:00:12,195 --> 00:00:14,948
smoking a cigarette
even if they don't smoke,

4
00:00:15,031 --> 00:00:19,578
pulling up outside a packed venue
with not a care in the world.

5
00:00:20,745 --> 00:00:22,455
Hey, I get it.

6
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:26,793
Life moves fast,
so you got to walk slow.

7
00:00:28,169 --> 00:00:32,382
But it's my time now,
time for me to do my first special.

8
00:00:32,465 --> 00:00:33,508
It's time for me to shine.

9
00:00:33,592 --> 00:00:34,885
Hey, sweetheart.
How's your mother?

10
00:00:34,968 --> 00:00:38,805
Time for me to show everyone
what the fuck I've got.

11
00:00:41,182 --> 00:00:43,435
Brett, let's go. Showtime. Come on.

12
00:00:43,518 --> 00:00:45,103
I don't know why I said I'd do this.
I don't want to do this.

13
00:00:45,186 --> 00:00:46,730
There's too many people out there.
I don't want to do a special.

14
00:00:46,813 --> 00:00:48,565
- It's insane to do a special--
- Pull yourself together!

15
00:01:07,208 --> 00:01:10,420
Like I was saying, time to show them
what I'm made of...

16
00:01:10,503 --> 00:01:11,588
Oi!

17
00:01:12,422 --> 00:01:14,549
- Have a great show, Brett.
- Cheers, Buddy G.

18
00:01:14,633 --> 00:01:16,176
Just have fun!

19
00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:19,763
In the greatest place
on Earth, New Jersey.

20
00:01:44,204 --> 00:01:46,039
New Jersey, how are you?

21
00:01:51,086 --> 00:01:53,838
All right, then.
Let's start with my name.

22
00:01:53,922 --> 00:01:55,799
My name is Brett Goldstein.

23
00:01:55,882 --> 00:01:57,968
That is my real name.

24
00:01:58,051 --> 00:02:01,221
And where I come from
in London, England,

25
00:02:01,304 --> 00:02:03,807
that's quite an exotic name.

26
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:06,351
No one knows a Brett Goldstein.

27
00:02:06,434 --> 00:02:08,478
I've come to the East Coast.

28
00:02:08,561 --> 00:02:10,897
Do you know who knows
a Brett Goldstein?

29
00:02:11,898 --> 00:02:13,483
Everyone.

30
00:02:14,317 --> 00:02:16,194
Everyone knows
a Brett Goldstein.

31
00:02:16,277 --> 00:02:19,823
And not just that, but, apparently,
Brett Goldstein is the name

32
00:02:19,906 --> 00:02:23,702
of the guy who first fingered you
at summer camp.

33
00:02:27,831 --> 00:02:29,082
So...

34
00:02:30,291 --> 00:02:33,420
...just here to continue a great
and important tradition.

35
00:02:33,503 --> 00:02:35,088
Thank you for having me.

36
00:02:36,798 --> 00:02:39,509
I first came out to America
a few years ago, right?

37
00:02:39,592 --> 00:02:41,636
And I first came out here to do stand-up.

38
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:44,848
But I didn't know if I would fit in
with the American comedy scene.

39
00:02:44,931 --> 00:02:48,226
So I was in LA. I took myself
to the Comedy Store just to watch a show.

40
00:02:48,309 --> 00:02:50,020
I wanted to see what it was like.

41
00:02:50,103 --> 00:02:54,065
And all the acts that I saw,
they were all brilliant,

42
00:02:54,149 --> 00:02:58,028
but the level of confidence

43
00:02:58,111 --> 00:03:00,113
was odd.

44
00:03:01,322 --> 00:03:05,535
Like, everyone comes out onstage like,
what's up, bitches?

45
00:03:06,536 --> 00:03:09,956
And then they all do
this weird sort of racial profiling.

46
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:13,543
They go, what's up, bitches?
Where my Peruvians at?

47
00:03:19,758 --> 00:03:22,552
And, like, I'm English, right?

48
00:03:22,635 --> 00:03:25,138
So I do stand-up like I do sex.

49
00:03:25,221 --> 00:03:30,143
My true instinct is to come out onstage
and go, sorry.

50
00:03:33,021 --> 00:03:35,356
Thank you so much for letting me do this.

51
00:03:36,566 --> 00:03:38,777
I promise it won't take long.

52
00:03:40,153 --> 00:03:42,363
I'll just put my head down.
We'll plow through.

53
00:03:43,156 --> 00:03:45,992
No, we don't have to make eye contact.
I'm as embarrassed as you are.

54
00:03:46,993 --> 00:03:48,119
You don't have to pay me.

55
00:03:48,203 --> 00:03:50,371
I'm just so grateful
you're letting me do it.

56
00:03:50,997 --> 00:03:52,415
I will pay you.

57
00:03:52,499 --> 00:03:54,000
That's too much, too far.

58
00:03:54,834 --> 00:03:57,087
But now I've toured all over your country.

59
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:59,380
I've seen all the sights now.

60
00:03:59,464 --> 00:04:02,300
I saw a man masturbating

61
00:04:02,383 --> 00:04:04,302
outside a CVS

62
00:04:04,385 --> 00:04:07,514
on a sunny Tuesday afternoon.

63
00:04:07,597 --> 00:04:09,599
But I've also seen bad things.

64
00:04:12,602 --> 00:04:14,312
I've been everywhere now.
I've seen all the things.

65
00:04:14,395 --> 00:04:17,816
I've been to the White House,
as I'm sure we all have.

66
00:04:18,817 --> 00:04:20,318
It was a couple of years ago.

67
00:04:20,401 --> 00:04:22,529
You might not know this,
but the people from "Ted Lasso"

68
00:04:22,612 --> 00:04:24,405
were invited to the White House.

69
00:04:25,406 --> 00:04:26,407
Yeah.

70
00:04:27,826 --> 00:04:32,205
It was a different time,
different White House cast.

71
00:04:33,623 --> 00:04:35,542
You remember when there
was that White House cast,

72
00:04:35,625 --> 00:04:38,336
then there was a different cast,
and then the old cast got a new season?

73
00:04:38,419 --> 00:04:42,382
Anyway, it was the middle cast,
and it was a big deal.

74
00:04:42,465 --> 00:04:43,758
We were invited.

75
00:04:43,842 --> 00:04:46,928
But one thing I didn't know
is that because of taxpayers...

76
00:04:47,637 --> 00:04:48,847
Well done...

77
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:52,976
They don't really give
proper food or drink to guests

78
00:04:53,059 --> 00:04:57,272
because it's a waste of taxpayer money,
which is very honorable.

79
00:04:57,355 --> 00:05:00,400
I just wish they'd told us that
in advance,

80
00:05:00,483 --> 00:05:03,987
because I didn't eat or drink
at all beforehand

81
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:07,866
because I assumed we were going
to live like kings.

82
00:05:08,658 --> 00:05:12,036
Which I do appreciate is
the exact opposite reason

83
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,329
for that building existing.

84
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:20,086
We were there nine hours.

85
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:23,173
Hour eight, I was sat with the president,
going, are you sure?

86
00:05:23,256 --> 00:05:25,258
Just a thimble of water?

87
00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:27,886
Please, sir.

88
00:05:28,386 --> 00:05:30,597
Let me Uber Eats.

89
00:05:34,642 --> 00:05:37,103
What else did I want to tell you
that's relatable?

90
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,024
You know...

91
00:05:41,107 --> 00:05:42,275
Thank you.

92
00:05:43,359 --> 00:05:45,904
You know when you're
on "Sesame Street," right?

93
00:05:46,696 --> 00:05:48,198
We've all done it. We've all done it.

94
00:05:48,281 --> 00:05:52,619
So I did an episode of "Sesame Street,"
and I say this without irony.

95
00:05:52,702 --> 00:05:56,456
This is not a joke.
I mean this with every bone in my body.

96
00:05:56,539 --> 00:05:59,334
It was the best day of my life...

97
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,965
...which is all well and good,

98
00:06:06,049 --> 00:06:09,219
but I have had
to continue living ever since.

99
00:06:09,302 --> 00:06:10,845
And if I'm completely honest,

100
00:06:10,929 --> 00:06:14,015
I do find myself most days
at some point, going,

101
00:06:14,098 --> 00:06:16,517
I mean, what's
the fucking point anymore?

102
00:06:17,143 --> 00:06:19,646
When I did "Sesame Street,"
people said to me,

103
00:06:19,729 --> 00:06:21,272
oh, it doesn't get better than that.

104
00:06:21,356 --> 00:06:24,734
I then went to the White House.
It doesn't get better than that.

105
00:06:25,443 --> 00:06:28,321
Like, yes, I met the president,
but he's not Big Bird.

106
00:06:29,322 --> 00:06:32,075
And I truly worry

107
00:06:32,158 --> 00:06:34,661
that if I ever have a kid

108
00:06:34,744 --> 00:06:37,664
and one day my kid says to me,

109
00:06:37,747 --> 00:06:40,333
was the day I was born...

110
00:06:41,292 --> 00:06:44,337
...the best day of your life?

111
00:06:44,963 --> 00:06:47,340
I'll be like, no.

112
00:06:48,967 --> 00:06:50,969
Obviously not.

113
00:06:51,719 --> 00:06:54,347
Have you met fucking Elmo?

114
00:06:55,765 --> 00:06:57,684
'Cause I have,

115
00:06:57,767 --> 00:07:00,186
you arrogant piece of shit.

116
00:07:00,979 --> 00:07:03,481
And if Joe Biden had
had Flamin' Hot Cheetos,

117
00:07:03,564 --> 00:07:05,191
you'd be number three.

118
00:07:12,031 --> 00:07:14,909
Interesting thing
about doing "Sesame Street"--

119
00:07:14,993 --> 00:07:16,202
hell of a sentence.

120
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:21,291
Interesting thing--when I did it,
I had in my head who would be my favorite,

121
00:07:21,374 --> 00:07:23,334
but when I actually did it,
they were not my favorite.

122
00:07:23,418 --> 00:07:25,920
My favorite turned out
to be Cookie Monster.

123
00:07:26,004 --> 00:07:27,505
Wasn't expecting it.

124
00:07:27,588 --> 00:07:29,632
Cookie Monster really took me by surprise.

125
00:07:29,716 --> 00:07:31,217
I was like, fucking hell, you're funny.

126
00:07:32,593 --> 00:07:35,471
And on the way home, I was like,
why did I love Cookie Monster so much?

127
00:07:35,555 --> 00:07:36,931
And then I thought about it,
and I was like,

128
00:07:37,015 --> 00:07:41,394
oh, it's because Cookie Monster
is an addict.

129
00:07:41,477 --> 00:07:45,440
But we are meeting him
at the point of addiction

130
00:07:45,523 --> 00:07:47,608
where he's still fun.

131
00:07:51,404 --> 00:07:53,948
Like, in a few months,

132
00:07:54,032 --> 00:07:56,242
you don't want to be hanging out
with Cookie.

133
00:07:56,868 --> 00:07:59,912
Cookie is a fucking nightmare very soon.

134
00:07:59,996 --> 00:08:02,915
But right now he's, like, peak Cookie,
you know what I mean?

135
00:08:02,999 --> 00:08:07,337
Like, I truly think they should do
an intervention episode of "Sesame Street"

136
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:09,881
where, like,
Big Bird goes back to his nest,

137
00:08:09,964 --> 00:08:12,258
and the cash from underneath it
is missing.

138
00:08:12,967 --> 00:08:15,053
There's, like, a cookie-crumb trail.

139
00:08:15,887 --> 00:08:18,765
And Cookie Monster goes into the kitchen
and turns on the light,

140
00:08:18,848 --> 00:08:20,099
and they're all lined up.

141
00:08:20,183 --> 00:08:23,269
And Elmo is like, Elmo
thinks you have a problem.

142
00:08:27,065 --> 00:08:29,275
I should have said this at the top.

143
00:08:30,276 --> 00:08:31,861
I love your country.

144
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:35,073
You have to say that.
I love your country.

145
00:08:35,948 --> 00:08:37,283
Yep. Okay.

146
00:08:39,786 --> 00:08:42,080
I love your country. No notes.

147
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:47,668
No notes.
Everything seems well.

148
00:08:50,004 --> 00:08:51,297
No notes.

149
00:08:56,594 --> 00:09:00,223
One note, just one note,
but it's very, very small.

150
00:09:00,306 --> 00:09:02,308
Everything else is perfect.
I wouldn't change a thing.

151
00:09:03,017 --> 00:09:06,312
My only note, and it's a very small one,
and I'm sure this is cultural.

152
00:09:07,522 --> 00:09:11,567
I don't understand
your restroom situation.

153
00:09:11,651 --> 00:09:13,820
Now, call me old-fashioned,

154
00:09:13,903 --> 00:09:17,949
but I don't want to see you taking a shit.

155
00:09:18,032 --> 00:09:21,411
I don't understand why your stall doors

156
00:09:21,494 --> 00:09:25,873
cover the torso but nothing else.

157
00:09:25,957 --> 00:09:30,753
So you can see dick and balls
and poo and face,

158
00:09:30,837 --> 00:09:33,256
but not the chest because
that would be disgusting.

159
00:09:33,339 --> 00:09:34,757
No, you're right.

160
00:09:34,841 --> 00:09:36,426
And if that's not enough, don't panic,

161
00:09:36,509 --> 00:09:41,055
because there is also always
a giant vertical gap all the way down

162
00:09:41,139 --> 00:09:43,266
so you definitely get to see everything.

163
00:09:43,349 --> 00:09:44,642
Every restroom I walk in,

164
00:09:44,725 --> 00:09:46,686
I'm making eye contact
with a man straining.

165
00:09:48,354 --> 00:09:50,565
You all right, mate?
Looks like you need more fiber.

166
00:09:50,648 --> 00:09:51,732
You okay?

167
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:54,819
And very occasionally, you get lucky,

168
00:09:54,902 --> 00:09:57,572
and you get those restrooms
where it's, like, a room,

169
00:09:57,655 --> 00:09:59,407
and it has walls and a door.

170
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:02,994
But those toilets always have
a lock that's just a button

171
00:10:03,077 --> 00:10:04,537
that you press.

172
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:07,457
And you have no idea
if that now means it's locked.

173
00:10:08,249 --> 00:10:11,544
And the toilet is always so far away.

174
00:10:12,336 --> 00:10:15,465
You're always like, is it safe?
Is it safe?

175
00:10:15,548 --> 00:10:19,218
And the only way to check if it
is locked is to unlock it.

176
00:10:19,302 --> 00:10:20,428
So...

177
00:10:21,179 --> 00:10:23,848
...it's either permanently locked
or permanently unlocked.

178
00:10:23,931 --> 00:10:26,392
It's like trying to do Schrodinger's shit.

179
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:30,730
In England, when we need a number two,

180
00:10:30,813 --> 00:10:33,733
we go inside a bank vault in a submarine

181
00:10:33,816 --> 00:10:35,568
under the River Thames...

182
00:10:36,402 --> 00:10:38,779
...as Winston Churchill intended.

183
00:10:46,621 --> 00:10:48,581
Two notes, just two notes.

184
00:10:49,665 --> 00:10:52,210
Everything else is perfect.
I wouldn't change a thing, I swear.

185
00:10:52,793 --> 00:10:55,213
It's a small note,
and I'm sure this is cultural.

186
00:10:56,214 --> 00:10:57,924
I hope you don't take this the wrong way,

187
00:10:58,007 --> 00:11:02,929
but I find the way
that Americans finish phone calls

188
00:11:03,012 --> 00:11:06,015
to be aggressive and abrupt.

189
00:11:06,807 --> 00:11:08,142
In England,

190
00:11:08,226 --> 00:11:10,895
it takes about 25 minutes
to finish a phone call.

191
00:11:10,978 --> 00:11:12,271
We finish phone calls like this.

192
00:11:12,355 --> 00:11:13,940
Thank you very much.
Lovely talking to you again.

193
00:11:14,023 --> 00:11:15,525
Lots of love to everyone.
Yeah, good stuff.

194
00:11:15,608 --> 00:11:17,151
Yeah, we'll speak tomorrow.
Yeah, lots of love to everyone.

195
00:11:17,235 --> 00:11:18,945
Well done on everything.
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, okay.

196
00:11:19,028 --> 00:11:21,155
No, good night to you, sir.
Yes, okay. Lots of love.

197
00:11:21,239 --> 00:11:22,949
Yeah, thank you very much.
Yeah, it was a good chat.

198
00:11:23,032 --> 00:11:24,534
Yeah, thank you very much.
Thank you. Lots of love.

199
00:11:24,617 --> 00:11:26,327
Okay, thank you, thank you.
Okay, thank you. Goodbye.

200
00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:29,830
In America, you get
the information, you go, yep.

201
00:11:33,042 --> 00:11:35,795
Every time I have a phone call
with an American, it ends,

202
00:11:35,878 --> 00:11:38,256
and I think I've done
something terribly wrong.

203
00:11:39,006 --> 00:11:42,009
I immediately text them--are we okay?

204
00:11:42,093 --> 00:11:44,971
And they'll always write back,
all good, period, no kiss.

205
00:11:45,054 --> 00:11:47,139
I'm like, fuck.

206
00:11:47,223 --> 00:11:49,559
It's worse than I thought.

207
00:11:49,642 --> 00:11:51,686
I'll text back--are we breaking up?

208
00:11:51,769 --> 00:11:54,939
They'll be like, I'm your accountant.
What are you talking about?

209
00:11:55,022 --> 00:11:57,483
I'm like, well, why are
you being such a cunt?

210
00:11:59,527 --> 00:12:01,404
Oh, dear.

211
00:12:01,487 --> 00:12:04,949
Oh, dear. Oh, dear.
Let's deal with what just happened.

212
00:12:05,032 --> 00:12:07,952
I just very casually said the C-word.

213
00:12:08,035 --> 00:12:10,413
Now, when I arrived at the airport,

214
00:12:10,496 --> 00:12:13,416
I was told I might be deported
if I did that,

215
00:12:13,499 --> 00:12:16,877
because, apparently, Americans
think that is a bad word.

216
00:12:16,961 --> 00:12:20,089
May we be big and brave
and talk about this?

217
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:29,307
What the fuck is wrong with you cunts?

218
00:12:30,474 --> 00:12:33,352
Cunt is my favorite part on a human being.

219
00:12:33,436 --> 00:12:35,271
Why aren't you celebrating it?

220
00:12:39,859 --> 00:12:43,154
In England, we use that word
for everything.

221
00:12:43,237 --> 00:12:45,281
Like, yes, I can make it sound nasty,

222
00:12:45,364 --> 00:12:46,949
like, who's this cunt?

223
00:12:47,033 --> 00:12:49,118
But, like, if I see my best friend,

224
00:12:49,201 --> 00:12:51,829
I'm like, cunt,

225
00:12:51,912 --> 00:12:54,707
because I love him, you know what I mean?

226
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:56,417
And there's so much nuance to it.

227
00:12:56,500 --> 00:13:00,254
You can use it in so many circumstances.
It's like snowflakes to Inuits.

228
00:13:00,338 --> 00:13:03,758
It's like, imagine you've been
on a night out with the girls,

229
00:13:03,841 --> 00:13:06,719
and you come home and your husband's
finally emptied the dishwasher.

230
00:13:06,802 --> 00:13:09,013
And he leaves you a note
saying, you're welcome,

231
00:13:09,096 --> 00:13:11,557
and you're like, you little cunt.

232
00:13:13,684 --> 00:13:17,271
Or, like, when you finally meet
your wife's friend Sven,

233
00:13:17,355 --> 00:13:21,067
who she's been playing
all that tennis with,
but she promised you
he was gay.

234
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:24,153
But when you finally meet him,
you're like, this cunt.

235
00:13:27,573 --> 00:13:30,660
I hope it is now becoming clear
why I've actually been doing this tour.

236
00:13:30,743 --> 00:13:33,746
I am trying to bring "cunt"
to America.

237
00:13:38,167 --> 00:13:39,752
It's actually important work.

238
00:13:40,586 --> 00:13:43,381
I did want to call
this show "The Cunt Mission."

239
00:13:44,298 --> 00:13:47,760
But I was heavily advised against it
by everyone I know.

240
00:13:49,136 --> 00:13:52,056
It's a bit like the phrase
"the state of it."

241
00:13:52,139 --> 00:13:53,641
I don't know
if you have that here.

242
00:13:53,724 --> 00:13:55,351
My dad...

243
00:13:57,186 --> 00:13:58,938
He won't mind me saying this.

244
00:13:59,021 --> 00:14:00,981
We're filming it. He'll be proud.

245
00:14:02,191 --> 00:14:05,403
My dad is a massive pervert, and...

246
00:14:06,529 --> 00:14:09,240
...if you ever meet my dad
and you're out with him,

247
00:14:09,323 --> 00:14:12,618
he will just point out
attractive women all night.

248
00:14:12,702 --> 00:14:15,413
And he'll go, fucking hell.

249
00:14:16,497 --> 00:14:18,624
Fucking hell.

250
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:21,210
Look at the state of it.

251
00:14:23,421 --> 00:14:25,798
Nine months later, I was born.

252
00:14:33,139 --> 00:14:35,516
Three notes, just three notes.

253
00:14:35,599 --> 00:14:37,810
Everything else is perfect.
I wouldn't change a thing.

254
00:14:37,893 --> 00:14:40,438
And it's a very small note,
and I'm sure it's cultural.

255
00:14:42,231 --> 00:14:44,859
As wonderful as it is here--
and it is truly wonderful--

256
00:14:44,942 --> 00:14:46,944
I think, if we're honest,

257
00:14:47,027 --> 00:14:51,157
sometimes it does feel a bit edgy.

258
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:54,368
Like, I don't always feel safe.

259
00:14:54,452 --> 00:14:55,453
And...

260
00:14:56,704 --> 00:14:59,749
I had this experience in New York.
I'm sure you'll be able to relate to this.

261
00:14:59,832 --> 00:15:01,959
It was a few days ago, right?
I was out with a friend.

262
00:15:02,042 --> 00:15:04,587
It was about half 12:00 at night,
and I said goodbye.

263
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:06,464
And I got the subway back to my hotel.

264
00:15:06,547 --> 00:15:08,966
And the subway was
really packed, really busy.

265
00:15:09,049 --> 00:15:11,719
And the train I was on
pulled into a station,

266
00:15:11,802 --> 00:15:14,972
and everyone got off my carriage,

267
00:15:15,055 --> 00:15:18,476
except for me and one other person.

268
00:15:19,643 --> 00:15:22,480
And as the doors closed,
I had the overwhelming urge

269
00:15:22,563 --> 00:15:24,690
to turn to that person and go...

270
00:15:25,274 --> 00:15:28,110
...I'm gonna fucking kill you now.

271
00:15:35,659 --> 00:15:39,872
I mean, I didn't, but I felt it,
and it was powerful.

272
00:15:40,623 --> 00:15:43,083
I thought, maybe I've been here too long.

273
00:15:45,961 --> 00:15:49,006
This next bit, I don't actually have
a segue for,

274
00:15:49,089 --> 00:15:50,758
so I'll just take a pause.

275
00:15:57,807 --> 00:15:59,517
My mum is really hot.

276
00:16:01,268 --> 00:16:02,645
I have a hot mum.

277
00:16:02,728 --> 00:16:05,689
I have a hot, sexy, curvy, gorgeous mama.

278
00:16:05,773 --> 00:16:07,358
Tell us why you're in therapy, Brett.

279
00:16:07,441 --> 00:16:09,443
I have a...

280
00:16:09,527 --> 00:16:13,489
I have a hot, sexy, curvy,
sexy, curvy, gorgeous mama.

281
00:16:13,572 --> 00:16:17,243
And, listen, do not be creeped out
by me saying this.

282
00:16:17,326 --> 00:16:18,702
These are not my words.

283
00:16:18,786 --> 00:16:23,040
These are the words of every single person
who has ever met my mum.

284
00:16:23,123 --> 00:16:24,834
What happens is, people meet my mum.

285
00:16:24,917 --> 00:16:27,461
Then they come to me, and they go,
oh, my God, I just met your mom.

286
00:16:27,545 --> 00:16:29,129
She's so hot.

287
00:16:30,256 --> 00:16:32,466
And to this day,

288
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:36,679
I do not know what I am meant to say

289
00:16:36,762 --> 00:16:38,806
in response.

290
00:16:38,889 --> 00:16:40,933
Am I meant to go...

291
00:16:43,143 --> 00:16:44,562
...yeah!

292
00:16:45,729 --> 00:16:48,148
Fucking right she is!

293
00:16:48,774 --> 00:16:51,569
I've seen her naked, mate!

294
00:16:52,903 --> 00:16:55,865
She might have stopped working,
but those titties haven't.

295
00:16:55,948 --> 00:16:58,450
High five, high five, high five!

296
00:16:58,534 --> 00:17:01,370
I've been inside her.
You know what I mean?

297
00:17:03,581 --> 00:17:04,957
Oh, no.

298
00:17:08,002 --> 00:17:11,797
Oh, what a shame. I'm so sorry.
We were having such a classy evening.

299
00:17:12,590 --> 00:17:14,008
What a shame.

300
00:17:14,091 --> 00:17:16,093
It honestly happens
to me so much

301
00:17:16,176 --> 00:17:19,513
that when people say it to me
whose mum is not hot,

302
00:17:19,597 --> 00:17:20,890
I'm like, am I meant to go,

303
00:17:20,973 --> 00:17:23,601
and your mother
has a cracking personality?

304
00:17:26,979 --> 00:17:30,691
You're a good crowd, New Jersey.
You're a good crowd, and you seem...

305
00:17:35,446 --> 00:17:38,824
I'm also vaguely distracted
by a child?

306
00:17:39,617 --> 00:17:41,201
In the front row?

307
00:17:41,911 --> 00:17:42,912
Are you a child?

308
00:17:43,746 --> 00:17:45,873
Are you a human child?
Yeah.

309
00:17:45,956 --> 00:17:48,250
How old is this child?
12.

310
00:17:48,334 --> 00:17:51,629
You're 12. Okay. Well, you're gonna
learn so much, and...

311
00:17:55,925 --> 00:17:57,426
And I'm happy to see you.

312
00:17:58,093 --> 00:18:01,138
And when you talk to your therapist
about this one day,

313
00:18:01,221 --> 00:18:02,640
just remember I meant well.

314
00:18:05,851 --> 00:18:07,227
Thank you for being here.

315
00:18:11,649 --> 00:18:12,775
But you do seem intelligent,

316
00:18:12,858 --> 00:18:16,487
and you do seem like you can handle
the serious stuff.

317
00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:18,864
I mean, I guess that's why you come
to comedy, isn't it?

318
00:18:19,698 --> 00:18:22,159
We can talk about the serious stuff.
Fuck it.

319
00:18:22,242 --> 00:18:23,452
So, look...

320
00:18:24,244 --> 00:18:26,872
...been an awful lot going on
these last few years, right?

321
00:18:28,165 --> 00:18:30,793
We've had the pandemic.
We've had wars.

322
00:18:30,876 --> 00:18:34,463
And worse than all of that, we've had men.

323
00:18:36,131 --> 00:18:38,759
Men is bad.

324
00:18:38,842 --> 00:18:41,637
Men is bad.

325
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,639
Men is like, oh, boy.

326
00:18:43,722 --> 00:18:46,392
Like, men is bad.

327
00:18:46,475 --> 00:18:50,813
And I think I'm up to date on everything
with the Time's Up and the MeToo,

328
00:18:50,896 --> 00:18:53,065
and the "not you as well."

329
00:18:54,692 --> 00:18:57,403
And, look, here's the truth.
I don't mind sharing it with you.

330
00:18:57,486 --> 00:19:00,489
You all seem like smart people.
I'll tell you the fucking truth.

331
00:19:03,993 --> 00:19:08,038
I always knew that men were bad.

332
00:19:09,790 --> 00:19:12,710
I did, because we have
secret meetings on Tuesdays,

333
00:19:12,793 --> 00:19:16,547
and we brag about it at the CVS.

334
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:17,923
But...

335
00:19:19,675 --> 00:19:23,554
...I did not know that they were this bad
in this amount.

336
00:19:23,637 --> 00:19:26,015
And the more I read and the more I hear,

337
00:19:26,098 --> 00:19:29,476
the more I feel sort of embarrassed
when I introduce myself to people.

338
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:32,229
Like, I sort of want to go,
well, obviously, I'm a man,

339
00:19:32,312 --> 00:19:33,647
but I'm not...

340
00:19:33,731 --> 00:19:35,524
I'm not a man.

341
00:19:36,525 --> 00:19:41,321
And I realize it must be what it's like
to be German...

342
00:19:49,872 --> 00:19:53,292
...for the last 75 to 80 years,
because everyone you meet,

343
00:19:53,375 --> 00:19:56,253
you're going, well, see,
I'm German, but I'm not...

344
00:19:56,336 --> 00:19:57,796
I'm not a Nazi.

345
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:00,758
And everyone's going,
are you sure?

346
00:20:01,341 --> 00:20:03,677
Because you have got
blonde hair, blue eyes,

347
00:20:03,761 --> 00:20:05,554
and you are incredibly efficient.

348
00:20:05,637 --> 00:20:09,266
And you're like, no, no, no, no.
But I high-five straight up like normal.

349
00:20:09,349 --> 00:20:11,351
That's how you can tell.
It's in the high-fives.

350
00:20:12,811 --> 00:20:14,354
Just ask Elon.

351
00:20:23,113 --> 00:20:24,907
But it's like, it's getting worse.

352
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:27,701
Like, every day I read something.
Like, I feel like I'm on the wrong team.

353
00:20:27,785 --> 00:20:28,952
Like, it's embarrassing.

354
00:20:29,036 --> 00:20:32,081
Like, in Japan, some men
have started marrying pillows

355
00:20:32,164 --> 00:20:33,832
because they can't cope
with women.

356
00:20:33,916 --> 00:20:36,001
What the fuck is going on?

357
00:20:37,002 --> 00:20:40,714
And, look, I am very aware
that me even talking about this onstage

358
00:20:40,798 --> 00:20:43,133
is, in itself, problematic

359
00:20:43,217 --> 00:20:46,804
because, spoiler alert, I am a man.

360
00:20:46,887 --> 00:20:49,932
Some of you might be thinking,
what is he up to?

361
00:20:50,015 --> 00:20:52,226
What is this sick fuck's angle?

362
00:20:52,309 --> 00:20:55,604
Like, is this like Darth Vader
coming out here and going,

363
00:20:55,687 --> 00:20:57,106
Stormtroopers are bad.

364
00:20:57,189 --> 00:20:59,608
All back to the Death Star.
You're safe with me.

365
00:21:01,235 --> 00:21:03,821
That impression is not getting better.

366
00:21:06,115 --> 00:21:07,741
I've been working on that for six months.

367
00:21:07,825 --> 00:21:10,202
I would argue it's getting
worse and worse.

368
00:21:12,037 --> 00:21:13,747
But all this men stuff
is stressing me out.

369
00:21:13,831 --> 00:21:14,957
It's truly stressing me out.

370
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:18,127
And the more I speak to people about it,
the more I hear and the more I read,

371
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:21,130
I'm like, I don't think
there's a solution to this,

372
00:21:21,213 --> 00:21:22,965
other than I think...

373
00:21:23,048 --> 00:21:27,386
I think you're gonna have to kill
all the men.

374
00:21:27,469 --> 00:21:29,471
And it doesn't have to be nasty.

375
00:21:29,555 --> 00:21:31,181
It does not have to be ugly.

376
00:21:31,265 --> 00:21:34,726
You just get a load of porn
and sex robots and pillows,

377
00:21:34,810 --> 00:21:37,563
chuck them in the ocean,
and the men will just file in,

378
00:21:37,646 --> 00:21:39,064
one after the other.

379
00:21:40,274 --> 00:21:42,985
And, look, I am saying this publicly

380
00:21:43,068 --> 00:21:45,571
because I do hope
that when you enact this cull,

381
00:21:45,654 --> 00:21:48,073
you will keep me around as a mascot.

382
00:21:49,825 --> 00:21:51,994
And I'll be very good.
I will cook, and I will clean.

383
00:21:52,077 --> 00:21:53,787
And you won't hear a word out of me.

384
00:21:53,871 --> 00:21:56,874
And if at some point
in your new society of only women

385
00:21:56,957 --> 00:21:59,793
you do decide you want to procreate,
obviously, I'm not gonna get sex.

386
00:21:59,877 --> 00:22:01,170
Wouldn't want it, wouldn't ask for it.

387
00:22:01,253 --> 00:22:04,089
But if you do want to procreate,
just give me a nod,

388
00:22:04,173 --> 00:22:07,092
and I'll leave a little pot of cum
in a safe space.

389
00:22:12,973 --> 00:22:16,727
Interesting discovery
being English in your country...

390
00:22:16,810 --> 00:22:19,897
I can say "little pot of cum"...

391
00:22:20,898 --> 00:22:22,900
...and you think it's charming.

392
00:22:25,277 --> 00:22:28,488
"Little pot of cum" in an English accent
sounds like a kids' book.

393
00:22:29,698 --> 00:22:31,909
"The Little Pot of Cum Who Could."

394
00:22:32,826 --> 00:22:34,995
That bit doesn't work
with an American accent.

395
00:22:35,078 --> 00:22:36,622
Like, I leave her a little pot of cum.

396
00:22:36,705 --> 00:22:38,123
You're like, oh, God!

397
00:22:38,916 --> 00:22:40,250
Please don't do that, sir.

398
00:22:40,334 --> 00:22:42,711
Please, no, keep your cum
to yourself, young man.

399
00:22:44,129 --> 00:22:47,257
I've never seen "Downton Abbey,"
but I know it's huge over here.

400
00:22:47,341 --> 00:22:51,136
I just assume every episode is like,
Your Lordship, little pot of cum?

401
00:22:53,096 --> 00:22:56,141
What shall we take for Thanksgiving?
Little pot of cum?

402
00:22:57,684 --> 00:22:59,519
The christening soon--Never mind.

403
00:23:04,733 --> 00:23:07,653
But I think toxic masculinity is real.
I think it's a real thing.

404
00:23:07,736 --> 00:23:10,864
I think it comes, certainly,
from men of my generation and above.

405
00:23:10,948 --> 00:23:12,658
It's because we were raised
not to be open,

406
00:23:12,741 --> 00:23:15,202
not to be vulnerable,
that that's bad, that that's weak.

407
00:23:15,285 --> 00:23:17,537
So one of the only things
we can do to combat that is,

408
00:23:17,621 --> 00:23:19,915
I think we all need to learn
how to share more.

409
00:23:19,998 --> 00:23:23,585
But you ever shared
something with a friend,

410
00:23:23,669 --> 00:23:25,712
and then they've shared something back,

411
00:23:25,796 --> 00:23:30,092
and then you thought, my God,
I wish we'd never shared?

412
00:23:33,053 --> 00:23:35,264
Because I have a ex-friend.

413
00:23:35,347 --> 00:23:39,601
I have an ex-friend
because of our little sharing session.

414
00:23:39,685 --> 00:23:41,103
There's a guy I've known all my life.

415
00:23:41,186 --> 00:23:43,272
I went to school with him,
so we grew up together.

416
00:23:43,355 --> 00:23:45,482
He's like family.
I'd defend him to the death.

417
00:23:45,565 --> 00:23:47,484
If we met now,
we probably wouldn't be friends,

418
00:23:47,567 --> 00:23:49,278
but I grew up with him,
so he's like family.

419
00:23:49,361 --> 00:23:51,071
I'd defend him to the death.

420
00:23:51,154 --> 00:23:53,699
He's the sort of guy
you say has a heart of gold,

421
00:23:53,782 --> 00:23:57,995
which is a phrase you never use for people
who have a heart of gold.

422
00:23:58,578 --> 00:24:01,206
"Heart of gold" is a phrase
like, "can I be honest?"

423
00:24:01,999 --> 00:24:04,042
"Can I be honest?" never ends nice.

424
00:24:04,126 --> 00:24:06,420
"Can I be honest?"
never ends in "I love you."

425
00:24:06,503 --> 00:24:08,505
"Can I be honest?"
always ends with something like,

426
00:24:08,588 --> 00:24:11,591
"The sound of you eating
makes me want to kill myself."

427
00:24:13,719 --> 00:24:17,514
Anyway, friend from school,
known him all my life, heart of gold.

428
00:24:17,597 --> 00:24:20,142
And just a few years ago,
I have this kind of revelation.

429
00:24:20,225 --> 00:24:22,936
I'm like, we know nothing
about each other.

430
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:25,105
We actually know nothing.
We've grown up together.

431
00:24:25,188 --> 00:24:28,317
We never talk about anything.
And I said, should we try something?

432
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,526
I said, let's go out.

433
00:24:29,609 --> 00:24:33,322
We'll have a few drinks,
and let's try and sort of talk

434
00:24:33,405 --> 00:24:36,616
about how we feel and shit.

435
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:41,121
And he said, are you having
a nervous breakdown?

436
00:24:41,204 --> 00:24:43,457
And I said, we'll see.

437
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:45,751
And we went out.

438
00:24:45,834 --> 00:24:48,086
We had a few drinks, and I went first.

439
00:24:48,170 --> 00:24:50,297
I said something out loud
I'd never said before.

440
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:52,174
I was talking
about my girlfriend at the time,

441
00:24:52,257 --> 00:24:54,968
and I said, I think I love her.

442
00:24:55,052 --> 00:24:56,762
I feel like I love her.

443
00:24:56,845 --> 00:25:00,766
But when I'm out, I am attracted
to other people all the time.

444
00:25:00,849 --> 00:25:02,768
I don't know if that's natural,
that's human nature,

445
00:25:02,851 --> 00:25:04,936
or if that means
I don't actually love her.

446
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:06,980
And he said, yeah.

447
00:25:07,064 --> 00:25:08,565
He said, yeah.

448
00:25:08,648 --> 00:25:10,776
I know what you mean, actually.

449
00:25:10,859 --> 00:25:13,070
He said, sometimes...

450
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:16,198
...when it gets
a bit much with my wife,

451
00:25:16,281 --> 00:25:19,242
in my lunch break,
I'll go downtown,

452
00:25:19,326 --> 00:25:23,080
I'll go down an alley,
and I'll get sucked off by a whore.

453
00:25:39,638 --> 00:25:42,099
And I was like, yeah.

454
00:25:43,475 --> 00:25:46,103
Similar, similar...

455
00:25:47,312 --> 00:25:48,397
...similar stor--

456
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,774
I can see how my story
led to your story.

457
00:25:50,857 --> 00:25:52,651
Yeah, similar.

458
00:25:52,734 --> 00:25:56,571
And I thought, I actually
don't know what to say now.

459
00:25:56,655 --> 00:25:59,241
He's properly stumped me.

460
00:25:59,324 --> 00:26:00,742
Like, I probably shouldn't shame him.

461
00:26:00,826 --> 00:26:02,577
It's all that shame
sending him down alleys.

462
00:26:02,661 --> 00:26:05,664
But at the same time,
I have heard, as men,

463
00:26:05,747 --> 00:26:08,041
we are supposed to call each other out.

464
00:26:08,125 --> 00:26:10,252
So I said to him, look...

465
00:26:10,335 --> 00:26:11,503
mate...

466
00:26:12,337 --> 00:26:14,506
...we don't say "whore."

467
00:26:23,098 --> 00:26:24,141
So, look...

468
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:26,935
I worry...

469
00:26:27,853 --> 00:26:29,146
I worry...

470
00:26:31,231 --> 00:26:32,941
I worry...

471
00:26:33,942 --> 00:26:37,154
...that my fear of embarrassment...

472
00:26:38,155 --> 00:26:42,075
...is far greater than my instinct

473
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:43,743
to save a life.

474
00:26:49,749 --> 00:26:53,712
Where I live, there's this dog
that lives in my road.

475
00:26:53,795 --> 00:26:55,881
And I really like this dog.
It's a good dog. Good dog.

476
00:26:55,964 --> 00:26:57,799
It doesn't live in the road.
Like, it is housed.

477
00:26:57,883 --> 00:26:59,885
Like, it has a roommate.
It lives with this woman.

478
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:02,095
But sometimes the dog will be in the road.

479
00:27:02,179 --> 00:27:04,097
And I really like this dog.
It's a good dog. It's a good dog.

480
00:27:04,181 --> 00:27:07,100
So, whenever I see the dog,
I will stop, and I will--

481
00:27:07,184 --> 00:27:08,685
- What word do you say?
- Pet.

482
00:27:08,768 --> 00:27:10,896
Pet. You say, pet, right, yeah?

483
00:27:10,979 --> 00:27:13,398
Here is my question for you all.

484
00:27:13,482 --> 00:27:16,401
Did you all just run out of verbs?

485
00:27:17,068 --> 00:27:19,404
Like, it is a pet.

486
00:27:23,909 --> 00:27:26,786
You're not dogging your dog,
you know what I mean?

487
00:27:27,787 --> 00:27:29,706
It makes it sound so creepy.

488
00:27:29,789 --> 00:27:32,042
Like, do you want to go out
to the farm and pig the pigs?

489
00:27:32,125 --> 00:27:34,211
No, thank you, Americans.
Thank you.

490
00:27:35,003 --> 00:27:36,421
So gross.

491
00:27:37,881 --> 00:27:39,716
So, anyway, I like this dog,
so whenever I see the dog,

492
00:27:39,799 --> 00:27:41,343
I will stop, and I will stroke it.

493
00:27:41,426 --> 00:27:42,802
That sounds worse.

494
00:27:44,930 --> 00:27:46,723
That's wor--Oh, no, look, whenever...

495
00:27:46,806 --> 00:27:49,351
I'll stop, and I will touch it.

496
00:27:49,434 --> 00:27:50,435
No.

497
00:27:51,853 --> 00:27:53,772
I will scruffle it up.

498
00:27:53,855 --> 00:27:56,107
Like, I will get my hands on that dog.

499
00:27:56,191 --> 00:27:57,984
No, you don't--
Like, I'm not--

500
00:28:00,237 --> 00:28:02,072
Don't look at me like that.

501
00:28:02,155 --> 00:28:03,949
I don't want the takeaway
of this show being,

502
00:28:04,032 --> 00:28:06,826
he can't do impressions,
and I think he fucked a dog.

503
00:28:08,036 --> 00:28:09,746
There's nothing going on between me and--

504
00:28:09,829 --> 00:28:12,749
It's platonic between me and the dog,
to be clear, all right?

505
00:28:12,832 --> 00:28:14,459
At least for myself.
I can't speak for the dog.

506
00:28:14,543 --> 00:28:15,752
I'm not putting words in the dog's--

507
00:28:15,835 --> 00:28:18,046
I'm not putting anything
in the dog's mouth, okay?

508
00:28:19,047 --> 00:28:21,550
Can't a man and a dog be friends
without the sex part getting in the way?

509
00:28:21,633 --> 00:28:24,386
I believe so, yes.
All right?

510
00:28:24,469 --> 00:28:27,264
So, whenever I see this dog,
I will stop,

511
00:28:27,347 --> 00:28:28,765
and I will wave, all right?

512
00:28:28,848 --> 00:28:30,684
I just wave from afar.

513
00:28:30,767 --> 00:28:33,770
And one day, I'm out in the street,
and I see the dog with the woman,

514
00:28:33,853 --> 00:28:35,564
and I stop and have a chat
with the woman, not the dog.

515
00:28:35,647 --> 00:28:37,899
And the woman says,
I've got to run an errand.

516
00:28:37,983 --> 00:28:40,110
Are you around for a bit?
Do you want to take the dog for a walk?

517
00:28:40,193 --> 00:28:41,403
And I said, I'd love to.

518
00:28:41,486 --> 00:28:43,989
And it was the first time
I'd been alone with the dog,

519
00:28:44,072 --> 00:28:46,491
which I am absolutely allowed to be.

520
00:28:47,284 --> 00:28:48,743
I have a certificate.

521
00:28:48,827 --> 00:28:51,496
And I have the dog on a lead.

522
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,873
And I walk the dog to the park.

523
00:28:54,624 --> 00:28:56,876
And I go right into the middle
of the park.

524
00:28:57,877 --> 00:29:00,171
And then I took the lead off.

525
00:29:00,255 --> 00:29:03,800
And the dog immediately bolted

526
00:29:03,883 --> 00:29:06,845
straight towards the main road.

527
00:29:06,928 --> 00:29:09,389
And there was, like,
loads of people around.

528
00:29:09,472 --> 00:29:11,891
And I thought like, oh, like--

529
00:29:11,975 --> 00:29:13,310
I don't want to make a scene.

530
00:29:13,393 --> 00:29:15,812
Like, one of my biggest fears

531
00:29:15,895 --> 00:29:19,608
is becoming a GIF that gets passed around,
like, fucking hell!

532
00:29:19,691 --> 00:29:20,900
You know what I mean?

533
00:29:22,152 --> 00:29:24,321
So I thought...

534
00:29:25,322 --> 00:29:27,324
I thought, I'm just gonna let it die.

535
00:29:29,701 --> 00:29:32,454
I thought I'd just have to say to her,
oh, the car came out of nowhere,

536
00:29:32,537 --> 00:29:33,788
but it didn't.

537
00:29:33,872 --> 00:29:36,708
It's a very straight road.
I saw it about a quarter of a mile away.

538
00:29:37,459 --> 00:29:38,627
Oh, I didn't hear it coming.

539
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:41,087
It wasn't electric.
It was a gas-guzzling machine.

540
00:29:42,172 --> 00:29:46,134
And it really made me think,
I actually must not have children...

541
00:29:47,344 --> 00:29:50,305
...because if I ever had, like,
a dickhead kid,

542
00:29:50,388 --> 00:29:53,058
if I ever had, like, a real dickhead kid

543
00:29:53,141 --> 00:29:55,435
and I was out with my dickhead kid

544
00:29:55,518 --> 00:29:58,313
and my dickhead kid
was causing chaos somewhere

545
00:29:58,396 --> 00:29:59,898
and someone was like, whose is this?

546
00:29:59,981 --> 00:30:01,149
I'd be like...

547
00:30:03,943 --> 00:30:05,737
I don't know.
He seems awful.

548
00:30:06,821 --> 00:30:08,698
And you'd know it was mine.

549
00:30:08,782 --> 00:30:10,742
It would be so hairy.

550
00:30:12,869 --> 00:30:16,289
It's a little werewolf kid
running around like Eddie Munster.

551
00:30:16,373 --> 00:30:17,666
Are you sure you don't know him?

552
00:30:17,749 --> 00:30:19,292
Never seen him in my life.

553
00:30:19,376 --> 00:30:23,171
Why is he calling you "Daddy"?
Get off me, Brett Junior!

554
00:30:28,051 --> 00:30:29,761
Now, look, New Jersey...

555
00:30:31,179 --> 00:30:32,931
...I heard your noises,

556
00:30:33,014 --> 00:30:35,392
so I realized I'm going to have
to say this.

557
00:30:36,309 --> 00:30:39,187
Otherwise, you're not going to be able
to enjoy the rest of the show.

558
00:30:41,064 --> 00:30:43,608
The dog survived, all right?

559
00:30:44,984 --> 00:30:46,778
All right?
Yes.

560
00:30:48,405 --> 00:30:50,699
You think you're so tough,
but then you can't handle a story

561
00:30:50,782 --> 00:30:52,158
where a dog might have died.

562
00:30:52,242 --> 00:30:54,202
The dog is absolutely fine, okay?

563
00:30:54,285 --> 00:30:56,287
What really happened is,
the dog ran this way,

564
00:30:56,371 --> 00:30:58,623
and the dog ran that way,
and we had a lovely walk.

565
00:30:58,707 --> 00:31:01,459
And then I took the dog home,
and we made love, okay?

566
00:31:02,794 --> 00:31:05,213
It was a happy ending for both of us.

567
00:31:06,047 --> 00:31:08,341
Why do you think my child is so hairy?

568
00:31:08,425 --> 00:31:11,553
Unnecessary.
Unnecessary add-on.

569
00:31:11,636 --> 00:31:14,013
I'm so sorry.
We were having such a classy evening.

570
00:31:17,225 --> 00:31:18,768
What's that?

571
00:31:18,852 --> 00:31:20,228
My biceps?

572
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:24,149
Oh, yeah. No, I've been--

573
00:31:24,232 --> 00:31:25,567
Yeah, I've been working out, but--

574
00:31:25,650 --> 00:31:27,360
Well, I have to
because I've got to hold this for so long.

575
00:31:27,444 --> 00:31:28,611
Yeah.

576
00:31:28,695 --> 00:31:30,238
Well, we can talk about it if you want.

577
00:31:31,030 --> 00:31:32,824
All right.
Yeah, I go to the gym.

578
00:31:34,576 --> 00:31:36,286
I go to the gym.
Sorry about it.

579
00:31:36,369 --> 00:31:38,246
Yeah, I go to the gym.
I'll talk about it, fine.

580
00:31:39,539 --> 00:31:42,167
I go to the gym.
I go to the gym regularly.

581
00:31:42,250 --> 00:31:44,502
I go to the gym
for spiritual reasons, actually.

582
00:31:44,586 --> 00:31:47,046
I go because I would like
to look good naked.

583
00:31:48,298 --> 00:31:50,800
But, truthfully,
the gym that I go to...

584
00:31:50,884 --> 00:31:53,595
I don't actually like this gym.
I sort of hate it.

585
00:31:53,678 --> 00:31:55,722
I only go to it
because it's the nearest one.

586
00:31:55,805 --> 00:31:59,184
But it's a real sort
of testosterone-y gym,

587
00:31:59,267 --> 00:32:00,643
if that's not a pizza.

588
00:32:00,727 --> 00:32:04,981
It's like a real sort
of testosterone-y and cheese

589
00:32:05,064 --> 00:32:07,317
deep-dish gym,
you know what I mean?

590
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:09,986
Like, it's always sort of men
just fucking standing around,

591
00:32:10,069 --> 00:32:11,988
fucking moody, staring at each other.

592
00:32:12,071 --> 00:32:14,115
And all I ever want to use
is the weights machine,

593
00:32:14,199 --> 00:32:16,201
and there'll always be
someone on it for hours.

594
00:32:16,284 --> 00:32:18,620
And, eventually, I'll be like,
can I jump in on that?

595
00:32:18,703 --> 00:32:21,706
And they'll be like, fuck off.
And I'll be like, yeah, cool, cool, cool.

596
00:32:22,707 --> 00:32:25,293
I'll just keep doing
body-weight squats.

597
00:32:29,464 --> 00:32:31,508
But something happened
the other day at the gym.

598
00:32:31,591 --> 00:32:32,884
This is completely true.

599
00:32:32,967 --> 00:32:35,595
And this just shows you
the power of music.

600
00:32:35,678 --> 00:32:39,474
Now, I don't know if this was an accident,
someone did this deliberately,

601
00:32:39,557 --> 00:32:41,601
or the playlist was
just on random shuffle,

602
00:32:41,684 --> 00:32:45,104
but the song that was playing
in the gym was this...

603
00:32:48,066 --> 00:32:51,236
Everyone fucking menacing,
staring each other out,

604
00:32:51,319 --> 00:32:53,613
lifting weights,
looking fucking moody.

605
00:32:53,696 --> 00:32:57,116
And then the next song came on,
and it was this...

606
00:33:04,541 --> 00:33:07,544
And everything changed.

607
00:33:08,336 --> 00:33:12,131
I don't know if you've ever seen a man
lift weights wistfully.

608
00:33:13,591 --> 00:33:14,968
It's a thing.

609
00:33:15,051 --> 00:33:17,554
Man doing push-ups started weeping.

610
00:33:18,346 --> 00:33:20,723
Man on the treadmill
stopped doing hill sprints

611
00:33:20,807 --> 00:33:22,517
and started looking within.

612
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:25,645
And then the man by the weights machine
came over to me,

613
00:33:25,728 --> 00:33:28,147
and he went, sorry,
I've been so aggressive, bro.

614
00:33:28,231 --> 00:33:31,401
I think it's because my mum didn't give me
enough attention as a child.

615
00:33:32,235 --> 00:33:33,570
I said, I get that.

616
00:33:33,653 --> 00:33:35,071
He said, do you want
to use the weights?

617
00:33:35,154 --> 00:33:37,365
I said, let's use them together.

618
00:33:41,786 --> 00:33:42,954
Lovely.

619
00:33:44,289 --> 00:33:46,791
True story.
True story, word for word.

620
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:49,294
I guess the real weights

621
00:33:49,377 --> 00:33:51,588
were the friends
we made along the way.

622
00:33:53,047 --> 00:33:56,718
I did, actually, end up making friends
with one of these guys.

623
00:33:56,801 --> 00:34:00,305
You know, there's a thing
with men who work out at the gym.

624
00:34:00,388 --> 00:34:03,099
There's a bit I must miss
when people work out too much,

625
00:34:03,182 --> 00:34:07,312
where it sort of goes big,
bigger, pyramid, you know what I mean?

626
00:34:07,395 --> 00:34:10,732
Like, sort of, big,
bigger, human Toblerone.

627
00:34:10,815 --> 00:34:11,816
And...

628
00:34:13,902 --> 00:34:16,529
I made friends with one
of these Toblerone guys, right?

629
00:34:16,613 --> 00:34:21,117
And we used to chat a bit after a workout,
and then he disappeared for a few months.

630
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:22,201
Didn't see him.

631
00:34:22,285 --> 00:34:24,537
Then he came back, and I was like,
where have you been?

632
00:34:24,621 --> 00:34:28,541
And it turned out,
he had taken himself to China

633
00:34:28,625 --> 00:34:32,545
to train to become,
like, a Shaolin warrior or something.

634
00:34:32,629 --> 00:34:34,130
And he came back.
I said, how was it?

635
00:34:34,213 --> 00:34:37,717
He said, yeah, it was
fucking amazing, actually.

636
00:34:38,301 --> 00:34:40,178
They used to wake us
at 3:00 in the morning

637
00:34:40,261 --> 00:34:42,430
and beat us with sacks.

638
00:34:42,513 --> 00:34:44,641
I said, that sounds incredible.

639
00:34:45,725 --> 00:34:48,102
And he said, I can kick really high now.

640
00:34:48,186 --> 00:34:49,437
And I was like, cool.

641
00:34:51,439 --> 00:34:52,732
I said, how high can you kick?

642
00:34:52,815 --> 00:34:54,776
And he said, I could kick you
in the fucking head.

643
00:34:56,444 --> 00:34:58,655
Interesting unit of measurement.

644
00:35:00,949 --> 00:35:03,910
But he told me something
that I completely believed.

645
00:35:03,993 --> 00:35:06,579
He told me
that because he'd done this training,

646
00:35:06,663 --> 00:35:09,332
now, if he was ever in a bar or anywhere

647
00:35:09,415 --> 00:35:12,669
and someone were to start
a fight with him,

648
00:35:12,752 --> 00:35:14,796
that now, legally,

649
00:35:14,879 --> 00:35:18,341
he had to say three times

650
00:35:18,424 --> 00:35:21,052
that he was a lethal weapon...

651
00:35:22,053 --> 00:35:24,222
...before he could engage in combat.

652
00:35:26,057 --> 00:35:30,061
Nothing would escalate
a fight quicker...

653
00:35:32,105 --> 00:35:34,357
...than someone saying,
I'm a lethal weapon.

654
00:35:35,608 --> 00:35:38,194
What's that? Did you hear me?
Oh, yeah, we all heard you.

655
00:35:38,277 --> 00:35:41,072
Well, listen again. I'm a lethal weapon.

656
00:35:41,698 --> 00:35:42,740
Should we go outside?

657
00:35:42,824 --> 00:35:45,868
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
I'm a lethal weapon.

658
00:35:45,952 --> 00:35:49,539
What are you--
Douchebag Beetlejuice?

659
00:35:52,667 --> 00:35:56,421
But I actually believed him.
It kind of made sense to me.

660
00:35:56,504 --> 00:35:59,674
It's only recently it occurred to me
that if that is true,

661
00:35:59,757 --> 00:36:02,051
that means if one day he kills someone,

662
00:36:02,135 --> 00:36:05,054
then in a court of law,
the judge can just be like,

663
00:36:05,138 --> 00:36:06,222
excuse me, sir, can I check?

664
00:36:06,305 --> 00:36:08,474
Did you say you were
a lethal weapon three times?

665
00:36:08,558 --> 00:36:09,726
I did, yeah.

666
00:36:09,809 --> 00:36:12,437
Case dismissed. Not guilty.

667
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:15,523
She was asleep when I said it,
but I did say it.

668
00:36:20,069 --> 00:36:21,946
She's not real.

669
00:36:23,281 --> 00:36:25,324
The dog survived.

670
00:36:26,325 --> 00:36:28,745
When will you trust me?

671
00:36:32,707 --> 00:36:34,500
So, of all the issues
we have in the world,

672
00:36:34,584 --> 00:36:35,710
and we do have so many,

673
00:36:35,793 --> 00:36:37,837
if I may be sincere for a moment,

674
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:41,883
I think that we have one major issue
that all our other issues stem from,

675
00:36:41,966 --> 00:36:44,218
and that issue
is wealth inequality.

676
00:36:44,302 --> 00:36:46,554
I think the gap between rich
and poor is insane.

677
00:36:46,637 --> 00:36:48,097
It seems to be getting worse,

678
00:36:48,181 --> 00:36:50,391
and I think all of our problems
come from that.

679
00:36:50,475 --> 00:36:54,020
And I think the only way
we can truly start to deal with that is,

680
00:36:54,103 --> 00:36:56,481
I believe
we need to tax the rich.

681
00:36:56,564 --> 00:36:57,774
And...

682
00:37:00,777 --> 00:37:02,278
It's something
I'm very passionate about.

683
00:37:02,361 --> 00:37:05,239
I've been on lots of marches
with my friends about it.

684
00:37:05,323 --> 00:37:06,365
And...

685
00:37:12,497 --> 00:37:15,166
And then a couple
of years ago...

686
00:37:21,547 --> 00:37:23,591
...I got a job...

687
00:37:24,717 --> 00:37:28,054
...and it was the first time in my life
I'd been sort of fairly well paid.

688
00:37:28,137 --> 00:37:31,891
And I found myself on one
of these marches with my friends.

689
00:37:31,974 --> 00:37:35,144
And I was like, tax the rich!
Tax the rich! Tax...

690
00:37:35,228 --> 00:37:38,523
Maybe deal with them
on an individual, case-by-case basis.

691
00:37:38,606 --> 00:37:41,317
Like, let's hear them out.

692
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:46,197
Some of them probably got good hearts,
hearts of gold, if you will.

693
00:37:49,826 --> 00:37:53,996
But I'll tell you the truth, right?
So I was involved in "Ted Lasso," right?

694
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:55,081
And...

695
00:37:57,750 --> 00:37:59,418
Thank you very much.

696
00:37:59,502 --> 00:38:01,671
And I will be forever grateful for it.

697
00:38:01,754 --> 00:38:03,214
It truly changed my life.

698
00:38:04,215 --> 00:38:07,635
I had been working for years
and years before that.

699
00:38:08,302 --> 00:38:12,640
Turns out, it makes quite a big difference
when people actually watch the thing.

700
00:38:13,850 --> 00:38:15,143
Previous to "Ted Lasso,"

701
00:38:15,226 --> 00:38:18,563
I'd just sort of been making stuff
and kind of kicking it down a well.

702
00:38:18,646 --> 00:38:22,233
Like, see you later, my 20s.
Absolute waste of time.

703
00:38:24,694 --> 00:38:26,988
So I did "Ted Lasso,"
and it changed my life,

704
00:38:27,071 --> 00:38:28,781
and I feel very privileged.

705
00:38:28,865 --> 00:38:31,367
And people often come up to me,
and they say, like, what's next?

706
00:38:31,450 --> 00:38:32,994
What have you got going on next?

707
00:38:33,077 --> 00:38:37,498
And since you've been
very generous to me, actually,

708
00:38:37,582 --> 00:38:40,459
I will share with you an exclusive.

709
00:38:40,543 --> 00:38:42,378
But you can't tell anyone

710
00:38:42,461 --> 00:38:44,797
because the special
won't come out for a while.

711
00:38:44,881 --> 00:38:47,175
Like, I've been in LA.
I've been pitching a show.

712
00:38:47,258 --> 00:38:49,177
I'm really excited, but you can't--

713
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:51,179
I haven't sold it yet. I've come close.

714
00:38:51,262 --> 00:38:52,471
Anyway, I'll tell you.

715
00:38:53,347 --> 00:38:56,475
So the next show
that I want to make...

716
00:38:57,393 --> 00:39:01,105
...is a show called "MDMA Fighting."

717
00:39:04,567 --> 00:39:06,402
And what it is...

718
00:39:06,485 --> 00:39:10,072
you take two highly skilled
MMA fighters,

719
00:39:10,156 --> 00:39:14,994
you dose them up with MDMA
30 minutes before a match,

720
00:39:15,077 --> 00:39:18,664
then half hour later, you stick them
in a cage together, and you go, go.

721
00:39:18,748 --> 00:39:20,917
And they walk towards each other like...

722
00:39:35,264 --> 00:39:37,141
You are so big.

723
00:39:38,726 --> 00:39:41,062
Your skin is so tight.

724
00:39:41,145 --> 00:39:43,648
And the referee's like, come on!
And he pushes them together.

725
00:39:43,731 --> 00:39:45,858
But they just start
nuzzling each other's necks

726
00:39:45,942 --> 00:39:47,443
and squeezing each other's head.

727
00:39:47,526 --> 00:39:48,903
And he's like, break it up!

728
00:39:48,986 --> 00:39:50,863
And they're like, leave us alone!

729
00:39:50,947 --> 00:39:53,449
And they're just cuddling
and cuddling and cuddling.

730
00:39:53,532 --> 00:39:54,659
They won't let go of each other.

731
00:39:54,742 --> 00:39:56,994
And they're cuddling
and cuddling, cuddling.

732
00:39:57,078 --> 00:40:00,289
And they end up down on the ground.
They're cuddling.

733
00:40:00,373 --> 00:40:02,667
And then they lie there arm in arm,

734
00:40:02,750 --> 00:40:05,336
and then they look up,
and one of them goes...

735
00:40:06,337 --> 00:40:07,964
It's a cage.

736
00:40:09,215 --> 00:40:12,301
And the other one goes,
when you think about it,

737
00:40:12,385 --> 00:40:14,178
is it all a cage?

738
00:40:23,271 --> 00:40:24,355
Thank you.

739
00:40:25,273 --> 00:40:27,108
Thank you very much, yeah.

740
00:40:27,191 --> 00:40:29,652
The pitches are going well, you know.

741
00:40:29,735 --> 00:40:32,238
Mark Cuban is a yes, so we'll see.

742
00:40:35,032 --> 00:40:37,451
Just a warning,
this next thing I'm gonna say

743
00:40:37,535 --> 00:40:39,912
is the most controversial thing
I'm gonna say tonight,

744
00:40:39,996 --> 00:40:41,289
so just strap in.

745
00:40:41,372 --> 00:40:42,915
Like, we'll get through this bit,

746
00:40:42,999 --> 00:40:44,792
and then it's easy
from here on out, all right?

747
00:40:45,584 --> 00:40:47,586
Well, look, I'm gonna say this...

748
00:40:48,587 --> 00:40:51,507
...because I do actually think
it's important to speak your truth,

749
00:40:51,590 --> 00:40:54,135
and I don't want to pretend
I'm something I'm not anymore.

750
00:40:54,218 --> 00:40:57,805
So I'm just gonna say it,
then it's been said, okay?

751
00:40:59,598 --> 00:41:02,310
I love musicals.

752
00:41:02,393 --> 00:41:03,728
All right?

753
00:41:06,355 --> 00:41:08,024
I love musicals.

754
00:41:08,107 --> 00:41:09,942
I'm not gonna pretend I don't anymore.

755
00:41:10,026 --> 00:41:11,777
I do actually love musicals.

756
00:41:11,861 --> 00:41:16,407
I love musicals, but I hate plays.

757
00:41:17,408 --> 00:41:20,828
Plays are boring, and you all know it.

758
00:41:21,412 --> 00:41:25,750
Once you've enjoyed a musical,
it's very difficult to get back to a play.

759
00:41:25,833 --> 00:41:29,545
Once you've experienced the majesty
of "Defying Gravity,"

760
00:41:29,628 --> 00:41:33,341
very difficult to get anything
out of, "To be or not to be."

761
00:41:33,424 --> 00:41:35,676
You're talking.
Plays are boring.

762
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,428
Plays are boring.

763
00:41:37,511 --> 00:41:41,640
And anyone who tells you otherwise
is lying to you and themselves.

764
00:41:41,724 --> 00:41:44,060
Chekhov can fuck off.

765
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:47,980
And Shakespeare...

766
00:41:48,064 --> 00:41:50,649
why are we still talking about this cunt?

767
00:41:52,109 --> 00:41:54,653
I went to see "Romeo and Juliet."

768
00:41:55,279 --> 00:41:59,075
It is an exact rip-off
of "West Side Story."

769
00:42:02,244 --> 00:42:06,582
You think I'm not gonna notice
'cause you took the clicking out, William?

770
00:42:06,665 --> 00:42:07,792
Come on!

771
00:42:08,751 --> 00:42:11,087
And if Shakespeare
is such a genius writer,

772
00:42:11,170 --> 00:42:13,422
let's talk about the plotting
of "Romeo and Juliet."

773
00:42:13,506 --> 00:42:15,591
First two acts, fine.
Star-crossed lovers, fine.

774
00:42:15,674 --> 00:42:18,219
Then what happens is, Juliet says,
I want to marry Romeo.

775
00:42:18,302 --> 00:42:20,513
Her dad says no,
and he locks her in a bedroom

776
00:42:20,596 --> 00:42:21,889
with a priest and a nurse.

777
00:42:21,972 --> 00:42:22,973
Okay.

778
00:42:23,057 --> 00:42:24,266
She says, what will I do?

779
00:42:24,350 --> 00:42:25,810
The priest says, I've got an idea.

780
00:42:25,893 --> 00:42:29,105
Never a good sign when a priest says
to a child, I have an idea.

781
00:42:30,481 --> 00:42:32,608
He says, I've got this poison.

782
00:42:32,691 --> 00:42:35,528
I haven't really tried it,
but I'm pretty sure if you take it,

783
00:42:35,611 --> 00:42:37,988
you'll be dead for 48 hours.

784
00:42:38,072 --> 00:42:41,033
They'll have a funeral. They'll mourn you.
They'll leave you in a crypt.

785
00:42:41,117 --> 00:42:43,285
And then in two days,
Romeo can come along.

786
00:42:43,369 --> 00:42:45,413
You'll wake up,
and you two can run off.

787
00:42:45,496 --> 00:42:49,708
If Shakespeare is such a good writer,
the next line should be Juliet saying...

788
00:42:51,335 --> 00:42:53,712
...does anyone have
any other ideas?

789
00:42:55,756 --> 00:42:58,342
That sounds fucking mental.

790
00:42:59,135 --> 00:43:01,679
No, Juliet, it's always
the most obvious thing.

791
00:43:01,762 --> 00:43:04,432
It's got to be the 48-hour poison thing.

792
00:43:04,515 --> 00:43:06,434
Can we not just sneak out the back?

793
00:43:06,517 --> 00:43:09,770
No, sorry. It's got to be
the old 48-hour poison.

794
00:43:09,854 --> 00:43:11,647
What, you're saying
they'll have a funeral?

795
00:43:11,730 --> 00:43:12,731
Yeah.

796
00:43:12,815 --> 00:43:15,109
What if they cremate me?
You're overthinking it, Juliet.

797
00:43:17,778 --> 00:43:20,739
I went to see "Hamlet" or "Macbeth"--
couldn't tell you which.

798
00:43:22,741 --> 00:43:24,660
I went to see "Hamlet" or "Macbeth"--
couldn't tell you which.

799
00:43:24,743 --> 00:43:26,662
They're both gibberish, right?

800
00:43:26,745 --> 00:43:30,583
This is how low people's bar
was for entertainment.

801
00:43:30,666 --> 00:43:33,711
In the middle of "Hamlet" or "Macbeth"--
doesn't matter which--

802
00:43:33,794 --> 00:43:38,299
in the middle of "Hamlet" or "Macbeth,"
one of the characters says this...

803
00:43:38,382 --> 00:43:40,301
"Well, yes...

804
00:43:40,384 --> 00:43:43,095
as the hare, the lion."

805
00:43:43,179 --> 00:43:45,806
And people laughed.

806
00:43:45,890 --> 00:43:49,393
I was fucking fuming.

807
00:43:49,477 --> 00:43:52,646
I was stalking the aisles,
like, are you fucking kidding me?

808
00:43:52,730 --> 00:43:55,065
This is seriously doing it for you?

809
00:43:55,149 --> 00:43:57,318
I said, take yourself
to an open-mic comedy night,

810
00:43:57,401 --> 00:43:59,320
listen to someone ask
where the Peruvians are at,

811
00:43:59,403 --> 00:44:01,572
and it'll blow the brains
out of your head.

812
00:44:04,408 --> 00:44:06,452
And, look, I am well aware
that one day I will do a play,

813
00:44:06,535 --> 00:44:08,662
and this clip will be used against me.

814
00:44:08,746 --> 00:44:10,122
But let me be very clear.

815
00:44:10,206 --> 00:44:11,707
I never said it isn't fun to do a play.

816
00:44:11,790 --> 00:44:14,126
It's really fun to do a play.
It's just boring to watch them.

817
00:44:14,210 --> 00:44:15,586
Please come see my play.

818
00:44:22,343 --> 00:44:24,637
I hate plays,
but I love musicals,

819
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:28,224
'cause a musical is like
a play where stuff happens.

820
00:44:29,433 --> 00:44:32,436
But as much as I love a musical,
and I do love a musical,

821
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:34,980
I could never be in a musical.

822
00:44:35,064 --> 00:44:36,941
And it's not because
I can't sing or dance.

823
00:44:37,024 --> 00:44:38,025
I can't.

824
00:44:39,485 --> 00:44:43,155
It's more because
as much as I love a musical,

825
00:44:43,239 --> 00:44:46,242
I could never do the face...

826
00:44:47,243 --> 00:44:49,954
...that every actor has to do

827
00:44:50,037 --> 00:44:51,956
at the start of every musical

828
00:44:52,039 --> 00:44:55,834
without wanting
to, you know, self-harm.

829
00:44:57,711 --> 00:44:59,880
Since we're filming this,
I will try it for you, right?

830
00:44:59,964 --> 00:45:01,423
I'm gonna try the face.

831
00:45:01,507 --> 00:45:04,093
Now, you've all seen a musical, right?

832
00:45:04,176 --> 00:45:06,762
Some are silly. Some are difficult.
Some are deep. Some are frivolous.

833
00:45:06,845 --> 00:45:10,558
All musicals begin
with an actor coming onstage,

834
00:45:10,641 --> 00:45:12,268
doing this face.

835
00:45:28,951 --> 00:45:30,869
New York City, I made it!

836
00:45:30,953 --> 00:45:32,663
Fuck it, I'll be sick in my own mouth.

837
00:45:35,124 --> 00:45:38,669
All right, we are now
at the relationship section of the show.

838
00:45:40,838 --> 00:45:42,590
Do we have any marrieds here?

839
00:45:44,174 --> 00:45:45,676
So many marrieds.

840
00:45:46,385 --> 00:45:48,762
Are you a married?
How long have you been married?

841
00:45:48,846 --> 00:45:50,139
Almost 30 years.

842
00:45:50,222 --> 00:45:53,100
Almost 30 fucking years? Respect.

843
00:45:54,226 --> 00:45:56,520
That sounds like a record.
Can anyone beat that?

844
00:45:56,604 --> 00:45:57,605
47!

845
00:45:57,688 --> 00:45:59,898
40-fucking-7 over here.

846
00:46:00,858 --> 00:46:02,234
This is now a very weird auction.

847
00:46:02,318 --> 00:46:03,902
No one wins anything, but...

848
00:46:04,820 --> 00:46:05,821
...but you do win our respect.

849
00:46:05,904 --> 00:46:09,408
47, listen, I am not going
to make fun of the marrieds.

850
00:46:09,491 --> 00:46:11,452
I got nothing but respect
for the marrieds.

851
00:46:11,535 --> 00:46:12,620
I've never been married.

852
00:46:12,703 --> 00:46:15,164
I never made a vow
in front of God or the law.

853
00:46:15,247 --> 00:46:18,917
But you did,
and I'm sure you meant it...

854
00:46:20,628 --> 00:46:21,962
...at the time.

855
00:46:23,339 --> 00:46:25,507
I've never been married.

856
00:46:25,591 --> 00:46:28,469
And the truth is,
I never wanted to be married.

857
00:46:28,552 --> 00:46:30,888
And it's only recently
it occurs to me why.

858
00:46:30,971 --> 00:46:32,473
And I think it's actually
'cause of comedy.

859
00:46:32,556 --> 00:46:35,059
I think comedy ruined marriage for me,

860
00:46:35,142 --> 00:46:37,895
'cause I grew up obsessed
with stand-up and sitcoms,

861
00:46:37,978 --> 00:46:41,482
which means my whole life,
I saw one stereotype of what marriage is.

862
00:46:41,565 --> 00:46:45,069
I thought what marriage is, is where a man
lives in a house with a woman

863
00:46:45,152 --> 00:46:48,072
who never, ever, ever wants
to have sex with him again.

864
00:46:48,155 --> 00:46:50,074
You know what I mean?
Like, all sitcoms, they're always like,

865
00:46:50,157 --> 00:46:53,577
Debra, why ain't we fucking?
You know what I mean? Like...

866
00:46:54,787 --> 00:46:56,747
Thursdays on NBC...

867
00:46:58,290 --> 00:47:01,460
...Frigid Frida is back.
You know what I mean?

868
00:47:01,543 --> 00:47:03,754
And I always thought,
I mean, I like sex.

869
00:47:03,837 --> 00:47:05,964
That sounds awful.
Why would you do that?

870
00:47:06,048 --> 00:47:07,925
But, recently,
I've been speaking

871
00:47:08,008 --> 00:47:10,969
to lots of straight couples
in long-term relationships,

872
00:47:11,053 --> 00:47:13,514
and I've been asking them
about their sex lives

873
00:47:13,597 --> 00:47:15,766
because I am a pervert...

874
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:19,395
...and I don't understand
the basics of small talk.

875
00:47:20,396 --> 00:47:24,400
And what I have discovered
in the overwhelming majority

876
00:47:24,483 --> 00:47:28,529
is that this stereotype
is the wrong way around.

877
00:47:28,612 --> 00:47:31,240
Most of the men I speak to are like,
yeah, we have enough sex.

878
00:47:31,323 --> 00:47:33,992
Most of the women think
they're not having enough sex.

879
00:47:34,702 --> 00:47:38,080
And the reason it's gone
so deathly quiet...

880
00:47:40,165 --> 00:47:42,292
...is because that is true.

881
00:47:44,294 --> 00:47:46,213
Holy fuck, that was tense.

882
00:47:50,008 --> 00:47:53,220
So, if that is the case,
and, oh, boy, it definitely is...

883
00:47:54,805 --> 00:47:56,640
...then why is it the case now?

884
00:47:56,724 --> 00:47:59,810
Luckily, I have a theory.
Otherwise, this bit would go nowhere.

885
00:48:00,853 --> 00:48:03,731
I think it's because sex is weird, right?

886
00:48:03,814 --> 00:48:06,650
Sex is weird, particularly how I do it.

887
00:48:06,734 --> 00:48:08,026
Like...

888
00:48:09,069 --> 00:48:11,321
Guys, the dog survived.
No, look...

889
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:16,368
Sex is weird.
Sex is weird, particularly starting sex.

890
00:48:16,452 --> 00:48:19,079
I find the beginning of sex so stressful.

891
00:48:19,163 --> 00:48:22,833
I feel the same way about sex
as I do about taking ecstasy.

892
00:48:22,916 --> 00:48:24,752
Like, in the build-up, I'm always nervous.

893
00:48:24,835 --> 00:48:26,378
Oh, God, I hope
it's all gonna be all right.

894
00:48:26,462 --> 00:48:30,048
Once I'm doing it, I'm like,
why aren't I always doing this?

895
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:35,179
And it's because these are two
very different states of being, right?

896
00:48:35,262 --> 00:48:38,182
One is like being a human.
One is like being an animal.

897
00:48:38,265 --> 00:48:41,351
It's quite a big hump you have to get over
to get from one state to the other.

898
00:48:41,435 --> 00:48:42,978
And everyone has to do it.

899
00:48:43,061 --> 00:48:45,773
Like, even, like, someone doing
a TED Talk, right?

900
00:48:45,856 --> 00:48:47,399
Someone doing a TED Talk.

901
00:48:47,483 --> 00:48:51,278
So they're like, oh, yes,
the universe or whatever.

902
00:48:52,988 --> 00:48:56,408
That same person,
just a couple of hours later,

903
00:48:56,492 --> 00:48:58,035
can be like this...

904
00:49:04,082 --> 00:49:07,211
That's not how I do it, just to be--

905
00:49:07,294 --> 00:49:08,504
I'm trying to make a point.

906
00:49:09,713 --> 00:49:11,006
This isn't exactly--

907
00:49:11,089 --> 00:49:13,717
You know, it's just an exaggeration.

908
00:49:13,801 --> 00:49:15,803
Everyone has to do it.
Smart people--

909
00:49:15,886 --> 00:49:18,639
Albert Einstein one day
was like, E equals MC-squared.

910
00:49:18,722 --> 00:49:20,057
And then later, he was like...

911
00:49:22,059 --> 00:49:25,103
Such a big hump to get
from one state to the other.

912
00:49:25,187 --> 00:49:29,566
That's why I think being sexually rejected
is the most humiliating thing,

913
00:49:29,650 --> 00:49:31,443
'cause it's like,
you're on a date with someone,

914
00:49:31,527 --> 00:49:34,238
and you misread the cues, and you're like,
oh, time to become the animal.

915
00:49:34,321 --> 00:49:38,450
So you put on paws and a monkey mask,
and you try to get over the hump.

916
00:49:38,534 --> 00:49:39,827
And she's like,
what do you think you're doing?

917
00:49:39,910 --> 00:49:43,038
And you're like, absolutely nothing,
nothing at all, nothing at all.

918
00:49:43,121 --> 00:49:45,332
I was enjoying all the conversing.
More, please.

919
00:49:46,083 --> 00:49:48,252
It was like watching a play.
I loved it.

920
00:49:50,128 --> 00:49:54,216
And that's why I think
in the beginning of a relationship,

921
00:49:54,299 --> 00:49:57,678
it's easy for a man to initiate sex,

922
00:49:57,761 --> 00:50:00,931
because she doesn't know you.

923
00:50:01,014 --> 00:50:04,643
So you can tell yourself,
I'm a big, strong animal.

924
00:50:04,726 --> 00:50:07,312
I'm a big, strong monkey animal man.

925
00:50:07,396 --> 00:50:10,566
And you can get over that hump
and initiate sex.

926
00:50:10,649 --> 00:50:13,777
But once you've been with someone
for, like...

927
00:50:14,778 --> 00:50:16,363
...three weeks...

928
00:50:17,781 --> 00:50:20,284
...every time you're gearing up
to get over that hump,

929
00:50:20,367 --> 00:50:23,120
part of you is going,
I'm a big, strong monkey animal.

930
00:50:23,203 --> 00:50:27,082
I'm a big, strong animal,
but she did see me cry

931
00:50:27,165 --> 00:50:31,086
through the finale
of "The Great British Bake Off."

932
00:50:33,589 --> 00:50:35,799
Those beautiful fucking scones.

933
00:50:38,176 --> 00:50:41,889
So I've never been married, right?
But I think I've done...

934
00:50:41,972 --> 00:50:43,932
I've tried most of the kind
of relationships you can do.

935
00:50:44,016 --> 00:50:47,603
I've done short-term, medium-term,
long-term, lease.

936
00:50:49,438 --> 00:50:52,524
The furthest I ever got is,
last year, I lived with someone.

937
00:50:52,608 --> 00:50:55,444
And living with someone
was a real game changer,

938
00:50:55,527 --> 00:50:58,530
because previous to that,
I thought what having a girlfriend was--

939
00:50:58,614 --> 00:51:00,532
I thought that's
where you meet up with someone

940
00:51:00,616 --> 00:51:03,243
three or four times a week,
and when you meet up with them,

941
00:51:03,327 --> 00:51:06,914
you show them the 4% of yourself

942
00:51:06,997 --> 00:51:10,584
that is acceptable for public consumption.

943
00:51:10,667 --> 00:51:13,545
And when you feel the 96% bubbling up,

944
00:51:13,629 --> 00:51:16,340
you say, I've had a lovely time.
Let's catch up soon.

945
00:51:16,423 --> 00:51:19,217
You rush home, you close the door,
and you regenerate.

946
00:51:20,344 --> 00:51:21,887
She was in my house.

947
00:51:21,970 --> 00:51:25,891
Day 2, the 96% was everywhere.

948
00:51:25,974 --> 00:51:30,020
She thought I was a fucking weirdo
'cause I cook everything in a wok.

949
00:51:32,856 --> 00:51:34,858
But, like, if it's good enough
for stir fry,

950
00:51:34,942 --> 00:51:36,818
it's good enough for oatmeal.

951
00:51:40,572 --> 00:51:44,451
And I have a system for getting dressed
that used to drive her insane.

952
00:51:44,534 --> 00:51:48,622
I'm gonna share this system with you,
and it will change your lives.

953
00:51:48,705 --> 00:51:49,957
This is how I get dressed, right?

954
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:52,084
The end of the day,
when I'm finished with my clothes,

955
00:51:52,167 --> 00:51:54,169
I take them off,
and I put them in the washer.

956
00:51:54,252 --> 00:51:56,213
When the washing is full, I turn it on.

957
00:51:56,296 --> 00:51:59,091
I then move everything to the dryer,
and I turn that on.

958
00:51:59,174 --> 00:52:00,592
And then when that's done,

959
00:52:00,676 --> 00:52:04,596
I then get dressed out of the dryer,

960
00:52:04,680 --> 00:52:07,057
and the cycle continues.

961
00:52:07,933 --> 00:52:11,395
What I am not doing is wasting my life

962
00:52:11,478 --> 00:52:14,481
on this middleman we call drawers.

963
00:52:15,607 --> 00:52:17,401
I'm not taking all the clothes.

964
00:52:17,484 --> 00:52:21,989
Quick, we must hide our other clothes.
People are coming to the house.

965
00:52:22,072 --> 00:52:24,700
If they see we have other clothes,
they'll kill us.

966
00:52:25,534 --> 00:52:28,412
They must never know that we have
more clothes than what we're wearing.

967
00:52:28,495 --> 00:52:31,873
Quick! Hide them properly.
Take them fully upstairs.

968
00:52:31,957 --> 00:52:34,418
You must hide them and fold them.
Put them in boxes.

969
00:52:34,501 --> 00:52:37,212
They must never see we have other clothes.

970
00:52:37,295 --> 00:52:39,589
Oh, my God do you know what I need?
Some of those other clothes.

971
00:52:39,673 --> 00:52:43,635
I better go back up the stairs
and open the boxes and unfold the thing.

972
00:52:43,719 --> 00:52:47,097
The years and years that I have saved.

973
00:52:47,180 --> 00:52:49,641
Do you want to know how I won two Emmys?

974
00:52:49,725 --> 00:52:51,727
Because I had fucking time.

975
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:04,114
So I'm single now.

976
00:53:05,657 --> 00:53:08,035
No, I'm single by choice.

977
00:53:08,118 --> 00:53:09,119
Her choice.

978
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:11,747
No, it was actually mutual.

979
00:53:11,830 --> 00:53:14,875
We came to the mutual agreement
that I was a prick

980
00:53:14,958 --> 00:53:17,878
and she should marry her ex, but...

981
00:53:17,961 --> 00:53:19,755
No, it's fine. She's dead.

982
00:53:23,425 --> 00:53:25,343
That, you're delighted by?

983
00:53:26,470 --> 00:53:28,346
This is a strange group of people.

984
00:53:35,771 --> 00:53:37,773
69!

985
00:53:40,942 --> 00:53:42,486
69!

986
00:53:44,821 --> 00:53:46,156
69!

987
00:53:48,408 --> 00:53:50,368
69.

988
00:53:50,452 --> 00:53:52,079
It's another 45 minutes of this.

989
00:53:52,162 --> 00:53:55,290
69, the sex move.

990
00:53:55,373 --> 00:53:57,375
69, the position.

991
00:53:58,168 --> 00:54:01,088
Not for me.
I hate it, in case you're wondering.

992
00:54:01,171 --> 00:54:03,507
Literally, no one asked.
I'm telling you anyway.

993
00:54:03,590 --> 00:54:06,510
I hate a 69. I hate a 69.

994
00:54:06,593 --> 00:54:08,178
And I'll tell you for why.

995
00:54:09,012 --> 00:54:13,809
I can't rub my belly
and pat my head at the same time.

996
00:54:19,022 --> 00:54:20,273
It's sex.

997
00:54:20,357 --> 00:54:22,609
It's not Cirque du fucking Soleil.

998
00:54:23,735 --> 00:54:28,323
Like, yes, it's important to share,
but you can take turns.

999
00:54:28,406 --> 00:54:31,034
A 69 always ends in an 11...

1000
00:54:32,953 --> 00:54:37,040
Just two people lying next to each other,
feeling smelly and ashamed.

1001
00:54:39,292 --> 00:54:42,045
I much prefer a 16...

1002
00:54:43,046 --> 00:54:46,424
...which is bum sex
with a pregnant lady.

1003
00:54:50,637 --> 00:54:52,430
I don't know if that's making the edit.

1004
00:54:56,852 --> 00:54:58,562
Fucking hell.

1005
00:54:58,645 --> 00:55:02,816
All right, we should probably start
wrapping up fairly soon.

1006
00:55:02,899 --> 00:55:05,569
So, look, the last thing
I want to tell you about...

1007
00:55:05,652 --> 00:55:07,195
I talked about love and relationships.

1008
00:55:07,279 --> 00:55:11,408
One thing I haven't told you
is I once truly, genuinely experienced

1009
00:55:11,491 --> 00:55:12,868
love at first sight.

1010
00:55:12,951 --> 00:55:15,162
I went to this party.
This woman turned around.

1011
00:55:15,245 --> 00:55:18,456
Our eyes locked, and I was like,
shit, fuck, I'm in love.

1012
00:55:18,540 --> 00:55:21,251
Like, that's a real thing,
love at first sight, right?

1013
00:55:24,254 --> 00:55:27,883
If you're in a couple not nodding at that,
that is a long drive home.

1014
00:55:29,009 --> 00:55:30,260
Did you hear what he said?

1015
00:55:30,343 --> 00:55:31,344
Yeah, I heard.

1016
00:55:32,470 --> 00:55:35,098
He can't do impressions,
and I think he fucked a dog.

1017
00:55:38,101 --> 00:55:39,811
Honestly, I met this woman.
Our eyes locked.

1018
00:55:39,895 --> 00:55:41,605
It's embarrassing
what happened in my head.

1019
00:55:41,688 --> 00:55:45,025
When I saw this woman, the first thought
I had was, oh, nothing matters.

1020
00:55:45,108 --> 00:55:47,694
We can just live in fields
and eat berries.

1021
00:55:49,112 --> 00:55:50,780
And me and this woman got together.

1022
00:55:50,864 --> 00:55:53,992
And now, this woman, she's
half Irish and half Chinese,

1023
00:55:54,075 --> 00:55:55,994
which means she's incredibly beautiful

1024
00:55:56,077 --> 00:55:58,496
and I am never allowed
to do an impression of her.

1025
00:55:59,706 --> 00:56:01,833
Where are all my "Chirish" at?

1026
00:56:01,917 --> 00:56:03,126
Anyway...

1027
00:56:06,838 --> 00:56:09,216
So we got together, and we were in love.

1028
00:56:09,299 --> 00:56:10,926
I think this is love.
Is this love?

1029
00:56:11,009 --> 00:56:13,845
Is love when you text each other
back and forth all day--

1030
00:56:13,929 --> 00:56:17,349
text, text, text, text, text, text, text,
text, text, text, text, text, text, text--

1031
00:56:17,432 --> 00:56:20,518
and then if, at some point, she doesn't
immediately reply to one of your texts,

1032
00:56:20,602 --> 00:56:22,520
you're like, right,
she's having an affair?

1033
00:56:23,146 --> 00:56:26,066
Right, she's not texted back.
She has a dick in her. Okay.

1034
00:56:26,149 --> 00:56:29,277
And it's a bigger dick than mine.
She's finally satisfied. Okay.

1035
00:56:29,819 --> 00:56:31,655
Oh, another dick must have joined,
so her hands are full.

1036
00:56:31,738 --> 00:56:33,865
She can't send a text. Okay.

1037
00:56:33,949 --> 00:56:36,076
Oh, another dick must have joined,
and now it's in her mouth.

1038
00:56:36,159 --> 00:56:38,161
Otherwise, she'd tell Siri
to drop me a line.

1039
00:56:38,954 --> 00:56:40,664
I knew this would happen.
I'm a fucking idiot.

1040
00:56:40,747 --> 00:56:42,916
And then 25 minutes later,
she texts back, sorry, baby.

1041
00:56:42,999 --> 00:56:44,251
I was at the gym.
Miss you.

1042
00:56:44,334 --> 00:56:46,544
And you're like, all right, a bit needy.

1043
00:56:49,005 --> 00:56:50,507
Is that love?

1044
00:56:50,590 --> 00:56:52,717
And there's a real madness
to this kind of love.

1045
00:56:52,801 --> 00:56:55,053
Like, I look back at the texts
we were sending each other.

1046
00:56:55,136 --> 00:56:57,889
I'm like, are these love notes
or death threats?

1047
00:56:57,973 --> 00:57:00,100
Like, the insane things
you say to each other,

1048
00:57:00,183 --> 00:57:01,685
like, I can't wait to be back with you.

1049
00:57:01,768 --> 00:57:03,687
I can't wait to be kissing you.
I can't wait to be on top of you.

1050
00:57:03,770 --> 00:57:07,107
I can't wait to cut off your skin
and wear you as a Slanket.

1051
00:57:08,358 --> 00:57:09,985
And you sort of lose all reason.

1052
00:57:10,068 --> 00:57:11,278
You kind of lie in bed together.

1053
00:57:11,361 --> 00:57:14,030
Like, we actually don't have
to go to work today, do we?

1054
00:57:14,114 --> 00:57:15,865
We don't have to go to work.
We're in love.

1055
00:57:15,949 --> 00:57:18,285
As if your boss is in the office going,
where's Brett today?

1056
00:57:18,368 --> 00:57:20,287
Oh, he can't come in, sir.
He's in love.

1057
00:57:20,370 --> 00:57:22,330
We must give him paid time off.

1058
00:57:23,248 --> 00:57:24,958
And you become really sort of dirty.

1059
00:57:25,041 --> 00:57:27,002
You just sort of lie there,
like, don't leave the bed.

1060
00:57:27,085 --> 00:57:28,295
Don't go have a shower.

1061
00:57:28,378 --> 00:57:31,381
We can just lie here passing
back and forth the same UTI.

1062
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:36,011
Cranberry juice, my angel?

1063
00:57:40,223 --> 00:57:43,476
Now, it may not shock you to discover

1064
00:57:43,560 --> 00:57:45,812
that that relationship ended.

1065
00:57:46,813 --> 00:57:49,733
And when it ended, I spoke to my sister.

1066
00:57:49,816 --> 00:57:52,319
Now, my sister is the opposite of me.

1067
00:57:52,402 --> 00:57:56,406
My sister, she's married.
She's got children. She's happy.

1068
00:57:58,616 --> 00:58:02,329
And I said to her,
I said, was I wrong about this?

1069
00:58:02,412 --> 00:58:05,832
And she said, Brett, you're wrong
about literally everything.

1070
00:58:05,915 --> 00:58:07,751
And I said, no, was I wrong about love?

1071
00:58:07,834 --> 00:58:09,961
And she said, yeah, of course
you were wrong about love.

1072
00:58:10,045 --> 00:58:12,547
She said, love is...

1073
00:58:12,630 --> 00:58:17,469
she said, when you find your soulmate,

1074
00:58:17,552 --> 00:58:22,057
you will feel completely at peace.

1075
00:58:23,641 --> 00:58:24,851
And I was like...

1076
00:58:26,811 --> 00:58:28,855
Then that definitely wasn't love.

1077
00:58:29,856 --> 00:58:32,442
That was a fucking nightmare.
I don't think I slept.

1078
00:58:33,234 --> 00:58:38,031
And I've thought about it a lot because
I suspect that she's probably right.

1079
00:58:38,114 --> 00:58:41,201
But if my sister's right,

1080
00:58:41,284 --> 00:58:44,788
that means
that all your favorite love songs,

1081
00:58:44,871 --> 00:58:47,165
none of them are actually about love.

1082
00:58:47,248 --> 00:58:50,210
These are all just songs about addiction.

1083
00:58:50,293 --> 00:58:52,670
They're all just Cookie Monster songs.

1084
00:58:53,421 --> 00:58:54,422
You know what I mean?

1085
00:58:54,506 --> 00:58:57,008
You know the types of songs, where
it's like, our love is a roller coaster.

1086
00:58:57,092 --> 00:58:59,010
The house is on fire.
Let's cut our dicks off.

1087
00:58:59,094 --> 00:59:00,470
You know what I mean?

1088
00:59:02,180 --> 00:59:04,391
Because if my sister is right,

1089
00:59:04,474 --> 00:59:08,103
then all love songs
should go like this.

1090
00:59:20,949 --> 00:59:24,828
I feel so comfortable

1091
00:59:24,911 --> 00:59:28,331
Sitting on a couch with you

1092
00:59:28,915 --> 00:59:33,086
Watching a box set for an hour

1093
00:59:33,169 --> 00:59:36,714
Maybe watch another one, too

1094
00:59:36,798 --> 00:59:41,094
If you have to work late at the office

1095
00:59:41,177 --> 00:59:44,431
I won't criticize

1096
00:59:44,514 --> 00:59:48,059
'Cause I trust you,
and I know you love me

1097
00:59:48,143 --> 00:59:52,272
And for you, my penis is the right size

1098
00:59:52,355 --> 00:59:59,362
For you, my penis is the right size

1099
01:00:03,158 --> 01:00:06,369
Thank you very much, New Jersey!
Good night!

1100
01:00:13,960 --> 01:00:15,587
Brett, great show.

1101
01:00:15,670 --> 01:00:16,880
Thanks, Mo.

1102
01:00:16,963 --> 01:00:19,549
Hey, do you know if the red squirrel came?

1103
01:00:20,550 --> 01:00:23,094
No. The Red Squirrel didn't come.

1104
01:00:23,178 --> 01:00:25,180
- What about Big Bear?
- No.

1105
01:00:25,263 --> 01:00:26,973
Crazy Orange Bird?

1106
01:00:27,056 --> 01:00:28,516
Hot Dogs?

1107
01:00:28,600 --> 01:00:29,726
No, Brett.

1108
01:00:30,351 --> 01:00:31,352
Okay.

1109
01:00:32,103 --> 01:00:33,980
Well, at least Buddy G was there.

1110
01:00:34,647 --> 01:00:38,776
Brett, we've been over this.
These friends of yours, they're not real.

1111
01:00:41,529 --> 01:00:42,530
Okay.

1112
01:00:43,823 --> 01:00:44,991
I'll see you at the diner.

1113
01:00:45,742 --> 01:00:47,035
Yeah.

1114
01:00:47,118 --> 01:00:48,119
Cool.

1115
01:00:49,245 --> 01:00:52,040
Great show, Brett!
You were fantastic.

1116
01:00:52,123 --> 01:00:53,917
- You were just wonderful.
- Wow.

1117
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,753
- Okay, good!
- So many bad words! Loved it!

1118
01:00:56,836 --> 01:00:58,505
Yeah, we're going
to the diner to celebrate.

1119
01:00:58,588 --> 01:01:00,715
- Come on.
- You're very bad at impressions.

1120
01:01:00,798 --> 01:01:03,510
- Oi! Don't be rude.
- Clear off. Be nice.

1121
01:01:03,593 --> 01:01:06,137
- We'll meet you at the diner.
- Yeah, you try following your dreams.

1122
01:01:06,221 --> 01:01:08,890
Hey. You did good.

1123
01:01:08,973 --> 01:01:11,142
Thanks, Buddy G.

1124
01:01:11,226 --> 01:01:12,685
I didn't think you'd come.

1125
01:01:12,769 --> 01:01:15,939
Are you kidding me?
I wouldn't miss this for the world.

1126
01:01:16,022 --> 01:01:17,857
Come on, let's go get something to eat.

1127
01:01:17,941 --> 01:01:19,734
- Come on.
- Okay.

1128
01:01:25,740 --> 01:01:26,824
Come on, Buddy.
