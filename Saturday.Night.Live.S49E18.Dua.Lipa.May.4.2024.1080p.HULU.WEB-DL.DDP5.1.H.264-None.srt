1
00:00:01,338 --> 00:00:04,988
>>> YOU'RE WATCHING NEW YORK ONE
BECAUSE YOUR WI-FI IS DOWN.

2
00:00:04,988 --> 00:00:09,732
LATER, A RECAP OF HOPE HICKS'
EMOTIONAL TESTIMONY IN DONALD
TRUMP'S HUSH MONEY TRIAL.

3
00:00:09,732 --> 00:00:13,864
FIRST, IT'S COMMUNITY AFFAIRS
WITH RYAN ABERNATHY.

4
00:00:18,763 --> 00:00:23,654
>>> GOOD EVENING AND WELCOME TO
COMMUNITY AFFAIRS.
I'M RYAN ABERNATHY.

5
00:00:23,654 --> 00:00:29,030
COLLEGE STUDENTS HAVE BEEN
PROTESTING ON CAMPUSES ACROSS
THE NATION.

6
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:33,727
TONIGHT WE'LL BE DISCUSSING WITH
MY GUESTS WHO ARE PARENT
STUDENTS OF COLLEGES IN NEW
YORK.

7
00:00:33,727 --> 00:00:37,047
JOIN ME IN WELCOMING THE NEW
STUDENT PARENT, DOUG HOVING.

8
00:00:37,092 --> 00:00:39,077
HI

9
00:00:39,077 --> 00:00:41,111
SARAH HIMES.

10
00:00:41,111 --> 00:00:43,006
>> HI.
THANKS FOR HAVING ME.

11
00:00:43,006 --> 00:00:45,978
>> AND COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY DAD,
ALPHONSE ROBERTS.

12
00:00:45,978 --> 00:00:49,104
>> HI, RYAN, AND HELLO TO MY
WIFE.

13
00:00:50,139 --> 00:00:53,606
THANK

14
00:00:53,606 --> 00:00:57,910
AS PARENTS, HOW DO YOU FEEL
ABOUT THESE PROTESTS ON CAMPUS?
SARAH, WE'LL START WITH YOU.

15
00:00:57,910 --> 00:01:02,900
>> FOR ME, IT'S BEEN TOUGH.
I'M ALL FOR FREE SPEECH,

16
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:06,135
BUT I
DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY THINK
THEY'RE ACCOMPLISHING,

17
00:01:06,135 --> 00:01:09,429
AND
THAT'S REALLY PUTTING A STRAIN
ON ME AND MY DAUGHTER'S
RELATIONSHIP.

18
00:01:09,429 --> 00:01:12,332
>> YEAH.
I WANT TO LET ME SON MAKE HIS
OWN CHOICES,

19
00:01:12,332 --> 00:01:14,628
BUT TO BE HONEST,
IT'S A LITTLE SCARY.

20
00:01:14,628 --> 00:01:17,425
THESE PROTESTS ARE BECOMING WAY
MORE AGGRESSIVE.

21
00:01:17,425 --> 00:01:21,149
>> RIGHT.
BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY, MY
DAUGHTER IS AN ADULT

22
00:01:21,149 --> 00:01:23,004
AND HAS TO
LIVE HER OWN LIFE.

23
00:01:23,004 --> 00:01:26,412
>> WELL, I THINK IT'S JUST
GREAT.
IT'S WONDERFUL.

24
00:01:26,412 --> 00:01:30,637
NOTHING MAKES ME PROUDER THAN
YOUNG PEOPLE USING THEIR VOICES
TO FIGHT FOR WHAT THEY BELIEVE?

25
00:01:30,637 --> 00:01:32,809
>> WOW.
THAT'S VERY ENCOURAGING.

26
00:01:32,809 --> 00:01:36,177
>> YOUR DAUGHTER MUST FEEL SO
SUPPORTED WHEN SHE'S OUT THERE.

27
00:01:36,177 --> 00:01:38,593
>> WHAT'S THAT NOW?

28
00:01:38,593 --> 00:01:41,469
WHEN WHOSE DAUGHTER IS OUT
THERE?

29
00:01:41,469 --> 00:01:42,812
>> AT THE PROTEST.

30
00:01:42,812 --> 00:01:46,566
>> NO, NO, NO.
HUH-HUH, MAN.
YOU BUGGEN.

31
00:01:46,566 --> 00:01:50,716
ALEXIS VANESSA ROBERTS BETTER
HAVE HER BUTT IN CLASS.

32
00:01:50,716 --> 00:01:55,866
LET ME FIND OUT SHE IN ONE OF
THEM DAMN TENTS INSTEAD THE DORM
ROOM THAT I PAY FOR.

33
00:01:55,866 --> 00:01:59,406
>> I THOUGHT YOU WERE IN FAVOR
OF THE STUDENT PROTESTS?

34
00:01:59,406 --> 00:02:05,296
>> BROTHER MAN, I AM SUPPORTIVE
OF Y'ALL'S KIDS PROTESTING, NOT
MY KIDS.

35
00:02:05,296 --> 00:02:09,460
MY KIDS KNOW BETTER.
SHOOT, ALEXIS VANESSA AIN'T
CRAZY.

36
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:12,332
>> YOUR DAUGHTER ATTENDS COLUMN
BOO I CAN'T.

37
00:02:12,332 --> 00:02:15,010
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THE
STUDENTS THAT TOOK OVER HAMILTON
HALL?

38
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:17,905
>> THAT'S GOOD FOR Y'ALL'S KIDS,

39
00:02:17,905 --> 00:02:22,328
BUT THEY AIN'T MINE.
YOU FEEL ME, RYAN?

40
00:02:22,328 --> 00:02:25,279
>> YES, I FEEL YOU, ALPHONSE.

41
00:02:25,279 --> 00:02:28,580
TELL ME, WITH THE RISE IN
ATTENDANCE IN THIS PROTEST,

42
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:31,220
HOW
DOES IT MAKE YOU FEEL ABOUT THE
POLICE PRESENCE?

43
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:35,737
SARAH
>> I'M VERY CONCERNED.

44
00:02:35,737 --> 00:02:39,379
ONE OF MY WORST FEARS IS MY
DAUGHTER BEING THROWN BEHIND
BAR.

45
00:02:39,379 --> 00:02:41,406
THIS IS A CRUCIAL TIME IN HER LIFE,

46
00:02:41,406 --> 00:02:45,804
AND I WOULD HATE FOR HER
TO HAVE AN ARREST FOLLOW HER
FOREVER.

47
00:02:45,804 --> 00:02:49,558
>> MAN, I AIN'T WORRIED ABOUT
5-0.

48
00:02:49,558 --> 00:02:51,496
THAT IS NOT MY BUSINESS.

49
00:02:51,496 --> 00:02:54,808
MY BUSINESS IS ALEXIS VANESSA

50
00:02:54,808 --> 00:02:56,995
FREE

51
00:02:56,995 --> 00:03:00,001
COLUMBIA

52
00:03:02,329 --> 00:03:03,846
SHOOT

53
00:03:03,846 --> 00:03:09,556
DO Y'ALL KNOW THAT THEY GOT THE
NERVE TO WANT 68,000 A YEAR.

54
00:03:09,556 --> 00:03:12,660
>> I MEAN, WE TOTALLY RESPECT
THEIR RIGHT TO PROTEST,

55
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:15,606
BUT I
MEAN WE'RE ALSO MAKING
SACRIFICES FOR OUR KIDS.

56
00:03:15,606 --> 00:03:19,468
>> YEAH.
I'M OUT HERE BUSTING MY HUMP TO
PAY ALL THAT TUITION.

57
00:03:19,468 --> 00:03:22,830
>> WHAT DO YOU DO FOR A LIVING?
>> SISTER GIRL, I DO IT ALL.

58
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:26,644
UBER ALL DAY, UBER EATS ALL NIGHT,

59
00:03:26,644 --> 00:03:30,460
CUT GRASS ON THE
WEEKENDS, SELL GUCCI WALLETS OUT MY TRUNK,

60
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:35,261
LIFE COACHING ON IG.
I BOUNTY HUNT WHENEVER POSSIBLE.

61
00:03:35,261 --> 00:03:39,623
ALL THAT SO SHE CAN SAY SHE GOT
A DEGREE IN AFRICAN-AMERICAN
STUDIES.

62
00:03:39,623 --> 00:03:46,295
LOOK, GIRL, YOU BEEN BLACK YOUR
WHOLE LIFE.
YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS.

63
00:03:46,295 --> 00:03:49,998
>> THAT'S QUITE AN INVESTMENT IN
YOUR DAUGHTER.
>> DAMN SKIPPY IT IS.

64
00:03:49,998 --> 00:03:52,642
SHE'S GIFTED, THOUGH.

65
00:03:52,642 --> 00:03:55,965
SHE GON' CHANGE THE WORLD.
SHE DAMN SURE BETTER.

66
00:03:55,965 --> 00:03:58,602
>> I'M SURE SHE WILL.

67
00:03:58,602 --> 00:04:01,130
>> YES, YES, SHE WILL.

68
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:03,801
SHE'S WORTH EVERY PENNY,

69
00:04:03,801 --> 00:04:08,635
AND I KNOW I SOUND MAD RIGHT ABOUT
NOW, BUT YOU JUST WAIT UNTIL GRADUATION

70
00:04:08,635 --> 00:04:13,680
WHEN YOU SEE THAT
SMILE ACROSS MY FACE WHEN I HEAR
THAT NAME ALEXIS VANESSA ROBERTS

71
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,677
AND I WATCH HER WALK ACROSS THAT
STAGE.

72
00:04:16,678 --> 00:04:18,652
DON'T GET

73
00:04:18,652 --> 00:04:24,160
I ACTUALLY HEARD A FEW
SCHOOLS ARE FULLY CANCELING
THEIR GRADUATION CEREMONIES.

74
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,051
>> SISTER GIRL, I DON'T THINK
YOU GET IT.

75
00:04:27,051 --> 00:04:32,477
ALEXIS VANESSA WILL BE
GRADUATED, EVEN IF I GOT TO DO
IT MYSELF.

76
00:04:32,477 --> 00:04:37,779
BELIEVE ME WHEN I TELL YOU THAT
AT THE END OF THIS MONTH,
I AM
PUTTING ON MY CHURCH CLOTHES,

77
00:04:37,779 --> 00:04:42,115
THREE PUMPS ON COOL WATER
COLOGNE, SMELLING GOOD AS A MUG,

78
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:47,747
AND THEN, BAM, I'M HOPPING IN MY
'98 FORD EXPLORER, BLASTING SOME ANITA BAKER,

79
00:04:47,747 --> 00:04:51,789
AND YOU BETTER
BELIEVE I'M GOING TO BE IN THERE
HOOTING AND HOLLERING

80
00:04:51,789 --> 00:04:54,873
AFTER THEY
EXPLICITLY TOLD US TO WAIT UNTIL
THE END.

81
00:04:54,873 --> 00:04:56,557
THAT'S ALL I KNOW.

82
00:04:56,625 --> 00:04:58,774
>> WOW.
GOT IT ALL PLANNED OUT.

83
00:04:58,774 --> 00:05:00,643
>> YEAH.
YOU CAN TAKE THAT TO THE BANK.

84
00:05:00,726 --> 00:05:03,543
THIS GIRL STARTED HER COLLEGE
DURING COVID,

85
00:05:03,621 --> 00:05:08,483
HAD ME OUT HERE
PAYING $68,000 FOR TUITION,

86
00:05:08,483 --> 00:05:11,089
AND
SHE IN MY HOUSE TAKING CLASSES ON ZOOM

87
00:05:11,089 --> 00:05:14,709
AND LEARNING ABOUT THE
APPLIED HISTORY OF THE B.E.T.
AWARDS.

88
00:05:14,709 --> 00:05:18,644
MAN, IF SHE DON'T WALK, COLUMBIA
GOING TO BE ON THE NEWS FOR
SOMETHING ELSE.

89
00:05:18,644 --> 00:05:20,532
THAT'S ALL I KNOW.

90
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:24,940
AND LIVE FROM NEW YORK, IT'S
SATURDAY NIGHT!

91
00:07:27,867 --> 00:07:32,636
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, DUA LIPA!

92
00:07:51,668 --> 00:07:56,538
MUCH.

93
00:07:57,316 --> 00:08:00,425
MY NAME IS DUA LIPA.

94
00:08:00,425 --> 00:08:04,443
OR AS SOME PEOPLE CALL ME, DULA
PEEP.

95
00:08:04,547 --> 00:08:07,279
BUT DUA LIPA IS MY REAL NAME.

96
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:09,344
DUA IS ALBANIAN FOR LOVE,

97
00:08:09,344 --> 00:08:13,793
AND LIPA IS ALBANIAN FOR -- MY LAST
NAME.

98
00:08:13,793 --> 00:08:16,028
IT'S GREAT TO BE BACK IN 30
ROCK.

99
00:08:16,028 --> 00:08:18,194
I ACTUALLY MADE MY U.S. TV DEBUT

100
00:08:18,194 --> 00:08:20,933
EIGHT YEARS AGO
DOWNSTAIRS ON
THE TONIGHT SHOW.

101
00:08:20,933 --> 00:08:24,297
SO THIS BUILDING DOES FEEL A LOT
LIKE HOME.

102
00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:30,090
AND ESPECIALLY TONIGHT, BECAUSE
MY PARENTS ARE HERE IN THE
AUDIENCE.

103
00:08:34,146 --> 00:08:38,693
AS YOU CAN SEE, THEY'RE KIND OF
COOL.
THEY LOVE TO PARTY.

104
00:08:38,693 --> 00:08:42,980
ONE NIGHT, I WAS OUT WITH MY
FRIENDS AND WE ENDED UP AT THE
CLUB AT 3:00 IN THE MORNING

105
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:46,070
AND
WHO DO I BUMP INTO BUT MY
PARENTS,

106
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:49,663
WHICH WAS EMBARRASSING
BECAUSE THE LAST THING YOU WANT TO SEE

107
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:53,474
WHEN YOU'RE SUPER HIGH
AND DRUNK OFF YOUR ASS IS YOUR
DAUGHTER.

108
00:08:55,438 --> 00:08:59,650
BUT REALLY, THEY'VE ALWAYS BEEN
SO SUPPORTIVE.

109
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:04,003
THEY LET ME MOVE TO LONDON WHEN
I WAS JUST 15 TO START MY CAREER,

110
00:09:04,003 --> 00:09:08,205
AND NOW MY THIRD ALBUM
JUST DROPPED, AND IT'S CALLED
RADICAL OPTIMISM.

111
00:09:09,563 --> 00:09:13,629
THE A LOT OF
PEOPLE ASK ME WHAT THAT MEANS.

112
00:09:13,629 --> 00:09:16,996
TO ME, IT'S LIKE LOOKING ON THE
BRIGHT SIDE OF ANY SITUATION.

113
00:09:16,996 --> 00:09:18,597
HERE, I'LL SHOW YOU.

114
00:09:18,597 --> 00:09:21,993
SOMEONE TELL ME A PROBLEM YOU'RE
HAVING.

115
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:24,905
YES, YOU, SIR.

116
00:09:24,905 --> 00:09:27,378
>> HI.
MY WIFE LEFT ME

117
00:09:27,378 --> 00:09:31,254
BECAUSE DURING
SEX, I ACCIDENTALLY CALLED HER
MOM.

118
00:09:31,254 --> 00:09:35,820
>> WELL, ON THE BRIGHT SIDE, NOW
YOU'LL HAVE MORE TIME TO SPEND
WITH YOUR MOM.

119
00:09:35,901 --> 00:09:38,286
SEE?
RADICAL OPTIMISM.

120
00:09:38,286 --> 00:09:40,337
OKAY.
SOMEONE ELSE.
YOU.

121
00:09:40,337 --> 00:09:42,422
>> YES, HELLO, DUA.

122
00:09:42,422 --> 00:09:46,406
YESTERDAY I WENT TO THE DOCTOR,
AND SHE SAID --

123
00:09:46,406 --> 00:09:49,180
YES, MY DOCTOR IS A WOMAN --

124
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:52,827
ANYWAY, THAT BITCH
SAID I HAD TO STOP DRINKING.

125
00:09:52,827 --> 00:09:56,682
>> WELL, ON THE BRIGHT SIDE,
THERE'S ALWAYS POPPERS.

126
00:09:56,682 --> 00:10:00,292
SEE.
YOU CAN PUT A POSITIVE SPIN ON
ANYTHING.

127
00:10:00,292 --> 00:10:02,101
YES, YOU.

128
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:05,034
>> HI.
I'M SOUTH DAKOTA GOVERNOR KRISTI
NOEM.

129
00:10:05,034 --> 00:10:06,626
>> NO, NO, SORRY.

130
00:10:06,626 --> 00:10:09,076
I CAN'T HELP.

131
00:10:10,327 --> 00:10:15,379
LOOK, WE ALL HAVE PROBLEMS, EVEN
ME.

132
00:10:15,379 --> 00:10:20,316
LIKE THERE'S PEOPLE ONLINE WHO
SAY, DUA LIPA IS ALWAYS ON
VACATION.

133
00:10:20,316 --> 00:10:21,917
WHICH IS TOTALLY WRONG

134
00:10:21,917 --> 00:10:24,569
BECAUSE I'M BRITISH, SO WE CALL IT A
HOLIDAY.

135
00:10:24,569 --> 00:10:27,828
AND THERE'S PEOPLE WHO CALLED MY
DANCING LAZY

136
00:10:27,828 --> 00:10:30,141
AND SAID, GO, GIRL,
GIVE US NOTHING.

137
00:10:30,141 --> 00:10:34,233
BUT I DIDN'T GIVE YOU NOTHING, I
GAVE YOU THE GREATEST MEME OF
ALL TIME.

138
00:10:34,311 --> 00:10:38,406
AND NOW, I'M HERE, I'M HOSTING,
I'M PERFORMING,

139
00:10:38,406 --> 00:10:42,402
I'M MAKING THE
WIGS, DEALING ADDERALL TO THE
WRITERS.
I'M DOING IT ALL.

140
00:10:42,402 --> 00:10:46,201
SO TONIGHT, I PROMISE I'M GOING
TO GIVE YOU EVERYTHING.

141
00:10:46,201 --> 00:10:49,528
WE'VE GOT A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU
TONIGHT.
I'M HERE,

142
00:10:49,603 --> 00:10:52,525
STICK

143
00:11:16,164 --> 00:11:16,351
HELP.

144
00:11:17,353 --> 00:11:19,086
MY NAME IS YOUNG SPICY.

145

00:23:10,189 --> 00:23:10,955
LEARNED SO FAR?

483
00:23:10,957 --> 00:23:14,225
>> WELL, HERE'S ONE CLUE ON THE

484
00:23:14,227 --> 00:23:16,994
SONG EUPHORIA WHEN KENDRICK

485
00:23:16,996 --> 00:23:18,729
DESCRIBES DRAKE AS CANADIAN,

486
00:23:18,731 --> 00:23:22,566
THAT'S BECAUSE DRAKE IS FROM

487
00:23:22,568 --> 00:23:22,933
TORONTO.

488
00:23:22,935 --> 00:23:23,634
>> OH.

489
00:23:23,636 --> 00:23:24,001
>> OKAY.

490
00:23:24,003 --> 00:23:24,368
>> OKAY.

491
00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:27,171
>> AND HE CALLS DRAKE CRODIE,

492
00:23:27,173 --> 00:23:30,007
WHICH IS A TERM USED BY THE

493
00:23:30,009 --> 00:23:30,941
CRIPS, WHICH ACCORDING TO

494
00:23:30,943 --> 00:23:32,510
WIKAPEDIA IS AN ALLIANCE OF

495
00:23:32,512 --> 00:23:34,779

00:23:34,781 --> 00:23:35,179
CALIFORNIA.

497
00:23:35,181 --> 00:23:37,248
>> I THINK I KNOW THE CRIPS.

498
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:38,382
ARE THEY LIKE KROGER?

499
00:23:38,384 --> 00:23:38,883
>> NO.

500
00:23:38,885 --> 00:23:41,118
I THINK THAT'S A GROCERY STORE.

501
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,920
CRIPS SET UP THE CAMERAS ON

502
00:23:42,922 --> 00:23:43,721
MOVIE SETS.

503
00:23:43,723 --> 00:23:51,262
>> OH, OKAY.

504
00:23:51,264 --> 00:23:52,429
>> NOW, IN DRAKE'S DISS TRACK,

505
00:23:52,865 --> 00:23:54,698
QUESTIONED KENDRICK'S MANHOOD

506
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:56,934
SAYING HE WEARS A SIZE SEVEN

507
00:23:56,936 --> 00:23:57,234
SHOE.

508
00:23:57,236 --> 00:23:58,035
>> I DON'T GET THAT.

509
00:23:58,037 --> 00:23:59,103
I WEAR A SIZE FIVE.

510
00:23:59,105 --> 00:24:00,805
>> AND IT'S A WOMEN'S FIVE, SO

511
00:24:00,807 --> 00:24:02,106
IT'S A MAN'S THREE.

512
00:24:02,108 --> 00:24:03,974
>> A MAN'S THREE, CORRECT.

513
00:24:03,976 --> 00:24:09,213
>> BUT NOW, DRAKE IS BEING SUED

514
00:24:09,215 --> 00:24:11,849
BY 2 PAC'S ESTATE FOR USING AN

515
00:24:11,851 --> 00:24:13,184
AI VERSION OF HIS VOICE.

516
00:24:13,186 --> 00:24:15,152
>> FUNNY YOU SHOULD MENTION AI

517
00:24:15,154 --> 00:24:17,121
BECAUSE WE HAVE SOME AI THAT CAN

518
00:24:17,123 --> 00:24:19,190
SETTLE THIS SILLY FEUD ONCE AND

519
00:24:19,192 --> 00:24:19,924
FOR ALL.

520
00:24:19,926 --> 00:24:21,158
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, PLEASE

521
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:21,826
WELCOME KENDRICK LAMAR AND

00:24:36,542 --> 00:24:39,109
ALL THIS MEAN STUFF ABOUT ME?

528
00:24:39,111 --> 00:24:41,779
>> YOU KNOW WHAT, YOU'RE RIGHT.

529
00:24:41,781 --> 00:24:44,315
SHAME ON ME FOR DOING THOSE MEAN

530
00:24:44,317 --> 00:24:45,583
RAPS ABOUT YOU.

533
00:24:49,889 --> 00:24:51,922
SHAME ON ME TOO, I SUPPOSE.

534
00:24:51,924 --> 00:24:54,358
>> OH, AND I TAKE BACK WHAT I

535
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:55,926
SAID IN MY SONG.

536
00:24:55,928 --> 00:24:58,062
YOU CAN SAY THE N WORD.

537
00:24:58,064 --> 00:25:00,564
>> OOH, I THINK I WILL.

538
00:25:00,566 --> 00:25:01,365
>> WELL, COME ON THEN.

539
00:25:01,367 --> 00:25:09,607
LET'S SAY IT TOGETHER.

540
00:25:09,609 --> 00:25:10,608

545
00:25:18,317 --> 00:25:20,384
PLAY A NEW CELEBRITY GAME

546
00:25:20,386 --> 00:25:22,720
INSPIRED BY KENDRICK'S SONG.

547
00:25:22,722 --> 00:25:24,855
WE'LL HAVE TO DECIDE IF THE

548
00:25:24,857 --> 00:25:28,259
CELEBRITY IS BLACK OR NOT BLACK.

549
00:25:28,261 --> 00:25:29,560
>> HONESTLY, I CAN'T WAIT TO

550
00:25:29,562 --> 00:25:32,329
HEAR YOUR ANSWERS, YEAH.

551

YOU KNOW, MOST OF THE GIRLS I

>> OH, MY LAMP THAT LOOKS LIKE

564
00:26:23,549 --> 00:26:23,847
BREAD?

565
00:26:23,849 --> 00:26:24,748
I KNOW, IT'S FUNNY BECAUSE IT'S

566
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:27,251
A LAMP.

567
00:26:27,253 --> 00:26:28,052
>> NO.

568
00:26:28,054 --> 00:26:30,120
YOUR WALL OF WHAT LOOKS LIKE 500

569
00:26:30,122 --> 00:26:34,959
NAKED TOY DOLLS.

ANGELS.

572
00:26:40,099 --> 00:26:41,699
AND IT'S NOT 500.

573
00:26:41,701 --> 00:26:45,102
IT'S NOT EVEN THE FULL 650 THAT

574
00:26:45,104 --> 00:26:46,103
YOU CAN COLLECT.

575
00:26:46,105 --> 00:26:47,404
AND THEY'RE NOT NAKED.

576
00:26:47,406 --> 00:26:49,473
THEY'RE WEARING TINY LITTLE

577
00:26:49,475 --> 00:26:49,773
HATS.

578
00:26:49,775 --> 00:26:51,508
AREN'T THEY SO CUTE?

579
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:52,176
>> YEAH.

WHAT ARE THEY?

583
00:26:58,284 --> 00:26:59,950
>> SUNNY ANGELS.

584
00:26:59,952 --> 00:27:00,951
THEY'RE HUGE.

585
00:27:00,953 --> 00:27:04,021
THEY'RE COMPANIONS FOR LONELY

586
00:27:04,023 --> 00:27:04,755
25-YEAR-OLD WORKING WOMEN.

587
00:27:04,757 --> 00:27:05,723
>> THAT'S SO SPECIFIC.

588
00:27:05,725 --> 00:27:06,857
>> DON'T DISRUPT.

589
00:27:06,859 --> 00:27:08,959
LOOK, IT SAYS IT ON THE BOX.

590
00:27:08,961 --> 00:27:11,161
SUNNY ANGELS ARE LITTLE

591
00:27:11,163 --> 00:27:11,562
BOYFRIENDS.

592
00:27:11,564 --> 00:27:12,596
I'M OBSESSED WITH THEM.

593
00:27:12,598 --> 00:27:14,198
>> LITTLE BOYFRIENDS, HUH?

594
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:14,765
I GUESS I'VE GOT SOME

595
00:27:14,767 --> 00:27:17,301
COMPETITION.

596
00:27:17,303 --> 00:27:19,203
>> COMPETITION, OF COURSE NOT.

597
00:27:19,205 --> 00:27:20,838
THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

598
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:21,672
NOT WITH ALL OF THEM.

599
00:27:21,674 --> 00:27:24,942
JUST WITH HIM.

600
00:27:24,944 --> 00:27:27,011
>> HEY.

601
00:27:27,013 --> 00:27:28,545
I'M HER LITTLE BOYFRIEND.

602
00:27:28,547 --> 00:27:29,213
>> WHOA.

603
00:27:29,215 --> 00:27:29,747
THEY CAN TALK?

604
00:27:29,749 --> 00:27:30,214
>> THAT ONE CAN.

605
00:27:30,216 --> 00:27:33,050
HE'S SPECIAL.

606
00:27:33,052 --> 00:27:35,019
>> BECAUSE I'M HER LITTLE

607
00:27:35,021 --> 00:27:35,386
BOYFRIEND.

608
00:27:35,388 --> 00:27:36,887
I'M PART OF THE SUNNY ANGELS

609
00:27:36,889 --> 00:27:38,856
FRUIT SERIES, AND JUDGING BY THE

00:27:38,858 --> 00:27:39,590
WAY YOU DRESS, YOU'RE A FRUIT

611
00:27:39,592 --> 00:27:42,626
TOO.

612
00:27:42,628 --> 00:27:44,161
>> NICE GRAPES.

613
00:27:44,163 --> 00:27:45,863
I ALMOST DIDN'T NOTICE THEM OVER

614
00:27:45,865 --> 00:27:48,832
YOUR EXTREMELY LITTLE PENIS AND

615
00:27:48,834 --> 00:27:50,034
PERFECTLY SMOOTH BELLY BODY.

616
00:27:50,036 --> 00:27:53,404
>> OOH, SOMEONE'S JEALOUS.

617
00:27:53,406 --> 00:27:54,405
>> I'M SORRY.

618
00:27:54,407 --> 00:27:55,005
IS THIS THE MUSIC FROM

619
00:27:55,007 --> 00:27:55,839
CHALLENGERS?

620
00:27:55,841 --> 00:27:59,343
>> IT IS.

621
00:27:59,345 --> 00:28:02,279
THE SCORE IS STRESSFUL, BUT

622
00:28:02,281 --> 00:28:03,347
HORNY TOO.

623
00:28:03,349 --> 00:28:03,981
>> COOL.

624
00:28:03,983 --> 00:28:06,383
I HAVEN'T SEEN THE MOVIE.

625
00:28:06,385 --> 00:28:07,317
>> WELL, DON'T WORRY BECAUSE

626
00:28:07,319 --> 00:28:08,218
YOU'RE ABOUT TO LIVE IT.

627
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:11,221
>> THIS IS GREAT.

628
00:28:11,223 --> 00:28:13,257
I LOVE THAT YOU'RE VOLLEYING

629
00:28:13,259 --> 00:28:13,957
BACK AND FORTH.

630
00:28:13,959 --> 00:28:17,327
IT'S LIKE A TENNIS MATCH.

631
00:28:17,329 --> 00:28:19,563
HERE, YOU TWO SIT ON THE COUCH.

632
00:28:19,565 --> 00:28:20,731
>> JUST THE TWO OF US?

633
00:28:20,733 --> 00:28:22,366
>> I'M GOING TO GO FIX US A

634
00:28:22,368 --> 00:28:22,666
SNACK.

635
00:28:22,668 --> 00:28:30,274
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

636
00:28:30,276 --> 00:28:30,908
>> JUST TELL ME THE TRUTH.

637
00:28:30,910 --> 00:28:31,875
HAVE YOU GUYS HOOKED UP?

638
00:28:31,877 --> 00:28:33,877
>> DUDE, I'M NOT ANSWERING THAT.

639
00:28:33,879 --> 00:28:35,979
>> IT'S NOT LIKE I CARE.

640
00:28:35,981 --> 00:28:36,713
JUST TELL ME.

641
00:28:36,715 --> 00:28:37,915
>> I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT THAT

642
00:28:37,917 --> 00:28:38,782
WITH YOU, MAN.

643
00:28:38,784 --> 00:28:40,050
>> OKAY.

644
00:28:40,052 --> 00:28:40,350
FINE.

645
00:28:40,352 --> 00:28:43,253
JUST GIVE ME A SIGNAL.

646
00:28:43,255 --> 00:28:45,422
IF YOU'VE SLEPT WITH HER, DO

647
00:28:45,424 --> 00:28:46,957
YOUR LITTLE POSE WITH YOUR ARMS

648
00:28:46,959 --> 00:28:48,826
AND LOOK TO THE LEFT LIKE THIS.

649
00:28:48,828 --> 00:28:52,629
>> WELL, I DON'T KISS AND TELL,

650
00:28:52,631 --> 00:28:52,963
BUT --

993
00:40:55,887 --> 00:40:56,586
ANIMALS IS JUST MEDIA SPIN.

994

999
00:41:01,026 --> 00:41:03,993
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT MEDIA SPIN IS?

1000
00:41:03,995 --> 00:41:06,763

1001
00:41:06,765 --> 00:41:07,096
PROBLEM.

1002
00:41:07,098 --> 00:41:08,298
BARKING, EATING EVERY DAY.

1003
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:09,265
WHO DOES THAT?

1004
00:41:09,267 --> 00:41:11,901
IF SHE DIDN'T KILL HIM, I WOULD.

1005
00:41:11,903 --> 00:41:13,736
>> WOW.

1006

PLEASE, I LOVE YOU, KRISTI.

1010
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:22,979
>> ALL RIGHT.

1011
00:41:22,981 --> 00:41:26,583
JUST SEEMS UNDERNEATH IT LIKE

1012
00:41:26,585 --> 00:41:28,685
YOU'RE A LITTLE SCARED.

1013
00:41:28,687 --> 00:41:29,452
>> SCARED?

1014
00:41:29,454 --> 00:41:30,486
I'M NOT SCARED.

1015
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:32,288
I HAVE A GREAT LIFE.

1016
00:41:32,290 --> 00:41:34,324
SHE GIVES ME SO MANY TOYS.

1017
00:41:34,326 --> 00:41:38,261
SHE EVEN GAVE ME A DOG BUTTON

1018
00:41:38,263 --> 00:41:38,528
MAP.

1019
00:41:38,530 --> 00:41:41,864

CHECK IT OUT.

1021
00:41:42,834 --> 00:41:45,702
SHE, IS, GOING, TO, KILL, ME.

1022
00:41:45,704 --> 00:41:46,669
>> CRICKET.

1023
00:41:46,671 --> 00:41:47,370
>> WHAT?

1024
00:41:47,372 --> 00:41:49,272
THESE ARE LIKE BROKEN OR

THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEANT TO SAY.

1027
00:41:52,978 --> 00:41:54,377
I, DIE, TONIGHT.

1028
00:41:54,379 --> 00:41:56,112

MY POINT IS THAT SHE'S THE BEST.

1037
00:42:06,992 --> 00:42:09,225
IT'S LIKE THEY SAY, I DON'T KNOW

1038
00:42:09,227 --> 00:42:10,493
IF SHE RESCUED ME OR IF I'M

1039
00:42:10,495 --> 00:42:13,263
GOING TO GET SHOT IN THE FACE.

1040

CRICKET, YOU KNOW KRISTI WELL.

1042
00:42:18,103 --> 00:42:19,469
WHY DO YOU THINK SHE WROTE THESE

1043
00:42:19,471 --> 00:42:20,737
STORIES IN HER BOOK?

1044
