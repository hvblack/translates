1
00:00:01,338 --> 00:00:04,988
>>> YOU'RE WATCHING NEW YORK ONE
BECAUSE YOUR WI-FI IS DOWN.

2
00:00:04,988 --> 00:00:09,732
LATER, A RECAP OF HOPE HICKS'
EMOTIONAL TESTIMONY IN DONALD
TRUMP'S HUSH MONEY TRIAL.

3
00:00:09,732 --> 00:00:13,864
FIRST, IT'S COMMUNITY AFFAIRS
WITH RYAN ABERNATHY.

4
00:00:18,763 --> 00:00:23,654
>>> GOOD EVENING AND WELCOME TO
COMMUNITY AFFAIRS.
I'M RYAN ABERNATHY.

5
00:00:23,654 --> 00:00:29,030
COLLEGE STUDENTS HAVE BEEN
PROTESTING ON CAMPUSES ACROSS
THE NATION.

6
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:33,727
TONIGHT WE'LL BE DISCUSSING WITH
MY GUESTS WHO ARE PARENT
STUDENTS OF COLLEGES IN NEW
YORK.

7
00:00:33,727 --> 00:00:37,047
JOIN ME IN WELCOMING THE NEW
STUDENT PARENT, DOUG HOVING.

8
00:00:37,092 --> 00:00:39,077
HI

9
00:00:39,077 --> 00:00:41,111
SARAH HIMES.

10
00:00:41,111 --> 00:00:43,006
>> HI.
THANKS FOR HAVING ME.

11
00:00:43,006 --> 00:00:45,978
>> AND COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY DAD,
ALPHONSE ROBERTS.

12
00:00:45,978 --> 00:00:49,104
>> HI, RYAN, AND HELLO TO MY
WIFE.

13
00:00:50,139 --> 00:00:53,606
THANK

14
00:00:53,606 --> 00:00:57,910
AS PARENTS, HOW DO YOU FEEL
ABOUT THESE PROTESTS ON CAMPUS?
SARAH, WE'LL START WITH YOU.

15
00:00:57,910 --> 00:01:02,900
>> FOR ME, IT'S BEEN TOUGH.
I'M ALL FOR FREE SPEECH,

16
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:06,135
BUT I
DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY THINK
THEY'RE ACCOMPLISHING,

17
00:01:06,135 --> 00:01:09,429
AND
THAT'S REALLY PUTTING A STRAIN
ON ME AND MY DAUGHTER'S
RELATIONSHIP.

18
00:01:09,429 --> 00:01:12,332
>> YEAH.
I WANT TO LET ME SON MAKE HIS
OWN CHOICES,

19
00:01:12,332 --> 00:01:14,628
BUT TO BE HONEST,
IT'S A LITTLE SCARY.

20
00:01:14,628 --> 00:01:17,425
THESE PROTESTS ARE BECOMING WAY
MORE AGGRESSIVE.

21
00:01:17,425 --> 00:01:21,149
>> RIGHT.
BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY, MY
DAUGHTER IS AN ADULT

22
00:01:21,149 --> 00:01:23,004
AND HAS TO
LIVE HER OWN LIFE.

23
00:01:23,004 --> 00:01:26,412
>> WELL, I THINK IT'S JUST
GREAT.
IT'S WONDERFUL.

24
00:01:26,412 --> 00:01:30,637
NOTHING MAKES ME PROUDER THAN
YOUNG PEOPLE USING THEIR VOICES
TO FIGHT FOR WHAT THEY BELIEVE?

25
00:01:30,637 --> 00:01:32,809
>> WOW.
THAT'S VERY ENCOURAGING.

26
00:01:32,809 --> 00:01:36,177
>> YOUR DAUGHTER MUST FEEL SO
SUPPORTED WHEN SHE'S OUT THERE.

27
00:01:36,177 --> 00:01:38,593
>> WHAT'S THAT NOW?

28
00:01:38,593 --> 00:01:41,469
WHEN WHOSE DAUGHTER IS OUT
THERE?

29
00:01:41,469 --> 00:01:42,812
>> AT THE PROTEST.

30
00:01:42,812 --> 00:01:46,566
>> NO, NO, NO.
HUH-HUH, MAN.
YOU BUGGEN.

31
00:01:46,566 --> 00:01:50,716
ALEXIS VANESSA ROBERTS BETTER
HAVE HER BUTT IN CLASS.

32
00:01:50,716 --> 00:01:55,866
LET ME FIND OUT SHE IN ONE OF
THEM DAMN TENTS INSTEAD THE DORM
ROOM THAT I PAY FOR.

33
00:01:55,866 --> 00:01:59,406
>> I THOUGHT YOU WERE IN FAVOR
OF THE STUDENT PROTESTS?

34
00:01:59,406 --> 00:02:05,296
>> BROTHER MAN, I AM SUPPORTIVE
OF Y'ALL'S KIDS PROTESTING, NOT
MY KIDS.

35
00:02:05,296 --> 00:02:09,460
MY KIDS KNOW BETTER.
SHOOT, ALEXIS VANESSA AIN'T
CRAZY.

36
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:12,332
>> YOUR DAUGHTER ATTENDS COLUMN
BOO I CAN'T.

37
00:02:12,332 --> 00:02:15,010
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THE
STUDENTS THAT TOOK OVER HAMILTON
HALL?

38
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:17,905
>> THAT'S GOOD FOR Y'ALL'S KIDS,

39
00:02:17,905 --> 00:02:22,328
BUT THEY AIN'T MINE.
YOU FEEL ME, RYAN?

40
00:02:22,328 --> 00:02:25,279
>> YES, I FEEL YOU, ALPHONSE.

41
00:02:25,279 --> 00:02:28,580
TELL ME, WITH THE RISE IN
ATTENDANCE IN THIS PROTEST,

42
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:31,220
HOW
DOES IT MAKE YOU FEEL ABOUT THE
POLICE PRESENCE?

43
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:35,737
SARAH
>> I'M VERY CONCERNED.

44
00:02:35,737 --> 00:02:39,379
ONE OF MY WORST FEARS IS MY
DAUGHTER BEING THROWN BEHIND
BAR.

45
00:02:39,379 --> 00:02:41,406
THIS IS A CRUCIAL TIME IN HER LIFE,

46
00:02:41,406 --> 00:02:45,804
AND I WOULD HATE FOR HER
TO HAVE AN ARREST FOLLOW HER
FOREVER.

47
00:02:45,804 --> 00:02:49,558
>> MAN, I AIN'T WORRIED ABOUT
5-0.

48
00:02:49,558 --> 00:02:51,496
THAT IS NOT MY BUSINESS.

49
00:02:51,496 --> 00:02:54,808
MY BUSINESS IS ALEXIS VANESSA

50
00:02:54,808 --> 00:02:56,995
FREE

51
00:02:56,995 --> 00:03:00,001
COLUMBIA

52
00:03:02,329 --> 00:03:03,846
SHOOT

53
00:03:03,846 --> 00:03:09,556
DO Y'ALL KNOW THAT THEY GOT THE
NERVE TO WANT 68,000 A YEAR.

54
00:03:09,556 --> 00:03:12,660
>> I MEAN, WE TOTALLY RESPECT
THEIR RIGHT TO PROTEST,

55
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:15,606
BUT I
MEAN WE'RE ALSO MAKING
SACRIFICES FOR OUR KIDS.

56
00:03:15,606 --> 00:03:19,468
>> YEAH.
I'M OUT HERE BUSTING MY HUMP TO
PAY ALL THAT TUITION.

57
00:03:19,468 --> 00:03:22,830
>> WHAT DO YOU DO FOR A LIVING?
>> SISTER GIRL, I DO IT ALL.

58
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:26,644
UBER ALL DAY, UBER EATS ALL NIGHT,

59
00:03:26,644 --> 00:03:30,460
CUT GRASS ON THE
WEEKENDS, SELL GUCCI WALLETS OUT MY TRUNK,

60
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:35,261
LIFE COACHING ON IG.
I BOUNTY HUNT WHENEVER POSSIBLE.

61
00:03:35,261 --> 00:03:39,623
ALL THAT SO SHE CAN SAY SHE GOT
A DEGREE IN AFRICAN-AMERICAN
STUDIES.

62
00:03:39,623 --> 00:03:46,295
LOOK, GIRL, YOU BEEN BLACK YOUR
WHOLE LIFE.
YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS.

63
00:03:46,295 --> 00:03:49,998
>> THAT'S QUITE AN INVESTMENT IN
YOUR DAUGHTER.
>> DAMN SKIPPY IT IS.

64
00:03:49,998 --> 00:03:52,642
SHE'S GIFTED, THOUGH.

65
00:03:52,642 --> 00:03:55,965
SHE GON' CHANGE THE WORLD.
SHE DAMN SURE BETTER.

66
00:03:55,965 --> 00:03:58,602
>> I'M SURE SHE WILL.

67
00:03:58,602 --> 00:04:01,130
>> YES, YES, SHE WILL.

68
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:03,801
SHE'S WORTH EVERY PENNY,

69
00:04:03,801 --> 00:04:08,635
AND I KNOW I SOUND MAD RIGHT ABOUT
NOW, BUT YOU JUST WAIT UNTIL GRADUATION

70
00:04:08,635 --> 00:04:13,680
WHEN YOU SEE THAT
SMILE ACROSS MY FACE WHEN I HEAR
THAT NAME ALEXIS VANESSA ROBERTS

71
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,677
AND I WATCH HER WALK ACROSS THAT
STAGE.

72
00:04:16,678 --> 00:04:18,652
DON'T GET

73
00:04:18,652 --> 00:04:24,160
I ACTUALLY HEARD A FEW
SCHOOLS ARE FULLY CANCELING
THEIR GRADUATION CEREMONIES.

74
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,051
>> SISTER GIRL, I DON'T THINK
YOU GET IT.

75
00:04:27,051 --> 00:04:32,477
ALEXIS VANESSA WILL BE
GRADUATED, EVEN IF I GOT TO DO
IT MYSELF.

76
00:04:32,477 --> 00:04:37,779
BELIEVE ME WHEN I TELL YOU THAT
AT THE END OF THIS MONTH,
I AM
PUTTING ON MY CHURCH CLOTHES,

77
00:04:37,779 --> 00:04:42,115
THREE PUMPS ON COOL WATER
COLOGNE, SMELLING GOOD AS A MUG,

78
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:47,747
AND THEN, BAM, I'M HOPPING IN MY
'98 FORD EXPLORER, BLASTING SOME ANITA BAKER,

79
00:04:47,747 --> 00:04:51,789
AND YOU BETTER
BELIEVE I'M GOING TO BE IN THERE
HOOTING AND HOLLERING

80
00:04:51,789 --> 00:04:54,873
AFTER THEY
EXPLICITLY TOLD US TO WAIT UNTIL
THE END.

81
00:04:54,873 --> 00:04:56,557
THAT'S ALL I KNOW.

82
00:04:56,625 --> 00:04:58,774
>> WOW.
GOT IT ALL PLANNED OUT.

83
00:04:58,774 --> 00:05:00,643
>> YEAH.
YOU CAN TAKE THAT TO THE BANK.

84
00:05:00,726 --> 00:05:03,543
THIS GIRL STARTED HER COLLEGE
DURING COVID,

85
00:05:03,621 --> 00:05:08,483
HAD ME OUT HERE
PAYING $68,000 FOR TUITION,

86
00:05:08,483 --> 00:05:11,089
AND
SHE IN MY HOUSE TAKING CLASSES ON ZOOM

87
00:05:11,089 --> 00:05:14,709
AND LEARNING ABOUT THE
APPLIED HISTORY OF THE B.E.T.
AWARDS.

88
00:05:14,709 --> 00:05:18,644
MAN, IF SHE DON'T WALK, COLUMBIA
GOING TO BE ON THE NEWS FOR
SOMETHING ELSE.

89
00:05:18,644 --> 00:05:20,532
THAT'S ALL I KNOW.

90
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:24,940
AND LIVE FROM NEW YORK, IT'S
SATURDAY NIGHT!

91
00:07:27,867 --> 00:07:32,636
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, DUA LIPA!

92
00:07:51,668 --> 00:07:56,538
MUCH.

93
00:07:57,316 --> 00:08:00,425
MY NAME IS DUA LIPA.

94
00:08:00,425 --> 00:08:04,443
OR AS SOME PEOPLE CALL ME, DULA
PEEP.

95
00:08:04,547 --> 00:08:07,279
BUT DUA LIPA IS MY REAL NAME.

96
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:09,344
DUA IS ALBANIAN FOR LOVE,

97
00:08:09,344 --> 00:08:13,793
AND LIPA IS ALBANIAN FOR -- MY LAST
NAME.

98
00:08:13,793 --> 00:08:16,028
IT'S GREAT TO BE BACK IN 30
ROCK.

99
00:08:16,028 --> 00:08:18,194
I ACTUALLY MADE MY U.S. TV DEBUT

100
00:08:18,194 --> 00:08:20,933
EIGHT YEARS AGO
DOWNSTAIRS ON
THE TONIGHT SHOW.

101
00:08:20,933 --> 00:08:24,297
SO THIS BUILDING DOES FEEL A LOT
LIKE HOME.

102
00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:30,090
AND ESPECIALLY TONIGHT, BECAUSE
MY PARENTS ARE HERE IN THE
AUDIENCE.

103
00:08:34,146 --> 00:08:38,693
AS YOU CAN SEE, THEY'RE KIND OF
COOL.
THEY LOVE TO PARTY.

104
00:08:38,693 --> 00:08:42,980
ONE NIGHT, I WAS OUT WITH MY
FRIENDS AND WE ENDED UP AT THE
CLUB AT 3:00 IN THE MORNING

105
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:46,070
AND
WHO DO I BUMP INTO BUT MY
PARENTS,

106
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:49,663
WHICH WAS EMBARRASSING
BECAUSE THE LAST THING YOU WANT TO SEE

107
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:53,474
WHEN YOU'RE SUPER HIGH
AND DRUNK OFF YOUR ASS IS YOUR
DAUGHTER.

108
00:08:55,438 --> 00:08:59,650
BUT REALLY, THEY'VE ALWAYS BEEN
SO SUPPORTIVE.

109
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:04,003
THEY LET ME MOVE TO LONDON WHEN
I WAS JUST 15 TO START MY CAREER,

110
00:09:04,003 --> 00:09:08,205
AND NOW MY THIRD ALBUM
JUST DROPPED, AND IT'S CALLED
RADICAL OPTIMISM.

111
00:09:09,563 --> 00:09:13,629
THE A LOT OF
PEOPLE ASK ME WHAT THAT MEANS.

112
00:09:13,629 --> 00:09:16,996
TO ME, IT'S LIKE LOOKING ON THE
BRIGHT SIDE OF ANY SITUATION.

113
00:09:16,996 --> 00:09:18,597
HERE, I'LL SHOW YOU.

114
00:09:18,597 --> 00:09:21,993
SOMEONE TELL ME A PROBLEM YOU'RE
HAVING.

115
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:24,905
YES, YOU, SIR.

116
00:09:24,905 --> 00:09:27,378
>> HI.
MY WIFE LEFT ME

117
00:09:27,378 --> 00:09:31,254
BECAUSE DURING
SEX, I ACCIDENTALLY CALLED HER
MOM.

118
00:09:31,254 --> 00:09:35,820
>> WELL, ON THE BRIGHT SIDE, NOW
YOU'LL HAVE MORE TIME TO SPEND
WITH YOUR MOM.

119
00:09:35,901 --> 00:09:38,286
SEE?
RADICAL OPTIMISM.

120
00:09:38,286 --> 00:09:40,337
OKAY.
SOMEONE ELSE.
YOU.

121
00:09:40,337 --> 00:09:42,422
>> YES, HELLO, DUA.

122
00:09:42,422 --> 00:09:46,406
YESTERDAY I WENT TO THE DOCTOR,
AND SHE SAID --

123
00:09:46,406 --> 00:09:49,180
YES, MY DOCTOR IS A WOMAN --

124
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:52,827
ANYWAY, THAT BITCH
SAID I HAD TO STOP DRINKING.

125
00:09:52,827 --> 00:09:56,682
>> WELL, ON THE BRIGHT SIDE,
THERE'S ALWAYS POPPERS.

126
00:09:56,682 --> 00:10:00,292
SEE.
YOU CAN PUT A POSITIVE SPIN ON
ANYTHING.

127
00:10:00,292 --> 00:10:02,101
YES, YOU.

128
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:05,034
>> HI.
I'M SOUTH DAKOTA GOVERNOR KRISTI
NOEM.

129
00:10:05,034 --> 00:10:06,626
>> NO, NO, SORRY.

130
00:10:06,626 --> 00:10:09,076
I CAN'T HELP.

131
00:10:10,327 --> 00:10:15,379
LOOK, WE ALL HAVE PROBLEMS, EVEN
ME.

132
00:10:15,379 --> 00:10:20,316
LIKE THERE'S PEOPLE ONLINE WHO
SAY, DUA LIPA IS ALWAYS ON
VACATION.

133
00:10:20,316 --> 00:10:21,917
WHICH IS TOTALLY WRONG

134
00:10:21,917 --> 00:10:24,569
BECAUSE I'M BRITISH, SO WE CALL IT A
HOLIDAY.

135
00:10:24,569 --> 00:10:27,828
AND THERE'S PEOPLE WHO CALLED MY
DANCING LAZY

136
00:10:27,828 --> 00:10:30,141
AND SAID, GO, GIRL,
GIVE US NOTHING.

137
00:10:30,141 --> 00:10:34,233
BUT I DIDN'T GIVE YOU NOTHING, I
GAVE YOU THE GREATEST MEME OF
ALL TIME.

138
00:10:34,311 --> 00:10:38,406
AND NOW, I'M HERE, I'M HOSTING,
I'M PERFORMING,

139
00:10:38,406 --> 00:10:42,402
I'M MAKING THE
WIGS, DEALING ADDERALL TO THE
WRITERS.
I'M DOING IT ALL.

140
00:10:42,402 --> 00:10:46,201
SO TONIGHT, I PROMISE I'M GOING
TO GIVE YOU EVERYTHING.

141
00:10:46,201 --> 00:10:49,528
WE'VE GOT A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU
TONIGHT.
I'M HERE,

142
00:10:49,603 --> 00:10:52,525
STICK

143
00:11:16,164 --> 00:11:16,351
HELP.

144
00:11:17,353 --> 00:11:19,086
MY NAME IS YOUNG SPICY.

145

481
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:30,382
ARE THEY LIKE KROGER?

482
00:23:30,384 --> 00:23:30,883
>> NO.

483
00:23:30,885 --> 00:23:33,118
I THINK THAT'S A GROCERY STORE.

00:23:50,037 --> 00:23:51,103
I WEAR A SIZE FIVE.

493
00:23:51,105 --> 00:23:52,805
>> AND IT'S A WOMEN'S FIVE, SO

494
00:23:52,807 --> 00:23:54,106
IT'S A MAN'S THREE.

495

YOU CAN SAY THE N WORD.

I KNOW, IT'S FUNNY BECAUSE IT'S

549
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:19,251
A LAMP.

550
00:26:19,253 --> 00:26:20,052
>> NO.

551
00:26:20,054 --> 00:26:22,120

AND IT'S NOT 500.

556
00:26:33,701 --> 00:26:37,102
IT'S NOT EVEN THE FULL 650 THAT

557
00:26:37,104 --> 00:26:38,103
YOU CAN COLLECT.

558
00:26:38,105 --> 00:26:39,404
AND THEY'RE NOT NAKED.

559
00:26:39,406 --> 00:26:41,473
THEY'RE WEARING TINY LITTLE

560
00:26:41,475 --> 00:26:41,773

00:26:51,952 --> 00:26:52,951
THEY'RE HUGE.

568
00:26:52,953 --> 00:26:56,021
THEY'RE COMPANIONS FOR LONELY

569

25-YEAR-OLD WORKING WOMEN.

570

I'M OBSESSED WITH THEM.

576
00:27:04,598 --> 00:27:06,198

577
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:06,765
I GUESS I'VE GOT SOME

578
00:27:06,767 --> 00:27:09,301
COMPETITION.

579
00:27:09,303 --> 00:27:11,203
>> COMPETITION, OF COURSE NOT.

580
00:27:11,205 --> 00:27:12,838
THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

581
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:13,672
NOT WITH ALL OF THEM.

582
00:27:13,674 --> 00:27:16,942
JUST WITH HIM.

583
00:27:16,944 --> 00:27:19,011
>> HEY.

584
00:27:19,013 --> 00:27:20,545

THEY CAN TALK?

587
00:27:21,749 --> 00:27:22,214
>> THAT ONE CAN.

588
00:27:22,216 --> 00:27:25,050
HE'S SPECIAL.

589
00:27:25,052 --> 00:27:27,019

595
00:27:34,628 --> 00:27:36,161
>> NICE GRAPES.

596
00:27:36,163 --> 00:27:37,863
I ALMOST DIDN'T NOTICE THEM OVER

597
00:27:37,865 --> 00:27:40,832

PERFECTLY SMOOTH BELLY BODY.

599
00:27:42,036 --> 00:27:45,404
>> OOH, SOMEONE'S JEALOUS.

600
00:27:45,406 --> 00:27:46,405
>> I'M SORRY.

601
00:27:46,407 --> 00:27:47,005
IS THIS THE MUSIC FROM

602
00:27:47,007 --> 00:27:47,839
CHALLENGERS?

603
00:27:47,841 --> 00:27:51,343
>> IT IS.

604
00:27:51,345 --> 00:27:54,279
THE SCORE IS STRESSFUL, BUT

605
00:27:54,281 --> 00:27:55,347
HORNY TOO.

606
00:27:55,349 --> 00:27:55,981
>> COOL.

607
00:27:55,983 --> 00:27:58,383
I HAVEN'T SEEN THE MOVIE.

608
00:27:58,385 --> 00:27:59,317
>> WELL, DON'T WORRY BECAUSE

609
00:27:59,319 --> 00:28:00,218
YOU'RE ABOUT TO LIVE IT.

610
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:03,221
>> THIS IS GREAT.

611
00:28:03,223 --> 00:28:05,257
I LOVE THAT YOU'RE VOLLEYING

00:28:05,959 --> 00:28:09,327
IT'S LIKE A TENNIS MATCH.

614
00:28:09,329 --> 00:28:11,563
HERE, YOU TWO SIT ON THE COUCH.

615
00:28:11,565 --> 00:28:12,731
>> JUST THE TWO OF US?

616
00:28:12,733 --> 00:28:14,366
>> I'M GOING TO GO FIX US A

617
00:28:14,368 --> 00:28:14,666
SNACK.

618
00:28:14,668 --> 00:28:22,274
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

619
00:28:22,276 --> 00:28:22,908
>> JUST TELL ME THE TRUTH.

620
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:23,875
HAVE YOU GUYS HOOKED UP?

621
00:28:23,877 --> 00:28:25,877
>> DUDE, I'M NOT ANSWERING THAT.

622
00:28:25,879 --> 00:28:27,979
>> IT'S NOT LIKE I CARE.

623
00:28:27,981 --> 00:28:28,713
JUST TELL ME.

624
00:28:28,715 --> 00:28:29,915
>> I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT THAT

625
00:28:29,917 --> 00:28:30,782
WITH YOU, MAN.

626
00:28:30,784 --> 00:28:32,050
>> OKAY.

627
00:28:32,052 --> 00:28:32,350
FINE.

628
00:28:32,352 --> 00:28:35,253
JUST GIVE ME A SIGNAL.

629
00:28:35,255 --> 00:28:37,422
IF YOU'VE SLEPT WITH HER, DO

630
00:28:37,424 --> 00:28:38,957
YOUR LITTLE POSE WITH YOUR ARMS

631
00:28:38,959 --> 00:28:40,826
AND LOOK TO THE LEFT LIKE THIS.

632
00:28:40,828 --> 00:28:44,629
>> WELL, I DON'T KISS AND TELL,

633
00:28:44,631 --> 00:28:44,963
BUT --

634
00:28:44,965 --> 00:28:45,664
>> WHOA!

635
00:28:45,666 --> 00:28:47,032
HOW WOULD THAT EVEN WORK?

636
00:28:47,034 --> 00:28:50,702
HOW OLD ARE YOU?

637
00:28:50,704 --> 00:28:53,271
>> I'M 41, OKAY, SO IT'S NOT

638
00:28:53,273 --> 00:28:53,605
WEIRD.

639
00:28:53,607 --> 00:28:56,441
>> YES, IT IS!

640
00:28:56,443 --> 00:28:57,142
>> FINALLY, TWO BOYS WHO CAN

641
00:28:57,144 --> 00:28:59,811
ACTUALLY COMPETE.

642
00:28:59,813 --> 00:29:00,112
OKAY.

643
00:29:00,114 --> 00:29:02,380
I'M BACK.

644
00:29:02,382 --> 00:29:07,819
WITH CHURROS.

645
00:29:07,821 --> 00:29:11,923
THE MOST PENIS DESERT.

646
00:29:11,925 --> 00:29:13,525
I SURE HOPE IT DOESN'T MAKE YOU

647
00:29:13,527 --> 00:29:15,994

>>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

00:36:31,782 --> 00:36:33,802
GOOD EVENING.
GOOD EVENING, EVERYONE.

821
00:36:33,802 --> 00:36:37,310
>> WELCOME TO "WEEKEND UPDATE."
I'M MICHAEL CHE.
>> I'M COLIN JOST.

822
00:36:37,882 --> 00:36:43,426
WELL, IT'S THE FIRST SHOW OF
SPRING, SO WE'LL START TONIGHT
WITH PUPPY MURDER.

823
00:36:43,426 --> 00:36:46,463
IN A NEW BOOK, SOUTH DAKOTA
GOVERNOR KRISTI NOEM REVEALED

824
00:36:46,463 --> 00:36:49,370
SHE ONCE SHOT A DOG THAT WAS
UNTRAINABLE.

825
00:36:49,370 --> 00:36:53,188
THAT'S INSANE.
IF A TO GO IS UNTRAINABLE, YOU
DON'T SHOOT IT.

826
00:36:53,188 --> 00:36:55,741
YOU GIVE IT TO PRESIDENT BIDEN.

827
00:36:57,332 --> 00:37:03,307
MAGA INSIDERS ARE SAYING NOEM,
SEEN HERE WEARING THE HAIR OF THAT DOG,

828
00:37:03,307 --> 00:37:06,758
 NOW HAS ZERO CHANCE OF
BEING TRUMP'S RUNNING MATE.

829
00:37:06,758 --> 00:37:09,686
I DON'T KNOW.
SOMETHING TELLS ME TRUMP WOULD
FULLY SUPPORT 

830
00:37:09,686 --> 00:37:12,638
KILLING
DISOBEDIENT PETS.

831
00:37:14,112 --> 00:37:18,377
>> INSIDERS SAID THAT DURING HIS
HUSH MONEY TRIAL, DONALD TRUMP COMPLAINED

832
00:37:18,377 --> 00:37:20,893
 THAT NONE OF HIS
SUPPORTERS WERE IN COURT WITH
HIM.

833
00:37:20,893 --> 00:37:24,194
THAT'S NOT TRUE.
WHAT ABOUT ALL THOSE COPS?

834
00:37:27,948 --> 00:37:32,494
>> FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP
SEEN HERE DEFINITELY NOT SLEEPING,

835
00:37:32,494 --> 00:37:34,849
 PROBABLY JUST PRAYING,

836
00:37:34,849 --> 00:37:39,713
FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP FOR THE
FIRST TIME IN HIS TRIAL WROTE A
MESSAGE ON A YELLOW POST-IT NOTE

837
00:37:39,713 --> 00:37:42,546
AND HANDED IT TO HIS LAWYER
WHILE HE WAS MAKING AN ARGUMENT.

838
00:37:42,546 --> 00:37:46,430
THE POST-IT READ SIMPLY, CAN'T
PAY YOU.

839
00:37:47,379 --> 00:37:50,304
>> OFFICIALS AT COLUMBIA
UNIVERSITY COMPLAINED

840
00:37:50,304 --> 00:37:53,486
 THAT
PROTESTORS BROKE WINDOWS AND
DESTROYED SCHOOL PROPERTY.

841
00:37:53,486 --> 00:37:57,607
SO WHAT, COLLEGES ALSO DO THAT
WHEN THEY WIN THE FINAL FOUR.

842
00:37:57,607 --> 00:38:02,551
ALSO, IF YOU DON'T WANT STUDENTS
TO FREAK OUT, STOP TELLING THEM
THE TRUTH.

843
00:38:02,551 --> 00:38:05,868
THAT'S MY ADVICE FOR SCHOOL AND
RELATIONSHIPS.

844
00:38:05,868 --> 00:38:11,558
PRESIDENT BIDEN SAID THE
NATIONAL GUARD SHOULD NOT BE
CALLED IN TO DEAL WITH CAMPUS
PROTESTS.

845
00:38:11,558 --> 00:38:17,032
I'M JUST HAPPY HE'S FINALLY NOT
SENDING MILITARY AID SOMEWHERE.

846
00:38:19,071 --> 00:38:22,472
THAT WAS MY BEST JOKE, COLIN.

847
00:38:22,644 --> 00:38:25,613
>> REPRESENTATIVE MARJORIE
TAYLOR GREEN SAID

848
00:38:25,613 --> 00:38:29,201
 NEXT WEEK SHE
WILL FORCE A VOTE TO OUST HOUSE
SENATOR MIKE JOHNSON.

849
00:38:29,201 --> 00:38:31,595
IF THERE'S ONE THING I BET SHE'S
AMAZING AT, 

850
00:38:31,595 --> 00:38:34,485
IT'S DRIVING MEN
AWAY.

851
00:38:34,685 --> 00:38:40,573
>> DURING A CAMPAIGN EVENT
MARKING THE START OF ASIAN
AMERICAN AND PACIFIC ISLANDER HERITAGE MONTH, 

852
00:38:40,573 --> 00:38:44,099
PRESIDENT BIDEN
CRITICIZED JAPAN AS BEING XENOPHOBIC,

853
00:38:44,099 --> 00:38:48,699
 WHICH IS CRAZY
BECAUSE WHY WOULD THE JAPANESE
BE SCARED OF FOREIGNERS?

854
00:38:50,513 --> 00:38:54,275
DRAKE JUST DROPPED ANOTHER DISS
RECORD, GUYS.

855
00:38:54,275 --> 00:38:58,034
JUST KIDDING.
I JUST SAY THAT WHEN I BOMB.

856
00:38:58,034 --> 00:39:01,804
>> FLORIDA'S NEW ABORTION BAN
MEANS THE MAJORITY OF WOMEN IN THE SOUTH

857
00:39:01,804 --> 00:39:05,171
 WILL HAVE TO TRAVEL
MORE THAN 300 MILES FOR THE
PROCEDURE.

858
00:39:05,171 --> 00:39:07,951
ON THE PLUS SIDE, YOU CAN GET
FREE TRAVEL TO NEW YORK 

859
00:39:07,951 --> 00:39:10,953
BY
DISGUISING YOURSELF AS A
MIGRANT.

860
00:39:11,819 --> 00:39:15,631
>> NEW POLLS SHOW THAT
SUPPORTERS OF PRESIDENT BIDEN
AND DONALD TRUMP

861
00:39:15,631 --> 00:39:18,792
 ARE SHARPLY
DIVIDED OVER WHERE THEY GET
THEIR NEWS.

862
00:39:18,792 --> 00:39:23,443
PEOPLE WHO SUPPORT BIDEN ARE
MORE LIKELY TO GET THEIR NEWS
FROM NEWSPAPERS AND MAIN STREAM MEDIA 

863
00:39:23,443 --> 00:39:25,978
WHILE TRUMP SUPPORTS GET
THEIRS FROM T-SHIRTS.

864
00:39:25,978 --> 00:39:28,385
SUCKS

865
00:39:28,385 --> 00:39:31,712
>> DONALD TRUMP TOLD SUPPORTERS
IF HE'S ELECTED,

866
00:39:31,712 --> 00:39:34,595
 HE WILL FOCUS
ON ANTI-WHITE RACISM.

867
00:39:34,595 --> 00:39:37,260
THANK GOD.

868
00:39:37,419 --> 00:39:41,455
MY PEOPLE HAVE SUFFERED LONG
ENOUGH.

869
00:39:41,455 --> 00:39:45,418
SORRY, CHE, BUT TIME'S UP.

870
00:39:48,815 --> 00:39:51,293
>> I KNEW IT WAS GOING TO COME
OUT OF YOU SOME DAY.

871
00:39:51,293 --> 00:39:55,462
TODAY WAS THE 150th RUNNING OF
THE KENTUCKY DERBY, 

872
00:39:55,462 --> 00:39:58,906
ALSO KNOWN
TO HORSES AS SQUID GAME.

>> SOUTH DAKOTA GOVERNOR AND

874
00:40:03,409 --> 00:40:07,044
TRUMP'S POTENTIAL V.P. CANDIDATE

875
00:40:07,046 --> 00:40:08,146
KRISTI NOEM IS BEING CRITICIZED

876
00:40:08,148 --> 00:40:11,616
FOR WRITING IN HER MEMOIR ABOUT

877
00:40:11,618 --> 00:40:17,455
SHOOTING HER 14-MONTH-OLD PUPPY

878
00:40:17,457 --> 00:40:17,788
CRICKET.

879
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:19,624
HERE TO TALK ABOUT IT IS HER

880
00:40:19,626 --> 00:40:20,024
OTHER DOG.

881
00:40:20,026 --> 00:40:21,025
>> NICE TO BE HERE.

882
00:40:21,027 --> 00:40:21,359
CRICKET.

883
00:40:21,361 --> 00:40:22,760
CAN YOU SHAKE?

884
00:40:22,762 --> 00:40:23,728
DO YOU DO PAW?

885
00:40:23,730 --> 00:40:24,428
>> SURE.

886
00:40:24,430 --> 00:40:25,863
IT'S GREAT TO SEE YOU.

887
00:40:25,865 --> 00:40:27,665
SO YOUR NAME IS ALSO CRICKET?

888
00:40:27,667 --> 00:40:31,302
>> MY NAME IS ACTUALLY CRICKET

889
00:40:31,304 --> 00:40:31,602
VII.

890
00:40:31,604 --> 00:40:32,069
>> THE SEVENTH?

891
00:40:32,071 --> 00:40:34,338
>> YEAH, THE FIRST SIX WERE BAD

892
00:40:34,340 --> 00:40:35,006
DOGS, COLIN.

893
00:40:35,008 --> 00:40:36,807
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY,

894
00:40:36,809 --> 00:40:37,942
LUCKY NUMBER SEVEN, RIGHT?

895
00:40:37,944 --> 00:40:38,543
>> SURE.

896
00:40:38,545 --> 00:40:40,545
YOU'RE HERE TO DEFEND KRISTI

897
00:40:40,547 --> 00:40:40,845
NOEM?

898
00:40:40,847 --> 00:40:41,412
>> OF COURSE.

899
00:40:41,414 --> 00:40:43,181
SHE'S A GREAT OWNER.

900
00:40:43,183 --> 00:40:44,615
HE'S A GREAT DOG OWNER.

901
00:40:44,617 --> 00:40:47,885
ALL THIS STUFF ABOUT KILLING

902
00:40:47,887 --> 00:40:48,586
ANIMALS IS JUST MEDIA SPIN.

903
00:40:48,588 --> 00:40:50,521
>> BUT SHE WROTE ABOUT IT IN HER

I'M A DOG.

907
00:40:52,325 --> 00:40:53,024
>> RIGHT.

908
00:40:53,026 --> 00:40:55,993
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT MEDIA SPIN IS?

909
00:40:55,995 --> 00:40:58,763
>> LOOK, THE DOG WAS THE

910
00:40:58,765 --> 00:40:59,096
PROBLEM.

911
00:40:59,098 --> 00:41:00,298
BARKING, EATING EVERY DAY.

912
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:01,265
WHO DOES THAT?

913
00:41:01,267 --> 00:41:03,901
IF SHE DIDN'T KILL HIM, I WOULD.

914
00:41:03,903 --> 00:41:05,736

PLEASE, I LOVE YOU, KRISTI.

919
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:14,979
>> ALL RIGHT.

920
00:41:14,981 --> 00:41:18,583
JUST SEEMS UNDERNEATH IT LIKE

921
00:41:18,585 --> 00:41:20,685
YOU'RE A LITTLE SCARED.

922
00:41:20,687 --> 00:41:21,452
>> SCARED?

923
00:41:21,454 --> 00:41:22,486
I'M NOT SCARED.

924
00:41:22,488 --> 00:41:24,288
I HAVE A GREAT LIFE.

925
00:41:24,290 --> 00:41:26,324
SHE GIVES ME SO MANY TOYS.

926
00:41:26,326 --> 00:41:30,261
SHE EVEN GAVE ME A DOG BUTTON

927
00:41:30,263 --> 00:41:30,528
MAP.

928
00:41:30,530 --> 00:41:33,864
YOU CAN SAY RUN OR HUNGRY.

929
00:41:33,866 --> 00:41:34,832
CHECK IT OUT.

930
00:41:34,834 --> 00:41:37,702
SHE, IS, GOING, TO, KILL, ME.

931
00:41:37,704 --> 00:41:38,669
>> CRICKET.

932
00:41:38,671 --> 00:41:39,370
>> WHAT?

933
00:41:39,372 --> 00:41:41,272
THESE ARE LIKE BROKEN OR

934
00:41:41,274 --> 00:41:41,639
SOMETHING.

935
00:41:41,641 --> 00:41:44,976
THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEANT TO SAY.

936
00:41:44,978 --> 00:41:46,377
I, DIE, TONIGHT.

937
00:41:46,379 --> 00:41:48,112
>> OH, MY GOD.

938

LISTEN, BUDDY, IT'S GONNA BE

939
00:41:48,815 --> 00:41:52,149
OKAY.

940
00:41:52,151 --> 00:41:54,285
>> DON'T MAKE ANY SUDDEN

941
00:41:54,287 --> 00:41:54,785
MOVEMENTS, MAN.

942
00:41:54,787 --> 00:41:55,620
>> I'M SORRY, MAN.

943
00:41:55,622 --> 00:41:56,487
>> IT'S COOL.

944
00:41:56,489 --> 00:41:57,421
IT'S COOL.

945
00:41:57,423 --> 00:41:58,990
MY POINT IS THAT SHE'S THE BEST.

946
00:41:58,992 --> 00:42:01,225
IT'S LIKE THEY SAY, I DON'T KNOW

947
00:42:01,227 --> 00:42:02,493
IF SHE RESCUED ME OR IF I'M

948
00:42:02,495 --> 00:42:05,263
GOING TO GET SHOT IN THE FACE.

949
00:42:05,265 --> 00:42:08,165
>> THAT'S NOT WHAT THEY SAY.

950
00:42:08,167 --> 00:42:10,101
CRICKET, YOU KNOW KRISTI WELL.

951
00:42:10,103 --> 00:42:11,469
WHY DO YOU THINK SHE WROTE THESE

952
00:42:11,471 --> 00:42:12,737
STORIES IN HER BOOK?

953
00:42:12,739 --> 00:42:17,475
>> I TOLD YOU, COLIN, I CAN'T

954
00:42:17,477 --> 00:42:17,975
READ.

955
00:42:17,977 --> 00:42:22,179
SHE, THOUGHT, TRUMP, WOULD,

956
00:42:22,181 --> 00:42:22,847
LIKE, IT.

957
00:42:22,849 --> 00:42:24,448
>> SO SHE WROTE THE BOOK TO SEEM

958
00:42:24,450 --> 00:42:25,116
TOUGH FOR TRUMP?

959
00:42:25,118 --> 00:42:25,816
>> I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHO THAT

960
00:42:25,818 --> 00:42:29,520
IS.

961
00:42:29,522 --> 00:42:33,991
BUT, SHE'S, NOT, INVITED, TO,

962
00:42:34,527 --> 00:42:36,560
MAR-A-LAGO.

963
00:42:36,562 --> 00:42:37,895
>> ONE OF THE DOG BUTTONS IS

964
00:42:37,897 --> 00:42:42,400
MAR-A-LAGO?

965
00:42:42,402 --> 00:42:45,369
>> HEY, HEY, YOU KNOW SHE'S

966
00:42:45,371 --> 00:42:45,970
WRITING ANOTHER BOOK.

967
00:42:45,972 --> 00:42:48,072
SHE KEEPS SAYING, YOU BETTER

968
00:42:48,074 --> 00:42:50,341
BEHAVE OR YOU'RE GOING TO GO IN

969
00:42:50,343 --> 00:42:50,708
THE BOOK.

970
00:42:50,710 --> 00:42:51,676
>> OH, MY GOD.

971
00:42:51,678 --> 00:42:54,679
SO SHE JUST KILLS ALL HER

972
00:42:54,681 --> 00:42:55,012
ANIMALS?

973

I'M TALKING TO YOU, RYAN
GOSLING.

1129
00:50:38,220 --> 00:50:42,909
WHEN I STARTED DOING PRESS, I WAS LIKE YOU,

00:50:42,909 --> 00:50:44,526
 FUNNY, GOOD LOOKING,

1133
00:50:51,314 --> 00:50:54,914
BUT YOU CAN GET CLEAN.

1142
00:51:14,293 --> 00:51:16,880
LOST HIM

I LOVE YOUR SHOW.
ARE YOU KIDDING, ALL THE TIME.

00:51:20,662 --> 00:51:24,736
UNFROSTED IS A DELIGHTFUL CRAZY TALE 

1145
00:51:24,736 --> 00:51:28,158
WITH SOME FUNNY PEOPLE AS
YOU'VE NEVER SEEN THEM BEFORE.

1146
00:51:28,158 --> 00:51:31,815

PRESS, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.

1147
00:51:32,912 --> 00:51:35,400

THE DOCTOR WILL BE WITH YOU

1151
00:52:14,198 --> 00:52:14,563
SHORTLY.

1152
00:52:14,565 --> 00:52:15,030

1157
00:52:21,939 --> 00:52:24,139
>> I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY

1158
00:52:24,141 --> 00:52:25,975
DR. MORGAN WOULD CHOOSE NOW OF

1159
00:52:25,977 --> 00:52:28,444
ALL TIMES TO GO ON VACATION.

1161
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:31,413
YOU HAVE NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT.

1162
00:52:31,415 --> 00:52:34,283
FAT DADDY IS A MORE THAN CAPABLE

1163
00:52:34,285 --> 00:52:34,617
OBGYN.

1164

>> I'M SORRY.

1173
00:52:48,733 --> 00:52:50,833
WHAT THE HELL IS THAT ON YOUR

00:52:50,835 --> 00:52:51,300
JACKET?

1175

I WOULDN'T WORRY ABOUT THAT.

1177
00:52:53,905 --> 00:52:54,503
THAT'S JUST SAUCE.

1178
00:52:54,505 --> 00:52:57,206
>> BABE, JUST LET HIM DO HIS

1179
00:52:57,208 --> 00:52:57,506
JOB.

1180
00:52:57,508 --> 00:52:59,608

1181
00:52:59,610 --> 00:52:59,942
PARENTS?

1182
00:52:59,944 --> 00:53:00,743
>> YES.

1183
00:53:00,745 --> 00:53:02,678
AND I'M STARTING TO THINK HE'S

1184
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:04,079
MORE NERVOUS THAN I AM.

1185
00:53:04,081 --> 00:53:05,080
>> I GET IT.

1186
00:53:05,082 --> 00:53:06,248
I'VE BEEN THERE.

1187
00:53:06,250 --> 00:53:08,951
EVERYTHING'S GOING TO BE FINE.

1188
00:53:08,953 --> 00:53:10,052
DR. MORGAN SENT OVER YOUR

1189
00:53:10,054 --> 00:53:10,386

SAYS WE ARE SEVEN MONTHS

1191
00:53:11,722 --> 00:53:12,087

WE'RE GO TO DO A QUICK

1193
00:53:14,558 --> 00:53:15,758
ULTRASOUND, MAKE SURE EVERYTHING

1194

1201
00:53:28,973 --> 00:53:29,405
>> IT'S OKAY.

1202
00:53:29,407 --> 00:53:30,172
BEFORE I BECAME AN OBGYN, I WAS

1203
00:53:30,174 --> 00:53:33,309

DON'T YOU EVEN WORRY ABOUT IT.

00:53:45,389 --> 00:53:48,891
DON'T YOU WORRY ABOUT NOTHING,

00:54:20,691 --> 00:54:22,057
>> FOR REAL?

1233
00:54:22,059 --> 00:54:24,293
I THOUGHT YOU SAID YOU WERE

1234
00:54:24,295 --> 00:54:24,693
PREGNANT.

1235
00:54:24,695 --> 00:54:26,695

00:54:31,569 --> 00:54:32,434
LET'S CALM DOWN.

1241
00:54:32,436 --> 00:54:34,536
YOU SEE THIS IS WHY YOU CAN'T

1242
00:54:34,538 --> 00:54:36,005
ALWAYS TRUST THESE MACHINES.

1243
00:54:36,007 --> 00:54:38,674
SOMETIMES, JUST LIKE IN

1244

SHOULDN'T YOU BE WEARING GLOVES?

1252
00:54:53,024 --> 00:54:54,790
>> DARRYL, I ASKED YOU TO COME

1253
00:54:54,792 --> 00:54:57,459
HERE FOR SUPPORT AND TO SEE IF

00:54:57,461 --> 00:54:59,094
YOU'RE REALLY READY TO BE A

1255
00:54:59,096 --> 00:54:59,428
FATHER.

1256
00:54:59,430 --> 00:55:01,764

BE A FATHER.

1259
00:55:05,002 --> 00:55:07,403
>> WELL, THEN STOP MAKING THINGS

1260
00:55:07,405 --> 00:55:07,736
WEIRD.

1261
00:55:07,738 --> 00:55:08,937
>> OKAY.

1262
00:55:08,939 --> 00:55:11,540
2-2-5, THAT'S SLOW AND LOW.

1263
00:55:11,542 --> 00:55:14,309
>> I CAN'T FIND -- I FOUND HIM.

1264

1267
00:55:23,821 --> 00:55:27,956
FINGERS?

1268
00:55:27,958 --> 00:55:28,457
>> OH, YOU RIGHT.

1269
00:55:28,459 --> 00:55:29,058
MY BAD.

1270
00:55:29,060 --> 00:55:31,160
THAT'S A BAD HABIT.

1271
00:55:31,162 --> 00:55:33,729
NURSE, HAND ME THE PAPER TOWELS,

1272
00:55:33,731 --> 00:55:34,063
PLEASE.

1273

1281
00:55:46,811 --> 00:55:47,676
TWO MONTHS.

1282
00:55:47,678 --> 00:55:50,446

1283
00:55:50,448 --> 00:55:50,979
BONE THEN.

1284
00:55:50,981 --> 00:55:52,815
>> FALL OFF THE BONE?

1285
00:55:52,817 --> 00:55:54,716

TRACEY?
