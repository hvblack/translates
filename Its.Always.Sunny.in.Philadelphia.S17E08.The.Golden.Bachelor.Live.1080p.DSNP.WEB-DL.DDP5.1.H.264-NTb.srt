1
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:12,095
My name is Frank.

2
00:00:12,721 --> 00:00:17,684
I've had a great life, a family,
lots of friends, adventures,

3
00:00:18,185 --> 00:00:20,144
but I'm ready for a change.

4
00:00:20,145 --> 00:00:22,898
One last shot at finding true love.

5
00:00:24,233 --> 00:00:25,484
I'm hoping this is it.

6
00:00:28,672 --> 00:00:32,290
Golden

7
00:00:34,368 --> 00:00:36,828
Thank you. Hi.

8
00:00:40,666 --> 00:00:42,209
Thank you so much. Thank you.

9
00:00:44,169 --> 00:00:45,878
Thank you and good evening,
Bachelor nation.

10
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:50,968
I'm Jesse Palmer, and welcome to
The Golden Bachelor season finale.

11
00:00:53,095 --> 00:00:56,055
Of course we are coming to you live
from Los Angeles

12
00:00:56,056 --> 00:01:00,142
as Frank's journey to find the love of
his life comes to a dramatic conclusion.

13
00:01:00,143 --> 00:01:03,771
Now admittedly,
the crew nor the producers were prepared

14
00:01:03,772 --> 00:01:08,609
to host a Bachelor as eccentric
as Frank Reynolds.

15
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:11,737
In fact, this is the first season
in Bachelor history

16
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:14,283
where we considered ending
the entire franchise altogether.

17
00:01:14,783 --> 00:01:19,245
But, boy, are we glad we didn't,
because Frank captured our hearts,

18
00:01:19,246 --> 00:01:21,372
and tonight is the moment
we've all been waiting for.

19
00:01:21,373 --> 00:01:23,791
Will Frank find true love again?

20
00:01:23,792 --> 00:01:26,711
All I can say is that you'll have
to see it to believe it.

21
00:01:26,712 --> 00:01:28,546
So let's take a look back
at the season's highlights

22
00:01:28,547 --> 00:01:31,173
where Frank started
in a very different place

23
00:01:31,174 --> 00:01:32,592
than where we find him today.

24
00:01:33,677 --> 00:01:35,303
Let's get this show on the road.

25
00:01:35,304 --> 00:01:41,059
Can't wait to find a Grade A,
prime cut piece of ****.

26
00:01:41,685 --> 00:01:42,685
To love.

27
00:01:42,686 --> 00:01:47,190
Frank, admittedly, was a little rougher
around the edges than we're accustomed to.

28
00:01:51,695 --> 00:01:55,906
All right,
so where are all the broads?

29
00:01:55,907 --> 00:01:57,199
I dropped a couple of blueys.

30
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:02,038
This baby's got about a half hour
to perform like, pew,

31
00:02:02,039 --> 00:02:03,831
and then that's it. So, let's hurry up.

32
00:02:03,832 --> 00:02:07,585
- Okay, the first car is arriving now.
- Okay, all right, good. The first car.

33
00:02:07,586 --> 00:02:09,171
Oh, my God, I'm getting a chubby.

34
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:11,672
Look at this. Mmm, mmm, mmm.

35
00:02:11,673 --> 00:02:14,760
Ooh. Here it comes. I'm anticipating this...

36
00:02:15,636 --> 00:02:17,763
Oh, let's see, yeah.

37
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:23,684
- Uh, nope.
- Excuse me?

38
00:02:23,685 --> 00:02:25,811
- No. No. Nope.
- Frank, Frank.

39
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:27,605
Pass, pass, pass, it's a pass.

40
00:02:27,606 --> 00:02:30,024
You can walk by. You can keep on going.

41
00:02:30,025 --> 00:02:32,109
Just walk on by. That's it.

42
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:35,364
Next, next, next. Bring the next one in.

43
00:02:38,116 --> 00:02:39,408
- Uh-uh.
- Frank.

44
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:41,410
No, no. Absolutely not.

45
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:43,871
No, no. Pass on. Next.
Let's go to the next one.

46
00:02:43,872 --> 00:02:45,790
Next one, this is not working out.
What's going on?

47
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:48,167
Frank, there's a time for this.
It's just not right now.

48
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:50,462
All right, bring the next one on,
bring the next one on.

49
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:55,133
I'm starting to get nervous.
What do we got?

50
00:02:57,636 --> 00:02:59,137
Holy... Oh...

51
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:02,556
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

52
00:03:02,557 --> 00:03:04,975
No, pass, pass, pass.

53
00:03:04,976 --> 00:03:07,144
Are all these whores gonna be this old?

54
00:03:07,145 --> 00:03:10,564
Why did I do this?
I don't know what's the matter with me.

55
00:03:10,565 --> 00:03:12,817
What the **** did I do?

56
00:03:12,818 --> 00:03:16,362
Everyone that got out of the car,
I mean, they were, like, crackling.

57
00:03:16,363 --> 00:03:18,614
I mean, you could hear
their **** crackling.

58
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,243
- It was like, just, old meat.
- Frank,

59
00:03:22,244 --> 00:03:24,120
honestly, you didn't understand
the premise of this show?

60
00:03:24,121 --> 00:03:26,163
Well, I knew there would be
a couple of duds,

61
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:29,959
but I thought you Hollywood people
were all about diversity.

62
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,836
Well, there's gonna be women
of every ethnicity here.

63
00:03:31,837 --> 00:03:34,380
Age. Diversity of age.

64
00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:37,842
Frank, the show's called
The Golden Bachelor.

65
00:03:37,843 --> 00:03:39,635
Golden Bachelor, my ****.

66
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:41,178
I'm **** out of here

67
00:03:41,179 --> 00:03:44,140
unless I find something
coming out of that car that I like.

68
00:03:44,141 --> 00:03:45,684
You gotta do something.

69
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,269
- You ever watch TikTok?
- Yeah, of course.

70
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:50,980
Well, you ever...
you ever hear of Cock Chewa?

71
00:03:50,981 --> 00:03:52,064
- Cock Chewa?
- Cock Chewa...

72
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:54,650
And so in a series
of Golden Bachelor firsts,

73
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:57,361
we caved into Frank's demands.

74
00:03:57,362 --> 00:03:59,947
I saw this trash on TikTok.

75
00:03:59,948 --> 00:04:01,824
Her name was Cock Chewa.

76
00:04:01,825 --> 00:04:06,412
Her catchphrase was, "Chew on that thang."

77
00:04:06,413 --> 00:04:07,663
I had to have her.

78
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:09,999
My heart's beating a mile a minute.

79
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,293
Let's see what happens.

80
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:19,968
What's coming out?

81
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:23,679
Oh! It's her.
That's her. That's her!

82
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,890
Hey, y'all!

83
00:04:25,891 --> 00:04:28,434
- Chew on that thang.
- Chew on that thang!

84
00:04:28,435 --> 00:04:30,728
- Chew on that thang.
- Okay. She's it. She's the one.

85
00:04:30,729 --> 00:04:31,896
- Wait, what? What?
- I picked her.

86
00:04:31,897 --> 00:04:33,647
- Yeah, she's it. Okay, that's it.
- Wait, what?

87
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:35,649
- I choose her. Yes.
- I get paid for this, right?

88
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:37,735
Yeah, the game's over. We can take her.

89
00:04:37,736 --> 00:04:40,279
No, no, no, Frank.
It's only the first episode, okay?

90
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:43,449
We have to go through this whole process,
otherwise there can't be a show.

91
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:46,660
- All right, well, you get paid.
- Yeah.

92
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:47,745
It's the first night,

93
00:04:47,746 --> 00:04:50,039
so you're gonna have
to wait a little while

94
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,750
- to chew on that thang.
- Chew on that thang.

95
00:04:52,751 --> 00:04:54,794
- Chew on that thang.
- Okay, let's just keep it moving here.

96
00:04:54,795 --> 00:04:57,881
Oh, baby, am I boned up.
Okay, here let's go.

97
00:04:58,548 --> 00:05:00,258
Okay. Okay.

98
00:05:00,801 --> 00:05:01,842
All right.

99
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:05,096
Oops, I thought you said
we were done with the old ones.

100
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:10,601
Uh, hi. Very nice to see you,
you know. But no.

101
00:05:10,602 --> 00:05:13,270
- But no. Okay, so anyway, pass.
- Oh.

102
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:17,775
But, you know, go on inside and keep warm.
I'll get you out of here ASAP.

103
00:05:17,776 --> 00:05:21,278
You're kidding me.
This cretin is the bachelor?

104
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:23,447
I got better looking boils.

105
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:27,660
That was a good one.
You got me there. You got me there.

106
00:05:27,661 --> 00:05:30,247
Well, maybe I'll keep this one around
just to entertain me.

107
00:05:30,789 --> 00:05:32,957
She got me with that... That was very...

108
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:35,459
She's good.
Let's lump her in with the other one.

109
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:39,005
We'll see how it goes.
That was funny. She was pretty funny.

110
00:05:39,631 --> 00:05:43,467
Oh. Oh. What's this?
I thought I said no dudes.

111
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:46,011
Oh, I have an Amazon Prime delivery
for a, uh, Frank Reynolds.

112
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:47,388
Oh, Frank Reynolds, that's me.

113
00:05:47,389 --> 00:05:50,057
Yeah, that's me.
Oh, yeah, this... Thank you.

114
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:52,768
Oh, my, my, that was so fast.

115
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:55,813
Amazon Prime deliveries are so fast.

116
00:05:55,814 --> 00:05:57,773
Frank, what are you doing?
You can't bring your own plugs.

117
00:05:57,774 --> 00:06:00,901
Yeah... I... No, we... No plugs.
Their items are very meaningful to me.

118
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:05,739
I am fired up about Chewy.
That's a broad I could spend my life with.

119
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:08,909
And the other one's good too.
They both got mouths on 'em.

120
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:11,495
One's an on-ramp, one's an off-ramp.

121
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:13,498
I'm leaning toward the 20-year-old.

122
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:15,708
Since Frank had already chosen
his final two,

123
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:19,337
we had to get creative
with the situations we put them in.

124
00:06:20,422 --> 00:06:22,131
So, uh, where you from?

125
00:06:22,132 --> 00:06:23,550
Gang, gang.

126
00:06:24,134 --> 00:06:26,218
Chew, chew.

127
00:06:30,265 --> 00:06:32,892
That's a butthole.

128
00:06:32,893 --> 00:06:34,602
Thank you, y'all. Thank you.

129
00:06:34,603 --> 00:06:36,520
What's that?
What are you doing?

130
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:38,230
I'm making money on a live stream.

131
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:40,316
- Huh?
- Gang, gang.

132
00:06:40,317 --> 00:06:41,734
You're making...

133
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:49,158
- Well, what kind of music do you like?
- Thank you.

134
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:52,328
The conversation
was a little rough.

135
00:06:52,329 --> 00:06:55,039
I didn't know what the hell
she was doing with the phone.

136
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:58,208
I guess people pay her
to respond to emojis?

137
00:06:58,209 --> 00:07:00,085
I was losing my patience.

138
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:06,843
Look, if we don't bang soon,
I'm gonna boot you off the show.

139
00:07:09,346 --> 00:07:11,013
Well, that worked like a charm.

140
00:07:11,014 --> 00:07:12,848
We banged three times that night.

141
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:16,435
And on some kind of
OnlyFans live stream thing.

142
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:19,063
Made 12 grand. It was incredible.

143
00:07:19,064 --> 00:07:21,690
Except for the chewing.

144
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:23,109
That was weird as hell.

145
00:07:23,735 --> 00:07:28,782
I-I thought it was more of a catch phrase
than an actual method.

146
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:36,789
Where the **** is he?

147
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:38,207
Wow. I'm sorry I'm late.

148
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:40,793
I had to dump out big time.

149
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:43,295
Oh, well, that makes two of us.

150
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:45,005
Just got here myself.

151
00:07:45,006 --> 00:07:48,842
Took the liberty of ordering us
the seafood linguine.

152
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:53,514
- Oh. Strong choice. I like that.
- Uh-huh.

153
00:07:57,227 --> 00:07:59,938
So... Hmm. Mm-mmm.

154
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:02,816
What now?

155
00:08:04,359 --> 00:08:06,778
Ah. Well...

156
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:11,573
we could get the linguine to go,
go back to your place.

157
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:15,577
I would say we bang at my place,
but I don't want you hanging around after.

158
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:18,789
- You get it.
- What makes you think I'm gonna bang you?

159
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:21,625
All right,
we bang after dinner.

160
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:24,002
- Eh, make love.
- Hmm.

161
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:26,923
Yeah. So what's your deal?
Were you ever married?

162
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:28,967
If you must know.

163
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:32,178
My husband's dead.

164
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:34,179
You knock him off?

165
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:38,434
They say he got chomped in two
by a great white

166
00:08:38,435 --> 00:08:41,186
while he was snorkeling off
the coast of Maine.

167
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:42,938
Ooh, wicked.

168
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:46,942
Personally, I think he was
smuggling drugs down from Canada,

169
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:50,071
got chainsawed by some cartel.

170
00:08:51,322 --> 00:08:52,949
They only found the bottom half.

171
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:55,909
Nasty.

172
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:58,412
Mmm. Nasty business.

173
00:08:58,413 --> 00:09:00,040
Did you keep the dong?

174
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:04,377
Of course I did.

175
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:08,798
I had it pickled and put in a jar.

176
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:15,262
That's what I would have wanted.

177
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:18,391
- Hmm.
- Wow. Beautiful.

178
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:23,979
I have to say
I enjoyed the conversation.

179
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:26,440
We talked all night, didn't even bang.

180
00:09:26,441 --> 00:09:29,527
Which is probably better
because my cock was chewed to ****.

181
00:09:30,153 --> 00:09:33,113
So Frank was left with a dilemma.
Who was he gonna choose?

182
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:35,324
And for that he turned to his family.

183
00:09:35,325 --> 00:09:37,326
But in a bizarre turn of events,

184
00:09:37,327 --> 00:09:41,664
the producers learned that his family
was not his family at all.

185
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:45,542
He had hired actors to play them.

186
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:48,253
These people are maniacs.
You don't understand.

187
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:51,173
I was afraid they were gonna embarrass me
on national television.

188
00:09:51,174 --> 00:09:55,719
So Frank was concerned
that his real family would embarrass him.

189
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,180
It was time to go to his hometown:

190
00:09:57,847 --> 00:10:01,016
Philadelphia.
The birthplace of our nation.

191
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:03,060
Could it be the birthplace of a new love?

192
00:10:03,061 --> 00:10:05,938
Things were off to a rocky start.

193
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:10,359
I was terrified to have Sam
and Chewy meet the gang.

194
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:12,654
But I have to admit,
they played it really cool.

195
00:10:13,905 --> 00:10:15,156
Well, here we are.

196
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:19,660
- I'm so excited to see Frank.
- Oh, I'm just excited to meet the ladies.

197
00:10:19,661 --> 00:10:21,371
If Frank likes them, I'll like them.

198
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:25,457
Wonder where they are.

199
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,127
I, too, am feeling things.

200
00:10:29,254 --> 00:10:32,256
Well, speak of the dev...
Uh, speak of Frank.

201
00:10:34,259 --> 00:10:36,176
- Hello.
- Hi. Hi.

202
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:39,847
- Well, here we are.
- Uh-huh.

203
00:10:41,099 --> 00:10:43,058
I was really nervous
that you guys were gonna be mad

204
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:44,601
about the whole fake family thing.

205
00:10:46,271 --> 00:10:49,314
- Frank, forget it, huh?
- Oh, no. Please, we get it.

206
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:50,691
- I don't care.
- You were nervous.

207
00:10:50,692 --> 00:10:51,859
- Yeah.
- I'm passed that.

208
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:55,904
Yeah, I want you to know how happy we are
for both of you and for Frank.

209
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:57,823
- Well, thank you.
- We just want what's best for everyone.

210
00:10:57,824 --> 00:10:58,907
- That's right.
- Yeah, yeah.

211
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:01,743
Uh, Frank, should we take your dates
and get to know them a little better?

212
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:07,416
Okay. Uh, all right. Play nice.

213
00:11:07,417 --> 00:11:08,500
Play nice.

214
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:11,128
- Well, we always play nice.
- He's a funny guy, right?

215
00:11:11,129 --> 00:11:12,713
- He's so funny.
- A joker.

216
00:11:12,714 --> 00:11:16,091
Okay, listen, bitch.
You are not getting the money.

217
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:17,384
Yeah, you're too old to have a baby.

218
00:11:17,385 --> 00:11:19,511
And if you try and adopt, so help me God,

219
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:21,680
we will snuff that thing out
like a cigarillo.

220
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:23,974
- Hmm.
- You're on television.

221
00:11:23,975 --> 00:11:26,101
Please.

222
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:27,936
I think we all know
Disney's never gonna air this.

223
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:29,855
No, but you will have heard it.

224
00:11:29,856 --> 00:11:31,566
So listen to me and listen good.

225
00:11:32,275 --> 00:11:35,778
You are not getting our money.

226
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:39,032
I have my own money.

227
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:41,701
You do?

228
00:11:42,785 --> 00:11:43,786
Explain yourself.

229
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:48,373
I got chicken money and plenty of it too.

230
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:51,418
So whatever Frank's got,
he can just keep it.

231
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:54,087
I made my own fortune
on the backs of others.

232
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:57,717
I don't need to be pulling it out
of an old man's pocket.

233
00:11:58,509 --> 00:12:00,428
- Chicken money.
- Chicken money, huh?

234
00:12:01,596 --> 00:12:03,597
The chicken money comment
was a bit of a relief, you know?

235
00:12:03,598 --> 00:12:05,474
- Not that I trust her.
- Well, no, that's true.

236
00:12:05,475 --> 00:12:07,059
We're not really
the trusting kind, you know?

237
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:09,478
But if she does have this so-called
"chicken money",

238
00:12:09,479 --> 00:12:11,146
then we wouldn't mind, uh...

239
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:13,316
Wetting our beaks.

240
00:12:15,318 --> 00:12:17,236
Did you see that? I didn't have to say it.

241
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:18,529
She-She walked right into it.

242
00:12:20,657 --> 00:12:21,658
Dee's a bird.

243
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:31,959
Uh... ...Chewy.
May I call you Chewy?

244
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:34,044
- Yeah.
- Chewy, we are a vibe.

245
00:12:34,045 --> 00:12:35,671
And we need to know
how you're gonna fit in.

246
00:12:35,672 --> 00:12:38,507
You know, I think it's important
that whoever we bring into the fold

247
00:12:38,508 --> 00:12:39,591
fits with our dynamic.

248
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:42,387
Oh, I love the gays.
I'll chew on that thang.

249
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:45,347
That doesn't make any sense.
Moreover, it sickens me.

250
00:12:45,348 --> 00:12:47,140
What is this?
How is this gonna work?

251
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:49,142
Like, there's no room
for you on my couch, man.

252
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:51,645
- There's just not.
- Okay. Well, we have to pick one, Charlie.

253
00:12:51,646 --> 00:12:54,982
I don't want to pick one.
I don't understand why Frank did this.

254
00:12:54,983 --> 00:12:56,734
If he was unhappy,
why didn't he come to me?

255
00:12:57,443 --> 00:13:00,362
You ruined this, okay? I need it
to go back to the way that it was.

256
00:13:00,363 --> 00:13:01,947
Well, he's not gonna
just chew on that thang.

257
00:13:01,948 --> 00:13:03,949
- Whatever y'all want.
- What does that mean?

258
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:05,325
Why does she keep saying it?

259
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:07,452
I'd seen all I needed to see.

260
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:09,246
I mean, we-we couldn't run the risk of
one of these women

261
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:11,540
becoming a major player
in our lives.

262
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:13,542
We need to bring in
someone Frank might go for,

263
00:13:13,543 --> 00:13:15,919
but who we know we can control.

264
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:20,674
A woman with no personal ambitions
but who Frank could also bang.

265
00:13:20,675 --> 00:13:22,634
Guys, I believe I have the first line.

266
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:24,845
- Uh, announcement.
- Announce. Just an announcement.

267
00:13:24,846 --> 00:13:26,305
- It's just a natural conversation.
- Yes.

268
00:13:26,306 --> 00:13:29,057
- He just has to talk first.
- Welcome to Mac and Dennis's apartment.

269
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:30,934
- Well, you're Mac.
- I'm Mac.

270
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:32,144
- Well, he's just welcoming.
- Yeah.

271
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:33,979
This is Dennis, and this is our apartment.

272
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:36,064
- Yes.
- And we do a lot of hosting.

273
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:38,317
- That's right.
- And we are not a couple.

274
00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:42,237
- No.
- But our living arrangement is

275
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:43,989
- perfectly age appropriate.
- But he is gay.

276
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:45,574
- Well, he is gay.
- Well... ...Goddamn it.

277
00:13:45,575 --> 00:13:47,159
And I am gay.

278
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:50,037
Uh, I believe I may have snapped at Dennis
and hit him a little bit...

279
00:13:50,038 --> 00:13:51,747
- Yeah, a little bit too hard.
- ...too hard.

280
00:13:51,748 --> 00:13:54,082
And also the fact that you're gay
is inconsequential because...

281
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:55,417
- It's playful.
- Yes.

282
00:13:55,418 --> 00:13:57,711
...that's gonna make it sound like
maybe I'm not.

283
00:13:57,712 --> 00:14:00,298
- Chew on that thang.
- What?

284
00:14:01,299 --> 00:14:04,718
- She's not supposed to say that, right?
- Is that it? That's all she can say?

285
00:14:04,719 --> 00:14:06,303
- The vocab is limited.
- Good.

286
00:14:06,304 --> 00:14:07,805
- Yeah.
- I'ma barf on it.

287
00:14:08,556 --> 00:14:09,766
- What?
- What?

288
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:11,266
That's not your line.

289
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:13,060
- What are you... What are you doing?
- What is she...

290
00:14:13,061 --> 00:14:15,270
Ah. It's kind of a catchphrase that I do,
you know what I mean?

291
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:18,149
- She's kidding. You're kidding.
- Barf on that thing, y'all.

292
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:20,150
- That's playful.
- Oh, no.

293
00:14:20,151 --> 00:14:21,777
Well, no, no, no.

294
00:14:21,778 --> 00:14:23,737
Should I have a catchphrase?
I don't approve of this union.

295
00:14:23,738 --> 00:14:25,322
Let's keep this evening about Frank, okay?

296
00:14:25,323 --> 00:14:27,991
And not have... We don't have...
Nobody has any catchphrases.

297
00:14:27,992 --> 00:14:31,411
We-we're just...
Uh, I'm gonna raise a toast... Um...

298
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:35,499
to these two wonderful women
and to an impossible choice.

299
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:36,750
- Yeah.
- Oh.

300
00:14:36,751 --> 00:14:38,335
Oh.

301
00:14:38,336 --> 00:14:40,755
- My, my. Who could that be?
- Oh. What's this?

302
00:14:42,173 --> 00:14:43,174
Goddamn it.

303
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:50,097
Hey... Oh, Miss... Ms. Kelly.

304
00:14:50,098 --> 00:14:53,100
- Mom.
- My God. Well, what brings you here?

305
00:14:53,101 --> 00:14:57,187
To be a slut and to marry Frank.

306
00:14:57,188 --> 00:14:58,355
That was...

307
00:14:58,356 --> 00:15:00,191
Oh.

308
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:03,652
Really? Oh, good.
Dennis, did you put her up to this?

309
00:15:03,653 --> 00:15:05,153
What do you mean? She just came over.

310
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:07,572
Already I have to deal
with two sluts and now a third?

311
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:09,825
Start over, Mac! Start over.

312
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:19,627
? yeah!

313
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:33,682
Now the stakes were even higher
with a third woman in the mix,

314
00:15:33,683 --> 00:15:35,058
but luckily for Frank,

315
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:38,186
he'd have the fantasy suites
to help him make up his mind.

316
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:41,815
This was the hardest decision of my life.
What's the order?

317
00:15:41,816 --> 00:15:46,570
Do I go Chewy first and work my way
to Bonnie through Sam?

318
00:15:46,571 --> 00:15:50,490
Or do I run the risk of being gnawed
to a stump and have to heal?

319
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:52,493
I was feeling so many things.

320
00:15:52,994 --> 00:15:55,412
And then, I had an idea.

321
00:15:55,413 --> 00:15:58,832
Frank, there is no way
Disney is ever gonna go with that.

322
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:00,041
It's what I want.

323
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:01,960
No, Frank, we have to stagger them.

324
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:04,629
I'll handle that
once we're in the middle of it.

325
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:05,922
Look, you wanna join us?

326
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:09,384
I don't love it,
but no eye contact and we're good.

327
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:11,136
All right. Let's go ahead. Let's go.

328
00:16:11,137 --> 00:16:13,639
Ha! Let's go, ladies.

329
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:17,267
We're gonna do kind of a group situation.

330
00:16:17,268 --> 00:16:20,270
Why don't you just come this way?

331
00:16:20,271 --> 00:16:22,147
- There you go. There you go.
- Yeah.

332
00:16:22,148 --> 00:16:24,399
- O-Okay, listen to me, Frank.
- Hey.

333
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,775
I'm no prude, right?

334
00:16:25,776 --> 00:16:28,153
I mean, I was in the navy, right?

335
00:16:28,154 --> 00:16:31,364
I took a whole destroyer
full of torpedoes, you know?

336
00:16:31,365 --> 00:16:33,241
That's pretty funny, Sam.

337
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:34,910
Yeah, but here's the thing:

338
00:16:34,911 --> 00:16:38,330
I feel like I'm ready to settle down
and, you know...

339
00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:43,126
- ...I got feelings for-for-for you, Frank.
- You do?

340
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:45,712
Yeah, you know. Ain't that something.

341
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:47,923
I-I gotta tell you a little story, right?

342
00:16:47,924 --> 00:16:50,258
Well, I'm kind of on the clock here,
you know?

343
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:51,469
Yeah, okay.

344
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:54,137
When I was a little girl,

345
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:57,807
I shortened my name to Sam
and I told everybody,

346
00:16:57,808 --> 00:17:00,019
"Ooh, I-I really liked that
so much better,"

347
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:02,355
but I didn't.

348
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:09,278
I-I just thought that... Samantha,
that's-that's too long for anybody to say.

349
00:17:09,946 --> 00:17:14,491
So-So I changed my name, Frank,
because I thought

350
00:17:14,492 --> 00:17:18,745
that nobody would care enough
to take the time to say the whole thing.

351
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:22,124
Oh, my God. Stupid, huh?

352
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:27,838
- Well, you were a kid.
- I lived my whole life that way.

353
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:33,177
And when I was busy pretending
to be somebody that I wasn't,

354
00:17:34,929 --> 00:17:40,434
you were living your life
being exactly who you are.

355
00:17:44,772 --> 00:17:46,983
I just love that about you, Frank.

356
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:53,072
And I kind of thought
it was too late for me, but then,

357
00:17:54,532 --> 00:17:58,703
you've shown me that it's never too late

358
00:17:59,704 --> 00:18:00,997
to find your heart.

359
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:03,541
And your voice.

360
00:18:04,292 --> 00:18:05,376
And your name.

361
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:12,133
I think I'm falling in love
with you, Frank.

362
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:15,386
Yeah, I-I don't want to ruin that.

363
00:18:16,137 --> 00:18:18,681
So, you know, I'm not going in there.

364
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:21,058
I'm-I'm gonna go.

365
00:18:30,651 --> 00:18:32,819
Sam had struck a chord.

366
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:35,739
And now Frank had an even
tougher decision to make.

367
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:37,866
Just what was he going to do?

368
00:18:37,867 --> 00:18:40,285
Yeah, I mean,
I took a shot, right?

369
00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:44,497
And I-I think he's feeling
the same things I am.

370
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:46,959
At least, I hope so, right?

371
00:18:47,835 --> 00:18:48,836
Yeah.

372
00:18:54,759 --> 00:18:55,760
What's it say?

373
00:19:04,602 --> 00:19:07,437
Look, as much as Dennis
wanted Frank to pick Bonnie,

374
00:19:07,438 --> 00:19:10,149
we all knew he was gonna go
with the 20-year-old, so...

375
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:13,069
I devised that prank
to make sure she was cool.

376
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:16,237
The prank is this,
when they fly us out there, we set off

377
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:19,616
one of those elephant toothpaste bombs
in the mansion.

378
00:19:19,617 --> 00:19:21,368
And then, if she likes it, she's in.

379
00:19:21,369 --> 00:19:22,786
- What the hell is that?
- What is that?

380
00:19:22,787 --> 00:19:24,747
Oh. It's-It's like a chemical reaction.
Check it out.

381
00:19:28,334 --> 00:19:29,709
- Cool, huh?
- Oh. Yeah.

382
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:32,212
This is a good idea though, Mac.
I could work with this.

383
00:19:32,213 --> 00:19:33,797
- Yeah, that's gonna be fun.
- Okay.

384
00:19:33,798 --> 00:19:37,593
So Frank was concerned
that his real family would embarrass him.

385
00:19:38,094 --> 00:19:40,221
Well, we've got them here with us tonight.

386
00:19:40,763 --> 00:19:42,056
How do you guys feel about that?

387
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:45,809
Well...

388
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:51,981
The situation... [strains, gasps] ...under
the circumstances is quite understandable.

389
00:19:51,982 --> 00:19:57,779
Our appearance may seem gruesome,
but all can be quite easily explained.

390
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:58,988
Oh. Indeed.

391
00:19:58,989 --> 00:20:00,407
- Yeah.
- Indeed.

392
00:20:00,408 --> 00:20:04,536
As you can tell,
our voices have also been affected,

393
00:20:04,537 --> 00:20:07,706
creating an unintentionally sinister tone.

394
00:20:07,707 --> 00:20:10,500
- So, where did things go wrong, guys?
- Well...

395
00:20:10,501 --> 00:20:12,419
There seems
to have been a miscalculation.

396
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:15,005
- Our hubris got the best of us.
- Nonsense.

397
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:20,927
There was no mix-up in the laboratory,
no... ...neglect of the pH balance.

398
00:20:20,928 --> 00:20:23,304
It was my jealousy of these women

399
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:26,850
that drove me
to surreptitiously add 20 gallons

400
00:20:26,851 --> 00:20:30,896
of Nair hair removal into the concoction.

401
00:20:31,522 --> 00:20:32,523
Wait, wait, you did what?

402
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:38,528
You wear short shorts
If you dare wear short shorts, Nair for--

403
00:20:38,529 --> 00:20:40,029
Yeah, we know the product.

404
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:41,239
You're familiar with it?

405
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,699
Do you guys know the song?

406
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:44,659
- Yes, we know the goddamn song.
- Yes.

407
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:45,952
Uh. Okay, okay, okay, that's just...

408
00:20:45,953 --> 00:20:47,912
We're gonna stop right there.

409
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:50,331
Uh. So with no help
from his family whatsoever,

410
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:53,585
Frank is now left with the most
important choice of his entire life.

411
00:20:53,586 --> 00:20:57,673
And on that final night he had
to make that choice alone.

412
00:21:00,384 --> 00:21:01,385
Ooh.

413
00:21:03,429 --> 00:21:05,054
Frank, it's the final rose.

414
00:21:05,055 --> 00:21:08,016
This is it. So who will you choose?

415
00:21:08,017 --> 00:21:10,102
Will it be Bonnie or Sara?

416
00:21:11,771 --> 00:21:12,938
Who the hell is Sara?

417
00:21:13,564 --> 00:21:16,357
You actually thought that the woman's
birth name was Cock Chewa?

418
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:19,110
Oh. Never gave it much thought.

419
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:20,654
America is waiting.

420
00:21:21,405 --> 00:21:24,116
Frank, who are you gonna give it to?

421
00:21:26,869 --> 00:21:32,124
Well, Bonnie, you are a dirty, dirty slut.

422
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:34,334
Thank you, Frank.

423
00:21:34,335 --> 00:21:35,503
And you're old as hell.

424
00:21:36,045 --> 00:21:41,050
But-But I gotta be honest,
you bone me up like nobody else.

425
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:44,136
So it's really hard not to choose you.

426
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:51,559
Chewy, I gotta be honest,
I don't like the teeth.

427
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:56,314
I-I never understood the chewing thing.
I mean, people like that?

428
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:57,774
Chew on that thang?

429
00:21:57,775 --> 00:22:01,110
It's weird as hell.
It hurts, your chomping on it.

430
00:22:01,111 --> 00:22:04,030
I mean, it's like...

431
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:06,950
You go deep, deep, deep.
The bottom? Oh.

432
00:22:06,951 --> 00:22:09,537
I may never recover from that.

433
00:22:10,704 --> 00:22:11,789
But I gotta say,

434
00:22:13,123 --> 00:22:17,210
you are so goddamn hot.

435
00:22:17,211 --> 00:22:19,463
It is hard not to choose you.

436
00:22:20,673 --> 00:22:22,049
I gotta make a decision.

437
00:22:26,804 --> 00:22:28,055
I gotta make a decision.

438
00:22:31,517 --> 00:22:32,518
And...

439
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:35,229
my decision is...

440
00:22:42,069 --> 00:22:43,070
Sam!

441
00:22:44,113 --> 00:22:46,448
Sam! Sam, where are you?

442
00:22:48,284 --> 00:22:49,285
Sam!

443
00:22:50,411 --> 00:22:51,412
Sam!

444
00:22:53,581 --> 00:22:54,874
Sam!

445
00:22:57,376 --> 00:23:00,796
Samantha! Samantha!

446
00:23:01,714 --> 00:23:02,715
Frank.

447
00:23:03,465 --> 00:23:05,175
- Frank.
- Saman... Oh.

448
00:23:05,676 --> 00:23:07,552
Samantha, don't get on that bus.

449
00:23:07,553 --> 00:23:09,262
I'm a jerk. I'm an idiot.

450
00:23:09,263 --> 00:23:11,514
But most of all I'm a coward.

451
00:23:11,515 --> 00:23:14,977
I-I didn't let you go
because I didn't like you.

452
00:23:15,728 --> 00:23:18,897
I-I got rid of you
because I like you too much

453
00:23:18,898 --> 00:23:20,983
and it scared the shit out of me.

454
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:23,235
I'm just like you, Samantha.

455
00:23:24,111 --> 00:23:26,447
But together we don't have to be afraid.

456
00:23:28,324 --> 00:23:31,243
Would you accept this rose and be my wife?

457
00:23:37,124 --> 00:23:38,125
Frank,

458
00:23:39,001 --> 00:23:40,002
I will.

459
00:23:57,019 --> 00:23:58,561
Be strong, Bonnie.

460
00:23:58,562 --> 00:24:01,981
Be strong for your little gingerbread man.

461
00:24:01,982 --> 00:24:03,566
Bonnie?

462
00:24:03,567 --> 00:24:04,860
How do you guys know each other?

463
00:24:06,403 --> 00:24:07,654
- This is my date.
- Yeah.

464
00:24:07,655 --> 00:24:10,698
One. Two. Three.

465
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:13,660
- Why are you doing everything in threes?
- So Charlie doesn't die.

466
00:24:13,661 --> 00:24:14,994
Show us on the doll.

467
00:24:14,995 --> 00:24:16,120
Show you what?

468
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:17,705
Where he touched you.

469
00:24:17,706 --> 00:24:19,374
I don't want a dog
to eat my face, Charlie.

470
00:24:19,375 --> 00:24:21,042
She doesn't want a dog eating her face.

471
00:24:21,043 --> 00:24:22,919
Oh. Sorry.

472
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,003
You!

473
00:24:24,004 --> 00:24:26,005
- Hey.
- Merry Christmas.

474
00:24:26,006 --> 00:24:27,840
- I'm so excited. It's almost Christmas!
- I'm so excited!

475
00:24:27,841 --> 00:24:31,887
I'll be in the kitchen making
gingerbread men for my gingerbread boy.
