IT TRULY IS AN HONOR TO BE HERE
HOSTING THE TRUMPS.

7
00:00:24,446 --> 00:00:28,784
AFTER THAT LADY WHOSE NAME I
ALREADY FORGET GAVE ME HER NOBEL
PRIZE,

8
00:00:28,784 --> 00:00:31,181
 I THOUGHT, I NEED MORE
AWARDS.

9
00:00:31,181 --> 00:00:35,197
AND AFTER ALL WHAT OUR LITTLE
FREAKS AND PSYCHOS IN I.C.E. HAVE BEEN DOING,

10
00:00:35,197 --> 00:00:36,715
 I NEED MORE
DISTRACTIONS.

BOTH MY DEAD PURPLE HANDS WILL
EXPLODE WITH BLOOD.

DOCTORS SAY I COULD LIVE TO BE
120, OR CURRENT AGE.

THAT'S WHY I HAD TO GET A SPOT

OVERWHELMING BECAUSE I AM A

163
00:10:35,285 --> 00:10:36,751
REALLY SHY PERSON, BELIEVE IT OR

164
00:10:36,753 --> 00:10:39,054

165
00:10:39,056 --> 00:10:39,421
ATTENTION.

166
00:10:39,423 --> 00:10:40,121
FOR EXAMPLE, HERE'S ME AT MY

167
00:10:40,123 --> 00:10:43,124
16th BIRTHDAY PARTY.

168
00:10:54,104 --> 00:10:55,070
YEAH, YEAH.

169
00:10:55,072 --> 00:10:59,074
YES, I WAS ON MTV'S "MY SUPER

170
00:10:59,076 --> 00:10:59,441
SWEET 16."

171
00:10:59,443 --> 00:11:00,809
I'VE HAD THE CHANCE TO DO SO

172
00:11:00,811 --> 00:11:02,410
MANY THINGS IN MY LIFE.

173
00:11:02,412 --> 00:11:04,879
FROM SINGING TO DANCING TO

174
00:11:04,881 --> 00:11:05,814
ACTING TO DIRECTING.

175
00:11:05,816 --> 00:11:07,982
AND YES, I AM CURRENTLY IN

176
00:11:07,984 --> 00:11:11,886
CULINARY SCHOOL, CHEFFING IT UP,

177
00:11:11,888 --> 00:11:13,288
UP UP.

178
00:11:13,724 --> 00:11:16,358
HELL, I RANDOMLY WON "MAD SING

179

00:11:17,794 --> 00:11:18,193
REAL.

181
00:11:18,628 --> 00:11:22,697
ME, I CONSIDER MYSELF A GLADE

182
00:11:22,699 --> 00:11:23,031
PLUG-IN.

183
00:11:23,033 --> 00:11:24,432
WHY ONLY PLUG ME IN THE BATHROOM

184
00:11:24,434 --> 00:11:26,201
WHEN I CAN MAKE THE WHOLE

185
00:11:26,203 --> 00:11:27,402
BUILDING SMELL GOOD?

186
00:11:27,404 --> 00:11:29,304
ALSO, I AM A MOM.

187
00:11:29,306 --> 00:11:30,505
PEOPLE ASK WHEN I SLEEP.

188
00:11:30,507 --> 00:11:33,007
DON'T WORRY, I GET A FULL EIGHT

189
00:11:33,009 --> 00:11:34,442
HOURS A WEEK.

190
00:11:34,845 --> 00:11:36,411
BOTH MY PREGNANCIES WERE VERY,

191
00:11:36,413 --> 00:11:37,545
VERY PEACEFUL.

192
00:11:37,547 --> 00:11:39,047
I DID ALL THE THINGS I WAS

193
00:11:39,049 --> 00:11:39,848
SUPPOSED TO DO.

194
00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:43,051
I WAS GOING TO YOGA, TAKING

195
00:11:43,053 --> 00:11:45,019
VITAMINS AVOIDING RAW FISH.

196
00:11:45,021 --> 00:11:45,754
I THINK WE HAVE A VIDEO OF ME

197

PREGNANT RIGHT HERE.

198

YES.

199
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,299
SO WHOLESOME, SO CALM.

200
00:11:58,301 --> 00:11:59,801
MAN, I REALLY, REALLY LOVE MY

201
00:11:59,803 --> 00:12:00,702
KIDS SO MUCH.

202

I BRING THEM EVERYWHERE WITH ME.

203
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:04,372
BUT WHEN I WAS GIVING MY SPEECH

204
00:12:04,374 --> 00:12:05,573
AT THE GOLDEN GLOBES, I LOOKED

205
00:12:05,575 --> 00:12:07,308
UP TO SEE MY BABIES, I WANTED TO

206
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:08,743
SEE THEY FACES, YOU KNOW?

207
00:12:08,745 --> 00:12:10,612
JUST TO SEE THAT THEY WERE

208
00:12:10,614 --> 00:12:12,814
SCROLLING ON THEIR PHONES.

209
00:12:12,816 --> 00:12:14,816
SO I'M LIKE, THIS IS SO

210
00:12:14,818 --> 00:12:17,152

WHEN I FOUND MY POWER, I FOUND A

718
00:28:01,130 --> 00:28:01,862
LOVING BOYFRIEND WHO'S WAITING

719
00:28:01,864 --> 00:28:04,498

>> I DON'T WANT YOU TO MEET HIM.

725
00:28:14,443 --> 00:28:17,611
>> WHY NOT?

726
00:28:17,613 --> 00:28:18,512
>> BECAUSE OF HOW HE LOOKS.

727
00:28:18,914 --> 00:28:20,514
>> HOW DOES HE LOOK?

728
00:28:20,516 --> 00:28:20,914
>> NOT GOOD.

729
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,186
>> CAN YOU DESCRIBE HIM?

730
00:28:26,188 --> 00:28:27,054

00:28:42,104 --> 00:28:45,606
>> I DON'T KNOW.

738
00:29:03,758 --> 00:29:07,861
I'M JUST REALIZING YOU ACTUALLY

739
00:29:07,863 --> 00:29:11,064

740

ARE TACTICS LIKE THIS HURTING

1488
01:02:29,429 --> 01:02:29,928
THEIR CAUSE?

1489
01:02:29,930 --> 01:02:31,830
>> I MEAN, IT'S UNLIKELY.

1490
01:02:31,832 --> 01:02:33,431
THIS WAS AN ISOLATED INCIDENT

1491
01:02:33,433 --> 01:02:34,566
AND PROBABLY WON'T SLOW THE

1492

MOVEMENT DOWN.

1493
01:02:35,302 --> 01:02:36,234

JUST LEFT-LEANING CHURCHES ARE

1509
01:03:01,595 --> 01:03:02,327
NOT, YOU KNOW, SO POLITICAL.

1510
01:03:02,329 --> 01:03:02,627
>> HM!

1511
01:03:02,629 --> 01:03:05,297
>> HM!

1512
01:03:05,299 --> 01:03:06,565
>> OKAY, STOP.

1513
01:03:06,567 --> 01:03:07,999
THAT'S NOT AT ALL WHAT I MEANT.

1514
01:03:08,001 --> 01:03:10,135
>> RIGHT, I MEAN, JACKIE KNOWS

1515
01:03:10,137 --> 01:03:12,137
VERY WELL THAT ALL KINDS OF

1516
01:03:12,139 --> 01:03:12,938
PEOPLE ATTEND CHURCH.

1517
01:03:12,940 --> 01:03:13,471
>> YES.

1518
01:03:13,473 --> 01:03:15,674
>> IF IT MATTERS, I'VE STARTED

1519
01:03:15,676 --> 01:03:16,708
GOING AGAIN.

1520
01:03:16,710 --> 01:03:17,242
>> REALLY?

1521
01:03:17,244 --> 01:03:18,043
GOOD FOR YOU.

1522
01:03:18,045 --> 01:03:18,944
>> YEAH.

1523
01:03:18,946 --> 01:03:20,345
EVER SINCE THEY CHANGED IT SO

1524
01:03:20,347 --> 01:03:22,047
YOU DON'T HAVE TO DRESS UP

1525
01:03:22,049 --> 01:03:22,480
ANYMORE.

1526
01:03:22,482 --> 01:03:23,815
I MEAN, HOW NICE IS IT TO WEAR

1527
01:03:23,817 --> 01:03:26,685
JEANS TO CHURCH, RIGHT?

1528
01:03:26,687 --> 01:03:26,985
>> HM!

1529
01:03:26,987 --> 01:03:31,623
>> HM!

1530
01:03:31,625 --> 01:03:32,757
>> LET'S MOVE ON TO

1531
01:03:32,759 --> 01:03:33,525
INTERNATIONAL NEWS.

1532
01:03:33,527 --> 01:03:34,526
THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION

1533
01:03:34,528 --> 01:03:38,563
CONTINUES TO TRY AND TAKE OVER

1534
01:03:38,565 --> 01:03:40,131
GREENLAND DESPITE FORCED

1535
01:03:40,133 --> 01:03:42,033
OPPOSITION FROM EUROPE.

1536
01:03:42,035 --> 01:03:42,934
JACKIE, HOW DOES THIS END?

1537
01:03:42,936 --> 01:03:45,370
>> I DON'T KNOW, BUT I DO KNOW,

1538
01:03:45,372 --> 01:03:47,105
IT'S LIKELY A VIOLATION OF

1539
01:03:47,107 --> 01:03:48,239
INTERNATIONAL LAW.

1540
01:03:48,241 --> 01:03:49,808
YOU CAN'T JUST POINT TO A

1541
01:03:49,810 --> 01:03:52,043
COUNTRY AND SAY, HEY, THAT'S

1542
01:03:52,045 --> 01:03:52,911
OURS NOW!

1543
01:03:52,913 --> 01:03:53,612
>> HM.

1544
01:03:53,614 --> 01:03:53,945
>> HM.

1545
01:03:53,947 --> 01:03:54,679
>> I MEAN, SOME COUNTRIES DO

1546
01:03:54,681 --> 01:03:56,982
THAT, BUT NOT AMERICA.

1547
01:03:56,984 --> 01:03:57,282
>> HM!

1548
01:03:57,284 --> 01:04:01,686
>> HM!

1549
01:04:01,688 --> 01:04:02,087
>> REALLY.

1550
01:04:02,089 --> 01:04:03,955
>> HAS SHE MET AMERICA?

1551
01:04:03,957 --> 01:04:05,090
>> OKAY, ENOUGH.

1552
01:04:05,092 --> 01:04:07,058
WILL YOU GUYS PLEASE STOP MAKING

1553
01:04:07,060 --> 01:04:07,759
THE NOISES?

1554
01:04:07,761 --> 01:04:08,493
>> NOISES?

1555
01:04:08,495 --> 01:04:09,160
WHO'S MAKING NOISES?

1556
01:04:09,162 --> 01:04:11,529
>> I'M SORRY, I DON'T HEAR A

1557
01:04:11,531 --> 01:04:11,830
PEEP.

1558
01:04:11,832 --> 01:04:13,498
>> YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY MAKING

1559
01:04:13,500 --> 01:04:14,532
NOISES, AND IT'S DISTRACTING.

1560
01:04:14,534 --> 01:04:16,034
CAN I AT LEAST GET THROUGH MY

1561
01:04:16,036 --> 01:04:16,668
POINT WITHOUT THE NOISES?

1562
01:04:16,670 --> 01:04:18,203
>> ABSOLUTELY.

1563
01:04:18,205 --> 01:04:19,571
GO AHEAD, AND I PROMISE WE WON'T

1564
01:04:19,573 --> 01:04:20,238
SAY A WORD.

1565
01:04:20,240 --> 01:04:21,906
>> NOT A WORD.

1566
01:04:21,908 --> 01:04:22,574
>> THANK YOU.

1567
01:04:22,576 --> 01:04:23,942
ALL I'M SAYING IS THAT DONALD

1568
01:04:23,944 --> 01:04:25,744
TRUMP MAY WANT TO JUST TAKE

1569
01:04:25,746 --> 01:04:26,611
SOMEONE ELSE'S LAND THROUGH

1570
01:04:26,613 --> 01:04:28,046
GREED AND AGGRESSION, BUT THE

1571
01:04:28,048 --> 01:04:30,015
REST OF US DON'T.

1572
01:04:30,017 --> 01:04:30,749
WE'RE AMERICA.

1573
01:04:30,751 --> 01:04:31,349
THIS IS NOT WHO WE ARE.

1574
01:04:31,351 --> 01:04:35,620
>> HM!

1575
01:04:36,023 --> 01:04:36,554
>> OKAY.

1576
01:04:36,556 --> 01:04:37,255
I THINK THAT GUY JUST MADE A

1577
01:04:37,257 --> 01:04:39,357
NOISE.

1578
01:04:39,359 --> 01:04:42,927
>> SORRY, JACKIE, I'LL ASK OUR

1579
01:04:42,929 --> 01:04:44,696
CAMERAMAN DARIUS NOT TO

1580
01:04:44,698 --> 01:04:45,096
INTERRUPT.

1581
01:04:45,098 --> 01:04:46,931
>> I'M SORRY, AIN'T KNOW Y'ALL

1582
01:04:46,933 --> 01:04:47,866
WAS DOING THAT.

1583
01:04:47,868 --> 01:04:51,803
>> LET'S TAKE A BREAK TO THANK

1584
01:04:51,805 --> 01:04:52,604
OUR CORE BROUGHT SPONSORS.

1585
01:04:52,606 --> 01:04:55,607
WHEN WE RETURN, WE'LL TALK TO A

1586
01:04:55,609 --> 01:04:59,911
WOMAN WHOSE JOB WAS REPLACED BY

1587
01:04:59,913 --> 01:05:00,445
A.I.

1588
01:05:00,447 --> 01:05:03,682
NOT A COMPUTER, THE FORMER NBA

1589
01:05:03,684 --> 01:05:12,757
PLAYER ALLEN IVERSON.

1590
01:05:19,331 --> 01:05:23,334
CHARGED AS MEETING THE PARENTS.

1591
01:05:23,336 --> 01:05:24,102
>> GOD, I'M JUST SO NERVOUS.

1592
01:05:24,104 --> 01:05:24,836
>> DON'T BE NERVOUS, THEY'RE

1593
01:05:24,838 --> 01:05:26,104
GOING TO LOVE YOU.

1594
01:05:26,106 --> 01:05:26,871
>> I DON'T KNOW, MAN.

1595
01:05:26,873 --> 01:05:27,839
I JUST REALLY WANT TO MAKE A

1596
01:05:27,841 --> 01:05:28,606
GOOD IMPRESSION.

1597
01:05:28,608 --> 01:05:29,574
>> YOU WILL.

1598
01:05:29,576 --> 01:05:30,842
YOU'RE GOING TO DO GREAT.

1599
01:05:30,844 --> 01:05:32,110
THEY'RE GOING TO LOVE YOU.

1600
01:05:32,112 --> 01:05:33,078
JUST ONE THING.

1601
01:05:33,080 --> 01:05:34,379
MY DAD'S FROM THE SOUTH.

1602
01:05:34,381 --> 01:05:35,847
>> THE SOUTH?

1603
01:05:35,849 --> 01:05:36,848
>> YEAH, SO HE'S PRETTY

1604
01:05:36,850 --> 01:05:37,849
OLD-FASHIONED.

1605
01:05:37,851 --> 01:05:38,583
SO JUST DON'T TALK POLITICS,

1606
01:05:38,585 --> 01:05:39,117
OKAY?

1607
01:05:39,119 --> 01:05:39,851
>> NO POLITICS.

1608
01:05:39,853 --> 01:05:40,618
>> NO POLITICS.

1609
01:05:40,620 --> 01:05:42,587
>> I CAN DO THAT.

1610
01:05:42,589 --> 01:05:45,356
>> MOM, DAD, WE'RE HOME!

1611
01:05:45,358 --> 01:05:48,793
>> OH!

1612
01:05:48,795 --> 01:05:50,962
>> AVA, THERE'S MY LITTLE GIRL.

1613
01:05:50,964 --> 01:05:51,730
>> AND THIS MUST BE THE GUY THAT

1614
01:05:51,732 --> 01:05:54,799
WE'VE HEARD SO MUCH ABOUT.

1615
01:05:54,801 --> 01:05:56,234
I HOPE THE DRIVE WASN'T TOO BAD.

1616
01:05:56,236 --> 01:05:56,968
>> IT WASN'T.

1617
01:05:56,970 --> 01:05:57,702
>> Y'ALL MADE GREAT TIME COMING

1618
01:05:57,704 --> 01:05:58,236
UP HERE.

1619
01:05:58,238 --> 01:05:58,970
Y'ALL TAKE 87?

1620
01:05:58,972 --> 01:06:01,005
>> Y'ALL TAKE 87?

1621
01:06:08,715 --> 01:06:16,387
>> WELL, LET'S JUST MOVE ON.

1622
01:06:16,389 --> 01:06:20,892
>> FRESHERING A JAB RABBIT --

1623
01:06:20,894 --> 01:06:23,862
THAT'S LITERALLY HOW YOU TALK.

1624
01:06:23,864 --> 01:06:24,596
>> WE HAVE TO BREAK UP NOW.

1625
01:06:24,598 --> 01:06:25,363
>> BUT WHAT IF I TOLD YOU

1626
01:06:25,365 --> 01:06:26,097
BREAKING UP WAS MY GOAL HERE?

1627
01:06:26,099 --> 01:06:26,865
RELATIONSHIPS ARE HARD, AND MEN

1628
01:06:26,867 --> 01:06:27,599
ARE COWARDS.

1629
01:06:27,601 --> 01:06:28,333
SOMETIMES YOU WANT TO BREAK UP

1630
01:06:28,335 --> 01:06:29,100
BUT IT WOULD BE EASIER IF SHE

1631
01:06:29,102 --> 01:06:30,368
BROKE UP WITH YOU.

1632
01:06:30,370 --> 01:06:31,870
I'LL BE TEACHING YOU HOW TO BLOW

1633
01:06:31,872 --> 01:06:32,604
IT SO BAD, YOUR RELATIONSHIP

1634
01:06:32,606 --> 01:06:33,838
EXPLODES.

1635
01:06:33,840 --> 01:06:38,042
WITH METHODS FROM MY NEW BOOK,

1636
01:06:38,044 --> 01:06:40,478
"50 WAYS TO GET YOUR LOVER TO"

1637
01:06:40,480 --> 01:06:43,481
LEAVE YOU BECAUSE LEAVING YOUR

1638
01:06:43,483 --> 01:06:44,215
LOVER IS HARD BECAUSE YOU LOVE

1639
01:06:44,217 --> 01:06:46,785
YOUR LOVER SO WHY NOT GET YOUR

1640
01:06:46,787 --> 01:06:48,219
LOVER TO LEAVE NOW?

1641
01:06:48,221 --> 01:06:48,953
YOU WANT TO CAPITALIZE ON HIGHLY

1642
01:06:48,955 --> 01:06:49,754
CHARGED MOMENTS LIKE MEETING HER

1643
01:06:49,756 --> 01:06:50,221
PARENTS.

1644
01:06:50,223 --> 01:06:51,222
>> WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH

1645
01:06:51,224 --> 01:06:55,293
YOU?

1646
01:06:55,295 --> 01:06:57,028
>> OUT TO LUNCH, STILL AM NOT

1647
01:06:57,030 --> 01:06:57,328
FINE.

1648
01:06:58,231 --> 01:06:58,930
>> BUT ANOTHER HIGHLY CHARGED

1649
01:06:58,932 --> 01:06:59,564
MOMENT IS VALENTINE'S DAY.

1650
01:06:59,566 --> 01:07:00,265
>> BABE, YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO.

1651
01:07:00,267 --> 01:07:00,732
>> OH, I DID.

1652
01:07:00,734 --> 01:07:01,366
I JUST -- I SAW IT, AND I

1653
01:07:01,368 --> 01:07:02,967
IMMEDIATELY THOUGHT OF YOU.

1654
01:07:02,969 --> 01:07:06,237
>> 100 TAMPONS?

1655
01:07:06,239 --> 01:07:06,971
>> A VERY CHARGED MOMENT IS A

1656
01:07:06,973 --> 01:07:08,706
FAMILY FUNERAL.

1657
01:07:08,708 --> 01:07:10,008
IF YOU WANT TO END YOUR

1658
01:07:10,010 --> 01:07:10,708
RELATIONSHIP, TRY SHOWING UP

1659
01:07:10,710 --> 01:07:11,476
DRESSED AS A MEMBER OF THE

1660
01:07:11,478 --> 01:07:14,212
LUMINEERS.

1661
01:07:19,886 --> 01:07:21,519
IF YOU'RE JUST STARTING THE DAY,

1662
01:07:21,521 --> 01:07:24,722
BLOWING IT CAN BE AS SIMPLE

1663
01:07:24,724 --> 01:07:25,456
AS WEARING SOMETHING THAT MAKES

1664
01:07:25,458 --> 01:07:25,924
YOU SEEM GROSS.

1665
01:07:25,926 --> 01:07:30,128
>> SHOULD WE DO A BOTTLE?

1666
01:07:30,130 --> 01:07:31,329
GOING TO HIT THE RESTROOM.

1667
01:07:31,331 --> 01:07:32,597
>> HERE'S ONE.

1668
01:07:32,599 --> 01:07:33,598
THE NEXT TIME SHE COMES TO YOU

1669
01:07:33,600 --> 01:07:35,333
FOR ADVICE ON A COMPLEX

1670
01:07:35,335 --> 01:07:37,101
EMOTIONAL PROBLEM, RESPOND

SORTING HAT FROM HARRY POTTER.
