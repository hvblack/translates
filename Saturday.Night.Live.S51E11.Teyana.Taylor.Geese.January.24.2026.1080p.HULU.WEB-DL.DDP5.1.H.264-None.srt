00:00:19,541 --> 00:00:21,256
>> THANK YOU SO MUCH.

6
00:00:21,256 --> 00:00:24,446
IT TRULY IS AN HONOR TO BE HERE
HOSTING THE TRUMPS.

7
00:00:24,446 --> 00:00:28,784
AFTER THAT LADY WHOSE NAME I
ALREADY FORGET GAVE ME HER NOBEL
PRIZE,

8
00:00:28,784 --> 00:00:31,181
I THOUGHT, I NEED MORE
AWARDS.

9
00:00:31,181 --> 00:00:35,197
AND AFTER ALL WHAT OUR LITTLE
FREAKS AND PSYCHOS IN I.C.E. HAVE BEEN DOING,

10
00:00:35,197 --> 00:00:36,715
I NEED MORE
DISTRACTIONS.

11
00:00:36,715 --> 00:00:39,890
LOOK,
EVERYTHING'S GOING TO CHINA.

12
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:42,233
WHAT A CROWD WE HAVE TONIGHT.

13
00:00:42,233 --> 00:00:44,711
SO MANY AWFUL, TERRIBLE PEOPLE
IN THE HOUSE.

14
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:47,766
I'D LIKE TO GET A ROUND OF
APPLAUSE GOING FOR THE NOMINEES,

15
00:00:47,766 --> 00:00:49,540
BUT MY DOCTORS SAY IF I CLAP

16
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:52,873
BOTH MY DEAD PURPLE HANDS WILL
EXPLODE WITH BLOOD.

17
00:00:52,873 --> 00:00:54,921
PROBABLY NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT.

18
00:00:54,921 --> 00:01:00,245
DOCTORS SAY I COULD LIVE TO BE
120, OR CURRENT AGE.

19
00:01:00,245 --> 00:01:02,469
YOU KNOW, THIS IS SUCH A SPECIAL
NIGHT.

20
00:01:02,469 --> 00:01:04,900
EVERYONE WANTS TO GO HOME WITH A
TRUMP.

21
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:08,247
EXCEPT, OF COURSE, MELANIA.

22
00:01:08,247 --> 00:01:09,454
HILARIOUS.

>> THIS IS DONALD TRUMP'S FIRST
TRUMP AWARD,

41
00:02:18,042 --> 00:02:22,637
EVEN THOUGH HE
COULD HAVE EARNED HUNDREDS OF

IT.

42
00:02:22,637 --> 00:02:26,531
>> WOW, WOW, THIS FEELS
INCREDIBLE.

43

I HAVE SO FEW PEOPLE TO THANK.
MYSELF, AND OF COURSE, THE BIG MAN UPSTAIRS,

WHICH IS WHAT I
CALL MY BRAIN TUMOR, YOW!

46
00:02:36,958 --> 00:02:40,894

47
00:02:40,894 --> 00:02:44,154
GOING ON IN OUR

00:06:04,665 --> 00:06:06,259
NO, NOT ALL LAUGHS.

94
00:06:06,259 --> 00:06:11,190

AND I'M SO HONORED TO BE HOSTING
SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE!

115
00:09:48,924 --> 00:09:52,781
NOW, I'M A HARLEM GIRL, AND I
LOVE NEW YORK.

116
00:09:52,781 --> 00:09:54,084
BUT IT'S FREEZING OUT HERE.

117
00:09:54,084 --> 00:09:58,314
THAT'S WHY I HAD TO GET A SPOT
IN MIAMI BECAUSE THE BITCH WAS
COLD.

118
00:09:58,314 --> 00:10:01,460
NO WONDER WHY US NEW YORKERS, WE
SO AGITATED,

119
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:03,460
BECAUSE WE COLD.

120
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:06,883
THIS WEEK HAS BEEN VERY INSANE.

121
00:10:06,883 --> 00:10:11,264
I WAS NOMINATED FOR AN OSCAR FOR
ONE BATTLE AFTER ANOTHER.

122
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:16,772
IT IS A DREAM COME TRUE.

123
00:10:16,772 --> 00:10:19,833
I FOUND OUT THE WAY EVERY LITTLE
GIRL WANTS TO FIND OUT.

124
00:10:19,833 --> 00:10:23,694
GET FITTED FOR A BALD CAP NEXT
TO MIKEY DAY.

125
00:10:23,694 --> 00:10:28,718
ALL OF THIS IS KIND OF
OVERWHELMING BECAUSE I AM A
REALLY SHY PERSON, BELIEVE IT OR NOT,

126
00:10:28,718 --> 00:10:31,166
WHO DOES NOT LIKE A LOT OF
ATTENTION.

127
00:10:31,166 --> 00:10:35,439
FOR EXAMPLE, HERE'S ME AT MY
16th BIRTHDAY PARTY.

128
00:10:44,035 --> 00:10:46,783
YEAH, YEAH.

129
00:10:48,302 --> 00:10:52,409
YES, I WAS ON MTV'S "MY SUPER
SWEET 16."

130
00:10:52,409 --> 00:10:56,371
I'VE HAD THE CHANCE TO DO SO
MANY THINGS IN MY LIFE.

131
00:10:56,371 --> 00:10:59,912
FROM SINGING TO DANCING TO
ACTING TO DIRECTING.

132
00:10:59,912 --> 00:11:04,500
AND YES, I AM CURRENTLY IN
CULINARY SCHOOL, CHEFFING IT UP,

133
00:11:06,513 --> 00:11:11,458
HELL, I RANDOMLY WON "MAD SING
IR"DRESSED AS A FIREFLY, FOR
REAL.

134
00:11:11,458 --> 00:11:14,354
ME, I CONSIDER MYSELF A GLADE
PLUG-IN.

135
00:11:14,354 --> 00:11:19,074
WHY ONLY PLUG ME IN THE BATHROOM
WHEN I CAN MAKE THE WHOLE
BUILDING SMELL GOOD?

136
00:11:19,074 --> 00:11:22,952
ALSO, I AM A MOM.
PEOPLE ASK WHEN I SLEEP.

137
00:11:22,952 --> 00:11:26,406
DON'T WORRY, I GET A FULL EIGHT
HOURS

138
00:11:26,406 --> 00:11:28,365
A WEEK.

139
00:11:28,365 --> 00:11:31,229
BOTH MY PREGNANCIES WERE VERY,
VERY PEACEFUL.

140
00:11:31,229 --> 00:11:33,721
I DID ALL THE THINGS I WAS
SUPPOSED TO DO.

141
00:11:33,721 --> 00:11:37,364
I WAS GOING TO YOGA, TAKING
VITAMINS AVOIDING RAW FISH.

142
00:11:37,364 --> 00:11:40,252
I THINK WE HAVE A VIDEO OF ME
PREGNANT RIGHT HERE.

143
00:11:44,485 --> 00:11:46,699
SEE

144
00:11:47,993 --> 00:11:52,220
YES.
SO WHOLESOME, SO CALM.

145
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:54,344
MAN, I REALLY, REALLY LOVE MY
KIDS SO MUCH.

146
00:11:54,344 --> 00:11:56,382
I BRING THEM EVERYWHERE WITH ME.
FRONT

147
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:59,039
BUT WHEN I WAS GIVING MY SPEECH
AT THE GOLDEN GLOBES,

148
00:11:59,039 --> 00:12:02,547
I LOOKED
UP TO SEE MY BABIES, I WANTED TO
SEE THEY FACES, YOU KNOW?

149
00:12:02,547 --> 00:12:05,235
JUST TO SEE THAT THEY WERE
SCROLLING ON THEIR PHONES.

150
00:12:05,235 --> 00:12:09,283

SALTERS WITH AN UPDATE.

297
00:20:29,017 --> 00:20:32,183
>> THE BRONCOS HAVE NOTHING TO
BE ASHAMED OF.

298
00:20:32,183 --> 00:20:35,677
THEY HAD A GREAT SEASON AND
SHOULDN'T HOLD BACK THEIR HEADS,
HOLD THEIR HEADS HIGH.

299
00:20:35,677 --> 00:20:38,401
I'M SURE THEY'LL AN TEAM TO
WATCH NEXT YEAR.

300
00:20:38,401 --> 00:20:40,558
>> LISA, THE GAME HASN'T STARTED
YET.

301
00:20:40,558 --> 00:20:42,795
THINK YOU'RE WRITING OFF THE
BRONCOS A LITTLE EARLY?

302
00:20:42,795 --> 00:20:44,892
>> I MEAN, COME ON.

303
00:20:44,892 --> 00:20:48,101
THEY AIN'T GOT NO QUARTERBACK.
LIKE, COME ON.

304
00:20:48,101 --> 00:20:51,589
>> LISA, DENVER IS A VERY
CAPABLE TEAM.
THEY COULD WIN.

305
00:20:51,589 --> 00:20:54,516
>> YEAH.
BUT LIKE -- COME ON.

306

>> WELL.
DENVER WILL START BACKUP JARRETT
STIDHAM, WHO HASN'T PLAYED A
SNAP ALL YEAR.

308
00:21:00,755 --> 00:21:03,901
>> I LIKE THE GUY, I THINK HE
COULD SURPRISE US.

309
00:21:03,901 --> 00:21:07,773
>> SPEAKING OF SURPRISES, ONE
PART SUGAR AND ALL PART SPICE

310
00:21:07,773 --> 00:21:09,585
ON
AN ALL-NEW "QUEFS."

311
00:21:09,585 --> 00:21:13,845
THINGS ARE HEATING UP IN THE
KITCHEN.
FOR

312
00:21:13,845 --> 00:21:16,359
BUT IF BRIDGETTE HAS HER WAY,

313
00:21:16,359 --> 00:21:20,037
IT'S D-DAY.
THREE

314
00:21:20,037 --> 00:21:22,447
FEATURING MUSIC BY SUAVE.

315
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:24,701
IT'S "QUEFS, THAT PART."

316
00:21:24,701 --> 00:21:28,389
>> I THOUGHT SUAVE WAS JUST AN
ACTOR.

317
00:21:28,389 --> 00:21:30,489
>> THERE'S NO WAY YOU KNOW WHO
THAT IS.

318
00:21:30,489 --> 00:21:32,163
>> I DO NOT, JOE.

319
00:21:32,163 --> 00:21:35,680
>> NOW, I'M SEEING LISA HAS SOME
NEWS ON THE DENVER QUARTERBACK

321
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:40,277

I DON'T KNOW WHERE HE IS BUT I
HAVE AN UPDATE FROM HIS FAN.

322
00:21:40,277 --> 00:21:44,077
SIR, WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

323
00:21:44,077 --> 00:21:46,535
>> WHO, NOW?

324
00:21:46,535 --> 00:21:48,772
I'M DENVER'S STARTING
QUARTERBACK TONIGHT.

325
00:21:48,772 --> 00:21:52,533

GREAT SEASON, AND BETTER LUCK
NEXT YEAR.

326
00:21:52,533 --> 00:21:55,611
>> WAIT, HOLD ON, LISA.
WE'VE GOT A GREAT TEAM HERE.

327
00:21:55,611 --> 00:21:57,049
I THINK WE CAN WIN THIS THING.

328
00:21:57,049 --> 00:22:00,635
>> YEAH, BUT JARRETT -- COME ON.

329
00:22:00,635 --> 00:22:02,955

>> OH, WELL, SO THAT'S JARRETT
STIDHAM.

331
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:06,866
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT'S WHAT HE
LOOKED LIKE.
>> NO ONE DID.

332
00:22:06,866 --> 00:22:11,563
ONE THING I DO KNOW IS "QUEFS"
IS BACK AND I AM PHAT.

333
00:22:11,563 --> 00:22:14,593
THIS WEEK ON "QUEFS,"

FILLETS WITH A SIDE OF SLAY.

WATCHING QUEFS."

339
00:22:31,074 --> 00:22:33,324
QUEFS, IT'S GIVING QUEFS.

340
00:22:33,324 --> 00:22:36,092
>> TOLD YOU SUAVE WAS AN ACTOR.

341
00:22:36,092 --> 00:22:37,942

TITLE?

347
00:22:50,607 --> 00:22:52,777
QUEFS.
IT SOUNDS WEIRD, RIGHT?

348
00:22:52,777 --> 00:22:54,329
ADD ONE MORE LETTER AND IT'S --

349
00:22:54,329 --> 00:22:56,316
>> OKAY, THANK YOU SO MUCH,
LISA.

350
00:22:56,316 --> 00:22:59,130
NO NEED TO SAY IT OUT LOUD.
I THINK EVERYBODY CLOCKED THAT.

351
00:22:59,130 --> 00:23:03,253
LET'S GO NOW TO OUR "KEYS TO THE
GAME" BROUGHT TO YOU BY FAN

00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:27,306
QUEFS.
THEY AIN'T BEEN HAD TO DO ALL
THAT, MAMA.

359
00:23:27,306 --> 00:23:30,030
>> WHOA, BO NIX IS ON "TALKING
QUEFS."
THAT'S HUGE.

360
00:23:30,030 --> 00:23:31,411

365
00:24:18,472 --> 00:24:21,443
I'M CASSIDY FLASK,

368
00:24:29,831 --> 00:24:35,318

GAL IN FRONT OF YOU ONCE HAD NO
CONFIDENCE.

369
00:24:35,318 --> 00:24:39,541
I REMEMBER I ONCE LOST OUT ON A
JOB I REALLY WANTED.

370
00:24:39,541 --> 00:24:42,887
AND THEN I WAS LIKE, A JOB
DOESN'T DEFINE ME,

371
00:24:42,887 --> 00:24:44,684
I DEFINE ME.

372
00:24:44,684 --> 00:24:48,324
AND THAT'S HOW I FOUND THE POWER
IN ME.

373
00:24:48,324 --> 00:24:50,506
ANY QUESTIONS BEFORE WE START?

374
00:24:50,506 --> 00:24:53,519
>> WHY DIDN'T YOU GET THE JOB?

375
00:24:53,519 --> 00:24:58,571
>> SORRY?
>> THE JOB YOU WANTED.
WHY DIDN'T YOU GET IT?

376
00:24:58,571 --> 00:25:00,583
>> JUST DIDN'T GO ANY WAY.

377
00:25:00,583 --> 00:25:02,935
NOW, LET'S GET STARTED.

378
00:25:02,935 --> 00:25:05,966
>> DID THEY JUST NOT LIKE YOU?

379
00:25:06,809 --> 00:25:09,301
>> I JUST DIDN'T GET IT.

380
00:25:09,301 --> 00:25:13,329
NOW, THE JOB STORY'S JUST PART
OF MY INTRO, SO LET'S --

00:25:18,473 --> 00:25:22,443

THE INTERVIEW?

384
00:25:22,443 --> 00:25:25,401
>> NO.
>> WELL, THERE YOU GO.

385
00:25:25,401 --> 00:25:28,978

THAT WOULD HAVE STUNG.

386
00:25:28,978 --> 00:25:32,797
BUT NOW I HEAR IT, AND I DON'T
FEAR IT.

PANTS AND LEATHER GLOVES.

392
00:25:51,177 --> 00:25:52,817
JUST LET IT GO.

393
00:25:53,087 --> 00:25:56,256
>> OKAY, WELL -- THAT'S WHY SHE
DIDN'T GET THE JOB.

394
00:25:56,256 --> 00:25:59,578
>> OKAY.
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M GOING TO GET US BACK ON
TRACK.

395
00:25:59,578 --> 00:26:01,833
WHAT'S IMPORTANT IS FIRST
IMPRESSIONS.

396
00:26:01,833 --> 00:26:05,942
RULE NUMBER ONE.
SHOW THEM WHAT YOU'RE WORKING
WITH IT.

397
00:26:06,508 --> 00:26:10,326
LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT A SAMPLE
RESUME.

398
00:26:12,784 --> 00:26:16,911

399
00:26:16,911 --> 00:26:17,981
>> YEAH.

400
00:26:17,981 --> 00:26:20,840
WHAT DO WE NOTICE?
WHAT ARE WE SEEING HERE?

401
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:24,779
>> THAT YOU TAKE SELFIES LIKE AN
UBER DRIVER.

402
00:26:27,565 --> 00:26:29,862
>> YEAH. IT SAYS

403
00:26:29,862 --> 00:26:34,172
"DO VOICES AND PERSONAL
COMPUTER NO."

404
00:26:34,172 --> 00:26:38,310
>> IT ALSO SAY FROM 2014 TO 2025,

405
00:26:38,310 --> 00:26:41,371
YOU WERE A DOLLY PARTON
IMPERSONATOR.

406
00:26:41,371 --> 00:26:43,187
>> CAN WE SEE YOUR DOLLY PARTON?

407
00:26:43,187 --> 00:26:46,874
>> OKAY, GUYS, I DON'T HAVE THE
BOOBS WITH ME RIGHT NOW,

408
00:26:46,874 --> 00:26:49,342
AND
THAT WAS MOST OF IT, OKAY?

409
00:26:49,342 --> 00:26:52,375
>> I'M SORRY, WITH THAT RESUME,

410
00:26:52,375 --> 00:26:56,173
WHAT JOB COULD YOU HAVE POSSIBLY
BEEN INTERVIEWING FOR?

411
00:26:56,173 --> 00:26:59,831
>> OH, MY GOD, FINE.
SPEECHWRITER FOR MICHELLE OBAMA,
OKAY?

412
00:26:59,831 --> 00:27:02,289
>> WORD!
>> NO.

413
00:27:02,289 --> 00:27:04,658
>> OH, MY GOD, THERE'S A WRITING
SAMPLE AT THE BOTTOM.

414
00:27:04,658 --> 00:27:06,207
>> WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
IT SAYS,

415
00:27:06,207 --> 00:27:11,009
WHEN THEY GO LOW, WE GO
HIGH.
AM I RIGHT?

416
00:27:11,009 --> 00:27:13,074
SO WHERE'S EVERYBODY FROM?

417
00:27:13,074 --> 00:27:15,474
YOU IN THE FRONT, ARE YOU TWO A
COUPLE?

418
00:27:15,474 --> 00:27:19,136
THE GUY IN THE DORK-ASS HAT NEXT
TO THE GIRL WHO'S WAY OUT OF HIS
LEAGUE?

419
00:27:19,136 --> 00:27:22,707
MICHELLE LAUGHS THEN AD LIBS THE
REST OF THE SPEECH.

420
00:27:23,064 --> 00:27:28,048
>> YOU WROTE MICHELLE OBAMA
DOING CROWD WORK?

421
00:27:28,048 --> 00:27:30,365
>> GUYS, DO YOU WANT CONFIDENCE
OR NOT?

422
00:27:30,365 --> 00:27:33,509
>> I'M NOT REALLY SURE ANYMORE.

423
00:27:33,509 --> 00:27:35,627
>> WELL, I'M SURE ABOUT THIS.

424
00:27:35,627 --> 00:27:39,196
RULE NUMBER TWO.
CLOTHES TELL THE STORY.

425
00:27:39,196 --> 00:27:40,835
>> OH, NO.

426
00:27:40,835 --> 00:27:44,516
>> IS THAT YOUR BATHROOM?

427
00:27:44,516 --> 00:27:47,578
>> YOU KNOW WHAT, YOU GUYS ARE
MISSING THE LESSONS.

428
00:27:47,578 --> 00:27:49,701
LET'S SHAKE THIS OFF, HUH?
LET'S SHAKE THIS OFF.

429
00:27:49,701 --> 00:27:53,151
RELATIONSHIPS.
WHEN I FOUND MY POWER,

430
00:27:53,151 --> 00:27:58,034
I FOUND A
LOVING BOYFRIEND WHO'S WAITING
OUTSIDE FOR ME RIGHT NOW.

431
00:27:58,034 --> 00:28:01,928
>> HE'S OUTSIDE RIGHT NOW?
>> YES.

432
00:28:01,928 --> 00:28:06,191
>> CAN YOU BRING HIM IN SO WE
CAN MEET HIM?

433
00:28:06,191 --> 00:28:08,851
>> I DON'T WANT YOU TO MEET HIM.

434
00:28:08,851 --> 00:28:12,878
>> WHY NOT?
>> BECAUSE OF HOW HE LOOKS.

435
00:28:12,878 --> 00:28:17,183
>> HOW DOES HE LOOK?
>> NOT GOOD.

436
00:28:17,183 --> 00:28:20,467
>> CAN YOU DESCRIBE HIM?
>> OH, MY GOD.

437
00:28:20,467 --> 00:28:23,405
HE LOOKS LIKE IF A GOBLIN LIVED
IN NEW YORK.

438
00:28:23,405 --> 00:28:27,596
>> OH, MY GOD.
>> HEY, ARE YOU OKAY?

439
00:28:30,256 --> 00:28:32,940
>> I DON'T KNOW.

440
00:28:33,423 --> 00:28:35,686
>> ARE YOU?

441
00:28:36,418 --> 00:28:39,182
>> I DON'T KNOW.

442
00:28:55,161 --> 00:28:57,945
DISMISSED

I'M JUST REALIZING

YOU ACTUALLY
MADE ME FEEL WAY MORE CONFIDENT.

445
00:29:04,365 --> 00:29:07,706
AFTER MEETING YOU, I REALLY FEEL
AMAZING ABOUT MYSELF.

446
00:29:07,706 --> 00:29:10,641
>> YEAH.
>> ME TOO.
>> ME TOO.

447
00:29:10,641 --> 00:29:13,422
>> THEN MY JOB HERE IS DONE.

448
00:29:13,422 --> 00:29:16,291
DO YOU GUYS WANT TO SEE MY DOLLY
PARTON?

449
00:29:16,291 --> 00:29:18,673
>> SURE.

WEEKEND

478
00:34:06,042 --> 00:34:08,780
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
GOOD EVENING, EVERYONE, THANK
YOU.

479
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:12,472
>> WELCOME TO "WEEKEND UPDATE,"
I'M MICHAEL CHE.
>> I'M COLIN JOST.

480
00:34:13,305 --> 00:34:16,943
WELL, DURING A PRESS CONFERENCE
CELEBRATING HIS FIRST YEAR IN OFFICE,

481
00:34:16,943 --> 00:34:22,176
PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID
THAT GOD WAS VERY PROUD OF THE
JOB HE'S DOING AS PRESIDENT.

482
00:34:22,176 --> 00:34:26,104
TRUMP ADDED THAT GOD WAS
PROBABLY LOOKING UP AT US RIGHT
NOW.

483
00:34:26,104 --> 00:34:29,149
SMILING FROM HORN TO HOOF.

484
00:34:29,149 --> 00:34:34,091
ALSO, REMEMBER WHEN PRESIDENT
TRUMP STRAIGHT-UP TOLD US HE WAS
GOING TO HELL?

485
00:34:34,091 --> 00:34:38,226
>> I THINK -- I THINK I'M NOT
MAYBE HEAVEN-BOUND.

486
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:45,142
>> BUT HE THINKS THAT AFTER THIS
WEEK, GOD IS BACK ON BOARD.

487
00:34:45,142 --> 00:34:49,974
>>> VICE PRESIDENT J.D. VANCE
CRITICIZED PROTESTERS
CONFRONTING I.C.E. OFFICERS,

488
00:34:49,974 --> 00:34:54,071
SAYING THEY SHOULD INSTEAD WRITE
AN OP-ED OR ARGUE ABOUT IT ON
SOCIAL MEDIA.

489
00:34:54,071 --> 00:34:57,818
YOU KNOW, JUST LIKE THESE YOUNG
SCHOLARS DID ON JANUARY 6th.

490
00:34:57,818 --> 00:35:01,079
I GET THAT I.C.E. AGENTS ARE
PEOPLE, ALLEGEDLY.

491
00:35:01,079 --> 00:35:03,254
AND THEY HAVE A JOB TO DO.

492
00:35:03,254 --> 00:35:07,132
BUT AT SOME POINT, WHILE YOU'RE
PEPPER SPRAYING OLD LADIES OR SHOOTING AT A NURSE,

493
00:35:07,132 --> 00:35:10,979
DO YOU EVER
STOP AND ASK YOURSELF, ARE WE
DICKS?

494
00:35:11,774 --> 00:35:16,359
>>> PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS BEEN
INVITING WORLD LEADERS TO JOIN HIS BOARD OF PEACE,

495
00:35:16,359 --> 00:35:20,604
OR BE
CRUSHED BY HIS COUNCIL OF
DESTRUCTION.

496
00:35:21,392 --> 00:35:26,511
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S BOARD OF PEACE
CONSISTS OF COUNTRIES SUCH AS
RUSSIA AND SAUDI ARABIA,

497
00:35:26,511 --> 00:35:31,716
WHICH
IS LIKE IF "LAW AND ORDER SVU"
STARRED DIDDY.

498
00:35:33,246 --> 00:35:37,303
>>> PRESIDENT TRUMP CALLED OFF
HIS PROPOSED TARIFFS ON EUROPEAN COUNTRIES

499
00:35:37,303 --> 00:35:39,716
WHO OPPOSE HIS DESIRE
TO ACQUIRE GREENLAND.

500
00:35:39,716 --> 00:35:43,091
TRUMP BACKED DOWN AFTER
CONSULTING HIS MOST TRUSTED ADVISER,

501
00:35:43,091 --> 00:35:45,394
THE STOCKS APP.

502
00:35:45,394 --> 00:35:49,170
>>> THE SINGING OF THE U.S.
NATIONAL ANTHEM AT A NBA GAME IN LONDON

503
00:35:49,170 --> 00:35:52,729
WAS INTERRUPTED BY
PROTESTERS YELLING, "LEAVE GREENLAND ALONE."

504
00:35:52,729 --> 00:35:55,725
YOU KNOW WE'VE GONE TOO FAR WHEN
THE BRITISH ARE LIKE,

505
00:35:55,725 --> 00:35:58,735
EASY ON
THE COLONIZING, CHUMP.

506
00:35:59,595 --> 00:36:04,643
PSYCHO

507
00:36:04,643 --> 00:36:07,340
BASICALLY BECOME
LIKE A GUY ON A DATING APP.

508
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:10,238
"HEY, GREENLAND, YOU LOOK SO"
GOOD."

509
00:36:10,238 --> 00:36:13,172
GREENLAND'S LIKE, "THANKS."

510
00:36:13,172 --> 00:36:15,982
TRUMP'S LIKE, "SERIOUSLY, I NEED
YOU.

511
00:36:15,982 --> 00:36:19,622
I'D LITERALLY GIVE $700 BILLION
TO BE WITH YOU."

512
00:36:19,622 --> 00:36:23,614
"LOOK, NOT TRYING TO BE MEAN BUT"
I'M NOT INTERESTED.

513
00:36:23,614 --> 00:36:27,615
TRUMP'S LIKE, "I'LL KILL YOU,
YOU UGLY BITCH!"

514
00:36:31,171 --> 00:36:33,426
JUST OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD.
>> YEAH, SURE.

515
00:36:33,426 --> 00:36:36,485
>>> THE HOUSE OVERSIGHT
COMMITTEE ANNOUNCED THAT NEXT MONTH,

516
00:36:36,485 --> 00:36:40,895
IT WILL DEPOSE GHISLAINE
MAXWELL AS PART OF ITS JEFFREY
EPSTEIN INVESTIGATION.

517
00:36:40,895 --> 00:36:43,581
IN THE MEANTIME, THEY'VE TURNED
OFF THE CAMERAS TO GIVE HER PRIVACY

518
00:36:43,581 --> 00:36:46,879
TO PLAY WITH HER NEW
CHAIR AND LONG ROPE.

519
00:36:49,272 --> 00:36:52,713
>> YEAH, YEAH, TAKE HER SIDE.

520
00:36:52,713 --> 00:36:57,505
>>> WITH GEN-Z TERPS LIKE COOKED
AND AURA GAINING POPULARITY,

521
00:36:57,505 --> 00:36:59,782
OLDER PEOPLE ARE FEELING OUT OF
THE LOOP.

522
00:36:59,782 --> 00:37:04,893
HERE TO ACT AS OUR GEN-Z
TRANSLATER, OUR VERY OWN
MARCELLO HERNANDEZ.

523
00:37:04,893 --> 00:37:08,917
>> YEAH, WHAT'S UP?
WHAT'S UP, COLIN?

524
00:37:08,917 --> 00:37:12,061
>> WHAT'S UP?
YOU ARE HERE TO TRANSLATE SOME
GEN-Z SLANG.

525
00:37:12,061 --> 00:37:15,864
>> YES, I AM, TO HELP OUT OLDER
FOLKS LIKE YOU.

526
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:19,127
>> WE'RE BASICALLY THE SAME AGE.

527
00:37:19,127 --> 00:37:21,390
>> HA HA, NEVER GIVE UP.

528
00:37:22,143 --> 00:37:25,865
THE FIRST WORD I WANT TO HELP
TRANSLATE IS CHOPPED.

529
00:37:25,865 --> 00:37:28,631
THIS ONE IS BIG.
YOU'VE PROBABLY HEARD IT BEFORE.

530
00:37:28,631 --> 00:37:32,099
>> YEAH, I KNOW CHOPPED, IT'S
THE SHOW ON THE FOOD NETWORK.

531
00:37:32,099 --> 00:37:34,229
>> HA HA, NEVER GIVE UP.

532
00:37:34,229 --> 00:37:38,104
NO, CHOPPED IS AN ADJECTIVE USED
TO DESCRIBE SOMETHING

533
00:37:38,104 --> 00:37:39,941
THAT IS
VISUALLY UNAPPEALING.

534
00:37:39,941 --> 00:37:44,028
FOR EXAMPLE, THIS PICTURE OF
COLIN FROM MIDDLE SCHOOL.

535
00:37:44,028 --> 00:37:46,805
IS CHOPPED.

536
00:37:46,805 --> 00:37:48,981
>> DID YOU GET IT FROM MY PARENTS

537
00:37:48,981 --> 00:37:53,299
IN THE JOKE'S ON YOU,
THAT PICTURE IS ACTUALLY OF ME
FROM COLLEGE.

538
00:37:55,210 --> 00:37:57,267
>> WORSE.

539
00:37:57,267 --> 00:38:02,116
BUT THAT'S RIGHT.
YOU HAVE EXPERIENCED WHAT WE
CALL A GLO-UP.

540
00:38:02,116 --> 00:38:04,750
YOU WENT FROM BUSTED

541
00:38:04,750 --> 00:38:08,393
TO, HEAR ME OUT, THOUGH.

542
00:38:09,421 --> 00:38:10,935
>> THANKS.

543
00:38:10,935 --> 00:38:14,366
SO HOW ARE YOU NOT -- WHY ARE
YOU NOT TEACHING ANY OF THIS
STUFF TO CHE?

544
00:38:14,366 --> 00:38:19,149
>> CHE KNOWS THIS STUFF BECAUSE
GEN-Z SLANG IS AFRICAN AMERICAN
SLANG.

545
00:38:19,149 --> 00:38:21,787
BASICALLY, BLACK PEOPLE START
SAYING SOMETHING,

546
00:38:21,787 --> 00:38:24,549
YOUNG PEOPLE
THINK IT'S COOL SO THEY START SAYING IT,

547
00:38:24,549 --> 00:38:26,022
THEN WHITE PEOPLE SAY
IT.

548
00:38:26,022 --> 00:38:29,581
THEN ONCE ELON MUSK SAYS IT,
IT'S OVER.

549
00:38:29,581 --> 00:38:33,127
>> OH NO, MAN.
THAT'S CAP.

550
00:38:35,645 --> 00:38:39,998
WAIT, WHAT'S THAT SOUND?

551
00:38:41,258 --> 00:38:44,765
>> "CAP" HAS OFFICIALLY PASSED
AWAY.
>> NO,

552
00:38:44,765 --> 00:38:47,898
NO!

553
00:38:47,898 --> 00:38:49,307
>> R.I.P., CAP.

554
00:38:49,307 --> 00:38:52,146
>> YOU'RE NOT TEACHING US
ANYTHING, BY THE WAY.

555
00:38:52,146 --> 00:38:53,882
>> OKAY, BOOMER.

556
00:38:53,882 --> 00:38:58,292
MAYBE IT WOULD HELP IF I USE
GEN-Z TERMS TO TALK ABOUT
SOMETHING YOU'RE INTO.

557
00:38:58,292 --> 00:38:59,965
SO WHAT IS ONE OF YOUR
INTERESTS?

558
00:38:59,965 --> 00:39:02,832
>> "REAL HOUSEWIVES OF SALT LAKE
CITY."

559
00:39:02,832 --> 00:39:05,759
SALTY THROUGH AND THROUGH.

560
00:39:05,759 --> 00:39:08,763
AND THEN, I DON'T KNOW, WORLD
WAR II?

561
00:39:11,007 --> 00:39:15,442
>> ALL RIGHT.
LET'S DO WORLD WAR II.
>> OKAY, SURE.

562
00:39:15,442 --> 00:39:17,011
>> SO, OKAY.
WORLD WAR II, OKAY.

563
00:39:17,011 --> 00:39:22,081
SO BASICALLY, AFTER WORLD WAR I,
GERMANY'S ECONOMY WAS IN A FLOP
ERA.

564
00:39:22,081 --> 00:39:25,145
SO THEY STARTED MOVING OUT OF
POCKET THANKS TO HITLER,

565
00:39:25,145 --> 00:39:27,447
WHO WAS
A CERTIFIED CRASHOUT.

566
00:39:27,447 --> 00:39:29,844
THEN HE BECAME THE WORLD'S OP,

567
00:39:29,844 --> 00:39:33,061
SO HE GOT HIGH-KEY OVERSTIMULATED

568
00:39:33,061 --> 00:39:36,255
AND THEN HE
LOW-KEY UNALIVED HIMSELF.

569
00:39:36,255 --> 00:39:40,127
AND THEN EVERYBODY WAS LIKE,
FAH!

570
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:46,133
>> THAT WAS AWESOME, YEAH.
AND MADE TOTAL SENSE.

571
00:39:46,133 --> 00:39:48,955
I GUESS YOU COULD SAY HITLER WAS
CHOPPED.

572
00:39:49,601 --> 00:39:54,418
NO, NO, NOT AGAIN, NO.

573
00:39:54,418 --> 00:39:56,513
>> R.I.P. CHOPPED.

574
00:39:56,513 --> 00:40:00,234
>> OH, NO.
OH, GOD.

575
00:40:00,234 --> 00:40:03,067
ALL RIGHT.
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT, MAN?

576
00:40:03,067 --> 00:40:07,094
STOP PLAYING IN MY FACE, OKAY?
BE SO FOR REAL.

577
00:40:07,094 --> 00:40:10,390
YOU COME TO MY DESK TRYING TO DRAG ME

578
00:40:10,390 --> 00:40:14,285
WHEN YOU'RE THE ONE
SIPPING THE DUMB BITCH JUICE?

579
00:40:14,834 --> 00:40:18,251
OKAY, YOU MUST BE DELULU, BOO-BOO,

580
00:40:18,251 --> 00:40:22,370
I'M ABOUT TO
CUMBERBATCH OUT RIGHT NOW.
FAH!

581
00:40:24,345 --> 00:40:29,110
>> I THINK I SPEAK FOR ALL OF US
WHEN I SAY, THAT WAS REALLY GOOD
AND YOU DID YOUR BEST.
>> OH, THANKS, MAN.

582
00:40:29,110 --> 00:40:31,404
>> BUT I HAVE BAD NEWS FOR YOU,
COLIN.

583
00:40:31,404 --> 00:40:33,503
>> NO!

584
00:40:33,503 --> 00:40:36,908
MARCELLO HERNANDEZ, EVERYONE!

585
00:40:41,986 --> 00:40:46,119
>>> A NEW REPORT SHOWS THAT

FAME BEHIND STEVIE WONDER.

594
00:41:19,181 --> 00:41:24,304

MADE HER A PLAQUE.

WOMEN IN CAR ACCIDENTS.

YOU CAN TELL THE DUMMY IS FEMALE

604
00:41:58,771 --> 00:42:03,055
BECAUSE SOMETIMES IT JUST PUTS
THE CAR IN PARK AND CRIES A

OH, I'M AFRAID THIS MAN'S BONES
ARE ALL GONE.

740
00:51:25,304 --> 00:51:27,749
THEY ALL BROKE AT ONCE AND
TURNED TO POWDER.

741
00:51:27,749 --> 00:51:29,698
THERE'S NOTHING I CAN DO FOR
HIM.

742
00:51:29,698 --> 00:51:35,302
>> BUT MAYBE THERE'S SOMETHING I
CAN DO.

I'M LOOKING TO HANG OUT WITH YOU

772
00:53:34,357 --> 00:53:37,379
WHEN MY COLLEGE
FRIENDS STOPPED TALKING TO ME.

773
00:53:37,379 --> 00:53:42,776

787
00:54:22,234 --> 00:54:25,993
I CAN JOKE ABOUT IT OR JUST BE
QUIET, WHATEVER YOU WANT.

788
00:54:25,993 --> 00:54:28,617
YOU TAKE THE LEAD, AND I'LL
FOLLOW.

MINE.

796
00:54:48,155 --> 00:54:50,649
SERIOUSLY?
I'M GETTING A RASH!

THANK
BEYOND THE HEADLINES

833
01:00:41,844 --> 01:00:44,415
WHERE WE
GO INTO THIS WEEK'S NEWS AND GET
A LITTLE DEEPER.

834
01:00:44,415 --> 01:00:45,545
I'M MICHELLE DIXON.

835
01:00:45,545 --> 01:00:48,281
WITH ME FROM "THE GUARDIAN,"
CHRISTOPHER WILKINS.

836
01:00:48,281 --> 01:00:50,430
FROM "THE ATLANTIC," JACKIE
DONNELLY.

837
01:00:50,430 --> 01:00:52,935
AND CALVIN EMMANUEL FROM "THE
CHICAGO TRIBUNE."

838
01:00:52,935 --> 01:00:54,403
>> GREAT TO BE WITH YOU,
MICHELLE.

839
01:00:54,403 --> 01:00:58,359
>> WELL, LET'S START IN
MINNEAPOLIS WHERE I.C.E.
CONTINUES TO RAID HOMES AND
BUSINESSES

840
01:00:58,359 --> 01:01:00,597
IN WHAT SOME PEOPLE
ARE CALLING AN OCCUPATION.

841
01:01:00,597 --> 01:01:02,450
CHRISTOPHER, YOUR TAKE ON THIS?

842
01:01:02,450 --> 01:01:06,888
>> MICHELLE, THE FIRST WORD THAT
COMES TO MIND IS UNPRECEDENTED.

843
01:01:06,888 --> 01:01:10,219
I MEAN, YOU'VE GOT FEDERAL
OFFICERS ROAMING THE STREETS

844
01:01:10,219 --> 01:01:14,436
JUST PULLING PEOPLE OUT OF THEIR
CARS BASED ON HOW THEY LOOK.

845
01:01:14,436 --> 01:01:18,623
I MEAN, THIS JUST DOESN'T HAPPEN
IN AMERICA.

846
01:01:22,853 --> 01:01:27,799
>> YEAH, WELL -- I MEAN -- I
KNOW IT HAPPENS WITH SOME
POLICE.

847
01:01:27,799 --> 01:01:30,494
THERE ARE CERTAINLY BAD COPS OUT
THERE, OF COURSE.

848
01:01:30,494 --> 01:01:35,582
BUT THIS IS AN ENTIRE FEDERAL
FORCE WEAPONIZED

849
01:01:35,582 --> 01:01:37,769
AGAINST THE
PEOPLE IT'S SUPPOSED TO PROTECT.

850
01:01:37,769 --> 01:01:40,137
IT'S INSANE.

851
01:01:43,410 --> 01:01:46,338
>> OKAY, RIGHT, SURE.
OKAY.

852
01:01:46,338 --> 01:01:49,470
BUT THE DIFFERENCE HERE IS THESE OFFICERS

853
01:01:49,470 --> 01:01:53,125
ARE MARCHING THROUGH
NEIGHBORHOODS
WITH THE EXPRESS MISSION

854
01:01:53,125 --> 01:01:56,969
OF JUST STIRRING THINGS
UP SO THEY CAN VIOLENTLY ARREST
PEOPLE.

855
01:01:56,969 --> 01:01:59,221
THAT'S NEW.

856
01:02:05,442 --> 01:02:09,424
>> OKAY, I MEAN -- YOU GUYS KNOW
WHAT I MEAN, THOUGH.

857
01:02:09,424 --> 01:02:11,705
CAN SOMEONE ELSE GO, PLEASE?

858
01:02:11,705 --> 01:02:13,499
>> VERY WELL.

859
01:02:13,499 --> 01:02:17,593
JACKIE, ON SUNDAY, ANTI-I.C.E.
PROTESTERS INTERRUPTED A CHURCH
SERVICE.

860
01:02:17,593 --> 01:02:20,574
NOW THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION HAS
ARRESTED TWO PEOPLE.

861
01:02:20,574 --> 01:02:22,869
ARE TACTICS LIKE THIS HURTING
THEIR CAUSE?

862
01:02:22,869 --> 01:02:26,462
>> I MEAN, IT'S UNLIKELY.
THIS WAS AN ISOLATED INCIDENT

863
01:02:26,462 --> 01:02:28,933
AND PROBABLY WON'T SLOW THE
MOVEMENT DOWN.

864
01:02:28,933 --> 01:02:33,869
I MEAN, LET'S BE HONEST.
NOT A LOT OF DEMOCRATS GO TO
CHURCH ANYMORE.

865
01:02:35,600 --> 01:02:38,294
>> I MEAN, OF COURSE DEMOCRATS
GO TO CHURCH.

866
01:02:38,294 --> 01:02:42,625
BUT IT'S A COMMUNITY THING.
IT'S NOT JUST ALL ABOUT JESUS.

867
01:02:44,952 --> 01:02:47,786
>> SHE SAID CHURCH AIN'T ABOUT
JESUS?

868
01:02:47,786 --> 01:02:50,286
>> COLOR ME SURPRISED.

869
01:02:50,286 --> 01:02:52,536
>> I KNOW IT'S ABOUT JESUS,

870
01:02:52,536 --> 01:02:57,412
IT'S JUST LEFT-LEANING CHURCHES ARE
NOT, YOU KNOW, SO POLITICAL.

871
01:02:59,712 --> 01:03:02,079
>> OKAY, STOP.
THAT'S NOT AT ALL WHAT I MEANT.

872
01:03:02,079 --> 01:03:07,073
>> RIGHT, I MEAN, JACKIE KNOWS
VERY WELL THAT ALL KINDS OF
PEOPLE ATTEND CHURCH.

873
01:03:07,073 --> 01:03:10,472
>> IF IT MATTERS, I'VE STARTED
GOING AGAIN.

874
01:03:10,472 --> 01:03:12,046
>> REALLY?
GOOD FOR YOU.

875
01:03:12,046 --> 01:03:16,173
>> YEAH.
EVER SINCE THEY CHANGED IT SO
YOU DON'T HAVE TO DRESS UP
ANYMORE.

876
01:03:16,173 --> 01:03:21,068
I MEAN, HOW NICE IS IT TO WEAR
JEANS TO CHURCH, RIGHT?

877
01:03:24,714 --> 01:03:27,319
>> LET'S MOVE ON TO
INTERNATIONAL NEWS.

878
01:03:27,319 --> 01:03:30,588
THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION
CONTINUES TO TRY AND TAKE OVER GREENLAND

879
01:03:30,588 --> 01:03:32,599
DESPITE FORCED
OPPOSITION FROM EUROPE.

880
01:03:32,599 --> 01:03:34,924
JACKIE, HOW DOES THIS END?

881
01:03:34,924 --> 01:03:37,788
>> I DON'T KNOW, BUT I DO KNOW,

882
01:03:37,788 --> 01:03:40,448
IT'S LIKELY A VIOLATION OF
INTERNATIONAL LAW.

883
01:03:40,448 --> 01:03:45,307
YOU CAN'T JUST POINT TO A
COUNTRY AND SAY, HEY, THAT'S
OURS NOW!

WHO'S MAKING NOISES?

888
01:04:03,112 --> 01:04:04,619
>> I'M SORRY, I DON'T HEAR A
PEEP.

889
01:04:04,619 --> 01:04:07,981
>> YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY MAKING
NOISES, AND IT'S DISTRACTING.

890
01:04:07,981 --> 01:04:11,204
CAN I AT LEAST GET THROUGH MY
POINT WITHOUT THE NOISES?

891
01:04:11,204 --> 01:04:15,308
>> ABSOLUTELY.
GO AHEAD, AND I PROMISE WE WON'T
SAY A WORD.

892
01:04:15,308 --> 01:04:18,442
>> THANK YOU.
ALL I'M SAYING IS THAT DONALD TRUMP

893

SOMEONE ELSE'S LAND THROUGH
GREED AND AGGRESSION,

894
01:04:21,846 --> 01:04:23,456
BUT THE
REST OF US DON'T.

895

WE'RE AMERICA.
THIS IS NOT WHO WE ARE.

896

WOMAN WHOSE JOB WAS REPLACED BY
A.I.

901
01:04:47,536 --> 01:04:51,803

>> DON'T BE NERVOUS, THEY'RE
GOING TO LOVE YOU.

907
01:05:21,406 --> 01:05:24,650
>> I DON'T KNOW, MAN.
I JUST REALLY WANT TO MAKE A
GOOD IMPRESSION.

908
01:05:24,650 --> 01:05:27,724
>> YOU WILL.
YOU'RE GOING TO DO GREAT.
THEY'RE GOING TO LOVE YOU.

909
01:05:27,724 --> 01:05:30,688
JUST ONE THING.
MY DAD'S FROM THE SOUTH.

910
01:05:30,688 --> 01:05:33,065
>> THE SOUTH?
>> YEAH, SO HE'S PRETTY
OLD-FASHIONED.

911
01:05:33,065 --> 01:05:34,854
SO JUST DON'T TALK POLITICS,
OKAY?

912
01:05:34,854 --> 01:05:36,327
>> NO POLITICS.

01:05:40,605 --> 01:05:43,873
>> AVA, THERE'S MY LITTLE GIRL.

916
01:05:43,873 --> 01:05:47,474
>> AND THIS MUST BE THE GUY THAT
WE'VE HEARD SO MUCH ABOUT.

917
01:05:47,474 --> 01:05:49,648
I HOPE THE DRIVE WASN'T TOO BAD.
>> IT WASN'T.

918
01:05:49,648 --> 01:05:52,532
>> Y'ALL MADE GREAT TIME COMING
UP HERE.

924
01:06:14,936 --> 01:06:18,267
>> BUT WHAT IF I TOLD YOU
BREAKING UP WAS MY GOAL HERE?

925
01:06:18,267 --> 01:06:21,149
RELATIONSHIPS ARE HARD, AND MEN
ARE COWARDS.

926
01:06:21,149 --> 01:06:25,219
SOMETIMES YOU WANT TO BREAK UP
BUT IT WOULD BE EASIER IF SHE
BROKE UP WITH YOU.

927
01:06:25,219 --> 01:06:29,172
I'LL BE TEACHING YOU HOW TO BLOW
