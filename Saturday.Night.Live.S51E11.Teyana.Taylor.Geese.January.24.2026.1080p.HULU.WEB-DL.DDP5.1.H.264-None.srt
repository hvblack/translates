00:00:19,541 --> 00:00:21,256
>> THANK YOU SO MUCH.

6
00:00:21,256 --> 00:00:24,446
IT TRULY IS AN HONOR TO BE HERE
HOSTING THE TRUMPS.

7
00:00:24,446 --> 00:00:28,784
AFTER THAT LADY WHOSE NAME I
ALREADY FORGET GAVE ME HER NOBEL
PRIZE,

8
00:00:28,784 --> 00:00:31,181
I THOUGHT, I NEED MORE
AWARDS.

9
00:00:31,181 --> 00:00:35,197
AND AFTER ALL WHAT OUR LITTLE
FREAKS AND PSYCHOS IN I.C.E. HAVE BEEN DOING,

10
00:00:35,197 --> 00:00:36,715
I NEED MORE
DISTRACTIONS.

11
00:00:36,715 --> 00:00:39,890
LOOK,
EVERYTHING'S GOING TO CHINA.

12
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:42,233
WHAT A CROWD WE HAVE TONIGHT.

13
00:00:42,233 --> 00:00:44,711
SO MANY AWFUL, TERRIBLE PEOPLE
IN THE HOUSE.

14
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:47,766
I'D LIKE TO GET A ROUND OF
APPLAUSE GOING FOR THE NOMINEES,

15
00:00:47,766 --> 00:00:49,431
BUT MY DOCTORS SAY IF I CLAP

16
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:52,873
BOTH MY DEAD PURPLE HANDS WILL
EXPLODE WITH BLOOD.

17
00:00:52,873 --> 00:00:54,921
PROBABLY NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT.

18
00:00:54,921 --> 00:01:00,245
DOCTORS SAY I COULD LIVE TO BE
120, OR CURRENT AGE.

19
00:01:00,245 --> 00:01:02,469
YOU KNOW, THIS IS SUCH A SPECIAL
NIGHT.

20
00:01:02,469 --> 00:01:04,900
EVERYONE WANTS TO GO HOME WITH A
TRUMP.

21
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:08,247
EXCEPT, OF COURSE, MELANIA.

22
00:01:08,247 --> 00:01:09,454
HILARIOUS.

>> THIS IS DONALD TRUMP'S FIRST
TRUMP AWARD,

41
00:02:18,042 --> 00:02:22,637
EVEN THOUGH HE
COULD HAVE EARNED HUNDREDS OF

IT.

42
00:02:22,637 --> 00:02:26,466
>> WOW, WOW, THIS FEELS
INCREDIBLE.

43
00:02:26,561 --> 00:02:29,071
I LOVE ME, I REALLY LOVE ME.

I HAVE SO FEW PEOPLE TO THANK.
MYSELF, AND OF COURSE, THE BIG MAN UPSTAIRS,

WHICH IS WHAT I
CALL MY BRAIN TUMOR, YOW!

46
00:02:36,958 --> 00:02:40,894
IF I COULD BE SERIOUS FOR A

47
00:02:40,894 --> 00:02:44,154
GOING ON IN OUR

NO, NOT ALL LAUGHS.

94

AND I'M SO HONORED TO BE HOSTING
SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE!

115
00:09:48,924 --> 00:09:52,781
NOW, I'M A HARLEM GIRL, AND I
LOVE NEW YORK.

116
00:09:52,781 --> 00:09:54,084
BUT IT'S FREEZING OUT HERE.

117
00:09:54,084 --> 00:09:58,314
THAT'S WHY I HAD TO GET A SPOT
IN MIAMI BECAUSE THE BITCH WAS
COLD.

118
00:09:58,314 --> 00:10:01,460
NO WONDER WHY US NEW YORKERS, WE
SO AGITATED,

119
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:03,460
 BECAUSE WE COLD.

120
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:06,883
THIS WEEK HAS BEEN VERY INSANE.

121
00:10:06,883 --> 00:10:11,264
I WAS NOMINATED FOR AN OSCAR FOR
ONE BATTLE AFTER ANOTHER.

122
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:16,772
IT IS A DREAM COME TRUE.

123
00:10:16,772 --> 00:10:19,833
I FOUND OUT THE WAY EVERY LITTLE
GIRL WANTS TO FIND OUT.

124
00:10:19,833 --> 00:10:23,694
GET FITTED FOR A BALL CAP NEXT
TO MIKEY DAY.

125
00:10:23,694 --> 00:10:28,718
ALL OF THIS IS KIND OF
OVERWHELMING BECAUSE I AM A
REALLY SHY PERSON, BELIEVE IT OR NOT, 

126
00:10:28,718 --> 00:10:31,166
WHO DOES NOT LIKE A LOT OF
ATTENTION.

127
00:10:31,166 --> 00:10:35,439
FOR EXAMPLE, HERE'S ME AT MY
16th BIRTHDAY PARTY.

128
00:10:44,035 --> 00:10:46,783
YEAH, YEAH.

129
00:10:48,302 --> 00:10:52,409
YES, I WAS ON MTV'S "MY SUPER
SWEET 16."

130
00:10:52,409 --> 00:10:56,371
I'VE HAD THE CHANCE TO DO SO
MANY THINGS IN MY LIFE.

131
00:10:56,371 --> 00:10:59,912
FROM SINGING TO DANCING TO
ACTING TO DIRECTING.

132
00:10:59,912 --> 00:11:04,500
AND YES, I AM CURRENTLY IN
CULINARY SCHOOL, CHEFFING IT UP,

133
00:11:06,513 --> 00:11:11,458
HELL, I RANDOMLY WON "MAD SING
IR"DRESSED AS A FIREFLY, FOR
REAL.

134
00:11:11,458 --> 00:11:14,354
ME, I CONSIDER MYSELF A GLADE
PLUG-IN.

135
00:11:14,354 --> 00:11:19,074
WHY ONLY PLUG ME IN THE BATHROOM
WHEN I CAN MAKE THE WHOLE
BUILDING SMELL GOOD?

136
00:11:19,074 --> 00:11:22,952
ALSO, I AM A MOM.
PEOPLE ASK WHEN I SLEEP.

137
00:11:22,952 --> 00:11:28,342
DON'T WORRY, I GET A FULL EIGHT
HOURS A WEEK.

138
00:11:28,342 --> 00:11:31,229
BOTH MY PREGNANCIES WERE VERY,
VERY PEACEFUL.

139
00:11:31,229 --> 00:11:33,721
I DID ALL THE THINGS I WAS
SUPPOSED TO DO.

140
00:11:33,721 --> 00:11:37,364
I WAS GOING TO YOGA, TAKING
VITAMINS AVOIDING RAW FISH.

141
00:11:37,364 --> 00:11:40,252
I THINK WE HAVE A VIDEO OF ME
PREGNANT RIGHT HERE.

142
00:11:44,485 --> 00:11:46,699
SEE

143
00:11:47,993 --> 00:11:52,220
YES.
SO WHOLESOME, SO CALM.

144
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:54,344
MAN, I REALLY, REALLY LOVE MY
KIDS SO MUCH.

145
00:11:54,344 --> 00:11:56,382
I BRING THEM EVERYWHERE WITH ME.
FRONT

146
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:59,039
BUT WHEN I WAS GIVING MY SPEECH
AT THE GOLDEN GLOBES, 

147
00:11:59,039 --> 00:12:02,547
I LOOKED
UP TO SEE MY BABIES, I WANTED TO
SEE THEY FACES, YOU KNOW?

148
00:12:02,547 --> 00:12:05,235
JUST TO SEE THAT THEY WERE
SCROLLING ON THEIR PHONES.

149
00:12:05,235 --> 00:12:09,283
SO I'M LIKE, THIS IS SO
AMAZING -- GET OFF THEM PHONES!

>> I DON'T WANT YOU TO MEET HIM.

615
00:28:14,443 --> 00:28:17,611
>> WHY NOT?

616
00:28:17,613 --> 00:28:18,512

617
00:28:18,914 --> 00:28:20,514

628
00:29:03,758 --> 00:29:07,861
I'M JUST REALIZING YOU ACTUALLY

01:00:51,899 --> 01:00:52,431
I'M MICHELLE DIXON.

1322
01:00:52,433 --> 01:00:53,131
WITH ME FROM "THE GUARDIAN,"

1323
01:00:53,133 --> 01:00:53,665
CHRISTOPHER WILKINS.

1324
01:00:53,667 --> 01:00:54,666
FROM "THE ATLANTIC," JACKIE

1325
01:00:54,668 --> 01:00:55,901
DONNELLY.

1326
01:00:55,903 --> 01:00:56,601
AND CALVIN EMMANUEL FROM "THE

1327
01:00:56,603 --> 01:00:58,737
CHICAGO TRIBUNE."

1328
01:00:58,739 --> 01:01:00,338
>> GREAT TO BE WITH YOU,

1329
01:01:00,340 --> 01:01:00,705
MICHELLE.

1330
01:01:00,707 --> 01:01:01,673
>> WELL, LET'S START IN

1331
01:01:01,675 --> 01:01:03,041
MINNEAPOLIS WHERE I.C.E.

1332
01:01:03,043 --> 01:01:04,709
CONTINUES TO RAID HOMES AND

1333
01:01:04,711 --> 01:01:06,478
BUSINESSES IN WHAT SOME PEOPLE

1334
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:07,646
ARE CALLING AN OCCUPATION.

1335
01:01:07,648 --> 01:01:08,914
CHRISTOPHER, YOUR TAKE ON THIS?

1336
01:01:08,916 --> 01:01:11,016
>> MICHELLE, THE FIRST WORD THAT

1337
01:01:11,018 --> 01:01:12,918
COMES TO MIND IS UNPRECEDENTED.

1338
01:01:12,920 --> 01:01:14,886
I MEAN, YOU'VE GOT FEDERAL

1339
01:01:14,888 --> 01:01:16,488
OFFICERS ROAMING THE STREETS

1340
01:01:16,490 --> 01:01:17,989
JUST PULLING PEOPLE OUT OF THEIR

1341
01:01:17,991 --> 01:01:20,358
CARS BASED ON HOW THEY LOOK.

1342
01:01:20,360 --> 01:01:21,326
I MEAN, THIS JUST DOESN'T HAPPEN

1343
01:01:21,328 --> 01:01:23,962
IN AMERICA.

1344
01:01:23,964 --> 01:01:24,296
>> HM.

1345
01:01:24,298 --> 01:01:24,796
>> HM.

1346
01:01:28,602 --> 01:01:31,303
>> YEAH, WELL -- I MEAN -- I

1347
01:01:31,305 --> 01:01:33,371
KNOW IT HAPPENS WITH SOME

1348
01:01:33,373 --> 01:01:33,705
POLICE.

1349
01:01:33,707 --> 01:01:35,707
THERE ARE CERTAINLY BAD COPS OUT

1350
01:01:35,709 --> 01:01:37,175
THERE, OF COURSE.

1351
01:01:37,177 --> 01:01:40,378
BUT THIS IS AN ENTIRE FEDERAL

1352
01:01:40,380 --> 01:01:42,147
FORCE WEAPONIZED AGAINST THE

1353
01:01:42,149 --> 01:01:43,081
PEOPLE IT'S SUPPOSED TO PROTECT.

1354
01:01:43,083 --> 01:01:45,417
IT'S INSANE.

1355
01:01:45,419 --> 01:01:45,750
>> HM.

1356
01:01:45,752 --> 01:01:49,654
>> HM.

1357
01:01:49,656 --> 01:01:50,222
>> OKAY, RIGHT, SURE.

1358
01:01:50,224 --> 01:01:52,858
OKAY.

1359
01:01:52,860 --> 01:01:55,327
BUT THE DIFFERENCE HERE IS THESE

1360
01:01:55,329 --> 01:01:57,128
OFFICERS ARE MARCHING THROUGH

1361
01:01:57,130 --> 01:01:58,997
NEIGHBORHOODS WITH THE EXPRESS

1362
01:01:58,999 --> 01:02:00,732
MISSION OF JUST STIRRING THINGS

1363
01:02:00,734 --> 01:02:01,500
UP SO THEY CAN VIOLENTLY ARREST

1364
01:02:01,502 --> 01:02:02,601
PEOPLE.

1365
01:02:02,603 --> 01:02:05,237
THAT'S NEW.

1366
01:02:05,239 --> 01:02:05,570
>> HM.

1367
01:02:05,572 --> 01:02:12,310
>> HM.

1368
01:02:12,312 --> 01:02:15,347
>> OKAY, I MEAN -- YOU GUYS KNOW

1369
01:02:15,349 --> 01:02:16,748
WHAT I MEAN, THOUGH.

1370
01:02:16,750 --> 01:02:17,449
CAN SOMEONE ELSE GO, PLEASE?

1371
01:02:17,851 --> 01:02:19,918
>> VERY WELL.

1372
01:02:19,920 --> 01:02:22,654
JACKIE, ON SUNDAY, ANTI-I.C.E.

1373
01:02:22,656 --> 01:02:23,788
PROTESTERS INTERRUPTED A CHURCH

1374
01:02:23,790 --> 01:02:24,122
SERVICE.

1375
01:02:24,124 --> 01:02:26,157
NOW THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION HAS

1376
01:02:26,159 --> 01:02:27,926
ARRESTED TWO PEOPLE.

1377
01:02:27,928 --> 01:02:29,427
ARE TACTICS LIKE THIS HURTING

1378
01:02:29,429 --> 01:02:29,928
THEIR CAUSE?

1379
01:02:29,930 --> 01:02:31,830
>> I MEAN, IT'S UNLIKELY.

1380
01:02:31,832 --> 01:02:33,431
THIS WAS AN ISOLATED INCIDENT

1381
01:02:33,433 --> 01:02:34,566
AND PROBABLY WON'T SLOW THE

1382
01:02:34,568 --> 01:02:35,300
MOVEMENT DOWN.

1383
01:02:35,302 --> 01:02:36,234
I MEAN, LET'S BE HONEST.

1384
01:02:36,236 --> 01:02:38,036
NOT A LOT OF DEMOCRATS GO TO

1385
01:02:38,038 --> 01:02:38,503
CHURCH ANYMORE.

1386
01:02:38,505 --> 01:02:38,837
>> HM.

1387
01:02:38,839 --> 01:02:41,907
>> HM.

1388
01:02:41,909 --> 01:02:43,275
>> I MEAN, OF COURSE DEMOCRATS

1389
01:02:43,277 --> 01:02:44,109
GO TO CHURCH.

1390
01:02:44,111 --> 01:02:45,243
BUT IT'S A COMMUNITY THING.

1391
01:02:45,245 --> 01:02:48,246
IT'S NOT JUST ALL ABOUT JESUS.

1392
01:02:48,248 --> 01:02:48,813
>> HM!

1393
01:02:48,815 --> 01:02:57,188
>> HM!

1394
01:02:58,425 --> 01:02:59,157
>> SHE SAID CHURCH AIN'T ABOUT

1395
01:02:59,159 --> 01:02:59,457
JESUS?

1396
01:02:59,459 --> 01:03:00,058
>> COLOR ME SURPRISED.

1397
01:03:00,060 --> 01:03:00,825
>> I KNOW IT'S ABOUT JESUS, IT'S

1398
01:03:00,827 --> 01:03:01,593
JUST LEFT-LEANING CHURCHES ARE

1399
01:03:01,595 --> 01:03:02,327
NOT, YOU KNOW, SO POLITICAL.

1400
01:03:02,329 --> 01:03:02,627
>> HM!

1401
01:03:02,629 --> 01:03:05,297
>> HM!

1402
01:03:05,299 --> 01:03:06,565
>> OKAY, STOP.

1403
01:03:06,567 --> 01:03:07,999
THAT'S NOT AT ALL WHAT I MEANT.

1404
01:03:08,001 --> 01:03:10,135
>> RIGHT, I MEAN, JACKIE KNOWS

1405
01:03:10,137 --> 01:03:12,137
VERY WELL THAT ALL KINDS OF

1406
01:03:12,139 --> 01:03:12,938
PEOPLE ATTEND CHURCH.

1407
01:03:12,940 --> 01:03:13,471
>> YES.

1408
01:03:13,473 --> 01:03:15,674
>> IF IT MATTERS, I'VE STARTED

1409
01:03:15,676 --> 01:03:16,708
GOING AGAIN.

1410
01:03:16,710 --> 01:03:17,242
>> REALLY?

1411
01:03:17,244 --> 01:03:18,043
GOOD FOR YOU.

1412
01:03:18,045 --> 01:03:18,944
>> YEAH.

1413
01:03:18,946 --> 01:03:20,345
EVER SINCE THEY CHANGED IT SO

1414
01:03:20,347 --> 01:03:22,047
YOU DON'T HAVE TO DRESS UP

1415
01:03:22,049 --> 01:03:22,480
ANYMORE.

1416
01:03:22,482 --> 01:03:23,815
I MEAN, HOW NICE IS IT TO WEAR

1417
01:03:23,817 --> 01:03:26,685
JEANS TO CHURCH, RIGHT?

1418
01:03:26,687 --> 01:03:26,985
>> HM!

1419
01:03:26,987 --> 01:03:31,623
>> HM!

1420
01:03:31,625 --> 01:03:32,757
>> LET'S MOVE ON TO

1421
01:03:32,759 --> 01:03:33,525
INTERNATIONAL NEWS.

1422
01:03:33,527 --> 01:03:34,526
THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION

1423
01:03:34,528 --> 01:03:38,563
CONTINUES TO TRY AND TAKE OVER

1424
01:03:38,565 --> 01:03:40,131
GREENLAND DESPITE FORCED

1425
01:03:40,133 --> 01:03:42,033
OPPOSITION FROM EUROPE.

1426
01:03:42,035 --> 01:03:42,934
JACKIE, HOW DOES THIS END?

1427
01:03:42,936 --> 01:03:45,370
>> I DON'T KNOW, BUT I DO KNOW,

1428
01:03:45,372 --> 01:03:47,105
IT'S LIKELY A VIOLATION OF

1429
01:03:47,107 --> 01:03:48,239
INTERNATIONAL LAW.

1430
01:03:48,241 --> 01:03:49,808
YOU CAN'T JUST POINT TO A

1431
01:03:49,810 --> 01:03:52,043
COUNTRY AND SAY, HEY, THAT'S

1432
01:03:52,045 --> 01:03:52,911
OURS NOW!

1433
01:03:52,913 --> 01:03:53,612
>> HM.

1434
01:03:53,614 --> 01:03:53,945
>> HM.

1435
01:03:53,947 --> 01:03:54,679
>> I MEAN, SOME COUNTRIES DO

1436
01:03:54,681 --> 01:03:56,982
THAT, BUT NOT AMERICA.

1437
01:03:56,984 --> 01:03:57,282
>> HM!

1438
01:03:57,284 --> 01:04:01,686
>> HM!

1439
01:04:01,688 --> 01:04:02,087
>> REALLY.

1440
01:04:02,089 --> 01:04:03,955
>> HAS SHE MET AMERICA?

1441
01:04:03,957 --> 01:04:05,090
>> OKAY, ENOUGH.

1442
01:04:05,092 --> 01:04:07,058
WILL YOU GUYS PLEASE STOP MAKING

1443
01:04:07,060 --> 01:04:07,759
THE NOISES?

1444
01:04:07,761 --> 01:04:08,493
>> NOISES?

1445
01:04:08,495 --> 01:04:09,160
WHO'S MAKING NOISES?

1446
01:04:09,162 --> 01:04:11,529
>> I'M SORRY, I DON'T HEAR A

1447
01:04:11,531 --> 01:04:11,830
PEEP.

1448
01:04:11,832 --> 01:04:13,498
>> YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY MAKING

1449
01:04:13,500 --> 01:04:14,532
NOISES, AND IT'S DISTRACTING.

1450
01:04:14,534 --> 01:04:16,034
CAN I AT LEAST GET THROUGH MY

1451
01:04:16,036 --> 01:04:16,668
POINT WITHOUT THE NOISES?

1452
01:04:16,670 --> 01:04:18,203
>> ABSOLUTELY.

1453
01:04:18,205 --> 01:04:19,571
GO AHEAD, AND I PROMISE WE WON'T

1454
01:04:19,573 --> 01:04:20,238
SAY A WORD.

1455
01:04:20,240 --> 01:04:21,906
>> NOT A WORD.

1456
01:04:21,908 --> 01:04:22,574
>> THANK YOU.

1457
01:04:22,576 --> 01:04:23,942
ALL I'M SAYING IS THAT DONALD

1458
01:04:23,944 --> 01:04:25,744
TRUMP MAY WANT TO JUST TAKE

1459
01:04:25,746 --> 01:04:26,611
SOMEONE ELSE'S LAND THROUGH

1460
01:04:26,613 --> 01:04:28,046
GREED AND AGGRESSION, BUT THE

1461
01:04:28,048 --> 01:04:30,015
REST OF US DON'T.

1462
01:04:30,017 --> 01:04:30,749
WE'RE AMERICA.

1463
01:04:30,751 --> 01:04:31,349
THIS IS NOT WHO WE ARE.

1464
01:04:31,351 --> 01:04:35,620
>> HM!

1465
01:04:36,023 --> 01:04:36,554
>> OKAY.

1466
01:04:36,556 --> 01:04:37,255
I THINK THAT GUY JUST MADE A

1467
01:04:37,257 --> 01:04:39,357
NOISE.

1468
01:04:39,359 --> 01:04:42,927
>> SORRY, JACKIE, I'LL ASK OUR

1469
01:04:42,929 --> 01:04:44,696
CAMERAMAN DARIUS NOT TO

1470
01:04:44,698 --> 01:04:45,096
INTERRUPT.

1471
01:04:45,098 --> 01:04:46,931
>> I'M SORRY, AIN'T KNOW Y'ALL

1472
01:04:46,933 --> 01:04:47,866
WAS DOING THAT.

1473
01:04:47,868 --> 01:04:51,803
>> LET'S TAKE A BREAK TO THANK

1474
01:04:51,805 --> 01:04:52,604
OUR CORE BROUGHT SPONSORS.

1475
01:04:52,606 --> 01:04:55,607
WHEN WE RETURN, WE'LL TALK TO A

1476
01:04:55,609 --> 01:04:59,911
WOMAN WHOSE JOB WAS REPLACED BY

1477
01:04:59,913 --> 01:05:00,445
A.I.

1478
01:05:00,447 --> 01:05:03,682
NOT A COMPUTER, THE FORMER NBA

1479
01:05:03,684 --> 01:05:12,757
PLAYER ALLEN IVERSON.

1480
01:05:19,331 --> 01:05:23,334
CHARGED AS MEETING THE PARENTS.

1481
01:05:23,336 --> 01:05:24,102
>> GOD, I'M JUST SO NERVOUS.

1482
01:05:24,104 --> 01:05:24,836
>> DON'T BE NERVOUS, THEY'RE

1483
01:05:24,838 --> 01:05:26,104
GOING TO LOVE YOU.

1484
01:05:26,106 --> 01:05:26,871
>> I DON'T KNOW, MAN.

1485
01:05:26,873 --> 01:05:27,839
I JUST REALLY WANT TO MAKE A

1486
01:05:27,841 --> 01:05:28,606
GOOD IMPRESSION.

1487
01:05:28,608 --> 01:05:29,574
>> YOU WILL.

1488
01:05:29,576 --> 01:05:30,842
YOU'RE GOING TO DO GREAT.

1489
01:05:30,844 --> 01:05:32,110
THEY'RE GOING TO LOVE YOU.

1490
01:05:32,112 --> 01:05:33,078
JUST ONE THING.

1491
01:05:33,080 --> 01:05:34,379
MY DAD'S FROM THE SOUTH.

1492
01:05:34,381 --> 01:05:35,847
>> THE SOUTH?

1493
01:05:35,849 --> 01:05:36,848
>> YEAH, SO HE'S PRETTY

1494
01:05:36,850 --> 01:05:37,849
OLD-FASHIONED.

1495
01:05:37,851 --> 01:05:38,583
SO JUST DON'T TALK POLITICS,

1496
01:05:38,585 --> 01:05:39,117
OKAY?

1497
01:05:39,119 --> 01:05:39,851
>> NO POLITICS.

1498
01:05:39,853 --> 01:05:40,618
>> NO POLITICS.

1499
01:05:40,620 --> 01:05:42,587
>> I CAN DO THAT.

1500
01:05:42,589 --> 01:05:45,356
>> MOM, DAD, WE'RE HOME!

1501
01:05:45,358 --> 01:05:48,793
>> OH!

1502
01:05:48,795 --> 01:05:50,962
>> AVA, THERE'S MY LITTLE GIRL.

1503
01:05:50,964 --> 01:05:51,730
>> AND THIS MUST BE THE GUY THAT

1504
01:05:51,732 --> 01:05:54,799
WE'VE HEARD SO MUCH ABOUT.

1505
01:05:54,801 --> 01:05:56,234
I HOPE THE DRIVE WASN'T TOO BAD.

1506
01:05:56,236 --> 01:05:56,968
>> IT WASN'T.

1507
01:05:56,970 --> 01:05:57,702
>> Y'ALL MADE GREAT TIME COMING

1508
01:05:57,704 --> 01:05:58,236
UP HERE.

1509
01:05:58,238 --> 01:05:58,970
Y'ALL TAKE 87?

1510
01:05:58,972 --> 01:06:01,005
>> Y'ALL TAKE 87?

1511
01:06:08,715 --> 01:06:16,387
>> WELL, LET'S JUST MOVE ON.

1512
01:06:16,389 --> 01:06:20,892
>> FRESHERING A JAB RABBIT --

1513
01:06:20,894 --> 01:06:23,862
THAT'S LITERALLY HOW YOU TALK.

1514
01:06:23,864 --> 01:06:24,596
>> WE HAVE TO BREAK UP NOW.

1515
01:06:24,598 --> 01:06:25,363
>> BUT WHAT IF I TOLD YOU

1516
01:06:25,365 --> 01:06:26,097
BREAKING UP WAS MY GOAL HERE?

1517
01:06:26,099 --> 01:06:26,865
RELATIONSHIPS ARE HARD, AND MEN

1518
01:06:26,867 --> 01:06:27,599
ARE COWARDS.

1519
01:06:27,601 --> 01:06:28,333
SOMETIMES YOU WANT TO BREAK UP

1520
01:06:28,335 --> 01:06:29,100
BUT IT WOULD BE EASIER IF SHE

1521
01:06:29,102 --> 01:06:30,368
BROKE UP WITH YOU.

1522
01:06:30,370 --> 01:06:31,870
I'LL BE TEACHING YOU HOW TO BLOW

1523
01:06:31,872 --> 01:06:32,604
IT SO BAD, YOUR RELATIONSHIP

1524
01:06:32,606 --> 01:06:33,838
EXPLODES.

1525

WITH METHODS FROM MY NEW BOOK,

1526
01:06:38,044 --> 01:06:40,478
"50 WAYS TO GET YOUR LOVER TO"

1527
01:06:40,480 --> 01:06:43,481
LEAVE YOU BECAUSE LEAVING YOUR

1528
01:06:43,483 --> 01:06:44,215
LOVER IS HARD BECAUSE YOU LOVE

1529
01:06:44,217 --> 01:06:46,785
YOUR LOVER SO WHY NOT GET YOUR

1530
01:06:46,787 --> 01:06:48,219
LOVER TO LEAVE NOW?

1531
01:06:48,221 --> 01:06:48,953
YOU WANT TO CAPITALIZE ON HIGHLY

1532
01:06:48,955 --> 01:06:49,754
CHARGED MOMENTS LIKE MEETING HER

1533
01:06:49,756 --> 01:06:50,221
PARENTS.

1534
01:06:50,223 --> 01:06:51,222
>> WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH

1535
01:06:51,224 --> 01:06:55,293
YOU?

1536
01:06:55,295 --> 01:06:57,028
>> OUT TO LUNCH, STILL AM NOT

1537
01:06:57,030 --> 01:06:57,328
FINE.

1538
01:06:58,231 --> 01:06:58,930
>> BUT ANOTHER HIGHLY CHARGED

1539
01:06:58,932 --> 01:06:59,564
MOMENT IS VALENTINE'S DAY.

1540
01:06:59,566 --> 01:07:00,265
>> BABE, YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO.

1541
01:07:00,267 --> 01:07:00,732
>> OH, I DID.

1542
01:07:00,734 --> 01:07:01,366
I JUST -- I SAW IT, AND I

1543
01:07:01,368 --> 01:07:02,967
IMMEDIATELY THOUGHT OF YOU.

1544
01:07:02,969 --> 01:07:06,237
>> 100 TAMPONS?

1545
01:07:06,239 --> 01:07:06,971
>> A VERY CHARGED MOMENT IS A

1546
01:07:06,973 --> 01:07:08,706
FAMILY FUNERAL.

1547
01:07:08,708 --> 01:07:10,008
IF YOU WANT TO END YOUR

1548
01:07:10,010 --> 01:07:10,708
RELATIONSHIP, TRY SHOWING UP

1549

1550
01:07:11,478 --> 01:07:14,212
LUMINEERS.

1551
01:07:19,886 --> 01:07:21,519
IF YOU'RE JUST STARTING THE DAY,

1552
01:07:21,521 --> 01:07:24,722
BLOWING IT CAN BE AS SIMPLE

1553
01:07:24,724 --> 01:07:25,456
AS WEARING SOMETHING THAT MAKES

1554
01:07:25,458 --> 01:07:25,924
YOU SEEM GROSS.

1555
01:07:25,926 --> 01:07:30,128
>> SHOULD WE DO A BOTTLE?

1556
01:07:30,130 --> 01:07:31,329
GOING TO HIT THE RESTROOM.

1557
01:07:31,331 --> 01:07:32,597
>> HERE'S ONE.

1558
01:07:32,599 --> 01:07:33,598
THE NEXT TIME SHE COMES TO YOU

1559
01:07:33,600 --> 01:07:35,333

A HARD PIVOT TO A SIMPLE

1570

01:08:09,469 --> 01:08:10,235
