00:00:19,541 --> 00:00:21,256
>> THANK YOU SO MUCH.

6
00:00:21,256 --> 00:00:24,446
IT TRULY IS AN HONOR TO BE HERE
HOSTING THE TRUMPS.

7
00:00:24,446 --> 00:00:28,784
AFTER THAT LADY WHOSE NAME I
ALREADY FORGET GAVE ME HER NOBEL
PRIZE,

8
00:00:28,784 --> 00:00:31,181
I THOUGHT, I NEED MORE
AWARDS.

9
00:00:31,181 --> 00:00:35,197
AND AFTER ALL WHAT OUR LITTLE
FREAKS AND PSYCHOS IN I.C.E. HAVE BEEN DOING,

10
00:00:35,197 --> 00:00:36,715
I NEED MORE
DISTRACTIONS.

11
00:00:36,715 --> 00:00:39,890
LOOK,
EVERYTHING'S GOING TO CHINA.

12
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:42,233
WHAT A CROWD WE HAVE TONIGHT.

13
00:00:42,233 --> 00:00:44,711
SO MANY AWFUL, TERRIBLE PEOPLE
IN THE HOUSE.

14
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:47,766
I'D LIKE TO GET A ROUND OF
APPLAUSE GOING FOR THE NOMINEES,

15
00:00:47,766 --> 00:00:49,431
BUT MY DOCTORS SAY IF I CLAP

16
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:52,873
BOTH MY DEAD PURPLE HANDS WILL
EXPLODE WITH BLOOD.

17
00:00:52,873 --> 00:00:54,921
PROBABLY NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT.

18
00:00:54,921 --> 00:01:00,245
DOCTORS SAY I COULD LIVE TO BE
120, OR CURRENT AGE.

19
00:01:00,245 --> 00:01:02,469
YOU KNOW, THIS IS SUCH A SPECIAL
NIGHT.

20
00:01:02,469 --> 00:01:04,900
EVERYONE WANTS TO GO HOME WITH A
TRUMP.

21
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:08,247
EXCEPT, OF COURSE, MELANIA.

22
00:01:08,247 --> 00:01:09,454

>> THIS IS DONALD TRUMP'S FIRST
TRUMP AWARD,

41
00:02:18,042 --> 00:02:22,637
EVEN THOUGH HE
COULD HAVE EARNED HUNDREDS OF

IT.

42
00:02:22,637 --> 00:02:26,466
>> WOW, WOW, THIS FEELS
INCREDIBLE.

43

I HAVE SO FEW PEOPLE TO THANK.
MYSELF, AND OF COURSE, THE BIG MAN UPSTAIRS,

WHICH IS WHAT I
CALL MY BRAIN TUMOR, YOW!

46
00:02:36,958 --> 00:02:40,894
IF I COULD BE SERIOUS FOR A

47
00:02:40,894 --> 00:02:44,154
GOING ON IN OUR

AND I'M SO HONORED TO BE HOSTING
SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE!

115
00:09:48,924 --> 00:09:52,781
NOW, I'M A HARLEM GIRL, AND I
LOVE NEW YORK.

116
00:09:52,781 --> 00:09:54,084
BUT IT'S FREEZING OUT HERE.

117
00:09:54,084 --> 00:09:58,314
THAT'S WHY I HAD TO GET A SPOT
IN MIAMI BECAUSE THE BITCH WAS
COLD.

118
00:09:58,314 --> 00:10:01,460
NO WONDER WHY US NEW YORKERS, WE
SO AGITATED,

119
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:03,460
BECAUSE WE COLD.

120
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:06,883
THIS WEEK HAS BEEN VERY INSANE.

121
00:10:06,883 --> 00:10:11,264
I WAS NOMINATED FOR AN OSCAR FOR
ONE BATTLE AFTER ANOTHER.

122
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:16,772
IT IS A DREAM COME TRUE.

123
00:10:16,772 --> 00:10:19,833
I FOUND OUT THE WAY EVERY LITTLE
GIRL WANTS TO FIND OUT.

124
00:10:19,833 --> 00:10:23,694
GET FITTED FOR A BALL CAP NEXT
TO MIKEY DAY.

125
00:10:23,694 --> 00:10:28,718
ALL OF THIS IS KIND OF
OVERWHELMING BECAUSE I AM A
REALLY SHY PERSON, BELIEVE IT OR NOT,

126
00:10:28,718 --> 00:10:31,166
WHO DOES NOT LIKE A LOT OF
ATTENTION.

127
00:10:31,166 --> 00:10:35,439
FOR EXAMPLE, HERE'S ME AT MY
16th BIRTHDAY PARTY.

128
00:10:44,035 --> 00:10:46,783
YEAH, YEAH.

129
00:10:48,302 --> 00:10:52,409
YES, I WAS ON MTV'S "MY SUPER
SWEET 16."

130
00:10:52,409 --> 00:10:56,371
I'VE HAD THE CHANCE TO DO SO
MANY THINGS IN MY LIFE.

131
00:10:56,371 --> 00:10:59,912
FROM SINGING TO DANCING TO
ACTING TO DIRECTING.

132
00:10:59,912 --> 00:11:04,500
AND YES, I AM CURRENTLY IN
CULINARY SCHOOL, CHEFFING IT UP,

133
00:11:06,513 --> 00:11:11,458
HELL, I RANDOMLY WON "MAD SING
IR"DRESSED AS A FIREFLY, FOR
REAL.

134
00:11:11,458 --> 00:11:14,354
ME, I CONSIDER MYSELF A GLADE
PLUG-IN.

135
00:11:14,354 --> 00:11:19,074
WHY ONLY PLUG ME IN THE BATHROOM
WHEN I CAN MAKE THE WHOLE
BUILDING SMELL GOOD?

136
00:11:19,074 --> 00:11:22,952
ALSO, I AM A MOM.
PEOPLE ASK WHEN I SLEEP.

137
00:11:22,952 --> 00:11:28,342
DON'T WORRY, I GET A FULL EIGHT
HOURS A WEEK.

138
00:11:28,342 --> 00:11:31,229
BOTH MY PREGNANCIES WERE VERY,
VERY PEACEFUL.

139
00:11:31,229 --> 00:11:33,721
I DID ALL THE THINGS I WAS
SUPPOSED TO DO.

140
00:11:33,721 --> 00:11:37,364
I WAS GOING TO YOGA, TAKING
VITAMINS AVOIDING RAW FISH.

141
00:11:37,364 --> 00:11:40,252
I THINK WE HAVE A VIDEO OF ME
PREGNANT RIGHT HERE.

142
00:11:44,485 --> 00:11:46,699
SEE

143
00:11:47,993 --> 00:11:52,220
YES.
SO WHOLESOME, SO CALM.

144
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:54,344
MAN, I REALLY, REALLY LOVE MY
KIDS SO MUCH.

145
00:11:54,344 --> 00:11:56,382
I BRING THEM EVERYWHERE WITH ME.
FRONT

146
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:59,039
BUT WHEN I WAS GIVING MY SPEECH
AT THE GOLDEN GLOBES,

147
00:11:59,039 --> 00:12:02,547
I LOOKED
UP TO SEE MY BABIES, I WANTED TO
SEE THEY FACES, YOU KNOW?

148
00:12:02,547 --> 00:12:05,235
JUST TO SEE THAT THEY WERE
SCROLLING ON THEIR PHONES.

149
00:12:05,235 --> 00:12:09,283
SO I'M LIKE, THIS IS SO
AMAZING -- GET OFF THEM PHONES!

150

THE PLANE AIN'T GOT NO WINGS.
THEY NEED TO PUT THEM ON.

199

>> THAT DOES NOT SEEM RIGHT.
>> IT IS NOT RIGHT.

203
00:15:37,795 --> 00:15:40,954

PEDIALYTE, AND THE GROUND CREW
SNAPPED THE WINGS ON.

00:20:29,017 --> 00:20:32,183
>> THE BRONCOS HAVE NOTHING TO
BE ASHAMED OF.

297
00:20:32,183 --> 00:20:35,677
THEY HAD A GREAT SEASON AND
SHOULDN'T HOLD BACK THEIR HEADS,
HOLD THEIR HEADS HIGH.

298
00:20:35,677 --> 00:20:38,315
I'M SURE THEY'LL AN TEAM TO
WATCH NEXT YEAR.

299
00:20:38,401 --> 00:20:40,558
>> LISA, THE GAME HASN'T STARTED
YET.

300
00:20:40,558 --> 00:20:42,795
THINK YOU'RE WRITING OFF THE
BRONCOS A LITTLE EARLY?

301
00:20:42,795 --> 00:20:44,892
>> I MEAN, COME ON.

302
00:20:44,892 --> 00:20:48,101
THEY AIN'T GOT NO QUARTERBACK.
LIKE, COME ON.

303
00:20:48,101 --> 00:20:51,589
>> LISA, DENVER IS A VERY
CAPABLE TEAM.
THEY COULD WIN.

304
00:20:51,589 --> 00:20:54,516
>> YEAH.
BUT LIKE -- COME ON.

305
00:20:54,516 --> 00:20:56,101
TROY, BACK TO YOU.

>> WELL.
DENVER WILL START BACKUP JARRETT
STIDHAM, WHO HASN'T PLAYED A
SNAP ALL YEAR.

307
00:21:00,755 --> 00:21:03,901
>> I LIKE THE GUY, I THINK HE
COULD SURPRISE US.

308
00:21:03,901 --> 00:21:07,773
>> SPEAKING OF SURPRISES, ONE
PART SUGAR AND ALL PART SPICE

309
00:21:07,773 --> 00:21:09,585
ON
AN ALL-NEW "QUEFS."

310
00:21:09,585 --> 00:21:13,845
THINGS ARE HEATING UP IN THE
KITCHEN.
FOR

311
00:21:13,845 --> 00:21:16,359
BUT IF BRIDGETTE HAS HER WAY,

312
00:21:16,359 --> 00:21:20,037
IT'S D-DAY.
THREE

313
00:21:20,037 --> 00:21:22,447
FEATURING MUSIC BY SUAVE.

314
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:24,701
IT'S "QUEFS, THAT PART."

315
00:21:24,701 --> 00:21:28,389
>> I THOUGHT SUAVE WAS JUST AN
ACTOR.

316
00:21:28,389 --> 00:21:30,489
>> THERE'S NO WAY YOU KNOW WHO
THAT IS.

317
00:21:30,489 --> 00:21:32,163
>> I DO NOT, JOE.

318
00:21:32,163 --> 00:21:35,680
>> NOW, I'M SEEING LISA HAS SOME
NEWS ON THE DENVER QUARTERBACK
SITUATION.

319
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:37,379

320
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:40,277

I DON'T KNOW WHERE HE IS BUT I
HAVE AN UPDATE FROM HIS FAN.

321
00:21:40,277 --> 00:21:44,077
SIR, WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

322
00:21:44,077 --> 00:21:46,535
>> WHO, NOW?

323
00:21:46,535 --> 00:21:48,772
I'M DENVER'S STARTING
QUARTERBACK TONIGHT.

324
00:21:48,772 --> 00:21:52,533
>> OKAY, WELL, CONGRATS ON A
GREAT SEASON, AND BETTER LUCK
NEXT YEAR.

325
00:21:52,533 --> 00:21:55,611
>> WAIT, HOLD ON, LISA.
WE'VE GOT A GREAT TEAM HERE.

326
00:21:55,611 --> 00:21:57,049
I THINK WE CAN WIN THIS THING.

327
00:21:57,049 --> 00:22:00,635
>> YEAH, BUT JARRETT -- COME ON.

328
00:22:00,635 --> 00:22:02,955
BACK TO YOU, TROY.

329
00:22:02,955 --> 00:22:04,860
>> OH, WELL, SO THAT'S JARRETT
STIDHAM.

330
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:06,866
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT'S WHAT HE
LOOKED LIKE.
>> NO ONE DID.

331
00:22:06,866 --> 00:22:11,543
ONE THING I DO KNOW IS "QUEFS"
IS BACK AND I AM PHAT.

332
00:22:11,543 --> 00:22:14,593
THIS WEEK ON "QUEFS,"

FILLETS WITH A SIDE OF SLAY.

WATCHING QUEFS."

338
00:22:31,074 --> 00:22:33,324
QUEFS, IT'S GIVING QUEFS.

339
00:22:33,324 --> 00:22:36,092
>> TOLD YOU SUAVE WAS AN ACTOR.

340
00:22:36,092 --> 00:22:37,942

THERE.

341
00:22:37,942 --> 00:22:40,094

00:22:47,336 --> 00:22:50,607
>> OKAY.

TITLE?

346
00:22:50,607 --> 00:22:52,777
QUEFS.
IT SOUNDS WEIRD, RIGHT?

347
00:22:52,777 --> 00:22:54,329
ADD ONE MORE LETTER AND IT'S --

348
00:22:54,329 --> 00:22:56,316
>> OKAY, THANK YOU SO MUCH,
LISA.

349
00:22:56,316 --> 00:22:59,130
NO NEED TO SAY IT OUT LOUD.
I THINK EVERYBODY CLOCKED THAT.

350
00:22:59,130 --> 00:23:03,253
LET'S GO NOW TO OUR "KEYS TO THE
GAME" BROUGHT TO YOU BY FAN

00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:27,306
QUEFS.
THEY AIN'T BEEN HAD TO DO ALL
THAT, MAMA.

364
00:24:18,472 --> 00:24:21,443
I'M CASSIDY FLASK,

00:24:21,443 --> 00:24:26,784
WELCOME

367
00:24:29,831 --> 00:24:35,318

GAL IN FRONT OF YOU ONCE HAD NO
CONFIDENCE.

368
00:24:35,318 --> 00:24:39,541
I REMEMBER I ONCE LOST OUT ON A
JOB I REALLY WANTED.

369
00:24:39,541 --> 00:24:42,887
AND THEN I WAS LIKE, A JOB
DOESN'T DEFINE ME,

370
00:24:42,887 --> 00:24:44,684
I DEFINE ME.

371
00:24:44,684 --> 00:24:48,324
AND THAT'S HOW I FOUND THE POWER
IN ME.

372
00:24:48,324 --> 00:24:50,506
ANY QUESTIONS BEFORE WE START?

373
00:24:50,506 --> 00:24:53,519
>> WHY DIDN'T YOU GET THE JOB?

374
00:24:53,519 --> 00:24:58,571
>> SORRY?
>> THE JOB YOU WANTED.
WHY DIDN'T YOU GET IT?

375
00:24:58,571 --> 00:25:00,583
>> JUST DIDN'T GO ANY WAY.

376
00:25:00,583 --> 00:25:02,870
NOW, LET'S GET STARTED.

377
00:25:02,935 --> 00:25:05,966
>> DID THEY JUST NOT LIKE YOU?

378
00:25:06,809 --> 00:25:09,301
>> I JUST DIDN'T GET IT.

379
00:25:09,301 --> 00:25:13,329
NOW, THE JOB STORY'S JUST PART
OF MY INTRO, SO LET'S --

WEARING NOW?

00:25:18,473 --> 00:25:22,443
>> DID YOU WEAR THIS OUTFIT TO
THE INTERVIEW?

383
00:25:22,443 --> 00:25:25,401
>> NO.
>> WELL, THERE YOU GO.

384
00:25:25,401 --> 00:25:28,978
>> YOU KNOW, ONCE UPON A TIME,
THAT WOULD HAVE STUNG.

385
00:25:28,978 --> 00:25:32,797
BUT NOW I HEAR IT, AND I DON'T
FEAR IT.

386
00:25:32,797 --> 00:25:34,929

PANTS AND LEATHER GLOVES.

391
00:25:51,177 --> 00:25:52,817
JUST LET IT GO.

392
00:25:53,087 --> 00:25:56,256
>> OKAY, WELL -- THAT'S WHY SHE
DIDN'T GET THE JOB.

393
00:25:56,256 --> 00:25:59,578
>> OKAY.
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M GOING TO GET US BACK ON
TRACK.

394
00:25:59,578 --> 00:26:01,833
WHAT'S IMPORTANT IS FIRST
IMPRESSIONS.

395
00:26:01,833 --> 00:26:05,942
RULE NUMBER ONE.
SHOW THEM WHAT YOU'RE WORKING
WITH IT.

396
00:26:06,508 --> 00:26:10,326
LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT A SAMPLE
RESUME.

397
00:26:12,784 --> 00:26:16,911
>> I'M SORRY, IS THAT YOUR

398
00:26:16,911 --> 00:26:17,981
>> YEAH.

399
00:26:17,981 --> 00:26:20,840
WHAT DO WE NOTICE?
WHAT ARE WE SEEING HERE?

400
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:24,779
>> THAT YOU TAKE SELFIES LIKE AN
UBER DRIVER.

401
00:26:27,565 --> 00:26:29,862
>> YEAH. IT SAYS

402
00:26:29,862 --> 00:26:34,172
"DO VOICES AND PERSONAL
COMPUTER NO."

403
00:26:34,172 --> 00:26:38,310
>> IT ALSO SAY FROM 2014 TO 2025,

404
00:26:38,310 --> 00:26:41,371
YOU WERE A DOLLY PARTON
IMPERSONATOR.

405
00:26:41,371 --> 00:26:43,187
>> CAN WE SEE YOUR DOLLY PARTON?

406
00:26:43,187 --> 00:26:46,874
>> OKAY, GUYS, I DON'T HAVE THE
BOOBS WITH ME RIGHT NOW,

407
00:26:46,874 --> 00:26:49,342
AND
THAT WAS MOST OF IT, OKAY?

408
00:26:49,342 --> 00:26:52,375
>> I'M SORRY, WITH THAT RESUME,

409
00:26:52,375 --> 00:26:56,173
WHAT JOB COULD YOU HAVE POSSIBLY
BEEN INTERVIEWING FOR?

410
00:26:56,173 --> 00:26:59,831
>> OH, MY GOD, FINE.
SPEECHWRITER FOR MICHELLE OBAMA,
OKAY?

411
00:26:59,831 --> 00:27:02,289
>> WORD!
>> NO.

412
00:27:02,289 --> 00:27:04,708
>> OH, MY GOD, THERE'S A WRITING
SAMPLE AT THE BOTTOM.

413
00:27:04,708 --> 00:27:06,207
>> WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
IT SAYS,

414
00:27:06,207 --> 00:27:11,009
WHEN THEY GO LOW, WE GO
HIGH.
AM I RIGHT?

415
00:27:11,009 --> 00:27:13,074
SO WHERE'S EVERYBODY FROM?

416
00:27:13,074 --> 00:27:15,474
YOU IN THE FRONT, ARE YOU TWO A
COUPLE?

417
00:27:15,474 --> 00:27:19,136
THE GUY IN THE DORK-ASS HAT NEXT
TO THE GIRL WHO'S WAY OUT OF HIS
LEAGUE?

418
00:27:19,136 --> 00:27:22,707
MICHELLE LAUGHS THEN AD LIBS THE
REST OF THE SPEECH.

419
00:27:23,064 --> 00:27:28,048
>> YOU WROTE MICHELLE OBAMA
DOING CROWD WORK?

420
00:27:28,048 --> 00:27:30,365
>> GUYS, DO YOU WANT CONFIDENCE
OR NOT?

421
00:27:30,365 --> 00:27:33,509
>> I'M NOT REALLY SURE ANYMORE.

422
00:27:33,509 --> 00:27:35,627
>> WELL, I'M SURE ABOUT THIS.

423
00:27:35,627 --> 00:27:39,196
RULE NUMBER TWO.
CLOTHES TELL THE STORY.

424
00:27:39,196 --> 00:27:40,835
>> OH, NO.

425
00:27:40,835 --> 00:27:44,516
>> IS THAT YOUR BATHROOM?

426
00:27:44,516 --> 00:27:53,420
>> YOU KNOW WHAT, YOU GUYS ARE

427
00:27:53,422 --> 00:27:54,488
MISSING THE LESSONS.

428
00:27:54,490 --> 00:27:56,090
LET'S SHAKE THIS OFF, HUH?

429
00:27:56,092 --> 00:27:57,191
LET'S SHAKE THIS OFF.

430
00:27:57,193 --> 00:27:57,624
RELATIONSHIPS.

431
00:27:57,626 --> 00:28:01,128
WHEN I FOUND MY POWER, I FOUND A

432
00:28:01,130 --> 00:28:01,862
LOVING BOYFRIEND WHO'S WAITING

433
00:28:01,864 --> 00:28:04,498
OUTSIDE FOR ME RIGHT NOW.

434
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:07,701
>> HE'S OUTSIDE RIGHT NOW?

435
00:28:07,703 --> 00:28:08,402
>> YES.

436
00:28:08,404 --> 00:28:09,436
>> CAN YOU BRING HIM IN SO WE

437
00:28:09,438 --> 00:28:12,740
CAN MEET HIM?

438
00:28:12,742 --> 00:28:14,041
>> I DON'T WANT YOU TO MEET HIM.

439
00:28:14,443 --> 00:28:17,611
>> WHY NOT?

440
00:28:17,613 --> 00:28:18,512
>> BECAUSE OF HOW HE LOOKS.

441
00:28:18,914 --> 00:28:20,514
>> HOW DOES HE LOOK?

442
00:28:20,516 --> 00:28:20,914
>> NOT GOOD.

443
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,186
>> CAN YOU DESCRIBE HIM?

THERE'S A BOMB IN MY CAR ¶¶

1119
00:59:53,140 --> 00:59:56,742
THERE'S A BOMB IN MY CAR

1120
01:00:10,724 --> 01:00:20,766
¶ OH HEY-EY-EY

1121
01:00:20,768 --> 01:00:21,633
THANK YOU ¶¶

1122
01:00:42,255 --> 01:00:49,327
BEYOND THE HEADLINES WHERE WE

1123
01:00:49,329 --> 01:00:50,128
GO INTO THIS WEEK'S NEWS AND GET

1124
01:00:50,130 --> 01:00:51,897
A LITTLE DEEPER.

1125
01:00:51,899 --> 01:00:52,431
I'M MICHELLE DIXON.

1126
01:00:52,433 --> 01:00:53,131
WITH ME FROM "THE GUARDIAN,"

1127
01:00:53,133 --> 01:00:53,665

AND CALVIN EMMANUEL FROM "THE

1131
01:00:56,603 --> 01:00:58,737
CHICAGO TRIBUNE."

1132
01:00:58,739 --> 01:01:00,338
>> GREAT TO BE WITH YOU,

1133
01:01:00,340 --> 01:01:00,705
MICHELLE.

1134
01:01:00,707 --> 01:01:01,673
>> WELL, LET'S START IN

1135
01:01:01,675 --> 01:01:03,041
MINNEAPOLIS WHERE I.C.E.

1136
01:01:03,043 --> 01:01:04,709
CONTINUES TO RAID HOMES AND

1137
01:01:04,711 --> 01:01:06,478
BUSINESSES IN WHAT SOME PEOPLE

1138
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:07,646
ARE CALLING AN OCCUPATION.

1139
01:01:07,648 --> 01:01:08,914
CHRISTOPHER, YOUR TAKE ON THIS?

1140
01:01:08,916 --> 01:01:11,016
>> MICHELLE, THE FIRST WORD THAT

1141
01:01:11,018 --> 01:01:12,918
COMES TO MIND IS UNPRECEDENTED.

1142
01:01:12,920 --> 01:01:14,886
I MEAN, YOU'VE GOT FEDERAL

1143
01:01:14,888 --> 01:01:16,488
OFFICERS ROAMING THE STREETS

1144
01:01:16,490 --> 01:01:17,989
JUST PULLING PEOPLE OUT OF THEIR

1145
01:01:17,991 --> 01:01:20,358
CARS BASED ON HOW THEY LOOK.

1146
01:01:20,360 --> 01:01:21,326
I MEAN, THIS JUST DOESN'T HAPPEN

1147
01:01:21,328 --> 01:01:23,962
IN AMERICA.

1148
01:01:23,964 --> 01:01:24,296
>> HM.

1149
01:01:24,298 --> 01:01:24,796
>> HM.

1150
01:01:28,602 --> 01:01:31,303
>> YEAH, WELL -- I MEAN -- I

1151
01:01:31,305 --> 01:01:33,371
KNOW IT HAPPENS WITH SOME

1152
01:01:33,373 --> 01:01:33,705
POLICE.

1153
01:01:33,707 --> 01:01:35,707
THERE ARE CERTAINLY BAD COPS OUT

1154
01:01:35,709 --> 01:01:37,175
THERE, OF COURSE.

1155
01:01:37,177 --> 01:01:40,378
BUT THIS IS AN ENTIRE FEDERAL

1156
01:01:40,380 --> 01:01:42,147
FORCE WEAPONIZED AGAINST THE

1157
01:01:42,149 --> 01:01:43,081
PEOPLE IT'S SUPPOSED TO PROTECT.

1158
01:01:43,083 --> 01:01:45,417
IT'S INSANE.

1159
01:01:45,419 --> 01:01:45,750
>> HM.

1160
01:01:45,752 --> 01:01:49,654
>> HM.

1161
01:01:49,656 --> 01:01:50,222
>> OKAY, RIGHT, SURE.

1162
01:01:50,224 --> 01:01:52,858
OKAY.

1163
01:01:52,860 --> 01:01:55,327
BUT THE DIFFERENCE HERE IS THESE

1164
01:01:55,329 --> 01:01:57,128
OFFICERS ARE MARCHING THROUGH

1165
01:01:57,130 --> 01:01:58,997
NEIGHBORHOODS WITH THE EXPRESS

1166
01:01:58,999 --> 01:02:00,732
MISSION OF JUST STIRRING THINGS

1167
01:02:00,734 --> 01:02:01,500
UP SO THEY CAN VIOLENTLY ARREST

1168
01:02:01,502 --> 01:02:02,601
PEOPLE.

1169
01:02:02,603 --> 01:02:05,237
THAT'S NEW.

1170
01:02:05,239 --> 01:02:05,570
>> HM.

1171
01:02:05,572 --> 01:02:12,310
>> HM.

1172
01:02:12,312 --> 01:02:15,347
>> OKAY, I MEAN -- YOU GUYS KNOW

1173
01:02:15,349 --> 01:02:16,748
WHAT I MEAN, THOUGH.

1174
01:02:16,750 --> 01:02:17,449
CAN SOMEONE ELSE GO, PLEASE?

1175
01:02:17,851 --> 01:02:19,918
>> VERY WELL.

1176
01:02:19,920 --> 01:02:22,654
JACKIE, ON SUNDAY, ANTI-I.C.E.

1177
01:02:22,656 --> 01:02:23,788
PROTESTERS INTERRUPTED A CHURCH

1178
01:02:23,790 --> 01:02:24,122
SERVICE.

1179
01:02:24,124 --> 01:02:26,157
NOW THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION HAS

1180
01:02:26,159 --> 01:02:27,926
ARRESTED TWO PEOPLE.

1181
01:02:27,928 --> 01:02:29,427
ARE TACTICS LIKE THIS HURTING

1182
01:02:29,429 --> 01:02:29,928
THEIR CAUSE?

1183
01:02:29,930 --> 01:02:31,830
>> I MEAN, IT'S UNLIKELY.

1184
01:02:31,832 --> 01:02:33,431
THIS WAS AN ISOLATED INCIDENT

1185
01:02:33,433 --> 01:02:34,566
AND PROBABLY WON'T SLOW THE

1186
01:02:34,568 --> 01:02:35,300
MOVEMENT DOWN.

1187
01:02:35,302 --> 01:02:36,234
I MEAN, LET'S BE HONEST.

1188
01:02:36,236 --> 01:02:38,036
NOT A LOT OF DEMOCRATS GO TO

1189
01:02:38,038 --> 01:02:38,503
CHURCH ANYMORE.

1190
01:02:38,505 --> 01:02:38,837
>> HM.

1191
01:02:38,839 --> 01:02:41,907
>> HM.

1192
01:02:41,909 --> 01:02:43,275
>> I MEAN, OF COURSE DEMOCRATS

1193
01:02:43,277 --> 01:02:44,109
GO TO CHURCH.

1194
01:02:44,111 --> 01:02:45,243
BUT IT'S A COMMUNITY THING.

1195
01:02:45,245 --> 01:02:48,246
IT'S NOT JUST ALL ABOUT JESUS.

1196
01:02:48,248 --> 01:02:48,813
>> HM!

1197
01:02:48,815 --> 01:02:57,188
>> HM!

1198
01:02:58,425 --> 01:02:59,157
>> SHE SAID CHURCH AIN'T ABOUT

1199
01:02:59,159 --> 01:02:59,457
JESUS?

1200
01:02:59,459 --> 01:03:00,058
>> COLOR ME SURPRISED.

1201
01:03:00,060 --> 01:03:00,825
>> I KNOW IT'S ABOUT JESUS, IT'S

1202
01:03:00,827 --> 01:03:01,593
JUST LEFT-LEANING CHURCHES ARE

1203
01:03:01,595 --> 01:03:02,327
NOT, YOU KNOW, SO POLITICAL.

1204
01:03:02,329 --> 01:03:02,627
>> HM!

1205
01:03:02,629 --> 01:03:05,297
>> HM!

1206
01:03:05,299 --> 01:03:06,565
>> OKAY, STOP.

1207
01:03:06,567 --> 01:03:07,999
THAT'S NOT AT ALL WHAT I MEANT.

1208
01:03:08,001 --> 01:03:10,135
>> RIGHT, I MEAN, JACKIE KNOWS

1209
01:03:10,137 --> 01:03:12,137
VERY WELL THAT ALL KINDS OF

1210
01:03:12,139 --> 01:03:12,938
PEOPLE ATTEND CHURCH.

1211
01:03:12,940 --> 01:03:13,471
>> YES.

1212
01:03:13,473 --> 01:03:15,674
>> IF IT MATTERS, I'VE STARTED

1213
01:03:15,676 --> 01:03:16,708
GOING AGAIN.

1214
01:03:16,710 --> 01:03:17,242
>> REALLY?

1215
01:03:17,244 --> 01:03:18,043
GOOD FOR YOU.

1216
01:03:18,045 --> 01:03:18,944
>> YEAH.

1217
01:03:18,946 --> 01:03:20,345
EVER SINCE THEY CHANGED IT SO

1218
01:03:20,347 --> 01:03:22,047
YOU DON'T HAVE TO DRESS UP

1219
01:03:22,049 --> 01:03:22,480
ANYMORE.

1220
01:03:22,482 --> 01:03:23,815
I MEAN, HOW NICE IS IT TO WEAR

1221
01:03:23,817 --> 01:03:26,685
JEANS TO CHURCH, RIGHT?

1222
01:03:26,687 --> 01:03:26,985
>> HM!

1223
01:03:26,987 --> 01:03:31,623
>> HM!

1224
01:03:31,625 --> 01:03:32,757
>> LET'S MOVE ON TO

1225
01:03:32,759 --> 01:03:33,525
INTERNATIONAL NEWS.

1226
01:03:33,527 --> 01:03:34,526
THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION

1227
01:03:34,528 --> 01:03:38,563
CONTINUES TO TRY AND TAKE OVER

1228
01:03:38,565 --> 01:03:40,131
GREENLAND DESPITE FORCED

1229
01:03:40,133 --> 01:03:42,033
OPPOSITION FROM EUROPE.

1230
01:03:42,035 --> 01:03:42,934
JACKIE, HOW DOES THIS END?

1231
01:03:42,936 --> 01:03:45,370
>> I DON'T KNOW, BUT I DO KNOW,

1232
01:03:45,372 --> 01:03:47,105
IT'S LIKELY A VIOLATION OF

1233
01:03:47,107 --> 01:03:48,239
INTERNATIONAL LAW.

1234
01:03:48,241 --> 01:03:49,808
YOU CAN'T JUST POINT TO A

1235
01:03:49,810 --> 01:03:52,043
COUNTRY AND SAY, HEY, THAT'S

1236
01:03:52,045 --> 01:03:52,911

1237
01:03:52,913 --> 01:03:53,612
>> HM.

1238
01:03:53,614 --> 01:03:53,945
>> HM.

1239
01:03:53,947 --> 01:03:54,679
>> I MEAN, SOME COUNTRIES DO

1240
01:03:54,681 --> 01:03:56,982
THAT, BUT NOT AMERICA.

1241
01:03:56,984 --> 01:03:57,282
>> HM!

1242
01:03:57,284 --> 01:04:01,686
>> HM!

1243
01:04:01,688 --> 01:04:02,087
>> REALLY.

1244
01:04:02,089 --> 01:04:03,955
>> HAS SHE MET AMERICA?

1245
01:04:03,957 --> 01:04:05,090
>> OKAY, ENOUGH.

1246
01:04:05,092 --> 01:04:07,058
WILL YOU GUYS PLEASE STOP MAKING

1247
01:04:07,060 --> 01:04:07,759
THE NOISES?

1248
01:04:07,761 --> 01:04:08,493
>> NOISES?

1249
01:04:08,495 --> 01:04:09,160
WHO'S MAKING NOISES?

1250
01:04:09,162 --> 01:04:11,529
>> I'M SORRY, I DON'T HEAR A

1251
01:04:11,531 --> 01:04:11,830
PEEP.

1252
01:04:11,832 --> 01:04:13,498
>> YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY MAKING

1253
01:04:13,500 --> 01:04:14,532
NOISES, AND IT'S DISTRACTING.

1254
01:04:14,534 --> 01:04:16,034
CAN I AT LEAST GET THROUGH MY

1255
01:04:16,036 --> 01:04:16,668
POINT WITHOUT THE NOISES?

1256
01:04:16,670 --> 01:04:18,203
>> ABSOLUTELY.

1257
01:04:18,205 --> 01:04:19,571
GO AHEAD, AND I PROMISE WE WON'T

1258
01:04:19,573 --> 01:04:20,238
SAY A WORD.

1259
01:04:20,240 --> 01:04:21,906
>> NOT A WORD.

1260
01:04:21,908 --> 01:04:22,574
>> THANK YOU.

1261
01:04:22,576 --> 01:04:23,942
ALL I'M SAYING IS THAT DONALD

1262
01:04:23,944 --> 01:04:25,744
TRUMP MAY WANT TO JUST TAKE

1263
01:04:25,746 --> 01:04:26,611
SOMEONE ELSE'S LAND THROUGH

1264
01:04:26,613 --> 01:04:28,046
GREED AND AGGRESSION, BUT THE

1265
01:04:28,048 --> 01:04:30,015
REST OF US DON'T.

1266
01:04:30,017 --> 01:04:30,749
WE'RE AMERICA.

1267
01:04:30,751 --> 01:04:31,349
THIS IS NOT WHO WE ARE.

1268
01:04:31,351 --> 01:04:35,620
>> HM!

1269
01:04:36,023 --> 01:04:36,554
>> OKAY.

1270
01:04:36,556 --> 01:04:37,255
I THINK THAT GUY JUST MADE A

1271
01:04:37,257 --> 01:04:39,357
NOISE.

1272
01:04:39,359 --> 01:04:42,927
>> SORRY, JACKIE, I'LL ASK OUR

CAMERAMAN DARIUS NOT TO

INTERRUPT.

1275
01:04:45,098 --> 01:04:46,931
>> I'M SORRY, AIN'T KNOW Y'ALL

1276
01:04:46,933 --> 01:04:47,866
WAS DOING THAT.

1277
01:04:47,868 --> 01:04:51,803
>> LET'S TAKE A BREAK TO THANK

1278
01:04:51,805 --> 01:04:52,604
OUR CORE BROUGHT SPONSORS.

1279

WHEN WE RETURN, WE'LL TALK TO A

A.I.

1282
01:05:00,447 --> 01:05:03,682
NOT A COMPUTER, THE FORMER NBA

01:05:23,336 --> 01:05:24,102
>> GOD, I'M JUST SO NERVOUS.

1286
01:05:24,104 --> 01:05:24,836
>> DON'T BE NERVOUS, THEY'RE

1287
01:05:24,838 --> 01:05:26,104
GOING TO LOVE YOU.

1288

1290
01:05:27,841 --> 01:05:28,606
GOOD IMPRESSION.

1291
01:05:28,608 --> 01:05:29,574
>> YOU WILL.

1292
01:05:29,576 --> 01:05:30,842
YOU'RE GOING TO DO GREAT.

1293
01:05:30,844 --> 01:05:32,110
THEY'RE GOING TO LOVE YOU.

1294
01:05:32,112 --> 01:05:33,078
JUST ONE THING.

1295
01:05:33,080 --> 01:05:34,379
MY DAD'S FROM THE SOUTH.

1296
01:05:34,381 --> 01:05:35,847
>> THE SOUTH?

1297
01:05:35,849 --> 01:05:36,848
>> YEAH, SO HE'S PRETTY

1298
01:05:36,850 --> 01:05:37,849
OLD-FASHIONED.

1299
01:05:37,851 --> 01:05:38,583
SO JUST DON'T TALK POLITICS,

1300
01:05:38,585 --> 01:05:39,117
OKAY?

1301
01:05:39,119 --> 01:05:39,851
>> NO POLITICS.

1302
01:05:39,853 --> 01:05:40,618
>> NO POLITICS.

1303
01:05:40,620 --> 01:05:42,587
>> I CAN DO THAT.

1304
01:05:42,589 --> 01:05:45,356
>> MOM, DAD, WE'RE HOME!

1305
01:05:45,358 --> 01:05:48,793

>> AND THIS MUST BE THE GUY THAT

1308
01:05:51,732 --> 01:05:54,799
WE'VE HEARD SO MUCH ABOUT.

1309
01:05:54,801 --> 01:05:56,234
I HOPE THE DRIVE WASN'T TOO BAD.

1310
01:05:56,236 --> 01:05:56,968
>> IT WASN'T.

1311
01:05:56,970 --> 01:05:57,702
>> Y'ALL MADE GREAT TIME COMING

1312
01:05:57,704 --> 01:05:58,236

1313
01:05:58,238 --> 01:05:58,970
Y'ALL TAKE 87?

1314
01:05:58,972 --> 01:06:01,005
>> Y'ALL TAKE 87?

1315
01:06:08,715 --> 01:06:16,387
>> WELL, LET'S JUST MOVE ON.

1316
01:06:16,389 --> 01:06:20,892
>> FRESHERING A JAB RABBIT --

1317

>> BUT WHAT IF I TOLD YOU

1320
01:06:25,365 --> 01:06:26,097
BREAKING UP WAS MY GOAL HERE?

1321
01:06:26,099 --> 01:06:26,865
RELATIONSHIPS ARE HARD, AND MEN

1322
01:06:26,867 --> 01:06:27,599
ARE COWARDS.

1323
01:06:27,601 --> 01:06:28,333
SOMETIMES YOU WANT TO BREAK UP

1324
01:06:28,335 --> 01:06:29,100
BUT IT WOULD BE EASIER IF SHE

1325
01:06:29,102 --> 01:06:30,368
BROKE UP WITH YOU.

1326
01:06:30,370 --> 01:06:31,870
I'LL BE TEACHING YOU HOW TO BLOW

1327
01:06:31,872 --> 01:06:32,604

WITH METHODS FROM MY NEW BOOK,

1331
01:06:40,480 --> 01:06:43,481
LEAVE YOU BECAUSE LEAVING YOUR

1332
01:06:43,483 --> 01:06:44,215
LOVER IS HARD BECAUSE YOU LOVE

1333
01:06:44,217 --> 01:06:46,785

1334
01:06:46,787 --> 01:06:48,219
LOVER TO LEAVE NOW?

1335
01:06:48,221 --> 01:06:48,953
YOU WANT TO CAPITALIZE ON HIGHLY

1336
01:06:48,955 --> 01:06:49,754
CHARGED MOMENTS LIKE MEETING HER

1337
01:06:49,756 --> 01:06:50,221
PARENTS.

1338
01:06:50,223 --> 01:06:51,222
>> WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH

1339
01:06:51,224 --> 01:06:55,293
YOU?

1340
01:06:55,295 --> 01:06:57,028
>> OUT TO LUNCH, STILL AM NOT

1341
01:06:57,030 --> 01:06:57,328
FINE.

1342
01:06:58,231 --> 01:06:58,930
>> BUT ANOTHER HIGHLY CHARGED

1343
01:06:58,932 --> 01:06:59,564
MOMENT IS VALENTINE'S DAY.

1344
01:06:59,566 --> 01:07:00,265
>> BABE, YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO.

1345
01:07:00,267 --> 01:07:00,732
>> OH, I DID.

1346
01:07:00,734 --> 01:07:01,366
I JUST -- I SAW IT, AND I

1347
01:07:01,368 --> 01:07:02,967
IMMEDIATELY THOUGHT OF YOU.

1348
01:07:02,969 --> 01:07:06,237
>> 100 TAMPONS?

1349
01:07:06,239 --> 01:07:06,971
>> A VERY CHARGED MOMENT IS A

1350
01:07:06,973 --> 01:07:08,706
FAMILY FUNERAL.

1351
01:07:08,708 --> 01:07:10,008
IF YOU WANT TO END YOUR

1352
01:07:10,010 --> 01:07:10,708
RELATIONSHIP, TRY SHOWING UP

1353

LUMINEERS.

1355
01:07:19,886 --> 01:07:21,519
IF YOU'RE JUST STARTING THE DAY,

1356
01:07:21,521 --> 01:07:24,722
BLOWING IT CAN BE AS SIMPLE

1357
01:07:24,724 --> 01:07:25,456
AS WEARING SOMETHING THAT MAKES

1358
01:07:25,458 --> 01:07:25,924
YOU SEEM GROSS.

1359

>> SHOULD WE DO A BOTTLE?

1360
01:07:30,130 --> 01:07:31,329
GOING TO HIT THE RESTROOM.

1361
01:07:31,331 --> 01:07:32,597
>> HERE'S ONE.

1362
01:07:32,599 --> 01:07:33,598
THE NEXT TIME SHE COMES TO YOU

1363
01:07:33,600 --> 01:07:35,333
