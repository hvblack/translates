1
00:00:05,109 --> 00:00:07,837
Get the stew right up
under her nose.

2
00:00:07,837 --> 00:00:09,244
And let it waft up in.

3
00:00:09,244 --> 00:00:11,729
She keeps moving and her hair
keeps getting in the stew.

4
00:00:11,729 --> 00:00:13,528
Guys, hey, guys, guys.
You can stop.

5
00:00:13,528 --> 00:00:16,505
Stew has never
woken anyone up, ever.

6
00:00:16,505 --> 00:00:18,136
Here, give me-give me stew.
I'll eat it.

7
00:00:18,136 --> 00:00:20,304
All right, fine.
But I feel like the stew...
No, see?

8
00:00:20,304 --> 00:00:23,214
It's... Oh, it worked!
Here she comes!
Hey, Dee!

9
00:00:23,214 --> 00:00:25,596
- Don't worry, Dee...
- Hi, Dee. Was it the stew
that woke you up?

10
00:00:25,596 --> 00:00:26,801
Ow. What happened?

11
00:00:26,801 --> 00:00:30,516
Oh, don't worry.
We're, uh, safe and sound
in Patty's Pub.

12
00:00:30,516 --> 00:00:32,324
What? We're back home?

13
00:00:32,324 --> 00:00:35,116
- Oh, no, no, no.
It's, uh "Patty's" with a T.

14
00:00:35,116 --> 00:00:36,656
- P-A-T-T-Y.
- What is going on?

15
00:00:36,656 --> 00:00:40,238
What-what time is it?
What day is it?
Wait, did I miss the thing?

16
00:00:40,238 --> 00:00:42,442
- What thing? Oh, the show?
- Uh, the acting thing?
- Oh, yeah, you missed it.

17
00:00:42,442 --> 00:00:45,305
- Oh, oh, no.
- No.
- Did you still want to do that?

18
00:00:45,305 --> 00:00:48,111
- You still want to do...
That's not gonna happen.
- Oh, no!
Oh, goddamn you.

19
00:00:48,111 --> 00:00:50,180
You're not gonna be able to walk
back to the city

20
00:00:50,224 --> 00:00:51,928
'cause we're way out in the...

21
00:00:54,984 --> 00:00:57,335
What? No!

22
00:00:57,335 --> 00:01:02,965
Oh, goddamn it!

23
00:01:06,698 --> 00:01:09,639
STILL

24
00:01:26,512 --> 00:01:28,610
I cannot believe you guys
did this to me.

25
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:32,866
Dee, can you please be grateful
about this experience?
I mean, take it in, will you?

26
00:01:32,866 --> 00:01:35,211
Uh, here we are.
We're-we're in
this charming little pub.

27
00:01:35,211 --> 00:01:37,942
You can smell fresh peat grass
burning in the fireplace.

28
00:01:37,942 --> 00:01:41,740
You know, well,
along with the, uh,
the evidence of Frank's
involvement
in a sex trafficking ring.

29
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:42,751
- Alleged.

30
00:01:42,751 --> 00:01:46,108
Yeah, Dee, look,
you got to embrace this.
You know?
All you're doing is complaining.

31
00:01:46,108 --> 00:01:48,161
This place is amazing.

32
00:01:48,161 --> 00:01:51,500
With the exception
of all the sheep wool.
Is that bothering anybody else?

33
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:54,345
No, because we don't have COVID
like you do.
- You're sick.

34
00:01:54,345 --> 00:01:55,453
- No, I don't have COVID.

35
00:01:55,453 --> 00:01:58,274
Even the beer here sucks.
Will you look at this?
It's all foam.

36
00:01:58,274 --> 00:01:59,719
What are you doing?

37
00:02:01,032 --> 00:02:05,580
Oh. Sorry.
We-we run our own bar,
so I forget and sometimes
I serve myself.

38
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:06,663
- I'm just gonna squeak by you.

39
00:02:06,663 --> 00:02:09,100
Actually, while I got you here,
pal, can I ask you a question?

40
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:12,573
Do you know a fella
in this town,
goes by the name
of Shelley Kelly?

41
00:02:12,573 --> 00:02:16,424
Yeah, everybody knows him.
He's the, uh, local,
uh, cheesemonger.

42
00:02:17,004 --> 00:02:21,644
H-He's the, uh...
cheese mongrel. Wow.
I did not know he was a mongrel.

43
00:02:21,644 --> 00:02:24,800
Um, how severe is it?
Can-can he walk?
Does he drool, or...

44
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,022
- Monger, Charlie. Cheesemonger.
Cheesemonger.

45
00:02:27,022 --> 00:02:29,344
Mon... Cheese...
Why are you saying it that way?

46
00:02:29,344 --> 00:02:31,279
Is he a mongrel or a monster?
That's all I want to know.

47
00:02:31,279 --> 00:02:33,245
- I wonder if he's cute.
- Who?

48
00:02:33,245 --> 00:02:36,646
- Your brother,
the cheese monster.
- Do not have sex
with my brother, Mac.

49
00:02:36,646 --> 00:02:40,785
You know,
when I was Irish first,
then I-then I wanted to
find out what my heritage was.

50
00:02:40,785 --> 00:02:43,534
But now that I'm gay first,
and that's my identity,

51
00:02:43,534 --> 00:02:47,992
then maybe I should just
be plowing a bunch of dudes,
and-and maybe a bunch of
cheese monsters. I don't know.

52
00:02:47,992 --> 00:02:49,800
- Stop! Would you just...
- There's gay or badass.

53
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,183
You need to shut up, okay?

54
00:02:51,183 --> 00:02:55,207
Identity doesn't have to factor
into absolutely
every decision you make.

55
00:02:55,207 --> 00:02:59,621
All right? If a man wants
to stand, he doesn't go,
"Uh, uh, what would
a Dutchman do?
Would a Dutchman stand?"

56
00:02:59,621 --> 00:03:02,325
And if-if an Italian wants
to eat a sandwich,

57
00:03:02,325 --> 00:03:05,289
he doesn't go, "I have to eat
plates of spaghetti
because I'm an Italian."

58
00:03:05,289 --> 00:03:07,075
He just eats
the goddamn sandwich.

59
00:03:07,075 --> 00:03:09,121
Okay? Oh, you fool.

60
00:03:09,121 --> 00:03:11,673
If you want to go out and bang
every single guy in Ireland,

61
00:03:11,673 --> 00:03:14,860
just go bang every guy
in Ireland
and forget what your identity
has to do with it.

62
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:19,298
Or you could just find one guy,
fall in love,
get in a relationship
and shut the hell up about it.

63
00:03:19,298 --> 00:03:20,295
- Please stop doing that.

64
00:03:20,295 --> 00:03:24,181
- Oh, come on, man!
If I got to stop mid-rant every
time I want to order a beer,

65
00:03:24,181 --> 00:03:25,814
i-it's gonna interrupt my flow.

66
00:03:25,854 --> 00:03:29,897
Right? Why don't you just keep
track of what we're drinking
and charge it to
our individual rooms.

67
00:03:29,897 --> 00:03:31,687
Oh, there's only one room.

68
00:03:31,687 --> 00:03:34,747
One room? Wha...
How's that gonna work?

69
00:03:34,747 --> 00:03:36,557
- Nah, that's good.
- That's good?

70
00:03:36,557 --> 00:03:38,766
All of us crammed in
one wool-infested room--
that sounds good to you?

71
00:03:38,766 --> 00:03:42,862
You want an authentic
European experience.
That's what it is.

72
00:03:42,862 --> 00:03:44,049
- Well, no, that...
That's too authentic, okay?

73
00:03:44,049 --> 00:03:47,649
I'm not-I'm not...
I'm not staying here.
I'm gonna rent a castle.

74
00:03:47,649 --> 00:03:49,592
- Well, wait for me.
I'm not staying, either.

75
00:03:49,592 --> 00:03:51,691
I'll tell you what, I'm not
paying for this beer, okay?

76
00:03:51,691 --> 00:03:54,232
'Cause you can barely swallow
this sludge.

77
00:04:04,652 --> 00:04:09,617
- Oh, oh, Dennis, hey.
You should let me do
the talking in there, okay?
- Why?

78
00:04:09,617 --> 00:04:13,481
- Why?
'Cause if you cough in there,
they're not gonna rent us
the castle 'cause they're
gonna know you have COVID.

79
00:04:13,481 --> 00:04:15,855
Dee, you bitch.
I don't have COVID.

80
00:04:15,855 --> 00:04:17,145
I'm not gonna
cough in there.

81
00:04:17,225 --> 00:04:21,483
You-you think I can't
pinch off a cough?
I will do the talking.

82
00:04:25,688 --> 00:04:28,269
Hi there.
Beautiful day, isn't it? Huh?

83
00:04:28,269 --> 00:04:30,578
G-Grand, as you say.

84
00:04:30,665 --> 00:04:33,062
I think what they say
is, "Top o' the mornin'."

85
00:04:33,062 --> 00:04:38,244
Ah, that's a stereotype. Yeah.
Excuse my sister, she's, uh,
not very good at talking.

86
00:04:38,244 --> 00:04:40,922
Um, so we're actually here
looking f...

87
00:04:44,753 --> 00:04:48,481
Oh, gosh.
You okay there, Dennis?

88
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:53,946
Huh. Looks like I'll be doing
the talking.

89
00:04:53,946 --> 00:04:59,146
- Uh, we would be looking
for a castle,
and we are very interested
in modern amenities, please.

90
00:04:59,146 --> 00:05:01,895
You know, your thermostats and
your remotes and shit like that.

91
00:05:01,895 --> 00:05:04,515
Ar-Are you jotting
any of this down?

92
00:05:04,515 --> 00:05:07,747
- Yeah, yeah, right. So... Sorry.
You caught me
a little off guard, is all.

93
00:05:07,747 --> 00:05:10,335
So, you're-you're looking
for a castle?

94
00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:14,506
- Is he all right?

95
00:05:15,791 --> 00:05:19,216
Yeah, he's okay.
Well, yes and no.

96
00:05:19,216 --> 00:05:22,152
- You know what it is?
He's a mongrel.

97
00:05:22,152 --> 00:05:23,534
No.

98
00:05:23,534 --> 00:05:25,423
And that's why I've always
been the talker.

99
00:05:25,423 --> 00:05:29,842
Bitch. Bitch.
- Oh, boy, did you hear that?
Yep, here-here he goes.
Here he goes.

100
00:05:29,842 --> 00:05:32,341
We have to keep him
in the basement in America,

101
00:05:32,341 --> 00:05:36,509
'cause one of his ticks is that
he brutally masturbates himself.

102
00:05:36,509 --> 00:05:38,132
No, no.
- Oh, yeah.

103
00:05:38,132 --> 00:05:40,264
- Yeah, he-he does
a real number on it.

104
00:05:40,264 --> 00:05:44,170
He-he's shredded it down
to a little tiny nub
at this point.
- No!

105
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:45,867
Is what it is.
No, no. He's saying,

106
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:48,055
"Down there,
there's barely anything left."

107
00:05:48,055 --> 00:05:50,807
- That's what he's saying.
There's nothing left down there.

108
00:05:50,807 --> 00:05:56,069
- Yeah, so, um,
I don't see you doing
a lot of castle searching.

109
00:06:04,732 --> 00:06:06,340
Bitch.

110
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:09,189
He's also allergic to sheep.

111
00:06:13,733 --> 00:06:16,206
Go on, go on, out.

112
00:06:16,278 --> 00:06:19,094
Get out, you bastards!

113
00:06:19,094 --> 00:06:21,181
- Hello, sir?

114
00:06:21,181 --> 00:06:23,849
Oh, sorry.
I was, uh...

115
00:06:23,849 --> 00:06:25,523
Just bashing some rats.

116
00:06:25,523 --> 00:06:29,405
I get it. It's cool.
Don't worry about it.
I bash a lot of rats
in my business, too.

117
00:06:29,405 --> 00:06:32,806
And-and rats love cheese,
so I imagine y-you get
a lot of 'em here.

118
00:06:32,806 --> 00:06:34,570
- This is, like,
the place for rats.
- Yeah, yeah.

119
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:35,967
Well, how can I help you?

120
00:06:35,967 --> 00:06:40,880
Uh, right, well,
uh, I'm looking for, uh,
a young man named Shelley Kelly.
Is he around?

121
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,566
I'm Shelley Kelly.
Who's asking?

122
00:06:43,566 --> 00:06:47,795
Oh. I'm sorry. I...
I'm looking for a-a younger man.

123
00:06:47,795 --> 00:06:50,512
Uh, I'm looking for
the young Shelley Kelly.
Is he around?

124
00:06:50,512 --> 00:06:53,247
Hey, you-you mind if I sample
some of your jellies?

125
00:06:53,247 --> 00:06:56,579
- Oh, no. Go on. Help yourself.
- Ah.
- Delightful.

126
00:06:56,945 --> 00:07:02,439
Well, I'm...
I'm the only Shelley Kelly
around here that I know of.

127
00:07:03,206 --> 00:07:06,881
This is the tits right here.

128
00:07:06,881 --> 00:07:08,789
- Yeah, no, that...
that doesn't make sense.

129
00:07:08,789 --> 00:07:12,559
See-see, Shelley Kelly
is a-is a kid like me.
Uh, we're pen pals.

130
00:07:12,559 --> 00:07:17,058
Sweet Jesus.
Charlie?

131
00:07:17,058 --> 00:07:20,524
Ugh. That's a miss.
It's got something in it
like sand.

132
00:07:20,524 --> 00:07:22,288
It's full of sand.
Ech.

133
00:07:22,288 --> 00:07:24,166
Yeah, I... I'm Charlie.

134
00:07:24,166 --> 00:07:26,632
Mmm. I know what it is.
It's seeds.

135
00:07:26,632 --> 00:07:29,976
Is there seeds in it?
And there's too many of 'em.

136
00:07:30,142 --> 00:07:32,216
There's a lot of seeds.

137
00:07:32,216 --> 00:07:35,753
pen pal

138
00:07:35,753 --> 00:07:39,942
sorry

139
00:07:39,942 --> 00:07:44,312
speak

140
00:07:44,312 --> 00:07:46,952
sense

141
00:07:47,170 --> 00:07:50,121
now

142
00:07:52,048 --> 00:07:54,781
brother

143
00:07:54,781 --> 00:07:58,189
son

144
00:07:59,271 --> 00:08:04,008
father

145
00:08:04,757 --> 00:08:07,400
It was a bad one.
That's buried in there.

146
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:10,575
That's gonna be in there
all week. Oh, God.

147
00:08:10,952 --> 00:08:13,032
What'd I miss?

148
00:08:14,894 --> 00:08:17,895
Hello! Hello... Hello?

149
00:08:17,956 --> 00:08:20,335
Oh, Father, Father, Father,
I've got news.

150
00:08:20,335 --> 00:08:22,534
I've got wonderful news.

151
00:08:22,534 --> 00:08:27,977
Okay, so, I used to be Irish,
and now I'm Dutch.

152
00:08:27,977 --> 00:08:28,898
Of course, I was badass
the entire time,

153
00:08:28,994 --> 00:08:31,764
but when you surround yourself
with people who aren't
as badass as you,

154
00:08:31,764 --> 00:08:33,742
that tends to be
quite isolating.

155
00:08:33,742 --> 00:08:36,496
The point is I was confused.

156
00:08:36,496 --> 00:08:39,794
To be honest with you, I wanted
to run through a bunch of pipe,
if you know what I mean...

157
00:08:39,794 --> 00:08:40,915
Well, you know what I mean.

158
00:08:40,915 --> 00:08:46,049
But then I decided,
you know what?
I only want
one man inside of me.

159
00:08:46,049 --> 00:08:48,613
The Big Man.
The Big Man upstairs.

160
00:08:48,613 --> 00:08:50,863
The only man
that can fill me up.

161
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:54,764
Well, and his son.
And the Holy Spirit.
I'll take all three of them
at once.

162
00:08:54,764 --> 00:08:58,337
I've done that before.
That was more in a physical
sense, not a spiritual one.

163
00:08:58,337 --> 00:09:02,719
And believe me, it was messy.
Totally worth it, though.
I loved it.

164
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:08,215
Either way, Father,
what I have decided is that
the most important aspect
of my identity--

165
00:09:08,277 --> 00:09:11,947
it's not being gay.
It's not being Irish.
It's not being badass.

166
00:09:11,947 --> 00:09:13,948
It's being Catholic.

167
00:09:13,948 --> 00:09:19,015
Therefore, I want to become
a Catholic priest!

168
00:09:19,416 --> 00:09:23,398
- Well, that's nice to hear.

169
00:09:23,398 --> 00:09:28,148
But perhaps we could talk
at a more appropriate time.

170
00:09:32,175 --> 00:09:34,062
Uh... Yeah. Sorry.
Sorry, everybody.

171
00:09:34,062 --> 00:09:37,832
I'll just get
in the back of the line,
and then, uh, get the cracker,
and then we'll talk later.

172
00:09:41,277 --> 00:09:44,300
Oh, goddamn it,
what the hell is this?

173
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:47,702
That realtor screwed us.
Probably because
you caused a scene.

174
00:09:47,702 --> 00:09:50,377
What are you talking about, Dee?
This-this place is amazing.

175
00:09:50,377 --> 00:09:53,707
I mean, I saw
an old bell tower outside
and what I think
used to be a moat.

176
00:09:53,707 --> 00:09:55,297
Okay, this place is perfect.

177
00:09:55,297 --> 00:09:59,171
- This place is not perfect.
It's a ruin.
We can't sleep here.

178
00:09:59,171 --> 00:10:03,233
Wh... Dee, I'm sure
there's, like, a furnished area
with, like, bedrooms and shit
somewhere.

179
00:10:03,233 --> 00:10:06,574
I mean, what, do you,
what, do you want
to walk into a castle...
and have it feel like a Hyatt?

180
00:10:06,574 --> 00:10:07,990
I mean, where's the charm
in that?

181
00:10:08,072 --> 00:10:10,993
Whoa.
This place has a dark past.

182
00:10:10,993 --> 00:10:13,294
Murder, betrayal, beheadings.

183
00:10:13,294 --> 00:10:17,890
Well, you know,
it's a castle, Dee.
You know, people were going
crazy in castles all the time.

184
00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:21,881
And beheading people--
well, that-that was just
their way of solving problems
back then, you know.

185
00:10:21,881 --> 00:10:24,756
That's tenth century
charm for you.

186
00:10:25,465 --> 00:10:28,279
- Yeah.
Yeah, this was in 2008.

187
00:10:28,279 --> 00:10:32,604
Two... What?
- Yeah. A mother
went insane and beheaded
all four children.

188
00:10:32,604 --> 00:10:33,931
- Just chopped their heads
right off.

189
00:10:33,931 --> 00:10:37,533
- Well, that-that is... that's decidedly
less charming, isn't it?
- It's a little less charming.

190
00:10:37,593 --> 00:10:39,425
I'm not sleeping here, Dennis.
It's very creepy.

191
00:10:39,425 --> 00:10:43,072
No, Dee. This is gonna be great.
Trust me.
This is gon-this is gonna
be awesome, okay?
Just...

192
00:10:43,072 --> 00:10:46,267
I don't care for
all the sheep, though.
That's-that's my only thing.

193
00:10:46,267 --> 00:10:48,882
All... all what sheep?
We haven't seen a sheep.

194
00:10:48,882 --> 00:10:52,478
-  The sheep, the sheep.
I-I'm sure they've been
passing through, and that's...
- Thr... They've been passing
through the... into the castle?

195
00:10:52,478 --> 00:10:56,815
- Well, why else would
I be coughing and wheezing?
- You have COVID.

196
00:10:56,815 --> 00:11:01,550
- To Charlie, my son.
- To the dad I didn't know I had.

197
00:11:02,885 --> 00:11:08,108
Well, I'm just sorry that
I didn't get a chance
to see you growing up.
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

198
00:11:08,108 --> 00:11:11,794
And for what it's worth,
I did love your mother.

199
00:11:11,794 --> 00:11:12,862
So did I.

200
00:11:12,929 --> 00:11:16,131
We all did.
A wonderful woman.

201
00:11:16,131 --> 00:11:17,138
I banged her, too.

202
00:11:17,195 --> 00:11:20,864
- All right, well, Mom got around.
- Well, yeah.

203
00:11:20,934 --> 00:11:24,715
Hey, this is jammed in there.
What do you call it?
What is that?

204
00:11:24,715 --> 00:11:26,663
A lingonberry seed or something?

205
00:11:26,663 --> 00:11:28,856
The important thing
is you're here now.
- Yeah. Yeah.

206
00:11:28,856 --> 00:11:31,272
- Yeah. And I don't want to waste
any more time.
- No, neither do I.

207
00:11:31,272 --> 00:11:34,467
I mean, God, I've...
I've always had
so many questions, you know?

208
00:11:34,467 --> 00:11:37,707
About who I am
and where I come from.

209
00:11:38,916 --> 00:11:41,744
My-my family heritage,
and-and, uh...

210
00:11:41,744 --> 00:11:43,126
You know, it's good to have
some truth about...

211
00:11:43,126 --> 00:11:45,991
Will you stop?!
You're just...
You're sucking
and slurping away.

212
00:11:45,991 --> 00:11:48,060
I'm trying to have
a conversation
with my father.

213
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:50,834
- It's jammed in there, Charlie. I can't get it out.
- I don't care,
go to the bathroom...

214
00:11:50,834 --> 00:11:55,473
- I'm gonna need a jackhammer.
- You're using a screw.
You're embarrassing me
in front of my dad here, man.

215
00:11:55,473 --> 00:11:56,411
Sorry about him.

216
00:11:56,411 --> 00:12:00,858
- Charlie, I'm just glad
that you're sitting here now.

- Where's the bathroom?

236
00:13:23,291 --> 00:13:26,918
Walking this path
is a serious commitment.

237
00:13:26,918 --> 00:13:30,059
One that requires
considerable training.

238
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:35,214
Oh, Father, look, I-I've been
S'ing and F'ing
my way through life
for far too long.

239
00:13:35,214 --> 00:13:38,604
I think it's time that
I started sucking down
the words of the Bible.

240
00:13:38,604 --> 00:13:42,211
And instead of looking for
pieces of ass,
I'd just look for peace.

I think.

243
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:53,670
So, to truly understand
what this life is like,

244
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:57,456
you need to spend some time
with someone who's living it.

245
00:13:57,456 --> 00:14:01,401

- Father...

254
00:14:40,158 --> 00:14:44,332
I-I'm gonna be alone
in the seminary
with him, in the rectory?

255
00:14:44,332 --> 00:14:48,377
I mean, these are very
triggering words.
I will S and F him
into oblivion.

256
00:14:48,377 --> 00:14:50,863
I mean, he looks like
Paul Bunyan.

257

Elmer Fudd. You got any Fudds?

Let me take a look.

259
00:14:55,625 --> 00:14:57,963
Oh, yeah. What about this guy?
What's his story?

260
00:14:57,963 --> 00:15:02,078
- Gus?
- Gus? Yeah, I ain't
falling in love with Gus.

261
00:15:02,078 --> 00:15:05,595
- Gimme him.
- Sure.

262
00:15:12,171 --> 00:15:15,349
See, Dee?
The bedroom's perfect.

263
00:15:18,514 --> 00:15:21,154
Dude, I think
you need a ventilator.

264
00:15:21,154 --> 00:15:24,352
I just need
a good night's sleep.

265
00:15:24,352 --> 00:15:27,228
Just go to bed.

266
00:15:32,553 --> 00:15:38,127
I agree with you, I just...
Well, I don't know
what to do with her.

267
00:15:40,544 --> 00:15:44,252
- What?
- What?

268
00:15:44,252 --> 00:15:46,743
Who you talking to?

269
00:15:46,743 --> 00:15:50,433
Nobody.
You're hearing things Dee.

270
00:15:50,698 --> 00:15:54,338
I think what I'm hearing
is fluid fill up your lungs.

271
00:15:54,338 --> 00:15:57,856
Dee, just go to bed.

272
00:15:57,856 --> 00:15:59,894
Okay.

273
00:16:06,663 --> 00:16:09,530
It has to be tonight?

274
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:12,377
Okay, Dennis,
I don't like that.
I don't like it.

275
00:16:12,377 --> 00:16:17,536
I'm not even talking to you.
I'm talking to the castle.

276
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:20,830
You're talking to the castle?

277
00:16:22,005 --> 00:16:26,853
- I-Is it talking back?
- Dee, just go to bed!

278
00:16:34,643 --> 00:16:39,153
- It's the hair, by the way.
- Okay, n...

279
00:16:39,222 --> 00:16:42,526
right now, are you
talking to me or the castle?

280
00:16:42,526 --> 00:16:47,296
You.
We were talking about
beheadings earlier.

281
00:16:47,296 --> 00:16:51,722
- It's the hair.
- What's the hair?

282
00:16:51,722 --> 00:16:55,300
Well, that's the trouble
with heads, isn't it?

283
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:59,982
The hair's not authentic.
It's... it's been tampered with.

284
00:16:59,982 --> 00:17:04,127
That's why there's no smell.
It's a... it's a lie.

285
00:17:04,127 --> 00:17:08,811
The hair is on the head.
The hair is a lie,

286
00:17:08,811 --> 00:17:12,980
and therefore,
it's better to just
remove the head altogether.

287
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:16,035
Okay. Okay, Dennis,
you're very, very sick,

288
00:17:16,078 --> 00:17:18,211
- and you need to go
to the hospital.
- Silence!

289
00:17:23,651 --> 00:17:26,088
Dee, I can't breathe.
I need to go to the hospital.

290
00:17:26,132 --> 00:17:27,872
Yeah, no shit!

291
00:17:27,916 --> 00:17:29,787
Oh, my God.
I'm gonna call us an ambulance

292
00:17:29,831 --> 00:17:30,962
- and get us out of here.
- Yeah.

293
00:17:31,006 --> 00:17:32,790
No, no, my phone's dead.

294
00:17:32,834 --> 00:17:34,966
Oh, there's no electricity
in this goddamn place.

295
00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:36,446
Then go get the car
and drive me.

296
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:37,795
The car's out of gas.

297
00:17:37,839 --> 00:17:39,145
Then ring the bell!

298
00:17:39,188 --> 00:17:41,103
What bell?

299
00:17:41,147 --> 00:17:42,452
Go to the old bell tower

300
00:17:42,496 --> 00:17:45,455
and ring the goddamn bell,
you bitch!

301
00:17:45,499 --> 00:17:48,806
Oh, God, um...

302
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:53,594
Goddamn it.
Where's the stupid bell tower?

303
00:17:53,637 --> 00:17:54,986
No. No, no, no, no.

304
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:56,684
- Oh, Jesus Christ.

305
00:17:56,727 --> 00:17:58,512
- Oh!

306
00:17:58,555 --> 00:18:00,122
- Oh... Oh!

307
00:18:00,166 --> 00:18:03,647
Oh, oh, oh...

308
00:18:03,691 --> 00:18:06,824
Aah! Get off me!
Get off me!

309
00:18:06,868 --> 00:18:08,913
Okay...

310
00:18:11,612 --> 00:18:14,615
- Hello?

311
00:18:14,658 --> 00:18:15,659
Who is that?

312
00:18:18,706 --> 00:18:22,666
Your head is a lie.

313
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:25,582
Dennis?
What are you doing?

314
00:18:25,626 --> 00:18:29,151
You've tampered with it, and...

315
00:18:29,195 --> 00:18:30,848
we won't stand for it
any longer.

316
00:18:30,892 --> 00:18:35,157
Oh, D... Dennis, this is just
the COVID talking, okay?

317
00:18:35,201 --> 00:18:36,463
You're hallucinating.

318
00:18:37,812 --> 00:18:39,857
I don't have COVID.

319
00:18:48,083 --> 00:18:49,780
No, Dennis, please.

320
00:18:49,824 --> 00:18:52,914
Please, Dennis, it's me.
Snap out of it.

321
00:18:59,225 --> 00:19:00,965
So, that's the house.

322
00:19:01,009 --> 00:19:02,141
- Wow.
- Oh, this place

323
00:19:02,184 --> 00:19:04,360
- is charming as shit.
- Yeah.

324
00:19:04,404 --> 00:19:06,319
- Dennis would be creaming
in his pants if he saw this.
- Yeah.

325
00:19:06,362 --> 00:19:08,147
Right, well, uh,
language, Frank,

326
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:10,149
- you know, 'cause
we're guests, so, yeah.
- Oh, yeah.

327
00:19:10,192 --> 00:19:11,802
It's a lovely home.

328
00:19:11,846 --> 00:19:14,718
Uh, are you sure okay
with us staying the night?

329
00:19:14,762 --> 00:19:16,720
Oh, I insist.
Yeah.

330
00:19:16,764 --> 00:19:18,374
I have a spare room
is down the hall,

331
00:19:18,418 --> 00:19:20,115
and, uh, I set up a cot
for you there.

332
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:22,422
Oh, well, we'll take the cot.

333
00:19:22,465 --> 00:19:24,946
Y... You'll both
sleep on the cot?

334
00:19:24,989 --> 00:19:29,559
Uh, I think I'd rather
take the bedroom, Frank.

335
00:19:29,603 --> 00:19:32,083
Won't you get lonely in there?
What if it gets cold?

336
00:19:32,127 --> 00:19:33,259
Oh, there are plenty
of blankets.

337
00:19:33,302 --> 00:19:34,564
What if I poop the bed?

338
00:19:34,608 --> 00:19:36,436
Who's gonna be in there
to laugh with me?

339
00:19:36,479 --> 00:19:38,786
- What? You might shit the bed?
- No, no, no.

340
00:19:38,829 --> 00:19:40,309
If that's the case,
I have other sheets.

341
00:19:40,353 --> 00:19:42,224
- No, no, no, he won't.
- One time.

342
00:19:42,268 --> 00:19:44,531
- It was fun...
- There was a one-time incident,

343
00:19:44,574 --> 00:19:45,923
- It was a fun thing.
- and it was a joke,

344
00:19:45,967 --> 00:19:47,229
and it really
wasn't that funny, so...

345
00:19:47,273 --> 00:19:49,405
- It wasn't?
- Uh, no.

346
00:19:49,449 --> 00:19:51,973
- I thought you thought
it was funny.
- Nope.

347
00:19:52,016 --> 00:19:53,931
Well, uh, I'm heading off.

348
00:19:53,975 --> 00:19:55,411
Yeah. Sounds good.

349
00:19:55,455 --> 00:19:57,805
- Good night.
- Yeah, yeah.

350
00:19:57,848 --> 00:20:00,982
Hey, um, good night...

351
00:20:01,983 --> 00:20:03,593
...Dad.

352
00:20:03,637 --> 00:20:06,509
Oh.
Good night, son.

353
00:20:14,517 --> 00:20:17,607
- Oh, seed! I got you.
- Yeah?

354
00:20:17,651 --> 00:20:19,609
I found you, seed.
Look at it.

355
00:20:19,653 --> 00:20:22,264
- I coughed it out.
- Yeah. Gross. Yeah.

356
00:20:22,308 --> 00:20:25,398
Oh. I thought
you'd be happy for me.

357
00:20:25,441 --> 00:20:28,618
Uh, sure, I guess.
Sure.

358
00:20:28,662 --> 00:20:31,795
Oh.
I should eat it again.

359
00:20:31,839 --> 00:20:34,755
Then it would be funny 'cause
I didn't learn my lesson.

360
00:20:34,798 --> 00:20:36,060
No, that wouldn't be funny.

361
00:20:36,104 --> 00:20:37,540
It'd just be kind of dumb,
you know.

362
00:20:38,628 --> 00:20:40,108
Oh.

363
00:20:40,151 --> 00:20:42,937
Um...

364
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:44,982
I think-I think
I'm gonna go to bed.

365
00:20:45,026 --> 00:20:46,593
- All right.
- Yeah.

366
00:20:46,636 --> 00:20:48,421
- Uh...
- So you're gonna
stay in the room?

367
00:20:48,464 --> 00:20:50,161
- Yeah, I'm gonna go to bed
in here and...
- I-I'll stay...

368
00:20:50,205 --> 00:20:51,946
I'll stay on the...
I'll stay on the... All right.

369
00:20:51,989 --> 00:20:54,470
Good night, Frank.

370
00:20:54,514 --> 00:20:55,776
Good night, Charlie.

371
00:21:10,181 --> 00:21:11,661
Good night, Charlie.
