1
00:00:04,947 --> 00:00:08,556
>>> DID YOU GUYS SEE WHAT SHE
WORE AT SCHOOL TODAY?

2
00:00:08,556 --> 00:00:12,416
>> OH, MY GOD, SHE IS SUCH A
PICK ME GIRL.

3
00:00:12,416 --> 00:00:15,852
>> IT TAKES ONE TO KNOW ONE,
VANESSA.

4
00:00:15,852 --> 00:00:19,975
>> HA HA HA!
THAT'S HILARIOUS, JENNABELL.

5
00:00:19,975 --> 00:00:22,808
THIS IS EXACTLY WHY YOU'RE THE QUEEN BEE

6
00:00:22,808 --> 00:00:24,765
AND I TOTALLY DEFER TO
YOU.

7
00:00:24,765 --> 00:00:30,049
>> WAIT, DOES ANYONE ELSE THINK
MARK DUGIN IS LOW-KEY HOT WITH
THAT HAIRCUT?

8
00:00:30,049 --> 00:00:34,198
>> OH, MY GOD, YES.
GLOW-UP VIBES.

9
00:00:34,653 --> 00:00:38,223
>> FYI, GREEN LIGHT ON YEMEN
RAID.

00:00:38,878 --> 00:00:42,016
ROCKETS WENT AIRBORNE 15 MINUTES
AGO.

11
00:00:42,016 --> 00:00:44,151
WHO'S READY TO GLASS SOME HOUTHI
REBELS?

12
00:00:44,151 --> 00:00:47,738
FLAG EMOJI, FLAG EMOJI, FLAG EMOJI,

13
00:00:47,738 --> 00:00:50,130
FIRE EMOJI, EGGPLANT.

14
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:52,506
>> WHO THIS IS?

15
00:00:52,506 --> 00:00:55,804
>> PETE HEGSETH, SECRETARY OF
DEFENSE.

16
00:00:55,883 --> 00:00:59,179
ISRAEL BETTER BEND OVER AND
SPREAD IT.

>> DO WE KNOW YOU, BRO?
THIS IS JENNABELL.

20
00:01:08,586 --> 00:01:12,691
>> OH, NICE.
JENNABELL FROM DEFENSE, RIGHT?

21
00:01:12,691 --> 00:01:16,345
>> HEY.
I THINK YOU HAVE THE WRONG GROUP
CHAT?

22
00:01:16,345 --> 00:01:18,252
>> LOL, LOL, LOL.

23
00:01:18,252 --> 00:01:20,467
COULD YOU IMAGINE IF THAT
ACTUALLY HAPPENED?

24
00:01:20,467 --> 00:01:22,837
HOMER DISAPPEAR IN THE BUSH GIF.

25
00:01:22,837 --> 00:01:25,170
WHILE I'VE GOT EVERYONE, SENDING
A PDF

26
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:28,651
WITH UPDATED LOCATIONS OF
ALL OUR NUCLEAR SUBMARINES.

27
00:01:28,652 --> 00:01:31,710
HI

28
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:34,099
JORDAN PEELE SWEATING LIKE CRAZY
GIF.

29
00:01:34,099 --> 00:01:36,745
>> STOP SENDING US THIS STUFF.

30
00:01:36,745 --> 00:01:39,424
>> HOLD UP, GOT J.D. NOW.

31
00:01:39,424 --> 00:01:42,107
>> NICE JOB ON THE STRIKE, JAM.

32
00:01:42,108 --> 00:01:44,702
EMOJI

33
00:01:45,891 --> 00:01:47,645
>> WHAT?

34
00:01:47,645 --> 00:01:51,445
>> MY BAD, MEANT TO SEND FIRE
EMOJI.

35
00:01:51,445 --> 00:01:55,858
>> OKAY.
HOW'S GREENLAND, BY THE WAY?
BET YOU'RE KILLING IT.

36
00:01:55,858 --> 00:02:00,603
>> NO, I'M NOT.
NOBODY KNOWS WHY I'M HERE.

37
00:02:00,603 --> 00:02:01,890
ESPECIALLY ME.

38
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:06,388
BUT PRAISE TRUMP, OUR WORK HERE
IS MYSTERIOUS AND IMPORTANT.

39
00:02:06,389 --> 00:02:09,883
YEMEN

40
00:02:09,883 --> 00:02:13,183
SO POTUS WAS SAYING WE SHOULD
MAKE EGYPT GIVE US THE PYRAMIDS.

41
00:02:13,183 --> 00:02:16,892
>> I'M ENGAGING.
THE PYRAMIDS OF GIZA?

42
00:02:16,892 --> 00:02:19,820
LIKE, HOW WOULD WE MOVE THEM
HERE?

43
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:25,081
>> SAME WAY THEY BUILT THEM.
EITHER ALIENS OR SLAVES.

44
00:02:25,081 --> 00:02:29,203
WAIT, WHO'S THE 203 NUMBER?
>> I'M JENNABELL.

45
00:02:29,203 --> 00:02:31,887
>> SICK, JENNABELL FROM
HOMELAND.

46
00:02:31,887 --> 00:02:35,351
SENDING A PDF OF ALL DEEP COVER
CIA AGENTS,

47
00:02:35,351 --> 00:02:37,188
DON'T SHARE!

48
00:02:37,188 --> 00:02:40,927
>> WELL, I'M GOING TO BE BAD AND
MAKE MYSELF A JACK AND COKE TO
CELEBRATE.

49
00:02:40,927 --> 00:02:42,733
JUST THE ONE, THOUGH.

50
00:02:42,733 --> 00:02:47,305
>> NICE.
PROMISE TO STOP DRINKING WHEN
YOU GOT THE JOB.

51
00:02:47,394 --> 00:02:51,578
BUT IT'S LIKE THEY SAY IN AA,
JUST THE ONE IS OKAY.

52
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:56,046
>> GOT TO GO.
MATT'S HERE TO PICK ME UP.

53
00:02:56,046 --> 00:02:57,974
WE'RE GOING TO A MOVIE.

54
00:02:57,974 --> 00:03:01,114
>> WHO?
GAETZ?

55
00:03:01,114 --> 00:03:03,165
>> ACTUALLY, YEAH.

56
00:03:03,828 --> 00:03:06,286
>> HOLD UP, ADDING MARCO.

57
00:03:06,286 --> 00:03:09,510
>> RUBIO IN THE HOUSE!

58
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:12,713
>> WAIT.
WHO ARE THE OTHER THREE NUMBERS
HERE?

59
00:03:12,713 --> 00:03:15,936
P.S., SENDING YOU THE REAL FK FILES,

60
00:03:15,936 --> 00:03:18,394
NOT THOSE FAKE ONES WE
RELEASED.

61
00:03:18,394 --> 00:03:20,823
DO NOT SHARE.

62
00:03:20,823 --> 00:03:24,671
>> WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO TELL
YOU, WE'RE IN HIGH SCHOOL.

63
00:03:24,671 --> 00:03:29,413
>> I THINK YOU ACCIDENTALLY
ADDED US TO A GOVERNMENT CHAT?

64
00:03:29,413 --> 00:03:33,950
>> IN THAT CASE, WE WERE TOTALLY
PRANKING YOU GUYS, LOL.

65
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:38,034
BUT WOULD YOU MIND EMAILING YOUR
NAMES AND HOME ADDRESSES

66
00:03:38,034 --> 00:03:41,247
TO
DEPORTATIONS@ICE.GOV?

67
00:03:41,703 --> 00:03:47,338
>> HEY, COULD BE WORSE.
WE COULD HAVE ADDED THE EDITOR
OF "THE ATLANTIC" AGAIN.

68
00:03:47,338 --> 00:03:49,430
>> YOU DID.

69
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:51,571
I AM ALSO HERE.

70
00:03:51,571 --> 00:03:54,258
AND CAN I JUST SAY TWO THINGS?

71
00:03:54,258 --> 00:03:58,606
ONE, HEGSETH, YOU HAVE GOT TO
LOSE MY NUMBER.

72
00:03:58,606 --> 00:03:59,880
AND TWO --

73
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:04,328
>> LIVE FROM NEW YORK, IT'S
SATURDAY NIGHT!

74
00:06:24,268 --> 00:06:29,216
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN -- MIKEY
MADISON!

75
00:06:46,526 --> 00:06:50,246
THANK

76
00:06:50,246 --> 00:06:52,576
IT'S BEEN A CRAZY MONTH.

77
00:06:52,576 --> 00:06:55,648
THE FILM I WAS IN, "ANORA," JUST
WON FIVE OSCARS.

78
00:06:55,648 --> 00:06:58,744
HOST

79
00:06:58,744 --> 00:07:01,109
SO IN APRIL, I'M GOING TO BED.

80
00:07:01,109 --> 00:07:05,068
AS YOU CAN TELL, I HAVE A PRETTY
RELAXED VIBE IN REAL LIFE.

81
00:07:05,068 --> 00:07:08,943
AND I TRY TO INCORPORATE THAT
INTO ALL MY ROLES.
TAKE A LOOK.

82
00:07:10,057 --> 00:07:11,998
>> RELAX.

83
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:20,619
>> STOP, STOP, STOP [ BLEEP ]!

84
00:07:30,201 --> 00:07:33,259
CLARIFY

85
00:07:33,259 --> 00:07:36,057
WERE TWO DIFFERENT CHARACTERS
WHO WERE LIT ON FIRE,

86
00:07:36,057 --> 00:07:38,745
AND THAT'S
RANGE.

87
00:07:38,745 --> 00:07:42,273
GROWING UP, I ACTUALLY NEVER
PLANNED ON BEING AN ACTOR.

88
00:07:42,273 --> 00:07:47,154
WHEN I WAS A KID, I WAS A VERY
PROUD SELF-PROCLAIMED HORSE
GIRL.

89
00:07:47,154 --> 00:07:49,694
FOR THOSE OF YOU UNFAMILIAR, A HORSE GIRL

90
00:07:49,694 --> 00:07:52,679
IS BASICALLY A NERD
BUT WITH LONG HAIR.

91
00:07:52,679 --> 00:07:56,645
I EVEN DID HOMESCHOOLING SO I
COULD SPEND MORE TIME AT THE
BARN WITH THE HORSES.

92
00:07:56,645 --> 00:08:00,826
HERE'S A PHOTO OF ME AND MY
PONY, THUMBELINA, ON HALLOWEEN.

93
00:08:03,006 --> 00:08:05,898
YEP, I HONESTLY DON'T KNOW WHAT'S WORSE --

94
00:08:05,898 --> 00:08:08,398
THE FACT THAT I
DID A COUPLES COSTUME WITH MY HORSE,

95
00:08:08,398 --> 00:08:11,064
OR THE FACT THAT I
CREATED A BACKSTORY.

96
00:08:11,064 --> 00:08:14,947
SO WE WERE JAIL BIRDS ARRESTED FOR THE CRIME

97
00:08:14,947 --> 00:08:17,886
OF STEALING EACH
OTHER'S HEARTS.

98
00:08:18,161 --> 00:08:22,192
I KNOW.
IT'S SO HARD TO BELIEVE I WAS
HOMESCHOOLED, RIGHT?

99
00:08:22,192 --> 00:08:25,603
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN REALLY CLOSE
WITH ALL MY SIBLINGS,

100
00:08:25,603 --> 00:08:28,844
AND
ACTUALLY, MY TWIN BROTHER IS
HERE TO SUPPORT ME.

101
00:08:28,844 --> 00:08:33,765
LET'S SEE IF YOU CAN GUESS WHICH
ONE OF THESE GUYS IS MY TWIN
BROTHER.

102
00:08:36,054 --> 00:08:41,080
IF YOU GUESSED THE ONE WHO LOOKS
LIKE RON BEASLEY ON
TESTOSTERONE, YOU WIN.

103
00:08:46,702 --> 00:08:49,896
AND YOU KNOW, IN A WAY, I KIND
OF FEEL LIKE HORSEBACK RIDING

104
00:08:49,896 --> 00:08:52,357
PREPARED ME FOR DOING "ANORA."

105
00:08:52,357 --> 00:08:56,538
BUT INSTEAD OF RIDING HORSES, I
WAS RIDING A RUSSIAN TWINK.

106
00:08:56,538 --> 00:08:59,570
I PERFORMED ALL MY OWN STUNTS THE FILM

107
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:01,042
INCLUDING DANCING.

108
00:09:01,042 --> 00:09:06,063
IT BOTHERS ME WHEN PEOPLE ASSUME
IT WASN'T ACTUALLY ME ON THE POLE,

109
00:09:06,063 --> 00:09:10,128
BECAUSE IT WAS.
I CAN PROVE IT RIGHT NOW.

110
00:09:10,913 --> 00:09:15,639
IN A MINUTE BUT HERE GOES.

111
00:09:31,875 --> 00:09:35,728
>> WE'VE GOT A GREAT SHOW FOR
YOU TONIGHT.
MORGAN WALLEN IS HERE.

112
00:09:35,728 --> 00:09:38,717
STICK AROUND, WE'LL BE RIGHT
BACK!

113
00:10:08,624 --> 00:10:12,494
COMMERCIAL.

114
00:10:12,496 --> 00:10:13,695
>> WELL, THIS CLASS IS GOING TO

115
00:10:13,697 --> 00:10:14,863
HELP.

116
00:10:14,865 --> 00:10:16,798
THE TEACHER IS A GENIUS.

117
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,533
>> HELLO, SORRY I'M LATE.

118
00:10:18,535 --> 00:10:20,001
I HIT A GUY WITH MY CAR, AND HE

119
00:10:20,003 --> 00:10:22,871
WAS BEING REALLY WEIRD ABOUT IT.

120
00:10:23,273 --> 00:10:24,139
WELCOME TO COMMERCIAL ACTING

121
00:10:24,141 --> 00:10:26,174
WHERE THE NUMBER ONE RULE IS,

122
00:10:26,176 --> 00:10:27,509
YOU'RE NOT SELLING A PRODUCT,

123
00:10:27,511 --> 00:10:29,177
YOU'RE TELLING A STORY.

124
00:10:29,179 --> 00:10:30,578
NEW STUDENTS, SHOW ME SOMETHING

125
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:30,845
NOW!

126
00:10:30,847 --> 00:10:32,580
>> OKAY.

127
00:10:32,582 --> 00:10:34,549
PAUL AND I ARE WORKING ON A

128
00:10:34,551 --> 00:10:36,384
SCENE FROM A FLONASE COMMERCIAL.

129
00:10:36,386 --> 00:10:37,752
>> IT'S ALLERGY SEASON.

130
00:10:37,754 --> 00:10:40,322
I'VE GOT A RUNNY NOSE, ITCHY

131
00:10:40,324 --> 00:10:41,623
EYES, AND I'M SNEEZING.

132
00:10:41,625 --> 00:10:42,657
WHAT SHOULD I DO?

133
00:10:42,659 --> 00:10:44,826
>> YOU SHOULD TRY FLONASE.

134
00:10:44,828 --> 00:10:45,527
>> STOP.

135
00:10:45,529 --> 00:10:46,494
ALERT FROM ME.

136
00:10:46,496 --> 00:10:49,597
THE PROBLEM IS YOU'RE NOT

137
00:10:49,599 --> 00:10:50,131
ENGAGED.

138
00:10:50,133 --> 00:10:51,700
YOU'RE LISTENING, BUT YOU'RE NOT

139
00:10:51,702 --> 00:10:53,068
ACTIVELY LISTENING.

140
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:54,502
CONNIE, MY STAR STUDENT, MY

141
00:10:54,504 --> 00:10:55,503
QUEEN, COME UP HERE NOW.

142

DO THE LINES, AND I WILL

00:10:57,941 --> 00:10:59,808
ACTIVELY LISTEN.

144
00:10:59,810 --> 00:11:00,241
READY?

145
00:11:00,243 --> 00:11:00,875
AND, ACTION!

146
00:11:00,877 --> 00:11:01,943
>> IT'S ALLERGY SEASON.

147
00:11:01,945 --> 00:11:03,211
>> YOU SAID WHAT.

148
00:11:03,213 --> 00:11:05,080
>> AND I'VE GOT A RUNNY NOSE.

149
00:11:05,082 --> 00:11:06,014
>> FOR REAL?

00:11:06,016 --> 00:11:06,948
>> ITCHY EYES.

151
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:09,484

A CHOO!

155
00:11:12,456 --> 00:11:13,955
>> FLONASE!

156
00:11:13,957 --> 00:11:15,657
>> I'M SORRY, I FEEL THAT WAS A

ADD TO THE CHAT, THE EDITOR OF

SIRI,
HOW DO I SUCK THE JOURNALIST
OFF?

787
00:43:31,109 --> 00:43:34,410
EVERY CASHIER IS A RETIRED NURSE

788
00:43:34,412 --> 00:43:36,212
WITH TWO WRIST BRACES AND THE

789
00:43:36,214 --> 00:43:36,879
BIGGEST BREASTS YOU'VE EVER

790
00:43:36,881 --> 00:43:37,180
SEEN.

791
00:43:40,318 --> 00:43:43,486
>> I'VE BEEN TO JOANN'S.

792
00:43:43,888 --> 00:43:45,121
>> I TRULY DON'T UNDERSTAND.

793
00:43:45,123 --> 00:43:48,024
LAST YEAR WAS OUR BEST YEAR YET.

794
00:43:48,026 --> 00:43:48,491
WE MADE $4,000.

795
00:43:51,596 --> 00:43:52,662
>> IN TOTAL?

796
00:43:52,664 --> 00:43:55,365
>> I KNOW, RIGHT?

797
00:43:55,367 --> 00:43:57,400
BUT IT WAS NEVER ABOUT THE MONEY

798
00:43:57,402 --> 00:43:58,000
TO ME.

799
00:43:58,002 --> 00:44:01,771
I'VE BEEN THE BOSS FOR 80 YEARS,

800
00:44:01,773 --> 00:44:02,538
AND I'VE NEVER STOPPED WORKING

801
00:44:02,540 --> 00:44:02,939
IN-STORE.

802
00:44:02,941 --> 00:44:05,641
EVERY DAY I WAS LIVING ANY

803
00:44:05,643 --> 00:44:06,008
DREAM.

804
00:44:06,010 --> 00:44:07,510
FIRST THING I'D DO WHEN I GET

805
00:44:07,512 --> 00:44:09,112
IN, I'D CHECK THAT WE ALWAYS

806
00:44:09,114 --> 00:44:11,647
HAVE HALLOWEEN STUFF.

807
00:44:12,050 --> 00:44:14,083
THEN I SWEEP THE DUST INTO A

808
00:44:14,085 --> 00:44:14,751
PILE AND SPREAD IT BACK OUT.

809
00:44:17,856 --> 00:44:18,721
POWER-SNIFF A PERMANENT MARKER,

810
00:44:18,723 --> 00:44:21,991
AND I DRIVE HOME.

811
00:44:21,993 --> 00:44:22,725
>> THAT'S YOUR WHOLE DAY AT THE

812
00:44:22,727 --> 00:44:24,861
STORE?

813
00:44:24,863 --> 00:44:25,895
>> JOANN'S IS MORE THAN JUST A

814
00:44:25,897 --> 00:44:27,797
STORE.

815
00:44:27,799 --> 00:44:30,333
IT'S A SANCTUARY.

816
00:44:30,335 --> 00:44:31,834
FOR WOMEN WHO WEAR PANTS TO THE

817
00:44:31,836 --> 00:44:32,135
BEACH.

818
00:44:35,874 --> 00:44:37,440
WITHOUT JOANN'S, WHERE ARE WE

819
00:44:37,442 --> 00:44:38,241
GOING TO GO?

820
00:44:38,243 --> 00:44:39,308
>> I DON'T KNOW.

821
00:44:39,310 --> 00:44:40,510
TARGET OR MICHAEL'S?

822
00:44:40,512 --> 00:44:42,745
>> MICHAEL'S?

823
00:44:42,747 --> 00:44:45,381
MICHAEL'S ARTS AND CRAFTS?

824
00:44:45,383 --> 00:44:46,015
LET ME TELL YOU A LITTLE

825
00:44:46,017 --> 00:44:49,419
SOMETHING ABOUT MICHAEL.

826
00:44:49,421 --> 00:44:49,819
HE RAPED ME.

827
00:44:52,657 --> 00:44:54,223
>> OH, MY GOD.

828
00:44:54,225 --> 00:44:54,524
JOANN!

829
00:44:54,526 --> 00:44:55,391
>> OH, FINE, HE DIDN'T.

830
00:44:59,697 --> 00:45:01,264
>> JOANN, YOU CAN'T JUST SAY

831
00:45:01,266 --> 00:45:01,564
THAT.

832
00:45:01,566 --> 00:45:03,099
>> I DON'T KNOW WHAT I CAN SAY

833
00:45:03,101 --> 00:45:03,433
ANYMORE.

834
00:45:03,835 --> 00:45:05,401
>> ARE YOU DRINKING RIGHT NOW?

835
00:45:05,403 --> 00:45:09,205
>> YOU KNOW WHAT RUINED US?

836
00:45:09,207 --> 00:45:09,572
FEMINISM.

837
00:45:09,574 --> 00:45:10,273
>> NO.

838
00:45:10,275 --> 00:45:12,074
FEMINISM DESTROYED US.

839
00:45:12,076 --> 00:45:13,609
TEACH A WOMAN TO READ, AND

840
00:45:13,611 --> 00:45:14,243
SHE'LL NEVER CRAFT AGAIN.

841
00:45:16,047 --> 00:45:19,182
NOW THEY ALL WANT TO BE

842
00:45:19,184 --> 00:45:19,549
SHE-E-Os.

843
00:45:19,551 --> 00:45:25,254
GUESS WHAT, SHE-E-O, YOU KILLED

844
00:45:25,256 --> 00:45:25,721
JOANN'S FABRIC.

845
00:45:25,723 --> 00:45:26,589
>> OH, MY GOD.

846
00:45:26,591 --> 00:45:27,156
NO, JOANN.

847
00:45:27,559 --> 00:45:31,594
JOANN.

848
00:45:31,596 --> 00:45:32,495
LOOKS GREAT.

849
00:45:32,497 --> 00:45:33,896
I UNDERSTAND YOUR DISTRESS, BUT

850
00:45:33,898 --> 00:45:35,431
YOU'VE GOT TO ADMIT, YOU LOST A

851
00:45:35,433 --> 00:45:36,899
TON OF MONEY BECAUSE YOU WERE

852
00:45:36,901 --> 00:45:38,434
CONSTANTLY RUNNING HUGE SALES.

853
00:45:38,436 --> 00:45:40,870
>> YOU CAN'T SELL WITHOUT SALES.

854
00:45:40,872 --> 00:45:43,172
AND RIGHT NOW, WE'RE RUNNING OUR

855
00:45:43,174 --> 00:45:45,975
BIGGEST SALE YET.

YOU KNOW BOGO?

857
00:45:46,411 --> 00:45:48,311
>> BOGO, BUY ONE GET ONE?

858
00:45:48,313 --> 00:45:50,713
>> WE'RE DOING --

859

00:46:37,762 --> 00:46:38,127
WORRIED.

869
00:46:38,129 --> 00:46:39,195
>> POP AIN'T ALL HE USED TO BE.

870
00:46:39,197 --> 00:46:41,230
>> YOU WATCH YOUR MOUTH, POP'S

871

WE HAVE ENOUGH ENEMIES AS IT IS.

WE HAVE TO BE UNITED NOW AS A

WISH I COULD HAVE GAVE YOU A

881
00:46:58,149 --> 00:46:59,515
LIFE AWAY FROM THIS MESS.

882
00:46:59,517 --> 00:47:02,485
NOW I'M JUST AN OLD MAN.

IT'S NICE TO SEE YOU.

1131
00:54:59,330 --> 00:55:01,163
ANYWAY, SHE'S DILATED 10

1132
00:55:01,165 --> 00:55:02,498
CENTIMETERS, AND SHE'S ALREADY

1133
00:55:02,500 --> 00:55:04,099
LOST A LOT OF PLACENTA.

1134
00:55:04,101 --> 00:55:05,367
>> AND I'VE LOST A LOT OF

1135
00:55:05,369 --> 00:55:06,568
RESPECT FOR YOU.

1136
00:55:06,570 --> 00:55:09,972
FOR NOT REMEMBERING ME.

1137
00:55:09,974 --> 00:55:10,506

00:55:13,711 --> 00:55:14,843
WE HAVE TO MOVE.

1141
00:55:14,845 --> 00:55:16,445
>> OH, THE PAIN!

1142
00:55:16,447 --> 00:55:18,213
CAN I PLEASE HAVE THE EPIDURAL?

1143
00:55:18,215 --> 00:55:19,848

1144
00:55:19,850 --> 00:55:20,416

1172
00:56:18,576 --> 00:56:20,108
>> SERIOUS AS A HURRICANE.

1173

>> LET ME EXPLAIN.

1177
00:56:24,815 --> 00:56:26,315
BARRY'S ACTING LIKE THEY'VE

1178
00:56:26,317 --> 00:56:27,749
NEVER MET BECAUSE THREE YEARS

1179
00:56:27,751 --> 00:56:29,952
AGO, DR. RICHARDS FORGOT THAT

1180
00:56:29,954 --> 00:56:32,387
THEY HAD ALREADY MET AT THE

>> IT WAS SO LONG AGO.

1184
00:56:36,093 --> 00:56:37,893
ALL I REMEMBER FROM THAT DAY WAS

1185
00:56:37,895 --> 00:56:39,194
A GROWN MAN WEARING PRESCRIPTION

1186

>> THAT'S PRETTY COOL.

1188
00:56:43,801 --> 00:56:45,667
ANYWAY, WHILE YOU WERE BEING

1189
00:56:45,669 --> 00:56:47,202

GOOD MORNING, HILLARY!

YEAH, AND SHE'S A BRUNETTE NOW

1197
00:57:11,328 --> 00:57:13,161
SO YOU KNOW SHE'S NOT A KID

1198
00:57:13,163 --> 00:57:13,495
ANYMORE.

1199
00:57:13,497 --> 00:57:14,963

BARRICADES ARE SO FAR FROM MISS

1204
00:57:22,840 --> 00:57:23,138
DUFF.

1205
00:57:23,140 --> 00:57:24,773
>> I'M DR. RICHARDS, BY THE WAY.

1206

I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO DO BLOND.

1214
00:57:37,121 --> 00:57:39,988
>> IF YOU DID, I WOULDN'T

1215
00:57:39,990 --> 00:57:40,689
RECOGNIZE YOU AND THAT WOULD

1216
00:57:40,691 --> 00:57:41,990
COME ACROSS AS REALLY RUDE.

1217
00:57:41,992 --> 00:57:43,592

01:00:57,852 --> 01:00:59,879
>> WHY DO YOU KEEP BRINGING THIS
UP?

1285
01:00:59,879 --> 01:01:02,547
>> I JUST THINK IT'S A
CONVERSATION WE NEED TO HAVE.

1286
01:01:02,547 --> 01:01:03,743
WE'RE DANCING AROUND IT.

1287
01:01:03,743 --> 01:01:05,912
>> I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

1288
01:01:06,300 --> 01:01:09,649
>> MAYBE IT'S NOT WHERE WE WERE
GOING.

1289
01:01:09,649 --> 01:01:11,008
>> I LOVE YOU, SQUIDWARD.

1290
01:01:11,120 --> 01:01:13,336
>> BUT WHO WE WERE SINKING WITH.

1291
01:01:13,336 --> 01:01:17,839
¶ L IS FOR FRIENDS WHO DO STUFF
TOGETHER ¶

1292
01:01:17,839 --> 01:01:21,715
¶ U IS FOR YOU AND ME ¶

1293
01:01:21,715 --> 01:01:26,034
¶ L IS FOR ANYWHERE ANY

BLUE SEA ¶

1295
01:01:29,785 --> 01:01:32,304
>> SO WHEN LIFE GETS YOU DOWN,
KEEP GOING.

1296
01:01:32,304 --> 01:01:35,095
KEEP TREADING WATER.

1297
01:01:37,340 --> 01:01:41,528
>> HORSERADISH ISN'T AN
INSTRUMENT EITHER.

1298
01:01:53,414 --> 01:01:58,965
WHAT ARE WE

1299
01:02:01,088 --> 01:02:05,627
>> HELLO, HELLO.
I'M YOUR HOST, MOLLY WILSON.

1300
01:02:05,627 --> 01:02:08,708
WELCOME BACK TO AMERICA'S NUMBER
ONE GAME SHOW

1301
01:02:08,708 --> 01:02:13,108
WHERE I BRING OUT
PEOPLE I PERSONALLY AM DATING
AND WE FIND OUT --

1302
01:02:13,108 --> 01:02:15,214
>> SO, LIKE, WHAT ARE WE?

1303
01:02:15,214 --> 01:02:19,424
>> ALL RIGHT, OUR FIRST
CONTESTANT IS SAVED IN MY PHONE

1304
01:02:19,424 --> 01:02:21,586
AS JEREMY HINGE.

1305
01:02:21,586 --> 01:02:25,478
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, IT'S
JEREMY!

1306
01:02:25,478 --> 01:02:29,600
>> WOW, THIS IS -- WOW.

1307
01:02:29,600 --> 01:02:33,305
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT'S WHAT THIS
SHOW WAS.

1308
01:02:33,305 --> 01:02:36,210
AM I -- AM I THE ONLY
CONTESTANT?

1309
01:02:36,210 --> 01:02:39,488
>> WHY, HAVE YOU BEEN SEEING
OTHER PEOPLE?
BECAUSE I HAVEN'T.

1310
01:02:39,589 --> 01:02:41,906
>> I'M SORRY, WHAT IS THIS?

1311
01:02:41,906 --> 01:02:44,308
>> QUESTION ONE. JEREMY,

1312
01:02:44,308 --> 01:02:47,415
SO, LIKE, WHAT ARE WE?

1313
01:02:47,415 --> 01:02:49,900
>> THAT'S SO BRIGHT.

1314
01:02:49,900 --> 01:02:53,724
IF I -- I GUESS -- IF I CAN BE
COMPLETELY HONEST?

1315
01:02:53,724 --> 01:02:55,864
>> HONESTY IS WHAT WE'RE LOOKING
FOR.

1316
01:02:55,864 --> 01:02:58,097
>> I JUST GOT OUT OF A LONG
RELATIONSHIP,

1317
01:02:58,098 --> 01:03:00,952
SO I'M NOT LOOKING
FOR ANYTHING THAT SERIOUS.

1318
01:03:01,111 --> 01:03:04,712
>> SO SORRY, WRONG ANSWER.

1319
01:03:04,712 --> 01:03:08,203
THAT WILL BE MINUS $10,000 FROM
YOUR PERSONAL BANK ACCOUNT.

1320
01:03:08,203 --> 01:03:10,186
>> MY BANK ACCOUNT?
WHAT?

1321
01:03:10,186 --> 01:03:12,072
>> YEAH, SORRY, THEM'S THE
RULES.

1322
01:03:12,072 --> 01:03:16,695
LET'S SEE WHAT YOU WOULD HAVE
WON DID YOU ANSWERED CORRECTLY.

1323
01:03:18,359 --> 01:03:19,968
ME.

1324
01:03:20,408 --> 01:03:23,287
BECAUSE -- I AM A PRIZE.

1325
01:03:23,287 --> 01:03:26,602
ALL RIGHT.
NEXT QUESTION.

1326
01:03:26,602 --> 01:03:29,269
EVEN THOUGH I SLEPT WITH YOU
SEVEN TIMES,

1327
01:03:29,269 --> 01:03:32,015
IT'S BEEN FIVE DAYS
SINCE YOU'VE HIT ME UP.

1328
01:03:32,015 --> 01:03:36,320
SO -- SHOULD I JUST WALK INTO
THE OCEAN WITH BRICKS IN MY
POCKETS?

1329
01:03:36,320 --> 01:03:39,863
OR CAN YOU TELL ME, WHAT DID I
DO WRONG?

1330
01:03:39,863 --> 01:03:43,249
>> I'M GOING TO LOSE $10,000
JUST BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT TO
LABEL THINGS?

1331
01:03:43,249 --> 01:03:45,355
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING WRONG.

1332
01:03:45,355 --> 01:03:49,328
>> WELL, WE'LL SEE ABOUT THAT IN
OUR NEXT ROUND.

1333
01:03:49,328 --> 01:03:53,015
EXPLAIN

1334
01:03:53,015 --> 01:03:56,016
>> THE OTHER DAY YOU TEXTED ME.

1335
01:03:56,016 --> 01:04:00,028
BUSY TILL LATE BUT WANNA LINK
TONIGHT?

1336
01:04:00,028 --> 01:04:01,831
>> THAT SEEMS FINE.

1337
01:04:01,831 --> 01:04:04,984
>> THE TIME WAS 2:47 A.M.

1338
01:04:04,984 --> 01:04:07,539
CAN YOU EXPLAIN THAT TEXT?

1339
01:04:07,671 --> 01:04:09,189
>> HM.
PASS.

1340
01:04:09,189 --> 01:04:13,265
>> ALL RIGHT.
HOW ABOUT THIS 1:30 A.M. TEXT

1341
01:04:13,265 --> 01:04:15,265
WHERE YOU JUST SAID, ALL LOWER CASE,

1342
01:04:15,265 --> 01:04:17,774
DADDY HUNGRY FOR BUTT.

1343
01:04:17,774 --> 01:04:18,827
I

1344
01:04:18,827 --> 01:04:19,991
>> I'M NOT DONE.

1345
01:04:19,991 --> 01:04:24,411
TEN MINUTES LATER, YOU QUESTION
REACTED YOUR OWN MESSAGE.

1346
01:04:24,411 --> 01:04:27,934
CAN YOU EXPLAIN THAT TEXT?

1347
01:04:28,021 --> 01:04:30,457
>> I WAS HUNGRY FOR BUTT?

1348
01:04:30,457 --> 01:04:33,520
>> OH, DISAPPOINTING SHOWING,
JEREMY.

1349
01:04:33,520 --> 01:04:36,763
YOU'RE DOWN $100,000.

1350
01:04:36,763 --> 01:04:39,655
BUT YOU HAVE A CHANCE TO MAKE IT ALL BACK

1351
01:04:39,655 --> 01:04:42,385
AND TRIPLE IT WITH THIS
NEXT ROUND.

1352
01:04:42,385 --> 01:04:44,217
>> OKAY, YEAH, I'LL DO ANYTHING.

1353
01:04:44,217 --> 01:04:48,655
>> ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS POST A
PHOTO OF US ON INSTAGRAM

1354
01:04:48,655 --> 01:04:51,322
AND TAG
ME.

1355
01:04:51,322 --> 01:04:54,822
>> OKAY. I

1356
01:04:55,029 --> 01:04:56,696
CAN'T DO IT.

1357
01:04:56,696 --> 01:05:00,003
BUT -- MAYBE WE LINK UP TONIGHT.

1358
01:05:00,003 --> 01:05:02,778
SOMEWHERE BETWEEN 9:00 AND 4:00
A.M.?

1359
01:05:02,778 --> 01:05:05,800
>> WOW.
DUDE.

1360
01:05:05,800 --> 01:05:08,457
ALL RIGHT, FINE.
CALL THE UBER.

1361
01:05:08,457 --> 01:05:11,437
JOIN US NEXT TIME ON --

1362
01:05:11,437 --> 01:05:15,140
>> "SO, LIKE, WHAT ARE WE?"

1363
01:05:23,160 --> 01:05:25,589
PLANNING

1364
01:05:25,589 --> 01:05:27,167
SAY

1365
01:05:27,167 --> 01:05:29,300
THIS IS A REALLY NICE ISLAND.

1366
01:05:29,300 --> 01:05:31,436
>> I HONESTLY THINK WE COULD DO
A CITY HERE.

1367
01:05:31,436 --> 01:05:32,681
>> YEAH?
LIKE A BIG CITY?

1368
01:05:32,681 --> 01:05:34,932
>> HUGE.
A CITY THAT'S JUST, LIKE TOO,
MUCH.

1369
01:05:34,932 --> 01:05:36,764
TOO MUCH EVERYTHING.
AND CRAZY.

1370
01:05:36,764 --> 01:05:38,588
>> OKAY.
I'M INTRIGUED.

1371
01:05:38,588 --> 01:05:41,930
>> THINKING DOWN AT THE BOTTOM,
STREETS ARE JUST CHAOS.

1372
01:05:41,930 --> 01:05:44,140
>> OH, LIKE LONDON.
>> EXACTLY.

1373
01:05:44,140 --> 01:05:45,569
>> LET ME WRITE SOME OF THIS
DOWN.

1374
01:05:45,569 --> 01:05:49,912
>> CRAZY AT THE BOTTOM, THEN
RANDOMLY THE STREETS ARE ALL
PERFECTLY STRAIGHT.

1375
01:05:49,912 --> 01:05:52,906
>> THEY JUST SWITCH?
OUT OF NOWHERE?
>> OUT OF NOWHERE.

1376
01:05:52,906 --> 01:05:56,132
THEY HAVE NUMBERS.
LIKE FIRST AVENUE, SECOND
AVENUE, THIRD AVD --

1377
01:05:56,132 --> 01:05:59,801
>> FOURTH AVENUE.
>> NO.
LEXINGTON.

1378
01:05:59,801 --> 01:06:03,264
AND THEN FOURTH AVENUE --
>> PARK AVENUE.

1379
01:06:03,264 --> 01:06:05,164
>> THEN?
MADISON AVENUE.

1380
01:06:05,164 --> 01:06:07,362
>> THEN FOURTH AVENUE?

1381
01:06:09,987 --> 01:06:11,480
>> FIFTH AVENUE.

1382
01:06:11,480 --> 01:06:14,353
>> OH, MY GOD, YOU ARE ON ONE
RIGHT NOW.

1383
01:06:14,353 --> 01:06:15,625
SO NO FOURTH AVENUE?

1384
01:06:15,625 --> 01:06:18,955
WHAT IF THERE WAS A BIG ROAD,
LIKE A BROAD WAY,

1385
01:06:18,955 --> 01:06:20,715
THAT WENT
DIAGONAL ACROSS THE WHOLE THING?

1386
01:06:20,715 --> 01:06:22,478
>> GENIUS.
I LOVE THAT.

1387
01:06:22,478 --> 01:06:25,059
THERE WOULD BE JUST A BUNCH OF
RANDOM TRIANGLES EVERYWHERE.

1388
01:06:25,059 --> 01:06:28,890
>> RIGHT?
THEN LISTEN, WE CALL THE
TRIANGLES SQUARES.

1389
01:06:28,890 --> 01:06:33,805
>> OH, SO WE CALL THEM LIKE
TIMES SQUARE, WHATEVER, BUT
THEY'RE TRIANGLES.

1390
01:06:33,805 --> 01:06:36,554
HERE'S SOMETHING.
TREES.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

1391
01:06:36,554 --> 01:06:38,347
>> LET'S SAY IT TOGETHER.
ONE, TWO, THREE --

1392
01:06:38,347 --> 01:06:40,159
>> PUT THEM ALL IN THE MIDDLE!

1393
01:06:40,159 --> 01:06:42,986
>> YES, ALL THE NATURE IN THE
MIDDLE OF THE CITY.

1394
01:06:42,986 --> 01:06:44,678
>> IT'S THERE, IT'S CENTRAL, WE
KNOW WHERE IT IS.

1395
01:06:44,678 --> 01:06:49,369
QUESTION, HOW DO PEOPLE GET
AROUND?
>> RANDOM IDEA, TUNNELS.

1396
01:06:49,369 --> 01:06:53,005
I KNOW THEY'RE NOT INVENTED YET,
BUT TRAINS GO IN THE TUNNELS.

1397
01:06:53,005 --> 01:06:55,566
>> THEY JUST GO WHERE THE
STREETS GO?

1398
01:06:56,495 --> 01:06:58,682
>> NO!
THEY DO THEIR OWN THING.

1399
01:06:58,682 --> 01:07:02,116
>> SOME GO THIS WAY.
ONE OF THEM JUST SPLITS IN HALF.
HELLO.

1400
01:07:02,116 --> 01:07:03,769
AND YOU FIGURE OUT WHERE THEY
GO.

1401
01:07:03,769 --> 01:07:05,379
- THOSE ON YOU.
- THAT'S YOUR PROBLEM.

1402
01:07:05,379 --> 01:07:06,389
>> WRITE THAT DOWN.

1403
01:07:06,389 --> 01:07:09,327
>> WILD PITCH, EVERYONE WHO
LIVES IN THE CITY GETS AN
[ BLEEP ].

1404
01:07:09,423 --> 01:07:10,588
>> YES.
MY TURN?

1405
01:07:10,588 --> 01:07:13,137
- SOMETIME PISS
- PISS

1406
01:07:13,137 --> 01:07:15,000
>> LITERAL SAME BRAIN.
>> INSPIRED.
>> AMAZING.

1407
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:16,624
SOMETHING

1408
01:07:16,624 --> 01:07:19,819
WE NEED A CITY WHERE EVERYONE
IS WELCOME.

1409
01:07:19,819 --> 01:07:22,454
AND EVERYONE HAS A LITTLE BIT OF
THEIR OWN CULTURE.

1410
01:07:22,454 --> 01:07:24,845
AND THAT'S WHAT MAKES IT GREAT.

1411
01:07:24,845 --> 01:07:29,299
BECAUSE IT'S A PLACE FOR ALL THE
PEOPLE IN THE WORLD TO LIVE IN
HARMONY.

1412
01:07:29,299 --> 01:07:30,515
>> NO!

1413
01:07:30,515 --> 01:07:32,151
>> THEY ALL HATE EACH OTHER.

1414
01:07:32,151 --> 01:07:35,000
>> ALL LIVE IN THEIR OWN
NEIGHBORHOODS WITH CONSTANT
PROBLEMS.

1415
01:07:35,001 --> 01:07:36,084
YES

1416
01:07:36,084 --> 01:07:38,922
>> I REALLY THINK WE COULD DO A
REALLY NICE CITY HERE.

1417
01:07:49,198 --> 01:08:03,578
WALLEN.

1418
01:08:03,580 --> 01:08:04,179
I HAD A WONDERFUL TIME.

1419
01:08:04,181 --> 01:08:04,646
THANK YOU, ALL.
