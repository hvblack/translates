1
00:00:01,755 --> 00:00:04,926
>>> YOU'RE WATCHING "FOX &
FRIENDS."

2
00:00:08,859 --> 00:00:13,760
>> GOOD MORNING VIETNAM!

3
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:17,238
WELCOME TO "FOX & FRIENDS."
THAT'S BRIAN KILMEADE.
>> HELLO!

4
00:00:17,238 --> 00:00:19,066
>> AND THE AINSLEY EARNHARDT.

5
00:00:19,066 --> 00:00:21,920
>> OKAY.
Y'ALL ARE GOING TO KILL ME WITH
THESE JOKES.

6
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:27,207
>> AND I'M STEVE DOOCY HERE ON
THIS GORGEOUS 30 DEGREE SPRING
NEW YORK MORNING.

7
00:00:27,207 --> 00:00:29,327
WHAT A HELLHOLE OF A CITY.

8
00:00:29,327 --> 00:00:31,107
BRIAN, HOW WAS THE WEEKEND?

9
00:00:31,107 --> 00:00:35,150
>> OH, VERY EXCITING, STEVE.
I GOT ON TRUTH SOCIAL.

10
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:39,086
>> OOH.
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S EXCLUSIVE NEW
SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORM?

11
00:00:39,086 --> 00:00:42,392
>> FANCY.
WHAT'S IT LIKE?
>> YOU KNOW, IT'S FUNNY.

12
00:00:42,392 --> 00:00:44,672
I DOWNLOADED THE APP, OPENED IT,

13
00:00:44,672 --> 00:00:48,736
AND MY PHONE IMMEDIATELY GOT
VERY, VERY HOT.

14
00:00:48,736 --> 00:00:52,122
LIKE OVER 140 DEGREES.

15
00:00:52,122 --> 00:00:53,935
>> WOW.
JUST FROM THE APP?

16
00:00:53,935 --> 00:00:56,696
>> YEAH.
IT BURNED MY SON, ACTUALLY.

17
00:00:56,696 --> 00:00:59,097
ANYWAY, TRUTH SOCIAL, FIVE
STARS.

18
00:00:59,097 --> 00:01:01,775
>> OKAY.
GUYS, SPEAKING OF TRUTHS

19
00:01:01,775 --> 00:01:03,898
CRUSH
OF THE WEEK, TED CRUZ.

20
00:01:03,898 --> 00:01:08,455
ABSOLUTELY WIPED THE FLOOR WITH
KETANJI BROWN JACKSON LAST WEEK

21
00:01:08,455 --> 00:01:10,731
BY WAVING A CHILDREN'S BOOK AT
HER.

22
00:01:10,731 --> 00:01:13,466
>> SO POWERFUL.
>> FATALITY.

23
00:01:13,466 --> 00:01:18,644
>> I'M SORRY, MS. JACKSON, BUT I
AM FO THE FIRST AMENDMENT.
- YES.

24
00:01:18,644 --> 00:01:22,512
>> WELL, HERE TO TALK ABOUT THAT
AND THE SUPREME COURT

25
00:01:22,512 --> 00:01:26,904
ARE TWO FRIENDS OF OURS.
HANDLING THEIR OWN LITTLE
CONTROVERSY THIS WEEK,

26
00:01:26,904 --> 00:01:30,709
JUSTICE
CLARENCE AND GINNI THOMAS.

27
00:01:39,193 --> 00:01:41,425
>> ALL RIGHT.
>> HI, FRIENDS.

28
00:01:41,425 --> 00:01:47,681
>> WELL, FIRST OFF, HONORABLE
JUSTICE THOMAS, YOU WERE JUST IN
THE HOSPITAL.
IS THAT RIGHT?

29
00:01:48,009 --> 00:01:50,314
>> THAT'S WHAT THEY SAY.

30
00:01:50,314 --> 00:01:55,187
>> YEAH.
SO WHAT'S GOING ON?
YOU FEELING OKAY?

31
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:58,570
>> I GUESS WE'LL SEE.

32
00:01:58,570 --> 00:02:04,921
>> YEAH.
FOLKS WERE SAYING YOU HAD COVID.
BUT NOT TRUE, THOUGH, RIGHT,
JUSTICE T?

33
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,961
EVERYTHING'S POSSIBLE.

34
00:02:08,961 --> 00:02:13,901
>> JUSTICE THOMAS, ALWAYS
PLAYING IT CLOSE TO THE VEST.
I RESPECT THAT.

35
00:02:13,901 --> 00:02:17,251
NOW, GINNI, THE LEFT IS CURRENTLY
LOSING THEIR MINDS

36
00:02:17,251 --> 00:02:20,252
OVER A
COUPLE OF COMPLETELY NORMAL TEXTS

37
00:02:20,252 --> 00:02:24,960
YOU SENT TO YOUR PAL MARK
MEADOWS ON JANUARY 6th.
IS THAT RIGHT?

38
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:27,295
>> IT SURE IS.

39
00:02:27,295 --> 00:02:31,231
>> AND NOW THEY WANT THE
HONORABLE JUSTICE TO RECUSE
HIMSELF.

40
00:02:31,231 --> 00:02:33,611
I MEAN, YOU'RE ALLOWED TO SPEAK
YOUR MIND.

41
00:02:33,611 --> 00:02:36,222
>> YES.
AND I DON'T WANT ANY TROUBLE.

42
00:02:36,222 --> 00:02:41,785
I TAKE MY DUTY AS THE YOKO ONO
OF THE SUPREME COURT VERY
SERIOUSLY.

43
00:02:41,785 --> 00:02:46,096
ALL I WANT IS A TIDAL WAVE OF
BIBLICAL VENGEANCE

44
00:02:46,096 --> 00:02:49,655
TO WASH AWAY
THE BIDEN CRIME FAMILY ALL THE
WAY TO GITMO

45
00:02:49,655 --> 00:02:53,026
AND THEN WE RELEASE
THE KRAKEN.

46
00:02:53,497 --> 00:02:56,481
>> OKAY.
WELL, THAT IS TERRIFIC.

47
00:02:56,481 --> 00:03:01,165
>> JUSTICE THOMAS, SHE DOESN'T
TALK TO YOU ABOUT THIS STUFF,
THOUGH, RIGHT?

48
00:03:03,026 --> 00:03:05,670
SOME SAY YES, SOME SAY NO.

49
00:03:06,393 --> 00:03:09,575
>> WELL, JUSTICE T, IT'S SO
GREAT TO HAVE SOMEONE HERE

50
00:03:09,575 --> 00:03:12,276
WHO
ISN'T AFRAID TO TELL US WHAT HE
REALLY THINKS.

51
00:03:12,276 --> 00:03:14,146
>> WHO?

52
00:03:14,607 --> 00:03:17,671
>> WELL, YOU OF COURSE, SIR.

53
00:03:17,911 --> 00:03:20,319
YOU CRAZY, MAN.

54
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:24,217
>> WELL, GREAT.
THANK YOU BOTH SO MUCH.

55
00:03:24,217 --> 00:03:27,716
NOW, LATER THIS AFTERNOON ON
FOX, IT'S "THE FIVE."

56
00:03:27,716 --> 00:03:33,135
LET'S CHECK IN WITH CO-HOST
JUDGE JEANINE PIRRO TO SEE
WHAT'S IN STORE.

57
00:03:33,135 --> 00:03:36,733
>> HELLO, MY ONLY FRIENDS.

58
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:44,960
LATER ON "THE FIVE," DISNEY HAS
AN EXCITING NEW PROJECT.

59
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:47,732
TURNING YOUR KINDERGARTNER GAY.

60
00:03:47,732 --> 00:03:53,748
LAST WEEK GOVERNOR DeSANTIS
SIGNED A BILL PROTECTING OUR
PRECIOUS FLORIDA SCHOOLS

61
00:03:53,748 --> 00:03:56,982
FROM
AMERICA'S DANGEROUS ELLENS AND
CAITLYNS.

62
00:03:56,982 --> 00:04:01,561
BY THE WAY, CAITLYN JENNER,
WELCOME TO THE FOX NEWS FAMILY.

63
00:04:01,561 --> 00:04:05,489
NOW, WOKE DISNEY WON'T STOP
UNTIL ALL OF DISNEY WORLD

64
00:04:05,489 --> 00:04:08,759
IS PACKED WITH TWINKERBELLS,
CINDERFELLAS

65
00:04:08,759 --> 00:04:11,008
AND THAT GAY MR.
TOAD.

66
00:04:11,008 --> 00:04:14,463
THEN REPRESENTATIVE MADISON
CAWTHORN.

67
00:04:14,463 --> 00:04:18,605
OH, MADISON.
YOU HAD ME AT WHITE SUPREMACY.

68
00:04:18,605 --> 00:04:20,520
YOU LOST ME AT ORGY.

69
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:24,750
ALL THAT AND KYLE RITTENHOUSE
DEBUTS HIS NEW COOKBOOK,

70
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:27,006
COMING
UP ON "THE FIVE."

71
00:04:27,006 --> 00:04:29,299
>> WELL, THANK YOU SO MUCH,
JUDGE.

72
00:04:29,299 --> 00:04:31,207
THAT SOUNDS TERRIFIC AS ALWAYS.

73
00:04:31,207 --> 00:04:34,809
>> YOU BET.
SALUD.

74
00:04:41,194 --> 00:04:43,236
>> LOVE THAT.

75
00:04:43,236 --> 00:04:45,465
NOW, THIS IS EXCITING.

76
00:04:45,465 --> 00:04:49,532
I'M HEARING WE ACTUALLY HAVE A
SURPRISE ON THE LINE.
AM I CORRECT?

77
00:04:49,532 --> 00:04:52,005
>> UH-OH.
IS HE HERE?
HELLO?

78
00:04:52,005 --> 00:04:54,530
MR. PRESIDENT, ARE YOU ON THE
FACE-TIME?

79
00:04:54,530 --> 00:04:58,093
>> IF YOU BUILD IT, I WILL COME.
HELLO, FRIENDS.
CAN YOU SEE ME?

80
00:04:58,093 --> 00:05:00,903
>> MR. PRESIDENT.
WOW.
WHAT A TREAT.

81
00:05:00,903 --> 00:05:02,965
THANKS FOR FITTING US INTO YOUR
BUSY SCHEDULE.

82
00:05:03,054 --> 00:05:06,477
>> VERY BUSY, STEVE.
HERE AT MAR-A-LAGO WITH THE GOLF

83
00:05:06,477 --> 00:05:11,824
AND THE WEDDING RECEPTIONS AND
GETTING CLUMPS OF BACON WITH
TONGS AT BREAKFAST BAR.

84
00:05:11,824 --> 00:05:14,974
>> WELL, SO MUCH TO DISCUSS,

85
00:05:14,974 --> 00:05:19,184
BUT I'VE GOT TO ASK, SIR, DID YOU
SEE THE FAMOUS SLAP?

86
00:05:19,184 --> 00:05:21,422
>> YOU KNOW, I DID SEE SLAP.
I ENJOYED SLAP.

87
00:05:21,422 --> 00:05:24,717
I WAS VERY IMPRESSED BY HITCH.

88
00:05:24,717 --> 00:05:29,362
QUITE AN ARM ON HITCH.
I ALWAYS KNEW HITCH HAD AN ARM.

89
00:05:29,362 --> 00:05:32,244
BACK IN "PURSUIT OF HAPPYNESS,"

90
00:05:32,244 --> 00:05:37,355
HE'S LUGGING THE MACHINE ON AND
OFF THE SUBWAY.
I THOUGHT IT WAS GREAT.

91
00:05:37,355 --> 00:05:39,376
THEY SLEPT IN THE BATHROOM IN
THAT MOVIE.

92
00:05:39,376 --> 00:05:41,793
IT'S SO SAD.
IT'S SO SAD.

93
00:05:41,793 --> 00:05:44,387
BUT IT'S A SAD NIGHT FOR HITCH
TOO.
VERY SAD.

94
00:05:44,387 --> 00:05:49,835
THAT KIND OF BEHAVIOR IS NOT
GOING TO HELP KEVIN JAMES GET A
DATE WITH ALLEGRA COLE.
I'LL TELL YOU THAT.

95
00:05:49,835 --> 00:05:53,211
>> ABSOLUTELY.
AMEN TO THAT, SIR.

96
00:05:53,211 --> 00:05:58,533
>> NOW, SIR, THE JANUARY 6th
COMMITTEE IS GEARING UP TO MAKE
ALL SORTS OF CLAIMS.

97
00:05:58,533 --> 00:06:02,370
SO LET'S JUST PUT THIS TO REST.
DID YOU COMMIT A COUP, SIR?

98
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:04,386
>> NO.
YOU KNOW WHAT?
THERE WAS NO COUP.

99
00:06:04,386 --> 00:06:07,586
IT WAS AN EVENT.
PERHAPS A TAKEBACK EVENT.

100
00:06:07,586 --> 00:06:09,113
A COUP PERHAPS.

101
00:06:09,113 --> 00:06:12,368
BUT I DON'T LIKE COUP.
I JUST DON'T LIKE COUP.

102
00:06:12,368 --> 00:06:13,784
I DON'T LIKE THE P AT THE END OF
COUP.

103
00:06:13,784 --> 00:06:17,885
YOU SHOULD TAKE THE P AND PUSH
IT.

104
00:06:17,885 --> 00:06:23,238
IF YOU TAKE OFF P YOU HAVE COW
WHICH GOES MOO,

105
00:06:23,238 --> 00:06:26,114
WHICH IS
PERHAPS WHERE THEY GET COUP.

106
00:06:26,114 --> 00:06:27,572
BUT COULD COUP.
WHO DO?

107
00:06:27,572 --> 00:06:29,583
YOU DO.
DO WHAT?
REMIND ME OF THE BABE.

108
00:06:29,583 --> 00:06:35,069
BUT IT WAS AN INTENTIONAL
PLANNED COUP, YES.

109
00:06:36,846 --> 00:06:38,730
>> RIGHT.
OKAY.

110
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:43,932
>> BUT THEY'RE SAYING THERE IS
THIS SEVEN-HOUR GAP IN WHITE
HOUSE CALL LOGS THAT DAY.

111
00:06:43,932 --> 00:06:46,561
YOU DIDN'T USE A BURNER PHONE,
DID YOU, SIR?

112
00:06:46,561 --> 00:06:48,825
>> NO.
NOT TRUE.
NEVER USED BURNER PHONE

113
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:53,178
EXCEPT
PERHAPS ON JANUARY 6th DURING
THAT SEVEN-HOUR PERIOD.

114
00:06:53,178 --> 00:06:56,235
I COULDN'T EVEN TELL YOU WHAT A
BURNER PHONE LOOKS LIKE,
HONESTLY.

115
00:06:56,235 --> 00:07:00,687
I WAS TOO BUSY WITH PHONE CALL
AND BURNER PHONE AND COUP.

116
00:07:01,067 --> 00:07:03,033
>> OKAY.
GOT YOU.

117
00:07:03,033 --> 00:07:07,588
BUT LET'S BE REAL, SIR.
THE LEFT WANTS TO PAINT JANUARY 6th

118
00:07:07,588 --> 00:07:10,748
AS SOME VIOLENT REVOLUTION.
IT WASN'T.

119
00:07:10,748 --> 00:07:13,254
>> COULD HAVE BEEN.
SHOULD HAVE BEEN MAYBE.

120
00:07:13,254 --> 00:07:18,441
VIOLENT IS -- VIOLENT IS PERHAPS
GOOD.
YOU KNOW, THEY USED TO DO
VIOLENT ALL THE TIME.

121
00:07:18,441 --> 00:07:23,352
YOU'D LINE UP THE OPPONENTS,
YOU'D GO BING, BING, BING,
SHOOT THEM DEAD.
SO EASY.

122
00:07:23,352 --> 00:07:26,727
SOLVE SO MANY PROBLEMS.

123
00:07:26,727 --> 00:07:31,503
YOU SHOOT THEM DEAD.
WITH A BIG FAT BEAUTIFUL
UNCIRCUMCISED GUN.

124
00:07:31,503 --> 00:07:35,125
NOW, THAT'S WHAT I CALL A COUP.

125
00:07:36,031 --> 00:07:40,742
HEY, BY THE WAY, DID YOU HEAR
THIS?
I GOT A HOLE IN ONE.
DID ANYBODY HEAR THAT?

126
00:07:40,742 --> 00:07:44,530
>> YES, YES.
CONGRATS, SIR.
PLEASE TELL US ABOUT IT.

127
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:48,855
>> YOU KNOW, I'D LOVE TO.
BUT MY PHONE IS GETTING VERY,
VERY HOT TO THE TOUCH.

128
00:07:48,855 --> 00:07:51,708
>> YOU'VE GOT TRUTH SOCIAL, SIR.

129
00:07:51,708 --> 00:07:55,906
>> YES INDEED.
TRUTH SOCIAL.
THE ONLY APP WITH A SMELL.

130
00:07:55,906 --> 00:08:00,421
>> ALL RIGHT.
THANK YOU SO MUCH, SIR.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK AND --

131
00:08:00,421 --> 00:08:04,211
>> And live from New York, it's
Saturday Night!

132
00:10:14,715 --> 00:10:20,584
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN --
JERROD CARMICHAEL!

133
00:10:42,072 --> 00:10:46,519
>> THANK YOU.
THANK YOU VERY, VERY MUCH.

134
00:10:51,867 --> 00:10:54,808
I'M NOT GOING TO TALK ABOUT IT.

135
00:10:55,428 --> 00:10:59,471
I WANT TO BE CLEAR UP TOP.

136
00:10:59,471 --> 00:11:02,315
I TALKED ABOUT IT ENOUGH.

137
00:11:02,315 --> 00:11:05,692
KEPT TALKING ABOUT IT.
KEPT THINKING ABOUT IT.

138
00:11:05,692 --> 00:11:10,059
I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT.
AND YOU CAN'T MAKE ME TALK ABOUT
IT.

139
00:11:10,059 --> 00:11:14,530
BUT -- I'VE GOT A QUESTION.
DO YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT?

140
00:11:14,530 --> 00:11:17,507
LIKE AREN'T YOU SICK OF TALKING
ABOUT IT?

141
00:11:17,507 --> 00:11:22,447
ISN'T IT KIND OF CRAZY -- IT
FEELS LIKE WE'VE BEEN TALKING
ABOUT IT FOR SO LONG. I HAVE --

142
00:11:22,523 --> 00:11:25,193
THIS IS GOING TO
REALLY BLOW YOUR MINDS.

143
00:11:25,193 --> 00:11:30,126
CAN YOU BELIEVE --
IT'S BEEN SIX DAYS.

144
00:11:30,557 --> 00:11:34,324
SIX DAYS.
THIS HAPPENED A WEEK AGO.

145
00:11:34,324 --> 00:11:37,789
DOESN'T IT FEEL LIKE IT HAPPENED
YEARS AGO?

146
00:11:37,789 --> 00:11:41,589
LIKE DOESN'T IT FEEL LIKE IT
HAPPENED WHEN WE WERE ALL IN
HIGH SCHOOL?

147
00:11:42,509 --> 00:11:49,181
LIKE IT FEELS LIKE IT HAPPENED
BETWEEN JAMIROQUAI AND 9/11.

148
00:11:50,343 --> 00:11:53,240
A LONG, LONG TIME AGO.

149
00:11:53,241 --> 00:11:57,263
ENTIRE LIVES

150
00:11:57,263 --> 00:12:00,823
IT HAPPENED ON SUNDAY.
SUNDAY.

151
00:12:00,823 --> 00:12:03,309
IT'S SATURDAY, BRO.

152
00:12:06,811 --> 00:12:09,513
ON MONDAY IT WAS EXCITING.
I'M NOT GOING TO LIE.

153
00:12:09,589 --> 00:12:12,377
MONDAY -- IF THIS WERE MONDAY,

154
00:12:12,377 --> 00:12:15,613
YOU WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO GET ME
TO SHUT UP ABOUT IT.

155
00:12:15,613 --> 00:12:18,299
I WAS TALKING ABOUT IT ALL
MONDAY.

156
00:12:18,299 --> 00:12:20,602
TUESDAY, STILL TALKING ABOUT IT.

157
00:12:20,602 --> 00:12:25,171
A LITTLE LESS EXCITING BECAUSE
IT STOPPED BEING ABOUT IT ON
TUESDAY.

158
00:12:25,171 --> 00:12:28,661
IT STARTED BEING ABOUT A LOT OF
PROXY ARGUMENTS.

159
00:12:28,661 --> 00:12:33,565
HAIR AND BLACK MEN AND WHITE
PEOPLE ON TWITTER.

160
00:12:33,565 --> 00:12:36,286
IT WAS JUST -- IT WAS TOO MUCH
BY TUESDAY.

161
00:12:36,286 --> 00:12:39,516
BY WEDNESDAY I WANTED TO KILL
MYSELF.

162
00:12:42,773 --> 00:12:44,804
I DON'T REALLY REMEMBER
THURSDAY.

163
00:12:44,804 --> 00:12:49,251
BUT BY FRIDAY, BY FRIDAY I MADE
A VOW TO MYSELF.

164
00:12:49,251 --> 00:12:54,183
I PROMISED MYSELF I WOULD NEVER,
EVER TALK ABOUT IT AGAIN.

165
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,774
THEN LORNE CAME INTO MY DRESSING
ROOM.

166
00:13:02,866 --> 00:13:07,181
HE WAS LIKE, "I THINK YOU NEED
TO TALK ABOUT IT."

167
00:13:07,181 --> 00:13:10,786
HE SAID THE NATION NEEDS TO
HEAL.

168
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:18,064
DON'T TURN YOUR BACK ON ME,
LORNE.

169
00:13:18,064 --> 00:13:22,042
THE NATION NEEDS TO HEAL.

170
00:13:22,042 --> 00:13:24,490
I SAID THE NATION NEEDS TO WHAT?

171
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:27,192
YOU WANT ME TO DO THAT?

172
00:13:27,192 --> 00:13:29,291
THE NATION DON'T EVEN KNOW ME.

173
00:13:29,291 --> 00:13:31,840
THE NATION HAS NO CLUE WHO I AM.

174
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,710
I HAVE TO BE

175
00:13:34,279 --> 00:13:37,734
THE LEAST FAMOUS
HOST

176
00:13:39,917 --> 00:13:43,527
IN "SNL" -- LIKE THE LEAST.

177
00:13:43,891 --> 00:13:47,155
I WAS SO EXCITED TO COME HERE.

178
00:13:52,727 --> 00:13:54,653
THANK YOU.
I APPRECIATE THAT.

179
00:13:54,653 --> 00:13:57,912
JUST KNOW THOSE CLAPS DID
NOTHING FOR MY SELF-ESTEEM.

180
00:13:57,913 --> 00:14:03,396
ALL YOU WERE DOING WAS -- WERE
YOU MAKING IT BETTER?

181
00:14:04,919 --> 00:14:07,925
I WAS HAPPY.
I WAS ACTUALLY REALLY HAPPY TO
COME HERE

182
00:14:07,925 --> 00:14:09,915
AND TALK TO YOU GUYS
AND INTRODUCE MYSELF.

183
00:14:09,915 --> 00:14:11,434
I'M JERROD CARMICHAEL, BY THE
WAY.

184
00:14:11,434 --> 00:14:14,564
HI, EVERYONE.
HELLO.

185
00:14:17,091 --> 00:14:20,647
I HAVE A NEW SPECIAL OUT ON HBO.

186
00:14:20,647 --> 00:14:24,917
I REALLY HOPE THAT YOU WATCH.

187
00:14:24,917 --> 00:14:28,577
IN THE SPECIAL I COME OUT AS
GAY.

188
00:14:29,865 --> 00:14:34,938
WHICH IS NICE.
BUT AN EXPECTED RESPONSE IN NEW
YORK.

189
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:39,064
IT'S ACTUALLY WHY I LIVE HERE.

190
00:14:39,064 --> 00:14:41,465
IF YOU SAY YOU'RE GAY IN NEW YORK,

191
00:14:41,465 --> 00:14:45,370
YOU CAN RIDE THE BUS FOR
FREE AND PEOPLE JUST GIVE YOU
PIZZA.

192
00:14:48,019 --> 00:14:51,230
HONESTLY, IF YOU'RE GAY AND YOU -- IN NEW YORK,

193
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:53,915
YOU GET TO
HOST "SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE."

194
00:14:54,217 --> 00:14:59,146
NO, NO.
THIS IS THE GAYEST THING YOU
COULD POSSIBLY DO.

195
00:15:00,292 --> 00:15:04,321
LIKE I CAME OUT RIGHT ONTO THE
STAGE.
I BASICALLY --

196
00:15:04,321 --> 00:15:09,209
WE'RE BASICALLY
LIKE IN OUR ANDY WARHOL FEVER
DREAM RIGHT NOW.

197
00:15:12,262 --> 00:15:16,471

198
00:15:16,471 --> 00:15:20,409
LIKE THERE'S SO MUCH GAY STUFF
I'VE GOT TO DO BEFORE I CAN HEAL
THE NATION.

199
00:15:20,409 --> 00:15:23,274
I'VE GOT SO MANY HOMOPHOBIC
COUSINS I CAN'T EVEN HEAL MY
FAMILY.

200
00:15:23,274 --> 00:15:25,289
YOU WANT ME TO HEAL THE NATION?

201
00:15:28,055 --> 00:15:31,009
I WAS EXCITED.
I WAS EXCITED TO BE HERE.

202
00:15:31,009 --> 00:15:33,853
LIKE I HAD A LOT OF THINGS
PLANNED.
STUFF I WANTED TO TALK ABOUT.

203
00:15:33,853 --> 00:15:35,282
ACTUALLY REALLY --

204
00:15:35,282 --> 00:15:38,327
WE'VE GOT TIME.
REALLY QUICK.

205
00:15:38,389 --> 00:15:41,531
I DON'T KNOW HOW OFTEN I'M EVER
GOING TO BE ON LIVE TV,

206
00:15:41,531 --> 00:15:44,276
AND I
KNOW I'LL NEVER GET TO TALK TO
HIM.
SO I HAVE TO DO THIS.

207
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:47,427
BARACK OBAMA, YOU WANT TO MEET
ME AT CAMERA 2 REALLY FAST?

208
00:15:48,184 --> 00:15:50,120
HEY, B.

214
00:16:05,811 --> 00:16:10,491
AND UNFORTUNATELY, I HAVE SOME
NEWS FOR YOU, BARACK.

215
00:16:10,491 --> 00:16:13,149
AND YOU'RE NOT GOING TO LIKE

216
00:16:14,327 --> 00:16:17,002
WE NEED YOU BACK BECAUSE I -- I

217
00:16:17,002 --> 00:16:19,908

TALK ABOUT IT.

218
00:16:19,908 --> 00:16:23,182

BIRTHDAY.

299
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:58,071

00:19:03,043 --> 00:19:06,746

308
00:19:06,746 --> 00:19:12,018

THE THING YOU DO WITH CARS.

324
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:36,910
>> TIRES.

325
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:42,949
>> NO.

326
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:42,949

00:19:54,427 --> 00:19:59,065
YOUR BRAIN AGAIN.

338
00:19:54,427 --> 00:19:59,065
DAMMIT, WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME?

340
00:19:59,065 --> 00:20:03,370
>> NO, NO.

341

I WASN'T REALLY ASKING.

342
00:19:59,065 --> 00:20:03,370
>> YOU NEVER FELT MORE ALONE?

343
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:06,706
>> STOP GUESSING.

344
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:06,706

345
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:06,706
THERAPIST BUT SHE BLOCKED YOUR

348
00:20:06,706 --> 00:20:10,477

BONUS QUESTION THAT INVOLVES A

356

MYSTERY GUEST.

357
00:20:16,783 --> 00:20:25,191
DEREK, WHO IS THIS?

358
00:20:25,191 --> 00:20:27,560
>> OH, THAT'S EASY.

359

BUT WHAT'S HIS NAME?

>> I KNOW IT'S SOMETHING REGULAR

368
00:20:37,637 --> 00:20:43,343
LIKE GREG OR -- STEVE, RIGHT?

369
00:20:37,637 --> 00:20:43,343
>> WE LIVED TOGETHER FOR THREE

370
00:20:43,343 --> 00:20:50,283
YEARS, MAN.

371
00:20:43,343 --> 00:20:50,283
>> OOH.

372
00:20:43,343 --> 00:20:50,283
SORRY, DEREK.

373
00:20:50,283 --> 00:20:53,987
THE CORRECT ANSWER WAS DEREK.

374
00:20:50,283 --> 00:20:53,987
>> WE'VE GOT THE SAME NAME?

375
00:20:53,987 --> 00:20:57,857
>> THAT WAS OUR WHOLE THING,

376
00:20:53,987 --> 00:20:57,857
MAN.

377
00:20:53,987 --> 00:20:57,857
D-1, D-2.

378
00:20:57,857 --> 00:21:00,927
>> DAMN, THAT'S REALLY BAD, MAN.

379
00:20:57,857 --> 00:21:00,927
I'M SORRY.

380
00:20:57,857 --> 00:21:00,927
WE SHOULD GRAB A DRINK OR

381
00:21:00,927 --> 00:21:07,434
SOMETHING SOMETIME AND CATCH UP.

382
00:21:00,927 --> 00:21:07,434
>> UH-OH.

383
00:21:00,927 --> 00:21:07,434
THE SOUND OF SOMEONE INVITING A

384
00:21:07,434 --> 00:21:13,073
FRIEND TO DRINKS WHEN THEY HAVE

385
00:21:07,434 --> 00:21:13,073
NO INTENTION OF EVER GETTING

386
00:21:07,434 --> 00:21:13,073
DRINKS MEANS WE'RE OUT OF TIME.

387
00:21:13,073 --> 00:21:14,841
SO LET'S GO TO THE FINAL

388
00:21:13,073 --> 00:21:14,841
QUESTION TO DETERMINE IF YOUR

389
00:21:13,073 --> 00:21:14,841
BRAIN IS OKAY.

390
00:21:14,841 --> 00:21:18,978
CONTESTANTS, WRITE DOWN YOUR

391
00:21:14,841 --> 00:21:18,978
ANSWERS, PLEASE.

392
00:21:14,841 --> 00:21:18,978
IF YOU HAD TO TALK TO A PERSON,

393
00:21:18,978 --> 00:21:24,284
IF YOU HAD TO TALK TO A PERSON,

394
00:21:18,978 --> 00:21:24,284
WHAT'S A GOOD WAY TO START?

395
00:21:18,978 --> 00:21:24,284
AND GO.

396
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:32,859
**

397
00:21:32,859 --> 00:21:37,097
ALL RIGHT.

398
00:21:32,859 --> 00:21:37,097
LET'S SEE YOUR IDEA OF HOW TO

399
00:21:32,859 --> 00:21:37,097
START A CONVERSATION.

400
00:21:37,097 --> 00:21:40,633
JENNIFER, I NOTICED YOU WROTE

401
00:21:37,097 --> 00:21:40,633
WITH YOUR TONGUE.

402
00:21:37,097 --> 00:21:40,633
>> WELL, THERE'S STILL ONE

403
00:21:40,633 --> 00:21:47,007
VARIANT I HAVEN'T GOTTEN.

404
00:21:40,633 --> 00:21:47,007
>> OKAY.

405
00:21:40,633 --> 00:21:47,007
JENNIFER SAID, "LET ME BE INSIDE

406
00:21:47,007 --> 00:21:54,114
YOU, NOW."

407
00:21:47,007 --> 00:21:54,114
AND JENNIFER, WHO DO YOU IMAGINE

408
00:21:54,114 --> 00:21:57,250
SAYING THAT TO?

409
00:21:54,114 --> 00:21:57,250
>> ANYONE FROM STRANGERS TO

410
00:21:54,114 --> 00:21:57,250
PARENTS.

411
00:21:57,250 --> 00:22:00,387
>> OKAY.

412
00:21:57,250 --> 00:22:00,387
SORRY.

413
00:21:57,250 --> 00:22:00,387
THAT'S INCORRECT.

414
00:22:00,387 --> 00:22:04,224
YOUR BRAIN IS NOT OKAY.

415
00:22:00,387 --> 00:22:04,224
VICTOR, HOW WOULD YOU START A

416
00:22:00,387 --> 00:22:04,224
CONVERSATION?

417
00:22:04,224 --> 00:22:07,060
LET'S SEE.

418
00:22:04,224 --> 00:22:07,060
"HEAVEN MUST BE MISSING AN ANGEL

419
00:22:04,224 --> 00:22:07,060
BECAUSE WHEN I WOKE UP THERE WAS

420
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:10,930
A GLOWING FIGURE HOVERING OVER

421
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:10,930
MY BED.

422
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:10,930
I GUESS IT COULD HAVE BEEN A

423
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:16,636
GHOST.

424
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:16,636
I'M WORRIED I'M LOSING MY GRIP

425
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:16,636
ON REALITY.

426
00:22:16,636 --> 00:22:21,641
HA-HA-HA."

427
00:22:16,636 --> 00:22:21,641
>> YES, I'VE GIVEN THE GHOST A

428
00:22:16,636 --> 00:22:21,641
NAME.

429
00:22:21,641 --> 00:22:23,710
BLUEBAR.

430
00:22:21,641 --> 00:22:23,710
>> OKAY, WELL THAT'S VERY

431
00:22:21,641 --> 00:22:23,710
INCORRECT.

432
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:29,649
YOUR BRAIN IS ALSO BAD.

433
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:29,649
>> WHEN YOU TALK, ALL I PICTURE

434
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:29,649
IS THE SKELETON INSIDE YOUR

435
00:22:29,649 --> 00:22:34,421
HEAD.

436
00:22:29,649 --> 00:22:34,421
>> WELL, MAMA.

437
00:22:34,421 --> 00:22:38,792
OKAY.

438
00:22:34,421 --> 00:22:38,792
DEREK, IT'S DOWN TO YOU.

439
00:22:34,421 --> 00:22:38,792
AND YOU WROTE, "IF YOU SET THE

440
00:22:38,792 --> 00:22:43,096
CLOCK AHEAD YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE

441

ALIVE AS LONG."

442
00:22:38,792 --> 00:22:43,096
AND YOU KNOW SOMETHING?

443
00:22:43,096 --> 00:22:49,235
YOU'RE RIGHT.

444
00:22:43,096 --> 00:22:49,235
>> OH, MY GOD, I WON?

445
00:22:43,096 --> 00:22:49,235
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

446
00:22:49,235 --> 00:22:52,806
YOU CAME UP WITH A GREAT WAY TO

447
00:22:49,235 --> 00:22:52,806
MINIMIZE THE TIME WE'RE AWAKE

448
00:22:49,235 --> 00:22:52,806
AND ALIVE.

449
00:22:52,806 --> 00:22:59,112
AND YOU CAN CHOOSE YOUR PRIZE.

450
00:22:52,806 --> 00:22:59,112
A TWO-WEEK ALL-INCLUSIVE TRIP TO

451
00:22:52,806 --> 00:22:59,112
HAWAII OR YOU CAN GO BACK TO

452
00:22:59,112 --> 00:23:06,286
YOUR APARTMENT AND STAY THERE.

453
00:22:59,112 --> 00:23:06,286
>> APARTMENT.

454
00:22:59,112 --> 00:23:06,286
>> THEY ALWAYS SAY APARTMENT.

455
00:23:06,286 --> 00:23:09,889
THANKS FOR WATCHING "IS MY BRAIN

456
00:23:06,286 --> 00:23:09,889
OKAY?"

457
00:23:06,286 --> 00:23:09,889
IF YOU'VE GOT TO ASK, IT'S

458
00:23:09,889 --> 00:23:13,560
PROBABLY NOT.

459
00:23:09,889 --> 00:23:13,560
GOOD NIGHT.

460
00:23:20,041 --> 00:23:23,744
>>> THESE DAYS WHEN I SIT DOWN
TO WATCH A MOVIE,

461
00:23:23,744 --> 00:23:26,479
I CAN FIND
JUST ABOUT ANYTHING IN THE
WORLD.

462
00:23:26,479 --> 00:23:31,077
BUT NIGHT AFTER NIGHT, THERE'S
ONLY ONE KIND OF MOVIE I'M
ALWAYS LOOKING FOR.

467
00:23:44,402 --> 00:23:47,762
FOUND A FLICK
ABOUT TO PICK IT *

I CLICK IT

468
00:23:47,762 --> 00:23:51,093
I LOOK DOWN *
* RIGHT BELOW THE LINE
AND THAT'S WHEN I SEE
THE RUN TIME *

469

506
00:25:50,908 --> 00:25:54,607
>> IT'S SO SAD.

507
00:25:54,607 --> 00:25:56,633
>> SO THINK ABOUT THIS.

508
00:25:56,633 --> 00:26:00,769
SEX AND THE CITY 2 WAS 2 HOURS
AND 26 MINUTES LONG.

509
00:26:00,769 --> 00:26:03,589
TO PUT THAT IN PERSPECTIVE, THE
MOVIE "JURASSIC PARK"

510
00:26:03,589 --> 00:26:06,161
WAS TWO
HOURS AND SEVEN MINUTES LONG.

511
00:26:06,161 --> 00:26:10,403
THAT WAS A MOVIE THAT TOLD THE
HISTORY OF DINOSAURS,
HOW DNA WORKS

512
00:26:10,403 --> 00:26:14,187
AND EXPLAINED THE SCIENCE
OF BRINGING DINOSAURS BACK TO
LIFE.

513
00:26:14,187 --> 00:26:19,850
AND "SEX AND THE CITY 2," YOU
KNOW, WHICH WAS A MOVIE ABOUT
FOUR WOMEN WE ALREADY KNEW, WAS
20 MINUTES LONGER.

514
00:26:19,850 --> 00:26:21,579
I'M NOT SAYING THAT'S BAD OR
ANYTHING.

515
00:26:21,579 --> 00:26:24,696
I'M JUST SAYING, THAT'S SOME
CRAZY [ BLEEP ] RIGHT?

516
00:26:24,696 --> 00:26:26,835
>> HOW LONG WAS "THE KING OF
STATEN ISLAND?"

517
00:26:26,835 --> 00:26:30,080
>> IT WAS LIKE 2 HOURS AND
17 MINUTES.

518
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:32,833
BUT WE NEEDED -- WE NEEDED ALL
THOSE MINUTES.

WHY DOES THAT DOLL HAVE A

00:29:09,449 --> 00:29:12,852
RAINBOW BUSH?

THAT'S THE END OF THE HEAD SPOOL

00:29:21,594 --> 00:29:25,899
INSIDE SO YOU CAN SEE THE SPIN.

626
00:29:21,594 --> 00:29:25,899
IT'S AN ANCHOR POINT.

627
00:29:25,899 --> 00:29:31,404
ANY DOLL MAKER WOULD KNOW THAT.

628
00:29:25,899 --> 00:29:31,404
>> WELL, I'M NOT A DOLL MAKER.

629
00:29:25,899 --> 00:29:31,404
SO WHAT I SEE IS A THICK-ASS

SMITH'S AGENT TELLING HIM, "YOU

DON'T KNOW, WALKED ON STAGE

DURING THE ACADEMY AWARDS AND

898
00:40:28,661 --> 00:40:33,566
SLAPPED CHRIS ROCK AFTER HE MADE

A JOKE ABOUT JADA PINKETT-SMITH,

900

WHICH I THINK WAS A DISGRACEFUL

901
00:40:33,566 --> 00:40:37,404
ACT THAT SETS A TERRIBLE

902
00:40:37,404 --> 00:40:45,311
PRECEDENT FOR HAVING TO DEFEND

903

YOUR WIFE AT AWARDS SHOWS.

904
00:40:45,311 --> 00:40:48,682

COMING FROM.

912
00:40:57,023 --> 00:41:02,529
I MEAN YOU CAN'T EXPECT HIM TO

00:40:57,023 --> 00:41:02,529
SIT THERE AND WATCH ANOTHER MAN

914

LOOK.

923
00:41:14,374 --> 00:41:21,114

EVERYTHING.

938
00:41:45,305 --> 00:41:47,674
IT'S LIKE KANYE SAYING "DON'T

TIRED OF PEOPLE PUTTING THEIR

943

INSECURITIES ON MY JOKE

INTENTIONS.

945
00:41:52,178 --> 00:41:55,882
I CAN'T MAKE A JOKE ABOUT IT

946
00:41:55,882 --> 00:42:04,290
BEING COLD OUTSIDE WITHOUT

947
00:41:55,882 --> 00:42:04,290
SOMEBODY YELLING BACK, "STOP

948
00:41:55,882 --> 00:42:04,290
MAKING FUN OF MY SMALL PENIS!"

949

KEEP MY SMALL PENIS --

950
00:42:04,290 --> 00:42:08,328
GO AHEAD.

951
00:42:08,328 --> 00:42:15,535
I'M SORRY.

952
00:42:08,328 --> 00:42:15,535
>>> I ALSO REALLY LOVE THAT THE

953
00:42:15,535 --> 00:42:18,471
REASON THEY LET WILL SMITH STAY

954
00:42:15,535 --> 00:42:18,471
IN THE AUDIENCE WAS THAT THEY

955
00:42:15,535 --> 00:42:18,471
ASKED CHRIS ROCK AND HE SAID IT

956
00:42:18,471 --> 00:42:21,608
WAS OKAY.

957
00:42:18,471 --> 00:42:21,608
SO NOW WE JUST ASK THE VICTIM

958
00:42:18,471 --> 00:42:21,608
RIGHT AFTER THEY GET HIT IN THE

959
00:42:21,608 --> 00:42:25,211
HEAD?

960
00:42:21,608 --> 00:42:25,211
"HEY, ARE YOU COOL IF THE GUY

961
00:42:21,608 --> 00:42:25,211
WHO JUST ATTACKED YOU HANGS

962
00:42:25,211 --> 00:42:30,183
AROUND FOR A WHILE?

963
00:42:25,211 --> 00:42:30,183
YOU DON'T WANT TO MAKE HIM MAD

964
00:42:25,211 --> 00:42:30,183
AGAIN."

965
00:42:30,183 --> 00:42:32,419
I CAN'T BELIEVE THE ACADEMY HAS

966
00:42:30,183 --> 00:42:32,419
A WORSE CONCUSSION PROTOCOL THAN

967
00:42:32,419 --> 00:42:38,091
THE NFL.

968
00:42:32,419 --> 00:42:38,091
AND HONESTLY, I CAN'T EVEN BLAME

969
00:42:38,091 --> 00:42:40,260
THE ACADEMY FOR NOT KNOWING WHAT

970
00:42:38,091 --> 00:42:40,260
TO DO.

971
00:42:38,091 --> 00:42:40,260
NOBODY KNEW WHAT TO DO.

972
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:44,497
EVEN PEOPLE AT THE OSCARS WERE

973
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:44,497
GOOGLING, "DID WILL SMITH JUST

974
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:44,497
SLAP CHRIS ROCK?"

975
00:42:44,497 --> 00:42:51,771
I THINK WE SHOULD JUST

976
00:42:44,497 --> 00:42:51,771
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THAT WAS ONE OF

977
00:42:51,771 --> 00:42:55,608
THE CRAZIEST THINGS WE WILL EVER

978
00:42:51,771 --> 00:42:55,608
SEE IN OUR LIVES.

979
00:42:51,771 --> 00:42:55,608
IT'S TRULY LIKE THE SUPER BOWL

980
00:42:55,608 --> 00:42:58,978
WARDROBE MALFUNCTION BUT IF

981

00:42:55,608 --> 00:42:58,978
TIMBERLAKE.

983
00:42:58,978 --> 00:43:06,820
>>> NOT TO MENTION, CHRIS ROCK

984
00:42:58,978 --> 00:43:06,820
HAS BEEN VERY PUBLIC ABOUT HIS

985
00:43:06,820 --> 00:43:11,691
NON-VERBAL LEARNING DISORDER.

986
00:43:06,820 --> 00:43:11,691
WHICH MEANS IT'S HARD FOR HIM TO

987
00:43:06,820 --> 00:43:11,691
UNDERSTAND NON-VERBAL SIGNALS.

988
00:43:11,691 --> 00:43:18,098
SORT OF LIKE HOW WHEN HE SAW AN

989
00:43:11,691 --> 00:43:18,098
ANGRY WILL SMITH CHARGING TOWARD

990

HIM INSTEAD OF MOVING OUT OF THE

991
00:43:18,098 --> 00:43:22,168
WAY HE PUT BOTH HIS HANDS BEHIND

992
00:43:18,098 --> 00:43:22,168
HIS BACK, SMILED AND SAID,

993
00:43:18,098 --> 00:43:22,168
UH-OH.

994
00:43:22,168 --> 00:43:33,980

COCAINE IN FRONT OF HIM.

1002

ORGY?

1004

WAS DRUGS?

BROWN JACKSON IS A PERSON OF

EXCEPTIONALLY GOOD CHARACTER BUT

1012
00:44:09,049 --> 00:44:14,587
HE WOULD NOT SUPPORT HER FOR THE

SUPREME COURT.

1014
00:44:09,049 --> 00:44:14,587

1024
00:44:26,232 --> 00:44:30,270
EARNED HIM THE NICKNAME NICK

CANNON.

1026

CANNON.

1028
00:44:35,642 --> 00:44:39,512
WERE CRITICIZED FOR ASKING

IRRELEVANT, SENSATIONAL

1030

OH, WOW.

WHAT A WEEK.

1038
00:44:51,791 --> 00:44:54,527
ALL ANYONE IS TALKING ABOUT ARE

1039
00:44:54,527 --> 00:45:01,401
THESE CONFIRMATION HEARINGS.

1040
00:44:54,527 --> 00:45:01,401
OH, WE CRUSHED IT.

1041
00:44:54,527 --> 00:45:01,401
SO MANY GREAT, SMART QUESTIONS.

1042
00:45:01,401 --> 00:45:07,607
ARE BABIES RACIST?

1043
00:45:01,401 --> 00:45:07,607
IS MURDER BAD?

1044
00:45:01,401 --> 00:45:07,607
AND THOSE ARE REAL QUESTIONS

1045
00:45:07,607 --> 00:45:10,276
THAT MY FELLOW REPUBLICANS ASKED

1046
00:45:07,607 --> 00:45:10,276
AN ADULT JUDGE.

1047
00:45:10,276 --> 00:45:17,417
>> RIGHT, YEAH.

1048
00:45:10,276 --> 00:45:17,417
AND WHAT DID YOU ASK HER?

1049
00:45:10,276 --> 00:45:17,417
>> OH, I HIT HER WITH THE COUP

1050
00:45:17,417 --> 00:45:24,591
DE GRACE.

1051
00:45:17,417 --> 00:45:24,591
YOU READY FOR THIS?

1052
00:45:17,417 --> 00:45:24,591
DEFINE WOMAN.

1053
00:45:24,591 --> 00:45:26,960
>> DEFINE WOMAN?

1054
00:45:24,591 --> 00:45:26,960
>> DEFINE WOMAN.

1055
00:45:24,591 --> 00:45:26,960
AND SHE COULDN'T DO IT.

1056
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:32,232
I MEAN, HUH?

1057
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:32,232
>> WELL, IT'S KIND OF A NUANCED,

1058
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:32,232
COMPLICATED QUESTION.

1059
00:45:32,232 --> 00:45:36,836
>> COMPLICATED HOW?

1060
00:45:32,232 --> 00:45:36,836
>> WELL, OKAY.

1061
00:45:32,232 --> 00:45:36,836
HOW DO YOU DEFINE WOMAN?

1062
00:45:36,836 --> 00:45:43,977
>> ARE YOU JERKING MY PERM?

1063
00:45:36,836 --> 00:45:43,977
YOU HONESTLY DON'T KNOW?

1064
00:45:36,836 --> 00:45:43,977
COLIN, IT'S BIOLOGY, COLIN.

1065
00:45:43,977 --> 00:45:48,848
OKAY?

1066
00:45:43,977 --> 00:45:48,848
IT'S YOUR PRIVATE PARTS.

1067
00:45:43,977 --> 00:45:48,848
THE ONES YOU HAVE WHEN YOU'RE

1068
00:45:48,848 --> 00:45:53,753
BORN.

1069
00:45:48,848 --> 00:45:53,753
BUT JUST THE BOTTOM PRIVATE

1070
00:45:48,848 --> 00:45:53,753
PARTS BECAUSE THE ONES LATER --

OKAY, I'M GOING TO -- IT'S YOUR

1072
00:45:53,753 --> 00:45:57,557
PERIOD.

1073
00:45:53,753 --> 00:45:57,557
UNLESS YOU'RE OLD OR YOUNG.

1074
00:45:57,557 --> 00:46:00,627
OR PREGNANT.

1075
00:45:57,557 --> 00:46:00,627
OR STRESSED OUT.

1076

OR DOING GYMNASTICS.

1077
00:46:00,627 --> 00:46:03,029
NO, SCRATCH THAT.

1078
00:46:00,627 --> 00:46:03,029
I'M GOING BACK TO BABY PRIVATES.

1079

>> YOU'RE NOT MAKING ANY SENSE.

1096
00:46:28,321 --> 00:46:33,893
>> YOU ARE JUST NOT GETTING IT.

1097
00:46:28,321 --> 00:46:33,893
LET ME SHOW YOU.

1098
00:46:33,893 --> 00:46:39,466
OOH, YES.

1099
00:46:33,893 --> 00:46:39,466
DON'T WE LOVE THESE BIG STUPID

1100
00:46:33,893 --> 00:46:39,466
DUMB-ASS BOARDS WITH THESE BIG

1101
00:46:39,466 --> 00:46:47,207
STUPID DUMB-ASS PICTURES?

1102
00:46:39,466 --> 00:46:47,207
COME ON, LOOK HOW SIMPLE IT IS.

1103
00:46:47,207 --> 00:46:49,743
THE COLOR PINK.

1104
00:46:47,207 --> 00:46:49,743
THE ONES WITH BEEHIVE HAIRDOS

1105
00:46:47,207 --> 00:46:49,743
AND A PART SIDE.

1106
00:46:49,743 --> 00:46:52,112
IT'S LONGER THINNER CIGARETTES.

1107
00:46:49,743 --> 00:46:52,112
YOU KNOW, THEY'RE HAVING FUN

1108
00:46:49,743 --> 00:46:52,112
DANCING AROUND IN A COMMERCIAL

1109
00:46:52,112 --> 00:46:56,349
FOR UNDERWEAR YOU CAN PEE IN.

1110
00:46:52,112 --> 00:46:56,349
DO YOU GET IT YET?

1111
00:46:52,112 --> 00:46:56,349
>> I THINK I GET IT LESS.

1112
00:46:56,349 --> 00:47:02,288
>> OKAY.

1113
00:46:56,349 --> 00:47:02,288
WELL --

1114
00:47:02,288 --> 00:47:05,558
>> WHY IS DEFINING WOMAN EVEN

1115
00:47:02,288 --> 00:47:05,558
RELEVANT TO A CONFIRMATION

1116

>> ARE YOU KIDDING?

1118
00:47:05,558 --> 00:47:11,831
IT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING

1119
00:47:05,558 --> 00:47:11,831
FOR A SUPREME COURT JUSTICE.

1120
00:47:11,831 --> 00:47:16,036
BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT A

1121
00:47:11,831 --> 00:47:16,036
WOMAN IS, HOW THE HELL ARE YOU

1122
00:47:11,831 --> 00:47:16,036
GOING TO TAKE HER RIGHTS AWAY?

1123
00:47:16,036 --> 00:47:17,270
CAN I GET AN AMEN?

1124
00:47:16,036 --> 00:47:17,270
>> NO.

1125
00:47:17,270 --> 00:47:18,838
MARSHA BLACKBURN.

1126
00:47:17,270 --> 00:47:18,838

00:52:17,070 --> 00:52:22,308
>> I'M COLIN JOST.

1294
00:52:17,070 --> 00:52:22,308
GOOD NIGHT.

1295
00:52:36,089 --> 00:52:40,193
>> HE ISN'T GONE, SON.

1296
00:52:36,089 --> 00:52:40,193
POP-POP WILL ALWAYS LIVE ON

1297
00:52:36,089 --> 00:52:40,193
INSIDE OF ALL OF US.

1298
00:52:40,193 --> 00:52:43,797
>> THAT'S BEAUTIFUL.

1299
00:52:40,193 --> 00:52:43,797
>> WELL SAID, SIR.

1300
00:52:40,193 --> 00:52:43,797
>> WELL, SWEETIE, ARE YOU READY

1301
00:52:43,797 --> 00:52:48,702
TO SAY GOOD-BYE?

1302
00:52:43,797 --> 00:52:48,702
>> YEAH.

1303
00:52:43,797 --> 00:52:48,702
BUT FIRST I WANT TO SHARE

1304
00:52:48,702 --> 00:52:51,271
SOMETHING WITH YOU GUYS.

1305
00:52:48,702 --> 00:52:51,271
YOU KNOW, THIS SPOT WAS WHERE

1306
00:52:48,702 --> 00:52:51,271
POP-POP WOULD TAKE ME AFTER MY

1307
00:52:51,271 --> 00:52:56,109
BALL GAMES.

1308
00:52:51,271 --> 00:52:56,109
BELIEVE IT OR NOT, I WASN'T MUCH

1309
00:52:51,271 --> 00:52:56,109
OF AN ATHLETE.

1310
00:52:56,109 --> 00:53:00,480
OKAY, OKAY.

1311
00:52:56,109 --> 00:53:00,480
HA HA.

1312
00:52:56,109 --> 00:53:00,480
BUT POP-POP, HE'D TAKE ME HERE,

1313
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:03,917
HE'D POINT OUT TO THE SEA AND

1314
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:03,917
SAY, "SON, LIFE IS LIKE THE

1315
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:03,917
TIDE.

1316
00:53:03,917 --> 00:53:10,757
THERE'S HIGHS AND LOWS BUT

1317
00:53:03,917 --> 00:53:10,757
EVENTUALLY IT ALL WASHES AWAY."

1318
00:53:03,917 --> 00:53:10,757
I'M GOING TO MISS YOU, DAD.

1319
00:53:10,757 --> 00:53:13,193
>> WOW.

1320
00:53:10,757 --> 00:53:13,193
THAT'S A BEAUTIFUL STORY,

1321
00:53:10,757 --> 00:53:13,193
MR. KLEIN.

1322
00:53:13,193 --> 00:53:22,168
THANK YOU FOR SHARING.

1323
00:53:13,193 --> 00:53:22,168
>> THANK ALL OF YOU FOR ALLOWING

1324
00:53:13,193 --> 00:53:22,168
US AT BOUDREAU'S MORTUARY FOR

1325
00:53:22,168 --> 00:53:24,270
ALLOWING US TO BE PART OF THIS

1326
00:53:22,168 --> 00:53:24,270
MOMENT WITH YOU.

1327
00:53:22,168 --> 00:53:24,270
>> NOW IF YOU'RE READY, PLEASE

1328
00:53:24,270 --> 00:53:36,816
BOW YOUR HEADS AS WE SCATTER THE

1329
00:53:24,270 --> 00:53:36,816
REMAINS.

1330
00:53:24,270 --> 00:53:36,816
READY?

1331
00:53:36,816 --> 00:53:46,326
>> OH GOD, NO!

1332
00:53:46,326 --> 00:53:53,099
>> THESE MOMENTS ARE ALWAYS SO

1333
00:53:46,326 --> 00:53:53,099
HARD.

1334
00:53:46,326 --> 00:53:53,099
WE'LL GIVE YOU FOLKS SOME SPACE.

1335
00:53:53,099 --> 00:53:56,770
>> WHAT THE HELL DID YOU JUST

1336
00:53:53,099 --> 00:53:56,770
DO?

1337
00:53:53,099 --> 00:53:56,770
>> WE SAID GOOD-BYE TO POP-POP.

1338
00:53:56,770 --> 00:54:03,443
>> HE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE

1339
00:53:56,770 --> 00:54:03,443
CREMATED!

1340
00:53:56,770 --> 00:54:03,443
>> WHO WAS?

1341
00:54:03,443 --> 00:54:09,249
>> MY FATHER.

1342
00:54:03,443 --> 00:54:09,249
HE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE CREMATED,

1343
00:54:03,443 --> 00:54:09,249
NOT CHUCKED OFF A CLIFF.

1344
00:54:09,249 --> 00:54:13,053
>> MM.

1345
00:54:09,249 --> 00:54:13,053
>> MM-HMM.

1346
00:54:09,249 --> 00:54:13,053
>> OKAY.

1347
00:54:13,053 --> 00:54:23,229
>> MM-HMM.

1348
00:54:13,053 --> 00:54:23,229
>> SO THAT WAS NOT RELAYED TO

1349
00:54:13,053 --> 00:54:23,229
US.

1350
00:54:23,229 --> 00:54:26,566
>> YEAH.

1351
00:54:23,229 --> 00:54:26,566
BUT IN A WAY WASN'T THIS KIND OF

1352
00:54:23,229 --> 00:54:26,566
BETTER?

1353
00:54:26,566 --> 00:54:28,935
>> I'LL SPEAK ON THAT.

1354
00:54:26,566 --> 00:54:28,935
>> WELL, YOU GOT THE BODY ASPECT

1355
00:54:26,566 --> 00:54:28,935
OF A BURIAL BUT WE STILL GOT TO

1356
00:54:28,935 --> 00:54:31,971
THROW HIM.

1357
00:54:28,935 --> 00:54:31,971
>> YEAH.

1358
00:54:28,935 --> 00:54:31,971
I LIKE THAT.

1359
00:54:31,971 --> 00:54:36,643
WELL --

1360
00:54:31,971 --> 00:54:36,643
**

1361
00:54:31,971 --> 00:54:36,643
>> TIME FOR THE DREADED CHECK.

1362
00:54:36,643 --> 00:54:43,416
DAMN YOU, SIR!

1363
00:54:36,643 --> 00:54:43,416
WHO'S THE BOSS AROUND HERE?

1364
00:54:36,643 --> 00:54:43,416
YOU, I ASSUME?

1365
00:54:43,416 --> 00:54:46,953
JUST KIDDING, SPORT.

1366
00:54:43,416 --> 00:54:46,953
MAYBE --

1367
00:54:43,416 --> 00:54:46,953
>> DO NOT TOUCH ME, MAN!

1368
00:54:46,953 --> 00:54:49,222
>> ABSOLUTELY.

1369
00:54:46,953 --> 00:54:49,222
SIR, WHENEVER YOU'RE READY.

1370
00:54:46,953 --> 00:54:49,222
>> WE'RE NOT GOING TO PAY FOR

1371
00:54:49,222 --> 00:54:53,226
THIS.

1372
00:54:49,222 --> 00:54:53,226
>> MM.

1373
00:54:49,222 --> 00:54:53,226
MAY I ASK WHY?

1374
00:54:53,226 --> 00:54:58,598
>> YOU THREW MY FATHER-IN-LAW

1375
00:54:53,226 --> 00:54:58,598
OFF A CLIFF!

1376
00:54:53,226 --> 00:54:58,598
>> OKAY.

1377
00:54:58,598 --> 00:55:04,504
SEE, I THOUGHT WE RESOLVED THAT.

1378
00:54:58,598 --> 00:55:04,504
>> NO, WE DID NOT!

1379
00:54:58,598 --> 00:55:04,504
>> HONEY, CALM DOWN.

1380
00:55:04,504 --> 00:55:08,942
YOUR CONDITION.

1381
00:55:04,504 --> 00:55:08,942
>> OKAY.

1382
00:55:04,504 --> 00:55:08,942
YOU KNOW WHAT?

1383
00:55:08,942 --> 00:55:15,115
I FEEL LIKE YOU GUYS ARE MAD.

1384
00:55:08,942 --> 00:55:15,115
HOW ABOUT I JUST GO GET HIM?

1385
00:55:08,942 --> 00:55:15,115
AH!

1386
00:55:15,115 --> 00:55:24,891
>> SO WHAT YOU GUYS GOT COOKING

1387
00:55:15,115 --> 00:55:24,891
UP THIS WEEKEND?

1388
00:55:24,891 --> 00:55:29,729
>> I REALLY DON'T WANT TO TALK

1389
00:55:24,891 --> 00:55:29,729
ABOUT THAT.

1390
00:55:24,891 --> 00:55:29,729
>> WHY DID YOU BRING AN URN?

1391
00:55:29,729 --> 00:55:33,667
>> OH, THIS?

1392
00:55:29,729 --> 00:55:33,667
THIS ISN'T AN URN.

1393
00:55:29,729 --> 00:55:33,667
IT'S SOUP.

1394
00:55:33,667 --> 00:55:40,674
>> YOU KEEP SOUP IN AN URN?

1395
00:55:33,667 --> 00:55:40,674
>> NO, IT'S A THERMOS.

1396
00:55:33,667 --> 00:55:40,674
IT LOOKS LIKE AB URN.

1397
00:55:40,674 --> 00:55:43,843
I GOT IT AT THE MORTICIAN'S

1398
00:55:40,674 --> 00:55:43,843
CONFERENCE.

1399
00:55:40,674 --> 00:55:43,843
>> I GOT HIM.

1400
00:55:43,843 --> 00:55:46,579
>> GOOD JOB, MAN.

1401
00:55:43,843 --> 00:55:46,579
>> WHAT WERE YOU GUYS TALKING

1402
00:55:43,843 --> 00:55:46,579
ABOUT?

1403
00:55:46,579 --> 00:55:49,149
>> THEY WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT

1404
00:55:46,579 --> 00:55:49,149
THE URN.

1405
00:55:46,579 --> 00:55:49,149
>> OH, THE THERMOS?

1406
00:55:49,149 --> 00:55:53,987
PRETTY COOL, RIGHT?

1407
00:55:49,149 --> 00:55:53,987
>> NO, IT ISN'T.

1408
00:55:49,149 --> 00:55:53,987
IT'S NOT COOL!

1409
00:55:53,987 --> 00:55:59,559
JESUS, JUST GET THE BODY BACK!

1410
00:55:53,987 --> 00:55:59,559
>> DON'T WORRY, SIR.

1411
00:55:53,987 --> 00:55:59,559
I GOT POP-POP RIGHT HERE.

1412
00:55:59,559 --> 00:56:06,566
>> THAT ISN'T POP-POP.

1413
00:55:59,559 --> 00:56:06,566
>> THAT'S CLEARLY A YOUNG

1414
00:56:06,566 --> 00:56:12,806
CYCLIST.

1415
00:56:06,566 --> 00:56:12,806
HE'S WEARING THOSE LITTLE SHOES.

1416
00:56:06,566 --> 00:56:12,806
>> MM.

1417
00:56:12,806 --> 00:56:15,642
MM-HMM.

1418
00:56:12,806 --> 00:56:15,642
OKAY.

1419
00:56:12,806 --> 00:56:15,642
AND THAT'S A DEALBREAKER FOR YOU

1420
00:56:15,642 --> 00:56:18,812
GUYS?

1421
00:56:15,642 --> 00:56:18,812
>> YES.

1422
00:56:18,812 --> 00:56:26,553
>> ALL RIGHT.

1423
00:56:18,812 --> 00:56:26,553
I'LL JUST PUT HIM BACK.

1424
00:56:26,553 --> 00:56:28,888
SO HEY.

1425
00:56:26,553 --> 00:56:28,888
YOU THINK I CAN GET SOME OF THAT

1426
00:56:26,553 --> 00:56:28,888
SOUP?

1427
00:56:28,888 --> 00:56:34,694
>> OH, HELL, YEAH.

1428
00:56:28,888 --> 00:56:34,694
HEADS UP.

1429
00:56:28,888 --> 00:56:34,694
IT'S SHRIMP BISQUE.

1430
00:56:34,694 --> 00:56:36,730
HEADS UP.

1431
00:56:34,694 --> 00:56:36,730
IT'S SHRIMP BISQUE.

1432
00:56:47,407 --> 00:56:52,145
LIKE WHETHER HE DID IT OR NOT.

1433
00:56:47,407 --> 00:56:52,145
>> WOW.

1434
00:56:47,407 --> 00:56:52,145
THAT IS INSANELY COOL.

1435
00:56:52,145 --> 00:56:54,447

KEEP IN MIND IT'S 11:00 A.M.

1505
00:58:17,430 --> 00:58:22,836

1508
00:58:22,836 --> 00:58:25,538

WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

1512
00:58:25,538 --> 00:58:29,476
>> IT'S THE FRENCH WAITER.

1513

ANYWAY, I LOOKED OVER.

1521
00:58:45,658 --> 00:58:48,161
WHO'S SITTING AT THE BAR WITH A

1522
00:58:45,658 --> 00:58:48,161
SLY GRIN ON HIS FACE?

1523
00:58:45,658 --> 00:58:48,161
>> THE FRENCH WAITER.

1524
00:58:48,161 --> 00:58:50,296

1525
00:58:48,161 --> 00:58:50,296

1527
00:58:50,296 --> 00:58:53,500

1528
00:58:50,296 --> 00:58:53,500
>> OKAY, WAIT, WAIT.

1529
00:58:53,500 --> 00:58:57,871
DON'T TELL ME IT WAS FRANK.

1530
00:58:53,500 --> 00:58:57,871
>> IT WAS FRANK.

1531
00:58:53,500 --> 00:58:57,871
>> OH, MY GOD, FRANK.

1532
00:58:57,871 --> 00:59:02,042

1533
00:58:57,871 --> 00:59:02,042

1534
00:58:57,871 --> 00:59:02,042
WAIT.

1535
00:59:02,042 --> 00:59:06,780
WHO'S FRANK?

1536
00:59:02,042 --> 00:59:06,780
>> HE'S JUST OUR FRIEND.

1537
00:59:02,042 --> 00:59:06,780
HE'S A BIT OF A PRANKSTER.

1538
00:59:06,780 --> 00:59:10,383
>> WOW.

1539
00:59:06,780 --> 00:59:10,383
THAT IS -- I'VE NEVER HEARD

1540
00:59:06,780 --> 00:59:10,383
ANYTHING LIKE THAT.

1541
00:59:10,383 --> 00:59:12,118
>> YEAH.

1542
00:59:10,383 --> 00:59:12,118
KIND OF FUNNY.

1543
00:59:12,118 --> 00:59:13,520
RIGHT?

1544
00:59:12,118 --> 00:59:13,520
ANYWAY, HOW ARE YOU GUYS?

1545
00:59:12,118 --> 00:59:13,520
HOW WAS MEXICO?

1546
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:17,490
>> OH, MY GOD.

1547
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:17,490
IT WAS SO FUN --

1548
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:17,490
>> WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

1549
00:59:17,490 --> 00:59:20,427
SO THEN WHAT HAPPENED?

1550
00:59:17,490 --> 00:59:20,427
>> WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

1551
00:59:17,490 --> 00:59:20,427
>> DID YOUR BOSS JUST WIG OUT?

1552
00:59:20,427 --> 00:59:30,770
HE'S LIKE KNOCKING OVER THE

1553
00:59:20,427 --> 00:59:30,770
TABLE LIKE AH, EVERYONE'S FIRED!

1554
00:59:20,427 --> 00:59:30,770
>> NOPE.

1555
00:59:30,770 --> 00:59:32,872
IT'S PRETTY MUCH THE END OF THE

1556
00:59:30,770 --> 00:59:32,872
STORY, MAN.

1557
00:59:30,770 --> 00:59:32,872
>> OH.

1558
00:59:32,872 --> 00:59:34,774
BUT THE FRENCH WAITER WAS HIGH

1559
00:59:32,872 --> 00:59:34,774
ON DOPE, RIGHT?

1560
00:59:34,774 --> 00:59:37,944
>> WHAT?

1561
00:59:34,774 --> 00:59:37,944
HIGH ON DOPE?

1562
00:59:34,774 --> 00:59:37,944
>> NO.

1563
00:59:37,944 --> 00:59:40,180
EVERYTHING WAS NORMAL.

1564
00:59:37,944 --> 00:59:40,180
IT WAS JUST A DUMB STORY.

1565
00:59:37,944 --> 00:59:40,180
CAN WE TALK ABOUT SOMETHING

1566
00:59:40,180 --> 00:59:42,849
ELSE?

1567
00:59:40,180 --> 00:59:42,849
>> OH.

1568
00:59:40,180 --> 00:59:42,849
SORRY.

1569
00:59:42,849 --> 00:59:45,118
I THOUGHT THE FRENCH WAITER WAS

1570
00:59:42,849 --> 00:59:45,118
HIGH ON DOPE THE WHOLE TIME.

1571
00:59:45,118 --> 00:59:50,957
STILL AMAZING.

1572
00:59:45,118 --> 00:59:50,957
>> THE PLACE WAS FRENCH.

1573
00:59:45,118 --> 00:59:50,957
NOT THE WAITER.

1574
00:59:50,957 --> 00:59:55,328
I NEVER SAID THE WAITER WAS

1575
00:59:50,957 --> 00:59:55,328
FRENCH.

1576
00:59:50,957 --> 00:59:55,328
>> OH.

1577
00:59:55,328 --> 00:59:59,432
SORRY.

1578
00:59:55,328 --> 00:59:59,432
>> IT'S FINE.

1579
00:59:55,328 --> 00:59:59,432
ANYWAY, YOU SAID MEXICO WAS

1580
00:59:59,432 --> 01:00:02,235
GOOD?

1581
00:59:59,432 --> 01:00:02,235
>> SO GOOD.

1582
00:59:59,432 --> 01:00:02,235
YEAH.

1583
01:00:02,235 --> 01:00:04,337
TURNS OUT YOGA RETREATS ARE

1584
01:00:02,235 --> 01:00:04,337
RELAXING.

1585
01:00:02,235 --> 01:00:04,337
WHO KNEW?

1586
01:00:04,337 --> 01:00:07,941
>> DIDN'T MEAN TO CALL THE

1587
01:00:04,337 --> 01:00:07,941
WAITER FRENCH.

1588
01:00:07,941 --> 01:00:10,543
MY BAD.

1589
01:00:07,941 --> 01:00:10,543
SORRY AGAIN.

1590
01:00:07,941 --> 01:00:10,543
>> ALL GOOD, DUDE.

1591
01:00:10,543 --> 01:00:17,117
LET'S JUST DROP IT.

1592
01:00:10,543 --> 01:00:17,117
WE'RE MOVING ON.

1593
01:00:10,543 --> 01:00:17,117
>> WELL, BRADFORD HAD A GREAT

1594
01:00:17,117 --> 01:00:23,156
TIME AT THE MET.

1595
01:00:17,117 --> 01:00:23,156
IT WAS SO COOL, RIGHT?

1596
01:00:17,117 --> 01:00:23,156
>> I REALLY DID LOVE THE STORY,

1597
01:00:23,156 --> 01:00:25,191
MAN.

1598
01:00:23,156 --> 01:00:25,191
>> THANKS.

1599
01:00:25,191 --> 01:00:28,495
I APPRECIATE THAT.

1600
01:00:25,191 --> 01:00:28,495
>> WHAT WAS THE NAME OF THE

1601
01:00:25,191 --> 01:00:28,495
CRAZY BOSS AGAIN?

1602
01:00:28,495 --> 01:00:34,200
WAS IT ANDERSON?

1603
01:00:28,495 --> 01:00:34,200
>> IT WAS ANTHONY.

1604
01:00:28,495 --> 01:00:34,200
WE DON'T NEED TO TALK ABOUT IT

1605
01:00:34,200 --> 01:00:36,369
ANYMORE REALLY.

1606
01:00:34,200 --> 01:00:36,369
>> ANTHONY.

1607
01:00:34,200 --> 01:00:36,369
IT'S JUST LIKE THE PERFECT NAME

1608
01:00:36,369 --> 01:00:39,072
FOR IT.

1609
01:00:36,369 --> 01:00:39,072
REALLY SORRY IF I SCREWED UP THE

1610
01:00:36,369 --> 01:00:39,072
STORY.

1611
01:00:39,072 --> 01:00:43,510
>> BRADFORD.

1612
01:00:39,072 --> 01:00:43,510
IT'S FINE.

1613
01:00:39,072 --> 01:00:43,510
>> NO.

1614
01:00:43,510 --> 01:00:50,650
IT'S ACTUALLY NOT.

1615
01:00:43,510 --> 01:00:50,650
BRIAN, YOUR STORY WAS AMAZING.

1616
01:00:43,510 --> 01:00:50,650
IT HAD GREAT CHARACTERS.

1617
01:00:50,650 --> 01:00:56,056
AND THE PART WHERE THE CREPE

1618
01:00:50,650 --> 01:00:56,056
ISN'T CHEESE WAS UNBELIEVABLE.

1619
01:00:50,650 --> 01:00:56,056
AND THEN I MESSED THE WHOLE

1620
01:00:56,056 --> 01:01:01,361
THING UP.

1621
01:00:56,056 --> 01:01:01,361
I DON'T DESERVE TO BE YOUR

1622
01:00:56,056 --> 01:01:01,361
FRIEND.

1623
01:01:01,361 --> 01:01:07,100
>> DUDE, WE JUST MET.

1624
01:01:01,361 --> 01:01:07,100
HONESTLY, IT'S FINE.

1625
01:01:07,100 --> 01:01:10,704
>> NO, IT'S NOT.

1626
01:01:07,100 --> 01:01:10,704
LUNCH IS ON ME.

1627
01:01:07,100 --> 01:01:10,704
AND I WANT TO PAY YOUR RENT FOR

1628
01:01:10,704 --> 01:01:13,473
THE REST OF THE YEAR, TOO.

1629
01:01:10,704 --> 01:01:13,473
>> WHAT?

1630
01:01:13,473 --> 01:01:18,778
THAT'S SUPER GENEROUS, MAN.

1631
01:01:13,473 --> 01:01:18,778
>> HERE'S A CHECK FOR $1,000.

1632
01:01:13,473 --> 01:01:18,778
