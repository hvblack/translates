1
00:00:01,529 --> 00:00:03,980
Cheers is filmed before
a live studio audience.

2
00:00:06,951 --> 00:00:08,868
Hey, Sammy.

3
00:00:08,936 --> 00:00:10,386
Hey, Tim!

4
00:00:10,454 --> 00:00:12,054
I just heard the news.

5
00:00:12,122 --> 00:00:15,224
- You had a fire?
- Yeah.
A couple weeks ago.

6
00:00:15,225 --> 00:00:16,325
Gee, the place looks great.

7
00:00:16,326 --> 00:00:18,678
Yeah, thanks a lot.
We've been working pretty hard.

8
00:00:18,679 --> 00:00:20,614
We've got our grand reopening
tonight.

9
00:00:20,615 --> 00:00:22,164
So how'd the fire start?

10
00:00:22,232 --> 00:00:23,766
Oh, yeah, glad you asked.

11
00:00:23,834 --> 00:00:25,201
Sit down. Right there.

12
00:00:25,269 --> 00:00:26,686
Right there, yeah.

13
00:00:28,806 --> 00:00:30,740
Rebecca!

14
00:00:30,808 --> 00:00:32,742
Right over there.

15
00:00:34,578 --> 00:00:38,284
I burned down the bar
with a carelessly
tossed cigarette.

16
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,368
It was a stupid thing to do

17
00:00:41,436 --> 00:00:44,237
and I will be paying for it
for the rest of my life.

18
00:00:50,594 --> 00:00:53,629
Hey, Sammy,
you did a great job
on the rebuilding.

19
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:56,382
The place looks
a million times better
- than it did before.
- Yeah.

20
00:00:56,383 --> 00:00:57,701
Thanks, Paul. Uh, Sammy,

21
00:00:57,768 --> 00:00:59,536
uh, Paul told me all
about the fire.

22
00:00:59,537 --> 00:01:01,705
- Gee, that's tough, man.
- Oh, yeah, thank you.

23
00:01:01,706 --> 00:01:03,105
Oh, you want to hear
how it started?

24
00:01:03,106 --> 00:01:06,293
Yeah, sure. Yeah!
- Great, great.
Sit down right over there.

25
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:08,295
Rebecca!

26
00:01:08,362 --> 00:01:10,472
Right over there
in the sweater-go ahead.

27
00:01:12,433 --> 00:01:15,635
I burned down the bar
with a carelessly tossed cigarette.

28
00:01:15,702 --> 00:01:17,219
It was a stupid thing to do

29
00:01:17,287 --> 00:01:19,922
and I will be paying for it
for the rest of my life.

00:02:36,572 --> 00:02:38,306
Norm!

46
00:02:38,307 --> 00:02:40,625
Hey, Norm.
Gettin' ready
for the big opening.

47
00:02:40,626 --> 00:02:42,511
It's right here, Sammy.

48
00:02:42,578 --> 00:02:45,514
Start pouring beer
in it anytime.

49
00:02:45,581 --> 00:02:48,851
Listen, I guess we have
to start a new tab, huh?

50
00:02:48,852 --> 00:02:51,553
It's too bad
we lost my old bar tab
in the fire. Oh.

51
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:57,342
Actually, I-I had it
in the safe.

52
00:02:57,410 --> 00:03:00,095
You did?
Why?

53
00:03:00,163 --> 00:03:03,766
Well, to tell the truth,
it's kind of my most
valuable asset.

54
00:03:06,152 --> 00:03:09,254
I like to think of it as my-my
retirement plan, you know.

55
00:03:09,255 --> 00:03:11,556
I figure, one of these days,
you'll start paying

56
00:03:11,557 --> 00:03:14,392
and I can start thinking
about retiring.

57
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:17,179
Yeah, well, um, I'd
make other plans.

58
00:03:21,284 --> 00:03:23,753
Phone company.

59
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:25,520
Looking for a Rebecca Howe.

60
00:03:25,588 --> 00:03:26,638
That's me.

61
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:30,025
Well, hello!

62
00:03:31,527 --> 00:03:34,397
The name's Bernard.

63
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:37,266
If I'd known you were
such a foxy lady...

64
00:03:38,701 --> 00:03:41,369
I would have worn
my clean pants.

65
00:03:45,374 --> 00:03:47,926
Bernard, we need you
to get the phones working.

66
00:03:47,994 --> 00:03:49,144
The one here in the bar

67
00:03:49,145 --> 00:03:50,779
and one back in the office and
the pay phone over there.

68
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:53,014
We haven't had phone service
in two weeks.

69
00:03:53,082 --> 00:03:54,800
Relax, pretty lady.

70
00:03:54,867 --> 00:03:57,102
I'll give you service. Good.

71
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:59,204
Get it?

72
00:04:02,292 --> 00:04:04,943
So much for foreplay.

73
00:04:05,011 --> 00:04:07,463
Just fix the phones!

74
00:04:09,665 --> 00:04:12,403
Hey, huh?
You still got it with the guys!

75
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:18,441
Look at this place, huh?

76
00:04:18,442 --> 00:04:20,509
Can't wait to see how surprised
Carla's gonna be

77
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:23,311
when she sees how much work
we've done
in the last couple of weeks.

78
00:04:23,312 --> 00:04:24,913
Say, where is Carla, anyway?

79
00:04:24,914 --> 00:04:28,600
Oh, she, uh,
took a temporary job
over in that new bar
in Boylston, you know,

80
00:04:28,668 --> 00:04:30,702
"Mr. Pubb's" - one
of those chains.

81
00:04:30,703 --> 00:04:32,938
She'll be here for the
grand opening, though.

82
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:34,823
Yeah, well, I, for one,
don't miss her...

83
00:04:34,824 --> 00:04:37,760
that little foul-mouthed,
fright -wigged rodent.

84
00:04:37,827 --> 00:04:39,762
Hi, Carla.

85
00:04:45,084 --> 00:04:47,019
Hi, guys.

86
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:48,804
Woody, what are you doing
back here?

87
00:04:48,805 --> 00:04:50,372
How come you're not
on your honeymoon?

88
00:04:50,373 --> 00:04:52,691
Honeymoon?
Is that what you call it

89
00:04:52,692 --> 00:04:57,012
when two people lock
themselves in a room
and refuse to speak
or even look at each other?

90
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:59,415
No, Wood, that's marriage.

91
00:05:00,283 --> 00:05:02,801
Hey, what happened?

92
00:05:02,869 --> 00:05:06,755
Well, Kelly and I found out
we're from different religions.

93
00:05:06,823 --> 00:05:09,107
I thought you and Kelly were
both Lutheran.

94
00:05:09,175 --> 00:05:11,327
Oh, well, that's what I thought.

95
00:05:11,328 --> 00:05:13,612
It turns out she's Lutheran
Church of America,

96
00:05:13,679 --> 00:05:16,715
I'm Lutheran Church
of Missouri Synod.

97
00:05:16,782 --> 00:05:20,819
What if we had children,
we'd have half-breeds.

98
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:25,073
Woody, very often these
problems can be resolved

99
00:05:25,074 --> 00:05:27,343
by, uh, a group session.

100
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:29,728
Oh, no, I don't think so,
Doctor Crane.

101
00:05:29,795 --> 00:05:32,998
The sight of Kelly with another
man would drive me crazy.

102
00:05:33,066 --> 00:05:35,817
No, no, Frasier's talking
about counselling, Woody.

103
00:05:35,885 --> 00:05:37,770
You are, aren't you?

104
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:41,190
Counselling! Yes!
See?

105
00:05:41,257 --> 00:05:44,193
Perhaps Lilith and I could
provide some help.

106
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:47,196
Oh, that's nice, Doctor Crane.

107
00:05:47,263 --> 00:05:48,697
I'll-I'll ask Kelly.

108
00:05:48,764 --> 00:05:51,767
If she's not too busy
begging at airports

109
00:05:51,767 --> 00:05:54,970
or whatever those people do.

110
00:05:57,356 --> 00:05:59,341
I'll be finished
in about an hour.

111
00:05:59,408 --> 00:06:01,543
Tell me something.

112
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:04,113
You ever seen the ceiling
of a phone truck?

113
00:06:06,832 --> 00:06:08,601
Listen, buster.

114
00:06:08,668 --> 00:06:10,269
You get my phones working

115
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:12,605
or I'll come down on you
with a sexual harassment suit

116
00:06:12,606 --> 00:06:14,206
that'll make your head spin...

117
00:06:14,274 --> 00:06:17,209
that is if there's a neck
in there somewhere!

118
00:06:18,144 --> 00:06:19,411
All right! All right!

119
00:06:20,847 --> 00:06:22,981
Your service'll be back on
in a couple of hours!

120
00:06:24,484 --> 00:06:26,084
Lesbian, huh?

121
00:06:29,539 --> 00:06:32,557
You'd be surprised how many
of those I run into in a day.

122
00:06:34,944 --> 00:06:36,829
Who put a quarter in this bar

123
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:38,831
that I just finished varnishing?

124
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:42,467
I did.
Go ahead, try to pick it up.

125
00:06:42,535 --> 00:06:45,570
Well, I can't.
It's stuck in the varnish.

126
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:49,775
That's right, right!
You can't pick it up
no matter how hard you try!

127
00:06:49,843 --> 00:06:53,961
Why don't you guys
just go away and come back
tonight for the reopening.

128
00:06:53,962 --> 00:06:55,847
This is the way you treat us?
We come in to help you,

129
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:57,516
and now you kick us out?

130
00:06:57,517 --> 00:07:00,085
Two hours of putting
the Indian and the wooden lady

131
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:02,421
in dirty positions
is not helping.

132
00:07:02,489 --> 00:07:04,273
Tell you, fellas, if you want...

133
00:07:04,274 --> 00:07:06,741
you want to help out why don't
you go over and get Carla.

134
00:07:06,742 --> 00:07:09,845
She's at the bar
on Boylston-Mr. Pubb's, okay?

135
00:07:09,912 --> 00:07:12,681
Get her back here.
I want her an hour early.

136
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:14,182
We're gonna have that
ribbon-cutting ceremony. Sure thing, Sam.

137
00:07:14,183 --> 00:07:15,484
Done.

138
00:07:15,552 --> 00:07:16,652
Say, Normie. Hey.

139
00:07:16,653 --> 00:07:18,387
Want to stop on the
way for a sandwich?

140
00:07:18,388 --> 00:07:19,888
It's three blocks over-Boylston?

141
00:07:19,889 --> 00:07:21,323
No, no, no,
not to worry, Cliffy.

142
00:07:21,324 --> 00:07:23,592
I stuffed my pockets
with pretzels.

143
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:25,650
Something I learned
in the Boy Scouts...

144
00:07:25,651 --> 00:07:26,828
you've got to be prepared.

145
00:07:26,829 --> 00:07:28,464
Ah, you were in the
Boy Scouts, huh?

146
00:07:28,465 --> 00:07:29,965
Yeah, for about a week,
then I quit.

147
00:07:29,966 --> 00:07:33,769
How come?
- Well, there was some talk
about going on a hike.

148
00:07:52,005 --> 00:07:54,907
Hi.
Welcome to Mr. Pubb's.

149
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:56,208
My name is Carla.

150
00:07:56,209 --> 00:07:57,710
I'll be your server
for the evening.

151
00:07:57,711 --> 00:07:59,545
What can I get you?

152
00:07:59,612 --> 00:08:01,212
Give me a Scotch on the rocks.

153
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,315
An excellent choice, sir.

154
00:08:05,201 --> 00:08:06,568
That's great, Carla!

155
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:10,005
That's the first time you did it
without the Mr. Pubb's Handbook!

156
00:08:10,073 --> 00:08:12,174
Bite my pubb!

157
00:08:12,241 --> 00:08:16,428
Well, Carla,
you've really come
a long way in the past two weeks.

158
00:08:16,429 --> 00:08:17,529
Thank you, sir.

159
00:08:17,597 --> 00:08:19,865
A Scotch on the rocks
for table 12.

160
00:08:19,933 --> 00:08:21,500
Coming right up.

161
00:08:21,567 --> 00:08:23,652
So's my lunch.

162
00:08:26,572 --> 00:08:28,240
Boy, oh, boy!

163
00:08:29,475 --> 00:08:31,410
This place have
enough neon or what?

164
00:08:31,477 --> 00:08:34,212
Yeah, it looks like
the inside of a UFO in here.

165
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:38,116
No, actually, Norm,
they're quite different.

166
00:08:42,388 --> 00:08:44,823
I guess.

167
00:08:44,891 --> 00:08:46,161
Welcome to Mr. Pubb's. Hey.

168
00:08:46,162 --> 00:08:47,910
Someone will be here
in a moment to help you, friends.

169
00:08:47,911 --> 00:08:49,244
Just need a couple beers,
that's all.

170
00:08:49,245 --> 00:08:52,514
Oh, from which country?
We have over 200 to choose from.

171
00:08:52,515 --> 00:08:55,300
Well, what say, Cliffy?
Once around the world
and then home?

172
00:08:56,603 --> 00:08:58,554
All right.

173
00:09:00,122 --> 00:09:02,558
Oh, man, wow, look at this.

174
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:04,893
I mean, not only do they
have a video arcade

175
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:08,963
but they've got, uh,
ten big-screen TVs
right over there in the wall.

176
00:09:08,964 --> 00:09:11,866
Each one of them televising
a different game.

177
00:09:11,867 --> 00:09:14,519
Boy, I-I-I bet your neck,
though, will get really sore

178
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:17,422
moving your head back and forth
from game to game.

179
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:20,558
Try just moving your eyes.

180
00:09:22,561 --> 00:09:25,763
Hey!
Cool!

181
00:09:29,102 --> 00:09:31,103
Well, well, well!

182
00:09:31,171 --> 00:09:33,555
Where's your organ-grinder?

183
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:36,558
Right here.

184
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:42,631
I just mean, you know,
don't you feel kind of silly
in that outfit?

185
00:09:42,632 --> 00:09:44,502
Of course I feel silly
in this outfit.

186
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:46,218
I can't wait till my shift ends,

187
00:09:46,219 --> 00:09:48,553
so I can get my pay-check
and head back to Cheers.

188
00:09:48,554 --> 00:09:50,188
Carla, we have a birthday
at table four.

189
00:09:50,189 --> 00:09:51,756
Ooh, a birthday!

190
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:54,159
Ooh, a birthday!

191
00:09:57,096 --> 00:10:00,032
If you guys, if you guys ever,

192
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:03,368
ever say one word about what
you are about to see me do,

193
00:10:03,435 --> 00:10:05,370
the last thing you'll see

194
00:10:05,437 --> 00:10:08,373
is me takin' a bite out
of your still-beating hearts!

195
00:10:12,679 --> 00:10:13,779
Ready?

196
00:10:13,846 --> 00:10:15,446
One, two, three.

197
00:10:15,514 --> 00:10:21,787
♪ A happy, happy birthday
from Mr. Pubb to you ♪
♪ A happy, happy birthday
from Mr. Pubb to you! ♪

198
00:10:27,259 --> 00:10:30,195
Boy, poor Carla, huh?

199
00:10:30,262 --> 00:10:32,664
I'd hate to have
a job like that.

200
00:10:32,732 --> 00:10:36,868
Wearing a dorky uniform
out in the public all day.

201
00:10:39,538 --> 00:10:42,057
There but for the grace of God,
Norm.

202
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:44,910
Okay, overstuffed potato skins.

203
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:46,912
Hey, we didn't make fun of you.

204
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:48,914
No.

205
00:10:48,915 --> 00:10:49,981
These! These!

206
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:52,250
It's happy hour.
They're complimentary.

207
00:10:53,352 --> 00:10:54,786
What are you guys doing here
anyway?

208
00:10:54,787 --> 00:10:57,889
Sammy asked us to come by
to make sure you stopped
by Cheers early.

209
00:10:57,890 --> 00:10:59,958
I'll tell you, I can't wait
to get out of this hell-hole.

210
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:02,393
Carla,
could I see you a minute please?

211
00:11:02,394 --> 00:11:04,313
Yes, sir.

212
00:11:05,121 --> 00:11:09,284
Here's your pay-check
for the past two weeks.

213
00:11:09,285 --> 00:11:11,586
You had a rocky start, but,
at the rate you're improving,

214
00:11:11,587 --> 00:11:14,489
I think you might
just be up for a promotion
in the next month or so.

215
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:15,774
Seriously? Here at Mr. Pubb's,

216
00:11:15,775 --> 00:11:17,943
we believe in promoting
from within.

217
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:20,963
Wow!

218
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:24,867
I see you noticed our
Mr. Pubb's satisfied
customer bonus.

219
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:28,303
I never had a satisfied
customer bonus before.

220
00:11:28,371 --> 00:11:31,639
Come to think of it, I never
had a satisfied customer before.

221
00:11:32,173 --> 00:11:35,927
By the way, Carla, can you work
an extra couple hours tonight?

222
00:11:35,928 --> 00:11:37,028
We're a little short-handed.

223
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:38,329
You bet I can.

224
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:40,081
That's the Mr. Pubb's spirit,
Carla.

225
00:11:41,166 --> 00:11:44,836
Hey, listen, guys.
Something just came up. Hmm.

226
00:11:44,904 --> 00:11:47,194
Uh, you're gonna have
to tell Sammy that, uh,

227
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:49,041
I'm gonna be late tonight.
What?!

228
00:11:49,108 --> 00:11:51,476
Hey, come on, it's
Sammy's big opening night.

229
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:53,054
You're gonna break his heart.

230
00:11:53,112 --> 00:11:55,047
Just tell him
I'll explain later.

231
00:11:56,883 --> 00:11:58,550
Oh, that's amazing, Norm.

232
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:01,653
Carla's not gonna show up there
for Sammy's grand reopening.

233
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:05,958
Well, let's go back and, uh,
break the news
to him, I guess. Yeah.

234
00:12:05,959 --> 00:12:07,225
Wahba, wahba, wahba, everybody.

235
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:09,260
It's luau night
here at Mr. Pubb's,

236
00:12:09,328 --> 00:12:11,780
complete with complimentary
pupu platters.

237
00:12:23,476 --> 00:12:26,178
We're not going back
to Cheers, are we, Cliff?

238
00:12:28,864 --> 00:12:30,532
No, we are not.

239
00:12:42,291 --> 00:12:45,944
Hey, fellas,
look what I've got here.

240
00:12:45,945 --> 00:12:46,995
What's that?

241
00:12:46,996 --> 00:12:49,781
You know the bar
business is getting
more and more competitive.

242
00:12:49,782 --> 00:12:52,417
And I've been wracking my brains
trying to figure out
how I can compete.

243
00:12:52,418 --> 00:12:54,018
I think I've finally
got the answer.

244
00:12:54,019 --> 00:12:55,720
A toaster oven? Yeah.

245
00:12:55,721 --> 00:12:58,216
See what I'm gonna do
is I'm gonna put
some saltines in here,

246
00:12:58,216 --> 00:13:01,026
melt some
American cheese on top.

247
00:13:01,094 --> 00:13:04,696
Serve them to the customers,
buck a plate maybe.

248
00:13:05,715 --> 00:13:08,349
Well, there goes
my last reason for staying home.

249
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:11,286
Sam, you'd better
get started on those.

250
00:13:11,287 --> 00:13:13,155
The grand reopening
is in less than an hour.

251
00:13:13,156 --> 00:13:14,857
Whoa, you're kidding me.

252
00:13:14,924 --> 00:13:18,843
Where the hell are
Carla and the other guys?

253
00:13:18,844 --> 00:13:20,612
Hey, do me a favour,
will you fellas?

254
00:13:20,613 --> 00:13:24,800
Will you go over to that,
uh, Mr. Pubb's place
and, uh, bring 'em
all back please?

255
00:13:24,801 --> 00:13:27,319
- Oh, I don't know, Sammy.
- It really is kind of far, Sam.

256
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,620
Yeah, let them come
back on their own.

257
00:13:28,621 --> 00:13:29,821
All right, all right, all right,

258
00:13:29,822 --> 00:13:32,524
a complimentary plate
of cracker snacks in it for you.

259
00:13:32,525 --> 00:13:33,758
What do you say?

260
00:13:38,364 --> 00:13:39,548
Each?

261
00:13:39,615 --> 00:13:41,316
All right, all right, all right.

262
00:13:41,384 --> 00:13:42,718
You drive a hard bargain.

263
00:13:42,786 --> 00:13:44,386
Get out of here.

264
00:13:45,287 --> 00:13:46,771
Hi, everyone.

265
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:50,058
Kelly, I admire you for coming.

266
00:13:50,125 --> 00:13:52,711
Well, I believe a marriage
is worth saving.

267
00:13:52,712 --> 00:13:54,112
Well, that's not
all she believes.

268
00:13:54,113 --> 00:13:56,014
Ask her why she believes
the Book of Concord

269
00:13:56,015 --> 00:13:57,615
and the Scriptures are
on the same level.

270
00:13:57,616 --> 00:13:58,666
Go ahead, ask her.

271
00:13:58,684 --> 00:14:00,002
Because they're not.

272
00:14:01,204 --> 00:14:04,273
Ask her why the sacraments
are considered
vehicles of grace.

273
00:14:04,274 --> 00:14:05,340
Go ahead, I dare you.

274
00:14:05,408 --> 00:14:07,141
They're symbolic memorials.

275
00:14:07,209 --> 00:14:08,860
Heretic!

276
00:14:08,927 --> 00:14:10,979
Now, now...

277
00:14:11,046 --> 00:14:13,582
You two...

278
00:14:13,649 --> 00:14:16,585
Perhaps a page from Frasier's
and my personal history

279
00:14:16,652 --> 00:14:18,987
will calm the waters.

280
00:14:19,054 --> 00:14:21,990
Woody, Kelly.

281
00:14:22,057 --> 00:14:25,326
I am Jewish
and Frasier is Episcopalian.

282
00:14:25,395 --> 00:14:29,180
Now originally, we feared
this might cause
conflict in our marriage.

283
00:14:29,248 --> 00:14:31,066
But then we learned
to compromise,

284
00:14:31,134 --> 00:14:33,468
even in the raising
of our son, Frederick.

285
00:14:33,535 --> 00:14:35,103
We make sure he experiences

286
00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:37,706
both sides of his
religious heritage.

287
00:14:37,774 --> 00:14:39,924
As usual, my darling
wife is right.

288
00:14:39,992 --> 00:14:44,062
Frederick goes to synagogue
every Friday night.

289
00:14:44,129 --> 00:14:47,465
He delights in hiding
matzos at Passover.

290
00:14:47,533 --> 00:14:50,702
The family celebrates Hanukkah.

291
00:14:50,770 --> 00:14:55,590
Meanwhile,
Christmas comes and goes
without so much as a tree.

292
00:14:55,658 --> 00:14:57,909
Odd, really, because

293
00:14:57,910 --> 00:15:00,111
a Christmas tree isn't even
symbolic of Christianity.

294
00:15:00,112 --> 00:15:03,214
But apparently it threatens
Lilith's Jewish faith.

295
00:15:03,282 --> 00:15:06,517
Look out, everybody!
A fir tree!

296
00:15:07,953 --> 00:15:09,487
5,000-year-old religion,

297
00:15:09,488 --> 00:15:13,892
and Frasier Crane's
going to bring it down
with a four-foot tree
and some tinsel!

298
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,176
Excuse me.

299
00:15:15,244 --> 00:15:18,463
I'm just not sure
how this applies to us.

300
00:15:18,531 --> 00:15:22,784
Your religious
differences are extremely
inconsequential.

301
00:15:22,852 --> 00:15:25,220
One is reminded
of Gulliver's Travels

302
00:15:25,288 --> 00:15:26,888
in which two countries warred

303
00:15:26,956 --> 00:15:29,124
over which side
of an egg gets cracked:

304
00:15:29,192 --> 00:15:31,293
The narrow end
or the rounded end.

305
00:15:31,361 --> 00:15:34,465
Well, that's ridiculous.
Of course it's the rounded end.

306
00:15:34,496 --> 00:15:37,598
Oh, Kelly, I don't even
know who you are anymore!

307
00:15:43,039 --> 00:15:45,590
Sam, give me two beers
and a scotch on the rocks.

308
00:15:45,658 --> 00:15:47,426
I don't get it.

309
00:15:47,493 --> 00:15:51,129
Cheers is opening again
and none of my close
friends are here.

310
00:15:51,130 --> 00:15:54,032
That's because you've
sent everybody
over to Mr. Pubb's to get Carla,

311
00:15:54,099 --> 00:15:56,301
who, by the way,
is two hours late.

312
00:15:56,302 --> 00:15:57,903
You know what this
reminds me of?

313
00:15:57,904 --> 00:15:59,538
It reminds me
of that spooky movie,

314
00:15:59,539 --> 00:16:01,807
where those people
keep going into the barn

315
00:16:01,874 --> 00:16:04,175
and then they disappear.

316
00:16:04,243 --> 00:16:07,479
And so they send other people
to go in there
and they disappear.

317
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:10,649
And then, still others
go in the barn
and they disappear.

318
00:16:10,650 --> 00:16:14,352
And then they
find out that there's
a psycho killer in there
stabbing everybody.

319
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:16,187
What was the name of that movie?

320
00:16:16,255 --> 00:16:17,589
Don't Go In The Barn.

321
00:16:23,228 --> 00:16:25,547
This is crazy.

322
00:16:25,548 --> 00:16:27,883
I'm going over there right now
and bring them back.

323
00:16:27,884 --> 00:16:29,394
Hold down the fort, will you?

324
00:16:34,574 --> 00:16:36,841
Congratulations
on your reopening.

325
00:16:38,544 --> 00:16:42,898
Trust me,
one Lambada with Bernard,

326
00:16:42,965 --> 00:16:45,233
and you'll never
look at another woman.

327
00:16:47,569 --> 00:16:49,604
You don't get it, do you?

328
00:16:49,671 --> 00:16:51,940
We're born this way.

329
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:05,269
Wow.
All these big-screen TVs getting

330
00:17:05,337 --> 00:17:07,387
satellite feeds from
all over the world.

331
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:10,475
Yeah, well, Normie,
it is the information age.

332
00:17:10,543 --> 00:17:13,478
We can receive
up-to-the-minute stock prices,

333
00:17:13,546 --> 00:17:15,079
medical breakthroughs,

334
00:17:15,147 --> 00:17:18,216
political upheavals
from all around the globe.

335
00:17:18,283 --> 00:17:21,786
Of course we'd, uh,
have to turn off
the cartoons first.

336
00:17:23,156 --> 00:17:25,490
Oh, there you are! Hey, fellas!

337
00:17:25,558 --> 00:17:27,759
Hey, Sammy!

338
00:17:27,826 --> 00:17:29,427
What are you doing here?

339
00:17:29,428 --> 00:17:31,062
You're missing,
you know, the opening.

340
00:17:31,063 --> 00:17:32,230
What, it's that late already?

341
00:17:32,231 --> 00:17:33,501
Is it that late already?

342
00:17:33,502 --> 00:17:36,901
You telling me
you just been playing,
playing games around here

343
00:17:36,969 --> 00:17:39,571
and watch, watching the TVs?

344
00:17:39,572 --> 00:17:42,774
Sam we got caught up
in them, you know?

345
00:17:42,775 --> 00:17:45,243
Yeah, hey, Sammy, is
this place great or what, huh?

346
00:17:45,244 --> 00:17:47,512
Yeah, but so is a little
place called Cheers.

347
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:48,946
Or have you forgotten?

348
00:17:48,947 --> 00:17:50,715
Did you tell them
about the cracker snacks?

349
00:17:50,716 --> 00:17:54,085
I'm talking about
American cheese
on top of some saltines
and everything.

350
00:17:54,086 --> 00:17:55,520
Maybe 50 cents a plate.

351
00:17:55,588 --> 00:17:57,255
Can't beat that, huh?

352
00:17:57,322 --> 00:17:59,040
Excuse me! Hi!

353
00:17:59,108 --> 00:18:01,576
Happy hour ribs, complimentary.

354
00:18:03,596 --> 00:18:05,764
You, uh, you were saying, Sammy?

355
00:18:07,183 --> 00:18:09,117
Never mind. Never mind.

356
00:18:09,185 --> 00:18:12,570
Carla, hey, what're you doing?

357
00:18:12,571 --> 00:18:14,940
How come you're
still in uniform?
You're supposed to be at Cheers.

358
00:18:14,941 --> 00:18:17,008
Oh. I'm not going back, Sammy.

359
00:18:17,076 --> 00:18:18,860
What do you mean?
Well, I want to.

360
00:18:18,861 --> 00:18:21,480
I really do, but they're
paying me too much money here.

361
00:18:21,481 --> 00:18:22,714
I can't give it up.

362
00:18:22,782 --> 00:18:26,901
What are you saying?
Are you saying you're quitting?

363
00:18:26,969 --> 00:18:29,371
Well, when were you
gonna tell me? Never?

364
00:18:29,438 --> 00:18:31,806
I tried to call you,
but I couldn't get through.

365
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:35,443
And then I asked
the guys to tell you,
but none of them ever went back.

366
00:18:35,444 --> 00:18:37,362
Whoa, wait, wait, wait, wait-
this is crazy.

367
00:18:37,363 --> 00:18:40,031
You and I have been working
together for 14 years.

368
00:18:40,099 --> 00:18:42,366
Sammy, can't you be
happy for me?

369
00:18:42,402 --> 00:18:45,236
I mean, I've found a job
that pays me a lot of money.

370
00:18:45,304 --> 00:18:46,444
Fine, all right, fine!

371
00:18:46,445 --> 00:18:48,123
I'll tell you something,
you want to quit,

372
00:18:48,124 --> 00:18:51,126
you have the courtesy
to come to my bar
and tell me face-to-face.

373
00:18:51,127 --> 00:18:54,295
And until you do that,
I consider you still
employed at Cheers.

374
00:18:54,363 --> 00:18:57,532
Okay, fine!
I'll stop by to quit
as soon as I'm off.

375
00:18:57,599 --> 00:18:59,400
Yeah, you do that! Okay, I will!

376
00:18:59,468 --> 00:19:03,354
Yeah, fine! Fine!
Yeah, "fine" back!

377
00:19:03,423 --> 00:19:06,257
Hey, fellas, enjoy the ribs!

378
00:19:11,514 --> 00:19:14,282
You know, uh, American cheese

379
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:17,018
is one of the world's
finest cheeses.

380
00:19:18,036 --> 00:19:22,173
Melted on a saltine, that's a...
that's a party in your mouth.

381
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:25,826
Anybody feel like
maybe we should, uh,
walk on back to Cheers?

382
00:19:25,894 --> 00:19:27,512
Yeah, let's do that, huh?

383
00:19:29,532 --> 00:19:31,222
Okay.
Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait.

384
00:19:31,283 --> 00:19:32,550
Boys, be prepared.

385
00:19:39,025 --> 00:19:42,927
Hey, hey, hey, hey, Carla,
let me get this straight.

386
00:19:42,928 --> 00:19:44,645
You're really not
going back to Cheers?

387
00:19:44,646 --> 00:19:46,448
I know it's a lousy job, Norm,

388
00:19:46,449 --> 00:19:48,784
but for the amount of money
they're throwing at me,

389
00:19:48,785 --> 00:19:50,285
it's nothing I can't take.

390
00:19:52,355 --> 00:19:57,305
Carla, uh, I'm gonna put
a new trainee with you
for the next two weeks.

391
00:19:57,326 --> 00:19:58,493
She's a bright girl.

392
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:01,829
She's, uh, an anthropology
student at B.U.

393
00:20:01,898 --> 00:20:03,831
Ellen!

394
00:20:05,567 --> 00:20:07,668
Ellen, come meet Carla.

395
00:20:07,736 --> 00:20:11,273
Well, you must be Carla.

396
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:14,058
I know what you're thinking:

397
00:20:14,126 --> 00:20:17,712
"She doesn't
look like a waitress."

398
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:21,483
That's because
I'm really a writer.

399
00:20:21,551 --> 00:20:26,488
Or actuellement, a poetess.

400
00:20:36,448 --> 00:20:38,416
Well, Mr. Missouri Synod,

401
00:20:38,484 --> 00:20:40,051
you demanded to see me?

402
00:20:40,118 --> 00:20:42,887
Yeah, Kelly, uh, would you
please sit down here?

403
00:20:42,955 --> 00:20:44,889
Something very
important to tell you.

404
00:20:47,125 --> 00:20:50,362
Listen, uh, what's gone
on these last few days

405
00:20:50,429 --> 00:20:53,164
has affected me very deeply.

406
00:20:53,232 --> 00:20:55,133
I love you, Kelly.

407
00:20:55,201 --> 00:20:57,035
That's why...

408
00:20:57,103 --> 00:20:59,087
I'm now a member
of The Evangelical

409
00:20:59,155 --> 00:21:01,325
Lutheran Church
of America, just like you.

410
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:03,391
Oh, Woody!

411
00:21:03,459 --> 00:21:06,461
You've saved our marriage!

412
00:21:06,529 --> 00:21:09,714
What a wonderful sacrifice.

413
00:21:09,782 --> 00:21:11,515
Now when we die
and go to heaven,

414
00:21:11,583 --> 00:21:15,453
we won't be separated
by barbed wire and barking dogs.

415
00:21:17,790 --> 00:21:21,025
What was it exactly
that saved you, Woody?

416
00:21:21,093 --> 00:21:23,244
Well, something Dr. Crane said.

417
00:21:23,312 --> 00:21:26,998
That thing about how
true love can overcome
all differences?

418
00:21:27,066 --> 00:21:29,200
Not exactly.

419
00:21:29,268 --> 00:21:31,303
Uh, he took me aside
and said I'd better

420
00:21:31,304 --> 00:21:34,205
get used to giving in to you
on every point for
the rest of our lives

421
00:21:34,206 --> 00:21:36,607
if I ever wanted to see
you naked again.

422
00:21:38,928 --> 00:21:42,247
Well, he is a Ph.D., you know.

423
00:21:42,315 --> 00:21:44,182
Yes, dear.

424
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:46,484
Shall we resume our honeymoon?

425
00:21:46,551 --> 00:21:48,069
Yes, dear.

426
00:21:48,137 --> 00:21:52,223
Woody, today you are a man.

427
00:21:52,291 --> 00:21:54,108
Yes, dear.

428
00:21:56,011 --> 00:21:58,813
Hey, Carla,
I'm so glad you're back.

429
00:21:58,881 --> 00:22:00,748
Yeah, me, too, Sammy.

430
00:22:00,816 --> 00:22:03,935
Why won't you tell me,
you know, why you
left that place?

431
00:22:03,936 --> 00:22:06,671
Sammy, believe me,
you're better off not knowing.

432
00:22:06,739 --> 00:22:10,875
Just swear to me
you'll never
go back in that bar.

433
00:22:10,943 --> 00:22:13,228
Well, you're talking
like there was

434
00:22:13,295 --> 00:22:15,663
some sort of psycho killer
there or something.

435
00:22:15,731 --> 00:22:18,783
If only...

436
00:22:18,851 --> 00:22:21,886
Sammy, just swear to me
you won't go back.

437
00:22:21,954 --> 00:22:23,621
Okay. Well, I won't go. Okay.

438
00:22:23,622 --> 00:22:24,989
I'm just glad you're here.

439
00:22:24,990 --> 00:22:27,191
Yeah, isn't it funny
how things work out?

440
00:22:27,259 --> 00:22:31,029
I mean, you know,
if I'd stayed at Mr. Pubb's,
I would have
made a lot more money,

441
00:22:31,030 --> 00:22:33,320
but I never would have met
my date for tonight.

442
00:22:33,366 --> 00:22:34,549
Your date? Yeah.

443
00:22:39,187 --> 00:22:42,190
Ready to go, sweetheart? Mm-hmm.

444
00:22:42,258 --> 00:22:44,992
Last straight broad in America,

445
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:46,878
and Bernard's got her.

446
00:22:50,121 --> 00:23:10,879
translate
