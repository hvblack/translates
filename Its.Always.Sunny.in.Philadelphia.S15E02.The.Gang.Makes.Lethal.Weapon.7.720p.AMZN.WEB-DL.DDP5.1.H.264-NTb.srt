1
00:00:24,107 --> 00:00:25,595
This is unbelievable.

2
00:00:25,595 --> 00:00:28,930
It's an outrage.
It's un-American is what it is.

3
00:00:28,987 --> 00:00:30,745
I thought this was
a free country.

4
00:00:30,745 --> 00:00:34,289
Free. This is censorship.
That's what it is.

5
00:00:34,289 --> 00:00:37,116
What ever happened
to free speech, huh?
You tell me that.

6
00:00:37,116 --> 00:00:40,282
Frank, we're not
inside your head, man.
We don't know what the hell
you're talking about.

7
00:00:40,282 --> 00:00:43,751
Lethal Weapon 5
and 6are gone.

8
00:00:43,751 --> 00:00:47,922
-Huh? What do you mean
they're gone?
- They removed them
from the library.

9
00:00:47,922 --> 00:00:52,760
- They got pulled?
- Yeah. The lady said
they took them down
because of insensitivity.

10
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:57,692
Huh. Well, I'll be honest
with you guys,
I'm not sure how we, uh,
talked the local library
- into displaying those movies
in the first place.

11
00:00:57,692 --> 00:00:59,084
- Yeah.
- They were works of art.

12
00:00:59,084 --> 00:01:03,966
Well, well, yeah, I mean,
they would've been works of art
had Mac not ruined them
with his blackface.

13
00:01:03,966 --> 00:01:09,178
Okay. Look, uh, my heart
was in the right place,
and I-I-I feel awful
about it now.

14
00:01:09,178 --> 00:01:13,466
Look, you never should've
done it in the first place.
That was the whole point of the
conversation we were having.

15
00:01:13,466 --> 00:01:18,217
- I told you not to do it, man.
- I know, I know, but, look,
I've done a lot of learning
over the past year,
as we all have.

16
00:01:18,217 --> 00:01:20,169
- That's true.
We've also done
a lot of growing.

17
00:01:20,169 --> 00:01:23,078
- That's true.
- A lot of learning,
a lot of growing,

18
00:01:23,078 --> 00:01:24,744
- and a lot of being scared.
- Yeah.

19
00:01:24,744 --> 00:01:27,714
- And, guys, fear is a great
motivator to do the right thing.

20
00:01:27,714 --> 00:01:31,597
- Ooh.
- Yeah, yeah. Frank, look,
while it is, uh, awful
that they removed our movies,

21
00:01:31,597 --> 00:01:35,305
I think it's probably best
in this instance
to just let sleeping dogs lie.

22
00:01:35,305 --> 00:01:38,393
Yeah, yeah.
- Yes.
We'll just put them
in the past, and we'll move on.

23
00:01:38,393 --> 00:01:41,828
- Yeah, yeah.
- Guys, Lethal Weapon 5 and 6
are in the past.

24
00:01:41,828 --> 00:01:45,824
- Right.
Now we have
the path forward
and the knowledge
- to do the right thing.
- Mm-hmm.

25
00:01:45,824 --> 00:01:48,542
And I think it's obvious
what that right thing is.

26
00:01:48,542 --> 00:01:50,164
Make Lethal Weapon 7.

27
00:01:50,164 --> 00:01:52,447
- Yes.
- Absolutely.
- Right?
- Let's get going on it.

28
00:01:52,447 --> 00:01:55,083
- The show must go on, right?
- Yeah.

29
00:01:55,083 --> 00:01:58,099
LETHAL

30
00:02:15,656 --> 00:02:18,658
You know, as we all know, guys,
our Lethal Weapon movies

31
00:02:18,658 --> 00:02:22,400
were always intended
to be a trilogy that followed
a trilogy, plus a sequel,

32
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:27,317
but the most important thing
is making sure that this
third movie in a series of seven

33
00:02:27,317 --> 00:02:32,348
can be seen and enjoyed
by audiences
of today's moral
and ethical standards.

34
00:02:32,348 --> 00:02:35,079
- Mm-hmm.
- Right, because
the-the first time
- we made that one mistake,
and that was...
- Mm-hmm.

35
00:02:35,079 --> 00:02:38,776
Well, uh, actually two,
because you did blackface
in the sequel.

36
00:02:38,776 --> 00:02:40,709
- Oh.
- Ooh, right. The two mistakes.

37
00:02:40,709 --> 00:02:43,735
Yeah, well, uh,
so did Dee, actually.
Okay, so three, we--
three mistakes.

38
00:02:43,735 --> 00:02:49,179
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. But you've
also done multiple insensitive
characters in the past,
- you know, on and off-screen.

39
00:02:49,179 --> 00:02:51,874
I don't know if that's
going into the conversation
we're having here.
- It should.

40
00:02:51,874 --> 00:02:56,142
- Yeah, well, and Frank
did red-face in...
- What?
- It's also frowned upon.

41
00:02:56,142 --> 00:02:58,895
Six, seven, eight, nine, ten mistakes.
Guys, let's not get into it,

42
00:02:58,909 --> 00:03:02,877
because Hollywood
has a very clear moral code
- on mistakes.

43
00:03:02,877 --> 00:03:06,634
Okay, you get one, right?
Like Woody Allen, right?
Roman Polanski.

44
00:03:06,634 --> 00:03:08,273
One mistake and that was it.

45
00:03:08,273 --> 00:03:12,076
Uh, no, actually, those guys
continued to make films
for the next 40 years.

46
00:03:12,076 --> 00:03:15,420
- Oh. Uh, Bill Cosby.
- Well, he made about
50 mistakes.

47
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:18,217
And-and I would
actually argue that
all these things
we're talking about,

48
00:03:18,291 --> 00:03:22,851
they-they weren't
so much mistakes
as they were
violent sexual crimes.

49
00:03:22,851 --> 00:03:25,113
- Right.
- You know, but either way,
look, the point is,

50
00:03:25,183 --> 00:03:28,683
I think we should make
a few adjustments
to the script, you know,
and to our casting choices,

51
00:03:28,683 --> 00:03:32,422
to make sure that this film is
palatable to a modern audience.

52
00:03:32,422 --> 00:03:34,759
Okay, as long as I get to
bang the broad.

53
00:03:34,759 --> 00:03:37,608
- Jesus.
- Uh, I think
we might want
to avoid that, as well.

54
00:03:37,608 --> 00:03:39,667
- How about a blow job then?
- Um...

55
00:03:39,988 --> 00:03:43,503
Look, a hand job
or I'm not paying for this.

56
00:03:43,503 --> 00:03:47,984
- That's a very important part
of the filmmaking process.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

57
00:03:47,984 --> 00:03:51,168
- I ain't paying for it
unless I get a hand job.
- Fine. You can get a hand job,

58
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:54,406
but it's got to be under
a towel or a blanket
because I don't want to see
your genitalia.

59
00:03:54,406 --> 00:03:56,892
Can-can-can we just talk about
the elephant in the room?

60
00:03:56,892 --> 00:03:58,224
Right? Let's talk
about Murtaugh.

61
00:03:58,224 --> 00:04:03,581
- Now, uh, obviously,
I will not be playing Murtaugh
in Lethal Weapon 7.

62
00:04:05,392 --> 00:04:08,870
- Right.
- Yeah.
O-Okay.

63
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:12,778
I will be magnanimously
taking a step back.

64
00:04:12,847 --> 00:04:14,210
- Right.

65
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:17,717
I feel like you're
talking really slow
and taking a bunch of pauses.
I don't know what's going on.

66
00:04:17,717 --> 00:04:20,350
I-I'm waiting for you guys
to praise me.
- Why?

67
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:24,309
Oh, 'cause I'm doing
something anti-racist,
and I think I deserve praise
for that, do I not?

68
00:04:24,309 --> 00:04:27,211
You don't get praise for telling
people you're not racist.

69
00:04:27,211 --> 00:04:28,970
- Then why am I doing it?

70
00:04:31,056 --> 00:04:34,445
Why don't we just
move on from this, guys?
Uh, let's move past that.
Yeah.

71
00:04:34,445 --> 00:04:35,572
- Yeah. All right.
- Yeah.
- Yes, please.

72
00:04:35,572 --> 00:04:37,811
Let's make the movie.
- Let's make a movie!
- Let's dive in.

73
00:04:37,811 --> 00:04:40,149
- Yeah, it's gonna be easy.
- Okay. Let's make a movie.

74
00:04:40,192 --> 00:04:42,193
- It's gonna be fun.
- We're over,
we're overthinking it.

75
00:04:43,422 --> 00:04:49,600
PARK

76
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,680
G'day, former partner.
Sorry I'm a little late.

77
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:55,778
I got stuck up on
some traffic on the 405.

78
00:04:55,778 --> 00:05:00,363
Yeah, I got off at Sepulveda,
and then I-I made my way
over to Moorpark.

79
00:05:00,363 --> 00:05:02,914
From there, I sort of
wiggled down to Tujunga,

80
00:05:02,914 --> 00:05:06,170
then I ticky-tackied over
to the, to the Laurel Canyon.

81
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:09,708
Oh, my God, what is she doing?
That accent is terrible.

82
00:05:09,708 --> 00:05:12,402
And what's with
all the directions?
Why is she explaining so much?

83
00:05:12,402 --> 00:05:16,104
- Well...
- Oh, yeah.
W-We found that people
had, uh, no idea

84
00:05:16,104 --> 00:05:19,302
where the characters were
in the first two,
so we thought we'd clear it up.

85
00:05:19,302 --> 00:05:22,547
Everyone was confused about
where things were happening
and what things were happening.

86
00:05:22,547 --> 00:05:24,511
- Where props came from,
et cetera.
- Sure, sure.

87
00:05:24,511 --> 00:05:25,956
- Well, hopefully,
Murtaugh's good.
- Yeah.

88
00:05:25,956 --> 00:05:27,455
Oh, who-who did you wind up
getting for that?

89
00:05:27,455 --> 00:05:30,693
Oh, well, so, Frank
went under the bridge to get
a prostitute for his sex scene.

90
00:05:30,693 --> 00:05:32,742
He talked the pimp
into playing Murtaugh,

91
00:05:32,742 --> 00:05:35,943
so, you know,
some guy named Pepper Jack,
or something like that. Yeah.

92
00:05:35,943 --> 00:05:39,441
- Pepper Jack?
- Yeah, you know this guy?

93
00:05:39,441 --> 00:05:43,078
- Yeah.
All right.
- Oh, cool.

94
00:05:43,964 --> 00:05:46,501
That's okay, partner.
I'm just glad you're here.

95
00:05:46,501 --> 00:05:48,700
- Let's start the party now.
- Yeah.

96
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:51,629
Happy birthday, little baby ho.
I wish your ho mama--

97
00:05:51,629 --> 00:05:55,441
Riggs' wife-- and my daughter
could be here to see this,
but she died.

98
00:05:55,441 --> 00:05:58,066
Run along and play,
little bitch.

99
00:06:00,542 --> 00:06:02,058
Have fun.

100
00:06:02,058 --> 00:06:05,629
Now, this is all wrong. I mean,
he's playing it like a pimp.
- Well, he is a pimp.

101
00:06:05,629 --> 00:06:08,020
- So, give him the note.
- So, you...
- Give him the note.

102
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:09,717
- Just tell him to tone it...
Yeah,
tell him to tone it down.

103
00:06:09,717 --> 00:06:12,048
- You mean...
- Yeah.
You guys can give it to him.

104
00:06:12,048 --> 00:06:14,103
- No, you give it to him
'cause you're the director.
- Yeah.

105
00:06:14,103 --> 00:06:17,909
- Oh. What's that?
You know what? It's me phone.

106
00:06:17,909 --> 00:06:21,182
- It's been in my pocket
the whole time.
- Well, go ahead,
answer it, bitch.

107
00:06:21,182 --> 00:06:22,918
- Yeah. Okay.

108
00:06:23,627 --> 00:06:25,372
G'day. How you going?

109
00:06:25,372 --> 00:06:28,023
Sorry to interrupt, boys.

110
00:06:28,023 --> 00:06:31,185
I hope you're having
as much fun as I am.

111
00:06:31,185 --> 00:06:36,013
I know we all enjoy
a big bang.

112
00:06:36,013 --> 00:06:39,892
Wait, wait, wait.
Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut.
This ain't working for me.

113
00:06:39,892 --> 00:06:43,443
- It's not working for me.
- Cut. Okay.
- It's just not working.
- Okay, cut,
- cut, cut, cut, cut. No.
'Cause, uh...

114
00:06:43,443 --> 00:06:46,023
- Guys, take five.
- Yeah, I say that.
I say, "Take five."

115
00:06:46,023 --> 00:06:47,601
Also, I say,
"Cut," guys, 'cause I am the,
I'm the director.

116
00:06:47,601 --> 00:06:51,155
Okay, listen.
Listen, Frank.
I agree. It's not working.
Okay, Dee is terrible.

117
00:06:51,155 --> 00:06:55,005
Okay. She's terrible,
but it's not her, it's my thing.
I'm talking about--

118
00:06:55,005 --> 00:06:58,441
Look,
like, first of all, it's just,
you know, I say, "Big bang."

119
00:06:58,441 --> 00:06:59,704
I ain't even banging this chick.

120
00:06:59,704 --> 00:07:02,112
Yeah, that's a good point.
It's continuity.
Doesn't make sense.

121
00:07:02,112 --> 00:07:04,082
You're right.
Okay, maybe you could say,

122
00:07:04,082 --> 00:07:06,840
"I'm sick of getting
jerked around.
- I'm ready to explode."
- Yeah.

123
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:10,456
Look, I don't think
it's too much to ask
for me to have
a little real stuff.

124
00:07:10,456 --> 00:07:13,572
Okay, listen, Frank,
you should not be actually
having sex with anybody.

125
00:07:13,572 --> 00:07:15,797
It's called acting, Dennis.
- No. Mm.

126
00:07:15,797 --> 00:07:20,182
- Marlon Brando
got to jam butter
up his costar's orifice

127
00:07:20,182 --> 00:07:23,824
against her will
and got nominated for an Oscar.

128
00:07:23,824 --> 00:07:25,789
We could make this
more of an art house film.

129
00:07:25,789 --> 00:07:29,353
- I'm open to it.
She is a prostitute,
so I don't know
- what the rules are...
- I don't want butter
to get involved.

130
00:07:29,353 --> 00:07:31,361
Uh,
excuse me, gents.

131
00:07:31,361 --> 00:07:34,023
So, uh, how'd I do?

132
00:07:34,023 --> 00:07:39,197
- Oh, Mac. Yeah, you were, uh...
- Yeah, Mac had a note.
- You were gonna give some notes.
- Yes. Uh, yes. Uh...

133
00:07:39,574 --> 00:07:42,865
What's this?
Now, I hope you're not, uh,
hating on Pepper Jack's flow?

134
00:07:42,865 --> 00:07:45,428
No. No, no,
I'm not hating on your...

135
00:07:45,428 --> 00:07:50,414
I mean, I feel, like,
I'm-I'm in the way here.
- Are my headphones working?
- Well, you guys,
you're not in the way.
- Are yours, are yours working?
- You guys are... Yeah.

136
00:07:50,414 --> 00:07:53,798
Um, no. I-I think what--
Your flow is great. I think
what you're doing's great.

137
00:07:53,798 --> 00:07:58,270
The thing is,
maybe this next take,
you could do it
a little bit more...

138
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:00,197
A little more...

139
00:08:00,197 --> 00:08:03,168
-...Pepper Jack.
- Yeah.
A little bit more Pepper Jack.

140
00:08:03,168 --> 00:08:06,174
- That's what I was thinking.
- Okay.
- Yeah. Okay.
- Well, okay then.

141
00:08:06,174 --> 00:08:08,455
- Now we cooking. All right.
- Okay. We're cooking.

142
00:08:08,455 --> 00:08:10,409
- Thank you, Pepper Jack.
Thank you.
- Hey, no problem, man.

143
00:08:10,409 --> 00:08:11,624
- Little more Pepper Jack.

144
00:08:11,624 --> 00:08:14,121
Hey, man, you didn't give him the note.

145
00:08:14,121 --> 00:08:20,021
Yeah. Well...
Guys, look, I-I just don't think
we should be silencing
Black voices.

146
00:08:20,021 --> 00:08:21,787
Guys, there's a larger issue
at play here,

147
00:08:21,787 --> 00:08:25,482
and that is that all the
people of color that we know
are people of the bridges
and the streets, okay?

148
00:08:25,482 --> 00:08:30,600
Look, they're pimps and
prostitutes, which, I tell you,
says a lot more about us
than it does about them,
that's for sure.

149
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,231
- That's not a great look.
- That's not...

150
00:08:32,313 --> 00:08:35,719
We're gonna have to do
some real soul-searching.
- We should really open up our...
Yeah, absolutely.

151
00:08:35,719 --> 00:08:40,708
We got to dig real deep
into our contacts,
and we got to find, like,
diverse voices that don't...

152
00:08:40,708 --> 00:08:45,573
- Uh, oh, guys, actually,
I think I know how to kill
two birds with one stone.

153
00:08:48,214 --> 00:08:50,408
Thank you for the opportunity,

154
00:08:50,408 --> 00:08:54,951
and I'm hip to your hustle.
Bringing a woman of color
to spice things up.

155
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:57,699
Wait, where-where is she?
Where is she?

156
00:08:57,699 --> 00:09:01,024
The woman of color?
Is right here.

157
00:09:01,024 --> 00:09:03,836
You're a woman of color?
Yeah, I'm Persian.

158
00:09:03,836 --> 00:09:07,013
That's the ethnicity
from Iran. Hello?

159
00:09:07,013 --> 00:09:09,061
He's, uh, ignorant.

160
00:09:09,061 --> 00:09:13,950
- Anyway, there's a dearth of Iranian
female directors, so thank you.

161
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:17,216
Yeah, uh, to be clear, you
will be the assistant director.

162
00:09:17,216 --> 00:09:20,896
Okay, we'll see.
Now, let's talk about payment.

163
00:09:20,896 --> 00:09:23,155
I will accept

164
00:09:23,155 --> 00:09:26,227
coins, cash,
checks,

165
00:09:26,227 --> 00:09:29,912
food, vape pens,
pens in general, scissors.

166
00:09:29,912 --> 00:09:31,997
Sure. Let's-let's move on
from this.

167
00:09:31,997 --> 00:09:35,445
Uh, guys, uh...
I made a few changes
to the script

168
00:09:35,445 --> 00:09:38,000
because Dee was, well,
she was terrible.
Oh, I could see that.

169
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,744
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
So I sent her out to lunch,
and I'd like to shoot
before she gets back.

170
00:09:40,744 --> 00:09:41,927
- So can we do that?
- Let's do this.

171
00:09:41,927 --> 00:09:43,472
Let's shoot. Okay, guys,
let's get to places.

172
00:09:43,472 --> 00:09:45,471
Okay, guys, let's get to places.

173
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:49,827
- Uh, well, I--
That's what the director...
- Well, let's get to places.
Let's get to places.
Director in the house.

174
00:09:49,827 --> 00:09:53,166
- Okay, fine.
I'll give the note.
- Can you just let her speak?
- Well, you-- Okay. Uh, yes.
- Can you let her speak?

175
00:09:53,166 --> 00:09:55,424
EXT

176
00:09:55,424 --> 00:09:58,945
Wow.
Good day, former partner.
Sorry I'm late.

177
00:09:58,945 --> 00:10:02,604
I-I got a little up-jammed
traffic on the 504,

178
00:10:02,604 --> 00:10:05,160
uh, 450, on the highway.

179
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:09,597
Uh, I got off on "Spelly-ba-da,"
but I took that all the way down
to Moorpark.

180
00:10:09,597 --> 00:10:12,682
And then I took that down
to "Ta-ca-ha" Cucamonga.

181
00:10:12,682 --> 00:10:16,100
And then I tackied all the way
over to Laurel Canyon. Ticky.

182
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:17,800
Uh, this is gonna be tough
to cut around.

183
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:20,163
Artemis, did-did
you give Pepper Jack the note?

184
00:10:20,163 --> 00:10:23,696
Yes. Yeah, I simply asked him
if he's ever been
to a child's birthday party.

185
00:10:23,696 --> 00:10:28,369
He said yes.
I said, "Take us to that place.
Make it authentic
to your experience."

186
00:10:28,369 --> 00:10:32,624
What? What do you mean
this is not my kid?
Are you motherfuckers
kidding me?

187
00:10:32,624 --> 00:10:35,201
I've been paying child support
for five years,

188
00:10:35,201 --> 00:10:37,218
and Pepper Jack's
pullout game is strong.

189
00:10:37,218 --> 00:10:40,213
So, if I don't get
some answers real fast,

190
00:10:40,213 --> 00:10:42,804
Pepper Jack about to cut
all of y'all.

191
00:10:42,804 --> 00:10:45,017
Oh. Oh, shit.
Go with it, Charlie.
We can use it.

192
00:10:45,017 --> 00:10:46,675
What's next? Come on. The phone.

193
00:10:46,675 --> 00:10:48,279
The phone. The phone.
We're going to the phone bit.

194
00:10:48,279 --> 00:10:49,864
Fix it, Charlie. Fix it.
- All right, yeah.

195
00:10:49,864 --> 00:10:53,116
Oh, man, I would cut,
I would cut someone, too. Damn.

196
00:10:53,116 --> 00:10:55,393
Yeah, I'm sure you do have a
good pullout game, Pepper Jack.

197
00:10:55,393 --> 00:10:59,649
Uh-oh. What's that?
This is phone,
that I've whole had
on me this time.

198
00:10:59,649 --> 00:11:03,150
Uh, hello, who's this?
It's Charlie-- uh, Riggs.

199
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:05,911
Sorry to interrupt, boys.

200
00:11:05,911 --> 00:11:07,406
- I hope you're having as much...

201
00:11:07,406 --> 00:11:10,702
- Honey, what is the matter?
- Uh, I'm fine.
Keep going, keep going.

202
00:11:10,702 --> 00:11:12,214
I don't think your dick work.

203
00:11:12,214 --> 00:11:16,063
He might need an anal stimulant.
Candy, get the butter!

204
00:11:16,063 --> 00:11:19,270
No! No butter.
There's no butter involved.

205
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:20,772
What about
the Brando thing, Frank?

206
00:11:20,772 --> 00:11:23,019
- It don't work the other way.
- Yeah, it does.

207
00:11:23,019 --> 00:11:27,092
Uh, Frank?
You gonna have to
pay Pepper Jack,
whether you bust a nut or not.

208
00:11:27,092 --> 00:11:28,071
You understand that, don't you?

209
00:11:28,071 --> 00:11:30,290
I don't know what's happening.
Are we still in the scene?

210
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:33,085
That's my Fraggle Rock thermos.
He stole that from me.

211
00:11:33,085 --> 00:11:36,608
Wh... What's this?
Are you guys
shooting without me?

212
00:11:36,673 --> 00:11:38,861
- Dee's here.
- C-Cut.
- Goddamn it, Dee!

213
00:11:38,861 --> 00:11:40,276
- Cut.
- Yeah, cut.
- Cut.

214
00:11:40,276 --> 00:11:41,900
- Goddamn it, Dennis.

215
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:43,484
- Let's take a five, everybody.
- Let's take a five.

216
00:11:43,484 --> 00:11:46,329
Listen. Guys, none of this
is working.
You think we got to fire
Pepper Jack?

217
00:11:46,329 --> 00:11:49,389
No, no, no, no, no.
His anger and intensity
are-are good, you know?

218
00:11:49,389 --> 00:11:51,647
Just... not for
this role.

219
00:11:51,647 --> 00:11:53,444
I think we need
to recast Murtaugh.

220
00:11:53,444 --> 00:11:56,398
We need someone lovable,
someone versatile,

221
00:11:56,398 --> 00:12:00,972
someone with the skill, range,
and talent of one of the best
actors of our generation.

222
00:12:00,972 --> 00:12:02,534
We need Don Cheadle.

223
00:12:02,534 --> 00:12:07,663
You know Don Cheadle?
No. But I know the guy
that plays him.

224
00:12:07,664 --> 00:12:10,712
TAKE 3

225
00:12:12,617 --> 00:12:15,913
Hey, partner. Happy you made it.

226
00:12:15,913 --> 00:12:19,454
Oh, sorry I'm late.
People be driving
like bitches on the 405.

227
00:12:19,454 --> 00:12:23,791
- And my level of intensity
is because I am crazy
on account of my wife's murder.

228
00:12:23,791 --> 00:12:26,784
In case anybody is feeling
uncomfortable about it.

229
00:12:26,784 --> 00:12:29,993
I think this is working.
This is, like, way better.

230
00:12:29,993 --> 00:12:32,970
That's okay.
I'm just glad you're here.

231
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:36,822
Man... Whew.
We getting too old
for this shit, huh?

232
00:12:36,822 --> 00:12:38,124
Well, yeah, we are.

233
00:12:38,124 --> 00:12:41,357
Hey. Happy birthday, baby girl.

234
00:12:43,284 --> 00:12:47,445
I-I know I haven't always
been there for you,

235
00:12:48,433 --> 00:12:50,643
but I want you to know

236
00:12:50,643 --> 00:12:54,821
I'm always,
always with you.

237
00:12:54,821 --> 00:12:59,097
Right here.
In your heart.

238
00:13:00,466 --> 00:13:02,465
- Whoa, he's really good.
- He's good.

239
00:13:02,465 --> 00:13:04,199
- He's really good.
- He's the-- he's a real actor.

240
00:13:04,199 --> 00:13:08,410
- Okay. Here comes
our new villain, guys.
Fingers crossed it works.

241
00:13:08,781 --> 00:13:12,562
Hold that thought, son.
My shit be blowing up.

242
00:13:12,909 --> 00:13:14,271
Talk to me.

243
00:13:14,271 --> 00:13:18,856
Excuse me?
What are you doing in this park
in my neighborhood?

244
00:13:18,856 --> 00:13:23,355
- Who is this, bitch?
- It's Karen. Karen White.

245
00:13:23,355 --> 00:13:26,576
And I live in this neighborhood,
and I am sure that you do not.

246
00:13:26,576 --> 00:13:30,811
And if you don't leave right
now, I will call the police,
and I will tell them
you attacked me.

247
00:13:30,811 --> 00:13:33,124
I just don't understand
how this is a villain.

248
00:13:33,124 --> 00:13:38,300
Well, one of the last socially
acceptable groups to villainize

249
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:40,825
It's just, like,
making me uncomfortable.
You know what I mean?

250
00:13:40,825 --> 00:13:43,917
- It's not fun, is it?
- It's no fun.
- No. She's a cunt. She's a cunt.
- You want our movie to be fun.

251
00:13:43,917 --> 00:13:46,277
She's a little bit cunty.
It's just too real.

252
00:13:46,277 --> 00:13:48,572
Damn it, guys.
I really wanted this to work.

253
00:13:48,572 --> 00:13:53,860
I really did,
but maybe putting up
any group of people as villains
these days is potentially
problematic. I don't know.

254
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:58,215
Maybe-maybe villains
shouldn't be people at all, huh?

255
00:13:58,215 --> 00:14:02,814
Wait, you're
totally right. Right?
Like wh-- Like what
if we make the villain,
like, a big dog
or something, right?

256
00:14:02,814 --> 00:14:05,572
Or a bunch of raccoons
stacked up in a trench coat?
You know?

257
00:14:05,572 --> 00:14:08,500
Or a trench coat
full of bees flying around?
- Like, that would scare me.
Imagine seeing that.

258
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,771
- Bees! Bees are cool.
- Bees are scary.

259
00:14:10,771 --> 00:14:15,590
- What about,
like, a plague?
An act of God.
All the best villains
in the Bible were acts of God.

260
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:18,488
- A tsunami.

261
00:14:18,488 --> 00:14:22,778
Ooh, but, you know what?
Let's call it a tidal wave.
That feels
less racially charged.

262
00:14:22,778 --> 00:14:26,664
- Yeah. Right, right.
- I don't want to say that--
I don't want to say
that all waves are Asian.

263
00:14:26,664 --> 00:14:29,391
Yeah, you want to make sure
that waves are, you know...
- Just neutral.

264
00:14:29,391 --> 00:14:32,900
- Yeah. Not-not culturally...
- That's good, that's good.
- Um...

265
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:35,828
TAKE 4

266
00:14:37,996 --> 00:14:40,446
Hey, happy birthday, baby girl.

267
00:14:40,446 --> 00:14:43,853
I know I haven't always
been there for you.

268
00:14:43,853 --> 00:14:48,681
But...
I'm always with you.

269
00:14:48,681 --> 00:14:53,308
Right here,
in your heart.

270
00:14:55,742 --> 00:14:57,798
Uh, h-hold all that crying, man.

271
00:14:57,798 --> 00:15:00,746
Let me-- I-I--
My shit be blowing up.
Yeah, yeah. Go on.

272
00:15:02,843 --> 00:15:06,133
Oh. It says, "Look behind you."

273
00:15:06,753 --> 00:15:11,643
- Oh, no!
Tidal wave!
Where'd that come from?

274
00:15:11,643 --> 00:15:15,497
Well, no country specifically.
Just an act of God, I guess.

275
00:15:15,497 --> 00:15:19,222
No God specifically,
just the universe
or whatever.

276
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:25,813
- This is a piece of shit.
- Yeah.

277
00:15:26,157 --> 00:15:30,168
- I can't work like this.
- We can't even
get past the first scene.

278
00:15:30,168 --> 00:15:32,873
Well, I don't know what
the point of making a movie is
if we can't even be in it.

279
00:15:32,873 --> 00:15:34,127
- Yeah, or bang whores.

280
00:15:34,127 --> 00:15:35,723
All right, guys, listen.
We can still do this.

281
00:15:35,723 --> 00:15:39,474
Okay, what about this?
What if Riggs and Murtaugh
start to shoot out a path

282
00:15:39,474 --> 00:15:44,375
so that the tidal wave moves
to a field that's been
decimated by climate change.

283
00:15:44,375 --> 00:15:46,451
- That doesn't even
make any sense.
- Climate change? That's so dumb.

284
00:15:46,451 --> 00:15:47,872
That sucks, man. I don't want
to watch that movie.

285
00:15:47,872 --> 00:15:52,535
Guys, I know it's not great,
all right?
But it's the right thing to do,
and we have to do
the right thing.

286
00:15:52,535 --> 00:15:55,249
Since when do you care
about doing the right thing?

287
00:15:55,249 --> 00:15:57,863
Guys, guys, listen, listen.
Over the course
of the last year,

288
00:15:57,863 --> 00:16:00,673
I've learned to listen,
to not talk, to grow.

289
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:02,363
Guys, I'm woke.

290
00:16:02,363 --> 00:16:05,881
Okay? Now, let me tell you
how I reached this awakening.

291
00:16:06,175 --> 00:16:11,655
I was on a date, and, as usual,
I fibbed about my age a bit
so I could score
a younger prospect.

292
00:16:11,655 --> 00:16:15,893
The woman was in her 20s,
and the date
was going quite well,
or so I thought.

293
00:16:15,893 --> 00:16:19,228
It becomes just, like, so clear

294
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:23,809
that the patriarchy
is-is really just
an off-shoot of privilege.

295
00:16:23,809 --> 00:16:26,803
Uh, 100%. Yeah.
No, I-- Yeah. Um...

296
00:16:26,803 --> 00:16:30,725
You know, you have
the most beautiful eyes.
- Thanks. D--

297
00:16:30,725 --> 00:16:33,400
Don't you agree with what
I was just saying, though?

298
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:36,248
Abso-- Yeah. Tot-- I mean, yeah.
Whatever.

299
00:16:36,248 --> 00:16:39,598
- Whatever?
- Listen, can...
can we just keep this light,
you know?

300
00:16:39,598 --> 00:16:43,855
I'm-I'm less interested
in politics
and more interested
in what makes you tick.

301
00:16:43,855 --> 00:16:48,308
Oh, my God.
Oh, you're gross. God.

302
00:16:48,308 --> 00:16:51,327
The young generation
on the left seemed to be
a tough nut to crack,

303
00:16:51,327 --> 00:16:54,677
so I turned my attention
to the youth of the right.

304
00:16:54,677 --> 00:16:57,145
Socialists are ripping away
our freedom.
- Totally.

305
00:16:57,145 --> 00:17:00,839
- It's a slippery slope
until we are living
in a failed welfare state.

306
00:17:00,839 --> 00:17:04,327
Right. Hey, what do you say
we get out of here
and get into our own
slippery state?

307
00:17:04,327 --> 00:17:06,600
You know what I mean, Lisa?
No.

308
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:09,008
I'm talking about us banging,
you conservative little minx.

309
00:17:09,008 --> 00:17:10,753
Pig.

310
00:17:10,753 --> 00:17:12,833
I was learning.

311
00:17:12,833 --> 00:17:17,390
This generation
is more socially active
on both sides
of the aisle, so...

312
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:19,832
this time, I engaged.

313
00:17:19,832 --> 00:17:21,492
- I mean, don't you agree?
- Yes.

314
00:17:21,492 --> 00:17:23,829
We need to allow others
a chance to speak for once.

315
00:17:23,829 --> 00:17:28,692
Well, yes, but even
by saying, "Allow,"
you're implying that
you have all the power.

316
00:17:28,692 --> 00:17:31,103
Uh, but I thought you were
saying I did have the power?

317
00:17:31,103 --> 00:17:34,049
Are you twisting my words?
No. I'm just, uh...

318
00:17:34,049 --> 00:17:37,175
I'm just trying to understand
what the hell you're
talking about. I-I can't follow.

319
00:17:37,175 --> 00:17:40,522
See? This is exactly
what old people always do.

320
00:17:40,522 --> 00:17:41,638
- Old people?
- Uh-huh.

321
00:17:41,638 --> 00:17:43,332
I'm 26.

322
00:17:43,332 --> 00:17:47,791
But my rational thinking
and my desire for an open
dialogue were a dead giveaway.

323
00:17:47,791 --> 00:17:50,081
It was all starting
to make sense.

324
00:17:50,081 --> 00:17:53,671
See, this generation
doesn't even understand
half the shit
that they're saying.

325
00:17:53,671 --> 00:17:55,408
They aren't
more ethical than us.

326
00:17:55,408 --> 00:17:58,231
They just want
to be perceived as such.

327
00:17:58,231 --> 00:18:00,811
And who could blame them?
I mean, they've spent
their entire adult lives

328
00:18:00,811 --> 00:18:04,303
only 280 characters away
from being tweeted
into oblivion.

329
00:18:04,303 --> 00:18:07,500
Either way,
I took a new tack...

330
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:11,613
We need to use our privilege
as much as we
possibly can to protect people.

331
00:18:11,613 --> 00:18:13,132
How can you not see that?

332
00:18:13,132 --> 00:18:18,645
We need to use our privilege
to protect people
as much as we can.

333
00:18:18,645 --> 00:18:20,993
How can I not see that?

334
00:18:20,993 --> 00:18:24,800
- Because if we don't, who will?
- Because if we don't, who will?

335
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:29,545
Exactly. What we need
is a revolution.

336
00:18:29,545 --> 00:18:34,663
Simply regurgitating
back to them
exactly what they're saying
to each other
in their ridiculous
echo chambers
is all they want.

337
00:18:34,663 --> 00:18:37,129
And then, we can get
what we want.

338
00:18:37,129 --> 00:18:39,505
Yes, Daddy!

339
00:18:40,137 --> 00:18:41,963
- Daddy!

340
00:18:44,243 --> 00:18:49,100
Oh, also they're riddled
with insecurity
and have serious daddy issues,
so that helps.

341
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:51,151
Guys, we have to listen
to the young.

342
00:18:51,151 --> 00:18:55,969
Otherwise,
we are doomed to have sex
with only old people
for the rest of our lives,

343
00:18:55,969 --> 00:18:58,035
and I won't do that.
- No.

344
00:18:58,035 --> 00:19:01,092
- Right.
I never thought about that, man.

345
00:19:01,092 --> 00:19:02,590
So, you know what I say?

346
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:06,610
Finger on the pulse,
finger on the puss.

347
00:19:08,522 --> 00:19:09,924
- Ew.
- That's gross.

348
00:19:09,924 --> 00:19:12,429
- I see what you're saying now.
- So-so what do we do?

349
00:19:12,429 --> 00:19:15,260
I'll tell you exactly
what we're gonna do.

350
00:19:16,839 --> 00:19:20,124
Uh, hi.
- Hey, hey.
Uh, Mr.... Cheadle--

351
00:19:20,124 --> 00:19:22,673
Uh, Donovan McNabb...
T-Tiger Woods,

352
00:19:22,673 --> 00:19:24,214
Elvin--
whatev-whatever your name is.

353
00:19:24,214 --> 00:19:27,072
Um, listen,
we have, uh, we have come
to the conclusion

354
00:19:27,072 --> 00:19:30,693
that, um,
you and only you
have the knowledge,

355
00:19:30,693 --> 00:19:34,657
the experience and the-the
authenticity to tell this story.

356
00:19:34,657 --> 00:19:37,956
So, we are gonna do the right
thing. We're gonna, we're gonna
do the woke thing,

357
00:19:37,956 --> 00:19:43,277
and hand complete
creative control
over to you...

358
00:19:48,208 --> 00:19:50,376
I feel like you were
gonna say something else?

359
00:19:50,376 --> 00:19:52,851
- Well...
- I think he was waiting
for the applause.

360
00:19:52,851 --> 00:19:54,319
Well...

361
00:19:54,319 --> 00:19:56,721
Oh. Okay? Uh...

362
00:19:56,721 --> 00:19:59,706
- Oh, yeah! Yay!
- Sure, sure.
If you must.

363
00:19:59,706 --> 00:20:02,549
It's nice when it happens,
isn't it?

364
00:20:02,592 --> 00:20:04,166
- Feels nice.
- Sure. Nice when
it happens naturally.
When it happens naturally,
I like it.

365
00:20:04,166 --> 00:20:08,405
Yeah, um, listen, the point is,
we want you to know
that we are allies.

366
00:20:08,405 --> 00:20:09,395
Great.

367
00:20:09,395 --> 00:20:13,755
- Okay?
- We are allies.
We are your allies.
- Up top.
- Allies!

368
00:20:13,755 --> 00:20:15,458
- We're on your side.

369
00:20:15,458 --> 00:20:17,631
But were they?

370
00:20:17,631 --> 00:20:22,608
Lethal Weapon 7 was destined
to be an inferno
of quasi-wokeness and, uh,

371
00:20:22,608 --> 00:20:24,740
good old-fashioned racism.

372
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:30,169
Out of the, uh,
smoldering ashes, however,
I pieced together
a cautionary tale.

373
00:20:30,169 --> 00:20:34,466
An exploration, not of what
is gained by learning,

374
00:20:34,466 --> 00:20:39,195
but of what is lost
by staying ignorant.

375
00:20:40,015 --> 00:20:42,522
WHITE SAVIORS

376
00:20:42,523 --> 00:20:44,657
DIRECTED

377
00:20:48,388 --> 00:20:50,846
Thank you.
Thank you so much. Wow.

378
00:20:50,846 --> 00:20:53,600
Oh, my God.
This is so humiliating.

379
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:57,913
Where does he get off
telling our story
without even
including us at all?

380
00:20:57,913 --> 00:20:59,342
And he made us look
like assholes.

381
00:20:59,342 --> 00:21:01,346
- I feel used.
- I feel misunderstood.

382
00:21:01,346 --> 00:21:03,093
What does he know
about our experience?

383
00:21:03,093 --> 00:21:05,346
Yeah. I'll tell you, there's
only one thing left to do.

384
00:21:05,346 --> 00:21:07,458
Make Lethal Weapon 8?
- Yup.

385
00:21:09,944 --> 00:21:12,365
- I'll play Murtaugh.
- Goddamn it, Mac.
- I-I'll play Murtaugh.
- No! No, no, no, no.

386
00:21:12,365 --> 00:21:14,935
- Did you not watch the...
- I'll do it good.

387
00:21:14,935 --> 00:21:15,936
translate
