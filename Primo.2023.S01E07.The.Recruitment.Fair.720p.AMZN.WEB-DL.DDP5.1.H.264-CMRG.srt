1
00:00:01,736 --> 00:00:03,279
{\an8}I can't believe
I didn't know this about you.

2
00:00:03,362 --> 00:00:04,780
{\an8}- Nobody does.
- I mean,

3
00:00:04,864 --> 00:00:06,542
{\an8}I knew you liked to read romance novels,

4
00:00:06,542 --> 00:00:09,368
but I had no idea you wanted to write one.

5
00:00:09,368 --> 00:00:10,828
I actually started already.

6
00:00:10,911 --> 00:00:12,163
You did?

7
00:00:12,246 --> 00:00:16,292
I did. Yeah.
I even, um, I came up with my pen name.

8
00:00:16,375 --> 00:00:18,961
Ruby Sapphire Pearl.

9
00:00:19,045 --> 00:00:22,048
- Oh, girl, you sound so expensive.
- Yeah.

10
00:00:22,131 --> 00:00:23,257
Check it out.

11
00:00:27,303 --> 00:00:30,389
Wait. Is that Usher?
No.

12
00:00:30,473 --> 00:00:32,391
- Wait. Is that you?
- No. That's just another woman.

13
00:00:32,475 --> 00:00:34,393
Just some regular woman. It's not me.

14
00:00:35,394 --> 00:00:37,021
Girl, that's the store we're in.

15
00:00:37,104 --> 00:00:38,939
- No, it's not.
- Okay.

16
00:00:39,023 --> 00:00:40,483
Then what's the book about?

17
00:00:40,566 --> 00:00:43,152
A famous R&B singer
stops in at a convenience store

18
00:00:43,235 --> 00:00:46,030
after a concert in town and
he falls in love with the store manager.

19
00:00:46,113 --> 00:00:47,073
Uh-hmm.

20
00:00:47,156 --> 00:00:49,200
What? It's not Usher and it's not me.

21
00:00:49,283 --> 00:00:52,078
Okay. All right.
So what's the book called?

22
00:00:52,161 --> 00:00:54,163
I have a few different options.

23
00:00:54,246 --> 00:00:55,790
- Like what?
- All right.

24
00:00:55,873 --> 00:00:56,999
Maybe something like,

25
00:00:58,626 --> 00:01:01,003
- "His body was weary from the road.
-  Uh-hmm.

26
00:01:01,087 --> 00:01:03,589
- Her body was weary from the world."
- Yeah.

27
00:01:03,673 --> 00:01:06,175
- They both needed something.
- What'd they need?

28
00:01:06,258 --> 00:01:09,929
- "Night Pump."
- Oh, that's good.
- That's good.
- Yeah?

29
00:01:10,012 --> 00:01:12,807
"The store wasn't
the only thing open 24 hours."

30
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:16,060
-  Oh.
- "A Pump of Convenience."

31
00:01:16,143 --> 00:01:17,895
Oh, keep going. Come on.

32
00:01:17,978 --> 00:01:20,731
"A mysterious stranger in need of gas,

33
00:01:20,815 --> 00:01:24,985
an enticed store manager
in need of so much more."

34
00:01:25,069 --> 00:01:27,154
"Pump Her Up."

35
00:01:27,238 --> 00:01:29,031
Damn. Usher's doing a lot of pumping.

36
00:01:29,115 --> 00:01:31,200
It's not Usher, Esther!

37
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:38,791
Fair

38
00:01:38,791 --> 00:01:41,419
I was thinking of checking out
the school play next week.

39
00:01:41,502 --> 00:01:43,754
They're doing a stage adaptation
of  Training Day,

40
00:01:43,838 --> 00:01:45,715
but instead of cops,
it's gonna be teachers.

41
00:01:45,798 --> 00:01:48,884
They're calling it  Explaining Day.
Are you gonna go?

42
00:01:48,968 --> 00:01:52,012
I was really looking forward to it,
but my parents won't let me go.

43
00:01:52,096 --> 00:01:54,557
They heard the theatre kids
got busted for butt-chugging.

44
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,727
Oh, bummer.
Wait, what's butt-chugging?

45
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:00,020
It's exactly
what you think it is.

46
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:03,649
What happened to good
old-fashioned heroin? You know?

47
00:02:04,066 --> 00:02:06,986
Or when people smoked crack
in the parking lot after school.

48
00:02:07,069 --> 00:02:08,904
You know, those are the days that I miss.

49
00:02:08,988 --> 00:02:10,406
-   Who's that on the phone

50
00:02:10,489 --> 00:02:12,867
Hey, Dad.
It's Rafa.

51
00:02:13,784 --> 00:02:15,494
- Don't say my name.
-   Rafa,

52
00:02:15,578 --> 00:02:17,121
the kid who kept you out late?

53
00:02:17,204 --> 00:02:18,581
At the carnival? Yeah.

54
00:02:18,664 --> 00:02:20,416
Please stop giving him details.

55
00:02:20,499 --> 00:02:23,335
What is she supposed to do,
young man, lie to me?

56
00:02:31,844 --> 00:02:33,554
May I hang up, sir?

57
00:02:34,513 --> 00:02:36,432
Were you one of the butt-chuggers?

58
00:02:38,142 --> 00:02:40,352
- Drink with your mouth, son.

59
00:02:45,149 --> 00:02:46,650
Rafa, did you hang up?

60
00:02:48,277 --> 00:02:49,361
He hung up.

61
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:54,799
It's over. Mr. Perkins is never gonna
let Mya hang out with us

62
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,485
if he thinks I smoke crack.

63
00:02:57,411 --> 00:02:58,621
Which I don't.

64
00:02:58,704 --> 00:02:59,955
No one thinks you smoke crack, man.

65
00:03:00,039 --> 00:03:01,624
You got a stomachache
from a gummy vitamin.

66
00:03:01,707 --> 00:03:03,709
Is Mya's dad the Army guy
with all the guns?

67
00:03:03,793 --> 00:03:05,588
Mm, no. He's Air Force. They got drones.

68
00:03:05,588 --> 00:03:08,339
He could probably kill Rafa
with a missile he controls from his phone.

69
00:03:08,422 --> 00:03:10,841
Great. Now, I have to worry
about airborne strikes too.

70
00:03:10,925 --> 00:03:15,599
Dude, relax. You're in a great spot.
You are the bad boy now.

71
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,431
- I didn't do anything bad.
- So?

72
00:03:17,431 --> 00:03:20,226
Forbidden love, that's the key
to all great love stories.

73
00:03:20,309 --> 00:03:22,394
Romeo and Juliet,  dad hated him.

74
00:03:22,478 --> 00:03:25,564
Gnomeo and Juliet,  dad hated him.

75
00:03:25,648 --> 00:03:27,817
He's right.
Your next move, actually do drugs.

76
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:29,390
Or at least show up to school drunk.

77
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:30,945
Take advantage of the situation.

78
00:03:31,028 --> 00:03:34,365
Then her dad will never let her see you
and you will be golden, my guy.

79
00:03:34,448 --> 00:03:36,367
He definitely already hates me.

80
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:40,246
Mya sent me phone emoji,
circle slash emoji, skull emoji,

81
00:03:40,329 --> 00:03:41,722
and then a screenshot of her contacts

82
00:03:41,722 --> 00:03:43,541
where she changed my number
to "Scam Likely."

83
00:03:43,624 --> 00:03:45,543
Yeah, you're toast. Good as droned.

84
00:03:45,626 --> 00:03:47,378
Maybe I should switch schools.

85
00:03:47,461 --> 00:03:49,880
Or I could drop out
and move into the woods.

86
00:03:49,964 --> 00:03:53,259
Or... you kill Mister Perkins first.

87
00:03:53,342 --> 00:03:56,512
A preemptive strike.
Then you'll be the ultimate bad boy.

88
00:03:56,595 --> 00:03:59,515
I'm not gonna blow up Mister Perkins,
Miguel.

89
00:04:00,432 --> 00:04:02,518
I'm so tired of hanging out
with you losers.

90
00:04:03,561 --> 00:04:04,599
Where's Jay?

91
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:07,189
I need help unloading my sculptures
and he's the only one mature enough

92
00:04:07,273 --> 00:04:08,691
not to comment on their erotic nature.

93
00:04:08,774 --> 00:04:11,944
They're all wangs.
You expect us not to comment on that?

94
00:04:12,027 --> 00:04:14,655
He's out of town on a job.
He'll be back tomorrow.

95
00:04:14,738 --> 00:04:17,783
I'd offer to help,
but I've got a big day today.

96
00:04:18,409 --> 00:04:21,078
Completely unreachable until 4:00.

97
00:04:22,329 --> 00:04:23,747
Anybody wanna ask me why?

98
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:28,043
All right. Well, ... my life then, huh?

99
00:04:31,505 --> 00:04:34,300
- Mike.
-  Hmm.
- Come help me at the flea market.
-  I can't.

100
00:04:34,383 --> 00:04:37,636
There's a job fair at Primo's school.
I'm working the Army Recruitment booth.

101
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,930
Also, I do not wanna touch your penis art.

102
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:41,682
It's not just "penis art."

103
00:04:41,765 --> 00:04:44,001
It's an artistic exploration
attempting to demystify

104
00:04:44,001 --> 00:04:45,436
the phallus in our culture.

105
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:46,896
They've got veins.

106
00:04:46,979 --> 00:04:49,440
Rollie?
Hey, no, can do.

107
00:04:49,523 --> 00:04:52,484
I hooked up with the flea market mascot
who turned out to have crabs.

108
00:04:52,568 --> 00:04:55,154
They're crazy, right? A flea with crabs?

109
00:04:55,237 --> 00:04:58,032
Hey, life's a highway, man.

110
00:04:58,115 --> 00:05:00,117
They hired a new lady
to wear the flea costume.

111
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,036
- Come on.
- All right. I'm in.

112
00:05:02,119 --> 00:05:03,880
Can't get crabs twice.

113
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:09,710
Uh, Rafa, what are your plans today?

114
00:05:09,793 --> 00:05:11,760
Before you answer that,
have you considered

115
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:14,381
working the job in recruitment fair
with your cool Uncle Mike?

116
00:05:14,465 --> 00:05:15,966
Not once have I considered that.

117
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:19,094
Come on. Help me out.
Competition this year is gonna be tough.

118
00:05:19,178 --> 00:05:21,639
The Navy guys,
they're using the swimming pool

119
00:05:21,639 --> 00:05:23,182
for Seal Team demonstrations.

120
00:05:23,182 --> 00:05:26,560
Mya's dad is doing the Air Force booth.
He brought a flight simulator.

121
00:05:26,644 --> 00:05:27,686
Mya's dad is gonna be there?

122
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:29,438
Yeah. A lot of people's dads
are gonna be there.

123
00:05:30,439 --> 00:05:32,900
Well, if you really
need my help, then yeah, sure.

124
00:05:32,983 --> 00:05:34,068
- Really?
-  Yeah.

125
00:05:34,151 --> 00:05:35,903
Okay. Cool. Yeah.

126
00:05:35,986 --> 00:05:38,489
You're finally gonna get
to see me do what I do.

127
00:05:38,572 --> 00:05:40,115
We have an obstacle course.

128
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:44,119
If a kid makes it all the way through,
boom, camouflage keychains.

129
00:05:44,203 --> 00:05:46,163
Why would you wanna
make keys harder to find?

130
00:05:47,414 --> 00:05:50,250
See? You're already
a valuable member of the team.

131
00:05:50,334 --> 00:05:52,670
We're gonna go with the stress balls.

132
00:05:52,753 --> 00:05:55,506
Let's go. You carry that.

133
00:05:57,257 --> 00:05:58,300
- Have fun.
-  Bye.

134
00:05:58,384 --> 00:05:59,677
Okay. Love you.

135
00:06:00,844 --> 00:06:02,137
-  Bye.
- Bye.

136
00:06:04,306 --> 00:06:05,516
After you.

137
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:14,650
Gone, gone, out, gone, gone, gone.

138
00:06:15,901 --> 00:06:18,570
Oh, my God. They're all gone.

139
00:06:19,488 --> 00:06:21,782
Eight hours of nothing.

140
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:35,504
How's this? I arranged them all by size.

141
00:06:36,797 --> 00:06:39,174
I like it. It's like an erotic staircase.

142
00:06:43,303 --> 00:06:46,132
Morning, Mondo. Great day for leather.

143
00:06:46,132 --> 00:06:49,126
Real leather weather.

144
00:06:49,443 --> 00:06:50,936
Leave me alone, Gary.

145
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:53,856
You must be one of Mondo's many brothers.

146
00:06:53,939 --> 00:06:57,985
I'm Gary Morales.
But you can call me Leatherman.

147
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:01,405
Is this a leather business card?

148
00:07:01,488 --> 00:07:02,698
It sure is, peanut.

149
00:07:02,781 --> 00:07:04,908
And I only made one, so I need it back.

150
00:07:04,992 --> 00:07:07,494
Take a good look. Memorize it.

151
00:07:07,578 --> 00:07:10,664
- "Leatherman at Leatherman.biz."
- That's right.

152
00:07:11,749 --> 00:07:15,753
New drop today,  muchachos.
Business will be brisk.

153
00:07:15,836 --> 00:07:17,921
You don't mind if I take this, do you?

154
00:07:20,924 --> 00:07:22,551
Sorry about your dicks.

155
00:07:24,636 --> 00:07:26,597
- Hey, I'll be right back.
- Where are you going?

156
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,390
I'm gonna go cave this guy's head in.

157
00:07:28,474 --> 00:07:30,851
And I gotta do it quick,
so it doesn't become "premeditated."

158
00:07:30,934 --> 00:07:32,978
Rollie, violence is never right.

159
00:07:33,062 --> 00:07:34,855
Hey, what's the deal with this guy?

160
00:07:34,855 --> 00:07:36,607
It's a long story.
And I don't wanna get into it.

161
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:38,734
We can just display
the sculptures on the blanket.

162
00:07:38,817 --> 00:07:40,110
It'll look more natural,

163
00:07:40,194 --> 00:07:42,571
like the penises
are growing out of the earth.

164
00:08:03,634 --> 00:08:05,803
Okay. So you're being extra weird today.

165
00:08:05,886 --> 00:08:08,514
No, I'm not. My dream girl
is coming into the bank today.

166
00:08:08,597 --> 00:08:09,932
Priscilla Diaz.

167
00:08:10,015 --> 00:08:13,018
I've been handling her accounts
for three months now and I'm telling you,

168
00:08:13,102 --> 00:08:15,562
she is the one.
Today, we finally meet.

169
00:08:15,646 --> 00:08:17,606
She's "the one," and you've never met her?

170
00:08:17,689 --> 00:08:19,650
That's right.
I know everything I need to know.

171
00:08:19,733 --> 00:08:21,299
She has a fully funded Roth IRA.

172
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,445
She moved her money
from fixed income and into equities

173
00:08:23,529 --> 00:08:26,073
to perfectly take advantage
of the bull market of 2021.

174
00:08:26,156 --> 00:08:27,825
So yeah, she's got it all.

175
00:08:27,908 --> 00:08:29,535
Why don't you just
be normal and date someone

176
00:08:29,618 --> 00:08:32,246
who you've actually
seen before like Claudia?

177
00:08:32,329 --> 00:08:35,666
Claudia? She collects Beanie Babies.

178
00:08:35,749 --> 00:08:37,000
Those are endangered animals.

179
00:08:37,084 --> 00:08:39,711
And she only gets those
because she donates to a wildlife charity.

180
00:08:39,795 --> 00:08:42,089
Oh, so she just gives her money away?
Uh, real smart.

181
00:08:42,172 --> 00:08:46,760
Priscilla Diaz would never do that.
Plus, she's only an account manager.

182
00:08:46,844 --> 00:08:48,512
- You're an account manager.
- Exactly.

183
00:08:48,595 --> 00:08:51,598
You date for the job you want,
not the job you have.

184
00:08:51,682 --> 00:08:55,185
The key to a successful
recruitment fair is determination.

185
00:08:55,269 --> 00:08:56,854
And discipline.

186
00:08:56,937 --> 00:08:58,105
And dedication.

187
00:08:58,730 --> 00:08:59,815
And bouncy castles.

188
00:08:59,898 --> 00:09:01,358
That's a lot of keys.

189
00:09:01,441 --> 00:09:03,777
Maybe we should've
brought those keychains after all.

190
00:09:05,487 --> 00:09:08,490
Hi, Mr. Perkins. Sir.

191
00:09:08,574 --> 00:09:12,619
San Antonio's very own Nino Brown.
How's the crack cocaine business?

192
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:15,831
Oh. Ha. Very funny joke.

193
00:09:15,914 --> 00:09:19,501
But I would never sell
crack cocaine or smoke it.

194
00:09:19,585 --> 00:09:23,755
I, I don't even crack jokes, or eggs,
or anything else that you can crack,

195
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:25,465
especially cocaine.

196
00:09:26,466 --> 00:09:27,718
Are you high right now?

197
00:09:29,344 --> 00:09:32,472
Another good one.
Wow. You're on a roll today, sir.

198
00:09:32,556 --> 00:09:36,268
No, of course, I'm not high.
High on patriotism, maybe.

199
00:09:36,351 --> 00:09:39,813
Other than that, completely sober.
Do you have a breathalyzer?

200
00:09:39,897 --> 00:09:43,192
Or a cup. Uh, you know, for pee?

201
00:09:43,275 --> 00:09:46,653
I, I'd be... I'd be so happy
to give you some of my urine, sir.

202
00:09:46,737 --> 00:09:49,239
It would be an absolute honor
and a privilege.

203
00:09:49,239 --> 00:09:50,324
Just one without pens.

204
00:09:50,407 --> 00:09:51,992
I don't want your urine, Rafael.

205
00:09:52,951 --> 00:09:54,036
Right.

206
00:09:54,119 --> 00:09:57,748
Hey, bud.
I know what's going on here.

207
00:09:57,831 --> 00:09:59,082
You do?

208
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:01,835
I know you're scared.

209
00:10:01,919 --> 00:10:04,296
But this obstacle course
is completely safe.

210
00:10:04,379 --> 00:10:06,256
Why don't you give it
a practice run before we start?

211
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:08,091
- Come on. I'll time you.
-  I don't really...

212
00:10:08,175 --> 00:10:09,676
-  Ready?
-  Watch out.

213
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:10,969
Crawl and weave!

214
00:10:11,053 --> 00:10:13,555
Crawl and weave, Primo. Crawl and weave!

215
00:10:13,639 --> 00:10:15,807
Let's go! Let's go! Come on. Jump!

216
00:10:17,476 --> 00:10:20,646
Sniper got you.
You're dead. Start over.

217
00:10:26,026 --> 00:10:28,403
All right. Shoes off.
I'll be back to time you.

218
00:10:29,905 --> 00:10:32,074
Remember, there's a lot
of jobs in the Army,

219
00:10:32,157 --> 00:10:34,159
it's not just combat.
That's important to tell these kids.

220
00:10:34,243 --> 00:10:35,786
- Uh-huh.
- And a good thing about having you here

221
00:10:35,869 --> 00:10:38,664
is everyone will know right away clearly
you do not have to fight.

222
00:10:38,747 --> 00:10:40,749
- Absolutely.
- This is fun, huh?

223
00:10:40,832 --> 00:10:42,501
You and me, quality time?

224
00:10:42,584 --> 00:10:45,003
Primo, let me run something by you.

225
00:10:45,003 --> 00:10:46,622
Why do you think
I don't have a girlfriend?

226
00:10:46,622 --> 00:10:49,508
I mean, I got the prescription deodorant,
so it's not that anymore.

227
00:10:49,591 --> 00:10:50,634
Yeah, totally.

228
00:10:55,789 --> 00:10:58,767
Hello there. I'm Ryan,
Senior Executive Account Manager.

229
00:10:58,850 --> 00:11:00,978
It would be my honor to assist you

230
00:11:01,061 --> 00:11:04,481
with all your needs today,
Ms. Lisa Guzman?

231
00:11:04,564 --> 00:11:07,484
Ugh. Paul can help you.

232
00:11:07,567 --> 00:11:09,778
Paul? This chick needs something.

233
00:11:14,283 --> 00:11:16,827
Hey, do you want me to take over
greeting the customers?

234
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:19,121
'Cause you're being such a jackass today.

235
00:11:19,204 --> 00:11:21,456
I'm sorry. I'm fine. I got it. Yeah.

236
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:24,084
Oh, also apparently
the outdoor ATM is down.

237
00:11:24,167 --> 00:11:26,878
Yes. There's a McDonald's pancake
in the deposit slot.

238
00:11:26,962 --> 00:11:28,380
What?

239
00:11:28,463 --> 00:11:29,965
I'm sorry, I should be more clear.

240
00:11:30,048 --> 00:11:32,301
I stuffed a McDonald's pancake
in there so that it would break.

241
00:11:32,301 --> 00:11:33,844
So then everybody would have to come in,

242
00:11:33,927 --> 00:11:36,221
and then I can finally meet
the woman that I'm in love with.

243
00:11:36,305 --> 00:11:39,891
Oh. Today is the day you meet
"Investment account ending in 6421?"

244
00:11:39,975 --> 00:11:43,812
Yup. Claudia, let me ask you a question.
Imagine that you work at a bank.

245
00:11:43,812 --> 00:11:46,064
- I do work in a bank.
- Great. Stay with that.

246
00:11:46,148 --> 00:11:48,233
Now, imagine that you're trying
to impress a client

247
00:11:48,317 --> 00:11:50,777
whose account information
you are very familiar with.

248
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,198
Which of these ties would you choose?

249
00:11:57,075 --> 00:11:58,785
I think you look good in both.

250
00:12:00,495 --> 00:12:04,583
Well, great. That's not helpful.
Thanks for nothing, Anna Wintour.

251
00:12:27,814 --> 00:12:32,694
What is...
He's never even seen the sunlight, it's...

252
00:12:38,283 --> 00:12:43,121
She led him to the stockroom,
where he revealed his inventory.

253
00:12:45,916 --> 00:12:49,503
Oh, his, his rising inventory.

254
00:12:49,586 --> 00:12:52,672
Oh, that's good. Rising.

255
00:12:52,756 --> 00:12:55,217
That's so good, Esther. Yeah.

256
00:13:05,936 --> 00:13:08,105
The baby has amnesia?

257
00:13:09,523 --> 00:13:11,483
Oh, my God.

258
00:13:26,039 --> 00:13:30,585
Leather underwear. Leather visor.
Ma'am?

259
00:13:30,669 --> 00:13:35,173
Leather onesie for the little one?
It's treated. The poop slides right off.

260
00:13:35,257 --> 00:13:36,299
No, thanks.

261
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:40,262
No? Your baby's ugly anyway.

262
00:13:46,309 --> 00:13:49,271
Hey! You got mud on our blanket!

263
00:13:49,354 --> 00:13:52,441
You should've put your stuff on a table.

264
00:13:52,524 --> 00:13:54,484
Rollie, don't.

265
00:13:54,568 --> 00:13:56,862
Hey, you gotta tell me
what's up with this guy.

266
00:13:57,654 --> 00:14:00,699
Believe it or not,
Leatherman used to be my best friend.

267
00:14:00,782 --> 00:14:02,534
Back then, he was just "Gary."

268
00:14:05,203 --> 00:14:07,414
It was the end
of strawberry season.

269
00:14:07,497 --> 00:14:09,916
After the harvest,
we both had money to spend.

270
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,335
I have a business proposition for you.

271
00:14:12,419 --> 00:14:16,715
There's a cattle auction coming to town.
What if you and I went in half on a cow?

272
00:14:18,258 --> 00:14:21,386
I was thrilled.
It was like having a thousand-pound dog.

273
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:23,889
That cow and I,
we had a spiritual connection.

274
00:14:23,972 --> 00:14:26,391
Like we had been friends in a past life.

275
00:14:27,184 --> 00:14:29,102
Good girl!

276
00:14:29,186 --> 00:14:30,979
I thought he loved her as much as I did.

277
00:14:31,062 --> 00:14:34,983
But soon I discovered
that he had very different intentions.

278
00:14:35,066 --> 00:14:38,236
Everything went great!
We should at least double our money.

279
00:14:39,613 --> 00:14:41,573
How could you do this?

280
00:14:41,656 --> 00:14:46,745
I lost two friends that day.
The cow died and Gary did, too.

281
00:14:47,829 --> 00:14:49,706
Leatherman was born in his place.

282
00:14:49,789 --> 00:14:54,461
Yo, I remember Gary now.
From years ago. Yeah, that guy's a dick.

283
00:14:54,544 --> 00:14:56,922
Hey, you're carving them for a living,

284
00:14:57,005 --> 00:14:59,591
but can't see when there's
a human one right in front of you?

285
00:14:59,674 --> 00:15:02,135
You know
what the difference between us is?

286
00:15:02,219 --> 00:15:06,056
That I choose peace.
That's why I've never been to jail.

287
00:15:07,974 --> 00:15:12,521
Except for that time that I did ayahuasca
and went into the IHOP without pants.

288
00:15:12,604 --> 00:15:16,525
Hey, look, you don't want me to fight him?
I won't fight him.

289
00:15:16,608 --> 00:15:18,944
But you gotta stand up for yourself.

290
00:15:19,027 --> 00:15:23,281
If not for you, then do it for...
uh, what was your dog cow's name?

291
00:15:23,365 --> 00:15:24,533
Moo-chelle Pfeiffer.

292
00:15:24,616 --> 00:15:26,284
Yeah, Moo-chelle.

293
00:15:26,368 --> 00:15:28,119
You're under enemy fire.

294
00:15:28,203 --> 00:15:32,374
Your platoon is the last hope
to get this nuclear warhead to safety.

295
00:15:32,457 --> 00:15:35,961
The fate of the United States
of America is in your hands.

296
00:15:36,044 --> 00:15:37,462
Godspeed.

297
00:15:42,801 --> 00:15:45,554
Juan! Too slow! You're dead.
Pass the nuke to Carla.

298
00:15:45,637 --> 00:15:47,430
- Hey, are you timing this?
- Yeah, sorry.

299
00:15:47,514 --> 00:15:51,309
Uh, Carla's got 20 seconds left
before that bomb destroys San Antonio.

300
00:15:51,393 --> 00:15:53,270
Excuse me just one sec.

301
00:15:53,353 --> 00:15:56,439
Leave him behind, Carla!
It's too late for him!

302
00:15:56,523 --> 00:15:57,649
Keep going!

303
00:15:58,358 --> 00:16:04,030
Ah, the old, uh, F-15 Strike Eagle.

304
00:16:04,114 --> 00:16:06,241
- Yeah.
- Nice.

305
00:16:08,743 --> 00:16:10,453
Mind if I give her a whirl?

306
00:16:12,956 --> 00:16:15,792
Well, the Olive Garden recruiter
brought out the free breadsticks

307
00:16:15,875 --> 00:16:20,213
and everyone ran over there,
so, sure. Go crazy.

308
00:16:20,297 --> 00:16:23,091
- Okay.
- Let's get you set up here.

309
00:16:29,431 --> 00:16:31,099
I think I see.

310
00:16:31,182 --> 00:16:33,560
Yeah. Check her out.

311
00:16:44,404 --> 00:16:46,781
Direct hit. Not bad.

312
00:16:50,994 --> 00:16:52,120
Thank you, sir.

313
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:54,456
- Enjoy that leather toilet seat cover.
- I will.

314
00:16:54,539 --> 00:16:59,252
Man, I'm crushing carcass today.
How's the wooden dick business?

315
00:16:59,336 --> 00:17:02,047
Ironically, it looks like a soft market.

316
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:06,509
Hey, take your revenge.
Do it for Moo-chelle.

317
00:17:06,593 --> 00:17:10,055
Oh, is that what you're thinking about?

318
00:17:10,138 --> 00:17:13,850
Your old cow friend?
That is hilarious.

319
00:17:13,933 --> 00:17:18,146
She was my first murdered cow.
I still wear her sometimes, Mondo.

320
00:17:19,272 --> 00:17:23,193
She tanned up good. Real good.

321
00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:31,660
No! My leather goods!

322
00:17:44,631 --> 00:17:47,509
Look me in the eyes, Gary.
Look me in the eye...

323
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,723
This revenge had a lot more urine
than I was anticipating.

324
00:17:53,807 --> 00:17:55,433
How much is it usually?

325
00:17:55,517 --> 00:17:58,395
Zero.
Uh-hmm.

326
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:06,861
Nice job.
One of the best scores I've seen all day.

327
00:18:07,862 --> 00:18:08,863
Thank you.

328
00:18:10,532 --> 00:18:12,242
I appreciate you letting me test her out.

329
00:18:12,325 --> 00:18:13,576
What are you doing?

330
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:15,620
Destroying tanks
with heat-seeking missiles.

331
00:18:15,704 --> 00:18:18,915
Wack. You're supposed to be
helping me at the Army booth.

332
00:18:18,998 --> 00:18:20,959
I was counting on you and you let me down.

333
00:18:21,042 --> 00:18:22,585
Seems like you let each other down.

334
00:18:22,669 --> 00:18:25,338
Oh, no.
Evacuate the obstacle course!

335
00:18:25,422 --> 00:18:26,631
You are in danger!

336
00:18:26,715 --> 00:18:29,217
The structural integrity
has been compromised!

337
00:18:31,511 --> 00:18:33,012
- Army.
-  Evacuate now!

338
00:18:33,096 --> 00:18:36,349
He'll be fine.
He's very good at evacuations.

339
00:18:37,642 --> 00:18:40,437
He doesn't give a crap
about helping me recruit kids

340
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:42,856
into the armed forces.
It's basically treason!

341
00:18:42,939 --> 00:18:45,442
- What?
-   He lied to me, Drea!

342
00:18:45,525 --> 00:18:48,778
- Yeah.
-   And I know you think
I get defensive about defending America,

343
00:18:48,778 --> 00:18:51,350
- but defending America...
- No, no, I think you're great,
uh, in America.

344
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:52,741
...is literally my job.

345
00:18:52,824 --> 00:18:55,535
I have dedicated my life
to making us all safe.

346
00:18:55,618 --> 00:19:00,498
And the first rule of boot camp, Drea,
is that you respect your uncle.

347
00:19:00,582 --> 00:19:03,626
That is why they call him Uncle Sam, Drea.

348
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:06,463
Family is important.
That's what I'm saying!

349
00:19:06,546 --> 00:19:09,007
Well, I'm sure
you and Ryan will work it out, okay?

350
00:19:09,090 --> 00:19:10,258
Talk soon.

351
00:19:14,012 --> 00:19:16,431
Drea? Ryan's...

352
00:19:16,514 --> 00:19:18,600
I'm not with Ryan!

353
00:19:19,601 --> 00:19:21,561
God.

354
00:19:21,644 --> 00:19:25,231
Just leave it alone. I'll do it myself.
Just like I did all day.

355
00:19:29,152 --> 00:19:31,613
Uncle Mike, uh, that's my bad, okay?

356
00:19:31,696 --> 00:19:35,992
Apologies not accepted.
We were supposed to be working in tandem,

357
00:19:36,075 --> 00:19:39,579
to recruit soldiers and improve
the strength and might of the US military.

358
00:19:39,662 --> 00:19:40,997
And...

359
00:19:42,582 --> 00:19:44,709
- you hurt my feelings.
- I know.

360
00:19:44,793 --> 00:19:47,545
It's just, Mya's dad kinda hates me,

361
00:19:47,629 --> 00:19:51,466
and he's not gonna let Mya
hang out with me if he hates me.

362
00:19:51,549 --> 00:19:53,259
So I thought I could,

363
00:19:54,010 --> 00:19:58,223
I don't know, just spend some time
with him, try to get him on my side.

364
00:19:58,306 --> 00:20:00,934
Well, whatever. You shouldn't have lied.

365
00:20:01,017 --> 00:20:04,562
And your mom, I called her about it,
she completely agrees with me.

366
00:20:06,147 --> 00:20:09,234
Yeah.
Yeah. I know.

367
00:20:18,993 --> 00:20:22,207
Maybe she'll come next Saturday.
I guess.

368
00:20:22,207 --> 00:20:24,958
You want some charcuterie?
Sure.

369
00:20:25,041 --> 00:20:27,043
Nope. That ham is sweaty.

370
00:20:27,126 --> 00:20:30,421
Yeah, this ham is fully wet. Mm.

371
00:20:30,505 --> 00:20:33,383
Do not eat that.
Yeah.

372
00:20:33,466 --> 00:20:37,136
Hey, thanks for being so cool today.
I'm sorry if I was a little nutty.

373
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:38,388
It's okay.

374
00:20:38,471 --> 00:20:41,224
Or it's actually not "okay,"
because you're deeply weird,

375
00:20:41,307 --> 00:20:43,685
but it's enough "okay"
that I can tell you it's okay.

376
00:20:43,768 --> 00:20:45,937
Do you have any plans tonight?

377
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:48,898
Me and some friends
are going to a concert downtown.

378
00:20:48,982 --> 00:20:51,150
You into music?
Hmm.

379
00:20:51,234 --> 00:20:52,777
Come on, what's your favorite album?

380
00:20:52,861 --> 00:20:54,737
Oh, no. You're gonna think it's stupid.

381
00:20:54,821 --> 00:20:56,239
Probably.

382
00:20:57,490 --> 00:21:01,286
It's  Unleash the Champion Inside You,
by Bernie Snorkis.

383
00:21:01,369 --> 00:21:03,037
He's a motivational speaker.

384
00:21:03,121 --> 00:21:05,081
Yup, stupid.

385
00:21:05,164 --> 00:21:08,042
I know. It's just, I try
to focus on my career and my future,

386
00:21:08,126 --> 00:21:10,128
so I don't spend a lot
of time listening to music.

387
00:21:10,211 --> 00:21:13,506
I'm gonna make you a playlist.
You need normal, human interests.

388
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:14,674
Thanks.

389
00:21:14,757 --> 00:21:16,433
And I'll make you
a playlist of my favorite

390
00:21:16,433 --> 00:21:18,011
motivational speeches and TED Talks.

391
00:21:18,094 --> 00:21:20,638
- Please do not do that.
- Absolutely not, I won't.

392
00:21:23,525 --> 00:21:25,435
We'll release you,
but only once you've paid

393
00:21:25,518 --> 00:21:26,895
for the merchandise you destroyed.

394
00:21:26,978 --> 00:21:30,732
I can't. My only assets are 32 sculptures
and an antique pan flute.

395
00:21:30,815 --> 00:21:33,651
Then I want him banned
from the flea market for life,

396
00:21:33,735 --> 00:21:35,445
and extradited to Mexico.

397
00:21:35,528 --> 00:21:37,572
"Extradited?"
You know I'm not the government, right?

398
00:21:37,655 --> 00:21:39,115
This flea market
is the only way I have to make money.

399
00:21:39,198 --> 00:21:41,242
I am not going back
to selling these door to door.

400
00:21:41,326 --> 00:21:42,869
I got punched too many times.

401
00:21:43,728 --> 00:21:44,996
Hey, how about this, Gary.

402
00:21:45,079 --> 00:21:47,624
You screwed Mondo
out of half a cow back in the day.

403
00:21:47,707 --> 00:21:49,459
Hey, what do you say we call it even?

404
00:21:49,542 --> 00:21:52,003
That was two hundred bucks,  amigo.

405
00:21:52,086 --> 00:21:54,088
He ruined way more than that.

406
00:21:54,172 --> 00:21:55,590
You didn't let me finish.

407
00:21:55,673 --> 00:21:57,425
Hey, what do you say we call it even,

408
00:21:57,508 --> 00:21:59,302
or I follow you home
and cave your head in?

409
00:21:59,385 --> 00:22:01,599
That was a threat. Do something!

410
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,114
Again, I'm not the government.

411
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:05,433
Fine.

412
00:22:06,351 --> 00:22:07,769
Fine!

413
00:22:09,729 --> 00:22:12,315
I can't believe
how much anger I was holding in.

414
00:22:12,398 --> 00:22:15,610
I can't believe you flipped over a table.
Hey, we should hang out more often.

415
00:22:16,819 --> 00:22:20,114
Hey, I'm glad you stood up to that guy.
Some fights are worth fighting.

416
00:22:20,198 --> 00:22:22,867
I mean, to me,
all fights are worth fighting.

417
00:22:22,951 --> 00:22:24,994
But still, good for you.

418
00:22:27,038 --> 00:22:29,207
Hey, what are you doing? I peed on that.

419
00:22:29,290 --> 00:22:32,168
I'm gonna hose it down
and take it to the biker bar and sell it.

420
00:22:32,251 --> 00:22:33,962
There are so many foul smells
coming out of that place,

421
00:22:34,045 --> 00:22:36,839
- they won't even notice.
- I get a 50-50 split.

422
00:22:36,923 --> 00:22:40,301
Hey, look at you.
Standing up for yourself.

423
00:22:40,385 --> 00:22:43,012
But no, I'm keeping all the money.

424
00:22:43,930 --> 00:22:45,098
Okay.

425
00:22:52,271 --> 00:22:54,273
Hey. Good turnout?

426
00:22:54,357 --> 00:22:55,650
It was okay. How about you?

427
00:22:55,733 --> 00:22:59,153
Eh. A little worried about these kids,
I think they might be a bit soft.

428
00:22:59,237 --> 00:23:01,990
Definitely.
My whole presentation was a video game.

429
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:04,117
And a bunch of them asked me
if I worked for GameStop.

430
00:23:05,743 --> 00:23:06,869
I don't.

431
00:23:08,204 --> 00:23:13,042
Hey, listen, um,
I'm sorry if Primo was a little weird.

432
00:23:13,126 --> 00:23:15,837
He's under a lot of pressure
but he's a good kid.

433
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:17,630
He was raised to respect his elders,

434
00:23:17,714 --> 00:23:19,465
I think he was just trying
to make a good impression.

435
00:23:19,549 --> 00:23:20,633
Is that right?

436
00:23:21,759 --> 00:23:23,886
Maybe some of the things
Mya says about him are true.

437
00:23:23,970 --> 00:23:25,805
They are. Unless they were bad.

438
00:23:25,888 --> 00:23:28,641
In which case, your daughter is a liar.
Have a good night.

439
00:23:30,601 --> 00:23:33,104
I'm glad I did not go to that barbecue.

440
00:23:35,398 --> 00:23:36,816
Thanks for coming today.

441
00:23:36,899 --> 00:23:38,818
To be honest,
I didn't really need your help.

442
00:23:38,901 --> 00:23:41,279
You're actually pretty useless.
Militarily, I mean.

443
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:43,481
I just thought it might be cool
to hang with you a little.

444
00:23:44,824 --> 00:23:46,159
You hungry?

445
00:23:46,242 --> 00:23:48,036
Oh, my God, I'm starving.

446
00:23:48,119 --> 00:23:50,538
I was too scared to eat
in front of Mya's dad.

447
00:23:50,621 --> 00:23:53,374
I just felt like I was gonna get
something on my shirt, like always.

448
00:23:53,458 --> 00:23:55,126
We'll get burgers on the way home.

449
00:23:55,209 --> 00:23:58,921
By the way,
Mya talks to her dad about you.

450
00:23:59,005 --> 00:24:00,256
You talked to him?

451
00:24:00,339 --> 00:24:02,800
Military kids don't talk
to their dads about anything,

452
00:24:02,884 --> 00:24:06,721
so if she's talking about you,
that's a good sign.

453
00:24:06,804 --> 00:24:08,556
For real?

454
00:24:08,639 --> 00:24:10,975
That's kinda high-level intel you get

455
00:24:11,059 --> 00:24:12,977
when you hang out
with your cool Uncle Mike.

456
00:24:13,061 --> 00:24:14,562
He was there too?

457
00:24:14,645 --> 00:24:15,855
Get in the truck.

458
00:24:33,790 --> 00:24:35,750
Hey, Ma. We got burgers for everyone.

459
00:24:35,833 --> 00:24:39,420
We executed a search
and rescue today, Drea.

460
00:24:39,504 --> 00:24:40,880
- Whole team's beat.
- Oh yeah?

461
00:24:40,963 --> 00:24:43,049
- Yeah.
- Hey, sis, I need, ammonia,

462
00:24:43,132 --> 00:24:44,217
bleach, and a barrel.

463
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:45,927
That's going to create mustard gas.

464
00:24:45,927 --> 00:24:47,637
Yeah, but I gotta get the piss out
of these leather clothes

465
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,514
- I'm gonna sell to a biker gang.
- What?

466
00:24:49,597 --> 00:24:50,807
Thank you.

467
00:24:50,890 --> 00:24:52,767
Well, I may never find love.

468
00:24:54,227 --> 00:24:57,563
Play Bernie Snorkis motivational quotes.

469
00:24:57,647 --> 00:25:00,316
If you're poor,
it's your fault. Bernie Snorkis...

470
00:25:00,399 --> 00:25:01,901
Man, shut that off.

471
00:25:01,984 --> 00:25:04,445
I need water. I think I'm dehydrated.

472
00:25:04,529 --> 00:25:05,947
Oh, nice.

473
00:25:09,742 --> 00:25:11,410
I got ketchup on my shirt.

474
00:25:11,494 --> 00:25:14,080
You haven't even started eating.
Your burger is still wrapped!

475
00:25:14,163 --> 00:25:15,832
I told you. This is what happens.

476
00:25:16,958 --> 00:25:19,377
You're right, you did tell me.

477
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:20,962
- How'd y'all's day go?
-  Well, it was pretty good.

478
00:25:21,045 --> 00:25:24,132
-  Oh, man.
-  ...Moo-chelle Pfeiffer
and peed on a dead carcass...

479
00:25:24,215 --> 00:25:25,842
Yeah, there was the Leatherman guy.

480
00:25:25,925 --> 00:25:28,719
And he tried to fight me but I was like,
"No, you're not gonna be able
to fight me."

481
00:25:31,099 --> 00:25:32,792
Frowny

482
00:25:37,937 --> 00:25:40,857
I'm good. Really good.

483
00:25:49,699 --> 00:25:51,576
Is this is a leather onesie?

484
00:25:51,659 --> 00:25:53,327
It sure is, peanut.
