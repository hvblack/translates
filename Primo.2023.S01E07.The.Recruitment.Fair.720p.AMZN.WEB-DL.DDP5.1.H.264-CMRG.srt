1
00:00:01,836 --> 00:00:03,379
{\an8}I can't believe
I didn't know this about you.

2
00:00:03,462 --> 00:00:04,880
{\an8}- Nobody does.
- I mean,

3
00:00:04,964 --> 00:00:09,385
{\an8}I knew you liked to read romance novels,
but I had no idea you wanted to write one.

4
00:00:09,468 --> 00:00:10,928
I actually started already.

5
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:12,263
You did?

6
00:00:12,346 --> 00:00:16,392
I did. Yeah.
I even, um, I came up with my pen name.

7
00:00:16,475 --> 00:00:19,061
Ruby Sapphire Pearl.

8
00:00:19,145 --> 00:00:22,148
- Oh, girl, you sound so expensive.
- Yeah.

9
00:00:22,231 --> 00:00:23,357
Check it out.

10
00:00:27,403 --> 00:00:29,155
Wait. Is that Usher?

11
00:00:29,238 --> 00:00:30,489
No.

12
00:00:30,573 --> 00:00:32,491
- Wait. Is that you?
- No. That's just another woman.

13
00:00:32,575 --> 00:00:34,493
Just some regular woman. It's not me.

14
00:00:35,494 --> 00:00:37,121
Girl, that's the store we're in.

15
00:00:37,204 --> 00:00:39,039
- No, it's not.
- Okay.

16
00:00:39,123 --> 00:00:40,583
Then what's the book about?

17
00:00:40,666 --> 00:00:43,252
A famous R&B singer
stops in at a convenience store

18
00:00:43,335 --> 00:00:46,130
after a concert in town and
he falls in love with the store manager.

19
00:00:46,213 --> 00:00:47,173
Uh-hmm.

20
00:00:47,256 --> 00:00:49,300
What? It's not Usher and it's not me.

21
00:00:49,383 --> 00:00:52,178
Okay. All right.
So what's the book called?

22
00:00:52,261 --> 00:00:54,263
I have a few different options.

23
00:00:54,346 --> 00:00:55,890
- Like what?
- All right.

24
00:00:55,973 --> 00:00:57,099
Maybe something like,

25
00:00:58,726 --> 00:01:01,103
- "His body was weary from the road.
-  Uh-hmm.

26
00:01:01,187 --> 00:01:03,689
- Her body was weary from the world."
- Yeah.

27
00:01:03,773 --> 00:01:06,275
- They both needed something.
- What'd they need?

28
00:01:06,358 --> 00:01:08,903
- "Night Pump."
- Oh, that's good.

29
00:01:08,986 --> 00:01:10,029
- That's good.
- Yeah?

30
00:01:10,112 --> 00:01:12,907
"The store wasn't
the only thing open 24 hours."

31
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:16,160
-  Oh.
- "A Pump of Convenience."

32
00:01:16,243 --> 00:01:17,995
Oh, keep going. Come on.

33
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:20,831
"A mysterious stranger in need of gas,

34
00:01:20,915 --> 00:01:25,085
an enticed store manager
in need of so much more."

35
00:01:25,169 --> 00:01:27,254
"Pump Her Up."

36
00:01:27,338 --> 00:01:29,131
Damn. Usher's doing a lot of pumping.

37
00:01:29,215 --> 00:01:31,300
It's not Usher, Esther!

38
00:01:38,891 --> 00:01:41,519
I was thinking of checking out
the school play next week.

39
00:01:41,602 --> 00:01:43,854
They're doing a stage adaptation
of  Training Day,

40
00:01:43,938 --> 00:01:45,815
but instead of cops,
it's gonna be teachers.

41
00:01:45,898 --> 00:01:48,984
They're calling it  Explaining Day.
Are you gonna go?

42
00:01:49,068 --> 00:01:52,112
I was really looking forward to it,
but my parents won't let me go.

43
00:01:52,196 --> 00:01:54,657
They heard the theatre kids
got busted for butt-chugging.

44
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:57,827
Oh, bummer.
Wait, what's butt-chugging?

45
00:01:57,910 --> 00:02:00,120
It's exactly
what you think it is.

46
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:03,749
What happened to good
old-fashioned heroin? You know?

47
00:02:04,166 --> 00:02:07,086
Or when people smoked crack
in the parking lot after school.

48
00:02:07,169 --> 00:02:09,004
You know, those are the days that I miss.

49
00:02:09,088 --> 00:02:10,506
-   Who's that on the phone

50
00:02:10,589 --> 00:02:11,590
Hey, Dad.

51
00:02:11,674 --> 00:02:12,967
It's Rafa.

52
00:02:13,884 --> 00:02:15,594
- Don't say my name.
-   Rafa,

53
00:02:15,678 --> 00:02:17,221
the kid who kept you out late?

54
00:02:17,304 --> 00:02:18,681
At the carnival? Yeah.

55
00:02:18,764 --> 00:02:20,516
Please stop giving him details.

56
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:23,435
What is she supposed to do,
young man, lie to me?

57
00:02:31,944 --> 00:02:33,654
May I hang up, sir?

58
00:02:34,613 --> 00:02:36,532
Were you one of the butt-chuggers?

59
00:02:38,242 --> 00:02:40,452
- Drink with your mouth, son.

60
00:02:45,249 --> 00:02:46,750
Rafa, did you hang up?

61
00:02:48,377 --> 00:02:49,461
He hung up.

62
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:54,884
It's over. Mr. Perkins is never gonna
let Mya hang out with us

63
00:02:54,967 --> 00:02:56,385
if he thinks I smoke crack.

64
00:02:57,511 --> 00:02:58,721
Which I don't.

65
00:02:58,804 --> 00:03:00,055
No one thinks you smoke crack, man.

66
00:03:00,139 --> 00:03:01,724
You got a stomachache
from a gummy vitamin.

67
00:03:01,807 --> 00:03:03,809
Is Mya's dad the Army guy
with all the guns?

68
00:03:03,893 --> 00:03:05,644
Mm, no. He's Air Force. They got drones.

69
00:03:05,728 --> 00:03:08,439
He could probably kill Rafa
with a missile he controls from his phone.

70
00:03:08,522 --> 00:03:10,941
Great. Now, I have to worry
about airborne strikes too.

71
00:03:11,025 --> 00:03:15,696
Dude, relax. You're in a great spot.
You are the bad boy now.

72
00:03:15,779 --> 00:03:17,531
- I didn't do anything bad.
- So?

73
00:03:17,615 --> 00:03:20,326
Forbidden love, that's the key
to all great love stories.

74
00:03:20,409 --> 00:03:22,494
Romeo and Juliet,  dad hated him.

75
00:03:22,578 --> 00:03:25,664
Gnomeo and Juliet,  dad hated him.

76
00:03:25,748 --> 00:03:27,917
He's right.
Your next move, actually do drugs.

77
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,460
Or at least show up to school drunk.

78
00:03:29,543 --> 00:03:31,045
Take advantage of the situation.

79
00:03:31,128 --> 00:03:34,465
Then her dad will never let her see you
and you will be golden, my guy.

80
00:03:34,548 --> 00:03:36,467
He definitely already hates me.

81
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:40,346
Mya sent me phone emoji,
circle slash emoji, skull emoji,

82
00:03:40,429 --> 00:03:41,805
and then a screenshot of her contacts

83
00:03:41,889 --> 00:03:43,641
where she changed my number
to "Scam Likely."

84
00:03:43,724 --> 00:03:45,643
Yeah, you're toast. Good as droned.

85
00:03:45,726 --> 00:03:47,478
Maybe I should switch schools.

86
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:49,980
Or I could drop out
and move into the woods.

87
00:03:50,064 --> 00:03:53,359
Or... you kill Mister Perkins first.

88
00:03:53,442 --> 00:03:56,612
A preemptive strike.
Then you'll be the ultimate bad boy.

89
00:03:56,695 --> 00:03:59,615
I'm not gonna blow up Mister Perkins,
Miguel.

90
00:04:00,532 --> 00:04:02,618
I'm so tired of hanging out
with you losers.

91
00:04:03,661 --> 00:04:04,662
Where's Jay?

92
00:04:04,745 --> 00:04:07,289
I need help unloading my sculptures
and he's the only one mature enough

93
00:04:07,373 --> 00:04:08,791
not to comment on their erotic nature.

94
00:04:08,874 --> 00:04:12,044
They're all wangs.
You expect us not to comment on that?

95
00:04:12,127 --> 00:04:14,755
He's out of town on a job.
He'll be back tomorrow.

96
00:04:14,838 --> 00:04:17,883
I'd offer to help,
but I've got a big day today.

97
00:04:18,509 --> 00:04:21,178
Completely unreachable until 4:00.

98
00:04:22,429 --> 00:04:23,847
Anybody wanna ask me why?

99
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:28,143
All right. Well, ... my life then, huh?

100
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:32,606
- Mike.
-  Hmm.

101
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:34,400
- Come help me at the flea market.
-  I can't.

102
00:04:34,483 --> 00:04:37,736
There's a job fair at Primo's school.
I'm working the Army Recruitment booth.

103
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:40,030
Also, I do not wanna touch your penis art.

104
00:04:40,114 --> 00:04:41,782
It's not just "penis art."

105
00:04:41,865 --> 00:04:44,201
It's an artistic exploration
attempting to demystify

106
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:45,536
the phallus in our culture.

107
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:46,996
They've got veins.

108
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:48,288
Rollie?

109
00:04:48,372 --> 00:04:49,540
Hey, no, can do.

110
00:04:49,623 --> 00:04:52,584
I hooked up with the flea market mascot
who turned out to have crabs.

111
00:04:52,668 --> 00:04:55,254
They're crazy, right? A flea with crabs?

112
00:04:55,337 --> 00:04:58,132
Hey, life's a highway, man.

113
00:04:58,215 --> 00:05:00,217
They hired a new lady
to wear the flea costume.

114
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,136
- Come on.
- All right. I'm in.

115
00:05:02,219 --> 00:05:03,595
Can't get crabs twice.

116
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:09,810
Uh, Rafa, what are your plans today?

117
00:05:09,893 --> 00:05:10,978
Before you answer that,

118
00:05:11,061 --> 00:05:13,397
have you considered
working the job in recruitment fair

119
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,481
with your cool Uncle Mike?

120
00:05:14,565 --> 00:05:16,066
Not once have I considered that.

121
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:19,194
Come on. Help me out.
Competition this year is gonna be tough.

122
00:05:19,278 --> 00:05:21,739
The Navy guys,
they're using the swimming pool

123
00:05:21,822 --> 00:05:23,282
for Seal Team demonstrations.

124
00:05:23,365 --> 00:05:26,660
Mya's dad is doing the Air Force booth.
He brought a flight simulator.

125
00:05:26,744 --> 00:05:27,786
Mya's dad is gonna be there?

126
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:29,538
Yeah. A lot of people's dads
are gonna be there.

127
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:33,000
Well, if you really
need my help, then yeah, sure.

128
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:34,168
- Really?
-  Yeah.

129
00:05:34,251 --> 00:05:36,003
Okay. Cool. Yeah.

130
00:05:36,086 --> 00:05:38,589
You're finally gonna get
to see me do what I do.

131
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:40,215
We have an obstacle course.

132
00:05:40,299 --> 00:05:44,219
If a kid makes it all the way through,
boom, camouflage keychains.

133
00:05:44,303 --> 00:05:46,263
Why would you wanna
make keys harder to find?

134
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:50,350
See? You're already
a valuable member of the team.

135
00:05:50,434 --> 00:05:52,770
We're gonna go with the stress balls.

136
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:55,606
Let's go. You carry that.

137
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:58,400
- Have fun.
-  Bye.

138
00:05:58,484 --> 00:05:59,777
Okay. Love you.

139
00:06:00,944 --> 00:06:02,237
-  Bye.
- Bye.

140
00:06:04,406 --> 00:06:05,616
After you.

141
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:14,750
Gone, gone, out, gone, gone, gone.

142
00:06:16,001 --> 00:06:18,670
Oh, my God. They're all gone.

143
00:06:19,588 --> 00:06:21,882
Eight hours of nothing.

144
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:35,604
How's this? I arranged them all by size.

145
00:06:36,897 --> 00:06:39,274
I like it. It's like an erotic staircase.

146
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:48,700
Morning, Mondo. Great day for leather.
Real leather weather.

147
00:06:49,743 --> 00:06:51,036
Leave me alone, Gary.

148
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,956
You must be one of Mondo's many brothers.

149
00:06:54,039 --> 00:06:58,085
I'm Gary Morales.
But you can call me Leatherman.

150
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,505
Is this a leather business card?

151
00:07:01,588 --> 00:07:02,798
It sure is, peanut.

152
00:07:02,881 --> 00:07:05,008
And I only made one, so I need it back.

153
00:07:05,092 --> 00:07:07,594
Take a good look. Memorize it.

154
00:07:07,678 --> 00:07:10,764
- "Leatherman at Leatherman.biz."
- That's right.

155
00:07:11,849 --> 00:07:15,853
New drop today,  muchachos.
Business will be brisk.

156
00:07:15,936 --> 00:07:18,021
You don't mind if I take this, do you?

157
00:07:21,024 --> 00:07:22,651
Sorry about your dicks.

158
00:07:24,736 --> 00:07:26,697
- Hey, I'll be right back.
- Where are you going?

159
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:28,490
I'm gonna go cave this guy's head in.

160
00:07:28,574 --> 00:07:30,951
And I gotta do it quick,
so it doesn't become "premeditated."

161
00:07:31,034 --> 00:07:33,078
Rollie, violence is never right.

162
00:07:33,162 --> 00:07:34,955
Hey, what's the deal with this guy?

163
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:36,707
It's a long story.
And I don't wanna get into it.

164
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:38,834
We can just display
the sculptures on the blanket.

165
00:07:38,917 --> 00:07:40,210
It'll look more natural,

166
00:07:40,294 --> 00:07:42,671
like the penises
are growing out of the earth.

167
00:08:03,734 --> 00:08:05,903
Okay. So you're being extra weird today.

168
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:08,614
No, I'm not. My dream girl
is coming into the bank today.

169
00:08:08,697 --> 00:08:10,032
Priscilla Diaz.

170
00:08:10,115 --> 00:08:13,118
I've been handling her accounts
for three months now and I'm telling you,

171
00:08:13,202 --> 00:08:15,662
she is the one.
Today, we finally meet.

172
00:08:15,746 --> 00:08:17,706
She's "the one," and you've never met her?

173
00:08:17,789 --> 00:08:19,750
That's right.
I know everything I need to know.

174
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:21,376
She has a fully funded Roth IRA.

175
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:23,545
She moved her money
from fixed income and into equities

176
00:08:23,629 --> 00:08:26,173
to perfectly take advantage
of the bull market of 2021.

177
00:08:26,256 --> 00:08:27,925
So yeah, she's got it all.

178
00:08:28,008 --> 00:08:29,635
Why don't you just
be normal and date someone

179
00:08:29,718 --> 00:08:32,346
who you've actually
seen before like Claudia?

180
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:35,766
Claudia? She collects Beanie Babies.

181
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:37,100
Those are endangered animals.

182
00:08:37,184 --> 00:08:39,811
And she only gets those
because she donates to a wildlife charity.

183
00:08:39,895 --> 00:08:42,189
Oh, so she just gives her money away?
Uh, real smart.

184
00:08:42,272 --> 00:08:46,860
Priscilla Diaz would never do that.
Plus, she's only an account manager.

185
00:08:46,944 --> 00:08:48,612
- You're an account manager.
- Exactly.

186
00:08:48,695 --> 00:08:51,698
You date for the job you want,
not the job you have.

187
00:08:51,782 --> 00:08:55,285
The key to a successful
recruitment fair is determination.

188
00:08:55,369 --> 00:08:56,954
And discipline.

189
00:08:57,037 --> 00:08:58,205
And dedication.

190
00:08:58,830 --> 00:08:59,915
And bouncy castles.

191
00:08:59,998 --> 00:09:01,458
That's a lot of keys.

192
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,877
Maybe we should've
brought those keychains after all.

193
00:09:05,587 --> 00:09:08,590
Hi, Mr. Perkins. Sir.

194
00:09:08,674 --> 00:09:12,719
San Antonio's very own Nino Brown.
How's the crack cocaine business?

195
00:09:12,803 --> 00:09:15,931
Oh. Ha. Very funny joke.

196
00:09:16,014 --> 00:09:19,601
But I would never sell
crack cocaine or smoke it.

197
00:09:19,685 --> 00:09:23,855
I, I don't even crack jokes, or eggs,
or anything else that you can crack,

198
00:09:23,939 --> 00:09:25,565
especially cocaine.

199
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:27,818
Are you high right now?

200
00:09:29,444 --> 00:09:32,572
Another good one.
Wow. You're on a roll today, sir.

201
00:09:32,656 --> 00:09:36,368
No, of course, I'm not high.
High on patriotism, maybe.

202
00:09:36,451 --> 00:09:39,913
Other than that, completely sober.
Do you have a breathalyzer?

203
00:09:39,997 --> 00:09:43,292
Or a cup. Uh, you know, for pee?

204
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:46,753
I, I'd be... I'd be so happy
to give you some of my urine, sir.

205
00:09:46,837 --> 00:09:49,339
It would be an absolute honor
and a privilege.

206
00:09:49,423 --> 00:09:50,424
Just one without pens.

207
00:09:50,507 --> 00:09:52,092
I don't want your urine, Rafael.

208
00:09:53,051 --> 00:09:54,136
Right.

209
00:09:54,219 --> 00:09:57,848
Hey, bud.
I know what's going on here.

210
00:09:57,931 --> 00:09:59,182
You do?

211
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:01,935
I know you're scared.

212
00:10:02,019 --> 00:10:04,396
But this obstacle course
is completely safe.

213
00:10:04,479 --> 00:10:06,356
Why don't you give it
a practice run before we start?

214
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,191
- Come on. I'll time you.
-  I don't really...

215
00:10:08,275 --> 00:10:09,776
-  Ready?
-  Watch out.

216
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:11,069
Crawl and weave!

217
00:10:11,153 --> 00:10:13,655
Crawl and weave, Primo. Crawl and weave!

218
00:10:13,739 --> 00:10:15,907
Let's go! Let's go! Come on. Jump!

219
00:10:17,576 --> 00:10:20,746
Sniper got you.
You're dead. Start over.

220
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:28,503
All right. Shoes off.
I'll be back to time you.

221
00:10:30,005 --> 00:10:32,174
Remember, there's a lot
of jobs in the Army,

222
00:10:32,257 --> 00:10:34,259
it's not just combat.
That's important to tell these kids.

223
00:10:34,343 --> 00:10:35,886
- Uh-huh.
- And a good thing about having you here

224
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:37,429
is everyone will know right away clearly

225
00:10:37,512 --> 00:10:38,764
you do not have to fight.

226
00:10:38,847 --> 00:10:40,849
- Absolutely.
- This is fun, huh?

227
00:10:40,932 --> 00:10:42,601
You and me, quality time?

228
00:10:42,684 --> 00:10:45,103
Primo, let me run something by you.

229
00:10:45,187 --> 00:10:46,688
Why do you think
I don't have a girlfriend?

230
00:10:46,772 --> 00:10:49,608
I mean, I got the prescription deodorant,
so it's not that anymore.

231
00:10:49,691 --> 00:10:50,734
Yeah, totally.

232
00:10:55,989 --> 00:10:58,867
Hello there. I'm Ryan,
Senior Executive Account Manager.

233
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:01,078
It would be my honor to assist you

234
00:11:01,161 --> 00:11:04,581
with all your needs today,
Ms. Lisa Guzman?

235
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:07,584
Ugh. Paul can help you.

236
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:09,878
Paul? This chick needs something.

237
00:11:14,383 --> 00:11:16,927
Hey, do you want me to take over
greeting the customers?

238
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:19,221
'Cause you're being such a jackass today.

239
00:11:19,304 --> 00:11:21,556
I'm sorry. I'm fine. I got it. Yeah.

240
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:24,184
Oh, also apparently
the outdoor ATM is down.

241
00:11:24,267 --> 00:11:26,978
Yes. There's a McDonald's pancake
in the deposit slot.

242
00:11:27,062 --> 00:11:28,480
What?

243
00:11:28,563 --> 00:11:30,065
I'm sorry, I should be more clear.

244
00:11:30,148 --> 00:11:32,401
I stuffed a McDonald's pancake
in there so that it would break.

245
00:11:32,484 --> 00:11:33,944
So then everybody would have to come in,

246
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:36,321
and then I can finally meet
the woman that I'm in love with.

247
00:11:36,405 --> 00:11:39,991
Oh. Today is the day you meet
"Investment account ending in 6421?"

248
00:11:40,075 --> 00:11:43,912
Yup. Claudia, let me ask you a question.
Imagine that you work at a bank.

249
00:11:43,995 --> 00:11:46,164
- I do work in a bank.
- Great. Stay with that.

250
00:11:46,248 --> 00:11:48,333
Now, imagine that you're trying
to impress a client

251
00:11:48,417 --> 00:11:50,877
whose account information
you are very familiar with.

252
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:55,298
Which of these ties would you choose?

253
00:11:57,175 --> 00:11:58,885
I think you look good in both.

254
00:12:00,595 --> 00:12:04,683
Well, great. That's not helpful.
Thanks for nothing, Anna Wintour.

255
00:12:27,914 --> 00:12:32,794
What is...
He's never even seen the sunlight, it's...

256
00:12:38,383 --> 00:12:43,221
She led him to the stockroom,
where he revealed his inventory.

257
00:12:46,016 --> 00:12:49,603
Oh, his, his rising inventory.

258
00:12:49,686 --> 00:12:52,772
Oh, that's good. Rising.

259
00:12:52,856 --> 00:12:55,317
That's so good, Esther. Yeah.

260
00:13:06,036 --> 00:13:08,205
The baby has amnesia?

261
00:13:09,623 --> 00:13:11,583
Oh, my God.

262
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:30,685
Leather underwear. Leather visor.
Ma'am?

263
00:13:30,769 --> 00:13:35,273
Leather onesie for the little one?
It's treated. The poop slides right off.

264
00:13:35,357 --> 00:13:36,399
No, thanks.

265
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:40,362
No? Your baby's ugly anyway.

266
00:13:46,409 --> 00:13:49,371
Hey! You got mud on our blanket!

267
00:13:49,454 --> 00:13:52,541
You should've put your stuff on a table.

268
00:13:52,624 --> 00:13:54,584
Rollie, don't.

269
00:13:54,668 --> 00:13:56,962
Hey, you gotta tell me
what's up with this guy.

270
00:13:57,754 --> 00:14:00,799
Believe it or not,
Leatherman used to be my best friend.

271
00:14:00,882 --> 00:14:02,634
Back then, he was just "Gary."

272
00:14:05,303 --> 00:14:07,514
It was the end
of strawberry season.

273
00:14:07,597 --> 00:14:10,016
After the harvest,
we both had money to spend.

274
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:12,435
I have a business proposition for you.

275
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:16,815
There's a cattle auction coming to town.
What if you and I went in half on a cow?

276
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:21,486
I was thrilled.
It was like having a thousand-pound dog.

277
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:23,989
That cow and I,
we had a spiritual connection.

278
00:14:24,072 --> 00:14:26,491
Like we had been friends in a past life.

279
00:14:27,284 --> 00:14:29,202
Good girl!

280
00:14:29,286 --> 00:14:31,079
I thought he loved her as much as I did.

281
00:14:31,162 --> 00:14:35,083
But soon I discovered
that he had very different intentions.

282
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:38,336
Everything went great!
We should at least double our money.

283
00:14:39,713 --> 00:14:41,673
How could you do this?

284
00:14:41,756 --> 00:14:46,845
I lost two friends that day.
The cow died and Gary did, too.

285
00:14:47,929 --> 00:14:49,806
Leatherman was born in his place.

286
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:54,561
Yo, I remember Gary now.
From years ago. Yeah, that guy's a dick.

287
00:14:54,644 --> 00:14:57,022
Hey, you're carving them for a living,

288
00:14:57,105 --> 00:14:59,691
but can't see when there's
a human one right in front of you?

289
00:14:59,774 --> 00:15:02,235
You know
what the difference between us is?

290
00:15:02,319 --> 00:15:06,156
That I choose peace.
That's why I've never been to jail.

291
00:15:08,074 --> 00:15:12,621
Except for that time that I did ayahuasca
and went into the IHOP without pants.

292
00:15:12,704 --> 00:15:16,625
Hey, look, you don't want me to fight him?
I won't fight him.

293
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:19,044
But you gotta stand up for yourself.

294
00:15:19,127 --> 00:15:23,381
If not for you, then do it for...
uh, what was your dog cow's name?

295
00:15:23,465 --> 00:15:24,633
Moo-chelle Pfeiffer.

296
00:15:24,716 --> 00:15:26,384
Yeah, Moo-chelle.

297
00:15:26,468 --> 00:15:28,219
You're under enemy fire.

298
00:15:28,303 --> 00:15:32,474
Your platoon is the last hope
to get this nuclear warhead to safety.

299
00:15:32,557 --> 00:15:36,061
The fate of the United States
of America is in your hands.

300
00:15:36,144 --> 00:15:37,562
Godspeed.

301
00:15:42,901 --> 00:15:45,654
Juan! Too slow! You're dead.
Pass the nuke to Carla.

302
00:15:45,737 --> 00:15:47,530
- Hey, are you timing this?
- Yeah, sorry.

303
00:15:47,614 --> 00:15:51,409
Uh, Carla's got 20 seconds left
before that bomb destroys San Antonio.

304
00:15:51,493 --> 00:15:53,370
Excuse me just one sec.

305
00:15:53,453 --> 00:15:56,539
Leave him behind, Carla!
It's too late for him!

306
00:15:56,623 --> 00:15:57,749
Keep going!

307
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:04,130
Ah, the old, uh, F-15 Strike Eagle.

308
00:16:04,214 --> 00:16:06,341
- Yeah.
- Nice.

309
00:16:08,843 --> 00:16:10,553
Mind if I give her a whirl?

310
00:16:13,056 --> 00:16:15,892
Well, the Olive Garden recruiter
brought out the free breadsticks

311
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:20,313
and everyone ran over there,
so, sure. Go crazy.

312
00:16:20,397 --> 00:16:23,191
- Okay.
- Let's get you set up here.

313
00:16:29,531 --> 00:16:31,199
I think I see.

314
00:16:31,282 --> 00:16:33,660
Yeah. Check her out.

315
00:16:44,504 --> 00:16:46,881
Direct hit. Not bad.

316
00:16:51,094 --> 00:16:52,220
Thank you, sir.

317
00:16:52,303 --> 00:16:54,556
- Enjoy that leather toilet seat cover.
- I will.

318
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:59,352
Man, I'm crushing carcass today.
How's the wooden dick business?

319
00:16:59,436 --> 00:17:02,147
Ironically, it looks like a soft market.

320
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:06,609
Hey, take your revenge.
Do it for Moo-chelle.

321
00:17:06,693 --> 00:17:10,155
Oh, is that what you're thinking about?

322
00:17:10,238 --> 00:17:13,950
Your old cow friend?
That is hilarious.

323
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:18,246
She was my first murdered cow.
I still wear her sometimes, Mondo.

324
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:23,293
She tanned up good. Real good.

325
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:31,760
No! My leather goods!

326
00:17:44,731 --> 00:17:47,609
Look me in the eyes, Gary.
Look me in the eye...

327
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:53,823
This revenge had a lot more urine
than I was anticipating.

328
00:17:53,907 --> 00:17:55,533
How much is it usually?

329
00:17:55,617 --> 00:17:56,826
Zero.

330
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:58,495
Uh-hmm.

331
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:06,961
Nice job.
One of the best scores I've seen all day.

332
00:18:07,962 --> 00:18:08,963
Thank you.

333
00:18:10,632 --> 00:18:12,342
I appreciate you letting me test her out.

334
00:18:12,425 --> 00:18:13,676
What are you doing?

335
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,720
Destroying tanks
with heat-seeking missiles.

336
00:18:15,804 --> 00:18:19,015
Wack. You're supposed to be
helping me at the Army booth.

337
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:21,059
I was counting on you and you let me down.

338
00:18:21,142 --> 00:18:22,685
Seems like you let each other down.

339
00:18:22,769 --> 00:18:25,438
Oh, no.
Evacuate the obstacle course!

340
00:18:25,522 --> 00:18:26,731
You are in danger!

341
00:18:26,815 --> 00:18:29,317
The structural integrity
has been compromised!

342
00:18:31,611 --> 00:18:33,112
- Army.
-  Evacuate now!

343
00:18:33,196 --> 00:18:36,449
He'll be fine.
He's very good at evacuations.

344
00:18:37,742 --> 00:18:40,537
He doesn't give a crap
about helping me recruit kids

345
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,956
into the armed forces.
It's basically treason!

346
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:45,542
- What?
-   He lied to me, Drea!

347
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:47,168
- Yeah.
-   And I know you think

348
00:18:47,252 --> 00:18:48,878
I get defensive about defending America,

349
00:18:48,962 --> 00:18:50,255
- but defending America...
- No, no, I think you're great,

350
00:18:50,338 --> 00:18:51,422
uh, in America.

351
00:18:51,506 --> 00:18:52,841
...is literally my job.

352
00:18:52,924 --> 00:18:55,635
I have dedicated my life
to making us all safe.

353
00:18:55,718 --> 00:19:00,598
And the first rule of boot camp, Drea,
is that you respect your uncle.

354
00:19:00,682 --> 00:19:03,726
That is why they call him Uncle Sam, Drea.

355
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:05,228
Family is important.

356
00:19:05,311 --> 00:19:06,563
That's what I'm saying!

357
00:19:06,646 --> 00:19:09,107
Well, I'm sure
you and Ryan will work it out, okay?

358
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:10,358
Talk soon.

359
00:19:14,112 --> 00:19:16,531
Drea? Ryan's...

360
00:19:16,614 --> 00:19:18,700
I'm not with Ryan!

361
00:19:19,701 --> 00:19:21,661
God.

362
00:19:21,744 --> 00:19:25,331
Just leave it alone. I'll do it myself.
Just like I did all day.

363
00:19:29,252 --> 00:19:31,713
Uncle Mike, uh, that's my bad, okay?

364
00:19:31,796 --> 00:19:36,092
Apologies not accepted.
We were supposed to be working in tandem,

365
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:39,679
to recruit soldiers and improve
the strength and might of the US military.

366
00:19:39,762 --> 00:19:41,097
And...

367
00:19:42,682 --> 00:19:44,809
- you hurt my feelings.
- I know.

368
00:19:44,893 --> 00:19:47,645
It's just, Mya's dad kinda hates me,

369
00:19:47,729 --> 00:19:51,566
and he's not gonna let Mya
hang out with me if he hates me.

370
00:19:51,649 --> 00:19:53,359
So I thought I could,

371
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:58,323
I don't know, just spend some time
with him, try to get him on my side.

372
00:19:58,406 --> 00:20:01,034
Well, whatever. You shouldn't have lied.

373
00:20:01,117 --> 00:20:04,662
And your mom, I called her about it,
she completely agrees with me.

374
00:20:06,247 --> 00:20:09,334
Yeah.
Yeah. I know.

375
00:20:19,093 --> 00:20:20,803
Maybe she'll come next Saturday.

376
00:20:20,887 --> 00:20:23,681
I guess.
You want some charcuterie?

377
00:20:23,765 --> 00:20:25,058
Sure.

378
00:20:25,141 --> 00:20:27,143
Nope. That ham is sweaty.

379
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:30,521
Yeah, this ham is fully wet. Mm.

380
00:20:30,605 --> 00:20:31,606
Do not eat that.

381
00:20:32,357 --> 00:20:33,483
Yeah.

382
00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:37,236
Hey, thanks for being so cool today.
I'm sorry if I was a little nutty.

383
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:38,488
It's okay.

384
00:20:38,571 --> 00:20:41,324
Or it's actually not "okay,"
because you're deeply weird,

385
00:20:41,407 --> 00:20:43,785
but it's enough "okay"
that I can tell you it's okay.

386
00:20:43,868 --> 00:20:46,037
Do you have any plans tonight?

387
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:48,998
Me and some friends
are going to a concert downtown.

388
00:20:49,082 --> 00:20:50,208
You into music?

389
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:51,250
Hmm.

390
00:20:51,334 --> 00:20:52,877
Come on, what's your favorite album?

391
00:20:52,961 --> 00:20:54,837
Oh, no. You're gonna think it's stupid.

392
00:20:54,921 --> 00:20:56,339
Probably.

393
00:20:57,590 --> 00:21:01,386
It's  Unleash the Champion Inside You,
by Bernie Snorkis.

394
00:21:01,469 --> 00:21:03,137
He's a motivational speaker.

395
00:21:03,221 --> 00:21:05,181
Yup, stupid.

396
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:08,142
I know. It's just, I try
to focus on my career and my future,

397
00:21:08,226 --> 00:21:10,228
so I don't spend a lot
of time listening to music.

398
00:21:10,311 --> 00:21:13,606
I'm gonna make you a playlist.
You need normal, human interests.

399
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:14,774
Thanks.

400
00:21:14,857 --> 00:21:16,609
And I'll make you
a playlist of my favorite

401
00:21:16,693 --> 00:21:18,111
motivational speeches and TED Talks.

402
00:21:18,194 --> 00:21:20,738
- Please do not do that.
- Absolutely not, I won't.

403
00:21:23,825 --> 00:21:25,535
We'll release you,
but only once you've paid

404
00:21:25,618 --> 00:21:26,995
for the merchandise you destroyed.

405
00:21:27,078 --> 00:21:30,832
I can't. My only assets are 32 sculptures
and an antique pan flute.

406
00:21:30,915 --> 00:21:33,751
Then I want him banned
from the flea market for life,

407
00:21:33,835 --> 00:21:35,545
and extradited to Mexico.

408
00:21:35,628 --> 00:21:37,672
"Extradited?"
You know I'm not the government, right?

409
00:21:37,755 --> 00:21:39,215
This flea market
is the only way I have to make money.

410
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:41,342
I am not going back
to selling these door to door.

411
00:21:41,426 --> 00:21:42,969
I got punched too many times.

412
00:21:43,928 --> 00:21:45,096
Hey, how about this, Gary.

413
00:21:45,179 --> 00:21:47,724
You screwed Mondo
out of half a cow back in the day.

414
00:21:47,807 --> 00:21:49,559
Hey, what do you say we call it even?

415
00:21:49,642 --> 00:21:52,103
That was two hundred bucks,  amigo.

416
00:21:52,186 --> 00:21:54,188
He ruined way more than that.

417
00:21:54,272 --> 00:21:55,690
You didn't let me finish.

418
00:21:55,773 --> 00:21:57,525
Hey, what do you say we call it even,

419
00:21:57,608 --> 00:21:59,402
or I follow you home
and cave your head in?

420
00:21:59,485 --> 00:22:01,696
That was a threat. Do something!

421
00:22:01,779 --> 00:22:03,114
Again, I'm not the government.

422
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:05,533
Fine.

423
00:22:06,451 --> 00:22:07,869
Fine!

424
00:22:09,829 --> 00:22:12,415
I can't believe
how much anger I was holding in.

425
00:22:12,498 --> 00:22:15,710
I can't believe you flipped over a table.
Hey, we should hang out more often.

426
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:20,214
Hey, I'm glad you stood up to that guy.
Some fights are worth fighting.

427
00:22:20,298 --> 00:22:22,967
I mean, to me,
all fights are worth fighting.

428
00:22:23,051 --> 00:22:25,094
But still, good for you.

429
00:22:27,138 --> 00:22:29,307
Hey, what are you doing? I peed on that.

430
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:32,268
I'm gonna hose it down
and take it to the biker bar and sell it.

431
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:34,062
There are so many foul smells
coming out of that place,

432
00:22:34,145 --> 00:22:36,939
- they won't even notice.
- I get a 50-50 split.

433
00:22:37,023 --> 00:22:40,401
Hey, look at you.
Standing up for yourself.

434
00:22:40,485 --> 00:22:43,112
But no, I'm keeping all the money.

435
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:45,198
Okay.

436
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:54,373
Hey. Good turnout?

437
00:22:54,457 --> 00:22:55,750
It was okay. How about you?

438
00:22:55,833 --> 00:22:59,253
Eh. A little worried about these kids,
I think they might be a bit soft.

439
00:22:59,337 --> 00:23:00,379
Definitely.

440
00:23:00,463 --> 00:23:02,090
My whole presentation was a video game.

441
00:23:02,173 --> 00:23:04,217
And a bunch of them asked me
if I worked for GameStop.

442
00:23:05,843 --> 00:23:06,969
I don't.

443
00:23:08,304 --> 00:23:13,142
Hey, listen, um,
I'm sorry if Primo was a little weird.

444
00:23:13,226 --> 00:23:15,937
He's under a lot of pressure
but he's a good kid.

445
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:17,730
He was raised to respect his elders,

446
00:23:17,814 --> 00:23:19,565
I think he was just trying
to make a good impression.

447
00:23:19,649 --> 00:23:20,733
Is that right?

448
00:23:21,859 --> 00:23:23,986
Maybe some of the things
Mya says about him are true.

449
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:25,905
They are. Unless they were bad.

450
00:23:25,988 --> 00:23:28,741
In which case, your daughter is a liar.
Have a good night.

451
00:23:30,701 --> 00:23:33,204
I'm glad I did not go to that barbecue.

452
00:23:35,498 --> 00:23:36,916
Thanks for coming today.

453
00:23:36,999 --> 00:23:38,918
To be honest,
I didn't really need your help.

454
00:23:39,001 --> 00:23:41,379
You're actually pretty useless.
Militarily, I mean.

455
00:23:41,462 --> 00:23:43,381
I just thought it might be cool
to hang with you a little.

456
00:23:44,924 --> 00:23:46,259
You hungry?

457
00:23:46,342 --> 00:23:48,136
Oh, my God, I'm starving.

458
00:23:48,219 --> 00:23:50,638
I was too scared to eat
in front of Mya's dad.

459
00:23:50,721 --> 00:23:53,474
I just felt like I was gonna get
something on my shirt, like always.

460
00:23:53,558 --> 00:23:55,226
We'll get burgers on the way home.

461
00:23:55,309 --> 00:23:59,021
By the way,
Mya talks to her dad about you.

462
00:23:59,105 --> 00:24:00,356
You talked to him?

463
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:02,900
Military kids don't talk
to their dads about anything,

464
00:24:02,984 --> 00:24:06,821
so if she's talking about you,
that's a good sign.

465
00:24:06,904 --> 00:24:08,656
For real?

466
00:24:08,739 --> 00:24:11,075
That's kinda high-level intel you get

467
00:24:11,159 --> 00:24:13,077
when you hang out
with your cool Uncle Mike.

468
00:24:13,161 --> 00:24:14,662
He was there too?

469
00:24:14,745 --> 00:24:15,955
Get in the truck.

470
00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:35,850
Hey, Ma. We got burgers for everyone.

471
00:24:35,933 --> 00:24:39,520
We executed a search
and rescue today, Drea.

472
00:24:39,604 --> 00:24:40,980
- Whole team's beat.
- Oh yeah?

473
00:24:41,063 --> 00:24:43,149
- Yeah.
- Hey, sis, I need, ammonia,

474
00:24:43,232 --> 00:24:44,317
bleach, and a barrel.

475
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,027
That's going to create mustard gas.

476
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:47,737
Yeah, but I gotta get the piss out
of these leather clothes

477
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:49,614
- I'm gonna sell to a biker gang.
- What?

478
00:24:49,697 --> 00:24:50,907
Thank you.

479
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:52,867
Well, I may never find love.

480
00:24:54,327 --> 00:24:57,663
Play Bernie Snorkis motivational quotes.

481
00:24:57,747 --> 00:25:00,416
If you're poor,
it's your fault. Bernie Snorkis...

482
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:02,001
Man, shut that off.

483
00:25:02,084 --> 00:25:04,545
I need water. I think I'm dehydrated.

484
00:25:04,629 --> 00:25:06,047
Oh, nice.

485
00:25:09,842 --> 00:25:11,510
I got ketchup on my shirt.

486
00:25:11,594 --> 00:25:14,180
You haven't even started eating.
Your burger is still wrapped!

487
00:25:14,263 --> 00:25:15,932
I told you. This is what happens.

488
00:25:17,058 --> 00:25:19,477
You're right, you did tell me.

489
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:21,062
- How'd y'all's day go?
-  Well, it was pretty good.

490
00:25:21,145 --> 00:25:22,688
-  Oh, man.
-  ...Moo-chelle Pfeiffer

491
00:25:22,772 --> 00:25:24,232
and peed on a dead carcass...

492
00:25:24,315 --> 00:25:25,942
Yeah, there was the Leatherman guy.

493
00:25:26,025 --> 00:25:27,401
And he tried to fight me but I was like,

494
00:25:27,485 --> 00:25:28,819
"No, you're not gonna be able
to fight me."

495
00:25:38,037 --> 00:25:40,957
I'm good. Really good.

496
00:25:49,799 --> 00:25:51,676
Is this is a leather onesie?

497
00:25:51,759 --> 00:25:53,427
It sure is, peanut.

498
00:26:56,615 --> 00:26:58,034
Next on  Primo...

499
00:26:58,117 --> 00:26:59,702
What if she goes off and gets a boyfriend?

500
00:26:59,785 --> 00:27:01,746
- At math camp?
- I just have to tell her.

501
00:27:01,829 --> 00:27:03,039
Let me just walk you through it,
step by step.

502
00:27:03,122 --> 00:27:04,081
How'd you keep this from us?

503
00:27:04,165 --> 00:27:05,249
Easy, you're all oblivious.

504
00:27:05,333 --> 00:27:07,168
We need to trust that
Drea knows what she's doing.

505
00:27:07,251 --> 00:27:08,169
We don't have any infor.

506
00:27:08,252 --> 00:27:09,587
- Hey.
- Hey.

507
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:11,464
- You wanna take a walk?
- Any final questions?

508
00:27:11,547 --> 00:27:13,591
I think there's something
you need to know.

509
00:27:14,425 --> 00:27:15,551
What?
