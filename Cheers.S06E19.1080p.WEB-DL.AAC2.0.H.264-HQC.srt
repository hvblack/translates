1
00:00:01,949 --> 00:00:05,732
Cheers is filmed
before a live studio audience.

2
00:00:06,303 --> 00:00:09,441
Whoa, Cliffie,
new Weekly Gabber I see, huh?

3
00:00:09,441 --> 00:00:11,619
Yeah, you betcha.
Look at this headline here.

4
00:00:11,619 --> 00:00:15,511
"Suicidal Twin Kills
Brother by Mistake."

5
00:00:15,696 --> 00:00:19,198
Oh, Cliff,
you don't actually believe
that pack of lies, do you?

6
00:00:19,233 --> 00:00:23,103
Well, Dr. Crane, it just
shows you how much you know
about free press
here in America.

7
00:00:23,137 --> 00:00:25,922
I mean, uh, they can't print it
unless it's the truth.

8
00:00:25,957 --> 00:00:29,211
Well, granted, you know,
some of these stories
might be a bit exaggerated,

9
00:00:29,243 --> 00:00:33,613
but, uh, I guarantee you
at the core of each
is the kernel of truth.
Allow me to demonstrate.

10
00:00:33,647 --> 00:00:36,048
Hey, hey.
Come here, fella.

11
00:00:36,048 --> 00:00:40,153
Listen, I just won
five bucks in the lottery.
Pass it on, will ya?

12
00:00:40,188 --> 00:00:42,055
Thanks a lot.

13
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:44,908
The truth
has begun its journey
now around the bar.

14
00:00:44,942 --> 00:00:47,477
When it returns, it
may be a little bit
distorted, you know.

15
00:00:47,511 --> 00:00:49,281
People will be saying
I won $500,

16
00:00:49,281 --> 00:00:51,414
maybe $5,000,
maybe five million dollars,

17
00:00:51,414 --> 00:00:55,976
but I guarantee you
the essence of the message
will be the truth.

18
00:00:55,976 --> 00:00:59,405
Hey, Norm, get this.
Some geek brain's all jazzed

19
00:00:59,439 --> 00:01:01,731
because he just won five bucks.

20
00:01:03,761 --> 00:01:05,694
Touche.

21
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:14,420
¶ Making your way
in the world today ¶

22
00:01:14,455 --> 00:01:17,406
¶ Takes everything you've got.

23
00:01:17,441 --> 00:01:20,243
¶ Taking a break
from all your worries ¶

24
00:01:20,277 --> 00:01:23,446
¶ Sure would help a lot.

25
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:27,518
¶ Wouldn't you like
to get away? ¶

26
00:01:28,785 --> 00:01:31,454
¶ Sometimes you want to go.

27
00:01:31,489 --> 00:01:35,751
¶ Where everybody
knows your name ¶

28
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:41,080
¶ And they're always glad
you came ¶

29
00:01:41,349 --> 00:01:43,831
¶ You want to be
where you can see ¶

30
00:01:43,831 --> 00:01:46,420
¶ Our troubles
are all the same ¶

31
00:01:46,454 --> 00:01:51,491
¶ You want to be where everybody
knows your name ¶

32
00:01:51,525 --> 00:01:54,228
¶ You want to go
where people know ¶

33
00:01:54,262 --> 00:01:56,763
¶ People are all the same.

34
00:01:56,797 --> 00:02:01,765
¶ You want to go where
everybody knows your name. ¶

35
00:02:18,486 --> 00:02:20,436
Listen up, everyone.

36
00:02:20,471 --> 00:02:23,206
One of the most influential
reviewers in the city

37
00:02:23,241 --> 00:02:26,559
has been going around
to different bars in the area
reviewing them.

38
00:02:26,594 --> 00:02:28,632
Need I say more?

39
00:02:28,824 --> 00:02:30,865
Yes.

40
00:02:33,184 --> 00:02:37,470
Woody, in case he comes in here,
I want everybody
on his best behavior.

41
00:02:37,504 --> 00:02:42,192
Aw, gee, does this mean
we're going to have to cancel
the midget tossing contest?

42
00:02:42,226 --> 00:02:45,875
Sam, please don't
joke about this.
This really means a lot to me.

43
00:02:45,875 --> 00:02:47,663
Oh, don't worry about it.
I'm sure we'll do great.

44
00:02:47,698 --> 00:02:52,507
As long as the reviewer
doesn't happen to be
that SOB Murray Treadwell.
You remember him?

45
00:02:52,507 --> 00:02:55,888
Well, I'm not saying it is,
but what if it were?

46
00:02:55,922 --> 00:02:58,740
Well, then you better
kiss your butt good-bye.

47
00:02:59,293 --> 00:03:03,229
Actually, that sounds
more like a job for me,
doesn't it?

48
00:03:05,265 --> 00:03:07,417
What's the matter with him?

49
00:03:07,451 --> 00:03:09,920
He's a hater.
The guy hates everybody.

50
00:03:09,954 --> 00:03:11,304
I hate people like that.

51
00:03:11,304 --> 00:03:15,616
Yeah.
He gave Cheers a really bad
review a couple years ago.

52
00:03:15,616 --> 00:03:18,837
Really bad.
I almost stopped coming here.

53
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,214
What did he say?

54
00:03:21,249 --> 00:03:24,484
- A bar full of bores.
- Yeah, oafish clientele.

55
00:03:24,518 --> 00:03:26,085
Dumb lug of a bartender.

56
00:03:26,119 --> 00:03:29,022
Well, we're under
new management here.
A lot of things have changed.

57
00:03:29,056 --> 00:03:30,911
Like what?

58
00:03:32,176 --> 00:03:34,844
We have ferns.

59
00:03:35,163 --> 00:03:37,013
Didn't he say anything nice?

60
00:03:37,047 --> 00:03:41,766
Yes, as a matter of fact,
he said
the one saving grace was
the refreshing lack of ferns.

61
00:03:42,252 --> 00:03:44,520
You guys are just
trying to rattle me.

62
00:03:44,554 --> 00:03:45,989
With the changes I've instituted

63
00:03:46,023 --> 00:03:49,555
and with Carla locked
in the storage closet,
everything's going to be fine.

64
00:03:49,555 --> 00:03:52,255
86 the ferns, Woody.

65
00:03:53,196 --> 00:03:54,964
Hi, guys.

66
00:03:54,999 --> 00:03:58,461
Oh, Carla, Eddie called
and said he got a job
as a penguin.

67
00:03:58,461 --> 00:04:02,304
Great!
Hey, did you hear that,
everybody?

68
00:04:02,339 --> 00:04:05,558
My husband just hooked on
with the Pittsburgh Penguins.

69
00:04:05,592 --> 00:04:06,926
Hey, that's great.

70
00:04:06,961 --> 00:04:09,011
Pittsburgh... they're an
up-and-coming club, huh?

71
00:04:09,046 --> 00:04:12,490
I'd say Eddie LeBec is
on his way to becoming a legend.

72
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:15,885
Gee, Cliff, what a great thing
to say, thanks.

73
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:18,139
I meant every word of it, Carla.

74
00:04:18,139 --> 00:04:20,349
Can Eddie get us tickets?

75
00:04:20,525 --> 00:04:24,729
You know, what I like
best about that team...
Is their uniforms.

76
00:04:24,729 --> 00:04:28,660
I mean, the Penguin uniforms
are far and away
the coolest in the league.

77
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:31,203
Hey,
everybody!

78
00:04:34,288 --> 00:04:36,873
- Eddie?
- Who else could it be?

79
00:04:36,907 --> 00:04:40,919
Wow, Carla, are their home
uniforms that neat-looking too?

80
00:04:41,663 --> 00:04:44,888
Hey, Carla, listen.
It's been breaking me up,

81
00:04:44,888 --> 00:04:49,419
you know, not being able
to find work,
not being able to
support you and the kids.

82
00:04:49,453 --> 00:04:52,622
It's like I was
losing myself as a man.

83
00:04:52,656 --> 00:04:55,965
Well, now, you know,
I got a job.
Aren't you proud of me?

84
00:04:55,965 --> 00:04:58,988
Eddie, take off your beak.

85
00:04:59,681 --> 00:05:02,698
This is a joke, right?
You're with Pittsburgh.

86
00:05:02,733 --> 00:05:06,952
Pittsburgh?
No, I'm with
the Wonderful World of Ice.

87
00:05:06,987 --> 00:05:10,719
You know, that big ice show.
They're hiring lots
of hockey players like me.

88
00:05:10,719 --> 00:05:14,373
Hey, at least you
won't have to worry
about renting a tux, Eddie.

89
00:05:14,612 --> 00:05:18,734
Yeah, what are they
paying you, Ed?
Seven, eight fish a day?

90
00:05:19,483 --> 00:05:22,368
Hey, you guys, knock it off.
He's got himself an honest job.

91
00:05:22,402 --> 00:05:24,212
He gets paid.

92
00:05:24,212 --> 00:05:27,489
He, um...
come on, help me out here, man.

93
00:05:27,489 --> 00:05:30,142
All right, all right.
Can it, you clowns.

94
00:05:30,177 --> 00:05:33,245
You know, a lot of people
criticize hockey players.

95
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,214
They say they're
wasting their time.

96
00:05:35,214 --> 00:05:38,034
After their careers are over
they're not prepared
for anything.

97
00:05:38,068 --> 00:05:41,571
- Well, my Eddie just
proved them wrong.
- Thank you, Carla.

98
00:05:41,605 --> 00:05:44,757
You walked around in
public in that thing?

99
00:05:44,792 --> 00:05:47,200
I thought you'd get
a kick out of it.

100
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:51,580
Listen, uh, Carla,
I got to fly
to Seattle tomorrow.

101
00:05:51,615 --> 00:05:54,150
You can't fly in
that thing, can you?

102
00:05:55,686 --> 00:05:58,504
No, Woody, I'm going
on an airplane.

103
00:05:58,539 --> 00:06:01,641
I know, I mean you're not going
to fly in that thing, are you?

104
00:06:01,675 --> 00:06:06,863
Seattle?
I just... I can't believe
you're going to be
that far away.

105
00:06:06,897 --> 00:06:10,650
It won't be that long.
Look, I'll call you every day.

106
00:06:10,684 --> 00:06:13,286
Hey, maybe you want
to come out and see me, huh?

107
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:16,906
Yeah. Yeah, well...
you know, it's really
a long way, Eddie.

108
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:19,809
We'll talk about it
tonight, okay?
What do you want for dinner?

109
00:06:19,843 --> 00:06:23,632
I don't know.
I kind of got the urge
for mackerel.

110
00:06:24,665 --> 00:06:28,801
- Gee, I'm sure going
to miss you, Carla.
- Well, who wouldn't?

111
00:06:28,836 --> 00:06:31,788
You know, not to be
overly sentimental,

112
00:06:31,822 --> 00:06:34,922
but you're the best
husband I ever had.

113
00:06:34,922 --> 00:06:38,310
- I'll see you, Carla.
- Yeah, see ya...

114
00:06:38,345 --> 00:06:40,006
Penguin.

115
00:06:40,674 --> 00:06:44,882
I wonder where couples get
those cute little names
they call each other.

116
00:06:52,325 --> 00:06:54,727
Well, soon.

117
00:06:54,762 --> 00:06:57,630
Eddie, look, I just can't
fly out of here.

118
00:06:57,664 --> 00:07:00,332
Are you forgetting
I got seven kids?

119
00:07:00,367 --> 00:07:02,626
Oh, right, eight.

120
00:07:02,937 --> 00:07:06,128
Look, look, I'd love to
talk to you some more,
but Sam's calling me.

121
00:07:06,128 --> 00:07:07,274
What?

122
00:07:07,675 --> 00:07:10,099
Be right there, Sam.

123
00:07:10,277 --> 00:07:12,779
Okay, I'll talk to you
tomorrow then, bye.

124
00:07:12,813 --> 00:07:15,714
Hey, uh, Carla,
I couldn't help but notice

125
00:07:15,749 --> 00:07:19,050
that Eddie calls you
every single day
asking you to go out there,

126
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:20,837
and you just keep
giving him the brush-off.

127
00:07:20,871 --> 00:07:23,556
I mean, hey, what gives here,
little lady?

128
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:26,025
Drop it.
Or I'll set your face on fire

129
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:28,895
and beat out the flames
with your butt.

130
00:07:29,997 --> 00:07:33,750
Well, does that satisfy
your curiosity, Cliff?

131
00:07:34,585 --> 00:07:35,535
Totally.

132
00:07:35,569 --> 00:07:39,555
But it does raise
a series of other questions.

133
00:07:40,774 --> 00:07:43,712
Hey, hey, hey.
That restaurant
critic guy's here.

134
00:07:43,712 --> 00:07:45,478
- Where?
- Right over there, see?

135
00:07:45,512 --> 00:07:47,897
Oh, my God.
How do I look, Sam?

136
00:07:47,931 --> 00:07:50,299
You've got a little drool
on the corner of
your mouth there.

137
00:07:50,333 --> 00:07:51,818
No, no, no, leave it.

138
00:07:51,852 --> 00:07:53,319
I think I better
go see what he wants.

139
00:07:53,354 --> 00:07:56,494
- No, relax. Carla's got it.
- Oh, my God!

140
00:08:02,062 --> 00:08:04,012
Carla, you don't mind, do you?

141
00:08:04,047 --> 00:08:05,523
Not at all.

142
00:08:05,523 --> 00:08:08,756
When you're through,
there's a table
of six in the corner.

143
00:08:09,319 --> 00:08:10,886
Hello.

144
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:13,922
You're Murray Treadwell,
aren't you?

145
00:08:13,957 --> 00:08:18,278
Yes, and you must be one
of the Flying Wallendas.

146
00:08:18,846 --> 00:08:21,513
No, I'm Rebecca Howe.
I'm the new manager here.

147
00:08:21,548 --> 00:08:25,394
- I hope you enjoy
your visit here.
- Oh, I'm sure I will.

148
00:08:25,394 --> 00:08:29,008
- Would you like a drink?
- That seems vaguely appropriate.

149
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:30,372
I'll get it.

150
00:08:31,158 --> 00:08:33,692
You probably want
something specific.

151
00:08:33,727 --> 00:08:36,979
- How about a vodka martini?
- Excellent choice.

152
00:08:37,013 --> 00:08:39,816
Anything special?
Stirred, shaken, two olives?

153
00:08:39,850 --> 00:08:41,350
A little sword?

154
00:08:41,385 --> 00:08:44,654
- I'd like it today.
- Coming right up.

155
00:08:44,688 --> 00:08:47,075
Vodka martini for Mr. Treadwell
and make it snappy.

156
00:08:47,075 --> 00:08:51,261
Oh, no, that's the one drink
I don't know how to make.

157
00:08:56,833 --> 00:08:59,141
Things seem to be
going very well.

158
00:08:59,141 --> 00:09:01,245
Yeah, just make sure
he gets a napkin.

159
00:09:01,245 --> 00:09:04,396
We only lost about
a thousand points
on that last time.

160
00:09:04,396 --> 00:09:09,228
As if it would have
really killed him
to use the paper towels.

161
00:09:09,263 --> 00:09:11,063
Thank you, Sam.

162
00:09:11,215 --> 00:09:15,834
Here you go, Mr. Treadwell.
Notice the cocktail napkin.

163
00:09:15,869 --> 00:09:19,054
There's plenty more
where that one came from.

164
00:09:20,507 --> 00:09:22,736
Mm, very nice.

165
00:09:22,736 --> 00:09:24,448
Yes, we make
a good martini here.

166
00:09:24,448 --> 00:09:27,071
Oh, that, too.

167
00:09:28,832 --> 00:09:30,766
Very sweet of you.

168
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,680
Do you have any questions
about Cheers?

169
00:09:32,702 --> 00:09:36,689
Actually, I do.
But, unfortunately,
I'm running a little bit late.

170
00:09:36,723 --> 00:09:40,142
Would you, by any chance
be free for dinner tonight?

171
00:09:40,176 --> 00:09:44,233
- Dinner?
- Yes, it's the third meal
of the day.

172
00:09:44,233 --> 00:09:48,217
We could find somewhere
nice and quiet
where we wouldn't be disturbed.

173
00:09:48,251 --> 00:09:49,517
Uh... I don't know.

174
00:09:49,517 --> 00:09:53,072
You know,
the more time
you and I spend together,

175
00:09:53,106 --> 00:09:56,442
the happier I think
you'll be with the review.

176
00:09:56,477 --> 00:09:58,911
Will you excuse me a minute?

177
00:09:58,945 --> 00:10:01,356
I just want
to check my schedule.

178
00:10:07,037 --> 00:10:09,205
He wants me to have
dinner with him.

179
00:10:09,239 --> 00:10:12,442
That means he expects something
for a good review.

180
00:10:12,476 --> 00:10:14,793
I'll get the petty cash.

181
00:10:18,098 --> 00:10:21,667
Sam.
He wants me to
compromise myself.

182
00:10:21,701 --> 00:10:24,017
Honey, we all do.

183
00:10:24,988 --> 00:10:26,956
Why do I even talk to you?

184
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:29,916
I'm not going to make
a big deal of this.
It's just going to be
another business dinner.

185
00:10:29,916 --> 00:10:31,210
That's all.
Everything will be fine.

186
00:10:31,245 --> 00:10:35,343
Listen to me. Listen.
If, uh, one thing should
lead to another tonight

187
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:38,267
and you wake up in the morning
and find out you done something
you wish you hadn't,

188
00:10:38,301 --> 00:10:42,515
I just want you to know,
I'd love to take you
out tomorrow night.

189
00:10:44,774 --> 00:10:47,577
So I stand by
my original review,

190
00:10:47,611 --> 00:10:49,812
"the Hungry Heifer is a trough."

191
00:10:49,846 --> 00:10:52,131
Okay, fine.
But listen, if you can find

192
00:10:52,131 --> 00:10:55,962
a better 25-ounce steak
for $1.99, pal,
you just let me know, all right?

193
00:10:59,536 --> 00:11:01,766
I'd be happy to have
dinner with you tonight.

194
00:11:01,791 --> 00:11:04,410
- Great, I'll pick you up at 7:00.
- Terrific.

195
00:11:04,444 --> 00:11:08,647
- I'll see you then,
Mr. Treadwell.
- Please, call me Murray.

196
00:11:11,509 --> 00:11:13,629
All right, all right,
sure thing, Eddie.

197
00:11:13,654 --> 00:11:16,649
Okay, listen, break a wing.

198
00:11:16,649 --> 00:11:19,957
I know, I know, I know,
you hate those jokes.

199
00:11:19,957 --> 00:11:23,098
Listen, just keep
a stiff upper beak.

200
00:11:23,763 --> 00:11:26,432
I'm sorry.
All right, bye-bye, bye-bye.

201
00:11:26,466 --> 00:11:30,619
Oh, heck.
That was your husband
on the phone there, Carla.

202
00:11:30,654 --> 00:11:33,656
- Why was he calling you?
- Well, he's upset.

203
00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:38,010
He wanted me to ask you,
find out why, you know,
you won't go see him.

204
00:11:38,044 --> 00:11:42,381
How can I, Sam?
I can't afford
a plane ticket to Seattle.

205
00:11:42,416 --> 00:11:43,882
Well, now I could
loan you the money.

206
00:11:43,917 --> 00:11:46,598
Great.
But who could get the time off?

207
00:11:46,598 --> 00:11:49,427
If it's for the sake
of your marriage,
I'm sure we could
work something out.

208
00:11:49,427 --> 00:11:53,267
If you'd like to take
a leave of absence
for say, a year,
that would be fine.

209
00:11:53,267 --> 00:11:57,704
I-I really, I don't know
why everybody thinks
I could just
pick myself up and go.

210
00:11:57,704 --> 00:11:59,348
I got two newborn babies.

211
00:11:59,383 --> 00:12:01,172
Take them. Tykes fly free.

212
00:12:01,172 --> 00:12:03,452
Yeah, usually in the
seat right next to me.

213
00:12:03,487 --> 00:12:06,639
Look, I can't go,
so let's just drop it, okay?

214
00:12:06,673 --> 00:12:09,958
Geez.
Just came up for a drink order.

215
00:12:09,993 --> 00:12:14,038
- Carla, Eddie's afraid that
you're ashamed of him.
- Well, I'm not.

216
00:12:14,038 --> 00:12:17,049
- Well, tell him.
Don't tell me.
- I will!

217
00:12:17,083 --> 00:12:19,702
The minute he gets back.

218
00:12:19,736 --> 00:12:21,850
You're not afraid to fly,
are you, Carla?

219
00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:25,998
Me? Afraid to fly? Me?

220
00:12:37,421 --> 00:12:39,773
Well, it must be something.

221
00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:56,982
I am not afraid to fly.
I'm not!

222
00:12:57,391 --> 00:13:00,642
I'm afraid to crash.

223
00:13:01,012 --> 00:13:04,942
- Did you have
a bad experience...?
- Yes, I did!

224
00:13:05,549 --> 00:13:07,737
First time in an airplane.

225
00:13:07,737 --> 00:13:10,486
It was on my honeymoon
with Nick.

226
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:14,374
We're going to New York...
short flight, no problem, right?

227
00:13:14,408 --> 00:13:17,743
Well, suddenly, the plane
hits turbulence, right?

228
00:13:17,777 --> 00:13:21,247
Me and Nick were thrown
all around that bathroom.

229
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:26,162
I haven't flown since.

230
00:13:26,162 --> 00:13:28,600
Sweetheart, that
was just one time.
I mean, look at me.

231
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:31,624
When I was playing ball,
I must have flown 200,000 miles,

232
00:13:31,658 --> 00:13:33,581
and I don't remember
anything happening.

233
00:13:33,581 --> 00:13:35,756
'Cause you were always drunk.

234
00:13:36,129 --> 00:13:38,363
Damn right.

235
00:13:39,059 --> 00:13:40,432
- Good afternoon.
- Hey.

236
00:13:40,432 --> 00:13:44,437
Oh, hey, Frasier.
Yeah. You're just the man
I'm looking for here.

237
00:13:44,471 --> 00:13:48,240
You looking for my camaraderie,
Sam,
or do you want some
free psychiatric advice?

238
00:13:48,274 --> 00:13:50,535
- Uh... that free thing there.
- Good.

239
00:13:50,535 --> 00:13:54,594
Come on. What do you say, Carla?
Oh, no way, Sam. Uh-uh.

240
00:13:54,594 --> 00:13:57,606
I like my head this size.
Just keep him away from me.

241
00:13:57,606 --> 00:13:59,869
He's the only shrink we know.

242
00:13:59,903 --> 00:14:02,512
Oh, stop, Sam.
You're embarrassing me.

243
00:14:02,512 --> 00:14:04,230
What's the problem?

244
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:08,610
Well, Carla wants to visit
Eddie on the West Coast,
but she's afraid to fly.

245
00:14:08,645 --> 00:14:11,877
Well, do you mean,
by afraid to fly, what?

246
00:14:11,877 --> 00:14:14,917
Um... she's claustrophobic,
agoraphobic, or acrophobic?

247
00:14:14,952 --> 00:14:16,869
Death-o-phobic.

248
00:14:16,904 --> 00:14:21,206
Well, you know, Carla,
I've done a lot
of reading lately
about fear of flying.

249
00:14:21,241 --> 00:14:24,904
I've always wanted
to conduct a workshop
for people with your problem.

250
00:14:24,904 --> 00:14:28,738
I'm sure I could scare up
a few people like you.

251
00:14:28,738 --> 00:14:32,799
Oh, no pun intended.
None noticed, I am sure.

252
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:36,872
No way, Frasier.
I am not going to
wind up in your office,

253
00:14:36,906 --> 00:14:40,209
strapped to some table
with electricity shot
through my head.

254
00:14:40,243 --> 00:14:42,544
Carla, that's not
part of the therapy.

255
00:14:42,579 --> 00:14:44,296
Oh, yeah? What about Diane?

256
00:14:44,296 --> 00:14:49,201
Now, look. I never treated Diane
with any kind
of shock inducement.

257
00:14:49,235 --> 00:14:51,652
Of course, now I wish I had.

258
00:14:53,858 --> 00:14:57,176
No, no. The key to this therapy,

259
00:14:57,210 --> 00:15:00,096
you see, is, uh...
desensitization.

260
00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:02,748
Over a period of sessions,
we slowly break down your fears

261
00:15:02,782 --> 00:15:07,070
until you're ready
to get on a plane.
And, at the end, we all
take an actual flight.

262
00:15:07,104 --> 00:15:09,972
Yeah? Well, fly this, Orville.

263
00:15:11,875 --> 00:15:13,814
- Cheers.
- Hey, Sam.

264
00:15:13,814 --> 00:15:16,912
Oh, hey, Eddie.
Long time no hear. Yeah.
How you doing?

265
00:15:16,912 --> 00:15:20,216
Oh, the show? It's okay.
It's kind
of a hockey players' reunion.

266
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:23,019
Listen.
Did you talk to her, Sam?
I mean, what did she say?

267
00:15:23,053 --> 00:15:26,923
No, listen. The problem, Eddie,
is not that
she's afraid to see you.

268
00:15:26,957 --> 00:15:28,757
It's that she's afraid to fly.

269
00:15:28,792 --> 00:15:32,658
Carla, afraid?
Carla's not afraid
of anything, Sam.

270
00:15:32,743 --> 00:15:36,309
See, that's just an excuse.
I mean, she's ashamed of me.

271
00:15:36,309 --> 00:15:38,991
You know something?
It's just not working.
I'm going to quit.

272
00:15:38,991 --> 00:15:40,226
No, wait. Hold on. Hold on.

273
00:15:40,253 --> 00:15:43,289
Listen, he's so sure
you're ashamed of him
that he wants to quit.

274
00:15:43,323 --> 00:15:45,324
- Really?
- Yes.

275
00:15:45,358 --> 00:15:47,442
Give me this phone.

276
00:15:47,477 --> 00:15:49,526
Eddie?

277
00:15:51,415 --> 00:15:53,466
I'm coming to see you.

278
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:56,369
I'll be there in about a week.

279
00:15:56,403 --> 00:16:00,405
Really? Aw, gee, Carla.
I got the biggest smile
you ever saw on my face.

280
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:02,549
I wish you could see me.

281
00:16:04,844 --> 00:16:06,461
Eddie?

282
00:16:11,568 --> 00:16:14,604
Before we take off,
I'd like to commend you.

283
00:16:14,638 --> 00:16:19,391
It's been an intense week,
but here we are, finally,
at the end of our journey.

284
00:16:19,426 --> 00:16:26,264
Or should I say, perhaps
the beginning of the end
of our journey.

285
00:16:26,299 --> 00:16:29,752
I guess we're all set.
Let's get this show on the road.

286
00:16:29,787 --> 00:16:32,204
Dr. Crane, uh...
I... I hope you don't mind.

287
00:16:32,238 --> 00:16:34,790
I brought along a little
Saint Christopher's medal.

288
00:16:34,825 --> 00:16:36,442
Oh. Well, no.
If that helps you, that's fine.

289
00:16:36,477 --> 00:16:38,480
Oh, great.

290
00:16:39,078 --> 00:16:40,459
Anybody else want one?

291
00:16:40,459 --> 00:16:43,572
Now, now, Carla.
All religious artifacts
must be stored

292
00:16:43,572 --> 00:16:47,156
either below the seat
in front of you
or in the overhead bin.

293
00:16:47,955 --> 00:16:50,455
There, now. Isn't this fun? Huh?

294
00:16:50,490 --> 00:16:55,394
Now...
we're going to take off
in a few minutes,
so what should we all be doing?

295
00:16:55,979 --> 00:16:57,828
People?

296
00:16:58,181 --> 00:17:02,690
Well, we should be focusing
on our happy place.

297
00:17:04,087 --> 00:17:08,624
That place where
we most like to be...
where we're most relaxed.

298
00:17:08,658 --> 00:17:10,443
Can you see it?

299
00:17:10,477 --> 00:17:13,446
Excuse me, sir. We'll
be taking off shortly.
Would you please sit down?

300
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:14,793
Oh, yes, of course.
Just a moment.

301
00:17:14,793 --> 00:17:17,801
All right, now,
you're in your happy place.

302
00:17:17,985 --> 00:17:20,706
You're at peace with the world.

303
00:17:21,238 --> 00:17:25,119
- Oh, God.
- Now, just stay
in your happy place.

304
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:28,551
If it's the beach,
just imagine that that sound

305
00:17:28,551 --> 00:17:31,364
is the gentle rippling
of the water.

306
00:17:31,799 --> 00:17:33,883
Carla,
where's your happy place?

307
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:37,452
On the floor of my stomach,
clutching the earth
with both hands.

308
00:17:37,452 --> 00:17:39,203
Good. Good!

309
00:17:39,203 --> 00:17:41,862
Oh! Uh... Dr. Crane...

310
00:17:41,862 --> 00:17:45,194
I've forgotten
where my happy place is.

311
00:17:45,229 --> 00:17:47,396
- I think yours was in the Berkshires.
- Oh, yes.

312
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:51,229
- Mine is in the Berkshires.
- Look, everybody can be
in the Berkshires if they like.

313
00:17:52,636 --> 00:17:57,006
The Berkshires is an expansive
and wonderful wooded wonderland.

314
00:17:57,006 --> 00:18:01,233
That's going to go up
like a Roman candle
when this baby crashes into it!

315
00:18:01,261 --> 00:18:04,396
Ladies and gentlemen,
we've been cleared for takeoff.

316
00:18:04,431 --> 00:18:08,217
So please, sit back, relax.
Thanks for flying with us.

317
00:18:08,251 --> 00:18:11,388
Did he say, "Thanks
for dying with us"?

318
00:18:11,388 --> 00:18:15,357
Just relax.
I'll be sitting
right here beside you.

319
00:18:15,391 --> 00:18:18,946
If you're a little nervous,
go ahead and grab on to me.

320
00:18:32,059 --> 00:18:35,505
- Afternoon, everybody.
- Norm! Norm! Norm!

321
00:18:35,505 --> 00:18:39,481
- What's the story, Mr. Peterson?
- "Bobbsey Twins
Go to the Brewery."

322
00:18:39,515 --> 00:18:42,015
Let's just cut
to the happy ending.

323
00:18:42,015 --> 00:18:45,671
Uh-oh!
We got the Cheers review today.

324
00:18:45,671 --> 00:18:47,995
Oh, God! Here it comes.

325
00:18:47,995 --> 00:18:51,345
Well, at least you'll all know
I didn't compromise myself.

326
00:18:51,345 --> 00:18:54,636
And that we probably
got a horrendous review
and I'll get fired.

327
00:18:54,636 --> 00:18:59,800
I can still look at
myself in the mirror
and say, "Would it
have killed you?"

328
00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:03,239
"Hurrah, hurrah for Cheers,
the best bar in Boston."

329
00:19:03,273 --> 00:19:07,784
- Oh, you slept with him.
- I did not.

330
00:19:07,784 --> 00:19:11,069
"Warm, inviting, a delight
from top to bottom."

331
00:19:11,069 --> 00:19:13,598
- The bar or you?
- I did not sleep with him.

332
00:19:13,633 --> 00:19:16,668
Oh, stop it. I think I respect
you more now than I ever did.

333
00:19:16,703 --> 00:19:19,479
I did not sleep with him.
You just have a filthy mind.

334
00:19:19,479 --> 00:19:21,907
Nobody else in here thinks
that, so just shut up.

335
00:19:21,942 --> 00:19:23,919
How was he?

336
00:19:26,213 --> 00:19:29,310
I did not sleep with him.

337
00:19:31,751 --> 00:19:33,502
Yeah. Cheers.

338
00:19:33,537 --> 00:19:35,908
As a matter of fact, she is.
Hold on one second.

339
00:19:35,908 --> 00:19:37,506
It's your boss.

340
00:19:37,541 --> 00:19:39,955
Hello.
Mr. Drake.

341
00:19:39,955 --> 00:19:42,961
Did you happen to catch
our remarkable review?

342
00:19:42,996 --> 00:19:45,747
Good? Oh, it was fantastic.

343
00:19:45,782 --> 00:19:48,034
Yes. We're all very proud.

344
00:19:48,068 --> 00:19:50,352
Yeah, well, you know,
we work pretty hard...

345
00:19:50,387 --> 00:19:53,822
No! I did not sleep with him.

346
00:19:58,511 --> 00:20:00,540
Good air in...

347
00:20:01,498 --> 00:20:04,785
and the bad air out.

348
00:20:04,785 --> 00:20:07,786
That's good.
Nice, easy breathing.

349
00:20:07,821 --> 00:20:10,070
Now, there.
Don't you all feel better?

350
00:20:10,674 --> 00:20:13,163
Now, now. Remember
what we learned.

351
00:20:16,146 --> 00:20:18,241
That's just a little kitty cat.

352
00:20:18,241 --> 00:20:22,951
C.A.T. - Clear Air Turbulence.

353
00:20:22,986 --> 00:20:26,009
Now... now that
you're all relaxed,

354
00:20:26,009 --> 00:20:28,448
we can take this opportunity
to, uh... 

355
00:20:28,448 --> 00:20:33,964
well, further discuss
the irrationality of our fears.

356
00:20:34,898 --> 00:20:36,298
Anyone?

357
00:20:36,333 --> 00:20:40,084
I...I... I just wish
I had more control.

358
00:20:40,084 --> 00:20:43,372
I think I'd feel better
if I were flying the plane.

359
00:20:43,407 --> 00:20:45,852
Trust me. That doesn't help.
How do you know?

360
00:20:45,852 --> 00:20:49,311
- I was a pilot for this airline.
- You were?

361
00:20:49,345 --> 00:20:52,983
I was flying
a jumbo jet... full plane...

362
00:20:52,983 --> 00:20:56,166
and it occurred to me that
all these people

363
00:20:56,166 --> 00:20:59,100
 had their lives
in the hands of someone like me.

364
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:01,224
I couldn't go up again.

365
00:21:01,258 --> 00:21:04,677
Forget the pilot!
What about those mechanics, huh?

366
00:21:04,711 --> 00:21:08,108
I mean, what if one of
those guys has a bad day?
Forgets to screw in a lug nut?

367
00:21:08,143 --> 00:21:09,565
Carla, they're
trained technicians.

368
00:21:09,599 --> 00:21:12,756
- Aren't they in a labor dispute?
- Yes, but it's almost over.

369
00:21:12,756 --> 00:21:15,404
Well, what happens
if we get hit by lightning?

370
00:21:15,439 --> 00:21:17,339
Oh, now, I'm sure the plane
is designed to handle that.

371
00:21:17,374 --> 00:21:20,509
Or if a teeny, tiny little bird
gets in the engine?

372
00:21:20,543 --> 00:21:23,362
God! What bird would be flying
at 30,000 feet?

373
00:21:23,396 --> 00:21:25,269
We're at 30,000 feet?

374
00:21:25,269 --> 00:21:27,900
This plane
is too heavy
to be up that high!

375
00:21:27,902 --> 00:21:31,737
If anything happens,
we're all just going
to drop like spit
off the Prudential Building.

376
00:21:31,771 --> 00:21:32,904
Carla, now you're being silly.

377
00:21:32,939 --> 00:21:36,231
- Listen, statistics prove
that this is...
- The hell with statistics.

378
00:21:36,231 --> 00:21:39,978
Does the words
"ice on the wings"
mean anything to you?

379
00:21:40,013 --> 00:21:44,233
Oh, that is simply the sun
glinting off the wings.

380
00:21:44,267 --> 00:21:46,644
Does that look like ice to you?

381
00:21:52,576 --> 00:21:55,852
Will you stop that
incessant caterwauling?

382
00:21:59,266 --> 00:22:01,616
Why aren't they serving drinks?

383
00:22:01,651 --> 00:22:04,887
- Hey, Fras, you okay?
- I'm fine. Fine.

384
00:22:04,921 --> 00:22:08,021
- You look a little green.
- I'm perfectly all right.

385
00:22:08,475 --> 00:22:11,478
Where is that
damn cocktail cart?

386
00:22:13,437 --> 00:22:15,230
What was that? What?

387
00:22:15,265 --> 00:22:17,340
That pinging noise.

388
00:22:17,517 --> 00:22:19,992
I heard it.
I heard a ping, a ping, ping.

389
00:22:19,992 --> 00:22:21,418
What, have you all gone deaf
or something?

390
00:22:21,418 --> 00:22:23,862
Hey, hey, ease up.

391
00:22:24,407 --> 00:22:27,432
- Do you feel cold air
rushing in here?
- No.

392
00:22:27,432 --> 00:22:29,512
My God!
There's a leak in the fuselage!

393
00:22:29,512 --> 00:22:31,067
Calm down, Frasier.

394
00:22:31,067 --> 00:22:33,448
Oh, God, look! It's the wings!

395
00:22:33,483 --> 00:22:35,800
They're flapping
around like a wounded duck!

396
00:22:35,835 --> 00:22:37,112
We're all gonna die!

397
00:22:37,112 --> 00:22:40,439
- Frasier! You're not
in your happy place.
- What do you mean? In a grave?

398
00:22:40,473 --> 00:22:43,802
We're going down!
We're going down!
I got to get out of here!

399
00:22:43,870 --> 00:22:45,799
Mommy!
Mommy!

400
00:22:45,799 --> 00:22:47,336
Frasier!

401
00:22:51,251 --> 00:22:55,003
Honest, Eddie.
I'm flying out
tomorrow night. Yeah.

402
00:22:55,038 --> 00:22:59,908
Frasier's class taught me
how stupid it was
to be afraid of flying.

403
00:22:59,942 --> 00:23:04,146
Oh, me, too.
I can't wait to get you alone,

404
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:08,691
strip you out of that penguin
outfit, and climb all over ya.

405
00:23:08,691 --> 00:23:13,355
We're sharing a room
with the three little pigs?

406
00:23:13,390 --> 00:23:16,994
Well, they're used
to huffing and puffing.

407
00:23:17,294 --> 00:23:19,986
All right. See you then.

408
00:23:19,986 --> 00:23:24,091
Sam, you don't
really think Miss Howe
would do anything she shouldn't
have to get a good review, do you?

409
00:23:24,091 --> 00:23:27,285
No, Of course not. Then why
do you keep teasing her?

410
00:23:27,319 --> 00:23:32,033
Well, haven't you ever noticed
how her chest kind of
heaves when she's angry?

411
00:23:32,541 --> 00:23:35,654
I always avert my eyes.

412
00:23:36,563 --> 00:23:38,897
- You're kidding me.
- No.

413
00:23:38,932 --> 00:23:42,065
I'm a leg man.

414
00:23:44,604 --> 00:23:48,770
Excuse me, miss?
I couldn't help but
overhear your conversation.

415
00:23:48,770 --> 00:23:54,313
I've had a fear
of flying for years,
and I think it's time
that I confronted it.

416
00:23:54,347 --> 00:23:57,700
How can I get into that class
that worked miracles for you?

417
00:23:57,734 --> 00:24:00,424
I can do better than that.
The doctor's over there.

418
00:24:00,424 --> 00:24:04,278
- Hey, Fras?
- I'm in my happy place.

419
00:24:05,708 --> 00:24:07,868
Sign up early.

420
00:24:07,869 --> 00:24:28,869
translate
