1
00:00:00,301 --> 00:00:02,178
{\an8}Mya, super important.

2
00:00:02,261 --> 00:00:05,681
-  Uh-hmm?
- We're voting. Which pic should I post?

3
00:00:05,765 --> 00:00:07,475
The eighth one. For sure.

4
00:00:08,184 --> 00:00:11,103
Look, if she says hi, you say hi.

5
00:00:11,187 --> 00:00:14,482
But no matter what, we keep on walking.

6
00:00:14,565 --> 00:00:15,900
Okay. Yeah, I got it.

7
00:00:15,983 --> 00:00:18,319
- Hey, Rafa.
- Hey, Mya, what's up?

8
00:00:18,402 --> 00:00:20,613
How's it going?
Sure, it was windy out, you look nice.

9
00:00:20,696 --> 00:00:22,240
- Is your day going good?
-  Yeah.

10
00:00:22,323 --> 00:00:26,160
So, I have Running Club tomorrow and
you have your college prep thing, right?

11
00:00:26,244 --> 00:00:28,162
- Think I can get a ride home?
- Yeah.

12
00:00:28,246 --> 00:00:32,250
Yeah, sure. I'm your guy.
Not, well, not your guy.

13
00:00:32,333 --> 00:00:35,044
I'm a guy of guys.

14
00:00:35,127 --> 00:00:38,297
There's guys in the vicinity,
I'm one of them.

15
00:00:38,381 --> 00:00:39,715
That's what I'm saying.

16
00:00:39,799 --> 00:00:41,384
So, the ride?

17
00:00:41,467 --> 00:00:43,344
- Yeah, I can give you a ride.
-  Okay.

18
00:00:43,427 --> 00:00:45,304
- For sure.
- Hey, Mya.

19
00:00:45,388 --> 00:00:47,598
What are you doing later?
Besides hanging out with me?

20
00:00:47,682 --> 00:00:49,559
Literally, anything else.

21
00:00:49,642 --> 00:00:51,143
Why you being like that?

22
00:00:51,227 --> 00:00:53,062
I don't know you and you don't know me.

23
00:00:53,145 --> 00:00:54,730
I'm not going out with some random kid.

24
00:00:54,814 --> 00:00:57,483
I'm not random. I'm Tony.

25
00:00:57,567 --> 00:00:59,652
Okay, cool. So, what's my last name, Tony?

26
00:01:04,865 --> 00:01:05,866
Rudolph?

27
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:07,952
Do you think her name is Mya Rudolph?

28
00:01:08,035 --> 00:01:10,162
- Shut up, Rafa.
- Bye, Tony.

29
00:01:10,246 --> 00:01:11,414
Whatever. You're not that cute.

30
00:01:11,497 --> 00:01:13,374
Neither are you, Jake from State Farm.

31
00:01:15,251 --> 00:01:16,544
Dammit.

32
00:01:22,592 --> 00:01:24,885
You need to rinse those
before you put them in there.

33
00:01:24,969 --> 00:01:25,970
Oh, no, you don't.

34
00:01:26,053 --> 00:01:28,180
Uh, it's a dishwasher, it's right there
in the name of the machine.

35
00:01:28,264 --> 00:01:31,392
If you don't rinse them, the food
particles will clog up the machinery.

36
00:01:31,475 --> 00:01:34,729
So, you want me to wash the dishes
before I put them in the dishwasher?

37
00:01:36,063 --> 00:01:38,649
And do you also wash your body
before you get into a Jacuzzi?

38
00:01:38,733 --> 00:01:40,693
I've never been in a Jacuzzi in my life.

39
00:01:40,776 --> 00:01:42,194
I was gonna wait
until you guys were done arguing,

40
00:01:42,278 --> 00:01:44,071
but I just realized
that that's gonna be never.

41
00:01:44,155 --> 00:01:49,535
So, can I borrow your car
tomorrow just for a little while?

42
00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:51,120
Mya asked me for a ride home.

43
00:01:51,203 --> 00:01:54,081
The 14-year old BMW,
the one that can't go in reverse anymore?

44
00:01:54,165 --> 00:01:58,878
It's still a BMW, idiot.
The epitome of sophistication.

45
00:01:58,961 --> 00:02:00,004
Primo, ask me her name.

46
00:02:00,087 --> 00:02:01,213
Who?

47
00:02:01,297 --> 00:02:02,632
My car.

48
00:02:02,715 --> 00:02:05,009
- I really don't want to.
- Sigourney Beemer.

49
00:02:05,551 --> 00:02:06,552
Okay.

50
00:02:06,636 --> 00:02:09,347
Primo, the best car
in this family is my Econoline.

51
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:11,641
278 cubic feet of storage space.

52
00:02:11,724 --> 00:02:13,809
You could give 15 Myas a ride home.

53
00:02:13,893 --> 00:02:16,687
I just need to give one Mya
a ride home and your work van

54
00:02:16,771 --> 00:02:19,732
is weird and confusing.

55
00:02:19,815 --> 00:02:21,150
How is it confusing?

56
00:02:21,233 --> 00:02:22,943
I don't understand.

57
00:02:23,027 --> 00:02:25,780
I'm Jay Gonzales,
I fix irrigation problems,

58
00:02:25,863 --> 00:02:28,574
and I had this painted right
after the movie  "Gone Girl"  came out.

59
00:02:28,658 --> 00:02:30,284
What's hard to understand about that?

60
00:02:31,452 --> 00:02:32,787
The last part.

61
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:34,622
So, can I borrow Sigourney Beemer?

62
00:02:34,705 --> 00:02:36,874
Yeah. I'd be happy
to escort you and Mya out

63
00:02:36,957 --> 00:02:38,959
as we all experience
the ultimate driving machine.

64
00:02:39,043 --> 00:02:40,503
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

65
00:02:40,586 --> 00:02:43,506
I have a permit. I can drive.
I'll go myself.

66
00:02:43,589 --> 00:02:47,843
Well, yeah, sure thing, Primo.
I'm gonna give you my BMW for the day.

67
00:02:47,927 --> 00:02:49,470
You don't even have driving gloves.

68
00:02:49,553 --> 00:02:50,513
Neither do you.

69
00:02:50,596 --> 00:02:52,640
They're just batting gloves
with the tips cut off.

70
00:02:52,723 --> 00:02:56,102
The point still stands.
No raw palm on the wheel.

71
00:03:01,339 --> 00:03:03,604
Ride Home

72
00:03:08,656 --> 00:03:11,826
Hey, guess how many knives
I have hidden on me right now?

73
00:03:11,909 --> 00:03:13,452
- I don't care.
- Fourteen.

74
00:03:14,578 --> 00:03:16,664
Okay. That's impressive.

75
00:03:16,747 --> 00:03:19,875
Hey. Your brother's in trouble.

76
00:03:19,959 --> 00:03:21,836
Yeah, you're gonna have to be
more specific.

77
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:24,630
That was Mondo's doctor.
He needs to come in right away.

78
00:03:24,714 --> 00:03:27,341
Last week, he broke his toe
using the Slushee machine.

79
00:03:28,175 --> 00:03:29,260
What?

80
00:03:29,343 --> 00:03:31,929
- Hey, Mondo.
- Hey.

81
00:03:34,598 --> 00:03:36,142
Uh-uh. What are you doing?

82
00:03:36,225 --> 00:03:39,311
My sandals broke. The ground is hot.
Don't worry, I'll pay for it.

83
00:03:39,395 --> 00:03:41,147
That's not the part that's the problem.

84
00:03:42,773 --> 00:03:46,694
While he was there, they ran some tests
and something bad came up.

85
00:03:46,777 --> 00:03:49,280
They'll only tell Mondo,
but obviously it's important.

86
00:03:49,363 --> 00:03:52,158
- So you guys need to go find him.
- He'll be fine.
It's just a toe.

87
00:03:52,241 --> 00:03:55,745
A doctor doesn't call on a Saturday
and say, "We need to see you immediately.

88
00:03:55,828 --> 00:03:58,122
It's because of your toe."
He's in trouble.

89
00:03:58,205 --> 00:04:01,208
Now they won't tell me anything
over the phone,
so I'm gonna go down there.

90
00:04:01,292 --> 00:04:03,294
What are they gonna tell you
in person that they're not

91
00:04:03,377 --> 00:04:05,129
- telling you over the phone?
- A lot.

92
00:04:05,212 --> 00:04:08,048
You two, go to the flea market,
see if he's there selling his art.

93
00:04:09,842 --> 00:04:13,179
Fine. Come on.
He needs to get his phone turned back on.

94
00:04:15,556 --> 00:04:17,516
Did you just stab yourself
with one of your secret knives?

95
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,934
A lot of them.

96
00:04:21,103 --> 00:04:24,106
Feel how supple that leather is?
Merino.

97
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:26,776
It's named after the breed of sheep
the leather is harvested from.

98
00:04:26,859 --> 00:04:29,320
Good for us, bad for the sheep, right?

99
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:31,447
- Huh.
-  Hey, listen.

100
00:04:33,032 --> 00:04:36,243
So, I'm trying to get to know Mya better.

101
00:04:36,327 --> 00:04:39,205
So I was thinking,
is it cool if you play my playlist

102
00:04:39,288 --> 00:04:41,207
and she and I sit in the back
so we can talk,

103
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:43,834
and you kind of, you don't ever talk?

104
00:04:43,918 --> 00:04:45,377
Like an Uber driver?

105
00:04:46,378 --> 00:04:49,465
More like Ryan Gosling in Drive.

106
00:04:49,548 --> 00:04:51,383
Just looking super cool and mysterious.

107
00:04:51,467 --> 00:04:52,927
Uh-huh. Yeah.

108
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:54,261
And you just don't ever talk.

109
00:04:54,345 --> 00:04:57,181
- Yeah.
- You just don't ever...

110
00:04:57,264 --> 00:04:58,390
- Ever.
- Talk.

111
00:04:58,474 --> 00:05:00,476
Talk. Yeah, you got it. You're right.

112
00:05:01,644 --> 00:05:03,437
Also, you should think
about wearing cologne.

113
00:05:03,521 --> 00:05:05,064
Yeah, women are very old factory.

114
00:05:05,147 --> 00:05:06,148
Really?

115
00:05:06,232 --> 00:05:09,068
Yeah. That's why I keep a baggie
of free samples right there at the door.

116
00:05:09,151 --> 00:05:10,319
Check it out.

117
00:05:13,197 --> 00:05:15,324
"Elon's Musk" by Elon Musk?

118
00:05:15,407 --> 00:05:16,742
Yeah, it's about time.

119
00:05:16,826 --> 00:05:18,911
"Plot Twist" by M. Night Shyamalan?

120
00:05:18,994 --> 00:05:20,287
Yeah, it's just water.

121
00:05:20,996 --> 00:05:25,292
"Pesky" by Leguizamo?
When You Are The One Man Show.

122
00:05:25,376 --> 00:05:26,836
That's the one. Yeah.

123
00:05:26,919 --> 00:05:30,005
I'm telling you, Primo, Ryan doesn't
know crap about relationships.

124
00:05:30,089 --> 00:05:31,715
He's single and free to date
anybody he wants,

125
00:05:31,799 --> 00:05:33,217
does that seem like a good life to you?

126
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:34,552
I mean, yeah.

127
00:05:34,635 --> 00:05:35,845
So sad.

128
00:05:35,928 --> 00:05:37,763
You know he met
his soulmate in high school,

129
00:05:37,847 --> 00:05:39,515
got married right away,

130
00:05:39,598 --> 00:05:43,561
and now has two loving children
that make him breakfast on Father's Day.

131
00:05:43,644 --> 00:05:46,355
Barf. What a nightmare, right?

132
00:05:46,438 --> 00:05:49,441
I mean, no, not really.

133
00:05:52,236 --> 00:05:55,197
Drea, no. You cannot see Mondo's chart.
It's confidential.

134
00:05:55,281 --> 00:05:58,409
Really, Gloria? Really?

135
00:06:00,119 --> 00:06:03,914
Girl, you'll never guess
who has three months to live.

136
00:06:06,208 --> 00:06:07,293
All right.

137
00:06:08,669 --> 00:06:11,130
Check this out.
It's Britney Spears for Petco.

138
00:06:11,213 --> 00:06:14,633
Technically, it's for holding tiny dogs,
but it works well as an everyday purse.

139
00:06:16,302 --> 00:06:18,053
Okay, you have two minutes.

140
00:06:18,137 --> 00:06:21,974
If you want a copy,
I'm gonna need the matching wallet.

141
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:25,352
It's not a wallet,
it's a poop bag dispenser,

142
00:06:25,436 --> 00:06:27,229
but you have yourself a deal.

143
00:06:28,397 --> 00:06:30,900
I cannot believe this is
how Mondo spends his time,

144
00:06:30,983 --> 00:06:32,651
carving disgusting nude sculptures.

145
00:06:33,319 --> 00:06:34,820
They're not disgusting.

146
00:06:34,904 --> 00:06:39,408
They're erotic explorations
of the human form.

147
00:06:39,491 --> 00:06:41,869
Bro, you are so creepy.

148
00:06:41,952 --> 00:06:45,789
And this is just two ...
... each other.

149
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:48,542
Hey, where's Mondo?
We need to talk to him.

150
00:06:48,626 --> 00:06:52,671
I haven't seen him all morning.
He's probably still up in the woods.

151
00:06:52,755 --> 00:06:54,089
Did he send you to cover for him?

152
00:06:54,173 --> 00:06:56,091
No. I'm not selling
your wood porn to people.

153
00:07:01,513 --> 00:07:03,849
-   Hey.
- Hey, you got Mondo?

154
00:07:03,933 --> 00:07:06,209
No. Raul thinks he's still in the woods.

155
00:07:06,209 --> 00:07:08,354
Stop. Seriously.

156
00:07:08,354 --> 00:07:10,522
I am serious. It's his heart.

157
00:07:10,606 --> 00:07:13,400
He had an irregular cardiogram.
They need him to do more tests.

158
00:07:13,484 --> 00:07:15,110
Go to the woods and find him.

159
00:07:15,194 --> 00:07:17,529
You... Stop!

160
00:07:17,613 --> 00:07:21,033
Thanks for the ride again.
So, which uncle's picking up?

161
00:07:21,116 --> 00:07:24,536
Wait, is it Rollie?
Can three of us fit on a motorcycle?

162
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:28,082
No. Uncle Ryan.
He's got a BMW, though, so...

163
00:07:28,165 --> 00:07:31,043
- Oh.
- Pretty cool.
Yeah.

164
00:07:31,126 --> 00:07:33,921
It's the ultimate automobile,
you know, because of the sheep.

165
00:07:36,966 --> 00:07:39,760
- Oh, my God.
- What?

166
00:07:39,843 --> 00:07:41,261
Hey, hop in.

167
00:07:42,513 --> 00:07:44,515
I don't think that's a BMW, man.

168
00:07:49,353 --> 00:07:50,688
What are you doing?

169
00:07:50,771 --> 00:07:53,440
- Where's Uncle Ryan?
- Ryan flaked.
You can't count on him.

170
00:07:53,524 --> 00:07:55,567
I told you,
I'm your guy for stuff like this.

171
00:07:55,651 --> 00:07:57,027
Hey, Mya, grab a seat.

172
00:08:01,782 --> 00:08:03,450
What's that smell?

173
00:08:03,534 --> 00:08:05,869
Oh, that's probably the manure.

174
00:08:05,953 --> 00:08:07,037
Probably?

175
00:08:08,872 --> 00:08:11,041
Don't worry. I got you.

176
00:08:15,129 --> 00:08:18,090
Yeah. That'll do it.

177
00:08:18,173 --> 00:08:19,299
Buckle up.

178
00:08:23,804 --> 00:08:26,015
Uh, there's no buckle.

179
00:08:26,098 --> 00:08:29,101
Oh, that's right.
Don't worry. I'm a good driver.

180
00:08:29,184 --> 00:08:32,104
You look like a baby G.I. Joe.

181
00:08:33,397 --> 00:08:35,441
Shut up. It's a search and rescue mission.

182
00:08:35,524 --> 00:08:37,901
We're looking for our brother,
not Bin Laden, bro.

183
00:08:37,985 --> 00:08:39,987
You can never be over-prepared.

184
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:42,990
You don't know what's in these woods.
Mother Nature is cruel.

185
00:08:43,073 --> 00:08:44,825
This gear, I'm ready for anything.

186
00:08:44,908 --> 00:08:47,453
I am able to fend off predators,
large and small.

187
00:08:50,456 --> 00:08:51,457
What the hell?

188
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:53,208
You're lucky I could come.

189
00:08:53,292 --> 00:08:55,961
I'm on a worksite right now,
I had to take 20 to come get you.

190
00:08:56,045 --> 00:08:58,464
Perks of being the boss.

191
00:08:58,547 --> 00:09:01,216
My dad had a van been like this
when he was stationed in Nashville.

192
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:03,052
His funk band used it for their equipment.

193
00:09:03,135 --> 00:09:05,262
Music. Let's talk about music.

194
00:09:07,473 --> 00:09:09,475
There's no Bluetooth in here, is there?

195
00:09:09,558 --> 00:09:11,685
Only if you're talking about
my dead molar.

196
00:09:12,895 --> 00:09:17,983
I'm not.
Um, I made a playlist for our ride.

197
00:09:18,067 --> 00:09:19,193
Do you like Bad Bunny?

198
00:09:19,276 --> 00:09:21,028
He rode on top of a truck
into WrestleMania.

199
00:09:21,111 --> 00:09:22,571
Hmm, my brother loves him.

200
00:09:22,654 --> 00:09:25,115
All the music I listen to
is stuff I picked up overseas.

201
00:09:25,199 --> 00:09:26,533
Ooh, do you have any Pferdekamf?

202
00:09:27,159 --> 00:09:28,285
They're German Death Metal.

203
00:09:28,368 --> 00:09:30,370
I really got into them
when we lived in Berlin.

204
00:09:30,454 --> 00:09:34,291
Um, doesn't look like
Pferdekampf is on Spotify.

205
00:09:34,374 --> 00:09:35,918
Oh, yeah, that's right.
They got perma-banned

206
00:09:36,001 --> 00:09:38,087
because all those horses
died at their concerts.

207
00:09:38,170 --> 00:09:39,630
Oh, no.

208
00:09:39,713 --> 00:09:41,423
So you have a landscaping business.

209
00:09:41,507 --> 00:09:43,550
I cut yards one summer
when we lived in Ohio.

210
00:09:43,634 --> 00:09:45,928
More irrigation, but we kind of do it all.

211
00:09:46,011 --> 00:09:48,722
I started it 15 years ago
right after I met my wife.

212
00:09:48,806 --> 00:09:49,765
We run it together.

213
00:09:49,848 --> 00:09:52,351
She handles the bookkeeping
and business side of things.

214
00:09:53,435 --> 00:09:54,978
Everything I do is for her.

215
00:09:55,062 --> 00:09:57,106
Aww.

216
00:09:58,524 --> 00:10:00,317
She took a chance on me.

217
00:10:02,319 --> 00:10:03,737
She's beautiful.

218
00:10:05,155 --> 00:10:08,659
Could have had any man she wanted.
And she chose me.

219
00:10:08,742 --> 00:10:10,369
Are you about to cry?

220
00:10:10,452 --> 00:10:11,954
Yes.

221
00:10:14,206 --> 00:10:15,791
I'm about to cry.

222
00:10:26,176 --> 00:10:29,179
- So, thanks for the ride home.
- No problem.

223
00:10:29,263 --> 00:10:31,765
Um, let me know if you're ever
looking for extra cash.

224
00:10:31,849 --> 00:10:32,766
I always need bodies.

225
00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:34,059
I like cash.

226
00:10:34,143 --> 00:10:36,019
We have a project going on right now.

227
00:10:36,103 --> 00:10:38,564
You wanna come do a couple of hours,
see if it's for you?

228
00:10:38,647 --> 00:10:41,817
Sure. I got to get settled in.
Come pick me up in half an hour?

229
00:10:43,277 --> 00:10:45,487
- Okay. Bye.
- Bye.

230
00:10:52,703 --> 00:10:55,956
Hey, there he is. I'm so sorry, man.

231
00:10:56,039 --> 00:10:57,875
I cannot believe this.

232
00:10:57,958 --> 00:11:01,795
There are supposed to be Bluetooth
and seats for everyone, and no manure.

233
00:11:01,879 --> 00:11:04,256
All you had to do was show up.
What happened?

234
00:11:04,339 --> 00:11:06,008
Corporate politics.

235
00:11:06,884 --> 00:11:08,510
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

236
00:11:08,594 --> 00:11:11,013
It's Saturday.
I'm sort of the manager.

237
00:11:11,096 --> 00:11:13,724
I've been specifically told
you are not, Mr. Gonzales.

238
00:11:13,807 --> 00:11:15,684
How'd it go? Did the cologne work?

239
00:11:15,767 --> 00:11:17,644
How'd it go? Terrible.

240
00:11:17,728 --> 00:11:19,646
- And now Mya works for Uncle Jay.
- What?

241
00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:22,191
I don't know what you're
complaining about. Come work too.

242
00:11:22,274 --> 00:11:24,193
You'll be in the same place
for three hours.

243
00:11:24,276 --> 00:11:26,320
Show her you're a good provider.

244
00:11:27,112 --> 00:11:29,489
I met your Aunt Denise at a worksite.

245
00:11:29,573 --> 00:11:32,910
This could be the first chapter
of a long and happy marriage.

246
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:36,038
Let's go,
and grab some garbage bags.

247
00:11:36,121 --> 00:11:38,916
There's a bunch of dead squirrels
we gotta get rid of at the job site.

248
00:11:38,999 --> 00:11:39,958
- What?
- Hey.

249
00:11:40,042 --> 00:11:43,045
Jay screwed this up, but you could
still impress her, okay?

250
00:11:43,128 --> 00:11:45,589
So, let's just come up
with a good first date.

251
00:11:45,672 --> 00:11:47,424
I'll go get the car from the impound lot.

252
00:11:47,507 --> 00:11:50,010
You get some more pesky samples
from the magazines at CVS.

253
00:11:50,093 --> 00:11:51,386
- We'll rendezvous...
- No.

254
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:53,972
You blew it. Thanks to you,

255
00:11:54,056 --> 00:11:56,141
my only chance to impress
the girl that I like

256
00:11:56,225 --> 00:11:57,851
somehow involves manual labor

257
00:11:57,935 --> 00:11:59,728
and bagging squirrel skeletons.

258
00:12:01,939 --> 00:12:03,982
And that's two of my worst things.

259
00:12:05,525 --> 00:12:06,735
What are the odds?

260
00:12:07,569 --> 00:12:11,448
Okay. You can help Ernesto
finish the trench for the main line.

261
00:12:11,531 --> 00:12:13,575
I don't know who Ernesto is
but you got it.

262
00:12:14,409 --> 00:12:15,702
You're getting to know her?

263
00:12:15,786 --> 00:12:17,788
Yeah, I guess.

264
00:12:17,871 --> 00:12:21,667
She got into weird music in Germany,
uh, her dad plays bass,

265
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:24,753
and she's indifferent to the smell
of John Leguizamo.

266
00:12:24,836 --> 00:12:27,839
Well, now you have more time.
Trust me.

267
00:12:27,923 --> 00:12:29,508
This is the way to Mya's heart.

268
00:12:31,677 --> 00:12:33,387
It is hot out here.

269
00:12:34,179 --> 00:12:37,015
Do you have any lemonade,
or like, a gazebo?

270
00:12:39,017 --> 00:12:40,227
Primo...

271
00:12:41,186 --> 00:12:43,855
...don't say any of those words
to these guys.

272
00:12:48,026 --> 00:12:49,152
Hey.

273
00:12:50,028 --> 00:12:52,489
Mondo, where the hell have you been?

274
00:12:55,117 --> 00:12:56,118
Here.

275
00:12:56,201 --> 00:12:58,662
Okay. Your doctor called.
We need to get your heart checked.

276
00:12:58,745 --> 00:13:00,414
- Let's go.
- I'm sure it's fine.

277
00:13:00,497 --> 00:13:01,832
The universe will take care of me.

278
00:13:01,915 --> 00:13:05,002
Yeah. I'm the universe. That's me.
I'm here to take care of you.

279
00:13:06,628 --> 00:13:08,630
- Who are you calling?
- Mike and Rollie.

280
00:13:08,714 --> 00:13:10,465
I sent them to the woods to look for you.

281
00:13:10,549 --> 00:13:12,301
- They're in the woods now?
- Uh-hmm.

282
00:13:12,384 --> 00:13:15,262
The Air Force does weapons training
out there on Saturday afternoons.

283
00:13:15,345 --> 00:13:16,763
Lot of stray bullets.

284
00:13:16,847 --> 00:13:18,265
This is Mike.
I'm on a mission. Do you mind...

285
00:13:18,348 --> 00:13:21,893
Keeping you baboons alive
is a full time job. Let's go.

286
00:13:24,396 --> 00:13:26,732
Hey, so then he like hopped on
like a little scooter

287
00:13:26,815 --> 00:13:29,985
and he scooted off,
so I never saw his full face,

288
00:13:30,068 --> 00:13:32,654
but I'm like 90% sure
it was Morgan Freeman.

289
00:13:32,738 --> 00:13:34,865
Morgan Freeman
has never been on a scooter.

290
00:13:36,283 --> 00:13:38,744
Why are you wearing
those night vision goggles?

291
00:13:38,827 --> 00:13:40,746
Never know when you might need them.

292
00:13:40,829 --> 00:13:43,290
Night. You need them at night.

293
00:13:43,373 --> 00:13:45,167
How did you survive the military?

294
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:46,376
How?

295
00:13:47,210 --> 00:13:51,298
'Cause I'm strong,
and disciplined, and handsome.

296
00:13:51,381 --> 00:13:54,634
I did eighty-mile treks in country
with a hundred-pound pack.

297
00:13:55,594 --> 00:13:57,429
The lowest BPM in my unit.

298
00:13:57,512 --> 00:14:00,724
Look, just because you did a nature walk
and did a couple of Zumba classes,

299
00:14:00,807 --> 00:14:02,100
doesn't mean you're strong.

300
00:14:02,184 --> 00:14:03,560
You might be bigger,

301
00:14:03,643 --> 00:14:06,313
I am stronger, pound-for-pound.

302
00:14:06,396 --> 00:14:09,941
Oh...
...like how an ant can carry a cracker?

303
00:14:10,609 --> 00:14:13,070
That's it. We're going.

304
00:14:13,153 --> 00:14:14,529
- Let's go.
- Okay.

305
00:14:17,115 --> 00:14:18,825
Uh-huh.

306
00:14:24,373 --> 00:14:26,333
- You need help? You good?
-  No, I'm good.

307
00:14:26,416 --> 00:14:29,211
Let me concentrate. I have to
take these off in a very specific order.

308
00:14:31,213 --> 00:14:33,423
All done laying down the PVC pipe.

309
00:14:33,507 --> 00:14:34,466
- Already?
- Uh-hmm.

310
00:14:34,549 --> 00:14:37,094
Took Ernesto two hours
to do that yesterday.

311
00:14:37,177 --> 00:14:38,678
I might have to let him go.

312
00:14:40,097 --> 00:14:42,849
Well, I figured if you put the T-joints
and the elbows into buckets,

313
00:14:42,933 --> 00:14:44,726
you won't have to dig through
them when you need one.

314
00:14:44,810 --> 00:14:46,478
This is going to change everything.

315
00:14:46,561 --> 00:14:49,815
How has no one figured this out?
Mya's the MVP today.

316
00:14:51,817 --> 00:14:53,235
Why don't you work with Rafa a bit?

317
00:14:53,318 --> 00:14:54,319
Okay.

318
00:14:55,028 --> 00:14:57,280
Hey, I have a question for you. So...

319
00:14:57,364 --> 00:15:00,992
...if you could visit any city
and also have any superpower,

320
00:15:01,076 --> 00:15:03,578
and have a dinner party
and invite three famous people,

321
00:15:03,662 --> 00:15:05,038
where would you go,

322
00:15:05,122 --> 00:15:07,666
what superpower would you have,
and who would you invite?

323
00:15:07,749 --> 00:15:09,960
Whoa. Uh, that's a lot.

324
00:15:10,043 --> 00:15:12,587
How about I get back to you
in like, in a month?

325
00:15:13,255 --> 00:15:16,091
My bad.

326
00:15:16,174 --> 00:15:18,760
I, I just figured we'd make
small talk, you know?

327
00:15:18,844 --> 00:15:20,470
Two workers on a job...

328
00:15:21,638 --> 00:15:25,308
...plowing the rich San Antonio soil,
getting to know each other.

329
00:15:26,393 --> 00:15:27,394
Yeah, I'm sorry.

330
00:15:27,477 --> 00:15:29,980
I just don't take a lot of time
to get to know people, you know,

331
00:15:30,063 --> 00:15:31,231
since we move so much.

332
00:15:31,314 --> 00:15:34,192
Oh. That's why you didn't go out
with State Farm Tony.

333
00:15:34,276 --> 00:15:36,445
See, I just thought you
were more of a Geico girl.

334
00:15:36,528 --> 00:15:37,737
Hmm.

335
00:15:37,821 --> 00:15:40,740
Ah! Ah, I think I got stung by a hornet.

336
00:15:42,451 --> 00:15:43,535
Oh.

337
00:15:44,828 --> 00:15:46,580
No, it's just a splinter.

338
00:15:46,663 --> 00:15:49,249
I gotta pinch it out. Hold on.

339
00:15:53,837 --> 00:15:54,880
Got it.

340
00:15:56,298 --> 00:15:57,841
Oh, man. Are you okay?

341
00:15:57,924 --> 00:15:59,301
I'm great.

342
00:15:59,384 --> 00:16:02,053
No, your nose. Your nose is...

343
00:16:04,389 --> 00:16:05,682
Oh.

344
00:16:05,765 --> 00:16:09,102
His little nose is bleeding.

345
00:16:09,186 --> 00:16:10,979
Who's bleeding? Primo, are you bleeding?

346
00:16:11,062 --> 00:16:13,148
No, I'm fine. My sinuses are just dry.

347
00:16:13,231 --> 00:16:14,608
Put your head back, little bleeder.

348
00:16:14,691 --> 00:16:17,277
Please, call me literally anything else.

349
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,612
I'm fine. I just need...

350
00:16:18,695 --> 00:16:19,988
- Oh.

351
00:16:23,033 --> 00:16:24,618
That's it.

352
00:16:24,701 --> 00:16:26,328
- You're in the dirt now.
-  What are you doing?

353
00:16:28,997 --> 00:16:30,207
Strongest brother.

354
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:31,833
- Boo... Oh!

355
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:35,378
That's not good. Oof.

356
00:16:37,297 --> 00:16:38,548
Rollie?

357
00:16:41,468 --> 00:16:43,178
Yeah, that's not good either.

358
00:16:45,931 --> 00:16:47,641
Oh, boy. None of this is good.

359
00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:50,602
All right. There you go.

360
00:16:50,685 --> 00:16:53,605
Those are heavy flow,
so you'll be fine for a few hours.

361
00:16:54,731 --> 00:16:56,900
Please just kill me, Aunt Denise.

362
00:16:56,983 --> 00:16:58,485
Just let me bleed out.

363
00:16:58,568 --> 00:17:04,157
Bad news. You're gonna make it.
I'm off to check on the other site.

364
00:17:04,241 --> 00:17:06,326
Don't make my nephew bleed any more.

365
00:17:08,245 --> 00:17:10,372
Come on. It's not so bad.

366
00:17:10,455 --> 00:17:12,415
You're covered in blood
and sweat and dirt.

367
00:17:12,499 --> 00:17:14,668
It's very manly. You're like a gladiator.

368
00:17:16,169 --> 00:17:17,128
What are you doing?

369
00:17:17,212 --> 00:17:19,339
Jay told me to get the hose
to clean you off.

370
00:17:19,422 --> 00:17:21,341
I'm good. Please don't.

371
00:17:26,596 --> 00:17:29,558
Good pressure on this.
It's like I'm power washing you.

372
00:17:29,641 --> 00:17:32,185
Yeah. I'm going home.

373
00:17:33,353 --> 00:17:38,483
Oh, the tampons are absorbing the water.
Oh, my God. They're expanding.

374
00:17:48,994 --> 00:17:51,705
Primo, great news.

375
00:17:51,788 --> 00:17:54,416
Sigourney's back, safe and sound,

376
00:17:54,499 --> 00:17:57,544
ready to drive, mostly forward.

377
00:17:57,627 --> 00:17:59,754
Hey, you look like hell.

378
00:17:59,838 --> 00:18:03,258
Well, that's what you get
when you listen to Jay about women.

379
00:18:03,341 --> 00:18:07,721
Oh, I got this Jose Canseco
Conceal-and-Contour Kit.

380
00:18:07,804 --> 00:18:11,516
It's just like A-Rod's makeup for men
but not as oily.

381
00:18:12,309 --> 00:18:14,811
Hey, you can't just walk off the site.

382
00:18:14,894 --> 00:18:17,147
You left my crew
and your little girlfriend hanging.

383
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:18,690
Hey, nice of you to show up.

384
00:18:18,773 --> 00:18:21,109
Are you just trying to find new ways
to ruin this kid's life?

385
00:18:21,192 --> 00:18:22,569
You're both ruining my life.

386
00:18:23,361 --> 00:18:25,530
Can you all do me a favor?

387
00:18:25,614 --> 00:18:29,784
Can you please just not talk to me
for like a hundred years?

388
00:18:31,536 --> 00:18:33,705
That'd be great. Thanks.

389
00:18:34,873 --> 00:18:37,334
Oh, you weren't here
when I said this before,

390
00:18:37,417 --> 00:18:40,503
Sigourney's back, totally safe.

391
00:18:43,256 --> 00:18:45,467
- Hey, you okay, man?

392
00:18:50,263 --> 00:18:52,015
- I'm not sure.
- Well...

393
00:18:52,724 --> 00:18:54,559
...I won. Strongest brother.

394
00:18:55,393 --> 00:18:58,772
Uh, also, I separated my shoulder,
and you have a concussion,

395
00:18:58,855 --> 00:19:01,691
and I am pretty sure
I hear gunshots in the distance.

396
00:19:03,193 --> 00:19:05,528
Yup. Right again.

397
00:19:06,821 --> 00:19:09,574
Okay. I gotta get us out of here.

398
00:19:09,658 --> 00:19:13,495
Do not worry.
I trained for this exact situation.

399
00:19:13,578 --> 00:19:17,499
You just listen to everything I say
and we will make it home safe.

400
00:19:17,582 --> 00:19:18,833
Come on.

401
00:19:18,917 --> 00:19:20,251
- Both hands.

402
00:19:20,335 --> 00:19:23,546
Oh. Oh, no.
Never mind. We're gonna die.

403
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:25,674
No.

404
00:19:28,885 --> 00:19:30,679
Oh, thank God.

405
00:19:30,762 --> 00:19:31,763
Mondo?

406
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,058
Andrea, we found him.

407
00:19:35,141 --> 00:19:38,311
Come on, dopes.
Let's get Mondo to the doctor.

408
00:19:40,105 --> 00:19:41,856
I don't think they're okay.

409
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:46,444
Okay. Let's get all of you to the doctor.

410
00:19:56,329 --> 00:19:58,665
Why couldn't you be my uncle?

411
00:19:59,999 --> 00:20:01,418
Family.

412
00:20:03,461 --> 00:20:07,048
Don't be upset. This will be a great story
to tell at your wedding.

413
00:20:08,466 --> 00:20:12,721
Uncle Jay,
this is exactly what I'm talking about.

414
00:20:12,804 --> 00:20:17,684
You're going on about marriage and kids
and proving myself as a provider.

415
00:20:17,767 --> 00:20:20,645
All I wanted was 15 minutes
with the girl that I like.

416
00:20:20,729 --> 00:20:24,315
I'm in high school.
My mom still leaves notes in my lunch.

417
00:20:24,399 --> 00:20:26,651
She leaves notes
in all of our lunches, Primo.

418
00:20:26,735 --> 00:20:28,278
She's a very considerate person.

419
00:20:28,903 --> 00:20:31,281
Look, you got Rollie
for the tough guy stuff,

420
00:20:31,364 --> 00:20:34,951
you got Mondo for the weirdo stuff,
you got Mike to borrow clothes.

421
00:20:35,034 --> 00:20:36,077
'Cause he's the same size.

422
00:20:36,161 --> 00:20:37,620
I know, but...

423
00:20:39,789 --> 00:20:42,500
...when you went to Ryan
for help with Mya...

424
00:20:43,752 --> 00:20:46,629
...I'm like,
"Why wouldn't you come to me?"

425
00:20:47,505 --> 00:20:49,966
I wanna help you. I know things.

426
00:20:51,259 --> 00:20:54,846
My life's pretty good.
I want your life to be good too.

427
00:20:58,808 --> 00:21:00,602
I see what you have,

428
00:21:01,478 --> 00:21:05,398
and one day,
I will be thinking about a wife and kids

429
00:21:05,482 --> 00:21:10,236
and a job that I like,
one that I can do indoors with no shovels.

430
00:21:11,196 --> 00:21:16,159
And when that day comes,
you have my word, I'll come to you.

431
00:21:17,827 --> 00:21:18,828
Deal.

432
00:21:19,829 --> 00:21:20,955
Ryan!

433
00:21:21,706 --> 00:21:23,416
This is a full day's pay,

434
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,376
even though you only worked for an hour.

435
00:21:26,586 --> 00:21:28,087
- What's up?
- Give him your keys.

436
00:21:28,171 --> 00:21:30,131
- What?
- You messed up too.

437
00:21:30,215 --> 00:21:32,342
Give him the keys
so he can take Mya for a ride.

438
00:21:32,425 --> 00:21:35,303
Primo, treat her with gentle hands.

439
00:21:36,429 --> 00:21:39,766
The car, Sigourney Beemer,
treat her with gentle hands,

440
00:21:39,849 --> 00:21:41,601
gentle gloved hands.

441
00:21:47,106 --> 00:21:49,651
- You can put your shirt back on now.
- I know...

442
00:21:49,734 --> 00:21:51,903
...but clothes are merely
a societal construct

443
00:21:51,986 --> 00:21:54,697
and an institutional mechanism
of oppression for your skin.

444
00:21:54,781 --> 00:21:55,824
Did you lose your shirt?

445
00:21:55,907 --> 00:21:56,950
I did.

446
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:01,788
Use this.

447
00:22:03,456 --> 00:22:06,709
All cleaned up.
Now time for the tetanus shot.

448
00:22:06,793 --> 00:22:08,753
Yeah, I don't think I need that. I'm good.

449
00:22:08,837 --> 00:22:09,838
It was a rusty post.

450
00:22:09,921 --> 00:22:12,298
Tetanus is serious.
It can cause lockjaw and spasms.

451
00:22:12,382 --> 00:22:13,800
I'll just drink some hydrogen peroxide.

452
00:22:13,883 --> 00:22:14,968
Don't do that. You'll die.

453
00:22:15,051 --> 00:22:17,053
Hey, no, no, really,
like I don't need the shot.

454
00:22:18,221 --> 00:22:19,806
Hey, are you really a doctor?

455
00:22:19,889 --> 00:22:21,975
Because, legally,
you gotta tell me if you are.

456
00:22:22,058 --> 00:22:25,937
That's cops. And it's an urban myth.
And, yes, I'm a doctor. Please hold still.

457
00:22:28,731 --> 00:22:30,817
And Mondo's test results are here.

458
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:34,445
EKG is all clear.
First one must have been a false reading.

459
00:22:34,529 --> 00:22:37,740
Hmm, the universe is taking care of me.
All is well.

460
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:40,535
Well, actually, no, all is not well,

461
00:22:40,618 --> 00:22:42,996
because the universe
has also given you hepatitis B.

462
00:22:43,079 --> 00:22:45,290
Hmm, that's the chill one. I'm fine.

463
00:22:45,373 --> 00:22:47,250
- And scurvy.
- Got it.

464
00:22:47,333 --> 00:22:48,376
You do got it.

465
00:22:48,459 --> 00:22:50,545
You also have a virus
that's only found in sharks

466
00:22:50,628 --> 00:22:52,964
and you have a shark tooth
embedded in your thigh.

467
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:58,052
So, I have to ask,
have you been intimate with a shark?

468
00:23:01,097 --> 00:23:02,181
I don't think so.

469
00:23:03,266 --> 00:23:04,267
You don't think so?

470
00:23:11,232 --> 00:23:13,651
You're a very safe driver.

471
00:23:13,735 --> 00:23:15,612
I can take it up to 10 if you want.

472
00:23:17,822 --> 00:23:19,908
The city is Boise.

473
00:23:19,991 --> 00:23:22,660
My superpower is teleportation.

474
00:23:22,744 --> 00:23:28,374
The dinner guests are Rihanna,
Zendaya, and Jada Pinkett Smith.

475
00:23:30,293 --> 00:23:33,129
I thought about it.
Those are my answers.

476
00:23:37,550 --> 00:23:38,676
Boise?

477
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:40,803
It's a great ski town, okay?

478
00:23:40,887 --> 00:23:42,013
You ski?

479
00:23:42,096 --> 00:23:43,848
Never tried but I want to.

480
00:23:43,932 --> 00:23:45,350
See, I don't want to.

481
00:23:45,433 --> 00:23:47,977
It just seems like
a really expensive way to fall down.

482
00:23:48,061 --> 00:23:50,313
Wow. I've never heard that one.

483
00:23:50,396 --> 00:23:52,148
Expensive way to fall down.

484
00:23:52,231 --> 00:23:55,068
So, have you ever went skating
or anything?

485
00:23:55,151 --> 00:23:58,237
-  Yeah. I'm been on a skate, sure.
-  Yeah? Do you like it?

486
00:23:58,321 --> 00:24:00,615
Well,
that's a cheaper way to fall down.

487
00:24:23,721 --> 00:24:25,390
Pferdekampf rules.

488
00:25:28,411 --> 00:25:29,996
Next on  Primo...

489
00:25:30,079 --> 00:25:31,581
I won an award!

490
00:25:31,664 --> 00:25:33,750
Come on! I earned my spot on that wall.

491
00:25:33,833 --> 00:25:35,585
There's only one fair way to solve this.

492
00:25:35,668 --> 00:25:36,878
Game Champ.

493
00:25:38,379 --> 00:25:39,797
- It combines strategy. Dummy.
- Dummy.

494
00:25:39,881 --> 00:25:41,132
Hand-eye coordination.

495
00:25:41,215 --> 00:25:43,176
-  Thigh strength.
- Yes!

496
00:25:43,259 --> 00:25:44,302
Pain tolerance.

497
00:25:44,385 --> 00:25:45,344
And mental prowess.

498
00:25:45,428 --> 00:25:47,096
- Dude!
- Look, Game Champ is messy.

499
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:48,723
But so is the quest for justice.
