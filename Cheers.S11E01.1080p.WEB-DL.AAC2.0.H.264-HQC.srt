1
00:00:01,563 --> 00:00:04,065
Cheers is filmed
before a live studio audience.

2
00:00:04,099 --> 00:00:06,300
Boy, oh, boy, oh, boy. Yep.

3
00:00:06,301 --> 00:00:08,235
Woody's wedding was quite
an event, wasn't it, Norm?

4
00:00:08,236 --> 00:00:09,736
Oh, man. Huh, huh?

5
00:00:09,771 --> 00:00:11,838
Boy, what a night
that was. Yeah.

6
00:00:11,839 --> 00:00:13,056
Yeah, the priest dying. Yeah.

7
00:00:13,057 --> 00:00:15,318
Carla being caught
in a dumb-waiter.

8
00:00:15,318 --> 00:00:18,055
How about that German guy
trying to kill Sam?

9
00:00:18,997 --> 00:00:22,099
"Du, dort!"
Remember that?

10
00:00:22,133 --> 00:00:23,734
Yeah, oh, golly.

11
00:00:23,735 --> 00:00:26,820
Oh, yeah, but all that
was nothing
compared to the
wedding itself. Yeah.

12
00:00:26,821 --> 00:00:29,139
Oh, now, there
was a comedy of errors.

13
00:00:30,609 --> 00:00:32,443
Hey, it's not quite 2:00.

14
00:00:32,444 --> 00:00:34,745
What do you say we, uh,
stop off at Cheers, huh?

15
00:00:34,746 --> 00:00:36,514
Won't, uh...
won't Vera be angry?

16
00:00:36,548 --> 00:00:38,816
- She'll never know.
- Yeah, well, I guess not.

17
00:00:38,817 --> 00:00:41,385
She... she sure put away
that champagne at the wedding.

18
00:00:41,386 --> 00:00:43,754
Yeah, she's a big girl.

19
00:00:43,789 --> 00:00:46,791
Yeah, she's still out cold, too.

20
00:00:48,427 --> 00:00:51,529
Okay, just don't slam the
door when you get out.

21
00:00:51,563 --> 00:00:53,431
And remember... crack a window.

22
00:00:53,432 --> 00:00:55,199
You're a good husband,
Norm Peterson.

29
00:01:40,392 --> 00:01:41,895
Okay, Sammy, I'm going home.

30
00:01:41,896 --> 00:01:43,364
I put away all the glasses.

31
00:01:43,498 --> 00:01:45,549
The, uh, bottles
are in the storeroom,

32
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:48,252
and all the rest of the garbage
from the wedding's
in the office.

33
00:01:48,253 --> 00:01:49,486
Thank you, honey, I'll lock up.

34
00:01:49,487 --> 00:01:52,957
- Where's Rebecca?
- Just told you,
she's in the office.

35
00:01:53,267 --> 00:01:57,478
Hey, Norm, uh, you mind
if we make a stop or two
on the way home?

36
00:01:57,512 --> 00:02:00,113
I, uh, forgot
to finish my route.

37
00:02:00,148 --> 00:02:02,015
Cliff, no.

38
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:04,218
Eh, all right.
I'll do it tomorrow.

39
00:02:07,189 --> 00:02:10,023
- Hey, Rebecca.
- Hi, Sam.

40
00:02:10,058 --> 00:02:11,492
You okay?

41
00:02:11,493 --> 00:02:13,194
Yeah, I'm just thinking,
you know.

42
00:02:13,195 --> 00:02:15,262
Weddings always make me do that.

43
00:02:15,264 --> 00:02:18,265
I have nothing
to show for my life. Oh, come on.

44
00:02:18,266 --> 00:02:19,950
You're being a little harsh
on yourself, aren't you?

45
00:02:19,951 --> 00:02:22,185
I mean, come on,
take a look at today, right?

46
00:02:22,186 --> 00:02:23,936
The wedding started
to fall apart.

47
00:02:23,955 --> 00:02:26,156
You pulled the whole
thing together.

48
00:02:26,157 --> 00:02:27,624
Yeah, I sort of did, didn't I?

49
00:02:27,625 --> 00:02:28,892
You bet you did.

50
00:02:28,893 --> 00:02:30,610
You know, you know,
I used to think

51
00:02:30,611 --> 00:02:33,613
that if I married a millionaire
or if I had a baby,

52
00:02:33,648 --> 00:02:36,217
I'd be a better person,
but now I realize

53
00:02:36,251 --> 00:02:39,787
that the only thing
that's gonna make me
a better person is me.

54
00:02:39,788 --> 00:02:42,956
Boy, as scary
as that sounds, it's true.

55
00:02:43,025 --> 00:02:44,809
In fact, you see this cigarette?

56
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:47,228
This is the last cigarette
I'm gonna smoke forever.

57
00:02:47,229 --> 00:02:49,930
This is gonna be my...
my symbol of change,

58
00:02:49,931 --> 00:02:51,398
you know, the old Rebecca
burning away.

59
00:02:51,399 --> 00:02:52,766
And I'll tell you
something else.

60
00:02:52,767 --> 00:02:55,302
Starting tomorrow,
there's gonna be no more whining

61
00:02:55,303 --> 00:02:56,503
and no more complaining.

62
00:02:56,504 --> 00:02:59,606
I am gonna be the best manager
in the whole world.

63
00:03:00,776 --> 00:03:03,243
Okay, good night.

64
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:07,014
I gotta get my life together.

65
00:03:07,016 --> 00:03:08,498
No more screw ups.

66
00:03:08,533 --> 00:03:10,400
No more mistakes.

67
00:03:13,237 --> 00:03:15,339
Good-bye, old Rebecca.

68
00:03:34,247 --> 00:03:36,560
Well, I think we've got this one
pretty much under control.

69
00:03:36,561 --> 00:03:37,862
You get hold of the owner?

70
00:03:37,863 --> 00:03:39,696
Yes, sir, should be
here any minute.

71
00:03:39,748 --> 00:03:42,416
Engines 28 and 30 can head back.

72
00:03:45,471 --> 00:03:47,688
oh, my God.

73
00:03:47,756 --> 00:03:48,906
Mr. Malone.

74
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:51,408
Everything's under control.

75
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:53,277
The fire's out, no one was hurt.

76
00:03:53,311 --> 00:03:56,580
It was basically confined
to this end of the bar.

77
00:03:58,783 --> 00:04:00,834
oh, this is terrible.

78
00:04:03,388 --> 00:04:05,089
How did...

79
00:04:05,123 --> 00:04:07,091
This is my bar.

80
00:04:10,395 --> 00:04:11,962
Oh, man.

81
00:04:13,731 --> 00:04:16,367
Oh, oh, yes, wait a minute.

82
00:04:18,153 --> 00:04:19,303
Oh, thank God!

83
00:04:21,672 --> 00:04:24,708
This is great.
This is really good.

84
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:25,943
I'm sorry?

85
00:04:25,944 --> 00:04:28,128
Gary, you know, from
Gary's Olde Towne Tavern?

86
00:04:28,129 --> 00:04:30,714
Oh, we're doing...
always doing pranks
like this, you know.

87
00:04:30,715 --> 00:04:32,850
First, he makes the bar
look like it burned down,

88
00:04:32,851 --> 00:04:35,035
and then he gets you guys
to go along with it.

89
00:04:35,053 --> 00:04:36,703
You are very good.

90
00:04:39,591 --> 00:04:41,575
Come on, lighten up, will you?

91
00:04:41,609 --> 00:04:44,561
Come on, Gary!
Come on out.

92
00:04:44,562 --> 00:04:46,329
Hey, you know,
time to push the button,

93
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:48,431
make everything
go back together again, Gary.

94
00:04:48,432 --> 00:04:50,000
Gary!

95
00:04:56,858 --> 00:04:58,441
It's not Gary, is it?

96
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:07,952
Sammy, this is terrible.

97
00:05:08,291 --> 00:05:12,256
You know, it just hurts me
just to look at this place.

98
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:13,607
I know, I know.

99
00:05:13,642 --> 00:05:15,242
But I'll tell you something.

100
00:05:15,243 --> 00:05:16,960
As soon as the
insurance kicks in,

101
00:05:16,961 --> 00:05:19,923
we're gonna get this place
back on its feet
in a couple of weeks.

102
00:05:19,948 --> 00:05:21,782
I just wish I knew
how it started.

103
00:05:23,184 --> 00:05:25,419
Hold it right there.

104
00:05:25,453 --> 00:05:27,120
What are you saying, Sammy?

105
00:05:27,122 --> 00:05:30,290
That a Tortelli kid
would torch his mother's

106
00:05:30,325 --> 00:05:32,426
place of business
just for spite?

107
00:05:32,527 --> 00:05:34,311
No, I'd never think that.

108
00:05:34,396 --> 00:05:36,513
Why not? It's plausible.

109
00:05:36,514 --> 00:05:39,549
Listen, just...
just start cleaning up.

110
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:42,469
You know, we're gonna...
all gonna feel better
if we just start cleaning up.

111
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:45,706
You know, I gotta say, Sammy,
you're taking this whole thing
pretty darn well.

112
00:05:45,707 --> 00:05:47,173
Not like some people.

113
00:05:47,208 --> 00:05:48,808
Oh, the humanity.

114
00:05:51,812 --> 00:05:54,481
Norm, I wish you'd
stop saying that.

115
00:05:54,515 --> 00:05:56,617
You've got to get a
hold of yourself.

116
00:05:58,053 --> 00:05:59,486
I'm sorry, I... I just...

117
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:03,757
This place means
so damn much to me.

118
00:06:03,791 --> 00:06:05,609
It's my home.

119
00:06:05,643 --> 00:06:09,162
Hell, for the last few years,
it's been my life.

120
00:06:09,163 --> 00:06:10,963
And the thought of living
without it, Sammy...

121
00:06:13,351 --> 00:06:15,118
Oh, buddy.

122
00:06:15,119 --> 00:06:17,703
Now, I'm gonna be over at Gary's
for the next few days, okay?

123
00:06:18,857 --> 00:06:22,526
I want you to give me a call
when it looks decent, all right?

124
00:06:25,163 --> 00:06:27,247
Somebody said
there'd been a fire.

125
00:06:27,332 --> 00:06:30,800
Oh, my God,
I had no idea it was this bad.

126
00:06:30,835 --> 00:06:32,302
Sam, what happened?

127
00:06:32,303 --> 00:06:33,737
We don't know yet, sweetheart.

128
00:06:33,738 --> 00:06:35,539
But don't worry,
everything's gonna be fine.

129
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:37,091
I've already called
the contractor,

130
00:06:37,092 --> 00:06:39,609
phone company,
the electric guy.

131
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:40,877
I think that's everybody.

132
00:06:40,929 --> 00:06:42,562
Sam...?

133
00:06:43,515 --> 00:06:46,282
Well, almost everybody.

134
00:06:46,301 --> 00:06:49,303
Well, Sam, I see you monkeys
have discovered fire.

135
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:55,558
Would you like to come upstairs

136
00:06:55,559 --> 00:06:57,309
and see the damage
at Melville's?

137
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:59,747
You know, why not?

138
00:06:59,781 --> 00:07:02,215
It might even cheer me up.

139
00:07:04,286 --> 00:07:05,686
Hi, everybody.

140
00:07:07,122 --> 00:07:08,888
What happened here?

141
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:10,223
Woody, we had a fire.

142
00:07:10,241 --> 00:07:12,793
Oh, no.

143
00:07:12,827 --> 00:07:15,395
This is terrible.

144
00:07:15,429 --> 00:07:18,866
This is Cheers, my home
for the past seven years,

145
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:22,069
the place where I grew
up, and now look at it.

146
00:07:22,071 --> 00:07:25,272
You ought to see the pool table.
It actually fused to the floor.

147
00:07:25,274 --> 00:07:27,141
Really? Cool.

148
00:07:29,928 --> 00:07:37,334
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, oh, my God.

149
00:07:39,304 --> 00:07:41,504
Oh, my God.

150
00:07:44,409 --> 00:07:46,710
Cliff, was that
undelivered mail?

151
00:07:46,778 --> 00:07:48,545
Oh, yeah, it was, Doc.

152
00:07:49,998 --> 00:07:52,099
my sweet Lord,
what a catastrophe.

153
00:07:52,133 --> 00:07:55,768
I mean, there could be letters
from mothers to sons in there.

154
00:07:55,803 --> 00:07:58,338
Social Security checks,
wedding invitations.

155
00:07:59,874 --> 00:08:02,609
Well, there's only one thing
left for me to do now.

156
00:08:02,627 --> 00:08:03,693
What's that, Cliff?

157
00:08:03,712 --> 00:08:06,813
Get up early tomorrow
and stage a Jeep accident.

158
00:08:07,943 --> 00:08:12,402
Well, it's a good thing
this fire didn't spread.

159
00:08:12,403 --> 00:08:15,839
It could have been
like that fire
my great-grandmother's
cow started.

160
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:19,126
Darned thing kicked
over a lantern,

161
00:08:19,127 --> 00:08:20,937
burned an entire city
to the ground.

162
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:26,199
Yep.
The shame was so great,
the family had to move to Ohio

163
00:08:26,234 --> 00:08:28,569
and change their last name
to Wilkins.

164
00:08:29,788 --> 00:08:33,723
But, Woody, you're from Indiana,
and your family name is Boyd.

165
00:08:33,758 --> 00:08:36,660
Oh, well, some stuff
happened in Ohio.

166
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:41,598
Come on, Woody, we've got
to get to the airport.

167
00:08:43,534 --> 00:08:45,969
You know,
when these things happen,

168
00:08:46,004 --> 00:08:48,205
it really makes you
stop and think.

169
00:08:50,124 --> 00:08:53,326
Bye, everybody.

170
00:08:53,361 --> 00:08:55,962
Next time you see us,
we'll be tan.

171
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:57,297
Bye, Woody.

172
00:08:59,184 --> 00:09:02,235
Well, I discovered
the cause of the fire.

173
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:03,903
Same old story.

174
00:09:03,938 --> 00:09:07,191
Some idiot tosses a cigarette
into a trash can,

175
00:09:07,225 --> 00:09:08,625
and the whole thing goes up.

176
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:10,426
Are you sure?

177
00:09:10,445 --> 00:09:11,879
Yeah, seen it 100 times.

178
00:09:11,913 --> 00:09:13,914
When are people gonna learn?

179
00:09:18,286 --> 00:09:19,469
Are you all right?

180
00:09:19,504 --> 00:09:20,670
Uh-huh, I'm fine.

181
00:09:22,506 --> 00:09:30,229
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, oh, my God.

182
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:33,156
You know, I couldn't help
overhearing that conversation.

183
00:09:34,102 --> 00:09:36,253
Wild guess: Your cigarette?

184
00:09:38,489 --> 00:09:40,224
No.

185
00:09:40,225 --> 00:09:42,477
Rebecca, you burned down
the bar, didn't you?

186
00:09:42,478 --> 00:09:45,661
What, am I wearing a sign?

187
00:09:45,697 --> 00:09:47,213
Are you gonna tell Sam?

188
00:09:47,247 --> 00:09:48,414
Could you?

189
00:09:48,483 --> 00:09:50,417
I don't really think
it's my place.

190
00:09:50,419 --> 00:09:52,469
No, I mean, could you tell him
you did it?

191
00:09:53,128 --> 00:09:57,424
Rebecca, you have a very
difficult choice to make.

192
00:09:57,425 --> 00:09:59,927
My advice to you is to
simply tell Sam the truth.

193
00:09:59,961 --> 00:10:02,262
He's gonna find out
about it in any event.

194
00:10:02,297 --> 00:10:05,499
You're right.
He will.

195
00:10:05,533 --> 00:10:07,234
All right, I'll tell him.

196
00:10:07,268 --> 00:10:09,402
And I mean,
he's a friend of mine,

197
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:10,570
and it was an accident.

198
00:10:10,588 --> 00:10:12,098
He'll understand, won't he?

199
00:10:12,757 --> 00:10:15,158
Okay.
Thank you, I feel better.

200
00:10:17,312 --> 00:10:20,496
Sam?
Could I talk to you a second?

201
00:10:20,515 --> 00:10:22,232
Yeah.

202
00:10:24,502 --> 00:10:27,003
Sam, we found out how
the fire got started.

203
00:10:27,071 --> 00:10:28,588
You're kidding. No, and-and...

204
00:10:28,589 --> 00:10:32,876
the guy said, you know,
he's seen it happen
100 times, so he's
seen it a lot.

205
00:10:32,911 --> 00:10:35,279
How did it happen? What...

206
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:37,164
I-I'm getting to that, it's
just sort of hard to say.

207
00:10:37,165 --> 00:10:38,115
Please tell me.

208
00:10:38,116 --> 00:10:39,626
All right, all right, I-I'll...

209
00:10:40,201 --> 00:10:42,402
The fire was started by...

210
00:10:45,607 --> 00:10:47,240
Faulty wiring.

211
00:10:50,277 --> 00:10:51,845
Faulty wiring?

212
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:54,280
Faulty wiring.

213
00:10:54,299 --> 00:10:56,566
Been meaning to take care
of that for years.

214
00:10:56,568 --> 00:10:58,084
My God.

215
00:10:59,521 --> 00:11:01,871
I burned down my own bar.

216
00:11:01,906 --> 00:11:03,773
Oh, Sam. Oh!

217
00:11:03,774 --> 00:11:04,725
It's gonna be okay.

218
00:11:04,726 --> 00:11:06,059
We all make stupid mistakes.

219
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:07,828
No.

220
00:11:21,249 --> 00:11:23,643
Okay, guys, I got
the plastic bags.

221
00:11:23,644 --> 00:11:25,144
You can start bagging the soot.

222
00:11:26,681 --> 00:11:27,948
What happened to you?

223
00:11:28,049 --> 00:11:31,233
Uh, a little Jeep accident.

224
00:11:35,556 --> 00:11:38,141
Nice of you to, uh...
join us, Norm. Well...

225
00:11:38,142 --> 00:11:40,677
Thought you were gonna
wait it out at Gary's. Well, I was,

226
00:11:40,678 --> 00:11:42,862
but then it... I
came to my senses

227
00:11:42,896 --> 00:11:45,932
and realized my place was here
helping Sammy.

228
00:11:45,933 --> 00:11:49,118
If we all pitch in,
we'll have this place
back together in no time.

229
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:50,771
Gary wouldn't run you
a tab, huh?

230
00:11:50,772 --> 00:11:52,212
No, he was a real
jerk about it, too.

231
00:11:54,992 --> 00:11:57,043
Rebecca? What?

232
00:11:57,195 --> 00:11:59,328
Have you told Sam
how the fire started?

233
00:11:59,330 --> 00:12:02,498
Oh, yeah, I told him, and, uh,
he kissed me, and he hugged me,

234
00:12:02,617 --> 00:12:05,468
and he-he told me what
a big person I was to tell him.

235
00:12:05,469 --> 00:12:06,870
You didn't tell him, did you?

236
00:12:06,871 --> 00:12:08,655
Of course not, you moron!

237
00:12:08,689 --> 00:12:11,424
Rebecca, don't
you realize
that unless you tell him,

238
00:12:11,425 --> 00:12:12,793
your guilt will get
progressively worse?

239
00:12:12,794 --> 00:12:14,277
You'll start to shake.

240
00:12:14,311 --> 00:12:17,096
You'll get the cold sweats,
insomnia, nervousness.

241
00:12:17,097 --> 00:12:18,731
Suddenly one morning,
you'll wake up,

242
00:12:18,732 --> 00:12:20,934
and you'll be paralysed
from fear and guilt.

243
00:12:20,935 --> 00:12:23,119
I can live with that.

244
00:12:24,555 --> 00:12:26,485
It'll just be like
every other Monday.

245
00:12:27,975 --> 00:12:31,578
Well, I called
the insurance company.

246
00:12:31,612 --> 00:12:33,780
We're not getting a penny.

247
00:12:33,781 --> 00:12:34,614
What?!

248
00:12:34,615 --> 00:12:39,485
Well, it turns out
that my insurance policy, uh,
had a $25,000 deductible.

249
00:12:39,537 --> 00:12:41,638
Isn't that rather high, Sam?

250
00:12:41,672 --> 00:12:44,107
Yes, it is,
Mr. Where The Hell Were You

251
00:12:44,108 --> 00:12:46,278
When the Agent Was
Talking a Mile a Minute?

252
00:12:47,912 --> 00:12:52,398
God, man, I'm, um,
in a lot more trouble
than I thought I was.

253
00:12:52,433 --> 00:12:55,668
Rest easy, my friend.

254
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:58,455
I'm gonna take out my cheque book,

255
00:12:58,457 --> 00:13:01,140
and I'm going to write,

256
00:13:01,175 --> 00:13:02,992
"Pay to the order

257
00:13:03,027 --> 00:13:06,029
of Sam Malone."

258
00:13:06,063 --> 00:13:07,964
Then I'm going
to fill in an amount

259
00:13:07,966 --> 00:13:09,816
that will be more than adequate

260
00:13:09,851 --> 00:13:11,985
to bring Cheers back
to its former glory.

261
00:13:13,554 --> 00:13:15,956
There. I've signed it.

262
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:19,759
Now all we need is the signature
of Lilith Sternin-Crane.

263
00:13:21,863 --> 00:13:24,898
Oh, she'll put up a fight,
the little badger,

264
00:13:24,932 --> 00:13:28,134
but this is important to you,
so it's important to me.

265
00:13:28,136 --> 00:13:30,787
I'm simply gonna go home
and demand that she sign it.

266
00:13:30,821 --> 00:13:32,088
Yes, demand!

267
00:13:32,123 --> 00:13:35,191
I don't care what she says.
She will sign it!

268
00:13:37,945 --> 00:13:39,079
Thanks, Fras.

269
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:42,182
Uh, you know, I'll
probably just go
to a bank or
something, you know?

270
00:13:42,183 --> 00:13:44,801
Oh, thank you, Sam, thank you.

271
00:13:46,471 --> 00:13:49,739
There was... no way.

272
00:13:49,774 --> 00:13:51,707
You understand.

273
00:13:57,532 --> 00:13:59,983
Your monthly cash flow is,

274
00:14:00,017 --> 00:14:02,252
uh, this figure here?

275
00:14:02,254 --> 00:14:05,438
And now you want us
to grant you a loan?

276
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:09,342
Yes, please, and by
the end of the day, too.
Thank you. Uh-huh.

277
00:14:09,377 --> 00:14:13,312
Am I on one of those programs
with the hidden camera?

278
00:14:13,331 --> 00:14:16,166
Oh, no, I-I'm afraid you're not.

279
00:14:16,168 --> 00:14:19,485
I know I'm not.
I was making a point.

280
00:14:19,504 --> 00:14:24,640
Mr. Malone,
there is no way
we can grant you a loan.

281
00:14:24,641 --> 00:14:27,060
I've been to every bank in town.
They've all said no.

282
00:14:27,061 --> 00:14:29,896
Listen, oh, come on, you know,

be the friendly bank.

00:14:36,771 --> 00:14:39,839

everything off your desk here
and offer me a cup of coffee.

287
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,524
You don't even have
any coffee here!

288
00:14:41,525 --> 00:14:42,960
Mr. Malone, good afternoon!

289
00:14:42,961 --> 00:14:44,211

Sam...

294
00:14:55,873 --> 00:14:57,807
I burned down the bar.

295
00:14:57,808 --> 00:15:02,679
And, you know, see,
speaking of bars burning down,
guess what I did?

296
00:15:06,467 --> 00:15:08,818
Hi, Sam. Did you get the loan?

297
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:10,202
No.

298
00:15:11,522 --> 00:15:15,925
It's all right,
though, you know.
It's not the end of the world.

299
00:15:15,959 --> 00:15:19,295
Yeah, I've been
thinking long and hard.
I got a plan here.

300
00:15:19,363 --> 00:15:22,215
You know, I figured
that if I, uh... if I cash in

301
00:15:22,283 --> 00:15:26,102
my baseball pension, you know,
max out my credit cards

302
00:15:26,153 --> 00:15:28,371
and maybe move
to a cheaper apartment,

303
00:15:28,406 --> 00:15:30,241
and...

304
00:15:30,241 --> 00:15:33,476
well... sell the Vette.

305
00:15:33,544 --> 00:15:35,595
A neighbour of mine, Kirby, uh,

306
00:15:35,597 --> 00:15:38,381
had his eye on it
for a long time,

307
00:15:38,383 --> 00:15:41,217
and, uh, he's upstairs right now
taking a look at it.

308
00:15:41,218 --> 00:15:42,551
No, no. Sammy, your Vette?

309
00:15:42,552 --> 00:15:45,221
Well, I... You know,
it'll be all right, um...

310
00:15:45,223 --> 00:15:47,857
she'll come back to me.
She'll-She'll find me.

311
00:15:47,859 --> 00:15:51,911
Like...
Lassie?

312
00:15:56,183 --> 00:15:59,369
All right, Sam,
you got yourself a deal.

313
00:15:59,370 --> 00:16:00,436
All right, okay.

314
00:16:00,437 --> 00:16:01,771
There's the check. Yeah, thanks.

315
00:16:01,772 --> 00:16:03,105
Thanks, Kirby. That's great.

316
00:16:03,106 --> 00:16:07,694
The, uh... the
title and the, uh,
registration are in
the glove compartment. Yeah.

317
00:16:07,695 --> 00:16:08,912
Okay. Great.

318
00:16:08,946 --> 00:16:11,514
Well, uh, so I guess
all I need now are the keys.

319
00:16:15,369 --> 00:16:19,039
Sam, the, uh, keys?

320
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:25,762
Thanks.

321
00:16:30,051 --> 00:16:32,718
Thanks.

322
00:16:32,770 --> 00:16:34,170
No, no! Wait! Wait...!

323
00:16:35,523 --> 00:16:39,342
Please.
Listen, there-there's
another way.
I just thought of another way.

324
00:16:39,376 --> 00:16:40,910
See, I can get this money.

325
00:16:40,945 --> 00:16:43,279
All I have to do is, uh, come up

326
00:16:43,313 --> 00:16:45,548
with a simple product
that America needs.

327
00:16:45,616 --> 00:16:47,901
What?

328
00:16:47,902 --> 00:16:49,819
No. Listen to me. You know,
like-like the Pet Rock.

329
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:53,156
Or the, uh... You know,
the vacuum thing
that-that cuts your hair
at the same time.

330
00:16:53,157 --> 00:16:55,959
Or-Or maybe even,
you know, the-the toilet duck.

331
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:58,328
You-You know, just throw
it together from scraps

332
00:16:58,329 --> 00:17:00,530
around here, you know,
and-and sell millions of 'em.

333
00:17:00,531 --> 00:17:03,433
You know, why didn't I, uh,
think of that before?

334
00:17:03,434 --> 00:17:05,835
Sam, you're just making
this harder on yourself.

335
00:17:05,836 --> 00:17:08,738
Yeah. Uh, yeah.

336
00:17:10,607 --> 00:17:12,308
Yeah.

337
00:17:12,343 --> 00:17:16,245
You know, they, uh,
stole that toilet duck
idea from me.

338
00:17:17,648 --> 00:17:22,785
Yeah. Yeah, you see, uh,
in my original sketches,
I had it as a goat.

339
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:26,555
Look, uh, Sam,
if you don't mind, uh,

340
00:17:26,589 --> 00:17:28,624
I'm ready
to drive my Corvette home now.

341
00:17:35,098 --> 00:17:36,899
Sorry, Sammy. Oh.

342
00:17:38,902 --> 00:17:40,836
Thanks.

343
00:17:47,878 --> 00:17:49,962
Kirby, take care of her.

344
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:55,435
This is a day
I never thought I'd see.

345
00:17:55,469 --> 00:17:57,337
Yeah, me, too.

346
00:17:57,388 --> 00:18:00,573
You know what makes it worse?
This is all my fault.

347
00:18:00,607 --> 00:18:03,243
You know, I'm the one
who did this to myself.

348
00:18:03,245 --> 00:18:05,195
If I'd checked the wiring,
you know?

349
00:18:05,196 --> 00:18:08,464
That's a stupid mistake
I'm gonna live with
the rest of my life.

350
00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:17,306
Oh, come on,
what is it now, Rebecca?

351
00:18:20,527 --> 00:18:23,963
I have something
I have to tell you.

352
00:18:42,433 --> 00:18:45,101
Sam, the fire wasn't your fault.

353
00:18:46,654 --> 00:18:49,839
I was smoking a cigarette,
and I burned down your bar.

354
00:18:50,741 --> 00:18:53,176
You did this?

355
00:18:54,745 --> 00:18:57,947
You did this to me?

356
00:18:58,032 --> 00:19:00,583
Yes, yes, of course.

357
00:19:00,618 --> 00:19:04,053
Why didn't I figure
this out earlier?

358
00:19:04,087 --> 00:19:07,289
My bar burns down,
you're within 50 miles...

359
00:19:07,341 --> 00:19:08,941
it all fits.

360
00:19:10,795 --> 00:19:12,879
Sam, I'm so sorry.

361
00:19:12,913 --> 00:19:16,732
Yeah, what-what...
what were you thinking?
Huh?

362
00:19:16,767 --> 00:19:19,201
You tired of screwing
up your own life?

363
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:21,387
You start to pick on mine?

364
00:19:21,389 --> 00:19:23,539
You know, of all the stupid,

365
00:19:23,574 --> 00:19:27,743
stupid things you've done
in your useless life,

366
00:19:27,778 --> 00:19:29,712
this is your masterpiece!

367
00:19:32,149 --> 00:19:33,882
I'll tell you what. Why...?

368
00:19:35,552 --> 00:19:39,655
Get out.
Get out of my bar.

369
00:19:50,717 --> 00:19:53,385
Sam, it was an accident.

370
00:19:53,387 --> 00:19:54,821
She had it coming.

371
00:19:54,855 --> 00:19:56,656
Nobody had that coming.

372
00:19:56,690 --> 00:19:59,492
I don't want anyone
to defend her.

373
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:01,110
She's gone. Case closed.

374
00:20:01,145 --> 00:20:03,713
Let's just get back
to work here.

375
00:20:03,764 --> 00:20:06,115
I'll give you a hand.

376
00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:09,302
Well, I guess we've seen
the dark side of Sam Malone.

377
00:20:10,637 --> 00:20:13,005
Hmm. You want to see dark sides,

378
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:18,444
you ought to see Ma
when you leave
the shower curtain
on the outside of the tub.

379
00:20:26,903 --> 00:20:29,104
That's something
you don't do twice.

380
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:45,087
I know you don't want me here,
and I'm going.

381
00:20:45,122 --> 00:20:46,922
I just wanted to drop this off.

382
00:20:46,923 --> 00:20:49,058
I cashed in my checking account
and savings,

383
00:20:49,059 --> 00:20:52,061
and, uh, everything
I could scrape together.

384
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:53,545
I owe you this.

385
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:55,398
Good-bye, Sam.

386
00:20:55,399 --> 00:20:56,398
Rebecca, wait-wait a minute.

387
00:20:56,399 --> 00:21:01,654
No.
Sam, look, you and I don't have
anything to say to each other.

388
00:21:01,688 --> 00:21:04,407
You said some things today
that you cannot take back,

389
00:21:04,441 --> 00:21:06,659
and you really hurt me.

390
00:21:06,693 --> 00:21:09,245
And I know
that what I did was terrible,

391
00:21:09,246 --> 00:21:11,948
but what you did was worse
because you did it on purpose.

392
00:21:11,949 --> 00:21:14,717
I don't want to ever
see you or this bar again.

393
00:21:14,751 --> 00:21:17,003
Good-bye.

394
00:21:17,037 --> 00:21:18,805
Do you want your job back?

395
00:21:18,839 --> 00:21:21,523
Yeah, I really do!

396
00:21:30,133 --> 00:21:32,435
I'm sorry.

397
00:21:32,469 --> 00:21:34,737
Listen, uh,

398
00:21:34,771 --> 00:21:38,924
why-why don't I, uh,
get my jacket
and drive you home?

399
00:21:38,958 --> 00:21:41,160
Or maybe, uh...

400
00:21:41,194 --> 00:21:42,612
maybe we'll take a walk.

401
00:21:42,646 --> 00:21:44,580
It's such a nice, nice evening.

402
00:21:44,614 --> 00:21:47,867
Sam, uh, just out of curiosity,

403
00:21:47,901 --> 00:21:51,103
why are you taking me back?

404
00:21:52,956 --> 00:21:55,658
Well, I...
I remember that five years ago,

405
00:21:55,692 --> 00:21:59,128
after I had sold this place,
I came back to the bar,

406
00:21:59,162 --> 00:22:01,464
and, you know, my boat had sunk,

407
00:22:01,465 --> 00:22:03,432
I didn't have a dime,
I didn't have a job,

408
00:22:03,433 --> 00:22:06,203
and I needed someone to give me
a break, and you did that.

409
00:22:08,088 --> 00:22:09,973
And I owe you one.

410
00:22:10,007 --> 00:22:12,225
Sam...

411
00:22:12,259 --> 00:22:16,729
Hey, listen, uh, this
is very important.

412
00:22:16,763 --> 00:22:18,531
We're even now.

413
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,367
Yeah. All right.

414
00:22:21,368 --> 00:22:23,652
You want to go out and
get a pizza or something?

415
00:22:23,653 --> 00:22:25,288
Sure. All right.

416
00:22:25,322 --> 00:22:26,555
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

417
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:28,491
Um, I don't have any money.

418
00:22:28,525 --> 00:22:32,294
Oh, that's okay.
We'll-We'll just
take it out of my life savings.

419
00:22:32,328 --> 00:22:34,130
All right.

420
00:22:35,732 --> 00:22:37,667
This should just about cover it.

421
00:22:37,668 --> 00:22:57,668
translate
