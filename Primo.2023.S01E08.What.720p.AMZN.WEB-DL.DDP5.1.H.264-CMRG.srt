00:00:01,435 --> 00:00:03,104
{\an8}Rafa, great work this year.

2
00:00:03,187 --> 00:00:04,981
Oh, thanks, Miss Pedraza.

3
00:00:05,064 --> 00:00:07,400
I, I really appreciate your help
with everything.

4
00:00:07,483 --> 00:00:09,443
But listen, this is a big summer for you.

5
00:00:09,527 --> 00:00:12,113
You should be thinking
about the experiences you can have

6
00:00:12,196 --> 00:00:14,699
that'll make your application really sing.

7
00:00:14,782 --> 00:00:18,536
Internships, traveling, volunteering.
Any plans like that?

8
00:00:18,619 --> 00:00:21,831
Well, I was mostly gonna swim
in Harris's above ground pool

9
00:00:21,914 --> 00:00:22,999
and play video games.

10
00:00:23,833 --> 00:00:24,792
I see.

11
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:29,922
I mean, come on. I'm 16. It's summertime.

12
00:00:30,006 --> 00:00:32,425
Am I really supposed to, like,
do something amazing?

13
00:00:33,801 --> 00:00:36,012
Julia, what are you doing this summer?

14
00:00:36,095 --> 00:00:38,806
Oh. I started a nonprofit
to tutor underserved youth

15
00:00:38,889 --> 00:00:40,808
in STEM, ESL, and needlepoint.

16
00:00:40,891 --> 00:00:43,269
You should download our app.
I designed it myself.

17
00:00:47,607 --> 00:00:50,151
Well, she's 17, so.

18
00:00:52,278 --> 00:00:54,196
- Hey, Mya.
- Hey, Rafa.

19
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:55,406
I thought track was over.

20
00:00:55,489 --> 00:00:57,908
It is, but some of the team
is meeting for a final run.

21
00:00:57,992 --> 00:00:59,702
It's like the end-of-the-year thing.

22
00:00:59,785 --> 00:01:01,495
Y'all just run for fun?

23
00:01:01,579 --> 00:01:04,040
That's what track is. We run for fun.

24
00:01:04,123 --> 00:01:05,666
What are you doing this summer?

25
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:09,086
We might be going on a trip.
My mom wants me to do math camp again

26
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:12,048
and my dad wants me to re-read
the complete works of James Baldwin.

27
00:01:12,131 --> 00:01:13,132
You?

28
00:01:14,383 --> 00:01:15,718
Very similar.

29
00:01:15,801 --> 00:01:17,720
- Similar plans.
-  Uh-hmm.

30
00:01:17,803 --> 00:01:20,514
Although my college prep teacher
wants me to have this big experience

31
00:01:20,598 --> 00:01:23,059
- that'll juice up my application.
-  Uh-hmm.

32
00:01:23,142 --> 00:01:26,145
- I have no idea what that could be.
-  Hey, Mya. Come on.

33
00:01:26,228 --> 00:01:28,397
Oh, well, don't force it.
It'll come to you.

34
00:01:28,481 --> 00:01:29,899
I'll see you later, all right?

35
00:01:30,816 --> 00:01:31,984
Hey.

36
00:01:34,987 --> 00:01:37,406
What are you stressed for?
You have the whole summer to tell her.

37
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:39,408
No, I don't have the whole summer.
That's the point.

38
00:01:39,492 --> 00:01:42,286
She said she might go on some trip,
or to some math camp,

39
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:43,412
or read books by some guy.

40
00:01:43,496 --> 00:01:44,872
Feel like I should know, but don't.

41
00:01:44,955 --> 00:01:47,083
She's spending her summer
on books and math?

42
00:01:47,166 --> 00:01:48,334
Why do you love her, man?

43
00:01:48,417 --> 00:01:50,169
What if she goes off and gets a boyfriend?

44
00:01:50,252 --> 00:01:51,379
At math camp?

45
00:01:51,462 --> 00:01:52,672
I just have to tell her.

46
00:01:52,755 --> 00:01:54,173
Here's what you gotta do.

47
00:01:54,256 --> 00:01:56,634
You know how when the military,
they're like the first word

48
00:01:56,717 --> 00:01:58,844
and the last word out of your mouth
needs to be sir?

49
00:01:58,928 --> 00:02:00,846
Do it like that, but with "girl."

50
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:03,182
Girl, you look so fine, girl. Like that.

51
00:02:03,265 --> 00:02:06,268
- Has it ever worked for you?
- Boy, no, it has not, boy.

52
00:02:06,352 --> 00:02:09,897
Just get her a present like a vape pen
or a waterbed.

53
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:11,065
Then she'll know.

54
00:02:11,148 --> 00:02:13,067
You want me to buy her a waterbed?

55
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:15,778
Girl, I bought you a waterbed, girl.

56
00:02:15,861 --> 00:02:18,072
See? That sounds dope.

57
00:02:18,155 --> 00:02:21,826
Excuse me, sir.
Do you know who James Baldwin is?

58
00:02:34,004 --> 00:02:35,840
- What?!

59
00:02:35,923 --> 00:02:37,842
Ah, ...!

60
00:02:46,016 --> 00:02:49,061
- What?
- Early dismissal today.

61
00:02:49,145 --> 00:02:51,188
I knew that, dammit.

62
00:02:52,189 --> 00:02:55,317
Is there any way out of this?

63
00:02:56,444 --> 00:02:57,862
- I don't think so.
- Okay.

64
00:02:57,945 --> 00:02:58,946
Right.

65
00:02:59,613 --> 00:03:02,658
Hey, Rafa. What's up?
You know Sammy, the bus driver?

66
00:03:03,743 --> 00:03:04,952
What?

67
00:03:05,035 --> 00:03:08,289
We've been dating for about six months.

68
00:03:08,372 --> 00:03:09,498
What?

69
00:03:09,582 --> 00:03:13,294
Okay. I know you're trying to process
this whole situation right now,

70
00:03:13,377 --> 00:03:16,589
so let me just walk you through it
step by step, okay?

71
00:03:18,716 --> 00:03:22,344
Okay. So, remember the code I got you.

72
00:03:22,428 --> 00:03:24,805
When I was making the deal
with Sammy for his part of it,

73
00:03:24,889 --> 00:03:28,976
you know, cooking him the hot plates,
we got to know each other a bit.

74
00:03:29,059 --> 00:03:34,148
And that's sort of how it began.
We started talking after that, and then...

75
00:03:34,231 --> 00:03:36,525
My sister and I have lived
in seven different cities

76
00:03:36,609 --> 00:03:38,611
and there's always some lame ass
trying to get...

77
00:03:38,694 --> 00:03:40,488
I'm really glad you came.
I like this shirt.

78
00:03:40,571 --> 00:03:41,572
- You like this?
- Yeah.

79
00:03:41,655 --> 00:03:43,407
Idiot brothers who broke my shelf.

80
00:03:43,491 --> 00:03:46,243
You know that bookshelf I had with, yeah.
They broke my shelf.

81
00:03:50,915 --> 00:03:53,042
- Your sandwich.
- Aw, thank you.

82
00:03:53,125 --> 00:03:54,335
You're welcome.

83
00:03:54,418 --> 00:03:55,961
-  Almost done.

84
00:03:56,045 --> 00:03:57,671
-  Here we go.
- What was that?

85
00:03:57,755 --> 00:03:59,298
-  I found every word.
-  That doesn't count.

86
00:03:59,381 --> 00:04:01,008
- You just circled everything.
-  Yes.

87
00:04:02,468 --> 00:04:05,304
Hey, look, man, we made a bet.
You lost.

88
00:04:05,387 --> 00:04:07,431
If you had a heart attack, you'd die.

89
00:04:07,515 --> 00:04:09,600
- So, you owe me 40 bucks. Fair's fair.
- Thank you.

90
00:04:11,268 --> 00:04:13,729
Nice to officially meet you, Rafa.

91
00:04:16,899 --> 00:04:18,275
Six months?

92
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:25,449
Good work. Great stuff, Ma.

93
00:04:25,533 --> 00:04:26,951
Congratulations!

94
00:04:28,077 --> 00:04:29,495
Thanks, Rafa.

95
00:04:29,578 --> 00:04:32,039
- Have you told the uncles yet?
- No.

96
00:04:32,122 --> 00:04:37,002
Can I please be there when you do?
We should record it.

97
00:04:37,086 --> 00:04:41,882
Oh. They're gonna murder you, sir.
It's gonna be amazing.

98
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:44,718
Okay. Here we go.

99
00:04:46,136 --> 00:04:47,513
I'm dating Sammy the bus driver.

100
00:04:48,806 --> 00:04:51,100
You all have one minute
and forty-five seconds

101
00:04:51,183 --> 00:04:55,354
to ask me whatever questions you want,
and then I'm not talking about it anymore.

102
00:04:55,437 --> 00:04:57,773
-  Hold on a second.
-  Nope. Go.

103
00:04:57,857 --> 00:05:00,442
- How long has this been going on?
- Officially, about six months.

104
00:05:00,526 --> 00:05:02,862
- How'd you keep this hidden from us?
- Easy. You're all oblivious.

105
00:05:03,487 --> 00:05:06,156
- Is he nice to you?
- Yes. He's a lovely guy.

106
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,908
- How did you meet?
- On the bus.

107
00:05:07,992 --> 00:05:09,159
How fast can a bus go?

108
00:05:10,035 --> 00:05:11,287
That's your question?

109
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:14,874
Yeah. Like, how fast can a bus go?
I've always wanted to know.

110
00:05:14,957 --> 00:05:17,251
- I, I don't know.
- Why has he not proposed to you yet?

111
00:05:17,334 --> 00:05:18,794
Because he's not a psychopath.

112
00:05:18,878 --> 00:05:21,714
Does Sammy take the bus to work?
And if so, who drives it?

113
00:05:21,797 --> 00:05:23,883
You know there are other buses
and other bus drivers.

114
00:05:23,966 --> 00:05:25,467
Could  Speed  happen in real life?

115
00:05:25,551 --> 00:05:27,261
Like a bus that has to go
50 miles per hour

116
00:05:27,344 --> 00:05:29,054
- or else it's gonna explode?
- I don't know.

117
00:05:29,138 --> 00:05:30,556
Is the bus the king of the vehicles

118
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:32,433
the same way that the lion
is the king of animals?

119
00:05:32,516 --> 00:05:34,101
Stop asking bus questions.

120
00:05:34,184 --> 00:05:36,395
And if you two get married,
can we drive the bus?

121
00:05:36,478 --> 00:05:38,022
And where do buses
sleep at night?

122
00:05:38,105 --> 00:05:39,899
And this isn't
a Thomas the Tank Engine scenario

123
00:05:39,982 --> 00:05:42,026
where the buses are alive and have faces.

124
00:05:42,109 --> 00:05:44,653
- How many other things can Sammy drive?
-  I have a  Speed  follow-up.

125
00:05:44,737 --> 00:05:46,447
How many times
has Sammy met Keanu Reeves?

126
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:48,449
I don't know. I don't know. None.

127
00:05:48,532 --> 00:05:50,868
And how come they haven't invented
buses that could fly?

128
00:05:50,951 --> 00:05:53,454
Like, you could fly in the air
across great distances.

129
00:05:53,537 --> 00:05:55,497
- That's a plane.
- But like a bus version.

130
00:05:55,581 --> 00:05:56,916
- Still a plane.
- When Sammy's done

131
00:05:56,999 --> 00:05:58,083
with the bus, can I have it?

132
00:05:58,167 --> 00:06:00,586
Why are they called busboys?
There's no buses involved.

133
00:06:00,669 --> 00:06:03,499
There's only double-decker
buses or burgers.
How come?

134
00:06:03,499 --> 00:06:05,799
- You could call it sky bus.

135
00:06:05,883 --> 00:06:09,219
Oh, time's up.
Okay.

136
00:06:09,303 --> 00:06:10,888
So, from now on,

137
00:06:10,971 --> 00:06:14,099
me and Sammy dating,
just a regular part of life.

138
00:06:14,183 --> 00:06:15,142
Any final questions?

139
00:06:16,685 --> 00:06:19,271
Any final questions
that are not bus-related?

140
00:06:20,981 --> 00:06:22,316
- Mike.
- Hmm.

141
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:24,485
Before you ask,
I need you to think very carefully

142
00:06:24,568 --> 00:06:27,613
about whether or not
this is in fact a bus question.

143
00:06:31,533 --> 00:06:32,576
Uh-hmm.

144
00:06:33,744 --> 00:06:36,080
- What were you gonna ask?
- I wanted to know if bus drivers

145
00:06:36,163 --> 00:06:37,373
wear bulletproof vests.

146
00:06:37,456 --> 00:06:39,166
-  Why would they?
- Why would he do that?

147
00:06:39,249 --> 00:06:40,709
Have you seen  Speed ?

148
00:06:40,793 --> 00:06:42,670
-  Ma.
-  Uh-hmm.

149
00:06:42,753 --> 00:06:47,383
I have a real question for you.
How, how did he ask you out?

150
00:06:47,466 --> 00:06:52,179
Like, like, how exactly?
What, what words did he use?

151
00:06:53,597 --> 00:06:58,644
Hmm. Well, actually, I asked him out.

152
00:06:59,645 --> 00:07:01,188
I always liked him

153
00:07:01,271 --> 00:07:04,441
and I had hoped that maybe he felt
the same way about me.

154
00:07:04,525 --> 00:07:06,318
So, one day,

155
00:07:06,402 --> 00:07:10,155
I just summoned all my courage
and I walked up to him

156
00:07:10,239 --> 00:07:13,033
and said I'd like to get
to know him better.

157
00:07:13,117 --> 00:07:15,411
And then, I asked him
if he'd like to have dinner

158
00:07:15,494 --> 00:07:16,829
and he said yes.

159
00:07:16,912 --> 00:07:20,040
We went out,
had a really nice conversation,

160
00:07:20,124 --> 00:07:21,875
and that was it.

161
00:07:23,544 --> 00:07:25,462
I mean, I was nervous...

162
00:07:25,546 --> 00:07:27,131
-  Yeah.
-  Obviously,

163
00:07:27,214 --> 00:07:31,552
but I think I realized
that I would have felt a lot worse

164
00:07:31,635 --> 00:07:36,181
if I never asked the question at all,
you know, like if I never knew.

165
00:07:37,516 --> 00:07:38,726
So, I did it.

166
00:07:41,103 --> 00:07:42,271
Okay.

167
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:45,524
Okay. Good. Thank you.

168
00:07:51,488 --> 00:07:52,823
Can I ask you for a favor?

169
00:07:52,906 --> 00:07:54,700
Anything, baby.

170
00:07:54,783 --> 00:07:58,037
Do we have any banners
that aren't painted on both sides?

171
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:00,622
I think I'd like to have a little party.

172
00:08:09,548 --> 00:08:11,800
I thought you weren't throwing Primo
any more parties.

173
00:08:11,884 --> 00:08:13,469
- He asked me to.
-  Huh.

174
00:08:13,552 --> 00:08:15,012
- Who's coming?
-  Everyone.

175
00:08:15,095 --> 00:08:17,890
His friends, Miguel, Harris, Mya.

176
00:08:17,973 --> 00:08:19,475
I smell cologne.

177
00:08:20,267 --> 00:08:22,603
That's "Gasolina" by Daddy Yankee.
I'd know it anywhere.

178
00:08:22,686 --> 00:08:27,191
Yeah, the lighting in here is romantic.
Are you setting a mood?

179
00:08:27,274 --> 00:08:30,277
No. We just
ran out of light bulbs, remember,

180
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,696
because you guys had
a light bulb fight last week?

181
00:08:34,573 --> 00:08:37,201
Primo's finally going
to say something to Mya.

182
00:08:38,118 --> 00:08:40,162
He's going to sing her the song
of his heart.

183
00:08:40,245 --> 00:08:42,414
- I hate how you talk.
- We have to help him.

184
00:08:42,498 --> 00:08:44,041
-  Listen to me.

185
00:08:44,124 --> 00:08:46,126
God, I'm so tired of saying this.

186
00:08:47,002 --> 00:08:51,340
This is something he has to do by himself.
Stay out of it.

187
00:08:51,423 --> 00:08:54,676
- Yeah. For sure.
Yes, ma'am.

188
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,303
No one likes meddling, you know.

189
00:08:57,846 --> 00:09:00,390
Hey. I noticed you're writing a letter.

190
00:09:00,474 --> 00:09:03,102
- I got a big tip for you.
- It's okay, Uncle Ryan. I got it.

191
00:09:03,185 --> 00:09:05,187
You should write it with a Sharpie.
It conveys strength.

192
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:07,940
I think it would more convey
that I'm a maniac.

193
00:09:08,023 --> 00:09:10,192
Instead of a letter,
get a tattoo of her face.

194
00:09:10,275 --> 00:09:11,485
I do it all the time.

195
00:09:11,568 --> 00:09:13,112
My back looks like a page
from my yearbook.

196
00:09:13,195 --> 00:09:15,906
I think I'm gonna stick with the letter.
Thank you though.

197
00:09:15,989 --> 00:09:18,951
If you're using animal metaphor,
choose a strong animal.

198
00:09:19,034 --> 00:09:20,536
Like a moose or a buffalo.

199
00:09:20,619 --> 00:09:22,538
There are no buffalos in this letter.

200
00:09:22,621 --> 00:09:25,165
When I first told your Aunt Denise
that I wanted to go out with her,

201
00:09:25,249 --> 00:09:26,375
she said to me...

202
00:09:29,044 --> 00:09:30,587
...she's...

203
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:36,677
...I gotta call her.
I love her so much.

204
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:37,928
Excuse me.

205
00:09:42,891 --> 00:09:45,853
Guys. Thank you, but I got this.

206
00:09:46,728 --> 00:09:47,980
I'm good.

207
00:09:54,903 --> 00:09:57,156
- Primo's being a dick today.
- Right?

208
00:10:05,581 --> 00:10:06,957
This is insane.

209
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,292
What do we know about this guy, huh?

210
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:09,835
Is he good enough for her?

211
00:10:09,918 --> 00:10:11,712
Aren't we supposed to be the ones
who decide that?

212
00:10:11,795 --> 00:10:13,422
We need to trust
that Drea knows what she's doing.

213
00:10:13,505 --> 00:10:15,090
"We need to trust
that Drea knows what she's doing."

214
00:10:15,174 --> 00:10:17,843
Shut up, Jay. Ryan's right.
We don't have any information here.

215
00:10:17,926 --> 00:10:19,261
We can just talk to him.

216
00:10:19,344 --> 00:10:21,305
You think he's just gonna tell you
his secrets?

217
00:10:21,388 --> 00:10:23,765
Have you seen
even one single true crime documentary?

218
00:10:23,849 --> 00:10:25,475
"Hey, Sammy. How you doing?"

219
00:10:25,559 --> 00:10:27,561
"Oh, I'm great.
I love being normal and happy."

220
00:10:27,644 --> 00:10:29,104
Cut to a scene of a detective

221
00:10:29,188 --> 00:10:31,523
explaining how they found Drea's eyeballs
in his pocket.

222
00:10:31,607 --> 00:10:33,984
- That's a strong point.
- He's in our bus now.

223
00:10:34,067 --> 00:10:36,612
We are in control.
This is a military operation.

224
00:10:36,695 --> 00:10:40,407
Rollie, work your jailhouse sources.
You find out if he's ever been in trouble.

225
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:43,952
Ryan, I want a full-spectrum cyber stalk
of this man's internet footprint.

226
00:10:44,036 --> 00:10:46,914
Asymmetrical warfare.
Does he have a LinkedIn profile?

227
00:10:46,997 --> 00:10:48,707
Do bus drivers have Yelp reviews?

228
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:50,000
- Find it all.
- You got it.

229
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:52,336
And would you say
I'm the lynchpin of this operation?

230
00:10:52,419 --> 00:10:54,296
I've always wanted to be a lynchpin
or a cornerstone...

231
00:10:54,379 --> 00:10:55,672
Stop talking or you're out.

232
00:10:55,756 --> 00:10:56,924
You got it.

233
00:10:57,007 --> 00:10:59,176
I can consult
his astrological birth chart.

234
00:10:59,259 --> 00:11:01,845
All I need is the exact time, date,
and location of his birth

235
00:11:01,929 --> 00:11:03,013
as well as his consent.

236
00:11:03,096 --> 00:11:05,891
I don't like doing people's charts
without their permission.

237
00:11:05,974 --> 00:11:08,310
No, thank you.
Jay, check in with your crews.

238
00:11:08,393 --> 00:11:10,437
One of them has to have worked with him
at some point.

239
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,648
We turn over every rock,
we look behind every door,

240
00:11:12,731 --> 00:11:15,234
we turn this man's life inside out.

241
00:11:15,317 --> 00:11:16,860
- I got his car keys.
-  Okay. Yeah. Good.

242
00:11:16,944 --> 00:11:18,946
New plan, we just go through his car.

243
00:11:22,282 --> 00:11:24,243
Killing it. That's great.

244
00:11:32,501 --> 00:11:34,169
-  Hey.
- Hey.

245
00:11:34,253 --> 00:11:35,754
I got you something.

246
00:11:35,837 --> 00:11:37,214
- Really?
-  Yeah.

247
00:11:37,297 --> 00:11:40,717
So, I'm usually a little nervous
about playing music for people

248
00:11:40,801 --> 00:11:44,179
because, well, you know
the stuff I like is a little just...

249
00:11:44,263 --> 00:11:46,890
Horrible, weird,
gives me awful nightmares?

250
00:11:46,974 --> 00:11:50,519
But you were super cool
about listening to this band with me

251
00:11:50,602 --> 00:11:53,105
and I thought
that was just really amazing,

252
00:11:53,188 --> 00:11:54,982
because they're my favorite, so...

253
00:12:00,237 --> 00:12:02,572
Haunted Womb?

254
00:12:02,656 --> 00:12:04,157
- No way!
-  Yeah.

255
00:12:04,241 --> 00:12:05,742
It's from their last world tour,

256
00:12:05,826 --> 00:12:08,370
right before the bassist
was eaten by that orca whale.

257
00:12:08,453 --> 00:12:09,746
I love it.

258
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:11,581
- Thank you.

259
00:12:11,665 --> 00:12:12,749
You're welcome.

260
00:12:13,667 --> 00:12:15,585
I actually have something for you too.

261
00:12:17,796 --> 00:12:19,381
You, you wanna take a walk?

262
00:12:19,464 --> 00:12:20,799
Sure.

263
00:12:22,926 --> 00:12:24,386
Everything in here is sticky.

264
00:12:24,469 --> 00:12:27,889
Yo, look.
There's a picture of Gloria with her kid.

265
00:12:27,973 --> 00:12:30,392
That son of a bitch
is two-timing Drea with Gloria.

266
00:12:30,475 --> 00:12:33,020
- Is this tea or pee?
- Women's nail polish.

267
00:12:33,103 --> 00:12:35,147
Gloria must've left in his car
when they were sneaking around together.

268
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:36,440
-  Pee.
- Oh, my God.

269
00:12:36,523 --> 00:12:37,983
His car is registered to Gloria.

270
00:12:38,066 --> 00:12:39,526
He's using Gloria's car.

271
00:12:40,569 --> 00:12:42,863
- This is just Gloria's car, isn't it?
-  Yeah.

272
00:12:42,946 --> 00:12:44,698
Goddammit, Rollie.

273
00:12:44,781 --> 00:12:46,283
I thought they were his keys.

274
00:12:46,366 --> 00:12:47,951
They were on the table next
to his sunglasses,

275
00:12:48,035 --> 00:12:50,078
the ones that say Coffee Slut
in rhinestones.

276
00:12:50,162 --> 00:12:52,372
- His car is over there.
-  All right. Let's go.

277
00:13:02,758 --> 00:13:04,426
- Hey.
- Hey.

278
00:13:04,509 --> 00:13:06,803
I think your brothers
are ransacking my car.

279
00:13:07,929 --> 00:13:12,934
Don't worry about it.
It's just who they are, how they are.

280
00:13:13,018 --> 00:13:16,480
It's just something you gotta deal with.
I hope that's okay.

281
00:13:19,524 --> 00:13:22,194
Sure. It actually makes me feel
kind of important.

282
00:13:23,445 --> 00:13:24,613
Yeah. Now that they've started,

283
00:13:24,696 --> 00:13:26,531
we just gotta let this thing
run its course,

284
00:13:26,615 --> 00:13:27,949
and then everything will be fine.

285
00:13:28,033 --> 00:13:30,702
I mean, I got nothing to hide.
And from what I know about them,

286
00:13:30,786 --> 00:13:32,245
as long as they got something
to keep them busy,

287
00:13:32,329 --> 00:13:34,414
it might be easier for us
to enjoy ourselves.

288
00:13:36,708 --> 00:13:37,876
They're like minions.

289
00:13:40,879 --> 00:13:43,757
Did he just take the battery out
from the bottom?

290
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:45,675
He's really good with cars.

291
00:13:57,104 --> 00:13:59,731
Okay. So...

292
00:14:01,441 --> 00:14:02,943
...I wrote you something.

293
00:14:03,026 --> 00:14:05,404
-  Ah...
- Okay.

294
00:14:05,487 --> 00:14:07,823
Just, just some stuff
that I've been thinking about

295
00:14:07,906 --> 00:14:09,866
and wanting to say to you
for a while actually.

296
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:11,159
And, um...

297
00:14:15,497 --> 00:14:16,748
...here.

298
00:14:20,085 --> 00:14:21,962
You can read it now or later

299
00:14:22,045 --> 00:14:24,381
or, you know, you can throw it away or...

300
00:14:24,464 --> 00:14:27,092
well, actually, it's, you know,
it's kind of important,

301
00:14:27,175 --> 00:14:30,137
so don't, don't do that. Um...

302
00:14:32,055 --> 00:14:34,516
You know, reading it now
is probably my preferred option,

303
00:14:34,599 --> 00:14:36,768
but, but it's your choice, of course.

304
00:14:38,103 --> 00:14:39,438
Rafa, before I open this,

305
00:14:39,521 --> 00:14:41,314
I think there's something
you need to know.

306
00:14:43,733 --> 00:14:46,486
My dad got re-assigned
to a base in Missouri.

307
00:14:47,237 --> 00:14:48,697
We're moving in two months.

308
00:14:50,866 --> 00:14:51,867
What?

309
00:14:57,205 --> 00:14:58,331
You're moving?

310
00:15:00,709 --> 00:15:01,960
We just found out.

311
00:15:04,921 --> 00:15:08,717
I'm pretty sure I know what this is
and I'm pretty sure I shouldn't open it.

312
00:15:09,926 --> 00:15:11,511
I just don't wanna make things harder

313
00:15:11,595 --> 00:15:13,430
than they're gonna have to be
when I have to leave.

314
00:15:13,513 --> 00:15:15,640
If I leave and we're just friends,
I know what that's like.

315
00:15:15,724 --> 00:15:16,975
I've done that before.

316
00:15:18,435 --> 00:15:20,854
But if I leave
and we're more than friends...

317
00:15:24,649 --> 00:15:27,402
Rockwell had a girlfriend
when we lived in Ohio.

318
00:15:28,111 --> 00:15:30,906
When we had to leave for Germany,
he was devastated.

319
00:15:31,865 --> 00:15:33,783
He said they would stay together,

320
00:15:33,867 --> 00:15:36,161
but it's only a few emails and FaceTimes,

321
00:15:36,244 --> 00:15:39,372
which only made it worse
when it ended for real.

322
00:15:42,667 --> 00:15:45,754
I understand. I get that.

323
00:15:57,432 --> 00:15:58,600
I'm gonna head home.

324
00:16:01,853 --> 00:16:02,812
Okay.

325
00:16:20,163 --> 00:16:22,207
We've conducted a thorough operation.

326
00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:24,626
We're ready to declare
Sammy a worthy boyfriend.

327
00:16:24,709 --> 00:16:25,919
Thank you.

328
00:16:26,002 --> 00:16:29,631
Literally couldn't matter less
coming from you bozos, but thank you.

329
00:16:29,714 --> 00:16:30,966
You're welcome.

330
00:16:31,049 --> 00:16:34,052
We do have some questions about Gloria,
the Coffee Slut.

331
00:16:34,135 --> 00:16:37,806
We found some weird stuff in her car.
A bunch of unpaid tickets,

332
00:16:37,889 --> 00:16:40,517
a case of wine coolers
buckled into a child safety seat,

333
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,185
a handwritten kidnapping note.

334
00:16:42,269 --> 00:16:45,063
So, my first question is,
you'd think she'd go out with me?

335
00:16:45,897 --> 00:16:48,316
- You wanna go out with Gloria?
- She seems amazing.

336
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:51,528
And plus, single moms
always have snacks and band-aids.

337
00:16:51,611 --> 00:16:53,530
-  Cake's done.
- Oh.

338
00:16:53,613 --> 00:16:55,991
Thank you. Hmm, there.

339
00:16:56,074 --> 00:16:58,410
Hey, Sammy, can we ask
a couple questions about the bus?

340
00:16:59,452 --> 00:17:00,870
- Sure.
- Great.

341
00:17:00,954 --> 00:17:02,497
Thirty, forty-five minutes max.

342
00:17:05,041 --> 00:17:06,418
Hey.

343
00:17:06,501 --> 00:17:09,296
- How bad is his car?
- Not bad.

344
00:17:09,379 --> 00:17:11,673
Pretty bad. Sorry about that.

345
00:17:11,756 --> 00:17:14,050
Mike is a surprisingly
compelling public speaker.

346
00:17:14,134 --> 00:17:16,720
- I don't know what happened.
- You guys happened.

347
00:17:16,803 --> 00:17:18,722
But it's okay. It's sweet.

348
00:17:22,726 --> 00:17:24,269
Hey, Rockwell.

349
00:17:24,352 --> 00:17:26,813
- Yeah, what's up?
- Can I ask you something?

350
00:17:27,522 --> 00:17:29,024
Totally. Yeah. What's going on?

351
00:17:30,734 --> 00:17:33,236
- You remember Nicole?
- Yeah.

352
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:36,197
When we left then you
and her had to break up,

353
00:17:36,281 --> 00:17:37,532
it sucked, right?

354
00:17:37,616 --> 00:17:40,910
It did a lot. I hated it.
Thanks for bringing it up.

355
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:47,792
But, you know, it was... it was good.
It was good, too.

356
00:17:49,669 --> 00:17:51,671
- What do you mean?
- I think it's part of it,

357
00:17:51,755 --> 00:17:55,550
like relationships,
those four months that we spent together,

358
00:17:55,634 --> 00:17:58,511
it was really nice to be connected
to someone outside of the house,

359
00:18:00,305 --> 00:18:02,223
even if it was just for a little while.

360
00:18:07,562 --> 00:18:08,563
Which one is it?

361
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:11,983
Rafa.

362
00:18:15,111 --> 00:18:16,780
He's cool. He's a nice kid.

363
00:19:03,702 --> 00:19:05,161
Oh, it's a photo booth.

364
00:19:05,245 --> 00:19:07,163
- Come on, come on.
- All right, all right.

365
00:19:14,963 --> 00:19:18,091
Oh, they're coming now.
Let's see. What was that?

366
00:19:18,174 --> 00:19:19,551
I don't even know.

367
00:19:20,677 --> 00:19:21,845
Goofball.

368
00:19:44,409 --> 00:19:45,702
Dear Mya.

369
00:19:45,785 --> 00:19:49,164
Hi. It's me, Rafa.

370
00:19:49,247 --> 00:19:52,041
If you're reading this,
that means I gave it to you

371
00:19:52,125 --> 00:19:54,085
and that's sort of the point
of this letter.

372
00:19:55,086 --> 00:19:58,882
For my entire life,
I've been nervous about everything.

373
00:19:58,965 --> 00:20:01,509
About school, about the future,

374
00:20:01,593 --> 00:20:05,138
about what I'm going to eat for lunch,
everything.

375
00:20:06,139 --> 00:20:08,892
And a lot of times,
I've let that nervousness stop me

376
00:20:08,975 --> 00:20:11,060
from doing something I wanted to do.

377
00:20:11,144 --> 00:20:13,480
But I realized something recently,

378
00:20:13,563 --> 00:20:16,858
feeling nervous about something
only lasts for a few seconds.

379
00:20:16,941 --> 00:20:21,279
But the regret of not doing something
because you're nervous lasts way longer.

380
00:20:21,362 --> 00:20:24,449
So, let me state this
as plainly as possible.

381
00:20:25,158 --> 00:20:29,537
Mya, I like you.
I like talking to you about things.

382
00:20:29,621 --> 00:20:33,833
I like when you play jokes on me.
I even like digging holes with you.

383
00:20:33,917 --> 00:20:36,961
You make everything you touch better,
including me.

384
00:20:37,045 --> 00:20:40,965
And so, despite everything inside of me
saying I should do otherwise,

385
00:20:41,049 --> 00:20:42,884
I have a question to ask you.

386
00:20:45,804 --> 00:20:47,013
Mya?

387
00:20:47,096 --> 00:20:48,473
Rafa.

388
00:20:57,273 --> 00:20:58,942
Why are you running?

389
00:20:59,025 --> 00:21:03,279
I don't know. I saw you running
and I thought we were running.

390
00:21:03,363 --> 00:21:05,657
Wow. You're in great shape.

391
00:21:07,325 --> 00:21:08,952
Okay. I'm good.

392
00:21:11,412 --> 00:21:13,373
I don't know if you read my letter or not,

393
00:21:14,707 --> 00:21:18,336
but... I need to tell you something.

394
00:21:18,419 --> 00:21:21,798
Or... I need to ask you something. I...

395
00:21:25,009 --> 00:21:26,970
Mya Perkins,

396
00:21:27,053 --> 00:21:30,974
do you wanna be my girlfriend?
I hope you say yes.

397
00:21:33,476 --> 00:21:35,144
Love, Rafa.

398
00:21:40,233 --> 00:21:41,317
What?
