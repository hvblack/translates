00:00:01,585 --> 00:00:03,254
{\an8}Rafa, great work this year.

2
00:00:03,337 --> 00:00:05,131
Oh, thanks, Miss Pedraza.

3
00:00:05,214 --> 00:00:07,550
I, I really appreciate your help
with everything.

4
00:00:07,633 --> 00:00:09,593
But listen, this is a big summer for you.

5
00:00:09,677 --> 00:00:12,263
You should be thinking
about the experiences you can have

6
00:00:12,346 --> 00:00:14,849
that'll make your application really sing.

7
00:00:14,932 --> 00:00:18,686
Internships, traveling, volunteering.
Any plans like that?

8
00:00:18,769 --> 00:00:21,981
Well, I was mostly gonna swim
in Harris's above ground pool

9
00:00:22,064 --> 00:00:23,149
and play video games.

10
00:00:23,983 --> 00:00:24,942
I see.

11
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:30,072
I mean, come on. I'm 16. It's summertime.

12
00:00:30,156 --> 00:00:32,575
Am I really supposed to, like,
do something amazing?

13
00:00:33,951 --> 00:00:36,162
Julia, what are you doing this summer?

14
00:00:36,245 --> 00:00:38,956
Oh. I started a nonprofit
to tutor underserved youth

15
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:40,958
in STEM, ESL, and needlepoint.

16
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:43,419
You should download our app.
I designed it myself.

17
00:00:47,757 --> 00:00:50,301
Well, she's 17, so.

18
00:00:52,428 --> 00:00:54,346
- Hey, Mya.
- Hey, Rafa.

19
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:55,556
I thought track was over.

20
00:00:55,639 --> 00:00:58,058
It is, but some of the team
is meeting for a final run.

21
00:00:58,142 --> 00:00:59,852
It's like the end-of-the-year thing.

22
00:00:59,935 --> 00:01:01,645
Y'all just run for fun?

23
00:01:01,729 --> 00:01:04,190
That's what track is. We run for fun.

24
00:01:04,273 --> 00:01:05,816
What are you doing this summer?

25
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:09,236
We might be going on a trip.
My mom wants me to do math camp again

26
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:12,198
and my dad wants me to re-read
the complete works of James Baldwin.

27
00:01:12,281 --> 00:01:13,282
You?

28
00:01:14,533 --> 00:01:15,868
Very similar.

29
00:01:15,951 --> 00:01:17,870
- Similar plans.
-  Uh-hmm.

30
00:01:17,953 --> 00:01:20,664
Although my college prep teacher
wants me to have this big experience

31
00:01:20,748 --> 00:01:23,209
- that'll juice up my application.
-  Uh-hmm.

32
00:01:23,292 --> 00:01:26,295
- I have no idea what that could be.
-  Hey, Mya. Come on.

33
00:01:26,378 --> 00:01:28,547
Oh, well, don't force it.
It'll come to you.

34
00:01:28,631 --> 00:01:30,049
I'll see you later, all right?

35
00:01:30,966 --> 00:01:32,134
Hey.

36
00:01:35,137 --> 00:01:37,556
What are you stressed for?
You have the whole summer to tell her.

37
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,558
No, I don't have the whole summer.
That's the point.

38
00:01:39,642 --> 00:01:42,436
She said she might go on some trip,
or to some math camp,

39
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:43,562
or read books by some guy.

40
00:01:43,646 --> 00:01:45,022
Feel like I should know, but don't.

41
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:47,233
She's spending her summer
on books and math?

42
00:01:47,316 --> 00:01:48,484
Why do you love her, man?

43
00:01:48,567 --> 00:01:50,319
What if she goes off and gets a boyfriend?

44
00:01:50,402 --> 00:01:51,529
At math camp?

45
00:01:51,612 --> 00:01:52,822
I just have to tell her.

46
00:01:52,905 --> 00:01:54,323
Here's what you gotta do.

47
00:01:54,406 --> 00:01:56,784
You know how when the military,
they're like the first word

48
00:01:56,867 --> 00:01:58,994
and the last word out of your mouth
needs to be sir?

49
00:01:59,078 --> 00:02:00,996
Do it like that, but with "girl."

50
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:03,332
Girl, you look so fine, girl. Like that.

51
00:02:03,415 --> 00:02:06,418
- Has it ever worked for you?
- Boy, no, it has not, boy.

52
00:02:06,502 --> 00:02:10,047
Just get her a present like a vape pen
or a waterbed.

53
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:11,215
Then she'll know.

54
00:02:11,298 --> 00:02:13,217
You want me to buy her a waterbed?

55
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:15,928
Girl, I bought you a waterbed, girl.

56
00:02:16,011 --> 00:02:18,222
See? That sounds dope.

57
00:02:18,305 --> 00:02:21,976
Excuse me, sir.
Do you know who James Baldwin is?

58
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:35,990
- What?!

59
00:02:36,073 --> 00:02:37,992
Ah, ...!

60
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:49,211
- What?
- Early dismissal today.

61
00:02:49,295 --> 00:02:51,338
I knew that, dammit.

62
00:02:52,339 --> 00:02:55,467
Is there any way out of this?

63
00:02:56,594 --> 00:02:58,012
- I don't think so.
- Okay.

64
00:02:58,095 --> 00:02:59,096
Right.

65
00:02:59,763 --> 00:03:02,808
Hey, Rafa. What's up?
You know Sammy, the bus driver?

66
00:03:03,893 --> 00:03:05,102
What?

67
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:08,439
We've been dating for about six months.

68
00:03:08,522 --> 00:03:09,648
What?

69
00:03:09,732 --> 00:03:13,444
Okay. I know you're trying to process
this whole situation right now,

70
00:03:13,527 --> 00:03:16,739
so let me just walk you through it
step by step, okay?

71
00:03:18,866 --> 00:03:22,494
Okay. So, remember the code I got you.

72
00:03:22,578 --> 00:03:24,955
When I was making the deal
with Sammy for his part of it,

73
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:29,126
you know, cooking him the hot plates,
we got to know each other a bit.

74
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:34,298
And that's sort of how it began.
We started talking after that, and then...

75
00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:36,675
My sister and I have lived
in seven different cities

76
00:03:36,759 --> 00:03:38,761
and there's always some lame ass
trying to get...

77
00:03:38,844 --> 00:03:40,638
I'm really glad you came.
I like this shirt.

78
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:41,722
- You like this?
- Yeah.

79
00:03:41,805 --> 00:03:43,557
Idiot brothers who broke my shelf.

80
00:03:43,641 --> 00:03:46,393
You know that bookshelf I had with, yeah.
They broke my shelf.

81
00:03:51,065 --> 00:03:53,192
- Your sandwich.
- Aw, thank you.

82
00:03:53,275 --> 00:03:54,485
You're welcome.

83
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:56,111
-  Almost done.

84
00:03:56,195 --> 00:03:57,821
-  Here we go.
- What was that?

85
00:03:57,905 --> 00:03:59,448
-  I found every word.
-  That doesn't count.

86
00:03:59,531 --> 00:04:01,158
- You just circled everything.
-  Yes.

87
00:04:02,618 --> 00:04:05,454
Hey, look, man, we made a bet.
You lost.

88
00:04:05,537 --> 00:04:07,581
If you had a heart attack, you'd die.

89
00:04:07,665 --> 00:04:09,750
- So, you owe me 40 bucks. Fair's fair.
- Thank you.

90
00:04:11,418 --> 00:04:13,879
Nice to officially meet you, Rafa.

91
00:04:17,049 --> 00:04:18,425
Six months?

92
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:25,599
Good work. Great stuff, Ma.

93
00:04:25,683 --> 00:04:27,101
Congratulations!

94
00:04:28,227 --> 00:04:29,645
Thanks, Rafa.

95
00:04:29,728 --> 00:04:32,189
- Have you told the uncles yet?
- No.

96
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:37,152
Can I please be there when you do?
We should record it.

97
00:04:37,236 --> 00:04:42,032
Oh. They're gonna murder you, sir.
It's gonna be amazing.

98
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,868
Okay. Here we go.

99
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:47,663
I'm dating Sammy the bus driver.

100
00:04:48,956 --> 00:04:51,250
You all have one minute
and forty-five seconds

101
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:55,504
to ask me whatever questions you want,
and then I'm not talking about it anymore.

102
00:04:55,587 --> 00:04:57,923
-  Hold on a second.
-  Nope. Go.

103
00:04:58,007 --> 00:05:00,592
- How long has this been going on?
- Officially, about six months.

104
00:05:00,676 --> 00:05:03,012
- How'd you keep this hidden from us?
- Easy. You're all oblivious.

105
00:05:03,637 --> 00:05:06,306
- Is he nice to you?
- Yes. He's a lovely guy.

106
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:08,058
- How did you meet?
- On the bus.

107
00:05:08,142 --> 00:05:09,309
How fast can a bus go?

108
00:05:10,185 --> 00:05:11,437
That's your question?

109
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:15,024
Yeah. Like, how fast can a bus go?
I've always wanted to know.

110
00:05:15,107 --> 00:05:17,401
- I, I don't know.
- Why has he not proposed to you yet?

111
00:05:17,484 --> 00:05:18,944
Because he's not a psychopath.

112
00:05:19,028 --> 00:05:21,864
Does Sammy take the bus to work?
And if so, who drives it?

113
00:05:21,947 --> 00:05:24,033
You know there are other buses
and other bus drivers.

114
00:05:24,116 --> 00:05:25,617
Could  Speed  happen in real life?

115
00:05:25,701 --> 00:05:27,411
Like a bus that has to go
50 miles per hour

116
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:29,204
- or else it's gonna explode?
- I don't know.

117
00:05:29,288 --> 00:05:30,706
Is the bus the king of the vehicles

118
00:05:30,789 --> 00:05:32,583
the same way that the lion
is the king of animals?

119
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:34,251
Stop asking bus questions.

120
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:36,545
And if you two get married,
can we drive the bus?

121
00:05:36,628 --> 00:05:38,172
And where do buses
sleep at night?

122
00:05:38,255 --> 00:05:40,049
And this isn't
a Thomas the Tank Engine scenario

123
00:05:40,132 --> 00:05:42,176
where the buses are alive and have faces.

124
00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:44,803
- How many other things can Sammy drive?
-  I have a  Speed  follow-up.

125
00:05:44,887 --> 00:05:46,597
How many times
has Sammy met Keanu Reeves?

126
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,599
I don't know. I don't know. None.

127
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:51,018
And how come they haven't invented
buses that could fly?

128
00:05:51,101 --> 00:05:53,604
Like, you could fly in the air
across great distances.

129
00:05:53,687 --> 00:05:55,647
- That's a plane.
- But like a bus version.

130
00:05:55,731 --> 00:05:57,066
- Still a plane.
- When Sammy's done

131
00:05:57,149 --> 00:05:58,233
with the bus, can I have it?

132
00:05:58,317 --> 00:06:00,736
Why are they called busboys?
There's no buses involved.

133
00:06:00,819 --> 00:06:03,072
There's only double-decker
buses or burgers.

134
00:06:03,155 --> 00:06:05,949
- How come?
- You could call it sky bus.

135
00:06:06,033 --> 00:06:07,576
- Oh, time's up.

136
00:06:07,659 --> 00:06:09,369
- Okay.

137
00:06:09,453 --> 00:06:11,038
So, from now on,

138
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:14,249
me and Sammy dating,
just a regular part of life.

139
00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:15,292
Any final questions?

140
00:06:16,835 --> 00:06:19,421
Any final questions
that are not bus-related?

141
00:06:21,131 --> 00:06:22,466
- Mike.
- Hmm.

142
00:06:22,549 --> 00:06:24,635
Before you ask,
I need you to think very carefully

143
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:27,763
about whether or not
this is in fact a bus question.

144
00:06:31,683 --> 00:06:32,726
Uh-hmm.

145
00:06:33,894 --> 00:06:36,230
- What were you gonna ask?
- I wanted to know if bus drivers

146
00:06:36,313 --> 00:06:37,523
wear bulletproof vests.

147
00:06:37,606 --> 00:06:39,316
-  Why would they?
- Why would he do that?

148
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:40,859
Have you seen  Speed ?

149
00:06:40,943 --> 00:06:42,820
-  Ma.
-  Uh-hmm.

150
00:06:42,903 --> 00:06:47,533
I have a real question for you.
How, how did he ask you out?

151
00:06:47,616 --> 00:06:52,329
Like, like, how exactly?
What, what words did he use?

152
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:58,794
Hmm. Well, actually, I asked him out.

153
00:06:59,795 --> 00:07:01,338
I always liked him

154
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:04,591
and I had hoped that maybe he felt
the same way about me.

155
00:07:04,675 --> 00:07:06,468
So, one day,

156
00:07:06,552 --> 00:07:10,305
I just summoned all my courage
and I walked up to him

157
00:07:10,389 --> 00:07:13,183
and said I'd like to get
to know him better.

158
00:07:13,267 --> 00:07:15,561
And then, I asked him
if he'd like to have dinner

159
00:07:15,644 --> 00:07:16,979
and he said yes.

160
00:07:17,062 --> 00:07:20,190
We went out,
had a really nice conversation,

161
00:07:20,274 --> 00:07:22,025
and that was it.

162
00:07:23,694 --> 00:07:25,612
I mean, I was nervous...

163
00:07:25,696 --> 00:07:27,281
-  Yeah.
-  Obviously,

164
00:07:27,364 --> 00:07:31,702
but I think I realized
that I would have felt a lot worse

165
00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:36,331
if I never asked the question at all,
you know, like if I never knew.

166
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:38,876
So, I did it.

167
00:07:41,253 --> 00:07:42,421
Okay.

168
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,674
Okay. Good. Thank you.

169
00:07:51,638 --> 00:07:52,973
Can I ask you for a favor?

170
00:07:53,056 --> 00:07:54,850
Anything, baby.

171
00:07:54,933 --> 00:07:58,187
Do we have any banners
that aren't painted on both sides?

172
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:00,772
I think I'd like to have a little party.

173
00:08:09,698 --> 00:08:11,950
I thought you weren't throwing Primo
any more parties.

174
00:08:12,034 --> 00:08:13,619
- He asked me to.
-  Huh.

175
00:08:13,702 --> 00:08:15,162
- Who's coming?
-  Everyone.

176
00:08:15,245 --> 00:08:18,040
His friends, Miguel, Harris, Mya.

177
00:08:18,123 --> 00:08:19,625
I smell cologne.

178
00:08:20,417 --> 00:08:22,753
That's "Gasolina" by Daddy Yankee.
I'd know it anywhere.

179
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:27,341
Yeah, the lighting in here is romantic.
Are you setting a mood?

180
00:08:27,424 --> 00:08:30,427
No. We just
ran out of light bulbs, remember,

181
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,846
because you guys had
a light bulb fight last week?

182
00:08:34,723 --> 00:08:37,351
Primo's finally going
to say something to Mya.

183
00:08:38,268 --> 00:08:40,312
He's going to sing her the song
of his heart.

184
00:08:40,395 --> 00:08:42,564
- I hate how you talk.
- We have to help him.

185
00:08:42,648 --> 00:08:44,191
-  Listen to me.

186
00:08:44,274 --> 00:08:46,276
God, I'm so tired of saying this.

187
00:08:47,152 --> 00:08:51,490
This is something he has to do by himself.
Stay out of it.

188
00:08:51,573 --> 00:08:53,408
- Yeah. For sure.

189
00:08:53,492 --> 00:08:54,826
Yes, ma'am.

190
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:56,453
No one likes meddling, you know.

191
00:08:57,996 --> 00:09:00,540
Hey. I noticed you're writing a letter.

192
00:09:00,624 --> 00:09:03,252
- I got a big tip for you.
- It's okay, Uncle Ryan. I got it.

193
00:09:03,335 --> 00:09:05,337
You should write it with a Sharpie.
It conveys strength.

194
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:08,090
I think it would more convey
that I'm a maniac.

195
00:09:08,173 --> 00:09:10,342
Instead of a letter,
get a tattoo of her face.

196
00:09:10,425 --> 00:09:11,635
I do it all the time.

197
00:09:11,718 --> 00:09:13,262
My back looks like a page
from my yearbook.

198
00:09:13,345 --> 00:09:16,056
I think I'm gonna stick with the letter.
Thank you though.

199
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:19,101
If you're using animal metaphor,
choose a strong animal.

200
00:09:19,184 --> 00:09:20,686
Like a moose or a buffalo.

201
00:09:20,769 --> 00:09:22,688
There are no buffalos in this letter.

202
00:09:22,771 --> 00:09:25,315
When I first told your Aunt Denise
that I wanted to go out with her,

203
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:26,525
she said to me...

204
00:09:29,194 --> 00:09:30,737
...she's...

205
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:36,827
...I gotta call her.
I love her so much.

206
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:38,078
Excuse me.

207
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:46,003
Guys. Thank you, but I got this.

208
00:09:46,878 --> 00:09:48,130
I'm good.

209
00:09:55,053 --> 00:09:57,306
- Primo's being a dick today.
- Right?

210
00:10:05,731 --> 00:10:07,107
This is insane.

211
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:08,442
What do we know about this guy, huh?

212
00:10:08,525 --> 00:10:09,985
Is he good enough for her?

213
00:10:10,068 --> 00:10:11,862
Aren't we supposed to be the ones
who decide that?

214
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:13,572
We need to trust
that Drea knows what she's doing.

215
00:10:13,655 --> 00:10:15,240
"We need to trust
that Drea knows what she's doing."

216
00:10:15,324 --> 00:10:17,993
Shut up, Jay. Ryan's right.
We don't have any information here.

217
00:10:18,076 --> 00:10:19,411
We can just talk to him.

218
00:10:19,494 --> 00:10:21,455
You think he's just gonna tell you
his secrets?

219
00:10:21,538 --> 00:10:23,915
Have you seen
even one single true crime documentary?

220
00:10:23,999 --> 00:10:25,625
"Hey, Sammy. How you doing?"

221
00:10:25,709 --> 00:10:27,711
"Oh, I'm great.
I love being normal and happy."

222
00:10:27,794 --> 00:10:29,254
Cut to a scene of a detective

223
00:10:29,338 --> 00:10:31,673
explaining how they found Drea's eyeballs
in his pocket.

224
00:10:31,757 --> 00:10:34,134
- That's a strong point.
- He's in our bus now.

225
00:10:34,217 --> 00:10:36,762
We are in control.
This is a military operation.

226
00:10:36,845 --> 00:10:40,557
Rollie, work your jailhouse sources.
You find out if he's ever been in trouble.

227
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:44,102
Ryan, I want a full-spectrum cyber stalk
of this man's internet footprint.

228
00:10:44,186 --> 00:10:47,064
Asymmetrical warfare.
Does he have a LinkedIn profile?

229
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:48,857
Do bus drivers have Yelp reviews?

230
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:50,150
- Find it all.
- You got it.

231
00:10:50,233 --> 00:10:52,486
And would you say
I'm the lynchpin of this operation?

232
00:10:52,569 --> 00:10:54,446
I've always wanted to be a lynchpin
or a cornerstone...

233
00:10:54,529 --> 00:10:55,822
Stop talking or you're out.

234
00:10:55,906 --> 00:10:57,074
You got it.

235
00:10:57,157 --> 00:10:59,326
I can consult
his astrological birth chart.

236
00:10:59,409 --> 00:11:01,995
All I need is the exact time, date,
and location of his birth

237
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:03,163
as well as his consent.

238
00:11:03,246 --> 00:11:06,041
I don't like doing people's charts
without their permission.

239
00:11:06,124 --> 00:11:08,460
No, thank you.
Jay, check in with your crews.

240
00:11:08,543 --> 00:11:10,587
One of them has to have worked with him
at some point.

241
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,798
We turn over every rock,
we look behind every door,

242
00:11:12,881 --> 00:11:15,384
we turn this man's life inside out.

243
00:11:15,467 --> 00:11:17,010
- I got his car keys.
-  Okay. Yeah. Good.

244
00:11:17,094 --> 00:11:19,096
New plan, we just go through his car.

245
00:11:22,432 --> 00:11:24,393
Killing it. That's great.

246
00:11:24,476 --> 00:11:26,395
- Yeah.
- That's wild.

247
00:11:32,651 --> 00:11:34,319
-  Hey.
- Hey.

248
00:11:34,403 --> 00:11:35,904
I got you something.

249
00:11:35,987 --> 00:11:37,364
- Really?
-  Yeah.

250
00:11:37,447 --> 00:11:40,867
So, I'm usually a little nervous
about playing music for people

251
00:11:40,951 --> 00:11:44,329
because, well, you know
the stuff I like is a little just...

252
00:11:44,413 --> 00:11:47,040
Horrible, weird,
gives me awful nightmares?

253
00:11:47,124 --> 00:11:50,669
But you were super cool
about listening to this band with me

254
00:11:50,752 --> 00:11:53,255
and I thought
that was just really amazing,

255
00:11:53,338 --> 00:11:55,132
because they're my favorite, so...

256
00:12:00,387 --> 00:12:02,722
Haunted Womb?

257
00:12:02,806 --> 00:12:04,307
- No way!
-  Yeah.

258
00:12:04,391 --> 00:12:05,892
It's from their last world tour,

259
00:12:05,976 --> 00:12:08,520
right before the bassist
was eaten by that orca whale.

260
00:12:08,603 --> 00:12:09,896
I love it.

261
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:11,731
- Thank you.

262
00:12:11,815 --> 00:12:12,899
You're welcome.

263
00:12:13,817 --> 00:12:15,735
I actually have something for you too.

264
00:12:17,946 --> 00:12:19,531
You, you wanna take a walk?

265
00:12:19,614 --> 00:12:20,949
Sure.

266
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:24,536
Everything in here is sticky.

267
00:12:24,619 --> 00:12:28,039
Yo, look.
There's a picture of Gloria with her kid.

268
00:12:28,123 --> 00:12:30,542
That son of a bitch
is two-timing Drea with Gloria.

269
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:33,170
- Is this tea or pee?
- Women's nail polish.

270
00:12:33,253 --> 00:12:35,297
Gloria must've left in his car
when they were sneaking around together.

271
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:36,590
-  Pee.
- Oh, my God.

272
00:12:36,673 --> 00:12:38,133
His car is registered to Gloria.

273
00:12:38,216 --> 00:12:39,676
He's using Gloria's car.

274
00:12:40,719 --> 00:12:43,013
- This is just Gloria's car, isn't it?
-  Yeah.

275
00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:44,848
Goddammit, Rollie.

276
00:12:44,931 --> 00:12:46,433
I thought they were his keys.

277
00:12:46,516 --> 00:12:48,101
They were on the table next
to his sunglasses,

278
00:12:48,185 --> 00:12:50,228
the ones that say Coffee Slut
in rhinestones.

279
00:12:50,312 --> 00:12:52,522
- His car is over there.
-  All right. Let's go.

280
00:12:52,606 --> 00:12:53,899
Come on.

281
00:13:02,908 --> 00:13:04,576
- Hey.
- Hey.

282
00:13:04,659 --> 00:13:06,953
I think your brothers
are ransacking my car.

283
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:13,084
Don't worry about it.
It's just who they are, how they are.

284
00:13:13,168 --> 00:13:16,630
It's just something you gotta deal with.
I hope that's okay.

285
00:13:19,674 --> 00:13:22,344
Sure. It actually makes me feel
kind of important.

286
00:13:23,595 --> 00:13:24,763
Yeah. Now that they've started,

287
00:13:24,846 --> 00:13:26,681
we just gotta let this thing
run its course,

288
00:13:26,765 --> 00:13:28,099
and then everything will be fine.

289
00:13:28,183 --> 00:13:30,852
I mean, I got nothing to hide.
And from what I know about them,

290
00:13:30,936 --> 00:13:32,395
as long as they got something
to keep them busy,

291
00:13:32,479 --> 00:13:34,564
it might be easier for us
to enjoy ourselves.

292
00:13:36,858 --> 00:13:38,026
They're like minions.

293
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:43,907
Did he just take the battery out
from the bottom?

294
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:45,825
He's really good with cars.

295
00:13:57,254 --> 00:13:59,881
Okay. So...

296
00:14:01,591 --> 00:14:03,093
...I wrote you something.

297
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:05,554
-  Ah...
- Okay.

298
00:14:05,637 --> 00:14:07,973
Just, just some stuff
that I've been thinking about

299
00:14:08,056 --> 00:14:10,016
and wanting to say to you
for a while actually.

300
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,309
And, um...

301
00:14:15,647 --> 00:14:16,898
...here.

302
00:14:20,235 --> 00:14:22,112
You can read it now or later

303
00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:24,531
or, you know, you can throw it away or...

304
00:14:24,614 --> 00:14:27,242
well, actually, it's, you know,
it's kind of important,

305
00:14:27,325 --> 00:14:30,287
so don't, don't do that. Um...

306
00:14:32,205 --> 00:14:34,666
You know, reading it now
is probably my preferred option,

307
00:14:34,749 --> 00:14:36,918
but, but it's your choice, of course.

308
00:14:38,253 --> 00:14:39,588
Rafa, before I open this,

309
00:14:39,671 --> 00:14:41,464
I think there's something
you need to know.

310
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:46,636
My dad got re-assigned
to a base in Missouri.

311
00:14:47,387 --> 00:14:48,847
We're moving in two months.

312
00:14:51,016 --> 00:14:52,017
What?

313
00:14:57,355 --> 00:14:58,481
You're moving?

314
00:15:00,859 --> 00:15:02,110
We just found out.

315
00:15:05,071 --> 00:15:08,867
I'm pretty sure I know what this is
and I'm pretty sure I shouldn't open it.

316
00:15:10,076 --> 00:15:11,661
I just don't wanna make things harder

317
00:15:11,745 --> 00:15:13,580
than they're gonna have to be
when I have to leave.

318
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:15,790
If I leave and we're just friends,
I know what that's like.

319
00:15:15,874 --> 00:15:17,125
I've done that before.

320
00:15:18,585 --> 00:15:21,004
But if I leave
and we're more than friends...

321
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:27,552
Rockwell had a girlfriend
when we lived in Ohio.

322
00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:31,056
When we had to leave for Germany,
he was devastated.

323
00:15:32,015 --> 00:15:33,933
He said they would stay together,

324
00:15:34,017 --> 00:15:36,311
but it's only a few emails and FaceTimes,

325
00:15:36,394 --> 00:15:39,522
which only made it worse
when it ended for real.

326
00:15:42,817 --> 00:15:45,904
I understand. I get that.

327
00:15:57,582 --> 00:15:58,750
I'm gonna head home.

328
00:16:02,003 --> 00:16:02,962
Okay.

329
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:22,357
We've conducted a thorough operation.

330
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,776
We're ready to declare
Sammy a worthy boyfriend.

331
00:16:24,859 --> 00:16:26,069
Thank you.

332
00:16:26,152 --> 00:16:29,781
Literally couldn't matter less
coming from you bozos, but thank you.

333
00:16:29,864 --> 00:16:31,116
You're welcome.

334
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:34,202
We do have some questions about Gloria,
the Coffee Slut.

335
00:16:34,285 --> 00:16:37,956
We found some weird stuff in her car.
A bunch of unpaid tickets,

336
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:40,667
a case of wine coolers
buckled into a child safety seat,

337
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:42,335
a handwritten kidnapping note.

338
00:16:42,419 --> 00:16:45,213
So, my first question is,
you'd think she'd go out with me?

339
00:16:46,047 --> 00:16:48,466
- You wanna go out with Gloria?
- She seems amazing.

340
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:51,678
And plus, single moms
always have snacks and band-aids.

341
00:16:51,761 --> 00:16:53,680
-  Cake's done.
- Oh.

342
00:16:53,763 --> 00:16:56,141
Thank you. Hmm, there.

343
00:16:56,224 --> 00:16:58,560
Hey, Sammy, can we ask
a couple questions about the bus?

344
00:16:59,602 --> 00:17:01,020
- Sure.
- Great.

345
00:17:01,104 --> 00:17:02,647
Thirty, forty-five minutes max.

346
00:17:05,191 --> 00:17:06,568
Hey.

347
00:17:06,651 --> 00:17:09,446
- How bad is his car?
- Not bad.

348
00:17:09,529 --> 00:17:11,823
Pretty bad. Sorry about that.

349
00:17:11,906 --> 00:17:14,200
Mike is a surprisingly
compelling public speaker.

350
00:17:14,284 --> 00:17:16,870
- I don't know what happened.
- You guys happened.

351
00:17:16,953 --> 00:17:18,872
But it's okay. It's sweet.

352
00:17:22,876 --> 00:17:24,419
Hey, Rockwell.

353
00:17:24,502 --> 00:17:26,963
- Yeah, what's up?
- Can I ask you something?

354
00:17:27,672 --> 00:17:29,174
Totally. Yeah. What's going on?

355
00:17:30,884 --> 00:17:33,386
- You remember Nicole?
- Yeah.

356
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:36,347
When we left then you
and her had to break up,

357
00:17:36,431 --> 00:17:37,682
it sucked, right?

358
00:17:37,766 --> 00:17:41,060
It did a lot. I hated it.
Thanks for bringing it up.

359
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:47,942
But, you know, it was... it was good.
It was good, too.

360
00:17:49,819 --> 00:17:51,821
- What do you mean?
- I think it's part of it,

361
00:17:51,905 --> 00:17:55,700
like relationships,
those four months that we spent together,

362
00:17:55,784 --> 00:17:58,661
it was really nice to be connected
to someone outside of the house,

363
00:18:00,455 --> 00:18:02,373
even if it was just for a little while.

364
00:18:07,712 --> 00:18:08,713
Which one is it?

365
00:18:10,965 --> 00:18:12,133
Rafa.

366
00:18:15,261 --> 00:18:16,930
He's cool. He's a nice kid.

367
00:19:03,852 --> 00:19:05,311
Oh, it's a photo booth.

368
00:19:05,395 --> 00:19:07,313
- Come on, come on.
- All right, all right.

369
00:19:15,113 --> 00:19:18,241
Oh, they're coming now.
Let's see. What was that?

370
00:19:18,324 --> 00:19:19,701
I don't even know.

371
00:19:20,827 --> 00:19:21,995
Goofball.

372
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:45,852
Dear Mya.

373
00:19:45,935 --> 00:19:49,314
Hi. It's me, Rafa.

374
00:19:49,397 --> 00:19:52,191
If you're reading this,
that means I gave it to you

375
00:19:52,275 --> 00:19:54,235
and that's sort of the point
of this letter.

376
00:19:55,236 --> 00:19:59,032
For my entire life,
I've been nervous about everything.

377
00:19:59,115 --> 00:20:01,659
About school, about the future,

378
00:20:01,743 --> 00:20:05,288
about what I'm going to eat for lunch,
everything.

379
00:20:06,289 --> 00:20:09,042
And a lot of times,
I've let that nervousness stop me

380
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:11,210
from doing something I wanted to do.

381
00:20:11,294 --> 00:20:13,630
But I realized something recently,

382
00:20:13,713 --> 00:20:17,008
feeling nervous about something
only lasts for a few seconds.

383
00:20:17,091 --> 00:20:21,429
But the regret of not doing something
because you're nervous lasts way longer.

384
00:20:21,512 --> 00:20:24,599
So, let me state this
as plainly as possible.

385
00:20:25,308 --> 00:20:29,687
Mya, I like you.
I like talking to you about things.

386
00:20:29,771 --> 00:20:33,983
I like when you play jokes on me.
I even like digging holes with you.

387
00:20:34,067 --> 00:20:37,111
You make everything you touch better,
including me.

388
00:20:37,195 --> 00:20:41,115
And so, despite everything inside of me
saying I should do otherwise,

389
00:20:41,199 --> 00:20:43,034
I have a question to ask you.

390
00:20:45,954 --> 00:20:47,163
Mya?

391
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:48,623
Rafa.

392
00:20:57,423 --> 00:20:59,092
Why are you running?

393
00:20:59,175 --> 00:21:03,429
I don't know. I saw you running
and I thought we were running.

394
00:21:03,513 --> 00:21:05,807
Wow. You're in great shape.

395
00:21:07,475 --> 00:21:09,102
Okay. I'm good.

396
00:21:11,562 --> 00:21:13,523
I don't know if you read my letter or not,

397
00:21:14,857 --> 00:21:18,486
but... I need to tell you something.

398
00:21:18,569 --> 00:21:21,948
Or... I need to ask you something. I...

399
00:21:25,159 --> 00:21:27,120
Mya Perkins,

400
00:21:27,203 --> 00:21:31,124
do you wanna be my girlfriend?
I hope you say yes.

401
00:21:33,626 --> 00:21:35,294
Love, Rafa.

402
00:21:40,383 --> 00:21:41,467
What?
