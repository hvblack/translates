1
00:00:09,868 --> 00:00:12,412
<i>- Dee, do you want a hot dog?
- No. Buzz off.</i>

2
00:00:12,413 --> 00:00:15,164
- Dennis, dog?
- Get that hot dog away from me.

3
00:00:15,165 --> 00:00:17,417
You're gonna get hot dog grease
on my seersucker suit.

4
00:00:17,418 --> 00:00:18,968
Why'd you guys get so dressed up anyway?

5
00:00:18,969 --> 00:00:20,701
People get dressed up
to go to horse races.

6
00:00:20,702 --> 00:00:22,004
We're not going to a football game.

7
00:00:22,005 --> 00:00:23,798
You guys are gonna
look like a bunch schlubs.

8
00:00:23,799 --> 00:00:26,342
All right. Mac, you want a raw hot dog?

9
00:00:26,343 --> 00:00:28,344
- No.
- What? Charlie, you're eating 'em raw?

10
00:00:28,345 --> 00:00:31,430
Yeah. Mac and I are
doing, like, this raw-dog thing.

11
00:00:31,431 --> 00:00:33,683
- It's pretty cool.
- That's not what raw-dogging is.

12
00:00:33,684 --> 00:00:36,102
- It's not?
- It's a sexual thing, Charlie.

13
00:00:36,103 --> 00:00:37,186
Well, that's true, Frank.

14
00:00:37,187 --> 00:00:39,856
But in this case, it's a completely
different kind of raw dog.

15
00:00:39,857 --> 00:00:41,265
It's like this whole TikTok trend

16
00:00:41,266 --> 00:00:43,734
where people deprive themselves
of creature comforts

17
00:00:43,735 --> 00:00:45,319
while traveling somewhere.

18
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:47,113
I don't...
I don't get the point of it.

19
00:00:47,114 --> 00:00:49,240
Well, the point is
it's about getting back to basics,

20
00:00:49,241 --> 00:00:51,200
before we were all pampered and soft.

21
00:00:51,201 --> 00:00:52,618
Well, you're gonna
be missing out, Mac.

22
00:00:52,619 --> 00:00:55,913
This whole experience is gonna
be about glamour, opulence,

23
00:00:55,914 --> 00:00:59,125
the majestic excellence of thoroughbreds
earthquaking down a track

24
00:00:59,126 --> 00:01:01,833
while we sip on mint juleps and eat
pimento cheese finger sandwiches

25
00:01:01,833 --> 00:01:03,511
amongst the Southern elite.

26
00:01:03,547 --> 00:01:06,132
Kentucky Derby, here we come.

27
00:01:06,133 --> 00:01:07,925
Whoops. Uh-uh.

28
00:01:07,926 --> 00:01:09,719
What do you mean "oops"?
What does that mean?

29
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,137
We're going somewhere else.

30
00:01:11,138 --> 00:01:14,266
Somewhere else?
Frank, where are you taking us?

31
00:01:15,095 --> 00:01:18,066
DOG TRACK

32
00:01:38,499 --> 00:01:41,083
{\an8}Oh, my God.
This place is a shithole.

33
00:01:41,084 --> 00:01:44,879
{\an8}What are you talking about?
This is great. The dog track, baby.

34
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,506
{\an8}In hindsight, I should've realized
when we got those bus tickets,

35
00:01:47,507 --> 00:01:50,384
the Kentucky Derby is not held
in West Virginia.

36
00:01:50,385 --> 00:01:52,303
All right, let's stop bitching.
What do we wanna do?

37
00:01:52,304 --> 00:01:55,556
- Wanna go place some bets or something?
- This is so low class.

38
00:01:55,557 --> 00:01:58,392
All right, whatever. Let's, uh, get
some more raw hot dogs then.

39
00:01:58,393 --> 00:01:59,977
We'll jump on Mac's raw-dog thing.

40
00:01:59,978 --> 00:02:02,980
You're not getting it, Charlie.
I am the raw-dog in this situation.

41
00:02:02,981 --> 00:02:05,691
I don't wanna eat dogs,
watch dogs or be dogs, okay?

42
00:02:05,692 --> 00:02:07,485
This is not the classy vibe
I was looking for.

43
00:02:07,486 --> 00:02:08,694
Why are we here, Frank?

44
00:02:08,695 --> 00:02:10,571
Well, because this place is closing down,

45
00:02:10,572 --> 00:02:13,533
and I am a minority owner
of one of those hounds.

46
00:02:13,534 --> 00:02:18,371
- You own part of a dog?
- Yeah, 40% of Pennies From Heaven.

47
00:02:18,372 --> 00:02:19,455
Pennies From Heaven?

48
00:02:19,456 --> 00:02:21,249
God, if I was gonna be receiving
something from heaven,

49
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:22,500
the last thing I'd want is pennies.

50
00:02:22,501 --> 00:02:25,253
- They're worthless.
- I gotta pop up to the owner's box

51
00:02:25,254 --> 00:02:28,172
to chop up
with the majority shareholder first.

52
00:02:28,173 --> 00:02:29,757
- So...
- Owner's box.

53
00:02:29,758 --> 00:02:31,884
Okay, I like the sound of that.

54
00:02:31,885 --> 00:02:34,136
Get away from this riffraff
before one of 'em stabs us.

55
00:02:34,137 --> 00:02:37,265
Might be able to get a decent cocktail
up there. Yeah, I'll do that.

56
00:02:37,266 --> 00:02:39,308
All right. Mac, you wanna go
place some bets, dude?

57
00:02:39,309 --> 00:02:40,519
That'll be fine.

58
00:02:41,144 --> 00:02:42,646
Well, let's do it. Come on, man.

59
00:02:43,647 --> 00:02:44,764
All right, how do we do this, man?

60
00:02:44,765 --> 00:02:46,422
Like, how do we know which dog to bet on?

61
00:02:46,422 --> 00:02:49,119
I guess we just pick the rawest one.

62
00:02:49,119 --> 00:02:50,987
Yeah, but how do we know
which is the rawest dog?

63
00:02:50,988 --> 00:02:53,197
You think there's, like,
a one-eyed dog or, like, um...

64
00:02:53,198 --> 00:02:55,283
Uh, I'm pretty sure
they're all gonna have both eyes, dude.

65
00:02:55,284 --> 00:02:56,993
- Yeah. That's what I'm worried about.
- You know,

66
00:02:56,994 --> 00:02:59,620
maybe we should ask
one of these mongrels around here.

67
00:02:59,621 --> 00:03:01,581
- They all look pretty raw to me.
- Get a pointer, right? Yeah.

68
00:03:01,582 --> 00:03:03,667
These are raw, raw people we're with...

69
00:03:04,293 --> 00:03:05,751
Look at that dude right there, man.

70
00:03:05,752 --> 00:03:08,004
That guy looks like Dog the Bounty Hunter.
Who's rawer than that?

71
00:03:08,005 --> 00:03:11,507
He does. He does.
But, you know, his hair routine,

72
00:03:11,508 --> 00:03:14,093
that seems like a lot of effort,
and that is not raw, man.

73
00:03:14,094 --> 00:03:16,262
Yeah, there's a lot of primping involved.

74
00:03:16,263 --> 00:03:18,681
It's a lot of conditioner, blow-dryers.

75
00:03:18,682 --> 00:03:21,767
It's not raw to care that much,
yeah, yeah. What about this dude?

76
00:03:21,768 --> 00:03:24,186
I'm getting a Snoop Dogg vibe
off this guy, right?

77
00:03:24,187 --> 00:03:25,938
- Who's rawer than Snoop, man?
- Yeah, it''s... Nobody.

78
00:03:25,939 --> 00:03:29,108
Well, well, ever since he became
best friends with Martha Stewart

79
00:03:29,109 --> 00:03:30,943
- at the Olympics, that took a little...
- That was weird.

80
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:32,778
- Took the dog out of him.
- That killed it for me.

81
00:03:32,779 --> 00:03:34,531
- Took the dog out of him.
- It killed it for me.

82
00:03:35,407 --> 00:03:36,491
This guy right there.

83
00:03:36,992 --> 00:03:38,284
- Check this dude out.
- Which guy?

84
00:03:38,285 --> 00:03:40,995
Kind of peacing out
against the door right there. He's raw.

85
00:03:40,996 --> 00:03:42,955
- What makes you say that?
- Well, he's not wearing shoes.

86
00:03:42,956 --> 00:03:44,874
Which is fucking disgusting.

87
00:03:44,875 --> 00:03:48,002
- Look at the ground.
- Ah! Dude. No, man. There's something raw...

88
00:03:48,003 --> 00:03:50,504
- Something about this man...
- There's nothing raw about that.

89
00:03:50,505 --> 00:03:53,382
No, I'm getting a good vibe.
You know, I can sense it like a dog.

90
00:03:53,383 --> 00:03:56,053
- Come on.
- I don't think you're understanding
what I'm going for.

91
00:03:56,553 --> 00:03:57,678
Excuse me, um, sir.

92
00:03:57,679 --> 00:04:00,514
My friend and I are gonna place a bet
on the next race.

93
00:04:00,515 --> 00:04:02,725
We just don't know, like,
who's the good dog, you know.

94
00:04:02,726 --> 00:04:06,605
If you're sniffing around for a winner,
I'd bet my last bone on Squeaky Wheel.

95
00:04:07,189 --> 00:04:09,358
Runs real good after a rain.

96
00:04:09,983 --> 00:04:11,777
Loves a wind out of the southeast.

97
00:04:12,444 --> 00:04:15,112
Squeaky Wheel's gonna get the grease
if you ask me.

98
00:04:15,113 --> 00:04:18,200
- Squeaky Wheel. That's a good pointer.
- That your hot dog on the ground?

99
00:04:19,326 --> 00:04:21,994
Oh, sorry, dude. Yeah, I think
I was holding the bag upside down.

100
00:04:21,995 --> 00:04:23,079
I must've dropped it.

101
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:25,581
You eating it?

102
00:04:25,582 --> 00:04:27,084
Uh... No.

103
00:04:27,876 --> 00:04:30,212
- It's raw though, just... just so you know.
- Oh, that's okay.

104
00:04:31,254 --> 00:04:32,506
Good luck with the race.

105
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:34,758
Okay, yeah. Thanks a lot, man.

106
00:04:36,468 --> 00:04:38,761
Nice. That dude was great.
Let's place that bet.

107
00:04:38,762 --> 00:04:41,514
What are you talking about?
I-I think he's gonna eat that hot dog.

108
00:04:41,515 --> 00:04:43,933
- So what?
- A raw hot dog from the ground?

109
00:04:43,934 --> 00:04:46,103
- Oh, Charlie...
- Oh. Oh, Excuse me!

110
00:04:47,104 --> 00:04:50,231
- Oh. Oh, I can only eat foods served to...
- He was shoeless!

111
00:04:50,232 --> 00:04:51,649
- Did you see those feet?
- Oh! I have to...

112
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:54,694
I have to have shoes on constantly. Oh!

113
00:04:54,695 --> 00:04:57,113
- I think he's very, very sick.
- You just...

114
00:04:57,114 --> 00:04:58,698
I'm following your raw-dog idea,

115
00:04:58,699 --> 00:05:01,158
and the second I suggest something,
you're shitting all over it, man.

116
00:05:01,159 --> 00:05:03,494
We're not taking the advice
of a shoeless hobo, okay?

117
00:05:03,495 --> 00:05:05,371
That guy was awesome, man. I don't know.

118
00:05:05,372 --> 00:05:07,957
- I'm trying to do your thing.
- His... His feet look like hams.

119
00:05:07,958 --> 00:05:09,542
He's sick. I think he's very sick.

120
00:05:09,543 --> 00:05:11,669
I do like the sound
of an owner's box.

121
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:15,005
- Yeah, we're owner's box people.
- That's right. We belong here.

122
00:05:15,006 --> 00:05:17,967
- Oof. Little smoky.
- Oh, yeah. My eyes are burning.

123
00:05:17,968 --> 00:05:19,927
- That's the menthols.
- Uh, is it?

124
00:05:19,928 --> 00:05:22,304
- Hey, Frank. My man.
- Hey, yo! Hey.

125
00:05:22,305 --> 00:05:24,057
- How you doing, brother?
- I'm tits.

126
00:05:24,808 --> 00:05:28,853
This is Dennis, and this is Dee.
They're my kids, or whatnot.

127
00:05:28,854 --> 00:05:31,480
Okay. I see you all dressed up.

128
00:05:31,481 --> 00:05:33,983
We were led to believe
we were going to the Kentucky Derby.

129
00:05:33,984 --> 00:05:37,778
Yeah, we thought we were stepping into
a little bit more of a classy affair,
you know.

130
00:05:37,779 --> 00:05:41,699
Yeah. I think you'll find the dog track
to be quite elegant. Menthol?

131
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:44,076
- Yeah, no. Thank you.
- I'm good. I'm good.

132
00:05:44,077 --> 00:05:47,538
Uh, speaking of elegant,
let's talk stud rights.

133
00:05:47,539 --> 00:05:49,749
Got what you want right here, Frank?
Your 40%.

134
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,208
- You did it already.
- Yeah.

135
00:05:51,209 --> 00:05:53,461
I was supposed to film that
for the Saudis.

136
00:05:53,462 --> 00:05:54,545
- Saudis?
- Yeah.

137
00:05:54,546 --> 00:05:55,838
Man, I don't do business with them.

138
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:58,632
- What do you think they're talking about?
- You gotta do it again so I can film it.

139
00:05:58,633 --> 00:06:00,760
- Before a race? No way, Frank.
- Yes, before the race.

140
00:06:00,761 --> 00:06:02,595
- The milking's done.
- Yes, yes.

141
00:06:02,596 --> 00:06:04,638
I believe they're talking
about masturbating a dog.

142
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:05,806
That's what I was worried about.

143
00:06:05,807 --> 00:06:08,058
- Um, okay, guys. Uh... We're outta of here.
- Mm-hmm.

144
00:06:08,059 --> 00:06:11,771
No, w-wait, wait.
The Saudis will pay big money for that.

145
00:06:11,772 --> 00:06:14,482
- Is that right?
- Yes, but that... that jar

146
00:06:14,483 --> 00:06:17,526
could have a-a border collie's jizz in it
for all I know.

147
00:06:17,527 --> 00:06:19,320
- Yeah.
- I got... gotta be sure.

148
00:06:19,321 --> 00:06:21,739
I got... Okay, what we should do,

149
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:25,452
we could sneak down there,
and I could film you guys getting it.

150
00:06:26,762 --> 00:06:29,205
He wants us to get it.
We're not jerking a dog off, Frank.

151
00:06:29,206 --> 00:06:30,748
- That's not gonna happen.
- That's not something we're doing today.

152
00:06:30,749 --> 00:06:32,166
That's not the kind of day
we were looking to have.

153
00:06:32,167 --> 00:06:34,627
Okay, all right. You don't have
to help me with the dog.

154
00:06:34,628 --> 00:06:36,629
But don't take it out on the track.

155
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:38,172
I mean, you can still have some fun.

156
00:06:38,173 --> 00:06:40,549
Why don't you put a bet on the first race?

157
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:43,969
Here, here, I'll tell you what.
Put $10 on Squeaky Wheel.

158
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:45,721
- I hate these stupid dog names.
- You too. Take this.

159
00:06:45,722 --> 00:06:48,015
- Here, well, you go too.
- I'm not gonna not take it.

160
00:06:50,894 --> 00:06:52,938
Holy shit, dude. They are fast.

161
00:06:54,523 --> 00:06:55,606
That is impressive.

162
00:06:55,607 --> 00:06:58,016
<i>Around the final turn.
Squeaky Wheel making a move.</i>

163
00:06:59,236 --> 00:07:02,363
<i>- Down the stretch, here they come.
It's Squeaky Wheel!</i>

164
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:06,200
Oh! Baby! Who won? Who won?

165
00:07:06,201 --> 00:07:09,411
- Squeaky Wheel by a mile, dude.
- We would've won, dude. Come on.

166
00:07:09,412 --> 00:07:12,457
We gotta go find that raw dog guy.
That's our guy. That's our dog, man.

167
00:07:13,041 --> 00:07:15,501
- Squeaky Wheel!
- Okay! Okay! Okay!

168
00:07:15,502 --> 00:07:17,002
- What'd I tell you, huh?
- Yeah.

169
00:07:17,003 --> 00:07:19,380
- How much do we win?
- $200 each.

170
00:07:19,381 --> 00:07:20,923
- Really? Oh, my God.
- What?

171
00:07:20,924 --> 00:07:23,342
Frank, I gotta tell you,
there's a real rush in this.

172
00:07:23,343 --> 00:07:25,344
- Anybody want a screwdriver?
- Yes. Yeah.

173
00:07:25,345 --> 00:07:27,846
Toss me one of those menthols too,
while you're at it.

174
00:07:27,847 --> 00:07:30,099
Yeah, gross.
Hey, Frank, when's the next race?

175
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:32,685
Oh. We got a minute. What?
Were you looking for action?

176
00:07:32,686 --> 00:07:34,603
- Uh, maybe. Yeah.
- What do you have in mind?

177
00:07:34,604 --> 00:07:36,188
Rochambeau for a hundred dollars.

178
00:07:36,189 --> 00:07:37,606
- I'm in. Ready?
- Wait, what?

179
00:07:37,607 --> 00:07:39,276
Rock, paper, scissors, shoot.

180
00:07:40,277 --> 00:07:42,361
- Rock beats scissors. I'm up 300 bucks.
- Yeah, yeah.

181
00:07:42,362 --> 00:07:44,405
- Okay. I go, I go, I go.
- I'm up 300 bucks.

182
00:07:44,406 --> 00:07:46,908
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Rock, paper, scissors, shoot.

183
00:07:47,993 --> 00:07:50,202
Same one? Seriously, dummy?

184
00:07:50,203 --> 00:07:51,745
Pay me, bitch.

185
00:07:51,746 --> 00:07:54,039
I'll tell you what.
We'll go $500 each, right?

186
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,833
- Right here. Ready?
- Absolutely, absolutely.

187
00:07:55,834 --> 00:07:57,042
I'll call this one. Ready?

188
00:07:57,043 --> 00:07:59,087
- All right.
- Uh-huh. Rock, paper, scissors, shoot.

189
00:08:00,005 --> 00:08:03,173
I didn't know he was gonna do
the same one three times.

190
00:08:03,174 --> 00:08:07,386
Yeah, I guess we lost it all, didn't we?
Is that it?

191
00:08:07,387 --> 00:08:09,638
- That's all right. We'll win it back.
- Yeah. We'll win it back.

192
00:08:09,639 --> 00:08:11,473
- Frank, what else... can we bet on, man?
- Okay.

193
00:08:11,474 --> 00:08:14,560
What number am I thinking of
between one and ten? A hundred dollars.

194
00:08:14,561 --> 00:08:16,562
That's a good one. Okay, yeah.

195
00:08:16,563 --> 00:08:17,730
- Seven.
- Two.

196
00:08:17,731 --> 00:08:18,982
Nope, wrong.

197
00:08:19,566 --> 00:08:21,568
- You owe me $100. Fork it over.
- Oh, shit.

198
00:08:25,739 --> 00:08:28,532
I don't know if we're gonna find
this guy, man. Maybe he just got lucky.

199
00:08:28,533 --> 00:08:30,117
Nah, this is the guy, man.

200
00:08:30,118 --> 00:08:32,786
This is... This is our raw dog.
Yeah, you know where he is?

201
00:08:32,787 --> 00:08:35,289
He's probably at the ticket window
collecting his winnings, right?

202
00:08:35,290 --> 00:08:36,374
I don't know.

203
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:39,168
Wait a second.
Is that him down there on all fours?

204
00:08:39,169 --> 00:08:40,586
Is he foraging for more food?

205
00:08:40,587 --> 00:08:42,463
Probably just dropped his ticket
or something. Come on.

206
00:08:42,464 --> 00:08:43,798
- Let's go talk to him.
- All right.

207
00:08:44,966 --> 00:08:46,242
Excuse me. Uh...

208
00:08:46,243 --> 00:08:48,302
Sir, hi. I-I...
I don't know if you remember us.

209
00:08:48,303 --> 00:08:50,846
- We didn't get your name earlier.
- It's Sparky.

210
00:08:50,847 --> 00:08:52,514
What you looking for down there, Sparky?

211
00:08:52,515 --> 00:08:54,058
Corn nuts.

212
00:08:54,059 --> 00:08:55,893
See, dude? I told you
he was looking for food.

213
00:08:55,894 --> 00:08:57,062
No, not to eat.

214
00:08:57,646 --> 00:09:00,147
See, people drop 'em,
and they blow onto the track.

215
00:09:00,148 --> 00:09:04,109
Single corn nut can turn a dog's ankle,
ruin its career.

216
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:08,405
Oh, so you're like a janitor here, man.
I do that too. It's actually pretty cool.

217
00:09:08,406 --> 00:09:12,869
No. I take care of the dogs.
But I do like to tidy up on occasion.

218
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:15,080
Like that hot dog that you found.

219
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:17,164
Dogs appreciated that, by the way.

220
00:09:17,165 --> 00:09:18,916
That's what you were doing.

221
00:09:18,917 --> 00:09:21,502
Okay, all right.
But what's with the no shoes?

222
00:09:21,503 --> 00:09:23,713
Dog don't wear shoes, so why should I?

223
00:09:24,506 --> 00:09:27,275
I like to feel what they feel,
know what they know.

224
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:29,894
Dog's a majestic creature.

225
00:09:30,512 --> 00:09:33,848
Ain't no coincidence
that "god" spelled backwards is "dog."

226
00:09:36,518 --> 00:09:41,605
Oh. Dude, I think I had you pegged,
like, all wrong. You are super raw.

227
00:09:41,606 --> 00:09:43,065
- Raw?
- Oh, yeah.

228
00:09:43,066 --> 00:09:44,775
My buddy and I,
we're doing a raw dog thing.

229
00:09:44,776 --> 00:09:47,361
Yeah, I'm trying to re-embrace
my raw dog nature.

230
00:09:47,362 --> 00:09:48,737
Lately I've been feeling no joy.

231
00:09:48,738 --> 00:09:51,949
I've overindulged.
I've been taking crazy risks.

232
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:54,535
I jumped off the top of a jungle gym
the other day.

233
00:09:54,536 --> 00:09:56,829
I went to a nightclub
and got really raw with it.

234
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:58,247
Had a bit of a scare.

235
00:09:58,248 --> 00:10:01,583
I've been seeking my pleasures
through thrills and sexual conquests,

236
00:10:01,584 --> 00:10:03,711
and I think I need to be more raw.

237
00:10:03,712 --> 00:10:05,796
You know,
"raw" spelled backwards is "war,"

238
00:10:05,797 --> 00:10:08,758
and you sound
like you at war with yourself.

239
00:10:10,927 --> 00:10:12,094
This is blowing my mind.

240
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:15,097
Wow, dude, me too.
What else can you spell backwards?

241
00:10:15,098 --> 00:10:18,642
Yeah, I feel like we could...
we could learn something from you, bro.

242
00:10:18,643 --> 00:10:20,352
Y'all wanna learn the way of the dog.

243
00:10:20,353 --> 00:10:21,729
- Yes. Totally.
- Yeah. Yeah.

244
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:24,314
- Could we, like, tag along with you?
- Let's do it.

245
00:10:24,315 --> 00:10:26,108
All right. Yeah, by the way,
how much you win?

246
00:10:26,109 --> 00:10:27,693
- Win?
- On your bet.

247
00:10:27,694 --> 00:10:29,611
Oh, I don't bet on dogs.

248
00:10:29,612 --> 00:10:31,780
Gambling can drive a man crazy,

249
00:10:31,781 --> 00:10:34,492
make him do things
against his better nature.

250
00:10:34,993 --> 00:10:37,454
Gambling will make you lower
than the lowest dog there is.

251
00:10:45,045 --> 00:10:47,130
Yeah, come on, baby. Come on.

252
00:10:47,672 --> 00:10:49,173
Whoo! Yeah!

253
00:10:49,174 --> 00:10:51,358
- Give me that 18 bucks, bitch!
- He won 18 bucks.

254
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:52,843
I got your tie on that one.

255
00:10:52,844 --> 00:10:54,595
No, give me the tie, Dee.
Come on, what are you doing?

256
00:10:54,596 --> 00:10:56,430
- Give me 18 bucks.
- Roll for it then.

257
00:10:57,766 --> 00:11:00,226
- Come on, come on, come on.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

258
00:11:00,977 --> 00:11:02,896
- Whoo!
- Damn it.

259
00:11:03,772 --> 00:11:04,813
- You're so dumb.
- Shit!

260
00:11:04,814 --> 00:11:07,900
Louis, I'll give you this hat
for the dog siring rights.

261
00:11:07,901 --> 00:11:09,018
- No dice, Frank.
- Come on.

262
00:11:09,019 --> 00:11:10,527
Hundred grand,
you can go jerk him off right now.

263
00:11:10,528 --> 00:11:11,987
- Oh...
- Guys, let's keep this classy.

264
00:11:11,988 --> 00:11:13,405
Next bet. Next bet. Let's go.

265
00:11:13,406 --> 00:11:16,283
- All even numbers, I get your jacket.
- No. Let's stick to cash, okay?

266
00:11:16,284 --> 00:11:17,910
- You're not getting my jacket--
- You got no cash.

267
00:11:17,911 --> 00:11:19,737
- I got $3 in my pocket. I got $3.
- You're out of money.

268
00:11:19,738 --> 00:11:21,288
Ten bucks
you can eat that gum off the floor.

269
00:11:21,289 --> 00:11:23,499
- I'll do it.
- No, no. What are you doing? Stop it. No.

270
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,459
Twenty dollars you rip Dennis's jacket.

271
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:27,920
No, I just wanna win my money back.
Don't rip the sleeve. Come on.

272
00:11:30,048 --> 00:11:31,131
Goddamn it! You son of a bitch!

273
00:11:31,132 --> 00:11:33,176
- Here you go.
- Thank you. Yay.

274
00:11:33,885 --> 00:11:36,470
Dee! All right.
Rochambeau to get it tailored!

275
00:11:36,471 --> 00:11:37,597
No problem.

276
00:11:38,389 --> 00:11:42,267
- Suck it, bitch.
You gotta get that shit tailored.
You bitch!

277
00:11:42,268 --> 00:11:44,269
- I like it like that.
- Yeah, it's better like that.

278
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:46,356
- It made it look better. Let's go.
- Next bet.

279
00:11:48,608 --> 00:11:49,608
Yeah, man.

280
00:11:49,609 --> 00:11:52,445
Some folks are
just chasing the wrong rabbit.

281
00:11:52,987 --> 00:11:55,073
They're the one
is really running in circles.

282
00:11:58,118 --> 00:11:59,993
Why are you spitting in the bowls?

283
00:11:59,994 --> 00:12:02,496
Let's them know I'm the alpha.

284
00:12:02,497 --> 00:12:04,790
Dude. That's sick, man.

285
00:12:04,791 --> 00:12:07,334
I'm gonna start spitting
in people's beers at my job,

286
00:12:07,335 --> 00:12:09,378
- Let them know, like, I'm the--
- Nah, don't do that though.

287
00:12:09,379 --> 00:12:12,714
Goddamn mutt. Do you have any idea
how much money I blew on you?

288
00:12:12,715 --> 00:12:14,550
Excuse me for a second, fellas.

289
00:12:14,551 --> 00:12:15,759
We got a problem here?

290
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,511
I feel like I wanna be raw,

291
00:12:17,512 --> 00:12:21,265
but every time he does something cool,
he then does something really raw,

292
00:12:21,266 --> 00:12:22,432
and it kind of grosses me out.

293
00:12:22,433 --> 00:12:24,560
You don't like
that he's spitting in the dog food?

294
00:12:24,561 --> 00:12:27,771
No, I don't like that he expressed that
dog's anal glands with his bare hands.

295
00:12:27,772 --> 00:12:29,565
Yeah. But I mean, like, look, dude,

296
00:12:29,566 --> 00:12:31,775
you wanna be raw,
you gotta get your hands a little dirty.

297
00:12:31,776 --> 00:12:34,111
Well, you don't got to
'cause there's gloves right there.

298
00:12:34,112 --> 00:12:35,445
There were gloves right there,
weren't there?

299
00:12:37,282 --> 00:12:39,658
Take it easy. Okay, okay, okay.

300
00:12:39,659 --> 00:12:41,034
Well, he's got that dog in him.

301
00:12:41,035 --> 00:12:42,786
- Take it easy.
- He's going full dog on that guy, huh?

302
00:12:42,787 --> 00:12:44,414
Forget about it. Forget about it.

303
00:12:44,873 --> 00:12:47,457
Wow. That was intense, man. Whoa!

304
00:12:47,458 --> 00:12:49,334
Yeah, I'm sorry y'all had to see that,

305
00:12:49,335 --> 00:12:52,004
but sometimes I'm just off my leash
and protecting my pack.

306
00:12:52,005 --> 00:12:55,132
Yeah. Is that the... That's the one
you expressed the gland with.

307
00:12:56,217 --> 00:12:58,887
Now, this dog here is hurt.

308
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:02,414
He can't race no more.
That makes him mine now.

309
00:13:02,415 --> 00:13:03,599
So, you get to keep the dog?

310
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,310
Yeah, I get to take him home,
take care of him. I live right here.

311
00:13:06,311 --> 00:13:07,686
In the dog kennel?

312
00:13:07,687 --> 00:13:10,565
No, I wish. No, I live in a trailer
out in the parking lot.

313
00:13:12,233 --> 00:13:14,527
Come on, let's get out of here.

314
00:13:15,361 --> 00:13:17,530
Before this place makes animals of us all.

315
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:21,033
Ready, set, go!

316
00:13:29,209 --> 00:13:31,878
Keep going, keep going, keep going.

317
00:13:33,046 --> 00:13:34,213
Oh, no.

318
00:13:37,675 --> 00:13:39,426
Don't quit, don't quit, don't quit.

319
00:13:39,427 --> 00:13:41,511
They're not gonna make it.
They're not gonna make it, Frank.

320
00:13:41,512 --> 00:13:42,680
No, they're gonna make it.

321
00:13:43,389 --> 00:13:45,307
No, no. Gag, gag, don't quit.

322
00:13:45,308 --> 00:13:48,394
You haven't made your money back yet.
You haven't made your money back.

323
00:13:51,105 --> 00:13:52,564
You haven't made your money back.

324
00:13:52,565 --> 00:13:53,982
It's too much. It's too much.

325
00:13:53,983 --> 00:13:55,943
Okay, my sister and I are out of here.

326
00:13:55,944 --> 00:13:59,271
- You owe me 15K, Frank!
- Damn! Goddamn it.

327
00:13:59,272 --> 00:14:01,239
- Ten bucks says they stay.
- I'll take that.

328
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:03,825
No, no, no. No more bets, goddamn it!

329
00:14:03,826 --> 00:14:06,745
We've been degraded enough, Frank!
We're out of here.

330
00:14:06,746 --> 00:14:08,789
Not classy! Not classy, Frank!

331
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:11,166
Not classy! Not classy!

332
00:14:11,167 --> 00:14:12,585
Not classy!

333
00:14:13,795 --> 00:14:14,795
That was bad.

334
00:14:14,796 --> 00:14:16,880
It was just too far, Dee.

335
00:14:16,881 --> 00:14:18,632
He turned us into the dogs.

336
00:14:22,303 --> 00:14:23,345
You gotta stop, Dee.

337
00:14:23,346 --> 00:14:25,389
Trying to stop, but the smell
of dog food on your breath--

338
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:27,015
- Okay, listen, listen.
- It's really bad.

339
00:14:32,188 --> 00:14:33,939
I have a plan. I have a plan.

340
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:35,974
How we can get
our money back and then some.

341
00:14:35,975 --> 00:14:38,151
- Double or nothing for our clothes?
- No, no, no.

342
00:14:38,152 --> 00:14:40,487
We gotta be smarter than that, Dee!
We gotta be smarter.

343
00:14:40,488 --> 00:14:41,990
We can't play their games anymore, okay?

344
00:14:42,907 --> 00:14:45,575
We're gonna get our money back,
and we're gonna make even more money.

345
00:14:46,828 --> 00:14:49,372
But we're gonna have
to do something pretty raw.

346
00:14:55,211 --> 00:14:57,005
Come on, Sherlock Bones.
Let's go.

347
00:14:59,048 --> 00:15:02,050
Well... ...this is my kennel.

348
00:15:02,051 --> 00:15:03,468
Cool. Living at the dog track.

349
00:15:03,469 --> 00:15:05,470
- That's raw, dude.
- Yeah.

350
00:15:07,181 --> 00:15:08,683
Pardon the tarp, boys.

351
00:15:09,559 --> 00:15:11,476
Dogs get a little messy
every now and then.

352
00:15:11,477 --> 00:15:13,145
- Oh...
- And you're putting the dog's needs first.

353
00:15:13,146 --> 00:15:16,815
- Yeah, right. He's thinking about the dog.
- All day. Man, you have opened my eyes.

354
00:15:16,816 --> 00:15:19,860
You have spent your entire life giving,
and all I do is take.

355
00:15:19,861 --> 00:15:21,903
- Yeah, you're big taker.
- Yeah, I am. I'm a bit of a...

356
00:15:21,904 --> 00:15:23,238
You are too though.

357
00:15:23,239 --> 00:15:26,783
But look, I-I-I feel like being raw
is putting yourself last.

358
00:15:26,784 --> 00:15:27,869
And that's a good way to be.

359
00:15:28,369 --> 00:15:30,495
Yeah, dude. Put yourself last.

360
00:15:30,496 --> 00:15:33,790
And tarps, I mean, pretty awesome, man.
I might get a tarp for Frank.

361
00:15:33,791 --> 00:15:35,083
What kind of breed is Frank?

362
00:15:35,084 --> 00:15:37,627
Oh, Frank's a man.

363
00:15:37,628 --> 00:15:39,588
- He's a man, human man.
- Yeah, he's human man.

364
00:15:39,589 --> 00:15:41,548
- Human.
- But he's messy like a dog.

365
00:15:43,092 --> 00:15:44,384
But he's a man.

366
00:15:49,474 --> 00:15:50,474
Yeah. Anyways...

367
00:15:51,893 --> 00:15:54,019
Hey, listen, man,
just thanks again for everything.

368
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:55,520
It's been an awesome day, and...

369
00:15:55,521 --> 00:15:58,191
I'm... I'm really just so sorry
they're closing this place down.

370
00:15:59,525 --> 00:16:00,776
They're doing what now?

371
00:16:00,777 --> 00:16:04,404
Oh, you didn't hear?
Oh, this place is closing down, yeah.

372
00:16:04,405 --> 00:16:08,326
I think there's not gonna be
any more dog tracks in... in America.

373
00:16:11,079 --> 00:16:12,371
I did not know that.

374
00:16:14,707 --> 00:16:16,625
Think somebody would've told me.

375
00:16:16,626 --> 00:16:19,836
- Yeah.
- Oh, well,
I guess I'm always just the last to know.

376
00:16:21,422 --> 00:16:22,547
All right.

377
00:16:22,548 --> 00:16:27,552
Say, boys, you mind if I go spend
a couple of minutes with my thoughts here?

378
00:16:27,553 --> 00:16:31,557
Yeah, no. Go take... take a minute,
and we'll hang here and...

379
00:16:32,141 --> 00:16:35,060
- God, I feel bad that he didn't know.
- God, man. I feel so bad.

380
00:16:35,061 --> 00:16:37,020
I can't believe they would
keep him in the dark like that, man.

381
00:16:37,021 --> 00:16:39,689
You know what?
He's got such a great outlook on life.

382
00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:42,150
- I bet he bounces right back.
- He definitely will.

383
00:16:45,154 --> 00:16:46,404
That sounded like a gunshot, man.

384
00:16:46,405 --> 00:16:48,198
It did sound like a gunshot. Do...

385
00:16:48,199 --> 00:16:49,492
Do you think he shot the dog?

386
00:16:50,827 --> 00:16:52,410
- Why? Why would--
- I don't know.

387
00:16:52,411 --> 00:16:54,813
Maybe that's what he was talking about
when he says he takes care of the dogs,

388
00:16:54,814 --> 00:16:56,581
like, he shoots them
when they can't race anymore?

389
00:16:56,582 --> 00:16:58,375
- Is that a thing? That might be a thing.
- I don't know.

390
00:16:58,376 --> 00:17:00,919
That might be why they're shutting down
all... all of these places over the country.

391
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:03,131
- 'Cause they shoot the dogs when they--
- Yes.

392
00:17:06,643 --> 00:17:08,794
Well, if he didn't shoot the dog,
what did he shoot?

393
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:13,181
- Oh...
- Dude.

394
00:17:13,182 --> 00:17:15,226
He was feeling a little too raw.

395
00:17:18,437 --> 00:17:19,647
Hi.

396
00:17:20,231 --> 00:17:22,858
- This is a crime scene now, right? Yeah.
- This is a crime scene, yeah.

397
00:17:22,859 --> 00:17:24,860
- You know what, wipe our prints.
- Yeah.

398
00:17:24,861 --> 00:17:27,779
We're thinking the same thing.
We gotta wipe the prints.

399
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:30,490
Let's just get out of here, man.
Let's just get out of here.

400
00:17:30,491 --> 00:17:31,784
You wanna burn this thing down, or...

401
00:17:32,702 --> 00:17:33,702
<i>Go, go.</i>

402
00:17:33,703 --> 00:17:36,371
- Frank. Frank, we gotta go. Right now.
- There he is.

403
00:17:36,372 --> 00:17:37,747
We gotta go. we gotta go.

404
00:17:37,748 --> 00:17:39,202
There is a seedy underbelly to this place.

405
00:17:39,202 --> 00:17:41,751
- Maybe a bit of a fingerprints situation.
- It's not good. Bad things happened.

406
00:17:41,752 --> 00:17:43,086
There's definitely a fingerprint issue.

407
00:17:43,087 --> 00:17:44,754
- We gotta go, dude.
- We gotta go.

408
00:17:44,755 --> 00:17:47,049
We did it.

409
00:17:48,176 --> 00:17:49,759
- Bitch!
- Why are you dressed like this?

410
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:50,969
Move past that.

411
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:52,053
Yeah, not now, not now.

412
00:17:52,054 --> 00:17:53,763
We want our clothes. We want our money.

413
00:17:53,764 --> 00:17:56,600
And we want 50%
of whatever the Saudis were gonna pay you.

414
00:17:56,601 --> 00:17:59,561
- You did it?
- Oh, yeah, we did it, you son of a bitch.

415
00:17:59,562 --> 00:18:01,855
- Prove it.
- No problem.

416
00:18:01,856 --> 00:18:03,982
- I was hoping we weren't gonna show this.
- No, we're gonna do it.

417
00:18:03,983 --> 00:18:05,485
<i>- No, they're gonna see it.
- Here we go.</i>

418
00:18:06,777 --> 00:18:08,112
There we go. All right.

419
00:18:09,739 --> 00:18:10,740
Go.

420
00:18:12,074 --> 00:18:16,245
Hello, crown princes
and other honorable Saudis.

421
00:18:20,291 --> 00:18:23,711
With much respect,
we present to you Pennies From Heaven.

422
00:18:24,754 --> 00:18:26,630
Champion racing dog.

423
00:18:26,631 --> 00:18:31,219
Let this video serve as proof
to show authenticity.

424
00:18:32,386 --> 00:18:34,971
Oh, God. Okay, all right, here we go.

425
00:18:34,972 --> 00:18:36,056
<i>Yep.</i>

426
00:18:36,057 --> 00:18:37,891
<i>Yeah, get under him. Get underneath.</i>

427
00:18:37,892 --> 00:18:39,476
Oh, my God, man.

428
00:18:46,442 --> 00:18:48,110
- Oh, my God!
- Oh!

429
00:18:49,111 --> 00:18:50,320
Shit.

430
00:18:50,321 --> 00:18:54,575
They did it!
You owe me big time, Louis.

431
00:18:55,243 --> 00:18:56,493
I won.

432
00:18:59,539 --> 00:19:01,414
- Well done, Frank.
- Fork it over, baby.

433
00:19:01,415 --> 00:19:03,625
- Nice!
- Easy. Easy.

434
00:19:03,626 --> 00:19:06,461
- Oh, w-what's happening?
- I won.

435
00:19:06,462 --> 00:19:07,712
- You won what?
- The bet.

436
00:19:07,713 --> 00:19:10,757
I bet Louis I could get you guys
to jerk off a dog,

437
00:19:10,758 --> 00:19:12,634
and you did it.

438
00:19:12,635 --> 00:19:14,427
The Saudis. What about the Saudis?

439
00:19:14,428 --> 00:19:16,097
I don't know no Saudis.

440
00:19:16,973 --> 00:19:19,307
- I don't even own a dog.
- What are you talking about, Frank?

441
00:19:19,308 --> 00:19:22,936
The only reason why we're here is
so I can bet on you.

442
00:19:22,937 --> 00:19:25,605
You are my raw dogs, and you won.

443
00:19:25,606 --> 00:19:28,775
No, no, we're here because
you wanted to bet on the dog races.

444
00:19:28,776 --> 00:19:33,238
Dog races? I never bet on a dog race.
That's some low-class shit.

445
00:19:41,872 --> 00:19:44,750
