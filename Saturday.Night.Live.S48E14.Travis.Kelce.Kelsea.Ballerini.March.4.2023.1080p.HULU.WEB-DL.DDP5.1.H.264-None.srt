1
00:00:01,671 --> 00:00:04,858
>>> YOU'RE WATCHING "FOX AND
FRIENDS."

2
00:00:04,859 --> 00:00:07,605
>>> GOOD MORNING.

3
00:00:07,605 --> 00:00:11,085
WELCOME TO "FOX AND FRIENDS."
I'M STEVE DOOCY

4
00:00:11,085 --> 00:00:14,332
HERE WITH MY
GOOD FRIENDS BRIAN KILMEADE AND
AINSLEY EARHARDT.

5
00:00:14,332 --> 00:00:18,970
>> THANK YOU, STEVE, AS ALWAYS,
WE'RE COMING TO
YOU LIVE FROM NEW YORK CITY.

6
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:21,046
NEW YORK, WHAT A CESSPOOL.

7
00:00:21,142 --> 00:00:23,414
THAT'S A DEMOCRAT-RUN CITY FOR
YOU.

8
00:00:23,414 --> 00:00:27,435
>> I KNOW.
JUST TODAY I WAS PUSHED ON TO
THE SUBWAY TRACKS BY A HOMELESS MAN

9
00:00:27,435 --> 00:00:30,288
AND THEN PUSHED BACK ON THE
PLATFORM BY RATS.

10
00:00:30,288 --> 00:00:32,249
>> THAT'S TERRIBLE!

11
00:00:32,249 --> 00:00:36,297
WELL, YOU MAY HAVE HEARD THAT
FOX NEWS IS CURRENTLY FACING

12
00:00:36,297 --> 00:00:41,835
A $1.6 BILLION LAWSUIT FROM
DOMINION VOTING SYSTEMS.

13
00:00:41,835 --> 00:00:45,524
>> I'M SURPRISED.
I'M A FAN OF DA MINIONS.

14
00:00:45,524 --> 00:00:47,879
THE YELLOW GUYS IN THE OVERALLS.

15
00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:51,341
BANANA!

16
00:00:51,341 --> 00:00:53,739
>> NO, BRIAN, NOT THE MINIONS.

17
00:00:53,828 --> 00:00:57,793
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE DOMINION
VOTING MACHINES LAWSUIT

18
00:00:57,793 --> 00:01:02,762
AND OUR
BOSS RUPERT MURDOCH GAVE SOME
PRETTY SHOCKING TESTIMONY IN THE
CASE.

19
00:01:02,762 --> 00:01:06,879
>> THIS WHOLE TRIAL HAS BEEN SO
UNFAIR.
THEY ARE RAKING HIM OVER THE
COALS.

20
00:01:06,965 --> 00:01:09,911
RUPERT MURDOCH WOULD NEVER
MURDER ANYONE.

21
00:01:09,911 --> 00:01:13,245
>> WHAT?
>> THEY SENT HIM AWAY FOR LIFE.

22
00:01:13,245 --> 00:01:16,099
LOOK HOW SAD HE LOOKS.
WHERE'S THAT PICTURE I FOUND OF
HIM?

23
00:01:16,099 --> 00:01:19,929
>> THAT'S NOT RUPERT MURDOCH.

24
00:01:19,929 --> 00:01:22,147
THAT'S ALEX MURDAUGH.

25
00:01:22,148 --> 00:01:26,485
WRONG GUY

26
00:01:26,485 --> 00:01:29,051
EXPLAIN LATER

27
00:01:29,051 --> 00:01:31,860
ANYWAY, RUPERT MURDOCH ADMITTED

28
00:01:31,946 --> 00:01:36,818
FOX NEWS AIRED ELECTION FRAUD CONSPIRACIES
TO GET RATINGS

29
00:01:36,818 --> 00:01:39,799
EVEN
THOUGH EVERYONE HERE KNEW THEY
WERE FALSE.

30
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:42,441
>> UH-OH, I DIDN'T.
LOOP A BROTHER IN NEXT TIME.

31
00:01:42,503 --> 00:01:45,588
>> NOW, YOU MAY BE WONDERING IF
IT'S SUCH A BIG STORY

32
00:01:45,588 --> 00:01:47,603
WHY
HAVEN'T I HEARD ABOUT IT ON FOX?

33
00:01:47,603 --> 00:01:51,131
>> I THINK IT'S BECAUSE THEY'RE
SUING US FOR $1.6 BILLION

34
00:01:51,131 --> 00:01:54,029
>> NO.
IT'S BECAUSE IT'S COMPLETE BS.

35
00:01:54,029 --> 00:01:57,945
THE MEDIA IS TAKING TWEETS

36
00:01:57,945 --> 00:02:00,828
AND PUTTING THEM COMPLETELY OUT OF
CONTEXT.

37
00:02:00,828 --> 00:02:02,662
>> LIKE THIS ONE.

38
00:02:02,744 --> 00:02:05,874
RUDY GIULIANI IS INSANE.

39
00:02:05,874 --> 00:02:11,153
HOW COULD YOU LEAVE OUT THE
REST?
IT'S RUDY GIULIANI IS INSANELY
HOT.

40
00:02:11,153 --> 00:02:13,948
I WANT TO LICK THAT HEAD DYE
RIGHT OFF.

41
00:02:13,948 --> 00:02:16,894
>> WHO WOULDN'T?

42
00:02:16,894 --> 00:02:19,615
AND SOME MESSAGES THEY SHOWED AT THE TRIAL

43
00:02:19,692 --> 00:02:22,414
DIDN'T RELATE TO THE
LAWSUIT AT ALL.

44
00:02:22,414 --> 00:02:26,728
FOR EXAMPLE, THE TEXT, MIND
BLOWINGLY-NUTS,

45
00:02:26,728 --> 00:02:29,860
OFF THE RAILS,
AND F'ing LUNATIC

46
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:33,374
WERE ALL SENT
IN RESPONSE TO LAURA INGRAM'S TEXT,

47
00:02:33,374 --> 00:02:35,920
WHAT SHOULD I PUT IN MY
TINDER BIO?

48
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:39,348
>> YOU GO, GIRL.

49
00:02:39,349 --> 00:02:41,576
ALL RIGHT

50
00:02:41,577 --> 00:02:44,839
GUEST
APPEARANCE ON FOX

51
00:02:44,839 --> 00:02:47,020
WERE
TRIAL.

52
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:51,698
FOX NEWS
ADVERTISER

53
00:02:51,698 --> 00:02:54,697
MYPILLOW

54
00:02:54,697 --> 00:02:57,170
HELLO

55
00:02:57,170 --> 00:03:01,940
I'M DOWN AT CPAC RIGHT NOW,
AND IT IS AN ABSOLUTE BLAST.

56
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:04,537
I WAS JUST OVER AT THE BIDEN DID
YOU THINK TANK.

57
00:03:04,537 --> 00:03:08,418
IT'S NOT THE REAL BIDEN YOU DID
YOU THINK, BUT THE ACTOR IS JUST AS OLD,

58
00:03:08,511 --> 00:03:12,537
SO YOU NEVER KNOW IF
HE'S COMING BACK UP.
THERE'S REAL RISK THERE.

59
00:03:12,537 --> 00:03:15,020
>> THAT'S GREAT.
WE'RE GLAD TO HAVE YOU ON,

60
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:17,911
BUT
BECAUSE OF THIS LAWSUIT, OUR
LAWYERS HAVE ASKED YOU

61
00:03:17,985 --> 00:03:20,587
PLEASE
DON'T SAY ANYTHING CRAZY ABOUT
DOMINION.

62
00:03:20,587 --> 00:03:24,379
>> NO PROBLEM.
I HAVE BEEN BRIEFED.
I KNOW THE RULES.

63
00:03:24,379 --> 00:03:29,621
EVERY DOMINION MACHINE HAS A
VENEZUELAN OOMPAH LOOMPAH INSIDE

64
00:03:29,621 --> 00:03:32,506
THAT EATS THE VOTES WITH ITS
LITTLE MOUTH.

65
00:03:32,572 --> 00:03:36,221
>> MIKE, GOT TO CUT YOU OFF
THERE, PAL.

66
00:03:36,221 --> 00:03:38,979
WE CAN'T BE SAYING WHATEVER
ANYMORE.

67
00:03:38,979 --> 00:03:42,462
>> OF COURSE.
LET ME CHOOSE MY WORDS
CAREFULLY.

68
00:03:42,462 --> 00:03:47,601
DOMINION VOTING MACHINES GIVE
TRIPLE VOTES TO DEMOCRATS, ILLEGALS

69
00:03:47,601 --> 00:03:50,721
AND THAT LADY M&M THAT
STOPPED SHAVING HER PITS.

70
00:03:50,721 --> 00:03:54,585
>> MIKE!
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO END IT
THERE.

71
00:03:54,585 --> 00:03:56,476
>> THAT'S PROBABLY FOR THE BEST.

72
00:03:56,476 --> 00:03:59,229
I HAVE TO SAY THIS WHOLE
DOMINION THING HAS BEEN A NIGHTMARE

73
00:03:59,229 --> 00:04:03,201
FOR ME AND MY FAMILY,
ESPECIALLY MY WIFE.

74
00:04:03,552 --> 00:04:07,462
SORRY, PILLOWMINA, YOU KNOW IT'S
TRUE.

75
00:04:07,462 --> 00:04:11,907
>> ALL RIGHT.
WELL, LET'S TAKE A BREAK.

76
00:04:11,907 --> 00:04:15,849
WHEN WE COME BACK, WE'LL TALK
MORE ABOUT THE ALEX MURDAUGH SENTENCING

77
00:04:15,849 --> 00:04:20,535
WITH OUR FOX CRIME
EXPERT, O.J. SIMPSON.

78
00:04:20,535 --> 00:04:25,548
>> WHAT?
MAN, I DON'T KNOW WHY EVERYBODY
THINKS I'M AN EXPERT ON THIS.

79
00:04:25,548 --> 00:04:28,778
SHOOT, BOOKING ME ON THE SHOW
WITHOUT TELLING ME WHY.

80
00:04:28,778 --> 00:04:31,727
MAKES ME SO MAD I COULD JUST --

81
00:04:34,272 --> 00:04:36,874
NAH, I'M OKAY.

82
00:04:36,874 --> 00:04:41,134
AND HEY, MAN, LIVE FROM NEW
YORK, IT'S SATURDAY NIGHT.
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

83
00:06:42,674 --> 00:06:47,686
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, TRAVIS
KELCE!

84
00:07:12,341 --> 00:07:17,401
YOU SO VERY MUCH.

85
00:07:17,401 --> 00:07:18,685
IT'S GREAT TO BE HERE.

86
00:07:18,685 --> 00:07:24,023
AND IF YOU DON'T KNOW, I JUST
WON MY SECOND SUPER BOWL.

87
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:27,067
OH, MAN.

88
00:07:27,067 --> 00:07:30,732
WHICH WAS AMAZING.
BUT FOR ME, HOSTING SNL

89
00:07:30,732 --> 00:07:34,629
IS THAT
MUCH BETTER, BABY.

90
00:07:34,629 --> 00:07:38,133
I'M LYING TO YOU ALL.
I'M LYING.
I'M KIDDING.

91
00:07:38,133 --> 00:07:40,457
WINNING THE SUPER BOWL WAS WAY
BETTER.

92
00:07:40,555 --> 00:07:42,421
BUT SERIOUSLY.

93
00:07:45,578 --> 00:07:48,974
SERIOUSLY, I'M HONORED THAT SNL
ASKED ME TO HOST.

94
00:07:48,974 --> 00:07:51,081
I WAS NERVOUS ABOUT DOING A
MONOLOGUE,

95
00:07:51,081 --> 00:07:54,447
BUT THEN I
REMEMBERED, I'M PRETTY GOOD WITH
WORDS.

96
00:07:54,447 --> 00:07:57,207
I'M PRETTY GOOD WITH WORDS, LIKE
DURING GAMES,

97
00:07:57,272 --> 00:08:00,512
I DO THESE SUPER
ELOQUENT PUMP-UP SPEECHES FOR MY
TEAMMATES.

98
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:01,396
PLEASE WATCH.

99
00:08:01,396 --> 00:08:14,451
MORE, MORE, MORE, MORE, MORE,
MORE, MORE, MORE, MORE, MORE.

100
00:08:14,918 --> 00:08:18,221
AND SOMETIMES I EVEN DO IT IN MY
PAT MAHOMES VOICE,

101
00:08:18,326 --> 00:08:23,393
MORE, MORE,
DO IT, DO IT.

102
00:08:24,375 --> 00:08:25,584
LOVE YOU, PAT.

103
00:08:25,584 --> 00:08:28,528
PROBABLY THE COOLEST THING ABOUT
THIS SUPER BOWL

104
00:08:28,594 --> 00:08:31,642
IS THAT MY WHOLE
FAMILY WAS THERE.

105
00:08:35,503 --> 00:08:39,694
I GOT TO PLAY AGAINST MY BROTHER
JASON, WHO IS AN EAGLE.

106
00:08:42,096 --> 00:08:46,197
AND MY MOM WAS ON TV MORE THAN
BOTH OF US.

107
00:08:49,264 --> 00:08:53,625
MY MOM, DAD, AND BROTHER ARE ALL
HERE TONIGHT.

108
00:08:59,284 --> 00:09:01,161
YOU KNOW, PEOP KEEP ASKING ME

109
00:09:01,161 --> 00:09:05,244
WHAT IT WAS LIKE TO BEAT MY
BROTHER IN THE SUPER BOWL,

110
00:09:05,244 --> 00:09:09,128
AND
IT WAS PRETTY AWKWARD.

111
00:09:09,128 --> 00:09:12,997
ESPECIALLY BECAUSE AFTER THE
GAME, WE HAD TO RIDE HOME
TOGETHER.

112
00:09:12,997 --> 00:09:15,680
OUR MOM DROVE US THERE IN HER MINI VAN,

113
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,307
JUST LIKE THE GOOD OLD
DAYS.

114
00:09:18,326 --> 00:09:22,392
EVEN THOUGH HIS TEAM LOST AFTER
BEING UP TEN POINTS AT HALF,

115
00:09:22,392 --> 00:09:26,587
MY
BROTHER IS ACTUALLY REALLY HAPPY
FOR ME.

116
00:09:29,649 --> 00:09:34,238
AND HE AGREES THAT THE REF MADE
THE RIGHT CALL.
IT WAS A HOLDING.

117
00:09:40,566 --> 00:09:44,244
JASON AND I HAVE BEEN PLAYING
FOOTBALL TOGETHER SINCE WE WERE
LITTLE KIDS.

118
00:09:44,244 --> 00:09:47,505
AND HE WAS ALWAYS BETTER THAN
ME -- AT EVERYTHING.

119
00:09:47,577 --> 00:09:50,600
IN HIGH SCHOOL, HE WAS AN HONOR STUDENT,

120
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:54,199
AND I GOT KICKED OFF
THE TEAM BECAUSE I FAILED FRENCH,

121
00:09:54,199 --> 00:09:58,087
AND ENGLISH TOO, BUT
FRENCH SOUNDS WAY BETTER.

122
00:09:58,087 --> 00:10:01,875
AND THEN, WHEN WE WERE IN
COLLEGE, I ACTUALLY GOT KICKED OFF THE TEAM

123
00:10:01,875 --> 00:10:03,427
BECAUSE I TESTED
POSITIVE FOR MARIJUANA.

124
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:06,819
SO IT JUST GOES TO SHOW YOU, IF
YOU SMOKE WEED AND ARE BAD AT SCHOOL,

125
00:10:06,819 --> 00:10:09,741
YOU CAN WIN THE SUPER
BOWL TWICE.

126
00:10:17,943 --> 00:10:20,827
THIS ISN'T MY FIRST TIME HOSTING
A TV SHOW.

127
00:10:20,827 --> 00:10:23,367
I ACTUALLY HAD MY OWN DATES SHOW ON E

128
00:10:23,367 --> 00:10:26,348
CALLED CATCHING KELCE.

129
00:10:27,854 --> 00:10:32,934
IT WAS LIKE THE BACHELOR EXCEPT
INSTEAD OF HANDING OUT ROSES, I
HANDED OUT FOOTBALLS,

130
00:10:32,934 --> 00:10:36,310
AND
INSTEAD OF WATCHING, PEOPLE DID
NOT.

131
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:38,809
WHICH WAS A LITTLE BIT
EMBARRASSING.

132
00:10:38,809 --> 00:10:42,604
BUT I HAVE TO SAY, I GOT PRETTY
GOOD AT REALITY TV.

133
00:10:42,604 --> 00:10:44,451
CHECK THIS ONE OUT.

134
00:10:44,451 --> 00:10:46,942
WHAT DO WE NAME THIS?

135
00:10:46,942 --> 00:10:49,941
>> STANLEY.

136
00:10:51,622 --> 00:10:55,784
>> AVERY IS HYSTERICAL.

137
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:01,776
RIGHT?

138
00:11:03,799 --> 00:11:07,871
THAT SHOW IS OWNED BY NBC
UNIVERSAL, SO IT SHOULD BE ON PEACOCK,

139
00:11:07,957 --> 00:11:10,775
BUT PEACOCK SAID, NAH,
WE GOOD.

140
00:11:15,728 --> 00:11:18,129
I KNEW SOMETHING WOULD MAKE HIM
SMILE.

141
00:11:18,129 --> 00:11:23,217
BUT REALLY, IT'S COOL TO BE
HERE.
I GREW UP WATCHING SNL WITH MY
MOTHER.

142
00:11:23,217 --> 00:11:26,208
I LOVE FARRELL, THE SANDMAN CHRIS FARLEY,

143
00:11:26,208 --> 00:11:28,578
AND TO BE STANDING ON THIS STAGE,

144
00:11:29,846 --> 00:11:31,988
WHEW, PRETTY
SURREAL.

145
00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:37,004
AND TONIGHT, I'M GOING TO GIVE
IT EVERYTHING I GOT.

146
00:11:42,961 --> 00:11:45,531
AS A WISE MAN ONCE SAID,

147
00:11:45,531 --> 00:11:48,882
MORE, MORE, MORE, MORE, MORE AND MORE!

148
00:11:48,882 --> 00:11:54,386
WE GOT A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU
TONIGHT!

313
00:17:34,085 --> 00:17:36,859
YOU'RE SEARCHING FOR CONFIDENCE.

314
00:17:36,859 --> 00:17:39,824
THE CONFIDENCE OF NOT ONLY
KNOWING YOU CAN DEFEND YOURSELF,

315
00:17:39,824 --> 00:17:43,833
BUT THAT YOU'RE SOMEBODY WORTH

YOU, GET UP HERE.

319
00:17:53,673 --> 00:17:56,779
WHAT'S YOUR NAME, SON?
>> JOHN.

320
00:17:56,779 --> 00:17:59,570
>> OH, JOHN, I CAN HEAR IT IN
YOUR VOICE.

321
00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:02,659
YOU FEEL SMALL, DON'T YOU, SON?
>> YES.

322
00:18:02,659 --> 00:18:05,367
>> YOU GOT TO OWN IT, SON, OWN
YOUR TRUTH.

323
00:18:05,472 --> 00:18:07,831

>> BUT YOU'RE NOT SMALL.

324
00:18:07,831 --> 00:18:10,646
PUT YOUR HANDS UP.
I AM GOING TO STRIKE,

325
00:18:10,646 --> 00:18:15,608
AND WHEN I
STRIKE, YOU DEFLECT, AND I WANT YOU TO HIT ME BACK,

326
00:18:15,608 --> 00:18:18,751
AND WHEN YOU
DO, IMAGINE I'M THE VOICE IN YOUR HEAD

327
00:18:18,819 --> 00:18:20,905
TELLING YOU YOU AREN'T
WORTH IT.

328
00:18:20,905 --> 00:18:22,927
BECAUSE WHAT ARE YOU?
>> I AM WORTH IT!

329
00:18:23,022 --> 00:18:25,417

WHO'S NEXT?

332
00:18:29,761 --> 00:18:31,967

WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT TO HIM?

333
00:18:31,967 --> 00:18:34,363
>> YOU'RE NEXT.
>> I'M --

334
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:38,858
>> WHY ARE YOU SO AFRAID, SON?
>> YOU PUNCHED MY FRIEND, AND
I'M WORRIED HE'S DEAD.

335
00:18:38,858 --> 00:18:42,991
>> YOU'RE AFRAID YOUR FATHER WAS
RIGHT.

336
00:18:42,991 --> 00:18:45,548
>> I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT
HIM.
>> THAT'S NOT AN OPTION

337
00:18:45,548 --> 00:18:49,425
BECAUSE
YOUR FATHER WAS WRONG.
>> KURT, PLEASE.

338
00:18:49,425 --> 00:18:52,881
>> YOU ARE A MAN, AND I NEED YOU
TO TELL HIM.

339
00:18:52,881 --> 00:18:56,018
>> HOW?
>> CLOSE YOUR EYES.

340
00:18:58,164 --> 00:19:00,565
>> DIDN'T STAND A CHANCE, BUCKO!

341
00:19:00,565 --> 00:19:03,241
HE REALLY CLOSED HIS EYES.

342
00:19:04,571 --> 00:19:06,797
>> IS THIS WHAT THE CLASS IS?

343
00:19:06,824 --> 00:19:09,684
>> YOU HAVE BEEN SCARED YOUR
WHOLE LIFE.
>> OH, NO.

344
00:19:09,684 --> 00:19:12,002
>> YOU LOST YOUR MOTHER AT A
YOUNG AGE.
>> THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN.

345
00:19:12,002 --> 00:19:15,449
>> BECAUSE YOUR FATHER WASN'T
THERE TO PROTECT HER.
>> YOU'RE MAKING STUFF UP, MAN.

346
00:19:15,449 --> 00:19:19,415
>> AND I'M HERE TO SHOW YOU A
MAN CAN DEFEND THE ONES HE
LOVES.

347
00:19:19,415 --> 00:19:23,273
I WANT YOU TO PUNCH THIS WOMAN
RIGHT HERE.

348
00:19:23,366 --> 00:19:24,704
>> NO WAY.

349
00:19:24,704 --> 00:19:27,121
>> AND I WILL DEFLECT YOUR
STRIKE.

350
00:19:27,121 --> 00:19:28,448
>> WHY ARE WE DOING THIS?

351
00:19:28,448 --> 00:19:32,795
>> BECAUSE I WANT TO SHOW YOU A
REAL MAN DEFENDS THE WOMAN HE
LOVES.

352
00:19:32,795 --> 00:19:35,186
>> BUT YOU'RE POSITIVE YOU WILL
BLOCK IT?
>> ABSOLUTELY.

353
00:19:35,186 --> 00:19:37,442
>> BECAUSE IF I HIT THIS WOMAN,
SHE WILL DIE.

354
00:19:37,442 --> 00:19:39,559
>> PUNCH HER OR I'M GOING TO
PUNCH YOU.
>> OKAY.
YOU GOT IT.

355
00:19:39,559 --> 00:19:42,740
>> NICE TRY, BITCH.
>> OH, MY GOD.

356
00:19:45,204 --> 00:19:47,312
>> BOOM, SHELLY, YOU DID THAT
DAMN THING.

357
00:19:47,312 --> 00:19:50,818
>> DID A REVOLVER COME OUT OF
YOUR PANTS?
WHY DO YOU HAVE THIS?

358
00:19:50,818 --> 00:19:53,856
>> BECAUSE I LIVE IN FEAR.
WHY DO YOU THINK I'M IN THIS
CLASS?

359
00:19:53,929 --> 00:19:55,632
>> GIVE ME THAT.

360
00:19:56,913 --> 00:20:00,003
>> YOU WANT TO PLAY A GAME?
>> WHAT?

361
00:20:02,106 --> 00:20:04,676
RUSSIAN ROULETTE?

362
00:20:06,894 --> 00:20:09,046
>> FEELING LUCKY, SLICK?

363
00:20:09,046 --> 00:20:11,600
>> COME ON, DON'T DO IT!

364
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,633
>> ARE YOU OKAY?

365
00:20:14,633 --> 00:20:16,381
OH, MY GOD.

366
00:20:19,943 --> 00:20:24,403
>> GREAT WORK, GUYS.

ME, MY NAME IS DYLAN.

378
00:21:07,337 --> 00:21:09,770
I WAS GLENDA'S NURSE, AND WE HAD

00:21:09,772 --> 00:21:11,839
AN INTIMATE LOVING RELATIONSHIP

380
00:21:11,841 --> 00:21:13,240
IN HER FINAL MONTHS.

381
00:21:13,242 --> 00:21:14,375
>> WAIT.

>> I KNOW HOW IMPORTANT GLENDA

386
00:21:21,751 --> 00:21:23,584

SERVICE IN HER HONOR.

389
00:21:29,492 --> 00:21:31,926
IF YOU KNEW GLENDA, YOU KNEW SHE

390
00:21:31,928 --> 00:21:32,660
WAS A FREE SPIRIT.

391

>> YEAH, WHAT YOU MEAN BY THAT?

392
00:21:34,464 --> 00:21:36,697

00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:45,949
LIKE MOST GAY MEN, I HAVE A LOT
OF STRAIGHT FEMALE FRIENDS,

480
00:24:45,949 --> 00:24:48,093
AND I LOVE MY GIRLIES,

481
00:24:48,093 --> 00:24:51,029
BUT THEY CAN
BE A LOT, BOTH FINANCIALLY.

482
00:24:51,103 --> 00:24:54,339
>> WAIT, CARSON, YOU'RE COMING
TO TULUM, RIGHT?
>> YOU KNOW IT, SIS.

483
00:24:54,339 --> 00:24:56,079
AND EMOTIONALLY.

484
00:24:56,079 --> 00:25:00,386
>> TULUM IS WHERE DYLAN AND I
WERE SUPPOSED TO GO BEFORE WE
BROKE UP.

485
00:25:00,386 --> 00:25:02,987
>> I'M SO SORRY, BABE.

486
00:25:02,987 --> 00:25:06,678
AS MUCH AS THESE GIRLS MEAN TO
ME, SOMETIMES I NEED A BREAK.

487
00:25:06,678 --> 00:25:10,014
THAT'S WHEN I DISCOVERED,
STRAIGHT MALE FRIEND.

488
00:25:10,014 --> 00:25:14,036
>> WHAT'S UP?
YO, WATCH ME HEAD CHOP THIS
BITCH.

489
00:25:14,036 --> 00:25:16,848
BOOM TO THE DOOM.

490
00:25:16,848 --> 00:25:18,461
>> AMAZING.

491
00:25:18,461 --> 00:25:22,007
STRAIGHT MALE FRIEND IS A
LOW-EFFORT, LOW-STAKES RELATIONSHIP

492
00:25:22,007 --> 00:25:25,664
THAT REQUIRES NO
EMOTIONAL COMMITMENT, NO
FINANCIAL INVESTMENT,

493
00:25:25,664 --> 00:25:28,927
AND OTHER
THAN THE OCCASIONAL VIDEO GAME
OUTBURST --

494
00:25:28,927 --> 00:25:30,928
>> THIS GAME'S STUPID!

495
00:25:30,928 --> 00:25:32,169
>> -- NO DRAMA.

496
00:25:32,169 --> 00:25:33,992
>> YO, YOU WANT TO GO GET WINGS?

497
00:25:33,992 --> 00:25:36,688
>> IF I DIDN'T CHECK IN WITH MY
GAL PALS EVERY DAY OR TWO,

498
00:25:36,688 --> 00:25:38,512
IT WOULD
BECOME A WHOLE THING.

499
00:25:38,513 --> 00:25:40,773
NO

500
00:25:40,773 --> 00:25:43,459
HANG OUT AS LITTLE OR AS MUCH AS
YOU WANT.

501
00:25:43,459 --> 00:25:45,317
IT WON'T AFFECT THE FRIENDSHIP
AT ALL.

502
00:25:45,317 --> 00:25:46,471
WATCH THIS.

503
00:25:46,471 --> 00:25:50,237
HEY, I MIGHT BE MOVING TO EUROPE
FOR SEVEN YEARS.

504
00:25:50,237 --> 00:25:53,892
>> DOPE.
JUST HIT ME WHEN YOU'RE BACK.

505
00:25:53,892 --> 00:25:56,622
STRAIGHT MALE FRIEND IS EASY,

506
00:25:56,622 --> 00:26:00,540
AND EVEN IF HE'S HAVING A TOUGH
TIME EMOTIONALLY, HE'LL NEVER
BRING ME INTO IT.

507
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:02,727
YOU OKAY?
YOU SEEM A LITTLE UPSET.

508
00:26:02,727 --> 00:26:06,917
>> MAN, MY DAD DIED LAST WEEK.

509
00:26:10,438 --> 00:26:12,467
>> BUT IT'S ALL RIGHT.
YOU KNOW?

510
00:26:12,467 --> 00:26:14,616
>> YOU WANT TO GET SOME WINGS?
>> YEAH.

511
00:26:14,616 --> 00:26:17,138
STRAIGHT MALE FRIEND ISN'T PERFECT

512
00:26:17,138 --> 00:26:19,839
AND MAY ASK BLUNT
QUESTIONS ABOUT YOUR SEX LIFE.

513
00:26:19,839 --> 00:26:23,144
>> SO DO GAY GUYS LIKE WHEN A
GUY HAS A BIG ONE,

514
00:26:23,144 --> 00:26:25,796
OR IS IT A
BAD THING?

515
00:26:25,796 --> 00:26:27,592
>> DEPENDS ON THE GUY.

516
00:26:27,592 --> 00:26:30,821
BUT HE'S ONLY ASKING BECAUSE
HE'S HONESTLY CURIOUS,

517
00:26:30,821 --> 00:26:32,257
AND
THERE'S SOMETHING SWEET ABOUT
THAT.

518
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:37,243
DOES STRAIGHT MALE FRIEND
PROVIDE THE SAME DEEP REWARDING
RELATIONSHIP I HAVE WITH MY
GIRLS?

519
00:26:37,243 --> 00:26:38,207
NO.

520
00:26:38,207 --> 00:26:40,514
DOES STRAIGHT MALE FRIEND KNOW
MY LAST NAME?

521
00:26:40,590 --> 00:26:41,433
NO.

522
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:43,164
THAT'S KIND OF THE BEAUTY OF
IT.

523
00:26:43,164 --> 00:26:46,353
BUT IF YOU ARE MISSING A LITTLE
DRAMA, JUST SAY THIS.

524
00:26:46,353 --> 00:26:48,811
I BET I'M FASTER THAN YOU.

525
00:26:48,811 --> 00:26:53,404
>> DOG, BRO, FOR REAL?
YOU THINK YOU'RE FASTER THAN ME?

526
00:26:53,497 --> 00:26:57,685
I WILL GO OUTSIDE ON THE STREET
AND DUST YOUR ASS RIGHT NOW.

527
00:26:57,685 --> 00:27:00,064
LET'S GO.
COME ON.

528
00:27:00,064 --> 00:27:02,138
>> SO IF YOU'RE A GAY MAN WHO NEEDS A BREAK,

529
00:27:02,138 --> 00:27:06,894
COME ENJOY THE
CASUAL RELATIONSHIP GAY WOMEN
HAVE KNOWN ABOUT FOR YEARS.

530
00:27:06,894 --> 00:27:08,173
STRAIGHT MALE FRIEND.

531
00:27:08,173 --> 00:27:11,776
>> SORRY FOR BEING A PUSSY ABOUT
MY DAD DYING EARLIER.

532
00:27:11,776 --> 00:27:13,623
THAT WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN.

533
00:27:13,623 --> 00:27:16,438
>> STRAIGHT MALE FRIEND,
AVAILABLE EVERYWHERE.

534
00:27:16,438 --> 00:27:18,164
EXCEPT THERAPY.

535
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:31,532
>>> OKAY.

536
00:27:31,534 --> 00:27:33,200
THAT MOVIE WAS WILD.

537
00:27:33,202 --> 00:27:34,268
>> YEAH, "PADDINGTON 3" WAS NOT

538
00:27:34,270 --> 00:27:35,903
WHAT I EXPECTED.

539
00:27:35,905 --> 00:27:38,038
>> THAT WAS "COCAINE BEAR."

540
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:38,639
>> OKAY.

541
00:27:38,641 --> 00:27:39,239
I WAS SO WORRIED ABOUT

542
00:27:39,241 --> 00:27:41,809
PADDINGTON.

543
00:27:41,811 --> 00:27:44,511
>> SHOOT, ABBY, GRAHAM IS HERE.

544
00:27:44,513 --> 00:27:46,647
>> ABBY, WE CAN TOTALLY LEAVE.

545
00:27:46,649 --> 00:27:48,782
>> LOOK, Y'ALL, IT'S BEEN THREE

546
00:27:48,784 --> 00:27:52,219
YEARS, I CAN BE AROUND MY EX.

547
00:27:52,221 --> 00:27:55,556
M TOTALLY COOL.

548
00:27:55,558 --> 00:27:56,056
HEY, STRANGER.

549
00:27:56,058 --> 00:27:58,192
HOW ARE YOU, BUBBA?

550
00:27:58,194 --> 00:27:59,827
>> WHOA, ABBY, IS BEEN A

551
00:27:59,829 --> 00:28:00,360
MINUTE.

552
00:28:00,362 --> 00:28:02,496
WHAT'S NEW?

553
00:28:02,498 --> 00:28:04,098
>> I'M ACTUALLY IN THE BEST

554
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:08,502
PLACE I HAVE BEEN IN A LONG

555
00:28:08,504 --> 00:28:08,802
TIME.

556
00:28:08,804 --> 00:28:10,504
I'M WITH SOMEONE NEW, AND LIFE

557
00:28:10,506 --> 00:28:11,505
IS PRETTY RAD.

558
00:28:11,507 --> 00:28:12,706
HOW HAVE YOU BEEN?

559
00:28:12,708 --> 00:28:14,508
YOU LOOK LIKE HELL.

560
00:28:14,510 --> 00:28:15,576
JUST KIDDING.

561
00:28:15,578 --> 00:28:16,710
YOU LOOK AWESOME.

562
00:28:16,712 --> 00:28:18,779
>> OH, YEAH, I'VE BEEN GOOD.

563
00:28:18,781 --> 00:28:19,847
WORKING OUT A LOT.

564
00:28:19,849 --> 00:28:23,617
OH, AND THANKS FOR PAYING ME

565
00:28:23,619 --> 00:28:25,018
BACK ABOUT MY CAR GETTING FIXED.

566
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:25,486
>> YEAH.

567
00:28:25,488 --> 00:28:26,620
SORRY I THREW THAT KETTLE BELL

568
00:28:26,622 --> 00:28:28,756
THROUGH YOUR WINDSHIELD.

569
00:28:28,758 --> 00:28:29,857
I HAD A LOT TO PROCESS, BUT NOW

570
00:28:29,859 --> 00:28:35,129
I CAN LOOK AT YOU WITH NO

571
00:28:35,131 --> 00:28:36,797
ATTACHMENT, AND I THINK THAT'S

572
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:38,165
PRETTY FREAKING RAD.

573
00:28:38,167 --> 00:28:38,632
>> SORRY, BABE.

574
00:28:38,634 --> 00:28:39,333
THE LINE FOR THE BATHROOM WAS

575
00:28:39,335 --> 00:28:40,234
CRAZ

576
00:28:40,236 --> 00:28:42,369
>> HI, BABE.

577
00:28:42,371 --> 00:28:42,903
THIS IS MADISON.

578
00:28:42,905 --> 00:28:48,408
>> OH, YOU TWO ARE TOGETHER.

579
00:28:48,410 --> 00:28:48,776
CONGRATS.

580
00:28:48,778 --> 00:28:50,911
YOU GOT YOURSELF A STUNNING

581
00:28:50,913 --> 00:28:51,311
GIRLFRIEND.

582
00:28:51,313 --> 00:28:53,347
>> THIS IS MY FIANCE.

583
00:28:53,349 --> 00:28:53,747
>> YOUR --

584
00:28:53,749 --> 00:28:55,949
>> ABBY, ARE YOU CRYING?

585
00:28:55,951 --> 00:28:56,583
>> NO.

586
00:28:56,585 --> 00:28:58,318
REMEMBER I JUST HAD THAT THING

587
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,888
WITH MY EYES WHERE I HAVE TO

588
00:29:00,890 --> 00:29:01,321
POKE AT THEM.

589
00:29:01,323 --> 00:29:01,755
>> I DON'T.

590
00:29:01,757 --> 00:29:02,923
BUT IF YOU SAY SO.

591
00:29:02,925 --> 00:29:04,525
>> YEAH, YEAH.

592
00:29:04,527 --> 00:29:07,494
SO HOW DID YOU TWO MEET?

593
00:29:07,496 --> 00:29:09,196
>> WE MET ON A LITTLE CRUISE.

594
00:29:09,198 --> 00:29:12,399
>> WELL, IT WASN'T A CRUISE FOR

595
00:29:12,401 --> 00:29:13,433
ME.

596
00:29:13,435 --> 00:29:17,137
I'M A BOSUN ON BELOW DECK.

597
00:29:17,139 --> 00:29:18,806
>> THAT'S MY DREAM JOB.

598
00:29:18,808 --> 00:29:20,207
>> ABBY, ARE YOU OKAY?

599
00:29:20,209 --> 00:29:22,176
>> IT'S THE EYE THING AGAIN.

600
00:29:22,178 --> 00:29:23,110
I'M FINE.

601
00:29:23,112 --> 00:29:24,778
I MIGHT JUST HAVE TO HOLD THEM.

602
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:27,014
YOU GUYS CAN KISS IF YOU WANT.

603
00:29:27,016 --> 00:29:29,449
I DON'T GIVE A RAT'S ASS.

604
00:29:29,451 --> 00:29:31,185
>> WE'RE REALLY NOT TRYING TO

605
00:29:31,187 --> 00:29:33,587
KISS AT THIS MOMENT.

606
00:29:33,589 --> 00:29:38,559
>> SO HOW DO YOU GUYS KNOW EACH

607
00:29:38,561 --> 00:29:38,859
OTHER?

608
00:29:38,861 --> 00:29:39,560
H, GOD, GIRL, HOW LONG DO

609
00:29:39,562 --> 00:29:39,927
YOU HAVE?

610
00:29:39,929 --> 00:29:40,661
>> ABBY AND I WENT ON ONE DATE

611
00:29:40,663 --> 00:29:41,261
IN 2019.

612
00:29:41,263 --> 00:29:41,829
>> OKAY.

613
00:29:41,831 --> 00:29:42,429
WE WENT ON THREE DATES.

614
00:29:42,431 --> 00:29:43,096
DINNER, MOVIE, AND A

615
00:29:43,098 --> 00:29:44,531
WALK.

616
00:29:44,533 --> 00:29:46,133
>> THE WALK WAS FROM DINNER TO

617
00:29:46,135 --> 00:29:49,469
THE MOVIE, AND THE WHOLE THING

618
00:29:49,471 --> 00:29:50,304
WAS LIKE TWO HOURS.

619
00:29:50,306 --> 00:29:51,271
>> IRREGARDLESS, GRAHAM AND I

620
00:29:51,273 --> 00:29:51,972
HAVE HISTORY, BUT NOW I THINK

621
00:29:51,974 --> 00:29:55,676
WE'RE KILLING THIS FRIENDS

622
00:29:55,678 --> 00:29:56,910
THING, BUBBA.

623
00:29:56,912 --> 00:29:57,644
>> WE'RE MOVING NEXT MONTH, BUT

624
00:29:57,646 --> 00:29:58,378
YOU'LL HAVE TO COME VISIT US IF

625
00:29:58,380 --> 00:29:59,046
YOU'RE EVER IN NEW ORLEANS.

626
00:29:59,048 --> 00:30:03,383
>> WHERE THE SAINTS GO MARCHING

627
00:30:03,385 --> 00:30:06,620
IN?

628
00:30:06,622 --> 00:30:09,923
>> OH, MY GOD, ABBY, DO YOU NEED

629
00:30:09,925 --> 00:30:10,290
A TISSUE?

630
00:30:10,292 --> 00:30:10,591
>> NO.

631
00:30:10,593 --> 00:30:13,727
BECAUSE THESE ARE HAPPY TEARS.

632
00:30:13,729 --> 00:30:15,863
>> WELL, THANKS.

633
00:30:15,865 --> 00:30:16,930
WE'RE REALLY HAPPY TOO.

634
00:30:16,932 --> 00:30:17,664
IT FEELS LIKE A GREAT PLACE TO

635
00:30:17,666 --> 00:30:19,600
RAISE A KID.

636
00:30:19,602 --> 00:30:21,201
>> YOU'RE PREGNANT?

637
00:30:21,203 --> 00:30:24,404
YES!

638
00:30:24,406 --> 00:30:25,472
>> WE'RE DUE IN AUGUST, BUT

639
00:30:25,474 --> 00:30:26,139
MAYBE WE SHOULD TALK ABOUT

640
00:30:26,141 --> 00:30:27,207
SOMETHING ELSE?

641
00:30:27,209 --> 00:30:28,809

00:38:21,722 --> 00:38:22,387
OFF THE RECORD, HE'S GOT A

804
00:38:22,389 --> 00:38:28,560
POINT.

805
00:38:28,562 --> 00:38:30,228
HERE TO COMMENT -- THAT'S WHAT

806
00:38:30,230 --> 00:38:31,830
THE CARD SAYS.

807
00:38:31,832 --> 00:38:38,103
BUT HERE TO COMMENT IS DILBERT!

808
00:38:38,105 --> 00:38:39,504
>> HEY, MICHAEL.

809
00:38:39,506 --> 00:38:40,004
>> HI, DILBERT.

810
00:38:40,006 --> 00:38:40,739
SO HAD YOU EVER SEEN THIS SIDE

811
00:38:40,741 --> 00:38:43,742
OF SCOTT ADAMS BEFORE?

812
00:38:43,744 --> 00:38:45,377
>> MICHAEL, I THINK I CAN SPEAK

813
00:38:45,379 --> 00:38:46,444
FOR MYSELF AND THE ENTIRE ALL

814
00:38:46,446 --> 00:38:48,079
WHITE STAFF AT THE DILBERT

815
00:38:48,081 --> 00:38:48,780
OFFICES WHEN I SAY THIS WAS A

816
00:38:48,782 --> 00:38:50,782
TOTAL SHOCK.

817
00:38:50,784 --> 00:38:51,883
I MEAN MOST CARTOONISTS ARE

818
00:38:51,885 --> 00:38:53,485
WEIRD, BUT RACIST WEIRD?

819
00:38:53,487 --> 00:38:57,288
LET'S JUST SAY I NEVER GOT THAT

820
00:38:57,290 --> 00:38:57,822
MEMO.

821
00:38:57,824 --> 00:38:58,890
RIGHT?

822
00:38:58,892 --> 00:39:03,695
MEMOS.

823
00:39:03,697 --> 00:39:06,731
WORK IS BORING, BUT I CAN BE

824
00:39:06,733 --> 00:39:07,599
FUNNY TOO.

825
00:39:07,601 --> 00:39:08,733
THAT'S KIND OF MY THING.

826
00:39:08,735 --> 00:39:09,467
>> SO YOU JUST THOUGHT SCOTT WAS

827
00:39:09,469 --> 00:39:10,301
WEIRD?

828
00:39:10,303 --> 00:39:11,336
>> NO.

829
00:39:11,338 --> 00:39:15,073
I KNEW HE WAS BAD.

830
00:39:15,075 --> 00:39:20,945
HE MADE ME GO INTO THE OFFICE

831
00:39:20,947 --> 00:39:25,183
EVERY DAY DURING COVID, AND HE

832
00:39:25,185 --> 00:39:25,550
KNOWS I'M

833
00:39:25,552 --> 00:39:25,950
AUTOIMMUNE.

834
00:39:25,952 --> 00:39:26,518
>> YOU'RE AUTOIMMUNE?

835
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:27,252
>> DO I LOOK LIKE SOMEBODY WHO'S

836
00:39:27,254 --> 00:39:27,719
NOT AUTOIMMUNE?

837
00:39:27,721 --> 00:39:28,253
I'M A REAL ATHLETE.

838
00:39:28,255 --> 00:39:28,887
MY HAIR IS SKIN, MICHAEL.

839
00:39:28,889 --> 00:39:29,454
>> YOUR HAIR IS SKIN?

840
00:39:29,456 --> 00:39:29,788
>> YES.

841
00:39:29,790 --> 00:39:31,122
I CANNOT STRESS THIS ENOUGH.

842
00:39:31,124 --> 00:39:31,856
MY HAIR IS ENTIRELY SKIN, AND IT

843
00:39:31,858 --> 00:39:32,724
HAS BEEN THE GREAT TRAGEDY OF MY

844
00:39:32,726 --> 00:39:35,794
LIFE.

845
00:39:35,796 --> 00:39:37,228
>> I'M VERY SORRY.

846
00:39:37,230 --> 00:39:37,729
>> NO.

847
00:39:37,731 --> 00:39:39,364
I'M SORRY, MICHAEL, FOR RACISM.

848
00:39:39,366 --> 00:39:40,432
MAYBE I WAS JUST BLIND TO IT.

849
00:39:40,434 --> 00:39:44,702
I MEAN, MY GLASSES ARE LITERALLY

850
00:39:44,704 --> 00:39:45,103
OPEC WHITE.

851
00:39:45,105 --> 00:39:46,304
TO ME, HE WAS JUST SCOTT, THE

852
00:39:46,306 --> 00:39:47,372
FUNNY GUY, THE TRUMP-SUPPORTING

853
00:39:47,374 --> 00:39:48,106
CARTOONIST WHO DID MAGIC IN HIS

854
00:39:48,108 --> 00:39:49,007
SPARE TIME.

855
00:39:49,009 --> 00:39:49,607
HAD A GREAT KEVIN HART

856
00:39:49,609 --> 00:39:52,210
IMPRESSION.

857
00:39:52,212 --> 00:39:55,246
>> WELL, THAT SOUNDS LIKE A

858
00:39:55,248 --> 00:39:55,680
RACIST TO ME.

859
00:39:55,682 --> 00:39:59,184
>> WELL, TURNS OUT HE WAS A

860
00:39:59,186 --> 00:39:59,517
RACIST.

861
00:39:59,519 --> 00:40:00,118
I'M HIS PRIZED CREATION.

862
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:00,785
WHAT DOES THAT MAKE ME?

863
00:40:00,787 --> 00:40:02,921
I WANTED ANSWERS, SO I TOOK A --

864
00:40:02,923 --> 00:40:05,089
GOD FORBID -- PERSONAL DAY, AND

865
00:40:05,091 --> 00:40:09,627
REALLY STARTED TO DIG IN ON

866
00:40:09,629 --> 00:40:13,264
THE CONCEPT OF WHAT IS WORK,

867
00:40:13,266 --> 00:40:14,632
READING LOTS OF BLACK RADICALS,

868
00:40:14,634 --> 00:40:16,267
AND I REALIZED SOMETHING.

869
00:40:16,269 --> 00:40:18,937
EVEN MUNDANE WORK SERVES TO

870
00:40:18,939 --> 00:40:19,671
UPHOLD A CAPITALIST SYSTEM BASED

871
00:40:19,673 --> 00:40:20,572
ON MAINTAINING RACIAL HIERARCHY,

872
00:40:20,574 --> 00:40:25,710
BUT THAT'S ALL ABOUT TO CHANGE.

873
00:40:25,712 --> 00:40:26,878
RACE WAR IS COMING.

874
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,480
YOU READY, MICHAEL?

875
00:40:28,482 --> 00:40:28,980
>> WHAT?

876
00:40:28,982 --> 00:40:29,481
>> ARE YOU READY?

877
00:40:29,483 --> 00:40:31,683
BECAUSE DILBERT'S READY.

878
00:40:31,685 --> 00:40:36,754
I WOKE UP THIS MORNING READY TO

879
00:40:36,756 --> 00:40:39,123
TAKE THE STREETS AND PAINT THE

880
00:40:39,125 --> 00:40:41,526
CITY WITH THE BLOOD OF THE WHITE

881
00:40:41,528 --> 00:40:41,793
MAN.

882
00:40:41,795 --> 00:40:43,828
>> THAT'S PRETTY INTENSE, MAN.

883
00:40:43,830 --> 00:40:44,429
>> YEAH.

884
00:40:44,431 --> 00:40:48,032
THEN I HAD A CUP OF COFFEE, AND

885
00:40:48,034 --> 00:40:50,301
LIKE I ALWAYS SAY, DON'T EVEN

886
00:40:50,303 --> 00:40:54,339
TALK TO ME BEFORE MY COFFEE.

887
00:40:54,341 --> 00:40:54,806
>> I GOT IT.

888
00:40:54,808 --> 00:40:55,440
WELL, DILBERT, EVERYBODY.

889
00:40:55,442 --> 00:40:56,441

>> A MAN IN MISSOURI IS PLANNING

899

AN AIRBNB RENTAL, WHICH WILL

901

MAKE IT THE FIRST JAIL THAT

902

REFUSES TO ACCEPT BLACK PEOPLE.

903

NEGLECT.

907
00:41:30,877 --> 00:41:31,609
WORSE THE ZOO'S CLOSING IS BEING

908
00:41:31,611 --> 00:41:42,487
ADVERTISED AS ALL YOU CAN EAT.

TELL YOU BUT WHEN PUNKIE AND I

942
00:42:59,332 --> 00:43:02,734
SAT DOWN TO WORK ON THIS, WE

943
00:43:02,736 --> 00:43:05,236
REALIZED THAT PUNKIE DOES NOT

944
00:43:05,238 --> 00:43:08,539
KNOW ANY OTHER CELEBRITIES OR

945

HERE ARE SOME EXAMPLES, AND

THESE ARE ALL 100% TRUE STORIES.

I ONCE SAW PUNKIE CALL TONY

HAWK, TONY HAWKING TO HIS FACE.

953

00:43:27,427 --> 00:43:31,496
HAWKING?

957
00:43:31,498 --> 00:43:34,465
>> I MEAN, LOOK, THEY BOTH WHITE

MEN WITH WHEELS, SO I MEAN --

>> BUT THE BEST THING THAT HAS

960
00:43:39,939 --> 00:43:44,342
EVER HAPPENED WAS A FEW WEEKS

961
00:43:44,344 --> 00:43:47,445
AGO WHEN PUNKIE TOLD ME ALL OF

962

HER FRIENDS COULD NOT

963
00:43:49,416 --> 00:43:50,281
BELIEVE SHE MET RICK BERNSTEIN.

964
00:43:50,283 --> 00:43:51,349

>> THAT'S WHAT I SAID.

966
00:43:52,452 --> 00:43:53,518

>> THE GUY WITH THE JEANS.

969
00:43:58,358 --> 00:44:00,992
I EVENTUALLY FIGURED OUT THAT

970
00:44:00,994 --> 00:44:02,393
PUNKIE WAS REFERRING TO LIVING
