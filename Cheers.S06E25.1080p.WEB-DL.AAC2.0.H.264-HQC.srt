1
00:00:01,146 --> 00:00:04,482
<i>Cheers is filmed
before a live studio audience.</i>

2
00:00:06,018 --> 00:00:09,621
Yeah, it's just a hop, skip
and a jump from the
office to the Ginza.

3
00:00:09,655 --> 00:00:11,706
Look who just slithered in.

4
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:16,470
The carpet cobras,
featuring Evan
"The Snake" Drake.

5
00:00:16,912 --> 00:00:19,447
- I'm all right.
- How are you?

6
00:00:19,482 --> 00:00:21,212
Rebecca, I've got
to use the phone here.

7
00:00:21,234 --> 00:00:24,219
Oh, you're a phone person, too?
So am I.

8
00:00:24,253 --> 00:00:26,704
Isn't it amazing how much
we have in common?

9
00:00:26,739 --> 00:00:28,156
Thanks.

10
00:00:28,758 --> 00:00:30,891
You know that Drake guy?

11
00:00:30,926 --> 00:00:33,191
He's probably the kind of bloke

12
00:00:33,191 --> 00:00:36,698
that has his knuckle hair
removed with electrolysis.

13
00:00:36,732 --> 00:00:38,949
Yeah, he's probably got one
of those electronic zappers

14
00:00:38,984 --> 00:00:42,153
that he uses to forestall
his receding hairline.

15
00:00:42,188 --> 00:00:44,759
And I bet ya,
I bet ya a dime to a donut

16
00:00:44,759 --> 00:00:49,476
that he has his loofa
and he rubs himself raw
to get rid of his cellulite.

17
00:00:52,448 --> 00:00:56,450
<i>Well, it was in
last month's Soldier
of Fortune, okay?</i>

18
00:01:02,074 --> 00:01:04,628
¶ Making your way
in the world today ¶

19
00:01:04,628 --> 00:01:07,562
¶ Takes everything you've got.

20
00:01:07,596 --> 00:01:10,347
¶ Taking a break
from all your worries ¶

21
00:01:10,382 --> 00:01:13,427
¶ Sure would help a lot.

22
00:01:13,427 --> 00:01:17,724

23

28

¶ You want to be where everybody

29
00:01:41,997 --> 00:01:44,298
¶ You want to go

30
00:01:44,333 --> 00:01:46,851
¶ People are all the same.

00:01:46,886 --> 00:01:52,063
¶ You want to go where
everybody knows your name. ¶

32
00:02:13,646 --> 00:02:16,080
Sam, listen.
Don't you find it interesting

33
00:02:16,114 --> 00:02:18,583
that of all the fine restaurants
in Boston to dine,

34
00:02:18,617 --> 00:02:21,366
that Evans should repeatedly
dine at Melville's
right upstairs

35
00:02:21,366 --> 00:02:23,669
from where I can
be found every day of the week?

36
00:02:23,669 --> 00:02:25,757
No, no.
But I do find it interesting

37
00:02:25,791 --> 00:02:30,141
that your button's undone there,
and your bra has a little
bow in the middle.

38
00:02:33,899 --> 00:02:37,602
So, uh, what,
you think the big guy's
finally coming around, huh?

39
00:02:37,636 --> 00:02:40,474
No, he's in there
using my phone.

40
00:02:40,773 --> 00:02:44,075
Can't you see?
Since his divorce became final,

41
00:02:44,109 --> 00:02:46,631
he uses all of his spare
time to be around me.

42
00:02:46,631 --> 00:02:49,314
He is in my office right now
sitting in my chair,

43
00:02:49,348 --> 00:02:55,286
his lips just inches
from the mouthpiece
that I use every day.

44
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:58,957
You're right.
I'm an idiot.

45
00:02:59,299 --> 00:03:01,859
Excuse me. Rebecca, can we talk?

46
00:03:01,894 --> 00:03:03,623
Excuse me, Sam.
I'm being beckoned.

47
00:03:03,623 --> 00:03:06,547
Listen, if-if this is
what you think it is,

48
00:03:06,582 --> 00:03:08,466
- can I give you some advice?
- What?

49
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:11,945
If you're going
to make an ass of yourself,
take it outside.

50
00:03:12,333 --> 00:03:15,526
- I'm not going to
make an ass of myself.
- All right.

51
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:21,335
I was just getting it
out of my system.

52
00:03:22,671 --> 00:03:24,591
You wanted to talk to me,
Mr. Drake?

53
00:03:24,616 --> 00:03:28,986
Yes, yes, yes, I do, Rebecca.
Let's sit down here, okay?

54
00:03:29,021 --> 00:03:30,855
Thank you.

55
00:03:31,924 --> 00:03:34,475
Well, this conversation
is long overdue.

56
00:03:34,509 --> 00:03:38,229
I couldn't agree more,
with all my heart.

57
00:03:38,264 --> 00:03:40,764
You don't know what
I'm going to say.

58
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:43,601
Oh... well, I agree again.

59
00:03:43,635 --> 00:03:48,128
Something... something very
exciting is happening to me.

60
00:03:48,204 --> 00:03:50,625
It's going to change
my whole life.
It's a huge risk.

61
00:03:50,659 --> 00:03:53,060
Take it! Take it!

62
00:03:53,094 --> 00:03:56,630
I'm moving to Tokyo.
I'm going to take over
the Japanese division.
I leave tonight.

63
00:03:56,665 --> 00:03:59,497
Yes, darling, yes!

64
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,220
I told her to take that outside.

65
00:04:14,182 --> 00:04:18,919
I don't believe it.
Everything was going so well.

66
00:04:18,954 --> 00:04:23,725
Then everything went so black.

67
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:27,394
Oh, don't worry about it.
Women faint all the time.

68
00:04:27,429 --> 00:04:30,086
Well, in cartoons, they do.

69
00:04:31,433 --> 00:04:34,201
Do you think he noticed?

70
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:38,305
Yes, yes, I-I think he did.

71
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:41,509
He, uh, he said that
every time he sees you,

72
00:04:41,543 --> 00:04:44,979
you do something more bizarre
than the time before.

73
00:04:45,013 --> 00:04:46,680
What did you say?

74
00:04:46,715 --> 00:04:49,266
Well, honey, I had to agree.

75
00:04:51,304 --> 00:04:54,579
He is leaving for Japan
tonight forever,

76
00:04:54,579 --> 00:04:58,559
and I never got to
tell him how I feel.

77
00:04:58,594 --> 00:05:03,017
Well, hey...
No, wait. You know, listen,
why don't you tell him
at the good-bye party?

78
00:05:03,017 --> 00:05:04,666
What good-bye party?

79
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:06,633
The one you're gonna
throw for him tonight.

80
00:05:06,668 --> 00:05:11,021
Listen, it's a great idea.
I'll make it a...
a Japanese theme.

81
00:05:11,056 --> 00:05:14,602
Yeah, yeah, we'll
have chips and cheese.

82
00:05:16,712 --> 00:05:19,997
Sam,
I will never have Mr. Drake.

83
00:05:20,031 --> 00:05:22,456
I will never have any man.
I will just dry up,

84
00:05:22,522 --> 00:05:26,029
crumble into dust and blow away.

85
00:05:26,171 --> 00:05:28,937
Oh, come on.
That doesn't sound like you.

86
00:05:28,937 --> 00:05:33,478
That sounds like some lovesick
self-pitying, whiny...

87
00:05:33,512 --> 00:05:35,781
No, that's you all right.

88
00:05:36,749 --> 00:05:39,433
But I'm not gonna
let you give up.

89
00:05:39,467 --> 00:05:42,537
What do you care?
What does anybody care?

90
00:05:42,571 --> 00:05:46,565
Listen, I pride myself
in being a connoisseur
of beautiful babes,

91
00:05:46,565 --> 00:05:48,918
and I'll tell you.
I'm not gonna sit by

92
00:05:48,918 --> 00:05:52,182
and watch a great woman like you
going to waste.

93
00:05:52,182 --> 00:05:55,717
It's like, a...
a thoroughbred pulling
a milk wagon.

94
00:05:55,751 --> 00:05:58,409
It's like a rare wine...

95
00:05:58,409 --> 00:06:01,121
pulling a milk wagon.

96
00:06:03,525 --> 00:06:05,442
Sam, I can't tell him.

97
00:06:05,477 --> 00:06:07,912
<i>Oh, please, please, do
this for me, will you?</i>

98
00:06:07,946 --> 00:06:11,065
I've been watching
this sappy movie
for God knows how long.

99
00:06:11,099 --> 00:06:13,902
I want to see if the
girl gets the guy.

100
00:06:13,902 --> 00:06:18,956
If only once I'd ever had
any little bit of
encouragement from him.

101
00:06:18,991 --> 00:06:23,222
Some teeny, tiny
shred of evidence
that he even knew I existed.

102
00:06:23,222 --> 00:06:26,931
Well, now, he-he did
express some concern
while you were out cold there.

103
00:06:26,965 --> 00:06:29,784
Oh, yeah, I bet.
What'd he say?

104
00:06:29,818 --> 00:06:33,105
Gee, I-I hope she's not dead.

105
00:06:34,547 --> 00:06:36,339
He did?

106
00:06:36,339 --> 00:06:41,550
Oh, God.
And all this time I thought
maybe I was kidding myself.

107
00:06:56,979 --> 00:07:00,798
That's a perfect illustration
of life's bitter irony,
isn't it?

108
00:07:00,832 --> 00:07:02,182
Oh, how's that, Cliff?

109
00:07:02,217 --> 00:07:04,755
I mean, would you
pass the beer nuts?

110
00:07:05,738 --> 00:07:09,723
There's a guy like Drake...
It's a fabulous job...

111
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:12,595
Hey, it's time to
make your move.

112
00:07:12,945 --> 00:07:15,505
Come on, he's had
a couple of drinks.

113
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:18,236
His resistance is down.

114
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:21,568
He's feeling all
warm, sentimental.

115
00:07:21,603 --> 00:07:23,603
<i>Hell, I think I'll
tell him I love him.</i>

116
00:07:23,605 --> 00:07:25,907
All right, all right.

117
00:07:30,579 --> 00:07:32,346
Mr. Drake?

118
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:35,405
- Hello, Rebecca.
- Hi.

119
00:07:36,284 --> 00:07:38,102
You're not gonna faint, are you?

120
00:07:38,137 --> 00:07:40,405
Oh, no. No, I'm fine.

121
00:07:40,405 --> 00:07:44,574
I just thought
that this might be
a good opportunity to tell
you something that I've
wanted to tell you
for a long time.

122
00:07:44,574 --> 00:07:47,127
Miss Howe, may I speak with
you for a moment, please?

123
00:07:47,162 --> 00:07:51,015
- Carla, can't it wait?
- I don't think so.
It's kind of a woman's problem.

124
00:07:51,049 --> 00:07:53,950
- Ah, leave those to the experts.
- But I...

125
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:55,153
What? What? What?

126
00:07:55,187 --> 00:07:57,221
Look, look, look, I
wouldn't have butted in,

127
00:07:57,256 --> 00:08:00,628
but I know that tonight
is your last chance
to tell the boss

128
00:08:00,628 --> 00:08:04,034
you got a case
of the screaming
thigh sweats for him.

129
00:08:06,047 --> 00:08:07,872
How did you know that?

130
00:08:07,872 --> 00:08:10,543
Woody put out a special
edition of the newsletter.

131
00:08:10,543 --> 00:08:12,720
Why didn't I just write it
on the bathroom wall?

132
00:08:12,754 --> 00:08:14,802
I'm way ahead of you.

133
00:08:14,802 --> 00:08:20,111
Anyway, look,
I've been down this
road a few times myself,
and take it from a pro,

134
00:08:20,111 --> 00:08:23,531
there is one thing
you always have to do
before you tell a
guy you love him.

135
00:08:23,565 --> 00:08:26,911
- What's that?
- Lose the mustache.

136
00:08:36,148 --> 00:08:38,413
Uh, Mr. Drake,
there's something that I...

137
00:08:38,413 --> 00:08:39,773
Evan. Yes?

138
00:08:39,773 --> 00:08:43,064
- We're really gonna
miss your carpet.
- Yeah, you take care.

139
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:44,435
Anyway, Mr. Drake,
there's something I've wanted

140
00:08:44,469 --> 00:08:46,742
to tell you a long time...
There you go, Mr. Drake.

141
00:08:46,742 --> 00:08:49,122
Hmm? Oh, thank you,
thank you, Woody.

142
00:08:49,122 --> 00:08:52,083
Damn.
I changed all my
American money into yen.

143
00:08:52,083 --> 00:08:53,911
I don't have a tip for you.
I'm sorry, Woody.

144
00:08:53,946 --> 00:08:57,306
- Oh, that's okay, Mr. Drake.
I don't need a tip from you.
- Okay.

145
00:08:57,306 --> 00:08:59,954
Cheap, cheap, cheap.

146
00:09:00,484 --> 00:09:01,945
Mr. Drake, as I was
about to tell you...

147
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:04,639
Hey, hold on, hold on...
Woody, Woody,
come here a second.

148
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:07,806
I've got these
company courtside tickets
to the Celtics-Lakers game.

149
00:09:07,826 --> 00:09:09,310
Will you take those
in lieu of a tip?

150
00:09:09,344 --> 00:09:13,860
Huh? Yes, sir.
I-I hope you'll forget
about that cheap crack.

151
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:16,551
What cheap crack?

152
00:09:16,551 --> 00:09:18,754
You're a prince.

153
00:09:23,395 --> 00:09:27,491
Anyway, Mr. Drake,
um, I've wanted
to tell you something
for a really long time.

154
00:09:27,491 --> 00:09:30,515
Mm-hmm. Hold on there, you two.
Let's, let's get
a picture. Smile.

155
00:09:31,317 --> 00:09:35,518
I just hate those flashbulbs,
don't you, Mr. Drake?

156
00:09:35,937 --> 00:09:37,951
Mr. Drake?

157
00:09:38,607 --> 00:09:42,693
These are some USDA, uh,
prime tickets here.

158
00:09:42,728 --> 00:09:46,462
- So, uh, who's going with you?
- Oh, gee, I don't know.

159
00:09:46,462 --> 00:09:49,466
Well, I think
the obvious choice
would be me, Woody.

160
00:09:49,501 --> 00:09:52,570
I mean, Cliff here
is always making fun
that, uh, you're a yokel.

161
00:09:52,604 --> 00:09:56,067
Whereas, I completely
ignore the fact
that you're a yokel.

162
00:09:57,762 --> 00:10:00,299
Mr. Drake, I...

163
00:10:00,299 --> 00:10:02,963
No. Evan.
I'll call him Evan.

164
00:10:02,998 --> 00:10:04,531
Evan...

165
00:10:04,566 --> 00:10:06,683
I'm a man, you're a woman. I...

166
00:10:06,718 --> 00:10:08,485
No, no.

167
00:10:11,322 --> 00:10:12,869
You get lucky?

168
00:10:13,792 --> 00:10:15,786
I'm sorry. I...

169
00:10:16,667 --> 00:10:20,291
The important thing,
Mr. Drake, is that
I finally have you alone
so I can tell you
what I've wanted
to tell you.

170
00:10:20,291 --> 00:10:22,783
- Pardon me, Mr. Drake.
- Excuse me.

171
00:10:22,818 --> 00:10:25,132
But we're gonna have
to leave now
if you're gonna make your plane.

172
00:10:25,132 --> 00:10:26,503
Oh, yeah. Thanks, bud.

173
00:10:26,538 --> 00:10:27,959
But Mr. Drake, I've really got
to tell you something important.

174
00:10:28,021 --> 00:10:32,008
Uh, Rebecca, hold the thought.
Better yet, telex it, okay?

175
00:10:32,043 --> 00:10:33,814
Bye, Rebecca.

176
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:42,069
Hold that drink for me, babe.

177
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:00,588
Sweetheart, sweetheart, he...

178
00:11:00,622 --> 00:11:03,874
He's gone, and you got to
go on with your life now.

179
00:11:03,909 --> 00:11:06,403
I mean, you got to
pick up the pieces

180
00:11:06,403 --> 00:11:10,374
and-and start behaving like a
mature person.

181
00:11:12,117 --> 00:11:14,635
Well, now you're cookin'.
All right.

182
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:18,172
Excuse me.
Mr. Drake seems
to have forgotten his topcoat.

183
00:11:18,206 --> 00:11:21,288
Tell him it's hanging
on the coat rack.

184
00:11:21,304 --> 00:11:25,132
Uh, I believe.
Mr. Drake's, uh...

185
00:11:25,132 --> 00:11:29,990
topcoat
is in the...
topcoat closet.

186
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:31,869
Sam,
I said to tell him...

187
00:11:31,903 --> 00:11:37,418
No, no. Uh, yes,
we keep all of our
executive topcoats
in this closet right here.

188
00:11:38,076 --> 00:11:41,462
It's, uh, way in the back there.
Way, way in the back.

189
00:11:41,462 --> 00:11:44,127
Watch the hat there.
Watch the hat.

190
00:11:44,127 --> 00:11:47,455
There do not appear
to be any topcoats in here.

191
00:11:47,053 --> 00:11:48,982
My mistake. Ooh!

192
00:11:49,254 --> 00:11:51,367
Is there a light switch?

193
00:11:51,367 --> 00:11:54,125
Does anyone have a key here
for this closet?

194
00:11:54,159 --> 00:11:55,860
I'm-I'm afraid we're gonna
have to make a key there.

195
00:11:55,894 --> 00:11:57,862
- Can you hold on?
- Yeah, but be quick.

196
00:11:57,896 --> 00:12:00,878
Oh, dear.
Martin seems to be locked
in the closet there.

197
00:12:00,878 --> 00:12:03,634
Does anyone know
how to drive a limo around here?

198
00:12:03,668 --> 00:12:06,875
Well, I've driven a tractor.
It can't be that different.

199
00:12:09,008 --> 00:12:11,943
No, Woody, when I said anyone,
I meant Rebecca.

200
00:12:11,977 --> 00:12:15,509
Well, in the future, Sam,
you might try using
a little something

201
00:12:15,531 --> 00:12:19,209
that's popular back in Indiana
called "direct address."

202
00:12:21,186 --> 00:12:22,987
I'm... I'm sorry.

203
00:12:23,021 --> 00:12:25,505
Sam, forget it. I'm going
to let that man out of there.

204
00:12:26,124 --> 00:12:27,576
Hey, don't give up.
Don't give up.

205
00:12:27,576 --> 00:12:28,810
What do you want me to do?

206
00:12:28,844 --> 00:12:30,978
You want me to
masquerade as a chauffeur,

207
00:12:31,013 --> 00:12:32,957
get him alone on the highway,

208
00:12:32,957 --> 00:12:35,998
and tell the man
I want to have his babies?

209
00:12:37,063 --> 00:12:40,745
Martin, I'll be
getting that key now.

210
00:12:54,737 --> 00:12:56,888
I love you, Mr. Drake.

211
00:12:56,922 --> 00:12:59,285
There. I said it.

212
00:12:59,675 --> 00:13:01,976
I love you.

213
00:13:02,011 --> 00:13:06,197
I love you more than anyone
I've ever loved
in my whole life.

214
00:13:06,231 --> 00:13:10,551
I love you more than
any woman's ever loved a man.

215
00:13:10,585 --> 00:13:13,288
Mr. Drake?

216
00:13:13,755 --> 00:13:15,993
Hello?

217
00:13:17,059 --> 00:13:19,696
Oh, God.

218
00:13:21,463 --> 00:13:23,198
Rebecca?

219
00:13:23,198 --> 00:13:25,599
What are you doing
up there? Where's Martin?

220
00:13:25,634 --> 00:13:29,143
Uh... Martin got sick
looking for your topcoat, sir,

221
00:13:29,143 --> 00:13:32,006
so I'll be driving
you to the airport.

222
00:13:32,041 --> 00:13:35,606
I appreciate that,
if it's not too much trouble.

223
00:13:37,864 --> 00:13:42,449
Uh... anyway, now that I've got
you alone here, Mr. Drake,

224
00:13:42,484 --> 00:13:45,285
the real reason
I'm filling in for Martin

225
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:49,245
is so that I could tell you what
I wanted to tell you all night.

226
00:13:50,191 --> 00:13:54,219
What I've been
trying to tell you
since the first time I met you.

227
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:58,354
Get off my tail, scuzzball!

228
00:13:59,001 --> 00:14:02,653
Mr. Drake,
with all my heart...

229
00:14:02,688 --> 00:14:05,406
Could you turn right at the next
corner here, Rebecca?

230
00:14:05,406 --> 00:14:08,092
- We have to pick up Christy.
- Oh, yes, sir.

231
00:14:08,126 --> 00:14:10,692
Mr. Drake, with all my heart...

232
00:14:10,929 --> 00:14:12,596
Christy?

233
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:16,562
Yes. She's the young lady
who is accompanying me to Japan.

234
00:14:17,953 --> 00:14:21,522
"Accompanying" in the modern
sense of the word?

235
00:14:21,557 --> 00:14:24,756
Yeah, you might say so.
She's a very special woman.

236
00:14:24,756 --> 00:14:28,943
Very up front.
Aggressive, even.

237
00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:31,805
You know, the first time we met
a few months ago,

238
00:14:31,805 --> 00:14:35,235
she was the one
who actually asked me out.

239
00:14:35,754 --> 00:14:38,008
God, that's refreshing.

240
00:14:39,685 --> 00:14:41,815
Anyway...

241
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:44,996
you wanted to ask me something?

242
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:49,283
Oh, yes, sir.
I just wanted
to tell you that...

243
00:14:51,703 --> 00:14:55,531
...that this is really
a lot of car to handle.

244
00:14:57,209 --> 00:14:59,600
I can't believe
I have the strength

245
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:04,347
to keep from swerving
into the oncoming traffic
and killing us both.

246
00:15:11,539 --> 00:15:15,260
Sammy?
You mind if I ask you
a question?
No, go ahead.

247
00:15:15,294 --> 00:15:17,821
I've been trying
to figure out your strategy.

248
00:15:17,821 --> 00:15:23,177
Hmm. You know,
I've always admired you
for being sort of
a selfish, egotistical pig.

249
00:15:23,177 --> 00:15:24,678
Why, thank you, Carla.

250
00:15:24,678 --> 00:15:28,442
But suddenly,
you're locking chauffeurs
in closets,

251
00:15:28,535 --> 00:15:30,258
and giving going-away parties.

252
00:15:30,258 --> 00:15:32,326
It's like you're
bending over backwards

253
00:15:32,326 --> 00:15:36,511
to help Boss Howe
score with Mega-Boss Drake.

254
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:42,101
This kind of self-sacrifice
isn't like you,
and it's scaring me.

255
00:15:42,101 --> 00:15:45,906
Please, please, tell me
you have some sleazy
ulterior motive.

256
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:48,342
Fear not, little one.

257
00:15:49,661 --> 00:15:51,417
So you don't think
they're gonna make it.

258
00:15:51,417 --> 00:15:53,943
I just wanted to bring
this whole thing to a boil,

259
00:15:53,943 --> 00:15:59,052
so when it blows up, I can...
swoop in and gather up
the pieces.

260
00:15:59,087 --> 00:16:01,939
I call it my, uh,
vulture position.

261
00:16:03,158 --> 00:16:07,187
Sammy?
You've got Wessonality.

262
00:16:07,507 --> 00:16:09,097
Thank you.

263
00:16:09,236 --> 00:16:11,678
Hey, hey, hey, huh?
How about that?

264
00:16:11,678 --> 00:16:14,032
According to vulture time,
I bet that's my, uh,

265
00:16:14,032 --> 00:16:17,104
wounded little sparrow
right now.

266
00:16:17,138 --> 00:16:19,070
Hello?

267
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:21,115
Hi, Rebecca.

268
00:16:21,476 --> 00:16:24,767
O-Okay.
Uh, can you hold
one second, please?

269
00:16:24,767 --> 00:16:28,751
"Sam, I need your help."
Unquote.

270
00:16:28,751 --> 00:16:32,551
Yeah.
I'm-I'm taking off right now.

271
00:16:37,943 --> 00:16:40,327
Here we go.
Here we go.

272
00:16:40,362 --> 00:16:43,768
Why don't you go in
and sit down there?
Here you go.

273
00:16:43,768 --> 00:16:46,165
There you go.

274
00:16:57,662 --> 00:17:00,464
Do you feel like
you can talk about it yet?

275
00:17:04,653 --> 00:17:07,827
Thank you for bailing
me out of jail.

276
00:17:09,541 --> 00:17:11,242
Anytime.

277
00:17:11,276 --> 00:17:15,945
Oh, God.
This has been
the worst night of my life. Oh.

278
00:17:15,945 --> 00:17:18,332
Of anybody's life.

279
00:17:18,366 --> 00:17:21,965
I pour out my heart and
soul to the man I love,

280
00:17:21,965 --> 00:17:25,939
then he tells me he's taking
someone else across the globe.

281
00:17:25,974 --> 00:17:28,591
I hate guys like that.

282
00:17:30,712 --> 00:17:34,475
And she's really cute, Sam.

283
00:17:34,475 --> 00:17:37,545
And they made out
in the back seat.

284
00:17:38,053 --> 00:17:41,605
And he didn't even
roll up the window.

285
00:17:41,639 --> 00:17:44,391
The man is a pig.

286
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:50,113
I tried not to look,

287
00:17:50,148 --> 00:17:54,128
but the rearview mirror
was just huge,
and I couldn't help it.

288
00:17:54,519 --> 00:17:56,320
And then I got so upset,

289
00:17:56,354 --> 00:18:00,405
I just wrapped the company limo
around a 7-Eleven.

290
00:18:01,076 --> 00:18:03,744
Well, that is dreadful.

291
00:18:03,779 --> 00:18:06,471
Very, very, very sad.

292
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:11,218
And then Evan
and his cheap imitation
Geisha bimbo whore

293
00:18:11,252 --> 00:18:13,081
grabbed a taxi.

294
00:18:14,105 --> 00:18:18,024
While I had to stand there
and wait for a tow truck.

295
00:18:18,493 --> 00:18:20,293
Oh, and then this
cop came along,

296
00:18:20,293 --> 00:18:24,165
and he asked me to see
my chauffeur's license.

297
00:18:24,199 --> 00:18:26,566
God, if only I'd had one.

298
00:18:26,601 --> 00:18:31,639
Or if only I'd remembered
to bring my purse with
my own driver's license.

299
00:18:31,673 --> 00:18:36,644
Or if only I'd resisted arrest
and he just shot me dead.

300
00:18:47,606 --> 00:18:49,139
Well...

301
00:18:49,173 --> 00:18:52,852
maybe I ought to
leave you alone now.

302
00:18:53,378 --> 00:18:57,464
By yourself...
with some music...

303
00:18:57,499 --> 00:19:01,703
with your depression...
alone.

304
00:19:02,587 --> 00:19:05,729
Sam, can I offer you
a cup of coffee or...

305
00:19:05,729 --> 00:19:08,108
olives?

306
00:19:09,661 --> 00:19:12,788
I didn't have a chance
to go to the grocery store.

307
00:19:12,788 --> 00:19:17,602
I, um...
just kind of don't want
to be alone right now.

308
00:19:17,636 --> 00:19:21,703
Then you shouldn't be.
You need consolation now.

309
00:19:21,703 --> 00:19:27,622
And warmth.
Lots and lots of warmth.

310
00:19:34,919 --> 00:19:39,389
You know, Sam,
I don't have anything
sexual in mind.

311
00:19:39,423 --> 00:19:41,345
I just need
a shoulder to cry on.

312
00:19:41,345 --> 00:19:45,484
Oh, honey, you cry
on anything you want.

313
00:19:49,601 --> 00:19:55,099
Gee, Sam...
what I needed right
now was a friend.

314
00:19:55,099 --> 00:19:58,208
And you're the best friend
I have in the whole world.

315
00:19:58,242 --> 00:20:01,967
No, no.
No, you got plenty of friends.

316
00:20:01,967 --> 00:20:03,997
What, girlfriends, maybe?

317
00:20:04,032 --> 00:20:05,916
Old college friends?

318
00:20:05,950 --> 00:20:10,071
No... I've kind of
grown apart from my old friends,

319
00:20:10,071 --> 00:20:14,791
and I haven't had a
chance to make new ones
with work and everything.

320
00:20:15,377 --> 00:20:18,595
Well, that...
that just leaves...

321
00:20:18,595 --> 00:20:21,005
Yeah, you.

322
00:20:22,283 --> 00:20:26,920
- I'm your best friend?
- Crazy, huh?

323
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:32,442
I really think I ought to go.

324
00:20:32,477 --> 00:20:34,745
Sam, why?

325
00:20:34,779 --> 00:20:37,314
Hey, I like you.

326
00:20:37,348 --> 00:20:40,133
I mean, there's not anything
I wouldn't do for you
in the world,

327
00:20:40,168 --> 00:20:42,502
but I-I know what's gonna happen
if I stay here.

328
00:20:42,536 --> 00:20:45,522
You're going to cry some more,
and I'll comfort you some more,

329
00:20:45,556 --> 00:20:47,207
and the next thing you know, uh,

330
00:20:47,242 --> 00:20:50,421
your pantyhose will be
hanging from the lamp.

331
00:20:52,547 --> 00:20:54,898
Sam, please, don't go.

332
00:20:54,933 --> 00:20:57,768
Hey, I can't be trusted.

333
00:20:57,802 --> 00:20:59,320
Trust me.

334
00:21:01,506 --> 00:21:06,030
Le-Let me just leave here now
as a friend, please?

335
00:21:06,978 --> 00:21:09,383
Oh, I'm sorry, I...

336
00:21:15,637 --> 00:21:20,198
Listen.
I want to try this.

337
00:21:20,625 --> 00:21:22,811
For the sake
of our friendship,

338
00:21:22,811 --> 00:21:25,590
I am just gonna resist
my sexual urges,

339
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:29,033
and that's all there is to it.
Now, come here.

340
00:21:29,067 --> 00:21:32,269
There.
All right.

341
00:21:32,304 --> 00:21:34,714
All right, now...

342
00:21:34,714 --> 00:21:39,606
You know that I loved Evan Drake
since the first time I met him.

343
00:21:39,606 --> 00:21:42,995
I'm sorry, this is not working.
Hot fire below.

344
00:22:29,677 --> 00:22:31,554
- Hello.
- Hi.

345
00:22:31,554 --> 00:22:36,082
Listen, if this
is what it takes to be a friend,
then I really want
to give it a shot, okay?

346
00:22:36,082 --> 00:22:39,420
So...
we've got all evening here.
Pour your heart out.

347
00:22:39,454 --> 00:22:44,263
- Where are you?
- I'm downstairs
at a pay phone.

348
00:22:44,263 --> 00:22:48,378
But just, uh, pretend like
I'm right there beside you,
all right?

349
00:22:48,412 --> 00:22:52,261
- Thanks, Sam.
- Yeah. Yeah, you're welcome.

350
00:22:52,550 --> 00:22:56,836
Well...
as you know,

351
00:22:56,902 --> 00:23:01,392
I have loved Evan Drake
since the first time I saw him.

352
00:23:01,426 --> 00:23:02,861
I know.

353
00:23:02,861 --> 00:23:07,088
Sam, this is silly.
Get up here.

354
00:23:07,088 --> 00:23:10,925
Sam, you know
what I've been through.
You're not going
to take advantage of me.

355
00:23:10,925 --> 00:23:12,769
Oh, yeah?

356
00:23:14,772 --> 00:23:16,479
Do me a favor, will you?

357
00:23:16,474 --> 00:23:18,634
Check your bra.

358
00:23:22,570 --> 00:23:25,174
How did you do that?

359
00:23:27,635 --> 00:23:47,775
translate
