00:09:08,888 --> 00:09:12,597
EVERYBODY'S FIXATED ON HOW
GOOD-LOOKING THIS GUY

171
00:09:12,597 --> 00:09:17,203
LOOKS ARE
FOR YOU LOOK LIKE JONAH HILL, NO
ONE WOULD CARE.

172
00:09:17,203 --> 00:09:23,462
THEY ALREADY GAVE HIM THE CHAIR
ALREADY, HE'D BE DEAD, OKAY?

173
00:09:24,074 --> 00:09:27,931
BUT HE ACTUALLY KILLED A MAN.
A MAN.

174
00:09:27,931 --> 00:09:31,353
A MAN WITH A FAMILY.
A FAMILY.
KIDS, MAN.

175
00:09:31,353 --> 00:09:33,526
I MEAN, I HAVE CONDOLENCES.

176
00:09:33,526 --> 00:09:38,951
I HAVE REAL CONDOLENCES FOR, YOU
KNOW, FOR THE HEALTH CARE CEO.

177
00:09:38,951 --> 00:09:42,522
I MEAN, THIS IS A REAL PERSON,
YOU KNOW?

178
00:09:42,522 --> 00:09:45,098
BUT YOU ALSO GOT TO GO, YOU KNOW,

179
00:09:45,098 --> 00:09:48,220
SOMETIMES DRUG DEALERS GET
SHOT.

180
00:09:54,755 --> 00:09:58,007
I MEAN, YOU SEEN "THE WIRE,"
RIGHT?

181
00:09:58,007 --> 00:10:03,305
IT'S BEEN A BAD YEAR FOR MY
PEOPLE, BLACKS.

182
00:10:03,305 --> 00:10:05,630
IT'S BEEN -- IT'S NOT BEEN A
GOOD YEAR.

183
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:09,010
KAMALA.
DIDDY.

184
00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:11,452
JAKE PAUL.

185
00:10:11,452 --> 00:10:15,016
BEATING MIKE TYSON.
WHAT THE HELL?

186
00:10:15,016 --> 00:10:17,212
WHO IS THIS JAKE PAUL?

187
00:10:17,212 --> 00:10:22,844
THIS 27-YEAR-OLD PUNCHING A
60-YEAR-OLD MAN IN THE FACE?

188
00:10:22,844 --> 00:10:26,218
IS THIS WHAT THE WHITE MAN HAS
REDUCED HIMSELF TO?

189
00:10:26,218 --> 00:10:27,821
STOP IT.

190
00:10:27,821 --> 00:10:31,801
WHO'S HE GOING TO FIGHT NEXT,
MORGAN FREEMAN?

191
00:10:33,151 --> 00:10:35,551
I HATE JAKE PAUL.

192
00:10:35,551 --> 00:10:39,439
I GOT LANDLORD HATE FOR HIM.

193
00:10:39,439 --> 00:10:41,596
I HATE HIM.

194
00:10:41,596 --> 00:10:45,880
I HATE HIM LIKE COCAINE HATES
MONOGAMY.

195
00:10:49,309 --> 00:10:53,294
THE BIG THING, BIG THING, TRUMP,
MAN, TRUMP.

196
00:10:53,294 --> 00:10:56,411
TRUMP, MAN.
TRUMP HAD A GOOD YEAR, MAN.

197
00:10:56,411 --> 00:11:00,703
TRUMP SURVIVED AN ASSASSINATION
ATTEMPT.

198
00:11:00,703 --> 00:11:03,124
SURVIVED ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT.

199
00:11:03,124 --> 00:11:07,779
WON THE PRESIDENCY AGAIN BY
WINNING THE POPULAR VOTE.

200
00:11:07,779 --> 00:11:12,099
WAS JUST NAMED "TIME" MAN OF THE
YEAR.

201
00:11:13,152 --> 00:11:17,366
IT COULD HAPPEN TO A NICER GUY.

202
00:11:18,411 --> 00:11:21,285
YOU KNOW, A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE
SCARED.

203
00:11:21,285 --> 00:11:24,134
LIKE, OH, MY GOD, HE'S GOING TO
BE SO UNDIGNIFIED.

204
00:11:24,134 --> 00:11:26,125
WHEN I SAY A LOT OF PEOPLE, I'M TALKING ABOUT

205
00:11:26,125 --> 00:11:29,135
 THE NINE NEW YORK
THERE'S DIDN'T VOTE FOR HIM,
OKAY?

206
00:11:29,135 --> 00:11:32,507
NO, NO, PEOPLE ARE LIKE, "HE'S
GOING TO BE SO UNDIGNIFIED, 

207
00:11:32,507 --> 00:11:35,788
IT'S
THE PRESIDENCY OF THE UNITED
STATES."

208
00:11:35,788 --> 00:11:39,953
DUDE.
IT'S THE UNITED STATES.

209
00:11:39,953 --> 00:11:42,461
IT'S NOT -- YOU KNOW, COME ON.

210
00:11:42,461 --> 00:11:47,501
WE'VE HAD SOME PRESIDENTS IN THE
UNITED STATES, COME ON, MAN.

211
00:11:47,559 --> 00:11:50,627
THIS IS NOT THE MOST DIGNIFIED
JOB IN THE WORLD.

212
00:11:50,627 --> 00:11:54,195
YOU KNOW, WE'VE HAD PRESIDENTS
SHOW UP TO THE INAUGURATION 

213
00:11:54,195 --> 00:11:57,149
WITH
PREGNANT SLAVES, OKAY?

214
00:11:58,853 --> 00:12:02,520
AND I'M JUST TALKING ABOUT BILL
CLINTON.

215
00:12:06,686 --> 00:12:09,599
I MEAN, YOU KNOW WHAT COUNTRY WE
LIVE IN.

216
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:12,814
YOU KNOW THE HISTORY OF THIS
COUNTRY.

217
00:12:12,814 --> 00:12:16,673
YOU KNOW HOW MANY RAPISTS ARE IN
MY WALLET RIGHT NOW?

218
00:12:19,991 --> 00:12:24,969
A CUP OF COFFEE IN AMERICA COSTS
SEVEN RAPISTS!

219
00:12:26,211 --> 00:12:35,036
TRUMP'S GOING TO GET IT DOWN TO

220
00:12:35,038 --> 00:12:35,336
THREE.

221
00:12:36,673 --> 00:12:40,842
THAT'S RIGHT, MAN.

222
00:12:40,844 --> 00:12:42,243
IT'S CRAZY.

223
00:12:42,245 --> 00:12:43,845
MENENDEZ BROTHERS GETTING OUT OF

224
00:12:43,847 --> 00:12:44,145
JAIL.

225
00:12:44,147 --> 00:12:45,613
MENENDEZ BROTHERS?

226
00:12:45,615 --> 00:12:49,050
YEAH, GETTING OUT OF JAIL.

227
00:12:49,052 --> 00:12:52,887
JUST IN TIME TO GET DEPORTED.

228
00:12:55,058 --> 00:12:57,125
TRUMP IS GOING TO DEPORT THEIR

229
00:12:57,127 --> 00:12:58,259
ASS, YOU MURDERING MEXICANS!

230
00:13:01,298 --> 00:13:03,298
TRUMP IS NOT PLAYING, MAN.

231
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:03,798
THAT'S RIGHT.

232
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,333
THIS TIME IT'S TOTALLY

233
00:13:05,335 --> 00:13:05,700
DIFFERENT.

234
00:13:05,702 --> 00:13:08,803
HE'S WORKING WITH THE NUMBER ONE

235
00:13:08,805 --> 00:13:09,771
AFRICAN AMERICAN IN THE WORLD.

236
00:13:09,773 --> 00:13:11,506
THE RICHEST AFRICAN AMERICAN IN

237
00:13:11,508 --> 00:13:11,873
THE WORLD.

238
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:12,774
ELON MUSK.

239
00:13:17,914 --> 00:13:18,346
THAT'S RIGHT.

240
00:13:18,348 --> 00:13:20,748
HE IS AFRICAN AMERICAN.

241
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:21,950
ELON GOT MORE KIDS THAN THE

242
00:13:21,952 --> 00:13:22,450
CLEVELAND BROWNS.

243
00:13:25,522 --> 00:13:25,987
THAT'S RIGHT.

244
00:13:25,989 --> 00:13:27,889
NOBODY KNOWS HOW TO GET RID OF

245
00:13:27,891 --> 00:13:29,624
PEOPLE LIKE A SOUTH AFRICAN.

246
00:13:35,098 --> 00:13:36,130
OH, HE'S SERIOUS.

247
00:13:36,132 --> 00:13:37,532
TRUMP IS NOT PLAYING.

248
00:13:37,534 --> 00:13:38,967
HE GOT ELON.

249
00:13:38,969 --> 00:13:41,035
THEY'RE GOING TO PUT THEM IN A

250
00:13:41,037 --> 00:13:44,105
ROCKET SHIP.

251
00:13:44,107 --> 00:13:45,373
CALL IT "SPACEMEX."

252
00:13:45,375 --> 00:13:49,010
OH, YEAH.

253
00:13:49,012 --> 00:13:51,513
J. LO'S GOING TO MARRY BEN AGAIN

254
00:13:51,515 --> 00:13:54,449
JUST SO SHE CAN STAY IN THE

255
00:13:54,451 --> 00:13:54,782
COUNTRY.

256
00:13:56,286 --> 00:13:59,587
I KNOW SHE'S NOT MEXICAN.

257
00:13:59,589 --> 00:14:00,255
BUT TRUMP DOESN'T KNOW THAT.

258
00:14:07,631 --> 00:14:09,564
JUST A BIG OLD LATIN STEW.

259
00:14:09,566 --> 00:14:11,299
TRYING TO KEEP IMMIGRANTS OUT,

260
00:14:11,301 --> 00:14:11,733
MY GOD.

261
00:14:11,735 --> 00:14:13,701
YOU KNOW, A LOT LESS IMMIGRANTS

262
00:14:13,703 --> 00:14:15,270
WOULD COME INTO AMERICA IF YOU'D

263
00:14:15,272 --> 00:14:18,139
STOP PAYING THEM $700 MILLION TO

264
00:14:18,141 --> 00:14:18,573
PLAY BASEBALL.

265
00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:28,816
STEVE COHEN BOUGHT ONE DOMINICAN

266
00:14:28,818 --> 00:14:30,652
FOR $700 MILLION.

267
00:14:30,654 --> 00:14:32,420
USED TO BE ABLE TO GET A WHOLE

268
00:14:32,422 --> 00:14:32,987
BUSHEL FOR THAT MUCH.

269
00:14:36,626 --> 00:14:37,825
I SAID BUSHEL!

270
00:14:42,332 --> 00:14:44,432

THAT'S RIGHT, MAN -- JOE BIDEN

00:14:47,571 --> 00:14:49,337
PARDONED HIS SON, HUNTER BIDEN.

273
00:14:49,339 --> 00:14:51,172
I GOT TO HAND IT TO JOE, MAN.

274
00:14:51,174 --> 00:14:52,874
YOU KNOW, HE DON'T MOVE AS FAST

275
00:14:52,876 --> 00:14:54,242
AS HE USED TO.

276
00:14:54,244 --> 00:14:56,177
HE DON'T TALK AS FAST AS HE USED

277
00:14:56,179 --> 00:14:56,444
TO.

278
00:14:56,446 --> 00:14:59,047
YOU KNOW, BUT THAT MIDDLE FINGER

279
00:14:59,049 --> 00:15:01,616
STILL WORKS, BOY.

280
00:15:07,057 --> 00:15:07,956
THAT'S RIGHT, MAN.

281
00:15:07,958 --> 00:15:09,557
PEOPLE ARE COMPLAINING.

282
00:15:09,559 --> 00:15:13,061
GOT THE NERVE TO COMPLAIN.

283
00:15:13,063 --> 00:15:13,561
LIKE, WHAT?

284
00:15:13,563 --> 00:15:16,464
ONLY AN ANIMAL WOULD NOT PARDON

285
00:15:16,466 --> 00:15:17,632
THEIR SON.

286
00:15:17,634 --> 00:15:18,566
MY GOD.

287
00:15:18,568 --> 00:15:20,501
IMAGINE GOING HOME TO YOUR WIFE

288
00:15:20,503 --> 00:15:23,237
IF YOU DIDN'T PARDON YOUR SON.

289
00:15:23,239 --> 00:15:25,373
EVERY PARENT IN THE WORLD WOULD

290
00:15:25,375 --> 00:15:28,910
PARDON THEIR SON.

291
00:15:28,912 --> 00:15:32,146

00:17:32,419 --> 00:17:33,151
COULDN'T QUITE HEAR YOU.

334
00:17:33,153 --> 00:17:35,753
>> WE WANT TO SEE THE WHITE

335
00:17:35,755 --> 00:17:37,221
SANTA CLAUS, PLEASE.

336
00:17:37,223 --> 00:17:40,057
>> OH, THAT IS SHOCKING.

337
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:40,525
RIGHT THIS WAY.

338
00:17:40,527 --> 00:17:43,494
WHO'S NEXT?

339
00:17:43,496 --> 00:17:45,930
>> HI, YEAH, I'M SORRY, WHY ARE

340
00:17:45,932 --> 00:17:46,898
THERE TWO SANTAS?

341
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,566
>> WELL, IT'S THE BUSIEST TIME

342
00:17:48,568 --> 00:17:49,133
OF YEAR.

343
00:17:49,135 --> 00:17:51,269
AND THIS CUTS THE WAIT TIME IN

344
00:17:51,271 --> 00:17:51,669
HALF.

345
00:17:51,671 --> 00:17:52,370
AREN'T YOU HAPPY THERE'S TWO

346
00:17:52,372 --> 00:17:54,839
SANTAS?

347
00:17:54,841 --> 00:17:57,775
>> YEAH, NO, DEFINITELY.

348
00:17:57,777 --> 00:17:58,509
>> MUCH MORE CONVENIENT, THANK

349
00:17:58,511 --> 00:17:59,076
YOU FOR DOING THIS.

350
00:17:59,078 --> 00:17:59,510
>> OKAY, OKAY.

351
00:17:59,512 --> 00:18:02,480
TIME TO DECIDE.

352
00:18:02,482 --> 00:18:03,214
WHAT DO YOU WANT GRANDMA TO DO

353
00:18:03,216 --> 00:18:05,683
WITH THE PICTURE?

354
00:18:05,685 --> 00:18:07,151
DO YOU WANT HER TO PUT IT ON THE

355
00:18:07,153 --> 00:18:07,485
FRIDGE?

356
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:08,052
OR IN THE GARAGE?

357
00:18:12,225 --> 00:18:14,725
>> UM -- WE --

358
00:18:14,727 --> 00:18:16,761
>> SO WHICH SANTA IS IT GOING TO

359
00:18:16,763 --> 00:18:17,128
BE?

360
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:20,064
>> WE JUST REMEMBERED THAT WE'RE

361
00:18:20,066 --> 00:18:20,565
JEWISH.

362
00:18:20,567 --> 00:18:20,998
COME ON, GANG.

363
00:18:22,936 --> 00:18:29,040
>> ALL RIGHT.

364
00:18:29,042 --> 00:18:31,042
BIANCA AND A LOU WASSERMAN TO

365
00:18:31,044 --> 00:18:31,509
YOU TOO.

366
00:18:31,511 --> 00:18:32,477
>> HI, WE'RE HERE TO MEET SANTA.

367
00:18:32,479 --> 00:18:36,180
>> WELL.

368
00:18:36,182 --> 00:18:37,248
WE'VE GOT TWO EQUALLY QUALIFIED

369
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:39,050
SANTAS TO CHOOSE FROM.

370
00:18:39,052 --> 00:18:42,320
TAKE YOUR PICK.

371
00:18:42,322 --> 00:18:43,054
>> I DON'T KNOW, THEY BOTH SEEM

372
00:18:43,056 --> 00:18:44,489
GREAT.

373
00:18:44,491 --> 00:18:47,191
>> WELL, THEY'RE ONLY -- YOU

374
00:18:47,193 --> 00:18:48,192
KNOW, THEY ARE.

375
00:18:48,194 --> 00:18:49,160
BUT ONLY ONE SEEMS TO BE GETTING

376
00:18:49,162 --> 00:18:51,762
ALL THE WORK.

377
00:18:51,764 --> 00:18:52,263
THAT'S RIGHT.

378
00:18:52,265 --> 00:18:55,132
ONE SANTA'S BEEN BUSY ALL DAY.

379
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:58,002
AND THE OTHER SANTA IS SO FREE,

380
00:18:58,004 --> 00:18:58,603
HE'S ON A ZOOM MEETING.

381
00:19:02,509 --> 00:19:03,808
>> WELL, I DON'T WANT TO

382
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:05,142
INTERRUPT HIS MEETING, SO WE'LL

383
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:07,345
JUST WAIT FOR THE OTHER ONE.

384
00:19:07,347 --> 00:19:09,514
>> OKAY, WELL, I JUST WANT TO

385
00:19:09,516 --> 00:19:12,083
SAY I WILL BE CHOOSING THE BLACK

386
00:19:12,085 --> 00:19:12,416
SANTA.

387
00:19:12,418 --> 00:19:15,119
I SEE YOU, BLANTA.

388
00:19:15,522 --> 00:19:18,122
>> BLANTA IS NOT A THING, PLEASE

389
00:19:18,124 --> 00:19:19,390
DO NOT CALL ME THAT.

390
00:19:19,392 --> 00:19:21,392
>> I AM JUST SO EMBARRASSED BY

391
00:19:21,394 --> 00:19:23,194
THESE SMALL-MINDED PEOPLE WHO

392
00:19:23,196 --> 00:19:25,730
CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE SANTA BEING

393
00:19:25,732 --> 00:19:27,098
ANYTHING OTHER THAN A STRAIGHT

394
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:28,499
WHITE MAN.

395
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:30,234
IN FACT, IF THERE WAS A QUEER

396
00:19:30,236 --> 00:19:31,102
FEMALE SANTA, I WOULD CHOOSE

397
00:19:31,104 --> 00:19:34,038
THEM.

398
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:38,109
>> WELL, YOU'RE IN LUCK.

399
00:19:38,778 --> 00:19:39,844
'CAUSE THEY'RE HERE.

400
00:19:39,846 --> 00:19:41,946
SAY HI TO SANTA NUMBER THREE.

401
00:19:41,948 --> 00:19:42,246
>> HI.

402
00:19:42,248 --> 00:19:43,748
HO HO HO.

403
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:47,585
>> BLACK.

404
00:19:47,587 --> 00:19:48,786
>> WHAT'S THAT?

405
00:19:48,788 --> 00:19:50,454
W WE'LL GO WITH THE BLACK ONE,

406
00:19:50,456 --> 00:19:52,557
THANK YOU.

407

COME ON, LET'S GO SEE BLANTA.

408
00:19:54,093 --> 00:19:56,460
>> I DON'T LIKE BLANTA AT ALL,

409
00:19:56,462 --> 00:19:57,562
I'M GOING TO GO AHEAD AND TAKE

410
00:19:57,564 --> 00:19:58,195
MY LUNCH, ACTUALLY.

411
00:19:58,197 --> 00:19:59,931
>> OKAY, LOOKS LIKE SANTA IS

412
00:19:59,933 --> 00:20:01,465
GOING ON A BREAK.

413
00:20:01,467 --> 00:20:02,767
>> OH, YES!

414
00:20:02,769 --> 00:20:04,135
>> DON'T CLAP YET, BECAUSE IT'S

415
00:20:04,137 --> 00:20:07,738
TIME TO BRING OUT OUR BACKUP.

416
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:11,742
EVERYONE WELCOME ARAB SANTA.

MARIJUANA NIPPLE PASTIES.

421
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:53,618
>> THOUGHT THEY WERE EARTH DAY

422
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:53,985
STICKERS.

423
00:20:53,987 --> 00:20:54,385

00:20:54,387 --> 00:20:55,519
THANK YOU.

425
00:20:55,521 --> 00:20:56,754

00:21:02,095 --> 00:21:02,693
HAS DELIVERED -- OKAY.

429
00:21:02,695 --> 00:21:03,661
WHAT AM I LOOKING AT?

430
00:21:06,399 --> 00:21:08,466
>> WELL, NOT TO OUT MYSELF AS

431
00:21:08,468 --> 00:21:10,434
YOUR SECRET SANTA, BUT I MADE

432
00:21:10,436 --> 00:21:13,471
YOU INTO A SIMPSONS CHARACTER.

433
00:21:13,473 --> 00:21:16,140
>> YOU MADE ME INTO A SIMPSONS

434
00:21:16,142 --> 00:21:16,507
CHARACTER?

435
00:21:16,509 --> 00:21:18,943
SO I'M LIKE IN THE SHOW NOW?

436
00:21:18,945 --> 00:21:19,877
>> WELL, NO.

437
00:21:19,879 --> 00:21:26,050
I JUST MADE IT USE AN APP CALLED

438
00:21:26,052 --> 00:21:26,450
SIMPSIFY.

439
00:21:26,452 --> 00:21:29,754
YOU SENT IN A PHOTO, THEY MAKE

00:21:32,925 --> 00:21:33,257
TREVOR.

444
00:21:33,259 --> 00:21:34,358
THIS IS THE BEST GIFT I'VE

445
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:35,059
GOTTEN IN MY LIFE, SERIOUSLY.

446

OH, A JUMP ROPE.

451
00:21:44,103 --> 00:21:44,535
>> I PANICKED.

452
00:21:46,105 --> 00:21:50,708
>> NO -- I LIKE IT.

453
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:52,243
I'M JUST NOT TOTALLY SURE THAT I

454
00:21:52,245 --> 00:21:52,943
CAN USE IT FOR ANOTHER SEVEN

455
00:21:52,945 --> 00:21:53,277
MONTHS.

456
00:21:55,948 --> 00:21:59,216
>> AGAIN, I'M REALLY SORRY.

457
00:21:59,218 --> 00:22:00,317

00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:00,885
WHAT WOULD MY JOB IN

00:22:08,761 --> 00:22:09,727
LIKE YOU ARE IN REAL LIFE.

464
00:22:09,729 --> 00:22:11,696
>> WRONG.

465
00:22:11,698 --> 00:22:14,865
WHEELS?

466
00:22:15,268 --> 00:22:17,268
>> MY NAME IS SUSAN.

467
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:19,837
>> IN HIS DEFENSE, YOUR NAME IS

468
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:20,838
SUSAN WHEELS.

469
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,606
>> YEAH, I JUST DON'T THINK HE

470
00:22:22,608 --> 00:22:24,675
MEANT IT THAT WAY.

471
00:22:24,677 --> 00:22:25,376
BUT MAYBE YOU WORK WITH MR.

472
00:22:25,378 --> 00:22:25,710
BURNS.

473
00:22:25,712 --> 00:22:27,712
>> NO.

474
00:22:27,714 --> 00:22:30,448
I'M A DANCE TEACHER.

475
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:32,516
AT BART'S SCHOOL.

476
00:22:32,518 --> 00:22:34,318
AND BART LIKES ME.

477
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:37,054
BECAUSE I SEE SOMETHING IN HIM.

00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:38,823
>> COOL, MAN, YEAH.

479
00:22:39,225 --> 00:22:40,224
THAT SEEMS FINE.

I'M GLAD YOU'RE ENJOYING THE

481
00:22:41,961 --> 00:22:42,259

>> OKAY, CAN I GET A GIFT NOW?

483
00:22:46,165 --> 00:22:49,800
I HAVEN'T OPENED MINE YET.

484
00:22:49,802 --> 00:22:51,035

AVOID IN SPRINGFIELD.

491
00:23:01,114 --> 00:23:05,249
HOMER.

492
00:23:05,251 --> 00:23:06,684
HOMER'S NOT A GOOD GUY.

493
00:23:06,686 --> 00:23:07,084
>> REALLY?

494
00:23:07,086 --> 00:23:08,519
I DON'T KNOW, I THINK HE'S KIND

495

DAY AND STRANGLE YOUR SON AND

498

SIMPSONS" HOMER HITS MARGE?

504
00:23:24,537 --> 00:23:26,570
>> THAT'S PART OF IT.

505
00:23:26,572 --> 00:23:28,405
WHAT ELSE HAPPENS?

506
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:29,707
AROUND, COME ON, LET'S GO

507
00:23:29,709 --> 00:23:31,809
AROUND, WHAT ELSE HAPPENS IN MY

508
00:23:31,811 --> 00:23:32,143
EPISODE?

509
00:23:32,145 --> 00:23:34,879
>> MAYBE MILLHOUSE GETS A COOL

510
00:23:34,881 --> 00:23:36,447
HAIRCUT AND BART GETS JEALOUS?

511
00:23:36,449 --> 00:23:37,782
>> THAT'S GOOD, BUT NOT FOR MY

512
00:23:37,784 --> 00:23:38,115
EPISODE.

513
00:23:41,921 --> 00:23:44,722
SAVE IT FOR SOMETHING ELSE.

514
00:23:44,724 --> 00:23:47,057
HERE'S WHAT I THINK HAPPENS.

515
00:23:47,059 --> 00:23:48,325
BART GOES TO MY DANCE CLASS, BUT

516
00:23:48,327 --> 00:23:49,760
HE'S GOT TEARS IN HIS EYES.

517
00:23:50,096 --> 00:23:54,465
SOMETHING'S WRONG AT HOME.

518
00:23:54,467 --> 00:23:57,434
SO I GO SEE MARGE, AND I CAN

519
00:23:57,436 --> 00:23:57,735
TELL.

520
00:23:57,737 --> 00:23:58,335
SOMEBODY KICKED HER ASS.

521
00:24:01,741 --> 00:24:04,842
>> YOU GOT TO TELL CHIEF WIGHAM!

522
00:24:04,844 --> 00:24:06,844
>> CHIEF WIGHAM IS TOO STUPID

523
00:24:06,846 --> 00:24:07,611
AND FAT.

524
00:24:08,247 --> 00:24:11,015
NO, I TAKE MATTERS INTO MY OWN

525
00:24:11,017 --> 00:24:11,582
HANDS.

526
00:24:11,584 --> 00:24:13,784
SO I'D GO LOOKING FOR HOMER.

527
00:24:13,786 --> 00:24:15,920
>> OH, HE'S PROBABLY AT MO'S.

528
00:24:15,922 --> 00:24:16,954
>> HE IS.

529
00:24:16,956 --> 00:24:20,391
BEEN DRINKING ALL NIGHT.

530
00:24:20,393 --> 00:24:23,127
>> PROBABLY WITH HIS BUDDY

531
00:24:23,129 --> 00:24:23,460
BARNEY.

532
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:24,094
>> YES, WHEELS.

533
00:24:24,096 --> 00:24:24,595
YOU'RE ON A ROLL.

534
00:24:26,065 --> 00:24:33,170
>> I DON'T LOVE THAT.

535
00:24:33,172 --> 00:24:35,506
>> SO I WALK OVER TO HOMER AND I

536
00:24:35,508 --> 00:24:38,008
SAY, "WHAT KIND OF MAN HITS A

537
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:38,342
WOMAN?"

538
00:24:38,344 --> 00:24:39,076
AND HOMER TAKES A SWING AT ME.

539
00:24:42,281 --> 00:24:44,882
BUT I SPIN AND KICK HIM IN THE

540
00:24:44,884 --> 00:24:45,182
CHEST.

541
00:24:45,184 --> 00:24:48,285
AND AS HE LIES DYING ON THE

542
00:24:48,287 --> 00:24:48,953
FLOOR, HE UTTERS HIS FINAL

543
00:24:48,955 --> 00:24:55,960
WORDS.

544
00:24:55,962 --> 00:24:56,327
D'OH!

545
00:24:56,329 --> 00:24:58,395
>> THEN MARGE COMES RUNNING IN.

546
00:24:58,397 --> 00:24:59,730
SHE JUMPS INTO YOUR ARMS AND SHE

547
00:24:59,732 --> 00:25:00,064
SAYS --

548
00:25:00,066 --> 00:25:01,198
>> MY HERO!

549
00:25:03,970 --> 00:25:05,769
YOU KILLED HOMIE!

550
00:25:05,771 --> 00:25:07,271
>> AND BART'S THERE TOO.

551
00:25:07,273 --> 00:25:08,138
HE HUGS YOU AND SAID, "THANKS,

552
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:11,609
DAD."

553
00:25:11,611 --> 00:25:13,143
>> CUT TO NIGHTTIME, ME AND

554
00:25:13,145 --> 00:25:13,644
MARGE ARE IN BED.

555
00:25:16,849 --> 00:25:17,781
SHE SAYS, "READY TO GO TO ROUND

556
00:25:17,783 --> 00:25:20,718
SIX?"

557
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:24,154
AND I SAY, "I GOT THE STAMINA."

558
00:25:24,156 --> 00:25:27,057
>> BECAUSE YOU'RE A DANCER!

559
00:25:27,059 --> 00:25:29,260
>> IT ALL COMES TOGETHER.

560
00:25:29,262 --> 00:25:32,596
JUST LIKE ME AND MARGE.

561
00:25:32,598 --> 00:25:33,931
>> MERRY CHRISTMAS, EVERYONE!

562
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:54,585
SEEMS LIKE YOUR GRANDPA WAS A

563
00:25:54,587 --> 00:25:55,586
SPECIAL GUY.

564
00:25:55,588 --> 00:25:56,320
>> HE REALLY WAS.

565
00:25:56,322 --> 00:25:57,321
THANKS FOR HELPING ME CLEAN OUT

566
00:25:57,323 --> 00:25:58,322
HIS BARN, GUYS.

567
00:25:58,324 --> 00:25:59,323
IT MEANS A LOT.

568
00:25:59,325 --> 00:26:00,090
>> OF COURSE, BENNIE.

569
00:26:00,092 --> 00:26:01,091
THAT'S WHAT NEIGHBORS ARE FOR.

570
00:26:01,093 --> 00:26:02,092
WE KNOW HOW MUCH IT MEANS TO

571
00:26:02,094 --> 00:26:03,093
YOU.

572
00:26:03,095 --> 00:26:04,328
>> HE WAS THE GREATEST GUY I'VE

573
00:26:04,330 --> 00:26:05,596
EVER MET.

574
00:26:05,598 --> 00:26:07,097
I'LL MISS HIM EVERY DAY.

575
00:26:07,099 --> 00:26:08,098
>> WE'RE HERE FOR YOU, BUD.

576
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:14,672
>> WHAT'S THE STORY HERE?

577
00:26:14,674 --> 00:26:15,940
>> YEAH.

578
00:26:15,942 --> 00:26:16,941
THAT'S GRANDPA'S OLD CAR.

579
00:26:16,943 --> 00:26:17,708
HE GOT IT WHEN HE WAS A TEENAGER

580
00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:18,943
IN THE '50s.

581
00:26:18,945 --> 00:26:19,944
IT BROKE DOWN, BUT MAN, HE LOVED

582
00:26:19,946 --> 00:26:21,445
THIS THING.

583
00:26:21,447 --> 00:26:22,446
HE TALKED ABOUT IT LIKE IT WAS

584
00:26:22,448 --> 00:26:24,448
ALIVE.

585
00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:26,717
EVEN HAD A NAME FOR IT.

586
00:26:26,719 --> 00:26:30,220
HE CALLED IT KIRBY.

587
00:26:30,222 --> 00:26:31,689
>> DID THE CAR JUST START ON ITS

588
00:26:31,691 --> 00:26:33,457
OWN?

589
00:26:33,459 --> 00:26:36,460
>> I THINK IT JUST SMILED.

590
00:26:36,462 --> 00:26:37,194
GRANDPA SAID IT WAS MAGIC, BUT I

591
00:26:37,196 --> 00:26:40,431
THOUGHT HE WAS CRAZY.

592
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,706
>> I THINK HE WANTS US ALL TO

593
00:26:48,708 --> 00:26:49,707
GET IN.

594
00:26:49,709 --> 00:26:50,441
>> WHOA, WHOA!

595
00:26:50,443 --> 00:26:55,946

596
00:26:55,948 --> 00:26:57,681
>> WHAT HAPPENED?

597
00:26:57,683 --> 00:26:58,215
>> THAT'S ODD.

598
00:26:58,217 --> 00:27:03,187
MAYBE WE JUST GOT TO --

599
00:27:03,189 --> 00:27:03,954
>> LOOKS LIKE KIBY DON'T WANT US

600
00:27:03,956 --> 00:27:04,955
IN THERE.

601
00:27:04,957 --> 00:27:06,190
>> I'M TRYING TO UNLOCK IT.

602
00:27:06,192 --> 00:27:06,924

00:27:07,927 --> 00:27:14,732
>> 1958.

605
00:27:14,734 --> 00:27:15,966
>> WHY WON'T THE CAR DOOR OPEN?

606
00:27:15,968 --> 00:27:20,938
>> LET ME TRY.

607
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:23,574
DID HE JUST SMACK MY BUTT?

608
00:27:23,576 --> 00:27:24,375
¶ I LIKE BIG BUTTS AND I CANNOT

609
00:27:24,377 --> 00:27:26,710

610
00:27:26,712 --> 00:27:29,446
>> KIRBY!

00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:32,416
WELL.

614
00:27:32,418 --> 00:27:33,217
>> I REMEMBER YOU SAYING HE WAS

615
00:27:33,219 --> 00:27:37,454
THE GREATEST GUY YOU EVER MET.

616
00:27:37,456 --> 00:27:38,455
>> HEY, WHY DON'T WE ALL LISTEN

617
00:27:38,457 --> 00:27:39,189
TO SOME TUNES?

618
00:27:39,191 --> 00:27:45,562
¶ SNOW IS FALLING WHITE ¶

FIRST OF ALL, I JUST WANT TO

676
00:29:38,344 --> 00:29:39,576
SAY, I OBVIOUSLY HAD TOO MUCH TO

677
00:29:39,578 --> 00:29:41,945
DRINK AT THE HOLIDAY PARTY.

678
00:29:41,947 --> 00:29:45,482
AND MY BEHAVIOR WAS INEXCUSABLE.

679
00:29:45,484 --> 00:29:47,985
>> YEAH, MINE TOO, MY BAD.

680
00:29:49,922 --> 00:29:51,955

00:29:55,394 --> 00:29:56,059
GIRLIE FOR ONCE.

684
00:29:56,061 --> 00:29:58,595
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT I MEANT.

685
00:29:58,597 --> 00:30:00,597
BUT I KNOW IT WAS HIGHLY

686
00:30:00,599 --> 00:30:01,031
INAPPROPRIATE.

687
00:30:01,033 --> 00:30:02,733
>> WELL, I THINK IT MEANT YOU'RE

688
00:30:02,735 --> 00:30:04,168
A PIG AND THAT'S WHY THEY FIRED

689
00:30:04,170 --> 00:30:07,471

690
00:30:07,473 --> 00:30:10,908
>> HEY, DONNA.

691
00:30:10,910 --> 00:30:12,609
I SAW THAT DRESS TOO.

692
00:30:12,611 --> 00:30:14,711
I BELIEVE I ALSO SAID SOMETHING

693
00:30:14,713 --> 00:30:18,882
TO THE EFFECT OF, MM, MM, MM,

694

THEN I SHOOK MY HEAD, I DID A

698
00:30:26,792 --> 00:30:29,193
LITTLE DANCE, AND I SAID, DON'T

699
00:30:29,195 --> 00:30:34,331
YOU HURT NOBODY WITH THAT THING.

700
00:30:34,333 --> 00:30:34,932
THAT WAS WEIRD, MY BAD.

701
00:30:34,934 --> 00:30:35,699
>> OH, CHARLIE, YOU'RE JUST TOO

PROMOTION YOU ASKED FOR.

709
00:30:47,713 --> 00:30:49,913
I GUESS THAT WAS OUT OF LINE.

710
00:30:49,915 --> 00:30:51,381
>> OH, YOU GUESS?

711
00:30:51,383 --> 00:30:51,748
SERIOUSLY?

712
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:54,017
GO TO HELL, MARK.

713
00:30:54,019 --> 00:30:55,986
>> OKAY, LET'S TRY TO KEEP IT

714
00:30:55,988 --> 00:30:59,389
CORDIAL HERE, GUYS.

715
00:30:59,391 --> 00:31:02,593
>> MICHELLE MY BELLE, I KNOW I

716
00:31:02,595 --> 00:31:03,827
BASICALLY SAID THE SAME THING,

717
00:31:03,829 --> 00:31:05,395
EXCEPT I LAID ON THE FLOOR, PUT

718
00:31:05,397 --> 00:31:07,431
A DOLLAR BILL IN MY MOUTH, AND I

719
00:31:07,433 --> 00:31:11,235
SAID, MMM-MMM-MMM, TRY TO PICK

720
00:31:11,237 --> 00:31:13,337
IT UP WITH NO HANDS, SHELLEY.

721
00:31:13,339 --> 00:31:15,205
THEN I SHOOK MY HEAD, DID A

722
00:31:15,207 --> 00:31:16,340
LITTLE DANCE, AND I SAID, DON'T

723
00:31:16,342 --> 00:31:17,074
YOU HURT ME WITH THAT THING, I'M

724
00:31:17,076 --> 00:31:19,943
COOL.

725
00:31:19,945 --> 00:31:20,677
>> YOU STILL OWE ME ANOTHER TRY,

726
00:31:20,679 --> 00:31:23,580
CHARLIE.

727
00:31:23,582 --> 00:31:24,281
>> HOW IS THAT BASICALLY THE

728
00:31:24,283 --> 00:31:27,150
SAME THING?

729
00:31:27,152 --> 00:31:30,087
>> COME ON, PHIL, YOU CAN'T FIRE

730
00:31:30,089 --> 00:31:31,588
CHARLIE, HE'S JUST BEING

00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:31,955
CHARLIE.

732
00:31:31,957 --> 00:31:33,023
>> THE DECISION CAME FROM

733
00:31:33,025 --> 00:31:35,425
UPSTAIRS, THERE'S NOTHING I CAN

734
00:31:35,427 --> 00:31:35,692
DO.

735
00:31:35,694 --> 00:31:37,561
>> DAVID, I KNOW WHEN I MET YOUR

00:31:37,563 --> 00:31:40,163
HUSBAND AT THE HOLIDAY PARTY,

737
00:31:40,165 --> 00:31:42,733
YOU KNOW, WE KIND OF HAD A

738
00:31:42,735 --> 00:31:43,333
AWKWARD EXCHANGE.

739
00:31:43,335 --> 00:31:45,636
>> OH, YOU MEAN WHEN YOU ASKED

740
00:31:45,638 --> 00:31:48,672
WHO THE GUY WAS IN OUR

741
00:31:48,674 --> 00:31:49,106
RELATIONSHIP?

742
00:31:49,108 --> 00:31:50,307
>> YEAH.

743
00:31:50,309 --> 00:31:52,542
>> IT'S A LITTLE MORE THAN

744
00:31:52,544 --> 00:31:52,909
AWKWARD.

745
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:54,077
>> SERIOUSLY, MARK?

746
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:55,345
WHAT A DUMBASS.

747
00:31:55,347 --> 00:31:57,614
>> I SAID IT, I WAS WRONG, I GET

748
00:31:57,616 --> 00:31:57,981
IT NOW.

749
00:31:57,983 --> 00:31:59,916
>> NOW, NOW, NOW.

750
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:01,151
I THINK I KNOW WHERE MARK IS

751
00:32:01,153 --> 00:32:02,352
COMING FROM HERE, BECAUSE DAVID,

752
00:32:02,354 --> 00:32:04,755

HUSBAND SOMETHING LIKE, LOOK

754

HERE, OLD CHARLIE IS STRAIGHTER

755
00:32:10,329 --> 00:32:10,827
THAN A CHOPSTICK.

756
00:32:10,829 --> 00:32:12,763
BUT IF WE WAS IN THE JOINT?

757
00:32:12,765 --> 00:32:13,163
MMM-MMM-MMM!

758
00:32:13,165 --> 00:32:15,032
I SAW YOU AND YOUR HUSBAND

759
00:32:15,034 --> 00:32:16,633
KNICK-KNACK AND PADDY-WHACK.

760
00:32:16,635 --> 00:32:17,401
BECAUSE YOU'D BE GIVING THIS DOG

761
00:32:17,403 --> 00:32:20,203
A BONE.

762
00:32:20,205 --> 00:32:21,905
THEN I WOULD SHAKE MY HEAD, DO A

763
00:32:21,907 --> 00:32:23,340
LITTLE DANCE, AND I WOULD SAY,

764

DON'T YOU HURT EACH OTHER WITH

765
00:32:25,210 --> 00:32:26,276

766
00:32:26,278 --> 00:32:28,378
YOU GOT TO FORGIVE ME.

767
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:30,047
>> SERIOUSLY, CHARLIE, IT WOULD

768
00:32:30,049 --> 00:32:31,448
BE AN HONOR TO SERVE WITH YOU.

769
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:33,617
>> YOU CANNOT FIRE CHARLIE.

770
00:32:33,619 --> 00:32:35,652
CAN'T YOU JUST GIVE HIM MARK'S

771
00:32:35,654 --> 00:32:36,386

>> ACTUALLY, NO, CHARLIE.

827
00:34:02,207 --> 00:34:04,641
YOU'RE BEING FIRED BECAUSE YOU

828

THERE'S A FOREIGN OBJECT IN THE

1343
00:53:54,065 --> 00:53:54,797
PATIENT'S ABDOMEN.

1344
00:53:54,799 --> 00:53:58,567

>> OH, MY GOD, OKAY.

1346

>> DON'T MAKE LESLIE CRY!

1352
00:54:10,147 --> 00:54:11,113

00:54:11,115 --> 00:54:14,616
A VICTORIAN GHOST.

1354

>> I AM AWAKE.

00:54:33,671 --> 00:54:35,003
OF COURSE I'M AWAKE, BECAUSE I

1361
00:54:35,005 --> 00:54:37,906
WASN'T GIVEN ENOUGH ANESTHESIA.

1362

1371
00:54:52,757 --> 00:54:53,856
ARTERY WHEN YOU SAT UP.

1372

>> SHH, I'M NOT DONE.

1373
