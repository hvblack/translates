1
00:00:02,022 --> 00:00:05,530
Cheers is filmed
before a live studio audience.

2
00:00:05,530 --> 00:00:07,844
Hello.

3
00:00:07,878 --> 00:00:10,637
Carla, what are you doing in?
You're not due in
for another hour.

4
00:00:10,637 --> 00:00:13,216
I had to get out of my house.
It was a zoo.

5
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:17,721
Serafina took the hedge clippers
to the shag carpet.

6
00:00:17,755 --> 00:00:20,857
Little Lotte unplugged
the refrigerator

7
00:00:20,892 --> 00:00:24,408
to see if frozen peas
melt faster than ice cream.

8
00:00:24,408 --> 00:00:28,229
Gino made a volcano
for a science project
in the microwave.

9
00:00:28,229 --> 00:00:32,041
And on top of
everything else,
me and Eddie had a big fight.

10
00:00:32,041 --> 00:00:37,383
- Oh, geez, what about?
- He had the nerve to say I don't
know how to control my kids.

11
00:00:38,175 --> 00:00:42,245
I don't know.
We just
can't seem to see
eye to eye on the right way
to discipline 'em.

12
00:00:42,279 --> 00:00:44,411
Carla, it's for you.
Oh...

13
00:00:48,119 --> 00:00:52,922
Hello.
I thought we settled this.

14
00:00:52,957 --> 00:00:55,756
No, you definitely
cannot hit him.

15
00:00:55,756 --> 00:00:58,442
No, you cannot lock
him in the closet,

16
00:00:58,442 --> 00:01:02,026
and you absolutely
cannot wash
his mouth out
with soap.

17
00:01:02,026 --> 00:01:06,520
Anne-Marie, you untie
your stepfather right now!

18
00:01:14,344 --> 00:01:16,885
 Making your way
in the world today 

19
00:01:16,885 --> 00:01:19,882
 Takes everything you've got

20
00:01:19,882 --> 00:01:22,682
 Taking a break
from all your worries 

21
00:01:22,682 --> 00:01:25,839
 Sure would help a lot

22
00:01:25,873 --> 00:01:30,076
 Wouldn't you like
to get away? 

23
00:01:31,395 --> 00:01:33,997
 Sometimes you want to go

24
00:01:34,031 --> 00:01:38,226
 Where everybody
knows your name 

25
00:01:39,253 --> 00:01:43,356
 And they're always glad
you came 

26
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:46,347
 You want to be
where you can see 

27
00:01:46,347 --> 00:01:48,728
 Our troubles
are all the same 

28
00:01:48,763 --> 00:01:53,831
 You want to be where everybody
knows your name 

29
00:01:54,101 --> 00:01:56,569
 You want to go
where people know 

30
00:01:56,603 --> 00:01:59,238
 People are all the same

31
00:01:59,273 --> 00:02:04,711
 You want to go where
everybody knows your name. 

32
00:02:24,877 --> 00:02:26,608
Cheers.

33
00:02:26,608 --> 00:02:28,642
Yeah, hi, Carla.

34
00:02:30,454 --> 00:02:32,541
Bye, Carla.

35
00:02:32,523 --> 00:02:34,305
Hey, what was that about?

36
00:02:34,305 --> 00:02:38,511
Uh, it's just... Carla
reminding us it's her night off.

37
00:02:43,583 --> 00:02:47,620
Normie, you, uh...
you ever feel
like we're getting
in a little rut here?

38
00:02:47,654 --> 00:02:48,854
How do you mean, Cliff?

39
00:02:48,889 --> 00:02:51,524
Well, every day, we come
into the same bar,

40
00:02:51,558 --> 00:02:54,059
sit on the same stools,
drink beer, night after...

41
00:02:54,093 --> 00:02:56,579
I mean, there's got
to be something
a little bit more
to life.

42
00:02:56,613 --> 00:03:01,287
Cliffie, for
the last time,
I am not changing
barstools with you.

43
00:03:02,235 --> 00:03:05,370
Well, I, for one,
applaud your desire
to shake things up a bit, Cliff.

44
00:03:05,405 --> 00:03:08,886
Sometimes I think
I'd give anything for a change--
no matter how slight--

45
00:03:08,886 --> 00:03:11,927
in this deadly,
unvarying routine of life.

46
00:03:11,961 --> 00:03:14,840
- What can I get
you, Dr. Crane?
- The usual.

47
00:03:15,716 --> 00:03:19,101
So, Sam, uh,
anything
interesting in the corporate
newsletter there?

48
00:03:19,135 --> 00:03:22,204
Oh, well, let's see here.
Uh... yes.

49
00:03:22,238 --> 00:03:25,207
Did you know that the, uh,
corporation that owns this bar

50
00:03:25,241 --> 00:03:30,005
purchases one percent of all
the string made in America?

51
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,425
Whoo! My blood
pressure, Sam, please.

52
00:03:34,501 --> 00:03:38,931
Aw, come on, guys.
There must be something
going on in our lives
that we can talk about.

53
00:03:38,931 --> 00:03:40,539
Well, Norm, what
did you do today?

54
00:03:40,539 --> 00:03:43,593
Well, I just about finished
the first coat of paint
at Cliff's apartment.

55
00:03:43,627 --> 00:03:46,178
Oh, yawns all around.
Next?

56
00:03:46,212 --> 00:03:47,742
Oh, I got a ticket this weekend.

57
00:03:47,742 --> 00:03:49,248
Oh, Woody, we're not
that desperate.

58
00:03:49,283 --> 00:03:51,600
Ah, speak for yourself.
Parking or moving?

59
00:03:51,635 --> 00:03:53,894
Parking, but it was
my own fault.

60
00:03:53,894 --> 00:03:58,828
I, uh... I let the meter run out
while I was watching them film
Spencer for Hire.

61
00:03:58,828 --> 00:04:02,696
What?
Spencer for Hire?
That's my favorite!

62
00:04:02,696 --> 00:04:05,464
- Was Robert Urich there?
- Oh, yeah.
It's his show.

63
00:04:05,499 --> 00:04:07,917
And you saw him?
Oh, my God!

64
00:04:07,951 --> 00:04:10,044
Oh, eh, well,
Normie over here's met him.

65
00:04:10,044 --> 00:04:12,482
You lie!
What's he really like?

66
00:04:12,482 --> 00:04:17,226
Well, you know,
he just sped past
me in his BMW,
but he seemed like a
real courteous driver.

67
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:19,295
You know,
I've heard that about him.

68
00:04:19,330 --> 00:04:22,211
Oh, would...
would you stop it?

69
00:04:22,211 --> 00:04:25,635
I mean, the guy puts
his pants on one leg at a time
just like everybody else.

70
00:04:25,669 --> 00:04:28,275
Why is everybody so gaga
over actors?

71
00:04:28,275 --> 00:04:33,741
Hold it, hold it.
I'm still picturing him with his
pants down around his ankles.

72
00:04:35,545 --> 00:04:38,244
So, Wood, how long
did you watch them film?

73
00:04:38,244 --> 00:04:41,230
Till some guy came
up and put me in one
of the crowd scenes.

74
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:45,654
Now, wait...
You were in a
scene with him?!
I can't believe it!
Woody!

75
00:04:45,688 --> 00:04:48,248
Whoa! You're going
to be on national TV?
Weren't you nervous?

76
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:51,044
Oh, yeah, I was,
until I talked to Mr. Urich.

77
00:04:51,044 --> 00:04:54,487
You talked to him?
I'm dying!
What did he say?

78
00:04:54,487 --> 00:04:56,465
He said it was a cold day.

79
00:04:56,499 --> 00:04:58,080
And what did you say?

80
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,878
- I agreed with him.
- Ooh, good move.

81
00:05:00,638 --> 00:05:02,572
Then I loaned him
my gloves.

82
00:05:02,606 --> 00:05:04,584
- Yeah? What'd he say?
- Thanks.

83
00:05:04,584 --> 00:05:07,458
Oh! Can't you
just hear him?

84
00:05:07,458 --> 00:05:09,429
You know, the truth is
I know how you feel.

85
00:05:09,463 --> 00:05:11,787
I felt the same way
about Haley Mills...

86
00:05:11,787 --> 00:05:13,913
when I was 12.

87
00:05:13,913 --> 00:05:17,039
When weren't you 12?

88
00:05:21,475 --> 00:05:23,564
Hello, ladies, can I help you?

89
00:05:23,564 --> 00:05:26,245
We're here about
the book club.

90
00:05:26,279 --> 00:05:28,748
Oh, you probably
have us confused
with the public library.

91
00:05:28,782 --> 00:05:30,400
Happens all the time.
It's two blocks down.

92
00:05:30,434 --> 00:05:32,234
- This is Cheers, isn't it?
- Oh, yes. But there's
no way...

93
00:05:32,269 --> 00:05:34,063
Excuse me. I'm Rebecca Howe.

94
00:05:34,063 --> 00:05:35,805
- You must be Mrs. Miller.
- Yes.

95
00:05:35,805 --> 00:05:39,148
We're here to make
the final arrangements
for our Sunday night
meetings.

96
00:05:39,148 --> 00:05:41,077
Great. Well, let me
show you the back room.

97
00:05:41,111 --> 00:05:43,095
I hope everything
suits your needs.

98
00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:46,285
Yoo-hoo! Uh, Miss Howe, can I
speak to you for a minute?

99
00:05:46,285 --> 00:05:49,560
Uh, you go on ahead,
and I'll join you
in just a minute.

100
00:05:49,836 --> 00:05:52,838
What is... what is this
about a-a book club?

101
00:05:52,838 --> 00:05:57,576
Ever since I
arrived here,
I have been
desperately trying
to upgrade the
clientele in this bar.

102
00:05:57,611 --> 00:05:59,311
We will upgrade
some other night.

103
00:05:59,346 --> 00:06:02,498
Sunday is the night that we have
our weekly pool tournament.

104
00:06:02,532 --> 00:06:03,883
You said it.
That's right.

105
00:06:03,917 --> 00:06:05,936
Well, just have
your pool tournament
another night.

106
00:06:05,936 --> 00:06:10,639
Oh, right!
Like we can, uh, rearrange
our schedule here. Right.

107
00:06:10,673 --> 00:06:11,673
Well, what about
Monday night?

108
00:06:11,708 --> 00:06:15,350
Yo, guys, we got a lady
right off the boat here,
doesn't speak any English.

109
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:17,113
Tell her what happens
Monday night, will you, please?

110
00:06:17,113 --> 00:06:19,081
Football!

111
00:06:19,115 --> 00:06:21,729
- How about Tuesday?
- Darts Night.

112
00:06:21,729 --> 00:06:25,354
- Wednesday?
- Well, recovery
from Darts Night.

113
00:06:26,056 --> 00:06:27,616
Thursday's Poker Night.

114
00:06:27,616 --> 00:06:29,039
Friday's a night
to howl.

115
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:32,795
And, uh,
Saturday night
is Date Night,
so, uh, where does
that leave us?

116
00:06:32,829 --> 00:06:34,961
Horny on Sundays.
Yo.

117
00:06:35,765 --> 00:06:38,517
The book club will meet
here on Sunday, period.

118
00:06:38,552 --> 00:06:41,933
- Miss Howe?
We have a few questions.
- Of course.

119
00:06:41,933 --> 00:06:43,422
- Say, excuse me.
I don't mean to be rude,

120
00:06:43,456 --> 00:06:46,699
- but, uh, do you ladies
comprise a book club?
- Yes, that's right.

121
00:06:46,709 --> 00:06:49,311
Well, the salon
of the '80s.

122
00:06:49,346 --> 00:06:53,315
You know, it's encouraging
to meet a group of adults
who still read
in this day and age

123
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:55,909
rather than pay homage
to the great god, television.

124
00:06:55,909 --> 00:06:57,826
- I can't tell you how
heartened I am...
- Excuse me.

125
00:06:57,826 --> 00:07:00,773
I have a cigarette
going back there.

126
00:07:03,093 --> 00:07:04,344
- Of course.

127
00:07:04,344 --> 00:07:08,273
- Hey, Woody, when you were on the
set there, you see
any famous actresses?
Huh?
- No.

128
00:07:08,273 --> 00:07:11,596
What about all the drug stuff
you hear
about in show business--
see any of that?
- No.

129
00:07:11,596 --> 00:07:15,204
There's a lot of that
juicy backstabbing
going on on the set?
- No.

130
00:07:15,238 --> 00:07:18,588
Hey, guys, you got to hear
these stories.

131
00:07:19,559 --> 00:07:23,095
So, uh, Normie,
you think you'll be,
uh, through, uh, painting
my apartment tomorrow, or what?

132
00:07:23,129 --> 00:07:24,163
Yeah, I'll finish
up tomorrow.

133
00:07:24,197 --> 00:07:26,265
Can you have a,
uh, check ready
for me, Cliff?

134
00:07:26,299 --> 00:07:29,602
Well, I'll, uh...
give you one now.

135
00:07:29,636 --> 00:07:33,789
Uh, okay, pay to the order
of Norman Peterson...

136
00:07:33,823 --> 00:07:36,158
one zillion dollars!

137
00:07:36,192 --> 00:07:40,648
There you go!
Buy yourself a yacht,
young fella.

138
00:07:40,964 --> 00:07:44,527
Cliff, uh,
you are going to pay me
for this job, aren't you?

139
00:07:44,527 --> 00:07:48,249
Hey, Normie, look, you, uh,
didn't charge me last year
when you painted Ma's house,
did you?

140
00:07:48,249 --> 00:07:50,028
Well, that was before
I was a professional.

141
00:07:50,028 --> 00:07:52,741
Oh, I'll say. We never did get
those windows unstuck.

142
00:07:52,776 --> 00:07:54,677
Cliff, I finished
half your place.

143
00:07:54,711 --> 00:07:57,346
I'll be happy to
come by and finish
the rest of it, okay?

144
00:07:57,380 --> 00:08:01,116
I'd appreciate a check.
If you've got a problem
with that, why don't we work out
a payment schedule right now?

145
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:03,324
Look, uh, Norm,
money is not a problem.

146
00:08:03,324 --> 00:08:05,787
You know that. It's just,
uh, well, I'm not a cheap man.

147
00:08:05,822 --> 00:08:09,790
Oh, a statement I'll wager
has never been uttered
by anyone but a cheap man.

148
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:15,004
Look, Norm, if I knew you were
going to charge me for all this,
I would've demanded
a better job.

149
00:08:15,004 --> 00:08:16,782
Now, I've been
letting you slide, buddy.

150
00:08:16,817 --> 00:08:20,218
If you think
the work is so worthless,
just finish it yourself, Cliff.

151
00:08:20,253 --> 00:08:21,908
Well, uh,
not that I couldn't.

152
00:08:21,971 --> 00:08:27,420
I mean, it doesn't exactly take
a Phi Beta Kappa
to stick a brush in a bucket,
slap it on a wall, does it?

153
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:29,064
I mean, any monkey
can do that, huh?

154
00:08:29,064 --> 00:08:34,139
Oh, yeah, as opposed to the high level
of skill and precision it takes
to shove a postcard
through a slot.

155
00:08:35,785 --> 00:08:38,499
That's enough, enough,
okay, enough, Normie.

156
00:08:38,499 --> 00:08:39,971
I'm, uh, waiting
for an apology.

157
00:08:40,006 --> 00:08:43,077
Fine. I'll drop it in the mail.
That way, you'll never get it.

158
00:08:44,762 --> 00:08:47,713
I certainly don't have to
stand here and take that.

159
00:08:47,748 --> 00:08:50,866
Mm, good news, everyone.
I've found a way
to make him leave.

160
00:08:50,901 --> 00:08:53,169
You'll rue this day, my friend.

161
00:08:53,169 --> 00:08:57,366
I am going to make
a laughingstock out of you
in front of your whole
pseudo-profession.

162
00:08:57,366 --> 00:09:00,401
Very Joan Crawford.

163
00:09:08,652 --> 00:09:11,540
Oh, glad you guys
could make it.
Hey, wipe your feet there,
would you?

164
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:13,823
Hey, Mr. C., uh, what time's
the game start?

165
00:09:13,857 --> 00:09:15,257
Oh, any minute now,
there, Woody.

166
00:09:15,291 --> 00:09:20,155
Hey, look at this place.
So this is what
you finally picked out, huh?

167
00:09:20,155 --> 00:09:22,380
- Oh, yeah.
Was it everything
you'd thought it be,
there, Sammy?

168
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:24,320
No, no, I like it.

169
00:09:24,968 --> 00:09:29,205
Well, you know,
I've been meaning
to have you guys over here
for a while now.

170
00:09:29,239 --> 00:09:34,099
I want to take
this opportunity to, uh,
make a public apology
to my pal Normie here.

171
00:09:34,099 --> 00:09:36,412
I got out of line
a little bit,
uh, the other night
in the bar,

172
00:09:36,446 --> 00:09:39,849
and, uh, I just hope you can,
uh, find it in your heart
to forgive me, there, Norm.

173
00:09:39,883 --> 00:09:41,917
Don't worry about it.
I said some stupid things, too.

174
00:09:41,951 --> 00:09:45,891
All right!
Hey, hey, see
that apple
in the underwear
commercial there?

175
00:09:45,891 --> 00:09:48,766
He played a doorman
in my Spencer for Hire.

176
00:09:48,766 --> 00:09:51,005
Talk about range.

177
00:09:51,005 --> 00:09:54,456
- You know, it's actually
a good paint job, Cliff.
- Oh, yeah, thanks, there, Normie.

178
00:09:54,456 --> 00:09:57,309
You know, I, uh... you know,
I thought I could do this
by myself,

179
00:09:57,309 --> 00:10:02,594
but, uh, when I started,
I realized
that I needed somebody
with your specialized skills
and talents, eh...

180
00:10:02,594 --> 00:10:04,956
Well, well, takes a big man
to admit that, Cliff.
Ah...

181
00:10:04,991 --> 00:10:09,795
- Glad you appreciate the
value of professional labor.
- Oh, yeah,
I sure do, uh...

182
00:10:09,829 --> 00:10:14,741
Listen, if you guys don't mind,
I'd like to introduce you
to the, uh, skilled artisan
who did this fine work.

183
00:10:14,833 --> 00:10:17,353
Yeah, he's in the, uh, bathroom
over here, finishing up.

184
00:10:17,353 --> 00:10:20,033
Uh, hey, Duane, come out here.

185
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:00,289
Cheers.

186
00:11:00,626 --> 00:11:02,825
Oh, hang on a second.

187
00:11:02,825 --> 00:11:05,224
Mr. Peterson,
it's Mr. Clavin.

188
00:11:05,258 --> 00:11:09,228
Come on, now,
it's been a whole week.
Maybe he wants
to make up.

189
00:11:09,262 --> 00:11:11,486
Take a message.

190
00:11:12,238 --> 00:11:14,931
Can I take a message?

191
00:11:15,953 --> 00:11:18,016
Okeydokey.

192
00:11:23,018 --> 00:11:25,081
What'd he say?

193
00:11:34,621 --> 00:11:37,083
What are you
doing, there?

194
00:11:37,083 --> 00:11:41,883
Miss Howe put moi
in charge of refreshments
for the book club.

195
00:11:41,883 --> 00:11:45,982
- Well, yeah, but
what are those?
- Finger sandwiches.

196
00:11:46,016 --> 00:11:50,368
You know, the part
that takes
the most time is getting
that middle knuckle right.

197
00:11:51,155 --> 00:11:55,557
Woody, they don't
actually have to
look like fingers.

198
00:11:55,592 --> 00:11:58,088
Yeah, right, Sam.

199
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:03,816
Boy, it hardly feels
like a Sunday
without a pool cue
in my hand.
Yeah.

200
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:06,299
Why don't we go
to Old Town Tavern,
shoot some stick?

201
00:12:06,299 --> 00:12:11,009
What, are you kidding?
Tonight happens to be
Woody's big debut
on Spencer for Hire.

202
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:16,079
Can't imagine what
it's going to be like
to see, uh, somebody
we actually know
up on that TV screen.

203
00:12:16,113 --> 00:12:19,604
Well, Norm, I'm-I'm
loathe to chide you
for your short memory,

204
00:12:19,604 --> 00:12:22,184
but I appeared on the tube
just a few short weeks ago.

205
00:12:22,184 --> 00:12:24,665
Oh, well, yeah,
Frasier, uh, no offense,

206
00:12:24,665 --> 00:12:28,407
but a bunch
of do-gooders sitting around
jabbering about
a nuclear freeze
is one thing.

207
00:12:28,441 --> 00:12:30,877
We're talking
prime time
cop show here.

208
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,678
Evening, ladies.

209
00:12:34,678 --> 00:12:36,765
I'm really excited
about you being here.

210
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,367
The rest of your group's
already in the back.

211
00:12:38,401 --> 00:12:42,194
Oh, thank you
very much.
It should be
a special evening.

212
00:12:42,194 --> 00:12:46,987
Tonight, we're discussing
English agrarian life
before the Reform Bill

213
00:12:46,987 --> 00:12:49,785
as portrayed
in Elliot's Middlemarch.

214
00:12:49,785 --> 00:12:51,397
Would you care
to join us?

215
00:12:51,431 --> 00:12:54,327
You know, actually,
we were just discussing
that at the bar,

216
00:12:54,327 --> 00:12:56,770
and I'm a little
burned out on it.
Oh.

217
00:12:58,705 --> 00:13:00,506
Miss Howe?

218
00:13:00,541 --> 00:13:03,282
I put the tea
and the lemonade
in the back for the ladies,

219
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:06,561
and, uh, these
are ready for you.
- Thank you, Woody.

220
00:13:09,299 --> 00:13:12,977
Woody, when I said
I wanted finger sandwich...

221
00:13:13,604 --> 00:13:16,294
These look delicious.

222
00:13:18,709 --> 00:13:20,509
Excuse me.
Yes, yes, yes.

223
00:13:20,543 --> 00:13:23,930
- I'm missing something
in my tea.
- All right, uh,
lemon here? Sugar?

224
00:13:23,964 --> 00:13:25,631
A touch of brandy.

225
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:29,652
Ah. Well, all right.
There you go.

226
00:13:29,686 --> 00:13:31,637
Don't be shy.

227
00:13:32,622 --> 00:13:34,853
- Thank you very much.
- Bye-bye.

228
00:13:34,853 --> 00:13:38,059
Hey, hey, everybody.
My Spencer for Hire is on.

229
00:13:38,595 --> 00:13:41,296
- Woody, when's
your big scene?
- It's hard to tell.

230
00:13:41,331 --> 00:13:44,666
You know, in television,
we shoot out of sequence.

231
00:13:45,969 --> 00:13:49,404
I wonder if you might
have a little gin back there.

232
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:51,357
Gin, in a bar?

233
00:13:51,428 --> 00:13:53,209
Uh... whoa!

234
00:13:53,193 --> 00:13:54,921
It's your lucky day.
There you go.

235
00:13:54,921 --> 00:13:58,786
Thank you.
See, I've had this cold.

236
00:13:59,749 --> 00:14:03,072
That's, that's the
street I was on!
That's my scene!

237
00:14:03,072 --> 00:14:05,121
Woody! Woody! Woody!

238
00:14:05,155 --> 00:14:07,623
There I am!
Where?!
Where?!
Where are you?

239
00:14:07,658 --> 00:14:10,209
There! Right there
in the corner!
That's a fire hydrant.

240
00:14:10,243 --> 00:14:12,291
No, no, right next to it.
That's my sleeve!

241
00:14:12,291 --> 00:14:15,480
- Woody, we can't see your face.
- What?! Don't you
recognize my shirt?

242
00:14:15,515 --> 00:14:18,152
That distinctive
plain white one?

243
00:14:18,501 --> 00:14:20,502
All right, well,
now it's gone
to commercial.
You missed it.

244
00:14:20,536 --> 00:14:21,899
Oh, Woody,
you telling me...?
That's it?!

245
00:14:21,899 --> 00:14:24,883
- Hey, you know,
lots of people
have white shirts.
- And arms.

246
00:14:24,883 --> 00:14:27,293
How do we know
you were even
on the show, Woody?

247
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:29,094
Of course I was.

248
00:14:29,129 --> 00:14:31,130
Oh, you got to believe me.

249
00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:34,674
Oh, yeah,
I bet that's you
driving the little chuck wagon
right now, huh?

250
00:14:38,655 --> 00:14:41,448
No, no, no. I swear.
I met Robert Urich
and everything.

251
00:14:41,448 --> 00:14:44,482
Yeah, Wood, let us know
when your pants
are on Dallas.

252
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:55,989
 What shall we do
with a drunken sailor? 

253
00:14:56,063 --> 00:14:58,285
 Earl-aye in the morning?

254
00:14:58,285 --> 00:15:00,138
 Hey-oh, up she rises

255
00:15:00,138 --> 00:15:02,626
God, not again.

256
00:15:02,626 --> 00:15:05,390
What the hell is happening
to our book club?

257
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:09,192
I think it had
something to do
with that last
round of margaritas.

258
00:15:12,121 --> 00:15:15,280
That does it!
I am putting a stop
to this right now.

259
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:19,628
No, let me handle this.
You're not used to
dealing with those rowdy
book club types.

260
00:15:20,130 --> 00:15:22,525
Sam, this is my bar.
I am in charge.

261
00:15:22,525 --> 00:15:25,634
All right.
I am perfectly capable
of restoring order.

262
00:15:25,668 --> 00:15:28,399
You are so cute
when you're macho.

263
00:15:28,955 --> 00:15:31,573
Hey, Woods.
I'm just curious, um,

264
00:15:31,608 --> 00:15:34,633
did a lot of other shirts
audition for that role?

265
00:15:34,828 --> 00:15:39,664
Hey, Woody,
there's an article in here
that says your shirt
is now dating
Morgan Fairchild.

266
00:15:39,664 --> 00:15:42,486
But she says
they're just friends.

267
00:15:43,086 --> 00:15:46,303
Come on, guys.
I'm telling you,
I really did do it.

268
00:15:46,303 --> 00:15:48,347
Sure thing, Woody.

269
00:15:51,411 --> 00:15:53,426
Cheers.

270
00:15:54,063 --> 00:15:56,897
Oh, hi, Robert Urich.

271
00:15:57,867 --> 00:16:00,787
Yeah, yeah, this is
your old pal, Woody.

272
00:16:00,787 --> 00:16:04,566
Oh, well, I thought
your performance
was wonderful tonight, too.

273
00:16:04,566 --> 00:16:06,249
Yeah.
Yeah.

274
00:16:06,249 --> 00:16:11,530
What? Oh, uh, yeah, that shirt?
Yeah, I-I picked it out myself.

275
00:16:11,564 --> 00:16:13,749
Uh, Sears, I think.

276
00:16:14,667 --> 00:16:17,601
Yeah, okay, well,
thanks for calling.
I'll see you around the studio.

277
00:16:17,601 --> 00:16:19,881
All right, bye.

278
00:16:19,881 --> 00:16:22,658
See?
How could we have
ever doubted him?

279
00:16:22,692 --> 00:16:25,227
Boy, do we have egg
on our face, huh?

280
00:16:25,577 --> 00:16:27,416
Go on!

281
00:16:27,416 --> 00:16:31,965
Boy you sure, uh...
you sure taught them
a lesson, didn't you?

282
00:16:31,965 --> 00:16:35,487
By the way, what,
what do they do
with a drunken sailor?

283
00:16:35,522 --> 00:16:37,923
Malone?
Get in there.

284
00:16:37,958 --> 00:16:41,335
Oh, so you do need me, huh?
The right man for the job.

285
00:16:41,335 --> 00:16:45,248
No, no, no.
You don't understand.
They asked for you.

286
00:16:46,482 --> 00:16:49,167
They did?
Yes, they said,

287
00:16:49,202 --> 00:16:51,185
"Send in..."

288
00:16:52,271 --> 00:16:56,452
Did you hear that?
What did you...?
Could you say that
slower, please?

289
00:16:56,452 --> 00:17:01,309
"The tall hunk
with the rippling rump."

290
00:17:02,132 --> 00:17:05,500
And you automatically
thought of me.
Isn't that interesting?

291
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:07,502
Would you just get them
out of here, please?

292
00:17:07,537 --> 00:17:09,952
I will ripple them
into submission.

293
00:17:10,624 --> 00:17:13,158
Are you catching that?

294
00:17:17,664 --> 00:17:19,464
Said the monkey
to the...

295
00:17:20,234 --> 00:17:21,834
Hey, guys.
Hey.

296
00:17:21,952 --> 00:17:24,103
Hi, Cliff.
Hey, where's your monkey?

297
00:17:24,137 --> 00:17:27,789
Oh, no, it's
not my monkey.
I just rented him
to play a little,
uh, joke on Normie.

298
00:17:27,824 --> 00:17:29,333
Good one, huh, Zippy?

299
00:17:29,333 --> 00:17:32,490
Yeah, it gets funnier
every time
you mention it, Cliff.

300
00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:35,028
It was funny
when you sent me over
that crate of bananas,

301
00:17:35,028 --> 00:17:38,538
really funny when you
started having my mail
addressed to "Cheetah."

302
00:17:38,538 --> 00:17:41,504
Particularly hilarious when you
sent over the organ grinder.

303
00:17:41,538 --> 00:17:44,978
You know, Cliff, you just keep
getting funnier and funnier.

304
00:17:44,978 --> 00:17:48,076
You get any funnier,
I may have to kill you.

305
00:17:51,982 --> 00:17:53,816
That's it, call the cops.

306
00:17:53,850 --> 00:17:55,312
What are they doing?

307
00:17:55,312 --> 00:17:58,553
They're grabbing me,
teasing me,
making fun of me, and...

308
00:17:58,588 --> 00:18:00,849
stuffing money down my shorts.

309
00:18:00,849 --> 00:18:04,248
Hey, small bills, too.
That's great.

310
00:18:04,248 --> 00:18:07,029
Fresh meat!
Fresh meat!

311
00:18:07,063 --> 00:18:10,176
Send in
the young one!

312
00:18:18,742 --> 00:18:20,827
Say, is the, uh,
book club still meeting?

313
00:18:20,827 --> 00:18:23,679
- After a fashion.
- Oh, well, good.

314
00:18:23,713 --> 00:18:27,215
You know,
I dropped by the office
and dug up an old paper
I wrote when I was an undergrad.

315
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:30,285
I was always rather proud of it.
So I thought I might
share it with them.

316
00:18:30,319 --> 00:18:32,754
Frase, I don't think
you understand
what's going
on back there.

317
00:18:32,789 --> 00:18:36,408
Oh, Sam, you're hardly one
to condescend to me.

318
00:18:38,574 --> 00:18:40,830
Oh, ladies!

319
00:18:42,683 --> 00:18:46,474
Good God!
Please! I'm a doctor.

320
00:18:51,324 --> 00:18:53,626
Good night.
Bye-bye.

321
00:18:53,626 --> 00:18:57,139
Good night.
Good night.
- Thank you.

322
00:18:59,483 --> 00:19:04,350
20...
40. Yeah. Not bad.

323
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:06,763
Not bad
for a night's work.

324
00:19:08,024 --> 00:19:10,502
You got for...
I only got ten.

325
00:19:10,502 --> 00:19:14,471
Well, Sam, perhaps
you didn't, uh,
shake it until they
couldn't take it.

326
00:19:16,415 --> 00:19:18,789
Now, let me see.
Where are my keys?

327
00:19:18,789 --> 00:19:22,378
Oh, that's right.
I was using them
as castanets.

328
00:19:26,225 --> 00:19:28,228
What are you doing, Woody?

329
00:19:28,228 --> 00:19:31,260
I'm wringing my hands
with guilt.

330
00:19:31,264 --> 00:19:34,259
I don't think I've actually
seen that before.

331
00:19:34,259 --> 00:19:37,915
- Why?
- I told a terrible lie
to the guys, Sam.

332
00:19:37,915 --> 00:19:40,155
Oh, you mean about
being on that TV show?

333
00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:42,657
No, no, that
was true, but...

334
00:19:42,692 --> 00:19:46,712
I got a telephone call,
and I pretended it
was Robert Urich
on the other end.

335
00:19:46,712 --> 00:19:49,113
I mean, I-I didn't hurt
anybody or anything.

336
00:19:49,113 --> 00:19:52,643
Although your-your plumber
seemed a little confused.

337
00:19:53,303 --> 00:19:56,833
Don't worry about it.
I'm sure everyone
will forgive you.

338
00:19:56,833 --> 00:20:00,156
But it was a lie, Sam,
and I've never
told a lie before.

339
00:20:00,156 --> 00:20:04,010
What?
No, no, wait.
That's a lie.
I-I've told lies...

340
00:20:04,882 --> 00:20:08,153
See, now,
that's two lies.
See how much
easier it gets?

341
00:20:08,153 --> 00:20:11,062
Oh, my God, I'm
out of control.
What's next? Murder?

342
00:20:11,062 --> 00:20:13,388
No, no, hey,
Woody, Woody, Woody...

343
00:20:16,359 --> 00:20:19,478
Looks like the old
pool tournament
is out again
for next week.

344
00:20:19,478 --> 00:20:21,416
Yeah.
Oh, yeah?
Fancy that.

345
00:20:21,416 --> 00:20:24,915
Well, did you tell Norm?
When he hears that,
he'll go ape.

346
00:20:25,468 --> 00:20:30,541
Cliff, your delivery of jokes
is as bad as your
delivery of the mail.

347
00:20:30,456 --> 00:20:34,159
Mighty Joe Young
strikes back there.

348
00:20:34,193 --> 00:20:35,610
How'd you become
a mailman anyway?

349
00:20:35,645 --> 00:20:38,344
What, did you flunk
out of tollbooth school?

350
00:20:38,931 --> 00:20:41,670
Hey, all right, now,
that's a good one.

351
00:20:41,670 --> 00:20:43,629
Know why, uh, dogs hate mailmen?

352
00:20:43,629 --> 00:20:46,245
They just want to be
like everyone else.

353
00:20:46,873 --> 00:20:49,440
All right, that's it.
It's go time.

354
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,907
Okay, fellas, this is the guy
I've been telling you about.

355
00:20:51,907 --> 00:20:54,413
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait!
No, come on! Come on! Come on!

356
00:20:54,413 --> 00:20:55,797
Cli... Look at yourselves, here.

357
00:20:55,832 --> 00:20:58,166
Cliff! Cliff,
this is your friend, Norm.

358
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,401
Norm, this is your buddy, Cliff.

359
00:21:00,436 --> 00:21:03,568
You don't want
to do this.
Now, do you?

360
00:21:03,568 --> 00:21:05,957
All right, all right!
Hey, whoa!
Somebody help me here,
man, will you?

361
00:21:05,992 --> 00:21:08,412
Hey, stop! Hey, stop it, now.
Listen, I...

362
00:21:08,412 --> 00:21:11,769
You guys have been
friends for years.
Think of all the things
you've done together.

363
00:21:11,769 --> 00:21:14,411
You, you...
Drinking beer together.

364
00:21:14,411 --> 00:21:17,693
And I'm sure there's
a lot of other stuff, too.

365
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:20,126
Hey, you know,
you're partly at fault here.

366
00:21:20,126 --> 00:21:22,558
You made fun
of his profession,
and you refused
to pay him.

367
00:21:22,592 --> 00:21:24,137
And you, Norm...

368
00:21:24,137 --> 00:21:26,394
Actually, you didn't
do anything at
all, did you?

369
00:21:26,394 --> 00:21:26,778
I'll tell you what.

370
00:21:26,812 --> 00:21:29,829
Why don't you let me hold him,
and you biff him one?

371
00:21:30,305 --> 00:21:34,019
I don't know, Sammy.
I just want this
to be over with.

372
00:21:34,053 --> 00:21:36,317
Yeah, me, too.

373
00:21:36,506 --> 00:21:40,175
Well, I'm sorry, Norm.
Just... make out a bill,
and I'll pay it.

374
00:21:40,209 --> 00:21:41,426
I'll give you that discount.

375
00:21:41,461 --> 00:21:43,228
All right, uh, I...

376
00:21:43,263 --> 00:21:45,964
I guess that monkey stuff was
a little bit out of line, huh?

377
00:21:45,998 --> 00:21:47,816
It was actually pretty
funny, but...

378
00:21:47,851 --> 00:21:51,506
- It's a small man who can't laugh
at his own profession, you know?
- Yeah.

379
00:21:51,506 --> 00:21:53,905
I just want to let bygones
be bygones, all right?

380
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:56,442
And the important
thing is we're just...
still friends, hmm?

381
00:21:57,410 --> 00:22:01,466
- You mind, guys?
- Oh, oh, no, sorry, sorry.

382
00:22:06,452 --> 00:22:11,824
Yeah, Normie, I'm, uh,
I'm sort of sorry about
everything that happened.

383
00:22:11,858 --> 00:22:15,375
Oh, well, Cliff,
I'm even sorrier
for what's
about to happen.

384
00:22:15,375 --> 00:22:17,111
Huh? What do you mean?

385
00:22:41,121 --> 00:22:43,938
You're dead meat, Peterson!

386
00:22:47,577 --> 00:22:49,807
Let's go shoot
some stick.

387
00:22:53,834 --> 00:22:58,056
Hey, Woody.
Hey, Bob, how are you doing?

388
00:22:58,056 --> 00:23:00,891
Fine. Look, I was
just passing by,
and I wanted
to return your gloves.

389
00:23:00,891 --> 00:23:02,925
Thanks for letting
me use them.
Hey, my pleasure.

390
00:23:02,925 --> 00:23:06,875
- Listen, could you
hang on a second?
I got some friends
you'd love to meet.
- Yeah.

391
00:23:08,648 --> 00:23:11,950
Miss Howe?
You'll never
guess who's here.

392
00:23:11,984 --> 00:23:13,068
Bob Urich.

393
00:23:13,102 --> 00:23:16,488
Woody, it's been
a horrible night.
I'm really not in
the mood to be teased.

394
00:23:16,522 --> 00:23:18,386
No, no, it's the truth.
He's really here.

395
00:23:18,386 --> 00:23:20,329
Woody, go away!

396
00:23:22,094 --> 00:23:24,581
She's a big fan of yours.

397
00:23:25,365 --> 00:23:29,055
Hey, guys!
Bob Urich's here.

398
00:23:29,055 --> 00:23:32,674
Oh, sure, Wood.
Who's he with,
Liz Taylor?

399
00:23:32,872 --> 00:23:35,871
You're not, are you?
No.

400
00:23:35,871 --> 00:23:40,017
Look, uh, Woody, uh,
we were shooting late,
and I'm having
a few people over.
You want to come by?

401
00:23:40,017 --> 00:23:43,344
You bet.
Yeah, come on.
Great.

402
00:23:44,451 --> 00:23:46,251
The car's
right outside.

403
00:23:46,286 --> 00:23:48,690
- Could you hang on a second?
I want to check here.
- Sure.

404
00:23:48,690 --> 00:23:51,354
Hey, Sam, uh...
Robert Urich's here.

405
00:23:51,354 --> 00:23:53,670
Uh, he wants me to go
over to his house.
Can I leave?

406
00:23:53,670 --> 00:23:55,810
Woody, Woody, Wo...

407
00:23:55,845 --> 00:23:57,579
All right, yeah,
whatever you say.

408
00:23:57,614 --> 00:23:59,098
Great, we're out of here.

409
00:23:59,132 --> 00:24:00,571
Good night.

410
00:24:06,138 --> 00:24:08,039
No.

411
00:24:09,153 --> 00:24:29,040
translate
