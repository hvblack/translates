1
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:08,360
In other news, Tinseltown
is coming to Philadelphia.

2
00:00:08,393 --> 00:00:11,753
Hollywood stars Bryan Cranston
and Aaron Paul are here

3
00:00:11,753 --> 00:00:14,138
promoting their alcohol brand,
Dos Hombres.

4
00:00:14,138 --> 00:00:17,278
Hey, Bryan, how does it feel
to be the kingpin of mezcal?

5
00:00:17,311 --> 00:00:21,341
Oh, no, no. No, no.
Don't-don't put that on me.
No, I'm just a simple actor.

6
00:00:21,341 --> 00:00:25,674
This, this is the man,
the brains behind
the whole operation.
-No. No, no, no.

7
00:00:25,761 --> 00:00:27,140
It's a team effort.

8
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:30,269
Wow. Hollywood celebrities
right here in Philly, huh?

9
00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:34,077
-I don't love it. I mean,
why can't
they stay in their lane?
Why do they have
into come into our lane?

10
00:00:34,077 --> 00:00:35,849
The celebrity booze thing's
a little out of control.

11
00:00:35,849 --> 00:00:38,568
It's a total sellout.
I mean, a complete cash grab.

12
00:00:38,568 --> 00:00:43,549
Any idiot could take
a bottle of booze,
slap a celebrity's face on it
and-and make a fortune.

13
00:00:43,549 --> 00:00:45,843
-I mean, we could do it
if we wanted.
-Oh, we know more about booze
than these two guys, probably.

14
00:00:45,843 --> 00:00:49,773
-Are you kidding me?
Look, yeah,
is there an opportunity
for us to create a booze
of our own, right?

15
00:00:49,773 --> 00:00:51,790
And go pitch those guys?
Yeah, of course there is.

16
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:54,107
-It would be so easy.
-Yeah.
-It would be so easy, you know?

17
00:00:54,107 --> 00:00:56,396
And could we do
something like that?
-Also, yes.

18
00:00:56,396 --> 00:00:57,454
Absolutely.
-Of course, we could, you know.

19
00:00:57,454 --> 00:01:00,693
-But I mean,
are we gonna go do something
like that?
-Yes, we're gonna do that, yeah.

20
00:01:00,693 --> 00:01:02,268
-Of course we are, yes.
-I think we should.

21
00:01:02,301 --> 00:01:03,396
-I think we should.
-It's already happening.

22
00:01:03,396 --> 00:01:06,453
BOOZE

23
00:01:26,151 --> 00:01:29,426
Okay, guys, I think
we can all agree we need to
come up with a brand

24
00:01:29,426 --> 00:01:33,375
that is representative
of who we are as people
and as businessmen.

25
00:01:33,375 --> 00:01:37,351
Now I ask you guys this:
what's the first word
that comes to your mind

26
00:01:37,351 --> 00:01:40,047
when
you are trying to describe us?
-Premium.

27
00:01:40,047 --> 00:01:43,411
-Mm, I was gonna say that, dude.
-You were gonna say that, too?

28
00:01:43,411 --> 00:01:45,963
-And look, hey.
Listen, man, you're spot-on.
Premium.

29
00:01:45,963 --> 00:01:49,243
Yes, our brand will, of course,
be a premium brand.

30
00:01:49,243 --> 00:01:51,658
Now, what is the most premium
alcohol ever invented?

31
00:01:51,658 --> 00:01:54,579
-Goldschläger.
-Goldschläger. Yeah.
Goldschläger. All right, hey!

32
00:01:54,579 --> 00:01:57,486
We're all on the same page here.
This is good, I like this.
Okay, yeah.

33
00:01:57,486 --> 00:02:01,696
Swiss cinnamon schnapps liqueur
with drinkable flakes of gold
floating in it.

34
00:02:01,696 --> 00:02:03,698
My God, what's more premium
than that?

35
00:02:03,698 --> 00:02:05,611
-Yeah, nothing.
-Nothing, right?

36
00:02:05,611 --> 00:02:09,801
Here's a pitch. Okay,
I can get a bunch of nickels
and I could smash them up
and put them into a 'schläger.

37
00:02:09,801 --> 00:02:13,439
Right? We call it
Nickelschläger,
and we pitch it as, like,
the working man's spirit.

38
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:16,835
And, you know, nickels are,
they're easy to find
and, uh, just as shiny.

39
00:02:16,835 --> 00:02:20,058
Well, that sounds disgusting,
and, uh,
potentially dangerous as well.

40
00:02:20,058 --> 00:02:21,022
-Yeah, I'm-a try it, though.

41
00:02:21,022 --> 00:02:24,141
Listen, I think I've pinpointed
a small market trend
that we could corner

42
00:02:24,211 --> 00:02:26,911
but that could
also totally represent us.

43
00:02:26,911 --> 00:02:28,737
I'm talking about a blend.

44
00:02:28,737 --> 00:02:30,646
A blend?

45
00:02:30,646 --> 00:02:33,469
-Oh. Blends.
-Yes. Blends, blends.
-Blends!
-Yes.

46
00:02:33,469 --> 00:02:37,322
Blends are very popular
these days.
Wine blends, whiskey blends,
you know?

47
00:02:37,322 --> 00:02:41,484
So let me ask you this:
what is the second-classiest
drink in the world?

48
00:02:41,484 --> 00:02:42,439
-Jägermeister. Yes.
-Jägermeister. Yeah, yeah.
-Jägermeister.

49
00:02:42,439 --> 00:02:44,480
-Jägermeister, yeah.
Amazing, yes.

50
00:02:44,533 --> 00:02:47,859
It's the 'meisters and the,
and the 'schlägers
and the schnapps.

51
00:02:47,859 --> 00:02:49,901
I mean, those are the drinks
that make people feel high-end,

52
00:02:49,967 --> 00:02:53,478
you know, like they're on
a European ski adventure, right?
-Yeah, it's true.
-Yeah.

53
00:02:53,572 --> 00:02:56,293
Those drinks that make people
feel premium, you know?

54
00:02:56,293 --> 00:03:00,024
So I say we do a blend
of all the most premium drinks.

55
00:03:00,024 --> 00:03:02,337
We put them all together,
and we make one drink

56
00:03:02,337 --> 00:03:06,271
called Paddy's
SchlägerSchnappsterMeister.

57
00:03:06,673 --> 00:03:08,670
-That's brilliant.
-That's so smart.

58
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:12,039
-Well, because it-it blends them
-Dude, that is really smart.
It's fun.
-all together, like you said.
-Who's thought of that?

59
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:15,456
-It's a lot of fun, right?
- It definitely feels like you're
in Switzerland or something.

60
00:03:15,456 --> 00:03:17,772
-Yeah, yeah.
-Great, so you guys get it,
okay. Great.

61
00:03:17,806 --> 00:03:19,417
So I-I'm so glad we're on
the same page with this.

62
00:03:19,417 --> 00:03:23,509
So, here's the thing.
All we got to do
is get those celebrity guys'
blessing and boom--

63
00:03:23,509 --> 00:03:25,506
we are off to the races,
we're gonna be rich men,

64
00:03:25,582 --> 00:03:29,240
but I don't think
we should approach them
without being
fully funded first.

65
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:32,986
So our first test
is gonna be landing a big fish
who can finance
this whole operation.

66
00:03:32,986 --> 00:03:36,418
and I know just the guy.

67
00:03:41,187 --> 00:03:43,328
-Yo.
-Yo, Frank,

68
00:03:43,328 --> 00:03:45,777
I got you on speakerphone
with, uh, Mac and Charlie.

69
00:03:45,777 --> 00:03:47,728
-Where are you right now?
-I'm in the sky.

70
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:48,721
-In the sky?
-What?

71
00:03:48,721 --> 00:03:52,950
That's right, dicknips.
We're in the sky
on a private plane
on the way to Aruba.

72
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:54,779
- What the hell, Frank?
Why you taking Dee?

73
00:03:54,847 --> 00:03:58,624
-Um, because
I'm more glamorous
than you guys.
Frank recognizes that
and so he invited me.

74
00:03:58,624 --> 00:04:00,806
I was on my way to the jet,

75
00:04:00,806 --> 00:04:05,340
she overheard me talking
about the flight
and she glommed on.

76
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:08,460
-Yeah, you know what?
We don't care.
Uh, Frank, we have a business
proposition for you, pal.

77
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:12,386
Frank, how would you like
to invest
in a celebrity alcohol brand?

78
00:04:12,386 --> 00:04:14,814
No, I don't know about that.

79
00:04:14,892 --> 00:04:20,907
I-I once had Greg Louganis
as the face of my apricot brand
in the '80s.

80
00:04:20,907 --> 00:04:25,410
But when he cracked his noggin
at the Olympics,
the business took a nosedive
with him.

81
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:28,150
Okay, well, we're talking about
a much bigger celebrity
than that, okay?

82
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:29,996
We're talking about
a household name here.

83
00:04:29,996 --> 00:04:34,460
Have you ever hear
of a little show called
Malcolm in the Middle?

84
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:37,019
Have I?
Changed the game.

85
00:04:37,019 --> 00:04:39,689
-Changed the game, Frank.
-That it did. That it did.
- Yes. Yes.
-It did change the game.
-That it did.

86
00:04:39,689 --> 00:04:41,642
One of
the greatest shows of all time.

87
00:04:41,642 --> 00:04:45,269
Well, listen, the dad
from that show is in town
and we're gonna be
pitching him tonight.

88
00:04:45,269 --> 00:04:48,570
And Malcolm. He's here, too,
although he's all grown up now,
-so you might not recognize him.
-Yeah.

89
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:51,848
Dang, that sounds
pretty glamorous.
I'd like to hang with celebs.

90
00:04:51,848 --> 00:04:54,732
-Shut up, Dee.
- Shut up, Dee.
- Oh, God,
shut up, Dee.

91
00:04:54,732 --> 00:04:56,652
Shut your mouth
or I will shut it for you!

92
00:04:56,652 --> 00:04:59,050
When you get back,
Mac's gonna shut it for you!

93
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:01,183
We're gonna shut your mouth and
we're gonna sew your lips shut!

94
00:05:01,183 --> 00:05:03,203
- Just shut up.
-Shut up!
-Shut up!

95
00:05:03,203 --> 00:05:08,093
-All right, well-well,
you know, if you can get,
uh, Malcolm and his dad
on the hook,

96
00:05:08,167 --> 00:05:11,208
bring them to me at the jet.
When I land, we'll talk shop.

97
00:05:11,208 --> 00:05:13,887
-Oh, good.
- Nice, dude.
-Big fish landed!
-All right!

98
00:05:13,887 --> 00:05:15,875
How are they gonna
bring them to Aruba?

99
00:05:15,875 --> 00:05:19,846
We were never going to Aruba.
We're circling Philly.

100
00:05:19,846 --> 00:05:23,102
Oh, my God.
There's The Linc!

101
00:05:23,172 --> 00:05:25,396
What the hell, Frank?
Why are we circling Philly?

102
00:05:25,396 --> 00:05:30,662
I got to put enough miles
on the jet
to make it look like
I went to Aruba and back.

103
00:05:30,662 --> 00:05:31,835
It's a tax thing.

104
00:05:31,835 --> 00:05:35,400
Then why don't we just
go to Aruba and back?
Wouldn't that make more sense?

105
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,018
I have things to do in Philly.

106
00:05:37,018 --> 00:05:39,102
But I don't want
to circle Philly for hours.

107
00:05:39,102 --> 00:05:42,915
Hey, look, first you nag me
to get on the plane,
now you're nagging me
to get off.

108
00:05:42,915 --> 00:05:47,477
Just-- No dice.
We're circling Philly.
-Oh, goddamn it.

109
00:05:49,576 --> 00:05:52,572
It is popping off in there, man.
It is popping off.

110
00:05:52,572 --> 00:05:55,247
Actually, Charlie,
I would also love for you
to pop off that hat.

111
00:05:55,247 --> 00:05:58,755
-No, dude, you said dress nice.
I want to be able to tip
my cap to these guys
when I meet them.

112
00:05:58,755 --> 00:06:02,046
-Yeah, but you look like
a limo driver.
-Whatever, dude.
I look good, man.

113
00:06:02,046 --> 00:06:04,102
You guys want to hit
some of this, too, by the way?

114
00:06:04,102 --> 00:06:06,573
-The hell is that?
-It's Nickelschläger, man.

115
00:06:06,573 --> 00:06:08,279
It's delicious.
I've been drinking it all day.

116
00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:10,761
- Throw that shit out. Do not
bring that up in the pitch.
-I'm gonna pitch it.

117
00:06:10,761 --> 00:06:13,903
-Dude, do not-- Don't--
Oh, goddamn it.

118
00:06:15,895 --> 00:06:18,602
-Over here, sir.
-Okay, you know what?
That might have been this.

119
00:06:18,602 --> 00:06:21,299
Uh, here, I'll give it to you,
I guess. Uh, don't mind me.

120
00:06:21,299 --> 00:06:25,067
-Anything in your pockets, sir?
-No, no, I'm good.
I'm good, I sh--

121
00:06:29,045 --> 00:06:33,447
- Guys, why is it going off
on my stomach?
- Because you have
a belly full of nickels.

122
00:06:33,447 --> 00:06:37,378
Oh, right. Shit.
Okay, you know what? Um...
I'll make myself throw up
and then I'll get--

123
00:06:37,378 --> 00:06:39,176
Should I throw up here or, uh...

124
00:06:39,176 --> 00:06:42,539
All right, I'm gonna go outside
and-and I'll meet you guys
back in.

125
00:06:42,539 --> 00:06:45,399
-Great.
Good riddance.
He looks ridiculous anyway.

126
00:06:45,461 --> 00:06:49,142
Yeah, well, you don't look
that much better, pal.
I mean, what-what,
what is going on with that suit?

127
00:06:49,142 --> 00:06:52,461
Oh, I'm going for
a "Jordan in the '90s" look.

128
00:06:52,461 --> 00:06:55,010
I mean, who's more premium
than MJ, right?

129
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:57,664
Now, I'm thinking
that I go pitch a fashion line

130
00:06:57,664 --> 00:06:59,680
and sort of expand
into a lifestyle brand.

131
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,570
-No, don't do that.
Okay? Let's just-- Uh, can we
stick with the one thing?

132
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:04,235
Just stick with
the one thing, please.

133
00:07:04,235 --> 00:07:05,945
-They're celebrities.
They're gonna get the look.

134
00:07:05,945 --> 00:07:08,264
-I know they're celebrities.
I'm not saying they're not
celebrities. I'm saying--

135
00:07:08,264 --> 00:07:10,152
- Do you know
who Michael Jordan is?
-Yes, I know who--

136
00:07:10,152 --> 00:07:10,953
-Then why are you
-fighting me about this?

137
00:07:11,027 --> 00:07:14,504
-Can we just go get in
the meet-and-greet line?
It's already getting
long as shit. Come on.

138
00:07:19,432 --> 00:07:22,188
-Frank. Frank!
-What?

139
00:07:22,205 --> 00:07:23,410
How much longer?

140
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:26,047
-Three hours.
-Oh, my God.

141
00:07:26,047 --> 00:07:30,341
Can I watch
what you're watching?
'Cause the Wi-Fi
is not strong enough
for me to watch anything.

142
00:07:30,418 --> 00:07:32,426
You should have
downloaded movies, then.

143
00:07:32,426 --> 00:07:37,498
- I mean, I also have to go
to the bathroom.
- Well, that's not good.
Bathroom on the plane is busted.

144
00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:40,347
-W-What?
-Yeah, but you can use
the emergency can.

145
00:07:40,347 --> 00:07:43,142
- Where's the emergency can?
-You're sitting on it.

146
00:07:43,142 --> 00:07:46,674
You just pull that cushion up
and, uh, get that
privacy screen over there.

147
00:07:46,674 --> 00:07:50,463
- Is it a number one
or a number two?
- It's a number one.

148
00:07:50,463 --> 00:07:53,655
Eh, let 'er rip.
It's still gonna go out
in the air anyway.

149
00:07:53,655 --> 00:07:56,407
Are you sure you don't have
any food anywhere?

150
00:07:56,407 --> 00:07:57,998
Why don't you sniff around
back there?

151
00:07:57,998 --> 00:08:00,490
What's this?
There's a can of something.

152
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:02,634
Oh, that's an old can of oysters
from another flight.

153
00:08:02,634 --> 00:08:05,099
-A can of oysters?
-Yeah, go ahead, have them.

154
00:08:05,099 --> 00:08:07,050
Ugh, goddamn it.

155
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:10,106
All right, all right.
Getting pretty close here.

156
00:08:10,106 --> 00:08:12,873
-Okay, now,
just go with me here, Dennis.
I want you to picture it,
all right?

157
00:08:12,873 --> 00:08:16,969
It's a whole
lifestyle ecosystem.
-With booze and suits

158
00:08:16,969 --> 00:08:21,043
and apps that link you
to personal trainers
who make you look good
in the suits.

159
00:08:21,043 --> 00:08:22,488
Premium.
Dude, this is what I'm saying.

160
00:08:22,488 --> 00:08:25,083
-No, listen, can we please,
please, please just
stick with the blend?
Stick with the blend.

161
00:08:25,083 --> 00:08:28,818
-This is a blend of ideas.
- Yes, but it's a blend of
too many ideas.

162
00:08:28,818 --> 00:08:30,645
I don't even
know what you're talking about
half the time.

163
00:08:30,645 --> 00:08:33,074
-I'm talking about
branding, bro, it's branding.

164
00:08:33,074 --> 00:08:35,277
You know what, actually,
you just keep
your mouth shut the whole time.

165
00:08:35,277 --> 00:08:37,069
Just keep your
mouth shut, I'll do the talking.

166
00:08:37,069 --> 00:08:40,479
We do the firm handshake, right?
'Cause that's essential
to setting tone
for a good pitch.

167
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:42,442
Got to have a firm handshake.
And then that's it.

168
00:08:42,442 --> 00:08:46,405
I do the talking,
and don't say a goddamn thing
about booze and suits and apps.

169
00:08:46,405 --> 00:08:47,374
-Here we go.
-Oh, okay.

170
00:08:47,671 --> 00:08:49,882
-Thank you.
-Thanks, ladies.
-Thank you so much.

171
00:08:49,882 --> 00:08:51,761
-Uh, all right. Come on, guys.
- All right.

172
00:08:51,761 --> 00:08:55,750
-Hey, there, fellas.
- Hi, uh, hello to you, kind sirs.

173
00:08:55,819 --> 00:08:57,674
-Let's do a...

174
00:08:58,458 --> 00:09:02,488
No, I'm sorry,
we-we don't shake hands. So...

175
00:09:02,488 --> 00:09:04,842
Uh, well, that kind of
throws off my whole thing.

176
00:09:04,842 --> 00:09:06,945
I think-- We can't kick this off
without a firm handshake.

177
00:09:06,945 --> 00:09:08,479
-I really don't mind
shaking his hand.

178
00:09:08,479 --> 00:09:11,561
How many times do we have
to go through this?
We're not shaking hands.
-We're not shaking hands.

179
00:09:11,561 --> 00:09:14,011
-We don't know these people.
-Don't know you. Sorry.

180
00:09:14,011 --> 00:09:17,722
Wow, look at that suit. I love that.
-Yeah. Look at that.

181
00:09:17,722 --> 00:09:19,376
I'm not supposed to talk.

182
00:09:19,376 --> 00:09:21,231
I'm not supposed to, either.

183
00:09:21,231 --> 00:09:23,144
Oh-- Come on,
let's get this going.

184
00:09:23,144 --> 00:09:25,090
-He's-he's kidding.
He's kidding.
-Uh, yeah, so-so...
-He's kidding.
-Oh, yes. He, uh, just...

185
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:28,161
-Yeah, but--
-Come on, everybody say,
"Dos Hombres."

186
00:09:28,161 --> 00:09:30,013
-Oh, uh...
- Dos Hombres!

187
00:09:30,013 --> 00:09:32,846
-All right, you can get
the photos with the QR code
that way.

188
00:09:32,846 --> 00:09:36,434
-No, I don't need a photo.
Actually, I-I just
wanted to pitch you--

189
00:09:38,164 --> 00:09:41,118
- What just happened?
- You blew it, dude.
You choked.

190
00:09:41,118 --> 00:09:42,642
I didn't choke, no.
It was...

191
00:09:42,642 --> 00:09:44,977
Malcolm.
He was throwing me a weird vibe.

192
00:09:44,977 --> 00:09:49,232
Yeah. He's very aggressive.
He's, like, he's, like
the alpha dog, dude.
I didn't like that.

193
00:09:49,232 --> 00:09:51,536
-Malcolm's not in the middle.
He's on top.
-He's on top.

194
00:09:51,536 --> 00:09:54,641
-Shit.
-You know what, let's-let's
get back in the line.

195
00:10:04,427 --> 00:10:06,485
Hey, buddy.

196
00:10:07,183 --> 00:10:10,165
- Hey, can I ask you something
really quick?
-Yeah, sure, man. What's up?

197
00:10:10,165 --> 00:10:13,789
-Uh, hey, listen,
I've been throwing up
for a little bit.
- Ugh, dude, sorry.

198
00:10:13,789 --> 00:10:17,255
Yeah, I-I actually
kind of can't stop.
I think I'm having
a reaction to the metals.

199
00:10:17,255 --> 00:10:21,984
But, uh, my real problem
is, like,
no matter how much I hurl,
like, the nickels
keep coming out.

200
00:10:21,984 --> 00:10:25,029
-Nickels?
- Oh, yeah, it's a 'schläger play
I got going.

201
00:10:25,029 --> 00:10:28,683
So, hey, look,
can you do me a favor?
On my next hurl,
you know, do you--

202
00:10:28,757 --> 00:10:33,502
could you see if you see any
loose change in there, you know?
'Cause, like, I-I really got to
get a extra set of eyes on this.

203
00:10:33,502 --> 00:10:35,506
-I can't help you. All right?
I-I'm waiting for somebody.
-Please, please.
Sir, I'm begging you, please.

204
00:10:35,506 --> 00:10:38,328
-It's not happening.
Listen, man,
I can't help, all right?

205
00:10:38,328 --> 00:10:40,325
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry!

206
00:10:40,325 --> 00:10:43,205
What the hell?!
Damn it!

207
00:10:43,525 --> 00:10:47,054
Come here.
Come here. Look at this.
Look at this.
-Okay. Yes, sir.

208
00:10:47,054 --> 00:10:51,096
They're gonna ding me
for the cleaning fee.
-Peace and love, peace and love.

209
00:10:51,096 --> 00:10:54,062
Damn it!
Just say by my car.
Stay by my car
and watch this,

210
00:10:54,062 --> 00:10:55,466
I got to figure this out.
Get by the car.

211
00:10:55,466 --> 00:10:59,010
-Okay, okay, okay.
I got your car.
I'll watch your car.
Yeah.

212
00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:02,323
He was a big boy.

213
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:06,822
Hey, man, are you
the Dos Hombres driver?

214
00:11:06,822 --> 00:11:10,356
- Who?
- You know,
the Malcolm in the Middle guys.

215
00:11:10,356 --> 00:11:12,642
Yes, I am.

216
00:11:12,642 --> 00:11:14,374
Come on, come on.

217
00:11:14,374 --> 00:11:16,095
The dad did like my suit.

218
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:19,143
Would you shut up
about the dad and the suit?

219
00:11:19,143 --> 00:11:20,927
- What are they doing?

220
00:11:20,927 --> 00:11:23,126
Damn it.
They're wrapping things up.

221
00:11:23,126 --> 00:11:24,608
That's great. We blew it.

222
00:11:24,608 --> 00:11:27,155
We totally blew our one shot.
Goddamn it.

223
00:11:27,155 --> 00:11:29,064
Hey, I think
I just saw Jalen Hurts.

224
00:11:29,064 --> 00:11:30,760
-What? Seriously? Where?

225
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:33,457
Dude, he just went
into the bathroom.
I'm sure that was him.

226
00:11:33,457 --> 00:11:35,385
Okay, uh, listen.
We're gonna pivot, all right?

227
00:11:35,481 --> 00:11:38,873
I mean, Jalen's a better fit for
our Philly-based brand anyway,
don't you think?
-Yeah.

228
00:11:38,873 --> 00:11:40,454
-Let's go talk to Jalen.
-Let's get Jalen.

229
00:11:40,454 --> 00:11:41,973
Come on, let's go.

230
00:11:42,681 --> 00:11:43,957
-Jalen.

231
00:11:43,957 --> 00:11:48,359
so, hey, listen, uh,
I know this is a little weird,
us bum-rushing you in the
bathroom like this, but, uh...

232
00:11:48,359 --> 00:11:50,012
You always were good
against the rush.

233
00:11:50,012 --> 00:11:53,577
Now, that is true.
You are good against the ru--
Now, you're not gonna get away
from us, though.

234
00:11:53,577 --> 00:11:55,530
We gotcha.

235
00:11:55,530 --> 00:11:57,792
That was a joke. Um...

236
00:11:58,479 --> 00:12:02,765
Okay, uh, well, listen, uh,
we-we just, uh,
we wanted to pitch you

237
00:12:02,765 --> 00:12:05,124
a-a really great
business opportunity.

238
00:12:05,124 --> 00:12:09,455
Yes, now imagine this lifestyle:
you're on a Caribbean island
in an ill-fitting suit.

239
00:12:09,455 --> 00:12:13,732
No, no, st-- no, uh, Jalen,
we're not-not here to...
-pitch you a lifestyle.

240
00:12:15,747 --> 00:12:17,672
-Gritty?
-Wait...

241
00:12:17,672 --> 00:12:19,621
-What the hell is this?
-Wh-- I...

242
00:12:19,621 --> 00:12:22,650
I thought you said Jalen Hurts
came in here.
Is he in one
of the other stalls?

243
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:24,852
I don't know, I must have
gotten them confused.

244
00:12:24,852 --> 00:12:28,706
How do you confuse
a young Black man
with a giant orange monster?

245
00:12:28,706 --> 00:12:31,890
Okay, Gritty, picture yourself
on a Caribbean island.

246
00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:34,485
-Don't pitch Gritty! We're here
to talk to a celebrity.

247
00:12:34,485 --> 00:12:36,807
-Gritty's just Gritty.

248
00:12:36,807 --> 00:12:39,937
What-- Oh, hey, Jalen! Jalen!
There he is. Jalen!

249
00:12:39,937 --> 00:12:41,339
-Ah, we just missed him.

250
00:12:41,339 --> 00:12:44,334
-What are you talking about?
That was not Jalen Hurts.
- Yes, it was.

251
00:12:44,334 --> 00:12:46,757
- Oh, don't take his side, Gritty.
-Well, he's right.

252
00:12:46,757 --> 00:12:48,495
-That was definitely
Jalen Hurts.

253
00:12:48,495 --> 00:12:50,192
Uh, you know what, Gritty,
we don't need you anymore.

254
00:12:50,192 --> 00:12:52,889
Why don't you take a hike, pal?
Appreciate it.

255
00:12:53,566 --> 00:12:55,560
-Goddamn it.
Hold on a second.

256
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,215
Oh, it's Charlie.
What-- Wait, wait, wait.

257
00:12:57,215 --> 00:13:01,413
-What do you want, man?
- Hey, uh,
Dennis, uh, get to Frank
as fast as you can.

258
00:13:01,413 --> 00:13:03,268
I have Malcolm and his dad.

259
00:13:03,268 --> 00:13:06,666
-Are you serious?
-I'll explain later.
Just-- I'll delay them
as long as I can.

260
00:13:06,666 --> 00:13:09,505
Hey, could you maybe just
not be on the-the phone?

261
00:13:09,505 --> 00:13:11,540
-Yeah? Okay.
-Oh, yeah.
Of course, sir.
Yeah, I got to go.

262
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:13,444
-Please? Thank you.
-Uh, sorry about that.

263
00:13:13,444 --> 00:13:16,350
-Very unprofessional. Uh, apologies.
-Thank you very much. Yeah, that's okay.

264
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:19,938
- Does it smell funky in here?
- Very funky.

265
00:13:19,938 --> 00:13:23,745
-Oh, you guys
picking up an aroma?
-Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, all right.

266
00:13:23,745 --> 00:13:27,486
You-- There might be a funk
to it, Mr. Malcolm.
I did vomit in here earlier.

267
00:13:27,486 --> 00:13:30,449
Oh, oh, great.
Thank you for that.

268
00:13:30,449 --> 00:13:33,716
Wow. And my name is not
Mr. Malcolm, it's Aaron.

269
00:13:33,716 --> 00:13:38,472
Okay, I got you. Yeah, yeah.
We can go by whatever code name
you feel most
comfortable with, sir.

270
00:13:38,472 --> 00:13:41,276
You know, I can't imagine
the pressures of being
a Hollywood celebrity.

271
00:13:41,276 --> 00:13:43,660
-Oh, oh, please, please, please!
Watch the road, watch the road.
-Oh, yeah! Shit!

272
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:45,304
-Pardon my language.

273
00:13:45,304 --> 00:13:50,030
Yeah, sorry about that.
Uh, pardon my driving.
I haven't driven a car
in a long, long time.

274
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:52,419
I-- We really got to start
vetting these drivers.

275
00:13:52,419 --> 00:13:54,545
Okay? If we're driving around
in these crappy town cars

276
00:13:54,579 --> 00:13:56,475
with lunatics
and now we're flying coach?

277
00:13:56,475 --> 00:13:59,578
-Counterpoint. I do like the grit.
-Coach?

278
00:13:59,578 --> 00:14:03,070
-Oh, my God.
-Don't you?
I mean, it's associating
with the common man.

279
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:04,318
-Talking about me?
-Yes.

280
00:14:04,318 --> 00:14:05,927
-Oh, yeah, sure. Yeah, yeah.
-Yeah.

281
00:14:05,927 --> 00:14:09,567
-When I first stepped
onto the boards
in the Great White Way
of Broadway...

282
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:14,919
-Oh, and here we go again
about Broadway.
Was I in the role
of Richard III?

283
00:14:14,952 --> 00:14:16,512
-Were you? No?
-Slipping it in, of course.
-No.

284
00:14:16,512 --> 00:14:19,833
-I was his understudy.
I never really got
to be on stage.

285
00:14:19,833 --> 00:14:21,292
-Okay.
-But I was very close.

286
00:14:21,292 --> 00:14:25,263
-You had to earn it, huh?
You had to earn it.
-It's all about the work,
isn't it?

287
00:14:25,263 --> 00:14:28,333
-See? He's working,
we're working.
-Yeah, right?
Yeah, we're-- We are working.

288
00:14:28,333 --> 00:14:30,553
Now, you can never forget
where you came from.

289
00:14:30,553 --> 00:14:32,851
-Remember how you got here?
Remember, huh?
-Yes.

290
00:14:32,851 --> 00:14:38,206
This clown lost all of his money
playing slots
-at Pechanga. Yeah.
-It-- I-I--

291
00:14:38,206 --> 00:14:40,723
No, you have a problem.
You know you have a problem.

292
00:14:40,723 --> 00:14:42,942
The first step:
admitting you have a problem.

293
00:14:42,942 --> 00:14:47,594
I admit I am a servant
to the gods of chance.
I pray at their altar.

294
00:14:47,594 --> 00:14:48,871
-Yeah, way too much.
-Come on, baby.

295
00:14:48,871 --> 00:14:50,871
-Yeah, come on, baby!
-Way too much.

296
00:14:50,871 --> 00:14:55,852
Let 'er roll!
-No, this guy was a week away
from sucking off tourists, okay?

297
00:14:55,852 --> 00:14:58,696
-To pay his rent,
and you know that.

298
00:14:58,799 --> 00:15:00,697
Fellas, you're not gonna
have to suck anyone off.

299
00:15:00,697 --> 00:15:03,139
I'm taking you guys straight
to a private plane today.

300
00:15:03,139 --> 00:15:06,378
-Oh, great. Finally. See? See?
There you go. Aren't you happy?

301
00:15:06,378 --> 00:15:07,715
-I'm very happy. Yes.
-Doesn't that feel nice?

302
00:15:07,715 --> 00:15:09,308
Finally. Okay.

303
00:15:09,308 --> 00:15:12,074
Sorry, I happen to be getting
another-another call here.
I got to take it.

304
00:15:12,074 --> 00:15:13,367
Hello, this is the driver.

305
00:15:13,367 --> 00:15:16,185
Hey, Charlie!
You said to call when we landed.

306
00:15:16,185 --> 00:15:18,353
What? We landed?

307
00:15:18,353 --> 00:15:21,151
We landed 20 minutes ago.
I'm just gassing up.

308
00:15:21,151 --> 00:15:25,211
Oh, goddamn it,
why didn't you tell me that?
I wouldn't have eaten
the disgusting oysters.

309
00:15:25,211 --> 00:15:27,953
-You ate those oysters?
- What? You told me to.

310
00:15:27,953 --> 00:15:31,867
That can is from
a shellfish company I started
with Tony Danza
back in the '80s.

311
00:15:31,867 --> 00:15:34,522
Tony's Oysters in a Can-za?
-It was a catchy name.

312
00:15:34,522 --> 00:15:37,448
- Didn't go anywhere.
-Goddamn you.
Gross. I am out of here.

313
00:15:37,448 --> 00:15:39,476
- Frank?
-Charlie.

314
00:15:39,476 --> 00:15:42,751
-Uh, this is Mr. Frank.
He's the owner of the plane.
-Oh, perfect.

315
00:15:42,751 --> 00:15:45,357
Uh, yes, Mr. Frank?
I have the father and son.

316
00:15:45,357 --> 00:15:49,936
You got them, Charlie?
Bring them over right away.
All right. 

317
00:15:49,936 --> 00:15:52,679
Charlie got Malcolm and his dad.

318
00:15:52,679 --> 00:15:55,330
-Oh, shit. Are you serious?
Oh, I'm staying.

319
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:58,457
-What are you talking about?
You've been complaining about
getting off the plane.

320
00:15:58,457 --> 00:15:59,968
Now all of a sudden
you're staying?

321
00:15:59,968 --> 00:16:02,824
-All right. Hey, guys. Come on.
Let's go. Out of the cabin.

322
00:16:02,824 --> 00:16:04,444
What-what--
I'm not leaving my plane.

323
00:16:04,444 --> 00:16:08,833
Oh, no, we've had
this whole situation
where Jalen Hurts felt trapped
and he just freaked out
and ran away.

324
00:16:08,833 --> 00:16:11,118
-It was not Jalen Hurts, okay?
It was literally
just some Black guy.

325
00:16:11,118 --> 00:16:12,826
-I-- It was definitely
-Jalen Hurts. Either way,
-It was not Jalen Hurts.

326
00:16:12,826 --> 00:16:14,274
-let's just go. Let's go.
-Let's go. Come on.
-Up, up, up.

327
00:16:14,274 --> 00:16:16,960
-Ugh, all right, all right.

328
00:16:20,658 --> 00:16:23,627
-Yeah.

329
00:16:23,627 --> 00:16:28,305
Yeah, but I always wonder
at whose expense.

330
00:16:28,305 --> 00:16:32,391
You know,
when I was making my way
on the Great White Way
of Broadway...

331
00:16:32,462 --> 00:16:35,354
-Oh, my God. Jesus-- Hey.
You know, I-I have an idea.

332
00:16:35,354 --> 00:16:37,667
Why don't you just shut
your eyes and go to sleep?

333
00:16:37,667 --> 00:16:40,841
And then I will let you know
when you can wake up.

334
00:16:40,841 --> 00:16:43,593
-Okay? Shh.
-Okay. Thank you.

335
00:16:44,912 --> 00:16:48,659
-Oh, but sleep's for pussies.
Let's party, am I right?
Hey, guys, I'm Dee.

336
00:16:48,659 --> 00:16:53,541
- Jesus, where'd you come from?
- I didn't know we were
sharing the plane.

337
00:16:54,695 --> 00:16:58,440
Hi, I'm Frank, the owner.
And you don't
have to share the plane.

338
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:01,825
This plane, this
pretty little bird can be yours

339
00:17:01,825 --> 00:17:04,755
for a mere price of $35 mil.

340
00:17:04,755 --> 00:17:07,384
-Sorry, actually, um...
Hey, guys, don't worry.
-It's a beautiful bird.


341
00:17:07,384 --> 00:17:09,348
We're not-not here to sell you
a plane. Frank, please, don't.

342
00:17:09,348 --> 00:17:10,924
Yeah, we want to--
We-we'd sell the plane

343
00:17:10,924 --> 00:17:14,184
-We would, but that's
not the point.
-if you would go for it,
-you'd buy it.
-Just-- We're not selling
the plane.

344
00:17:14,184 --> 00:17:17,721
-Okay, we're here
to sell you, um--
-A lifestyle
and ill-fitting suits.

345
00:17:17,721 --> 00:17:20,595
-No, no, no, uh,
that-that's also wrong.
We're not selling
any of that, okay?

346
00:17:20,595 --> 00:17:23,549
-No, no, no. Let's-let's... No.
We're here to sell you a, uh--

347
00:17:23,549 --> 00:17:26,848
- Nickelschläger!
- No, goddamn it! None of that. None of that. 

348
00:17:26,848 --> 00:17:30,498
Okay,
listen-listen to me. Listen.
Look, we're just-- Listen.
Let's just start over, okay?
-He's the driver.

349
00:17:30,567 --> 00:17:34,615
We're gonna start all over,
and we're gonna do it
with a firm handshake.

350
00:17:35,111 --> 00:17:37,283
Oh. I'm not supposed to.

351
00:17:37,283 --> 00:17:40,513
-Oh, come on, man.
- I think you're in
an abusive relationship.

352
00:17:40,513 --> 00:17:44,788
Okay! This is absolutely insane.
Put your hand down, Bryan.

353
00:17:44,788 --> 00:17:46,841
But I don't mind shaking
his hand, really, I don't--

354
00:17:46,841 --> 00:17:49,866
No, put it down,
you silly little bitch.
Put it down.

355
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:51,704
-Put it down.
-No.

356
00:17:51,704 --> 00:17:55,350
- Don't you touch him.
- I said no.

357
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:58,487
What? Oh, my God.

358
00:17:58,487 --> 00:18:00,493
What is happening?

359
00:18:00,493 --> 00:18:04,892
Sit down.
Please, just sit down.

360
00:18:04,892 --> 00:18:07,805
-You want us to sit down?
-Sit down, please, all of you.

361
00:18:07,805 --> 00:18:10,304
-We-we will sit down.
- Yeah, why don't we all sit down?

362
00:18:10,304 --> 00:18:12,964
I don't ask for a lot.

363
00:18:12,964 --> 00:18:15,932
An Emmy here, a Tony there.

364
00:18:15,932 --> 00:18:19,326
Little pocket change for
the one-armed succubus in Reno.

365
00:18:19,326 --> 00:18:24,418
But you.
You, you're--
It's never enough for you.

366
00:18:24,418 --> 00:18:26,018
You want it all.

367
00:18:26,018 --> 00:18:31,235
And you deceived me
into thinking
that-that I wanted it all, too,
and I don't.

368
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:35,696
And you took charge
of our little operation,
and ever since then,

369
00:18:35,696 --> 00:18:40,421
you've been... you've been
controlling my life.

370
00:18:40,556 --> 00:18:44,979
You control everything.

371
00:18:46,964 --> 00:18:49,211
Or do you?

372
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:56,331
Maybe...
you are the one being deceived.

373
00:18:56,331 --> 00:19:01,430
Maybe being the front man
of an alcohol business

374
00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:05,402
places your head
so far out in front of you

375
00:19:05,402 --> 00:19:10,506
that you don't even realize
that your neck is exposed.

376
00:19:10,506 --> 00:19:15,229
Enough to be lopped off
by a public

377
00:19:15,229 --> 00:19:20,570
so thirsty to taste the blood
of greedy celebrities.

378
00:19:21,701 --> 00:19:26,505
So, when they come--
and they will--

379
00:19:26,505 --> 00:19:29,137
who are they gonna
come after, huh?

380
00:19:29,137 --> 00:19:32,463
The sweet, hapless boob...

381
00:19:32,463 --> 00:19:36,976
...or the slick-talking,
scheming millennial?

382
00:19:39,102 --> 00:19:42,981
So, I ask you...

383
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:45,791
...bitch...

384
00:19:47,185 --> 00:19:50,675
...who is really in charge here?

385
00:19:54,866 --> 00:19:56,824
Boom.

386
00:19:56,824 --> 00:20:01,638
And that, my friends,
is acting.

387
00:20:01,638 --> 00:20:05,258
-What? Wow!
-What?!
-Wait, wait.

388
00:20:05,258 --> 00:20:09,179
-That was--
-That-that was all fake?
- Made it all up.
Fake, fake, fake, fake.

389
00:20:09,179 --> 00:20:11,832
No offense, anything I said.
I was just joking.

390
00:20:11,832 --> 00:20:14,399
But I do love to perform.
I do, it's in my blood.

391
00:20:14,399 --> 00:20:17,449
-You got the stuff.
Uh, you should consider
doing a drama, Mr. Middle.

392
00:20:17,449 --> 00:20:19,279
-You really should
consider doing drama.
-Yeah.

393
00:20:19,279 --> 00:20:22,252
-I think you got the goods, man.
Hey, so listen,
do you guys want to invest?

394
00:20:22,252 --> 00:20:24,842
-Boss?
-Fuck no.

395
00:20:24,842 --> 00:20:27,154
-Fuck no! No.
-Fuck no!

396
00:20:27,154 --> 00:20:29,859
Of course not.
I don't want to spend
another moment with you crazies.

397
00:20:29,859 --> 00:20:31,459
-Not another minute.
-You people are insane.

398
00:20:31,459 --> 00:20:33,782
Get me off this plane.

399
00:20:33,783 --> 00:20:53,783
translate
