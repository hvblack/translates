1
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:08,360
In other news, Tinseltown
is coming to Philadelphia.

2
00:00:08,393 --> 00:00:11,753
Hollywood stars Bryan Cranston
and Aaron Paul are here

3
00:00:11,753 --> 00:00:14,138
promoting their alcohol brand,
Dos Hombres.

4
00:00:14,138 --> 00:00:17,278
Hey, Bryan, how does it feel
to be the kingpin of mezcal?

5
00:00:17,311 --> 00:00:21,341
Oh, no, no. No, no.
Don't-don't put that on me.
No, I'm just a simple actor.

6
00:00:21,341 --> 00:00:25,674
This, this is the man,
the brains behind
the whole operation.
-No. No, no, no.

7
00:00:25,761 --> 00:00:27,140
It's a team effort.

8
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:30,269
Wow. Hollywood celebrities
right here in Philly, huh?

9
00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:34,077
-I don't love it. I mean,
why can't
they stay in their lane?
Why do they have
into come into our lane?

10
00:00:34,077 --> 00:00:35,849
The celebrity booze thing's
a little out of control.

11
00:00:35,849 --> 00:00:38,568
It's a total sellout.
I mean, a complete cash grab.

12
00:00:38,568 --> 00:00:43,549
Any idiot could take
a bottle of booze,
slap a celebrity's face on it
and-and make a fortune.

13
00:00:43,549 --> 00:00:45,843
-I mean, we could do it
if we wanted.
-Oh, we know more about booze
than these two guys, probably.

14
00:00:45,843 --> 00:00:49,773
-Are you kidding me?
Look, yeah,
is there an opportunity
for us to create a booze
of our own, right?

15
00:00:49,773 --> 00:00:51,790
And go pitch those guys?
Yeah, of course there is.

16
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:54,107
-It would be so easy.
-Yeah.
-It would be so easy, you know?

17
00:00:54,107 --> 00:00:56,396
And could we do
something like that?
-Also, yes.

18
00:00:56,396 --> 00:00:57,454
Absolutely.
-Of course, we could, you know.

19
00:00:57,454 --> 00:01:00,693
-But I mean,
are we gonna go do something
like that?
-Yes, we're gonna do that, yeah.

20
00:01:00,693 --> 00:01:02,268
-Of course we are, yes.
-I think we should.

21
00:01:02,301 --> 00:01:03,396
-I think we should.
-It's already happening.

22
00:01:03,396 --> 00:01:06,453
BOOZE

23
00:01:26,151 --> 00:01:29,426
Okay, guys, I think
we can all agree we need to
come up with a brand

24
00:01:29,426 --> 00:01:33,375
that is representative
of who we are as people
and as businessmen.

25
00:01:33,375 --> 00:01:37,351
Now I ask you guys this:
what's the first word
that comes to your mind

26
00:01:37,351 --> 00:01:40,047
when
you are trying to describe us?
-Premium.

27
00:01:40,047 --> 00:01:43,411
-Mm, I was gonna say that, dude.
-You were gonna say that, too?

28
00:01:43,411 --> 00:01:45,963
-And look, hey.
Listen, man, you're spot-on.
Premium.

29
00:01:45,963 --> 00:01:49,243
Yes, our brand will, of course,
be a premium brand.

30
00:01:49,243 --> 00:01:51,658
Now, what is the most premium
alcohol ever invented?

31
00:01:51,658 --> 00:01:54,579
-Goldschläger.
-Goldschläger. Yeah.
Goldschläger. All right, hey!

32
00:01:54,579 --> 00:01:57,486
We're all on the same page here.
This is good, I like this.
Okay, yeah.

33
00:01:57,486 --> 00:02:01,696
Swiss cinnamon schnapps liqueur
with drinkable flakes of gold
floating in it.

34
00:02:01,696 --> 00:02:03,698
My God, what's more premium
than that?

35
00:02:03,698 --> 00:02:05,611
-Yeah, nothing.
-Nothing, right?

36
00:02:05,611 --> 00:02:09,801
Here's a pitch. Okay,
I can get a bunch of nickels
and I could smash them up
and put them into a 'schläger.

37
00:02:09,801 --> 00:02:13,439
Right? We call it
Nickelschläger,
and we pitch it as, like,
the working man's spirit.

38
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:16,835
And, you know, nickels are,
they're easy to find
and, uh, just as shiny.

39
00:02:16,835 --> 00:02:20,058
Well, that sounds disgusting,
and, uh,
potentially dangerous as well.

40
00:02:20,058 --> 00:02:21,022
-Yeah, I'm-a try it, though.

41
00:02:21,022 --> 00:02:24,141
Listen, I think I've pinpointed
a small market trend
that we could corner

42
00:02:24,211 --> 00:02:26,911
but that could
also totally represent us.

43
00:02:26,911 --> 00:02:28,737
I'm talking about a blend.

44
00:02:28,737 --> 00:02:30,646
A blend?

45
00:02:30,646 --> 00:02:33,469
-Oh. Blends.
-Yes. Blends, blends.
-Blends!
-Yes.

46
00:02:33,469 --> 00:02:37,322
Blends are very popular
these days.
Wine blends, whiskey blends,
you know?

47
00:02:37,322 --> 00:02:41,484
So let me ask you this:
what is the second-classiest
drink in the world?

48
00:02:41,484 --> 00:02:42,439
-Jägermeister. Yes.
-Jägermeister. Yeah, yeah.
-Jägermeister.

49
00:02:42,439 --> 00:02:44,480
-Jägermeister, yeah.
Amazing, yes.

50
00:02:44,533 --> 00:02:47,859
It's the 'meisters and the,
and the 'schlägers
and the schnapps.

51
00:02:47,859 --> 00:02:49,901
I mean, those are the drinks
that make people feel high-end,

52
00:02:49,967 --> 00:02:53,478
you know, like they're on
a European ski adventure, right?
-Yeah, it's true.
-Yeah.

53
00:02:53,572 --> 00:02:56,293
Those drinks that make people
feel premium, you know?

54
00:02:56,293 --> 00:03:00,024
So I say we do a blend
of all the most premium drinks.

55
00:03:00,024 --> 00:03:02,337
We put them all together,
and we make one drink

56
00:03:02,337 --> 00:03:06,271
called Paddy's
SchlägerSchnappsterMeister.

57
00:03:06,673 --> 00:03:08,670
-That's brilliant.
-That's so smart.

58
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:12,039
-Well, because it-it blends them
-Dude, that is really smart.
It's fun.
-all together, like you said.
-Who's thought of that?

59
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:15,456
-It's a lot of fun, right?
- It definitely feels like you're
in Switzerland or something.

60
00:03:15,456 --> 00:03:17,772
-Yeah, yeah.
-Great, so you guys get it,
okay. Great.

61
00:03:17,806 --> 00:03:19,417
So I-I'm so glad we're on
the same page with this.

62
00:03:19,417 --> 00:03:23,509
So, here's the thing.
All we got to do
is get those celebrity guys'
blessing and boom--

63
00:03:23,509 --> 00:03:25,506
we are off to the races,
we're gonna be rich men, 

64
00:03:25,582 --> 00:03:29,240
but I don't think
we should approach them
without being
fully funded first.

65
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:32,986
So our first test
is gonna be landing a big fish
who can finance
this whole operation.

66
00:03:32,986 --> 00:03:36,418
and I know just the guy.

67
00:03:41,187 --> 00:03:43,328
-Yo.
-Yo, Frank,

68
00:03:43,328 --> 00:03:45,777
I got you on speakerphone
with, uh, Mac and Charlie.

69
00:03:45,777 --> 00:03:47,728
-Where are you right now?
-I'm in the sky.

70
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:48,721
-In the sky?
-What?

71
00:03:48,721 --> 00:03:52,950
That's right, dicknips.
We're in the sky
on a private plane
on the way to Aruba.

72
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:54,779
- What the hell, Frank?
Why you taking Dee?

73
00:03:54,847 --> 00:03:58,624
-Um, because
I'm more glamorous
than you guys.
Frank recognizes that
and so he invited me.

74
00:03:58,624 --> 00:04:00,806
I was on my way to the jet,

75
00:04:00,806 --> 00:04:05,340
she overheard me talking
about the flight
and she glommed on.

76
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:08,460
-Yeah, you know what?
We don't care.
Uh, Frank, we have a business
proposition for you, pal.

77
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:12,386
Frank, how would you like
to invest
in a celebrity alcohol brand?

78
00:04:12,386 --> 00:04:14,814
No, I don't know about that.

79
00:04:14,892 --> 00:04:20,907
I-I once had Greg Louganis
as the face of my apricot brand
in the '80s.

80
00:04:20,907 --> 00:04:25,410
But when he cracked his noggin
at the Olympics,
the business took a nosedive
with him.

81
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:28,150
Okay, well, we're talking about
a much bigger celebrity
than that, okay?

82
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:29,996
We're talking about
a household name here.

83
00:04:29,996 --> 00:04:34,460
Have you ever hear
of a little show called
Malcolm in the Middle?

84
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:37,019
Have I?
Changed the game.

85
00:04:37,019 --> 00:04:39,689
-Changed the game, Frank.
-That it did. That it did.
- Yes. Yes.
-It did change the game.
-That it did. 

86
00:04:39,689 --> 00:04:41,642
One of
the greatest shows of all time.

87
00:04:41,642 --> 00:04:45,269
Well, listen, the dad
from that show is in town
and we're gonna be
pitching him tonight.

88
00:04:45,269 --> 00:04:48,570
And Malcolm. He's here, too,
although he's all grown up now,
-so you might not recognize him.
-Yeah.

89
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:51,848
Dang, that sounds
pretty glamorous.
I'd like to hang with celebs.

90
00:04:51,848 --> 00:04:54,732
-Shut up, Dee.
- Shut up, Dee.
- Oh, God,
shut up, Dee.

91
00:04:54,732 --> 00:04:56,652
Shut your mouth
or I will shut it for you!

92
00:04:56,652 --> 00:04:59,050
When you get back,
Mac's gonna shut it for you!

93
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:01,183
We're gonna shut your mouth and
we're gonna sew your lips shut!

94
00:05:01,183 --> 00:05:03,203
- Just shut up.
-Shut up!
-Shut up!

95
00:05:03,203 --> 00:05:08,093
-All right, well-well,
you know, if you can get,
uh, Malcolm and his dad
on the hook,

96
00:05:08,167 --> 00:05:11,208
bring them to me at the jet.
When I land, we'll talk shop.

97
00:05:11,208 --> 00:05:13,887
-Oh, good.
- Nice, dude.
-Big fish landed!
-All right!

98
00:05:13,887 --> 00:05:15,875
How are they gonna
bring them to Aruba?

99
00:05:15,875 --> 00:05:19,846
We were never going to Aruba.
We're circling Philly.

100
00:05:19,846 --> 00:05:23,102
Oh, my God.
There's The Linc!

101
00:05:23,172 --> 00:05:25,396
What the hell, Frank?
Why are we circling Philly?

102
00:05:25,396 --> 00:05:30,662
I got to put enough miles
on the jet
to make it look like
I went to Aruba and back.

103
00:05:30,662 --> 00:05:31,835
It's a tax thing.

104
00:05:31,835 --> 00:05:35,400
Then why don't we just
go to Aruba and back?
Wouldn't that make more sense?

105
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,018
I have things to do in Philly.

106
00:05:37,018 --> 00:05:39,102
But I don't want
to circle Philly for hours.

107
00:05:39,102 --> 00:05:42,915
Hey, look, first you nag me
to get on the plane,
now you're nagging me
to get off.

108
00:05:42,915 --> 00:05:47,477
Just-- No dice.
We're circling Philly.
-Oh, goddamn it.

109
00:05:49,576 --> 00:05:52,572
It is popping off in there, man.
It is popping off.

110
00:05:52,572 --> 00:05:55,247
Actually, Charlie,
I would also love for you
to pop off that hat.

111
00:05:55,247 --> 00:05:58,755
-No, dude, you said dress nice.
I want to be able to tip
my cap to these guys
when I meet them.

112
00:05:58,755 --> 00:06:02,046
-Yeah, but you look like
a limo driver.
-Whatever, dude.
I look good, man.

113
00:06:02,046 --> 00:06:04,102
You guys want to hit
some of this, too, by the way?

114
00:06:04,102 --> 00:06:06,573
-The hell is that?
-It's Nickelschläger, man.

115
00:06:06,573 --> 00:06:08,279
It's delicious.
I've been drinking it all day.

116
00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:10,761
- Throw that shit out. Do not
bring that up in the pitch.
-I'm gonna pitch it.

117
00:06:10,761 --> 00:06:13,903
-Dude, do not-- Don't--
Oh, goddamn it.

118
00:06:15,895 --> 00:06:18,602
-Over here, sir.
-Okay, you know what?
That might have been this.

119
00:06:18,602 --> 00:06:21,299
Uh, here, I'll give it to you,
I guess. Uh, don't mind me.

120
00:06:21,299 --> 00:06:25,067
-Anything in your pockets, sir?
-No, no, I'm good.
I'm good, I sh--

121
00:06:29,045 --> 00:06:33,447
- Guys, why is it going off
on my stomach?
- Because you have
a belly full of nickels.

122
00:06:33,447 --> 00:06:37,378
Oh, right. Shit.
Okay, you know what? Um...
I'll make myself throw up
and then I'll get--

123
00:06:37,378 --> 00:06:39,176
Should I throw up here or, uh...

124
00:06:39,176 --> 00:06:42,539
All right, I'm gonna go outside
and-and I'll meet you guys
back in.

125
00:06:42,539 --> 00:06:45,399
-Great.
Good riddance.
He looks ridiculous anyway.

126
00:06:45,461 --> 00:06:49,142
Yeah, well, you don't look
that much better, pal.
I mean, what-what,
what is going on with that suit?

127
00:06:49,142 --> 00:06:52,461
Oh, I'm going for
a "Jordan in the '90s" look.

128
00:06:52,461 --> 00:06:55,010
I mean, who's more premium
than MJ, right?

129
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:57,664
Now, I'm thinking
that I go pitch a fashion line

130
00:06:57,664 --> 00:06:59,680
and sort of expand
into a lifestyle brand.

131
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,570
-No, don't do that.
Okay? Let's just-- Uh, can we
stick with the one thing?

132
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:04,235
Just stick with
the one thing, please.

133
00:07:04,235 --> 00:07:05,945
-They're celebrities.
They're gonna get the look.

134
00:07:05,945 --> 00:07:08,264
-I know they're celebrities.
I'm not saying they're not
celebrities. I'm saying--

135
00:07:08,264 --> 00:07:10,152
- Do you know
who Michael Jordan is?
-Yes, I know who--

136
00:07:10,152 --> 00:07:10,953
-Then why are you
-fighting me about this?

137
00:07:11,027 --> 00:07:14,504
-Can we just go get in
the meet-and-greet line?
It's already getting
long as shit. Come on.

138
00:07:19,432 --> 00:07:22,188
-Frank. Frank!
-What?

139
00:07:22,205 --> 00:07:23,410
How much longer?

140
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:26,047
-Three hours.
-Oh, my God.

141
00:07:26,047 --> 00:07:30,341
Can I watch
what you're watching?
'Cause the Wi-Fi
is not strong enough
for me to watch anything.

142
00:07:30,418 --> 00:07:32,426
You should have
downloaded movies, then.

143
00:07:32,426 --> 00:07:37,498
- I mean, I also have to go
to the bathroom.
- Well, that's not good.
Bathroom on the plane is busted.

144
00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:40,347
-W-What?
-Yeah, but you can use
the emergency can.

145
00:07:40,347 --> 00:07:43,142
- Where's the emergency can?
-You're sitting on it.

146
00:07:43,142 --> 00:07:46,674
You just pull that cushion up
and, uh, get that
privacy screen over there.

147
00:07:46,674 --> 00:07:50,463
- Is it a number one
or a number two?
- It's a number one.

148
00:07:50,463 --> 00:07:53,655
Eh, let 'er rip.
It's still gonna go out
in the air anyway.

149
00:07:53,655 --> 00:07:56,407
Are you sure you don't have
any food anywhere?

150
00:07:56,407 --> 00:07:57,998
Why don't you sniff around
back there?

151
00:07:57,998 --> 00:08:00,490
What's this?
There's a can of something.

152
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:02,634
Oh, that's an old can of oysters
from another flight.

153
00:08:02,634 --> 00:08:05,099
-A can of oysters?
-Yeah, go ahead, have them.

154
00:08:05,099 --> 00:08:07,050
Ugh, goddamn it.

155
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:10,106
All right, all right.
Getting pretty close here.

156
00:08:10,106 --> 00:08:12,873
-Okay, now,
just go with me here, Dennis.
I want you to picture it,
all right?

157
00:08:12,873 --> 00:08:16,969
It's a whole
lifestyle ecosystem.
-With booze and suits

158
00:08:16,969 --> 00:08:21,043
and apps that link you
to personal trainers
who make you look good
in the suits. 

159
00:08:21,043 --> 00:08:22,488
Premium.
Dude, this is what I'm saying.

160
00:08:22,488 --> 00:08:25,083
-No, listen, can we please,
please, please just
stick with the blend?
Stick with the blend.

161
00:08:25,083 --> 00:08:28,818
-This is a blend of ideas.
- Yes, but it's a blend of
too many ideas. 

162
00:08:28,818 --> 00:08:30,645
I don't even
know what you're talking about
half the time.

163
00:08:30,645 --> 00:08:32,969
-I'm talking about
branding, bro, it's branding.
-I know what you're--

164
00:08:33,002 --> 00:08:34,071
You know what, actually,
you just keep

165
00:08:34,104 --> 00:08:35,674
your mouth shut the whole time.

166
00:08:35,708 --> 00:08:37,244
Just keep your
mouth shut, I'll do the talking.

167
00:08:37,277 --> 00:08:39,014
We do the firm handshake, right?
'Cause that's essential

168
00:08:39,048 --> 00:08:40,751
to setting tone
for a good pitch.

169
00:08:40,785 --> 00:08:42,588
Got to have a firm handshake.
And then that's it.

170
00:08:42,622 --> 00:08:44,659
I do the talking,
and don't say a goddamn thing

171
00:08:44,693 --> 00:08:46,195
about booze and suits and apps.

172
00:08:46,228 --> 00:08:48,099
-Here we go.
-Oh, okay.

173
00:08:48,132 --> 00:08:49,836
-Thank you.
-Thanks, ladies.
-Thank you so much.

174
00:08:49,869 --> 00:08:51,840
-Uh, all right. Come on, guys.
- All right.

175
00:08:51,873 --> 00:08:53,076
-Okay, here we go.
-Hey, there, fellas.
-Hey.

176
00:08:53,109 --> 00:08:54,879
Hi, uh, hello to you, kind sirs.

177
00:08:54,913 --> 00:08:56,883
-Let's do a...

178
00:08:56,917 --> 00:08:59,154
-Oh, uh...
-No.

179
00:08:59,188 --> 00:09:02,260
No, I'm sorry,
we-we don't shake hands. So...

180
00:09:02,294 --> 00:09:04,599
Uh, well, that kind of
throws off my whole thing.

181
00:09:04,632 --> 00:09:06,570
I think-- We can't kick this off
without a firm handshake.

182
00:09:06,603 --> 00:09:08,172
-Why don't you just--
-I really don't mind
shaking his hand.

183
00:09:08,206 --> 00:09:09,876
How many times do we have
to go through this?

184
00:09:09,909 --> 00:09:12,047
-We're not shaking hands.
-We're not shaking hands.

185
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,049
-We don't know these people.
-Don't know you.

186
00:09:13,082 --> 00:09:14,719
-Sorry.
-Oh.

187
00:09:14,753 --> 00:09:15,988
Wow, look at that suit.

188
00:09:16,021 --> 00:09:17,290
-Yeah. Look at that.
-I love that.

189
00:09:17,324 --> 00:09:19,562
I'm not supposed to talk.

190
00:09:19,596 --> 00:09:21,031
- I didn't say--
I didn't say--
-I'm not supposed to, either.

191
00:09:21,065 --> 00:09:23,002
Oh-- Come on,
let's get this going.

192
00:09:23,035 --> 00:09:24,271
-He's-he's kidding.
He's kidding.
-Uh, yeah, so-so...

193
00:09:24,304 --> 00:09:26,108
-He's kidding.
-Oh, yes. He, uh, just...

194
00:09:26,142 --> 00:09:28,112
-Yeah, but--
-Come on, everybody say,
"Dos Hombres."

195
00:09:28,146 --> 00:09:30,116
-Oh, uh...
- Dos Hombres!

196
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:31,586
-All right, you can get
-Thanks so much.
-Yeah, so, we have a--

197
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:32,922
the photos with the QR code
that way.

198
00:09:32,955 --> 00:09:34,291
-There you go.
-No, I don't need a photo.

199
00:09:34,324 --> 00:09:35,761
Actually, I-I just
wanted to pitch you--

200
00:09:35,795 --> 00:09:38,600
-I--
-All right, hey. All right.

201
00:09:38,634 --> 00:09:39,869
What just happened?

202
00:09:39,903 --> 00:09:41,172
You blew it, dude.
You choked.

203
00:09:41,205 --> 00:09:43,342
I didn't choke, no.
It was... Malcolm.

204
00:09:43,376 --> 00:09:45,146
He was throwing me a weird vibe.

205
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:46,950
-Yeah. He's very aggressive.
-He's super aggressive.

206
00:09:46,983 --> 00:09:48,921
He's, like, he's, like
the alpha dog, dude.

207
00:09:48,954 --> 00:09:50,156
-I didn't like that.
-Malcolm's not in the middle.

208
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:52,060
-He's on top.
-He's on top.

209
00:09:52,094 --> 00:09:53,864
-Shit.
-You know what, let's-let's
get back in the line.

210
00:10:01,045 --> 00:10:03,182
Oh. Hey.

211
00:10:03,216 --> 00:10:04,351
Hey.

212
00:10:04,384 --> 00:10:06,723
Hey, buddy.

213
00:10:07,925 --> 00:10:09,294
Hey, can I ask you something
really quick?

214
00:10:09,328 --> 00:10:11,232
-Yeah, sure, man. What's up?
-Uh, hey, listen,

215
00:10:11,265 --> 00:10:12,802
I've been throwing up
for a little bit.

216
00:10:12,835 --> 00:10:14,171
Ugh, dude, sorry.

217
00:10:14,204 --> 00:10:15,708
Yeah, I-I actually
kind of can't stop.

218
00:10:15,741 --> 00:10:17,344
I think I'm having
a reaction to the metals.

219
00:10:17,377 --> 00:10:18,947
But, uh, my real problem
is, like,

220
00:10:18,981 --> 00:10:20,951
no matter how much I hurl,
like, the nickels

221
00:10:20,985 --> 00:10:23,189
-keep coming out.
-Nickels?

222
00:10:23,222 --> 00:10:25,160
Oh, yeah, it's a 'schläger play
I got going.

223
00:10:25,193 --> 00:10:26,797
So, hey, look,
can you do me a favor?

224
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:28,634
On my next hurl,
you know, do you--

225
00:10:28,667 --> 00:10:30,671
could you see if you see any
loose change in there, you know?

226
00:10:30,704 --> 00:10:33,342
'Cause, like, I-I really got to
get a extra set of eyes on this.

227
00:10:33,376 --> 00:10:35,246
-I can't help you. All right?
I-I'm waiting for somebody.
-Please, please.

228
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,683
-Sir, I'm begging you, please.
-It's not happening.

229
00:10:36,716 --> 00:10:39,054
Listen, man,
I can't help, all right?

230
00:10:39,087 --> 00:10:40,223
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry!

231
00:10:40,256 --> 00:10:41,392
What the hell?!

232
00:10:41,425 --> 00:10:43,196
-Damn it!
-Oh! Hey.

233
00:10:43,229 --> 00:10:44,666
-Hey, man, hey, hey.
-Come here.

234
00:10:44,699 --> 00:10:45,868
Come here. Look at this.
Look at this.

235
00:10:45,901 --> 00:10:47,337
-Okay. Yes, sir.
-Look at this.

236
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:48,740
They're gonna ding me
for the cleaning fee.

237
00:10:48,774 --> 00:10:49,843
-All right?
-Ah, yeah, look at that.

238
00:10:49,876 --> 00:10:51,011
Peace and love, peace and love.

239
00:10:51,045 --> 00:10:52,815
-Damn it!
-I'm sorry! Hey, hey.

240
00:10:52,849 --> 00:10:54,384
-Just say by my car.
Stay by my car
-Hey, hey.

241
00:10:54,418 --> 00:10:55,754
-Hey, hey!
-and watch this,
I got to figure this out.

242
00:10:55,788 --> 00:10:57,090
-Get by the car.
-Okay, okay, okay.

243
00:10:57,123 --> 00:10:57,825
I got your car.
I'll watch your car.

244
00:10:57,859 --> 00:10:58,961
Yeah.

245
00:10:58,994 --> 00:11:00,998
He was a big boy.

246
00:11:01,031 --> 00:11:02,835
-Jesus.
-Damn it.

247
00:11:04,271 --> 00:11:06,375
Hey, man, are you
the Dos Hombres driver?

248
00:11:06,408 --> 00:11:08,079
Who?

249
00:11:08,112 --> 00:11:09,682
You know,
the Malcolm in the Middle guys.

250
00:11:11,252 --> 00:11:12,387
Yes, I am.

251
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:13,924
Come on, come on.

252
00:11:15,159 --> 00:11:16,730
The dad did like my suit.

253
00:11:16,763 --> 00:11:19,001
Would you shut up
about the dad and the suit?

254
00:11:19,034 --> 00:11:20,403
-Thank you very much.
- What are they doing?

255
00:11:20,436 --> 00:11:21,873
-Oh, great. Okay.
-Damn it.

256
00:11:21,907 --> 00:11:23,009
They're wrapping things up.

257
00:11:23,042 --> 00:11:24,779
That's great. We blew it.

258
00:11:24,812 --> 00:11:27,183
We totally blew our one shot.
Goddamn it.

259
00:11:27,217 --> 00:11:29,321
Hey, I think
I just saw Jalen Hurts.

260
00:11:29,354 --> 00:11:30,925
-What? Seriously? Where?
-Yeah.

261
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:32,160
Dude, he just went
into the bathroom.

262
00:11:32,194 --> 00:11:33,830
I'm sure that was him.

263
00:11:33,864 --> 00:11:35,701
Okay, uh, listen.
We're gonna pivot, all right?

264
00:11:35,734 --> 00:11:37,137
I mean, Jalen's a better fit for
our Philly-based brand anyway,

265
00:11:37,170 --> 00:11:39,174
-don't you think?
-Yeah.

266
00:11:39,208 --> 00:11:40,443
-Let's go talk to Jalen.
-Let's get Jalen.

267
00:11:40,476 --> 00:11:42,147
Come on, let's go.

268
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:44,284
-Jalen.
-Yeah,

269
00:11:44,318 --> 00:11:46,055
so, hey, listen, uh,
I know this is a little weird,

270
00:11:46,088 --> 00:11:48,292
us bum-rushing you in the
bathroom like this, but, uh...

271
00:11:48,326 --> 00:11:50,263
You always were good
against the rush.

272
00:11:50,296 --> 00:11:52,033
Now, that is true.
You are good against the ru--

273
00:11:52,067 --> 00:11:54,071
Now, you're not gonna get away
from us, though.

274
00:11:54,104 --> 00:11:55,908
We gotcha.

275
00:11:55,941 --> 00:11:57,177
That was a joke. Um...

276
00:11:59,047 --> 00:12:01,485
Okay, uh, well, listen, uh,
we-we just, uh,

277
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:02,955
we wanted to pitch you

278
00:12:02,989 --> 00:12:05,193
a-a really great
business opportunity.

279
00:12:05,226 --> 00:12:06,997
Yes, now imagine this lifestyle:

280
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:09,067
you're on a Caribbean island
in an ill-fitting suit.

281
00:12:09,101 --> 00:12:11,907
No, no, st-- no, uh, Jalen,
we're not-not here to...

282
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,142
-pitch you a lifestyle.

283
00:12:16,081 --> 00:12:18,352
-Gritty?
-Wait...

284
00:12:18,386 --> 00:12:20,023
-What the hell is this?
-Wh-- I...

285
00:12:20,056 --> 00:12:21,325
I thought you said Jalen Hurts
came in here.

286
00:12:21,358 --> 00:12:22,929
Is he in one
of the other stalls?

287
00:12:22,962 --> 00:12:25,033
I don't know, I must have
gotten them confused.

288
00:12:25,066 --> 00:12:26,201
How do you confuse
a young Black man

289
00:12:26,235 --> 00:12:27,805
with a giant orange monster?

290
00:12:29,408 --> 00:12:32,047
Okay, Gritty, picture yourself
on a Caribbean island.

291
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:34,384
-Don't pitch Gritty! We're here
to talk to a celebrity.
-[toilet flushes]

292
00:12:34,418 --> 00:12:37,090
-Gritty's just Gritty.

293
00:12:37,123 --> 00:12:40,163
What-- Oh, hey, Jalen! Jalen!
There he is. Jalen!

294
00:12:40,196 --> 00:12:42,334
-Ah, we just missed him.
-What are you talking about?

295
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:44,338
-That was not Jalen Hurts.
-Yes, it was.

296
00:12:44,371 --> 00:12:46,208
Oh, don't take his side, Gritty.

297
00:12:46,241 --> 00:12:48,479
-Well, he's right.
-That was definitely
Jalen Hurts.

298
00:12:48,513 --> 00:12:49,949
Uh, you know what, Gritty,
we don't need you anymore.

299
00:12:49,983 --> 00:12:51,352
Why don't you take a hike, pal?

300
00:12:51,385 --> 00:12:52,989
-Appreciate it.

301
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:54,525
-Goddamn it.

302
00:12:54,559 --> 00:12:56,061
Hold on a second.
Oh, it's Charlie.

303
00:12:56,095 --> 00:12:57,498
What-- Wait, wait, wait.

304
00:12:57,531 --> 00:12:59,234
-What do you want, man?
-[Charlie] Hey, uh,

305
00:12:59,267 --> 00:13:01,372
Dennis, uh, get to Frank
as fast as you can.

306
00:13:01,405 --> 00:13:03,376
I have Malcolm and his dad.

307
00:13:03,409 --> 00:13:05,146
-Are you serious?
-I'll explain later.

308
00:13:05,179 --> 00:13:06,816
Just-- I'll delay them
as long as I can.

309
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:07,985
Hey, could you maybe just

310
00:13:08,019 --> 00:13:09,121
not be on the-the phone?

311
00:13:09,154 --> 00:13:10,390
-Yeah? Okay.
-Oh, yeah.

312
00:13:10,423 --> 00:13:11,960
Of course, sir.
Yeah, I got to go.

313
00:13:11,993 --> 00:13:13,396
-Please? Thank you.
-Uh, sorry about that.

314
00:13:13,429 --> 00:13:14,932
-Very unprofessional.
-Thank you very much.

315
00:13:14,966 --> 00:13:16,101
-Uh, apologies.
-Yeah, that's okay.

316
00:13:17,404 --> 00:13:18,874
Does it smell funky in here?

317
00:13:18,907 --> 00:13:20,376
Very funky.

318
00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:22,548
-Oh, you guys
picking up an aroma?
-Yeah.

319
00:13:22,581 --> 00:13:24,251
-Yeah.
-Yeah, yeah, all right.

320
00:13:24,284 --> 00:13:25,521
You-- There might be a funk
to it, Mr. Malcolm.

321
00:13:25,554 --> 00:13:27,558
I did vomit in here earlier.

322
00:13:27,591 --> 00:13:30,430
Oh, oh, great.
Thank you for that.

323
00:13:30,463 --> 00:13:34,004
Wow. And my name is not
Mr. Malcolm, it's Aaron.

324
00:13:34,037 --> 00:13:35,874
Okay, I got you. Yeah, yeah.

325
00:13:35,908 --> 00:13:37,177
We can go by whatever code name

326
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:38,847
you feel most
comfortable with, sir.

327
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,416
You know, I can't imagine
the pressures of being

328
00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:42,320
-a Hollywood celebrity.
-Oh, oh, please, please, please!

329
00:13:42,354 --> 00:13:43,523
-Watch the road, watch the road.
-Oh, yeah! Shit!

330
00:13:43,557 --> 00:13:45,861
-Jesus.
-Pardon my language.

331
00:13:45,894 --> 00:13:47,832
Yeah, sorry about that.
Uh, pardon my driving.

332
00:13:47,865 --> 00:13:49,869
I haven't driven a car
in a long, long time.

333
00:13:49,902 --> 00:13:52,307
I-- We really got to start
vetting these drivers.

334
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:54,545
Okay? If we're driving around
in these crappy town cars

335
00:13:54,579 --> 00:13:56,516
with lunatics
and now we're flying coach?

336
00:13:56,549 --> 00:13:57,585
-Counterpoint.
-Coach?

337
00:13:57,618 --> 00:13:59,589
I do like the grit.

338
00:13:59,622 --> 00:14:01,258
-Oh, my God.
-Don't you?

339
00:14:01,291 --> 00:14:03,162
I mean, it's associating
with the common man.

340
00:14:03,195 --> 00:14:04,464
-Talking about me?
-Yes.

341
00:14:04,499 --> 00:14:06,335
-Oh, yeah, sure. Yeah, yeah.
-Yeah.

342
00:14:06,368 --> 00:14:08,039
-Absolutely.
-When I first stepped
onto the boards

343
00:14:08,072 --> 00:14:10,009
in the Great White Way
of Broadway...

344
00:14:10,043 --> 00:14:13,182
-Oh, and here we go again
about Broadway.
-Was I in the role

345
00:14:13,215 --> 00:14:14,919
-of Richard III? No.
-Were you? No?

346
00:14:14,952 --> 00:14:16,321
-Slipping it in, of course.
-No.

347
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:18,025
-I was his understudy.
-Okay.

348
00:14:18,059 --> 00:14:19,595
-I never really got
to be on stage.

349
00:14:19,629 --> 00:14:21,198
-Okay.
-But I was very close.

350
00:14:21,231 --> 00:14:23,035
-You had to earn it, huh?

351
00:14:23,069 --> 00:14:25,440
-You had to earn it.
-It's all about the work,
isn't it?

352
00:14:25,473 --> 00:14:26,576
-See? He's working,
we're working.
-Yeah, right?

353
00:14:26,609 --> 00:14:28,179
Yeah, we're-- We are working.

354
00:14:28,212 --> 00:14:30,617
Now, you can never forget
where you came from.

355
00:14:30,651 --> 00:14:33,022
-Remember how you got here?
Remember, huh?
-Yes.

356
00:14:33,055 --> 00:14:36,061
This clown lost all of his money
playing slots

357
00:14:36,095 --> 00:14:38,600
-at Pechanga. Yeah.
-It-- I-I--

358
00:14:38,633 --> 00:14:40,637
No, you have a problem.
You know you have a problem.

359
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:42,942
The first step:
admitting you have a problem.

360
00:14:42,975 --> 00:14:46,115
I admit I am a servant
to the gods of chance.

361
00:14:46,148 --> 00:14:47,450
I pray at their altar.

362
00:14:47,484 --> 00:14:48,954
-Yeah, way too much.
-Come on, baby.

363
00:14:48,987 --> 00:14:49,989
-Way too much.
-Yeah, come on, baby!

364
00:14:50,022 --> 00:14:52,026
Let 'er roll!

365
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:53,897
-Let 'er rip!
-No, this guy was a week away

366
00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:56,101
from sucking off tourists, okay?

367
00:14:56,135 --> 00:14:58,907
-Oh, my God.
-To pay his rent,
and you know that.

368
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:00,476
Fellas, you're not gonna
have to suck anyone off.

369
00:15:00,511 --> 00:15:02,948
I'm taking you guys straight
to a private plane today.

370
00:15:02,982 --> 00:15:04,484
-Hmm?
-Oh, great. Finally. See? See?

371
00:15:04,519 --> 00:15:06,523
There you go. Aren't you happy?

372
00:15:06,556 --> 00:15:08,058
-Doesn't that feel nice?
-I'm very happy. Yes.

373
00:15:08,092 --> 00:15:09,662
Finally. Okay.

374
00:15:09,695 --> 00:15:11,966
Sorry, I happen to be getting
another-another call here.

375
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,402
-I got to take it.
Hello, this is the driver.
-Oh, my...

376
00:15:13,436 --> 00:15:16,241
Hey, Charlie!
You said to call when we landed.

377
00:15:16,275 --> 00:15:18,245
What? We landed?

378
00:15:18,279 --> 00:15:21,218
We landed 20 minutes ago.
I'm just gassing up.

379
00:15:21,251 --> 00:15:23,155
Oh, goddamn it,
why didn't you tell me that?

380
00:15:23,189 --> 00:15:25,226
I wouldn't have eaten
the disgusting oysters.

381
00:15:25,259 --> 00:15:26,529
-Ugh.
-You ate those oysters?

382
00:15:26,563 --> 00:15:28,132
What? You told me to.

383
00:15:28,165 --> 00:15:30,336
That can is from
a shellfish company I started

384
00:15:30,369 --> 00:15:31,973
with Tony Danza
back in the '80s.

385
00:15:32,006 --> 00:15:34,111
Tony's Oysters in a Can-za?

386
00:15:34,144 --> 00:15:36,081
-It was a catchy name.
Didn't go anywhere.
-Goddamn you.

387
00:15:36,115 --> 00:15:37,651
Gross. I am out of here.

388
00:15:37,685 --> 00:15:39,221
Frank?

389
00:15:39,254 --> 00:15:40,289
-Charlie.
-Uh, this is Mr. Frank.

390
00:15:40,323 --> 00:15:41,526
He's the owner of the plane.

391
00:15:41,559 --> 00:15:43,295
-Oh, perfect.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

392
00:15:43,329 --> 00:15:45,501
Uh, yes, Mr. Frank?
I have the father and son.

393
00:15:45,534 --> 00:15:48,540
You got them, Charlie?
Bring them over right away.

394
00:15:48,573 --> 00:15:50,276
All right. Ha, ha!

395
00:15:50,309 --> 00:15:52,715
Charlie got Malcolm and his dad.

396
00:15:52,748 --> 00:15:54,384
-Oh, shit. Are you serious?

397
00:15:54,417 --> 00:15:56,421
-Oh, I'm staying.
-What are you talking about?

398
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:58,392
You've been complaining about
getting off the plane.

399
00:15:58,425 --> 00:16:00,096
Now all of a sudden
you're staying?

400
00:16:00,129 --> 00:16:01,699
-All right. Hey, guys. Come on.

401
00:16:01,733 --> 00:16:03,169
Let's go. Out of the cabin.

402
00:16:03,202 --> 00:16:04,572
What-what--
I'm not leaving my plane.

403
00:16:04,605 --> 00:16:06,408
Oh, no, we've had
this whole situation

404
00:16:06,441 --> 00:16:08,245
where Jalen Hurts felt trapped
and he just freaked out

405
00:16:08,279 --> 00:16:10,283
-and ran away.
-It was not Jalen Hurts, okay?

406
00:16:10,316 --> 00:16:11,686
-It was literally
just some Black guy.
-I-- It was definitely

407
00:16:11,719 --> 00:16:13,289
-Jalen Hurts. Either way,
-It was not Jalen Hurts.

408
00:16:13,322 --> 00:16:14,659
-let's just go. Let's go.
-Let's go. Come on.

409
00:16:14,692 --> 00:16:15,293
-Up, up, up.
-Ugh, all right, all right.

410
00:16:24,211 --> 00:16:25,614
-Yeah.

411
00:16:25,647 --> 00:16:28,152
Yeah, but I always wonder
at whose expense.

412
00:16:28,185 --> 00:16:30,423
You know,
when I was making my way

413
00:16:30,456 --> 00:16:32,360
on the Great White Way
of Broadway...

414
00:16:32,393 --> 00:16:34,231
-Oh, my God. Jesus-- Hey.
-It was hard.

415
00:16:34,264 --> 00:16:35,767
You know, I-I have an idea.

416
00:16:35,801 --> 00:16:37,671
Why don't you just shut
your eyes and go to sleep?

417
00:16:37,705 --> 00:16:41,011
And then I will let you know
when you can wake up.

418
00:16:41,044 --> 00:16:43,015
-Okay? Shh.
-Okay. Thank you.

419
00:16:43,048 --> 00:16:44,685
Okay.

420
00:16:44,719 --> 00:16:46,556
-Oh, but sleep's for pussies.
-Geez.

421
00:16:46,589 --> 00:16:49,027
Let's party, am I right?
Hey, guys, I'm Dee.

422
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:50,797
Jesus, where'd you come from?

423
00:16:50,831 --> 00:16:52,735
I didn't know we were
sharing the plane.

424
00:16:52,768 --> 00:16:54,772
-Yeah, I-

425
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:56,676
Hi, I'm Frank, the owner.

426
00:16:56,709 --> 00:16:58,547
And you don't
have to share the plane.

427
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:02,120
This plane, this
pretty little bird can be yours

428
00:17:02,153 --> 00:17:04,792
for a mere price of $35 mil.

429
00:17:04,825 --> 00:17:06,395
Sorry, actually, um...

430
00:17:06,428 --> 00:17:08,299
-It's a beautiful bird.
-Hey, guys, don't worry.

431
00:17:08,332 --> 00:17:09,669
We're not-not here to sell you
a plane. Frank, please, don't.

432
00:17:09,702 --> 00:17:11,639
Yeah, we want to--
We-we'd sell the plane

433
00:17:11,673 --> 00:17:13,442
-We would, but that's
not the point.
-if you would go for it,

434
00:17:13,475 --> 00:17:15,146
-you'd buy it.
-Just-- We're not selling
the plane.

435
00:17:15,179 --> 00:17:16,315
-Okay, we're here
to sell you, um--
-A lifestyle

436
00:17:16,348 --> 00:17:18,052
-No, no.
-and ill-fitting suits.

437
00:17:18,085 --> 00:17:19,589
-No, no, no, uh,
that-that's also wrong.

438
00:17:19,622 --> 00:17:21,124
-We're not selling
any of that, okay?
-Okay.

439
00:17:21,158 --> 00:17:22,393
-No, no, no. Let's-let's... No.

440
00:17:22,427 --> 00:17:23,563
We're here to sell you a, uh--

441
00:17:23,597 --> 00:17:25,166
Nickelschläger!

442
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:26,669
No, goddamn it! None of that.

443
00:17:26,703 --> 00:17:28,272
None of that. Okay,
listen-listen to me. Listen.

444
00:17:28,305 --> 00:17:29,307
-Look, we're just-- Listen.
-He's the driver.

445
00:17:29,341 --> 00:17:30,844
Let's just start over, okay?

446
00:17:30,877 --> 00:17:32,748
We're gonna start all over,
and we're gonna do it

447
00:17:32,781 --> 00:17:34,619
with a firm handshake.

448
00:17:35,621 --> 00:17:37,558
Oh. I'm not supposed to.

449
00:17:37,591 --> 00:17:39,060
-Oh, come on, man.
- I think you're in

450
00:17:39,094 --> 00:17:40,429
an abusive relationship.

451
00:17:40,463 --> 00:17:43,335
Okay! This is absolutely insane.

452
00:17:43,369 --> 00:17:44,839
Put your hand down, Bryan.

453
00:17:44,872 --> 00:17:47,176
But I don't mind shaking
his hand, really, I don't--

454
00:17:47,210 --> 00:17:48,580
No, put it down,
you silly little bitch.

455
00:17:48,613 --> 00:17:49,749
Put it down.

456
00:17:49,782 --> 00:17:52,153
-Put it down.
-No.

457
00:17:52,186 --> 00:17:53,523
Don't you touch him.

458
00:17:53,556 --> 00:17:55,661
I said no.

459
00:17:55,694 --> 00:17:58,265
What? Oh, my God.

460
00:17:58,299 --> 00:17:59,835
What is happening?

461
00:18:01,238 --> 00:18:02,541
Sit down.

462
00:18:02,574 --> 00:18:04,477
Please, just sit down.

463
00:18:05,346 --> 00:18:07,250
-Y
ou want us to sit down?
-Sit down, please,

464
00:18:07,283 --> 00:18:09,287
-all of you.
-We-we will sit down.

465
00:18:09,321 --> 00:18:10,590
Yeah, why don't we all sit down?

466
00:18:10,624 --> 00:18:13,763
I don't ask for a lot.

467
00:18:13,797 --> 00:18:16,368
An Emmy here, a Tony there.

468
00:18:16,401 --> 00:18:19,341
Little pocket change for
the one-armed succubus in Reno.

469
00:18:19,374 --> 00:18:20,544
But you.

470
00:18:21,913 --> 00:18:24,585
You, you're--
It's never enough for you.

471
00:18:24,619 --> 00:18:26,388
You want it all.

472
00:18:26,421 --> 00:18:28,459
And you deceived me
into thinking

473
00:18:28,493 --> 00:18:30,897
that-that I wanted it all, too,
and I don't.

474
00:18:30,931 --> 00:18:34,237
And you took charge
of our little operation,

475
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:36,174
and ever since then,

476
00:18:36,208 --> 00:18:40,116
you've been... you've been
controlling my life.

477
00:18:42,521 --> 00:18:45,126
You control everything.

478
00:18:47,564 --> 00:18:48,733
Or do you?

479
00:18:51,539 --> 00:18:53,576
Maybe...

480
00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:56,315
you are the one being deceived.

481
00:18:56,348 --> 00:18:59,622
Maybe being the front man

482
00:18:59,655 --> 00:19:02,260
of an alcohol business

483
00:19:02,293 --> 00:19:05,567
places your head
so far out in front of you

484
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:08,372
that you don't even realize

485
00:19:08,405 --> 00:19:10,877
that your neck is exposed.

486
00:19:10,911 --> 00:19:13,950
Enough to be lopped off

487
00:19:13,983 --> 00:19:15,721
by a public

488
00:19:15,754 --> 00:19:17,958
so thirsty to taste the blood

489
00:19:17,992 --> 00:19:20,497
of greedy celebrities.

490
00:19:22,501 --> 00:19:24,672
So, when they come--

491
00:19:24,705 --> 00:19:27,176
and they will--

492
00:19:27,210 --> 00:19:29,515
who are they gonna
come after, huh?

493
00:19:29,548 --> 00:19:32,420
The sweet, hapless boob...

494
00:19:33,656 --> 00:19:36,529
...or the slick-talking,
scheming millennial?

495
00:19:39,902 --> 00:19:42,674
So, I ask you...

496
00:19:43,643 --> 00:19:45,547
...bitch...

497
00:19:47,985 --> 00:19:50,489
...who is really in charge here?

498
00:19:55,366 --> 00:19:56,903
Boom.

499
00:19:56,936 --> 00:19:59,875
And that, my friends,

500
00:19:59,909 --> 00:20:01,478
is acting.

501
00:20:01,512 --> 00:20:03,449
-What? Wow!

502
00:20:03,482 --> 00:20:05,754
-What?!
-Wait, wait.

503
00:20:05,787 --> 00:20:07,490
-That was--
-That-that was all fake?

504
00:20:07,524 --> 00:20:09,327
Made it all up.
Fake, fake, fake, fake.

505
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:10,797
No offense, anything I said.

506
00:20:10,831 --> 00:20:11,833
-Oh, no, you're welcome...
-I was just joking.

507
00:20:11,866 --> 00:20:13,402
But I do love to perform.

508
00:20:13,435 --> 00:20:15,372
-I do, it's in my blood.
-You got the stuff.

509
00:20:15,406 --> 00:20:17,711
Uh, you should consider
doing a drama, Mr. Middle.

510
00:20:17,745 --> 00:20:19,414
-You really should
consider doing drama.
-Yeah.

511
00:20:19,447 --> 00:20:20,851
-That's a good idea.
-I think you got the goods, man.

512
00:20:20,884 --> 00:20:21,886
Hey, so listen,
do you guys want to invest?

513
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:24,759
-Boss?
-Fuck no.

514
00:20:24,792 --> 00:20:27,463
-Fuck no! No.
-Fuck no!

515
00:20:27,498 --> 00:20:28,666
Of course not.
I don't want to spend

516
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:30,302
another moment with you crazies.

517
00:20:30,336 --> 00:20:31,572
-Not another minute.
-You people are insane.

518
00:20:31,606 --> 00:20:33,643
Get me off this plane.
