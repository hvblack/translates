1
00:00:12,313 --> 00:00:14,689
<i>Coming up next week on
The Golden Bachelor...</i>

2
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:18,319
<i>I'm really excited to
get back to Philly for my hometown visit.</i>

3
00:00:18,819 --> 00:00:22,238
<i>I run a bar with my kids
and my kids' friends.</i>

4
00:00:22,239 --> 00:00:25,325
<i>And my roommate,
who is also one of my kids' friends,</i>

5
00:00:25,326 --> 00:00:27,994
<i>who we thought was my kid.</i>

6
00:00:27,995 --> 00:00:32,623
<i>But we chucked his real dad off a cliff.
He was already soup by that point.</i>

7
00:00:32,624 --> 00:00:37,712
<i>Anyway... ...I want us all to have
a nice dinner, get to know each other.</i>

8
00:00:37,713 --> 00:00:41,090
<i>It's gonna be a really classy affair.</i>

9
00:00:43,302 --> 00:00:44,427
<i>We look forward to it.</i>

10
00:00:44,428 --> 00:00:48,515
<i>So join us next week as we travel to
Philadelphia for Frank's hometown visit.</i>

11
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:52,311
Well...
...you know what this means, guys.

12
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:55,647
- What?
- We gotta get our shit together.

13
00:00:57,214 --> 00:01:00,104
PRIME TIME

14
00:01:20,214 --> 00:01:22,131
- All right.
- I don't know. I don't get it.

15
00:01:22,132 --> 00:01:23,383
Like, why is he doing this?

16
00:01:23,384 --> 00:01:25,051
Oh, who knows? You know, fame, attention.

17
00:01:25,052 --> 00:01:27,470
Maybe he just wants to bang a bunch
of old ladies. It doesn't matter

18
00:01:27,471 --> 00:01:30,640
'cause what does matter is how we come
across when those cameras are rolling,

19
00:01:30,641 --> 00:01:32,892
{\an8}right? I mean, this is prime time TV
we're talking about.

20
00:01:32,893 --> 00:01:35,645
{\an8}And we pop on something like this,
all our hopes and dreams could come true.

21
00:01:35,646 --> 00:01:38,856
{\an8}I mean, hell... ...we live
in a country where reality television

22
00:01:38,857 --> 00:01:40,858
{\an8}could be a pathway
towards being the president.

23
00:01:40,859 --> 00:01:42,485
Yeah. But what's with the scripts?

24
00:01:42,486 --> 00:01:45,988
Oh. Yeah, so Frank said that
he wanted to have a really classy dinner.

25
00:01:45,989 --> 00:01:49,742
And, you know, we've struggled with that
a little bit in the past, admittedly.

26
00:01:49,743 --> 00:01:51,536
So I just jotted down some lines...

27
00:01:51,537 --> 00:01:54,455
...some small talk for us to,
you know, talk about over the dinner,

28
00:01:54,456 --> 00:01:57,208
so that we can stay away
from some of the danger zones.

29
00:01:57,209 --> 00:01:59,752
I feel like this is gonna feel
too scripted, you know?

30
00:01:59,753 --> 00:02:01,003
- Yeah, I mean...
- Well, it is.

31
00:02:01,004 --> 00:02:03,522
Shouldn't it be a little bit more
off the cuff?

32
00:02:03,522 --> 00:02:06,259
Like the other day I was walking down
by City Hall,

33
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:08,177
and I noticed this coyote
was following me.

34
00:02:08,178 --> 00:02:09,637
- Really?
- Right down Market Street,

35
00:02:09,638 --> 00:02:11,013
- in broad daylight.
- In Market Street?

36
00:02:11,014 --> 00:02:12,849
So I turned to this coyote.
I got on my haunches,

37
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:14,308
'cause you gotta get down
on your haunches.

38
00:02:14,309 --> 00:02:17,186
You gotta meet them where they are.
And I'm like, "Why are you following me?"

39
00:02:17,187 --> 00:02:18,729
- Yeah!
- I said, "Back off,

40
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:22,316
or I will stick my thumbs into your eyes."
Which I've said to you before.

41
00:02:22,317 --> 00:02:28,239
No, I don't think we should be regaling
audiences with tales of animal abuse.

42
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:31,242
- It was following him.
- We're not.
- I was the hunted, he was the hunter.
- Okay. Well--

43
00:02:31,243 --> 00:02:34,045
Dennis. Dennis.
How come I don't have any lines?

44
00:02:34,329 --> 00:02:35,788
You do.

45
00:02:35,789 --> 00:02:38,834
"Hi, I'm Dee. Frank is a great dad."
That's it.

46
00:02:40,377 --> 00:02:43,254
- It's all you need.
- No. It's not-- It doesn't pop.

47
00:02:43,255 --> 00:02:45,423
How am I supposed to pop with this?
No, I need to be slinging zingers.

48
00:02:45,424 --> 00:02:48,176
You guys, I have a new one about
a Chinese guy and his optometrist--

49
00:02:48,177 --> 00:02:51,637
Oh, God. No. Dee, stop doing that.
No race jokes, no edge.

50
00:02:51,638 --> 00:02:53,806
- You know, actually, no comedy at all.
- What?

51
00:02:53,807 --> 00:02:56,058
Well, we've moved past comedy
as a society.

52
00:02:56,059 --> 00:02:57,894
We don't want it anymore, we've decided.

53
00:02:57,895 --> 00:03:01,481
You know, it makes us think too much
about, you know, our current condition.

54
00:03:01,482 --> 00:03:03,524
And then, really, we don't want to think
about ourselves

55
00:03:03,525 --> 00:03:05,443
because it makes us feel bad
about ourselves.

56
00:03:05,444 --> 00:03:07,278
- It's confusing.
- So we project onto the people

57
00:03:07,279 --> 00:03:09,363
that are making us think,
and we cancel 'em.

58
00:03:09,364 --> 00:03:11,115
- We get mad.
- I'm with Dennis.

59
00:03:11,116 --> 00:03:13,409
- Go woke, go broke. Right, Dennis?
- Yeah, for sure, man.

60
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:15,953
No. Uh, well, no.
That's the opposite of what I'm saying.

61
00:03:15,954 --> 00:03:18,289
- It sounds like what you're saying.
- That's pretty much what you're saying.

62
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:19,666
It's not. No. She said--

63
00:03:21,335 --> 00:03:22,502
- We're already broke.
- Yeah.

64
00:03:22,503 --> 00:03:24,546
No, what I'm saying is if we go woke...

65
00:03:25,631 --> 00:03:27,174
- We'll go broke?
- ...we pop.

66
00:03:27,674 --> 00:03:31,052
I want to know what all these,
uh, creams and bottles are.

67
00:03:31,053 --> 00:03:34,597
- These-- What are we doing?
- Ah. Yes. Um, glad you asked, Charlie.

68
00:03:34,598 --> 00:03:37,141
Um, those are various shampoos
and tanning creams.

69
00:03:37,142 --> 00:03:41,562
And, uh, yeah, got some Nair hair removal
in there, for any unsightly hairs.

70
00:03:41,563 --> 00:03:42,648
What, me?

71
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:45,107
- Probably.
- Well, sure. Yeah, you.

72
00:03:45,108 --> 00:03:46,317
Uh, but, you know, all of you.

73
00:03:46,318 --> 00:03:47,735
- Here's an idea, actually.
- No, not me.

74
00:03:47,736 --> 00:03:50,863
What if instead of getting all clean,
I get more dirty.

75
00:03:50,864 --> 00:03:53,199
And then Frank's like,
"Oh, my God, he's dirty.

76
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,077
- I'm concerned about him," you know?
- You guys just aren't getting it, okay?

77
00:03:56,078 --> 00:04:00,290
You're not getting it. All right, this
is bigger than just looking good, okay?

78
00:04:00,791 --> 00:04:03,459
The most important thing here
is to not look bad.

79
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:06,504
Hollywood actually
has a system for this already in place.

80
00:04:06,505 --> 00:04:09,382
It's called the testing process.
They get together. Focus group,

81
00:04:09,383 --> 00:04:12,343
<i>and they... Well, actually, we did a focus
group for the last Thunder Gun movie,</i>

82
00:04:12,344 --> 00:04:13,886
- if you guys recall.
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

83
00:04:13,887 --> 00:04:16,013
And they score us on a scale
of one to one hundred.

84
00:04:16,014 --> 00:04:18,933
Then we just keep refining the dinner
over and over again,

85
00:04:18,934 --> 00:04:22,562
until finally we land
on the most perfect versions of ourselves

86
00:04:22,563 --> 00:04:26,858
that will appeal to the widest possible
audience and offend no one.

87
00:04:27,442 --> 00:04:31,696
That is how you make great art.

88
00:04:32,995 --> 00:04:34,324
REH1

89
00:04:34,324 --> 00:04:36,285
Okay. Thank you all for coming.

90
00:04:36,785 --> 00:04:39,662
Uh, so some of you have done these before,
for movies.

91
00:04:39,663 --> 00:04:42,331
And for some of you,
I know it's your first time.

92
00:04:42,332 --> 00:04:47,712
But, in a bit of an unorthodox move, we
will be watching a live performance today,

93
00:04:47,713 --> 00:04:50,464
<i>in preparation for the show
The Golden Bachelor.</i>

94
00:04:51,883 --> 00:04:56,830
Okay, so let's begin the, uh...
The show.

95
00:05:01,184 --> 00:05:02,894
- Tell 'em not to clap.
- Excuse me?

96
00:05:03,562 --> 00:05:06,439
Well, it's, you know, it's not
a play. So, they shouldn't clap or,

97
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:08,482
you know, laugh out loud or groan
or anything like that.

98
00:05:08,483 --> 00:05:11,737
No. How are we supposed to know
what they think is funny? Let 'em laugh.

99
00:05:12,863 --> 00:05:14,614
Okay. They can laugh,
but, you know, no claps.

100
00:05:14,615 --> 00:05:16,907
I think we should keep the claps
so we know what they love.

101
00:05:16,908 --> 00:05:19,869
Oh, God. Jesus Christ.
Dude, you really overdid it on the tanner.

102
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:21,662
- Well, it's a farmer's tan.
- You're not a farmer.

103
00:05:21,663 --> 00:05:22,747
But my guy is.

104
00:05:22,748 --> 00:05:24,165
Your guy? What guy?

105
00:05:24,166 --> 00:05:25,542
You know what? Just start.

106
00:05:27,294 --> 00:05:30,572
Right. Uh... So, let's begin.

107
00:05:40,891 --> 00:05:41,892
Okay.

108
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:49,678
Well, here we are.

109
00:05:50,233 --> 00:05:51,692
Sure can't wait to see Frank.

110
00:05:51,693 --> 00:05:53,361
I can't wait to meet the lucky lady.

111
00:05:53,362 --> 00:05:55,388
If Frank likes her, I'll like her.

112
00:05:56,323 --> 00:05:57,658
So, where are they?

113
00:05:58,158 --> 00:06:01,369
Well, our lovable old pal Charlie
is on his way over with them right now.

114
00:06:02,454 --> 00:06:04,915
- Oh. Speak of the devil.
- Huh.

115
00:06:05,415 --> 00:06:07,459
Here they are.
Come on in, guys. It's open.

116
00:06:11,296 --> 00:06:13,173
Hello, everybody.

117
00:06:13,674 --> 00:06:17,177
Frank, Frank's date, come on in.

118
00:06:19,137 --> 00:06:21,305
Thanks, Charlie. I'm starving.

119
00:06:21,306 --> 00:06:25,476
Um, me too. Because I'm a slut
who likes to shove things in her mouth.

120
00:06:26,853 --> 00:06:27,938
Right.

121
00:06:32,401 --> 00:06:34,385
What a day.

122
00:06:34,486 --> 00:06:37,239
You guys will not believe
what happened to me.

123
00:06:38,365 --> 00:06:40,282
Okay. Well, I'm sure
it's a very interesting story.

124
00:06:40,283 --> 00:06:42,618
But we don't want to hear it,
because we're here to talk to Frank.

125
00:06:42,619 --> 00:06:44,745
I wanna hear Charlie's story
because he looks crazy.

126
00:06:44,746 --> 00:06:46,872
No, no, no, no.
You don't want to hear his story,

127
00:06:46,873 --> 00:06:48,374
because you were gonna tell us
more about yourself.

128
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:50,709
- What happened to you?
- You were gonna tell us more...

129
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:52,288
- You were gonna tell us
- more about yourself.

130
00:06:52,288 --> 00:06:55,089
- I'm Mac. Uh, I love Jesus,

131
00:06:55,090 --> 00:06:57,174
and therefore am not gay.

132
00:06:57,175 --> 00:07:00,344
- What?
- I am a farmer, and I plow the fields.

133
00:07:00,345 --> 00:07:05,641
And that's why I have this farmer's tan,
which plays in the fly-over states.

134
00:07:05,642 --> 00:07:09,770
And I live with Dennis in a friendship,

135
00:07:09,771 --> 00:07:12,982
man-to-man, nongay role.

136
00:07:12,983 --> 00:07:15,025
- Oh, okay. Yeah. Let's not...
- Right, Dennis?

137
00:07:15,026 --> 00:07:17,987
The more he tries to hammer it home,
the more it sounds like we do do it.

138
00:07:17,988 --> 00:07:20,614
- There is no gay here.
- It's irrelevant. He's gay, I'm straight.

139
00:07:20,615 --> 00:07:22,950
- They just live together.
- Yeah. Which is totally normal

140
00:07:22,951 --> 00:07:24,703
- for two middle-aged men.
- Right.

141
00:07:27,789 --> 00:07:29,415
- They like when I'm funny.
- Don't refer to them.

142
00:07:29,416 --> 00:07:31,584
They like when I'm funny.
- Did you notice that?
- No.

143
00:07:31,585 --> 00:07:34,420
Hey, you guys wanna hear the one
about the Chinaman's doctor?

144
00:07:34,421 --> 00:07:35,838
- No, no. Hang on.
- They don't.

145
00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:37,214
That is so racist.

146
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:40,426
I yelled at a coyote the other day.
Would anyone like to see a reenactment?

147
00:07:44,222 --> 00:07:46,724
- This is a good story.
- Yeah. It came at me, and I was like--

148
00:07:46,725 --> 00:07:48,851
- Tell 'em what you said.
- I was so super cool.

149
00:07:48,852 --> 00:07:50,769
I was like, "Later, bro."

150
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:52,481
No, you screamed at it.

151
00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:58,944
Well, this was a goddamn nightmare.
I mean, Charlie, what happened, dude?

152
00:07:58,945 --> 00:08:02,281
I confused the shampoo
with the Nair hair removal.

153
00:08:02,282 --> 00:08:04,450
And then, you know, it came off.

154
00:08:04,451 --> 00:08:07,703
Jesus Christ, man.
And, Mac, why are you back in the closet?

155
00:08:07,704 --> 00:08:09,371
I wanted to appeal to the fly-over states.

156
00:08:09,372 --> 00:08:11,040
Go woke, go broke.
That's what you always say.

157
00:08:11,041 --> 00:08:13,083
I don't say that, you say that, all right?

158
00:08:13,084 --> 00:08:15,461
And people were confused, all right?
They think we're a couple.

159
00:08:15,462 --> 00:08:18,832
Oh. Okay. Well, maybe
America is ready for us.

160
00:08:19,674 --> 00:08:22,301
There is no us.
Mac, stop trying to groom me, okay?

161
00:08:22,302 --> 00:08:24,470
And please stop saying,
"Go woke, go broke."

162
00:08:24,471 --> 00:08:25,971
What'd we get? What was our score?

163
00:08:25,972 --> 00:08:27,765
- Twenty-two.
- Out of what?

164
00:08:27,766 --> 00:08:29,600
Out of a goddamn 100!

165
00:08:29,601 --> 00:08:31,894
- Oh, is that low?
- Yeah-- That's very low.

166
00:08:31,895 --> 00:08:33,938
This is exactly
what I was talking about.

167
00:08:33,939 --> 00:08:35,397
That's why I had a script.

168
00:08:35,398 --> 00:08:38,317
That being said, you know, some of these
comments are a little bit confusing.

169
00:08:38,318 --> 00:08:40,778
I mean, like, they didn't like
when I said, "Speak of the devil."

170
00:08:40,779 --> 00:08:43,113
I didn't like that either. You know,
you shouldn't speak of Satan.

171
00:08:43,114 --> 00:08:45,699
- And you said, "speak of the devil."
- He was speaking of the devil.

172
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:47,785
- I heard that too.
- It's a figure of speech.

173
00:08:47,786 --> 00:08:49,286
- Mmm. You were speaking of Satan.
- Yeah.

174
00:08:49,287 --> 00:08:50,996
America doesn't like that,
and I don't like that.

175
00:08:50,997 --> 00:08:52,790
I was speaking of the person--

176
00:08:52,791 --> 00:08:54,250
So who tested the highest?

177
00:08:54,251 --> 00:08:57,962
Well... Mac and Dee
tested the highest, which is crazy.

178
00:08:57,963 --> 00:08:59,713
- Oh!
- Oh, yeah!

179
00:08:59,714 --> 00:09:01,799
- Well, well done.
- I didn't say you tested high.

180
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,551
I said you tested the highest, you know.

181
00:09:03,552 --> 00:09:06,804
Unbelievably, they thought Dee was funny,
except for the goddamn Chinaman comment.

182
00:09:06,805 --> 00:09:08,389
Which was completely inappropriate, bitch.

183
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:11,016
Listen, I can take a note. I'll go woke
and I'll switch to clean comedy.

184
00:09:11,017 --> 00:09:13,310
How about no comedy at all, okay?
That's what's woke.

185
00:09:13,311 --> 00:09:16,433
I mean, awaken to the fact
that you're just not funny.

186
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:18,441
- Dennis, what'd they like about me?
- Yeah.

187
00:09:19,276 --> 00:09:22,444
This one wanted to hear more
about your bad boy tendencies?

188
00:09:22,445 --> 00:09:24,530
- These have to be a mistake.
- I am a bad boy.

189
00:09:24,531 --> 00:09:26,532
Yeah. So you're gonna stick
with the straight thing?

190
00:09:26,533 --> 00:09:28,242
- I don't know. We'll see.
- It's working for you.

191
00:09:28,243 --> 00:09:30,703
- What'd they think about me?
- Well, they thought you had cancer.

192
00:09:30,704 --> 00:09:32,246
Why?

193
00:09:32,247 --> 00:09:34,957
- Because you do look like you have cancer.

194
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:36,876
And they were confused
about the volleyballs.

195
00:09:36,877 --> 00:09:39,753
- I mean, they didn't know what that was.
- That's crazy. What else confused them?

196
00:09:39,754 --> 00:09:40,880
Goddamn everything! I mean,

197
00:09:40,881 --> 00:09:44,091
they were very confused about mine and
Mac's living arrangement for some reason.

198
00:09:44,092 --> 00:09:47,563
Hey, uh, quick question.
Who scored the lowest?

199
00:09:49,298 --> 00:09:51,599
- That's just completely unclear.
- Can I see that?

200
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,183
- Just for a second.
- You know... No.

201
00:09:53,184 --> 00:09:55,644
You're not gonna get any information
from it, Dee.

202
00:09:55,645 --> 00:09:56,896
- It was Dennis.
- It was Dennis?

203
00:09:56,897 --> 00:10:00,066
Yeah, of course it was. Yeah. They thought
he was bossy and he looked old.

204
00:10:00,901 --> 00:10:02,443
I mean, somebody has to be
the boss, right?

205
00:10:02,444 --> 00:10:04,695
- Of dinner?
- "Why was the old man so bossy?

206
00:10:04,696 --> 00:10:05,905
He looked haggard."

207
00:10:05,906 --> 00:10:07,489
No, no, no. You're...
Now you're making stuff up.

208
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:08,866
"His features were so sunken,

209
00:10:08,867 --> 00:10:12,745
- it was hard to concentrate on the story."
- Old? Haggard? No, these are...

210
00:10:12,746 --> 00:10:14,663
No. That was a lighting thing.

211
00:10:14,664 --> 00:10:17,124
I gave you guys the best lighting
because I knew I looked the best,

212
00:10:17,125 --> 00:10:19,543
and I wanted you guys to look good too.
And I wanted them to...

213
00:10:19,544 --> 00:10:22,296
They... No. Old? Come on.
That's completely insane.

214
00:10:23,924 --> 00:10:25,758
Get your shit together!

215
00:10:27,405 --> 00:10:29,512
REH2

216
00:10:29,512 --> 00:10:31,680
Okay. Thank you all for coming. Uh...

217
00:10:31,681 --> 00:10:36,811
Most of you are new, and I think some
of you may have been at the last show.

218
00:10:37,395 --> 00:10:41,316
I guess you wanted to see this again.
That's... That's good, I suppose.

219
00:10:41,942 --> 00:10:43,901
Uh, well, for those of you who are new...

220
00:10:44,986 --> 00:10:47,013
Great crowd out there.

221
00:10:47,447 --> 00:10:48,656
- What are you wearing?
- Oh.

222
00:10:48,657 --> 00:10:50,991
<i>I'm going for the bad guy
in Commando look.</i>

223
00:10:50,992 --> 00:10:52,701
You know, like,
"Who's straighter than that?"

224
00:10:52,702 --> 00:10:54,036
Dude, you look like Freddie Mercury.

225
00:10:54,037 --> 00:10:55,996
Oh, cool.
He's like the straightest man alive.

226
00:10:55,997 --> 00:10:58,666
He couldn't have been more gay.
I mean, he was in a band called Queen.

227
00:10:58,667 --> 00:11:01,293
You know what? If you want to look
straight, go grab the duster or something.

228
00:11:01,294 --> 00:11:03,921
- What's with the face tape?
- This? Well, it's just, you know...

229
00:11:03,922 --> 00:11:05,881
It's a way to kind of tighten
the skin up a little bit.

230
00:11:05,882 --> 00:11:08,509
Give me a more youthful appearance.
You know what I mean?

231
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:09,694
Okay.

232
00:11:10,178 --> 00:11:11,303
What is this?

233
00:11:11,304 --> 00:11:13,722
It's just a clean comedy look.
It's classic.

234
00:11:14,849 --> 00:11:17,768
Can we not, okay?
I mean, a rubber chicken?

235
00:11:17,769 --> 00:11:19,103
- Are you ser--
- Yeah. Come on.

236
00:11:19,104 --> 00:11:21,355
- Is this tape coming off? Goddamn it.
- You got tape on your face?

237
00:11:21,356 --> 00:11:23,692
- Yeah, and it's not sticking very well.
- I think you need more.

238
00:11:24,234 --> 00:11:25,484
You think I need more of it?

239
00:11:25,485 --> 00:11:28,320
Well, yeah. You said you wanted
to look youthful, yeah?

240
00:11:28,321 --> 00:11:31,323
Yeah. I don't want to look crazy. Maybe
I'll just tighten it up a little bit.

241
00:11:31,324 --> 00:11:32,866
- Yeah.
- A little bit. Yeah.

242
00:11:32,867 --> 00:11:34,576
- Yeah. Okay. All right.
- Yeah.

243
00:11:34,577 --> 00:11:37,497
So, without further ado, let's begin.

244
00:11:51,261 --> 00:11:52,262
Stop.

245
00:12:05,859 --> 00:12:10,487
Well. Here we are. Uh...
I sure am excited to see Frank.

246
00:12:10,488 --> 00:12:12,656
Oh, gosh. I can't wait
to meet the lucky lady.

247
00:12:12,657 --> 00:12:14,783
Yeah. Frank likes her, I'll like her.

248
00:12:14,784 --> 00:12:16,326
- Okay.
- Yeah. I wonder where they are.

249
00:12:16,327 --> 00:12:21,262
Oh, well, our lovable old pal Charlie's
on his way over with them right now.

250
00:12:21,416 --> 00:12:23,709
- Oh.
- Look at that.

251
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:27,621
Speak of the... Speak of the guy.

252
00:12:28,089 --> 00:12:29,340
Here they are. Oh, it's open.

253
00:12:29,966 --> 00:12:31,676
Hello, everybody.

254
00:12:33,887 --> 00:12:37,163
Say hello to Frank and Frank's date.

255
00:12:37,515 --> 00:12:38,958
Heya, gang.

256
00:12:39,476 --> 00:12:41,436
- I'm getting paid for this, right?
- Yeah, yeah.

257
00:12:42,562 --> 00:12:44,855
Well, come on in. Hey, Charlie.
How you doin', man?

258
00:12:44,856 --> 00:12:47,775
Not sure why you're doing that accent,
you know?

259
00:12:47,776 --> 00:12:50,152
Pretty confusing, you know.
I must not have heard you correctly,

260
00:12:50,153 --> 00:12:52,029
because you are from right here
in Philadelphia.

261
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:53,989
- No, that's not true actually.
- It is.

262
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:56,575
No, I'm from Eastern European territory.

263
00:12:56,576 --> 00:12:58,619
Uh... So, what's for dinner?

264
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:00,412
Beet soup, I hope.

265
00:13:00,413 --> 00:13:02,164
- Stop it.
- What are you doing?

266
00:13:02,165 --> 00:13:05,292
I'm just talking
in my natural European way.

267
00:13:05,293 --> 00:13:07,669
I like it, because white people
doing funny accents is not woke.

268
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:08,796
I thought we were doing woke.

269
00:13:08,797 --> 00:13:10,368
Shut up!

270
00:13:14,552 --> 00:13:17,555
So, Frank and Frank's date, I'm Dennis.

271
00:13:18,056 --> 00:13:23,227
Um... I live here with Mac in a totally
age-appropriate and platonic relationship.

272
00:13:23,228 --> 00:13:26,438
But like you, Frank,
I hope to meet my special someone someday.

273
00:13:26,439 --> 00:13:27,689
Meh.

274
00:13:27,690 --> 00:13:28,775
Yeah.

275
00:13:31,736 --> 00:13:33,362
- Where the hell did that come from?
- Oh.

276
00:13:35,865 --> 00:13:38,951
Oh, okay. It was funny. It was funny.

277
00:13:38,952 --> 00:13:41,662
When I'm not palling around
with Dennis platonically in the bedroom,

278
00:13:41,663 --> 00:13:44,957
I like to strap on my leathers
and perform badass stunts.

279
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:47,168
Would anyone like to see a backflip?

280
00:13:50,672 --> 00:13:53,257
Okay. Well, hey now,
let's not encourage him.

281
00:13:53,258 --> 00:13:54,341
He can't actually do one.

282
00:13:54,342 --> 00:13:55,885
- He can't.
- Right? No, he can't.

283
00:14:00,682 --> 00:14:04,685
So, guys, guess how much me
and this broad banged boots?

284
00:14:04,686 --> 00:14:05,770
Tell 'em, honey.

285
00:14:06,271 --> 00:14:07,604
- What are you doing?
- Do I have a line?

286
00:14:07,605 --> 00:14:09,022
- No.
- I didn't get a script.

287
00:14:09,023 --> 00:14:11,149
No. Artemis, can you stick to the script?

288
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:13,527
The script's a little thin,
so I'm trying to just ad-lib.

289
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:17,447
What are you doing?

290
00:14:17,448 --> 00:14:19,241
I'm doing a goddamn backflip.

291
00:14:19,242 --> 00:14:20,325
You can't stop me.

292
00:14:20,326 --> 00:14:23,036
Because the power of Christ compels me.

293
00:14:23,037 --> 00:14:24,872
- Badass.
- Stop.

294
00:14:27,417 --> 00:14:28,459
Oh, no. Oh.

295
00:14:33,256 --> 00:14:35,507
Seventy-five. Am I reading that right?

296
00:14:35,508 --> 00:14:38,010
- Yeah. That's a big improvement.
- Wow. We did great.

297
00:14:38,011 --> 00:14:41,096
It was a goddamn circus.
What are you guys talking about?

298
00:14:41,097 --> 00:14:44,349
No...
Charlie, why did you do an accent?

299
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:46,977
Well, dude, I look weird.
I don't feel like myself.

300
00:14:46,978 --> 00:14:48,395
So I figured I'd be someone different.

301
00:14:48,396 --> 00:14:51,481
<i>Like that funny cousin in
Perfect Strangers? Remember that guy?</i>

302
00:14:51,482 --> 00:14:53,150
- Yes.
- Yeah. No, I like you doing a character,

303
00:14:53,151 --> 00:14:54,985
but don't make it funny.
I got the jokes covered.

304
00:14:54,986 --> 00:14:56,528
- Oh. Do you, Dee?
- I'm the funny...

305
00:14:56,529 --> 00:14:58,238
Do you? Because this card says,

306
00:14:58,239 --> 00:15:01,533
"The one in the plaid suit seemed sad
and desperate.

307
00:15:01,534 --> 00:15:03,994
And I was only laughing
because I was so uncomfortable."

308
00:15:03,995 --> 00:15:05,704
Oh, yeah? You know what this one says?

309
00:15:05,705 --> 00:15:07,748
- What?
- "What's with the angry man

310
00:15:07,749 --> 00:15:10,250
with the old face who's constantly yelling
at his boyfriend?"

311
00:15:10,251 --> 00:15:12,628
I could not have made it more clear
that he's not my boyfriend!

312
00:15:12,629 --> 00:15:14,838
- You kept saying it over and over.
- Oh, my God.

313
00:15:14,839 --> 00:15:18,467
And how could I possibly look old?
I mean, no.

314
00:15:18,468 --> 00:15:19,843
Who scored the highest?

315
00:15:19,844 --> 00:15:21,261
I think you did.

316
00:15:21,262 --> 00:15:22,805
Oh, yeah? Let me see.

317
00:15:24,057 --> 00:15:28,603
"I love when the vampire slayer busted out
the crucifix on his old vampire lover."

318
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:32,064
Me? "Old vampire lover"?

319
00:15:32,065 --> 00:15:35,442
Let's lean into that.
Yeah, I can be like a vanilla Blade,

320
00:15:35,443 --> 00:15:37,527
and I could stab you in the heart
with the crucifix and be...

321
00:15:37,528 --> 00:15:39,613
- Stop! Goddamn it.
- And then you kiss...

322
00:15:39,614 --> 00:15:40,990
For the love of God, stop.

323
00:15:41,908 --> 00:15:43,326
Okay, all right. You know what?

324
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:46,411
You two will limit your exchanges

325
00:15:46,412 --> 00:15:49,414
to "hello," "yes" and "no." And that's it.

326
00:15:49,415 --> 00:15:53,251
And the rest of you will refrain from
doing accents or personas of any kind.

327
00:15:53,252 --> 00:15:55,045
I will do all the costumes,
hair and makeup.

328
00:15:55,046 --> 00:15:57,673
And there will be
no other surprises at all.

329
00:15:57,674 --> 00:16:03,012
And so help me God,
we will get this right!

330
00:16:04,514 --> 00:16:06,306
I mean,
I get a vampire vibe off that, right?

331
00:16:06,307 --> 00:16:08,183
- Do you not?
- We're gonna get slashed.

332
00:16:08,184 --> 00:16:10,143
Yeah, like a Count Dracula thing.

333
00:16:10,398 --> 00:16:11,980
REH3

334
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:13,563
Okay. Thank you all for coming.

335
00:16:13,564 --> 00:16:17,151
I see mostly familiar faces,
so welcome back.

336
00:16:18,027 --> 00:16:19,027
That crowd is amped.

337
00:16:19,028 --> 00:16:20,112
- Yeah, well...
- Oh, yeah?

338
00:16:20,113 --> 00:16:22,114
...too bad Dennis cut everything they liked.

339
00:16:22,115 --> 00:16:26,451
Come on, Dee. No, trust me. Trust me.
Guys, this is exactly what America wants.

340
00:16:26,452 --> 00:16:29,121
Didn't it start, like, here,
and then go up and over? Like it would...

341
00:16:29,122 --> 00:16:31,707
<i>- No, no. I mean, you're not a werewolf.
- I'm thinking of Teen Wolf, aren't I?</i>

342
00:16:31,708 --> 00:16:34,042
- I think so. Yeah.
- I'm just blown away, man.

343
00:16:34,043 --> 00:16:36,670
I just, like, don't know how
you got the wig that good, you know?

344
00:16:36,671 --> 00:16:38,715
Like, do you wear a wig?
This is crazy, dude.

345
00:16:39,549 --> 00:16:42,300
Do I wear a wig? No. Nonsense.

346
00:16:42,301 --> 00:16:43,593
- For real, though. Do you?
- Stop!

347
00:16:43,594 --> 00:16:47,681
Dude. All right, fine, man.
I'm just thinking, it's so good, man.

348
00:16:47,682 --> 00:16:49,307
- Just...
- All right, the show's gonna start.

349
00:16:49,308 --> 00:16:51,601
Do you have time to do yourself,
and then we'll get going?

350
00:16:51,602 --> 00:16:53,186
What do you mean? I did do me.

351
00:16:53,187 --> 00:16:56,148
- Oh, you're all done?
- Yeah, I put the... Do I need more tape?

352
00:16:56,149 --> 00:16:57,442
Uh... Well...

353
00:17:02,822 --> 00:17:04,741
- We should bow. We should bow.
- Absolutely.

354
00:17:05,241 --> 00:17:07,325
- No, don't bow. Don't bow.
- But they're clapping so much.

355
00:17:07,326 --> 00:17:10,038
I know. Don't, like...
Don't even notice that they're there.

356
00:17:18,588 --> 00:17:20,264
- You take my chicken?
- Mm-hmm.

357
00:17:20,965 --> 00:17:24,843
Mac. I bet you have a boom box
under that table, don't you?

358
00:17:24,844 --> 00:17:26,762
- Nope.
- Yeah, you do. Let me see it.

359
00:17:26,763 --> 00:17:28,389
- I don't have one.
- Let me see it.

360
00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:30,515
- You better do it, dude.
- Just do it.

361
00:17:30,516 --> 00:17:34,227
I was...
I was gonna play a cool song.

362
00:17:34,228 --> 00:17:37,314
- Let's see what you were gonna play.
- It was fun and cool.

363
00:17:37,315 --> 00:17:39,191
<i>- Kid Rock. How fun.
- Bawitdaba--</i>

364
00:17:39,192 --> 00:17:40,984
But we're not doing that.
This is gonna be a classy evening,

365
00:17:40,985 --> 00:17:44,504
so I came prepared with something
a little different.

366
00:17:47,742 --> 00:17:50,577
There we go. Isn't that nice?

367
00:17:50,578 --> 00:17:51,995
- I guess.
- Yeah.

368
00:17:51,996 --> 00:17:56,626
Well, here we are.
I'm so excited to see Frank.

369
00:17:57,752 --> 00:18:01,077
Yeah. Uh...
I can't wait to meet the lucky lady.

370
00:18:01,756 --> 00:18:03,924
- If Frank likes her, I'll like her.
- Yeah.

371
00:18:03,925 --> 00:18:05,626
So where are they?

372
00:18:07,095 --> 00:18:09,432
Oh. Here they are. Speak of--

373
00:18:09,432 --> 00:18:11,089
It's open.

374
00:18:14,018 --> 00:18:16,019
Well, hello. Hey, guys.

375
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:17,354
Welcome. Come on in.

376
00:18:17,355 --> 00:18:19,272
Yeah, close the door. Yeah. Good.

377
00:18:19,273 --> 00:18:20,982
- Like we rehearsed.
- Hello.

378
00:18:20,983 --> 00:18:22,067
Hello.

379
00:18:22,068 --> 00:18:25,113
Wonderful. Well, I'm Dennis.

380
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:28,949
And, uh, this is my apartment.
I live here with my friend, Mac.

381
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:32,452
My longtime friend.
But not eternal, you know.

382
00:18:32,453 --> 00:18:36,832
'Cause we're not vampires.
Obviously.

383
00:18:36,833 --> 00:18:39,252
That... That'd be crazy. Um...

384
00:18:41,921 --> 00:18:44,005
But, yeah. Soon to have our own places.

385
00:18:44,006 --> 00:18:48,051
Uh, but not because we're poor.
Uh, but because we're economically savvy.

386
00:18:48,052 --> 00:18:50,680
And... But still quite young.

387
00:18:53,724 --> 00:18:55,176
Oh, Dee, you-you were saying?

388
00:18:57,687 --> 00:19:00,772
Hi, I'm Dee. Frank was a great father.

389
00:19:00,773 --> 00:19:02,158
No.

390
00:19:04,527 --> 00:19:07,054
You got a great sense of humor, Frank. No.

391
00:19:07,864 --> 00:19:09,364
Hey, Charlie. You had a--

392
00:19:11,325 --> 00:19:13,368
Shoot, do I have a line?

393
00:19:13,369 --> 00:19:16,746
No, you were just gonna say something
off the cuff, I think.

394
00:19:16,747 --> 00:19:19,624
Uh, I don't remember what it---
I'll make something up. Um...

395
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:22,455
Hey, Frank's date. Where are you from?

396
00:19:23,296 --> 00:19:24,839
Hello, hello.

397
00:19:25,506 --> 00:19:28,842
- Yes. Hello, hi. Hi, hello. Yeah, hi!
- Hello.

398
00:19:28,843 --> 00:19:30,427
- Hi!
- Hi! Hello!

399
00:19:30,428 --> 00:19:32,433
What is this?

400
00:19:33,514 --> 00:19:35,974
Well, you don't talk.
I mean, what are you doing, man?

401
00:19:35,975 --> 00:19:38,226
The audience never talks
to the cast of the show.

402
00:19:38,227 --> 00:19:41,104
Perhaps a flip to lighten the mood?

403
00:19:41,105 --> 00:19:42,648
- Yeah.
- Yes.

404
00:19:43,232 --> 00:19:46,151
No, no, no, no, no.
You're not gonna do a flip.

405
00:19:46,152 --> 00:19:49,404
Because it doesn't make sense to do a flip
in the middle of a dinner for no reason.

406
00:19:49,405 --> 00:19:51,874
- Let your boyfriend flip.
- Yeah!

407
00:19:52,074 --> 00:19:54,326
- He's not my boyfriend!
- I'm with this guy. Let him flip.

408
00:19:54,327 --> 00:19:55,577
What are you doing?

409
00:19:55,578 --> 00:19:57,245
- Stop it.
- And add one flip. You know what I mean?

410
00:19:57,246 --> 00:19:59,998
- Let him do just one flip.
- All right, I'll do one. A quick accent.

411
00:19:59,999 --> 00:20:02,951
No, you're not listening!
You don't understand!

412
00:20:11,052 --> 00:20:12,755
You're not getting this.

413
00:20:14,555 --> 00:20:16,441
We are not lovers.

414
00:20:17,558 --> 00:20:19,142
We're simply roommates, you see.

415
00:20:19,143 --> 00:20:23,088
It's not so difficult to understand.
Not so difficult at all.

416
00:20:23,689 --> 00:20:29,402
Two men entwined only by the walls
that house us and the passage of time.

417
00:20:29,403 --> 00:20:31,705
That is all. Nothing more.

418
00:20:33,157 --> 00:20:37,494
We are all classy men and women alike.

419
00:20:37,495 --> 00:20:40,664
But none more classy than me.
Refined and dignified

420
00:20:40,665 --> 00:20:43,124
and not the least bit abnormal in any way.

421
00:20:43,125 --> 00:20:46,295
I need you to see this.

422
00:20:47,338 --> 00:20:48,672
Yes?

423
00:20:48,673 --> 00:20:52,969
All is well and palatable and good.

424
00:20:55,054 --> 00:20:56,054
You must know this

425
00:20:56,055 --> 00:21:00,622
and you must reflect it as such
on the cards that you've been given.

426
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:04,438
Do you understand? I need this of you.

427
00:21:06,315 --> 00:21:08,500
You must make it so.

428
00:21:11,821 --> 00:21:13,973
There was another show...

429
00:21:16,158 --> 00:21:17,450
<i>by the name of Family Fight</i>

430
00:21:17,451 --> 00:21:20,912
and I was not properly represented
on that show

431
00:21:20,913 --> 00:21:27,318
and I cannot and will... ...not
abide another failure of that magnitude.

432
00:21:34,343 --> 00:21:41,142
I just need you to see me
as... ...I am.

433
00:21:44,061 --> 00:21:48,328
I need this. I need this from you.

434
00:21:53,538 --> 00:21:59,337
I need this from you. Please.

435
00:22:00,077 --> 00:22:01,244
This is amazing.

436
00:22:01,245 --> 00:22:03,539
What the fuck's he doing?

437
00:22:06,167 --> 00:22:09,794
<i>So that's why you've been so crazed?
Because you panicked on Family Fight?</i>

438
00:22:09,795 --> 00:22:12,547
Yes, dude.
You don't understand the humiliation.

439
00:22:12,548 --> 00:22:14,132
I hope for your sake you never do.

440
00:22:14,133 --> 00:22:15,834
Dee, how'd we score this time?

441
00:22:17,219 --> 00:22:19,554
- Three.
- Three what?

442
00:22:19,555 --> 00:22:21,097
The number three out of a hundred.

443
00:22:21,098 --> 00:22:22,766
- That's it?
- Yeah, they hated it.

444
00:22:22,767 --> 00:22:24,726
Dennis scared the shit out of 'em.

445
00:22:24,727 --> 00:22:27,771
Well, look, man, forget it.
Like, can we just be us, okay?

446
00:22:27,772 --> 00:22:30,523
We're trying to please everybody
and, like, that never works, man.

447
00:22:30,524 --> 00:22:32,651
Like people need to get ya
or they don't get ya.

448
00:22:32,652 --> 00:22:34,195
- You know what I'm saying?
- Yes.

449
00:22:34,695 --> 00:22:36,071
All right. Yeah.

450
00:22:36,072 --> 00:22:39,016
Does anybody else think it's weird
that they haven't showed up yet?

451
00:22:39,116 --> 00:22:40,660
- That who hasn't showed up?
- Yeah.

452
00:22:42,119 --> 00:22:43,912
Frank, the producers. The entire TV show.

453
00:22:43,913 --> 00:22:46,498
I mean, we've been doing this whole thing
for a while now.

454
00:22:46,499 --> 00:22:49,292
Oh, shit. Yeah, they should've been here
by now. What's it been, like, a week?

455
00:22:49,293 --> 00:22:50,670
It's been a month.

456
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:53,338
- We've been doing this for a month?
- Yeah, it's been a month.

457
00:22:53,339 --> 00:22:56,049
- I think it's been a solid month.
- Look up the show. Look it up.

458
00:22:56,050 --> 00:22:57,968
I'm gonna look it up. Give me a sec.

459
00:23:00,596 --> 00:23:02,555
That episode aired two weeks ago.

460
00:23:02,556 --> 00:23:04,099
- That's the hometown visit?
- Yes.

461
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:05,225
What the--

462
00:23:05,226 --> 00:23:08,061
<i>{\an8}This is a big day
for me! I can't wait to see my--</i>

463
00:23:08,062 --> 00:23:12,816
{\an8}Oh! There's my family.
Ah! It's so, so nice to see you.

464
00:23:12,817 --> 00:23:15,260
- Dad.
- It's so good to see you.

465
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:16,444
- What the--

466
00:23:16,445 --> 00:23:18,405
- Who the hell are these people?
- He replaced us.

467
00:23:18,406 --> 00:23:21,283
<i>- He replaced us?
- It is so good to see you.</i>

468
00:23:21,784 --> 00:23:25,578
<i>They would never do anything
to embarrass me in any way.</i>

469
00:23:25,579 --> 00:23:27,297
- Dude.
- Yeah.

470
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:30,805
I guess he went woke.
And he didn't go broke.
