Mom, dad,
this is Crown
Prince Mohammed bin Salman.

7
00:00:22,463 --> 00:00:25,433
And we're together
now, getting off gorgeous.

8
00:00:25,433 --> 00:00:27,069
But we are vibing.

9
00:00:27,069 --> 00:00:29,679
- You are too kind.
- Habibi.

10
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:32,857
Habibi Habibi
What a word.

11
00:00:32,857 --> 00:00:35,764
But we've been having
a lot of fun in the Middle East.

12
00:00:35,764 --> 00:00:37,186
I've been having a great time.

13
00:00:37,186 --> 00:00:40,757
We've been eating a lot
of meals, sitting on the floor,

14
00:00:40,757 --> 00:00:45,348
dipping our fingers straight
into various groups and spreads

15
00:00:45,348 --> 00:00:47,502
that I politely scrape
under the rug

16
00:00:47,502 --> 00:00:51,523
and go eat at a mobile
McDonald's.
That you build for me
isn't that way.

17
00:00:52,157 --> 00:00:54,341
BA ba
ba ba ba ba. He's loving it.

18
00:00:54,341 --> 00:00:59,265
I, of course, am a big fan
of everything that Saudi Arabia has to offer,

19
00:00:59,265 --> 00:01:01,769
from the oil
to the money

20
00:01:01,769 --> 00:01:03,668
to end of list.

21
00:01:03,668 --> 00:01:08,280
But it's been a fantastic week
in the Middle East.

22
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:12,382
I also went to Qatar, the UAE

23
00:01:12,382 --> 00:01:16,580
and much like God did during
Passover, I skipped Israel.

24
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:17,751
Oh well,

25
00:01:17,751 --> 00:01:21,835
I bet you were happy about that
though.
You like that, right?

26
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:24,038
No comment.

27
00:01:24,038 --> 00:01:26,376
Don't comment.
You don't want to say anything.

Cancel culture.

29
00:01:27,357 --> 00:01:31,543
But I did make this trip.
I didn't make this trip
for myself.

30
00:01:31,543 --> 00:01:35,230
I want to make that clear.
I did this
for the American people

31
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:39,647
and in many ways myself
by my personal enrichment.

32
00:01:39,647 --> 00:01:42,223
I did that too.
I did very well on this trip.

33
00:01:42,223 --> 00:01:44,466
Got a lot of cool stuff.

34
00:01:44,466 --> 00:01:49,058
The Qataris
gave me a $400 million plane.
Can you believe that?

35
00:01:49,058 --> 00:01:51,854
And people said
that was some sort of bribe.
Not true,

36
00:01:51,854 --> 00:01:55,917
not true because they haven't
asked for anything in return.

37
00:01:55,917 --> 00:01:58,364
Well, not yet.

38
00:01:58,364 --> 00:02:01,003
All right, so it's a pre bribe.
It's a pre bribe.

39
00:02:01,003 --> 00:02:05,977
But now people are saying
I should really be flying
in an American plane.

40
00:02:05,977 --> 00:02:07,326
No, thanks. Andy,

41
00:02:07,326 --> 00:02:10,628
have you seen
what's going on with our planes?

42
00:02:10,628 --> 00:02:13,902
The radar is down
and the screen is blank.

43
00:02:13,902 --> 00:02:15,209
Newark

44
00:02:15,849 --> 00:02:18,859
Darling, watch.
Where are we going?

45
00:02:18,859 --> 00:02:21,627
Where are we flying for
our vacation?

46
00:02:21,627 --> 00:02:23,848
I need directly into the ground.

47
00:02:23,848 --> 00:02:26,266
But we just made it big.
Oh shut up!

48
00:02:26,266 --> 00:02:30,001
But we just made a big airplane
deal with the Crown Prince.

49
00:02:30,001 --> 00:02:30,917
Tell them about it.

50
00:02:30,917 --> 00:02:36,557
Saudi Arabia will buy $1 billion
worth of aircraft from Boeing.

51
00:02:36,557 --> 00:02:38,061
Your funeral.

52
00:02:38,061 --> 00:02:42,772
I met with the leader of the UAE
in Abu Dhabi.

53
00:02:42,772 --> 00:02:44,872
We like to say Abu Dhabi.

54
00:02:44,872 --> 00:02:50,690
Abu Dhabi do like the
late great Fred Flintstone.

55
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:56,083
The UAE
promised to invest over $1
trillion in the US.

56
00:02:56,083 --> 00:03:00,879
I love Dubai because they Dubai
a lot of weapons.

57
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:03,923
But I've had a great trip
here in the Middle East.

58
00:03:03,923 --> 00:03:07,757
It was very much a boys trip.
I don't think
I saw a single woman.

59
00:03:07,757 --> 00:03:09,399
What's up with that,

60
00:03:09,399 --> 00:03:12,102
All the time Just walking into a room
full of boys.

61
00:03:12,174 --> 00:03:14,860
Hi, boys. Boys again?

62
00:03:14,969 --> 00:03:16,762
The women are all hiding.

63
00:03:16,763 --> 00:03:21,066
It's like a nation of Melania's.

64
00:03:21,067 --> 00:03:22,201
Very funny.

65
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:22,869
There it is.

66
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:24,971
Look at that baby. I'm
going to look that up.

67
00:03:25,071 --> 00:03:27,139
I'm cooking.
I'm having a great time.

68
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:28,273
I was just going to say it.

69
00:03:28,274 --> 00:03:30,509
I love the Arabs.
I love the Arabs.

70
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:33,479
I don't want to go home.
Let me stay.

71
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,914
Get me to Allah's country.

72
00:03:35,915 --> 00:03:37,416
Everyone loves me here.

73
00:03:37,417 --> 00:03:39,718
They're not allowed to.
Not right now.

74
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:40,819

00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:43,322

next to mine and stay.

We call ours UTAH

so I can't stay here

90

in the Middle East. In fact,
you know what?

91

I can't even stay in this sketch
much long going.

I have to leave. You know what?

93

finale season 50.

Hey, let's take the stairs.

668
00:28:23,303 --> 00:28:26,805
It's only 30 flights.

669
00:28:26,806 --> 00:28:27,706
Scarlett.

670
00:28:27,707 --> 00:28:31,844
Scarlett's my Jurassic harlot.

671
00:28:31,845 --> 00:28:34,513
We should be talking you
that way.

672
00:28:34,514 --> 00:28:36,048
I'm married.

673
00:28:36,049 --> 00:28:40,619
Probably shouldn't
be doing a lot of things.

674
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:41,487
It's better.

675
00:28:41,488 --> 00:28:43,722
Watch it. Mr.

676
00:28:43,723 --> 00:28:44,723
Moo-Deng

677
00:28:44,724 --> 00:28:46,392
Listen,

678
00:28:46,393 --> 00:28:49,094
you know Collins, my SNL brother
and I never did

679
00:28:49,095 --> 00:28:51,663
anything to hurt him back.

680
00:28:51,664 --> 00:28:54,833
I f his wife.

681
00:28:54,834 --> 00:28:57,503
There's something
I wanted to ask you.

682
00:28:57,504 --> 00:29:00,773
What? I guess I was wondering.

683
00:29:00,774 --> 00:29:03,810
What that yang do

684
00:29:09,015 --> 00:29:10,516
Scar

685
00:29:10,517 --> 00:29:12,251
We do. Need protection.

686
00:29:12,252 --> 00:29:13,619
No. It's fine.

687
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:16,255
I can bottom

688
00:29:16,256 --> 00:29:20,894
Ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow!

689
00:29:22,896 --> 00:29:25,764
I need to see you again tonight.

690
00:29:25,765 --> 00:29:27,199
I'll cover for you.

691
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,134
You can buy mine.

692
00:29:29,135 --> 00:29:31,437
Yeah. Think I might like to.

693
00:29:31,438 --> 00:29:34,506
Am going to wear something
pretty.

694
00:29:34,507 --> 00:29:38,610
Okay.

695
00:29:38,611 --> 00:29:45,851
Oh. Hi.

696
00:29:45,852 --> 00:29:49,054
Hey. We
hanging out tonight.

697
00:29:49,055 --> 00:29:49,688
Right?

698
00:29:49,689 --> 00:29:53,058
Should I come on in?

699
00:29:53,059 --> 00:29:54,893
Oh. Oh. Nice place.

700
00:29:54,894 --> 00:29:57,663
So, are we cooking?

701
00:29:57,664 --> 00:30:01,767
Hey. Hey, listen,
tendies in the air fryer.

702
00:30:01,768 --> 00:30:04,804
I can see it at rehearsal.

703
00:30:07,173 --> 00:30:08,741
You sleep with ego?

704
00:30:08,742 --> 00:30:10,109
What do you want me to say?

705
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:11,877
I don't. Know that
we had a connection.

706
00:30:11,878 --> 00:30:13,112
Oh, so now we're dating?

707
00:30:13,113 --> 00:30:15,514
I just found out who you were
this morning.

708
00:30:15,515 --> 00:30:16,348
Oh, Simon.

709
00:30:16,349 --> 00:30:20,719
Nothing to.
You got to suffocating me.

710
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:21,587
Screw it.

711
00:30:21,588 --> 00:30:24,390
I'm going
to Tokyo and inventing I.

712
00:30:24,391 --> 00:30:27,427
By the way.

713
00:30:29,562 --> 00:30:32,931
Hey, mama, I need you. To.

714
00:30:32,932 --> 00:30:34,733
You keep asking yourself why.

715
00:30:34,734 --> 00:30:36,201
You'll drive yourself crazy.

716
00:30:36,202 --> 00:30:38,871
I got gaslit by Bowen

717
00:30:38,872 --> 00:30:40,106
Yang

718
00:30:43,443 --> 00:30:44,977
Go to Disneyland Tokyo.

719
00:30:44,978 --> 00:30:47,212
Is that Emily Ratajkowski? Yeah.

720
00:30:47,213 --> 00:30:49,114
Okay, listen, I.

721
00:30:49,115 --> 00:30:51,216
Never get your back blown out
by a gay guy.

722
00:30:51,217 --> 00:30:55,355
Amen sister

723
00:31:04,898 --> 00:31:11,370
Work. Hi.

724
00:31:11,371 --> 00:31:13,572
Can you press 147, please?

725
00:31:13,573 --> 00:31:14,873
Sure.

726
00:31:14,874 --> 00:31:17,343
Thank you. God.

727
00:31:17,344 --> 00:31:18,510
- Oh, you're Mike.
- Myers

728
00:31:18,511 --> 00:31:19,478
Yes, I am. Yes.

729
00:31:19,479 --> 00:31:24,416
Thank you.

730
00:31:24,417 --> 00:31:26,385
Dan, this is my staff.

731
00:31:26,386 --> 00:31:27,553
Good to meet you, though.

732
00:31:27,554 --> 00:31:30,255
Nice to meet you. Hi.

733
00:31:30,256 --> 00:31:32,458
Sorry to bother you.
I just have to say this.

734
00:31:32,459 --> 00:31:35,160
I'm a huge fan of yours, Mr.
Meyers. Oh.

735
00:31:35,161 --> 00:31:37,096
Thank you. That's very,
very kind. Thank you.

736
00:31:37,097 --> 00:31:38,163
And what's your name?

737
00:31:38,164 --> 00:31:40,666
I'm Janice,
and I just love all your movies.

738
00:31:40,667 --> 00:31:43,902
My girlfriends and I quote,
track, like, all the time. Oh.

739
00:31:43,903 --> 00:31:44,337
Thank you.

740
00:31:44,804 --> 00:31:46,505
That's a little weird, but,
Thank you.

741
00:31:46,506 --> 00:31:47,473
Thank you.

742
00:31:47,474 --> 00:31:48,907
It's my first time in New York.

743
00:31:48,908 --> 00:31:50,209
You just never know
what celebrity

744
00:31:50,210 --> 00:31:53,112
you're going
to run into here. It's true.

745
00:31:53,113 --> 00:31:56,248
Oh, my God, is that Kanye West?

746
00:31:56,249 --> 00:31:56,816
Yeah.

747
00:31:57,183 --> 00:32:00,252
What are you talking about
with my song?

748
00:32:00,253 --> 00:32:02,554
Come on,
give me one good reason.

749
00:32:02,555 --> 00:32:04,456
Besides that,

750
00:32:04,457 --> 00:32:06,692
besides that.

751
00:32:06,693 --> 00:32:08,060
How is it not relatable?

752
00:32:08,061 --> 00:32:10,896
Everybody got a cousin.

753
00:32:10,897 --> 00:32:12,731
Oh, I guess it's my SOP again.

754
00:32:12,732 --> 00:32:15,100
So nice to meet you, Mr. Meyer.
No, it is not.

755
00:32:15,101 --> 00:32:17,069
It is not your stuff.
What are you doing?

756
00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:19,505
You can't leave me alone in here
with him. Fine.

757
00:32:19,506 --> 00:32:23,075
I heard he's doing.

758
00:32:23,076 --> 00:32:24,376
Okay.

759
00:32:24,377 --> 00:32:26,578
You might. Meyers. Right.

760
00:32:26,579 --> 00:32:28,347
Kanye. What's up man?

761
00:32:28,348 --> 00:32:31,216
It's just. Yay
now. Sorry, gay, I.

762
00:32:31,217 --> 00:32:32,518
I guess it's been a while.

763
00:32:32,519 --> 00:32:32,952
Yeah.

764
00:32:33,386 --> 00:32:35,954
Since that Hurricane
Katrina benefit.

765
00:32:35,955 --> 00:32:37,122
Yes. You know,

766
00:32:37,123 --> 00:32:39,091
when I told the world
that George Bush don't care

767
00:32:39,092 --> 00:32:41,427
about black people on live TV.

768
00:32:41,428 --> 00:32:45,464
Yes. And you just had to
stand there looking stupid?

769
00:32:45,465 --> 00:32:47,866
Yes. So,

770
00:32:47,867 --> 00:32:49,002
What do you been up to?

771
00:32:49,102 --> 00:32:49,968
Oh, me?

772
00:32:49,969 --> 00:32:52,971
I'm in the KKK now.

773
00:32:52,972 --> 00:32:54,106
Of course you are.

774
00:32:54,107 --> 00:32:55,274
Yes, yes.

775
00:32:55,275 --> 00:32:56,108
How's your kids?

776
00:32:56,109 --> 00:32:59,111
My kids. My kids are safe.

777
00:32:59,112 --> 00:32:59,912
That's good.

778
00:32:59,913 --> 00:33:02,114
Family stability is important.

779
00:33:02,115 --> 00:33:04,483
Isn't it, though? Yes.

780
00:33:04,484 --> 00:33:05,150
Yeah.

781
00:33:05,151 --> 00:33:07,052
Disney stuff is crazy, right?

782
00:33:07,053 --> 00:33:08,687
What? Daddy?

783
00:33:08,688 --> 00:33:10,889
He's on trial right now
for, like, a bunch of stuff.

784
00:33:10,890 --> 00:33:12,925
Oh, yeah? Yeah,
I heard about that.

785
00:33:12,926 --> 00:33:14,893
Yeah, yeah. It's so crazy, man.

786
00:33:14,894 --> 00:33:16,195
You think you know a guy

787
00:33:16,196 --> 00:33:19,198
turns out to be a full, crazy
monster, man?

788
00:33:19,199 --> 00:33:19,832
Yeah, right.

789
00:33:19,833 --> 00:33:21,433
So what happened to you?

790
00:33:21,434 --> 00:33:23,102
What do you mean?

791
00:33:23,103 --> 00:33:24,470
Nothing.

792
00:33:24,471 --> 00:33:29,108
Not one thing.

793
00:33:29,109 --> 00:33:30,676
Let's wait for the next one.

794
00:33:30,677 --> 00:33:33,145
Yeah. Know
there's plenty of room in here.

795
00:33:33,146 --> 00:33:36,648
There's plenty of room
in this elevator.

796
00:33:36,649 --> 00:33:39,184
So Maya's

797
00:33:39,185 --> 00:33:41,286
that Jewish Protestant, actually.

798
00:33:41,287 --> 00:33:44,089
Protestant?
Yeah. Nice. Yeah. You know what?

799
00:33:44,090 --> 00:33:46,192
We should take a selfie
together. Come on. Oh, no.

800
00:33:49,295 --> 00:33:51,697
The elevators
are so slow sometimes.

801
00:33:51,698 --> 00:33:52,631
What was that?

802
00:33:52,632 --> 00:33:54,733
You must have hit stop
or something.

803
00:33:54,734 --> 00:33:55,701
I think we stuck.

804
00:33:55,702 --> 00:33:58,303
Man, we got to be here
for a while now. Oh, no.

805
00:33:58,304 --> 00:34:01,040
Should we, jump up and down
till something happens?

806
00:34:01,041 --> 00:34:05,210
Nah, man,
I don't like doing crazy stuff.

807
00:34:05,211 --> 00:34:06,345
You don't understand.

808
00:34:06,346 --> 00:34:08,480
I get really claustrophobic.

809
00:34:08,481 --> 00:34:10,315
Oh, trust me, I understand.

810
00:34:10,316 --> 00:34:14,219
I'm a few phobias myself.

811
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:17,923
But right now,
we just need to relax.

812
00:34:17,924 --> 00:34:19,792
You want some knots? No.

813
00:34:19,793 --> 00:34:22,094
I'm good.
I just got to get out of here.

814

I gotta calm down, Mike.

It's a love song, okay?

Colin Jost.

908
00:38:16,663 --> 00:38:19,231
Well, President Trump traveled
to the Middle East this week,

909
00:38:19,232 --> 00:38:20,133
and if I were him,

910
00:38:20,433 --> 00:38:23,168
I would have just stayed there
because it looked awesome.

911
00:38:23,169 --> 00:38:24,770
Trump arrived in Saudi Arabia

912
00:38:24,771 --> 00:38:25,605
where he was greeted

913
00:38:26,039 --> 00:38:29,441
with a lavender carpet which
matched the color of his tie

914
00:38:29,442 --> 00:38:32,845
and also the length.

915
00:38:32,846 --> 00:38:35,881
They also rolled out a mobile
McDonald's truck for President

916
00:38:35,882 --> 00:38:36,950
Trump's visit,

917
00:38:37,050 --> 00:38:39,885
featuring Saudi Arabia's
most popular new burger.

918
00:38:39,886 --> 00:38:42,922
The MC journalist.

919
00:38:44,891 --> 00:38:46,960
President Trump,
while on his trip, said

920
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:50,562
that Iran has sort of agreed
to terms for a nuclear deal.

921
00:38:50,563 --> 00:38:52,297
In the same way, Trump
has sort of agreed

922
00:38:52,298 --> 00:38:54,067
to uphold the Constitution.

923
00:38:54,968 --> 00:38:57,136
Many people
in Saudi Arabia were very happy

924
00:38:57,137 --> 00:38:59,071
with President Trump's
visit to the country,

925
00:38:59,072 --> 00:39:02,175
because rich Saudis
love to fly out thick blonds.

926
00:39:06,046 --> 00:39:08,080
The Democratic
National Committee protested

927
00:39:08,081 --> 00:39:09,181
President Trump's plans

928
00:39:09,182 --> 00:39:12,584
to accept a $400 million luxury
jet from Qatar

929
00:39:12,585 --> 00:39:16,656
by flying a banner over
Mar-A-Lago reading Qatar a Lago.

930
00:39:17,190 --> 00:39:20,225
It's the kind of hilarious stunt
that makes you realize

931
00:39:20,226 --> 00:39:23,263
why the Democrats
will never win again.

932
00:39:24,764 --> 00:39:27,099
Ethical experts are also warning
that Trump may owe

933
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:30,537
political favors to countries
who give him lavish gifts.

934
00:39:30,937 --> 00:39:32,905
But based on the way
he left the Middle East,

935
00:39:32,906 --> 00:39:35,942
I think I know how
Trump is going to pay them back.

936
00:39:43,950 --> 00:39:46,218
President Trump has signed
an executive order

937
00:39:46,219 --> 00:39:49,389
giving refugee status to
white people from South Africa.

938
00:39:50,357 --> 00:39:51,357
You know, I could have sworn

939
00:39:51,358 --> 00:39:53,692
that white people had it
good in South Africa.

940
00:39:53,693 --> 00:39:55,295
Must be the Mandela effect.

941
00:39:59,265 --> 00:40:00,666
The Trump
administration announced

942
00:40:00,667 --> 00:40:03,035
that after face
to face talks with China,

943
00:40:03,036 --> 00:40:06,373
it is lowering tariffs
from 145% to 30%,

944
00:40:06,573 --> 00:40:09,576
which is a little like bragging
about taking the knife out.

945
00:40:14,781 --> 00:40:16,749
Robert F Kennedy Jr,

946
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:19,786
whose shirt collar traps
all the blood in his head,

947
00:40:21,654 --> 00:40:24,123
was criticized
for posting pictures of himself

948
00:40:24,124 --> 00:40:27,760
swimming in a Washington,
DC, creek despite signs

949
00:40:27,761 --> 00:40:30,829
warning it was contaminated
with raw sewage.

950
00:40:30,830 --> 00:40:33,632
Oh, can you imagine
how many parasites are in there?

951
00:40:33,633 --> 00:40:36,670
Said the Creek.

952
00:40:36,936 --> 00:40:38,537
The Department of Homeland
Security

953
00:40:38,538 --> 00:40:41,607
said they may participate
in a new reality show

954
00:40:41,608 --> 00:40:43,575
in which immigrants
would go through a series

955
00:40:43,576 --> 00:40:46,178
of challenges for a chance
to become a citizen.

956
00:40:46,179 --> 00:40:49,182
It's called the real
housekeepers of Orange County.

957
00:40:54,954 --> 00:40:57,623
According to an

958
00:40:57,624 --> 00:41:00,592
according to a new tell
all book, Biden's inner circle

959
00:41:00,593 --> 00:41:01,961
revealed that they were worried

960
00:41:02,062 --> 00:41:04,964
the president would need
a wheelchair in his second term,

961
00:41:05,165 --> 00:41:08,234
especially after they were all
done stabbing him in the back.

962
00:41:11,538 --> 00:41:14,073
The white House also announced
that Vice President J.D.

963
00:41:14,074 --> 00:41:18,645
Vance will travel to the Vatican
for Pope Leo's inaugural mass.

964
00:41:19,079 --> 00:41:22,082
And I'm not a huge
fan of his outfit.

965
00:41:24,617 --> 00:41:27,353
Train engineers went on strike
yesterday, completely

966
00:41:27,354 --> 00:41:30,122
shutting down new Jersey
transit lines into New York.

967
00:41:30,123 --> 00:41:33,159
In case you were wondering
why the city smelled so nice.

968
00:41:37,864 --> 00:41:38,764
In what counts

969
00:41:38,765 --> 00:41:42,202
as good news in 2025,
the Menendez brothers

970
00:41:43,436 --> 00:41:46,105
have been resentenced
for the 1989 murder

971
00:41:46,106 --> 00:41:46,939
of their parents

972
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:48,107
after the judge said

973
00:41:48,108 --> 00:41:51,411
he did not believe the brothers
posed a risk if released,

974
00:41:51,745 --> 00:41:54,748
unless someone adopts them.

975
00:41:55,181 --> 00:41:57,683
That's a good point.

976
00:41:57,684 --> 00:41:59,518
At this point,

977
00:41:59,519 --> 00:42:00,285
I joked.

978
00:42:00,286 --> 00:42:02,054
After several
troubling incidents

979
00:42:02,055 --> 00:42:03,822
at Newark
Liberty International Airport.

980
00:42:03,823 --> 00:42:06,325
Many people are worried
about airplane safety,

981
00:42:06,326 --> 00:42:09,729
but one person is more worried
about airplane food.

982
00:42:10,063 --> 00:42:10,964
Here to comment.

983
00:42:11,064 --> 00:42:11,965
You know her.

984
00:42:12,065 --> 00:42:12,931
You love her.

985
00:42:12,932 --> 00:42:15,534

986

988

I'm sorry.

989
00:42:30,250 --> 00:42:30,916
What is. This?

990
00:42:30,917 --> 00:42:33,352
Down this flight stack.

991
00:42:33,353 --> 00:42:35,688
And I ain't even served
the food yet.

992
00:42:35,689 --> 00:42:37,489
Flight attendant came around
asking me

993
00:42:37,490 --> 00:42:40,559
if I want some butternut squash
ravioli.

994
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:42,528
More like, but not offer me
that.

995
00:42:42,529 --> 00:42:44,830
Mister, you put some meat in it.

996
00:42:44,831 --> 00:42:47,833
Squash that sucker.

997
00:42:47,834 --> 00:42:49,868
Can't even give me a whole
can of soda.

998
00:42:49,869 --> 00:42:51,570
Stingy.

999
00:42:51,571 --> 00:42:54,306
Want to hand me a dry ass
Biscoff?

1000
00:42:54,307 --> 00:42:57,344
More like
you got to piss off Biscoff.

1001
00:42:59,245 --> 00:43:00,045
I'm sorry.

1002
00:43:00,046 --> 00:43:02,247
Is all of your stand
up about food?

1003
00:43:02,248 --> 00:43:04,049
God damn.

1004
00:43:04,050 --> 00:43:05,551
I am starving.

1005
00:43:05,552 --> 00:43:07,920
Flight attendant saying
the only sandwich they got on

1006
00:43:07,921 --> 00:43:09,588
this plane is a turkey pesto.

1007
00:43:09,589 --> 00:43:11,056
Auch a bother.

1008
00:43:11,057 --> 00:43:12,591
All I know is this bitch about.

1009
00:43:12,592 --> 00:43:15,595
To lose her life

1010
00:43:15,962 --> 00:43:17,496
that rat was harder than my man.

1011
00:43:17,497 --> 00:43:18,732
When I get out the tub.

1012
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:23,102
His name's
Maurice, but I call him Trey

1013
00:43:23,103 --> 00:43:26,139
because he stay in the upright
and lock position.

1014
00:43:27,540 --> 00:43:27,873
Cousin.

1015
00:43:27,874 --> 00:43:29,842
His ex-wife.

1016
00:43:29,843 --> 00:43:32,311
That's right. Play.

1017
00:43:32,312 --> 00:43:33,212
Yeah. I'm sorry.

1018
00:43:33,213 --> 00:43:34,713
I really don't think this is
helpful.

1019
00:43:34,714 --> 00:43:35,914
Come in. Please.

1020
00:43:35,915 --> 00:43:39,284
I'm eating that. She asking?

1021
00:43:39,285 --> 00:43:42,422
Do I want some apple
cranberry compote?

1022
00:43:43,289 --> 00:43:44,790
I'ma need a computer to Google.

1023
00:43:44,791 --> 00:43:47,827
What the hell that is?

1024
00:43:50,997 --> 00:43:52,798
Hey, y'all went
into peanuts off the.

1025
00:43:52,799 --> 00:43:55,901
Plane because everybody
want to have an allergy.

1026
00:43:55,902 --> 00:43:57,836
If you don't take a Benadryl
and shut your.

1027
00:43:57,837 --> 00:44:00,372
Gas up,

1028
00:44:00,373 --> 00:44:02,474
the hell?

1029
00:44:02,475 --> 00:44:02,942
This.

1030
00:44:03,209 --> 00:44:05,244
This Newark story is serious.

1031
00:44:05,245 --> 00:44:07,913
And how bout that, TSA,

1032
00:44:07,914 --> 00:44:10,082
Putting on that Papa Smurf
gloves, thinking

1033
00:44:10,083 --> 00:44:11,050
they can fill me up.

1034
00:44:11,051 --> 00:44:14,054
Just because I got a God.

1035
00:44:14,954 --> 00:44:16,121
Complex empty stack.

1036
00:44:16,122 --> 00:44:19,091
What? That's right.

1037
00:44:19,092 --> 00:44:21,393
Stretch, y'all.

1038
00:44:21,394 --> 00:44:24,430
You are supposed to be talking
about Newark Airport.

1039
00:44:24,431 --> 00:44:27,434
I literally am listening here.

1040
00:44:29,269 --> 00:44:30,069
Menopause.

1041
00:44:30,070 --> 00:44:31,070
Been making me whole.

1042
00:44:31,071 --> 00:44:32,371
Menopause?

1043
00:44:32,372 --> 00:44:35,074
Well.

1044
00:44:35,075 --> 00:44:37,810
Let's just say, Miss Egg,
you don't need no hollandaise

1045
00:44:37,811 --> 00:44:39,211
sauce
because I already know how to.

1046
00:44:39,212 --> 00:44:42,248
Benedict.

1047
00:44:43,516 --> 00:44:46,418
Okay, here you go.

1048
00:44:46,419 --> 00:44:48,087
Please. There you go. Not.

1049
00:44:48,088 --> 00:44:51,190
Please wrap this up.
No collusion.

1050
00:44:51,191 --> 00:44:54,227
Thank you, JetBlue,
for having a bitch.

1051
00:44:54,794 --> 00:44:57,763
And if we hit turbulence, Colin,
just take a Benadryl.

1052
00:44:57,764 --> 00:44:58,797
And what?

1053
00:44:58,798 --> 00:45:01,835
Shut your gas up.

1054
00:45:03,670 --> 00:45:04,870
Enjoy the flight.

1055
00:45:04,871 --> 00:45:07,874
Mrs...

1056
00:45:16,516 --> 00:45:17,250
New research

1057
00:45:17,617 --> 00:45:20,319
shows that too much sitting
could damage your brain.

1058
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:23,356
Which explains why Stephen
Hawking was such a dumb ass.

1059
00:45:29,062 --> 00:45:30,462
Dick's Sporting Goods announced

1060
00:45:30,463 --> 00:45:34,066
that it is buying Foot Locker
for more than $2 billion,

1061
00:45:34,067 --> 00:45:37,070
and will combine to form
Dick Soccer's.

1062
00:45:39,572 --> 00:45:40,739
Annual survey found

1063
00:45:40,740 --> 00:45:44,443
that the worst livers in New
York City are men from the Bronx

1064
00:45:44,444 --> 00:45:46,278
and Queens,
while women from the Bronx

1065
00:45:46,279 --> 00:45:49,082
and Queens safely keep
all their junk in the trunk.

1066
00:45:54,354 --> 00:45:58,090
A driver for Amazon was fired
after she was caught on a ring

1067
00:45:58,091 --> 00:46:01,694
camera defecating on a porch,
said the homeowner.

1068
00:46:01,695 --> 00:46:04,731
But that's what I ordered.

1069
00:46:05,532 --> 00:46:07,666
A new study suggests
that people who feel tired

1070
00:46:07,667 --> 00:46:08,434
all the time

1071
00:46:08,435 --> 00:46:10,069
could have suffered
a mini stroke,

1072
00:46:10,070 --> 00:46:12,237
which makes sense
because I always get sleepy

1073
00:46:12,238 --> 00:46:13,105
after a stroke.

1074
00:46:13,106 --> 00:46:16,142
Know?

1075
00:46:18,311 --> 00:46:21,314
I don't take time.

1076
00:46:22,148 --> 00:46:23,916
It was a heartwarming
one to end on.

1077
00:46:23,917 --> 00:46:28,288
You know, tonight is our season
finale, and we, I'm not sure

1078
00:46:29,356 --> 00:46:32,057
your last joke
took my breath away.

1079
00:46:32,058 --> 00:46:33,559
And we have a tradition here.

1080
00:46:33,560 --> 00:46:34,760
We're gonna give each other

1081
00:46:34,761 --> 00:46:39,164
joke Street
at the end of the season.

1082
00:46:39,165 --> 00:46:41,800
Yeah, we're making each other
three.

1083
00:46:41,801 --> 00:46:45,771
Jokes live on air that the other
person has never seen before.

1084
00:46:45,772 --> 00:46:50,876
But before we start,
it's SNL 50th season.

1085
00:46:50,877 --> 00:46:53,879
So I want to take a moment
to say something to our boss,

1086
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:55,081
Lorne Michaels.

1087
00:46:56,383 --> 00:46:59,386
Lorne retire bitch.

1088
00:47:01,454 --> 00:47:04,757
Let me run the show.

1089
00:47:04,758 --> 00:47:06,625
Wow. Out the gate, Colin.

1090
00:47:06,626 --> 00:47:09,061
Well, maybe I should just
tell you the first joke.

1091
00:47:09,062 --> 00:47:09,728
How about that?

1092
00:47:09,729 --> 00:47:11,330
Oh, I get to do another.

1093
00:47:11,331 --> 00:47:13,832
Yeah, yeah,
it's all a joke, man.

1094
00:47:13,833 --> 00:47:16,602
CBS has premiered
the first hour long

1095
00:47:16,603 --> 00:47:20,806
daytime soap opera
with a predominantly black cast.

1096
00:47:20,807 --> 00:47:25,044
It'll air when black people
are home from work 24 hours.

1097
00:47:25,045 --> 00:47:28,081
The ticket.

1098
00:47:33,420 --> 00:47:35,955
Since you like that,

1099
00:47:36,056 --> 00:47:38,057
here's another.

1100
00:47:38,058 --> 00:47:40,859
CBS has premiered
the first half hour

1101
00:47:40,860 --> 00:47:45,064
long daytime soap opera
with a predominantly black cast.

1102
00:47:45,065 --> 00:47:48,067
It's called All My Children
don't know

1103
00:47:48,068 --> 00:47:51,071
who their daddy.

1104
00:47:54,607 --> 00:47:54,974
Movie

1105
00:47:55,709 --> 00:47:57,543
theaters are trying
to stop teenagers from screaming

1106
00:47:57,544 --> 00:48:00,145
and throwing popcorn
during the Minecraft scene

1107
00:48:00,146 --> 00:48:02,014
with the chicken jockey,

1108
00:48:02,015 --> 00:48:06,685
because some of us
are trying to masturbate.

1109
00:48:06,686 --> 00:48:09,121
But seriously,
Minecraft was a great movie.

1110
00:48:09,122 --> 00:48:13,058
I haven't been that excited
since I saw a white woman

1111
00:48:13,059 --> 00:48:14,394
drink unattended.

1112
00:48:20,633 --> 00:48:25,070
It's so exciting for you!

1113
00:48:25,071 --> 00:48:25,604
I wonder,

1114
00:48:25,605 --> 00:48:29,475
oh man, why isn't this

1115
00:48:29,476 --> 00:48:30,409
a new. Yeah, it could be.

1116
00:48:30,410 --> 00:48:32,311
And it could be nice. Yeah.

1117
00:48:32,312 --> 00:48:35,748
A new study finds that the hoots
and grunts of bonobos

1118
00:48:35,749 --> 00:48:40,252
show signs of complex thoughts
similar to human language.

1119
00:48:40,253 --> 00:48:43,289
Oh. So like that awful
halftime show.

1120
00:48:51,765 --> 00:48:53,399
You know,
before I tell another joke, I.

1121
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:56,568
Want to take this opportunity
to apologize to someone I hurt.

1122
00:48:56,569 --> 00:48:59,606
Scarlett, can you come out here?

1123
00:49:04,577 --> 00:49:05,811
Oh, I just, you know, last.

1124
00:49:05,812 --> 00:49:07,513
Time we did jokes, I made Colin

1125
00:49:07,514 --> 00:49:11,517
do some tasteless jokes
comparing your vagina to Costco.

1126
00:49:11,518 --> 00:49:13,920
Roast beef?

1127
00:49:14,020 --> 00:49:15,922
Yes, I remember that.

1128
00:49:16,022 --> 00:49:20,426
Well, the fact is, I was just
lashing out because I'm jealous.

1129
00:49:20,427 --> 00:49:25,064
I've never even seen
a human vagina.

1130
00:49:25,065 --> 00:49:28,167
And notice I said human

1131
00:49:28,168 --> 00:49:31,470
because I
once spent the summer on a farm.

1132
00:49:31,471 --> 00:49:35,140
You found me.

1133
00:49:35,141 --> 00:49:37,376
Maybe I'm just embarrassed
about my own body.

1134
00:49:37,377 --> 00:49:39,345
I can't even take my hoodie off
during sex

1135
00:49:39,346 --> 00:49:44,083
because I have more nipples
than a pregnant dog.

1136
00:49:44,084 --> 00:49:45,451
Yes, I have heard that about.

1137
00:49:45,452 --> 00:49:46,452
You and Colin.

1138
00:49:46,453 --> 00:49:51,056
I'm sorry too, because I owe you
everything. Oh,

1139
00:49:51,057 --> 00:49:53,359
when Colin discovered me,
I was selling

1140
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:57,129
crack outside the.

1141
00:49:57,130 --> 00:49:58,764
And now look at me selling crack

1142
00:49:58,765 --> 00:50:02,835
outside the American Girl doll.

1143
00:50:02,836 --> 00:50:04,870
I'm so thousands of jokes
for an update

1144
00:50:04,871 --> 00:50:07,940
and gotten dozens of laughs.

1145
00:50:07,941 --> 00:50:12,011
But I've never said the three
most important words of all.

1146
00:50:12,012 --> 00:50:15,314
I love you.

1147
00:50:15,315 --> 00:50:20,052
Oh, on.

1148
00:50:20,053 --> 00:50:21,120
Truth.

1149
00:50:21,121 --> 00:50:23,922
I love you too. Oh. Well.

1150
00:50:23,923 --> 00:50:25,391
Yeah.

1151
00:50:25,392 --> 00:50:26,925
Okay.

1152
00:50:26,926 --> 00:50:28,761
Before I continue.

1153
00:50:28,762 --> 00:50:32,131
Golden State Warriors
head coach Steve Kerr

1154
00:50:32,132 --> 00:50:35,067
is here with his family.

1155
00:50:35,068 --> 00:50:39,371
I got to meet his son,
Nick, and I love Steve.

1156
00:50:39,372 --> 00:50:42,641
I like Nick.

1157
00:50:42,642 --> 00:50:44,076
But I wouldn't say I'm

1158
00:50:44,077 --> 00:50:47,113
a Nick Kerr lover.

1159
00:50:56,523 --> 00:51:03,062
Besides, the Hollywood star.

1160
00:51:03,063 --> 00:51:05,564
Some psychologists say adults

1161
00:51:05,565 --> 00:51:09,668
can reduce stress by returning
to a childhood hobby.

1162
00:51:09,669 --> 00:51:13,305
Which is why I returned
to my favorite childhood hobby

1163
00:51:13,306 --> 00:51:16,343
topping off priests
with my pretty little mouth.

1164
00:51:22,315 --> 00:51:25,318
Speaking of which.

1165
00:51:41,568 --> 00:51:42,368
Lawn.

1166
00:51:42,369 --> 00:51:43,602
I'll do anything.

1167
00:51:43,603 --> 00:51:46,639
To run this show

1168
00:51:48,508 --> 00:51:54,314
For Weekend Update
I|m Michael Che I|m Colin Jost
Goodnight

1169
00:52:06,860 --> 00:52:07,760
All right, everyone,

1170
00:52:07,761 --> 00:52:10,896
welcome to day
one of shooting Penelope.

1171
00:52:10,897 --> 00:52:13,232
Secret. Yes.

1172
00:52:13,233 --> 00:52:16,669
It's a romance
about two women in the 50s

1173
00:52:16,670 --> 00:52:18,737
who fall deeply in love.

1174
00:52:18,738 --> 00:52:20,773
And, yes, I'm the director.

1175
00:52:20,774 --> 00:52:23,075
And yes, I am a man.

1176
00:52:23,076 --> 00:52:28,347
So we, Why don't I throw
to our assistant director who.

1177
00:52:28,348 --> 00:52:30,582
And this will make you all feel
better.

1178
00:52:30,583 --> 00:52:31,985
Is a woman.

1179
00:52:32,085 --> 00:52:35,421
Yay, woman. Thanks, Greg.

1180
00:52:35,422 --> 00:52:36,990
Actually, I'm non-binary.

1181
00:52:37,090 --> 00:52:40,092
Oops. Sorry.

1182
00:52:40,093 --> 00:52:42,561
Okay, so our first scene up
today will be the one where

1183
00:52:42,562 --> 00:52:45,731
Penelope and Madame Wilcox
first become intimate.

1184
00:52:45,732 --> 00:52:48,767
And to make sure everyone
feels safe and comfortable,

1185
00:52:48,768 --> 00:52:51,537
we've brought in two intimacy
coordinators.

1186
00:52:51,538 --> 00:52:53,772
Guys,
want to introduce yourselves?

1187
00:52:53,773 --> 00:52:55,774
Yeah. Hi, everyone. I'm Trish.

1188
00:52:55,775 --> 00:52:57,576
And this is an insane
coincidence,

1189
00:52:57,577 --> 00:53:01,747
but my name is also Madame
Wilcox.

1190
00:53:01,748 --> 00:53:03,349
Well,
thanks for being here, you guys.

1191
00:53:03,350 --> 00:53:04,516
Thanks for having us.

1192
00:53:04,517 --> 00:53:07,252
Now, where is our cast?
Right over here.

1193
00:53:07,253 --> 00:53:10,489
This is Annabel,
and this is Rachel.

1194
00:53:10,490 --> 00:53:11,790
Great to meet you.

1195
00:53:11,791 --> 00:53:14,860
So where's the dude?

1196
00:53:14,861 --> 00:53:16,628
Oh, there's no dude.

1197
00:53:16,629 --> 00:53:18,063
Just the two women.

1198
00:53:18,064 --> 00:53:18,431
Yeah.

1199
00:53:19,065 --> 00:53:21,200
Okay, so it's just a kissing
scene, right? Right.

1200
00:53:21,201 --> 00:53:22,634
That's great.

1201
00:53:22,635 --> 00:53:27,406
No, guys, it's a full love scene
between two women.

1202
00:53:27,407 --> 00:53:33,145
But how would that even work?

1203
00:53:33,146 --> 00:53:34,313
What do you mean?

1204
00:53:34,314 --> 00:53:34,780
Oh, no.

1205
00:53:34,781 --> 00:53:35,814
He's just confused

1206
00:53:35,815 --> 00:53:39,651
because he doesn't get
how two buns make a hot dog.

1207
00:53:39,652 --> 00:53:41,086
I get it, I love it.

1208
00:53:41,087 --> 00:53:44,456
But wait, like, two donuts isn't
exactly a balanced breakfast.

1209
00:53:44,457 --> 00:53:48,627
It's simply too much tunnel,
not enough train.

1210
00:53:48,628 --> 00:53:49,562
Okay.

1211
00:53:49,896 --> 00:53:53,699
I'm sorry, have you guys never
worked on a queer set before?

1212
00:53:53,700 --> 00:53:58,170
Or as us allies
like to call it, an overdue set?

1213
00:53:58,171 --> 00:54:01,640
Am I right? Yeah. Okay. Okay.

1214
00:54:01,641 --> 00:54:02,841
Just get it together.

1215
00:54:02,842 --> 00:54:03,776
Whoops. I'm sorry.

1216
00:54:03,777 --> 00:54:05,744
Yeah. Of course. We've worked on
queer sets.

1217
00:54:05,745 --> 00:54:09,782
I mean,
I myself am ally passing.

1218
00:54:09,783 --> 00:54:12,317
But it's
different for girls, right?

1219
00:54:12,318 --> 00:54:17,089
Like gay guys, I get a
but it's basically of a dude.

1220
00:54:17,090 --> 00:54:18,323
I'm sorry.

1221
00:54:18,324 --> 00:54:21,326
Do you think lesbians don't
have sex?

1222
00:54:21,327 --> 00:54:24,196
Oh, well, I hope this isn't
offensive, but real sex.

1223
00:54:24,197 --> 00:54:25,864
No, no I don't.

1224
00:54:25,865 --> 00:54:26,232
You know what?

1225
00:54:26,766 --> 00:54:28,067
He's just having trouble
understanding

1226
00:54:28,068 --> 00:54:32,371
how you'd pay without putting
a credit card in a reader. Oh.

1227
00:54:32,372 --> 00:54:35,408
Is it like Apple Pay
where you just tap the Googles?

1228
00:54:37,377 --> 00:54:38,110
Sorry, dude.

1229
00:54:38,111 --> 00:54:39,845
The Googles.

1230
00:54:39,846 --> 00:54:41,413
Seriously? My guy.

1231
00:54:41,414 --> 00:54:45,851
This is highly offensive
to lesbian folks.

1232
00:54:45,852 --> 00:54:48,787
Actually,
that's not totally wrong.

1233
00:54:48,788 --> 00:54:52,458
Oh, she's so annoying, dude.

1234
00:54:52,459 --> 00:54:53,292
Sorry.

1235
00:54:53,293 --> 00:54:56,161
They are so annoying.

1236
00:54:56,162 --> 00:54:56,929
You know what?

1237
00:54:56,930 --> 00:54:59,498
Maybe
just try to picture it. But.

1238
00:54:59,499 --> 00:55:03,135
Guess I could give it a shot.

1239
00:55:03,136 --> 00:55:12,077
Oh. Well, that is nice.

1240
00:55:12,078 --> 00:55:15,314
You know, perhaps there's
some online videos of two ladies

1241
00:55:15,315 --> 00:55:17,282
that I could watch
as further research.

1242
00:55:17,283 --> 00:55:19,953
Yeah, I think I'm gonna go
watch some videos of two ladies

1243
00:55:20,053 --> 00:55:23,522
right now.

1244
00:55:23,523 --> 00:55:24,958
Wow. Okay.

1245
00:55:25,058 --> 00:55:28,527
He was
in a hurry with the weather.

1246
00:55:28,528 --> 00:55:29,728
Wait, what's the weather.
What's the weather.

1247
00:55:29,729 --> 00:55:31,497
What's the website.
What's the weather.

1248
00:55:31,498 --> 00:55:34,133
App. Yeah okay

1249
00:55:34,134 --> 00:55:36,168
guys we got to get going here.

1250
00:55:36,169 --> 00:55:38,537
Can we move on with the scene?
You know what?

1251
00:55:38,538 --> 00:55:40,472
Let's just do it,

1252
00:55:40,473 --> 00:55:42,509
Hooray

1253
00:55:56,723 --> 00:55:57,523
What's up man?

1254
00:55:57,524 --> 00:55:58,657
This is TV tech.

1255
00:55:58,658 --> 00:56:01,694
We talked to your favorite cast
from your favorite show.

1256
00:56:01,695 --> 00:56:03,028
Yeah, and we're so excited.

1257
00:56:03,029 --> 00:56:05,564
This was our most requested
show this year.

1258
00:56:05,565 --> 00:56:07,333
Joining us
today is the cast of the hit

1259
00:56:07,334 --> 00:56:10,337
romance Summer Lake. Hey.

1260
00:56:11,171 --> 00:56:12,304
Thanks for being here, guys.

1261
00:56:12,305 --> 00:56:14,773
We've got a ton of questions
for the whole cast.

1262
00:56:14,774 --> 00:56:16,909
There's so much for
the fans are dying to know.

1263
00:56:16,910 --> 00:56:17,876
But we're going to start

1264
00:56:17,877 --> 00:56:20,746
with the internet's boyfriend,
Danny Cheeks.

1265
00:56:20,747 --> 00:56:23,783
Oh. Hey, guys, it's me.

1266
00:56:24,617 --> 00:56:26,085
So, Danny,
first question is for you.

1267
00:56:26,086 --> 00:56:29,054
Your character is always wearing
his signature hoodies.

1268
00:56:29,055 --> 00:56:31,457
Were those
from your real closet?

1269
00:56:31,458 --> 00:56:34,761
No. I wish, but the wardrobe
department knew what was up.

1270
00:56:35,195 --> 00:56:36,628
They really did.
And next question.

1271
00:56:36,629 --> 00:56:38,530
Danny,
how did you get into acting?

1272
00:56:38,531 --> 00:56:41,167
Well, I love watching
TV, so I wanted to try it.

1273
00:56:43,236 --> 00:56:45,070
And our next
question is for you, Rochelle.

1274
00:56:45,071 --> 00:56:47,773
What's harder
being a woman or being black?

1275
00:56:47,774 --> 00:56:50,843
Oh, that's my question.

1276
00:56:50,844 --> 00:56:52,745
Yeah. So let's go back to Danny.

1277
00:56:52,746 --> 00:56:54,813
Was it fun shooting at the lake?

1278
00:56:54,814 --> 00:56:57,950
Oh, it was fun, but it was hot.

1279
00:56:57,951 --> 00:56:59,218
Yeah. Low hot.

1280
00:56:59,219 --> 00:57:02,255
And, Jade, when's the last time
you took plan B?

1281
00:57:02,589 --> 00:57:05,024
Whoa. Don't ask that.

1282
00:57:05,025 --> 00:57:08,628
Okay, so, Danny, do you have
a favorite on set snack?

1283
00:57:09,029 --> 00:57:11,563
Oh, man. That's hard.

1284
00:57:11,564 --> 00:57:13,565
Maybe pretzels.

1285
00:57:13,566 --> 00:57:15,701
Ooh. Nice. Salty.

1286
00:57:15,702 --> 00:57:16,735
And now, Kasey,

1287
00:57:16,736 --> 00:57:19,739
you're not as attractive
as the other cast members.

1288
00:57:20,674 --> 00:57:23,208
That's not a question.

1289
00:57:23,209 --> 00:57:24,443
It's what the fans are saying.

1290
00:57:24,444 --> 00:57:27,079
So, Danny,
who are you dating these days?

1291
00:57:27,080 --> 00:57:29,114
Oh, I don't kiss and tell.

1292
00:57:29,115 --> 00:57:30,516
Of course, that's private.

1293
00:57:30,517 --> 00:57:32,952
So, Taylor, you just had
a really bad divorce.

1294
00:57:33,053 --> 00:57:35,155
Whose fault was
it? You or your husband's?

1295
00:57:36,556 --> 00:57:39,358
It was
a girl, and it was my fault.

1296
00:57:39,359 --> 00:57:41,126
Oh, wait.

1297
00:57:41,127 --> 00:57:43,362
Danny, is it fun having abs?

1298
00:57:43,363 --> 00:57:45,931
Yeah, I love it.

1299
00:57:45,932 --> 00:57:47,099
Why can't we get.

1300
00:57:47,100 --> 00:57:49,802
Questions like that?
Okay, Kasey, here's a fun one.

1301
00:57:49,803 --> 00:57:51,704
You recently got married.
Congrats.

1302
00:57:51,705 --> 00:57:54,741
So why isn't your husband
a Ukrainian refugees?

1303
00:57:54,941 --> 00:57:57,810
That was a fun one.

1304
00:57:57,811 --> 00:58:00,012
I had fun.

1305
00:58:00,013 --> 00:58:03,016
Danny, when's the last time
you laughed really hard.

1306
00:58:03,316 --> 00:58:06,018
Watching TikTok pranks?

1307
00:58:06,019 --> 00:58:07,219
Where shall we go to? You.

1308
00:58:07,220 --> 00:58:08,354
Deadline reported that you're

1309
00:58:08,355 --> 00:58:10,122
being written out of the show
next season.

1310
00:58:10,123 --> 00:58:12,926
Is it because someone leaked
your nudes?

1311
00:58:13,026 --> 00:58:16,029
I'm just learning about

1314
00:58:22,102 --> 00:58:23,702
Everything.

1315

1328

1334
00:59:05,011 --> 00:59:08,014
Yes. And,
Danny, music or pictures?

1335
00:59:08,248 --> 00:59:10,082
Music.

1336
00:59:10,083 --> 00:59:11,583
And finally, to all the women.

1337

1338

What do you. Mean?

1340
00:59:16,156 --> 00:59:17,122
Now, let me rephrase.

1341
00:59:17,123 --> 00:59:18,657
If a lesbian was raised in a lab

1342
00:59:18,658 --> 00:59:21,695
and never saw another person,
would she still dress like that?
