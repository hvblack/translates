1
00:00:02,075 --> 00:00:05,771
Trip

2
00:00:05,771 --> 00:00:07,845
alliances

3
00:00:07,845 --> 00:00:10,881
Both

4
00:00:10,881 --> 00:00:12,324
Powerful

5
00:00:12,324 --> 00:00:14,955
Love

6
00:00:18,006 --> 00:00:22,463
Mom, dad,
this is Crown
Prince Mohammed bin Salman.

7
00:00:22,463 --> 00:00:25,433
And we're together
now, getting off gorgeous.

8
00:00:25,433 --> 00:00:27,069
But we are vibing.

9
00:00:27,069 --> 00:00:29,679
- You are too kind.
- Habibi.

10
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:32,857
Habibi Habibi
What a word.

11
00:00:32,857 --> 00:00:35,764
But we've been having
a lot of fun in the Middle East.

12
00:00:35,764 --> 00:00:37,186
I've been having a great time.

13
00:00:37,186 --> 00:00:40,757
We've been eating a lot
of meals, sitting on the floor,

14
00:00:40,757 --> 00:00:45,348
dipping our fingers straight
into various groups and spreads

15
00:00:45,348 --> 00:00:47,502
that I politely scrape
under the rug

16
00:00:47,502 --> 00:00:51,523
and go eat at a mobile
McDonald's.
That you build for me
isn't that way.

17
00:00:52,157 --> 00:00:54,341
BA ba
ba ba ba ba. He's loving it.

18
00:00:54,341 --> 00:00:59,265
I, of course, am a big fan
of everything that Saudi Arabia has to offer,

19
00:00:59,265 --> 00:01:01,769
from the oil
to the money

20
00:01:01,769 --> 00:01:03,668
to end of list.

21
00:01:03,668 --> 00:01:08,280
But it's been a fantastic week
in the Middle East.

22
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:12,382
I also went to Qatar, the UAE

23
00:01:12,382 --> 00:01:16,580
and much like God did during
Passover, I skipped Israel.

24
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:17,751
Oh well,

25
00:01:17,751 --> 00:01:21,835
I bet you were happy about that
though.
You like that, right?

26
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:24,038
No comment.

27
00:01:24,038 --> 00:01:26,376
Don't comment.
You don't want to say anything.

28
00:01:26,376 --> 00:01:27,357
Cancel culture.

29
00:01:27,357 --> 00:01:31,543
But I did make this trip.
I didn't make this trip
for myself.

30
00:01:31,543 --> 00:01:35,230
I want to make that clear.
I did this
for the American people

31
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:39,647
and in many ways myself
by my personal enrichment.

32
00:01:39,647 --> 00:01:42,223
I did that too.
I did very well on this trip.

33
00:01:42,223 --> 00:01:44,466
Got a lot of cool stuff.

34
00:01:44,466 --> 00:01:49,058
The Qataris
gave me a $400 million plane.
Can you believe that?

35
00:01:49,058 --> 00:01:51,854
And people said
that was some sort of bribe.
Not true,

36
00:01:51,854 --> 00:01:55,917
not true because they haven't
asked for anything in return.

37
00:01:55,917 --> 00:01:58,364
Well, not yet.

38
00:01:58,364 --> 00:02:01,003
All right, so it's a pre bribe.
It's a pre bribe.

39
00:02:01,003 --> 00:02:05,977
But now people are saying
I should really be flying
in an American plane.

40
00:02:05,977 --> 00:02:07,326
No, thanks. Andy,

41
00:02:07,326 --> 00:02:10,628
have you seen
what's going on with our planes?

42
00:02:10,628 --> 00:02:13,902
The radar is down
and the screen is blank.

43
00:02:13,902 --> 00:02:15,209
Newark

44
00:02:15,849 --> 00:02:18,859
Darling, watch.
Where are we going?

45
00:02:18,859 --> 00:02:21,627
Where are we flying for
our vacation?

46
00:02:21,627 --> 00:02:23,848
I need directly into the ground.

47
00:02:23,848 --> 00:02:26,266
But we just made it big.
Oh shut up!

48
00:02:26,266 --> 00:02:30,001
But we just made a big airplane
deal with the Crown Prince.

49
00:02:30,001 --> 00:02:30,917
Tell them about it.

50
00:02:30,917 --> 00:02:36,557
Saudi Arabia will buy $1 billion
worth of aircraft from Boeing.

51
00:02:36,557 --> 00:02:38,061
Your funeral.

52
00:02:38,061 --> 00:02:42,772
I met with the leader of the UAE
in Abu Dhabi.

53
00:02:42,772 --> 00:02:44,872
We like to say Abu Dhabi.

54
00:02:44,872 --> 00:02:50,690
Abu Dhabi do like the
late great Fred Flintstone.

55
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:56,083
The UAE
promised to invest over $1
trillion in the US.

56
00:02:56,083 --> 00:03:00,879
I love Dubai because they Dubai
a lot of weapons.

57
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:03,923
But I've had a great trip
here in the Middle East.

58
00:03:03,923 --> 00:03:07,757
It was very much a boys trip.
I don't think
I saw a single woman.

59
00:03:07,757 --> 00:03:09,399
What's up with that,

60
00:03:09,399 --> 00:03:12,102
All the time Just walking into a room
full of boys.

61
00:03:12,174 --> 00:03:14,860
Hi, boys. Boys again?

62
00:03:14,969 --> 00:03:16,762
The women are all hiding.

63
00:03:16,763 --> 00:03:19,012
It's like a nation of Melania's.

64
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:21,667
Very funny.

65
00:03:21,667 --> 00:03:24,723
There it is.
Look at that baby. I'm
going to look that up.

66
00:03:24,723 --> 00:03:26,584
I'm cooking.
I'm having a great time.

67
00:03:26,584 --> 00:03:30,091
I was just going to say it.
I love the Arabs.
I love the Arabs.

68
00:03:30,091 --> 00:03:32,804
I don't want to go home.
Let me stay.

69
00:03:32,804 --> 00:03:37,153
Get me to Allah's country.
Everyone loves me here.

70
00:03:37,153 --> 00:03:39,067
They're not allowed to.

71
00:03:39,177 --> 00:03:42,776
They have to love you.
If not, bye bye.

72
00:03:42,776 --> 00:03:44,811
Inshallah.

73
00:03:44,811 --> 00:03:47,079
Oh, I love that.

74
00:03:47,079 --> 00:03:50,975
Donald. Please, stay.
They build a palace
next to mine and stay.

75
00:03:50,975 --> 00:03:54,490
Oh, I sadly, I can't.
I have to get back home.

76
00:03:54,490 --> 00:03:58,713
Luckily,
we have our own little slice
of Saudi Arabia in America.

77
00:03:58,713 --> 00:04:00,407
A dry
desert area

78
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:03,604
filled with people
who are way too
into their religion.

79
00:04:03,604 --> 00:04:05,514
We call ours UTAH

80
00:04:05,514 --> 00:04:10,081
and I do very well there,
so I can't stay here
in the Middle East.

81
00:04:10,081 --> 00:04:13,304
In fact,
you know what?
I can't even stay in this sketch
much long

82
00:04:13,304 --> 00:04:17,976
going. I have to leave. You know what?
Because it's the SNL
finale season 50.

83
00:04:17,976 --> 00:04:19,980
Worst one yet.

84
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:21,568
Okay. Get up.

85
00:04:21,568 --> 00:04:25,510
Go ahead, get up.
Get out of there.
Let me sit here. Yeah,
go with him.

86
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:28,438
Go eat
some chips in the hallway.

87
00:04:28,438 --> 00:04:31,790
I'm here
to break the fourth wall.

88
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:35,850
Oh, it's nice here
with all the young people.

89
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:37,658
Look at her. Wow.

90
00:04:37,658 --> 00:04:39,663
Seven zero

91
00:04:39,663 --> 00:04:41,982
sevens or more.
Sit on the floor.

92
00:04:41,982 --> 00:04:45,220
Six and below to the bleachers
you go.

93
00:04:47,635 --> 00:04:50,146
Get over it.
Over.

94
00:04:50,146 --> 00:04:52,759
It's like an Gutfeld joke.
Kind of rhymed, right?

95
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:56,009
But, you know,
since it's a finale,
that means after tonight,

96
00:04:56,009 --> 00:04:59,267
you won't be
seeing me here for a while. Oh.

97
00:04:59,267 --> 00:05:04,104
Oh, well,
not the fake fun version of me
that makes you smile.

98
00:05:04,104 --> 00:05:06,224
The real one
will still be omnipresent.

99
00:05:06,224 --> 00:05:08,868
You can't escape me, right?
I'm everywhere.

100
00:05:08,868 --> 00:05:11,282
Even in your dreams.
Even in your dreams.

101
00:05:11,282 --> 00:05:13,274
Like the late, great
Freddy Krueger.

102
00:05:13,389 --> 00:05:15,105
Supposed

103
00:05:15,105 --> 00:05:17,405
So see you again in the fall.

104
00:05:17,405 --> 00:05:19,906
If we still have a country, right.
It's a coin toss

105
00:05:19,906 --> 00:05:21,542
this summer,
everyone

106
00:05:21,542 --> 00:05:26,206
and live from New York.
It's Saturday Night

107
00:07:45,499 --> 00:07:50,939
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN-- SCARLETT
JOHANSSON!

108
00:08:08,206 --> 00:08:11,681
OH, THANK YOU, THANK YOU,
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

109
00:08:11,681 --> 00:08:16,943
I AM SO EXCITED TO BE HOSTING
THE FINALE OF SEASON 50.

110
00:08:18,626 --> 00:08:22,134
IT'S BEEN A HISTORIC SEASON.
I'M SO PROUD TO BE A PART OF IT.

111
00:08:22,134 --> 00:08:25,013
I FIRST HOSTED THIS SHOW WHEN I
WAS 21 YEARS OLD,

112
00:08:25,013 --> 00:08:28,921
SO IT'S CRAZY
TO BE BACK HERE LIKE WHAT, THREE
YEARS LATER.

113
00:08:28,921 --> 00:08:30,609
TIME REALLY FLIES.

114
00:08:30,609 --> 00:08:35,413

00:12:09,888 --> 00:12:13,940
It's channel four.
Wake up for the news

166
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:16,409
because
you're watching channel four.

167
00:12:16,409 --> 00:12:18,326
New York City News

168
00:12:18,326 --> 00:12:21,001
because it is channel four.

169
00:12:21,001 --> 00:12:23,952
It's channel four.

170
00:12:25,919 --> 00:12:28,115
That was our weather man, Keith.

171
00:12:28,115 --> 00:12:31,873
He said any one of the shot
to try something new
for our intro and. Well.

172
00:12:31,873 --> 00:12:33,724
Shot taken. Keith.

173
00:12:33,724 --> 00:12:36,625
Swing and a miss, folks.

174
00:12:36,936 --> 00:12:39,056
Good morning, New York.

175
00:12:39,056 --> 00:12:41,183
And thanks, as always,
for waking up with us.

176
00:12:41,183 --> 00:12:42,426
I'm Susan McGrath.

177
00:12:42,426 --> 00:12:44,951
I'm Tommy Nolan, our usual third
wheel.

178
00:12:44,951 --> 00:12:46,680
Claire Connors, is out today.

179
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,188
I can't legally say why,

180
00:12:48,188 --> 00:12:51,463
but let's just say
she gave birth to something.

181
00:12:51,463 --> 00:12:54,221
But filling in for her.
This morning,

182
00:12:54,221 --> 00:12:56,930
we have another member
of our channel four family,

183
00:12:56,930 --> 00:12:58,995
Denise Jones
from the Nightly News.

184
00:12:58,995 --> 00:13:00,852
So happy you're here.
Joining us, Denise.

185
00:13:00,852 --> 00:13:02,306
Thanks for having me.

186
00:13:02,306 --> 00:13:03,183
All right.

187
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:06,180
Let's get to our top stories
coming up later this morning.

188
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:07,828
It's a doggone miracle.

189
00:13:07,828 --> 00:13:12,289
A new layer of astroturf
has been installed
at the Riverside Dog Park.

190
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:17,847
And later
we tip our cap, a chino
to Little Bean coffee shop,

191
00:13:17,847 --> 00:13:21,640
which donates
all their leftover pastries
to a local homeless shelter.

192
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:25,515
Well, cap a chino,
and it's a doggone miracle.

193
00:13:25,515 --> 00:13:27,155
I love those little puns.

194
00:13:27,155 --> 00:13:31,231
Yeah,
they make our morning stories
a little extra fun
for our early risers.

195
00:13:31,231 --> 00:13:35,484
Well, that's so creative.
We don't usually do
those on the nightly news.

196
00:13:35,484 --> 00:13:39,638
All right, well,
you want to take the next one?
- Sure thing.

197
00:13:39,638 --> 00:13:41,949
Next up, the hospital.

198
00:13:41,949 --> 00:13:45,226
Last night, a woman
was assaulted on the train.

199
00:13:46,574 --> 00:13:49,243
I know, I did a pun.

200
00:13:50,086 --> 00:13:53,817
Well, Denise,
I just think that story
was a little too intense
for that.

201
00:13:53,817 --> 00:13:57,786
Oh, I get it.
You mean the pun is only okay
when it's something like this?

202
00:13:57,786 --> 00:14:00,572
Later,
we tip our cappuccino, know

203
00:14:00,573 --> 00:14:02,921
to the woman
who was assaulted on the train.

204
00:14:02,921 --> 00:14:04,913
Somehow worse.

205
00:14:04,913 --> 00:14:08,488
You know, why
don't we just focus
on the lighter stories, okay?

206
00:14:08,488 --> 00:14:11,329
Right.
Life is like a box
of chocolates.

207
00:14:11,329 --> 00:14:16,231
And Elmhurst
Candy store celebrates 100 years
in business.

208
00:14:16,231 --> 00:14:18,374
And I'll have what she's having.

209
00:14:18,374 --> 00:14:21,837
A Queens couple dies
in an apparent murder suicide.

210
00:14:21,837 --> 00:14:24,546
No. Wrong again.

211
00:14:24,546 --> 00:14:27,487
Denise, you don't have to do
the puns for the sad ones.

212
00:14:27,487 --> 00:14:30,117
Oh, okay. Got you. So,
like this.

213
00:14:30,117 --> 00:14:31,987
Take me to the river

214
00:14:31,987 --> 00:14:34,619
if you want to see the dead body
that washed up today.

215
00:14:34,619 --> 00:14:36,825
And coming up later this hour.

216
00:14:36,825 --> 00:14:39,039
Who took his dong out?

217
00:14:39,039 --> 00:14:41,385
An Ohio teacher did it.

218
00:14:41,385 --> 00:14:44,031
Didn't miss no more puns.

219
00:14:44,031 --> 00:14:45,684
Oh, I like doing them.

220
00:14:45,685 --> 00:14:47,676
We don't get to do them
at night.

221
00:14:47,676 --> 00:14:49,312
Oh, he ain't

222
00:14:49,312 --> 00:14:53,969
that woman. Stay tuned for the latest update
on the man over cannibal.

223
00:14:53,969 --> 00:14:56,182
You know what?
Why don't we throw it to weather

224
00:14:56,182 --> 00:14:59,488
so we can take a little break
from Denise over here.
Keith.

225
00:14:59,488 --> 00:15:02,591
Thanks, Susan.
This week
it's going to be sunny.

226
00:15:02,591 --> 00:15:04,590
Back to you, Denise.

227
00:15:05,048 --> 00:15:06,688
That was it.

228
00:15:06,688 --> 00:15:08,594
Thanks, Keith.

229
00:15:08,594 --> 00:15:11,576
And in national news,
after Lovisa baby,

230
00:15:11,576 --> 00:15:14,356
another infant
has been deported.

231
00:15:15,502 --> 00:15:19,356
Thankfully, we have a reporter
in the field standing by.

232
00:15:19,356 --> 00:15:21,253
Calvin,
how's it going out there?

233
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:23,509
Well, it's
a grim scene here at 11 time

234
00:15:23,509 --> 00:15:26,379
where I want my baby back.
Baby back, baby back.

235
00:15:26,379 --> 00:15:30,367
Says this mother of a girl
who was kidnaped from a Chili's.

236
00:15:30,367 --> 00:15:32,933
Calvin. No,

237
00:15:32,933 --> 00:15:35,244
this is serious.

238
00:15:35,244 --> 00:15:37,997
Sorry.
I just got inspired
by the niece.

239
00:15:37,997 --> 00:15:39,955
Thank you.

240
00:15:39,955 --> 00:15:44,480
It's just so refreshing
to finally see
a strong, intelligent
woman behind the desk

241
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:47,787
I've
Worked in for five years.

242
00:15:47,787 --> 00:15:49,771
Ooh. Can I try a pun, too?

243
00:15:49,872 --> 00:15:52,881
You used to call me on my cell
phone.

244
00:15:52,881 --> 00:15:57,545
It's been 12 days since I'm
in contact with my daughter.

245
00:15:58,356 --> 00:16:00,774
No.

246
00:16:00,774 --> 00:16:04,566
Well, much like I do every time I make
love to my beautiful wife,

247
00:16:04,566 --> 00:16:07,654
I think we have no choice
but to finish early.

248
00:16:07,654 --> 00:16:10,044
Sorry. That was weird.

249
00:16:10,044 --> 00:16:12,791
Why don't you take us home.
There, Keith?

250
00:16:12,791 --> 00:16:14,960
Good bye for now.

251
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:16,995
Channel four is over.

252
00:16:16,995 --> 00:16:20,314
Yes, the news is done.

253
00:16:30,538 --> 00:16:32,939

261
00:16:46,451 --> 00:16:48,841
HEY, KNOW WHAT YOU GUYS NEED?

00:24:51,424 --> 00:24:54,994
You're talking about it.

480
00:24:55,095 --> 00:24:55,828
Let me handle this.

481
00:24:55,829 --> 00:24:57,897
Okay?

482
00:25:35,335 --> 00:25:36,301
What are you laughing?

483
00:25:36,302 --> 00:25:39,138
What did you just say?

484
00:25:39,139 --> 00:25:41,940
I said,

485
00:25:41,941 --> 00:25:43,809
there's no reason to find.

486
00:25:43,810 --> 00:25:47,579
And they make, great couple.

487
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:52,084
And he never
he should never let her go. Oh.

488
00:25:52,085 --> 00:25:58,190
Oh. Really?

489
00:25:58,191 --> 00:26:00,025
That's sweet.

490
00:26:00,026 --> 00:26:03,930
Baby, let's get out of here
and go back to your place.

491
00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:06,166
Because tonight
I'm going to give you not.

492
00:26:10,503 --> 00:26:11,236
Okay, baby.

493
00:26:11,237 --> 00:26:12,705
Let's go.

494
00:26:12,706 --> 00:26:13,340
Okay.

495
00:26:13,873 --> 00:26:15,407
Well, maybe we can learn
a little something from them.

496
00:26:15,408 --> 00:26:16,041
So tonight

497
00:26:16,042 --> 00:26:17,243
I'm going to give you grab

498
00:26:22,849 --> 00:26:23,849
You have me.

499
00:26:23,850 --> 00:26:27,419
tetas

500
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:30,322
Wow. Wow.

501
00:26:30,323 --> 00:26:32,157
Would you look at that?

502
00:26:32,158 --> 00:26:34,527
It's like they always say I'm.

503
00:26:45,839 --> 00:26:48,856
So I just found out
there's a second Kansas City.

504
00:26:48,856 --> 00:26:51,554
Hey, you guys know
I love Colin, right?

505
00:26:51,554 --> 00:26:54,031
Of course.
He's your thing for life.

506
00:26:54,031 --> 00:26:56,546
Yeah. And we're, like,
totally happy.

507
00:26:56,546 --> 00:27:00,418
But, like, it's normal
to have little crushes here and there,

508
00:27:00,418 --> 00:27:03,695
especially
on someone from the cast.

509
00:27:03,695 --> 00:27:06,005
Who is that creepy?
Creepy Longfellow?

510
00:27:06,005 --> 00:27:07,525
No.

511
00:27:07,525 --> 00:27:10,040
It's Bowen

512
00:27:11,181 --> 00:27:13,448
This is just so sweet.

513
00:27:13,448 --> 00:27:15,783
And, I mean, nothing's obviously
going to happen.

514
00:27:15,783 --> 00:27:17,846
I'm married. He's gay.

515
00:27:17,846 --> 00:27:20,784
Yeah. No, Bowen is not gay.

516
00:27:20,784 --> 00:27:23,138
Bowen is straight as hell.

517
00:27:23,138 --> 00:27:26,014
Bowen Bowen Bowen

518
00:27:26,014 --> 00:27:29,792
Oh, really?
But at the 50th, I saw him
sobbing over Cher.

519
00:27:29,792 --> 00:27:33,342
It's all fake, girl.
He just styles up
the gay for clout.

520
00:27:33,342 --> 00:27:38,166
Trust me.
That man's a p hound through
and through. Ha!

521
00:27:40,375 --> 00:27:41,694
Seriously?

522
00:27:41,694 --> 00:27:44,001
Hello? Hello.

523
00:27:51,872 --> 00:27:54,463
Hey, I missed you.

524
00:27:54,463 --> 00:27:56,315
Of course he's with Gina
Gershon.

525
00:27:56,315 --> 00:27:58,079
We're just here to see,
you know,

526
00:27:58,079 --> 00:28:00,541
slower.
Okay.

527
00:28:01,125 --> 00:28:04,934
So how's the week been going?
You getting along with the cast?

528
00:28:04,934 --> 00:28:08,196
Yeah, fine.
Why? You heard something

529
00:28:08,583 --> 00:28:10,266
Oh, Bowen

530
00:28:10,266 --> 00:28:11,692
What's up? Colin?

531
00:28:11,692 --> 00:28:13,691
Hey. Could work
this season. Keep it up.

532
00:28:13,691 --> 00:28:16,013
- I'm excited to watch you
grow.
- Thanks, man.

533
00:28:16,013 --> 00:28:18,084
Do you mind?

534
00:28:18,084 --> 00:28:19,742
Leaving? Yeah,

535
00:28:19,742 --> 00:28:22,510
yeah. No problem.
Hey, let's take the stairs.

536
00:28:22,510 --> 00:28:24,807
It's only 30 flights.

537
00:28:26,179 --> 00:28:31,373
Scarlett.
Scarlett's my Jurassic harlot.

538
00:28:31,373 --> 00:28:32,293
Bowen

539
00:28:32,293 --> 00:28:35,385
We should be talking you
that way.
I'm married.

540
00:28:35,385 --> 00:28:38,384
Probably shouldn't
be doing a lot of things.

541
00:28:39,464 --> 00:28:40,958
It's better.

542
00:28:40,958 --> 00:28:44,188
Watch it. Mr.
Moo-Deng

543
00:28:44,188 --> 00:28:47,890
Listen,
you know Collins, my SNL brother

544
00:28:47,890 --> 00:28:50,709
and I never did
anything to hurt him back.

545
00:28:50,709 --> 00:28:53,511
I f his wife.

546
00:28:53,511 --> 00:28:56,711
There's something
I wanted to ask you.

547
00:28:56,711 --> 00:28:59,748
What? I guess I was wondering.

548
00:28:59,748 --> 00:29:03,056
What that yang do

549
00:29:08,150 --> 00:29:09,636
Scar

550
00:29:09,636 --> 00:29:11,741
We do. Need protection.

551
00:29:11,741 --> 00:29:14,940
No. It's fine.
I can bottom

552
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:25,002
I need to see you again tonight.

553
00:29:25,002 --> 00:29:27,669
I'll cook for you.
You can buy mine.

554
00:29:27,669 --> 00:29:29,406
Yeah.

555
00:29:29,406 --> 00:29:30,407
Think I might like to.

556
00:29:31,438 --> 00:29:34,506
Am going to wear something
pretty.

557
00:29:34,507 --> 00:29:38,610
Okay.

558
00:29:38,611 --> 00:29:45,851
Oh. Hi.

559
00:29:45,852 --> 00:29:49,054
Hey. We
hanging out tonight.

560
00:29:49,055 --> 00:29:49,688
Right?

561
00:29:49,689 --> 00:29:53,058
Should I come on in?

562
00:29:53,059 --> 00:29:54,893
Oh. Oh. Nice place.

563
00:29:54,894 --> 00:29:57,663
So, are we cooking?

564
00:29:57,664 --> 00:30:01,767
Hey. Hey, listen,
tendies in the air fryer.

565
00:30:01,768 --> 00:30:04,804
I can see it at rehearsal.

566
00:30:07,173 --> 00:30:08,741
You sleep with ego?

567
00:30:08,742 --> 00:30:10,109
What do you want me to say?

568
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:11,877
I don't. Know that
we had a connection.

569
00:30:11,878 --> 00:30:13,112
Oh, so now we're dating?

570
00:30:13,113 --> 00:30:15,514
I just found out who you were
this morning.

571
00:30:15,515 --> 00:30:16,348
Oh, Simon.

572
00:30:16,349 --> 00:30:20,719
Nothing to.
You got to suffocating me.

573
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:21,587
Screw it.

574
00:30:21,588 --> 00:30:24,390
I'm going
to Tokyo and inventing I.

575
00:30:24,391 --> 00:30:27,427
By the way.

576
00:30:29,562 --> 00:30:32,931
Hey, mama, I need you. To.

577
00:30:32,932 --> 00:30:34,733
You keep asking yourself why.

578
00:30:34,734 --> 00:30:36,201
You'll drive yourself crazy.

579
00:30:36,202 --> 00:30:38,871
I got gaslit by Bowen

580
00:30:38,872 --> 00:30:40,106
Yang

581
00:30:43,443 --> 00:30:44,977
Go to Disneyland Tokyo.

582
00:30:44,978 --> 00:30:47,212
Is that Emily Ratajkowski? Yeah.

583
00:30:47,213 --> 00:30:49,114
Okay, listen, I.

584
00:30:49,115 --> 00:30:51,216
Never get your back blown out
by a gay guy.

585
00:30:51,217 --> 00:30:55,355
Amen sister

586
00:31:09,541 --> 00:31:13,147
Hi.
Can you press 147, please?

587
00:31:13,147 --> 00:31:15,573
- Sure.
- Thank you.

588
00:31:15,573 --> 00:31:17,182
God.

589
00:31:17,182 --> 00:31:20,833
- Oh, you're Mike Myers
- Yes, I am. Yes.
Thank you.

590
00:31:23,388 --> 00:31:25,749
Dan, this is my staff.

591
00:31:25,749 --> 00:31:29,080
- Good to meet you, though.
- Nice to meet you.

592
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:32,234
Hi.
Sorry to bother you.
I just have to say this.

593
00:31:32,234 --> 00:31:34,401
I'm a huge fan of yours, Mr.
Meyers. Oh.

594
00:31:34,401 --> 00:31:36,469
Thank you. That's very,
very kind. Thank you.

595
00:31:36,469 --> 00:31:38,757
- And what's your name?
- I'm Janice,

596
00:31:38,774 --> 00:31:43,532
and I just love all your movies.
My girlfriends and I quote,
track, like, all the time. Oh.

597
00:31:43,573 --> 00:31:46,873
Thank you.
That's a little weird, but,
Thank you.
Thank you.

598
00:31:46,873 --> 00:31:48,548
It's my first time in New York.

599
00:31:48,548 --> 00:31:52,232
You just never know
what celebrity
you're going
to run into here.
- It's true.

600
00:31:52,316 --> 00:31:55,631
Oh, my God, is that Kanye West?

601
00:31:55,631 --> 00:31:59,602
Yeah.
What are you talking about
with my song?

602
00:31:59,602 --> 00:32:02,071
Come on,
give me one good reason.

603
00:32:02,071 --> 00:32:05,536
Besides that,
besides that.

604
00:32:05,536 --> 00:32:09,908
How is it not relatable?
Everybody got a cousin.

605
00:32:09,908 --> 00:32:12,361
Oh, I guess it's my SOP again.

606
00:32:12,361 --> 00:32:15,638
- So nice to meet you, Mr. Meyer.
- No, it is not. It is not your stuff.

607
00:32:15,638 --> 00:32:18,501
- What are you doing?
- You can't leave me alone in here
with him.

608
00:32:18,501 --> 00:32:21,128
Fine.
I heard he's doing.

609
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:25,894
Okay.
You might. Meyers. Right.

610
00:32:25,894 --> 00:32:27,981
Kanye. What's up man?

611
00:32:27,981 --> 00:32:30,384
It's just. Yay
now. Sorry, gay,

612
00:32:30,384 --> 00:32:32,557
- I guess it's been a while.
- Yeah.

613
00:32:32,557 --> 00:32:36,300
Since that Hurricane
Katrina benefit.
Yes.

614
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:41,604
You know, when I told the world
that George Bush don't care
about black people on live TV.
- Yes.

615
00:32:41,604 --> 00:32:45,758
And you just had to
stand there looking stupid?
- Yes.

616
00:32:45,758 --> 00:32:48,630
So,
What do you been up to?

617
00:32:48,630 --> 00:32:52,049
Oh, me?
I'm in the KKK now.

618
00:32:52,049 --> 00:32:54,755
Of course you are.
Yes, yes.

619
00:32:54,755 --> 00:32:58,602
- How's your kids?
- My kids. My kids are safe.

620
00:32:58,602 --> 00:33:01,669
That's good.
Family stability is important.

621
00:33:01,753 --> 00:33:04,608
Isn't it, though? Yes.
Yeah.

622
00:33:04,608 --> 00:33:06,259
Disney stuff is crazy, right?

623
00:33:06,259 --> 00:33:10,606
- What?
- Daddy?
He's on trial right now
for, like, a bunch of stuff.

624
00:33:10,606 --> 00:33:12,631
Oh, yeah? Yeah,
I heard about that.

625
00:33:12,711 --> 00:33:15,834
Yeah, yeah. It's so crazy, man.
You think you know a guy

626
00:33:15,834 --> 00:33:19,577
- turns out to be a full, crazy
monster, man?
- Yeah, right.

627
00:33:19,577 --> 00:33:22,437
- So what happened to you?
- What do you mean?

628
00:33:22,437 --> 00:33:25,951
Nothing.
Not one thing.

629
00:33:28,472 --> 00:33:30,631
- Let's wait for the next one.
- Yeah.

630
00:33:30,631 --> 00:33:35,228
Know
there's plenty of room in here.
There's plenty of room
in this elevator.

631
00:33:35,646 --> 00:33:39,654
So Maya's that Jewish

632
00:33:39,654 --> 00:33:42,879
Protestant, actually.
Protestant?
Yeah.
Nice.

633
00:33:42,879 --> 00:33:46,333
Yeah. You know what?
We should take a selfie
together. Come on.

634
00:33:48,415 --> 00:33:51,279
The elevators
are so slow sometimes.

635
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:54,297
- What was that?
- You must have hit stop
or something.

636
00:33:54,297 --> 00:33:57,350
I think we stuck.
Man, we got to be here
for a while now.

637
00:33:57,350 --> 00:34:00,689
Oh, no.
Should we, jump up and down
till something happens?

638
00:34:00,689 --> 00:34:04,182
Nah, man,
I don't like doing crazy stuff.

639
00:34:04,182 --> 00:34:08,135
You don't understand.
I get really claustrophobic.

640
00:34:08,135 --> 00:34:12,632
Oh, trust me, I understand.
I'm a few phobias myself.

641
00:34:13,169 --> 00:34:16,492
But right now,
we just need to relax.

642
00:34:17,095 --> 00:34:19,456
You want some knots? No.

643
00:34:19,456 --> 00:34:21,909
I'm good.
I just got to get out of here.

644
00:34:21,909 --> 00:34:25,044
I gotta calm down, Mike.
You sounded like a lunatic.

645
00:34:25,044 --> 00:34:29,031
Why don't I play you
my next single man?
It's a love song, okay?

646
00:34:29,031 --> 00:34:32,925

Jost and Michael Che.

00:38:02,234 --> 00:38:04,282
Thank you very much.

725
00:38:09,268 --> 00:38:11,108
Thank you.
Good evening everyone.

726
00:38:11,108 --> 00:38:15,002
Welcome to weekend.
Update on Michael Che.
Colin Jost.

727
00:38:15,774 --> 00:38:18,797
Well, President Trump traveled
to the Middle East this week,

728
00:38:18,797 --> 00:38:22,450
and if I were him,
I would have just stayed there
because it looked awesome.

729
00:38:22,517 --> 00:38:26,834
Trump arrived in Saudi Arabia
where he was greeted with a lavender carpet

730
00:38:26,834 --> 00:38:28,986
which
matched the color of his tie

731
00:38:28,986 --> 00:38:31,505
and also the length.

732
00:38:31,505 --> 00:38:36,465
They also rolled out a mobile
McDonald's truck for President
Trump's visit,

733
00:38:36,465 --> 00:38:39,562
featuring Saudi Arabia's
most popular new burger.

734
00:38:39,562 --> 00:38:41,962
The MC journalist.

735
00:38:44,066 --> 00:38:46,559
President Trump,
while on his trip, said

736
00:38:46,559 --> 00:38:50,128
that Iran has sort of agreed
to terms for a nuclear deal.

737
00:38:50,128 --> 00:38:54,117
In the same way, Trump
has sort of agreed
to uphold the Constitution.

738
00:38:54,117 --> 00:38:58,671
Many people
in Saudi Arabia were very happy
with President Trump's
visit to the country,

739
00:38:58,671 --> 00:39:02,889
because rich Saudis
love to fly out thick blonds.

740
00:39:05,126 --> 00:39:08,817
The Democratic
National Committee protested
President Trump's plans

741
00:39:08,817 --> 00:39:12,164
to accept a $400 million luxury
jet from Qatar

742
00:39:12,164 --> 00:39:16,384
by flying a banner over
Mar-A-Lago reading Qatar a Lago.

743
00:39:16,384 --> 00:39:19,853
It's the kind of hilarious stunt
that makes you realize

744
00:39:19,924 --> 00:39:23,182
why the Democrats
will never win again.

745
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:27,783
Ethical experts are also warning
that Trump may owe political favors

746
00:39:27,783 --> 00:39:30,264
to countries
who give him lavish gifts.

747
00:39:30,264 --> 00:39:32,590
But based on the way
he left the Middle East,

748
00:39:32,590 --> 00:39:36,080
I think I know how
Trump is going to pay them back.

749
00:39:43,152 --> 00:39:45,881
President Trump has signed
an executive order

750
00:39:45,881 --> 00:39:49,203
giving refugee status to
white people from South Africa.

751
00:39:49,203 --> 00:39:53,227
You know, I could have sworn
that white people had it
good in South Africa.

752
00:39:53,227 --> 00:39:55,820
Must be the Mandela effect.

753
00:39:58,337 --> 00:40:02,601
The Trump
administration announced
that after face
to face talks with China,

754
00:40:02,601 --> 00:40:06,112
it is lowering tariffs
from 145% to 30%,

755
00:40:06,112 --> 00:40:10,280
which is a little like bragging
about taking the knife out.

756
00:40:13,819 --> 00:40:16,118
Robert F Kennedy Jr,

757
00:40:16,118 --> 00:40:20,473
whose shirt collar traps
all the blood in his head,

758
00:40:20,626 --> 00:40:26,074
was criticized
for posting pictures of himself
swimming in a Washington,
DC creek

759
00:40:26,074 --> 00:40:30,262
 despite signs
warning it was contaminated
with raw sewage.

760
00:40:30,262 --> 00:40:33,388
Oh, can you imagine
how many parasites are in there?

761
00:40:33,388 --> 00:40:35,154
Said the Creek.

762
00:40:36,148 --> 00:40:41,109
The Department of Homeland
Security
said they may participate
in a new reality show

763
00:40:41,109 --> 00:40:45,674
in which immigrants
would go through a series
of challenges for a chance
to become a citizen.

764
00:40:45,674 --> 00:40:49,293
It's called the real
housekeepers of Orange County.

765
00:40:56,771 --> 00:41:01,603
according to a new tell
all book, Biden's inner circle
revealed that they were worried

766
00:41:01,603 --> 00:41:04,550
the president would need
a wheelchair in his second term,

767
00:41:04,550 --> 00:41:09,052
especially after they were all
done stabbing him in the back.

768
00:41:10,501 --> 00:41:14,145
The white House also announced
that Vice President J.D. Vance 

769
00:41:14,145 --> 00:41:18,450
will travel to the Vatican
for Pope Leo's inaugural mass.

770
00:41:18,450 --> 00:41:22,117
And I'm not a huge
fan of his outfit.

771
00:41:23,830 --> 00:41:26,374
Train engineers went on strike
yesterday, 

772
00:41:26,374 --> 00:41:29,635
completely shutting down new Jersey
transit lines into New York.

773
00:41:29,635 --> 00:41:33,529
In case you were wondering
why the city smelled so nice.

774
00:41:37,022 --> 00:41:42,424
In what counts
as good news in 2025,
the Menendez brothers

775
00:41:42,424 --> 00:41:46,536
have been resentenced
for the 1989 murder
of their parents

776
00:41:46,536 --> 00:41:51,182
after the judge said
he did not believe the brothers
posed a risk if released,

777
00:41:51,182 --> 00:41:54,067
unless someone adopts them.

778
00:41:54,067 --> 00:41:56,197
That's a good point.

779
00:41:56,197 --> 00:41:59,819
At this point,
I joked.

780
00:41:59,819 --> 00:42:03,424
After several
troubling incidents
at Newark
Liberty International Airport.

781
00:42:03,424 --> 00:42:05,960
Many people are worried
about airplane safety,

782
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:09,401
but one person is more worried
about airplane food.

783
00:42:09,401 --> 00:42:12,482
Here to comment.
You know her.
You love her.

784
00:42:12,482 --> 00:42:14,909
You got her fined by the FCC.

785
00:42:14,909 --> 00:42:18,011
Show some love for mixology.

786
00:42:21,015 --> 00:42:27,701
Doing

787
00:42:28,236 --> 00:42:30,563
I'm sorry.
What is. This?

788
00:42:30,563 --> 00:42:33,352
Down this flight stack.

789
00:42:33,353 --> 00:42:35,688
And I ain't even served
the food yet.

790
00:42:35,689 --> 00:42:37,489
Flight attendant came around
asking me

791
00:42:37,490 --> 00:42:40,559
if I want some butternut squash
ravioli.

792
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:42,528
More like, but not offer me
that.

793
00:42:42,529 --> 00:42:44,830
Mister, you put some meat in it.

794
00:42:44,831 --> 00:42:47,833
Squash that sucker.

795
00:42:47,834 --> 00:42:49,868
Can't even give me a whole
can of soda.

796
00:42:49,869 --> 00:42:51,570
Stingy.

797
00:42:51,571 --> 00:42:54,306
Want to hand me a dry ass
Biscoff?

798
00:42:54,307 --> 00:42:57,344
More like
you got to piss off Biscoff.

799
00:42:59,245 --> 00:43:00,045
I'm sorry.

800
00:43:00,046 --> 00:43:02,247
Is all of your stand
up about food?

801
00:43:02,248 --> 00:43:04,049
God damn.

802
00:43:04,050 --> 00:43:05,551
I am starving.

803
00:43:05,552 --> 00:43:07,920
Flight attendant saying
the only sandwich they got on

804
00:43:07,921 --> 00:43:09,588
this plane is a turkey pesto.

805
00:43:09,589 --> 00:43:11,056
Auch a bother.

806
00:43:11,057 --> 00:43:12,591
All I know is this bitch about.

807
00:43:12,592 --> 00:43:15,595
To lose her life

808
00:43:15,962 --> 00:43:17,496
that rat was harder than my man.

809
00:43:17,497 --> 00:43:18,732
When I get out the tub.

810
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:23,102
His name's
Maurice, but I call him Trey

811
00:43:23,103 --> 00:43:26,139
because he stay in the upright
and lock position.

812
00:43:27,540 --> 00:43:27,873
Cousin.

813
00:43:27,874 --> 00:43:29,842
His ex-wife.

814
00:43:29,843 --> 00:43:32,311
That's right. Play.

815
00:43:32,312 --> 00:43:33,212
Yeah. I'm sorry.

816
00:43:33,213 --> 00:43:34,713
I really don't think this is
helpful.

817
00:43:34,714 --> 00:43:35,914
Come in. Please.

818
00:43:35,915 --> 00:43:39,284
I'm eating that. She asking?

819
00:43:39,285 --> 00:43:42,422
Do I want some apple
cranberry compote?

820
00:43:43,289 --> 00:43:44,790
I'ma need a computer to Google.

821
00:43:44,791 --> 00:43:47,827
What the hell that is?

822
00:43:50,997 --> 00:43:52,798
Hey, y'all went
into peanuts off the.

823
00:43:52,799 --> 00:43:55,901
Plane because everybody
want to have an allergy.

824
00:43:55,902 --> 00:43:57,836
If you don't take a Benadryl
and shut your.

825
00:43:57,837 --> 00:44:00,372
Gas up,

826
00:44:00,373 --> 00:44:02,474
the hell?

827
00:44:02,475 --> 00:44:02,942
This.

828
00:44:03,209 --> 00:44:05,244
This Newark story is serious.

829
00:44:05,245 --> 00:44:07,913
And how bout that, TSA,

830
00:44:07,914 --> 00:44:10,082
Putting on that Papa Smurf
gloves, thinking

831
00:44:10,083 --> 00:44:11,050
they can fill me up.

832
00:44:11,051 --> 00:44:14,054
Just because I got a God.

833
00:44:14,954 --> 00:44:16,121
Complex empty stack.

834
00:44:16,122 --> 00:44:19,091
What? That's right.

835
00:44:19,092 --> 00:44:21,393
Stretch, y'all.

836
00:44:21,394 --> 00:44:24,430
You are supposed to be talking
about Newark Airport.

837
00:44:24,431 --> 00:44:27,434
I literally am listening here.

838
00:44:29,269 --> 00:44:30,069
Menopause.

839
00:44:30,070 --> 00:44:31,070
Been making me whole.

840
00:44:31,071 --> 00:44:32,371
Menopause?

841
00:44:32,372 --> 00:44:35,074
Well.

842
00:44:35,075 --> 00:44:37,810
Let's just say, Miss Egg,
you don't need no hollandaise

843
00:44:37,811 --> 00:44:39,211
sauce
because I already know how to.

844
00:44:39,212 --> 00:44:42,248
Benedict.

845
00:44:43,516 --> 00:44:46,418
Okay, here you go.

846
00:44:46,419 --> 00:44:48,087
Please. There you go. Not.

847
00:44:48,088 --> 00:44:51,190
Please wrap this up.
No collusion.

848
00:44:51,191 --> 00:44:54,227
Thank you, JetBlue,
for having a bitch.

849
00:44:54,794 --> 00:44:57,763
And if we hit turbulence, Colin,
just take a Benadryl.

850
00:44:57,764 --> 00:44:58,797
And what?

851
00:44:58,798 --> 00:45:01,835
Shut your gas up.

852
00:45:03,670 --> 00:45:04,870
Enjoy the flight.

853
00:45:04,871 --> 00:45:07,874
Mrs...

854
00:45:16,016 --> 00:45:19,913
New research
shows that too much sitting
could damage your brain.

855
00:45:19,913 --> 00:45:24,068
Which explains why Stephen
Hawking was such a dumb ass.

856
00:45:28,140 --> 00:45:33,603
Dick's Sporting Goods announced
that it is buying Foot Locker
for more than $2 billion,

857
00:45:33,603 --> 00:45:37,163
and will combine to form
Dick Focker's.

858
00:45:38,482 --> 00:45:42,632
Annual survey found
that the worst litterers in New
York City 

859
00:45:42,632 --> 00:45:44,814
are men from the Bronx
and Queens,

860
00:45:44,814 --> 00:45:46,460
while women from the Bronx
and Queens

861
00:45:46,460 --> 00:45:49,830
 safely keep
all their junk in the trunk.

862
00:45:53,530 --> 00:45:56,089
A driver for Amazon was fired

863
00:45:56,089 --> 00:46:00,060
after she was caught on a ring 
camera defecating on a porch,

864
00:46:00,060 --> 00:46:03,673
said the homeowner.
But that's what I ordered.

865
00:46:04,737 --> 00:46:07,986
A new study suggests
that people who feel tired
all the time

866
00:46:07,986 --> 00:46:09,718
could have suffered
a mini stroke,

867
00:46:09,718 --> 00:46:13,670
which makes sense
because I always get sleepy
after a stroke.

868
00:46:16,790 --> 00:46:20,362
Know?
I don't take time.

869
00:46:21,442 --> 00:46:23,554
It was a heartwarming
one to end on.

870
00:46:23,554 --> 00:46:28,288
You know, tonight is our season
finale, and we, I'm not sure

871
00:46:29,356 --> 00:46:32,057
your last joke
took my breath away.

872
00:46:32,058 --> 00:46:33,559
And we have a tradition here.

873
00:46:33,560 --> 00:46:34,760
We're gonna give each other

874
00:46:34,761 --> 00:46:39,164
joke Street
at the end of the season.

875
00:46:39,165 --> 00:46:41,800
Yeah, we're making each other
three.

876
00:46:41,801 --> 00:46:45,771
Jokes live on air that the other
person has never seen before.

877
00:46:45,772 --> 00:46:50,876
But before we start,
it's SNL 50th season.

878
00:46:50,877 --> 00:46:53,879
So I want to take a moment
to say something to our boss,

879
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:55,081
Lorne Michaels.

880
00:46:56,383 --> 00:46:59,386
Lorne retire bitch.

881
00:47:01,454 --> 00:47:04,757
Let me run the show.

882
00:47:04,758 --> 00:47:06,625
Wow. Out the gate, Colin.

883
00:47:06,626 --> 00:47:09,061
Well, maybe I should just
tell you the first joke.

884
00:47:09,062 --> 00:47:09,728
How about that?

885
00:47:09,729 --> 00:47:11,330
Oh, I get to do another.

886
00:47:11,331 --> 00:47:13,832
Yeah, yeah,
it's all a joke, man.

887
00:47:13,833 --> 00:47:16,602
CBS has premiered
the first hour long

888
00:47:16,603 --> 00:47:20,806
daytime soap opera
with a predominantly black cast.

889
00:47:20,807 --> 00:47:25,044
It'll air when black people
are home from work 24 hours.

890
00:47:25,045 --> 00:47:28,081
The ticket.

891
00:47:33,420 --> 00:47:35,955
Since you like that,

892
00:47:36,056 --> 00:47:38,057
here's another.

893
00:47:38,058 --> 00:47:40,859
CBS has premiered
the first half hour

894
00:47:40,860 --> 00:47:45,064
long daytime soap opera
with a predominantly black cast.

895
00:47:45,065 --> 00:47:48,067
It's called All My Children
don't know

896
00:47:48,068 --> 00:47:51,071
who their daddy.

897
00:47:54,607 --> 00:47:54,974
Movie

898
00:47:55,709 --> 00:47:57,543
theaters are trying
to stop teenagers from screaming

899
00:47:57,544 --> 00:48:00,145
and throwing popcorn
during the Minecraft scene

900
00:48:00,146 --> 00:48:02,014
with the chicken jockey,

901
00:48:02,015 --> 00:48:06,685
because some of us
are trying to masturbate.

902
00:48:06,686 --> 00:48:09,121
But seriously,
Minecraft was a great movie.

903
00:48:09,122 --> 00:48:13,058
I haven't been that excited
since I saw a white woman

904
00:48:13,059 --> 00:48:14,394
drink unattended.

905
00:48:20,633 --> 00:48:25,070
It's so exciting for you!

906
00:48:25,071 --> 00:48:25,604
I wonder,

907
00:48:25,605 --> 00:48:29,475
oh man, why isn't this

908
00:48:29,476 --> 00:48:30,409
a new. Yeah, it could be.

909
00:48:30,410 --> 00:48:32,311
And it could be nice. Yeah.

910
00:48:32,312 --> 00:48:35,748
A new study finds that the hoots
and grunts of bonobos

911
00:48:35,749 --> 00:48:40,252
show signs of complex thoughts
similar to human language.

912
00:48:40,253 --> 00:48:43,289
Oh. So like that awful
halftime show.

913
00:48:51,765 --> 00:48:53,399
You know,
before I tell another joke, I.

914
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:56,568
Want to take this opportunity
to apologize to someone I hurt.

915
00:48:56,569 --> 00:48:59,606
Scarlett, can you come out here?

916
00:49:04,577 --> 00:49:05,811
Oh, I just, you know, last.

917
00:49:05,812 --> 00:49:07,513
Time we did jokes, I made Colin

918
00:49:07,514 --> 00:49:11,517
do some tasteless jokes
comparing your vagina to Costco.

919
00:49:11,518 --> 00:49:13,920
Roast beef?

920
00:49:14,020 --> 00:49:15,922
Yes, I remember that.

921
00:49:16,022 --> 00:49:20,426
Well, the fact is, I was just
lashing out because I'm jealous.

922
00:49:20,427 --> 00:49:25,064
I've never even seen
a human vagina.

923
00:49:25,065 --> 00:49:28,167
And notice I said human

924
00:49:28,168 --> 00:49:31,470
because I
once spent the summer on a farm.

925
00:49:31,471 --> 00:49:35,140
You found me.

926
00:49:35,141 --> 00:49:37,376
Maybe I'm just embarrassed
about my own body.

927
00:49:37,377 --> 00:49:39,345
I can't even take my hoodie off
during sex

928
00:49:39,346 --> 00:49:44,083
because I have more nipples
than a pregnant dog.

929
00:49:44,084 --> 00:49:45,451
Yes, I have heard that about.

930
00:49:45,452 --> 00:49:46,452
You and Colin.

931
00:49:46,453 --> 00:49:51,056
I'm sorry too, because I owe you
everything. Oh,

932
00:49:51,057 --> 00:49:53,359
when Colin discovered me,
I was selling

933
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:57,129
crack outside the.

934
00:49:57,130 --> 00:49:58,764
And now look at me selling crack

935
00:49:58,765 --> 00:50:02,835
outside the American Girl doll.

936
00:50:02,836 --> 00:50:04,870
I'm so thousands of jokes
for an update

937
00:50:04,871 --> 00:50:07,940
and gotten dozens of laughs.

938
00:50:07,941 --> 00:50:12,011
But I've never said the three
most important words of all.

939
00:50:12,012 --> 00:50:15,314
I love you.

940
00:50:15,315 --> 00:50:20,052
Oh, on.

941
00:50:20,053 --> 00:50:21,120
Truth.

942
00:50:21,121 --> 00:50:23,922
I love you too. Oh. Well.

943
00:50:23,923 --> 00:50:25,391
Yeah.

944
00:50:25,392 --> 00:50:26,925
Okay.

945
00:50:26,926 --> 00:50:28,761
Before I continue.

946
00:50:28,762 --> 00:50:32,131
Golden State Warriors
head coach Steve Kerr

947
00:50:32,132 --> 00:50:35,067
is here with his family.

948
00:50:35,068 --> 00:50:39,371
I got to meet his son,
Nick, and I love Steve.

949
00:50:39,372 --> 00:50:42,641
I like Nick.

950
00:50:42,642 --> 00:50:44,076
But I wouldn't say I'm

951
00:50:44,077 --> 00:50:47,113
a Nick Kerr lover.

952
00:50:56,523 --> 00:51:03,062
Besides, the Hollywood star.

953
00:51:03,063 --> 00:51:05,564
Some psychologists say adults

954
00:51:05,565 --> 00:51:09,668
can reduce stress by returning
to a childhood hobby.

955
00:51:09,669 --> 00:51:13,305
Which is why I returned
to my favorite childhood hobby

956
00:51:13,306 --> 00:51:16,343
topping off priests
with my pretty little mouth.

957
00:51:22,315 --> 00:51:25,318
Speaking of which.

958
00:51:41,568 --> 00:51:42,368
Lawn.

959
00:51:42,369 --> 00:51:43,602
I'll do anything.

960
00:51:43,603 --> 00:51:46,639
To run this show

961
00:51:48,508 --> 00:51:54,314
For Weekend Update
I|m Michael Che I|m Colin Jost
Goodnight

962
00:52:06,860 --> 00:52:07,760
All right, everyone,

963
00:52:07,761 --> 00:52:10,896
welcome to day
one of shooting Penelope.

964
00:52:10,897 --> 00:52:13,232
Secret. Yes.

965
00:52:13,233 --> 00:52:16,669
It's a romance
about two women in the 50s

966
00:52:16,670 --> 00:52:18,737
who fall deeply in love.

967
00:52:18,738 --> 00:52:20,773
And, yes, I'm the director.

968
00:52:20,774 --> 00:52:23,075
And yes, I am a man.

969
00:52:23,076 --> 00:52:28,347
So we, Why don't I throw
to our assistant director who.

970
00:52:28,348 --> 00:52:30,582
And this will make you all feel
better.

971
00:52:30,583 --> 00:52:31,985
Is a woman.

972
00:52:32,085 --> 00:52:35,421
Yay, woman. Thanks, Greg.

973
00:52:35,422 --> 00:52:36,990
Actually, I'm non-binary.

974
00:52:37,090 --> 00:52:40,092
Oops. Sorry.

975
00:52:40,093 --> 00:52:42,561
Okay, so our first scene up
today will be the one where

976
00:52:42,562 --> 00:52:45,731
Penelope and Madame Wilcox
first become intimate.

977
00:52:45,732 --> 00:52:48,767
And to make sure everyone
feels safe and comfortable,

978
00:52:48,768 --> 00:52:51,537
we've brought in two intimacy
coordinators.

979
00:52:51,538 --> 00:52:53,772
Guys,
want to introduce yourselves?

980
00:52:53,773 --> 00:52:55,774
Yeah. Hi, everyone. I'm Trish.

981
00:52:55,775 --> 00:52:57,576
And this is an insane
coincidence,

982
00:52:57,577 --> 00:53:01,747
but my name is also Madame
Wilcox.

983
00:53:01,748 --> 00:53:03,349
Well,
thanks for being here, you guys.

984
00:53:03,350 --> 00:53:04,516
Thanks for having us.

985
00:53:04,517 --> 00:53:07,252
Now, where is our cast?
Right over here.

986
00:53:07,253 --> 00:53:10,489
This is Annabel,
and this is Rachel.

987
00:53:10,490 --> 00:53:11,790
Great to meet you.

988
00:53:11,791 --> 00:53:14,860
So where's the dude?

989
00:53:14,861 --> 00:53:16,628
Oh, there's no dude.

990
00:53:16,629 --> 00:53:18,063
Just the two women.

991
00:53:18,064 --> 00:53:18,431
Yeah.

992
00:53:19,065 --> 00:53:21,200
Okay, so it's just a kissing
scene, right? Right.

993
00:53:21,201 --> 00:53:22,634
That's great.

994
00:53:22,635 --> 00:53:27,406
No, guys, it's a full love scene
between two women.

995
00:53:27,407 --> 00:53:33,145
But how would that even work?

996
00:53:33,146 --> 00:53:34,313
What do you mean?

997
00:53:34,314 --> 00:53:34,780
Oh, no.

998
00:53:34,781 --> 00:53:35,814
He's just confused

999
00:53:35,815 --> 00:53:39,651
because he doesn't get
how two buns make a hot dog.

1000
00:53:39,652 --> 00:53:41,086
I get it, I love it.

1001
00:53:41,087 --> 00:53:44,456
But wait, like, two donuts isn't
exactly a balanced breakfast.

1002
00:53:44,457 --> 00:53:48,627
It's simply too much tunnel,
not enough train.

1003
00:53:48,628 --> 00:53:49,562
Okay.

1004
00:53:49,896 --> 00:53:53,699
I'm sorry, have you guys never
worked on a queer set before?

1005
00:53:53,700 --> 00:53:58,170
Or as us allies
like to call it, an overdue set?

1006
00:53:58,171 --> 00:54:01,640
Am I right? Yeah. Okay. Okay.

1007
00:54:01,641 --> 00:54:02,841
Just get it together.

1008
00:54:02,842 --> 00:54:03,776
Whoops. I'm sorry.

1009
00:54:03,777 --> 00:54:05,744
Yeah. Of course. We've worked on
queer sets.

1010
00:54:05,745 --> 00:54:09,782
I mean,
I myself am ally passing.

1011
00:54:09,783 --> 00:54:12,317
But it's
different for girls, right?

1012
00:54:12,318 --> 00:54:17,089
Like gay guys, I get a
but it's basically of a dude.

1013
00:54:17,090 --> 00:54:18,323
I'm sorry.

1014
00:54:18,324 --> 00:54:21,326
Do you think lesbians don't
have sex?

1015
00:54:21,327 --> 00:54:24,196
Oh, well, I hope this isn't
offensive, but real sex.

1016
00:54:24,197 --> 00:54:25,864
No, no I don't.

1017
00:54:25,865 --> 00:54:26,232
You know what?

1018
00:54:26,766 --> 00:54:28,067
He's just having trouble
understanding

1019
00:54:28,068 --> 00:54:32,371
how you'd pay without putting
a credit card in a reader. Oh.

1020
00:54:32,372 --> 00:54:35,408
Is it like Apple Pay
where you just tap the Googles?

1021
00:54:37,377 --> 00:54:38,110
Sorry, dude.

1022
00:54:38,111 --> 00:54:39,845
The Googles.

1023
00:54:39,846 --> 00:54:41,413
Seriously? My guy.

1024
00:54:41,414 --> 00:54:45,851
This is highly offensive
to lesbian folks.

1025
00:54:45,852 --> 00:54:48,787
Actually,
that's not totally wrong.

1026
00:54:48,788 --> 00:54:52,458
Oh, she's so annoying, dude.

1027
00:54:52,459 --> 00:54:53,292
Sorry.

1028
00:54:53,293 --> 00:54:56,161
They are so annoying.

1029
00:54:56,162 --> 00:54:56,929
You know what?

1030
00:54:56,930 --> 00:54:59,498
Maybe
just try to picture it. But.

1031
00:54:59,499 --> 00:55:03,135
Guess I could give it a shot.

1032
00:55:03,136 --> 00:55:12,077
Oh. Well, that is nice.

1033
00:55:12,078 --> 00:55:15,314
You know, perhaps there's
some online videos of two ladies

1034
00:55:15,315 --> 00:55:17,282
that I could watch
as further research.

1035
00:55:17,283 --> 00:55:19,953
Yeah, I think I'm gonna go
watch some videos of two ladies

1036
00:55:20,053 --> 00:55:23,522
right now.

1037
00:55:23,523 --> 00:55:24,958
Wow. Okay.

1038
00:55:25,058 --> 00:55:28,527
He was
in a hurry with the weather.

1039
00:55:28,528 --> 00:55:29,728
Wait, what's the weather.
What's the weather.

1040
00:55:29,729 --> 00:55:31,497
What's the website.
What's the weather.

1041
00:55:31,498 --> 00:55:34,133
App. Yeah okay

1042
00:55:34,134 --> 00:55:36,168
guys we got to get going here.

1043
00:55:36,169 --> 00:55:38,537
Can we move on with the scene?
You know what?

1044
00:55:38,538 --> 00:55:40,472
Let's just do it,

1045
00:55:40,473 --> 00:55:42,509
Hooray

1046
00:55:56,723 --> 00:55:57,523
What's up man?

1047
00:55:57,524 --> 00:55:58,657
This is TV tech.

1048
00:55:58,658 --> 00:56:01,694
We talked to your favorite cast
from your favorite show.

1049
00:56:01,695 --> 00:56:03,028
Yeah, and we're so excited.

1050
00:56:03,029 --> 00:56:05,564
This was our most requested
show this year.

1051
00:56:05,565 --> 00:56:07,333
Joining us
today is the cast of the hit

1052
00:56:07,334 --> 00:56:10,337
romance Summer Lake. Hey.

1053
00:56:11,171 --> 00:56:12,304
Thanks for being here, guys.

1054
00:56:12,305 --> 00:56:14,773
We've got a ton of questions
for the whole cast.

1055
00:56:14,774 --> 00:56:16,909
There's so much for
the fans are dying to know.

1056
00:56:16,910 --> 00:56:17,876
But we're going to start

1057
00:56:17,877 --> 00:56:20,746
with the internet's boyfriend,
Danny Cheeks.

1058
00:56:20,747 --> 00:56:23,783
Oh. Hey, guys, it's me.

1059
00:56:24,617 --> 00:56:26,085
So, Danny,
first question is for you.

1060
00:56:26,086 --> 00:56:29,054
Your character is always wearing
his signature hoodies.

1061
00:56:29,055 --> 00:56:31,457
Were those
from your real closet?

1062
00:56:31,458 --> 00:56:34,761
No. I wish, but the wardrobe
department knew what was up.

1063
00:56:35,195 --> 00:56:36,628
They really did.
And next question.

1064
00:56:36,629 --> 00:56:38,530
Danny,
how did you get into acting?

1065
00:56:38,531 --> 00:56:41,167
Well, I love watching
TV, so I wanted to try it.

1066
00:56:43,236 --> 00:56:45,070
And our next
question is for you, Rochelle.

1067
00:56:45,071 --> 00:56:47,773
What's harder
being a woman or being black?

1068
00:56:47,774 --> 00:56:50,843
Oh, that's my question.

1069
00:56:50,844 --> 00:56:52,745
Yeah. So let's go back to Danny.

1070
00:56:52,746 --> 00:56:54,813
Was it fun shooting at the lake?

1071
00:56:54,814 --> 00:56:57,950
Oh, it was fun, but it was hot.

1072
00:56:57,951 --> 00:56:59,218
Yeah. Low hot.

1073
00:56:59,219 --> 00:57:02,255
And, Jade, when's the last time
you took plan B?

1074
00:57:02,589 --> 00:57:05,024
Whoa. Don't ask that.

1075
00:57:05,025 --> 00:57:08,628
Okay, so, Danny, do you have
a favorite on set snack?

1076
00:57:09,029 --> 00:57:11,563
Oh, man. That's hard.

1077
00:57:11,564 --> 00:57:13,565
Maybe pretzels.

1078
00:57:13,566 --> 00:57:15,701
Ooh. Nice. Salty.

1079
00:57:15,702 --> 00:57:16,735
And now, Kasey,

1080
00:57:16,736 --> 00:57:19,739
you're not as attractive
as the other cast members.

1081
00:57:20,674 --> 00:57:23,208
That's not a question.

1082
00:57:23,209 --> 00:57:24,443
It's what the fans are saying.

1083
00:57:24,444 --> 00:57:27,079
So, Danny,
who are you dating these days?

1084
00:57:27,080 --> 00:57:29,114
Oh, I don't kiss and tell.

1085
00:57:29,115 --> 00:57:30,516
Of course, that's private.

1086
00:57:30,517 --> 00:57:32,952
So, Taylor, you just had
a really bad divorce.

1087
00:57:33,053 --> 00:57:35,155
Whose fault was
it? You or your husband's?

1088
00:57:36,556 --> 00:57:39,358
It was
a girl, and it was my fault.

1089
00:57:39,359 --> 00:57:41,126
Oh, wait.

1090
00:57:41,127 --> 00:57:43,362
Danny, is it fun having abs?

1091
00:57:43,363 --> 00:57:45,931
Yeah, I love it.

1092
00:57:45,932 --> 00:57:47,099
Why can't we get.

1093
00:57:47,100 --> 00:57:49,802
Questions like that?
Okay, Kasey, here's a fun one.

1094
00:57:49,803 --> 00:57:51,704
You recently got married.
Congrats.

1095
00:57:51,705 --> 00:57:54,741
So why isn't your husband
a Ukrainian refugees?

1096
00:57:54,941 --> 00:57:57,810
That was a fun one.

1097
00:57:57,811 --> 00:58:00,012
I had fun.

1098
00:58:00,013 --> 00:58:03,016
Danny, when's the last time
you laughed really hard.

1099
00:58:03,316 --> 00:58:06,018
Watching TikTok pranks?

1100
00:58:06,019 --> 00:58:07,219
Where shall we go to? You.

1101
00:58:07,220 --> 00:58:08,354
Deadline reported that you're

1102
00:58:08,355 --> 00:58:10,122
being written out of the show
next season.

1103
00:58:10,123 --> 00:58:12,926
Is it because someone leaked
your nudes?

1104
00:58:13,026 --> 00:58:16,029
I'm just learning about
all parts of that right now.

1105
00:58:17,230 --> 00:58:19,264
Really? It's everywhere.

1106
00:58:19,265 --> 00:58:22,101
Now, Danny,
what's your favorite?

1107
00:58:22,102 --> 00:58:23,702
Everything.

1108
00:58:23,703 --> 00:58:25,604
Oh, Danny. Hold up.

1109
00:58:25,605 --> 00:58:27,106
Am I being written
out of the show?

1110
00:58:27,107 --> 00:58:29,742

1127
00:59:05,011 --> 00:59:08,014
Yes. And,
Danny, music or pictures?

1128
00:59:08,248 --> 00:59:10,082

1129
00:59:10,083 --> 00:59:11,583
And finally, to all the women.

1130
00:59:11,584 --> 00:59:12,518
Gun to your head.

1131
00:59:12,519 --> 00:59:15,020

1132

What do you. Mean?

1133
00:59:16,156 --> 00:59:17,122
Now, let me rephrase.

1134
00:59:17,123 --> 00:59:18,657
If a lesbian was raised in a lab

1135
00:59:18,658 --> 00:59:21,695
and never saw another person,
would she still dress like that?
