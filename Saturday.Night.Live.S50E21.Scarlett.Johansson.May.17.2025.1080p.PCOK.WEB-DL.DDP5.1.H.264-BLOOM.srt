1
00:00:02,075 --> 00:00:05,771
Trip

2
00:00:05,771 --> 00:00:07,845
alliances

3
00:00:07,845 --> 00:00:10,881
Both

4
00:00:10,881 --> 00:00:12,324
Powerful

5
00:00:12,324 --> 00:00:14,955
Love

6
00:00:18,006 --> 00:00:22,463
Mom, dad,
this is Crown
Prince Mohammed bin Salman.

7
00:00:22,463 --> 00:00:25,433
And we're together
now, getting off gorgeous.

8
00:00:25,433 --> 00:00:27,069
But we are vibing.

9
00:00:27,069 --> 00:00:29,679
You are too kind.
Habibi.

10
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:32,857
Habibi Habibi
What a word.

11
00:00:32,857 --> 00:00:35,764
But we've been having
a lot of fun in the Middle East.

12
00:00:35,764 --> 00:00:37,186
I've been having a great time.

13
00:00:37,186 --> 00:00:40,757
We've been eating a lot
of meals, sitting on the floor,

14
00:00:40,757 --> 00:00:45,348
dipping our fingers straight
into various goops and spreads

15
00:00:45,348 --> 00:00:47,502
that I politely scrape
under the rug

16
00:00:47,502 --> 00:00:51,523
and go eat at a mobile
McDonald's.
That you build for me
isn't that way.

17
00:00:52,157 --> 00:00:54,341
BA ba
ba ba ba ba. He's loving it.

18
00:00:54,341 --> 00:00:59,265
I, of course, am a big fan
of everything that Saudi Arabia has to offer,

19
00:00:59,265 --> 00:01:01,769
from the oil
to the money

20
00:01:01,769 --> 00:01:03,668
to end of list.

21
00:01:03,668 --> 00:01:08,280
But it's been a fantastic week
in the Middle East.

22
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:12,382
I also went to Qatar, the UAE

23
00:01:12,382 --> 00:01:16,580
and much like God did during
Passover, I skipped Israel.

24
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:17,751
Oh well,

25
00:01:17,751 --> 00:01:21,835
I bet you were happy about that
though.
You like that, right?

26
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:24,038
No comment.

27
00:01:24,038 --> 00:01:26,376
Don't comment.
You don't want to say anything.

28
00:01:26,376 --> 00:01:27,357
Cancel culture.

29
00:01:27,357 --> 00:01:31,543
But I did make this trip.
I didn't make this trip
for myself.

30
00:01:31,543 --> 00:01:35,230
I want to make that clear.
I did this
for the American people

31
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:39,647
and in many ways myself
by my personal enrichment.

32
00:01:39,647 --> 00:01:42,223
I did that too.
I did very well on this trip.

33
00:01:42,223 --> 00:01:44,466
Got a lot of cool stuff.

34
00:01:44,466 --> 00:01:49,058
The Qataris
gave me a $400 million plane.
Can you believe that?

35
00:01:49,058 --> 00:01:51,854
And people said
that was some sort of bribe.
Not true,

36
00:01:51,854 --> 00:01:55,917
not true because they haven't
asked for anything in return.

37
00:01:55,917 --> 00:01:58,364
Well, not yet.

38
00:01:58,364 --> 00:02:01,003
All right, so it's a pre bribe.
It's a pre bribe.

39
00:02:01,003 --> 00:02:05,977
But now people are saying
I should really be flying
in an American plane.

40
00:02:05,977 --> 00:02:07,326
No, thanks. Andy,

41
00:02:07,326 --> 00:02:10,628
have you seen
what's going on with our planes?

42
00:02:10,628 --> 00:02:13,902
The radar is down
and the screen is blank.

43
00:02:13,902 --> 00:02:15,209
Newark

44
00:02:15,849 --> 00:02:18,859
Darling, watch.
Where are we going?

45
00:02:18,859 --> 00:02:21,627
Where are we flying for
our vacation?

46
00:02:21,627 --> 00:02:23,848
I need directly into the ground.

47
00:02:23,848 --> 00:02:26,266
But we just made it big.
Oh shut up!

48
00:02:26,266 --> 00:02:30,001
But we just made a big airplane
deal with the Crown Prince.

49
00:02:30,001 --> 00:02:30,917
Tell them about it.

50
00:02:30,917 --> 00:02:36,557
Saudi Arabia will buy $1 billion
worth of aircraft from Boeing.

51
00:02:36,557 --> 00:02:38,061
Your funeral.

52
00:02:38,061 --> 00:02:42,772
I met with the leader of the UAE
in Abu Dhabi.

53
00:02:42,772 --> 00:02:44,872
We like to say Abu Dhabi.

54
00:02:44,872 --> 00:02:50,690
Abu Dhabi do like the
late great Fred Flintstone.

55
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:56,083
The UAE
promised to invest over $1
trillion in the US.

56
00:02:56,083 --> 00:03:00,879
I love Dubai because they Dubai
a lot of weapons.

57
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:03,923
But I've had a great trip
here in the Middle East.

58
00:03:03,923 --> 00:03:07,757
It was very much a boys trip.
I don't think
I saw a single woman.

59
00:03:07,757 --> 00:03:09,399
What's up with that,

60
00:03:09,399 --> 00:03:12,150
All the time Just walking into a room
full of boys.

61
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:14,939
Hi, boys. Boys again?

62
00:03:14,939 --> 00:03:16,762
The women are all hiding.

63
00:03:16,763 --> 00:03:19,012
It's like a nation of Melania's.

64
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:21,667
Very funny.

65
00:03:21,667 --> 00:03:24,723
There it is.
Look at that baby. I'm
going to look that up.

66
00:03:24,723 --> 00:03:26,584
I'm cooking.
I'm having a great time.

67
00:03:26,584 --> 00:03:30,091
I was just going to say it.
I love the Arabs.
I love the Arabs.

68
00:03:30,091 --> 00:03:32,804
I don't want to go home.
Let me stay.

69
00:03:32,804 --> 00:03:37,153
Get me to Allah's country.
Everyone loves me here.

70
00:03:37,153 --> 00:03:39,117
They're not allowed to.

71
00:03:39,117 --> 00:03:42,776
They have to love you.
If not, bye bye.

72
00:03:42,776 --> 00:03:44,811
Inshallah.

73
00:03:44,811 --> 00:03:47,079
Oh, I love that.

74
00:03:47,079 --> 00:03:50,975
Donald. Please, stay.
They build a palace
next to mine and stay.

75
00:03:50,975 --> 00:03:54,490
Oh, I sadly, I can't.
I have to get back home.

76
00:03:54,490 --> 00:03:58,713
Luckily,
we have our own little slice
of Saudi Arabia in America.

77
00:03:58,713 --> 00:04:00,407
A dry
desert area

78
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:03,604
filled with people
who are way too
into their religion.

79
00:04:03,604 --> 00:04:05,514
We call ours UTAH

80
00:04:05,514 --> 00:04:10,081
and I do very well there,
so I can't stay here
in the Middle East.

81
00:04:10,081 --> 00:04:13,304
In fact,
you know what?
I can't even stay in this sketch
much long

82
00:04:13,304 --> 00:04:17,976
going. I have to leave. You know what?
Because it's the SNL
finale season 50.

83
00:04:17,976 --> 00:04:19,980
Worst one yet.

84
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:21,568
Okay. Get up.

85
00:04:21,568 --> 00:04:25,510
Go ahead, get up.
Get out of there.
Let me sit here. Yeah,
go with him.

86
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:28,438
Go eat
some chips in the hallway.

87
00:04:28,438 --> 00:04:31,790
I'm here
to break the fourth wall.

88
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:35,850
Oh, it's nice here
with all the young people.

89
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:37,658
Look at her. Wow.

90
00:04:37,658 --> 00:04:39,663
Seven zero

91
00:04:39,663 --> 00:04:41,982
sevens or more.
Sit on the floor.

92
00:04:41,982 --> 00:04:45,220
Six and below to the bleachers
you go.

93
00:04:47,635 --> 00:04:50,146
Get over it.
Over.

94
00:04:50,146 --> 00:04:52,759
It's like an Gutfeld joke.
Kind of rhymed, right?

95
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:56,009
But, you know,
since it's a finale,
that means after tonight,

96
00:04:56,009 --> 00:04:59,267
you won't be
seeing me here for a while. Oh.

97
00:04:59,267 --> 00:05:04,104
Oh, well,
not the fake fun version of me
that makes you smile.

98
00:05:04,104 --> 00:05:06,224
The real one
will still be omnipresent.

99
00:05:06,224 --> 00:05:08,868
You can't escape me, right?
I'm everywhere.

100
00:05:08,868 --> 00:05:11,282
Even in your dreams.
Even in your dreams.

101
00:05:11,282 --> 00:05:13,349
Like the late, great
Freddy Krueger.

102
00:05:13,349 --> 00:05:15,105
Supposed

103
00:05:15,105 --> 00:05:17,405
So see you again in the fall.

104
00:05:17,405 --> 00:05:19,906
If we still have a country, right.
It's a coin toss

105
00:05:19,906 --> 00:05:21,542
this summer,
everyone

106
00:05:21,542 --> 00:05:26,206
and live from New York.
It's Saturday Night

107
00:07:45,499 --> 00:07:50,939
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN-- SCARLETT
JOHANSSON!

108
00:08:08,206 --> 00:08:11,681
OH, THANK YOU, THANK YOU,
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

109
00:08:11,681 --> 00:08:16,943
I AM SO EXCITED TO BE HOSTING
THE FINALE OF SEASON 50.

110
00:08:18,626 --> 00:08:22,134
IT'S BEEN A HISTORIC SEASON.
I'M SO PROUD TO BE A PART OF IT.

111
00:08:22,134 --> 00:08:25,013
I FIRST HOSTED THIS SHOW WHEN I
WAS 21 YEARS OLD,

112
00:08:25,013 --> 00:08:28,921
SO IT'S CRAZY
TO BE BACK HERE LIKE WHAT, THREE
YEARS LATER.

113
00:08:28,921 --> 00:08:30,609
TIME REALLY FLIES.

114
00:08:30,609 --> 00:08:35,413

00:12:09,888 --> 00:12:13,940
It's channel four.
Wake up for the news

166
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:16,409
because
you're watching channel four.

167
00:12:16,409 --> 00:12:18,326
New York City News

168
00:12:18,326 --> 00:12:21,001
because it is channel four.

169
00:12:21,001 --> 00:12:23,952
It's channel four.

170
00:12:25,919 --> 00:12:28,115
That was our weather man, Keith.

171
00:12:28,115 --> 00:12:31,873
He said any one of the shot
to try something new
for our intro and. Well.

172
00:12:31,873 --> 00:12:33,724
Shot taken. Keith.

173
00:12:33,724 --> 00:12:36,625
Swing and a miss, folks.

174
00:12:36,936 --> 00:12:39,056
Good morning, New York.

175
00:12:39,056 --> 00:12:41,183
And thanks, as always,
for waking up with us.

176
00:12:41,183 --> 00:12:42,426
I'm Susan McGrath.

177
00:12:42,426 --> 00:12:44,951
I'm Tommy Nolan, our usual third
wheel.

178
00:12:44,951 --> 00:12:46,680
Claire Connors, is out today.

179
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,270
I can't legally say why,

180
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:51,463
but let's just say
she gave birth to something.

181
00:12:51,463 --> 00:12:54,221
But filling in for her.
This morning,

182
00:12:54,221 --> 00:12:56,930
we have another member
of our channel four family,

183
00:12:56,930 --> 00:12:58,995
Denise Jones
from the Nightly News.

184
00:12:58,995 --> 00:13:00,852
So happy you're here.
Joining us, Denise.

185
00:13:00,852 --> 00:13:02,306
Thanks for having me.

186
00:13:02,306 --> 00:13:06,180
All right.
Let's get to our top stories
coming up later this morning.

187
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:07,828
It's a doggone miracle.

188
00:13:07,828 --> 00:13:12,289
A new layer of astroturf
has been installed
at the Riverside Dog Park.

189
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:15,414
And later
we tip our cap,

190
00:13:15,414 --> 00:13:17,847
a chino
to Little Bean coffee shop,

191
00:13:17,847 --> 00:13:21,640
which donates
all their leftover pastries
to a local homeless shelter.

192
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:25,515
Well, cap a chino,
and it's a doggone miracle.

193
00:13:25,515 --> 00:13:27,155
I love those little puns.

194
00:13:27,155 --> 00:13:31,231
Yeah,
they make our morning stories
a little extra fun
for our early risers.

195
00:13:31,231 --> 00:13:35,484
Well, that's so creative.
We don't usually do
those on the nightly news.

196
00:13:35,484 --> 00:13:39,638
All right, well,
you want to take the next one?
- Sure thing.

197
00:13:39,638 --> 00:13:41,949
Next up, the hospital.

198
00:13:41,949 --> 00:13:45,226
Last night, a woman
was assaulted on the train.

199
00:13:46,574 --> 00:13:49,243
I know, I did a pun.

200
00:13:50,086 --> 00:13:53,817
Well, Denise,
I just think that story
was a little too intense
for that.

201
00:13:53,817 --> 00:13:57,786
Oh, I get it.
You mean the pun is only okay
when it's something like this?

202
00:13:57,786 --> 00:14:00,572
Later,
we tip our cappuccino, know

203
00:14:00,573 --> 00:14:02,921
to the woman
who was assaulted on the train.

204
00:14:02,921 --> 00:14:04,913
Somehow worse.

205
00:14:04,913 --> 00:14:08,488
You know, why
don't we just focus
on the lighter stories, okay?

206
00:14:08,488 --> 00:14:11,329
Right.
Life is like a box
of chocolates.

207
00:14:11,329 --> 00:14:16,231
And Elmhurst
Candy store celebrates 100 years
in business.

208
00:14:16,231 --> 00:14:18,374
And I'll have what she's having.

209
00:14:18,374 --> 00:14:21,837
A Queens couple dies
in an apparent murder suicide.

210
00:14:21,837 --> 00:14:24,546
No. Wrong again.

211
00:14:24,546 --> 00:14:27,487
Denise, you don't have to do
the puns for the sad ones.

212
00:14:27,487 --> 00:14:30,117
Oh, okay. Got you. So,
like this.

213
00:14:30,117 --> 00:14:31,987
Take me to the river

214
00:14:31,987 --> 00:14:34,619
if you want to see the dead body
that washed up today.

215
00:14:34,619 --> 00:14:36,825
And coming up later this hour.

216
00:14:36,825 --> 00:14:39,039
Who took his dong out?

217
00:14:39,039 --> 00:14:41,385
An Ohio teacher did it.

218
00:14:41,385 --> 00:14:44,031
Didn't miss no more puns.

219
00:14:44,031 --> 00:14:45,684
Oh, I like doing them.

220
00:14:45,685 --> 00:14:47,676
We don't get to do them
at night.

221
00:14:47,676 --> 00:14:49,312
Oh, he ain't

222
00:14:49,312 --> 00:14:53,969
that woman. Stay tuned for the latest update
on the man over cannibal.

223
00:14:53,969 --> 00:14:56,182
You know what?
Why don't we throw it to weather

224
00:14:56,182 --> 00:14:59,488
so we can take a little break
from Denise over here.
Keith.

225
00:14:59,488 --> 00:15:02,591
Thanks, Susan.
This week
it's going to be sunny.

226
00:15:02,591 --> 00:15:04,590
Back to you, Denise.

227
00:15:05,048 --> 00:15:06,688
That was it.

228
00:15:06,688 --> 00:15:08,594
Thanks, Keith.

229
00:15:08,594 --> 00:15:11,576
And in national news,
after Lovisa baby,

230
00:15:11,576 --> 00:15:14,356
another infant
has been deported.

231
00:15:15,502 --> 00:15:19,356
Thankfully, we have a reporter
in the field standing by.

232
00:15:19,356 --> 00:15:21,253
Calvin,
how's it going out there?

233
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:23,509
Well, it's
a grim scene here at 11 time

234
00:15:23,509 --> 00:15:26,379
where I want my baby back.
Baby back, baby back.

235
00:15:26,379 --> 00:15:30,367
Says this mother of a girl
who was kidnaped from a Chili's.

236
00:15:30,367 --> 00:15:32,933
Calvin. No,

237
00:15:32,933 --> 00:15:35,244
this is serious.

238
00:15:35,244 --> 00:15:37,997
Sorry.
I just got inspired
by the niece.

239
00:15:37,997 --> 00:15:39,955
Thank you.

240
00:15:39,955 --> 00:15:44,480
It's just so refreshing
to finally see
a strong, intelligent
woman behind the desk

241
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:47,787
I've
Worked in for five years.

242
00:15:47,787 --> 00:15:49,832
Ooh. Can I try a pun, too?

243
00:15:49,832 --> 00:15:52,881
You used to call me on my cell
phone.

244
00:15:52,881 --> 00:15:57,545
It's been 12 days since I'm
in contact with my daughter.

245
00:15:58,356 --> 00:16:00,774
No.

246
00:16:00,774 --> 00:16:04,566
Well, much like I do every time I make
love to my beautiful wife,

247
00:16:04,566 --> 00:16:07,654
I think we have no choice
but to finish early.

248
00:16:07,654 --> 00:16:10,044
Sorry. That was weird.

249
00:16:10,044 --> 00:16:12,791
Why don't you take us home.
There, Keith?

250
00:16:12,791 --> 00:16:14,960
Good bye for now.

251
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:16,995
Channel four is over.

252
00:16:16,995 --> 00:16:20,314
Yes, the news is done.

253
00:16:30,538 --> 00:16:32,811

255
00:16:33,936 --> 00:16:35,079

256

Your lease? Is it?

another arrangement.

Oh, I'm sorry.
This is kind of awkward,

they slap each other and kiss.

Wait, what?

416
00:24:29,437 --> 00:24:32,111
Yeah. You know, in every novella
there's a slap kiss.

417
00:24:32,111 --> 00:24:36,088
You see, in their culture,
the line between passion and violence

418
00:24:36,088 --> 00:24:38,332
is paper thin.

419

Baby, please come over here.

there's no reason to fight.

436
00:25:43,125 --> 00:25:47,348

437
00:25:47,348 --> 00:25:51,559

00:26:09,722 --> 00:26:12,212
Okay, baby.
Let's go.

444
00:26:12,212 --> 00:26:15,191
Okay.
Well, maybe we can learn
a little something from them.

445

448

Would you look at that?

449
00:26:31,565 --> 00:26:34,129
It's like they always say

450
00:26:35,259 --> 00:26:38,017
Love

451
00:26:45,839 --> 00:26:48,856
So I just found out
there's a second Kansas City.

452
00:26:48,856 --> 00:26:51,554
Hey, you guys know
I love Colin, right?

453
00:26:51,554 --> 00:26:54,031
Of course.
He's your thing for life.

454
00:26:54,031 --> 00:26:56,546
Yeah. And we're, like,
totally happy.

455
00:26:56,546 --> 00:27:00,418
But, like, it's normal
to have little crushes here and there,

456
00:27:00,418 --> 00:27:03,695
especially
on someone from the cast.

457
00:27:03,695 --> 00:27:06,005
Who is that creepy?
Creepy Longfellow?

458
00:27:06,005 --> 00:27:07,525
No.

459
00:27:07,525 --> 00:27:10,040
It's Bowen

460
00:27:11,181 --> 00:27:13,448
This is just so sweet.

461
00:27:13,448 --> 00:27:15,783
And, I mean, nothing's obviously
going to happen.

462

I'm married. He's gay.

463
00:27:17,846 --> 00:27:20,784
Yeah. No, Bowen is not gay.

464
00:27:20,784 --> 00:27:23,138

00:27:29,792 --> 00:27:33,342
It's all fake, girl.
He just styles up
the gay for clout.

468
00:27:33,342 --> 00:27:38,166
Trust me.
That man's a p hound through
and through. Ha!

469
00:27:40,375 --> 00:27:41,694
Seriously?

470
00:27:41,694 --> 00:27:44,001
Hello? Hello.

471
00:27:51,872 --> 00:27:54,463
Hey, I missed you.

472
00:27:54,463 --> 00:27:56,315
Of course he's with Gina
Gershon.

473
00:27:56,315 --> 00:27:58,079
We're just here to see,
you know,

474
00:27:58,079 --> 00:28:00,541
slower.
Okay.

475
00:28:01,125 --> 00:28:04,934
So how's the week been going?
You getting along with the cast?

476
00:28:04,934 --> 00:28:08,196
Yeah, fine.
Why? You heard something

477
00:28:08,583 --> 00:28:10,266
Oh, Bowen

478
00:28:10,266 --> 00:28:11,692
What's up? Colin?

479
00:28:11,692 --> 00:28:13,691
Hey. Could work
this season. Keep it up.

480
00:28:13,691 --> 00:28:16,013
- I'm excited to watch you
grow.
- Thanks, man.

481
00:28:16,013 --> 00:28:18,084
Do you mind?

482
00:28:18,084 --> 00:28:19,742
Leaving? Yeah,

483
00:28:19,742 --> 00:28:22,510
yeah. No problem.
Hey, let's take the stairs.

484
00:28:22,510 --> 00:28:24,807
It's only 30 flights.

485
00:28:26,179 --> 00:28:31,373
Scarlett.
Scarlett's my Jurassic harlot.

486
00:28:31,373 --> 00:28:32,293
Bowen

487
00:28:32,293 --> 00:28:35,385
We should be talking you
that way.
I'm married.

488
00:28:35,385 --> 00:28:38,384
Probably shouldn't
be doing a lot of things.

489
00:28:39,464 --> 00:28:40,958
It's better.

490
00:28:40,958 --> 00:28:44,188
Watch it. Mr.
Moo-Deng

491
00:28:44,188 --> 00:28:47,890
Listen,
you know Collins, my SNL brother

492
00:28:47,890 --> 00:28:50,709
and I never did
anything to hurt him back.

493
00:28:50,709 --> 00:28:53,511
I f his wife.

494
00:28:53,511 --> 00:28:56,711
There's something
I wanted to ask you.

495
00:28:56,711 --> 00:28:59,748
What? I guess I was wondering.

496
00:28:59,748 --> 00:29:03,056
What that yang do

497
00:29:08,150 --> 00:29:09,636
Scar

498
00:29:09,636 --> 00:29:11,741
We do. Need protection.

499
00:29:11,741 --> 00:29:14,940
No. It's fine.
I can bottom

500
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:25,002
I need to see you again tonight.

501
00:29:25,002 --> 00:29:27,669
I'll cook for you.
You can buy mine.

502
00:29:27,669 --> 00:29:29,406
Yeah.

503
00:29:29,406 --> 00:29:31,933
Think I might like to.

504
00:29:31,933 --> 00:29:35,661
Am going to wear something
pretty.

505
00:29:36,478 --> 00:29:39,606
God

506
00:29:43,349 --> 00:29:45,165
Oh. Hi.

507
00:29:45,165 --> 00:29:46,266
Hey.

508
00:29:46,266 --> 00:29:48,500
We
hanging out tonight.

509
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:51,949
Right?
Should I come on in?

510
00:29:51,949 --> 00:29:54,435
Oh. Oh. Nice place.

511
00:29:54,435 --> 00:29:56,544
So, are we cooking?

512
00:29:56,544 --> 00:30:00,873
Hey. Hey, listen,
tendies in the air fryer.

513
00:30:00,873 --> 00:30:04,733
I can see it at rehearsal.

514
00:30:06,462 --> 00:30:08,124
You sleep with ego?

515
00:30:08,124 --> 00:30:09,413
What do you want me to say?

516
00:30:09,413 --> 00:30:11,651
I don't. Know that
we had a connection.

517
00:30:11,651 --> 00:30:15,254
Oh, so now we're dating?
I just found out who you were
this morning.

518
00:30:15,254 --> 00:30:16,982
Oh, Simon.
Nothing to.

519
00:30:16,982 --> 00:30:19,333
You got to suffocating me.

520
00:30:19,333 --> 00:30:22,558
Screw it.
I'm going
to Tokyo

521
00:30:22,558 --> 00:30:25,462
and inventing I.
By the way.

522
00:30:28,651 --> 00:30:30,166
Hey, mama,

523
00:30:30,166 --> 00:30:32,467
I need you. To.

524
00:30:32,467 --> 00:30:34,272
You keep asking yourself why.

525
00:30:34,272 --> 00:30:35,857
You'll drive yourself crazy.

526
00:30:35,857 --> 00:30:37,829
I got gaslit by Bowen

527
00:30:37,829 --> 00:30:40,602
Bowen

528
00:30:40,603 --> 00:30:42,925
Domo

529
00:30:42,925 --> 00:30:44,561
Go to Disneyland Tokyo.

530
00:30:44,561 --> 00:30:46,252
Is that Emily Ratajkowski?

531
00:30:46,252 --> 00:30:47,535
Okay,

532
00:30:47,535 --> 00:30:48,604
Lesson

533
00:30:48,604 --> 00:30:50,931
Never get your back blown out
by a gay guy.

534
00:30:50,931 --> 00:30:52,917
Amen sister

535
00:30:53,941 --> 00:30:57,122
Still

536
00:31:09,541 --> 00:31:13,147
Hi.
Can you press 147, please?

537
00:31:13,147 --> 00:31:15,573
- Sure.
- Thank you.

538
00:31:15,573 --> 00:31:17,182
God.

539
00:31:17,182 --> 00:31:20,833
- Oh, you're Mike Myers
- Yes, I am. Yes.
Thank you.

540
00:31:23,388 --> 00:31:25,749
Dan, this is my staff.

541
00:31:25,749 --> 00:31:29,080
- Good to meet you, though.
- Nice to meet you.

542
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:32,234
Hi.
Sorry to bother you.
I just have to say this.

543
00:31:32,234 --> 00:31:34,401
I'm a huge fan of yours, Mr.
Meyers. Oh.

544
00:31:34,401 --> 00:31:36,469
Thank you. That's very,
very kind. Thank you.

545
00:31:36,469 --> 00:31:38,760
- And what's your name?
- I'm Janice,

546
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:43,500
and I just love all your movies.
My girlfriends and I quote,
track, like, all the time. Oh.

547
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:46,873
Thank you.
That's a little weird, but,
Thank you.
Thank you.

548
00:31:46,873 --> 00:31:48,548
It's my first time in New York.

549
00:31:48,548 --> 00:31:52,232
You just never know
what celebrity
you're going
to run into here.
- It's true.

550
00:31:52,316 --> 00:31:55,631
Oh, my God, is that Kanye West?

551
00:31:55,631 --> 00:31:59,602
Yeah.
What are you talking about
with my song?

552
00:31:59,602 --> 00:32:02,071
Come on,
give me one good reason.

553
00:32:02,071 --> 00:32:05,536
Besides that,
besides that.

554
00:32:05,536 --> 00:32:09,908
How is it not relatable?
Everybody got a cousin.

555
00:32:09,908 --> 00:32:12,361
Oh, I guess it's my SOP again.

556
00:32:12,361 --> 00:32:15,638
- So nice to meet you, Mr. Meyer.
- No, it is not. It is not your stuff.

557
00:32:15,638 --> 00:32:18,501
- What are you doing?
- You can't leave me alone in here
with him.

558
00:32:18,501 --> 00:32:21,128
Fine.
I heard he's doing.

559
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:25,894
Okay.
You might. Meyers. Right.

560
00:32:25,894 --> 00:32:27,981
Kanye. What's up man?

561
00:32:27,981 --> 00:32:30,384
It's just. Yay
now. Sorry, gay,

562
00:32:30,384 --> 00:32:32,557
- I guess it's been a while.
- Yeah.

563
00:32:32,557 --> 00:32:36,300
Since that Hurricane
Katrina benefit.
Yes.

564
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:41,604
You know, when I told the world
that George Bush don't care
about black people on live TV.
- Yes.

565
00:32:41,604 --> 00:32:45,758
And you just had to
stand there looking stupid?
- Yes.

566
00:32:45,758 --> 00:32:48,630
So,
What do you been up to?

567
00:32:48,630 --> 00:32:52,149
Oh, me?
I'm in the KKK now.

568
00:32:52,149 --> 00:32:54,755
Of course you are.
Yes, yes.

569
00:32:54,755 --> 00:32:58,602
- How's your kids?
- My kids. My kids are safe.

570
00:32:58,602 --> 00:33:01,680
That's good.
Family stability is important.

571
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:04,608
Isn't it, though? Yes.
Yeah.

572
00:33:04,608 --> 00:33:06,259
Disney stuff is crazy, right?

573
00:33:06,259 --> 00:33:10,606
- What?
- Daddy?
He's on trial right now
for, like, a bunch of stuff.

574
00:33:10,606 --> 00:33:12,680
Oh, yeah? Yeah,
I heard about that.

575
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:15,834
Yeah, yeah. It's so crazy, man.
You think you know a guy

576
00:33:15,834 --> 00:33:19,577
- turns out to be a full, crazy
monster, man?
- Yeah, right.

577
00:33:19,577 --> 00:33:22,437
- So what happened to you?
- What do you mean?

578
00:33:22,437 --> 00:33:25,951
Nothing.
Not one thing.

579
00:33:28,472 --> 00:33:30,631
- Let's wait for the next one.
- Yeah.

580
00:33:30,631 --> 00:33:35,228
Know
there's plenty of room in here.
There's plenty of room
in this elevator.

581
00:33:35,646 --> 00:33:39,654
So Maya's that Jewish

582
00:33:39,654 --> 00:33:42,879
Protestant, actually.
Protestant?
Yeah.
Nice.

583
00:33:42,879 --> 00:33:46,333
Yeah. You know what?
We should take a selfie
together. Come on.

584
00:33:48,415 --> 00:33:51,279
The elevators
are so slow sometimes.

585
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:54,297
- What was that?
- You must have hit stop
or something.

586
00:33:54,297 --> 00:33:57,350
I think we stuck.
Man, we got to be here
for a while now.

587
00:33:57,350 --> 00:34:00,689
Oh, no.
Should we, jump up and down
till something happens?

588
00:34:00,689 --> 00:34:04,182
Nah, man,
I don't like doing crazy stuff.

589
00:34:04,182 --> 00:34:08,135
You don't understand.
I get really claustrophobic.

590
00:34:08,135 --> 00:34:12,632
Oh, trust me, I understand.
I'm a few phobias myself.

591
00:34:13,169 --> 00:34:16,592
But right now,
we just need to relax.

592
00:34:17,095 --> 00:34:19,456
You want some knots? No.

593
00:34:19,456 --> 00:34:21,909
I'm good.
I just got to get out of here.

594
00:34:21,909 --> 00:34:25,044
I gotta calm down, Mike.
You sounded like a lunatic.

595
00:34:25,044 --> 00:34:29,031
Why don't I play you
my next single man?
It's a love song, okay?

596
00:34:29,031 --> 00:34:32,925
Yeah, it's called
squeezing on my grandpa.
Booty.

597
00:34:32,925 --> 00:34:35,530
Oh, wait.
We're moving again.

598
00:34:35,530 --> 00:34:37,760
- Okay.
Thank you. God.
- You're welcome.

599
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:40,566
Oh. This is me.
Take care of yourself.

It's Weekend Update with Colin.
Jost and Michael Che.

649
00:38:02,234 --> 00:38:04,282
Thank you very much.

650
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:07,789
Thank you.

651
00:38:09,268 --> 00:38:11,108
Thank you.
Good evening everyone.

652
00:38:11,108 --> 00:38:15,002
Welcome to weekend.
Update on Michael Che.
Colin Jost.

653
00:38:15,774 --> 00:38:18,797
Well, President Trump traveled
to the Middle East this week,

654
00:38:18,797 --> 00:38:22,450
and if I were him,
I would have just stayed there
because it looked awesome.

655
00:38:22,517 --> 00:38:26,834
Trump arrived in Saudi Arabia
where he was greeted with a lavender carpet

656
00:38:26,834 --> 00:38:28,986
which
matched the color of his tie

657
00:38:28,986 --> 00:38:31,505
and also the length.

658
00:38:31,505 --> 00:38:36,465
They also rolled out a mobile
McDonald's truck for President
Trump's visit,

659
00:38:36,465 --> 00:38:39,562
featuring Saudi Arabia's
most popular new burger.

660
00:38:39,562 --> 00:38:41,962
The MC journalist.

661
00:38:44,066 --> 00:38:46,559
President Trump,
while on his trip, said

662
00:38:46,559 --> 00:38:50,128
that Iran has sort of agreed
to terms for a nuclear deal.

663
00:38:50,128 --> 00:38:54,117
In the same way, Trump
has sort of agreed
to uphold the Constitution.

664
00:38:54,117 --> 00:38:58,671
Many people
in Saudi Arabia were very happy
with President Trump's
visit to the country,

665
00:38:58,671 --> 00:39:02,889
because rich Saudis
love to fly out thick blonds.

666
00:39:05,126 --> 00:39:08,817
The Democratic
National Committee protested
President Trump's plans

667
00:39:08,817 --> 00:39:12,164
to accept a $400 million luxury
jet from Qatar

668
00:39:12,164 --> 00:39:16,384
by flying a banner over
Mar-A-Lago reading Qatar a Lago.

669
00:39:16,384 --> 00:39:19,853
It's the kind of hilarious stunt
that makes you realize

670
00:39:19,924 --> 00:39:23,182
why the Democrats
will never win again.

671
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:27,783
Ethical experts are also warning
that Trump may owe political favors

672
00:39:27,783 --> 00:39:30,264
to countries
who give him lavish gifts.

673
00:39:30,264 --> 00:39:32,590
But based on the way
he left the Middle East,

674
00:39:32,590 --> 00:39:36,080
I think I know how
Trump is going to pay them back.

675
00:39:43,152 --> 00:39:45,881
President Trump has signed
an executive order

676
00:39:45,881 --> 00:39:49,203
giving refugee status to
white people from South Africa.

677
00:39:49,203 --> 00:39:53,227
You know, I could have sworn
that white people had it
good in South Africa.

678
00:39:53,227 --> 00:39:55,820
Must be the Mandela effect.

679
00:39:58,337 --> 00:40:02,601
The Trump
administration announced
that after face
to face talks with China,

680
00:40:02,601 --> 00:40:06,112
it is lowering tariffs
from 145% to 30%,

681
00:40:06,112 --> 00:40:10,280
which is a little like bragging
about taking the knife out.

682
00:40:13,819 --> 00:40:16,118
Robert F Kennedy Jr,

683
00:40:16,118 --> 00:40:20,473
whose shirt collar traps
all the blood in his head,

684
00:40:20,626 --> 00:40:26,074
was criticized
for posting pictures of himself
swimming in a Washington,
DC creek

685
00:40:26,074 --> 00:40:30,262
despite signs
warning it was contaminated
with raw sewage.

686
00:40:30,262 --> 00:40:33,388
Oh, can you imagine
how many parasites are in there?

687
00:40:33,388 --> 00:40:35,154
Said the Creek.

688
00:40:36,148 --> 00:40:41,109
The Department of Homeland
Security
said they may participate
in a new reality show

689
00:40:41,109 --> 00:40:45,674
in which immigrants
would go through a series
of challenges for a chance
to become a citizen.

690
00:40:45,674 --> 00:40:49,293
It's called the real
housekeepers of Orange County.

691
00:40:56,771 --> 00:41:01,603
according to a new tell
all book, Biden's inner circle
revealed that they were worried

692
00:41:01,603 --> 00:41:04,550
the president would need
a wheelchair in his second term,

693
00:41:04,550 --> 00:41:09,052
especially after they were all
done stabbing him in the back.

694
00:41:10,501 --> 00:41:14,145
The white House also announced
that Vice President J.D. Vance

695
00:41:14,145 --> 00:41:18,450
will travel to the Vatican
for Pope Leo's inaugural mass.

696
00:41:18,450 --> 00:41:22,117
And I'm not a huge
fan of his outfit.

697
00:41:23,830 --> 00:41:26,374
Train engineers went on strike
yesterday,

698
00:41:26,374 --> 00:41:29,635
completely shutting down new Jersey
transit lines into New York.

699
00:41:29,635 --> 00:41:33,529
In case you were wondering
why the city smelled so nice.

700
00:41:37,022 --> 00:41:42,424
In what counts
as good news in 2025,
the Menendez brothers

701
00:41:42,424 --> 00:41:46,536
have been resentenced
for the 1989 murder
of their parents

702
00:41:46,536 --> 00:41:51,182
after the judge said
he did not believe the brothers
posed a risk if released,

703
00:41:51,182 --> 00:41:54,067
unless someone adopts them.

704
00:41:54,067 --> 00:41:56,197
That's a good point.

705
00:41:56,197 --> 00:41:59,819
At this point,
I joked.

706
00:41:59,819 --> 00:42:03,424
After several
troubling incidents
at Newark
Liberty International Airport.

707
00:42:03,424 --> 00:42:05,960
Many people are worried
about airplane safety,

708
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:09,401
but one person is more worried
about airplane food.

709
00:42:09,401 --> 00:42:12,482
Here to comment.
You know her.
You love her.

710
00:42:12,482 --> 00:42:14,909
You got her fined by the FCC.

711
00:42:14,909 --> 00:42:18,011
Show some love for mixology.

712
00:42:21,015 --> 00:42:24,511
JetBLue

713
00:42:24,511 --> 00:42:27,298
Doing

714
00:42:28,347 --> 00:42:30,563
I'm sorry.
What is. This?

715
00:42:30,563 --> 00:42:32,915
Down this flight stank.

716
00:42:32,915 --> 00:42:35,237
And I ain't even served
the food yet.

717
00:42:35,237 --> 00:42:40,137
Flight attendant came around
asking me
if I want some butternut squash
ravioli.

718
00:42:40,137 --> 00:42:44,117
More like, but not offer me
that.
Mister, you put some meat in it.

719
00:42:44,117 --> 00:42:47,267
Squash that sucker.

720
00:42:47,267 --> 00:42:50,873
Can't even give me a whole
can of soda.
Stingy.

721
00:42:50,873 --> 00:42:53,770
Want to hand me a dry ass
Biscoff?

722
00:42:53,770 --> 00:42:56,588
More like
you got to piss off Biscoff.

723
00:42:56,725 --> 00:42:58,594
Hell

724
00:42:58,594 --> 00:43:01,597
I'm sorry.
Is all of your stand
up about food?

725
00:43:01,597 --> 00:43:03,559
God damn.

726
00:43:03,559 --> 00:43:05,005
I am starving.

727
00:43:05,005 --> 00:43:08,204
Flight attendant saying
the only sandwich they got on
this plane is a

728
00:43:08,204 --> 00:43:10,406
turkey pesto.
Auch a bother.

729
00:43:10,406 --> 00:43:13,574
All I know is this bitch about.
To lose her life

730
00:43:13,574 --> 00:43:19,378
that rat was harder than my man.
When I get out the tub.

731
00:43:20,188 --> 00:43:22,733
His name's
Maurice, but I call him Trey

732
00:43:22,733 --> 00:43:26,502
because he stay in the upright
and lock position.

733
00:43:26,502 --> 00:43:29,105
Cousin.
His ex-wife.

734
00:43:29,105 --> 00:43:32,132
That's right. Play.

735
00:43:32,215 --> 00:43:34,343
Yeah. I'm sorry.
I really don't think this is
helpful.

736
00:43:34,343 --> 00:43:37,154
Come in. Please.
I'm eating that.

737
00:43:37,154 --> 00:43:42,333
She asking?
Do I want some apple
cranberry compote?

738
00:43:42,333 --> 00:43:46,496
I'ma need a computer to Google.
What the hell that is?

739
00:43:50,129 --> 00:43:52,753
Hey, y'all went
into peanuts off the. Plane

740
00:43:52,753 --> 00:43:55,436
because everybody
want to have an allergy.

741
00:43:55,436 --> 00:43:59,427
If you don't take a Benadryl
and shut your.
Gas up,

742
00:43:59,427 --> 00:44:01,343
the hell?

743
00:44:01,343 --> 00:44:04,858
This Newark story is serious.

744
00:44:04,858 --> 00:44:07,124
And how bout that, TSA,

745
00:44:07,124 --> 00:44:09,372
Putting on that Papa Smurf
gloves,

746
00:44:09,372 --> 00:44:12,936
thinking they can fill me up.
Just because I got a God.

747
00:44:14,056 --> 00:44:16,814
Complex empty stack. What?

748
00:44:16,814 --> 00:44:20,667
That's right.
Stretch, y'all.

749
00:44:20,667 --> 00:44:23,790
You are supposed to be talking
about Newark Airport.

750
00:44:23,790 --> 00:44:25,934
I literally am

751
00:44:25,934 --> 00:44:28,451
listening here.

752
00:44:28,451 --> 00:44:30,716
Menopause.
Been making me whole.

753
00:44:30,716 --> 00:44:33,102
Menopause?

754
00:44:33,979 --> 00:44:37,794
Let's just say, Miss Egg,
you don't need no hollandaise sauce

755
00:44:37,794 --> 00:44:40,980
because I already know how to.
Benedict.

756
00:44:40,980 --> 00:44:45,392
Okay, here you go.

757
00:44:45,392 --> 00:44:49,402
Please. There you go. Not.
Please wrap this up.

758
00:44:49,402 --> 00:44:54,051
No collusion.
Thank you, JetBlue,
for having a bitch.

759
00:44:54,051 --> 00:44:58,267
And if we hit turbulence, Colin,
just take a Benadryl.
And what?

760
00:44:58,267 --> 00:44:59,930
Shut your gas up.

761
00:44:59,930 --> 00:45:03,146
No, Colin

762
00:45:03,146 --> 00:45:04,382
Enjoy the flight.

763
00:45:04,382 --> 00:45:05,525
Mrs...

764
00:45:05,525 --> 00:45:08,740
Because

765
00:45:16,016 --> 00:45:19,913
New research
shows that too much sitting
could damage your brain.

766
00:45:19,913 --> 00:45:24,068
Which explains why Stephen
Hawking was such a dumb ass.

767
00:45:28,140 --> 00:45:33,603
Dick's Sporting Goods announced
that it is buying Foot Locker
for more than $2 billion,

768
00:45:33,603 --> 00:45:37,163
and will combine to form
Dick Focker's.

769
00:45:38,482 --> 00:45:42,632
Annual survey found
that the worst litterers in New
York City

770
00:45:42,632 --> 00:45:44,814
are men from the Bronx
and Queens,

771
00:45:44,814 --> 00:45:46,460
while women from the Bronx
and Queens

772
00:45:46,460 --> 00:45:49,830
safely keep
all their junk in the trunk.

773
00:45:53,530 --> 00:45:56,089
A driver for Amazon was fired

774
00:45:56,089 --> 00:46:00,060
after she was caught on a ring
camera defecating on a porch,

775
00:46:00,060 --> 00:46:03,673
said the homeowner.
But that's what I ordered.

776
00:46:04,737 --> 00:46:07,986
A new study suggests
that people who feel tired
all the time

777
00:46:07,986 --> 00:46:09,718
could have suffered
a mini stroke,

778
00:46:09,718 --> 00:46:13,670
which makes sense
because I always get sleepy
after a stroke.

779
00:46:16,790 --> 00:46:20,362
Know?
I don't take time.

780
00:46:21,442 --> 00:46:23,554
It was a heartwarming
one to end on.

781
00:46:23,554 --> 00:46:26,642
You know, tonight is our season
finale,

782
00:46:26,643 --> 00:46:28,557
and we, I'm not sure

783
00:46:28,557 --> 00:46:31,297
your last joke
took my breath away.

784
00:46:31,297 --> 00:46:33,056
And we have a tradition here.

785
00:46:33,056 --> 00:46:36,729
We're gonna give each other
joke Street
at the end of the season.

786
00:46:38,646 --> 00:46:42,525
Yeah, we're making each other
three.
Jokes live on air

787
00:46:42,525 --> 00:46:45,058
that the other
person has never seen before.

788
00:46:45,058 --> 00:46:50,344
But before we start,
it's SNL 50th season.

789
00:46:50,344 --> 00:46:55,613
So I want to take a moment
to say something to our boss,
Lorne Michaels.

790
00:46:55,613 --> 00:46:59,367
Lorne retire bitch.

791
00:47:00,263 --> 00:47:03,909
Let me run the show.

792
00:47:03,909 --> 00:47:06,313
Wow. Out the gate, Colin.

793
00:47:06,313 --> 00:47:09,325
Well, maybe I should just
tell you the first joke.
How about that?

794
00:47:09,325 --> 00:47:11,031
Oh, I get to do another.

795
00:47:11,031 --> 00:47:13,318
Yeah, yeah,
it's all a joke, man.

796
00:47:13,318 --> 00:47:17,877
CBS has premiered
the first hour long
daytime soap opera

797
00:47:17,877 --> 00:47:20,263
with a predominantly black cast.

798
00:47:20,263 --> 00:47:23,608
It'll air when black people
are home from work

799
00:47:23,608 --> 00:47:26,442
24 hours.

800
00:47:32,735 --> 00:47:35,304
Since you like that,

801
00:47:35,304 --> 00:47:37,108
here's another.

802
00:47:37,108 --> 00:47:42,267
CBS has premiered
the first half hour
long daytime soap opera

803
00:47:42,267 --> 00:47:44,568
with a predominantly black cast.

804
00:47:44,568 --> 00:47:46,938
It's called All My Children

805
00:47:46,938 --> 00:47:49,673
don't know who their daddy.

806
00:47:53,814 --> 00:47:58,260
Movie
theaters are trying
to stop teenagers from screaming
and throwing popcorn

807
00:47:58,260 --> 00:48:01,397
during the Minecraft scene
with the chicken jockey,

808
00:48:01,397 --> 00:48:05,458
because some of us
are trying to masturbate.

809
00:48:05,668 --> 00:48:08,759
But seriously,
Minecraft was a great movie.

810
00:48:08,759 --> 00:48:10,496
I haven't been that excited

811
00:48:10,496 --> 00:48:15,212
since I saw a white woman
drink unattended.

812
00:48:19,231 --> 00:48:22,742
It's so exciting for you!

813
00:48:24,380 --> 00:48:27,852
- I wonder,
- oh man, why

814
00:48:27,887 --> 00:48:31,326
- it could be.
- And it could be nice. Yeah.

815
00:48:31,326 --> 00:48:35,357
A new study finds that the hoots
and grunts of bonobos

816
00:48:35,357 --> 00:48:39,659
show signs of complex thoughts
similar to human language.

817
00:48:39,659 --> 00:48:43,874
Oh. So like that awful
halftime show.

818
00:48:50,882 --> 00:48:52,961
You know,
before I tell another joke,

819
00:48:52,961 --> 00:48:55,990
I. Want to take this opportunity
to apologize to someone I hurt.

820
00:48:55,990 --> 00:48:58,891
Scarlett, can you come out here?

821
00:49:03,704 --> 00:49:04,929
Oh, I just,

822
00:49:04,929 --> 00:49:08,679
you know, last. Time we did jokes, I made Colin
do some tasteless jokes

823
00:49:08,679 --> 00:49:13,066
comparing your vagina to Costco.
Roast beef?

824
00:49:13,066 --> 00:49:15,069
Yes, I remember that.

825
00:49:15,069 --> 00:49:19,495
Well, the fact is, I was just
lashing out because I'm jealous.

826
00:49:19,495 --> 00:49:23,643
I've never even seen
a human vagina.

827
00:49:24,250 --> 00:49:27,279
And notice I said human

828
00:49:27,279 --> 00:49:30,718
because I
once spent the summer on a farm.

829
00:49:30,718 --> 00:49:33,050
You feel me.

830
00:49:34,082 --> 00:49:37,078
Maybe I'm just embarrassed
about my own body.

831
00:49:37,078 --> 00:49:39,095
I can't even take my hoodie off
during sex

832
00:49:39,096 --> 00:49:42,612
because I have more nipples
than a pregnant dog.

833
00:49:43,067 --> 00:49:45,442
Yes, I have heard that about You

834
00:49:45,442 --> 00:49:49,701
and Colin.
I'm sorry too, because I owe you
everything. Oh,

835
00:49:49,981 --> 00:49:52,272
when Colin discovered me,

836
00:49:52,272 --> 00:49:55,910
I was selling
crack outside the.

837
00:49:55,910 --> 00:50:01,708
And now look at me selling crack
outside the American Girl doll.

838
00:50:01,708 --> 00:50:07,025
I'm so thousands of jokes
for an update
and gotten dozens of laughs.

839
00:50:07,025 --> 00:50:11,338
But I've never said the three
most important words of all.

840
00:50:11,338 --> 00:50:13,903
I love you.

841
00:50:15,385 --> 00:50:18,414
Sweet

842
00:50:19,617 --> 00:50:21,963
Truth.
I love you too.

843
00:50:21,963 --> 00:50:24,466
Oh. Well.
Yeah.

844
00:50:24,466 --> 00:50:28,096
Okay.
Before I continue.

845
00:50:28,096 --> 00:50:31,651
Golden State Warriors
head coach Steve Kerr

846
00:50:31,651 --> 00:50:34,278
is here with his family.

847
00:50:34,278 --> 00:50:38,697
I got to meet his son,
Nick, and I love Steve.

848
00:50:38,697 --> 00:50:41,510
I like Nick.

849
00:50:41,510 --> 00:50:46,862
But I wouldn't say I'm
a Nick Kerr lover.

850
00:50:55,112 --> 00:50:59,557
Besides, the Hollywood star.

851
00:51:02,139 --> 00:51:06,722
Some psychologists say adults
can reduce stress

852
00:51:06,722 --> 00:51:09,318
by returning
to a childhood hobby.

853
00:51:09,318 --> 00:51:12,879
Which is why I returned
to my favorite childhood hobby

854
00:51:12,879 --> 00:51:17,179
topping off priests
with my pretty little mouth.

855
00:51:21,431 --> 00:51:24,442
Speaking of which.

856
00:51:40,849 --> 00:51:45,677
Lorne,
I'll do anything.
To run this show

857
00:51:47,686 --> 00:51:52,661
For Weekend Update
I|m Michael Che I|m Colin Jost
Goodnight

858
00:52:06,232 --> 00:52:08,809
All right, everyone,
welcome to day
one

859
00:52:08,809 --> 00:52:12,600
of shooting Penelope.
Secret. Yes.

860
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:16,368
It's a romance
about two women in the 50s

861
00:52:16,368 --> 00:52:18,318
who fall deeply in love.

862
00:52:18,318 --> 00:52:22,552
And, yes, I'm the director.
And yes, I am a man.

863
00:52:22,552 --> 00:52:24,573
So we,

864
00:52:24,573 --> 00:52:27,252
Why don't I throw
to our assistant director

865
00:52:27,252 --> 00:52:31,562
who. And this will make you all feel
better.
Is a woman.

866
00:52:31,562 --> 00:52:33,914
Yay, woman.

867
00:52:33,914 --> 00:52:36,504
Thanks, Greg.
Actually, I'm non-binary.

868
00:52:36,504 --> 00:52:39,333
Oops. Sorry.

869
00:52:39,333 --> 00:52:42,156
Okay, so our first scene up
today will be the one

870
00:52:42,156 --> 00:52:45,434
where Penelope and Madame Wilcox
first become intimate.

871
00:52:45,434 --> 00:52:48,452
And to make sure everyone
feels safe and comfortable,

872
00:52:48,452 --> 00:52:51,187
we've brought in two intimacy
coordinators.

873
00:52:51,187 --> 00:52:53,376
Guys,
want to introduce yourselves?

874
00:52:53,376 --> 00:52:55,304
Yeah. Hi, everyone. I'm Trish.

875
00:52:55,304 --> 00:53:00,501
And this is an insane
coincidence,
but my name is also Madame
Wilcox.

876
00:53:00,867 --> 00:53:03,965
- Well,
thanks for being here, you guys.
- Thanks for having us.

877
00:53:03,965 --> 00:53:06,904
Now, where is our cast?
Right over here.

878
00:53:06,904 --> 00:53:09,674
This is Annabel,
and this is Rachel.

879
00:53:09,674 --> 00:53:11,344
Great to meet you.

880
00:53:11,344 --> 00:53:14,050
So where's the dude?

881
00:53:14,050 --> 00:53:17,701
Oh, there's no dude.
Just the two women.

882
00:53:17,701 --> 00:53:20,640
Yeah.
Okay, so it's just a kissing
scene, right?

883
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:21,908
Right.
That's great.

884
00:53:21,908 --> 00:53:25,981
No, guys, it's a full love scene
between two women.

885
00:53:25,981 --> 00:53:31,674
But how would that even work?

886
00:53:32,114 --> 00:53:33,795
What do you mean?

887
00:53:33,795 --> 00:53:38,900
Oh, no.
He's just confused
because he doesn't get
how two buns make a hot dog.

888
00:53:38,900 --> 00:53:40,518
I get it, I love it.

889
00:53:40,518 --> 00:53:43,830
But wait, like, two donuts isn't
exactly a balanced breakfast.

890
00:53:43,830 --> 00:53:47,582
It's simply too much tunnel,
not enough train.

891
00:53:47,582 --> 00:53:53,417
Okay.
I'm sorry, have you guys never
worked on a queer set before?

892
00:53:53,417 --> 00:53:57,863
Or as us allies
like to call it, an overdue set?

893
00:53:57,863 --> 00:53:59,826
Am I right? Yeah.

894
00:53:59,826 --> 00:54:02,445
Okay. Okay.
Just get it together.

895
00:54:02,445 --> 00:54:03,442
Whoops. I'm sorry.

896
00:54:03,442 --> 00:54:05,326
Yeah. Of course. We've worked on
queer sets.

897
00:54:05,326 --> 00:54:08,858
I mean,
I myself am ally passing.

898
00:54:08,987 --> 00:54:11,993
But it's
different for girls, right?

899
00:54:11,993 --> 00:54:16,180
Like gay guys, I get a
but it's basically of a dude.

900
00:54:16,180 --> 00:54:20,682
I'm sorry.
Do you think lesbians don't
have sex?

901
00:54:20,682 --> 00:54:25,185
Oh, well, I hope this isn't
offensive, but real sex.
No, no I don't.

902
00:54:25,185 --> 00:54:27,591
You know what?
He's just having trouble
understanding

903
00:54:27,591 --> 00:54:30,770
how you'd pay without putting
a credit card in a reader. Oh.

904
00:54:30,864 --> 00:54:35,338
Is it like Apple Pay
where you just tap the Googles?

905
00:54:35,821 --> 00:54:39,159
Sorry, dude.
The Googles.

906
00:54:39,159 --> 00:54:40,982
Seriously? My guy.

907
00:54:40,982 --> 00:54:45,391
This is highly offensive
to lesbian folks.

908
00:54:45,391 --> 00:54:48,800
Actually,
that's not totally wrong.

909
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:51,027
Oh, she's so annoying,

910
00:54:51,027 --> 00:54:55,602
dude.
Sorry.
They are so annoying.

911
00:54:55,602 --> 00:54:58,667
You know what?
Maybe
just try to picture it. But.

912
00:54:58,667 --> 00:55:01,272
Guess I could give it a shot.

913
00:55:08,289 --> 00:55:10,918
Oh. Well, that is nice.

914
00:55:11,214 --> 00:55:16,842
You know, perhaps there's
some online videos of two ladies
that I could watch
as further research.

915
00:55:16,842 --> 00:55:21,120
Yeah, I think I'm gonna go
watch some videos of two ladies
right now.

916
00:55:22,621 --> 00:55:27,391
Wow. Okay.
He was
in a hurry

917
00:55:27,391 --> 00:55:30,963
with the weather.
Wait, what's the weather.
What's the weather.
What's the website.
What's the weather.

918
00:55:31,038 --> 00:55:33,636
App. Yeah okay

919
00:55:33,636 --> 00:55:37,269
guys we got to get going here.
Can we move on with the scene?

920
00:55:37,269 --> 00:55:39,350
You know what?
Let's just do it,

921
00:55:39,350 --> 00:55:43,294
Hooray

922
00:55:43,294 --> 00:55:46,490
Ally passing

923
00:55:58,834 --> 00:56:01,224
What's up man?
This is TV takes.

924
00:56:01,224 --> 00:56:04,353
We talked to your favorite cast
from your favorite show.

925
00:56:04,353 --> 00:56:08,238
Yeah, and we're so excited.
This was our most requested
show this year.

926
00:56:08,238 --> 00:56:11,600
Joining us
today is the cast of the hit
romance Summer Lake.

927
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:13,600
Hey.

928
00:56:13,600 --> 00:56:17,357
Thanks for being here, guys.
We've got a ton of questions
for the whole cast.

929
00:56:17,357 --> 00:56:19,659
There's so much for
the fans are dying to know.

930
00:56:19,659 --> 00:56:23,448
But we're going to start
with the internet's boyfriend,
Danny Cheeks.

931
00:56:23,448 --> 00:56:26,195
Oh. Hey, guys, it's me.

932
00:56:26,650 --> 00:56:28,768
So, Danny,
first question is for you.

933
00:56:28,768 --> 00:56:31,743
Your character is always wearing
his signature hoodies.

934
00:56:31,743 --> 00:56:33,612
Were those
from your real closet?

935
00:56:33,612 --> 00:56:37,586
No. I wish, but the wardrobe
department knew what was up.

936
00:56:37,586 --> 00:56:41,070
They really did.
And next question.
Danny,
how did you get into acting?

937
00:56:41,070 --> 00:56:44,861
Well, I love watching
TV, so I wanted to try it.

938
00:56:45,318 --> 00:56:47,622
And our next
question is for you, Rochelle.

939
00:56:47,622 --> 00:56:50,139
What's harder
being a woman or being black?

940
00:56:50,139 --> 00:56:53,000
Oh, that's my question.

941
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,298
Yeah. So let's go back to Danny.

942
00:56:55,298 --> 00:56:57,412
Was it fun shooting at the lake?

943
00:56:57,412 --> 00:57:00,252
Oh, it was fun, but it was hot.

944
00:57:00,252 --> 00:57:01,694
Yeah. Low hot.

945
00:57:01,694 --> 00:57:04,622
And, Jade, when's the last time
you took plan B?

946
00:57:04,622 --> 00:57:07,226
Whoa. Don't ask that.

947
00:57:07,226 --> 00:57:11,484
Okay, so, Danny, do you have
a favorite on set snack?

948
00:57:11,484 --> 00:57:13,640
Oh, man. That's hard.

949
00:57:13,640 --> 00:57:15,897
Maybe pretzels.

950
00:57:15,897 --> 00:57:18,071
Ooh. Nice. Salty.

951
00:57:18,071 --> 00:57:22,308
And now, Kasey,
you're not as attractive
as the other cast members.

952
00:57:22,308 --> 00:57:25,376
That's not a question.

953
00:57:25,376 --> 00:57:27,138
It's what the fans are saying.

954
00:57:27,138 --> 00:57:29,730
So, Danny,
who are you dating these days?

955
00:57:29,730 --> 00:57:31,538
Oh, I don't kiss and tell.

956
00:57:31,538 --> 00:57:33,080
Of course, that's private.

957
00:57:33,080 --> 00:57:35,641
So, Taylor, you just had
a really bad divorce.

958
00:57:35,641 --> 00:57:38,739
Whose fault was
it? You or your husband's?

959
00:57:38,739 --> 00:57:42,547
It was
a girl, and it was my fault.

960
00:57:43,069 --> 00:57:45,882
Oh, wait.
Danny, is it fun having abs?

961
00:57:45,882 --> 00:57:48,001
Yeah, I love it.

962
00:57:48,001 --> 00:57:50,934
Why can't we get
Questions like that?

963
00:57:50,934 --> 00:57:54,325
Okay, Kasey, here's a fun one.
You recently got married.
Congrats.

964
00:57:54,325 --> 00:57:57,206
So why isn't your husband
a Ukrainian refugees?

965
00:57:57,206 --> 00:58:00,100
That was a fun one.

966
00:58:00,100 --> 00:58:01,882
I had fun.

967
00:58:01,882 --> 00:58:05,340
Danny, when's the last time
you laughed really hard.

968
00:58:05,340 --> 00:58:08,325
Watching TikTok pranks?

969
00:58:08,325 --> 00:58:10,768
Where shall we go to? You.
Deadline reported

970
00:58:10,768 --> 00:58:12,745
that you're
being written out of the show
next season.

971
00:58:12,818 --> 00:58:14,977
Is it because someone leaked
your nudes?

972
00:58:14,977 --> 00:58:19,146
I'm just learning about
all parts of that right now.

973
00:58:19,146 --> 00:58:21,495
Really? It's everywhere.

974
00:58:21,495 --> 00:58:24,354
Now, Danny,
what's your favorite?

975
00:58:24,354 --> 00:58:26,000
Everything.

976
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:27,709
Oh, Danny.

977
00:58:27,709 --> 00:58:29,765
Hold up. Am I being written
out of the show?

978
00:58:29,765 --> 00:58:32,059
Rochelle. Drop it.

979
00:58:32,059 --> 00:58:36,081
Next question. Jade.
Who's your favorite cast
member to party with?

980
00:58:36,081 --> 00:58:37,844
That actually is fun.

981
00:58:37,844 --> 00:58:40,871
- I love going out with Taylor.
- Same

982
00:58:40,871 --> 00:58:44,323
and Jade.
If you could vote one religion
off the face of the earth,

983
00:58:44,323 --> 00:58:45,593
which one would you pick?

984
00:58:45,593 --> 00:58:47,452
No. Pass.

985
00:58:47,452 --> 00:58:50,638
Okay. Here's another.
How come all of your
exes are white?

986
00:58:50,638 --> 00:58:52,510
The pass.

987
00:58:52,714 --> 00:58:55,965
I'm Kasey,
you good face, but bad hair.

988
00:58:55,965 --> 00:58:57,420
You have mental problem.

989
00:58:57,420 --> 00:59:00,855
Excuse me.

990
00:59:00,855 --> 00:59:04,324
And Michelle, what are you.
Going to do now
that you're unemployed?

991
00:59:04,324 --> 00:59:06,985
Is that confirmed?

992
00:59:06,985 --> 00:59:10,499
Yes. And,
Danny, music or pictures?

993
00:59:10,499 --> 00:59:12,398
Music.

994
00:59:12,398 --> 00:59:14,131
And finally, to all the women.

995
00:59:14,131 --> 00:59:17,188
Gun to your head.
Why do lesbians dress like that?

996
00:59:17,188 --> 00:59:18,854
What do you. Mean?

997
00:59:18,854 --> 00:59:21,332
Now, let me rephrase.
If a lesbian was raised in a lab

998
00:59:21,332 --> 00:59:24,905
and never saw another person,
would she still dress like that?

999
00:59:24,905 --> 00:59:29,313
You know, it's crazy.
This is the best interview
we've done so far,

1000
00:59:29,313 --> 00:59:32,108
and we're out of time.
This was awesome.

1001
00:59:32,108 --> 00:59:33,407
I wish we had more
time.

1002
00:59:33,407 --> 00:59:35,841
Oh. Me too.
Yeah. Me too.

1003
00:59:35,841 --> 00:59:38,431
This was really,
really interesting.

1004
00:59:38,431 --> 00:59:41,145
Hey, that's what I thought.
Oh my God. Same.

1005
00:59:41,145 --> 00:59:42,819
Thanks for watching, everyone.

01:03:31,217 --> 01:03:34,612
AND IT'S A NEW HORSE, I'VE
HEARD.
HOW FAST IS HE, AGAIN?

1074
01:03:34,612 --> 01:03:37,231
ABOUT ONE HORSEPOWER.

1075
01:03:37,890 --> 01:03:40,236
LADIES,

1076
01:03:40,236 --> 01:03:42,013
IS EVERYTHING TO YOUR LIKING?

1077
01:03:42,013 --> 01:03:46,789
WELL, I SEE BLOOD PUDDING AND
PICKLED COW'S FEET.

1078
01:03:46,789 --> 01:03:48,958
SO I'M IN HEAVEN.

1079
01:03:48,958 --> 01:03:50,172
OH, EXCELLENT.

1080
01:03:50,172 --> 01:03:52,822
AND HOW ARE THE JELLIED EELS
TODAY?

1081
01:03:52,822 --> 01:03:54,129
OH, EXQUISITE.

1082
01:03:54,129 --> 01:03:57,856
WE TAKE THE WHOLE EEL AND JUST
SMOTHER IT IN JELLY.

1083
01:03:57,856 --> 01:04:01,965
MM, I CAN'T WAIT TO TASTE
THAT TEXTURE.

1084
01:04:01,965 --> 01:04:05,529
AND THE CANDIED CLAMS, ARE THEY
FRESH?

1085
01:04:05,529 --> 01:04:08,147
OH, ABSOLUTELY.
THEY ARRIVED LAST WEDNESDAY,

1086
01:04:08,147 --> 01:04:11,431
AND
WE'VE KEPT THEM IN AN OPEN
WOODEN BOX.

1087
01:04:13,319 --> 01:04:16,473
- AND THE BOILED CALF'S HEAD?
- YES?

1088
01:04:16,473 --> 01:04:20,222
WAS THAT IN MAIN FASHION?

1089
01:04:20,222 --> 01:04:22,089
NOT AT ALL.

1090
01:04:22,089 --> 01:04:25,981
WHAT TYPE OF BIRDS WILL WE BE
EATING TODAY?

1091
01:04:25,981 --> 01:04:29,739
OH, THE MOST UPSETTING ONES,
MY LADIES.

1092
01:04:29,739 --> 01:04:32,527
EAGLES, HUMMINGBIRDS, PENGUINS.

1093
01:04:32,527 --> 01:04:35,040
AND I BELIEVE WE STILL HAVE A
FEW BABY PUFFINS.

1094
01:04:35,040 --> 01:04:36,608
NOT ANYMORE YOU DON'T.

1095
01:04:36,609 --> 01:04:39,786
YUMMY, YUMMY IN MY TUMMY.

1096
01:04:45,796 --> 01:04:50,407
AND THE BLT, WHAT'S IN THAT,
AGAIN?

1097
01:04:50,407 --> 01:04:54,123
BUNNIES AND LITTLE TURTLES.

1098
01:04:54,123 --> 01:04:57,645
AND THE TURKEY CLUB, WHAT WAS
IT CLUBBED WITH?

1099
01:04:57,645 --> 01:05:01,307
THE BIBLE, OF COURSE.

1100
01:05:01,699 --> 01:05:06,130
AND WHAT WAS THAT SPECIAL ON
THE MENU, PANDA EXPRESS?

1101
01:05:06,130 --> 01:05:10,693
AH, YES, A PANDA THAT WE
PUSHED IN FRONT OF A TRAIN.

1102
01:05:10,693 --> 01:05:14,108
THAT'S HOW I WANT TO GO.

1103
01:05:15,650 --> 01:05:19,484
THIS IS ALL SO DELICIOUS.

1104
01:05:19,484 --> 01:05:22,962
MM, INCREDIBLE.
INDEED.

1105
01:05:22,962 --> 01:05:27,690
IT'S THE BEST I'VE EVER HAD.

1106
01:05:29,461 --> 01:05:32,951
I LOVE THIS SASHIMI.

1107
01:05:32,951 --> 01:05:35,314
WONDERFUL, WONDERFUL.

1108
01:05:35,314 --> 01:05:39,241
NOW, BEFORE I GO, ANYTHING TO
DRINK?

1109
01:05:39,241 --> 01:05:43,932
I THINK FOUR BRIMMING GLASSES
OF DONKEY'S MILK WILL DO,

1110
01:05:43,932 --> 01:05:47,742
RIGHT,
LADIES?
INDEED, INDEED.

1111
01:05:47,742 --> 01:05:51,404
DONKEY'S MILK, GERALD.

1112
01:05:51,404 --> 01:05:54,899
DON'T MAKE THAT MISTAKE AGAIN.

1113
01:05:55,090 --> 01:05:59,003
YOU UNDERSTAND WHY IT TOOK SO
LONG LAST TIME.

1114
01:05:59,218 --> 01:06:02,557
LADIES, BON APPETIT.

1115
01:06:02,557 --> 01:06:16,440
Three

1116
01:06:16,440 --> 01:06:20,517
SO, WHAT DID EVERYONE DO
AFTER LUNCH?

1117
01:06:20,517 --> 01:06:24,573
I WENT TO THE BATHROOM.

1118
01:06:24,573 --> 01:06:26,823
I WENT TO THE BATHROOM AS
WELL.

1119
01:06:26,823 --> 01:06:30,733
I WENT NUMBERS TWO THROUGH
SEVEN.

1120
01:06:30,733 --> 01:06:33,944
AND HOW WAS IT FOR EVERYONE?

1121
01:06:33,944 --> 01:06:36,248
MINE WAS BAD.

1122
01:06:36,248 --> 01:06:38,875
MINE WAS THE WORST.

1123
01:06:38,875 --> 01:06:44,069
I WAS WEARING SO MANY LAYERS,
AND I DID NOT GET ANY OF THEM
OFF.

1124
01:06:44,539 --> 01:06:48,946
I THINK THE JELLIED EEL CAME OUT WHOLE

1125
01:06:48,946 --> 01:06:52,680
AND JUMPED BACK INTO
THE SEA.

1126
01:06:52,680 --> 01:06:54,402
YUM, YUM, YUM!

1127
01:06:54,402 --> 01:06:57,097
ARE THE LADIES READY TO ORDER
DINNER?

1128
01:06:57,097 --> 01:07:00,576
I MEAN, I GUESS WE COULD
SPLIT SOMETHING SMALL.

1129
01:07:00,576 --> 01:07:02,316
PERHAPS A HOT DOG?

1130
01:07:02,316 --> 01:07:05,902
WONDERFUL.

1131
01:07:05,902 --> 01:07:08,609
Hu

1132
01:07:08,610 --> 01:07:09,658
Pepto Bismol

1133
01:07:09,658 --> 01:07:12,819
Only

1134
01:07:12,819 --> 01:07:15,043
Flamingos

1135
01:07:31,953 --> 01:07:34,695
>>> THANK YOU, BAD BUNNY,

1136
01:07:34,695 --> 01:07:37,558
MIKE MYERS,

1137
01:07:37,558 --> 01:07:41,647
I WANT TO THANK YOU.
CONGRATULATIONS TO THE
INCREDIBLE CAST AND CREW.

1138
01:07:41,647 --> 01:07:44,216
FOR THESE 50 YEARS.
SO AMAZING.

1139
01:07:44,216 --> 01:07:46,228
LORNE MICHAELS, WHEREVER YOU ARE,

1140
01:07:46,228 --> 01:07:48,830
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO WANT ME
TO SINGLE YOU OUT, BUT
CONGRATULATIONS.

1141
01:07:48,830 --> 01:07:53,520
YOU ARE A SINGULAR MAN.
WE LOVE YOU.
